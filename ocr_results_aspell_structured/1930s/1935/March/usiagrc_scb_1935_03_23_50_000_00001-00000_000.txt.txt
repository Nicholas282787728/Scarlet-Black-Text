Critic Describes Work of Quartet
‘Smooth’ and ‘Pleasing’ to Audience

Dvorak
Program for Strings

Mozart, Debussy,

Termed Natural

By RICHARD KuNCL.

The Grinnell String Quartet, com.
posed cf David E. Peck, ﬁrst violin,
Sabcth Mix, second violin, Margaret
Bentley Strong. viola, and George L.
Pierce, violonccllo, gave an interesting
recital in Herrick chapcl last evening
of Mozart, Debussy, and Dvorak. In
the last Selection, Sarah Inness Mac.
Donald, pianist, assisted.

The entire program was done with a
finish of detail that never fails to
please an. appreciative audience. The
artists seemed naturally "at home"
with their playing. There was no im.
pression of strain at any time, although
the numbers were distinctly ol an in.
tclloctual quality,

“Quartet in G Major“

The Mozart "Quartet in G Maicr"
was a striking piece of work, and the
players made the audience recognize
the importance of the composition by
adequately emphasizing its character.
istic romantic combination at beauty
in sound.

The Debusy “Quartet in G Minor"
carried a kind oi vaguc atmospherc

 

with it. Perhaps it is in this elusive—
ness that the listener experiences his
greatest appreciation for Debussy. and
it most certainly was typical of that
French composer. The artists gave it
the feeling of novelty it required, do.
ing it in such a way to make it seem
perfectly natural in spite pt its strange.
ncss.
Movement, Plcasant

The third and iourth move.
ments oi this quartet were particularly
pleasant, as well as particularly irn.
pressive. The muted instruments in
the third movement gave a dreamy,
sustained beauty of tone which can
only be achieved by stringed instru-
ments. The plucking of strings domin.
ated the fourth movement, and one
felt the increase of life in the progress
of the music; it gradually grew more
and more animated; then suddenly
stopped.

The linal number on the program,
a quintet for piano and strings, was
a tribute to the artistry of Dvorak.
Miss MacDonald was accutely scnsitivc
to the cmotional interprcht-ion neces.
sary to any Dvorak composition. The
audience was aware of her good work.
The artists were most assuredly rc.
sponsivc to what Dvorak suggested in
this composition of his.

Although decidedly intellectual in
nature, the chamber music as present.
ed could not have failed to please.

Orchestra, Chair
to Present Bach
Program Sunday

An all-Bach program will be pre.
sented by the Vesper choir Sunday
afternoon in commemoration of the
mth anniversary of the birth of
Johann Sebastian Bach which will
take the place of the regular vcsper
service at 4:45 o'clock.

Thc choir, directed by Elias Blum,

organist, and a special orchestra con.
sisting of the following: David E. Peck
and Margaret Bentley Strong, ﬁrst vlo.
lins; Sabeth Mix, and Merrill Shelley,
second violins; Anna Knight Ramsey
and Father Pack, violas; George L.
Pierce, Georgia Murray, and Edwina
Wheeler, both; John Bridgham and
Ruth Barloo, flutes; and Elizabeth Col.
latte, bass.

The selections to be given from
Bach‘ include “Leave God to Order
All Thy Ways," by the chorus and
organ; "Jesu. Joy of Man’s Desiring,"
by the chorus, strings and the oboe
obbllgalo by Chester Williams; “An.
dame from the Violin Concerto in A
minor,“ Mr. Peck and the string
quintet; "Prelude and Fugue in E
minor for the Organ," Mr. Elum.

The final number on the program
will ,1» “Jesu, Priceless Treasure," a
motet for five voices, organ, ﬂutes,
and strings. It includes a choral,
“Jesu, Priceless Treasure"; chorus, “So
There is Now No Condemnation”;
choral, “ln Thine Arm 1 Rest Me";
trio, “Thus Then, The Law oi the
Spirit"; choral, “Hence with Earthly
'l‘rcasure"; trio, “If, 'l'hcreiore, Christ

Prom to Begin
at 8:15 O’clock
in Men’s Gym

Featuring a battle oi music with
the music furnished by the bands of
Myron lowther and Paul Davis, and
decorations which will mask the gym.
nasium, the junior class will hold its
annual prom tonight in the men’s
gymnasium. Dancing will begin at
3:30 o'clock.

The bands are expected to furnish
a contrast in music, as Davis special.
izes in fast music. and Lowthcrs forte
is slow swinging rhythm. He plays in
the Fred Waring style and features a
singing combination, Kent Duncan,
president of the junior class, states.

Davis NBC Favorite

Davis and his l2.piece band comes
from thc chermant ballroom in Omaha
and the Cotton Club in San Francisco.
He is a current favorite over the NBC
network.

quther and his Casa Nova band has
been featured in Hotel Lowry, St.
Paul and at Coney Island in New York.
He broadcasts over the Columbia
chain.

Crepe Decorations

"Decorations will consist of crepe
and balloons in pastel colors. The
paper has been hung around the walls
of the gymnasium and over 700 bal.
loons will be hung from the ceiling,"
Duncan states. "These will diffuse the
light thrown upon them, hiding the
gym itself and at the same time lum—
ishing indirect lighting."

The bands will be placed at opposite
ends of thc dance floor, and one will
begin playing as the other stops, thus
furnishing continuous music with no
intermissions, and a constant variety.

Faculty Guests

Guests will include Mr. and Mrs.
Earl D. Strong, Mr. and Mrs. Grant
0. Sale. Misc Evelyn Gardner, Mrs.
Jolui S. Nollen, and Shelton L. Beatty.
