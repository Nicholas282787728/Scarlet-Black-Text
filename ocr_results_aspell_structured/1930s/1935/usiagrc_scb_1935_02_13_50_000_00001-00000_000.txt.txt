“Protestantism is basically a capital.
isﬁc religion," asserted Dr. John H.
Holmes this morning in the third lec.
ture of the twent).firsl Gates series.
His topic was “Is Protestantism a'Cap.‘
italistic Religion?"

Playing Active Part

“The Church is involved in what is
taking place more than the average
per-son believes," he stated. There are
three fates which await the church as
a result of the decline of the present
social System. One will be toml des-
truction such as the governments of
Russia and Mexico are endeavoring
to secure. This is caused by the [act
that the church is an integral part of
the system which the Marxist z‘evolu.
tionaries in those Countries are en.
deavoring to destroy.

A second fate which may ovenake
the church is the complete subjugation
to the government for propro.
ganda purposes such as is the
case in Germany and ltaly, where the
Nazi and Fascistimpvements,mterm.
ed by the speaker as the last dcsper.
ate attempts of capitalism to stay alive
—have been steadily subjugating the
church.

Third Possibility

The third possibility which Dr.
Holmes pointed out was that of the
church being completely ignored in the
change in the social system which is
taking place. “This,“ he declared,
would be the riost humiliating re.
sull of all, for there is nothing noble
in being ignored.” He based his (10.
duction on the [act that during the re.
cent depression the people have not
been turning to the churchfcrsoiace,

Analyzing Protestantism from three
views,.hiszorical, constituency, and
spirit of the movement—Dr. Holmes
showed that the entire religion was an
answer to the demand of a new social
order—capimlism—for spiritual sancti.
ficatlon.

Down_ Aggies
in Hard Game
Monday Night

Grinnell Subdues Cowboy-
With Late Offensive
Led by Klepfer

By RALPH GLIDDEN

Nosing out the Oklahoma Aggics
31 us 23 in a rough, hard fought game
Monday nighL the Pioneer basketball
team turned back the last of the south.
ern invaders to retain their lead in the
Missouri Valley race,

‘ The final eigthoinL margin was the
widest Grinnell was able to obtain
during the contest. Controlling the
ball on most of the tip.olls, and keep.
ing possession much of the time, the
Aggies constantly threatened and drew
into a two point lead early in the
second period, after having tied the
Score twice.

Klepfer Aids Cause

A final spurt led by Klepfer, who
contributed three baskets in quick
succession after entering the game late,
finally put the game out of reach of
the victory.starved Aggies.

lVlason started the Pioneer drive
with a Short goal from the side, Oll.
pliant and Bauer added free throws
and Du Mont a long shot to give the
Pioneers a Six point lead before the
Aggies counted. Mason and Little
both converted when guilty of a dou.
ble foul to make it seven to one.

Aggies Begin to Function

The faster breaking Aggie attack
then began to function, featuring Cap.
taln Stricklin, and knotted the count
at 10 all. Ollphant and Bauer made
good on free ﬂtrows, and Bauer drib.
bled around his guard to add another
bucket. Berendzen dribbled in for two
Aggie points as the half ended, 14 to
12.

After the Pioneers failed to sink
several free throws, Stricklin and
Keeley dropped in field goals to give
the southlanders their 16 to 14 lead
in the second half. Mason and Bauer
quickly retaliated to regain the small
lead which the Aggies constantly
threatened until the final Pioneer
drive.

Bauer Leaves Game

With the score at 23 to 22, Klepfer
entered the game when Bauer followed
Dobson, Aggie center, to the bench
on personals. He quickly pushed in
a one hand shot under the basket, and
Stricklin added another point to the
Aggie count before retiring on fouls.
Ollphant tipped in another bucket, Du
Mont made good a foul, and Kleptor
sank two iield goals before the gun
to dash the Aggie hopes of a last min.
ute win.

Slricklill, Oklahoma captain, was
high scorer with 10 points. Mason led
the Pioneers with nine, followed by
Bauer with eight,
