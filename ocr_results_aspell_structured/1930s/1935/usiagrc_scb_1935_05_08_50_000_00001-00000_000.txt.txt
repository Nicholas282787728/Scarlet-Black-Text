O’Hara Exhibition

of Watercolors

Reveals His Interest in Technique

Great Variety of Scenes

Shown in Work
of Artist

By Henry Alden

Grinncll students should indeed em.
brace eagerly the opportunity for en.
joyment offered them by the paintings
now on display in Main hall through
the courtesy of the Art department.
The exhibition comprises thirty water.
colors by Eliot O'Hara, one of the
Country’s foremost artists in this med.
ium and a well known teacher.
O'Hara has written two books on his
craft: "Making Watercolor Behave"
and “Making the Brush Behave.”

In the summer he conducts, at
Goose Books Beach, Me, the Eliot
O’Hara School of Watercolor Painting,
Certainly the current exhibit is ample
proof that he practices what he
preaches. Opinions may differ as to
favorites among these thirty pictures.
but there can be few dissenting voices
to the verdict that in general they
show supreme technical skill.

New England Scenes

Many of these watercolors depict
New England scenes, several Euro.
pean countries are represented, and
there is also a large group forming a
record of O’Hara's travels in South
America (the sugar loaf at Rio appears
in triplicate).

The spectator is immediately im.
pressed by the vigor and glowing
color of these paintings. The subjects
are handled with the unerring bold.
ness of a master craftsman. Occasion.
ally“ one feels that the effect is too
poster.like; one objects to the garish
magnificence of such watercolors as
the views of the bay at Bio, {The Red

Three Halls Will Entertain
Faculty Members Tonight

Eaculty guests of Gates, Clark and
Dibble halls for dinner this evening
were announced today by the social
chairman in each hall. Earl D. Strong,
professor of economics, and Charles
E. Payne, professor of history, will
be guests of Dibble hall.

Clerk will entertain Joseph w,
Charlton, associate professor of eco.
nomics, and Lester L. Watt, football
coach, and Gates hall will have as its
guests William J. Rusk, professor of
mathematics, and George 0. Seiver,
assistant professor of French.

light." On the other hand, the rich
tones of the "Red Fish House" have
strength and beauty, and a saving
Subtlety as well.

“The Bridge at Bonds"

Mr. O’Hara himself evidently con.
siders "The Bridge at Ronda" the best
work in the collection; at any rate, he
has put on it the highest price, This
sunlit scene is indeed a warm and
colorful interpretation of that striking
bit of Spanish architecture. but there
is in the lines of the bridge inelf a
strange angle that proves disquieting
to the spectator.

The unusual composition of many of
the pictures reveals an artist who is
primarily concerned with the technl.
que of his art. “Cumulus Clouds"
shows an expanse of sky broken only
by the top of a telegraph pole, “The
Canal, Georgetown" is made up of r
series of almost horizontal parallel
lines. One of the most delightful
paintings is the bird’s.eye view of the
roofs of the Bolivian capital. It is
also interesting to note the method by
which in “Sun on the River" the
irregular patches of untouched paper
have been used to reproduce the sheen
of sun shining on water.

Faculty to Give
Graduation Play
for First Time

The annual Commencement play, to
be given Saturday, June 3, will he
“The Late Christopher Bean," a three
act production which was given by
an all.faculty cast in March.

Because of numerous requests for
a reproduction of the play, the Na.
tional Collegiate Players and the Dra.
matic Council decided to invite the
faculty players to put on the play,
Robert M. Brown, president of the
Players revealed yesterday.

The faculty players have agreed to
put on the play, Brown stated, and
the members of the National Colleg.
iate Players will assist with the light.
ing, scenery, and other technical de.
tails.

The production, this June, will be
the first time that members of the
faculty have participated in the an.
nual Commencement play. Before it
has been the custom for students in
the drama department to produce the
play.

This year there were no student
productions available other than the
one.act plays, presented last week, and
due to the difficulty of staging four
separate productions, it was decided
to abandon the idea of having stir.
dents’put on the play, Brown added.
