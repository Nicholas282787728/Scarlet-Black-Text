WELGOlvm BACK

Scarlet and black decorations, pep meet-
ings, tea dances, and torchlight parades may be
enthusiastic means of welcoming back the
grads, but tlle sincerest welcome We can give
you is to forget that you’ve ever been away.
Don’t be insulted if we neglect to greet you
with open nrmswnce you have been here, you
are so much a part of the college that we feel
your presence even after you are gone.

And you who transferred to other schools
before being graduated are still so much one of
us that we take your presence this ,week-end
for granted. If we pass you by with only 8
“Hi! How, are you?” consider it a compliment.
Far from being overlooked or forgotten, you are
so well remembered that We: haven't even
missed you.

Some of you graduated before our time
To you, too, we extend the traditional Grinnell
welcome. Our banners, yells, and greetings are
as much for you as for the people we remember.
Forget you have ever been away, enter into the
spirit‘of the campus, sing “Sons of Old Grin»
nell" with us, and become an undergraduate

FIVE GREATEST LIVING MEN

Great men bring light to the blind, knowl-
edge to the ignorant, and unity to the disor-
ganized. They earn the blessings of posterity
because they bring peace and good will to the
souls of men, illumination to their minds, and
health to their bodies and their institutions.

Who are the five greatest living men‘?
\Vho are the five contempo airy figures whose
contributions to the world mark them as social
Samaritans now and forever? The answer, of
course, is a matter of opinion. Herc is one
opinion:

John Dewc l—Bccause he has given us the
most scientific interpretation of man’s place
in society and nature. He has given us a troll-
lliquc not only for understanding social cause
find effect, but also for bringing health to a
diseased social organization. John Dewey has
brought unity to a disorganized thought.

Albert EillsteillﬁBecause his theories of
relativity have revolutionized pllysl s and
mathematics. He has successfully challenged
the geometry of Euclid and thc physi of New-
ton. Einstein has achieved the most colossal
intellectual upheaval of the age.

Sigmund Freudgl’lumbing into the nu.

HALEWAY MEASURES
(Oberlin Review)

How neutral is the United States?

Congress, before it adjour'ned. passed a neutralr
ity bill which was designed to prevent American
shipments of war materials to either belligerent in
Africa. President Roosevelt and the state Depart-
ment have since interpreted this as meaning such
obvious implements of massacre as.milltary air-
craft, guns. and yet other indispensable war tools.
But nothing has yet been said about shipments of
iron, cotton, draft animals, and the innumerable
other raw materials which Italy lacks and must
have in order to carry on a successful Ethiopian
campaign.

This omission is a serious one. The League of

Nations cannot satisfactorily apply economic sanc-
tions as long as the United states permits contin-
ued shipments of oil and other resources to Italy.
Of course, recent notices that shipments will be
made at the risk of the exporter may make some
difference, but its doubtful whether such a state»
ment will check the sale of goods to warring riar
tiona. The German government warned American
travellers that they were in danger if they went to
Europe on the Lusitaniuiand hundreds went any-
way. .
A complete embargo would cut off a lucrative
trade. It would hurt the farmer, it would cut down
on the profits of the manufacturer. it would pre-
vent a temporary turn for the better in the unem-
ployment situation. But to show our neutrality by
cutting off finished war materials from manufac
turing Italy is as ineffective as to forbid the carry-
ing of coals to Newcastle. If we want security'and
national peace as much as we claim to desire it. we
must clamp down on shipments of indispensable raw
materials as well as on finished products.

Such a course will not interfere with the ap-
plication of sanctions against Italy as proposed by
the League of Nations. On the contrary, it will
give the League a freer hand by removing the pos-
sibility that the United states will nullify all oth-
er nations' efforts by excessive Italian shipments.

Furthermore, a real embargo would not em-
broil the United states in any Italian hostilities,
Complete stoppage of shipments would actually
penalize Italy far more than Ethiopia, because our
trade with the African kingdom is negligible even
in peace time. But such a measure would not pass
judgment against either nation, and therefore could
not be used as a pretext for enmity towards the
United states.

Refusing to sell to Italy and Ethiopia would cost
us millions of dollars in trade. But this loss is in-
significant when compared with the 26 bil-
lion doilars‘(and 76 thousand lives) which America
threw away during the World War.

For good or ill, we have decided on a neutral
course in the present crisis, We must therefore ad-
vsnce farther than the first step taken by the last
Congress, and act in a genuinely neutral and pacific
manner.

Collegiate World

 

(By Associated Collegiate Press) lstudy 112 professors for two weeks

The colleges, of all places, are
showing a drop in literacy. says
Barnard’s clean, Virginia 0. Cilder-
slecvc. One wonders. There is lit
tle question about the illiteracy;
one wonders merely if it is on the
increase. It seems to us that col~
legiste society, like any other, is
divided into literate and illiterate,
has always been so. and probably
always will be, There is in any
college a certain fixed proportion
of students who have never read
anything if there was any possible
avenue of escape, and there is al-
ways a contingent of omnivorous
and intelligent readers.

“Instead of taking things in
through the eye/ and becoming fa—
miliar with the aspect of English
Words,” says Dean cildcrsleeve.
"they take thcm in through the
ear, by the radio and the movies.
This has a lamentable effect on
their spelling and on some other
aspects of their writing."

“Are we right in feeling that the
present student is rather more ll-
literate than were the students of
the past?" Dean Gildersleeve con-
tinues, “Has this condition, if it ex-
ists. much to do with our college
requirements, or does it grow out
of the state of affairs noticed in
the schools alsoithat is, the rape
idly diminishing amount of reading
done by our young people?"

The radio and the movies have
of course raised figurative and lit-
eral hob with the status of learn—
ing in these United states. There
is no simpler way of obtaining in-
formation than that afforded by
the radio, just as there is nothing
that affords amusement with less
intellectual effort on the part of
the audience. than the current
cinema. Not that either of these
two praiseworthy phenomena is
intrinsically debasing; it is merely
that they both depend for success
on an appeal to the mass mind,
and the level of the mass mind is
found at about 14 years. So ......

But there are worse things to
come, say the scientists. The only
barrier between us and illiteracy ls
the American press. specifically
the newspapers. The country is
full of people who read nothing but
newspapers. Already radio is en-
croaching on the news field: it is
easier now, in some instances, to
get one's news over the air than it
is to read it for oneself. And what
of increased radio activity in this
field, my masters, and what of tel—
evision? Imagine the alert tele-
vision reporter, broadcasting pio»
turns and a running description of,
for instance, a session of the
United states senate. complete
with sound effects. Who'll read
the newspapers then? A few peo-
ple surely; there is some truth in
the often—reiterated statement that
“the newspapers will never go."
But the people they will cater to
in the future will be those who
want interpretative and back-
ground material, matter that can
never be instantly prepared.

There are professors who did not
know, perhaps, that “standing in
an awkward position” is very
painful to some students, and defi-
nitely retards their concentration.
similarly, your careful pedagogue
will not "walk around too much”
nor will he effect “odd color com-
