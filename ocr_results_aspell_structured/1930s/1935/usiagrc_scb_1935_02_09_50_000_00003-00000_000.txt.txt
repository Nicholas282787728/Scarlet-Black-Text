THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY FEB. 9 1935.

 

=BORIC=

Much has happened since thc
last edition of this column. The
Jxlnes.Haines.Kead “leCll” in the
quad dining room was a huge suc.
ccss, with a frcc floor show by
Dave Phillips and a girl who put
on a tumbling act of no mean pro.
portions.

The nimble—fingered Talmadge who
does so much to integrate the low
moans ol the College Club ol hestra
got his Sunday dinner dates mixed up
and both he and his self—chosen host
almost starved to death waiting for thin
other to make the first move.

Our ﬁrst efforts along the line of
poetry in some time resulted in
the following masterpiece which
we herewith reproduce with apple.
gies to it certain Mr. Dunklebar.
gcr who resides in Clark hall we
are told.

Men who wear SPATS
Are usually SAPS

It wouldn't be right to let this week
go by without making some mention
of what the cold snap of the week
or so ago brought out. We refer to
the ladies who embarked in ski suits.
Further details we shall have to leave
to the MAL'I‘EASER staff whose glow.
ing descriptions of such things, are
enhanced by their excellent vocabu.
lary.

The collegiate mind must still be
oi superior quality when one stops
to consider the various ways that
studenls adopt in class to amuse
themselves . . . Sutton whiles
away his timc rcading Zane Cray
. . Lew Van Nostrand does
short—hand Te Paske
slceps . Burton confines
hcrscli to talking and giggling
. And then there’s some
gentleman whose identity no one
seems to know wllo listens and
takes notes in his classes .

Des Moines investigators have turn.
ed thumbs down on Des Moines heer
parlors because they found some at
them “half—dark." If such things are
the hall-mark of immorality, the boys
are missing a bet in the dormitory
trunk closets.

We hope we are not guilty of

Iree adverii mg when we announce

that the M. & St. L. has eliminated

Elmer Pinchpenny’s farm from its

schedule of regular stops on the

southbound train. There are fast
trains and (here are locals aml
there are those known to the trade
as “statics”

A Freshman of the stronger sex got
three ES and an incomplete at mid.
semester. Recently his upperelass
sponsor asked him if he had raised
his grades.

“Just one of them,” he said,

raised the incomplete to an E."

Even ii it is’nt truc, it’s funny.

lt is whispered that Knapheide does
a mean dance and has a weakness for
gilded chairs; he was a riot at the
regular Saturday night Kirkwood fro.

IMPRESSIONS or A QUAD
OPEN HOUSE: The conviction
that the punch tastes like Lavoris
. . The trapped tccling that
comes when the houscmothcr lcads
you to the perpetually uncmploy.
cd girl in the corner, introduces
you, and says sweetly: “I’m surc
you both conic hero to dance.”
. Thc sweet young thing
who is so popular that her face
is trostcd into a perpetual smile
of greeting combined with a per.
pcturl frown oi coinmiseration for

her partner when ho is out.

WORKERS, UNITE! ll Relnem.
her, Clrls, the no.date dances coming
up mean that you have to pay lol-
your own relreshmcnts. Bss Juu
might have to check your COAT!!!

The “Little Women" hair.cuts
which thc girls are affecting arc
vcry becoming, it makes a lady
look like an embarassetl ehamclon
who wanted to change his colors
in a pinch and found something
wrong with his apparatus.

“50 What?" snap the quadites and

they are absolutely right.

Clark hall remained in the thick of
the race for the intramural basketball
title by trouncmg both the Rawson A
and B teams this morning, while Dib.
ble retained its undefeated status by
snowing undcr Smith in a B game,
Clark has lost one tilt.

The Clark A quintet downed Raw.
son A 25 to 7, and the B team tripped
its Kelly opponent 15 to 9. The Smith
E team proved no match for Dibble
in the other game, succumbing by a
31.3 score.

In the Dibblc.Smith game ngery
and Rossrnan led the winners, ringing
up seven baskets apiece to account
for all but three of their team’s points.

The Clark—Rawson A game was
nearly as one—sided, with Clark gain.
ing an early lead and adding to it can.
tinually throughout the game. Trum.
bull was the big gun of the winner's
offense, looping in five field goals and
a gratis toss for 11 points. Biklon tall.
ied four points for the losers,

clark B and Rawson B put on the
closest game of the morning, but even
in this contest there was never very
much doubt as to the ultimate winner.
On both teams. the scoring was quite
evenly divided, none of tho perform.
ers being outstanding.

Games scheduled for this afternoon
were: Dibble vs, Smith (A), Gates vs.
Langan (A) and Gates vs Langan
(B)-

Dramatic Critic

Offers Informal
Talk on Theatre

“The theatre, at its best, presents in
an exciting and interesting form some.
thing we all knew before," Barrctt
Clark, dramatic critic and writer, re.
marked in an informal talk at the
quadrangle little theatre Wednesday
evening

”The reason I bother with the thee.
tre is that it makes inc know and
sense life,l‘ Mr. Clark stated. No
matter how few the Broadway pro.
ductions, he considers the season suc.
cessful if it includes one play which
shows interpretation of life with in.
sight, and imagination.

Tracing the development of the
American drama, Mr. Clark observed
that. belorc 1920 the play was not
an adult product, but merely a me.
chanicnl contraption written to show
off the actors. But now, he believes.
modern dramatists have achieved
splendor of linguistic expression evi.
dent in no other period, save that of
Shakespeare.

Mr. Clark sighted the large number
of successful playwrights who have
unsold material on their hands, re.
commending they write expressly lol
the small theatre rather than thc
Broadway production, If the small
theatre fails to accept the challenge
or the playwrights, he co t'nued, it
is not living up to its possi ies and
headed toward eventual stagnation.

"The young person who doesn’t [eel
an urge to upset the apple.cart is of
little use to the theatre," the speakcr
declared. The non—professional theatre.
no live and grow, must be much more
daring than it is at present, he main.
tains.
