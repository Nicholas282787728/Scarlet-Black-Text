ARE GRINNELLIANS POOR SPORTS?

It is with definite misgiving that we approach
the subject of “booing” at basketball games, as
this is a subject upon which editors usually ex-
pound upon only when no other topic offers it—
self for consideration, This time, however, there
is ample justification for considering the matter,
and with the team returning this weekend for
a home stay there seems to be no time like the
present for taking the bull by the horns.

To the majority of Grinnell students the un-
called for “booing” which has been so much in
evidence in every home game this year is be-
coming a source of genuine embarrassment and
disgust. The officials Cannot, of course, be right
every time; but neither can they be wrong every
time, as the consistent “beefing” would indicate,
And in all cases the spectators will do well to
give the officials the benefit of the doubt.

First of all we might suggest that the howlers
read up on the rules. This should, if they have
any element of sportsmanship whatever in their
make-ups, eliminate much of their ignorant but
loud criticism. For example, they do not seem
to know that if a man dribbles into a guard who
is standing still, the former is guilty of charging#
the latter is not blocking. On the other hand, if
the dribbler crashes into a guard who is delibe
erately trying to get in his way, the latter is the
guilty party. These rules, and the ones involving
the back-court line, seem to confuse the onlookers
frequently,

Some definite action should be taken to elim-
inate the “booing" before Grinnell gains a reputa-
ticn throughout the conference as a school of
poor sports. The question is, what would be the
best move.

It has been suggested that the Honor G men
might aid the cause by refraining from “booing”
and doing what they can to keep the other stu-
dents from jeering the officials. Perhaps a pub—
lic explanation of some of the more confusing
rules might help. Or, as some of the high school
teams do, when a member of the Grinnell team is
called for a foul he might raise his hand to signify
that the charge was against him. This tacit con-
fession might at times be hard to make, when the
player honestly believes himself innocent of the
charge, but the act aids very much in preserving
an attitude of good sportsmanship in the crowd.

Whatever means are necessary, the situation
should be cleared up at once. It is much more
difficult‘to lose a reputation for poor sportsman-
ship than it is to earn it.

DESIGN FOR GIVING

The list of Grimell college prize awards, like
almost everything else, seems at last to have
fallen a victim of the depression. As a result,
contests that have been sponsored in the past in
a number of-different fields of competition will
have to be temporarily abandoned'unless some-
thing is done about it at once. The situation
offers some of the not-tooactive organizations on
the campusAand the up-and-coming ones too, for
that matter—a real opportunity to prove their
usefulness.

There are two awards, especially, which it
seems a shame to omit this year, since competition
for them is usually so keen. Last year the con-
test in graphic arts attracted a large number of
excellent entries m but this spring this con-
test must go by the boards, it appears. The
competition in the short story or essay writing,
held in alternate years, has always proved very
popular also—but it too must be given up this
year unless a prize is denoted by some campus
organization.

It is not necessary that the donation be large.
The prizes in the past have been $10, and an even
smaller sum would serve the purpose; or two
groups might go together to contribute a single
prize. But the custom of giving these annually
is one which should be continued, as it provides an
opportunity for giving public recognition to stu-
dent talent thth otherwise might remain un—
known.

TI-IE GRINNELL S

This suggestion should not be looked upon
as one from the prizes and awards committee, as
this group has in no way urged such action. It
is merely offered as an idea for the Various or-
ganizations on the campus to think oveln We
believe the continuation of these contests to be a
Worthy cause and one which other organizations
will consider deserving of their support

WORLD COURT REJECTION

In spite of international insecurity in the
world at large, and the soaring costs of national
defense because of the fear of war at home, the
Senate recently refused to permit this country
to strengthen the framework of international rc—
lations by joining the World Court,

When a vote favorable to adherence seemed
probable, a flood of propaganda was released,
embodying much argument that had little relation
to the principles involved in a fair determination
of the issues at stake. The debate in the Senate
was, with a few exceptions, on a high level; but
the pressure from the outside which was brought
to bear upon the senators was aroused to a large
degree by exaggeration and misrepresentation.

It was argued by foes of the Court that our
adherence would “entangle" this country in for—
eign controversies and disputes, which might
ultimately result in war. The fallacy in this
argument lies in the assumption that member-
ship will result in such entanglements. To par»
ticipate in a judicial body which settles disputes
does not mean that this nation will become a
party to the controversies of other nations. Fur-
thermore the court has no power to Call upon its
members to enforce its decisions thus involving
them in warlike actions against nations.

The argument that the Court is guided in its
decisions by powerful political influences is clear-
1y refuted by its own record. It is plain that in
only one instance among the 45 decisions of the
court it has been suggested that politics or nation-
ality has been reflected in the Court’s action.
It is important to note that in the one criticized,
the decision was in conformity with sound prin-
ciples of international law.

The allegation that adhering to the Court
would mean entering the League of Nations is
based upon no plausible grounds, but rather upon
the mistaken idea in many minds that the one
would in some mysterious way be the result of
the other. As long as the sentiment of the people
of this country is opposed to participation in the
League, we will stay out,

The World Court still presents the opporr
tunity to substitute justice for force in the settle»
ment of controversies among nations. The
Court, which was first conceived by our statesmen
and which has received the unqualified approval
and backing of a number of our presidents, still
waits for our cooperation and support. It Can
only be as influential as its member nations.

Adherence to the Court by the United States
would greatly increase its influence and would
make its effom more fruitful in the work for
peace. Senator Borah’s prediction that the ac—
tion of the Senate would settle the issue for the
time is very rash. Perhaps it is settled for the
lifetime of this administration. But the advance
ing complexity of our international problems and
the increasing demand for and effective machin-
ery for peace will inevitably make adherence to

the World Court a necessity.

A HIT AT THE MONEY BARONS

Congress now has before it a proposal to
eliminate fax-exempt securities. This single pro—
posal has caused a great deal of consternation
among the ﬁnancial barons and investors who
have been using this Clause to escape paying a
just share of the expenses of government.
Strong opposition will undoubtedly develop to
the proposed measure, and its passage is dub-
ious.

However, the passage of this bill will have
two beneficial results to the country at large.
First, it will remove a check which has been
hindering the natural ﬂow of capital into industry.
It is well known that these tax—exempt federal
securities have been serving as a storm cellar for
people who are able to bear the business risk in»
herent in the investment field, but who have
been unwilling to do so because of the tax now
levied upon the income from industrial securities.
The removal of this inducement will naturally
cause more of the wealth to ﬂow into the chan-
nels of trade and industry where it is sorely
needed, since the low interest rates which are
usually prevalent on government securities will
not be inducement enough to cause investors to
choose these securities when the tax-exemption
clause is removed.

A second beneficial result will be the elimin- _,

ation of the tendency for federal securities to be
concentrated in the hands of wealthy institutions
and individuals to whom the idea of tax evasion
appeals. This action has caused the govern
ment to he too dependent upon Wall Street for
financial assistance, as most of the powerful
financial interests are located there.

Congress plainly has before it a piece of
legislation which will be highly beneficial to the
country, but whether or not it is enacted re»
mains to be seen. Regardless of the outcome,
however, a step will have been taken towards the
adoption of a more sane attitude in regard to the
financing of governmcntal affairs and towards
the removal of an obstruction which has been a
serious hinderance to the much—needed flow of
capital into the channels of industry,

run CLomous POOL by rhorne
Smith,

To most Americans, and particularly
to the young people, it will be suf—
ficient to say that Thornc Smith’s
latest book is m the library; but there
may be a few who have not become
acquainted with the work of this mod—
ern madcap and it is for their benefit
that we write,

This is a novel that recounts the ad,
venture of a night when a man and his
lnisuess, both of them in their quer—
ulous middlc years, recapture their
youth through a plunge into a beautiful
garden pool, The fantastic succession
of events which follow this sudden re.
iuvenatien are the sort of thing that
only Thorns: Smith with his whimsical,
diseased iniag'inationiat once utterly
nonsensical and thoroughly delightful
—could write. The latest addition to
Smith’s gallery of immortals is Mr
Henry, the sad bloodhound who could
not small.

BACHELOR OF ARTS by John Ers.
Kilic,

John Erskine has Written another
book and this one is about college
life. He brings to his task his talent
{or witty and disceming dialogue and
his ability to play on the emotions of
his reader. This time I think Mr
Erskine has failed to make his char.
acters ring true. He creates a college
boy who is charmingly impractical
and a college girl who is unbelievably
faithful.

The story is one of life in college
during the current depression. Alex
Hamilton comes to Columbia 2 verit—
able babe in the woods, and four years
of education and experience make huu
a man in every sense of the word,

In the main, this novel by Mr.
Erskine is a story of college life as we
Collegian: would like it to bkhappy.
carefree, a four year introduction to
lite. The fact that the picture he paint:
is not realistic only makes the reading
of the book more enjoyable.
