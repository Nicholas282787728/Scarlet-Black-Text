A REAL PROBLEM

Roger Babson, noted business forecaster and
statistican, made an interesting proposal last week
when he suggested that U. s. Senators be granted
life salaries in order that they might be freed
from the ever dominating fear of not being re—
elected, and hence need of seeing that their con»
Stituents get more than their share of the "con-
gressional poi-k.”

Of course such a proposal from a financial
angle is utterly absurd, but embodied in the pro—
posal is a thought which has probably been
troubling any student of democracy who is earn-
estly striving to find methods of making the sys-
tem function.

It is a well recognized fact that too many
of our Congressmen and Senators are afraid to
think for themselves, blit instead vote in the man-
ner which they think will assure them of re-
election. This has resulted in more and more
sectionalism in the federal govemment. In fact
it is nearly impossible to find any member of Conr
gress who really endeavors to approach the prob»
lems confronting the nation from the angle which
will give the greatest benefits to the nation as a
whole, and not to a particular community.

Thus it is that we have the well known cus-
tom of tariff “log—rolling" which certainly can not
be considered as being political action contem-
plated to-gain the greatest good for the great-
est number, but rather as being a policy Eﬁ”.ed
by selfish interests. Too many interests have
been favored at the expense of the whole, Oui-
Smoot-Hawley tariff act, passed in the face of a
steadily growing depression and declinging world
markets is but one instance. The granting of in-
dependence to the Philippines was not the philan—
thropic motive that it would seem, but rather an
effort to insure a protected market for the Amer-
ican sugar producer, both beet and cane, regard—
less of whether or not the American consumer
suffered. Likewise do we have other heavy duties
designed for protective measures which are not
in the least beneficial to the nation as a whole.
In public works therc is a mad scramble to see
who can get the most for his district.

It is plain then that the representatives of the
people are more or less dominated by the fear of
not being reelected. It is this,same fear which
makes them yield to loudvoiced minorities who
really do not represent the wants of the people.

This is indeed a grave problem and one in
which every wide awake student of practical gov~
ernment should be interested. As for a solu-
tion, that is indeed a problem. Perhaps, it might
be wise to forbid all lobbying in Washington, or
again to impress the American people that
their own government is being dominated by loud
voiced minorities. But until something is done
along this line, it is certain that we shall not
have the leadership of truly national character,
such as we need now. How such leadership is
accomplished is the problem which faces this
generation. And only by study and thought can
it be solved.

TEE GRINNELL SGAIIIHI‘ AND sum

MEN’S TENNIS COURTS

The announcement in the men’s dining room
Thursday evening that men were to refrain from
using the women's tennis courts “until further
notice" brought to a climax a situation which has
long been unsatisfactory.

The situation has arisen from a number of
factors. In the first place, the men’s courts have
in the past proved to be of far inferior quality
than the women’s as any player who has played on
both courts know. A second cause of the difficulty
is the inability of the men to use their own courts.
Each spring when the time for fixing the tennis
courts rolls around, the work is first started on
the women’s courts and then continued in a de-
saultory fashion on the men’s courts. Conse—
quently the men encoach upon the women’s ouurts
having no courts of their own and the fairer sex
naturally resent such an intrusion.

Such resentment against this intrusion is
quite just, and the only way to satisfactorily solve
this problem is to provide the men with adequate
facilities of their own. If it is impossible to fix
the men’s courts up at an early a date as the
women’s, then perhaps it might be wise to draw
up some method of sharing the women's courts.

One solution to this would be the setting aside
of certain hours for certain groups to play. This
would not be a perfect system, but it would tend
to solve the problem, until such time as adequate
arrangements could be made to condition the
men’s courm at the same time as the work is
started on the women’s. If no attempt is made
to fix the men’s courm then a constant reoccur-
ancc of the difficulty is apt to occur. —R. \V.

l Other Opinions

PHI BETA KAPPA STREETSWEEPERS
(Simpsonian)

so much has been said in praise of the student of the

Phi Bela Kappa variety that it may now be well to con.

sider him a little more carefully before we complete the

cpotheosis. Does he really deserve the pedestal and

halo which have been accorded him? Will he be able
to succeed in life as he has in school?

Frankly, I doubt it, and I leave that statement as a
challenge to the honor student to prove me wrong.
There will be exceptions, many of them, for some really
brilliant studenls are able to make good grades in spite
of their intelligence. But a large number of A students
will find their vast and assorted knowledge totally in.
applicable to any practical problem of real life.

obviously, few employers will care to know in what
year the battle of Lutzen was fought, nor are they apt
to ask you how to work a complicated algebraic formula.
But they will expect you to show’ the highly developed
intelligence which study of those things can produce.

Education, then, is a little like art (of which i am
equally ignorant). One can never appreciate a great
by merely gaz.
ing at it through a magnifying lens, and analyzing met.
culausly each blob of paint. The only way to study art
is as a sufficient distance to see the work as a whole,
realizing the correlation between the parts.-

The A student in college is like the near—sighted man
who stands two inches from a Da Vinci painting in the
art museum. He will never be able to see anything
except blobs, no matter how accurately he may recall
where each is placed on the canvas. He will never be
able to remember anything except “the author’s” opinion,
or a statement of the professor in class. Those things
will not make a man a success in life,

Again, l repeat that it is not entirely impossible to
get A grades and still maintain perspective, A truly
intelligent student can make good grades in spite of our
educational system, the professor, the text, and even his
own intellect. But many Phi Beta Kappas are only
collecting face, a task for which encyclopedists are yearly
paid thousands of dollars.

With all this as introduction, I think I can reach the
point rather quickly. If you feel that it is your mission
here at college to retain a photostatic impression of every
page in every text and a dictophone record of every
lecture of every professor why then, my friend, you have
my best wishes for success in your professionias a street.

College Editors
Differ on Value
of Peace Strike

MADISON, Wis. (ACP)—Now that
(he tumult and the shouting of the
recent national student strike against
war has died down, editors of college
papers throughout the country have
reached the conclusion that, if the
demonstration by nearly 150,000 stu-
dents accomplished nothing else, it
did crystallize student opinion and
showed the world that the college
students of America are strongly op.
posed to all forms of war.

While the strike was hailed by the
majority of college papers as a for.
ward step, several student editors ex.
pressed the viewpoint that on the
whole, the protest will have no lasL
ing effect. At the University of Build.
lo. the Buffalo Bee, student paper, de.
clared, “What happened during me lo.
cal part of the national anti—war move.
ment makes one wonder if the whole
program isn‘t just a blind for the
furtherance of communism.”

False interpretation

The Minnesota Daily, University of
Minnesota publication, points out the
false interpretation of the strike given
by newspapers throughout the coun.
try .Summing up the situation as fol.
lows: 'The aim of the strike was to in.
form the nation that college studena
wholeheartedly and sincerely desir-
ed peace. What distorted conception
of that worthwhile motive remains in
the national mind after a day of riots
the gods, only know."

“Peace propaganda is the only in.
herent good of these meetings,” The
Rollins Sundspur, Rollins college pa.
per, declared, also pointing out the
fact that "any scheme that will in
some measure thwart the politicians
and munition makers, and tend to turn
the minds of the people towards a
more favorable view of peace «is in.
deed worthy."

Vigorous Expression

At Hamline university the narnline
Oracle gave its support in the strike
because "it is not enough merely to
desire peace passively. That desire
must find some vigorous expression."

A note of skepticism was sounded
by an edilozial in the Miami Student,
undergraduate publication of Miami
university, which had as its central
point the fact that if and when war
does come, the blare of bands and the
sight of uniforms arouse peculiar emo.
tions and tend to overcome vows
taken during times of peace not to
fight. ’ ‘

Because studean are sadly lacking
in information on world affairs, the
Spectrum, North Dakota State college
paper, declared that "with hits kind
of knowledge at hand and an almost
negligible interest in contemporary in.
ternational affairs, it is futile for
anyone to attempt to mobilize studenti
in the interest of peace."

international Goodwill

The Concordian,=student organ of
Concordia college, takes a decidedly
opposite stand, pointing out that "pre.
valent among the youth of our coun.
try in an earnest effort to establish and
maintain international goodwi. As
the nation of tomorrow, it is to our
interest to carefully consider the pass.
ibiiities for assisting in freeing the
world from the enemy of war.” r

Realizing that the strike itself may
not accomplish very much, the ldaho
Bengal, University of ldaho paper,
believes “the cumulative effect of
many of these moves, stretching over
a period of years, is bound to be
great,"

Greatest student lultiative

While objecting to calling the pro.
(est a “strike” because of the un-
pleasant connotations given, the New
Mexico Labo, University of New Mex-
ico publication, feels that the move.
ment has value because “it has been
important in the crystallization of
student thought and a decided impet—
us to student initiative.”

The Daily Dartmouth, Dartmouth
college student paper, supported the
strike because “in time of peace we
must build up an i_war sentiment to
the point where it will be able to
fight cooperatively against the emo.
tlonal hysteria of wartime."

CHAPEL
NOTES

Bible stories centering about Daniel
in the days of Nebuchadnezzer were
recounted by Amy Elilabeth Blagg,
assistant professor of zoology. in her
chapel talks this week.

“The positive results of one of the
early experiments in nutrition were
not conducted by a famous scientist,"
began Miss Blngg, "but by a captive
Jewish boy still in school. DanieI per.
suaded the servant of the king to try
out a ten day experiment. The child.
ren, who had been fed portions of
the king‘s meat and wine were to
be given vegetables and water. At
the end of the ten days,” she continued.
“their faces appeared fairer and letter
than all the children who ate the por.
tion of the king's meat.”

Comparing the firey furnace, into
which the three frientb of Daniel
were thrown bemuse they refused to
worship the image set up by the king,
with the ﬁrey furnace of the present
day difficulties, which demand sacri.
fices and self.discipline, Miss Elagg,
declared that we could survive the
ordeal as well as did the friends of
Daniel.

“Complacency, self-satisfaction, and
self.sufficiency are qualities which we
all dislike in others, she continued,

selves are guilty of these qualities. A
