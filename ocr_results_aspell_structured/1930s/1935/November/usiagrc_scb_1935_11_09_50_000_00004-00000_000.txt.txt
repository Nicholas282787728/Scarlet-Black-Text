W ell, to start with, we take tobacco

from our own Southland— mild ripe
tobacco with lots of natural ﬂavor but
no harshness or bitterness.

from across the seas. These Turkish
tobaccos, you may know, have a ﬂavor
and fragrance entirely diEerent from
our OW“.

AS A THIRD STEP—
These tobaccos are cross-blended—
welded togetherethe best way we’ve
found to get a more pleasing ﬂavor
and a better taste in a cigarette.
