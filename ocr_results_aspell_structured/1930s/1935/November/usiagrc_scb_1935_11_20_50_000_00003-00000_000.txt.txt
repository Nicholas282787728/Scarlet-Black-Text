Artist Accidentally Discovered
Interest in Stained Glass

 

The stained glass exhibit, which
will be on display here beginning
Dec. 5, comes from the studios of
a man who stands at the pinnacle
of his profession as America's
leading master of stained glass,
Nicola D'Ascenzo, Miss Edith A.
sternfeld, director of art, revealed
today

Mr. D'Ascenzo is an etcher.
a painter, and a conscientious stu-
dent of Renaissance stained glass.
However, he is not a copyist nor a
mere technician, but a creative art—
ist of much versatility, according
to Miss stemfeld,

The historical and contemporary

stained glass pieces which will be
shown here have distinctive quell»
tics of vigor. directness, dignity
and simplicity. Their making res
quires constant and exacting su-
pervision, necessitating always an
intimate relationship between the
master artist and his workmen.

Mr. D’Ascenzo happened upon
his life work by accident. Although
he had always been interested in
art and had decided upon a career
of interior decoration, his observ-
ance of hidcous stained glass win-
dows prompted him to devote his
life to pioneering in the field of
glass making,

 

Grid Siuad—

(Continued from page 1)

Seeks Backﬂeld Men

In an effort to find much needed
backfield material, Coach Watt
has converted Hayward, regular
right end, into a back, while Snow,
likewise a lineman, has been shift-
ed to the ball carrying duties,

The game Saturday will mark
the finale for the grid careers of
five lettermen. 0f thsee, two will
be unable to play—Bauer and
Trumbull, while the others, Cap-
tain Bradley, Klepfer and Safris,
will be playing their last tilt on a
foreign field.

Cornell strong

Cornell appears stronger than
ever this year, and will be bringing
to a close a highly successful sea-
son in which the Purple held the
Iowa state aggregation to a 5.5
tie. Cornell seems to have reached
peak form, snowing Simpson under
by a score of 33—0 last week-end.
Coe and Cornell played a scoreless
tie earlier in the season, while the
Kohawks administered a terrific
3470 heating to the Pioneers last
Saturday. From this comparison,

 

the Oomeilians seem favorites in
the coming tilt.

Coach Dick Barker, Purple men-
tor, has 12 lettermen from which
to pick his starting lineup and will
be able to present a strong lineup

To Hold Pep Meeting

a pep niecting will be held
Friday night in the little thea—
ter at the quadrangle beginning
at 7:30 o'clock, according to an
announcement by John Spence,
chairman of the student Coun-
cil pep committee.

The program will consist of
short speeches, music and danc-
