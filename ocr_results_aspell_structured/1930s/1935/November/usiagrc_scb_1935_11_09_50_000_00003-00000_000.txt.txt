r n: t

Rawson hall Wednesday annexed
the men's intramural speedball
tournament by turning back Clark,
7 to o, to remain undefeated in
five games. Dibble and Langan
finished in a tie for second place,
followed in order by Gates, Smith
and Clark.

\ Little Opposition

Clark furnished little opposition
for Rawson, the Kelly men chalk-
ing up their fifth victory without
difficulty. Clark made two weak
challenges in the first half but
failed to score. Riley and Harvey
both scored from the field and Mc-
Murray made a free kick to ac-
count for Kelly's points.

Dibble took 16 quarters to
win over Langan. The two teams,
who tied for second place honors,
had played two tie games before
Thursday afternoon when Dibble
won the third game e to 5.

Dibble Rallies Late

Langan led 5 to 0 going into the

third quarter before the Dibble

boys turned on the “heat". Weath-
‘erson and Dean scored on kicks
and Blaikie caught a pass for Di —
ble's points Warner kicked and
Appelqulst took a pass for Lang-
an's five points.

Smith and Clark still have a tie
lgame to play, but there is doubt
!as to whether or not the cellar
'teams will tangle, If Clark dee
,feats Smith, the two halls will he
liked for last place; if the Smith
team wins, it will be tied with
Gates for the fourth poSition, while
Clark will remain in the bottom
position.
