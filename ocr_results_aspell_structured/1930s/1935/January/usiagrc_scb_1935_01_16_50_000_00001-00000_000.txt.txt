world fame as a play critic and lec.
lurer on dramatics, will be brought
to Grinnell on Feb. 6 as leader of an
informal discussion on drama work,
Sara Sherman Pryor, dramatic direc.
tor, announced yesterday. The Grin.
nell chapter of National Collegiate
Players is sponsoring Mr. Clark's ap.
pearanee.

His topic will be, ”New Frontiers of
American Drama."

The discussion will deal with the
part-the college is playing in the devel.
opment of the American drama and
theater. Clark has expressed the opinion
that‘the Little Theater productions are
far more important than those on
Broadway in this development and
that eventually plays will have their
first presentation in the small theaters
rather than before metropolitan sud.
lences.

are widely read and he has gained
much notice as a translator of French
and ltalian plays. At present he is
literary editor for the Samuel French
Publishing company

He is, perhaps best known at Grin.
hell as author at the text book -
injthe college drama department, “A
Study of the Modern Drama." He has
written between as and to books on
various phases of the theater and
drama work.

in addition to his longer works on
the theater. he is a frequent contribu.
tor to various magazines. Included
among those to which he contributes
regularly are Theatre Arts, Outlook,
Shadowland, Poet lore and Drama.

Hero During Tour

Mrmglark’s appearance here will be
one of a number he plans to make
from coast to coast during the month
of February. He will come to Grin.
nell directly from Chicago, and will
speak on the ‘cllowlng day in lowa
City.

All students who are interested are
invited by the sponsors to attend the
talk by Mr. Clark. While present
plans provide for the discussion to be
held in the quadrangle drawing room,
Mrs. Pryor stated yesterday that the
meeting will be transferred to the
little theater if the crowd can not be
accomodated.
