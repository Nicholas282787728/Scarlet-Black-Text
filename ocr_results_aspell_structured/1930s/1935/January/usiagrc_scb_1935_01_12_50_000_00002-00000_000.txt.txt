SCIENCE IN THE COURT

In the past few decades scientific methods
have been introduced in practically every field
of endeavor, with one very notable exception —m
the field of law. But with at least six scientific
methods of crime detection available, the courts of
the United States continue to ignore their possi-
bilities and to use obsolete and inefficient meth-
ads.

The current Hauptmann trial, with its bung-
ling procedure involving a mass of circumstantial
evidence but, as yet, not a single item of con-
clusive proof, emphasizes the necessity for aban-
donment of traditional means of prosecution for
modern, scientiﬁc means.

Modern crime detection laboratories have prOe
. duced three, practical ”lie detecting" machines
( which have proved themselves fool proof in al-
most every case in which they have been used.
A “truth serum” which blocks off the portion of
the brain which is the seat of falsehood has been
discovered and the feasibility of its use proved
beyond contradiction. The psychologist has for
a number of years urged the use of “word as—
sociation” tests as a means of crime detection.
And the courts still insist upon using the old
“Where were you on the first of June?” routine,
relying upon it alone for forcing confessions and
proving guilt!

While the evidence revealed by a single one
of these various crime detectors might be mis-
leading, if the suspect was required to submit to
tests by a whole battery of them, similar indicae
tions from all would offer proof conclusive enough
to satisfy the most dubious court. It is, perhaps,
questionable whether these results should be used
as legal evidence, but in all but a small minority
of the cases, such conclusive evidence of six?
would very likely bring a confession. Certainly
the facts indicated by the results of a group of
such tests should be just as acceptable evidence
as the chain of circumstances which point to
Hauptmann’s guilt.

It will probably be some time before the
American courts, notoriously conservative, will
accept such proof as court evidence; but the time
is bound to come, and the acceptance of such evi»
dence will mark an immeasurable step forward in
the efficiency and justice of court procedure.

A WORTHY PRECEDENT

The recent decision of the arbitration com—
mission awarding damages to Canada for the
sinking of the Canadian ship I’m Alone gives ad-
ditional proof that arbitration can be successfully
used as a means of settling international disputes.
This particular episode was a premier scandal
of the Prohibition era. Two United States Coast
Guard cutters hailed the Canadian ship, I’m
Alone, off the coast of Louisana. The ship did

not heave to and the cutters started in pursuit
finally sinking the ship 200 miles off the Louisana
coast, far beyond any legal limit which the United
States could claim to control.

This sinking was obviously a violation of the
freedom of the seas in n manner similar to that
against which the United States prote<ted so
vigorously prior to the War of 1812. War resulted
then, but in this case recourse was made to arbi-

tration instead of guns.

This action lends an encouraging note to the
cause of peace since it proves that there is a prac-
tical means of settling international disputes with—

out warfare.

Arbitration is indispensible in promoting
peace and the successful settlement of the Im
Alone case in this manner can not help but lend
useful and encouraging support to the case of those
who are interested in making peace possible. May
there be more cases of successful arbitration.

l Other Opinions

THE ONLY HorE FOR PEACE
(lvliehignn Daily)

The problem of peace is so old that many despair of
of solving it, yet so young that few, if any, have sug—
gested any sort of fundamental solution.

America wants peace. Everybody says so, and has
said so for years, ever since it came to be realized that
the Great war might not have ended all war. But be.
cause everybody can so easily chant “Feacel,” even as
they carelessly talk about “freedom of the press’ and
many other things, two unfortunate conditions have come

about.

In the first place, the clLexpl‘essed desire. for peace
has given many persons a false sense of security. They
do not want to believe that war is inevitable, so they
don't believe it. On the other hand, many who sincerely
seek an answer and a program that every civilized adult
may support with a firm conscience, find the only EXISL
ing organizations dedicated to the task of making people
shout “Peace!”

The fallacy behind most pacifist movements is the
belief that war can be done away with simply by washing
it did not exist, by getting enough people to abhor it and
swear against it. ‘

Some persons will always be willing to sign an 0x.
lord pledge and believe in it sincerely. Some will always
forcibly oppose conscription—even when war time
activities make it most unpleasant. But the few who
wholeeheartedly join and fight for these groups are not
likely to be enough to break the back of war as long as
certain things are true about the world in which we
live.

Going ubout stopping wars by treating the causes
is a long, hard way to which it is wellenigh impossible
to secure vociferous cunvem. It isn’t dramatic in nature.
And the Work will drag on through the years as peace
fervor rises and wanes. Even if the actual research and
study are left to trained individuals, an enlightened public,
opinion must be consmntly alert to urge on the wor
.and see it adopted by government authority.

At Minnesota a note of optimism is apparenLas a
campus.wide peace committee is organized, including
present peace groups which have been warring among
themselves and designed to be broad enough in purpose
to include all shades of opinion. Its proponents hope that
it will be able to “find the most effective means for the
expression of campus anti—war sentiment and agree on
some constructive program in the cause of peace.”

What success will attend the Minnesota eff .
to say. Obviously, neither this peace committee or any
other will have an easy road to follow. Those who are
first to affirm their interest in peace may be the last
to respond to a movement offering such remove possibil.
ities, and, lacking popular support, the committee may
die before it can suggest any sort of practical progmm.

But one might hope that in a university community,
if anywhere, there could be gathered sufficient intelligence
to start a significant move of this kind.

The Book N 00

By TED KLEIN

Many of the book review magazines
announce the selection of the best
books in their opinion written in the
last year, Most of the books chosen
in these lists can be found on the
rental book shelf of the college library,
Look them ever.

The following is a short review of
a book which found high regard with
most critics.

so RED THE ROSE, by Stark Young
This is a story of the deep South in
the days just before and during the
Civil War. It centers about two old
families, the McGehees of M‘ontrose
and their kin, the Bedfords of Porto.

ete picture of what was best in
tho. gracious civilizaﬂcn which the

velopecl, the things it cherished and
thought worth living and dying for.

The author is manifestly not inter.
ested in developing strong characters,
and when the book has been finished
it is not vivid personalities nor even
vigorously told incldean which linger
in the mind’s eye. Rather it is the
remarkable extent to which he has
succeeded in recapturing the particu.
lar charm of a period, when to live
in the spell of its environment meant
living graciously, with dignity, and,
above all, with an indomitable zest
for the best that life could give, Funda.
mentally he is not writing a history
truthful in every detail, but like many
another he has fallen in love with
these brave sensitive people who lived
lull-i1! twilight of a serene and gl‘ac.
ious civilization and inevitably tumcd
defender of their cause.

The particular appeal of this book
lies in the fact that it is a glimpse in.

 

aristocracy of the old South had do.l

grand stale and when life had not been
reduced to the values of time and
money. It is not easy for the Amer.
ican (£1984 to realize that such a eiv.
ilizntion, at once substantial and ideal.
istic, existed in a land where stand.
ardization and regimentatien do their
best to strip him of whatever individ.
uality he may possess. This book
makes these almost legendary days
so real that one is left hoping fervent,
ly that their return is scheduled in the
present cycle of history.

all garnered from beyond the free
throw line. For Gates, Eugene Jonge.
waard was high man with two field
goals and two free throws for six
points.

At half time Gates led the victors 9
to 8 and increased its lead in the last
half, 12 to 8, only to be nipped by the
Smith rally in the last quarter.

In the second game, the Gates 13
team had little difficulty, trouncing
the mith E team 34 to 10.

Fi i led the scoring with four field
goals for eight points, while Anderson
and Ariana each annexed seven pains

Anybody knows that a good propor.
tion of the conversation among mem.
bers of one sex is about members of
the other sex.

Young women in a writing seminar at
Wellesley college were enough inter.
osted in each other's opinions about
men to take a written canvass of the
class in order to determine each girl’s
qualifications for her “ideal man."
One list, that of a brilliant peetess,
includes these points:

1. He must take a woman as a per.
son, not as a woman,

2, He must be honorable.

3. He must be tolerable in every
way—this ‘5 most important.

4. He must have a broad interest
(character. social ease, intelligence).

Another young author’s list was very
short:

1. He must be generous.

2. He must be ambitious.

The third list, that of a millionaires
daughter:

1. He should be graciousithe sort of
graciousness that goes with a pipe and
tweeds.

2. He should be helpless at times.

a. He must be a real personithree
fourths of all men have only a super.
ficial knowledge of life,

4. He doesn't have to have a “moral"
character,

Strangely, not one of the girls men-
tioncd wealth or social position. After
the answers were read in the class, a
visiting married woman asked for the
floor and declared, “You girls have
been picturing saints, not men. in
the first place, he should be intensely
masculine. Then he should be broad.
minded—that’s about all you can
ask."

A physics class out at the University

laws of the solar system. A pendulum
hanging from the ceiling was set to
swinging and its path was marked on
a flat table. After i few hours mem.
bers of the class were shown that the
angle of the pendulum to the marked
course had changed, indicating thi
turning of the earth.

he made his way out of the room,
