First Organization Founded
to Promote Campus

Cooperation

By Stephen viggcrs

There is an anemic institution on the
Grinnell campus known as “The Stu-
dent Council oi Grinnelt College."
The history oi this organization as
gathered irom musty and crumbling
pages oi ancient Scarlet and Blacks
brought to light the frail and precar.
ious existence this instituion has led
since its birth in 1910,

Time and again it has nearly perish.
ed from lack of nourishment, but at
the zero hour students and faculty
alike have rushed to the bedside and
madly performed so-callcd major oper-
ations but with little success. The
patient's constitution rallied slightly
but always sank back into is habitual
iassitude.

Organized by Main

Delving into the archives oi this in.
stitution, we find that it was ﬁrst
christened "The Grinnell College
Council“ and was organized by former
president John H. T. Main.

Five men, five women and repre-
sentatives oi the iaculty composed
this first body. How these members
were selected is a deep mystery, but
it is known that the group usually
met every Monday afternoon.

Main Eager [01‘ Success

President Main was eager for the
success oi this experiment, by which
he hoped to get closer cooperation
between students and iaculty, and
granted all reasonable demands oi the
council. The apportionment of the
semester ice was the main acti ’ty
to this body and has remained so to
the present time.

The World War upset the organiza—
tion, but during_the spring oi 1921
a' new constitution was drawn up in

the games, as the scores would indi—
cate, were well played in spite of the
very poor condition of the baseball
field.

Seven games are scheduled ior- next
week’s round oi play in the intramural
hardball tournament. Two will be
make—up contests of games postponed
last week because oi rain, whlle the
other five will be the regularly sched—
uled round of play. The makeup

diamond located at Merrill park. All

Tuesday, hawson vs. Gates, Wednes—
day, Langan vs, Clark. Thursday,

ur-day, Smith vs. Gates; and Dibble
vs. Clark.

The major victory oi the week was
racked up by Dibble as they defeated
the pre.season iavorites, Langan, yes.
terday by a 271 count, Dibble crossed
thc‘Langan boomer-i by sending Harn-
ack to the mound in placc oi Stanley.
Harnack, with a slow breaking curve
and excellent control, outpitchcd
Henningsen and gave up only two
hits over the five inning route.

Lungotr Wins

Langan won the other feature oi

the week by defeating Gates 3.2.
This was another well played game
with Gates gaining and early inning
lead and. holding it till a late rally
by Langan shoved the winning mark.
ers across in the last stanza.
Dibble dcicated Smith in the third
game by a 6-3 score. Stanley was
master} oi the situation throughout,
giving me south‘cirdcrs but three hits.
These bunched in the that inning,
brought Smith a short lived lead,
which was easily‘ overcome as Dibble
scored in every inning.

Academic Warfare Rages on Campus
Over Pronunciation of Phi Beta Kappa

Members of Local Chapter
Disagree on Method

When Questioned

By Edward Fitzpatrick

After considerable research work,
involving the use of four file clerks
and a corps of staii workers, a mo.
mentous decision has been reached
concerning a most annoying problem.
Four year, scholars, academicians,
students, alphabetarians, tyros, dons,
abeccdarians, philosophers, pedal-its,
and parents have worried, worked,
puzzled, though, iought. and grown
gray trying to solve it.

Twice during the last century, the
State department was forced to send
polite notes to foreign nations con.
cerning it. The marines were landed
in the Shetland Islands to quell elec<
tion riots when the matter was put
to vote.

Perhaps the classic example oi
its importance was the recent incorp-
oration of a plank in the next Repub~
Iican platform upholding the modem-
ist viewpoint of the matter.

The pronunciation oi the three
Greek letters of the name of the most
famous honorary society for extra—
intelligent collegians has been, and
still is, a matter for serious debate.
For example, if you hold with the
classical school you must say the
words to sound like this, l‘iee baitah
kahppah." .» ' '

 

But at once a storm of dissenting
opinion arise. The society was iound—
ed over a 100 years ago when the
Anglicized method of

 

Latin and Grcek words pas used They,

pronouncing

said, “he beatah kappah," in the days
oi Napoleon and Edgar Allen Poe,
(The pa’ people!)

Still another method of pronuncia-
tion in use, sanctioned by the society
itseli, which is, "iie baitah kappah."
Clearly a hybrid resulting from the
close association of the two other
Iorms. What to do?

A question to a iew of the members
oi the organization on the campus
showed a similar ditierence of opinion.
J. W. Charlton admitted, with reserva.
tions, that both methods were in use
and' that, in his opinion, both were
probably all right. C. H. Niemcyer and
Henry Alden stood on the opinion that
the "fie's”- were right, inasmuch as
the Council of the United Chapters
had so decreed it.

'Katherine'Koch, a new member,
ventured to break from the trend and
admitted liking the original Greek
pronunciation beginning with “fee.”
Robert Snavely, also a new member,
stuck to the oiiicial version but ad.
mitted having been brought up ml
the “ices." Score: At the end oi the
iiith iramc, the “ties" were loading
2 to 11/2 with one round declared a
draw,

Unconiixmed rumors lead one to be-
lieve that the “fee’s” have unexpected
strength, but as yet, the iinal returns
have not been turned in.

According to E. B. T. Spencer, protessor
of Greek, common usagc in the past
has tended to make “fie baitah kap-
pah" the accepted pronunciation, “It
would be unnecessarily pedantic," said
Mr. Spencer, “to insist upon the true
Greek pronunciation, ‘lee baitah kahp.
pah‘ or tht true Anglicized version,
‘fie beatah kappa.’

Which leaves us just about where
we storied. Fic on the whole business.

QUALIFIES TWICE

Kuncl Installs
New Council

Duncan Demands Support
of Student Body

“We can only start the Student
Council, it's up to you to keep it mov.
ing,” declared Kent Duncan, new presi—
dent oi the Student Council, in his
inaugural address Friday morning at
Chapel.

“it could iunction ior the students
he aserted, “if it represented the
united opinion oi the school. The
trouble with the present organization
is that it represents only individual
points oi view.”

Alternatives Pacing Council

“Three alternatives iace the incom—
ing members of the council," be con.
tinucd. “The organization can remain
just as it isiat a standstill; go ior.
ward, or it can be called oii entirely.
i do not favor the first alternative,"
Duncan declared, “and ii the second

tually accomplishing something
is impossible, then i shall do my best,
to see that the entire affair is aban.
cloned."

Duncan outlined briefly some of the
plans oi the new council. Included in
his program were a reformed account.
ing system, under which thc books oi
each organization would be examined
by the student auditor, a system of
planning and budgeting, which would
tend to eliminate the cause oi the re—
occurring financial diiiiculties oi many
campus organizations, and a reiorm in
the varsity dances in an eiiort to
make them more of social occasions.

Achievements oi old Council

An outline oi the achievements oi
the 1934-35 council, was presented by
Richard Kuncl, retiring president oi
the organization. Apportionment oi
the semester iec,,iunds tor the con—
tinuance oi varsity swimming and re—
establishment of tennis, election of a
pep queen, sponsorship oi no.date cut
dances, and representation on the fa—
culty committees were the achieve—
ments of the retiring Council’s work.

Newly.elected members oi the Stu-
dent Council, who will composc the
executive cornmittcc oi the organiza—
tion, were introduced by Kuncl, re.
tiring president. They are: Richard
Pooley and Dorothy Blandin, repre.
sentatives oi the tow students; How—
