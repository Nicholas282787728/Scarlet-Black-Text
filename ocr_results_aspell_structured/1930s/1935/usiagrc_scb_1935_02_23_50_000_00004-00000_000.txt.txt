‘ THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

FOUR

 

. SPORTS

By PAT GALLAGHER

Misery loves company. Consequently
it was very pleasant to read oi the
63.42 trimming Creighton took at the
hands of old Kentucky last night.
The total score of the Washington.
Grlnnell debacle was the third largest
in local basketball historyisd pail-ma
but what‘s that compared to the 105
that the Jays and Colonels unreeled'l
In case you’ve forgotten, Grinncll's 7s.
28 trimming administered Leander
Clark ’way back when is the Pioneer
record, while the Oklahoma Aggies 52.
43 victory over the scarlet and black
defenders in 1928 hangs in second

place.

Thesc one.innn scoring sprees
are so common nowadays that they
hardly bear mentioning. Just in
passing its worthy of note, though,
thnt the lantermjawcdl Roy Mar.
tintoni, the Washington ace, has
chalked up 21 points in EACH of
his last two gamcs. It must lie dc.
veloplug into a habit. 0n lhe oth-
er hand—he‘s not so good. Engel.
liroison counted for 22 points for
Creighton against Kentucky; and
if you want to go into :hc inattcr
right, one should *menliou dial
Edwards, the Colonels’ center, re.
Ialiaied with ihe right respectable

lutal of 34 POINTS!

Coach Truesdale reports that Julie
Bauer played only 20 out of 45 minutes
against Washington last night, In spite
of the precaution ihe coach look of
pulling him out in the first hali to
get out of a “foul mood,” Julie went
right back in the second half and fin.
ishedrlhe thing off by picking up ioul
No. 4. Bauer now ranks as the bad
man of the conference, with 32 in.
fraction: oi‘ the rules recorded in tho
score book after his name. Dobson
of the Oklahoma Aggies is second high
nasty.men with two less.

Martiutoui went to the head of the
class in conference scoring by vir.
tue of those 2x poinfs last night.
He accumulated 116 points in 12
ccnicrence games. Dick Mason ad.
vanccd to second place with a total
oi as points in 11 games. He is
lollowed by Engelbretsfm with 95,
Larson of Tulsa with 37, Cliphant
with 84, and Bauer will: 78. Mar.
tintoni loads the Volley players in
lrce throws, he‘s counted on 33
gratis tosscs. nick Mason is out
in hoot in the matter of baskets,
with 32 to his credit.

Fate must wield a heavy hand i:
Crinnell is to figure in the conference
championship now. Creighton has only
to beat Washburn and Tulsa, both sec.
ond division teams, in assure itself of
at least a tie for the title. On the oth.
or hand, Drake stands a better chance
of losing one of is two southern
games widi the Aggies and Washburn
than it does of winning both. All we
can do is cross our fingers and hope
that Creighton comes home from Dixie
in a most hedraggled condition and
that Washhurn takes advantage of are
fact; that Drake drops at least one
game down south; and that the Pie.
neers trample on Drake,

costumes, finally, were convincing.

indeed, if any fault were to he
found with the production it would be
in the occasional mispronunciations oi
words, which probably bothered no
one, however. The clumsy 14 syllable
couplets were read with skill and
meaning, and not once was prompting

Mr. 5, responsible for the play was,
after all, no Shakespeare; but one can
appropriate one of Shakespeare‘s lines
in referring to this playwright dead
now some three hundred filty years:
“Who wouid have thought the old man
