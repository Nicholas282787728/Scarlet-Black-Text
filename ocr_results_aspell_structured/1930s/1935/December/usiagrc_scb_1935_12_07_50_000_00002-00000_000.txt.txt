Count Calories

Some of the avoirdupois girls
count calories, They bring little
pamphlets to the dining room and
energetically look up everything on
the menu, use the coffee cups to
measure amounts, and mark their
pie off into inches. The idea of
eating chocolate pie with whipped
cream at 100 calories the circum—
ference inch is unthinkableiuntil
the waiter brings on the pie.

Then there are the liquid dieters
whose efforts vary from the gal
who drinks her meals from the
college fountain to the co-ed who
includes banana cream pie since.
after all .'they had to use milk
to make it,” Going the rounds is
the sad. sad story of the liquid ad-
vocate who gained five pounds dur-
ing the week she drank her mmls.
She confined her efforts to malted
milks. But the story can’t he veri-
fied.
