Clark
Rawson
Gates

Langan
Smith

Dibble added 150 more points to its
first place total in the race for the
Thompson trophy when the northend
tank men won the itramural swimming
competition last Saturday afternoon.
Eking out a‘victory over Clark by one
and half points, 36—34%, the Dibhl.
ites made in five in a row, in matter
of first places, now having taken first
in all of the intramural sports so far
played, Rawson took third in the
swimming with 25 pains, followed by
Gates and Langan, who tied for fourth
with three points each, and Smith who
finished last with half a point.

Clark won four firsts to Dibble’s
two, but the all around team strength
of the noIth.enders proved the deeid.
ing factors. The meet was close
throughout with the final outcome in
doubt until the last event, the 180.yard
medley relay. Dibble won the relay
and Rawson nosed Clark out of sec.

Trees on Grinnell College Campus
to Have Name-Plates in Near Future

Small, Metal Name-Cards
Will Identify All
53 Varieties

No longer will those uninitiated into
the secrets of botany be unable to
identify the 53 (not yet 57) varieties of
trees on the Grinnell campus, after this
spring.

The only prerequisite for the suc.
Cessl'ul tree.namer will be the ability
to road, for nameplates will soon be
attached to each of the various kinds
of trees on the campus, according to
Henry S. Cunard, professor of botany,

English Names

Nor will a knowledge of Latin be
necessary, for although such names as
"picia canadensia" and ”prnus stru.
bus" will appear on the name.cards,
the English name, the regions of which
the tree is a native, and its uses will
also be placed on the card .

Approximately 21/2 by 5 inches in
size, the metal name_cards will be
in black and white, and will be at.
tached to the trees by wires in such a
way that the bark of growing trees
will not be iniured.

53 Varieties on Campus

Among the 53 varieties of trees on

according to Professor Cunard. One
of these is the ginkgo tree, a native of
China and Japan, which is described
as a living fossil, all the rest of its
race being extinct.

Another tree native to china is the
Chinese chestnut, which was intro.
duced in this country to take the
place of the American chestnut trees
which were killed off by a Chinese
fungus.

Southern Swamp Tree

A tree which ordinarily grows only
in the swamps of the South, and is
not native of the country north of
the southern tip of lllinois, is the
Southern cypress, which is growing in
dry ground just south of Goodenow

Faculty Thespians Will Bring to Light
Unsuspected Abilities in Play Tonight

Numerous Unknown Traits
Discovered in Local

Professors

. Many unknown traits and unsuspect.
ed abilities are due w come to light
this evening when the faculty Thes.
pains exhibit their talents in the much.
discussed showing of “The. Late
Christopher Bean" is held in the
Alumni Recitation hall auditorium,
says Sarah Sherman Pryor, director of
drama.

The audience may look forward to
seeing the hitherto highly respected
Robert Norton portray a despicable,
consciencelcss forger of paintings, and
Major Herschel M. Colbert represent
“highly convincing ch shystcr" who
wangles very exhorbltant prices for
pictures with the innocent explana.
tion that "It isn’t the artists l exploit,
it’s the customers."

Holst Shricks

A fellow actor accuses Clara J. An.
dorson of being “sneaky, greedy,” and
for good measure, “stupid," and a com.
plaint is made against the “shrieking"
of the or-dinar-illy pleasingly har-mon.
ious Harald Holst. Leo P. Sherman
abandons his test tubes to act the art
connoisseur.

To get into the meat of the play,
it’s worth coming from miles around
to see the touching love scenes be.
twecn the juvenile leads, Leone Cros.
by and Chester Williams, while Grace
Hunter, Miss Crosbys Jealous 'and

 

sweethearLless elder sister writhes»
in jealousy. The dramatic piece dc
resistance is offered by Mrs. Pryor
herself, say other members of the cast,
who is guided entirely by “the will of
God." until she finally heeds the will
of Abby—the maid whom she portrays
—to bring the plot to its climax.

emeds not far in arrears of the young
men in iancying thoughts of love, the
discussion of the I-Iaggett familyi
Misses Anderson, Crosby, Hunter, and
Mr. Holstwn matters of matrimonial
concern should be entertaining, if not
enlightening. The ensuing dialogue, in.
spired by the attempt to marry off Ada
Haggetiso confirmed an old.maid that
she is beginning to forget her year of
birth with a vengeance—gives an ink.
ling of what “The Late Christopher
Bean” has to offer:

DR. HAGGET. You don't have to go
to Florida he got married.

ADA HAGGET: Maybe not, but the
opportunities there are exceptional.

DR. HAGGET: Stulf and nonsense!

MRS. HAGGET: NO it ain't, Milton!
Them Miami beaches is just alive with
boys who don’t give a thought to no.
thing but romance and getting man.
led!

DR. HAGGET: Most boys get those
ideas most any place,

versy will be revealed as the story

Charm Expert
to Come Here

Sunday, April 7

Will Give Four
Hold Conferences
With Co-eds

Lectures,

Miss Elizabeth MacDonald Osborne.
noted expert on charm, will arrive in
Grinnell April 7, and will remain here
during the following week to talk to
the women of the college and give
them conferences on their “assets and
liabilities."

While she is here Miss Osborne will
give four lectures. The first will
stress the fact that the girls’ manner of
thinking, expression, manners, voice,
posture and grooming have far more to
do with their appearance than their
clothes. Its object is to make girls
realize the importance of being pleas.
ing if they wish to mix with other
human beings.

Talks of Technical Nature

The other lectures will be more
technical to show what good grooming
consists of, how to stand and move,
and how to dress becomingly and ap.
propriately. Besides the lectures, Miss
Osborne will also hold conferences
with groups of girls and individuals.
The conferences will be arranged by
the committee in charge of Louise
Goodwin, Mary June Miller, and Rita
Phelps.

Purpose Disclosed

Miss Osborne writes, “If the colleges
are to prepare girls for living, it is
necessary that they help them learn
how to leave a pleasing impression on
those with whom they come in con.
tact. I am attempting to supply that
help by means of the week of lectures
and conferences which I present at
various colleges and universities."

Among the schools at which Miss Os-
borne has lectured are Mount Hol.
yoke, Pembroke, Radcliffe, St. Law.
renoe university, Wellesley, Middle.
.bury, Wheaten, Eelolt, Northwestern,
university, ohio Wesleyan, Purdue,
and the University of Rochester.
