, Starting with lust Wednesday's issue at the
Scarlet and Black, its editorials are by men trying
out ior next year's editorship. Their opinions may
differ irom those ot the present editorial board, in
which rose it should be remembered that the try-
ouoers are expressing attitudes which they would
have as editors of this paper, but which may not

be those at the paper under its present manage-
lnent.

OVER THE Am.

In a recent issue of the "Round Table". Beloit col-
lege newspaper, it is stated that the college radio Sta.»
tion is to be given more time on the air, thus making
it possible tor the broadcasting of dinner programs,
talks by faculty members, etc. Before this change the

service Sunday after-nouns.

1i crinnell could own and maintain a station or
this sort, even if no more than the Sunday vesper ser-
vices werc broadcast, we feel that it would benefit the
school to a great extent. Such an expense, of course,
would merit the broadcasting of the other many events
which crinnell has throughout the year but can only
be enjoyed by a few because of the size of the town and
student body. Besides the Vesper services which would
be welcomed by any listener on Sunday afternoons,
there are the daily chapel talks, the football and basket-
ball games, student recitals, glee club, orchestra and
band concerts. and several other programs which are
worthy of being sent over the air.‘

Throughout the year there are special events, such
as Norman Thumds’ lecture last Thursday evening,
Platigol’sky’s recital last January. Milsteln's appear
ance, and other outstanding programs which not only
would provide entertainment for many persons through—
out this section of the country, but would advertise
Grinnell’s high ideals and standards.

Such a station would be quite expensive, and it
would probably be argued that Grinnell is not a large
enough school to have such a station. But Beloit is a
smaller schoo‘l Grinnell; her enrollment is scarcely five-
hundred. As far as administration and other matters
are concerned, it is very much like Grinnell, It is true
that her endowment is somewhat larger, and she can
attord the expense more easily that could Grinnell.

But even with the expense of such a project, we
believe that it would be worth the time and expense
of those involved to have such a station situated at
Grinnell. At least an occasional broadcast might be
arranged through remote control by some nearby Sta»
Lion such as those of Des Moincs, AmeS, or Iowa City.
This has been done on occasions in the past, and we
should like to see it repeated. Grinnell‘s programs
should be on the air.

THE LIBRARY ON SUNDAY,

The last issue of the Scarlet and Black printed a
campus opinion concerning student views on whether or
hat the reading rooms of the library should be opened on
Sunday afternoons, This same question has been
brought up at a recent Lantern meeting. The librarian
believes that in opening the library on Sundays would
break up the present reserve bcok system by causing
these books to be returned at the beginning at the Sun-
day hour, and that it is doubtful if enough students
would take advantage or the Sunday hours to make the
opening worth while. While some students were in

that it would harm more students than it would beneﬁt.

We feel that such a system would
cause more trouble to those who would have to
be employed to maintain it than it would be worth to
the few who would take advantage of it. In the ﬁrst
place, the hours could not be very long. The doors
would have to close by Vesper time. and would not open
much before 2:00 p. m. Next, it would involve the serr
woes of one or two or possibly more members of the
library Staff who would have to break up their one day
of rest to be on their feet again rinding books for the

. station was on the air only during the college Vesper injure the present reserve book System riu’ite badly, and [ readers Third, reserve banks would have to be return-

cd for the session, or its purpose would be a failure.
This would break the reserve system, which at present
seems to be functioning very well. And lastly, we feel
that with the Six full days and ﬁve evenings that the
library is open, any ordinary student can fulfull his
reading assignments wine little difficulty,

We would suggest to those who so strongly favor a
Sunday reading period at the library that they read just
their program and conﬁne their outside readings to
times when the library is open. It is tor the good of all
and no one is inconvenienced. Gr w c.
