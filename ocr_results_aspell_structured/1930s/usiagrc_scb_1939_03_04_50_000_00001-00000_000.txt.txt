Into Western Union

Plans to investigate the possibilie
ty of having a Western Union
telegraph station in. the White
House, recreation center, were
started this week by the student
Council, campus governing body.

to students.

ern Union officials. However, they

Bullpups’ Advantage
Seen in Man Power,
And Greater Height

Grinncll's prcp cagers dropped a
37 to 25 verdict to Drake's Bull-
pups. preliminary to the varsity
game last night.

The victors had a great advanp
tags in height and man power,
while Grinnell was playing with
a squad that had been riddled with
ineligibilities.

Drake held a 20 to lo lead at
the end of the first half, made
particularly easy by Grinnell‘s loss
of Harold Kendall in the first sev~
en minutes of the game.

The preps‘ captain guard was
forced to leave the game With
four personal fouls.

Jerry Grant, playing at center-
for the Pioneers, was injured in
the second half and his loss weak-
encd the team further. Paul Pate
terson was outstanding for Grine
nell. With his 11 points from his
forward positions, he led both
teams in scoring.

Thomas and Baal were Drake's
mainstays, the former collecting

England Wants Dictatorships Involved

Russia— —Lattimore

By Gordon McCalty. :4

“This purpose explains Great
Britain‘s lukewarm attitude to-
uord China. England's political
press has considered Mancliurin
as a. kind of gangplank which
will plunge Japan into war with
the Soviet Union,” Lattimorc as—
sorted.

At Munich, the idea was the
same, Lattiinorc continued, for
England was trying to put Hitler-
in a position where war with Rus-
sia would he inevitable.

This situation would save the
Western European democracies,
and Great Britain would he nois-
ily neutral.

Lattimorc declared that Bri-
tain's plans had gone awry in
both instances. Japan and Ger-
many realize that the “Big War”
will be with Russia, but as yet

NUMBER 36

Pioneers Completely OH Game
As Bulldogs Punciure Defense
Easily to Make Many Set-ups

Scarlet and Black Sports Editor.

Des Moines last night by a

G4 to 32 score. For the Pioneers, it was their last basketball
game as members of the Missouri Valley conference, and the loss

dropped them into a tie with Tulsa university for third place with

eight victories and six defeats
apiece.
One word describes the scarlet

and blacks offense and defense
which allowed its opponents to

administer one of the most. sea
vere drllbbings in the school's his-
tory—impotent.
Si. Foot Radius.

Drake poured in approximately
as points within a six-foot radius
around the Grinnell basket:

A loose defense in the first half
gave the Bulldogs a comfortable
28 to 15 advantage. Coach Bill
Williams’ men were passing the
ball brilliantly, manoeuveiing the
defense completely out of posi-
tion, then driving in for easy set.
ups right under the basket
Fort starts Evening.

Jerry Fort got the first basket
of the evening on a long shot, and
that was the only time Grinnell
had the lead. It was apparent that
the Pioneers were off in their
shooting or the basket had a net
over it as shot after shot rolled
off the rim. Furthermore, they
weren't following their shots very
well and getting the ball off the
back board, a job that Drake was
doing consistently.

Before the second half was ten
minutes old, the Bulldogs had pot—
ted in enough tip shots and set-
ups to turn the game into a com-
plete rout with a 47 to 22 mar»
gin.

Not the Pioneers' Night.

Coach Truesdale’s men had tried
a. checking defense but it had
failed and Capt. Robert Berry had
to be carried off the floor with
torn ligaments in his knee. This
climaxed the end of their defense.

Drake's mentor proceeded to
put everyone but the water boy
into the contest. and the substi-
tutes continued to add to the
mounting score. Grinnell never
gave up, Every man fought his
heart out, but it just wasn't the
Fionecrs' night.

Ahrenkiel Loads.

The Bulldogs starting five of
Ned Swen at center, Tcky Ahrene
kiel and Paul Griffith at forwards,
and Walt O'Connor and L. D. Nor-
ris at guards all contiibuted beav-
ily to the scoring column. Ahren-
kiel led the way with nine bask-
ets.

Fred Luther and James Nash
were the only men on the Grinnell
squad that could find the basket
to any extent, and they accounted
for 13 end 11 points, respectively.
Truesdale used most of his re-
serves in the last half and of
them, George Tompkins, at center,
was particularly outstanding.
