THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

By Jack Kelsey

There seems to be some doubtas
to giving the membcrs of the fresh-
man basketball Squad numeral Sweab
era. but after watching them play last
night we believe that they deserve
some incenuve to become future Pio-
neer stars. There has always been the
talk of'winning for dear old "Po-
dunk,” but along with this there has
always come the pride of wearing a
sweater with a letter on it after the
season is over. It seems that after
serving as cannon-fodder for the var-
sity all season, that the least the
freshmen cagcrs could expect would
be numeral sweaters. The freshman
class votcd several months ago to
award the sweaters, but since that
time nothing has been done to further
the plans.

G7

Captain Hank Duncan and Dick
Ullricli wound up their cage ca-
reeis for Grimlell iii a royal mun»
her last nigltt, joining forces to ace
coinit for 19 points. Hank managed
to put his left arm into the best of
working order, and sank two ring-
ers by his favorite method, while
Ullrich plunked in a couple of long
ones. Although the basketball scar
son is completed for this season, we
.lﬁll have the opportiniity of see~
practically the same team in action
next season, for Duncan and Ull—
ricli iiill be the only ones lost to
the squad by graduation. Snuti,
Mason, Marnie, McMillin, Phelps,
Morgan, Collison, in addition to
members of the freslunan squad,
will be av name for neat year, so
that possibilities for a winning
team loom as quite possible.

Already mythical basketball teams
are being selected by sports writers
all over the country and, although we
do not believe in the practice, it ivill
at least be interesting to note the 59:
lections of other sports writers.

The first of the all~Mis§ouri val—
ley selections comes from Creigh-
ton university, avliose sports editor
for some reason or other places two
Creighton men on his teams, nun-
can is given a place on the second
team, and the fouoiving statement
is written about him

“Playing on a ive team which
won only three games in the entire
season, Duncan, oi Grime“, was a
diamond in the rouglh Had he been
a member of the Creighton or Bub
ler squads, he would have won hon»
ors on the first team. He is a line
player. Duncan was just about the
.whole show for Grinllell Saturday
night." It seems to us to be quite
a tribute from a foreign school.

Although the Crinnell track team
has been rather unsuccessful so far
this season, it seems quite probable
that they will be one of the strong-
est teams when they meet Iowa, Iowa
State, and Drake in a quadrangular
meet next week. Now that the has-
ketball season is completed Bill Par-
zybok and Dick Mason will stop
teams from scoring slams in the pole-
vault, and Bob Morgan will help Rose
in the shot put. If our line of reason-
ing is correct, it, seems that all of
the first places that the squad has
won this season, can be repeated in
a meet against the other three
schools, and with four first places ale
most cinched, it wouldn't be a bit
surprising if Grinnell would come
very close to winning the meet. In
other words individual stars may win
for Grinnell.

Interest in 1933
Dance Contest
Creater--Crosby

A change has been made in the
hour of the dancing meet to be held
Thursday, March 9, from 7:45 to
3:15 pm. At this time, the intrar
mural dance teams from the six cot—
tages will present natural, clog. and
character dances,

Approximately 150 women are en-
tered in the contest this year. Ac-
cording to Leone Crosby, director of
the meet, this number is considerably
larger than the total of last year's
entry list.

“The enthusiasm of the girls is the

, remarkable thing about this year's
Contest,” said Miss Crosby. It is at
an extremely high pitch. Those girls
who are not participating in the
dances are making the costumes, and
there am very few not connected in
some way with the meet.”

LeRoy Figland was taken to the
Community hospital Tuesday for the
treatment of tonsilitis.

Sunday Club to
Send Delegates

to Conferencel ..

According to Dave Sing-or, prosi
dent of the Sunday Evening club,
Anne Mitchell and Virginia War-low
will represent the club at a regional
conference of international relations
groups who will meet at William
Jewell college, Liberty, Missouri, next
Friday and Saturday.

A debate on the question, “Resolv-
ed that the various nations should
canccl all inter-governmental war
debts and reparations," will feature
the meeting of the club in the Assoc-
ililLionS' building at 7:30 pm. tomor-
row,

l-lugli Wyckoff and Robert Pola—
chek of the men's varsity debate
squad will debate affirmatively and
the negative side of the issue will be
handled by Helen Cleland and Eleanor
Weeks of the women's debate team.

The debate will be followed by an
open forum.

The club recently l'eccwed five
books from the Carnegie endowment
for International Peace, an organizer
tion that sponsors international l'er
lotions in colleges throughout the
country. Ten such books have been
received from this institute to date.

Monday
Edward D a ne
forth presented
to the student
body the com
vsti-uctive argu—
l ‘ incnts for the
l , presentation of
Pionecr Prudities
this year.
citing the facts that the project
was unanimously accepted at th doiu
mitories and likewi, ‘ejected at the
quadrangles, Daiiford suggested that
there was yet time and enthusiasm
to revive the Pl'udities this semester,
and to allow it to fail this year would
be to allow another Gl'lllnell trodition
to fall into discard.

Tuesday
George 0 Seiver, as, ’stant profes-
sor of French, sketched briefly the
life and essays of the French essay-

ist, Michocl Montaigne.
Living in the time of the French

as a, magistrate to write on every
subject, “with a wealth of different
styles."

He wrote about himself because he
knew himself better and because he
believed that every man carried with.
in himself the mold of the human
race . . . , Montaigne made the dis-
covery of man as an individual, and
ltherefore takes his place as the spirit
‘of the renaissance.”

Wednesday

by Brahms.

fessor in zoology, informally discuss-
ed the ways and means of passing

pretend you are in Europe,” advised
Miss Blagg, suggesting that one

knife from the first rudc spears and
shears up through the bowie and bar-

HEN smokers keep buying the
same cigarette day after day. . .

it’s a pretty good

getting what they want .

Sign that they’re
mildness,

better taste—a smoke that’s always

the same.

So we’re going

right on making

Chesterﬁelds just as we always have ‘
. . . selecting choice. ripe tobaccos

. . . ageing them

. . . blending and

cross-blending them. . .nlaking them
into Cigarettes in the most scientiﬁc
ways that are known.

As long as we do these things we
know that smokers will continue to
say,‘ ‘They Satisfy”. For that’s what
people are saying about Chesterﬁelds.

If you smoke,

why not find out

about them? A package or two will
iell you the Whole story.

THEY’RE MILDER —

THEY TASTE BETTER
