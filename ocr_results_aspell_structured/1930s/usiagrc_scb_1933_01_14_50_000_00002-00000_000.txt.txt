SINK 0R SWIM

Grinnell’s three day reading period next week
has been the subject of news stories and editorials
in The Scarlet and Black for some time. Its value
has been discussed pro and con. There is really
not much more to be said about it until after exam—
inations when records made by students will at-
test to the success or failure of the experiment.

However. there is one factor which Should
be emphasized. Grinnell college is doing all within
its power to help students prepare for their comA
prellcnsive examinations. Quiet hours will be en-
forced, social hours will be cut short, and general
conditions will be as favorable as possible for
comprehensive studying. Many colleges and unir
versities, on tile other hand, adopt tlle attitude
that students in attendance may “sink or swim”
according to their own desires, and the institu-
tions do nothing to aid review for examinations.

Inasmuch as Grinncll is attempting to aid its
students, these students have a double responsibilr
ity for seeing that they make an honest attempt
to reciprocate and be on the job Monday, Tuesday
and \Vednesday.

_G,
LET’S STOP IT

Dean Beatty has called attention to a rule
made two years ago, which if enforced by house
mothers and house presidents, would probably help
to eliminate a great deal of petty tllievcry which
has been bothering dormitory residents for some
time.

By this rule, all agents, old clothes buyer .
are barred from the upper floors of the various

_buildings. They may, if given permission by the

house mother or president, make use of the first
floor club rooms, but only if a student is present.

Having no proof one way or the other—we
have no right to even imply that the lax attitude
taken toward enforcing this rule has resulted in
the student losses. In the first place, not enough
agents come on the Grinnell campus to do it all.

But we do bclicve that something should he
done at once to stop these theftsiby eliminating
as many possibilities as possible.

Enforccwent of this rule would he one,

Keeping student rooms locked with the keys
pocketedirather than cached above the doorsi
would be another.

Stiff punishment to students caught with stolen
goods in their possession would be still another.

_G,
WHO SAID BACKWARD‘?

”Domestic bond market relatively good. Share
market healthy. Building and construction active.
Steady commodity prices. Industrial advancement
continues. Railwaysrexcepting in Manchuria oper-
ating rcgularly. Residential and office space full,
Real estate on \lp»trelld. Surplus of capital; ili~
dustrial loans preferred Chinese tonnage for 1932
ahead of previous year. Few business failur N0
BANK FAILURES.” says the last commercial rcA
port from Shanghai.

You can’t say of a nation, “backward” when
it is shrewd enough to capitalize on foreign ag-
gression and make itself p1'ospcrous.,Tllat is what
China is doing today. Purchases made by Japanese,
British, American, and other gorrisons in China
are swelling her invisible exports. These armed
forces are enhancing China’s pro. erity more rap-
idly than the exploitel's that they protect can suck
wealth from her boundaric

Another factor contributing to Chinese pros-
perity is their courage to 1" 'gc ahead with a 1mm
nanimous construction project. As in New York
City, where the obsolcnt has been surrendered to
the building of Radio City releasing a quarter of
a million dollars purchasing power, China is ac-
celerating the wheels of industry to displace the
ancient with the modern. They have had deeper
vested inhibitions to combat there which givcs us
greater cause to marvel at their advancement.

Our only question now is; “When will Grin-
nell in China. the backward nation, begin to sub-
sidize her sister school in modern, fast-moving,
progressive, America?"

Other Opinions

,»\ PAuAno ' OF GRADING
(Oberlin Review)
What courses do you feel have been the anSL worth-
while to you?

Our answer to this question would he: very often
the ones in which we have made the poorest grades.

Wth Because in these studies we have had to put up a,

hard fight to keep above “cw level. But in the end we
have slowly crept along on the path of learning toward
those who sleep in peace at the side.

But here's the paradox: we have ben‘cfitted most
from the Courses in which we are given the least recog-
nition. What kind of justice can thcre be in this educa-
tional process that dishes out its highest pay to the
most experienced of experts? Is not the very purpose of
education to improve minds, rather than to rank them?

Will the reward of lowAr-ankcd students come in
aftel‘rcollcg'c life? Dnubtles‘s, if they are not dependent
upon the collcgc recommendation:

Relief from the paradoxical grading situation will
never be attained under the ranking system, where pro-
fessors are so hound that they are unable to make any
moves toward consideration of progress and improve-
ment, and where they must give the best grades to their
majors, shoving all outsiders to the bottom of the list.
Under other methods of grading, moreover, justice in
the field of education (as justice in a capitalistic society)
will be found only in more consideration of the sting
gling under-dog by those in power.

It may be well, then, for everyone to take into con-
sideration the American ways of evaluating the worth
of undergraduates before he declares a student to be
intelligent or ignorant,

SILENT WORKERS
(Coo Cosmos)

Glaring banners, black and inflated headlines, fre-
quently chronicle the happenings of famous men or of
great adventurers. If a Lindbergh crosses the ocean
that has never been spanned before in winged flight,
the daily press acclaims him as a hero. If a Speed—king
Campbell builds a new motor and bears down the track
at Daytona beach setting a new record, the public claims
him as its very own. Achievements of great importance
and great sensationalism are cited in the press every
day. And'that is only natural and right. No doubt swim—
ming the English channel or spinning around the world
in great zepplias are noteworthy events: evmts worthy
of the attention and the admiration of the public. Them
are other events than some of the more glamorous feats
which are less sensational but just as noteworthy, There
is a great army of college workers, college instructors,
men and women in research laboratories and libraries,
educators trying to solve the problems of modern educa-
tion and modern society. It is this great body of work-
ers one hears little about. Death or retirement may re—
ceive some scant attention in the newspapers. but seldom
is it read with any appreciation of the achievement of
the individual, and his contribution to human knowledge.

One man who has contributed much to modern eduA
cation whose accomplishments have not been the kind
that merits overgrown headlines, one whose twentyAthree
years of service have been twentyrthree years of extra-
ordinary acoomplishments is "the resolute man who re—
made Harvard," A Lawrence Lowell. Followingthe disA
tinguished Charles W, Eliot, who also was a “remaker”
of Harvard, changing the college from one of “local
pride" to a great university national in scope, Lowell
committed Harvard to the “house plan.” Besides admin-
istrative changes which have been made during his m-
gime, Lowell has been the champion of academic free—
dom and has made a valiant stand for free speech. In
spite of the anti-tentonic hysteria from 1914 to 1918,
Harvard did not oust its German professor and main»
tamed a department in the study of that language when
other colleges "let their German department's and pro—
fessors quietly out.” During the “red p'cril” which dom-
inated some of our campuses in the flower of all is big—
otry, President Lowell stood by his faculty members as
cused of bolshevist leanings and in spite of the alumni
demands of the resignation of Harold Laski and Felix
Frankfurter, he retained them. President Lowell's forth—
coming retirement of course will not be an' end to his
achievements. it may be only the beginning of a career
which will have more important influences upon educa-
tion than has his active regime as president of Harvard.

This fall two men of outstanding scholarship have
finished life—tasks which they pursued to a genial old
age. still vigorous and active at. the age of 71, Dr.
William Patten of Dartmouth, famous for his extensive
research in the field of paleontology, passed away at
Hanover, N. n., last October 27 Dr. Patten had just
returned from an expedition to the Baltic, where he had
exhumed and sent home a large collection of primitive
fossils, Dr. Patten startled the world with an evolution—
ary hypothesis which traced the development of life
through the Arachnids, spider—like insects.

The predecessor of Woodrow Wilson as president of
Princeton university, Dr. Francis L, Patten, died last
November 26. Dr, Patten was an influential figure in
the academic circles of Princeton, author of several no-
table works upon Christianity, and the oldest living mod~
eretor of the Presbyterian church.

The work of all these men has been Considerable. It
has not been the kind that merits headlines. Neverthe-
less it has been of that nature which college students
should be aware of, a type they should appreciate.

PLEASE
(Wheomn News)

One of the first words we ever spoke was "please."
In those early stages when our infant strength in no
way answered egotistical desires, we quickly developed
the art of pleading. Intuitively we had guessed that
beggars can he kings, But with the unfolding of our
physical powers. we struck out for nngranted conquests.
The triar's howl was laid aside. We no longer needed to
“please."

By our fists and our teeth, we satisfied our yearn—
ingsi desires for the most part of a low material ca—
pacity. Being unimportant, we could comfortably flaunt
our independence. To no one need we, or must we, make
appeal. Slowly, however, our segregating chrysalis-
world ehippcd off. New wantsehuge wants that made
our hand power belong to pigmies—had split our please-
less fronts. We were auppliants again. The low of di-
minishing independent returns had clicked into opera—
tion, Prudent children that we were, we set about our
appeal for help. Without delay, our broadened fields of
needs took on a bonnteous richness. As little beggars,
we were profiting with 3. “please."
