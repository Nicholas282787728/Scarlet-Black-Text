CONGRATULATIONS
TEAM ON THE BEST
FOOTBALL GAME WE
EVER SAW ON
WARD FIELD

Sure—we are sorry to that you
didn’t win but we are grateful for
a fighting team that played heads
up football and gave Grinnell two
hours packed with thrills.

You will win your next game—
and you may lay to that. And
that Preston’s force will be yelling
themselves to a whisper.
