THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

(L), and .lost (R).

Dibble's undefeated speeoball
team placed five men on the 3117
dorm first team selection, picked
by the team captains, referees,
and the intramural manager in
conjunction with the Scarlet and
Black. Clark and Rawson both
placed two men on tiie team,
while Gates, Lan’gan, and Smith
each landed a single position

Hal Dean and Ed Harvey were
named for the third consecutive
time, while Fred Weatherson land-
ed an all-star berth for the second
year.

AILArounr] Player

Dean was chosen for his allr
around playing, and especially his
passing ability. Appleqllist and
Harvey, forwards, were picked be-
cause of both offensive and de-
fensive ability. The ends, \Veathr

 

erson and LaMasncy, were cute
standing scorers especially adept
at receiving passes,

stuart, fullback, and Berry and
Robb, guards, were selected on
both their ability to block kicks
and break up passes. Nelson,
goalie, displayed skill in stopping
potential field goals. DcWind,
utility man, served his team in
several positions, having played on
both the front and back lines.

Clark placed three men on the
second team; Smith, Langan, Raw-
son, and Dibble each two, and
Gates one.

Dibble led the league in scoring,
garnering 52 points, Rawson folr
lowed closely with 50, Clark was
third with 31, Langan fourth with
23, and Smith and Gates trailed
with 19 and 12 points respective»
ly. While Dibble's forward wall
was scoring points, its line of de-
fense was also active, allowing
but 14 points to be scored against
them. Clark allowed its oppo-
nents 22 points, Rawson 27, Smith

30, Langan 41 and Gates 53.

Preps Beat

(Continued from page 1)

The play of the varsity team
was marked by excellent blocking
and fair tackling, and also a
complete inability to gain against
the freshmen at the critical
points. Although the varsity out-
gained the fresh from scrimmage,
lthe reserves were completely un-
able to advance when they got
within striking distance of the
goal.

Failed to Aid Passer

Probably the score might have
been a little different if the var-
sity team had been able to con-
nect with more passes, but the
blocking, excellent for the most
part in the line, was far below
par when protection for the pass-
er was needed.

Homann, Wallace and Willard
White looked the best in the var-
sity backfield, while Ewart and
Baichly were the line Stars.

We all agree on this .

cigarette

paper is important. For Chesterﬁeld

we use the best paper that we can
buy. It is called Champagne Ciga-
rette Paper. It is made from the soft,
silky ﬁbre of the ﬂax plant. It is

washed over and over

A lot of the pleasure you get in

smoking Chesterﬁelds

is due to our

using the right kind of cigarette pa-
per. Chesterﬁeld paper is pure, and

it bums without taste

 

or odor.

 

Remember this . . . two things make the
smoking quality of a cigarette— the tobacco; and the

paper. The Champagne

cigarette Paper on Chester-

ﬁelds is tested over and over for purity, for the right
burning quality. Another reason Why Chesterﬁeld Wins.
