WOMEN IN POLITICS

Citizens, not only of Iona but of every state, should be
concerned about the bill recently introduced ill tlle Iowa legs
islzlture which would prevent many women from entering
the political field.

Tlle provisions ol,‘ the bill are in part: “No married per—
son shall be employed in the service of the state or any poll-
tical subdivision thereof who has a husband or wife regular-
ly employed at a salary of more than $1,500 a year plus
S 50 for each dependent child, or whose income, tog-ether
ulth that of said husband or wife is $2,000 plus $250 for
each dependent child. This act shall not apply to charitable
and penal institutions or married persons employed thereln."

While such a bill it passed would probably accomplish
its purpose of taking married women out of governmental
positions it is questionable whether such action would be a
good thing. Women holding minor clerkships might be dlSs
pensed with, but we have seen too many women render dis-
tinguished service in government to believe that they should
be prevented from serving.

In this connection one can thinlc of a number of women
holding important offices in the federal government: Fran-
ces Perkins, secretary of labor Miss Josephine Roche, assi
tant secretary of the treasury; Miss Louise Stanley, chief
of the bureau of home economics of the department of agil—
culture; Mary Anderson and Katherine Lenroot, of the de-
partment of labor; and Rep. Edith Nourse Rogers of Massa—
chllsetts.

Surely brilliant, public spirited women who have raised
their families and wish to solve in government positions
should be encouraged and not legislated agains They are
by nature better fitted than men to cope with tle great ‘07
cial problems which confront us. Democracy is richer '
the work women have done, and it is to be hoped that they
will continue to have the opportunity to serve. S
