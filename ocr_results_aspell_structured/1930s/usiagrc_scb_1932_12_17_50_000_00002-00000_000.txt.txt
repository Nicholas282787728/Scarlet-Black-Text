TRADITION WORTH WHILE

Many of our Juniors and Sell-
iors can often he hczlrd bemoanng
the decline of tradition ill Grill-
nell s Hell \Veek abolished 7

so on without end.

They lose sight of a very illi-
portltnt tradition ,which has not
declined.

Last night, approximately 50
lloys, members of thc Uncle Sam’s
club, were entertained by Gl-illr
llell men, at the club’s annual
Christmas dinner, given in the
men’s dining room, and followed
by an entertainment ill one of the
club rooms.

The party was typical of the
affairs the youngsters have collie
to expect each year.

It is not uncommon for colleg-
ions to be described as selfish and
unthinking people who spend
their time going to dances and
howling at football games. You
would have questioned the dc
Scription, had you Seen some of
these same collegialls last night.

Ill 8 year such 'as this. it would
not have been hard to forget these
youngsters and their Christmas
party. College students are havr
ing their share of worry and
trouble during the current “re-
adiustmcnt”.

It is therefore a compliment to
the thoughtfulness and consider-
ation of Grinllcll students that
they can take time out to make
the situation just a little more
happy for these kids.

RAZZING THE COEDS
(From The Daily Iohl'ml)

Back in the palmy days When coeds
required a good three-quarters of an
hour to dress—seven minums for each
petticcat and 10 minutes apiece for
corset and bustlc~condemnation of
the feminine dress may have been
justified, Just now it’s again the butt
of some rather nasty razziug. But
what at different kind of razzl 1f
miiady resented the charge of over-
fsstidiousness buck iu the meticulous
nineties. she'll probably be thorough-
ly insulted at the charge of Slovcilr
liness in the slipshotl thirties, Ye‘s,
unpleasant though it may be to con-
template. “slovenllness” is today’s
accusation.

“A blot on the campus landscape,"
was the term recently used in dec
scribing the appearance of girls at
Bryn Mawr college. “Campus vislr
tors,” according to the commenting
editorial writer. "are confronted on
all sides with intellectuals whose fin-
gcrnoils are suffering from intimate
contact with the good earth, hair re-
sembling that ’of' an East Indian af-
ter a hard day in the rice fields, and
clothes that would have brought
slums to Belgian refugees." .

Intellectualism, it seems, is blamed
for the deplorable condition of the
Bryn Mawrites. Hinting that shabbi-
ness and ~grubby fingernails have
been adopted as an intellectual pose,
the accuser suggested that such eca
centriclties in dress do not suggest
genius. but laziness and carelessness,

In a survey at a western teachers’
college, 45 per cent of 100 girls iris
spected received unsatisfactory ratr
lugs for appropriateness of clothing
and clean hands. Faces and necks of
28 per cent failed to pass muster,
shoes and hose condition of 14 per
cent fell below par, and clothes de
-ficient in cleanliness rated 25 per
cent.

We heard a mother, who is still re-
covering from a summer of daughter
atrhome-from-Vasszr, remark wearw
by that “Margie seems to have lost
all sense of neatuess since she's been
away at school. Hairpins strewing
out everywhere . . . buttons off . . .
runnered hose . . , they even wear
overalls to class."

ARE THEY DOING ANY»
THING?
(Creightoninn)

College honorarv organizations
seem to receive their severest criti-
cism from that section of the student
body which, because of poor scholl35r
tic standing or failure to participate
in extra-curricular activities, can
never hope to attain membership.
The “fox and grapes” fable is never
more applicable than in this instance,
But aside from the illogical and
usually harmless argument advanced
by this group, there is a growing in—
difference which amounts almost to
passive opposition by those who main-
tain that “honorary organizations

are not doing anything."

If this is true and if it contains
any truth, it is a serious charge.
Surely these groups do not exist for
the purpose of self-glorification. If
their purpose is mutual back-potting.
the fuculty might well give each a
medal and tell him to spread the gos-
pel of superiority.

These honorary organizations have
a more distinct obligation to leader—
ship and school service than other
college groups. They are made up of
superior students; they have the
backing of the faculty and the ma—
jority of the students; they are ex-
pected to do something.

It is therefore not at all out of on
dcr to remind new members of these
groups that tbev have obligations to
ncrforrn. Their election to member
ship was the honor: their actual
membership is a challenge.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

COURTESY
(Eroin tlic Iowa State Student)
\Vtiat is courtesy?
To some it is holding open the door
for a, lady, walking on the outside of
tbc walk, rising when an oltlcr lady
comes into the room. seating the
hostess at the table.
To others the meaning of courtesy
is more profound. It is this more pro-
found courtesy that is so generally
ignored by students and faculty on
the campus.

Have you ever attended a banquet
where some noted speaker tried des-
perately to ignore the fact that 99
per cent of his audience were toying
with a water glass, admiring the
architecture of the ceiling, or bowing
their heads in an attitude of utter
boredom?

The members of the audience may
be interested in the subject being
presented. Yet, somehow they forget
the allsimportant point—courtesy to
the speaker.

Certainly the least we can clo is
to at least appear interested, Whether
it be in the classroom, at the lecture
series, or a banquetilet us not for
get. The courtesy of attention and
interest is just as important as bold
ing the door for someone.

STICK TO YOUR OWN GAME
(The Crimson-\Vhite)

“Stick to your own game.” five
words which, when Standing separ-
ately, are almost insignificant, but
when arranged in the above order a
value that knows no bounds.

There should be a lesson for every
mar. and woman on the campus in
that sentenccia lesson that should
be carried through life always occu-
pying a foremost place in the mind.
A further development of it reveals
that you may be the best in one spe-
cialty but. just an also ran in an.
other. This does not mean that one
Should refrain from other activities.
but implies that one should not fret
about or envy another person's suc—
6655.

Everyone is proficient in some up—
dertakmg. Of course it is nice to be
before the eyes of the world with the
letters "success" written everywhere;
but not everyone can be a success in
the branches of life which are con-
stantly commanding the attebuou of
the world. The satisfaction of success
should not be in being able to have
other people laud your achievements,
but should be in knowing deep down
in your own .beart that you did your
best and succeeded in your undertak-
lug.

All of us can't be great football
players; all of us can't be great cori-
ema stars; all of us can't be great
diplomants; all of us can't be great
financiers but each and every one can
be a success in his line if he wishes.
Honors are to be had in every form
of work, whether it be large or small.
It is almost foolish to play a game
which you are not adapted to. So
study these five words, analyze tbem,
apply them to your own life, play the
game the best that you can and in
due time you will receive your amrd,
_ ~D. G.

ground that it
develops social cbcrsctcristics such
as manhood, sportsmanship, coopera-

Not only does organized athletics

focuses the attention of the great
crowds on these characteristics, cc-
cording to Mr. Truesdale.
In athletics “rugged manly indi-

of the group."
