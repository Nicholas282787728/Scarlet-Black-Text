‘Unified Control of Machine Output or
Social Downfall,’ Predict Technologists

Roger Babson Sees Return
Of Better Times Under

Present System

(Special la The scrrlcl mill Bloch)

NEW YORK, (CNsliThe product
of 12 years' study by a group of re
search engineers at Columbia uni-
versity. Technocracy. according to
its exponents, predicts either the uni-
fied control of machine production or
the complete downfall of the pres-
ent social systemiin the not very
far distant future.

At the present time, its workers
are engaged in assembling masses of
data and figures on industrial de-
velopment to prove that mach:ne
energy is replacing human effort at
an astounding rate, and while not
proposing any set plan for a social
change, they are completing several
hundred comprehensive charts to
show that the problem of machine-
made or technological unemployment
may not necessarily be disastrous.

Must Have Control

in fact they believe, according to
Technocratic reports, that it is quite
possible to correlate machine effic—
iency and the consequent decreased
demand for human labor so that

Babson, noted observer of business
conditions, who predicted the return
of normal conditions on the basis of
present methods of barter and trade.

However, skeptical comments by
industrial leaders, as well as the di-
rect attacks, did not keep thousands
from looking wit hope on Technoe
cracy's roseate hints of a new social
structure, which, it is maintained,
must be evolved to forestall a com-
p=cte economic collapse.

Those hopes were based on such
possibilities—if not predictions—of
an eightrllour week for workers. of
a scrapped price and debt system,
with a substitute currency based onl
energy units instead of on a single
commodity, of a high standard of live
ing to be maintained by incomes
from controlled machine energy and
of economic security for all individ~
uels in the social system.

Observers pointed to at least one
Technocratic accomplishment of
note: The public is taking perhaps a
kccner interest in economic and soc-
ial problems than ever before.

This can he accomplished, they con-
tend, by some type of control.

No recommendations as to the
exact nature of a substitute economic
structure, however; are being made,
since the Technocrats maintain
stontly that they are merely conduct-
ing a fact-finding bureau, which will
furnish specific. accurate and indica-
tive information, to be used, if the
country sees fit, as the foundation
for an intelligent system of industrial
control.

‘View with Alurm’

It was Technocrecy's facu. how-
ever, which were this week under
fire by business leaders, who were
prone to "View with alarm" the
alleged inaccuracy of some of the
figures quoted.

The attacking group was led prin-
cipally by John Van Dcvcnter, editor
of Iron Age and director of United
Business Publications, who declared
that the Columbia research group
had presented statistics, purporting
to prove the immense displacement
of human labor by machines, that
were inaccurate and exaggerated.

Based on such statistics, he said,
the Technocrats have created a fear
of the machine which is both un»
warranted and harmful to the forces
of recovery.

By Dean Albert E. Bailey

INDIANAPOLIS, TND.-—~When 40
out of every 100 marriages in Indiana
apolis have to be annulled. something
is wrong with marriage.

Not Matter of Sentiment

The new course in marriage rela-
tions at Butler university purposes
to find out what is wrong, to bring
to light causes of marital unhappy
ncss so persons who enter the mare
riage relation may do so intelligent-
ly and those who are already mar-
ried may find their way to success
and happiness.

Happiness in marriage is not a
matter of sentiment; it is a matter of
knowledge, ideals and ethical con»
trol.

studies made by psychologists and
social workers, and the revelations of
many a pastor's confessional all point
to ignorance and selfishness as the
root causes of trouble.

social Talioos

To dispel ignorance instructors in
this Butler course in marriapc icia-
tions will present facts that bear on
all the major aspects of married lik
mph sical, temperamental, economic,
sp ual.

The physical aspects of marriage
heretofore have not been the subject
of intelligent exposition.

A coinpiracy of silcnce on the part
of those who know, coupled with so—
cial taboos on the part of Lhose who
would like to know, have left the dis-
semination of knowledge to the in-
competent.

No wonder man and woman ape
proach marriage with abysmal ignor-
ance or perilous misinformation.

it takes so little knowledge and
so little good will to tum a source
of danger into a spiritual asset.

This most important phase of mars

diana school of medicine and an
author of note on public health, eu-
genics and sex education.

culties rests on a respect for person—
al differentiation, a recognition of
danger zones, elimination of emotion»
al tensions, provision for legitimate
outlets for desire and the suppression
of the will to power in favor of mu-
tual self»fulfi11ment.

These aspects will be expounded
by Dr. Mary H. Young, director of
the Harman Young Foundation and
more or of clinical psychology in

J. L. Rosenstein of ‘the clinical psy-
chology department, Butler llanOYSlr

The spiritual and ideal aspects will
be treated by Dr. Francis Wicks,
pastor of All Soul’s Unitarian church,

The social, economical and legal_
aspects will be given by Charles
Mctxgcr, professor of sociology in
Butler university. Not only has Mr.
Metzger devoted years to social and
economic problems but in his private
practice as attorney he has been ref—
eree in more than a thousand divorce
cases.

Dovotc All Resources

out of such a study ought to re-
sult a higher ideal of married life
and a resolve on the part of everya
one to devote all his resources of
knowledge, determination and artisc
try to the successful consummation
of this personal pl‘ollIem,

We hope that other universities
will follow the example and establish
a permanent course on marriage for
all senior and graduate students,
