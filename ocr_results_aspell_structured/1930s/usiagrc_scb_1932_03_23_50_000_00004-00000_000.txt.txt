spoke in commemoration of the one-
hundredth anniversary of Goethe’s
death, He described him as having
“the most spacious mind since Aris-
totle," and declared him worthy of
comparison with the great trio,
Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare.
“Like Leonardo da Vinci, he was a
man of remarkahle versatility, not on-
ly in his great achievements in the
field of literature, among which are
included the creation of the modern
German lyricg the psychological novel
and the historical drama. but also in;
.his outstanding work as statesman!
‘and scientist.
“One of Goethe's most striking
characteristics was his restless active
ity. He was also deeply religious. al-
tho he had little sympathy for the
ecclesiastical expressions of Christ»
iauity in his time and loved to call
himself a pagan," President Nollen
said. “He believed in immortality as
a reward of merit and work. The
most characteristic quotation from
his works is the song of the angels
bearing Faust up to heaven. Roughly

The Grinncll mile-relay quartet
seems determined to go places this
year, having run its last two races in
fast time even for an outdoor per—
formance. The Pioneers feat of
breaking the fieldhouse record in the
quadrangular meet is all the more
spectacular in view of the fact that
the old record was held hy a team on
which George Baird and Babs Cuhel,
former Hawkcyc Olympic stars. ran.
Baird held the Big Ten conference
record in the dad-yard dash until
Russell of Michigan cracked it last
week,

heels iiud his time was about 4:24,
while Pfeiﬂ'cr traveled the distance in
about 4:25. T11’ is the fastest that
either of the Pioneer distance men
have ever run the mile.

The Grinnell team demonstrated the
fact that its strength is concentrated,

day. The Pioneers will probably send
the mile relay team and a distance
medley relay unit to one of the meets.
There is no individual twoeiiiile run
scheduled at either piece so Pilbrow

other than as the distance man with
the medley relay outfit.
