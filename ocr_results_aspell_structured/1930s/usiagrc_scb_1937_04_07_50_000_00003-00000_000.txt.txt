According to Mr. Thomas, the
second annual trip showed that
modern employers judge their pro-
spective employees along the fol-
lowing lines: mental ability, as in~
dicated by the applicant's scholas-
tic record; leadership, as shown by

the average salary offered to men

An independent survey was made recently

doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who
said they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated
they personally prefer a light smoke.
