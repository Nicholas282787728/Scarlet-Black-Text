ATLANTIC CHARGES PARTIALITY
Under the classiﬁcation of “Local News
* Briefs” on page ﬁve of the Nov. 17 edition of the
Atlantic News-Telegraph, a daily newspaper prints
ed at Atlantic, 1a., the following story pertaining
to the return of the Atlantic lligll school delegation
from the convention of the Iowa College Press as-

sociation at Griuncll college Nov. 14-15 appeared:
Home From Electing—Mrs. Grace Busse,

journalism instructor in the Atlantic high school,
Jessie Marshall, Elinor Brown, Royce Childs, Barb-
M‘s. Busse, William Nichols, June Stamp, Vale
Thompson, Raymond Joyce, and Mary Virginia
Allen of the journalism class have retumed home
{mm the meeting of the Iowa High School Press
association at Grlnnéll Friday and Saturday.

The meeting ended in ﬁreworks, many schools
withdrawing following the announcement of the
annual press awards, charging the association
favored schools in which Grinnell alumni We're
instructors, Atlantic, which usually places high in
the events with its high school publication, “The
Needle," failed to Win but did not withdraw from
the prep press sssocistiun,

The three charges made by the Atlantic paper,
(I) the meeting ended in fireworks, (2) many
schools withdrew following the announcement of
the annual press awards, and (3) the association
favored schools in which Grillncll alumni were ill-
structors, are untrue. All of the 276 delegates from
the 43 Iowa high schools who were in attendance
at the meeting Will admit that the criticism is
erroneous and based on misinformation.

The convention at Gl-inncll last month was the
eleventh annual meeting and the largest ill the
history of the association. chcral delegates left
before the awarding of the prizes Saturday morning
in order to get to Iowa City ill time to see the Iowa
Homecoming football game with Penn State. Surely
their dc arturc would not be the basis for the three
accusations made ill the above story.

The ”Needle,” newspaper of the Atlantic high
school, did not rec ivc recognition this year either
in the awarding of p '22s or naming of honorable
mention publications. The two contests ill which
the paper was entered, front page makeup and .all-
around, were judged by four journalists, two of
thcm visiting speakers at the convention and the
othc managing editors of Grinucll newspapers.
Partlality to papers of S 10015 in which Grillncll
alumni wcrc instructors was not thought of by the
judges or anybody else until the NewsrTclcgrapll
account was read.

An investigation of the Atlantic paper’s
charges by Herschcl M. Colbert, director of the
journalism department at Grinnell and Secretary
of the Iowa High School Press association, showed
that two of the eight awards happened to be made
to Iowa high schools ill which Grinncll alumni wcrc
instructors. The two werc Greenﬁeld, which won the
front page makeup and when; Miss Vivian Fallsllcr
is an instructor, and Fort Dodge, which was award-
ed the cups in the llllmor column and magazine
division and where Miss Mary Cruikshank is all
instructor. Council Bluffs, Cedar Rapids, Newton,
and Mcrshalltown, which won two prizes, replied
that none of their present faculty has been con«
nectcd with Grinncll in any way.

A criticism as serious and dangerous as the
one made by the Atlantic NcWSvTclcgrapll should
be taken as an example of unethical and poor
journalism. Any paper that deals in misinfor-
mation is sure to ”be found out” by its
readers, and suffer a loss of valuable public con-
ﬁdence.

The charges made in the reprint above are
untrue and consequently libelous. Au apology,

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

either by letter or in prll for thc untrutllful
mil in would partly help to make amends for
tho serious error.

THAT THRILLING CHARITY GAME

Drakc and Grinucll alumni football stars who
met Saturday in a charity game at Dcs Moincs
Surprised authorities, Students, and other fans by
displaying some phenomenal football. The primary
purpose, to obtain funds for charity, was somewhat
set aside and replaced by a real treat [or every
loyal admircr who overlooked tllc weather and went
to the game.

Like the regular Drake-Grillucll cllcoulltcrs,
friendliness prevailed throughout, on the field and
among the spectators. Former Conch “Mikc” I'Iyr
land was permitted to go ill and try for the extra
point after the touchdown, substituting was frcr
qucllt, and every contestant played hard, clean
football. Feature playing characterized the entire
game, and the average onlookcr thought it the
best of the year. °

McLain, ’26, kicked a ’70 yard punt, which is
seldom sccn at any football game. The Pioneers
completed two consecutive passes for tllc one touch-
down of the the game. Grinncll’s lillc functioned
well on defense, and allowed the famous Drake star
brill totcrs few gains.

Ardent admirers cllccrcd their favorite stars
of former years, not merely because they played
good football, but because the zilulluli gladly drop-
pcd their work for the love of the alma mater and
the desire to help charity. Fortunately llo illjul' s
occurrcd, contrary to expectation when men are
not in condition.

Another unemployment Situation demanding
a Similar game is not wanted, but everyone would
enjoy seeing Drake and Grillncll alumni meet again
on the football ﬁeld.

BULL SESSIONS VS. STUDYING .

Bull sessions are fast taking tllc place of study-
ing. The time formerly spent in preparing for next
day‘s lessons is now being taken up by these in
formal discussion groups. Those wishing to study
are prevented from doing So by tho noisc luadc by
those wllo do not, and those who should be study-
ing, but are weak in the will to get started, hear
the shouts and laughter and drop their books glad-
ly. Ill fact the average student argues that there
is no use trying to study through the din and, lay-
illg his books aside, goes and joins the fun.

And, besides detracting from studies, bull scs»
sions are often had moral influence. One gets the
idea, from what he hears there, that cullcgc life
is embedded in ﬁlth. A freshman might get the idea
that all upper classmcn arc dcgcneratcs. Tllc disr
cussioll usually swings around to the wrong side,
not by intention, bilt just naturally.

The bull session habit is mentally and morally
bad for the school. It should be seriously thought
about with an idea toward doing something about
it. It is really a problem and not it jokc.

Perhaps if the student would do a little think-
ing about bull sessions, too, it would go a long way
toward solving the problem—J. S.

POLITICAL AUTONOMY IN INDIA

The great activity of India in seeking political
autonomy has been fal'rreaching. It would seem
that its people were wholeheartedly back of the
Indian government ill such attempts.

At tllc college conference of Young Mcns‘
Christian associations from nine lniddlewcstcru
states, held at Lake Geneva, Wis, last June, a num-
ber of Indians, students in American institutions,
were present. These foreigners conducted chcnal
roulldtahlc discussions, meetings which were pop-
ularly attended.

The sincerity and the great vigor with which
the leaders propounded their cause was cvidcnt to
all the delegates. Eacll Indian sought to claim the
floor for the entire roundtable meeting.

There was one mall among the listeners, a
citizen of Czccllo-Slovakia,,who exposed a glaring
weakness in the speakers’ plan for a new India. He
brought out the fact that the Indians had no prac-
tical ideas of national ﬁnance. Tllcy declared that
they would not need the loans of other nations,
bccausc they had money ill their own country.

The nine representatives practically admitted
that Indian credit would not be accepted by for-
clgll nations. Consequently any plan for political
autonomy ill Ilftlia must be practical as well as

just.

WANTED: MEDIOCRE SWIMIVLERS!

A Grinncll man often says that he does not
want to go out for varsity athletics because he docs
not have a cllallcc to make tllc tcaln. What if you
don't make the team! Nothing hurts the sports
program of a school more than the smallness of
squads.

Swimming is one of the sports that now needs
men. There are good opportunities for making the
team, but there are many more reasons why medio-
cre swimmers should come out.

Swimming happens to be one of the college
sports that can be of the greatest pleasure all
through life. It is a Sport that can be enjoyed even
if all accident cuts off all arm or log. Why not take
the opportunity given by the college to turn nlcrlioe
ere swimming ability into a beautiful swimming
stylc'.I

Swimming is one of the most healthful excr-
ciscs known. Every muscle of the body works, the
lungs are developed, and the whole body is tuned
up.

Come on men, lets give Coach Elton A. Roscll
a big squad!
