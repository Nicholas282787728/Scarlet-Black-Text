Trio Debates
South Dakota

on Advertising

for Grinnell.

Advertiser Defined

Visitors Shy Advertising Lowers
Distribution Cost, Making

More Production.

“A successful advertiser should be
a psycologist, a sociologist, an
economist, a business manager, and
a scientis ,' said a member of the
Grinnell affirmative team in a de—
bate with the University of South
Dakota upon advertising Thursday
night in the Alumni Recitation hall
auditorium.

The debate was a non-decision one,
and the first that Gl-innell has ever
participated in with South Dakota,
The Crinnell affirmative team Cone
sisted of John shoddy, Jonathan
Danforth. and Edward Spencer.
South Dakota]: trio was Marion Nel—
son, Ralph Rice, and otto Gruen.
Francis Hawk acted as chairman. _

The statement of the question

s “Resolvedr'that the advertising
of commodities as practiced in the
United States today by manufac-
turers, wholesalers, and _dealers is
more harmful than beneficial to
society."

Ads Expensive.

"Advertising lacks business or—
ganization," was the first construc—
tive point of the Crinnell affirmative
team. “It is unprofessional, lacking
standards. It is unscrupulous, em-
ploying much exaggeration." Ad—
vertising is becoming a great ex—
pense, and it is the small man,
whether consumer or producer, who
has to hear this expense, they 35‘
serted. It is going in the wrong
direction: getting a “black eye.”

“If the public bites, they are sucks
ers, but we must protect them from
biting," said Edward Spencer. Ad-
vertising brings commercialism, it
disrupts standards through appealing
to fear, envy, pride, and suggestion,
and it brings about unfortunate
economic effects.

The South Dakota negative team
pointed out that advertising lowers
the cost of the product to the cou-
sumer, The cost of distribution is
lowered; mass production, is made

« possible. The product is made fa-
miliar to a much greater territory.
Even the time of the clerks is saved.

Brings Knowledge. ‘

In economic value, seasonal fluc-

tuations may be overcome by in-
creasing dcmands at certain times.
Unemployment may be remedied by
making the demand equal the sup-
ply through advertising.
. From a social point of view, ad-
vertising brings knowledge: it edu-
cates. Without advertising, ‘ the
modern newspaper and magazine
would not be possible to buy at
such a low price.

The Grinneil women's debate team
will meet the co-ed trio of the Uni-
versity of Iowa here on Monday
night, March 24. On Wednesday
night, March 26, the Grinnell men’s
negative team upon the advertising
question, which is composed of Rob-
ert Blasier, Richard Phillips and
Francis Hawk, will meet the nega—
tive advertising team of the Univer—
sity of Iowa here:

Tyler Gives Talk
on ‘Press Agents:

”‘Press agents today are men
who have made a ﬂap of the newsc
paper profession,’ according to Clark
McAdams, editor of the editorial
page of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,
in his address delivered at the na-
tional convention of Sigma Delta
Chi last fall," said Edward Tyler,
business manager of The Malteaser,
in talking on “Press Agents" at the
meeting of Crinuell Sigma Delta

~ Chi Thursday noon,

“Carl Bickel, president of The
United Press, said at the convention,
‘The wrong kind of press agents
could be eliminated if newspapers
and press associations would hire
well-trained men, who know‘ bunk
from truth, and if graduates of the
schools of journalism would go into
the press agent ﬁeld," stated Tyler.

On an average, wages of press
agents today are more than those of
newspaper men.

It is not easy to review the Pioneer

without growing superlatively en-

costumes, the settings and above all,
the acting were nothing less than
remarkable.

Building Three
Wins'Ball Game
“ From Dibble Hall

One run in the last half of the last
inning gave Kelly Stables the jump
on Dibble this morning in the sec-
ond game of the intramural baseball
season. The ﬁnal score of the game
was s to 5. In the ﬁrst game, Clark
swamped an unorganized Smith hall
team‘by a score of 27 to 3.

Kelly Stables took an early lead
and raised it to four runs by the
fourth inning. Dibble then cut down
the lead by taking three scores in
the fourth, with Kelly getting one
in the ﬁfth. Two runs for Dibble in
the last half of the sixth tied the
score at ﬁve-all. After much argu-
ing over the rules, Kelly pushed
over a run in the first half of the
seventh, and held their opponents to
a scoreless inning to win, Wilhelm
pitched the game for Dibble and
Ruff for Kelly Stables.

Arent, pitching for Clark, showed
good speed and control to help his
team to easy victory over Smith.
His five strike outs were matched
with thre'e of Risser‘s who pitched
for Smith. Smith showed strength
only in the first inning making two
of its runs in that frame.

Three games are scheduled for
next Saturday, Building Four and
Three will play at two o'clock, Dibble
will meet Smith at three and_Clark
scraps with Langan at four.

By BETTY COOK,

"The trend in the field of debating
is toward non-decision debates,"
Prof. D. C. Dickey, debate coach at
the University of South Dakota, said
Thursday evening. “In South Del-
kota we try not to do away with de-
cisions entirely; perhaps two—thirds
of our debates are decision debates.

“The decision is, of course, inci-
dental, although it attracts larger
audiences. The real value is in the
valuable criticism a good critic
judge can give." Mr. Dickey favor-
ed non-decision debates in so far as
they do away with the amateurish
tendency of arguing against the
“worthy opponents" rather than
sticking to the question.

Extensive Schedule

The South Dakota debate Schedr
ule for 1929 and 1930 is the most
extensive in the history of the uni-
versity. There are several teams, an
affirmative and negative, for both
the advertising question and for that
of disarmament: some Women’s de<
bate teams and several freshman
teams.

By registering in a certain speech
course, debaters may receive two
credit hours for their debate work,
and. by taking courses in argumen-
tation and debate, it is possible to
get Six hours’ credit.

A number of the debates are held
before special audiences, Mr. Dickey

that one so capable occupies a seat
in its faculty. And it would not do
to overlook those Sigma Delta Chi

after them will continue to sponsor
a project so eminently worth while,
“Noolus Lark" Finished’

Why did I award “Noah’s Lark"
first place? Because it seemed to
me to be slightly more finished than
any of the other Prudities.1t’s lines
were good, its settings novel, its
presentation o! professional caliber
And the singing was exceedingly
well done. The fact that Miss Fran-
ces Ride, a girl from my own home
town was in the-cast, did not in-
fluence me one way or the other, but
I shall tell her mother that Frances
is anything but a prude.

“Love Triumphs Over All," the old-
style melodrama, carried me back a
score of years to those days when
the, villain tapped one foot on the
stage and hissed as the hero foiled
his dastardly plot. This act was
very well done, although I overheard
a lady, who sat behind me, observe
that “it was not quite bad enough"—
whatever that might mean. This
was a clever skit, admirably acted
and very appropriately costumed.
How funny those long dresses seem-

to the costumes worn by the coeds
in some of the other acts,%h what?

Likes “Ginger Snaps"

“Ginger Snaps” was snappyeno

nimble of foot, and Clarence Cooper
in a difficult role, did exceedingly
well.1 But in these days of prohibi-

the audience might have thought
that a decision in favor of this act
would be setting a bad example for
the rising generation. Anyway, I
hesitated long between this not and
the melodrama, and finally decided
for the former with mental reserva-
tio: that ”Ginger Snaps" deserved
first honorable mention.

Selecting the winner in a case of
this kind is almost as difficult as
naming an all—state basketball team.
Many are certain to disagree with
the selector. No matter which acts
are named, one always thinks that
perhaps he should have named an-

from those who are organizing

‘Trend in Field of Debating is Toward

college Sioux City wasneld at
the First Congregational church of
that city, and the return debate was
held before an audience of Vermil—
lion Congregationalists. The Univer-
sity of Nebraska was met before the
Lincoln Advertising club, and a few
of the debates were held before high
school audiences.
College Audiences Small

The university audiences at de—
bates are not large audiences, the
coach said, but considering the size
of the school they are satisfactory.

Between a thousand and eleven
hundred students are enrolled at
South Dakota, with practically fifty
per cent of them members of social
fraternities and sororities. In com»
menting upon the absence of such
organizations in Crinnell, Mr. Dickey
said, "Schools that don't have frater—
nities and sororities are probably
just as well off without them, al-
though we who have them can see
just about as many advantages as
disadvantages."

South Dakota has nothing in the
line of chapel services and has on-
ly a vague form of student govern-
ment with few powers. So vague is
the organization that the instructor,
a member of the faculty, knew noth»
ing about it.

There are schools of law, engin—
eering, music, arts and sciences at
the university in addition to a good
pre-medical ourse.

Thursday, 26-2.

The Smith hall mermen clinched
-t.l-le intramural water polo clip here
Thursday by finishing the season
without a defeat when they trounced
Langan hall, 26 to 2. The battle for
second place is still in the open field
since Clark and Dibble have each
won two games but have not com~
pleted their schedules. Langan and
Building Four will contest the fourth
place right while Kelly appears to
be certain of the cellar position.

Danforth was the outstanding man
for Smith in the final'game, with his
repeated attacks on the Langan
goal. His playing in the final game
stamped him as one of the best for-
wards in school. Scott, Taylor, Ad-
ams and Grounds were invaluable
men on the Smith offensive while
Bisser, Norton and Lambie counted
on the defense.

Pojman put up a fine defense and
made several futile attempts to score
for Langan while Bilto, Edman.
Fabian, Troyer and Rumsey worked
well on the defense. Smith scored
two goals in the first half and Lao
gap was held to a pair of gift Losses.
In the second half the winners piled
up 16 more points while Building

SOUTH BEND, IND. — Although
forcing the issue in every race, the
track representatives of Grinnell

to qualify in the time trials of the
Central Intercollegiate track meet

Notre Dame university Friday and
Saturday.

With half of his squad elb-ninated
in the events Friday, Coach G. Les-
ter Duke of the Iowa tracksters is
counting upon points for the Pio-
neers in the mile relay, Benny
Hensley in the hurdles and Howard
Mellratb in the mile run Saturday.
Hensley represented the Grinnellians
in meets last year with Warner
Taylor, crack hurdler and dash man
and brother _of the 1924 Olympics
champion, Morgan Taylor.

More than 215 star track perform-
ers of middlewest institutions were
at the field house Friday clicking off
the trial races. The local squad of
Notre Dame athletes loomed as prob-
able winners of the two-day contest.
Competition for places in several of
the dashes was keen due .to the pres-
ence of runners of Olympic fame.
Marquette university of Milwaukee
and Notre Dame copped points
through the performance of their
Olympic representatives.

which Murphy led until the last half
lap. Taking the outside lane, he set
the pace until near the finish when
Jack Walter, Canadian Olympic run-
ner. now at Marquette, and Wilson,
famous half»miler
passed him. Walter took the af-
fair in 2:02, but Murphy fought his
way to the tape not far behind him.

Pelletier made Grinnell's only
strong hid in the quarter mile. when
it took officials ten minutes to agree
that Sisk of Marquette and Dunn of

separated the three runners, but
Pelletier was the loser on the deci-
sion. Thomas and Mark placed

by Abbot of Notre Dame and Lewis
