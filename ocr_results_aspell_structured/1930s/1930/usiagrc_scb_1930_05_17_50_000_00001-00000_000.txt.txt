NUMBER 58.

 

Valley Teams
Will Compete

Here in Track

Grinnell Conceded Outside
Chance to Take Lead

in Scoring

Netmen Here Also

Drake Strong in Dashes, Bears
in Field, Aggies, Pioneers
in Distance Events.

Missouri Valley track competition
will be uppermost in Grinnell sports
circles next week, when the other
schools of the conference come here
to make their bids for loop honors
on the cinder pathway. More than
Seventy-ﬁve athletes are expected to
vie for honors in the circult contest
with Grinnel'l, Drake, Washington
and Oklahoma each holding a chance
to come out ahead of the field.

The added events in the outdoor

meet will weaken Grinnell who took
the indoor honors by a three-point
margin. They will, however.
‘strengthen Washington who landed
fourth in the
shelter. Oklahoma will
pull away Crinnall points in the
distance events, and the dashes and
hurdles are almost certain to go to
Drake, giving the Bulldogs a good
chance in advance rating. Creighton
will» enter a. small squad.
Individual Contests Feature

There will be several pretty in-
dividual contests in the meet, the
affair bctwecn Lsnsrude and Collins
of Drake and Miller of Washington
in the pole-vault being scheduled to
hold its share of the attraction. Web-
er of Washington and Douglas of
Grinnell will Step out in the high-
jump. Washington may be able to
provide Podrebarac of Drake with

some competition in the hurdles, but

Curry is likely to have things his own
way in the sprints

Captain Mark and Peiletier of
Grinnell will come through in the
quarter-mile, and Murphy will again
tangle with Gordon of Drake over the
BSD-yard distance. Mcllrath is
scheduled to rank in first place in
the mile and either Pyc or Secor
should nah the two-mile ribbon.

Sem Fees Invalid ,

Since this is not a regularly sched-
uled meet, it will be impossible to
admit students on the presentation
of semester fees. "I trust that the
student body will support the meet,"
said J. C. Truesdale, director of ath-
letics. "They have certainly receiv-
ed their monoy's worth on the nth-
letic program included in the sem-
ester fee. We would like a good at-

tendance Friday and Saturday, for
it will he only 'by a good showing this-

year that We can again hope to Se-
cure Missouri Valley meets of any
sort here.

“Those who attend the meet will
see some of the better trackmcn in
the middle west working in several of
the events. They will not go wrong
by spending their time at the track."

posed of Prof. David E. Peck, first

Statement Must be Made
Definitely About Rooms

Any Grinnell student, except a
freshman or a new student, who has
reserved 11 room in tho dormitories or
quadrangle and has left the room re-
servation fen on deposit with the col-
lege, should notify the dean of men
or the dean of women between Au—
gust 15 and September 1, that he de-
ﬁnitely expects to occupy the room
reserved for him.

Failure to send this notice will not
cancel the room deposit, but will can-
cel the reservation in order that in-
coming freshmen and new students
may have definite reservations when
they come to Grinnell. A student
who has thus lost his reservation may
secure a room according to the usual
order of application.

Tennis Squad
Trims Aggies

Jones, Kenf Win in Singles,
Lose Doubles to Take
2-1 Victory.

Grinnell‘s two-man team ‘of Capt.
Donald “Jibby” Jones and John
Kent avenged their defeat of a month
ago at Stillwater, when they turned
back the same two men from Okla-
homa Agricultural and Mechanical
college, on the local courts Wednes-
day afternoon.

Jones was playing peerless tennis
and his opponent, English, in spite of
his beautiful ,forehand cross-court
drive. could not prevent the Pioneer
number one man from taking the
match in straight sets, 8-6, 6-4.

Kent playing the number two pus:
ition was forced to three sets be-
fore he grasped victory. Sawnllisch
of Oklahoma took the first set, 6-3.
but faltered in the next two. losing
6-4, 6-3. Kent displayed some real
tennis in the last couple of sets, us-
‘ing a deadly not kill to advantage.

Oklahoma's only win came when
they won a three-Set decision in the
doubles play. The Pioneer combina-
tion won the first set and seemed
headed for victory, but the southern
.pair rallied to outdrlve, out-lob and
out-place a fast tiring Grlnuell team,
7-5, 6-3. The spectacular teamwork
featured the attack of English and
Snwallisch in the deciding set.

The summary: '

Jones, Grinnell, defeated English,
Oklahoma Aggies, 3-6, 3-4.

Kent, Grinnell. defeated Sawallisch,
Oklahoma Aggies, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.

English and Sawallisch, Oklahoma
Aggies, defeated Jones and Kent,
Grinncll, 4-6, 1-5, 6-3,

Grinnell Net Team
Loses in Tourney

Captain Donald “Jibby” Jones and
John “Rally" Kent were both elim-
inated in the first round of singles
play of the Central Intercollegiate
tennis tournament held in Chicago.
The two Pioneer players left Grin-
nell Wednesday night and after
hard driving all night, appeared on
the courts almost immediately on ar-
rival. The strain which they had en-
countered was sufficient to mar their
tennis and they lost in straight sets.
John Eglehoff of Detroit university
accounted for Jones. 7-5, 6-2, while
William McNaughton, of Detroit
City college. was Kent's conqueror,
9-7, 6-4.

Paired in the doubles, Jones and
Kent again faded out of the picture
in the first round when they were
handed a 3-2, 7-5, setback by War-
ren Byrum and Frank Householder
of Western State. The Grinnell com-
bination made a valliant bid for the
second set but failed after numerous
brilliant rallies.

‘Spring Time in Merrie England’
to Be Twent

By ROBERTA VANCE.

The annual May fete, “Spring Time
in Merrie England," which will he
presented the evening of May 23 at
eight-fifteen in an amphitheater
erected on the middle campus, will
be the twenty-first May pageant giv-
en in Grinnell. In 1909, when May
festivals were events of unusual in-
terest. Grinnell bad its first May
fete, which consisted of a simple
May pole dance. From 1909 on, each
year's presentation has become more
and more elaborate.

“The Birth of a Rose,” written by
Bessie Hatfield, a Crinncll student,
given in 1915, was the first depart-
ure from the simple May pole dances.
After this the May festivals took the
form of Greek pageants, the most
spectacular of which was 4‘ A Spring
Festival to Artemis" given in 1916.

Allegorles Given

“The Golden Wish" and "The Spir-
it of Grinncll,u both written by Miss
Clara J. Anderson, director of
physical education for women, given
in 1919 and 1920 were both allegor-
ical presentations. In 1924 the man
in the moon was let down from the
trees in his moon bird in his “Quest
For the Moon Goddess." In 1926
Pluto captured “Persephone” and
took her to his underground king-
dom, and in 1927 “Pandora" had
much trouble with the evils penned
up in her box. “The Enchanted
