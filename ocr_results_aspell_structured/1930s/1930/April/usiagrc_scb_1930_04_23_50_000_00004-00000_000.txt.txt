lllnrrn in Kansas

Kansas is about three weeks near—
er summer than Iowa. All the
leaves are out and the sun was hot
Sdtlll'day.morning as we watched
Benny Douglas completing the last
events in the decathlon. In fact a
couple of the boys got sun-burned.
Saturday was an ideal day for the
relays. The sun shone in the mom-
mg and prompted many Kansas
City folks to drive to Lawrence for
the carnival. Shortly after one o'<
clock in the afternoon the sun went
under a cloud, thus eliminating
shadows for the remainder of the
day.

'A brisk wind from the south
helped Claude Braoey and Cy Leland,
those dash men from the Lone Star
state, to tie the world mark _in the
century at :09.4 seconds. Outside
of this the day was perfect and many
persons were on hand to see the
athletes break fourteen records,

Although the Grinnellians did not
place in the mile relay, they showed
good time in making the run in 3:21.
Howard Monrath came in third in
the soooemeter run.

counted for one year of those re-
quired. This physical education
work is entirely separate from the
theory courses now offered toward
a physical education major.

Golf Team Loses
Match to Iowa

(By Courtesy of The Daily Iowan.)

IOWA CITYiThe veteran Univer-
sity of Iowa golf team proved too
much for the Grinnell Pioneers here
Saturday and took the long end of
a 22yz to 11/2 score.

The superiority of the Iowa ag~
gregation was evident in the morn~
ing round of singles when the Grin—
nell team was able_to gather only
1/2 point due to the efforts of John
Lund. The point gained in the af—
ternoon was credited to Lund and
Capt. Meredith Heldridge playing in
the four-ball foursome.

Heldridge of Grinnell, and Agnew
of the Iowa team. led the afternoon
scoring each turning in a 79.-

ally in shape to play on yesterday,
and all the varsity squad worked out.
While Jones and Kent are sure to
keep their places on the team, keen
competition is expected for the third
and fourth places on the team, and
especially for the fourth place where
Beck, Chuck De Long and Bryan
will seriously contest the right of
Allen to play in the next match and
for the remainder of the season.

The next appearance of the local
netsters comes Saturday against
Washington university here, and this
dual will be followed by six others
during the month of May, all on the
Grinnell courts. The team will also
compete in the valley tournament at
Omaha and play Drake at Des
Moines the latter part of May. A
great improvement in the squad is
expected by Saturday of this week,
if good weather continues and the
team is able to continue its strenu-
ous workouts outdoors.
