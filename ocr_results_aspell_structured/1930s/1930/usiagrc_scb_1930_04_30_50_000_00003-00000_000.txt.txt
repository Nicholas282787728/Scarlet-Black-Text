‘American Undergraduate Improving
Intellectually,’ Declares Dean Beatty

By HAROLD FORRESTER.

“I am certainly convinced that the
American undergraduate is steadily
improving intellectually," stated
Shelton L. Beatty, dean of men.
when interviewed concerning his re-
cent trip to Kansas City, where he
spoke to the students of the various
high schools in the city, "I was
amazed," he continued, “at some of
the very intelligent questions asked
of me concerning Grinnell college."

“Distinguishing the Excellencies of
Students” was the subject of Dean
Beatty's talks. On one occasion he
spoke to seven hundred students or
the Paseo high school, and on anothr
er he addressed the Kansas City Hi
Y organization.

"I was impressed by the very large
number of select students to be
found in these high schools." he re-
marked. ”We ought to have many
more of them attending Grinnell.
They compare very favorably with
the type of students desired at Grins
nell.”

Dean Beatty pointed out that
many of the scholarships offered to
Grinneil students are provided for by
Crinnell alumni living in Kansas
City. While in the city he visited
with Dr. Cleveland Dibble, donor of
Dibble hall, and also met Hilda
Mauck, Crinnell alumnus who is now
a writer of short stories.

During the spring vacation Dean
Beatty drove to Illinois and then
south to McKenzie, Tenn, where he
visited several days at home with
his parents. While in McKenzie he
spoke at Bethel college, where form-
erly he attended school and was a
member of Delta Tau Delta fraterni-
ty. He also spoke at a number of
