Campus Opinion

Do your favor the new
pliin of boring summer school at

Sylvia Joseph. I think that it
would he a good idea if they can en-
courage enough to come to make it
a success.

bliss Kendall: We have always
had inquiries concerning summer
school here, so it seems to be a very
good idea to satisfy those who wish
to come. The equipment is all here
anyway. '

John Canning: I approve of the
new plan, and hope that many of the
students now attending Grinnell will
be able to take advantage of it.

Billie Mathews: It is a good plan
because those who have to go to
summer school will have the con~
venience of going here rather than
to some other school.

Dudley Joy: I 'favor the plan but
not the method. I beiiese that Cours-
es to be offered should be definitely
announced.

Virginia Riniker: I approve of the
summer school plan because it will
give more people an opportunity to
attend Grinneli, and enjoy the cam-
pus at its best.

William Clark: If enough profes-
sors and pupils can be secured so
that a variety of courses can be of-
fered, it is a good plan.

Vera Shouts: It's all right forpeo-
pie who don't have anything else to
do in the summer.

Eunice Logan: It will be beneﬁ-
cial because ’it will get more people
acquainted with the college.

Myrna Adams: 1 think that they
might as well use the buildings and
equipment as have them stand idle.
But personally, I’m not interested.

Charles Laustrup: I do not, since
I don’t think Grinnell will have a
chance against the schools that have
already started such plans.

Aloha studier: It is a fine idea for
those who want to specialize in one
subjectiplhy production or music.
But isn't it too hot in Grinnell in the
summer?

Plays ,Are Comedies

“Where But In America" a comedy

has also had experience in plays at
Grinnell. This play has a New
York setting, the scene taking place
in the dining room of a young mar-
ried couple. Mr. Espanhayne, the
husband. will be played by Walter
straley, with Margaret Wood taking-
the role of his wife. Virginia Read
will take the part of Hilda, the maid.
who astounds the Espanbaynes with
an almost unbelievable announce-
ment.

charge of Gladys Goodrich. Props
will be in care of Dorothy boring—
while the costumes and the make-
up are left to Winifred Keloh. Joe
Irwin will supervise the lighting as-
sisted by Ruth Sankey.

sent quite a. variety, they are all
comedies. Some of the best talent in
school will be-seen in these three
