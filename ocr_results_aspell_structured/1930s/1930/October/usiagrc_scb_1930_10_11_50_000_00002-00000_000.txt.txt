REPORTING DISTAN’I‘ GAP/ES

Thc Scarlet and Black tllis afternoon
presents to its readers the ﬁ st complete news-
paper account of a Friday night football game in
which Grinllcll college participated away from
home.

At considerable expense The Scarlet and Black
followed metropolitan papers last week ill secur-
ing the services of a special writcr alld paying
telegraph charges ill order to give its readers the
ﬁrst story of the Grillncll-Marqucttc lligllt foot
ball game in Milwaukee. Satt day morning dai cs
which come to Grillnell are printed about midnight,
and carry only a few paragraphs summarizing the
affair in addition to the play-by-play account,
which is received during the garlic.

It is in keeping with the policy
The Scarlet and Black last spring: “Special cover-
age of distant athletic events in whirh Grinncll
participated,“ that the wire story and summary
of the G~‘llnell-Detroit game is printed today.
Sports editors of the papers of colleges which Grin-
ucll has played in football this year have cooperate
ed willingly in writing accounts of thcirrcspcctivc
teams for the Wednesday editions. This fall Tllc
Scarlet and Black has also printed pictures of the
coaches and important players of teams which have
played Grinnell.

Coach Watt’s football team has played Dilly
one game at home, and three more are scheduled
under the Ward ﬁeld lights. Two of the ﬁve ell~
counters on foreign gridirons are over, and games
for the Pioneers are still to be played in Des
Moincs, Northﬁeld, and St. Louis.

Pioneer engagements on other ﬁelds no longer
seem far away. Grinncll is proud of the Pioneer
who ﬁght for it, and The Scarlet and Black is glad
to do its part in serving as the medium by which
readers may ﬁrst learn the news of their football
representatives “on other hills.”

GRINNELL-IN-CHINA.

It is a rare thing to find an enterprise that is
both efficiently managed and directed toward the
accomplishments of a worthwhile purpose. In
Grinncll this unusual combination is the Pioneer
chest.

a gain

outlined by

The Pioneer chest movement, as sponsored by‘

the Young Men’s Cllri ian association and the
Young \Vomcn’s Christian association, is well
managed. The campaign for subscription to the
chest is always well planned and carefully carried
out, and the funds derived therefrom are carefully
budgeted so as to get the greatest possible result
from every dollar.

The largest part of the funds from this project
go to the support of Grinllcll-ineCllina. Considering
China’s situation at prcsent, the greatest potential
force in world affairs and needing only intelligent-
Iy dircctcd education to bring all its dreams ’of
future greatness into realities, there is no need to
say that the Pioneer chest through its support of
Grillncllrin-China is dedicated to a Worthwhile cf.
fort. Every dollar that is contributed to the chest
helps, in a figurative scnsc, to light the path of this
great nation back to a position of pucdnctiveness
and power in the world of today,

Every fall the Pioneer chest is opened to give
Grinncll its chance to help make Grinncll-in-Cbina
possible. The five, 10, 15 dollars, that you Will
have forgotten all about a week or two after you
have given it, will have a tremendous effect in
China. Support the chest morc liberally this year
than ever before, G

THE TOWN MEN ORGANIZE

At the town mcn’s meeting Wednesday even-
ing a closer organization of the group was con
sidercd. It is likely that the town freshmen Will
put on stunts duing Homecoming week, that town
men will have their own intramural teams instead
of playing with their associated buildings, and that
they will hold their own parties and open houses.

This would not be to separate themselves from
college life, but rather by doing the things the
other groups do to make themselves all integral

part of it, . .

YOUR SON-AT COLLEGE AND ms CAR
(From'the Christian Science Monitor)

This is the time of year when the momentous ques~
tion as to whether your son shall have the extra car
at college is the chief domestic issue. Either you have
allowed him to take it, trusting to his innate modera-
tion and good sense, and are having doubts as to wheth-
er it may not be a hindrance to his studies; or you have
not done so, and are being importuned by letters which
are reasonable and plausible enough to make you feel
like an arbitra’ry old oodger.

Early last spring one anxious father, with a son
then a sophomore at a New England college, had an
experience which may have some value to other parents
facing similar problems. Returns of the midsemester
indicated that there was a possibility that the boy would
be placed on probation. The father, who in his own
business was used to going to the root of the situation,
took the next train out: to his son's college town. on an
unannounced visit.

Before making his presence known, he spent a little
time in the neighborhood and engaged in casual con-
vrsation with the older olassmen. He learned that a
boy who has a car at college is not the only one who
has occasion to desire its use; his popularity is some-
how enhanced; suggestions of appealing expeditions
come from many new friends. The father felt that in
the case of his son, Lhis possibly was the key to the
solution. He put the boy's radio in storage; he loaded
the portable phonograph and all the records in the back
seat of the old car; he cut down the boy's allowance to
a point. which would make it. possible for him to get an
education and some recreation, but not much else; and
he drove home,

The measure, he reports, after six months, has
worked well. He restored the car to the boy during the
summer vacation for use until school began. He has
promised that, after a satisfactory record of work and
evidence that the boy would graduate without difﬁculty,
the old car, or possible a new one, would be lent to him
in April, 1932, so that it might grace the memory of
the last two months of college.

Of course, there is no set rule for dealing with the
car-otecollege question. Much, of course, depends upon
the individual boy. But often, when students seem to
have difficulty with mathematics, physics, Latin or
English, the actual difﬁculty is with distracting recrea-
tions. In such cases this father's recipe is worth con-
sideration.
