BEA'I'EN BEFORE THE GAME?

Tomorrow evening a college pcp meeting for
the Crciglltoerrimlell Homecoming game will be
held in the Alumni Recitation hall and on \Vard
field. It will be the first chance this year for
Grilllicll students to Show their belief or disbelief
in the football team of Coach Lester \Vatt.

Judging by the number of Grillncllians
present at the union station, when the team left for
Marquette, Dctr0lt, and Carleton, the student body
would rather not bother itself by showing the,
Pioneer eleven that even though the odds are
against it. Grillucll believes in the scarlet and black.
Perhaps the scllllroffs for the football men came at
times when many students were working ill either
the quadrangle or dormitory dining rooms. 110w-
eycr, that fact ﬂt' Ounts for only 75. and out 01' a
student body of 650 there should bc more than
between 80 and 100 present at a station pep rally.
Student work will not conflict witll the assembly
tomorrow evening.

At the gnme Friday evening the slmlonl body
will occupy a oomplclc section in thc north end of
the stadium. {are is a (‘llﬂllCC for the lllllclr
talked-of “(i illllcll spirit” to be shown. The
Pioneer club will serve as the nucleus of the root-
ing section. alld l'llc yells and Songs of Grillncll \ll 1
for once be given by those who know tllc words.

Cl-c'dlltoll may he favored to will the game.
Members of tile team gave all they had in an
attempt to defeat Drakc two weeks ngo, but Friday
evening they have promised to do more than that—
to make the 1930 Grillncll Homecoming a “star-
light success with a night football victory over the
Blucja

Is it possible for the strident body to give more,
than they have, from the sidelines? \Vill the audb
toriunl in the Alumni Recitation hall tomor ow
cvcning bc parked? Will the studml body how
Creighton that Grinncll can stage a comeback on its
football schedule as well as in a basketball game?

BACK TO OLD GRH‘INELL.

What a ll0st of memories that bit of the alumni
song brings back to cacll alumnus if he but stops to
think for a moment ..... the college Glee club
singing the hymn on the night before commence-
ment, the commencement exercises themselves the
next day, the ambitions and hopes of college days
for the carccr to follow them . . . . and this week
many of G llllcll’s “students loyal” are coming
back to the cllcs of those memories, to their col-
lege mother’s Homecoming.

Their alma mater is glad to have tllcm back
and extends the best of her hospitality and cheer
for their benefit, hoping that they will cnjoy what
she has to offer them. Night football for the first
time this year is one of Grinllcll’s proud offerings
to its Homecoming crowds, and will he the gala
event of Friday night. A reception and a dance
will follow the game.

Zone Gale, author, critic, and winner of the
Pulitzer prize for the bcst play of 1920, will speak
ill Herrick chapel at 2 p. m. Saturday afternoon in
the main attraction of the day to the large number
of Homecomcrs expected this year. Saturday morn
ing Gates ball will be formally and impressively
dedicated, Another dance, .a faculty tca, an organ
recital, and two other addrc. . complete tllc list
that Grinncll offers for the entertainment of its
Homecoming crowds this year.

Miss Gale’s appearance here offers undoubt-
cdly the greatest value to the Homecomcr of any
event on the two-day program. She is one of
America’s foremost contemporary writers of drama,
poetry, short stories, and novels, and has won
distinction in contests in cash field. She is also a.
noted critic of modern literature.

It: is not often that one gets first hand contact
with a personage of such rank in her chosen field,

TEE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

and Gl'illl‘tcll is especially fortunate ill being able to
offer tl feature of its Homecoming program on
Saturdt ftcrllooll. Many people who perhaps will
not be able to reach Grillllcll ill time for the football
gaunt Friday night, will arrive to hear Miss Galc
the next afternoon.

With this elaborate program Grilmcll welcomes
Cl't‘t’)’ old student and visitor.

BRDAD‘CAST THE GAME

The Grillnell-Crcigllton football game of last
year was on the air. Scol . of Gl'illllell students
Spent their thanksgiving aftellloons at home, while
the wintry blizz' d chilled the outdoor air, lllld
heard the Pionec s slip and slide their way to a
12 to 0 victory ill Omaha.

This your there again will be many football
fans. who cannot attend the CI'ciglltnn-Grillncll
game and would like to hear it over the ﬁll Pol--
llaps Crcigllton Students would llppl‘Ct’ to parking
ill on easy cluhroom chair llcxt Fr day night to
hear the story of tho Grillncll Holliecomiug contest
orcr thc,l'aflio. At any role, tllc game certainly dc-
scrvcs broadens illg,

Although Gl'illllcll has no radio station of its
own, it is not far from one which could broadcast
the game by remote control. Marshalltown is 30
miles away, Des Moilles 60, and Waterloo 65. All
of these cities have stations which could handle
the contest. Grillncll is one of Iowa’s leading
schools and certainly there is interest in its Homo-
comillg. Why not give Pioneer supporter, what
they want? ,

Two years ago the Grillncll Homecoming con-
test was successfully broadcast, alld Iowa State
college students heard their pouacrtlll Lindbloom
turned back to the tune of 3 to 0. This year tllc
some is at night. The reception will be ml ,h better
and there will be many more people, who will ﬁnd
tilllc to listen ill, even though they cannot got to
tho, same. Broadcasting the contest would be .1
worthwhile step for thc allege.

WELCOME!
By President J. H. ’1‘. Main
(From tho Grinnell Homecoming Program)

Homecoming is always a day of good cbee ! We
extend a. hearty welcome to you, one and allfto our
friends and alumni of “old Grinnell"—and also to ”our
friends, the enemy!” We bespesk a good day— a happy
dayifor everybody.

Among the by-produets of a college education are
the personal contacts that result in friendship and good
will. They enter life and become a part of it, They re-
main long ye‘drs after college life is over. They grow
more precious. Their ﬂavor lasts!

It is true that we forget much that we get from
hooks and discussions in the class room. But the real
friendships abide. Tbey reveal themselves unconscious
ly and continuously in our plans and ambitions as years
go by.

or course the Homecoming is focalized on the game.
May it be a glorious battle! We shout not only for the
team, but for the pure joy that is in us-our joy in youth
and strength and because we are members of a great
commonwealth of friendship and good will. May there
be a Joyous renewing of loyalties to old Grinnell, and
to each other!

COEDS ARE CONCEITED
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Sisters of the campus! We aren't going to Waste
effort or space by beating around the bush. What is to
be said is going to be shot straight from the shoulder
with the intention of landing our blow on the button.
For some unwarranted reason the Northwestern coed
is snooty, conceited, egotistic, grandiloquent, pretentious,
arrogant, proud. stilted, and Vain, We have had the
foregoing suspicion inhibited for along time but it took
the Illinois weekend to substantiate by comparison our
opinion.

The women on this campus should leave their con—
ceit in their sorority wigwams. Any person with other
than splash-pan mentality would know that egotism is
not the way to popularity in any society or group, least
of all on the college campus. It is better to keep still
about one's merits and achievements and better still to
forget them. Illinois coeds are sociable as the Maker of
this world intended that his creations should be, Try
and be just at little bit friendly and attempt a smile or
a word in the general direction of one of our stilted
feminine associates, and the erring individual is stopped
colder than a barbecue sandwich.

You women not as if the men were so low that they
would have to have a special dispensation from heaven
to raise them to the level of total degradation. So how
about coming down off of your side-saddles before the
horse throws you. Break down and reward the campus
with the gleam of your pearly teeth, if any. Don't worry;
merit, ability and powers of leadership ﬁnd their just
recognition as surely and as properly on an American
campus as in any place in the world.

We doubt if the editors will publish thisAt‘nere may
be women on the board. If they do any defense will be
welcomed and answered if possible. But it is probably
assuming too much to expect that any of our famed
coeds would momentarily hesitate from prirnping their
grandilaquent bunoombe and stoop to an explanation of
their mannerisms.
