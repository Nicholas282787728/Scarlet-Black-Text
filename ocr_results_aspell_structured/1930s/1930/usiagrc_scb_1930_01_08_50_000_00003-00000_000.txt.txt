The athletic deuartment has al—
resdy spent its share of Grinnell's
Education Foundation uppl'oprlallion.
The new gymnasium scoreboard is

lprctty sanzzy, and is much more
practicable than building a new gym.

We wish to sincerely thank all
those who sent us Christmas greet-
, ings. Both of them were very orig-
inal, and the sentiment was beautiful.
A word to “Harold," however, bloke
would have rhymed with choke bet-
ter than half-wit did.

We received a fine letter from
"Hellraiser" Woodburn during the
holidays. Brewster has moved to

r’V‘aterloo, and wanted his address
chlnged on the mailing list, so as not

to hiss any Doric column. (Advr)

Some of the boys won't have to
wear their over-coats any more, now
that they can‘t go back in the lib-
rary stacks. Some of the pockets of
moss 1929 coats wouldn‘t hold a
goodvslzed hook. anyway.

Paramount announces that their

'Makers of Men," which is said to
glorify the American college girl.

Elsewhere in today's paper is a
story concerning Majestic Canning,
and a contribution of his accepted
by the st. Louis Globe-Democrat, the
argest paper west of the Mississippi.
‘ohn evidently believes in being his
iwn press agent, for although the
Shry was anonymous, it has that
mirhty, majestic atmosphere all
thringh it. Congratulations, John.

....I hereby resolve that 1 will never
miss the Saturday morning chapel
service nor will I take any more
books from the library stacks, with-
out permission . . . and I promise my-
self at least six hours» of sleep per
night, next Christmas vacation,
whether I need it or not . . . and Ire-
solve that I will refrain from attends
ing foreign theatres, and will wait
until the shows come to Grinnell,
even though I have to take post-
graduate work to see them . . . I will
labor well,’ and work mightily, and
keep my right eye upon the light.
even though my roommate breaketh
it . . . I will take myrest, my nourish-
it . l . I will ts‘ike my rest, my medi-
cine . in short, I will make of my
self a man, even such a one as is Klke
Wilhelm, my cherished ideal.

We hope Santa Claus was kind to
all of you, and that he was especially
careful to bring Eleanor her flan-
nel pajamas, (to put under her pillow
in case of fire); a new wick for the
Grilmell Lantern, to replace the one
consumed by the Women's League
Board; and a camera for Walter Se-
cor, so he can take pictures of him
self all day long.

Miss Brucra Dedmsky spent
Christmas vacation in Chicago, where
she did research work.

Grinnellians Have
Banquet in Omaha

Fifty past, present and prospective
Grinnellians enjoyed a dinner in the
palm room of the Fonteneile hotel in
Omaha on the evening of December
28th. Edward Tyler presided as
toastmaster and called for speeches
from Dr. W. A. Willard, president or
the Grinnell alumni in Omaha; Dean
Shelton L. Beatty; Charles Laustrup;
Sheppard Taylor; and Fillmore
Gwynne Vaughan. president of the
freshman class.

Dean Beatty told of his first lm»
pressions as a newcomer to Grinnell.
stating that the Grinnell spirit which
prevails no the campus manifests it—
self almost at once to the newcomer.
The toast program closed with the
showing of slides of the Grinnell
campus and different phases of stu-
dent life. '

The freshman dance which was to
be held shortly after the holidays
has been postponed until next sem-

and certainly there should be created
a school of citizenship and public are
fairs. Nor would I forget for a min-
ute the need for a men’s union and
for enlargement of the dormitory
equipment, as that enlargement is
needed.” ‘

All these building projects are
taken care of in the elaborate archir
tect's plans which represent President
Mdin's "ideals in brick and stone for
the Grinnell of the future," an ideal
which invisages enlargement of the
student body along with enlargement
of the building facilities to include
about ﬁve hundred men and live hun-
dred women.

Building Plaimed

Provided for in the,plnns are the
extension of the men's dorms to form
a complete quadrangle, a men’s union
in the open ﬁeld south of freshman
field, a fieldhouse south of Ward field,
extension of the ARI-I. to form a

facilities for physics, the building of
a chemistry building and” of 3. build-
ing for biology northeast of the men's
gymnasium, a. fine arts group on the
south Campus and the addition of a.
beautiful tower to the chapel.
Calling attention to the gifts made
in the recent drive, President Main
said: “To me the gifts made are
tremendously significant in two ways,
For one thing, nearly 300 alumni con—
tributed, alumni who graduated from
Grinnell as long as fifty years ago,
and yet who still feel the same spirit
of devotion to the school that they
fell: when they were students on the
campus. Then. on the other hand, we
have the gilts of such men as Thomas
W. Lamont and Arthur Curtis James,
men who are doubtless solicited for
money many times a day, men who
have no connection with Grinnell,
who have never seen Grinnell as an

. institution that deserves to be pre—

 

served and supported that it may con-
tinue to grow,"
Debt Incurred in Building

“Many people have asked what this
debt of $600,000 is that the college
had to meet as part of its campaign
for the gift from the General Educa—
tion board,” Said President Mam.
“That debt has been absorbed in
buildings put up in the years before
19207bulldings necessary to carry
on the school, such as the A.R.H.
auditorium and an enlarged heating
plant, to say nothing of the men's and
women's dormitory systems, toward
which part of the sum want. When
we raised that $600,000 we weren’t
paying off just an abstract debt7
we were building for the gradual de-
velopment of Grinncll college."

“By April 1, 1930, it is my hope
that Gr’innell may realize the goal
we started for nine years ago," Mr.
Main concluded. “If we do, we shall
have added to our permanent endow-
ment 8. sum of a million and a. half
