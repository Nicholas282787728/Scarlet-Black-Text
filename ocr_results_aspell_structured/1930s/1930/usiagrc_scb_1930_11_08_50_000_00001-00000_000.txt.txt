The 1930 All-Dorm speedball teams
were chosen by the six building cap-
tains. Each captain submitted his
all-star team and with each of their
suggestions counting as one vote, the
above teams were selected.

Since the men were chosen because
of their ability 'and not because of

Pilbrow, Mcllralh

Cross Finish—Line

Secor,

Together

The Grinnell cross-country team
defeated the Drake barriers here this
afternoon by the score of 36 to 19.
Pilbrow, Mclirath, and Secor crossed
the finish—line at Ward field in the
time of 2d. 1.

other placings in the 3.3 mile run
were, Van Lanningham, Drake,
fourth; Hyland, Drake, fifth; Bar-
ber, sixth; Pye, seventh; Gordon,
Drake, eighth: Jackson, Drake, ninth,

and Lees, Drake, tenth.
With Barber back in the lineup for

today's meet, Grinnell's cross coun-
try held an even ch‘ance in its first
home dual this season, against Drake
this afternoon. Barber, whose in—
crease in time has been better than
that of any other man on the squad,
was out for the meet with the Uni-
versity of Iowa last week.

Phil Risser was still out of running
competition with an injured leg, but
the rest of the outfit. including its
three lettermen, Fye, Capt. Mcllrath,
and Secor, was ready to tangle with
the Bulldog harriers. Others rune
ning for Grinnell were Pilbrow, Bare
beres and Gerhardt.

Pilbrow was given the edge for first
place before the meet. Gordon of
Drake being his chief competition.
Gordon, although not well known as
a cross country man, has been set-
ting the distance paces during the
regular Missouri Valley track seasons
for the last two years.

Capt. Bruce Bairnsfather
Praised as Lecturer by

Huff, Philadelphia Forum

When Capt. Bruce Bairnsfatber,
British war ofﬁcer and cartoonist of
world fame, speaks here at Herrick
chapel at 11 o’clock Friday morning,
Nov. 14, to furnish the second num-
ber of the Grinnell college lecture
course, which will be free to delegates
attending the Iowa High School Press
association convention, his hearers
will be given a rare entertainment,
according to advance reports of his
successes elsewhere.

Prof. Edward B. T. Spencer, chain

man of the lecture course committee,
has received the following letter from
William K. Huff, executive director
of the Philadelphia Forum, concern-
ing the poplarity of Bairnsfathers
address there:
«Hm his appearance at the Phila—
delphia Forum last night at the
Academy of Music, Bairnsfather had
an audience of 2,000 and I have sel-
dom seen that audience enjoy any
thing as thoroughly as they did his
talk, At times laughter was so con—
tinued and insistent that Captain
Bairnsfather had difﬁculty in break-
ing into it to continue his lecture.
Captain Bairnsfather is a cha‘mning
and delightful fellow and he certainly
made a great bit here."

 

 

results are interesting. Gates and
Dibblc each have three men on the
ﬁrst team, Smith and Clark hall
have two and Langan has one Clerk
leads on the second team with four
representatives, Gates and Smith
next with three and Dibble with one.
Building Three did not rate a man
on either team.
Scott Unanimous

There was little question in elect-
ing the men to the ﬁrst team, Scott
was an unanimous choice although
one of his six votes nominated him
for a forward berth. He has earned
his position on this mythical team
from his scoring alone. During the
ﬁve games that his team played,
Scott chalked up 52 points which is
a record in itself.

Here is what one of the captains
said about him: “Scott is the most
outstanding speedball man I have
seen in my four years of watching it
fills guy that won the cup for Gates.
Fast, shifty, best dribbler in the
dorms and fully conscious of all sing
les of the game."

Stan Hipp of Langan was the only
other man to receive six votes. He
was the man around whom Langan
had to-build its team and it was Hipp
who prevented opponents from turne
ing their games with Langan into
slaughters. Hipp was probably the
hardest man in the game to get past
and his sturdy kick was an asset.

Kukolich Good

For the goal guard position, Kuk-
olich received ﬁve of the six votes.
He was outstanding at his job and
played an instrumental part in the
Gates triumph. only in the last game
of the season did he allow a kicked-
goal to be scored.

Holmes and Graeber were chosen‘

for the wings because of their speed,
drive and ﬁght. Gwynne~Vaughn and
DeLong were given their positions
because of their ability to stay with
the ball. Both are fast and aggres-
sive and inspirations to their teams.
There was no question About the half-

back men, Wolfe of Gates and Robin- j

son of Smith. These men were heady
players and experts in advancing the
ball. Roth and Davis were awarded
the positions of guards because they
were deft at knocking down passes,
displaying clever footwork, and got
off some nice punts.

Second Tam Difﬁcult

In Use selection of the second team
there seemedlto be some difficulty.

Student Council to Discuss
Longer Thanksgiving Period

The Student council has asked
members of leading campus organiz-
ations to meet in the quadrangle lit—
tle theater Sunday afternoon at 2:30
to discuss the advisability of trying
to procure a longer vacation period

oil of house chairmen, Women's self
government league and student coun-
cil are to be present with the officers

. of the women’s athletic association,

if the number warrants this, the rep-
resentative organizations will suggest
the vacation change to the faculty.

Theater Workshop Must Construct
an Old English Setting on Stage

To create an imposing old English
room on a postage stamp stageithdt
is the problem which confronts the
production staff for “The Perfect
Alibi."

Old hand-carved English furniture,
row upon row of built-in bookcases,
hangings dyed just the right shade
to look like velvet, a hand—wrought
coat of arms, a painting of the fam-
ily ancestor in oils so old that the
paint is crackingiall these and
countless odier technical necessities
to the play keep the Experimental

Theater workshop humming.
Production is under the direction

of Ruth Bauer and Virginia Read.
with Irwin Oxley, masterrcarpenter;
Margaret Wright, designer and chief
executor of the Woodrcdrvings; Ger-
trude Stevens, collector and curator
of Ludgrove library; Alice Jewell,
hunter and creator of important furn-

iShmgS and what—riots.

can Grinnell students imagine an
imposing old English room on the
Alumni Recitation hall stage 7 They're
going to see one there. When they
saw "The Emperor Jones" they be—
gan to wonder if Joyce Kilmer was
right about the art of tree-making.
When they see Ludgrove library
they’ll wonder even morc how Gn‘n~
nell college Experimental theatre can
build such a study on a In by 20
foot area.

It isn’t an easy task, but the an;-
cicnt art of illusion is an alluring one
to the theater artists aforementioned
and their success in applying it to
the play in hand is contributing much
to the successful presentation of the
popular Milne mystery comedy which
will furnish thrills for college and
townfclk on the evenings of Nov. 12
and 13.

Grinnell F rosh
' Trim Bullpups
by 6-0 Margin

Waite, Rose Lead Pioneer
Gridmen to Triumph
in Dope Upset

A blond will-o-the-wisp, 130~pounds
of ﬁghting football material, collab-
orated With a human battering ram
on Ward ﬁeld last night to point the
way for the Grinnell college freshman
football team in its 6 to 0 will over
the Drake university yearlings.

The little blond, Bob Waite, sport~
ing a nose guard that looked like a
mask, and a shifty pair of hips,
started work early in the game,
breaking away in the ﬁrst quarter to
go 51 yards to the Drake 12 yard
mark before he was pulled to earth.
It was a sensational sprint, in which
he cut off right tackle and then
swung back to the left side of the
ﬁeld.

Al Rose, the Pioneer battering
ram then took action and went Six
yards in two downs but alateral pass
play failed and on an attempted pass
Waite was downed on the twenty—
yard stripe. Lindstrom pulled the
Bullpups out of danger temporarily
when he sprinted around left end to
midﬁeld,

Rm Plunges oi-er

Waite broke loose twice in succes-
sion in the second quarter, each run
netting 20 yards. With their backs to
the line, the visitors held, but the
kick out of danger was poor and
Grinnell took the ball on the 10 yard
ribbon. Waite carried it off tackle to
the two yard line and Rose plunged
over center for the score. Waite's pass
to Crews for the additional point was
incomplete. ,

Blond Bobby opened the second
half with a 30 yard jaunt but the
Pioneers failed to gain consistently
enough to score again, although the
play was in Drake territory through- ‘
out the period.

The fourth quarter saw a desperate
Drake aggregation opening up with
an aerial attack which, combined
with a pair of 15—yard penalties, set
the-ball well into Grinnell territory,
The little Pioneer line stiffened on
the ten—yard stripe, however, and
halted the Bullpup advance.

Two bad kicks kept the play in
Grinnell territory during the period
but the Drake passing game was ef-
fectually smoothered, and there was
no hope for the Bullpups when they
attempted to drive through the Grin-
nell line.

Offensive is Surprise

The startling offensive displayed
by the Grinnell squad was as much
of a surprise to the Pioneer fans as
to the Bullpups, although Waite did
gain some attention last week when
he romped through the varsity re<
serves for 30 yards,

The Grinnell line was particularly
outstanding during the entire game,
men breaking through the opposing
string time after time. This made up
for some poor tackling on the part of
