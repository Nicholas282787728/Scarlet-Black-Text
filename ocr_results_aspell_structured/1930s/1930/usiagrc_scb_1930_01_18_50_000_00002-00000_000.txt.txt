LONDON—ANOTHER HOPE,

Focusing their eyes on London, the peoples of the
World await the opening of Lhe Five Power Naval con-
ference next week. Such classes as statesmen and
militarists are probably most interested in the outcome
of that conference, but no one class is more vitclly con-
cemed than the college student. This staLEment rings
with truth only when it is remembered that the~ out-
come of such a conference Will be reﬂected in the years
to come, and that those years will see the educated
student of today the leaders of society. Will another
step be taken toward world peace at London that will
make the mantle of leadership toward peace easier to
Wear tomorrow? or will it fail, and cast upon the
leaders of tomorrow the cloak of increased misunder-
standing between nations that may well lead to war?
These are cords that bind the interest of the student of
international affairs to London in the next few Weeks.

Questions that arise before every conference of this
nature are taking shape now, What factors favor suc
cess in the conference; what ones forecast failure?
These questions have been fully answered by many
writers, but because a summary of facts regarding the
conference is essential to an understanding of it, We
therefore present such a summary on the gamble that
in the press of ﬁnal exams, some student may cultivate
an interest in foreign affairs to escape domestic troubles
with his tests, and so perhaps read this editorial.

The five»power conference is meeting as a result of
an invitation issued by Great Britain and the United
States last fall to three other powers, Japan, France
and Italy to meet in London this month to try to come
to some general agreement limiting the construction in
the future of battleships, cruisers, submarines and other
types of naval armaments. But such a sentence does
not do justice to the possible utility of the conference:
the limiting of naval armaments by common consent
would he the frank recognition by the five great powers
that Where competitive armaments exist, peace can not
last; it would he a big step toward general disarmament
based on the same thesis.

What factors favor the success of the conference?
Certainlythc peoples of the various nations. The Na-
tion agrees, when it says: “The peoples, eager for peece,
will back their government representatives in every
move they may make in the direction of armament re-
duction.” What is more remarkable, the representa-
tives of four of the governments, the United States,

TIIE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Britain. Japan and Italy, go to the conference with no
ii-reconcilnblc divergences of opinion. The forces for
limitation rind pence are strong.

Frcnce, mainly, but also Italy, are the "nigger: in
tlic \l'oodpilc," Hartlrheaded, suspicious France lic-
lievcs the Kellogg Fnct is insufficient to safeguard her;
she refuses to see in it an adequate basis for naval rec
duction, Francc may block action on the part of the
conference. She will refuse to give up her submarines
thus rendering it hope rblc for the proposed Anglo-
Alllmlcml limitation of cruisers to Lake place, as “Eng
land can never risk the hostile iisc of French sub-
marines", to quote Llic New Republic, If France will
not limit licr 5“an ine fleet, neither Will Itiily; in fact,
itcly insists on piiity with France in the Mediterranean.

France and perhaps Italy will probnbly make any
general ogrccmcnt impo blc. T , is j st what
France wants. for she desires to bring the whole ques
tion of land, air and water discrniamcnt bcfcre the
League of Nations and only give up her novel threat in
cxchcrigo for large French nrmnments on land and in
the air, In a word, the whole French psychology iS still
permeated by fen

As on crisiver to the probable French action at
London. the New Republic suggests thrit the powers ht
the conference implement the Kellogg Fact by a naval
agreement under which they would agree, “in case of F.
situation menacing the peace of tho signrttcry powcrs,
to consider \vIlht action might be taken.” This. it is
pointed out, might reassure Frcncc sufficiently to draw
her irito an agreement for armament limitation,

Other solutions to tho problems have been present-
ed. They rill find their basis in the common hope of
the peoples of the world at this hour that the states
men at London may see that unless armaments are
limited, peace can never come. They represent the he—
lief of those who think seriously of the [liturgiand
hence of all college Studentsithat, as Henry K. Moi-ton
says in the Monitor: “The men who represent the pews
crs at London have an opportunity to write their names
high on the roll of great statesmen by adding another
to the list of great peace measures. II; is the will to
peace that sends them to London. They must not re»

turn empty-handed."

WE calimENn~s

As a newspaper assumes the 'right of offering cons
structive and destructive criticism to various campus
activities, as well as attempting at times to outline
policies it deems worthy of consideration in settling
campus problems, it is only ﬁtting that at the end of
the first semester the SCARLET AND BLACK should
make a brief survey of the field of campus activities and
make definite commendation for specific accomplish-
mont.

In keeping with this policy the SCARLET AND
BLACK wishes to commend:

The various organizations in school, and Dean
Beutty personally, for sponsoring mixed dinners, as a
progressive step toward making social relations better
at Grinnell.

The School of Music for the fact that it has brought
to our campus three noted musicians in the persons of
Horowitz, Milstein, and piatigorsky; and the Vesper
Choir. also in the ﬁeld of Music, for consistently main-
taining an unusually high stnndard in its progrnms.

The League Board for executing its policies and
duties in the semester now drawing to a close wisely
and justly.

The Malteaser for its outstanding accomplishment
in bringing the work of nationally known artists, writers
and humorists to the campus.

The Recreation committee for the type of dances it
has sponsored on the grinnell social program.

It is pleasant to survey such a group of construc-
tive and worthwhile activities. and to look forward to
an even better showing for the coming semester. The
various groups have had time this ﬁrst semester to per-
fect their organization, and are now ready to make even
greater contributions to Grinnell's campus life than
they have before. A. E. T.

This RECITAL COURSE.

The Piatigorsky recital last night concludes the
concerts in Grinnell this year by Russian musicians,
This was the third of the group which have so complete
iy delighted the college audience. Seldom has the
recital course offered three more outstanding musicians
than Horowitz, Milsteiri, and Piatigorsky, These young
Russians have perhaps interested a college audience
more than would any other group of musicians since
they are men scarcely over college age who have hchiew
ed tremendous success in their chosen fields. The
SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to congratulate Mr.
Pierce and the recital committee on bringing such ex-
cellent talent to Grinnell,

Sometime during his tour he will be
with Milstein, the Russian violinist,
who played in Grinncll in December.
He was surprised to learn that Mil-
stein had been in Grinnell so recently.

Regarding the conditions in Russia
under the Soviet government, Mr,
Piatigorsky was very noncommital.
”I have not been in Russia for seven
years. I do not know much.” With
a shrug of his shoulders, "I hope they
are better,"
