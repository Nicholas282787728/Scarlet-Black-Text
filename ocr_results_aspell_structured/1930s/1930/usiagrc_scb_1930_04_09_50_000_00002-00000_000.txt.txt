RUTH DOESN’T LIKE US.

After getting inside information as to such big uni-
versities as lilinois, Nebraska, Harvard and Princeton
from issues of College Humor, Grinnell students were
surprised last week to see “our own” institution pictured
and described in quite as elaborate fashion in the popular-
magazine. The first reaction was: “Quite an honor to be
chosen as the first small college to be written up in the
same columns previously devoted to large universities."
It was closely followed by a second: "Talk about free
publicity!” Then the gentle reader plunged into Ruth
Suckow‘s article on “Grinnell” and Gary cooper-s con—
tribution on “A College 1 Love" and straightway discov-
ered that while the latter could find nothing but praise
for Gl'lnnell, the former had a hard time finding praise,
to put it mildly!

What shall we think of Ruth Suckow’s criticism of
her alma mater? It is easy to condemn her article .—
what Grinnell man likes to be called ‘a handsome medio—
crity,‘ or what Giinnell girl likes to be referred to as
the ideal mate for that same mediocrity? Who likes to
he told that the Grinnell Spirit fares ill in the world of
affairs? Or that our inner life has done lime to keep
pace with our outer growth? A far better thing to do
is admit that without doubt some of her statements have
elements of truth in them, though her knowledge of
the college is about ten years behind the times. No
writer of the caliber of Ruth Suckow is going to sit
down and “razz” her‘almd mater unless she sees certain
tendencies that cannot in truth be hidden. The value of
her article to the faculty and student body of Grinnell
“as is” lies here; it should stimulate us to a searching

selfeunaiysis. If, after such examination, We ﬁnd her
statements greatly overdone, all well and good, but there
is Certainly a chance that in many Bf them there may
be a kernel of truth,

Such truth should prove a challenge (how
We despise to use that word ”challenge"7yet it
seems to fit) to us to apply such correctives as we may.
Let us have an honest ambition not to be too standardiz-
ed, not to be to ’handsome' in our mediocrity, not to let
our inner life at Grinnell fall behind—these are am-
bitlons which Ruth SuckoW'S article should Stimulate.
After all, though, the other schools reviewed previously
received their own share of “razzing,” they survived. We
shall, too, perhaps in a better way. At least. the pub-
licity and honor, we opine, were almost Worth the critis
cism, E, D. A.

VACATION ASSIGNMENTS.

The unwritten law against assigning work over va-
cations is gencrally respected, but there are isolated
cases in which a faculty member will make an assigm-
ment over the holiday pe iod. Such action is not quite
consistent with the admi istrative policy which recogs
nizes the benefits of breaking the routine of along school
year with brief interludes which may be devoted to com-
plete relaration of some type of work differing from
that required by college courses.

It is only natural that work assigﬂled to students in.
tending to return home, cannot be prepared under ideal
conditions. The distractions offered by high school re-
union parties and other social activities naturally serve
as handicaps to any extensive period of serious study. In
addition, those students living in small towns have not
the facilities such as welliequipped libraries which are
in many cases necessary in meeting Grinnell assigns
ments.

In the case of those students who have taken tempor-
ary jobs either at home or on the campus. a hard day’s
work is much more fatiguing than the morning classes
comprising their daily schedule while school is in ses-
sion, and is not an especially stimulating prelude to an
evening of study.

It might seem that more might be accomplished by
demanding that the students fulﬁll their quota of col-
lege work while school is in session, and they can enjoy
the advantages of a college’s celebrated academic at-
mosphere. A. de P.

 

 

 

Cooper, Suckow I
Write on Grinnell

(Continued from Page 1).

which he steps after graduation,

“There is a certain, unmistakable
dubiousness with which the present
Grinnell is regarded in Iowa,” Miss
Suckow Says. The chief dissatisfac-
tion is an underlying. ungovernahle
suspicion that the inner life of Grin-
nall has done little to keep pace with
its outer growth". Her ﬁnal con-
clusion, however, is more favorable,
for she says: “Grinnell has always
had and does still have a personal
and intimate charm." I
