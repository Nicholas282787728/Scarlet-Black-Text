NIGHT GLASSES THIS SUMMER.

Adult education is now recognized as one of the
outstanding needs of the present age. Grinncll college
has shown her awareness of this fact in offering night
classes for the general public this summer. These

courses are planned for those people who are busy dur-
ing the day time, working in offices, factories or tak-
ing care of homes. This is the class of people that
educators are trying to interest in education at the
present time; these are the voters and citizens of the
country who need to know the workings of our govern-
ment, the inventions of science and the ﬁelds of art and
litersturc in order that life may be more enjoyable.
college studcnts generally think that the education
they acquire during their four years will be enough to
last them during the rest of their life time, and for a
great many of them it has to suffice, but few young
people read the papers and can talk intelligently on
world events, and even if they once become interested
in current events through history courses or other class-
es, their interest soon lapses after the course is ﬁnished.

Adult education classes are for those people who
have gone to college and want to continue their educa-
tion, while at the same time they are working at some
job. They are also for those people who couldn't. of.
ford to go to college between the ages of sixtcen and
twenty-two or didn‘t have the right opportunities, and
now desire to gain the knowledge they missed at that
time. Other people who would beneﬁt by taking exten-
sion work or by attending college classes, would be
those who were forced to leave high school before
graduating nnd now want a general education, or desire
to spccializc along some line.

The old saying that education has just started af-
ter you leave school is doubly true now that adults may
get more education after they have formally ended thcir
school work. Arline Cole.

GRH‘lNELL TENNIS ACCDM'NIODATIONS.

In the spring the outdoor fancy quickly turns to
tennis. It is one of the three sports participated in
while in college that is played after graduation. The
accommodations at Grinnell for tennis arethc poorest of
any sport. But now courts are expensive, and there is
many another need for money here that should be con-
sidcrcd ﬁrst.

However there is one respect in which the playing
here can be made less difficult. Whenever the men
wish to play tennis, even the tennis team, in the after-
hoon. they must plan to take at least two and a half
hours to do it, An hour and a half of this time must be
spent in waiting for a free court.

This easily could be remedied by having s. “sign-
up” system. A list could be posted every morning that
the courts are in playing condition, and those men that
wanted to play could sign up for the court and hour
they wished. In this way they could be assured of n
court at a deﬁnite time. and they would not be forced
to wait an hour or so for a free one. The list could be
handed to the student working on the courts and thus
avoid any possible disputes. This would entail a littic
trouble on snmeone': part, but would be well worth it

to all who like to play tennis.
