The old proverb, "you can't keep
a good team down," proved true last
Saturday afternoon when the com-
bined efforts of Drake and Washing-
ton universities failed to prevent the
Grinnell college track team from
piling up 60% points to win the
Missouri Valley conference outdoor
track championship here.

Drake was second with 42 points,
with Washington holding down third
place with 401/2 markers. Oklahoma
Aggies and Creighton ﬁnished fourth
and ﬁfth. This is the second Miss-
ouri Valley title for the local track
team this season, the Pioneers having
Won the indoor crown in February.
Well—Balanced Team.

The Pioneer victory was not due to
the brilliant performace of a few
stars. but to a Well»bala.nced team
which placed in thirteen Out of siXA
teen events. Drake, after pressing
Grinnell in the early events, found it.
self outclassed when the results of
the long runs and weight competi-
tions were turned in. The track was
fast and the weather ideal.

The mile run provided a thrill for
the crowd when Howard Mellrath,
who was trailing Collins of Oklahoma
by ﬁfty yards on the ﬁnal stretch, un-
corked a remarkable rally to pass the
Oklahoma runner. Barron. one of
the two men to represent Creighton,
won both the dash events and emerg-
ed the only competitor to chalk up
two ﬁrst places. He stepped the
century in 9 9-10 seconds to nose out
Curry, Padreblirac, and Siebert. all
of Drake. He was timed in 22 1-10
seconds for the forlong.

Hensley Takes Lows.
Podrebarac of Drake won the 120-
yard highrhui‘dles with little difﬁcul»
ty, but lost to Hensley of Grinnell in
the low-barrier event. The two run-
ners were neck and neck on the ﬁnal
hurdle in the 220-yard event, but the
Pioneer runner outstepped Podre-
barac on the ﬁnal stretch to the tape,
The 440-yard dash was the big up
set of the meet. Grinnell, which had
been doped to take ﬁrst and second
places, was able only to nab a second.

Charlton Praises
Economic Attempt

The “epoch-making attempt" of
President Hoover to Stabilize in-
dustry was praised by Prof. J. w.
Charlton of the economics depart—
ment of Grinnell college, speaking be—
fore the Iowa Association of Econ-
omists and Sociologists.

Professor Charlton stated that
building Contracts awarded in the
first three months of this year for
public Works and utilities exceeded
by twenty-six per cent the average
for the corresponding period in the
last four years, and added that con-
tracts for road construction have in-
creased over last year.

He said that although residential
building had decreased and unem-
ployment had increased, the Hoover
conferences had helped the country
to recover from a period of busi-
ness depression. He believed that
the reception accorded the Hoover
plan indicated that the business
world is ready for a higher degree of
co—operation and coordination.

The college hand Wlll hold its last
rehearsal of the year tomorrow after-
noon at four-thirty in the band room
on the third ﬂoor of the administra-
tion building. Election of officers
will be held.

Dean Nollen’ s Essay on ‘Biography’
is Feature of Varied July Tanager

By ALBERTA CURTIS.

The July Tanager presents the
usual varied group of contributions.
and maintains the high standard
which has made this publication a
unique one among college literary
magazines.

or particular interest is the ﬁrst
article, an essay on “Biography" by
Dean J. s. Nollen, which will serve
as the foreword to his life of Goethe.
This discussion of the problems of
the biographer, present trends in this
popular ﬁeld, the effect of modern
ﬁction on biography. is made con-
crete as it applies to the life of
Goethe now in the writing. The in-
troductory contrast between two
schools of biography as represented
by Carlyle and Strachey. is particu-
larly effective.

“South Sea Sketches.” by James
Norman Hall, answers some ques-
tions as to the attitude of this writ-
er which his previous articles have
raised, This group of four sketches
include more personal glimpses of the
famous alumnus than have been

of Grinnell, stud Glen Mathews. .pub-
lisher of The Bank News and also
an alumnus of Grinnell are the as-
sociate pledges to be initiated. Clark
will come to Crinneli from his mid-
dlewest office in Chicago, while
Mathews will drive to Grinnell from
Kansas City.

Donald Clark, president of the
Clark publications, alumnus of Grin-
nell and associate member of Grin-
nell Sigma Delta Chi and Harold
Colbert, '29, associate editor of The
MldContinent Banker and member
of the local journalism fraternity.
will join Mathews in St. Louis and
come with him to Grinnell.

Mr. C. C. Clifton. political editor of
The Des Moines Register who spoke
recently at the Grinnell Sigma Delta
Chi Founders day dinner, is also an
associate pledge, but will not be in: l-
ated Saturday. Clifton is now on
state assignment for The Register,
ﬁling dsily stories on the outlook of
the primary election. which will be
held Monday. ‘

Clark and Clifton were pledged to

tion to join some time ago.

Miss Ruth Atwater,- 29, is doing

Ruff to Captain Quintet
for Grinnell Next Year

Russell Ruff. two year basketball
and football veteran, was elected to
captain the 1930-31 Grinnell college
cage squad at a meeting of the bas-
keteers Sunday night. He succeeds
Harold Wilhelm in that position. Ruff
is house chairman of Building Three
and was recently elected president of
the Student council. He has won
prominence for his sensational pass—
ing on the gridiron.

Other veterans returning to the
quintet for next year will be Benny
Douglas, Carleton Humphrey, Har»
old Murray, DeWitt McCreery and
Royce Mlnier.

 

caught bcforc, and clearly indicate
his reaction to the outside, hustling
world as he views it from his tropic»
a1 home. The ﬁrst sketch, “The
Jungle," is richly atmospheric. “Poly-
nesian Ethics,” "Treasure Trove,"
“Mid-Oceon," are little narratives
with inherent contrasts between the
island standards and modern conven~
ticnal ones.

William S. D. Clark has sketched
a religious communal project which
is familiar to Grinnelliansithe
Amans colonies. As this article is
the result of a personal visit and in~
terviews. it is able to present with
cosiderable sympathy this peculiar
type of life, and the history of the
Amana settlers, “Iowa Communists"
is well worth reading.

“Pink Roses,” a story by Jane
Snowden Crosby, presents a semi-
pathological type of woman in a
rather ordinary situation, that of re-
ceiving the lover of her youth after
she has changed beyond recognltion.

A tiny sketch by Myrna Adams,
"Robin in the Rain ' is good for its
unique description of setting, and for
the humorous, personal flavor of the
experience recounted.

For the book review section. For—
rest Spaulding has reviewed "All
Our Yesterday,” a war novel by H.
M. Tomlinson; Elias Blum. “Albert
Schweitzer-Selbst Dhrstellung," an
autobiography; Grace Hunter, “The
Kramer Girls," by Ruth Suckcw;
Florence Lewis. “New Worlds to
Conquer," by Richard Halliburton:
and Robert J. Myers, “The Black
Christ.” by Countce Cullen. The
selection of books is good, and the
reviews are for the most part judi-
cially written.

Valley Champs
in Truck to Go
to Des Moines

Coach G. Lester Duke, satisfied
with the showing of his Grinnell cln~
der artists last Saturday, although
no definite statement has been made,
will probably enter the entire track
team in the Iowa Collegiate track
and field meet, to be held under the
lights in Drake university stadium
Saturday night.

The meet was founded in 1892 and
was held for thirty—three years with-
out interruption. In 1925 it was dis-
continued beoause the schools felt
that the Drake relays, and the var-
ious conference meets, provided the
athletes of the state with enough
competition. After an interval of
five years the need of the state meet
was felt. and upon the recommenda-
tion of the various athletic heads, the
meet will be revived on the Drake
stadium track Saturday evening.
The last meet was held in Crinnell.

Six schools have entered so far:
University of Iowa, Iowa State col-
lege, Grinnell, Drake. State Teachers
and Simpson. Just how Grinnell's
athletes will stack up against the
competitors from other Iowa schools
is uncertain. The University of Iowa
and Iowa State college are ranked
as the favorites.

Douglas. in the highejump, will be
Crinnell-s best bet. In his workout
Tuesday afternoon he cleared the
bar at 6 feet 1 inch, and if he can
repeat his performance Saturday, he
should win the event. Mcllrath should
be good for a third or fourth in the
mile run, Kukolich will probably
place in the shot. Murray in the dis-
cus, and the mile-relay team looks
like a second or third place winner.

O’Neill’s Play
Will be June 6

Drama to he PresentedAgain

on Friday Evening;
Lamb Has Lead.

The annual commencement play to
he gives lune s at the Colonial
theatre is Eugene O'Neill's “The Em
peror Jones," sponsored by the Grin-
nell chapter of National Collegiate
Players and directed by Sara Sher-

man Pryor. A cast of about thirty
and a production staff of over twen-
ty members of the Experimental
theatre are putting the finishing
touches to the production.

The play was presented here in
December and due to numerous re-
quests to repeat it, the dramatic dc-
partment decided it was a fitting
and appropriate play for commence-
ment. As it is the largest and most
difficult project attempted by the Ex-
perimental theatre, it should give
alumni and commencement guests an
idea of the work being done in the
dramatic department.

The action of the play takes place
on an island in the West Indies, as
yet un—self—determlned by white mar—
ines. The 'form of native government
is, for the time being. an empire,
with the Emperor Jones, on escaped
convict from the United states. hold—
ing all the power.

As the play opens, however, the
time has come when the natives will
stand his autocrscy no longer. While
they are holding a council of res
bellion. the Emporer Jones, having
been warned by Smithers, a Cockney
trader, makes his escape through
the forest, hoping to reach the coast
by dawn and take a. ship to the
states, The play deals with his trip
through the forest and the final vic-
tory of the natives.

The setting and the lighting are
unusually complicated and are band-
led entirely by the students. The
sets, made up entirely, with the ex-
ception of the first scene, of forest ex-
teriors. have been designed and
manufactured in the drama Work-
shop.

The title role of the play is taken
by Arthur Clifton Lamb, who did ex-
ceptionally fine work in the first
presentation. Mr. Lamb is interest-
ed in other phases of the drama. hav—
ing written a one-act play, “The Faith
Cure Man," which was presented in
the Henry York Steiner Memorial
contest and was given second place.
