Special Dispatch.
LAWRENCE, KANrHoward Mc-
llrath, Grinnell’s distance runner.
again won points for the Pioneers
when he ran a fine race to finish
third in the 300—meeter run at the
Kansas relays Saturday. Ray Put»
hem of Iowa State, who is generally
regarded as one of the foremost di
canoe runners in the United States,
won the event in 3 minutes 54.3 Sec~
onds. Lydit of Nebraska came in
second with Mellrath of Grinnell a
close third. The Grinnell runner did
remarkably well considering that the
SDDO-meter run is a much longer
race than his specialty, the mile.
Douglas competition Stiff .

Benny Douglas, of Grinnell, found
the competi on in the decathlon ex—
tremely stiff and the best he could
do was win fifth place. This was
very creditable considering the fact
that he faced some of the best all—
around athletes in the middlewest.
Wilson “Buster" Charles, versatile
Indian athlete of Haskell institute.
copped the teneevent test with 7541
points, establishing a new meet rec-
ord.‘ His teammate, Grant, took
second place, while Boyd of West-
minister and Brooks ‘of Williams
finished third and fourth,

Douglas was in fourth place at the
end of the first five events, which
were held on Friday, and held his
position S‘aturday up to the final
event, the moo-meters. .In this race
Brooks of Williams displayed re-
markable power to win in the good
time of 4:17 and to finish out ahead
of Douglas in the final standings.

Ties For First In Vault

The Pioneer ace tied for first in
the pole vault, took third places in
the shot-put, javelin, and high»jump,
fourths in the 100smetel‘ dash, dis-
cus, broad-jump, 'and moo-meter
run, and fifths in the loo-meter dash
and the loo-meter high hurdles.

The Grinnell mile relay team,
composed of Capt. Robert Mark.
Dyre Pelletier, Hugh Edwards and
Henry Thomas, failed to qualify but
made their best 'time of the season.
They were clocked in 3:27 and man-
aged to pose out the University of
Iowa runners in their division. .

Relay Going Good

The mile relay team of this sea-
son appears .to be rounding into a
better unit than the Pioneers have
had on the field in several seasons.
Dspite their reversals in the larger
meets the men on the relay outfit
have managed to turn in better times
than the quartets of earlier years
and nabbing third at the Central In-
tercollegiate in March mode the fast-
est time that any of Coach G. L.
Duke‘s indoor relay teams have ever

' boasted.

Rodeo Attracts Grinnellians at Kansas;

$5,000 Offer to Ride Steer Not Accepted

tcn for Tim Scarlet and Bloch by

relays mid rcmdhvcd mm the
onllcicr din-inc their clay in
Lawrence.)

By GEORGE CUSHMAN.

The Kansas relay committee ad-
vertised that a real wild west rodco
would be staged for the visiting
teams and coaches Friday night.
Just how wild and western this
bronco-riding contest was, we com
farmers from Iowa. cannot Say, but
as entertainment went, we all enjoy—
ed the affair.

A dclsyed parachute drop was
scheduled to be staged shortly be-
fore the roedo, and for this reason
the Grinnell delegation hurried to the
Stadium shortly after supper so that
the stunt would not be missed. Ex-

 

actly at the designated time on aero-
plane ﬂew over the stadium, but as
far as we know the parachute jump
is still being delayed.

Edwards Tomplcil to Ride

The rodeo company advertised a
prize of live thousand dollars to any
one who could ride, or rather stay,
on one of their Texas steers for three
minutes. Hugh Edwards thought it
was easy money. He could see him—
sclf coming home a better man’fin-
socially. He come home, and per»
haps a better mnn, but you ask him
about the rest.

Judging from the results of some
of those bronco rides, which the
Montana cowboys endured for our
enjoyment, it is just as well that Ed-
wards kcpt his scat in the stands.
Far be it from the Clark hall chair-
man to try and ride one of those
steers, when the cowboys themselves

Tennis Players

Lose 5-] Match
at Ames Monday

 

. Playing its first match of the sea-
son, the Crinnell college tennis team
lost a 51 decision to Iowa state col—
lege Monday at Ames. Jones and
Kent won the only Grinnell victory
in their doubles, defeating Robins
and McMurphy of Ames, 6‘1, 3-6, 6—)
3. All four Ci-innell players were'
seriously handicapped by lack ». of
practice, while in Iowa State they
faced a team which had been prac-l
ticing outside on concrete courts
since the middle of February. 1

Outside of the doubles match tak-
en by Grinnell, the most sparkling
tennis of the day was played by
Robins of Iowa State and Jones of
Grinnell, both captains of their re-
spective teams. The former is rated
as ,one of the five best players in
laws, but found a worthy opponent
in Jones, and the two matched drive
for drive during their three sets, the
Iowa State captain finally winningl
so, 521, 6-1.

After starting Weakly against Mc~
Murphy, Kent rallied to make the
match interesting, but could not
master sufficient punch to win. The
score was, 971, 4-6, 775. Neither De—
Long nor Allen showed much in
Monday's dual. De Long lost to
Hendricks, Iowa State number 3
man, 672, 6—1, while Allen lost the
decision, 26, 6-0, on to Force, num—
ber 4 man of Iowa State. Paired
in the doubles against Hendricks and
Fer-oe, the Grinncll second doubles
team put up little opposition, and
lost, 671, 6-0. A return match is
now being scheduled with Iowa State
for a date later in the season.

Steiner Will Give
Thirteen Addresses

Dr. Edward A. Steiner, professor
of applied Christianity at Gtinnell,
will deliver commencement address-
es this spring in many towns of the
middlewest. Thirteen high schools
and junior colleges have‘already en»
gaged him as their commencement
speaker. His itinerary includes Ver-
million, S. D; Maywood,‘ 111.. and
Eveleth, Minn, as wcll as a number
of towns in Iowa. He plans to speak
to graduating classes several times
a week between the middle of May
and the fourteenth of June.

“It is hard work,” Dr. Steiner said
in commenting on his custom of de-
livering commencement addresses.
"Usually in the small towns the
whole family comes, the babies begin
to cry, the children giggle, and there
is so much confusion that I find it
hard to keep up my part of the Com~
petition." '
