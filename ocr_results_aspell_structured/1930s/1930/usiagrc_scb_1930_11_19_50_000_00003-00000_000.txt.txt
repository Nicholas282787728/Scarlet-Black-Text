After spen ing Sunday and most of
the day Saturday in Cottage Three,
Walter streley has returned to les
ble to take up his residence. Upon
his arrival, he was greeted by e Te<
ception committee who expressed its
delight in his return.

The Morris-Marr aerial attack in
the dining room was not up to its us—
ual standards. The demonstration
was not at all satisfactory according
to quadrangle girls. For further par-
ticulars ask Miss Smith about the
egg under her chair

says Professor non Fossier
speaking before the contemporary
history class: “Nuw as I have
stated in my lectures." What we
want to know is, where does Mr.

Payne come in?

One of our freshmen girls re-
marked to us that it was mighty

nice of Cap 'and Gown to give a

birthday perty for Miss Read. We

think so too.

For the benefit of Mears, we wish

tn state that Lowell Fuller is perm-

anently booked.

“Oui- Iriend," Mr. Bnmdidge, told
us quite cheerfully that gangsters
just shot at gangsters. Does that
man that when they “Hi." someone
else, it down‘t count?

What a roan: He talked about
catching Eaton whales with less

 

p e than we did when .wo caught

a fish in Okoboji.

After all, a person who catches
a fish in that lake, does have
something to talk about:

Kelly Stables held its annual
cantor Saturday night, and a couple of
youngsters, too young to be playing
with matches, set the hay on fire.

of them did the some thing last

A couple of Crinnell lads spent
the latter part of Monday evening
in Oshaloosal We understand
they took a couple of "players”
home after the high school game!

You know folks, we’ve had a lot
of cracks taken at poor little us
about the things we have put in this
here column. Wedl, to tell the truth,
we don't have much to choose from,
not being able to be over "ninety,—
eleven” places at once.

What we’re trying to soy is—why
don’t you hard—hearted students,who
know a lot of dope about your room-
mates and other people‘s roommates,
spill in little of the gore in our ever-
waiting ears? We promise not to tell
a soul where we got it, and we’ll try
and do right by what you tell us.
Let’s have some contribsl

Last game of the season Friday
night: Begin saving your nickeis

Dick Ullrich hasn’t told us what
time he has set to run his long run
for a touchdown, nor how long the
jaunt .would be. It'll probably be
announced in Saturday's s. C B.

P. 5.: We were going to make a
