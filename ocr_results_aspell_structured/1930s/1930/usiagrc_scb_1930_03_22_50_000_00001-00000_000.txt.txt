Tone Ensemble Fine

States Glee Club Gives Exquisite
Rendition of Indian Songs;
Solos Done Well.

By HAROLD B. HOLST.

The Girls' Glee club, in their con-
cert of last evening, their twenty—
third annual appearance before a
Grinnell audience, reached a peak in
certain phases of performance which
it Will be difficult to surpass.

Director George L. Fierce has not
worked in vain to create a uniformly
Well-balanced tonal ensemble. There
was a beauty of blending in the
voices that at times approached a
timbre suggesting the woodwihds of
the orchestra.

“Night". by Saint—Sachs, with
Decla Wollenweber as soloist, was
given its due as to atmosphere and
shading. 1t,is musical lacework of
delicate texture. and was treated with
all respect for its ﬁnesse of detail
and its subtle nuances.

The quartet composed of the Mis<
ses Urban. Howell, Adams and Thi-
edeman sang in musicianly fashion
three ”Flower Songs" of Mrs. H. A.
A. Beach. and on demand added “The
Year’s at the Spring” by the same
composer.

Indian Songs Fine,

A girls' glee club program is never
complete without fairies in some
guise or other trippi g across the
green, but the fai es in Mabel
Daniels' “Two Songs of Elfland" were
not conventional enough to be unin-
teresting, They had the added an-
vantagc of being ably assisted by
Arline Urban as soloist and Mr. Peck
and his coterie in the orchestra. The
combination of strings and women’s
voices is one that would not suffer
through repetition.

Horace Alden Miller, professor of
composition at Cornell college, re—
ceived able and sympathetic inter—
pretation of his "Kola Wayelo," bas—
ed on Cheyenne and Chippewa
themes. These picturesque episodes
were outwardly accoutred through
conversion of bare stage lnto sylvan
background. The inner spirit had
not been neglected. and here director
and club must be given credit for
some of the ﬁnest work of the even—
ing. The exquisite shadings and
planissimi of the chorus “Dusky
Maid" were experdy handled, and
with sustained mood. Aloha Studier
at the piano provided ample back—
ground in good style.

Soloists Good.

Eunice Cutler contributed to the
enjoyment of the evening through
the medium of Chcpln’s ”Etude in C
Sharp Minor” and the Brahm’s
"Capriccio in B Minor. Arline Ur—
ban. soprano, sing with good style
the Waltz song from “Romeo and Ju—
liet", but it remained for her to con-
tribute a lovely piece of tonal por-
traiture in the Renaldo Hahn "Simes
vers avalent des ailes", which she did
with sure strokes and happy results.

By BETTY COMAN

"It happened just before my fresho
man year at college. That summer
I Worked in a chemical factory with
fourteen hour a day time and only
twelve dollars a week for wages. By
the time I Was through With that
job, I was fully convinced of the fact
that there was something wrong with
Social conditions and proceedings in
the United States. This prompted
me to take up the work that I am
now doing.” Paul Porter, socialist
worker, who has been speaking here
before the Y. w. conference members
and Students of Grinne’ll, was the
speaker. '

"Although,” he continued, "I have
not been in the work long enough to
make comparisons, I have found that
there is no industry in such bad con-
dition as that of textile manufactur—
ing in the south. Here the people
are so oppressed by their employers,
and by their consequent low wages
that their lives are made miserable.

“Because of these things, strikes
have occurred and. hand in hand with
the strikes, the serious problem of
unemployment. The government
should launch policies for the aid of
the unemployment situation. This
could be done by a four-fold plan.
First. it must be estimated as
nearly as possible how many men are
out of work; second. on unemploy-
ment agency. to which all men out of
work could report, would be valu-
able; third, an unemployment insurr

Government Aid Needed for Workers

in Textile Industries, Declares Porter

ance plan must be established: and
fourth, there should be a reserve fund
for hospitals and such necessary in-
stitutions in times of depression.

“In one of my talks yesterday
morning I am afraid that I gave the
impression that conditions in the north
are as bad as those in the south.
This is not true. I merely men-
tioned one place in Iowa city where
a group of girls work all day, in a
damp basement. earning the sum of
three dollars a week. This is simply
one instance. Iowa is one of our best
states socially and economically.

“Since graduating, I have spent
most of my time in work in the south,
where conditions in the textile indus-
try are concemcd. This coming sum-
mer I am going south again for the
purpose of investigating situations in
the tobacco industryiwhich are none
too good. In this latter industry,
where the negro problem is involved
to some extent, the questions in hand
are a little different.

“There is one important factor
necessary to the improvement of the
economic and social situations in the
United States, and that is the interest
and knowledge of the people in the
matter. I have been to ﬁfty colleges
lately, and am greatly pleased to ﬁnd
the enthusiasm displayed by a gndd
many students. It is very evident
that we must turn to the college
students and graduates for help in the
settlement of our social and economic
problems."

College toAllow,
But Not to Favor
Cars, Says Dean

That Grinnell college does not for-
bid men having cars, although the
authorities do not favor them having
automobiles while in residencelherc.
is the text of a letter to parents of
men in attendance at Grihnell sent
this week-end by Shelton L. Beatty,
dean of men.

The importance of students re-
maining in residence, the centering
of social life on the campus, and the
eliminating of accidents are three
points stressed in the letter recom-
mending that parents not permit
their students to have cars.

All cars that are owned by stu—
dents must be registered at the col-
lege treasurers office, and a fee of
one dollar is charged for the registra-
tion. students on probation, or suf-
fering from scholastic difficulties or
