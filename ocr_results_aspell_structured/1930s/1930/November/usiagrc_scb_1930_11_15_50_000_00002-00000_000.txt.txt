THE ELEVENTH GOODrBYE

Grillnell says “good-bye” for the eleventh tilnc
this afternoon to delegates to the annual convention
of the Iowa High School Press association. All at-
tendance of: 276 journalists from 43 Iowa higll
schools has set a new record.

This year's meeting certainly has been the best
in the history of the organization, Some time one
of the representatives here this weekend may re-
turn to Grinllcll as the principal spcakcr of the con-
vention, and relate stirring experiences of diploma
mills, murder investigations, and rum. running—
allotllcr Harry T. Brluldidge,

QUADRANGLE INTRAMUEAL SPIRIT

Are quadrangle intramural athletics a Successfl

It is time the women of Grillnell were asking
themselves this question, The experiment has been
working now for llearly a quarter of a year, and
it is possible to make a deﬁnite estimate of its
effectiveness.

Hockey has been the tcdmspbrt on which cot-
tagc competition has been based, and it is safe to
say that among the women, the proportion of
hockey-bruised shins to stiff muscles gained in
other physical education classes has been greater
than ever before in Grinncll history. Since points
are given for the number of teams from each cot-
tage as well as for the winning team, amateurs
have felt themselves necessary members of some
group instead of shy about displaying their inadcpt-
ness at the game.

All this, of course, makes 'for all increasingly
large number of competent players. The large pro-
portion of women who are playing hockey, together
with the fact that there are six full teams, is really
a res .cctable measure of success for an experiment
just initiated this fall, and seems to justify carry~
ing the system on through the year.

However, there is something lacking ill intra~
mural competition, and that is rivalry. Right now,
only those who are playing the competitive sport
seem to be much interested. To be sure, there are
teams in other sports, but they are not enthusias-
tic. There is not enough rivalry among any of the
teams to interest the “noncombatants.”

No reason can be giv'cn why “there shouldn’t
be strong competition in the quadrangle, because
under the prcscllt system, the good athletes arc
fairly equally distributed among the cottages. What
is necessary, then, is real, whole-hearted pop and
cottage spirit behind the teams. They want to feel
that it makes a difference to someone besides them
selves whether they win or lose.

Thus far the results of inter-cottage competi-
tion have been fairly gratifying, But the real test
is going to come during tllc approaching hockey
matches. The teams which will are going to decide
thesuporiority of some cottages, and the success
of the whole plan. It is the pop behind them that
will make the teams work, and every quadrangle
woman can help create that spirit.

Intramurals can be a success among the women
if there is real competitionx’l‘hcre will be competi-
tion where everyone is intcrcstcd. Let’s see some
cottage spirit in woman’s athletics,

SLEEPING DI CLASS

The Grinncll mall, who has so many admirable
qualities that have been cited and exempliﬁed over
and over, holds courtesy very dear to him. But do
some students occasionally put courtesy from them,
forgetting for the moment that they are the one
ponents of Grinnell?

Truc coultcsy in a mall is admirable. always,
and surely well worth the winning. Courtesy is the
mark of a gentleman, or lady, and the Grillllcll man
is always a gentleman. A first point of courtesy is
respect for ollc’s companion, a true respect for his
intolligcncc and his work. Then isn’t it rude to
ignore one while he is expressing his thought. upon
a subject dear to him, a subject upon which he has
spout hours and days and often many years of
diligent study?

Isn’t it boring to sleep soundly during all-
otllcr’s recital for your express beneﬁt of his
thought?

Gl'illncll professors, ,cacll in their line, have
\VOl‘kOtl well, and they are willing hlld anxious to
present you ill their classes with the fruit of their
study. Isn’t it a point of courtesy to listen to the
speaker just to examine his offering to you, if
nothing more? Surely sleeping is ll professor’s class
is outside the code of a Grinncll gentleman.

WOMEN INDIVIDUALLY RESPONSIBLE

Ill a quadrangle meeting at the beginning of
the year, the league board president outlined the
board’s policy, which may be said to rest ill cmr
phasis on personal judgment and fewer penalties.
The plan has had two months in which to show its
worth.

What is new ill this year’s government? The
change seems to be found not in thc rulcs theur
sclvcs so much as in enforcement. Tllc hours are
not challgcd, but if a woman is late, she is allowed
to explain and the minutes do not accumulate, If
a woman becomes a constant offender or presents
inadequate excuses, she will be called before the
board as ill former ycllrs.

Sigusrup are taken as usual, and the list is left
with the house chairman. The chairman disregards
a failurc to he signed if she knows that the wolllall
is in. If she is uncertain, she asks the woman, and
the whole matter is usually settled without refer-
ence to board meeting.

Tllc Smoking rule is unchanged. The matter of
Sunday dates is to be settled by a vote of the
quadrangle women, but since the warm weather
has lasted, the president has announced each Sull—
rlay that dates will be allowed.

Now one asks, “Ha. it worked?” In comparing
the late arrival lists, it is apparent. that during the
ﬁrst ﬁve minutes after doors closc there are more
women signed than ill the some time last year. But
from that time on the av rage is the same. It would
seem that the board is right. There have been no
women reported as unaccounted for. Since (he rc-
Spollsiblhty for reporting this rests ill tllc judg-
ment of each chairman, speciﬁc comparisons cannot
be made, but the fact that no penalties have been
announced points to tllc success of the extension
of the rule.

Ill the last board meeting it was announced
tlla only one woman has taken advantage of the
p ilcgc as offered this year. Obviously, this year
will not see the last step ill changing the board
from a body of judges to a committee of women,
who are personally entrusted to be spokesmen for
the group. Nor did the year see the ﬁrst step. It
has bccll in process for molly years, and (luring
the second semester of last year practically these
same privileges were given to seniors.

With the advent of house mothers and the new
policy, the quadrangle government has been given
a clcarer form of individual responsibility The
women have accepted it with the spirit in which
it is given, and another step has been accomplished
for thc securing of sclfrgovcrnment.

FUNCTIONS OF THE NEWSPAPER
(From the Detroit News)

“You don't know how to run a campaign,” says a
severe critic of the News. “You boost your own'candi-
date, but you print everything the other candidates say.
If I were running your paper, the opposition wouldn’t
get a line."

Such criticism comes naturally from a partisan who
is convinced that the only object of a political campaign
is the election of his favorite. But he neglects a factor
or two.

First, it newspaper is not a. newspaper unless it
prints the news. And that means all the news, or as
much of the news as space permits. It does not mean
news on one side of a question, but on all sides. It does
not mean news about one candidate, but about all candi-
dates. .
Second, the good newspaper realizes that in a de-
mocracy the will of a majority of the people must pre-
vail. If the majority is controled by the opinion of one
man, or one group of men, to the exclusion of others,
then the majority will not be wise. But if the people
have access to all sides of a question, if it is presented
to them from m'sny points of view, their expressed Opin-
ion nt the polls will be an informed opinion, Tb give
the people all possible accurate information is the only
logitimete function of the news columns of a newspaper
in a democratic land.

This does not mean that the newspaper shall not
have its own opinion on a question, or its own judgment
as to merits of a candidate for ofﬁce duly expressed
in its editorial columns. It has exceptional facilities for
learning the truth about issues and men, on when to
base its recommendations to the public. But a public
which follows the edztortal opinion. without studying the
facts, is not the educated, informed public which Amer-
ica must have if the democratic experiment is to be
the great success we hope it to he.
