Grillllell I'Imilccollling football game last night cer-
tainly helped to instill the old ”Gl‘lllllt’ll spirit”
once more into the scarlet lfllld black Q’I'ILIIIICYI.

Grouped in the north section of tho W ll
ﬁeld stadium at the game, the stlldcnt llmly I'C»
spondcd better to the collage yells than it has at
any time within tho lust three years. When the
team was forced to hold hack the charging of tho
Blucjzlys at the north goal, n tllllndm'ous “hold
that line” greeted eacll Pioneer pin}, from the
west side. Similar liredioalllcllts in the Drake game
at Des Moillcs two weeks ago were Cxllel‘ICllCPd in
silence by the Grillnell rooting section.

Gl-inncll’,‘ \'I(‘IOI‘_V over Creighton and Drake’s
success with \V shillgton last night are ample rer ,
sous why the Pioneer clovon . lolllrl llavc’ continued
support next week. They will travel to St. Louis
Thursday evening to play Washington ill a Mis-

SPOIL THAT HOMECOIVLING
(From the Creightanian)

On Oct, 31 ci-eighton's football team will begin its
campaign for the championship of the Missouri Valley
conference when it meets the Grinnell Pioneers as'lhe
lecture or the latter's Homecoming program. Defeated
in three games out of four already this season, smart-
ing from a defeat at the hands of the Pioneers last year,
and handicapped by some injuries, Coach Srarlr’s ﬁght»
iug band will nevertheless invade the Grinnell strong-
hold cn their Homecoming day determined to begin
that championship campaign with a victoryifor that
is the stuff Stal‘k's men are made of.

The Bluejays back home can play a most potent
part in this important contest. They cannot cheer at the
game, it is true, but they can send their team to the
enemy’s camp \vith an esprit de corps that might well
prove invincible not only to the Pioneers of Grinnell,
but even to the hardy trail-blazers who conquered the
wildernessiforest, river and beast. And this is the spirit
they need, for they will he pitted not against inanimate
natural obstacles nor against dumb animals, but; against
human brain and brawn, which has already proven more
potent in its march to civilization than the most savage
of brutes or the most obstinate of natural barriers.

The cheering for the Grinnell game must he done
on the Creighton campus before Oct. 31; it must he
clone in the classroom, the smoking room, the cafeteria
and the frat house. It must he done not under organ—
ized leadership by cheer-leaders, hut by individual and
unaided effort. A slap on the hack or a punch in the
ribsia “go get 'em” or a “get hot”——these are the
cheer-s that will help to spoil G‘rinuell’s Homecoming.
