the aid of a gift made last fall by
Mr, John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Al-

The foundation is able to make

it has received fits it for this pur-

Train Trip to State College

Interesting to Teget
and Riniker.

(Leta Riniker and Fern Teget
were Gtinnell‘s representatives
at the conference of the inter-
Collegiate Association of Wom-
en Students at Pennsylvania
state college. At the request
of The Grinnell Scarlet and
Black, Miss Riniker has written
an account of the trip to State
College, Pa. Her story is given
below.)

By LETA RINIKER.

Leaving Grinnell Sunday evening,
April 6, Fern Teget and I went to
State College. Pa, to attend the
fourteenth biennial conference of the
Central Section of Intercollegiate
Association of Women Students at
Pennsylvania State college. This
was not as formidable as it sounds
but interesting and enjoyable,

Never having been in the East. we
appreciated the scenery between
Chicago and State College, especially
the “horse-shoe” bend in the Al-
leghenies.

We arrived at our destination on
Wednesday afternoon. The college
is situated in the foothills of the Ap-
palachians, which makesthe campus
picturesque.

ThirtyrFour Schools Represented

One of the features of the trip
was meeting the seventy delegates
who represented thirty-four schools
from various parts of the country.
The majority came from the eastern
states, and a few delegates were
from the South. Representatives
from Minnesota, South Dakota, Wis-
consin and Illinois were also present.
Iowa girls included delegates from
Iowa State, Coe and Grinnell col-
leges. We all stayed in Grange hall,

‘Emotions Play
Upon Voters,’
States Clifton

Political Editor bf Register

Says Intellect Fails

to Control.

Open Dinner Held

Grinnell Sigma Delta Cbi'ObserVes
Founders’. Day Thursday
in Dormitories.

”Emotions control people in elec-
tions, not their intellect," declared
C. C. Clifton, political editor of The
Des Moines Register, in speaking
Thursday evening on “Covering Poll-
tics" at the annual founders' day
dinner of the Grinnell chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi. national journal-
istic fraternity. The meeting was
held in the men’s dining room and
was open to all college men,

“Likewise the lawyer appeals to
the jurymeo on their emotions, not
their intellect." continued Mr. Clif-
ton. In showing how a newspaper
man has to play on emotions, he said,
“I’ve been thrown out of town and
put in jail, and you will too, until
you learn the tricks of the trade. I
got at a judge's emotions by playing
cribbage with him. Cribbage was
dear to that man’s heart. After that
I could sit on the bench with him,
read the paper with him, and smoke
with him.

'Get People Talking‘

“The best thing that can happen
to a politician is to get people talk-
ing about him on the street corn-
ers,” the political writer remarked
in explaining politicians’ passionatc
longing for publicity. “The worst
thing is to be ignored.

“But the man who gives the best
show doesn't always win. Last elec-
tion Al Smith gave by far the best
show. Bryan always gave a good
show,

”Every candidate is an egotist,"
Mr. Clifton told his hearers. “but not
all are politicians. A politician, in
the true sense of the word, is a real
artist who knows how to get what
he wants accomplished. A politician
is spoken of indiscriminately, with
out discriminating between the nob-
lest sense of the word and the dis-
paraging sense. I personally have a
very high respect for the politician,

Politicians Inch Humor

uMany great politicians would lift
a great burden from their shoulders
if -hey had a sense of humor,” ac-
cording to Mr. Clifton. “Newspap-
ers have to serve humorless parties
on both sides of the line. They have
to print everything that comes to
them that is true and fit to print.
even when it is political.

“You can take a map of Iowa and
mark out how lifty counties will go
on any issue," the speaker assured
his audience. "Yet no political writ-
er wants to make a forecast, for that
is the best way to lose your job.

”The press in the United States is
the freest and best in the world, but
it is looking for newer and fresher
blood," the prospective newspaper
men were informed. “If you consid-

Oklahoma A. and M.
Offers Aeronautics

STILLWATER, OKLA.7A two-
ycar aeronautical option will be ofe
fercd to junior students in mechanir
cal engineering at the Oklahoma
Agricultural and Mechanical college
bcgn'nning next September. The
courses will include work in airplane
designing, airplane engine theory
and design, and work on airplane
propellers.

Within the next twenty years,
skillful airplane pilots will be as
common as deft hands with the auto
are 2 today, believes Prof. v. W.
Young, of the engineering School.

“While the transition will not be
as rapid as was the case with the
automobile, the need for- pilot's
schools will largely disappear," dc-
clared Professor Young when com-
menting on the future development
of the aviation industry. “That is
what we mean by ‘airmindedness.’
We become ‘dutomobi'lerninded’ long
ago."

LAWRENCE, KAN. 7 Benny
Douglas, versatile Grinnell track
performer, found himself in fourth
place at the half—way mark in the
decathlon at the Kansas relays Fri-
day night. Wilson "Buster" Charles,
great all-around Indian athlete of
Haskell institute, was leading a
field of twelve entries with a total
of 4185.955 points. He is not only
piling up a tremendous lead but
seems headed for a new decathlon
record.

James Grant, another.Haskell In-
dian, is in second place, while Boyd
of Westminster is third. "Buster"
Charles was the favorite to cop this
ten-event test through having finish-
ed second in the past two years to
Tom Churchill of Oklahoma, who is
not back to defend his title. Robert
Todd of the University of Indiana,
another great all-around athlete and
who was conceded second place, has
met difficulty so far, but may come
up to expectations tomorrow.

Douglas May Puss Boyd

Douglas has garnered a total of
3319.485 points from a third in both
the shot-put and the high-jump,
fourth places in the 100-meter dash
and the broad-jump, and a ﬁfth in
the 400—meter run.

Saturday will see Douglas compet-
ing in the pole-vault, 110rmetef high
hurdles, the discus and javelin throw,
climaxed by the lsoo-meter run.
Douglas is strong in all these events
and will probably pass Boyd to finish
in third place.

The famed Grinnell college relay
team, which includes Capt. Robert
Mark, Dyre Pelletier, Hugh Edwards
and Henry Thomas, will meet some
unusually stiff competition Saturday.
The Pioneers from Iowa performed
for above per in the mile-relay event
in all the contests that they entefu
ed last year, and the race Saturday
is expected to again show the pro-
wess of the Grinnellians.

Stars To Come To Drake

Howard Mcl'lrath, Grinnell distance
runner, will face some of the ﬁnest
distance men in the country Satur-
day. He has already made a name
at Notre Dame, Illinois and Minne-
sota in the long runs.

The Kansas track carnival will
leave heavy rivalry between’ the con-
testants, and the Drake relays next
week are expected to draw most of
the men here Friday and Saturday.

At Drake Johnny Sisk of Mar-
quette is expected to be a worthy
