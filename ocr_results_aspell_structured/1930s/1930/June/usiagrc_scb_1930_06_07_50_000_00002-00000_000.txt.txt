NEW DINNER MUSIC FOR THE MEN.
The melancholy of graduating seniors and the re-

grets of under classmen leaving for three months are
greater this spring. A love for Grinnell has been
established in connection with the special dinner pro-
grams which were given in the quadrangle and dormi-
tory dining rooms.

Special musical programs were provided for the
women before, but a new kind of dinner music was first
furnished for the men Wednesday evening. The pro-

. aged and strengthened the "Grinncll

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

gram given by Miss Leah Pratt, contralto of the
school of music, Aloha Studier, Edward Shadbolt and
Clark 'Bryan was well received. Such a presentation of
semi-popular pieces should have been an object of any
one of the various men's organizations earlier in the
year. Commendation for providing the program is
dlle Shelton L, Beatty, dean of men, ‘

A new Social life was developed among the men
and centered in the dormitory dining room during the
past semester 0n Week-end evenings men were urged to
entertain their lady guests at dinner in the dining
room. A dinner for all Grinncll college men was held
to welcome the new house chairmen and to bid farewell
to the old, Every hall held a dinner, with its respective
freshmen as guests of honor.

Grinnell‘s dormitory system claims distinction for
creating a family spirit among are men. The new social
events of the past year in the dormitories have encour-
spirit.” Grinncll
men of today will always cherish the memories of the
dinner music in the dining room, especially the dliets of
Ernest McIntire and Edward Brown and the solos of
Gene Grounds, and the piano music of Charles Laustrup
and Frank Furbush. ,

Miss Pratt and students of the school of music
gave a different kind of program. Applause showed
the appreciation of the men. '

It is ‘with pleasure that Grinneil men look forward
to returning next fall to hear the new semi-popular
musical programs, which will be offered twice a week,
Wednesday evening and Sunday noon, in the dormitory
dining room. Dean Beatty's idea has received popular

acclaim.

,T’HE CAP BURNING CEREMONY
There was something beautiful about the freshman

cap burning ceremony, with the bonﬁre, the long
shadows, the crowd of expectant faces and the sparks
ﬂying up above the cottonwood tree to light up the sky.
‘ There was also something ridiculously paltry, as
the dignifying rite turned out to consist of a few hard
swats on the backside, and the order to burn the caps,
coming from Honor G men who have a monopoly on
selling new caps next fall.

And there was something extremely cynical about
the preps being commanded to sing their undying love
to old Grinnell as soon as they had got through being
paddled. About the feeble cheer they deemed it wise to
raise to their erstwhile persecutors, and about the even
feebler cheer, which, in belated and unenthusiastic
courtesy, the Honor G returned.

Perhaps if the whole business of making freshmen
into finer and better Grinnellians were'turned over to
a committee of the student council especially selected
for this purpose, the memorable and valuable elements
of the ceremonies could be preserved and those in-
congruous touches, which must make the Martians
sneer, could be eliminated. The formal building dinners

this spring were certainly a step in the right direction,

Special Dispatch. .

DES MOINES.—Grinnell's track
team brought the season to a suc-
cessful close, whcn it earned twenty-
follr points to win third place in the
Iowa State Track meet held here
Saturday night under the lights of
Drake university stadium. The Uni-
versity of Iowa won the meet by ac-
counting for eighty-two points, while
Iowa State college was third with
thirty—four. '

Grinnell athletes won two state
championships when Burt Murray
heaved the discus 132.85 feet for a
dist place, and Howard Mollrath
pulled a surprise by winning the half-
mile run after having turned in a
second place in the mile. His char-
acteristic sprint at the ﬁnish brought
him across the tape in 1 minute 59
7-10 seconds, and enabled him to beat
Skowbo, Iowa’s crack half-miler, by
three yards.

other Grinnell points came when
Steve Kukolich took a second in the
shot, Welter Secor a fourth in the
two-mile event, Henry Thomas a third
place in the quarter-mile dash and
Benny Douglas a second in the
high-jump. The Pioneer mile-relay
team fought Iowa for the lead
throughout the run, but failed to
overtake the record setting quartet
of Beckner, Moulton, Deeping and
Ferguson.
