Critic Believes
Illusions Less

in O’Neill Play

‘Emperor Jones’ Repetition
Reveals Mechanics

of Production.

Lamb Again Intense

Imaginative, Meticulous Direction
of Pryor Dominates Drama;

Phillips’ Accent Good.

By HELEN KINGERY.

To see a play a second time is to
become more conscious of the means
by which it produces its effect, # in
the case of “Emperor Jones," to be
more impressed by the focus of minor
action, setting, and production upon
an atmosphere which makes con-
vlncing the dramatic experience of
the emperor.

The remarkable and terrible actu-
ality which results makes one resent
more highly the long breaks between
acts, the little imperfections in light-
ing and continuity of action. ’Yet in
spite of one's awareness of these, the
illusion of the drama persists, and
the suspense of the negro in the West
Indies jungle is as real the second
time as the first, the braced antici—
pation of pistol shots as rudely shat-
tered by their actual report.

Lamb Sincere.

Again it is difficult to believe that
many amateur college actors achieve
the artistic intensity of Clifton
Lamb. The ordeal of a flight
through an African forest at night
is not one which may be ordinarily
observed in daily life, and convincing-
ly imitated on the stage; to com-
municate the illusion to us the imag—
ination of the actor must go back
to an actual facing of the elemental,
and feel all his civilized cleverness
ineffectual before it.

The awful sincerity with Which Mr.
Lamb endured and fell victim to the
fears of the forest must not have
been easy to experience a second
time, and was not easily shaken off
by the spectator, though one might
admire more dispassionately the in—
tense rhythmic cadence of his voice
and the supple movements of his
body.

Native Attitude Impressive.

The quality of action other than
Mr, Lamb's filled its background
capacity as adequately as before.
Richard Phillips, as Smithers, the
Cockney trader, took his role with a
characteristic assurance and com-
menu of the situation, and with a
delightful Cockney accent. The has
two attitude, implied by the disser-
tations of the emperor and impress-
ed upon us by the continual heat of
the tom—tom. was convincingly inter-
preted by Luella Hall and Russell
Smith, as well as by the band of na—
tive soldiers.

Margaret Napier as the Congo
witch—doctor, the phosphorescent—
jawed crocodile. and the hallucina—
tions of the forest were most effect-
ive when they emerged least from
the Setting, from which the real in-
tensification of Mr. Lamb’s interpre-

al traditions. The group made its
first American appearance in the fall

are all pupils of the old master, Hu-
bay, While Imre Hartman, ’cellist,

a pupil of Popper.

Mr. Schlusnus and Mr. Szigeti have
appeared in Grinnell before, both re-
ceiving commendation as artists of
'ﬁrst rank. The former is at present
the foremost German baritone While
the latter is known as a musican who
expresses his skill by consummate
mastery of his instrument, He is re—
turning for his fifth American tour
and has played with every orchestra
in the East and middle west.

Mr. Zecchi is being announced in
America for the first time. He was
born in Rome in 1904 and studied
under the celebrated Busoni. The
young Italian violinist has played in
all of the great music centers of
Europe and South America, meeting
with a storm of acclaim. Since the
ﬁrst of this year he has toured Italy,

_ Citing the biological interpretation
of life as “the only satisfying philo-

“The science dealing with the

Biologists have known for some time
that a whole is equal to more than
its parts, and that a living whole is
