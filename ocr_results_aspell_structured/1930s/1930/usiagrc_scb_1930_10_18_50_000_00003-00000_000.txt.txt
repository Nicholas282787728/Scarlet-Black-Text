Art Courses

Design No Longer Remote
for Individual, Says
Stemfeld

A new department in the college

signifies Grinnell‘s first venture into
the pragmatic field of art. Edith A
sternfeld and Luella 1. Read are in
charge of the art department. Hither
to there have been classes in art
appreciation instructed by Miss Read,
but no actual laboratory work.

About 30 students are now engag»
ed in classes of drawing and design
Their studio is a large, lighted rooii
on the third floor of the conserve—
tory. The class in play production is
being taught the principles of her-
inony and design in stage settings.

Advertisers Use Art

Miss sternfeirl believes that
change in attitude toward art is the
most significant reason for the cred»
tioii of such a department. Not many
years ago art was only a
classical, remote possibility for tllc
common lot. The individual did not
realize that he was himself a design-
er; that his clothes, his furniture,
the planting of his garden, were the
very essence of art. .

Advertisers make use of this fact
They recognize art as a living force,
not a mere relic of the past. The
young children of this generation
will he the connoisseurs of the next,
for they are being taught art with
intent toward usefulness instead of
amusement Since this is so, they
will not permit the gross inade-
ouacies, the utter ignorance of line
and contour which exist in so many
forms today.

Plan Exlii tion

The department will probably offer
a course in interior decorating next
semester. Although no date has
been set, exhibitions will be given in
the recreation room of the little thea-
ter at some future time.

An attempt is being made to stuns
dardize the course so that it will
comprise the requirements of other
colleges offering such a curriculum.
A comprehensive study must combine
the essentials of art with those of
education.

i Campus Opinion

Would you approve or .i mild form
of “propping" freshmen “0|“ch

Lorry Monger: I think it would be
hind of fun.

Marion Johnson: Absolutely not at
all. -

Hubui-t rye: No, because preppcrs
do not use good judgment.

Min-ion Frederichson: No, it would
result in too many homesick fresh
nien and tend to do away with the
Gi ell spirit.

ziibclh Cook: I do not approve
of any kind of prepping because it
makes freshmen antagonistic to up-
per classmen.

enrol GﬂAVU up: No, it causes class
prejudice and is undlgnlﬁed and too
crude.

Louis Bftth: Very good idea. There
11'e plenty of them that need that
“I love me" idea taken out of them

Geneva Sayre: It doesn't make any
difference.

Plans for intramural athletic com»
petition between the cottages in the
quadrangle are well under way. All
the hockey teams have been on the
ﬁeld for two or more practices, and
women are busy on the tennis courts
and at target practice.

Drawings have been made for the
tennis tournament which will begin
this week. The hockey games are
scheduled to take place early in No-
vember.

The women's Forensic society pro~
gram Monday was the ﬁrst of a ser-
ies of six programs on literary sub-
jects. Rolvaag was the subject of this
meeting.

Doris Long reviewed his life, and
Arline Cale reviewed “Giants in the
Earth” and "Pure Gold." Marguerite
McFarlin read'somc Short selections
from “Giantsin the Earth."

Play day, an innovation in the
Women’s athletic program on the
campus, was ﬁrst held Saturday
morning when a large group of wom-
en met on the hockey field to play for
play's sake.

The games were in charge of the
members of the theory of coaching
class. Newcomb, volleyball, tennis,
and other group games were played.
Play days are growing in popularity
on the campusesxof all the American
colleges and universities. They pro-
mote the theory of coinradeship and
sportsmanship in games instead of
the old “play to win” idea.
