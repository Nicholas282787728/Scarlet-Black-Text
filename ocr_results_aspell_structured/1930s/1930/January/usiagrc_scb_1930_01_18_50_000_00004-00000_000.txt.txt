nrath, rye, and McKensey are work-
ing on the mile run, and Secor on
the (wermile. The last four show-
ed up well this fall on the undefeat-
ed cross—country team,

Hensley and Murray, two veterans,
are at work on the hurdles. Hensley
and Green will probably take places
in the pole vault, and Murray and
Welton are at work on the high
jump, Gerhardt and Thomas are
both new men on the broad jump.

Kukolich and Murray have both ‘

seen competition in the shot—put,
while Bilto, although he has not had
a great deal of experience, placed
high in the last intramural meet.
and is showing unusual ability in
the daily workouts. Rose is also ex-
pected to break into the ranks of
shot-putters this year.
Valley Competition Keen

The outlook for a better showing
in the triangular than last year is
not bright. The squad is weakened
by the loss of Taylor who took a
large section of the polnts last year
and McKee and McCully who also
graduated and Douglas who will not
get into the indoor meets. The
squad will be a little stronger in the
distances but not be the same strong
allearound team that it was last year.

Missouri Valley competition will
be keen this year with the return of
lettermen to all the squads. The
Oklahoma Aggies who were winners
of the outdoor Valley meet and sec-
ond in the indoor have nine lettermen
back with the addition of an under
fasted freshman squad.

Drake, whom Grinnell will run up
against six times on the schedule,
will be strong in the distances and
sprints. McWhinney will again run
the (wermile, and in the half, Gordon,
last year's Valley winner, and
Stevens, will probably make points
again this year, Snorf, who was
not in competition last year is rated
as one of the best sprinters and
hurdlers in the Valley. -

Washington Strong

Not so much hasv been heard of
Creighton. Reed and Baron will
probably go well in the short sprints,
and Binder in the mile.

Washington is strong
events with the return of
good men in shotrput, jumps, and
pole yault. Glaser, Miller, Paris.
Weber, and Timberlake will all be
likely opponents.

Following the triangular at
Drake. the Pioneers will return to
Drake the following Saturday for a
dual with the Bulldogs, and again on
March 1 for the Missouri Valley in-
door meet, which Grinnell took last
year. The nlinois relays on March
15 are next on the schedule, and will
end the indoor season.

The st. Louis aggregation contin-
ued their heavy bombardment in the
second half, and before the period
was many minutes old, the count
stood 32'16, Crinnell's four additional
points being due to Wilhelm’s two
baskets. From this time to the end
of the game, Washington scored at

College Revue

(Continued From Page 1) ‘

The Pioneer Pnldltles, Since thelr
founding two years ago, have been
sponsored by the Grinnell chapter of
Sigma Delta chi, national honorary
professional journalistic fraternity.
However the production this season
Will be in the hands of both Sigma
Delta Chi and the Grinnell chapter
of the National Collegiate Players
association, The Prudities program
heretofore consisted of six skits,
which generally were made up of
musical numbers and drama scenes,‘
This year's production will also be
composed of the same type of enter-
tainmeut, although a. preview of the
six acts will be held in February be-l
for the Dramatic Council of Grin-
nell College, which is to determine
their originality and quality, and it
may eliminate some from the final
show. |

Drawings Are Held I

House chairmen or representatives
of all six Cottages and dormitoi'y‘
hulls met together With the Prudities‘
committees of Sigma Delta Chi and
the National Collegiate players and
Mrs, Sara Sherman Pryor, director
of dramatics, in the experimental‘
theatre room of the Alumni Recita-l
tron hall last Wednesday night for,
the Prudities drawing.

Katherine Gillespie, Doris McCorr
Hack, Gertrude Stevens, Eva, Adams.
Geraldine Brinkmall and Vivian
Fanshcr were present from the
quadrangle. The dormitories were
represented by Davis Greene, Donri
old Jones Ernest McIntire, Donald
Goodman, William Schmadecke and
Edward Brown, Donald Rutherford,
Edward Allen and Robert Stevenson
made up the committee from Sigma
Delta Chi and Margaret Napier,
Henry Bray, Richard Phillips and
Russell Peterson composed the one
from the National Collegiate Play-
ers.

The judge for the event will be
selected by the joint committee of
the two groups sponsoring the pro-
duction. Wayne Weishaar was
judge two years ago and Harlan Mill-
er selected the winners last year.

fair to John Sebastian to have his
work brought into contrast with the
vibrant Italian work.

The closing group included Rim-
sky-Korsskoff's “Song of India," an
Allegro by Sanaine, a “Song Witbs
out Words" by Mendelssohn and a
Moszowski “Tarantella," After
these numbers an insistant encore
persuaded Piatigorsky to add two
extra numbcrs the ”Guitarre" by
Moszkowski and and "Valse Senti-
mentale" by Tchaikovsky,

The accompanist of the evening.
Valentine Paviovsky, supplied a fine
support for the soloist. Throughout
the concert there was never a mom-
ent in which the ’cellist and his ac-
companist were not in absolute ac-
cord. Not a little of the success of
the concert was due to the instru»
ment on which the artist plays: a
Stradivarius, violincello, made two
centuries ago. This particular in
strument is one of the finest of the
fifty or so in existence; it was fore

imerly in the Mendelssohn Collection

in Berlin, and was
Piatigorsky.

Once again we congratulate Mr.
George L. Pierce, director of the
Grinnell School of Music, on the
presenting.
Through this series we are enabled
to hear the most eminent of artists
under ideal accoustical and aesthetic
surroundings.
