Paris University, Labrador Schooner
Homes of De Wind Brothers for Year

No Cut System at French
School, Adrian Reports;

Lalmador Flies ‘Fierce'

After a year spent in foreign
lands, two Gates hall brothers from
Newton, 1a., recnterod Grinncll col-
lege this fall.

Adrian De Wind, senior. completed
his junior year’s work at the Univer-
sity of Paris, after studying several
months at the University of Poitiers
at TDHI‘S.

Norman De Wind. sophomore,
worked on the crew of a Labrador
fishing schooner, and in several of
the Crenfell Mission hospitals.

No Cuts

A “cut" system simply_does not
exist at the University of Par-is, Ad»
rian points out. Attendance at classes
is purely voluntary. The lecture sys-
tem is used, and at the end of the
semester oral and written examina-
tions are given, upon which the grade
for the whole years work depends.
Entrance cards resembling tickets
admit students to classes, which con»
tain from 250 to 300 persons.

It is possible to register, without
attending a single class during the
year, and yet receive full credit for
the course if the examination is
passed satisfactorily, De Wind said.

"Organized athletics have no place
in the French university. Many stu-
dents belong to athletic clubs which
sponsor systems of contests, but they
have no connection with the univer-
sity program."

"Due to their spirit of individuality.
French students prefer living in pri—
vate rooms instead of club and dormi—
tory life. Social fratern' ies and
dormitories do not exist," Adrian de-
dared,

De Wi d continued courses in his-
tory, pol ical science, and French
literature in Paris. Besides living a

rning team next year. Although only

Those announced by Dave Mal-
brough as reporting at the present

Minneapolis, Minn, breast stroke
and diver; Loren Lindquist, Minnea—

CONAitD T0 SPEAK

address.

 

year in Erance, he spent a week in
Italy and almost a month in England.
Lives on Schooner

A tweemaster fishing schooner
with a Crew of seven was the home
of Norman Dc Wind during part of
one summer of the year he spent in
Labrador. Later he worked in Her-
rington hospital, assisting in the op-
erating room for part of the time.
He also worked an. other hospital

missions maintained by the Inter,

national Grenfeu association.

Winters in which the temperature
goes to 60 degrees below zero, and
moderate summers when the flies and
mosquitoes are “fierce" characterize
the climate, according to Norman.

Flies Are Menace

“The entire population of Labra-
dor lives on the rocky trcelcss coast
during the summer, to avoid the flies
and to be near the fishing grounds,
In the winter they move into the line
terior to be near firewood. Coal is
scarce and costs 550 a top.

“All transportation is carried on
by boat in summer and by do’g team
in winter. There are no roads," Ad~
rian reported

“In order to be near the fishing,
the entire population is scattered in
very small groups along the coast.
The largest 'city' is populated by 60
or 70 families."

A cruise with Sir Wilfred Grehfell,
founder of the Grcnfell missions in
Labrador, on his private yacht was a
part of De Wind’s experience.

Season Tickets
to Include Five
Drama Projects

Season tickets tor the five major
productions, which the Grinnell col-
lege drama department will present
this year, will be issued soon, it was
announced today by Mrs. Sara Sher-
man Pryor, director of drama.

The tickets, according to Robert
Polachek. business manager of the
homecoming play, will enable stu-
dents to attend each production at a
much lower cost than has previously
been possible; however, “These tick-
ets must be purchased before the first
performance," stated Pclacbek.

Modernistic sets for the homecom»
ing comedy, “Meet the Wife", are
being constructed by the painting
crew in the workshop of the drama
department, and the cast is holding
regular practices under the direction
of Mrs. Pryor.

Library of Gales Hall
to C ontain Periddicals

The Gates hall library will contain
periodicals and daily newspapers in-
stead of books as in the other halls,
because of the fact that there is no
extra room in the hall to use as a
library.

According to Robinson Shoulberg,
house president, this current litera—
ture library will be installed in the
club room, the men having voted to
spend some of the building funds for
this project. Periodicals to be sub-
scribed for by the hall arc Harpers,
cosmopolitan, Time, and Life.

Atlantic Monthly, National Geo-
graphic, ond The Christian Science
Monitor are being donated, and the
subscription list will also include The
New York Times, and a wcstcrn and
southern newspaper.

"It is hoped that this new project
will givc the men a broad conception
of national and world developments,
and will provide thorn with an op-
portunity for more constructive
reading and thinking,” stated Shoul—
berg.

SENIORS To ELECT

The class of 1934 will meet in the
