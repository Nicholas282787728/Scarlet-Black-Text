NoIIen To Go

I To Conven’rion

First Gi'innellian
To Register for
Stewards’ Meeting

Pros, John S. Nollen is among the
first from Grinnell to register for
the National Stewardship convene
tion to be held at the Stevens
Hotel, Chicago, ill, Nov. 1 to 3.

“Stewardship in Democracy” is
the convention theme,

The convention hopes to unite
the nation’s forces to meet the
present-day sweep of materialism
and religious prejudice and to mo-
bilize greater spiritual and finan—
cial strength in support of church—
es, Welfare and character-building
organizations.

Morning and evening sessions
will be addressed by Protestants,
Jews and Catholics or national
importance.

Morning sessions will chiefly
be devoted to reports of commite
tees which have made surveys of
privately-endowed and church re-
lated institutions,

The convention is sponsored by
the National Committee for Reli—
gion and Welfare Recovery, which
is composed of 600 church men
and educators.

for the small colleges is far from
a profitable sport, Oberlin Col-
lege's Pres, Ernest H. Wilkins re
ports after a cndstrtoccoast survey
of the financing of the gridiron
sport.

Quoting figures that deny the
fact that “football supports the
rest of the athletic program,"
Pres. Wilkins states that in the
22 colleges he surveyed an aver—
age deficit of $1,743 resulted from
last year's football Schedule.

Total receipts ranged from 32,»
660 to $16,213, he reported, but
expenditures ranged from $3,825
to $18,050. Just two of the 22
show a surplus at the end of the
season, and one of these Was for
only $79. Deficits revealed were
as high as 35,530.

RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Clark smith

It hasn’t been released as yet, but
Gl'innell’s 1939 football schedule is
going to be duitc an attraction.
Games have been booked with
five Midwest conference teams,
which is another factor that
points toward certain entrance in
that organization. Pres, John s,
Nollen admits that joining the
Midwest seems to be the most
logical thing for Grinnell.

St. Louis’ season record to date
is not very impressive, but in
comparing it with Gl'innell's, the
quality of opposition must be tak-
en into consideration. Even so.

he did last year. On one week

wrestled in his weight division for

with that, “Robby" also played in
