Possibly it's the approaching
Homecoming which is causing all
the trouble, or it may just be the
normal state of affairs, but at
any rate the athletic department
for the past few weeks seems to
have been gripped by an attack
of insanity.

by the way) hids fair_ to he-
come a Grinnell classic.

And not to be outdone, Roy

With the start or swimming

getting more than a little worried
about George cisar, who would be
