Sophomores

Win Meet

Two Upperclasses Fail
lo Enter Swimmers

The annual lliferrclass swimming:
meet became a duel between the:
freshmen and sophomores Tuesday!
when the two upper classes failed-
to enter teams in the competition.-
As a result the final events were.
held yesterday instead of Thursday
as planned, and the sophomores
emerged victorious by a score of
43-32.

Harry Harvey. frosh driver.
upset the dope bucket when he
nosed out Boyd Burcbai-d for first
place in his favorite event by 25-
hundredths of a point, Bur-chard
was ahead until his last optional
dive which he spoiled by hitting the
water out of‘pos‘ition.

Voss High Point Man

Erik Voss, prep aplasher, was
high point man of the meet with
11 points. Earl Melgard, sopho-
more, followed with nine. while
George Holcomb, also a second
year man, secured third position
with seven points. Each team gab
nei-ed tour first places, but the up-
per-classmcn grahbed more seconds
and thirds.

The closest race of the afternoon
occurred in the 160 yard relay when
Voss came from behind and almost
caught the sophomore anchor man,
Melgard, but lacked a second of
doing so. Voss easily won his two
individual events, the so yard and
100 yard freestyle. and he coasted
through both events just fast
enough to win.
