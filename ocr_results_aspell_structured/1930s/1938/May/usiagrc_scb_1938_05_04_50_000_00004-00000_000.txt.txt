HERE'S YOUR CHANCE

This afternoon begins on this campus
the second anmlal conference on vocations
at which time students will have an oppor-
tunity to learn about eight fields of activity
from distinguished leaders in these fields.

The program, beginning this afternoon
with a series of lectures in the Alumni Re-
citation hall auditorium, includes discussions
on business, art, radio, journalism, home
economics, social administration, public ser-
vice, and related studies in lav and science
in industry.

Here, indeed, is a chance for students,
whether they be freshmen planning their
colle 'e careers, sophomores or juniors
training for business and professional life,
or seniors on the threshold of going out to
look for the job, to learn from leaders in
the field just what they must do and ex-
pect if they are to be successful.

As we said, this is a real opportunity,
one that you cannot, if you are awake to
what is going on about you, afford to miss.
Time taken for participation in this con—
ference will pay big‘ dividends in the long
l'llnf

IT'S UP TO YOU

Plans for the publication of a senior
annual by the incoming- Junior class have
come upon unexpected difficulties ill the
form of what we consider unwarranted
opposition by certain members of the ad-
ministration to the suggested means of fi-
nancing the publication

Under the proposed plan the annual
would have been financed by funds taken
from the room deposit of each individual
in school, in return for which each student
would have received a copy of the annual
by paying an additional $2. Such a plan is
similar to that used by at least 14 other

institutions of higher education in this
state, where all annual is financed out of
sclncstcr fcc funds and the like. Those
oppo ng the plan say that it would not be
fair to “impose a charge on the clitire stu-
dent body for a book which only a portion
of them will be willing to buy.”

0n the contrary, we believe that every
student in school wants all annual and would
favor such a painless way of buying one.

Then, it is suggested that most stu—
dents use up their room deposit before the
cnd of the year and hence such a plan
would icccessitatc collections by the busi-
ness of cc to balance the books. We be-
lieve this problem would be so minor that
it can be eliminated from consideration at
the present time.

The incoming Junior class has drawn
up specifications for an animal of at least
1’76 pages, with 32 twoscolor pages, leather
bound and using engravings in place of
half tones. Such a book would be a credit
to Grinnell and of value to every student.
The financing plan as originally worked out
provided a painless way to provide such a
book to all students. If it is turned down
the whole future of the project is doubtful.

ll‘ Grinnell students want all annual,
now is the time to do something about it.
An aroused studcnt consciousness can carry
the issue. Wc for our part will do all we
can, The rest is up to YOU.

A GALA OCCASIO

Event of the week on the social
calendar is the annual Brown Derby drag
and sweepstakes, sponsored by Sigma Delta
Chi, and foremost event of the drag will be
the usual list of humorous awardsl

These in particular have become an in-
stitution on this campus, and nearly every-
one, secretly fearful, or otherwise, that he
or she may colne iu for mention, eagerly
awaits the announcement of winners. This
year, too, the journalists have engaged an
orchestra of a calibre seldom before heard
on this campus.

All ill all Saturday should be a gala

occasion, with a bevy of beauties entered in'

th sweepstakes Saturday morning and an
e ceptichal program planned [or Saturday

Saturday at . noon the Honor ”G”
club is sponsoring its animal intcrscholastic
track and field meet here. This event re-
gularly dra s entrants from high Schools
in all pal s ol‘ the state. This year will be
no exception.

Which, of course, means two things to
Grinncll and Grinncll students. In the first
place, this event will be of intcrest to any-
one interested ill track. Here Saturday
many of the outstanding iowa high school
stars will compete, and that means a fast
and up to the minute meet. It is not in-
conceivable that some records may fall,
probably not in the number they did at the
Drake'relays last week, but still the high
school teams are doing all right this year,
and ill track you never can tell.

Perhaps morc ilnpor mt, at least from
the standpoint of theschool is the fact that
this meet u ill bring to the campus a number
of prospective students, mostly athletes. It
is, therefore, of the utmost importance that
Grinnell college and Grinncll life appeal to
them. Every Grinnell man and woman can
help by remembering the much talked of
Gl‘imlell spirit, and, if necessary, going just
a little out of the way to be friendly to the
Visitors. Such an attempt will more than
pay dividends in increased good will.

WEDNESDAY,

DORIC ‘

The annual Derby Doric!

h-hner lilsl your un-iuu 01 the
blanket to Richard Moore, we
have been informed that Langalrs
corpuldnt Casanova, Bill Tinsley,
felt he should have had the
award.

while speaking about previous
winners, some of this year's
senieis still recall that so far
in the history of the derby only
one person has been twortimc
winner of the rabblts. The personv
so honored was a jellnc fillo and
she won it each year with a dif-
fercnt fellow as partner} There
are some who maintain that Bar-
nett could equal that record were
it not for the fact that he is
retiring president of Sigma Delta
cm and in a position to influence
the decision.

Among the outstanding
candidates being
each hall are the followmg:
Smithi Moor Langanﬁ Liver-
more: Kellyithcy say everybody
there stlldles; GatcsiM. Smith;
Clark-eName any Senior In the
hall and you can’t go wrong;

Suggestions tor the mystery
award have been numerous. The
more popular include (1) a nu-
mclal sweater with the llumelals
“32" on it for “Bud" Pedelsen
lsuggested by the Student Colin-
cill: (2) a fitting reply for Beth
Pcllnock to make to one of the
Smith boy: when he accuses her
of putting her pin on Berg 05—

to the brown derby for the fac-
ulty member getting through coir

At any rate, the derby's m.c.
