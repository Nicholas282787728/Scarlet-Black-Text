'Reii' Rumors

State Legislatures
Jump to investigate
Communist Activities

LAWRENCE, KANS.7(ACP)
state legislators, controllers of
funds that support state colleges
and universities, are not often
concerned with the subject-mat—
ter taught in these institutionsi
but let somebody whisper “com-
munism," and the investigation
is on.

Must noted for its redsherl-ing
career before its legislature is
VViscousin’s famed state \inivel's
sity in Madison. However. latest
university to grab the glare of
legislative seai-chhglits is the
University of Kansas, alma mater
of Republican Alf M. London's
daughter, Peggy.

It all staited when Don Henry,
a young student, enlisted in the
loyalist army in Spain, was killed
in action At the time of his
death it was reported he had
joined the Spanish for-cos because
of red doctrines taught him while
a student.

Now the state legislature has
appropriated $7,500 to investigate
these charges, causing faculty
members and students to first
lampoon the act, their settle
down to await the inquiry that is
certain to do the name of the
university little good, no matter
what results are reported by the
committee.

“The matter is now entirely up

'to the students,“ Miss Kolyn said.

“The executive committee of the
class believes that the room de-
posit plan is the only possible
means of financing the pubiic’ds
tion.

Must Favor Ylan

“Therefore, unless the students
favor the present plan, it is very
doubtful that we will publish an
annual next spring."

Plans of the class have been

approved by the student council
and the League Board, thus add»
ing further strength to the propo-
sition, she stated.
‘Results of the petitions, voted
upon by the students at the spe-
cial chapel on the year boukMolis
day and at house meetings that
night, showed that 470 students
will support the sophomore class
in its plans.

Former Annuals Cheapeired

.At chapel Monday morning,

'John Spence, former president of

the student Council, spoke on the
needs of a year book.

He pointed out that,'up to the
school year 1934735, Grinncll had
excellent annuals. That year, he
said, the year book didn't live up
to former years because it was
cheapeiicd by money-making
schemes of the staff. This made
students skeptical of an annual
and spoiled later effoits to pubs
Tish one.

Three Things Needed

“Three things are
give Grinncll a good annual," he
stated. "First, a practical ﬁnaru
oial plan; second, support of the
student body; and third, at l'espmis
siblc organization to sponsor it."

Concluding, he asserted that the
sophomore class has done more
in three months toward an ans
nunl than has been done by any-
onc else in three years. and that
he believed they should he sup-
ported in their proposition,

NEW YORK CITYitACPli
The average U. 3, college student
loses two pounds during examina-
tion periods.

This figure has been determined
here by the Bureau of Educational
Surveys, which estimates that 90
per cent of the aveiage student
body crams during examinations

According to the bureau, which
bases its findings on a survey of
colleges throughout the country,
some of the faults in instruction
which can confuse the students
and make comprehension of the
course faulty, with a necessity for
last minute cramming, include
failure to give a comprehensive
overview of the whole course; fail-
urc to present the material in
clear outline form; the use of
words not readily understandable
by the average student; and lack
of continuity arid organization in
textbooks.
