SWAN SONG

Today that darned song, “Thanks for
the Memory,” keeps running through our
collective head . . . . ”Thanks for the memory
. ..You might have been a headache...
But you never were a bore.”

The reason is obvious to us. This is the
last issue of THE SCARLET AND BLACK
to appear under our management. After a
year of sleepless Tuesday and Friday eve—
nings . . . . a year of Complaints from people
who didn’t receive their S. & B‘s . . . a year
of griping about stories that weren’t print,
ed, it is interesting to reminisce and ration-
alize. Part of the errors of the past year
have been our fault, part the result of lack
of cooperation, part due to misunderstand
mg.

Being in a benevolent mood this
afternoon, we should beg the indulgences of
those whom we have offended...and are
also agreeable to reciprocity on the above
account. Beginning tomorrow, we shall
sink back into oblivion to lead the life of
Riley. We, too, shall wait, wonder, and beef
about that rag, THE SCARLET AND
BLACK (Not that we haven’t “beefed"
about the darned paper this year. . . ask the
Student Councilibut it’ll be different from
n'ow on.) ‘

So we sing our swan songimerrily, al~
though not without some pleasant memories.
We do sincerely hope that the new manage-
ment will have as pleasant a year as we’ve
had, as great harmony on the staff, and as
much cooperation from other campus or-
ganizations, as we’ve had. THE SCARLET
AND BLACK can be made a truly fine
newspaper. The new management has the
ability, if they receive the suppolt. And
yet, as we look back over the past year and
see the new men plunging optimistically
into the job before them we congratulate
them, and to ourselves murmur: “Forgive
them, for they know not what they do.”

Stephen Cogswcil, Managing Editor.
Robert Schutt, Business Manager.

AN IMPORTANT CHOICE

Tomorrow night the men and women
of Grinnell will nominate candidates for the
important position of Student Council we
sident.

The importance of this selection can
not be overestimated. As has been ably
demonstrated this year, the president of
this group, working with capable student
representatives, can accomplish a great deal
that is of value to Grinncll.

Ii. is hoped that students will accept

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the responsibility resting upon themat this
time, by recommending to the Student
Council candidates who are fitted to carry
on the important work devolving on the
head of the student governing agency.

NEW INCENTIVES GW

Under the new financial setup for the
Scarlet and Black, approved by the pub1i<
cations board Monday, certain changes were
made which are of interest f0' the effect
they will have on the future of journalism
on this campus.

In brief, these changes provide a redisr
tribution of profits and the addition of three
salaried positions in the administration of
the paper.

Under the old setup, under which only
the editor and business manager received
salaries, other members of the staff had
little incentive to devote hours to work on
the paper with slight hope of even eventual
financial reward.

With the addition of these new posi-
tions it will‘ be possible for students who
work concientiously on the paper to be
assured of remuneration for their services
at some time in their college career.

SMALL THINGS MAR THE WHOLE

We are fortunate on this campus to
have as a regular part of the music depart»
ment curriculum a series of public recitals
by seniors in the department.

Without exception, these recitals are
of high calibre, both in content and pre-
sentation. It is because of the uniformly
good quality of these recitals that we beg
leave to criticize.

Would it be too much to ask that the
Grinllell college symphony orchestra, when
called upon to participate in a recital as
they were Monday, would follow the example
of other musical organizations as well as the
artist whom they are aiding, and appear in
formal dress.

Admittedly this is a small matter, yet
we believe worthy of consideration for it is
just such things that mar the perfection of
the whole.

is—
SPRING AND - 0R VESPERS

Now that spring is literally upon us, it
is in accord with past experience to assume
that chapel, and more especially Vesper ser-
vices, will begin more and more to suffer
from lack of attendence.

' Such a situation is to us regrettable.

However, being human, we can ulld
stand how the lure of spring weather can
easily overpower the most faithful. To say
nothing of the fact that “in the spring a
young man’s fancy” doesn't turn to thoughts
of chapel or vespErs.

Suggestions are always easily come by
and often hard to carry ollt but we do think
a certain revival of interest in these services
might result if they were to be conducted
out of doors.

Also we would suggest that the Vesper
be shortened wherever possible.

Loss of the organ and lack of a very
suitable location f ' such a service a e, we
admi , serious (1 ficulties, bllt not insur-
mountable.

WHO WANTS $25?

To date there have been no entries in
the freshman song contest in which a prize
of $25 is offered by Dr, Edward A. Steiner
to the freshman writing the best song for
his class and college.

Personally we are considering reverting
to our childhood days so that we may again
become freshman and win the money,

From a purely business standpoint we
should think some prep would see possibili-
tics in this contest. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time in the his-
tory of capitalist America that no one has
even tried to win a $25 prize.

Seriously, however there is still time
before May l, for entries to be submitted.
As we have pointed out before such a song
would be a worthwhile addition to the Grin-
nell tradition.
