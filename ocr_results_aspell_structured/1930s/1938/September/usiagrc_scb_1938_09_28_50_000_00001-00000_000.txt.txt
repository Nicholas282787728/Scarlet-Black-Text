Lookabaugh
Worried By
Backfield

Coach Eyes Nash,
Walters to Fill
Halfback Spot

By Edward Wilson

Finding a backfield combination
to replace the one broken up be»
cause of an injury to Fred Luther
in the Cornell game Friday, is
the chief worry of Coach Guy
Lookahaugh whose Pioneers face
State Twhers college at Cedar
Falls Saturday.

General admission to the game
will be $1.10, but Grinnell students
with semester fee tickets will be
admitted for 50 cents plus tax.

Luther Out~

Lookabaugb was well pleased
with the showing made by the
Pioneers in their opening tilt, but
nevertheless he found that work
was needed in several departments
of play.

Luther's assignment will proh-
ahly fall either to Jim Nash or
Ed Walters. Nash. a junior, was
a key- men on the freshman team
of two years ago, but was kept
from competition most of last

year with a bad leg. He is exper-
iyenced, shifty and a good ball
handler

Walters, on the other hand, has

himself in a creditable fashion
against Cornell and has looked

Insect Invasion
01‘ Campus Calls
For Meyers Plan

P. P. Meyers, the man who ap-
plies science to the riddance of
various forms of pests, such as
blackbirds, is going to have to
try a new angle.

Yes, it is true that the black—
birds left after they learned they
could no longer be an annoyance,
but when the biackbirds went out,
a new problem came mimosqult-
oes.

Doubtless, the birds were a
bother, but compared to the mos-
quitoes, they were sissies. The
only way the birds could annoy
one was when you were walking
under a tree. But these insects
have no sense of justice!

At night they roam around
Ward field, the tracks, the ho-
tony gardens, and cause no end
of embarrassment.

Two people on a blanket, a
slight buzz is heard. followed by
a lusty stab from the mosquito.

Until Meyers comes to the res»
cue with another startling inven-
tion, all that can be done is to
buy mosquito netting, but better
buy early and avoid the rush.
Meyers, when you eradicate the
mosquito, don't bring on the bed
bug!

The average midwesterner

For Future Characterization

of cotton fields.

The far west with its twang,
the north with its hardness. the
east with its nasality all contri-
bute to the colorful fabric of
American speech, Mrs, Pryor
asserted.

Each dialect has its merits and
discrepancies; most of the latter,
however, arise form faulty pro»
nunciation, Mrs. Pryor declared.

Ideal speech is based upon cor-
rectly pronounced words, colored
by the native intonation of the
part of the country from which
one comes.

An actor, to be successful, must
not only have mastered the best
speech of his own locality, but
must be familiar with the dialects
of all sections, Mrs. Pryor said.
