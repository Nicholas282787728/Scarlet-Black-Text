RANDOM
SPORT SHOTS

By Edward Wilson‘—
Grinnell minor sports tennis
have bright outlooks so rarely
that ’ivhen such occasions present
themselves it is to the advantage
of the college to help that team
as much as possible.

This season should be the host
in many moons for the Grinnell
tennis team. It has been building
up to a climax for tour years.
Last year's team which lost only
to Iowa, is back for this year's
play with notable remfol'ccments.
Looking torward to a banner sea—
son. the team deserves all the
support we can give it.

The netmen have trouble get-
ting in early practice and
throughout the season weather
conditions stymie them. It is a
known tact that the men’s tennis
courts are not very good, re-
gardless of effort to recondi on
them. Therefore, it is our opinion
that the local varsity racqueteers
be permitted to muscle in for un-
limited use of the women’s courts.

That neiv tackling dummy with
horizontal stripes that has been
installed in the corner of Mac-

has been noticeable in former
years, but the new dummy should
polish off the squad's blocking
and tackling.

layoff, due to the weather, prac-
tice was resumed Monday with
only 22 men reporting for action.
Only nine freshmen are reporting

and this is the big disappoint- situation is worse than over this time in many years that a Grin-

ment. Thirteen lettermen were
lost by graduation; and, according
to past experience, it is desirable
to have at least two new men
reporting for every man lost to
the squad. While this always
