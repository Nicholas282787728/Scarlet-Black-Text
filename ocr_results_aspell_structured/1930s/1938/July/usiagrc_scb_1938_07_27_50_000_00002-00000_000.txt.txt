competition.

Although a very small squad
reported regularly for drills last
spi g. Lookabough expects a
nearly average squad to be on
hand when practice gets under
way this fall. All indications point
to the fact that Grinneli's attack
is to be speeded up this fall. as
much time was spent on speed
plays last spring. with [unda-
inentals and speed stressed in the
spring drills, the Pioneer mentor
has his squad fairly well drilled
in the type of football he expects
to employ this year.

Returning lettei-incn are Captain

Kicking and passing duties are
expected to fall on Fred Homaun,

The backfield will probably be
