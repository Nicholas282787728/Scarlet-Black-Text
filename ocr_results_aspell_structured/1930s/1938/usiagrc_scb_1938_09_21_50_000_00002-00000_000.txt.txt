Rube Goldberg
Method Used on
Bird Problem!

The bird problem with which
Grinneliians must contend every
{all is about 1.0 be solved by use
of what Sounds to he a Rube
Goldberg method!

(A) Cut the inside limbs off the
trees. (8) Don't cut out the
limbs near the erQEt. Let the
trees grow to the outside of the
walks and attract (C) the birds
who can proceed to roost in peace.
Thus the shade is preserved with-
out having to beware of the
feathered friends.

A system of lighting similar to
that used on Ward field will be
installed near the trees to make
the birds think that the sun is
still shining, necessitating their
looking for worms.

This will leave the students free
from [ear of air raids.
