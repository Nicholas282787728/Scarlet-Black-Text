The Pittsburgh society friends of Mary Elizabeth Rowles.
Polly Rowles of Hollywood, uttered not a few "Oh, my dear’s"
when they saw her with Gene Autry in "Springtime in the
Rockies." My word, she was now acting in horse operas! What
they didn't know is that Gene Autry is now America’s Number 1
fresh-air hero. Though of the balcony ttade, more people saw
Polly Rowles in "Springtime in the Rockies” than in her two
other pinures for Universal combined, “Love Letters of a Star"
and Boris Karloff‘s ”Night Key.”

As for Polly herself, appearing with Gene Autry was de
termination to stay before the Kleig lights. Universal had failed
to take up her option, It had looked as though Polly and Mrs.
Rowles would have to return to Pittsburgh, the Cinderella career
at an end.

Polly was not trained for oats drama, nor did she really have
to wait by a dingy ﬁreside before Hollywood called. Her father
is a steel executive, her mother socially prominent in Pittsburgh.
Polly prepared for college in three of the East 5 most "too, too"
finishing schools. In 1931 she entered Carnegie Tech and went
beauty and charm’s route to the prominence that made her
“Campus Queen” her senior year. By 1935 she had played in
nearly every Carnegie Tech show to go on the boards. Then
followed further foorlight polishing in Pittsburgh’s Little
Theater.

The ﬁlm scouts that increasingly look over college perform-
ers finally saw Polly. She took a screen test. Universal gave
her a leading role in “Love Letters of a Star."

Now 23, of Swedish-Irish descent, it is likely Polly will stay in
Hollywood if she has to go through the College of Outdoor
Drama to get back into graduate work with the less wooden
leadingrmen.
