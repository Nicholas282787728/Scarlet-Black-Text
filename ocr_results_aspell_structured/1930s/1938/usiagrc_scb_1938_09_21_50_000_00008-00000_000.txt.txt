Track Cui
To Regular
Quarter Mile

Straightaway and
Curves Shortened
In Remaking Oval

The Grinnell track underwent
radical changes this summer when
it was Ctlt from a third-mile
track to one of the regulation
quarter mile.

Work was begun on June 27
and is not yet completed, there
being a possibility that the track
may not be in shape for use next
spring, However, work on the
project is going forward and ev~
ery effort will be made to finish
it in time for the 1939 track sea—
son, according to G. Lester Duke,
track coach,

Curves changed

In order to shave the oval
down to a quarter mile, it was
necessary to change the north and
south curves and move the east
straightaway in until it would be
just behind the temporary bleach—
ers.

The west straight-away was
left in are same position, but it
was resurfaced. The drainage sy-
stem on the track was also
changed and improved.

"We now have a modern, up to
date track that will enable spec—
tators to follow races on the back
stretch Without losing sight of the
runners." Coach Duke said.

Plans have been made for hav-
ing ore broad—jump pits, which
are now on the easq side of the
field, moved over to the west side,
leaving this space exclusively for
the pole vault.

High Jump Will Be Moved

The high jump, which is now
conducted in front of the west
stands, will eventually be moved
over to the northwest corner of
the field.

The track is now a six—lane af-
fair, regulation size, and will be
in much better condition due to
the re-surfsoing.

The extra space made available
on the east side is being filled inI
and graded, and will be used tor
a football practice field when it
settles.

The area. on the south will be
used for a practice rield this year,
thus leaving MacEachron Field
open for intramurais.

Homann, High, Hamann

Bob Hamann exhibited their kick—
ing ability in a football carnival
held at Drake university in Des
Moines Monday evening.

kicking, while Homann and Ms-

quick kicking ability to the crowd.

On Campus

The fall lecture course will be
inaugurated Oct. 13 when Frank
Lloyd Wright will make his ap—»
pearance on the campus. He is
widely known for his architectual
work in designing the hotel in
Tokyo, Japan, which has with—
stood several severe earthquakes.
Wright, who'was laughed at by
the world when he planned the
"ﬂoating foundation" for the Tok-
yo hotel, has been the architect
for several other world famous
structures, according to Frederick
L. Baumann, chairman of the
committee arranging the program.
In doing his work, Wright uses
the “functional architecture" idea
by which nothing is arranged
without a definite purpose.

He also specializes in modern
American styles of building.

of the year, as witness this year's
squad. They train several weeks
before the majority of students

This year we’d like to see the
squad maintain their high morale
and pep right down to the last
game, November 19. The only
way to do this is to give the play—
ers a break by enforcing some
rigid quiet hours in the men's
halls. To do this, the house coun—
cils and the men, themselves,
must cooperate 100 per cent to
.see that the iootball men are al—
lowed to sleep in quiet. Give the
1933 Pioneer gridmen a chance to
maintain their health and spirit
with lots of sleep, and we'll guar-
antee a successful season.

At the risk at our lives, we’re
going out on the limb this fall
