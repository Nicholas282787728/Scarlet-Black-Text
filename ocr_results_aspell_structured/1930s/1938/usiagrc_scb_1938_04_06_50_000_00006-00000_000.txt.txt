With the end of spring basket-

ball practice, the hardwood season ‘

was definitely over. An interest
ing aftermath is a fact that Coach
Truesdale discovered while comr
piling his annual statistics. This
year's team shattered the all-time
scoring record for Grinnell, which
is remarkable in that the team
lost nine of its scheduled 19
games.

Coach G. Lester Duke generally
has a crack lnlle relay team. Un-
til the state quadrangular meet
at Iowa City, Mar-ch 25, this
year's quartet had shown none too
well.

Luther, Hagan, Crannyr‘ and
Schlotterbcck ran their best race
of the year to finish a close seer
ond behind the Iowa university
team that won in 3.25. ,

The Pioneer runners were a
good five yards ahead of the
Drake team that had beaten them
twice before during the indoor
season. It will be interesting to
watch their progress outdoors.

If Coach Duke's hopes are real-
ized. Grinnell's track will he re-
duced from a third to a regula~
tion quarter mile size next year.

The track mentor favors the
shorter distance because it is the
length for a track that is unive
sally accepted and it will faci
tate training the runners in judg-
ing their pace more accurately.

All of the meets, with one or
two exceptions, are held on for-
eign tracks of the quarter mile
length, so it would be easier for
the thinrclad runners to train un~

First for refreshing mildness
-first for pleasing taste and
aroma that smokers like

—only cigarette about which,
smokers say “They Satisfy?

The mild ripe tobaccos—home-
grown and aromatic Turkish
—and the pure cigarette paper
used in Chesterﬁelds are the
best ingredients a cigarette can
have. They Satisfy.
