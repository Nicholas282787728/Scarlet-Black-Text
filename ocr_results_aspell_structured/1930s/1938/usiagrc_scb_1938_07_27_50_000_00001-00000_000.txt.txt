The “College Shop." popular
student hangout for the past five
years, will not resume business

lager. has announced. Expiration

Freshmen Boasts
Indicate Stellar
Football Team

According to the letters re
ceived at the office of the dean
of men, Grinnell should have a
football team equal to that of
any school in the nation in acou-
ple of years. Al. least that is the
general idea one gets if he reads
these letters, assistants in the of-
fice explain.

"I'm the greatest football play-
er my high school ever produced,”
or words to that effect are used
by practically every male student
who plans to enroll at Grinnell
this fall.

 

Each New Man Claims He Was
School’s Greatest Grid Star

If these words be true, perhaps
the college officials should sched-
ule Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Min~
liesota. and other great football
teams. for with a team composed
of "all-stars," Gl'innell should go
places in the football world

However, a check—up reveals
that two-thirds of the men ads
mitfed so far for next year stood
in the upper third of their high
school class. Keeping up with
the freshmen of two years ago,
the incoming class will boast that
(incrlllll‘d of its men are over six
feet tall.

Four of them are six feet, four
inches tall. while the shortest is
only five feet, four inches in
height.
