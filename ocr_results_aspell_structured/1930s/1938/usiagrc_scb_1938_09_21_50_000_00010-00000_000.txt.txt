Maybe you don’t like
first run movies or never
get a kick out of the hero

villain.

Maybe you like last
month’s magazines and
would rather read the re—
sult of a prize ﬁght in the
papers than listen to it on
the radio.

If you’re like that, then
we’re talking to the wrong
man, but it just seems to
us that you’d get as much
kick out ‘ of these Fall

trying them on.
