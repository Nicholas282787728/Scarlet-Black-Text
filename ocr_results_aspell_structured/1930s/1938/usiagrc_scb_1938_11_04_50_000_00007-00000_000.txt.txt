GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

PAGE SEVEN

.Questionol Conler‘ence Alter W39 ls Raised

5 Possible
Proposi’rions

Will Pioneers Join
Willi Iowa Group,
Midwest or Go Alone?

By Edward L. Wilson.

With the end of the football sea-
son approaching, the question of
what conference Grinnell is going
to join is becoming more and more
pertinent.

One hears rumors on every
hand, such rumors ranging from
the fact that Grinnoll will stay in
the Missouri valley to the idea
that Crinnell, Notre Dame, Mare
quette and Michigan state will
form the Big Four.

Five Yossibilit-ies Present. l
While neither denying rioi- con-
firming rumors, we would like to
set forth a few possibilities that
are ventured on good authority.
There are five possibilities in the
present set—up and probably some
that have been overlooked. First
among these is the possibility of
joining no conference and free-
lancing for games. This would be
possible to do during the football

season, but basketball and other

iLangau hall; and Joe Woodward,
president of the town men.

 

 

sports need a definite schedule
which could not he made up on a
free lance basis

Start New conference.

The second possibility for Grin-
ncll is to approach certain teams
with the idezt oi starting a new
conference with Grulnell. It goes
without saying the Grinnell would
not resort to breaking up any
conference for its own good.

Grinnell C

A third chance is that Gi-innell
apply for admission to the Iowa
conference. If such a move were
possible, Grinnell would not be in
favor of the rule now existing
which permits freshmen to con’P
pete in varsity athletics in that
conference, The only Grinnell op-
ponent this season from the Iowa
conference was Central whom the
Pioneers trounced 454).

The fourth alternative would be
to apply for admission to the Mid-
west conference. We now have
many rivals in that conference,
and weie we to join, such an ar-
rangement would he natural. How-
ever, Grinnoll can make no move
until relationship with tho Mis-
souri Valley is finished. The Mid-
west oonfei-cnce must be consulted
on the proposition, too.

COME

The fiftli possibility would be to
remain in the Missouri valley
which was definitely decided
against when we submitted our
withdrawal Dec. 4, 1937. The pur—
pose of withdrawal was to com-
pete with schools who are more
nearly oui- equal in enrollment and
resources. To return to the fold
would defeat the purpose of our
present position.
