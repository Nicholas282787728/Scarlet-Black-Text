LET' S SWAP

The signing of the Anglo-American Cana—
dial-l trade agreements last Thursday marks
additional and significant steps ill the di-
rection of freer world commerce. The All-
glo-American pact is easily far more im»
portant than the previous eighteen agree-
ments with other nations.

These latest agreements will be in force
to 1942 at least. Their success during the
next three years would undoubtedly be a
signal for still further advances alollg the
road toward necessary international econo-
mic readjustment.

The reciprocal trade pacts have been
sanctioned in advance by Congress They
have the support not only of Secretary
Hull, President Roosevelt and the other
Democrats, but also of former Secretary of
State Stimson, former viceepresidential
candidate Frank Knox, and a number of
independents such as David Lawrence,
Walter Lippnlan, and scores of economists
and men of business and finance.

The agreements: (1) Relieve the stagna—
tion of commerce. (2) Increase the econo-
mic well-being of the farmer, (3) Loosen
some regidities in finance and industry. (4)
Recognize the essential economic and politic
cal interdependence of nations, (5) Increase
the standard of living of all citizens direct-
ly or indirectly.

ORCHIDS FROM NORTHWESTERN

The following article is taken from a recent
issue of the Daily Northwestern:

"A little magazine with a bright red covV
er came in with the morning mail the other
day, Its name, The Tanager, gave no clue
as to its source or purpose, but the red

cover was interesting, So I leafed through
it looking for a masthead, and discovered
that it is, according to its titlevpagc, a bi-
monthly review published by the English
and Journalism departments of Grimlell Col,
lege . . . .

“I found four short stories, two sketches.
three poems, a fiveesonnct sequence, and
four book reviews. The first story, ‘My
Father: A Portrait,’ by Alexander Godin,
is a sensitive bit of realism. I thought it a
pretty fair effort for such small fry as
Grinnell, and my interest piqued, read
through the rest of the thirty-two page
magazine. 1 had to admit it. I had to bite
my lip and admit that The Tanager is a
live, interesting publication with literary
standards worthy of anybody’s college, I
noted that its contributors include the pi‘csiv
dent of Grinnéll College and one of its Eng-
lish instructors, both of whom contribute
book reviews . .

“Last year and the year before, Work-
shop, a twelve-page literary supplement to
the Daily Northwestern, had its days .
This year, in consequence of departmental
budgeteslashing, the Workshop grant was
withdrawn . . .

“Meallwhlle, Grinnell college, with eight
hundred students, manages an enterprise
more ambitious than any Northwestern unl-
versity has attempted ill a good many years.
But Northwcsternishowplace of the mid-
dle west—continues to nurse its 14,000
students along in their long slow affliction
of intellectual torpor. Somebody ought to set
the alarm clock; it‘s morning.”

The remarks of the “Nol'tltwcstcm‘s” col-
umnist are interesting and flattering; but
they would be positively pernicious if they
lulled Gl‘innell students into smugness over
their literary achievement. it is still la-
mentably true that most of The Tanager is
usually written by outsiders. Too often the
talented student, far‘ from regarding publi-
cation in The Tanager as a privilege, gets
an attack of something that ill the theatre
would be called stagefright or that might
be called coyness anywhere and refuses to
submit his manuscripts to the staff.

Anyone who knows anything about the
Englisll composition classes knows that a
large number of Grillllell students can write.
But he might well begin to wonder "hether
the students, if the Tanager had not been
long ago provided for them and kept runv

'lling by obligatory fees, would have enough

interest to keep the magazine ill existence.
If on some melancholy day Tile Tanager
goes the way of the “Daily Nortllwcstel'n’s"
Workshop. the same indifference, which is
stronger at Northwestern in proportion as
14,000 is to 800, will be responsible for its
death. A hard-working staff cannot do quite

all the work alone. ,

A COLUMN 0F PURE
BEAUTY

The Thanksgiving spirit hcillgup-
on us, it is only fitting and prop-
er that we devote our column
this week to counting the bless-
ings on the campus.

,,s:

We are thankful that it is not a
year ago today. There was a de—
cided lull on the campus as
Grace Blalkie was confined to the
hospital.

Jane Carson offers her Tllcuksr
givmg prayer on the fact that
they don’t make grades lower
than N. C.'s,

We are thankful for the crack of
the week which comes from Fro-
fessor Gannaway. "It's a great
life, if you don't woken."

z x e
The Zephyr is thankful that its
subscrlbers don't expect much.
The Carney boys give thanks that
the college is tolerant, (Such subt-
lety.)

Day by any in every wily this
place gels screwrcr and sclewiei‘
Last year there was no Hal Har-
din on the campus and we had
Hal Hardin's orchestra. This
year it's wlCe wersa,

mm which sucolnct remark, we
will sign off for the week. Have
a good time over recess, but don't
let the home town flashes take
your minds off the little hoys and
girls you left behind. So long,
Zephyr. We'll be BLACK wcck

_ OPEN FORUM

To the editor of the Scarlet and
Black:
Sibley, Ia, Nov. 167A reprint of
your article, “Some Political Ad-
vice to College Students,” appears
in the Des Monies Reglster under
(late of Nov. 16, less, In it I
find this sentence, “The Town-
sendites are a minority; but any
efficient minority cell victimizc a
democracy, as dld the prohibition
ists, as does any big business.”
I heartily agree with the “as
does hlg busmess.” As an ex-
ample of 'that I would like to
cite the domination of Iowa by
the legalized liquor fcrces. They

 

 

hold their authority by only 24,6
per cent of the cliglhle voters of
Iowa. (In the June 1933 repeal
electloll, the l‘cpeallsts had a ma-
jarlty of the votes cast. But un-
fortunately, that majority consu-
tllted c mummy of the voters,
Seventy—five and four»leliths per
cent of the voters either were
against repeal 01‘ were indiffel»
cnt regarding it.)

I hell] no liner for the Town-
sendites, but I don't like slighting
references to prohibition. To my
mind it was not only “a noble ex»
periment,” but the most efficient
method we have yet employed in
dealing with the liquor problem,

To the editor of the Scarlet
and Black:

Please acccpt my congratula—
tions [or the editorial which gam-
ed such a prominent place on the
editorial page of the best paper
in the Middle West As far back
as I can remember, I do not recall
having seen the Register copy
anything from c student publica-
tion. So you should feel highly
flattered,

Best wishes for your further

success.

MY AMERICA
By Lam's Adamic
This book is unusual! It is a
hodgepodge of impressions of peo-
ple and situations in an adopted
land. Not America the Beauti-
ful, but America the Real. Adam—
ic, in his preface, writes, “I do
not attempt here to put America
into a nutshell.” This is one
thing that the reader might like
about “My America." Here is an
immigrant reportin

Adamic takes his reader into
the debris that piled up in 1910
with the explosion of the lLos
Angelcs “Times" and he shows

affair. He makes a person vivid-
ly aware of the struggle of an
impoverished young Writer for
acceptance. With him, one goes
through the bread lines and the
anguish of the depression,

In one part, “My America" is a
discussion of the labor problem.
In another part, it is biography.
Elsewhere, it is a plea. for just
treatment of the new Pilgrims
who land at Ellis Island, the new
Plymouth Rock,

The possible participation of
America in war IS condemned 'ln
vicious terms. “My America" is
an aggregate of the incongruous
in our country. Adamic gives
his promise, “I believe that the
drama of things is the truth of
thlngs.” From this he concludes.
