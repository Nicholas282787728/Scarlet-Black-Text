attitude and democratic processes when
wisely organized that most readily accome
modate themselves to the changing world‘.’
W e llci'c in America have partially acquired
it few democratic attitudes and processes.
We still have a long way to go, Even so,
Germany is a long way behind us, and in
fact never had democratic attitudes in any
pronounced way. But democracy, being
what it is, that is the attitude and methods
which most readily satisfy the demands of
the historical process for incessant change,
make us say ”We Bet on Democracy,"

But it seems that democracy should have
a fultller justification than its ability to
accommodate itself to change. Thomas
Mann, the renowned German writer, now in
exile, in his recent book, “The Coming Vic-
tory of Democracy,” persuasively writes
that democratic forms, methods and atti—
tudes are the only ones in tulle with, and
allow for the expression of, the inner spirit
and essential nature of the individual man.
And that being the case, they are the only
ones which man, in the long run, will tol-
erate. Other forms, methods, and attitudes
will be brushed aside.

WE BET 0N DEMOCRACY

Mr. Gerhart Segar could not categorically
answer his question, “Will Europe be Ger-
manized?” And we too can not answer it
any better. \Ve don’t know the answers to
tomorrow‘s power politics, and its diplo-
matic wire-pulling behind the scenes. But
we do know that one, anyone, who bases
his judgments only on the scene in front
of him will probably make colossal blunders
in judgment.

History teaches us of the rise and fall
of all sorts and conditions of men, of gov-
ernments, of institutions, of ideas. We
have had dictators before, and we have had
democracies of ’various kinds before. Hitler
may be important, but it is not permanent.
Most democracies did not come into exist-
ence in full bloom. They had their trials and
tribulations, their successes and failures.
Isn‘t it too much to expect a German demo-
cracy to come illto existence ill full bloom
just because a democratic Weimer consti-
tution was executed?

By and large are there any lessons that
history teaches us? Probably none, except
the fact that change is incessant. That’be-
ing the case, isn’t it a safe bet that only
those institutions, political and otherwise
whch are based on a conception of change,
are likely to have any considerable durabil—
ty? And, essentially, isn’t it the dcmaciatic

way of noticing the superior scholarship 01"
ther students save by a letter grade. The
haphazard and occasional “honor courses"
in some colleges are very different from the
well organized system of “firsts” used at
Oxford, by which academic excellence is
rewarded. In America a private Greek let-
ter organization, which, to be sure, is found
ill about one hundred thirty institutions,
takes upon itself the task of recognizing
scholarship. That society is Phi Beta Kappa.

Charged with a responsibility shirked by
administrations since the beginning of the
growth of the American college 125 years
ago, Phi Beta Kappa does its duty system-
atically. Since election is virtually based on
high marks alone, the society occasionally
makes bad choices Occasionally, it fails to
elect worthy students But election is con—
sidered an honor, and rightly so, for by no
other way is conscientious application to
studies ill the college course noticed, even
although presumably one of the reasons
high school graduates come to college is to
learn.

Probably because Phi Beta Kappa does
not want to risk making too many errors
in judgment, it does not elect students until
late in their college career. But the local
chapter very properly feels that there is no
reason why the achievement of promising
lower classmcn should not be recognized in
some way. Accordingly this year the Grin-
nell chapter has named the four sopomores,
two men and two women, who on the basis
of their freshman records, lead the class
in scholarship These names, together with
those of the two seniors just elected, were
announced ill chapel Monday. It is to be
hoped that these new awards will encourage
not only the lucky four but all the members
of the college to work hardergnot for high
marks but for the “love of wisdom” which
Phi Beta Kappa, in spite of all its imper-
fections, stands for.

We feel it our duty to pause in
our day's occupations and shake
the hand of Yank .Atkins for the
beautiful friendship which has de-
veloped between him and Betty

REBECCA
'By Daphne Du Maurier.

noeders have found in Daphne
Du Maurier's “Rebecca” another
best seller. The author of ”Jamaica
Inn" here displays the ability to
tell a. good story and people it
with a “twinkling reality." The
novel. is a story of mood. absorbe
ing and engaging, full of intense
melodrama. English in background
and manner, it has an air of my-
stery and electric suspense about
it that is breathtaking.

The story is told 13 the second
wife of Maxim dc Winter, on Eng—
lish aristocrat. He meets and mom
ries her in Monte. Carlo and
brings her home to his vast and
beautiful Cornish estate, Mander-
1y. In spite of the growing devo»
Lion of Maxim for his new love,
the memory of his first wife, Re-
becca, constantly springs between
them. Tile glamorous and lovec
1y first Mrs. de Winter lives again
for the young wife, who grows to
know her predecessor from the
tail sloping “R" with which ,she
signed her name to the marvelous
efficiency she exhibited in the or-
ganization of the annual masked
balls. The action brings forth a
series of fast-moving and sinister
events leading to the climax and
the cunning surprise which nick
mateiy results in the solution of
the fascinating mystery of Re-
becca,

The redder grows to know
Maxim de Winter, with his cold
silences and haunted expression,
to know the immature young
wife with her lanky hair and
school-girlish nervous politeness to
the servants. Especially sinister is
Mrs. Danvcrs, the housekeeper.
who plagues the second wife with
llel' constant remembrances of the
adored Rebecca. Her gaunt figure
dressed in deep black. her ”skull:
face” with its prominent cheek
bones and deep-set eyes startling
in Its parchment—whiteness, she
moves mysteriously throughout
the pages of the book.

A highlight in the plot is the

 

scene in which Mrs. Danvers finds
the new wife in the west wing or
the great mansionithe rooms of
Rebecca. The melodramatic climax
is reached when Maxim's young
wife appears at the annual bull
in the deceased Rebecca's gown.

The novel is written with a
warm personal touch and meticul-
ously beautiful description, The
setting at the vast estate of Marl-
derly stands plainly in the read-
er's eye.

“Rebecca” is the
which one itches to r‘ '
tensity of the tone, the mysterious
mood, together with the dramatic
characterizations and unusual
twist of the plot, make it unfor—
gettable.
