Wrighl' Talks
On Thursday

Famous Architect
Will Begin New
Lecture Series

Frank Lloyd Wright, known as
the originator of the “American
expression in architecture," will
appear here Thursday as the first
speaker on the 1938-39 collge lec-
ture course.

Since 1897, when he went into
husiness for himself, Wright's dc-
signs for churchcs, schools, hotels
and industrial plants have been
widely acclaimed.

His most famous work is that
of the Imperial hotel. Tokyo. Ja-
pan, which successfully withstood
the earthquake of 1923, because.
instead of erecting it on a solid
foundation, he floated it on an
underground sea of mud.

His most recent move has been
the Taliesin fellowship, a cultural
experiment in the arts, situated
on his estate in Wisconsin.

Here Wright spends much of
his time with numerous young
architects studying under him.

Wright, according to the news
magazine, Time, has "unique orig
inality, a rugged honesty, and un-
ialtcring belief in his own ideas
of architecture.”

At the meeting the chorus
planned to give itself a thrill with
“Neapolitan Love Song" and the
“Gypsy Love Song," followed by
“Moonbedms” and “Romany Life,"
all from Herbert’s
Mill."
