undercurrent of rising enthusiasm
for the coming season, Over at

to find signs of the coming sport

oiie event is di wing quite a hit
of speculation in connection with
the cage season, and that is the
game at Stillwatei» Jan, 7, with
the Oklahoma Aggics. There is a
possibility that the Pioneers
might have the honor of playing
the dedication game for the beau-
tiful new field house at A&M on
that date. Henry lbs. the Aggie
coach, hopes to have the building
finished by then and give his ag-
gregation a chance to avenge the
only conference defeat of last sear
son that they suffered at the
hands of the Pioneers.

When the gridineii focc Central,
Friday night, they will be meet-
ing a team that has had qlute an
unsuccessful season to date. The
Dutchmen from Fella dropped
their first game to Drake, 45A
and then on the following week
end lost another, this time to St.
Ambrose to the tune of 36-0. Last
Saturday they staged a comeback
to whip Iowa Wesleyan, 19-7, so
they may be tougher than the
Pioneer‘s might expect. One thing
that can be counted on for sure
present a
scrappy outfit that will' give all
it has.

“Odebolt” or “Ody” over the pub-
lic address system Friday night,
it wil lbe for purposes of identi-
fication. In the Cornell game, his
proper name was used throughout
and as a consequence, several
Grinnell students and townspeo-
ple asked the halfback the next
day why he didn’t get into the
game:
