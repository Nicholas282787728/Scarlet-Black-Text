Scandinavia recognizes the fact
that democracy can not remain
static, but must be continually
subject to change and progress,
slated Childs, eminent authority
and author on Scandinavian af-
fairs.

lf democracy is to survive,
there must be a realization that
satisfactions with present gains is
not enough.

“Democracy must be carried on
from day to day, from week to
week, and from year to year," he
said.

Childs cited the tremendous ad-
vance made in the Scandinavian
countries in the last four decades.

May Disband
Chorus; Need

Male Voices

Huffman Refuses
To Direct Unless
Interest is Shown

The possibility that the Pioneer
chorus may be disbanded unless
more men are found to participate
in the organization, was expressed
today by Joseph Woodward, prcse
idcnt of the group,

F. Walter Huffman, director 01'
tho chorus, has stated that he
will not continue to direct the
group unless morc enthusiasm is
shown on the male side ot the
campus, according to Woodward.

"We almost disbanded this
week," said Woodward, “but Mr.
Huffman has consented to allow
the chorus to continue through
next week in hopes that there
may be better attendance,”

The chorus meets once a week,
Wednesday at 8:30 p,m., and is
designed for those students who
have not the time nor the ability
to join either of the two glee
'clubs.

The college has contributed
the music for the chorus.

“Tentative arrangements to
visit Pres. and Mrs. Nolien, and
a combined meeting with the two
glee clubs have been made,"
Woodward stated, “but it looks
right now as if all arrangements
must be discontinued."

Zephyr Homecoming
Issue Published Nov. 1

Homecoming issue of the Zephyr,
campus humor magazine, will be
issued Nov. 1, according to Rob-
ert Nichols, business manager.

Production is in the final stages
and printing will start immediate-
ly, he said.

“They're of . 'l

The whispeled insinuation has
gathered into itself the proportion
of a bull moosc’s howl. A horro‘r-
stricken freshman grabs her red
ribbon, leaps over her unmade
bed, and tears across the campus.
A dignified senior misses her
mouth by two inches and smears
red lip-stick across her right
cheek and doesn't stop to wipe it
off. A practicing soprano leaves
her high G throbbing by itself and
rocks the music building in her
haste to be gone. Even the Gri —
hell male is startled out of his
lethargy.

And Why? “They're off” has
nothing to do with the Brown Der-
by puddle-jumping trot or the
first kick-off in the Drake-Grinncll
football game. It is merely to do
with the clocks of Grinnell.

Maybe you are one of the lucky
devils who has outdone himself in
leaving the dorms at two minutes
before 1:30 p. m. and arriving at
the Alumni Recitation hall, coin-

Dale Bureau
Opening Sef

New Social Medium
Will Begin Next
Week—Woodwa d

The college dating bureau will be
officially started nextweek, Joseph
Woodward, head of the bureau,
said today.

He explained that those who
want dates for next week should
sign a ledger which will be kept
in the reception room of Mrs. Ha-
zel M. Bishop. hostess at the
White House.

The bureau will make arrange—
ments for the date. Meetings will
be arranged by the bureau, and
introductions will be made at the
White House.

“We have a special reward for
those who get dates for next Fri-
day night," Woodward said. “They
will be given a free ticket to the
Swing club over the .7. c. Penney
store."

He stated that the bureau was
organized not for monetary gain
of a small group of people, but to
act as a medium for those who

”are not included in the Grin'nell

social program.
The money obtained from the
applicants will he used to 'buy
games and cards to be placed in
the upstairs of the White House
for those who do not care to

 

dance.

College Clocks Foster Hair
Tearing and Teeth Gnashing

pletely winded, to hear the 1:25
bell ringing. Or perhaps you left
open house last Friday night at
11:15 (to avoid the rush) and
without stopping to look for four-
leaf clover-s, went straight to the
quad and got there at 11:47. Your
girl got campused, and you got
blaclt»balled.

Have you leaped from off your
hard, hard cot at the insistence of
the last breakfast bell, put on
your clothes on the way down-
stairs and had to wait five min-
utes for the dining room doors to
open?

Have you left your room with
the 15-minute bell ringing through
the morning air, only to burst in-
to Mr. Baumann's class and have
him smirk scornfully, “If you
can’t get here on time, you
Shouldn’t; be in college?”

If you have, you have likewise
suffered. liut don't take it too
hard. We're all in the same berth,
Be philosophical like Pope, for at
Grinnell the clocks are ruled and
read with the belief, "Whatever is,
is right."

 

 

Grinnell fo

Bulldog Team

Scarlet and Black
Clad Warriors to
Present Full Squad

By Clark A. Smith,

Tonight at 3:15 o’clock in Des
Moines will begin the 45th re-
newal of the football rivalry be—
tween Grinnell and Drake.

To the pioneers, this contest
will have more significance than
the fact they are battling their
most bitter foes. It will mean the
last game with the Bulldogs, as
a member of the Missouri Valley
conference, and the last chance
for Grinnell to meet its rival on
an “equal basis."

Different Story This Year.

Drake has not tasted defeat, in
the series since 1932, and last
year administered a 45—7 shellack-
ing to the Pioneers. Coach Guy
Lookaba-ugh feels that it's going
to be a different story this year,
at least in comparison with last
season's score

“We've got a‘hetter’team and
we have better spirit," the Plo-
ncer mentor has explained. ”The
boys are in good shape and are
ready to give a good account of
themselves. If Drake is over con-
fident and taking the game light-
ly, it is going to be surprised at
what we have to offer them."
Delensive Strategy.

All week Grinnell has been
learning a defensive strategy de-
signed to stop ihe powerful Bull-
dog attack. Likewise, the Pioneers
have been prepared to open up
with any type of offense that they
find will work. If it’s passing.
Fred Homann, Robert Harriann,
Edward Walters and Fred Luther
are ready to try their pitching
arms.

For speed around the ends, it
will be the shifty Luther, and
hal'dedriving Homann and Walters
ready to go. Kicking will be
strictly on the offensive side or
the game when Hamann drops in-
to punt formation. Yes, the Pio-
ncer attack is ready.

To the line will be given the
