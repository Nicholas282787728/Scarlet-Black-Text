WELCOME

An open letter to Mrs. Hazel M. Bishop,
Whlte house hostess, cull members of the
White house committee.

It is with a genuine feeling of satisfaction
that we view the official opening on this
campus of the long needed recreation center
known as the White house. To you, Mrs.
Bishop, has been given the task of guiding
the destinies of this new center.

The task of making the Wh '9 house all
that it should be will not be simple. We
have every confidence that under the guid-
ance of Mrs. Bishop and the committee, the
task will be accomplished and the White
house will become an important adjunct to
Grinnell college.

May we add in parenthesis our hope that
the functions served by the present White
house will become so important on this
campus that a complete student union will
become a reality through the pressure of
student opinion.

To you, Mrs. Bishop, and the committee,
has fallen a real privilege. To us in like
manner is given the privilege of a recrea-
tion center under your capable leadership.
Again, welcome.

The Editors.

YOUTH VS. PROPAGANDA
WAR MARCHES 0N

Reprinted from are Daily Northwestern

The American college student faces the
slaughter.

Two weeks ago a U. S. gunboat was sunk
in the Yangtze river. A few people were
killed, a few badly hul‘t.'And overnight the
popular feeling of the American public
changed from placid disapproval of Japan-
cse invasion in China, as expressed by edi-
torials, silk stocking boycotts, and bonfires
of Japanese products, to militant indigna-
tion reeking with nationalistic emotionalislll.
Diplomatic big sticks rattled. Proclamation
of a navy building program which will coll—
struct eleven big ships in the next ten years,
two to be built immediately, was loudly
heralded, and a valuable practical lesson was
given American youth in emotional reaction
to incidents which may be a preliminary to
conflict.

The college student is wise. Member of a
war-born generation, he readily accepts the
teachings of his embitered eldcrs. He knows
that the great war didn’t save the world
for democracy, that profits went to business
barons, that the depression is, his war heri-
tage. is is wise in everything except actual
cxpe encc ill crisis when other people are
losing their heads and the impact of national-

istic propaganda hits his cherished theories.

Two weeks ago the prevailing popular
desire was the isolationist policy to get out
of China. Today newsreels thrill audiences
with dramatic glimpses of flag-draped
coffins, and newspapers headline the con—
tents of “historic” notes.

N0 graver responsibility can face Ameri-
can youth in the coming year than this
necessary to View all “incidents" as calmly
as he has studied incidents of the great war,
He must protect himself impartially against
the subtle attraction of propaganda. He
will be the victim of the sacrificel The long
shadow of war threatens youth’s right for
a place in the sun.

BUSINESS STRIKES BACK

E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co. yester-
day brought suit for libel against Ferdinand
Lundberg, author of the controversial book,
“America’s 60 Families," and the Vaguard
Press, which published the book.

The suit, important in itself, indicates
how deeply the book’s accusations have cut
through the upper crust of our economic
setup.

Obviously such families as duPonts do
not usually take cognizance of such attacks
as these but ill this instance Lundberg’s
accusations have been the basis of attacks
by administration spokesmen on not only
the duPontS but others of the “60 Families,"
including the Rockefellers, Morgans, Fords,
and Mellonsl Now .Tzly Franklin has used
the book as a basis for a list of business
moguls in a position to control the economic
life of the country.

This suit then may be taken as the key-
note of business’ refusal to take these at-
tacks lying' down. It is possible that re»
moving the conditions underlying the at
tacks would be more effective than suits as
a means of striking back,

ELIMINATE THE SCOURGE

Drake university students recently made
news when they voted almost unanimously
favoring the Well known Wasscrman test
for Syphillis being given before marriage.

The vote was significant mainly ill that
it showed clearly the modern trend toward
a sensible attitude by young people toward
the Social diseases. Not too many years
ago such a vote would have been impossible
for two reasons.

First, that the mere mention of any
venereal disease would have been taboo,

Second, that few students would have
known anything about the Wnsserman test
and would not have dared admit to such
knowledge if they had it

Perhaps students at Grinnell would do
well to consider taking such steps as they
can in a group ill the nation-wide war
against the social diseases.

If every student in Grinnell would de-
mand the advantages of the Wassermzm test
in their physical examinations the resulting
knowledge would greatly aid the stamping
out of one of the greatest remaining
scourges of the human race.

WHO WANTS TO BE STRONG

Reprinted from the Dilily O’Colleginn

Noticable is the change ill conduct and
sentiment of students now that the end of
the semester and examinations are close.
There are fewer social functions this week-
end, Students who have played all semester
are getting down to work. Silence settles
over the campus and lights burn late while
students study. It’s a great life if you
don’t weaken, but who wants to be strong

"During the last 25 years, hazing has been dis-
appearing from colleges. This is due largely to
the fact that students are devoting their energies
to other activities and have little time for such
trivialities." Raymond M. Manchester, dean of
men at Kent State university, thinks students are
almost past the prankish “Rover-boy” days.

NEWS OF THE WORLD
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

So many events at nportanw
have transpired since the last ap—
pearance of this column that an
attempt at a. resume in the al-
lotcd space would be futile.
There have been some, however,
which should at least be men-
tioned because of the possible
repercussions from them in the
future,
t , 9:

Such a. one is the sinking of
the Pansy. So far as our govern-
ment is concerned, the incident
IS apparently closed and the calm
way in which the American pub»
he has accepted the incident
bodes well for our future ability
to stay but of war.

In the field of labor illl observ-
ers will watch with interest the
progress of the trial of Henry
Ford vs. the National Labor Rela-
tions board. The charge that
Ford violated the right of em-
ployees to collective bargaining
grows out of the attempts of la-
bor organizers to distribute lit-
erature in front of the Dcarbox‘n
plant last fall,

The possibility of any agrw
ment between the c. I. o. and
the .A. F. of L. were blasted by
the breakup of the conference
between John L. Lewis and
Green. At this writing it Seems
unlikely that peace between
these two factions in the labor
camp can be accomplished in the
near future.

The Roosevelt administration
took advantage of the holiday
season to launch several attacks
aimed at the moguls uf big busi—
ness who are accused of aiding
and abetting the current reces-
slon.

Tlllks by various nA‘lm
lion spokesmen, including
son, Secretary of the Interior,
lakes, and president Roosevelt
himself, furnished the keynotes of
the campaign

Yesterday the ﬁrst repercussion
to the attacks appeared indirect-
ly in the suit brought by E. I
zluPont dc Nemoul-s and Co.
against Ferdinand Lundberg, au-
thol‘ of “America's 60 Families,"
which has been the basis of much
of the criticism.

At the sumo time Jay Franklin
came out in answer to a. special
request with a partial list, drawn
from the same book, of business
leaders whom he classed as being
in a position to control the pace
of industry.

Antiphonal Choir Will Be
Organized Next Semester

An antiphonal choir, to be Cour
posed of 12 members, will be or-
ganizell some time in the first
half of the Second semester, ac-
cording to F. Walter Huffman,
instructor in singing. The choir,
which will sing from the balcony
of the chapel, will supplement the
Pioneer chorus, from which menr
bars will be chosen.

An interesting comment on the
frequently suggested boycott of
silk hosiery because of anti-Japa-
nesc feeling comes from New
York, Where officials of the i124
clusuy point out that from an 85c
pair of hose only 10c goes to Jul-
pan for raw Silk so that such a.
boycott would actually be antl-
American and effect the earning
power of some 500,000 wage earn-
ers in this country‘s hosiery in-
dustry.

.Prcsldem Roosevelt in his an-
nual speech to congress this week
announced his basic objectives
during the present session will
remain unchanged, They include
wage and hour legislation, farm
crop control measures, unemploy-
ment relief, no lowering of taxes
and legislation to curb monopolis<
tic tendencies in business.
