ARE YOU INTERESTED?

Several years ago there was a new idea ad-
vanced on the Grinnell campus. Such a thing
is not infrequent here, in fact we are so
used to hearing something new proposed,
something else that Grinnell can “pioneer"
in that we are inclined to pass it off with
a shrug of the shoulders This is fortunate
in one respect for certainly a new proposal
to a student body alwady jaded with activi~
ties must be good indeed to be successful.

This idea got its inspiration from Grill-
nell‘s grand old man, Professor Jesse Macy.
The original plan called for this idea to be
worked out in connection with and by a
‘ifunctional dormitory," this dormitory to
be called Macy house in honor of Mr, Macy.
The idea itself as expressed by President
Nollen in his 1937 report to the trustees
was “to use this house as a center of in-
terest in and discussion of matters of com»
munity organization and public service.”
Thus, the dormitory was to form a neuclus
for the study of current public affairs

Because of the location of the building
and other factors which entered ill, the idea
of the ”functional dormitory” failed, But
the idea back of the house, as it was tried
over a period of three years succeeding to a
greater or less degree, indicated to those
interested that‘this idea itself was not with»
out its merits. The question now is, “What
is a practical way of working out a plan
to get the students majoring in the social
sciences interested in an extra-curricular
way in the current problems of community
organization and public affairs?”

We feel that there is a definite aware
ness by Grinnell students of things going
on in the public affairs of the country to-
day, a definite enough feeling to warrant
the formulation of a plan whereby the
above object can be worked out to a great
deal of satisfaction to all those taking part.

One way in which similar ideas have
been taken care of on other campuses has
been ill the organization of 3 ”Politics”
Club Now we are not advocating or advis«

illg star ng another organization or group
just for the sake of another clllb. Such a
project would be a good one for the Inter-
national Relations organization to foster,
At present, the club’s activities seem to be
limited to the one big project ill the fall,
Couldn‘t it broaden its scope and promote
a program which would include a crosg sec—
tional View of public affairs ill this coun-
try? Such a program would have to be di-
rect and interestng, taking up only a few
major problems.

On the other hand if the International
Relations club does not feel that it is able
to handle such a program a group of stu—
dents might like to form an organization
without the benediction of the International
Relations club. Such a group should be coma
posed of all those interested and more pal»
ticularly of those students who are especial»
ly interested in public affairs Administra»
ton backing would not be hard to obtain for
a sincere effort toward such a club,

Along with the formation of such an
organization, the administration could cone
tribute toward its success by'offering a
course combining economics and political
science, especially as they pertain to pre-
sent day public affairs

These are simply suggestions toward the
carrying out of an excellent idea, We wel»
come suggestions, comments and criticismsI

THE TIDE HASTTRNGED—

Yesterday in his first interview since the
election, President Roosevelt indicated that
the results were not exactly unexpected, and
he added that New Deal objectives would
still be soughtt Perhaps he was kidding,
for he must know as well as anyone that
the ”breathing spell” is here ill spite of
him, and that the reform period is over.
Congress is not going to enact the new
legislation he desires. If he is wise he will
not get himself in the mess that Wilson and
Hoover got themselves into during their
last two years in office by attempting to
push Congress where Congress won‘t go.

We are in for a period of assimilation
and digestion After all, can any other
American president be credited with as
much reform and needed social legislation
as Franklin Roosevelt? No doubt he will go
down in our history as one of our greatest
presidents, but shouldn’t lie realize that the
country wants conciliation and internal
peace rather than economic and political
strife?

Does this mean that the nation has all the
reforms it needs—all the Social legislation
it needs? Have the problems been solved?
By no means! We still have a maldistribut‘r
ed income and wealth situation, 'a malad-
justed economic system, a poor tax system,
a national banking system that could be
made far more effective as a business and
price stabilizers, a railroad system top
heavy with debts, ag cultural controls still
imperfect, and we still have at least one—
third of the nation “ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-
housed."

Nevertheless, the people have had all the
reforms that they can take for a While.
They need on get their bearings before any
further changes are made. The greatest
wisdom at the moment would be to consoli-
date and perfect the innovations already on
the statute books, and to begin a period
of budget balancing and debt retirement

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“Let us see what we can do to keep the
light of tolerance, justice and free pursuit
of learning burning throughout this yearn"
Barnard college’s Dean Virginia C. Gilder-
sleeve sets a broad goal for today’s collegc
students

“Men and women tempered by four
years of exposure to disinterested scholar»
ships are less likely to fall victims to mass
hysteria, to coroding personal ambition and
to stupid fashions They are less apt to be-
come cranks or disciples of cranks." North-
western university’s Prof. William Jaffe
believes a liberal education makes students
“better prepared to become the type of citi~
Zens our strife»torn world so urgently

needs.”

\Vlly can’t the Zephyr be original
in its quips’.’ It was the policy
of the old Malteaser to pass ev-
el'ything off on Doric, If its feud»
in’ they want, we're more than
ready. Our smokin' rods are out
and achin’ to speak.
Zephyr‘s slogan may be “somer
thing in the wind"7we know
what that something is, just a
big blow.

Speak to the fairer sex when they

A survey of the situation shows
that he is speaking to two (2)
girls on the campus.

THE SUMMER SOLDIER
By Leone Zugsmith

While we Grinnellians tend to igr
bore the reality of Such remote
and no doubt pernicious institu-
tions as communism, socialism,
and fascism, Leone ZugSl-nith re~
minds us that life is still exist-
lng' outside of our Snug academic
security.

Zugsmith rather excites an
ambition to rescue the laborers of
the industrial south who are
bound to the monotonous life of
destitution by Northern capital»
ists. A college professor, a plzt
wright, a social worker, a mini
ter, an historian and a neurotic
adventuress, roused by the tor-
Lure and murder of rebellious lar
borers combine in an effort to
expose the outrages of the people
and to inspire reform measures.

The impractical expedition into
Chew county is the more danger,
ous because the group has no
prestige, poll cal backing, or
money. Each individual of the
group is risking his social and
economic position by associating
himself with so-called “Red" ac~
tlvltios, After some conflict each
agrees to participate

The group is prevented from
entering Chew county by those
representing the financial inter-
ests, and the people are quite pre—
pared for the arrival of the “for-
eign Reds" by the capitalist-cons
trolled newspaper. When the
group retires to a hotel in a
nearby town, they are seized by

 

the people representing the cap

Real Letterman
Retires from
Mail Carrying

George 0. Hutcnlns retired last
week.

This name probably does not
mean a lot to most of us, but
for more than a. decade he has
been a familiar figure to Gl-innell
students. He was mail man fol-
the college.

Hutchins will long be l'cmemr
bored by his oldrfashloned glasSeS,
that covered twinkling eyes, and
his bristly mustache. Although he
never associated with the college
students in any way, still he
seemed to be a part of the col-
lege life.

Hutchins considered it his duty
to secure a list of all the Stu—
dentS' names and addresses so
that during vacations he could
forward their mail.

Last week the day came when,
because of his age, HutchinS had
to retire. He did so still in the
best of health,

ltahst interests, beaten and forced
to return North.

The playwright is seriously
beaten; the Southern repreSentz»
Live is killed. Heartless, fearful
and self—concerned, the Social
worker. the adventuress and the
college professor return home,
ratinnsliring their cowardice, and
vowing to live safely. The play-
wright remains in the hospital
and the minister goes to Illinois.

Zugsmith’s vivicl character por-
trayal is not too pleasant, but
the realization that the condition
of the laborers remains un»
changed is even less reconcxlr
able. Tucked away in our own
little cases of complacency and
theoretical explanations, we ped-
antically say that the South's in-
dustrial development is 50 years
behind that of the North, and
50 years ago the condition of
Northern laborers was not too ele
evated.

No doubt they are ignorant,
dishonest and uncultured, After
all, we really cannot allow our—
selves to become too operwrought
by these conditions: we feel our»
selves to become too overwrought
the murder and torture of South-
ern laborers mean to us? What
do you know of the facts about
labor conditions in the South?

—Dorothy sunrall.
