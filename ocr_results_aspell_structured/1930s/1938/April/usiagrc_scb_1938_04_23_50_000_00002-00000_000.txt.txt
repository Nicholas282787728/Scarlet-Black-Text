WHAT ARE THE FACTS?

How seriously do college students take their work? Not
their class work, which in theory is rt matter 1'01- the in
dividual student to decide for himself, but the work which
they are hired to do by the college, which pays them money
to do it. Ideally, such work would seem to be an opportum
ity that makes possible a college education. An outsider
would probably assume that the serious studentgand he
would assume that only a serious student would want :1
college education enough to find it worth working- tori
would do the work assigned to him and do it conscientiously.
What are the facts?

A true answer to the question would involve a study of
the work habits of at least a representative group of stu—
dents. In the absence of such a study the following story
may be suggestive, if no more. The other day a member
of the department of physical education decided to set stun
dents to work on the tennis courts. From the employment
office he got the names of 25 men behind in their work, who
had said they wanted an odd job to make up time. Fifteen
were called and offeled w01k on the coults, work which, by
the way, could be done at odd hauls, not necessarily on a
fixed schedule Of the 15 called only one accepted and he
was willing to uoik fol only thlee houls. The excuses
ofl"eled sounded pelfectly leasonable and uele not quese
tioned, yet it seems a little odd that 14 peisons should all
have found reasons so plausible

Is there a moral? There may be several. Possibly stun
dents working spend too much time on outside activitiesi
have, in other words, too many opportunities to find excuses
to keep from working. Perhaps they do not take their work
seriously enough; in spite of the fact that the modern college
student is popularly presumed to look at life more gravely
than did his predecessols, no doubt he, too, plefeis to think
of youth as a time 01" gaiety. The conclusion that emelges
most clearly is that, though thele is wollt to be done about
the college and though there ule plenty of men to do it, the
work does not get done.

Distractions in
Dance Pageant
Seen by Critic

By rl Nienicycr

“The Firebird," as presented
Thursday and Finlay nights by
the womens physical education
dcpaitmcnt, was perhaps a tamer
ci-eatuie than that of the original
legend or of Stl‘avlnsky's music,
some of which was used phonoe
graphically to accompany the
dancers, but its plumage, thanks
its the costuming of Mr. Barry
Fsrnol, had lost none of the pum-
itive Russian gorgeousness. The
dancing itself was pleasant to
watch, the solos of Miss Grolie,
Miss Kozelka, and Miss strocbele
being of particular interest.

There were occasional dise
tractions from the unity of the
performance. The tumblers, for
example, did not too strongly
suggest Tartar Russia; hut pie
sumanly the Women’s physical
education department was willing
to sacrifice unity and commenda-
hie effort to demonstrate the wide
variety of actlvities which the
department encourages.

other distractions, such as the
individualistic behavior of each
of the two halves of the curtain,
the sometimes awkward pause
during record changes, and the
appearance of a. mysterious figure,
unidentified by the program, dur-
ing the dance of the snow maid-
ens, were not serious enough to
spoil the total effect of the porn
