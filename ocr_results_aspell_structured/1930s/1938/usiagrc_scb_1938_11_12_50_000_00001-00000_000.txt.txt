WHITE HOUSE COMM TTEE: REVlSE YOUR STAND!

We are laying the cards on the
table, and the cards are face up
for the White House committee

. to figure out. We are asking the
committee two question

1. Why has the town men's
organization suddenly been for-

bidden to hold open houses on
Friday nights at the White‘
House?

2. Why was permission to
hold open houses given the
town men's organization in the
first place?

Upon investigation, we have
found only three answers as
given by the White House com»
mittee:

GRINNEII SCARLET A

Z 209
VOLUME XLVI,

1. The women at the quad
rangle have complained that
they have no place to go and
smoke on Friday nights.

2. There are too many open
houses on the campus already.

3. Women who do not want
to dance or date are shut out
from White House activities,

In our opinion, the above an-
swers are far from reason
enough for denying the right of
open houses at the White
House. It could not be a ques-
tion of destruction to White
House property, for we have
found that town freshmen have
’made it their primary interest

to t' (e care of the ﬂoors and
furnishings of the recreation
center on Friday nights,

Why is it of so much inter-
est to us? Because [or once on
this campus one could go to
the White House on Friday
nights and dance without hav-
ing to have a date. For onoo
a stag dance could he heldincon-
junction with the regular date
affai .

The town men's open house
has been open to all, men and
women singly and in couples.
Men and women who did not
have dates are not excluded
from the White House on Fri-
day nights. Men and women

who do not like to dance are
not curtailed from using the
White House for other social
activities on Friday nights. ‘All
three floors of the house are
for anyone’s use at any time.
There cannot be too many open
houses on the campus. The
more open houses, the more
flexible the Friday night danc-
ing series will be.

This newspaper openly Sup—
ports the town men's organiza-
tion in trying to do something
to get away from the tradi-
tional “all-date" affairs on this
campus. Already over 200
names have been secured by
the organization in a petition

GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1938

it will present to the Student
Council Tuesday night.

We make it plain here that
we, as an organ of campus
opinion. working for the good
of Gl‘lnnell, fully object to the
action of the White House com»
mittee. and we ask that, in fair<
ness to all students, it revise
its stand.

If the men and women of
Grinnell are to enjoy a wider
range of acquaintances, if Grin-
nell's social life is to break
loose from its shell of just the
certain ones who engage in so-
cial activities, then non-restrict»
ive open houses at the White
House must be encouraged.

Pryor Refutes Story That Gary Cooper Did Not Make
National Collegiate Players; No Chapter Was on Campus

 

The old story that Gary Cooper
did not make Pi Epsilon Delta,
National Collegiate Players. while
a student at Crinnell, was refuted
this week by Mrs. Sara Sherman
Pryor, director of drama.

There was no chapter of Pi
Epsilon Delta at Grinnell when
Cooper was here.

At that time, there was a Grin-
nell dramatic club. This was
merely a social clique. and en-
trance was not always governed
by dramatic ability, said Mrs.
Pryor. It was this club that turn—
ed cooper down.

,Cooper Bid to Players.

In 1929 Grinnell was admitted

to Pi Epsilon Delta. When cooper
returned that year, he was asked
if he would care to pledge, He
accepted ,and application for his
membership was sent to National
headquarters.

Naturally his application was
accepted in recognition of his ace
hievements since leaving Crinnell.

Since acceptance there has been
a shingle and a key waiting here
for Cooper
Key in Safe.

It is kept in the safe at the
Registrar’s office.

If Cooper ever returns to Grin-

 

nell he will be initiated into the
Grinnell chapter of Pi Epsilon
Delta and at that time will be
presented with his key and shin-
gle.

GARY COOPER.

Until Mrs. Pryor came to Grin—
nell in 1928, this old dramatic
club was the only organization
on the campus that was open to
drama students. It had practical-
ly ceased to be interested in drar

 

ma andwas a well organized so-
cial group that ignored all the
other campus organizations.

Upon her arrival here. Mrs.
Pryor brought an end to this
clique. Her next act was to ob-
tain the admittance of Grinnell
as a chapter in Pi Epsilon Delta.
Dramatic Club ‘Goes.
with the appearance of Pi Ep-
silon Delta the Crinnell Dramatic
club was gone forever, but the
mistakes it had made remained on
record. Thus the newspaper writ-
crs who scanned the records
about Cooper‘s life here at Crin-
cll ,read of his rejection and
thought it was Pi Epsilon Delta
that had refused.

Hope to Initiate Cooper.

“We hope that this fallacy is
cleared up once and forever and
that in the future it will not be
written that Gary Cooper was for
fused entrance into National Col-
legiate Players.” said Mrs. Pryor.

Chapters of the fraternity in
California or the Grlunell alumni
members in New York could ini-
tiate Cooper, but the key is still
here, and hopes are still high that
some day he will return to re-
ceive these honors.
