Truce Called
After Students’
Wdr Fizzles Out

Amused because two college
men were alleged to have
caught a so-called small town
"heckler" and paddled him,
town men were reported last
night as havmg mobilized sev-
eral carloads of “armed" fight-
ers in Merrill Park.

Spectators failed to see more
than 10 to 15 town men, how
ever, when about 150 college
men showed up at the Botany
gardens and at Ward field,
after word had been received
in the men's dormitories at
about 9 p. m. that the town
men were “mobilizing,"

The fight, which amounted
to little, resulted in no in-
juries, according to a report

received late last night.
