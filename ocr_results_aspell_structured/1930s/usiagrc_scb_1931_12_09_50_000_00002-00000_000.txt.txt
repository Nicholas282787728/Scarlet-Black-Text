DISCUSSION WORTH WHTLE

Some Grinucll collegians have recently moul—
festcd all interest in disarmament to the extent
that an effort was made to secure a convocation
hero on the subject. Barnard college students pc-
titioncd a Congressional committee on the subject.
The Campus, Student paper for the College of the
City of New Yorl, is clamoring for a department
of peace.

These are only a part of the almost continuous
trend of pllblic opinion in that direction. People
no longer think of the glamour and excitement of
marching soldiers but of tho dczlth and hardship
involved in war

One wonders why American Legion represent-
atives, men who presumably knew the bloody ho
rors bollind‘fiue sounding phrases, should be lui
tarists. Jonathan Cole, in on article ill Vanity Fair,
suggests that. in the case of Frank Miles it’s the
”ten grand a year.” ‘

Disarmament propaganda is wcll organized.
Publicity on that side of the question seems to ex-
ceeld anything said by the militarists, Meanwhile
the paramount fact that veterans uphold military
strength scclns to belie many arguments. These
men are" not. the type who uphold such it cause for
”ten grand it your.”

The Scarlet and Black will not place itself, as
many college papers have done, with one side or the
other. Naturally, disarmament seems best to colr
legions and to many thinking men throughout the
world. Military strength has hccll 100 per cent un-
successful in insuring pence. Campus discussion
of the subject would inc t discussion.

AN AMERICAN PASSES

With the passing of Vacllcl Lindsay when he
had lnlrcly passed the halfrccntul‘y mark, Alllcrr
ico loses one of her lnillstl-els.

One of Lindsay’s greatest contributions was
teaching the American people the beauty of the
rhythm of poetl , For he not only wrote poetry
but from the lecture platform he taught apprcclar
tion of it. His audiences were first colupelltd by
his buffoollcry to take part in the chant at the end
of each stanza of verse as he read it, but then from
sheer lnftgllctisln of its charm entered the game.

Tramping through America as he did, exchange
ing his poetry for food and shelter, ho spread his
works by word of mouth as well as by Word of pen.

A religious mall, the gospel which he preached
was beauty. He fulfilled the conception that “to
write of truth the w fer must lead a good life.”
To his reader hc gi cs the feeling of America, be-
ing a devoted American nboulldillg in energy and
faith. He touches the bravado of the American
spirit in his poetry.

To American literature he added original sull-
jcct mutter shouing t-hzlt Amer o is full of themes
which had been overlooked from 1890 until 1912
when he published ”General Booth Enters Heavr

FACT OR. RUMOR

The Scarlet and Block. despite opposition, is
today publishing a story on the liquor iuvestiga
lion now in progress lime. This is carried because
the investigation itself is news, and action taken
either by Student governing organizations or by
the administrative committee is of vital interest
to the student. body.

Whispered rumors its to meetings and summons
may as well be made public it they are true. Grill-
llell docs not countenance drinking by students
here and letting both that students and the public
know that such is the case can do no harm.

Students alter paid to attend univcrs s of
Russia, but only those in sympathy with the ov-
erlllncnt are granted the privilege. Such a policy
here might result in the changing of some radical

views.

BUT SENIORS THINK
(From the Daily Northwestern)

Freshmen know more than seniors. At. least, that
is what a recent Carnegie foundation report declares,
going on to say that a senior loses much of the “know-
ledge" he'has acquired even before he receives his di-
ploma. The peak of his “knowledge” in many subjects is
reached during his freshman year, according to the re»
port. We wonder what the report means by “Knowledge."
If it uses the word in the sense of a group of isolated
facts, figures. and dates the assumption might be cor-
rect. But one can hardly call this storing—up process
“knowledge."

The senior has learned the relative unimportance
of facts. He does not. try to remember every note men-
tioned in his text book as does the freshman only a
few months out of high school. Rather,» the senior has
acquired from college the ability to think and reason
for himself. He not only knows where he can go to get
his facts if he needs them, but he has learned the value
of reasoning out their causes and effects. He knows
how to pick the chaff from the wheat.

The freshman does not yet know how to do this.
He still believes everything that is told him, accepting
without question the opinions of others, and especially
of his professors. He still has upon him the impress
of the grade—school memory process of education.

The claims of the report may be true, but if a
senior and a freshman were given an equal opportunity
to solve a difficult problem in their field. we would
place our money on the senior.

DOES COLLEGE SPIRIT —PURE HOKUM‘J
(From the Carletonlan)

This College spirit and loyalty stuff is pure and
simple hokum.” Thus spoke Dean Charles Maxwell Mc—
Conn of Lehigh university to the faculty and Students of
Brown university, assembled in an academic convocation,
as reported by The Campus, student newspaper of
Allegheny college, Meadville, Pennsylvania.

The dean is further reported as having scored the
theory that extrarcurricular activities are more im-
portant for the training of character than studies and
that athletes are more loyal 11.0 their colleges than
scholars, Athletes, he is reported as saying, went out
for teams primari because of a desire for publicity
and personal ambition.

Few people will disagree with the declaration that
extrarcurricular activities are more‘important than
studies for the training of character. It is doubtful;
and to many people totally indiscernableihow a person
can acquire character in a class—room. Class-room ace
quisition of character is probably possible, but it is a
vicarious acquiring through aloof and indirect contact.
It is in extra-curricular activities that one finds him—
self confronted either With character or the lack of it.

But is college spirit and loyalty stuff pure and
simple hokum? The Carletonian does not like to think
so. If familiarity and willing observance of college ”3.,
ditionsiand there are such things~do not breed loyalty,
what will? Why not loyalty und love for the college
ideals, as well as for the country? It's an argument
that can go on and on and on and on . . . ,
