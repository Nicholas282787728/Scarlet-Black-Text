I GRIDIRON GOSSIP

By MAX Ross

The Drake game was a heart-
breaking finish of an otherwise suc-
cessful season for Hank Thomas,
Captain Christoffersen, and the re
mainder of the seniors playing their
last game for Grinnell college Saturn
day when victory remained just out
of their grasp. 1f the gun had sound-
ed three seconds sooner in the first
half, the game would have ended in
a scoreless tie.

a r s

The performance of Thom a
throughout the season was almost
miraculous. He has the unique dis—
tinction of being the ,midisputed star
of every game in which he took part.
Always 1| marked mini, he still gain-
cd ground mid outsiiiurted tlic oppo-
sition to pull off scoring plays time
after time.

s n n

Despite the fact that every rival
team was out to smother him, Thomas
managed to escape serious miury
and probably played more minutes
than any other man on the squad.
His courageous exhibition in the
Drake game, playing with his back
in a critical condition, deserves the
tribute accorded him by sports writ-
ers and followers of the game

1 a .

He has the, unique distinction 01
playing a port in each of the 15
touchdomis scored by the Yiollecrs
this season. The ISOVpound phantom
completed 12 passes for touchdowns
during the year, one of them a later-

nl, mid scored three times himself.
I o o

In paying Thomas tribute, the rest
of Lhe team cannot be overlooked.
The Pioneers were far from what
would he called a one-man team. The
play of captain Christoffersen, the
great work of Duncan and McKee at

 

the ends. Bilto’s feat of playing
through the season at tackle with a
game knec. the splendid blocking and
defensive work of Graflund. Rosen-
bloom's sturdiness and Figlhnd's
fighting spirit, and the excellent sup-
port of the backs, .lamcs, Mooreary,
and Rose, should be given a share of
the praise.
s v- ,

Lust, but iar from least, is Lester
nuke, liuc com-h, who moulded an
inexperienced line into the finest for-
ward wall in sci-oral yours. \ ith
only liwo letter-men, he worked pn-
ticntly with sophomores and last
years i- errcs filling gaps with the
now men. Allllmlgll the line aver-
aged a little more than 170 pounds,
it outplayed opponents 20 or 25
pounds heavier,
