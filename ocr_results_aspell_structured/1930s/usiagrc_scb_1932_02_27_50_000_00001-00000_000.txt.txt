Representatives of the freshman
and senior classes will inaugurate
the new 11 a. m. chapel period Mon—
day, when Charles Whitmorc will
speak on ”What Chapel Means to a.
Freshman,” and Roberto Vance will
discuss, “What Chapel Mcans to a
Senior.”

Because of the fact that the stu-
dent body.was instrumental in vot-
ing for the change in the scheduling
of the morning chapel period, it was
thought appropriate to have the first
of the new 11 o‘clock chapels under
loomplete control of the students. Lce
Alexander will preside.

This chapel system will be in force
untrl spring vacation, during which
more it will be on trial. According to

 

faculty members, if students co-oper-l

As a result of the change, mornrng

those with four morning classes, and'

that there wrll be an increased chapel
attendance.

Several years ago 10 o‘clock chap-
els were scheduled but were changed
to 3 a. in. because it was believed
that students abuscd their privileges
during the chapel pcriod.

Recently agitation was started to
