Forster Claims United States Defeats
by Indiscriminate Embargoes

Peace Aims

Englishman Gives Secondl
in Series of Talks
on World Affairs i

By “‘ALTER from Y i
That the United States is defeat»;
lug its wish to prevent war by dc-
claring on indiscriininatiug enlllal—
go on war materials, was thel
theme used Thursday night by \v.l
Arnold-Forster British labor-itc. l
In speaking on the subject, “Isos
lation and Neutrality," the second
of his series of eight lectures on}
inter-national relations he said,
that there is an oversimple anger l
in America about revelations of
profiting in war supplies.
Dealers in Death

“There is the feeling- that it is,
intolerable that men should make‘
profits through war," he declared.‘
"Such men are looked upon as
dealers in death, as dealers with,
the causes of war.”

In discussing the recent peace
conference in South America be-
tween the United States andi
other countries of the western
hemisphere, he stated that the
United states proposed a consulta-
tion between the American na-
tions in time of crisis. The pri-
mary purpose of the conference
was to formulate plans in which to
prevent war and to preserve peace
in the western hemisphere,

No Penalty

“Yet," he continued, "the rules
adopted there to preserve peace
will have no consequences, because
there is no penalty provided should
the rules be violated,

He pointed out that there were
two main elements in that peace
program. In discussing disarma-
ment, the first element, he de-
clared that the problem of onus is
not a problem of one hemisphere
but a problem for the whole world.
The proposal of collective secur-
ity, the second element, was re»
jected by the South American re-
publics, and he added that, in his
belief, those countries were right
and had a good reason for doing
so.

henounoe Position

"Most of these nations,” he said,
"were members of the League and
such members renounce a non-
moral position in world affairs.
He stated that one pledge of the
League is non-neutrality.”

In discuss'ng the United States
Asiatic posi on, he outlined three
policies this country may choose:

1. Armed cooperation to defend
an agreed rule of peace, such as
the Nine Power treaty, the wash-
ington treaty, or the Open Door
in China.

2. Disarmed isolation, with-

drawing from all problems con-
cerning Asia. The withdrawal of
the United States Asiatic fleet l'nc
to the East Pacific with her navy
acting as a defense for our west
coast,

Isolntod Menace

3, isolated menace. in which the
United states would make clear
that she would not be concerned
over any trouble arising in Asia,
but that she would give a warning
to Japan that the open door of 197
gal trade in China must he prer
served, and also that the United
States will prevent Japan from
seizing control of the Philippines,

The speaker, in commenting
on which of those three poli s
the United states should choose,
stated that the third policy could
not be a success, because it would
expose the United States to a
maximum risk. He declared that

the most effective policy would be
one of the first two mentioned.
Turns to Europe

In turning to Europe, he de-
clared that the idea of the Amer-
ican people regarding European
difficulties is just “let them stew
in their own juice."

He' pointed out that there are
no less than 10 hills before Con-
gress on what stand this nation
should take in event of a matior
European war,

“The United states," the speak
or said, “in event of a European
war, could impose an arms embar-
go to both sides alike, regardless
whether one side or the other, or
both, is keeping faith with this
government in the Kellogg pact

Not Merely Neutral

“The United states is not mere-
ly neutral," he said, “but is also
hostile to the League's peace
building efforts."

In asking the question as to
whether this policy goes far
enough in event of a major Eumc
pean‘war, he declared that the ere
portation by the United States of
copper and oil is likely to get us
into as much trouble as the expor-
tation of finished guns and ammu»
nition.

1914 Policy

"Are we going to hack a 1914
policy with great armaments and
force our threat,” the speaker
asked, "or are we going to forfeit
our threat and hand over our
rights to any belligerent nation?
If the United States were to try
to obtain a maximum business,
a clash would result, A code of
rigth cannot be worked out in ad-
Vance."

He went on to say that in the
Napoleonic war, the United states
went to war with Britain because
of neutral rights, that in the Civil.
war we became involved with
England claiming belligerent
rights, and that in the World war,
this country was again claiming
neutral rights.

Neutrality Legislation

In commenting upon the propos»
als up before Congress dealing
with neutrality legislation, he stat-
ed that an embargo policy should
be a comprehensive one, and add-
ed that all of the proposals in
Congress are based on the fact
that the American trader is as~
sured of making all the profits,
while foreigners should take all
the risks.

Indiscriminating Embargo

In reviewing the difficulties ofl
an illdjscn’minating embargo, the
speaker said that there are four
problems faced by the United
States

“First, there

is the economic

pmblcm, which may arise in
peace time,” he pointed out. “The
policy of making America salts
sufficient by cutting off trade
would stimulate economic natioir
alihm. It would injure America's
export trade in peace as well as in
war time." He illustratcd that
by pointing out that over 40 per
cent of America‘s copper goes
abroad. ,

Second Difficulty

“The second difficulty." he do
ciared, “is the economic problem
in war time. He asserted that inc
dustry in the United States is be
coming more potent and that this
policy will make it even more ex-
plosive in event of war."

In discussing the moral charac-
ter, the speaker stated that be»
fore our entrance into the last
war, President Wilson pleaded to
the American people not to take
sides in the conflict. '

“Toddy,” he said, “there hasn't
been a day when the American
press hasn't been passing judg—
ment on world problems."

The speaker quoted the secre-
tary of state, in commenting upon
the final difficulty, the political
end of the problem, saying that
Secretary End, at the Pan-Ameri-
can peace conference lest fall.
claimed that it is impossible for
people to tolerate war, and that
the people must destroy war or
war will destroy them,

stricter law schools are necessary
to help alleviate the "appalling
Conditions” which exist in New
York city's legal profession, stat-
ed Dean Young B. Smith of the
Columbia law school.

Drawing a dismal picture of an
overcrowded and poorly-paid pro-
fession in his annual report to
Pres. Nicholas Murray Butler,
Dean Smith said:

“Conditions in the professions
throughout the country as a
whole are bad enough, but in New
York city they are appalling."

strengthening his stand that

from a recent survey made by
the CommiLLee on Professional
