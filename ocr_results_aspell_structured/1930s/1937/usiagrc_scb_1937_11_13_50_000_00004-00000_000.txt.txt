to make our team as nearly repv
resentative of campus opinion as
possible. To do that we are
asking everyone on this campus
interested in sports to submit
their selections for an Ali-Ameri-
can team to us, The Grinnellen-
try will be composed of a com-
bination of your selections.

This is not a contest, although
if necessary we will offer a
prize of one nickel cigar to the
selection which comes the closest
to the combined team. We are
simply doing it because we think
your choices combined will be a
better Aiermerican team than
we alone could pick.
