FACTS ABOUT YOUR PAPER

The SCARLET AND BLACK has been the subject of
considerable discllssion during the past weeks, and a few
words of explanation might not be amiss. The dilemma
faced by the paper is this: On one hand the students are
asking for a better paper—more sixepag‘e issues-more fea-
tures, more pictures. On tlle other hand the management
is anxious to be associated with such a paper but finds its
self face to face with a great increase in publication costs.
Thus, the following publication schedule will cost $100 more
than last yenl' 5 total publication cost.

2 —10-page issues (one of uhich has aheady been

published)

IZiGrpage issues (three of. which

published)

Road—page issllcs (four of‘ which have already been

published including today's issue.)

Last year, you received the following:

1—14/pag-e issue
Sis-page issues
287671333 issues
23—4-page issues

Obviously, if you are to receive the kind of paper you
want, and the kind of newspaper befitting Grinnell College,
definite action must be taken at an early date. There are
two possible sources of revenueiadvel'tisillg and circulation.
Present indications ,would lead one to believe that local ad-
vertising may be slightly better than last year but that the
decrease in national advertising will more than offset what-
ever gains may be .made from the above source. Conse—
quently, we must look to circulation.

At the present time the SCARLET AND BLACK l'e-
ceives 75c per student per year which is sufficient to cover
little more than 40 per cent of the publication costs before
provision is made for salaries for the managing editor and
the business manager. This this sum is below the average
granted to other college newspapers is revealed by a survey
of 142 college newspapers conducted by the Associated
Collegiate Press. Of this number 125 received money from
the college on a “fee" basis, the remaining 17 having volun-
tary subscriptions. The rates granted them are listed in the
following chart:

50c per student per year.
75¢ per student per year.
$1.00 per student per year,
$125 per student per year
$150 per student per yeal
Over $1 50 pm student per yeal 4 papers
Not reporting . 3.7 papers

This difference is even more notlcea 1e w en viewed
with the following in mind:

Newspapers with over 60 issues yeally 19
Newspapers uith 37- 60 issues yearl . 10
Newspapels with less than 37 inssues yeally. .113

The SCARLET AND BLACK has 57 01 mole issues
Annually.

The SCARLET AND BLACK is your paper and is
only as good as you want it to be and make it. Obviously,
if the SCARLET AND BLACK is to be a real college paper
it will need additional funds. It is not for us to say where
they must come from. nor even to decide if they must come;
the decision rests with you. However, we do hope that this
editorial will help to explain our position and clarify the
question.

NEWS OF THE \‘VORLD
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

The Japanese succeeded in cap-
turing the important railway
junction at Shihchiachuang this
week. There is now no important
resistance to the conquest of tar.
ritory extending to the Yellow
river, 250 miles south of Peiping.

This area is the home of nearly
80,000,000 Japanese and contains
rich deposits of coal, iron and
aluminium. The land is fertile for
growing cotton and good for the
grazing of sheep.

Three automobiles flying the
flag of the British consulate were
fired on by Japanese planes near
Shanghai. Additional international
difficulties arise from the fact
that several Russian officialswere
passengers in the cars.

of an agreement made with Hit-

In the United States, president
Roosevelt announced in a radio
“fireside chat” Tuesday night his
intention of asking the special
session of congress, called earlier
in the day, to enact crop control
and wages and hour legislation.

The enactment of these two
types of legislation will bring the
administration back into the posi-
tion it occupied during the first
years of the “new deal.”

Legislation for the rcorganizn.
tion and consolidation of admini-
strative activities will probably be
tackled at this session, and it is
likely that some definite action
will be taken on a nine power.con.
fercnce to discuss the Chino-Japa»
ncse situation.

The A. F. of L, led by presi-
dent william Green, meeting in
Denver, 0010., issued a statement
this week asking the c. I. o. to
repudiate John L, Lewis and come
back to the fold. Next day, Lewis
turned the tables with a state-
ment to the effect that the c. I.
0. form of labor organization had
proved successful and that for the
c. l. 0. to go back would be to
turn traitor to labor.

Over in Europe, France is he.

idea of joining with England to
open the Spanish border and allow

J. Theodore Marriner, United
