for Position

iyear, “Wild William" immediately
made his Isa-pound presence felt
in the middle of the Pioneer line,
and after the second game played
steadily and sometimes brilliantly
at the pivot post for the remains
der or the year. When Thanks

unanimous choice in second tcanp

Out With Knee Injuryi

In the fall or '35 Fowler suffer-
ed a serious injury to his knee.
He aggravated the injury the fol-
lowing week and as a result was
out of action until the last two
games. In spite of his injury
Fowler's play was so outstanding
that he was chosen to captain the
less squad. Last rall Bill con-
tinued his steady play and was
again an allrconference selection.

All of the above eulogy is
merely to give you an idea of the
task that confronts Lookahaugli
as he seeks to fill the center
(position vacated by Fowler.

"The picture isn't as dark as
it might be," Lookahaugh readily
admits. “I know I‘ve got a good
center in Ed Vaughn because I've
seen him perform. I'm hoping
that the other two boys trying
for the position will prove to bc

 

 

as good, or even better, than Ed.”
other candidates.

The other two boys in question
are Howard Grimes, the Manila
ail-stutter and More Shelton, hailr
lug from Lincoln, Des Moines.
Judging rrorri the battle those
three candidates are waging this
spring in the grid drills it would
appear to be a mighty tough
proposition to deﬁnitely say one
is hotter than the otheri crimes
is the biggest of the three, Shei-
ton is the best passer and Vaughn
is the most agile. All three play
defense well and back the line in
a manner strongly reminiscent or
“Wild William" Fowler.

By any standards the center
position seems to be taken care
of. Having strong contenders
three deep at a single position is
a new experience at Grihnell.
Perhaps 1937 may sec the foun-
dation of a powerful center lra»
dition at Grinnell which may in
time be comparable to that of
Michigan One thing is certain
Lookabaugh smiles when you
mention center. They’re making
it easy for him to forget Fowler.
