Basketball. ‘
Fan's "Awai’r .
Big Season

With Prospects Brightest
in Years, Pioneers 0p-
en Dec. 6 at Minnesota

By Wells H. Barnett

As the first crisp, chili winds
of November begin whistling
shrilly through the gaps and me
terstices in the walls or the men's
gymnasium, thence proceeding to
the south end of Ward field where
shivering gridders contemplate
the remaining three contests on
the schedule, dyed-i {he-WOOL
basketball tans begin to stir and.
mutter in their cocoons, mutteringl
fretfuliy about fouls and free
throws and field goals and fast
breaks.

Big Ten Titiehoidei-s

For, come Dec. 6, the Pioneers
will embark on another cage sea-l
son. On that date a Grinnell
team with the best prospects of
any in the memory of the oldest
inhabitant will engage the Uni»‘
veraity of Minnesota, last year’s
Big Ten titleholders in the open-
ing battle of the season.

Things are rosy in the Pioneer
cage camp this year. Returning
from last year’s team which
finished in whirlwind fashion after
a shaky start, defeating both
Creighton and Drake, will be Co-
Captains Jimmy LaMasney at for-
ward and Hal Dean at guard.

Berry, Conwiil

In addition, the opening practice
sessions will find Bob Berry, re-
gular gmrd, Spider Conwill, re-
gular forward, and Wilbur Luick,
regular center, back at their old
posts ready to start. The only
loss sustained by the Grinch
squad was Bill Fowler, reserve
center.

Reserve strength in plenty will
be available. Fred Luther, Vern
Robinson, Jim Wallace, Jim Nash,
Vernon Cornish, Harold High, Ted
Appelquist, all will be available
for active service.

No Easy Echedule

The Pioneers will have no easy
schedule to face this year. They're
starting out good and strong with
that Minnesota team, slack off a
bit with Coe, and then whip right
into lows state at Ames before
going into a tough conference
schedule. And then they get on
the conference route, the fun
really starts. because they will
have their hands full with Okla-,
home, last year's champion
Drake, always strong; Creighton,
whom we licked last year for the
first time in the hostory of the
school; Tulsa. another of those
rapidly improving southern teams.

And don’t discount Washington.
which in the past has usually
managed to stop Grinneli at least
once in the season; and Washhurn
and st. Louis university. And
just to keep their hands in, the
Pioneers will take one weekend
of: and entertain Carleton, with
one of the strongest small-college
teams in the middlewest.

house chairman’s room where

The more common jobs in thel
kitchens range from waiters and
kitchen janitors.
Included in this wide range are
jobs on the dish crews, silver
crews, assisting in the pantry,
cleaning the pots and pans, and
helping the cooks prepare food
for the hungry horde.

Some of the Jobs that attord
practical experience in certain
fields are the job of switch board
operator in the quadrangle. An-
other that wouid fall in that group
would be the secretarial posi-
