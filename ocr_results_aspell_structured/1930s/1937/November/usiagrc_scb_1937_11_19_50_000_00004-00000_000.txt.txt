ALUMNI WELCOME!

A Message from the Prcsidcut of the
Alumni Association.

We’re mighty glad to see so many of you
”Old Grads” back to help celebrate Home-
coming.

Time has played its usual tricks with some
of us: a patch of grayness, a few wrinkles,
an expanse of baldness with a few clinging
oases here and there; that‘s about all. By
and large you haven’t changed very much;
neither has the college. It’s the same old
campus, the same old spirit of friendliness,
the‘ same old “Never say die” spirit. In
short it’s the “Grinnell Spirit" that still
predominates.

Edward L. Nelson ’11,
President Griimell Alumni Association.

THE TEST OF LIFE

This week-end we will welcome back to
the campus our old grads, men and women
who have gone out into the world and tried
to apply their college experiences to the ex-
igencies of business and life outside these

cloistered walls.
“Is college worth while?” is an oft

reiterated query. There seems to be réason~
able doubt in the minds of many. The fault

or the weakness in college life, if there is'

any, however, probably lies in the students
themselves.

College is not aimed to prepare‘ one to
step from the top of the scholastic ladder
as a senior onto one of the upper rungs of
the business ladder. We are eternally fresh-
men in life. The progress through the four
classes of college life is but one of a series
to which we are all condemned. Our years
in college will be most valuable to us if we
remember how and why we make progress.
To the extent that we learn how to learn
will we be successful as freshmen in busi-
ness. One is forced to “deliver the goods"
as an employee, whereas as students ollr
defections are overlooked. Yet, those who
early make a habit of “delivering the goods”
will find themselves more successful when
there is no choice—in the world of business.

YOUR ALMA mi?

To you alumni of Grinnell returned this
weekend to witness the homecoming football
game with St. Louis, we extend a warm

welcome.
We are particularly glad to have you here

because you and we are tied together by our

common interest in Grinnell college, That
you may have a good time here is our sin-
core wish. Yet we do not want you to go
away having seen your Alma Mater through
rose colored glasses.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Since your graduation, changes have been
made here which you as Alumni should
know about and be interested in. Some, to
our mind, are steps toward the develop
ment of Grinnell into our ideal. Others we
think are steps in the opposite direction.

The Student Leaders conference held the
first of this year, and the resulting plans
for a recreation center, we class as pro-
gressive, as are recent additions to dormi~
tory and quadrangle accomodations.

On the other side of the ledger we place
the new grading and out systems and lack
of adequate athletic and recreational facili-
ties which we consider drawbacks to the
school.

We could suggest other problems for your
consideration but we prefer to let you, as
you mingle with the undergraduates, find
out for yourselves about current conditions.

Again we extend to you a warm welcome,
Your interest and cooperation has and will
continue to be an important influence in
making Grinnell a college you are proud to
call your Alma Mater,

PUT THE TAX BURDEN
WHERE IT BELONGS

Secretary of the Treasury Henry Mot»
ganthau, speaking before the Academy of
Political Science recently, stated the domes-
tic tax situation clearly in one paragraph as
follows:

“The amount of our income tax revenue
is only about half our total internal revenue.
Less than 3,000,000 people of our total pop-
ulation pay individual federal income taxes.
We would be applying the principle of cap
acity to pay more justly if we were to re-
duce the number of consumer taxes and at
the same time to increase the number of in
come tax payers. Taxpayers rWllD are
squarely confronted with their own burdens
are bound to be keenly alive to the way the
money is being spent by their government.”

Astounding as the fact may be, it IS
true, that less than three per cent of our
population pays direct income taxes. Be-
cause of the so called “painless” consumer
taxes, the majority of citizens believe that
they are not paying the expenses of federal
government.

Actually the figures show that the mass
of the people are paying more than half the
operating expenses of the national govern-
ment.

. Not only is this true, but the very appli—
cation of indirect taxes puts a penalty on
spending, while at the same time the plea
is to get money into circulation and improve
business conditions.

The income tax, applying to those
whose incomes are well above subsistence
levels, if used in place of many of the pres-
ent indirect taxes, particularly on non-
luxul'y commodities, would do much to place
the tax burden where it should be, on the
shoulders of those who can afford to carry
it

AN OPEN Dooﬁoucv FOR GRINNELL

A recent visit to another school brought
home to us the realization that nearly half
the doors on the campus buildings are never
open. Strange as this may seem, a little
thought will remind you that most of the
college buildings have double doors, one of
which is invariably locked.

Whatever the reason for this strange
situation may be, it seems economically
wasteful to use only half the doors, to say

nothing of the factor of convenience,

We don't like to seem overly optimistic
about the possible benefits to be derived
from opening both doors but such a policy
applied to the chapel at 9:20 might con—
ceivably save someone from being trampled
in the rush. If that seems far fetched you
will admit it would be convenient to be able
to walk out of Alumni Recitation hall other
than in single file.

At any rate we think that if the open
door policy was good enough for China it
should be good enough for us.
