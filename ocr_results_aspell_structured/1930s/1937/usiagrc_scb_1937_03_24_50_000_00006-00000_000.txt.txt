Mnkes statement

Retiring managing editor Hunn
when asked for a statement for
publication said, “I think that the
curriculum Como
mittee rests entirely upon a. legal
technicality, and makes ‘no at-
tempt to consider the welfare of
the paper. in this case not only is
the judgment of the Publications
board being over-ridden, but also,
1 feel that Mr Coriett is not re-
ceiving a square deal, However,

.lt is all now a matter at history,

hilt I do feel that the Scarlet and
Black is less of a free pape and
that the Publications board has
conic to mean less "

Bennett L. Brink, retiring bush
ness manager and lumber of the
Publications board, said, “The ac-
tion of the curriculum committee
does not seem to he in the best in-
terests of the Scarlet and Black,
but once the decision was given, i
felt that we could only accept the
action of the committee and choose
the next best man for the job,"

No statements

other members of the Publica-
tions board declined to issue state-
ments for publication.

The complete text of the letter
declining to waive the technical
eligibility requirements, written to

“MID Max Hunn, Editor

"Scarlet and Black

“Gl'innell, Iowa

"Dear Max:

“After the committee from the
Student Publications board with-
drew from the curriculum commi -
tee yesterday (Monday) the Com—
mittee discussed your problem
fully anti sympathetically, but vot.
ed unanimously that it was the
opinion of the curriculum comm -
tee that the Student Publications
board should try to find another
editor, either a man or a woman.

"I am sorry that this difficulty
has arisen, but 1 am confident
that the board will be able to find
another applicant who will be both
qualified and able to work for the
Scarlet and Black.

“Sincerely. yours,
“(SignedJ Bethana McCandless,
