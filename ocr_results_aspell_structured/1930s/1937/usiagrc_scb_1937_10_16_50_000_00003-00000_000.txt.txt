Truesdale Sees
Good Year for
Baske’reers

20 Reporting for Drills;
Fowler Only Letterman
Lost to Squad

By Wells H. Barnett

With twenty men now report-
ing, basketball practice for the
1937-33 season started this week,
and Coach John Truesdale and
the Pioneers face now what looks
on paper like the best season in
many years.

Fowler Gone

With the single exception of
William Fowler, who played
guard, but was not a regular, all
of last year's team have returned.
The combination of Dean, Luick,
Conwill, LaMasney and Berry
which suddenly turned into a wme
her at the end of last
schedule is intact, with no losses
to the grid squad. With a year's
seasoning under their belts, that
combination should be hard to
beat.

In addition it will be bolstered
by a number of capable reserves,
many of them veterans of last
year’s campaign. John Hayward,
now reporting for football, will
probably be more of an alternate
than a reserve. Fred Luther, if
his shoulder lasts out the grid
season, is likely to fill the same
role, unless he beats out Conwill
or LaMasney for a starting post.

Reserves

In addition, Robinson, Lynn
Sampson, Cornish, High and Wal-
lace of last year's team will break
into the lineup frequently. And
all of them will be pushed hard
by several capable members of
last year’s freshman team,

Of course, it isn't quite all
peaches and cream Truesdale has
at least two major worries. One
of them is the overconfidence
bugaboo, which even now is get»
ting to look pretty serious in
'I'ruesdale’s opinion. Grinnell will
win the ball games, he says, if
they go on the floor prepared to
fight, not feeling that they're the
better team before the game
starts. Overconfidence can cause
a lot of heartbreak.

Luther A Worry

The other worry is Fred Luth-
er. Luther injured his shoulder
twice last year, once in football
and once in basketball, it is felt
that his return to football this
year means that he will not be
able to appear on the hard court
at all. However, if his shoulder
does survive the current grid
campaign, he Will strengthen PM)»
neer chances immeasurably.

Men reporting now include Co-
captains LaMasney and Dean;
Berry, Conwill, Cornish, Luick,
Sampson from last year's team.
Beisenstein, Covey, Infelt, Mon-ﬁe
son, R. Miller, D. Miller, Pederr
sen, Shipley and Vincent Wallace
from the freshman squad of last
year.

Football men who will report
later include Hayward, High,
Luther, Nash, Robinson and
James Wallace.

Strongest Squads

The DibbleeSmith game was
regarded as one of the most im.
portant of the season as the two
teams were considered to be the
strongest of the six dormitory
teams. There was not a minute
during the game when one team
seemed to be superior, and not
until the game ended was the
