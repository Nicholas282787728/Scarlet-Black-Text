Hekking Pleases Audience
rWith Cello Concert Last Night

Cellisl’s First Program
Rated ‘Among Great‘
by Reviewer

By F. WALTER HUFFMAN

Those of us who heard the vio~
loncello recital by Gerard Hekking
last evening are deeply indebted to
the Griririell Cap and Gowll society
and the Wumen‘s Social Budget
committee for bringing this artist
to our campus. The response of
the large audience indicated to its
full and unqualified approval of
the choice. The girls who had
charge of the program deserve and
have our heartiest congratulations,

When a comparatively new art-
tist greets us for the first time we
instinctively make comparisons
with those we have heard in the
past. In the field of ’cello we
think of Gasals, Salmond, wallen-
stein, Feuermann, Piatigorsky.
Where will we rate Mr. Hekking?
Your reviewer feels that Mr. Hek-
king has won for himself a perma-
nent place among the great. He
possesses unmistakably the tem-
perament, musicianship and virtu-
oso technique which is part of the
equipment of the firsts-ate artist.
He is, as one student expressed it,
"about the speediest mortal on
four strings and a wooden box
he’d ever Seen!"

Program Appeals

Whether it was fortuitous or de-
liberate, I cannot say, but the pro-
gram seemed of the sort to appeal
to our musical palate. We in Grin-
nell are accustomed to a diet in
which there is much Bach, Beetho-
ven and Mozart, and when we see
a familiar dish before us, such as
a Bach Suite, we smack our lips
in keen anticipation of being boun-
tifully fed. We were well fed last
night with Sammartini, Haydn and
Bach and with Mr. Hekking's own
compositions which had many
elements in common with these
gentlemen The Debussy was a
type of dessert which is always
welcome after a heavy meal.

Now to return to Mr. Hekking.
There can be no question that he
is exceedingly adept in the per
formance of the music of the 18th
century. He knows phrasing, his
rhythm is vital, and he has a way
of bringing an element of spon-
taneity to music in which form
and pattern frequently predomi-
nate.

variety and Restraint

I don't think I have ever heard
a Each suite played with more
variety and restraint and yet
achieve all of the values of male
ody and rhythm intrinsic in these
dances. can you recall the deli-
cate tone of the Gourante and the
lilting character of the Gigue?
These numbers were exquisitely
interpreted.

The Haydn Concerto, while giv-
ing opportunity for virtuoso dis-
play, surely deserves a place in
the solid works of the 'cello reper»
toirc, Haydn was eminently a
lyricist; this quality is evidenced

in all of his instrumental and
choral works. He had an exhaus-
tive knowledge or instrumenta-
tion; this is recognizable in all of
his 31 concerti. Mr. Hekhing took
advantage of the Adagio move
iiient to give us a strongly emo-
tional interpretation of its lyrical
passages and convinced us of his
right to a virtuoso by his master
ly performance of the difficult
cadenza of the Allegro movement.
Freshness ol Debimsy

Wc enjoyed the 20th century
freshness of the Debussy sonata,
This is one of his latest works and
ireveals the maturity of his style.
The Serenade was in the nature
of a Scherzo in which a Harlequin
is tryingr to begin a serenade and
is interrupted and compelled to
move on. The sonata is somewhat
programmatic in character.

Mr, Hekking‘s own compositions
reveal-a talent in this direction
and a thorough knowledge of what
is effective for the instrument. He
was forced to respond with an en
core and he gave the imaginative
Ravel Bolero. Mrs, Beatrice Kus—
chan provided excellent accom—
paninients.

to say that "some students look

their lsections of sheepskin, but
most look forward in signing res~
