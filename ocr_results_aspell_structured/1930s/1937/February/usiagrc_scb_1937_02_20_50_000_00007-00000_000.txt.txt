Pioneer Swim
Team Meets

Carls Today

(ﬁnnell Tankmen Seek
to Avenge, Defeat

Early in Season

Varsity tankmen sought to a.
venge an early season defeat this
after-noon when they met the Car—
leton college swimmers in a re-
turn engagement at Northfiel
Minn. Carleton defeated the Pi
neers two,vweeks ago by a score
of 39-36.

Ten men accompanied by Coach
Guy Lookabaugh and manager
Charles Bear left Friday night
for Mason City where they spent
the night, driving on to North
field this morning, The swim~
mers will leave on their return
journey to Grinnell Saturday
night.

Fair chance for Win

Chances for a Pioneer victory
seemed fairly bright based upon
a comparison of the records of
the two teams. Grinnell lost the
dual meet with Carleton here
when the Carla overcame a Grill-
nell lead in the 160-yard medley
relay to win the event and the
meet. Sharp, Carleton diver, nos-
ed out Liverlnore, Glinnell diver,
for second place in the diving by
a margin of two-tenths of a
point, and had the decision gone
to Livermore, Grinnell would have
won the race despite the Carleton
victory in the relay.

If Livermore can defeat Sharp
for second in the diving, and
should the other events turn out
as they did in the meet at Grille
nell, the Pioneers might turn up
with a victory. Another possi-
bility for a Grinnell victory is in
case that the Pioneer's are able
to win the opening free style re-
lay. Gn'nnell lost the free style
relay by a time margin of one
and two—tenths seconds and should
they lower their time, they might
defeat Carleton.

Garnisch, Carl star

Dick Carbisch, Carleton cap<
tain, is expected to star for the
home team being conceded first
in his favorite event the 220-yard
free style. In addition he will
swim on both relays, or in case
that the longer events are used
he may swim the 44D-yard free
style.

According to Coach Looka-
baugh, the men making the trip
and their events are as follows:
Earl Melgard, loo—yard back—
stroke, 160»yard relay, loo-yard
free style; Harry Livermore, 1607
yard relay, diving; Boyd )3an
ch ~ diving, Goryard free style;
Erik Voss, Goryard free style, 100-

Howard Whitney, 44Dryzrd free

Yale President Condemns
Professional Trend
in College Athletics

New Haven, Conn.7(ACP)7
College and university athletic
teams should compete only with
other institutions which follow a
set of standards similar to theirs,
suggested Pres, James Rowland
Angell of Yale university in his
annual report.

Condemning professionalism
college circles. he stated:

“The impression is abroad that
the recruiting of high school stu-
dents for college athletic teams
has reached a new peak and that
the practice of paying college ath-
letes for their services is now more
wide-spread than before.

“I am not in a position to pass
judgment onsthe correctness of
these impression he said, ”but
that the procedures mentioned are
extremely pernicious, I am obliged
to believe. Needless to say, they
are most obnoxious where they
are surreptitious and carried on in
defiance of regulations intended to
prevent them.

“The frank defense of subsidiz»
ing athletes now so frequently
heard, even by college representa-
tives, reflects either a council of
despair or a divergence of ideals
and standards so fundamental that
the general agreement is not to be
hoped for.

“It seems expedient for each in-

stitution to cultivate athlctic rela—
tions only with those whose views
and practices substantially coin-
cide with its own. This will lead
to contests as nearly equal as can
be arranged and should do much
to minimize bad feelings," he stat~
ed,

Dealing also with the depres-
sioll’s effects on the national edu-
cational system, Dr. Angell's re—
port pointed out that hard times
had taught the people that educa-
tion, instead oi belonging to the
“young or the privileged row, lies
at the very heart of a sound social
order."

Although he claimed that the
universities had gained lasting
benefits from the depression, the
Yale prcsidcnt exprcssed hope
that it would not again soon be
necessary to measure plans and
programs by the financial yard-
stick rather than by spiritual and
intellectual advancement,

‘Dirlless Earming’ Process
Named ‘Hydmponics’

Berkeley, Czlif.——(ACP)7“Dirt»
less farming,” a system of raising
flowers, vegetables and fruits in
tanks of warm, fertilized water,

has been formally christened “‘hy».

droponics" by its orginator, Prof.
w. F. Gericke of the University of
Californi

Explaining “dirtiess-farming,"
Prof. Cericke used the term “hy-

 

droponics." Originally the Califor-
nia scientist planned to name the
process “aquiculture,” making it
consistent with agriculture. hut
"aquiculture" had already been
used to designate the economic
utilization of natural waterbodies,

Upon the suggestion of a facul»
ty colleague, Prof. William A.
Setchell of the botany department,
Prof. Cericke adopted the new
name. “Hydro” in Greek means
water and "panics” is Greek for
lahor. A combination of the two
means “water-labor."
