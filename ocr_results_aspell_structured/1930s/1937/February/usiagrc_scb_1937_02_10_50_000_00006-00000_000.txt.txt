His second method is similar to
looking through opera glasses in
reverse, that i scientific investi»
gation. This is disappointing, Dr.
Ames said, because when we view
the vastness of the universe our
being becomes suffused with a
feeling of futility. Our petty ac-
complishments seem insignificant.

Motion Picture Film

“The most effective method,"
Dr. Ames sai "was to look at life
as a motion picture film. In this
way you see many impressions.
You get both causes and effects
and man is shown as a complex
agent." Dr. Ames went on to say
that this method offered an escape
from mall's feeling of insignifir
cance for it views life in the light
of man’s accomplishments and his
masteiy of the forces of nature.

In explaining man's inferior feel.
iiig. Dr. Ames pointed out that
teachers and preachers have cloud-
ed man‘s mind by instilling within
lum the belief that he is innately
wicked but that the doctrine of
evolution emphasized man's own
great development of his power to
learn and to make use of his abil-

“With the advent of modernpsyr
chology and its use of introspecV
tion, man is beginning to believe in
himself," Di. Ames asserted, "and
when he is not successful in one of
his adventures he iises from his
defeats and tries again to attaina
new goal."

Ames Says ‘Human Life
A Maze’ in Second Talk

Life IS a maze to men who
must make their way through it,
There are many ways and means,
and men otten waste energy by
following the 'wrong road and
having to retrace their way.

These were statements given by
Prof. Edward Scribner Ames, of
the University of Chicago in the
second of his series of Gates

lectures. on “Ways and Means,"
Tuesday night.
Seek “’ny Out.

Human beings have been trying
for thousands of years to find a
way through the maze. Means
have been developing for years to
control world. Bow and arrow,
Weaving, speech and the use of
steam were all advances ill Cun‘
trolling the world, according to
the speaker.

Professor Ames stated that the
environment a man lives in is an
important factor in his develop-
ment. The westward movement
was motivated liy expectations of
political freedom and better stand-
ards of living, It has been claim-
ed that wars are to aid the peo-
ple, but this is never true

“Ideals further human advance-

Professor Ames. some educators

much of a trend lately to make
education the end rather than
merely an instrument to use to

Herbert Marshall says;

‘...a light smoke is a joy
to the throat”

"Before I came over to this country
an English cigarette appealed to
me because it was ﬁrmly packed.
In America I tried various popu—
lar brands looking for the same
virtttet Lucky Strike led all the rest.
And what’s more—I soon discovered
that Luckics were a light smoke-
and a positive joy to the throat.”

HERBERT MARSHALL

FAMOUS RKO RADIO PICTURES‘ STAR

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and womenmlawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, 87% stated they personally
prefer a light smoke.

Mr. Marshall veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the radio,
stage, screen, and opera. Their voices are their
fortunes. That’s why so many of them smoke
Luckies. You, too, can have the throat protection
of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain harsh
irritants removed by the exclusive process “It’s
Toasted". Luckies are gentle on the throat!
