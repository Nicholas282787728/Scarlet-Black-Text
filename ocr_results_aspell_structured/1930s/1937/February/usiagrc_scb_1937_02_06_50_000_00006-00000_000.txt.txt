Society Demands
Curbed Impulses,
Psychiatrist Says

Society demands that people
ciirh their emotional impulses, der
clared Dr Samuel H, Kraines of
the Psychiatric institute of Chi
cage and the University of Illi~
nois school of medi ne, lecturing
on “Mental Hygiene‘ before the
women’s orientation class Thurs-
day morning.

If a mood can be thought of
as a straight line, Dr, Kraines
suggested, the various moods of
one person can be designated by
m1 up and down curve along the
line. in achieving emotional sta-
bility, the aim is to bring one's
moods as near to the base line as
possible.

Postpone Judgments

“When one is depressed," Dr.
Kraines said, "judgments should
be postponed, as the mind is idle
and thoughts revolve more and
more about oneself."

Standards of good personality
are attractiveness, stable emoe
tions, thoughtfulness, sociahility,
seriousness and friendliness, “Use
common sense," Dr. Kraines urg-
ed. “No rules are applicable at
all times." Talking to people
who are irritating will help build
a good personality.

Self Tolerance

One must have self-tolerance,
Dr. Kraines pointed out. Self-
tolerance is not the condoning of
failures, but the attitude that
everyone is human and makes
mistakes.

Nursery schools, personnel work

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

land clinical work are new phases
of the increasing field for psychr
clogists, Dr. Kraines told psyche
ology majors and other interested
students when he lectured in the
,uadi-angle drawing-room Thurs
Jay noon on psychiatry as a vo-
cation.

‘ Tension ureilh Problem

1 Tension is one of the greatest
problems the psychiatrist faces!
he said. It occurs because the
person is laboring under the word
"must." “If you wish to do
something, do it in a relaxed man,
her and not under a strain. A
person under tension accepts
false values for his goals or ub-
pects in life," continued the
speaker.

Nervousness, akin to tension, isl
the result at a lifelong habit of
refusing to face one's problems.
he said, In curing nervousness,
it is necessary almost to remake
the entire personality of the pa-
tient, “However,” he declared,
“the number who are actually‘
cured is surprising."

Vocations Class Speakers
Discuss Advancement
Possibilities in Business

Chances for advancement in
large and small business were dis-
cussed at the regular meeting of
the vocations class yesterday afts
ernoon by c. L. Hulsizer, president
of Hulsizer inc, of Des Moines, M.
L, Frederick of General Electric
00., and Norman DeWind of Par-
son's Manufacturing (30., Newton.

Mr, Hulsizer advocated that the
college graduate try to get ' to e --
ecutive work, or some position in
which he will come in contact with
all parts of the organization for

 

 

which he is working. He pointed

.out that the opportunity for self-

development and self»expression
was one of the advantages of
working for a small firm. The
chances for building a small busi-
ness into a large one are as good
as those for going to the top in a
large concern, Mr, Hulsizer he-
heves.

Mri Frederick described the
qualifications for the successful
employee in a large corporation
Alertness, willingness to work, and
the ahility to learn were among
the important requisites men-
tioned. Personality and initiative
were more necessary for business
success than scholarship.
claimed.

Mr. DeWind mentioned earnest
ness, intelligent interest, integrity
of purpose, and attention to d tall
as the‘most necessary qualifica-
tions for business success,

Dartmauth Organizes
Extracurricular Study
of Phases of War

Hanover, N. H.7(ACP)7War
has put in its appearance on the

extra-curricular study program of,

Dartmouth college.

Interest in warfare has been so
manifest that certain members of
the Dartmouth facultyinot the
college itself, have organized a
course that deals with the various

phases of conflict.

Prof. Bruce w. Knight, sponsor
of the new course, has announced
that the series of eighteen evening
meetings is open, without fee, to
anyone who wishes to enroll.
Many of the sixteen speakers who

he}

 

have agreed to lecture saw service
in the world war.

“No college, so far as I know,"
said Professor Knight, “offers a
general course on war. This ap-
parently strange gap in the curri-
culum may he due to sharp dc-
,partmental cleavages of the social
sciences. Of course the prohiem is
a broad one. A teacher in a given
department knows something of
war but mainly the part immediate
to his own field.

“This is a study of war, not a

ichance for confirmed pacifist: to

blow off steam. We have taken
the precautions to keep thrill-

hunters out of the course. Never-
theless, we have found enough
students willing to do the work
without college credit and enough
teachers ready to present it in ad-
dition to their regular work.

"The whole thing is roughly di-
vided into three parts: first, the
natureof war along its vai ous
fronts—political, propaganda, nail-
itary, economic and so on; second,
the costs of war4'economic, cul-
tural, eugenic; third, the means of
preserving peace as related to the
leading causes of war."
