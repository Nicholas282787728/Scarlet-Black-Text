WHAT‘S WRONG WITH
THE VOCATIONS CLASS?

What is the matter with the vocations
class? Lack of student interest? Little
student initiative? Too much divided re—
sponsibility” All of these things may be
legitimate criticisms, but do they get at the
core of the trouble?

When J. E. Nyhan, former president of the
Grilmell Alumni association of Chicago was
in Grinnell recently he said that the most
constructive thing any vocations class can
accomplish is the establishment of definite
contacts between prospective employers and
job—seeking students. To do this well it is
necessary that executives in business and
industry be made to realize that it is to
their advantage find business interest to
come to Grinnell, address the vocations
class, and meet the seniors inter sted in
their respective fields. And it is this prob-
lem of persuading the heads of business to
send representatives to our campus that
confronts the committee which conducts
Grinnell’s vocation classes.

It is an impossible task for students to
handle successfully without the guidance of
someone directly connected with the indus—
trial world, a person who is himself a part
of that world. Except for the cases of a
few of the more progressive companies like
the General Electric which yearly sends
representatives to colleges throughout the
country, the members of the class commit-
tees hnve found it impossible to contact the
specific heads of business who will be ill—
terested in employing college graduates this
June.

It is this lack of organized leadership
from within the ranks of industry itself

, that is one of the outstanding factors con—
tributing to the prevalent indifferent atti-
tude which most of the members of the
senior class have towards the work of the
vocations class. This problem must be
solved if the class is to continue.

ROOSEVELT AND THE COURT ,

President Roosevelt's proposal to reorgan-
ize the federal judiciary, which he sent to
Congress last Friday, has brought forth it
great deal of comment from the American
press

In the recent edition of the United States
News, David Lawrence discussed the prop}

sol. Mr. Lawrence believes that the presi—
dent’s reason for the proposed judicial
change—that the work of the court is coll—
gested—is not his real reason for his recent
announcement. How would the work of the
court suddenly become less congested il' six
new judges were to replace six old ones?
Alld how would the addition of six judges to
the present number of nine speed up the
business of the court? he asks.

President Roosevelt has asked the right
to decide the number of United States Sun
prcme coult judges, True, attempts have
been made to pack the court befol'eibut
not by a chief executive. During the Civil
War, the Republicans were at odds with the
court. Congressional lenders spoke of im-
peaching the justices, of abolishing the
court, and of requiring a unanimous decision
in order to invalidate the acts of congress.
It was suggested at that time that the court
be packed.

Lawrence declared, “If there is anything
wrong with the life tenure clause (of the
Constitution) by all means let us change it
through an amendment to the Federal coll—
stitution itself as we have done in the
states r r . . there can be no better way to
preserve our democratic processes than to
let the people decide whether they want the
system of choosing justices of their court
changed.

“For, be it observed, Mr. Roosevelt has
not proposed a simple change in the compo-
sition of the Supreme court. He has not
followed the established precedent whereby
Congress has assumed the right to specify
definitely the number of justices who shall
constitute the Supreme court of the United
States."

Since its creation, the number of justices
of the high judicial tribunal has been change
ed five times but each time by the sugges-
tion of Congress and not by the chief execu»
tive.

“What Mr. Roosevelt has done," Lawrence
declared, “is to set up a theoretical number
of judges for a theoretical set of circum»
stances and to apply his plan to an existing
situation in which his own administration
has fared badly at the hands of the Supreme
court."

The government of the United States was
founded on the principle of three distinct
federal governmental divisionsiexccutive,
judicial, and legislative. Such a system was
created so that each division would act as a
check on the power of the other divisions
and so the power of the federal government
would not become concentrated in one of the
three branches

If the American people disapprove of
President Roosevelt’s action they must reg-
ister that disapproval by bringing their in-
fluence to bear upon Congress. If they
approve, nothing more should be said. But
we must not assume that by the overwhelnr
ing vote the president received in Novemn
her, the people did approve of such a change,
for if we look back we remember that
Roosevelt avoided the question put to him
by his Republican opponent—whether or not
he intended to meddle with the Supreme
court

Other Opinions

“We are wasting time if we indulge in prolonged
discussions as to the place oi analytical geometry
in a freshman curriculum while jails and park
benches are being filled by those who need an
education which has some meaning in everyday
life " Temple university‘s Pres. Charles E. Beury
:llggests a waste-basket for the old curriculum.

“I wouldn't claim for educational radio the same
values that can be claimed for campus study. If
there Should ever develop an overlapping of values,
there would still be no conflict, for radio can reach
those who find it impossible to attend regular
campus classes, Dean Ned H. Dom-horn of the
division of general 'education at New York univer-
sity docs not fear the competition of “ether-edu»
cation.”

Have you yet heard of the young girl in a
Latin class who translated the story of Achilles
into English? Concerning that famous episode in
the life of the great warrior, her translation said:

“His mother, holding him by the heel, dipped
him into the River Stynx, until he was fairly in»
tolerable.”

 

DORIC

Having experienced the ravages
of the current epidemic, “the three
clay flu," we give herein the vari-
ous preventative and curative
measures. While this free advice is
not guaranted to conform to U. s
standards, it nevertheless brought

us through safely.
. r s

oral siu ng sensation coupled
with aching fect and back,
throbbing head and heart, sore
throat and eyes, upset stom—
huh and frayed nerves y a
may feel sure that Something
is Wrong With you. It is not
necessarily three day nu, but
it is mil to take the usual
lrmltment.
s
The ttoatment; 1. Secure a good
hook of between 50 and 60,000
pages. 2. Find a flat, comfortable
bed. (While this is nearly impos'
sible m the dorms or quad it is an
ideal worth strivmg for.) 3. Get
three kinds of pills, as follows; a.
large pink pills, b. small brown
pills, 0. large white pills. 4. Take
these pills whenever you happen to
think of it. (The less you think of
it the quicker you Will recover.)
5. Put in a standing order for
orange juice. Having done all
these things it is best to allow the
sleep of exhaustion to have its
way.
s a t.

The convalescenoe: 1. Sleep.
2r Road. 3. Sleep. (Under no
conditions should the patient
study.) Ann: having the di-
sease for three days it is wise
to rest for a period of not less
than three days and certainly
not more than two weeks.

Having thus provided for the
general welfare we can now turn
our attention to’the next national
holiday, a holiday of special sig-
nificance to Grimellidns, St. Val»
antine’s day comes at a particular
ly untimely date this year, as in»
dead it has in previous years on

the Grinnell campus.

Here a fella puts out good
dough for some luee, flowers,
or candy and according to cus-
tom, should be in a position to
expect something extra elierce
from his date the next week-
end. But what happens? The
guy doesn't even have a date
the next weelacnd. WHY?
Because all the gals are dune-
in; with each other at the Con
loninl ball.

r, .t s
NEWS OF THE WEEK: The
gals in the Quad may have their
pictures of Robert Taylor, but ru-
mor has it that as far as Beulah,
of the College Shop, is concerned
she'll take Dibble-s Earl Mclgard.
