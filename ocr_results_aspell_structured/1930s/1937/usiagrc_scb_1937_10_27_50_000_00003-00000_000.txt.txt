Cross-Coun+ry
Team in Drills

for Tuior Duel

The varsity cl‘ossrcountry team
has started the week with heavy
workouts in preparation for a
dual meet with Iowa state
Teachers college here Friday at
4:00p m., Roy Jensen, captain of
the team, announced today.

An intramural meet will
held Saturday, the freshman cross—
country team running at that
time, Jensen said.

The varsity has dropped two
meets so far, one to Iowa State
and the other to Cornell college,

foot that Preston Evans, suffering
from a capular hemorrhage, may
not play, and if he does, he ivill
not he in top form. Hope was felt
Monday night, however, when tlie
search for a replacement ended
with Frederick Homann, who
looked mighty good scoring four
touchdowns through the freshmen
behind some very nitty blocking.
Cripples Set to Go

All the other cripples will be in
shape to go. Hayward, suffering
from a charley horse, will be all
right by Friday night. Jack as
born has nearly recovered from
his bad ankle, and will be ready
to play, although not at peak
form. Shelton will probably start
in his place after giving a great
exhibition at Washburn lastweek.
Moore and West, handicapped by
their late start, are catching up
with the rest of the team rapid~
ly, and will be able to supply
needed reserve strength.

It is probable that Drake will
concentrate most of their attack
around the guards and tackles,
hut Grinnell should be able to
handle this problem with seven
capable guards available, and
five good tackles eager for a
crack at Manders.

Lookahaugii Satisﬁed

Lookahangh Saturday expressed
partial satisfaction with the play
of the Pioneers against washburn.
After a bad first half, in which
the boys appeared listless, probab-
ly through overvconfidence, they
pulled out of the hole their fum-
bles had got them into and played
nice hall. The blocking, especially
donwf‘leld blocking, was excellent
in spots, and the tackling was

SPORT SHOTS -

This \vwkrend all eyes will
again be tocusscd on the forty»
fourth renewal of the Drake-
Grinncll rivalry, which by now
has become so hallowed With tray
dition that it drips with ivy. But
it is an interesting commentary
on the sportsmanship ot the two
schools, that such a rivalry, with
all its keeuness, can be preserved
over nearly a half-century, with
little friction between the two.

Naturally, Drake partisans are

 

this week expecting a rairly decisr
ivc victory, after Drake trounced
Iowa State so thoroughly last
week. But it is significant that
in all the history of the series, and
especially in these latter years,
no matter how poor one team was
on paper and how good the other,
the great majority of the games
have been won by reasonably
close scores.

A Drul‘wrGrinncll grime is one
of those unpredictable things. It
never is a good game to bet on.
simply because the team which is
the underdog usually goes in there
and plays its supreme ball game
of the year, Anyone who has seen
any of the last three games Will
vouch for that statement,

This Friday's game will probnlr
ly prove no exception to the
above generalizations, Grinncll
will enter the game definitely the
underdog. But you can rest as
siired that it Wlll be a ball game
all the way. We have an im»
proved ball club this year, capable
of playing the type of football we
haven’t seen here tor some time.
Don‘t worry about them, They'll
do all right.
