THE STUDENT AND HIS HALL

Grinnell's dormitory plan of several houses, each to accommodate
a comparatively small number of people, was arranged to promote
closer friendships—more intimate college life. But in order that the
occupants of individual houses might not form too well-knit cliques,
the arrangement of a connecting loggia was devised for both men's
and Women’s dormitories.

The student at Grinncll then has the advantages of sorority or
fratcmity life with the disadvantage minimized.

With residence in a dormitory comes responslbilityiresponslbllity
for creating a livable place for all and not alone for oneself. In fact,
the latter cannot be accomplished unless the former has been brought
about. But the responsibility should not be irksome; only when neg-
lected. does it become that.

Included among the courtesies which cannot be'shil‘ked, parti-
cularly in the intimacy that is dormitory life, are quiet during study
hours and willingness to share parlor facilities and other residence
equipment.

Loyalty to one's own hall helps make the intramural program,
the social program and other activities more enjoyable for all, When
hall officers are elected it should be with the understanding that they
may expect very real support from everyone.

But not only there duties to special projects undertaken by the
whole residence, but also the duty of each person to make the life
of his nextooor—neighbor or the person living two flights down
more pleasant.

Marjorie Hillis may be able to “live alone and like it” in a single
apartment but the person who stays by himself in a dormitory and
has no thought for others happiness will surely NOT like it.

Apropos of the conference last week we are reminded of a state-
ment we read recently to the effect that the action taken by Pro

Brussels COULD be the first step toward the abolition of war.

Represented at that conference will be the six major naval

powers of the world as well as the major land power.
these is more powerful than all the small nations combined.
'them, therefore, rests the peace of the world.

Their representatives meeting around a single table may den
terminc, not only whether we have peace or war, but whether civili-
zation, as we know it, will continue to exist. The world will watch
with interest whether they do take such action, or stop the arbitration
of the Sino-Japanese situation,

It is not exaggerating to say that unless they do act our civili-
zation may not live to see another conference.

We can have PEACE. We dare not have WAR.

QUOTABLE QUOTES
(By Associated Collegiate Press)

“I have nothing to say about the European war situation. I
have nothing to say about the youth movement. I have made no
exhaustive analysis of economic trends nor have I developed any
profound theories, sound or otherwise, concerning the recent move—
ment toward development of totalitarian states.” Non-conformist
Prof. R. D. Scott of the University of Nebraska, recently returned
from a summer tour of Europe, tells reporters about the conclusions

he didn't draw.

Germany, Mexico, Bolivia, Nor-
way, Sweden and Denmark to be
asked to participate in the parlcy.
Japan has as yet not announced
whether she will take part.

The resignation of Dr. Hji-tlmar
Schacht, from his position as
Reich minister of economic affairs.
has been accepted by Hitler. The
resignation was not unexpected
but is significant in that it pro-
bably means a plan of economic
self sufficiency will be pursued at
all costs.

Henri De Man, a socialist and
former Belgian minister of fi-
nance, has accepted King Leo—
pold's invitation to form a new
cabinet for Belgium.

Empresideiit Hoover‘s speech in
Boston Tuesday night is being
taken as a possible bid for leader-
