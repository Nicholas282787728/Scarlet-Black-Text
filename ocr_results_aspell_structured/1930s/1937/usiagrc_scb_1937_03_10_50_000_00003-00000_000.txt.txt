Englishman Says Confidence Essential
to Successful World Disarmament

Arnold-Forster

Disarmament Problem
in Sixth Talk

BY WALTER ltowudv

That disarmament is possible
by agreement only in those areas
where confidence exists; that it
is iinpossihle without collective
secur y; that it cannot survive
if it is one sided: and that gen-
eral disarmament will remain inc
tangible unless there is a good
collective system advanced, were
the opinions of w. Arnold-For-
ster, British labor-ite. in the sixth
of his series of eight lectures on
international relations givenWedr
nesday evening in Herrick chapel.
He spoke on the subject of “Gen—
eral Disarmament."

"There , must be
alliance in stopping the arms
race," the speaker declared
“Equality is substantial to suc-
cess in this respect," He added
that if America wishes to stop
the arms race now in progress,
she will have to pay lier part of
the price.

Describes Present mice

In telling of how the present
armaments race came about, the
speaker reviewed the efforts of
many of the great powers to
come to agreements in the limi-
tation of arms, and of how, in
certain instances, these efforts
were thwarted by rising dictatorc
ships and by lack of cooperation
between the great powers.

He pointed out that the killing
power of the world has multiplied
sevenafold since the last war, and
that treaties on arms limitations,
made since the war, are nearly
all gone today.

Huge Expenditures

In discussing the vast amount
of expenditures made on arms»
ments in the past few years, he
stated that, if 510 per minute
were put away since the time of
Christ, such would be the amount
spent on armaments by all the
great powers last year, and that
by next year the expenditures will
amount to about 515 per minute.

He asserted that Great Britain,
alone, spent $100,000,000 on arms
in 1933, that it is spending 5200,-
000,000 now, and that the ex-
penditures may rise to about
$400,000,000 in 1038. He pointed
out that, whereas America was
fifth in arms expenditures, it is
now first, and illustrated by tell»
ing of the increase in America's
navy since 1893 when we had
only nine ships of over 4,000 tons.

Confidence Needed

In explaining the fact that con-
fidence is necessary for successful
disarmament, the speaker said
that the states of our union, for
example, renounced the right to
make war upon one another by
the Constitution, and that the
Monroe doctrine lwu actually a
collective security experiment.

“Disarmament can he achieved
only when cautious but effective
cooperation is given,” he declared.

Reviews Efforts

He then reviewed the efforts
of some of the great powers to
place limitations on armaments,
and told of how in 1932, when
the armaments conference began,
an attempt was made to abolish
the use of tanks over 25 tons
and to eliminate weapons dealing
with long range attack.

The speaker declared that, al-
though Germany agreed to dis-
arm at that time, she would not
subscribe to any new treaty dis-
tinguishing other powers from
Germany. He added that a dras-
tic disarmament proposal made
by Pres. Herhert Hoover in June,
1932 finally resulted in the walk»
out of Germany, who did not re»
enter the conference until Hitler
came to power. The speaker
termed the Germany that came
to Geneva at that time "a differ

also failed, he said, and the con-
ference adjourned fatally. He ads
dad that Britain, France and the
United states, however. finally re-
verted to the technique of 1932
and entered in a ~ivate discus-
sion on the question of putting
Germany on probation for several
years. Germany, however, refus-
ed to cooperate unless given a
small limited air force for tive

years, the speaker said.

Carole Lombard says:
"Advised by my singing coach, I
changed to Luckies”

"In my new picture tSwing, High,
Swing Low’ I sing a song for the ﬁrst
time since I have been on the screen.
To do this, I spent months taking
singing lessons. And with this added
strain, my throat was not in good
shape. My singing coach suggested
that when choosing cigarettes, I select
a light smoke. And so I changed
to Luckies. Since then I’ve found
that a light smoke and my throat get
along together just ﬁne.’ ’

PICTURES‘ “SWING HIGH, SWING LOW”

An independent survey was made recently
among professional men and women—lawyers,
doctors, lecturers, scientists, etc. Of those who said
they smoke cigarettes, more than 87% stated they
personally prefer a light smoke.

Miss Lombard veriﬁes the wisdom of this pref-
erence, and so do other leading artists of the
radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
then" fortunes. That‘s why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
tection of Luckies—a light smoke, free of certain

harsh irritants removed by the exclusive process
"It’s Toasted”. Luckies are gentle on the throat.
