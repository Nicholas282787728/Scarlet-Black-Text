Valley teams in general took a
walloping at the hands of outsld»
ers this week as Washington
went down before Southern Meth-
odist. 144); Texas Christian took
care of Tulsa 20713; Mississippi
gave hope to other Valley teams
by downing St. Louis U. 2170;
and Arizona beat the Aggies 22-
13. Only two conference games
were played, Creighton sliding up
third place from the cellar hy vir-
tue of a 6'0 defeat of a fighting
Grinnell team, and Drake improv-
ing its first place position by
downing Washburn 2570. Drake
now has two wins and no losses
to its credi Oklahoma A. & M.
has won one game and lost none,
and Creighton has split a pai

In games next week, the Pio-
neers will meet central college
from Pella. 1a., on the home
grounds; Oklahoma should be able
to take Washburn; St. Louis will
try and handle South Dakota uni-
versity; Drake and Creighton will
clash in the feature battle of the
day. Should Creighton win this
one, it would mean a tie between
the two for first or second place,
depending on the outcome of the
Oklahoma AggieSrWashbum game.
In other games, Tulsa will play
Rice Institute, and Bradley Tech
will meet Washington.

us than any team they play all
year,” he said. “Naturally they’ll
be playing their hardest."

It's still too early in the week
‘to think about changes in the
starting lineup or tactics to be
employed against Central, Looker
baugh said. Practice sessions this
week will he the determining
factors.

SPORT SHOTS

Oddments: AS rumored here last
week. Ralph West has returned to
Grinncll and the football sq ad.
The question now is his eligib ity.
He was enrolled for a few weeks
at Oklahoma U., and there is some
question as to whether, seeing
that he transferred back here be-
fore the end of the first grade
period he will be able to play this
year. Prof. Earl D. strong, execu»
tive secretary of the conference,
has mailed ballots to other mem-
bers of the conference faculty
committee. There is no definite-
valley rule covering the subject,
but a precedent was established in,
a somewhat similar case several
years ago. It is quite likely that
West will be ruled eligible,

Some of the boys have been
working on Paul Grange, who vis-
ited the campus this weekend, to
enroll here. Grange, during his
high school days at West Water—
loo, was an allstate star in both
basketball and football, and lost
year was regarded as the best
blocker on the University of Iowa
grid squad. He’s a very flashy
ball handler on the hal'd~coux't,
and a dead shot, and in football
he‘s a vicious blocker and tackler.
But it is extremely doubtful that
he will come to Grinnell. There
are academic and financial diffi-
culties.

We didn't get to see the Creigh-
ton game Friday, but the consenr
sus among students who saw the
game is that Grinnell would quite
probably have beaten the Joys on
a dry field. The talk has it that
Creighton‘s running attack on dry
ground would have been little
more effective than it was on that
wet field. but that with a dry ball
the Pioneers' passing attack could
have been opened up very effec-
tively. The boys did a good job,
anyway.

Anent that game, we reproduce

crmom. senior quarterback,
and Jack Osborn, senior
guard.

Neither is likely to start
the game, but both probably
will be called upon to contri—
huto their efforts to the cause
of the Pioneers.

For its enrollment, Grinnell
probably draws more Nebras-
kons than any college or uni-
versity beyond the state bor~
dais. A very few of these mir
grants one athletes. Grinnell
has been lmown for years its
an institution with academic
standards.

Equally old is Grinnell's
fine reputation on the fields
of athletic contest. Itivals that
welcome Pioneer squads to
their campuses know theyare
greeting thorough sportsmen.

Among the college’s 400
male students enough talent-
ed players can seldom be
found to wage highly success-
ful campaigns in football
against rivals whose enroll-
ments are generally much
greater. But Grinnell usually
manages to wage hard eon»
