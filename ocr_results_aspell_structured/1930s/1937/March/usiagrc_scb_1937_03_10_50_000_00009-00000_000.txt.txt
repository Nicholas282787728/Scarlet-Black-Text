J British Lecturer Discusses Type
of Security in Case of War

Arnold - Forster Suggests
U. S. Cease Hindering
Peace Efforts

Ashing what the United States
should do in regard to collective
security to maintain world peace,
W, Arnold-Forster, British laborv
ite, Tuesday night made two
points in suggesting an answer to
the question: first, that America.
instead or resorting to isolation,
should enter into a conference
with international powers in time
of crisis; and, second, that an in-
discriminating embargo should
be declared during the conference
but lifted later. Mr
ster spoke in Her ich chapel on
“Isolated or Collective Security
Again War."

”What America needs to do,”
the speaker declared, “is to take
the monkey wrench out of the
works. The United states should
not wreck the efforts of other
powers on this question. If it will
not join them in these peace
building efforts, it should at least
make an effort to stop blocking
the work of others."

Cooperative Security Needed

He added that there is only one
kind of securityicoopel'ative sc-
curity to defend an agreed rule of
peace. In discussing the form, he
listed three points involved in ace
operative sccurit

1. Mutual confidence, such as
exists between the United States
and Canada.

2. Collective
peace.

3. Some collective measures to
prevent and to stop war.

He illustrated mutual confi~
deuce by telling of modern police
methods. Today, he pointed out,

organization of

Al'noldrFolu ‘

 

traffic officers play a smali part
in traffic control; instead, the
traffic light has replaced the offi-
cer. He declared that this is the
type of confidence now needed—
that nations should resort to rear
son rather than to force.

Moons ol Promoting Security

In listing ways in promoting
positive security. he mentioned
moral disarmament, renunciation
of war as a means of change, free-
dom of the seas as Wilson desired,
disarmament itself, and eoono
disarmament by taking the pro
fits out of peace and war.

Turning to negative security,
the speaker said that he assumes
that all mm]: of coercion are an
evil, and added that the
question of the problem involves
the fear of nations of strengthen-
ing their opponent by disarming.
