Speaker Suggests
Future American
Neutrality Policy

Pursuance of a “good neigh-
bur" policy, maintenance of a
strict neutrality. and cooperation
with all nations seeking to pre-
vent war were advocated for
America by Prof. George Strat-
toii. professor emeritus of psy-
chology at the University of Cal-
ifornia, in his address in Herrick
chapel last night.

Professor Stratton. who spoke
on the topic. “America's Stake in
the European Decision," has just
returned from Europe where he
has been investigating current
conditions which might provoke a
world conflict,

In discussing the possible diffi-
culties of America’s remaining
neutral in the advent of a war.
Mr. Stratton drew an analogy be-
tween the United States’ prob-
able position and that of Den-
mark and Sweden during the
last great conflict. He declared
”even in the event of our remain-
ing neutral. it will he impossible
for us to avoid the resulting d
tortions of our economic. pol

, cal. social and moral life."

Whether these changes would
be detrimental or not can not
now be determined. according to
the speaker. but that they will
occur is a foregone conclusion.

By scurry McLEOD

Lady Luck. fickle patron of the
Crinnell athletic department.
floored the Pioneers with a blow
below the belt and then turned
around and picked them up again
this week.

Hopes for a win over Iowa.
State Teachers Saturday night at
Crlnneh received the rude Jolt
when Wilbur Luick. six-foot five-
inch center. sprained his ankle in
practice Thursday night. These
same hopes were raised again
Friday when Athletic Director
John C. Truesdale announced that
Vernon Cornish. six»foot three-
inch Sterling Morton Junior col-
lege transfer. had received his
diploma from the junior college
and would be eligible to play Sat—
urday night.

Ineligible Earlier

Cornish. who was declared in«
eligible by the Missouri Valley
conference in December. straight»
ened out his difficulties and se-
cured a certificate of graduation.
automatically becoming eligible.
He will understudy Luick at cen-
ter and is expected to play at
least a third of the Tutor game.

The pioneers will need all the
strength they can muster at the
center position in order to stop

Abandons Plan
to Publish ‘Cyclone

Proposed plans for the sponsor-
ship of the Cyclone. college year-
book. by the Student council have
been definitely dropped for this
year. it was announced today by
Allan Rossman. president of the
body.

Investigations conducted by Mr.
Rossman and members of the Stu-
dent council showed that while
there was considerable interest in
the proposal for an annuol. still
no adequate financial and editorial
arrangements could be made that
would make possible the publicise
tion of a book this year.

“We have all hoped that it could
have been published this year. but
conditions being such. it would
seem only foolish to piihiish a
yearbook iinicss we all could feel
satisfied that it would be one wor-
thy to be called such, and one
which we could feel sure wouldn't
experience the tragic conclusion
that the last one did." Mr. Ross-
inan said.
