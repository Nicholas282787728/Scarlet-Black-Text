Athletic Department Prays
for Change of Fortune in 1937

BY WELLS BARNETT i
The New Year means turning;
over a new loaf and starting with;
a clean slate fol a lot of people;
and the Grinncll athletic deparL-‘
meat is beginning to hope that
Lady Luck, the fickle damsel who
did nothing but frown at Grins.
nell's coaches and teams last
year, is turning over a new leaf
in her relations with the sports
department.

Lady Luck took an intense dis-
like to Grinnell athletic teams
last year, starting to weave her
disagreeable spell early in the
year when she sent Julie Bauer
to the hospital with a recurrence
of a football injury, and finishing
off by wrecking the preseason
chances of this year's cage quin-
tet just a few days before Christ-
mas vacation.

l-lolch Lost to Swimmers

Immediately after Bauer was
lost to the cage squad last Janu-
ary, Lady Luck winked at Sam
Holch and he was lost to the
swimming squad for the season
because of a hand infection.
Then in the spring Lynn Schlotr
terbeek hurt his ankle at Notre
Dame, and ruined his effective-
ness in track for the rest of the
year, while Bill Sampson, a shot—
putter, was forced to retire with
a bad appendix.

But the prize hardluck story of
the year is that put out by Guy
Lookabaugb, head football coach,
who lost 18 varsity men for all
or part of the season last fall.
Included in that list were sootty
McLeod, Dayl Evans, Fred Luth-
er, William Fort, Joe Woodward,
Harry Barker, Ed Vaughn, Wil-
lard White, Robert Close, Richard
Moore, Harry Livermore, James
Wallace, Lynn Schlotterbeck,
Preston Evans, Fred Homann,
Ricky Boiler, Howard Wittrock,
Bill Sampson, Robert Douglass.
All these men were lost for one
or more games with the exception
of Ricky Boiler, who played for
a time despite his injured hip,

games because or it.
Story Doesn't End

BtIL that doesn't end the sail,
sad story. Before the swimming
season ever started this Winter,
George cisa, counted on to be
one of the strongest memhe- of
the team, was forced to return
home for the rest of the season.
And in basketball Robert Berry
and Wilbur Luick were declared
ineligible for the first game, and
hurt his shoulder
again and put himself out of
competition for the rest of the
season.

There are a lot of headaches
in that list: But perhaps the New
Year with its infinite possibilities,
will change the situation and
give Grinnell a few good breaks
to make up for all those bad
ones, At least the athletic de-
partment is sending up a lot of
fervent prayers to that effect.
