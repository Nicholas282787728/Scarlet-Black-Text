By FRANCES C. HANSEN

“Business" on the Scarlet and
Black is a lot more than the mere
soliciting of advertising which
most people consider it. It in-
volves layingrom. and writing the
ads, too, as well as a great deal
of detail work in collections and
circulation.

Bennett L, Brink, business mane
ager of the Semirweekly paper. he-
gins his work on Monday and
Thursday afternoons by issuing
orders to his staff, members of
which are Mary Bergc, Al Franz,
Dorothy Stewart, Gene Games, and
Robert Whitley. Stanley Tolbert
is circulation manager.

oh those afternoons they lay‘
out ads which they think will in
terest local merchants, featuring
some product which each is anxV
ious to sell. Laying out the ads
consists of drawing a sketch of it
to exact size, and filling in the
drawing with text, known as‘
“Copy,” in approximately the same
manner as it will appear in the
paper.

Some soliciting is done at the
same time, but most of it is done
on Tuesdays and Fridays, when
staff members interview the mer-
chants and display the ads al-
ready drawn up. The merchant
often 0, k.‘s the an as it stands,
or suggests some changes.

By 7 o’élock that evening, the
business manager notifies the
managing editor of the approxi-
mate total of advertising for the
next day, so that the editor may
know how much space he will
have to fill with news.

Most of the copy is set on the
linotype machines at the Grinnell
