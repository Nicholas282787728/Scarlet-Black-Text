Reported on Injured

another non-conference but tradi-
tional grid foe7Coe college from
Cedar Rapids, 1a., which will en-
gage Grinnell in combat Friday
at 2:30 p, m, on Ward field,
Only One Injury

Only one injury resulted from
the Carleton game. Jack Osborn,
just recovered from an ankle in-
Jury, suffered a badly injured
hand, and will probably not be
used against the Kohawks. In
addition, there is a little doubt
about the condi on of Ricky Bol-
ler, who is suffering from a foot
injury which kept him from
practice most of last week and
from the game Saturday,

The scouts are saying that
Coe has a good ball club despite
their defeats by Comell and
Carleton, both of which were also
victors over the Pioneers. The
team has been improving rapidly
all season since Cornell put them
down 7-6,

Most of Coe’s attack is based
on speed and deception, rather

impressive at times, At the
spearhead of their passes is Cis-
