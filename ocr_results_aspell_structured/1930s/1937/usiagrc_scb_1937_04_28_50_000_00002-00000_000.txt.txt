CHARITY BEGINS IN ENGLAND

The great American practice of bailyhooing every event, has at
last taken root in another country, and it begins to look as though
the English coronation will make our own attractions look sick,
Every day we read in the papers that Mr, and Mrs. John Q. Public
will sail on the S. S. Umpty Ump this week tor England where tiiey
will attend the coronation. Somehow or other this picture of hun»
dreds of Americans rushing to England for the coronatlon of a king
they know little or nothing about, strikes us as being funny.

0: course some of the English must be serious about the Oscar
sion, but it looks to us as though the majority of them have seen
their golden opportunity and are taking it. AL least one English peei-
has warned the Americans that they are bell-g played for suckers,
We doubt if his warning will cause many returned ticke ~ for as
Barnum used to say, “There's one horn every minute." Perhaps it he
were still with us we would he staging a counter attraction, out
under the circumstances we're betting on the British.

THE GREATEST THING IN THE WORLD

When one of our Grinnell professors says, "Health is the greatest
thing in the world,” we sometimes laugh and take it lightly. He has
been telling that to his classes for 30 years, we think. He told the
same thing to our mothers and fathers years ago when they were

students in Grinnell.

Yes, too often we take it lightly, not because we rail to realize
the truth in it, but because it is a traditionisomething we look fo
ward to hearing and something we would be disappointed it we did
not hear. We expect to have the professor say to us, “Health is the
greatest thing in the worl

But in all seiiousness, isn't it the truth? Just now many men
and women With great potentialities have failed to make a name for
themselves and have failed to accomplish great things simply because
they did not have good health, no one knows.

There is our great president, Woodrow Wilson, whose poor health
shattered his plans for bringing peace and friendship to the nations
of the world. Then, there arc the examples of those who gained or
regained their health and went ahead to make a great name for
themselves in the eyes of the world. There are the Roosevelt _.
T.R. and FDR. They overcame their handicap 0[ poor health and
became presidents of the United States.

We have the aged Senator Carter Glass of Virginia and Senator
George Norris of Nebraska, who, despite Ineir age, are able to serve
the nation because they are in good health,

Glenn Cunningham overcame his handicap and achieved great
success in the world of athletics. We have the great English sculpr
tor, John Flafman, who was a weakling as a chlld and who gained
his health and became the greatest sculptor that England has known.
Thomas A. Edison was handicapped by poor health during his ch
hood, but when he had overcome that handicap, he became America's
greatest inventor.

“Health is the greatest thing in the world," Isn’t it the truth?

e A Column oi Guest Ideas

It seems a pity that some guys'
gals can’t take eaie of them and
they have to form this “He de ho"
organization. In order to join the
gal has to kiss all the charter
members, If I wercirt so disgust»
ed with Warner, Conkling, Nich-
ols, et at, rd ask my giil if 1

'th hinu ho: -d that J. D.

sp 1 anard at tho, Brown
Derby (or asking fool queS»
tirins in clrs. Sort of n cross
between the leather in lul,
the Derby, and the mystery
:miu'iL

Several or the lads who are
outstanding candidates for the
Derby have been haunting the lie
hrary of late. Baxter Randall
Smith, a connrmcd laggard. has
been seen coming out of the
stacks laden with material, as
have Fritzy Schmidt, Dicky Poole
ey. Buckley Wuckley and Jerry-
boy Bauer.

*Thih lironn bonnet award
is the one that h us styan
iell, so the only thing to do is
to put all the league Bonrd
mum‘s in a hat and than
drnw. Just like pinning a tail
on n donkey.

I suppose we had better say
something about this guy Coggie
before he shoots himself for pub:
licity, although there are many
that claim we should let nature
take its course, in tact, provide a
small calibre shooting iron. We
think it is the lowest kind of
trick to involve the sacred name
ot Bismark in such a gross com-
mercial venture as the so-cailed
Bismark Memorial fund Where’s
the editorial board anyway?

sin-inn Chittendcn, Doric’s
pin-ate riding instructor, has
again announcod that he will
not enter the sweepstakes.
This comes as a great blow to
tl sweepstakes committee
who knows well n .u draw-
illg card Abriun i From the
looks of the car entries the
gals are ﬁnding it no any
to do lor their tickets this
your. The females outnumber
the nudes :2»1.

We have it on good authority
that this blanket to be given
away Saturday at the Derby is an
allwool Amalia number that is
really worth the money. It is
certified by the mills, but is
guaranteed untested. it is a
shame that it had to rain all
this week so that the glamour
boys couldn’t strut their stuff in
the stretch drive for the benefit
ot the committee. Selection is
likely to have to be largely by a
matter of hearsay.

Next week your old Doric
editor will iwetlrily write his
last column and announce his
successor. it mt 'not he the
lust ’ the new kid proves to
be as chicken hearted as in
the past iew weeks. “I got it
lotto ii-ientls," she says pathoe
tically.

COLLEGIATE REVIEW
Growth rings on baby teeth
have been discovered by Dr. Isaac

Schour, of the college of dentistry
at the University of Illinois. These
rings, he states, show a relation-
ship to the child’s age.

The gift of $500,000 to Brown
university from Jesse H. Metcztlf,
a. member of the univerSlty'S board
of trustees, will be used to build
and endow a laboratory ”with un-
surpassed facilities” for research
in the fields of Electra-chemistry
and photo-chemistry.
