Arabic Alphabet
Found Similar to
Chicken Tracks

Eleven students turned out
Thursday night to further their
knowledge in Arabic.

Having been

Manhattan String

Ria Ginstcr, soprano

tructor. they sat

taring at the

lack board while

. the professor

:halked up the

Arabic alphabet,

According to

. one of "Prof.

SAID Sejd’s" students,

the language of enchantment and

mystery looked like a series of

chicken scratches; yet there was

little doubt that this was the lan-

guage that lured beautiful women

and made them easy prey to dash-
ing young shieks.

With the alphabet on the board.
the "professor” proceeded to go
into great detail on the vowels
of the language. which turned out
not to be letters. but little dashes
distributed along the tops of the
letters.

“What’s The Use '2"

Class members were assured
apparently. that even these were
not used when the language ap-
peared in the newspapers. all of
which led one student to say as
an aside. “What’s the use of
learning them. then?”

The professor did not appear to
be pleased with the work of the
members of the first class. who,
it Seems, did not study for their
lesson. as they could not distin-
guish “Tbs" from “Dha.” or give
any of the other letters.

Lecture

“Prof.“ Said concluded his les-
son by giving a short lecture on
“The Races of Arabic Speaking
Countries."

For the next assignment. the
old students were told to learn
the alphabet “or else." and the
new students were instructed to
try to learn it before the next
meeting.

the University of Iowa is 24 to o
heating in answer to a blanket
challenge issued by the Iowa City
aggregation, and the first inter-
collegiate fcothsll game west of
the Mississippi rivcr became a
matter of record. It was the only
game on Grimlell's schedule.
Can Grinnell do it again? They

Grinnell (then iowa college) Nov.
16. 1889, in a vacant lot back of
Blair hall here. The field was
roped off to keep the spectators
off. No admission was charged.
but the team manager "passed
the hat" both before and after the
game. taking in about $10. The
money was used to buy the Grin-
nell gridders new jackets.

A story of the game in the
Grinnell News Letter. the stu-
dent paper at that time. said:

“The Pioneer team presented
anything but an appearance that
was beautiful. In fact. a moi-c
heterogeneous collection of old
clothes than they possessed never
disgraced an intercollegiate con-
test. Two only had regulation
football pants. The others wore
sweaters. gym jerseys. last sum-
mer's outing shirts. bicycle pants
and one a pair of genuine blue
jeans overalls. 'I'he visiting
elevcn was more fortunate, in
point of apparel at least. They
were fairly radiant in unspotted
suits of white canvas."

“Conlied Canaries"

Notes on the game carried by
the News Letter commend the
Pioneer line. saying it was like
“the Rock of Ages-there to
Stay." “The S. U. I. boys.” the
story says. “Came down to bag a
few of our cornfcd canaries. and
had us all scared before the game
because of their size and bulk. but
they could not run or dodge.”

The lineups of that first game
looked odd today because of the
peculiar positions assigned the
players.

Quarter

Scarlet and Black)7Drake'S
mighty Bulldogs used every offen-
Sive weapon at their command
here Friday night and over-
whelmed the Pioneers in a bar-
rage of touchdowns by a 45-7
score. .

only one distinction remained
for the Pioneers. Their lone
touchdown was the only one scored
against Drake this year. with the
exception of those scored bchtre
Dame in their 21--o defeat of the
Bulldogs. Beyond that the Pio-
neers were completely at the
mercy of a Drake team which
must certainly be considered in
any mythical all-state honors.

Hayward Takes Pass

Grinnell’s points were scored
late in the fourth quarter when
big! John Hayward intercepted a
Drake pass around the 50-yard
line and returned it to the Drake
one-foot line. Homann drove
across for the score. and Scblct-
tcrheck place-kicked the extra
point.

Drake kicked off to Grinnell.
and after five minutes of ineffec-
tual sorties for both teams. Suter
returned Homann’s quick-kick to
thc Grinnell 40-yard line. Manders
went first to the 30. then to the
22. Underwood went to the four-
yard line. and Manders scored.
Phil Manders converted to make
the score 7-0.

Manders Brothels Score

Shortly‘after this drive. the
Bulldogs started another sortie
down the field which ended in an-
other score for Drake as Manders
drove across and Phil Manders
converted. Score. 14-0. Immedi-
ately after this score, Peterson in-
tercepted a pass for Drake and
returned it to the Grinncll 30-
yard line. Seven plays meant an-
other touchdown, but the conver-
