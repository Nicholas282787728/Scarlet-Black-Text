PREPPING FOR WOMEN

With freshman men’s prepping successfully out of the way
attention now turns to prepping for women which has been scheduled
to begin Nov. 4.

Rigorous hazing has never been the practice for this group nor
is it now intended to he so. However, as the plans have now been
formulated, prepping will be more extensive than previously.

An editorial in the September 29 issue of the Scarlet and Black
mentioned several tradi onal courtesies due upper-classmen from
freshmen. It was emphasized that these rules of etiquette were not
to be considered a method of establishing campus autocracy, but
were merely the usual social custom.

The prepping program has been designed to emphasize these
social rules for freshmen in their relations with upperclassmen. The
Women's League board is to be commended for its efforts to 1'97
establish the custom on this campus.

As a coordinator of the prepping for both men and women, it
might be useful to establish something like a senior walk or a bench
and level a penalty for any freshman caught using it. This is an
age-old tradition in many colleges and creates a good deal of com-
»mendabie class spirit.

Prepping has a very definite worthy place on any college campus
when carefully administered, For that reason any continued
squeamishness on the subject of having prepping is unwarranted as
the men have shown.

LIVING, NOT Gilllllﬁiﬂf

President Eugene A. Gilmore of the University of Iowa pointed
out to the students in a recent address that they are not getting
ready for life after college, but that they are living this life already.

The president admonished the college students to “be present-
minded, to live wholeheartedly to the full extent of your capacity in

the present.” He continued by saying, “In all probability students
never will be in an evironment more favorable and stimulating to a
full and rich life. There is no such thing as college life. There is
life in college. There is no such thing as college ethics and morals
in college. Right is right; wrong is wrong; stupid and futile think-
ing is just the same in college and out of college."

Everyone, and especially those of us who are in college now, can
find food for thought in this message of President Gllmore's. We
should realize that life is a matter of living to the best/of our ability
each day as it comes. It is subject to certain laws which are in
effect all the time, no matter what conditions we are living under.
It would be well for all of us to keep in mind these suggestions that
President Gilmore gave as a guide to full living.

A BIG MAN

Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes of the supreme Court has
shown that he is big enough to take defeat gracefully. When asses
ciate Justice I-Iugo Black took his seat, Hughes went out of his way
to be friendly to thc new justice though he had opposed Black’s
appointment as he had opposed many of tlic things Black cham~
pioned.

In view of the feeling which has existed between the justices
heretofor, the Hughes overtures of friendship speak volumes for the
new atmosphere of the court.

“Superliciality is the most undesirable characteristic of a large
state university locatcd in a small town." Prof. Howard MCCluskey
of the School of Education, University of Michigan, cited evidence or
this supci-ficiality in the ovcrdresscd women students and the stereo-
typed ”line."

Sin young men from the north
end lit out for thc great city late
the other night. since they hadn't
bothered to drcss, they gained one
trance to the places by sending
one pajama-clad lad ahead, arm
extended, eyes staring, slcep-wallc
ing, The others would follow
forthwith, under pretense of seek-
ing the first. Thus they passed
from joint to joint until the dawn
stained the east.

And another roommate from the
same end of the same floor was
stood up by ia Bergren last week.
He should have profited by his
roommates experience, But they
all come back for more; such
popularity mu be deserved.

We say that the comeliest pro-
file in these halls of learning be-
iongs to one Cassie Ruth Emp-
field, freshman.

Monday, amid the enthusiastic
crowd of seniors at the annual
class meeting (the usual 18 mem-
bers present), to the sound of La»
