FORMING AN ATTITUDE

In two weeks Grinnell will play the role or host to delegates from
almost 100 colleges and high schools at the time of the International
Relations conference.

This year interest in the conference should run at fever- pitch.
Never before in the seven years of the history of this annual affair
has the world been so close to a general war.

Only this week events in the United States have finally Shaped
themselves to point to 3. very definite attitude toward War on the part
of this country. An article in Friday’s Des Moines Register announces
that the only topic of conversation in Washington now is “WAR,"
and that rumors run rampant in Wall street declaring the president
seriously considers a 32,000,000,000 armament program. The article
continues that the feeling of apprehension has not been so marked
since the days of 1917.

With such a picture of fear and ccnﬂict before us, it can scarcely
be possible that any studEDt on the campus Will fail to realize the im—
portance to him of the forthcoming conference.

Some may Scorn the discussions as impotent in their ability to
change the course of the world. They may seem singularly insignifi-
cant when one Considers that less than 1,000 men and Women, meru
college students at that, will be participating in them. ‘

But! Do not lose sight of the fact that it is from the ranks of the
college students that men will be recruited. Without the aid of men
and women of college age it would be difficult for war to go on.

It is then up to these people to keep themselves well posted on
developments in foreign affairs so that they may form their attitude
toward War knowing the full history and significance of each event.

The conference ‘presents Well informed men and women ranking
high in the realm of foreign affairs commentators. Attendance at
round tables and formal speeches will provide necessary and impor-
tant information to be used as a basis for YOUR opinion.

PLAN NOW

Rhodes Scholarships. the very words conjure up for most of us
visions of the chance to study at the University of Oxford in England,
fellowship with outstanding students of all countries, seeing Europe,
in brief, fine scholarships that anyone would like to have.

This month is the time that applications are received for Rhodes
Scholarships. some juniors and seniors will read the posters and turn
from them with regret because they, not through lack of ability but
lack of preparation, are not in a position to apply. others will apply
without thought of preparation and unless they have unusual ability.
they will be disappointed.

Yet it is unnecessary for many students to be unprepared to ap-
ply, The requirements require only that one be a scholar in spirit and
attainment, a leader, of good character, physically vrgprous, and fulfill
other general requirements to be elimhle.

Obviously one can not expect to win a scholarship by deciding
during junior year that it would be a nice thing to have.

0n the other hand, a good student can well expect to stand a
chance of winning a scholarshp, if, during his first two years in col-
lege, he plans his work with the scholarship in mind.

If you are now a junior or senior it is probably too late for you
unless you have previously given the matter some thought. You fresh»
men and sophomores, here is your chance, start now to plan for your
junior year and we hope your scholarship.

“A strenuous program of adult li mg brings one ultimately to
terms with life so that life reaches fulfillment. The central business
of a college is to produce adults. The central business of'the adult
mind is to come to terms with life." Duties defined by Henry M.
Wriston, president of Brown university.

NEWS OF THE WORLD
INTERPRETED BY

John Spaulding

“The will for perm—must ex—
press itself—that nationsitemptr
cd to violate their agreements and
the rights of others will desistﬁ
There must be positive endeavors
to preserve the peace.” This state-
ment from President Roosevelt’s
speech at Chicago Tuesday started
conjecture as to the exact mean-
ing of the phrase.

The state department the next
day announced that Japan was an
outlaw and condemmcd in no une
certain terms her action. Thurs»
day Secretary Hull stated that the
United states would accept an in-
vitation to discuss the Far East»
ern situation at a League of Na-
Lion's conference.

a s a

Now the question in Washing»
ton and elsewhere i just what
does all this mean?

e e e

The President's speech and the
state department‘s announcements
are acclaimed as a great step to
ward peace by some. 0n the other
hand, there are those who claim
there is a suggestion of possible
war in the president's words, "let
no one imagine that America may
escape" (from war) if, as he says,
these acts of agression continue.
At least it seems sure that the
statements are a complete rever-
sal of our traditional isolation pol»
icy and contain a hint that we
shall act with force if necessary.

\- e e

Meanwhile in Europe is tam
and France join in threatening to
permit the sale of arms to the
Spanish government unless Muss-
olini will participate in s. tri-pcw-
er conference and recall Italian
soldiers now in Franco’s army.

Mussollni's only answer to date
has been a definite "no” to both
requests, To further prove his diss
regard of British and French
threats, be Friday dispatched
troops to Libya thus indirectly
threatening both countries' coloe

Delegates to the annual A. F
of L. convention to be held in _De 7
Vin next Week are unanimous in
their desire to expel the C. I. o.
from the organization. one group,
however, believes that it should
be formally expelled while another
group says it has already expell-
ed itself. Lewis’ actions of
late would seem to give ample
grounds for this latter opinion.

The racing yacht Endeavor,
missing since Sept. 13, when her
towline parted and left her free in
a bad storm, turned up in England
Friday. She had been given up for
lost but the hull, though not fast
enough to win the cup race. is ap-
parently seaworthy.

The American Bar assoclarion
has again gone on record against
one of President Roosevelt’s ac.
tions, this time in a resolution
that in the future public hearings
should be held an all judicial ape
pointmcnts.

GeorgevEdgerly

George Edgerly, of Smith hall,

certain when he will be released.

James LaMasney, a resident of
Clark hall, was released from
Community hospital Friday moms
ing after remaining there a day.
