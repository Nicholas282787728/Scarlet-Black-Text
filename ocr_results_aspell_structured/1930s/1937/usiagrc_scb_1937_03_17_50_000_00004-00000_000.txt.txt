A WORD 0F COMMENDATION

A word of commendation should go to
the Drama department and the Student
council for their combined efforts in making
semester fee books admit to the play,
“Spring Dance."

Both groups felt that there was a need
for a more balanced program which would
include drama activities as well as mllsic
and athletics. To this end, they worked
together in selecting a play and arranging
the budget to include such a project.

The student body appreciates such in-
stances of cooperation. It is to be hoped
that this practice of putting plays on the
semester fee will continue.

READ, TO DISCUSS INTELLIGENTLY

One of the accomplishments of the
Roosevelt administration, say what you will
against it, is the awakening of the American
people, momentarily at least, from their
lethargy in regard to public affairs. If Mr.
Roosevelt should succeed in arousing the
American people to an intelligent interest
in government, he will have indeed perform-
ed a Worthwhile service to this country. The
issues recently brought forward in connecA
tion with the reform of the administrative
and the judicial departments of the govc
ment have provoked a great deal of cl
cism both favorable and unfavorable.

Mr. Roosevelt does not have the tremen-
dous support of his court proposal as he did
of himself last November, and at this writ-
ing with the Senate Judiciary committee, in
which the president‘s plan is nolv being de-
bated. deadlocked 9—9, it looks like zl long
fight ahead for the president

What is the president’s plan '-‘ What
effect would it have on the power of the
court, the relative equality of our three de-
partments of government and the “balance
of power?” Thesc and other questions are
of yital importance in the consideration of
the plan. In the student discussions of the
subject we only scratch the surface with our
thinking.

Do not confine your reading to criticism
which agrees with your point of view. Our
best ideas come from adverse criticism If
you are against Mr. Roosevelt and his pro-
posed ohange read the Nation by all means.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

You will be irritated beyond all measure but
also stimulated. Read, “Will Roosevelt Win
the Court Fight?" an editorial by Paul W.
Ward in the Feb. 20 issue; also the article
by K. N. Llewellyn ill the Mar. 13 issue en»
titled “A United Front on the Court” and by
all means dig out the Feb. 13 issue from
back in the magazine stacks and read the
editorial “Purging the Court” If you are
all for Mr. toosevelt read “John L. Lewis’
Push to Power," an article in the March
Forum by Louis Adzll'rlic. In reading this
consider what Mr. Roosevelt’s plan would be
in the future in the hands of a man like
Lewis.

But these are only meager suggestions.
With the wealth of periodical literature in
the library in which there are and will be
from time to time articles on the Supreme
court we Should not lack for authoritative
and informative sources on which to base
ollr thinking. Road them, and be an intelli-
gent participator in the present discussion.

Other Opinions

YOU CAN LEAD A STUDENT To CLASS
(Daily Trojan)

“Now, class, we will have discllssmn?"

“Yes, we will go directly to thc dentist, math
or; ycs mother, we will eat our spinach; yes, moth-
or, we will get up at 5 a. m

“Yes, teacher, we will d lss.

Whether through laziness or a sense that stu»
dents retain more of the lecture if allowed to par-
ticipate in it, a small percentage of professors
cling to this artificial mnnncr of stimulating arti-
ficial interest.

The discussion that is precipitated when some
professor makes up his mind to interest students
at all lcost is n fruitless lgestureicven if it does
bring lo light a most artful beatingrabounthe-bush.

The inoreditable point of the matter is that
most teachers fail to sense the constant pressure
required by discussion if it is Lo continue. Most
students go to listen, not to talk. Talk is cheap
and much more entertaining when conducted along
University avenue.

You can lead a student to class, but you can't
make bim discuss.

“We are all products of a system which knows

to send him for his education helpless against the
environment itself.” The dirgc of Pres. Robert
