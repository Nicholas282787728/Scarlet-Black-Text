TOWARD BETTER PUBLICATIONS

Monday afternoon the faculty gave
final approval to a proposal to raise the
subscription allotment for the Scarlet and
Black which has been under consideration
since late last spring.

That this action is gratifying to us is
obvious. That it will make it possible for
us to gve you a better paper is equally true.
For that privilege and responsibility we are
grateful.

Aside, however, from our personal stake
in the decision we feel that it is a step to-
ward better publications of all kinds on
this campus.

An investigation of campus publications
now appears imminent The move of the fa-
culty and Student council is only a tem-
porary measure and there is-need for a
permanent solution to this ever-recurring
problem. Furthermore, there is a real need
on this campus for an annual and the en~
couraging attitude that is now present may
lead to some definite action in behalf of
such a publication. '

|.ET'S HAVE A MORATORIUM

In view of the recent developments in
the athletic policies of Grinncll college, the
editorial reprinted below, clipped from the
”Wisconsin Alumni Bulletin,” seems pan-ti-
culm‘ly pertinent We offer it in the sincere
hope that this Hessian of what we con-
sider a. healthy state of mind may be instin—
mental in shaping a similar attitude in the
minds of Gi'inncll students, faculty and
alumni.

As you read this, -Wisconsin will have
completed playing the first two games on
its tough 1937 schedule. Perhaps they won;
maybe they lost. In either event certain
overzealous alumni and friends will be
praising the team to the Skies, forecasting,
without the shadow of a doubt, a champion»
ship year. This will be nothing new, for it
happens every year, sometimes even before
the season gets under way.

‘ When I picked Wisconsin as my Uni-
versity, I liked the Wisconsin spirit. The
Wisconsin spirit meant more than enthusi-
asm for athletics. It meant honest and
high-minded thinking on all subjects that
touch life. It meant courage to seek, search
and discover, regardless of prejudice or the
smug protection of habit and let»well-
enough—alone.

In athletics, it meant sportsmanship. It
meant to fight for victory until the last
second of the game, by the strenuous ex-

THE GRINNELL SCARLETAND BLACK

ei'cise of every fail“ means to win, but win
01' lose, to accept the outcome in a gentle-
manly manner, Neither to sulk and alibi in
defeat nor to gloat in victory.

That is what Wisconsin means to me to
day. I don’t have to hang my head if Wis-
consin loses a football game. I don’t have
to watch my blood pressure when Wisconsin
wins. So long as Wisconsin teams play the
game for all that’s in them, I’m proud of
them. I think 99 out of every 100 Wiscon-
sin men and women feel the some way.

But why must we be embarrassed every
September by premature press reports of
the great stars on the squad, the great lines,
the great backfield , the likelihood that this
year Wisconsin will win the championship,
only to see, as the schedule progresses, that
we have just a fair team?

Let’s declare a moratorium on these Sep-
tember championships. Let’s realize that
Wisconsin is not a football factoryithat
the boys who make our teams are students
first. Let’s disregard the Superficial view-
point that a championship is all that counts
in athletics. Let's get back to on apprecia-
tioll of sportsmanship and be proud of the
Wisconsin team that gives all it has of
brains and guts, win Or lose. So long as
they fight, no matter what the odds, they
deserve their “W's."

THE STUDENT: HIS WORK AND PLAY

(Editor’s note: This is the fourth in a
series of cditoi‘ials dealing with the student
and his relations with various (lctit'tich

Much has been said in derision of the
student who grindsiso much in fact, that
today many have come to think of him as
a case in abnormal psychology. Such an
attitude is, of course, quite exaggerated, but
there is room for criticism of such a person
as one abnormal to the extent that he does
not live a welleroundcd life.

Studying is never to be considered a
“faux pas” either in student or later days.
But because of the emphasis placed on it in
college, many students lost their sense of
perspective and make it the sole purpose in
life.

It iS these people who too late find
themselves social misfits. And the situation
becomes more acute after graduation when
men trying to enter the business and pro—
fessional worlds find as a prime requirement
that of social ease.

Too late that person wishes he had
taken Wednesday nights off to attend Pio-
neer chorus, had devoted Monday after-
noons to Forensic or Saturday to speedball
practice.

It is these activities of which Grinnell
has a variety to offer that prove the man
and not merely his study hours. Very
naturally there is an extreme in the other
direction. The ”extra-curricular man" is
just as bad as the grind.

But going to college is neither of these
extremes. It is an activity from which the
most good can be obtained only by partici-
pation in all its phases: class recitation,
dances, lectures, dramatics and the rest.

The Greeks’ ideal of the “golden mean"
might well be that of every college student.
The man who gets ahead is the one who has
allowed himself to experience everything—
never in excess, always in moderationgthe
man who is too fair to allow himself pre-
judice against study or against play.

THE EDITORIAL BOARD.

“The chief hope of America's escaping the
rising tides oi .Ccmmunism and Fascism rests on
our public schools," Carl Wilde, Vice-president of
the Indianapolis School board has the same idea
as the American Legion when he scores the “isms"
as unrAmerlcan. “Our schools...must be free
...of political control and party propaganda.”

G——

“Is it not better preparation for American citi-
zenship lo solve problems of governmental regula»
tion of industry or credit buying than it is to solve
problems concerning equilateral triangles?” Dr. J.
Stanley Grey, psychologist at the University of
Pitmburgn, believes Pythagoras, Horace and the
Babylonians should be shelved in favor of social
studies ior high school students.
