Dibble Whips
Rawson. 2l-3

Dean Gets Seven Points
in Second Speedball
Tilt of Season

By Arthur Goshorn

Hal Dean scored seven points
and figured in the scoring of eight
more, as he led Dibble hall to a
21 to 3 victory over Rawson hall
in the second intramural speedhall

,game of the season yesterday.

The Dibble team displayed a
strong passing attack along with
a tight defense. Rawson showed
little offensive or defensive
strength and, except for a few
'minutes in the second quarter.
were helpless against their strong-
er opponents.

Dibble drew first blood when
they scored two points early in
the first quarter on a pass over
the goal from Dean to Mark Mor-
rison. Rawson took the lead in
the second quarter when Harlan
.iost kicked a goal for three points,
but Dean retaliated by scoring on
two passes, one to Dave Miller and
the other to Jerry Fort, giving
Dibble a a to 3 advantage at half
time.

Dibble scored alone point in the
third quarter on a free kick by
Dean. 1n the fourth quarter two
goals by Dean, one by Robert P.
Young, a pass from Dean to Mor.
rison, and a freak goal raised the
socre to 21 to 3 as the game ends
ed.

In a game Monday, Smith and
Clark halls played a close game
with Smith coming out on the long
end of a 4-1 score. A free kick
by Robert Berry and a goal by
John Turner accounted for Smith’s
four points, while Jim LaMasney
scored Ciark’s lone counter with a
free kick.
