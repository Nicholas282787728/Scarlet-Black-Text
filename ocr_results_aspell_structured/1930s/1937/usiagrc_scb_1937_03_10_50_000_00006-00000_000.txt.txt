Play Inspired Ball

The performance of the entire

throughout the last half with the
play steadily improving as the
strangeness of the large Drake
floor wore off during the second
period, Carcapfaln Dcan paced
the Grinnell offensive during the
entire game and especially during
the second half with an exhibition
of Ilnderrpressure shooting seldom
seen in Missouri Valley conference
circles. other offensive stars
were Conwill, who gained 13
points, mainly from beyond the
foul circle, and Luick. who after a
poor first half, sank four baskets,

Defensive stars were Co-captain
LaMasney, who spent most 0[ the
evening pursuing the elusive
Drake captain, Drebaugh, around
the floor. He held the highrscolk
ing guard to six points. Berry too,
played stellar defensive ball,

Suter and O‘Connor paced the
Drake offensive with 13 and 11
