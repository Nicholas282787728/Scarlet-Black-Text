Porter Speaks

Dwight Porter. president of the
council or house presidents, offi-
ciated at the flag raising ceree
mony on the campus in the ab-
sence of John spcnce, president of
the student council.

Porter spoke briefly on the
democratic spirit at Grlnnell and
urged cooperation of the student
body with its self governing ore
ganiaztions.

Democratic Ideals

“Grinnell. in contrast to some of
the colleges and universities of the
country, is a school which has
always stood and still stands for
the democratic ideals of the flag
which we have just raised,” Por-
ter said.

“In the student Council.” he
continued, “which is the integrate
ing force on the campusiin the
Women's Self-Government league
and the Council or House Presi-
dents, through which the women
and men of the dormitories are
press their ideas and put them in-
to practiceithis democratic spit»
it exists.

 

“But just as democracy rails,
once the citizens become too in-
different to its government, so
these organizations will slip and
end up by amounting to nothing
if they receive no support," Porter
went on.

run, will be ours."
