Any intelligent poison may earn

By MAX Ross

Grinncll basketball fans will have
a chance to see a youth tonight who‘
is perhaps the best sophomore pros»
pect ever developed at Creighton, He
is Cornic Collin, all-conference hillfs
back during the football season, who;
is leading the Creighton team in scor-
ing. While a freshman in high school,
Collin was awarded a place on the

*ll’dtion's allsAmerican selection.

s .. e

Fans also have it from in store for
them when they get n chance to
which Willard Schmidt, sihrfnot-
eight-inch center, in action. lib brings
to mind Brud Jensen, Creighton con»
ter of two years ago, who only hickcd
nu inch of Schmidt's height. The mills
west seems to have n iiionnpoly on
bill players, sincc Art Stocliing, Cell—
lrnl college, lrcshmmi, stands six-loci.
uineinches dud is probably the toll-
,est player in College basketball.

« x 9

Two years ago, as a sophomore,
Willie Worthing succeeded in been
ing Louie Trautman, then the Blue-
jay captain, out of his position. Now
Worthing is forced to step back to
a guard role to make room for the
sensational Collin.

Carleton college's record of 41 con-

‘scclitive rictories ml the home floor‘

is a mark for other teams to shootl
at. it is little wonder that rival team,
drcnd to play at the Northficld SCHOOL!
i- i s

Frank Duncan will learl the attack
against the Bluejays tonight. since
he needs all other Pioneer cagers in
points scored. He has a total of 43, ‘
while Don Rowe is second with 35.
Dick Ullrlch, guard, is third with 24
points, followed by Frye and Captain
McCreary with 17.
