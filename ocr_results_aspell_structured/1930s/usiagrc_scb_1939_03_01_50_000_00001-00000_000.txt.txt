Pledges Support to

Program' Presented
By Hall Presidents

The faculty administration coin—
mlttee has pledged its support to
the so-called “purge” campaign as
set forth by the Council of House
Presidents recently, it was
learned today from John H. Har-
ris, president of the council.

The action outlined by the
council was a, fine of $5.00 im»
posed on any student for posses—
sion of alcoholic beverages on
college premises or intoxication
within college ju diction.

Any student so fined will be
reported to the facility admin
trative committee, and the coun-
cil will recommend a course of ac-
tion to be followed.

Action for the first ‘ offense
will constitute probation for the
student involved. The second of—
fense will probably amount to sus
pension from the college.

The women's league board has
decided on similar action in in-
stances that might arise at the

Against Bulldogs

By Clark A. Smilh.

In the f in] game of the year
ilgalllst Dl'ﬂix'e Friday night
in Des Monies, SIX senio s will be

'gcttlng their last crack at their

greatest intercollegiate rival.

A Victory over the Bulldogs
will give the Pioneers undisputed
possession of third place in the
Missouri Valley. a fitting climax
to Grinnell's last year in the Val-
ley wars.

Senior Lcttenncn.

Capt. Robert Berry heads the
senior letter-men, with three years
of standout play at guard behind
him. Fred Luther, a great all-
around athlete, closes his career
as a flashy, high scoring forward.

Wilbur Luick, the giant red
headed center, will leave behind
him several scoring records that
Pioneer court performers will
probably be shooting at for many
seasons to come.

Neu- Scoring Record.

Little John Turner, the flashy
guard with the deadly pivot shot
also ends his career as a regu-
lar. The performances of these
men will long be remembered, as
they led a Crinnell team that
rolled up the greatest number of
points for a season's play in the
school‘s history. Vern Robinson
and George Tompkins are senior
squadmen ‘whose capable reserve
play will also be sorely missed.
