Like the prov ~bial month of
March, the 1929-30 Grinnell college
basketball season came in like a
lamb and went out like a lion.

The Pioneers started out. on a.
schedule of ﬁfteen games with 8. 22
to 15 victory over the Golden Aval—
anche of Marquette university here,
December 14, and closed the season
with a loss in an overtime game to
Tulsa. university at Tulsa, Okla, 30
to 27. Six. triumphs, four of which
Were taken by the Scarlet and Black
in home-and-home engagements with
two Missouri valley conference
teams, and nine defeats is the sum-
mary of the Grinnell basketball sea—
son just closed. Four of the wins
over Grinnell were eked out by only
a margin of three points or less-and
three of the victories went to the op-
ponents in extra-period games.

‘ Minnesota Wins

After winning from Marquette a
week before the 1929 Christmas v8.-
cation, the Grinnell basketball men
laid off a week and then resumed
drill for the game with the University
of Minnesota at Minneapolis, January
4. The Gophers doubled the count
and the Pioneers lost, so to 15.

The fast St. Louis university Billi-
kens invaded the Grinnell gymnasium
fox- a contest with the Scarlet and
Black the night before classes were
resumed after the Yuletide holidays.
Grinnell Went down to defeat before
the Missourians, 26 to 19. Oh Jane
uary 10 the cagers of Cornell college
ofMount Vernon were the foes of
Coach Truesdhle's, Grinnellians hem,
and the local quintet managed to be
on the long end of the score at the
ﬁnal Whistle, 15 to 13.

Lost to Marquette

A return game with Marquette was
sweet revenge for the Wisconsin
team, and Grinnell returned home
from Milwaukee lifter a 26 -to 22 loss.
The week-end of January 17 and 13
saw the Pioneers playing two
strenuous contests

in St. Louis, as

’ I Plan Swim Meet

Splash! Plop! Quad mermaids are
recalling the feel of northern waters
and frantically practicing their
strokes in preparation for the first
interclass swimming meet to be held
soon.

Freshman bathing beauties are
determined to out-swim the supho<
mores, while sophomores, juniors
and seniors are convinced that their
upperclnss dignity and training will
aid them in the pool contest.

Just which class contains the most
superb and capable mermaids will
soon be known, for each class will
contest with the other three in a
forty yard breast stroke, forty yard
free style, forty yard back stroke,
forty yard side stroke, 160 yard re.
lay, and 150 yard medley as well as
in diving and form swimming.

Earleen and Gordon Rosecrans of
Primghar were called home Thurs—

“Duck" Drake Twice

On the last evening of January
Coach Truesdale injected his revampv
ed Grinnell basketball lineup into the
game here with the Oklahoma Ag-
gies, and the Pioneers came through
with s 19 to 10 win after losing four
tilts in succession.

Four valley league games followed
on the Grlnnell 1930 basketball pro-
gram, and the Scarlet and Black took
two contests by three points and one
point and lost two tussles by one
point and two points. Drake fell be-
fore the attack of Grinnell at Des
Moines in a second extra stanza, 32
to 29; Creighton eked out a 21 to 20
triumph here; Capt. “Moose" Meyer
pulled his Washington university
mates through with a 19 to 17 vic-
tory over Grinnell in an overtime
period in the local gymnasium, and
Robert DeLong sank a basket within
the last ten seconds here to give
the locals their second 19le win over
the ancient rival, Drake, 16 to 15.
