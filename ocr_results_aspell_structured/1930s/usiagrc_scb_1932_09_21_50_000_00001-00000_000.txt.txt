Faculty Has
Six Changes
for 1932-33

Philip Chase to Come Here
Second Semester

from Harvard

Six additions and changes have
been made in the Grinnell curricu-
lum for the comig year, according to
an announcement by Pres. John S.
Nollen.

Donald L. Wilbur, PhD. has been
secured as an instructor in the de-

lege. has studied at Grenoble and
Penigia universi les, in Europe, and

cago, and Wisconsin, in the United
States. He has taught at North-
western and is a specialist in French
pronunciation.

Philip P. Chase, lecturer and in-
structor in American history, will be
the Harvard Exchange professor. He
will come during the second semes-
ter.

To Conduct Sports

Miss Bernice Cooper, ES, will
conduct Women’s sports and dancing
during the leave of absence of Miss
Clara J. Andersen, director of physi—
cal education for women, this year,
Miss Cooper is a graduate of the
University of Iowa, has taught in
private schools, camps, and the high
schools of Aurora, Ill.

Miss Toinette Swan, '13, has been

note of the Curry school of expres-
sion, in Boston where she graduated

rector of me Cornish little theatre,

from 1919 to lszs, and has since
served as director of the women's
dormitory at Morningside college.
She will replace Mrs. Cavann in Cote
tage III, who has become house
mother in Mears cottage.

Cross Country
Prospects Best
In Many Years

Never before in the history of
Grinnell has the possibility of a top-
notch cross country squad been so
imminent. Although Coach Elton A,
Rosen will have only two lettermen
back, his material is nevertheless of
such quality that the Pioneers should
go through the season with an un-
scarred record.

Myron Pilbrow, who was acclaimed
one of the nation’s leading twomilers
last spring, won three races last
year and eased up to allow Donald
Barber, the other returning letter-
man, to cinch his monogram in the
fourth race. Despite Filbrow's show-
ing, the rest of the squad was not
Wellrbalanced enough to win more
than one of the four meets.

This coming year should see im—
provement with the addition of Joe
Pfeiffer. one of the distance aces of
the 1932 track squad and an exper-
ienced road racer, and Thomas Gor-
sucb, freshman star. Pfeiffer had not
fulfilled the residence requirement
last year, and consequently was not
eligihle for fall sports. At one time
all {our members of this quartet
lived in Chicago, but Pilbrow recent-
ly moved to Rochester, N. Y.

Last year saw an innovation in
cross country racing in Missouri
Valley and Big Six circles. Instead
of routing the event across field and
stream, the races were run on a cin—
der track over a two-mile distance
with scoring recorded the same as
before,

Dickinson, Marker Head
Congregational Conference

Two Grinnelliaus, Arnold Dickin.
son and George Marker, both mem-
bers of the class of 1535, were at the
head of the joint session of the an-
nual Grinnell and Okoboji Congregae
tional conferences for young people
which was held here in June. Both
were elected president of their re»
spective conferences a year ago.

Pres, John s. Nollen conducted
a course in Bible study, and Nelson
W. Wehrhan, director of the person-
nel department was in charge of a
course in vocational guidance. In ad-
dition more than a dozen other mem-
bers of the college faculty spoke at
the various meetings.

The program included, besides
study courses, games and recreation
in the afternoons, and social events
in the evenings. The enrollment in-
cluded 250 picked young men and
women from over the state.

UPPERCLASS REGISTRATION

Upperclassmen will register with
their major professors, Thursday, ac-
cording to an announcement today by
Miss Bethana McCandless, registrar.
Students who have changed their ma-
jor subject, or whose record is not
with their major professor, are
asked to report to the office of the

 

registrar for instructions.

 

Dibble Hall to Keep Pottle Trophy;
Has Won Intramural Title 5 Times

Had Total Score of 1339.6;
Langlan Ranks Second,
Clark Third.

Dibble hall, several times winner
of the Pottle Trophy, traveling in-
tramural award, will keep the cup
for another year, as the result of
winning it again last spring. It has
been in her possession for six years—
since the year it was first awarded.

Inngan Second

Dibble finished first, second, or
third in every department, gamering
a total of 1335.6 points. Langan hall
was second with 1068.4 points, and
Clark hall third, with 10353 points.

The scores of the first three halls
remained close until after spring va.
cation. However, Dibble then clinch—
ed the cup by winning in tennis,
track, and baseball.

 

 

A resume of the intramural sports
for last year, and wmuers of the
first three places in each event, fol»

Speedball: Clark 150, Dibble 130,

Although Dibble managed to win
out by a safe margin last year, the
growing strength of the other build-
ings point toward a battle for the
trophy this year.

Nine Veterans

Will Probably
Start Game

Coach Watt to Experiment

on Best Working

Combinations

By MAX ROSS

At least nine of the 11 veterans on
the 1932 Grinneii college football
squad will be in the starting lineup
against Penn Friday night in the
opening game of the season. Coach
Watt has a larger number of men to
choose from this year than usual, and
it is likely that all lettermen, re-
serves, and sophomores will see ac-
tion for part of the contest,

Although the Pioneers have had
less than two weeks of practice, Tues-
day's scrimmage saw a backfield com-
posed of Graflund, James, Ullrich,
and Alexander slice through a yellow-
jerseyed defensive line for gain after
gain. Alexander and Ullrich frequent-
ly broke through to a clear field. The
workouts will taper off today and
Thursday before the game Friday
evening.

Lineups Indefinite

The starting lineups for both teams
are impossible to determine at this
early date, and both Coach Ed Wright
of Penn and Coach Lester Watt of
Grinnell will experiment to try to find
the most workable combination.

Grinnell will have Captain Fritz
Graﬂund, Moline, 111., at a fullback
position for a certainty. Unless pre-
season calculations go completely
amiss, Graflund will be one of the
outstanding backs in the Missouri
Valley conference this year. His
blocking and splendid work in book‘-
ing up the line have earned the right-
ful respect of his opponants.

Another backfield man who falls in
the same category with Grahund is
Dick Illlrich of Des Mcines, who is
playing his third year on the squad.
Illlrich has already astounded sport
critics with his spectacular punts in
practice drills, and is destined to be a
topnotch ball carrier as well.

James May Be Passer

A third man almost certain to be in
the starting lineup is Clarence (Snap)
James who may prove to be the man
coach Watt is looking for ass suc-
cessor to Hank Thomas. The fourth
member of the backfield quarter will
be picked from Harold Alexander,
Pioneer speedstcr. who has drawn the
attention of Grinnell followers with
his running in practice, victor Fini,
Colorado sophomore who will get a
try at the passing role, and Al Rose
who won his letter at a fullback post
last Season. Other backs are Clark,
Henningson, Krider, Singer, Bulmahn,
McKlveen, and Kingery.

The line presents a more difficult
problem as Line Coach Duke has ap-
proximately 25 men to choose from,
seven of these monogram winners. A
guess at the starting lineup would be
Duncan and McKee at the ends, Gould
and Lake at tackles, Figland, Martin,
or Rosenbloom at guards. and Bowlby
or McMillin at center. All are letter-
men except the last two mentioned.

Sophomores Promising

However, it will be difficult to keep
Bob Sutton, Bob Morgan, and Dick
Phelps out of the regular lineup. This
sophomore trio needs only experience
to develop into first string men.
Phelps is an end, Morgan a tackle, and
Sutton either a tackle or guard.

out of the group of candidates for
the forward wall, Bob McKee, How-
ard Gould, and Leroy Flgland seem to
