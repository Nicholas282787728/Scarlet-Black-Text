DES MOINES, 1a,, May ega
glance at the records of track and
field athletes representing Missouri
valley conference schools in the two
great mid»ll.'esl.ern relay carnivals,
Kansas and Drake, points to several
hotly contested races and the usual
share of record-breaking perform-
ances when these athletes gather
here in Drake stadium May 20 and
21, for the annual conference nub
door championships.

Paced by Ray Scars. Butler uni-
versity sophomore distance star, and
the Grinnell college four-mile relay
quartet. conference representatives
made a fine showing in the Drake
games. Sears, running his own race
for the first time in a great carni-
val, led a fine field most of the way
in the two-mile run, putting on a
strong finish to defeat Watson of
Indiana, the Big Ten indoor cham-
pion, handily. The time was 9:364,
as compared with the conference
mark of 9:37, set last year by “Iron
Mike" Pilbrow of Grinnell.

Pilhrow vs. Sears

Pilbrow ran anchor on the Grin-
nell fourrmlle team, and so could
not take part in the twoemile race.
The battle which he and Sears will
stage in the conference meet is ex-
pected to he one of the high-lights
of the event.

The Grinnell four-mile quartet was
hard pressed by Notre Dame. The
Irish grabbed the lead at the end of
the second mile as Pfeiffer tired in
the last lap, but Pilbrow steadily
closed the gap in the last mile as he
and his Notre Dame adversary raced
away from the challenge of Woolsie,
Big Ten indoor champion at the mile.

Glass Still Leads

A decided falling off in form since
his sophomore year has not pushed
Peyton Class, II, from his position
as the leading sprinter in the loop.
Glass ran anchor on the Oklahoma
Aggie sprint relay teams in both
meets and was responsible for the
places which the Aggies copped, He
will be pushed in the 100-yard dash,
however, by Frank Smith, the Drake
university star.

Valley athletes to date have not
shown exceptional speed in the mid—
dle distances, but Sears can turn the
trick. He may run in all three of
the longer races in the conference
meet. His remarkable performance
last year in the conference fresh-
man telegraphic meet, and the fact
that he has already been clocked in
nearmccord time in all three races
this season, indicate that he is the
outstanding performer in the loop in
these events. At Drake he ran a
half mile in the university two-mile
relay before winning the twoernile
grind, and he will almost certainly
be entered in two of the three events
in the conference meet,

Javelin Mark May Fall

In the field events, only one rec»
ord looks unsafe, and Carl Rigney,
Oklahoma Aggie javelin thrower,
will have to better his marks of the
Drake and Kansas games consider-
ably if he is to shatter the mark of
191 feet 10 inches established by
Cox of Oklahoma in 1923. Rigney
tossed the spear more than 184 feet
at Kansas, but at Drake he fell
back to a mark just over 121 feet.

Records in the broad jump, high
jump, shot put and discus throw
seem likely to withstand the attack
of the 1933 stars.

Hopes of wresting the team cham-
pionship from Oklahoma Aggies are
cherished in the Drake, Butler and
Grinnell camps,

Led by a strong sprint section and
with well balanced strength in the
middle distances and the field events,
the Aggies seem likely to retain
their team laurels, however, and are
almost certain to add another leg to
their possession of the Valley sprint
cup, the outstanding prize of the
meet. John Collins, Aggie miler, is
a real threat in the distances, Rig-
ney heads the Aggie field perform-
ers, and Peyton Glass is the leader
in the sprint section.

Drake's strength is built around
Smith, a sprinter; Webb and Gallag-
hcr, quarteremilers; and a balanced
strength in the field events. Crin-
nell will rely principally on Filbrow,
Pfeiffer and Gordon, distance stars
and Alexander, a sprinter, for their
points.

Ray'Sears leads the Butler squad,
which also has some capable weight
men. Washington’s strength is un-
certain, and Creighton will rely for
points chiefly on Bob Lanyon, a
hurdler,

Nebraska college editors have com—

muddy plow, oil can, ice wagon, or
squaw is a pet name for a co-cd. A

During “posture" week at Smith
college, girls went around the campus
wearing books on their heads.

One morning a week an economics

Freshmen at the University of

they are thrown into a lake,

Educational institutions in Texas
are likely to increase their tuition
fees for residents and double them
for non-residents, a new proposal in
that state proposes.

The library at the University of
Texas provides employment for 26
students. Applicants must have a
high scholastic record to do the work.

GRINl‘ELL, lO‘I'A, MAY.,

Pursuant to the provisions and intent of Senate File 433, Acts of the 45th G, A. of Iowa, I, the undersigned, a depositor
existing enerally and the marked

depreciation in the value of ieal estate, live stock, grain, and in all other property and commodities, and thereby recognizing
the consequent inability of borrowers of said bank to pay their notes to said bank under the prevailing economic conditions,

and further recognizing the great need for assisting in every reasonable way so that said bank and

its borrowers may

be given time in which to liquidate said loans in as orderly and Just a manner as possible, all of which it is believed will
thus inure to and will ultimately bring a greater cash benefit to the undersigned and to other depositors and to the community,
and desiring the continuity and maintenance of said bank, and in consideration of similar agreements signed or to be signed

by various other depositors, do hereby agree with said Bank, an d/or its successors and assigns,

reorganization of said ban 't being understood and agreed that 25 per cent of my said deposits shall be made
available and that I may receive the same in cash at said time. It is further agreed that as economic conditions
improve so as to enable the bank’s borrowers to pay their bank obligations, which payments will be pressed as
consistently and orderly as possible, and when the casli position of the bank therefrom makes it possible, the
directors of said bank, with the consent of the Department of Banking, shall make available a pro rata share of

I hereby assign and set over and authorize said bank officers to transfer the other 50 per cent of the above men-
tioned deposits to the Directors of said bank or to their successors or to such person or persons as the Superin-
