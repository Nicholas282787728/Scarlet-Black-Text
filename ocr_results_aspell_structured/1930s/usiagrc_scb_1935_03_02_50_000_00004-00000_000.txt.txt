The curtain was drawn on the 1935
Missouri Valley conference basketball
season last night wilh two teams
perched at the top of the percentage
column. Drake and Creighton. it is
a familiar position [or the Blueiays,
who have twice won undisputed titles,
and shared the championship on an.
other occasion. but for Drake it is a
brand new experience.

One conference argument remains
to he settled, when Tulsa stops at To.
peka tonight on is way home from
Omaha to do battle with the Wasl
bum quintet, but, (lie outcome of this
contest will have no bearing on the
standings other than to decide who
shall reside in the Valley cellar.

lnccntativcs Provided

With a previous defeat at the hand
of the Pioneers to spur the Bullodgs
on, and an unexpected deieat earlier
in the week to furnish the Jays with
incentive to wreak mayhem upon the
luckless Golden Hurricane from the
south, Drake trampled on Grinnell
last night to the tune of 47.26. while
Creighton breezed through with a 39.
21 win over N53.

The immediate result of thesc two
games, beside permitting the previous.
ly mentioned ascension of Drake and
Creighton to the conference throne,
was to place Crinnell in undisputed
third place in the Valley rankings, and
to push Tulsa a bit farther down into
the bottom of the percentage column.

Washington in Fourth

Washington, which finished its con.
lerenee schedule last week, is alone
in fourth place and the Oklahoma Ag.
gies. who finished their Valley cam.
paign with a 21.17 win over Tulsa
Wednesday night, is at present sole
possessor of the fifth position.

Drakc, Aggics Surprise

Drake and Oklahoma Aggies rank as
the surprise teams of the 1935 Valley
season, if any could be given this dis.
tinotion in a campaign so spotted with
upsets. But these two outfits, the
strongest oftensively and the strongest
defensively in Lhc conference, both
ended up with considerable better re.
cords than were predicted for them at
the first 01 the year.

The Bulldogs presented an offense
which all of its opponans found dif—
ficult to stifle, with the result that the
Des Moines co.ehampinns averaged
but but a fraction less than 39 points
per game. Only Grinnell, with an
average of a little more than 34 per
tilt, approached this record.

Cowboy Defense OllLstanding

The Aggies wore. perhaps, even
more outstanding with their display of
defensive strength, In spite of their
second division bcrlh, the Cowboys
allowed their Valley foes but sli ’llly
more then 24 counters each game.
Creighton iinished a comparatively
poor second in this respect. allowing
its loop opponans an avenge of 27
plus

Without a doubt, the most upeande
down team in the circuit was Washing.
