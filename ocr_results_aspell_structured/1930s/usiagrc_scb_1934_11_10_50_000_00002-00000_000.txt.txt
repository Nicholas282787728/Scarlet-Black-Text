LEST WE FORGET

Sixteen years ago tomorrow the “war to end
war" came to a close land millions of people in
a score of countries rejoiced, avowing to them-
selves that they would never be a party to such
a monstrous mistake again. Sixteen short years
ago—and yet already the memory of that horror,
of the wide-spread sorrow, even memory of the
immense cost in human life is fadin in the minds
of those who lived through the terrifying years of
the World War. And to the constantly-growing
number of indifferent souls must be added the
students and faculty of Grinnell college.

At least, observation of this memorable date
has become less and less a matter of concern on
the Grinnell campus .with passage of the years.
until—at lastithe day is to pass Without the least
effort to mark it as different from any of the other
30 days of November. No attempt will be made
to refreshen in the minds of Grinnellians the aw-
ful terror and pain and anxiety which was ever-
present during the two years that the United
States was engaged in the conﬂict.

Another such debacle must never again oc-
cur. To this all but a negligible few agree. The
best way, the most certain way to assure against
the repetition of this conflict is to keep the memo-
ry of the World War vividly alive in the memor-
ies of those who lived through it, and to impress
upon coming generations the immense cost of
such a conflict in money, men and human pain
and sorrow. If for no other reason than this,
the practice of observing Armistice Day should be
kept alive. If the poignant joy of that first Arm-
istice Day cannot be satisfactorily recaptured,
‘icn let Consideration of the immense burden of

nom'lc strife which has followed as a direct
, cvclopment of war he the order of the day.

November 11 should mean just as much to
Uncle Sam, to Grinnell, and to you as May 30,
Tuly 4, or the last Thursday in November; its
".ificance should not be ignored. So let us
. that some manner of Armistic Day observae
.1 will be again established at Grinncll. It

a real purpose to serve.

DISTANCE LENDS DIFFICULTY

To a number of students who live a consider»
able distance from Grinnell, the Thanksgiving va—
cation which is being granted again this year is
going to _ ve more tantalizing than satisfying.
The pmvi on that all afternoon classes must be
attended makes it impossible for all of the former
who have laboratories after lunch on Wednes-
day to reach their homes until late the following
day. Of course they have their choice between
a postponed Thanksgiving dinner or triple cuts for
absences;‘and the prospect is very good fora
bumper Crop of triple Cuts, as things stand.

It is entirely possible that this situation did
not occur to the committee in charge when they
drew up the plans for the Thanksgiving recess.
If so, we humbly call it to their attention so that
provision be made allowing students in this pos-
ition to take advantage of the holiday the same as
those living nearby.

It's too much to expect that more than a small
minority of the unfortunate ones in this predica-
ment will placidly attend class, thereby cutting
their stay at home short by nearly a full day—and
those triple cuts seem rather unfair punishment

folil the simple crime of living too for from Grin<
lie .

You’ve been very kind in restoring the
Thanksgiving vacation. Let’s make it possible
for everyone to enjoy the holiday.

G
PARTISANSHIP OUT OF PLACE,

”In order to preserve the principles of govern~
meilt we must have the cooperation of an intel-
ligcnt non-partisanship rather than the selfish-
partisanship which has grown up in presentrduy
politics," asserted William F. Riley, Des Moincs
attorney, last year in a discussion here on the sur—
vey of Iowa state and local government by the
Breaking: institute.

Perhaps Mr. Riley foresaw the absurd and

uncalled for mullsslinging which this very apt
and judicious report was to call forth during
the reccnt election. The Republicans, obviously
as a result of their rankling defeat in the last two
elections more than for any other reason, refused
to admit the least justification for such a reporti
censoring their opponents unmercifully for the
unnecessary expense thereby incurred, and scor-
ing its suggestions as undemocratic.

Not that the Republicans were alone in fool-
ish accusations against opponentsisuch have
been the invariable accompaniments of elections,
and apparently always will be—but in this par-
ticular matter the adverse arguments seem par-
ticularly baseless.

The proposals of the Brookings
pointed out by Mr. Riley were: reallocation of
functions and departments, which included per
sonnel duties, salary regulation and longer terms
of office: reorganization of the public school sys—
tem on the basis of a county unit plan; and new
revenues to reduce taxcs undcr a threespoint syr—
tem—namely, an individual income tax, a business
tax and a sales tax. Abolishmcnt of minor pol—
itical units, such as townships, was also suggest-
ed.

On the surface, these suggestions do not seem
dangerously radical; but the Republicans inferred
that the very foundations of democracy in the state
government would be undermined if the proposals
are carried out. This argumlcnt they based upon
the fact that many more offices would be ap
pointive, under the suggestion of the Brookings
survey, which are now elective.

What a thrill of pride and power the censcr’s
of the proposals must experience in electing the
county coroner, recorder, etc.!

The question is not whether the Brookings
proposals are soundithey obviously are; the real
question is whether or not there is a genuine need
for such changes in the governmental setsup in
Iowa,

Federal census figures for 1932 reveal that
only three of the 10 mid-western states, from
Ohio and Michigan on the cast to Nebraska and
Kansas on the west, expended more per Capitn
than Iowa in running their governments, although
Iowa is eighth in the matter of population.

Not only did Iowa rank fourth as to the most
expensive state government, but in regard to exs
pensive county government, Iowa leads the field.

One would certainlyhave to be blinded by
political jealously to ignore the implication of
these figures. AS Mr. Riley declared, non-par—
tisanship in regarding such proposals which con
com the welfare of all is of prime importance, It
will cost Mr. and Mrs. Iowa Taxpayer dearly if
the bigwigs persist in battling over matters which
should be the common interest of 311.

WHAT PRICE ELECTION?
(Iowa State Student)

One way to find out how much and what kind of
garbage has accumulated in your back yard is to take
off your hat. toss it into the political ring and then
stumpespeak for the ofﬁce of county sheriff or somea
thing, The immediate response will be remarkable. Your
opponent will promptly dig into your past history and
exhnme some of those prize winning vegetables, cabbagesi
dead cats and bits of litter which you will swear yo
never saw before. ,

That’s one nice thing about politics. It serves to
bring back those pleasant memories of gayer days, and
even if some of them can't possibly be recollections, at
least they will lend ’color to your careeriperhaps off.

and a wink are the fruits of denial. You see, a politie

Ask any voter.

Most poliucians aren’t elected because they are
better than their opponents. Usually the loser is just
worse and so there isn’t anything else to do.

It is unfair, of course, to hard all the campaigners
into a corral and brand them all as dishonest. There
was Abraham Lincoln, for examplkback in 1865, And
there are men just. like him today. Have you listened
to your radio? ,

But in this season of grandiloqnent promises, pant-
ing lungs and waving hands, we,can’t help but wonder
while the fellows with the high hats sling the mud, duck,
scoop up another handful, throw, and duck again, if
there aren't some things about a democratic government
which we must just. grin and. bear. After all, our
government seems to be the least painful of any in
existence; so perhaps we shouldn't mumble about its
evils. Alter all, the politician is an interesting creature,
born, like Baron Munohausen, with a natural gift for
Eloquence; bom, like Napoleon. with a natural desire
to do the people good—and for all they‘re worth.

We in college look forward eagerly to the day when
some portly gentleman, beaming personality from a to.
inch waistline swaggers up to us, shoves a pretty little
card in our hand while he mangles the other, proffers a
secent cigar with a zs—ccnt; wrapper and mumbles, “Well,
the other guy is worse than I am."

experience. He will ever be gathering knowledge, ac—

renders his independence or loses his divine curiosity, he
has forsaken culturejand become, according to his type,
either a catalogue or‘a codFin either case, a hindrance
and a bore. ‘ .

Grinding on 9-Inch

Telescope Lens

Occupies Abe Singer’s Spare Time

Construction of Instrument

Serves as Student's
SRE Work

It would be a bad lab for anyone
inclined to the "jitters"—uiis job of
Abe Singer’s. To grind . . . and grind
. and grind, and from day to day
salmost from week to weekisee no
progress whatever is hardly the task
for a nervous man.

Making a telescopkfor this is what
is back of all the aforementioned
grinding—is undeniably tedious buss
iness; but as the reporter approached
Singer, who was hunched over the
top of a barrel carefully rubbing
one piece of glass against a film of
emery dust which covered the
surface of a second piece, he seemed
to be thoroughly enjoying the pro.
cedure.

Hour and IIall a Day

For an hour, and a half a day, six
days a week Singer has been at work
on a nine-inch telescope lens ever
since the opening of the school year.

“Actually, I am not able to work
more than 45 minutes out ol the hour
and a half," the worker admitted,
qualifying the preceding statement.
“The work of getting ready to grind,
and obtaining the necessary materials
together takes at least half of the
time And I must carefully wash the
lens both before and after grinding.”
The slightest bit of dust might scratch
the ions, he said, putting the entire
construction back a month or so.

The present one is the second tele.
scope which Singer has built this year;
last summer he constructed a small,
six»lnch instrument for his own use,
Through this apeiience he gained
much of his present knowledge con.
cerning the difficulties connected with
the delicate task of grinding lenses.

Knowledge me Magazines

“Most of the technical knowledge
that I used in constructing my tele
scope this summer l gained from mags
azine articles on the subject of ‘astron.
erny," he explained “I found much

CHAPEL
NOTES

An analysis of literature was the
subject of the four chapel talks given
this week by Eleanor Lowden, profes-
sor of English.

In discussing the inspirations of the
Poet, Miss Lowderi declared that the
poet is one “who sees the world afresh
as if it were indeed the first day of
creation so that his account makes
us see for the first time things whi ' '
we have passed" .

In the second talk on Tuesday Miss
Imwden emphasized the fact that Bible
is excellent literature and as a result
has a great hold upon the minds‘ of
men. “The Bible,” she stated, “is fill.
ed with stories, dramas and poems
that were the works of men who had
the divine gift of seeing the peculiar
significance of men's experiences.”

“Creative books are not to be
thought of as a jewel -Invenued as a
substitutes for sermons, systems of
philosophy nor social documents."
Books that have been so used have
only had transitory value, instead of
permanent value, the speaker explain-
ed in the third talk on Wednesday.
The Browning clubs of the last cen.
tury are illustrative of this, she point»
ed out,

“Great writers are of use to us . I'
their discernment of fundamental
truths,” Miss Lowden asserted in be-
ginning ,her final talk Thursday. A
frequent criticism of modern writers
is their obsession with a desire to
present only the drab and sordid side
of life. Sinclair Lewis is particularly
open to this criticism, she pointed out

of my information in the Scientific
American and Popular Astronomy. I
also found a book on the subject, but
to late to help me last summer."

“I broke one lens while grinding it
last summer," "and all I could do was
start over." he recalled with a grim—
ace.

Reporter His Undoing

"My most provoking experience,
however, occurred when a reporter
from my honte.wwn daily newspaper
inteiviewed me in regard to the six-
inch telescope which I had just com-
pleted. Everything was adjusted
when the rcporttar arrived for the in.
terview. Inspite of my warnings he
insisted upon looking through the
telescope and in so doing'disarranged
the delicate adjustrnean which I had
just succeeded in making. By merely
turning two of the thumbscrcws he
ruined some 21) hours of hard work on
my part, and since then 1 have had no
great love for reporters,” he declared.

2,025 Times More Light

The telescope now under construe.
tion will be able to gather 2,025 times
more light than the human eye. This
great increase in ability to pick up
light will cause many smrs to be vis-
ible which could not before be seen
with the naked eye.

The human eye according to singer,
can see approximately only 20005tars.
