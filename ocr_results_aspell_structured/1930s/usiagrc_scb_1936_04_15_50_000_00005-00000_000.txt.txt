Legionnail‘es. Issue Book
on Freedom of Speech

New York City7(ACP)7Flatly
advocating freedom of speech and
the search of truth. the New York
county American Legion last week
issued a hook that is designed as
a guide for all Legion speakers and
called a halt on all attempts to
“abuse or silence" those who difr
for with them on government
forms of policies.

But the hook does warn its read
crs that dictatorship by “a person
or by any special group” would
mean “the intolerant suppression
by an armed force of democracy,
Justice and liberty.”

“Never was it more necessary
than now for all Americans to sup
port their right to freedom of
speech and freedom to listen and
learn,” the booklet says. "We live
in a period of bewildering changes.
some nations have shifted convul»
sivcly from one form of ,governr
ment to another overnight; others
waver between various forms.
