Gridders Out

for Practice

Veteran Players Report

to Watt Today

Outdoor spring foothall practice
started today under the direction of
Coach L. L, (Fuzz) Wott with nearly
30 inch reporting for uniforms. The
spring- football Squad will include all
veterans and men interested in the
grid sport who are not out for some
varsity competition this spring.

CapLain Fritz Graflunrl will not be
available since he is tossing the payee
lin with the track squad and A! Rose
is another backfield veteran who will
he missed. He tosses the shot. Mc-
Kee and Lake are also counted with
the tracknien.

Roseiihlooni in Shape

The mentor will have a strong
nucleus for his spring drills, however,
centering around the seven letter-
men who will report. Rosenbloom,
Figland, and Martin are on hand to
uphold the guard assignments.

Rosenhloam injured his knee in the
final game of the season last fall,
but is in shape for plenty of compe-
tition now, and Figland has recovered
from the leg injury which bothered
him during the 1.931 season.

’l‘wo Veteran Backs

Gould and Canavan are veterans at
the tackle herths while coach Watt
will have one experienced end on hand
in Duncan. Lake, another tackle, is
on the track sipiad.

With Craflund and Rose out, the
mentor will have only two veteran
hacks, Ullrich and James. The latter
saw little action in 1531 hecause of
an injured leg, and Which was out
of the last three games with a had
foot, but both are now in shape for
heavy competition.

one of the big jobs facing Coach
Watt is the replacing of Oscar
Christotterscn at the center position.
Bud st, John, reserve of last season,
although light, will probably get
plenty of chance at the post during
the spring workouts, while Bob Mc-
Millin, stalwart of the freshman line
last fall, will have a chance to show
his paces.

Watt Watches Baal-u

While freshmen are expected to
give the experienced men plenty of
competition in the line, with Sutton,
Meeter, Morgan, and Durham favor-
ed, the big workout for the yearlings
will he in the backfield, where the
mentor is in the market for a suc-
cessor to Hank Thomas,

Fini, Hayden, Smelser, Crews, and
Kr—ider are scheduled to get plenty of
work on blocking and ball carrying
in the next week to prepare them for
active work next fall.

Coach Watt has already sent his
men thm fundamentals in their indoor
spring drill before the spring recess.
