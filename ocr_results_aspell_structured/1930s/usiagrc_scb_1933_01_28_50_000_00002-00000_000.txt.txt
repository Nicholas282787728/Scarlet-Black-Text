THE ANNUAL QUESTION OF SENIOR. EXAMS

Every year about this time the students bring

up the question of eliminating the final senior cxe
animations ill the spring, and with the same regu-
lal'it_ the faculty decides to continue them.
' student’s argument is that senior grades
are already turned ill at the registrar’s office at
the time of the second semester finals and the out-
come of the e. amiuution would make no difference
in the vast majority of cases. The faculty answer
is that these examinations are primal-'ly For those
students just on the borderline of pa 11g and faile
ing‘ and that the examination will detey'millc
whether or not they receive their degree.

Why not a compromise? Why would it not he
possible to exempt the A and B and eVCll possibly
C students from these final examinations. compellr
lug only the D students to take them, since they
are the ones effected. Snielv that time of the school

BIG TALK ,

A recent exchange editorial ”False Patriot-
isln,’ taken from The Daily Northwestern, mid
published in The Scarlet and Blue Jail. 4. has
drawn ”colliniolit” from Funk R iles. militant
editor of the Iowa chiouair

The expression uliich appears to have partic-
ularly irked Ml. Miles is “sort of elaptrap which
floats folth on the beery health of ovary American
Legion convention”

Quoting [10111 Miles’ editorial in the Legiollnirc
of J 2 :

' “Such a statement is either imbecile ignor-
ance or vipel - viciousncss, a cowardly, cone
telnptihle lie in either event, which shows the
author to be about as qualified for his position as
a traitor is for the Medal of Honor.”

Strong words those! However, so far. we’ve
noted that big words, in strong statements, mean
nothing—unless the user puts forth proof to Sub-
Salitiate these statements!

Editor Milcs does not stop there. He continues:

”Arthur N. Hough is managing cditor of

The Scarlet and Black, The reprint was used not
in the fomm section but as one of his major
editorials ill his Jail. 4 issue, so We mist tinder-
stand that he wanted it to be taken as the opinion
of himself and of those who Sponsor the publicae
tion. We do not know who is editor of the Daily
Northwestern, and we do ilot care."

For the edification of Mr, Miles and our other
readers, we wish to say that exchange editorials,
reprinted iii The Scarlet and Black, are ncvcr
meant to necessarily reflect. the opinions of tile
editor, or the cditoticl boar . In fact, in order that
such editorials will not be mistaken for our own,
the latter are printed in the larger, 107point type,
while the editorials of other papers r 'c printed
ill the smaller, Sepoint type, with a credit line at the
top. This was done in the case of the editorial in
question.

The purpose of our exchange material used is
to show Scarlet and Black readers what students
of other schools are doing and thinking. With some
of these exchange opinions, we agree—with others
we do not.

Be that as it may—our own opinions are set
forth in our own editorials.

But that wasn‘t all Mr.
cluded:

“But We are not insnltcd; we ilever are by
rapping puppies”

Well we’re not insulted. either, Mr. Miles;
never are by lllustering bigots.

EDUCATION GOES RIGHT ON
(From Davenport Democrat)

While existing economic conditions may compel the
lightening of purse strings in many directions, it is
gratifying to know that paients are not neglecting the
educations of their children by reason of their reduced
budgets.

It undoubtedly will be surprising to many to learn
that there are more boys in college today, than there
were during the prosperous days of 1027. That fact is
brought out by Dr. Raymond Walters, president of the
University of Cincinnati, who has just completed a sui»
vey of college enrollment in the United States. It is
true, however, that the increase noted from 1927 to
1931, amounting to something like 7 p’er cent, had dis-
apesred in 1932, but the present day enrollment 1e-
inains in excess of that of the former year.

The survey embraces enrollment statistics of 435
approved colleges and universities, and therefore covers
the entire country. In these schools there are 1355,1203
boys and girls, of which 548,169 are full time students.
In his survey Dr, Walters found that more and more
students are turning away from specialized training.
Liberal arts selections dominate American colleges
more than ever. 0f the professional course‘s, his figures
for the larger schools showed teaching still preferred,
Next in order came engineering, commerce, law and
medicine.

The five schools with the greatest fullrtlme enroll-
ment are given in their order as follows: University of
California, Columbia University, New York University,
Minnesota and Illinois. The State University of Iowa,
with 7,115, stands 25th in total enrollments.

It 1s undoubtedly true that thc deprcssion has had
a twofold effect on education. In the first place it
has brought more people to a serious realization of the
value of education. With less‘ employment to be had.
they have more time for study. an the other hand is
distressing situation comes from the difficulty of many
to continue their higher education by reason of lack of
funds.

According to Dr. Walters report, however, it seems
that the majority of the latter class are finding a way
out of their embarrassment. For after all, most people
stand firm in their conviction that there is no better
1nvestment than that of money spent in education.
That applies alike to depression periods as well as to
more prosperous times.

THE “GRIPE” BOGY
(Donne Owl)

Wake up! Outside the sun is shining. You are alive,
not dead, though appearances may dispute it. And don't
drop back into that stupor again, and fall to the pas-
time of the inoccupied mind, the sedative of the men-
tally and morally lazyi“gripe”, “gripe", “gripe”.

From some place, no one seems to know Where, an
invi hie-like poisonous gas, this discontent has creeped
into our consciousness, and has numbed our sensibilities
and reasoning. Where has it come from? Why is it?
What is it7 Perhaps it deserves analysis,

Who is as desolate as the individual without a pure
pose in life? who is as easily discouraged, who is as
discontented, who is as disappointed with his present
condition as the individual whose life points to no more
than living through another day? Not inst the purpose
must be an exalted one—it may be no more than an
joying life, oriweli, here we shall say, “heck-raising".
The purpose of ones life may lie in the apparent pur-
poselessness of it. one may be satisfied whatever hap-
pens, may be genuinely indifferent, but he has an aim
in life~it is complete freedom from any and all effort,
physical or mental. If he gains his end, he is contented.

If we reconcile the ”purpose" theory with this dis»
content, it seems to us that this “gripe" is nothing more
than “lethargy” behind a mask. Again, we do not mean
that a “purpose in hm" infers a dynamic bustle of so
tiv1ty. People are constructed differentlyisome have
high aspirations others are constitutionally contented.
But the disguismg ones, the perpetual “gripers”, the
ones to whom this epistle is directed, have hidden in
their breasts some dormant, abstract ambition or desire,
but are too lazy, too "dead" to follow any path to any
goal. And, surrounded by like creatures, almost over-
whelmed by a touching self-pity, they despair their un-
happy lot, while outside a world of activity moves ou~
a world of life and energy. But locked in their rooms,
closed to the world and real life, they "gripe”. To hear
them wail, one would think that the globe had ceased
rotating on its axis.

“Things are so dea " they cry. "This place is dead.
There is nothing to do Tommyrotl Open your eyes.

UNFAIB. CRITICISM
(Oberlin Review)

A criticism often made of colleges charges that the
necessity of concentmtion in many definite fields al—
lows the student very little time to do profitable reading
and research on those topics he likes best. Since the
chance to more completely link and extend work in the
various studies Is hampered by rather strict assign-
meats, it is held that college training consists merely
of a dab on this and that canvas, instead of a thorn
application to a few important jobs. The result of this
belief, then, is complete disapproval of all college regu—
lations in regard to lines of study.

Although numerous studies (orientation courses, for
example) propose not at all to cover thoroughly their
field, they do attempt to stimulate student interest in
that field. Courses such as these have decidedly valuable
result: graduates tend to continue and to enlarge their
reading when they find the spare time. Perhaps it is
this outcome that causes some alumni to assert that
the chief value of colleges is to he found In the offering

Psycholagist Says Success
Depends on Personality

WICHITA, Kari. (CNSt e Maybe
111a beautiful but dumb girls have
something after all:

According to obseivations made by
Prof. H. w. Mike-sell, head of the
psychology department at the our
versity of Wichita, girls with pet»
sanality, rather than brains, are most
likely to succeed.

“Psychology has determined by
actual experiment that success de-
pends 85 per cent upon personality
and only 15 per cent on brains," he
said.

He or ized the tendency of col-
1sges to “place high emphasis upon
intelligence and little stress upon
personality,"
