DEBUNKENG HISTORLES

4 Methodist ministers Monday in a meoting
in Des Moincs declared} “histories should be
debunked in the interest of truth and heroes
should bc of peace instead of war.“

Thc ministry further declared that this na~
tion should stand ready to invoke the Paris
peace pact and help to mobilize world senti-
ment, against threatened war; that the United
States cooperate fully with the League of Na-
tions and that all profit be removed from war
and the preparation for war,

With the last statcmonts we agree in part
at least lmt with the first, that histories should
be debunked, we wish to take issue. It is ollr
belief that good, first class histories accentuate
peace heroes fully as much or more than they
do war heroes. However, it is not possible to
totally ignore wars and those who led them.
They are historical facts and must be dealt
with ill any true history. However, any really
good history makes no effort to singthe praises
of war leaders, but deals with them in an ob-
jective, abstract manner.

If anything, a good history will tend to de-
bunk war leaders rather than make them llc~
rues. Any true historian goes back of the more
outer happenings into an analyzation of the
motives and driving forces hack of them. in
so doing they more, often than not tear down
rather than build up warriors as heroes.

Further, historians with any degree of per-
spective to their writings, place more emphasis
on the deeds of great men in peace than in war.
For example, Napoleon, although rcmembcrcd
as a great warrior, will remain in the minds of
the people for longer for the internal reforms
which he brought about. it is for this rather
than for his military exploits, that the histor-
ian honors him. '

Tllc ministers would have (‘Dme far nearer
touching on the true center of the problem if
they had urged that all schools adopt good.
well-written histories. thus killing thc market
for any histories of the other type that m'ght

be published.

OXFORD AND SOCIAL RELIGION

From out of staid Oxford, dignified in its
academic robes, comes a religious movement
which promises to become a renaissance in
Christianity. ‘

It is collcdl the Oxford Group movement;
sometimes, Ruchmanism. People come together
ill "house parties”. They confide to each
other their “sins” and suppressions. In dis-
cu. ion they sharc their spiritual travails and
triumphs.

“What is most important in the Group is
(hr. emphas s upon social expression, HPrayer”
and “communion witll God” are not ends ill
themselves, but are foundations for social
action. Chrl tianity is a way of life, a way of
bu he 91 politics and social relations. Chris
tianlty is not a way of living within yourself,

of feeling noble sentiments and thinking beau-
tiful thoughts. ‘

From Norway to Argentine, from Scotland
to Japan, the Oxford Group idea has found
thousands of converts. It has become 21 vital
part of the lives of churchgoers and sceptics
alike, of conservatives and hardboiled radicals,
of white-collared men and coal miners.

Although the Oxford Group clings to such
old fashioned terminology as ‘sin” and “Holy
Spirit”, it seems to be well grounded in the
principles of mental hygicnc.

\Vllcther or not we think this is just
another religious fad, it deserves our serious
study and consideration. Certainly, Chris-
tianity could become more dynamic and sigllif
cant in the lives of men. Perhaps the Oxford
Group movement will (lo the job. M.

WHY GO TO COLLEGE?

(Cnc Collego Coslllos)

:\ cullego provides all intellectual and
social cllvironmellt in which young people mul-
(Lt-over and develop both mental and SDI'ial
ablhti s or qualities of great valuc to them-
selves and society for the rcst of their live

These values may include gl-catcl' busluc,
and professional success, thus adding to one
economic security, or they may include thc.
ts, broader
lmowledgc, friendship, and a better under-
standing of the world and affairs, College
should develop character and personality fully
as much as professional competence and mental
ability

This experience will require time and
money during a period in which the individual
is usually for from self-supporting, Moreover,
the results will vary with the ability, the initinr
live, and the determination of each individual
to got the most of the experience. The more of
these qualities that one brings to college, thc
more one gets out of college.

Unfortunately, the collcge cannot supply
these qualities which are necessary to suppch
merit the time and money spent on a college
education, if the result is to prove profitable.
Occasionally the college environment will help
the individual to develop some of these quali-
tics it' lhoy,al'e lacking, but not always by ally
means. ,

From the preceding statements it is
obvious that not everyone should go to college,
and the decision for or against must rest
largely on a serious personal examination and
appraisal of the student ’s qualifications to
profit by a college education. Olle‘s economic
rcsources must be canvassed as well as one’s
mental capacity and especially one’s interest
in a professional and intellectual career,

A college is a place for students who may
later, through the development of intellectual
curiosity, become scholars in their own right.
In brief, a college is a place where high school
boys and girls with a reasonable degree of
intellectual ability, ambition, and determina~
tion to make the most of their opportunities
may develop ill tllc space of four years into
straight-thinking men and women, ready to
undertake professional, social, and economic
responsibilities on the highcr and broader scale
than would othcrwise be possible.

The college provides the environment, the
faculty, and the facilities for such development
for those who have the ability to profit by such
an experience.

Monday

An sos call is being broadcast
in our classrooms by bewildered
freshmen, John :1 Ryan, professor
of public speaking, Said in chapel
Monday. He offered a formula to
aid the distressed students uslng
the words starting, opportunity.
self.

“Start your college as you start
your cur~in law," Mr. Ryan ad-
vised. “The men who fail are those
who start in high, because they
build success on imagination, not
achievement."

College may be defined as an
opportunity to study, he sold, Mr.
Ryan quoted three poems on the
theme of opportunity. rejecting
the one which spoke of it knock-
ing but once and the one which
says it comes every day. He
agreed with the poet Sill's lines
stating that. opportunity comes
from within the indiVlduaI.

Illustrating self, Mr. Ryan told
of a man in a dream who saw
three prophets. Socrates came to
him saying, “Know thyself," and
vanished, Marcus Aurelius said,
“Control thyself," and disappeared.
But Christ came shying, “Deny
thyself; follow me," and this
vision did not puss sway.

Tuesday

A tmly liberal course with no
fees, no required attendance, and
no credit was the description giv-
on at the daily chapel service by
William J. Rusk, professor of
mathematics, Tuesday. Most of the
regular courses. particularly those
known as pre~luw pre-medic, or
pro-engineering, he pals. place
emphasis on the material- content
of the course rather than on the
liberal education m be derived
from them.

Mr. Rusk quoted an old Oxford
don's definition of a liberal edu-
cation as “what is left after every-
thing learned at college has been
forgotten," and added, “except
how to think!”

The true test of a man with a
liberal education, he stated, is his
attitude toward crises he has
never met before,

“You have an opportunity to
gain the equal 01' 16 hours of ex-
tra credit by attending chapel
every day." he concluded. "it is up
to you whether you take advan-
tage of it."

at the Post Office and one at the
college," he explained.

Students living in town are re-
quested to have their mail all-
dressed to them in care of the
residence at which they are living.

mail, Mr. Nelson stated.
