Pioneers Polish

Oiffense for Tilt
with lCoe Friday

(By Wells Burnett)

Picking up their work after a
week's rest, the Pioneer varsity
football squad Monday started
polishing their offense in prepara-
tion for their game with coe
college at Cedar Rapids Friday
afternoon. Coach Guy Lookar
baugh plans to do enough work
this week to keep the men in
good physical condition, but little
enough to keep from staleness.

As a consequence, most of the
time will he spent in polishing
plays and working on the rough
spots which showed up in the
Homecoming game With Drake
last week. Monday night’s ses-
sion was devoted to the passing
game, while most of Tuesday's
practice period was given over
to work on kicking,

Moore to start

The starting lineup for Friday's
game will be substantially the
same as it was against Drake.
with the single exception of Wit-
trock. Moore, who failed to start
in the Homecoming game because
of a back injury, has had suf—
ficient time to recover, Looka—
baiigh believes, and will take his
old place while wittrock recov~
eis from an ankle injury received
last week. Bill Sampson, who
also injured his ankle in the Drake
game, will be in good shape to
start.

Barker cut

Harry Barker, out for the last
two and a half weeks with a
knee injury, has been taking short
workouts, but will not play
against (Joe.

The rest of the lineup will con-
sist of Boiler at left end, Graves
or Osborne at left tackle, Wood—
ward at left guard, captain Fow-
ler at center, High at right
guard, Hayward at right end, and
Evans, sehlctterbeck, and Snow
in the backfield. Scotty McLeod,
who suffered a recurrence of his
old knee injury last week is
definitely out for the rest of the
season. .

Coc Well-Balanced

coe, according to the Pioneer
scouts, has a well-balanced, ver-
satile attack this year, ,which is,
however, not so strong as some
the Pioneers have met. The Ko-
hawks have had a fair season,
defeating Cornell by a one score
and winning several conference
games. However they have been
defeated by Iowa state Teachers

Although Coe will be pointing
for Grinnell, inasmuch as the
igdme Will be the Kohawks‘ last
this year and is on their home
field, the Pioneers will be out for
blood after losing last year’s
game by a 33-0 score.

Russell Sage College
Graduates M usl Talk
Themselves Out

Troy, N. Y. (ACP) _ If you
want to graduate from Russell
Sage college, you now have to talk
yourself out.

This year, for the first time, all
freshmen are required to enroll in
speech courses. Each pupil rc-
ceives a first-hand opportunity to
“hear herself as others hear her,"
for phonograph records are made
of her voice to help her in diagnos-
ing her own speech weaknesses.

The course follows four graduat-
ed steps 7 diagnosis, demonstra-
tion, practice, and performance,
Practice is left largely to the indi-
vidual student and is a regular part
of her outside preparation work
for the course. Progress or lack
of progress is demonstrated in
class-room performances. For the
sake of comparison, each student
again will record her voice at the
end of the course.

Onevact plays, debating, and
similar activities keep emphasis on
speech as one of the main objece
tives. Upper classmen are not
required to enroll, but the poor
freshmen have no choice; they
can't even talk themselves out/ of
taking the course.

ENJOY

Students, Learn Technique
of Making Puppets,
Marionette:

If you were given a piece ofl
string, some scraps of cloth and
paper, and a little bit of clay, and
told to make something with that
material, What would you do? If
you were ill Mrs. Elizabeth Hens-
ley's applied arts class you would
probably start in immediately to
make a puppet or a toy of some
sort. ,

Little Black Samba and the ti~
gers, and Raggedy Ann and Andy.
are among the puppets which the
advanced craft class have made
- this fall, These are fist puppets and'
are Worked by putting the doll’s
head and arms over the person's
fingers and moving them. Later,
marionettes which are Worked by
strings will be dEVeloped. At pres~
ent the group is building a stagel
and rehearsing the puppets.

Later in the year the class Willi
learn leather tooling, metal work,
and tierdyeing', along with other
crafts. Members of the class are
Gladys Eider, Mary Garner, and
Virginia Cole.

Indian bowls, pink elephants,
sleeping mice, and other articles
have been made of clay, baked in
a gas oven. and then painted by
the members of the elementary
class. Soap and wood carving,
weaving, and finger painting will
be projects taken up later. A toy
