said Barbara Wethel'ell,Y Beard
director of the Grinnell welfare
center recently. i

in helping underprivileged chil—
dren at the center to work and
play together cooperatively, col-
lege students are getting a real
ltaste of social welfare work, she
, explained. A fresh-end vital inter-
‘cst in the project has developed
this year, with about so men and
women devoting part of their time
to guidance activities at the club.

Between 75 and 100 of Grinnell's
underprivileged children flock to
the club house regularly, many
coming in the winter to escape
the cold of poorly heated homes.
student workers are ottcn faced
with special prohlems in helping
those who are mentally deficient
or have speech defects to adjust to
the others of their group.

To teach children to use their
lhands skillfully, welfare workers
, will direct them in handling paper,
i wood, and leather in weekly craft
projects this year. in addition,
students are working out a pro-
gram to acquaint young club mem-
hers with foreign countries, games,
dances, and songs at after-school
sessions from 3:30 to 5.

In Order to coach the boys in
volleyball and basketball, college
men have asked the Grinnell
school board for permission to use
the gym in one of the grammar
schools twice a week. They are
also making tentative plans to
turn the college swimming pool
over to the childrtn every \Ved-
ncsday night.

Cooperating with the college
workers, the Grinnell city council
has provided the cluh with flood-
lights so that the children may
play outdoors at night as long as
weather permits, Under- the direc-
tion of Charles Harpole, Rail/son
junior, students are setting up
haskethall hackhoards, also part of
the new equipment furnished by
the council. .

of the college girls who work
regularly at uncle Sam's, ten have
been chosen as chairmen of the
daily groups. They are Gene Jer-
ald, James sophomore; Lois Scott,
Loose hall sophomore; Betty c. -
man, Loose hall junior; Patricia
Hansen, Read junior; Beverly
