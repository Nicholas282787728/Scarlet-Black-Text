Harriers

: In the Long Run.

by Justin Lincoln

Alter successful meets and recuperation
during Fall Break. the Pioneer Cross
Country squads depart for Chicago today
with the hopes of returning with con:
ference laurels.

Both teams ran at the Coe Invitational
on October 18. where the men captured the
title with 29 points and the women were se-
cond with 69 behind non-conference Simpr
son's 22

The men were led by Greg Evans, the
men's individual champion who finished
the five-mile course In 25:12. a personal
best Dave Wisdom ﬁnished 4th with 26:56,
while Ivan LorkoviC, Phil Lefebvre. Kent
Koth, Steve Piper. Steve Harrnld, and
Jonathan Lave packed into the 7th through
12th positions. These eight men will repre»
sent Grinnell in Chicago.

Coach Will Freeman said, “It was a good
run considering the week before the meet
was midterm week as well as our toughest
week of training of the season.”

In the women's race. Shavaun Adams
finished 1st for Grinnell and 2nd overall in
18:42 on the three-mile course, followed by
Jennifer Bishop at 5th in 19:11. Mary
Lanaghan was No. 3 for the Pioneers,
finishing 19th in 21:13. Rounding out the
scoring were Ashley Abel, zist. Mary Lea
Crawley, 22nd. Ingrid Hutter, 23rd, and
Marianne Carlson, 24th. Dorothy Shearn.
Blair Davison. and Heather Lauver, three
of Grinnell's top five. did not run. _

“I was impressed by a number of our
runners " said Coach Evelyn Freeman,

Winning

“Shavaun ran a very aggressive race, and
Ashley Abel had her best race of the
season "

Tomorrow, the women will be defending
the title they won last year by edging out
St, Norbert. and Freeman expects the
Green Knights to provide the toughest
competition again this year.

“I expect well either finish first or se-
cond,” said Freeman. The top three
women on the team sport some of the best
times in the conference, and Freeman said

the iinal team standing ”will depend on
how well our No. 4 and 5 runners finish."
The designated eight for’ the meet are
seniors Bishop, Adams. Carlson.
Hutter,and Lanaghan. juniors Sliearn and
Beth Powers and sophomore Davisnn.

The men's squad. which hasn't taken the
conlerence title in 26 years. is favored to
win this year’s meet. The team is going in
to the race undefeated against league op-
ponents, and everyone is healthy. but
Freeman reamins cautious in his op-
timism, saying. “I‘ve seen other teams
have great seasons and then sulier a let
down at the conference meet, so anything
is pOSSible,” He expects strong competi»
tion from Knox. Cornell, and U. of
Chicago.

The meet will be run at Washington Park
in Chicago, the same site at which Grinnell
last captured the men's conference cham-
pionship in 1960. A reunion of sorts Wlll be.
held there, as five members of that cham~
pionship squad will be present at the race.

partly was a result of not getting seeded
because of an erratic season."

Holiday from page 4

cot “and you shall rejoice in your
festival." The holiday coincides with the
nnal harvest of the year where people are
naturally more grateful and thankful to
the Lord.

Decorating the sukkah with colorful fruit
and designs, eating family meals inside
the sukkah, as well as singing and dancing
at religious celebrations are all traditions
lor "rejoicing" during this holiday.

Following the seven days of Succot is
“Shmini Atzeret." a oneeday festival
which concludes Succot. This holiday is
also a “season of rejoicing." according to
the prayer book, On this day. one leaves
the succah and returns to one's permanent
dwelling.

The day Is also known as "Simchat
Torah." Rejoming of the Torah. as it
marks the end of the annual torah reading
and the starting over of reading the torah
for the coming year. This is celebrated by
marching with all torah scrolls seven
times around the snyagogue. waving ﬂags,
and by much singing and dancing.

be a step above the average lunch at Quad
or Cowles.

We don't spend ALL of our time at St.
Matthews. Most of the profs at GIL also
see it as a Way Out. and INSIST that

students spend as much time as possible
actually IN London. A homework assign
ment of two or three hours a week in some
of the world's most renowned art galleries
may seem a bit harsh. but we try to take it
in stride. ,

GIL profs will take any opportunity for a
Field Trip. Mr. Lee's Humanities class has
been reading Rudyard Kipling and study-
ing the British Empire in India, so of
course we HAD to go see Kipling’s country
house. and the Chinese- and Indian-style
Royal Pavilion in Brighton. Being the nice
people that we are. we invited everyone
else along. Well, sure the weather was
gorgeous, the scenery enchanting. the ex-
tra hour We had to Spend on the beach
afterwards delightful. and the whole trip
paid for: but it was really the chance to
learn something about the Empire
tirsthand that lured everyone along. right?

Classes? Papers? Tests? Don't we Ever
do any Work? Well, yes. those inescapable
elements of the Grinnell Experience haunt
the lives of Grinnell-ineLondoners. too. We
have late nights, cram sessions. and
moments of aeadmemic panic, just like
any other Grinnellians. Thanks to Mr.
Caulkins and his Tandy loos this year we
can even have computer problems as well.
So it‘s really just like being home in Grinv
nell . . . . except that it's on the other side of
the Way Out.
