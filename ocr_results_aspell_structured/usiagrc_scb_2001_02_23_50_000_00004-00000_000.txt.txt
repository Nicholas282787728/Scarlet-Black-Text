Although discussion about swcauhop labor domi»
nated last Friday's open forum between students and
the Board ofTrustees, studenm also raised concernsabout
the direction oicani pus planning and the college’s rela.
tionship with the city otctinnell.

Two questions about the Board otTrustees' stiue»
ture came up early. one student asked the trustee panel,
which contained one African American and two women,
whether eltorts were underway to diversity the board.
in terms ormce, clues and profession (“spit it out! We're
all lawyers," Intetiected Fied Little '53.)

“lryou look at the board today and compare it to
what it was rite years ago, there's a much greater divcp
sity," responded Bob Britt '57.

“We are trying very hard to increase tlic diversity of
the Board nf'l‘rustees," agreed Little, ,

Mail: Walker ’02, risked whetllei there was a chance
oistudent representation on the
board. Having a student serve
with the trustees was part of
SGA President Sean Flammet’s
successful campaign last year,
but Little said such a develop»
ment was unlikely

“We have talked to all ofaur
peer schools, and none of them
have students on the Board of
Tnistecs," he said, also pointing
to concerns about conﬁdential»
ity, conﬂict otintercst and how
students would be selected to serve.

Many students were concerned that campus master
planning was proceeding widiout regard for howthangcs
might impact thcsurroundingcommunrty Rumors were
circulating last year about plans tor a campus entrance,
or “Gates ofGrinr-icll," which one student described as
“ridiculously grandiose and possibly oitensive to the
town." Caroline Little '81, said she was not aware of
any such plan.

Ellen Sale ’01, worried that improvements to the
tampuscould increase thcstudentbody’sinsulanty. ‘We
don't need any more dorms that only face inward," she
said. “We don't need any more buildings you can't see
over.

Jim Edwards ’03, echoed hcrsentiment, saying, “the
architecture ofthc college is one of the most salient ine
dicators of how we view ourselves." Edwards wondered
whether any city residents were involved in the plan.
ning process and criticized the tendency for Grinncll
to atist as a castle on a hill. "

Trustee Todd Linden, a resident of Grinnell and
CEO ofGrlnnell Regional Medial Center, responded
that planners had been holding numerous meetings in
the neighborhoods surrounding the college, payrngspo
cial attention to the issue otparking.

“We will not be a successful college lfthe town of
Grinnell is not successful," added BcibD Musser ’62,

Naomi Treio '01 said that gay and non—white Sm—
dents were sometimes harassed in town, alid asked
whetliersome kind of“sensltivlty training for the town"
was in place.

“That’s :t concern to the community as well," to-
plied Linden. “There are clearly folks in this commue
tiity and across the country as well that don't have die
perspective we would lrko them to have." He added,
however, that students have an obligation to interact
maturely with community residents if good relatione
ships are to be fostered.

Another topic ofdiscussion involved Griiiuell look-

ideas, said Jesse McClelland 01. Earlier in the evening,
Elizabeth Fry '01, had suggested buying more clothing

lemma; while some trustees disliked the idea, Barr sup.
ported it on the grounds that “if there are things the
eollegccan do tosupportlocal industry... l'd think we'd
be all for it."

Shannon Anderson '01, asked why tuition was be.
ing raised again. “We are trying to provide a quality
product, and we are pricing that product lower than
any or our competitors," responded Russell Allen '68.

Fry wondered why such comparisons were neces-
sary. ”Okay, so we're competitive,” she said. “so What?

It's not a business."

“Why is it that we're so concerned with competing
with our peer colleges?" asked Lilliana Radoshevicli '04.

Loewi responded that “competing doesn’t mean be»
ing the same as." While trustees aren't losing sight of
councils unique qualities, he said, the college has to
compete with other institutions in order to draw good
teachers

The bulk oitruttoes' and students attention during
the Forum was focused on sweatshop labor, and the coil»
troversy over the board's recent decision to join both
the Fair Labor Association (FLA) and the Workers"
Rights Consortium (Wits). Allen, who served on the
Presidents Ad Hoc committee on sweatshop Labor,
helded most oitlit questions

Allen siid the trustees decision was based in part
oti the uncertain ruture otboth the FLA and tlieWRc,
“I certainly can't Predict what either ortliese orga ..
tious is going to look like three or tour years from now,"
he said.

Caroline Litile agreed, “Why
is it worse to Join two groups. both
of whom have diiterent ways or
going forward, as opposed to one
or the other?" she asked.

Shannon Herrcruan '04, a
member orctinnell College stu—
dents Against Sweatshops
(GCSAS), responded that Griiinell
College ought to put its name and
reputation behind a socially cone
scious organization.

Locwi, however, cautioned against immediately con-
demning die FLA. “All we’re saying on die board is [diet]
we can't make that judgment now," he said,

While GCSAS claims that the FLA is a smokcscteen
tor sweatshop abuses, Loewi added, there are similar
concerns about the WC. “We can't yust take them at
race value," he said, “We have to be skeptical."

The WRC is largely handed by the labor movement,
“to the extent that it but anyfunding," Loewi said. Since
organized labor has a vested interest in keeping Ameri.
can jobs from going overscu. Locwi said the W'RC may
have an underlying protectionist agenda,

Acoording to Allen, some members of the board
opposed joining either group on the grounds that both
are extremely new. However. it was clear that the col»
lege needed to fund some way or voicing concern.

“Let's belong to both organizations," Loewl tone
eluded. “Let's see which organization is enective over a
period or time."

Not everyone in the audience fell in line with
GCSAS's position. one student. Racltham Hoke ’01,
rose in support orthe trustees' decision. ”I think it's a
very wise thing to be patient here," he said, “1 corn.
mend the trustees for thinking patiently and reasonably
about this."

There was a general sense of fatigue in the room
about the conﬂict between the trustees and GCSAS.
“We love the college, we love the students. and we love
being here," said Randy Morgan '65, “but we don't lovc.
I don't think, an antagonistic relationship,,.. You can't
continue to tunrtion in a totally defensive mode. i play
basketball, and i like to shoot sometimes, andl like to
play dercnse sometimes."

Trustee craig Henderson ended the discussion on
an upbeat note, pointing out that people seldom change
their positions while engaging in a dialogue, but “you
change your course as you let things sink in.

“consensus is intrinsically a very slow process," he
said, “it takes a long time, and it doesn't happen during
the debate,"

After the torum, reaction was mixed. “1 think there's
still a good deal citrustration because many otour be.
liefs are fundamentally diireront about how the [sweat-

' shop] problem should be resolved," said Leah Biy '04.

Paul Ford '02, said ccsus would continue to prcss
the case against the HA. “I don't think their position
has changed at all," he said.

“We've come to an impasse with the trustees," he
continued, “and i think there will have to be a change
in our approach itwc want to make progress on having
that speciﬁc demand tulrilled."

Allen commented, “I thought [the discussion] was
remarkably civilized had the sense that thc tradir

and think aboutwhat other people said evicted through
