by Frances Toddd
Latex: thin, soft, flexible yet
durable. In many ways man’s
best friend. In many ways, that
is, except one important one' it
is not biodegradable. This is
how man’s best friend turns into
his enemy, by filling his sewers
and landfills with massive
quantities of a material that will
never dee mpose. When possir
ble, it is best to substitute paper
for purposes normally sewed by
synthetic materials such as latex.
There are some instances,
though, when substitution is not
possible, and a compromise is
necessary Students With En
roninental Concerns (SECS) ac-
knowledges that, in some eirr
cumsmnces, the use of latex is
necessary; but, SECs also wishes
to make everyone aware that the
current production of latex (and
resulting harm to our environ-
ment) could be cut in half if we
made better use of the latex we
‘ already have. The answer is
recycling.

Already I can hear some of
you asking, “How exactly does
one go about recycling con»
doms?" Let’s take a look.

We start by collecting your
used condoms from the recycling
can on your floor. From there.
we take the condoms to the launr
dry room in the basement of
Main Hall, where work really
gets under way.

~ We have hired professionals
Lrained in the art of condom reha-
‘ bilitation. These experts separate
. the contents of the recycling cans
by color, load them loosely into
~ nearby Maytag washers, add soap,
and with the insertion of a few
‘ laundry chips, the condoms are
t well on their way to becoming
useful members of our campus

‘ community once again
When the load of condoms is
ﬁnished being washed and spun—
. dry our experts hang them up to

finish drying.

The condoms are now ready
. to be prepared for packaging.
Every condom is tested for d —
< feels, Lhen afﬁxed wiUi the On -
‘ nell College logo The familiar

 

bar logo, in the proper shades of
gray and red, is your assurance
that you are receiving a quality
recycled condom.

Our experts then re-roll the
condoms, place them in packets,
and staple the packets securely
shut for your protection.

Voila! The ﬁnished product!

Satisfied with a job well
done, our experts stock the cone
dom machines with quality con-
doms of recycled latex. So, the
next time you're protecting
yourself, protect the future of our
environment also. Buy the con-
doms with the logo that says you
care about where your latex came
from, And most of all, don't
forget to recycle.

SECs brought its concern
about wasteful use of latex to the
attention of the administration of

 

 

Grinnell College and found them
quite receptive. Wally Walker
and George Drake responded im-
mediately by helping SECS
organize and implement a campus
condom recycling effort. Drake
said he was excited not only be4
cause condom recycling will
beneﬁt the environmentl but be-
cause “this movc is sure to thrust
us to the top of US. News and
World Reports ranking of col»
leges." He then excused himself
to take a nap.

By recycling condoms we can
make a difference. This effort can
only be successful, though, with
the full cooperation of the student
body. What can you do to help?
It’s simple. Just toss your used
condoms into the condom recy-
cling can on your floor. We‘ll
take care of Lhe messy details
from there.
