was presented at the Colonial Theatre
last night to a capacity house. Tire
play tceins with l'olliclting good humor
and hroathes much of the atmosphere
or thc original Fitch stories. The
structure or the play depends much on
a ludicrous personality and a spectatrr-
lar seche. Judged item the viewpoint
of pure amusement the play could ease

The acting was more or less rough
and in spots the audicnce grew wear
