The Men’s Forensic society deserves a hearty
word of praise for having the courage to recognize
its own futility and actually do something about
it. That certainly sets a new record of some
sort Or another for college organizations, which so
frequently die a slow death and then permit their
ghost, in the form of an empty title, to haunt
the campus year after year.

It has long been admitted that the member
ship of the organization usually does not in-
clude the best, or at least not all the best speakers
on the campus; and that there are no real duties
for the Forensic to perform.

What activities were once in the field of the
speech society have long since been taken away
either by other organizations on the campus or
by the speech department. ' Speakers have been
brought to Grinnell by the various pro-profes-
sional groups to give information regarding their
individual fields of interest, while all formal
speech work is now under the administration of
the department of speech,

By making the Forensic an honorary organi-
zation the members may breathe new life into the
society. In conferring public recognition upon
the outstanding speakers among the men on the
campus—no more, no less—the club will once
more mean something to Grinnell.

We salute you. The Men's
long live the Men’s Forensic!

MORE FACILITIES NEEDED

Now that winter in definitely with us, with
the traditional accoutrements of ice and snow, the
possibilities of enjoying informal exercise is very
limited for Grinnell college men. With out.
door sports out of the question and the gymna-
sium available only upon very infrequent oc»
casions, the percentage of Grinnell men particie
pating in informal athletics—of which the athletic
department was boasting earlier in the year—has
been abruptly decreased by a very considerable
degree.

Forensic is dead;

When the menso earnestly desire the plea-
sures and benefits of informal sports, it seems
that the college should do what it can in every
way that is Within its means to satisfy this desire.

It is during the winter, especially, that men
should be interested in sports which they can
continue to follow after graduation. At pre-
sent, none of these so called “carry—over” sports
appear on the men’s winter program.‘

It was suggested by this paper last year,
and a number of times since by members of the
athletic department, that the popularity of a
handball court or two undoubtly would many
times repay the very limited cost which would be
involved in their Construction. Even with the
very inadequate facilities for this sport which are
now available, it has grown steadily in popularity,

denominational schools.

and if a regulation court were provided still great-
er interest would probably result.

The prospect of a new Grinnell field house
in the not too distant future is very pleasant to
contemplate, but it must be conceded that at pre<
sent this prospect is very remote. In the meantime
active steps should be taken to provide the school
with additional facilities for winter sports activ-
ities.

The feasibility of constructing one or two
handball courts in the old heating plant, apparent-

ly the most logical location, should at least be
carefully investigated.

L WOULD THEY BE SURPRISEDI

To every Grinnell student who read the ex-
change editorial in the last issue on “Unlimited
Cuts”, the piece must have brought to mind class-
es taken under one OI the two or three Grinnell
professors who are notorious, among their pupils
at least, as extremely “dry” and uninteresting.
What a dire effect unlimited cuts would have
upon the classes of those individuals!

It is not that few in question are not well
versed in» their subjectithis point is not to be
disputed. But it is amazing that men who are
well educated in their particular fields, whose
intelligence is manifested by dangling Phi Beta
Kappa keys, should continue to present their
courses year after year before bored, yawning
classes without investigating the cause of the
patent disinterest and attempting to eradicate it.

One of the pet habits of one of such professa
ors is to pounce upon the desperate answer of an
unprepared student, with two-thirds of the class
wildly waving hands in eagerness to clear up the
situation, and vainly seek to read into the “bluff"
some semblance of meaning. Another Weakness
is to ponderously present two or three iundamen~
tal facts one time after another in slightly diff—
erentiated form throughout a whole class period.
Or he may ask a simple question which all but a
half dozen of the class members offer to answer,
whereupon he proceeds to question the unfortun-
ate six, in the meantime railing at the entire
class for being unprepared.

It is hardly probable that Grinnell will adopt
the system of unlimited cuts simply to expose the
uninteresting professors by virtue of half-filled
class rooms; but how gratifying it would be to
have available some such subtle way of letting
them “get next” to themselves.

Other Opinions

BACK TO SOUP AND FISH
(Iowa State Student)

High collars, cuff buttons, stiff shim, patent leathers
and all the rest of the livery which goes with the form.
al dance will come out of the moth bags tonight for the
first time, And along with them will came the peren»
pial army of “beefers” who spend their time extolling the
:liscomforl‘s of the formal, which, incidentally, no one
:orced them to attend.

Women often wear formal attire, with little more
than a gesture of remonstrance, but when the men of
Iowa State have to climb into the old soup and fish
their cries are loud and long. Think of Edmund Dante
when, sewed in a sack, he jumped into the sea from
his island prison; think of Houndini under the ice in
a straight jadxet; think of exams next week. There are
things far worse than spending the evening in a bow tie
and stilt shirt.

And the rugged midwestem individualism of Iowa
Staters will not be seriously dulled if they try to con.
form [or an evening now and then with the styles and
assume the manners of society’s elite.

WAR SCARE
(Daily Northwestern)

Last week, the frail bark of European peace skirted
a reef for the second time in the last four months. War
scares are getting to be a regular occurrence. This
particular trouble seems to be in hand now; the hat.
headed Slavs have accepted the intervention or the larger
powers, and more than likely, welcomed it. This incl.
dent has demonstrated that the nations of Europe are
willing to go to great lengths to avoid war at the present
time.

Perhaps the press is just a little bit too anxious to
print war scare headlines, and to magnify inocrnational
disco 'ds. The fact that World peace is in a precarious
position cannot be denied, but constantly recurring war
headlines implying that immediate wide spread war is
inevitable tend' to put us in either too militaristic or too
lax a frame of mind. In nearly every case, the develop-
ments are far less serious than the first reports indicave,

At the time of the “machine gun battle" in Louisiana
a few months ago, a German newspaper came out with
the headline “War in America, Long Dictator,” Allowing
that any stir in the Balkans is serious enough to warrant
world—wide attention, the lirst reports might be toned
down a hit until definite developments take shape. Per-
haps we are getting the same exaggeration in our own
papers.

“Human nature does not change,"
contended E. B. T. Spencer, professor
of Greek, in chapel this week.

He opened his series of four talks
by speaking of the nature of quota.
tions and slogans as repositories of the
wisdom of the past. “If true they
have a tremendous influence for good,
but if false they are equally harmful,"
he declared.

it would be better if people were
more discriminating in the use of
quotations, remembering that no mat.
tcr how popular or aged a saying
may be, it is possible it contains lit—
tle or no truth, said the speaker,

“We often hear it said that ‘human
nature does not change,' and this leads
to serious argument at times.” in
order to learn whether human nature
is subject to change, we should study
it from is beginning, Professor Spen—
cer asserted.

Observations prove that man in the
beginning lived an animal existence
he continued, with concern only for
comfort and selfrpleservation. He had
no thought for past or future and was
purely an individualist.

For hundreds of thousands of years
man was little superior to creatures
around him, leaving no evidence of
possessing intellect, imagination or
emot .«d

The first proof of his having rea.
son was when he made a simple stone
tool. The human mind, having lain
almost dormant for so long, suddenly
burst into the age of invention.

From this drawing, sculpture and
painting developed in tum.

Only after men's eyes and heart
opened to beauty, declared the speaker,
did he have a desire for truth. Then
he developed a highly intelligent na.
ture and became a social being with
spiritual aspirations.
in conclusion Professor Spencer re.
marked, “Those who say human nar
ture does not change are woefully
ignorant or deceived. It has been
changing, approximating more and
more closely to the ultimate limit of
the divine."

Book Reviews
Offered Friday
at Special Tea

Three of this season's most out.
standing books were discussed by Mrs.
Robert v. Kerr in the second of a
series of book review teas in the quad.
rangle drawingrroom Friday after.
noon. The teas are sponsored by the
quadrangle social committee and Cap
and Gown.
“Retreat from Glory" by Bruce
Lockhart, author of “British Agent",
is something of an anti.cllmex to his
earlier book, Mrs. Kerr stated, It is
an account of lrickhart‘s life after he
was released from Russia in 1913 in
exchange for Litvinoff.
Forum English Diplomat

Lockhart left the English diplomatic
service to become a newspaper man.
In telling of his journalistic adventure
es, Mrs. Kerr related, he declared that
Geneva was too much dominated by
the spirit of Calvin to be a successful
capital for the League of Nations.

“Wine from These Grapes”, Edna St.
Vincent Millay’s newest volume of
poetry, Mrs. Kerr considers more ma.
ture in style and thought than her
former poems. It contains a group
of nature poems, a section on children,
and a sonnet sequence called “Epitaph
on the Race of Man."

Making of a Saint

Mrs. KeiT read four poems from
the first two sections, but stated that
the Epitaph group should be read
as a whole.

“Salvation" by sholem Asch, the
Polish Jew who wrote the trilogy

”Three Cities," is the mry or the de.
veiopment of a saint. Jcchicl, Mrs,
Kerr explained, was a poor Jew who
through a life of personal suffering
and privation comes to have an end—
less capacity for pity and compassion,
and thereby is looked upon by his
fellow villagcrs as a saint.

Three more hook—review teas will
be held. The date for the next tea
has not been set as yet,
