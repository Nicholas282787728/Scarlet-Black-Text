The Bendix Concert.

Max Bendix was so enthusiast
ically received last year that he
needs no words ot pi-uise tiom
SCARLF arm BLACK to those who
were privtleged to hear hit“, For
those who did not hear him, it may
be well to call attention to a few
of the more notable events in his
career. At the age of twenty he
was chosen concertrnlcistcr ot the
Theodore Thomas Orchestra.
whiehplace he ﬁlled most accepts
ably tor ten years. During the
Vl’orld's Fair he assisted l\’II.
Thomas as conductor of the expo-
sition orchestra of one ltundl'cd
and fourteen artists. He stands
easily at the head of our American
violinists. and we are exceedingly
fortunate in the opportunity of
hearing him a second time. He
is accompanied this year by three
most promising young artists.
Miss Elaine De Sellent occupies
the position held by Jcnny Os
born last year, and Miss Emily
Parsons ﬁlls that of Jeanne Scott.
These artists are both new to us,
but come with as great promise as
last year. and will no doubt be as
heartily welcomed.

Mr. Frederick Citrherry is 3 Val-
uable addition to an already strong
company of musicians. Natural-
ly he is endowed with a sympa-
thetic tenor voice at large coni-
pass. Mr. Curbeiry seems to st rig
because he loves to sing and her
cause it is second nature with him.
Mr. Mathews, cditorofIIII/s‘lt, says,
“He sings with admirable intelli-
gence and musical tooling, and
with that heart which artists put
into work they like.”

Concerts ot such high grade are
an important icatuie in education.
No student can atfoitl to miss a

Mr Dciiison followed with a par
pci on Mr Sheldon's attempt to

spoke of the three departments of
a ncwspnpcl', the news. editorial
and advertising departments, and
how they should be conducted in
an ideal ricwspapci In closing,
the spealtcr said that the question

England’s power on the sea with
Rus as power on the land. and,
in closing, dwelt tor some time on
tht: national characteristics of the
two races, discussing the question
whether the ruling power in the
East will be Saxon or Slav. Mr.
McCarty gave a short talk on
“What I have let not! from debat-
ing." The spealter related some
of his c. pct'icnccs which [to had

in the college. and the beneﬁts
which he had derived tlierefiom.
The debate was next taken up,
the question tor discussion being.
“Resolved, that the city of Grinr
nell sliotild own and operate its
own electric light plant as it does
the waterworks system,” The
debate was extempoianeous. and
the president appointed James E.
Parker to open foi the aﬁﬁrmr
ztivc, and j. A. Meade for the
negative. The other speakers
who took part were Dickinson,
Hayes, Owen, o. Risser and
Crabb. Although the argument
dritted away from the question as
stated, and it was hard to tell
which side some ot the speakers
were upholding. yet the many
witty sayings furnished much
amusement and all present en—
joyet] an interesting debate.
