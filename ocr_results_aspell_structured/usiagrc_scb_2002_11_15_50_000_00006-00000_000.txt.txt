0 The female condom is
currently the only measure a
woman herself can take to
prevent STDs, According the
FDA, effectiveness of the
female condom is 84
percent.

Previously it was thought
that HIV could not be
spread through oral sex, but
at least three cases have
been documented in which a
person contracted HIV
through oral sex.

Condom ineffectiveness is
usually thought to be
attributable to failure on
the part of the user rather
than the condom. Common
user mistakes include failure
to use a condom with each
act of sexual intercourse,
put the condom on before
any genital contact occurs
and completely unroll the
condom.

Factors which may lead to
condom breakage include
inadequate lubrication, use
of latex-weakening oil-based
lubricants and inadequate
space at the tip of the
condom.

Though the most common
contraceptives are the birth
control pill and barrier
methods such as condoms or
diaphragms, other methods
of birth control have
recently emerged, including:
Depo—Provera, an injection
good for three months;
Lunelle, an injection good
for one month; Ortho Evra, a
birth control patch worn for
one week; and the Nuvaring,
a flexible plastic ring that is
inserted into the vagina and
left in for 21 days.
