Athletic Union is out of debt now

only under such conditions can
intercollegiate athletics be carried

THE FINANCIAL sitttatton which
is facing the “(ﬁends ol athletics”
in the University of Iowa at the
present time is nn light matter.
We have not ilie ﬁgures before “5

whole indebtedness must agree

satisfactorily arranged and that
the brilliant prospect for the come

ments of athletics may not fail to
be rcnlized. Wltilcwc sympathize
most heartily with those of our
Univetsny friends who are labor-

of athletics attained there iti
cent years, we cannot but criticise
severely the apathy and absolute
lack oi support on the part of the
students which must be the cause
