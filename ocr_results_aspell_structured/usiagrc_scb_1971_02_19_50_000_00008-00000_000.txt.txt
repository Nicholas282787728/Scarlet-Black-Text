Swimmers Rip Olal, Carlton;
Dual Mark Goes To 6 And 0

The only hope for a Grinnell
team Conference Champions
ship in a Winter sport appe-
ars to be the Swim Team. It
has now won 15 consecutive
dual meets over a two-year
span. This year the team’s
record is 6-0. Their latest
victims were St. Olaf 72732
and Chriton 66*38. ”The
weekend was as boring as the
Olaf crowd,” said one coach.
“They wouldn’t even clap for
their two winners."

Daley was the big winner,
although everyone seemed to
win something. Big Mike was
a double»double winner as
he Whaled in the 200 and 500
events both days. Gabby Ward
won the 100 free both days.
The breast stroke duoofMeye
er and Gibbons was 1’2 borh
days. Prep Dan Weiss took
the 1000 on both days, and the
Medley Relay of Erammer,
C. C. Meyer, Dale,andShortie

Basketball Team Regains Form

Carns was victorious both
days.

Singleday winners were
Mark Williams in the [M with
his season's best at Olaf.
Ha] "I'm a man" Dale won
the fly at Olaf but was humb-
led by a prep at Carlton. Brs
ammer and Flackenstein split
the backstroke winnings over
the two days, and Pontoon suf»
fered his first defeat of his
college career at Olaf, but
bounced back the next day.

Conference may not be in the
bag for 01’ Grinnell as Ripon
College has 8 of the 11 con-
ference's best times by event.
Only Mike Daley interferes
with their record as he mus~
cles his way in the 1000, 200,
and 500 events. Each school
considers the other as the
underdog in the conference
meet. It remains to be seen
which is the her dog.

Justine Time

In 80 66 Defeat By Cornell

I guess the Pioneers can’t
stand prosperity. Or praise.
Or both. They faded once ag'
ain, last Saturday, this time
at Cornell by 80- 66.

Once again, it was a case
of staying cIOse in the first
half, then fading in the sec
ond half. Chuck Patterson and
Bruce Bonnewell hit the bulk
of their 20 and 10 points, rcsr
pectively, in the first half as
the Pioneers closed the stan*
La trailing by only 39732.
However, the Rams began pu-
lling away in the second half,
outscoring the Pioneers, again
by seven, 41*34, for meir fins
al margin.

For once, Grinnell kept the
fouls down, actually outscorr
ing the Rams at the free st-
rip, 14-12. Unfortunately,

however, the Pioneers were
afflicted by a general mai»
aise, as they hit only 38%
from the field to yield a ho-
rrendous field goal advantage
to Cornell as the Rams stuff-
ed in eight more buckets then
did our charges. The Pioneers
also surrendered the rebounds
by a 48740 margin.

In addition to Patterson and
Bonnewell, Robert Burnett
eased in 17 points. Ed Ashe
more led the Rams with 38,
26 coming in the second half.
Next Weekend, Grinnell trr
avels to the much hated Knox
and to Monmouth. All I have
to say on the subject is that
the Pioneers had better not
lose to Knox.

Prep BB Carries 0n Tradition

On the prep scene, the Young
Pioneers are beginning to fole
low in the footsteps of their
elders, the Varsity, and are
losing basketball games ale
so. Maybe the afﬂiction runs
in the family. Last Saturday,
the preps lost to Cornell,
60750 to run their season's
record to 1-5.

Indivdually, however, there
are one or two bright spots:
young Bill Bailey is continu-
ing to rip the cords apart;
he hit for 21 markers $8?
urday. Jeff Jensen did 21 cr-
editable job, also, netting 10
points.

This Wednesday (last Weds
nesday by the time you peo-
ple read this), the young fr-
eshman tangle with Simpson
in an effort to avenge an ear-
lier 98~79 loss. The game
is (was) played at 7:00 p.m.
in Derby. Presumably, Bailey
will can 20 or 30, and, hope-
fully, the preps will win. Unr
fortunately, the Oracles at
Forum want the Word before
the game, so I can make no
definite statements. After all,
my prophecies haven’t always
come true.

Hockey Team Fights‘ln Dark

Yes Virginia, there is a Grin‘
nell College Hockey Club. . .
ho ho ho. Just ask any mem-
ber, if you can find one, and
he will likely disagree or deny
it. Due to graduation (andisn't
that the reason always given
for a poorseason?) this year’s
hockey team doesn’t quite
measure up to what it hasn‘t
been in the past.

Last year, as a club, our Gre
innell team played at the Ice
Arena in Des Moines against
Drake, Graceland, and Iowa
State, as a member ofthe Iowa
Collegiate Hockey League.
This year, however, those
schools joined a larger mid-
west league and left our Grins
nell team out in the cold, as
it were, on beautiful, spaci~
ous, wellslit Barber Plaza.

The team has therefore been
occupying itself with occasr
ional intrasquad' games, ap-
plying the theory of "divide
and conquer." That way, at
least, they never lose. With
John Onstad, Bruce Graham,
"Boom Boom" Aldridge,
"Painless" Mike Kawahara,
and others, leading the char-
ges on goalies Mike Levy and
Jeff Dick, there are usually

a few exciting moments and
an occasional display of hocr
key talent. But the games so
far have been characterized
by fearless rough checking,
hard skating (meaning diffi-
cult, here), looking for the
puck in the dark end of the
rink, and of course getting
the puck out of there.

The team plans to challenge
the Drake team to a game in
Des Moines in the near fut-
ure, as our scouting reports
have indicated that theyaren’t
real strong this year and may
be beatable; probably not by
our team, but somebody’s.
"Wait ’til next year," though.
Our scouting program during
the off season (which implies
an "on" season?) will cover
the States. With Don Aldridge
raking Minnesota; John Our
stad, the DakOtas; Jeff Dick,
Vermont; and Mike Levy, L. A.
and southern California (if it
is still there), we will uncover
all hockey players with high
board scores.

As for the remainder of this
year, more important games
on Barber will get the team
in shape for the Levy Cup,
(Grinnell’s answer to Starr

Clark leadslM Basketball

After three weeks of the IM

basketball season, Clark has

a commanding lead. They pun

lied a full half out in front of

secondrplace Haines and Sm-
ith. However, they have al*
ready outplayed the Smithitcs
on a neutral court, and have
whipped fourth place Readqu-
ite handily.

Bill Dicks continues to lead
Clark with a blistering 22.0
points per game, but is follr
owed closely by Nick Russo,
alleged leader of Wire Mesh,
with 20.3 points per game.
Clark, however, has one ob»
stacle left in' their path. Emr
physema Steve, Wilbur, Oils
and the boys from l-laines are
lying in the bushes, though
we’re not sure what they're
waiting for. They, the Clark
animalsrsalias Hines’ Hoarde
have yet to meet up with the
0C machine, whichwas short~
circuited by Haines due lar-
gely to lack of organization,
whatever that is.

Meanwhile, the interest gr-
oups plod along, generally sle
owed by shoddy play, but they
seem to enjoy themselves out
on the court. The Girls came
within a point of pulling out
their first win. Officiating, it
is rumored, has been helping
them out, particularly when
the Girls played Loose. Kathy
Ellis has been leading the
Girls, although Melanie Cy~

ganowski sank five baskets
in the final period against
Loose to tighten up the score.

In other IM activities, a last
minute cancellation and a chi
ance to play led Penguin
Dave's team to victory in the
umpteenth annual lMpingpong
tournament. The fighting for-
titude from Langan, favored
to win the event this year, en-
countered problems in a Mr.
Robert Noyoe, currently of
Clark Pit. He knocked off the
pre-tourney favorite John
Gordley, and then aftEr falling
to hallmate Bill Chown in the
semifinals, @1116 back towin
semi-finals, came back to
whip Ken Gordon, alsoof Lane
gan and anorher preetourney
favorite, to make it to the
the finals, where he took third
place. Chown took second, and
Gordon fourth as Clark surged
ahead in the exciting Trues-
dale Trophy race over Road,
which chose to ignore the
tourney this year. Clark took
first overall, langan second,
and Heines third.

be without while in the goal.
Anyway, stop by Barber some
time when you hear the sound
of pucks bouncing off those
black boards or when you see
skatErs wearing funny looking
red shorts, carrying curved
sticks (or beating each other
over the head with them). You
may nor witness a good qual*
ity of hockey playing. As a
matter of fact, the other day
I asked an onlooker as we
were playing how he liked
our game. He made it clear
that he still preferredhockey.

Indoor Track Team
Bags 3rd At lamoni

Grinneli's Indoor Track Sq-
uad unveiled itself last Mons
day night by placing third in
a track meet at Lamoni. The
'Star' of the meet for Grinnell
was the debonaire Phil Mor-
ales who finished first in the
440 and 600 yard runs. Other
pinnacle performers for the
land-jocks were Eric Jahn in
the mile, (Don’t worry Jim
Ryan!) and Chuckie McGrath
in the two mile event(7). Eric
also was second in the 1000,
while Chuck came in third in
the 880.

In the pole vault, the ‘wone
der boys" from Alton staged
a duel amongst themselves
for second place. The outcome
was youth over wisdom, as
Dougie Mendenhall beat his
buddie Christian Madsen.

Other placers for Grinnell,
led by that universal man on
campus Ric McStick, were
Paul Lewis gaining a second
in the 300 and Carl Brennen
with a fourth in the longjump.
The next meet is at Drake on
Monday , possibly featuring

highlight and sidelight of the
Carlton meet was that young

in his match.

At St. Olaf the team did not
