51,00 per song..The dart boards will run 25
cents per peroonTlre revenues from both will count towards the
50 percent quota.

positive. 1 like the darts, said Parker lto'ester 09. The jukebox
makes it a lotbetter."

The appearance of Lyle’s, while stiuctui'ally the same, has
undergone many changes with more on the way. Ballew hopes
to add more artwork and possibly giaﬂitl to one otthe interior-
