SGA discovers
$36,638 fund

For years, treasurers stored
extra money in "SGA trust”

8V ABBY RAPOPORT

Although initially the concert committee did not
have enough funds to bring Cake to campus last year,
520,000 suddenly appeared and the show went on.

The money was taken out of a formerly secret
SGA account known to only the SGA treasurer and
assistant treasurer. This account, which has been re,
ceiving all the funds not spent by the SGA at the
end of each year, currendy has $36, 638 This figure
represents roughly ten years ofSGA savings accord
ing to SGA Presidentjohn Bohman 06

Before the Cake concert, the account had rough-
ly $58,000. Although the fund has atlsted for almost
a decade, it was only recently ruade known to meme
bets of the cabinet, due, in large part, to the efforts
of curient treasurer Matt Cleinman ’06.

“I'm a big believer in openness and I didn't nec~
essarily agree with kceping it quiet,"C1cinman said.
“I lobbied the few other people that knew about it
to make it open."

Bohmann discovered the account after reviewing
the numbers regarding the cake concert. “I was like,
‘This just doesn't make sense'...and when I asked
Matt he suddenly got evasive.”

In fact, Cleinman was only following the general
procedure established by years of treasurers. “People
were basically vague and unclear," but, he added, “I
wouldn’t say deceitful."

The 85000 taken from the account each semes-
ter is marked in the budget as “SGA Endowment."
However, this money is somewhat unimportant, as it
almost always gets ﬁltered back into the account as
unspent SGA money

"We all
knew that [left
over funds]
wouldn’t roll
over," said
senator Linn
Davis '08. "We
just thought
[they] disap»
peared."

Bohman agrees that not enough is known about
SGA’s monetary affairs. “People don't have a handle
on the budget outside of the treasurer," he said.

This leaves senators like Davis questioning the
treasurers power. “It just seems sort ofsketchy that
that much money was sitting around without it be-
ing widely known," he said,

Past treasurers, however, fclt strongly that the ac
count ought to be kept secret. According to Clem-
man, some worried the accountwonld remove pres»
sure on cabinet members to stay in budget l—lowevcr,
Clcinman himself is less concerned about this. "I
personally think cabinet members are responsible
enough stay in budget," he said.

Cleinrnan said another concern regarded the
feelings of student groups whose requests for funds
were rejected.

Davis said he does not see this as an important
concern. "We fund almost all reasonable requests
and some unreasonable requests for money. 1 don’t
think student groups have [suffered from a] lack of
funds," he said. "If anyone should feel slighced, its
students that have already graduated."

Going public with the account leaves the SGA to
decide what will happen to the remaining $36,638

Crady, Osgood consider Pub

Next year, students looking for a bar might be able to go to the Campus Center

By TRYMORE MAGOMANA AND LOLA GAitcm

A pub may return to campus after a nearly twordecade long
absence, if Vice President of Student Scivices Tom Crady has his
way.

Crady is looking at plans to reintroduce a pub on campus and
is not alone in hi efforts Piesident Russell Osgood has offered his
support for Crady s proposal

Bob's Underground currently occupies the spree lettvrcrnt when
the pub was shut down in 1986 About 20 years ago, the pub was one
ofthe primary social gathering spots

“T he pub was popular with students, said Wrr 'ne Moyer Politir

Osgood cxpl' td the ’Klonﬂlc behind the teiiitioduetion oftlic

mg and exerting bub ofcarupus life and maybe a pub would be part
of that."

The possible return ofthe pub has been welcomed by some stu—
dents,

SGA Presideiitjohn Bohinan'Oo said an onecanipus pub would
be good fol safety. “[A pub] Will enhance security. Some students

have been assaulted touring back from the pub downtown." He
added, “it will preterit drinking and driving since students will be
drinking right here at the college."

Other students also thought the idea ofa dunking establishment
would be a positive change,

“It's good to have a pub here at the college’rhen, I don’t have to
stumble blindly home from the pub downtown,” said Evan Miller
’07.

Kinnear’l'heobald ‘08 also though an on-eanrpus pub would be
safer than current drinking patterns.

“I think it's a really good idea. it prevents alcohol poisoning.
Students wrll stop hiding in their rooms, consuming huge amounts

of alcohol," she said. “I think that's ii
wasted plan."

Tom Petei‘ 06 thought the pub

Peter also wondered how
the pub would function and
who would have access to it, given that a msjority of students rile
under the minimum drinking ige
Ciady has responded to these and other conccrns with a familiar
refrain. “Most of our peer institutions have pubs, so it not i new
thing, he said Osgood agreed that Giinnell would not be breaking
new ground in thc cintroduction ofa pub on campus.
cirrtiy at uni it is possible that the pub would be open to all
students not just those on drinking age. ‘The pub will serve both
alcohol and food, like a restaurant, and this will make it possible for
everybody to visit it,"
