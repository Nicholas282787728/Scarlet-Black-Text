Hell in Grinnell

RlNNELL

ltl

by Bull

I'm madder than a Grlnnell student
without a resource center and I'm not go-
ing to take it any more. I’vejust had it with
those pinko commies on this campus who
want to restrict my godrgiven right to own
a funnelator.

The piiikos on this campus have abs
solutely no conception of actually how
Close those Huskies really are!!! Why its
only a week's drive from Iowa!“ Well I
tell all you pinkos at Student Affairs and
SGA that I don‘t care what you say, when
those Ruskies Come marching down
highway 6. I'll have my lunnelator ready
to protect what is rightfully mine.
especially my Grinnell letter jacket! ll

1 truly believe that this great American
nation of ours was built on the funnelatoi‘.
Why in the old West. the early settlers
would pull out the trusty funnelator and
protect their women and children from the
savage indians, And when we went to
Europe to kick Hitler's butt, do you think
we just brought rifles'l Why of course not.
The terror for hundreds of Nazi soldiers
was the dreaded funnelator.

The funnelator has always been an im-
portant element in American culture and
society, Why. I remember as a little boy
going out hunting with my daddy's favorite
funnelator lcan still remember that time
i bagged my iirst grizzly with my very own
funnelator, You know, I mean that first
funnelator kill is when you really become a
man

So l've had it with Grinnell wimpslll
The time to change this red school is now.
All Grinnell students have the Constitur
tional right to bear arms. and that means
lunnelators‘ ll As a true blood American I
refuse to let this American tragedy occur.
The commies at this school wil get my time
nelator when they peel it out of my cold.

While most of the world remains cons
cerned with hunger crisis, Central
American and Libyan military
developments. and the state of U.S.-Soviet
relations, an international tragedy con»
tinues to be ignored 7 the plight oi the
Ends. But help may soon arrive from
HELL L.

Ends have always been elusive
creatures. as evidenced by numerous
historical, and futile, quests for the “Ends
of the Earth." Today, the most prominent
signs or their existence are nondescript
markers along cul-desacs proclaiming the
sites of their demise and bearing only the
words “Dead End," These fatalities ap-
parently result irom traliic accidents, as
Ends are not known {or their driving
abilities 7 they’re constantly getting
reared

known as HE L.L. iHelp Ends Live

sites and Ceremonies for Dead Ends. as
Well as provide homes for their Children so
they won't be iorced to live as Endorphlns.

A virtual eternity of H E L.L. studies in-
dicate the existence of three major
subspecies oi Ends: the schizoid Split
Ends: the miserly Tight Ends. and the
scholarly Book Ends. H,E.L.L. has propos
ed that selected American colleges
establish campus sanctuaries iactually
mere expansions oi current End-zones) in
order to provide therapy ior the Split and
right Ends. and unlimited library
facilities {or the Book Ends.

Counsellors would be responsible for
making Ends meet. These efforts will
decrease'the likelihood of Endrless love ate
fairs. Also, since Ends are such poor
drivers, they would be iurnished widi En
dorses upon which they could irolic about
their peaceful abodes in pursuit of Endear.
Toe. the Endure produced by these, and
other livestock, could be sold by the col»
leges as fertilizer.

Finally, the organization wishes to duly
recognize the accomplishments of outstan»
ding Ends. Humans speak of the "End of
the Road." the “End of the Year," and
even the “End oi Time," yet neglect to
show these Ends due respect, lRodney

those or a religious nature. warn their
members of the "Coming of The End”
H.E.L.L. in5isis that The End is nothing to
be afraid of, and also seeks to dispel the
many misunderstandings about Ends in
general.

Grinnell may well benefit by cone
tributirlg to H,E.L.L 's Endeavors.
However, if a sanctuary is established, ex-
ploitatlon oi the new community could
become Endemic. Students having
academic difficulties may resort to putting
an End to it all

A related column next week will deal
with the Means. since they’ve always been
justilied by The End. Until then, it you
should see and End, go ahead. make his
day The End.

Since Amann went public With his

Ted was such a nice guy. . [used to ba e

Political Science professor Jon Hurwitz
said. “this kind of election often occurs in
races where there is widespread public

apathy." Hurwitz went on to add, “that
lnost often, the media is to be blamed for
not iniorming the public about the political
freaks.”

SGA secretary Diane Peters agreed with
Hurwitz in his criticism of the S&B. Peters
said, “That's right, you guys at the YGS

Yet. in the face of all the heat, Amann
