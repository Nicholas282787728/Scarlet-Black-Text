on this year as a basis for
a few predictions for next

Group Lauds 'Hank' At Dinner

Humorous and serious sentiment were combined pleas-

a memorial dinner at the Country Club.

baseball bat to be signed by
Brown and each succeeding
dean. Cassiday also gave
Brown a little tin horn, so he

whistle to awaken North
campus" as he did spring nay.

Youthful Enterprise

If you have noticed certain enterprising young men
contributing their services to make Grinnell college a pret-

tier place, you can thank Dean Brown and tlle administra-
tive committee.

A Smith junior and senior are giving of their free
time eighteen hours of labor on the campus for being in»
volved in a recent break in of the Cowles kitchen. They
‘are being disciplined for their participation.

Two South Younlcer sophomores are contributing thir-
teen hours for being involved in the theft of cigarettes
from the campus Chesterfield representative. They also had
to make restitution for the cigarettes already smoked,

A Dibble sophomore, for conduct unbecoming to a col-
lege student, was fined ten hours of cleaning the grease pit
following the Wednesday night fire on Park street.

This is the total so far. We’re sure there will be more
and we like it. Dean Brown’s feeling was that suspension
is not a suitable punishment for social misconduct. This is
because students are forced to miss their academic life
and does not affect their social life as it should.

Previously minor offenses as well as major offenses
were punished by a period of suspension from the school.
In reality this meant, in many cases, that the entire semes-
ter was wasted. It also meant that faculty were put to the
bother of extra sessions With the delinquent pupil.

This does not mean that suspension of students will
not occur, but rather that only major offenses will be so

punished.

A fine of two dollars is nothing in the majority of the
men’s pockets but their time is invaluable. We've finally
hit on a solution which may well end many of the jokesters'
careers (Anyway it will put them more underground.) We
salute Dean Brown and the administrative committee which

The high point of the eve-
ning came after a speech by
Acting President Rupert a
Hawk, when Robert Peterson
(men‘s physical education)
presented Brown an electric
bench saw, a gift from his
friends.

Earlier in the evening, “Hank"
received several gifts that are
high in sentlmental, if not mon-
etary, value. The c of HP pre-
sented him a box of Pillsbury
biscuit mix with their own “rec

a “trophy" crowned with a
whisky bottle in recognition of
his battle against the violators
of the drinking rule.

SC Rules Change

The newly revised Student
Council constitution was ap-
proved by students Monday
night at housemeetings. The
revision, an attempt to clari-
fy the structure and func-
tions of the council, was ac-
cepted by an overwhelming
majority of the students.

Anne Patterson, student

at last night’s meeting, said
that the constitution will go
next to the raculty committee
on Student Organizations tor

Anne also reported that the
new soft drink machines which

An Open Letter to i-lcnry
A. Brown, retiring Grinnell
College Dean oi luen:

individually and collectively,
the men or Cowlcs Hall have
sometimes disagreed and been
openly critical of the pOIiCles of
the present Dean of Men

However, we have a deep»
rooted respect and a basic, es-
sential liking for a man who
has an extremely diiiicult role
to play.

We feel that he has been
forthright, just, and sympathetic;
a new Dean of Men will have
an outsize pair of shoes to nu.
Personally and as a group we
feel that Grinnell is losing an
exceptional human being and a
damn fine Dean or Men.

Our very best wishes for
every kind of success in what-
ever you do.
