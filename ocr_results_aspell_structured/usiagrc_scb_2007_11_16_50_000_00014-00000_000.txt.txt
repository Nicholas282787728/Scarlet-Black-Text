$100 for seven-year-
old beer? Welcome
to Alumni Weekend

“It you want to hear the real story about
James Taggart puking lan Warlick '10
recounts while we talk in the Grill, “Alumni
weekend is the only time you'll get a chance.”
Warlick is alluding to the men and women
swim team’s alumni weekend. when retired
swimmers ﬂock to campus from all over the
us. for a tew short days otswrmming, partye
ing and reminiscing.

The events start on Friday with an intere
squad meet, giving teammates the chance to
compete in a rclavcd, fun environment.

“The interteam meet is meant to get people
on the blocks, get people to swim fast and to
see where people are at," eaplruns senior cape
tain Sean \Varlick’OS.“It's [also] great because
the alums will come down onto the deck and
mingle with the current team members."

Saturday's activities begin at noon with
the Alumni Relays, where current swimmers
match up with former Grinnellians,some who
haven‘t swam eompctitively in over 25 years.

scan Warlick docs admit, however, that oc-
casionally the alumni bring their Aegarne.

“They have beat us in the past," he con-
cedes. “Like last year, they beat us by a couple
tenths in the 200 free. Granted, that was the
school recordeholding teamt But this year we
drilled ‘em into the ground by about three
seeonds,We sent them back to the retirement
community.”

Once the relays end, there's a relatively
short water polo game, everyone hits the ShOW’
ers and then quickly heads off to dinner, which
starts around 6 pm.

"The dinner is the best way for everyone to
bond,” says Lily camp ’10,“becausc the arste
and second—years don’t really know the older
swimmers and dinner gives us a chance to talk
about something other than swimming.”

After a break for digestion, the party starts
in the swimmer House attic and lasts deep
into the night, with this year’s gala reportedly
ending around 4 a.rn.

The whole weekend brings out the camara-
derie that exists between generations orswinae
mers. “The team’s one big family and [alumni
weekend] is just a chance for everyone to
see each other," captain Allie Kossoy ’08 said.

"It's a great time to continue traditions and
learn why things are the way they are,” said
lan Warlick. "Like why we sing ‘Build Me Up
Buttercup."

It's also a way for alumni to spend their
paychecks. At the team’s annual auction, the
alums get to bid on such sentimental material
as a phone call with head coach Erin Hurley
(522) and a seven—yearold beer left in swim-
mer House (3100).

“Usually it's stuff taken from the storage
room,“said scan Warlick.

But really, [an Warliek acids, it’s about the
fun for the alumni. “We're sort oflike an inces-
tuous, drunken family.”he joked.

Basketball set to begin MWC title defense

BYMATT ZMUDKA

With a little bit of proverbial oil and The
System, head coach David Arseneault and the
Pioneer men‘s basketball team are ready to
ﬁght once again.

Preseason expectations typically run high
for Grinnell, but more so this year than others.
The team enters the season ranked first in the
MWC preseason poll and guard John Grot-
berg ’09 has been named to the d3hoops.com
preseason All-America team. All ﬁve “finish-
ers" from last year are returning: Grotbcrg,
along with fellow guards David Arseneault '09
and Bobby Long '09, forward Mike Schmidt
'08 and center Keith Chamberlain ’08. The
team also returns eight other letter-winners
and will add a strong class otsererrtrrst years
to round out the team's oversizcd rostcr.

To get The system running smoothly,
Grinnell will likely utilize everyone on the ros-

ter. “We're going to get all 20 kids out there,"
Arseneault said. For those new to the world of
Grinneil basketball, “The system" emphasizes
tast breaks, threeepointers, and pulling down
offensive rebounds to create an absurd amount
ofsconng. Squads play all out for about a min-
ute until Arsenault subs a new team of ﬁve,
NHLestyle, into the game.

“It's the most competitive team I’ve ever
had,"Arsencault said. Praising the work ethic
of the team, he added, “I’ve been able to back
off on coaching a lot. They've been through
this so much i haven’t had to do any pushing."

The Pioneers begin their season with a
challenge this weekend at the Buzz Levick
Tip-Off Tournament at Wartburg tonight
against Wiscons‘ineEau Claire. Depending
on the result, the Pioneers will move on to
face the Winner/loser of the Aurora»Waitburg
game on Saturday.

Last year, Mike Schmidt '08 attempted
168 threevpointers, most of them probably
coming from the same few spots on the
court. In contrast, he attempted only 10
shots from inside the arc.
