An Explunuion by the Editor.

In the last issue of this paper there appeared tour editorials
which were written by candidates tor the editorial board ot the
the Scarlet and Black but which rild not attempt to represent
the views or policies of this organ. The first, by Hunter L.
Scott, stated that often college protessors are boring in
class rooms; the second. compiled by William S. D. Clark,
listed certain topics which opinion will not allow an editor
here to discuss; the tiilrd, by Aileen iliiligan, complimented
the enterprise at students who will glye some original plays to-
night and the last. by Kenneth Clayton, discussed some recent
events in Grinncll prepping.

The Iii-st and iourth were no doubt indiscreet and the sec-
ond has been taken by some as an attack on the Grlmlell press
reputed by students to be among the most outspoken in the col-
lege world, The paper, however, did not hesitate to print these
editorials because it was believed that once each year students,
Without. other restriction than the absolute bounds of truth.
should say what they believe in the Scarlet and Black. It
was thought that to out an editorial on other
grounds than untruth would he a breach of taith on the part

leave

of the editor who, until a new editorial hoard is formed, could
not justly establish an editorial policy.

Already two editorials have been submitted expressing dif—
iereat views of the same question. One was printed in the
last paper and the other was to be printed in this one. The
news staff of the Scarlet and Black. representing student opin-
ion, was to choose which ot these views it cared to have taken
in its' editorial columns.

D'Idenlly such is not the case. The editor, since he is
responsible {or what he publishes whether he believes it or not,
is expected to choose tryout editorials according to opinions
expressed in them. He is, by printing editorials which conform
to his personal views, to select whomever he chooses to work
with him. ‘ ‘

it seems only logical that, as the matter stands, the editor
must appoint his ow board on the theory that he ought to
know whose views a e most nearly like his own. There w
be less embarrassment both (or him and those who are candi—
dates tor the board. Members at the board must be expected
to work with the editor writing his views, expressing his
thoughs and resigning when they can no longer honestly state
his opinions. .

While it is hoped that the indiscreet statements of Saturday
will not be taken as a sample at, Scarlet and Black editorial
comment, the paper will continue to take a stand on questions
which aiise in Grinnell. As was hinted a week ago, the new
management will foster the more liberal policies or Grinnell
such as voluntary chapel, a reasonable cut system and student
government will continue to take a calm hut critical view of
local shortcomings realizing that other schools may have these
same taults but hoping that Grinnell may overcome them.

To the Editor ot the SCARLET AND
BLAC
Dear Sir
In x editorial “The Great God
Trad on" I was untortunate in my
expression. it was directed against
those few professors who could make
their classes more interesting by re-
lating their subjects with the every-
day world. i did not feel that my
statements were applicable to any
particular departments in Grinnell;
using the three I did as possible ex-
amples only. I feel that there may
have been misunderstanding on the
part of some, and theretore injustice
to the departments mentioned on‘
my part, and i wish to apologize (or!
it.
Sincerely,
Hunter L, Scott.

To the Scarlet and Black,
Grinnell College,
Grinnell, Iowa.

Although the conditions of innova-
tion and reorganization which inevit-
ably tali to the lot of a. new manage-
ment should rightly he considered by
the tolerant as justification tor the
follies of inexperience, there are cer-
tain ofienses against good taste and
standards of common courtesy which
cannot be condoned by any who claim
for themselves a proper perspective
on the educational situation at Grin-
nell,

Even under the head of editorial
tryout, it seems scarcely permissable
that the trivial babble of the mob
spirit should be allowed to grace a
sheet which claims for itself the vir-
tues of “independent conservatism."
Consequently, it is a. matter of con-
siderable irritation to those who have
honestly at heart the interests of
Grinnell, the Scarlet and Black Ila,
self, and the student-faculty relational,
that vacuous, inconsequential, andl
discourteoiis remarks should he coun-
tenanccd even under the tryout ban-
ner Of the paper's editorial columns.

It is inevitable that any campus
must shelter a few choice intellects
whose sole preoccupation consists in
making plnrscrntches on the clay feet
of "The Great God Tradition." Such
Dimscratches. however, must chal—
lenge the righteous resentment of,
those in whose name they are made.
tor the majority or students tor whom
the academic tradition has any meal-ls
ing whateveriand these are more
numerous than students themselves
will admit—do not welcome the prev
sumptuous congratulations of one wh
is obviously committed to the precon—
ceived and puerile idea that profes-
sor is a synonym for pedant, or that
all students must find a certain type
o1 class boring.

Grinnell students should pride
themselves in being fair enough to
admit, that should the faculty choose
to adopt a similarly uncomplimentary
attitude, much justifiable verbiage
could be mustered concerning stu-
dents with a more than equal lack of
fluency, of ideas, even of willingness
to relate their academic pursuits to
the next iifty years or their lives.

Any class may be boring to a cerv
tain type of intellect, particularly to
that which ilnds within iEelf the ego»
tistlcal fortitude to criticise the pauc-

in the same breadth with which it
considers "aboundance" the proper
way to spell "abundance." Neverthe-
less, it remains within the province
of that majority who can still ﬁnd
within themselves ample appreciation
for Grinnell’s {acuity to resent sinv
cereiy such irresponsible expressions
of hlzses, which are unworthy of the
nameot opinions, in the columns of a
paper which is presumably devoted
to the interests of the students,
Alter all. extravagant scoffing at
tradition is only the opposite extreme
of extravagant servility to it; both
have an equally demoralizing effect.
Grinnell has not maintained herself
in the past on a record of either one
or these extremes. The burden or her

 

tuture rests on students and facility
together. hetore student criticism can
be wholly justifiable and trenchant,
it must be judicial; it must rest on
a inundation of openvmindedness and
fair-play, on respect and courtesy.
Only then will it be constructive and
faithful to the real spirit of higher
education.
Katherine Simons.

To the Editor oi the SCARLET AND

BLACK:

Dear Sir:

In the last. issue a! the SCARLET
AND BLACK appeared two editorials
dealing with "Tradition" and "Prep-
ping" which were Written by tryouters

 

tor the editorial board. These edi~
torials aroused a great deal or feeling
over the campus because oi the brutal
and uninformed method of handling
the material.

Sinnevcastlrtg and mudrslinging are
ancient methods ot amusement and
because of custom have become quite
legitimate, and yet it is depressing to
see such an attitude displa -ed in the
oIiicial paper of an educational instir
tution, This letter is no cry against
frcedorn of speech and expression oi
the cold though uhbeautitul iacts oi
lite. It is a protest against aspiring
young rciormers who leap into a ti-
rade of abuse with neither the age
nor the facts to judge Clem-Iv.

Could this next bit of criticism he
entitled ”.Let him who is without sin?”
The author of the “Tradition” edi-
torial launched a bitter attack against
certain departments and complained
of the antiquity of methods and lack
of modern application to current
events. And yet certainly nothing
could be more medieval than the
childish method or singling ollt cer-
tain departments or the highahanded
and biased method or attack. Could it
be that a greater appreciation of the
tow homely and humble precepts
which may be gathered Irom these
courses would en'tble the author to
avoid such an exlli on or bad taste?

The author ot "Prepping" showed
a most prodigous knowledge or both
the present and the iutllre, Not only
did he attempt a continental attitude
toward our crude Chaplin type of
American humor, but he predicted the
Iiiture of several fellow treshmcn.
This letter will not deiend prepping,
but it will detend any , stem against
the journalistic brain child of a man
who has neither “preppet” nor been
“prepped. " His dramatic call tor stit-
dent enforcement suggested the pic-
ture or a heroic general crying for
support against a glowering and man-
evolent enemy. Might not the same
precept as given to the ﬁrst author
he used with regard to this writer?
Perhaps a thorough understanding
and application of “prepping" in a
certain localized region would trims-
mit to the brain of this tevered res
former a greater knowledge of prev-
ping and the world in general.
