Although the Oklahoma Aggie quin-

plenty of worry during their lowa in.
vasion over the last. weekend, the Cow.
boys still lacked finishing punch and
consequentl lost both games; Drake
won 2 in an o artime tilt. while
the Fun is were vi .s, 31 to 23.

Tulsa met with the same fate as the
Aggies in its two game trip through
the Hawkeye state, but failed to furn-
ish as much opposition. The Golden
Hurricane assumed no more than
zephyr.like intensity against the Bull.
dogs and Pioneers, losing to them 45.
25 and 46.21 respectively.

Pioneers on Top

A5 a result of last weekend's games
Grinneil remains undisputed leader in
the conference with seven wins and a
pair of deleats. Creighton holds sec.
and place by virtue of one more v1 .
tary than Drake or Washington, the
third place quintets.

The Jays lost a golden opportunity
to pull into a tie with the Pioneers
Friday when they were upset by
\Vashingtan 2633. On Saturday they
met with better success against Wash-
burn, downing the Ichabuds in another
close game, 32-28.

than its toes. The Oklahoma Aggies,
the hard luck team of the loop, have
scored on the average on only 1.6
points per game less than their oppon.
ents, in spite of their position in the
loop Cellar, Weshburn has a mark oi
minus two, and Tulsa of minus 7.3,

Pioneers Avenge
Earlier Tulsa Defeat

Revenge was sweet to the Pioneers
Saturday night as they gained an
overwhelming 46.21 victory over a
Tulsa university team which had ad.
ministered a 51.33 defeat to them dur.
ing the southern road trip early los-
week

Paced by Oliphant and Mason who
collected a total of 26 oi the team’s
46 point! the Grinneii team early
forged into the lead and successfullv
maintained its advantage through
the game. Oliphant looped in si
iield goals and three free throws to
take the individual scoring honors for
the evening, although he was closely
{allowed by Mason who collected a
total of 11 ponts on five field goals
and a free throw.

Tulsans Narrow Margin

The Tulsa team narrowed the score
to 10.7 mid-way in the first. halt, but
a scoring spurt by Grinnell again
widened the margin and the count was
19.9 at the hall time.

Coming back at the start of the

, .ncxpcrienec.

second hall Grinnell again unleashed
a scoring drive and looped in a series
of shots which soon brought the score
to 30 to 15. The Oklahoma passing
attack was functioning smoothly. but
they were unable to take advantage
of this tact. due to their inability to
locate the hoop.
Grinncll Substitutes Score

Late in the second half Grinneli
made numerous substitutions without
appreciably slowing up the attack
which continued to net points, iinally
bringing the score to 46.21 as the game
ended.

Tulsa displayed a fast passing attack,
but was handicapped by their inabil—
ity to hit the basket. Larson, chief
scoring threat of the visitors, was
held to 10 points by the Grinnell de—
fense, He was followed in scoring by
Kilpatrick, rangy center, who hooked
in three one—handed shots to give him
second scoring honors for his team

Freshmen Cagers Play
Marshalltown Saturday

The prep basketball team’s first
home appearance will take place Sat.
urday night at 7:15 o’clock in the men’s
gymnasium. At that time Marshall.
town Junior oollege, victorious in the
first game between the two teams
played last Friday, will give the fresh.
men a chance for revenge.

The probable starting line—up, ac.
cording to L. L. Watt, freshman coach
will include Riley and Dean. iorwnr
Hayward. center; and Trautwein and
Evans, guards. orhor men who will
in all probability see plenty of action
Watt stated, are Do lacy, and Snow,
guards, and La. Masricy, Stanley, Bur.
gel', and Rodemeyer, iorwards.

Watt stated 'nlesdoy that Grinnell
fans could expect a good, fast game,
as the ireshman squad is improving
rapidly. Their only handicap will be
as Marshalltown has
played 12 games to Grinnell’s two. it
is highly probable. however, that the
frosh will be able to suimont this
obstacle, Watt said.

Semester tee books will admit to
the game.
