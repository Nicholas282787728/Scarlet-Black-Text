The Grinnell College women’s softball
team is reducing its schedule for the 1987
season. After much discussion. the
12-member team, Coach Jim Gilbert, and
athletic director Dee Fairchild reached a
decision to play an abbreviated season
against area community colleges and
withdraw from Midwest Conference soft-
ball this year.

While many teams go through rebuilding
seasons, the Pioneers literally must start
from the ground up. With the loss of six
seniors last year and no freshman recruits
to replace them this year, the team began
practicing with just eight members, only
five of whom saw considerable playing
time last year. Newcomers with little or no
ptevtous playing experience comprise the
remainder of the squad.

Aside from the few numbers and max
perience of the team as a whole, Gilbert, in
his first season as head coach, cited

several external considerations affecting
the decision. He noted the “high caliber of
conference competition“ against which
Grinnell finished 0-10 last year and added
that eight of those games went only five in-
nings due to the lovrun rule.

“The decision to pull out of the cons
[erence this season is not based simply on
winning or losing." Gilbert said. “From a
realistic standpoint, we can’t even be com-
petitive right now.”

He continued, “We're at the lowest point
in the program, and we just need time to
reconstruct. There was no recruiting done
last year, and that is the key to the
revitalization of this program.”

Gilbert is engaged in a vigorous
recruiting campaign this year, but as he
pointed out, “Only time will tell if our con-
centrated. ongoing efforts prove suc
cessful so that we can field a somewhat
competitive team next year.”

 

Track Places Well
At Conference

The oppressive heat at the University of
Chicago's track the weekend before hreak
could not keep the Grinnell College men‘s
indoor track team from placing higher in
the Midwest Conference Championships
than any other previous Grinnell squad.
The women’s indoor track team had an ex
cellent meet as well, placing impressively
and posting numerous personal bests.

“Our team continues to improve," said
men's coach Will Freeman, “We wanted to
be a little closer to Cornell, but we were
happy to finish second. It's proof that hard
work pays dividends."

Cornell, the first-place team with 120
points. had its strength “in five quality
people," Freeman said. “We had better
depth, but championship scoring favors
the teams with a handful of top~notch peor

1e.”

p Adding points to Grinnell's second-place
effort of 77.5 were double scorers Walt
Maley, who barely missed a school record
with his first-place finish in the 600 (1214.6)
and set a new school standard with his
fourth-place performance in the 300; Rob
Parker, who was edged at the line in both
the 400 and the 800 and finished second in
both; and Dave Jones, who secured third
in the long jump and sixth in the 600.

Phil Lefebvre ran a superb 1000 for

third; Jonathan Love and Kent Koth raced
to fourth and fifﬂi respectively in the mile;
and Dave Wisdom ran to an impressive se-
cond place in the two mile.

Both men’s relay teams also scored well.
Tom McCullen. Jones, Craig Whitaker,
and Maley in the 4 by 200 meter relay pac-
ed an extremely close race, but placed
third partly because another runner in
terfered with the exchange. Parker, Mc~
Cullen, Austin Simmons, and Maley in the
mile relay also got third place.

"As individuals, we performed as well
as I had hoped," said women’s Coach
Evelyn Freeman. “Everyone had their
best times for the season, but this cons
ference meet was much tougher than it has
been in the past.”

St. Norbert dominated the meet, ac-
cumulating 144 points, followed by Chicago
with 67, Cornell with 64, and Grinnell with
so. “I believe every team member was

Men Swimmers
End Winning Streak

Courtesy Sports Information Office

The eight-year reign of Grinnell College
as Midwest Conference men's swimming
champion e the longest streak in league
history for the sport 7 came to an end here
last weekend before break.

Stocked with strong veterans and tore
tified with several outstanding freshmen,
Lake Forest unseated the Pioneers, 610 to
532. Chicago was third with 256 points,
followed by Coe with 176. Lawrence with
92, Ripon wiui 61, Knox with 52, Cornell
with 49, and Beloit with 44.

The top two teams swept all the first
places. Although the Foresters ac-
cumulated 12 firsts to go with six for Grins
nell's “Buddhamen,” the electric spirit at
the Physical Education Complex
generated seven conference records and
several close finishes.

Even with the streak broken, Grinnell
coach Ray Obermiller had many positive
observations,

“It was a great event ~ probably the
best overall conference meet in history in
terms of the keen competition. depth of
talent, and quality oi swimming.” Ober-
miller said.

“We swam up to our capacity and imr
provement in times was fantastic. I cer
tainly can't find fault, because the meet
was closer than most people realize. There
were so many races decided by inches, and
they won't all go your way," Coach Ober—
miller added.

Proud that all Grinnell swimmers
scored, Obermlller was pleased with these
highlights:

Freshman Peyton Engel lowered his
time by 1:20 in his firstrplace 1650
freestyle. Senior Jim Redfern, off campus
first semester, came back to win both the

200 and 500 freestyles, Senior Tim
Brouillette scored a double in diving and
set records in both events despite a bad
back, Senior Bob Wandling swam and
scored in many events, and junior Tim
Laughinghouse touched out Lake Forest‘s
star, Tom Smith, in the 100 butterfly to set
school, pool, and conference records.

“Tim's last three dives were probably
the best ever seen in this pool." Obermlller
said, noting Brouillette's record-breaking
performances.

Looking into the future, Obermiller sees
”no more easy ones in the conference, and
that's the way it should be." Though both
Lake Forest and Grinnell lose outstanding
seniors, both have good talent returning,

Secondrplace winners for Grinnell were
Wandling in the 200 individual medley,
junior Kyle Torke in the so free, junior
Tom Welander in both the 100 and 200
backstroke. and freshman Darek Bushnaq
in the loo breaststroke.

Other Grinnell point winners were Scott
Patrick, Scott Potts and Jason Martin in
[M events; Martin Moon, Kevin Potts and
Jason Martin in IM events; Martin Moon,
Kevin Doerschug, John Williams. Paul
Froese, ~ Joe Lewis. Laughinghouse and
Welander in freestyle; Joel Shapiro in dive
ing; Patrick and Froese in butterfly; Mar~
tin and Doerschug in backstroke; and
Wandllng. Matt O'Hern and Ivan Lorkovic
in breaststroke,

sion Ill Nationals. held March 1921 in Cans

Torke in the 50 free, and Redfern in the 200
