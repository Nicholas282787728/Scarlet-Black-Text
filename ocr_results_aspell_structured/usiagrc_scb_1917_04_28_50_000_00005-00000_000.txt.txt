with one-third of the inter-class
baseball series completed, the Fresh-
men, conceded from the first to he the
darn horse aggregation, are far in the
lead, and according to several dopc-
sters, within earshot of the pennant.
A number or the players have already
signiiied their intentions of breaking
into the big timber within a short
time. The Juniors and Seniors, both
with several vets on the firing line,
have succeeded in breaking even, but
the Sophs have been unable to win
either game.

The game last night was the hard-
est fnught of any of the contests, the
Juniors, with the aid of two singles,
a passed ball and an error finally
landing on top or the Seniors by the
score of 675. If the game had pres
grossed much further the score would
undoubtedly have mounted into the
hundreds, for in the last few innings
each team acquired the habit of push-
ing two men across the plate. Osgood
was the batting hero of the contest,
being set back for strikeouts in each
of three trips to the box, and incident-
ally annexing an average for the day
of .000. "Ossy" was in right field
putting the shot when the game start-
ed, but was conscripted into_action
when it was round that the 'ISerS had
only eight men on the squad. He is
the only man who ever played a base-
ball game in Gl'illnell in a track suit.
Only seven hits were rcgistercd on
both pitchers, Macy yielding four and
Watt three. The batteries were: Sen—
iois, Macy and swan;
Wires.

Thursday's game resulted in a 473
victory for the Freshmen over the
Sophomores. Mungel‘ set the litters
down with two singles, both, how»
ever, ﬁghting in the run column, with
the aid of two wild pitches and a
stolen base. The pitching for the sec-
ond year men was divided between
Schultz and Agnew, with Stock on
the receiving line. Wednesday after-
noon's game was won by- the Seniors,
who handed the Sophs a 5-4 beadng,
barely nosing them out in the last
few innings of play. Schultz and
Macy pitched.

wood is a Piceoxlln. It is probably
related to Picea Alba, a species of
spruce long ago extinct in Iowa. This
species of woutl is found in the United
states on the coast of Maine, through
northern Vermont and westward
through northern Michigan and Min-
nesota, and the Black Hills of Da-
kota, whole it is linnwn as the Black
Hills spruce. In Montana, along the
Rocky Mountains, it reaches its great-
est development along the streams
and the lakes of the Flathead region
at an elevation of 2,500J3,000 feet.
The Kansas intcrglaeial drift which
hold this interesting material from
the past, is estimated to be from ten
to forty thousand years old. This

knowledge of the unknown ages that
