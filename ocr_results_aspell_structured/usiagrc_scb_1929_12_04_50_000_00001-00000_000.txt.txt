Nine members of the 1929 Grin-
nell college football team are award-
ed places on the All-Missouri Valley
teams selected by the coaching staff
of the Pioneer school yesterday.
Drake follows with five, Washington
has four, and Creighton and the 0k-
lahoma Aggies each get two places.
On the first eleven, Grinneil placed
five men, Drake three, and the other
sch'ools one each. .

In selecting an all-conference
team it is no easy matter to pick the
best men and have all the fans satis-
fied, but in one’ instance at least,
there was no such problem. The fu -
back position is awarded without
question to Harold Rose, Pioneer cap»
tain. Rose is everything that a
coach can ask for in a fullback. He
has the drive on smashes, the blocke
ing ability for running interference,
and is one of the finest defensive
backs seen this season. Rose is
selected as captain of the mythical
eleven for he has the fighting spirit
and could put the necessary drive his
to his mates.

Halfbacks Powerful

The half-back jobs go to Ruff of
Grinnell and Nesbltt of Drake. Who
are both equipped with the power
and drive to out any line from end to
end. In addition they are good kickT
ers and Ruff is an exceptionally fine
passer. His placekieks have helped
Grinnell to victory on more than one
occasion, King of Drake is one of
the nicest ballrtoters in the middle
West and the quarterback job is put
on his shoulders, although McIntire
of Grinnell is not far behind him.
King shows up exceptionally well in
the open field, and has a sidestep
that bothers tacklers.

The end positions go to Somers of
Creighton and Wensel of Drake, a
fine pair of wingmen that have made
a good record this year. These men
are fast in getting down under punts,
and are hard, sure tacklers. Somers
is also at punter of no mean ability.

Grinnell Rates Tackles

It is not often that one finds two
men from the same school taking the
tackle positions as _ is a hard prob-
lem to develop a man for each side
of the line that will rank with the
best. Humphrey and Walker of Grin—
nell are exceptions to this rule, howA

Truesdale Looks for Good
Season, With Wealth
of Material.

After weeks of short workouts for
basketball men not on the gridiron
squad, Coach J. c. Truesdale set out
in earnest Tuesday to round out a
squad capable of coping with the
Marquette quintet here in the opens,
ing contest Dec. 14. Regarding the
cage prospects Coach Truesdale
would make only one statement. "We‘
have more good prospects this year,
than ever before. with keener com-
petition for positions. it should mean
a better outcome. We have a dozen-
good men, many of whom are handle
capped by lack of height and l'each.‘;
however,"

Ruff. Douglas. Humphrey and Min—l
ier, all lettermen, reported for the
first time Tuesday, having been list-
ed among the gridmen earlier in the
season. Captain Wilhelm is the only
veteran who has been working out:
regularly prior to this time. Sopho-
mores on the squad who have pre-‘
viously been working with the grid—
ders are Christofferson, Edmans,‘
and Murphy. Murray and McCreary
are other sophomores expected to be
on the starring end of the game this
season.

Several men are out who have had
experience in games but have not
won letters. They are Schmaedecke,‘
Bob and Chuck Delong, Corrough
and Scott.

The Marquette game will be the
only contest here before the Christ-
mas holidays. The cagers will meet
the University of Minnesota at Min-,
neztpolis Jan. 4 and will then return
here to tackle St. Louis university

‘Natives Scared Away Crocodiles As We

By George Cuslinmn

“Methods of travel vary greatly

Osgood, noted scientific explorer in
response to an inquiry concerning
methods of travel in primitive coun-
tries at the present time. “In South
American countries much travel is
carried on by boats and canoes in
streams and rivers; in Asia small
wagons can often be depended upon;
but in Africa for the most part,
travel is dependent upon pack horses,
mules, and natives."

In Abyssinia. the site of his most
recent exploration, the zoologist said
that strong natives did the most help
with transporting the loads. Often
they carried heavy loads of fifty, sevA

”Probably the greatest problem
that is met by such an expedition as

the natives swim carrying the load,
