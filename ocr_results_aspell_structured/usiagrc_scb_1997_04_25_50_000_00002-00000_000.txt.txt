2 ARTS & ENTERTQMME Scarlet 8: Black Friday April 25 1997
Up-and—coming folk star Dar

Williams plays tonight

KURT ORZECK
Arts Co-Editor

Labeled “the preeminent voice in
twenty»something folk" by some
critics, Dar Williams graces
Grinnell tonight at 9pm in Harris.
Already her performance has drawn
much attention, as the rarelyvused
ticketing system at Grinnell has
been installed for the concert. The
only other time the ticketing system
has been in effect this year was for
the Herbie Hancock performance.

Williams grew up in rural west—
ern Massachusetts and entered into
the music scene with her 1995 de—
but, The Honesty Roam. She even
put together one of her tracks,
“Cool." in rural Massachusetts.
Recorded on her bed, she mufﬂed
out the sounds of neighborhood pets
by attaching clothing to her apart,
merit walls.

The HonestyRoom brought Will—
iams instant success. Though she
originally released the album on her
own, she 'later leased it to a small
Chicago-area label, Waterbug, and
finally to Razor tic Tie Records.

More recently, Williams released
Mortal City, her second album. This
time around, Williams was treated
to some professionalism in her re»

cording. Producer Steven Miller,
who also produced Suzanne Vega,
worked on Mortal City, Williams’s
latest album has sold an astonish»
ing 40,000 copies in its first six
months. according to Soundscan,
and Radio & Records selected More
Ial City as one of their Top 30 fa~
vorite albums,

Also, the music industry has ac-

“It is remarkable
how many things
28-year—old...

Williams can do
well, .. ” The Boston Globe

l
cepted Williams with utmost plea-
sure. Joan Baez picked Williams to
singaduetofone ofWilliams' songs
(“You’re Aging Well) on Baez’s
1995 release Ring Them Bells. Mu-
sicians,who back~up one-time rock
idol loan Osborne aided Williams
on the track “As Cool As lAm," off
Mortal City. Williams toured with
the Indigo Girls at the end of last
year, and joined Joan Baez for a six-
week national tour.

Critics seem to love Williams, as
well as other music artists. Spin
commented, “Regardless of niche,
good singer/songwriters know how
to tell a story, write a chorus, and
keep the habits oflheir late lover to
themselves. As younger ones go,
Dar Williams is perhaps the most
promising." “Williams does with
words what the Velvet Underground
did with musical form," claims the
Minneapolis City Pages, and The
New York Time: state, “She has the
craft and heart to make the folky
basics ring true again...(H)er songs
reach beyond modest ambitions;
they glow with compassion and in-
telligence."

Without doubt, her achievements
provide evidence for the critics'
praise. Williams has appeared on
the biggest music charts as of late:
Americana, CMI's Top 200, and the
FMQB. A twentyvminute feature
about Williams was shown on
NPR's “Weekend Edition.“

Williams is not one to be over-
looked. And with claims like, “Wil-
liams’ style might be described as
Ani DiFranco meets Alanis
Morisette." Williams' visit to
Grinnell tonight should not be
missed. Tickets will be available at
the door with a Grinnell College ID.

 

“The Head” Speaks about
Annual Short Film Festival

LINDSAY HAGY
Staff Writer
Today marks the last day for
Grinnell studean to submit their en-
tries into the colleges annual short
ﬁlm contest and festival Titular Head.
These films must not be longer than

seven minutes and will be viewed by L‘

the Grinnell campus commurtity and
a panel of judges on Friday May 2 at
9:30pm in the Harris Concert Hall.
Doors will open at 9pm. This year's
head of Titular Head, or “the Head”
as -he_calls‘it for short, is Senior Matt
iTll‘QﬂghrﬁﬂzlnhﬂMli‘nWtMlL

Saiia, I was able to gain a more com-
prehensive understanding of this lra~
dition at Grinnell.

—When did
the tradition
of rituinr
Head begin?

As far as I
know, it
started in,the
sixties or sev-
enties. It died
out when re»
lays died out »
the two used
to be con-
nected. Four or ﬁve years ago, Titu-
lar Head was resurrected from the
dead. ‘ , ‘

-How did you become the leader of
Titulnr Head, and who will be tak-
ing over next year?

Each year the responsibility is
passed down. Iwas chosen by Eleanor
Dodson, who was selected by Bill
Wells and so on. This year my side-
kick is Aaron Dale and next year he
will take over. In the grand tradition
of "III-1., each year, at about this time,
the successor of the head picks his/
her successo . So Aaron should be see
lecting his successor soon.
~What is Titular head exactly?

The Head, as I like to call it, is one
ofthe' most prestigious honors which
someone can receive here at Grinnell.

It is a recognition foi‘ creativity, inge—‘

nuity, and all thoselhings that go into
being a great person: It‘s an award

Destination: Al 0

, {Each year we tend to
get themes—last year it
was urination Hope—
fully, we’ll avoid bodily

functions this year.”
‘ , eMatl “The Head" Saiia ’97

given to the best student film here on
campus, The cream of the crop does
seem to ﬂoat to the surface. However,
this is not really about winning; it‘s
an open forum for freedom of expres—
sion.

—Is there a prize?

Absolutely. Not only does the win-
ner receive the warm and heart»felt
applause and respect of the commu-
nity, but she/he can also walk away
with her/his very own genuine, faux
replica of the essence of the original
'l'itular Head. Each one of these tro-
phies is hand crafted by,members of
a foreign country and looks great on
your mantle.

—How is the winner decided upon?

In order to
select the
winner, we
have a panel
of distin»
g u i s h e d
j u d g e s ,
w h o s e
names are
withheld for
the time be-
ing so that
bribery and
other forms of tampering can be
avoided. The films are usually judged
on the basis of artistic merit, enter-
tainment value, color contrast, preci-
sion editing, sound quality, best
dressed, cool special eﬁects, political
and social relevancy, length, smell,
and an assortment of other qualiﬁca—
tions.

—What variety of ﬁlms are submit-
ted?

Each year we tend to get themes _,
last year it was urination and the year
prior to that it was defecation. Hope-
,fully, We’ll avotd bodily functions this
year. People do what strikes their in-
terest, whether it is a flying-phallus

' or a killer squirrels. But I must stress

that all entries are maintain the high-
est standard of artistic integrity.
What is the fomtat for the viewing?
Once again we will be screening the
films with the delightful warm-up

Sean McGinty

show and running commentary of the
M.C.s of the evening, I was unable to
hire dancing beats for this year’s
event, but fortunately Katix Crawford
and Rachale Green kindly allowed
themselves to be persuaded to act as
the M.C.s. They’ve been working dili-
gently in the off season to prepare for
this event. There are some minors
ﬂoating around as to what they will
do, but I’m not going to speculate --
although I have heard promising ru»
mors of some type of acrobatic act.
—Whatis the general reaction of the
audience?

Mass hysteria. Also, to uphold the
family atmosphere that surrounds
Titular Head. we will only be serving
soda refreshments. Those who plan on
attending should use this information
wisely and come prepared.

—Arc any entries not shown at the
festival?

We pride ourselves on freedom of
speech. There is no censorship besides
the conscious of the director of the
ﬁlm. The black sheep in the closet of
the Head is that there was a gong sys-
tem at one point. This is shameful. I
vow never to let that happen again and
Aaron also feels strongly about the
permanent banishment of the gong
system.

—What can we expect from this
year’s entries?

Well, Kevin Rich has won for the
last two years in a row. After a bn'ef
period of stress-induced panic based
on the pressures of success Kevin has
once again put together what should
be a strong film. As far as contenders
are concerned, there is astrong show-
in g from several feisty underclass-
men. One competitor has spent over
100 hours slaving in front of the reel-
slicer. But as I said earlier. this is not
about the competition, but rather the
pride of artistic expression.

In the friendly spirit of Tltular Head,
Saiia would like to “wish everybody
happy headingrAnd I‘ll see you at the
main event." Those wishing to inquire
about last rriinute entn'es should VAX
[Saiia].

Dar Williams strums her guitar and exercises her vocal chords tonight at Harris. 9:00pm
