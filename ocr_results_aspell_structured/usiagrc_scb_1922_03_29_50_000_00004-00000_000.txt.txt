After having been presented by the
faculty, once refused by the stu—
dents and ﬁnally accepted on the rec-
ommendation of various Gl-innell ul—
umni associations, a bill was passed
and attendance at Grinnell Wreck

Ours has ﬁnally been made compulsory,

to all students in the liberal arts Lle-
partment of the college. The bill was
presented as a result or complaints
concerning the impracticability of 0p»
ening a. building for the\I'l'eck party
ty for the few people who attended,
and those few coming without dates
made it impossible to carry out the
preconceived plan of salvage.

A committee has been at Work and
the resolution as finally adopted Is as
follows:

Whereas, we consider the college
Wreck Our essential to the life of the
college and a worthy tradition to maln~
thin and

Whereas, we feel that there is a lack
of cooperation among the students in
carrying out the plans for informal
dances, and

Whereas, it has become necessary
to take some drastic measure to he
sure the life of the aforesaid Wreck
Our;

Therefore be it resolved,

That every student of the college
liberal arts department, unless speci-
ally excused by physician's excuse or
by merit of carrying at least two-thirds
A grade work, will be expected to at-
tend the various functions glven un<
der the auspices of the recreational
committee.

A maximum number of three cuts
shnll be ﬁxed for the school year. a.
ﬁne of one dollar each being charged
for every cut over this number, this
ﬁne to be paid before the student shall
receive his grades.

Music students are not considered
in the bill.

The reenmlneudalion was heartily
endorsed by all the alumni nsoctatlons
to whom it was presented. The only
disapproval came from a group of
students who under the leadership or .
‘Luclle Quinn, Lucille Keptord, and
Samantha Jones organized some quite
'tclllng agitation against the move-
lment. ‘

The recommendation was passed at.
In mass meetlng or all students only
alter the third ballot was taken. It is
Ihopcd that it will meet the present
need and remedy the unpopulated state
of the gym floor at Wreck Ours.
