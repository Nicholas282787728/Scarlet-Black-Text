REAL PEADE NEARER

YEARS SAYS BAILEY

Political Science Professor Dis-
cusses Offers Made by
Both Sides

‘I
PEACE, GREAT CAMPAIGN,
‘ 0R WAR TO EXHAUSTION

Present Situation Resolves Itself
Into These Three '
ternatives

That a real peace, with justice and
durability, is near-er‘uow than at any
time within the past iorty years. Pro-
fessor W. L. Bailey emphasized in F‘l'i-
day chapel.

1-ie pointed out thl‘ee‘posslbilltles—
honorable and victorious peace for the
allies; a situation which will develop
soon with crucial blows on both sides;
or a war to exhaustion.

Situation Is Crucial

"The situation is more crucial and
signiﬁcant than at any time within the
past three years." he said. "The two
groups are met in deadly contlict. and
are measuring each other’s strength
and ideals.” He added that peace. if
it came at all, would probably come
within the next three months.

“l-ias Gcrmany lost?" he asked. “She
has lost today because her goal on the
southeastern front has been taken
from her; because her territorial acs
duisitioiis are worthless to her. Ger—
many shows signs of being a didcrent
Ger-marry. lf peace is made at all. it
will be only with the representative
government or Germany."

. Peirce With victory

. “It peace comes at the present time.
t would mean peace with victory for
us," he declared. "We have won‘sub-
stantial victory, moral‘ and economic.
certainly, and even to a great extent
from the military point or view.

“Both our gene at and particular
aims have been real ed. Giving Russ
sia a chance, and pro ng that German
illegality cannot succeed are two
achievements this war has brought
about.

Safe for Democracy

"The world has been made safe for
democracy. it was safe in 1914. ex»
cept against atrocities. Any success
that Germany has had has been due to
atrocities. Now democracy has won.
even in a military way. over Gel-A
,inany's illegal and immoral methods.
We have made ourselves prepared even
against illegitimate danger.

"The prospect for an early peace
ought to hasten mobilization. We must
look for a durable not an eternal
peace. looking toward me organization
of nations." he said in conclusion.

Prof. Spencer Has Ancient Coin—
Unearthed 13 Feet Below
Unbroken Prairie

liow a Roman coin of the second or
third century licferc Christ camc to be
lying thirteen feet below the surface
of the unbroken Nebraska prairie is
the question which Professor E. B. T.
Spencer is now trying to solve.

The coin was found at Wilcox, Neh.
during the process 01 excavation for
the foundation of a silo and was sent
to Prof. Spencer by Ruth Beitei ’16.

is it l'erplexiug Question

The question of how and when this
piece of Roman treasure found its way
half way around the world to the mill-
dle western plains of North America
is open for lull and free speculation.
Professor Spencer, after a careful
study of the circumstances. has evolv~
ed a theory which he intends to incor—
porate in a magazine article which he
will write concerning the episode.
thn this is published depends upon
the time necessary to complete certain
inves 'gations which he is now con-
ducting. and in the meantime he pl'er
fer: to keep the secret to himsell.

It has been rumored that a similar-
Roman coin was unearthed several
years ago in South Dakota. Professor
Spencer can iind out nothing dedoite
in regard to the matter and is very ties
sirens or obtaining any information
about it.

Is Well Preserved

The coin is in a good state of pros-
ervation. it is made of copper and is
the size of a half dollar, but pinch
thinncr. A small hole is punched at.
the top. On one side is represented
the head of Mercury wearing his
winged helmet, and on the other a man
in a [olll‘~llorse chariot or quadrlga.
Beneath the chariot a- inscribed the
words “Roma" and “Mlnllc‘r”. The
last. according to Professor Spencer.
is the name or a Roman patrician [Emir
ily and the coin is known as a family
coin. The actual money value of the
piece was about equivalent to one cent
and its present value is vcr little
more. as this family of coins quite
plentiful.

The coin i now being photographed
and when it is returned in a few days
Professor Spencer will be glad to put
it on crbilntion for all who want lo
see It.

“Chuck" i-io ' whose fainc as a

ful in the 100»yal'd and 22o»yard dashes
and the high and low hurdles. but
without a doubt the 22o-yard dash was
his best race. In this raee he estab-
lished a world's record for a curved
track a year ago last April. at the
Drake Relays. He was pitted against
the best 2ZD-yard men in the country.
chcemly he was giveno place on the
All-American track team.

Cuptuin for Two Years

While ”Chuck" was on the Grinnell
track team the local college made a
very deeidcd advance in track athlet-
ics. For two successive years he was
track captai and it is needless to say
that his los to the team the coming
season will be a severe blow. as he
has always been the biggest point—win-

GARLETDN HERE FOR

SCARLET QUINTET IS IN
SHAPE FOR FIRST BATTLE

Local Line-Up Uncertain—Mike
Will Start at ‘Center
Position

\Vith only two experienced men 011
lhe squad, the Gl‘lnncll basketball '
team Will Stage its ﬁrst battle of the
season at the men's gymnasium [0-
night. when it meets the team from
Carleton,

Although little is known of the
strength at the northern culleglans,
there is no doubt that they \Vlll at»
tempt to duplicate their victory of two
years ago and avenge the defeat suf—
fered at. the hands of Gl‘innell last
Year. the ﬁrst one on their home ﬂoor
in several seasons. it is assured, howv
ever. that the visitors will place a team
on the floor which will give the locals
a tight battle and force 001' quintet
to the limit in order to Win.

Linc-Up Not Settled

It is not certain who will start the
game for Gl‘innell, but the team will
undoubtedly be picked trom the fol-
Iowillg men: Capt. Augustine. Ham-
mond, Wassenaar, Gass, H. Dauben—
bcr-ger. Dickerson, Garner, D. Macy.
Dimit and Sauel‘man. Regardless of
the lineup at the start of the game, it
is likely mat several substitutes will
be made before the ﬁnal whistle blows
in order to give as many men as 11054
sible an oportunity to display their
ability in an intercollegiate contest.

The entire squad is in good shape
physically, as the men have come thru
the week o(._practice without. injury.
The coach has been Scl'imlnaging the
men against the strong freshmen team
in the attempt to polish the work of
the varsity. Signal practice is also
forming at considerable part of each
afternoon’s pracﬁce.

Somers May Play

The loss of Somel‘s at guard will
weaken the team somewhat as he and
Capt, Augustine are the only experi-
enced men on the squad around whom
the coach has built his team. Somers
may be in the game, however; as he
is [0 be given a Chance to remove his
“con” this afternoon. it he succeeds.
the local stock will move up several
notches.

Although the outcome of the game
will furnish no basis for comparing
state teams, iL \l‘lll give followers of
the Grinnell ﬁve all ophol'tlllll lo
Lox-m some idea its to the possib lties
0f the local aggregation In later games
which have a bearing on the stale
