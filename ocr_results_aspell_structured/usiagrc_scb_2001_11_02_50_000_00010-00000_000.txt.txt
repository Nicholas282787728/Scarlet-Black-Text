Movie dilemmas

Hey wanna rec a more ronig/arzlr seems like an irrriocenr enough
qucsrionia good idea on a nighr when you're roo rired so do any.
rhing else, or you could go our ro dinner heroic hand and make ii a
dare The problem wirlr rlris ouession lies in wlrar irivarrahly follows:
sure, iooerrdoyoia wanna sees/or pirno open, 10/711: do you want ro roe.)
And (here’s your prohlern_deeidirrg on a movie.

How many hours have i sponr wandering around a video sroie
going, “How ahour ihis one?" ”No, I’ve seeir ir/ So-zlndem hared .r/
You’re kidding me, right? You aerually wanr so see that? How ahoui
rhis one?" “No, l've seen ii..." Repear ahour rwenoy rimes urriil you
are hour so rundown hy rhe process rhar you yusr gee someone’s “all-
iime ravorire movie” which means you keep warehiirg ihe same rwo
or rhree movies over and over and over agar

I have a elue for
you: ihe “Dru: Movie
of ihe season" is a
chickeﬂick rhar hoys
don'r wane re se. The
“Adrenzllne Rush of
ihe Season" is a kung.
in ﬁery explosion rhar
girls don't wane ro see.
Thor's ihe only clue I
have for you and ids
nor even a good one.
heeause ir's based on
gender siereorypcs.

There is a grain ofuudl rhere, rhough. W/Im Harry Met sally is a
prerry hasic “dale movie." hue when I asked my dare ahour ir, he iusi
made ihe universal sign orwanking. ofeourse, my liar mare and her
boyfriend wens ro see scream-prey beause he rhoughr is was a grear
“dare movie" and her oornmenr was, “It was so pmdicrzblFrwo
people meer in Bloomingdale’s over gloves and ofeoirvre rhey have ro
go our for ice cream and corroor/yshey’re desrined ro he rogerher and
obviorozy rhey will m-ﬁnd each orher a week after rhey marry orher
people."

There are no deuvcut “dare movies." When I was in high school,
Braveoeorrwas she ulrimare in “date movies," because is involved a
half-naked Mel Cihson (For rhe girls) killing lois or people in various
hloody ways (for she hoys) her he did is all for love (back ro ihe girls).
Also. is‘s long. so you oorrld makeour for a longer period of rime.
But now, whereas I srill like ii, a spor survey showed mosr people
rejecred rhe suggesrion.

Whar so do? Whar ro do? Comedies rhar do nor rely on love as a
eeniral rheme are good. They’re neurral~d1ey don’t reach lessons on
rlre way love and relasionships should he, and rhey don't have siigmas
orheing chickeilicks or shoor:emaup rypes. or. iry so had movies
rhar relare so your classes and pass rhcm oeas “edurarional.” lryou
and yourdare horh rake spanish, renr somerhing in Spanish. liyou're
both in Chinese Hisrory, rry The [All Emperor or Cmnlhr'rlg Tlgzr;
Hidden Dragon. iryoulre horh Hisrory 101 anyshing involving Nazis
would work, including Sound ofMerie, Toe poodiom, Cub/1m, or
even srorodkr-r Liar,

Another oprion of course is ro go see a movie. Ifyou sray in
Grrrrnell, ihere are only one or rwo movies in ihe rhearre ro choose
From, and only rive movies on mmpusilimiting your choices (one
siderahly, iryou ssill ean'r decide, pick she herrer showrime. Sadly,
sr/eaee ofrke Leonor is playing rhis weekend and someone rold me
rhis was she ulrimare dsre movie. His girlfriend does nor agree, Mayhe
rheyshould iusr go sccAnel Godwin play as Bob's on sarurday nighr
ar 10 rnsread.

Come les that do not rely on
love as a central theme are
good. They’re neutral—they
don’t teach lessons on the
way love and relationships
should be, and they don’t
have stigmas of being chicks
flicks ofshoot-’em-up types.

They know rhar ihe reirorisi aiiacks eonrinue ro rhis day and will

herween ihe rerrorisrs and rlie us, is nor a dirrerence ordegree The

porrers are evil and wholly desiruerivc. People undersrand shas no

is an unpleasanr rhing and unforiunaroly innoccnr people will die Un-
like Grinnellians, however. people also undersiand ihar ieriorisrs arm ro
maximize civilian dearhs, and rhe u.s mes so avoid unnecessary civilian
deashs. People undersrand rhar rhe rerroiisis will siop ar norhing include

ahour more rhan hin Laden, it’s ahour our naiional securiry. People un»
dersrand ihar a nuclear assaek no longer seems like a ianrasy. No one is
saying ihas war is a good rhiirg. hur in ihe end, hghring and winning rhis
war will save lives.

To many on rhis campus, ihe peace rallies are just rhe proresi orihe
