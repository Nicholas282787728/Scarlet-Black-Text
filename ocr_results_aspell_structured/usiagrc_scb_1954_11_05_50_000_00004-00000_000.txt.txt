i imagine that some of you
may have shuddered slightly at
the word “intellectual" in my
title. For alll know “intellect-
ual" may be another lost word
like “convocation." one we shall
have to forget for a few centur.
les until it regains its freshness.

l was so keenly aware of
your prejudice against thisword
that l thought of hiding behind
some such title as “The Cow.
the Altar and the Alarm Cloc
but then I remembered that
Emerson said in the most fam-
ous of all Phi Beta Kappa ad-
dresses, “The American' Schole
ar,” “Free should the scholar be,
—free and brave. Free even to
the definition of freedom, ‘with-
out any hindrance that does not
arise out of his own constitu-
tion.” So i decided to go ahead
and be brave, come what might,
and actually announce in ad-
vance what i was going to talk
about, thus doing my small bit
by not knuckling under to the
anti-mteilectualism of the age.

I think we might define the
intellectual very simply as an
intelligent person who has
fallen in love with books and
ideas. But, of course, just what
that means is not so very
simple when you look at it
carefully. There is about as
much mystery in the way of a
man with a book as there is
in the way of A man with a
maid Why do we fall in love
with either?

i know no easy explanation,
it would seem to be a matter of

character, something outside the
realm of our conscious choice.
It would seem almost true that
marriages are made in heaven.
not that they are perfect but that
they are predestined, inevitable.

We .are what we are from all
the multitude of causes run-
ning back to the beginning of
the world and by all the forces
that have shaped us since our
birth, our parents and their at-
titudes and prejudices, our home
town, our schooling, our friends.
And all of these causes 1nd 'n-
fluences incline us toward one
person rather than toward an-
other person or at. least make
us susceptible to a certain type,

« even perhaps to a certain color
of hair’ and before we know it,
we are in love.

I do not think that truly
falling in love with books and
ideas is less of a mystery than
truly falling in love with a
member of the opposite sex.
Certainly, I feel that I run
into a mystery every time I
look into a new class. There
you all sit, not actually very
far apart in social background
or mental‘ ability, for the most
part, very nice people, people
'whose company I enjoy. But
only some of you (we all
know this) seem to be really
interested to the point of cf-
rection in anythlng we may
read together or say to each
other.

Most of you will make an
honest effort to read and think
with me and I am dedicated to
the proposition, as i am sure
you understand, that the exper-
ience of a liberal education is
one of the most valuable you
can have; at the least, the varic
ety of disciplines you have faced
will make you more adaptable
in a fast—changing world, what.
ever your profession, than the
mass-produced, vocationally
trained student, whose present
knowledge and skill may prove
more immediately useful.

But granting all this, I still
am troubled by the fact that
one person seemingly is able to
fall in love with ideas, with
books, while another student ac-
tually does not possess “intel-
lectudl interests and tastes."
Does it absolutely need to be so

in all cases?

l don't lol' . .noment suppose
that you car. lift yourself out
of the chain or cause and event;
we are all prisoners of the
reality within and without. but
i do suppose that more of you
at least might become intelleclc
uals. Doubtless we were all
careless in chosing our great-
grandparents: if we had only
had the wit there in the other
world before our birth. we could
have chosen an Adams here, an
Edwards there, and so come into
the world brighter, more inter-
ested, and a good deal more
handsome.

But it is too late now to do
anything about our inheri~
taboo; all we can hope to do
is to take advantage of our
opportunities, of our possibil-
ities in the chain of events in
which we find ourselves.
Neither you nor your teachers
can make you intellectual if
God and history planned
otherwise, ‘but what interests
me is why more of you do not
become intellectuals when
hoolu and idens are all around
you. The Grinnell class of
1354. would, i believe, have
revellcd in the opportunities
you people have.
or course. there may be high-
ly personal reasons why you
permit yourself no more than a
passing acquaintance or at most
a polite flirtation with intellect
ual matters. But I locate most
of your difficulties in the Zeit»
geist, the time spirit, the gem
eral drift of thoughtand feeling
in our time, and I think that if
you know the nature of the
trouble, you may be able to con.
quer it.

i may delude myself but I
suppose that you can unlock the
meaning of various ages with
key terms. For example, God or
religion seems to me the key
term to the seventeenth century;
reason, the key term to the
eighteenth century; nature or in-
dividualism (l have not quite
made up my mind on this), the
key term to the nineteenth cen-
tury. The key term to our
century seems to me society.

We no longer measure our
personal success as our seven-
teenth century ancestors did by
the inner state! of grace we be-
lieve we discern in ourselves,
nor by the prowess of our rea-
son, nuw that Freud has shown
us the determini.-g powcr in
our thought and action of real-
son’s opposite. the unconsicous.
And we no longer measure suc-
cess as Wordsworth and Thoreau
did by the harmony we think we
find between our moods and
those of nature,

We know how successful we
are, NOT by the look of our-
selves in introspection but by
the look on other people's

faces. A slight look of cone
tempt is usually enough to
tell us that we have failed.
The forced smile tor-approval,
genuine admiration: these are
the looks that count. These are
succes.

Or try it another way. The
standard of our actions is no
longer what we as individuals
feel is right or what our Bible
or our church tells us is right.
We lend—the Kinsey Reports
are Exhibit A and Exhibit B—
to find our morality in statistics.
1: is what the mass of men do
and think and feel. what they
permit themselves, that is right.
Wrong or eccentric is what most
people do not do.

Of course, there‘ are good his-
torical reasons why we now
yield to the herd instinct and
the herd standard as never be-
fore in history: urbanization
which has piled us pellmell in
each other's way in larger and
larger cities; the automobile,
airplane, the radio, and televi-
sion which have resulted in the
awful closeness of everybody to
everybody and everything; most
of all, the thred‘. of total do»
struction which has inevitably
convinced us that we must hang

together, plan together, if we
are to havr any chance of fu-
ture individual existence.

And it is not really surpriSA
ing that a fine liberal arts
college tucked into a little
country trwn in the Middle
West should share the spirit
of the age and exaggerat
place or organized act
and associations for this, asso-
clatimls for that.

We but do in the small what
the world is doing in the large.
which as we learn daily via
newspaper, radio and television
in one long round of commit»
tees, usually with Mr. Dulles
ilying in at the last moment.

And liere’T think is the ex-
planation of why so many of
you who might, do not fall in
love with hooks and ideas,
why you do not become intel-
lectuals. To build a community
such as Grinnell College, we
must of course participate in
matters of general interest;
but as in‘ all love affairs, so
in what I have called the way
of a man with a book, there
must be some solitude, some
aloneness, some privacy if ate
faction is really to flourish.

in classes or colloquia or cof-
fee hours. the seeds of intel-
lectual interest and taste my
be sown but intellectual inter-
ests need much private water.
ing, much private cultivation if
they are to amount to anything,
and the whole spirit of the age
carries us away from privacy,
individualism, and refinement.

Ask yourself, for example.
when you last did something by
yourself which was your own
individual concern. when did
you last take a walk by your.
self and think of where you are
and what you are making of
college and yourself?

When did you last read a
book that wasn‘t assigned
.simply because you were in-
terested in reading it? Have
you a hobby? Have you a col-
lection of some kind? Do you
keep a notebook or your
thoughts, or for that matter
(and I do not mean it un-
kindly) do you have any
thoughts of your own to keep?

Some of you have told me
that you can not bear to be
alone more than fifteen or
twenty minutes during your
waking hours. Of course, you
were trying to shock me, but I
believe you were still stating a
truth, a very disturbing truth
about yourselves and our gen-
eration. Everything these clays is
group activity, group fulfillment,
activities, mass activities. This is
indeed the age of the'mass man.

lint let us suppose that you
allow time and privacy for
water to gather in your lnv
dividual wells, nut you do not
run off to tell someone when
you feel the least moisture of
an idea, and that having be-
come somewhat a lover of
books and ideas you now have
prejudices enough to make you
interesting company.

Do you dare to do much, if
anything, about your new pri—
vate life of affection and imag-
inatian? I think that here again
the Zeitgeist, the spirit of the
age, proves an almost fatal dis»
couragement to many potential
intellectuals.

If we choose to believe the
noise coming out of Washington
these days, “Intellectual” is sim—
ply another way of saying sub-
vel'sive or at least potential
traitor, or if not some variety of
traitor. some variety of fool.
“intellectual" and "egg-head"
are interchangeable terms in
some, as I believe, NOT Very
select circles.

And the difficulty is that
there would seem 10 be some
conﬁrmation of the charges.
Who can deny in view ol the
facts that we have been be-
trayed by some of our intel-
lectuals, Alger Kiss, Whittaker
Chambers, Elizabeth Bentley,
William Remington, an that

old rightest, he of the many
impenetrable cantoes, Ezra
Pound, who broadcast for
Mussolini and Fascism uni-mg
World War ll?

We should not forget rucse
infamous intellectuals in any
mediation on being an intellect-
ual, for they have done more
than all the haters and dis-
trusters of ideas from Wisconsin
and elsewhere to discredit the
intellectual life and to make you
and other students like you shy
away from noticeable involve-
ment with books and ideals.

I know your unspoken argu-
ment: you do not w‘uh to
identlry yourselves with trait.-
ors and fools; furthermore, you
must earn a living; You can
not afford to identify your-
selves with a group so much
in disrespect with potential
employers, lictter to have a
very quiet interest in ideas.

But 1 hope for the good of
your generation and your
country that you will not give
up so easily. 1 do not mean to
suggest for a moment that Hiss,
Chambers, Bentley, Remington
and Pound were not intellectuals,
nor do I mean to suggest that
some or any of them were one
generously or unfairly found
guilty of betrayal.

i do not suppose that all in-
tellectuals must be saved tar
gether or they shall all be lost
together. We stand on safer
ground, i believe, if we agree
to call the intellectual an intel»
ligent man or woman who has
fallen in love with ideas—and
then hasten to add that this love,
like all other loves, may be wise
or foolish or even criminal. I
call the loves of ﬁns, Chambers,
Bently, Remington and Pound
both foolish and criminal.

But because these lovers of
the extreme idea were so
wrong and so dangerous I do
not think it follows that all
lovers of extreme ideas are
wrong. i am willing to go so
far as to believe tint some-
times the extremist is neces-
sary.

If we learn no other lesson
from the'period of our Civil
War, I think. We Should learn
that ideas are the springs of
evenls and that the answer to
the intellectual ianatically in
lave with destructive ideas is the
intellectual passionately in love
with constructive ideas; and
looking back I believe that it
was probably necessary to right
fire with fire, to balance an ex.
treme of reaction with an ex-
tremE of reform.

But if we study American
intellmtunl and Sp tual his-
tory, I think we shall discover
a significant difference be.
tween the abolitionisls and
those Communist and Fascist
intellectuals in whom I have
referred.

They were seeking to under-

mine the state through conspir—
acy with foreign powers; the
abolitionists were seeking to
fulfill the American dream
through openly and individually
declared war on what they re.
garded as the horrible injustices
of slavery and the dark inclina-
tion being given to American
life by the slave system.

Despite their disregard for
law, they were not enemies of
democracy and of the deeply
rooted moral and religious life
of America. They were arch-
democrats and the most influen.
tial of them were Puritans of
the old stamp I am proud to be
part of Grinnell College when I
remember that President Josiah
Bushnell Grinnell of lowa Col-
lege, as we called ourselves in
those days, helped John Brown
on his way east from Kansas
when he stopped in this town in
1859. '

I believe John Brown was
needed as symbol if American
democracy was to fight itself
out of the slavery and material-
ism which were strangling it.
i can imagine that in the com
ing years of the twentieth cen-
tury we may need extreme radi.
cals in the American grain like
the Beechers, the Parkers, the
Garrisons, the Browns and the
Grinnells. I hope you will learn
enough American history to
keep open the possibility that
the devoted and extreme inlelr
lectual may be of service to his
age and his country.

But if you will not go all
the way with me, let us agree
at least that a century ago we '
were preserved as a nation,
not by the anti-intellectuals,
the men of no ideas, but by
the greatest engaged intellect-
ual of the nineteenth century,

Abraham Limln. . . . . . . .
And I think we have reason
to suppose that the kind of per
sons who saved us and sustained
us in the past are the kind of
persons to whom we should look
in the future as our best hope.
l urge you to resist your age
even to the point of holding
hard and fast to the word “in
tellectual“ itself which is now
almost a swear word.

If you do not feel that you
can become an lutcllectual
yourself, at least admit the
probability that it is very im-
portant that many persons be-
come intellectuals.

There may seem little or no
connection between reading and
thinking quietly and independ—
ently here at Grinnell and the
large issues of the world, but
an examination of the facts will
prove, l believe, that just as we
found families in the privacy of
affections between inch and
women, so we prepare and sus-
tain nations in the privacy of
intellectual affections.

And as a last word let me
say again those lines from
Emerson's “The American
Scholar” with which I beg-an:
“Free should the scholar ile—
frec and brave. Free even to
the definition of freedom,
‘wltllout any hindrance that
does not Arise out of his own
constitution! "
