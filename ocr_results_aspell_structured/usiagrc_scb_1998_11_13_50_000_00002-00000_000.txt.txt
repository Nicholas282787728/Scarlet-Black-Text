Goodbye,

Newr is gone. can you believe it? 1m
srill shocked. According ro rhs ﬁery ame
phibian, he is rhevicrim ofeannibalism by
his own parry. Newspapers ralked ofhope
rhar his resignarion would satisfy rhe Ree
publicans' rhirsr for blood,

Gruesome sniff, isn'r it?

1r is hard ro ralk abour Gingrich's record
as Speaker wirhour rhe conversarion rurn.
ing gruesome. Under his leadership, rhe Re-
publican parry carried our an agenda rhar I
will polirely call “mean spirited." for ex:
ample, rhe latesr congress, rhe 105th, has
been called rhe mosr anri.environrnenral
Congress ofall rime. Dozens ofmidnighr
riders were slipped in to cur old growrh
foresrs, develop coasral marshes, and elimi-
nare environmenral impacr assessments for
grazing on federal lands, ro name a few.

Thar's only rhe beginning, rhough. rm
nor only ralking abour rlre environmenr
here. rm ralidng abourarracks on rhe poor,
arracks on rhc elderly, arracks on rhe arts,
arracks on immigranrs, arracks on women,
arracks on anybody wieh dark skin, and ar:
racks on homosexuals.

For as long as l live I will never forget

rhe rime rhar 1 opened die newspaper and ,

read an arricle about Newr Gingrich call»
ing for rhe rerminarion of rhe federal
School Lunch program. if rhere was one
rhing I droughr would be sacred to even
rhe Republicans, it was aid for school
lunches. Allowing children rhe opporruniey
ro ear food regardless of economic back—

ground seems fundarnenral to me. Consid-\

ering rhe small fraerion of rhe budger the
program consumes, I didn’t figure anyone
would be evil enough or srupid enough ro
rake it away. 1 underesrimared Newr and
rhe gang.

N eW‘I' EY' TOR ANSON

lsar rlrere reading abour Ncwr, bur l felr
like he was reaching his hands down my
rhroar to rip our years offood from my body.
I received reduced lunch prices ar school all
rhrough my elemenrary school years. Ar rhe
rime, 1 thouglrr rhe program worked thisWay:
rich kids paid me full price, normal kidslike
rne paid rhe reduced price, and poor kids gor
lunch free, Now I know rhar Congress and
she press believes rhar poor kids pay rhe re—
duced price and impoverished kids ger free
lunch. Wharever. its all relarivc. Ar my :1»
emenrary school we gor blue lunch cards wirh
numbers on rhern for each meal. The cards,
ifl remember correcriy all looked the same.
No onecould rell bylookipgar rhe card how
much anyone had paid for the meal. When
we wenr in line rhe lunch lady rook a hole
punch and punched our one number. After
kindergarren or maybe hrsr grade each kid
was in charge afhis/her own card. from rhar
poinr on, 1 lived in pcrperual fear of losing
my precious lunch card or sending it rhrough
rhe laundry machine. 1 rhink rhey were tryv
ing to reach us responsibiliry, bur it jusr
taught me to feel guilrywhenever 1 losr a card.
Despite the reduced price, 1 knew my lunch
card was expensive'ro replace. Once I lost a
card rhar had abour1o meals srill on ir and 1
cried for hours and didn’t rell my parenrs
about it for more rhan a week. For those days,
I didn’t ear lunch. Guess whae.>l couldn't con-
cenrraee in afrernoon class; l slepr in class; 1
was irrirable. ifskipping luneh ro save money
had been a regular habie, 1 know my aca»
demic performance would have been ncga»
rively impacted. Even wirh rhe school lunch
program, kids from poor families aren’t on
equal ground wids rheir more privileged class-
mates. Besides material shortcomings, rhey
face discriminarion from reachers who cxpecr

poor kids to foil. onetime during a par.
enr teacher conference, my mom told my
younger sisrcr's rcacher rhar my siblings
and I received rhe reduced lunch prices.
This reacher had me, my brorher and my
sisrcrin her class ar one time oi anorher.
She expressed shock and disbelief, saying.
"Eur Mts, lanson, your kids READ!”

Newr Gingrich see our ro make sure
rhat, indeed, poor kids wouldn't be able
ro read, wrirc or do marh. 1 car rhere and
read all abour it, Then 1 exercised my abil»

parenrly lore of orher people know how
to read and wrire because congress re.
ceived quire a few angry lerrcrs. president
Clinron seized on rhe opporruniry eo

lunch program. Gingrich backed off.

Now Gingrich is gone. Many of his
colleagues remain. so, we aﬂn’t safe yer.

low Republicans ATE him. I celebrared
by going ro Quad and caring lunch.

Proud vegans respond to

Dear Ms. Amanda Dcsimont,

We are vegans. We rake serious offense

Ms. Suzie Prircherr for mocking our fragile

You, Ms. DeSimonc, obscenely used rhe
