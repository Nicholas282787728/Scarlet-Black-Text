Fiscal responsibility
sorely lacking

$76,877 is a lot of money. That lot of money is SGA's
budget for this year. Is that money spent wisely? Is that
money publicly accounted for and supervised by SGA? We
think not, especially in light of the present revelation on the

Concerts Committee spending.

Students, who provide the bulk of the SGA budget
through their activities fees, have a right to be informed
about how that money is expended. SGA members have an
absolute duty to know about these finances. In talking to a
representative this week, we found that most of the
representatives were ignorant about SGA finances.

Hall representatives generally don’t know where the
money comes from, how much there is or who decides how to
spend it. But, yet, many said they considered the budget the
most or one of the most important functions of SGA,

A finance committee exists, but they haven't met yet this
year. Most of the members of this committee don’t know
what their duties are. The SGA constitution doesn‘t describe

them either.

Fiscal accountability and responsibility should begin with
the finance committee. The committee should demand
regular reports from people in charge of funds and present
these to the Joint Board. Regular investigation and
questioning of expenditures should be a primary duty of the
committee. To draw up the budget for each year is not
enough. They should be able to account for every cent of that
budget money throughout the year.

This situation is a discrediting comment on the type of
leadership we have in Joint Board. We know leadership has
reached ”rock bottom“ when hall representatives think it
unnecessary to show up or remain at Joint Board meetings.
The last four scheduled meetings couldn't begin or adjourned

early due to lack of quorum.

Tear down the pedestals

History teaches us that the sub“

by Katherine A. kramer

Betty Ford recently gave $50.00
to the ERAmerica fund.
ERAmei-ica was started by
prominent Women to raise money
for a pro~ERA lobby. When four
more states pass the amendment,
the Equal Rights Amendment will
become our 27th Amendment.
Unfortunately over the years the
prospect of passage has lessened.

Phyllis Schlaﬂy has been one of
the key forces behind the anti-ERA
movement. Espousing rhetoric
such as “Let us stay on our
pedestals,“ “Would you want your
daughter to be drafted?“ and “The
ERA would lead to public coed
restrooms," Schlafly has con-
vinced many women and
legislators that women benefit
from their “protected" position
under the law.

The positron i see women holding
under the law is supine, prostrate.
or prone. To answer Schlafly’s
rhetoric, I am tired of the View
from my pedestal, I can only look
down at society and am prohibited
from engaging in many of its

workings. i do not want to see my
daughter or my son drafted but i
feel they have equal responsibility
to the law if they receive the equal
benefits of the law. Finally, every
house has coed restrooms; the
Grinnell experience demonstrates
that humans can adjust to the
opposite sex occupying the next
stall, and realistically public coed
restrooms are not the Wave of the
future, '

To me the ERA functions as one
very simple battle in a long hard
war, I find it ironic that a group of
legislators feel they have the
power to declare women “equal"
and grant us basic human rights.
This omnipotenceon the part of the
malerdominated legislature only
reﬂects the control the government
tries to maintain over females in
all parts of our society.

But since I do not have equality
and rights (and if I will get them
under the ERA) I will most cer~
lainly accept this “gift” from the
government. Looking to the futurc,
the ERA cannot be all we expect
from our government and culture

fragettes put all their faith into
receiving the right to Vote. The
franchise was the major goal of
their feminism and the movement
lost its momentum after Amend-
ment 24 was ratified on August is,
1920.

Feminists of today must not rely
on a single constitutional amends
ment as the password to equality.
If the ERA passes. we must realize
that the amendment is not an end;
it is only a means toward the goal
of equality under the law, in our
jobs, and in our social Sphere.

Since most state legislative
sessions have begun, now is the
time to send telegrams, letters,
lobbyists, etc., to your state
representative, Some of the states
that defeated the amendment in
1975 are Illinois, Indiana, Virginia,
Louisiana, Utah, Georgia,
Oklahoma, Nevada, South
Carolina, North Carolina, and
Florida, A collection of material on
the ERA is on reserve in the
library for reference,

Election stimulates nausea

by Bob Rclidcr

Once again, the four year cycle
has begun anew. it is an election
year, and if you hadn't noticed, the
first presidential primary will take
place in New Hampshire February
24th Yes, my fellow Americans, it
is a time of great excitement,
speculation, hope, and for some,
including myself, a time of nausea.
These last few weeks I couldn’t
pick up a newspaper or magazine,
watch a newscast. or listen to thc
radio without hearing the latest
poll predictions and their imr
plications. We are told what color

Brig/9t moments

by Dan ilcxtei

If by some small chance you had
heard about it in advance, or if you
decided that the Loose Hall Ball
wasn’t your idea of a Saturday
night out in Grinnell, you might
have heard NET broadcast
Downbeatmagazine’s poll winners
for 1975.

The show was aired at midnight,
so obviously its producers felt that
a large audience would be able to
see and hear who'snwho in
American Jazz this year. No way.
I’m sure we could find out where
most Americans were Saturday
night at midnight. Anyway, a few
of us dedicated music appreciators
planted ourselves by the TV in the
hopes of seeing before our eyes a
somewhat accurate representation
of the artists who are catching the
public’s eyes and ears.

The show was hosted by two very
well known namesiQuincy Jones
and Chick Corea. Quincy has made
his mark through arranging and
through his own albums, Chick
through his participation in several
of Miles DaviS' ensembles and
through his band Return To
Forever. The artists who were part
of the entire affair included McCoy
Tyneripiano. Stanly Clarkei
acoustic and electric bass, Lonny
Whiteidi‘ums, Airto Morierai
percussion, Hubert Lawsiﬂutc,
George Benson—guitar. Sonny
Rollins and Rahsaan Roland Kirk
on tenor saxcs, Freddic Hubbard
on trumpet, and Bill Watrous on
trombone. No one could argue With
those assembled, they were the
besl in each of'thElr fields. But
what was ridiculous about the
Whole affair was that they (not
knowing who organized the affair,
I cannot'label ‘they'. with more

accuracy) attempted to portray
what is and who is responsible for
contemporary jazz in America in
1975. To this effort, the producers
and promoters fell right oliol their
studio chairs. Not only wer

artists not able to display ori

compositions with their own
respective ensembles, but they
were forced into collaborating with
each other on a few token
arrangements of tunes by Can-
nonball Addel‘ly and Duke
Ellington. Both of these late arlisls
made major contributions to the
development of jazz through its
numerous evolutions, but by no
means was this ‘lhemc’ necessary
to present the aforementioned
artists in a dignified manner

For over 70 years jazz has been
in existence, and for the past 40 it
has been available to any and
every American Who has been able
to penetrate the walls 0f sup-
pression which have surrounded
the artists and their lives for the
length of its existence. So after 70
years, or even the last 40, jazz
was lel out of its corner and put on
national TV, riitcen artists plus
the ensemble Weather Report were
unleashed into lhe studio for a
taping session which had no
prccedence and thus unlimited
ability to eloquently portray some
of the masters of our era.

What I saw came close to being a
commercial for Downbeat
Magazine, and further promotion
for the already monolithic careers
of Jones and Cored. NET did
nothing for the public awareness in
this area, it only allowed for fur
ther ridicule of the artists. There
they were. all on the screen,
smiling like they were having the

.greatest,time, and my spirit took a

dive as the minutes licked away
what will probably be thc only
program of this type, unless
“they" produce an identical one
next year. Or maybe the Nilson
poll will not permit the rec-
currence because of lack of
audience.
I can't figure out if that would be
a blcssing to the artists or If it
would be better to disappoint
themselves and their most ape
precialive audience which follows
them from city to city, year after
year. icannot decide whether the
worth of the appearance of each
artist counteracted What I felt Was
the needless degradation of what is
simply JAzz. Having a few hours
and a beer or two to resolve the
anger created by the whole affair,
the following night I was again
watching NET. What came on
around 8:30 (the edge of
primetime) was a guitar player
from southwest Texas, who had an
entire hour to strum, thump, and
belt out some original coma
positions
Now I don‘t know who decides
what, where and how things
happen on NET. Ican’l even figure
out how the commercially oriented
Midnight Special receives its
recognition, in consideration of the
loose and immature musical form
displaycd weekly. With no solution
to these issues immediately
available to myself and believers
nearby, I feel like closing with a
line the artist Sun Ra made into a
musical statement (addressed [oi
the organizers of the NET spccial‘
and all those who have their hand
in similar treatment of JAZZ):
“Why don't you make a mistake
and do something right for a

, change!”

suit the President wore, that
Ronald Reagan suffers from
sinusilus, and that Southerner
Jimmy Carter doesn’t mind the
cold of the Northeast.

1 am not implying that such an
event is not newsworthy. This
primary is of the utmost rm.
portance to those candidates who
need a boost, to raise funds, get
publicity, and even start the ball of
momentum towards their party's
nomination. Yes, this is the first
significant partisan choice of thc
year, where there is active par-
ticipation by the electorate, unlike
the caucuses here in Iowa and in
other states What drives me up the
wall is the excluswe coverage the
President gets, when all know too
well that he isn't going to say
anything profound, worth printing
or hearing, Each and every
candidate is asked if he thinks the
primary is important, when it is
obvious that it is. All these reports
say this is the most crucial
primary, that there can be only one
winner from each party. 1 think it
15 too early in the race to ex
frapolate such conclusions.
McGovern came on strong weeks
after New Hampshire in 1972. The
telling blows will be in the bigger,
populous states where efficient
organization and well planned
campaigning will decide the
ultimate victors.

The ironic thing about all this
media coverage is that only a
small percentage of the people of
this country know who the can
didates are and what they stand
for. I saw one report on the CBS
News last week that focused on
Senator Birch Bayh's chances in
New Hampshire. He walked into a
factory and started shaking hands,
saying, “I'll, rm Birch Bayh and
I’m running for President, I need
your help on the 24th." The worker
replied, “You‘re ruunning for
what?" Sergeant Shriver showed
up at an annual dogsled race, and
his appeal didn’t seem to extend

past man’s best friend, One of the‘

goals of news reporting should be
the intelligent coverage of these
events and encourage par-
ticipalion.

My example of media coveiagc‘

is just one of many that reveal the
blatant deficiencies in our
prcsidcnllal election process. It is
not a serious selection mechanism,
but a spectacle reduced even
further to a carnival. Too much
time and money is wasted, with Ihe
professional image makers, adr
vertisers, strategists and
television networks the sole
benefiClaries. The prospect of a
whole spring filled with electior,
reports, polls, TV ads, and
distraught newsmen does not sooth
my already shaky stomach.
