Fall and Winter Shoes

YOU are 'cordially invited, for your sake

as well as ours, to see the Fall and
Winter Florsheim Shoes which we, are
now showing. This famous shoe was never
better, never offered greater variety in good
. styles. Nor was there ever a time in shoe
history when it was more important for you
to be sure of what you are getting—sure that
every dollar you put into footwear is returned
to you in shoe merit, shoe value. The ’name
Florsheim is your guarantee of that. What!
ever the price, it is always low in comparison.
