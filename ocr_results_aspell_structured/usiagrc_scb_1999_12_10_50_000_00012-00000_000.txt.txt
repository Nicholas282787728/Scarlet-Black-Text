lth a grain of salt

Dear Salt,

got really drunk and
made out with this girl
who is in one of my
classes. How should I
act around her now?

Dear Embarrasscdi

well for ssnrsers, how abous saying “laello”> seriously, no masses
how you sreosed her before wolsr, wherher you swo were good ac.
suiainsances or ,uss plain-didn‘t recognize each osher's presence, you
ean's sreas her as rhough sbe doesu’r exiss now Acsually, you could,
bus I \vouldn’r recommend is. us eruel, and 1 know rrom personal
experience how hurrful shas can be, Whas you swo did, no masses if
is was she alcohol salking or your own hidden desires, happened,
end orssory. Ignoring she problem by ignoring her will neser change
wliar sook place or make an already awkward sisuasiou any besser l
suggess pulling hei aside and salking so her abour how you reel abous
whar happened liyou reel as sliougli is was a missake, roll her, folr
lowing wish an “I'm sorry irl led you on." She may be upser wish
you because she will fuel used by she .y you sreased hers ,uss as a
warning, bus renlue is is imporsans shas you be lioness abous your
reeliugs in whos lock place lfyou two elioose so be rriends, formal
acquainranees, or lovers is ensirely up so you and her; iuss make sure
you are as least cordial so her in she rurure,

Warch out who you hang wish when drunk,

Malaiko \Vlley

Dear Embarasscd.

How you should aer depends on how you feel abour lies and nbour
whar happened. lfyou shink you wanr a relasionship wish her, you
need so communiease slias so her. lryou would like so befriends wish
her, you need so conimunicase shas so her, soo. Even iryou wans her
so he an acquaintance, is mighs be good so be sure shas you are bosh
elear on rhas, even ifis means braving a conversatlon wish her.

lfyou ean's salk wish her and iuss wans so have a class wish her as
anonymously as possible, shen he respeesrul. say hello when you see
hcr. Always ways. This campus is far soo small (as you’ve round) so
be “nor speaking" wish anyone. Make is clear shas you respees her as
a fellow ssudens. Look as her when she speaks in class \Vhareyer
your reelings for her, she is a person and a fellow ssudens who you
once souclied, and she deseryes your respecs. Trying so ignore her
esissence will only make she embnrassmens worse and is disrespees—
fol.

You mighs wans so ayoid suoasions where you inighs do shings
shar embarrass you, You miglu also consider whesheryou use alcholiol
so avoid raking responsibilsy for doing whas you wans so do. lrso,
maybe you need so reconsider your values and whas you wans and
sake responsibiliry For your choices inssead ordepending on alshohol
so lower your inhibisions, and shen blaming drinking for your sisuaa
sion. Sax isn's wrong, irresponsible, disrespeesrul sex is wrong. And
if she bonds we rorm wish oshers, however fleesing, are forged wish
respoes and easing rhen rhere is no shame in shem,

Take care oryourself,
