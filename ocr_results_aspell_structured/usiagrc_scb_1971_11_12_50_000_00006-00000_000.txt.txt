Squatting next to the Science Buildr
ing in mid-campus is tound the
Women‘s Gymnasium, a round red
bastion that many people label the
otiicial Sore Thumb of the Grinneil
scene. At present its chief lunction
is to block some of the gusts of
wind that roll across campus on
winter mornings,

Iowa Enrollment

Irollincnt totals 100,598 this fall,
down 1,066, according to a report
compiled for the Associationoilowa
ICollcge and University Presidents.
I’ he total is 1.1% down lrom last

in 1970 over 1969 However, new
freshman enrollment is down by
6.5% from 1970. Last fall’s new
fireshman enrollment decreased
11.4% from 1969.

when Rand Gymnasium burned
down in 1897, the present structure

took its place as the Men’sGymnue
iuin, Later, in the 1940’s, Darby was

built and the women took over what
is now so ingeniously entitled the
Women’s Gymnasium.

The late oithe Women’s Gym is now
at stake. Many people would like to
see it torn down and replaced with
more “generous groupings oitrccs,

to 33,038. Freshman enrollment,

5,451 this iall, in private schools is
down by 4.9% (8,921 in 1970)

entire campus one ol the most at-
tractive in the Midwest.”

Other suggestions include makingii
into a daycare center, a theaterrinr

vironmental control center.

Another suggestion has been the
possibility of tearing the building
partway down and leaving the rest
as an artistic ruin.

Or how about turning it into Grine
neli’s first good restaurant? 0 a
roller derby arena? The possib
ties are infinite, If anyone is con-
cerned about the destiny of those
hallowed round walls, send sugges—
tions into the S&B.

Thornton Views Grinnell

by Ted Grippo and Scott Frankel

Mr. Virginius Thornton, black pron
lessor in the History and American
Studies departments, told the ShBin
an interview last week thatblack Stur
dents at Grinnell are deeply con—
cerned with admissions policies
here and the role blacks can play in
the college community,

As far as a Black Studies Course
here, he would like to see it, but
only it it is not “emascuialed” wiIh
controls imposedbyihosewhdelther
cannot appreciate the large measure
to which blacks have contributed to
the culture of the nation since 1619,
or by those whose upbringing and
education Causes them to be too
anxious to cling to the present perr
verted View of blacks and their
”place" in American history.

Black students are also concerned
with the relatively small number Of
black faculty and administrators
They leel that many whites, because
of their miseducation concerning
black culture, are either unwilling
or unable to delegate proper res-
pect to the efforts of sincere blacks
in the framework of black culture,

Also oi key importance is the re-
cruitment of black Students. As to
complaints that some blacks receive
preferential treatment in the ode
missions procedures, Mr. Thornton
explains that the traditional yardr
sticks used to measui'eallighrschool
students’ potciitialare in many cases
preferential to whites. He also mains
tains that there are many cases of
students both black and white who
did not, for one reason 01‘ another,
coniarm to nighrschool restrictions
but went on to be very siiccessiul in
College and graduate school, He feels
strongly the need to alter the yardr
slicks themselves,

Mr. Thornton supports a recently
expressed view that Grihhell is very
“white” and went on to say Ihatil is
even somewhat of a “middIErclass

Yes, You Do
Have A Voice!

The press release which the SM}
received last week li-om Selective
Service explaining changes in the
draft regulations was oi more than
usual interest Atler noting that the
regulations havealrcadybecii signed
into law and would soon go into
eitect, it said interested persons
could submit their views on the new
regulations to the Selective Service
System in writing lictore 'the el-
iective date That's inputl

Mr. Thornton pauses on Central

Mecca”, He would very much like
to see the Grinnell experience
broadened and thereby made more
realistic by an increase in the numr
her olblack students, prolessors and
culture in general. This would re-
Iieve what he ieels is a very dis»
torted racial situation.

When asked about the general sa-
tislaction and happiness oi black
students here Mr. Thornton won—
tiered aloud how happy blacks have
ever been. But he did make note of
the fact that blacks can and do at-
taln Skills here that they will need
to be iunctioning members oi the
black world,

Some black students are perturbed
by what they tee] is an unwritten
quota Olblack students admitted here
:it Gl‘innell. These students feel that
it is not at all necessary to view
blacks as polilicai animals. If the
right places are searched, he be
licves, plenty oi excellentnlackstu-
dents and professors Can be found.
Tile recruitment of black students
and proicssors, heinsists, wouldhot
lower standards,butinsteadbroaden
them,

Mr. Thornton is worried that Feds
el'al controls may force Grinnell ti)
take on ahy blacks to meet quota
standards. He [eels that this is not
necessary and that Grinnell must
"clean up its own house" before
being told to do so.

Mr, Thornton has led an active
life while all the same time teach
ing in several schools in the East
in different capacities. He was a
friend of Dr, Martin Luther King
and worked Closely with him in the
iormation of S.N.C.C

The second motion considered was
to give the Executive Council the
power to make recommendations on
the current operating budget. Pre-
sently the council reviews only the
educational budget which is predom-
inanily comprised oi iacuity sala-
ries. Since the budget must be
completed by a deadline. the re
viewing procedure by the Council
would not be necessary tor the
completion Of the, budget. Thus,
the option to review is entirely up
to the Council,

This motion must be approved by
the Trustees, so a call tor a quorum
was made before the vote wastaken,
A quorum was not present, and the
meeting adiourned at5;59p,m. mak~
ing this the longest iaculty meeting

 

oi the year.
