MACALASTER

President James Robinson at Ma-
calaster College recently announced
plans tor a series of open forums
dealing with the “quality of life in
> student housing." Reallocations of
money resources are the prime
topic. The forums will be run by a
Mac Anthropology professor who is
studying the Macalaster culture.
The Mac Weekly also reports that
the college, in deep ﬁnancial trouble
as oi late, has responded by elimi—
nating all counseling staffand cutting
back on administrative staff. The
college budget has also been reduced
in other areas, including a ireeze
ot taculty salaries across theboard.

administration will have to release
many proiessors, due to lack ci

funds. ”To see that the students
learn a lot they make them work,“
claimed one student, and thus retain
their jobs.

Juniors and seniors continued to
express the belief that a "move—
ment" was needed. At the beginning
of the meeting the organizers spoke
of the "movement" to ease academic
pressure, and the rhetoric was
picked upby many students. One par-
ticipant posed the question: “How
many students are here because they
feel academic pressure?" About
onerthird responded positively, a
quarter felt no pressure. The largest
number of students responded that
they came to the meeting "TO see
how it was going." This was inter-
preted by some as evidence thatstu-
dents needed a noneacademic cause.

Five iaculty members and three adr
ministrators attended the supposed
all-college meeting. Mr. Clouelter,

HASTINGS

The Hastings College StudentAsso-
Ciation voted recently to cancel a
Wednesday night SAGA meal and
contribute the money to a Pakistani
reﬂief fund. Several students pro-
tested the decisioh, however, claimr
mg a “Violation of each student's
contract with SAGA.” In any case,
the meal will not be served, no stur
dents will eat Wednesday dinner at
SAGA next week, and the $330 will
go to the relief fund.

UNIVERSITY OF NORTHERN IOWA

The Committee on Grading, created
last year by the Faculty Senate at
UNI, will present its proposals to
the Student Senate at the end of this
month. The committee is expected
to expand greatly the use ofpassr
fall options at UNI, and possibly will
recommend institution of a creditr
erase system.

Chairman or the Faculty, explained
that the faculty, too, were ieeling the
academic pressure. lie discounted
as paranoia the idea thatprotessors
were deliberately increasing course
loads and noted thatinstructorshave
great leeway in the content or their
courses.

The idea that administrative con-
servatism was evidenced inthemore
rigid requirements for special
majors evoked one of the few mo-
ments of lively debate. Those with
independents reported that the re»
quirements only served for direction
in the major, but they did not deny
an increasing conservatism.

After the first hour the focus of
discusswn shifted to social life. Two
students pointed out that the “ex-
perience of nothingness", a concept
of Gates lecturer Michael Novak,
was very evident at Grinnell. The
thesis that academic and social
problems were related to a larger
cause was born out by the discovery
that some of the six suicide at-
tempts this semester were related
to non—academic problems.

Near the end of the meeting, as
students started to leave, proposals
forwarded in Order to show the cone
sensus of the meeting. One was to
call for a day when students would
attend classes but would only discuss
the problems of academic pressure.
A second was to have Fridayastudy/
free day. The latter proposal had
been suggested in the notices about
the meeting.

After one Student pointed out that
the only thing the meeting could re—
solve is that some thoughttherewas
a problem and no one knew what to do
about it, a motion was made to dis-
cuss Tuesday night “the currentat-
mosphere on campus characterized
by the increased leelings ot acar
demic pressure, and what Grinnell
College should be."

One participant oiiered an amend-
ment to cancel classes the day before

the meeting, but when it was not
accepted as a friendly amendment
the chair did not put it to a vote. A
friendly amendment was accepted to
encourage discussion in classes.
The resolution passed 79-43. The
meeting disbanded as a delegation
was formed to inform the faculty
of the action taken.

if any consensus was achieved it
was that Grinnell, “a home for dis—
placed people,” is plagued by philo-
sophical problems that somehow
make students work more without,
necessarily, learning more. This
Seems to he linked to an over-
developed sense of individualism
alleviated slightly by mass

Drait Board
Geriatrics

From the sun's Washington Desk

’There seems to be some confusion
at the White House. Director otCom-
munications Herbert Klein recently
released an article by Selective
Service Director Curtis Tarr which
contained the iollcwing paragraph:
“One of the more important
changes brought about concerned the
age of local draft board members,
The youth committees suggested
lower ages and a curtailment of the
length of service on local boards.
Regulations previously stated that
citizens could not be appointed to
local boards unless they were at
least 30 years old. The new regu-
lations and law limit service on
local drait boards to 20 years to
20 years and set a minimum age oi
55 years. A minimum age of It! has
been set Ior appointment to local
boards."

(The Sons Washington Desk is
investigating.)

to be victimized by the new con-
trols. Labor’s leadership was anti-
Nixon anyway, so their political
anger was at worst a small loss,
and maybe a gain,

To onset to such political (vote)
losses as may result from wage and

price control efforts is expected to «.

arise from increased demand, in-
creased levels of production, re-
duced unemployment and greaterjob
security. Rising demand should in-
crease pratits without increasing
prices.

This matter needs further Clarifi-
cation than either the press or the
administration has given it. Why can
we expect lull employment, with
wage and price controls in effect,
to bring about a redistribution of
income favorable to the poverty
group? Our major basic experience
with Ihis configuration Occurred
during World War II and theimmed-
iate postwar years. Under these con-
ditions of extremeshortageotlabor,
the employment criteria were sub»
stantially altered, achieving the em-
ployment of prevtcusly unemploy-
abie people, with a resultant marked
rise in the incomes of the poorest
segment of society.

Now, what are the expansion-of-
employment policy provisions in the
NEP as it presently stands'.7 First,
a consumers’ tax reduction element
(repeal of 7% excise tax on new
cars, reduction in personal income
tax collections by raising the level
of tax-exempt income). This is de-
signed to spur an increase in con-
sumer demand. Second, a business
tax credit (reduction) tied to busi-
ness purchase of new capital goods.
Third, a set of negotiations, includ<
ing a ”temporary import tariffsur-
charge", aimed at shifting the rela—

the

$81),

tive international price ratios, thus
stimulating foreign demand for U.S.
goods, and Shifting domestic demand
away trom imports toward domestic
goods. in sum, the extent at the
shorts to achieve full employment
is based upon relatively indirect
policy measures to stimulate con-
sumer and private investment
spending.

These efforts are unlikely to be
adequate to bring about lull employ
ment, and may even have only a
limited, short-run success in re
versing a trend toward rising unem»
pioyment.

What possible solutions could come
.trom a weliare capitalist political
economy policy process? Basically,
we need a set oidecisionstoprovide
collective goods through very large
public investments As Galbraithhas
observed in The Afﬂuent Society,
the poorly served aspects ofAmerir
can lite lie in those areas where
individual (household) consumers
cannot stimulate production, be»
cause the benelits are inherently
shared; ie, collective rather than
private.

Let me mention a few broad areas
which are dominated by this col-
lective»good characteristic most
environmental quality (anti—pollu-
tion) action programs, reorganiza-
tion and development oi manpower
training and education systems; ra-
tionalization of the transportation
system; health care services devel»
opment programs. Specific Illustra-
tions of the functional impacts of
such collective goods provision pro-
grams on the employment pattern
must await some iuture gap in the
SltB’s space. in any case, the pre~
sent administration shows little in-
terest in such undertakings.
