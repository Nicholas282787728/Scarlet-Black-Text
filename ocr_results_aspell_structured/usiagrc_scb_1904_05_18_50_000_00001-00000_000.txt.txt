With a team of forty nicn pitted

A more unitorrnly high grade ag~
gregation than that exhibited by
Ames last Saturday would be hard
to ﬁnd in any institution, Material
up there is good as well as abunr
dam. and its all around excellence
is illustrated by the fact that of
the ten ﬁrst places won by the
Ames team no two were captured
by the same athlete.

Some good records were made
in the meet notwithstanding the
soft condition of the track, par
tially bccausc or a strong wind
which came down the stretch at
the back oitllt: sprinters and parts
ly bccause of the prime condition
in which the men on both sides
found themselves. Spectator-s
nevertheless were inclined to
doubt their cars when ten seconds
was announced as tho time for the
hundred. There was no criticism
of the tape lines used however
and Dad Green's shot put of 39-3
stands as the best individual per-
formance of the day.

The meet began promtly at two
o'clock, as soon after the arrival
or the Grinnell train as it was pos-
sible to make connections with
the famous Antes and Collepc
motor can line. About ﬁveltlln'
dred people were in attendance
only a couple dozen of whom were
rootch for Grinnell but the wean
ers of the scarlet and black re
ceived every mark of considerate
tion at the hands of the specta-
tors and the redorihtable Fish
Marsh himself was the most hose
prtable of all the hosts

It goes without saying that in
terest was at its highest pitch at
'the time of the hundred. A pretty
race it proved to be for a bare
yard separated the four leaders :is
they neared the tape and as Copee
land's lead over Templeton be
came evident the Ames bleach-
ers went wild with delight. When
thcrcsult was announced every
state college man was sure that

 

the day was already won, a con-
ﬁdence amply justiﬁed by the

excitement.

DIE joURNALISTEN.

A Synopsis or the Play to be Given by
the Senior class at con-i»
nienceinent Time.

As the annual Senior play of
Commencement week the class of
iooa has hit upon the unique idea
of producing an original rransla
tron ofa German masterpiece. Tire
translators have been carefully at
work upon their task for several
weeks anti rehearsals have already
begun.

“The Jottrnalisls" by Gustav
iircitag is a modern drama of
political and newspaper life in
Germany its story is as follows:
Prof.0:dcndorf,edrtor and scholar,
is in lovc with Ida, the daughter
of Colonel Berg. The Colonel
who has retired from service is
conservative to the verge of in
tolerance. Oldcndorf has accept
ed the nomination for city repre-
sent‘dtives in the Reichstag and
this together with the fact that he
is cditnrot a paperwhich upholds
political views opposite to the
Colonel's has made lrrrn no longer
a welcome guest at the Colonel's
house although it has led to no
open breach. Blunienberg.editor
of the “Corioladus,” has prevail-
ed ripon the Colonel to contribute
an unsigned article to that paper
in hopes that Olclcndorf’s paper,
the “Union,” will attack it. By
this he hopes that the Colonel
will become an open ally of the
“Coriolanus” and break with
Oldendorf. His plan succeeds
and Oldendortdepartslcaving Ida

try cousin, Adelheid Runeck, who
has just arrived.

Fl ulein Runeck is a rich heir-
ess whose parents are both
dead and who has come to the
City on business and to visit her
cousin and perhaps just a little to
see what has become of a certain

Konrad 13017, in whom she feels
particularly interested. She is
u»ed to carrying things with a
high hand soon traps
the Colonel into agreement that
Ida shall marry Oldendolf pro—

Bolzin the whirl of running the
“Union" and trying to write an
editorial, which task is impossible
owing to the state of mind into
which his knowledge of Adel<

thrown him. Bolz still loves

been driven by an irate father
