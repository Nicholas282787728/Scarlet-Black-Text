:Newton presents
Monday night at
the roller rink

‘ by nick Knapp
it you think real hard you can
Come up with exciting things to do
While at Grinnell, So 16 of us got the
yion to cruise over to the famous
ewtorl roller rink and torget it all.
No one can blame the Grlnrlell
student (or becoming delirious
about the prospect of leavtng
mpus~n0t to go canvassing, not
to see a ballet in Iowa City, not to
take GRE’S but man, to ROLLER
SKATE. One night we were
barrelling across Highway 6 In the
SRC Rally Wagon, screaming and
singing, banging on the windows
and honking the horn, getting
ready ior some plain old, get»yours
Cubesoff-while-you-can fun.

We stormed into that Newton
mer rink like the Philadelphia
Flyers and it wasn’t three minutes
before Gordon Edelstein had on his
skates and shot into the flow of
(who, arms and legs [lying in

ry direction, small children
bre ing for the rails, smoke
trailing from his wheels as he took
the first bank. Like a streak of
mining Greenhlatt hit me rink,
a d the evening seemed too perlect
tobetruewr,

And sure enough over the rink‘s
tour loudspeakers boomed the
menacing voice of the Nurse
Ratched oi the occasion:

So we begged

and a man with a radish head, tail
downwards, somewhat taken back
by our apparent intoxication from
roller skating, proved to be a good
enough guy to say “well...I just
don't..,well,..on second th, K."
OKl It's back to the rink, but just

then a man with a radish head, tail ,

upwards, smelt alcohol on our
breaths, and although it was really
Savory Cheese and Onion Pie, P
l7l,Vogi Epi which he smelt and
everyone knew it, it was, tough
luck kids, Jesus’ skating party, and
you're not invited.

If only the Church people knew
we were all nice and harmless folk
who hadspentthe better part of the
prime of our lives reading Hegel
and Kant, it only they knew that if
we looked and skated like nihilists
or libertarians it was only because
we were conservatives and wanted
to save the world. But it was their
party, and we all agreed the

,Church was entitled to keep us off

the rink,

So we climbed back into the
Rally Wagon and Mark Butterman
said ”shit” and Gordon Wondered
how many of the church people
slept with their neighbor‘s wife and
Bill Burke declared the whole
affair was a Methodist conspiracy
and the Monday Evening Roller

“'Skating Club‘ drove back along

Highway 5 to Grinnell.

Nicholas Scott, MP

by Elaine Ashbaugh

Living in London has provided
numerous Grinnell students and
some Grinnell iaculty members
with a chance to see British society
on a firsthand basis. When British
Member of Parliament Nicholas
Scott appeared in Grinnell last
week, some of these people, having
a special interest in his topic
reacted to his views,

After hearing Scott’s lecture or
speaking to him at a special video
tape interview, Grinnellians found
themselves in disagreement with
him in areas including the Irish
question, the class system, racism,
education, and the national health
and housing plans in England.

Economically, Britons are
having a rough time. So are their
national health and public housing
programs, As Steve Brenner, in-
structor in economics, says,
“Britain is trying to deal with the
problems of very expensive—
increasingly expensive social

programs at a time when their own
economy is not very robust.” Thus.
Conservative Scott and many
others, although helievmg strongly
in such programs, find themselves
Iorced to seek limitation. Brenner
points out, however, that attacks
on social programs in the United
States have possibly been greater
than those on Similar British in-
stitutions, although the British
economic situation is worse.

Scott recommended restriction
of health benefits, and finding new
means of Iunding the program, as
well as more freedom for the
recipients of health care to chose
their own doctor, hospital, etc.
Sally Snapp disagreed with Scott’s
proposal of finding additional
money, feeling that internal
changes would make this un-
necessary.

Bonny Redlich has specific
complaints against Scott's view of
the Irish situation. To Redlich.
Scott appears overly idealistic in
his belief that the Irish~English
question will simply work its selt
out, finally forming a Coalition
government,

In Contrast to Redlich, David
Green, believes that Scott took a
strong stand on the Irish question,
According to Green, Scott cons
siders members of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA)
criminals, and recommends a
continuing crackdown on the the
Scott spoke out strongly against
the fact that a majority oi IRA
money and armaments come from
United States citizens.

Major controversy arose over
the question of a distinctive class
structure existing in England.

Scott fails to see that one exists,
but Grinnelllans lound that they
did. Snapp acknowledged the
presence or a distinct class system
and added that the average Briton
is extremely conscious of hIS
“place” in society. She came into
contact with significant numbers
of Britons who identified them-
selves, first and foremost, by what
position they held in the social and
economic ranking system Snapp
remembered, in particular, one
British matron who continually
identified herseli as simply ”a
working class mum."

Professor of History and
American Studies Alan Jones felt
that Scott reflected the continuing
Conservative insensitiveness to the
Class problem. “Even in private
discussions," Jones noted. “and
while admitting that education was
a very limited access to social
mobility, he (Scott) seemed
unaware of England’s traditional
class problems.” Feeling that
Scott is really a very open and
basically liberal individual, Jones
found his unwillingness to concede
a class problem as surprising

Though Grinnellians may
disagree 'with particular points
which Scott made, they found him
to be a iairly interesting, though
not highly charged, speaker Many
were rather surprised by his
relative liberality and Ielt that he
must be far to the left in the Con-
servative party in England. As Bill
Burke pointed out, to be a Con-
servative in England simply
means you are not a socialist, you
are a believer in the tree enterprise
systemmnot that you are a non-
liberal,

1. Write an epic poem no shorter than
247 pages long using the following
