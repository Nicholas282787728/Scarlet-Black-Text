STUDENT VOICE IN LECTURES

chcral prolcsls have bccll made against facul-
ty monopoly of the lcrtulzc course committee. These
protests have met the surprising reply that the
faculty took it over \l‘llel] the sludeuis dropped it.
that the students are not enough interested ill The
choice of lectures to excl isc any influence. and
that the faculty committee would welcome studcllt
representatives with open arms. This is an interest-
ing situation.

The committee. as it now stands. i composed of
ﬁve faculty members. The addition of two students
would not clicumbc' the g-cup unduly. and would
be valuable in ccrlaiu. defillitc ways.

In the first place. the lectures are primarily for
students. and their sanction for the lectures should
be secured Ill the second place. the students who
bring lecturers here. the Christian associations.
have little intercourse with the faculty committee.
and the schedules frequently do not ﬁt together.
Witness the occurrence of The George Pierce Baker
and Kirby Page lcclurcs during the same week. Silk
dent. members of the lecture committee would he
in closer touch with the YMCA. and Y,\V.(‘.A.
officers. In the Third place. student repr clltatives
to the committee could have valuable expo lencc ill
learning something of the lectures that are ill The
field. and ill discu lg these with faculty reprcr
sentativcs.

The choice of student members presents air
other problem Obviously. llley must be truly rcp-
resentativc. and they must be capable and interest-
cd. It seems plausible that the student council could
choose two. or possibly three. persons from the
college at large to serve oil the committee.

The advantages are apparent and The choice
.would be easily accomplished; the real problem is
to make the students alva c of the necessity for
action, The student council is the logical body to
act. but call only ccho student atliludes. Could
not some discussion by the various campus groups
serve this purpose?

A SUCCESSFUL ALL-COLLEGE FORUM

Out of the melee of prejudices. ill. mmtiolls.
and wi c cracl in the Monday all-college forum.
three rvo -truclive suggestions cmcrgcd.

E ‘amilldtiolls requiring the abili to use ma»
terial in a new way with understanding and judg-
ment would render f-llbllillg impracticable. As was
pointcd out. the grading of such a test should not
be on the has .' of opinions expressed. which might,
differ from the professor’s. but on the bn. s of
understanding and general knowledge shown. The
fact that sllch exam 'eparzlle the good students
far from the poor on Si no indictment of tho sysr
tell].

Frequent drop tests might be substituted for
the semester marathons. Some drop exams would
sometimes catch sludcllts ullflwarcs. but the amt-7
age would be equitable, This measure would clim-
illdt’e cramming. which is like cheating in 1llat it
enables 1ch poor student to appr ximatc ihc work
of (he good student.

The third suggestion came from The faculty.
If sludents don’t like cheating. let them exclude
cllcatcl's from positions of honor. While this would
not be as powcrflll a wcapoll as its proponent
seemed To suppose. it might give the offender time
to study. so that he would not need to cheat.

By far the most important discovery of the
meeting was the freedom and pleasure with which
a large number of students and faculty can dis-
cuss a matter of common interest. The ﬁrst all-

college forum was a success.

WHY WE GO MAD
(From the Dartmouth)

There ought to be a course on the use of whatnot.
No writer. talker. lover. singer. soldier. sailor. profes—
sor. or whatnot should be without it.

Whatnot is a boon to all mankind. It has alleviated
distress. freed the mind from worry. and soothed what-
not from the time when our ancestors hung by their
tails. and whatnot to this quaint age of prohibition.
speakreasies. and whatnot. it has saved heroines from
villains and whatnot. it has borne the burdens of nice
girls. not so nice girls, and whatnot. It has symbolized
the college criterion of wine. women. and whatnot. It is
manna to Don Marquis. ambrosia. to Gertrude Stein. and
life itself to Isadora Duncan. Bernard Shaw. and their
whatnot.

Love is based on it; children cry for it; brides
yearn for it. It's asked for by name. some whatnot.
please It is the answer to a maidens prayer. and the
ultimate goal of rice and old shoes. Whatnot knows
no rules. brooks no deﬁnition. but stands on the iirm
foundation of whatnot. Men are made of it and die for
it. One comes from whatnot, lives a life of whatnot. and
returns to the whatnot of whatnot. wnatnot is all: it
is the means and meaning of existing. it is the highest
realization of whatnot; the ﬁnal aim of love. life. and
whatnot.

And so on. ad astra. ad internecionem. or ad what-
not. And now it's time to go to class and listen to Pro-
fessor Whatnot discourse on the theories of life. labor.
liberty andiwhatuct.

COEDS AND CAMERAS
(From the Daily Northwestern)

The weather-beaten coupe drives to a stop in front
of the University ball gate. A wiry man in a brown
overcoat gets out. dragging after him camera. box
of plates. and tripod. He is the kind of man. you can
see. who. when he speaks. is going to speak out of the
corner of his mouth; he lights a cigarette and starts
up the walk to University ball. He doesnit know that
there is a tradition against smoking on the campus.
And if he did know . .

It is the work of a moment for him to assemble
any given number of coeds (how admirably they feign
condesceusioul). and pose them with sufficient ludir
crousness about a few trophies on a table—if that
happens to be the particular excuse be is using for
catering to the public demand for intimate glimpses of
college life.

“Cross your legs.” he says to one coed seated in
the table. She does so. but without the desired result.
our photographer must be somewhat franker. “You
look like your grandmother. with skirts clear down to
your ankle. Pull up your dress a lime!”

Embarrassed compliance. audfcllck!#the scene is
preserved for thc delectation of all literature and sol-
vent Chicago rtor a day).

That’s the story. The moral (after all. this is the
editorial column) follows without so much as a pause
for breath.

The point is that coeds on this campus are not
supposed to be allowed to have their picture taken for
any newspaper without the permission of the dean of
women. in a majority of cases where pictures are taken
no such permission is given. or even requested for that
matter. The rlean of women‘s ofﬁce or the w. s. G. A.
ﬁthe two terms are interchangeable—are in much the
same position in this matter as is the United States
government with respect to prohibition. Both institu-
tions have a law, but they cannot enforce it and they
will not rescind it. _

This is no argument in favor of forcing coeds to
get their prescribed permission. It is much less an argu»
ment favoring the exercise of any regulations in this
matter at all. There are too many regulations ordering
the existence of women on this campus as it is.

But what we can dispense with is the character-
istic hypocrisy of the whole affair. Let us either have
the regulations and honestly enforce them. or do away
with the rules and allow the coed to go through college
under the assumption that she possesses an adult in-
telligence.

We prefer the latter course.
