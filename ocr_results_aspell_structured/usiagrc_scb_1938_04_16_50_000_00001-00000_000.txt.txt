The committee voted that in
view of the information presented
to it by David E. Peck, chairman
of the department of music, and
Chester W. Williams, director of
tile band, that it was the Sense
of the Committee that the sug-
gestion that the band be given
an added two per cent of the
semester fee fund be approved
with the condition that the Sug-
gestion should be considered only
when the Student Council was
considering the entire semester

cipation in the band.

proved resolution the matter was
left entirely up to the Curriculum
committee

Centraliza'l'ion

Student—Publishing
Board Would Have
Complete Control

By John Spaulding
The faculty committee on stu-
dent organizations and publica-
tions voted favorably yesterday
on a proposal by the Student
Council to centralize control of
campus publications and adopted
two resolutions to that effect.
The committee voted to petition
the board of the Grinnell Stu<
dent Publishing company as to
whether the board would assume
the responsibility of such cen~
tralized control, and if so, ask
the board to submit a plan for
handling all publications and con-
cessions involving advertising.
The committee also voted to en-
courage the junior class in a
study of plans for publication of
an annual with the stipulation
that plans should be definite as
regards financing and staff.
Under the proposed centrali-
zation plan all such publications
as the Young Men’s Christian
Association handbook, the blotter
and homecoming programs, would
be under the supervision of ,the
board of the Grinnell Student
Publishing company, incorporated
under the laws of Iowa as a non-
profit malcing organization.
Under the present setup, the
board has supervisory control
over the Scarlet and Black only.
