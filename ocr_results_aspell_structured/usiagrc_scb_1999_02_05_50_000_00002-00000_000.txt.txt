Sim/at? Eyes

Friday at Harris at 7'30 pm. Stars Nicholas Cage,
Gary Sinise, and some girlr Directed by Brian
DePalma.

Czl went to see this movie in the_theater be»
cause Nicholas Cage is hot and I thought that
maybe it would be interesting. After about 10
minutes, I realized that I had already seen the
whole movie by watching the commercials for it
on TV.

A:The first scene was visually very good. One
smooth steadicam shot,showing all the main play-
ers in the film. However, a couple of parts disapr
pointed me. First,theTarantino-esque storytelling,
using flashbacks to set the scene,felt a little forced.

Also, the hurricane blowing into Atlantic City was .

completely unnecessary.5 This movie is a con-
spiracy theory, which seems to be the current Hole
lywood fad. Since we can’t fight communists any-
more,-we have to ﬁght someone. ’

C:The fact that you found anything interesting
about this movie disappoints me, Aaron. Even
good old Nick Cage couldn't redeem this one for
me. If you want to see a movie devoid ofa good
plot line, then this is the one for you.

Courtney’s Beer Scale:

Number of Miller Genuine Drafts needed to en-
joy this movie: 5.

There‘s Something About Mary

Saturday at 7:30 in Harris. Stars Cameron
Diaz. Ben Stiller, and Matt Dillon. Directed by
the Farrelly Brothers.

C: I, like many of you, heard all the hype about
this movie before I actually went to see it. I
would have to say that my expectations were a
little too high and l was a little bit disappointed,

A: Obviously nothing breaks through
Courtney‘s icy demeanor. This movie was com-
pletely hilarious. The jokes you haven't heard
about are even funnier than the ones you have.
The characters are completely believable, even
if they are a bit slimy. This movie is 100 times
better than Kingpin, the last Fat-telly Brothers
picture. If you haven’t seen it, do. And if you
have,..hell, go see it again.

C: I agree that it was definitely funnier than
Kingpin, but that's not really hard to do. i did
enjoy some of the more subtle jokes in this
movie. The movie requires no thought whatso-
ever and, {or many of you that may be a good
thing. It’s a good way to spend your Saturday
night before things really get started on came
pus.

Courtney's Beer Scale:

2 MGDs required.

HOW Many Times Aaron Has Paid To See This
Movie:

Twice (one sneak preview) and once in the
dollar theater.

Despite the transcendent destruction of bound-

S not what She says, but how she says it that seems
ruly noteworthy. By juxtaposing examples from high

and low theory within the extant frame 0
postmodern theory, she has achieved a place i
the spotlight that most academics only dream of.

My Life In Pink is a sweet-funny film from
Belgium about a little boy, Ludovic, who is
convinced he's a girl trapped inside a boy's
body He likes to wear cottonrcandy pink
dresses, has a Barbie doll tor his guardian
angel, falls in love With the cute boy next
door,Jerome, and would do everything to be
Snow White in the school play (just so the
prince. played byJeromc, Clli] kiss him),

I loved the explanation he made up for
God’s mistake in. assigning him the wrong
gender; he fervently believes that the wrong
Will be undone Someday anti he’ll eventually
turn into a girl, just in time to marry Jerome,

So, he waits for his first period to prove
everyone wrong. At first, his parents try tO
be tolerant and undcrstilnding, believing this
is only a passing phase, but/as things become
increasingly complicated, they resolve to take
Ludovic to a psychotherapist to “Straighten"
him outr '

Eventually, the situation ostracizes the fam-
tly in their pastel-colored suburb environ
ment (think Tim Burton’s Edward
Scissorbmlds) as Ludovic becomes the target
of the conforntist community's homophobia.

The greatest thing about the film is that
it’s mostly told from Ludovic's point of view
- a true romantic confined to a world that
treats difference as if it was a diseaseThe
androgynous-looking boy actor gives an ab
solutely amazing performance, full .Of both in»
nocence and confidence. Filmed in beautiful
bright colorS,Mu Vie L‘ll Range is the most
imaginative film l’vc seen in along time,

Go see it.
