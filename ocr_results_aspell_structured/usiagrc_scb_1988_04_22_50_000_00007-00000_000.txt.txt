i remember the first time I saw
Jim Caccamo; he was peeking out
his door on Norris Second. It was
kind at sad. actually: he was too
scared to leave his room, But with
gentle coaxing he eventually got up
enough courage to come across the
hall into my mom, Within no time
at all We became friends. Ieven lei
him run sound at a concert i put on
As the year continued. the team or
Jim and Chris rivaled even that of

awas Batma Jim is too short),

that we are tree to use such things
without owning them ourselves.
Excepting these large exn
travagances, the money that we
waste on knickknacks and keep-
sakes alone could be a signilicant
contribution to other people's basic
needs l knoiv a woman very well

that her ollcction is worth tens oi

tion is merely an extreme example
oi what we all do to some extent.

i realize that lam no exception

Grinnell College, am well-endowed
with material goods. So much so,

I tend to lorgct that the only
thing 1 truly own is myseli.
Everything else is ephemeral. I
think we iorget that the rest oi our
lives are contingent largely on the
luck oi the draw. 0K, we have been
given certain opportunities to work
and make money to buy things.
who gave us the RIGHT to that
employment? Or was it just the
happy coincidence oi preparation

Gosh, looking back it’s hard to
believe it all happened without my
even noticing. First he slipped in a
happy love song every once in a

damentally better than people
born in other parts ol the world,
that we somehow deserve the stan-
'dard oi living we currently enjoy.
Do we deserve the opportunities
we have had, or were we merely
born in the right place at the right
time? We have such massive icel-
ings oi entitlement that it is simply
impossible to understand. Yet we
take everything we have had, the
love oi our parents, the massive
amounts oi money spent on us, the
irecdoms permitted us in this
country, the concern oi others,

totally {or granted, We don't sit -

back and objectively evaluate our
worthiness, nor do we realize how
privileged we are; perhaps it's too
much to ask it strikes me that our
worthiness is a function of our in-
tentions and actions. Merely living
within thc guidelines oi society is
not nearly suiiicicnt, as we are
a permissive society iyou can do
what you want, and it it doesn't
hurt me speciiically, i don't caret,
The one thing that i keep getting
back to is something I once read:
Irom those to whom much is given,
much shall be required.

To me the challenge manifests
itsell thus: How do we live up to the
values which are demanded oi
those born into privilege while re
maining unencumbered by the
baggage society will encourage us
to carry? This baggage stymies
our ability to act iorcelully. takes
irom us our ability to make decir
sions, and contradicts the very
values that we claim to proless.

The Draughtman’s
Contract

by Vincent Frossel‘

“The Draughlsman‘s Contract"
is a iilm about power 7 its posses
sion and use and what it means to
its possessors This power is a
term at gamesmanship; social
relations are deiined as a iorm oi
adventuring Set in Restoration
England. the iilm gives a real ieel-
ing ior the period, at least in so tar
as how that period has been delin~
ed by Restoration drama.

The draughtsman oithe title is at
the heart oi the politicking on a
country estate There to do
perspective Views oi the house and
grounds, he contrasts with his elr
iete aristocratic employers, and
goes so tar as to conquer the alloc-
tions oi the mistress oi the estate.

But there is more to this iilm
than the tale oi a selirmade iormer
lickspittle, in tact. there are many
levels on which this highly intellec»
tual iilm works. and it caused quite
a stir in ioiz ior its departures
irom the “formalist” values oi
typical cinema tsuch as, say, plotl
Much oi the iilm is indecipherable
unless the Viewer is willing to use
some imagination to put it all

together. The result is a iilm that, '

with the great beauty oi its iilming
and settings, is dreamlike and
lovely, Many scenes 7 such as the
outdoors evening banquet by

candlelight 7 will leave the Viewer
with a lasting impression The surr
realism of it all can. however,
become a bit much — as with the
statue of a man that comes alive
and spends the rest or the movie
sneaking about and looking highly
naked. That kind of damnable
symbolic mumbo-jumbo is so
tiresome; it becomes all too
precious.

With the creation of the various
views of the estate, and the sense
oi some impenetrable mystery
pervading the film, “The
Draughtsman's Contract" in
evitably reminds me oi Antonloni's
“BlDWrup.” but is iniiniteiy more
interesting to watch and tar more
visually rewarding. The house us-
ed for the film was restored earlier
in this century and looks
devastatingly authentic. The only
[law to the look of the film IS the
perspective drawings, which look
too commercial-art, too ”i have lit
tle talent, but [work really hard,”
and, though carefully done, ooze
inauthenticity as regards the
period

The end oi the movie is relatively
horriiic and serves to uphold the
aristocratic privileges to which the
draughtsman thought he was so
superior. Finally, we see that he
was used by the nobles, while he
had thought it was otherwise,
