Dynamite
Warrior
(2006)

Action film thrills, amus—
es, but does little else

Dyna/viii: i’Vm‘i'lm', the Thai martial alts
ﬁlm, starts With a bang7 a colorful, wellscho-
reographed ﬁght that features a masked hero
surﬁng through the air on a homemade rocket.
The sequence isjust as triumphant as it is odd
and is reminiscent of early James Bond mow
ies.

The film is set in Thailand during the
18905, just as the country begins to industrial-
ize. The evil Lord Waeng (Puttipong Sriwat)
mats to replace the farmers‘ buffalo with the
tractois he sells.The result: lots offighting. At
the same time, the hero, Jone Bang Fai (Dan
Chupong), wants to avenge the death of his
parents.This results in lots more ﬁghting.

Dymmu/r Wm IDI'lS a genre confection with
more than an uncanny resemblance to Hong
Kong martial arts movies ofthe 805.1t opts for
comedy over character and plot development,
and action over pretty much everything else.
Thc film also exhibits a dedication to keeping
an outrageously high weird quotient, especially
with Lord Waeng, whose hair resembles a lac
quered exclamation point.

The film also provides for numerous bi-
zarre scenes with a midget, a cannibal gnawing
on an enemy’s arm, ghosts, demons, and the
menstrual blood ofa virgin. The plot also has
room for a side story involving a man look-
ing for the rustler who killed his parents, an
effeminate prince, a sweet love story and, in a
supernatural twist, an odd use for the afore—
mentioned Virgin’s menstrual blood.

There is plenty to look at in Dynamic: Wat-
rim. and the skillful director, Chalerm Wonge
pim. clearly belongs to the John Woo school
of thought *or lack thereof7 and keeps eVr
erything moving along at a frenetic clip. You
barely notice the ridiculousness of the pre
ceding sccnc because the current one has too
much action to let the viewer think rationally
about anything else

Even if it brings absolutely nothing new to
the table, with a crisp running time ofa little
over 90 minutes, it never gets boring either.

ously adorable and shocking picture of life in
a rapidly liberalizing China. The film takes
place in a third grade classroom during the
election ofthe new class monitor, an occasion
especially signiﬁcant given China's longstand-
ing totalitarianism. The events that follow
give fresh insights into both modern Chinese
society and the hypocrisy underlying classic
American liberal ideology,

portrayed as extremely different stylistically so
that their conﬂict is inevnable. Xu Xiaofei is a
girl for too good natured to participate in an
election Luo Lei is an aggressive boy who has
previously held the title ofclass monitor, albeit
never as the result of an election. and Chang
Cheng, a startlingly selfrawnre and cunning
boy determined to unseat his predecessor.

The campaign then follows a trajectory
known all too well to every American watclv
ing the Obnma/Mccain slugfest this autumn.
The obligatory slanderous rcmarks and cal-
culated feints dominate, despite —or perhaps
because of— the young age of the participants.
Almost as soon as the children’s teacher deﬁnes
what it means to vote for her students, they
plunge headlong into all the uglier aspects of,
what it means to be elected.

The parents, most intriguingly, become
very involved in their children’s rivalry. Each
ofthe candidates comes from profoundly difs
ferent backgrounds, though they are all from
the same burgeoning middle class in China.
Xu Xaiofci’s mother works in a highepowered
position within a local television station and
has divorced her father, Luo Lei is the prim»
percd child of a police chief happily married
to his mother, and Clieng Cheng belongs to a
new kind of family in China— his mother is
not only divorced but remarried.

Ultimately, the parents apparently decide
the outcome ofthc election, but the children‘s
brutally honest and completely unintentional
mimicry or supposedly enlightened liberal
democratic practices speaks to universality of
both the desire to be' in power, as well as the
neeholds-bdrred approach even the most naive
children will take to get that power. It’s hard to

Brazilian corruption falls
under ﬁlm’s gaze

gmthcring the stories of people as dis
verse as a frog farmer. an American business-
man, a plastic surgeon. an attorney, a cop, a
kidnapping victim, and a kidnappcr,Mmrr1a
Bola. a ﬁlm from ﬁrstetime ﬁlmmaker Jason
Kohn, pieces together a comprehensive picture
ofBrazil’s wide—spread corruption.

Eye-opening, if somewhat scattered, Man-
da Bﬂ/R begins by proclaiming that it is “a ﬁlm
that cannot be shown in Brazil," Knowing that
he can only skim the surface of Brazil’s dire
situation in Manda Biz/11’s 85rminute runtimc,

nappings that occur daily in Brazil's economic
capital, Sao Paolo.

Kidnapping has developed into a Complex
industry of sorts in Sao Paulo. The wealthy
try to protect themselves by buying bulletproof
cais—SO companies sell them—and taking
classes on how to drive them during roadway
kidnapping attempts, One company has de,

chipped." And since kidnappers oftentimes
send pieces of victims’ ears to their families
to encourage quick delivery ofransom money,
a plastic surgeon has perfected an ear recons
struction technique speciﬁcally suited to such
injuries,

An account of Brazil’s arguably most core
rupr politician also takes a central role in ext
plaining the culture of corruption and graft
While Jadcr Barbalho has held every elected
office in Brazil except for the presidency, some
attorneys have devoted their lives to bringing
him down. Barbalho is accused of diverting
billions of dollars from public funds for his
own personal gain and subsequently buying
the votes of the poor, quite literally with the
money he has stolen from them,

While all of its stories are Fascinating,
Mmldﬂ BIZ/n struggles to connect its disjointed
parts. Kohn attempts to tie together his ac
counts ofpolitical scandal and Sale Paolos kid»
napping epidemic by intermittently referring
to images from the worlds largest frog farm,
located' in Brazil. Thousands of frogs writhe
against each other in huge pools, unaware that
they are waiting to be slaughtered, deep-fried,
and served to the wealthy in ﬁvesstar restaus
rants. We witness every stage in this process,
and the imagery reminds us that this ﬁlm is
not rated.

The frog footage suggests a metaphor for
the have nots of Brazil fed upon by corrupt
politicians and the inconceivablywcalthy upper
class, but doesn't offer a way to fix the problem.
Mair/in Bit/ifs gorgeously textured soundtrack
and award-winning cinematography distract
from its bleakness, but in the end, there is no
solution proposed for Brazil's corruption here,
only a beautifully graphic depiction ot‘it,
