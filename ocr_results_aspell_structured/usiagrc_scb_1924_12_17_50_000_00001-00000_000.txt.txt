VAHSllY BAGEHE MEET

Freshmen Emil outclassed in First
Mix of Season—To Pllly Only One
Pro-Season Game.

With the pre-season game with Wis-
consin university less than a Week
away, Coach "Charlie" Black is push
ing the Pioneer cagers hard in an ef~
fort to get them in the best shape pos—
sible when they tackle the Badgers.

The squad was sent against the
freshman team for the first time last
night and made a good showing, hav-
ing no difficulty in leading the preps
by a safe margin at all time through»
out the scrimmage. Captain Gelvin
at running guard Moran at forward,
and Boge at center, looked best [or the_
varsity, while Smiley, Davis, and
Peterson starred for the yearling
team

Gull in at Guard

Captain Gelvin is being used at rum
ruuing guard this year, and is playingY
his strong game that he displa) d lastl
lyeal‘, before it became necessaly to
shilt bun to forward in the latter part
of the season. Wing and winter, both
lcttermcn, are putting up a desperate
‘fight for the other guard berth, with,
Wing having the slight edge at pres-
~ellt, although it is about a tossup as
lto whom will start against the and.
gels,

, "Hap" ltloran is holding down one
forward position in fine style. although
it is causing the coach no little trouble
to find a suitable running mate for the
former All-American high school st'a'
nofting is getting the call now, sl—
-although he is receiving healthy up
position from Larson and J. stotts. At
center, Boge is as good as ever, and
with two years of varsity experience
behind him, should display a better
.hrand of ball than over this season,
laltbough he is being pushed hard by
Seeland, who is playiug a much bet-
ter game than he (lid last year,

Strong Defense

Defensively, the team is stronger
than last year, although the absence
of Benz, last year's captain, makes a
noticeable hole in the offense, but des—
pite the fact that Moran appears to be
nearly as good an offensive player, the
former Pioneer captain will be great
ly missed, this year unless a successor
can be developed.

Tile team will play the only one
preseason game against Wisconsin,
as a suitable date could not be ar-
ranged for another game, The Comm
pal-ative strength or the Badgers is
not known, but they are always strong
contenders for the Big Ten title, and
the outcome will give Grinnell follow—
ers a definite line on the possible
strength of Coach Black's proteges be.

it by the League President, The

the girls made an impressive picture.

Jeanne Flatt as President of the

The Carol Service held in Herrick

chapel last Sunday pleased a large
audience. The service took the place
of the Customary rendition of the
“Messiah." The college choir, direct»
ed by Elias Elliot, and several soloists
performed.

The greater part of the program was
_ iron by G, Herbert Knight at the urn
gan. Di Knight played two groups,
one a Christmas Suite by Otto \l'hlling
and compositions by Cullmant and
Dtibois. His last number, "The March
of the Magi Kings” Caused Ti great deal
of speculation. There were many in
the audience who wondered how the
high note was sustained throughout
the entire composition.

The college Choir contributed all all»
them, Philip Kalal' and the Men's
Glee Clllli sang an arrangement of the
popular ”Silent night, holy night." Mr,
Faguy-Cute sang “0 Holy Night” by

Final Address of Hﬂl'wll‘ll Ex-
change Lecturer.

The closing lecture of I’l'nlessor
George D. Birklloif, Harvard evchahge
lecturer which he delivered in long
chapel this morning, was a plea for
the acceptance of the theory of re-
latlvity. _ ‘

"There is no simpler concept which
has any larger application than this-
theory," he declared.

“Relativity is not purcly realistic.
A study of the theory shows that a
new set of abstractions must he form-
ed. But the abstract, when first dis-
covered and prcscnted by Plato was
la staggering tiling.”

Abstractions Trillcod

Profcssor Birkhoff traced the growth
or our knowledge of the abstract,
First, abstractions are based on illttti-‘
tiou. Second, abstractions arc lim»
lited vehicles for human thought. Third,
abstractions grow; none of them have
,ever been discarded but they have
lcnntinually becil builaod upon, Fourth,
it makes no great difference upon what
particular things form the basis of an
abstraction. The only way in which
it would be possible for schools of
philosophy to differ would be if they
disagreed upon the facts. But they
,dc not, They disagree on the litter-
pletation of fllcts. forth, the useful
ness of abstraction is absolutely de~
pendent upon simplic' y and upon
range of application Relativity is
the only theory known to man at pres.
ent which answers this riual require-
ment,

The biological point of vicw is one

The psychological school is charact-

The social level is one ethical ideal-

bination of the abstract and the real-

cial are almost entirely realistic in
their present stage of development.
