A recent news item tells of the discontinuance of
compulsory undergraduate chapel attendance at Yale, With
the abandonment or the compulsory feature at Yale, it is
possible that the eastern university's chapel may become a
true center of educational and cultural value for students ‘
ol the institution.

r The tradition of life, liberty and the pursuit of
happiness may he ouet of date with respect to some
phases of man' life, hilt there stiill seems to be a direct
eo-relation between these principles and the heneﬁts of
chapel attendance. Just as arbitrary law tends to give
zest to evasion, so also a degree of freedom seems con-
ducive to a spirit of genuine reccptiveness, at least llltll
regard to chapel. ’

Indeed, so democratic is the atmosphere of the
Grinnell chapel that for the many who have gained some—
thing ol the spirit of the college, the chapel is a symbol
of the essential culture of Grinnell! When alumni return.
they invariably visit chapel to feel the throb or college
life once more. It is signiﬁcant that a chapel Service

has been scheduled its a feature of Pioneer Day, an all

college celobl‘ lion.
