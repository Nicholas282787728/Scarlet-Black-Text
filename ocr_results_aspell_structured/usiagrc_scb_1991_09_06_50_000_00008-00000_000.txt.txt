Grinnell men‘s soccer team faceda
much more aim and aggressive
Alum team titan in years past This
new Alum image was largely due to
the excellentplay of’I‘om McCuIIen,
Ian Lorimar. and Brad Bisgard.
McCullen andlnrimarled theAlum
offense while outstanding play by
EisgardandDrJohnl-Liggensmain-
tained a strong defense.

Grinnell was also equipped with
its own power players. Four retum-
ing staners: ErichGiebelhaus, Doug
Hodum, Tim Edmunds, and Matt
Schrager, all fullbacks, handily
stopped any Alum attempt to score
on freshman goalie Nate
Brennaman. Even with Papa
Owusu's quick speed and Bruno
Alicke'sexcellentpassingﬂrinnell
wasn’t able to get by the Alum‘s
tough defense. By the end of the
ﬁrsthalf, both teamswerescoreless
but anxious to resume play.

In the second half. several play»
ers saw action as Coach Pfitsch
rotated his Ereshman and varsity
teams to keep hisplayers fresh. Ten
minutes into the second half, Ian
Lotimar dribbled his way through
Grinnell haltbacks and fullbacks to
score on Brennaman. Andy Laing
earned the assist on Lorimar's goal.

Grinnell tied the score twenty-
ftve minutes into the second half,
when fresh Zach Diet: look advanr
tage of Alum substitutions which
gave Bisgard, McCullen. and
lorlmar a rest. With Dietz’s score,
the match was tied at 1 goal apiece
and remained that way till its con-
clusion.

Volleyball team defeats Grandview, earns
Victory with "scrappy" play

By Grey Gardner

Hidden in the seam of the sports
world dwells a group of athletes
anxious to break loose. In the eyes
of the majority, the volleyball rolls
out once or twice a year on a clear.
Saturday afternoon during a picnic
in the park...a burger in one hand,
a drink in theother,and amakeshift
court in the distance. Yet, to a cerr
lain few, the sport inspires a great
deal more emotion and tends to
become a way of life.

The women’s volleyball leam is
composed of many such Individu-
als. For nearly a month. they have
been on campus getting into condir
Lion and refining skills for the up-
coming fall season. Under the lead-
ership of new head Coach Lori
Sadewater, the group has trained
vigorously in the stiﬂing heat of

Darby gymnasium for what most
consider a“rebuildtng"year forthe
progmm.0nthecontrary,mis group
may be one of the most talented
Grinnell teams in recent history.
Theyoungcrew secmspoised to
take many teams by surprise in the

next few months. According to
coach Sadewater, the team should
assumelheroleofunderdogin most
of its matches. Yet, she appears
comfortable with thlsunsuspceung
role.
"Outplayersgenetallylacirsize.
We're a small team. . .but we make

up for that deficit with quick and
scrappy play." she said.

On Wednesday. a somewhat
young but talented Pioneer team
took the floor in route to a 372
victory over Grandvicw college.
Gnnnell started four new team
members behind senior veterans
Amy Robinson and Susan Egbert.
The consistency of Roblnson'ssctn
ting and the superb all-around play
of Egbert were complimented by
lhe excellent hustle and skill of
their teammates. The squad per
formed extremely well after play
ing only a few weeks together.

A large and vocal crowd wit-
ncsscd the Pioneer’s ﬁrst victory of
the season.

The Pioneers play at home this
Saturday in a triangular between
the University ofDubuque and Iowa

son begins this weekend with the
u-aditjonal Grinnell Tournament.

ThePioneers have etghtofeleven
starters retummg to the line-up and
a variety of new faces that should
have an immediate impact on the
team’s performances. Coach
Eskildsen believes theteamis‘betr
ter titan last year" skill-wise and
feels that the team has a deeper
bench than it did last season.

The defense returns four starters:
seniors sweeper Jen Wood and
goalie Asha Morgan and outside
backs Ris Taylor.a junior, and Jana
Murchison, a sophomore. Sopho-
more Guen Gifford will also aid in
both the defense and the midﬁeld.
The midfield will be bolstered by
junior Amy lo Reinhartand sopho-
more Cindy Harris. The offense
includes veteran juniors Marta
Fmboni and Anya Schwanz.

In addition to these returning
players, Coach Eskildsen said that
freshwomen forwards MelaniePar~

son and Erin Kilgore will have a
very immediate impacton the team.
Both oflhese women willsee‘bonr
siderablc time”, according to
Eskildsen. Additions of
freshwomen AmyNeeveland Sarah
Edmunds will offset the loss of
Susan Thomas in the midfield.

Despite the relative inexperience
of the new players, Eskildsen be~
lieves that if the team plays “hard
and together every game," things
will go their way. While the team
does have a tough schedule, play-
ing some very good Nonhem Divir
sion teams, the women are highly
motivated to repeat as Southern
Division champions and defeat
teams thatbeat them Iastyear. Their
