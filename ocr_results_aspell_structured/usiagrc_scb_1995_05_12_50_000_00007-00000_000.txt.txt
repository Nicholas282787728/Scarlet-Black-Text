wait, that'sjtist meaningless propaganda
fed to us by Gilettc, Actually, there was a
signiﬁcant increase in CPP movement.
Of course, we knew thisever sitice Octo-

infomiants at Ceivles told us they ivere

The difference in consumption per
eapita was shown to be signiﬁcant after
running three tests, First we ran the 100
yard dash, Matt was eggplant and Jason
was chicken. CPP wasted that nasty

The Exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test yields

Speaking of Chicken Patty

 

' PA'SANM, we have uncovered the

biggest scandal Since we stole the erkle
our freshman year. Our associate. Dieter

expect McConnell to make some correc-

LETTERS .
To the Editor
Students not guilty of racism

We want to inform the campus about a
shocking confrontation on our ﬂoor.
Throughout this school year, there have
been conﬂicts about noise on Read 15!.
Our hallmate, Kristy Johnson, Consis—
tently undermined attempts to solve the
problem by controlling discussion on the
issue and refusing to listen to suggestions
of compromise. This conflict erupted
wlieti we indirectly conﬁronrcd Kristy by
writingcomplaintson herdrycraseboard.

Sinoetheri,wehavebeenthefocus of
her vicious retaliation in the form of loud
antrwhite mpmusic played into the hair
way, verbal abuse, nameealiing, intimi-
dating glares and threats implying physi
cal violence (delivered in front of Read
Hall members, Ion Smoker, Jennifer
i<rohn and Siclinda CantyrElljott).

We have been summoned to the
police for questioning. We feel that our
indirect Confrontation about hall issues
does not eonsn'tute harrassment, much
less racial harrassmenL We have not only
been wrongly accused but also person
ally attacked.
