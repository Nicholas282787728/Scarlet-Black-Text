Most of the other nine colleges in the us
News it World Report's survey at private
institutions have begun or are looking ior
candidates to iill a Women’s Studies pro
gram, according to Ashley Smith. The in-
tellectual signilicancc oi Women's Studies
and ieminist theory remains largely
unknown to students here. This will con-
tinue until a Women’s Studies program is
cultivated

Mike Cleary

The need ior a given Women's Studies
program depends on the structure and
aims oi the program. This in turn will be
determined by the iuture Noun proiessor,
so we can only speak generally about the
role oi icminist theory at the college,

The need ior feminist theory in the Col~
loge is more clear. We need an introduce
tory course in feminist theory to expose
students to this scholarship at an early
stage. First. the program would introduce
ieminist scholarship to the college. Se-
cond, it would help faculty to integrate
reminist theory into the curriculum The
Noun proiessor will be a resource person
for the faculty.

Roberta Atwcll describes ieminist
theory as a diiierent kind of insight than
we have traditionally used to understand
the world. it can apply to almost any
academic field One recent candidate tor
the Noun position pointed out that we cons
sider the sciences vuliieirec. However,
there are certain assumptions made

Studies

within them which contain implicit biases.
In biology. certain things are assumed
about male and female behavior which are
not true of lower animals. Psychologists
have typically studied white male rats in
their tests. There are claims that feminist
theories can altecl chemistry, physics,
and even mathematics.

Obviously, feminist theory can tremen-
dously affect the humanities and the social
science. The canons oi great literature
may have been decided by a predominate-
ly male perspective, Certainly the works
oi a great many women authors and their
insights have been ignored. Aesthetic Stan-
dards in music and painting as well would
be thoroughly re-examined in light at the
ieminist perspective.

History tends to emphasize the record of
events and w s and downplays the social
conditions which may have inﬂuenced
such events. A feminist historian might ins
vestigafe what. social conditions occui-
given certain patterns oi home life or how
the introduction of birth control affects
society Feminist Scholarship has already
appeared in anthropology and sociology.

The influence of feminist theory extends
beyond academics to the way we live. It
relates to the way we View our roles and
our stereotypes. It leads to reassessing
and changing the way we see each other
and how we treat. each other. “I can't. help
but. believe that it will have an effect on the
way women and men see their roles."suys
Alwell. .

The new and persuasive interpretations
H. has advanced in many lields, its accep-
tance by other universities, and its
tremendous potential apparently leave no
doubt of its necessity as a field of

academic study. Yet there have been
delays in the establishment oi the
Women's studies program, Four can
didates have been rejected already and
students question this.

Certain institutional problems tace the
Women‘s Studies program. There is some
faculty resistance to feminist theory, but
in general the faculty shows much interest
in the theory. Nevertheless, complete
academic credibility may be granted slow-
1y,

The position requires someone who can
teach. who has excellent academic creden»
tials, and can administrate the develop
mcnt oi Women's Studies in the cur-

'riculum at large. These requirements
make it diiiicult to find acceptable can»
didates to till the position. The term
“Superwoman" is otten used to refer to the
eventual professor oi Women’s studies.

A great. deal ol status is attached to the
position. which makes it even more impure
taut that the right candidate be selected.
The Noun Chair is unique because it is the
first endowed chair to be recruited irom
outside the current faculty. The chosen
candidate will be elevated in the eyes at
many just tor meeting the demands oi the
position, The faculty and administrators
who will choose the candidate tor the posts
lion have thus proceeded with deliberate
care.

The care taken in the hiring decision im» ‘

. prove the prospects oi ugood Women's

Studies program. In the end. however, ln~
stitutional prerogatives must yield to in-
tellectual prerogatives. The potential ins
lellectual and social impact of feminist
theory encompasses our daily lives. Its
value to the college will surely be as great.

From the SGA Prasideiit

i think that 1 Speak tor a large number or
students when I say that I am very upset
about the Trustees' decision to reconsider
the May 1935 resolution concerning‘Soulh
Airica. The iollowing is a copy at the letter
i recently sent to the Trustees, i feel you
should all know where I stand, since I sign-
ed both as a student, and us next year‘s
SGA President.

I think this is an issue that we should all
be very concerned about, and it anyone
would like to write a letter oi their own and
have it sent to the Trustees they should
give it to Helen wicse. NolIen 2nd. I would
also appreciate any feedback on this issue

The resolution you have now abandoned
was already a compromise: the result oi 14
years oi student protests opposing the

Africa and your continued financial sup
port of that system. Your reconsideration
oi that resolution is a move in the wrong
direction and it another 14 years oiprotcst
