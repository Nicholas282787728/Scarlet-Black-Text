Le'H'ers To The Edifor

(continued from page 2)

Certainly not violations of the
drinking rule and the car rule.
It seems to me that before we
have a unified student govern-
ment organization which will
make a student, even an una»
ware student, note is impact on
his campus activities, the gov-
ennment should have some
thing more important to enforce
than quiet hour violations.
Sincerely yours,
Howard G. Kranc
Blessings be
children:
0n bended knees we kiss the
hems of your respective frocks,
dear sweet, fair ﬂowers of Grin—
nell, and we beg your forgive-
ness. Also on bended knees we
ask your pardon, O! Upright,
Upstanding, and Manly Males of
Grinnell. ”And :ior why?” you
in your tremulous fashion ask.
"For why?"

And our reply is: “We have
braved uncharted seas for you.
We have undergone countless
risks, iaced terrible dangers for
you. We have even met the
bearded lion in his cave, and
striven for you. (Not to men:
tion the bald-gated bird of
prey,- nor, the statisticaloae.
chanical Manofmight! Nor the

upon you, my

 

gnomesohthe-torest-withwaste
baskets—for-heads! ) ”

“Huzza‘h! Huzzah! Huzzah!”
you clamor, your sweat—glands
expiating. “More! Morel More!”

“But now, on bended knees,
with ltearrfui eyes, With dog-
beaten, dogreared, hang~dog,
mud-splattered, grayesmitten ‘T'
shirts, we let out our handsﬁ
hands that have undergone and
witnessed tortures no mortal
could withstand, hands that have
raisedeu-p the Sword in your be»
half. Now they are empty. Piti—
fully empty. (But they are
filled, or so we will be told,
with dollar bills and twenty-
five cent pieces fresh, but dirty,
clean.) And they must now be
from the mints at Colorado and
Penn."

Cry not ”This the work of
the Administration!” Cry not
"This is the eviledoings of some
mad genius!” Cry not “This is a
mechanization of. or a manifes-
tation of, or a consequence of
our modern capitalistic society!"
Cry not, dear friends. For it is
now out of our hands i i .
