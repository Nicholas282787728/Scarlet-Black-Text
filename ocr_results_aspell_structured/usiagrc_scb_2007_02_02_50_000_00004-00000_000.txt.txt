Cold weather stuns Cal

Poly crops

Bv TRISTAN AIRD

(U—VVIRE) SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif
- Avocado fruits were likely damaged more
than any other crop growing on campus as
the result of cold weather throughout Janur
ary, Cal Poly orchard production manager
Mark Welch said last Friday.

Welch estimated that roughly 90 per
cent of the avocados and 10 to 25 percent
of the citrus fruits on campus were dam-
aged because of temperatures that dipped
into the 205 in mieranuary, contributing to
an estimated 826 million worth of damages
countywide. He added, however, that the tits
act figures will not be known until insurance
adjusters from Fresno visit Cal Poly some-
time this week.

"I’m hedging that prices will be going up
for our returns for the fees," said Welch, who
manages about 60 acres ofcrops on campus.

Low temperatures in San Luis Obispo,
Calif, for days from Jan. 11 to 24 were no
higher than 37 degrees, according to Weath»
er.com.Three of those days had lows in the
20s, including a low of22 degrees Jan. 14.

“We didn’t have cold weather like over
the hill in Paso Robles,"Welch said.“At least
we would heat back up. For Cal Poly, it was
really cold. 1 think whar
helped us is we had orchard
heaters placed throughout
the citrus and avocado."

The orchard heaters
primarily helped citrus
fruits other than the 157
plus acres of lemons.

“The 10~to~25 percent
estimated damage is for
lemons," he said. “It seems
like all the other fruit we
have is fine. The lemons do
not have orchard heaters."

Welch said Cal Poly was not hit as hard
across the board as agriculture in surround-
ing areas.

“We're actually in better shape than
Cayucos and Morro Bay,"he said. “We were
very well protected, but it was cold. The
frostrproteclion technique is to water the
ground thoroughly before it freezes."

Horticulture and crop sciences faculty
member Keith Patterson, who manages the
school's crops of grapes, said that watering
was a technique that came in handy. Pattern
son said Friday it does not appear the 12 stu—

A weekly view from out-
side the cornfields

dentrrun acres of grapes on campus suffered
any signiﬁcant damage.

“A lot of it depends on the health of the
plant before the cold weather," Patterson
said. “Plants that have been well—watered
have a better chance."

Patterson said the temperatures over the
past three weeks were out of the ordinary for
January

“It's been so long since we've seen anyr
thin this cold," he said.

\%/elch said that Cal Poly’s citrus fruits
are targeted to harvest in September.

“They can selfrheal," he said. “We’re not
as bad as the (san Joaquin) valley, that's for
sure. I really won't be 100 percent sure until
March or April."

Insurance adjusters have dealt with more
than 2,800 claims in the Fresno area since
the cold temperatures arrived, Welch said.

“It's a grading process,"Welch said of the
insurance adjustment. “They’ll give us an
average. You get Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 and you
get a certain price for a No. 1. That’s for the
citrus. For the avocados, they have different
numbers, but it’s the same concept.”

Launnie Ginn, a crops technician at Cal
Poly, agreed with Welch that the avocados

suffered the most sig-
nificant damage. He
said they were harder
to protect than citrus
fruits because of their
com osition.

“ efinitely the
avocados are the most
sensitive,” Ginn said.
“Their structure as
they’re a tropical crop.
I think it’s just basically
the structure, the cells."

Ginn said the fiscal

impact of the cold weather could be Considr
erable.

"It’ll have a lot ofimpact on avocado and
citrus,” he said. “Ri ht now I think every-
body is trying to scﬁ what they have. Once
that's gone, it 11 go up. As far as here at Poly,
it's going to hurt our revenues."

an Luis Obispo County as a whole
anticipates losing 60 percent of its avocado
crops, according to a memo county agricul-
tural commissioner Robert F. Lilley sent to
Governor's Office of Emergency Services
director Henry R. Rentcria dated Jan. 22.

Herrick to stay

Organ renovation last step of Her-
rick’s full renovation

Bv TJ HAWLEv

Over winter break, the Herrick Chapel organ traveled to
New Haven, CT, to be cleaned and repaired. But few noticed
the organs absence because few students enter Herrick since
Convocation was moved to the Rosenf‘ield Center.

Upon completion of the Roscnfield center. the college
centralized many of its ofﬁces and the administration moved
Convocation from Herrick to Rosenﬁeld Room 101. The
move was motivated by a number of considerations, including
complaints about the chapel as well as plans to renovate both
the chapel and organ. School administrators maintain that use
of Herrick will not be phased out, but will instead continue to
host large cninpus events.

The move has thus far provcn successful. Prior to the cams

‘pus center, only Herrick offered enough sitting space to host

major events. but, according to President Osgood, the 600
person seating capacity was actually too large, causing many to
complain. Room 101 only seats 225, providing a more intimate
spaceThe more modern room also provides more technologi-
cal features for multi-media presentations.

In moving convocation from Herrick, rhe administration
also distanced itself from the controversy surrounding the m,
ligious character of the building. “Some people were uncomr
fortable having convocation in Herrick," said Chaplain Deanna
Shorb, because oftlie stained glass and the crosses.

Others miss the Herrick atmosphere. “The room has more
character," said Greg Hudson '09.

Even some students who did not go to convocation or regue
larly use the chapel felt a connection to the building. “It’s a
beautiful building so it should be used,” said Ben Raphaelson
'08,who said he iarely attends convocations.

In order to keep the chapel useablc, Herrick was completely
renovated'rhe building now has air conditioning, as well as a
new serge lighring system and sound system.Thc stained glass
windows were also cleaned and restored. The building will be
ﬁnally completed in 2008 when the organ renovation is ﬁnr
ished.

Although the organ was in reasonably good condition for
its age, largerscalc repairs were necessary Previously, "we had
been limping along using small fixes," said Osgood. Grinnell
followed the recommendation of rho New Haven Company
and decided to do complete restoration work. Vice President
for Institutional Planning and Associate Dean Marci Sortor
said that Grinnell is lucky because the man who is primarily
restoring Grinnell’s organ is the son ofthc man who originally
built it.

Sortor also reiterated that Herrick will be used at special
events in the future, especially music events. However, it may
get less use than normal for non-religious events until repairs
are complete. “The pipe organ is a major undertaking," said
Vice President for Student services Tom crady. ”The pipe or-
gan is so extensiVHnCc you start to take apart you can't use
the space." For example, Herrick was filled with large boxes
during winter break because each pipe had to be boxed indie
vidually. For the meantime, a smaller organ has been purchased
for use and religious services as well as daily morning medita—
tion will continue as usual.
