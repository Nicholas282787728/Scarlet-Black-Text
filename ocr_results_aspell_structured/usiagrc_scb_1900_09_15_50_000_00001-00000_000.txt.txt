manner of tormeryears. An out-
of-town speaker was invited to
address the students upon that
important day, the Firstof the col.
lege year. Atter a tew words of
welcome and advice to old and
new students alike from Pres.
Gates. Rev. Cady, pastor of the
First Congregational Church of
Iowa City, was introduced as the
speaker of the occasion,

,The “Limits of Heredity." The
speaker made an excellent point,
which should make a deep ims
pression upon the minds of all
young people. and especially that
most favored class of young peos
plcithose who attend college.
After an introductory review of
the results of scientﬁc research in
criminology, the elements largely
responsible for the moulding of
most characters were found to be
heredity and environment, yet, in
spite of the power in these two
forces. the supreme rules in each
individual lies in his personality.
It is his mind, it is his soul. This

productive only of good.

Y, w. C. A. Reception.

(in Friday p. m. occurred the
annual.reception to new girls
given by the v. w. C. A. The
society halls, which had been
made home like with cozy corners,
decorations of goldent-od, etc,
were unusually well ﬁlled. The
hours trom 4 to 6 passed very
pieasanny in renewing and torm:
ing acquaintances. Messrs, Nol-
len, Tutner and Trainer, attired in
the daintiest of white duck, as-
sisted the young ladies in serving
refreshments, which consisted of
ice and cake.

There is nothing iii these ﬁrst
days of the college year which
makes the new students feel the
interest taken in them by the old
students more than these recep-
tions, planned by the christian as
sociations.

The Handbook.

The Y. M. and Y. W. C. A. are
to be congratulated upon the
hand-book as compiled by the
committee representingthese two
organizations and having the work

in charge.

It is neatly bound in a leather
cover and'coutains general infors
mation about the Y, M. and Y. W.
c. A as also the other college
organi ations. It also contains a
schedule of the daily recitations,
It has required considerable time
on the part of the committee and
considerable expense on the part
of the organizations and we hope
that everyone may avail himself
of the information therein con-
tained, and so avoid many useless
questions.

Throughthishandshooltahearty
welcome is extended to all the
new students into the various
organizations of the college.
