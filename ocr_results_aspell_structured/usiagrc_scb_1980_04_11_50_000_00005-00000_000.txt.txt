Baylor paper
resumes

Playboy arrived and the student
newspaper returned to Baylor Univer-
sity recently. keeping attention iocus-
ed on tiic campus where three student
editors were fired for defending the
right oi ieniaie students to pose lor the
magazine.

BU President Abner McCall tired
the trio after they criticized him for
threatening to discipline students who
posed nude ior Playboy. Twenty staii
members then resigned in protest and
publication was suspended for three
weeks.

McCall's threat didn't keep Playboy
photographer David Chan away, nor
did it stop Baylor women, including
one or llle ousted editors, irom apply
ing to be included in the Playboy
feature on women of the Southwest
