0 UR DEBUT.

As the SCARLET AND BLACK enters into its thirty-
fiith year as the oiiicial newspaper oi Grinnell college
under a new management, the eyes at the students, the
iaculty and the alumni are turned upon the lirst issue
to detect, it possible, the radical changes. the proposed
innovauons, and the new editorial policy that is attri —
uted to a ‘new management.

As we embark on this venture we turn our eyes
backward to the founders oi the SCARLET AND BLACK,
to previous managements that have experienced the joys
and disappointments oi newspaper editing and from them
glean words of wisdom.

There will be no radical changes in the SCARLET
AND‘BLACK. We shall strive to continue to employ the
same high grade journalism that has characterized the
CARLET AND BLACK the past year. Our creed, if a
newspaper may have a creed, is taken from the editorial
section or the little iuur column paper that appeared
for the tirst time thirty tive years ago ‘

"The mam cltot-t ol the publication is full} to i‘epier
sent the ginning interests oi the college along maiii
lines . . .

“\i'r nish to amid; the Scarlet and Ellick truly a
student's paper. We shall arm fully to rcprosent and
recognize the interests at the college in turnishing new:
at mil} that oi interest to the snliscrrhcrs and all or i ,
tcrcst. . .

“In all its departments a strict regard for truth shall
he maintained . . .

"\Ve desire and shall him to antagonize no organiza-
tion of the college, and if our efforts succeed no triction
will result . . . "

These are the same fundamental motives that the
new management will strive to execute,
news; tolerance and conservatism oi editor
tiality towards individuals, organizations and faculty; and
an eager desire to be of service in promoting everything
for the good or the college might well he set forth as our-
specitio aims. These things however, are not necessaril}
our ideals; rather they are the idcnticnl goals towards
which our predecessors have striven and to which we
pledge ourselves.

in the course or our Work it is rnctitalrlc that we
shall “tread on sulneone’s toes" no matter uhnt side or
a question we ruay take. While we expect to retain the
triendship or every reader or this colnrun, we shall not
retract a" statement nor suhjiigate our v u-s to iind favor
with any group We anticipate that we shall make a few
enemies, not many, of course, but a tow among the mi»
nority of those who tail to adjust themselves to society
This would indeed be unlortunatc, and it shall he our
ditty carefully to avoid such a situation whenever pos-
sihle,

In taking over the management of the SCARLET AND
BLACK at this time, we are faced with the problem
of student government reorganization, Developments to
date toward a reorganization have been in line with the
suggestions advanced through this column. it is the i ~
teiition ot the new management to assume an active i ,
terest in this question and be governed in its attitude by
the editorial board alone.

. Nor is the reorganization of student government the
only question which the editorial board must cope with
Some time in the near future, we have good reason to
think within the next month, Griunell must readjust liel‘
athletic policy. It is our since wish that the SCARLET
AND BLACK may be of some service, and it is our inten-
tion to advocate an aliiliation with a neuterehcc that will
insure a continuation of an athletic policy that has me
trailed in the past, one that has placed Grinnell deﬁnitely
on the athletic map,

It shall be the policy of this department to give each
question an impartial consideration and then make a
definite stand. We can best conduct this column with the
cooperation of the !acnlty and students This is your pa-
per: May we conduct it to the best advantage and to-
ward a bigger and better Gl'innelL
