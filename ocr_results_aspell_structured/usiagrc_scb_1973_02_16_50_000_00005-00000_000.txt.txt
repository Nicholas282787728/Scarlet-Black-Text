Come Back,

by lack nnppelt

SGA had not had a gig in months,

Here it was, the hero-of those
swashbuckling student power days,
roaming the streets, disheartened,
enervated, and dispossessed. Re-
views in the papers were condemn—
ing. students, who had once looked
up in admiration to SGA and all it
stood for, were not even bothering
to stop by and vote.

Why, in its heyday, SGA used to
pack’em in. The famous student
strike scene in 1970, its unforgett—
able role in “Abolishing Requirer.
ments.” But those days were past.

SGA knew that if it didn't regain
the confidence of its people soon,
it was all over. It recalled other
troopers who had valiantly clung
as long as they could, only to go
under the hard way. There was
the free store, the Save the Wom-
en’s Gymmets, and the Alpha Sig-
ma Sigmasi Determined to ignite
a comeback, SGA decided to get a
new agent and change its image.

The next day it appeared at the
firm of Cy Nimmup b Sons; Pub—
licity Agents.

“Come right in,” chimed Mr. Nimr
mup, wearing a dollar suit and puf-
ting on a $200 cigar. “I must say,
you sure look pale. Rough season,
i‘ll bet?”

”To Say the least,” answered the
dejected SGA.

“I know your problem. Seen it a
thousand times. The public just
don’t buy your act no more, right?
First off, your names all wrong.”

“Why, what’s wrong with ‘SGA'?
It's easy to remember, stands out
in print, and great in slogans. How
about, ‘Students’ Rights Today,
Count on SGA?”

“Listen, kid. What's it standfor?"

“Student Government Associa-
tion."

“There’s your problem. Student,
nowadays, they don’t want to be
governed, least of all by other slur

Clarification

Weil: Approach

To the Editors:

1 wish to clarify an inadvertent
misrepresentation of my qualifica-
tions for the office of SGA Presi-
dent which appeared in last week’s
ShB. The article reported, “Well
also has SGA experience from his
term as Assistant Student Coordin-
ator last year.” The only positive
qualification 1 can claim from that
experience is my perception ofwhat
is wrong with SGA as it now stands.

My candidacy represents a more
vital role for SGA next year. I
want to make the student represen-
tative body the advocator of student
rights aginast encroachments from
any and all sides,

I seek the oltice with a more
important qualification. Last sums
mer I worked full time for a Saul
Alinsky organization in Chicago, Ci,
tizens Action Program. From obte
aining an Alinsky education I claim
my strongest qualification/a sys-
tematic approach to the implimens
tation of my platform.

All the candidates will probably
be advocating the same points. We
will all support strong student ri—
ghts in academic aiiairs, a more
positive social atmosphere, and re—
vitalizing reforms for SGA. The V07
ters must therefore be concerned
not merely with the basic issues
but more importantly the manner
in which the candidate plans to im—
pliment his platrorm,

dents. When was the last time you
governed? Did you set the rules
for dorm hours, library hours, cam-
pus food, class size? 1 mean, do you
really make them rules?”

“Well, no, but we're indispen-
sable...”

“No, Pez is indispensable. You,
you’re just another formality that
your public don’t have time for.
Less than half of them vote in your
elections. And they look right past
you when any crisis erupts. While
you’re hohnobbing with the admin-
istration, they want action. Youever
heard of John Lewis. Alinsky, Gan-
dhi’! They knew who they represenr
ted and they lught for what they
believed their group deserved,”

"Yes, but this is a college. We’re
not here tor a power struggle, we're
here to learn. Part of my job is
to listen to all sides and then ."

“Listen, kid, Let me level with
you. You ain't got no ongoing pow»
er struggle, but when the students
know that they're getting the short
end on some problems, you belong
up there fightin' for ‘em. lfyou’re
a mediator, you ain‘t doing any~
body any good. The administration
won’t think you represent any can
hesive force and the students won’t
even let you speak attheir meetings.
Don't worry about controlling the
students. There’s plenty of pressure
on them from all sides; professors,
the administration, grad schools,
work loads, parents.”

“But how do I know what students
Want, they're not all alike.”

“That’s funny, you seem to think
you know what the faculty believes
or the administration or the truss
tees, and they ain't all alike. You’re
elected by the students to represent
them. If you can’t figure out what
they want then you don’t belong
there. And you don’t need no ref-
erendum to find out, If you can't
take it, get out of the business."

“Okay, so what about my name?
What should I do with that?”

“Change it. How about to ‘Student
Advocate?’ Maybe that’d bring back
the public. But remember, they
won’t just flock back. You gotta
show them something."

"I don’t know. Student Advocate,
SA. That just won't work, that at)-
breviation’s already being used.”

"Then change that too. And come
back next Tuesday after the elec—
tion. That’s all I can do for you
now."

differences, however, lowa State
ISPIRG leaders did formally with-
draw funds from the organization.

The group at lowa State intends
to keep functioning as a campus
organizations, according to Ms.
Wynn, operating under the name oi
ISU-ISPIRG and concentrating on
student»oriented issues.

Problems with the regular collec-
tion of funds stem from confusion
over collecti procedures and a
lack of publi ity about local and
state ISPIRG activities, Ms. Wynn
told the SLE. At Grinnell, for er
ample, ISPIRG collected only $143
from 94 students who contributed
to ISPlRG while paying their tuition
bill. for the Semester. An additional
$100 was collected at tables near
dining halls during the early weeks
of the semester. ‘Last semester
lSPIRG collected over $700 at
Grinnell.

Ms. Wynn hopes that the lSPlRG
group at the University of Iowa
may develop an eiiective col.
lection system this semester and be
able to help the group financially
next year, in which case the staff
could be expanded once again,

one of the most indefinable. and
intriguing, student organizations on
campus this year is the Scarleteers
and Tanngers. Almost everyone has
heard of them, and almost no one
knows exactly what they are. Even
the members themselves aresome-
times unsure, for the character of
the group changes each year. The
only consistent fact is that S (it T
is the only non—iacultyesupervised
musical group on campus.
Scarleteers developed as an unui-
ficial offshoot of the Men's Glee
Club in 1957. Tanager-5 came later,
and both groups were pictured in
the 1961 yearbook. The college catar
log described them as a ”women's
(men‘s) vocal octet", and there is
no sign that the groups worked toe
gather in presenting programs. Both
groups were intent upon producing
light concerts Of folk and popular
music, and the Scarleteers were
well-known for their barbershop
harmonies. 1965 was a peak year
for Scarleteers, ior they staged a
highly technical concert in ARH,
and even cut a record, That year
also marked the first official 35,
sociation of females with the group:
A crew or girls in “leotards and
long black dancing hose" introduc-
ed the songs which the Scarleteers
sang.

By 1969 S KI. T were closely 35,

Iowa State group centered primare
ily around differences of opinion
regarding the direction of the
group’s activities, Ms Wynn told
the 5&8. ”They think that students
are interested only in issues that
directly confront them and not in
issues of public interest,” She Said.
The state board, on the other hand,
believes that the organization should
concentrate on broader public in-
terest-oriented issues concerning
groups other than students alone,

The state board has decided not to
undertake legal action against the
lowa State group. Ms. Wynn said,
because “the gain could not be
worth the expense ” The door IS
therefore open for ISUVISPIRG to
return to the organization any time
it wishes.

Ms. Wynn terms herself ”realis-
tically optimistic" about the future
of ISPIRG. “lSPlRG can die next
month or it can lastforevel', depend-
ing on how much Students want to
get involved," she said. This he—
comes more Significant now that
there is no professional stafftotrlke
care of many of the pl‘olects. But
even more important, she added,
is that “the state board become
more active so that students will
know What we are dolng,"

”That’s the only thing that is
going to save it.”

The Scartateers and Tanagers

sociated in presenting concerts.
since then, the groups have changed
quite a bit in character. Men and
women both regard themselves as
just one group, and there are now
only ten members altogether. With
a proliferation of diversified talent
among the members, thegeneralat—
tltude is that, well, we'll try any
style of music at least once. The
result is everything from Kinston
Trio to Carole King, from Beach
Boys to Swingle singers, from Tam»
my Wynette to James Taylor. Not
only do all the members sing, but
each has a special instrumentaltal—
eht as well: guitar, banjo, double
bass, piano, flute, kazoo, tambourr
ine, spoons, 0r washboard
