- on Thursday a team ofscicntists originating from Ger-
many and France found evidence that supports the claim
that newbo'rns cry in their native language. The team
recorded 2,500 cries of newborns between two and ﬁve
days old from both Germany and France. The scientists
desired to extend the current ﬁndings that describe what
sounds babies can perceive and test what sounds they cm,
ate. The team found that the pitch of the crying baby var»
ied based upon the language being spoken. For example,
French babies etied “with a rising melody contour" while
German babies‘ cries had a "falling melodic contour,”
Before this study was conducted, scientists believed that
babies were not capable of vocal imitations prior to 12
weeks orage.
