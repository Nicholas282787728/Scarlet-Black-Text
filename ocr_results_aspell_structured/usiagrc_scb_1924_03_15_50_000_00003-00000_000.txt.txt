Spirited Open Forum Discussion
Follows Beloit. Debate on
Harding Proposal.

The quadrangular debate, held an—
nuaily between Knox, Beloit, Carleton,
and Griunll. was held at the tour
schools last night The question.
“Resolved That the United States
should enter the World court under
the terms proposed by President Hard-
ing," was used in each contest.

' The Grinnell negative team, comr
posed of John Talbott, Eugene nrieten—
bach, énd Junior Wood, met the Knox
atlirmative at Knox, while the local
affirmative, John McGee, James Work,
and Paul rorter, argued with the
_Beloit negative near-inneu. Simul—
taneously Knox's negative team de-
bated at Carleton, and Carleton's neg-,
ative at Beloit, completing the iour‘

Loyal Shift Case

The debate here was marked by the
ability of the local team to shiit its‘
case to an unexpected atmch by the
Beloit arguers. Aside from McGee's
well prepared opening 5D8ech, the
entire afﬁrmative argument was im-
promptu, which fact was keenly ap-
preciated by the small audience. Work,
making his initial appearance on the
varsity platlorm, and Porter a third
year debater, did excellent work in,
their extemporizredispeechesl '

The Beloit team, composed of Orton
Hotter, Norval Myers, and Roger Tub
trup, appeared to have a slight ad»
vantage over the locals in the con-
structive speeches, but failed to tear‘
down the Grinnell defense 'in their
rebuttal arguments. Both teams ap-
peared to good advantage on the plat-
torm. the Grinnelllans having some~
what greater ease, and more effectivsl
delivery.

Audience Judges Contest:

According to an argument between
the speech departments of Beloitl
and Grinnell, an audience judgment, so
far new to Grinnell, was taken. Ber
lieving that the true test of the el-
fectiveness of speaking lies in the re-
action of the audience, the schools
prepared .a threefold ballot for each‘
member of the audience.

Belore the debate star-ted, every
bearer mulled his opinion, either for
or against the entrance of the United
States into the World Court. At the
close of the debate each one repeated
the process, thus showing the change
in opinion produced by the discus
sion. 'Of the eighteen who turned in
their ballots, seven had been convert
ed from the negative to the alfirm~
ative, one trend the affirmative to the
negative, while ten had not changed
their views on the subject.

In the regular vote or the audience,

In Home Concert, “Silver Bells
And Cockle Shells” Will
Be Headliner.

The Women's Glee club will present,
in their home concert, to be given on

and Cockle shells." This is a de-
parture from the usual custoln, and
will be included as a number of the

“Silver Bells and Cockle shells" '~
a fantasy in the form oi a play w u
music, based on Mother Goose rhymes.
The characters are the Crooked Mon,
Mistress Mary, Little Boy Blue, and
old King Cole and his Fiddlers Three,
as they appear to a little girl in a
dream, brought down by the fireflies,
just as her lather had told her they
they would. A very fanciful plot is
evoked from the \‘ztl'ious happenin
as they are recounted ill the well
known iingles of old Mother Goose
and the dialogue is delightfully clever
and witty.

choruses Composed of Fireﬂies

The musical numbers are solos, en—
sembles and choruses, for the most
part.orlginal settings of the Mother
Goose rhymes, and other lyrics. The
choruses are composed of fireflies, the
little maids of Mistress Mary, and the
black birds, who were baked into a
pie without impairing their tunefula
ness. The instrumental numbers are
a prelude, based, on the theme of the
Fiddlers
Three, and the epilogue, also evolved
train the theme of the fireflies.

The text is by Robert Y. Kerr, and

the music by Elias Blum. The work
