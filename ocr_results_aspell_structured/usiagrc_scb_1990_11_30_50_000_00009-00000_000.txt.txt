I iverse Feminist Art

By Rina Khan

The current art exhibition at the
Grinnell Community Art Gallery
presents works by members of the
central Iowa chapter of the
Women’s Caucus for Art. The
exhibitionoffersancxcttingvar‘icty
of works in differing media, and
since there is no unifying theme,
eachartistisable to makeapersonal
statement through her work on the
issues lhataremostimportant to the
individual artist,

The Women's Caucus for Art is
a naLional organization that has a

Iowa chapter has 30 members, iii-
cluding local artists Merle Zirkle
and Karin Connolly.

Among the many sculptures on
display, Zirkle’s characteristically
elegant works with lheir highly ren

curves of“Fttmin Burden" adds to
the symbolism of this wood piece.

Similarly, Rosemary Lehman’s
“Waltz ofthe Eagles" hasa fluidity
of movement in its graceful arcs of
uminum mounted on a base of
marble. May Disney‘s “Don‘tGet
Any Ideas” is an innovative piece
that consists of a partially opened
‘lack/ drawer full of bullons with
thcinscnpuon“don'tgctanyideas".

On top of the drawer is a yellowed
piece of paper stating the Univer-
sity of Iowa's policy on sexual
Itarrassment. The artistthus makes
a powerful statnicnt through a
silnple arrangement of objects,

Linda Roethke‘s “Living with
Shame“ is a particularly powerlul
piece in the exhibition. This charA
coal drawtng convey forcefully,
throughthcuscofcurvilincarfortns
in £1 black background, an acute
senseofdcspairandsuffering. The
net-like lines of the faceless female
figurescvokeihoideaofthewomnn
being u'apped in her shame.

AnneGochenour’s“ElueBear"
is striking due to its content. It
consists of a blue teddy mounted
onto a muslim prayer mat. (in
muslim households a prayer that is
treated With a great deal of venera-
tion). A visitor to the exhibition
found this extremely offensive and
remarked that respect for other re-
ligions and cultures should also be
important for these artists who
themselves wish to be treated with
respect for their achievements in
the arts.

There are numerous other art
works ofhigh quality in this exhibi-
tion that are both thought provok-
ing and visually stimulating, i
would encourage anyone who has
the time to see for themselves the
richness and variety of this in-
Lrlgulng exhibition.

Mark Shepard's Modern
Folk Rock Featured on
Feather on the Wind

By John Reed

Mark Shepard is a singer/
ongwriter/guitaristfrom Peeksidll,
N.Y. His music is of the “hard to
cubhyholcmtxlem" folk rock genre.
In other words it is kind of the style
of Sinead O’Connor, Tracy

album released on his independent
label, Scarecrow Records. Itis a
studio recording featuring Shepard
on vocals. acoustic guitar and syn—
niesizerJtalsofeaturesGeneMoore
onbackupvocals,elecricguirarand
bass.

Shepard's guitar playing is ex-
cellent, and all threemusicans work
well together. Shepard is also a
top-notch songwriter as Feather on
the Wind clearly demonstrates.
Most of his songs are pertinent
renderings of modern life in
America. The opening song
“Walls" speaks of the various
meanings and values people have
assigned to wallsincluding LheViet
nam Memorial and the Berlin Wall;
thetitlesong“Fealheron theWind”
speaks of an adult child of an air
cohollc facing the reality of her
father’s alcoholism: “All the
Money‘s Gone” addresses
homelessness.

Shepard has managed to address
these issues without getting cheezy
(a pretty remarkable featl)r Other
songs deal with such topics as love
and personal strength.

For anyone who’s into the folk
rock kinda thing, Feather on the
Wind is worth ordering, Write to:

a widely diverse exhibit that is of

highly modern and usually pron

Freshman Nrtngle describes his
work as two different kinds: that
which he finds aesthetically pleasr
lng,andthutwhiclimttkesltpoltucal

be the best way to categorize this
exhibit. which ranges from paint-
ings and collage to sculpture and
computer printout.

The works that could possibly
be categorized as “aesthetic" all

is devoted to that which ntztkes
a political or social statement.
Much of this is of a sexual
nature, and reﬂects the object-
ification of women (as in, of
course, “The objectification of
Women"),homophobtaantlpolttlcs
(inthecontrovcrslal“PcnisEnvy"),
and other matters of a sexual na-
lurc. as in “Women in Search of a

NervousOrgasm"and“Dangcrous

vulva,

Other works focus on technoln

ogy, such as “Bones Licked Clean

by the WindsofProgrcss"and“.lob
638 (The (1051701)," which show
the technificauon of the gospel, or
ianiVidualism. as in “One Out of
Many."

Image Virus 124 is not npretty
exhibition, nor is it relaxing. It
would have probably been banned
elsewhere, and even in Grinnell,
there have been complaints atsome
of the more sensitive matter.
Looking atsomc of the works. it is
easy to see why. With an open
mind, however, the exhibit is well

intriguing and fascinating.
