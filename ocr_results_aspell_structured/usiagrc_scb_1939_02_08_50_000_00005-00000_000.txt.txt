MANb HOP
Bil Andre Mall'ttttx, translated
from the French by Stuart

Gilbert mid Alttstttit Mac—

Donald. Rttlttlmn House.
In this novel of the Spanish tivu
war. according to the descriptions
on the Jacket, Mali-aux “grants
the reader no mercy." The warn»
ing is hardly fair. ”Man’s Hope'
is written in an extremely realis-
tic prose, but one feels that Mal»
rank is making no attempt to
nauseate his readers.

The Violence with which the
book is filled Is qlute bearable
because of the objective manner
in which it is described: unlike
Hemingway or Erich Remarque,
Malraux writes in the third per-
son aiid thus avoids the usual
lurid sensationalisni of war
stories.

Malraux has seen the Spanish
war, but he has purposed to set
down more than the externals of
what he has seen. The characters
are not so often the bewildered

nlilicanes as the leaders of thei

conflictAacLing. but thinking as
well, and expressing themselves.

None of them come alive for
very long. but Malraux is
writing of character either, ex-
cept as war inﬂuences it, He
is trying to give not merely a
picture but an exposition of what
is going on in Spain.

He gives it through the eyes of
peasants, bombers. generals. joul'r
nalists, artists, and priests; of
Spaniards, Frenchmen, ltalians,
and Americans: of liberals and
fanatics.

The hope he has found. the hope

of fraternity, is the theme which‘

rccurs throughout the rhapsodic
crashing of the conflict; the vari-
ations are written in for 'us, and
we arc left to experience our own
reactions.

It is time that someone has at-
tempted an exposition of the
Spanish conflict; and it is fol'tullv
ate that it is Malraux who has
chosen to make the attempt. He
has written a remarkable novel,
if not a hail'rl‘alsmg onc. Anyone
looking for a good horrible war
story or an argument for paci-
fisin had better go back to “All
Quiet on the Western Front."

Track Coach Plans
To Take Nine Men
To Illinois Meet

By Clark A. Smith.

Coach a. Lester Duke is planning
to take a squad of eight or nine
thin-clads to the Illinois relays,
Feb 18,

In addition to men to run in
the individual events, Duke will
enter a medley relay team and
possibly a mile or two-mile team
in the college class of competi-
tion.

Eleven entries .have been sent
in, but Duke says he does not at
pect to take that number.

“A lot will depend on the form
some of the men will show in
practice this week." he explained
"So far, I haven‘t been satis ed
with the showing of anyone in
particular, but we need the coni-
petition to ﬁnd out how we
stand"

Thosc entered for the meet at
Cllampaign are Ted Applequist
in the 75-yard dash, Frank Pfoh!
in the high and low hurdles and
the high jump, Burke Powers in
the broad jump and low hurdles.
and Paul Baichly in the high hur-
dies.

On the medley team, Duke has
listed Robert Hagan for the 440.
William Pederscn for the' half,
Harold Secgal‘ for the thlee-

fourth mile, and NeumAh Fell for:
the mile.

The Pioneer track mentor says
he is not sure about his mile
team but he has entered Robert
Granny. Raymond Crossman, l-la-
gan, Fedetsell and George Finck
all for that event.

The two milc team is undecid-
ed, but it would be made up of
some of the middle distance mcn
already mentioned.

In order. to avoid the plague of
sore legs mm the tiny track in
the basement of the men‘s gym-
nasium, Coach Duke is refraining,
from running his men in time
trials.

He frankly admits that this is
a gamble. because he cannot be
sure of what they will do in
competition.

Saturday four of the squadmen
journeyed to Des Moines for works
outs in the Drake fieldhouse. Cos
captain Veni Robinson and Ed-
ward Walters both had their first
opportunity to pole vault at that
time.

Pfohl and Powers also had then-
first chance to stretch [heix'legs
over a flight of hurdles and to
check on the high-jump and
broad-jump, rcspectively.
