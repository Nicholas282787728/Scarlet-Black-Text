ENGLAND HAS CONFERRED
MANY HONORS FOR WORK

International Fame Has ' Been
Heeped Upon Grenfeil for
Services.

In recognition of hi remarkable
services to humanity, distinguished
honors have been conl'e cd upon
Dr. Wilfred T. orenfell, who lec-
tllres here on "Midst Snow and Ice
in Labrador," Friday, March. 5, at
8:00 p. m. at Herrick chapel as
the next attraction on the lecture
course.

The English Government conferr-
ed upon him the Order of Campan-
ion of St: Michael and St. George.
Oxford University gave him the only
honorary M. D. which that univen
sity has ever bestowed. He has
been made a Fellow of the Royal
College of surgeons of England; a
Fellow of the American College of
Surgeons; 'he is one of the few
doctors of medicine holding a Mass
ter Mariner’s certificate; Harvard
has given him its honorary M. A.;
Williams its honorary LLB; and
Toronto an honorary M. D. A few
years ago the Royal Geographical
Society gave him the Murchison Be-
quest in recognition of his scientific

labors.

Athlete in Conegc.

It is interesting to check back
over the milestones in the busy life
of Dr. Greniell. Truly he is man
who has lived ahead of his time.
Thirty years ago in England he Tees
ognized the value of athletics as an
influence in religious life. Not only
did he recognize this value. but he
put it into practical operation—long.
before Y. M. C. ANS had ever been
dreamed of. While at Oxford he
starred in all athletic pursuits and'

urchins from the London slums. He}
progressed rapidly in his lneIliCELl
Work and through constant associ
tion with the leading medical fig-
ures of England he soon became;
famous in the profession. He real-I
ized. however, the much larger and
more satisfactory fields of service
among the folks Elf the outside who
did not have the very things which
he was peculimly equipped to give
them. It was this inspiration of
service that led him first to take
Ill) ,his work in the Northern seas.

He has lectured all Over England,
all over Canada. and in many of the
largest cities of the United States
during the past fifteen years; in
fact, just as Often as he could slip
away from his manifold duties in
the Nolth. In addition to estah~
lishing tbe co-opel‘ative stores, many
of which are successfully uperatlng
today, he built numerous schools
and founded the now famous Gren—
feil Children’s Home. He built the
first mills in the Northland, estab<
lished a large fox farm, the first ex-
pel'llnented. With the raising of rein-
deer shipping three hundred heads
from Lapland. in 1993. ’He even
built the first lighthouse for the
fishermen of the country.

A Man of International Fame.

AS may readily he.guessed, Dl‘.
Grenfell's lecture is the story of llls
work in the Northiand—a story of
accomplishment over seemingly in~
surmountable difficulties in hiring-
ins happiness, health and life tn the
poor, plain inhabitants Uf_ the Labra-
dor coast. It is a drama of the
life of the Northland which has won
the hearts of nations. His has been
a life of service in the Labrador
country but not there alone. He
has also made his contribution in
the North seas, in France. England.
and America. His has been a life
of serious effort to make new men
as new bodies. His appearance here
should mark an important event in
local circles, for he is a figure of
international fame, undoubtedly the
most universally known figure who
has spoken on a Grinnell platform
this year. He gives a wnorlerfully
human lecture which brings the epic
story of the Northlcnd to us with
all of its fresh and rugged charm.

OF “THE F

AMOUS MRS. FAIR”

 

The Griimell College Dramatic Club
took a bald step when it advertised
that “The Famous ll . Fai " would
be presented by an all-star cast. Col.
lege students are not usually recog—
nized as stars, at least of the ﬁrst.
magnitude. but the Dramatic Club
proved to the theatergocrs of Grim.
ncll last Saturday night that there
were stars in its midst. In fact the
cast was so well balanced that we
would not even permit the ilidiscl'e~
tion of flipping a coin to see him the
real star might be.

And the Dramatic Club had picked
it play of the ﬁrst. order for the delec-
talion of the audience which braved‘
the rain Saturday night to see “Tlle‘
Famous Mls. Fair." Although this
play was written for and acted by
two sta , it did net'dcvelcp two stars l

The Pioneers lost their final bas-
‘Iiethztll game of the season here last
Saturday night to the Kansas Ag-

ntes of play. At the end of the
first. half the score stood '18 to 13
for the Scarlet and Black team.

The game was of no importance
in the conference standings. as

have changed the results in the per

of the two teams resulted in a 35—

Dirty Play at Times.

Numerous fouls and attempts at
ldil'ty play marred the spirit of the
contest, and detlitcted considerably
irom the real interest of the game.

Grinnell went into the lead soon
after the game started, and con.
tinued to roll up points during the
,eatire first half. The Grinnell play-
lers seemed to have their basket eye
which won so handily for them at
Manhattan in the other same, and
rolled in seyeral sensational shots.
The contributors to the scoring in
this period were- Critchett and
Whitehill with two baskets each,
Gelvln with one, and Benz with
eight free throws. During this half

The positions offered vary from

the company, it is necessary for the’

possible for a college man to start
