Shallow but fun docu-
mentary about expletive

Why watch the documentary Fuel,
a diverting, quick-paced ﬁlm ce'lehrat-
ing the versatility ofthat most offensive
of terms? The dated footage of rising
politician George W. Bush giving the
camera the ﬁnger would alone make
it worth your_timct But that’s not the
only moment of delightful hypocrisy
and inappropriateness in this entertain~
ing, ifshiillow, movie.

Featuring commentary from a
spectrum ofindividualsilinguists. cor
medians, rappers, journalists, conserva:
tives, liberals, porn stars and Pat Boone
(serving a vital purpose as Uptight Old
White Man)—thc rilm erplores the
history, uses and societal impact of the
pervasive profanity Some of the re—
maihs are genuinely insightful, while all
are hilarious, it’not always intentionally
so (it. whenever Alan Keyes opens his
pompous mouth).

The main issue discussed is, of
course, free speech. And while .liuse
rraring a number of disturbing trends
towards ccnsmship, the movie rails to
provide complete eoveiage of any con-
trovelsy. The portrayals or both sides
tend toward onesdimcnsional stereos
types without offering much new infor
mation: the heroic libeial artist avant—
garde can't get enough “tuck"wlnle the

Amendment. Interesting arguments,
like the comparison between Aineiican
“Utah and its moie peimissive Euro-
pean counterpart, are quickly suggested
and then even sooner dropped.

While weak on substantial en-
lightening debate, Fuel is entertaining
nonetheless. And with the interjection
being joyously uttered over 800 times,
how could the film not be (almost) as
much fucking fun as the word itself?

COURTESY ti'rrr: //Josi_o.coivi

Diramgii'lr does have its ﬂows. The
second half or the film moves away a
little too much from Effie, who is the
heart, soul and c/szpn/l of the ﬁlm.
Furthermore, the movie suffeis from
what shall henceforth he lmn‘wn as
the “MTV Music Video Syndrome."
wherein no particular shot in any scene
lasts for longer than about seven sec-
onds, killing a great deal of potential
emotional gravity.

ovcrill, Borough/r does not dist
appoint It is funny when it wants to
be, and powclful when it has to be. It
won't change the way we think ahcur
musicals, but as James “Thunder" Early
puts it, “you can fake your way to the
top "
