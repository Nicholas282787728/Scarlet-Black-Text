Don’t change grades

Grades seem to be an unending source of controversy on
this campus.

Since J. B. Grinnell founded the college, there have been
nine separate grading systems used Most were variations on
the traditional A through F scale, although some used
percentages and others assigned a numerical figure instead
of a letter.

NOW, DEAN 0F the College Waldo Walker is proposing
that the system be changed again. He made the proposal in a
memo distributed to the faculty over winter break which
accompanied a questionnaire about the grading system,

Another proposed change in the system may not excite
many people. ‘In fact, Don Smith, Chairman of the history
department, says he ﬁnds the subject tedious. “I’ve been
through so many grade changes in my career," Smith said,
“that I’ve lost interest in grading systems as a way of in-
ﬂuencing behavior.”

GRADES, HOWEVER, are a vital concern to the student
body, And in this era, when competition for jobs and
graduate school openings has become particularly intense,
grades have become an increasingly powerful inﬂuence on
student behavior.

Walker's survey provides some insight into how the
system may be changed. A major target for reformers is the
erase option, which deletes any grade below a D from a
student's transcript.

ULTIMATELY, WALKER argues, the erase option ”has
had an insidiously negative effect on the student’s im-
pression of how successful she or he is” and is largely
responsible Ior grade inﬂation at Grinnell, He said some
students have even withdrawn from a class to avoid
receiving a B. '

There is some truth in what Walker says. Students, of
course, shouldn‘t assess their academic progress solely in
terms of grade point average, Credit and distribution
requirements are important too.

YET, THE EXISTENCE of credit requirements prevents
most students from capriciously dropping courses. In fact,
an average Grinnell student, taking 16 credits per semester,
can only drop one course and still satisfy the 124 credit
requirement.

The present system also might not be completely fair.
Smith believes the current system punishes those who stay
in a class where they are getting poor grades and rewards
those who quit early in order to protect their GPAI This, as
Smith puts it, is “just plain unfairl"

BUT ELIMINATING the erase option would pose
problems as welli One such problem would be an increase in
the amount of academic pressure as students found themsel»
ves locked into courses in which they were doing poorly,

More importantly, adding an F would discourage many
students from taking courses in subject areas where they
lacked confidence in their abilities.

EXPOSURE TO A wide variety of fields, as some con-
stantly argue, is the essence of a liberal arts education,
During a time when many faculty members are concerned
that students are going through Grinnell without actually
receiving a true “liberal arts” education, it is odd they would
favor a grading system which would discourage students
from fulfilling the liberal arts ideal.

The current grading system, obviously, is not perfect. In
some areas, as Smith argues, it is unfair. But the plan to add
an F and eliminate the erase option will create more serious
problems than it would solve,

Letters to the editor

Charges Dean’s List invades privacy

To the Editor:0nce again the
college has seen fit to publish the
Dean’s List, Not only was the list
published, but ll was published in
the Campus Memo for everyone lo
see.

I [all to see the purpose in
publishinglhis lisl, r was under the
impression that, as a residential
college, Grinnell sought to create a
sense of community and
togetherness among its students.

I ALWAYS REGARDED the
absence of sororities and frater-
nities as evidence that no student
should be separated as “better”
than any other. I had hoped inr
Stitutfonal elitism was foreign to
Grinnell. . .

Bul. I guess the college has
decided elitism is a good tiling.
Perhaps it feels the Dean’s List
will make students more comr
petilive. After all, “gotta be best”
competition is such a healthy trait
to instill in young adults.

PUBLISHING THE Dean's List
is no great favor to those appearing
on it. Those lucky few find them-
selves alienated from most of the
student body. It’s embarrassing in
be declared ”better” than friends,
particularly when you know lhe
truth of the matter.

A third point: It seems to me the
privacy of those whose names are
included on the list has been in»
vaded. It‘s no one's business
whether I am one of the best
students, academically, at Grin-
nell. The present structure lets
everyone see exactly who these
“superior” students are

JUST AS IMPORTANTLY, if I
am not one of the top academic
performers, the whole campus
knows ll. Again, my privacy has
been violated,

Some may argue that
academically superior students
oughi to be recognized, While I
disagree, let’s assume I agree.
Even if we accept the hypothesis

Meeting costly

trustees stopped meeting in places
like Scottsdale, Arizona we
wouldn’t have to raise our luilion

that academically superior
sludenls deserve recognition, we
slill have ihe problem of privacy.

WHY NOT ASK each student
who qualifies for the Dean’s Lisl.
whether he or she wants to be in-
cluded on the published list? This
way those who deserve and want
recognition can get it. Those who
choose to avoid recognilion may do
so. The problem of privacy is
eliminated because those who are

listed have chosen lo reveal their
academic ability, and exclusion
from the published listing indicates
nothing about one's academic
standing,

I know I gel. bad feelings inside
every time I see the Dean's List in
the Campus, l\,|crno.,_l hope enough
of you feel the sam'ewayso we can
avoid seeing it again. Steve

Health fee too high

To the editor: The student health
service requires a $15 fee. I was
.loldat registration [habitthat fee
wasn't charged the cost would
have to be added to the tuition, But
I could not register uniil I had paid
that fee. In effect then it was pan
of the tuition. I feel that this fee
should either be incorporated into
the tuition and not given a separate
listing or made optional. Making it
an optional fee is actually more

logical. Then those students who
wish to use the service the health
,centelfgfferslwouldustill ,be able to,
’and thosewho'don'l Wish to use/the
service wouldn’t ‘ be charged,
Fifteen dollars is an exhorbitant
price to pay for a servrce you don't
use. It is in fact a useless service.
They can’t prescribe medication or
do anything that l myself cannot
do. A service like that should be
optional. Sandra Lee Miller.
