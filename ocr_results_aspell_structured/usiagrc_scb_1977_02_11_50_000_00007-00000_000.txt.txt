the Carls at home twice as part of a
league plan to help Carleton avoid
lengthy road trips,

Peterson on the second matchup.

The Pioneers did play well.
Although the shooting percentage
was lower than the night before,
the team got off 21 more shots. The
team also had fewer turnovers
than the Carls, the first time this
year Grinnell has beaten an op
orient in this category.

surprised at the determination and
spirit of the Pioneers. He added

.500 record,

 

Last Tuesday, the Pioneers
came home with the hope oi
breaking into the win column but
fell to the Tigers from Iowa
Wesleyan, 89-77.

well in the first half and were able
to keep up with the fast-moving
Tigers, As the half came to a close,
the Tigershad only a twopoint
lead.

The second half was an all-too»
familiar story for the Pioneers.
After starting well, the Pioneers
lost some steam and the visitors
opened up the game.

A bright spot for Grinnell was its
defensive play for a large part oi
the night. Bill Knox and Gunnar
Thors excited the crowd with
blocked shots and good reboun-
ding.

Cagers playing better

team was handily deieated by the
Central JV. Graceland varsity and

provement it has made since the
beginning of the season.

The contest at Central on Feb. I
ended in an 8532 victory ior the
host. Stephanie Nelson led the
pioneers with 14 points. At home
versus Graceland's varsity last
Friday, Grinnell was defeated, 74-

points respectively

The next day against the Luther

JV the Pioneers scored the most
points ever tallied by a Grinnell
women’s basketball team as they

excellent game. For instance, in a
two and a half minute period, they
reduced a l4rpomt deficit to six.
Krutilla and Anne Harrison each
scored seven points in the first
half. The second stanza began
slowly as Laura Burrows's field

Humble volleyball start

hyTimCavcr

The Grinnell club volleyball
team, which must be considered a
club rather than a team
representing the college because it
receives no~money from the
athletic department, opens its

' a1 season tomorrow. It will
p rticipatc in a round»rcbin
tournament at Macomb, 111.,
against Graceland, University of
Iowa and Western Illinois Coach
in Latimer's team will face at
e t one extremely tough
c allenge since Graceland won the
National Association of In
tercollegiate Athletics cham-
pionship last year,

Another challenge for Grinnell is
simply getting to the tournaments
it plays in and eating when it gets
there, The nnlycollege l'unding the
team received was $80 from the
Initiative Fund, All of this went for
admission to the North Central

Intercollegiate Volleyball Con.
ference. As a result, all travel
expenses must be borne by
Latimer and the team members.

According to the coach, con.
ditions at Grinnell are favorable to
starting a volleyball program
cheaply, For practices, the team
uses equipment from the women’s
squad For uniforms, the team will
use old intramural basketball
jerseys. A woman in town is sewmg
numbers onto the uniforms at no
charge.

Despite these humble begins
nings, Latimcr is optimistic, He
Stated. “We started out with fifty
guys in November on a workshop
basis ,. We now have sixtccn guys
who are committed volleyball
players ” This \veckcnd’s com.
petition will be valuable ex
patience for the team, since only
one team member has ever played
power volleyball before.

irony played its hand and dealt
Grinnell a victory as six schools,
including South Dakota State and
defending champ Kearney State,
had to watch from the wings as the
Pioneer women regained the
plaque they tirst won in 1975.

Itwas the breaststroke relay. the
next to last event. that provided the
ironic twist. A 1976 disqualification
ill that race cost the Pioneer
women the title. Kearney State
folded this time as its breaststroke
relay’s disqualification clinched
the win for the home team. Later.
Grinnell coach Mike Daley noted
that without the disqualification
his squad would not have emerged
victorious.

“Everyone swam their best
times or the year, even those
swimming two events in a row,"
stated Daley. Only two races were
Won by Grinnell, the ZDDryd. free
relay and the Sooryd breaststroke
relay. Cindy Smith, Nancy
DuTeau, Becky Chipman and
Sheryl Huntoon sprinted iast
enough to collect mugs for first
place in the former after Grinnell
had placed second in the previous
three events. Lynn Westley, Margo

A little more here and a few

after Grinnell finished second by

Saturday, Nine second places by

Grinnell while South Dakota State
finished third.

Three first place iinishes were
garnered by the Pioneers and three

Central Women's team will appear
but will not compete formally with
the Pioneers.

Men

The men will open their season
tonight by hosting Central, Mon-
mouthand Simpson at the PEG.
Field events will begin at a pm.
and running events at 7 p.m.
Central is expected to provide the
most competition for Grinnell, but
at this point in the season it is
difficult to predict the quality oi
opposing teams.

Grinnell's strengths this year,
like last year, appear to be cons
centrated in the field events, where
three potential stars will be
competing. Senior Lincoln Mar-
shall will lead the team in long and
triple jumping, while freshman
Toni Briles \vill jom sophomore
David Leech in the shot put.

Freshman Richard Nayer also
looks promising {or the Pioneers.
He will be running the two-mile
race this evening.

At this early point, Coach John
Pfitsch is unsure about the
prospects for his squad’s success.
“A lot oi the guys are practicing
outdoors. and I just don't know
what to expect from them,"
Pfiisch commented. “I'll know a
lot more after the meet.”

Grapplers place well

by Bob liicycr

Last Saturday, 13 teams come
peted in the Knox Invitational
Wrestling Tournament held in
Galesburg. Grinnell coach Mo
Hunt was hoping that the Pioneer
grapplers would finish among the
top five teams and his hope
became truth as the Pioneers
finished fourth, just a few points
behind the victors.

Three Grinnell wrestlers
finished highly in their weight
classes. Freshman Richard Lee
(158) and co-captain Gordon
Stacey i134) finished second in
their classes Both lost close
matches in the finals, losing by the
narrow margin oi 2-1.

The most pleasing spectacle ior
Hunt during the invitational was
the showing of Hosea Engram
Engram wrestled what Hunt called
“the best I have seen Hosea
wrestle in the four years I have
coached him," Engram won
his weights championship.

Hunt was also pleased by the
performances of Larry Cohen (177)
and Frank Corrigan (1550), despite
their inability to reach the semi-

finals, By the bad luck of the draw,
both grapplers were forced to
wrestle the number one seeds of
their classes in early matches.

in the last two tournaments,
Grinnell has finished fourth and
fifth Engram, Lee and Stacey
have Won their classes in one of
those two tourneys, These ex-
cellent periormances, which are
new to Grinnell wrestling, have
Hunt looking optimistically toward
the future and indicate that a few
Pioneer grapplers may be venr

iuring to Nationals.
