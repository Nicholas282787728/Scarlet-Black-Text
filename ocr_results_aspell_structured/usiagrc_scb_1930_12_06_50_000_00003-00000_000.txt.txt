Grmnell Gridiron Eleven Has
Five Victories, Four Losses;
Takes Fourth in Conference

Team Keeps Three Year Home Record Clear With Wins
Over Wesleyan, Creighton, Cornell, Teachers;

10 Play Last Game for Pioneers

By TED GLEYSTEEN
(Sporls Editor, The scarlet and Black)
Five victories, four defeats, and no ties comprise the record of the 1930

Grinnell college football team.

Grinnell’s bid for Missouri Valley conference honors fell short when the
Pioneers lost to both Drake and Washington. While Drake does not hold a
clear claim to the championship, the Bulldog record is slightly better than

that of the Oklahoma Aggies'.
over Creighton and Washington.

At first glance the season just clos- l

ed would Seem to be it rather dis-
couraging one, but when it is realized
that Grinnell's losses Were to teams
of the calibre of Marquette, Detroit,
and Drake, it is easy to understand
the final result. The schools that the
Pioneers conquered, while not out-
standing, still were formidable—Iowa,
Wesleyan, Carleton, Creighton, Cor-
nell, and State Teachers.
Hold Marquette Six Times

The scarlet and black in the first
game of the season defeated Iowa
Wesleyan without difficulty, 19 to 0,
but the next week found Grinnell bat»
tling a great Marquette team and. al—
though the Pioneer’s held their oppon»
ents six times from the goal line, the
seventh attack netted the Golden
Avalanche the six points that won
the game. The game against Detroit
was a heartbreaker. Detroit had lost
only two games in 22 starts and Grin—
nell proved easy, 47 to e. Drake
caught Grinnell tiring in the second
half and earned a 2M decision.

Not to. he discouraged by three
straight setbacks, the Pioneers swept
Creighton aside, 194:, and passed to a
14-13 Win over Carleton. Washington
university defeated Grinnell, 8 to o, in
a. listless game after Coach "Fuzz"
Watt-s men had juggled numerous op-
portun 'es to scare. Grinnell had lit-
tle difficulty with the next two
games, giving Cornell and Iowa State
Teachers, 12—3 and 12—0 lessons.

One valley dome Won

Grtnnell played four games at home
and won all of them, thereby keeping
'6. three year slate clean. Of the three
Missouri Valley conference games,
the Pioneers lost two and won one,
that from Creighton.

Injuries proved Grinnell's hoodco
all season. ‘ Russell Ruff, stellar
backfield man, missed the last three
games, and in the final encounter
with Teachers the Pioneers lacked
the services of (our regulars.

The 10 senior football men who
played their last game for Grinnell
in the Teachers fray, Nov. 21, were
Robert Bradford, Capt. Ben Douglas,
Robert Ferguson, Bell Hensley, Car-
leton Humphrey, Fred Norton, Royce
Minier, Russell Ruff, James Tipton
and Lowell Walker.
