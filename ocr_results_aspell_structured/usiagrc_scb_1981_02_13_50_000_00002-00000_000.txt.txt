DISSBGIIOII Ill'ﬂlle V8. the an

In the wake of the controversy over Ronald Reagan’s propos-
ed budget cuts we haven’t stopped to see through his actions.
Maybe he’s not only a product of conservatism but also of the
classical conditioning given by our society.

The first question asked a budding leader is “what changes
are you going to make?” Everyone expects sweeping reforms
to get rid of the old in favor of the new, Nobody suggests listen-
ing to age and reason; few offer any more than superficial in-
sights. Instead of giving a hand people advocate the easy and
colorful shortcuts.

Take Social Security; everybody knows our system is way out
of hand and at the same time Americans want the benefits their
parents enjoyed at age 65, But the idea of carefully correcting
inefficiences in the system isn‘t theatrical enough. A leader
needs to show power. So why not scrap SS and start over or cut
it back so it fails to function as originally intended?

Few people think about what this sort of mentality produces
but we’re starting to reach a point of diminishing returns.The
world isn’t getting any simpler so maybe it’s time to stop en<
couraging such simplistic policies. Maybe it’s time to push for
improving our government, time to really study how to “trim
the fat” and make our system work,
