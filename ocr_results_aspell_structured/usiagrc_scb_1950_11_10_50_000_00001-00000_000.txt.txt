WRA Disconfinues
Dance ln’rramural
Unfil Nex’r Year

The dance intramural, sched-
uled to be held in Darby gym,
November is, has been dropped
entirely from this year’s intra—
mural program. Although the
halls‘ dance chairmen had begun
work on it, the intramural was
cancelled because it was slated
so close to homecoming and
exams.

Postponement was out because
of the impossibility of using
Darby for dress rehearsals dur-
ing the basketball season. A la—
ter date was also not possible
because of semester exams.

The W.R.A. board put the
question to a vote in the wo-
men's halls Tuesday night, the
alternatives being either to have
the dance as scheduled or not
at all this year. The result was
four halls in iavor and four
halls against. Consequently, the
Dance intramural has been
dropped this year. plans are al-
ready made to schedule a bet-
ter date next year.

For the dance intramural,
each hall develops an interpre-
tive dance around an original
theme. The halls then give their
dances for the school, and com-
pete for the W.RA. trophy—

 

.won by head last year.
