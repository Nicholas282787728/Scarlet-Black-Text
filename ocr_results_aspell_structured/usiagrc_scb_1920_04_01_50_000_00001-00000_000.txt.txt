luul contemplated suicide and
had sworn her to secrecy as to his
intentions. Fill] particulars in the

next clliholl.

The body of J. D. Stoops, professor
of psychology. who has been missing
since Monday night. was found in the
notorious' "hole-inrtheground" at
Fourth and Broad Street: late this af-
ternoon. A note which was badly
damaged by water. was found on his
person and is the only explanation of
his actions.

Detectives Ted Gaunawry and Bobl
Hutchinson, of the Pinkerton Detec—
tive Agency were put on the case imv
mediatcly. By means ut the words
"martyr", “education" and “Ideas"
which were deciphered from the wa-
tw'soaketl nute they made the follow—
ing report: "Stoops Committed suicide
in order that he might communicate
his ideas to his classes and thus be-
come a martyr to education.”

It has been suspected that Professor
Stoops was a great believer in spirit

Professor Dudley David Griffith was shot and fatally wounded
this evening by Professor John Masson Smith following a quarrel
which the two had over Miss Helene Evorsi The shooting took place
just outside the home of Miss Evers at 1224 Sixth Avenue where the
two men met on their way to visit her.

Professors Griffith and Smith have lived together for several
years but parlrd company about a week ago when each decided that
the other had no I)DSIHE ' calling on Miss Evers. Since than} time the
feeling between them has grdun daily Wolse and this evening Cullni~
naled ill the shooting. Ml. Smith immediately gave himself up to the
pollt‘e department but that individual “as unable to scenic any state-
lllenl floln lliln concerning the tragedy.

.ur. Gillfith has been professor in the English department of the college
for the past four years and has been Dean or Men since last September. He
has paid considerable attention to Miss Evers. who is a. professor in the
French department. during the past year and a half. and the two were often
seen walking up the tracks or sitting in the cemetery. It was a common
rumor among the students and faculty that they were to be married in June.

.li. Smith is a professor in the French department of the college. At
the beginning of the war with Germany he left Grinnell with the smtement
that he intended to enlist in the French ambulance service. Upon his return
to Grmuell last fall he seemed to ﬁnd a great deal of pleasure in Miss Evcrs’
company, and it was then that the rivalry started winch ended in the shoot-
ing tonight.
