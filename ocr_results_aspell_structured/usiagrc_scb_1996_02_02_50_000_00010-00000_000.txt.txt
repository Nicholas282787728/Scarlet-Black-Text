victory.

Coach David Arseneault

commented, “Our fatigue te—
ally showed in the performance
of our three captains, seniors
Jeff Boyle, Ed Brands and An»
dris Upitis. The rest of the
team played well, but when
our top three wear down, we
have trouble winning. When
you add the fact that Cornell
played a wonderful game, it
was simply too much for us to
overcome.” Brands led all
scorers with 25 points, while
freshman Jeff Clement added
15 and junior Clayton
Kaneshiro 12. Upitis led Grlnt

LAST WEEK . . .

Last weekend Grinnell traveled
to Wisconsin to face St. Norbert and
