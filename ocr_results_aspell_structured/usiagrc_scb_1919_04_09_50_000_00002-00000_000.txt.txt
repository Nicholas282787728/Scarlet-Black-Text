’I‘IIE BASKETBALL SEASON.
with the ending of another basket-
ball season, Scarlet team, coach and
fans have again demonstrated to the
outside world, collegiate and otheiu
wise. that Grinncll is “there with the
punch". Beginning the season with
only one letter man, in faster company
than any in which the team has re-
, pcatedly played herore. the ﬁve pulled
ilseli together, placed its nose to the
gi-indsione, and ﬁnished in a tic toi-
third place with. one or the strongest
teams of the middle west. At one time
they were -cu conceded hy unnreiue
diced sportlwritei-s to he contenders
tor the title.

Opening the season with only one

' veteran in the lineup, and with
scarcely any practice, thc team se»
cured an even hreah in one oi the
hardest ser s ol the season, with the
Cornhnslrers. From then on the sea-
son was a gradual uphill climh, with
an occasional slip, to he sure, but all
leading to the inevitable result.

Who was responsible? Conch Huff,
to a large degree. Working around
his one veteran, the coach molded out
of green material a team that broke
even with Nebraska. in tour games, a
team that detoated Allies in the ﬁrst
game brtween the two ores and forced
her to the limit to win the return cons
test hr a narrow margin oi three
points, a team that demonstrated to
the lullest extent that Grinncll “never
says dies“ l .
* A great deal oi credit is due the
team tor their hearty co-opcration
thruont the season.
