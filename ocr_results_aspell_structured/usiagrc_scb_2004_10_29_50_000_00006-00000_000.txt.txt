Even though Student Affairs dropped charges against a student witness to vandalism who failed to provide Secu-
rity with names of perpetrators, SA expresses concern about the precedent the incident may have set

xv LOLA GARCIA

Though the Cleveland Beach graffiti
painted the first weekend of the semester is
fading, the subsequent security office’s investi-
gation has produced many questions. Namely,
should witnesses to violations otcoilege policy
be required to supply security with the names
of the perpetrators?

Megan Ford ‘06, SA for Cleveland First
and Fit, admitted that she did know some of
the people involved in the vandalism, but felt
that it was not her job as a student or staff
member to report the names of the students
involved to security. She was, however, listed as
the informant on a report submitted by RLC
LeAnne Jones.The report named another stue
(lent as involved in the vandalism.

on Aug. 31, Ford spoke with Steven Bris—
coe, director of security, to tell him that the
student listed on the report was nor respon-
sible for the vandalism. Briscoe asked Ford to

the scarlet and black

identify the perpetrators of the incident and
Ford declined to name them. She was asked
again three days later and again dcclined,

On Scpt,16,Briscoc filed charges with the
Judicial Councili He cited Fordrfor “failure to
obey a reasonable request

made, or direction given, “[SAs] are not paid for
a reason. .a
son I don’t have these

by a mcmhcr of the faculty
or administration" on two
separate occasionsrThe cita-

against me," she said, “I don’t think it's an okay
precedent to set.”

ancoe denicd comment for this story, tells
ing the SHE via email that, “I usually do not
comment about judicial charges,"and directed
further inquiry to the office
of Student Affairs.

Dean of Student Affairs
Jennifer Krohn,who refused
to have the charges heard

Student Handbook.

obligations is so peo
ple can feel comfort-
able coming to me.”

iMegan Ford ‘06

before JudCo, said that the
incident raised some issues
about the language of the
reasonable request clause.
“What the incident did was

she was called into the Stu—

dent Affairs ofﬁce and informed of the charges

as well as the decision not to pursue them.
While the charges were dropped, Ford re

mains unhappy with her situation. “I think it

is a problem that security brought [charges]

make us look at the policy,
and what rhar policy is," said Krohn. She said
that the clause under which Ford’s charges
were brought was “intended for the s eeific
person who is violating [college policy she
said, “It is not reasonable to use it when we

arc asking students to givt: information about
what other people have done."

Ford is particularly frustrated because she
thinks that the primary reason she was charged
was because of her position on student staff
“We are not paid for a reason," she said. “It is
not because the college doesn’t have the mane
cyThc reason I don't have these obligations is
so people can feel comfortable coming to me.“
Unlike Resident Advisors (RAs) at most other
colleges and universities, SAs are unpaid and
therefore not contractually obligated ro report
violations of college policy.

Krohn also emphasized the importance of
maintaining the SA system. “We give student
staff,..a pretty high level of confidentiality so
that they can deal effectively with students on
their floor," she said. “We want to keep that
in place."
