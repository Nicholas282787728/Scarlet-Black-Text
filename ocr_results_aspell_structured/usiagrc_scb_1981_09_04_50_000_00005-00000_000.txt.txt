black community has enough problems oi
its own, then what right have you to expect
white students to be interest in your pro-
blems'! The black community oiten appears
to espouse a “look out for number one"
policy, yet it is Unis very same philosophy
which Grinnell's blacks deplore in others.
We exhort whites to push for a Black Studies
program and to step up black recruitment
without demonstrating a tangible interest in
other campus concerns. is it any surprise
that blacks are viewed as lsolationists when
they are so reluctant to share their talents
and experiences with outsiders?

Yet how can that be'l, many will ask.
Don't blacks provide a Black Cultural
Center full of literature which non-blacks
can ireely take advantage oi? What about
Black Cultural Weekend and Black
Martyr's Weekend? Are these activities not
enough to demonstrate black interest in the
rest of the Grinnell community?

No. The greatest resource tor learning
about a group oi people is the people
themselves, people who interact in dorr
mitory iunctions and campus organizations
and who are secure enough in their iden-
tities to share themselves with others. Until
Grinnell's nonrwhite community sees an
open, enthusiastic, black community with
members involved in a variety oi campus
activities, little change will be felt in white
attitudes towards blacks.

To sum up, i suggest to the new students
at Grinnell, both black and white, to keep an
open mind and to be willing to change situar

Rock bands need'practice rooms and times

To the Editor:

Compared to most colleges of its size,
Grinnell College is blessed with a thriving
new and experimental music scene. Last
year, no iewer than seven rock bands and
several other creative groups offered enterr
tainment to the college. Though many
groups used their skills to earn money for
themselves, the majority oi the groups
spent the. majority oi their periormances
providing free entertainment or con
tributing their art to raise funds for such
diverse causes as the Grinnell Relays. 0x-
iam and the South African Support Group,
while more and more people appreciate the
muscial developments and more and more
opportunities arise for bands to play, the op
portunities ior these groups to practice have
been, at best, dismal,

The obvious place for bands to rehearse
would appear to be the Fine Arts Building.
in the lmsl school year. the Fine Arts 0i-
iice attempted to arrange a system which
would allow groups to use that iacility. Alter
students enrolled in music classes were
given the chance to sign up ior time 5105 on
weekend evenings, the remaining slots bet-
ween 8 pm and midnight on Friday, Satur-
day and Sunday were opened up to
amplitied bands. The reason ior this policy
was a logical one: rock bands are louder

than other users oi the practice spaces and'

can disrupt other students' practice, That
system tailed tor several reasons. First,
music students took advantage oi many oi
those time allocations and one or two bands
(the ones that existed early in each
semester) tended to control the remaining
time. By March, far too many bands existed
to operate within the “legal" boundaries of
the Fine Arts onice and severe troubles
resulted. Bands that had no weekend time
slots attempted to use times that they hoped
would open, including time on weeknights,
and occasionally, bands would totally
disregard the needs oi music students lor
their arguably equally-important needs.
They sought other spaces, including Herrick
Chapel, Darby Gym and even dorm lounges,
but no area welcomed them. The tensions
that developed are wellrknown to anyone
familiar with what goes on in Fine Arts.

No one argues that the bands should not
exist. A good deal of the campus community
enjoys and looks iorward to their perfor-
mancﬁ at their favorite local act. But in
order ior these bands to realize their
creative potential, they need more practice
time and space. When asked why iunding,
space and coaching are provided {01" sports,
many liberal arts colleges, including Grin-
nell, rationalize their actions by stating that
the development of athletic skills is
something that many students desire. A
similar logic holds in the case of the young
rock musician hoping m develop his talents.
Somehow, this logic is not included under
the present system.

A solution can be reached and the problem
warrants the spending oi the small amount
of money required to achieve it. Two im-
mediate suggestions come to mind. First, -
the Fine Arts Building. which currently
closes at midnight, could be left open until 2
a.m. each night and rock bands could have
10 p.m. to 2 a.m. on weeknighw In addition to
the current weekend hours with some eilort
made to prevent one or two groups from
securing all of the time slots. Secondly. and
perhaps more ideally, some room, perhaps
the basement or l-lerrick Chapel, perhaps
some space in Darby Gym, could be made
available for certain houls. With this pro
posal, groups would in no way interiere with
other musicians and would get the practice
time they need to periorm well.

We both have two years of Grinnell rock
periormances behind us and know the pro
blems. Our last band, Margaret Thatcher
and the Supply Side, pertormed publicly as
oiten as it rehearsed. We went on to periorm
on the East Coast for the summer and to
release a single. The development oi
musical talents at Grinnell can be as
valuable a part of Grinnell as the classes, as
this fact evidences, We hope that the Fine
Arts Ofﬁce and the general powersrthat-be
will make an effort to give bands the chance
mat we got only upon finding a garage in
Connecticut. Rock bands provide an impor
tant part or the Grinnell experience ior
musicians and audiences alike: a little en-
couragement can't hurt. 7Dave Mastci»
