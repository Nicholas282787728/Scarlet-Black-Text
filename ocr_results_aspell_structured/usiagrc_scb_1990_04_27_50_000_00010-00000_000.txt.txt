LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Students Call for Boycott of

Suggested Protests

To the editor,

A few suggestions for much-
needed campus activism:

1. Campaign and picket against
the “Classics“ department and
major for daring to promote one
culture as superior and original at
the expense of other cultures and
thereby condoning the racist. sex—
ist, homophobic, eurocentric, etc..
ideals inherent within (w)eslcrn
“Classic" culture. Suggested new
name for department and major:
Eurocentric Humanities.

2. Campaign and SGA vote on
altering the Grinnell Constitution
so that no gender specific pronouns
be included, due to the inherent
incqualitywhich thetenns“he,she,
himself, and herself" tend to per-
petuate. Suggested new pronouns
to express personhood: Co and
Cosr

3. Campaign and media assault
against the use ofthe word “major"
within the Grinnell academic and
social environment, forits inherent
designation of inequality and sepa-
ration from a hypothetical lesser
opposite“minor.“ Suggested new
designation: Specific Individual»
ﬂy

4 Campaign foran officialjud’
cial council action against an indi-
vidual whoconsistenlly,repeatedly,
and viciously expresses an opinion
which differs from officially ap-
proved thought. Strategy: Base
attack on grounds of perceived
violence and threats expressed by
the cartoon character “Spot,” as
drawn by the individual in ques—
tion.

5. Campaign and fog fast for
funds which will be sent to an or-
ganization which lobbies for a re-
structuring ofthe English language
so that neither grammar nor punc-
tuation be any longer required in
order to eradicate the symbols of
inequality which are currently
within the very foundation of our
conceptual systems, that being our
language,

6. Campaign for SGA legisla-
tion aimed at requiring all future
lM competitions to be held with

Will!

members of both sexes on both
sides at all times. lustitication:
Coerccd equality is a legitimate
means ofreetifying naturalinoqualr
ity.

7. Campaign and protestagainst
the 1M coordinators for including
the game ofchess in this year’s 1M
competition, which endorses the
stereotypical portrayal of the sole
femalepiece, the queen, as a super-
ficially powerful character requir-
ing theprotection ofcos chivalrous
male attendants, and which effec-
tivelyensconcesthe ultimatesource
of power within the male king.
Suggested replacement game:
Backgammon

8. Campaign and boycott of
improperly named all-campus par-
ties whose themes display an inap»
propriate attitude toward any natue
rat or personrmade disaster (Lei
Chemorbail, Armenian “Rock the
House Down“), or which incorpoe
rate a prior historical time or event
which may be deemed as display-
ing insensitivrty toward any ethnic
culture (Le. Pearl Harbor Day “Get
Bombed" Party, ”Gone With the
Wlnd “ Waltz).

9. Campaign to a community-
involving town parade to protest
the sciencebuilding forhousingthe
Math Department, which employs
vicious and morally indefensible
terminology and symbolism, in
cluding “less than,greater titan. not
equal to, plus, minus, divided by"
and many more even more devious
and complicated functions of ine-
quality. Recommendation: Aboli-
tion of the Math Department, crea-
tion of a Mulli-Cultural Computa-
tion Department.

Bar Over Racial Incidents

To the editor.

During the past few weeks there
has been a surge of harassment
incidents, many of them racially
motivated, oecurmg at the Bar and
otherplaces. Due to concern about
student safety, the Black Cultural
Center sponsored an open forum
meeting on Wednesday night to
discuss the incidents and search for
solutions. We assert our right to
walk into town without fear. We
assert our right to sit mm the Bar
without having to listen to
derogatoryandhumiliatingepithets.
We assertour right to stand up and
say, “This situation will no longer
be tolerated”. We are not interested
in aggravating this very serious
situation by name-callingorfinger—

pointing, We also not interested in
hiding in our rooms, and hoping
that this will all blow over.

From the unexpectedly large
turnout at the meeting on
Wednesday, we saw that the campus
recognizes this as aproblem which
affects all of us, We would like to
ask the campus to unify and show
the support for basic human rights
that this college is known for. We
propose that tomorrow night, April
28, the college abstain from
frequenting the Bar, to demonstatc
the importance we place on this
issue. We will be holding an all-
campus party in Gardner following
theperformancebyDelaSoulasan
alternative to the Bar. The owners
thheBarwill be forewarned ofthis
demonstration andaskedto provide

Direct Action Needed to
Make Point to Owner

To the editor,

Recently there has been an in-
crease in problems between slu-
denls and residents ofGrinncll town.
Themostnoticeable problems have
been located at one of the more
popular college hangouts, The Bar.
Walkingtoand from TheEarseems
to be getting more and more don»
gerous, and entrance to The Ear
does not mean safety by a longshot.

There has been a strong outcry
for safety measures atThe Bar, but
Larry, the owner of The Bar, has
ignored the need. His neglect for
the needs of AfricanrAmerican
customers,particularlytheirsafety,
is causing further problems for all
the students ofGrinnell College.

A meeting was just held at the
BCC. We discussed what to do to
get the point across to Larry that we
weren‘tgoingto take his shitwitha
smiling face anymore. The same
safety precautions as before still

exist. always walk to The Bar (or
anywhere in town after dark) in
groups of at least four.

But it is time for more direct
action. The way to get the point
across to Larry isto hurt him in his
most vulnerable spot, his wallet.
This Friday night, instead of wan»
dering overtoThe Bar, go to Card
nor for The Skip Day Party. Satur-
day, aftcr De La Soul has finished
playing wanderover to CBS' party
at Gardner instead of The Bar,

The only way to get any reaction
fromLai-ryistoshowhimhecanno
longer treat us like shit and then
take ourmoney. it is timefordirect
action against Larry and his racist
establishment. This weekend,
boycott The Bar, Let Larry know
who his customers are when they
don’t show up. Show Larry the
students ofGrinnell college are not
to be abused any longer.

a “bouncer” for next year, who
would remove any harassing or
threatening individuals. in case
this doesn'twork,wewillbeforced
to lake stronger courses of action,
e.g. research altematives to the Bar
for next year.

We would like to STONGLY
STRESS that limbo’s is in no way
responsible for or connected with
theaboveincidents,andwestrongly
encourgagelhecampus to continue
to support both limbo himself, and
his business. If you do decide to
walk to the Bar, we urge you to go
in groups, and reportall harassment
incidents both to Student Affairs
and the police.

ASSAULT:

Should

sexual abuse support group so
that they can find support from
people who have been through
experiences similar to theirown.
Also, Student Atrnirs should
formulate a set punishment for
pcrsonsfoundguiltyofdale—mpe.
This would prevent any
discrepancies in the way
offenders are treated. Finally,
the college should provide more
help, such as free consultation
with the college lawyer, if the
the victim decides to pursue the
case outside of Student Affairs
and take it to court.

 

 

 

Peace Day Band is Wasteful Expense

To the editor,

'I'hereisnohopeforpeacewithin
asociety thathas nojustice. Surely,
justice includes being responsible
with the resources (financial and
otherwise) at your/our disposal.
Try as we might, we can not find
a justification for the $10,000
the college is shelling out for
the “psychedelic rap" band De La
Soul.

it only takes a moment‘s
reflection to realize that the
distribution of resources in
this country is unjustly skewed and
that on the global scale it is
absolutely ruinous. One speaker
for the “Global Warming"

conference noted that one “First
World" child Consumes about 230
times the resources of a Haitian or
Ugandan child. Obviously, the
point isn‘t to reduce ourselves to
the level of absolute poveny (which
over70% ofall Haitians arebclow,
meaning that their bodies are not
receiving the daily minimum of
resources for survival). Rather, we
need to move towards a lifestyle
that is sustainable for all of the
world'speoplesaridwillallow them
the dignity and room for the self
development that “Peace Day"
implies.

Wedon’t feel that it is hyperbolic
to compare Grinnell's throwing
310.000 at a few minutes of luxury

to the type of disgusting behavior
exhibited by the parasitic elites of
nationslikeHaiLi,This“PeaceDay"
concert waste is just as exorbitant '
and selﬁsh, and only distance (and
staying comfortably numb) keeps
us from seeing that it is just as
violent

This letter is not meant to place
any speciﬁc blame, nordo wewant
to take the space here and now toair
any particular solutions. but we
would like people with ideas or
comments to contact us (Box 6
