KGRW Will Sign Off
After Tonight’s Show

“The radio voice of Grinnell
college” will be silent after to—
night’s program of dance music
for open house, according to
George Halsey, student manager
at college radio activities KGRW
will resume broadcasting in
September, when try—outs for
staff positions will be held. Mr.
Herbert Prescott, radio director,

will announce the new staff

Now that we have toddled a few small steps closer to
early this iall.

a rational maturity, and have sat through several years of
house and club meetings, we begin to understand why Mr.
Roberts ever bothered to write a book (one that everyone
knows about but which few people ever read).

Far from being silly and unnecessary and a waste of
time, the use of proper parliamentary procedure in a meet-
ing insures an effecient and equitable regard for the rights
and opinions of all persons cencerned. Adherence to even
the basic rules makes allowance for adequate discussion
of the business at hand, and a fair decision, respecting the
rights of all.

' We suggest that those people who in the past month
or two have become officers of various campus organiza-
tions get hold of Mr. Roberts’ slim volume and brush up on
’the fundamental rules of a game which they will be referee-
ing this next year. Perhaps then the official gatherings
of students will be more like business meetings than the
verbal king-of—the-hill games which have gone on this past

yeFound. . . One Worthwhile Cause

During the course of a school year we are reminded
of many worthy causes. Sometimes they are pretty hard
to understand, seem distant and unrelated to our day-to-
day existence on the campus. ,

But the establishment this week of the Mlachel O’Leary
Trust Fund in memory of Leroy O’Leary by the men of
Cowles hall seems to us to be a very down to earth, under-
setandable sort of cause. Many of us knew Roy; some of
knew Mike We firmly believe that a cause so close to
home will appeal to the generosity of all Grlnnell students.
Just a little from each of us will do so much toward creat—
ing a living monument to a swell guy.
