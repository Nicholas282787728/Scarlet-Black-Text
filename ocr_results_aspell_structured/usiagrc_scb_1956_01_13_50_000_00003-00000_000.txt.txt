Students" Given An Outstanding Evening
By Weinrich In College Concert Series

by Hoyle Carpenter

The patrons of the Grinnell college concert series were

given an outstanding musical

evening last Monday in Her-

rick chapel. Carl Weinrich‘s talent plus one of the outstand-
ing instruments of the Middle—West equal organ music at

its best.

Weinrieh is a technician of
the first order. He handles dif-
ficult passages with clarity and
ease. We have a right, of course,
to take this for granted in a
concert artist, and Weinrich did
not disappoint us. He overcame
difficulties without fuss. There
was none of the “look, Ma, no
hands" approach as used by
some accomplished organists
who shall remain nameless
here. 'As one person very

aptly put it, ‘fHe does not get in
the way of the music."

More significant than his
technical prowess, however, is
Weinrich's deep understanding
of the musical significance of
what he plays. The Byrd and
Scurlatti pieces, for example,
not too far removed from each

approaches. Weinrich possesses
the musical knowledge and in-
sight to give each piece the
right tempos, the right blend-
ings and contrasts, and the
right phrasiugs to make each
selection musically signiﬁcant.

Of special interest to organists
choice of stops. The
Herrick chapel organ has a
wealth of resources. Weinricb
made the most of these with-
out gilding the lily by making
too frequent changes. Some of
his Choices were unusual, as,
for example, in the first of the
Bach Choraerreludes, “Lord
God, Now Open Wide Thy
Heavens," With the emphasis on
the reed stops.

Probably most concert-goers
do not realize the difficulties
that the travelling organist faces
in choosing stops, The violinist
brings his own instrument with
him and the vocalist is blessed
or cursed with what God gave
him. The pianist may play on
different instruments which may
differ in the amount of resonance
or weight of touch. but still a
piano is a piano. All have 88
notes on one keyboard and three
pedals that do the same'things
on all instruments.

No‘ such standardization
exists with organs. Every well-
madc organ is custom-built to
fit its surroundings. Instru-
ments vary greatly in size and
arrangement or stops. The or.
ganist must familiarize him.

plan his choice of stops in a
hurry. Weinrich did all this in
the some day that he played
the concert.

This writer would rather have
heard some other Bach than
the “ever-popular" Toccata and
Fugue in D Minor. The Liszt
Fugue from the “Ad Nos
Salutarem” is rather bombastic
for my taste. Dn the other
hand, the lovely little piece,
Pavana, ”The Earl of Salisbury,"
by william Byrd, and the pro—
found First Sonata by Hinde-
mith were outstanding. ,

if you had to put off that
term paper one more day in or-
der to attend this concert it
was well worth it.
