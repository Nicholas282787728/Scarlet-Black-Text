optional clothing activities are deﬁnitely
nothing new on the Grinnell—a campus that
not only boasts various groups going naked ev-
ery now and then, but also has been known to
have seen some unusual protests.

This past Thursday a number of students
took their clothes off and got their picture
taken as a way to celebrate not only their own
beauty but also to commemorate one of these
aforementioned unusual protests.

on Feb. 5, 1959 a representative of Plays
boy magazine came to Grinnell as part of tour
across different college campuses. But not ev-
ery student was exactly fond ofPlayboy maga»
zinc and its portrayal of naked/nude bodies.
During the representative's speech 10 students
stood up, started to sing and began to undress
as a way of protesting the magazine,The stu»
dents were later found guilty of public inde-
cency in 1971.

Forty years later, in 2009, the public display
of discontent in the form of nudity came back
to campus in form of a Naked Photo-shoots A
brainschild of Emma O’Polka ’12, the Naked
Pholcrshoot was initiated last year as part of
Media Awareness Week.

"I learned about the Playboysincident for
an independent project in my tutorial,”O’Polka
said. “I was surprised that with Grinnell hav-
ing a history ofpoljtical and social activism as
it is, that no one had picked up on it.”

So she initiated the ﬁrst naked phottr
shoot to occur exactly 40 years after the origis
nal protest on Feb. 5, 2009.

“It was not intended as a demonstration
against pornography," O’Polka said. “But as a
way to celebrate beauty and
social activism,"

Everyone on campus was
invited to have their picture
taken in whatever state of un-
dress they felt most comfortr
able, while eating food and
hanging out with other likes
minded students. With the
consent of the photographed
person the pictures were later
sed in a public display con-

ertaining to President—elect Kington have
anged from elation to skepticismThe con-
ersation topic is buzzing amongst not just
he student body but within the faculty of
faces and staff rooms as well.
By and large, students have readily em-
braced President-elect Kington, citing con-
ﬁdence in his leadership experience.
"Some people joked, after his speech,
that his honeymoon period is already over,"
aid Ben Offenberg '11,
SGA Vice President of
Student Affairs. “There

erejokes about that, but
'n reality I haven’t heard
much other than praiSs
es and excitement that

e‘ve got someone of his
aliber to come here."

Students have read

Kington's online bios,
and heard his speech in
Herrick Chapel, but few have had any real

ontact with him. Many were impressed,

“or the over so people who
got their picture taken more than
half let us use their pictures for a
public display," O’Polka said.

Even though it is not com-
pletely ruled out yet, there are no
deﬁnite plans to use the pictures
for any kind of presentation this
year,

not only by his resume, but also by his views
on issues pertinent to the community, and
his strong support for social justice.

"He said a lot of positive things in his
speech,1 think, a lot of salient issues like
the campus climate report last semester."
Liting Cong ’11, said. “There isn't enough
of support for minority staff and faculty,
and he said everyone's contribution will be
recognized,”

Offenberg relayed the same sentiments.

“He talked a little bit about social jus-
tice, and how this is a mission-based in-

stitution, which is why I feel
like we could recommit our

“Last year was a commemoration of the
Playboy incident," said Zoe schein '12, who
is also involved in the planning of this year’s
naked photoVshoot. “But the main point of it
was and still is to celebrate different kinds of
bodies and make people feel comfortable in
their own skin."

Of all the key themes running through the
shoot, comfort level is the most important.

“There is a lot of peer support but no ptcsz
sure to do anything," Schein said, “People can

sor Wayne Moycr, Political science, raised
some very pertinent questions as the school
awaits the arrival of
Kington on the cams
pus next August.

“He has an in-
credibly strong back-
ground. His appoint—
ment certainly sends
a very good message
in terms of diversity,"
Moyer said. "[But]
his background is pri—
marily as a scientist. I
know he will be cons
scious to the needs of the scientists. But
will he be equally conscious to the social
scientist and the humanities?"

According to Moyer, while his cols
leagues have been impressed and stamped
their approval, Moyer senses a certain am-
biguity about Kington's plans for the Col—
lege. ”What is his academic vision for the
college? We don't know yet," Moyer said.
“What are his priorities? We don't know
that yet."

Students who participated last year con—
ﬁrmed it could deﬁnitely have a certain excites
ment to have one’s picture taken, while being
in any state ofundress.

"I was positively peer-pressured into par—

shoot last year. “It felt liberating to not care for
a little bit and appreciate everyone’s unconven-

“For a long time, Grinnell has failed t
capture the potential of it
most powerful resources,—

email. "The next chapter in

accept that challenge, Grinnell will mos
certainly rise to meet him."

Her view is echoed within the studen
body.

“Students are willing to help him as

which is unique, in that respect, because h
