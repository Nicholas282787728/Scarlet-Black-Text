from the editor

Athletics—Grinnell-style .

Phrases like “winning isn’t everything” have long been used
to characterize sports at Grinnell. The school offers no athletic
scholarships and often students brag about our teams’ tendan-
cies of having win-loss records below .500.

But athletics are important to some studentsi both on a per-
sonal and intercollegiate level. Take a walk around campus
some afternoon: you’ll see students involved in all sorts of
athletic activity,

This week the 8&3 focuses on sports at Grinnell. Senior con-
tributor Renae Reese looks at the diversity of pastimes enjoyed
by students. Assistant editor for sports Eric Rasmussen ex~
amines Grinnell’s PEC. And sports reporter Allan Zond com-
ments on images of Grinnell athletes.

(By the way, that’s Dave Smiley on the cover, scoring Grin-
nell’s only at-horne touch down of the year against Cornell.)
