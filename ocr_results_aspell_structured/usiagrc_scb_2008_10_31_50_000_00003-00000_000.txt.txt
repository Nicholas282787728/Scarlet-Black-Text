program, a nationwide program run in all 50

Federal Emergency Management Agency.
Both C-CERT and CERT are designed to
train civilians to respond to disasters within
their communities.

While CERT has been active in Poweshiek
County for several years, the College only rcs
cently decided to create its own program.

Student helps set up writing lab at Grinnell Community High

David Paige 09 is hoping to create 1 non-

Grinnell College students have begun to tutor
students at oiiiincll Community High school

gram developed by Paige and Judy Hunter, die

College

Paige said he started tlic program largely
because he wanted to “foster a better relation-
slitp between the town and the college.”

“I think it’s abysmal how bad the towns
gown relationship is here,“ he said, Paige also
said he hopes to teach after graduation. and
that working with high school students would
give him experience in education.

At the high school, teachers were also one
thusiastic about the program. “I would like
it" said Nissa Grecnquist, who teaches a class
called Common Literature. “1 have worked
with [writing programs] in Iowa City, as I was
going through school. It does help the stun
dents."

According to Roda Harris, an English
teacher at the high school, her students have
expressed great interest in the Writing Lao
“This week a couple ofstudcnts were stuck on

an introductory par1gr1ph They couldnt get
it off the ground sol 111d to give them sonic
idea but for some it iv1s slowly moving along,"
Harris said. “They were the ones that seemed
really excited to have 1 lab."

Through the wilting lib, Paige said he
hoped to ciente better relations between Cole
lcge students and the local community “I am
hoping to be able to interact and become a part
or the town as oppnscd to 1 scp1r1tc entity,"

Dcspitc initial high hopes, the progr1m
has run into logistical problems with schedul-
ing 1nd transportation. According to Hunter,
trying to get the volunteers and high school
students'availability has been problematic.

Paige said that transportation to and from
the High School, which is about 1 mile away
from the College, w1s originally planned
to provided by security, but that the varying
schedules of writing lab tutors led to difficult
ties,

There is no more Collegessponsored trans-

Symposium examined democracy around the world

iii/JEFF RADERSTRONG

This past week, democracy came early to
Grinnell’s campus.

In the past three days, the Rosenfield Prov
gram in Public Affairs, International Relations
and Human Rights hosted a symposium titled
“The state ofDemocracy," bringing an intcrr
national perspective to the us. electoral pro-
cess. The symposium included speeches from
scholars orsix different regions, ranging from
Latin America to Russia.

Rosenﬁeld Committee member Keith
Brouhle ’96, Economics, said that Rosenfield
Program decided on the topic largely due to its
relevance in relation to democracy promotion
otthe Bush administration's foreign policy

“[Democracy promotion] has certainly
been behind the scenes in the last 50 years,'
Erouhle said. “certainly, in the last five years
we've heard Bush talk about differentjustifiea-
tions, and this was one ofthem.”

Convocation speaker Thomas
deputy executive director of Freedom House,
addressed the topic in his speech “Democracy
Promotion in a Time ofTransition,"

Roscnﬁcld Director Sarah Purcell ’92,
History, also pointed to the timeliness of the
symposium in relation to Nov 4. “[The sym—
posium] is a great pre-election topic,"she said.
“[lt’s] a good way for us to think about the
concept of democracy in the week before the
election,"

Melra, _

Purcell said it was important to not remove
American democracy from the evaluation of
the symposium. She said the different views
on campus this week help with that evaluation.
"The international Context is really important
and interesting for our own electoral process,"
Purcell said.“We shouldn’t leave ourselves uni
examined in the process.”

Aside from current events. many of the
speakers discussed historical interactions be-
tween communism and democracy, such as
Hans Apel, who lectured on the European po-
litical atmosphere since World War Ii.

Brouhle noted that this symposium comes
almost two decades after the end of the cold
war and can be seen as a reﬂection on democV

racys progress around the world since then.
"We’ve caught our breaths," Brouhlc said
"People have had time to do well or not do
well. Now is a time to see what happened."

The committee chose speakers based on
the topics they wanted addressed, but they also
tried to get a diverse regional representation.
"We do tr to get a balance of areas," Purcell
said. “We also] do think ofcertain themes and
think of the best speaker for that topic."

Phoebe Leung '09, a student on the
Rosent‘ield Committee, appreciated hearing a
non—American perspective about administers
ing democracy. “It’s interesting to have that
crosscountry understanding of democracy,"
she said.
