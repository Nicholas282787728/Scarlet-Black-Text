adequacy which we perceived in the ‘.'

S&B;.Your article on the iconoclast in
the Sept. 26 issue simply confirms this.
it is an example of shoddy journalism
and poor editing. The facts are incor-
rect, the quotations are inaccurate, and
the last sentence is pure fiction. ,

I am not ”the editor” DI the
Iconoclast. I am a member of the
editing staii, which also presently in-
cludes Bill Sweeney and Joel Robbins.
The stall is not closed, as the article' im-
plies but is open to anyone with a
sincere dedication to the paper.

We did not “begin the paper because
we felt that certain groups were not get-
ting accurate representation on cam-
pusr‘.’ If anything, we were responding
to a lack of adequate representation of
issues. While the paper serves, in a
sense' as a “forum for student
opiruons," we do not print opinions
which are not well reasoned and based
to a certain extent in fact.

The final clariﬁcation I would like to
make is that I do not edit a socialist
publication called “Dui‘unct,” nor have
I ever heard at such a publication. I
have no idea where Ms. Babbitt came
up with this title or with the idea that I
edit or am involved with any publica
tion other than the Iconoclast. lam not.

editors oi the 8&3 have shown poor

The editor replies. Failing to make it

"c ear that all three oi the people listed

.in the letter above were part or the
, g stall oi the ‘Iconoclast" was a
in take in phrasing on our part. We
apologire lor this. The implication that
the stall was closed was given to our
reporter by Ms, Layng. During the in-
terview with Ms. Lang, no mention was
made or the lact that the stall is open to
anyone.

Second, all quotes and statements
reierred to in the third paragraph ol the
letter were Ms. Layng's and were
.veriiied before publication of the arti-
cle.

in reiereiice to the "Duluuct. our
reporter has acknowledged that this
was a misunderstanding. She conrerred

in M5. Layng over the phone about
this point and said that it was dillicult
to hear. However, the name "Dulunct"
was also conlirmed by Ms. Layng dur-
ing the call, possibly due to the some
problem with the phone. The reporter
involved pliers her apologies and em-
phasiles that no oileiisc oi any kind was

A lesson

from history?

To the Editor: This isvin reactihi'to‘

the phrase "a disproportionate number
oi jocks," which I encountered in last
week’s sails, and to the general land ap
parently growmgl sentiment it seems
to represent. I am not advocating more
"emphasis" on football; I am, in fact,
reminded at a shameIul incident that
happened on campus about 20 years
ago.

in the tall oi 1960 there appeared in
the freshman class a young man from
Kentucky, who were long hair and
rather flamboyant clothes; he had a
guitar and sometimes sat up in a tree
and played it, He was intelligent and
polite. but some students lelt threatens
ed by him 7 thinking perhaps he
represented an "unwelcome" trend and
that he did not [it in to the "Grinnell Ex~
periencei"

One night a group oi students in his
hall Jumped him and shaved his head.
I'm sure all ol your readers will agree
that was a stupid and inhuman thing to
do, But I wonder whether the ill-
tolerance shown 20 years ago against
those free spirits who were labeled
"hippies" was much worse than the
mentality revealed these days by
students who are saying, “I didn't ask
for jocks, did youl"

The students who cut oil Terry
Bisson's hair were, I'm told, mostly
Jocks So the point iS not whether jocks
or antirjocks have a monopoly on
bigotry. Twenty years ago some
students were looking at the advent oi
long hair on campus and worrying
about the future of Grinnell, The ones
who asked then, "Would you want your
kids to go here 20 years lrom now‘l"
rellected a dillerent style. perhaps,
from those who raise that rabid cry m,
day, but they were alilieted by the
same smug sell~righteousness

I don't know what to make OI the
irony that one generation‘s Victimizer
is another generation's victim, but i do
know that intolerance is a sickness all
kinds at people can catch. 7 James
