Conquering

the

Conference

by Grant Ehrlich

This past weekend, the soccer
team dominated their nearest peer
in the conierenee, Knox College.
The game was a real hair»raiser as
both regular time periods went
scoreless, but then, with two
minutes leit in the iirst hali oi the
overtime period, Steve “Eat the
Ball" Fairchild scored the only
goal oi the game, A Knox iullback
did not like this and soon aiter
labeled him pretty well. but he
should be iine tor the next game.

The game began with the
bleachers about hall lull, but as
people leaving the iootball game
heard the soccer crowd's cheers,
screams, and remarks about the
opponent, they soon tilled the
bleachers in hope oi observmg a
winning game.

So why were there so many peer
pie at a game that ran scoreless tor
90 minutes? Our team dominated
the whole game, but they could not
score. Knox had a number oi scary
breakaways, but our deiense con
trolled them. The key player in our
detense was Toby Ewing, He was
just ”on” tor this game Usually
Brad Bisgard, otherwise known as
“Milk,“ highlights the deiense, but
in this game Milk ran all over the
tield As Coach Ptitsch called to
captian Rick "The Weasel” Koddis
in the second hali, "Tell Bisgard to
stop running around and get back
there!" So Toby took over. in a big
way Time and time again heshoiu
ed up in the middle oi the play,
usually stopping a Knox iast break
or initiating an attack, lan
Lorimer also had some great
plays. For mostoi the game he was
triplerteamed. but that only slowed
him a little Fans will remember
on incredible play where ian was
triple-teamed just oii the sideline
with two deienders behind him and
one in iront oi him. Most players
would ireak in this situation but
ian kept this cool, paused with his
toot on the ball as ii he were say-
ing, “No, we’ll wait," and then pro
ceeded to pass them all by rolling
around the two deicnders behind
him and away irom the other. it
was amazing.

oi the previous evening, Andy Lae
ing got real lucky. He could have
received a card a number oi times,
The iirst was when he told the
Knox stands, or bench, to read bet
ween the lines. probably because
oi the drunken behavior oi the trat

boys in the stands I wish someone

would burn their Phi Delta ilag.
Andy also nailed the Knox goalie
pretty well, causing a 10-minute
delay oi the game. i guess their
other goalie must have been pretty
bad, or they would have put him in.

Last Wednesday our kickers
crushed Coe on Mac iield The
game resembled the iootball
game, but in this case we were on
top The iinal score was 7 to 1.

The team, trying to duplicate
their so south division record oi
last season, will travel to lllinois
College on Saturday, tomorrow.
and to Cornell on Friday October
