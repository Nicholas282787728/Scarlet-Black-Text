Questions Clinger Over computer, controversy
Firings called result of “professional jealousy”

by Steven W. Way and
Eric Weiss

Organized protest by Grinnell students,
town citizens and alumni began to place
strung pressure on the college administra-
tion this week to explain the still-
mysterious iirings oi Assistant Director oi
Computer Operations and Senior Systems
Analyst David Renaud and Coordinator of
Administrative Computing and Director of
Computer Operations Mark Grundler and
the violation of student computer mail files
which took place just two weeks ago.

Studena are concerned about computer
privacy and a seeming inability on the part
of the administration to justify its sudden
decision to terminate Renaud and
Grundler, The student user consultants
lU.C.'s) at the Computer Seerce Center
circulated a letter to all faculty and staff
clariiying iacts surrounding the case. A
letter to all college trustees seeking active
support ior the student's views was also
sent across the nation this morning.

Amid the first news reports of the coma
puter brouhaha, according to some
students and Grinnell residents, were in-
herent attacks upon the character and
reputation of the two terminated
employees. Further, not until this week
has the issue of invasion of privacy on the
administration's part been focused on.
Some labeled the search of student files as
unethical and possibly illegal.

“The reasons he [Executive Vice Presi
dent Waldo Walker] has given for the mail
iile searches have been very, very vague
7 and just in general, he’hasn't really
come down to the question oi what were
the original reasons Why these files were
gone through," said Lesley williams, an
active opponent oi the alleged violation oi
privacy. Said Melinda Hunt, 3 U.C.. “No
one knows what the charges mean except
Waldo Walker and Tom Moberg [director
of Academic Computing].”

In ﬂ'ie course of gathering evidence for
the dismissal cases, either the administra~
tion or the director of Academic Com-
puting authorized entry into the private aC-
count oi Hunt. Under computer service
policy, computer tiles cannot be entered
except in cases of computer security
breaches, suspected violations of a federal
or state law or violation oi a computer
related college regulation.

“1 know that all the U.C.'s are concerned
about the fact that mail files are read and
about the fact that no reason has been
given tor the mail iile entry and niat no
notification of the people involved was
given." Hunt said,

“It was a completely clandestine opera-
tion: here we're going to read your tiles
and not tell you why ii you catch us and it's
very disturbing." Hunt continued, “Some
of the U.C,'S are concerned about the ef-
iecls on the Computer Center since Mark

and Dave were the two most technically
competent people there."

Given the fact that administrative of-
l'icials decline to cite, even to Renaud and
Grundler, specific reasons tor terminating
them — as well as the swift and harsh
punishment doled out [or participating in
what many regard as a harmless fan club
[the Tom Moberg Fan Club] -— many
students are concluding that the “club”
was only a scapegoat for an administra-
tion eager to end personal feuding at Com-
puter Services,

“Personally, I think it's a lot of bunk,” a
user consultant said. ”I think it's
something trumped up so they have
another excuse to fire them. No one's tell-
ing me what is going on and no one‘s telling
Dave and Mark what’s going on "

Margaret Brink, who has known Dave
Renaud since he was born, has actively
protested the administration's decision to
fire Renaud and Grundler on what she
believes are groundless charges, certainly
not reason for dismissal. Besides talking
with the 5&5, she also wrote a letter to the
editor of The Grinnell Herald-Register,
which was published last Monday.

“I think there’s been an overreaction —— I
think it's too bad and am Sure that Mr.
Moberg probably ielt hurt that the
students formed this little club. I think he
would have accepted it at face value unless
he had reason to believe that ﬂ'iey had a
right to criticize and that therefore he
received it as facetious," Brink said.

“I think they will probably get every lit
tle thing they can and blow it all out oi pro
portion in order to defend their position,"
Brink said. “But I would hope that they
would be big enough not to do this because
it is a very petty way ior people in very
high positions to act. It's not easy to admit
you're wrong and i hope that they're big
enough people to do this,“

Newton White, a Grinnell alumnus now
at Harvard Law School, is one of a number
of alumni who have contacted the ad-
ministration m warn of what he called the
“tremendous expense" incurred by iiring
Renaud and Grundler.

(bnlacted in Cambridge Wednesday

, evening. White said he spent 45 minutes on

the phone with President George Drake,
giving him an inside view on the diiiiculty
the college is likely to encounter in trying
to iind replacements ior two men iired
under such mysterious circumstances.

“Having been a little lndian over at the
computer center. I pointed out that they
had made a decision that was going to be
very expensive to the college." White said,
”During my years at Grinnell there was
always a strong animosity between Ad-
ministrative Computing and Academic
Computing."

other students close to computer opera-
tions speculated that the fan club excuse
was just the last straw in a series oi run-ins
between Moberg and Administrative Com-
puting. “From the time that I’ve known
the people at the computer center, they
didn't get along with Moberg and Moberg
didn't get along with them," said a uc
who wished to remain unidentiiied.

“I'm told that there is a certain amount
oi proiessional jealousy," the student said.
”Moberg and Mark [Grundler] have
argued irequenuy over the past iew years
and Mr, Walker met with them ti think
every other week), mainly to arbitrate
their disagreements,“

students store personal letters both writ»

“It‘s a touchy area [or a number of
reasons: there are no legal precedents ior
it: it’s a real new ﬁeld and the
technological know-how is always chang
ing," williams said, “But it doesn‘t really
give you an excuse to totally violate civil
liberties"

“If you have to go through someone's file
you should either warn them in advance,
or it you ieel it is the sort oi thing where
they could wipe out all the evidence imr

the tile, so you can at least show that you
had a reason for doing it."

Computer Operator Ron Renaud, Dave .
Renaud's brother, said the computer shut
down procedure iollowing the sudden iir-
ings was improper because “changing the
locks on the door and posting guards were
gave the impression oi something illegal
going on."

”Staff members were allowed access to
personal computer files without constant
supervision," Ron Renaud said. “There
should have been an unbiased observer
there at all times." He pointed out that
during the entire shutdown both Moberg
and his assistant Mary Verkade (who first
discovered the fan clubi had access to the
computer."

Williams said she had heard from a
number of faculty and staff members who
agreed with the students protesting the
questioned propriety oi the computer tir-
ings but who would not speak on the record
for fear of retribution,

"There‘s a lot of faculty and staff who
feel a Sense of impending doom when talk-
ing about this," she said. “They really
aren't too crazy about coming out on one
side or the other because there is a worry
oi job security; that is mostly true oi staii
in the computer center but it is true oi
other iaculty also,"

“One person told me, 'I-iey, all I need to
do to get iired around here is join a club
with someone‘s name on it,’ "
