The Contadora Act and the electoral process

One recurring issue that consistently
ialls prey to the political jargon oi the
leaders of nations. and hence, remains
elusive and muddled, is that of tlie “elecc
torn] process,H It is unfortunate that our
attempts to understand this issue must
always be subject to the hallowed and
hollow remarks of our more illustrious
political actors. For as you will see, the
issue. stripped oi the jargon, is still tar
irom cut and dry.

.ln an article dated February let, i
discussed what 1 consider to he the
sabotage of the Contadora labor. Upon
writing the essay. the issue was raised:
Politics aside. what is the Contadora Act?
The answers are many and varied The
section ot the treaty to he discussed here is
entitled: "Commitments Regarding Elecc
toral Processes and Parliamenlary
Cooperation," The ideal governing this
section, (and the treaty' ’ whole), is that
each oi the treaty's parti pants resolves
to iuliill the measures promulgated in the
document in order to ensure domestic
peace as a contribution toward a greater.
regional peace

This analysis touchcs on two “key"
areas of United States interest. and sulfice
to say, U S, influence on the outcome (if
this discussion will he profound, The first
area is tairly general in scope, it is
directed toward the achievement of
"political pluralism ” This is to be reached
through several measures’ at) equal par-
ticipation of political parties .in electoral
processes, bi ensuring their access to the
mass media. and c) ensuring their
ireedom or assembly and expression

There are a few problems with this sec.
tion of the treaty, but for the most part
they concern only the wording, Regarding
the clause on “equal participation,” to my
knowledge no country to date can boast
truly “equal" participation oi all political
parties. not even the United States of
America Here. tor example. the system is
more aptly characterized by equal par
ticipation only within a politically dualistlc
society, The participation oi those parties
that fall outside the realm of our domestic
political dualism just isn'tequal. Equality
encompasses more than just hurling your
name on the ballot. . . .

Thus, complementary to the question (if
“equal participation," is that which colic
cents equal access to the mass media. ls
this to say that anyone can advertise in the
mass media? I don't think so, But never
thefess, it is sale to say that this Situation
is not to be found in the U.Sf and it is
doubtful that one will soon find it in the
other American countries I think. instead.
that the statement is implying that those
who can pay tor itwill have equal access to
the mass media, That. anyway, is the case
here at home. though one ought not coir

The State Department objections,
(Those which aren't classiiiedi call the
section “relatively strong" but will not
support it. They- cite:

Nicaragua‘s continued relusal to
establish conditions to permit Arturo
Cruz to participate in their elections
coiillicts dramatically with the prin»
ciplcs set iorth in the agreement.

But in this case which developed last

‘much too thin That the leaders in
Managua repeatedly invited Arturo Cruz
to participate in the November 4. elections
is secondary, The problem with this
and sin ot the Contadora Act is that it has
little to do with the negotiations at hand,

Uruz’ primary plea was that the San
(linistas negotiate with the “contras " The
Sandinista refusal to fulfill that request
was an open invitation ior Cruz to launch a
campaign in Nicaragua for political
recognition. He chose not to accept, his
absence made a bigger political statement
internationally. most notably with the
U.S., than he probably could have elicited
via the elections at home. Unquestionably.
Cruz' nonrvote was more effective at
discrediting his opposition.

The final part oi the Section on the elec»
toral process and parliamentary coopera-
tion oiiers a number of suggestions to the
legislative organs at these nations; they
are directed not at domestic affairs, but at
regional relations. Contadora proposes: r
intermittent meetings should be scheduled
between representatives oi each nation to
"exchange experience;" the respective
legislatures ought to take special care to
work with the Latin American Parlia-
ment; the nations should work towards the
development oi a comparative study oi
electoral legislation in the region. each in
dividual nation ought to invite observers
from the other nations in the region on the
event of their elections; and lastly. the na»
tions ought to periodically hold meetings oi
a “technical nature.” deciding between
themselves regarding the agendas to be
followed.

The honest idealism of the Contadora
Act is clear, yet one must also be aware oi
the years at work that have gone into the
document. Mexico. Panama. Colombia
and Venezuela have pledged in good iaith
to bring a peaceful future to a land and a
people raped by the seliinterests oi a tew.
it is an offer of relief to those who have suf-
fered in the aftermath of what is often seen
as a just response to years oi brazen
repression. in this scenario the occurrence
of an election is a curious thing, an event
not destined to fall victim to so many emp-
ty phrases. Amidst this scenario is the key
to Contador cooperation.

l share the concerns oi many that the

to do something about improving the

college. but oeiore it. My question is, can
