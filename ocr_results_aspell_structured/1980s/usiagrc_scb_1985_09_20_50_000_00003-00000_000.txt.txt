“We held iirmly to thc priority to get a
quality black candidate, Thatpolicy. right-
ly or wrongly, is considered a restricted
search.” said Catherine Frazer. Dean of
Faculty. Historically and presently.
therein lies the crux of the controversy
regarding the Afro-american literature
position currently attached tothe English
department. ‘

In the middle 1970’s. out of a growing in
terest in minority affairs. the Grinnell
trustees established an Afro-american
studies position. Although they deemed it a
valuable addition to the curriculum. the
trustees created the position wlﬂi the
“perfectly legitimate intent to give us an
opportunity to bring a black prolessor on
campus.” said Frazer.

Since its creation. the position has been
under the auspices oi several depart-
ments. and in the last six years has been
considered an English position. However.
even the decision to place the position in
the English department was not free of
controversy “It was still a genuine argue
ment within the faculty when I arrived
”980) as to Whether Alro-american
literature was part of the canon of English
literature. That is a positive thing that has
come out of all this. That is no longer an
issue." Frazer said. /

The current dispute arose during the
1983-84 school year when Ken Chambers
temporarily tilled the part-time position.
In its Search for a permanent full-time
iaculty member. the administration chose
not tn interview a white female candidate

for the Afro»arnel'ican position. “Dean
Frazer and I decided it was not ap
propriate to interview a non-black person
because we were not intending to hire a
non-black person It was discriminatory.
and subsequent adVlce Said that it was |Ir
legal." said President George Drake. .

Last year's English Educational Policy
Committee (E RC.) thought the College
was wrong to exclude whites from the
search. and that the iirst priority lay in fin-
ding a qualiﬁed candidate. Earlier James
Kissane resigned his posxtion as Chair of
the department and the recruitment pro
cess was temporarily terminated.

During this brief cessation of recruit-
ment procedures. Chambers was asked to
serve as a temporary fulHime proiessor
so that the college could continue oitering
the courses. in the 193435 school year. the
search was resumed and Chambers was
placed on the list of candidates.

At this time. Drake and Frazer obtained
legal advice saying that the administra-
tion could not prohibit a white person from
the search, “We then made it very clear
that a white candidate would have to be ex-
ceptional.” Drake said. Concurrently,
Chambers was suspended from teaching in
November of 1984. and consequently. was
removed irom candidacy. However, the
1934-85 screening process proved suc-
cessful. There were three black can-
didates. two of whom were offered the
Aircramerlcan position.

Thus. we arrive at the current dispute:

both black candidates turned down the
position and the next candidate was a
highly qualitied white man. He had exten-
sive experience in teaching Afro-american
literature and had tenure at another in-
stitution. The English Department cur-
rently chaired by Elizabeth Dobbs, wanted
to offer the position to the White candidate.
The Executive Council did not.

Drake. who made the final decision.
decided not to offer the candidate theAfro-
american position based on the recom-
mendations of both Frazer and the Ex-
ecutive Council. A minor factor taken into
consideration when making the decision
was that because the white candidate was
a tenured faculty member. Grinnell would
have been obliged to offer hi‘ a tenure
soon. thereby locking the position. and
stopping the recruitment proceedings per-
manently.

Although all oi the departments agree
that the college needs to conduct a more
vigorous search for minorities in all sear—
ches and in all areas. it is “clear that no
department on campus wants to para
tlcipate in what they view as a restricted
search." according to Frazer.

In response to Drake’s decision. the
English Department discontinued its in-
volvement in the search for What the ad-
ministration understands to be profound
dissatisiactinn with the screening pro
cedures “In this case. they (English

The search is on for a proicssor to iill to

Unlike the controversy that has sul‘»
rounded applicants ior the Airohmerican
Studies Chair. Dcan oi Faculty Catherine
Frazer does not expect any diiilculty in
locating an acceptable candidate to iill the
Women's‘ Studies position When asked
about the chances oi appointing a man to
.the chair, Frazer said that “chances are
astronomically high lhal a woman will be
chosen tbecause ol) the small number ol
m en in women's studies." she believes the
"gender question will be a non-issue" but
said “equal opportunity hiring guidclincs
will be lollowed " .

The nominations are open to professors
in all academic areas. and duties will be
arranged around their specialty alter the
appointment is made. For example. an
E nglish proiessor would be responsible lor
teaching within the English department,
but would be allotted substantial time to.
in Frazer's words. “serve as a catalyst.
introducing the iaculty and students to
women's studies concepts.”

Frazer suggested that the Louise Noun
proiessor would. ior instance. work in
tandem wlth the history department in
developing a women's history class. 0r.
d epending on the goals oi the professor and
iaculty. she might work to relorm a
departmcnt’s curriculum to “better
rellect women’s contributions without
starting a new class." said Erazer It will
be the Noun professor's duty to create in
terest in Women’s Studies. as well as
--hguring in any debate about the direction
of the program.” Frazer continued.

A member oi the Women's Studies Ads
visory Search Committee, education pro-
lessor Roberta Atwell. is one oi the eight
people charged with Screening and inter
viewing applicants. She believes that an
clicctirc collipromise would be to oiler
"wdme '- courses. but to really integrate

dous gap here... nationwide. we are behind
most schools in “omell's studies" and she

The Chair is permanent and a senior-
level appointment. so Frazer said the
committee is looking ior “an experienced
associate professor or iull professor.” Ex-
perience seems to be a major requirement

defeated.” Drake said,

There is a fundamental difference in the
priorities of the administration. and those
of the English Department (and all the
departments in generall. although each
“side” recognizes the needs of the other. It
h as never been a dispute over whether Or
not a white could teach the course ade-
quately, However. it is an administrative
priority to meet the campus' need for a
oualiiied black proiessor, and the college
is willing to wait for the position to be filled
by a black proiessor, said Drake,

Drake further stated that “we have to
report to the trustees... who did create the
position with the intention oi having a
black professor. .The adm istration did
n ot leel at liberty to appoint a white person
to the position... though irom tthe English
Department's) perspective. i understand
their position,"

Members oi the English Department ap—
pear to helievc that not only is the college’s
Screening procedure ineffective, but
discriminatory. It seems clear that the
department found the administration to be
discriminatory when it declined to make
an offer to a highly qualified candidate on
the basis of his being white.

Although it has recognized the need (or
minority proiessors. members of the
English Department apparently maintain
that the courses themselves are more im-
portant than the race of the professor who
teaches it; Afro-american literature ’is
worth teaching on the merits of the subject
alone. not on the merits of the teacher.

Regarding the eilectuality oi the ad-
ministration’s screening process. Frazer
said. “it may be that we didn't search hard

‘ enough. but .. we did succeed in identity

ing minority candidates tor the position.
more so than in any other held... it is
remarkable that we were able to olier the .
position to two black candidates... The
recruitment priority rellects the de lacto

where does it go lrom here? Recruit-
incnt proceedings are at a temporary
stand still Drake and Frazer will bring the,
issue up to the trustees at the next board
in cotiiig in November. "The ball is m the
trustee's court. We've tried to recruit wnh
