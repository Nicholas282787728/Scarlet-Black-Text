The Grinnell Club is a member of
the MidrAmerica Intercollegiate
Volleyball Association, a league of six
teams formed in 1975, The other teams
include Drake, lowa State, Western Ila
linols, Central Missouri State, and
Graceland,

Volleyball teams are classified by
three different levels: AA, A, and B
Several of the league teams are
ranked AA. Graceland is known
as the strongest team in the Midwest.
while Grinnell has been described as
of moderate A Caliber. Graceland is
he only school in the league similar to
Grinnell in size. It. is difficult to main

tain a Club in any small school as
evidenced by the failure of many area
schools, such as Rockhurst and Cor-
nell, to field a team.

However, the Graceland team has
varslt status, going so tar as to scout
playc mm the Kansas City area
junior high schools. “The fact that our
team has existed wltli a steady in-
lerest lor four years, able to compete
with other league teams, really speaks
for itself,” contended Edwalds,

In the past, there has been an
average or 12 players each year, this
year the roster boasts ten, “and we
are the strongest we‘ve ever been,"
added Edwalds But he also points out
that SIX oi this year‘s players are
seniors, and their loss will take its toll
on next year’s squad. One standout on
the team this year is senior Steve
Fernstrom, who has won an honorable

mention on the all-conference team for

the past two years.

The Men's Volleyball Club has
hosted two matches this year The
flrst, in December, was a roundrrobin

tournament with two USVBA teams
from Des Moines and Iowa City, in
which the Grinnell Club won bath mat-
ches. The second match, the first of-
flcal game of the season, was against
a visiting Western Illinois University
team. The Grinnell Club lost the
match, winning the first game, 1543,
but dropping the next game 1715, stun-
ned by a iourteenpoint serving streak.
Western Illinois took the match in the
third game, with a score or 15-9.

Because the team has to work
around strange practice times and
organizing difficulties, like most
sports club members at Grinnell, they
are devoted to the sport itself, and get
pleasure and enjoyment troni just
playing it. “Most oi the new players
have had no previous experience,"
commented one rookie, “but we have
a great timel ”

“We are not as hardcore as a lot of
other clubs," commented Edwalds,
“we play in the true spirit or Grin-
ncll.”

team closed the indoor portion of the
1980 season by placing iourth at the
