From wife to activist

by Scott Hilduia

“When women earn 31 [or every $1
men earn instead of 49 cents; when
women occupy so percent at the seats in
the Iowa Legislature instead of 11 per-
cent; when the governor . . . is as likely
to be a woman as a man; then the time
will have come when we [women] . . .
can compete on even terms with all
Iowans lor the honors in our state.”

Louis Rusenlield Noun made the
above statement upon her induction in-
to the Iowa Women’s Hall of Fame in
1981, Even though tour years have pass-
ed, the words still ring true for Noun
who has been a leading Iowa feminist
for most of the last 50 years,

Following graduation irom Grinnell
in 1929, Noun entered graduate study at
Radcliffe, When she asked the head of
the Harvard art department tor a job
recommendation, he suggested that she
get married. She did.

After such an inauspicious start in a
male dominated society. Noun has been
working full-tilt since in the areas of
civil liberties and women's rights.

Noun was a charter member of the
Des Moines League of Women Voters ——
formed around 1944 7 and has served in
various capacities. including president.
ever since,

After she began to get more involved
in local government in Iowa, Noun con.
sidered running tor city council. she
said while on campus recently. Again
she was encouraged by men to iollow a
more traditional path.

“I talked to some people . . . men,”
Noun said. “The message i gotwas that
I was too controversial, I thought. well
hell, if l'm controversial. I’ll just be
controversial.

“i look back on that experience now
and I realize that it was back before the
Women’s movement. Men were Just not
comfortable with women [in politics]
and l was even an independenteminded
woman which made it even worse,"
Noun said.

Noun cited her involvement with the
Iowa Civil Liberties Union and her
deiense oi student prntestors as the pro-
bable source of controversy surroun-
ding her name,

“When you're defending people who
are defying the draft . . . and people who
take oil their clothes to protest Playboy
[representatives] in Grinnell. this kind

'ol thing makes you controversial in the
community. Noun said. “I guess 1 have
been outspoken on all kinds of issues,"

While Noun was active in the Na
tional Organization for Women, the
group did a study oi the United Way,
she said. They found the organization to
be very secretive with a large part or

the money going to middle-class people.

NOW found that business people. who
were forced to give to the United Way in
a sense, were resenting the organiza
tion and its practices. Noun said, Once
NOW publicized its findings. Noun’s
controversial reputation Was enhanced.

“To attack the United Way, it was
like attacking God. Wiﬂi this kind of
thing, you’re known in the community
as the kind of person who ruffles Hie
water once in a while,” she said.

In 1963 Noun decided to attend law
School in conjunction with her interest
in civil liberties. Noun spent one
semester in law school before dropping-
out because “I couldn’t carry the
books," she said.

in a more serious vein, she explained
that as the only woman in a class of as
men. she wasn't having the best or
times,

“In one class on the first day, the pros
iessor looked at me 7 he knew me —
and said, ‘Excuse me Louise, but
there's always one goddamn woman in
the class.‘ Then he made a very off (:01-
or joke about women," Noun said. “So I
dropped out of that class ”

The role of women has changed
dramatically both in Iowa and the
United States as a whole since 1929,
Noun said. When she graduated, if a
young woman wanted to enter the
business world. she took some typing
and shorthand courses. After a few
years, she said. a woman got married
and became a homemaker and moﬂ'ler.
"At least upper»middle class women
did. There have always been hordes of
women who had to work."

Noun sees the range of opportunities
open to women today as being much
more broad than in the past. This open~
ness 0; choice has its curses as well, she
said. '

“1 know a woman who has two
children and her husband travels a lot,"
Noun said. “She's getting pressure
[ruin her mother-inelaw to go out in the
world and get a job. She's happy stay.
ing at home but knows she’s got the
pressure from the other way around "

Although she sees more women in
politics in the future, Noun doesn’t
think it will be easy going, Women
aren't near where they should be, she
said, As women get more political eXr
perience. they'll get more elective jobs,
but mostly on the local level. she said.»

“A lot of it is economics. Men can tap
into financial resources that women
can't." Noun said. “I think that is the
reason that women are successful on
the local level more than they are on the
national level."

people into two categories,

“The human brain has two contrary
tendencies." she said. “The first is the
curious mind, A curious minded person
lives in constant motion. sometimes
taking risks, always changing. These
people are infrequently bored because
their lives offer them a variety 01 in
terests. The second tendency
dominates in a comfort seeking person.
This type does not take risks and is
always preoccupied with tinding a
secure place in lite.

“The security these people search for
is unattainable." Ferguson said.

She cited an example oi an ex-
perimenter named Fuller who was
unhappy with his plight and decided to
kill himself. At the last minute. Fuller
chose instead to live his life from day to
day as an experiment because he could
always just kill himself.

Visionary Factor encourages people
to change their values so that they live
with more curiosity‘and chance. she
said. Even ii a big opportunity rails
through. the person will be able to pick
herselt up and start again with a new
plan.
