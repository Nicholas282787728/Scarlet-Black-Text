Community Response:
Drugs in Grinnell High

by Justin Lincoln

“From the office of the President right
down to you and me." sings Glenn Frey.
These words describe the paradox~involv~
ing extensive drug and alcohol use and
widespread alarm and concern over the
level or such problems. especially among
the nation‘s youth. Small communities
such as Grinnell are not immune. and
may. in fact. be especially vulnerable,

Grinnell was recently alerted to a possi-
ble drug and alcohol problem in its high
school population by a report released by
Grinnell College Sociology professor Kent
McClelland.

The report. based on a survey conducted
at GHS last spring. revealed that nearly
85% of the students used alcohol. about one
third used tobacco. and a fifth used marir
juana

GHS principal Larry Dixon said the
results are “really not surprising The
students are very casual about their
discussion of parties.” He does
acknowledge the presence or a problem.
“particularly with alcohol."

On a national scale. many. especially
disbelieving parents. are blaming the
schools for not providing adequate educa
tion about the hazards of these substances.

Currently, the high school’s drug educa-
tion exists in "realiired health classes in

9th and 11th grades that address the issues
or drug use and abuse within the context of
broader health Issues," said Dixon.
Biology and Driver's Ed. courses also con-
tribute.

The report indicated that many students
begin using illegal substances before the
age of 15. and Dixon emphasizes the need
to “get information to these kids as early
as possible," As one result the health class
currently offered in 9th grade will be mov-
ed back to 8th grade next year.

Gl'lS Student Council President Mark
Brown is making a similar. though more
concerted. eliort. He is organizing a pro
gram in which he and other high school
students will speak to 5th and 6th graders
candidly about drug issues “We’re trying
to bring the problem out lor them. and
make them aware of peer pressures." he
said.

Police Sergeant Doug Shutts. who serves
as a liaison officer to the school's'tand who
is on the school board, heads a small scale
educational process which begins in
kindergarten At this stage, the children
“learn the basic hazards of poisons.

Expert Criticizes us.

POlicy Toward
- Terrorism

by May»iee Chai

Gerard Chaliand. a French journalist
and author of over 20 books, spoke on
“Coping with Terrorism" on Monday, Dec.
1. Speaking without notes, Chaliand outlin-
ed the growth of “terrorisms” throughout
the world and concluded that although a
“phenomenon that
estimated... (by the) measure of noise it’s
been able to achieve, it is a remarkable
success.“

“You cannot eliminate completely ter-
rorism. It's part of the picture. However.
I believe it‘s bad. it‘s counterproductive to
be blackmailed by hostage taking. 0n
those grounds I believe the state of Israel
has the soundest policy," he said.

in an interview with the S and B.
Chaliand criticized the sale of arms to Iran
in exchange for the release of two
American hostages in Lebanon, “If the
President is going to do that ki of thing.
he should not lie about it. And if it was for
a geopolitical purpose, they should not
have brought the hostages into it."
Chaliand said.

He feels it will be viewed as an “invitar
tion" for other groups to take hostages.
“What would you do? You would try it, of
course,” he said.

However. he does not feel the opposite
Stance of “no negotiating with terrorists”
advocated by some politicians as in the
case of Secretary of State Schultz is effec-
tive either. “It is not wrong to talk.
Negotiating is not itself had, it is
necessary for governments... but to give
up to that kind of blackmail is' bad," he
said.

Chaliand feels that terrorism has been a
“success" in its ability to destablilize not
the sta‘ie but Hie mind. He cites the deline

is highly over».

in Americans traveling to Europe last year
as an example.

"After all in this country there is (ap-
proximately) 60.000 .homicides every
year. In France. app mately 50 people
were killed to terrorism last year.
don't see why one shouldn’t go to Paris."
he said.

Chaliand feels there is a “big
difference" between the attitudes of
Americans and Europeans concerning ter»
rorism. He cited historic heritages but
especially media coverage as the cause.

He says the U.S. media is concerned only
with the spectacle of terrorist acts and not
the causes. He said it was a “shame" that
there were no specialists to speak about
terrorists on the news “when they have
specialists for weather reports."

The U.S. is behind Western Europe in
this respect as media reports tend to ig-
nore the historical and other ~legitimate
claims behind many terrorist actions. The
us. considers it “just a moral problem
and its all bad...wants to retaliate
overall,” he said.

In order to combat “terrorism: 7 there
Should be an ‘5' there." Chaliand stressed
the need for "intelligence.” This means
recognizing that there are three basic
types: transnational. which stems from
the Middle East; regional terrorism, such
as the Basques in Spain and the IRA in
Ireland; and the ideological sects, such as
the Red Brigades in Italy and Action
Directe in France.

QThere is a big difference between
groups with backing and those that have
no backing, For example. the ma has
some popular support The PLO has some
backing-among the Palestinian people...

Campus Repblicans
Voice Concerns

by Dave Jones

“If you’re a conservative on this cam~
pus. you've got to know what it is you
believe in and be able to defend it.” says
senior Russ Matteson. chairman of the
Grinnell College Republicans. An ongoing
controversy at Grinnell has been the coir
lege community’s response to conser-
vative views and opinions

Facing an overwhelmingly Democratic
campus both in the student body and the
faculty. campus Republicans have stress-
ed over the years their displeasure _with
what they see as an inequality in the
political atmosphere of the college com-
munity. Matteson voices a concern that
some of the teaching faculty or the college,
which includes only one registered
Republican, are inclined at times to stress
their personal views in a narrow-minded
way.

“There are several (professors) who use
their position to pass out their views
without there being a chance for
response," he adds.

The criticism does not' end with the
faculty. “A frustrating area is the student

body.” Matteson says, where there is a
tendency to be “decidedly ignorant' on the
issues of the day. A good example ol the
frustration the Republicans feel is evident
whenever President Reagan speaks to the
nauon

As a Republican, Matteson says he is
perceived by many Democrats or liberals
to hold the some opinions as Reagan on all
issues or to b e a die-hard Reagan supr
porter, He stresses that he is not the lone
victim of this misconception. “Most of the
conservatives and Republicans may not be
Ronald Reagan fans but they believe in
standing by their elected officials" he
adds.

According to Matteson. some of the
greatest injustices done to the conser-
vative element oi the campus since he has
been here have come from the Scarlet and
Balck ”The S and B over the four years
has been incredibly unfair to the conser-
vatives.” One example of this harassment

Trustee Wants to Buy
$100 million Business

by Mary Lea Crawley

Some might call it a Nebraska state of
mind: live simply. know thyself and
never forget that shareholders are human
too. For Warren Buffett, an invaluable
trustee of Grinnell. Omaha is where it’s at
and simple is the way to be.

Perhaps that's why the three—quarter
page ad in the November 17 Wall Street
Journal was bordered with fine print that
said "advertisement.” With no photos,
graphics, or even block letters screaming
Sell Now, Buffett's 547.000 ad was, as
himseli, unpretentious.

Looking for new corporate acquistions,
Warren Buffet. Chief Executive Officer of
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and the fifth
wealthiest man in America hopes to take
advantage of the upcoming changes in the
tax code.

“We want to buy businesses worth $100
million or more before December 31, 1986"
read the first line of the enlarged business
letter. As effective tax rates on business
owners who sell out after ’86 may be in
creased to a steep 52.5%. Buiiett urges
those planning to sell to do so immediately.

Buffett is personal and frank throughout
the ad. even in the way he outlines his pur-
chasingcriteria. Hewill only considersim-
ple businesses: “if there’s lots of

. technology. _. we .won't . understand it."

Those interested parties who meet the
halfvdozen criteria are invited to call Buf-
fett or, “if you like, first call Mrs.
Kaiser...to request express delivery of
Berkshire Hathaway’s annal report.” In-
stead of the 1r800roperatorrwillrhe—
standingby method made famous by
Farwell. Buffett uses a more intimate ap~
proach. Mrs. kaiser.

For Warren Buffett. a man worth $1.4
billion. recent recognition in Forbes 1936
Special Edition does not warrant a “new"
look. Said Business Week. he is “an
amiable unpretentious sort with the
rumpled look of an eccentric professor."

Married and the iather of three. Buffett
is at home in the modest house he bought
31 years ago in Omaha. Unlike the typical
Wall Street aristocrat. he prefers burgers
and Cherry Coke to the traditional three
martini lunch.

But if he’s not at Harry’s at Hanover
hanging outwith the boys. how does he get
the dirt-rthe inside rap which makes suc—
cessful investors brilliant?

Buffett rejects the inside info which
keeps Ivan Boesky-types hopping. His in»
vestment success is due to a value-
oriented philosophy taught by Benjamin
Graham in the 1948 text, The intelligent In-
