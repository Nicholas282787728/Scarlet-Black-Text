remarked
Because or her he to the college. a large
part at Zimmermans study concentrated
on Grinnell. "There was a distinct iemalc
culture at Grinnell during these years,"
she said "President Main‘s report to the
trustees suggested that the college should
acknowledge the special needs at the
women,“ Zimmerman explained
Main, in tact, wrote in 1927. “In spite oi
the tranchise recently given to twomeni,
in spite or the new avenues oi service open
to them out in the world. women will con

lecture entitled “Daughters 0! Main

described one interesting and outspoken
