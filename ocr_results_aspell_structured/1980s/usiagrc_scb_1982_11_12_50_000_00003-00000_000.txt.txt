S.C.A. hosts maior tourney

by Kim MacDonald

A tournament, the selection of a prince
and a medieval banquet in Grinnell?
Sound a bit far-fetched? Not really, for this
weekend 200 to 250 lords and ladies from a
four state reg'on will descend on Grinnell
to fight, feast and make merry.

This weekend's event, The Society for
Creative Anachronism Calontir Coronet, is
hosted by the Grinnell chapter of S.C,A., a
nationwide organization. Beginning at 11
a.m. tomorrow in the middle gym oi the
P.E.C., 32 iighters will compete in a tour-
nament to determine a winner to be crown-
ed prince of Calontir, a principality in-
cluding lowa, Nebraska, Missouri and
Kansas.

Of the 32 contestants, two Grinnellians
and one alumnus will be among the par
ticipants. Society member and contender
Fretheim explained that the 32 were
selected “for fighting prowness" by the
present prince and regional oiiicers during
the past year.

Also in the middle gym, medieval arts
and sciences contests will be 'on display
throughout the day. Exhibits in numerous
areas including calligraphy, armory and
needlecratt will be among the are judged
at the end of the day.

Anachronism means “anything happen-
ing out of its proper or historical time.”
According to society member Carla
Tilghman, S.C.A.‘s purpose is the “selec-
tive recreation of the Middle Ages." She
said, “People learn about the Middle Ages
and have events which recreate the

The Griunell Review staff has
modiﬁed its submissions guidelines.
previously the stair requested that all
manuscripts be retyped for submisr
sion; now, however, the Review Stall
will make arrangements if retyping is
not possible.

Editor Beth Vilen emphasized the
need to eliminate all comments from
papers which have been graded to en-
sure objectivity on the part oi the selec-
tions committee. Two copies of each en-
try are necessary.

Vilen also said submissions for the
Review have been very slow and this
may give those who do submit their
work a better chance of inclusion in the
next issue.

Review revises policy

At 4:15 today in Loose Hall Lounge,
“Veterans Remember the War," will
be the topic of a panel discussion
presented by members of the Des
Moina Chapter of Vietnam Veterans of
Iowa.

At a pm tonight in South Lounge,
there will be a panel discussion on
“Vietnam: Historical and Political
Perspectives," between Lloyd Gardner
and Col. Harry Summers.

 

desirable parts" of the time from “the
Romans to the Elizabethans." Tilghman
stressed that there are “no strict rules”
and “personal preierencc" largely deter-
mines which time period and aspecu of
that age on which members focus. She
noted that there are a lot of Vikings on the
Grinnell campus.

Approximately three years ago, the
Grinnell Chapter, Shire Gno Mountain was
iounded by a few people interested in
medieval combat. They submitted a pro
posal to the national S.C.A. organization
ior approval and organized their
members. Fretheim explained that there
is “a large diversity in the membership”
of the nationwide organization, from
“students to professionals, including
lawyers and doctors, to wage laborers."

Grinnell was selected to host the Coronet
event because of the success or previous,
smaller events held‘ here in the past.
“Everyone had a good time," at the past
tournaments according to Fretheim.

The festivities will culminate in a
medieval banquet on Saturday in the Grin-
nell Community Center. Tickets are $9 [or
anyone who makes arrangements and
comes “dressed in garb” or looks like it,
but Fretheim believes the banquet will be
sold out by the morning of the event.

So if you're passing through the P.E.C.
on Saturday, don't be surprised it you hear
some unusual noises. It’s just some lords
vying ior me tide of prince or this region.

Drake suggests" plans for Grinnell’s future

by Ellen Heath

As part oi the college's planning process
President George Drake has presented a
paper to the iaculty, administration and
Board of Trustees concerning his ideas
about the future of the college.

Drake listed four strengths he feels Grin~
nell students should possess after atiJenr
ding this school: analytical and critical
thinking, quantitative reasoning and coma
munication skills. From these skills he
hopes students will have attained the abili-
ty to “transcend. . . personal experiences
to participate in the experience and
understanding of the ages,” an understan~
ding oi American as well as other
cultures; intellectual maturity and an
“awareness of personal and social
values."

The president is concerned that the
faculty be “teaching scholars, at least a
half-dozen of whom have national reputa-
tions.” The size of the iaculty ought to be
large enough to furnish “outstanding" ma-
jors and “service and general education
courses." Drake expressed the opinion
that the college now has a need for addi-
tional facilities in certain areas and “We
should meet these needs as redistribution
o! the faculty and linancial resources per-
mil."

Improvement 0! the library collection
and "academic equipment” is also a
priority. The president believes Grinncll’s
computing program should be strengthen-
ed as well, in order to ”establish com-

puting as one or the hallmarks oi a Grin-
nell education.”

According to Drake, recruitment should
connnuc to be national, with a greater eta
fort in increase the number of Iowans in at
tendence, The comprehensive fee for the
college should stay in the lower half of the
approximately so ”nationally recognized
liberal arts colleges,” Drake said. He also
mentioned that Grinnell should strengthen
its “image and admissions program to
continue to attract a diverse and high
quality student body."

The president said Grinnell should oiier
many strong extracurricular activities so
students and prospectives will not be
dissatisfied with particular activities.
However, he added that there must be a
limit to the number of activities, determin-
ed by the number ot students participating
and the “goals and finances of the

college." Grinnell ought to offer a quality '

program and “should not try to be all
things to all people."

In discussing Grinnell’s distinguishing
characteristics, Drake said that one of this
college’s “identifying marks” is its “cons-
cience.” This conscience “guides our ap-
proach to both internal and external
issues," the president said.

!ncluded in the paper is a list of definite

and proposed work to be done on campus
buildings. Next summer the Gale Obser-
vatory will be built and Grinnell House will
be renovated. Younker Hall work should
also be finished then. Renovations in the
Fine Arts Basement, to improve safety,
provide a better storage place for some of
the college's art collection and to improve
the theater department lacilities, may also
be done next summer.

Other renovation suggations that the
president offered include redoing Good»
now as a classroom/office building when
the psychology department moves to
larger quarters, restoration of Mears Hall
to house the Admissions Office, new win-
dows and a mechanical system {or ARH, a
new computer center, possibly part or a
new psychology building and a possible
third floor addition to Fine Arts for an art
gallery to be built within the next five to in
years.

To bolster Grinnell’s “strong develop-
ment program. . . " Drake said, the
amount oi “The alumni giving to the An-
nual Fund should be increased significant-
ly." He said recent alumni should be en-
couraged to give more. The college is also
focusing on corporate giving. This year
more of an chart was made with Des
