’ -Kevin McKeoug/a

Under normal circumstances, students'
response to the Shakin’ Pyramids would
have left me, a veteran observer of Grin-
nell social rituals, shaking my head. Una
fortunately, my head still hasn't returned
from wherever it went during the
festivities that followed the concert. My
cranium was kind enough to leave a.note
for me on my pillow, which was the first
place I looked upon discovering it was
gone. Don’t blame me if you don’t like
what it said. We never did get along
anyway,

Tuesday night's concert appearance by
the shakin' Pyramids prompted an un-
precedented degree of enthusiasm among
the student body. Twenty minutes before
the band mok the stage, in other words, at
the time the Shakin’ Pyramids were
scheduled to appear, North Longe and the

Forum Grill were filled, not only with
students, but also with an atmosphere of
heightened anticipation and eagerness.
The ensuing performance resulted in the
soaring of room temperatures, violations
of legal room capacity, and horrendously
loud clatter which invariably indicates
that somebody is having a wonderful time,
Many such somebodies continued to have

The Israeli

One of ﬁle first things one hears when
discussing Israel with an opponent of
Israeli policy is, ”Oh my Lord, what moral
monsters! How can you support such bar-
barians? They murder innocent women
and Children! ” Without going into the
United States‘ own “morally reprehensi-
ble” acts, let us consider the above ques-
tion for a moment and then disregard it.

First, we must assume that all agree
Israel is at war with the Arab World, Ac-
cepting this, we must also realize that a
war can only be fought by two parties, or
more in the case of the Arab-Israeli con
flict. Third, in war, as in all violence, some
innocent people are bound to get hurt. It is
strange how Syrians and Palestine Libera-
tion Orgainzation terrorists who hide out in
hospitals and schools with machine guns
can convince the world that they are inno-
cent victims of Israeli aggression, (which
they have the audacity to term Nazilike),
while the Israelis, surrounded by ag~
gressors who outnumber them io-torone,
are portrayed as a cruel~ and ruthless
millitary machine.

one thing is quite certain: both the PLO
and the Israelis are cruel. Cruelty is an
unavoidable ingredient of war, and
anybody who does not believe this is naive.
Thus, any argument that has as its
premise that the Isrealis are cruel is‘proV
bably valid, but quite irrelevant.

The crucial problem With our way of
thinking is that we try to impress upon the
Middle East, half a world away, the same
sets of criteria that we apply to ourselves.
This is a foolish, and I might add
dangerous, way to view the issue. The
United States is not surrounded, at least
not directly, by a bevy of nations poised to
destroy it at the appearance of weakness,
Nor is the United States faced with the
reminder of six million lost relations, who
to the United States were foreign victims
of the actions of bad, bad man. Few

wonderful times in a number of post-
concert celebrations that lasted much
later than niey probably should have, and
made a dreadfully large amount of money
for the Pub.

All of which is completely irrelevant. It
is the reasons why the Shakin' Pyramids
prompted such a reaction that are impor-
tant, Credit, of course, must be accorded
to the band itself, which put on a fine show.
Yet the quality of die performance is only
one of several factors which resulted in the
evening's events. Many students simply
welcomed such a golden opportunity to put
studies aside,

Ultimately, a far subtler element than
those cited proved the crucial facet in
Tuesday night’s frolic. The sheer novelty
of the entire affair, from the band’s ins
congruous origin to their unprecedented
weeknight scheduling, made the dance a
major event of surprising magnetism,

Yet the great likelihood is that neither
those who warmly welcomed the band, nor
those who were unable, or undesiring , to
attend, will be presented with so unique
(good Lord. ,. ) a diversion again this
semester. Unless they create such a diver
sion themselves, which doesn’t seem like

Question

ly,

On this campus, it is entirely too easy to
slide into a routine in which the same ac-
tivities are repeated with the same people,
day after day. what makes the existence
of such routines so uniortunate is that most
Grinnell students have enough intellectual
and creative ability to provide themselves
with original, and more potentially Ina
tereSting, amusements than mose regular
ly provided by concerts, the Pub, films,
etc. The anonymous prank played last
semester, in which bogus invitations to a
pizza and beer dinner at President Drake’s
house, is an example of a way in which
students amused themselves in an in»
novative, albeit mischievous, manner.

I’m not suggesting that Grinnell be turn»
ed into a campus full of prankstei's over-
night, or that students need to indulge in
the sort of excesses traditionally
associated with “having a good time." I'm
suggesting that spontaneity, lm~
pulsiveness, imagination and the will-
ingness to take a few risks are every bit as
important an aspect of life at Grinnell as
those daily features that most of us have
long come to take for granted.

Americans found themselves on Cyprus in
1947. bereft of all their belongings and
waiting to be shipped to a land even far»
ther away, in a desert (reminiscent of the
American Indian), in a land that hated
them, ‘

From the frying pan into the fire, from a
Europe bent on the destruction, to a land of
dust surrounded by enemies. In 1948, when
first attacked, Israel defended itself
against impossible odds, surprising not one
ly the Arabs but the rest of the world as
well. The world was surprised that they
won. Surprised.

Keeping all of this in mind. mat there is
a war in the region and all of the countries,
including Israel, participate in it, and that
the Jews are only defending what nobody
thought they could keep, why should we
support them’! It is my contention that we
should support the nation for at least three
reasons: It is a democracy, it is the only
stable government in the region and ‘it age
gresslvely halts Soviet adventurism in the
region

Israel is a democracy. the Arab states
are not. While the general policies of die
Israeli government are not always shared
by the United States, the fact remains that
Israeli policy is a tunction of its people.
The Knesset is the people's voice, peoples’
voices are heard and peoples‘ rights are
respected, In other parts of the region, the
destinies of millions are decided by the
whims of kings, sometimes cruel,
sometimes not.

In Israel, they have newspapers to cen-
sor. In Arab states they have censors for
newspapers. In Israel, the prime minister
is subject to a confidence vote (which he
seems to face quite often). It is in the ins
terests of democracy everywhere to guard
against totalitarianism and
authoritarianism, such as is practiced by
the Arabs and their “Ally,” the Soviet
Union. And please. the fact that the United

States supports other dictatorships has no
relevance whatsoever to this argument.
Unlike other governments in the region,
Israel‘s government is stable. The Saudi
government, for example, is based on
hereditary monarchy, and when the cur-
rent king dies, his heir will inherit the
throne. Unfortunately, there are at least
five different people who claim they are
the heirs, all claiming they were born first,
Since there are not birth records, guns will

probably decide the outcome of events.

Iran and Iraq are at war, Jordan's king
is facing serious'political problems, Syria
is stable, (or at least as stable as Arab
governments get), but in the Soviet camp,
Libya is run by a madman, and Egypt has
recently had its president assassinated.
Alone among them, Israel has an elected
assembly that is effective and not depenr
dent on its prime minister, who can easily
be replaced. Also, Israel will never betray
us; it has too much to lose, and has the in-
telligence to realize it,

The Israeli government is the only
government that can effectively counter
Soviet interventionism, The great bear to
the north has increasingly become a threat
since die dissolution of the Iranian govern-
ment and the invasion of Afghanistan,
Syria has been heavily supplied with
Soviet weapons and weapons experts,
Israel's army is the only one in the area
that has ever shown itself capable of
repulsing attack The Soviets would win,
no question, but not without heavy losses
and possible nuclear retaliation,

One more note. I have heard some
Zionists support Israeli bombing, while at
the same time criticize Arab bombing. I do
not subscribe to this. Bombs are never
moral. However, in a war, bombs are us-
ed. It is either immoral for both to use
them (my opinion) or moral for both.
There can be no double standard, We must

. support Israel for ideological reasons, not

for the morality of its bombs.

The very first ilisue of the 5&3 of the
1981-82 school ye! ‘ad a fabulous quote
from an obscure '..riter. It said something
to the effect of, “I see that over the sum-
mer, houses owned by the college received
some additions. What an incredibly .
original idea. Wooden fire escapes."

I think an entire award could be built
around that concept. The Wooden Fire
Escape Award for the most incredibly
original idea of the yur. This year's reci~
pient would have been KLVN Newton, a
radio station, that offers color weather
radar. A radio station.

Speaking of ﬁns obscure writer, in that
very same column, something was men
tioned about how expensive textbooks are.
I just found out why. Its not because they
pay the authors anything or because it
c053 so much to print books, It's because
publishing houses dump loads of money in-
to gifts for professors.

Sure, everyone knows that professors
get their books tree. But for every book a
prof uses in class, he or she gets four, five,
six or more books that aren‘t used, The
publishing house will send a prot a copy of
a book just to look It over and decide
whether it should be used or not. Some of
these freebies are solicited, some not. ,
I And not only textbooks. Dictionaries,
thesauruses (thesaurusi7), and calendars
are popular presents. And multiply that by
every professor in the nation.

Then, to top it on, the student has to buy
three, four or five books for one class. O.K.
fine, so courses are usually more diverse
man any one book. But I’m Still frustrated
when [see one of the books I'm using cited
as a source in another.

I was in Chicago over Christmas break. I
think there‘s potential there for someone
selling bumper stickers. Well, at least this
special bumper sticker: “Don‘t blame me.
I voted for Carter . . . . Four times."
a...”unusuusuusnmmums-c
Sales Clerk: Here’s a nice Valentine, “To
the only boy I ever loved,"

Young girl: That sounds nice. I'll take
twelve. ,

Great, it's Valentine time again. That
time of year we try to make sure not to of-
fend anybody.

What am I talking about? Last year I
was offended. Five times,

I guess I'm kind of cynical when it comes
to Valentine's Day. It doesn't help when I
see how Valentine cards have changed.
They don't say things like, “I love you.”
“Be My Valentine” or “I'm 4 U." They
says things like, “I hope all your wishes _
come true during oils special time, Happy
Valentine‘s Day." That’s not a Valentine
card, That’s a Christmas card, Or a birth-
day card, Or a wedding/confirmation/Bar
Mitzvah/graduation/Flag Day card (cir-
cle appropriate occasmn).

It’s a bland, noncommittal card that can
appeal to a lot ot people, A generic card. A
card that, like American beer, offends as
few people as possible. A card anyone can
send to anyone else and be safe.

There you go. Safety. Everyone’s afraid

to say anything emotional to anyone else
for fear the other party will “get the wrong
idea." Yeah, a Valentine card is only a half
step away from marriage.
’ “God this is stupid! " you're probably
saying. “ﬂagging on Valentine's Day, just
because five women didn’t send him a card
last year.”

I don't know. Maybe you’re right.
