From the class of ’69 to Sudan:
John Gareng and the PMLS

Based on “LeMonde” report

by Christel iibiot and Todd Perry

Today, Sudan is faced with a number of
major problems. The [amine and shortage
of food is getting worse while the country is
getting deeper and deeper in debt.
lslamification has stifled Sudan's
economy as well as breeding discontent
among its people,

.iohn Gareng, who graduated from Grinr
hell in 1969, is probably the most well
known person in Sudan after President
Marshall Nemeiry. Gareng is the head oi
the Southern Sudanese insurrection.

There, one of his high school friends
describes him as “Being a discreet and
lonely person who was not very interested
with the movement that the guerillas were
leading against the government in the six
ties.

So instead or joining the guerillas, he
decided to go to the United states. Upon his
return in 1070 from his first stay in the
United states Gai'eng joined the
separatist movement oi Anya Nya in
Southern Sudan.

In 1971. Gareng received military train-
ing in Israel At that time Israel was help-
ing the Anya Nya rebels against the
government of Sudanese President
Nemeiry which was then in alliance with
the communists groups of that country.

Once the communists were eliminated.
there was a reconciliation between the
separatist movement oi Anya Nya and the
Nemeiry’s government. This reconcilia»
tinn was formalized with the agreements
of Addls Abeba in March 1972,

Aiter these accords were signed.
Gareng, as well as many other members of
Anya Nya. joined the Sudanese Army.
During that time he went to the United
States twice. He visited Fort Benin.
Georgia, to improve his military educa
tion. He also went to Iowa State University
to get a doctorate in economics.

When he returned to Sudan in 1981, he
was appointed head of the research
department tor the Sudanese Army and
taught agricultural economy at the
University of Khartoum.

On May 16, 1933. Gareng went
underground. He suriaced on Jilly 3lst and
put forth a program for the formation of
the Popular'Movement for the Liberation
of Sudan (PMLS).

With the announcement or this program.
the Popular Army for the Liberation of
Sudan (PALS) was formed and began acts
of" aggression against the Sudanese
government,

What was the purpose of the insurrecr
tionl For years many former members or
Anya Nya thought that the Addis Abeha

.agreements had been violated by the
government. Following these accords, the

Sudanese economic situation had been get- ‘

‘ing worse. The poverty was increasing
while, because at governmental corrupr
tion. development projects were not effecr
tive.

The event which catalyzed the hostil es
was Marshall Nemeiry's decision not to in-
stall an oil reﬁnery in the Southern town of
Bantiu Where all had been discovered.
Because of this decision, the money deriv-
ed from oil refining would go to the govern
merit in the North rather than to the
Southern population,

To add to an already tense situation.
Nemeiry decided to divide the Southern
semi-autonomous areas into three
separate parts in order to weaken the
region.

In June 1983. the government further
heightened the national crisis by introducr
ing the lslamie penal code Because the
Southerners are Christians or Animists
and very attached to their beliefs.
customs. and autonomy, they resented
such measures.

Gareng's first goal was to “free Sudan
from Nemeiry's dictatorship . . and
from “. the exploitation and
underdevelopment." The genius of
Gareng, according to his partisans and op-
ponents. is that his program strives tor all
the people oi the South: Arabs. Blacks.
Moslems, and Christians.

The PMLS program offers three dit-
ferent objectives to attain this goal:
democracy, socialism. and secularism.

The wealth is distributed among people ‘

without regard to their race or religious all
fillation

Gareng differs irom his predecessors in’
that he does not want the South to Seceded
in view oi the provindependence teelings in
the Western and Eastern parts of the coun i
try, as well as in the South Gareng is
ﬁghting for national unity. Fol Gareng this‘
is the only solution where he can provide
for all the interests of the South and the
North r

The only solution for Gareng is to get
help from the other African countries lid
has obtained arms irom Libya and
military training camps from Ethiopia

In the first four months of the oftensivo
he recruited guerillas from diflerent
groups. These groups aie all united now.’
This unity is the key to the strength or
Gareng and the PMLS

Everyday, more and more people lrom
different backgrounds are joining the
PMLS such as northern Muslims and
soldiers and officers from the Sudanese
Army. Gareng has approximately 7.000 to
10.000 well-armed and welltrained men,
Gareng’s men are not trying to occupy the
whole territory. Rather. they are iorcinp
the regular Army to stay in its garrisons
with bombing. attacks and ambushes. ‘

The Northern Sudanese army has been
forced to limit itself to defensive reprisals.
Gareng s guerillas now control two of the.
three Southern regions. In February 1004.
the PALS gained control of the Southern oil
fields formally controlled by the govern»
ment.

Now that the PALS controls the Southern

oil fields. it has deprived Nemeiry's
government oi a substantial source or
capital.
Nemeily cannot negotiate with the rebelﬂ
because he lost his credibility with them
The rebels think he violated the Addis
Abeba agreements of 1982.

Nemeiry would like to light back but he
cannot increase the “31‘ effort because an
important part oi his army is already
engaged in the South. He cannot afford to
increase military spending

Nemeiry asked for help from the United
States but Washington is not ready to ge.
involved in the mess. He also asked for
help lrbm Libya and Ethiopia but both
refused. ‘

Nemeiry's current preoccupation is to
prevent the guerillas irom increasing then:
influence in the northern parts of the coun;
try where all political parties but one .
the Mulsims Brothers e are against him.

Nelnciry s only choice is to maintain his
politics of islamification. in the hope that
the ”djihad" iHoly war) which he has
declared. will allow hiln to put down the in-
fidels.
