The Human Element

Kicking at my desk leg, I aller-
nately clenched my fists and
stretched my fingers. I tapped my
pcncil,chewwthecrdscrforawhilc,
then stared off at. the alphabetic
row of cursive characters stretch-
ing around theroom. “A a“ started
above the blackboard, high up on
the wall. Colorful bulletin boards
with turkcycutrotlts and

at Barton Elementary.

We were called back in by the
bell, and pumlnclled our way back
to to our scars. As the classroom
settled. Mrs. Lewis called the roll,
then announced a special activity
for the afternoon, “Everybody,
today Jimmy Duncan has agreed to
tap-dance for us." All heads swiv-
eled silently. l sauntercd

front of me. “If I spit wet paper

wondered, “will shecut my tongue

then tell on me?" Naw. She'd do
something worse, like forcefccd‘

together. I almost wanted to try.
The bell saved her. And me.

At lunch recess, my classmates
mocked me. Clayton Reid picked
his noscand tried to smear it on my
shirt. “No, wipe iton Sara Static,"
I told him, Everyone called her
"Static Cling" because she‘d peed
her skirtone day, and the fabric had
stuck to her thighs. Taken with the
idea, he chased her around the
swings holding out his booger—
slimed ﬁnger. Brian Ash said I
looked funny. “00 look in a mir-
ror," I said. He punched me in the
chest and'askcd why I was dressed
the way I was.

I had created a sensation earlier
when I ripped between the bike
racks before school on my green
roadster, laying down a seven-foot
black skid of smoking rubber,

But because I‘was sporting scar-

and a red bow tie, My silver cane
was laid across the handlebars I
had made my entrance.

stairs varnished cxccsr
sivcly with glitter, a top hat. Dad
had dropped them off that mom-
mg.
I was ready, cocky. and conﬁr
dent. A showman. I turned to my
audience, my classmates...

A'nd froze. Theircxpcctant faces
and watchrul eyes drilled into my
heart. Mrs. Lcwis started the mu-
sic. A tinny, hissed version of
“Hello Dolly“ blarcd from the re-
corder. But rigor mortis had stiff-
ened my costumed corpse. And I
stood there. She stopped the song.
“Jimmy? Are you ready?"1gaped
at the rows and rows of people, the
huge theatre, plush diapings of
velvet cunains, dangling crystal
chandeliers. . . All eyes on me, All
quiet, “Next.please.“ My imagi-
nation‘sdircctor motionedme from
the stage,

Then I picked out a single face,
a smile. Kelly Stoner. Just like all
the guys, I had always cupped my
hands and made loud vomit»noises
at the mention of girls. But she was
different. Ithink weall liked Kelly
secretly.

Mrs. Lewis had rewound Lhe
tape. “Ready now?" she asked
again. Inoddcd blankly. Themusic
began, . .

The' nextday Kelly called me a
fart-face, and I kicked her, which
meant that we were “going steady."
That was until the next year when
Jason Flabcn threw gravel down
her blouse.

Oh, and the tap routine? Even
todaylcan‘tremembcrclearly those
20 minutes.

But they say this carrot-haired
kid put on a hell ofa show.

“I'm saying we would have
heterosexual couples, not for-
mally married, who would want
to move off campus,“ answered
Drake. When the students coun-
tered by pointing out that the
C81. housing policy's criteria
were legal marriage for hetero-
sexual couples and insiitlltionally
sanctioned marriage for homor
sexual couples, he said, “If we
had institutionally sanctioned
homosexual couples moving off
campus, I’m saying, (it) would
be perceived by many heterosexn
ual couples as not a legitimate
reason and their own perception
would be the basis of their re-
qucsts, ‘We’rc not legally mar-
ried, but we're committed to each
other.m ’

Drake also clariﬁed a previous
comment about the expense in-
volved in legal marriages. exr
plaining that when heterosexual
couples marry, their parents say,
“Okay, you're on your own."
Brown responded that many gay
students are thrown out of their
homes and that Drake did not
“understand the gay experience.“

On Wednesday, the second
group of students met with
Drake, while approximately 50
others demonstrated outside, To
emphasize their belief that Drake
was neither listening to student
opinion nor saying anything
new, part of the group silently
demonstrated in Drake's office.
Upon entering the ofﬁce, the
students asked. “Are you going to
change the housing policy?” Af»
ter Drake's negative reply, the
students held hands and sat

silently listening to the outside
clapping and chanting.

At one point, the outside
demonstrators began to strike the
sides of Nollen House. At 3:45
pm. KDIC played an edited
recording of the Monday meeting
to provide evidence for the
demonstrators‘ belief that Drake
was simply repeating himself.

After 29 minutes of silence,
the group inside asked Drake if

After 29 minutes of silence.
the group inside asked Drake if
the past 30 minutes had changed
his mind. When he said that it
had not, the students left. They
and most of the other protesters
then tried to schedule further
meetings with him.

Drake told the Scarlet and
Black that he would not bow to
the pressure of the demonstra-
tions. “It becomes a question of
pressure,” he said. “If I change
my mind because of pressure and
not because I change my mind
genuinely, I don‘t think that's a
strong basis for changing.“

He emphasized that it was
within his right to veto the CSL
policy. “I guess the fact that it’s
a recommendation, there’s a deci-
sion to be made, means that it
could go at least two ways. It
could be yes, It could be no. I

suppose it could be maybe or
we’ll wait awhile," he said.
“There are options, yes or no, and
occasionally thCre'll be a no."
Despite strained relations with
SGA and the rest of the Student
body, he insists that he stands by
his decision.

The demonstrators have said
that they will continue actively
to protest the housmg policy
Change, mostly due to what they
consider, its homophobic and re-
strictive nature. Students at a
planning meeting discussed
growing more militant as time
progresses.
