Alumni Fear

Terrorism:

Cancel Trip to Greece

by John Harrison

Because of concerns about the travel
safety in the Mediterranean, President
George Drake and the College Alumni Dir
fice has decided to indefinitely postpone its
Alumni AssoCiation tour to Greece
scheduled for June [1725.

Drake said, “We are postponing the trip
because we just don't feel secure about
traveling in the Mediterranean world this
summer, especially with the recent in-
cidents.” In this letter to the Alumni dated
April 2, Drake stated, “recent events in
the Gulf of Sidra and subsequent threats
from Mr, Khadafy have convinced me that
the Mediterranean world is too unsettled to
risk the trip this summer,” Drake said.
“given the tensions in that area and the
feeling about Americans, we didn't feel
that it was responsible to take a group of
twenty Americans through Athens Airport
to travel it .rreece “

The tour was the idea of Curtis Lamb ’27
to recognize Grinnell‘s long association
with Anatolia College in Salonika, Greece.
by paticipating in its centennial celebra»
tion this year. In the 1920‘s and 1930's,
Grinnell participated in an exchange pro,
gram with Anatolia College and has main-
tained close contact through the years.

Gerald Lalonde, classics and East Asian
languages professor was to be one of the
leaders of the trip this summer. Lalonde
said that he wasn't surprised by the deciv
sion not to go to Greece and expressed his
belief that the college was acting respon-
sibly. Lalonde said that American tours in

Europe are more conspicuous than others
and prime targets for terrorist acts.
Nevermeless, Lalonde did State that he is
going to Greece to do research this sum-
mer. Lalonde said he was concerned about
terrorism to some extent yet still believed
Greece to be a relatively sale country to
visit,

political science professor H. Wayne
Moyer said, “the perception oi the
Mediterranean is that it is not safe and un»
fortunately, perception is reality." Moyer
said that in his estimation the deciSion not
to go was responsible for it was impossible
to assure the saiety of the people in the
face of a real threat,

Political science protessor Robert Grey
said that, although the risk of a possible
terrorist attack is slight, the college decir
sion is prudent. “AS an individual, I am not
worried, yet one must act diiierently when
leading a group.”

What are the actual risks? Recently The
Des Moines Register ran an article by
Frank Greece which quoted state depart
ment terrorist data which stated that ter-
rorist killed 17 of 27.8 million Americans
who traveled abroad last year. That is one
fatality per 1.64 million travelers. in con-
trast, data from the National Center on
Health Statistics and the US. Census
Bureau show that one out or every 20,000
swimmers drown and one out of every 4300
Americans died in auto accidents in 1935.

Rawson:

Dibble to Become All-male Dorm

by John Harrison

Beginning next year, a Grinnel] institur
tion will end as Rawson Hall will no longer
be the allemale dorm on campus.

Starting next year. Rawson will be a co
ed dorm and Dibble Hall will become the
all~male dormi According to Bob Towner-
Larsen, Assistant Dean of Student Affairs,
the reason the all»male dorm is being move
ed from Rawson to Dibble is because fewer

upperclassmen wished to live in an all-‘

male dorm and thus many were forced to
live in Rawson because all the co-ed dorms

were filled.

Towner-Larsen said “the housing com-
mittee needed to find a smaller dorm for
the reduced male singlesex requests and
the smallest dorm on campus is Dibble,"

Almost all current Rawson residents
were apathetic about the change. When
one student was asked how he felt about
the end of Rawson’s status as Grinnell‘s
male bastion, he said, “No one feels very
attached to Rawson." Thus another Grin-
nell tradition passes.

Laue Endorses Peace Studies

by Jonathan Greising

Peace is now a viable and important
area of study. said a leading mediator and
peace theorist at last week's Scholar’s
Convocation.

"We've come upon an interesting and
exciting field, and it's a critical time to be
involved in that field," said James H.
Laue, board chair of the [1.5, Peace In
stitute Foundation.

Laue, who is also president of the Con-
llict Clinic, is a professor or sociology at
the University of Missouri at St. Louis. His
lecture was titled “The Subject is
Peacemaking: America’s Institute."

The National Peace Institute was
created by Congress in October 1984 as a
forum for research and training in conflict
resolution, Laue pointed to the Institute’s
establishment as evidence ot the credibilir
ty peace studies has gained in recent
years. -

“It is possible, and, indeed, academical-
ly respectable to study and teach
peacemaking," he said.

He offered his own experience as proof
of that assertion,

Last year, tor example, lowa Lieutenant
Governor Robert Anderson worked with
the Conflict Clinic in sponsoring a sym-
posmm on community dispute resolution
for the benefit of farmers, bankers and
community leaders During that symr
posium, Clinic mediators attempted to
defuse tensions springing from the farm
crisis.

Turning to international affairs, Laue

explained how much of the Peace In-
stitute's efforts are directed outside the
traditional circle of professional diplomam
and their methods.

“It is not true. as many people in the
schools or diplomacy and the State Depart
ment tell you,” he said. “that you can't
possibly understand or make any contribu-
tion to the resolution of international con
flict unless you‘ve worked at the level of in
ternational relations or international
diplomacy.”

Laue advocated a behavioral approach
as an alternative to more traditional
diplomacy, He said that approach draws
from various disciplines and creative ap-
proaches, and focuses upon third party
participation,

”What we’re talking about”, he said, “Is
the behavior that people and institutions
carry on as they attempt to resolve various
conﬂicts in a way that fits within various
constraints in the limits of law, Justice,
and ethics.”

Laue emphasized the value of whathe
referred to as “track two diplomacy," a
general approach moving opposing parties
away from formal bargaining conventions
and towards a broader understanding of
the cause of conflict. He cited some suc-
cess this approach has enjoyed in the
Mideast and in GreCOrTurkiSh conflicts.

He Said the first obstacle to peaceful
resolution of a conflict is the difficulty in
linding an appropriate forum ior discus-

sion. “A good part oi the trick is finding
just the right forum,” be said pointing out
the conspicuous lack of a universally ac-
ceptahle forum in the world. He cited the
United States' recent rejection of World
Court Jurisdiction.

Laue Said the United States is, at least
theoretically, in an ideal position to take
the lead in negotiation. ”We are, after all,
a nation of negotiators," he said. We have
a political structure made up of different
religious and ethnic groups, different in-
terest groups, and different immigrant
groups Rarely do any of us have the power
to get 100% of what we want all the time,”

However, he was critical of recent
United States ioreign policy decisions, pare
ticulariy in Central America and South
Africa

Referring to the Reagan
Administration's refusal to accept
Mexico’s offer to mediate in Nicaragua, he
said. “My contention is that we couldn't
imagine being negotiated upon by a nation
“weaker" than us, So we've missed a
number of possibilities for dealing with
these Situations

”The problem is how do you help
strengthen those countries and help make
them more democratic and more stable?
You try to Strengthen the center. to find
the appropriate convener who will bring
the two parties together to tigurc out how
it's in their best interest to do something
besides continuing to kill each outer off."
