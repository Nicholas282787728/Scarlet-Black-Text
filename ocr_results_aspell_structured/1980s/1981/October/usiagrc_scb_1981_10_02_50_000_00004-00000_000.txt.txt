- me $86 million

We wanl your Ideas

We're going to play a game; a numbers game Everybody try to follow
along but we’re warning you, it gets very confusing Please follow the game
all the way through to the end though, because there is a big prize when you
finish.

The game concerns the Grinnell College endowment and it goes something
like this:

The college now has an endowment that is somewhere around the incredible
figure of $86 million Now before we go any further stop and think about it,
eighty-six million dollars is one hell of a lot of money. It is so much money, in
fact, that it's almost hard to conceive 7 but for the sake of the game we will
implore you to stretch your imaginations,

The endowment is as high as it is because the trustees are doing an amazing
job managing the college’s investments The action that the trustees most
recently engineered, which in turn increased the endowment to its present
level, was the sale of a television station that the college owned in Dayton,
Ohio.

Now here’s where things get a bit confusing. The level at which the en-
dowment stood before the sale of the TV station was $50 million. As we
pointed out, the endowment now stands at about $86 million but simple math
doesn‘t prevail here. The obvious assumption would be that the sale price of
the station was around $36 million. but that's not the case. All we know for
sure is that the endowment was increased by $36 million because of a
multitude of business deals that were tied in with the sale. The college can't
release the actual sale price because that task is left up to the buyer, the
Hearst Corporation, and they aren't talking.

So let's recapr The long and short of the endowment game is that the
trustees have an extra $36 million to play with. They usually apply about six
percent of the interest generated from the endowment towards the college’s
operating costs. Now six percent of $50 million (the old figural is about $3
million, but six percent of $86 million (the new figure] is about $5 million. So
what it all boils down to is that the trustees have about $2 million more to
operate with. Did you get that?

Now all of that money doesn't immediately become available for general
use. The trustees usually funnel the money into either the plant fund,
something called the currentfundor directly into the endowment fund itself.

This is kind of a boring end to our game though. What good is a prize of $2
million if you can't decide what to do with it? But never fear, this is where you
get to play the game. We are asking you to write up an idea for how you would
spend the extra money and we'll print some of the best ideas in next week's
5&8. Be creative. and send your typed suggestions to us through the mail,

Hopefully you’ll come up with some great ideas, and, who knows, maybe the
trustees will read something they like.

How far do we take tradition

Thoughts on the James

Gang Bang

You've probably seen them in the P0,
or outside of Quadisheets of notebook
paper with “Ideas for James Gang Bang
Themes" written at the top, And you've
probably seen that along with the
predictable suggestions for a “Disco
Revival” or “Roaring Nenties" is the
repeated cry, “Change the Name! " Well, I
must confess to having written at least one
such request but I noticed many others as
well. After talking to various other people
about this allrcampus party, I came to
the conclusion that people, in general,
enjoyed the festivities but found the name,
James Gang Bang, to be very offensive.

0k ~ it rhymes, and it‘s tradition. Good
reasons to retain a name which connotes
gang rape? These were a few of the ﬂimsy
arguments I received in favor of the name
along with remarks such as, “It doesn’t
hurt anyone.” (meaning, of course, it
doesn't hurt me) We all like to honor
tradition and indeed we Should 7 when it
is appropriate. when “gang bang" is
replaced with “gang rape” it just doesn't
soundlike too much fun anymore. With the
occurence of one rape and one attack

Heathr Tingley

already reported this year, I believe it is
time to show some sensitivity towards
these women and all other potential rape
victims by abolishing the name,

We have two alternatives: we retain the
name in keeping with a questionnably
nostalgic tradition or we rid ourselves of a
joke that just isn't that runny. The good
times we share at the James Gang Bang
Should be die “tradition" we are con»
cerned about preserving, not the sill'
name which suggests violence an-
anything but fun.

Renaming the event can only serve to
enhance the occasion. I personally cannot
justify keeping such an offensive title for
such an enjoyable party, just to avoid
disappointing a few diehards. And
everytlme I see some refutation of my
argument on one of those sheets of
notebook paper: “We are not going to
change the name. Ills not offensive and it
does not hurt anybody, . , “ 1 just have to
hrush it off as an incredible display of
ignorance and insensitivity. n is offensive,
it does hurt people and I’ll Write it one
more time: Change the name!

A few words on words

Living in closed quarter

Contrary to popular belief, the serving
line exit door at Quad is NOT a good place
to engage in extensive social discourse,

I have a suggestion for the people run-
ning intramural (1M) sports. i think you
should hire professional referees it's
pretty unieeling of you to mke these games
so lightly that you hire students to ref.

You see, IM games are extremely im~
portant; the consequences of which are
far-reaching and significant. The outcome
of each battle has Vital impact on not only
the players but all students here, and in-
deed, all studenis everywhere for now and
generations to come,

What I suggest would cost a lot of money

and deprive a number of students the
opportunity to earn much needed cash. But
we need to start treating lM sports with all
the gravity they deserve.

But then again, if we treated IM sports
as they should be treated, I suppose we
wouldn’t need refs at all.

i don’t think there is anything wrong
with saving time or making something
easier. However (as always, there is a
however), 1 am slowly becoming tired of,
the‘jargon used to denote classes and’
mayors.
