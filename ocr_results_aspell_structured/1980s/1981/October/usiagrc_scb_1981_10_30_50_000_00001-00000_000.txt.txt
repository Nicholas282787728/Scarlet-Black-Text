Nickel coffee is still alive
Cunningham’s fountain:
Fortunately, some
things stay the same

by Richard Letchinger and Julie Shefsky
with Seth Meisel

When you iirst walk into Cunningham's
Drugstore in downtown Grinnell it doesn't
really seem all that special; it is just your
average drugstore. But when you get in'
side and start to explore the store you get
the sense that you've walked into a dif»
lerent time, a time of days gone by.

In the back corner sits what was once a
very common ieature or local drugstores.
a iull»service soda fountain and lunch
counter. But times Change, and with the
rise of fast food restaurants and the ins
creased expense oi running a small scale
lountain, this feature rapidly disappeared
from drugstores across America The fact
that Cunningham's still survives makes it
a unique hold—over lrom the past

The building in which Cunningham's
Drugstore is located once had three stories
and housed a restaurant along with a
drugstore. The restaurant, which also
made its own candy upstairs, was called
Candyland,

One menu ltem which made the
restaurant especially popular among col»
lege students and townspeople was the
Candyland sundae, This traditional sundae
made with Vanilla ice cream, mare
shmallow topping, chocolate syrup and
Covered with Spanish peanuts is still on the
soda fountain's menu today When Grin-
nell College alumni from the l550s return
to visit, they oiten stop in tor a Candyland
sundae, according to Jim Cunningham.
owner oi the drugstore

Jim's lather, Don Cunningham, bought
the building in 1938 when the previous
owners retired. He continued to run the
drugstore as it had been. and he rented out
the restaurant to Shell Ahrens

Then in 1954 a lire completely destroyed
the building. Don Cunningham replaced it
with a one-story, lireprool drugstore that
was built as one large store with a soda
fountaln where the restaurant had been At
that time there weren't many soda tonne
tains around, said Jim Cunningham. But
Candyland had a fountain, along with
several booths, which was already becom-
ing a gathering place in town so it couldn't
be eliminated, The Cunninghams~
therefore, revised Candyland and made it
into a soda fountain within the drugstore.

Jim Cunningham worked in his father‘s
drugstore throughout his school years,
then went to college to become a pharr
micist and graduated in 1960, For the past
10-12 years the lather and son have run the
business together. When Don Cunningham
died last December, his son officially took
over the business.

Cunningham mentioned that many col-
lege students still “hang out" at the soda
founLain. The drugstore, as well as most of
the businesses in town, note a signilicant
increase in business when the college is in
session. he added.

Cunningham's soda iountain is "kind oi
a gathering place" lor several dilierent
groups throughout each day, Cunningham
said. There are groups oi older men and
women in the mornings who socialize
while they enjoy their iivecent coilee
Lunchtime brings in many oliice workers

' from town. And the afternoon traffic is a

variety oi groups including “tons” oi col- .
lege students, according to Cunningham.
But since the high school moved out oi
downtown, high school students don't
come in too much, he said.

The owner also mentioned that the 18
stools at the icuntain, which are usually
full all day, keep three to four workers cone
stantly busy. hie takes in approximately
600 receipts every day but considering
many people pick up other people's
checks, a lot more than sou people are be
ing served daily. He seemed to be ‘very
proud oi the high ration oi workers to
customers, ”We're service oriented," he
said,

Yet the major problem oi maintaining a
soda fountain in Cunnlnham's Drugstore is
the great finanClai loss “We're running
the soda lountain at a delinite loss," said
Cunningham In-lgbo the owners lost ap-
proximately $6,000, stricuy comparing the
costs and benefits of running the fountain,

According to Cunningham. sewing l‘lvee
cent coffee does not affect the income
negatively He buys 18 pounds oicollee per
week so this bulk amount allows him to sell
it for only five cents without losing
anything. The ice cream and lunch ioods,
such as tuna and chicken. Cause most of
the loss,

Even though the Cunningham soda {ounr
tain is "not a money maker" directly, Cun-
ningham said that he "can't allord not to

have it " The uniqueness of a soda lountain

This is the infamous Cunningham’s
soda fountain and lunch counter. You
may not believe it but cottee only costs

rounds you. A shell holds part of a collec»
tion or pharmaci‘it's pestles and mortars
that belonged to Don Cunningham. In addi-
tion to that Collection there is also a (2011er
tion of old signs dealing with measle shots,
mumps, chickenpox and other health
related matters.

standing tall atop the shell is a glass
framed coca-cola advertisement, The
question or its authenticity was one oi the
topics being discussed when we visited,
The general concensus seemed to be that il
was, in tact, genuinely old and that it was
probably worth somewhere around $400.
The rest of the area is lilled with iowa
l-lawkeye pennants and a sign asking
customers to "Please Pay When Served."

When you sit down you will promptly be
given a glass of water by one of the many
women who work behind Cunningham's
counter. We visited in the morning so we
talked to the women on the a a.m. to 1 pm
shilt, Arlene Davenport and Velma reller-
man.

Davenport and Pellerman explained
that when they arrive in the morning
customers are already waiting to partake
ol the nlckleracup Butternut colice. "We
can‘t get the coiiee ready right away."
Davenport said. “And you can't imagine
all the commotion and hollering 7 good

“We make friends

but no money—

we’ll probably never change.”

brings customers into this drugstore in-
stead of the others in Grinnell and when
the people are in the store they lend to
walk around and do their shopping. An in-
crease in customers at the soda lountain
Could, in turn, increase business in the
other areas or the store by bringing people
in the store who may lill their prescripr
tions and buy their sundries at Cunn~
mgham‘s,

As important as the history or Cunn-
ingham's is, it is the atmosphere or the
store which makes it so unique When you
sit down at the counter one of the first

, things that you notice is the decor_that sur»

naturedly, oi Course! “

Davenport went on to explain that most
of the customers in the morning crowd are
“retlred people that come down for
visiting time" and that they usually "have
about the same crowd every day "

One special tradition this regular crowd
gets to enjoy every once in a while is free
collee when it happens to be somebody‘s
birthday. When the Coffee's not free the
fivercent price surely can't be too painful
ior the customers. As Davenport said, “We
make friends but no money 7 well pro-
bably never change

As for the food and drinks at the counter.

what can we say‘l it you haven‘t had the
pleasure ol eating at Cunningham's you're
missing a true event. Maybe everything
tastes so good because oi the surroundings
in which you're eating. We're not sure, but
one lact that's certain is the reason behind
such rich tasting drinks. instead or being
mixed by machine, the carbonated water
and ﬂavored syrups are mixed together by
hand when you order a softrdrink at Cunn-
ingham's You don't know how good
rootbecr can taste until you've had one at
Cunningham‘s,

0i course, the ice cream is what you can
really go crazy over at Cunningham‘s,
Real Meadow Gold ice cream (that's not
Quad or Cowles-brand ice milkt comes in
delicious ilavors and sits below great topp-
ings to form such iavorites as the Can
dyland sundae

Yet, there is one thing that equals the
quality oi the lood at Cunningham‘s, and
that's the people and the conversation The
talk and the people are genuine, and it’s
nice to get away irom strictly colleges ,
oriented liie every now and then,

The iollowing are some snippits o| con-
versation that we overheard or took part in
during our visit at Cunningham's:

”I'm missing all but one number tor a
$1,000 in m McNally's bingo game "

"You know what will probably happen is
that the person who gets that one number
that we need will probably walk right
out the door and throw their ticket on the
ground." .

Mr. on. Block told oi how he had a lire
at his barn many years ago when il was 35
below zero and how he put it out with
buckets oi water with the help oi Alma
"Tony" Gill. Gill IS one at the women on
the aiternoon shift at Cunningham's and
was enjoying a cup at colice beiore she
began her work day. Block went on to say
that he rents apartments in Grinnell to
many college students and that "the col-
lege kids never steal, always pay on time
and are some or the nicest people I rent to
l've loaned them money when they needed
u ..

A man commented that on a recent trip
to Latin America he traded "'one dollar ol
ourstAm ricantforiiii oooltheirs.Their
money ain't worth nothin’.“

"Kids nowadays spend money faster
than they make it,"

How' do you sum up Cunningham 53
Well, Davenport's comment about her job
could be applied to the atmosphere in
general “We know most everyone and we

‘ have a lot oi inn."
