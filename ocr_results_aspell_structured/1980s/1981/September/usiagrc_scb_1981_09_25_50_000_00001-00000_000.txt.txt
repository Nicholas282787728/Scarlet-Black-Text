Is another Great Awakening occurring?
Religious participation on the upswing

by Marilyn l. i_Clark and

Does religion play an important role in
the lives of Grinnell students today? Accorr
ding to our survey of campus religious
organizations and the student attendance
at six town churches, religion is making a
slow but steady return.

When Grinnell College was founded in
lets it had strong religious ties with the
Congregational Church. In fact, all the col—
lege presidents until President Main
(1906-31) were ministers. Over the years,
however, the college has stopped receiving
monetary funds lrom the Congregational
Church. Today, according to Dennis Haas,
Professor of Religious Studies and College
Cahplain, “The college only maintains
historical ties with the
Congregationalists.”

Has, a member of the United Church of
christCongregational, has been at Grin-
nell tor 16 years. He said that “in the early
1960’s, attendance at the Sunday chapel
worships in Herrick totaled almost 500 and
that a “)0 member choir accompanied the
service." By ﬁle late 1960’s attendance
dropped to its lowest level of 2030 students
each Sunday.

This year, however, attendance has in-
creased over last year’s average of approx-
imately 40 students each Sunday. Almost 75
people attended each of the first and second
chapel services this year. Haas Observed
that “this high figure is usually attained our
ly at the Easter service," Thus it appears
that more people are becoming involved
with chapel services than they have been in
the past lew years

The increase in religious participation on
campus is rcilected in the growth of cam-
pus religious groups, One 01‘ the more pro
minent groups on campus is he Associated
Jewish Students (A J.S ) This is a student-
run group which holds weekly meetings,
special Jewish holiday dinners and a
Jewish Cultural Weekend once a year. Ac-
cording to Harold Kasimow, associate pro
lessor of religious studies and faculty ad»
visor tor A.J.S., approximately one-third to
one-quarter or all campus students are of

r the Jewish faith. In the last three years
Kasimow said, “The group has become
more religious in its focus Although the
type of group varies each year, it now
tocuses more on prayer than singing and
storytelling.” Rachel Drucker, an active
member, said, “The type oi Jews that are
involved in A.J.S. are aware of their Jewish
identity and although they may not be
religious, want to have some association
with others."

Attendance at the group's last two Friday
night meetings averaged 25 people each
time. According to Rowena Rappaport,
“This year die two meetings have gone
well. Last year there was a feeling of ten-
sion in the group and no one went regularly,

, only on High Holidays." Finally, Aaron
Miller, when asked what he wanted to see
occur this year, responded, “I want a little
bit more organization and a more agr
gregate involvement or the Jewish students

According to Haas, another active group-—
on campus involves the Catholic students.
Upon hearing this, Walt stone, assistant
proiessor ol political science and advisor to
the Catholic student group, expressed sur-
prise because, he said, ”Only 1015 percent
or the Catholic commumty is involved in
the group." Nevertheless, this group is
planning community service activities the
volving st. Mary's Parish. in addition, the
group held a picnic last Sunday at Merrill
Park and approximately 2025 individuals
attended.

Another group which has many active
members is Christian Fellowship. This is a
transdenominational group, although the
majority or members are from traditional
ProtesLant churches. Approximately 50
people are actively involved. The
Fellowship otters large group meetings in
which 30-40 members attend talks by Out-
side speakers from other colleges and
seminaries, small group discussions for Bi
ole study and prayer meetings six days a
week at noon.

According to Kevin Lang, ”Most typical
members attend one to tour meetings a
week, although some attend eight or nine
meetings.” Lang further sated, “The focus
of the group is entirely religious, We Cone
centrate our meetings around prayer, Bible
reading and theological discussion.”
Although Scott Miller said that “large
group attendance has increased from 20-30
last year to almostto this year,” this is due,
in part, to the bad image the group believes
the campus holds about them. Lang said,
“Many people are afraid to come to our
meetings because they think we are a clos»
ed society.” Jim Bell, however, said that
“this lmage will change as the members
now involved become more comfortable
with the group,"

Three smaller religious organizations
have seen an increase in attendance this
year One group is the Quakers, This group
meets for silent meditation periods but is
not affiliated with a formal institutional
point or view, This year Bob Cadmus, assis
tant professor of physics, who coordinates
the group with his wile, said that “a
number or people this tall have expressed
interest in the group," In the luture Cad-
mus hopes that attendance increases and
that the group is able to include any in-
terested people trom town."

The Baha'i group on campus also has had
greater student interest. The Baha’i faith is
based in part upon the beliel that

B'aha u llah is the prophet lor today, that
there is complete equality between men
and women and that all religious faiths are
based from the same God. According to
organizer Cynthia chessick, “At the first
meeting seven individuals came but at the
second meeting we had 12 show up.”
Chessick added that “anyone can join the
group regardless of creed.”

Finally, the only group which has not ex
perienced an increase in attendance is the
Christian Science organization. Diane
Robertson, assistant protessor of biology,
who along with her husband and tour other
students, are the only active members said,
“Our number has remained relatively con-
stant over the years.”

The increase or student participation in
campus religious groups is mirrored in the
larger number of students attending the
services of six churches in town

After calling these churches we found out
that the Catholic Church has the greatest
attendance. Rev Harry Linnenbrlnk,
Pastor olSt, Mary‘s Church. estimates that

one students attend the two services held
there each Sunday. St. Paul’s Episcopal
Church has the second highest attendance
with approximately 20 students attending
service Last year, however, up to so
students came occasionally. This is an ins
crease over past years, First United
Presbyterian Church has the third highest
attendance with almost 20 people attending
services. other churches in town such as
St. John's Lutheran Church, First Baptist
Church and United Methodist church all
report attendance or between six to 12. As a
whole, the pastors of these churches in-
dicate that church attendance is on a slow,
but increasing trend,

The success of the Catholic, Episcopal
and Presbyterian churches in attracting
people could be due. in part. to their close
involvement with the campus. That is, Rev
Linnenbrink works closely with Stone, Rev.
Daniel 0gata oi the Episcopalian Church
sponsors many events which are Campus»
oriented and he has a daughter, Lynn, who
is a student, Also, the Episcopal pastor
receives hall or his salary from his diocese
to act as chaplain to the college communi»
ty.

Clearly, however, it is too early in the
semester to conclude that religious
awareness and attendance on campus has
deﬁnitely increased, Yet all the Campus
religious organizations that we surveyed
report a marked increase in student
awareness and participation in their ac~
tiVlties, Moreover, the six churches in town
that we contacted show an increase in
religious service attendance over that seen
in the last few years It remains to be seen
whether this trend toward religion corp
tlnues.
