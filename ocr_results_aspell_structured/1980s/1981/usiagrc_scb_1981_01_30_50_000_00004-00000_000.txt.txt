McConnell explains peanut butter crisis

by Jody Ann Hoffman .

“Peanut butter is as precious as
diamonds," according to Dave MCCunA
nell. director of Food of Grinnell
(FOG). Last year’s peanut crop was a
victim oi drought and consequently
peanut butter supplies are drastically
limited this year.

Grinnell cafeterias consume 1.500
pounds oi peanut butter each semester.
McConnell said that 350 pounds are
ordered three times a week and it it
becomes available peanut butter should
come in Feb, 6. Should the peanut but-
ter not arrive FOG will add a new pro-
tein source to the salad bar of similar
cost to the previously provided peanut
butter. However, McConnell said FOG
is yet undecided what that item will be.

The orange crop iailure in Florida
puts a strain on roe. The price oi
juices is going up 15 percent this week.
When asked if this would lead to a cut
back in juices, McConnell felt that this
semester no cutback in the availability
of juice could or should be made,

Lines for lunch resulted in long walls
and irayed nerves last semester. “Ser-
ving line problems are drastically
reduced this semester due to
cooperative efiorts from Catherine
Frazer, dean of the faculty, and the
iaculty by shiiting away irom the 11
am. class time." according to McConr

nell. This semester om students have 11‘

am. classes Monday, Wednesday and
Friday compared to 865 having 11 am.
classes last semester. This reduction of
23 percent should level out lunch lines.
Solutions to long dinner lines at
Cowles must wait for summer
modiﬁcations to take place FOG plans
. to set up new beverage lines in Cowles
. and Quad away from food lines in hopes
that traffic flow will improve. Plans to
set up a temporary line to supplement
the permanent line in Cowles (beginn-
ing of fall semester only) are being con-
sidered. When asked about a solution to
presently crowded dinner lines, McConr
nell said students on Norm Campus
should try to come to South Campus
- periodically.

Beginning Feb. 10 FOG will have
taste sessions ior new products. There
will be five sessions held on consecutive
Tuesdays. The Student Government
Association will select 28 students to
participate in each session. FOG wants
vegetarians to participate in hopes that
it can become more aware of present
vegetarian eating habits

McConnell also mentioned food waste
is again a problem [or FOG. McConnell
believed that ﬁle Grinnell students
"have slipped back since last fall's
campaign." In hopes oi cutting iood
waste and establishing non-wastelul
eating habits FOG will hold a waste

_ reduction campaign.

 

An unscheduled idea of McConnell‘s
is to hold discussion sessions on the
question: “What is the responsibility oi
iood service to the educational process
on campus?" McConnell pointed out
that the unlimited iood program allows
overeating which is a release ior
pressure and anxiety. “Should con»
straints be placed on students or should
we allow unlimited load to reduce anxs

 

Tm iNE

my? in this broad a program do we do
students a disservice? To what extent
do we carry me education?" These are
all questions McConnell ieels should be
discussed.

when asked it a limited iood program
would reduce FOG's costs. McConnell
replied, "I'm not convmced either a
limited or unlimited program is
economic. ‘

Health Center proposal update

by Kim McDonald

Ever wonder what happened to the
controversy last semester over whether
or not to move the College Health
Center to Grinnell General Hospital?
Despite recent silence about the pro»
posai, Grinnell College and the hospital
are still working on the plan, although
according to Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman, a more iirm decision
will not be reached until sometime this
spring,

Currently, lawyers representing the
college and the hospital are studying
the many legal issues the two institu~
lions would face in the event of a
merger at health services. The January
meeting and decision, which the 5&3

reported Vice President Waldo Walker
saying would occur. did not materialize
and one hospital administrator was un-
sure last week if the college was even
still interested. However, both parties
are still working on the proposal due to
the many problems oi increased liabili»
ty which the hospital might incur in pro»
viding the increased services. Tederr
man says once the legal question is
worked out they will meet again and at
that point he will probably again seek
out student opinion on the issue. He still
has last semester's student petition
against the move and hopes to poll
students it the proposal is proved to be a
viable one.
