Questions that demand answers Kevin Lang

The absence oi absolute truth is an
idea that is accepted axiomatically by
most educated people today. I can
understand why. There are certain
questions about our world whose
answers have implications for our lives
that we may not be willing to face. '

First, is mere an infinite and personal
God who created the world and is me
terested in man today? The most com-
mon answer in the academic communi»
ty is no. This leaves us with either a
deistic, atheistic or pantheistic world.
It is impormnt to follow the logical im-
plications of each of these possibilities
to their respective conclusions, which
are all some form oi nihilism. Some
people will dispute this point but in tact
not one of these three systems oi
thought can give a meaningful basis for
ethics, knowledge or man's inherent
worth. If we are merely specks of space
dust ﬂoating in the cosmos, men it does
not really matter ii wars occur and peo~
ple starve. It I wanted to assert my ex-
istence in such a meaningless universe,
I would succeed equally well by helping
an old lady across the street and by hit-
ting her with a baseball bat. The
Dadaists and punk rockers are to be
commended ior their integrity in
translating their nihilism into a way at
lile.

If there is a God who has com-
municated with man. then we have a
basis for knowledge and ethics and man
has inherent worth because God gave it
to him when he was created. Why don‘t
people care ior this option? Because it
is clear that we would have to heed the
message that God has given us, which
could impact most uniavorably upon
our ideas of what constitutes fun. In
short. diis is also a rather unattractive
option in answering our question. For-
tunately, you may interject at this
point, we can never know which alter—
native is actually correct.

In response to this proposition we will
pose a second question. Exactly who
was Jesus oi Nazareth? Could he have
been a great moral teacher or one oi a
number oi prophets who have address
ed mankind's spiritual problems with
great insighn No Madalyn Murray
O‘Hair could have been right when she
said, “He‘s a very despicable personali—
ty" but one must never suppose that
Jesus was just a nice guy. He came into
an absolutely monotheistic culture and
claimed to be God. He claimed that he
had created the world and would judge
it and that the only way to escape
destruction was through him. That
leaves only three possibilities for Jesus'

identity. He was either a liar, a lunatic
or what he claimed to be. There are no
other possibilities so we must choose
one oi the three. If we choose one of the
first' two. we are free to answer our
previous question as we like. The third
option clearly determines our answer to
the previous question.

We do not need to make our choice in
a Vacuum. Christians base their choice
oi the third option on Jesus’ resurrec—
tion, which is as well documented as
any historical event in ancient times.
Far from engaging in blind faith. Chris-
tians are willing to make their world
view contingent upon the veracity oi
this event. Paul wrote. “If Christ has
not been raised, our preaching is
useless and so is your faith.” On the
other hand, the realiaation that Jesus is
God demands action which can be very
costly.

The conclusion is this: there are ones
tions that you must answer for yourself
after exami ng all of the evidence that
you can obtain. Each possible answer
has implications that are difficult to ac-
cept but you must face them eventual-
ly. The planners oi Christian Theology
Weekend hope that the events that we
have scheduled will be helpiul to you in
your quest ior truth.

A lack of diversions at Grinnell Pam Goddard

"We want you to experience more iul-
ly the variety of the visions of the world
which human creativity has
fashioned.” Thus read my welcome to
Grinnell College in the tall of 1978. I was
an enthusiastic lreshman ready to “be
creative." We and one~half years later
I read the same lines and snort a sar-
donic ”HA.” Ron Kurtz said, "Ex-
perience variety, enjoy creativity," yet
I've watched creativity here wither
away into a caustic cynicism.

Lack of encouragement and lack oi
diversion are the problems. For the
past two weekends, I've watched the
paint peel all my walls and realized 7
there is nothing to do in this town. I hate
it because there is nothing to do.

Not giving it the old college try. you
think? There‘s plenty to do, you say”. l
agree if you spend your weekends at
second-rate movies or live from Friday
afternoon until Sunday morning in a
drunken stupor.

I've been involved. During my stay
here, I've run with the track team.
danced with Babe, skied with GORP
and sailed with Kathy McCluskey. I‘ve
worked at the Uncle Sam's Club and the
community elementary schools. And ii
I had a dollar lor every lecture,
workshop and movie I've attended, I'd

be on a plane to the Bahamas right now.

The basic problem is that Student
creativity is given practically nothing
lo work with and is rarely nutured
along. This is tragic because the poten-
tial here is overwhelming. The student
body is composed oi interesting,
talented men and women. Academics
are quite good and exciting, Yet the
nonracademic liie is so limited that
creativity is dying. These talented pco
ple [all into the same, old, dull routine
oi classes. Cowles and bar-hopping.

But I’m not writing this just to com-
plain. l'm here to propose some
changes. Ideally, the solution would be
to recruit an additional 2,000 to 3,000
students and build some new halls. I
mean wouldn't it be great not to
recognize every iace passing you on the
loggia? Wouldn’t it be exciting not to
know the gossip on everyone in this
school? And wouldn’t it be wonderful to
slip into anonymity irom time to time?
All the while, we could retain the better
aspecLs oi a smaller college.

My God, with more students. the town
might even expand! Imagine a theater
showing more than one movie per week
or a lounge big enough to dance in. A
real shopping mall. Baskin Robbins

even!

A larger town would enable students
to leave campus once in a whilei.You
could gain perspective on problems you
never can when living lace to face with
them on a daily basis.

But I’m realistic. I know George
Drake isn't reading this and starting
plans for additional dorms. So I'll
reduce my demands. How about a real
rock-and-roll band? Or a skip day
that’s more than a keg and a bottle ‘ol‘
bubbles in front of the Forum? And let's
just abolish that crazy rule regarding
charged admissions to campus events.
We could have real talent come to Grin»
nell and only those who wanted to at»
tend would pay.

I guess I’m really addressing the
lreshman and sophomore classes. I'm a
junior; it's too late to transfer and any
changes made probably wouldn't be ef—
iective until after I graduate. So I’ll just
sit here and write FUCK on my desk top
because so many exciting, creative peer
ple are rotting away in this schoolr And
it shouldn't be this way. Grinnell has
potential. It could really be the best
{our years at our lives instead of the test
of endurance it has become for so many
of us,
