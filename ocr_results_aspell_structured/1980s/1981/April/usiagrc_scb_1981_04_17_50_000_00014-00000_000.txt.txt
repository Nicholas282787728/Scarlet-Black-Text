;, Propaganda: Sade-masochism

~Sadism is "sexual excitement and
'satisiaction obtained by a person who
inflicts pain, maltreatment and
humiliation on a partner " and
masochism is “sexual satisfaction by
experiencing and tolerating pain wr~
merit and humiliation.” Fun huh Put
the two together and you have a rather
unpleasant phenomenon known as
SKrM. StirM is not a form oi sexual
liberation but rather a type oi sexual
exploitation. Over the past few years
- the media has attempted to “nor-
nialize" the concept ot soM. saying
‘ that it is yet another sexual pracn'ce
Isutlering under the prudishness and
hypocrisy of society. We see satM
‘ popularized in television commercials,
on records and in “art. " Am I an il»
~literate reactionary ’to claim that such
‘popularization is not only stupid but
:also dangerous?
Sada-masochism requires two people
; '_— one to dominate and one to submit.
The roles can be changed; what is im»
' portant is the idea or complete dominar

tion or submission. The punishment and
abuse is administered without emo
tional involvement on the part of either
participant. Since emotional involve-
ment is unnecessary, the partners need
not be in love or even attracted to each
other. They are using each other to
achieve a certain satisfaction. Freud
attempted to explain such behavior in
the toliowing ways. StrM could be a
residual form of the “death wish," it
could also be an attempt on the part of
each partner to express extreme
masculinity or feminity; tinally, it
could be a satisfaction of guilt or a need
to punish the ego. Essentially, sado-
masochism is a form of sexual deviance
and not sexual expression such as
heterosexualtiy and homosexuality.
Why am I upset? SAM is dehumanize
ing. One could call it the ultimate sex-
ual expression of industrialization.
S&M exploits its practitioners and does
not allow them to grow emotionally.
The people who need such satisfaction
can no longer feel; indeed, they are no

“In Defense of Liberalism

You won't believe what I heard Tuese
day night. Stuart Rothenberg, the New
Right speaker, called Grinnell a
throwback to the '60s “I haven't seen
so many freaks in years," he said after
.an hour and one-haltlof debate with
. students over the policies of the New
, Right. You can imagine how the five or

six of us who heard him say that
,r reacted, we were tickled pink. What a
~ compliment!

It seems like it’s been a long time
Since anyone commented on how liberal
Grinnell is, Now. I understand this
-‘.‘freak" remark is coming from a ”con-
servative with latent libertarian
tendencies" (he doesn't like the term
“archconservative”l but Still, doesn't it

, [eel good? Lately, all we ever hear
about is that Grinnell is going conser-
vative.

. , I can understand people mistaking
Grinnell for a conservative school when

. the S&B's proponent tor gun control is
our own campus version ot Dave

ystockman: Dave Molho. Then last-
week we read mat the answer to Grin-
nell s lack of creativity is a shopping
mall and a Baskin Robbins spawned by
a 100 to 200 percent' increase in the stu

., It was refreshing to see a portion oi

. the students get really involved in

‘vdefending their liberal values. Contrary
.to Professor Strauber's Mortar Board
remarks a few weeks ago, the students
showed, Tuesday night, that they could
argue at the level oi ideas. Even
Rothenberg had to admit, albeit grudg-
,ingly, that the students held their own
very well,

Unfortunately, the liberals on Cams
plus, and I think there are quite a few of

us, spent too little time detending our
beliefs. i‘m not talking about neo-
liberal beliefs of Pat Moynihan or Bill
Stowe; I mean my lellow bleeding
heart liberals who have let the power of
the last two decades slip out or our
hands. We must unite and show that we
are capable of defending our belief in
the treedom of choice in abortion deci-
sions, our support of the ERA as the
moral requirement ol a society which

longer human for to exploit a fellow
human being is to lower oneseli But,
you reply, these people are consenting
adults and they hurt no one but
themselves. This argument is
ridiculous, Just as constant exposure to
death via televiSlon reduces our
resistence to the idea of violent death as
wrong so the popularimtion of SAM
tends to make us believe that physical
humiliation and abuse of fellow human
beings for our own “pleasure" is accepr
table. We are. whether we like it or not,
human and 5&M reduces us to the level
of our machines and limits our poten-
tial. We are often afraid to take moral
stances because such stances may deny
someone else his freedom to do as he
wishes. I would suggest, however, that
we cannot avoxd all stances; we should
be willing to support human dignity.
sotM demeans the participants and
their society by implying that human
dignity resides in exploitation and
humiliation. Does our society need such
idiocy?

and the old, as well as for the rich and
powerful, If this last belief requires
redistribution of wealth, then I'm all for
it, V

I'm glad to see that there are students
who are willing to take the time to de-
lend these values. The rest of us should
be more willing to emulate these
students‘ willingness to put their beliefs
on the line in a debate Thanks to them
and students like them, past and future.

To the Editor:

On the issue of black separatism;
“Voluntary Political separatism"
"Black Self Segregation"
“Oppression lor Non-Coalescence"
“The problem of being black is real

but this is Grinnell! ! "
"Black Cluster:
Segregation"
Historically, political separatism has
meant the emigration of black people
back to African nations. Separatism at
Grinnell has taken on a new meaning it
seems. it apparently encompasses any
activity which involves a Substantial
number of black students (e.g. four or
five)
Because America is a Visual Society

of black and white, Many of the ac
