Cyclone Commotion

i feel a need to communicate a par—
ticularly problematical situation with
lasting ramifications to the entire earns
pus community.

The matter I am writing of is the
Cyclone. The Student Publications and
Radio Committee, on which I have
served, was confronted with the rather
unusual dealsion of whether the vear-
book the Grinnell Book should be con-
tinued in motto. For various reasons
yearbook sales had declined and there
were questions of whether a suitable
staff could be assembled to create a
quality publication. Our decision was to
continue the Grinnell Books The result
was a relatively poor quality 197930
yearbook (This is not only my opinion
but that of significant others that I have
spoken with on campus.) In fact. cam-
pus sentiment went something like
"With a yearbooklike that we might as
well not have one! "

Well, that's history, This year we
Grinnellians are blessed with a new en»
counter or the yearbook kind — a
revival of the Cyclone. a grand ole
publication with a colorful history. The
idea behind this revival is to create a
new image for the yearbook, casting
away the uniortunate impressions
created by the previous publications,
The new Cyclone promises to be big»
ger, better and more complete than in
previous years — a true representation
of the Grinnell student body: The
disparaging reality is a veritable “wolf
in sheep's clothing." From my ex»
periences, the Cyclone will be the same
unrepresentative, elitist and sub-
standard publication lt has always
been.

I came to this Conclusion after
several dealings with the personnel or
the new Cyclone, My first encounter
was on January an, the day that a notice
appeared in the Memo proclaiming that
all student groups or activities wishing
their photos in the book should call the
copy editor, Mike Alexander. [or an ap-
pointinent.

i, being one oi the two Grinnellians »

participating in the Management
Studies Program in Chicago during the
previous semester, decided that a photo
of us in our “business" clothing would
be appropriate. So atter confirming my
decision with the other participant, i
called Alexander and set up the photo
for a convenient time, several weeks
ahead.

The week before spring break.
another notice appeared in the Memo
urging student organizations to get
photos taken. Being active on the staff
of KDIC. I decided to check and see why
I had not been advised of when the
photo was to be taken. 1 found out that

April 24, [987

because of "scheduling difficulties” on
the part of KDIC personnel, only an ex-
ecutive board photo was taken. This
elitism pertuer me (after all. the
staff keeps KDIC going). So i gained
approval from KDIC top brass to have
an additional staff photo taken. Once

_ again i called Alexander and scheduled

_a photo session. I then proceeded to call, V.

‘every single DJ and'attempted to ad-
vise them of the photo date and time,
the next afternoon.

About an hour before the photo was to
be taken for Management Studies Pro-
gram and KDlC (by convenience and
coincidence they were to be shot the
same day), [received a call from Alex-
antler saying that due to space con-
siderations both photos would not be
taken or used. l proceeded to call
CycloneEditor Dan Flynn who said that
an additional reason for not taking the
Management Studies Program photo
was that the Cyclone could not possibly
photograph any bit-campus program.
even though it had been done in
previous years. When asked if any
other oil- -campus program had
responded to the Memo notices, Flynn
responded that there were no others to
his knov'vledge. At this point, I had no
choice but to accept his decision.

I have thought about the situation a
lot since then and I think the entire mat
ter shows typical lack of efficiency and
responsibility on the part at the Cyclone
staff. Even it as many as 12 off-campus
organizations wanted their photos

Cyclone space. Certainly otrcampus
programs like Grinnell~ln>L0nd0n
deserve yearbook recognition.

I have communicated my annoyance
to several people involved in SGA and
media on campus. The overwhelming
sentiment seems to be in favor at my
position.

Until I pushed the matter when I saw
Flynn in the post office Tuesday, I had
heard nothing since my last conversar
tion when Flynn vowed to check into the
lane matter and let me know exactly
the status of the staff photo This action
tor lack oi action, as the case may be)
leads me to ponder whether the Cyclone
staff is incompetent or just plain lazy.

I guess the students of Grinnell Col-
lege will just have to suiier along tor
another year with an elitist,
unrepresentative and probably subs
standard publication, as in recent
years That is, unless students exert
their power in the marketplace and
refuse to purchase such a publication.
Being a graduating senior, I did pur-
chase a Copy of this year's Cyclone 7 at
the KDIC auction where I am sure the
profit will be used to better a worr
thwhile organization.

A parting thought 7 it the staff can-
not reproduce a yearbook that is entire
1y representative of the Grinnell stur
dent body both here and on oiicampiis
programs, maybe we should drop the
publication entirely.

“for the college and for the students. Due

to the personal nature of the work they
perform with students. many on cam-‘
pus have no idea how invaluable are the

over the years they have been here, I
canthink of actual lives being saved
and college careers being salvaged.

i I personally wish to thank this staff

their dedication to the students. This is
the final group of people I have had the
opportunity to work with in my years at
Grinnell and I will greatly miss them:
