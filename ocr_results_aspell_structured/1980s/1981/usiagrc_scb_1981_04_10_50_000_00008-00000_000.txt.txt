Julian Bond spake last Saturday evening
in Herrick Chapel to highlight this year's
Black Martyrs' Weekend Bond gained M-
ti'onat prominence in 1966 when he was ex
pelted from the Georgia State Legislature
after expressing his views against the Weir
Mm War. He was returned to his seat later
by a decision of the United States Supreme
court. In 1968 Bond was the ﬁrst black to
be nominated by a Democmtic convention
for the ui'ce-presl'dency; an honor he declined
beeaaae he was revert years too young, accor-
ding to federal law. corrently a Georgia
atete senator: Bond detiaers approximately
laa speeches per year on college campuses
around the country.

Band spoke on “The Political Status of
Black Americans in the '80s” to Li large, ate
term've audience. A witty and poetic
speaker, Bond discussed some of the history
of the civil rights movement "I the United
States, the gains btoch Americans have
achieved in recent years and the distance
they still have to travel

After his speech a wellrotterided reception
was held in Bond's honor at the Black
Cultural Center As the long evening drew
to a close, Band was still able to nmiably
answer our questions, Talking oath the 5&3
[or 50 minutes, Bond covered a widc mnge
of topics including his experience as hast of
NBC’s "Saturday Night Live,” He conic
merited on how much he enjoyed doing the
show but lamented about the low salaries of
the performers, which was eoiaeneed by the
one cigarette they passed around.

list oi actions that black Americans
needed to lake to achieve racial equali-
ty: “Those are the things that we as
black men must try to do:

To pras the matter of stopping curtail-
ment oi our political rights,

To urge Negroes to vote intelligently
and effectively.

To push the matter oi civil rights.

To organize business cooperation.

To build school houses and increase in-
terat in education.

To open up new avenues or employment
and strengthen our hold on the old.

To distribute tracts and information in
regard to the laws of health.

To bring Negroes and labor unions into
mutual undeisianding.

To study Negro history.

To increase the circulation Dl honest . .
newspapers and periodicals.

To attack crime among us by all civiliz-
odagencies. . , ."

Reviewing these commands in his
talk Saturday, Bond said Lhey should
Still be the actions of the black move,
ment today. Nevertheless, he ieels
black Americans have made signiiicant
progress toward racial equality.

Important in their progress has been
a continuing change in the type of
leadership in the movement. Bond ex-
plained mat in the early '605 lawyers
were the primary means oi lnstigaling
civil rights legislation. However, Mar-
tin Luther King changed all this by his
insistence on mass participation. Bond
explained, “What King did was say ii
you want to light against segregated

buses, walk. Everybody can walk.
What the students in the 19605 Said was
it you want to light against segregated
lunch counters, sit in, picket, march.
Anybody can do that. the best educated
person and the poorest educated per»
son."

King‘s activities inspired blacks
throughout the nation to begin local
civil rights campaigns. These grass
rools leaders, while not known outside
of their immediate area, had created a
strong civil rights network that was
able to persevere alter King's death.
Bond said that now, however, “die
tragedy is that we are slowly slipping
back to the point where we think that
only professional Civil rights workers
can work at civil rigth and that's a bad
mistake."

History shows us that. there are
several ways to initiate change {or the
black community and one way is to
work against the government. as did
Eldridge Cleaver and the Black Pan-
thers. Bond, however, said that he felt
working within the government system
was the only way to change legal ine-
qualities. He explained, ”Almost the
only way you can change systems is
from the inside." As he stated in his
speech and stressed again during our
interview, political participation is of
paramount importance to the black
movement, According [0 Bond, the two
crucial areas [or black aciion today are
increased black voter turnout and
greater political sophistication. As an
example of the need for this type oi
