Fisher, Breuer serve NIACC a loss

by Rick Richardson

Co-Captain Gretchen Fisher and fresh
man Sylke Breuer led Coach Martha
Rowcddcr's Volleyball team to its first
victory of the season last Saturday in the
PEC The Pioneers swept Northern Iowa
Area Community College by scores of 1575.
15-13. and 156 after losing to Ellsworth
earlier in the day.

in the ﬁrst match, the Pioneers crushed
Ellsworth in the first and tourth games, 15
7 and l573, but were edged out by Close
scores of l5rl2, l5410. and 15-13 in the other
games to lose the decision

Alterwards, a disappointed Coach
Rowedder remarked that the team
“wasn't aggressive enough We didn't play
as well as we have been playing We could
have won. but we‘ve got another one
coming up, and wc can play much better."

And play much better they did. Alter an
hour break, the Pioneers took the court
against NlACC and simply demolished
them

The first game belonged to Gretchen
Fisher. She began the game by serving a
screamer between two hapless NlACC
defenders, thcn shot a serve that bounded
off NIACC hands into oblivion, and so on,
and so on. :ind so (lll.

When the dust had Cleared. the Pioneers
had a 12-0 lead. NlACC Could only return

Once Around The Field

Both of the goals were notched by
halfbaeks as the Pioneers opened Midwest
Conference Southern Division action with
a 2-1 victory at Monmouth last weekend.
“We were lucky to win against a Vastly
improved and spirited Monmouth team
playing before a'big Homecoming Crowd."
Pioneer coach John Ptitsch said. Reid
Wilson notched Grinnell’s winning goal
with 1:14 leit in the game. The other
Pioneer tally was scored by Charles
Maxon in the tirst halt. The victory upped
Grinnell's record to three wins, two losses,
and one tie.
