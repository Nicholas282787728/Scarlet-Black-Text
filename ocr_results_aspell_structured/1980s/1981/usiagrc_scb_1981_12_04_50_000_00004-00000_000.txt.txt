comnuier scandal Vllll

continue lllllll
IIIIBSIIIIIIS are answered

As the great Grinnell computer scandal enters its third week, rumors
concerning the firings of Mark Grundler and Dave Renaud continue to

fly and an increasing number of people are becoming involved, both on -

campus and off. Also, apprehension is growing in die community over
the power of college administrators, personal privacy and the future of
Computer Services.

Although Executive ViceaPresident Waldo Walker has cited
membership in the Tom Moberg Fan Club as one reason for the
dismissals, the severity of the mens’ punishment and the reaction to it
by those close to the situation indicate that much more .was going on
between the Computer Services staff and the administration than has
been revealed. These “goings on” should be disclosed to the communiv
ty — and then the rumors and apprehension-might stop.

Anonymous sources have told the 5&3 that personal feuding at Com»
puter Services may have caused the terminations of Renaud and
Grundler. Certainly, the creation of a Tom Moberg Fan Club indicates
that animosity existed. Yet a letter received by the $813 from user con»
sultants shows that the club existed earlier under other names. (See
next page.) How can the administration expect the intelligent people of
whom it claims to be so proud to believe that such a minor issue could
cause the firings, reactions and paranoia that it has?

It is easy to get angry at the administration for dismissing men of
such competence as Renaud and Grundler if you worked with them.
However, the majority of the campus community did not know them
before the controversy began. So, besides feeling empathy for those in-
volved in the situation and aggravation at the incomplete reasoning
given by Walker, this majority can also feel threatened that any per»
son‘s computer file could now be monitored by Computer Services
staff.

It is true that the violation of computer mail file privacy is a sticky
legal situation because it has few, if any, precedents. But if Walker can
say about the computer system, “This is a college and the computer is
ours and the people who work'on the computer are employed by us and
we draw the regulations," (8&3, Nov. 27, 1981), couldn‘t he also invoke
this argument if exchanges through the campus mail were suspect? 0r
correspondence from “the outside world,” since it does reach students
and faculty through the collegeowned post office'.7 It’s only 1981 7 is
Big Brother already watching us?

Besides questioning the administration’s judgment in firing the two
men, the relations among Computer Services staff or the right of
privacy on this Campus, we must all question the future of Computer
Services. Without two ‘of its most able administrators and program-
mers, how will it survive? And how will this effect all members of the
campus community? These are just some of the questions the ad
ministration must still answer.

To the Editor:

Recent events at Computer SerVices
have led us to believe that the informal
group known as the .“Tom Moberg Fan
Club" [TMF‘CJ has been viewed in a total-
ly unintended manner. For over a year
now, a group oi students and staff
members has been associating as friends,
In order to furthera sense of unity we have
banded together under various titles, in
cluding ”Space Rangers" and ‘iTrekklesJ'
As part or our social activities we exchang-
ed computer mail with each other and
went on bakery runs. Recently, someone
suggested calling ourselves the “Tom
Moberg Fan Club,” not intending to smear
or spite anyone but merely to create
another humorous name

Waldo Walker has stated to some
members of the TMFC that the group con-
stituted “intimidation and harassment ola
stair member" and that such a group is in
violation oi college policy. The only public
action which could be viewed in such a
light was some writing on the Carnegie ter»
minal room's blackboards. writings which
were meant entirely in fun. One oi the two
messages was “Moberg for Dean;" the
other was intended to reier to any heavy
computer user and nol to Mr. Moberg in
particular.

Because of circumstances beyond our
control, some of our personal computer
messages to each other may have offended
Mr, Moberg. We are sorry that this might
have-happened; we had no reason to
believe that these mail messages would be
read by anyone other than the person to
whom they were addressed.

As students and stall members of Grin-
nell College, we find it unfortunate that our
iniormal group was used as a reason ior
iinng two highly competent employees oi
the college. We did not intend that the

Student burnout

li you've been around me ior more than
10 minutes, you know that i grew up in
South Dakota and Wyoming, The reason I
bring that up is that growing up there, i
was exposed to quite a hit oi American In;
dian culture. hundreds of times, i heard
this piece oi Indian wisdom: "Never judge

a man until you walk a mile in his mocr

casins."

The world, however, is not made up of
wise American Indians. It is, of course,
tilled with people who hate other people
and who mistrust and are mistrusted by
other people.

Unfortunately, Grinnell is a part of that
world. A good example is lastyear's “jock
issue." The campus was divided into two
camps, me jocks and the Anti-jocks, each
hating each other. Neither reaching out to
the other to try to understand.

It becomes a situation where I think of
only how others should be thinking of and
treating me. 0i how the other guy should
"walk a mile in my moccasins " 01‘ never
giving thought to how maybe my hatred
for the other guy is indeed unlounded and
unhealthy, just like it is when someone else
hates me.

By the way, if this section oi my column
seems to be naive and uniniormed, I'm
sorry.

Aiter about two and onehali years oi
college, I've learned at least two things.
Almost always, when someone asks for my
opinion, it is because he wants to give me
his and almost no one changes his opinion,»

Based on my limited experience as a
reporter {or the paper last year, the ad
ministration and iaculty in the above

To the Editor:

I am a senior and have been reading The
Scarlet and Black ior over three years. I
find this year's 8&8 somewhat superior to
its predlcessors. This year the paper is
much more coherent and better planned.
There is actually evidence that the thing is
edited! Yet, this is the extent of my praise

I have iound the icons oi your paper to be
very narrow, namely Grinnell and Grins
nell College. This is fine to a certain ex
tent, that is, in regard to the news, sports,
entertainment, etc. sections of your paper.
There is, however, a limit to all things and,
1 think, you have changed editorial policy
into a credo. As I said, within cermin
parameters your policy is ﬁne but you
even apply it to the “opinion page." This is
annoying. Never can we read any opinion
about anything that is outside of the world
of Grinnell.

You have published articles on how the
students seem to becoming more political
ly active and letters urging greater
political activity and, yet, in the midst or
all this the college newspaper remains

'Aco'

We now have lhc center curriculum
question oclore us I‘m wondering, is there
anything we, the students, could possibly
say, any question we could posstbly ask,
that could change the administration‘s opi~
nion'?

i doubt it. That's why I’ve decided it
would be a waste of time and 5&3 space to
even try.

Well, here goes my waste oi time and
space.

At the beginning or the year, you
students were complaining about the over-
crowded conditions in the dorms I guess
you just can't be satisiied. iiere the ad-
ministration comes up with a solution and
you‘re still complaining, '

When a core — excuse me, center — cur-
riculum IS instituted, and students are
transierring out leit and right and high
school students are passing Grinnell by
leit and right, then there will be plenty oi
room m the dorms.

At the forum on NOV 23, President
Drake Said that about 80 percent 0‘ the
students graduating from Gnnnell obtain
a liberal arts education. That's where that
figure comes from when i use it.
