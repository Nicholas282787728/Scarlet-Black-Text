llitically inert. Doubtless you mistake
is inactivity with neutrality. While it is
ue that the news must be reported as
bjectively" as possible it is also true
at a politically neutral op/ed page is
eless. Yet your op/ed page is (for the
ost part) neutral, The outstanding col-
ns you have run so far have been on
hat to do with $2 million, the viability of
‘ thro-” as an abbreviation and other
.cous considerations. Do you realize mat
-u've run at least six items on the name
’an all-campus party? Given the size at
ur paper you have devoted a signiticant
mber of column inches to insigniiicant
bjecls.
This is irresponsible. There are no ex-
ses. As the campus newspaper you have
responsibility. You must not only report
is news, as you say, but also raise issues
levant to Grinnell students. Further-
ore these issues must be relevant to the
udents above and beyond their existence
s students at‘Grinnell College. The camr
us paper should heighten our awareness;
’should warn us that most of the basic
elieIs oi Grinnellians are being threaten~
d, These beliefs include l'ree speech,
-ace, separation oi church and state,
- ial justice, etc. Some say that the situa-
on is not nearly so bad. Perhaps..ln any
ase the 8&5 should address this question
ot ignore it Aitcr all, Grlnnell is only a
mporary stage in our lives and sooner or
ter we must face what is happening in
his nation 7 and we must face it outside of
he womb of Grimell College,
Finally, 1 wish to make clear exactly
horn i am criticizing in this letter. I feel
hat the uniiorm political inactivity or your
aper could only be achieved-through one
eans, i.e,. editing, It is much more likely
hat the editor does not print political ar-
lcles than the writers refuse to write
hem. Even if I am wrong it is nevertheless
rue that no matter how unfair it seems,
he editor is the one who must ultimately
ake responsiblity ior “his" publication. —
opeluuy, Rick Autry

I am remale, thanks.

ean my goat doesn't give milk?
- M: Well, no.

YL: Should I get a new goat?
ADM: No, because you can probably find
nut why it doesn't give on the other two
.ays and correct the problem.

YL: Then why discard the old system en-
irely ii it iails only a small percentage of
he time?
~TUDENOUS. Right on! The problem is
. at with the system, it's the people in the
ystem, the advisers.

ACULNOUS: Wait a minute, the students

on‘t take their adviser‘s advice and
there‘s nothing we can do.
STU: Hey. you sign the cards,
HYL: Is that entirely i'air. Studenous?
Alter all. it the adviser doesn't sign, the
todent doesn't get into any class, and one
can't let that happen, now can one?
FAC: There you go, it's the students‘ fault.
HYL: I'm sure you don't mean that,
Faculnous. After all, we're talking about
only 20 percent oi the students, But surely
we can all agree on this: it there is a great
roblem and the System is in a shambles,
it should be changed. But it the system is
successful, as it is in this case so percent of
he time, then maybe.the system can be
improved rather than ch‘ah‘ged.

 

Bill WIIIII about
the Illl'llltlll'ﬂ?

To the Editor:

In the long discussion of the incident at
1205 Park, one aspect of the situation
seems to be ignored, The focus of the
original article was possible damage done
to antique furniture, Thls is iallacious if we
consider the treatment of this furniture
prior to its removal irom Loose basement.
Here the items were stored in a damp,
musty area tor some period (presumably
years?), Over break a student committee
removed oil paintings irom similar
storage where they had been allowed to
collect mold and rot, There are reports
that items such as a baby grand piano and
more antique rurniturc are presently tall-
ing into the same disrepair

While we recognize the legitimate cone
c'ern in regards to breaking and entering,
equal concern for the well»being of anti-
ques has not proven to be a priority or the
administration — sincerely, Stephany
Sanborn and Jim Swenson

Br etly, Operations Research LORl is a
discipline that is concerned with solving
problems. One or its philosophies is that ii
a system is not working optimally, rather
than change the system, the components oi
the system can be changed, improved,
replaced or otherwise rearranged to make
the system work at its best. i might add
that OR is a relatively new ﬁeld. being
around only since World War it,

Well, we have a major problem. The col-
lege isn‘t living up to its catalog and a
measly to percent or the graduating
students are getting a liberal education

i think this problem can be likened to one
oi the iirst problems attacked through the
methods of OR. The British were susmin-
ing heavy damage irom German bombers
in WW ii. But rather than invent new
weapons or add planes to the Air Force,
the British iollowed the advice oi the 0R
scientists and placed radar equipment in
“optimal” locations and otherwise chang-
ed, improved, replaccd and rearranged
the components or the air deiense system.
This reduced the eil'ectiveness oi the
bombers dramatically.

1 hope the administration and iaculty
can look at the problem facing us now us
ing post-ww ii thinking.

‘The famous philosopher, Berkeley,
wrote a piece once called ”Three
Dialogues Between Hylas and Philanous."
1 hope that helps to explain where the in-
spiration lor this piece comes irom. i knew
that philosophy class I took my ireshman
year would come in handy, one day.
