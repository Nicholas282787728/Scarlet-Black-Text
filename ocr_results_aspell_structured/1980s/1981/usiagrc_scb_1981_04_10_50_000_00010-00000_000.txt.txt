Kennedy said the iun will begin at 4

The ”new" Grinnell Relays Weekend
scheduled {or April 24 and 25, promises
to “go down in history alongside the
election of Millard Fillmore" and
should promote an atmosphere
reminiscent of the official skip days of
yore, according to Co-chairman oi the
Relays Committee Wes Kennedy.

The weekend incorporates some ol
the functions of a skip day and it is this
expansion that Kennedy hoped will
foster a community spirit in which
Grinnellians will “poke lun at things we
emphasize the rest of the year." He also
said that he wants students to realize
“there are things in life more important
than competition and success."

While the relays weekend will offer
new eventssuch as a pie eating contest
and the return at beer chugging, in
which dorms and houses will each
select a participant. the traditionally
popular events such as the Milwaukee
Beverage Relays and the Babe Ruth
Bat Race will be retained, Back after

Quote of the week...

Grinnell students, widely known lor
their intellect, creativity and liberal
imagination (not necessarily in that
orderi have been known to express
their opinions on many issues. We
wanted to get a more complete feel for
the true nature of the Grinnell student
so we asked this question: it you could
be any musical instrument you wanted,
what would you be and why?

Here are some of their thought-
provoking answers:

An anonymous student adviser stated
that he would like to be an oboe. “It gets
these sounds, you can really get these
depressing sounds out of it and tl kills

people."

Wes Kennedy said, --A piano. It can
do lots or things, You can play almost
anything you want on it in almost any
way you want to."

Said Eric Hamaker, an individualist,
"I would not want to be a musical ins
strument. They have no thoughts to ex
press. They can only be played,"

John Mandel, a true romantic, said
"A trumpet — it makes such sweet
muSlc."

Pete Zwetkoi, alter stating that he
wanted to be a “huge piano" expressed
the most stimulating explanation for
his answer, “Who knows?"
