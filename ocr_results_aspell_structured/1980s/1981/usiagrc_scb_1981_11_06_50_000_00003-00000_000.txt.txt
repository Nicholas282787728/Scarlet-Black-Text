Students complain of decline in food quality
“You can always make a peanut butter sandwich” says McConnell

by Laura McDermith and Eric Weiss

”Our food service is very good,” said
Dave McConnell, food service director of
Grinnell College. “I've never seen such a
great variety oi entrees, as much iresh
lruit and such an immediate response to
food complaints.” Such service costs Grins
nell students on the full board plan $1,095
{or one year. Because Grinnell has its own
iood service it can be ilexible, according to
McConnell. It can reflect the students'
desires and can make the necessary
changes when dishes prove unsatisractory.
Although most students are generally
satisiied with the service, many feel that

.thegqualityand variety oi the iood have
decreased since last siﬂldol year, ,

. One student commented. “The food has
gone downhill and there is no imagination
in the meals. The entrees are all meat and
potatoes. ,. . boring, boring, boring." He
further commented on the lack of selection
ior‘ﬂe’ritreos ,and the poor planning ‘that
leads to a selection running out before the

'end oi a meal, ,

“I‘ve seen'schools that provide mainly
hamburgers, hot dogs and fries I'm not
sure if that's healthy. We‘re committed to
sound nutrition . r t We currently offer a

more healthy diet than in the past,” said
McConnell. But some students have notic-
ed an increase in the number of plain meat
and starch dishes. “Grease. grease,
grease." was one student's response to the
iood this year,

McConnell noted that Studenu love to
complain. The dining hall is a good place to
let on steam Maybe you’ve had a hard
day with a professor, in class or writing a
paper. It may ieel good to say ‘it sucks' but
have they come back to the kitchen and
told me what's wrong?" asked McConnell,
He also pointed out that all new selections
were tastertested and approved by

students prior to becoming part oi the'

menu.
~ Although McConnell sees increases in
vegetarian dishes in the future, he
perceives no serious deficiency now and
said he has received ”a good response"
from vegetarians. Eric Seaburg noted,
however, that “veggie meals have become
bland," Seaberg also expressed en»
thusiasm for the salad bar, to which he can
turn if no entrees appeal to him.
McConnell said. “I have yet to see a food
service with Such an extensive salad bar,"

“Please sir, can I have some more?”

Most students agree with Seaberg and Mc»
Connell that the salad bar offers variety
and a nice alternative or supplement to the

The administration's decision to revise

Frazer said, and she does not interpret the
two policy revisions as a return to tradi-

Proposals to give more structure to the
college curriculum are still in rudimen-
tary stages but any update is likely to bea
more imaginative iramework than the
commonplace “distribution" option
recently made a part of many college and
university curriculums. Frazer said a less
open-ended structure would not be a cen-
tral student concern.

“We're beginning to talk about what
womd be the benefits of more structure in
the curriculum, it's possible, even pro-
bable, that we will implement more struc-
ture soon," she said “Harvard, which is
kind oi a paccsetter in education, recently
returned to a core curriculum. Right now,
only one percent of all educational institu-
tions have open curriculums and only five
percent oi liberal arts collegﬁ do — we are
in the ﬁve percent at the moment.
