A streamlined and more efficient SGA planned
Rowe and Gould talk about their goals

As another new school year begins, so does the
work 0/ the new Student Government Assam:
tum ofﬁcers. We asked SGA President Doug
Rowe, and Vtceersldent Teri Gould to sitdoum
and discuss thetr phyla /or this year's SGA.

Rowe and GouM were both enthmlhsttc and
expressed excitement over implementation of
their ideas. The following is an edited lmnscrlpt
of their conversattml, They were interviewed by
Loam Carter and Richard Lernhmger o/ the
5515 staff

5&3: Where should we start"

Gould: There are a lot of specifics we
could talk about that we're putting together
to streamline the allocation of money and
to better coordinate the social calendar; to
eliminate a lot oi bureaucracy.

Rowe: Last year Bob Kl 'ne wrote up a
special report on all the individual commit:
tees and based on that and also on just
basic rcierences irom omer years, we
found that several of the committees were
not ever meeting all year, maybe meeting
once to decide what kind of beer they‘d
have at their party here. so they really
weren't doing much. We've created the Stu-
dent Rules Committee this year.

son: Can you explain what the SM is
and does'.7

Gould: It's an umbrella committee and
this is the iirst year it goes into practice.
It's a total of all the committees that didn't
really have a lunction every year: Food
Service, the PEG. etc. Maybe every live
years an issue will come up that they'll
have to deal with. Otherwise, we're taking
our time to choose the committee; they're
meeting and having nothing to talk about,
SRC also has the capability to put together
or disband any committee, Also any
disputes that come up, such as interpreta»
tions of the constitution over who can run
{or Vicerpresident; whether they're
qualified. Things that would have gone to
the Judicial Council in the past. the SRC
can now handle. It's basically a catchrall
committee.

5&8: Does Judicial Council still exist?

Rowe: Yes, that's being iormed right
now.

sob: Who appoints the people on this
new SRC committee?

Gould: The cabinet chose a chairman,
who is Mark Salmanson. and he will choose
his committee.

Rowe: For instance, the initiative Fund
Committee has not been totally put
together and a couple other committees are
still being put together because oi the pro-
blem of how late in the year the election
was last year. The Student Rules Commlt~
tee is overseeing those right now. But those
hopefully will be chosen by this iollowing
weekend.

8&3: Why are committees still being
formed right now?

Rowe: The reason is that last year,
because at the president's election being
held weels later than it was supposed to
have been held, as far as we usually get
done, instead or bciore spring break, in the
end, there was so little time to get any com:
mittees formed. We were able to pick the
cabinet and do some things like that but as
tar as the overall selecting ol Judictal
Council and Initiative Fund Committee and
so on. we were unable to get all that done,
And we were also hoping to get some
freshmen involved by waiting until now and

Doug Rowe

giving them a chance to become a part oi
the committees and so on.

5&3: How do you get people involved in
committees?

Rowe: A lot or the responsibility lies with
the hall presidents. I've tried to talk to peer
ple in the dorms and so on and that‘s a link
that we can't really have much control
over. We can tell them, ”Please, do this"
but whether they do it or not .

Gould: We’re making an effort to inform
hall presidents more exactly oi the pro-
cedure. We're writing up specilic
guidelines for IFC and the Finance Com:
mittee so they really know how the system
works and it doesn't take them a year to
ﬁgure out. Hopeiully, that iniormation will
be disseminated a lot lasterl

5&8: Do you have any suggestions for
hall presidents to reach the people in their
halls?

Rowe: Almost all hall presidents, all the
time I've been here. have suggested or
been advised to post the minutes and ac»
tivities, write up what was happening. how
they voted.

Gould: And they also know what issues
are coming up to be voted on and they can
call hall meetings any time they want.

5&8: So there are two things you have
said that you're doing this year: you want
to streamline the money allocation and you
want to change the social calendar or
restructure it Are these your main goals
tor the year?

Gould: Not really change the social
calendar but get better cooperation bet-
ween all the special interest groups and our
social planning because there were too
many conﬂicts last year.

Rowe: The whole thing is that we're try-
ing to get it into more synchronized .

Gould: Yes, we're trying to get more
cooperation and coordination. The social
coordinator, Allison Paich, is having a big
meeting of all the heads of the special in-
terest groups so they can coordinate their
Calendars together, And then they're also
meeting with Laura Bradley. who's the
films chairman, to coordinate their lllms
together, We just hope for better coopera-

‘tion.‘ ’ ’

Ten Could

Rowe: For instance, some events we
don't have any control over

55:13: Such as?

Rowe: Doing their own funding; there's
not much we can control, As far as SGA
lunds, we're going to try to control them to
having one weekend a year. instead of hav»
ing several, What we're doing is — there
are only a limited number or weekends dur:
ing the year and they're being jammed up
and the whole calendar is lllled; almost this
whole fall is even filled without having too
many or those cultural things start. it puts
a real damper on the ability for spontaneity
when new groups come, for instance. when
Georgia Dentel says, "Hey, we can get this
group" but we can't do it because of the
weekend or so on as well as the {act that the
turnout [or those have not always been too
good,

5&3: We're talking Spanish Weekend .

Rowe and Gould: Spanish, Slavic, Ger-
man, Russian . .

Gould: What we'd like to do is really in:
crease the turnout and participation oi the
whole campus in those events. We have
iilms where six people show up because the
only people who go are the people who live
in Spanish House.

Rowe: Another reason is that often we've
heard irom people even in those groups
that the only reason they go to the event is
because they have to go. it's mandatory, So
it doesn’t seem like we‘re‘ using our money
too productively it even the people who are
there don't Want to be there.

5&3: It people didn‘t want to be there in
the past, how are you going to change their
attitudes so they're going to want to be
there now?

Gould: We're going to have them work
with the total social calendar, like work
with Laura (Bradleyl; she has a lot more
connections {or a wider variety of ﬁlms and
Allison (Paich) has connections with
Georgia Dentel to get better speakers.
Hopelully, we can just try to broaden thein-
terest.

son: What are your direct respon-
sibilities?

Gould: As iar as the streamlining oi the'
» .hureaucracy- all that stems from

the

cabinet, The whole SRC was brainstormed
by the cabinet. We said we have this pro-
blem, we're tired of all the bureaucracy,
we can move on, we can provide the cam-
pus with something substantial. The
weekends thing, that was initiated by the
cablnet. The social Coordinator carries it
out but the decision as to what to do was
solved by the cabinet. Something else is the
short-term loan program, which i have
written up together with Amy Welsh lstu:
dent coordinator).

SStB: Brieﬂy explain that.

Gould: Because there's going to be no
more advancement in salaries. that means
that people who worked In August won't get
paid until October 10 and that's a long time
— it's almost fall break We feel that there
has to be some means for people to get
money because a lot or people depend on
that, on those wages, lor their entire social
life. So we've put together a short-term
loan program that we‘re going to try to
finance through the furniture auction,

5&3: How much do you expect to get.
from that?

Gould: Last year we made about $950

sdrB: Are your experiencing any pro-
blems so far this semester?

Gould: One of the problems that we're
having is that we're really looking ior
issues We don't have anything coming to
us. we don't have the F-grade, we don't
have anything slapping us in the lace say»
ing we have to do something. So it is taking
an extra ciiort to try to lind some issues,

5&3: So you're actually going out and
trying to round some up?

Rowe: l wouldn't say that.

Gould: We're trying to ﬁnd some causes
to work on.

5&3: What about some ol the old peren~
nlal issues”! What are your stands going to
be on Skip Day and Relays?

Gould: We thought a precedent was set
pretty well last year. We thought it worked
out real well to put the Skip Day money
towards Relays because Relays was very
successful

Rowe; That is, Skip Day in the spring.

5&3: So you're saying that ii the issue or
Skip Day comes up on a semester basis
right now. you will not put your support
behind it and you will instead suggest that
all the money be used tor a Relays at the
end oi uie year?

Rowe: You can somewhat say that, i
wouldn't say that any thought to putting in
some type oi event this semester has been
eliminated, The Spring Skip Day a there
seems a very good chance that will be put
into the Relays

Gould: There may be something totally
different There were ideas tossed around
last year oi having Spring Day or a Fall
Day or something on a Saturday that
wouldn't conflict with classes. 50 we will do
something

5&8: Why wouldn't you want to have it
on a school day?

Gould: The problem we had was that the
students were not supporting it ll we had
student support, we'd say, sure, let‘s do it.
But people were going to the library and
studying a the library was packed

Rowc: skip Day in the past was always
well attended, there were always massive
groups of people hanging around. But the
last couple ol years when we've had it,
when the laculty hasn't sanctioned it,
everybody's going to their classes and
some people said the laculiy even made an
