Crowd hears words of optimism for US.-

by Kevin L McKeough

A larger~thancapacity crowd flooded
Herrick chapel Wednesday evening to
hear former Congressman and UN.
Ambassador Andrew Young speak on
American foreign policy Young's
Thursday address on Civil rights was
moved to Darby gymnasium,
presumably due to Wednesday's large
turnrout.

The audience, composed of Grinnell
students, faculty and townspeople,
quickly used up the available main
floor seating and spread to the balcony
and sidesaisles. By the time President
George A. Drake stepped forward to in-
troduce Young, the crowd he termed
“the largest I have seen here" included
a group of students who sat on folding
chairs placed upon the chapel altar.

After receiving an enthusiastic recep-
tion, Young began his speech with a
chronization of U ,5. foreign policy since
the 19405. Using his encapsulated
history as a springboard, Young spoke
on the role of the United Nations and
nonrmilltary incentives in foreign
policy. These topics, as well as the
United States leadership role in foreign
affairs, were clearly the focus of
Young's speech, which lasted a little
over a hour.

Addressing the audience in a relaxed,
informal style throughout his speech,
Young defended the beleaguered
United Nations, emphasizing its
achievements and potential. Admitting
that the organization lost a great deal of
its effectiveness in the early ‘705, he
blamed LLS. stonewalling on the Viet»
nam conflict for the sag in the group's
usefulness. The former ambassador
was quick to add that the United Na»
Lions still hears hundreds of resolutions
every year, saying "the record of suc
cess in the UN. in somewhat limited,
but thank God there is no record of
failure . . for a failure would constitute
a world war."

Young, who spoke without notes,
cited a large number of experiences as
UN, ambassador in addition to
historical references as he highlighted
the recent Successes of U.S. foreign
policy. Chief among these were the
Camp David treaty between Israel and
Egypt, and the Panama Canal treaty.
Young indicated that the triumph of
such treaties was respect it won for the
United States.‘ ‘When we were willing to
stand up, and be right, and be wise, the
rest of the world [allowed us,” he said,
reaffirming his position that the United
States still counts among the leaders in
worldwide policy making.

Young argued that military might
was no longer a necessary tool in

January 30, 1981

foreign affairs. He emphasized the use
or education and economic support say~
ing that, despite present hostilities,
"the legacy of 50,000 iranian students
(educated) in America will prevail,"
and suggesting this was already the
case in many of the emerging African
nations receiving U.s. support.

Ronald Reagan's failure to em»
phasize this form of foreign policy
troubled the speaker, who indicated he
felt Reagan's attempts to increase the
U S.'s military might were misguided.
' ncreasing America‘s military budget
isn't going to make America stronger,
it's going to make it weaker," Young
said. Despite this fears, Young was
hopeful, a mood that characterized the
closing moments of his speech. He sug-
gested that smaller nations might
possibly also manipulate worldwide
economic interdependence in order to
force the United States to pursue more
pragmatic policies.

Young received a standing ovation
upon finishing his speech, and then set-
tled into a dominute question-and-
answer period. Promising to keep his
answers brief ”if the audience will keep
their questions brief," Young fielded
questions concerning foreign policy and
his own political plans, He admitted
that he was an unannounced candidate

for the Atlanta's mayoral seat, saying
that he felt there would be a good deal
of pressure placed on the Reagan ad
ministration by coalitions of bigrcity
mayors. When asked if he felt the Soviet
Union was a threatto the United States,
Young replied witha curt ”no." He add.
ed that he did feel any encroachment
upon iran would be a serious threat to
the Persian Gulf area, and later ex
pressed his concern that Cuba might
mount a series of tests on us, strength.

Upon finishing the questionrandr
answer period, Young once again
received a tumultous round of ap
plause, Immediately following the lec-
ture, Young attended a reception at
Grinnell House in his honor.

Earlier on Wednesday, Young visited
several classes, as well as holding a
series of press conferences, in the late
afternoon he held a questionrand-
answer session for Grinnoll students in
South Lounge At the session, Young
covered many of the subjects he refer-
red ttJ in Wednesday's lecture. He
discussed aspects of the Carter ad
ministration, which included an
analysis of several of the Carter cabinet
members. HIS stay on campus also m~
eluded several luncheons, one of which
was with the Concerned Black
Students.
