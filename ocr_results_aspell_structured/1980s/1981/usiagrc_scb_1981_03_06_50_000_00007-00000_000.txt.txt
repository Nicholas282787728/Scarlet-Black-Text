College awaits effects of budget cuts

by Seth Meisel

Recently in Washington. a little black
book listing the iteagan
administration's proposed cuts was the
hottest item around And since tiie
public announcement ol tliose cuts in-
terest has still not waned

Grinnell College is one institution
watching to see how it will be allot-ted
by government cuts 01 special concern
are the proposed cuts in college student
loans aitd scholarships. in the National
Science Foundation tNSP‘l. iii the Na
ttonal Endowment tor the Humanities
tNEHl and in the National Endowment
lor the Arts tNEAJ what cuts will ac-
tually be approved by Congress and
how the agencies decide to deal with
them are the unknown lactors.

It‘inanCial aid assistance is being
closely watched by educational institu-
tions around the country According to
Judith Harper ot the Financial Aid 0|-
tice at the University at Iowa. the cuts
will undermine the Middle income
Assistance Act at 1978. The Guaranteed
Student Loan program iGSLt is one or
the acts creations which will be greatly
reduced and tightened. To correct
abuses tn the system which administers
and subsidizes low interest bank loans
to students. loans will probably be
made dependent on the student's need.
Harper toresces that the revamped pro-
gram will use one of the three ap
proaches or a combination ot the three.

The lirst approach is to make the loan
dependent on a need analysis and the
amount ol the loan awarded would be
determined by the diltereiice between
aid already granted and the amount
needed. A second proposal would be to
place a ceiling on the income ot the 3p
plicant's family. Grinnell‘s Director ol
Admissions and Financial Aid John
Hopkitis agrees that this method is like
ly and places the ceiling around
$30-4U.00t) The third proposal is to in-
crease the interest aitd/or charge pay-
ment oi interest throughout the term oi
the loan.

Three programs. National Direct Stu
dent Loans tNDSLt. Basic Opportunity
Grants tBEOGl and the Supplelneiir
tary Educational Opportunity Grant
isEoci which are targeted toward
lower and lower-middle income
families are also lacing cuts but proe
babiy not as extensive as GSL laces.
One program sale from cuts seems to
be the Work Study Program This is one
ot the most popular assistance proe
grams on Capitol Hill because. as ”are
ris explained. "Congressmen like to see
students work lor their education.

These programs represent a substan»
tial traction ot the Financial Aid ot-
l‘ices budget. Hopkins reported the
sums this year are $109 282 tor SE06.
$375,169 tor NDSL and $1 1.544 for Work
Study whether these ligures will rise
or tall in the next liscal year is still
unknown. However, the tact that Grins
nell did not receive additional aid in its
midyear appeal tor the lirst time in

March 0, l98l

yt" s is portcntious Because ol this
uncertainty the litiaricial aid decisions
that are usually sent out alter spring
break will be delayed this year.

Deep cuts in NSF threaten to end
many ol tts educational programs
science magaztiie reports that the pro
posed cuts. $52 million ror tiscal year
1981, and $241 million for fiscal year
1932, will mainly allect nsr's support
pl scientific education Included in this
category is a $75 million fund aimed at
upgrading college and university scien-
titic equipment.

Curricular development and student
reseaich programs will also be reduc-
ed Behavioral sciences will feel the
crunch first and hardest because 0|
Nst-"s longstanding bias toward the
"hard sciences Three programs at
Ui'innell are funded under NSF grants
but none seem threatened yet tine such
program is the biology department‘s
$183,000 grant tor curricular develop-
ment. Brut-e voyles ot the biology
department said that the chemists have
little tear of a reduction in lunds
because most at the money has already
been spent on renovating the project's
lab.

The Undergraduate Research Pare
ticipation Program is also tunded by
NSF Gene Wubbels. who heads the pro
grant that employs six students during
the summer. doubts that there will be
any interruption in lunding until at
least laaz, Psychology Prolessor
Thomas Brozoski also has no apprehen-
sion over the i te ol his department‘s
grant lroni N ‘ lor educational scien-
ttlic equipment For Brozoski. the com-
mitment ot money trom NSF

represents a contract and he doubts.

that NSF would renege on its funding

with the NEH too the concern is
about how great the cuts will actually
be and whether the NEH Will decide to
concentrate on research or education.
Grinnell now takes advantage ot the
grants NEH distributes tor seminars
and summer research. I-‘our Grinnell
laculty members participate in sumr

mer seminars last year with NEH
grants and two have applied this year.
A $460,000 matching grant was recently
awarded to Grinnell for renovation of
the library. acquisitions tor the library
and the creation of a chair in the
Humanities. Oneethird of the money has
already been received and the rest
should be obtained by the end of the
year.

So how will Grinnell be affected? NSF
seems certain to turn away lrom educa-
tional programs it the proposed cut in
its budget occurs. Grinnell would be
hurt in this respect and would either
have to eliminate programs or rund
them by private sources, i-iow NEH will
reconcile its cuts is more complicated.
It could either eliminate some pro-
grams or cut the whole budget propor-
tionally, which would increase competi-
tion tor remaining money. Grinnell has
its own research lurid but it can only
give grants of around summon and
doesn't provide stipends If this all
sounds depressing it may be cornlorting
to know that Grinnell is in a much more
Secure situation financially than most
other schools.

At the University of Iowa the cuts will
mean that the University will probably
have to give up many at the “luxuries"
which make a school special. Mary
Jane McLaughlin oi the grants depart-
ment said the cuts may mean the
elimination at less popular musical pro
grams at Hancher Auditorium, special
exhibits at the art museum. summer
seminars. writing institutes and its
publication lowa Review. Because
federal money often acts as a catalyst
for private donations because of their
matching and challenge grants. the loss
in funds will be severe.

Grinnell should be more fortunate Its
strong tradition or private donations,
large endowment and its
”sell'rrellance" will probably allow
Grinnell to fare much better than most
schools through the lorthcoming cuts,
though that doesn‘t mean it may nDt
also hurt.

Pub’ers rededicate Corner

by Steve Burnett
I'm going to the Pub to do a story tor
the 5&3."

”Right “

"Really. lam!”

And I did

A sea oi humanity enjoyed I0 cent
draws Wednesday to help celebrate the
rededication of Worley‘s Corner The
entire Pub board was needed to pour
the brew because ol the large crowd.

Jack Worley himselt was present and
he commented. “It was a party and it
was a good one '

An tnlorinal tribute was opted for
because. as Kevin Crim, laculty
member to the board, said, "We wanted
people to be happy. At this time of the
year 1 think the students could ape

preclate it more." Worley commented,
"Any excuse to have a party. .

Worley's Corner originated during
the '76—'77 school year when a room was
added to the Pub. A name for it was
needed and since Wurley had been in
strumental in founding and patronizing
the Pub, the additinn was christened
Worley's Corner and a sign was painted
on the wall to prove it.

When the Pub was "renovated" last
summer the sign was covered by paint.
Because Worley was on leave first
semester, the board waited until now to
rededicate the Corner,

Ii numbers are any gauge of success,
this party was a smash as suds to the
tune of 1,100 glasses llowedt 7
