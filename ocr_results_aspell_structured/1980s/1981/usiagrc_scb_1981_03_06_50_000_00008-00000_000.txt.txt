In i945 Infantry Officer Charles
Cleaver was sent to Japan to serve dur-
ing the United States' postwar occupar
tion ot that country. Now protessor or
English and American Studies, Cleaver
attributes to that first visit the beginn-
ing of a “love affair that has grown
slowly” ever since

Returning to Grinnel] this semester
after spending the last year teaching at
Keio (pronounced ”kayo"l University
in Tokyo, Cleaver sat down with the
sails to discuss some of the experiences
and to mlk about the differences and
similarities in the Japanese and
American cultures.

when Cleaver was lirst sent to Japan
in 1945, the war had just ended and the
people of both cultures, who werenow
lorced to live together, knew only the
propaganda about each other that their
governments had spread. “We landed
lull or wartime propaganda," cleaver
said. "And we were greeted by smiling
people and a warm welcome " Cleaver
explained that he felt most of the
soldiers sent to Japan during the 00
cupatlun quickly lost all their
propaganda-induced notions of the
Japanese and began to really learn
what they were all about.

The Japanese, similarly, were also
expecting ditlerent actions trom the his
coming American troops. “They had
had progaganda too," Cleaver said.
"They expected a group oi barbarians
who would go around raping and pillag-
ing." Cleaver, who gave a very positive
image or die conduct or the American
troops during the occupation, said that
he felt both groups of people "surprised
each other."

cleaver explained that he ten most
Japanese now look back on the occupar
tion years as bemg good ones for their
country. "The Japanese say that it's
good that they lost the war,“ Cleaver
said. The country was devastated by
the war and the general living condi-
tions were very poor. ”I've seen Japan
change from the day when people would
steal from my garbage cans looking for
food." Cleaver explained. “Now I see
Tokyo as a city with a very high

average standard of living, There is
very little unemployment and the gap
between the rich and the poor is not
very great, They also have no such
things as slums as we know them:

Noting that the United States Still has
naval and air bases in Japan, Cleaver
talked about the teeling the Japanese
have {or our country today He explain
ed that the first treaties the Americans
Signed with the Japanese were unfair
ones and that "interestingly enough,
they (the Japanese) won their way to
equality with the United States by
fighting the Russians' Cleaver said
this topic is no longer in the minds of the
Japanese.

Asked ii there was any animosity
toward the United States left over from
the war years Cleaver, alter a long
pause, oilered this answer. "There are
no more anllsUts, demonstrations but
their campuses, like ours, aren't as
politically active anymore. They feel
that racism hasn't disappeared here
and they look on the Vietnamese war as
a racist war.‘ He went on to explain

 

that there are some Japanese who still
have reservations about some
American conduct but that no open op-
position towards the United States ex-
isls in Japan today

Cleaver lclt Japan alter the occupas
lion only to be called back again during
the Korean War In which he served as a
military historian at General Heads
quarters in Tokyo. Coming back to the
United States he again returned to
Japan tor ti year in 1963 as a lecturer on
a Fulbright scholarship.

Cleaver’s llto most recent trips to
Japan have taken place in the last six
years. In 1975 Cleaver and his wife Sara
spent a year in Tokyo at waseda
University where cleaver served as
resident director of the ACM'S Japan
studies program. The program is an ex
change program sending ACM students
to Waseda, Japan‘s second oldest
university, and bringing students to the
United States to attend ACM schools.
This year three Waseda students are
here at Grinnell while three Grin»
nelllans are In Tokyo,
