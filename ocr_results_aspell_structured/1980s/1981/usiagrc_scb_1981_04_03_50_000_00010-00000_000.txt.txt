meetings easier to participate in so
studens don't have to hesitate coming
to a Joint Board meeting to speak their
mind on an issue. That's whatSGA is all
about: students voicing their opinions
about their school concerns.

{A major part at the SGA Vicar
president's responsibility is to iniorm

students about campus issues. This'

should include everything from
deciding which concerts to bring to
campus to the Health Center move. The
student surveys distributed by the
Finance Committee showed that with a
little eifort on SGA’S part. the student
body is interested enough to give their
input, I feel this should be a continued
procedure when decisions need to be
made. A short all-campus survey would
provide direct opinion from me student
body to assist social programmers in
making decisions about specific
possibilities.

The time I spent as hall president,
assistant student coordinator and stun
dent coordinator in the past two years
has exposed me to many situations and
people. As student coordinator l

service I am establishing through the
student coordinator's oiiice is the pure

transportation to local concerts. Lastly,
many students have taken advantage of
a tree liquor store shuttle which has
been full each time it runs. Many of the
new services I initiated stemmed from
focusing on student needs. As vice-

student ideas and opinions and respon

To start this oil, I'm going to be very
honest. First of all, as a freshman, I
don't have a whole lot or experience in
SGA, and, on paper, I don't have the
qualifications that the other candidates
have. But these shortcomings don't
matter to me because I feel I can offer
something very positive to SGA and to
make that contribution I'm going to
have to be honest with everyone.

I ieel very strongly that in these
shortcomings lie my real strengths, 1
mean, being honest, I can't make any
specific promises I'll accomplish as
vice-president. I can't say where I'll
stand on any specilic issues because
I'm still learning about all the issues.
What I can give to SGA is what I feel
SGA needs most: a stronger appeal to
the student body and a little en-
thusiasm, Ever since I arrived at Grins
nell in August, it seems like I've found
nothing but a pessimistic and negative
attitude toward SGA. I really think this
attitude is tragic. The reason for this at-
titude seems to be because SGA doesri't
appeal to and participate with the
whole Student body, The majority of
students here just don‘t want to get in»
volved in SGA

1 heel I can really help solve this pro-
blem because what I can give best to
SGA is my spirit and enthusiasm, Peo-
ple have sometimes told me that i can
talk too much and act crazy sometimes
but I leel this is what SGA needs SGA
needs a little lite, My main goal is to

Ten Gould

add this life to SGA so that SGA
becomes more appealing to the
students and then, hopetully, they‘ll
want to become more involved.

In conclusion, this enthusiasm and in-
volvement is what I can best ol’ier, I'm
not the most qualified or experienced
candidate but maybe SGA needs a new
and fresh change. I can't make any "11'
pressive campaign promises or boast DI
impressive credentials. I just feel SGA
needs to be shaken up a little and given
a more positive image and I would reals
ly like to be given a chance to help. it
this whole speech makes me sound
rather inexperienced, that's what I've
got to alter: a new, iresh. innocent
change,
