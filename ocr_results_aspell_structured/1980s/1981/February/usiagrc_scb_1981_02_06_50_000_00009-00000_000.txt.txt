lionship oi hostility But what \Hll hapr
pen is that we'll sell them iai'msi to the
lsraelis or Egyptians and they ll sell
’em to them because Israel doesn't
want Iraq to win that war

I guess I think that what you get is a
need to talk macho 7 but I don't think il
can be backed up But you see they
created a perception that America is
viezik; American is not vieak. But non
that they have convmced the American
people that America is weak and the
majority ot American people voted tor
them, they have got to do something to
convince the American people that
American is strong. So they can make a
few statements like this; talkin tough,
reassure evei; body- and then go on to
busmess as us al General Jones talkr
ing about sinking Russnin ships and
stull like that , that’s war games
rhetoric or \lhat we would call on the
block, selling noll tickets, Those men
are much too intelligent and much too
responsible to act on that basis. And in
today s world i don't think they can
9; \‘ou'ie had a long history in ciiil
rights. What do you consider to be the
major gains that blacks and minorities
havcinadc silicetiie tho-u :“lintiio you
feel are still the major problem. '.’

A: I think the major gains have been
politic 1, educational. economic.
Politi ally. the number oi black elected
oilicials has steadily increased.
Economically, their income has in
creased lrom about $50 billion annually
in 1960 to $127 billion in 1980 Educ
tionaily, you had maybe a quarter (it a
million blacks in college in the early
'50s. you have over a million blacks in
college now These are phenomenal
gains

what has happened, though, is that
we have not distributed those gains
evenly throughout the black communi-
ty, So the biggest problems are those
black citizens and poor citizens,
gencrally, who have not participated in
the progress that the rest oi as have.
And that's the hardcore unemployed.
But the problem there is not so much
blacks as it is the stagnation ol the
economy And so to get something done,
to bring blacks into the mainstream. l
think \\e have to have more economic
growth and productivity,

l would also say that the presence oi
the Klan and the so-called resurgence
ol the Klan IS an indication that there
are a lot of poor while Iolk that have not

it, February o, 198i

participated in the educational and
economic advances ol the nation. Arid
so they are acting like they used to act
in the last century. The answer to that,
though, is to bring them in to the
mainstream, too

Q: What ettect will the resurgence oi
the Klan have?

A: Well. I think that during the Nixon
tnlaking a quacking noise twice, he
caught his mistake and corrected it)
Reagan campaign they tthe Klan)
thought they were getting a signal that
they had a friend in the White House
who was going to put the niggers in
their place, I think that since his elec-
tion Reagan has tried to dispell that to
some extent, But I think he‘s going to do
a lot more to make it certain that the
Klan activity and mentality is unaccep-
table in-Amei‘ica, In the absence of
that, I think that there will be additional
incidents of violence and there will be
pockets or racial problems 7 but i don't
see this as an overwhelming setback.

Q: You described your time in in the
United salions as the biggest hustle
there is . . ,

A: . . , I said that it you Viant a good husV
tlethal‘sit. Its almost as good as going
to school.

Q: Do you liiid it less restrictive not
working as part ot the system?

-\: I don't lind much restriction In the
system. 1 saw myself as haying con-
tributed to creating that lthe Carteri
administration While it was true that I
was the president’s appointee and was
loyal to him and the secretary at state, I
also represented a minority and liberal
constituency Within the Democratic
Party . There was nobody else in the ad-
ministration saying things that they
thought they were voting for. I felt a
loyalty to the constituency that 1
represented in the administration. i
didnt hesitate to speak out publicly to
help shape policy, once policy was
determined. though, I supported it and
worked |0r it. But I tried to anticipate
what the policy needs were and start a
public dialogue on those needs before
the policy decisions were made. I think
that's the way policy decisions should
be made in a democracy

Q' “hut‘ your rctlec ons about the
' ~ti~i u to Ilouse tears?

.\ I think these have been tor
phenomenal years

ti. In what respects:

A. In terms oi really establishing

America‘s respectand credibility in the :
world. The Panama Canal treaty, the I
Middle East peace. ..lmean. when we 3
were elected everybody was talking -
about the next war in the Middle East. '
it never came because oi Camp David.

I think about the removal of Soviet in- .
[luence from Africa. The one place that .
he didn‘t succeed was in the economy L
and he didn't succeed in the economy 1
because he didn't realize the extent to «
which economic policy must be intern
Lionally determined.

One thing Carter did do was include
minorities in the decision making of the
government. There were 41 blacks that.
became lederal judges for lite. That's
going to be a tremendous legacy for
long time to come. It will be the ,
bulwark of defense against some 0! the
aggressive tactics of the Reagan ad-
ministration. At least you can slow
down some or the reactionary things for ,
[our years. i
q- Do you have speciiic worries tor th_e' .
next tour years? ;~
A' I think we re going to have specilic' -
disagreements but i think we can win:
"em 1,
Q' Who Is we?

A: Us, who disagree. Whoever us are
0‘ Does have a better play when.
w mayor at Atlanta than when.
we re just writing a syndicated (501-:
um"?
A- iLong pause) We re probably better. i
ol'ldolng both. And I in going to stay ac-
tive in the Democratic Party. the Na-
tional league ot Cities and the National
Conlerenee of Mayors.
Q: What do you see going on on college
campuses compared to when you: -
ted Grinnell ll yenrs ago?
A. Its different but it doesnt bother
me. Now its like it as when lwas in
college. when l was in college we didn‘t ;
do anything but gool all. We studied -
enough to stay there — nobody was pal-1 .
ticuiarly ambitious. There were no ,
causes. we had a good time, But we‘
basically prepared ourselves tor liie.
And 1 think that a quiescent period on a -
college campus doesn't upset me that :
much because I came out of one. The 1
end result tor me was to be committed- _
loi- lite to a struggle [or social Justice .
and socxal change.

I think what I saw out 01 a lot at
students during the 505 was that they
spent their college years being very
radical and then they settled down and
