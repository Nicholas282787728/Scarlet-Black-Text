Grinnell in his talk and point out some
events he sees as highlights or his term.
He includes in this list the Convocation

people to the Campus " Martin Luther
King, Jr. and Marshall McLuhan were
among these people who spent [our
days on campus in the dorms and iacul-

he ieels are notable are the change 0]
the residence system in 196768 from

the changes that occurred in the
physical appearance or the Campus and
the alterations in iacuity policies.

speech isn‘t a speech iull oi conilict, but
I hope it will attract attention."
