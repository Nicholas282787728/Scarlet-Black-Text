Drake names Parslow 1982-83: coordinator

for curriculum discussion
Faculty chair calls job description vague

by Jeff Raymond

Morris rats-low, chairman ol the lacula
ty. has been tabbed by Presidenl George
Drake to be the coordinator for curricular
dlbcussion in the 1982-83 academic year
This declSlon. announced Dec, 2. lollows
meetings between Drake, Dean oi the
Faculty Catherine Frazier and a low l'acula

, ty members. Parslow did not expect to be
named but Drake pointed to Parsiow‘s
knowledge ol the college and his two terms
as iaculty chairman as evidence ot his
respect among the laculty and as reasons
tor the decision.

Al the open lorum meeting on the pro»
posed core-curriculum on Nov, 23, Drake
said tliat he would shortly make and
disclose his selection tor a coordinator oi
curriculum development. This person
would investigate and submit a report on
the proposed curriculum change. Drake
said that he wanted to name a single in-

dividual lrom within the college rather
than a committee because ol the awkward-
ness ol a committee and because practical
experience told hlm that a committee
would not work well.

Parslow said that the job description
was somewhat vague and that he would
have to “invent responsibilities" oi the
coordinator. lie will collect inlorniation on
the state oi a Grinnell College education
Although Drake said 75 to to percent oi
Grinnell graduates receive actual liberal
arts educations. Parslow said that there
are no deiinite iigures on present classes.
He will collect ideas and opinions both
irom the students and laculty members
belore collating and evaluating the tin-
dings and sending his report to the Cur-
riculum Committee, the Executive Council
and the iaculty

Unlike the big meeting ol Nov n,
Parslow plans to meet with students and
laculty in small groups and on an in-
dividual basis. He had no exact procedures
ior this yet. but ielt thatthelarge meetings
were too inellicient. Drake noted, though.
that the meeting did allow people to air
some ideas and that inlormation ilowed
both ways He said that students became
better inlormed about what was happening
and the administration wa 'made cognia
zant of ideas and opinion ,
Core—curriculum, or at least a more
structured curriculum, has always been
an issue and has always been supported by
at least a minority or the iaculty accora
ding to Parslow This lall. the issue was
iinally brought up in a lormal proposal lor
consideration. when students heard oi the
proposal. many were alraid oi how they
would be aiiected. However. the investiga-

tion will not begin until this summer and
will take a lull year to complete. so the
report won't be sumbllled to the faculty
until the ion ot 1983 No currently enrolled
students will be aliected, only students
enrolled alter lall. 1984, when this year‘s
high school sophomores will be college -
lreshmen, Drake said that he was proud oi

, the students tor still showing concern even
alter they learned that they wouldn't be
directly aliected.

Both Drake and Parslow remarked that
the core—curriculum decismn will be a ma-
jor one and so they are being very careiul
about how they approach it. "This is a very
big decision. We won't take it lightly, said
Drake. Parslow reiterated that his main
role was that of a coordinator and warned:
"i am not Zeus One should not expect
Athena to spring irom my head."
