\ Grihnell explores new telephone options

by Anne Stein

An article appeared in the November
1979 issue of the 5&3, which described
the many problems we all encounter
With telephone servrce at Grinnell: in»
ability to get an outSide line, slowness
of operator answering and the [act that
there were only 19 trunks iiinesi serv-
ing over 1,200 people.

Well, believe it or not the system has
improved a little and greater ""7
provements are on the way, although
perhaps not ior a iew more years

Studies are now being done by Dale
l-lawn, head oi the physical plant, in
cooperationg with GTE's marketing
manager Roy Tyndall, to iind a ieasible
system tor the school. Tyndall and
Hawn have discussed dlfterent systems
open to the college and “traffic studies"
have beeli made to determine when the
phones are most busy.

The studies, which monitor telephone
use during two»week periods, show that
at peak hours m about 10:31) pm. to
midnight every night 7 phone etiicien-
cy is very low; that is, lines are ex-
tremely busy and people often have a
hard time getting a call into the college.
The worst night is Sunday when, out at
100 tries, zoos times an attempt to get
out or in will be met with a busy signal,

This means that trying to make a call
on a Sunday night is frustrating and
that one would be better off not calling
at all What the phone company aims
for, and it the college had about 19 more
lines, would be one busy signal out oi
100 tries

Why doesn't the college provide up-
timal service? The reasons are many.
First oi all, phone technology has moi/r
ed ahead rapidly and the college equip
ment, though relatively young in was
installed in 1967) is already obsolete.
Thus, the college is faced with the pro-
blem of investing money — a huge
amount of money — into a new phone
system to improve the present one.
Why not install more trunks? Because
the extra trunks are only needed from
around 10:30 pm. until midnight, Dur-
ing regular business hours, the phones
run quite well ~ reaching the "one busy
in 100 tries" optimum Thus, the large
investment in trunks is not really worth
the small use they will receive.

Another option is to otter phones in
the rooms of students who Wish them.
Uniortunately, this would take away
the advantages tyes. advantages) oi
the hall phone, Assuming that not
everyone would get his own phone, a
hall phone would Still be needed But
those with their own phones would pron
bably not answer the hall phone.
(Would you, knowing the call would not
lie ior you?) Thus. many phone calls

ouid not be answered and messages

ould not be taken,

li a parent, or whomever, calls on the
hall phone, chances are pretty good the
student might not get a message of the
call It the hall phone was eliminated 7
well, not everyone would want to pay to
have his own phone and, thus, some
students would be left without phone
service. And surprisingly, said l-lawn,
"Some students are glad the phone is
down the hall and not in their room to
interrupt them.“

There are a raw things all phone users
can do to improve eiiiciency “Herd
books" are made up each year by l-lawn
to provide the names and numbers oi
tacuity and students Calling the
operator (or a number listed in the
Herdbook is a waste of time and a waste
of a trunk,

when talking to someone otlrcampus,
try to limit your call to a reasonable
time, as you are using one oi only 19
trunks. Remember also that there is one
ly one college operator, so when an out:
side caller calls in at peak times and the
phone rings 20 times or some other
ridiculous amount, it is because there
are a number oi other people trying to
get through and the operator can only

deal with them one at a time. Tell long
distance callers that to avoid frustrar
tron they should avoid peak hours, exe
peciaily Sunday nights And why is
there only one operator? Because with
the exception oi these low hours at
night, one operator is sutiicient to han-
dle all college calls.

Basically, students and iaculty ”have
to be aware of the limitations of the
equipment," said Hawn, and act accor-
dingly When calling outside the col-
lege, with the exception oi the use oi
payphones and room phones, one is
sharing 19 lines with l,2oo people and
anyone else trying to call the college.

The college has yet to decide on the
best use of funds for telephone service,
although it deiinitely sees, as Hahn
said, "the need for improvements.” By
the beginning of next semester, George
Drake and Waldo Walker will be
presented with a report outlining die
options the college has concerning a
new phone system, And perhaps in a
tow years, phone service here will be
like phone seerce "at home," etiicrent
and not frustrating to the user.
