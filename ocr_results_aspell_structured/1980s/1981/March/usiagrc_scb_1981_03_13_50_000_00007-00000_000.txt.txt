Specializing vs. learning at Grinnell ‘

To the Editor

If Scholar-Athlete Weekend is an op»
portunity to show prospective students
(who happen to be interested in sports)
what Grinnell is like, then I am all [or
it. If Scholar-Athlete Weekend is an op
portunity to woo athletes with possible
athletic scholarships and false talk of a
commitment to a winning program (or
some such rot), lam totally against it,

Now don't get me wrong. There is
nothing inherently wrong with winning
or doing anything else well. It gives one
a satisfying feeling, a ieeling oi aria
complishment within. But it satisﬁes
only so far as it is felt that one is
reaching closer to personal potential, 1
have ielt good about 'my perlormance
arter losing in competition. Winning in
itself should not be ultimately impor-
tant but the inherent value in experien-
cing and improving oneself should be.
This has been the past philosophy in
Grinnell athletics, a philosophy sure to
be lost with athletic recruitment and a
commitment to winning.

Besides making winning the ultimate

goal in athletics, recruitment would
also serve to predetermine the direc-
tion that these students would follow at
Grinnell. It would be Sad to see these
freshmen enter Grinnell with such firm
preconceived ideas about what direc-
tions their college life will iollow. Grin-
nell is a time for exploring and devoting
energy to ditterent creative endeavors,

Specializing 7 that's what big
schools do and what big technologies do
and what big sports do. At U. of State
you have football players who can't
read, English majors who don’t care {or
business and business students who
can't throw a football. Higher education
is specializing,

Learning 7 that's what goes on at
Grinnell. A general dabbling in many
dilterent things — music, history,
politics. football — one person can try

I don‘t want to see Grinnell start to
specialize in anything speciﬁc 7 winn~
ing in iootbail via athletic recruitment
or having the very best political science

department in the country e because
that will tend to draw muse who are
already interested in specializing and,
thereiore, learning will be lost. The op-
portunities at Grinnell will be forgotten
or closed for both the specialists and
other Grinnellians. I want Grinnell to
specialize only in learning. the general
potpourri, the real thing. ‘

Finally, some may worry that Grin-
hell would lose the true scholar-athleth
without recruitment. It these athletes
want to come to Grinnell without
scholarships, then they will come and
be welcome assets. Ii any of these
“scholar-athletes" would not want to
come without recruitment. then they
are not the type {or Gn'nnell A they
want the prestige or the label “athlete"
(which may not be found at Grinnelll
and they have narrowed ideas about
their college life. It would be best"
these people went to “school"

He sees the coming of the "New'Grinnell"

To the Editor:

Having found myself with some unex-
pected free time lately, i thought I
would check out some of the activities
around campus. Being one of those peer
ple who usually throw away the Memo
in despair at not being able to (ind time
to participate in more of them, this was
a somewhat enlightening experience
for me. You see i think l've begun to see
a few results of the real or imagined
changes occurring at the college, I
think I really see the coming of what
some of the prols have called the “New
Grinnell."

My lirst awakening was probably
precipitated by a friend and person of
consideration, Russell Pierce. Joining

something about what I interpreted to
be a kind ot production-line liberalism.
From that time I began to look at my

three members of the basketball crowd

A set of points “pro” and “con" tor

Either these people were all friends or
they were all connected with the SGA. A
vague idea that son “types” weren't so
bad after all began to form. I don’t
know who drew up the points oi the
argument but it became clear that
there was a common trend of thought
throughout. Never mind how we ended
up with an “A, B, C, D" system instead
at an “A. B, C, D, F” one. Never mind
the arguments about overemphasis on
grades and the silly notion that
academic standards have anything [to

people were really concerned about
was the idea that at present a “D'3 is
