students wanting to get experience in a
iieid they are interested in it's a good
bridge between academic lite and the
real world, I would encourage students
to look into it," said Sue Schleifer, in-
ternship coordinator at Career Ser

the internship related to the student s
academic program. In addition the stur
dent must either complete background
readings or participate in a related
seminar the ioiiowing semester. This
semester 16 students are involved in in»
ternships. which Schleiler said is an
average number.

According to several interns, the pro
gram is a positive one. Rosemary
Strunk interned last year at the
Neighborhood Development Agency in
Des Moines. "I had thought 01’ going m7
to government work but it turned me on
because 01 the bureaucratic mess. It
was a positive experience in that it
showed me exactly what I didn't want
to do," said Strunk. “The experience is
unique because the people you work
with know you are a student so it‘s okay
il‘ you make mistakes."

"The program is organized wonder-
lully, ’ said Lynn Rossman, an intern at
the Poweshlek County Mental Health
Center. An anthropology major,
Rossman is investigating what social
services are like by working with the
Center‘s Community Support Program.
"1 think it‘s really worthwhile," she
said. "it‘s unique to Grinnell because at
a large school there wouldn't be this op-
portunity. '

"It made me realize whats
involved." said Dan Dunlap, who is
presently interning at Grinnell Mutual
Reinsurance to learn about investment
portrolio management, "You have to
ask a lot of questions or people you work
with to tinol out what you want to
know," he said. "It takes more time
than a regular iourcredit course but

the work is definitely not as demati.;
ding, it consists mostly of describing-
your experience and it is very in
dividualized."

Rossman believes the workload is
about equal to that or a regular tour-
credit course but that the work is more »
enjoyable so it doesn't seem as deman-
ding. Strunk emphasized the time fac-
tor oi the program. "My internship was g
very demanding and took a lot of com»
mitment," she said, "However, it's well
worth the time because you get prac-
tical experience, which {or a liberal“
arts major is great because you can ap-
ply the theoretical stuir you've learned _
in the classroom.‘

To set up internships, Schleiier talks
to students about their interests goals
and skills, identities several agencies
which match the student 5 interests and
contacts them tor the students. For the
partrtime program, she arranges a
meeting With the work sponsor, iaculty:
