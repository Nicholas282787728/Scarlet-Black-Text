nondertut as the girl uho picks him up

It has been Said that the British lack al‘
coherent lilm identity but they have
traditionally made at least one type or

lrom their literary or historical
heritage, The band Lean versions at
Charles Dickens and Noel (innards
uorlcs are pert‘ect examples Blithe
spirit is Lean's adaptation oi Coward’s
longsrunning tantasttc play. an amus»
mg and bizarre comedy about I! British
novelist tHarrtsonJ haunted during his
second marriage by the ghost 01 the
ville from his first. Her intrusive and
obstinate demand to remain a part at
his lite causes a number or problems.
especially a iih the living lute and calls

tiondertully played by Margaret
Ruthertol‘d '

’l’he iantasy oi the lllnl is exemplary
at many British iilms at that time; tor
the most part the British stuck vt ith the
literary and historical adaptations
prevalent in the pre-vtar era rather
than turning to more realistic con-
siderations as ttaty and the United
States did
