S— Israeli Relations»

From the Army
to Hebrew U

by Laura Allender

when I was ten years old my parents
made a sudden decision-they decided to
realize a lifelong dream and attempt to
make “aliyah.” lpronounced ahrleeryah)
to Israel. “Aliyah," which literally means
“going up" in Hebrew. is just another way
of saying that my family decided to im-
migrate to Israel.

In addition to this decision. my parents
concluded that they wished to try out life
on a kibbutz (pronounced kee-booet-s). A

, kibbulz is a communal living Settlement
which bases its economy on the socialist
model. produces agricultural and in
dustrial products for sale in the Israelii
and international markets as well as pro-
viding ail necessities and some basic lux»
uries for its members.

Although the idea of kibbutz was very
appealing to my parents. the kibbutz we
chose was too industrial. too socially
stagnated and too antirintellectual for a
family raised in a liberal. politically active
and collegerdominated community of a
large United States city. After one year.
with little hope of finding a niche for
ourselves on the kibbutz. we returned to
Chicago with the good and bad memories
oi the mind—expanding experience of living
in a foreign country.

. As we packed our bags to leave the kib-
butz. I knew I had to come back,

Last summer. my dream of the past
eight years came true. Ifinally went back
to Israel. I went with several goals, One
was to find the pieces I had left behind and
try and ﬁgure out what had actually hap-
pened to me while I was in Israel. I needed
to iind out who I was then and to compare
it to me. the sophomore at Grinnell Cola
lege. Finally, I needed to iind out why i
could love a country so much. when all of
my memories were bad.

When I arrived in Israel, I began to un
cover the answers to these quations. I
loved Israel because there. for the first
time. I belonged. Although I never belongr
ed on the kibbutz. the country belonged to
me. For once l was in the majority. For
the short time I was in Israel" I was in a
nation where I no longer had to explain my
Jewish religion or culture; if anything I
had to explain my lack or it.

Despite this. I have no objections to
sharing that special place. It is for
everyone to enjoy: Arabs. Jews, Chris
tians. Bedoulns. Druses and all of the other
clans who seem to be so attracted to the on»
ly oil-free Middle Eastern national.

During our three-month summer vacar
tion 1 had time to go on two programs. The
first, Volunteers for Israel. is a program
which allows one really to find out what it
ls like to be a part of the Israeli army. The
second was an intensive Hebrew course at
the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Immediately after arriving in Israel. I
was taken to a “tank" base near Ashkelon.
a city on the Mediterranean. 0ur
counselor and leader was a sergeant ma-
jor in the army. As a career soldier. when
he wasn't inspecting tanks he was looking
after his American. British. Canadian.
French and South African charges. The
2000 soldiers and career soldiers who
worked on the base were helped every day
or the year by his 30 foreign volunteers bet-
ween the ages of 18 and 65

For three Weeks I was “Yosi s assistant
truck mechanic " it was probably one or
the most rewarding jobs I will ever do.
Yosi knew two words in English-“brake”
and “jack". But with the help of my
childhood Hebrew and with a lot of arm
waving, pointing and demonstration, we
took t es off and put new ones on. changed

 

Issues and Perspectives in the News

U.S. relations with Israel can be
characterized as tense. Although the U. S.
is dedicated to supporting Israel incidents
have occurred such as the case of Israel
spying on the U. S a few years ago and
before that the US sale of AWACS to
Saudi Arabia that have tested the bonds
which link us.

between Israelis and Americans can be

and discovered that we really were having
fun. Occasionally. Iwould think about the
probable comforts of an American army
base. The idea only made me more glad
that l was giving something to that country
whose existence will always mean that I
have a place to be.

Every citizen of Israel is drafted into the
army at the age of is, in a nation as small
as 3 million. with potential enemies at
every side. conscription is imperative to
the survival of the country.

One of the consequences of the lifts
minence of war in Israel is the separation
of the roles of men and women in their
society. In Israel. sexism is much more
present in the attitudes of men and women
than it is In America today . When I asked
Israeli women to explain why men in
Israel were often so chauvinsitic or pushy,
they told me that it was because o[ war
Although both Israeli men and women are
draited into the army. only Israeli men go
into combat. This fact. along with the in-
fluence of religious restrictions. has
limited the invasion of equal rights ideals
into Israel.

Israeli women explain that men put their
lives on the line for the country. so they
must be spoiled. If you ask most American
women who have dealt wlth or talked to
Israeli men they will agree that Israeli
men are generally spoiled. s

This custom creates some of the striking
differences between Jews raised in North
American countries and Jews raised in
israel. Relationships and approaches to
relationships are very different. With the
premise oi equality changed back to its
older form-separate but equal-roles are
much more clearly defined. For example.
if an Israeli man asks a woman out to dlnr
ner. he will be offended if she offers to pay
or attempts to suggest that they “go
Dutch".

Another consequence of keeping a stan
ding army is the Israeli attitude towards
guns. On the base. if a soldier was on night
guard duty he was given a gun by his
superior until the morning. On a hot night.
when it was difficult to sleep. it was Comr

guard would be sitting next to you with the

your side, Catching your breath you would
calmly ask him to move the gun and he
would oblige.

Israeli Stereotypes

- by Janet Silverstein

I hate stereotypes" .but before I went to

. tour Israel in the summer of 1985. people

warned me that lsraelites are generally
more aggressive than Americans and that
I should be careful of pushy ‘Israeli
salespersons (because “they will try to rip
you off if you’re not firm with them.”l

Then after I arrived. an American living
in Israel informed me that Israeli men
consider Western women. and American
women in particular, “easy." She at-
.tributed this stereotype primarily to
television and movie images of American
women which differ vastly from the roles
Isaeli women play in society.

During my tour I had several encounters
which might at first seem to confirm these
negative stereotypes of Israelis. However.
upon closer examination. I discovered
that the diiierences in benaVior were not
results of fundamental negative character
traits of Israelis but rather differences in
the Israeli and American cultures that led
to misunderstandings,

At the first Israeli shop that I visited the
salesman was indeed pushy. Although ‘I‘
tried to explain to him that I wanted to look
for myself for a little while. he would not
leave me alone for more than a few
seconds. To make a long and annoying
episode short. he iinally brought out
something I thought my friend would like-
a necklace.

When I heard the price. I told him I
couldn't afford it. He asked me how much
money I had. I told him (never do this} and
he came to a price that was 30% of the total
amount of money I had with me ($25 in
Israeli Shekels). I hesitated as I wasn’t
sure if it was a reasonable deal for me. He
told me the necklace was sterling and that
i should “either pay the price or don’t buy
it" and he walked away. It seemed a
reasonable price for sterling so I bought it.

Later. I found out from my tour guide
that I‘d been gypped. The necklace was
metal. “You have to he more aggressive”

with respect to the treatment or salespeo»

ple. I was told.

I learned by experience never to smile at
salesmen walking the streets. Other
salesmen in other shops also tried to gyp
me. I wondered why these salesmen pick-
ed on me out of the fiftyrtwo people in our
tour group. I finally discovered that it was
because I acknowledged them by smiling
and saying “hello " As long as I did not

smile and ignored them. they usually left .

me alone.

As for the stcreotypes of lsraeli men and
American women, my first experience
was at a beach in Tel AVlV, On a cool evenr
mg a few people from my group and I were
sitting along the beach wall talking. About
five Israelis walked by. I smiled and said
“hi” to one of these. and the whole group of
them walked over to us They asked us a
few questions about where we were from,
complimented us (with such words as

“beautiful" and “lovely"l and then one of
them asked if I wanted to Come to his
apartment room and have a drink.

“No. thank you,” I said One of the peo-
ple I was with grabbed my arm and said,
“Say goodbye, Janet!” I said “goodbye.’l
Sounding sincere they said. “Bye. Shalom.
Hope you have a nice stay here!" I think
they just considered this kind of behavior
“normal."

However. when I was alone. a waiter, a
hotel desk clerk and an old man of the
streets. three people I at first did not at all
suspect. tried to “pick me up."

At a bus stop I asked an old man the
time. Well. he spoke French better than
English and I had a fun time trying to ex~
press myself in French to him. He asked
some typical acquaintance-learning type
questions and then offered to buy me a
Coke and peanuts.

“No. thank you." I said. I thought it too
nice of him. I thought him extremely nice
until he got on my bus with me. He said he
wanted to, despite my objections.

I thought. “Maybe he just wants to see
me back safely. Geez, but he doesn’t have
to do THIS!" I felt bad. I was scared. too.
though. I got a creepy ieeling as I didn't
even know him and he was doing this.
Why? Iwondered.

Suddenly he became ”handsy" and I
pushed his hands away, I couldn’t believe
it. People stared and laughed. I couldn't
wait to get on the bus. He got oii with me.
despite my many objections.

I told him I had to pack; he couldn’t
come in. Then I found the trick of “getting
rid oi these people": tell them, as I told
this man. that “I'll Write you.” take their
address, give in return a phony address.
say good-bye. and run,

The hotel desk clerk and the waiter were
not “handsy” but wanted “dates“
although I didn't know them. The clerk
even called my room. When I said no as “I
have to pack." he became upset and never
again spoke to me.

The incident with the waiter began when
I innocently asked a waiter at a bar if he
sold any Coke. He took me out by the pool,
I thought he'd show me a Coke machine
the had said. “Here. I'll show you....”)
However. he instead pointed to some men
by the pool, saying. “These are my
friends." He told me to wait and then
brought me a Coke He’d seen me alone in
the hotel dining hall before. he explained. I
remembered I had thought he was good
looking and friendly and I smiled at him.
He called it “love at first sight," When I
looked at him and he at me that’s when he
“knew!" he said. I used the “writing"
trick again to get out oi this one.

Although these experiences seemed to
support the stereotypesiorewarned to me.
I want to stress these are only a few
negative experiences. I did meet helpful
