A GENTLER 53RD DISTRICT?

east. The district’s Democratic pri-
mary is June 5 7 weeks after the
Grinnell semester ends. But Thelin
said he’s still counting on student
support — in the form of absentee
ballots, which students will mail from
home.

Should Andreas secure the Demon
ciatic spot on the ticket, he will go on
to face Republican incumbent Philip
Tyrell in the district election next
November.

The state requires that candidates
reside in Iowa for at least a year
before the election. Andreas, who
has spent four years in Grinnell but
is from Kansas and is spending the
semester in London, seems to be in a
gray area.

“Home is Newton. Kansas, for
me,” Andreas said. “But of course
Iowa is my second home. I really do
feel at home there. And you know, it
was just by a cruel ﬂuke of nature
thatl happened tobebom in Kansas.
I should have been born in District
53."

Is he really serious aboutrunning
for office?

“Oh, I don’t know,” Andreas said.
“Yeah, sure. You bet.”

Thelin admits the campaign he
gan whimsically but says that
whimsy is not unknown in politics.

“There are probably a great many
candidacies that start out as a whim-
sical thing.” Thelin said. “It’s al-
ready gotten much more concrete."

The jury is still out on whether a
twink — as Grinnell students are
sometimes known in these parts 7
can win a townie election. Kevin
Crim, an assistant in the college’s
writing lab and a member of the
county Democratic committeesince
1979, says he’s not sure.

“'I'hat’s hard to tell. Grinnell stu-
dents are intelligent and hard-work-
ing. Those kind of people make
good candidates,” Crim said. “On
the other hand the legislativedistrict
here is a difﬁcult one and there's a
well entrenched Republican encum-
bent. That might be a pretty tough
road."

TheRepublicanencumbent.Philip
Tyrell, is from the town of North
English in neighboring Iowa county.
He is now in his second consecutive
term as legislator for the districL In
the most recent election, in 1988,
Tyrell beat the Democrch oppo-
nent, Mona Bond, by a margin of
2,600 votes — with 7,800 votes to
Bond‘s 5,200.

Tyrell is “really going to he diffi—
cult to budge," Thelin said. “We
reallyneedenthusiasticsupportfrom
the college community. We need
people torally behindJonathan. And
Jonathan's a likeahle guy. He’s easy
to rally behind."

Mona Bond, who’s now Powesh-
iek County supervisor, said she‘s
undecided as to whether she’ll run
again.

Bond urged that Andreas join
forces with local Democratic activ-
ists. If local Democrats can decide
on a single candidate in advance, she
said, they can do away with thelune
primary and save thousands of dol-
lars in campaign funds.

Andreas "needs to sit down and
talk this over, because it’s a real
concentrated effort. It Cost me a little
over $15,000 last time,” Bond said.
“He’s got to have the right contacts
and the right suppon and the right
connections.

Bond said that Andreas‘ chances
will “depend on him. It’ll depend on
his appearance, his personality and
his attitude."

A knotty election issue in District
53 has been local property taxes ~
which a group of voters in Iowa
County wants abolished. “They’re
real, real active," Bond said. Repub-
lican Philip Tyrell is theircandidate.

And whatof the candidate's qualiv
Iications? Andreas said he has never
won an elected office in the Student
Government Association. “But I ran
twice," he said. “Also, I was an S.A.
And I think I’m on the E.P.C. for
American studies, but I’m not sure."

Andreas’ campaign platform
seems to be under formation.

“Maybe my campaign should be:
‘1 need ajoh, keep this man off the
streets. American studies major will
become bum unless elected,” An-
dreas said

“Ifelected, Iwill do my best to do
a good job," Andreas said. “If you
ﬁgure out any local issues, let me
know.”

KNIFING SUSPECT

 

C onlirlued from p. 1

Grinnell police have also inter-
viewed the Grinnell student whom
Ahmad stayed with during his visit
in late October. She agreed to speak
with The Scarlet & Black on the
condition of anonymity.

She said she was called to the
police station after Ahmad‘s depar-
ture from Grinnell.

“I told them what I knew. I’m not
sure if I would have told them that
much, though, hadI known what all
had gone on," she said. She said she
does not know where Ahmad is.

Grinnell students carried Ahmad
back to the student‘sroom following
the fight, badly beaten and uncon»
scious. Asked why she didn’t con-
tact police at that point, the student
replied, “For all I knew, it was just
another bar fight, and people are
usually beaten up in those.”

Sgt. Hanssen said that police
warned the student that it is illegal to
withhold information on the WhEl’Cr
abouts of someone charged with a
felony.

“It was not a threat, just a fact,”
said Hanssen. “I have no reason to
disbelicvc” the Student.

The student told police she does

not know any other first namewhich
Ahmad may go by.

“I just can’t wait until this is all
over," she said. “I think that this
whole thing has been blown out of
proportion."

Sgt. Hanssen said it is impossible
to say when the warrant will be
served. “We’re comfortable in say—
ing that we have the correct person,
but there’snotelling how longitwill
take until we are able to put the
correct name on the warrant,” he
said.
