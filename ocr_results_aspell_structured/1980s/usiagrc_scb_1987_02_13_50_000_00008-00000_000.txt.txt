This month’s foreign film series begins
with the political thriller, Z, the second
film by the controversial director Con-
stantin CostaVGarvas, Based on the novel
of the same name, 2 is the disguised ac-
count of an assassination conspiracy In
Greece in 1963.'The story is set off by the
assassination of a leftist deputy shortly
after he addresses a meeting protesting
the deployment of 11.8. Polaris missiles at
Greek bases. A young magistrate is
assigned to investigate the case on the
assumption that he will not dig too deeply.
Contrary to the intentions of his superiors,
the idealistic investigator uncovers a net
work of fascist corruption in the govern-
ment and police force.

z is action from the opening credits to
the close. CostarGarvas is superb in pro-
viding an exciting thriller that keeps the
viewer on the edge of his seat for the entire
film. Furthermore, he has constructed an
intelligent film. 2 is about the struggle bet
ween idealism and power in modern socie-
ty The film’s location and subject are par-
ticularly salient because of the history of
modern Greece and the U.S. role in it. In
1947 and again 1967 the West feared that
Greece would fall to the Communists. In
the latter case (which is forecast here),
the fascist rigt t seized control. '

L all of Costa-Garvas' films, 2 is
politicially slanted. There are some
stereotypes here but the acting, direction,
and editing are first rate. 2 is a must see.

The Grand Illusion

by Kevin O'Prey

In a triumph of understatement, one of
the clnema’s greatest directors directed
this, one of the cinema’s greatest works, in
1937, Jean Renoir was not only a major in-
fluence on the French New Wave but has
left a legacy that remains today. THE
GRAND ILLUSION, without doubt, is his
finest work.

Set behind German lines during the First
World War, THE GRAND ILLUSION is a
tale of individual confrontation, Rather
than focus on the exploding shells, the
trench life, and the martial music, Renoir
explores a German camp for French
prisoners of war. in this camp the German
commanding officer and the leader of the

by Bruce Emond

In the transition from literary form to
the screen, an author’s message often is
muted and sometimes even destroyed.
Among notable exceptions to this is the
film adaptation of Alan Paton’s CRY, THE
BELOVED COUNTRY which retains the
seething insight and power which
distinguished it as a novel. Paton ranks
among a small group of white South
African writers, including Nadine Gcr~
dimer and the poet Andre Brink, whose
works have denounced the inhumanity of
the apartheid system and called for
change in South African government.

CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRY tells
of a minister (Canada Lee) who ventures
to the city of Johannesburg in search of his
sun. In the city, the minister is befriended
by a black clergyman, played by Sidney

French prisoners hold a relationship of
mutual contempt colored by curious
understanding and respect for one
another. Renoir depicts the attempts by
the prisoners to escape from the war and
the prison camp — both part of the grand
illusion '

Renoir viewed World War II as a water-
shed in European history. it represented
the destruction of the old, ruling—class
dominated order and the ascendancy of
ideas of liberalism and humanism. In THE
GRAND ILLUSION he subtly provides a
timeless critique that still delivers a
powerful message today.

Despite the efforts of Paton and other
South Africans, the inequitable position of
South African blacks has changed
marginally since this film was released
more than three decades ago. CRY, THE

relevant today, and perhaps more so when
we consider what actually has been
achieved in effecting black equality, as it
was when it waspremiered.

Being There

by Brian Strause

It is preposterous to think that the Presi-
dent of the United States would take the
advice of a man who barely knows his own
name. Seriously, what are we inithe Dark
Ages? Is not the President equipped with
perfectly capable and knowledgeable ad-
visors, men of strong educational and
moral backgrounds, with their manicured
fingers on the pulse of the nation? Ap-
parently this scenario is merely wishful
thinking In BEING THERE, starring
Peter Sellers as Chance, the mentally in-
competent gardener.

Chance is willingly confined for over 40
years behind the walls of a stately
Washington home. His days are joyfully
filled by gardening and watching televi-
sion (at least putting him one up on
America’s youth). His knowledge of plants
IS amazing (“In spring, all the plants will
grow”), while his television habits remain
schizophrenic. The home is generously
sprinkled wlth televisions, whose channels
Chance changes at no more than ten-
second intervalsffhe end result of his
viewing habits is a collage of video vomit.

Of course, no one should be able to live
this well. The master of the house dies,
leaving Chance out on the street for the
first time in his life. Luckily, he is hit by a
car that Just happens to be owned by the
wife of the richest man in the world, Ben»
jamin Rand. She takes Chance back to her
mansion where Chance is accepted, partly
due to his own agreeability (most semi»
vegetables are agreeable), and partly on
account of the Rands’ lack of character
scrutiny. While Chance speaks of the imr
portance of root preservation and the
changing of the seasons, the Hands
mistake the content of Chance's simple
observations as profound metaphors for
life.

Benjamin adopts Chance as a guru and
invites him to meet the President at a
meeting concerning the content of an up
coming speech. Chance easily fulfills his
role in the conversation, boggling the
President's mind with simple agricultural
tips. The President, blinded by his own
problems, takes Chance’s words as cosmic
wisdom and subsequently makes a hero
out of Chance by citing his wisdom to the

The Makioka Sisters

THE MAKIOKA SISTERS opens in the
spring of 1933 when the four Makioka
sisters are reunited in Kyoto. The sisters
were raised in the wealthy and comforr
table tradition of an Osakan merchant
family, but Japan is on the brink of World
War II and the status of both their wealth
and social position is shifting.

Tsuruko is the eldest sister and the ex-
ecutor of their father’s fortune. She is mar-
ried to the pragmatic Tatsuo, a banker,
Suchiko lives in the suburbs of Osaka with
Teinosuke, her husband, who works in a
department store. Her two younger
sisters, Yukiko and Taeko, live with them,
Yukiko is beautiful and perfectly bred, an
emblem of classical Japanese Vitrues.
Taeko, rebellious and clad in Western
dress. has established her own career as a
doll maker and has no shortage of suitors,
but she cannot marry until her older sister
does. Yukiko has had a steady stream of
nlllarriage proposals, but she refuses them

Through the direction of Ken Ichikawa,
the film touches on each sister's exc
periences, dreams, fears, and the bonds,
filial and otherwise, that bind them
together. These bonds are strained as the
