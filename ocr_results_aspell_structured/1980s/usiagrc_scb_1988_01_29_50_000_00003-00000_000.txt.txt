it wasn’t hard to guess then that
the group of men standing outside
our tent wearing green army
uniforms were police, We had little
choice but to clamber out of the
tent into the rain to meet floods of
angry Chinese.

They demanded several things,
one of which we understood to be
our student IDs. which we heard
become even angrier as the police
noticed we were students studying
Chinese How could we study at
their piestigious Nanjing Universi-
ty. they demanded. and notunders»
iand what they were saying? They
tinally got their point across to us.
that We‘d broken the law by sleep»
ing out in the counirysidc and were
now sentenced to rifle five hours
back to Nan Dd on our bikes in the
rain Moreover. we had to disman-
tle the tent and tie everything to
our bikes, sloshing through the
huge mud puddle that was once the

. dirt road on which we had come.

In the midst oi our packing. the
police actually took out a camera
and took pictures oi us and our
tent, This made us feel on the one
hand that. We were novelties, or
that they wanted to try out a new
Camera. and on the other hand,
that we were criminals and they
were gathering cvmlence against
us

As we set all. our friends [ruin
the military were kind enough to
iollow us with headlights lighting
up the road ior us. li only they
would have lett them on tor more
than five minutes at a time so that
our eyes could adjust to either light
or darkness! The other
harassments they subjected us to
included honking the horn at us, in-
dlcating they wanted us to stop and
then yelling at us to continue. and

every time we had to make a turn .

in the road, pointing the wrong
direction and then honking and
yelling wildly to get us to go the
right way

When we reached the highway,
we rode quickly, speeding towards
Ninjing to try to get to Nari Da
before 5 A.M, the time the police
promised to stop in and check that
we had ridden straight home and.

replied, ‘That's why we came to
France." Another wrote. “What
about World War ii. you
ingrates’l”

The two world wars. especially
the second, seem less distant in
Nantes than they do in the United
States. From time to time, one
hears a remark about the destrucr
tion American bombers caused
during World War it, but there is
still a generally iavorable impress
sion oi Americans. '

World War 11 leit signiiicani
parts oi Nantes leveled by Allied
bombs. An elderly tour guide
leading oorgroup onahistoric tour
oi Nantes emphasized throughout
his speeches what the iiiiericuii
bombs had destroyed. Given the
amount oi damage their city took
irom American bombs. one might
iliinktheNantaiswould avehiiter
memories oi the Americans It is
iortunaie that the iacts point in the
other direction. in an introduction
to a class in the history oi Nantes.
the proiessor deemphasized the
actual damage oi the bombs and
instead discussed the decreased
Nazi presence.

On a larger scale. atter the war.
Nantes renamed one oi its major
streets aiter Franklin Roosevelt.
presumably in admiration oihis etr
lots in the war Nationally. the
French government is in the pro-
cess oi an organized campaign to
commemorate the 70th anniver~
sary oi the u 3. entry into World
War ll.

Americanism is the result oi the
behavior oi Americans, A striking
example is the diiierent level oi
service Americans receive in
France depending on the
politeness ol' the Americans. In
Nantes, there is a cafe that
Americans trequent. At this Cate,
the owners, waiters, and the iew
French customers constantly
make iun oi the Americans.
although the Americans are not
always aware oi it, The reason that
the French make iun oi the
Americans is that the Americans
lend to speak very loud. obnoxious
English. i went there once. The
owner tried to give me a British
lope-ace instead of the lﬂrFranc
piece that he owed me inr change.

major hills, we decided to try hit-
chhiking again, which proved to be ’
a ditiicult task since the traiiio was
not too abundant or iriendly at o
three in the morning. Finally, 10 ,
kilometers out at Nanjing, we [lags
ged down a truck and threw our
bikes on the back just as it started

Kathy had to sit in the open end oi
the truck, rain pouring down, but
in general we were ecslatic to be so
close to home.

Arrivmg more thana little wet at
Nan Do, we slept uninterrupted by
the police. We went to class the
next morning to find out tram our
teacher. whose husband is a Com-

we had tried to camp in a special
military zone.
