SGA heads leaders new proiecfs

Agenda, explanatory booklet, fund forms among plans

by Ellen Heath

.lohn Moiiet, president of the Student
Government Association (SGA), and Mark
Bradshaw, vice president of SGA, have
developed a few projects this year design-
ed to lessen the problems of understanding
SGA procedure,

Every week, the campus Memo will in-
clude the agenda ior each SGA meeting,
Bradshaw pointed out that this plan was
part oi their election platform and said
regular access to the agenda will let people
“know ahead of time What's going to be
discussed , . . so it they're particularly in-
terested in knowing what the Loose Hall
Ball budget looks like and what the finance
committee has done to it, it can Show up.”

New Funding Applications

A major problem in students' dealings
with SGA, in Bradshaw's opinion, is in re»
questing money irom the tinance commit-
tee and the initiative fund. “The old ap-
plications,” Bradshaw said, “were pretty
vague People would put down what they
thought was a lairly complete presentation
. . and submit their proposal and suddenly
he deluged with questions , . . " The new
application iorms, which Treasurer Vern
Jules is designing, are supposed to ask ior
the specific information the funds commit-
tees will need to know. Bradshaw thinks
the process will be “Very simple."

Booklet Explaining SGA

Another project which Bradshaw in»
itiated is the compilation of a booklet to ex-
plain the structure and procedure of SGA.
Bradshaw said the booklet will contain
“the committee structure, how to go about
getting applications (for SGA funds), . . a

briei description oi how SGA operates in
the whole context of Grinnell . . . and the
way SGA and the faculty and administra
tion all tieein.” He called the projected
pamphlet “a very basic, up-iront guide to
what the SGA does and how it does it.”
SGA officials have not yet determined how
the booklet will be published or how many
will be available Bradshaw said it should
be done by October break.

“1 think the constitution is probably the
least read document on campus." Brad-
shaw responded to a question about the in-
clusion of the SGA constitution in the pam-
phlet, That document is too lengthy ior the
booklet to incorporate. There is a copy of
the constitution in the SGA office and
another copy is on reserve in the library

The booklet will also aid future SGA ofc
ficials. Moffet Commented that one of the
weaknesses of the student government is
that “before you learn your job the year's
half over." The vice president said, “when
we came here we had to . , (practically)
research some of the more obscure com»
mittees that we had to appoint people to."
He hopes the booklet will provide one
source for the officials to look at.

Stepped-back Elections

A iourth plan, which will take place se
cond semester, is to hold the SGA elections
earlier in the year. Moffet and Bradshaw
agreed that once elections were held last
year and a cabinet was appointed there
was little time left to choose members for
U16 various SGA committees. Bradshaw
said he and Moffet interviewed about 100

SGA poses new policy

by Susan Burke

Discussion oi a new policy regarding
security guards for all-campus parties
dominated the new business at WednesV
day's fiist meeting of the Joint Board. The
proposed policy would require that the
organizers of allecampus parties hire a
specific number oi security guards irom a
previously chosen pool.

The main purpose oi these security
guards would be to prevent minors irom
the town of Grinnell from attending College
parties where liquor is being served. This
is necessary because hall presidents. the
purchasers oi the liquor and the servers oi
the liquor, are legally liable ior whatever
happens at the parties they sponsor in the
case at underage people it is possible that
they might, also. be liable for what goes on
aiter the party is over, including accidents
and personal inyuries Having security
guards on duty shows that there was an efe
tort made by the party organizers to
rent any minors irom obtaining liquor
the event of a lawsuit.

The discussion centered on the fact that
die decision was made without cone
sulting the Joint Board, and also that the
hall preSldents would like to choose their
own security people for the sake of
cooperation and trust It was clarified that
the money to pay the security guards
would not come out of hall funds.

Several solutions to the problem of
choosing guards to suit the hall presidents
were brought up, but because the details of
the policy have not been finalized, the only

resolution was to note the proposed ideas
to ask for further study. Jomt Board also
agreed that Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman attend the SGA meeting next
week so further discussion can take place.
place.

Committee reports included the news
that the broken movie projector was still
under warranty and that a brand new pro-
jector should be here for use this weekend.
A charity fund raiser for an undecided
organization in Grinnell was mentioned, as
was the $96.50 raised from the used book
sa e

A unanimous motion was passed to allow
the Student Coordinators Ofﬁce to borrow
5500 from the general budget to be used to
lend to students in amounts of less than
$50, The money ior this use has previously
come from a furniture auction: however
one to a lack oi planning and organization
over the summcr, there is a strong
possibility that there will be no iurniturc
auction this semester.

Election oi iour representatives from
the Jomt Board to various committees was
also completed. Pete Haulzinger was
elected to the Finance Committee, Vic
Rudolph to the Committee on Student Life.
Mike Cameron to the Initiative Fund and
Rafael Stein to the Political Activities Sup-
port Fund.

The action at the meeting dealt with
the possi lity oi changing the policy that
requires RA'S to contact BEzG for any sei‘c
vices.

candidates for committee positions last
spring.

Accordingly, Bradshaw explained that
he and Moffet want to “step the elections
back so that ﬁle cabinet can be put
together beiore spring break, (and) you've
got six weeks after that to do your commit-
tees."

"Problem With Information"

Motiet stated that student committees
are one medium used to facilitate the flow
oi communication between the ad
ministration and students “We've always
had a problem with information," Moiiet
said. “We learn about administrative deci
sions after the iact and everybody gets
upset, but it would be helpiul ii they had
been there beiore And so, what were
basically trying to do is , , . iill ourcommit-
tees on time , (to have members) pre-
sent at committee meetings . . . (to) let us
know beforehand that there is an item
coming up,"

“One or the faculty‘s biggest
complaints,” said Bradshaw, has been
uneven attendance of Students on commit
tees, but this problem may not be so pro
nounced this year. Moffet saw the ilood oi
interest in committees last spring as an in-
dication oi students “wanting some
answers" about administrative and iacul-
ty decisions, It is too early to tell yet, but
Moliett hopes that student enthusiasm and
curiousity will continue this semester.

Book sale grosses $2,000

by Kim MacDonald

If the Used Book Sale is any indicator of
success, the Student Coordinators Office
should have a good year

At last Saturday’s Used Book Sale, some
$2,000 worth of books changed hands in
comparision to the $500 tally last semester,
Student Coordinator Jon Scharff at-
tributed the increased sales to the fact that
the event was held the first Week of the
semester

Last semester's sale, however, was dur
ing the third week of the semester, after
most students had already purchased their
books, with five percent of each sale going
to SGA. the Student Coordinators Office
made a proiit oi approximately $97, “the
most we've made in a couple of years," ac-
cording to Scharii

AS student coordinator. Scharff is in
charge of the service branch of the Student
Government Association (SGAD. His office
sponsors a myriad or services, events, fun»
draising activities, and general public ser-
vice proiects. The biannual blood drive,
reirigerator rentals, and the Waltz are one
ly a few examples of their activities.

it is almost inevitable that an olilce
which provides student services would be
the butt of some complaints. Two years
ago. Anna Marie Campbell resigned irom
the position of head coordlnator in mid-
.V‘ovembcr, after describing the job as
"like being in a pressure cooker.“

Schartt teels there is a lot oi apnthy‘

towards son, but he feels his oitice is “a
good institution tor the campus." He ex
plained, "I like working and organizing ac
mines that students eniov.”

New plans include the possibility oi a
carnival to benefit a town organization.
Scharii hopes that each dorm W|ll run a
booth in the early November event He
would like to get a “dunk tank," a popular
carnival game in which patrons pay to
throw balls at a device which, it hit, drops
a person into a tank full of water, Most
small towns get their local oiiicials to sit in
the dunk chair but Scharif would like to get
faculty. administration and student
volunteers. '

in addition to the Friday night iowa City
Shuttle, they will run a second shuttle to
McDonald’s in Newton, Among the usual.
social events, the Student Coordinators Ofc
iice will sponsor the Square Dance on Sept
25 and the Waltz in late November.

One aspect oi the ethos which many
students are unaware is the role that the
student coordlnator plays in mediating
disputes Scharii described the office as a
sort of a “Better Business Bureau“ Where
students can take complaints and prop
blems they have with iaculty, administl'ae
tion or anything else they may be having
diiiiculty \vith Forms ior complaints can
be obtained in the SGA office, and Scharii
noted that they had already had one com-
plaint. “It‘s a liason between the ad-
ministration and the bureaucracy.“ accor-
ding to Scharii,

other members oi the Student Coore
dinators otiicc include Cathy Zimmere
man, Tracey Wold. Kurt Brobst and John
Egan. who all serve as assistant coon
dinators.
