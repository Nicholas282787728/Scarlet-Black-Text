Runners Pack
Up for State

By Dave Jones

Coming oii an impressive seeondplace
finish in the Beloit Invitational, the men’s
Cross counlry team’ seems to have an ex
cellent shot at capturing the conference ti~
tie this year

Sophomore Greg Evans led Grinnell‘s
attack by posting a time of 27:42, good [or
third place. But coach Will Freeman is
quick to point out that the whole team is

. important. “Only seven oi them can score
points, but they can all contribute,” he
adds.

Going into the invitational, Freeman's
only goal for the tam was to work on their
packing technique. He reels that it was
very much a success as only ten seconds
separated the team‘s numbers two
through seven runners. This closeness in
times indicates that there is much com~
petition within the team, which Freeman
thinks is very useiul “It’s the naive person
who thinks that there's not competition on
a team," he stresses, adding that this come
petition is healthy as the runners push
each other to do their best.

Despite the early success, Freeman is
not sitting back and relaxing by any
means. “I don't‘think any coach is ever
Satisfied that it is perfect. I don't think
they're even close to what they can be ”

Rather than keying on the upcoming
meet this weekend, Grinnell women hare
riers picked last weekend's invitational as
a larget meet, Unfortunately, that was
before they realized they'd be racing
without three of their top five runners.

Grinnell finished em 0f 11 teams, Conti-
nuing to run in line iorm, Jennifer Bishop
was the individual winner, completing the
2‘2 mile course in 15:41, Shavaun Adams
was sixth with 16:26e

Rounding out the scorers for Grinnell
were Ingrid Hutter (46th), Beth Powers
(48th) and Mary Lanaghan (58th).

“We obviously didn't do as well in scorn
ing as we would have liked,” noted Coach
Evelyn Freeman, “But a lot of that was
because we were missing three top run-
ners."

The meet was not without its bright
spots, though. According to Freeman, “We
were able to see a lot of the competition we
haven’t seen before ~ particularly some of
our conierence opponents in the North
Division." She added, “We saw that
ﬂ'iey’re not unbeatable, and lf we're
healthy and all of our top runners race, we
should do well against them"

While the State meet this weekend isn't a
key one for the women, Freeman noted
that me team would still like to do Well.
“We may want to make up ior last

weekend.” she stated, ‘

Overall. coach John Pfitsch is pleased
with the performance of his soccer team.
“The team is over the hump mentally; the
players ieel good about themselves which
will enable us to win more games."

W|th two shutouLs in their last two
games ~ 270 over Monmouth and downing
Knox 3-0 v the Pioneers truly appear to
have settled into a winning groove The
47371 Pioneers are beginning to come into
their own, Starting to win as a team, At 3-0
in conference with only two conference
games remaining, the team stands a good
chance oi achieving their iirst goal oi a
conierence championship.

These victories mark a reversal from a
rather slow start. According to Pfitsch.
lack oi organization hindered the beginnr
ing of their season, as they only managed a
loss and a tie in the opening tournament.
The squad, composed of many talented
ireshmen, simply wasn't ready and it
psychologically set back the veteran
players

Uniortuantely, the problems didn’t quite
stop here. For Ffitsch, this team has 5us
iered the most injuries oi any other team
he ever has coached. The loss of key

players to injuries and bouts with the ilu,
along with rather rotten iield conditions,
didn't exaclly help the team's perfor-
mance.

But the players have bounced back and
gotten back onto the winning track. They .
have put everything together and are look»
ing Smooth on the field Pfitsch was
especially pleased with the perinrmance oi
his keeper, Randy “George” Seeley. who
turned in a fine show blanking Knox Ac-
cording to Seeley, who doesn't remember
too much aiter suiierlng a concussion
against Monmouth, ”Either our
defense or our oiiense has played well, and
it we can put them together, we’ll be tough
to beat.”

They will have to demonstrate this quali-
ty play this weekend. with a tournament
here against nationallyrranked Wooster
and St, Mary’s. For the everrmodest K J.
Noll, who had two goals and two assists in
the last two games. “I played greatl The
team is also playing well overall, so the
tournament should be to our advantage."
According to Plitsch. “We'll have some
real fun out there and hopeiully upset
somebody."
