Purple Roos one hop
away from nationals

by Peter Nassiff

Senior Greg Evans led
Grinnell’s valiant Purple Roos to
their third consecutive champi-
onship in the men‘s cross country
Conference Meet last Saturday at
cold and rainy Beloit. Evans
claimed his third consecutive
championship. becoming only
the fourth runner in the history of
the conference to do so.

The intrepid Roos slogged
their way through the mud,
pushing back Cornell to second
place for the third consecutive
year. They were not, however,
running all out According to
coach Will Freeman, “They were
really only running well enough
to win. The big test will be at
regionals." Indeed, the team, cur-
rently ranked twentieth in the na-
tion, foresaw that the conference
would not offer any great chal-
lenge. In lieu of peaking for the
Conference Meet, the high hop-
ping Roos trained through it in
preparation for a peak at the Re-
gional Meet this Saturday. The
top four teams in the region will
advance to nationals: Grinnell is
ranked fourth in the region,

Evans handily won his
third individual conference chamr
pionship. I-Ie waited behind arch
rival Jeff Maples of Cornell until
the fourth mile, when he ﬂew
past and ran away to finish in
26: 14, twelve seconds ahead of
Maples. Running second for the
Roos was freshman Dave Peter-
son, who shocked the conference
with his dazzling coiffure and his
eighth place finish in 27:23.
Peterson was followed by
sophomore David Hammond,
who came in tenth in 27:28. In»

27:36, ran fourth for the Roos

followed by sophomore Todd
Rowekamp. whose 27:40 earned
him fourteenth; freshman Jason
Maples. who came in fifteenth in
27:49; sophomore Pat Heller,
seventeenth in 27:55; and fresh-
man Guy Potter, who rounded
out Grinnell's squad in 28:20 for
twentieth place. The top ﬁfteen

Roos‘ talent and depth were fur-
ther evinced by the fact that Pot-
ter, eighth on the turn. beat the
fourth men from every other
school in the conference.

All in all, the meet served
as an excellent tune up for the
Regional Meet. The Roos are
ready to make their bid to become
the first Grinnell team ever to
qualify for nationals.

Believe it or not, Grinnell
does have a fencing team. What's
more, its members aren't doing
half bad.

Last weekend, .leff Wilson
took third place in a novice tour-
nament at the University of Iowa.
There were approximately 40
fencers there and about 15
schools or clubs represented.
This was Jeff's first competition.
He started fencing this year.

Alan Nichols made it to the
ﬁnals as well, placing 4th. Joe

Freshman
Thorburn
wins crown
at Beloit

Last Saturday was a cold,
misty and windy day in Beloit,
Wisconsin, but the Grinnell
women's cross country heated up
to challenge rival Cornell for the
Midwest Conference champi—
onship. While the Rams did es-
cape with a 64-70 victory,
Christine Thorburn won the
individual crown for the Pioneers.

Thorbum will load the
squad into tomorrow‘s NCAA re-
gional meet hosted by Wartburg.

The freshman will be running in '

quest of a berth at the national
meet, Coach Evelyn Freeman
predicts that Thorburn has a
strong chance to qualify. Free-
man was pleased with the team's
performance, noting, "We ran
hard and everyone ran well." She
added that Cornell had a solid
team performance.

Joanne Sackett placed third
while Heidi Freiburger was ninth,
both runners earning all-confer-
ence status. Sackett has an out-
side chance to qualify for nation-
als.

Freeman was also pleased
with Susie Petheram's effort Sat-
urday. After being ill for a num»
ber of weeks, the sophomore ran
a "tough race," placing 23rd.

The coach can look foward

to the future as her team will lose
only one senior, captain Ashley
Abel. Furthermore. there were
also three strong runners who
were forced to by-pass the race
altogether due to injuries.

This season the pioneers
were fourth in the conference,
their worst ﬁnish ever, but Free—
man has brought the team back.
In her nine year tenure, Freeman's
teams have won three conference
crowns, and have finished second
five times.

Pioneers crushed at
Illinois College 22-0

by Patrick Eppler
Grinnell closed out their
1988 football campaign this past
Saturday with a 22-0 loss to Illi-
nois College. It was the Blue
Boys first win against Grinnell
since the series began in 1981i
The Pioneers had trouble
generating any sort of offense
against a ﬁred up Illinois College
team, which meant the defense
was on the field for a good pore
Lion of the game. "We were terr
rible" said junior offensive tackle
Scott Whipple in summing up
Grinnell's effort.
The Pioneers were held to

‘ 172 yards of total offense, only

66 of which came on the ground.
Senior fullback Paul Mantemach
rushed for 41 of those yards on
nine carries. Quarterback‘lim
Weiand completed 13 of 30
passes for 106 yards. Two
turnovers and two fourth down
failures at midﬁeld contributed to
Grinnell's offensive woes.

While the numbers may
not indicate so, Grinnell's defense
played fairly well, considering
that they were on the field for
almost two thirds of the game.
Illinois College did end up with
336 total yards, but the Pioneers
held the Blue Boys to two touch»
downs, and did not give up any
big plays. Illinois College tal—
lied nine of their poian on Tony
Fox field goals. Wallace Squibb
and Mike Anderson anchored the

defense, combining for seven
solo tackles and 15 assists.

For the season, Grinnell
finished at 2-6, after coming out
of the blocks at 271. First year
coach Greg Wallace called the
year "disappointing" as he feels
that the Pioneers were a .500
caliber learn. Offensive stalwarts
for Grinnell were senior co-cap—
tians Manternach and Weiand.
Mantcrnach rushed for 762 yards
on 186 carries for the year, aver-
aging four yards a pop. Weiand
completed 70 of 155 passes.

with 36 solo tackles and 73 as-
sists, while Squibb finished with
15' solos and 61 assists.

The future of Grinnell
football looks bright as 36 play-
ers, including 14 starters. will
return next year from this year's
squad of 48‘ With the comple-
tion of the season, coach Wallace
will focus on recruitingr "We
have to enroll about 25 freshmen
again. We're up against some
schools with 90 players on their
rosters", commented Wallace. As
numbers increase, and Wallace‘s
schemes become more ingrained
into the program, the fortunes of
Grinnell football should continue
to improve.

finishes

miserable season
with rare victory

by George Mel imsey

Any fan of sports literature
who might have read the story of
Indiana Basketball's, Search on
the Brink. might be tempted to
draw a parallel between the frus-
trations that team experienced and
those which the 1988 Pioneer
women's volleyball team faced (if
you haven't read it you probably
get the idea) As far as records
go, the Pioneer's 3-27 mark cer-
tainly seems to indicate a season
spent on the brink of disaster or,
worse yet, a season that fell off
that brink.

Call me the eternal
optimist but, while the team had
their share of problems, many of
which were never resolved. a
more accurate assesment of their
season would be one spent on the
brink of success. While they
never really managed to jump'
that final hurdle of consistency.
the learn did return from the con-
ference tournament with a win
over Illinois College. Gotta love
that!

The team finished I~3 at
the tournament and walked away
with a tenth place finish. They
felt to Beloit, Ripon, and Coe
but showed no mercy with IC,

Clubbing them 15-13, 15-5. "It
was a great way to end the sea
son," coach Sheila Cain sai , "
we almost beat Beloit, the winner
of our pool, and played very well
in all our matches."

So now the season is over.
Though the Pioneeet‘s didn't win
too many games those of you
who managed to saunter over to
the PEC to watch a few certainly
noticed they played some good
volleyballi From a team which
at the beginning couldn‘t get
basic ﬂoor rotations right they
developed into a group which
played tough, hustling defense
with a strong hitting attack.
Lack of consistency did indeed
plague them, but the
developments which were made
under ﬁrstayear coach Cain have
Pioneer volleyball on the right
track. all the more closer to
crossing the brink to a winning
season. The team loses two
seniors, Melissa Fitzpatrick and
Donna Gleason, who will both

be sorely missed will but return
three juniors, three sophomores.
and seven freshmen.
