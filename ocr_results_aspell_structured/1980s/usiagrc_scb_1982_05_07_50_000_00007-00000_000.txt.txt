of Assistant Coach Henry Zayas on die
Grinnell women‘s soccer team. The ac»
curacy or one remark becomes apparent
upon review of the women‘s soccer team's
short history. Only two years old, the team
has managed to grow from a sparcely

competitively active and well-stocked
team. At the Spring Invitational Tourna-
ment, which Grinnell hosted for the first
time three weeks ago. Grinnell entered
two teams which won second and third
places among the five competing teams.

this year, Coach Laura Sinai and Assistant
Coach Rett Britt agree that there is a
greater depth to the team stemming from
the added high school experience of the
freshmen women and the continued par
ticipation oi a low oi last year's par
ticipants. This year, greater depth and
higher quality aiiord the team more pot/ens
