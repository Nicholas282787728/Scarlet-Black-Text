Deceptive practice in suppository ads?

The recent dramatic increase in
nonprescription vaginal contraceptive
use has raised concerns about the
advertising and labeling of these proV
ducts.

Changing consumer contraceptive
practices are the main reasons [or this
growing consciousness, Industry,
government. and consumer represen-
tatives say that the use of the pill has
steadily declined over the last three
years, giving way to other methods of
birth control Une pharmaceutical
trade publication reported last month
that sales in devices other than the pill
and the intrauterine device (IUD) ins
creased 26 percent last year
SpeCiIically, Drug Topics magazine
found that sales of vaginal sup»
positories and foams increased 20 and
19 percent, respectively. Sales or
jellies increased 17 percent.

But three George Washington Univer-
sity students in Washington, Dc, feel
there is a sccond factor contributing to
the increased interest in vaginal cone
traceptives

”Advertising for these products, vii:
tually non-existent three years ago in
commercial print. presently appears
in numerous publications aimed
towards women," say the three
Students for the Examination of Con-
traceptive Effectiveness tSEXCEl.
“The influence of this advertising is
clear: Sales of oversthescounter
vaginal contraceptives are rismg at a
dramatic rate."

This advertising has also hit the cats
legiate press. EatonrMerz Labratories,
inc., for example, has ior two years
run fall newspaper ad campaigns ior
its Encare suppository. Last October
and November's campaign reportedly
covered loo campus papers and a na-
tional collegiate magazine at a total
cost of $90,000.

In general, SEXCE feels the adver-
tising of the $35 million vaginal con-
traceptive industry has been “false
and deceptive.” And just as the Eaton-
Mcrz Encare suppository is currently
leading sales in the field of about Six
such products, “They‘re the worst" in
terms of advertising too, claims sax.
CE member Kevin Zecse,

When it introduced the product as
Encare Oval in i977, Eaton-Merl said
in medical ads that “In a recent West
Germany survey or 237 physicians
prescribing Encare Oval, only 43
pregnancies were reported after 10,017
women completed 53,759 months oi
use. This represents a pregnancy rate
of approximately one per ton woman-
years, It should be noted, however,
that surveys oi contraceptive effec
tiveness vary substantially based on
compliance and characteristics of the
study group "

This statement was quickly inter»
preted as a claim of 99-percent effec-
Iiveness. As Drug Topics itself wrote
in November of 1577: “Studies in Ger-

Febioriry a, load

many, where the product has heen
available for five years, indicate the
product’s reliabilityAapproximatcly
one out oi iiit) women using the sup
pository for 12 months might become
pregnant.” And Playboy wrote iive
months later that “the method is 99
percent effective."

After the Food and Drug Administrar
tion questioned both the advertised
claim and the German studies on
which it was based. EatonsMerz
discontinued use of this effectiveness
statement. But SEXCE still finds fault
with the company’s advertising, in-
cluding last fall’s, In fact, SEXCE fil~
ed complaints with the federal govern
ment against the ads for Encare and
three competitors mko ioam,
Korumex. and Semicid suppository.

SEXCE claims that Encare's Claims
of simplicity in comparison with other
vaginal contraceptives and of safety in
comparison with the pill and IUD ig-
nore the more important aspect of the
product's effectiveness, Ruth Har-
thoorn, SEXCE member, points out
that while Encare may not in itself
harm a woman’s body like the pill or
IUD might, it has yet to be proven as
effective as the pill, and ”an unwanted
pregnancy could harm a woman’s
body or mental attitude due to die use
of a lessseffective contraceptivei '

There’s

better than

sending food

to combat

world hunger.

Finally, SEXCE would like Eatons
Merz to be required to do corrective
advertising because of its original
claim or a “pregnancy rate of approx»
imately one per 100 woman-years?
and its subsequent interpretation as
being a 99-percent effectiveness
rating.

The most recent Encare ad contains
a paragraph in small print pointing
out the importance of reading package
directions. consulting a physician it
necessary. and realizing uiat “no
birth control method is guaranteed to
prevent pregnancy," Tom Julia likes
this to some extent: “This is the kind
of thing that we had recommended."
However, the emphasis on simplicity
and the advertised effectiveness claim
of previous years outweight this im~
provement. “I think more
than anyone else, Eneare should be
obligated to do some corrective adver-
tising." says Julia. But he admits that
it‘s a slim possibility,

Efforts to iurther regulate the ins
dustry's advertising and labeling are
underway. The Federal Trade Com-
mission is completing a non-public in-
vestigation of the industry’s advertis-
ing practices. And the long-awaited
FDA proposal on the products' labelr
ing classifications on safety and effecs
tiveness will soon be published.
