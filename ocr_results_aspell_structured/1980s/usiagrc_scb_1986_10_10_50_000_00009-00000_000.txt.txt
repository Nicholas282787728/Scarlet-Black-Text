Absence of Malice

By Bruce James Emond

In “Absence of Malice." an up and com-
ing reporter (Sally Field) iinds a potential
expose on the inner workings oi the Mafia.
This could be the break which launches her
into the upper echelons oi jounalism. a la
Watergate and Woodward and Bernstein,
Only trouble is, she's gone and fallen in
love with the son (Paul Newman) of none
other than the mafia boss. What‘s she to
do? Forsake love in the name of jour-
nalistic ethics, or does love rally conquer
all (including career ambitions). Such are
me dilemmas of life and love, Hollywood»
style. This is a good him, but be warned:
the viewer really has to like Sally Field‘s
continually pained iacial expressions

. (seemingly EVERYTHING is a tragedy)

Mommie Dearest

By Kate Worster

“Mommie Dearest" is the film version
of Christina Crawford’s book about her
hellish relationship with her mother. Joan
Crawford. It is unfortunate that the film
fails to provide a complete representation
of the book or a comprehensive picture oi
the mother's and daughter's lives.

Faye Dunnaway plays Joan Crawiord,
The Make-up is very good, and Dunnaway
does look quite a bit like Joan. But. it is un~
fortunate that the script is not good and
Crawford is portrayed as a one
dimensional character, a bitch. Christina,
even. is fairer to her mother in the book.
The only acting we see Joan do is her
ridiculous stint on a soap opera. Joan
Crawford did make some good ﬁlms, in
cluding “Mildred Pierce.” The tilm does
provide a brief glimpse oi Joan's problems
with alcohol, but it gives nothing substan-
tial about her own horrible childhood and
her other psychological problems.

This film does justice to neither Joan nor
Christina, it ignores an important facet of
Joan Crawford's life. the fact that in her
later years she could not distinguish her
movie roles from her real life,

Goodbye, Columbus

By Bruce Emond

in “Goodbye Columbus," adapted from
Philip Roth’s novella, a wealthy,
pampered young woman has to choose bet-
ween marrying a popular, “in" man. thus
destined for a life of financial security, or
eloping with the poor. lower closs man she
really loves, Ali MacGraw is perfectly cast
as the self»centered and immature young
woman (playing to the hilt the
stereotypical character later to be dubbed
a JAP). Though Richard Benjamin is in-
teresting in an understated way, any love
relationship, except as rebellion on
MacGraw's part, seems implausible.
There are a couple of scenes 7 dinner at
the MacGraw home, Benjamin playing
ping pong with MacGraw's fiercely com-
petitive younger sister 7 which are
hilarious, Go see ”Goodbye Columbus" if
only for them.
