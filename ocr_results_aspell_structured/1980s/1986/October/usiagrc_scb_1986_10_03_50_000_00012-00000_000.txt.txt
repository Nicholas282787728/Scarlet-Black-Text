Gimme your bestl Hey, I'm waitin'l Is
that all hot air I'm hearing?!”

‘ t. Zack was large and rotund, but decepr
lively quick. in seconds. Jerry was tied in
knots, The rest of the fellas on the team
burst out With catcalls, guffaws. and seat-
lercd applause. Spirits were ligh; they
had won tonight.

Z'ack released his captive otter rapping
his knuckles hard on the man's skill] for
good measure. Jerry griniaced. rubbed his
head as ii soothing the pain, then suddenly
brightened and smiled big lie punched the
big man on the shoulder Lind the two of
them iollowed the others into the adjoining
bar.

It was the last night Zack would bowl
with the guys, it was Captain Lewis who
linally pulled him aside the day before his
retirement dinner zintl told him in the
privacy oi the deserted brieiing room that
he wouldn't be able to bowl for the team
anymore alter his rciireinent. Zack punch-
ed him in the nose, The captain let him ott’
the book.

Zack shuffled into the kitchen, over to
the four-burner gas stove and put the ketr
lie on to boil, He turned and opened the
refrigerator. The Coke bottles on the door
clinked together He bent and retrieved the
tin cream server

The chair scraped harshly across the
linoleum as Zack pulled it from under the
formica-topped table and sat. He suddenly

. lclt old and tired, “Maybe it was good they
forced me to retire,” he thought, The
teapot shrilled its discomfort until Zack
walked to the stove and lifted it off of the
blue flame The teapot wiiined lower. Zack
flicked the gass off and poured the steam-
ing water onto the tiny mound of decaf-
feinated instant coffee lying in the bottom
or the cup.

At the table again, he stirred in some
cold cream. tapped the spoon on the edge
or the mug, and set it down gently. With his
left elbow on the table, he rested his
cheeck against the flat of his hailed fist,
The cup sat untouched.

Zack stared without blinking at the rise
ing tendrils of vapor clinging to the surface
of the cooling coffee. He stayed that way a
long time.

The 18, 19. and 20-year-oids seem to him to
he more mature than when he was that
age. Their expressed interest in wine has
shown that they are “picking up alcoholic
beverages that are maybe a little bit less
dangerous and a little bit more conducive
to having a good time in 2| more restrained
way." The higher drinking age will aiiect
his business. because a lot more people
“won't have the right to come in.”

Phelps is not too worried. however The
idea of fine wine is so new to the area. and
even to the state. that business will in»
crease no matter who is buying.

Tray:

MEAL‘”

Actually, trays do not confirm their ex-
istence merely by being used tor canvas,
There is evidence that they are being
marketed lsee “Solar Tray tm," “Stereo
Ti'ayatm.” and the “NCAA Tray tm, of»
iiciai size and weight"). And besides,
”Cyclists are eating these trays tor a high
fiber diet," Don't listen to anyone who says
“icksnay on the aytray”, but ”Support
.Tray Rights." For evidence of this, one
has only to see the “I'm Proud to be a
Tray” tray or go to the “Tray Resource
Center ” AS per the Grinnell College Com-
puter Services, there is a “mem. tray” out
there somewhere, probably created rrom
an rno, tray.

There are some interesting political sen-
timents on Grinnell trays; among them
“anarchy now!” (repeated many times),
“death to fascism", “deathmongers of the
world unite to destroy,” “US. ' out of
Nicaragua and everywhere else," “Make
Trays Not War," and (this ought to cover
everybody) “Nuke the gay, Palestinian,
Zionist, Nazi, leftist whales for Christ!”

A nice warm greeting {or out-of»state
ireshmen or prospectives is “Welcome to
luwa,” where you can “Surf Iowa Naked."
Or, for a vacation, you could “Ski Siberia"
or “Surf Nicaragua.” (The preceding

from page 5

trays have been brought to you by the
“support your local travel agent” tray.)
Getting back to Grinnell. though, you can
discover ”proof oi prehistoric liie in
Cowles." complete with fossils, or take the
“Prchem exam from Hell." Don’t try to
“outlaw witty banter" lunless you aren't
good at it), and no, it is NOT true that “fun
is outlawed” here. You can write
“something proiound yet witty,” ilike
“Convivmlity breeds contempt") “drag
yoursclr to work” while remaining “up~
wardly mobile at Grinnell.” li you want to
iind out whether you should eat the iood or
not. try the “aura TRAY", complete
with diagram of “YES. EAT IT and N0,
DON'T EAT IT.” And it you ieit your
mother at home, you can always look with
comiort on the tray that yells “HEY! you

HAVEN'T FINISHED! ” ‘

These requirements would allow the col-
lege to admit greater numbers oi
li-eshmeii than ever. say 1000. To pick the
best and the brightest of these we should
just send applications to every one with a
1400 minimum composite SAT score with a
check tor $500$ent to those that apply, This
would probably cost the college less than it
currently spends on admissions il sent in a
plain brown. envelope lwith the new logo
stamped on it. or course).

From the 10,000 or so applicants we
could admit them all. Alter they hear
about the new rules (as above) only about

1000 should be leit to apply.
Now i know most of you out there would '

disagree with these rules. You probably cl»
ing seliishly to the idea that you should
receive a college education. Just
remember that the future of Grinnell is at
stake. Remember that better students
make a better college and some day you'll
be able to say with pride to your grand-
children, “I ilunked out oi the best school
in the whole world” as you eat your can oi

Rab sees Benazir's campaign as one
fueled by a need to avenge her father's exp
ecution, And, like Jooma, Rab said that
Benazir has overestimated her support.

“You see all the crowds when she came
