An
Important
Opening ‘

Tomorrow the Human Resource
Center will open and offer Grinnell
College a unique and valuable service.
Grinnell College has been long in need
of such a facility to educate Grin»
nellians and to help dispell prejudice.
Although manifestations of prejudice
may not be as blatant on the campus
as that which occurs outside. pres
udtce exists in many forms within
and around all of us. The Human
Resource Center will offer a place for
all people to explore their own opi-
nions and to reconsider their pre-
’udices. It is important to recognize
that the Resource Center is designed
to serve all members of the campus
community and is not limited to
specific individuals or established
_roups. The individuals involved in
the creation of the Center should be
commended for their effort to serve
the needs of the entire campus and it
is hoped that the community will res-
iond. From the creation of the center,
we will all reap the benefits ofa more
enlightened and accepting environ
ment.

To the Editor-

AS a Concerned reader of the Scarlet and

mellts about the cditorial page. l am unr
sure or its purpose in the paper and at thc
standards by which thc essayists are yudg

are out of luck I am a tallhlul redder Ol’

Besides the rather mane tltle. Mr,
Munley s subject matter {and gray mar
tcri leave a bit to be desired. Where does
he get his Ideas lor hls columns? Where
docs he get his lacls‘? in order to concenr
trate on the good news at the world, Mr.
Munley holds up the U.S. Constitution as a
happy part at American society. Perhaps

he has lorgotten that this document was
Virltlcn when our country was experienc»

tulnly did not write this document when
they were happy. Mr. Munley then goes on

arguable, l haiic trouble believing that
"’I‘hc privtlege to hitch both in private and
