Studying in China

U ' 'ty
Life
by Can ‘l'ang

It was six years ago when I entered Pek-
ing University with all my imagination
about the campus and ambition of being a
good student. My major there was com-
puter science and it was determined when
I was accepted.

Standing in front of the Computer
Science Department table, I again recall-
ed the congratulations from my high
school teachers and friends. They all
believed that I was lucky In I950, the ma-
jority of Chinese people knew nothing
about computers, even die word “come
puter” itself. A few people mentioned
“computers" or ”software" in their
speeches, and gained respect just as pcole
who could talk about steam boats did in
Mark Twain’s era. When I received admiSA
sion to Peking University, it was also the
first time for me to meet the word ”com-
puter". It sounds impossible, but it was
true. All my choices in the application
form had nothing to do with computers.
They just “put" me in the “lucky" place,

I did not feel happy about my future _

which was supposed to be connected widi
computers, because my favorite class in
high school was physics. I enjoyed coping
with the puzzles which need more imagina-
tion of space than math, I hated math. But
,from now on, I had to “live” with math
every day. ‘

People poured a lot of ﬂattering words
on computers, such as promising, brand
new, fashionable, modern, significant, etc.
I could not avoid being pleased by the come
pliments. Except for accepting the admis-
sion, my only other choice was to return
home and wait for a job. But I would not do
that because I knew that would hurt my
parents and teachers who had so many
hopes for me, Sometimes one cannot just
belong to oneself, In both conscious and un~
conscious worlds, I think my life is for the
people I love and the people who love me.
Their happiness means a lot to me. So,
when i came up to the table, 1 was ready to
try to love computers.

However, i felt sorry for a close friend of
mine. Her talent in acting and writing left
such a deep impression on me that we later
became best friends. She had to follow her
father’s wishes to major in science.

Her father was a typical Chinese, kind
and cautious, He was hurt during the
Cultural Revolution (1966-1976). From his
painful experience. he learned that work»
ing in the fields of science was safer (just
safer) than in social science (he himself
was a history teacher in my high school).
Although in 1980 the nightmare had
already become the past and the star of
hope was rising above her father, like
many other Chinese petiole was not sure
whether the same thing would happen
again. They thought that the most impor-
tant thing was keeping as far away as
possible from anything which had
something to do with politics,

Thus, my friend went to a threevyear col-
lege and majored in chemistry. Satisfied
with her C average, she got married soon
after her graduation. Now she has a lovely
daughter. However, she is no longer the
person I once knew.

Six years ago, i did not expect such an
end to her story. Looking at the only things
I got on regisuation dayda campus map
and a school badge, my only thought was
how good it would be if she were here. We
would explore every corner of the campus,
and lavish praise on each other's “master

piece" writings as we did before, When I _

began to write her, i realized that it was a
real pleasure to write an old friend
especially when one was in a new environ-
ment.

Dorm Life

1 had five roommates'an‘d we shared a
12 square meter room.’l‘he roomwas cram»
med up with three bunk-beds, two desks,
six stools, two bookshelves and the six of
us. We had nothing to complain about since
some of the male students were worse off
than us, They had two more people in
about a 14 square meter room.

To save space, we sat on the beds instead
of the stools as we studied, and our suite
cases were placed under the beds. So
every time we needed something in them,
there was really big movement.

First we asked whoever was studying at
the table and sitting on the bed, “Would
you please move over for a while?" Se-
cond, we moved the table away from the
bed that we had to work at. Third, we drew
out the suitcases that were not the ones we
Wanted but were in our way in order to get
the right one, At last, sometimes we had to
use tools to reach the case which was too
far under the bed. The popular tool was an '
umbrella. When an umbrella was not
available, a broom was a good substitute.
The only time we used stools was when
there was an outdoor movie or a whole

Chinese Education:

The First

by May~lee Chai

Freshman Chi Zhang knows a lot about
the differences between the American and
Chinese education systems. No he has not
studied ﬂiese differences formally, but had
to discover them the hard way when he
moved from China to the United States five
years ago

First of all, Zhang noted in China, most
children start their elementary education
at the age or 6 or 7, compared with
Americans, who start at age 5 “How much
is taught [at so young an age] I am not
sure,” Zhang said.

Chinese elementary school lasts five
years. Students are required to take
Chinese, math, gym. art (drawing),
natural science, Chinese history, music,
English, and social studies. A Chinese
elementary school diploma is equivalent to
the diploma of eighth graders in the us.
Zhang emphasized that this is not a glaring
example of the inadequacies of the US
education system, but an example of dif~
ferences in nomenclature. American
eighth graders and Chinese elementary
school grads are about the same age

(127130. ‘
Zhang does not feel that due to the com-

plex nature of the Chinese language (there
is no alphabet; each new Word is a new
character) elementary school in China is
essentially harder than in America, He
estimates that students learn between
limo-3000 characters during those first five
years of study, depending on the ability
and determination of the student,

(For reference, first year Chinese
students in Grinnell learn 4507500
characters. One must know 3000
characters in order to read a Chin'ese
newspaper, while Americans need to
recognize only 800 words to read an
average US newspaper.)

However, Zhang does note that one
fourth of all children in the Countryside are
illiterate. This is a fact, he said, reported
on the PBS series on China “The Heart of
the Dragon" and confirmed when Zhang
spoke to a Chinese college professor when
he returned to China last year

Zhang feels the emphasis in elementary
school is on learning new vocabulary 7
“strict memorization" 7 and
mathematics,

“That, in my opinion, may be one of the
reasons why Chinese are ‘good in math',”
he said

One striking difference with American
schools is that most elementary schools in
China require students to study a foreign
language, starting in the third grade.
However, once one enters high school, the
whole language is usually re taught from
the beginning, he said

Chinese place much more importance on
studying and schoolwork than do
Americans, Zhang cites several reasons
for this. One is that Chinese students have
a sixday school week, leaving only one
day for free time, and so they do not have
much time to develop outside interests
that would detract from studying,

Secondly, because of the enormous
population of China the percentage of
students who may attend college is
necessarily quite limited, Acceptance into
a Chinese university is based solely on the
results of a standardized national test.

“If you pass, you go to college. If you

againl,”
studies.”

In large cities, students often have ac-
cess-to better teachers and facilities than
in the countryside. Also. there are “key
schools" which are known to have better
teachers and facilities. Competition to
enter a key school is keen.

It is said “once you get into a key school,
you can go into college,’.' Zhang said.

Advancement from each level of schools
ing depends on three exams. The first is
taken after elementary school and deter-
mines who can go into middle schoool (the
Chinese equivalent of high school). Most
students pass this exam. The second is
taken after the first three years of high
school and determines if a student can
enter into a specialized high school. The
third determines college eligibility,

Another contrast with America is that
the drop-out rate is negligible in China. “I
never heard of anyone dropping out of
school in my life," Zhang said.

Zhang thinks that the differences are
due to the fact Americans have “more op-
tions of lifestyle” than do Chinese
students. For one thing. there are no part
time jobs in China for high-School
students, Zhang said.

“I would Venture to say American high
school students are more independent than
in China," Zhang said.

“[There are] not too many choices in
China. [For the most part] everyone is re
quired to take the same courses, despite
the diversity in talent and interests,"
Zhang said.

As for extracurricular.activities, there
are “not ‘a whole lot,” Zhang said.
“Chinese keep a six-day week system.
Most kids are confined to study on the
weekend. They sometimes go out [for
other activities] _ That is, with their
parents or relatives They don’t go to
church, either.”

As for school-sponsored sports events so
much a part of the American highschool
experience, in China “in most cities.
schools don't compete wiﬂa other schools,"
Zhang said, Instead there is usually “an in
tramural meet every spring s a big event
with field and track competitions."

Soccer, ping pong, volleyball, and
basketball are popular but baseball, tennis
and American football (“that was unheard
of") are not.

Dating is also very rare.

Another difference from the American
school system is that there is no such thing
as a high~school counselor,

“You first pick what college you want to
go to then you take the test.

You can list three choices. It’s not like
here where you can apply to as many as
you want," Zhang said.

of the Chinese universities, Beijing
University and Chingrhua University “are
in a class of their own. They are like the
American Ivy League,” Zhang said.

Zhang said that he did not have difficulty
adjusting to the American high-school
system after he came here in 1931. He
noted that since he had gone to seven
elementary schools he had learned how to
get along with a variety of different situa-
tions and people.

Zhang said. “So everyone,
