Student Speaks Out
on South Africa

bYValesta Wiggins

Alter attending the panel discussion
which addressed the issues of divestment
and constructive engagement in South
Africa. I came to the conclusion that
underneath every view or the panel
members. save the South African. was a
paternalistic, eurocentric arrogance. I
wish to address the issues of constructive
engagement and South African invest
ment. and reveal the nonsensical ideology
supporting either or these issues.

Constructive engagement has proven to

be a blatant failure. It began as a friendly. ’

nonconlronlational diplomacy toward the
South African regime. It had high hopes of
slowly but surely dismantling the Apar-
theid (which means separatist) regime,
Since its implementation. four significant
events have taken place during the
Reagan administration: (1|Sanctions
were imposed on the South African govern-
ment. (2) Military aid has been given to
the anticommunist Angolan rebels, 13)
Pretoria's denfense attache (located in
Washington) was expelled and the U.S.
recalled its attache from South Africa as a
result of the South African military's raids
on its neighbors. (4) and President Botha
has recently rejected any attempts by the
US. in seeing an end to the abhorrent
conduct of his regime. Is it necessary to
explain that these actions are certainly not
frlendly. and that ’being nice is not the
answer? Yet there are more reasons to
suggest the ineptitude oi constructive
engagement, Black South African
political organizations have grown . zc
and popularity. especially the African Na-
tional Congress which was banned over
twenty years ago, Its guerrilla warfare
tactics are becoming increasingly
widespread throughout South Africa, in an
attempt to cripple the' regime. Trade
Unions, containing over 300.000 members.
are organizing boycotts as another weapon
against the regime. It is seemingly ob~
vious. over the recent tide of events. that

Remember when Bishop Desmond Tutu

And he’s a (so—called) moderate! One has

South Africa. who should, we negotiate
with»an imbecillic. racist regime; or its
victims who simply want change. and
whose options are running out and whose
patience is running desparately low?

It is a widespread myth that many South
Africans fear the loss of their jobs if US.
corporations divest. South Africa is a
military state and declares it a crime to
advocate divestment. unless one has won
worldwide acclaim Such as Bishop Tltu.
Even he was Silenced upon his first plea
for economic pressures against South
Alrica's government, Do you know that
most of the income of those who work for
our dear corporations is redistributed lo
the white employees? Do you know thatonv
ly one-third of our dear companies have
signed the Sullivan Act. and yet they do not

and South Africa serves most importantly

IBMland American contractors are c'
culating in South Africa's nuclear
duslry. Bankloans from the International
Monetary Fund are used to finance South
Africa's military build-up. And yes, it is
the same military that violently threatens
the members of its country with deadly
weapons.

"It is'seemingly obvious,
the black South
Aﬁ‘iclms will take
control of THEIR
Country "

Moreover. our Continued involvement in
South Africa malntains the morale of its
leadership. We do not pose a dellnitlve
threat. Is it moral to ensure Peter Botha's
morale?

The fact is. south Africans are suffering.

Divestment in South Africa should have
come a long time ago Now. many Euro»
pean countries have banned new in-
vestments in South AlrlCa Any hope of
selling prohiable US, assets under divestr

, 1 stress again, that black power in South
Alrica is inevitable. So why prolong it".

U.S, holdings in South Africa only account ,

for +2:3 billion dollars. Thirteen of the
us. corporations have already left the
country. three of which are General Fonds.

their holdings because sanctions have

multinationals to sell asses and curtail

What does all this mean. in terms of
euroccntrlcism and paternalism? South
Africans do not need the 11.8, to direct,
control and minipulate its struggle, They
have taken It into their own hands. and will
incvltably win. For the US to merely
Spank Botha on the hand and give him an
occasional slap on the face is worthless,
Botha needs to he struck hard! He and his
Dutch regime have never had any business
exploiting lhe resources and labor at an
African nation. And yet it has been the
history of Afrlca to be intentionally

underdeveloped by Western European na-
tions. Thus the perverted ideology toward
protective policies such as constructive
engagement an investment. Why give
Botha‘s regime any mercy through con-
structive engagement and anti~divestment
policies, unless his dwindling power is
deemed necessary for the sake of
perpetuating European control of an
African nation at the expense of ins
numerable African deaths, We are
seriously disillusioned by thinking the

Revolution of my people”

South Africans will be helpless in the
absence of their oppressors.

Finally, what ramifications does this
have for black people in the US? It
represents an irresponsibility to black
Americans. I. for one. do not want to see
my people brutally murdered for the sake
olrkeeping peace with a demonic leader
ship and for the sake of saving corporate
prolits which are made through unethical
labor practices. Remember the, French
and American revolutions Were they not
