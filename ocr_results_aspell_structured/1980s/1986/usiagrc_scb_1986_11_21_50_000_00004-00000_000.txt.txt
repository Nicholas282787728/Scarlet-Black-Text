Ah, Britain. One of the Great Civilizas
tions of All Time. A world of croquet and
cucumber sandwiches, where politeness
and quiet sophistication are a way oi life.

This is the image that used to run
through my head last July while I was pit-
ching pickles at Burger King. i couldn‘t
wait to come to London and have High Tea
served to me by a waiter in a tuxedo who
would pour my tea and then drop the sugar
cubes in one by one at my request.

What I conveniently forgot was that the
thousands oi years necessary tor the
development of such a ciVilized country in-
evitably encouraged the turther growth oi
that scourge oi any society: l-ligh
Bureaucracy,

You may perhaps remember that in an
earlier column I indicated that we had a
phone. This is technically correct: we do
have a piece of machinery encased in
plastic with a dial and a receiver. When
we moved in, our landlady indicated that
we could get |t connected it we so wished.

Well, you know the old Saying: if wishes

students could have Working phones, What
she had neglected to tell us was that the one
ly way to get phone service was to deal
with British Telecom, a prime example oi
how a huge, recently privatized monopoly
can be of the People and For the People
and not care a iig about what happens To
the People: ,

On our first phone call to them, we were
put on hold for three minutes and then con-
nected to the Second Echelon oi Operators,
who said they had no record that our phone
existed. and so couldn't help us. On our sea
cond call, we were more persistent, and
after live minutes on hold we got the Third

they had no record of us either, but that
they could get us hooked up it we put up a

Amazing.

One oi the ﬁrst remarks made when it
was discovered that I was "the one who
does the dorms for the S and B" (a most
unfortunate label ~ so narrow) was “Oh,

I can guess how that would be possible,
When one thinks of Dibble. one tends to
think “oh. the allamale dorm on campus”
rather than "oh, the all»male dorm on

Food Service Changes
Since SAGA Ended

by Sylvia Bachmann

The Grinnell Dining Service is an in»
tegral part oi campus life, and vice versa.
Students on_ board at Grinnell consume
hundreds of loads a week in the dining
halls, and student input is taken very
seriously in preparing and scheduling
meals, However. Grinnell has not always
run its own lood service. From 1958 to 1976.
the SAGA Corporation, a national iood ser:
vice. ran Grinncll College's dining halls.
Students worked in the kitchens, as ever.
and meals were served three times a day.
but there are some distinct differences het-
wcen “then" and “now."

“A corporation has multiapurposes.”
says Dave McConnell. director of dining
services since the change in '76. “It is try-
ing to make a proiit and work with con-
tracts. as well as supply the actual iood. As
a department of the college. our dining ser»
vice has more dollars to work With. since
the profit factor is eliminated It also has
more ﬂexibility and Variety." According
to McConnell. the dining seTVlce can be
more of an actual “service" when it is a
department oi the college For example.
when SAGA delivered special dinners,

they were on Saturday nights, the night
students were LEAST likely to eat on cam-
pus. Now special dinners are held on
Wednesday nights, when more students
are usually around to enjoy them.
Another example oi a change that has
been made is the introduction oi sack lune
ches about three years ago When the din

.ing halls were llooded at noon with

students coming irom 11:00 classes, it was
“physically impossible." as McConnell put
it. for all the students to go through the
lines. eat. and be out by i:otl. Allowing
students to make lunches in the morning
lessened some di burden at noon. Many
students were also delighted that they
could come back from class. and catch
their favorite soap opera that they would
ordinarily miss standing in the long lunch
lines,

Before SAGA. Grinnell was run by the
college as it is now. but without so much
ilexibility and opportunity ior student in-
put. li is good to see a food service that can
change with the times,
