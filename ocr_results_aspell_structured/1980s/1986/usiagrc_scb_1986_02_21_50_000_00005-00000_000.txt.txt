Econ is for the birds

Microeconomics is {or the birds, at least
according to a new experiment in the
Psychology Department.

Juninr Alexa Hoffman, in an indepen
dent project guided by Assistant
Psychology Professor David Lopatto, is in-
vestigating whether pigeons can “earn In-
terest on their income."

“I took Microeconomics with Professor
_[Clifl'ordl Reid and he was interested in
the overlap between economics and

psychology. He sent me some articles,
then I got interested, so I talked to Mr.
Lopatto,” Hoffman explained.

The testing of microseconomlc prin-
ciples through psychology experiments ms

area of study, Lopatto said

What you see,
What you get

Although the power or film a just ask
any politician 7 is felt by all, little has

been done to study the techniques used to

inﬂuence the viewer.

However, here at Grinnell cognitive
psychologist Professor Robert Kraft is
conducting research to study how “the
form of the message influenceslts mean
ing."

Visual messages are a profound force in
America and throughout the world,
capable of mesmerizing large groups of
people, manipulating them. drawing tears
or laughter, affecting their attitudes
without their Consent or often their
awareness,

One goal of Kraft‘s research into the
“psychological reality of cinematic prin-
ciples" is to make people more aware of
the techniques being used and thus reduce
the possibility of blatant manipulation by
such images.

As it is a relatively unexplored area,
Kraft feels the field affords upperslevel
students with an opportunity to be readily
involved in research,

“The people who make commercials and
films use techniques based on the folklore
of film.. These techniques for
manipulaiton are basically untested. some
work and some don’t."

In a recent article in the Grinllell
Magazine Kraft cites the example of cam~
paign commercials used by Presidential
candidate Walter Mondale: in attempting
to “make viewers uncomfortable with the
present political situation” they simply
“made viewers uncomfortable.”

Kraft wants to take the “artistic intui»
[ions that have been developing for nearly
a century and bring them into the
laboratory

This week the so: B puts the spotlight on the
Psychology Department. As cucryone should
know, the de'purtrncnt is running to a new
building to be constructed for fall a] 1987 use.

Previous articles in the S & B have covered
these plans. Howeuer, not many student. who
are not directly involved with the department
are more of the divzrse areas of research cur-
rentfy being explored there.

When inked, many students responded that
they thought "rrit'ce"i'n boxes were mined there
but after that, puzzled looks prevailed,

However, there are no nice in the psych e1-

As an example of ﬁle “hidden effec-
tiveness of cinematic form” he cited the
case of camera angles as one such technis
que that “strongly determines our perceps
tion of what the camera is filming.” For
example, low camera angles can accen»
tuate the strength, boldness, and ag-
gressiveness of a character, affecting the
“viewers’ long-term memory for the ac-
tors and for the plot of the story.”

“Yet after viewing the films [people]
were unable to retain the memory of the
techniques used," he said:

Of rats and men...Cats and kids

Students in psychology may have noted
the layers of cages or white rats with post-
Devo style metal “hats". They are not a
new form ufllve muppets but part oian one
going study that could fundamentally afs
fect the way scientists have come to view
brain disorders, especially schizophrenia.

Thomas Bruzoski, Associate Professor
of Psychology. has been studying brains,
so to speak, since the late 1970‘s. More
speciiically, he is working “to define some
of the brain chemical functions that ac»
company learning and memory," He is
particularly interested in the chemical im-
balances related to Parkinsonism and
schizophrenia,

And how does he go about such a com-
plex matter as delving into the chemistry
of the human brain? why, with rats, of
course.

To those of us who prefer to put the
human brain on an evolutionary pedestal,
the idea that rats’ brains function so
similarly to ours is a little, well, disconcer-
tlng

But actually. Brozoski asserts, the ques
tions addressed by psychological research
are of such a basic level, animal models
are able to provide needed information.

"Primitive mammalian lie. raLs']
systems are not that much dilferent irom
that of a cat which is not that diiierent
from that pic monkey which is not that far
removed train a human," he explained.

The studies Brozoski conducts with the
rats involve equipping the animals with
long-term chronic sensors that rescmbie
little spiked metal hats. They go into the
brain and stay there for the rest of the rat‘s
life, However, he is quick to point out it is
entirely painless,

The brain is unique in that it is devoid of
pain sensations. he said. Even with human

To study early motor development, one
would ordinarily work with young infants,
but there aren’t enough infants in Grinnell,
remarked Assistant Professor of
Psychology Frank Gundkin. So he uses
cats,

Goodkin is currently researching the‘
longitudinal growth of muscles to see how
that influences early movement.

“Most of the work done prevrously has
been in how brain development affects
motor changes,” he said.

The studies have been based on the
assumption made 40 years ago that muscle
growth is influenced by movement. If
movement is prevented, growth is retard»
ed. However, few studies have been made
on how the growth influences movement.

To study this a simple surgical pro-
cedure is performed on the back leg of a
kitten from the Psychology Department’s
cat colony, A muscle is removed from a
ligament that is used in lifting the foot of
the cat. This renders it too long to preserve
the full range of movement The control
muscle is in the other leg.

He then videotapes the cat’s walking.

“Two weeks after surgery, I get a
definite difference in movement between
the leg treated by surgery and the control
leg,” he said.

However, six months later, the
movements in both are the same, as the
muscle in the treated leg has grown con»
siderably to compensate.

He sees the primary outcome of this
research as aiding the evaluation of nor
mal. spontaneous behavior in infants,
However, he does not rule out the possibili-
ty that information uncovered could even-
tually be helpful in detection of disorders
such as Muscular Dystrophy

In the past quite a few students have par-
ticipated in the experiments. Tom
