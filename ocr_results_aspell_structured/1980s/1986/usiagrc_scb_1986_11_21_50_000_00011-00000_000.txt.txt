and many other tield goals will be com-
monplace in Darby gymnasium, as the
men's basketball team opens its season
tomorrow night

Head coach Gar Smith is optimistic
about this year's ballclub. ”rm pleased
with the prospects oi the team. The
players have reasonable size. and are ade-
quate in all aspects oi the game, such as
ballhandiing and shooting." Smith feels
that their sweet touch from the outside will
surprise some teams, especially in the
newly installed three-point line.

The Pioneers are going to need to hit this
perimeter shooting because the forthcom-
ing season looks to be a tough one. Accor-
ding to Smith. their schedule is rather dif-
ficult. as they must play some of the best
teams in the lowa conrerence.

Despite these obstacles, coach Smith
truly believes that his team can post a
respectable record. He realizes, however.
that it will be a test of time. This year's
squad is very young 7 only two seniors
ard four freshmen on the thirteen-man
roster 7 so how they play “1 the early
games should prove to be a good indicator
of how they will iare. ,

This year's ballclub. while young. is still
a good mixture of veteran players and
talented freshmen, Starting for the
Pioneer appear to be returning lettermen

Erik Whitaker and Terry “Lenny" Chapko
at the guards, Steve “Pickle“ Logsdon at
center, and senior captain Darrell Scott at
one of the forward positions. It looks as if
the other starting role will be filled by
senior Dave Nelson. who has been ims
pressive in practice.

Also returning to the lineup are
sophomores Bill “SunnyMagoo” Collins,
Wallace Squibb and Phil Kantzler, three
players who will add strength coming oil
the bench, Providing further depth are the
ireshmen: Scott Snyder. Walt Orzepowski.
Will Sender and Mike “Altredrick 3”
Spurbeck. Junior transfer Mike MCCubbin
has also bee 'mpressive at the guard spot.
and will definitely aid the Pioneer attack.

As he has such a well-rounded and
talented roster. Smith knows that all his
players will get a chance to contribute. He
will have more people than last year.
which results in a more balanced attack,
“This is more of a balanced team ~ ofs
tense. defense. rebounding e than I’ve had
in the past. it the players recognize this,
they will be successful.” With a strong
bench and a talented starting five, success
is well within reach. Smith‘s goal for the
new season is to have the team Continue to
improve throughout the season, ”I expect
to see individual and team product im-
prove with each and every game, If we Can
accomplish this, we should be a successful
team." The Pioneers take their skills to
the court tomorrow night at 7:30 at Upper
Iowa.

Women

by Philip Kantzler

After a somewhat disappointing 6-15
record (2-3 in conierence) last year, the
Pioneer women's basketball team, with a
revamped roster. promises to be vastly
improved this year.

Last year's team was plagued by cons-
tant player changes due to the absence oi
several key players This season, that
should not be the case. With seven players
returning from last season, including the
starting iive. the full-time service oi all the
players. and the addition oi three talented

freshmen will give Coach Dee Fairchild a,.

very solid Club.

Senior coscaptains Liz Schumacher and
Deb Eastman, who missed almost half the
season last year, were Hie leading scorers
last year, both averaging 15 points a game.

Coach Fairchild describes Schumacher as
“one oi our strongest deiensive players.”
Eastman needs only 24 points to break the
career scoring mark oi 791 points currents
ly held by Paula Moon.

Junior Liz Mchmsey led the Pioneers in
rebounding last season. hauling in 9 boards
a game. She also averaged 11 points a
game, 3rd best on the team last year. Mc-
Jimsey will play the post this year to take
advantage of her “ability to move inside”
and ”aggressiveness on the boards". Fair-
Child said. .

Sophomores Jessica Toft and Diana
Lewis will be Counted on to handle the
point guard duties this year. Coach Fair-
child hopes that Toft’s year of experience

Into Season

. Women

Grinnell College is in a reconstruction
phase, While the Physical Education Coma
plex underwent some major changes this

.summer. the women's swim team must
ebuild this winter after the loss of six key
wimmers. including three-time all-
merlcan Sheryl Thediord

“It's going to he a tough season," said

ighthryear Coach Martha Rowedder.

‘l’ll probably have to switch people
round a lot at the beginning at the season
o iigure out where they’ll help us most."

Eight ietterwinners return for the

ioneers. Co-Capzain Leslie Wilgus is the

nly senior on the 28-member ireshman —
nd sophomoredominated squad.

Rowedder will be looking particularly to
juniors Michelle Avolio and Dorothy
Shearn and sophomores Katy Furnish and
Cathy Trout tor depth and experience.

Avolio and Shearn hold school marks in
the 400 1M and 50 iiy. respectively, Furs
nish owns Grinnell's 50 free record and
Competed in the NCAA Division lll na-
tionals last year in her specialty. Trout
performed well last year as a diver. and
Rowedder expects even better things from

will translate into improved floor leader-
ship this year. Fairchild also said mat
Lewis has “improved tremendously."
Last season, me two Combined for ‘76
assists and 75 steals.

Seniors Alexa l-loiiman, who only played
halt of last season, and Beck) Rate, who
missed almost the entire season, are the
other returning players. Their presence
the entire year should benefit the team.
Fairchild describes Rate as a “good out-
side shooter" and says that Hoffman is
“coming on strong."

Three freshman round out this well
balanced team, Laura Van Sickle, at 6'1"
one of the tallest in recent years at Grin-
nell. should have an immediate impact on
the team, “Her height should help the
team on both ends of the floor". says
Coach Fairchild.

The other two ireshmen are Tanya
Hague and Amy Johnson. and they are also
expected to make a contribution this year,
Fairchild calls Johnson “a fundamentally
sound player". and Bagne an “aggressive
and hard Worker". ,

“I feel we should finish in the top half of
our division. If the team gels together like
i think it can. we could give the cm
favorites. Cornell and Monmouth, some
trouble”, Fairchild said.

The first game of the season is Friday.
November 21 against Mount Clare. Tip-cit
is at 7:30 p.n1, in Darby, so come out and
lollow the Pioneers this season.

Bridget VanDorn in freestyle and 1M
and Lisa Bedmger in diving are
Rowedder’s top ireshmen prospects. Van-
Dorn was a four-year letterwinner at East
Waterloo High and was selected most
valuable swimmer her [res an and
sophomore years. while Bedinger was a
state qualifier in diving at Salilha (Kan l

7 Central High.

Even with last year's losses. Rowedder
s‘till sees a conierence finish as high as
third as a possibility. The new scoring rule
in dual meets should help somewhat. ac-
cording to Rowedder. in that the number of
scoring places for any one team has been
increased from three to five.

"Just with our sheer numbers we should
do okay as a team." Rowedder come
merited. “Even so. I think our individuals
will have more opportunities ior success
than the team as a whole,

One of our main goals is to just have
fun. even if we don't win them all. We'll
just have to take it one meet at a “me."
