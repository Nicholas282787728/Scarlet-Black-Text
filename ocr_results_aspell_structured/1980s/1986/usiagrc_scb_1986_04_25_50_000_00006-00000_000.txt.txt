Recent disclosures throw a suspicious
new light on the college's healthy endow»
ment, drawing surprising connections bet-
ween prominent trustees and assorted Las
Vegas casinos.

Recently Grlnnell College announced a
$195 million endowment tor the 1986437
school year. since the college is supposed
to be in the process oi divesting irom many
high yield corporations in south Airica,
one might wonder. where does it all come
from?

Allegedly the college has made a killing
in stock investments due to the bull
market. However, anonymous high
ranking sources within the administration
claim the stock portfolio is merely a covers
up.

“Financial wizards” the source said in
a recent interview. “Those guys? Yeah.
Right."

The recent increase in the endowment.
he claimed, actually originates irom a re
cent lucky strike by the Trustees on a
gambling binge in the silver Slipper casino
in Las Vegas, Nevada

The official said the Trustee gambling
ring has existed lor years,

Each year as soon as iederal. corporate.
and private iunds ior student loans and
grants arrive at the college, the checks
are cashed and the unmarked bills handed
over to the Trustees The mysterious $100
continuing enrollment tee also meets this
late.

The Trustees then take off with their loot
to the gambling dens oi Las Vegas to try
their hand at the tables.

The S&B was able to purchase taped cons
versations at one recent gambling orgy. in
it the voice of Trustee Robert Noyce can be
heard above the sounds of slot machines
and rattling dice.

He shouts, ”Put 'em on number seven.
No. you iool. put’em ALL down! I didn't in-
vent the chip for nothin' !"

Members of the administration could not
be reached for comment.

A page in history was turned over this
week with the appearance of construction
crews and bulldozers outside of Darby
Gynmasium.

Under the orders of Gar Smith, men's
head basketball coach, a Complete securi-
ty system is being built into the gym-
nasium and surrounding grounds.

Smith Said the work was intended to pre
vent Grlnnell students from holding the
traditional semester waltz as Well as
hosting various loud and noisy bands.

”It's Darby GYM, isn’t it?” Smith said.
“Gym means sports,”

Part oi each students activity tee is go-
ing towards putting up a ience around the
gymnasium which will prevent large
groups (orchestras and their instruments
included! from entering the grounds. cur
rently. the bulld ers and construction
crews are in the i tial stages oi plowing
the ground to install the ience.

Landmines and additional defensive ima
placements will be installed over the
summer.

The completed security system will in
clude electrlc monitors at each door and
the Iobbyway.

For those lucky few who do make it
through the Outside fence and the elecc
tronic monitors, more is in store in the
gym itseli. Smith has allocated the use of

additional student tunds to install a com-
plex series oi booby traps placed in
various locations underneath the ﬂoor.
(Copies and corresponding map can be
checked out from the reserve desk in Burla
ing Library).

Why has Smith ordered this massive
security installation? Controvery arose
last December when according to Smith,
“holiday dancers tracked in salt and sand
into Darby and scratched the gym Floor.
Ruined the traction for Sunday's game ”

in additon. Smith's basketball team was
inconvenienced by having to play two oi its
games on the road, This controversy pro-
mpted many others in the athletic depart-
ment to request a new waltz and concert
site for students.

How is this going to aiiect the teams that
have to play in Darby? Says Smith: “Well.
this is obviously going to force the team to
have to play a ditlerent style of basketball.
as well as the rest of the teams that we will
play at home, This is. ol course. going to
require me to rewrite our entire playbook
so our entire team doesn't end up getting
blown out at the gym."

Backed by the administration, Smith is
assuring students that the only parts oi
Darby to not be aitected by the security
measures are KDIC and the Noyce coma
puter terminal room A passcard system
will allow access to those facilities,
