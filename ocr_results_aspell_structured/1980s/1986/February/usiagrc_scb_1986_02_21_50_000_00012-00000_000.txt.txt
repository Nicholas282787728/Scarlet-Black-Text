behave in the same way," he explained.

As an example, he cited a consumer-
preference principle oi economics which'
has been tested extensively with animals
in the past. Given equal access to two come
moditles, there is a maximum set for each
so that in order to get more of one, less oi
the other can be taken.

A perfect substitution Curve shows that
the people involved do not show a
preference and would take either com-
modity. thus receiving the maximum
number of that commodity. However, if
people want variety, the dipping curve
that results shows they must be willing to
sacriiice some quantity. i.

Lopatto used a choice of bread and
pastry to illustrate this principle. People
can take 2|) units of bread and get no pastry
or choose a combination of bread and
pastry but then receive a lesser total. of
only 16 units, tor example. Lopatto said
people will choose the second option since
they want both bread and pastry. Thus, the
principle shows people will choose variety
over quantity.

Similar experiments have been con-

ducted with animals, using food pellets
and locks oi water as the commodities.
The results parallel the human model,
with the animals choosing to give up some
quantity for variety.
_ However. the experiment Hoiiman is
conducting delves into a different
economic mode. This model reﬂects the
tendencies of people to save their money
and earn interest to increase their benefits
rather than to spend it all at once for ins»
tant gratification.

Hoffman’s experiment is to discover if
pigeons will do the same thing. Here the
money has been replaced by food pellets,
the time period decreased to three
minutes, and the interest set at 100 per-
cent.

The computer program, which Lopatto
wrote, allows the pigeon five rein~
iorcements (periods when the pigeon has
access to the food tray) in the first time
period (three minutes). The pigeon can
then peck a key which is white during this
time period and get its reinlorcements or it
can wait until the second time period
starts (indicated by a red light). If the
pigeon does not use all its reinforcements

“saves" some 7 it then ”earns
interest" on them and can receive double
the number or reinforcements in the se-
cond time period.

Lopatto said basically they are asking if
animals’ behavior can be affected by
events far away. (Three months is a long
time tor a pigeon.) it this is the case. the
pigeons “will slow down [their pecking]
and wait to collect more reinforcements.”

Later on the testw will be altered to see if
changing the model (the "interest rates”)
will result in a corresponding change in the
animals' behavior.

Pigeons were chosen as they are color
sensitive and thus would be able to tell
when the different time periods occurred.

Holiman explained the pigeons are “on a
diet” so that they will have more motiva-
tion to respond to the reinforcements.

When asked what time she expects
results from her experiment, Hoffman
responded, “It all depends."

However, Lopatto added, “1 am hoping
Alexa will have interesting data by the end
oi April."

brain surgery “only local anesthesia is us»
ed."

The sensors are capable of detecting
metabolites of some of the important
neuro-transmittors (the Chemicals that
carry messages in the brain). Brozoski is
most interested in one called dopamine.

“[it] seems to be an extremely impor
tant neuro-chemical in the human brain.
Imbalance in dopamine has been found to
underlie Parkinsonism _ a disorder of
movement and intention that generally oc-
curs in middle to old age. More important-
ly, [this] imbalance has been implicated in
a wide variety oi schizophrenic persons."
he explained.

In Brozoski's work, which is “one of the
few instances of research in the sciences at
Grinnell that is completely
computerized." the rats are monitored in
an acoustically and electronically isolated
booth.

Brozoski looks torward to the new
psychology building, tentatively scheduled
for use in the fall of 1987. He admitted,
however, ”I don‘t see mysell adding a
radically diiierent type or program.”

Still, as he backed into a doorway so that

Eissenberg coauthored a paper with
Goodkin based on their work irom last
Summer.

Goodkin suggests that students who are
interested in participating in this type oi
research should iirst take the general and

developmental psychology courses.
Although students involved in his research
in the past have been primarily
psychology majors, he stated. “At this
point, personal interest has a higher
premium than academic background,” as
there is not much literature available on
this topic.

In regard to the new psychbuilding,
slated tor a {all or 19237 opening, he is quite
pleased at the prospect oi more space and
improved iacilitics, especially tlle animal
housing iacilities

”From my point ot‘ view, as l have to get
cats to mate, it will provide a much better
enVIronment." Goodkin said.

While uie women's basketball team lost
to all three at its last season’s opponents,
the iinal results at the games are not in-
dicative of the team's development and
talent this season.

In the game against lowa Wesleyan, the
Pioneers showed definite improvement.
Early in the season the women lost to the
Tigers in Mt. Pleasant, 103»63; this match
ended in only a twenty point diilerence,
74-54.

Essential to this demonstrated improve
ment were Liz Schumacher, Alexa l-loii-
man. and Yvonne Stroud. Coach Dee Fair-
child praised Schumacher ior an “ex
cellent game”. Schumacher’s twenty
points and perfect 10 for lo ioul-linc
shooting combined with Stroud's twelve
points, and Hoffman‘s ten iormed an im-
pressive oiiensive display.

The Coe contest last Saturday was a
replica (If the teams’ two previous
meetings, ending withascore man. This
decision was iinalized with two seconds re-

maining in the first overtime period. Come
menting on the loss. Falrchild said, “We
should have won, and a loss like that in the
linal seconds makes it all the more
irustrating. But we did play well. There’s
no doubt that it was a good game.”

The whole squad put in good perfor-
mances. but especially instrumental were
Stroud. Schumacher, Jessica Toll, and
Elizabeth Mchmsey. Major contributions
irom the ditcnse came by way oi 32 points
from Mchmsey. Toit completed this show
of talent with an impressive defensive
game.

The women’s final conference match
was versus Cornell, resulting in a 61-55
decision against the Pioneers. This close
score represents a banner iinish and
marked improvement in the women’s play
considering that the Cornell squad is the
dwision champ.

Eollowing the game against Cornell, Hie
final game of the season is a non-
conference game teaming the Pioneers
against Mt. St. Clare.

Will Freeman reported that attitude is
playing a major role in the teams' suc-
cesses, as evidenced by the fact that
“there were 12 PR'S (personal records) at
the meet. even though the week’s training
was rigorous. aiming for peak perfor-
mances at the conference meet."

without the viewers remembering the
techniques used to put these memories
there 7 editing, camera angles, etc. — is
and can be a very powerful tool.

However, Kraft does not feel there is
cause ior unnecessary alarm,

“If you look at how social control has
been exerted over the history at
humankind. primarily, social iniluence
has been achieved through force,” Kraft
noted, “The other alternative, which is
persuasion, seems more palatable in com—
parison.”

Therefore, he explained that while his
research can help bring about more per-
suasive visual messages. this will be ac
companied by the increased awareness of
the techniques being used to inﬂuence and
to persuade.

from the beginning made an effort to
restore culture that was lost by displac-

Recently, the NAACP has pointed many

heavy emphasis placed on the value oi the
youth of today and the change that youth
can bring about, The NAACP Youth and
College Division has brought about
dramatic change for blacks by encourag-
ing people to vote, seeking more federal

documenting and trying cases oi racism in
the schools so that they can be more effec-
tively handled and eliminated.

Adult ed.

Ever get the hankering to take an even
lng class? Before you answer, think about
all the things you’ve wanted to learn about
but didn’t have the time,

Now with that in mind. let it be known
that Grinnell Community School system
offers evening Adult Education classes
which are open to college students as well
as to the general populace. There are a
variety of classes offered oi varying dura-

tion and cost, , _ _
Currently, Senior Brian DaVld is enroll

ed in the Beginning Typing Class, a ten-
week course that costs $22. Monda even-
ings irom 743:30 David horrows a riend‘s
car and makes the trek to the high school.

David said he was very pleased to have
this opportunity to improve his typing

‘skills as Grinnell College offers no such

courses.

“1 want to go into journalism, so i think
I'm going to need to be able to type pretty
good," explained David, who has an in-
ternship with the Marshallmwn Times
Republican this semester.

He has found that the others have reallv
been friendly and the teacher is “very
helpful“.

This welcoming attitude toward college
students was reﬂected by Adult Education
Director Joanne Hammelman. She ex
pressed her enthusiasm last week, adding
that although it is too late to register for
the winter session's classes, “If students
have any suggestions for courses they
would be interested in for the spring ses—
5 ion. just let me know. If there's enough in-
terest. we Will try to offer it."

In the past. students and faculty have
sometimes helped teach .classes. Last
semester Lana vick. who graduated in
December. worked in the beginning com-
puter course. Richard Merrill, Ade
ministrative Programmer and Analyst in
Computer Services, has also participated.

The high school is located about 25
minutes away on foot, according to David.
it is nine blocks west of Park Street on
Eighth Avenue.

Hammelman noted that the location
could be a constraint for students without
means of transportation. However, she
said they would be willing to hold a class
here on campus ii there was enough in
teresl and “ii space and equipment were
available". This arran ement would also
have to be approved by t e administration.

Students who have suggestions ior
courses or who are interested in the spring
session, which begins sometime at the en
of March. should write- Joanne Ham»
melman. Adult Education Director. c/o
Grinnell Community Schools. or Call
