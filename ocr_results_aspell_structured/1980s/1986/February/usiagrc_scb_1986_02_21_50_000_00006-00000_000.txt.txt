The Role of SGA

Out of the
trees

One of the persistent dangers of attending
Grinnell or any comparable liberal arls school LII
the fact that it tends to raise our standards
onreatistioalty high. its easy to forget that
while we’re here, we live an ideal thal is other
wise yrelly much unreachable.

It's a s'ad sort of compensation, then, when
something happens on campus to remind us
lholas a species, we have not, after all, been out
of the trees that long.

An immediate case in paint is last week's van-
dalism of a student exhibit in the Negative
Space Gallery. The exhibil's location makes it
almost certain that a student was responsible
[or what happened.

Some people, of course, just like to break
things. But the details of lhe incident, as
reported elsewhere in this issue, strongly sag
gest that the person responsible did it us a sort
of » dare we my it? - political statement.

It's a hell o/ a way to make a political state-
ment.

tter without including his/her name. The

ere not aware that letters to the editor at
time“ had to include a name.

Interestingly, the note was signed with what
ppeored to be a pseudonym, anyway, I wasn't
I ble to find the name in any available directory.

Sorry, but we’re going to stick with this point.
We see the op/ed pages as a medium for a m-
tianal exchange of ideas between members of
the campus community, and we believe that
nonymous views work against that ideal.

A: we see it, a deliberately unsigned letter im~
lies a lock of intellectual courage or conviction,

{any of our readers want to air a view on
these pages, we believe that person should be
willing ta put his/her name behind it.

We are luckier than rnost people in the world
to be able to express our opinions without
danger of reorient. A fear to ezercise that
freedom, whether expressed through
anonymous letters or ananymaus vandalism, is
not reasonable,

Recent issues lacing SGA raise the ques~
non of the role of SGA The jurisdiction of
political resolutions, once passed by SGA
alone, have gone to campusewlde referenr
da. SGA representatives were seen as
representing themselves and not students.
Students-preferred to decide the opinion
themselves. Similarly, many students
think (hat SGA does not have {he right to
donate to charity, because charity is an
issue that should be decided by all students
and not an elite law.

Mike Cl'eary

Students apparently‘ want to decide
political and moral issues themselves.
Distrust oi representatives not doing their
jobs is part ol the reason for this. Besides
that, Grinnelllans today are more concern
ed with their immediate interests.

students argued against SGA charity by
saying that SGA should concern itseli only
with student activities. The scattered op-
position to the decision to boycott MGM
ﬁlms on the grounds that students would
miss classic lilms is another symptom of
this attitude,

Literature is a powerful social force.
However, it is politically neutered by both
the manner oi its teaching and the specific
texts which are taught, What we read
reﬂects and shapes our th'oughts and ac-
tions, thus rallying the social conventions
presented in the texts. We study literature
without examing these conventions in their
social context. Consequently, the study of
literature can only reify past biases, and
not act as a Iorce [or change,

Such a study ol literature perpetuates a
dangerously narrow View 01 society, one
seen lrom an almost exclusively
whltemaleupperclass perspective. The
literary canon excludes the works of
marginalized groups, such as women and
minority writers, Not only does this exclur
slon “deny importance and validity” to the
excluded Writers (in the words of Erlene
Stetsonl. but it also prevents a full
understanding of the traditional texts.
Alter all, marginalized texts are part oi
the social dynamic which engendered the
canon.

The canon of traditionally studied texts
15 one that is composed of primarily
whiteupperclassmen. Such groups as
women, blacks, and homosexuals are Cons
Sidered only peripherally, ii at all. The
dominant and narrow group oi texts
perpetuates the myth that “artist" equals
“male,” and that the artistic faculty ll exV
clusively masculine. The role models pore
lrayed are either whitemale, or are shown
only in relation to a whitemale pros
tagonist.

Traditionally, women and members or
marginalized groups are shown in sub-
missive roles, like Kerduac’s nameless
women, or as bulloorls like Slepln FetchiL
in any oi “his” movies, or as hatchet
Wielding mamas such as Lady MacBelh.
Portrayals like these iurlber marginalize
groups which are already pushed to the
borders oi society

Although it may not be evident lrom the
reading list of a typical literature class
marginalized groups do have artistic
voices, Exclusion oi these marginalized
voices teaches us a View in which such
peripheral groups are all but mvisibile
The ideal presented by canonical writer is
that of [he Whilemale, as in Shakespeare,
Milton. Hemingway. or probably any other
writer you have read in classes, These are

seem to want through its inaction

We should at least remember what more
SGA does besides take care of student ac-
tivities. SGA'S job ls thankless. It attracts
a and deserves 7 criticism for its petty
squabbles, while ll. gets no credit for
managing all the details that make life in
Grinnell more livable.

We should also realize mat SGA can do
more for us. Individual students have
llmlled power. There are some things that
a single Student Cannot do. SGA is snited
far better than the individual student to do
certain things. ‘

By preventing SGA irom representing
the student body in any area, we limit our
own power. This may be natural, given the
lelSan of opinions between students to-
day and the retreat to private concerns.
But if an issue arises that demands action,
we should have the courage to press our
case. Issues such as Curriculum reform,
tuition increases, divestment, charity, and
political lssues are with us already. SGA
will necessarily be part oi that action,

Students choose the rol of SGA by their
activism or their lnact' ily, If we are
mostly content with what SGA does, it only
means we have not considered all the
possible things we can achieve.

The Constitution says that the “object
or SGA IS “to allocate student tunos, ens
courage student debate. sollclt student oplr
moo, and in general address the needs at
students.” How well does SGA tuliill this
“object?"

SGA “encourages debate” through
P.A SF and C, P. SGA representatives
“so lclt” the opinion oi their constituents.
Perhaps they could do better but students
could do even more by taking a more ‘ao
live interest. Controversial issues raised in
SGA attracl attention in themselves.
Perhaps SGA gets a distorted selection or
opinion lrom those who bother to propose
resolutions to it, but this is only reason {or
more involvement.

Then therc are “student needs." SGA
people sit in on Curriculum Council, the
Committee on Student Life, and all the
other committees that. SGA is party to. or
course, there are the many hims, con-
certs, and other student activities that
SGA provides for.

SGA links students with the administra-
tion and the faculty. Through SGA, we can
communicate and understand them better.
AS the representative body oi the studean,
SGA expresses what students want
through its actions and what they do not

represented by other authors, such as Toni
Morrison, lmamu Amlrl Baraka (Leroi

writers are taught very mireouently,
Moreover, even when these contemporary
writers are taught, they are taught
separately, as apart {mm the center, as
peripheral. These marginalized writers
are also laughlas ll they are phenomena ol

roots. Consider the example oi Burling's

The reader must deny his or her member

Unconscious identl cation against the

literature is taught. Most literature
classes are taught from a New Critical
perspective, which is presented as free or
biases. The New Critical approach losters
the myth of the innocent reader and pore
trays the text as impartial. No text.

In addition to looking at the canon '

awareness and selfrawareness of the

This is a call to revolution. We must

In the process, we must (and will) re-

This is an illusory tension which is created
