Iowa endured the McCarthy era free of
most of the hysteria which swept the coun-
try in the Fifties. according to Scholar's
Convocation Speaker Lauren Suth

Soth. a veteran'stafl‘ Writer for the Des
Moines Register and winner of the 1956
Pulitzer Prize for editorials, spoke at Her
rick last Thursday as part of Grinnell's
Iowa Civil Liberties Union commemorate
tion.

Soth opened his lecture with his
historical background, characterizing the
50's as “A time of extraordinary strain on
civil liberties in America " The Cold War.
the Korean War, and the Russian and
Chinese detonation of nuclear weapons
created an unprecedented air of national
panic. he said,

“Fear is the main generator of attacks

‘ on civil liberties.” he said ”It can be easi-
*ly aroused by demagogue's."

lowa, Soth asserted, generally avoided
the extremism which McCarthy's charges
of communist subversion aroused.

”It is my contention that Iowa behaved
comparatively well in resisting assaults on
freedom -— better than most pol' cal,
business and religious leaders did." he
said. -

Supporting his point. Soth pointed out the
lukewarm reception McCarthy himself
received from Iowan politicans. Unlike
other parts of the country where of-
ficeholders would support McCarthy out of
partisan considerations. lowans remained
comparatively quiet,

in the 1954 election campaigns, for ex-
ample, only one state legislator supported
McCarthy’s appearance.

Iowa lawmakers also defeated several
attempts to introduce loyalty oaths like
those pervasive elsewhere in the country,
Soth said. The first such attempt occurred
in 1935, when a bill mandating loyalty
oaths for teachers was killed in commit»
tee.

Soth Speaks on Iowa in McCarthy Period

Loren Soth speaks at Herrick.
Phnlo by Dave Foldinaii.

A second bill. introduced in 1951, would
have allowed school administrations to
dismiss any teachers which it had
“reasonable grounds" to suspect of
subversive activity. it was voted down in
the lowa House “Iowa was the only state
to defeat such a bill by legislative vote."
Soth said \

He Cited Des Moines Register-Tribune
readers' polls from the 50's as evidence of
Iowa's ambivalence towards McCarthy's
accusations, A poll taken in 1952 showed 45
percent of the readers polled supported the
McCarthy investigations. The poll also in-
dicated 35 percent had no opinion, while
only 15 percent opposed his action,

Another poll taken before the army hear»
ings showed support for McCarthy had
fallen off to 12 percent of the readers
surveyed, Thirty-eight percent were
undertain and 35 percent actively opposed
him, Only 15 percent had no opinion.

Soth credited Iowa‘s relative modera-

tion during the Fifties to the quality of its

of educational institutions and quality

The quality of the state's press and the

said.

Soth directed part of his address to col!»

cion and fear of the McCarthy period. he
added, “We may be entering such a period

widespread polygraph testing. and ex

He later referred to a recent survey by
the federal Office of Technology Assess
ment which indicated that one-quarter of

Soth closed the address with his opening
quotation, submitted as a warning [or the
future. “The price or liberty is eternal
vigilance."

Iowa and the ERA

by Blair Davisoii

The Rosenfield Symposium on Political
Crisis and the Iowa Civil Liberties Union
Day culminated in Peg Anderson‘s Speech
on the campaign to adapt the ERA in Iowa.
Followed by a panel discussion,
Anderson’s speech focused on the years
between 1973 and 1580.

Anderson, currently a member oi the
State Board of Regents and the State Atl-
Visory Committee to the United States
Commissmn on Civil Rights, was formerly
the state chair of the Iowa Women‘s
Political Caucus, and the chairwoman of
the Iowa ERA campaign of 1990 Describ-
ing her tenure as chair oi the ERA cams
paign as “exciting and exhileraling”,
Anderson noted ﬁle strengths and the
weaknesses of the 1980 campaign.

At the start of the national ratification
process in W72. Iowa was one of the first
four states to ratify the ERA as a Constitus
tional amendment In fact, Anderson
noted. it was on the last day of the 1972
State Legislative session that the bill was
introduced. and subsequently passed.

Yet from this time onward. the oppostion
argued that ERA would have women and
men sharing bathrooms, legalize

- homosexual marriage. and send mothers
to war

Until 1913, when the antlrERA campaign
was launched, Anderson believed “it was

' an exciting and productive time.” There

was an increase in the number of women in
the legislature and an upswing in the
numbers supporting the ERA but, are
daydream ended with a bill to recind the
1972 ratification. “A litany of fears parad-
ed before us." Ms. Anderson explained.

So, in 1W9 a coalition was formed to
campaign for the upcoming statewide
ballot Vote of 1980.~Upon reflection'on the
Coalition's success. Anderson conceded
that at times the friction between the
members of the group overshadowed their
purpose: “They were an exciting group of
people to work with. but 1 must sayl spent
a lot of time working on internal
conflicts "

The campaign was based on a “strategy
of innoculatlon": the coalition hoped to
educate the public so as to separate issues
from fears, In the end, this goal was not
achieved and the vote was lost, but in the
process of campaigning against a varied
and often radically conservative oppos-
tion Anderson realized the short comings
of the American democratic process,

Anderson asserted that the two most
damaging blows to the Iowan campaign
were the public’s inherent fear to change,
and the metamorphosis of the ERA into a
partisan isue.

During the 1980 Republican convention,
support for the ERA was obscured by the
double convention system of the party.
Anderson, a Republican herself, asserts
that the two conventions — one statutory.
onc presidential, removed the moderates'
support of the ERA from the Republican
platform by drawtng the moderates
toward the presidential rather than the
statutory convention, This loss of the
moderate Republican support allowed for
the radical conservative and fundamenr
talist opinions to manifest themselves.
Once released, the propaganda of the con-
servative and fundamentalists could not
be combatted by the Iowan coalition

Anderson concluded her outline of the
campaign by citing the most damaging op-
position 7 fear. The whole of the basis of
the anti-ERA platform was fear. “It
played on fears, tears or change and the
unknow. it became a religious issue,..it
went to the core of what one believes,”

In the panel discussion that followed.
Anderson, along with Lauren Soth and
Joseph Wall. summarized key points of
their presentations.

The general consensus of the three was
that presently Americans have no major
issue torally behind and theretore, future
defenses of civil liberties will be hard
fought. All three noted, however. that had
it not been for the protests characterizing
the decades of 60's and the 70's, Americans
might today be faced with serious civil
liberties injustice.
