Stoops Conquers Oral History

by May-lee Chai

What is an “oral historian?" The phrase
brings to mind the founders of our percep
tions of civilization — Homer, the Jews
who preserved the “books” of the Bible
orallyI the poet/troubadours of Europe,
the slaves of America.

However, one does not have to content
oneself with written descriptions of these

- artist/scientists — because one is current-
ly living in Grinnell.

Mrs. Rose Stoops is one such “oral
historian" who can recount the lore of
Grinnell history with the spellbinding
vividness and wit of Odysseus combined
with the modern desire for accuracy she
has honed after over 2|) years as head of
the Grinnell Historical Museum.

Stoops, who will retire from her museum
tour duties in June, was born in 1896. A
native Iowan, she has lived in Grinnell
through various times in her life and mov-
ed here permanently in 1951 when she mar-
ried Grinnell philosophy professor John D.
Stoops.

Through her keen observations, exten
sive “files", and innumerable cor-
respondences with Grinnell alums, she is
recognized as a prime source of informa-
tion by professors and residents.

Stoops has witnessed the metamorphosis
of the College from a strait- laced, church
affiliated school to its present state of
diversity.

“Back' in 1902, a woman graduated from
Grinnell and said while she was at college
you couldn’t walk with your date on Surl-
day. They were very strict on that sort of
thing."

“Men were kept on North Campus and
women on South. I think there were visita-
tion rights in later years. [Approximately]

after 1965 we have had the co-ed dorms."

Students themselves have changed as
radically as the living arrangements.

Stoops told of an incident that occurred
when a female student who was rooming in
a boarding house came in rather late one
evening. When she was berated for her
behavior she replied, “Well, but I came
here to get a husband!”

Laughing, Stoops added, “And she did
get a husband. A very respected minister
of the Congregational church,

However, Grinnell’s reputation seems to
have preceded it even back then, Stoops
remembered in the late 1920s, before she
moved to Grinnell, “There was quite a
scandal here. And it was because 01.. .” she
paused dramatically beiore whispering,
“women smoking!"

She recalled an anecdote involving alum
James Norman Hall, class of 1910, author
of Mutiny on the Bounty.

while he was here. students considered
their professors somewhat “naive." Hall
worked as a waiter in the downtown Hotel
Monroe where the waitresses.
unbeknownst to the professors, ”were not
only waitresses but served as conve-
niences for the travelling salesmen.” ,

Of course the 1960's was a period of
tumult and demonstrations by students
“like all young people across the country."

Once the college had to close “early
before commencement in order to avoid
demonstrations of some sort.

“There was some test seniors were sup-
posed to take and one girl, from a iamily of
demonstrators, refused to take it. I think
she got up [during commencement] and
apologized to her parents for not receiving
her diploma.”

As part of this week' 5 Rosenfield sym-
posium, Civil Rights‘ A Completed Task or
Ongoing Process the issue of minorities in
higher education will be addressed by
Mary Frances Berry, former commis»
sioner on the U. S. Commission on Civil
Rights. Grinnell is fortunate to have MS
Berry speak on minorities in higher educa
tion because of her long history of commit-
ment to minorities in higher education.

Like many other midwestern liberal arts
colleges, Grinnell College‘s founder was a
abolitionist.

J. B. Grinnell and those who followed
him westward were Vocal abolitionists
who founded educational institutions open
to people of all races.

In fact, the first black student to enroll at
Grinnell was a black woman who escaped
from slavery in Missouri,

Here too, the radical abolitionist John
Brown was known to have stopped in Grin-
hell on his way to Harper's Ferry.

Grinnell continued its commitment to
minority education after the turn of the
century as President Main established a
scholarship program with Chicago
businessman Julius Rosenwald to bring
qualified black Chicagoans w Grinnell.

Furthermore, Grinnell was able to at-

remember reading about the rest of her
family. it was her parents that sent their
children to school in Des Moines wearing
black armbands to protest the Viet Nam
War. The childen were sent home. The
Supreme Court later reviewed his case,
Tinker v. Des Moines, 1969, and ruled in
favor of the family.

“There were marches,
meetings...Students dressed in the most
freakish manner. One young fellow wrote
an article to the local paper saying
townspeople had slammed the door in his
face, People were really afraid of them
[the students] .”

This was a far cry from the reports of an
alum from the 30’s who told Stoops," We
used to wear silk stockings to class. We
dressed up for college then!"

or the current student body, Stoops said
she has “the general feeling it’s more con-
servative.”

Still, she noted “They haven’t given up.
They still protest things ii they feel they
are morally right." She cited the recent
movement on campus for the divestment
of funds in South Africa as an example.

Stoops is able to recall anecdotes involv—

, ing many of the interesting visitors and

alums of the college. She tells of James
Norman Hall being given a lucky lowa
chutnut while in Grinnell and shortly
thereafter getting his novel, Mutiny on the
Bounty, published. She can speak of
Horace Greeley and his unusual method of
writing ”hieroglyphics" while standing
up, leaning on a bureau.

As for local celebrities, she recounB the
infamous size of Grinnell College Presi—
dent Main’s bathtub which has caused a
later president to refer to a bath in it as a
morning “swim. " The tub, by me way, is
still in Grinnell House.

Stoops, who first got involved with the
Grinnell Historical Museum in 1981 and
has served as Director of the Museum
Auxiliary since 1958, recently announced
her retirement as curator. However, she
will give tours of the museum “at least
once a week."

The Museum which has free admission
is open from 2-5 pm. on Fridays and Saturn
days. Those clubs and groups wishing to
relive history via a Rose Stoops tour are
advised to make an appointment in ad»

tract noted black speakers to campus. Qne
of the most noted was W. E B. Dubois who
came to campus in 1905.

From World War I until after World War
II, the black population at Grinnell dwindla
ed.

, It was not until the late 19405 that Grin-
nell reasserted its commitment to bring
blacks to campus.

From 1947 until 1954, Grinnell had an 30*
Live exchange program with Hampton In-
stitute in Virginia.

Yet Stuart Yeager, in his book The
Black Experience in College: 1863-1954. is
quick to point out that the exchange pres
gram with Hampton was not so much an
effort to further civil rights, but more
similar to a cultural exchange program
where students experience a different
culture for one semester and then return to
their home school.

Through the years, Grinnell students
lost interest in the Hampton exchange pro-
gram and it was discontinued in 1954.

,With the rise of the civil rights move-
ment in the 19605, Grinnell began to active-
ly recruit black students.

In 1965 Grinnell had 15 black students
and by the end of the 19605 the college had
fifty black students enrolled. ‘

Throughout the 1960's, former black
trustee Randell Morgan, from Gary. In-
diana, was very instrumental in helping to
bring black students to Grinnell.

in 1967, the college brought Martin
Luther King Jr. to campus where he spoke
before 3000 people in Darby Gymnasium.

When King was assasinated in April
1968, the college imposed a three day
moratorium on classes and sponsored a
number of speakers to discuss the
assasinaﬂnn.

Yet, Grinnell did reach a crisis period
when a number of black students seized
Burling Library and forced the building
closed until they could negotiate with the
administration.

Joe Wall, retired professor of history,
was at the time of the library seizure die
Dean of the college and one of the principle
negotiators.

Wall said that some of the black
students‘ demands included the establish-
ment of a cultural center, a black admis-
sion officer, an Afro»Amel-ican studies ma-
jor and more black scholarships. Wall said
that almost all of their demands were met.

Furthermore, the college entered a pro-
gram to obtain more black faculty.

Since that time the college has establish- ‘
ed an office of minority affairs and has
continued its effort to attract more black
students.

Wall said that black students of the six»
ties were very separatist and kept to
themselves.

Wall expressed his belief that the college
is much more integrated on campus than
in the past.

Grinnell has a long history of civil rights
and the presence of Mary Frances Berry
this week will be but another Chapter in
Grinnell 5 commitment to further civil
rights through higher education.
