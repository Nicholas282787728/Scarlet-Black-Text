i

By Walt Maley

The Grinnell Pioneers opened their 1986
campaign with an impressive 24-17 victory
over Concordia (Wis). The game was
close the whole way, being tried at 7, 10,
and 17 points. in the end, it was just too
much power up (rent. on both oriense and
defense, displayed by the Pioneer line tor
Concordia to overcome. In fact, had it not
been (or just a couple oi mistakes, the
game would not have been as close as it
was. Ten oi Concordia’s points were diret
results at Pioneer miscues, a touchdown
on a kickoff return, and a iieid goal scored
alter the Concordia drive was kept alive by
a mystery penalty on a punt that lelt Coach
Martinek scratching his head,

However, Grinnell did dominate the
game from a statistical stand point. Grin-
nell rushed ior 354 yards to Concordia 's so,
and in total offense, Grinnell led Concordia
462 yards to 184. Also, Grinnell ran 41 more
offensive plays than their opponent, Two
freshmen had memorable performances
'in their first college game. Wide receiver
Rich Wilson had 7 receptions for 57 yards
and 2 TDs and kicker Mike Mohan made 1
F6 and all three FATS tor the Pioneers.

But perhaps the best game was turned in
by the tront line. On ottense, Henry (Trac-
tor?) Voeglman, Dave Smith, Robert
Burns, Paul Schneider, and Ray Backman
ripped gaping holes in the defense. on
defense, Russ Grimm, Tim Thomas, Tom
Joseph, Mark Martin, and Dan Walsh stuf-
ied Concordia’s offense. _

Pioneer coach John Martinek was pleasV
ed with the win, saying “I thought if we
controlled the line of scrimmage, we would
win, and we did." Martinek also pointed
out that the Pioneers have now won meir
last 3 games in a row, and «f of their last
five dating back to last season. If the Grin»
nell wins on Saturday against Concordia of
Illinois, it would be the first time since 1970
that they have won 4 in a row. Also, before .
this year, Grinnell had not won their
season opener in four years, indeed, this
year’s team looks promising.

This week Grinnell knocks heads with
another Concordia, this one from Illinois.
Concordia comes to town boasting one of
the besl quarterbacks in NCAA division III
who will test the staunch defense. Concor»
dia lost last Saturday to Lake Forest 34-14.
Kickoff is at 1:30 as the undefeated

Division ill national runnerpp last
season, in a 3-0 loss. lcould see some im-

provement and more team cohesiveness,"
Piitsch declared,

In the Washington match the Pioneers

Crack! Wood hits wood and the taste
[lying women are off! Paula picks it up on
the inside. loses her defense and passes it
oil to Becky who takes two steps to the leit
betore driving the ball upfield to Danielle.
Danielle picks it up on the outside, sweeps
past her defense, and passes it off to Cathy
- who cuts across the field and goes in for
the goal , but wait} There's an intercep-
tion! The opposing - what’s that? All ten
opposing teams rush over and pick up,
that‘s right, pick up the ball and rush out
into NEVer~Never land! But where’s the
ball? The competition? The game?

Probably somewhere in the East _ in a
big city, it’s definitely in Ohio. Unfor-
tunately, it’s no longer found in Grinell.

“I wish it was still here.” said Junior
Maureen Bittner, Most Improved player of
the '85 squad. “I loved it! It was a really
great team . great coach » great sport! ”

Placing fourth in the Division III GReat
Lakes Regional Competition, the
Pioneers’s Varsity Field Hockey team
ended their eleven year tradition with a
season record of 10-5-1. And as former
Coach Dee Fairchild notes, “They were
good!”

For the Grinnell Athletics Program, the
decision to drop the Women’s Field
Hockey team ws not voluntary, it was in
evitable, As Terri Porter, Assistant Sports
Information Director explains. “There
weren't enough teams in the schedule to
play." It was “a snowball effect,” said
Coach F‘alrchild, who coached field hockey
in it years beiore coming to Grinnell in ’84.
“One dropped then another dropped . . .
Carleton and Grinnell were the last two to
drop."

Every school on the Ploneers' schedule
cut iield hockey from their sportspro-
grams with the exception of those located
in Ohio and Michigan. Field hockey, accor-
ding to Fairchild, “is a dying sport in the
Midwest and has been for a long time." As
the Midwest high schools can no longer af-
tord to carry it, there is no ieeder program

for the surrounding Colleges and univer- '

Sities,

Economics has wiped iield hockey oil
the tield and heralded in Women‘s soccer,
an incrasingly popular sport, After all,
notes Fairchild, “It’s much cheaper to buy
one soccer ball than to buy 22 hockey sticks
at $30 a piece."

Former player Blair Davison ’89 [eels
however, “Nothing can replace field
hockey . . . There is just something about
the whole sport . . . something so fun about
having this stick and having your friends
around you and getting that ball in the box
. . There is nothing that-s equivalent to it,"

Dorothy Shearn ’88, felt the best part of
playing hockey was the “cumraderie,” We
were a really close team," she ecalls, “we
worked well together and we had so much
fun." Maureen Bittner said it was a
“chance to meet people from North Cam-
pus, South campus and on campus." “I
know," she continued, “I wouldn't have
met alot of those people otherwise."

For some Freshmen players, the
elimination of field hockey brought on
thoughts of transferring. “I‘ve always
ielt,” commented Fairchild, “mat the
field hockey athlete was a little different,
(she) seemed as on a whole. more
dedicated to the sport "

With 6, 7, even 8 years of field hockey
behind them. many hockey players round
it dlfflcult to retlre their plaid kilts and
hang up their cleats, Nevertheless, some
women headed out to the volleybvall court,
soccer field, or cross country course to
race new challenges. While others jumped
into Intramural: or started an afternoon
pool workout.

Whatever has been taken up in its stead,
however, will probably never replace the
game of hockey. For as Davison remarks,
“It just doesn't feel like Fall without field
hockey."

Next Week... RUGBY!
