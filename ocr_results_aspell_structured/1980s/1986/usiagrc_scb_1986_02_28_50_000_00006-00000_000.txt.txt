The Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra has
earned a reputation as one of the world’s
finest chamber orchestras. Located in the
Twin cities or Minneapolis and Saint Paul,

recognized internationally ior versatility
and excellence in performance, program-

Founded in 1959 by a group oi Saint Paul
.citizens seeking a conductor to bring
together a group of professional musi-
cians, the orchestra was first directed by
Leopold Sipe. His orchestra, named the
Saint Paul Philharmonic, consisted at 24
free-lance musicians who worked with
young musicians and presented new
works.

By 1966, the orchestra presented a
Ill-concert season and made its New York
debut. Within two years, Sipe and the
Philharmonic Society created the nation’s
first full~time professional chamber or-
chestra under the new name of The Saint
Paul Chamber Orchestra. In 1980 Pinchas
Zukerrnan. the international talent who
combines the roles oi violin and viola

The Grinnell Humane Society hopes to
be able to financially aid the adoption pro-
cess ii necesary. The week~long period oi
grace can be extended by paying for the
animal's board.

“You’ve gotta shout when it hits you,
Yes indeed, yes indeed,

And when the spirit moves you,
You'll shout HALLELUJAH,
Hallelujah, when it hits you,
Yes, indeed.”

Jam-packed with lively, jubilant, clap
yourhands, stampyour-ieet, shout-it—out
songs, Sharon, Lois, Bram, a group of
Canadian children’s musicians, will be at
the college Wednesday. March 5.

Fresh from a successful tour that took
them from California to Houston to a sold
outshow at Harvard, Sharon, Lois, Bram
will periorm at 7:00 pm, in Roberts
Theatre. ,

Their first album, “One Elephant, Deux
Elephants," was an immediate hit and
soon became the fastestrselling children’s
album ever produced in Canada. Even the
adults liked it, and at Sharon, Lois. Bram
concerts, it's not merely the young‘uns but
oiten the ‘grown-ups’ who are doing the
whistle-pulls and singing the tooHoots to
songs like “Coming Round the Mounmin.”

Since those modest beginnings, Sharon,
Lois, Bram have made five other albums,
Won Juno awards (the Canadian
equivalent of the Grammy) for best
children’s album, and have been welcome
ed and loved throughout Canada and the
United States.

Sharon, Lois, Bram concerts, usually
about an hour long, are said to rival Pete
Seeger's for audience participation. :eo-
ple Stand up and sit down, all in three pa.
harmony, to “George Washington
Bridge.” They come up and jump around

ior the elephant song, throw their hands in
the air tor “Tingalayo,” use all sorts oi
hand actions ior “Little Rabbit Fufu,”
“The Eensy Weensy Spider” and “Head
and Shoulders, Baby," and generally sing
out loud, iniected by the contagious energy
oi hundreds oi children doing likewise.

So ior all or you who signed the petition
recently ior that ”children’s concert," and
indeed everyone else, beiore you hit the
books Wednesday, come by Roberts at 7
pm. ior an hour oi superb entertainment.
