The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance

By Georgia Dental

THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY
VALANCE ”962i is probably the most
widely analyzed and discussed oi the Ford
westerns. The film contrasts the old fron-
tier West t”The Wilderness") with the
emerging West l"The Garden"). thereby.
according to writer DaVld Coursen. "giv-
ing Ford opportunity to make oi it a
meditation on a large part of the mythic
territory which he invented and embellish~
ed in more than four decades of film malts
iiig." (Thai is. Ford is able to question the
myth on which he based all his other
films t

In many Ford films. particularly those
dealing with the military. and also in
LIBERTY VALANCE. there is Iocus to
subordinate the individual will to a colleen
tive struggle. usually represented by a
nuclear family. ior some greater good: in
this case. to civilize the frontier. However.
throughout the film Ford clearly questions
whether the outcome justifies tl‘lt'
sacrilices required,

Symbolism and irony abound: note in
particular the schoolroom scene, the
repeated destruction of pages represen-
ting law and truth. the severe contrasts
between the early and modern town or
Shinbone. the contrast between Tom's and
Liberty's horses and the trains which

horses as Tom's rallch burns. Liberty's
one and only use ol a wagon as opposed to a
horse. the use of a horse at Ihc territorial
convention. and the final scene on the
train.

interestingly. Ford uses the same theme
music in LIBERTY VALANCE as he used
lll YOUNG MR, LINCOLN. However. in
LINCOLN. writer Coursen points out. “the
music evokes a consistent set of feelings"
about Alin Rutledge and her confldencne ili
Abe‘s ability to attain important objec-
tives. In LIBERTY VALANCE. on the
other hand, the theme is associated with
idealized and obviously unobtainable ob~
Jectives.

LIBERTY VALANCE is a story of
villany and love. Tom. who cannot
ultimately fit into the pattern of the film's
tamily. is played by John Wayne in one oi
his best roles. James Stewart plays Ranse
Stoddard. and villain Liberty is played by
Lce Marvin. Although uncharacteristic of
Ford in its somewhat slower pace. LIBER»
TY VALANCE rewards the viewer with its
character development. symbolism. and
eventually. with its surprise ending.
