The Builders

I walk a lot. Mainly to school and back
home again to my house on 4th Ave. but I
also like to take walks just for the enjoy-
ment of observing the changes that seem
to occur everyday through the weather
and in the face of the town itself. I get
great enjoyment from studying th ‘nany

different rsonalities oi the houst.,

rm also invariably upset when 1 pass an
old Victorian beauty which has been in
some way mutilated or redone in an at-
tempt to bring it up to date with the latest
trends. A couple of weeks ago, one of my
walks for pleasure was completely
destroyed when I passed the house at 1i27
Park Street. I had resigned myself to the
fact that practically the whole row of
college-owned houses from Macy House on
6th Ave. all the way up to 8th Ave. had been
sacrificed to the school of thought where
beauty is better viewed through ﬂuores-
cent lighting and where it is more impor-
tant to degrade a structure to a level where
easy maintenance takes precedence over
finely craf ted woodwork and the preserva-
tion of the esthetic values which bring an
era now past closer to our understanding.

Yes, I had been able to merely wince at
this past insensitivity, and be thankful that
at least the main structures were still stan-
ding, albeit minus much of their original
charm, but when I came upon 1205 Park
and saw that a dump truck had been back-
ed up to the doorway so carelessly as to
bash in one oi the supporting posts of the
front porch, my heart sank a little iurther
in drinking that one of my favorite houses
was on its way to the land of pleasant
memories,

That was a couple of weeks ago. i had
tried to simply tell myself that what was
being done to the house would merely
disguise the truth of its charm by maybe
painting over old woodwork and adding in
appropriate new interior doors and
ﬂuorescent lights and ugly lowered ceil-
ings. As much as I hate the above mention-
ed, I thought that in the future, when peer
ple come to their senses and see the impor-
tance of preservation, then all of these
could be removed and the old house
restored to its rightful beauty,

However, yesterday I could not believe
my eyes when I came out from the college
post office and saw the beautiful double
doors flung wide open to facilitate the haul-
ing out of woodwork to the already loaded
truckbed. Yes, uiey have entirely gutted
that house! The frosted glass window
above the front door has been carelessly
broken and I‘m told that the fireplaces
have been ripped out without even a
thought of salvaging them for some other
use.

That does it! As a person who is not only
a student at Grinnell College, but a resi-
dent of this town, I’m tired of seeing Grin-
nell's heritage and charm being destroyed
with the college seeming to lead the
parade of destruction. One need only go to
the Grinnell Museum and look at pictures
of Grinnell at the turn of the century and
before the 1960's to see how great the
losses have been. I dare say that the
preservation of the existing structures of
the time would have made Grinnell a
prime tourist attraction because of it’s
Victorian charm. But believing ourselves
to be progressive, or simply just not hav»
ing the foresight or patience to deal with
the maintenance of the beautiful architecr
tural legacy left to us by the first people to
build on these great Midwestern prairies,
we’ve destroyed what could have been a
great boost to this town’s economy in this
time of financial hardship. I point to Fella
and Galena, Illinois as prime examples of
towns who are realizing the rewards of
their sensitivity and sensibility in main-
taining the good things that they have been
so lucky to inherit.

I would urge those in charge here at
Grinnell College to look at the campus and
collegeowned housing of Williams College
in Williamstown, Massachusetts. They
have kept themselves up to date and met

ever growing needs with the addition of
new buildings, but they have shown a great
deal of intelligence in preserving the
charm and character of their old
buildings I truly wish that I could say that
intelligence of that sort is in evidence at
Grinnell.

I can only cite one example of an at-
tempt to preserve an old structure, that be
ing the renovation of Mears Hall. I find it
very encouraging that efforts have been
taken to preserve its Victorian integrity
and loveliness. It can never be like it was,
but the point is that this renovati n is being
done with intelligence and sensi vity. It is
understandable that some of its interior
charm will have to be traded for its new
function as an office building, but it would
seem that the offices are being made to fit
the building, ramer than the building to fit
the offices. 1 can't forget, however, that
Mears Cottage, which in my eyes is destin-
ed to be the loveliest building on campus.
was on its way to being razed only a few
years ago. Only because of the efforts of
concerned students was Meats placed on
the National Register of Historic Places,
forcing the administration to take another
route than demolition. It would certainly
have been easier to have pushed it in, but
look what would have been lost. Not only
the example of 1880‘s cottage architecture
and all of its charms, but the memories of
alumni who once lived there and the great
feeling of knowing that here stands a
building which was the first women’s dor~
mitory west oi the Mississippi River.
However; this college has done far more
damage than good: is demolition of
Cooper School m which would have provide
ed wonderful facultyrstudent studio space
as a supplement to the terrible, inadequate
facilities of the Fine Arts building The
razing of the old Iowa Theatre, where Bob
Reimers Clothing store (recently defunct)
now stands. It’s said that Gary Cooper
acted on that stage. Silly little bits of
nostalgia like that add more than people
realize to the appeal of a place, It sets imr
aginations going and contributes to a feels
ing of being someuiing special — but that
is lost forever now. The list goes on to in-
clude the old women's gym, Blair Hall, the
former home of professor and Rose Stoops
an die corner of ﬁth and Park. Don’t tell me
that the college couldn’t afford to keep
these buildings. How could it afford not to?

what are you trying to instill in the men
and women who go to school here? That we
have nothing to learn from history? That
the men and women who spent precious
time and talents on building a beautiful
legacy for the future were wasting meir
time’! That knowledge has nothing to do
with one’s environment, or with beauty or
history?

I am very, very ashamed of all of you
people who have no regard for the lives of
the people who have gone before us in this
life, and who worked so that one day we
would enjoy the fruits of their labors and
resources. But instead of building on this
beautiful gift of the past, instead of
thankfully enjoying the love and optimism
that shines through these old buildings as a

'witness to the hope and trust of our

predecessors, our fathers and mothers,
our grandfathers and great~grandfathers,
etc., you thoughtlessly destroy. You spit in
the faces of our ancestors and like
ungrateful children you have no regard for
their sweat or their tears or their joys or
their love.

All are architects of Fate,
Working in these walls of Time;
Some with massive deeds and great,
Some with ornaments of rhyme.
Nothing useless is. or low;
Each doing in its place is best;
And what seems but idle show
Strengthens and supports the rest.
For the structure that we raise,
Time is with materials filled;
Our todays and yesterdays
Are the blocks with which we build.

Equality

Equality. The idea of equality is at once
beautifully simple and tremendously comr
plex. Equality is as basic as the most fun
damental tenets of our country and as sim-
ple as the opportunity for all citizens to
take advantage of what our country has to
offer. And yet, the realization of Such a
basic notion is more complicated than
nearly any other. To examine and unders»
and what equality means in the real world
is as awesome a task as any which con
fronts democracy. But regardless of the
difficulty required to see the goal of equali-
ty, it is our obligation to ourselves to see it.
For whatever one’s view of equality, one
thing cannot be denied; the right of every
citizen to the treatment and privileges of
every other must be ensured or our system
of government which we so proudly call a
democracy will be no democracy at all. We
owe ourselves the realization of the dream
which began two hundred years ago,

That dream, which took roots at the
birth of this nation, was for many years
dormant. The lofty words of the Declara-
tion of independence sat under glass in
Washington while their concrete expres-
sion'remained silenced. America was for
many years a state of and for white men,
Women and Blacks were not citizens and
thus had no right to take part in the bounty
of the country. Whether or not this was
what the farmers of the Constitution had
envisioned, it was certainly far short of the
potential of their ideas, While the farmers
may have been constrained in thought by
the conditions of their time, they were vi~
sionaries, and in the thoughts they had lay
great potential.

it was not until thirty years ago mat the
people of this country began to realize that
the potential was still only a dream. The
realization came as the result of thoefforts
oi people who had long been denied that
dream, The demand was simple: the right
to partake in all that our nation stood for
and which the rest of the country had had
from the beginning. The question of
“right” was a hard one for America to
swallow because what was at issue was
Justice. That justice had not been done
when the country’s image of itself was
seen in the light of its ideals was painful to
accept. But accept it we did, at least in the
form of laws.

It is important to understand that it is no
small thing that the Civil Rights Acts, the
Voting Rights Act and Fair Housing Act
were enacted. They were the establish-
ment of the right to equality. However
vehemently one may have argued for the
existence of inherent rights, the fact is that
in society there are no rights except those
which are established by government.
That the government finally provided
those rights was crucial. But this is the
least that can be done. Rights lose their
weight unless they are enforced and exer-
cised. The awareness of their meaning and
an active pursuit of them is the only thing
which keeps them alive.

An ideal expression or parh‘cipatory
democracy led to the enacment of the
civil rights laws. It is still a paradigm for
which to reach. The Civil Rights Move-
ment taught us to examine our condition
and gave us the understanding which was
needed to change it. That understanding
and awareness is as important today as it
ever was. It is indeed more important. For
if we are to keep those rights which were
so hard won, we must look at ourselves
with a keener vision than ever. The civil
rights symposium this week is a chance to
do just that.

The passing of Martin Luther King’s bir-
thday this year as a national holiday was
an important step towards self-
examination. That it came and went at
Grinnell without so much as a public word
is unfortunate and a strong reminder that
it is all too easy to forget. It is no coins
cidence that Dr. King was black — his peo»
ple have been the most consistently ex-
cluded single group in our country. But

Letters

what Blacks did for the rest of the country
by exposing the painful reality of America
was a gift to all oppressed groups. More
fundamentally, the Civil Rights Movement
gave us all a true conception of how high
our ideals are and how far short of them
we fall, 0n the occasion of this civil rights
symposium, let us take this chance to cons
tinue the look at ourselves. We owe
ourselves nothing less. — Jacques Sand-
berg

C1v11 Rights

“Civil Rights Symposium" announced
the notecards that were placed on each
table in the forum grill. On nearly every
one someone had written, in pencil,
various quips such as “Hey, gays don‘t
have civil rights yet do they?" and “Gays
need rights too.”

Rather unthinkingly, l agreed with the
people who had written on mese cards,
realizing immediately where uie emotions
had come from which triggered the graf-
fiti. The writers, Iassume, were objecting
to two things: the use of the words “civil
rights" to refer to what appeared to be an
exclusively race—oriented symposium (for
gays and other minorities are often sen-
sitive to the fact that blacks sometimes
seem to have a monopoly on the term civil
rights); and to the title of the sponsoring
group, the "Office of Minority Affairs.”

I assume that these individuals were not
opposed to the organization itself, but to

* the misleading nature of its name (the
Minority Affairs Office is. in practice, not
concerned with minorities in general).

Until Cynthia Bradley made me aware
that several of the students who had work
ed very hard at putting together the Symr
posium were extremely angry that the an-
nouncements had been defaced, I did not
think seriously about the act. While I find
the commentrwriter's response understan-
dable and believe that (what I understand
their complaints to be) are valid, I now
realize that their response (and mine, too,
for I was initially in accordance with
them) was misdirected and irresponsible.

The students who acted upon ureir emo-
tions in writing on the announcements pros
bably did not act with malevolence, They
took the announcement personally 7 but I
doubt if it occurred to them that what they
wrote would also be taken personally by
those responsible for the symposium:
other students.

Grinnell students generally make a
habit of voicing their opinions, especially
when something affects us personally.
What we need to realize is that there are
both constructive and destructive ways to
make our feelings known, and that graffiti

type writing is neither harmless or effec-
tive. — Kerry Wickham.
