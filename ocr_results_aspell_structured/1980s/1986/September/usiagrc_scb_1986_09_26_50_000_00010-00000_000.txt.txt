Plitsch noted that, compared to other
teams on Grinnell's schedule, Cornell's
squad was “fairly weak’ . and a particular
contrast to nationallyrranked Washington
University in St. Louis. which handed the
Pioneers a 3-0 loss last week. “They played
very welI despite the Washington loss,”
Pfitsch said, “and showed much improve
ment "

The pioneers enjoyed a lorday break
between the Washington and Cornell
games. and Pfitsch believes this was
benelicial to the team's improvement. He
cited the Cornell match as a delinite
conl'idencebuilder
