Even today, thirty—one years aiter uie

issue at her death still incites debate and
controversy in Great Britain. The 1985 iilm
DANCE WITH A STRANGER details
Ellis‘ troubled early liie, and her seli-
destructive attractions to men who were
oitcn cruel and abusive, iocusing on her
iinal relationship with a philandering,
upperclass twit whom she shot and killed
aiter a jealous agrument. The iilm
touches momentarily on Ellis‘ trial and
hanging. which was the last execution or a

The political satire oi the “Model

in the iilm. it is also probably part oi the

Guadalcanal Diary

By Kristen Stromberg

Guadalcanal Diary may be an obscure
name for a group, but it will no doubt
become better known in the future. Their

‘=‘ second album, released this summer. has
. been getting a lot oi college station play

and has received favorable reviews in nia-
jor music magazines.

"Jamboree" shows a great deal oi in-
novation and musical growth. making it a

, more accessable album than their lirst,
"Walking in the Shadow of the Big Man."
Although hardfore lovers will sneer at
their latest effort, it is the kind of album

‘ that doesn’t wear on you. and at the same

‘ time you can hum the tunes.

Guadalcanal Diary is one of those rare
bands that can successfully balance good
vocals and good, varied music. They pack
so much variation into one album that it is

hard to detine their style, although strong
guitar melodies are present throughout.
The lyrics are very unpretentious, arid the
laughable words of "Cattle Prod" don’t let
you get the wrong idea and take th
band's "depth" too seriously. “Jamboree”
combines haunting ballads such as “Loner
ly Street" with songs like “I See Moe.” the
confessions ot a man who looks into the
mirror and sees “not Larry or Curly but
Moe."

Guadalcanal Diary’s music does not
have a strong dance beat or a highstech
New»Wave sound; it‘s a sincere eiiort to
have fun while playing the best they can.
coming out with a sound somewhat like
“Let’s Active” or "Lloyd Cole and the
Commontons.l' if you didn’t already catch
them in Iowa City on September 2ist.

”Jamboree" is deﬁnitely worth the ex,
pense of buying the album.
