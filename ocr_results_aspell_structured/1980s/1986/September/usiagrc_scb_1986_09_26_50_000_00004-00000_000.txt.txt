London

By Shelley Reid
An apartment in Grinnell is just that: an
apartment in Grinnell. lowa. But our cat
in London is actually a flat in Kllburn,
Borough of Brent, City of Westminster,
Greater London. Having an address like
that is almost as impressive as being able
to trace your ancestry back to the time of
Henry vni, it's a pain to try to squeeze all
that into the upperrleft corner at an
envelope so we just say Kilburn to other
Londoners or London to everyone else.
Our particular area of Kilburn is a bit
rundown. especially just to the north of us,
Not a slum, by any means. but not
somewhere rd like to be alone at night.

ly, do not iorget that your reirigerator is
only the size of a large stereo speaker, with
a freezer die size ot a shoebox.

For smaller shopping trips, we have a
good selection of privatelyowned rood
shops nearby Fresh produce and freshly
baked bread are easily available and
reasonably priced. There are also two
meat stores. either oi which will sell you a
roasting chicken with head. ieet, and a tew
odd feathers still attached, Do not attempt
to prepare this it you have a dull knile and
don’t know what you are doing. Just down
the street is a shop where the fish stare
blankly up at you as you wander past, Beef
and pork still come in vaguely

 

Just next to us, though, lies Maida Vale,
which is an entirely different story. This
place is Posh in every sense of the word,
The ﬂats in Maida Vale are, I guess, the

equivalent to expensive American
townhomes, with balconies, doorman, and
immaculately-groomed lawns out iront.
Not to mention the Mercedes, Rolls
Royces, Porsches, and Jaguars parked
along the street. It’s a scenic, if a bit
longer, walk to the tube stop during the
day, anda safe one at night, After all, what
could we have that anyone in Maida Vale
would want to steal?

The prices are better in Kilburn,
however, so that's where we do our shop ,
ing Now, the first thing the Grinnell-ln-
London Handbook says about shopping in
London is “Don't shop on Saturdays." Un-
doubtedly this is why We set out on our first
major shopping trip at 10:00 Saturday
morning. We thought that we ought to get
some food in the flat before all the stores
closed [or the Bank Holiday (three-day)
weekend. i suppose it is nice to know that
after only four days in London we were
thinking like natives. In fact, I believe the
entire population of Kilburn, using the
same logic. had headed for Kilburn High
Road just ﬁfteen minutes before we did,

I have some advice of my own for would-
be London shoppers. Do not. attempt to
comparison-shop in stores that are as
crowded as toy shops the week before
Christmas. Do not forget that you will have
to carry everything you buy all the way
home, This is the only time I miss having a

-car; the plastic carryout bags that the
larger stores will happily sell you will,
once weighted down with cartons of milk
and packages or sugar. cut on circulation
to your fingers as efficiently as any
medieval instrument of torture. And final—

. i
recognizable cuts, but with amazing price
tags.

We’ve also done some exploring in our
neighborhood besides the shopping. In the
interest of scientiiic inquiry, we've gone to
the pub down the street and sampled their
cider. With the courage of the great ex-
plorers, we have surveyed our
neighborhood park; Paddington Recrea-
tion Center has everything from rose
gardens to cricket fields (not that we know
anything about cricket). And with the
foresight of Aesop's Ant. we have staked
out the local library, It’s not as comforr
table as Burling, but even in November
they throw in heat and light at no extra
cost (except on Sundays, when they’re
closed and we have to stay home and pay
for it ourselves),

in fact, the only things in our immediate
area with which we are not familiar are
our upstairs neighbors. Having met their
friends who often ring the wrong doorbell,
listened to their music at all hours of the
day and night (we think they sleep in
shiltsl, and tripped over their motorcycle
in the downstairs entryway, we've decided
that it is best to keep relations with them to
a bare minimum.

While we may never be able to wander
through Greater London without a
[so-page A-Z map, we are gradually get-
ting to know a small piece ofit pretty well.
it may not seem like much, but it is quite
satistying to have someone stop me to ask
directions, and be able to give them
without hesitation, as politely as possible
despite my American accent. For someone
who still confuses Main Street and Broad
Street in Grinnell, this is much more ex-
citing than being able to trace my
ancestors back to Henry VIII.

New Countries
Represented

By Bruce Emond

Maybe something could be said for
Midwestern hospitality, or there is some
peculiar subliminal attraction in acre upon
acre of corn fields which accounts tor the
many foreign students who choose Grin-
neil every year. The Class of 1990 includes
22 International students, Six of whom,
from Benin, Kenya, Nepal, Papua New
Guinea, Sri Lanka. and Sweden, are the
first representatives of their countries at
Grinnell. Several of the International
students were interviewed to gain a
perspective on their home countries, the
reasons Why they chose Grinnell, what
they think of it, and their opinion at the
United States,

For Faisal Khan, the adjustment has
perhaps been less traumatic as he had
been exposed to American lifestyles and
people when he attended an International
school in his native India. He had alsollvecl
in Chicago for a year when his father was a
Visiting protessor

Faisal had always planned to attend an
American technical college, not a liberal
arts one. He summed up his reasons inr
coming to Grinnell as “the literature, the
financial aid. and Presmleni Drake's pic»
Lures, too " While describing the campus
as “a bit too small sometimes,” and noting
that he occasionally is homesxck for Indian
cuisine, Faisal likes the facilities and the
relaxed campus atmosphere. “It is a lot
less restricted here than in India and
women are much freer," he said.

According to Faisal, most Indians
perceive American society as a vast enters
tainment and sex center because they only
come into Contact with the US, through
movies. Faisal cautioned that President
Reagan’s toreign policy regardin third-
world nations is causing extreme amage
to U,S,-Indian relations, “America is so
advanced but they Sell outdated
technology to developing countries, Indian
people think that Reagan doesn‘t care
about the rest of the world and that is
reflected in our government's leaning
toward the Soviets,"

“This is the first time I've been away by
myself and although I'd visited the U.S.
before, everything seems different," said
Camilla Rab, a student from Pakistan,
Camilla applied to schools all over the US
but chose Grinnell because she wanted a
different experience irom her other
Pakistani friends attending colleges in the
East and West,

Camilla contends that people from the
Midwest are more caring than their East
coast counterparts. “The first few days
here, lstayed with a host family and they
were genuinely interested in me, but in
New York, people aren’t bothered.”

Coming from Pakistan where servants
are commonplace, Camilla has had to ad-
just to doing the laundry and working in
the dining hall, butshe is gradually getting
used to the new work. About Americans,
Camilla noted that many seem uninformed
about world affairs 7 some did not know
anything about Pakistan ~ and that
Americans are more fickle, with
everything constantly changing. America
is more liberal than Pakistan and Camilla
says American moral standards would
seem very low in Islamic Pakistan, but
that she accepts this as part of the respecs
tive cultures. As a woman, she is much
freer in the U.S. than in Pakistan where
women are still expected to pursue tradiv
tional roles, even in the relatively
cosmopolitan city of Karachi,

Camilla also found the casualness of life
here astounding, particularly clothing,
when compared with Pakistan where life
is very formal. Camilla has made a lot of
American iriends yet tinds the support or
fellow international Student's Organizar
tion (ISO) students helpful because
“they’re going through the same ieelings
of homesickness."

Like Faisal. Carole Saunders, an
Australian citizen who has lived in Lae.
Papua New Guinea since she was two, at
tended an International school, The
school’s students included many
Americans among the various na»
tionalities, but Carole says she thought oi
them as friends, not “Americans." “I first
came into Contact with what I thought
were real Americans when I was on vaca»
tion in Hawaii and the struck me as either
very rat or thin, lou , and rather ugly,"
ner rirst impressions of Americans have
changed since she arrived in the Midwest.
“People here are really kind and affecV
tionate and I like that. However
Australians aren't too physically
demonstrative and the touching took some
time to get used to.”

The social differences between her
hometown and Grinnell are striking.
Carole says that in Lae, the native Papuan
women are second to pigs in the culture as
a man’s wealth is guaged by the number of
pigs he owns. Men also buy their wives.
