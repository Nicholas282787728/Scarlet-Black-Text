Hello Grinnellians! ! You know what the
sports is; now you're going to heal- — the
Worst of the Story.

Every region in our country has a set oi '

cultural characteristics which help to this
ferentiate it from every other region.
These traits extend to nearly every facet of
life, including sports and leisure activities.
Being from a small, western Nebraska

community which bills itself the “Cowboy

Capital”, you might guess (and correctly
50) that i ve been treated to a wide variety
of uh, different forms of lecreation

One little-known, though popular, sport
'is "cowchip" throwing. These items are
thrown for distance, regardless of techni-
que. Sure, it Sounds simple, but not just
any 01’ chip will do! Contestants must
select a chip of suitable size shape, color,
aerodynamicity, and solidity in order to
achieve maximum throwing power

Other events involve the ever-present
chewing tobacco. These unisex contests in-
clude spitting for distance, spitting for ac—
curacy, “How many pinches—between-the—
cheek- and gum can you fit?" games and
“How fast can you make a circle' in your
pocket appear?" events.

Still another activity with which some of‘
you may be familiar is CRUISING. an en-
durance event which entails driving up
and down ~“Main” for grueling hours until
only one car remains 7 usually in an in-
tersection without gas.

Some traits were determined by popula-
tion, something we generally lacked.
Though my high school played 11-man
football. the majority of schools in ﬁle area
fielded 8- or G-man teams. Also, lewer peo
ple meant fewer sports ottered.

Needless to say, I currently know little
about sports such as soccer, swimming,
tennis, golf, and rugby, but in the “liberal“
spirit or Grinnell, rm going to try to ex-
pand my sports consciousness through this
position We'll just let the chips fall where
they may.

The Pack
is Back

By Justin Lincoln
If you overhear any members oi the
mens cross country team talking about
“packing,” dont assume that they are
leavmg campus or discussing various
brands oi sardines. They re merely
discussing a manner of running.

According to Coach Will Freeman, pack-
ing involves keeping as many runners as
possible together ior as long a time as
possible. And Freeman and team
members alike are looking at “packing to
literally keep them together on their quest
tor their first conference title since 1960

00- -captain Dave Wisdom said ”This
team concept is really just an elaborate
phrase for helping each other " Dave says
the packing technique enables all runners,
though especially the slower ones, to “run
faster farther without noticing it. " In ad
dition, the packing can force some of the
faster runners who chronically start too
fast to more even pacing throughout the
race. The moral support that packing
lends runners is invaluable as well.

Grinnell sports 23 returning harriers this
season, including the top 15 runners irom
last year's team, which linished 2nd to
Lawrence in the conrerence meet. Among
these are seniors Steve Harrold, Phil
Lefebvre, and Wisdom, juniors Steve
Piper, Steve Preus, and co—captain Anv

rdrew McKean, and sophomores Greg
Evans and Jim Duncan. Several outstan»
ding freshmen additions include Rich
Blegen, John Elmore, Nick Hopley, Kent
Koth, and Jonathon Lave.

The Pioneers {Purple Roos) experience
their first taste of competition in a dual
:neet versus conference rival Cornell here
tomorrow.
