and students would be allowed to bring
nonprescription drugs irom the Health
Center and any prescription drugs they
may need.

vide transportation to the hospital The
cost tor new system would be covered by
the health lee. According tn Tedernlall. the
health t‘ee currently does not cover the
total cost of running the Health Center and
the “share program" with the hospital
could save the college 34.000 to $5.000

liability. The Health Center would operate
as it does currently. with the exception
tllat there would be no overnight patients

The Pub Board has decided to close the
Pub next year so that space will be
available Members at Student Aiiairs are
considering tearing down a portion ol the
wall separating the Pub and Gardner, This
minor renovation would increase the iloor
space oi Gardner Lounge so that it could
be used ior allrcanlpus parties,

Pub Board have said that the Pub has been
losing money tor the last two years, with
the drinking age set at 21. the cstabllshs
