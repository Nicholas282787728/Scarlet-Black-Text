Drake said. “The trustees believe that
they are not experts on South Airica or
South African investments and that the
Board was losing sight oi its purpose.”

Sources close to the trustees said that in
particular. trustees James bowry and
Donald Stewart expressed their doubts
about whether the divestment policy was
of any use Sources report that Donald
Stewart recen|ly Visited South Africa and
has become skeptical about the eiiec-

At the same time, the Board decided not
to boycott Ford products and hit the cur-
rent ban on MGM/UA him along with
planned review oi the Board’s policy oi
divestment at the next Board meeting this
November.

The divestment decision was based upon
the recommendation oi the Board’s In»
vestor Responsibility Committee. The in-
vestor Responsibility Committee, which is
comprised oi Trustees Fred Little, John
Price, Donald Stewart and Gardiner Dutr
ton, Andrew Loweli and three students.
recommended that the Board divest irom
iive companies at a total value oi over so

million dollars, The five companies named'

ior divestment were Ford Motor Com»
pany. Exxon, IBM, PNC Financial and
U.S. Steel.

These companies were named based on
the Board's May 1985 resolution which
stated that the Board divest from com»
patties that did not sign the Sullivan Ac-
cords or provide strategic or military sup-
port ior the system oi Apartheid.

Alter reviewing the divestment pro~
posal, the Board voted to only divest irom
Ford. President Drake Said in a public
statement, “This action with respect to the
sale oi Ford Motor Company holdings ex-
presses our proiound disagreement with
the Apartheid policy oi the government oi
South Africa."

The trustees also passes a motion to
review the policy of divestment at the
Board's next fall meeting in mid-
November in Grinnell Drake said, “The
trustees decided to reassess the current
policy ior a variety oi reasons.” Drake
said that at the Board's winter meeting in
January, the trustees expressed a growing
feeling that they were spending too much

Nevertheless, the policy oidivestment is
to be reviewed by the board during its next
iall meeting.

Phil Cantor, a member or the Students to
End Apartheid and a member oi the In
vestor Reponsibility Committee said, “I
was very surprised by the Boards's
move... it appears as though they are try-
ing to back out oi the May 1985 divestment
resolution.

Cantor went on to say. “We don’t think
the Board is acting in good iaith. It's the
students who have been spending all the
time trying to iigure it out. We're the ones
who have been writing all the companies,
getting all the iniormation and the annual
reports, and writing back ior all the addi-
tional information, Cantor said, “We've
lived up to our end or the bargain and the
trustees have decided they don’t have to
live up to their part.”

on the issue oi trustee's time problem
with divestment. Cantor said, “If the
trustees agree to divest, it should be no
problem. Just iigure out it it does or does
not fit the terms of the May 1985
resolution." Cantor stressed, “The
trustees’ decision making process is at
iault ior taking up too much time.”

President Drake said that the May 1985
resolution states that the policy oi divest-
ment “shall be judiciously administered"
and the board is taking those words into
account Drake said. “The trustees want to
see it divestment is a good policy and iS it
oi any worth."

Here too, the Board took another con-
troversial decision in voting not to boycott
products from Ford In the May 1985
resolution. the trustees state, "The college
will reirain irom purchasing products and

by John Harrison

As he prepared to leave ior his new post
in lllinois. outgoing Minority Aiiairs
Director Quentin Johnson this week cited
iamily considerations as the prime
motivation ior his decision to resign

in January, Johnson unexpectedly
resigned and steve Jones a resident hall
adviser iv elected to replace Johnson as
the Dircct oi Minority Aiiairs

This neck Johnson inihrmed a Scarlet
and black reporter that ttie reasons lor his
teat mg Griiinell were "u result oi the pro-

.ltlhnsoii said 'They were coming home

asking questions why their hair was diir

term! from the olher children they knew " '

Johnson explained that his Children were
at the ztge tthen they want to be like other
people. He said his children were having
great diliiculty being different. "My kids
need to know that it is O.K. to be black,”

He Stressed that “My children's pros
blcms are not due to racism or
maliciousncss on the part of the children in
the school. He said. “My children have had
a lot oi support irom school teachers and
administrators ”

But he added, “My children really need
to grow up in a more culturally balanced
environment."

He said that he hoped to find that balanc-
ed environment in his new home. He plans
to move to the Chicago area when he
assumes his new position as the Assistant
Dean ot Students at Lake Forest College.

Johnson described his two year tenure
as Minority Affairs Director as “very
beneficial." He said he believes that Grin-
nell College and its administration are
dedicated to a racially diversified campus.

But Johnson stressed that if Grinnetl is
to be a diverse campus, all parts oi the
campus must be committed, “The college
has made an outstanding eiiort to racial
diversity that it is beginning to be com-
municated at all levels," he said.

Johnson Said some Di the immediate
results oi the administration’s commit
ment are being seen right now in the ap-
pointment of a black recruitment officer in
the admissions office and the institution of
the Black Scholar and Professional in
Residence Program.

Astor the controversial Afr0~Amerlcan
Literature proiessorship that has remain
ed unfilled for more than a year, Johnson
said that the college had oiiered the posi-
tion to two Candidates who both turned the
job down. He stressed that the college “did
make a Strong linancial eiiort" to fill the
Aim-American position. As it stands noiv,
tlle Board of Trustees has decided to leave
the position open ior the iollowing year so
that a lull search can be conducted.

Concerning the destre {or more black
faculty Ell Grinnell, Johnson said. “There
is more to getting a minority professor
than just hiring someone " Johnson added.

Outgoing nnnoriiy .iiinirs director
Quentin Johnston .

"We must think long term in order to get
. more minority iaciilty members."

Johnson stated that too often students
really do not see the commitment that the
school has to a racially diverse campus.
Johnson said. "The trustees sincerely are
interested in what's going on and willing to
makr 9 Commitment to a diverse
campus,”

Johnson said that he knew of many col»
lege boards oi trustees who do not even
meet with their minority all ' directors.

On the issue of racial Sensitivity at Gr -
nell. Johnson Said “the level of sensitivity
is good but it could get much better.” He
said that next. year, the new Minority Af-
iairs Director, Steve Jones, will
strengthen the eiiort to bring cultural pro-
grams to the dorms.

Yet. Johnson stated that there is a dif-
licult situation for the black student at
Grinnell, Johnson Said. “Being a black stu~
dent at Grinneli is not getting any easier,"
Johnson added, “For blacks at Grinnell,
there are very iew options ior cultural ex»
change and this has a great eiieet on
academic motivation.” Johnson pointed
out that there are only 55 black students at
Grinnell and this greatly limits the
number oi people to whom you can have
cultural ties,"

Johnson also pointed out that there is a
271 black female to black male ratio on this
campus that greatly eiiects black
students‘ socxal life. Yet he said that the
black female to black male ratio is not
isolated to Grinnell but is a national
phenomena that exists at almost all col-
leges

“Leaving Grinnell is a hard decision. in
terms of professionalism, there is not a
better school than Gl'innell College," said
Johnson "I'm very indebted to the college
ior making me stronger proiessional. I
believe that Grinnell is one of the best Col-
leges in the country and i know that in live
years that Grinnetl will be a more diverse
campus, But ioi- right now, 1 want my
family to be comfortable."
