The Human Element

With times as serious as they are and
with everyone's attention focused on the
ever-increasing number of terrorists in the
world, Ifind myself inexplicably drawn to
the less whimsical aspects oi my lire. I’m
losing my eye, my appreciation ior the
pleasant things that have happened in re
cent days — snow in April, mediocre
grades, room draw, the slight miscalcula-
tion while gingerly stepping out oi the
shower stark dripping naked .. .

I've been told a number of times. ”Hey,
you oughta try writing about something
serious." .

“You mean important?” lask, trying to
look perplexed. ”Something that aiiects
myself. the people around me, and the
world?"

“Yeah!"
thusiastically

Life is not all goodness and light. There
is evil in the world. Wicked and cruel peo-

And then there's the really frightening

thing. the one that strikes home * that the

damnable wrong to be found in the world is
part oi me, too, The skeletons in my closet
have been rattling to escape for too long,
and they must be let out. Oh, how it
shames me to admit this!

I confess. I was once a terrorist. This is
my story.

The illtecn of us were of diverse
backgrounds and pursued a variety oi in
terests 7 hence the name Random House.
We were largely unused to the others'
idiosyncrasies ~ that is until mid-
semcster. Then we knew. and all too well.

Matt had iirst appeared to us as a
reserved, wellrdressed, studious fellow.
His controlled actions and cool exterior
presented to us the picture of a careful
thinker bent on success. He was serious,
and by all that we could see, emotionally
stable as well Then. three weeks into the
semester, the man lost his composure. The
guy went totally bonkers, utterly nuts

Bananas,

It was his B—day or something. I don't
know. it doesn't really matter, Anyway, he
got a present from a iriend, a stuiied teddy
bear named F. Scott. It was cute. but no
big deal.

Here was a kinda stocky, clean-shaven.
preppy conservative with ilaming red,
curly hair, with a bear. And we iigured it
to sit, with its v»neck sweater, parachute
pants. and factoryrsewrl grin, on the

bookshelf next to Plato‘s. Dialogues. it was
mildly humorous, but ni, hig deal.

Then, he began to talk about it. At
breakfast. At lunch. At dinner. Fondly. It
was sorta strange, but no big deal,

Some time went by, and i began to see
him walking around campus with a big,
dumb smile pasted across his face. Just
like his bear, which by now he toted
everywhere around the house with him. He
talked of raising it like a child. At
breakfast, At lunch. At dinner. It was
somewhat irritating

He wrote to the parents of a friend of his
back home. A certan Dr, Crowder.

F Scott‘s official dental records arrived
a week later

Matt began compiling pictures or bears
tiamily photographst and started shopp»
ing for clothes, “F, Scott did this" and “F,
Scott did that" began to take its toll on my
sanity. At breakfast. At lunch. At dinner. It
was maddening.

I began to scheme

Then, when he wasn't quite paying close
enough attention to the furry little beast, I
acted

l beai'napped F. Scott, blindiolded him,
trussed his paws. and set him way back in
the top of my closet ior the moths to chew
Then I sent. a ransom note,

Matt was amused, until he had to sleep
alone that night.

I sent the second ransom note. and Matt

started to sweat He interrogated, begged
and threatened. No one seemed to know
anything. l-lis spirits no longer bubbled and
he became moody I". Scott became the
major topic oi conversation ior everyone
even remotely connected with the house.

Matt's depression started making him
difficult to live with. Other house reSldents
were becoming worried about Matt's state
of mind, and they discussed it endlessly. At
breakfast. At lunch. At dinner.

I grew unsure about my recent decision
to buy a duplicate bear and‘send it piece by
piece through campus mail, ,

Meanwhile Matt had resorted to tacking
up “WANTED" notices around the house,

My internal struggles with my cons»
cience raged on. People began accusing
me, though ldenied everything,

My conscience iinally won. The bear was
returned, and the threats to bomb my
room were dropped. My reign of terror
was ended.

Since then, F, Scott has gotten braces
and is now wearing Cabbage Patch
clothes. including a fullrlength bunny suit
and a pirate outfit. which Matt calls the
“Long John Silver" suit.

I had thought that myvblood was rid of
the violence, Then it showed a low days
back.

i reminded me oi the spongy white in-
sides of a million exploded teddy bears,

And it is the season for terrorism
