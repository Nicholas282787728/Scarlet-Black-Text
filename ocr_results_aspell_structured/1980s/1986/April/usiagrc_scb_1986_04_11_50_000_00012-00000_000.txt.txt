elrSadat. and Israel's Menachem Begin,
the Camp David Accords and an israeli-
Egyptian peace treaty were signed in
1W8-79.

The spirit of Camp David. however. has
not spread. Both Syria and Jordan have
yet to sign a peace accord that concludes
the Seven Day War. The Israelis at the
same time, have made few advances
towards granting some torm oi autonomy
to the West Bank and Gaza ~ an important
part oi the spirit of Camp David. The
Israeli expulsion of the PLO from Lebanon
did not stabilize israel‘s northern flank
and may have served the Palestinian
cause through an improvement of interna
tional opinion,

The present status of the Aratrlsraeli
peace process can he described as, at best.
stalled. The most recent peace initiative
showed the most promise toward achievng
a successful resolution of the conflict. Unr
fortunately, the initiative collapsed.

King Hussein of Jordan was able to
broker a deal in which it looked as if the
PLO would recognize UN Res. 242 and the
Israeli government would sit at the same
negotiating table as PLO leader Yasser
Arafat. The U.S. government granted
several important concessions to the
moderate Arab initiative:

1. The U.S. and (hopefully) Israel would
participate in the Arab iormat or an inter-
national peace conference which might in
clude the Soviet Union,

2. The PLO would be invited to attend,

3. The FLO would ask for self-
determination on the West Bank and Gaza,

4. The US. and Israel would open a
dialogue with the FLO immediately.

Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
seemed to be willing to risk the stability of
his governing coalition and his own
political iuture by meeting with the PLO.
It appeared as though a deal would be cut
that. granted some autonomy to the oer
cupied territories while the mainstream
(Arafat's Fatah faction) PLO would
recognize UN Res. 242.

For reasons that are not clear, Arafat
suddenly broke with Hussein and backed
out of an agreement that he had never ex»
plicitly acknowledged, Hussein’s personal
credibility took a major blow (at the same
time a U5 Jordanian arms deal was fail-
ing in the U.S. Congress). Peres cautiously
back-tracked and U.S. officials began
what they called “a total re-evaluation of
policy,”

While a period of reflection may be
helpiul to all the parties involved, any
stability that now exists is a temporary
phenomenon. The Arabs must act because
the Israelis continue to consolidate their
control over the West Bank and Gaza. The
Israelis on the other hand. are faced with a
crisis of democracy in determining
whether the substantial Arab populations
in the occupied territories have rights as
Israeli citizens. Continued occupation is
also a burden on the recuperating but
[ragile Israeli economy.

Aratat, as always, is challenged from his
own ranks. If Arafat or his Fatah faction
were to lose inﬂuence in the PLO, a new
and potentially more radical represen-
tative of the Palestinian cause might
emerge (eg. Syria).

Shimon Peres. In particular, faces a uni-
que opportunity. l-lis Labor party's conser»
vative coalition partner, the Likud Bloc, is
presently suffering from internal conilict.
Under a coalition agreement, Peres IS to
turn the office of Prime Minister over to
Likud’s Yitzhak Shamlr in October
Forces in Shamir's Herut party (in th
forms of David Levy and Ariel Sharon) are
moving to replace Shamir with Levy. This
split in the conservative ranks has
strengthened Peres’ hand and may allow
him the possibility oi constructing a coali-
tion that excludes his Likud partnersl
Without Likud interference. Peres would
have more flexibility to come to a
diplomatic agreement with the Arabs?

These developments necessitate im-
mediate diplomatic solutions. King Hus-
sein is a moderate Arab who is Willing to
make concessions [or peace. Shimon Peres
and his Labor party seem to be the only
possibility for achieving flexibility on the
Israeli side. Yasser Arafat, although dire
ficult to deal with. is probably more

real road to peace and the end of terrorism
lies in the resolution of the Palestinian pro-
blems, Supporting israeli militarily is like
putting a bigger police force in our inner
cities. without improving the schools,
resolving the housing problems, reducing
the level of unemployment, and working to
improve the attitudes of the'troubled peo-
ple in such areas. Increased force does not
address the problem. and will notsolve the
problem.

There are two sides to any conflict, both
of which share the blame, and both of
which together. must receive it. Taking
sides in such a conflict makes us a part of
it, and does nothing to resolve the problem
of violence, To resolve the conflict in the
Middle East, the United States must play
the role of mediator. If we act in any other
capacity. we will never solve the problem;
it we continue to act the way we do now,
the problem for the people oi the Middle
East will not only get worse. The problem
tor the people of the United States will get
worse because the United States is
presently acting Violently in the Middle
East. And violence only begets more
violence.
