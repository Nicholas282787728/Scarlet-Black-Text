September 4th saw the beginning of a
series of [ilms “directed by John Ford”. a
phrase which for fifty years has insured
financial success at the box-ofﬁce Those
who know Ford primarily as a director oi
cavalry and lndian pictures may find this
success difficult to understand if they do
not know that his work is among the most
analyzed in iilm. Expressionistic, syms
bolic. and mylhic, the films are regularly
the subject of study in classes at major
film schools, while, at the same time, they
appeal to casual Viewers,

The Ford westerns. as a group, are said
to depict and distill the panorama at
developing America like those 01 no other
director. Ford's Work is consistantly
centered on the American family, actual
or symbolic — extended often to a cavalry
or warring unit. a navy crew, or, as in
"Stagecoach", to a closeknit group of
travelers or settlers drawn together by cirs
cumstance. In some of the films, the
“Family's" problems are Compatible with
the larger society; in others the
“family's" struggle comes into conflict
with the larger societal structure.
Sometimes in these films, the conﬂict bet-
ween family and society is so great that
the family suffers irreparable damage. in
“The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” for
example, the makeshift family, together
with the setting which spawned it, is
destroyed. 0n the other hand, “Drums
Along the Mohawk,” an earlier film based
on the Edmond’s novel, presents
characters in harmony with societal objec-
tives. '

cinema with such films as ”Stagecoach".

working in the genre that he loved, he

critic Joseph McBaine,.“became a great
national storyteller".

Extending his concept of ”family” oft

summarized his contribution to American
iilm, saying, “John Ford is recognized as

A Streetcar

Named

By Kate Worster

This weekend's classic film is Elia
Kazan's A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)
starring Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh
Adapted from Tennessee Williams' prize-
winning play, the tilm received nine
academy award nominations and three
Oscars

Vivien Leigh was awarded an Oscar for
her poignant portrayal of Blanche DeBois,
a southern widow trying to live the refined
life of her childhood despite the reality of
her past. At the start oi the ﬁlm, Blanche
arrives at her sister's home in New
Orleans seeking some kind at escape from
reality. She finds instead her sister’s hus»
band who is a constant reminder of the
brutality in modern society.

Stanley Kowalski. Blanche's brother-in-
law, is one oi Marlon Brando’s best
remembered characters (Brando also pors
trayed Stanley in the New York stage pro-
duction). Stanley is a primitive man whose
animalistic qualities are frightening even
from the screen. Brando, known for grun-
ting lines such as “Wassa mattah which
you" (Kazan’s On the Waterfront), does it
agin in this ﬁlm. The most famous single
line in this film is Stanley’s cry for
“Stella”.

Desire

Kim Hutner and Karl Maiden (also
known as Lieutenant Stone on The Streets
of Sanrranciscoi are excellent as Stella,
Blanche's sister, and Mitch, the man who
tries to befriend Blanche. Both perfor-
mances won bestsupporting Oscars,

A Streetcar Named Desire had several
diiliculties with, the Hollywood censors.
The taboos in this ﬁlm included the
homosexuality ol Blanche’s dead husband,
Blanche's alleged affair with a teenage
boy, and Stanley‘s rape of Blanche Text
changes and blackouts were used effec-
tively without completely destroying the
Viewer's. understanding of Blanche‘s
character.

The ﬁlm is most often criticized for her
iiig too theatrical, both in Kazan's direc-
tion and in the acting styles of Leigh and
Brando. The music and photography,
however,, add positively to the film,
especially in the more controversial
scenes, For example, the shots of the drip-
ping rain and the sight 0! Blanche’s lace in
the cracked mirror during the rape scene
are particularly effective
