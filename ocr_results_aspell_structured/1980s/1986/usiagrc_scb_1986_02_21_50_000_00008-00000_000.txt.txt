To the Editor:

Jim Duncan's “The Human Element"
columns have provided me with many
minutes of laughter and yes, even
nostalgia. However, l've been mildly
disturbed that the content of both of his col-
umns to date have dealt with toiletry. l
sincerely hope the man does not have a
(etidly fecal fetish and has, by this time,
flushed the topic from his arsenal. _

The Making of Orestes

by Beth Caldwell

“That’s me! 'l whispered Frank Bechter
(alias Fylades) to me as a eunuch slave
expounded (in pigeon Greek) upon
Pylades' conspiracy with Electra and
Orestes to kill Hclen oi Troy.

This scene epitomizes the great contrast
found in Grinnell's production of Orestes:
Euripedes' ironic tragedy alongside the
actors happy enthusiasm about the show,

Theatre professor Ellen Mease, director
of the show, went to Greece last fall to
study Greek drama in performance and
visit major archeologicai sites. Mease‘
characterizes Orestes as an ironic. unor-
thodax, unconventional play which
“radically" undercuts traditional
treatments of the Orestes legend“.

This fifth century rendering of the Greek
myth begins after Orestes (Glenn Martin)
has already committed matricide, avengr
ing his mother’s infidelity and murder oi
his father. Electra (Brenda Jensen) is
Orestes' sister and an accomplice in the
murder. As the play begins, Electra is ten-
ding to Orestes, who is tormented by his
conscience, driven mad by iuries, and hor-
rified by the thought of their imminent ex-
ecution by the townspeople for their crime,

Orestes pleads for help from Menelaus
(Rich Beck) and Tyndareus (Rob
Valenti), his relatives. But it is his friend
Fylades- (Frank Bechter) who comes up
with a solution. Bechter characterizes
Pylades as filled with anger, but more im-

portantly, as one who finds solutions to his
problems — “He controls the situation,
rather than letting thc situation control
him,”

“I’d like to be lhatway", Bechtcr added.

But Fylades’ first plan fails, so he makes
two rather shocking propositions. First, he
wants to die with Orestes and Electra Se
cond, it they are to die, he wants Menclaus
(who gave uiein no help) to pay. So they
plan to murder Helen (Brenda Hill),
Menelaus’ wife, Then Electra suggests
they also take Menelaus' daughter (Tracy
Zelllch) hostage, so as to persuade
Menolaus that he does want to help them.
All is finally solved by Apollo (Byron is
Ricks. body Jan Czechowski, voice).

During all of this, a chorus (Jessica
Thebus, Stephanie Heller, and Jennifer
Sultz) seems to chide and play with tradi-
tional Greek drama. Another play off of
tradition is captured in the appearance of
a eunuch slave (Scott Halloran) at a very
unpredictable moment in the play.

Cast enthusiasm is exemplified by Mar-
tin's “it's fun . . . there’s not much I’d
rather be doing” and Bechter's “Everyone
is putting their all into this.”

John Vincent, student setrand lighting
designer, found his end of the production
“challenging and lime-intensive”. Vina
Cent’s technical theatre background is ex
tensive, his designing career beginning
with a high school set for Tom Sawyer.

This was followed by an internship at the
Denver Center Theatre Company working
in the Production Manager’s ofiice and
work at Bonﬁls (another penver theatre)
as stage manager and carpenter. Finally,
Vincent designed the set for Tom Stop
pard’s play A Separate Peace which he
also directed — last semester at Grinnell.

To design the set and fighting for
Orestes, Vincent read the play many
times, looking at the script very different-
ly from how he would as an actor or direCr
tor As a designer, “you look for the
overall mood and message", he says. Vina
cent and Mease discussed many design
concepts. Even after the set was con-
structed, they made additional alterations
together. “Theatre at its best is a col-
laborative process.” according to Vincent.

Orestes will be performed Jn Arena
Theatre because the Dance troup will be
using Roberts. But neither cast nor direc»
tor seem to mind 7 in fact, they seem to
like the space. According to Mease,
“Arena is the best place for psychological
realism [and] expression is so close to
the audience 7 and that's great because
this is a very passionate play.”

Monday night Bechter reflected upon the
production, saying, “il 1 go back about one
hundred thousand years, Euripides is
writing Orestes; ii I go forward one week.
we are performing it," And so they are,
