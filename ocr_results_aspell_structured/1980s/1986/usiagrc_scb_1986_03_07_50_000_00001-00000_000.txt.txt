Computers t0 Occupy Health Center

Rushed Deeision Stirs Controversy

by John Harrison

At the end of this semester, die college
will begin to convert the North wing of the
Yonker Health Center into a computer tern
minai facility. The Computer Services Of-
[ice has for several weeks been looking for
room on campus to house Rainbow com-
puters due to the loss of space at the Noyce
terminal room

Because of the need to increase the air
conditioning space tor newly purchased
addition to the College's main frame com-
puter, Jim Tederman, Dean of Student Af-
fairs, and Waldo Walker, Vice President of
the College, decided that the campus needs
to move all terminals out of the Noyce ter-
minal room and into another facility. After
considering a number of possibilities,
Tederman and Walker decided that the
Healﬂl Center was the least used and most
available location to house the Rainbow
terminals.

.ln a meeting of the SGA Wednesday,
Walker stressed that the Rainbow Ter~
minals are much more prone to theft and
thus require tighter security. He also ems
phasized that there would be 24 hour~a>day
access to the Rainbow computers it the
terminals were put in the Health Center.
Walker asserted that the ideal computcr
access ratio, fora college like Grinnell, ls
five students per terminal; the current
ratio is nineteen to one.

Walker also Said that with the Health
Center renovation, the college would
“make two buildings out of the Health
Center”. Walker said that air conditioning
would most likely be installed in a portion
of the Health Center. Walker indicated
that the computer wing ot the Health
Center would most likely be the air condi-
tioned section.

Tederman also spoke at that same
meeting of the SGA and said that the Ad—
ministration did not adequately inform the
student body on the Health Center issue.
He said, “I admit that we (the administra-
tion) have not done a good job in com~

rounkcr Memorial Health Center. the site oi the proposed terminal room.

What perhaps most disturbed students
at the SGA meeting was the administrar
tion's plan to begin Hus renovation over
spring break. Tederman explained that
the administration acted in such a rushed
fashion because they were told by com-
puter experts that ii air conditioning was
not immediately improved in the Noyce
Computer Center that the entire system
could overheat and crash.

Tederman said that, “Time sequences
forced the administration to make quick
decisions and this was the reason that
students had not been informed.” Teder-
man went on to stress, “usually, we try to
receive student input."

Yet, what became known was that the
administration discovered the option of
temporary air condimning units and con-
sequently has delayed the Health Center
construction until this summer.

City Plans New Airport

by Jill Ellis

The city of Grinnell may soon have its
very own airport, complete with hangars
and a paved runway.

Grinnell does have an airport — of sors
— right now: a grass strip on the south end
of town, with a telephone nearby. it is
therefore not surprising, as Mayor Bob
Anderson explained, that of the 99 counties
in Iowa, Poweshiek county ranks "99th in
terms of airport quality."

If everything goes according to plan,
construction work for the new airport will
start this summer with the grading of the
land. Paving will take place during the
following summer, and the project will be
completed, and the first plane able to land,
by the fall of 1987.

The proposed airport site is a large field
located in between the Miraco corporation
building and the Wes Finch Chevrolet-
Oldsmobile dealership on Highway 146.
Plans tor the airport include an access

road connecting the airport to Highway
146, a runway running northwest to south-
east, and three hangars, one of which
would contain a terminal area “of 5mm,"
according to City Manager Ted Clausen.

Only small corporate planes and jets
could land at Grinnell’s proposed airport
— certainly no commercial flights could
fly in or out for quite awhile.

The estimated total cost for me airport is
$1.6 million. Approximately $300,000 has
been contributed by private corporations,
including GTE, thus tar. Clausen hopes
that state and federal grants will cover the
remaining costs. The project is thus com-
pletely dependent upon availability, hop
ing that the iederal government will pay
90% of the costs for land purchase and pav»
ing, and the state government will pay 70%
of the cost of grading.

Clausen hopes that the airport will help
attract new business and industry to Grins

Many students have been very
outspoken on the entire principle of taking
a wing of the Health Center and converting
it into computing facilities, Karin Nyhus,
member of the SGA Health Center Sub~
committee, explained that contrary to
many claims made by the administration,
the Health Center is very tight on space,
Nyhus pointed out that last semester there
were 57 patient days in the Health Center
and this semester there have already been
over 65 patient days. Nyhus says that the
Health Center Cannot afford the loss of
space caused by the proposed renovation.

Nyhus and other people close to the
Health Center Operation have expressed a
concern over the potential increase in
noise and activity that could be brought on
by putting a computer facility in the
Health Center. Yet Donna Bailey, Director
of the Health Center. said that her cons
Cerns about the installation of a computer
terminal iacility have been adequately ad-

dressed by the administration.

In fact, both Walker and Tederman
assured the SGA joint board that it would
indeed be possible to construct sound proof
walls to separate the Health Center from
the Computer terminal wing, Never-
theless, many students still expressed
their apprehension over the conversion ot
the Health Center, one student said, “It
just seems intuitively wrong to take a part
of the Health Center.and put in computer
terminals." ‘

Nyhus also said, “This is a result of a
hasty decision made without looking at
other alternatives." Nyhus asked, “Why
wasn't the new psychology building looked
at as a possible sight for terminals?” She
said, “Once the space in the Health Center
is gone, it is gone and can’t be retrieved.”

In a closely related issue, the ad-
ministration has disclosed that they are
looking into ending over-night care at the
Health Center and sending students in
need of over-night care to Grinnell General
Hospital, Tederman said the cost of sen-
ding someone to the out-patient care facili-
ty at Grinnell General would be half as
much as keeping a student in the College‘s
own Health Center.

Tederman said that he has been in con-
tact with officials at Grinnell General and
a deal is in the works for an outpatient
contract between the College and die
hospital. A further benefit to the out
patient care at Grinnell General is the Col-
lege's reduced legal liability with students
at the hospital rather than the Health
Center. Tederman said, “The College car-
ries an enormous liability with the Health
Center.,.and the College’s attorneys have
been looking for ways to reduce it.”

Yet Tederman emphasized that the
hospital out-patient system would be in
many ways no different than the way the
Health Center system currently works.

Construction is scheduled to begin by
this summer so the Health Center opera
tion will not be disrupted this semester and
the administration hopes to end overnight
care at the Health Center by next year.
