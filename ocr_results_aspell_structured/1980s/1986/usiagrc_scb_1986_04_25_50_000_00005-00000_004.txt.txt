an interview

According to Admissions director John
Hopkins tudcnts participating in the
‘Grinnell in Star Wars‘ program will aid in
conducting research to make today’s pipe
dreams tomorrow's death rays - oops;
that’s 'defensive deterrent.‘ ”

“We felt the continued existence 0! the

politicial science department would only
impede the lull fruition of this program,”
he said in a later interview.
- Department {unding including the
salaries of the former professors will be
put directly into the conversion of their old
offices and classrooms into SDI student
research centers. Work is currently under-
way to convert the office computers into
direct linkage with the Pentagon’s main-
frames.

The physics department has arranged
an onrcampus ICBM site in return for a
substantial Defense Department research
grant. sources inside the physics depart-
ment say.

To the unknowing eye of the average
prospective and Soviet spy satellites, the
Gale 0, Grant observatory appears to be
nothing more than a place to watch the
stars, According to Professor of Physics
Robert Cadmus, however, this fall the
observatory will be a iully operational site
[or a $70 million MX missile.

The MX housing was part of Grinnell
College’s hid submitted to the pentagon
for the SDI research contract. In return for
extensive funding for research for SDI —
lasers, particle beam weapons, and other
systems 7 the college agreed to house the
MX.

Students crit izing the deployment
claimed the silo’s presence makes Grins
nell a primary target for nuclear attack

“Actually, I feel that the site's ap-
pearance as an observatory greatly
reduces Grinnell’s prime target status,”
Cadmus said. “Besides, it’s time we took a
stand to aid our President's ﬁght against
the evil Pinko empire. The Bear is in ﬁle
woods, and this little baby is going to keep
him there! “

Cadmus, or “Cranium Bob” as he is call-
ed in official telexes to the Pentagon. was‘
tight-tipped as tar as spelling out the ace
tual research that is conducted on campus.

When asked if this was due to respect {or
national defense, he responded, “Hell, no!
If I were to tell you what we are really do
mg in the physics department, the next
thing rd know, some bleeding-heart
liberal would spring up out of the weeds
and try to launch balloons on my [rant
lawn."

Cranium Bob discounted any ethical or
professional conflict in housing the ten»
warhead ICBM.

“Are you kidding? The Mx is a
PEACEMAKER. It's a deterrent. It‘s time
Grinnellians woke up and smelled the
roses. The Nicaraguan Commies are a two
clays drive from Texas; the Cuban reds are
close enough to pickup Miami radio; and
the Russian students have taken over
Brown House}! The time to act against the
Soviet lapdogs is near, I‘m proud to be do:
ing my part.” "

When asked why he agreed to talk to the
5&3 rather than remain silent in View of
the proximity oi potential Soviet spies, he
replied, “I’m not worried I've got the en-
tire observatory wired, One lalse step and
KABLAM! Besides, no one reads this
paper anyway. "
