Issues and Perspectives

Education and Corporal Punishment

by Bruce Emond

In 1982. after living in the U.S. for
several months. I wrote an article for my
high school newspaper which compared
the American education system with that
of my British homeland. One of the major
difterences I wrote about. and the one
which elicited many responses of disbelief
from my American classmates. was that
England still had corporal punishment in
its schools. ..

Subsequentlegislation in England has
banned most toms of corporal punish
ment yet generations oi English students.
including mine. grew up in [ear oi the
“cane."

The cane (actually this was a. general
term which was applied to sticks. rods.
and riding crops). was meted out in only
the most serious cases of misbehalvor.
such as repeated truancy and abusive
language. An order to “Go and see the
headmaster" would invariably culminate
in several strokes of the cane to one's
backside or hand. i

For minor disobedience. a ruler was
often used to discipline the student A
teacher was entitled to hit the student at
his own discretion without having to con-
sult the headmaster. I remember one in-
stance during my first year at secondary
school which for me exempliﬁed the futili-
ty of using corporal punishment. A
substitute teacher. who was extremely
nervous and the object at jokes and much
baiting. suddenly became so enraged at
one student that she beat him repeatedly
on his back When she eventually stopped.
she was distraught and in tears while the
student remained obstinate. quite unperr
turbed by her anger.

To understand how such a controversial
custom as corporal punishment could have
endured ior so many years (it was abolish-
ed in most European Economic Communi-
ty countries decades before) one must
understand the rigidity of the English
educational system. Corporal punishment
is just a throwback to the Victorian dogma
oi “spare the rod and spoil the child."
another remnant of the anachronistic
mindset and dogged upholding of tradir
tions which lorever stifles change in Brie
tain.

When I was at school in England the
educational rules and approach had pro-
bably changed marginally since my
mother attended school in the 1940’s.

Uniformity in all aspects of school life.
which was supposed to eliminate
discrimination on the basis of one’s
economic background. was considered
paramount. Students wore uniforms of
prescribed colors and designs; even in the
middle of winter female students were not
allowed to wear pants because they were
considered “unfeminine.” .

English Mindset:
“Spare the Rod, Spoil the Child”

Students had to study a set program oi
courses-usually Math. English, a ioreign
language. religious studies. history. and
some type of arts and cratts-whieh allow-
ed little variation and experimentation
Even the number and type of subjects to be
studied ior ‘0' and ‘A' level exams was
determined by teachers. not studens

‘For minor disobedience
a ruler was often used
to discipline the student.
A teacher was entitled
to bit the student at his

own discretion. . ’

This rigid adherence to traditional ap
proaches to education is reflected in the
relationship between teacher and student.
In England. the teacher is usually an aloof.
unapproachable iigure; the delineation oi
teacher as superior and the students as
subordinates is clear. At my school. it was
unknown tor a student to be treated with
and accorded respect from teachers.

In English schools there are from
masters iior each class) and the
equivalent or American home room
teachers, yet there are no counselors to of~
ier advice to students, .Consequently.
students learn that their Views are con-
sidered triiling and warrant scant regard.
I believe that the authoritarian structure
of the British educational system was a
major factor lalthough by no means the
only onei in the rebellious youth
movements of the late 1970's.

Corporal punishment was an unseemly
anomaly in these days ol liberal educa-
tlonal techniques. It persisted in England
as part of an established system which re
jected any proposed changes as “radical"
and potential threats to the traditional
status quo I have returned to England {or
briei vacations over the past [our years
and English society does indeed appear to
be undergoing changes. becoming
gradually less class-Stratified and not as
firmly rooted to “the traditional ways.”
Though the English still cling to some
anachronistic institutions tie the Royal
Family). I like to think that the end of core
poral punishment in English schools

heralded the emergence oi a progressive

approach to educating England's youth.

 

Stiident Recalls Corporal

Punishment in Ireland

by Nadia Abdel-Wahab

Shortly before Christmas of 1981. a
young boy‘ died in the county oi Sligo. in
Ireland. He died as a result of a beating
given to him by a teacher. The incident
sparked a heated debate in the Irish Dail
that eventually led to a landmark resolu-
tion. During Easter vacation of 1982. the
lrish government announced that corporal
punishment in Irish schools was to be
phased out by the end oi that school year.

I had been attending St. Oliver’s Na-
tional Primary School. in Ireland. for five
years when the announcement was made.
Beatings were a daily occurrence at our
schools. Students feared them. but ac
cepted them as part of their education. I
myself hated being hit by a teacher. but
never did anything about it. It would have
been too risky.

lrish primary schools serve as more
than just schools. They are also considered
the dlsciplinarian organ for Irish children.
This stems from the fact that Irish
families are very large (a girl in my class
had nine brothers and {our sisters) and
that parents don't have enough time to
deal with and discipline all their children.
(If you're wondering why lrish families
are so large. 1 should point out that. in
Ireland. contraceptives have only been
legally available since 1934.)

Parents didn't frown when a child came
home with red streaks across their hands
in tact. l oiten got the impression that
parents were glad that they didn't have to
hit their children . . . let the teachers do it!
In my six years or lrish education. 1 never
knew oi a parent ever complaining to
school authorities for child abuse,

The crimes punishable by hitting ranged
from failing to rise when an adult entered
the classroom to missing school without a
parental excuse. lwas nit live times: once
for failing to do an Gaelic‘ assignment.
twice for talking' in the absence of the
teacher. once [or getting a bad score on a
spelling assignment and once ior
misreading a sentence. The latter is the
one I remember most vividly so I'll use it

as an example.
It happened in third grade, Our teacher.

who doubled as our school‘s principal
tsomething that happened quite oiten
because of the ever present lack of
teachers in lrelandt. was called out unex-
pectedly in the middle of our English
reading class. Before leaving, he ap
pointed a girl as class monitor.

Class monitor was the most hated posi-
tion oi all. Students who were ordered to do
this had to report any incidences that oc-
curred to the teacher. Since the teacher
knew that something was bound to happen
in his absence. he could be sure of at least
one name from the monitor. If nothing
happened. the monitor would usually be
accused of covering up and would be
punished. anyway.

Our teacher left with instructions to read
out loud during his absence. In turn. each
student stood up ("straight back. ieet
together. one palm under each cover of the
book. read loudly. look up alter each
sentence . , ."7 and read three sentences.
Nervously. as usual, 1 awaited my turn.
Havmg figured out. in advance. what my
three sentences were to be. I had read
them quietly over and over again. The boy

to my leit twe always sat “boygirlrboyr
girl”! had erred on a name and had to re»
main standing.

1 stood up and began to read, Everything
went well we were reading a book entitled
"The Tara Brooch" 7 an Irish legend.
which 1 was enjoying considerably) until
me last sentence, it was: “They drove oil
the cattle and sheep in the direction oi the
bay."; 1 read: “They drove off the cattle
and THE sheep in the direction ol‘ the
bay.” 1 was ordered to remain standing. 1
knew what was coming, We all knew what
was coming.

Our teacher returned and began to inter-
rogate the monitor as to our crimes. He
told us to come up to the iront oi the
classroom and stand. racing the class. He

‘He drew his bamboo
stick out ofbis pocket

and ordered as to
extend our right bands,

then he took aim.
There was a loud,
cracking noise...’

lectured about the importance oi prepar~ .
ing our daily assignments and about the
importance oi honesty tin other words we
should have admitted these terrible errors
ourselves instead of having to be asked to
remain standing by the monitor. This
would have worked. if halfof us had realiz-
ed that we hadactually commited errors.t
one by one we were asked to step to
where our teacher was standing. He drew
his bamboo stick out of his coat pocket
l“Jack". the bamboo stick. measured
about 18 inches) and ordered us to extend
our right hands l"arm straight. at
shoulder height. palm up . . ."i. then he
took aim. There was a loud. racking noise
that made every one oi us jump The same
procedure was repeated with the leit hand.
We stood there. atterwards..hands press
ed to our sides. trying so hard to be brave
and not to cry. Red lines developed on our
hands while he gave us the “afterwards"
lecture/warning. Then we walked solemn-
ly to our desks and wrapped our hands

' around the cold. metal table legs.

There were no hard ieelings against the
monitor. Today it was her accusing you.
tomorow it was you accusing her. That
was just the way it was. We weren‘t really
a class. We were a bunch oi well-trained
sheep who quivered before the almighty
teacher.

We were lucky, though. Many students
at our school were taken into the
bathrooms and whacked with leather
belts: others were hit so many times on
each hand they could no longer keep their
arms straight, or their eyes dry.

Our most paradoxical moment was site
ting in Catechism class. reviewing the
chapter on Forgiveness. and hearing me
sobs of the school's tough guy driiting in
[mm the principals office. It was a
pathetic Sight to see that boy come back
