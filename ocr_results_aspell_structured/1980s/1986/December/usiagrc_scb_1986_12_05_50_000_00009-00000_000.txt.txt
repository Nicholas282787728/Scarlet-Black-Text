To the Editor:

The iront page article on the November
21 issue of the Scarlet and Black, “Letter
Apologizes for Homophobic Acts”, served
only to confirm what I had thought to be
true ior some time. The recentemphasis in
the s and B concerning the “rise ot
homophobia” appears to be another exam»
pie or a few people attempting to set the
agenda for entire campus community. For
two weeks Beth Johnson and RJ, Baker,
along with the editorial manipulation of
John Harrison, have shoved this issue
upon the Grinnell campus. Over and over.
again and again. we read Beth’s and R.J.'s
comments about recent threats and acts oi
homophobia directed against them. Why
does the s and B insist on quoting, almost
exclusively, these two individuals? If the
problem is of such importance to the came

S & B writer blasts editorial

Dear Editor.

As a writer for the Scarlet and Black I
am usually proud of the quality of the
newspaper. But recently something has
diminished that pride. The “First Annual
Turkey of the Year Awards” in the last
issue made me ashamed to be associated
with this paper. In an attempt to criticize
certain organizations all that was achiev-
ed was a perfect example ofself—critlcism,
The editorial writer took what had
previously been done to make the Scarlet
and Black a highly reputable, quality
newspaper and threw it all away. Not only

were most of the “awards" a display of the
amateurness of the statl but grouping all
of them together under one comedic title
was idiotic, On the tront page at that very
issue. homophobia was treated as the
serious subject that it should be. But on the
editorial page. where the opinion oi the
staff is supposedly being stated. it was
grouped with turkeys and mating slugs. i
think one gag issue was enough.

I only hope that this is not the start of a
trend. Let‘s leave the eighth grade style
journalism to the eighth graders. 7 James

Turkey Awards unconstructive

Dear Editor.

Your “Turkey of the Year Awards" cer-

Perhaps it's the idea itself that bothers
me. the “awards" being somewhat less
than glamorous and leaning a bit more
toward the asinine than I am accustomed

to seeing in the S and B. More likely a
reason for my concern though is that the

awards represent some very superficial.

tlnger~pointing going on in an attempt to
be funny. Most of the humor. however. is
lost in aspersion and while there well may
be things on this campus meretorious oi

superficial derision.

Grinnell’s honesty questioned

Dear Editor.

What do YOU think of when you think of
Grinnell? I think of a bunch of hard-
working individuals attempting to make it
in that “cruel World" by attaining as much
knowledge as they possible can, However,
as one of those individuals. I think of a cer»
tain attitude This attitude is one that I
have and one that is expected of all at
Grinnell. This attitude is expressed
throughout the campus, especially in the
liberal policy the administration at Grin»
nell Continues to uphold. Where else can
you borrow a set of golf clubs or cross
country skis, boom, and poles? The at-
titude I am alluding to in the past ex7
amples is that of trust. Trust, and thus
honesty. is something we all take for
granted at Grinnell. That is the very
reason I am writing this article. Diditever
occur to you that as soon as you leave tor
class with your door unlocked. as most or
us do, a fellow Grinnellian. familiar or un~
iamiliar. whom you trust could then pro»
ceed to permanently borrow your records,
tapes. cash. checks. etc? ‘— maybe
duplicate your keys so they can have per-
manent access to your belongings
whenever they get that urge?

Here's a more realistic example. It’s
winter and therefore its quite cold. That
means when one travels from Younker to
Cowles for dinner. one will probably wear
a coat of some type. However, where is
one to'place one's coat once one enters the
overheated dining hall? Sorry to say. but
one must hang one’s coat amongst the rest
and thus taketh the chance that thy coat be
stolenri Heaven forbid there be a wallet
and keys in the packets, This is one of the
many gambles we all take everyday. Most
of the time we win. but how about when we
lose? It only takes a few to ruin a good
thing and those few are out there. To my
knowledge, at least three people have had
cash stolen from their unlocked rooms; a
VHS Cassette, Romancing the Stone. was
taken from a Younker’s lounge; a jacket
with a wallet and keys in pockets is miss-
ing; $200 was taken from a checking ac
count with a stolen SHAZAM card; and
even a box of detergent has disappeared
irom the laundry room.

Grinnell has always been a haven for
me, Being from a concrete jungle where I
don’t dare leave my house unlocked. I en-
joy the luxury of leaving my door unlock-

Grinnellian stresses
importance of
food pantry

by Alex Dracobly

while many or us at Grinnell worry
about eating in excess. many people in the
environs of Grinnell do not even have a sufs
ficienl amount of food to guarantee a
healthy diet. Malnutrition is a growing
problem in Poweshiek County Since 1980,
the lowering oi the Federal poverty line,
the farm crisis. the general economic
Slump. and an increase in the number of
elderly citizens have all contributed to an
enormous increase in the number of
hungry people in our county According to
Art Thayer. director of the local Food Pans
try. the number of people who asked ior
assistance tripled from the spring of 1985
to the spring 1986. and this number con-
tinues to increase,

The Food Pantry is a primary source ot
help in the county for those in short»term
need of road. The Pantry supplies lood tor
four day periods on a simple request basis.
It is not envisioned as a longrterm source
for food. Rather, the Pantry is meant to fill
the needs of those who are experiencing a
temporary food shortage problem. This
situation might occur. tor example, during

assistance. during a period of cash-flow
problems, or because of the late arrival of
food stamps. The Pantry will make a

 

larger commitment in case of need. This
applies especially to those who tall bet
ween the cracks of federal assistance pro-
grams, However, the Pantry's first Come
mitment remains to those in need of the
more temporary assistance.

In the past year the Food Pantry has
served 1,700 persons and 500 families and
in the first three weeks of November it had
helped 28 families and 102 persons tthe
popoulation of the county is 19,000). In ad-
dition. the rural counterpart of the Pantry,
the Rural Pantry, provides food to bet»
ween SIX and eight families per week.
Young adults supporting small iamilies
make up the largest category of people
seeking assistance from the Food Pantry.
However, in the past couple oi years
greater numbers of farmers and elderly
citizens have also felt the pinch of

economic circumstances. Often these are

people who do not qualify tor iederal
benefits because of large farm assets. Also
feeling the strain are those retirees who
have lived longer than they had expected
and who had not anticipated current
medical and liVlng costs.

The Food Pantry is part oi Mid~Iowa
Community Action. an agency that IS in»
tended to help lowrincome persons live
more self-sufficient lives, The Pantry
receives 49% of its funding from the Corn
munity Services Block Grant. a federal
agency, on condition that the remainder of
its budget is raised from the local com-
munity. The local government. area chur-
ches. United Ways. and individuals all con-
tribute to help lurid the Food Pantry. Grin~
nell students will also have an opportunity
to help out disadvantaged persons. In
February the Grinnell College Mortar
Board will be sponsoring an all campus
foodsdrive to benefit the Food Bank. This
will be a great way to give a little help to
our hosts and neighbors in Poweshiek
County.
