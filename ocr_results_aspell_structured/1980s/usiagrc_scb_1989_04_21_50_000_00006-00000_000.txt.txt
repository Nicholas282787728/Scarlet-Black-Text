Student ponders
why people have
respect for others

To the editor:

I saw the movie Tarch Song
Trilogy last week. I laughed and
cried along with the other mem
bers of the audience, and when I
left. I took something with me.
I was raised by my parents to ac»
cept myself for what I am and
other people for what they are.

I was also taught to have re
spect for every human being
whom I meet, be they male. fe-
male, black, white, gay, straight,
Indian, whatever, because people
are, above all, people. I guess
acceptance goes along with re-
spect. Torch Song Trilogy was,
to me, a reinforcement of what
my parents taught me, and when
I walked out of that theater, I
knew that my parents had taught
me the right thing. But some-
thing else happened to me when I
walked out of that thwter; I
overheard a remark that doubtless
I and cenain other members of
the audience were meant to hear.
It was a disparaging remark about
sexual preference, directed at peo~

ple of my sexual orientation. It
cut me to the bone. After all, I
am what I am, and I know that I
will always be what I am. lac-
cept it. I expect others to accept
it. I respect myself. I expect
others to respect me. Yet there I
was walking out of a movie
which had as its message ac-
ceptfance] and respect, and some
body was so full of malice as to
direct such a remark at a certain
group of people. It made me any
gry, and it made me cry. I guess
that maybe some people’s parents
never taught them what my par»
ents taught me. and that it wasn't
their fault for making such a re»
mark out of ignorance. I don‘t
know. Maybe some people just
don’t want to understand: it's
easier to hate than to love, they
say, Again,ldon‘tknow.

Oh, yeah, maybe I should
add, I‘m a heterosexual, and the
person who made the offensive
remark was gay. Devani L.

Reader calls on homosexuals
to emphasize similarities

To the editor:

Correct me if I‘m wrong, but
when one boils down Mike
Kent's last “Against the Grain,"
he basically says, “I don‘t mind
homosexuals in general. I
merely view the homosexuals I
am aware of with distaste.” Such
a view is hardly liberal or accept-
ing but unfortunately such a view
is typical among the majority of
the American population, What
of it, then? Doesn‘t that simply
imply that gays and lesbians
must voice their outrage and
protest in order to push for social
change and acceptance? In my
view it does. As an outside
viewer I feel it prudent to point
out that just how one becomes
verbal and visible is of
paramount importance

Years ago, before the AIDS
scourge had become widespread. I
saw a televised report of a gay
pride parade in Texas. Picture if
you will men clad only in leather
briefs, smiling and waving to an
assembled crowd of grim—faced
Texans, A collection of Hare
Krishnas with shaven pates and
orange robes would not have
spawned such an intense reaction
from those assembled masses.
Though it sounds ridiculous,
soon after the march. black reli-
gious leaders joined the Ku Klux
Klan in loudly denouncing ho-
mosexuality.

My point is this: if homo»
scxuals wish to be more widely
accepted within this country. they

would be wise to emphasize the
similarities between themselves
and the American public at large
and downplay the existing differ—
ences. Images such as men
astride a ﬂoat in leather underwear
can’t help but to undermine the
gay-rights movement. When
speaking out for lesbian and gay
rights, one should wear
“business-type clothing" and call
attention to the American ideals
of freedom, equality. and the pur-
suit of happiness, Appearing
outlandish (i.e., going out in drag
and appearing shocked by heteror
sexuality) and protesting that one
lives in an overtly heterosexual
society will only serve to shoot
the gay-rights movement in the
foot, Jonathan Locke

Wodzinski responds to Kent column

To the editor.

The task at hand is challeng-
ing. How is one to write a letter
to the editor in response to Mike
Kent’s Pride Week column with-
out resorting to the faulty logic
and ad hominem attacks he ab-
hors? A letter such as the one
written to the S andB criticizing
Matt Macho's abortion column
simply would not do. (What?
Mike wrote that letter? Mike
Kent? Wrote an ad hominem at—
tack? Must be some other
Mike.)

How. indeed. is one to write a
letter that can match the logic of
statements such as “[TV, ads,
literature] are trying to appeal to
the most people they can, and
most people aren’t homosexual. .
.Most moviegoers will better re-
late to a heterosexual couple than
a homosexual one”? The logical
presupposition made here is that
one cannot under any circum-
stances “relate” to any demo-
graphic differencm. White people
can’t watch The Cosby Show
because it‘s about black people.
White males should never take a
Kesho Scott class; they wouldn‘t
be able to “relate" to it. Ameriv
cans probably shouldn’t even go
to Europe because they wouldn't
be able to “relate" to someone of
another nationality. Straight
people can't relate to Torch Sang
Trilogy, of course, since it’s
about gay men. I couldn’t agree
more.

The sheer logic of this one
paragraph alone overwhelmed me.
But this brilliance was surpassed

in the very next paraglaph. “I
know that if I were a heterosexual
living in a predominantly homo-
sexual society, I would be satis-
fied with being allowed to do
what I wanted in my bedroom."
The exquisite logic of saying that
what’s good enough for Mike
Kent in a hypothetical situation
should be good for millions of
people in a real situation is made,
if possible, even more powerful
when one stops to consider the
real situation Mike Kent is in.
Mike Kent is content to be a
