First campus-party debate,

draws mixed reviews

by l-‘lorti uinitr

The campus Republic
Democrat debate. held November
4, addressed toreign policy, the
economy and budget, and civil
rights to a crowded South Lounge,

ian McLean (foreign policyi.
Jim Gillespie (economy and
budget). and John Sbarbaro (Civil
rights) represented the
Republican Side while Ellen
Weinstock tioreign policy). Mike
Cleary (economy and budget).
and Mark Schumann (civil rights)
spoke for the Democrat side,
Wayne Moyer. Associate Pro-
fessor of Political Science
moderated the two hour event.

Though the election is history,
as is the campus debate, the
issues still remain hotly coir
tested. However. many tell that
this debate, which was to inform
students of the candidates posi»
tions and answer questions about
the issues, was a failure.

Many students felt the failure of
the debate rested on the can-
didates' representatives.

“The debate was mediocre,
wandering. and accomplished lit-
tle. It Wasn’t treated seriously
enough and. except ior lan's
presentation, was devoid oi
facts,” remarked David
Kopelman.

Tom Scott said he felt the same
way, "ll was interesting but didn’t
clarify things. Both sides had
some false information."

”Mark Schumann used humor
and illrplaced jokes to compensate
for his ignorance of the Subject,”
stated Todd Coulter.

"The rebuttals got too
personal," Robert Knowles
reﬂected.

Yet, others felt the debates fail-
ings rested with the audience.

“The questions the audience
asked were not questions. Rather

than strictly challenging the

representatives, people used it as
an opportunity tor a kind oi iloor
show." ilowena Rappaport said.

“At the end, the questions get a
little ridiculous.” David Mathias
agreed.

Jim Gillespie had a similar opi-
nion, “Few people went in with an
open mind. If they had looked and
thought there was another side it
would have been more wor-
thwhile. I apologize ior the waste
of time."

The predominantly Democratic
audience overwhelmingly telt the
Republicans won.

“The Republicans defended
Reagan’s policy more than the
Democrats defended Mondale's.
The, Republicans knew more
about the issues while the
Democrats were just emotional,"
stated Keri Hornbuckle.

“it wasn't a question of who
won, its a matter of who debated
better, as the ReDublicans did."
Mathias reflected.

“Overall, the Republicans were
more intormed and presented
iacts, whereas the Democrats just
expressed ideologies. and
repeated their ideas, a lot," Raps
paport commented. Some peer
ple, nonetheless, disagreed and
felt the debate was a worthwhile
experience.

“It was better than the regular
presidential debate,“ decided
Peter Metz.

"The student candidates
presented clearer views than the
actual candidates did. They are
far better debaters and probably
knew more than the actual can-
didates." added David Beavers.

Professor Wayne Moyer also
felt the students. both debating
and questioning. beneiited from
the debate,

“The debaters went to con-
siderable trouble in putting

» nout,"

together [heir presentations. 1
think they did clarify the issues
and even expressed their positions
more clearly than Reagan and
Mondale sometimes do.” said
Moyer.

“The questions were loaded
with civility. There was a sense oi
good feeling in the audience lvlas
very pleased with the student tur-
Moyer continued and add-
ed. “There was a certain excite-
ment during the debate. Neither
side let the other get away with
anything. Bill Mohrman {class of
1966) said to me afterwards that it
was very much like a congres-
sional debate."

The debate's main purpose ape
pears to have been to educate and
inform. rather than to add votes to
one or the other candidate. By
Sunday night. nearly every stu»
dent had decided on whom to vote
[or Attendance was for a large
part to satisiy curiosity and also
gave each student a chance to
plug his/her candidate.

“The debate wasn't going to
change anyone's mind on how to
vote, it was mainly to clarify the
issues and help the students
understand why and where the
candidates stood on the issues,”
said Mayer.

But the debate did change one
student’s mind on whom to vote
for.

"i plan to vote for Mike Cleary
and Mark Schumann as write-in
candidates tor the presidency and
vice presidency. The imposing
strength and solemnily of Mike
coupled with Mark's poweriui
command of the facts and keen
sense oi humour would produce a
progressive and enlightened style
or leadership which is desperately
needed in the White House. I urge
my tellow students to lollow suit.”
stated .loc Lal'occa.

it was a night of great satisfac-

those who watched the election

Young Republican party. descrio

Reagan virtually swept the nation

JB. to discuss

Democrat
sees no clear

mandate

by ltobcri 0, Quashie

The outcome of Tuesday's
presidential election was not a
mandate {rpm the people in favor
oi Reagan's conservative stances
on any at the issues. Professor
Robert Grey, Ph.D.. said that
night while giving his initial reac
tion to the poll predictions.

“Voters were reacting to the
contemporary state oi the
economy and may have given an
opinion on Reagan the man but it
certainly is not a mandate in sup
port at his policies." Grey said,
Grey is an associate proiessor in
the department of Political
Science. here at Grinnell.

“Socially. this country is still
overwhelmingly liberal," Grey
said. As a result. he said, conser-
vative biases on issues such as
school prayer, abortion and civil
rights will not become as intrenr
ched in national policy as some

Central America Statement
-prods idle CSL

by Ellen E. Brooke

New Business provided a
stimulus for a large attendance at
next week's Joint Board meeting.
This week Matt Golden informed
JB ol his intention to put on next
week's agenda a Statement of
Principles on Central America.
According to Golden forty col»
leges and universities through the
United States have already en-
dorsed this statement.

With some modifications to be
made by the Committee on Stu-
dent Politics. this statement
reads: ”On the occasion at the ari-
niveisairy oi the us. anion in Grounds,
we wish to express our opposition to
military intervention by our country in
the attain of Central American nations.

while our views may ditier on the pro—
priery ol the action in Grenada, we,
along with n majority oi students and
other Americans, thinly agree that: i.
No U5, troops should be sent to Cenlial
America;

2. us. aid to the Nicaraguan ”tonlras"
should be halted entirely;

3. the U.S. should not quarantine
Nicaragua, and;

a. financial assistance to the military in
Cc al American nations should be
conditioned upon improved respect oi
human rights by their governments."

Before February 28 at next
semester a student body refel'enr
dum will be held on a cnnsititu-
tional amendmenttpassetl by J.B.
It states the existence and your»
pose oi the Committee on Student

with “Him:" “Lord." ”Father."
"Master," ”King.” and so on.
Life.

The Committee on Student Life
had been the main topic ol Joint
Board. First, there was a resolu-
tion urging CSL to “set its agenda
and establish a regular meeting
time by November 14, 1984".
Some members. questioning its
effectiveness. were informed that
the resolution couldn‘t force CSL
to comply with it. but it alerts CSL
to student concern about its pro
ceedings, or lack at them.

A proposed Constitutional
Amendment to Article 6. Section
2. was the other item which in-
volved CSL. Many students ex-
press an objection to this amend-
ment as this committee is already
listed in the Student Handbook.

The rationale behind this
amendment, according to Russ
Matteson. is that by being in the
constitution, incoming SGA
presidents will be aware of the
need to elect the necesary six
students in time to enable the
committee to be active within the
first two weeks of the following
school year. .

Both the resolution and the
amendment passed. According to
the Constitution. the amendment
must also be passed by so percent
of the student body in a referen-
dum. A motion to hold this
reiercndum beiore February 28 at
next semester passed as ucll.
