Last year I lived in a high-rise
apartmentby a lake. near the edge of
a midsized German city. Roughly
every two months I received a pack-
age from oﬂumpus studies, con
taining five or six copies of the carn-
pus memo and The 5&8. This meant
that I could read about Paul Froese,
about how he felt close to the stur
dents atGrinnell. how he‘d sleptwith

friends thoughthewasfunny.so they
cut out his quotes and hung them on
the bathroom wall. There were other
people’s opinions in The 5&3 too.
One fellow was writing to “piss
people off”; that was “the whole
point." The Germans thought his are

those quotes to the bathroom. but
didn‘t hang them on the wall.

This columnisaboutwords. Itis an
attempt to disentangle myself from
the sticky web of loaded terms and
limiting usage which I have woven,
often without second thought, into
the fabric of my language. Vocabur
lary determines how we think, both
in limiting the complexity and preci-
sion of our verbal expression. and by
biasing the way we think aboutthings.
Words are seldom value-neuu-al.

Today’s word is terrorism. Web—
ster‘s Third New International Dicv
tionary deﬁnes terrorism as “the sys-
tematic use of terror (a state of in-
tensefear orapprehension) asa means
of coercion. Terrorism is more
commonly underswod to be “pre-
meditated attacks againstcivilian and
military targets withoura declaration
of war." The first incident of terror-
ism which I learned ofwas the taking
of the American hostages in Tehran
in late 1979 — its instructional value
is immense.

But ﬁrst, a fairy tale. Once upon a
time there was a small country which
was going through yowing pains. Its
people were poor, ill-fed. underedu~

Grinnell, Sweet Grinnell

By Diane Brumley

On Monday, August 21. I accom-
panied a friend on a road trip to St.
Paul, Minnesom. Our quest on this
road trip was to ﬁnd a collegecompa-
table toGr-innell thatmy friend could
transfer to, since Grinnell does not
offer a major in public relations or
communications. As it turns out
“comparable" became a key word.

Although the recount of our expe-
rience below may appear so comical
that it should be fictional, it‘s not.
Rather. it’s the truth. the whole truth.
and nothing but the truth. ..so help all
of the other colleges that fall so short
of Grinnell!

12:05: We arrived at the campus.
Donna’s appoinu-nenr wasn’t until
1:30. But that was line, we ﬁgured;
this way. we could get a tour of the
campus before sitting down with an
administrator to talk about the col—
lege. Oops! We thought wrong, The
gum—chewing, nail-ﬁling (no joke!)
secretary who greeted (7) us infon-ned
us that all of the counselors were out

to lunch. and asked that we come
back in an hour, at which time we
could possibly squeeze in a ﬁfteen-
minute tour.Surething.lady.Wejust

to. Oh. and by the way—we’re
charmed by your attitude.

I200: Hello,we’reback. How ‘bout
that tour now? The secretary 7 yes.

remnants all over her lips ‘ looks at
us as if to say. “Who the hell are

Bury the Harris Center

 

To the Editor:

While reading the article about the
proposed student center (Aug 25), I
was shocked to learn that the aes-
thetics of this building seemed more
valuablethanitsbadlynoeded facili
ties. The idea of cutting back on the
movie theater, the concert hall and
the student activities quarters in order
to save the unique outward appear-
ance of this structure, seem to me,
absurd and ridiculous. A proposal
such as this makes me wonder if the
building is to serve the needs of the
student community or those of the
publicrelations officel was pleased
to learn, however, that President
Drake, taking into consideration the
“strategic location” of this building
does not wish to “muck up that part
of the campus with a bad building,"
though it seems that even he would
sanction a reduction of facilities.
rather than detract from the proposed
outer design.

Perhaps there is a solution within
theaestheticandfinancialconstraints
of the project which would not
compromise the facilities.

I propose a compromise which
would serve as a model to other
colleges, would be aesthetically
beautiful and very friendly to the
environment, yet provide the same
facilities as the currently planned
building while also being less ex-
pensive in construction and long-
tenn heating and cooling costs: make

advantagesover their above-ground
counterpans: they are easier to heat
in winter and micr to cool in sum-
mer due to their lack of large win»
dow space and their closer proxim-
ity to the insulating oreooling eanh.
Having windows in a movie theatre
and a concert hall doesn’t seem too
logical anyway since movies and
concerts are rarely enjoyable in di-
rect daylight. By reducing all or the
majority of any above-ground super-
structure, these buildings permit a
maximum use of the natural envi-
ronment above. i.e. North Campus

Trays of Our Lives

To the Editor:

I am deeply disturbed by the col-
lege Dining Services' new policy of
discouraging traymarkingin the two
student cafeterias. Without really
consulting us. Dave McConnell‘s
Dining Services is trying to restrict
us from enjoying what has become a
well-repocted tradition here at Grin-
nell. I challenge Mr. McConnell to
come up with even a dozen Grinnell
students who are actually offended
by (gasp!) “tray vandalism." In the
meantime, I and my approximately
1.300peers will continue to mark on
Cowles and Quad trays foras long as
we attend school here, Perhaps the
thousands of dollars needlessly
wasted on new trays would have
been better spent on a one-way air-
line ticket for Mr. McConnell to
Mongolia.
