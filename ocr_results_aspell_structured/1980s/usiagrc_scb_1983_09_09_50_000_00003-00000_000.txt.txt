Pauline Chui (pronounced chu ee) from
Hong Kang,,is one of the many foreign
students learning to adapt to American
College life. “Before I get here, people say
that college really easy. You can party all
ﬁle time. , . that's not the fact!"

Students at Grinnell come from all over
the United States. They come from difr
ferent backgrounds and have many dif
ferent lifestyles. American students, who
are going to college for the first time, must
learn to adapt to college lifestyle, as
students do all over the country. There are
also special adjustments that some
students from different parts of the counr
try must make. Californians and Floridans
have to adjust to the hard winters.
Students from big cities must learn to ads
just to the small town atmosphere. But of
all the students at Grinnell, it is the foreign
student that must make the gratest ads
justments, Not only must they adjust to
college life as American students must,
but they must also adjust to the American
lifestyle and culture.

The learning experience for foreign
students is similar to the many Grinnell
students that travel abroad each year to
experience different lifestyles. Many Grin-
nell students find that the countries they
visit are heavily influenced by the United
States. The studenm that were interviewed
here, all attested to the effects that
Western life had on their countries.

Sanjay Khanna of India said that he was
very aware of ﬁle inﬂuence that me United
States had on his country. Sanje’s adapta-
tion to Grinnell has been greatly influenc-
ed by the knowledge of Western lifestyles,
Going to Grinnell was Sanje‘s first total
immersion in Western values, which he is
very critical of, Sanje said that Grinnellian
and American materialistic values have
begun to influence even his own values.

Sanjay chose Grinnell and not a univer-
sity in India, “because i wasn’t good
enough to get into the Indian Institute of
Technology. It is much harder to get into
there than into Grinnell."

There are approximately 53 foreign
students presently attending Grinnell. The
largest proportions of foreign students
come irom India and Pakistan. The
number of foreign students on campus has
increased signiiicantly from last year. Ac
cording to Nicole Hamon, international
student Organization (ISO) Director, the
increase is not due to an increase in
recruiting. “Most foreign students have
heard about Grinnell via alumni or from
people who are very familiar with the
Midwest."

“Before I get here people
say that college really easy.
You can party all the time...

that’s not the fact!"

Grinnell does some recruiting in other
countries, but foreign recruitment is no
where near the scale of domestic
recruiting. This year only two people were
sent abroad, to Latin America and to
Europe. Even so, the majority of recruit
ment is done at schools which have ex
change programs with American Colleges
and Universities, Hamun remarked that,
”Most foreign students come from counr
tries who's university system is not as
good as the college system in the Us."
Another problem for foreign students tryr
ing to attend colleges in their own coun-
tries is that of political turmoil. In many
foreign countries the greatest pressure on
government comes from university
students. A foreign government will oiten
close down the university in order to pre-
vent and squelch student uprisings.

Ama Dzobo (Jo Bo) said that in her
native country of Ghana, the university
has been closed. The government has told
the people Ulat it does not have enough
funds to run Hie university. Ama com-
merited, “It’s a military government and
the people think it uses the money to im-
port arms." With the university closed.
Ama decided to look into the [1.5. She had
been here before in 1979 when her father
was an assistant professor at Columbia.
She decided to come to Grinnell because
her mother was invited by the United
Church of Christ in Iowa to speak about
African women. Ama heard about Grinnell
from her mother who later taught at Iowa
State University.

Alex Melencovitch of Greece had an
even more direct link to Grinnell. His high
school, Anatolia, was founded by Grinnell
graduates, “Three Grinnell grads, like
missionaries, founded the high school in
1586, in Turkey." After the Balkan ended
around 1913, the school moved to Greece.
The president and vicepresident were
both Grinnell graduates. Since then,‘ it has
been a tradition for students of Anatolia to
come to Grinnell. Presently, there are four
students from Anatolia attending Grinnell.

Foreign students come to Grinnell from
many different countries for many dif-
ferent reasons. International studens face
many different problems in adjusting to
Grinnell. One of the most common pro-
blems the foreign student faces is master-
ing the English language.

“1 can’t take class with language
because with lecture hall i can’t compete.
with other American students,” Pauline
Chui remarked, Pauline is in her second
year at Grinnell and is having some difr
ficulty mastering the language. “!'m a
physics major, i think", Pauline said,
“Math doesn’t involve literature.” Pauline
had two years of intense English while in
China, but it still was not enough to
prepare her for college writing. “I spent
hours in dictionaries,” she said, “I spent
twice as much time as other people [did on
their papers].” Pauline took College
Writing in order to improve her
vocabulary. Pauline is also taking 200 level
courses in physics, math,‘- and chemistry
and also a special topic course in Chinese
and Society. Although she is learning
about language quickly she still needs a
dictionary to interpret many of the words.

Unlike Pauline, Alex started English
when he was eleven years old. He has been
studying French since he was seven. when
he arrived from Greece, he took a reading
and writing lab to increase his vocabulary.
And although he appears to have mastered
the language, he stated, “I still miss
jokes.” Alex said about missing jokes, “A
lot of times it's the colloquial words and
the cultural differences."

Unlike the other foreign students inter-
viewed, Mario Negrini is studying at Grin-
nell for only one year. He is an exchange
student from Costa Rica, with a particular
interest in learning English and not ac»
quiring a BA. Mario learned much of the
language when he first came to the US. in
junior high school. “I spent five months in
California when Iwas in junior high, which
is where I learned English and some
slang,” Mario stated, “people in California
have an accent. They use different words.
When I came here, i had a few problems
the first few days, in a few weeks, I will be
able to adjust.”

Mario reiterated several times that
“beer” is as important in Costa Rica as it
is for Grinnellians. “In Costa Rica, we
don't have restrictions for drinking. If you
are ten years old, you want to drink beer."
The parties at the Costa Rican University
are like Grinnell’s centered around beer.

Pauline said that people in Hong Kong
seldom drink. She was told by her brother
who lived in England that people smoke,
but she Said, “Here, they don’t smoke,
they drink."

Sanjay stated that Western Culture In-
fluences India to such a great extent tht
students there drink similar to those
students here at Grinnell, with the purpose
to get drunk.

A possibly unique Grinnell tradition that
Ama and Pauline pointed out was the lack
of shoes on nearly half of the students here
at Grinnell. “Everyone here is barefoot"
Pauline pointed out. “even at home [in the
house] they wear slippers." Ania stated.
“If they had shoes in Ghana they wouldn’t
walk barefoot.”

Many American Grinnellians have trou-
ble adjusting to die weather, but many of
the climates which international students
are used to are radically different from
Iowa. “Greece", Alex reported, “has little
snow. It averages around 4o to 50 degrees.
Even the food is planted in the winter, Of
course in the U.s, that is impossible
because everything wouldfrecze.”

Pauline said that she had a hard time
finding the clothing that she needed for
iowa, “My foreign student advisor told me
to bring a coat and a pair of boots, but in
Hong Kong it’s so hard to find that kind of
thing. It never snows in Hong Kong. I
never see snow before I get here,” It is so
hard for foreign students to anticipate
everything that they might need to know
about the United States. Maybe what
epitomizes these students adventure to a
new country and new lifestyle is the {act
that Pauline was reminded to bring winter
clothing many times, but when she arrived
here she had not brought any summer
clothes and was not remotely ready for
Iowa's rather warm Augusts and
Septembers,
