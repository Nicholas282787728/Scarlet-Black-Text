Football rolls on,
knocks off Vikings 18-7

Manternach another all—star performance

by P. J. Eppler and Gordon
Schreibcr

Grinnell's football Pioneers
continued to esmblish themselves
as a competitive team in the
Midwest Conference with an 18-7
win over highly regarded
Lawrence this past Saturday. The
Pioneers dominated the much
bigger Vikings on both sides of
the ball, relying on an impressive
rushing attack on offense and a
defense that "flat out got after
them," according to head coach
Greg Wallace

Another imponant factor in
the victory was the solid play
turned in by the special teams
throughout the aftemoonr Coach
Wallace emphasized the ﬁne play
put fonh by all units of the team
by stating that the win was truly
a team win.

The Pioneers established in
the first quarmr that lhcy were the
superior team, or at least on this
particular Saturday. Lawrence
only had the ball for two posses—
sions in the initial period, and
each time failed to make a ﬁrst
down This was due to a quartet
of swarming linebackers, who
were freed up to make key hits by
the penetration of the defensive
line.

While the defense was stifling
all Lawrence attempts to move
the ball, the offense established a
nishing attack that proved to be
very effective 0n the Pioneers'
second possession, they used 13
plays to go 57 yards, all on the
ground, to record the ﬁrst touch-
down of the game. The drive was
extended twice by key fourth
down conversions, the ﬁrst com-
ing on quarterback Jim Weiand’s
keeper to the right side on an op-
tion, the second on Paul Manter-
nach's blast up the middle from
the Lawrence 10 yard line.
Shortly therafter, Manternach
carried three yards for the first of
his three touchdowns on the day.
After the point after attempt was
missed, Grinnell held a 6—0 lead.

Jim Weiand barely gets off a pass against swarming
Viking rush. The quarterback had 106 combined yards on
the afternoon. The Pioneers outplayed Lawrence 18-7.

sion, they managed to move to
Lawrence's 20 yard line before the
drive stalled. Kicker Mike Mo-
han then barely missed wide right
on a 37 yard field goal, allowing
the Vikings to take over on their
own 20. From there, Lawrence
was able to go 80 yards for their
only score of the game.

At one point, the Vikings
were able to convert a 4th down
conversion to keep the drive
alive, and also hit a long pass to
Grinnell's 25 yard line despite
good coverage by the Pioneer
secondary. From there. the
Vikings moved the ball inside the
10, where it took four plays to
score the touchdown against the
stingy Grinnell defense.

'Lawrence‘s point after attempt

was good to give them the lead.
7-6.

The Pioneers responded well,
taking over the ball on their own
45 yard line after a 23 yard return
by Marty l-lunsucker. Grinnell
needed only seven plays to cover
the 55 yards for the go ahead
touchdown. Manternach punched
it in from three yards out to ﬁn-
ish the drive. The Pioneers' two
point conversion attempt was in-
terceptcd by Lawrence to keep
Grinncll‘s lead at 1257. Neither
team was able to generate any
more offense in the ﬁrst half and
the 12-7 count stood at halftime.

The second half was dominated
by the defenses, with the two
teams combining for 5 turnovers,
3 by Lawrence. In addition to the
turnovers created by the Pioneer
defense, they came up with key
plays or defensive stands

throughout the half to keep
Lawrence off the scoreboard, in~
eluding a blocked ﬁeld goal at—
tempt by freshman Loe Kramer.

The intense defense of the

Pioneers set up the only touch
down of the half for Grinnell’s
offense by recovering a fumble at
the Lawrence 35 yard line.

Weiand immediatly hit Hun-
sucker to move the Pioneers in-
side the 20 yard line. Manternach
did the rest from there, eventually
scoring on a one yard dive. The
two point conversion again failed
and Grinnell led 18-7. This
would prove to be the ﬁnal score.
Lawrence desperately tried to get
back in the game, but were
thwarted by interceptions, one by
Mike Anderson and the other by
Mohan.

The defense had a great day.
due in a large part to Anderson,
Kramer, Scott Truesdell and Pat
Berrigan, who started for an im
jured lohn Lopos. Manternach
led the Pioneers in rushing and
receiving, picking up 144 yards
on the ground and 29 more on
two receptions. The Pioneers'
offense was also helped by good
field position, set up by return
men Dave White and Huusuckcr.

Grinnell hopes to continue
their success this week at archri-
Val Coe. a team that Grinnell's
seniors have never beaten. Coach
Wallace stressed that while he
certainly would like to defeat
Coc. he does not believe the
whole season centers around the
game with the Kohawks. Coe
enters the game with a 1-3 record.
while Grinnell stands at 2-1.

Dream of nationals still alive
despite 2-1 loss to CO

by Bob Lifton

It had to happen some time.
All winning streaks, or any
streaks for that matter, eventually
have to come to an end (inst ask
Don Drysdale: and, ah, Columbia
—- football, that is -- just hang in
there, your time is bound to
come). Yes, the men's soccer
team did lose 2-1 in their highly-
touted match against Colorado
College, thereby bringing their
record to 6-1 on the season. But
no, there isn't any reason for
them to hang their heads low;
they need not be ashamed of any
thing. Sure, a win against the
perennially ranked Tigers coupled
with a strong "second half‘ would
have virtually clinched the Pie»
neers a berth at nationals Yet.
all is not lost While they can
no longer "coast" into this illus-
trious post-season tourney, the
Pioneers still do have a legiti-
mate shot. Hey, they didn't
decorate their scaips for nothing.

It's safe to say that save the
last 10-15 minutes. CC domi-
nated Sunday's match. The ever-
hustling Tigers outshot the Pin»
neers 22-5. including a 12-2 ad—
vantage in comer kicksr The
Grinnell defense seemed to be
perpetually backstepping, with
goalie Randy Sceley forced to
make 10 saves. It's tough to win
when you can‘t get the ball out of
your own end.

Secley refers to Dorsey, the
Tiger's striker, as a "scorer." This
rather acute observation comes
from personal experience
(memories our fashionAconscious
goalie would gladly forget), as
the mountain»boy has had a career
and a half against the Grinnell
keeper, scoring 7 goals over the
last 3 years. Dorsey lived up to
his heralded reputation this black
Sunday, scoring both CC goals,
diplomatically spreading them

out, one per half.

The Pioneers avoided a
shutout with about 10 minutes
left in the game, as KJ. Noll
perfectly timed an Ian Lorimer
cross, and headed it into the upper
left comer. While Grinncll did
not manage to put any more
numbers on the board, they did
make a remarkable improvement
over the previous half, finally
playing like they've played in the
past. Up to this point, the Pio-
neers were very sluggish, appar—
ently intimidated by the kids
from Rocky Mountain Central.

The Tigers are a very well-
disciplined team (whining and
immature, but wcllacoached).
They move the ball effectively on
offense, and trap any possible de-
velopments with a hounding do»
fcnse, a la John Thompson.
Most imponantly, however, they
always played within themselves.
Such was not the case with the
Pioneers.

According to Noll. "We
played a little uninspired and were
relatively timid until we ﬁnally
scored." These thoughts wre
echoed by co-caprain defenscmen
Brad Bisgard: "We were too
worried about who we were play-
ing Instead of playing our own
game, we played off of them"
And when the Pioneers ﬁnally did
turn things around and come into
their own, it was too little, too
late

Assessing this first loss,
coach Pﬁtsch commented, "Our
team was rather intimidated and
flat out there, suffering from
some nervous tension or some
thingr...We just didn't play up to
our level. We did ﬁnally loscn
up at the end, but by that time it.
was too late."
