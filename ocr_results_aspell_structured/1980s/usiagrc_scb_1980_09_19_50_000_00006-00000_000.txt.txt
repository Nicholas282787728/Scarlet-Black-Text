by Mom Morin

Last Friday Wells Weyrauch, owner
of Weyrauch Flower Center at 1141
Penrose St. alerted police of the theit of
several plants treated with the
dangerous pesticide Temic. Police
notitied the college, the public via an
announcement on KGRN and Grinnell
General Hospital of the theft. Accorr
ding to the September 15 issue 01 the
Grinnell Herald—Register, authorities
fear that whoever took the rubber, jade
and fiddle-leaf iig plants from a
quarantined area or the greenhouse
might suffer potentially fatal effects
irom handling them.

Dean 01 Students Jim Tederman was
“appologetically” contacted by police
so that the college community could be
warned and informed that Grinnell
General emergency room has an an-
u'dute to the toxin. ”The police didn't
want to accuse students or stealing
plants,” explained Tederman. “They
don't want to prosecute anyone."

An announcement about the plants
was made on KDIC and R.A.s have
posted warning signs around campus.
As oi this writing, no students have cone
tacied the college and no one has
received treatment {or Temic poisoning
at Grinnell General.

Visitation Sunday draws near

by Aileen Chang

Church visitation Sunday on Sept, 23,
will provide students with "a chance
really to talk with someone at length, so
they and townspeople may get to know
each other," College Chaplain Dennis
Haas explained, Every year on Church
Visitation Sunday interested students
attend services at a church of their
choice and share a meal with members
of that church, either as individual
guests of ta milies or in larger groups oi
students and congregation members.

Students who complete icrms
published in the Sept. 9 and 16 memos

and deposit them in Haas mailbox by
Wednesday the 24th may participate,
Haas will iurther the inlormation to the
churches, who will invite students to
their particular events.

Haas emphasized the necessity ior
students to communicate clearly their
attendance plans, Arriving unexpected
ly can cause an inconvenience, and,
more importantly, students who [all to
show up or phone to say they cannot
make it otten disappoint people expece
ting to entertain them, stressed Haas,

Vandals leave their mark

These tire marks on the Episcopal Church lawn and others on
South Campus will cost $200 and $500 to repair respectively.
Early Tuesday morning two Gilman men were apprehended
for the action and charged with Criminal Mischief, a Class D
felony. Detective Doug Shuiis of The Grinnell Police Depart-
ment thanked students for their calls commenting, “without
the students we wouldn’t have been able to make the

arrests.”
