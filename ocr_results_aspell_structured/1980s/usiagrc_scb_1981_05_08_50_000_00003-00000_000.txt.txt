Hall resigns Health Center position

by Laura Carter

The Health Center will lose its ad»
ministrative suppervisor June 1 when
lrma B. Hall resigns arter 25 years on
the center’s staff. Hall submitted her
resignation to Jim Tederman, vice
president and dean of Student Altairs,
April 29, although it came as no sur»
prise to the administration. “irma and
i had been discussing this tor most of
this year and it was just a matter ol her
figuring out when she wanted to leave,"
Tederman said.

“I'm tired, I'm weary.” said Hall
about her reasons for quitting. “It‘s
getting easy to stay home at night 'and
I'm not ready for that yet.” Her plans
after June 1 are to move away from
Grinnell and to travel. “l'm looking for-
ward to having nothing to do." she add-
ed.

Hall came to Gr‘innell in 1956 as a
staff nurse. “I thought I would stay for
three or (our years," She stated. “But
once I got my room in, I felt no inclina»
tion to leave.” She became head nurse

South African
policy

May 2, lost

We, the trustees of Grinnell College,
hereby reaffirm our continuing can.
cern over the situation in South Mrlca.
We have asked the administration to
communicate this concern to the
various constituencies or the college
and other interested parties. We turther
have asked the administration to ex»
plore what is being done by sister in-
stitutions with like concerns. Given the
divergency of available information on
this subject, we invite all interested
constituencies of the college to explore
with us the facts of the South AIrican
Stituation. We also wish to explore the
appropriate role or addressing this and
other similar issues. In doing so, we ex-
press our commitment that any such
action be consistent with the overall
mission at the college and the respon-
sibility of the trustees for the continuing
health of the college.

Accordingly, the chairman of the
Board of 'nlrstees has appointed a com-
mittee to work with other constituen-
cies of the college to educate ourselves
concerning such issues.

 

in 1963 and assumed her present posi»
tion in 1967.

During this time Hall has seen many
changes in the Health Center and its
operation. No of these changes con»
cern the size of the stall and the hours
of the center. Hall explained that the
staff once consisted of three nurses who
worked around the clock in shifts and
up to 50 hours a week each. This ended
about live years ago, she continued,
when the college decided to cut costs by
keeping only two nurses on staff and
hiring student clerks to monitor the
center at night.

Another change has been the location
of the center. When Hall first joined the
skill, the health service was located on
the fourth floor of Main Hall. It was
moved die following year to Pine Tree
House and the current building was
dedicated in May, l957. Hall said, “I
saw it go up brick by brick.” She added,
“You can't be in a place this long and
not leel possessive,”

Tederman reported that no modificar
tions are planned for the Health Center
except for any changes in style and
organization that the new director may
introduce This director will be selected
by a team of Dr. James Paulson, the
center’s medical adviser. Tederman,
Executive Vice-President Waldo
Walker and Hall. Tederman said that
adve ng tor the position will be
published throughout local and regional
areas and he hoped to have the job filled
by June 15 or July 1 at the latest.

The timing of the recentlywithdrawn
proposal to relocate the Health Center
services at Grinnell General Hospital
and her resignation is coincidental,
Hall stated. But she admitted that her
possessiveness towards the center did
inﬂuence her feelings about the move.
“i won‘t say I was completely happy
about it,” she said. “I wouldn't want
anyone else in here [the current
building].”

Trustees talk of
“nuts and bolts"

by Seth Melsel

Boring is really not the correctadjec
tive but with the exception of the discus»
sion on South African investments. the
trustee‘s meeting last weekend was
certainly . . . uneventful.

The trustees, on campus tor their spr-
ing meeting, spent most of their time on
“nuts and bolts" altairs. As required by
the bylaws. the administration, the
chairman of the faculty and the student
government president gave reports on
the college. Topics included in the ad-
ministration presenwtion were the “F”
grade debate, recent grants, the status
of the Burling Library renovation, the
Fire Marshall's report, cnnlerences on
campus, development programs, the
Annual Fund Telethon, recent awards
won by the faculty and the admission of
black students.

The trustees also approved plans and
funding [or the renovation of the Post
Office and rte-roofing of the chemistry
department’s rooi. Other action was the
authorization of funds for the final
working drawings of the Burling
Library renovation. however, flnal

authorization will not be considered un-
til the [all

They also chose John Kleinschmidt,
professor emeritus ot French, to begin
work on revising the trustees' bylaws.
The bylaws were last revised in 1974 and
are badly outdated, especially because
the administration of the college is now
restructured.

Many trustee committee: met in
cluding the Trustee-Faculty Committee
to discuss fringe benefits and the Com-
munity Life Committee which met with
resident advisers and the Concerned
Black Students.

South African investment was the
main area of debate, though, Trustees
met with four students on the topic or
divestiture and elected to form a com-
mitte of Trustees Fred Little, Donald
Stewart and Steven Jobs to recommend
options to the board at its next meeting.
President George Drake was asked to
contact other colleges on this matter to
ascertain their actions and to look into
the possibility of concerted action,
