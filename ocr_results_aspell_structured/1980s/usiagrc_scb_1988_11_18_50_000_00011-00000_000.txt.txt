Unnoticed art on campus:
The Forum

by Kaspar Stoffelmayr

To many people's great
surprise. there is much lnore to
art at the Forum titan student cxn
hibits at the Terrace Gallery. The
art on permanent display at the
Forum, some of it hidden in dark
comers for protection from direct
sunlight and most of it simply
never given a second glance, is
often very good. Let's take a
short tour of the Forum.

Entering the Forum
through the lower level foyer, we
immediately ﬁnd two inconspic-
uous prints. By the Xerox ma-
chine (the SGA side) is
"Balloons," a color lithograph by
Alexander Calder. who must be
pretty good because they gave
him a whole room at the Art In-
stitute of Chicago. This is a re
ally nice print with blues and reds
and yellows that kind of bleed

. into each other. Over on the
Student Affairs side of the foyer
is "Plate I." a serigraph by
Jimmy Ernst. This abstract print
in red, orange. and blue comes
across as almost gaudy and is
rather unappealing. Another
Jimmy Ernst print (with an
equally uncreative name) in
South Lounge is more interest-
ing. but more on that later.
The Closest thing to art in
North Lounge is a dart board, so
we move on to the Grill. In the
back. angled out of almost
everyone's sight, are two
lithographs by Comeille, a Bel-
gianvDutch artist of some impor-
tance. Both prints emphasize
- bright. solid colors and primitive
‘shapes; they look a bit like the
work of a twisted third-grader.
These pictures of a woman lying
in grass with a threatening bird
over her are striking and decidedly
unsettling. They may not bejust
what you want to look at while
eating lunch. but they are worth
seeing,

The front of the Grill is
ﬂanked by two appliqucd fclt
banners. To the the north is
"The New (Old) Glory," with
yellow stars and black and white
stripes, by Robert Indiana. Indi»
and is a pop—art painter from

interpretation it offers nothing

is much nicer. The next time
you are in the Grill, takea second
and try to decide if the image re-
minds you more of a ﬂower or a
bird. The more time you spend
looking at this banner. the more
interesting it becomes. The
marble sculpture in the front
center of the Grill,
"Circumscription," is very im-
pressive. especially considering
that Rod Acton was a Grinnell
sophomore or junior when he
completed it in 1976. This
intertwined marble sphere is
probably the most appreciated
piece of art in the Forum; it is
certainly one of the best.

In South Lounge we also
find some cxoc 'onal art. At the
back are "Ciel." an etching and
aqiiatint by Tetsuo Araki, and

"Flaic VI," another Serigraph by
Jimmy Ernst. "Ciel" defies Cie-
scription. People have said it
brings to mind breasts. rifles, and
checkers. In any case. it is
provocative "Plate VI" is a print
of black and gray geometric
shapes that compliments "Ciel"
well. "Buco Senza Pretese" is a
small sculpture by Pietro Con—
saga against the north wall. It is
hard to know just what to make
of it, but there is something both
challenging and pleasing about
this dark sculpture of walnut and
brass. The most interesting piece
in South Lounge, though. is the
nineteenth century Indian wood
relief, artist unknown, on the
south wall near the front. The
ornately carved figures of this
piece are fascinating and unique
to the Forum.

The Forum's widely igr
nored art collection may be of
mixed quality. but it has some-
thing to interest just about cv-
cryone. You could do worse for a
study break.

"Nude" by Jennifer Nugent.

Nugent exhibit reviewed

by Steve Fors
If you haven't had the
chance to view Jennifer Nugent‘s
show, Find the Red One. cur-
rently on display in the Fonim's
Terrace Gallery. take some time
out of your busy schedule to do
so. As you walk through the
gallery, this excellent selection of
woodblock prints. monotypes,
drypoinis, and drawings will take
you to both familiar and faraway
places: it will take you from very
formal figurative work to
impressionistic abstraction.

a feeling for the purity and simr
plicity of the human form. The
two abstractions "Hot" and "Wet"
are also worth noting as the rich,
lusli fields of red and blue are
somewhat reminiscent of Phillip
Guston's early work. The last
piece in the show, and my per-
sonal favorite, is a drypoint enti-
lled "Ncar'Home". This little
