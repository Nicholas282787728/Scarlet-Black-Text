Indonesia: ' »
AYear of Living Dangerously?

By Bruce Emu-id

When I was assigned to Indonesia by the
American Field Service in the spring of
1985, I admit that. despite my geniuine ex-
citement, I had to look at a map to get my
bearings: Except for vague recollections
of “Java Man", the tourist haven of Bali,
and "The year of Living Dangerously",
the Mel Gibson-Sigourney Weaver iilm
detailing an Australian journalist’s
coverage of the abortive PKI (communist
coup in 1965, I knew little of this South East
Asian archipelago. I searched my local
library for books on Indonesia, only to iind
many outdated works written before the
ascension of the current president, Suharr
to, (some were even relics irom the era of
Dutch colonialism), or scholarly texts ex-
amining post—colonial attempts at in
dustrial development and economic
recovery. Thus I departed for Indonesia
expecting to be confronted by thirdrworld
realities of poverty and ignorance
Granted, these assumptions were often
confirmed by the glaring social and eoc~
nomic paradoxes of this society yet I grew
to love West Sumatra, (which is nothing
like cosmopolitan, garish Jakarta or Bali,
where Australian and Dutch tourists outs
number the locals), a beautiful land of dor-
mant volcanos and high mountains, shim-
mering lakes, ubiquitious rice fields, vast
tropical forests, and the people, who, while
still resolute in their traditional practices,
were friendly and hospitable.

The approximately 165 million Indoner
sians, most of whom adhere, in widely

, varying degrees of devotion, to Islam, are
divided into hundreds of ethnic groups.
The Minangkabau (literally “Victorious
Buffalo”) people oi West Sumatra are pro-
hably second only to the Chinese in the far
north of Sumatra in their fervent worship
of Islam. The landscape is dotted with
mosques, Moorish in architecture and
quite unlike those of-Java. Many of the
Minang women Still wear the traditional
delbab, the Islamic head covering. The
Christians and Buddhists of this area are
people who have been resettled in West
Sumatra under the government’s
transmigration program; a few churches
and a sole Buddhist temple exist only in
the West Sumatran capital, Padang, and
the former Dutch mountain fortress, Buk-
kiiinggi. The few Christians and Buddhists
I met (old me that they were discriminated
against and that their houses were often
Vandalized. This seemed, however, to
strengthen their belief in their religion and
unite them as communities. For example,
Christian men refuse to be circumcised
because this is an Islamic religious
custom.

Padang is a small, clean city although
poverty is widespread. It received Presi-
dent Suharto's much coveted “cleanest Ci-
ty" award the year I was there but, with
the standard of its competition considered,
this honor is somewhat qualified. Every
day I saw the same beggars, usually vies
tims of leprosy in the city’s pasar
(market), Many of the people, sometimes
children perhaps as young as seven or
eight. earn their living pushing food carts
or hawking newspapers, cigarettes, soft
drinks, even toys, on the streets.

Most oi Padang‘s population live in tiny
wooderlck dwellings on riverbanks and
irom this source they obtain water ior all
their needs, I remember how my Western
sensibility was shocked when, on my way
to school, I noticed people bathing and
washing clothes on one side of the bridge
while, further upstream, people relieved
themselves. During the Monsoon season.
these same rivers often swell and flood the
surrounding villages, killing tens of

thousands oi people and destroying
numerous homes When this latter
catastrophe happened to one of my
iriends, he accepted it fatallstically as
“Allah's choosmg”.

My host family, however, was not
typical of the average Indonesian. Their
house, situated in the most fashionable
area of Padang where the city’s wealthy
live in whitewashed Spanishrstyle mans
sions, overiiowed with gadgets and com~
modities 7 was, televisions, video
games, even an icercream maker 7 at
testing to their love ior all things
American.

"They asked incessant
questions about sex- 'after
all/interim is the land of
free sex, right?’ "

I tried to correct their warped percepr
tion of us. society as that projected in
“Dallas” and ”Dynasty". Our relationship
was frustrating at first, due to their incomr
prehension of English, (my host sister
often were a “I’m Forty and Feeling
Foxy” T-shirt, utterly- oblivious to its
meaning), and my smattering of Bahasa
Indonesia; our initial conversations con-
sisted of agreements on the spiciness of
West Sumatran food and just how hot it
gets in the tropics. As my Indonesian im-
proved, I tried to describe aspects of us,
society which I considered important but
my comments were metwith an ignorance
and closermindedness that was apalling. I
would say that television is just an image
and not actually representative oi how real
Americans live, and that America is a land
of immigrants of diverse ethnic heritages
but this would invariably be received with
a faceitous remark about Blacks or
another minority group (Indonesians
ridicule Blacks yet would often
hypocritically pronounce Mohammed Alia
“great man" ior converting to Islam),
Their prejudice knew no bounds. They ask»
ed if I had ever met an “orang Jahudi”, (a
Jewish person), or a “kafir”, (an atheist
but also one who does not recognize Islam
as the supreme religion), and they would
disregard everything I said in opposition to
their preconceptions. They equated
Padang's minority Chinese community
with Communism and regarded them as
evil. even though these people have lived
in the city for generations. Iquickly realizr
ed that they were too established in their
own insular‘perceptions for me to ailect
them .

My adjustment to customs completely
alien to me 7 eating with my fingers, not
using toilet paper, being considered, at
eighteen years oi age, a “child”, entirely
dependent on my host parents 7 was off
flcult. The most significant taboo which I
occasionally iorgot was the “dirty leit
hand", named so because of its use in per-
sonal sanitary hygiene and Islamic doc-
trine. In less euphemistic terms. that
means Indonesians use water instead of
toilet paper. The right hand is the eating
and giving hand. I was reminded several
times how disgusting Indonesians iind
Western habits by a curt “You don’t use
tissue to wash your clothes, do you?”, (I
regarded this as a rather misinformed
analogy), Other customs I had to learn
concerned showing deference to elders,
never to standing while adults were
seated, not pointing my toes in the direc-
tion oi another person, or stepping over

people or iood. Folding arms while talking
was rude, as was putting my hands in my
pockets. When I visited a friend's house, it
was proper ior me to wait until my host
said “Silahkan minum/makan“ (please
drink/eat) and then to partake lightly of
what was put beiore me, when I was urged
to have seconds, I always had to eat and
drink a little more so as not to cause of
tense. -

Their favorite expression, “tidak apa
apa" (literally translated means “no what
what” but is equivalent to nevermindl,
reilects their policy never to get visibly
angry or flustered because it is “kasar”
(coarse, impolite); just flash a big grin
and all is simultaneously forgiven and
forgotten. [was often unaware of my own

, social errors because what Indonesians
consider general politeness, Americans
view as extreme tact, or even lying. If one
does something particularly shameful,
they refrain from intorming you, waiting
instead for you to realize accusatory
stares, or to leave the situation as it is until
through experience and witnessing others,
social graces are learned. It was only dur7
ing the final month of my stay that my host
brother told me that blowing one’s nose in
public, which I had done during frequent
bouts of Influenza, was the height of bad
manners yet none of my friends, teachers,
or family had ever alluded to this because
Iwould be “malu” (embarassed).

“The ‘dirty left hand'
refers to its use in

personal sanitary
hygiene. "

Yet another adjustment I had to make
was to the system known colloquially as
“Jam karet” (rubber time). If someone
promises to meet you at a certain time. he
will probably arrive an hour or so late —
watches and clocks do not seem to serve
any functional purpose in Indonesia except
as adnrnment,

Attending school was at first Iunny, then
chaotic and ultimately depressing. On my
first day, the students, most of whom were
nienteen or twenty years of age but about
sixth grade level maturity, shouted,
stared, and grabbed at the “freak", The
school itself was a dilapidated wooden
building, a remnant of Dutch colonialism
and hardly repaired since. There were no
labs or technical facilities to‘speak of, a
small, dirt-ﬂoor gym, a corrugated iron
structure selling iced tea and fried rice.
unstrategicaliy adjacent to the toilets (my
friends constantly reminded me of its eXr

cellent record for causing outbreaks of
“Sakit Kuning” 7 hepatitis 7 at the
school), and an omnipresent mosque, The
teachers were generally incompetent and
lazy. The teachers’ attendance was er-
ratic; if it rained they were definitely not
going to show up, and on every other day,
it was hit and miss Class consisted of ver-
batim recitation from text books, and
some teachers would even assign a student
to copy the notes for slower students. One
Chemistry teacher spent lessons baiting
one student; my iriends agreed that this
was because he was the sole Christian in
the class (usually Christians, Buddhists
and Hindus attend parochial schools).

The passivity my - fellow students
displayed, their unconditional acceptance
of what their teachers and parean Said.
was frightening to me, Most of them seem~
ed to drift through the classes without any
intention of abosorbing what was taught. A

icllow student informed me that most oi
the students are resigned to working after
iinishlng high school because the universir
ty entrance exams are rigorous and die
subsequent entry fee of between $1,500 and
$3,00 is beyond the iinances of the average
family. In a hook oi student proilles
presented to me at the end oi the school
year, most of the female students, in spite
of women's prominence in Minang culture,
identified their ambition as ”becoming a
good housewiie".

”Attending school was at

first funny, then chaotic,
and ultimatehI
depressing."

The tests were a larce as everybody
cheated, by using crib sheets or asking
permission to go to the bathroom and then
looking at textbooks outside of class. The
teachers were indifferent to the cheating,
never directly admonishing a student. The
other AFS'er in my city, who was profi-
cient enuught in the language to par-
ticipate in the university entrance exams,
was astounded as she watched one student
get up and give answers to another while
the proctor merely shook his head and
turned away.

The i norance about America I
witnesse in my host iamiiy was as oo-
vious among my schoolmates. They were
only interested in the most superficial
aspects of American society and asked in-
cessant questions about sex 7 “after all,
America is the land of free sex, right?” I
would reply that this was not actually true
(not in my case, anyway), but one oi them
would set about refuting this statement by
recounting how only the other night he had
watched an illegal erated video and seen
the wantoness of American womanhood.
My schoolmates who pored over the In-
donesian equivalents of the National Ens
quirer believed that all Americans were,
infected with AIDS, or IDS as they pro-
nounced it, an inevitable consequence of
our promiscuity. When I ventured that
perhaps such “abominations" exist in In-
donesia (which they doLas anyone who has
ever been past an Indonesian public park
at ten o‘clock at night can tell you), I was
answered with a curt “No. We still have
high morals here.”

In moments of candor my friends would
criticize my appearance, noting that I was
not the typical American they enVisionea,
“like Rambo”. According to them, I-
should dye my hair black because blond
hair is ugly, like an old persons, or that
my eyes were too light, “like a cat”, or
that my ears stuck out (the only reason
they liked my nose was because they
thought it bode favorably for other
physical endowments 7 it does not).

Once again I would try to explain that
Americans are not Rambo prototypes, and
that America is not like her films but my
protests were only met with smirks and
quizzical glances. It was an uphill and
ultimately selfrdefeating battle . . evens
tually it got me thinking, we aren’t really
like that, are we?
