The iinii spectrometer will also ins
tluenee the speciiic direction or research
conducted by Dodge Protessor Luther
Erickson this summer

though Mr. Erickson completed his doe-
toral iiork on the kinetics and mechanisms
or reactions in solution. his interest has
been in coordination complexes since his
arr alatGi-iniiell For example. onal969
\iSF Science Faculty Fellowship at the
University ol North Carolina. Erickson
studied "paramagnetic nickel complexes
involving EDTA' and other ligands,
molecules that "bind" metals,

More recently. while on sabbatical at the
Untverstty oi Wisconsin. irom which he
received his Fh.l) . Erickson studied solid
Ft complexes by X-ray crystallography.
This summer, he will study various Pt
complexes in solution with nnir spear
trometry,

To 'serve as an example. Erickson
displayed a model oi a Pt complex. "In
solution," he said. "the geometry oi the
molecule is no longer rigid," and conse
queritly. a portion oi the molecule is tree to
rotate While rotating, the moving atoms'
orientation to other atoms in the molecule
varies. and the properties oi the entire
complex vary with the orientation. lithe
rotation is slowed by cooling the solution.
Erickson can use nmr to observe these dii»
iering properties.

Erickson's group will also be continuing
work conducted lastsumnier which involv-
ed amino acid reactions with Ft. The
previous Iindings in this area were
presented at the Iowa Academy oi Science
last week. and Erickson hopes to see some
oi the results published.

DNA

from page 3

Past studies have shown that the
letrahyiiiena DNA is damaged by the
X-rd_ but that the damage is repaired ei-
iicieiitly The repair is so eiiicicnt. in tact,
that iitieii "small doses oi X-irradialloll
were administered to the tetrahymcna so
that only singlesti-and breaks in the DNA
tloublerllellx occurred, we observed over-
l’cpairv—lhc DNA wound up better,"lnadr
dition, Ulllelillopp said that these
organisms actually can repair double
Sll‘anrl breaks

Continuing the tetrahymena research
this summer, Uhlenllopp's group will be
attempting to determine the nature oi the
repair mechanism iii these cells
Uhlcnhopp believes them to he enzymes

Other experiments will examine iactors
which inhibit or induce repair potential
For example. in recent tests, it was
observed that "cycltlheximlile and cat.
teine each inhibit the return to higti
molecular weights during the repair pro
cess The diiterences in inhibition tenden-
cics oi these and other dings will be Ills
vestigated

Conversely. experiments will be con
ducted to determine which intensities oi
the sniail "tickle doses" oi erays best
boost the mending process.

Professor uhlenhopp obtained one oi the
viscoelastometers to be used tor these pro
Jects while a graduate student at the
University oi Caliiornia at San Diego,
where he helped construct the iirstsuch inc
strument He returned to ucso two years
ago on sabbatical, and sent pieces ot a
newer model back to Gi-innell. where it
was assembled by a chemistry student.

Uhlenhopp's other interests include pro-

blems ol protelnrDNA interaction. such as
"how proteins recognize parts oi the
helix.” studies oi the threerdimensional
structure oi DNA. and advances in genetic

engineering and biotechnology. He, will

soon be attending a conierence in
Washington, D.C.. on the chemical aspects
or biotechnology

said. will enable the researchers to be
much more detailed In their pursuit of
these and future studies

Mr. Erickson said that if he'd had one
wtsh to fulfill his present research

endeavors it would be "to have a highrlield'

nmr spectrometer " Now that he has one.
he says he is equipped tor his research an

is looking lorward to taking advantage c

sitive. it takes auhile to get used to work

He said all the reactions ,will be run

Biagionl Icels that summer research is a
good experience tor the students as "you
can probably learn as much during one
summer as you could during most at one
semester."
