Coach’s decision called sexist

by Robert Quashie

“I began an inquiry about my
participation on the inter.
collegiate baseball team in mid-
October. 1933. At that time. I ex-
pressed my intent of playing
baseball to Coach Martinek, He
told me that there was a softball
team with which i could play 1ex~
plained that my desire was to play
baseball. not softball,"

So began the letter of grievance
which Mary Jane Constant filed in
the office of Affirmative Action.
Tuesday. April 3.

Constant. a junior from New
York City. and backed by five
years or experience in baseball.
was taken off the Grinnell Squad
for reasons which she feels were
sexist.

Constant holds that her main
desire was to play baseball but ads
mits in her letter that, “My par.
ticipation in a traditionally male
sport challenged the stereotyped
attitude about the potential of
women athletes."

She narrates in her letter that
Martinek. in justification of his
decision. told her that her skills
were not up to the necessary level.
More expllci v. Martinek said
that as a junior She did not
demonstrate the ability to com-
pete on a varsity level but that be
ing a Junior eliminated her from
competing on the Junior Varsity.
The J.V. baseball squad is a
“grooming ground" for freshmen
and sophomores. This is not a
school policy but one that is leit up
to the discretion of the individual
coaches.

Coach Martinek does not feel
that it is appropriate to offer com~
ment at this time,

According to Constant's letter,
when she first approached Marc
hook in October, he responded
that he would inquire into the Na»
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa»
tion (NCAA) rules on the matter.
Within a few days she received a
letter which instructed her to
meet with College Athletic Direc-
tor Joh Piitsch. who tried to per
suade her to play soltball. Pfitsch
then oiiered to check the rulings.

She was iniormed by another
coach that the NCAA ruling states
that a male or female could not
participate in a sport ii there was
a comparable sport designated for
their sex, That is, a man could not
go out for women’s track because
track is offered for men.

The NCAA ruled that softball
and baseball were not comparable
sports.

Constant informed Martinek in
December that she would be out
for the team. Her letter states that
he told her that some of the
players expressed concern that
she might be a disruption. Her
response was that she had
demonstrated that she was a
“serious" and “devoted” athlete
through her participation in field
hockey and swimming.

In slight contradiction to what
Constant reports. baseball player
Chuck Blomquist commented.
“The players felt that she had the
right to go out for the team as long
as she proved herself on the play
ing held; her being a woman was
not a major issue."

The“. Spring of
the year brings...

Outdoor Track

Both the men's and ,women's
track teams will be officially
opening their outdoor seasons
tomorrow on Les Duke Track,
here in balmy Grin City.

Both squads will be competing
in triangles. The women will face
Dubuque and William Penn and
the men will battle William Penn
and the Ambassador Track Club
from Nassau, the Bahamas.

in a meet which is being held in
conjunction with the Sports Sym-
posium. the women are expected
to fare better than the men. The

momentum from their Champion-V

ship finish in the indoor season
should give the women the can
tidence to polish off the competi-
tion.

The men should have a tougher
time. Memory tells me that last
year about this time, a certain
team from The Bahamas greeted
with drizzly Weather — with socks
on their hands and caps on their
heads — managed to burn holes in
a certain track. This came even
after a night or hard bipping and
hopping in Younker lounge,

The meet should be a good way
to get into the outdoor spirit and,
some of the Ambassadors are
even more charismatic than
Roger Bannister: Ask for the one
called “Easy”.

The golf team begins play April
13 and id at the William Penn In-

vitational. Ron Taylor returns to
the team with the lowest stroke

average of those who played last
year. Ron is accompanied by six
other returning teammates,

Rick Jaacks will probably begin
the season as the second man.
Wayne Huebener, if he plays in his
normally consistent fashion, will
probably start out behind Rick.

The next three players, Mike
Bianchi, Steve Rowe and Jack'
Hartung, begin the season
grouped together with John Egan
waiting not too far behind.

There may be as many as six or
seven others trying out for the
team. At this point, the new
players are big question marks to
Coach Ed Bowers, who has only
had a couple of chances to see
them play.

in general, the team is fairly ex~
perienced, but whether this ex
perience can help move them
above recent lastrplace iinishes in
the conference remains to be
seen.

 

The swimming season overlap»
ped with the start of baseball
practice, but Constant attended
live of the first practices, even
after Martinek, according to the
letter. intormed her that the first
practices were just for condition-
ing and that she had an obligation
to finish the swim season as did
the basketball players who also
played baseball,

After the conclusion of the swim
season, she attended every prac-
tice (Feb. 27-March 7). On March
8, Martinek informed her that she
would be better olf playing soft»
ball, His reasons, according to
Constant's letter. were: He had
decided on an eighteen player
roster 7 she was twenty-fourth;
she was overpowered on the field;
and her junior status excluded her
from participation on the J.V.
squad. His final reason, and ac-
cording to Constant his main
reason for putting her oil. was
that her presence was a disruption
to the other players' concentra
tion.

A player who chose not to be
named is quoted as saying. “extra
concesswns had to be made for
her in practice. For example. she
had to be given special pitching in-
struction time which could have
been given to more experienced
players,"

March 12th, Constant and Mar-
tinek had another meeting during
which she explained that She felt
his reasons had a sexist basis.

They again discussed the issues of
her skills and Junior status. The
letter states that Martinek gave
her “an ‘A' for effort" but held the
practices she missed at the begin.
ning of the season against her
After Constant asked. Martinek
told her that he had only cut two
players. not six, and those were
out because of their “disruptive
presence" not their limited
facilities.

Constant concludes her letter:
“The discrimination underlying

the obstacles I encountered
throughout the process of going
out for the baseball team
solidified and surfaced in the act
of and the reasons for Martinek
expelling me from the team, My
grievance is that l was kicked off
the team for unjust reasons. One
should not be excluded from a
team because his/her presence 7
whether it is black. female.
hispanic or differently abled — is
distracting to other team

i hope everyone has enjoyed Hie
Symposium so lar and if. you
didn't, i hope it has afforded you
the chance to gain a little more in—
sight into aﬁiletics than the obser-
vation that “All athletes are
jocks."

One group that may have not en-
joyed the Symposium could be the
women on campus. In terms of
speakers on the panels, they were
shortchanged and the silent pro-
test outside Darby was a waste.
Why was it silent? I hope to see
some letters in OP-Ed next week.

Also shortchanged was that

'nagging special interest group of

students who are here to go to
classes during the day. The
schedule makes one wonder if the
event was planned as an enrich-
ment for the campus community
or as a media event/leather in
George Drake's cap. ‘ '

Another group which has been
left out of this Symposium are the
athletes who are actually come
peting today. It was an admirable
accomplishment when the four
minute mile was broken, thirty
years ago, but today runners who
cannot run a sub»four minute mile
[[1 ight as well go out for golf. More
importantly, the athletes of today
are faced with a different set of
pressures than those of bygone
eras. Bannister was able to train
for about an hour a day, without
someone goading him to take
steroids, without advertizers
Soliciting his person. neither did
he have the dollar or pound Sign
waving before his nose.

I’m sure there are a few are
ticulate athletes currently Coma
peting who would have loved the
opportunity to make a statement
about their own profession. .

Lest we forget, there are a few
good things about having this
Symposium on Grinnell ground.
Grinnell College is actually mak-
ing history. There has never been
a gathering or this type of
American soil, so yea calendar-
makers of the future: Take note.

it may not have been ‘besl' but
we were first.

Some aspects of the sporting
world. have been put into the pro
per perspective. here in' the land
or “The Hawkeyes” that is an ac-
complishment.

We Grinnell students have been
reminded that there is a world out
there. where there still exist a few
heroes (nobody asked for any
autographs did theyt). I got a
thrill out or meeting Alan Page
but because or printing schedules.
you will have to read aboutthat,
andeverything else. next week.
