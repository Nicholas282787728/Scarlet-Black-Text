The time has come lor the
Scarlet and Black _ its editors,
reporters, and contributors — to
decide whether we are going to
publish a serious journal bl news
and opinions or a halirhearted at
tempt to inform the campus com-
munity with poorly written news

stories and impertinent editorials.
This is a topic about which I have
lelt compelled to write ior some
time. but i think that my opinion on
the matter will have more conse
quence now that I have experience
on the stall oi the paper.

The event that motivated me to
write about my dissatislaction was
last weeks 5 and B. That was
perhaps .the most important issue
oi the paper in recent Grinnell
history. This was due to the
Speakeasy and the subsequent
questions it raised about racism on
campus. There were seven articles
in that issue that dealt with the
Speakeasy and/or racism. The on»
ly one that mentioned the tact that
there were any white students on
the Speakeasy panel (there were in
iact twoi was my own, because I
wrote about the event irom the
standpoint ot being involved in it

There seemed to be a sporadic
sentiment around campus, prior to
the Speakeasy, that it was going to
involve some black students com-
plaining about a nonexistent pres
blem. I think that attitude pro-
bably kept a good number oi
students irom attending the pro

gram. Those oi us who were there
came away educated, symr
pathetic, and, ideally, motivated to
change the attitudes ol those
unaware oi the problem oi racism.
Those who weren't there could
have heard about it irom iriends.
but it was laid out in iront oi them
in the s and B. Due to the his
complete reporting oi the event,
some or these people still had the
misconception that the Speakeasy
was a uniracial iorum Isaid at the
open iorum on Wednesday that it is
,white people who bring about
change in society. The people who
didn't bother to attend the
Speakeasy because oi disinterest
in the black cause will probably not
be motivated to change this racist

society, but they will be even less
likely to do so it they aren’t aware
oi any “fellow" whites involved in
the eliort,

I’m not even close to being
tinished yet. I made an issue oi last
week's misreporting because it
was timely and pertinent, but it
was certainly not the lirst time
that our reporters have been guilty
oi the oilense. An area that is per
sonal to me is the sports page. The
disdainiul attitude with which
most ol the campus views our
athletic programs is well known. 1
used to be guilty oi it myseli, But
since i have become involved with

grains, the apathy with which they
are regarded has become increas
ingly irustrating. There are many
reasons for this, and I will devote
an entire column or series at coir
umns to the issue at some point,
but my focus here is on the S and B,
i read an account of one of the loot
ball games last year that didn't in
clude the final score. Often. the
stories are centered around that
reporter‘s lriendlst on the team
rather than on what is happening
on the field. Humor is fine, but
many articles, especially this
year, simply mock the given pro»
gram. We, as athletes, realize that
we are never going to be an
athletically powerful school. But
we enjoy the game enough to put
up with the losing seasons, the
derisive label oi “Jocks," and the
academic conflicts We should at.
least be able to expect some sup-
port irom the media

Finally, I would like to touch on
the opinion columns. Except lor
the occasional ”hell" or ”damn," I
don't use obscenities in my cola
umns. It you want to hear mel
swear, come by my room ,
sometime. I‘ve elevated it to an art '
iorm But ii this paper is intent
upon reporting the news in a l
serious manner and publishing
pertinent editorials, then it should
eliminate the superiluous musings
of some would-be radicals Sam’s
Music Scan is one thing; he's
reviewing records, But I couldn't
care less about Brian Berger's Top
Ten. Top Ten what? Write about ‘
something that aiiects me and ,
leave the language but of it. As for
the movie reviews: I'd rather that
they be rated aiter they've been
aired. Give an unbiased account of
the plat of “Road Warrior", I’ll
choose whether or not to see it, and
then I’ll decide if I‘m adult enough
to keep irom “raping (my) mother
and ramming a knitting needle
through tmyt iather's ear.”

 

Editor:

My letter has two purposes
which are, sadly, very paradoxical
ol one another. First, 1 use your
paper to publicly apologize ior ac-
tions 1 ieel responsible ior. Second,
I condemn that very paper which
makes me ieel the necessity oi a
public apology Getting speciiic. i
am talking about Grant Ehrlich's
”articles” on the men’s Cross-
country team which have become
so uncontrolled and exaggerated
under the guise at being ”fun” that
they have oliended many readers
of the S and B as well as degraded
our team. I also condemn the
Scarlet and Black ior being so
opulent and lazy that it could
become so diseased with such lilth
without lighting back and disallow-
ing such misreporting. Yes, this is
strong language, but no, I do not
mean it to be cleverly sarcastic, or
exaggerating a point. I mean this
sincerely. I mean this with a
irustration i can no longer contain
in good conscience.

The first article on the men's
cross-country team or the year was
written by the dearly missed Hugh
Sanders. it quoted me as saying,
”This year we want to concentrate
on discipline, honor, and especially
pride, pride in our team and pride
in ourselves.” Anyone who knows
me Well knows that I care about
the crosscbunlry team and the
values behind the team which
make it much more than a sport to
me. I also believe that caring is the
only path to reaching a potential
talked about by many but dared by
very iew, I meant what i said
about pride.

Since that initial article, no men-
tion of that attitude has been Seen
in the S and B, Did you realize that
the cross-country team won its
meet two weeks ago, or that last
week several JV runners ran the
best times of their lives? These
[acts and that attitude have been
undercut by the attempt of Grant
Ehrlich to report on the “fun"
things the team does Besides perr
sonally diiiering with Grant on the
definition of "fun", I find that
Grant is upsetting the balance or
Grinnell doctrine. Always beiore
we balance hard work with fun and
agree that it takes both to become
a complete, successiul team, In
this balance the Grinnell cross
country team carries the honor G
and represents Grinnell College to
the conierence, alumni. parents,
and in Iact, the nation. In the
perversion oi this balance. Grant is
launching an attack at our
representation by using the widely
read S and B to portray the team as
a bunch of immature, uncaring.
iun fanatics to the entire reader

\most runners

ship. Not only does this reporting
ruin the balance by not mentioning
the accomplishments oi the team.
it goes to the extreme by misinterr
preting the spirit in which the ma-
jority oi runners have fun. In iact,
including myseli
downplay and discourage that
behavior which Grant chooses to
highlight and exaggerate to
ridiculous proportions.

Where does the apology come in?
l, on behali oi myseliand the Grinr
nell cross—country running pro-
gram, apologize lor the {act that
Grant Ehrlich, a team member,
has not been taught the iull mean
ing behind our program and has
not been instilled with the pride our
program tries to embody.

Now the criticism comes in. I
have heard that the sports page is
allowed to be so incredibly horrible
because when readers get angry
they read more. “Readership is
up" is the rationalization I hear to
my laments about the paper. The
Grinnell Herald Register has a
vow on their wall. Part oi it reads,
“Armoury oi iearless truth against
whispering rumour." Also, words
are “fixed in time, havmg been
verified by proof," And, “friend
you stand on sacred ground, this is
a printing oilice." Do these words
mean anything to the Scarlet and
Black? liind this vow very similar
to my attitude concerning cross
country. Why do you let yourselves
as a paper have so little pride and
purpose that you allow such
chronically bad and misinfor»
mative reporting to be put forth?
Are you satisiied with gaining only
angry readers instead oi reliability
or truth? in my eyes, not only do
you allow shame to come to us, but
to yourselves as well.

in conclusion, I am sincerely
asking ior Grant Ehrlich to no
longer report on the cross country
team, i am also asking May-lee
Chat and Eric Schneider to
become more prideiul in their
work. i cannot bring about any ei-
iect by boycotting the paper
because in reality I have already
paid ior it through my activity iee
That iee, amounting to $11,000 oi
student money given to you in ad
vance, and the right oi “lreedom at
the press” gives you considerable
power and liberty. Please
remember that power is corruptir
ble and liberty is not just lreedom
but the responsibility to preserve
that right. I will do my best to
educate the members of my pro-
gram and represent Grinnell Col-
lege the best we can i ask you do
the same. Thank you ior printing
this letter. a Gregory D. Eiaiis.

Ex-Cyclone
editors

explain the

quality of \
yearbook

To the Edito ,

We, the Editorrlanhiei and Copy
Editor of the 1987 Cyclone, would
like to respond to and reiute many
oi the claims put iorth by Misses
Just, Chu, and Foley in their letter
of October 2. Although at a disadr
vantage because we have not yet
been able to view the book, we feel
secure in our knowledge oi the long
hours and commitment that went
into its production. We would also
like to take this opportunity to
comment on the timing oi the
photographers' attack, which
comes when all of the editors ex-
cept the photography editor are out
or Grinnell and have had no oppor
tunity to see the iinal book or pro-
perly deiend themselves,

It is our belief that the
photographers have
misrepresented the amount or tel»
fort and time they put into the
yearbook. Aluiough they claim to
have provided adequate pictures oi
all aspects oi the college. we were
uilen faced with a lack. both in
quantity and variety, oi pictures
from which to choose, The claim
that “there were pictures in our
files much better than the ones in-
cluded in the book” is simply lalse.
The photographers were instructed
time and time again by the editor
to obtain the eight missing iaculty
Shots cited in their letter. By the
end Di the year, these were still not
lorthcoming. and we were iorced
to omit them irom the yearbook.
The Same is true in the cases of the
ol'ircampus houses and campus
speakers.

As ior sports pictures, we owe a
great debt not to the stall
photographers whose job it was to
get them, but to the Sports lnlorr
mation stall. Midway through the
year, it was realized that the year
book photographers were obvious»
1y unable to Iuliill this aspect of
their duties, However, some club
sports pictures, like the rugby
team's, were in tact taken by our
stall photographers. We decided to
censor the rugby pictures because
we wished to include the group. but
had been told by Jostens Yearbook
Company representative Steve
Adair that the book would be un»
printable ii the gestures remained
Although the stall photographers
claim to have provided other shots
of the team, we were not aware of
the existence oi any alternative
photos. The “horriiylng..insens
sitivity“ and “immaturity” of this
judgment is a result not oi
prudishness or otiense, but rather
an attempt to present the rugby
team's pictures with some amount
at humor.

efforts to produce the book by the
photographers' consistent
disregard ior recording the content
