Second half letdown dooms soccer team for loss

by Kim MacDonald

Looking for their fifth victory in a row
over the Universlty of Wisconsin-
Platteville, the soccer team was defeated ‘
by an improved opponent and fell to a i-2
record so far this year.

Although Grinnell started out strong,
with lorward Eric Pedicini scoring in the
iirst tive minutes or play, the Pioneers
could not hold onto their lead in the second
half.

Platteville tied the game 1-1 on a direct
kick when Chris Carls was called for
pushing an opponent in the penalty area.
Since Caris was neither tlagrantly being
rough and the player was not in control of
the ball, another player called it a “touchy
call."

Platteville took the lead late in the
game when a corner kick bounced off a
Grinnell player's foot, The Grinnell player
was trying to clear the shot, but kicked it
the wrong way.

The Pioneers trounced Platteville the
past four years, but attribute their loss this
weekend in part to a great improvement
on the part of their opponent, “Our com-
petition is improving at a very last rate,"
noted goalie Greg Donovan.

In addition, only four of die 11 man star-
ting lineup for Grinnell are playing the
same positions as last year. Because a lot
of starters graduated last year, the lineup
was l‘ﬁl’lufﬂed, “to fit the team best," ac-
cording to halfback Jim lndiveri. “There's
a lot of experience, a lot of juniors," he ad-

ded.

Donovan echoed this sentiment. “We're
having a hard time adjusting to the loss of
players trom last year since many players
aren't playing their old positions." Game
experience is not a factor in the Pioneer's
recent losses since only two starters have
no varsity experience.

in addition to playing new positions, the
team changed their offensive field align
ment. Instead of two halfbacks and four
forwards, there are now three of each, The
defensive set remains the same. This new
system was developed to create more
strength in the midfield. The team is also
working more at “running a man off,” to
get an opponent to run the opposite way,
According to Indiveri, running off worked
well in the second half.

Some spectators at the game felt the
team was out of condition, According to In-
diVeri. ”Some people Said we looked like
we dropped dead, but conditioning was not
a probleml . . no one Was tired.” Lack of
teamwork and mental errors may have
been responsible for the let down since me
team worked hard on conditioning the
week before.

obviously, die problems in Saturday’s
game were more apparent in the second
half of the game. of the first half, Indivieri
noted, “I've never seen a Grinnell team in
the four years I've been here move the ball
that well,"

In general, there doesn’t appear to be a

lack of talent on this year's team. One
player cited Rex 0sae, new to the varsity,
as a “tremendous asset. . . He has incredi—
ble dribbling ability.” In general the team
relies on quickness. Bill Schumann and
Pedieini are fast wings, and Satoshi
