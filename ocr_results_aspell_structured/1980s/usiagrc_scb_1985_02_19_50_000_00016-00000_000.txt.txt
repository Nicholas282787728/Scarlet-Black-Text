witness. yet again. the political posturing
and fiscal sophistry that is the Congress'
budget debate, There is much talk about
”needed" vs, “unnecessary" program; or
hurting the middle class, the poor, the
disabled; of longrtei'm vs. shortrterm; and
of “guns" vs. “butter.” But while the
politicians of both parties seize the oppor-
tunity to accuse one another of fiscal
depravity, an important document goes
unnoticed, a document which should be at
the forefront of the effort to trim the
deficxt That document is the report of the
President’s Private Sector Survey on Cost
Control, otherwide known as the Grace
Commission's Report.

’ In l982 President Reagan commissioned
J Peter Grace to head a committee to ex-
amine the eiiiciency oi uie iederal governr

million W.R, Grace CD. into a 3.9 billion
conglomerate. is recognized as one of
America’s top business leaders An “im-
moral capitalist” he may be. but Mr,
Grace is. nevertheless. an expert on effi-
ciency. liis Zoourmember volunteer com-
mission compiled 23.000 pages oi reporLs
and recommendations at an estimated
cost of seventyrfive million dollars' worth
otiabor, all oiwhich was donated gratis by
the commission’s members. Their final
report painted a picture of a government
which spends money handover-fist in
ways which few of us would call justified.

They began by examining the amount
paid-by the government icr oiiice space.
only to iind that no one in the government
knew how much oiiice space the govern
ment had, let alone how much was paid for
it‘ Undaunted, volunteers across the coun
try bolted up federal offices and invaded
them with tape measures. The result? The
iederal government rents iour times as
iniich office space as is available to rent in
the four largest us cities. We may need the
rooln. but we don’t need the price 7 the
Commission also found that the govern
ment pays fourteen times more than the
going rate for office space.

The waste doesn't stop there. The feds
use 332 diilerent accounting systems, 123
of which are not approved by the govern.
ment itself, thus making it impossible to
iully examine government accounts for
waste and irregularities. The government

iederal oiiice must be maintained to comb

costs result irom the fact that many or
these computers are incompatible with
each other, making it impossible to share
miormation or coordinate activity, For ex

shouldn’t receive them — all or them were
deceased. Not surprisingly the commisn
sion estimates that updating the iederal
computer system would eventually save
billions oi dollars

The government also wastes money on
subsidies. Electricity in the North West
Pacific area costs onehali What the rest of
the country pays because the iederal
government runs most or the generating
stations there and usesitax dollars to keep
the price artificially low, Should the area’s
power facilities be sold to conventional
utilities, the government would relieve

What explains this neglect? Perhaps ivlr,‘
Grace put it best when he responded to,
outraged cries irom congressmen defenr
ding the civil service irom accusations ot-
waste and ineiiiciency. to wit: "When you
stick a pig, it screams." The Grace Com-‘
mission's report has. apparently. “stuck".
Congress. which has responded with a
deaiening “scream” oi silence and inacq
tion. For over twenty years both parties
have labored to create the sprawling.’
money-eating machine oi the iederal_
government without bothering to stop and
see it their vast outlays oi dollars were be-
ing spent well and accounted for. The
Grace report has shown both parties to he'
dilatory in their spending and managing oi,
the people's money. It's recommendations
should be implemented post haste.
