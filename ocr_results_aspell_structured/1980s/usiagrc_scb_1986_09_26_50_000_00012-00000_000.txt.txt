With high unemployment in Papua New
Guinea. some young Papuans have formed
“rascal gangs" which attack and rob the
expatriate community as well as their own
people, Carole says there is racism in
Papua New‘Guinea but it is not strongly
defined. New Guineans consider baring
the body immoral and Westerners have to
be careful about their choice of clothes. “I
would never wear a skim y top or shorts
anywhere except my bac yard because
then you‘re just asking people to get the
wrong idea."

Carole misses the Lao climate 7 "we‘re
only 61.2 degrees off the equator and I love
the heat" _ but says she is looking {or
vied to seeing snow for the first time.
Some of the most outstanding quirks of
American living have included the shower
taps (that’s faucets in BritishaAustralian
English) turning upward and American
slang, “which I don't really understand
but as I’m loathe to admit it, I just pretend
I do."

“Financial aid and the academic quali-
ty,” was how Jacqueline Looi from
Malaysia encapsulated her reasons for
selecting Grinnell College.

The biggest difference Jacqueline finds
at the college is the way subjects are
taught. “In Malaysia, we have goals we’re
working towards, such as special exams
every two years. As a result, in high school
we were spoon fed intormation as we had,
to cover a wide range of subjects in a short
peroid of time. At Grinnell, I find that I
have to get most oi the intormation myseli,
which is a vast change ior me."

Social life at Grinnell is also unusual
when compared with her homeland. “Peas
ple here just seem to go to parties to get
drunk while in Malaysia eople tend to
stay sober to enjoy themse ves."

She also believes that Americans are
friendly but there seems to be a lot of
,supe iciality to relationships here. “Peo—

‘Tle are always asking ”hoW’are you?” and
things like that but sometimes they don’t
really seem very sincere. In my opinion,
Malaysian people are less demonstrative
but they care more about you as a person,
they just don’t show it as much.”

Jacqueline says she enjoys having an

equal balance of new American friends
and fellow ISO students with whom she can
discuss mutual problems and experiences.

“At this point in my lite, things couldn’t
be better, everything is like a giit,” said
Agniezska Ryzinska, the first Swedish
citizen ever enrolled at Grinnell.

Aggie, as she likes to be called, spent a
year in Battle Creek Michigan iive years
ago on the Youth For Understanding ms
gram. After moving to Sweden she wor ed

or three years as a nursery school atten-

dant, a hospital worker, and an assistant in
an old people’s home. She decided to apply
to me SwedishaAmerican Foundation, an
organization which selects suitable
Swedish students to study in the U.S. by
their test scores and applications and then
distributes their names to US. colleges,
because “I wanted to study many ditierent
subjects without a, determined focus,
something which isn‘t possible in
Sweden.”

Aggie hails irom Stockholm. She was
pleasantly surprised that the Grinnell
campus was not as small and boring as she
had expected. The people and the studies
are also different from what she
remembers in Michigan. “In High School,
everybody was very guarded about
themselves but here we’re all in this
together and it’s more like a community,
And, irankly, I expected the studies to be
very easy like in Michigan and I‘m glad
that they’re not.” Aggie speaks t'luent
Polish and tutors students at Grinnell.

Aggie credits the week»long orientation
for foreign students with helping her adapt
to the Grinnell community. “We discussed
our prejudices and stereotypes of
Americans and that helped me put
everything in perspective, ” said Aggie.
Aggie notes that in Sweden people are
more individualistic and that the goal of a
career is not as important. She also said
that a majority of Swedish young people
are atheists and that “girls dress like boys
and have done so for a very long time”

She believes that although the Swedish
media is smaller than in the 11.5., it is
much more objective. “The television
news and newspapers always show news
from allover the world while I think in the
US, that the news is more concentrated on
national events."

Issues and Perspectives Cont.

American

Americans become less proud of our counr
try or that we pull our troops out oi Ger»
many. Rather I think we need to become
more sensitive to the currents underlying
anti-Americanismr

Germany has come of age. And her new
generation is less willing to wait patiently
until we Americans come to accept that.

Misconceptions

cliches or biased reporting.

The generally more politically
concerned public in Germany is by NO
MEANS willing to forgive Reagan’s Ram-
bo and we-start-nukeingeinsssminutes-
statements, nor are we willing to forget
Granada or Nicaragua (the list may go on
as long as you want). It is simply income
prehensivle to Germans that tewer people
vote lo the US than watch Dallas. 1 mean,
this is the country which is promising the
non-communist world protection! 1 The ima
plication: How are you going to convey to
Joe Farmer in Nebraska that he has to
fight and Sacrifice his life when he does not
even know where the country is that he has
to defend} l?

0n the other hand we are obviously not
willing to iorgive the episodes oi Soviet
‘mlsbehavior’ and the list here may be
equally long, but I was not asked to write
about that subject today.

In general. I believe that the majority of
West Germans feel that the military solu~
tions the superpowers have put iorward in
the past were only problems to our coun»

try, which uniortunately has rich ex-
perience in terror and violence on its own
territory.

Other origins for anti-American senti-
ment might be the difficulties we have in
establishing a just sense of American and
Americans as much as you have problems
getting a undistorted picture oi the Ger-
man society.

The Atlantic Ocean ls not only > a
psychological barrier, but also a financial
one. Thus there is not enough interaction
on the German part Also American
tourists in Europe (40 cities in 15 daysi will
not see much more than architecture, good
beer and bratwurst. I believe that Grinnell
and other schools all over the country have
recognized the need ior cultural exchange
and there are also, thank God, more and
more of such programs here on campus.
And at course, we, the international
students, are always around. always open
for a discussion. Make use of us, grab one
of us and talk to us because we cannot
guess what you are thillking. Thanks ior
listening, Theo Eicher.

“A lot of students think a police officer
doen't have the right to come on campus
unless the college lets them. Wrong!
Under Iowa law, student rooms are
private, but the police have the right to
come on campus at any time," Ahrens
said.

Ahrens also wishes to remind students of
the lowa open container law and of lowa’s
“brother‘s keeper" law, which, in effect,
says that if a person gets drunk at a party,
and injures himseli or others or destroys
property, the person giving the party is
liable for damages.

It is imDortant to note that the
”brothers‘ keeper" law carries a twosyear
statute of limitations, and Ahrens said that

- because Grinnell graduates oiten procure

high-paying jobs, it is not uncommon for
plaintiffs to utilize the statute and wait to
the charges.

An item of particular concern to
underclassmen: Busch said, “You will
probably see more bar ID checks‘than in
the last couple oi years.”

In addition, the police plan to step up
carding at parties.

“Where we usually get involved (with
parties) is with noise complaints," Ahrens
said.

Students may be tempted to take Iowa
law lightly and rationalize that because
they’re so iar away trom home, it doesn’t
matter if they have a Grinnell police
record. However, Ahrens said that each
year, the department receives many re
quests for security clearances irom
graduates who are applying for a job with
the government or corporations such as
DuPont or McDonnellsDouglasr Any blotch
on a graduate's record will hamper the is-
suance of a security clearance.

However, when reﬂecting on the more
positive side oi town-college relations,
Ahrens said, “A lot of people in town feel
like the students are like their own sons or
daughters who might be away and are
usually willing to go out oi their way to
help students here.”

As far as many students are concerned,
the Bakery is as much a part of college liv-
ing as sharing bathrooms and studying at
Burling. (In iact, the graduating class ot
1976 made “The people of the Danish Maid
Bakery” official members of their class.)

Letters “'0'" Page 6

French guy who wanted to o on the ' ”
at GORP tables, he becamge curioustralhd
asked to have a conversation with a trip
leader.

From the iirst conversation came the
sentence: “We are atraid that you would

not tit in within the group because you are
not enthusiastic enough about the trip.”
This non-enthusiastic person felt quite
lonely at the first big mandatory GORP
meeting. It is also interesting to see that a
friend, who was American and who had
convinced this person to come along on the
trip was immediately accepted even
though he had submitted his application
aiter the deadline and the trip was already
at is maximum number of people.

Out of a second conversation came the
more explicit words: “Well, we cannot acV
cept ioreign students based on the fact that
they cannot afford any other trip than with
GORP because it is cheaper.” The purpose
of this letter is not to make people become
more iriendly with toreign students: that
is discrimination too! Foreign students at
Grinnell are like everybody else: they eat
Grinnell's food and take finals as well.

that the two or three sentences Ted allocated
to Sophie‘s problem was anything more than
a humorous aside. Yet Barbara, or her friend
named Barbara, seemed to feel it was proof
that the writer was more concerned about
supermarket media intrigues than about the
real problems facing the world. I have never
met‘Barbarais), but I can tell from her arti»
cle that she has met neither Ted or Sophie,
both oi whom are at the very least, as deep
and as aware as the average Grinnell student.

But that being my own personal bias,
maybe I should produce an example. In his
capacity as SGA president, Ted has been one
of several student government presidents na-
tionwide to sign a strongly worded letter call-
ing for President Reagan to impose economic
sanctions against the South African govern-
ment. Ms, Brown, will you concede that tak»
ing a public stand in favor of sanctions more
or less balances a few lines of quasi-gossip? —
