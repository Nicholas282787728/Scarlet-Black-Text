Italian director Federico Fellini's first
color leature, "Juliet oi the Spirits.“ could
neatly be encapsulated as a [any tale base
ed on psychoanalysis Starring Fellini's
wile and layered actress Glulletta
Massina, "Juliet of the Spirits" reveals a
morally bankrupt and stagnant marriage
beneath an externally ideal iacade. The
outstanding problems with the marriage
are the lack of fidelity and reciprocated
love. Fellini cleverly manipulates color by
employing ubiquitious white to indicate

the Spirits

the neutral quality of the marriage. And.
as with many Fellini movies, the iilm
almost glows with solicitude tor the
heroine. Any movie by Fellini. who ranks
with Fraco ZelIirell as the preeminent
director oi the modern Italian cinema. is
north watching so take time out irom your
llnals schedule to see "Juliet oi the
Spirits.“

by Kevm O'Prey

In 1986 film “Something Wild,” director

Lulu tMelanle Griffith) after she sees him
pocket a check at a luncheonette After
threatening to turn him in, Lulu offers
Charlie a ride back to work. When Charlie
accepts. Lulu abducts him. rips oifa liquor
store. and spirits him away (with passive
resistance on his part) to New Jersey. The
plot continues with increasingly more in-
sane antics as the couple races on to Penn
sylvania, Just when you thought that this
would be just another hysterical comedy,
in walks nay, Lulu's psychopathic

boyiriend, who everyone believed was in
prison Ray, needless to say, is not happy
about Lulu's yuppie side-kick and is likely
to do something about it,

I probably cannot do this him justice
here as I have not seen it. Suffice it to say,
however. everyone i know who has seen
this film lhinks that it Is wonderIul. The
critics loved "Something Wild" as well.
The soundtrack is by John Cale, with
David Byrne. Laurie Anderson. the
reelies. and a host ot others it you are
looking to get out of a finals»\veek rut, or it
you just want to have a good time. go see
