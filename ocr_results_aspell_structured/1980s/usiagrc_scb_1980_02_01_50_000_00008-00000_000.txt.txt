 

Attractive alternative: off-campus

by Andrew Schultz

Let's say you and a group ot your
triends are dulcimervplaying
lepidopterists who speak occasionally
in Esperanto and enjoy vegetarian
cuisine. Let us go further and add that
you and your friends do not care to
live in the dorms anymore,

it you can sutter through the
labyrinthine process, you and your
triends could form a coop project
house and live in the splendor and
elegance ot the off-campus world
without the hassle of impending rents,
untrustworthy landlords, and long

nights.

The tirst step toward getting a
collegeowned, off-campus house IS to
organize. The application deadline is
traditionally the Friday heiore spring
break and this year's deadline is Fri-
day, March 14, Director of Housing
Susan Wittpenn advises groups to get
together as soon as possible. Groups
must turn in signed contracts for each
member including a 325 damage
deposit. Each group must also have
two alternates with signed contracts,
but these alternates need not pay the

should get together to discuss the
goals of their project. They need to
choose a coordinator and have this
person compose a written proposal oi
the plans tor the group project.

The written proposal is turned in
with the contracts and the money. It is
this proposal that is taken up by the
Housing Committee. The committee is
chaired by Wittpenn and has student
and resident adviser members. After
break, the committee meets with each
group coordinator to discuss their in-
dividual proposal. Coordinators are

walks to campus on bitter winter deposit.

While organizing, group members

asked to elaborate on the group plans
and the committee eventually chooses

Project houses: tradition of creativity

by Kathy Wit/hone

Language houses—French, German, Russmn, and
Spanish Housesiare perennial favorites. Members
speak the language over meals or during conversation
hours, cook ethnic food, and plan weekends (or the cam-
pus. otten the language department's assistant lives in
the project house as well.

Other project houses have included Music House,
Medication House, and Philosophy House.

Formerly, a iaculty sponsor was required for groups
to obtain a house, but although language houses still
tend to have close contact with faculty members, that
requirement has proved unnecessary and has been drop»
ped within the last few years. says wittpenn.

Some houses, such as Random House and Pine Tree
House in the past and this year's Dada House and ll
Manzo House, had no uniting theme or cause, the
members simply wished to live and in some cases cook
together.

whereas formerly groups with projects were given
preference {or off-campus housing, acccordmg to Witt~
penn that is no longer the case. Groups oi students who
simply want to live together are now as likely to draw
an oft-campus house as groups with that “common in-
terest."

whether project houses are more cohesive than those
with no uniting theme is an unansweraole question,
Tedcrman points out that many off-campus houses have
not worked out over the years, and he believes that,
“The best living situation in houses is when there‘s a
binding reason tor it.” Wittpenn says, however, that, in
response to the 197980 housing survey, most students

think their houses are Working out Very well, and that
non-project houses seem to be working out just as well
as nroiect houses,

Crazy House, Town House, Audubon House, Bohemian
House: Each isior was—a “Project house." That isI a
housetul of people who share common interests and who
“want uie opportunity to share their experlences/acn
tivities with the entire campus community.”

Project houses are collegeowned and may or may not
be coops.

The first two project houses were lormed in the [all of
1959, according to Jim Tederman, Dean of student Af»
fairs: German House tin what is now Nollen House) and
the all-female Conference House, which brought con-
ferences on timely issues such as women and drugs to
campus,

As Grinnell's enrollment escalated in the early 1970's,
new collegevowned off-campus houses were opened up.
Co—op living in particular was very popular a decade
ago, says Tederman, for the commune concept was an
intrinsic part of the student culture, Vegetarianism was
growing, and dorms then had more regulations than
houses,

Past group projects ranged from the wacky to the
educational.

The purpose behind Crazy House in 1973 was “To do
crazy things,” says Susie Wittpenn, Assistant Dean of
Students. ”It was nothing destructive or harmlul...they
would stick iollipops in the ground in central campus or
dress up as cheerleaders and go to games." Street par-
ties and snow sculpturing were also part or their
craziness, recalls Tederman. But the house undeserved-
ly earned a bad name when a student claimed that the
popcorn balls,which house members were dispensing on
Halloween, were laced with LSD~a claim which later
proved to be false.

One year, a group iormed Town House. its purpose
was to learn about the town of Grinnell—to bring
townspeople in tor study breaks and to move toward im~
proving Towanown relations. Although it “never works
ed out very well,” says wittpenn, it was a constructive
idea.

Audubon House (“Bird House”) used to sponsor an
Environmental Awareness Weekend, and GORP House
planned outdoor activities for the whole campus.

The members of this year’s Bohemian House are ar-
tIStS of various kinds who seek the ”relaxed creative atv
mosphere" of the Greenwich Village coffee house.

Vegetarianism is oiten an impetus behind co-op pro»
ject houses. last year, Green House iormed to learn
more about veggie cooking. They made special dinners
and held informational meetings for non-house members
as well.
