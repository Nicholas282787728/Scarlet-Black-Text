Simon Levin

Dearest Grinncllians,

My name is Simon Levin. After
some frustration with the current
state of affairs at Grinnell, and
much consideration, I have de-
cided to run for SGA president.

The first issue on campus that
concernsmeistheserv-
ices provided by the
GrinnellCollcch—lealth ,

Center. Earltcrlhisyear

live proposing that the ‘
health center provide
servrccs on Weekends.

The two-day lag in
medical care is danger-
ous,andtraiisportations

and ﬁnancial limita-

tions prevent students ‘
from sccking nc

aid. The init tive .
passed 625 to 49 and .
yet the administration chCClCd it
as “unfeaSible.”

This semester I am supporting

health fee by about 90- dollars,
perhaps less with alumni dona»

A second concern of mine is

And finally, I would like to
change the altitude of the student
government itself. In my experi-
ence with the health-center initia-
tive, I found that although it won
and showed that thiswas the desire
of the students, I was alone in my
dealings with the administration.
SGA did not Support the initiative
and, in effect, the will of the stu-
dent body in making this a reality.
So this brings me to my first cam-
paign promise, here we go. . .. “If
elected president of SGA, I will
make it my duty to back all student
initiatives that pass with the full
weightofthc studcnigovcmmeni."
Well there you have it. At the
very least it is an idea of what I
stand behind. I am very open to

Shout out my name and stop me
sometime if you have any sugges-
tions about what you would like to
see changed here at Grinnell.

Why (you may ask) do I want to
be president? An in. able necd
for power? All inexhaustible lust
for glory? Not really. I'm afraid
someone who truly desires power
and glory would be pretty disap-
pointed with tiny SGA position,
including the presidency. One of
the most common tnisperceptions
aboiit the president is thats/tie has
more “power” than that of the
average student. 1 call it the ”If I
were SGA president the college
would neverget away With [fill in
the blankl” syndrome. Reality,
unfortunatcty, isn't quite that
simple. A person ctin only be an
effective president if s/he has the
appropriate skills and experience
to compensate for ttic position‘s
lack of inherent power. I have
both the skills Intl experience
necessary.

ects. To some extent that’s truezl
certainly have some proyccts in
mind for next year. What people
don’t realize is that there are hun-
dreds ol little bureaucratic tasks
that the president (and Vice-presi-
dent) must perform weekly. As
vieerpresident, I spend countless
hours answering computer mes-
sages, planning meetings, comr
posing agenda packets, schedul~
ing open forums. working on
campus problems senators relay
to us, not to mention attending
numerous SGA and college com-
mittee meetings. Lastweek alone
I attended to meetings, each of
which lasted anywhere from 45
minutes to two hours. Don’tmis-
understand me, though: I actually
tikc this part of thejob. My point
is that it's easy for someone with
no previous knowledge of the
position lobe overwhelmed by the
bureaucracy tlnd entl up htiutng
neither the time nor ttic will to
accomplish anything substantial.
I have ti full grasp of college hu-
rcaiicracy and have spent the past
year using that knowledge on
behalf of the student body.
In addition, this year SGA has
attempted to educate the student
body about college bureaucracy

and increase campus COIItmunir
cation in general. A mayor con
corn in my. car’s election was
the is e of communication (or
rzitllerlztck thereof) between SGA,
the student body. faculty,andad-
ministration. In response to that
need. I scheduled a series of 10

I (and I think SGA
as a whole) have been open to
suggestions from students ex»
pressing concerns to me. even if
they haven't been related to my
“curricular" role its Vice-presi-

Beliefs. This is a

want you to know where I‘m
coming (tom).

I believe that:
1. Students should not wear un-
derwear at least one day a week
(just to see what happens).

2. The endowment should be
equally distributed among students
and faculty. This would come out
to roughly $160,000 per person.

3. Every week the campus should
get together forastngratong. (Nothr

4. Everyoneshottld get free Snicker

bars from the Grill.
5. Students should stop worrytng,
(This only makes life hard and
gives you diarrhea.)

6. Grinnellshouldchangethelogo

thatlogo would not hesitate to apply

During last year‘s campaign I
promised to lobby the board of
tmstecs for more faculty, work
for a gender» and women‘s-stud-
ics concentration, involve stu-
dents in any potential curricular
changes, and produce an SGA
handbook. I did each of these.
That’s about all I have to tell
you, Thanks for wading through
what has bccotrie a rather long
statemcnt. To be honest, I've

particularly enjoy the elections.

more.

IO, SGA members should observe
the adage: “Don't talk unless you
can improve on silence" (Thlswould
simplify SGA meetings and in fact
probably shorten thcm extensively.)
These are my beliefs and Ihope
that you stiare at least a couple of
them. Ifyou do, please vote forme.
If you don't I simply would ttkc to
wish you the best of luck in your
pursuits (but you sure ain't getting
no Cabinet position). But remem-
her, all i am saying is give Froese a
chance. Thank you very much.
