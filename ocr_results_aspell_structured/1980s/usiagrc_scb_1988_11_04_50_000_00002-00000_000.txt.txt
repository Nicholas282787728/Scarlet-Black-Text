County Supervisor

VOTE — ITS YOUR RIGHT

Philip Neofotist, candidate
for County Supervisor on the
Democratic ticket, was born and
raised in Des Moines, Iowa. He
attended Shattuck Military
School and William Penn Col-
lege.

My wife, a Montezuma
native, and I have been married
38 years and have three children,
five grandchildren. five step-
grandchildren and one step-great-

! am a resident of
Poweshiek County and a tax-
payer. I have worked with the
public for 38 years as an owner

I would like to take this
opportunity to introduce myself
to the students at Grinncll Col-
lege. I believe that too often
candidates for local county ofﬁces
do not take th time m gct ac-
quaintcd with the student body
and make voters aware of the
candidates ideas and positions on
local issues.

I am 35 years old and a
graduate of Milligan College in
East Tennessee. My wife Joy
and I have three children. For
nine years we opened our home
to a number of foster children,
mostly young teens. This cx-
pericnce have us adecp appre-
ciation for the struggles that
many families face, especially

of family business and as a Chief ,

Executive Ofﬁcer of 2 mral Iowa
hospitals, I am presently em-
plyed at Mercy Hospital in Des
Moines, Iowa. ‘

I feel thatI understand the
needs of rural Iowa and
Poweshiek County. I am respon-
sible and qualified to hold the
Supervisor position. I will work
for me people and will work full
time.

I would like to list some of
the issues that I have deep con-
cern about;

I. EDUCATION:

We must in the future have
a modern, ﬂexible education sys-
rem that will give us young peo-
ple who are educated to learn and
adapt to the changes that will
come.

2. HEALTH CARE:

Everyone, no matter who
they are, where they come from,
or what age, must have health
insurance and facilities to take
care of their needs.

3. WOMEN'S RIGHTS:

To keep pace with our
changing times, we need to have
rights and opportunities for
women in the area of good jobs,
ages, and reliable day care centers.

If you have questions about
other area of interests. please call
623-3048.

tional and psychological
difficulties. I have served for two
ymrs on the Mental Health Cen»
ter Board of Directors. I have
taken a special interest in the
Center's Community Support
Program. This concept has
proven to be cost effective while
makiong possible a better life for
many of our chronically Men,
tally Ill.

1 have also given a great
deal of time in studying the
alternatives to landﬁlling mu-
nicipal solid waste. Iowa is be-
hind many other states in der
veloping recycling and resource
recovery programs I would
like to see our county take the
lead in exploring an integrated
waste management plan that
would include recycling in each
of our towns with a "drop oft"
system in the rural areas. This
could be done in cooperation with
neighboring counties, such as
Jasper and Iowa.

It has been an honor to
serve the people of Poweshiek
county for the past 4 years I
would appreciate your support as
I seek reelection for a second
term.

If you have any questions
or would like me to address your
group or organization, please call
me at 2367043.
