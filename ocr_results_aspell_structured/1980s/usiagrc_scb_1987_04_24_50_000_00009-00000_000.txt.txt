“As You Like It”:
,“Goofy, gentle satire ”

Knoeptler

" “As You Like It’ is a springtime play,”
explains A.S, Moifett, protessor of theatre
at Grinnell College. "It’s gooiy and great
iun, but Shakespeare also says a lot of
things about the cleansing and miraculous
qualities oilove that make bad people good
and good people better,"

“As You Like It," directed by Moftett.
will be performed Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, April 2&25 at 8:00 pm in
Roberts Theatre.

“The play is a gentle satire on all dil'r
lerent kinds of love,” says Mullen. There
is more than one plot line. but the main ace
tlon of the play centers around Rosalind
and her cousin Celia who are banished
irom the court and run away into the
magical forest of Arden. “In the forest. all

kinds oi crazy things happen. But it’s all
very gentle and playiul. It was written
when Shakespeare was a mature
playwright and he could ieei comtortable
with being playful," Moriett says.

Along with a basically traditional
Elizabethan setting, where the tour dit-
ierent couples tall in love, Motl'ett's pro
duction includes a sprinkling of
recognizably modern costumes,

Actors include Brenda Jensen, as
Rosalind; Jessica Thebus as Celia; Donald
Cotter as Touchstone; ian Roberts as
Orlando; Sean Costello as Jaques; and
Glenn Martin as Oliver.

“Arctic Dreams”

y Todd Francis
Watching the red and pink of a sunset
eilect ott icebergs in the Bering Sea is one
i the most striking scenes of the Arctic
hat Barry Lopez's most recent book.
‘Arctic Dreams.” conveys, as he writes
bout this desolate region of the world
ctermined to share the beauty oi the horn
hern lands and seas that iew people ever
ee, Lopez composed this work which
escribes various facets of the lives of Arc
Ic inhabitants, both animal and human,
his publication expands a career oi suc-
esstul work by the author, including “or
(lives and Men." which was awarded the
ohn Burroughs Medal in 1979

Barry Lopez has spent many years in the
idle. during which time he has collected
oteS and sketches to help him understand
he region. His travels include journeys
’lth the Eskimos, with scientists, and With
rtists in his endeavors to see the Arctic
rom as many perspectives as possible.
lteil iii the book a scene is described in
which the author is seated alone on a field,
y a stream, or atop a cliit, silently wat-
'thg the activities of the animals around
im Many times he describes his attempts
o lose liimseli in his surroundings. to axe
erlence them and the aura he has
iscovered there with his senses

There are three mayor approaches that
open uses to allow the reader to unders-
and the Arctic, First. he uses a biological
erspcctive, selecting a iew uniquely polar
niinals and describing their lives as
iatural history, as well as their interac-
anS with humans throughout history. The
arwhai, Lopez claims. is the source oi
tories about unlcoi'ns that have existed
iiice early times. During much oi the mid-
:lle ages, narwhals were harvested in nor-
liern Europe, wherc their value was low,
nd exported to the south, where the lone
orn (actually an overgrown tooth) took on
Valuable magical medicinal properties. .
Lopez uses anthropolo' ical' and
istorical approaches, as wet. r-or nuns

 

oreds oi years, the Europeans have bee
vlSiting the Arctic, There they found the
wellsadapted Eskimo tribes, visitors wh
Crossed the land bridge from Siberia and
never went back. The whale hunters and
explorers that met the Eskimos marveled
at how these people could live in what, to
their eyes, was a very unpredictable ens
vironment, The Europeans saw the Arctic
largely as a place of rich harvests where
iortunes could be gained by a summer oi
whaling But at the same time, the seas
were filled with the threats oi icebergs and
possible ireeze-ins. and Lopez recounts
various tales oi ships with surVivors who
numbered only a few, or at times none.

Finally, Lopez highlights his essays with
descriptions of the nature of the Arctic, It
is a land of a sinmonth day and a six-
month night, where a sunset can last for
many hours. It is a land where icebergs
hundeds of miles across cleave oil and
float for years on the sea. (Lopez recalls
one iceberg that has been used for twenty-
iive years as a permanent base [or Sclenr
tiﬁc research.) . It is a land of chilling
temperatures that have‘driven out all but
the hardiest of men and beasts But.
because ol all these lactors which are so
foreign to most of us, the Arctic is a land
that still provokes awe and wonder.

The overall purpose oi ”Arctic Dreams"
is to create a sense or respect [or the Arc
tic. Lopez’s slant is one oi conservation:
the Arctic is one of the last wildernesses on
earth, and we Should appreciate that and
try to maintain it. The encroachments of
civilizations have damaged native tribal
lifestyles, destroyed habitats, and
threaten to deprive the woijld ot a land‘of_
glorious isolation. The reader 'is constantly
reminded of the potential in human being:
for destruction. Yet, despite his sometimes
overly critical approach, Lopez succeeds
in relating the majesty and beauty of the
land oi the midnight sun in a style that can
be understood by the layperson as well as
the proiessional.
