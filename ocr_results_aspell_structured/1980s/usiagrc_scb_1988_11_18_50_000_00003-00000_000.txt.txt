SCARLET AND BLACK

Music department works to
change student perceptions

by Beth Wodzinsld

One student, who wishes to
remain anonymous, called the
Grinnell Music Department, "a
complete waste of everyone‘s
time," and said that it is
"frustrating to do anything artisr
tic at Grinnell." Sophomore De-
vani Scheidler said that although
she enjoyed the music courses
she took last semester, she felt
that she "could have learned
more."
It is attitudes like these that
the music department is trying to
change. Department chair Jon
Chenette and other faculty mem-
bers are aware of the department's
negative image on campus. Chen—
ette is relying on increasing
administrative support, the
young, talented and dedicated fac-
ulty, the variety and challenge of
courses offered, the strong en-
semble program. and the number
of talented musicians that come
into Grinnell every year to im-

prove the department

Their efforts are already
succeeding. Freshman music
major Jeff Patmon said that the
music program at Grinnell is
"comparable to a university's
program" Enrollment in the en-
sembles has more than doubled in
the last ﬁve years. Chenette ex-
pects the strength of the depart-
ment to continue to increase.

Chenette feels that the aca»

demic courses offered in the mu~
sic department are more varied
than the courses at many colleges
and universities. Although the
emphasis remains on Western
classical music. courses and an
ensemble devoted to non-Westem
music do exist. Chenettc also
said that the courses have been
revised, making them more rig-
orous academically. The name
"Clapping for Credit" may no
longer apply to Music 111.

"The SGA formulated a
campus smoking policy . . .
Non-Smoking areas shall be
provided in the following places:
Dining halls, fonim coffeehouse,
and the library. Smoking shall
not be permitted at lectures,
seminars or colloquiums held in
South Lounge or Grinnell house}
The policy differs slightly from
the CSL proposed policy, which
does not include the coffeehouse.
but bans smoking during movies
in South Lounge. Both policies
must go to President Turner for
his acceptance or rejection."
