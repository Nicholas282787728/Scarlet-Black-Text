Eric Wynn

by Lisa Ferguson

After a semestcrrlong search,
Grinnell College has gained Eric
Wynn as its new Minority
Affairs director. Wynn fills the
vacancy left by the promotion of
Steven Jones.

A native of Indiana, Wynn
earned BA. and MA. degrees at
Indiana University, where he
specialized in college-personnel
administration and counseling
psychology. He plans to utilize
both areas in helping student
groups to form and govern lhcmv
selves effectively.

Grinnell’s commitment to
retention and recruitment of
minority students, Wynn said,
wu} his primary reason for
accepting the position of director.
He added that one of the goals of
his office, and of the college in
general, is to see more minority
groups on campus. particularly
Hispanic and Asian students.
Wynn plans to develop strong
programs for them comparable to
what has been done for the
African-American community.
“Grinnell has a lot of studentrrun
programs, like Kotoko [the
governing body of Concerned
Black Students], and I want to
build on some of those
programs." Wynn said. “A
strong possibility is to have an
Asian Civil Rights Sympo-
sium." The symposium is still in
the planning stages, but is
proposed for next year.

to understand what it means to be
a human being, and also to use
the knowledge to instruct others
as to the humanity of our
struggle," he said. While he does
miss South Africa, and hopes to
someday return to the country,
Mathabane has no second
thoughts about his choice to
leave. "lfI had not left South

New Minority Affairs Director
settles into position

Eric Wynn, Grinnell's new director of minority affairs.

Wynn is not planning any
drastic or sudden changes on
campus. Making himself visible
to the campus is his first
priority. “l’m listening and
leaming right now," Wynn said.
“I'm inviting myself to a whole
bunch of group [meetings] . . .
especially special-need groups“
Such as Concemcd Black Studans
and the Grinnell Lesbian and Gay
Alliance. He added. “My mission
is to broaden the scope of the
[Minority Affairs] office. That‘s
important to me,"

As Wynn gradually makes his
presence known on the campus.
he hopes that students will view
him as someone who can identify

Although the white
establishment in South Africa is
responsible for the apartheid
systetn, and reaps the benefits of
it, Malhabttne feels that ill some
ways. South African whites are
also victims of apartheid. "They
are outcasts from the world soci-
ety...they are vilified," he said.

However, he is quick to add that
he thinks the whites have become

with minority issues that come
up on a predominantly white
college campus. When people
see a person of color in a
position such as his, Wynn said,
“They always want to polarize
us" and assume that person will
only help the group of his or her
particular color. He continued. "I
grew up in a predominantly white
neighborhood, and I attended a
predominantly white school. I
know what it‘s like [to be a
minority on such a campus]. i
would hope I could relate in some
way to all minorities, and hope
other minorities would view the
as such. I guess I hope to be
viewed as a resource person."

ignorance and an almost morbid
fear of the unknown. They are a
group of people who prefer not to
know the truth."

When Mathabane was growing
up in the black ghetto of
Alexandra, South Africa, he made
a vow to use all of his strength
to destroy the apartheid system.
Now, many years later, he feels
that he has lived up to his
promise.

"I thlnk I‘ve done all that is
humanly possible, and will
continued to do all that is
humanly possible, to further the
struggle for liberation of South
Africans from the cllains of
apartheid," he said.

Students drive for more
recycling, less waste

by Meridith Levy

A large wooden box in the
post office reads “White paper"
on one side and “Colored paper"
on the other. A sign of
environmental concern among the
students? Many of us would like
to think so.

In fact, it is a sign of apathy.
Recycling that paper died out
about four years ago due to
falling interest in the issue.
“During Reagan's second term,
campus concern about the
environment walled," said
Brandon Lloyd. member of
Grinnell’s Environmental interest
Group, formerly Audubon, “and
with that waning, Audubon‘s
knowledge of where to take the
paper became extinct, and
students lost interest in recycling
it."

Until last Saturday morning,
when about a dozen students met
to discuss recycling paper at an
off-campus house, aptly named
Tree House. The issue, according
to Lloyd. was how the college
could get more reams of paper per
tree through recycling paper and
buying recycled paper.

Anather participant at the
meeting, Jon Kosck, added,
“There is a tremendous waste of
paper on the campus. and student
and administrative apathy toward
the issue of recycling is also
prevalent. We want to get people
interested, and want to make
recycling available to the stu-
dents. The college also needs to
start buying recycled paper to
encourage companies that produce
recycled paper."

The logistics of paper
recycling were also discussed.
“We have to get boxes out on
campus for people to use,"
pointed out Todd Francis, one of
the organizers of the meeting.
On Saturday. Feb. ll, at 9 a.m.,
a meeting will be held at Veggie
House, across froth Quail, to
coordinate the recycling. Francis
urges anyone interested in
helping to come, adding, “We
need lots of boxes, so we can
take one out to every dorm
floor.”

The recycled paper chase isn‘t
just an isolated event on campus.

on “Human Ecology and
Adaptation” was quickly over-
filled, and the 40 students who
preregistered for the class
numbered more than twice the
students who signed up for it last
time it was taught. Andelson
said he is “very optimistic that
concern about environmental
issues is increasing again, after a
period of flagging interest."

Mark Uebel. senior chemistry
major, has his own strategy for
reducing waste. Concerned about
the excess paper and time that go
into junk mail, Uebcl is offering
students a unique opportunity:
get your name off of the source
list for junk mail, “Although ll
won’t get you off of lists that
have already been sold, the
company that sells that list will
take your name off of any future
lists,“ explained Uebel. He added
that “people that ask to be taken
off the list are generally
uninterested in junk-mail
marketing, so the marketers are
gaining from the service, too."
Uebel has posted the sign-up list
in the post office.

Another popular post-office
feature has been notepads made
out of recycled paper. Tahnee
Robertson, one of the notepad
manufacturers, has been delighted
by the success of the project.
”The notepads disappear very fast.
Lots of people have told me'they
think it’s a great idea," she said.
Robertson cites plans for ex,
panding production. through
more presses and more
involvement of the campus. She
also reminds students that all

used, by placing them in the box
