Renovations Send Classes
t0 the Corners of Campus

By Brendan Shepherd

”Mine eyes have seen the glory of
the burning ofthe school..."

At LN. Hanthorn Elementary,
recess for the third graders wasn't
complete without a spirited rendi-
tion of the parody of the “Battle
Hymn of the Republic” celebrating
our school’s destruction. We were
convinced that one night an isolated
natural disaster would level our
school — leaving the kickball dia-
mond and slides intact, of course 7
and free us from classes forever.

Regrettably, a tidal wave neverhit
that pan of Missouri and classes
went on as planned.

Here in Grinnell, classes also go
on as planned. A disaster of sorts —
the renovation of the main class-
room building, ARH —— has sent
Grinnellians to the far reaches of
campus, to the depths of ancient
ruins and to unchartered locales in
search of their ten o‘clock classes.

One unusual classroom location
is the basement of Herrick Chapel,
Senior Bill Warburton describes the
room as a “bit too stale and stuffy."

“The air is stagnant. It smells like
old Bibles," he said.

Besides Herrick, classes are being
held deep inside me Forum. “I have
a class in Forum PDR-B and it is
dark as hell in there!” senior Jim
Caccamo said.“1t‘sjustawful.“

“It makes you feel you’re at a
candlelight dinner instead of class,”
he said,adding that“the room is very
conducive to sleep."

Many classroom locations were
not satisfactory at the beginning of
the semester, as shown by the high
number of room changes. Freshman
Mike Anderson says he‘s glad his
class was moved into the REC.

“At first, our class was in aPDR in
Cowles,“ he said. “We had over 30
people in our class; it must have
been 100 degrees in there."

The ARI-l restoration allows stu-
dents to explore pans of the campus

that were unfamiliar. Senior Layne
Maly has a class in what hecalls the
“bowels” of the science building.
“It‘s in one of those tiny prof‘s of,
fice/storerooms in the basement," he
said. “It‘s wild in there, I get lost
every time I go to class."

And more students are frequent-
ing the REC. this year, with book
bags replacing gym bags Sopho-
more Stephanie Reisdorf says the
classroom environment is not that
unusual, just the location. “It's not
tltat strange to have a class in there,
but I don‘t like it because 1 have to
hurry to my nextclass in Goodnow."

In Herrick Chapel’s
basement, “The air

is stagnant. It smells
like old Bibles.”

The distance also proves to be too
much for one senior who admitted
she‘s frequently late to her morning
class in the REC, because she in-
sists on walking on the less-than-
direct sidewalks instead of crossing
Mac Field. “1 don’t want to get my
shoes wet,“ she said,

However, some students like the
unusual class locations, particularly
those held in Lheirown dorm lounges.
“Sometimes I sleep in until about
livetillren,”juniorCareyPetezsaid.
“1 just go downstairs, grab a Coke
and go to class right there in the
lounge. lprefer it to walking all the
way to ARI-l,”

Another student who is enjoying
the different classroom locations is
junior Steve Moser. Steve lives in
Cowles and has consecutive classes
in the P.E.C.. Cowles Lounge and
Science. “I go back to my room
before every class," he said. “That
way, I only have tocarryonebook at
a time. Also, I get good exercise for
my legs by walking upstairs to my
room so much.“
