I 've Heard The Mermaids Singing

by Kirsten Pogue and Fred Mere
us

The Canadian ﬁlm I' ve Heard
The Mermaids Singing. directed
by Patricia Rozema, won the
Prix de la Jeunesse at Cannes. It
features Sheila McCarthy as
Polly. an amateur photographer
who supports herself by
intermittent secretarial work:
Paule Baillergeon as Gabrielle, a
sophisticated gallery owner; and
Anne Marie MacDonald as Mary
Joseph. an artist who is
Gabrielle‘s lover.

Rozema‘s ﬁlm tells the story
of Polly’s relationship with
Gabrielle and Mary. and traces the
development of Polly’s sense of
integrity. Polly's integrity is
more than self-assurance: she
testiﬁes to the value and impor-
tance of subjective experience,
particularly in the realm of sexu-
ality and art.

Polly ponders the issues of
sexuality and art when she gets a
job as Gabrielle‘s secre-
nary/helper. As an assistant to
the curator. Polly must puzzle
through the artificiality of
Gabrielle‘s chi Chi art world.

Polly also tries to understand
Gabrielle and Mary‘s lesbian
relationship. In one scene, Polly
dreams that she is explaining to
Gabrielle her idea that desire fol~
lows the heart, while gender is
irrelevant.

What raises this ﬁlm above
dull abstraction is Polly‘s simple
and genuine character. To Polly.
art and sexuality are human and
natural. not subject to objective
judgment. And Polly herself
does not get bogged down in
what might be serious subject
matter. The film is humorous
because she takes chances and
makes human mistakes. in one
scene where Gabrielle takes Polly
to a Japanese restaurant, Polly is
intimidated and llustered by the
“savoir faire" of her boss. After
randomly ordering number 13
from the menu, Polly discovers
that it is raw squid.The humor of
situation peaks when Polly tries
to pick up the squid with her
chopsticks

Furthermore. Polly's narra-
tive is unique and powerful in

that she is given control of the
camera. At the outset of the

movie Polly uses a video camera
set up in her apartment. to docu-
ment her own perspective. Even
in scenes where the director takes
control of the camera and narra‘
tive, Polly’s integrity as well as
that of the other characters is left
intact. For instance. in many
scenes the director shoots the
characters with mid»levcl shots
which do not prescribe the
character‘s strength and weak-
nesses. Also. rather than
following characters with the
camera, the director often allows
them to move In and out of the
frame, The simplicity of these
shots gives the viewers the free—
dom to interpret and relate to the
characters without being
manipulated by the director‘s
camela.

The film’s showing Wednes-

Lesbian/Gay

by Matt Macho

Torch Song Trilogy is a
screen adaptation of Harvey Fier-
stein’s smash Broadway hit by
the same title. This story of a
gay New Yorker’s struggle to
live happily in a hostile world is
one which several film compa»
nies wished to produce, but only
after considerable whitewashing.
Fierstein, however, refused to al-
low his work to be compromised,
and thus held out until the pre-
sent version was produced by
New Line Cinema.

While considerably different
from its stage counterpart, Torch
Song Trilogy is a story of pride
and human self—worth that should
not be missed. Originally a set
of reminiscences by Fierstein of
his past love affairs and tribula-
tions. the screen version has been
honed down a bit to a very taut
story. As Arnold, Fierslein sums
off in a wonderful relationship
with Ed (played by Brian Ker-
win). But Ed is a rather confused
bisexual. so after Amold discov-
ers Ed’s “other man" is a woman,
they end the relationship. But
Arnold thcn meets the perfect
love of his life, a model named
Alan (played by Matthew Broder»
ick), and the two decide to live
together permanently (after some
very tricky business between
them and Ed, along with his new
girlfriend) and adopt a child. But
soon after being approved for
adoption, Alan is beaten to death
in the street by a gang of gay-
bashing thugs. This sets up
Arnold‘s major confrontation
with his mother, played by Anne
Bancroft. “Ma" refuses to accept
her son and constantly tries to
change him. Arnold overcomes
adversity and insists on carrying
on With his life as he wishes.

The film is magniﬁcent on

The Color Purple fails

by Dan Capone
ll’s been a long time (at least
it seems far back). but as I re»

- member it. the movie The Color

Purple was a huge disappoint-
ment. 1 hate to sound like your
typical junior-high/gradeeschool
teacher, practically begging stu-
dents to read rather than sit and
stare vacantly before the tele-
vision or the movie screen. but
“the book was better than the
movie.” Honest.

The book had a point to
make, about the dignity of all
people (male AND female), their
ability to grow and to change
with time. However, unlike the
book, the movie, In its assertion
of feminine worth, sees it neces-
sary to attack the worth of men.
Not one man is portrayed in a
positive light (Harpo is a little
bit in the beginning. but by the
end he is a wichabuser and chau-
vinist like all the rest). N0
woman Is portrayed in a negative
light. The book does not observe
such rigid distinctions: several
men are shown positively, not
throughout the book, but they are
shown to be capable of growing
and learning.

There are other problems with
the movie. besides its sexism.
While the book is a product of
black-American culture. written
by Alice Walker, the movie is

largely a sugar-coated product of
white culture. The movie’s
scenery and photographic
composition is too nice. Life for
black Americans at the turn of
the century is portrayed as some-
thing much like Lt'llle [louse on
the Prairie or Living History
Farms touched with a bit of in-
ternal discord. The movie also
ignores the book’s philosophy of
life and religion, which is central
to the points it makes. The book
makes a statement appealing to
the mind and the hean, the movie
infers some of the deeper things
dealt with in the book, but makes
its appeal only to the heart The
book is successful. the movie is
not.

The Color Purple is a poor
adaptation of a book about hu-
manity, and the hope and mean-
ing of life in spite of, and be»
cause of, all the things going on
around us. Directed by Steven
Spielberg, lt stars Whoopi Gold-
berg, Danny Glover. Oprah Win-
frey, and Margaret Avery. Re-
ally, I hate to sound like one of
those old school teachers, but . .
. really, reading is good for you,
and in this case a whole lot better
than the alternative,

Pride Week film in town

malty levels. Perhaps most imr
portantly, It is just about the first
major ﬁlm to treat gay characters
and gay themes in a realistic,
positive way. While the film
does not shy away from the
problems of living gay in a hos-
tile world, it portrays the struggle
of living with dignity in the face
of adversity. There's no question
here that Arnold and Alan share
real love for one another, whether
the rest of the world understands

it or not. Ficrslein is adamant in
making the characters in his work
demand respect.

The superb cast likewise
makes for an excellent produc-
tion. Broderick had his first
breakthrough role in the Broad»
way version of Torch Song. as
the troubled young boy adopted
by Arnold. l-lis transformation to
Alan was a challenge. and one he
carried off with style. And of
course, Fierstein does an excel-
lent job, rcluming to the role that
won him a Tony Award for best
actor. Anne Bancroft puts real
energy into her role as Arnold's

bitchy mother. Bancroft says
she‘s glad the ﬁlm didn’t steer
away from controversy: “The
world is full of people afraid of
what they don‘t understand or
don't know. There is nothing
you can do except try and educate
them. My role epitomizes peo-
ple who want others to become
what they want them to. rather
than what they want and who
they are. I can only hope people
will notice this in themselves.
and learn to love and support and
not to control.”

This is, in short. an excellent
film in general as well as an ideal
film as part of the Lesbian/Gay
Pride Week activities. While
seeing it involves going down-
town to the Grinnell Cinema.
this is well worth it, and after all,
chances are the projectors there
will WORK. I doubt too many
of you have had the opportunity
to see this oneisce it anytime
this week, and see why it will
undoubtedly be a strong contender
for several of next year’s
Academy Awards.

Throw Momma From the Train

Danny DeVito and Billy
Crystal star in this 1987 film,
inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's
Strangers oh i: Truth. In Throw
Mama from the Train, Stu Silr
ver‘s screenplay tells the tale of
two men who each have someone
they want killed. Crystal, a
writer. desires to do away with
his cxrwife who pilfered his
manuscript and turned it into a
best-seller. DeVito wants his
mother dead.

DcVito, who also directed the
film, does a good job of building
sympathy for his character. a nice

guy who tries his best to please
his mom. Only it won’t work,
because she’s the mother from
hell. Anne Ramsey. who died
last year, plays the part of the
cruel mother to perfection.

Crystal is also good as De-
Vito’s writing teacher and con-
spirator, and unless you saw the
previews for the film (which
showed lnany of the funniest
scenes) you are in for an enjoy-
able 88 minutes.
