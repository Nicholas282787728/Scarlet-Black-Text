Pioneers' goal?
Conference, of course

by Bob Lifton

Sometimes you just have to
balance the good and the bad and
start off with a fresh slate. At
least that‘s the plan for Pioneer
baseball coach John Martinck as
his team opens conference play.

The “good” in this case is
Grinnell‘s showing at Ranger
Junior College at Texas over
break. No, they didn’t pull a
David and Goliath and beat the
southern powerhouse, but that
feat wasn't really expected. They
did, however, hold their own
against the big boys, coming
within a run or two in several
games of scoring a major upset.

According to Martinek,
“That’s the best one of my teams
has played down there (Texas).
The pitching, the hitting, the de-
fenseiit was all pretty solid.
They really attacked the ball well.
It was all in all an enjoyable
time.”

The always illustrious “bad"
is represented by last Tuesday‘s
doubleheader loss at Simpson.
last season‘s lowa Conference
championt “Loss“ doesn‘t cx-
actly provtde an accurate descripr
tion of the day‘s events. Not to
go into any detail, "debacle"
comes a little closer. Suffice to
say that the Pioneers lost both
games by the lorrun rule and
have already wiped it from mem-
ory.

Martinck didn’t feel much
like gabbing about the night-
mare, either. “I have no com~
ment," he said. Hey, if you want
the statistics for some morbid
collection or something, you'll
just have to consult the Register.

Sorry.

But that's all over with now.
The Texas trip COnStitutcd Grin-
nell‘s version of spring training,
anti hence plays no part in the
regular season totals. And the
Simpson fiasco was non-confer-
ence, so it too Will be wiped
clean at season‘s end. So when
you come right down to it, the
season unofficially begins this
week.

From here on out, the Pier
neers will only play conference
opponents: thus. every game is
essential. Last season, Mar-
tinek’s squad complilcd a 7-8
conference mark, good for third

place behind first-place Mon-
mouth and Knox.

With the conference playoffs
matching the top two teams from
each division for the first time,
Grinnell has a very good shot at
post-season play. In fact, mak-
ing the playoffs is Martinck‘s
goal for this season. ”I would be
disappointed it We didn't come in
at least in second,” he said.

it the Pioneers execute like

they did down South, that

shouldn‘t be a problem. In addi-
tion to quality pitching, Grinnell
had their share of timely hits,
particularly by freshman Ben
Wallace. All the newcomer did
was hit .500 (S for 10), including
two homers.

Cornell will be Grinnell's
first conference test. The open-
ing game of the doubleheader is
set for 1 pm. this Tuesday. Se-
niors Dave Steinman and Brad
Sheridan are expected to pitch for

‘ the Pioneers.

So take a jaunt on out to the
diamond and help cheer the ‘89
baseball team to a conference ti-
tle—not to be premature or any-
thing.

Netters return in fine form

The men's tennis team,
which posts an early 3,2 mark,
opens a tough home stand this
week. The Pioneers, under the
tutelage of Coach Jeff Westlund,
are coming off an impressive 10-
2, secentiplace finish of a year
ago. Perennial powerhouse
Ripon and a strong Knox team
present formidable obstacles for
Grinnell.

Going into their midrsemcstcr
trip to Colorado, the Pioneers had
racked up a 3.0 record. Fatigue
finally set in, however, as the
nctmcn were forced to play four
matches in three days due to
snow.

After a season~opening 7-2
win over Wartburg, Grinnell dc-
feated Regis 63 and then edged
the University of Denver 5.4.
The squad then bowed to Air
Force Academy JV and Colorado
College, both by 8»1 scores.

According to Wcstlund, “ll
was a good trip and the players
enjoyed it.

if the matches had been
spaced out more, we could have
made stronger showings in the
last two meets. Overall, we did
OK."

Top performers thus far in-
clude senior Ben Lezin, who has
won all ﬁve of his matches in the
numberr4 spot. Three players
sharing the nutnbcr»5 and -6 sloLs
are above the .500 mark. Freshr
man Alan Jeffers is at 3,2 while
sophomore Ara Bulbanian and
freshman Ian Gustafson both
have 2—1 records in singles.

The Pioneers have four
lettcrmen back from the ‘88
team. Veterans include seniors
Lezin, Ed Mincar at number 1
singles, and Rich Pearce at num-
ber 3. Sophomore Bill Campos,

Softball team off to hot start:
Allenburg pitches 2 shutouts

by Laura Whitmorc

Grinnell‘s softball team has
started their season off with three
convincing wins. Returning
early to Grinnell from spring
break for the fourth annual edi—
tion of Camp Gilbert, the Pto-
neers fine-tuned their skills in
preparation for the season ahead._

Their work paid off. On Fri-
day, March 31, Grinnell opened
its season against Clarke College
in Dubuque. Despite the rather
brisk temperature, Grinnell man-
aged to poat a decisive 13-0 win.
But there was little time to cele-
brate as the Pioneers prepared for
a doubleheader against softball
powerhouse Marshalltown
Community College on Monday.

Grinnell overcame both
Marshalltown and their kitty-lit-
tcr inl‘leld to win 3-0 and 11-7.

These wins are the results of
excellent performances by indi~
vidual players. Defensively,
Neva Specht is a key element in
the infield, playing third base.
Seniors Pam Freeso, playing
shortstop, Diana Lewis at second
base, and Ginny Frazer at ﬁrst
