The symposium on “Louis
ultivan and the Architecture of
Democracy." from Thursday.
April 20, to Saturday, April 22,
ill feature authors and architec-
tural historians of national
prominence gathered to discuss
ullivan as both the “father of
modern American Architecture."
d as a cultural philosopher.
Louis Sullivan (1856-1924)
was the leader of the “Chicago
chool" and mentor of Frank
Lloyd Wright. Sullivan designed
variety of buildings ranging
from the Poweshick Bank in
Grinnell to skyscra ers in our
ujor cities in his lifevlong en-
deavor to establish an innovative.
istinetly American style.
Wherever his commission, he
strived to achieve zl union be-
ween functional and artistic as—
poets and an overall harmony of
structure with landscape. Sulli-
van was successful in his
integration of functional, struc-
tuml. and artistic components in
his architecture because of his
broader concern for the relation—
ships between art. technology.
and nature.
, The basis for this philosophy
can be traced to Ralph Waldo
mcrson‘s concepts of transcen-
dentalism. Sullivan applied the
universal law. “form follows
function,“ to his architecture. In
his work, architectural elements
serve as symbols for metaphysi~
Cal truths derived from nature.
ic refinement of purely
functional aspects is required for
architecture to become artr His
work has been labeled as

i‘Democratic," because it was a
new. essentially American style
which provided practical solu-
ions to American social needs.
Most notable of Sullivan‘s
ar-ly works are the steelnframed
skyscrapers. He designed the
Wainwright building in St.

Louis, which is Considered the
first modern skyscraper. His
other famous works includ the
Chicago Audit ’ m Bui ing
(now Roosevelt University) and
the Carson-PirieScoit store.
Tragically, as he sought to pio»
neer a ZOth-century architectural
style distinctive to America, the
prevailing architectural trend to-
wards pseudo-Roman or Greek
stifled his popularity Thus his
activity declined drastically during
the ﬁrst decade of the 20th cen»
tury.

As a result. Sullivan was
forced to take commissions where
he could find them. During this
period of his career (1906-1920),
he was responsible [or designing
eight banks in rural Midwestern
towns. Many architectural
scholars consider these banks his
greatest accomplishments and
contend they are representative of
the breadth of Sullivan's talent.
Grinnell is the Site of one of
these banks. now the Brenton
National Bank. which I will [CB-
urre next week.

As is so often the case with
great innovators, the signiﬁcance
of Sullivan‘s work was largely
neglected during his lifetime. In
1946, over 20 years after his
death, he was awarded the gold
medal of the American Institute
of Architects—the highest award
they can bestow. Indeed, Sulli—
van succeeded in translating a
philosophy of harmony, derived
from nature, to a most-tangible,
exquisite union of form with
function that set an important
precedent for contemporary archi—
tools. The upcoming symposium
on the architecture of Louis Sulr
livan is an excellent opportunity
for Grinnellians to appreciate
more fully the broad impact of
one of America’s greatest archir
teets.
