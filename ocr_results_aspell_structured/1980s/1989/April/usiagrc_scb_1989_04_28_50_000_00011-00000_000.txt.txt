National meet next on Fencers
trackster's agenda

Tomorrow the women‘s and
men's track teams wtll compete
in an NCAA Division-Ill
national invitational at LaCrosse,
Wis.
Last weekend the women’s
squad placed sixth in a nine-
member field at the Central
Invitational. Coach Evelyn
Freeman noted that bad weather
and very talented opposition
Contributed to her club's less
thanrspectucular showing.
Simpson ran away with the meet,
pounding out 168 total points.
To put things in perspective,
Grinneli ended the day With a
modest 12 points,
Freeman was also pleased
wtth her relay teains’
performances. She complimented
Manali Barua, Kate Peterson,
' Abby Green, and Joanne Sackett
. for their effort in tire sprint relay.

as well as Barua, Peterson, Barb
' Duffrin, and Trini Campbell in

The coach plans on taking a
‘ team of eight to tomorrow's
a meet, including top distance
runner Christine Thorbum.
At Central, the men‘s team,
. under the tutelage of Coach Will
Freeman, placed fifth in the nine-
'team field. Freeman was very
. pleased with the team's perfor-
mance, claiming that things seem
‘to be Coming together. He also
. pointed out that no Grinnell athr

Ictes doubled up on events, which
naturally would have given the

team more total points.

Grinnell racked up a good
portion of their 64.5 total in the
5000-meter, as Jonathan Lave
finished first, David Hammond
second, and Greg Evans fouth.

Distance events are clearly the
Pioneer's strong suit, as they
scored in three other races. Dave
Peterson placed second in the
30007meter Steeplechase, and
Todd Rowekamp ran fifth in the
15007meter. Meanwhile, Jeff
Nassif and Geoff Hoops finished
fifth and six in the 10,0mrmeter.

In the field the Pioneers also
fared well. Lee Kracmcr was
second in the pole vault, and

John Lopes came in fourth in the
discus.

There has been a desire ex»
pressed by some people both on
and off the team to try to reach a
compromise which is acceptable
to both parties before the matter
is dropped entirely. If anyone has
any suggestions, they would be
very welcome.

widows and widowers. The four
such bureaus in Beijing in 1987
served over 3000 registered
members.

Unfortunately, women do not
always fare so well as their male
counterparts.

At first glance the elderly
marriage bureaus seem to be
breaking new ground in securing
rights for widows, for whom re»
marriage was considered abso-
lutely scandalous throughout
Chinese history, However, when
one looks more closely at the
clientele of the bureaus, an
alarming proportion of the older

men seem to be more interested
in finding a maid than a company
ton,

An article about the bureaus
in Beijing Review magazine
noted, “Old women are useful
around the house. Old men are a
burden, so [a man] is more likely
to look for a wife to take care of
him."

Furthermore, the more edu-

ated a woman, the more difficult
it may be for her to find a mate.
When personals first began apr
pearlng in China a few years ago,
Western media were quick to note
that women with advanced de-
grees made up a surprising
majority or the ad plaecrs.

The singles scene in China is
developing rapidly. How long
before women will be able to
participate as men’s equals, or at
least more equally than they do
now, is uncertain.
