 

Student criticizes
"sexist" language

To the editor:

Just before break, I received a
notice in my mailbox for the
upcoming campus blood drive,
which encouraged all men to give
the gift of life. I was puzzled to
find this message addressed to
me, since I am a woman. More
than puzzled, I was deeply ot-
fended that women are apparently
being disregarded as potential
donors. I have given blood in the
past and fully agree that such do-
nations are necessary, but I
strongly object to the sexist con-

tent of the message. There are
those who still argue that “man"
is a generic term for
“humankind." It is not. Neither
does the term “brother" include
all people, Language has an in-
credible influence on our culture.
who we are, and what we think.
Let's try to make what we say
Lruly reﬂect what we mean. Un-
less, of course, you really don’t
want half of the campus to
participate in the blood drive.

For Non-Gay People During
Lesbian/Gay Pride Week

Ahhhh, our week is finally here.
A lot of people have worked very
hard, and we are proud to say that
ncxt week‘s extravagan'la is one of
the largest of its kind produced by
acampus community. But the pur-
pose of this article is not to patour—
selves on the back. Rather, it‘s to
say that this campus is quite lucky
to have us aroundimeuning next
week is an educational opportunity
like few others Grinr

out the week, these are the few in
which you can directly participate.
Additionally, there are many ways
in which you can show your 3017
idarity with lesbian/gay pride on
your own time.

About 40 nonrgay people will
be participating in two different
“unlcaming homophobia” work-
shops on Sunday, April 9. (The

heights? Yes,well,we haveshown
up in this here 5 mid B to answer
these questions...

Firstly. it's obvious Lhal. simply
by attending the week’s lectures,
workshops,seminars,dances,con-
certs,and films you are botli learn-
ing about lesbian/gay people and
heightening your awareness ofour
struggle. Buttllcrearenianythings
you can do which go beyond just
attendance; you can participate as
well. On Monday, at 10 am, we
will begin our day of silence in
solidarity witli the lesbian/gay Sl-
lcnced majority ofthe past, present
and future. The entire campus
community is invited to share this
experience with us, Ihercbycxpress

dltyofsilencc,wcwill bcpresenting
our testimonies in a “silent mcclr
ing”in NorthLounge,Tuesdayat8
p.m. These testimonies will be

community about our personal
struggles,ourpain,andourvisions.
On Thursday at 8 pm. in Arena

to attend and to participate in a

people and themes. Bring your

sonation. Anything goes. Though
there are many other events which
you are invited to attend through-

ingToddBrownatPD.
Box 2-83, or tell
BROWNT.) These allies will be
present throughout the week and
will help you show your support
for lesbian/gay people and (in part)
experience their oppression through
certain actions. Consider the fol-
lowing:
1. Wear a pink triangle.
2. Go in drag one day (do some»
thing “inappropriatc”foryourgen-
der).
3. Ask your friends if they are
eraigllt, and be surprised if they
answeraffirliiatively. ityou arc in
the mood, ostracize them llnd ask
them questions from the “hetero-
sexual qu tionn 're."
4. Express no affection to members
of the opposite sex.
5. If someone you are with ex
presses an affectional/sexual inr
tcrextinsomebody,assumethattlie
person is of their sex.
6. Be repulsed/dlsgusttxl/shocked
if someone mentions their hot-

erosexual lover or love interest.

7. Walk across campus holding
hands with your best friend of your
gender.

8. Tell your roommate and/or par-
entsthat you are lesbian/gay and see
how they react. Don‘t deny it later.
9. Ask your friends to wear pink tri-
angles and toattendourcvents, Tell
them why. Feel very rightand con-
ﬁdent.

to. Don't let the fear of someone
thinking that you are lesbian/gay
keep you from challenging yourself
and becoming more aware. This
fear is homophobia at its worst.

These are just a few basic ways
in which youczin do yourselfa favor
during Pride Week. By taking part
in oneof these actions, you can con
front your own homophobia and be
gin to understand how it hurts and
conﬁnes all of us.

As Lesbian/Gay Pride Week is
finally here, we have high expect. -
tion of our beloved community.
Every person is invited to each of
the week‘sevenlsiincludlng those
people way up in the Griniiell hi—
Cmrcliy. Come and challenge your-
self. and help our work come to II
meaningful pass. We will be dlcrc
in the middle of it all (your house»
mates,roolnmates,co-workers,ttnd
classmates); we will be watching
from dicouLskirlS,and1islening from
just inside ourclosct doors. And we
hope you will be there. too.

American Nazi Party, and of

groups like Operation Rescue is
completely invalid.

Mr, Macho seems very inter
ested in arguing against the
warpcd view of the pro-life
movement that exists in his
mind, but doesn‘t appear to show
much interest in debating the
legitimate pro-life position.
Why is it that every single one of
his attacks is based on somouimg
other than the pro-life ideology?
He has attacked “hypocrisy,” he
has attacked the actions of fringe
groups, he has set up ridiculous
positions (i.e. the birthcontrol
opposition argument) and then
proceeded to tear them down. All
of these things are dependent on a
pro-lifer having sortie other belief

position that way. Mr. Macho,
if you waiit to attack my posi
tion, first present your own and
support il, then go ahead and atA
tack my arguments. Don't attack
the actions- of some demonstra-
tors in Atlanta, don’t attack a
position on some other issue
(birth control, child-care spend-
mg). don‘t tell me how I think (i
want to control women‘s bodies),
address lily arguments. You
don't know tny position on any
other issue, you don’t know how
i think, and I didn'tptirliciptite ln
the Atlanta demonstrations.

lf you want to argue pron
choice, wlty don‘t you first sup»
port the pro-choice lrlcology. To
launch an attack without first
stating your position means that
our ”discussion" will be you at-
tacking lny arguments anti the
defending them. That’s not a de
bate, Mr. Macho.

In the future, if you wish to
attempt a logical argument
through your opinion column,
perhaps you would be wise to re-
frain from basing your entire po-
sition on straw men, ad homincm
both by character assassination
and guilt by association, un-
provable speculations, and
hypothetical situations. Until
you do so, your arguments aren't
worth the time it takes to tell
you they are invalid. Michael
