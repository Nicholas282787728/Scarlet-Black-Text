munity differences Interested
students can pick up additional
information and applications in
the Community Service Center
office on Mears Third.

Another program for students
interested in joining the Peace
Corps after graduation is cur»

rently being planned through the
Off-Campus Studies office. The

, Peace Corps/0C5 program would

include specific courses, semi»
nars, and independent studies
completed on the Grinnell Came
pus as well as internships and
some type of crossrcultural exper
riencc, The internships may take
place in the United States, work-
ing in suclt areas as agriculture
and construction, or they may be
overseas working in Peace Corps
administrative offices. It is
hoped that participating students
will be accepted into tltc Peace
Corps late in their sophomore or
junior years, As part of the pro-
gram, Grinnell is hoping to bring
in speakers who have experience
with the Peace Corps.

The Peace Corps/0C5 pro
gram is still in the planning
stages and is consulting Grinnell
faculty and alumni who have
been in the Peace Corps as to
what should be included in the
program. Most of the Peace
Corps volunteers are liberalrarts
graduates and this program is de-
signed to give them skills and
experiences that will be valuable
in work environments. Further
information on the Peace
Corps/0C5 program should be
released next year. The projected
date for the first internships is the
summer of 1990.

would take away the right of the
individual. “Legislation should
not deprive women of the right to
make that very private decision
themselves,” said Crystal.

“If you take away the right of
free choice, you're taking away
the right of self-defense of half of
the population (women). And if
you make abortion illegal, there‘s
going to be a great upsurge of
crime because people are going to
have them anyway," said a Uni
versity of Iowa employee.

Most demonstrators did not
discuss the morality of abortion;
they said mey believed the moral
issue involved frtxxlom of choice.

abortion to be prorchoice. The
point is that a woman has control
over her own body,” said Grinnell
studentErika Spiegcl.
Testimonies from women

who have had abortions as well
as those who chose to have the
baby pointed out the idea that
freedom of choice does not limit
itself to the option of abortion.

“It was interesting to hear the
testimonies by the women who
had chosen to have the baby—
even those who didn‘t have aborr
lions could be pro-choice. They
made the choice to have the baby,
but at least the choice was
theirs,“ said Jon Wentzel, another
student at Grinnell.

Infomtal Discussion

THURSDAY, APRIL 27, 1989

All are welcome.

Approximately 20 to 30 pro-
lifers were present. carrying
posters with pictures of fetuses
through the crowd as pro-choice
demonstrators tried to block their
path. “I'm speaking for the
unborn child who doesn‘t have a
voice. . .These people don't want
to see this picture: they’re
covering it up," said a West Des
Moinw prorltfe advocate.

Those who blocked the pro-
life demonstrators believed that
they were not infringing upon the
right to freedom of expression.
“They (the pro»lifcrs) are
expressing their views by being
here. We’re expressing our views
by covering up their signs." said
a Des Moines demonstrator.

One Grinnell student, locy
chdcn, was involved in sur-
rounding the counter-protesters.
“Attempting to block the pro-life
ers was a powerful feeling among
all the women there,” she said.

According to Senator Elaine
Szymoniak, the anti-abortionists
created a false emotionalism.
“The most important issue is the
woman's right to her own body.
These people are only concerned
with birth, not the women and
children, those in poverty Those
people who work hard for child
care, education, health, and em-
ployment are the ones who have
a right to speak," she said,

Anti-abortionist Pat Wadlc
commented on abortions result
ing from rape and incest, “The
statistics of the pregnancies re»
sulting from rape are so low
they‘re not even worthy of con-
versation. . .But a rape victim
won‘t feel any better after taking
the life of the baby. The baby
isn't to blame for what happened,
and neither is she. . .There are
two victims of an abortion, and
the end result is Still a dead
baby," said Wadle.

Most proAlifers stood on the
steps of the Capitol, awaiting the
speech of Mary Jean Collins.
“I‘m representing the real Roman
Catholics. That speaker is not,“
Wadle said, referring to Collins.

Wentzel addressed the pro-life
Catholics’ accusations against
Collins. “I think a lot of people
hide behind the church for their
views on pro-life," he Shirl.

Collins refutcd the pro-life
Catholics’ accusations. “Whether
I’m a real Roman Catholic is not
their decision to make. I stood
up as a Catholic and as an
advocate of prorchoiee. . .In light
of the argument over when life
begins, the Catholic Cllllrch has
never determined when the soul
enters the body."

For Spicgel, the rally served
to raise awareness. She noted,
“There were a lot of older wolnen
there, wolnen who lived during
the time when abortions were ilr
legal.“ She added, “I don't think
people re ze how tnuch of an
issue it is. The rally made the
more aware that students are re-
ally far-removed from the issues.
and hearing the speakers and sec-
ing the emotion of the people
brings you closer."
