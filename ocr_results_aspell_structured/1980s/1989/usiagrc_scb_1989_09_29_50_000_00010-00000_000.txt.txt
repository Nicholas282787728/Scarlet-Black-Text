Right to Abortion

Initiative introduced by the Politically Active Feminist Alli-
ance.

right to choose and obtain a safe and legal abortion
Therefore we oppose any attempt, whether legislative or
judicial, to limit or restrict this right.

Animal Flights
Initiative introduced by the Grinnell Animal Rights Coalition.
Whereas yellow-fin tuna are caught using netting methods
which are destructive ofmarine life, and particularly ofdol»
phins: and whereas albacore tuna is increasingly being
caught using these same methods; and whereas the packag-
ing of tuna-ﬁsh products does not specify the method by
which the tuna was obtained; we, the students of Grinnell
College who participate in the dining—hall meal plan, ask
that tuna ﬁsh and tuna recipes offered in the dining halls be
clearly labeled as boycotted items so that:
. Students and visitors in the dining halls willbecome more
aware of the issue of net-caught tuna; and
. Students and visitors in the dining halls may chooseto make
a personal decision not to eat tuna products, in order to put
economic pressure on the tuna industry to abolish the use of
these methods, '
