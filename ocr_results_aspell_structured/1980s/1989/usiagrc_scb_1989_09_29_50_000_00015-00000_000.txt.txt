Volleyers: Room for Improvement

By Julie Kaster

The Grinnell women‘s volleyball
team is discovering the weakness-
nesses they must overcome.

Last Saturday‘s lackluster per-
formance against Luther College
could be attributed to the absence of
coach Sheila Cain, but it deﬁnitely
demonstrated the need for more
mental preparation and teamwork.
Scores of 13715, 5-l5, and 3~15 il-
lustrated the decline in concentra»
tion which resulted in missed serves
and hesitation.

Grinnell'slackof consistency and
aggression played a large part in its
loss to conference rival Coe on
Tuesday. When the serves werebeing
put in play, the team was able to
operate its offense, but those oppor-
tunities were few, anda furthcrbreak-
down in defense ended the game at
6-15,

Kathy Kntz executed a perfect
one set, short and low to the net, to
middle hitter Susan Egbert, who
spiked it for the kill, making the

’ score 10-14. Unfortunately, Grin»
nell failed to take advantage of the
serve and lost 11-15.

As in the second game, the unit

experienced a loss of timing and

. seemed a step late to each ball. The
return of injured starter Sandy Tibr
betts provided a momentary spark
for the team, but the recurrence of
psychological serving difficulties
resulted in a 7-15 loss.

”Mentally wearenot going after a
victory the way we should be. or
even coming out ready to play and
be aggressive," said Coach Cain.

After the match against Coe, the
team took to the court opposite

game one. 13-15, as Grandview
capitalized on Grinnell‘s poor hitter
coverage. However, Grinnell was
not overpowered by Grandview’s
height advantage, as the front-row
players were able to block several
potential kills.

The use of fewer substitutions in
game two allowed Grinnell to win
its only game of the evening. The
unit on the court was able to estab
lish somecontinuity,andtherhythm
they created was to the tune of a 15.
ll win. Setter Amy Robinson was
moved,andshe usedan off-speed hit
which caused timing difficulties for
the Grandview defense.

“I think the players are able to
concenttate more on the game when
we have fewer breaks for substitu-
tions. Playing all the way around
appears to help a player mentally,"
Coach Cain said.

The last game of the match was a
fmstrating one, as Grinnell could
not direct its digs, thus putting the
ball in the perfect position for the
Grandview hitters. Although the

Three weeks into the season, the
men‘s soccer record is 32-1.
Although they struggled underthe
burden of a three-game home stand
the weekend of Sept. 15. Grinnell
easily destroyed Monmouth, its first
conference opponent, last Tuesday.
The following is a recap of the past
two weeks, culminating in the Pio-
neer’s recent 30 win at Monmouth.
Grinnell drew Carleton first. Al-
though the Pioneers could not muse
ter up a score in the ﬁrst half, Matt
Schrager, Ian Lorimer and Tom
McCullen gave the visitors fits with
their near misses. In the second half,
Grinnell drowned Carleton in a bar»
rage of shots, three of which scored.
McCullen headed in a throwrin
from Peter Greif, Steve Fairchild
scored with a ground cross-in from
the right wing. and Grief put in a
loose ball in front of the goal. The
Pioneers emerged victorious 3-0.
Saturday morning they took to a
very slippery Mac Field to face St.
Olaf. The Pioneers seemed confused,
frequently bunching up and sending
misdirected passes skidding across
“Mac Rink.” The opponents took

. advantage of this. scoring two quick

goals in the first half and barer
missing a third with five seconds
left.

In the second half, the Pioneers
took control early, playing as they
had the day before and finally get-
ting off some shots. They were un-
able to capitalize though and the

game ended with St. Olaf as the
winner. 20.

Day three, Sunday, Sept. 17, saw
Grinnell pitted against Trinity Uni-
versity. Though as Allen Joseph
admitted, “three in a row certainly
did take its effect,” the Pioneers
scored first off a Greif lhl’onln in
the second half,

Good defense by Mark St. Andre
and John Stillman held off many
Trinity attacks, but with 14 minutes
left the visitors managed to get one
by keeper Dave Shane to knot the
score at l-lt The remaining minutes
of the game and two ovenimes saw
the teams battle to a draw.

game, and Schrager followed with
his eight minutes later.

The remainder of the game saw
Grinnell outshoot Monmouth 20.5
with Joseph‘s second goal coming
midway through the second half.
Coach Pfitsch said he was pleased
with how much the team has im-
proved in the past weeks.

“If wecontinuetoimproveasmuch

The Pioneer's next game is this
