Apartheid, Set to New Music

South African President F.W. de
Klerk has been springing some sur-
prises lately.

He has released Walter Sisulu, a
prominentpoliticalprisonerwhowas
sentenced to life imprisonment with
Mandela in 1962. He has also an»
nounced his willingness to negotiate
with all organizations that aim for
“peaceful change" in South Africa.
including the banned African Na-
tional Congress. He has relaxed the
emergency laws and permitted tale
lies to be held,

His negotiation proposals sound
attractive and luring. No precondie
tions for talks, no backing of de»
mands with threats of violence and
formulating a process to choose the
black negotiators.

Ptrblic response has been varied.
Antirapanheid activistsare hopeful,

but cautious because the South Afri-
can govemmentis notorious when it
comes to honoring its word and sly
when it comes to pacifyin g or divid-
ing its opposition.

Instead of agreeing to abolish
apartheid, the government encour-
ages the idea that gradual “reforms"

will solve the problem.

th. Botha was particularly good
at this. He managed to divide the
coloreds and Indians by allowing
them some representation in gov-
ernment,

The schism split those who saw
representation as a tactical survival
maneuver and and those who saw it
as a foundation for changing the
system from within.

African countries are also cau-
tious.TheyhaveendorsedtheANC‘s
platform, the basic demandof which
is “one person, one vote," and most
still feel that the pressure on South
Africa should be maintained

But nations friendlier to South
Africa tend to ﬁnd a reason to trust
her wholeheartedly.

The most notorious example is
Britain’s Margaret Thatcher, who
defended South Africa from sanc-
tions of any kind at the recent Kuala
LumpurCommonwealthconference.
Thatcher excitedly expressed her
belief that the South African leaders
were genuinely bent on humanitarr
ian refomt.

Caution is appropriate — and
essential, De Klerk may be surpris-
ing us, buthisbiggestsurprisemight
not be his best»loved. I-lis basic de~
mand in any negotiations ls constitu—
tionally guaranteed protection for
whites 7“group rights” for “at leasr
20 years”7to guarantee that whites
have enough power to ensure their
own “protection.“

KDIC to Go Back On Air

KDIC will ﬁre up its transmitter
and begin broadcasting againinabout
a week, said Steven Jones, associate
dean of student affairs and advisor to
the campus radio station,

Jones said KDIC will “be on the
air by a week from Monday,“ pro-
viding everything goes as planned.

The station’s transmitter was sent
back to the manufacturer for repairs
after people complained in early
October that KDIC was interfering
with other stations’ broadcasts.

Jones did not know the exactprob-
lem with the five-year old transmit-
ter but said that “problems come up
from time to time.” He estimated the
cost of repair between $1,500 and
$2,000.

College president George Drake
saidtheshipping and insurancecosts
alone ran over $1,000. Drake said
the expenses will be covered by the
college‘s renovations and repairs
budget

While some people did threaten to
complain to the FCC about KDIC’s
over-modulating A not holding to
its assigned frequency * Jones said
he didn‘t know if anyone actually
did so.

Complaints to the FCC, the Fed

eral Communications Commission,
would be especially unwelcome at
this time because KDIC’s license is
up for renewal.

"Atthis point we seem tobeokay,”
he said, “There isn’t any backlash
from the FCC. They can see we are
actively seeking to correct the prob-
lem.“ Jones said.

“I‘ll be relieved when we’re back
on the air,” he said.

Chemistry Show

To celebrate National Chemistry
Week, Grinnell’s chemistry depart»
ment is hosting an open house and
Mr. Wizard-style “magic show" for
area high school students and mem-
bers of the college community to-
day, Friday, Nov. 3, at 1:30 pm.

Gene Wubbels, Dack Professor of
Chemistry, will give two colorful
lecture demonstrations at2 pm. and
at 3:30 pm. in Science 2001,

Wubbels will demonstrate and
explainavariety of chemical“magic
tricks," including how to make dry
ice change color using common let-

tuce, and how to make a crate full of '

stymfoam ﬁt into a small beaker,

 

Which is a sweet way of saying
that whites will still be very inﬂuen-
tial for another 20 years, In practice,
deKlerk’s plan could result in white
domination. The capacity to protect
could easily become the capacity to
dominate. In fact, that could be the
motive for de Klerk's new policy:
apartheid with a new, more accept-
able music,

And after “20 years”? Well, who
says they must change then? “At
least 20 years” could be interpreted
to mean 50. 70 or 100 years.

If you think that is too big a lie to
getaway with, remember that South
Africa has gotten away with bigger
lies before,

TheSouLh African governmenthas
the power to impose any settlement
that pleas“ itself, and this time not
by shooting it through in townships,
but with the unintentional conniv—
ance of the blacks themselves under
the guise of negotiations and with
the sick rationality of being practical
and accommodating to the demands
of all races — but especially the
white race.

Only time can reveal de Klerk‘s
true intentions. But there is no time
to talk about time, The abolition of
apartheid must be immediate, not
delayed.

If de Klerk won't do it immedi-
ately, by demanding “group rights"
and imposing suchasettlement, then
we are nowhere, and are only facing
apartheid set to new music.
