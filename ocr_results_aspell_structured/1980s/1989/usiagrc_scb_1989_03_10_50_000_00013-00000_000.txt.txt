Birdy an extremely striking
examination of wounds of war

by Brian Strausc
Birdy (Matthew Modinc) is
one of the wildest characters ever
captured on film. He is not just
into birds, he wants to be a bird.
While this idea may be a passing
fancy for some, it is an obsession
for Birdyian obsession that in-
terestingly makes him all the
more human. or perhaps humane.
Clearly the kind of guy who
turns his room into a bird cage
should not be sent off to ﬁght in
the Viemam Wart Yet fight he
does. And like so many of the
retuming soldiers from Vietnam,
Birdy’s scars are psychological.
Instead of physically ﬂying away,
Birdy ﬂies away in his mind, cf-
fcctively making the transition
from bird admirer to bird marl.
Birdy is not a war film. yet at
times it focuses on the woundsi
one mental and one physical—
suffered by two friends at the
hands of the Vietrtam War. The
film does not dwell on the war
experience, but on the events
leading up to combat and the
struggle by Birdy's childhood
buddy, A1 (Nicolas Cage), to
bring his friend back into reality.
The film begins with Al’s visit
to the Sanitarium in which Birdy

As the title might suggest. this
film is more than just a docu-

Central America. The ﬁlm takes

SCARLET AND BLACK

Gaslight great
suspense

by Matt Macho

Gurlighl is a great suspense
thriller of 1944, Or 1940, de»
pending on how you look at it.
The first version (from a British
play) was made in 1940 but has
all but disappeared, since MGM
bought the rights to it and re-
called all the copies of it in order
to make way for its own version
starring Charles Boyer and Ingrid
Bergman.

The plot revolves around an
old Victorian house. A wealthy
woman is killed there by a jewel
thief. but neither the jewels nor
the thief were ever found. The
woman‘s gentle niece (Bergman)
and her husband (Boyer) move in,
and strange stuff starts to happen.

Bergman’s character starts
heating strange noises and having
hallucinations It turns out that
her creepy husband is staging ev-
erything in order to make her go
insane. The film‘s title became a
great metaphor for any "big-lie”
trickery meant to deceive an un-
witting person.

Although some film snobs
insist that the l940 version was
superior. this is hard to believe.
since Bergman does a superb job
depicting a fragile woman trying
to keep a grip on her feeble san-
ity, and won an Academy Award
for her performance. The film
also has great sets, and an
appearance by Angela Lansbury
in her first screen role.
Bergman's twisted rant at the
ﬁlm’s conclusion, in which she
makes her final grasp for sanity,
is also not to be missed

Dim Sum: A little bit of heart

by Nara Takakawa

Hollywood has been one of
the main culprits in perpetuating
stereotypes of Asians. Men are
portrayed as geeky, buck-toothed
immigrants who wear plastic
pocket pen holders or as Bruce
Lee»ty'pe martial—arts gods. The
stereotypes of women are espe-
cially degrading, since they are
often portrayed as exotic mis-
tresses. (Why must the model
for the silky leggs pantyhose ad
be Asian?) That Dim Sum breaks
these stereotypes is precisely why
it is such a delight. Finally, a
film that portrays Asians as
multi—faceted human beings.

Director Wayne Wang ex-
plains, “I was filming in a Chi—
nese home and saw all the shoes
on the floor by the doori This

image gave me the idea of mak»
ing a movie about the people
who belonged to those shoes . . .
how their family lives and out-
side lives fit together." The story
centers around Geraldine Tam, a
Chinese-American woman who
still lives with her widowed
mother. She feels trapped by the
obligation to be “a good Chinese
daughter“ who cares for her aging
motheri After a brief illness.
Mrs. Tam (Geraldine’s mother)
decides to visit China “to pay her
last rcspccm” and rcturns to the
States unexpectedly revitalized.
She offers a solution to the
dilemma, using ”a little bit of
heart", the literal translation of
“dim sum“.

Road Warrior: "action film to end

all action films"

by Matt Macho

This is it, folks, the action
film to end all action ﬁlms. Just
about all the other flicks with a
lone wan‘ior stuck in a hellish
postrapocalyptic world don’t even
begin to come close to Road
Warrior. Even the two other
films in the trilogy, Mad Max
and Beyond the Thunderdome, are
lame in comparison. The latter
even got a PG rating. Not this
one.

Mel Gibson. the Road War-
rior, is an ex-cop out on his own
in a world of savage gangs who
hunt and kill for fuel. He comes
across an oasis of oil and water
guarded by a group of “good
guys." He agrees to help them
escape the punk gangs ruled by
the Lord Humongous (“The Aya-

tollah of Rock and Rollah“) who
are laying scige to the place for
the fuelt

Gibson goes head to head
with the Lord Humongous’ right-
hand man, a crazed biker with a
mohawk and an attitude so nasty
Humongous keeps him on a
leash The two have their final
battle in a really spectacular chase
scene that may be the best you
ever see out of Hollywood.

This is one‘ sure to please
even the most gluttonous addicts
of mass mayhem, and with a
style not to be found in junk like
Ramboi Yeah, yeah, it‘s been
here before, but who cares?
Welcome to the jungle.
