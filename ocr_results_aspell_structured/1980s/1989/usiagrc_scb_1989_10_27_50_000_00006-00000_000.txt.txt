‘ Townic ,

’ Epithct

of Higher Learning

By Mark Baumann

“Nigger." “Faggot." These are
ugly words a person of consequence
does not say in today’s society.
Unless you are Axl Rose and you get
paid to say such things, and even
then you don’t say them in mixed
company, likearound human beings.

And at Grinnell, you have to be
careful whom you call “girl.” Fe-
males at Grinnell are not girls, they
are women. And sometimes they're
not even women. they’re womyn or
wimmin and such.

Perhaps the most lasting memory
I will have of my freshman swima
ming season, aside from almost
breaking my hand on another
swimmer’s skull, concerned this
issue. Toweling off in the locker
room,Iasked how the girls’ team did
that weekend. No sooner had the
word left my mouth than two ShowA
ering voices hollered, ”WOMEN'S
team." When a naked man yells at
you, you cart be sure he is saying
something important And this was.

But there is one epithet you will
hear timeand timeagain at thisinsti-
Lure of higher learning, and it’s not
“doctor." It’s “townie."

This is not a pretty word. Simply,
it is offensive not only in its conno-
tation,but in the way ithas soperme-
ated the jargon of this campus that
one can hear the word said so many
times in a given class that the profes-
sor herself begins to say it, and itrtill
doesn’t offend anyone.

Some may fool themselves in
saying the word is hardly derogatory
at all, that it is simply a convenient
way to denote “someoneiromrthc-
townrofr Grinnell-who-isn’t—associr
ated-wilh>lhercollege-unless-he-or-
she-ts-B-an.” This may be true, but
it is also true the word is preface/d
with a “fuckin‘ " or “goddamn" more
often than not. “Townies” are sim-
ply not held in high esteem, not

because they have some deﬁciency
of character, but because they do not
go to this college. I mean, they don’t
pay to go here.

Others may try to define the word
a bit more stringently, using it to
refer to the throbbin’ pack of
hormones who prey on drunk col-
lege kids 7 oops, I mean. drunk
college women and men. This does
serve to specify the group as socially
repugnant, but if such methods of
definition worked, the aforemen-
tioned Axl-man wouldn‘t offend
anybody when he tells so-called
“niggers”togetouttahislong-haired,
tattooed way. After all, he deﬁnes a
“nigger” as “somebody that is basi-
cally a pain in your life, a problem ,"
andthis cenainly describes no one at
this college. black or white. And he
said all this in Rolling Stone, so you
know it's true

But Mr. Rose attd his band do
offend people, because while their
collective heart may be in the right
place, their tongues certainly aren’t
You can‘t use a word like that, a
word which lumps groups of people
together for one superficial. arbi-
trarytrait,likeskin color.Orplaceof
residence. This is stereotyping, and
the only places stereotypes ring true
are on TV and in magazines like
Rolling Stone.

‘Townies” is a word which can
claim the same cultural heritage as
“gook” and “bitch" and “spic” and
umpteen others which foster a “wc»
they”feelingThes/earetheproducts
of bigotry, nothing else.

So don’tcall these bullies “town-
ies." Call them something you’ve
called at least one of your room-
mates at least once, not [0 mention
members ofyour immediate family.
Call them “assholes."

And call everyone else from Grin-
nell-proper Mrs. or Ms, or Mr. or
whatever they want to be called. Call
them ma’am and sir.

Freedom of Speech Isn’t for Everyone

 

To the Editor:

I think I am ﬁnally starting to see
what Grinnell liberalism is all about.

Every person enjoys freedom of
speech,aslongastheGrinnellstatus
quo likes what you say.

Every person has freedom to their
own beliefs, but that doesn‘t stop us
from having initiatives stating the
“official" views of the campus on
controversial issues. I wonder if this
campus would react the same if we
were voting on an “official" reli-
gion: “We the students of Grinnell

College believe that Christ is true
Lord and we oppose any attempt by
anyindividualtodiscredithisname.”
(I guess abortion is different since
it‘s obvious people don’t have as
strong views on that subject.) How
ironic thatthe “prochoicers”, whose
primary argument has been “don’t
legislate morality,” tum around and
attempt to do exactly that. So much
for ideological consistency.

The status quo maintains the right
to make fun of the views of any
person oumide the Grinnell norm,

 

Grinnell Seeks Minority Faculty,
Tortured or Not, Across the Board

 

To the Editor.

Kim Eckart’s reporting of my
views on afﬁrmative action (“Mi-
nority Faculty Scarce Nationwide,"
Oct. 6) were completely accumte
except for one statement that was
attributed to me.

Ms. Eckart wrote: “On the imme-
diate level, there is an emphasis on
the hiring process — on continuing
to seek out tenured minority faculty
rather than recent graduatm."

What I actually said, in response
toaquestion,wasthatyes,we would
ﬁnd itdesirable to hire senior minor-
ity faculty. But I assuredly did not
say, or mean to imply, that we are

interested only in senior minority
faculty to the exclusion of recent
graduates.

In fact, [pointed outto Ms. Eckart
that one of the resources we use in

universities’ annual listing of all
minorities who have taken, or are
close to taking, PhD. degrees at
those institutions These would all
be recent graduates, and we actively
invite them to apply for faculty open»
ings.

Protect FreedomWith Ballots, Not Bullei

 

To the Editor:

In defense of my “self»righteous-
ness and willful narrowimindedncss"
on the issue ofgun control, ascribed
to me by R. Keith Rugg in a letter
(Oct. 6): the right of ihe people to
keep and bear arms does rial refer to
the right of each individual to keep
and bar arms, at least according to
all interpretations of this clause by
the Supreme Court. the final arbiter
of constitutional questions.

Although theNRAsays thatitwas
the intent of the Constitution’s fra-
mers that each citizen should have
the right to bear arms, this position
has been refuted repeatedly by the
SupremeCourtbecauseitis notwar—
ranted by the document‘s language.

The word “people" is used in the
Second Amendment to refer to a
collective body i the people should
be armed in order to function as a
militia. State laws restricting gun
ownership have been on the books
for years, and have been upheld as
constitutional. Had the framers cone
curred with the current NRA posi»
tion they would have phrased the
Second Amendment differently: “the
right to keep and bear arms will not
be abridged.”

They did not frame the amend-
ment mis way, and they were ex-
tremely careful about the language
used in the Constitution.

Mr.Rugg’s contention that the
framers of the Constitution envi-
sioned a two-th militia, and that

they wrotethe secondamendmentin
order to insure the right of every
American to bear arms, has come
beforctheSuprcmcCourtfive times,
and has been consistently rejected.

The last point of debate — that
with the presence ofa standing army
the right to bear arms becomes more
crucial — seems at first to be self
evident. Yet, at our level of techno!
logical development, the refinements
in military communications and
hardware have made civilian repul-
sion of the national military force
rather unlikely.

A police state will not be diverted
merely by maintaining private arse-
nals; only through vigorous checks

of intrusive government power
we maintain our liberties. The
not as glamorous as wielding r}.
at your hip, political participa
will ultimately determine wh‘et
or not our rights are protected.«
As for Mr.Rugg’s comment:

I Want My Clothes Back... And 1
While You’re at It, Some Respect‘

 

To the Editor:

Theft of laundry from the college
laundry rooms is a problem that has
been overlooked on campus. A few
weeks ago I had nearly $70 worth of
clothing stolen from adryerin Loose
Pit and there is nothing I can do
about it. Someone took my green
and blue rugby jersey and my red
Grinnell sweatshirt (but left my
favorite undies — thanks, buddy). I
cannot afford to replace these items
every time they get dirty.

There is nothing my rcsidentadvi-
sor, student affairs, or I can do to

report this incident, but the cam
community should know that the
a problem, and the only soluti
can propose right now is res.
Respect not only for political \si
sexual preference, and hippie orp

hippie status, but for personal
longings. ’
To whoever took my clothes
you have my clothing, please ret
it to box 11-22 or my room in R
Pit. Please do not take anyone e‘l
property. Can we not all learn

respect each other? 1
