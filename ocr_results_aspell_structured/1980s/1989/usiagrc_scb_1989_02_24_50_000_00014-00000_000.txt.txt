How will your lack of SGA experience hurt

you?
Alanna Tyler

I don’t think it will hurt me
at all because in my off-campus
experiences I have teamed about
parliamentary procedure and the
workings of an institution.
Also, I don‘t think that SGA is

so complex a beast that a student
at Grinnell couldn't figure it out.
I have the ability to think and I
have that familiarity with
parliamentary procedure, and the
ability to learn what I don't
know.

Did you make any mistakes when you ran
last year that you have corrected this

year?
Jefff Fields

Well, I'm having a hard time
saying this, but I guess I was a
little——l was overrobnoxious. I
ran last year because I thought I
could do the best job. And it was
my purpose, my self-proclaimed
purpose, to put anyone who
disagreed with me on the spot.
And in my stating that I thought
I was the best person, it got a
little bit out of hand. If I had to
do it again,l don’t think I could
have done it any other way,
because of the situation I was
in—as far as applicable
experience goes, I did not have
the most experience. So I had to
draw attention to those features

which i thought would encourage
people to vote for me. And my
personality and [the fact that] 1
work differently than the
candidates I ran against last year,
that's something I tried to
highlight. And l'ni changing
things this year, but very little.
I‘m not having a thrcerweek
campaign period. I‘m not going
to make everyone sick of seeing
Jefff Ficlds' posters tllis year.
though you will see them. But]
did things the way I wanted to
last year, and I was pretty
satisfied. I made my mark, and
hopefully this year, I’ll make my
mark by winning.

What vgill you do to improve
communication between students and

SGA?
Matt Moreland

Setting myself in a position
to be as approachable as a hall
senator is to students if they want
to voice something to me. The
president should be that way, too.
I don‘t think they should be
isolated over in the SGA office,
locking themselves in there. I
know there’s a lot of work to be
done, a lot of time to be spent.
but I think they should be out
and approachable.

Another thing, hanging out
on floors, stopping by floors.
I’ve been a student adviser and I
know how floors hang out and
you can talk to a lot of people at
that time. Once again, I
understand the time constraints.
You need to be totally realistic
about it. I think my personality
in general will narrow the gap
quite a hit, just in being
approachable.

Will your "multi-perspectivity" cause
problems when dealing with faculty on
Curriculum Committee?

Alanna Tyler

There is always a danger
when you’re representing a very
diverse group of people that in
order to satisfy everyone, you
have to come up with something
that is vague or watered down. In
this case, I don't think I would
have to wony about that as much
because, althouglt the student
body is diverse, the diversity is
not so great and the students so
unwilling to hear the other
person’s side of it that they

investing in the college rather
than investing in PR. Having a
doctor on campus would be a
valuable addition to the Grinnell

community. This would be
shown in people‘s perception of
the campus as being very
concerned and geared toward the
students. I think it‘s attractive to
prospectives. So my feeling is

would always be unmoved on
certain things. People are
willing to compromise, and that
would certainly make it easier to
take something before the
Curriculum Committee that
would represent the entire student
body. It would be difficult at
some times. but I think that‘s the
only way to go into a situation.
I‘d rather go into the situation

CARLET AND BLACK

In your statement you mention the
"obvious inadequacies" of the 3-2 change.
What are those inadequacies?

Jefff Fields

I want to start off by saying
that implementing the 3-2
program last year was wrong.
The way the program, the
teaching schedule, . . . eliminates
so many classes, such a large
number of classes, that the only
way, the only fair way, to
students and faculty members to
implement it would be over a
period of time, where the number
of faculty would have been
increased before the program went
into effect. And I know that. ..
for a while it would have made
the students think they were in
heaven, with having so many
more choices to choose, but then
again, it wouldn't have made
them think they were in hell,
where so many students are
getting locked out of classes, so
many classes are being closed,
And so many students are being
ignored by profs, Not purposely,
but when you change and take a
class that every year is 18 or 19
people, then it’s 35, someone’s
going to get ignored. You take a
discussion class like that, the
bottom five, to, is people are
not going to get a chance to talk
in that class. Whereas in a class,
take, I guess, the bottom third of
the class, not the bottom third,
but the third of the class that does
not talk, if, in a class of 20
people, that third is six or seven
people, and a professor can en-
courage, [catl] say. ”Oh, I have
six or seven people that don’t
talk. I should encourage them to
talk." But in a class that increases
from 20 people to 30 people, that
number increases to 10. It makes
it that much more difficult for a
professor to encourage everyone
to talk while slaying on schedule
and completing all the material
that the professor would like to
do during the semester. And at
this point, I’m still not satisfied
with the preparation . . . to make
the 3-2 more agreeable to
students. I would think it‘s
agreeable to everyone right now
except professors and students,
and after that, I don't know who‘s
left, as far as the 32 program
goes. I'm seeing professors
doing the same work they were
doing last year. Except . . . they
don't have to go to class as
much, but they’re correcting as

negotiate rather than go in with
only my perspective, because
what‘s good for me might not be
good for the rest of the students.

How will the duties of you research
committee head mesh with the

parliamentarian?

Simon Levin

The parliamentarian would
still run the student initiatives.
It would be the job of the
research committee to research
initiatives to find out why
currently the change hasn’t been
made, how much the change
would cost, what the change
would do. Even before the
proposal gets to the initiative
stage, the research committee
would take action and be
reporting back and working with
the student or students who’s
running the initiative helping
them deﬁne, clarify, and answer
many of tile students’ questions.

I think we‘d have less initiatives
coming to a head because they‘d
be better researched. A research
committee would have more
doors open to it than a student or
students who are not part of
student government. Then when
the initiative comes to a head it
would be the parliamentarian’s
duty to put it on the ballot for
students to vote on ' It would
be the parliamentarian’s duty to
notify appropriate people and
hopefully work with the research
committee in submitting
proposals to the administration
on how to effectively install the
improvement.

many papers, they're preparing
for as many students. I don't see
the change. But I do see the
change where students that are
frustrated because they can‘t find
a seat in class. They have to go
the class next door and bring a
chair into the classroom. That’s
ridiculous. This school has the
facilities to provide for its
students. Students should not
have to go find a chair. You’re
one minute early for class, sorry,
you don‘t get a chair? You don't
get a desk to write on? That’s
ridiculous, We don't have the
facilities for classes as large as
they are this year. We don‘t have
the facilities to accommodate
classes that are the size we have
this year. Whereas I agree that
the professors are worked hard,
sometimes overworked, many of
them think they are overworked,
and I would say if they think they
are overworked, then they
probably are. I’m not the one to
say that they’re not. But, I don’t
think that it was fair to the
students to change to the 3-2
schedule and not think long-term.
I’m sure someone saw the
problems. I don't doubt that we
have very intelligent people
running this college, very capable
people. But I don’t think
students were considered.
Whereas the faculty has five
years, or four years, or three
years, or however long is time to
implement a 3.2 program, for a
student who’s here four years, and
I‘m sure that a freshman who
came this year, or even worse, a
freshman who came last year, and
saw the change, and notices the
big difference in the change, by
the time that freshman graduates,
that person, what is it, the class
of ‘92? Students in the class of
‘92: they got here with many,
many courses to choose from,
very little problem getting into
those classes, very good courses
because they were the proper size,
a good size. They didn‘t have to
deal with getLing their own chairs
if they came to class a minute
late, They didn‘t have to deal
with not really having a chance
to know their professor because
they were one of the quiet people,
or not being able to talk in class,
or not having the chance to talk
in class, because there were five

Bailey recommends frequent
hand-washing as one of the best
means of prevention. “Good
handrwashing techniques are
essential," said Bailey.
“Someone with the virus might
sneeze, touch a door handle, and
then you might touch it after
them. If you rub your eyes after
that it is very easy for the Virus
to enter your system.” Although
she conceded that the pressure keg
of academic studying at Grinnell
makes plenty of sleep and good
eating habits difficult, these are
also important for maintaining
immunity.

choices

Those are the candidates that we
choose to endorse: Rob Killion
for president anti Alanna Tyler for
viceapresidcnt.

Both Killion and Tyler have
the best potential for becoming
effective leaders of the student
body.

Killion's extensive experience
in SGA and his realistic goals for
next year clearly make him the
best qualified candidate for
president.

As vice-president, Tyler will be
able to effectively articulate the
views of the student body. Her
past experiences make her well
qualified to deal with the faculty
and the administration, and she is
firmly committerl to representing

more vocal people or 10 more
vocal people who were more
vocal in their class. This year
they have to deal with these
problems. They’re getting closed
out of classes. There are majors
not offering required courses this
year. As far as I’m concerned,
that’s wrong. If a major has a
course that's required, it should
be offered, especially a 300alevel
course. And I can pick speciﬁc

wrong. That should not be

Adding four or five positions

don’t think we’ll be at that level
where we‘re offering the same

body, participated in the annual
flu vaccination. Bailey said this
low turnrout could be partly
responsible for the increase in flu
cases. Usually recommended for
people over the age of 65 and
people with chronic conditions
such as asthma, bronchitis, and
AIDS, the flu vaccine can also be
effective for students, according
to Bailey. ”When you have a lot
of people living in close quarters,
under a lot of stress, and not
getting a lot of sleep it is likely
that the flu can spread."

Although the vaccine is not
guaranteed to prevent the flu,
Bailey said she favors students
getting vaccinated. ”The bottom
line is that I would really
recommend students get the flu
vaccine," said Bailey. “I know
some people are fearful of needles
but I'm more fearful of the flu."
