ClaSh: This week -- the new calendars

' ately I’ve come to the concluc
that there are sets of minor an-
,anees which, when comr
ded together, make life on this
net 2 living hell. I used to Lhink
e things were all the result of
c bizarre infernal conspiracy,
ineered by tclcvangelists or
ething. but I guess I’ve mar
d somewhat and now take a
rercalistic view ofthings. Inow
ize that all the things pestering
lately are completely unrelated.

admiration, “Boy, this is quality!”
Ordinarily I couldn‘t care less, but
have you noticed that these things
are next to useless? Just about the
only correctly scheduled event is
the commencement speech by
Gcncva Overholscr, the exalted
editor of the Dex Moines Register
(You can be sure she's sought the
world over, so this is clearly 2 big
coup forourcampus). ”Why,” you

Fiasco I heard u lot of noise about
how the future SGA wasn't going
to allow changes such as this (1.0.
directly annoying students) to be
enacted without some sort of stuA
dent input, or at least forewurning,
So where was it? I don't know
whether to blame the admtnistra-
tivecabal for making decisions like
this in secret or SGA/students for
their hypocrisy. But I know thatl

Surely someone deserves to have

From Student
Viewpoint of the
Administration:

The group least interested in the
concerns and interests of Grinnell
College students when it comes to
policy that affects students is,
umiortundtcly, the faculty. The
faculty pur-ricw is over thc
curriculum, and there lilcy exert un
exclust ontroi. There are some
good reasons for faculty to lrnvc
control over the curriculum. It is

understandable, even dcsirrblc, to
have cducutors determine how best
to educate. The members of the
faculty who teach have more
expertise in their subjects than do
students or administration. so it
makes sense to allow them some
control over which courses will be
trught. Professors hrve Ph.D.'s in
their disciplines, students do not
even have B.A.'s.

Although professors and
students have some differences in
expertise. they have, rs I have
often reminded myself after a
particularly frustrating mating
with faculty, more in common with
students than not (and more than
they would like to think). Both are
human beings. and both
intelligent. Often, however, it
would seem that faculty use tlle
distinction oi degree as an excuse
to ignore Lhc voice of the students.
In my two and a half years as a
member of the Curriculum
Committee. tllc only committee
with student membership that
oversees the curriculum, I often felt
|hal students were viewed as
unwelcome guests by faculty
members. in spite of the frcr that
student participation on
committees working with the
curriculum it» among the most
intelligent, thoughtful, and mrturc

or rny work done in student
govcmment, Besides. students are
certainly as involved in the
educational process as faculty.
They may not have the degree. but
they are more in touch with the
process of learning. with what it
means to be it student. |han are
faculty members, who have often
not been students for many years,
If faculty members would listen,
student participation would be a
valuable improvement to the
Grinnell curriculum.

Unfortunately, the ability and
usefulness of student Contributions
to discussions regarding the
curriculum are ortcn toruily
ignored. I hate to say it. but often
it is true. that with some faculty
nrcmbers, arrogance has either rcr
placed intelligence, or in some
cases. merely followed it, I am not
saying that there are many faculty
meinbcrs who are bad professors,
But they ortcn have terrible
attitudes about working with
students. The Student Affairs ideal,
that of treating students as adults so
that they will act as adults, ts lost
on mos| faculty, rcpluccd by an
attttttde such as “we must control
these this lest they run things
amuck. Alter All, we h. Ph D's."
(Chapter t, pp. 24 25.)

In an interview for the Scarlet
and Black, Don Smith clarified
his opinion of what should
constitute a baccalaureate
curriculum:

“I believe. for example, but
I‘m only speaking for myself
here and it has nothing to do with
the Curriculum Committee. that
a person who is a bachelor of ans
should be able to read and
understand and, to a degree.
communicate in a language
besides one‘s own language. And
that such a person should be able
to have a certain level of fluency
and experience in mathematics.
for example. i would be prepared
to make those things
requirements for the degree.“

He commented further: “I'm
always happy to listen to
students, but I think ﬁnally and
ultimately the custody of
baccalaureate, the final "3.
sponsibility for baccalaureate
education at the college. rests
with the faculty. And the
Curriculum Committee is a
faculty commillec which students
have been invited to sit on. But
it's riot an allxcollegc committee;
it's a faculty committee."
