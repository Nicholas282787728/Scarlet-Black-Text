Grunting Into Their Second Year in Print

By Sharyn Obsatz

“If it was up to some people on
campus, no one would ever laugh at
anything," said Bill Thompson, who,

When asked about his initial re-
fusal to print Grunt. Walker said, “I
wanted to have a chance to talk to the
presidentaboutthis." Walker admit-

thatl talked to loved it,“ he said. On
the issue of student acceptance,
Thompson said, “We saw a lot of

along with Mike Maule, cre-
ated Grunt, the Grinnell Col—
lege Lampoon, to rectify this
situation. The sole purpose of

to make people laugh. It’s en-
tertainment."

The premiere issue of Grunt
came out at the end of last
semester, and contained hu-
morous articles on religion,
politics, social groups and the
Grinnell way oflife written by
Maule, Thompson and other
contributors.

The idea for a lampoon at
Grinnell had existed for some
time. One of Thompson‘s
friends was very involved with

never got any official feed-

nervous aboutthe reception of
their first issue. “It was our

said that he felt most people
realized the issue was “poking

Maule has decided to con-

Maule had been a hall senator last
semester and knew that money was
available for such a project. They
okayed the idea with the administra—
tion and then wentto work. “George
Drake was really supportive from
square one." Maule said.

As word of the lampoon spread,
people gradually began to send in
articles. Maule served as the admin-
istrator and Thompson did the lay-
out. The issue was printed up in
May, despite some complications
with its reception at the service bu-
reau. The day after it was submitted
to be printed, Thompson received
theoriginal copy in his mailbox along
with a note which said, “The service
bureau will notprint this here; ifyou
have any questions talk to Waldo
Walker." This was the Gmnt staff’s

ted, “I think the issue is tasteless,but
there are a lot of tasteless publica»
tions out there."

Yet, according to Walker. the
quwtion of whether to printthe issue
was not one of censorship, but rather
one of “whether it should be printed
oncollegefunds."“Anythingprinted
at the service bureau is subsidized
with college money, funds which
are meant to serve the college’s prir
mary mission: education," he said.
Walker said he was uncertain
whether Grunt pertains to this mis-
sion.

In the end, Walker explained that
he “decided not to argue about it."
Thus, the issue was printed.

Within two days of publication,
all 800 copies of Grunt were gone
from the post office. Maule felt the
issue was well»rcccived.

Looking Past the Handicaps

By Heather Terrence

The idea of “camp" for most stu-
dents conjures up images of hordes
ofchildren running through woods,
swimming, playing games, making
craft projects and generally havinga
good time. However, many children

handicaps have few opportunities to
enjoy the fun of camping. For that
reason, camps specially designed for
these challenges have been created,
including Catnp Courage in Minne-
sota and Camp Sunnyside outside of
Des Moines.

Model U. N. Meets in Grinnell

By Craig Hooper

The Grinnell College Model
United Nations Tuesday night held
its first meeting. at which the ﬂedg»
ling organization proceeded to set
the foundation for what is hoped to
be a dynamic year.

The Model U.N. has received
funding from S.G.A. and is petitionr
ing the Roscnfield program to see if
the college will subsidize travel to
Model U.N. conventions in the re-
gion. The club is also seeking a [acr
ulty sponsor willing to accompany
the group to the conventions.

The organization debates current
issues, holding with the format of
the Unified Nations itself. Its goals
are to increase student awareness of
the world and to introduce students
to the procedure of the UN. As one
organizer put it, “Hopefully it helps
toputtheoutside worldonthe map."

The nucleus of the club consists
of people who have had experience
in other Model U.N. chapters. The
founder of the club, freshman Ed-
ward Nginilla, participated in the
group during his high school years,

attended the All-Africa Model U.N.
atNirobeand the lntemational Model
U.N. at Hague. He has placed as one
of the top ten speakers at the All-
Africa convention for three years,
winning, in his words, “a ﬂashy
diploma and a good reputation.“
NginillahopcstheGrinncllbianch
will be invited this spring to the
Model U.N. convention in New

York, the biggest college U.N. can I

vention in the world.

‘Meditation 17

Todd Rowekamp all spent their
summers working at such camps.
Kitty Louis. who worked at Camp
Sunnyside,spen112-hourdays work-
ingwithphysicallyanddevelopmen»
tally disabled people of all ages. The
camp held ten sessions during the
summer. Campers for each session
were either physically or mentally
handicapped and from aspeciﬁc age
group. Louis, an arts and crafts in-
structor, created two new activitiesa
day for the five day camps.

Although her free time was lime
ited to merely an hour a day and all
of Saturday, she felt the experience
was extremely rewarding. “You have
to be willing to sacrifice a lot of
time," she said, but added that you
team to put aside prejudices and
sympathies and work with a person,
not a handicap.

Todd Rowecamp participated in a
similar program at Camp Courage,
in Minnesota, from June to August.
The camp is divided into two scc-
tions.oneforphysicallyhandicapped
people and another which includes
programs for children with speech
and hearing impairments, mentally
handicapped youth, inner»city kids
and children with cancer. Each of
these camps lasted one to three
weeks.

Rowekamp also worked 12~hour
days and found that working with so
many young people, many of whom
were hyperactive, was “very tiring.
but at the same time a good experi-
ence.” Both Louis and Rowekamp
recommend working as a camp
counselor for people who are cncrr
getic, willing to learn about them
