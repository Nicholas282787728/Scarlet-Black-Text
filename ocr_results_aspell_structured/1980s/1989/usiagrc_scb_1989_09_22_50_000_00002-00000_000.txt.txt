Building a ‘Habitat for Humanity’

September 22, 1989

The Return ofoteldon Zitner

 

By Jennifer Kern
and Julie Kaster

”Everyone will have at least a
simple, decent place to live," says
the creed of Habitat for Humanity,
as invoked by its founder and direc»
tor, Millard Fuller. Fuller’s vision of
adequate housing for all was on its
way to becoming a reality when. in
1977, he began working on dilapi-
dated housing in Americus, Geor-
gia, later to become Habitat’s inter-
national headquarters.

Grinnell College could soon be-
come a part of Fuller’s vision, ace
cording to students Kent Koth and
Kevin Herrick, who are working to
establish a chapter of Habimt for
Humanity here in Grinnell.

Koth and Herrick are part of a
small group of Grinnell students
spending time on Saturdays work-
ing with the Des Moines chapter of
Habitat for Humanity. The group,
now in its third year, has success
fully completed six houses and is at
work on a seventh,

Whatisneeded to establisha group
chapter here, said Herrickand Koth,
is a demonstration of long-term
commitment through consistent
numbersandcontinue/dcampussupe
port for the program.

Work done on houses is varied,
and there is something for everyone
at a project site. Though students
with construction experience would,
of course, be helpful, “Anyone who
can hold a hammer is qualified,"
Herrick said.

Most houses renovated by Habitat
are donated or abandoned. and ob
tained from the city. The houses
chosen are generally structurally
sound but need significant renova-
tions such as electrical wiring, paint-
ing, dryrwalling and possibly de-
tailed construction.

Habitat allots houses on the basis
of need to families widi children.
Applicants are accepted only after
research proves that they are other
wise unable to find a place to liver

The background of the potential
homeowners is immaterial as long
as they are honestand demonstrate a
commitment to the project.

Habitat requires applicant fami-
lies to put in 200 hours on another
project house before even being
considered for a home of their own.
Once a family is in line for a house,
they must devote an additional 300
hours of time to its renovation.

After a family has moved into its
home, they are expected to pay rent

sidering that the average market
value of these houses is $35,000, the
financial benefits provided by Habi-
tat are considerable.

For a few brief weeks, professor
Sheldon Zitner — “a wandering
scholar,” he says 7 has returned to
Grinnell College after an absence of
20 years to lecture on English litera-
ture.

Hers teaching in his areaofexper»
tise, Shakespearean drama, in a
special topics courseoffered forhalf
the semester, ”Shakespeare’s Probe
lem Plays.“ He has recently written
a book on Shakespeare‘s Aii’s Well
that End: Wail which will be avail»
able sometime this fall.

Zitner taught atGrinnell from 1956
to 1969. After leaving Grinnell, he
went to Trinity College in Toronto,
Canada, where he has been teaching
until now. At Trinity, he taught
mainly English drama and literary
theory. He says he was attracted to
Trinity because of its similarities to
Grinnell’ssmall,close-knitenviron-
merit.

Why did he Choose to leave his
favorite city, Toronto, and return to
Grinnell? “They asked me,” he said
_ but added that he also wanted to
see old friends and satisfy hiscurios-
ity about how the college had
changed.Heclaims that some things
never change: “the clean air, the
peace and quiet" and the one-on-one

relationships — rare at most col-
leges — that Grinnell professors still
have wim students.

Zimer said he hopes students real-
ize that “you and your parents are
getting a great bargain” with a Grinr
nell education.

What will he do when he leaves
Grinnell this semester? With a slow,
misehievious grin he replted, “Most
people who leave Grinnell get work.
Maybe I should do the same."

 

Sheldon Zitner.

Zitner will give a lecture this
Mondayat7:30p.m.in Southbounge
entitled “Reading a Tudor Sonnet"
which he says “will appeal to people
interested in history and literature"
Zitner says he plans to interpret the
sonnet in its historical context.

GAY AND LESBIAN TASK FORCE

 

Continuedfram p. I

to face the demonstrators and televi-
sion cameras and when he turned to
go back inside, most of the protest»
ers followed, jamming the building
with a snaking singlefile line to the
president‘s secretary. Each asked to
make an appointment to speak with
Drake about the housing disputer
pute.

In a referendum on May 2. almost
half the student body voted on the
issue, with 420 votes in support of
recognizing lesbian and gay mar-
riages and 69 against.

Cooley and Barbour were married
May 6 in Main Hall lounge by Cole
lcge chaplain Dennis Haas before
about 30 invited guests.

Drake now says he turned the
couple down outof fear that“a good
many heterosexual students would
feel that they too ought to come
under this clause.”

“We were drinking ofthis issue as
a precedentrsctting issue and that
was what concerned us so. We were
thinking of how many other cases
we will have to deal with." Drake
said. “I have never underestimated
the ingenuity of Grinnell College
students to make arguments to sup-
port their case."

Melanie Cooley said the college's
actioris were “a backward step as
opposed to a forward step.”

“It was an insult to Jennifer’s and
my relationship. It was an insult to

lesbian and gay relationships every-
where." she said. “Instead of living
up to their image that they promote
of themselves of being a very open
and accepting campus they cringed
at the idea of talo'ng an actual step
that would prove they really are what
they claim to be."

Cooley said the proposed housing
for married students would be “a
reasonable compromise, as long as
the same rules are in effect for both
gay and non-gay couples." It is
unclear whether the couple could
live in a marriage dorm, because
Jennifer Barbour is not a Grinnell
student. Barbour is a second-year
nursing student at Marshalltown
Community College.

Drake said that in making the
decision last spring there was also
the question of the college‘s image.
“Moreand more as we debated it, the
issue was shifted from the college‘s
housing policy to, ‘Will Grinnell
College stand up and take a position
on a matter of great importance to
our society, and a position that by
and large would be regarded as
unpopular in the society?m Drake
saidr

“Particularly in this state we
wondered if we could put ourselves
that far outon this issue. We‘re still
wondering," he said.

Is the administration won'ied that
Grinnell will be seen as a “gay col—

lege“?

“I would be less than honest ifI
didn’t say that that‘s always there,"
Drake said.

“In a sense, we’re going to have to
let the chips fall where they may. I
mean, we are what we are," he said.
“People are going to come to the
conclusions thatthey‘ll cometor In a
sense we can'tworry too much about
it.

“In another sense, obviously, I’d
say for the balance of the commu»
nity here you would not want it to be
thought that this is, quote, a gay
college and that almost everyone at
the college is a gay person. That's
nottrue. And itjustisn‘trepresenta»
tive of the community that we have.
So we would likean accuratcpicture
of the college to be reflected," Drake
said.

“Grinnell already has a fairly proA
nouncod image of beingquite liberal
and open. So that most people who
even look at the college are prepared
for a fairly liberal and open commu-
nity," he said, Drake said that Grin-
nell‘s prospective students “are by
and large people who are prepared to
accept a very diverse community —
and are maybe even seeking IL"

“But ultimately, the guiding prinr
ciple has to be, we just liave_to do
what we think werhould do," Drake
said.

“Ultimately the issue is what is
right,” he said.
