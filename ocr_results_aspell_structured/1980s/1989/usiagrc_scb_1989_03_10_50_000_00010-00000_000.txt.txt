Wang worries for
campus visitors

To the editor.

I was walking home from
Quad along the sidewalk that
leads in front of Burling on
Thursday morning. On my way,
I saw a man standing in front of
The Directory near the Mears
parking lot, staring at it
quizzically. When he noticed me
approaching, he quickly turned
toward the directory and stared
intently, tracing a path from the
parking lot to North Campus,
and then back to the Forum with
his finger. But after I had walked
past him, the bewildered stare
returned to his face. Obviously,
he was confused.

My initial reaction was to
lament the de-pcrsonalization that
is the terrible price which each
and every one of us must pay for
attending a large, nay, gargantuan
institution like ours, which needs
such directories.

But then I started to think.
This man couldn’t help but know
that he was at the right school,
thanks to our ingenious. twice-
thcrfunefor-the-price-of-onc logo
slash visual identification
system. I mean, come on, those
cars in the parking lot, with the
broad horizontal graphic and
classic typography (on both the
driver‘s door AND the
passenger‘s door) couldn’t be
found at, oh, say, Carleton. But
still, the man was quite confused
So did our school pay $6,000 per
for directories that visitors can't

understand?
terrible shame.

Being an aware and concerned
campus member, I 512".ch to
think about what could be done
to alleviate this problem. Should
we instigate a standardized map~
reading skills test for anyone who
wants to visit our campus? And
then, assuming that they passed,
would we let these potential
visitors apply “earlyrdecision,”
and supply financial aid for those
visitors who couldn‘t afford to
visit the campus with their own
resources? Maybe learning how
to use the directories could
become a pan of the New Student
Days orientation program. Or
maybe we should print directions
for using the directories on the
valuable and complete annual
activities calendars which we send
out to incoming freshmen and
prospectives, so that as soon as
they an'ive at Grinnell. they'll be
able to ﬁnd their way to all of the
accurately scheduled events
around campus.

Whatever the solution to this
crisis may email, we as a campus
community must solve it
quickly, or else we risk having
masses of visitors wandering
aimlessly around campus. The
post office and classrooms are
overcrowded as it is. And
besides, how would we be able to
distinguish visitors from B and G

Reader feels Tower's
worst actions have
been overlooked

To the editor.

Joel Shapiro‘s criticisms of
senators' actions regarding the
nomination of John Tower are
accurate only to a point. I too
am angered by the lemming-like
criticism of Tower’s drinking at
the expense of more serious is
sues. Unfortunately, Shapiro
failed to even mention what I
consider to be the most
incriminating aspects of Tower‘s
past. By all accounts John
Tower is a dnrnk and a sexist of
epic proportion, What has been
overlooked is that he has also
been a staunch defender of the
Criminal actions of the CIA and
FBI.

It is no coincidence that John
Tower was chosen by former
president Reagan to investigate
Iran-Contra. (As an aside, the
Tower report puts an interesting
light on Bush‘s loyalty to the
nominee.) Tower has a long his
tory of down-playing police-slate
activuy in the US. In the early
‘705 Tower served as the vicc~
chairman of the Senate Select
Committee charged with investi-
gating domestic intelligence. As
a member of this committee,
Tower was told of appalling FBI
and CIA abuses reminiscent of

totalitarian regimes. Among the
discoveries related in the
committee’s final report was the
long-standing war waged by the
FBI against Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr, The FBI illegally
opened private letters, infiltrated
meetings, bugged the hotel room
where Dr. King was staying,
mailed anonymous letters with
the intent of destroying Dr.
King‘s marriage. More omir

Student stresses that
Grinnell is not Carleton

To the editor.

This issue has been heating
up in the back of my mind until
it finally reached the boiling
point. For several years now the
administration has been engaged
in various activities which many
ofthe students here disagree with:
core curriculum, spending inordir
nate sums on promotion of the
school instead of on the quality
of the school, etc.

(Would not $40,000 be better
spent on improving the weakest
part of the college facilities, the
library, instead of on a new logo
and directories! The administra-
tion seemed to barely question

the necessity of a new logo, at
least not publicly, and at the
same time quickly denied the li-
brary committee’s request for
additional funds. But this is an
other issue.)

One of the justifications is
invariably, “Well, at Carleton . .
." At Carleton they reportedly
raised tuition 15 percent. Al
Carleton they have greater rc-
quiremcnts for graduation. At
Carleton they have a more
stressful environment. At Car-
leton they have a higher suicide
rate.

Theory vs. reality in
ideologies is discussed

To the editor.

There is a trend among
academics and scholars to judge
communism not upon the actions
of communist governments but
rather upon the promises of
Utopia sounded by Marxist
theoreticinns. Unfortunately,
Grinnell is not immune from this
intellectual malaise. I have found
that many students at Grinnell
believe that Marxism is a
superior political-economic
system compared to America‘s
present capitalist and democratic
republic based upon Marxist
theory and American reality.
Communism is the only
ideology in history to be judged
by what it says and not what it
does. Idealistic intellectuals cling
to Marxist socialist beliefs
because they view Marxism as
good in theory. The dismal
economic failures and grotesque
crimes against humanity

Centrist

committed by Marxist regimes
[are] dismissed by idealistic
socialists in the West as
perversions of true socialism as
envisioned by Karl Marx. The
justification for continued
adherence to Marxist socialism
advanced by idealistic leftists in
the West is that the Soviet Union
and other regimes that proclaim
themselves as being socialist
governments based upon Marxist
economic theories are neither
Marxist or socialists. This
argument would sound absolutely
ridiculous if put into the context
of another discredited ideology.

Nazism (national socialism)
is an ideal political and economic
ideology in theory: however, no
one has put national socialism
into practice as envisioned by
Drexler. Drexler, a theoretical
genius on the same level as Karl

School had the choice to go to
either Carleton or Grinnell. 0b-
viously they chose Grinnell.
They did so because of the differ
ences, many of which the admin-
istration is trying to eliminate.
This may come as a shock to
some, but we are not Carleton,
and we will never be Carleton. It
is time to concentrate on what
Grinnell is, instead of what it is
not. If I had known’that the
administration had such an
inferiority complex, I may have
chosen to go to Carleton instead.
Ann E. Haker, ‘89

political

Marx, developed the theory of
national socialism to solve the
problems inlterent in the
capitalist system. Unfortunately
for the reputation of national
socialism, Hitler perverted the
ideals of Drexler much as Lenin
and Stalin perverted the ideals of
Marx. The utopian society that
would have resulted from a proper
implementation of Drexler’s
national socialism has not arisen
yet because no true national-
socialist government has ever
been formed.

Nobody defends Nazism [on
the grounds that] it is good in
theory despite its failures in
practice. It is equally ludicrous
to defend Marxism in theory
despite its failures in practice.
Ideologies, like people. should be
judged by what they do, not what
they say. 1. Otto I’ohl
