Students ‘Just Say No’
To Anti—Drug Initiative

Students rejected an anti-drug
initiativebyawidemarginWednes-
day in a campus referendum held by
the Student Government Associa-
tion.

of the 498 students who voted, 58
percent, or287 people, voted against
the initiative, while 42 percent, or
211 people, voted for it. Just over 39
percent of the student body voted on
the question.

The initiative said that the stu-
dents of Grinnell College “believe
that the illegal use of controlled
substances" is “harmful to the health,
safety and economic well being of
the people of the United Smtes.” It
said Grinnell students “oppose any
illegal possession, use or selling of
controlled substances."

The initiative was proposed by

Kevin Pollpeter, chairperson of
Campus RepublicansPollpeter said
the initiative wasn’t a Campus Re-
publicans issue, but was an effort to
unite the campus under the anti-drug
cause.

“We weren't trying to prove any-
thing byit."Pollpeter said. “Wewere
just more or less trying to see if we
could unite the campus to say, 'Yes,
we’re against the illegal use of

Pollpeter said he saw the initiative
mostly as “an opinion poll."

Sophomore Mike Kent saidhewas
disappointed in the results — evi-
dence, he said, that Grinnell students
aren‘tlooking too far from their own
concems. “It seems a little ironic

Police In New York City

By Diane Brumley

Police in New York City have
been unable to locate Shahzad
Ahmad, the suspect in an October
knifing here that ended a back-alley
ﬁght, because of confusion over the
wanted man’s exact name.

Grinnell police say Queens Col-
lege, where Ahmad is said to be a
student, has four students with the
lastnarneAhmad—notoneofwhom
has the first name Shahzadr

Ahmad is being sought for his
involvement in the fight Oct. 22
between five Grinnell college stu-
dents and five local teenagers, The
fightbegan in the Bar as verbal har-
assment, move/:1 outside onto Main
St. and ended in an alley when

of the townspeople involved. The

cut was not life-threatening.

Grinnell students Ara Bulbulian,
Chris Gingetich, David Hess, Jef-
frey Shook and Scott Whipple
pleaded guilty to charges of disor-
derly conduct Nov, 6 in connection
with the ﬁght. Each was fined $77.50,

Ahmad. who is said to be from
Pakistan, was visiting a friend in
Grinnell when he somehow became
involved in the ﬁght.

”There is no problem with the last

lies in the fact that Queens College
doesn’t have any record ofa Shah-

sen of the Grinnell police depart-
ment. Grinnell police are trying to
enlist the help ofa New York police
precinct in identifying Ahmad and

In the New Women’s Alliance,
‘A Voice That Will Be Heard’

By Kim Eckart

Women employees of the college
now have a formal voice on campus.

The Women’s Alliance, a pro»
sidentially appointed committee of
11 faculty and staff members, is in
their own words “a voice Lhatwill be
heard.”

According to committee chaier
Berkowitz-Gross,thecommittee was
appointed by college president
George Drake after requests from a
larger, more informal faculty-staff
group known as the Women’s Asso-
ciation. Drakechose from the groups
selected pool of candidates Lluee
faculty members. three administra-
tors, three support staff members,
one representative from dining serv-
ices and one representative from the
physical plant.

it is this inclusion of all employ-
ment areas that makes the Women’s
Alliance different from similar or-
ganizations at other colleges.

“Ours is unique because we staned
out as a support group, we asked for
ourown legitimacy,and we asked to
consider all employees," Berkow-
iu-Gross'said. She added thatsimi»
lar groups on other campuses fo-
cused on women‘s studies. or were
seen primarily as a task force.

Employment and promotion of
women are two of the committee's
key issues. Specifically, the alliance
examines women’s perceptions of
the college as an employer 7 its
Lreatmentof women, female oppor-
tunities for advancement and the
realization of an employee’s profes-
sional potential.

“We’re looking at the campus cli-
mate for women —— possible salary
differentials, opportunities for
women as opposed to men. The ad-
ministration is heavy with women at
the bottom levels. We don't have
strong female leadership." said Jan
Lively, director of fundraising at the
college.

Berkowitz-Gross identified the
focus as institutional consciousness-
raising. The committee emphasizes
the “general quality of the work
experience" —a topic not limited to
women.

“We don’t want to be seen as only
looking at the women‘s experience
as employees,“ Berkowitz-Gross
said. She added that the alliance
observes institutional patterns and
may recommend changes, but it is
not a grievance board.

posal to Drake said the role of the
alliance would be to “identify
women’s concems and issues on
campus, to coordinate efforts to
improve the campus climate for all
people, to target specific issues to be
addressed and to monitor these pro-
grams."
