Fatal Attraction : a
parable for the '805

by Brian Strause

Inevitably males leaving Fa-
ml Attraction will at least m
side; a life of ﬁdelity. But why?
is it really plausible that a one»
night stand of unbridled sex will
literally evolve into a blood-bath?
For some reason Adrian (9 1/2
Weeks) Lyne's rum certainly has
caused more than a few people to
think twice about sharing the
sheets with a stranger, perhaps
making Fatal Attraction as
effective a deterrent against
promiscuity in our disease-ridden
society as AIDS is. One might
venture so far as to say this film
is about AIDS, with Glenn Close
personifying the deadly disease.
At first glance Close is beautiful
and alluring, symbolizing what
might be construed as the
intriguing and inviting aspect of
the “decadent“ lifestyle our Culr
lure has attached to the infection
of AIDS. With ltcr seductive
glances Close 'casily turns
Michael Douglas’s head and her
fore you know it the two are
having sex like starved acrobats
in a salad of positions throughout
the kitchen. But take another
look at Close. l-lcr beauty is

wearing thin, melting into a sin-
ister shell of death. Its not that
her looks physically change, its
just that her bones become a lit-
tle more noticeable.

Douglas changes his phone
number, then his address but
Close keeps tracking him down,
claiming she is carrying his
baby, Obviously Close is about
as fertile as the Sahara Desert,
but she does her best to live out
the fantasy. lnTzict when the
rabbit doesn’t die, so to speak,
she kills it through artificial
means, offering a housewarming
present of rabbit stew, a bit on
the raw side. Aleithe gift
that keeps on giving.

JnSt like the condom com»
mcrcial that never uses the word
condom, but instead says safe sex
|S as easy as putting on a sock;
Ftttal Attraction addresses the is-
sue of the ‘80s in a purposefully
oblique fashion. Whatever the
means, the end result is a film
that has left a generation at least
thinking about the consequences
of a onenight stand.

The Fox and the Hound

This Friday and Sunday the
Films Committee is bringing
Disney’s The Fox and the Hound
to ARH. This film is different
than many of the Disney films
you might remember from your
childhood. For one thing it cost
12 million dollars to make. Yet,
it is also not that different, Even
though the film represents a
changing of the guard at Disney.
vvith a new generation of anima-
tors coming into their own at the
studio, there are no great techni-
cal departures from Disney tradi-
lion.

What changes there are, are
mainly thematic in nature. The
film is based on a book by
Daniel P. Mannix. We do not
have here one of the more cutesy
Disney films. The film starts
somberiy, with no music, only
blowing wind. From this

somber beginning. a tale is told
that hearkens back to early Dis-
ney with its focus on forces of
good and evil in the world.

The story is of a, well, fox
and a hound, who as mere
youngsters make a vow of eternal
friendship, not realizing that they
were born to be each others more
tal encmy. One must chase,
capture, and kill the other. Esr
sentially, although told for chil-
dren as an animated fantasy with
360,000 drawings (i 10,000
painted cells) whizzing by in
front of your eyes at 24 frames
per second. it is about the influ-
ence of environment on social
relations; of how the world
around us can affect our earliest,
most basic instincts.

High Society --
a musical
Philadelphia
Story

High Society is a Hollywood
musical comedy look at the idle
rich of the Eastern Seaboard. in
this adaptation oi '1‘ it e
Philadelphia Story. Bing Crosby
portrays a llappy-go-lucky
millionaire who longs to regain
the happiness he knew when he
was still married to Lhebcautiful,
spoiled rich gi l played by Grace
Kelly. T ' picture marks
Kelly's last appearance in motion
pictures bclore her marriage into
European royalty.

in the movie, Kelly’s
character feels torn between her
feelings for her fiance, a hard-
working boor who places her on
a pedestal, and her cit-husband,
Bing Crosby, who loves her in
spite of her imperfections. As
she prepares for her upcoming
wedding, Kelly‘s house is invaded
by Frank Sinatra and Celeste
Holme, playing two reporters
from a cheap gossip magazine
eager to get the “real" story about
the lives of the privileged class.
Various subplots develop,
including a brief affair between
Kelly and Sinatra.

The real attraction of the
film. however, lies in the
musical performances of both
Bing Crosby and Frank Sinatra,
two of the most talented popular
singers of the 20th Century. The
duet by these two is a rare treat,
considering that throughout their
careers they sang together but a
handful of times. An additional
musical attraction is the
appearance of jazz great Louis
Armstrong. His duet with
Crosby adds the perfect touch to
this whimsical romp through
Martha‘s Vineyard.
