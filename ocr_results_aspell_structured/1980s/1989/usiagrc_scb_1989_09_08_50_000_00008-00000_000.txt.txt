“I HAVE A DREAM”

September 8, 1989

FORGIVE AND FORGET?

 

Continued from p. 2

According to Jim Work, director
of the college’s “I Have a Dream"
foundation, tlte 50-student Moulton
class was picked because itincludes
many minority students who might
not consider going to college wiLh~
out some help paying the bills.

Drake acknowledged that $1,700
a year will not pay for full tuition
anywhere by the titne the students
reach college age in 1997. More
important, he said, will be tlte finan~
cial aid the schools will offer them.

“In fact what will happen is the
institutions to which these students
will apply will also have ﬁnancial
aid available. But it‘s the idea that
they recognize right now that there
is money out there, waiting for them.
Because to say, ‘Well, these schools
will provide you aid,’ is pretty ab-
stract to these kids. What counts is

that the money‘s sitting there in the
bank,waiting forthem," Drake said.
“Andwhatwillreally countsmoreis
what the institutions will givethem."

But money is only pan of the “I
Have a Dream" approach. The stu-
dents will also be introduced to a
“supportnetwork,”includingaclass
sponsor, studentmentors anda proj-
ect coordinator, who, along with
Grinnell alumni in Des Moines. will
meet regularly with the students,

”The obvious thing that] ought to
state is that the ‘I Have a Dream'
approach is much more nearly going
to address the problem at its most
imponant level, that is to say, atthe
level where you begin to inﬂuence
studentchoices aboutwhattheirlife
will be," Drake said.

He also said he hopes other insti—
tutions nearby catch on, “We’realso
extremely anxious that Des Moines
buy in to this approach, and that

other corporations and individuals
in Des Moines say, ‘That’s a good
idea, we‘ll do it, too’."

Drake said the original idea for
Grinnell‘s program came from Jim
Tederman, former Dean of Student
Affairs, who visited Eugene Lang to
discuss possible involvementby the
college,

Lang conceived of the program in
1981, when asked to speak at gradue
ation at his old elementary school in
New York City. Lang, now famous
for the move, says he threw out his
canned speech at the last moment
and decided to offer the graduating
class real inspiration: the promise of
tuition at the college of their choice.

Langisnowchainnanoftheboard
of trustees at Swanhmore College
and is said to be pressuring his own
board to follow Grinnell's lead in
sponsoring a class.

Connelly,whotaughttheartofwrit-
ing business letters in the Depart»
ment of Applied Foreign languages,
never felt the disruption in her class-
room,as her students were business-
men, not undergraduates She said
that it was “strange, because [my]
class was there, and it was [always]
justa normal day with people play-
ing basketball" outside the class-
room window. She found that so
many of the people who were not
students led relatively unchanged

ties without ﬂinching,

Peter Connelly experienced a bit
more disruption in his teaching be»
cause he was supposed to teach un»

dergraduale students at the univer-
sity, He went to the university each
day prepared to teach, but each day
was told that he would not have any
students, He focused his energiesin-

Although there was a sense of
normality for them at the university,
the foreigners did not remain unafe
fected by the developments. “Ev-
eryone was devastated," Peter Con-
nelly said. “There was not anything
you could do. You were there, and
you were not a part of it," Karin
Connelly added, “No one knew
exactly what had happened," except
that it was not good, They were
merely observers. Foreigners ac-
cepted that they were not there to

become involved so nopressure was
put on them to join the demonstra—
tions.

As Americans looking on with
American cultural views, the Con-
nellys had mixed reactions to the
unfolding events. On the one hand,
they did “not want to see people
being hurt.” a repeat of what hap«
pened in Beijing. On the other hand,
they questioned some of the infor-
mation they received, saying that
some of it was either misinterpreted
or misrepresented.

Karin Connelly says that she can
now seeboth sides of the news more
clearly.TheChinesestudentshelped
them to understand things “people
from my culture would not have"
understood, she said,

Both the Connellys agree that it
was a valuable experience, saying
they may have been present in the
“middle of a history-making upris-
ing.”Itwas.however,differentfrom
whatit would have been without the
demonstrations As Peter Connelly
said. in a more peaceful time, “We
would krlow more about social cusv
toms 7 how to hold your hands
when someone gives you something,
but much lessabouthow things work
when push comes to shove."

The college later requested that all
Nanjing faculty come home. Upon
returning to Grinnell, the Connellys
spoke with collegepresident George
Dlake, who asked, “How soon would
you bewilling to go back to China?”

And they answered in unison,
“Tomorrow,"

know about is the concern of the
townspeople for us college students.

Cindy Eakins, another waitress at
Thebonghomhasknownthevictim
for over fifteen years. ever since the
girls were ﬁve years old. Shortly
after the attack, Cindy had to go out
and get her friend “some nerve pills,
becausemshe’sjust a nervous mock."
In talking to me the other day, she
made a valid point that everyone ~
especiallycollegestudentswhomore
often walk than drive into town —
has to “try and be more careful,“
because you “have the satne chance
walking out of anywhere" that her
friend had “walking out the front
door of the restaurant.” Mike, my
customer, echoed these words and
expressed much concern wlten he
said (and I’m sure he meant no of-
fense in singling out the female gen-
der), “You college girls had better
really watch yourselves. You just
never know anymore." (Of course,
then he had to launch into the “things
just aren’t the same as when I was
young" speech, but the general senti-
merit and expression of concern still
remain the same)

Several other customers joined in
our conversation on that Tuesday
night,andsentmehome with various
instructions to be relayed to the “other
kids at the college." Among them
was: “If you're ever in trouble, you
just holler and we’ll come a-nrnnin’

just as fast as we can to help you
folks." Also, Mike and company gave
l‘um commands to never walk alone,
over and over and over again, And
they really meant it, The people of
Grinnell are really something, I
thought, as Mike walked me out to
my car when my shift was over, and
i looked up to see at least two anx—
ious, watching facm in the window,

As far as the 5'4", 120-pound
woman who had to defend herself
two Fridays ago. Cindy commented,
“Shehas always been strong, butwas
alsopretty lucky," Moral of thestory?
Don’t be so daft as to think that you,
too, will be so lucky. Take Mike and
his advice to heart (No, your mottl-
ers didn’t pay me to say this — I’m
just whoing my “Grinnell is great"
theme: the people of Grinnell really
do show genuine concern for the
members of the college community,
and this is not the first time.)

Cindy added as a closing com-
ment that some people made it hard
on her friend to deal with her experi~
ence, because “People just aren’t
smart enough to let her forget what
happened." But that’s not the case.
We’ll letthe victim try to forget her
experience, but we most cenainly
won‘tforget the ineidentandwe most
cenainly won’t ever forgive the bas-
tard who made us have to sit up and
once again have to be so cautious in
this sleepy, happy little town called

What adjusunents and improve~
merits will be made before Tuesday
night’s confrontation with Wart-
burg? “We will devote more time to
scrimmaging and concentrate on

game-specific drills," Coach Cain
promised. The goals for the 1989
Grinnell Women's Volleyball team
are to improve the overall record of
3-27 and to move up in the Midwest
Conference standings from tenth out

these goals relies quite simply on the
realization of individual potential and

Although Grinnell couldn't seem
to capitalize on the free kicks

perhaps these women should try
