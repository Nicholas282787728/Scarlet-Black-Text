:Roos Run At Central Regionals

« By Gerald Hontgstock

- Last Saturday, the men‘s cross
'eountry teamjourneyed to Waverly,

Iowa for the Central Regional Meet.
‘ _ Promptly at noon, the men’s race
,began. in a very crowded start, the

R003 fought their way through the
‘early going and were slightly spread
_outamongstthose teams striving for
Nationals.

Jonathan Lave was right wilh the
.leaders, including the eventual winr
‘ner from Simpson, Dave Halferty,

through the twormile point, but then
'he fell back due to an illness which
shad plagued him all week. Despite
his exhaustion, he still managed a
(gutsy 4:58 fifth mile and ended up
-35th overall.
_ Following him was David Sheri-
dan, who really came on strong late

in the season and had an excellent
race as well, to finish 461h.

Todd Rowekamp used a “head-
hunter" race strategy to help over»
come a stress fiacture which pre
vented him from training for the
three weeks prior to Conference: he
nearly caught up to Mark Couch,
whose race was also spectacular,
and the two Roos finished 63rd and
62nd, respectively.

Next for Grinnell was Chris Ger
man, who finished only 14 seconds
and yet 1 1 places behind Rowekarnp.

The other Roo senior in the race
besides Jonathan was Nick l-lopley,
who did an admirable job of filling
in for Jason Maples. Maples was
afﬂicted with strep throat only days
before the race.

Finally. the throes of disappoint-
ment were clearly written on Jeff

Ulmer’s visage as he swept through
the finish.

The Roos came away with a 10th-
place team finish, behind several
teams they had beaten all season. A
major factor was thesudden onset of
illness, which affected the perfon-n-
ances of several key runners.

To the plethora of spectators who
cheered on-Iheir favorite team. the
results were overshadowed by the
accomplishments of the squad
throughout the season. The team has
had a successful season, and never
lacked spirit or dedication.

With fourconsecutiveConference
victories under their belt, the Roos
of the future wrll certainly dedicate
themselves to attaining the goal
which has eluded them the past few
seasons — a chance to race with the
best at Nationals.

EBasketball Outlook: Cautious Optimism

By Charlie Frago

. It’s hoops time again, and the
Pioneers have been honingtheirslcills
(since Oct.22 under the watchful eyes
of new head coach David Arsenault
_and his assistant Chris Murphy.
Arsenault said helooks forward to
his inaugural season at the Pioneer
.ttelm with “cautious opumism."The
‘team lost several key players due to
graduation and injury. But the team
has shown an unbrindled enthusi-
asm and a good work ethic, leading
Arsenault to believe that the 1989-
?0 squad stands “a good chance of
achieving their potential."
, The players no doubt enjoy exe-
cuting Coach Arsenault’s up-tempo,
'wide-open offense and aggressive,
hustling defense. This style of play
perfectly suits the Pioneer person-
nel, including long-range bombadir
ErsShaanHamilton and captain Mike
Spurbeck, who have the ability and
willingness to take the three—point
shot Outside shooting is an impor
tant ingredientas itwill open up the
middle of the floor allowing point
guard Holland “Fennis” Neal to ei-
ther kick the ballbackoutto Spurbeck
or Hamilton at the wings or to drive
LO the hoop, something Neal has
done quite well the last two years.
‘ lfboth these options fail, Lhereis a
third option. Center Chris Jacobsen,
6»foot»9, hit enough turnaround
jumpers and grabbed enough offen-
§lVe boards last season to earn sec-
ond team all-conference honors as a
ﬁeshman. Junior George “Du it all"
Mclimsey returns for a third yw of
c‘rowd-pleasing dunks and versatile
offensetoroundoutthestarting ﬁve.
p Everyone knows though, that of-
fense is only half the show. Defen-
s‘tvely, the Pioneers will have to
hustle and out-pace their opponents
as theirlack ofheight and bulkplace
them at a natural disadvantage.
‘ Arsenault stresses getting back on

defense and controlling the boards.
The quickness of the guards, espe-
cially Neal and Wendell Barber,
should create lots of opportunities
for transition baskets and Shaan
Hamilton should once again exhibit
the defensive force which earned
him the team’s top defensive player
award last year. ,

J acobsen is a talented shot blocker
and Whipple has consistently played
outstanding post defense, George
Mchmsey and Mike Spurbeck are
also tenacious defenders, but as
MeJimsey said, “We will have to
play tough D, especially inside ifwe
want to be in a position to win.”

Grinnellians got their ﬁrst chance
to see the revamped Pioneers in ac-
tion last Saturday nightat the second
annual Red-White scrimmage. There
were bright spots: Barber’s superb
defense, Spurbcck's trifeelas, and
Whipple‘s aggressive high post
drives.

And then there were the not-so-
bright spots: the lack of screening.
some confusion in running the of-
fense. and the inability to punch the
ball inside to Jacobsen. However,
such ragged edges can be attributed
to the inevitable adjustment to a new
system. new faces and general first-
game jitters.

Although Coach Arsenault said
he was “a little disappointed" in his
team‘s performance he was quick to

“the best they’ve had yet" and ex-
pressed his admiration of the play-
ers’ ability to regroup and move
forward.

The atmosphere around the men‘s
basketball program this year is posi-
tive. Under a coach that emphasizes
fun,a style of play that every basket-
ballplayerdreamsaboutandagroup
of players that just loves to hoop, one
cannot help being optimistic about
the team's coming season.

"As long as the players play to
their potential, we will have a sue»
cessfulseasonJegardlessoflhewom
lost record," Arsenault Said.

The season tip-off is tomorrow,
Saturday, Nov. 18, at 7:30 pm. in
Darby Gymnasium.

 

Women’s Basketball Team
Hosts Tip-Oﬂ' Tournament

Grinnell basketball fans will get
their {111 of the game tod‘ay and
tomorrow when the women’s bas-
ketball team hosts its second annual
tiproff tournament.

Wartburg wrll square off with
Edgewood at 6 pm. in Darby Gym
tonight and Grinnell meets Central
at 8 p.m.. The losers play tomorrow
at 2 pm, with the championship
game at 4 pm.

Coach Ted Eskildsen projects
Warthurg as the tournament favor-
ite, noting that the Knights were
nationally ranked last season. Wartr
burg is led by 6-foot-2 center Kathy
Smith and outside shooter Kim
Sheda.

Size,expcrience,youth,and depth
are positive qualities of the Grinnell
women's basketball team for the
198990 season. Last year, the Pio-
neers posted their first winning sea-
son with a 1478 record overall and a
so conference mark.

The heart of the lineup comes in
senior captains Laura VanSickle,
6’2" center. and Amy Johnson, 5’8"
forwardt Last season, VanSickle
averaged 24.6 points and 12.6 re-
bounds per game, which earned her
Academic All-American honorsand
a spot on the Kodakall-region team.
Johnson averaged 6 points and 2
assists per game.

A quintet of sophomores brings a
wealth of experiencetotheprogram.
Forwards Julie Kaster, Suellen
Hageman. and Leigh Ashley should
take some pressure off VanSickle
and Johnson. Guards Jen Kern and
Jenny Wood will pick up where
Jessica Toft, who graduated last year,
left off.
