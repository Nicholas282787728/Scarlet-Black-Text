Giving It to You
Straight

Last spring a female student, Melanie Cooley, sparked a
wave of protest here when she asked pemtission to live off
campus during her sophomore year with her lesbian lover, and
the college turned her down.

In October, in the wake of those protests, the administra»
tion created a task force on lesbian and gay concerns at the
college — a task force with only two openly gay or lesbian
students out of 18 members. The task force mocks the efforts
of the lesbian, gay and bisexual students who struggled last
spring to win the college’srecognition for their loving partner-
ships.

The housing dispute last spring was a gay, lesbian and
bisexual student issuer Itwas a lesbian studentwho sparked the
controversy, it was gay, lesbian and bisexual students who
organized the protests and even now it is gay, lesbian and
bisexual students who are keeping the struggle for gay rights
at Grinnell going.

So then how could it be that of the seven student members
of the gay and lesbian task force, only two are gay or lesbian?
How could it be that on atask forceon gay and lesbian concerns
— a task force surely sparked by students 7 gay and lesbian
students have such a small voice?

College ofﬁcials may reply that they appointed students to
the task force without regard to sexuality, and that they don’t
know who the gay students are. Then they should have asked.
A simple note in the weekly campus memo, advertising the
creation of the task force and asking for gays, lesbians and
bisexuals to serve on it, would have done the trick.

College ofﬁcials may reply that for the task force to
educate the campus, it must itself mirror the campus commu-
nity. But one cannot speak honestly of gay and lesbian con-
cerns with a straight voice.

College ofﬁcials may reply that the task force should rep,

, resent the student body as a whole. But the straight majority
doesn’t need representation. They are already well enough
represented in the college administration It is the gay, lesbian
and bisexual students who need a voice. And they have been
denied it.

Life Is Not a Cartoon; Killing Is No Joke

 

To the Editor:

I am responding to Mike Kent's
letter on freedom of speech at Grinr
nell (Oct. 27) and the willingness of
students to listen to opinions diver»
gent from their own.

For the past year, Mike Kent‘s
column has appeared regularly and
has been read and subsequently
praised. dismissed and criticized
probably more than any other
writers

Second, where was Mike Kent at
last Tuesday night’s discussion on
US. security policy that was led by
members of the Army War College
public relations panel? For almost
three hours, students and panel

members traded ideas and beliefs in‘

a constructive and respectful atmos~
phere,Afonrm suchaslastTuesday’s
should be commended and encour»
aged because free discussion and
circulation of ideas are the basis for
this country’s constitution.

Threats to “non-lethally blow up"
people who are expressing opinions
and ideas only serve to intimidate
and have no place on this campus or
elsewhere. Perhaps Mike Kent 7
along with Judicial Council? 7 is
the product of a generation that has

viewed too much violence in care
toons and thus does not realize that
the killing that is “humorous” and
role-modeled in cartoons is final
when applied to human beings,

Open Up Judicial Council Hearings
And Let Us See Justice in Action

 

To the Editor:

Sunday night I proceeded to the
Forum to attend theludicial Council
hearing of Mike Kent.

To my dismay, I learned that J udi-
cial Council had deemed it neces»
sary, for reasons not given, to close
the hearing to the public.

I find this action to be very repre-
hensible. His hearing focuses on an
issue that concerns us all: freedom
of speech. Although Judicial Coun-

cil reserves the right to close a heat»
ing, that is in my opinion a restric-
tion of all our rights to know what is
going on at our college. Their deci»
sion may be one that will have a
lasting effect on every student atthis
college. ’

Regardless of who is right in this
case. it is our right to know not only
the final decision, but how Judicial
Council arrived at it.

Disband the Lesbian and Gay Task Force

 

To the Editor:

I am responding to the announce-
mentin last week's Scarlet andBlack
of the appointees m the college's
task force on lesbian and gay con-
cems.

Due to thespecial status of the task
force. President George Drake, with
theassistance of Strident Affairs staff
members Steven Jones, Tom Crady
and Dave Clark, was to be respon—
sible for all appointments to the task
force.

Upon learning of this selection
process, I assumed that President
Drake would be sure to consult per-
sons and institutions who were
familiar with the campus‘ lesbian
and gay community for suggestions
and nominations. I took the time to
speak with at least one Student Af-
fairs staff pcrson about my concern
that lesbian and gay students be
contacted and involved,

Several weeks later, the task force
is formed. I hadtoread about itin the
S and B.

Nobody consulted the Grinnell
Lesbian and Gay Alliance. Nobody
made any attempt to publicize the

As planned, the building would rise

Instead, lists of appropriate names

the old crony network of Student Af-

only two are openly lesbian or gay.

This is unacceptable for several
