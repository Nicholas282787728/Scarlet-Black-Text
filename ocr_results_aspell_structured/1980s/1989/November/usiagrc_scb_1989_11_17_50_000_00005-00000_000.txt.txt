Beckett’s Trashcan Hell

By Carl Thelin
and John Paul Schmit

What do a ﬂea. a gaff, a sexless
dog, two trashcans and a thick blan-
ket of existential despair have in
common'.7 They all start with the
letter “c"? No! They‘re all part of a
gambit intended to overwhelm any

painted in a fine existential grey, not
unlike the color of pristine snow

mixed with volcanic ash. Two win- ‘

dows through which only the vagu~
est hint of light enhance the aura of

despair. The costumin gand thelighs ‘

are in sync with the tone of the set.

audience that happens to be watch»
ingSamuelBeckett'sErtdgame.And
the opening night of the theater
deparment’s current production of
this play certainly overwhelmed us.

Everything about this production
is well done. The first thing you
notice about it is the set, is its awer
sameness — and we do not mean
this in the Southern California sense
of the word. The towering walls are

relationships, the end ofillusion, the
end ofthe whole world." The play's
title refers to “the logical rather than

the actual finale of a chess '

game..,tleath’s final checkmate is
inevitable.”

The action revolves around the
final throes of the conflicts which
have come to define the lives of the
four characters in the play. These
conﬂicts, both intemal (in the cases
of Clov and Hamm) and external
(Clov vs. Hamm, Hamm vs. Nagg
and Nagg vs. Nell) are for Beckett
paradigmatic of the conflicts which
envelop human existence. If all of
this seems somewhat heavy and
depressing, take heart, as the absurv

Aiming for the Big Time

By Craig Hooper

Last weekend, Grinnell’s improv
comedy group, Proteus, gave its first
offrcampus performance to an ape
preciative local crowd. Proteus. a
group of 12 uninhibited students.
played before alocal audience at the
Grinnell Community Center.

The ensemble plied its craft dur~
ing inten'nissions between the plays
‘The Quiet Place," “Faith, Hope,
and Cyanide," and “MASH” * a
series of one-act plays that were
presented by studens from the high
school. The audience received the
group very well, roaring with ap»
proval during a cunain calli

Proteus member Torn Young, a
seniorandteacheratthehigh school,
was surrounded by his incredulous
students after the Community Cen-
ter gig. The high-schoolers were
unanimous in giving Proteus a
thumbs-up. The group has even been
asked to help coach high school
students on the basics of improv.

The group is preparing for further
performances on and off-campus
They will be performing for the
public in the James Hall lounge this
Sunday night at 9:30, and will also
perform during Waste Awareness
week,

Proteus has a lot of momentum
going into these shows, after last
weekendand a very successful Norris
Hall study break “I laughed so hard
that my ribs cracked," said Eddie
Nginilla. “l was on the floor laugh-
ing most of the time."

Proteus, which traditionally per:
fonnsoncampusforhallstudybreaks
and for special events, is ready for
fame. The group is trying to land
amateur nights at comedy clubs

throughout the Midwest. The en-
semble's dream is to perform at the
legendary Second City nightclub in
Chicago, which presents a regular
diet of improvisational eomcdyx

Rob Sparks, one of the group’s
organizational geniuses, said Pro-
lens “has never had an off-campus
performance before now,1-lopefully,
we will even be able to do perform-
ances outside the greater Grinnell
area soon." Rob also wishes to in-
corporate written material into fu-
ture performances The group did
have to change their performance
material from the usual college fare
to more watered down version for
the audienceof high school students
and parents.

Proteus encourages freshness.
“Don’tthink,justreact,”sastoung,
a seasoned member of the group.
“Don't get up there and purposely
try to be funny,” he tells less-experi»
enced members.

This year, Proteus is, in Young’s
words, “a very tight group.” The
group is built around a nucleus of
returning seniors and juniors who,
as Young said, have “been doing it
since they got here," The poise, style
and humor that the more experi-
enced members exude more than
covers any of the less experienced
players and their jitters.

There are many reasons why
people consistently take part in this
“silly group of people who do silly
things,“ as senior Karen Sedestrom
described the group.

“Proteus has become an important
creativeoutlettorme,Ithink,”Bran-
dan McClain said. “It‘s just a great
place to do all those things that you
always feel like doing, but wouldn’t
normally think of doing in public:

 

Left to right are Zabrae Valentine, Michael Barr, Todd Grifﬁn and
Corrie Zoll in a scene from Endgame.

 

dist presentation of these themes is
at times very funny.

The cast does a superb job, par-
ticularly at manifesting the tension
and intricate conﬂicts between the
characters. Todd Griffin, who pro-
vides the sole movement in theplay.
does an excellent job of capturing
the physical aspects of the character
Clov.CorrieZoll,whoplaysHamm,

uses his formidable vocal skills to
great effect. Mike Barr and Zabrae
Valentine, in addition to portraying
the ageoftheir characters very well,
deserve honorable mention for en-
during two hours of garbagercan hell.

On a scale of one to a vast number
of forgotten “steps” this play re-
ceives pretty close to the full amount
possible,

Mozart Mass Warms Herrick

By Kerry Mar‘r

Applause welcomed conductor
John Stuhr-Rommereim as he one
tered a full-capacity Herrick Chapel
Sunday aftemooni He stood in front
of 130 members of the choir and
orchestra, with baton in hand, and
Mozart’s Grand Mass in C Minor on
the music stand before him

The downbeat motioned by the
director’s dictating handinterrupted
the serenity of the chapel, where
even thosestandingin therearlooked
up in attention. Even from the far»
thest pew, one could sense the in-
credibleconcentrationwrittenacross
their glowing faces of the choir
members, With full devotion to the
director's captivating lead, the so—
pranos began the gradual melodic
climb which,.when strengthened by
the persistent lower voices, grew in
such ﬁerce intensity that the plead
“Kyrie eleison”~Lord have mercy
— rang throughout the chapel well
after the last note.

Words professed the glory of God;

Violas and cellos played along the
musical line of the violins, and en
during chords challenged the measr
ures of seemingly'inten'ninable scale
runs. Soprano soloists Jean
McDonald and Kristie Tigges held

for the Lamb of God.

And as the audience filed out of
the chapel, the director collected his
music, the choir dispersed and the
orchestra members put away their
instruments, the grandeur of
Mozart’sMassvanished,and silence
was once again.
