Altered. States: Rare, Sublime Force

By Jennifer Mattes

When Ken Russell, England’s
most delightful and irreverent direc-
tor, decided to adapt a Paddy
Chayefsky novel to the screen, a
very tumultuous collaboration en-
sued. The ﬁnal product was Altered
States. a movieofrare, sublime force,
and perhaps Russell‘s best work to
date.

William Hurt, in the role that es-
tablished his cerebral ﬁlm persona,
is suspended in a tank of water in the
opening shotofthe ﬁlm. Heisan Ivy
League research scientist obsessed
with the notion of humanlcind's ori—
gins, and he accordingly subjects
himself to sustained douses in a
sensory deprivation tank in order to
achieve a psychological state of
regression.

Initially, not a whole lot happens.
.3 Hurt tries to escalate the process
by experimenting with psychedelic
mushrooms during an Indian cere-
mony in South America.

It works. His subsequent halluci-
nations, both at the ceremony and
back at his research lab, become
progressively more bizarre. The
uanslation of these subjective Exper
riences to the screen by Russell is
technically astounding. They are of
a horrendous experiential nature,
packed with glaring psychedelia and
visually loaded symbolism. Pauline
Kael, in her bitter, deprivedras-a»
child way ofreviewing films,called
them “choppy slide shows.“ In fact
they are wonderfully executed and
constitute the heart of the film.

One particularly weird sequence
features garish images of Jesus'
resurrection, and at one point l-lurt

envisions himself within a bizarre
setof Salvador Dali-type landscapes.

However, as Hurt obsessively
hurtles himself down the evolution-
ary ladder, he pays aheavy price for
hiscuriosity,Hispsychologicalstates
begintohavephysicalrepercussions.
Indeed, by the ﬁlm‘s cathartic cli-
max.thescientistiscompletelytrans-
figured into a white hot mass of
energy. a state of pre-human chaos.

The ﬁlm’s position is ultimately
anti-science. Hurt’s obsessive sci-
entiﬁc method, his need for an ulti-
mate solution to existence, leads only

to mayhem and no clear answers.
Only by a savage force of will and
the redemptive powers of love is he
able to wrench himself back to
humanity.

Ken Russell, when recently asked
why he continues to make ﬁlms in
the face of such spiteful critical re-
ception, replied that he had to,
“because everything else out there is
juSt so dead.”

Altered States is a testament to his
vision as adirector. It is one of those
rare films that enliven the viewer.

Bring Your Own No—Doz

By John Paul Schmit
and Carl Thelin

Cinematography is a great art form,
and Out ofA/rt'ca is an example of
cinematography at its best. Imagine
sweepingpanorarnic shotsofbreath—
taking African scenery. Envision
dramatic footage of assorted sub-
Saharan ﬂora and fauna gallivanting
across thescrecn. See the duck-billed
wildebeastl See the rabbit-cared
baobab tree! See the wild kata—
murunbi! See ifyou can stay awake!

The plotof this somnambular film
deals with the conflicts that arise
when a European imperialist hour»
geois Meryl Streep is dragged off to
Africa by her irresponsible patriar-
chal husband in order to exploit the
masses on some farm while he de-
stroys the wildlife. At this point in
the ﬁlm, Carl falls asleep.

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the
dashing young pilot (Robert Redford
— how many Robert Redford move
ies have there been on campus re-
cently?) wins Meryl’s imperialist
bourgeois heart and then leaves her,
like the scum thatall men are. On top
of this, various farm troubles arise
becauseMeryldocsn’thavethe faintr
est idea what she‘s doing runntng a
farm. At this point, John Paul falls
asleep.

According to reliable sources,
Robert continues to come and go,
like the scum that all men are, and
things continue to go wrong on the
farm, and Meryl suffers nobly, thus
winning the respect ofother charac-
ters in the film and any audience
members who are still awake.

Apparently , at some point, the ﬁlm
ends.

We were unsure whether to rec»
ommend this ﬁlm to people who

both extremely beautiful and aston-
ishingly dull.

Butnever fear, we came up with a
compromise which we call the Out

the ﬁlm is being shown. We advise
that you take some refreshments,

be able to see the beautiful cinema-

If you should happen to see some
especially breathtaking, awe-inspir-
ing or imperialist bourgeois scen-
ery, you can pretend you‘reon a real
safari and take a picture of it, (We
recommend that you don‘t use the
flash).

Any particularly fine photos can
besubmitted to the arts editorofThe
Scarlet and Black, campus box T-l.
Once all the photos are in, a distinr
guishedpancl ofjudges willpickthc
winner from among the entries. The
winner may appear in a future issue
of The Scarlet and Black, and will
also win some piddling little prize
which is yet to be determined.

On a scale ofone to 30 tsets: ﬂies,
this film rates a five if you don’t use
No-Doz, and a six if you do.

Of Mind and Matter

By Andrew Hamilton

Conjurlng up images of gothic
monsters and mystical powers, the
“ﬂat stuff on walls” in the Forum
gallery is an engrossing trip through
surreal fantasy, symbolism and
expression.Theexhibit,“Asu'onomy
Domino: A Joint Venture.” will be
up through Nov, 24.

Steve Medrick and Matt Rogers
have combined their work to pro;
duce this intriguing show. The ex-
hibit is made up of still lifes (includ—
ing a revealing portrait of me “Nol-
len House Porch Planter"), fantasyv
occult designs and collages.

Rogers' pieces reﬂect his fascinar
tion with the occult. A particularly
fascinating scriesisRogers’ study of
tarotcards. He has produced a set of
22 cards in pen, as well as a series of
trump cards done in watercolor.

Some of Rogers’ larger works
appear to reflect the inﬂuence of
William Blake. The ﬂowing, almost
amorphous human figures in “The
Lovers" and “Nuit” are reminiscent
of Blake's style.

But most of Rogers‘ pieces refuse
to pity homage to any particular one
ism“! don'tconsciously follow any
artist,“ Rogers said.

Also of great interest are Rogers‘
collages. These assemblages of
newspaper clippings are captivating
in an artistic, as well as u socior
political sense, He said the collages
“all turned into social commentary
becauselhave to workwith thingsin
print."

Rogers says much of his work
begins with an abstract premise and
only later evolves into a concrete
image. In some of the pieces, it is
only after the abstractions havebcen
dealtwith that Rogers may begin to
take into account purely artistic
considerations such as color and
balance. This method seems to work
quite successfully. Rogers’ pieces

Dramatic Reading:

A rehearsed reading ofBorrt [It the
R.S,A.,amodemSouthAfricanplay,
will be given by freshman tutorial
students on Monday, Nov. 20, at 8
pm. in Roberts Theater.

The class, “Theater in Modern
South Africa,” is taught by James
Taylor, associate theater professor.

are intricately symbolic, as well as
artistically appealing.

Steve Medrick's pieces lend to be
more surrealistic. In many of his
works, Medrick makes effective use
of bright tempera paints to express
the fantastic images he conjures up.
Medrick says he looks to Salvador
Dali and other surrealism for inspira-
tion. But, he explains, most of his
works come “straight from my
mind."

The success of the combination of
Medrick's imagination and his style
is evident in such pieces as theevoca-
tive“OncEveningAfterWork."This
surreal piece goes a fair distance in
examining thecloaked imagesof the
subconscious mind.

Medrick gives a more substantial
form to some of his other piecm.
such as “Consciousness: R3.” Here,
Medrick has given his musings a
concrete, futuristic form. His intrir
cate portrayals of future lands and
cities are fascinating.

One of Medrick’s works, “Fan—
tasy/Sci Fl" portrays a city and its
reverse underneath it. The piece is
remarkable for the ideas which it
conveys;athousand storiesmightbc
told of those two cities. In fact the
painting is so reminiscent of Italo
Calvino'sdeseription ofthefictional
city of Eusapia in Invisible Cities.
that one might imagine Medrick’s
piece appearing in Calvino’s book.

Also of interest is the far wall of
the gallery, on which the artists have
hung some of their unworked
sketches. While this is. as Medrick
and Rogers explained, their work in
its “freer forms," it is nevertheless
interesting and revealing. It is here
that the abstract image first meets
with hard lines and a plane ofpaper.
The results of this merging ofideas
with the physical world can reveal
much of the human mind.

And,as the two artists pointout, it
can also be ”fun to look at."
