Students, faculty and adminis—
trators gathered Wednesday at an
open forum’ in South Lounge to
address multiculturalism at Grin-
nell. Minority faculty and student
recruitment were discussed, as
were the inclusion of a multicul-
tural perspective in the curricu»
lum and Grinnell’s responsibility
to give its studentsa culturally di-
verse education. .

The open forum, which drew 30
to 50 students and faculty mem-
bers, was prompted by a proposal
in October by the Student Organi-
zation for Latinos andLatinas that

“We must continue to make abor»

all women,” he said.

Forum Targets Lack of Diversity

In responsetodemands that Grin-
nell step up its efforts to recruit
multicultural students, President
Drake said that historically Grin-
nell devoted the most energy to at-
tracting black students but the col-
lege is now moving to draw stu—
dents of Asian»American and His-
panic heritages.

“Up until this current year we
haven’t made the commitment to
go all out in this area,” Drake said.
“We’re getting to the point where
we’re ready to do that.“

Jodi Hester, coordinator of mi-
nority admission, said that in addi-
tion to mailings. high school visi-
tations and other standard recruit-
ing tactics, the office of admission

Police took fingerprints

burglars in a student’s room.

 

 

 

“Once we can get these '
subjects and try and pin them
down and get some finger-

maybe we can come up with a

People matching the descriptions
of the burglars have also been seen
on campus since the robberies.
