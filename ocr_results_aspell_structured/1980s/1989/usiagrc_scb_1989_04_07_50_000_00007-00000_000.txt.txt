used cultural advantages such as
slron g work ethics to tunl their na-
tions into manufacturing or indus
trial powerhouses, Although such
practicemay be profitable, and even
seemingly sustainable (in the case
of industry), it leads to dependence
on other“supply” nations. Further»
tnore, political and economic free

national relationship breaks up, the
dependent nation can stirrer from
food shortages and loss of markets.

Therefore, Hyams' statement
makes sense. If we interpret “sal-
\lttlion" as Iongvterm sustainability,
then Hyams is telling us that a Mr
lion mustbeclose to the land (grow-
ing its own food) to be successful
overtime. Ifa society is selfasuffi»

that cultured normal human and
animal cells have a limited
capacity for replication. This
discovery, known as the Hayflick
Limit, focused attention on the
cell as the fundamenml location
ofagc changes.

Daniel Callahan will explore
the ethical issues surrounding
aging in a Scholars’ Convocation
lecture entitled “Rationing Health
Care: Can We Live With Our
Mortality?” at 11:00 a.m.
Thursday, April I3, in Herrick
Chapel. Callahan is eo-founder
and director of The Hastings
Center, a New York-based

' research and educational
organization established in 1969
to examine ethical issues of
medicine, biology, and the

. professions. He is the author or

ing food at home, as long as thcclr
mate allows it (which is true in al-
most all countries), means less
transportation, less use of pesti-
cides and fertilizers designed for
non-indigenous systems, and ex-
tensive useofinformationand labor
resources already present in the
area.

But the present agricultural sys-
tems in the world are often far froln
being self-sufficient. As an over-
prosperous nation whose lifestyle
is dependent on many of the re-
sources of the Third World. the
United States in turn uses masses
of funds to help in international
development. If this nation wants
to try to improve conditions at a
global level instead of just within
the country, itneeds to (we need to)
try to use financial and human re
sources to develop sustainability,
which will be much more benefi-
cial in the long run for hutnans and
the rest of the environment.

“Setting Limits: Medical Goals
in an Aging Society," “Abortion:
Law, Choice, and Morality." and
“Abortion: Understanding Differr

on a book about the allocation of
heatheare resources.

The symposium will conclude
with a panel discussion at 7:30
pm. on Thursday. April I3, in

and Callahan as panelists are

Women's group

< where women are teaming about
_thclnsclves and feminism at
different levels.
‘ This semester, Women‘s
'SUPPOH Group is functioning
more as a sanctuary for wotncn.
(The last paragraph of the new
‘pllilosophy reads, “Women's
Support Group provides a
‘rcsource of wotnen for women.
‘ We gather together to share and to
support one another. We provide
‘a sense of security for ourselves
‘which otherwise is not provided
by the college community.”
Instead of educating both men and
women as old philosophies have
previously clmmeri, the members
’ of women’s group have decided to

-excludc men in order to focus on .

women. For several members,
'the task of being both educator
and supporter conﬂicted.

Derek puts the issue
metaphorically, “It was like an
111]“er doctor trying to heal
others. She needs to heal herself
first.” Once the members feel the
healing powers of support, tlte
education about women’s issues
for men and women will become
regular practice.

We'll Keep You Posted

With the SGA elections over,
the SGA office has started to settle
back down to normal business. I
would like to thank the Election
Board and volunteers who ran the
election this year. I have gotten
used to the ”Lame Duck” jokes by
this time also. So, what is the nor-
mal business of SGA right now?
To start, we postponed the trip to
Hell in the newly purchased laun~
dry carts now available to OCCO
houses, but of course

conferences thattakeplaecoffcamr
pus, For whatever reasons. stu-
dents have recently been going to
more national conferences. These
students must go around to the
various funding bodies on campus
to get money for registration fees,
travel, and food. Conﬂicts arise
when Mr. Drake does not know if

field program finds the conference

worthwhile. To increase

 

the tickets ”will be here

Drake will be pooling
some of his discretion-

 

 

the SGA Cabinet is
working on three big projects and
several small ones at this point.
First, the Cabinet has scheduled a
meeting with Student Affairs and
the college lawyer to discuss the
college’sliabilityforpartiesinvolv-
ing alcohol. Afterthismeeting, we
will try to formulate some sort of
understandingwithStudentAffairs
aboutdistribution in the new I-larris
Center and the dorms fornext year.
The Cabinet, Student Affairs, and I
hope you agree it is better to re»
search and negotiate this issue be
fore the building is put up to avoid
conﬂicts due to a lack ofcomtnunir
cation over the summer.
Second,theCltbtnet is setting up

and this money will be approprir
ated by the SGA FinanceCommit—
tee. Hopefully, this idea will pro-
vide more opportunity for student
trips and set up some consrstent
form of evaluation so first-come.
first-serve doesn’t entirely dictate
who gets money.

include a review of the I-IRC/GRC

in the bathrooms, enrollment and
housing issues, the phone-user fee
being paid at the beginning of the
year instead of after winter break,
review of Dining Services, one-
year evaluation of the Concerts and
Films program, and the open fo-

Lesbian and Gay Pride Week
will be April 9-15. Check that
obnoxious glossy calendar. None
of us learn by osmosis, not even
chemistry majors, so take some
time to look up and see what your
fellowstudentsareworkingsohard
to bring to you.

As always, myjob is easier with
your suggestions. Please come in
to talk if you have questions or
comments. My father would say
that often SGA is like wetting
yourself in a dark suit—you get a
warm feeling but no one nodccs.
Luckily my father IS seeking pro-
fessional help. Once again. we’ll
keep you posted.
