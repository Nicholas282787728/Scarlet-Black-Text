in societal expectations of women.

Five of them. Kate Quinn (Laura

Cohen) and Rita Altabel (Jennifer
Mattcm) meet at a restaurant six
years after graduation. They are all
still trying to be the “uncommon
women" they were in college, even
though their lives have gone in dif-
ferent directions, and even though
they are all afraid that they are not
living up to the ideals they nurtured
when they all struggled together.
The play then shifts back to 1972,
when the women were seniors in
college, and follows them through
their final year. Three other class
mates and their housemother are
introduced, completing the picture
of college life.

 

The play ends with the five unr The cast of “Uncommon Women,“ shown here in rehearsal. Left to right are Laura Moran. Judy Cohen,

E.M. Forster’s Excellent Adventure

By Andrew Hamilton

A misbooked hotel room is, per
haps, commonplace. But oh, what
unforeseen trouble one may wander
into when one accepts aroom with a
view from strangers.

Based on EM. Forster’s brilliant
1923 novel of the same name, the

The beauty of
Florence is only one
of a series of
remarkable Italian
and English settings
for F orster’s tale.

ﬁlm A Roam With A View is an
enjoyable portrait of a slice of 19th
century England and the volatile
effect it has when it comes into
contact with the impulsive atrnos
phere of Italy.

The film is captivating from the
very start, when we metLucyHoney-
church, a young English woman of
the proper son, who is on a trip to
Italy with her dour aunt Charlotte.
The differences between England
and Italy soon become apparent, as
do differences of class, life philoso»
phy and perhaps most striking, the
difference between how Lucy
Honeychurch lives her life, and how
she might like to live it

The beauty of Florence is only one
ofa series of remarkable Italian and
English settings for Forster's tale.
Each setting is beautifully filmed,
and accurate to the book.

The film does arnplejustice to the

The portrayal of class differences

with a growing self-awareness, and
an increasing tendency to step out-

and expected.
