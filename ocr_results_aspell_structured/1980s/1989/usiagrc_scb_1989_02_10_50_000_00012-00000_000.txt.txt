Pioneers nip .I.C. 66-65 in remarkable finish

by Bob Liflon
Holy cow. what a gamcl

Without a doubt, the ﬁnest finish
to a Pioneer men‘s basketball
game in the last four years.

Saturday aftemoon’s thrilling
66~65 victory over Illinois
College was a sight to behold.
This amazing win. coming
afteriyes, after~time had
expired, sent a buzzing feeling
throughout Darby. The crowd
was completely awestruck by
what unfolded before their eyes.

Despite being sandwiched be
tween Friday’s 87-81 loss to
Knox and Tuesday’s 82v66 defeat
at the hands of Monmouth, the
Illinois College game maintained
its magic. It provided one of
those rare moments—those
indescribable instants, when
goosebumps miraculously ap
pear, sending a shivering
sensation up your spincillml
should be somehow suspended in
time.

THE GAME. which
incidently gave the Pioneers (3-
14) their first conference win.
belonged to Illinois College in
the beginning. Hitting virtually
everything they threw up, the
Blueboys (come on, now how do
they expect to win with a goofy
nickname like that?) went on a
10»point tear, going up 21»ll
with 7:25 10 play in the opening
half. -

Slowly but surely, the
Pioneers inched their way back.
As the half were to a close, they

Hoopsters

were down only five. 33-28.

The second half proved to be
a low—scoring affair as well.
After coming close on several

occasions, Grinnell broke' in front
44- 43 on a pair of Mike
Spurbeck free throws with 10
minutes left in the game. A
Steve Howland threcrpoinlcr (he
had 18 on the afternoon) 60
seconds later put the Pioneers up
by a deuce, 4947. From here on
in. the two teams swapped the
lead virtually every trip down the
ﬂoor.

With 1:19 left to play, Dave
Chamberlain canned a trifecta to
tie it at 63. The Blueboys
stormed right back. going ahead
by a bucket with :40 remaining.

The Pioneers committed what
appeared to be a game-costing
turnover with :15 left. A
subsequent Pioneer foul which
put LC. on the line brought the
“inevitable“ oh-so-closer. All the
Blueboys needed to do was
conven on their free throws to ice
the game. The fans. sensing this
ominous ending, began gathering
their belongings.

This day, however, belonged
to the Pioneers. Gathering the
rebound off the missed front end
of the one and one, Grinnell had a
chance to tie the game with only
seven ticks left on the clock.

regain winning edge

The Pioneer women‘s
basketball squad continued to
struggle this week as they
extended their losing streak to six
games with losses to Illinois
College and Coo.

Remembering those days, not
too long ago. when this team
racked up wins like never before
and appeared to be on the road to
conference glory. makes this
streak all lhe more painful. Yet
it is difficult to win when. as
assistant coach Andy Hamilton
puts it, “You don‘t have all your

Regaining that consistent. or

as some might put it. relentless
attack, which the Pioneers
demonstrated last semester, will
be imperative to success in the
ﬁnal weeks of the season.

When Illinois College

them with some sound. no-

win you had better be prepared to
battle. The Lady Blues were up

their last-ditch effort. Chris
Jacobsen‘s (18 points) softy
jumper in the paint fell through
as time expired. Tied at 65. And
then the real fun began.

Illinois College wisely

Jacobson buried the tying hoop.
As it turned out, it was a rather
unwise decision, to say the least.
since LC. had no timeouts left
to call, thereby resulting in a
technical foul.

Thus with no time on the
clock, Spurbeck went to the line
to shoot the technical. Nothing
but net. Grinnell wins by one!

The entire Pioneer team
rushed onto the floor as if they
had just won the national
championship. It was complete
mayhem. Even Coach Westlund
got caught up in the jubilation.

Track team cruises into season
loaded with bright prospects

by Luc Hatleslad

Saturday will mark the
beginning of formal competition
for the men’s indoor-track team
as captains Benn Tannenbaum
and Scott Hamilton lead them
into competition at Cornell
against the Southern Division
teams of the Midwest
Conference. Last Saturday’s
home meet was a practice match
of sorts, since only Grand View
College was present to compete
with the men. while the women
ran against themselves.

Coach Will Freeman is
putting little emphasis on the
early meets other than as tools
for conditioning his team. Said

 

Mao‘-

Freeman. “We are not worried
about the early meets. We use
them as a way to Lrain and try out
different combinations in order to
be able to field our most
competitive team at the
conference meet."

Injuries have not been a
major problem for the Pioneers
thus far, although Matt Schmger
and Jason Maples did not run
Saturday and Gay Potter will not
be available for about two weeks.
Shragcr is expected to be one of
Freeman's top sprinters. Potter
won last year's Drake Relays
half-mile event as a high-school
senior.

The Pioneers’ strong distance
lineup features Greg Evans, who
won the 10007melcr eventand the
mile run last year. and twormile
winner David Hammond. Pat
Heller and Jonathon Lave are also
expected to fortify the team’s
two-mile roster. Shrager and
Dominador Gobaleza are currently
regarded as the top sprinting
prospects.

In the ﬁeld events, the pole
vault features Lee Kraemcr and

Kirk Marty. while Mark
Ruckdaeshel and Kevin Tapp are
considered top prospects in the
high jump. These hopefuls ex»
cmplify the Pioneers‘ balance of
experience and young talent, as
only Evans, Marty, Gobaleza,
and Lave are upperclassmen.

Expected to pace the women's
team are high jumpers Abby
Green. Karen Drinkwater, and
Carol Peterson. The Pioneers
also look strong in the sprinting
department. Kate Peterson and
Manali Barua will run the short .
distances, while Joanne Sackett
and Ann Hollistcr carry the load
in the longer stretches. Their
season opens tomorrow at
Cornell.
