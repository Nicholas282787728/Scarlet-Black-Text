The grapes of wine

by Jeff Phelps

The Riesling or Johannesberg
Riesling grape, as it is more
commonly known, is the best of
the vinifcra grapes (”Fine write"
grapes come froth the “Vinifera”
family as opposed to the
“Labursca” family, which is made
up primarily of table grapes suclt
as concords and lambrusces)
native to Germany. This grape is
responsible for tile bcst wines
from the Mosol and Rhine rcr
gionx, and is also used with great
success in the United States,
Australia, and titrougliout Eastern
Europe The Riesling ttsclt ts a
stnalt white-skinned grape equally
capable of producing inteiise dry
wines with low residual sugar
(the percent of natural fruit sugar
remaining at tile time of bottling)
and rich golden dessert wines of
such concentration that they
remain virtually unmatched
around the world, Perhaps the
most appealing attribute of the
grape is its smell or aroma (those
smells associated with the grape
itself rather titan the smells
associated with the wine-making
process.) When well-made,
Riesling wines have a distinct
ﬂoral aroma which reminds some
people of violets, others of
delicate perfumes. Many

domestic Rieslings also carry a
heavy dose of citrus in tlte nose
(smell) which can be quite
pleasant when the wine i\ paired
wim chicken.

Ricsititgs made iii a sweeter
style need just a hit of acidity in
order to balance them out. Sweet
wines that are poorly balanced
(i.e. low in acidity) tend to taste
flat or insipid, Sweet Ricslit‘tgs
are great served as aperitifs or as
companions for desserts such as
chocolate cake, fruit cocktails,
and apple p . Dry to i’lil‘dilinl'
sweet Rieslings go well with
fowl, seafood, shellfish, and mtld
chees . They also work well
Wllh spicy Chinese dishes and
cumcs, where they serve more as
palate cleansers than as matches
for any specific food

Remember, whenever you
purchase wine, be sure to give
plenty of information about your
requirements and what styles of
wine you like.

When you can communicate
witli the Wine steward, you have
a much better chance of being
served a wine which matches the
food as well as your tastes.

Next time, more about
ordering wine in restaurants.

SCARLET AND BLACK

On the road with Miss Feng
China welcomes visitors

by May-lee Chai

In 1979 China ceased its poly
icy of isolation and opened its
doors to the West. Whereas dur-
ittg the Cultural Revolution
(1966-76) any Contact with the
international community was
largely seen a. a sign of one’s
spiritual polluton, the Chinese
people were now told to welcome
“foreign friends” with open arms.

Perhaps some societies would
have trouble with illi, sudden
about-face; not so with China
in the past 10 years, the China
international Travel Servtce has
grown to ﬂWC~tnSpiring proporr
trons. its tctidrtls reaching into
corners anti backwaters i would
not have imagitied.

For our fall bleak, my class-
mates and i went on a group trip
to a mountain range ctillcd Wu Yt
Shall. We took it erhour train
trip from Nanjing l0 Fujitin
province, which lies on the part
of the east coast opposite the is
land of Taiwtui.

From the Lrtun station we
chartered a bus to take us to our
“guesthouse," which was more
than three hours from the nearest
town. Along with the bus, a
member of the ClTS task force
had been assigned to us as a guide
for the length of our stay.

As the bus lumbered off past

Participants will also urge
members of Congress to pass
paretttalrleavc and childcare
legislation.

Gebhard explained that the
march will emphasize the
“Continuity of the struggle" for
women's rights. Marchers will
wear white and carry banners to
recall the suffragist era. “If you
look at the history of the
feminist movement, it’s a
heartbreaking struggle," Gebhard
said, “‘Equal pay for equal work'
was a slogan in 1910, and it's
still not a reality in many fields.”

and headed up the mountain, our
guide grabbed a microphone
hooked tip to the hus’ sound sysr
tent,

“Hello, my name is Mist
Fcng. I am very very happy to
be your guide. This is itiy first
time. i itave trevct been it guide
to Aincrict s before, " she in-
fonnetl us with a broad stntle.

”i will stng you a song." she
said. Attd she did. “Now it is
your turn. Who will sing a
song?"

No one spoke. After our
nearly day-long train ride, whose
most memorable aspect was tlte
incretlibi amount of Coal dust
that had blown in through the
wtndows and onto our faces, we
were not in a Singing ittood, We
looked to our American professor
for guidance.

“This is a Chinese custom,”
he said.

We looked at each other
uncomfortably.

“Who will siiig’.7 Who will
sing?" She pomted the mike at
one of my classmates. “You can
sing us a song"

“Oh, no, I can t sing," he
said squirming. “You don t
want to hear me sing. Hey. you
sing." He slapped his roommate
on the back.

Miss Feng began to look
perturbed. “l have already sung,
Who' ts going to sing now?‘ ’

Our Chinese professor began
to explain to her that Americans
aren‘t used to this custom.

Our American professor
turned to us. “Come on, we’re
losing face, guys,” he goaded.

Finally, sottteone whistled a
few bars of the “Lollipop Gang'
from 1h: Wizard of Oz The rest
of us broke into a few mangled

through the Jews for Jesus head-
quarters in San Francisco.

Other debate centered around
the organization that Landrum
was representing. Jews for Jesus
is known for its emphasis on
converting Jews. Conversion
was a major concern for Dennis
Haas, chaplain of the college,
who recalled a previous visit by
Jews for Jesus, during which the
speaker began to encourage con
version.

“I guess I look at everything
on campus as conversion, said
Farsi He added, “Whenever ideas
are presented, there can be some
good from it " He responded to
the possibility of offending Jews
by saying, “As a Christian, my
ideas are challenged every day."
He further stated that CSCA did

from Wheaten, Ill; and Tahnee
Robertson, a biology major
from Flagstaff, Ariz.

choruses of “99 Bottles of Beer
on the Willi." Before we got past
the 96th bottle, the bus driver
decided he had suffered enough
and pumped some pic iceordcd
Chinese music through the bits
speakers.

As the bus rounded each hair-
pin curve, the mad scented to
narrow. It turned to dirt, then to
rock. Then finally in the middle
of natt here appeared a tiny reatt-
side shack surrounded by a few
leaning wooden structures. one of
which housed a pig and some
ducks. Here our bus cons
veniently “broke down."

The driver stopped and went
out to check on the situation.

“Uh Oh, the bus is hrtvktn,"
Miss Feng announced l\ itli a
smile. “Everybody must get off
so he can fix the bus. Get up!
Get off! Get off, please!"

As we stumbled off the bus, a
crowd of the villagers came to
stare at us foreigners. They
smiled at us and Miss Feng. We
were then ushered into the shack,
which just happened to be a store
selling cigarettes, cookies, and
Pep sit

“Oh, how lucky, huh?" Miss
Feng said.

After a brief interlude—which
lasted only until she noticed we
Americans were beginning to
drift off into the surrounding
countrysideiwe were told the
bus was “fixed" now and we
could go on our way.

We gathered up our purchases
and reboarded the bus, which
promptly spun off onto the rocky
path leading up the green moun-

not mean to offend students.
According to Fors, CSCA s pur»
pose is to “expose the campus to
different viewpoints about
Christianity.’

Attempting to stop the pro-
gram was not considered a proper
response by either Haas or Bell.
Both believed that Jews for Jesus
had the right to speak on campus
because they had been invited by
CSCA. “1‘ m riot into censor-
ship," said Haas “My reeling Is
that Lhis is not a good thing to do
to the community, especially in
light of Jewish Cultural Week
(which was held last week)"

Before Lite presentation, Haas
requested that solicitation materi»
als be removed from chairs tn the
room because solicitations are
against campus policy. He also
asked Landrum to limit his pre-
sentation to the stated topic,
keeping it educational, not mis-
sionistic Landrum agreed to
comply with both requests.

Lewis expressed interest in
attending a traditional Passover
celebration. Bell commented that
the Jewish Student Organization‘s
annual observance is open to all
students. However, since the
celebration centers around a_
dinner, iii ed Students Should
contact her.
