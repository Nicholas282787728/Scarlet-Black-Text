Condom Controversy Still Throbbing

 

By Diane Brumley

Controversy on the Grinnell cam-
pus has erupted again over the issue
of the condom machines in the laun-
dry rooms.

Thedebate began lastMarch, when
Consumer Reports rated Lifestyle
condoms i the brand of condoms
then stocked in Grinnell's machines
— as one of the least reliable on the
market. Student complaints conse-
quently led to the removal of con»
doms from the machines.

Since then, Donna Bailey, direcr
tor of the college Health Center, has
been searching for a suitable alterna-
tive. The hard fact that Bailey keeps
coming up against is that there
doesn’t seem to be a plausible solu-
tion.

The biggest issue to take rise thus
far is that condoms — because of
contents like nonoxynol 9, a sper-
micide,’ and lubricants — have expi-
ration dates. Manufacturers, not
wanting to sell condoms gone bad,
do not package their condoms for
sale in vending machines.

There does exist, though, a com-
pany that does individually package
condoms which may “safely” besold
in vending machines.

”FheUniversity of Iowa uses these
machines, but. Bailey said, not-
ing other problems, such as the high
cost of replacing the machines now

mounted on the walls and the very
poor quality of the condoms used by
U of I.

“Sodowewanttousean unknown
source which may not even be better
than the Lifestyles?" she asked.

Funhermore, a minimum of 25 ,000
condoms must be ordered at a time,
which would create an expense for
the school in excess of $2500.

Jennifer Krohn, associate dean of
Student Affairs, said that her main
thrust is to make sure that students
are aware of their own responsibili-
ties. With regard to the condom
machines on campus, she feels “that
it is important to weigh the institu-
tionalandindividualresponsiblilites
involved.”

In an office memorandum sent to
several faculty members and Rob
Killion, SGA president, she said,
“Part of the student educational
experience at Grinncll is leaming to
become a responsible citizen within
the community of Grinnell and the

activity.”

Killion presented theissueto Joint
Board last week, and returned to
Krohn with their ideas this past
Wednesday. Among SGA‘s pro-
posed solutions was to suggest that
Grinnellplaceasinglebulk ordcrfor
condoms in conjunction with sch
eml other Midwest schools. Other
suggestions were to distribute con-
doms through campus mail or
through student advisors and rest-
dent advisors. Results of the meet-
ing Wednesday between SGA and
Student Affairs have yet to be re-
vealed.

Although each continues to re-
searchpossibleonrcampussolutions,
Krohn, Bailey and Killion all at:-
knowledged that there are several
24-hour markets near the campus
where studean may purchase con-
doms. Bailey said that sexually ac
tive students should either “make
the effort to come to the Health
Center, or go purchase your own
supply.“Condomsarenotsoldinthe

cally, though, they offer the Life-
style condom.)

“Students should be able to plan
ahead, yes, but I’m not nearly so
quick to give up yet," Killion added.

Untilany final decisionisreached,
the machines in the laundry rooms
will remain empty.

Do students have any other ope
tions,alternatives,orchoices?“Yes,"
Bailey said, “they always have a
choice —— individual choice as to
sexual activity."

Bailey echoed Krohn's feelings in
summing up: “It’s very important
for the responsibility to lay on the
