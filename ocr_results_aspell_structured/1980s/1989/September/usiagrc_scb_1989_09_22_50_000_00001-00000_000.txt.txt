Grinnell College

Administration Is Forming Task Force
on Gay and Lesbian Issues on Campus;
May Recognize Gay Couples in Housing

By Rob Fein

College ofﬁcials say they are sen-
ously considering including gay and
lesbian couples in a proposed resi-
dence for married students. They
also say they are forming a task force
on lesbian and gay relations at Grinr
nell and are considering renovating
and expanding the Gay Resource
Center.

Their talks come in the wake of
student protests last spring over the
college’s refusal to allow a female
student to live off campus with her
lover 7 a right that was granted to
heterosexual married students.

College president George Drake
said housing for married students,
including gay couples, is being
“seriously considered."

“it is a drinkable option,” he said.

Grinnell would be adding itself to
a small but growing list of universi-
ties —— including Stanford and the
University of California at Irvinei
with housing for same-sex couples.

Drake said man-led student hous-
ing might take the form of a college-
owned house ormightbeincludedin
a new dormitory. Thomas Crady,
Dean of StudentAffairs, conﬁrmed
that the college is “considering an
option for college~owned housing
for married and same-sex couples,"
but would not elaborate on the plan.

The task force on lesbian and gay
relations will address matters of

concern to gay students, faculty and
staff and advise the administration
on gay and lesbian issues, Drake
said. The group will provide what
administrators say is a needed chan»
nel of communication.

Drake said the task force will be
“at least a dozen people” — stu-
dents, facultyand staff— with“good
student representation," and that it
should be formed by the end ,of
September. He said the college is
probably “ready to accept at least
some of the recommendations that
will come out of it. You know there
are going to be some changes."

Administrators said that in antici-
pation of the task force’s recommen-
dations. they are already talking
about renovating or expanding the
Gay Resource Center and adding to
is library.

The controversy began last Februe
ary when Melanie Cooley, then a
freshman, asked for permission to
live off campus during her sophoa
more year with her lover, Jennifer
Barbour, who is not a Grinnell stu-
dent. Her request threw college
administrators for a loop; housing
guidelines said that underclassmen
mustlive in thedormitories, with the
exception of legally man‘ied students,
who were allowed to move from the
dorms at any time.

Cooley’s request was made more
complicated by Grinnell’s non-dis-
crimination policy, which says in
part that the college does not dis-

criminate on the basis of“sexual or
affectional preference in administra-
tion ofany of its educationalpolicies
or programs.”

Cooley‘s request moved up the

chain of command, going from her -

resident advisor through the Office
of Student Affairs to college vice-
presidentWaldo Walker and to presi-
dent George Drake. But Drake held
firm: no legal marriage, no pcrrnisr
sion to move out.

The Student Government Asso-
ciation quickly came to the couple’s
defenseand voted toinclude gayand
lesbian marriages in the college’s
housing guidelines. The student
govemment passed the resolution,
“Until lowa recognizes same-sex
marriages, Grinnell College will
recognize institutionally sanctioned
marriages of same-sex couples."

President Drake refusal SGA’s
recommendationanddecidedinstead
to bring the housing rules in line
with the college‘s nondiscrimina—
tion policy with anew restriction: no
married couples — neither hetero-
sexual nor gay — would be allowed
to live off campus as underclass-
men. Only students with children
would be allowed out of the dorms
before their junior year.

The president‘s decision immedi- l
ately drew a storm of protest. In the
firslof a series of protests, about 150
students demonstrated outside Nol-
len House, which houses the presi-
dent’s ofﬁce. Drake stepped outside

ARH Renovations Running
On Schedule,Within Budget

By Diane Bnrmley

Renovation ofAlumni Recitation
Hall is right on schedule and mn-
ning “very, very smoothly," accord-
ing to college vice-president Waldo
Walker.

A 188-seat auditorium equipped
to show movies. and indoor ramps
connecting ARH and Carnegie are
two of the items in the more titan $4
million budget for the ARH renova-
tion project.

The building, under reconstruc-
tion since May, is scheduled to open
August 1, 1990.

The building's budget 7 includ-
ing consultants’ and architect’s fees
— is 154,81 1,000. But Walker esti«
mates that Grinnell will receive ap-
proximately $51,000 in state tax
refunds and some leftovers born an
$86,000 contractor’s contingency
fee.

hall with a terraced and slanted floor

armchair desks rather than purchas-
ing new furniture is also pan of the
architect’s theme.

The relocation of faculty ofﬁces
this year has been a concern. “Some
ofﬁces are inadequate, but fortu-
nately they’re only temporary,” said
Beryl Wellbom, whose office has
been moved to Goodnow Hall. “I
haven‘theard too many complaints,"
Wellbom said.

Most faculty members say they
are satisﬁed with the changes. ” Our
temporary quarters are better than
our former quarters," said Betty

Curriculum Committee Proposes
a New Senior Seminar System

By Missy Sharer

A new senior seminar program
related to the freshman tutorial sys
tent was proposed by the Curricu-
luvaeview Committee at a faculty
meeting last Monday. The commit»
tee suggested a required upper-level
seminar on a topic of the student’s
choice in a non-major area. Each
seminar would have a minimun of
three prerequisites in at least two of
the major divisions.

The committee said it hopes the
new system would “add structure to
students‘ non-major curricula." The
proposal now goes to the faculty for
discussion and approval.

Senior seminar topics would be
published three years in advance.
with students choosing a seminar by
the second semester of their sopho-
more year. Seminars would include
a maximum of 15 students, 25 ifthe
seminar is team-taught.

The proposal also included sug—
gestions to make the current fresh-
man tutorials, Io be renamed fresh-
manseminars,moreunifonninsuuc-
true and workload. Team—taught,
interdisciplinary topics would be
encouraged for both seminars.

The committee. composed of rep-
resentatives from every division, was
created last year to gather opinions
and ideas concerning the present
Grinnell curriculum and possible

changes. The group developed four
models for curriculum change. The
Seminar model emerged as the favor-
ite among faculty and students.

Sandy Motfett chair of the sub-‘
committee, said that the existingcur-
riculum will not be changed, but
ratherenriched with the new model.
“We don’t mean to imply that our
current curriculum is had. We now
offer a good deal of choice for stu-
dents and faculty, personal involve»
ment with advisors, and very strong
majors," Moifett said. “We don’t
want to change any ofthat.” he said.

According to Moffett, a majority,
of the students and faculty he has
spoken with are in favorofmaking a
change. The current curriculum was
implemented about 20 years ago and
has sincebeen periodically reviewed.

The soonest a new program could
actuallybe integrated into the system
would be next fall 7 but only if the
proposal is approved this year.

Last year the subcommittee drew
ﬁre from SGA vice-president Rob
Killion for its lack of student repre-
sentation. Since that time Moffett
and Killion, now the SGA president,
say they have spoken and clarified
any misunderstandings about the
subcommittee’s intentions.

“We wantand areencourag'tng total
involvement.“ said Moffett “The
committee is open to all input from
anyone interested in the program."
