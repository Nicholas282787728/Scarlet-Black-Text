Hippies? What Hippies?

 

To tlte Editor:

As someone Mike Kent might
consider to be a hippie (I have fairly
long hair. I often play hacky-sack
and I occasionally sport a pink tri-
angle button) I feel compelled to
respond to Mr, Kent‘scolumn in last
week's S & B.

There aren't any hippies on this
campusThehippiemovementended
about l5 years ago and the hippies
faded away.

You will no more ﬁnd hippies
today than you will ﬂappers or beat-
niks. These were all social groups
that existed during a cenain time
period and which are now gone.

Mr. Kent has never deﬁned “hip-
pie" so I am going to have to work
from the few signs Isaw forStudean
Against Hippies.

The principal groups thatMr. Kent
is against include people with long
hair,peoplewhohacky-sack,people
who wear pink triangle buttons, and
people who march in circles (which
I will take to mean people involved
in protests of one forrn or another).

I hardly seethe pointin campaign-
ing against long hair or hacky-sack-
ing. I would advise Mr. Kent to visit
abarber regularly, refrain from join-
ing hack circles and keep the expres-
sionsofhisopinionsrestrained.What
really confuses me is his drawing a
connectionbetweenthosethingsand
support of gays, lesbians and bi-
sexuals and political activism. Or
what his objection is to any of this.

In his column, he seems to say that
it is somehow wrong for people

(hippie or otherwise) to object to
policies of our government or tradi-
tions of our society. He holds up
“society’s values” as some sort of
integral unit and standard which he
seems to think is constant and cor»
feet. A cursory glance through his-
tory will tell you that societal values
change constantly, if slowly, and
can contradict values held by the
same society at other points in time.

Mr. Kent blames sexual promis-
cuity, various sexually transmitted
diseases and “the drug problem” on

'the actual hippies. I think it is very

naive to think that sexual promiscu-
ity and V.D. suddenly came into ex-
istence in the late Sixties.

And I think the term “drug prob-
lem”is misleading.0urcurrentdrug
problem, with all its related crime
and educational problems that Mr.
Kent cites, is with crack and cocaine
and. to a lesser extent, heroin and
even alcohol. The hippies were us-
ers of marijuana, hashish and other
more powerful psychedelics such as
LSD, psilocybin and peyote. Con-
nection’.7

Finally. Mr. Kent finds it funny
that hippies were not completely
successful in achieving their social
goals. I ﬁnd it tragic that Mike is
laughing at a genuine effort to uplift
human beings by promoting equal-
ity, world peace and love and under-
standingoffellowpeople,Sure,these
goals are idealistic in tire extreme,
butdoesthatmeanthatwe should be
satisfied with the status quo?

ERIC NORTON

Against His
Own Grain

To the Editor:

lfind it ironic that the morally upr
rightMikc Kentrantsandraves about
the hypocrisy of hippies in “A Gen-
eration of Shame” (Sept. 15) when
he himself is guilty of such a crime.

In his debutarticlein'l'heS & B on
Sept. 2, 1988, Kent explicitly out
lined the purpose of his column,
“Against the Grain": ”This column
is going to be the antithesis ofwhat-
ever the popular cause of the week
is. . ..The idea is: whatever opinion is
held by the majority will be the
opposite of the one expressed in this
column."

Kent follows up a year later in his
Sixtiesrbashing editorial, and en»
lightens us with a thoughteout hy-
pothesis. “I have a theory, though.
I don’t really think it matters to hip
pies what it is they are professing, so
long as it goes against some estab-
lished aspect of society.”

Could Kent possibly be accusing
hippies of. God forbid, going
“Against the Grain"?

The only thing about Kent‘s state-
ment which resembles a theory is
that he reaches a conclusion and
conveniently skips the analysis.

Isincerely hope that Kent’s edito—
rial does net reﬂect the quality of
Grinnell students’ writing abilities,
rather a lack of editorial material for
The S [it B. Fortunately, such an
editorial would fail to make the first
cut in most high school newspapers.

Ms. Goodwrench, Meet Ms. Coffee & Ms. Clean

 

To the Editor:

While sitting around enjoying a
wacky, whimsical, womyn's pot-
luck, we were elated to find that
scientists have found that it is pos-
sible to fertilize one egg with an-
other. Thus sperm is no longerneeded
to make babies and men could be-
come extinct Yes, like dinosaurs.
We began to wonder what it would
be like in a world with only womyn.
We came up with quite a list and the
funny thing is that it is all positive.

Therewouldbeno moreMr.Presi»
dent. No more controversial hous~
ing policy. No more discrepancies in
pay. No more impotence. No more
phallic imagery. Nomore cheap Polo
cologne. No more men in Women’s
Support Group. No more sexist lan-
guage. No more unsafe birth control
for womyn.

No more Jerry Falwell. No more
Mike Kent. No more William Buck-
ley. No more Morton Downey. No
more boring talkrshow hosts. No
more cruisers outside Tharp’s Phar-
macy.

No more bras. No more shaving.
No more Miss White America Pag-
eant NomoreNRA. No more fraterr
nities.

No more men getting off on les-

biansex.No more sexistrugby songs.
No more Penthouse magazines. No
more freshmen, only freshwomyn.
No more losing your name after
marriage.

No more First Lady, only First
Dyke.

No more patriarchy. No more Mr.
Coffee, Mr. Goodwrench,Mr. Clean,
Mr. Microphone. No more Dear Sir
letters.

No more dual role toilet seats. No
more color-coded clothing. No more
wondering ifit is a he or a she. No
more feminine deodorant spray. No
more Canon. No more homophobia.
No more Elvis look-alikes. No more
NCAA, NFL, NBA, SAT, KKK,
LSAT, MCAT, GRE. No more
Rambo, Rocky, Tom Selleck, Bmce
Willis.No more boyfriends. No more
Freud. No more Colonel Sanders.

No more men deﬁning our bodies.
No more male gynecologists. No
more closets. No more abortions.

There would be more love. More
potluck suppers. More womyn with
high self esteem. More athletic
womyn. More peace. More men-
struatlon celebrations. More cotton
clothing. More clothes in big sizes.
More body hair. More satisfying sex
(with a few exceptions).

More “bitter shells" of womyn.
More Sophia Kovalesky. More
femalephysicists and chemists. More
Birkenstocks. More garlic salt. More
Mary Daly and AdrienneRich. More
