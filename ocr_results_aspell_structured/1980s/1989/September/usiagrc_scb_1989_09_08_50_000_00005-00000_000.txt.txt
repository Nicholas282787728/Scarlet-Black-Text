Terrorism —

Quite Real

 

To the Editor:

In a column last week Bill Lohaus
expressed doubts as to whether ter-
rorism exisLsand as much as said itis
America’s fault if itdoes. I think that
these ideas should not go unchal-
lenged.

lndividualswho should know, such
as Mr. Yassar Arafat, have conceded
that terrorism does exist. Arafat‘s
recent renunciation of the same is
evidence of this, since it is rare that
people feel compelled to renounce a
form of conduct that does not exist.

Mr. Lohaus’ statement Lhatduring
thisdecade the US. ignored interests
in the Middle Eastolher than Israel's
artd thus encouraged “terrorism“ is
factually wrong. The sale of thc
AWAC planes to Saudi Arabia was
not in the interest of or supported by
Israel. Neither was the sending of
American ships to the Persian gulf in
Iﬁael’s interest.

A strong case can be made that
both of these actions 7 the ﬁrst,
arming a sworn enemy of Israel and
the latter. attempting to end aconflict
that actually beneﬁted Israel 7 were

hostile to Israeli interests.

Mr. Lohaus’ statement that during
the time when Pres. Carter was active
in the Middle East there was little
terrorism implies that those who now
support terrorism—Syriaand Libya,
etc. 7 were in some way apprecia-
tive ofCarter’s efforts.

Actually, the response of all Arab
states (except Oman) to the Camp
David agreement that Caner negoti-
ated was to break off all diplomatic
relations with Egyptand expel it from
the Arab League.

What is the difference between
putting bombs in a plane and drop
ping them from one? One is done for
the sole purpose of killing innocent
civilians and the other can be used to
destroy military targets. ltis true that
civilian lives are often lost when
planes are used to drop bombs, but
when bombs are puton planes that is
the only result,

Mrlohaus accuses Israelofbomb-
ing populations in areas “of no Strate-
gic value.” In an area such as Leba—
non, ﬁlled with dozens of militias, it
is almost impossible to draw a dis-
tinction between civilian areas and
areas in which militias are stationed.
When the stronghold of the Hezbolr
lah militia is described in The Nation
as being “in the south suburbs of
Beirut“ the difficulty becomes clear.
If Israel were to retaliate only with
the cenainty that no civilians would
be lost it would lose all capability to
dcterattack from Lhevarious militias.
