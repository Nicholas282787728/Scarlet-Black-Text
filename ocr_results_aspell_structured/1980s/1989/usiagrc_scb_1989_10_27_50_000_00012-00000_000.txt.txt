paper glut that‘s choking mills na-
tionwide. Increased public involve-
ment in recycling has led to a build-
up of waste paperat the mills, which
often can’t process the paper faSt
enough. And though people are
bringing theirpaper in toberecycled,
they're not buying recycled paper
products — a necessary step for
recycling to work. A paper glut at
recycling mills has forced manymills
to turn away waste paper: some re-
cyclers even end up paying the mill
to take the paper.

Last year the Environmental Inter-
est Group was getting paid $7 a ion
for cardboard, $15 a ton for news-
print,$40aton for colored paper and
550 a ton for white paper. But group
members say they fear lower prices
this year. especially for the news-
print, uianks to the paper glut.The
recent recycling efforthasa forebear
in LEAP, an environmental interest
group that ﬂourished on campus in
the early Seventies. Biology profes-
sor Kenneth Christiansen started the
group in the summer of 1969, as a

‘ part of a course he was teaching.

In its heyday, LEAP — for Local
Effluent Abatement Procedures —
had 36 organizers and 300 volun-
teers. The group spearheaded the
ﬁrstrecycling drive on campus. with
collection bins in each dorm and
teams of student volunteers running
the operation.

The group also didadetailed study
of Grinnell’s environmental impact
and recommended ways the college
could cut down resource use, LEAP
effectively protested the use of haz-
ardous pesticides by the physical
plantand got the college to switch to
a more energy-efﬁcient heating sys—
tent. The group's most notorious
project was measuring and collect
ing all the food thrown away in colv
lege dining halls 7 and then dis-
playing it in bins in Cowles. The last
vestiges of LEAP can be seen in the
campus mail room: the ride-sharing
board and the wooden paper-collec»
tion bins.

THE, LONGHORN

LEAP‘s recycling program :

stopped after three years, mostly

because the group had trouble lind- »

ingabuyerfor the waste paper. They
ended up having to transport it to
Des Moines themselves — a time-
consuming and expensive job. “It
was costing us quite a bit of money,
rather than making money, to re—
cycle the paper,” Christiansen said.
But there was also the problem of
student apathy. “We got progres-
sively less cooperation from the
students as the novelty of the thing
woreoff." Christiansen said. “People
were tluowing all kinds of things”
into the recycling bins. he said,

Recycler Jake Kosek is also in
volved in the administration’s ﬁrst
effort on recycling 7 a committee
formed to study recycling at the
college. He says that in September
he got a note from college vice-
presidentWaldo Walker inviting him
to a faculty meeting to discuss recy
cling. Kosek says he rushed into the
meeting a few minutes late, only to
discover that hehimself was to chair
a faculty subcommittee on recycling.

The recycling committee, chaired
by Walker. was formed in mid-Sep»
tember to discuss how to step up
recycling at the college, The com-
mittee’s 13 members. who were
chosen by college president George
Drake, are broken up into four sub-
committees. Kosek chairs the recy-
cling subcommittee, which includes
physical plant director Dan Tindall
and service bureau head Pat Boyd.
The other committees i on paper
flow through the mail, conservation
of paper, and finance —- include
student government vice»presidenr
AlannaTyler,deanofstudentaffairs
Tom Crady, college secretary Bill
Deminoff and dining services head
David McConnell. The committee
meets every two weeks and was
scheduled to meet yesterday.

Walker said he‘s been concerned
with the waste of paper for some
time. “I know what the output has
been at the college, and it’s just
terrible," he said. Last year the col-
lege used over ll million sheets of

paper.

ministration, which it presented last
year in a written report w Drake,
Walker, Tindall and Crady. The
groupisproposingacooperativeplan
involving student volunteers, the
physical plant and the administra-
tion. Under the plan, a combination
of student volunteers and paid sut-
dent workers would collect paper
from dorms and other campus build-
ings, and bring it to drop-off sites.
The physical plant would take over
from there, picking up the paper and
storing it, and selling it to a mill.

The group is also asking the col-
lege to buy a cardboard baler, a
machine that crushes cardboard, and
permanent recycling bins for every
dormitory floor. Fire codes now
prevent the group from keeping its
collection boxes on dorm ﬂoors, and
require that they be kept in dorm
lounges instead.

But Kosek said that balers and
binsarcjustpartofthesolution.Just
as important as getting the equip-
ment, he said, is getting the support
of the administration and a long-
term commitment to the project.
Kosek said that students at other
colleges are having a much harder
time with their recycling projects.
“It would be nice to have Grinnell as
an example," he said.

How much support is the college
willing to give the recycling pro-
gram?

“I want to look into it,” Walker
said. “I don‘t want to make an in-
vestment and have us stuck out on a
limb withoutsome pretty good prom-
iseofhaving the program successful
before we invest a lot of money in it.
But I certainly would support it”

The only problem Walker forea
sees is storage of the paper, and the
possible difﬁculty in ﬁnding a mill
to buy it.

Dan Tindall,directorof the physi-
cal plant, also sounds enthusiastic
about the group’s proposals, includ-
ing the involvementof workers from
the physical plant.

“We're just seeing the tip of the
icebergwirhrecycling,"Tindallsaid.
“We're all going to have to get in-
volved in recycling,”

Tindall said that workers from
buildings and grounds could start
picking up the paper within a few
weeks. “We‘ve already got the
wheelsin motion,”hesaid. “Ifwe’re
the Pioneers, then let’s go for it."

Tindallsaid rceyclingisespecially
necessary now, with the Poweshiek
County dump nearly full. County
officials say the dump will reach its
capacity within a year and a half, at
which time all county garbage —
including the college's —— will have
tobe shipped to nearby Newton, and
at great cost.

“The answer to solid-waste dis-
posal isn't shipping it to the next
town," Tindall said. He said he’s
already talking with county officials
about having the college cooperate
on new solid-waste disposal meth»
ods, including recycling.

And while the administration is
discussing future recycling plans.
some college offices are already
switching over to buying recycled
paper. Conni Gauze of the Office of
Special Services, who orders the
paper for all campus copying ma-
chines, says she has switched to
recycled paper — completely.

“I’ve gone to complete recyled
paper. I don‘t order anything else
any more," Gauze said. She said the
last order of nonrecycled paper was

 

made in J une.

And the recycled paper, she says,
ismuch cheaper titan theXerox brand
paper the college bought before.

Recycled paper’s one drawback is
the dust it leavu behind in copying
machines and computer printers.
Gauze said she has gotten some
complaints about the dust, which
some people claim clogs the ma»
chines and leaves them more sus-
ceptible to breakdown. “But on the
whole I would say the majority of
the campus is very receptive to it and
is glad thatwe’re going in thatdirec»
tion," Gauze said.

The service bureau, which does all
of the college’s bulk copying and
produces the phone directories and
weekly campus memo, is still using
nonrecycled paper Pat Boyd, direc-
tor of the service bureau. says she is
concerned about whether recycled
paper will feed through the tempera»
mental copying machines as well m
new paper. But she said she is plan
ning to test the recycled paper in the
machines.

Computer services is still using
noruecycled paper, but says it‘s test-
ing recycled paper in its computer
printers.

“We’re researching it very care-
fully, particularly because of our
machines. The laserpn'nters are very
sensitive to a lot of dust.” said lean
Kinnaird of computer services,

“We’re looking into it very care-
fully. We’re aware of the problem
and want to help in all the ways we
can," Kinnaird said. But Kinnaird
also said that switching to recycled
paper would be expensive, costing
S3 or $4 moreper case than the peper
now in use. The cost increase would
be “considerable when you consider
the budget for a year,” she said.

”We have an open mind We’re
lookingvery carefully into thewhole
matter,” Kinnaird said.
