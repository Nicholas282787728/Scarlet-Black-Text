all racial. economic, and religious
boundaries. (Statistics show that
there are about I million cases of
child abuse annually in the U.S.)
The film gives a balanced but real
face to these ominous statistics.
Director Leonard Kurz underscores
thecycle of abuse with interviewsof
prisoners who were abused as chil-
dren and of parents, counselors,
doctors, and other professionals.

Going beyond the initial shock
aspect of child abuse, the film ex-
plores the root causes of theproblem
and explains current methods of
treatment and prevention The film
stresses an interdisciplinary ap
proach, with professionals from
various ﬁelds must cooperating in
order to arrest the cycle of abuse.

Mr. Smith Goes to Washington
This moving story of an honest

country bumpkin who is thrust into

the Washington world oipowcr and

corruptboondogglers. Although Mr.
Smith is sadly na‘r’ve, we ﬁnd our-
selves looking up to this hero of
uncompromising principles. With
the help of his Washington secre-
tary, Saunders (Jean Arthur), Mr.
Smith ﬁghts against forces of evil in
the nation‘scapitaltThe l'rghtculmi-
natcs in an emodon-packed scene in
which ML Smith holds the Senate
floor for a gmeling twenty-three
hours, earnestly speaking out for his
ideals.

The ﬁlm is moral without being
pedagogical. Here is no grade-school
lesson in being honest and good.
Rather. thiSis acmcial ﬁlm,portray-
ing the very essence of American
ideals. Stewart’s acting is brilliant,
and Capra is at his best.

Shows

Gallery Talk
by Ceramist Mark Gordon
Making use of such diverse mate
rials as borax, burnt chains and tele-
phone poles, Mark Gordon creates a
balance between primitive and
modern aspectsofclay. Gordon is an
accomplished andwidely recognized
cerarnist who combines traditional
pottery-making techniques from

around the world with the crafts
modern and experimental aspects.

On display at the Burling Libmry
Print and Drawing Study Room are
Gordon’s “traditional“ vessels along
with someof his moremodem works.
There are photographs of some of
Gordon’s installations, large con-
ceptual pieces which Gordon has
constructed elsewhere. Most of these
installations, and many of the smaller
pieces, consist of many small and
similar pieces of pottery which to
gether form the larger whole. For
example, one of Gordon's
installations, MUNDA Y8:00-
11:39AM22MAY1989. consists of
thirty»six similar clay tusks/homs
wrapped in buntt chain, suspended
from two 40-foot telephone poles.
The title represents the time elapsed
duringwhich thirty-sixelephants (on
average) are killed by poachers in
Africa. Another piece, Gumball
Tetrahedron, is described by theartist
in this manner: ”Through a dynamic
of implied flux, the work attempts to
engage the viewer by conjuring what
may be called an empathetic/kines-
thetic response. In a way, I want to
convey a deﬁance of gravity."

Gordon has traveled to Egypt,
Israel. Turkey, Greece, Portugal,
Morocco, Jordan, Syria and the
Dominican Republic in a quest to
learn traditional pottery-making
techniques. His adaptation of these
traditions is shown in his work. The
cerarnist also makes use of modern
and experimental techniques, such
as sagger ﬁring. wrapping his ves~
sels with copper wire before firing
them, and throwing different Chemi-
cals 7 such as salt, borax. copper
sulfate, and soda ash 7 onto the
pieces as they are being ﬁred.

The artist will be presenting a
gallery talk in the Burling Print and
Drawing Study Room September 6‘
at4:15 pm. He will Show slides of
some of his other works and go into
detail about the techniques he uses.
Gordon earned a BA. from Oberlin
College and he has an M.F.A. from
the Ohio State University. He is
currently artist-in~rosidence at the
Des Moines Art Center.
