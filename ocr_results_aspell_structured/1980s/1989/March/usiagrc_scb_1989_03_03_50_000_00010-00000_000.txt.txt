Colorado College ensemble
presents music for bowed piano

Stephen Scott's music for
bowed piano will be presented by
the Colorado College New Music
Ensemble in Herrick Chapel at 9
pm. on Thursday, March 9.

The New Music Ensemble,
made up of 10 musicians,
specializes in presenting Scott‘s
bowed-piano compositions, and
has performed extensively in
Europe, Australia, and North
America. In concert, the
ensemble surrounds a grand piano

with lid removed and sounds the
strings in intricate, interlocking
patterns with filaments of nylon
and small sticks covered with
horsehair, to produce what 24
Hours magazine calls “a unique
sound picture."

The ensemble has recorded on
the New Albion label and
performed numerous radio and
television broadcasts in the
United States and abroad.
