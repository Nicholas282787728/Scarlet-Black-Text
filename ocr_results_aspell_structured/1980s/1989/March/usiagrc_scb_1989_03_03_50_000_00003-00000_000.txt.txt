Students help Mesquakie

children adjust to

by Lynnca Eagle

Every Thursday evening, 15
to 20 Grinnell Students of the
Native American Interest Group
travel to the Mesquakie
settlement near Tama, Iowa, in
order to provide a tutoring service
for Native American children.

The tutoring program,

originally started by Iowa State,
is designed mainly to encourage
Mesquakie children to stay in
school. It is directt'd toward fifth
through eighth-graders who are
adjusting to the transfer from the
settlement schools to private
ones. There is a high drop-out
rate among the native children,
largely caused by the cultural
differences between the two
schools. After making the
transfer, Mesquakie children often
receive abuse from the other
students. Tutorcr Toln Berger
stated, “Ifthcy survive that, they
can go to high school.”

The history of the
Mesquakies is similar to that of
other Native American nations.
They were moved away from
their homes, and were conLinImlly
relocated. However, unlike other
nations, they did not Schle on a
reservation. According to Berger,
they became the first Native
Americans to become lax-paying
citizens and to purchase their own
property.

The traditional culture has

companies to ”mlk” about future
weapons systems plans, or simply
for “having breakfast with them."

This type of behavior, if not
lllcgal,is certainly unethical. (And
afterBush vowedthathisadtninis
tmtion would be “above even the
hint of unethical behavior.") By
pointingtoTowcr'sdrinkingprobr
lcms, instead of to his financial
dealings with defense contractors,
as the reason fordenying approval,
the Senators are inherently con-
doning such behaviort This silent
endorsement is appalling, By not
emphatically pressing the issue of
Tower‘s consultlng profits, the
Senators seem to be implying that
if Tower was not a lush he would
sail right through the confirmation
process. Indeed,onlyoneSenator,
Teddy Kennedy, cited the dealings
as a major concern, stating that
”perhaps in spite of his extraordir

been retained at the settlement,
and cross-cultural differences can
be extensive. For example,
Berger said, the playtime
schedule; for after the tutoring
sessions may be canceled because
it is believed that running outside
at night can raise the spirits of
Ihedcad.

Senator Tower could still bring an
open mind to the awesome deci-
sions that lie ahead on our national
defense. But America should not
be forced to take that chance.”
Sadly. these proceedings reveal
a lot about the problems of our
government, and about the Senate
in particular. It seems that the
Senators are reluctant to make an
issue ofTower’s decision to cash
in on the information he obtained
through his work for the govern-
ment. They fear the microscopic
scrutiny that they might be sub»
jectcd to if they pressed the issue.
(Case in point. after Sen. Nunn
harshly criticized Tower for abus-
ing alcohol, an old story surfaced
thaINunnwasinvolvedindrunkcn
driving incident 24 years ago in
which he hit another car anti then
left the scene of die crime.) Thus
the conspicuous silence on the is
sue of accepting money from the
defense companies raises doubts
about the Senators’ own pasts,
especially regarding the acceptance
of sorealled “honoraria,” which

schoolwork. The prograln has
other concerns as well. The
group’s goal, said tutorcr
Meridith Levy, “is just to keep
the children inspired to learn.“ It
is a way to provide role models,
and to show that a college
education can be an option.

The tutorers leave every
Thursday at 6 pm. from the
HRC/GRC and return at 9:30 or

allow Senators to receive substan-
tial payments for making brief
appearances and token speeches.

The question that remains is
which of the two evils do we ac-
ccpt: that the past ethical breaches
in Tower’s dealings with defense
contractors simply do not bother
the Senators much, or that the
Senators are fearful of having the
spotlight turned on their own past
transactions? Either way we must
be disappointed in Iheirjudgment.
And eitherwaythe Senatehasfailed
to send the correct message to the
people of this country.

Jeff's wine-
tasting tips

by I eff Phelps

When the Scarlet and Black
asked me to write a column about
wine, I jumped at the chance
without really thinking about
what I was getting into, After
all, I enjoy talking about wine7
it's been my hobby for years and
part of my vocation for thc last
three years. What I hadn‘t
counted on was how difficult it
would be to communicate to you
what little I know about wine
without the benefit of being able
to look you straight in the eye
over a filled wine glass! That’s
right, folks, the best way to team
about wine is to drink it.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure it’s the
wine that lures people to my
classes, and not what I have to
say about wine.

Actually, there is quite a bit
that can be covered in print and I
promise to do my best to deal
with the most readable aspects of
the trade. We will be discussing
grape varieties and the smells and
tastes associated with them, we‘ll
talk about matching foods and
wines, and we‘ll give you some
tips for picking out wines at

restaurants and wine shops.
Hopefully, we'll remove some of
the mystique surrounding wine,
or at least enough of it for you to
feel comfortable experimenting
with it.

In fact, comfort may be the
key to the whole “wine thing," It
only takes one encounter with a
bona fide winc snoot to ruin a
person for life. I don‘t aim to
bowl you over with facts, and
I’m sure not going to tell you
what you should like. I would,
however, like for you to have
enough information to see the
fun in all of this stuff about
wine. The more information you
have, the more fun it is, and that
makes for greater comfort, as I
see it. Remember, there are
many truly great wines out there,
and a lot of them aren‘t as
expensive as you might think.
So grab your ID, pick up a bottle
of wine, and start out on what
may turn out to be a long,
comfortable journey.

Next time, We’ll talk about
the Riesling grape.
