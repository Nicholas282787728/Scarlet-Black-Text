Financial aid
Continued from page 1

Lincoln explained why
Grinnell students might graduate
with a fewer debts than students
at other private colleges. “We
look at grants (and) scholarships
first, and then we provide self-
help in the form of loan and
employment," he said, Data
shows that no Student receives
loans before grants. The five
students who will graduate with a
cumulative debt of more than
310,000 are all high-need
students, who received 75 to 80
percent of their college costs paid
by Grinnell or federal loans.
Over four years, Lincoln claimed
that the parents‘ contribution for
the five seniors “at most, would
have been 32000 (or) $3000,”

Instead, the college attempts to
avoid overburdening all students.

OSFA does not keep records
on the number of students who
attend graduate school and their
accumulation of debt during
further education. Because
students change their career
objectives, it is impossible to
plan individual aid to account for
future graduate~school plans.
Lincoln said, “Our overall
objective is to keep the loan
obligation as low as possible."

Since the Loan Indebtedness
Report does not account for non-
need-based loans, like those from
banks and companies, it is
possible that individual loan

indebtedness will actually be
higher than the study shows.
Lincoln said tltat it was im-
possible for OSFA to calculate
the number of students reeeivmg
loans from non-need»based
sources, and refused to make any
estimate on the subject.

“I think the steps that have
been taken by Grinnell College.
in its overall response to
assisting students. place Grinnell
students in a pretty fortunate
position as they look at the loan
obligation they will have relative
to what the overall education is
costing them." Lincoln said. “I
think they’re in pretty good shape
now."

Jewish students and
faculty discuss
organization change

by Laura Moran

The Grinnell Jewish
Community held a meeting
Monday evening in order to
determine the needs and wants of
Grinncil’s Jewrsh students, Led
by Karen Bell. the interim Jew-
ishrsludent coordinator, and Anita
Solow. associate professor of
mathematics, the meeting began
with the announcement that.
beginning next year. the college
wtll hire a resident adviser who
will also serve as the Jewish
student adviser.

After receiving a proposal
written by a combined group of
stuticnts and faculty, the
udtttinisttation decided that while
tltcy searched for a candidate for
the permanent RA position, Bell
would be hired to fill the vacancy
created by the resignation of
Debbie Entine last summer. Bell
and future advisers will occupy
full inlc positions. which is a
rad departure from, the
position of past advisers, who
only came to campus once a
week.

Another great change was the
decision to change the group‘s
name frotn “Chalutzim” to “The
Jewish Student Organization
080)." Students felt this was
necessary to emphasize the
changes in the organization.

Numerous questions were
brought up by the 20 or so
students in attendance. These
included queries about possible
linkage with national and other
collegiate Jewish organizations,
and concerns about stressing
Jewish culture in the organization
instead of focusing only on Ju»
daism’s religious aspects. Since
Judaism is such a diverse
religion, it was felt that a cultural
emphasis might better unite
Grinnell’s Jewish community

There was a good deal of
discussion about the impormrtce

of establishing a feeling 'of
family among Jewish students
and faculty at Grinnell in order to
strengthen the
community

Many students expressed a
desire for a particular place where
they could meet, study, or just
spend free time. However, the
general consensus was that this
interest is definitely a long-term
goal, and not something the
community will emphasize in the
near future

All in all, thC community
expressed a great amount of
gratitude towards the college for
the creation of the
RA/coordinvtor of Jewish Slu'
dents position. Studcnts also
expressed satisfaction with the
way things are being handled.

Also discussed was the
upcoming Jewish Cultural Week
and some of the activities
involved. This Saturday in
Norris Lounge at 7 pm. there
will be an early celebration of
Purim. a Jewish holiday which
occurs during spring break. The
party will center around the
baking and / eating of
hamentashcn, a traditional Purim
pastry. On Wednesday, March 1.
Linda Fishman of Des Moines
will be speaking in North
Lounge at 7:30 p.m. on the
subject: “Surviving the
Holocaust: A Personal Remem-
brance." Fishman survived
several different concentration
camps, and has spoken
throughout lowa about her
experience. A few other events
are planned, including the comedy
film ”ester Street on Sunday
night.

All students. regardless of
personal religious convictions,
are encouraged to attend these
events, since they promise to be
enjoyable and informative.
