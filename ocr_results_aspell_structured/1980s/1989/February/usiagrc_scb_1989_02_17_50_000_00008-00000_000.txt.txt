Colors: lame, lame, lame

by Matt Macho

I had high expectations for
this flick. It was, after all,
directed by the certifiably insane
Dennis Hopper, and it aroused a
great deal of controversy on its
release. That often signals to me
that the movie is making people
uncomfortable and defensive by
dealing with a subject in an
unorthodox and perhaps very
effective way. Hollywood needs
more iconoclasm, I thought. But
when I finally saw tlte movie I
was in for a big disappointment,
since it was LAME, LAME,
LAME.

It's supposed to be a “hard-
hitting" look at the Los Angeles
gang and drug problem (a good
topic that‘s been ignored by
Hollywood and certainly still
isn't covered well in this ﬂick),
with Robert Duvall and (ugh)
Sean Penn starring as cops in a
special antirgang unit, They’re
supposed to be going head-t0~
head with the two biggest and
baddest rival gangs, the bloods
(wearing red) and the crips
(wearing blue)—hence the clever
title. But the movie is a flop.

First, it uses the same tired
old "eager young cop thrown
together with the experienced old
cop" cliche that‘s been making
me nauseous for years. Second,
the plot wanders to and fro, here
and there, with very little
happening. So many stupid
things happen it defies belief.
Robert Duvall is supposed to
have a “community-building“
mentality, so whenever he
catches guys selling crack he
gives them a stern lecture and lets
them go This is so dumb it
even went out in TV cop shows
20 years ago, Get real. Ditto
with Duvall's driving around LA
ghettos and stopping at street
comers to ask, “Have you seen
any gang member around? Have
you been doing any drugs?”

though this does lead to the only
glimmer of entertainment in the
flick, as a young street punk
replies, “Why no, officer, we Just
Say No to drugs.“ Penn’s
character, on the other hand, is a
real asshole, abusive and petty,
who strangles suspects and sprays
people in the face aerosol paint.
Overall much more swinish,
much more like a real cop.

The movie was also
lambasted as being excessively
violent, which is nonsense. If
anything, it’s not violent
enough. There is one major
shooting, but it‘s way at the end
of the film, and you have to sit
through hours of drivel without
anyone getting snuffed. Not only
is this a disappointment to fans
of mass mayhem, but it also

. pulls the rug out from under the

point of the film, which is to
show the violence and despair of
drug gangs. Ask anyone who
lives in a major city just how
violent it is when gangs are in
:onflict and compare it with the
stuff in the film, and you’ll find
the celluloid just doesn’t measure
up. I don’t know whether
Hopper wimped out and decided
to pull punches or if stuff was
cut without his consent, but at
any rate the ﬂick is lacking.

Even the title music track, a
rap by Ice T, doesn't quite make
it. Ice T does a good job of
giving a punk‘s perspective on
why he lives this way and the
despair he feels, but the rap's
diluted with the monotonous
refrain “Colors, colors... colors,
colors,” which is guaranteed to
get on your nerves.

You may be tempted to see
this one just to see what the fuss
was about when it was released
months ago. Don’t bother.
These colors just don‘t fly.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Swimming to

Cambodia:

Spalding Gray tells a story

Spalding Gray is ﬁrst and
foremost a storyteller. In fact, he
is so good at telling stories that
some critics have heralded him as
a modern»day Mark Twain.
Before making a dent on the
storytelling circuit Gray tried to
pay his bills by acting.

Swimming to Cambodia is
the story of his experiences in
Thailand during the shooting of
The Killing Fields, 3 film in
which Gray played the small part
of the ambassador’s assistant. It
is not a prerequisite to have seen
The Killing Fields, although it
does help since much of the
content involves Gray's dramatic
personal findings concerning the

genocide of millions
Cambodians.

The film focuses solely on
Gray, as director Jonathan
Demme hardly makes himself
noticeable, a technique that won
him praise for his direction of the
Talking Heads in Star) Making
Scnre. Due to the nature'of
storytelling much of this film
lives in the viewer’s mind, not
on the screen. Nevertheless, even
through the somewhat detached
medium of film, Gray exhibits a
mesmerizing ability to carry the
audience through a roller coaster
of experiences.

Amadeus: a musical and

visual feast

Amadeus, Milos Forman‘s
film of Peter Schaffer’s play
about the life of Mozart, not
unexpectedly, differs from the
original. The play was a
compelling pitting of mediocrity
against genius, Salieri against
Mozart. It was told through the
eyes of Salieri, who‘s spirit was
shattered, not only by the
perfection of Mozart's music, but
by the fact that Mount was such
a disheveled brat, no exemplar of
humanity. The movie places
Mozart at the center, and thus the
clear opposition of the original is
blurred, and the film turns into a
biography, 3 love story, and 2

Easy Money:

nary Money, starring Rodney
Dangerfield, was James
Signorelli’s first film. The
film’s premise, with which alot
could have been done, is that
Rodney’s mother-in»law dies and
leaves his wife ten million
dollarsiprovidcd that Rodney
gives up having fun: no pot, no
booze, no women, no more
feeding himself like a pig. Much
of what could have been done

story of revenge. The movie
loses much of the dramatic
tension of the original, by this
shift of focus.

The movie has much to
recommend it, aside from its
storyrline, though. The music is
by Neville Marriner conducting
the Academy of St. Martin»in~
the-Fields. The operas shown
within the film are staged by
Twyla Tharp, and are filmed in
the Tyl Theater in Prague, where
Don Giovanni was first
performed in 1787. The musical
and visual feast presented, alone,
make the film worth seeing.

overkill

with this is ignored though, for
just plain showing us Rooney‘s
slob whose only interest is in
getting loaded. In his wanting to
show us a tacky character,
Signorelli goes for overkill,
giving us a vulgar, tacky movie
to boot. Believe it or not, Jim,
we could've got the point.

Album Review

R.E.M.'s
Green tries
too hard

by Thomas Beverly

A new R.E.M. album has
always been eagerly anticipated
by critics and fans alike, and the
build-up to the release of Green,
the band‘s latest effort, was no
exception. The group’s move
from I.R.S. Records to Warne
Bros. prompted much speculation
about a new sound or, worse yet,
a commercial success, No one
was particularly surprised, then
when the new album managed to
alienate longtime fans whil
attracting an ever-increasin
faction of the dreaded Topr40
audience. The sound on Green
is, as suspected, somewhat no
for this acclaimed combo, and at
last check it was setting records
for sales.

It is always difficult
objectively to judge a new album
from a group whose previou‘
albums were of consistent
quality, since inevitable com»
parisons to earlier work get in th
way of actual feelings about the
new material. Keeping this
thought in my mind, Iset to th
task of attempting to see this
album for what it is, ignoring
R,E.M.'s past. However, I hav
to admit that I failed, but only
because Green is so clearly infe-
rior to any other R.E.M. albu /
(with the possible exception 0
1987‘s Document). I almost
refused to believe that I was
listening to the satne band.

The first thing that struck me
about Green is how BIG it is. It
has BIG drums. BIG vocals,
BIG lyrics. BIG guitar. BIG
sales. It was recorded for a BIG
record company. R.E,M. has
clearly hit the BIG time. In other
words. Green is a BIG dis’
appointment. .

The tempos of most of the
songs here are unnaturally slow '
placing emphasis on th
lumbering percussion of Bill
Berry, while Peter Buck’s guitar
scrapes and churns beneath
Michael Stipe’s dronings, The
familiar R.E.M. sound has beeri
newly manufactured, bigger bu
not better-this music sounds .
it it would be perfect to d.
construction work to. .

To be quite blunt, though
the real problem with this ne
album is not its dinosau
proportions, but rather thr
absence of any worthwhile songs
The material on Green rang'
from somewhat interesting (“Yet
Are tllc Everything") tt
obnoxiously sclf»indulgent (“Th-
Wrong Child") to just plain sill
(“Stand”). Stipe's vocals, one
an ir sistible though bare
intelligible mumble, have bee
transformed into a grating
painstakingly cnunciute
