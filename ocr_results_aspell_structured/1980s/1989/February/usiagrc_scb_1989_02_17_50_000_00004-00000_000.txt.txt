Students glad to be "home"

Spend half a year strolling
through French streets or
exploring the remains of an
ancient culture in Greece. Or try

scrutinizing unusual customs in

but most returning Grinnellians
say they looked forward to
returning. Almost all of them
wanted to see friends and family
again, even if it meant giving up
the fun and freedom of foreign
programs. Some students, like
May-Lee Chai. are returning for
the second semester of their
senior year. which made uiem

“Do any factories in Nanjing

offer extended maternity leaves?"

“Yes. Some. Of course,
companies that have a lot of
women workers, garment
factories for example, cannot let
them take extended leaves. If
everyone took it, what would
happen to the factory?“

Once back to small»toWn
Iowa, however, there are
adjustments to be made. John
Pozar commented that after a
semester roaming free in London,
it took a little adjusting to re-
member that thcrc isn’t
something exciting to do every
night, He said he likes relaxing,
but found it difficult to adjust to
dull Fridays. However, Dawn
Benard spent her scmestcr in
small-town Scotland. Coming
back to Grinnell, she said. was a
step up in excitement since
Grinnell has more social
activities than the area she was
in

Adjusting to academics can
also be a shock. Pozar said that
it was a lot easier to slide by in
London than in Grinnell He felt
he had gotten back into better
study habits by now, but at first
he was surprised at his workload.

do you do, each person in this

work.“

“We all do different things.
One person writes essays for
magazines. One person helps
women ﬁnd nannies. One person
helps women who have problems
with their husbands. Etcetera,"

I thanked them and gathered
together my notes. After I left

hands together and stomp my feet
in an attempt to revive my frozen
extremities. A long time after I
had left the Women’s Federation,
I was still shivering.

whether she had gone abroad or
not. For Becky Klein the
adjustment was too sudden, since
she returned from West Germany
three days before starting classes
at Grinnellt Most students shared
Benard’s views, however, She
said that “after two days. it felt
like I had never left."

Returning Grinnellians found
the campus much the way they
had left it. Shannon Burkes was
surprised only by the cold
weather, Pozar, like many
others, found he didn’t know
several people at the ﬁrst parties
he went to. since he hadn't met
the freshmen and transfers in the

Grinnell has no nightclubs,

most returning students. homer

Symposium focuses on
severity of depression

by Melissa Koch

The National Alliance for the
Mentally Ill (NAMI), an
organization based in
Washington, DC. has chosen
Grinnell to be one of the first
colleges to sponsor a one-hour
symposium on depression as part
of a national scrics. The
symposium took place in South
Lounge at 7 pm. on Thursday,
February 16.

Farrell Fitch, the publicr
relations representative for
NAMI. visited Grinnell College
and spoke with Dave Clark, the
resident adviser for James and
I-Iaincs halls, about the group's
selection of liberal-arts colleges
to sponsor the symposium.
Fitch, said that typically
depression starts between the ages
of 18 and 25t College students
often experience depression due to
the changes that college life
evokes. Students also have a
tendency to ignore clinical
depression as merely a “blue
funk“ because of the association
of depression with mental illness.

The symposium occured in
three parts and was moderated by
Dr, William W. Dodson, a
psychiatrist and director of
student health at Georgetown
University in Washington,*D.C.
The first part was a medical
analysis of depression by Dr. Arr
lene Hegge, head of divisional
research in the clinical-research
branch of the National Institute

of Mental Health. In the second
part, two former college students
discussed their depression
throughout college and the
treatment they found after
college. In the third part, Lisa
Bard from the Poweshiek Mental
Health Center discussed the
resources available in the area.

The recognizable symptoms
of the clinically depressed, which
were discussed at the symposium.
arc insomnia or excessive
sleeping, changed eating patterns.
inability to concentrate, difficulty
in making decisions, perceiving
all tasks as monumental,
impaired physical wellrbcing, and
withdrawal.

Following the symposium,
there was an in—servicc meeting
for staff members of Student
Affairs, Career Development, the
Health Center, and other
facilities, to discuss the sym-
posium and the resources
available to those in the area who
are seeking help for mental
illness. Torn Crady, dean of
Student Affairs, clearly expressed
the goal for NAMI and Grinnell
when he said, “We hope that this
symposium will educate people
about depressive illness and make
them aware of the types of
treatment available. We also
hope that open discussion of the
very imporlant topic will help
remove the stigma too often
associated with depressive
illncss.”

“0K. what‘s the point?"

The point is. if we want to look
for oppression we can ﬁnd it just
about anywhere, under just about
any circumstances Just about
everybody has ties to a group that
has, at one time or another, been
persecuted, I'm not saying that
blacks havcn't had more than their
share, they have, butthey aren't the
ONLY group with a history. lfour
college is really interested in pro-
moting ethnic pride then we should
have some speakers on the Japar
ncsc internment. We should have
some speakers on the Holocaust.
We should have speakers from
every ethnic background Black

History Month is good, yes. but the
college should not emphasize the
problems and history of one ethnic
or racial group to the exclusion of
others. Every group has the right to
pride in its past, its accomplishr
ments. and its future.

What we need are speakers from
other backgrounds. Our obsession
with the culture of a single group is
coming at the expense of others. I
would go so far as to say that not
only should the college feel the
obligation to present the histories
of other groups but that the other
clhnit: groups have the RIGHT to
have their histories presented.

Sort of inherent within the defini-
