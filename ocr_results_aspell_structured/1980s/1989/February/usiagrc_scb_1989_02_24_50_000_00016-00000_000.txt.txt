Nightmare on Elm Street:
standard horror stuff

by Matt Macho

“He’s coming ic get you. . . .
He's waiting ‘til you pass out
and then he’s going to scoop out
your spleen and lacerate your
kidneys. . . . ." I taunted.

”God damn you, you'll rot in
hell for this. . . . What a thing
to lay on someone with a head
twisted by acid and a Case of
Coors. . .

"Serves you right for drinking
that fascist swill. . .and watch
your language; I’ll have you
know I’m a good Christian and
won't have you taking the name
of Lhe Lord in vain. And what a
dumb thing to do, anyway,
watching a hellish movie like
Nightmare on Elm Street while
tripping heavily. You should
have Just Said No to drugs."

He responded with
indecipherable obseenities and
gibberish. Boy, he was nearly
foaming at the mouth. That
windowpane is powerful stuff.
We were lurching around campus
for no particular reason (we had a
reason at the time, and it seemed
a very good one to us, I’m sure)
after watching a videotape of
Nightmare on Elm Street, which
freaked us right out. It‘s about
this evil killer, Freddy, who
mmdeml children and was burned
to death by a mob of angry
parents, only to return more
powerful than ever to haunt
teenagers in their dreams and kill

them with this nifty glove with
blades attached to the fingeis.

There’s some pretty standard
horror stuff (a gang of teens
hunted down by an unstoppable
killer, one remains and S/he’s
determined to end the reign of
leiroi, bla bla bla.) but it's pretty
well done. It WILL scare the shit
out of the squeamish and provide
a gorei’esi to satisfy the most
bloodthirsty fans of senseless
violence. There's also some
interesting psychodrama as the
dream world Freddy rules collides
with reality (reminds me of “The
Double" by Dostoevsky). There
are some good special effects,
too, and sufficient suspense,
tension, fear, ct celera.

Which explains why I was
wandering around campus with a
clearly deranged drug ﬁend prone
to screaming fits. Or does it?
What a wimp. Some acid and he
freaks out at a little scary movie.
Then I remembered my own
hellish odyssey with the mesca-
line and the Clockwork Orange/
Apocalypse Now double feature,
and shuddercd. Yeah, this could
make a certifiablc lunatic out of
the most stable preppie young
Republican, But isn't that what
our Grinnell Experience is all
about?

The Falcon and the Snowman: an oversimplified
look at complex case

by Dan Capone

The Falcon and the Snowman
is the story of Christopher Boyce
and Daulton Lee, children of the
sixties who became two of the
unlikeliest spies of the sevenLies,
selling national secrets to the
KGB. Director John Schlesinger
says that he is not so interested

in telling what happened, as he is_

in looking at why it happened.
However, in doing so he grossly
oversimplifics matters.

Boyce and Lee (played by
Timothy Hutton and Sean Penn)
were boyhood friends, They were
parochialrschool pupils, who
served mass as altar boys
together, became good friends on
the high-school football team,
and developed an interest in
falconry, Boyce went to
seminary, dropped out, went to
college, and in July 1974, decided
to take some time off. Lee in the
meanwhile, had gotten heavily
involved with heroin and coke,
both dealing and using, and was
on probation.

During his time off from
school, Boyce got a high-security
job at the TRW defense plant,
through his father. At his job,
Boyce becomes shocked to learn
of the CIA's heavy involvement
and interference in the internal
affairs of other countries. He is
so appalled at the extent of the

Private Benjamin

One of the big box-office hiLs
of 1980, Howard Zieff’s Private
Benjamin stars Goldie Hawn as
Judy Benjamin. Benjamin is a
rich, spoiled Philadelphia girl
who is widowed on her wedding
night when her second husband
dies on the bathroom lloor. In
mourning all that she could have
had, she joins the army. Duped
by her recruiter, she arrives for
basic training expecting more of
the rich life. However, the world
in Biloxi, Miss. isn‘t
conominuims and yachts. The
rest of the film is just the
flcsliing out of this cut-and-pastc
plot, written by Nancy Meyers,
Charles Sliyer, unti Harvey
Miller.

manipulations of the CIA, at the
duplicity of the government, that
he decides to pass on toprseei‘et
military satellite secrets to the
Soviets. Lee figures in as an
accomplice and courier to the
Soviet embassy in Mexico City.
This selling of secrets went on
for some time, until Lee was
arrested in January 1977 for cre-
ating a disturbance outside the
Soviet embassy. Ten days later,
Boyce, who was now back in
college, was picked up.
Schlesinger, in his getting at
the why, not the what. leaves out
or only alludes to several key
specifics. What is going on is
not clear to the viewer. Without
being sure of what went on, it is

much harder, if not impossible,
to understand the why. But
Schlesinger does such a muddled
job exploring Boyce and Lee’s
motives that this never becomes
a major problem, just an
annoyance.

Lee is portrayed as a greedy
dope dealer, who clearly became
involved for the ﬁnancial rewards
he stood to gain. Penn does a
good job with his role,
disappearing into it, becoming
the creep, rather than portraying
him. Hutton plays Boyce as a
sensitive, sympathetic, troubled

hero who has gotten in too deep.
However, the later facts of
history show that Boyce is a
much more complex character
(Boyce escaped from prison and
robbed banks, before again being
apprehended).

To these oversimplifieaiions
of the individual characters, there
are larger issues that aren‘t really
looked at. The relationship
between Lee and Boyce is never
really established or explored,
just as the importance of falconry
to the whole situation is largely
left untouched. Boyce’s disil-
lusionment is made readily un-
derstandable, but the jump from
this disillusionment to selling
secrets to the Soviets is not
explained. But then, perhaps,
that is far away from
Schlesinger’s real goals after all.
It seems that Schlesinger had
already decided what the why was,
and that rather than Lry to discern
the truth from the facts, he has
tried to arrange the details and
facts of the case, leaving out and
unexplored those areas which do
not support his already~arrivedrat
conclusion: that the CIA's. not
Boyce's. actions were the
lraitorous ones; that Boycc's
actions werejustiﬁed.

Coming to America: a
new Eddie Murphy?

Coming to America shows us
Eddie Murphy in a whole new
light, very different from the
Beverly Hills Cop mOVICS or The
Golden Child The film is a
sweet, slowrpaced fairy tale
Prince Akcem (Murphy) is the 2
year old heir to the mythic:
African kingdom of Zamund:
smothered and bOXCLi’m by if
life of priviledge he leads. Whe
his father arranges his marriage u
a scrvile young bride, he rejects
her and sets off for America with
his best friend, Semmi (Arsenio
Hall), to find a bride who can
think for herself, He finds her in
Queens, in Lisa McDowell (Shari
Headlcy), daughter of a fast-food
restauranlecr.

The film is interesting in that
Murphy here is trying hard to
reposition himself, changing lllN
image. Hc sheds tllc usual

hostile, paranord treatment of
wolnen found in his comedy
routines, trying to present
himself as a sort of prorfeminist.
Along with the slow pace of the
film, Murphy's role is unusually
subdued and rcsuaincd, although a
more characteristic Murphy
comes out in three small roles
that he also plays (those of a
barber, a singer, and an old
Jewish man), Hall, too, gets to
play multiple roles in the ﬁlm.

So the question that comes
out of the film is, how sincere is
it. Sure its enjoyable comedy,
but is the underlying purpose of
the film accepted? Just because .
it’s said, doesn't mean it's so.
Remember, this film is, first and
foremost, a fairy ulle.
