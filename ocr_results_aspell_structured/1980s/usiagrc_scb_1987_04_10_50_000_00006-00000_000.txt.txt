don’t see

For all who might not otherwise
know, this weekend it a prospective
studenls’ weekend. Today and tomor-
row, the college will bulge with recently
accepted students who are anxiotts lry-
ing to decide whether to atlend Gritt-
nell or Carleton, Lawrence, Kenyon, or
Oberlin. Some will came with their
parents in tow, and others will come
alone. but all will be very excited and
eager to see the difference between the
critmell presented in the oiewbookt
and Grinnell as it actually is. Unfor-
tunately, many of these prospective
students will not be on campus long
enough really to ice all of Grinnell (‘0!-
lege’s unsightly blemishes.

It is loo bad that most of what apro-
lpectiue student sees during a visit to
Grinnell College it how “comfy" the
library is and “cool" the students are
sitting in the Min on the Forum beach.
This is not surprising: after all, the
library and the Forum beach make
Grinnell look like a “great" colleges
Alas, Grinnell is not what it appear: to
be.

During a prospective weekend, it
would not be surprising for a visitor to
think of Grinnell a. a great liberal in-
ut'tltlion with o zeal for creativity. of
course during a tour of the campus,
lltudenla will be shown the Fine Art:
building and will be told of the great
finearu courres at arirtttell and of
course, of the Mirecourt Trio. Prospec-
live students might not understand that
the fine-arts deparlmenhz are con-
tideretl by many Grinnell students to
be atnottg the weakest departments on
rumpus. Moreover, prospective
students might not know how the ad-
ministration has neglected thcjine-arts
department while strongly supporting
the sciences.

Of course, this weekend, prospective
students will be shown the observatory
and lite eleclron microscope, but what
they will not see is how the three posi—
lianst in the music department are
taken by the Mirecourt Trio (artists-in.
reridencc), who act as public relations
representatires ofthe college while also
attempting to teach music counetn lu‘
fact, it it ttot uncommon for members
of the Mirecourl Trio lo miss three or
more weeks of class due to concert
engagements during the course of a
semesterl

At the, and oft! prospective weekend,
many studenu leave (.‘rinnell thinking
this is a great liberal-arts college. Many
of them go home and tell their parents
that Crinnell is worth $12,000 utlll

A journal by Robert Fein

When I travel by bus, I usually have the
misfnrtune to Sit next in someone who
either listens to a Walkman or who falls
asleep on my shoulder — one or the other,
When I lell campus on Friday, March 13
to Sing in the Twin Cities with the Grinnell
Singers under James Fudge, I had the
displeasure of sitting next to Someone who
did both. She was slumped against me,
snoring, and the music coming from her
headphones was loud enough for me to be
able to hear it, yet [Do salt for me to be able
to make out the tune. It was just loud
enough to drive me completely insane durr
ing the lhreehour drive to Webster City,
Iowa,

The vehicle that we were traveling in
was a technological marvel. It's Called a
“minibus" and looks like an overweight

"Niggmes,"

The following morning the Ryherds
prayed before breaklast. It was a long
prayer and 1 don’t remember it, but I do
remember that I said “Amen” alter it with
Lhem * not that Jewlsh “Ah-men“ I had
been reared on, either, but a good Chris
tian “Ay-men." And so I began a week-
long lantasy that I was not a New York
Jew after all, but that I was, in fact, an
American WASP. I longed lﬂr a thrilling
llirl with mainstream, American religious
culture. Over the course ol the week, I was
to eat and sing in churches, pray belore
potluck dinners and belt oul. benedictions

people, I am a WASP, lam a WASP," but
it didn't Work. I remain an oulsider.

On Sunday we lound ourselves in St.

coast of America, it’s not really part of the
continental, U.S. So now, finally, 1 could

get in touch with real America, the midwest."

 

white van. The thing is one solid piece of
molded plastic — no seams, anywhere.
From the inside, it looked like one of those
contoured, plastic tubs that builders plop
into homes nowadays. And this pre—lab,
rolling chunk of plasiic’ had the words
”Grinell College" painted on ﬁle sidq
beneath an old. outdated logo. Nu one knew
what to call it. The “Grinnellmoblle” and
the “Space Shuttle" were names that jusl.
didn't stick.

Our ﬁrst. Slop on tour was the United
Church of Christ in Webster City, which we
were to sing at that lust Friday night. The
contoured, plastic minibus vomited us out
at the church and were served a potluck
dinner cooked by the townspeople who
would be housing us that night alter our
concert. Now, I thought that slaying in
peoples‘ homes was going to be just great
for me, because the Whole time I figured
that finally I could get in touch wlih the
“American spirit." lhad grown up in New
York City. and never l'el'. that I had grown
up in the United States. You know,
Manhattan is an Island all the coast of
America, it’s not really part at the cone
[mental U.S. So now, finally. I could get in
touch with the real America, the Midwest.

The ﬁrst night all, I was subjected to the
Mtdwesterncr's typical anti-urban comr
menlary. Al the church’s pot-luck dinner, I
Sal. across the table from a man who
sounded like Ralph the Dog lrom the Mup-
pets, He told me to get up and get seconds
from the counter across the room, and
when I declined, he said in his grull Ralph-
tthbg voice, “Why, it you were back
home In New York City you’d be up there
pushln' and shovin’ and lighlln' lor all the
food." The veins in his neck were really
popping out, “Oh, no? Tell me you
wouldn't be up there lighting With all the
rest at 'em." I had somehow enraged an
Iowan. and already, the wheels on the hair
tom of my suitcase were beginning to Show
signs or serious wear, The bad omens were
really piling up.

After our concert that night, Rick Earl
and I Stayed in the home of Dan and Donna
Ryherd. We‘whlled away the evening by
inlerrogalmg lhe couple about their ex-
periences as Peace Corps volunteers in the
South Pacific. Donna had spent most of her
time there on Nut trying to Convince the
islanders that having chickens pecklng at
one's dinner was not. a good thing. Don
gave us a short anthropology lesson and
compared the islandcl‘s' skin colur to that
ol “the American Niggroes." Thal‘s just
the way he Said it, in his slow, soil voice:

Paul, Minnesota, another city with one of
those wimp “skywalk” systems conneCr
ling buildings. We were to smg durlng the
two morning services at the opulent House
of Hope Presbyterian Church, which
reminded me of a few dormitories I had
seen at Yale. It looked more llke a
cathedral, with a wooden vaulted ceiling of
a rlch, mahogany color, The place was rill-
ed with families all in their Sunday best,
men with dark suns and Carnations in the
lapels, everyone immaculate and spotless
and much too cleanrcul. And I kept [hinkr
ing: Who are these people? Everyone
looked 99 and ill/local, pure, so spotless
they could have stepped right on a douche
ad on TV, I grew up in New York. where
everyone is pushy. hairy and perpetually
sweaty. Synagogue fashion was a shirt a
few sizes [00 small and a jacket that didn't
match the stained lie.

A lormal service like theirs is much
more fun when observed from behind the
scenes, because it loses all of its dignity,
From our vantage point of the pews In the
chancel, we watched the altar boys Slickr
ing their tongues out at one another and
giggling. During the sermon, a minister
with a lace or carved granite, sitting
across from us, worked at a Crossword
puzzle and let out magniltcent yawns. And
getting close to him, I could see he was
wearing a little remote microphone, just
like Oprah wmlrcy.

That Sunday afternoon we arrived (or
the ﬁrst time at the home of one ol our
Sopranos, Kim Lanegran. This staid. house
beautiful, better home and garden was i0
become our chtel poinl. of invaston. Every
day, 25 twinks would trump through the
front dour without bothering to knock,
track mud all over their white rug and plop
down into their white Chairs. We would
throw our [eel up onto their collee table,
devour the food that they would cook us,
drip home-cdoked chill (the kind with
black olives floating in |l.l onto their ﬂoor,
break dining room chairs and get crumbs
under the rug. And meanwhile, the
Lanegrans would be involved in a futile el-
lorl lo Continue leading their own llves
under the occupying inrccs Eventually.
[he giant plaslic mlnlbus would whisk us
away to some church somewhere, giving
Mrs. Lanegran just enough time It) wipe
the last bits of Chlll all the manlelplece
before we would be back lo break more
chairs.

There In St. Paul. I stayed in [be home of
.leunnc Fischer, a quickrwilled, eccentric
old lady who revlewed books for a local

newspaper. She had a sure walk, a gravel-
ly voice and a wry Sense or humor, and I
could tell She was a liberal because she
wasn't saying ‘Niggroes," but “blacks,"
She said, “I am a verllable lund of infor
mallon and some of it ls even true,” so I
don't know whether She was telling the
truth when she told me how she and her
lricnds amused themselves by planting
plastic, pink flamingos on the lawns oi
mansions al 3 A.M Staying with her was
like being back in Grandma Helen's house
in the Bronx: muffins for breakfast, halfr
and-halt poured onto my cereal out at a
small silver creamer.

And so finally I had gotten in touch with
the real American spirit in the Midwest,
and what I found was that Americans are
religious extremists. Don’t tell me about
Shiites, Middle-East militiamen or Irar
nians. American 5 are religious ex»
tremisls. Take Iowa. which is called “the
Bible Slate.” You know who calls it “the
Bible Slate”? Only Iowans do, which gives
you an idea of the situation. I have stayed
in homes with Bibles sprinkled liberally
about, with the Situation particularly acute
in a house in St, Cloud, where a truly mam-
moth copy 7 I‘d never seen a bigger one
,Sai on a table outside my door. “The Liv»
ing Bible,” it said. If ll. fell on you, you'd be
killed on the spot. Best of all were the elec-
tric bank signs in northern Iowa towns —
towns with churches on every corner, en
tire blocks of churches * bank Signs that
flashed, “2 PM..,53“..,Jesus Saves...2
PM,..53 Jesus Saves... ' The name of
God is o the dollar blll, in the national an,
them, ln megaBlbles in SLCloud, in lights
on bank signs and In hall the songs the
Grinnell Singers periormed on tour.

Al firs! I couldn't understand why the
college was going to pay tor this whale
thing 7 our meals, our bus, a hotel stay. I
had gone on tour with choruses before and
always had paid my own way. But
everything snapped into locus when I read
the itinerary; half of our concerts were in
high schools. Why didn't we sing at
Macalesler College in St, Paul instead of al.
Sayzata High School, or at Carleton in»
stead of Edlna High School? Think about
