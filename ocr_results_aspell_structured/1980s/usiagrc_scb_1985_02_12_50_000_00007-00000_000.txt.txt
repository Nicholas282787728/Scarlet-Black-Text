-a Strauber, associate Protessor oi
Political Science, addressed Grinnell
students last Wednesday at the weekly
Moirtar Board Hours in South Lounge. The
title at Strauber’s talk wa “Roe vs. Wade
7 Was it the Right Decision?"
s.trauber prelaced his remarks with the
tatement that he did not intend to con-
vince his audience oi his position. but
rather to provoke a discussion because or
hecontroversiality or his topic.

’Fhe Roe VS Wade was controversial in
tw ways. began Strauber, constitutional-
ly. and morally. Furthermore. he can

. ued. the constitutional interpretation of

the law was basically a moral interpreta-
tiun. From the moral standpoint there
were two issues at han The right of one
to control one's own body. and the rights or
the tetus. Strauber stated emphatically,
"neither moral position is sufficient nor
adequate" when reaching the verdict in
the Roe case. The moral rights are not per
tirtent in determining whether abortion is
legal or illegal. Strauber asserted.

The protessor paused to clarify his
definition of the word ”right," There are
no‘moral rights. he stated, but political
ri hts, He made a distinction between
ine's believing one has the right to an
.bortion because one sees it morally perr
mlssable. and one's having an absolute
antral over one’s body,

One has rights as a member of a social
nganization. not as an individual. actor»
rig to Strauber. Those rights are not
moral, but they are political: they exist

because they have been granted by some
power that deemed them reasonable. Thus
the only rights that one has. contended
Strauber. are those rights that have been
granted to society, Strauber recognized
that his suppositions made him vulnerable
to attacks. particularily by Marxists and
Radical Feminists, He Said that they
would take issue with him as a “liberal-
democratic bourgeois capitalistic pig.”
The Chief implication Elf his statements.
Strauber pointed out, was that “abortion is
not a moral issue." it is a political issue.

Strauber says

based on the rights that one has been
granted

Strauber said that. in his opinion. the
verdict in the Roe vs, Wade case was the
right decision The iudgment permitted
women to have abortions. but as the
pregnancy came closer to term, he said,
the state was given the right to intervene
as the health of the mother. and the Sur-
vival of the fetus became more of an issuer
Strauber delended his position by stating
that according to commonrlaw, states
have the responsibility to insure and pro
tect the health of its citizens. Thus. in some
cases State intervention into the Woman’s
decision is warranted and justifiable. He
then paused to point out that 90% of abor-
tions are performed within the first 12
weeks or pregnancy, the time during which
the state cannot intervene.

The power tor intervention is the “police
power” of commoniaw. it is the common.
law that determines the rights at the pear
pie. Strauber's iinai statement belore he
opened the tloor for questions was that
rights are not absolute, and state interven-
tion is warranted when the health oi one or
its citizens is in jeopardy.

Strauber responded to several questions
from the floor before concluding his
remarks with the statement that he believ-
ed the decision of Roe vs. Wade would be
upheld. despite all the controversy, mainly
because ol the dangerous consequences
that would result with the prohibition of
abortion.
