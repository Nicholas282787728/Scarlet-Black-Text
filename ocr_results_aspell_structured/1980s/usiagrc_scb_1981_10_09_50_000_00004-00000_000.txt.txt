“A sorrowrul lesson

The death of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat is both sad and tragic
for many reasons. Yet in all the analysis that is taking place about what
will happen in the Middle East, one aspect of Sadat‘s death seems to be
overlooked; a human being has been murdered.

The national press is full of reports on how his death will affect the
fragile peace that now struggles for life in the Mid-East and how U.S.
government officials have expressed concern for the future of American
policy there. But few if any reports seem to deal with the death on its
most basic level. That is, the press is ignoring the fact that a man has
been murdered in order for an opposing group to make its feelings
knowno

Hundreds of people are killed everyday around the world, so maybe
we are becoming immune to the real value of life. But when a man like
Sadat is murdered it shows just how much value one life can have. Sadat
represented stability in an explosive part of the world and with his
senseless death all the good he strove to achieve will probably fail to be
realized.

If there is any lesson to be learned from this event, it is a clearer
understanding of the real value of life.

'11] Sltlll or not It] Skill 7

To skip or not to skip? That was the question students were forced to
answer last Thursday as once again the SGA sponsored the traditional
fall Skip Day. Well, from the looks of the turnout in Darby it seems that
most of the student body opted out of joining the activities instead of op
ting out of classes.

Many students said that they would have liked to join the party but
that the timing of Skip Day just didn’t work out for them. That sounds
like a convenient excuse to us. Skip Day, whenever you schedule it, will
always be poorly timed for a set group of students. We don’t think the
SGA should have to take much blame for that 7 the leaders picked what
they thought would he the lightest academic day for the greatest
number of students. .

The question is whether or not we should have a day set aside just for
the express idea of missing classes. We believe that this is an idea that is
no longer supported by the majority of the students

The problem with Skip Day lies in the concept itself Skip Day is a
hold—over from a different Grinnell, a Grinnell that had a student body
that was much move involved and concerned with national issues and
showing their defiance for things they felt were wrong. More important
ly, it was a Grinnell whose faculty supported the student’s overt expres-
sion of defiance and a faculty who supported Skip Day. Who knows,
maybe they felt Skip Day was the kind of event that a school with its own
“experience” should be sponsoring. Maybe, they felt that Skip Day ac
tivities were important in developing the liberally educated student.

But Grinnell’s present faculty obviously doesn’t believe this to be the
case and without faculty support Skip Day is doomed to failure.

Skip Day is a tradition that has died but the tradition of the Grinnell
Relays lives on. Last year we saw what a lot of organization and plann-
ing could achieve — a good time. Let’s let Skip Day die an uneventful
death and use the money that went into Skip Day towards making the
Relays a bigger and better event.

Two million dollars is a lot of money, so
when my editor asked me ror my ideas on
how to Spend the trustees' “surplus" I was
quite llaltered with the responsibility
bestowed upon me. 1 can spend money like
a drunken sailor but a sum at such
magnitude can humble even a spendthrift
of my caliber. Ever mindul of the duty and
responsibility involved in making such
recommendations and with an eye toward
the best interests of the college I present
my proposals

There are two ways to spend the money'
i) invest it and just spend the interest trom
year to year or 2) spend the whole sum at
once. I have ideas for both options:

if the trustees invest the money and, for
the sake or argument. they can do as well
as SGA does with its investments, we will
have about $340,000a year to spend, 1 think
we should give the whole $330,000 to Food
Service with two stipulations: 1) $40,000
to be spent to augment what is currently
spent on food for better food: better cuts of
meat, less watery soda, rcal pasta, etc 2)
The remaining $200,000 to be divided into
two $100,000 salaries to pay two or the
finest chefs in the nation to he hired to cook
in Quad and Cowles.

Armies are not the only things that run
on their stomachs; students do too. How
are we supposed to live up to our potential
brilliance existing solely on peanut butter?
These chefs could train the current kitchen
staffs during the breaks and dream up
fantastic meals to serve us The argument
that FOG food is bad because it is difficult
to cook for 1,200 is hogwash Each kitchen
only has to cook for 500 and cooking ror 500
is not hard at all; the finest restaurants do
it cvery night. The best restaurants not
only have to cook for a lot oi people, they
have to he prepared to cook anything on
the menu at short notice 0iir cooks only
have to cook two or three items and get
most or the day to prepare them. The two
chefs we hire will be able to bring
restaurant quality and eiliciency to FOG

.nnd wcwill get to eat something other than
hot dogs and tried tlsh

We can also take that $200000 and divide
II by so (the number of weeks we are at
Grinncll) and hire '30 of America's finest
chefs to visit and cook for a week each, We
would have a little over 50.600 a week to
spend on each orthese guys and they would
bringa dclightlul change to our boring and
mundane menu.

or course, wc may not want to invest the
money but blow the whole thing at one
time. I think that it we deCide to go this

have read the article presented in last
week’s 8&8 concerning the changingoi the

theme It seems that a small faction of
students on campus thought the sign said

arguments" which don't satisfy the op

argument will.

First of all. the present name does

inherent evils in the title call for a

preceeding query, we must delve into the
true origins or the Gang Bang and the
connotations which have evolved from
them, In 1973, the Gang Bang was
originally named on the James Gang, a
goup orearly American gun toting rowdies

complete the title because it does rhyme
With “gang“ and becausethe word “bang”
means ”a sudden burst of action" and “a
