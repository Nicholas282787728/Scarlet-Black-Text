Rumor of .
bookStoro’s

profits dispute

by Julie Slivinsky

After buying ﬁrst semester's
books and other su plies, many
students wondererF just how
umch protit the college book
store makes from students. The
Scarlet and Black spoke ror
many students last week when
the editorial page questioned the
hike in laundry-chip price. Al-
though prices may seem high at
times, the bookstore “is on a
brzak-cven-plus basis," accords

llavin this selection if we wire
in it or the proﬁt.”

Even the iterus on the top ﬂoor
of the store such as T-shirts
and personal products, do not
make nurch proﬁt in the end,
says Mcsee. There is a set
mark-up, ruuch like any conve-
nience store, but MrBee says,
“It's probably less than ruany
other stores. And we probably
don't make any money on tcxte

”We couldn'tjustijy having this selection
if we were in it for the proﬁtf’says
manager Tom McBee.

 

iug to manager Torn MeDce.
“It's not set up to make a large
proht £or the college."

Any money the bookstore may
make is funneled into Student
Affairs or else used to stock up
the bookstore's extensive none
textbook department. MrBee
calls the 15,000 to lb’,000»title
book dc artmeut “one of the
best in tie eouutry tor a school
this size. We couldn't justify

books. Also, havin more proﬁt
in the to part oftre store in a
way subsidies having a book de-
Vpnrtlnent."

The money for the reccnt rciir
ovations in the bookstore came
from the gcncral fund, as would
money tor renovation of any
other campus building, not from
the raise in the laulltlryrchip
price.
