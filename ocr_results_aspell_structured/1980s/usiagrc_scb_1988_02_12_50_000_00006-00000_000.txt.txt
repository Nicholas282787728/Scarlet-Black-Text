Influencing Grinnell’s
Future

Today marks the date ol an event which, although not as tabled in Grinnell Col-
lege lore as Wayne Moyer's Relays, has a prolound etlect on all aspects ol student as
well as taculty and administrative lie: the day the trustees came to town.

The ettects that this meeting will have on the college community are immense.
Although the trustees' liuance committee came here with the 191839 trudget
already set, its approval today tixes in stone Grinnell’s expenses and revenue tor the
next academic year. Among the expenses the college will have is a nine-told per-
cent increase in taculty salaries. According to President George Drake, this increase
linally brings Grinnell’s laculty salaries i to line witti those ot the colleges we like to
compare ourselves with. That is the positive side at the 1988-89 budget — the ex-
penses. The negative side at the budget comes on the other hall of the balance
sheet — the revenue. Once again, tuition will be increased, this time by approx-
imately eight percent

Despite all the pluses and minuses included in the budget. the most inlluential
part is what will not be included: there will be no money in the budget tor increasr
ed laculty, This will have a major impact on the campus. tlext Monday, the laculty
will in all likelihood vote to move to a 3-2 teaching load next semester. Faculty will
theretore teach only live courses a year rather than the six they presently teach.
Without an increase in the number at taculty, this change will result in class sizes
increasing on the average by three to tour students. No such increase seems in the
wortu tor at least a year.

While most students will not even see the trustees during their stay, let alone have
any input into decision-making, students' concerns have been conveyed to the
trustees In a letter to the trustees the Student Govemmenl Asociation loint Board
expressed its dissatisfaction with the tuition increase as well as the situation involv~
ing the move to the M leaching load. in the letter. 56A states that it is "concerned
that student interests are not being adequately considered in the plans tor next
year’s curriculum. Speciﬁcally, we leel that the laculty' ‘mpending decision to
reduce its teaching load, coupled with the trustees' decision to hold the line on
laculty increase, is an unlair combination." This letter was sent to all at the
trustees as well as the laculty. Drake, and Wally Walker.

The reality at this whole situation is that there is almost nothing the student body
can do to prevent any at these measures trom going into eltect. What will happen
next year has already been decided. Much can still be done, however, to intluence
what will happen in Grinnell's luture.

Standing up for righteous causes in the heat at battle is a Grinnell trademark. Un~
loitunately, so is sitting down after the tight loses its excitement. The storms ot pas
siouate involvement that led to the Speakeasy and the core curriculum debate left
tidal waves ol apathy in their wake. Too otten, in these examples and in others,
students react to the short term instead ot acting over the long term. Not enough
energy is being locused on the long-run interests at Grinnell students. Last Monday
night. over 600 people packed into Fairview School to take part in the Democratic
party's caucus. Two weeks ago SGA literally had to beg students to run in the Joint
lloard elections. The application deadline had to be extended because only 10
statements at intent were received before the original deadline passed.

Furthering the interests at students is not an easy task. This college is set up so
that the students have almos1 no lormal input into what goes on in the curriculum
and in other matters. This makes it just that much more important that Grinnell
students get involved and stay involved in campus issues. The laculty and ad»
ministration will not just give students the right to play a role in college policies;
students must ask lor it. Despite how they are often perceived, the taculty and ad

ministration are in most instances very willing to answer any questions students

have about campus issues. It you see or hear something that irritates you or that you
have questions about, ask the administration about it. A large part at their job
should be responding to students' concerns But they will not respond unle§ you
ask them.

Reader Refutes Lohaus’

Arguements

To the Editor:

I would like to begin this letter by
stating my disappointment that
non-Christians and Christians such
as Bill Lohaus are ever turned
away irom the idea oi Christianity
by individuals, Mr. Lohaus calls
them “tundamentalists,” who are
in some sense trying to do the op
posite. ii is unfortunately 3 toe: in
this day or televangelism that
Christianity is given a bad name
by individual members oi the
Church who lail to express the true
spirit (Spiritl ol the Bible And
judging by some or the statements
made by Mr. bohaus, he seems to
have gotten the wrong idea about
various issues such as the Chinese,
salvation and following God's law.
While l'm not a tundamentalisl. by
detlnition, and there are in tact
criteria to be met in labeling
oneself fundamentalist LI am not a
believer in creation science), I feel
compelled at least to try to Clear up
some misunderstanding with
regard to Mr. Lohaus' article.

The first thing I would like to
make clear IS that, as Mr, Lohaus
says, we shouldn't thrash a posr
tion because oi the proponent oi
that position. For example, ii 1
state that “Adolt Hitler was a
Christian carrying out Christian
tasks in his most notorious crimes
against humanity," as Hitler
himself said. I am stating
something different from “Adolf
Hitler believed he was a Christian
carrying out. My point oicourse
is that the standards of the Bible
should be equated only with those
individuals who abide by Biblical
principles. Mr. Lohaus describes a
particular fundamentalist as being
“simplistic" in his beliefs, “selfr
righteous." and “arrogant." and
we may readily infer that this tun»
damentalist was damned in his
conviction. it Mr. Lohaus is cor-
rect in his Characterization, then i
as a Christian would agree not to
“go along with them." However, 1
would not be denying a literal in-
terprelation oi the Bible ii i did not
go along with an individual who
possessed these characteristics. 1
would in tact be following the prin-
ciples oi the New Testament. What
I want Mr. Lohaus and others to
understand, and i don't suggest
that he doesn‘t necessarily unders~
tand this. is that one of the most
highly stressed principles in the
New Tescarncnt is that at humility.
In fact, the Genesis story beaches
that man’s downfall was due to his
pride, his desire to be like God. Sol
suggest that Mr. Lohaus didn't acr
tually encounter the Word of God
on that fateful night last spring.

But there is something disturb»
ing in Mr. Lohaus' View oi certain
issues. 1 would like to suggest that
anyone who presumes to speak or
what Christianity has to otter,
especially at. a theological level,
should make themselves aware of
what the Bible states For exam-

ple, while i appreciate Mr. Lohaus’

liberal ideas about religion as ex
pressed in the last paragraphs or
his article, he might or might not
be surprised to know that tby
deiinitioni Christians, by way or
their faith that the Bible is the
Word ot God, and torced into a
very radical position, Christ said
that the one who is not [or Him is
against Him. The God oi Chris-
tianlty also promises heaven and
hell depending upon one's belief.
For Christians (by definition)
there is only one true religion. or
course that idea IS radical and
perhaps unpopular at a place like
Grinnell. There‘s nothing wishy-
washy about true Christianity As
for the Chinese. and all others who
lime never encountered the Word
or Goil. ii Mr. Lohaus would read
the second chapter of Paul's letter
to the Romans, he would see that
Christianity, if not the individual
he talked to, has a place in heaven
ior all people who are worthy,

One or the irequeni ditiiculticsl
have seen when someone tries to
teach the Gospel of Jesus Christ is
that people too oilen accuse the
Christian of being condemning.
But oi course it is God that set up
the principles and it is only He, ac»
cording to the Christian tradition,
who shall pass judgement. Mr,
Lohaus remarks that he is irked by
fundamentalists who draw distinc-
tions between “good" and believe
ing Christians and “good” and non-
believing indiVlduals. But oi
course it is God who draws that
distinction,‘ Personally, I couldn'l
send anyone to an eternal “hell.”
But as a Christian. I have bought
into a religion that has such an oulr
come. I would be inconsistent were
1 to make the claim that I am a
Christian and then claim that
God's distinctions don't apply.
About this I should say that Chris
tianity teaches by way oi Paul's
