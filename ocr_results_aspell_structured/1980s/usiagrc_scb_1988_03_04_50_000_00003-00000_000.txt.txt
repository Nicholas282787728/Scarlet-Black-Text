“We are ‘well-woman’-oriented,
We want to prevent things rather
than cure things,” said Joyce
Breune, one of the two nurse pracr
titioners of the Central Iowa Famir
ly Planning Clinic in Grinnell.

The clinic, open since January
21, 1938, is the only service in the
area administering gynecological
care exclusively by and for
women, such as general examina-
tions. pelvic exams and Pap
smears, sexually-transmitted
disease counseling, and birth-
control advice and contraceptive
dispension.

The clinic offers facilities for
women from live counties:
Poweshiek, Marshall. Grundy,
liarden, and Tania, and is a
branch clinic of the Central Iowa
Family Planning Clinic in Mar-
shalltown. But while Workers at
the clinic feel that. there are an
equal number of area women and
students from the college using the
clinic in town, there has been a
nominal amount of inquiries and
referrals through the campus
health center since the beginning
at the semester. Donna Bailey, the
head nurse of the college's health
center. said the students who have
taken advantage of the clinic's ser»
vices have had a positive feeling
toward the clinic. “I would think
mat the women [on campusl would
be happy to see a female examiner
in town," said Bailey,

“From what I hear, [the clinic]
is more thorough than any doctors
in town.” said Sally, a student on
campus who is a client of the Fami-
ly Planning Clinic. Sally originally
called the health center to find out
where she could go for an examiner
tion. The nurses who Work at the
health center recommended the
clinic.

The health center can assist in
making appointments at the clinic,

Twelve of the brightest minds in the country had the same idea

last summer.

Health Care for Women

but the college does not provide
transportation to it because of its
proximity to the school,

Neither Grinnell nor the surroun»
ding area has a gynecologist. it
was a policy at one time for the
health center to refer women to
one of the general practitioners in
town, all or whom are men. If the
general practitioner believed there
was a more serious problem that
he could not address, he referred
the patient to a gynecologist in Des
Moines, lowa City, or elsewhere.
“The general consensus is that
Grinnell is too small for an
obstetrician-gynecologist," said
Bailey.

While the town itself has no
gynecologists. the clinic employs
female nurse practitioners whose
main priority is women's health
care. No one at the clinic, however,
practices medicine If a specific
problem is beyond the clinic’s
capabilities [or treatment, the pa~
tient is advised to see her family
physician or is urged to see
another doctor.

For some women, the main ad-
vantage ot having examinations at
the clinic is that the exam is per-
lormed by a woman. A typical visit
to the clinic involves checking the
client’s weight. height, and blood
pressure. The nurse practitioner
does a hematocrit test, which in
volves taking a small amount of
blood lrom the patient to check for
an iron deficiency. The patient has
a urine test done to check the
amount oi protein and glucose in
the urine and to detect it there are
kidney problems and diabetes. In-
lormation about iron levels and
glucose production in the body is
important for the patient to know it

pills. if she has too much iron in
her blood, taking birth-control pills
could cause blood clots in her limbs

tioner sees any reason. Then the

amined, as well as the abdomen

While on the examining table,
the nurse practitioner performs a
breast examination for breast
cancer and shows the patient how

examination. she expands the cer-
vix by placing a long plastic prong
known as a spatulate inside the
cervix and obtains a smear from
the cervix. The smear is placed on
a slide for microscopic examina-
tion. Examining the slide does not
take place in the clinic itselt; in
stead, the slide is sent to a cytology

Then, a pelvic exam is done as the
nurse practitioner talks to the pa
tient. If the patient so desires, the
nurse practitioner lets her use a
mirror to see exactly what is being
checked for and how the examina
tion is done. This procedure is
something rarely done during most
other examinations. “It takes the
tear away from what's going on."
said Brueneo

The pelvic exam follows. It in-
volves the examiner's placing two
fingers inside the patient's vagina
and examining the vagina and

’Some students on campus who
had had the test done felt uneasy
not knowing exactly what would
happen to their gonorrhea test
results, or even how the results are
obtained. This infomation is stated
on all consent iorms that must be
signed betore any examination can
be done, Yet. for some unknown

doesn't want the test taken, she
will still be given the other
gynecological examinations. She
will also be counseled as to why it
is important to have the test taken.

“I think it protects the health of
the community" to have a gonorv
rhea test done, said senior Kimber-
ly Townshend. “when you’re
testing tor a communicable
disease, it helps to protect the
health of everyone It's especially
important lol- women [to have the
test taken] because a lot of times
they don't even know they have
Igonorrheal," said Townshend. In
fact, statistics from the book “The
New Our Bodies, Ourselves"
reveal that 40 to on percent of peo-
ple with gonorrhea never have the
symptoms or might coniuse the
symptoms with other vaginal
diseases. Moreover, it is not until
gonorrhea spreads to the fallopian
tubes and to the uterus that pain
develops. One result of untreated
gonorrhea is infertility.

In addition to sexually-
transmitted-disease counseling
