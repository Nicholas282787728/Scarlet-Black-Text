WARNING: Some songs on the album
SONG X by Pat Metheny and Ornette Cole
eman are not for the weak of heart! This is
free jazz, kids and if you re not serious
about your music. you might miss
something great. Saxophonist Coleman
and guitarist Metheny, along with bassist
Charlie Haden and drummers Jack De-
jnhnette and Denardo Coleman, have adds
ed an exciting couple of tracks to the
catalogues of free jazz that contain some
great licks from both of these great in
strumentalists,

The musicianship highlighted on this
album is in the way Coleman and Metheny
work together. On almost every song,
Metheny and Coleman double each other’s

lines note for note, showing off their .

mastery over their respective instruments
and their ability to listen to each other
while playing, a talent that is at the very
core of all great jazz music.

The most interesting-sounding song on
the album is “Video Games." For this
song, Metheny uses a guitar synthesizer to
play a sound that resembles that of Coir

j eman's sax. The effect created is that of
dueling Saxophones instead of a conversa»
tion between sax and electric guitar.

The album is actually made up primarir
l of ”normal" songs, like “Mob Job" and

“Katheliri Grey.” For “Mob Job," Col
eman solos not only on sax but on the violin
as well. “Kathelin Grey” is a beautiful
slow ballad by Coleman and Metheny Th
combination of Coleman's sax and
Metheny's guitar give the song a sound
that can send Chills up the spine and a tear
to the eye.

Another fact that makes this album
great is the way it bridges the generation
gap between jazz musicians of different
eras. Ornette Coleman was one of the
pioneers of the free»jazz movement in the
60's and early 70's. Pat Metheny is one of
the most popular young jazz-rock musi-
clans of our time, working on diverse pro-
jecLs of his own with other artists and with
his own group,

The most wonderiul thing about free jazz
is the ieeling oi discovery that it can give
to the listener. Free jazz makes you listen
hard and actively seek out the greatness
mat each song contains, But once that
greatness has been round and heard, the
feeling that something totally new has
been uncovered is overwhelming.

Do yourself a favor and get hold of a
copy oi this album sit down in a dimly lit
and quet place with a glass oi wine and
discover the hidden magic this album has
to offer It's worth the time and effort.
Take it easy, but take it.

Japan irom page 5
Jostling and accidental collisions en
countered in Crowd situations are all th
same 7 nothing is acknowledged by
apologies

The contrast between the polite and th'
bestial is shocking. incomprehensible at
first, But upon reflection, the contradiction
is explainable, even if it isn't easy to
swallow.

One reason might lie in the group-
consciousnoss oi the Japanese. The groups
to which a Japanese belongs defines
his/her place in the world. Those who are
not a member of the group are literally
referred to as outsiders. When dealing
with outsiders. moreover, consideration
and politeness are not mandatory So
jostles are ignored 7 social niceties don’t
require one to tender apologies to a
stranger.

Another fact is that Crowds are a part of
life in Tokyo a it‘s impossible to get away
from them. The sheer enormity of
apologizing to everyone you bump into is
enough to resign anyone to just accepting
jostling as a way of lite, and get on with the
task at hand,

I suppose, from the cynic's viewpoint.
maybe the Japanese take pleasure in the
shoving and roughhousmg‘, being polite all
the time must build up plenty of frustra~
iion, I suppose this is one way to alleviate
it. though I don't believe that for a minute.
