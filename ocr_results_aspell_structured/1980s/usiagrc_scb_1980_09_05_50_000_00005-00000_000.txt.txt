Kenneth Browning, lormerly vice
Provost and Attirmative Action olflcer
oi Grinnell College, said he could not
recall that complaints had been lodged
by rejected women or minority can-
didates tor positions at Grinnell
College. Norma Gosselink, who

during Browning's tenure, reiterated
Brow ning's‘ remarks. She also said that
the reports and records or the program

The Report oi the Ailirmative Action

which contains iigures for most or the
period during which this institution has
had an Alfirmative Action Officer,
reveals that minority representation on

During the 197379 and 1979-80
academic years, the increase in men in

women in the prolesslonal stall during

over 44 percent to slid/3 percent}. The
modest increase in women in the
teaching taculty is attributed by the
report to the increasc in women‘s doc:

minority group, such as Hispanic
Americans, American lndians, and
Orientaermericans, The stated goals
oi the program, to attain 25 percent
women and 5 percent minority
representation in the teaching iaculty
by 1934, are based on the proJected
representation oi these groups in those

pos ssing PhD s at that time. The plan
also expresses a desire to have women
and minority groups represented at all
levels at the professional stall,

The Ailirmative Action Program
makes clear that the Administration is
committed to correcting the results of
past discrimination and-its realization
that the Situation will not be corrected

Mobe/IPIRG begin
another year of activism

by Mara Mann

MOBE/IPIRG, acronyms {or
Mobilization for Survival and Iowa
Public interest Research Group, are
two political activist groups which
merged last spring to increase their ei-
iectiveness on campus. similar goals
and a serious problem of “less than ac-
tive" members were major reasons for
the organizational change.

Both groups are affiliated With their
respective state and national organiza~
tions. MOEE's purpose is to protest
militarism, peacetime registration and
draft, nuclear power and the build-up of
nuclear arms. IPIRG, one of severall
chapters located in iowa. aims to pro
mote conservation, alternative energy
resources, the protection of wildlife,
and to educate the campus community
about various issues.

Although known as the most radical
organizations on campus, IPIRG
moderator Hugh Tozer said, “The
diversity or people among us keeps us
from being either too radical or too conr
servative." At an open house which at
tracted about 20 new students in-
terested in participating, Tozer and
MOBE moderator Dan Greenberg
stressed that both sides of all issues will
be closely examined. Major activities
oi last year included lobbying to pro-
hibit nuclear waste materials in Iowa.

conserve paper by reducing the amount

gressmen and the President about a

Truth in Testing: the investigation or
examinations such as LQ. tests and
s,A.T.'s, and letter writing to
legislators on various issues. in past
years, MOBE protested at lowa's only
nuclear power plant at Fall) and IPIRG

promoted a student relerendum on
campus which resulted in an FOG
boycott oi Nestle products tor the year.

This year, the groups’ moderators
look for a move to more educative ac-
tion on campus. Tozer cites recycling
as a probable major project this
semester. The groups would like to
have better cooperation between other
campus organizations, which could be
iacilitated by an organizational iorum
to discover common goals,

The moderators are confident of a
sucesslul year (or MOBE/IPIRG.
“Part or this year will be recuperating
irom last year and building up astrong
base," said Tozer. The merging oi the
groups and an increase in interested
people should solve past membership
diihculties, he noted. Meetings are held
weekly and participation in activities is
on a volunteer basis. As Greenberg
said, “The more members we have, the
more we can do."
