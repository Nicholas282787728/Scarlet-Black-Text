One part of my semester

of Gabriel Garcia Marquez. But to

work for the rehabilitation of

Crinservatively speaking.
Bogota is the homc of about 5.0m
“gaiiiincs” They are about so
pci-ccnt male. ranging between
the ages of 7 and 17 years. The
“gunlines” are about one segment
of a much larger group called
"fillies abandonados." or abane
doncd children The child
“gulnill” is considered abandoned
by both the liimily and the society.

The life of the ”gamin” is too
violent. too aberrant to be believ-
ed by the society around it.
Bogota's vast nliddle class has
diligently attempted not to
recognize the social piienomenon
of the "gamin." Thus. a Garcia
Marquez style mixture of myth
and reality has grown around this
subculture. further isolating it
from Columbian society.

The reality is that these
children are present in many
areas of the city. regardless oi the
relative wealth of the
neighborhood, Their presence is
directy dependent on lactors such

adequately facilitates their
“work” li.e.. robbing. pick-
pocketing. begging. singing.

food. movie theatres. park and

“alias". which are areas where
drugs are bought and sold; and an
area where they can bathe. for ex

These factors. along with the
variety or sexual “games” and
the level of violence with which
they come in contact all present
hazard to their health. including
different viruses such as venereal
disease. malnutrition and many
open wounds which run a high risk
of infection.

The C.T V.. currently In its se-
cond year. offers iii-st aid and
followup medical attention to ap-
proximately 500 children every
week. The C.’l‘ V. collaborates
with a number of other instituc
tinils iii Bogota to treat these
children This affords the CT V. a
more extenstve medical reach,

However. due to the lack of
funds and medical supplies the
work of the C.T.V is cu ently
under the threat or suspension.

Reminiscing and predicting:
a trustee’s view

by Scott Hildula

During Spring Break, 1 was for
tunate enough to spend the ﬁrst
week doing a Career Preview at
Time, inc, in New York. While at
Tin-lieI I had a chance to interview
Charley Bear, a trustee at Grin-
nell. Bear, who retired last month
from his position as group vice
president at Time. is a class of '39
graduate from Grinnell. While
Bear is now totally at home in the
Big Apple. he is originally irom
Washington. lowa. and was the
first three-year graduate from
Grinnell.

Following graduation from
Grinnell. Bear went on toa year of
diplomatic school; he entered the
armed services at the onset 0|
World War 11. While in uniform.
Bear discovered the charms of
The Big Apple. After his first
taste. he decided that he wanted to

live there and sought employment
with Time. Bear qualifed his first
position at Time by conducting
more International Business than
working for the magazine. When
he was 26. he was sent to Paris
and given a company car. He ad
mitted that he didn't have such a
bad time of it!

On the day that 1 spoke with
Bear. he was a week away from
retirement. His office was on the
34th floor of the TimeLife build-
ing overlooking the city. His sec-
retary, who took dictation irom
Winston Churchill when he wrote
his memoirs. escorted me into
Bear's plush but unpretentious ol-
lice. Charley Bear is much like
the Time~LIle Organization:
friendly. straight forward. and
knowledgeable,

in the course of our conversae
tinn. I asked Bear if he believes

that his liberal arts education ad»
equately prepared him for his
career. He told me that he didn't
appreciate his Grinnell education
until about ten years alter he had
finished. Now; when he looks back
at the good traits he has acquired.
he attrributes most of them to the
time that he spent as a Grine
llellian Bear doesn‘t think that
Grinnell is for everyone. but for
those without a definite career
choice. it is a fine place to go. He
doesn’t believe that most
freshmen are experienced enough
to make the best career choices
Decisions can be made that the in
dividual may end up regretting
later.

When I asked Bear how he felt
about possible changes in the
direction for the school he stated
that Grinnell is doing just tine, He
has no desire to see the student
body grow in size. Were it to
become as large as 2.000 students.
the whole character of the school
would change. “It may be slightly
elitist. but I don't want Grinnell to
relax admission standards and
allow more students in.”

Bear also thinks that the
prestige of Grinnell is definitely
increasing The people who really
know about colleges in the East
put Gl'lnnell very high on the list.

about large concerns. Matters
such as the environment and
South Africa will be of importance
through our lives. while concerns
of the college community won't
matter much to us a few years
after graduation.

Since 1 have always been
curious as to why we. as students
don't see the trustees. 1 question
ed Bear on this point, He replied
that since there are only three
meetings a year. the trustees are
only on campus twice while school
is in session. During this time the
trustees are tied up in endless
meetings. Bear stated that it is un-
fortunate that he. as a trustee.

Malice

toward
democracy

To the Editor'

We are sad. and saddened.
Events of the past Week have stun»
ned us , never had we thought that
Grinnell harbored Such malice
toward democracy We do not
speak of the student body but of a
select. elite group who have
brought themselves to light by
their actions against today's
referendum

Time and again. attempts to
work within the democratic pro
cess where mared by these peer
pie, SGA members spent four
hours making and putting up
posters displaying the resolution
and advertising today's r ferene
dum , they were immediately
criti zed as biased" and were
taken down in Main Clark. Smith
and the Post Office: Sombody
didn't want you to know about the
referendum.

More disheartening
knowledge that studcnt ome at
them involved with A. have
bccn circulating throughout the
campus urging students not to
vote Note to vote. mi d you. as
opposed to voting gainst".
Why? Because 40 percent of the
student body must vote today
beiore any decision on the resoiue
tioli can be reached If this doesn't
happen. the resolution fails on
viously some students don’t want
SGA'S power in this a curtail-
ed. and have decided that student
apathy is the best tool for aclilevV
ing the r ends

Sour grapes? No - the referen-
dums voters have not yet been
counted. Perhaps democracy won
and people voted. one way or the
other We \vrlte o y foul on the
seamy s' e of (a innell Vihich was
so visible during this beauhtul
spring week, Perhaps it's just as
well that next year's Ireshmen
will read ttlllt lll their tutorials.
They should arrive here with their
eyes open. 7 iii. Todd (.‘oulter. lan

Correction

in the letter printed last week
entitled “Politics referendum sup:
ported” by Russell Matteson and
Paul MacCready. the last
paragraph began. “The resolution
would not hypothetically increase
student political activity on cam-
pus. . . "

Unfortunately. the word “not"
was inserted in a typographical
mistake. The original letter did
not contain that particular word
and it changed the meaning of the
sentence. We regret the error.

Retraction

My page one article in last
week's 5&8 (27. April. 1984)
stated in the last paragraph that
David Mathias accepted the final
compromise on the resolution that
raced a referendum today. To set
the record straight. Mr. Mathias
voted against the resolution and
did not in fact accept the come
promise that was made at that
meeting

any confusion and/0r misinforma-
tion caused by t are dispelled by
