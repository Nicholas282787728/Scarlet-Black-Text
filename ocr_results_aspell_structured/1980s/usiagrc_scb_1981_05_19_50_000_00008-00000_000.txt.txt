i Grinnell really hasn’t changed

 

 

McConnell quite a headache when they were erected In 1978.

Somelhlng ts very drtterent about thrs class
0' 1981 i remember senior lrlerlds In classes
ol years gone by moaning about leaving
Crinrlell; alrard at the prospect of entering
that mythical ”real world,” But thrs class ts
ready to move on

Many equate themselves wtth those
graduates ol the past , they sard they too
could live lorever rn that Grtnnell, but not tn
this Crlnnell That dttterenee rs lmpollanl;
the Cnnne" ot yesteryear (well, maybe last
year or the year belore that) was so much
better, they say

And there rs no doubt about tt; thrngs have
changed very much. Cotng through old
photo lrles tt struck me that tour short years
ago the erection oi two ”towers” m the Crrll
could cause a mayor campus uproar, There
seemed to be at least one ”open lorum" per
week on some issue; dtvest lhls week,
boycott that week, protest atter that,

SH! news edttor Bob Mitchell never had a
dull moment; something was always happen

Dan. Flynn is art Amzncan-xmdles major
from Aurora, Illinore, He ran /armer 3&3
editor.

rng. Flrs! semester sophomore year was
rather tnterestlng too I held that news
editorship, and was usually busy, But then
somethtng happened; a Richard Turner kick-
ed 0" the semester wtth his resrgnation, and
evetyt g seemed to stop. Then news
edttor Andrew Schultz had plenty or tree
ttme and he started a tradrtron that goes on
to thrs day

Not that I blame Andrew lor the rampant
tnacttvtty on campus. It’s certainly not his
tault that lounyears ago an open torum on
the Grill renovation was packed while this
years torum on r ’nstatlng the r-grade drew
only a handtul. Nor s it hrs Iault that three
years ago students and laeulty members
vocally expressed concern about the rate ol
Meats, yet today all sit by as the bulldlng's
condition deteriorates lurttter

Nor, lot that matter, is it anyone's tault
Things just happened that way

in many ways, |he campus rs more relaxed
today than rt was then. Thts may seem
slrange' we are constantly told that today's
students are more tense, more warned
about linding labs, and so on. But at least
there ts more trust Four years ago it was
The Students, The Faculty and The Ad-
mrntstratron. each group had to keep a close
watch on the others,

And that went espectally lor the ads

mtntstratron, Tumer’s thenllamous, now-
Iorgotten whrte Paper on the luture ol Crln-
nell had been presented the year beiore we
atrived, and most everyone lelt threatened
by it what drd he mean: How could be
change ctrnnell tn that wayt Our collective
guard was up and we would light at
anythtng — even a renovation ol the Cull,

George Drake, ol course, helped change all
ol that Hts lnendly srnrle, open personality,
and stncerrty otten drsarmed would-be crtttts
(even sea editors seemed to ltke html). Alter
the years oi tensron, the campus wanted —
and needed — a break

So now we all trust a lrttle btt more The
chrade retnstatement ts not wttlely vrewed
as an attempt by the faculty and admlrilsuac
tron to assert control over students, but
rather as a sincere attempt to corlect
perceived problems. Many may drsagree
wtth that perception, but the stage mentality
ts gone: the classroom boycotts that two
years ago were promrsed to greet such a
move weven‘t even talked about.

oh yes, there has been autte a change 7
but has "Cllnnell" changed? For a long whtle
l thought so, but not any more

Htstory prolessor Al tones still smiles that
same grin, telltng us when thrngs are getting
too serious. And although loe Wall drd leave
tor a while he has come back. And onetrme
dean, then provost and dean, then rust pro-
vost, then executtve vice prestdent Waldo
Walker somehow managed through all those
trtle changes to keep the same otlrce on
Nollen second

The courses and the prolessors are basrcal-
ly the same, too. oh, a lew have lelt, and
maybe (I‘m told) a tenatn economtcs or
polttrcal scrence prolessor has ”mellowed,"
But thats rnore development than change.

No, crrnnell really hasn’t changed Bul the
world certatnly has lobs are much more
scarce, The "llberal" soctal programs of the
past are belng dtsmantled We may be
enterrng a nuclear arms race,

wtth all that going on towers tn the Crrll
seem trrvral

while the natron and the world were
more-than-less at ease-vdurlng our ltrst years
at Crinnell--students could attord to dream
ol being tn college lorever, But change rs tn
the atr, hidtng tn the lvory towers oi
academia just won't do We’ve had our lour
years ol rest and plepdvatlon: now its on to
the task at hand,

And lets not worry about Qrtnnell: the tn-
stttutron is much more than the students
present at any given ttme, The same forces
whrch created the noise durrng the Socral
Gospel movement and the nelse durrng the
slxKleS caused the calm we are tn now Soon,
they wtll once agarn make the campus
heard. it you en tarelully, you can hear rt
already
