Walker calls for
core curriculum

by Dave Joncs

During the iaculty meeting
last Monday, acting presidcnt
Waldo Walker delivered a speech
on the state oi Grinnell’s clu—
riculum. in the speech he sugs
gesled that the inriilty needed
to take a greatcr interest in the
basic education oi students, and
that general re uircments or a
core curriculum e installed.

Walker, who voted against
the llosrcquirenlents ouriculum
when it went into etrect said
in an interview with the scar.
let and Black that he is not
saying that the college should

um, lle ‘ust reels that Grins
nell shoul , as every other ma.
jor institution has, evaluate its
present state and look (or pos-
sible changes. “We’ve gone too
long without any serious consid
eratlon oi changing it," he said.

With the iaculty on its way

towards changing from a 3-3 to
a 3-2 teaching load, the admin-
istration seems to feel that the
time is right to make accompa—
ny—ing alterations in the curricu-
lum, Also, the college is ill the
midst of its self-examination in
pie aratioil for the North Cen-
lra Association review of Grills
nell, This self-study will until-
rally lead to ideas for change ill
many areas, including the cure
ricnlum.

“Any time you do an extensive
curriculum evaluation there's a
chance ior curriculum change,"
said Charles Duke, dean of the
faculty. He added that although
he does not know exactly what
Walker has in mind {or require
nients he feels, “We need a co-
herent general education curious
luni ofsonle sort."

Ali ElSatfar, SGA vice-prcsi -

dent, thinks that in general the
open curriculum oi Grlnllell is a
good idea, but he does not to-
tally disa ice with Walker’s o~
posal, “ll/e shouldn't be ali’aid
oi re-examining things and see-
ing ii we like a core curriculum,"
he said EISairar has his own

co ege is worried about students
being too departmentalized in
their courseloads,

As oi now, students are lini-

oi courses (humanities, science.
social science). The remaining
32 credits necessary tor gradua-

Gore reflects
on time In
Congress

by Dave Jones

From the time he entered Con-
gress as a Representative in 1938
until he leil as a Senator in ma,
Albert Gore, Sr. distinguished
himseli as a leader among his
peers, One or those peers, a young
man irom Massachusetts named
John F. Kennedy. relied upon Gore
to mastermind the domestic plat
form of his successful Presidential
campaign. On Tuesday. Gore was
in Grinnell to campaign [or
another Presidential candidate:
his son. Although the election
season is well upon us, the Scarlet
and Black took this opportunity to
talk to Gore not about his son’s
campaign, but about his own

l tenure in the political field.

Scarlet and Black
Did you ever have any aspires
tions towards the Presidency?

Albert Gore, Sr,

Yes, I looked in the mirror a few
times and thought I might be see-
ing a President looking back at me.

Scarlet and Black

Some people describe you as a
groundbreaker in southern liberal
politics. How would you describe
yourself?

Gore
Well. i was a progressive or a
liberal, or perhaps a political
adventurer. Terrible things,

Gore

There have been vast changes.
When I iirst entered the Senate in
1952, television was in its iniancy.
By the end oi my in years oi ser
vice it had become the dominant
media oi communication oi
political iniluence and the source
oi a signiilcant portion oi our
cultural unity.

Scarlet and Black

is the ielevising oi the houses oi
Congress a plus ior politics or a
drawback?

Gore

It is a great contribution to the
periormance oi the members, to
the education oi the American peo-
ple and to the elevation oi the
status and iniluence oi the
legislative branch oi the govern»
ment. It's a great contribution to
democracy. incidentally, my son
led in that iield, iirst in the House
and then in the Senate.

Scarlet and Black
In what ways has political cam-
paigning changed over the years?

Gore

There are numerous ways. For
instance, in my tirst campaign lor
Congress in 1938, my campaign ex-
penses totaled approximately

Senate in l952 cost approximately

labels, they mean one thing to one
man, something else to another, I
think those terms would
reasonably describe my
philosophy and record

Scarlet and Black

How much progress has been
made in the civil rights movement
since you first came into ollice?

core

Socially, it's a diiierent world.
The chiei beneiiciaries have been
the racial minorities, women, and
what I‘d class as a vocational
group, the men and women in the
service and oi our society, But
many people are new to that seg
ment oi our society (service
markets). They have not yet
achieved equality oi income, and
yet they periorm a very acute seg
ment at our way oi lire. More pro-
gress will be coming their way. i

Scarlet and Black
What major changes have you

; seen in the goingson of Congress

since you first entered office?

$50,000, One could easily budget
now. tor a state-wide campaign in
Tennessee, $5,000,000. I do not
regard this as political progress. I
think it’s political degradation.

Scarlet mid Black

who was the President with
whom you most saw eye»to-eye
during your time?

Gore

1 would Say that would be Fresh
dent Kennedy. I think it was partly
generational, He and I were
elected to the House oi Represen-
tatives at the Same time, sat Side
by side at committees, and we had
social contact. Mrs, Gore and l
were two at 10 people at a small
party in a private home when Con-
gressman Jack Kennedy,
bachelor, met a young lady named
Jaqueline Bouvier, As one who had
some antennae ior such things, 1
observed some sparks ilying bet
ween those two young people
heiore the night was over, beiore
the evening was over, night doesn't
sound good.
