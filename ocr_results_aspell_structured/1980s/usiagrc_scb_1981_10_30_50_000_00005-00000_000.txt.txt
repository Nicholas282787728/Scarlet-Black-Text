The same ls true with South Africa. I
hear bickering about the worthlessness of
divestiture, Yet the only group actually
taking decisive action is the South Airican
Support Group. Personally, I‘m glad to see
at least one group on campus. the Support
Group. perceiving the most basic ilaw in

the South African Support Group is asking
the most important question; will Grinnell

rowdies who presumably knew how to
have a good time." He claims that the
"bang" part was added simply to rhyme,
and to mean "a sense oi thrill or excite-
merit," I have seen the words "gang" and
“bang" used in sequence in many cone
texts, but i have never seen it used to con
note anything other than a group rape
Even if the persons who named this event
did not intend tor the title to have such cone
notations, many people interpret it as such
7 not only those who are oiiended by it,
but also those who like the title and wish to
, continue using it.
Mr. Archambault's second argument
likewise is quite weak. He states that

“when the name “gang bang‘ is replaced ,

with anything, it Just does not. sound like
much iun anymore." Considering that he
is accusing those who oppose the title oi

u reading too much into the name, this is a
rather pathetic deiense of his position Tell
me, Mr. Archambault, what is it about the

.name "gang bang" that sounds like so
much fun? Didn't parties such as the
HaightrAshbury party or Younker Tie par~
ty sound like iun to you? Can't you possibly
think oi something that sounds like iiin
that doesn't also sound like an assault
against women?

Then Mr Archambault assures us that
there is no connection between this title
and any attacks on campus 7 past or pre»
sent, 1 had never heard any such accusa-
tions, but there is a connection. There is,a
delinite connection between the attitudes
toward the title oi the “gang bang" and the
attitudes toward the recent rape oi astu-
dent. it is no coincidence that an alarming
number of male students iound the 00
curence oi a rape quite amusing and that
the same students that think “Gang Bang
is a good name, sounds like a real good
time, heheh heh." By retaining a part title
which treats the subject of rape as a joke,
we foster such insensitive attitudes, we at-
iirm them, and we make no progress at all
towards their erradi cation.

who are attended by the title of his hall's
party as ”the lew who have nothing better
to worry and/or complain about " What
would you consider as something better ior
us to worry about. Mr Archambault" Why
is worrying about the perpetuation ot
womanrhating attitudes not important?
Why is your total lack ni respect tor the
women oi this campus not important"

Let's look at this issue ltunt another
perspective. Say that the title was
something that was extremely otiensive to
black students. or Jewish students 7 any
religion. race. creed or national origin
Most oi those groups are oi a minority on,
campus 7 would this be grounds for conti
nuing use or a title which oilended them"
In fact, would the SGA so blithely let the
subject pass through their hands? Would
the college allow it to continue?

I think not, They would not dare The ens
tire campus would be mobilized, and a
change would be last in coming But
because this issue deals with women. it is
deemed unimportant, This is because we
live in a womanrhating society. and Grins
nell, ior all its progressive trappings, is a
part of that society.

This is a serious issue Theallitudes that
exist at Grinnell will travel out into the
world with Grinnell students when they
leave, If we allow womanrhatlng attitudes
to continue here, tlten now can we expect
to rid the world of them?

There are people on this campus who ob
yect ot the title Gang Bang. We must make
a stand, we cannot simply sit back and bc
silent. We can make a change, we can
make a dent in the erroneous ways of
thinking that surround us, It the name Is
not changed, we can boycott, People like
Mr. Archambault will tell you that you will
be missing a great party, but surely we
could get together and make our own great
party, one without a hostile title,

Divestment is the
proper way to go

Today, the college's Board of Trustees is
being confronted with the decision ol
whether Grinnell should divest itself of
stock held in corporations which operate in
South Africa. This decision carries
momentous implications ior the ethical
character of Grinnell‘s financial endows
ment iand thus oi the college itselii and,
more importantly, articulates Grinnell's
explicit stance in relation to black South
Airica's struggle ior liberation.

Opponents oi divestment argue that to
day's decision represents no such stance,
They maintain instead that continued in-
volvement in the American corporate
structure 7 either through reiorm
measures such as proxy resolutions or
simply by supporting present corporate
operations 7 is the best way in which Grin
hell can contribute to the advancement of
yustice and equality in South Africa The
assumption that Grinnell can eiiectively
iniluence corporate policy through proxy
statements clearly provides an unsatisfacr
tory iustifcation lor the corporate involve
ment option in 1979, at the peak of nation»
wide concern ior corporate responsibil’ y
in South Alrlca, proxy statements address-
ing this Concern met with overwhelming
opposition of 98 2 percent, 96 percent and
947 percent, respectively, in the boar
drooms of General Motors, LB M. andU .
Steel Given Grinnell‘s already small voice
as a shareholder, proxy action constitutes
little more than an empty gesture, holding
iorth no realistic prospect ior change.
The corporate relationship to the racist
status quo is further illuminated by the
South Airican government's request in
time that all ioreign investors lorm coin
porate militias among white employees
and pay ior the installation oi arms and
communications gear on company
premises, U S corporations have yet to
comply with the request 7 primarily
because its terms require that record oi
the proposed expenditures be withheld
lrom Corporate home offices 7 but the Iact
that they can be approached in such a
manner, alongside the precedent oi tiie
G.M plan, clearly indicates that
American corporations are a dependable

corne -tone oi the apartheid system

similar examples can be drawn irom
other domains of the South African
economy and a consideration or the met-
[ectual nature and enforcement of the core
porate guidelines embodied in the Sullivan
Principles would iurther ampliiy the pre-
sent general sketch but the above informa
tion should demonstrate that the U.S. core
porate presence is a collusive and not a
moderating iorce in thc structure oi the
apartheid government It is iitting.
however, that ihe linal word in this por-
trayal oi corporate interests should come
from black South Africa itself In a recent
article iii the 58th, David Molho quoted
with approval the black trade union leader
Freddy Sauls — a coniirmed supporter oi
the continuation of apartheid who thus res
tains the right to speak inpublic — on the
beneficial economic effects of U.S. corn
porate involvement in South Airica A iar
more representative statement oi black
South Africa‘s position is voiced by the
banned South African Congress of Trade
Unions which has declared tliai’

The ending of foreign investment
in South Africa is a means of
undermining the power oi the apar-
theid regime. But it is oi such imporr
lance that there can be no com-
promise whatever about it ironi our
point oi view. Foreign investment is
a pillar oi the whole system which
maintains the virtual slavery- oi the
black workers in South Africa,

As long as Grinnell continues to hold
stock in corporations which do business in
South Airica, the College comes down
iirmly iii support oi a morally indeiensible
system oi racial oppression Given the In'
adequacy or conventional approaches to
corporate reiorm, Grinnell has no other
means or retraining irom active support or
apartheid and of expressing solidarity
with black South Airica‘s struggle ior
freedom, than to divest. It is hoped that the
trustees aét today in accordance with this
simple ethical imperative 7 but iftney tail
to do so, it is the responsibility oi the stu
dent body to remind them oi their moral
obligation in the future 7 Chris Lehmann

Publisher makes correction

To the Editor:

\ in your tict 2 edition, an article by
Marilyn i Clark indirectly quotes column
nist Gary Giddins as saying that ”the
publishing company tin Grinnellt" engagr
ed in “‘Censorshiprlike tactics" against
both the 5&3 and the nowrdel’unct
Pterodactyl

Assuming the accuracy oi the quote, Mr,
Giddins' memory or the period is perhaps
iading a bit.

SKIP

The ilcrald-iicgistci- Publishing Co
clearly is the firm to which he was referrs
ing. But a check oi our records veriiies
that this company never published the
Ptcrodactyl, nor did it have the contract
ior printing the 5&8 at that time, The two
publications were typeset and printed in
other communities

Thanks for allowing me to set. the record
straight. 7 John Breemer. |lrrzi|il~
