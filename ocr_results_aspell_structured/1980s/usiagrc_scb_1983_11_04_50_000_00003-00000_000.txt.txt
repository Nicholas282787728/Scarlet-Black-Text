Black Cultural

Scarlet & Black

Why a Black Cultural Weekend?

Why does Black Cultural Weekend at
Grinnell College exist? A relatively simple
question for a black person to answer,
right? Not exactly! The reason why black
students at Grinnell attempt to share part
of their culture with the white majority is
as complex as each student,

Black students at Grinnell come from a
wide variety of backgrounds. There are al-
ty, suburban, rural and toreign blacks.
Some live in upper class communities.
some live i" lower class communities
students ct-i: - from a wide variety or
educational Lia. kgrounds as well. Many
went to integrated schools. Some went to
all black schools and still there are those
who went to schools much like Grinnell
where they were the minority.

It is not hard to understand why blacks
relate to the white community at Grinnell
in different ways. Some find it easier to
assimilate than others, Some are content
to remain separated. So it is the obvious

differences as well as the more subﬂe dlfr
ferences that Black Cultural Weekend
strives to show the white community.

For some black students it presents the
opportunity to show their white peers that
most of the stereotypes regarding the blr
ack race are false and that we exist merely
as people of a different culture, much the
same as foreign students, Yet for Others
Black Cultural Weekend has an entirely
dilterent purpose: to show the campus
community that blacks only diner from
whites in skin color, Then there are those
who only want to offer the white students
the chance to sample cuisine that is
typically black. Etc, etc. , . . ,

Any white person that does not come to
events sponsored by the black students or
Grinnell is missing out on the opportunity
to better acquaint himself with the world
in which he lives. We hope that through our
efforts Grinnell can become a more unified
campus and a truly liberal environment,

 

Black Images
in the Media

by Rory Slater

For those new on the set, and/or
oblivious to the happenings in the stage
wings, Grinnell College will again be the
setting of a commemoration of black
culture. In an effort to dispell the effects of
past rumors, let it be said that Black
cultural Weekend is not conducted to the
exclusion of nonrblacks. Rather, one of the
primary intentions is to expose the Grin-
nell community to various aspects of black
culture. All are welcome to attend events -
iilms, food bazaar, variety show, dnace
and worship service.

This year's theme, “Black Images in ﬁle
Media". has been selected for several
reasons. One reason is that aside from con»
temporary iilms in which blacks are cast,
there are classic black films which provide
immense entertainment but are unknown
to the general public. perhaps more imv
portant is the presence in such films of
social, economic and political comments
on blacks in American society, One might
be challenged to contemplate the changing
image of blacks as depicted by the great
media magnates through the years.

All too trequently, it happens that one‘s
concept of a certain subject or entity is ins
completely and/or erroneously formed.
The concept is confined to what is gathered
from the “all~powerlul” media. Unfore
tunately, the media ~ effective as it is in
conveying attitudes and images — is

deceptive and misleading Many groups of
people have been victimized by the media
— women, southerners, Hispanics, and
athletes, to name a few.

The role of media as social commentary,
through its tendency to project images,
can become anachronistic. A substantial
percentage of American women have
become financially and psychologically in
dependent or the male sex, many
southerners are quite progressive and
culturally aware, and one only has to pick
up a copy oi “Sports Illustrated" to note
the impressive academic and career
credentials of many of America‘s most
oulsuinding athletes, Yet the media per-
sists in adhering to and presenting images
at the past, even in light oi increasing
evidence to assert the contrary. Capable of
greater sophistication and subtlety or
presentation, the media occasionally ap-
pears iastened to the past. Blacks have not
been spared.

,Both films selected for this weekend,
“Carmen Jones” and ”Stormy Weather,"
are landmark films in terms of the casting
and use of blacks. The films are both very
entertaining - drama, music, and dancer
Lena Horne. one of the stars of “Stormy
Weather." stands today as a marvelous
legend for her theatrical talenB and beau—
ty. The late Dorothy Dandridge, more
obscure perhaps because of her early
death, was considered a promising black
actress, when she appeared in “Carmen

 

 

last year’s Bcw soul tood bazaar.

Jones." If you are so inclined, transcend
the element of entertainment upon seeing
these films and reflect on the images of
blacks and other groups in the media to—
day. '

There are a few black actors, such as
Cicely Tyson and Sidney Poitier, who have
managed to deny the roles ususally dic-
rated to blacks and other groups by pro
ducers and directors, One may ask why
others have not followed such isolated. difv
ficult paths in the media industry. When it
comes to a profession such as acting. con
sider that those who have entered such a
profession do so out of love and commit-
ment other field, Upon arduously devoting
one's life to pursuit of this career,
however, the issue usually becomes mak

ing a living. Thus, you take what you can'

get, Hats off to those who have defied such
limitations. But consider the vast majority
or actors who could not, and ponder over
the historical context and the dominating
presence of increasingly unrealistic im—
ages present by the media. Jennifer Beale
or “Flashdance” could very easily have
been Lena Home in “Stormy Weather".
Debra All or “Fame,” similarly, could
have replaced Dorothy Dandridge in
“Carmen Jones.” The same images are
present, perhaps more refined, A con-
scious, knowledgeable and discerning in-
dividual can be put to the test.

Aside from the thematic issues or Black
Cultural Weekend. several events are
planned. The tood bazaar will besatisfying
for those who like the savory and spicy. A
variety or ioods will be available, ranging
from stew and chicken to peach cobbler.
The variety show will feature dramatic,
musical and dance performances by black
students, ﬂavored by black American
culture. There will also be a dance with
plenty of music to make your feet move
and your hips roll. Finally, a religious ser-

vice will be held in Herrick Chapel, coor-
dinated and conducted by some of Grin-
nell's black students. There will be
ieatured readings of biblical term and per
formances of spirituals by soloists and the
Young, Gifted and Black gospel chuir.

Enlighten yourself this weekend. Enter»
tainment is available for all; the deeper
sense at education to be drawn may take a
little more effort.
