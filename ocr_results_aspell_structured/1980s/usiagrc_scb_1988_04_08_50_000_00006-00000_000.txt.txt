On Second Thought

Burling graffiti is on the down
slide in the men's room: Hector is
portrayed as a pig. and women are
portrayed as sea objects. But their
are a few hopeful signs, including
concern about the direction Grin-
nell is headed, often manifested in
jokes about freshmen with high
SAT scores. There is a real con~
Cern about the character of the stu-
dent body. and how it is noticeably
changing

One thing often cited by people
We spoken with is that students
tend to be more conservative and
inhibited today than they were five
years ago. Mr. Smith thinks
students tend to be more
“mainstream" than they used to
be. A senior on my floor last year
was particularly concerned about
the apparent increase in concern
over appearances; she cited the
dwindling number of “Jesi” and
“Mosi” tpronounced jeezeye and
mozeye: longhaired bearded men,
dark and blondrhaired. respec-
tivelyl on campus,

Last night I was talking to my
buddy Paul about the vice-
presidentlal candidates and the
proposal of one of them to allow the
equivalent of athletic scholarships
in order to revamp the football pro-
gram, and came to the conclusion
that this was a bad idea, His cone
cern was that the same standards
be maintained for the acceptance
of all students, with the exception
of affirmative action candidates, a
condition he believes exists now.
What we had trouble explaining
was the apparent shift in the
character of the student body; why

are we more complacent and,

disinterested than We were five
years ago? Why is student concern
over issues affecting us so weak?

Chris Gunst cites a lack of com-
munication between SGA and the
students. and a general ignorance
of the issues affecting student life.
and he's probably right. But isn‘t
this change in attitude also a fund
tion of the shift in demographics of
Grinnell's student body over the
past few years?

As Grinnell becomes more
"competitive", how does the focus
on applicants' characteristics
Shift? 15 there an increased em'
phasis on SAT scores paired with a
decreased focus upon individuals'
personal characteristics which
might enrich the student body as a
whole? Are we sacrificing divcrsi-
ty for competitiveness? .lohn
Hopkins thinks not.

Mr. Hopkins enplaincd to me
that though we did shift our focus
within individual applications last
year, the shift will lead to greater
diversity, Our previous methods,
in which academic periormancc
was the first consideralion, stanr
dardized test scores were second.
and the least important factor was
promise of contribution: has becn
changed so that promise of con
tribution is now equal to scores in
weight (25% eachl Academic per
formance includes class standing.
faculty and counselor recommen-
dations, and the amount of
academic challenge an applicant
endeavored in proportion to the
amount of opportunity presented
at her/his high school. The appli-
cant pool is divided into ninths on
this basis. Standardized test scores
include SAT: and ACTS; the
highest of the two is used if both
are taken “Promise of contribu
tion' includes ineschool activities.
interests, work, community and
life experience; it is an attempt at
measuring the potential of the stu
(lent to contribute to the Grinnell
community. and to what degree

Grinnell will be able to serve the
student,

The applicant pool has grown to
about 2.000 per year, for 350 spaces,
loan will be accepted this year,
thirty to fifty will be taken from the
waiting list of too. According to
Mr. Hopkins, so percent of the ap-
plicants could survive here and do
well academically; cutting down
from so to around 55 percent brings
the promise oi contribution factor
into play; Mr. Hopkins cites the in-
crease in the number of Students
who are musically inclined as a
result of this increased look at in-
dividual talents and interests. He
did not mention to me any plans for
a conservatory. The decrease in
percentage of students accepted
compared to past years is the pro-
duct of increased competitiveness
within the applicant pool; there
are more applicants, who on the
whole are more competent and
have greater promise of contribu-
tion. Thus, because we have a bet-
ter pool and more applicants, ape
plicants must compete harder with
one another to get in. Those who do
not have strong records of
academic performance have very
little chance of getting in las this is
fifty percent of their application).
Mr. Hopkins points out that the
really tricky part of admissions is
that one cannot accurately predict
the motivation of students: The
student whose Dad pestered him
throughout high school about his
chemistry grades is laced here
with countless diversions and
alternatives to study Thus the ac-

ceptance of any candidate is really .

a gamble, The proportion of
students who enter Gr'ih ell as
freshmen and graduate within five
years is around 75 percent

Furthermore. Mr. Hopkins
describcd to me the process of
blind second readings and faculty
review of all applicants. Even if
one of the admissions officers were
prone to favor a certain
demographic group. he or she
would be counterbalanced by
others in the admissions process.
Mr. liopkins says that the occur
rence of conflict between adr
mlnistrators' evaluations (in
dicated by a difference of more
than four points on a 36 point
scalel is very rare, indicating
similar standards among ads
ministrators. But if there is a slant
toward any demographic group
within the admissions staff it is
unlikely that this would be noticed.
except, perhaps, by the iacully
members of the Admissions and
Financial Aid Committee Thus the
belief that the admissions staff
favors any one group could not be
explained away on this basis. In-
cidcntally, the students on this
committee do not see the applica-
tions, though they do vote on
changes in admissions procedures.
such as last year's shifts to a
50/25/25 system.

in light of this information. Paul
and I would be baseless in asserr
ting that the increase in apathy oi
the student body is a result oi a
deliberatc shift in the type of Stu»
dent sought out by Admissions,
Likcwise we would be on shaky
ground if we were to try to link
what we perceive to be the rise in
conservatism and apathy on cam-
pus to a set oi policies acted upon
by Admissions. But in reality. as
we attract more conservative
students. and they come to see
more people like themselves
alrcady here, they will be more
likely to come here.

How do i dare link conservatism
with apathy? If one perceives cone

Scarlet and Black

scrvatism as maintenance of the
status quo, and action leads to
changes in the status quo, then
lack of action can be linked to con»
servatism. This is not to belittle
conservatives as apathetic. far
from it, if there are no threats to
the status quo, there is no reason
for conservatives to act. Conser-
vatives act to beat back change
fostered by other groups; it odier
groups are inactive (as is become
ing the case here) conservatives
need not act, Thus the necessity
arises for conservatives to act only
when radicals are acting; a dearth
oi action indicates that tewer peo-
ple feel compelled to change the
status quo, and thus that more pear
ple are becoming conservative,

Paul and l are both here largely
because of the freedom we saw of-
fered here: freedom to choose our
own courses of study. freedom to
be ourselves. As Paul puts it,
“We're all strange here, but it's a
good kind of strange. We’re all
ourselves." Our fear is that if a
contingent oi conservatives mare
ches onto campus that individualb
ty will be trampled beneath the
boots of clubishness and cli~
queisnness. These are rampant at
other institutions. including many
of those we now compare ourselves
with; but if we had wanted to live
with them we would not have come
to Grinnell,

But just who is accepted to Grin»
nell College? What determines who
will apply here and who will come?
In large part we depend on word of
mouth. upon reputation to attract
new students. We also send a lot of
mailings. as you may remember.

"out outside the process oi admis-

sion. a student's visit to campus
plays a large role in whether or not
she/he decides to come here, thus
the students who have a great ima
pact on prospectives are the tour
guides. i have often heard
disparaging remarks about how
the tour guides do not represent an
accurate cross Section of Grinnell
students, not uncommonly by tour
guides who are discontented with
their peers. Are they a represonr
tative sample of the student body‘7
or do they tend to be the more con
servative dressers who will give a
facade of social respectability to
Grinnell? 1 have great respect for
the college as an institution, but
see the guides as a group inten-
tionally selectcd to mislead proe
spectives. These are not the most
devious pcoplc, merely a
misrepresentation of our diversity.
Was Dave Kopelman a tour guide?
I think not. Just what are the
criteria used in selecting tour
guides7

John Hopkins says that the Ads
missions staii attempts to repre-
sent the divcrsity of the student
body in the ranks of the guides; he
cites the prcscnce of international
students. blacks. and students
from the coasts in the ranks as an
indication of this diversity. He does
acknowledge that there are no
science majors on the staff, and
that humanities/social science ma

5 and student advisors are the
rule. But this is to be expected:
they are the people people, the
natural Communicators. But if
thcrc are over eighty applications
for 20 to 25 vacant spots each year.
it seems we could have a bit more
diversity The degree to which a
prospective can empathize with a
tour guide docs influence his or her
decision to come here. If you like
your guide you will be more likely
to come here, and if you dislike

Former Democratic

Candidates Victims
of Misunderstanding

John Newmark

On the last Saturday of spring
break, a lot of relatives were over
at our house for a family dinner, in-
cluding two cousins of mine, 2 and
4 years old. After dinner, I
overhead their tather reading
them a story from a Sesame street
book, Once upon a time, there were
nine people who enyoycd playing
baseball very much, but every
time they went to the sandlot to
play, nine large dragons came out
of the sky and said, “Horkle-
Snorkle Higgledy shoot" Natural-
ly, the nine people were scared and
ran away. This happened every
time they went to the sandlot, so
they never got to play baseball.
They tried many things to scare
the dragons away, but nothing
seemed to work They were
dragons after all, and dragons are
hard to scare. After many failures,
one person said that he had a book
about dragons at home which
might be of some help. “Perhaps
we can figure out what Horkle»
Snorkle Higgledy Snoo means."
They looked up the words. and
what they found out. surprised
them all. The next day they went to
the sandlot with nine extra bats
and gloves: When the dragons
came, saying. ”Horkle Snurkle
Higgledy shoo,” this time the nine
people offered the equipment to the
dragons, and the two groups
played baseball. it seems Horkler
Snorkle Higgledy Snoo. in dragon
talk, meant, “We want to play
baseball. too."

committed an unforgivable sin.
His charismatic voice, which could
easily have defeated Bush, was no
longer heard. nor were the many
good ideas that he had for the m,
tion. Representative Gephardt. the
second victim, was wrongly accus-
ed of iavoring high tariffs, trade
walls, and many other bad things.
all wrapped up in one word, “pro-
tectonism “ People reminded us
that tariffs, trade walls, and pro-
tectionism caused the Great
Depression Unfortunately, few
people realized that Gephardt
desired to make trade more free,
while the Smootal’lawley Act that
led to the Great Depression made
it [as free. Gephardt was forced
out of the race because of lack of
support. His popular message that
would probably have worked
against Bush was silenced.

No other victims were Governor
Babbitt and Senator Simon. Bab-
bitt admitted that taxes would
have to be raised. He knew what
had to be done to solve America's
problems, and he had the courage
to tell people: butnobody listened.

He was forced-to drop out of the

race also. Simon is still in the race,
but he lacks enough support to be a
contender. He has many good
ideas and also could defeat Bush
fairly easily, but nobody listens to
him, either, Everyone assumes so
meone as clean-cut and

be hiding something,

Senator Biden, the first victim, was

people said he committed plagiarism.

plagiarism.

As with many cluldren’s stories.
there are lessons to be learned
from this. The people in the story
didn't listen to what the dragons
had to say. They jumped to the con
clusion that the dragons were evil
because of what they had heard of
dragons. if they had only stopped
to figure out what the dragons
were actually saying earlier, they
could have played baseball sooner.
The present situation the
Democratic party is in is a result of
many people not learning this im-
portant lesson early in life.

The situation, in brief. is that
George Bush, who has all but ob-
tamed the Republican nomination,
is considered by many people to be
easy to defeat. However, all but
one of the candidates who could
have defeated him easily have
been forced to drop out of the race,
because people assumed that what
they were hearing about these can
didates was bad They had been
told by others it was bad. Only
those who listened carefully to
what they heard understood it for
what it really was and supported
the candidates. However, unfor-
tunately, these people were too
few.

Senator Biden, the first victim,
was forced out of the race early
because people said he committed
plagiarism The incidents were un-
fortunate errors of omission, not
intentional acts of plagiarism.
However, to the people, Biden had

three other Democratic ca
didates, all of whom, I am afraid,
cannot defeat Bush. The best hope
might be Senator Gore. His posi-
tions are probably conservative
enough to attract a sufficient
number of Republicans away from

Bush. However, the
Republicans could easily defeat
him by emphasizing his former
liberal positions. Gore also ap-
pears to be most popular only in
the South, which is not enough for a
victory, Governor Dukakis at one
time seemed a good possibility, but
support for him seems to be
weakening. People are worrying
about his ioreignpolicy ex-
perience, and they also feel that he
lacks charisma. While charisma
might not be necessary in order to
be a good president, it is unfor-
tunately a prerequisite for a suc~
cessful election.

The final candidate is Jackson
He is the first serious black con-
tender for the office of president.
His supporters think that his great
recent successes mean that he can
just as easily win in November if
he is nominated. A careful look at
the results of the primaries show
why this is not the case. While he
has won many of the primaries, on-
ly in percent of the white voters
vote for him. in the general elec-
tion this to percent will not be
enough to win. Then how is he win-
