Disrupting Chile: human rights

You don’t read much about the
political situation in Chile these days.
In fact, you don‘t read much about
Chile at all. That’s interesting, con»
siderlng the past deep involvement of
the United States in the policies and
economy of that country—and the un-
precedented persecution of and
violence toward Chile’s eltizenry
which characterized that involvement.

Salvador Allende, the Marxist-
Leninist candidate tor the presidency
of Chile, was elected to that office ten
years ago by a plurality oi the voters,
aiter two previous attempts tailed. His
socialist platform was based around
the nationalization of the largely
U,S,rowned Chilean copper industry,
stepped-up land reform,’wage hikes,
housing improvements, and autonomy
in toreign policy. He was adamant
that these changes take place
peacefully and gradually, rather than
in an atmosphere of violent revolution.
Isabel Letelier, Who spoke at Grinnell
two years ago, recalled the overjoyed
reaction of the middle class to
Allende’s victory, and the dancing in
the streets which took place. The
Chilean people sensed that the strugr
gle for independence and identity had
finally swung in their favor.

The U.S. government was not pleas-
ed. The CIA had successfully kept
Allende from Winning the 1961 election
by tunnelling 3 million American tax
dollars to the opposition party through
a private businessman, who passed
them off as personal donations. Durr
mg the 1970 campaign, the Nixon ad
ministration authorized the CIA to
Spend $435,000 for Covert anti~Allende
“spoiling" operations: extensive use
of scare tactics, propaganda, and son
sationalism, all designed to discredit
and defeat Allende American
businesses with vested interest in
Allende's defeat, including the huge
Anaconda Company, chipped in about
$850,000 toward the anti-Allende activi-
ty

The reasoning behind this Inex-
cusable undeitaklng was totally
misguided. Allende, the U S. feared,

trol 80 percent of all productive assets
of the so-called non~communist world
and the U S Chamber of Commerce
adds that by 2000, the assets oi these
few hundred companies will be over $4
trillion or about 50 percent of
“everything worth owning tor the
creation of wealth.”

A bill has already been introduced
in Congress calling for business
managers to be held Criminally liable
for decisions which endanger human
life, The rest of the Democracy Act
will be introduced soon by Cons
gressmen and Senators who strongly
support corporate reform. Such provr
sions have been accepted wholly or in
part by every Western European nar
tion with successful results, but here

would quickly become a Soviet pup-
pet; Henry Kissinger couldn‘t under-
stand “why we need to stand by and
watch a country go communist due to
the irresponsibility of its own people.”
In iact, Allende dld not preach comr
munist ideology, and was committed
to a policy of independence and nuns
alignment. Unfortunately, leftover
cold war neuroses dictated American
actions, and the nbsessmn with con»
taining Soviet expansionism whercvcr
the u.s, (correctly or incorrectly)
perceived that it might encroach led
to the rabid and illogical desire for the
defeat of the Marxist candidate

Despltc the best efforts of the CIA,
and to its regret, Allende was elected
in September 1970. But that didn’t stop
the Nixon White House: once Allende
took office, the US, began to out off
all economic and trade activity with
the tiny nation. Allende, who was ex»
tremely eager to have a fricndly rela-
tionship with the U.S., called the move
a “stunning blow (made) Without the
slightest provocation.” Washington
blocked loans by international institus
tions and denied all credit to Chile: all
credit, that is, except the sale of
military hardware, including jet
fighter planes, to the Chilean armed
forces, Ill the end, it was this
economic blockade which paved the
way for the military coup dew. and
Allende’s assassination. The Chilean
middle class, used to its creatule com-
forts, rose in protest against its

Here at Grinnell, there will be an
extensive program of educational and
discussion events on various aspects
of the Corporate world: global and
domestic food production, energy
systems, unions, corporate orlmes,
plant shutdowns, and the causes of
some inflation. There will be articles
appearing on these pages, films to
spur the imagination, panel discus-
sions, lectures, and more informal
talks, There is no single answer or
