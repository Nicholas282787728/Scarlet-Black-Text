Here's the lineup of films for the next
couple of weeks:
The Stuntman (1980, 129 min.) — A
fascinating movie within a movie that
weaves impressive stunts and impressive
performances between a suspenseful
mystery and an offbeat romance, Peter
O‘Toole stars as a brilliant, satanic direc~
tor who adopts Lucky Cameron (Steve
Railsback), a fugitive from the law, to
Stand in for a Stuntman killed on the set ot'
his WW1 epic. Once caught in this situa-
tion, the cynical Cameron throws himself
into the role and several dangerous rela-
tionships. E‘reneticslly paced and wonder-
iully edited, the lilm moves quickly and
takes the audience right a‘ ing Wl'h it. An
interesting look through a complex story
at reality and illusion. An impressive film.

Alice‘s Restaurant (1969, 111 min) —- This
Arlo Guthrie song made an original film
surprisingly full of substance and charm.
This film recounts the adventures of
Guthrie leading up to his subsequent ar-
rest {or littering. The scenes, which sus—
tain their striking tone, capture the spirit
of the time. This is a unique commentary
on how American youths felt about society
in the late sixities.

Romeo and Juliet (1968, 152 min.) A This
thirteenth version of Shakespeare’s tragic
romance is probably the finest, visually.
Franco Zeftirelli recreates the essence of
15th century Verona, and both the
cinematography and costumes won the
film Academy Awards. The Mercutio»
Tybalt duel is sensational and Michael
York is quite tine. Unfortunately, Oliva
Hussey (15) and Milo O’Shea (17), though
physically ideal, 'are not always convinc»
ing as the doomed lovers, and sometimes
seem too immature for their roles. But
still, a.very beautiful, if slightly long Vera
siun of this classic.

How Green Was My Valley (1941, 118 min.)
— This John Ford film, which _won iour
Academy Awards, is a stagey, but poigr

‘,nant story. The film deals' with a boy in a
Welsh mining town, as he experiences the
disintegration of his iamily and the
destruction of the’town in which he lives.
Though slightly dated, this film is definite
ly a heart tugger and a must [or all film
butls.

You Can’t Take It With You (1938, 127
min.) 7 With a ianiastic script adapted
from the George Kaufman and Moss Hart
Broadway hit and a director like Frank
Capra, how could a film miss? This is a
vintage cravy comedy about a family of

, New Yorkers who do exactly what they
want to do in rile, causing their daughter
great consternation when she brings home
her socialite fiancee and his lamily. The
top notch cast is headed by Lionel Bar-
rymore, Jean Arthur and James Stewart.
Cute even touay.

A Boy and His Dog (14.115, 91 min.) a This
science ﬁction, kinky tale of survival has
become something of a cult film or late.
The film follows the adventures of Vic and
his canine Blood as they search for food,
armament and an occasional woman in the
wilderness of the ymr 2024. This oft-beat
vision of future earth promises some good
laugm and an interesting perspective.

Ronald Shannon Jackson to appear Saturday

World renowned drummer and percus
sionist Ronald Shannon Jackson and his
band The Decoding Society will appear
Saturday night at a pm. in Roberts
Theatre. The New York Times said “Mr.
Jackson is one of the most provacative
band leaders now working on the razor’s
edge between free-form, fusion and funk.”
Basically, it is music that concentrates on
counterpoint, with horns, guitars and even
electric basses."

Shannon was voted drummer Most
Deserving Wider Recognition in the 30th
Annual international Jazz Critic‘s Poll.
Gary Giddins, a Grinnell graduate, said in
the March issue or Esquire . . The
Decoding Society is one of the most electri-
lying (bands) in Jazz."

Their music draws upon a number or
various sources. As Shannon himself
noted, “I guess it would be easier to map
out what styles are not present in what we
do v you’ll hear everything irom
Hungarian and classical and polkas, to
rhythm and blues, jazz, rock, funk and
hillbilly. At the bottom of it all is a strong
beat."

Take a trip to 'The Academy'
Actors, Athens and Academia come together

by Bennett laskn

This weekend’s Open Space Production,
The Academy, brings actors, Athens and
academia together in Arena Theatre.

The Academy opened last night and will
play at 8 p.m. tonight and 2 pm. on Satur-
day. According to student writer and
director Michael Glassman, the play is a
tragicomedy loosely based on “what went
on between Plato and Socrates in ancient
Athens, and how Athens corrupted educa-
tion to get what it wanted.” it is a biting
portrayal ol‘ the intrinsic tensions between '
the ideals of pure education and
philosophy and the disdainful but in
escapable realities of money and power.

The play is truly a picture of conﬂicts.
Educators engrossed in the nobility and
eloquence of their profession are counter-
poised with politicians who maneuver
education for their own gain. Meanwhile,

'idealistic students are corrupted by

politics, competition and greed, falling
from innocence and grace to become, as
they are literally portrayed in the play,

A poetic musical, And You Thought

All We Could Do Was Dance, uses the
poems of black poets to fuse a dramatic
scenario of life. People who don’t like
poetry stand up and cheer at the excite-
merit these poems generate. Don’t miss
this exciting production, presented by.
:the Black Liberated Arts renter of
.Oklahorna City 'tonlght inkoberts
Theatre at 8 pm.

 

Glassman wrote the play while studying
oft-campus in India. “it was an escape,”
he said. “Plato. Socrates and comedy are
about as far as you can get from lndia."
He said he had no paru‘cular inspiration
but began with a few characters and a
situation which, over the course of several
months, evolved into a play.

Glassman noted mat because the play is
being performed for the first time, the ac—
tors play a crucial role in transforii-ng the
script into a mature production and in do
ing so, “shape" Hie play itselt. This is a big
responsibility, but the actors rose to the
challenge. Glassman said, “I‘m proud of
my actors; they've added a lot to the
play." Reciprocating the good will, one ac-
tor commented, “I think he wrote a great
play and I‘m proud to be in it."

Studens acting in the production are:
John Grandt, Andy Mennick, Adan-1 Sprr
ingwater, Doug Vickers, Jim Greenberg,
Rich Grinker, Bernadette Connors, Greg
Rahal, Susan Sink, Liz Faulman, Joel
Dubiner and John Nicolson. John Nord-

meyer handled the technical aspects of the
production.

Given the pertinence oi its themes, the
play can be appreciated by anyone and
everyone in the college community. Those
familiar with ancient philosophy may lind
some humor which escapes other viewers,
but the satire functions on many levels,
and there is something appropriate [or
everyone. Professors can empathize with
the plight of The Academy‘s teachers, and
students are likely to join The Academy's
students in their realization that one
doesn‘t get by on education alone because
“there’s no escaping the game."

Virtually everyone has experienced the
conﬂicts illustrated in The Academy and
at some point has had to choose between
maintaining one’s ideals and compromis-
ing with the world’s less noble realities. As
one actor put it, “It eventually comes to a
point where you're eiuier going to be a pig
or not going to be a pig.”
