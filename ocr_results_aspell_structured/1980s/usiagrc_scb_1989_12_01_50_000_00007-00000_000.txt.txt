Ready to Play Kohawks

By Eben Erhard

The Grinnell women’s basketball
team opened the season at the annual
Tip-Off Classic with a new look.

The Pioneers featured a much more
balanced attack, with a mix of inside
and outside play. No longer was the
offense dominated by an inside at»
tack that featured one of the most
dominating front lines in the region.

This attack is led by newcomers
Missy Sharer and Amy Fort, and
sophomore Jennifer Kern. In the
frontcourt, co-captain Laura Van-
Sickleissupportedby Amy Johnson,
Suellen Hageman,Leigh Ashley and
Julie Kaster.

In their first game againstCentral,
Grinnell struggled with inconsis-
tency.

Aftera ﬁrsthalfwherethey looked
nervous on the ﬂoor, the Pioneers
went into the locker room down 28-
20. They came out strong after the
break and took the lead with a 10-1
rally.

But Central fought back and
walked away with a 70-54 victory.

relay in 2:48.36, narrowly missing
last year’srecordby one second,and
Zimsen again teamed up with Nield
and sophomore Todd Smith to win
the 3 x 100 breaststroke relay in a
blazing 3:10.59. The latter trio shat-
tered Grinnell‘s 1988 record by four
seconds.

“We had ﬁne performances both
days," said coach Ray Obermiller.
“We lost Friday by a couple of touch-
outs. Conditioning was a factor,
especially in the distance evean.but
