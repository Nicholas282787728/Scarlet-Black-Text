Christian
Fellowshlp
Enlightens Grinnell

by Christine Black

Christian Fellowship presents both
Christians and noanhristIans a rare op:
portunity to compare and analyze their
religious beliefs according to Meg Litts. an
active member

Grinnell's Fellowship is part ol the Inter:
Varsity Christian Fellowship. an interna-
tional association which sends a represenr
tative every three weeks to lead meetings
and alter guidance to the chapter presi-
dent, Tess Evans.

The Fellowships approximately 40 ac
tive members meet on Tuesday nights to

. discuss different topics each week. In the

past. Leslie Taylor. Intern Chaplain. has
chaired discussions concerning hope and
the path one's lite follows.

To inform members on what will go on at
the large group meetings, the Fellowships
distributes a weekly newsletter to about
120 members. The newsletter. entitled
“The Messenger.” announces potluck din-
ners, retreats, and campus events. The
Fellowship sponsors concerts. recrear

tlonal activities. and discussmns

In addition to these meetings. the
Fellowship sponsors Small Group Bible
Study -l\’leg Litts. a leader lor one of the
seven groups. says the study groups have
rap sessions, discuss hooks. such as
WOMEN AT THE CROSSROADS, and try
to apply the Bible to their lives as college
students A relevant. olten discussed topic
is “the Christian's reaction to people who
‘sin' and the condemnation of the sin and
not the sinner."

Meg believes that Christian Fellowship
members are thought to be Judgmental oi
others. Other students seem to use this
stereotype as an excuse for not associating
with members who ”look down on you if

you haven't ‘lound salvation' or aren't ‘one
of the chosen'."
in Meg's opinion. a Willingness to learn
more about Christianity has increased this
year. Members try to get the Fellowship
more involved with the community. but
”there is still a sense of separation."

SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK FOR
CANCER: IS BEING DONE OUTSIDE THE “B.

us being done by polmments Now, like

‘i‘Akrtists seek “realism.”
beauty,” and “nuances .

of light and color”

by Serge strosberg

More than 8 years after its creation. the
“Negative Space Gallery” serves the
same purpose: to give students a chance to
express their artistic ideas on campus in a
noncompetitive way. In order to Iind it,
you will have to head north instead of south
on the Forum's basement to a place called
"The T race".

It is run by and tor students Any
medium Ior expressing an idea artistically
is acceptable ranging from sculpture and
painting to photographs. The only stipular
tion is to present the artwork in the same
way that you would tor a normal exhibit.

This year. the gallery has displayed the»

artwork oi David Loewenstein. Linda Coflr
man and Kiri Namtvedt. Because of their
different personalities and artistic views.
they have made the “Terrace" a
hetrogeneous gallery to visit.

Here, the artists expressed themselves
orally:

Interviewer: what is yor name?

Artist: David Loewenstein. ‘
Interviewer: What is your favorite col-
or?

Artist: Purple,

interviewer: What is your quest?

Artist: To Seek realism.

As seen in his show “Converting three
dimensions in two without the aid of a
Steamroller,” Lowenstein likes to paint in
oil or draw in pastel things which people
can relate to everday life using harmony in
color to make them look as real as possi»
ble.

For instance. an ARH door. his favorite
piece of the moment, will be painted gray
and drawn geometrically as a symbol oi
scholastic tyranny and coldness. Lowens-
tein's railroad tracks. landscapes or
llowers are not personal souvenirs but
things that common people can recognize

Interviewer- What is your name”
Artist: Linda Coiiman.

lnlevlewer’ what is your favorite color?
Artist: Pink.

Interviewer: what is your quest?
Artist' Beauty. to make every day
beautilul

Collman is not interested in pure
realism. As the name 0| her Show
"Meandering visions in watercolor" sug»
gests. Coffman does not want to stay in one
place when she paints or designs

She experiments with Color when she
paints, She disassembles and reassembles
flowers In what she thinks is the best come
position

Since we spend so much time studying
indoors. Cotiman believes that we should
try seeing beautiful things indoors instead
of dreaming about the outdoors and feeling
depressed.

Interviewer: What is your name?
Artist: Kiri Namtvedt.

Interviewer: What is your iavorite coin
or?

Artist: Black

Interviewer: What is your quest?
Artist: To explore the nuances oi light
and color.

Namtvedt's show “Faces and Figures '
presently on display. shows the artist‘s
strong interest in Contrasts between darks
and lights. Most of her drawings and pain-
tings resemble threerdimensional Iigures
more than two-dimensional photographs.

Many oi her works are selfrportraits or
portraits of the Rock group. The Clash,
This reilects the very personal character
or Namtvedt's work.
