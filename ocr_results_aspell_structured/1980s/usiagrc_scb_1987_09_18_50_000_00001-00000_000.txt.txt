talk about it,

The new addition holds the
Psychology Department on the
ﬁrst two ﬂoors and the Math De-
partment on the third ﬂoor. The
total cost or the new addition
was $3.4 million. This was due
nated by two or three individue
als who wished to remain aiioiiye
mous.

Waldo Walker said, “The Psy~
chology Department had the
worst conditions in which to
work, and two presidents ago
it was already the top prior-
ity." Mr. Brozoslri, the psy—
chology professor most involved
with designing the new build-
ing, said, “In some ways the
old building was a dangerous
building in which to work,"
Goodnow, the former residence
oi the Psychology Department,
was much smaller than the Psyr

ing. When it was built, no one
had any idea of the needs oi
a modern 1987 science tacility.
However, Brozoski said, “the
[new] iacilities were designed as
a modern science building." Not
only did the architect have gripe.
rience in designing academic far
cilities, but, lvlr. Brozoski said,
“we as a department were ins
volved in the planning process."

The Psychology Department
still has lab equipment in Good

now, but thev move sortie of it
every week Brozoski said, “We

anticipate about a year before
we come up to full speed on
all facilities, especially laborato-
ties.“

There were several design over»
sights. “Board illumination
was the major design oversight,"
Erozoski said. The uoiieglare
lighting in the classrooms was so
focused that it did not illumi-
nate the chalkboards well How-
ever, this error has been turned
into an advantage, By installing
a separate strip oiliglits that ile

now possible to rise an overhead
projector iu the dark while be-
ing able to see wellrlit boards

The major construction‘ er-
ror was a poorly installed air-
liaiidlingsystcin which was noisy
and dirl not circulate the. air
to some rooms. Erozocki said,
“By ncl large, the problems and
oversights have becn corrected,"
including the problcin with the
air handling.

Family Planning Center
on its way

by Debbie Chase

The Central lowa Family
Planning Center will open a
clinic in Grinuell this tall in or
der to provide education aucl
health—care services to the com—
munity. They hopc to open the
clinic by November 1.

The center, which is presently
located in Marshalltown, has
ceived much interest from Cri .
iicll residents over the past
rive years about bringing a
clinic here, according to Dinny
Nielson, executive director or
the center. “Through the
clinic, we hope to otter resi-
dents more accessibility to re-
productive health care, birth
control care, prescription and
non-prescription birth control.
and education on sexuality and
iamily life," Nielson said.

Originally intended to open
in collaboration with Crinnell‘s
Jeanne Burkle Women's Center,
the clinic will now be indepen—
dently iun. “We need the in-
dependence so we can equally
serve iricii and womcn." Niclsoii
said. “it we locate in a women‘s
center, we’re not quite as acces-
sible to men, and we feel they
play a role in responsibilities."

Teaming with Criiinell also
posed a problem because the in-
tended site did not orier ader
quote accessibility [or the hands
icapped, Because the center res
ceives federal funding, it must
have accommodations tor the
handicapped.

Nieison cited her goals for the
clinic. She hopes it will make
services accessible to loweincoiue

women and lower the number or
teen pregiiaucics in the area,

Located in ﬁve other couir

designed to build self esteem
and to develop (iecisiolirillakilig
skills. They offer their services
to individual clients, schools,
civic organizations, and hull»
lies. Services include counseling,
written information, and a nliii‘
library which contains ﬁlms on

in order to set up the clinic
in Grinnell, the center received

hinding from federal and state
governments, from the United
Way, and from private dona—
