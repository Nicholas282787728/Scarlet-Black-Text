MagurShak’s- appeal
for tenure denied

by Laura McDermlth '

Assistant Professor oi Philosophy Dan
Magurshak's rirst appeal ior tenure was
denied by the Executive Council on Feb.
19. Magurshak appealed the decision to
deny him tenure on procedural grounds
Since the time ol his lirst appeal, Magure
shak has learned at a second appeal pro
cess,

The personnel Appeals Board will
review Magurshak's case. The board Coils
sists of six faculty members elected for
two-year terms Three members oi the
board will be chosen by lot to decide
whether Magurshak's appeal is justiiied.
The process Should take about three
weeks.

if the board decides against him. Magurr
shak will receive a letter informing him of
the decision and he will have no further op-
portunity to appeal it the board decides in
favor of Magurshak, however. the board
will gain access to all the information in
Magurshak‘s file. From the information,
the board will formulate a recommendar
tion to present to President George Drake.
The board can suggest that Magurshak be
recommended to the Board of Trustees for
tenure. that he not be recommended or
that the issue be tabled until next year
when Magurshak can once again become
eligible for tenure, Drake will. in eflect.
make the final decision since the trustees
generally iollow the recommendations or
the president.

Magurshak is still unsure of the reasons
tor the denial oi his application lor tenure.
Information regarding the justification for
the denial has had to be ferreted outi ac
cording to Magurshak. Grinnell is no (life
ferent than other institutions in the way
they handle personnel problems said
lliagurshak. The American Association oi

University Professors does not require an
institution to justify tenure decisions

Magurshak is appealing because he can-
not justify his denial. "I'm not satisfied
that it was the fair thing to do." he said
"Anybody who's denied tenure feels
wronged." Magurshak is willing to hear
exactly why he was denied tenure out as
yet has “not round any viable evidence "

The Executive Council suggested last
year that Dean oi raculty Catherine
Frazer interview laculty members soon to
be eligible tor tenure. Last March or April.
Magurshak was interviewed by Frazer
She recommended to Magurshak that he
do more research. No complaints or pro»
biems about his teaching were presented
at the interview.

When asked to confirm the rumor that
George Apostle. proiessor emeritus oi
mathematics. submitted an annotated
paper of Magushak's to the Executive
Board. Magurshak said. “Yes. it did hape
pen." Magurshak was reluctant to discuss
the situation, because oi his upcoming ap-
peal. Apparently. Apostle obtained a copy
of some of Magurshak‘s notes and added
comments of his own in the margins. Aposr
tie presented the annotated Version of the
notes to the Executive Council. The notes
were not an uiiicai entry in Magurshak’s
file but they received a great deal oi
discussion at the council's meeting.

"It is important that the college. ioi- its
own sake. get very clear the questions that
have to be answered about the tenure and
the appeal process." said Magurshak. The
faculty is watching Magurshak's case
because they are concerned about its
possible implications. according to Magur-
shak

Errors in constitution
prompt reVIsion

by Jeff kavmond

The present Student Government
Association constitution. which has been in
eiiect since is is undergoing a revision
and reorganization this semester. Harley
Liker and Bill McCullough past presidents
oi Cowles and South Younker Halls respece
tively. are being retained on the Student
Rules Committee to head the reorganiza~
tion

Liker and McCullough are staying on
despite the iact that they were not
reelected to the SGA. They are lamiliar
with the constitution and Mark Salmanson.
who last semester headed the SRC but did
not return this semester. recommended
them ior the position. Said McCullough.
"It would have been a mistake to let so
meonc who wasn't iamiliar with the cone
stitution do the revision "

McCullough and Liker plan to make the
revision process open to the student
population through announcements in the
Memo. open iorums on constitutional
issues and through articles in the Slut.
Liker stressed the importance oi keeping
the reorganization process open to student
input, “We're not going to go behind closed
doors and come out later and say. ’Here
people. this is your constitution ' it e really
want student involvement "

The constitution exists only to set
guidelines tor the running oi the SGA. The
constitution must not. however. contradict
the Student llilildlmok which super-codes it
in any discrepancy, The students are at:
lected by the constitution only in the sense
that it controls the SGA and the son at-
iccts the students McCullough admitted
that the role or the constitution in the
students everyday lives is . fairly loose"
and "kind of liarmlcss' Liker Silirl that
the students would notice the chances in
the constitution only because the 5m

would run more smoothly and efficiently
The constitution does not and will not say

anything about the policy oi the SGA or.

make any ideological statements.

Both McCullough and Liker said that the
biggest problems with the constitution are
discrepancies both within its framework
and wtth the Student Handbook. They plan
to find out exactly what the present duties
of the SGA officers are and to put these in
to the constitution instead of whatever
may be in it now. They also cite some in
consistencies thorughout the constitution
which include the eligibility requirements
for olfice. Liker said that he also would
like to see some of the outdated or
superfluous information taken out and
unclear wording changed. "A lot 01 little
things and some big inconsistencies.” is
how leer described what he and Men
Cuilough were going to try to change

Should there be enough student interest
on changing part oi'the constitution so that
It disagrees with the handbook. President
George Drake must be consulted and he
must approve the change. Liker and Mc
Cullough said that it there is enough sup
port tor a resonabie reVision. the siic
should ha\e little trouble getting the hand-
book changed

50 l'ar there has been good student input
for ideas for the revision. Most of those in'
