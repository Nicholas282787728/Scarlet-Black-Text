Ant°-core curriculum
arguments

The reinstitution of core curriculums seems to be becoming a trend in
schools around the country. We were given some good reasons for a core
curriculum by Robert Viscusi from Brooklyn College at the convocation
last week, but here are some ideas against a core which the faculty and
administration should consider:

Many students feel that for the amount of tuition they are paying to
Grinnell they should be able to choose whatever courses they wis . Con-
nected with this view is the opinion that a school of Grinnell’s caliber
ought to admit students who know the value of a liberal education and
are willing to seek one out for themselves That is, they feel they are
smart enough to choose a liberal selection of courses for themselves.

The advisory system ought to be improved before going so far as to in-
stitute a core curriculum, The college could ensure mat all advisors
have ample knowledge of divisions other than their own, including
courses they may or may not advise their students to take.

Devising a core curriculum seems a very difficult thing to do. How
would a curriculum committee decide what criteria to use when
deciding the extent of a core and its content'.7 How would a body deter-
mine what is best for everyone to know? And how would it ensure that
the core courses are not too simple for some or too difficult for others?

Simply because a student has not taken a course in a certain subject
does not mean he or she is ignorant of that topic, either. Since a Grinnell
education promotes the development of “analytical and critical
thought," according to President Drake in his paper about his ideas for
the future of Grinnell, students here ought to be able to read on their own
and gain knowledge from this reading without taking an entire course on
a subject.

Finally, the institution of a core curriculum would alter the character
of Grinnell’s student body. If the current students had wanted a struc-
tured curriculum they would not have elected to come here. Many of us
are here because the freedom to choose our own courses appealed to us.
Grinnell was seen as a liberal college because it allowed students this
freedom. However, by imposing a core requirement the college will be
changing its image so much that it will appeal to an entirely different set
of people.

Get rid of those trees!

When the trees were first introduced to Cowles ﬂiey seemed an in-
teresting addition, not necessarily good, but interesting. The lants,
shrubbery and trees, as well as banners gave Cowles an entire y new
look, which was the general idea. However, the trees, in particular, have
proven to be a problem.

Traffic flow of'tray-bearing pedestrians is bad enough in the dining
hall Without the added obstacle course, the trees. Taller people have to
stoop to pass under the branches and the rest of us have trouble simply
getting around the trees, trying not to hit the salad bar or other people in
the process.

One of the trees is even too tail to live in Cowles. Right now its top
branches are curving and the whole tree is leaning because the ceiling is
in its way.

When trees are inside, are they supposed to lose their leaves during
the fall? The Cowles trees certainly are. Leaves can form a slippery
hazard on a polished floor, and how do the janitors feel about having to
rake leaves inside?

It is often the case that outdoor ﬂora, when transplanted indoors, has
to undergo a decline and revival period. So when the Cowles trees first
began to droop and lose their leaves we thought it was only a part of the
natural process. It was a part of a natural process — death. How long
will it be now before these dead trees are removed from Cowles Dining

Why l wear a Walkman

1 was walking across campus about two
weeks ago listening to my Sony Walkman
when a friend came up to me nodding his
head in disapproval. i took oil the ear-
phones and asked him what was the mat.-
ter. He wasted no time in informing me of
his extreme displeasure lor “that thing"
on my ears Yesterday, I was dressed
rather nicely in what you might call my
“Sunday best.” Again I noticed that many
people were displeased with my choice ol
clothing, Why am i telling you all or these
rather dull little anecdotes? (Oh God}
We’re going to get another interpretation
of nothing events!) Well I’ll tell you. I’ve
noticed recently among many Grinnell
students a tendency to cast their liberal
ideas in stone. In other words, many of us
have taken our liberal points of view too
far by creating what 1 will call a “liberal
dogma.”

This dogma is characterized by a total
displeasure on me part oi the liberals for
anything which does not meet his or her
standards of liberalism. Let's get back to
the Walkman and the clothes. When my
friend saw me with the earphones on, he
immedlately assumed I had become a narr
cissistic monster seeking only my own
pleasure and isolation from the world. He
saw the Walkman as the ultimate, in-
dividualist machine and me as the
ultimate individualist. Well, he was wrong,
I wasn’t wearing the tape player to isolate
myself from anyone or anything. I wear a
Walkman because I enjoy muSlc and 1 en-
joy taking music to places where one
wouldn’t normally think to bake it. Have
you ever gone to the bathroom to the
strains of The Doors or the Rolling Stones?

It’s an intense experience. It gives a whole
new dimension to sitting on the pot (excuse
the crudity). Or how about riding a bicycle
while listening to Bartok or Stravinsky. In
addition, many people assume that since
you have earphones on, you will probably
ignore them when they pass. It really
freaks them out when you Say “hello”
anyway. They don't know what to do.

How about clothes? For Pete’s sake, just
because someone wears a nice pair of
pants and nice clothes doesn't mean
they’ve gone preppy! I was dressed up
simply because I wanted to be in
something other than blue jeans, The point
of the matter is dogmatic liberals are far
too willing to assume people have taken
the step toward “Rum, Reaganism, and
Ruin.” To put it into a cliche, they “judge a
book by its cover." Indeed, a true liberal
shouldn't attempt to judge anyone. A true
liberal is open to all people and ideas
regardless of their relative merit or
demerits. We are supposed to have an
enlightened and open-minded student
body, not necessarily a liberal one. There’s
a big difference, You can be the most
liberal thinker in the world and still have a
closed mind. The same is true oi conser-
vatives, {or people with high ideals are
some of the most stubborn individuals in
the world. All you have to do is convince
yourself that yours in the right way of
thinking and that everyone else is full of
crap.

But let‘s set aside these petty issues for a
moment and go to the academic solar
plexis — core curriculum. The theory
behind core curriculum is that this college
must assure that its students are liberally

Signature soliciting
annoying

To the Editor:

This morning I got up early to go and
study in the peace and quiet of the library
away irom the distractions and interrup-
tions of dorm life. Before long I was ac-
ousted by a member of the South Airican
Support Group asking tor my signature on
a divestment petition. This was the second
time I had been approached in the library
as well as countless times in die lunch line.
While I understand the frustrations and
dedication of oils group, I resent their tac-
tics, which in these instances remind me of
overeager army recruiters. More imporr
tantly, however, this continued pestering
has served to alienate me from their cause
rather than enlist my support. I think Grinr
nell’s South African Support Group has
done a commendable job in reaching the
student population, providing information
and confronting the trustees. However,
their actions become annoying when they
attempt to solicit support in places which
are no place tor espousing political opir
nion. — Betti Scheiske

Response to
homophobia charge

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to John Kerr’s ar-
ticle last week about homophobia at Grin-
nell. As the adviser to the Younker Hall
Council both last year and this, I would like
to take strong issue with John’s
characterization of the Younker Hallo»
ween Party as being conceived in
homophobia. We did not intend last year to
“offer an alternative" party but rather to
plan a good time, period. Whether GCGC
was having a party or not wasn’t much of a
consideration, except mat we elected to
start our party earlier so people could
have time at BOTH of them. I personally
resent being characterized as a “Younkers
homophobe," and I'd wager that resent-
ment is felt by most others who lived in

Younker last year and who live here now.
You have friends in Younker Hall, John;
you would do well not to alienate us.

Homophobia IS a problem, even here at
Grinnell, and I don‘t mean to minimize
that problem. But, John, you are looking
for homophobia where it does not exist.
This year there was great clamor to repeat
last year’s well-attended and well-liked
Younker Halloween Party. We initially
wanted to have our party on Saturday
night so as NOT to conflict with the GCGC
party. However, because Black Cultural
Weekend was to include a Darby band
Saturday night, we would not have been
funded by SGA if we competed with that
event.

In the future, all of us would do well to
check with the individuals involved before
making public accusations to the campus
community. An article such as John‘s
serves further to polarize people here, not
bring us closer together. — Donna R.
Savage, Resident Adviser

To the Editor:

1 am writing in response to John Kerr’s
article concerning Younker Homophobes.
I happen to share Mr. Kerr’s concern that
there is a decreasing awareness and ac»
cepmncc of divergent litestyles on this
campus. However, it is blind accusau‘ons
like Mr. Kerr’s that create obstacles for
communication and understanding. If Mr.
Kerr’s approach to problem solving is
representative of the Grinnell community
in general, then we should prepare for in-
creasing intolerance {or divergent
lifestyles,

As a member of both this and last year’s
Younker Hall Council I deeply resent Mr.
Kerr’s attack on uie Younker party. The
party was not conceived as an alternative
to me ococ party In fact, we originally
scheduled our party for Saturday in order
to prevent the resulting conflict. However,
because the CBS Halloween party was also
scheduled for Saturday, we had to
reschedule our party tor Friday, n we
hadn't rescheduled men we would not have
received funding from SGA, The Younker
party was scheduled tor Friday with the
interest of the entire Campus. Every stu-
