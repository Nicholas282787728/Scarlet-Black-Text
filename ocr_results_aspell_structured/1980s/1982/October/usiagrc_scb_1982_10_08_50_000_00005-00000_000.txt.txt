QUICK FILM SUMMARY For those ttf
you who didn't see it. the film includes a
critical scene ina public park in Germany.
not long before the outbreak of World War
II. A German youth begins singing
“Tomorrow Belongs To Me," The camera
pans away, revealing that the blonde teen
is in fact a Nazi brownshirt. As the song
builds, more and more of those picnickers
join voices to the choir Throughout the
scenes, the camera cuts from face to face
with increasing speed, building tremens
dous tension that climaxes with the
brownshirt‘s Nazi salute at song's end

This scene is a super, metaphorical
summary of Nazism's spread, and of the
hypnotic power Nazism had over the
essentially innocent, good-minded.
common people of Germany. This scene
was also ruined Saturday night by one
student's insistence on hissing, LOUDLY.
every time the Nazi youth appeared on the
screen. Given that, as the scene builds, the
camera returns to the boy continuously,
the anonymous heckler robbed the
sequence of any tension, drama or power.

As with the James Bond film. the
majority oi the film's audience was
treated disrespectfully, Unlike the earlier
film, there is an issue here deeper than
proper manners, common courtesy or
concern for others' safety and property, I
am sure that the heckler at Cabaret was
delighted at being able to display his anti-

fascist tendencies. [ am distrubed that. in

Memories absent
from yearbook

To the Editor:

It was a long time ago. Most of this
year’s freshmen were freshmen in high
school then. I’m talking about the first
week of classes in August of 1978, Allow me
to indulge in a bit of reminiscence before
coming to the point, My memory is spotty
on those days but I do remember the
moment I realized things here at college
were going to be very diiierent, l‘d have to
study for instance. And the people. Not just
the four kinds l‘d known in high school
t jocks, queenies, heads and bookwormsl
but. all sorts from, I was certain, galaxies
away. All to be treated with the care due to
aliens with unknown potential for good or
evil. Wow, E.T.

I met one guy on the first Monday in Mr,
Moore’s ancient world class. This guy was
big even then although many kegs and
much iron later made him “youge.” My
first impressions were of his large gold
ring with M.C on it, his White teeth and
glossy black hair. So polite It kind of
figured he'd be a red-neck, I overlooked
that for the Sake of friendship.

We shared friendship, laughs, beers and
friends. I was in Mr, Kintner’s tutorial'onl
feudal warfare when 1 meta friend of his. I
can’t focus on my first impressions of this
fellow now because at the time I was too

busy trying to beawake to pay much at
tention to the class or classmates Suffice
to say we too became friends. probably on
the basis of each one being one of the first
people the other had met on campus.
Even more likely, on the basis of not
suiieririg instant revulsion or anything
upon meeting.

On one particulary beery evening i
recall bidding these fellows a beer-faced
farewell from The Pub, Those two brave
gladiators would sally forth the next day to
do battle upon the field of football in some
far away burg, So I, feeling the need to
make'the app’ropria'te‘g'asture 'of parting to
soldiers who might not return, did my best
to place a boozy kiss upon their fuzz-eyed
tacos. Not unlike slapping them ‘cross the
face with a wet fish, None of us knows if it
was fun or if the game was won or if l'm
making this up but friends can forget as
well as remember.

From here it looks like years. Butrwhen
we were seniors it was as if the day before
we were new. Because just yesterday we
were stepping on each other’s toes at The
Waltz or in the weight room. yelling
ourselves hoarse in Rawson or at a track
meet. I was just sitting on your lap
drinking birthday shots, Mike. 0r making
you a pillow, Marc, on the way to OJ
country. So it kind of fits that when the
time for our senior yearbook pictures were
to be taken we agreed to have it taken
together — we three friends After you
vetoed my loony suggestions we decided to

get dressed up recally snazzy and stand by
the P.E.C. 7 our second home. 0.K., third
home. I didn’t think of The Pub.

1 just remembered I promised to get to
the point. i hope you guys have some good
memories because the yurbook picture,
didn’t make it to print. Maybe ours was’
supposed to be where they put that second
picture of Ben. Or even on one of those
keen blank pages. What hurts is not that
my picture isn't in there. it is, a couple of
times even. Once, they even spelled my
name right. But WE are not in there, and
that bites like an early frost. Just
remember. Please. ~ With tequila breath,
