Against SM letter to Fl‘ﬂZBl‘

To the Editor:

The SGA resolution reﬂects the unfor-
tunate prejudices shared by many
Students as well as considerable ignorance
of college administration. Moreover, it will
only exacerbate the tensions now existing
between students and other segments of
the college community. It will impede atr
tempts to alleviate this situation through
understanding and reconciliation, for it
will only further excite the air of confron-
tation and self-righteousness which so
permeates the student body. The SGA has
presented the wrong statement at the
worst possible time and has exercised poor
judgement in the midst of a delicate at-
mosphere . . .

The selfrrighteous and polemical tone of
the statement reveals the deepseated pres
judices behind it The SGA condemns the
dean for breaching an
guideline of the Executive Council. It at-
cuses her of wanting to eliminate courses
in phenomenology and existentialism 7 a
crass distortion of the observations of the
Wall Committee. Lastly, it sets itself up as
judge, jury and hangrnan, condemning
Ms. Frazer solely on information released
by her adversaries. The administration
has followed the universally accepted
norm of not discussing personnel decisions
in public; its opponents have not. The SGA,
claiming to base its arguments on facts,
actually depends on a subjective, one
sided rendition of recent events . .

The faculty has justly censured SGA,
showing that the student government,
representative of the student body, has
driven a wedge between that body and the
faculty. We cannot afford such needless
division now! Students must learn mat
honest communication requires give and
take on both sides.» They-are primarily
responsible for the “information gaps" by
refusing to listen and for the ”lack of stu-
dent input" by presenting views not worth
hearing. The stridency of the students and
the SGA thereby cripples the charts of
organizations (such as the South Africa
Support Group) who have worthwhile
causes to advance In the words of one
sage of American culture: “We have met
the enemy 7 and he is us! " 7 Sincerely,
Michael Hofstetter

To the Campus Community:

We, the student members of the Cur-
riculum Committee, are perplexed by the
letter submitted by the SGA calling for the
resignation of Dean F‘razer from one of her
positions (May 5, 1982), We are also puzzl-
ed as in why SGA chose Dean Frazer as the
scapegoat [or their frustrations. In our ex-
periences this semester working with the
dean, we have found her to be a responsi-
ble and open-minded individual . . . ,

The recent letter by the SGA seems to
typify the unfounded and inaccurate
statements made by Students in recent
open forums. The dean, in fact, does not
have the iinal say on curriculum matters,
which include » job descriptions. Any

change in job descriptions or departmen-
tal course offerings must first meet with
the approval of department members and
student EPC'S.

It is exactly the type of irresponsibility
evident in the SGA'S letter which prevents
the SGA and students from being taken
seriously. If students wish to get involved
in curriculum and tenure concerns, they
should utilize the EPC system to its fullest
extent, rather than blindly attacking a col-
lege administrator. — Sincerely, Philip

To the Editor:

To avoid the confusion between allusion
and theft, the students concerned about
plagiarism in the score of the Uhu plays,
rather than anonymously publish accusa-
tion and threat, might more appropriately
have approached those of us involved in
the production,

We were well aware of the rich texture of
musical quotation, and found it entirely
complementary to the spirit or parody in
Jarry‘s text. Our composer and lyricist,
Rich Grinker, quite rightly knew that
musical satire depends on allusmns which
echo the previous musical experience of its
audience; the success of satire rests on the
ease with which an audience can recognize
similar motifs and go on to acknowledge
thercomic disparity between the original
and the parody.

We need, I think, to maintain a critical
distinction between plagiarism and allus
sion, between theft and the individual arr
tist's use and manipulation of tradition for
comic purposes. . . ,

Rather than carp about possible
plagiarism, it seems to us that the authors
of last week's letter might better have en-
joyed the clear success of Rich's music
and exercised more ingenuity in tracking
down all the omer allusions, - Ellen
Mease, Sandy Moffett, Jan Czechowski

To the Editor:

The student concerned with plagiarism
failed to recognize the other parodies in
Uhu (“Rocky Horror Picture Show,”
“West Side Story,” Mozart, Springsteen
and CCR). — Rich Grlnker

The sad; apologizes for printing the
letter about possible plagiarism in the
Hon plays in the May 7, 1982 issue
without the names of its authors. In the
future, no letters to the editor will be
printed without the full names of those
who wrote them.

From Isen allli WOI'IGV

Dear Students:

Having resigned my position in the
philosophy department, 1 will not be here
next fall. My four years of teaching here
have been very rewarding, and I thank
you, the students and the members of the
philosophy department, for making them
so. ItJlink it is very likely that I will never
again rind a more challenging, alert,
critical and concerned group of students to
teach. It is certain that I will never again
have the privilege of working in a depart
ment from which I will benefit as I have
the philosophy department. My colleagues
have been superb.

There have been many times this
semester when l have become painfully
aware of how much lam giving up in leav—
ing Grinnell College. As students you are
not only capable of being critical, you have
the patience and the concern to raise good
questions and the tenacity to demand good
answers. I have felt pride in being
associated with students who are willing to
hold open forums on issues of longterm
concern to this school, to take the time to
circulate petitions seeking change and to
march for divestment, to take but a few ex-
amples.

Unfortunately, you have yet to receive
adequate answers to your questions. You
have presented cogent arguments and
those arguments have not been refuted.
You have been asked to rely upon faith
rather thanreason and judgment and to
trust in the administration in the face of

To the Editor:

I was flattered to be the subject of an ar-
ticle in the April 30 edition of the 55:13, but
must set the record straight on two points:

First, 1 did not “supervise the entire
Kansas City star team" during coverage
of the Hyatt Regency disaster last July, 1
supervised the team that handled compilar
tinn of information on the dead and in-
jured, one of many, many teams of
reporters and editors who handled a wide
variety of assignments. Also, my work on
the structural aspects of “18 story was
much more limited than the story implied
7 two other members of our staff, Torn
Watts and Rick Aim, deserve the credit for
that effort,

Second, I am not covering the story of
Penni Crabtree and her detention at a
missile site near Whiteman Air Force
Base. I have been extremely active in this
matter, but in my role as Region 7 freedom
of information director for the Society of
Professional Journalists 7 Sigma Delta

considerable evidence that the administra-
tion has erred. l have sympathy with your
frustration in the [ace of ﬂiese replies,
since i have asked the same questions and
received the same nonanswers. I can only
hope that you will persist in your errorts
and remember that criticism and the pur-
suit of truth have nev‘er been easy or
popular occupations.

My decision to leave Grinnell is,
ultimately, a personal one. The philosophy
department has been in errect destroyed;
our academic freedom abridged and our
judgments ignored. I am not inclined to
stay and work to rebuild, since I have no
faith that it would not be destroyed once
again. As a logician [am not much given to
accepting matters of importance on faith,
especially when reason tells me that the
administration has dealt with the
philosophy department in bad iaith. 7

To the Editor:

A number of years ago, in addition to
my teaching duties, l was instructed by
ﬁle college to build an excellent
philosophy department. It now appears
that I built a better department than the
college wanted or than the college
deserved, I apologize to all who have
been harmed by my actions. 7 Jack

SASG. Your criticisms of our position
paper were cruel and remain unfound-
ed. Your whimsical dismissal of our
documentation was entirely outside me
intellectual spirit of Grinnell, One year
ago we brought Dennis Brutus to Grin
nell so that you could speak to him as
you do your own sources, You showed
no interest.

I have learned from meeting with you
that you are not interested in
“documented cases" or ethical con»
siderations‘, but rather power. If I
should have the opportunity to do
business with you again, that lesson will
be firmly emplaced in my mind. 7
