Campus adiusis to GTE

recdbling

236-6181 now just a memory

by Kim MacDonald

At a cost of $250,000, the college has in-
smiled a completely new telephone and
PBX system which became operational on
Aug. 15.

According to the trustee’s firm which
researched the project, GTE gave the col»
lege a “very good deal." As a result oi the
recent deregulation of the telephone in-
dustry, the college now owns the over a
quarter of a million dollars worth of cable
which lies buried in the freshly covered
tunnels that crisscross the campus.

Dean of Student Attairs Jim Tederman
explained that the firm which researched
the proposed recabling oi the campus
estimated that it would cost the college
almost twice U’lis amount in two years.
“Actually, we're quite late in changing
over,” explained Tederman, since many
other colleges in the country already have
a similar system.

Although some phones have been placed
in the wrong oitices, others don‘t ring, and
many calls tend to get lost in the un-
iamiliar transter process, Tederman
thinks that the system is working ”pretty
well." Because the change occurred in the
span of only one weekend, Tederman says,
“it does not surprise me at all it some pm,
blems don't develop,”

Reduced operation of the main swite
chboard is a concern oi many students.
Until the student directory is published, it
is necessary to call the campus operator
(or directory information, which becomes
diilicult when the operator goes ott duty.
The new switchboard will remain open
from ti am. to 10 pm. on weekdays, from B
to 3 p.m. on Saturdays and will be closed
all day Sunday. The town operator has
listings {or ball phones, but not individual
listings.

Because of these reduced hours the col-
lege has created a new emergency system.
when the switchboard closes, a recorded
message gives an emergency number
which students, parents or anyone else
may call in case of dire emergency. The
number reaches a portable telephone
which the night watchman carries at all
times. Since portable phones transmit via
the air waves, the FCC has regulated that
calls must be automatically cut off alter
three minutes. Thus, in the span of three
minutes, the night watchman must take
the message, which he later takes direcﬂy
to the student’s room. In addition, each
night one or the college deans is on call.

Under the old system deans carried a
beeper which the campus operator used to
notiiy them in case of emergency. Now the
deans carry walkie talkies which allow the
duo to hear any action on the emergency
number, Tederman says that this system
works very well and has already been
helpful. Tederman cited one instance when
he was on the walkie talkie and overheard
a call from a mother about an emergency
which the night watchman did not know
how to handle. Tederman sees the poten
tial for this system to be abused, but he
hopes that the night watchman won't be
running all around campus.

In addition to direct dial calling from the
dorms, Students can now obtain their own
private dorm phones, just as they would in
their own homes or apartments. At a cost
or $49.70, Tederman thinks, “the price
structure is pretty steep,” and both he and
a supervisor from GTE estimate that only
about 100 or so students will request the
private phones at this time. A woman at
the GTE desk in the post office noted that
she felt students were overwhelmed by the
cost of their books and simply could not at-
ford a phone at this time. As of Wednesday
afternoon, only 48 students requested
private phones. However it appears that
those students didn’t mind spending the
money. Orange, chocolate brown and
ivory were the most popular colors [or the
designer phones which cost even more
than the standard desk phone. Although
GTE required various credit and personal
information, the supervisor in the post at-
tice said that they did not request deposits
from any students. She added that all the
people in the post ottice had a good time
working there with the students, and they
hoped to take orders lor 70 phones.

The installation charges of 548.70 is a one
time only charge for the cost of the cable. a
charge similar to that [or wiring a new
house. Students who draw into rooms next
year which are already wired can have
phones installed in them at a substantially
lower price. The current charge for ottr
campus installation in a wired house is
currently about $28.00. Tederman expects
that in about two years almost every room
on campus will be wired {or private
phones. He sees the possibility of private
phones ringing all night, but unlike the
campus phone system which shuts off a;
12:30 a.m., the college can not control
private phones. Contrary to rumors cire
culating around campus, it is possible to
callout on hall phones alter 12:30 a.m, and
private campus phones do not shut off at
12:30 am. The physical plant does not
automatically cut the lines it a student is
on the phone at shutoff time and now
students can talk as late'as they want if
their call begins before 12:30 am.

in an all campus memo Tederman warn-
ed students with private phones that they
should look their rooms when they leave
their rooms to prevent other people from
using their phones. Apparently this is a
major problem at colleges with similar
systems such as Carlton College. “As a
whole, students are a good group when it
comes to phones", claimed Tederman, and
he added that with “all the computeriza-
tion it is very hard to commit phone fraud
these days.”

The college chose not to allow students to
use their own store bought phones when in-
stalling phones to protect against the then
of college owned phones. Since the college
now owns all phones on campus, It wanted
the option at protecting its own property by
authorizing installation of phone lines,

Soon mom will be a bygone memory,
and hopetully the constant complaints or
“We just got a new phone system and I
don't know how to work it. . .” will be an
echo of the past,

Dorms less crowded
this year

As of Wednesday, Aug. 25, Grinnell's
enrollment for this semester was 1,192.
”We don’t have the numbels we did last
year.” said Assistant Dean of Student
Affairs and Director at Student Housing
Bob Towner-Larsen, “even though, the
dorms are still pretty full."

TownerrLarsen said the dorms are
not as crowded now as they were last
year even though fewer students are
livmg off-campus in nonrcollege owned
housing than usual. About 150 students
are living in oitcampus college-owned
housing and do others are participating
in ofiumpus programs.

We houses on Park Street, 1131 and
1233, are now administrative offices.

Some spaces were lost in the Cowles
Hall renovation this summer but addi-
tional rooms were created in Clark
basement. The college will be finished
with major dorm renovations alter me
work on Haines is completed,

Oldest alumnus dies

Charles H. Haines, formerly Grin-
nell’s oldest living alumnus, died July
21 in Denver, Colo. He was 105 years
old. A philosophy major while at Grin-
nell, Haines also worked on the student
newspaper and was a member or the
Phi Beta Kappa honor society. He
graduated lrom Grinnell in 1898,
studied law at the University of Iowa
and received his LLB. from Harvard
Law School in 1904. He served as assis-
tant city attorney for the city oi Denver.
Both oi his parents were graduates oi
the college as were his two sisters and
three brothers.

New washers, dryers
use chips

One of the changes made on campus
this summer was the installation of ad-
ditional washers and dryers. Thse
machines, located in Dibble, Younker,
Loose and Gardner Lounge, use a
plastic chip system instead of change.

Students must buy the chips in lots of
10 for $4 in the Bookstore or the Forum
Grill In the orginal plans students
could buy chips only at the Bookstore,
but nuw students may purchase them at
the Grill when the Bookstore is closed.

Two reasons {or the change are to
prevent non-college people from using
the machines, which are cheaper than
those in town, and to avert vandalism of.
the machines. James Tederman, vice
president and dean of student affairs,
said the college is not trying to make a
proiit tram the machines. He said the
new price {or the chips will pay only the
operating costs.

Obvious noncollege people, such as
"an 85-year-old woman,” will not be
able to purchase the chips, Tederman
said, but he expects some town peop’,r
wzll still be able to buy them. As ye!
Tederman has heard no student com-
ment on the new machines. He suspects
some students may resell chips during
times when neither the Bookstore nor
Grill are open.
