Judicial Council advise strict sentenc ~—

by Ellen Heat
Judicial Council, in its first case of the

year. heard at 3 am. Saturday, Sept. 4,
found a member of the residential campus
community guilty of tampering with the
fire alarm system in a dormitory. in viola-
tion of the rule stated on page 64 oi the Stu-
dent Handbook.

on Aug. 3i, Mark Bradshaw, in his role
as Student Government Association vice
president, brought the charges against the
defendant on behalf of the student body.
When Bradshaw told the Judicial Council
of the case it had not yet met for its initial
organizational meeting, but the membeis
gathered on Sept. 1 to choose a chair and
learn the preliminary facts of the case.

According to Judicial Council Chairpen
son Rick Richardson, the defendant, whom
Richardson declined to name, was
awakened in me night by a fire alarm
sounding. The defendant got up and hit the
alarm breaking the ceiling tile to which the
alarm was attached. The alarm then
dangled from the cei 'ng by a cord and the
defendant hit it again.

Although dislodged, the fire alarm was
not impaired. Richardson said the defen-
dant pleaded not guilty to the charge of
tampering with the fire alarm system
because the alarm itself was undamaged.

After deliberating, however, the Judicial
Council tound him guilty of the charge.
The council then sent a three-part sentence

SGA, Tedermon work out security proposal

by Cara Stein

, Dean of Student Affairs .lim Tederman
made an appearance at Wednesday’s
meeting or the Joint Board and prompted a
lengthy discussion of the student security
force for allrcampus parties.

Tederman explained the main purpose
of these security guards would be to pre-
vent non-eollege students and/or minors
from the town of Grinnell from attending
college parties. Tederman added that big
events such as Darby parties which usual»
ly hire name bands often attract outsiders
looking for free entertainment and beer. In
the past, organizers of Grinneli allrcampus
parties have hired student security but
they were very lenient about checking
identification and tended to abandon their
posts after a few beers. It is the hope of the
Student Affairs Office that paying a per-
manent set of students a $3.50 per hour
wage and providing steady employment
will encourage the guards to work more ef-

New mopeds

by Marg Tozer

The purchase of two mopeds by the
Physical Plant has made the life of some
Building and Grounds Plant workers
easier. In early August Physical Plant
bought the Honda Mopeds from a cycle
store in Fella, Iowa.

Because of their greater mobilization.
mopeds are more practical for use on a
college campus than walking or using a
truck. Mopeds are quick and can go almost
anywhere.

During the day, B&G workers use the
mopeds for small errands, including trips,
repair, deliveries and messages. From 3
pm. to 4 am, the mopeds are assigned to

recommendation to President Drake,
First it advised that the defendant be sub
ject to conduct probation in keeping with
page 37 of the Student Handbook. This
passage states that:

Conduct probation is a recognition of a
very serious lack of Cooperation in citizen-
ship or a serious or repeated violation of a
college regulation. This probation is a war-
ning that a person's status as a student at
Grinnell College is in jeopardy and that
any further violation may result in suspenr
sion from the College.

Richardson explained that the second
point included the stipulation on the first
part that “Any further violation having to
do with the fire alarm system will result in
(the defendant‘s) dismissal from Grinnell
College."

Thirdly, the Judicial Council called for
immediate revocation of the defendant’s
privilege to live in the residence halls.
Under this sentencing, he would have two
weeks to find other housing and move out
of the dormitory.

The council made additional recommene
dations to Drake including the suggestion
that the president have a personal con-
ference with the defendant, It also advised
Drake to send a message to the rest of the
members of that hall warning them of the
danger of tampering with fire alarms.

Richardson said the reason for such

ficiently and responsibly.

Tedeiman pointed out three major
reasons why the security system should be
organized and maintained by SGA funds.
First, Tederman stated the outsiders who
come in often looking tor a tight usually
tend to disturb parties causing damage to
campus property. The tab for this kind of
violent vandalism is inevitably picked up
by dorm funds and is pulled from the SGA
budget. Second, Tederman feels that it is
the responsibility of students and ad»
ministration to protect people at these par-
ties from physical violence,

lastly, Tederman pointed out that it is
the student money that is invested in these
events and StudenB should want to protect
their own interests by providing a safe,
pleasant atmosphere at parties.

Many members of Joint Board were
curious about the procedure for picking
the security guards and how the finances

increased service and shorter response
times are two improvements seen since
the mopeds arrived. In addition, mopeds
use less fuel. A moped uses two gallons of
gas per Week, while a truck would use fifty
gallons per week. The savings are obvious.

The disadvantage of the mopeds is that
they cannot be used in snow and cold
weather. However, whenever condiu‘ons
are favorable the mopeds will be in use.

The future of mopeds on campus is in-
sured, especially since their arrival has
been well received by all.

 

harsh sentencing was that the defendant
did not recognize ”the gravity of the situae
tionr . . He didn't seem to realize that those
things (fire alarms) are more than toys.”

The chairperson added, “We felt
mroughout the proceedings that the defen-
dant didn‘t understand the purpose of fire
alarms." The sentencing advised was
strict in hopes of impressing upon the
defendant the importance of fire alarms
and the seriousness of his action.

After deciding on a guilty verdict the
Judicial Council also took into account the
fact that the defendant had, as Richardson
said, “a slight past history. . . of problems
with fire alarms.” He claimed the
previous trouble was “enough to merit
some consideration. "

Richardson said Drake would receive
the Judicial Council's recommendations
’hiesday morning, Sept. 7. Within 48 hours
he must have acted on the case, The presie
dent can alter the sentencing but may not
reverse the verdict At this writing Drake
did not want to comment on the situation.

Other members of the Judicial Council
are students Guy Montag, Derek Vroom,
Bernadette Connors and Craig Rasile.

for the council, Professors Liahna

of the group would be handled. Tederman
said the Joint Board has a free reign in
determining how the guards would be
paid. Initially, the board voted to set up a
committee which would designate
guidelines in determining uiis procedure.
Later, it was decided that Vice President
Mark Bradshaw, Social Coordinator
Allison Paigh and Haines Hall President
Pete Hautzinger would collaborate on a
proposal for choosing and paying guards
that would be subject to Joint Board ap-
proval next week. Tederman and many
Joint Board members are anxious to start
this program because allcampus parties
have already begun,

The SGA proposed 1932443 hudget also
came up for approval during the meeting.
Repraentatives from the Grinnell Review
attended the meeting in hopes of increas-
ing their allocation of funds from $1,000 to
$1,500. Beth Vilen spoke on behalf of the
Review stating that the magazine has eX‘
penses reaching close to $8,000 and less
than one third is covered by subscriptions

Bradshaw suggested that the organizar
tion try to exhaust other avenues of
revenue such as the Rosenfield Program
and the President's Fund before asking for
more money immediately, Vilen and ﬁle
Review budget director pointed out that
even after tapping new sources of income
they would still maintain a deficit in fun
ding, After continued discussion, the ins
crease was voted in 17 to four.

Bradshaw later suggested that the
budget be tabled and returned to commit-
tee for review. SGA is still interviewing
candidates for the finance committee.
Bradshaw and many Joint Board
members felt that the committee should
have a chance to consult on the standing
before more alterations are made,

from the campus since July, when it we
discovered it had been defaced with spray

The untitled work was completed an-

The final discussion of the meeting
centered around a letter written by Read

communication between Joint Board and
the administration. Rudolph focused on
the security guard proposal which was
presented before Joint Board as an exam

SGA channels and making decisions strict»
