Student

ill-advised
in assault
case

by Ellen Heath

while returning to campus fromt a
restaurant in town at about 11 pm. on
Thursday, Sept. 9, a male college student
was assaulted by a teenage Grinnell resi-
dent,

The student said he and four other
students were walking back to their dorm,
and upon reaching the corner of Sixth
Avenue and Park Street, a car drove up
and stopped, forcing them to walk around
it to cross the street. He said someone in
the car yelled out to them and the students
thought they recognized the voice.

The men spoke back to the person in the
car whom they thought they knew, but,
said the student, ”We were mistaken in
who ive thought it was." According to him,
a young male got out oi the car and asked
the students if they wanted to “rumble."
The student said he tried to explain the
mistake but the man who got out at the car
hit him two or three times before he could
finish. The student who Was assaulted
claimed that he and his friends had not
said anything “that would provoke an
assault,"

Aiter being hit, the student and his com-
panlons backed away from the car and
continued on to their dorni The people in
the car yelled at them, said the student.
and drove away.

When the five students reached home
they reported the incident to thcir resident
advisor who informed them of other com-
plaints about the same car that evening.
The student said he then “agreed to call
the police.“

Aiter ten to is minutes the police came
to the R A.’s apartment and said they were
holding suspects for the assault at the
police station. The five students then went
to the police station to identity the
suspects.

They identified the car parked outSlde
the station and then, according to the slur
dent who was assaulted, the police officer
“just paraded us past them and said ‘Did
you see them?’ "Thesuspects were seated
in one room through which the students
passed on their way to another room where
they talked with police officers. In a later
conversation .lames Tederman, dean oi
student allairs, said the door between the
two rooms was not even closed when the
students were asked to identify the
suspects.

Alter identiiying the youths, the students
were told by a police oiiicer that since the
offender was a juvenile there was nothing
the students or police could do about the
assault. The olficcr also said the youth was
leaving the state the next day, and said the
student. “He ended up advising us not to do
anything."

Tederman was informed of the incident
and Spoke to Chief of Police Bill Peters
about it. Tederman said he Was upset with
the way the identification procedure was
handled and with the advice the students
were given. peters agreed with Tederman
and said he would "take appropriate ac-
tion with the ollicer" in question, accor-
ding to the dean.

Tederman said he commends the police
for taking such quick action in the matter
and encourages students who are
assaulted or harrassed to report it to the
police immediately. in such cases, Teders
man said, “People really ought to press
charges." The dean stated that the Student
Affairs Office will help students with court
cases and has done so before

When incidents of harrassment or
assault occur on campus the names of the
offenders are added to a list of people who
are not allowed on campus. This list is
posted in places such as the cage in the
Physical Education Complex which is used
by many townspeople People whose
names are on the list receive a warning
that ii they are caught on campus they will
be charged with criminal trespassing.

London program adds science curriculum

by Daniel Nissenbaum

The prospectus for the Fall '33 Grinnell-
in-London program is a departure irom
previous programs. For the iirst time
since its inception in 1974, the London pro
gram will include science courses taught
by Williston Professor of Physics Beryl
Clotfelter. The other Grinnell represen-
tatives will be American Studies and
English Assistant Professor Liahna
Babener, This combination offers a break
from the traditional social studies-
humanities course oilerings.

As usual, the semester is divided into
two sessions; the first nine week phase IS
comprised of three [our credit courses.
and the remaining four weeks focus on one
iour credit topic. Mr. Cloti‘elter's physics
course during Phase One is “An Historical
Approach" iollowed by the Phase Two
course “Megalithic Monuments and the
Sky of Neolithic Britain." Ms ltabener
will teach the course entitled “Madonnas
and Magdelens: Victorian Women in Art
and Literature," to be followed by the
Phase Two course “Nightscapes: The
World of the English Mystery.” Clotfelter
explained that science majors cannot
receive requirement credit because the
courses are special topics, but at least
“Science majors might find the history of
technology interesting.”

The technology course is a new develop
merit, a team»taught course entitled
"British Technology: Historical Develop
merit and Artistic Response " Babener ex

plained that she and Clotielter designed
this class to study “a series of salient
developments in technology and the
response of artists and writers oi the
time." Clotielter will include a historical
treatment oi the coal mining industry in
Britain supplemented by Babener's ex»
amination or a relevant DH, Lawrence
novel. Another section will look at the Lon-
don iactories through the reading oi
Charles Dickens novel, Hard Times.

The opportunity to see the museums and
sights or London and Great Britain will
add an extra dimension to the courses
Numerous tield trips and site visits will
compliment the course syllabi during both
phases Clotlelter mentioned several
museum trips which would supplant the
usual demonstration equipment in the
classroom. Ther, will be exhibits oi the
work oi several prominent British
physicists, such as Newton and Faraday,
in addition to a Greenwich display oi the
development oi the chronometer The
Phase Two course, “Megalithic
Monuments," will consider the almost 900
megalithic circles in Great Britain irom
an astronomer's viewpomt.

In her clases, Babener will rely on the
numerous art museums in London and the
historically preserved homes oi such
authors as Jane Austin, John Keats and
virginia Wooli, In additon, students will go
on an obligatory visit to Sherlock Holmes'
Baker Street for the mystery course.

Through these visits, Babener explained
that she will use the setting in literature to
examine “the cultural institutions and
Values of bonded" On a more general
level, she will discuss how the British View
themselves and the Americans.

Aside from the addition of the science
course, Doug Caulkins, director of oil‘-
campus studies, stressed another new
development in the Grinnell-in-London
program. “We are now firmly committed
to offering places to sophomores," he ex
plained, There are iewer course prere
quisites to facilitate this addition. The
decision was made for several reasons. in
cluding the hope that this change will in
crease the number of students in the
group. Also, by giving students an oppor»
tunity to visit London belore committing
themselves to a major, Caulkins feels that
the program could provide a “foundation
of experience and knowledge." Both
aspects, the science offerings and the in-
clusion oi sophomores, were incorporated
“to make certain to keep faith with the
liberal arts tradition.” Caulkins conclud-
ed.

Program inlormation will be published
in the Memo and the still; One recruiting
meeting is planned ior early October lor
sophomores and juniors and another in the
spring ior treshman. Students may contact
Mr, Caulkins for more information concer-
ning requirements and applications.

Alumni/college relations improve

by Viki Broderick
According to Shane Bellis Cook. new

director oi alumni ailairs, “No one is as
enthusastic about working with the college
as lam," When questioned about her new
responsibilities as a representative oi
Grinnell College, she expressed a concern
about adverse publicity. although she add-
ed, "We don‘t get much oi it."

As director, Cook will act as a
spokesperson on behali oi the college at
various alumni gatherings in different
parts of the country throughout the year
She is also in charge of the Alumni Pro-
grams Office which coordinates events
such as Parents~ Weekend aiid serves as
headquarters to the Alumni Association.
over which Roger Zimmerman currently
presides.

Zimmerman explained that the Alumni
Association iunctions primarily as a
bridge between the college and alumni.
This is accomplished through lettcrs sent
to class agents who are Grinnell graduates
representing their class body.
and through The Grinnell Magazine. The
class agents then have the option or con
tactlng their former classmates in order to
relate information concerning college ac
tivities. The Grinnell Magazine. howeVei‘i
is sent directly to all traceable Grinnell

graduates.

Zimmerman also believes the Alumni
Association aids in establishing rapport
between the student body and the alumni
through its work with Career Services. in
this way, a student interested in pursuing a
certain career may go to the Career Ser-
vices otiice and request an interview or
even in internship with a professional in
that iield. Career Services will then con-
tact the Alumni Programs Office, which in
turn attempts to locate an alumnus
employed in that occupation who is willing
to work with the student,
