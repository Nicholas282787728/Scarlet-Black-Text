Hospice aides in understanding death

by Marty Meriotto
Frencn Historian Phillipe Aries recently

noted that our youth-oriented society has
tried to deny both our mortality and the
concept oi death, and in the process we
have abused those who most remind us oi
our mortality, the terminally ill. it is this
perceived ”dehumanization” or death that
Hospice Grinnell hopes to reverse. Toward

this end, Hospice Grinnell will try both to.

improve the current,l_1are'~that the'dying
are receiving and to educate society on
what they ieel is the need ior a greater
understanding oi the problems of dying.

These goals led to the founding of the
modern hospice program. The iirst
hospice began 155 than 15 years ago in
Great Brimin, and was founded by the St.
Christopher‘s Roman Catholic Order, This
model hospice encouraged iamilies to par-
ticipate in a loved one’s death and
Leﬂfuited clinical workers to work with
and become friends with the terminally ill.
They also attempted to provide iamiliar
surroundings in which the patient could be
most comfortable in his final days. This
model tirst became operational in the
United States in the mid-19705 The
Hospice Grinnell chapter came into or
istence in March, 1901, adopting the St.
Christopher's model.

in many respects, hospice represents a
new and revolutionary way oi treating the
dying But as Mary Lou clottelter, a ioun-
ding hospice board member and wiie oi
Physics Proiessor Beryl clotielter, ex-
plained, “Hospice wants to restore the
values that were lost 50 years ago. . . a
situation in which a dying person’s iamily
and friends could express their love and
care. . . Today's medicalization of death
and society’s attitudes toward death in
general has made such love and care a
crime,” said Clotfelter.

, These thoughts were shared by Dorothy
Palmer, the first chairperson of Grinnell
Hospice and an alumna oi Grinnell College
(class of '62). Palmer hopes that the
clinicalworkers might be able to help both

' imately three months, involved “totally

nell. All aspects of die dining area have
been upgraded, from the floor tile to the
lighting system to new china and plants.

the dying and their families face the
realities of death. “Clinical workers can
not only help the dying but can also help
the patient’s family in the care of the tern
minally ill and adjusting to his or her
death."

Hospice clinical volunteers go through a
trainmg program Since the hospice ideal
revolves around “symptom control," tak»
ing whatever measures necessary —
whether pharmacologic, psychologic or
spiritual ~ to keep the patient at his or her,
optimal level or iunctioning, there is no set
procedure oi training. instead each
volunteer is introduced to basic hospital
procedures and is given the option of tak-
ing care oi the patient as he or she feels iit.

Among those in attendance at the Aug.
31 meeting were members of the Grinnell
iaculty and student body. Many oi them
had conflicting reasons about why they
became interested in Hospice

Sandy Moiiett, proiessor or theater, is a
board member of the hospice. He express-
ed philosophical reasons why he became
interested in joining hospice “We have a

"terrible way or dealing with death. . . we
need to face death and find out what

'death’s about," said Moffett. “We would
have a much healthier society if we could
face our own mortality.” Moffett [eels that
the denial of death can lead to two ex-
tremes, one extreme being a tear that
makes society treat the dying as modern
day lepers, the other extreme being a
disregard of death that can make human
hie meaningless and acts such as wars and
murders commonplace.

Mary Barton '83, has more personal
reasons as to why she attended the
meeting. Because her mother belonged to
a hospice program in her native wiscon-
sin, Mary was encouraged to witness and
participate in etiorts to comfort her dying
grandiather. ”It was this experience that
made me appreciative oi the hospice pro-
gram,” she explained.

the change was that. “The dining room
had a very institutional look " He con»
tinued, “It was time to do it. We hadn’t
slated major renovations ior another year
or so, but the project was accelerated by
the school's interest in doing summer cone
ierences on campus”

The installation of the Conveyor belt is
the major improvement, according to Me-
Connell. 1n the past, students were respon-
sible for taking their trays into the kitchen
sink area to the tray breakdown center.
Over the summer, one doorway was closed
and a second modified in order to set up
the tray conveyor, McConnell reels the
new system is working well. “The biggest
problem is in the stacking or the trays.
Students just need to be a little bit patient
during the peak times of returning
dishes,” emphasized McConnell.

Other improvements include the pur»
chasing of new tables and chairs, new tile
ior the floor, a beverage counter.
modification oi the lighting system, pur-
chase of new china, the addition of new
banners and live plants, and a paint job,

The overall cost exceeded $100,000. Ac-
cording w McConnell, the furniture cost
$51,000; the conveyor belt was $30,000; the
floor tile was around $7,000: the beverage
counter was $0,000; the lighting system
was $20,000; the china was $12,000; and the
banners, plants and planters cost around
39,000.

The tables seal irom two to eight people
The new beverage counter, McConnell
said, makes operations run more smoothly
and relieves the congestion in this area,
McConnell also noted that the lighting
system is vastly improved. He explained
that dimmers have been added to make
the atmosphere more pleasant when it
starts to get dark earlier. “The lighting is
improved because there just wasn’t
enough power wattage before to get eileo
tive lighting," stated McConnell The new
banners were put up ior several reasons 7

John Gazewood ’83, became interested
as a result of his work as a hospital order-
ly. “While the hospital I worked in gave
superior gedical care to the terminally
ill," replied John, “a regular hospital, no
matter how good it is, tends to take away
irom a person‘s seii dignity." As a pre-
medical student, Gazewood hopes to use
any experiences gained at the hospice to
provide a better climate, both medically
and psychologically, ior the dying.

Peg Van Valen '83, became interested in
Hospice Grinnell as an opportunity to care
for and work with other people. While she
does not plan a career in medicine, she
tools that the training at hospice can be ap-
plied to a variety oi social work and proiesr
sions, She feels, “Caring is something
which is sometimes missing both on and
off campus. This program might be one
way in which it might be restored, even if
only in a slight way."

Dorothy Palmer explained that very iew
students, if any, will become Clinical
workers, due to the fact that their
academic responsibilities will not allow
them enough time. Nevertheless both
Palmer and Clotfelter hoped that students
can become assistants to clinical workers
and office volunteers. Both were pleased
by the number of students who attended
last week's meeting.

When asked what was the ultimate ob-
jective or the Hospice Grinnell, almost all
the board members pointed to a speech
given at the Aug. 12 meeting by the Rev.
Philip Ramstad of me United Church of
Christ,’ also a board member. Rev.
Ramstad said, “Death must simply
become the discreet but dignified exit of a
peaceful person irom a helpiul society that
is not torn by a biological transition
without pain, surten'ng. . and ultimately
without fear. . . and that is the goal of Grins
neil Hospice. , .

they “add color, bafﬂe sound and have the
effect of lowering the ceiling," McConnell
explained,

The purchase oi new china and live
green plants might seem estravagant to
some. However, McConnell is “committed

to the idea that if students start with .

something nice, they will keep it nice." He
noted that there will also be new banners.
The plants were not put in earlier because
the renovations were just being completed
before New Student Days, and “We didn’t
see it possible to get them in and planted
right away." said McConnell. As far as the
types oi plants go, a local ilorist is working
on the job based on lighting levels and the
heartiness of the plants.

Another addition which McConnell
would like to see by ﬁle end of the semester
is the installation of artwork, probably
catalog prints, on the walls oi the dining
room.

Regarding remodeling plans tor Quad
Dining Room on South Campus, McConnell
explained, “The Quad, because oi its very
nature, does not lend itsell to the type or
refurbishings done in Cowles ” He added,
“We're going to look at what can be done "
immediate plans tor the dining room in-
clude the purchase oi new chairs and
medieval banners and figuring out a way
to improve the tray breakdown area.

The physical aspects oi the dining room
are not the only areas or change, Accor-
ding to McConnell, “We just finished
rewriting the menu this summer." The
staff will evaluate the popularity oi the
meals and ”tune it up each time based on
student reactions," There also seems to be
a good response to the vegetarian pro-
gram. as McConnell noted

The overall response. according to Me
Connell, has been positive. He commented.
”We have gone to great time and expense
in trying to make Cowles an appealing
place to dine, and we would hope that
students respect that aspect."
