Buffer clays proposal . reiected

Faculty to discuss alternatives

by Jeff Raymond

Despite the efforts of an unofficial stu-
dent organization to institute more buffer
days for next year, Grinnell College
students will be forced to find other ways
to cope with mounting academic pressure
at least until me calendar is reworked for
the mobs academic year.

The goal of the committee, as stated in a
letter to the editor in the October 15 issue
of the 8&8, was the Implementation of one
buffer day to both the fall and spring
semesters of the 1983-84 academic year.
The proposal was presented to the Calen-
dar Committee in its final form November
8 by the Committee for Buffer Days: Jane
Brown, Jim Rabchuk, Dan Nissenbaum
and Gautam Ghosh.

Dean Catherine Frazer, who sits on the
Calendar Committee, said that the com~
mittee decided not to take any immediate
action on the proposal. This in efiect stiiled
the proposal. She said that the calendar for
next year was already in place, and it was
made in accordance with a survey of facul-
ty members. Calendar scheduling in-
cluding a starting date for school in the
fall, a five»week semester break, a Mon-'
day graduation and a Friday off after
Thanksgiving was taken into account by
the study, .

AS the semester draws closer to exam
week, the staff of Burling Library has had
to establish a new rule concerning use of
the Carrels to handle the recent rush of
students.

“We hate to be rigid with rules, but we
simply do not have enough carrel space
yet,” explained Librarian Anne Kintner.

Due to the lack of furniture, which Con-
tributes to a shortage of study space, the
library staff has not yet assigned Carrels,
Now, as stated in a recently released
memo to the campus, students will no
longer be able to leave meir books in a Car-
rel to reserve their spot‘ until they come
back. .

“We hope the students understand. Dur-
ing the renovation process the building
sometimes demands changes, and we have
to do the best we can to make accommoda-
tions,” stated Kintner,

According to library workers, as the
number of students using the library in
creased, more and more students began to
complain about getting to the library only
to find another student's books occupying
an odrerwise empty carrel.

“It use to be you had to get here at 7
o‘clock just to iind an empty study space,”
explained Kevin Rhodes.

So far the library staff has not been over-
come with students upset with the new
rulesKintner pointed out, “Most students
have been raﬂ'ier nice about the whole
thing. Many times Students enter the
library and forget that a lot of things in the
building are Still incomplete, such as ex
posed wiring."

No one knows for sure just when the
needed furniture will arrive. ”It is just as
much a surprise for us as it is for the
students," explained Mrs. Kintner.

On the order list of items yet to come are
lockers that will be available for students
to store their books. It is hoped that the
lockers will arrive in the next couple of
weeks and with them better study facilities

 

for students.

carried out as had been planned by Frazer

‘and Ray Obermlller, the director of

academic advising. Further, Rabchuk
claimed that the calendar was drawn up
ior the convenience oi the Calendar Com-
mittee, and that it ignored the possibility
or having more than just the weekend for
buifer days prior to finals.

Frazer felt that the broader issue oi
academic pressure was what should have
been addressed. she said that there should

,be more control of academic pressure

from the outset, and that the buffer days
proposal was a short-term measure that
would not alleviate the more fundamental
problem.

“The proposal was proposing to stick a
band-aid on the problem," commented
Frazer. She added, “You can‘t piecemeal
it.” ,
Rabchuk complained that, ”We were led
to believe that a short-term measure was
possible," although he did not elaborate.
He also felt that the problem of immediate
academic pressure was pressing enough to
revise the calendar for next year.

The issue of academic pressure'has been
placed on the agenda for this Monday's
faculty meeting for discussion. Frazer

. said that ideas on the severity of the issue

and Ways to alleviate it would be called for

at meeting

at that time. However, due to the timing oi
the meeting and the need for next year's
course syllabi to be drawn up, it is too late
for anyuung to be done until the rail
semester next year.

Rabchuk is upset about what he feels is
the lack of action, He expressed frustrar
tion at nothaving any swiiter action by the
Calendar Committee. “We got stonewalled
to some extent,” he said,

Frazer has already proposed several
measures that might be Considered to
lighten the academic pressure on students.
She mentioned a “dead week” right before
exams during which no major
assignments could be due. having a
percentage of the grade figured much
earlier in the semester. and deemphasiz-
ing the weight of the final, She also pointed
out that, “Buffer days have more often
than not numbered two."

The Committee for Buffer Days may
now work with Frazer to pass her ideas to
the faculty and have them adopted. Rab»
chuk, though, sees a problem in this
because he feels that Frazer‘s proposals
will change the way courses are taught as
opposed to when they end.

As for faculty reaction to the existing
pressure on students, Frazer said, “We
worry about it. We try not to aggravate it,”

Encouraged by their efforts to recover
stolen KDIC albums, Station Manager
Chris Ertel and Music Director Chris
Fousek confronted another student. and
this time regained seven albums.

The latest recovery brings the total to
three separate busts netting 14 stolen
albums, “It would be great if we could
recover more than was stolen this
Semester," said Ertel, He estimated the
number of albums stolen since September
to be 20 to 25 albums. '

Ertel and Fousek will continue to follow
leads concerning stolen albums, but to
follow up on their last warning, a new
“Theft Policy" will go into effect on
December 10. Any albums returned before
that date will be accepted without ques-
tions, and the KDIC representatives en-
courage individuals with stolen albums to
take advantage of this opportunity.

Exodus of S.A.s at break forcessearch

by Terri Porter

The high turnover rate of student ad~
visers, particularly at semester break, is a
continuing concern within the SA pro
gram. According to Assistant Dean of Stun
dent Affairs Flossie Mitchell, ﬂiis rate is
very high, fewer than 20 percent oi a total
of 56 5A5 reapply irom year to year.

Alﬂwugh a turnover is expected every
year, no SAs are expected to leave at any
semester break, However, as Mitchell
noted, there have been some problems,
both last year and this year, with the
semester turnover rate, Because it is a
year long position, those people who know
they will not be on campus second
semester should not apply. The problems
in turnover at the semester result from
people changing their minds about leaving
or people being put on academic proba»
‘tion. —

“Another thing that happens,” accor-
ding tc Mitchell, “is that some people don’t
end up being very good SAs, In this case,
we have 3 RA work with the SA to try and
improve problems." Mitchell conceded
that these efforts do not always work and
therefore contribute to the turnover rate at
the end of first semester.

As far as future concerns about the high
turnover rate, Mitchell commented, “I
would like to see less turnover, and par
ticularly during the year because I think
we need the continuity on the floor
throughout the year." She added, “In

terms of turnover from one year to me
next, we encourage all SAs to think about
reapplying.”

Despite the high turnover rate, Mitchell
remarked, “I basically ieel very good
about the program,” She continued by say-
ing, ”There are always ways things can be

, improved, but we’re starting from a solid
base."

In order to assess student reactions to
the program, a subcommittee oi the Com-
mittee on Student Life was set up. Their
task is to review the SA position and make
recommendations to the CSL based on
their findings.

This subcommittee recently took a ran-
dom survey oi 200 students and had a 65
percent questionnaire return rate. Mit-
chell, who is also the chairperson of the
subcommittee, stated, “These surveys
showed that the underlying premise was
that it's a good, worthwhile program,” She
noted that the committee is reviewing stun
dent comments on the surveys and will be
looking at them as a basis for improve
ment.

At the present time, it is too early to tell
whether there will be any changes made In
the program. Mitchell said, “It’s possible
here will be some changes. if there are, i
don't expect them to he sweeping
changes." She further commented that the
basic program would remain intact and
provide a base around which im-

provements would be centered.

The position of student adviser is a
somewhat unique aspect of Grinnell Col-
lege, The role gives those sophomores,
juniors or seniors who are qualified an op-
portunity to secure more responsibility
and gain experience in listening, advising
and leadership. and in learning different
ways in whichTo deal with fellow students.

The responsibilities of an SA, according
to Mitchell, involve acting as a peer
counselor and a resource person as well as
orienting new students and promoting uni-
ty on the floor. Mitchell stated, “The SA
plays an important role in making the
dorm more than just a place to sleep."

Because the SA is an important element
in everyday student life, persons who app-
ly for the position need to meet certain
Criteria. The two minimal requirements
are that an applicant he a sophomore,
junior or senior and not be on academic
probation. Beyond this, it is the selection
committee‘s job to interview people and
try to determine which students are best
suited for the position,

There will be information sessions
within the first week or two after break for
prospective SAs next year. Students in
terested in such a position should attend
one of these meetings which will attempt
to provide answers to questions or con,
cerns that students may have.
