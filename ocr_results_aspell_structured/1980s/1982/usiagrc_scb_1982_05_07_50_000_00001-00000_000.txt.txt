The South Africa Support Group tries again
“We really hope they’ll divest this time”

by Michael Alexander‘
DIVEST NOW! .

These days it seems impossible to get
through a whole day at Grinnell without
seeing or hearing that infamous phrase
somewhere. But what does it mean? Read
on, pilgrim ,

The issue o corporate responsibility is
not new at Grinnell College, The first
record of interest in the cause goes back to
1973 when four students went before the
Board of Trustees with a resolution calling
for a policy of investor responsibility. The
resolution was adopted without any major
struggle. and was hailed by the 5&3 with
optimism: “. . . in the area of public
responsibility, Grinnell can be proud that
it stands unified in favor of action to fur-
ther the best interests of the society
around us,"

Nine years have passed since then, and
that optimism has been replaced with a
feeling of frustration on the part or many
students. it was in this atmosphere that
the South Africa Support Group was form-
ed.

It all started in the fall of 1980, when exil-
ed South African journalist Dumisani
Kumalo came to give a convocation
speech. Some students were extremely in-
terested in what he had to say. but it took
them a while to get organized and form a
group. 7

They then discovered, in the beginning
of the second semester, that the Board of
Trustees was about to hold an open forum.
About one week before it occured. they
formed a group on the spur oi the moment.
The group distributed a petition in three
days and collected almost 500 signatures,
At the forum, about 20 of the students stood
up and read to the trustees a statement
detailing the petition, and requesting
divestment.

The trustees agreed to meet with them to
talk about it the following day. “At this
point we really hadn't put in a lototwork,"
said Joe] Robbins, member of SASG “We
knew what was wrong with South Africa
and why we Wanted divestment. but we
hadn't evei‘ thought that there were
arguments on the other side, We just
hadn‘t worked things out, They told us a lot
of their reservations. and agreed to have a
formal talk with the Board at their next
meeting,"

Before that meeting. the group cirr
culated a new petition and set up South
Africa information tables at the post office
and the dining halls. They also began to do
a lot of research in an attempt to solidify
their arguments. This research Tor.

mulated die foundation of a pamphlet
which they published shortly before they
met widi die trustees {or a second time, on
May 1 ot last year.

“We gave an hourrlong presentation,"
Robbins said. “They listened politely, but
finally said that they hadn't studied the
situation enough in a year and a half. his
tellectually, that's where it's ended,

“I suppose their arguments are on
several levels, but basically they say that
the college divesting would do nothing to
affect the situation down there, and also it
would represent Grinnell College ‘washing
its hands.’ Well, the most basic argument
you can make about this is. if your hands
are di'rty, wash them, We're doing nothing
now, we've never voted on proxy resolue
tions positively. . ,we've never voted ‘yes'
on any move to change things; we've
never taken any initiative And the Board
just doesn't have any time, they're here
just three days a year. So essentially,
they're guilty right now.

“Gr‘lnnell's divesting stands a chance of
doing something. it will get publicity, and
it can help other colleges to divest, i.e. the
domino eilect. Also, it is encouraging
news, and they would find out about it in
South Africa, and that helps. There are all
kinds of bodies. like'the American Come
mittee on Africa, that are set up to
publicize these things. And if Grinnell imr
agines itself to be a moral leader, a little
bit above the rest and such a fine institu-
tion, then it might as well think
that its lead is worth something,

”One big thing about past groups like
ours is that they come and go. People
graduate. Which is one of the reasons, I
think, that the trustees love to take so
much time. They figures we‘ll graduate
and the thing will just die out. It's like
anything else at the college — it comes in
waves What they don't know is that} this
group is pretty well organized and has peo-
ple of different class years in it. and
hopefully we won't peter out if they don't
do what we want. We'll keep the pressure
on,"

One breakthrough for the group occured
at Wednesday's Joint Board meeting
SASG proposed that SGA adopt the resolu-
tion that A) No student government funds
be invested in corporations operating in
South Africa, and B) That Grinnell College
should divest its endowment of all stocks
held in corporations operating in South
Africa,

After some debate among members, in-
cluding David Molho and Harley Liker
who argued against the
adoption of the proposal, there was an in

“... no matter how intimidating it might be
to be told you’re wrong by a bunch of

millionaires, they can’t just keep exercising
their power. They can’t stand up there and

bullshit again. ”

itial vote: 8-7, against. Amidst a chorus of
groans. Jeff Schmidt slowly raised his
hand. “I wasn't called on to vote," he said.
”And I vote..,yes,” That t|ed the vote and
the decision rested with SGA President
Doug Rowe, All eyes were on him as he
looked down, then slowly raise his head,
smiled, and said one word: ‘yes." The
room was filled with sighs and cheers and
Rowe kiddingly remarked, “That's pro-
bably the most important thing I‘ve done
all year.”

Apparently, the Board or Trustees will
not be swayed as easily. According to
several sass members, the group has
been sending them intormation about the
situation since their first meeting with
them, Yet the trustees still claim that mey
aren't sufficiently familiar with the issue.
For this reason, members of SASG cringe
over occasions such as last fall when the
group tried to show trustees a slide show of
South Africa, and they asked in die middle
of it not to see the rest,

Larry liecimovich. member oi the sup
port .group. elaborated on the issue;
“We've given them a lot of information
beforehand; when we went to meet with
these people m this was a special commit-
tee that had been appointed four months
belore — they hadn't read anything we'd
sent them, they had no idea of the issues or
anything. So they were saying, OK, let's
start from zero and eventually maybe
we'll be able to talk intelligently with you,
but We aren't now. So that meant that It
would be another four months before we
could get anywhere again, and that's this
opportunity."

Robbins echoed Hecimovich's sen-
timents Hesaid. “They've now had a lot of
information sent to them, and if they don't
know the issues, then it's basrcally their
fault. There's no more we could have done,
And it is their responsibility to point up
their side. They can‘t expect us to go out
and get their side for them."

He continued, “There are about _two

“Also,” he continued. "we know that

the ‘big money men‘ on the board aren't
doing a good job supporting their position.
I can't see these other trustees just being

Today at no pm. a group of live
students from the group are going to meet
with the trustees. A rally, which will be
taking place outside of Grinnell House, will
be going on during the discussion Food

Magurshak and Gulrira will be speaking.

“We really hope they'll divest this
time," concluded Robbins. “I think they
might, because there are a lot of students
and faculty behind it, and i think that they
really haven't done the work to uphold
their position amidst our coherent and
well-formulated opposition. if we lose
