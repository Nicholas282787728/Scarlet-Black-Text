o the Editor:
Congratulations to all the 200 people who

defense ol the trustees decision to stick

Mr, Maytag should open the college
Catalog and see that this college has a non
iscrimination policy, and that page seven
espouses "social responsibility," Apare
eid is "an oiiicial policy oi racial
segregation promulgated in the Republic
of South Afric " as the dictionary defines
it, In bare, gut-wrenching terms it means
the starvation and exploitation of blacks
y a white minority. Yet Maytag was
quoted as saying divestment would be a
‘cop out.” That doesn't sound very social-
ly responsible. The nondiscrimination
policy takes on a diiierent meaning while

Some obvious remarks

Last week, 1 promised 1 would write
something satirical about the comprehen-
sive iee increase. Well, let me put it this
way, it was hard. 1 really could think oi
practically nothing to say.

Go ahead, you try to think or something.
Not so easy, is it?

on sure, the obvious popped into my
head. like:

ismsasss$3533msssssssssssssssswsswss
Hey, what are you worried about? So the
comprehensive lee went up $995. Big deal.
We'll all still be able to come here. The coir
lege will surely raise iinancial aid A[ter
all, Grinnell is a nonprofit organization
that wants us tor our minds, not our
money.

To the Editor.

1 have recently received a letter irom
Gary Doernhoeler, 1979 class iund direc-
tor, regarding SGA's Activities Endow-
ment Fund.

Although i agree with the philosophy oi
the program, 1 am quite disenchanted with
SGA's concept ior iunding it. This letter.
then, is an attempt to evaluate the problem
or iunding such a program and to oiier
what i believe to be a more workable solu-
tion.

simply stated, today's students llike
ourselves) are not prepared to sacriiice
present social activ es for the benefit of
iuture classes, Rather, you are asking us
to iund a program that will beneiit tomor-
row‘s classes without aiiecting your abili-
ty to offer current activities. The solution I
would offer emphasizes the shared con-
cern of past as well as today's students to
oiier high-quality. cost-eiiicient programs
lor iuiure generations while minimizing
sacriiices to your present social activities
calendar,

it is basically a matching iund system. li
SGA will match dollar-ior-dollar contribu»
tions of the past three classes up to $5,000,
we will be able to meet your present pro-
jection of $10,000. 1 will personally match
iive percent oi SGA's contribution up to
35,000, If we [allow this approach, your
Sacrilices will be limited and past Classes
would, I believe, be more inclined to can
tribute to such a worthy project. I would
also suggest that an oversight board com»
prised of past and present students be ap-
pointed to monitor such a program. — best
regards, Cornell K, Rudov, '79

Norrisite complains

Two weeks ago. Norris Hall residents
were called together tor a meeting to go
over the recent heavy lines that were in-
curred against the hall iunds. A couch and
several chairs from the iourth iloor
lounge and two tire extinguishers irom
other doors were damaged or stolen and
the money to pay to replace these items
was taken train the hall iunds. leaving the
dorm with only a few dollars tor the rest at
the year Obviously. not all at the hall
residents were responsible ior what hap
pened but they all will suiier the conse-
quences oi the actions of a iew.

0i course, I am upset about having to
share the punishment for the actions or
others but what was most upsetting about
the whole allair was the Iloor meeting to
decide "what to do.“ After being "politely
invited" to the meeting. I had to sit
through redundant statements about the
nature of the situation. However, I was
well aware of the situation and it was a
waste of time to drill the "gravity of the
Situation" into my head, it was the people
who are responsible (or the situation that
need that drilling and they obviously are
impervious to anything that has been or
will be said. So why bother taking the time
to say anyting at all"

The most inluriating episode was when
Kino Ruth, the No RA, brought up the
issue oi "respect He told us that the
lourth iloor residents have no respect tor
the lounge iand 1 use the term lounge
looselyi nor respect tor the dorm
altogether We were then scolded again ior
how noisy,we are. Noise had nothing to do
with the issue at hand But as long as were
were all together. who not use all the amr
munition available against us'.‘

Respect? There are so many things
wrong with this dorm. how can 1 possible
have any respect"! lt's ugly, it's iar away
irom everything, it's claustrophobic and
oven the phone booths are cramped. How
diiiicult would it have been to put a win»
dow in the phone booth door? 1 get

nauseated walking down the hall It used to
be a place to socialize at acceptable hours
but now 1 cannot sit down in the hall
without having to bend my knees and 1
never have visitors. Alter all. who wants to
go all the way to Norris loui'th‘.’ And when
the journey |S so long and the weather is so
cold. 1 too am reluctant to pay visits to
others It saddens me that these situa-
tional iactors should play such a large role
in my diminished social liie

There is more. The heating system is
completely haywire. the rooms are iden
tical and don‘t allow ior unique ai»
rangcments Inconvenience forces me to

' spend most oi the my time in Norris and

most meals at Cowles and now I hear a
rumor at a iiith iloor This impersonal
Holiday Innis clearly the most unpopular
dorm on campus, why put more people
there? Are we not supposed to be ac
comodated as comrortably and come
niently as possible’! 1 recognize the an:
iiculties oi assigning rooms. but when our
adjustment and settling in at Grinnell. our
temporary home, is completely disregaid
ed then our opportunity and potential to
make our Grinnell experience a good one
is destroyed

lam not exonerating the actions (ii a few
on Norris iourih. it would be ideal ii the
people responsible were to actually take
that responsibility and pay up. But I can
see and feel‘the desire to burn, tear, break.
smash. crush and destroy my unpleasant
environment I must admit that I feel no
personal loss, no hurt pride at the destruc-
tion oi the iurniture it is worthless and
even more, it is part or and thereiorc

Don't tell me to have respect and don't
scold me ior not having any. Put Norris

it a respectable and enjoyable place to live
and 1 promise that 1 will have respect
when it is called ior, But in this situation. it
just doesn‘t apply.
