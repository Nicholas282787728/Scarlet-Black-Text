rustees to visit classes

Comrriittee hopes .to improve
trustee relations with campus

by Bob Joell

The Trustee-Faculty Relations Commit
tee was founded to act as a liaison between
the campus community and the Board of
Trustees. The Relations Committee is a
subcommittee of the Board of Trustees
and consists of members of the faculty
selected by the president of theeollege,
The committee is expected to inform the
board on matters that range from faculty
appointments to management of the en
dowment.

Typically. before the board arrives on
campus the faculty is solicited for ideas or
issues which should be brought to the at
tention of the trustees, The Relations Coma
mittee then meets with the trustees over
lunch and discusses issues which may or
may not be set down on the agenda.
Another method by which the faculty may
approach the trustees is through the chair
man of the faculty, currently Morris
Parslow, professor or French.

When the board arrives on campus this

spring for their semi-annual meeting.
members will find alterations in the usual
agenda. Changes have been made in order
to give the trustees more access to faculty
and students and more insight into student
life, The Relations Committee feels that
the Board of Trustees does not come in
close enough contact with the students and
faculty.

The Board will get the opportunity to do
two things intended to improve their
visibility on campus, thus serving to
enhance student-Board relations. First, in
place of the meeting normally held, the
group will be given the chance to visit
classes which meet at 11 a m. on the Frir
day of their visit. Afterwards the board
will be offered the chance to eat lunch in
either of the dining halls. These changes
were made to improve present relations
that exist between the Board of Trustees
and the campus community.

Competition grows over
local FM frequency

Couple learned of Grinnell through

Newsweek article

by Steven W. Way

A local FM radio frequency apparently
overlooked when the majority of today’s
radio signals were assigned over 30 years
ago has become a point of contention bet
ween a Grinnell businessman and a young,
entrepreneurial Minnesota couple. They
are both vying before the Federal Come
munications Commission for broadcast
rights to the frequency.

Pamela White, who runs a class “A” FM
station along with her huband John in Sprr
ing Grove, Minn. filed in October. 1981, to
start a 3,000 wattstation to be the first full-
time Grinnell venture of its kind, The cola
lege FM station, KDIC, is not considered a
full-time station due to its low wattage and
failure to broadcast throughout the year.

Three months after their proposal was
filed however, Frosty Mitchell made a
similar move before the FCC, proposing
instead to locate his new station in
Brooklyn, Iowa. Mitchell, who runs Grin-
nell's AM station, KGRN, claimed that,
due to the lack of FM stations in many
rural towns around Grinnell, the studios
and transmitter for the new frequency
should be in Brooklyn,

Given the fact that only one potentially
lucrative channel is available and the fact
that Mitchell's Corner between the two
parties has become keen. The decision
hangs in the hands of a massive federal
bureaucracy,

White said she and her husband became
aware of Grinnell by reading a Newsweek
cover story on small towns late last sumr
mer. She said it is surprising that an empr
ty frequency would remain in as relatively
prosperous an area of eastern Iowa.
"After we saw this article, my husband did
a frequency search for himself and found.
that there indeed was a free channel"in
Grinnell,” White said, "We had our
engineers in Milwaukee verify this for us
and then got to work on the tedious ap-
plication procedure."

The Class “A" station that White propos-
ed to establish in Grinnell would serve a
radius oi approximately so miles but she
Said that the format of any new station is
still undertermined. The station that she

helps run in Minnesota, KQYB, specializes .

in “adult-contemporary music."
in late January however, Mitchell

counterproposed to establish a station of
the same frequency in Brooklyn; an action
diat White said was an effort on his part to
prevent any immediate competition. And
she is not optimistic about her chances for
the FCC license. "At this point i feel the
FCC will be assigning the station to
Brooklyn, primarily because the agency is
concerned about small rural towns that do

' not have a reliable service," White said. ,

"But you never know about the FCC, Con-
sidering that Grinnell has a large popula-
tion, just one daytime AM station and the
low Wattage college station, We could still
have a chance.”

in Mitchell's Counterrproposal to
Washington, he cited a number of deter-
mining factors in aSSlgning the Irequency
that, in White's opinion, were false and
misleading. For example, Mitchell said
that KDIC was planning to convert itself
into a year-round station — a statement
White called “ludicrous” e and he scared
local pilots when he Said that White plann-
ed to build her transmitter very close to
the local airport, 3 statement White Said
she found “very amusing but truthless "

Mitchell, however, said that this state
ment was misunderstood. “I said that, if
the new frequency was not going to in
terfere with stations in Fella, Newton and
Marshalltown, it would have to be located
very close to the Grinnell airport." he said.

As for claiming that KDIC had am»
bitious plans to become a yearlong broad-
caster, Mitchell said the college FM sta-
tion is already considered a full-time sta~
tion due solely to the fact that it does not go
off the air at sunset,

Regardless of charges levied from Side
to side. Mitchell said that even if the FCC
does decide to locate the new frequency in
Brooklyn, White would be able to apply to
run the station and Vice-versa, “! would
hope that for the good oi the area it would
go into Brooklyn and be able to serve Grins
nell as well.” Mitchell said.

White was less optimistic about Mite
chell's intentions. “If he gets the station in
Brooklyn, Grinnell never would have a
fullrtime FM station and he would have
succeeded in doing what he started out to
do [stop competition in Grinnell] "
