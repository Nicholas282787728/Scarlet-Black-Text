AdmissiOns policy no longer “need blind”
Federal cuts and tight budget force change in admission criteria

by Anne Bordonaro

The Grinnell College Admissions and
Financial Aid otiice has made a decision
to institute a limited policy oi admissions
based on the ability to pay, beginning with
the i982 freshmen class, John Hopkins,
director oi Admissions and Financial Aid,
said the college will continue to meet the
needs of any students presently enrolled.
The Board oi Trustees were responsible
tor the decision to limit the budget and the
Admissions onice decided how to imple
ment the budget

The new policy is a move away irom the
“needrbllnd” admissions oi the past
decade to a policy where freshmen may be
admitted but then reiused aid. Because oi
the expected tight budget in the next few
years, an adustment oi iinancial aid
policies was necessary. (Federal loan and
grant funds have already been cut by 23
percent tor the year and cuts or approx
imately 75 percent have been additionally
proposed for 1983 and 1984.) Hopkins said,
”The question is now not whether but how

much federal aid money will be cut."

ln 1981i 85 of the 408 entering freshman
were classified as highrneed students
receiving $7.500 or more in aid. Hopkins
said that in recent years Grinnell has
begun to lose Students from the middle
range of need. He said, “We would like to
be more in balance in terms of numbers of
high-need, middle-need and low need
students, We will not be able to afford as
many highrneed students in the iuture."

There are two ﬁnancial programs at
Grinnell, the general and the minority pres
grams There is no ceiling on the minority
aid budget and Grinnell will continue to
recruit qualitied minority students and to
meet their lull need, Many minority
students are highrneed A cut in minority
aid would reduce minority enrollments,
something the trustees are committed not
to do.

The general aid budget, exclusive of
loans, was $2,300,000 for the 1981-82 and the
trustees have budgeted $2,700,000 for

KDIC auction tomorrow
Wisconsin beer, letters home,
limch cit deli offered

by Kevin L. McKeough

The annual KDIC auction will be held
tomorrow in Darby Gymnasium. Held to
help raise money for the station’s equip-
ment fund, the auction will begin at 3 p.m.

Although ostensibly a KDIC function.
nearly the entire campus and many city
residents have been involved in the auction.
College students, staff and faculty donated
all auction items. The KDIC Staff express
ed hope that many members of the campus
community will attend the auction. Auce
tioneer Dick Sears will return to officiate
the event, as he has in years past,

For this year‘s auction, KDIC staff
members actively recruited donations,
Professors and students, ‘staff members
and student groups have all responded by
donating a wide variety oi items
Economics Professor Peter Bloch has of~
fered a case.of Wisconsin beer, brought
back irom one oi his many trips to that
state. Another professor offered to act as a
consultant in organizing a student writing
assignment. Other items include letters

written home and lunch at Chandelbaum's

‘ Back Alley Deli with 'the Grinneli College

Lunch Club.

The auction will be braodcast live on
KDIC, Broadcasting the auction will pro»
vide students with the opportunity to bid on
items without having to attend the auction
in person, so students can purchase items
in two ways. They can attend the auction
and participate in the bidding there or they
can call the station and submit bids by
phone. The phone numbers will be mention-
ed frequently during the broadcast.

Each year, the proceeds irom the auction
are used to upgrade the station‘s equip-
ment. This year the auction is especially
important. The money raised may be an
important part of the station’s hope of
becoming a loo-watt, stew Operation, In
order to broadcast at that wattage in
stereo, KDIC will need a new transmitter,
mmng board and turntables The money
raised will be an important step towards
the purchase of such equipment.

1982783 to offset tuition increases
However, to provide the same percentage
of aid as last year (taking into account the
increasc in tuition, inrlation and expected
cuts in federal monies) would cost
$3,100,000

The college is committed to maintaining
Sufficient students In order to make up the
“00,000 difference, aid to the 1933
freshmen class must be reduced, It was a
choice between cutting a little irom every
student and maybe losing students or
targetting one level. The decision was
made that medium need i$3,00l)-$7,500 in
aid) and low need 133,000 or less) students
will continue to be admitted without
regard to ability to pay. Most students iali
into these two categories.

The change will come in the higheneed
category where aid will be limited to the so
most qualified students based on board
scores and high school records This will,
in eiiect. become the most competitive

category of admissions because high-need
students will have to meet the general ad-
mission standards and then compete for
the limited number of high-need admis-
sions, Those students who are “marginal
admits" in the general admissions will be
most drastically affected. Hopkins said,
“We will still take the best student first in
any respect."

comparatively, Grinnell will not be hurt
as much as other schools by the federal
cuts, because Grinnell depends on the
iederal government ior only about 25 per
cent of its aid money. Most schools depend
on the tederai government ior as much as‘
sins percent oi their aid budgets. Approx-
imately so percent oi all Grinnell students
and 72 percent of the freshmen are on
some sort of college-funded aid. Many
more also receive federal or state loan and ,
grant money, At Wesleyan and many oi
the prestigious East Coast Schools, only 30
to 40 percent of the students receive aid.

Grinnell graduate arrested during protest-
Layng charged with civil disobedience, possible fine and sentence

by Laura Carter

This Monday at 9 a.m , Kristin Iayng, a
1981 Grinnell graduate, is scheduled to
face the United States of America in
federal magistrate court on a charge or
civil disobedience. She and eight others
[ace charges stemming irom protest in
cidents at the Strategic Air Command,
located on the Offutt Air Force Base, out
side Omaha, Nebraska,

The SAC at Offutt is the headquarters for
the U.S. nuclear weapons operations and
all nuclear strategy is planned inside the
complex. The buttons which can deploy‘
various weapons are seven floors below
ground level. According to Layng, “They
play the war games there.” .

Layng, who was a religious studies ma-
jar and head oi the Campus Democratic
Socialist Organization Committee while at
Grinnell is being prosecuted in conjunction
with a Dec, 28, 1981 incident in which she
and a group of nearly so people tried to
present a statement to the Joint Strategic
Planning Staii The date was picked to
coincide with the Feast of die Holy In-
nocents, an event recognized by Catholics

as the time King Herold killed scores of
children in order to be certain Jesus Christ
would be killed.

About 20 members of the group walked
up the driveway to the base but were stop»
ped by base police. Nine or the protestors
were arrested, including Layng. This was
not the first time she had been arrested by
the base police; however, this was the first
instance in which she Was charged by
federal authorities. She faces a sentence of
up to six months and a fine oi not» if con-
victed.

The same aiternoon, Layng and another
woman tried again to deliver their
message to the Planning Staff. Aiter sear-
ching around the entire base, which is ﬁle
size oi a small city, they tound that they
could climb over part of the barbed wire
surrounding it. After entering the base. the
woman walked to the headquarters
building and delivered a pamphlet to the
desk attendant, who Said he would Send it
to the Planning Staff. Layng and the
woman then called a iriend to pick them up
and ieit, Base authorities now deny uiat

the women could have entered the heavily
gaurded grounds or building.

Layng had also been at the base four
times previously and had been served with
a “ban and bar” letter on two of those oc~
casions. This type of letter notifies the per-
son lmplicated that he is no longer allowed
on iederai property and is just short oi ar-
rest The first time l..ayng received such a
notice was at a base Open House in May,
1581 when she and seven other people had
been given permission to protest outside
the base. After entering the base as
tourists, they attended mass at the chapel
and were then arrested as they ieit the stern
Vice.

The second incident took place Aug. 6,
1981, the anniverary of the American bom-
bing of Hiroshima, Japan This time,
Layng and another woman distributed
leaflets to base workers as they drove past
the end of the driveway. After base police
came to stop them, Layng reported, they
were handcuffed and detained.

Layng‘s reaction to her indictment was

“a momentary twist oi the stomach," she
said. “But I feel no guilt about this, no
remorse.” She believes there are two ways
to explain the purpose oi her actions and
arrest. While she acknowledged that some
people “turn off” to her cause, she
asserted, “If people really start thinking
about'it, they'll realize the nuclear arms
race is insane."

She also stated that her religous beliefs
compel her to protest nuclear arms. “[1]
don't keep from doing something just
because of getting arrested,” she said “A
Christian does What is right and leaves the
results to God."

Besides working for an end to the
nuclear arms race, Layng is also working
ior indigent people through the Catholic
Worker Homes in Des Moines. She became
involved with the service by way oi an inn
ternship she held there in her senior year.
After graduation she continued with the
agency and lived until last October at the
organization’s St, Birgitla's Agri-noniic
University and Communal Farm,
