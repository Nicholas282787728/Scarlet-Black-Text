Americans concerned about nuclear arms race
Pax Christi, federal, state campaigns, Ground Zero

- by Ellen Heath and Laura Carter

Father Jim Gowei‘, a representative Of
Fax Christi. was on campus last week to
talk about the various aspects of nuclear
warfare. Pax Christi is an international
Catholic peace movement.

Founded at theend of World War II in
France to promote reconciliation between
the French and Germans, Pax Christi has
five priority goals. These goals include
disarmament, both nuclear and general;
“a Just world order,” according to the
group’s explanatory pamphlet; support
{or all who, tor reasons oi conscience.
refuse to bear arms; education for peace
and alternatives to violent methods of pro-
blem solving.

Gower has been traveling across the
country since last September, stopping in
a diiierent parish each week to speak
about the Pax Christi objectives. He said
one purpose oi his talks is to raise ques»
tions about what Americans can do,
besides warfare, to settle international
disputes. A basic tenant of the Pax Christi
argument against war is that it is now out-
dated.

We are technologically beyond the point
where we can win a war, that is. With a
reasonable loss of life. Gower said In
World War II. about 52 million lives were
lost. But Gower said the United States
Navy alone now has the capability to kill 60
billion people Yet there are only about
tour billion people on earth,

Gower discussed some of the nuclear
weapons the United States has and is
developing. Currently, we have 31
Poseiden submarines. Each sub has 160
missiles. These missiles can cause three to
four times as much damage as was done to
Hiroshima. And the subs can stay at sea
tor three months

We are building 11 Trident subs, also,
They are live stories high and 1560 feet
long, much larger than the Poseidens, We
have 408 B-52 bombers. It is not known exs
actly what the Russian nuclear force is
but, Gower said, the United States can
strike much faster and more accurately
than can the U.S.S.R

Regarding the likelihood of nuclear war,
Gower said, “Many people in the ﬁeld say
a nuclear war is ‘highly probable' before
the year 2000." He said that iiwe do notget
rid of nuclear weapons we will definitely
use them. But Gower does not think the
United States or the USSR. will be the
first to strike He said they both have too
much to lose by starting a nuclear war.
The Third World nations are developing
nuclear weapons and have more to gain
than lose by initiating their use. Gower
argued that neither oi the large countries
would drop a bomb knowing the other
would do the same In response. He said the
United States would not have bombed
Hiroshima and Nagasaki if it had thought
the Japanese would. in return, destroy Los
Angeles and San Francisco.

The key to preventing nuclear prolirera-
tion and subsequent war, said Gower, is
grass roots movements and passive, none
violent resistance. Pax Christi is ems
phasizing the need tor a nuclear arms
treeze. According to Gower, people should

‘unite for one cause to push it through
before going on to the next.

the US Senate and House of Represenr
tatives

The bill introduced by Senators Kennedy
and Hatsrield proposes that the United
States and the Soviet Union immediately
halt further production of nuclear
weaponry. This {reczc legislation is sup-
ported by approximately 22 senators and
its counterpart in the House, proposed by
Representatives Conte, Markey and
Bingham, has the approval or 113
representatives.

Opposing the KennedyHatslield legislar
tion is a bill submitted by Senators
Jackson and Warner, This proposal is has
ed on an assumption that the Soviet Union
holds a nuclear superiority over the
United States The Jacksoanarner bill
would allow the United States to complete
its proposed nuclear weapons plans, reach
“parity" with the Russians, then negotiate
a freeze.

Although the WarnersJackson bill is sup»
ported by the administration or President
Ronald Reagan, some people believe its
basic assumption is erroneous Coor~
dinator oi the Iowa Freeze Campaign Tim
Button said, “it's inaccurate to assume
we're behind the Soviets. It's very clear
that we have parity with the Soviets." The
effect of the Jackson-Warner bill, he
believed, would be to create “a whole new
generation oi nuclear weapons." Alter
production of the MX missle. 3,1 Bombers,
Pershing Two Missrles and the Trident
Submarine. “We'll become superior to the
Soviet Union, clearly,” he said. ”And to
talk about who has more of this and that
when we have so much overkill is
ridiculous. Right now we're at parity —
it's the most opportune time to have a
freeze.”

The Council for a Liveable World, based
in Washington, D.C. has proposed an “ac»
tion request," which consists of three

points. The iirst request is to cut overall -

deiense spending by $10,t,o 520 billion.

Secondly, the group is asking Congress to
“kill the MX program." The final proposal
is to lower the production ()1 chemical
weapons.
