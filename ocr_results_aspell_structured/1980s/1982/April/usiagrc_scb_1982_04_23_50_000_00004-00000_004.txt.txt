premier ska band” will play Saturday at 7:30 pm
on Ward Held near Darby Gymnasmm. As the uni

A mtxtuie at rock and roll and reggae, ska’s light,
bouncy rhythm appeals to reggae, rock and new
wave lans alike American ska evolved lrorn
Engllsh ska which in turn grew out oi Jamaican
reggae, and the popularity oi Heavy Manners con
tinues to grow. The band’s name is lamaican siang
tor "under discipline," a reierence to martial law.

Heavy Manners has a “total ireshness that sets it
apart irom other bands, ska or not," said Chicago

rr Movie is oiten runny, occasionally in bad

taste but overall light hearted and lun it iollows a

tradition set by movies such as the croove Tube

and Tunnelvisioii. In some ways this movie is a

National lampoon that talks and moves.

it otters a comptlatten oi 22 very broad show biz
parodies whtch, according to Time, "are a ed at
sophmoric sensibilities." Television is the inspira-
tion iot much oi the satire wllh commercials,
news shows, talk shows and a '505 style Cour»
troom drama all serving as targets.

Two of the more memorable tommercrals are a
beer commercial in whtch those seeking gusto
item the suds are a group ol Hare Klishna sect
members coming in alter a hard day’s chanting
and leaner peddaling and an instituional plug lrom

The group's iirst single, ”Flaming Flrsl,” released
in the summerol 1931, is ”a phenomenally catchy
song which never tails to get people dancing” ac
cording to the director oi music at WNUK, Nora
thwestem University/s radio station. Thar si le
got a lot oi air play and was snatched up by Ians in
chicago area record stores, ”Walling tor the
CIlSIS” was therr next hit single whldl put Heavy
Manners in the toreiront oi the midwest music
scene, Since dien, the singles ”Taklng the Queen
to Tea, ”Homelawn Ska,” "Jamaica” and "Old
Mari Bates is Dead" have been released on
”Dlstulbing Records,” a Chicagoarea cooperative
label. oh the same label, l<ate Pagan came out
with the single ~Don't Want To be loo Coal."

Along with their originals, Heavy Manners does
versions ol Bob Marley’s ”Funky Reggae PartY' and
The Engllsh bears "Twlst and Crawl.”

Besides ragan, an origlnal organizer tor
Chicago's "Rock Against Racism” concert and lead
vocalist and keyboard player, the band leatures
rtankie Hill on saxophone, Mitch Kohlagan, a
lormer DJ tor a reggae club, on guitar, ”Staleslde"

an oil company experimentally reclaiming oil lrorti
greasy containers cast oh by iast~iood restaurants.

Movies are its next target, ”Cleopatra Schwartz”
dealing with the love oi a black superman and a
Hasldic rabbi is this movle's comment on black ex-
ploitation iilms. Disaster movies, soit core porn,
martial arts, sex records and charity appeals are
also among the satiric parodies.

Some oi the episodes are hysterical, some are
oiiensive and some just tall ilat irom overkill ll
you're easily oiiended, this may not be the movie
ior you. But it you're in the mood lor some
mindless tun, this should prove to be an ap
proprtate introduction to Relays Weekend. In-
cidentally, this is the iirst etlort or Director John
Landls whose ”American Werewolf in tendon”
was one oi the iunniest, most underpubliozed
and underrated movies oi the past summer —

Heavy Manners is an upandccoming band in the

spoken sound iilm ever made still has mainly
printed titles but it does include a number oi
scenes oi dialogue, some oi them apparently imc
prompto, and six songs by the iamous popular
singer, Al lolson. The trim created a sensation in
1917 that the Several earller sound ﬁlms, which
leatured only music, could not — largely due to
the poweriul and vibrant singing oi Jolson.

The story is rather traditional and designed to
assault the emotions oi the audience. Jolson plays
lackie itabinowitz, who is passionately attached to
his mother but rebels against his iather by singing
popular songs in a local bar. Aitet several beatings
by his lather, he runs away to the btg city where
he becomes a laraous vaudville periorinet. Alter
several years, he returns to share his success with
his iamily, only to be once again reiecteci by his
lather. He then races a choice between the iamrly
and the levyish tradition he has iorsaken (he’s
even changed his name to tackle liobinl and his
addiction, the stage. I Imagine you can iigure out
his deosion. Wlllle the hlm is rather dated and
wrenchingly sentimental, it’s still quite a look at
the period and an entertaining rtim. Besides, who
