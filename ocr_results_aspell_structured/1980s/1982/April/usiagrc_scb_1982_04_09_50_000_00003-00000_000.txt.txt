A problem which seems to plague 1(ch

the number of record thefts is much
greater than in the past few years accorr

honor system within the record library.

The recordings usually disappear tor

Manager i-larriet chasins. Even though
KDIC has a system tor recording the discs
at the station. recordsare still ‘fborrowed"
lor taping or other purposes This is not the
most serious porblem since there records
are returned but often not before they are
missed by a number of JD's. The other
more serious problem which hampers the
station is record theft. It seems that there
are a few persons. as there are every year.
who help themselves to the record collec~
tion at the radio station, It is usually the
more popular records that are lined and
quickly missed upon their disappearance

There has been a steady decline in the
number oi records that KDIC has been
given by the record industry. Prior to
about 1580. record companies were
relatively generous with their giving of
records to colleges and universities Due to
the crunch in the industry, however, many
companies are distributing fewer and

lewer records particularly to small col»
leges and universities. One of the areas of
music to be severely cut by record com-
panies is rock music. Some companies
believe that the desire for rock music is
great enough that the individual stations
will purchase this music on their own
KDIC does have a budget for purchasing
records but the station heavily depends on
promotional records from various record
companies. There have been questions of
late regarding the purchase or newer
albums by station management due to
their questionable longevity at KDIC

Some of KDIC's DJ'S have even sug
gested closing the station because of the
ditliculty in tailoring a good music show
when so many of the better albums have
been borrowed or stolen. The move would
be extreme but if the thefts continue to in-
crease it will become a possibility

The station management has madc it
clear that first, it would be thankful for
any records returned yoluntarily and se-
cond. record thefts are not overlooked, The
missing music is needed at the station and
records thieves havebeen caught in the
past. Under the rules and regulations of
the college. anyone who is caught remov»
ing recordings from kDic can be punish-
ed. '

Ebersole, Solis teach
evening Japanese class

by Katie Ingwersen

There are currently 15 students enrolled
in a Japanese class taught by Donna Solis
and Noriko Ebersole at the. Ebersole's
home. The one-semester class meets twice
a week and costs 550. Students who coma
plete the course receive a certificate of
equiviiancy for tour credits in Japanese at
the end at the semester. According to
Ebersole, however, the Credit will not be
recorded on student's transcripts and can
not be used as credit toward graduation,
Ebersole hopes that this policy will be
changed. If Grinnell College credit does
become available, it will not be effective
until Spring semester or ‘iio,

Whether or not the credit students
receive counts toward graduation, there is
“no possiblility or a Japanses department
atlcrinnell in the near future," said Eberr
so 9.

The class has just completed learning
the Hirogana alphabet, which is composed
of 46 symbols and vairations. According to
Mary Schulzc, a student in thc class, it is
easy to begin speaking Japanese because

there is only one word for all tenses of the
verb “to be" and it is never conjugated
conceivably, everyone in the class now
knows the grammatical structure or
Hirogana and is working on increasing
vocabulary.

According to Ebersole, she and Solis
started the class, which began in January.
because several students last fall showed
interest in learning Japanese This
semester, all students in the class are
beginners Next year, however, classes in
both lirstand second year Japanese will be
available Many students enrolled in the
class are planning on going to Japan next
year or the iollowing year and would
rather take a semesterclong class than a
"crash course" over the summer

Next year, second semester students
will learn the Kataganan alphabet, which
is used to express words that are not
originally Japanese or Chinese, They will
also learn some KanJi, which are Chinese
characters.
