KDIC nabs thief, but

doesn' t

by Dan Nissenb aum
KDlC Station Manager Chris Ertel and

Music Director Chris Fousek set a prece-
dent this week which they hope will reduce
the number of records stolen from the sta—
tion’s music library.

,Acting on an anonymous tip, the two
KDIC representatives obtained a warrant
from the Judicial Council and subsequent-
ly discovered two stolen albums during a
search of the suspect's room.

Record theft has “always been a pro-
blem," explained Fousek, “but it’s gotten
much worse in the past few weeks." The
number of stolen albums has reached 20 in
only the past two to three week period. Out
of the total record stock, Ertel commented
that, “the percentage is rough. . . the pro-
blem is that it's our best quality stuff.”

In. this particular case, Ertel and Fousek
decided to bargain with the student rather
than initiate a judicial hearing process.
The student, who is not a disc jockey, was
given the option of facing a Judicial Coun<
cil hearing, or recovering several other
stolen albums.

The college administration indicated
their support by categorizing the incident
as a theft from college property, which
could involve a heavy punishment such as

. conduct probation.

The student produced several other

albums in accordance with the dealr Ertel

press charges

believes that “Most people mat have
(stolen) albums know others who also
have theml" The KDIC staff is now in the
process of tollowing two other leads con-
cerning stolen property. Although the
thelts have been on the increase, more
people are starting to report the thefts.

Last year, the entire collection of The
Who disappeared, and this year the
thieves’ most favored targets .nclude
albums by The Beatles, The Police, The
Clash, The Rolling Stones and Elvis
Costello, “It's everyone's problem,”
lamented Fousek, “It hurts the students by
cutting down on requests."

“Typically,” he continued, “the word
gets around, and the albums reappear."
The standard procedure carried out by the
staff includes a brief stock check three
times a day, and a new policy which
directs the DJs to list any missing albums
to speed up the recovery process.

The staff cautioned that they y take
other offenders to Judicial Counc in their
continued efforts to preserve the record
stock. One DJ has already been fired this
semester because of theft, at normal conse-
quence in that circumstance.

Another measure under consideration is
to withhold the $1500 granted by the SGA
from the Excess Revenue Fund to KDIC
until more stolen albums are returned.

Sloan awards
college 7/4
mil/Ion

Grinnell College has been named as one
of 10 liberal~arts colleges in the U.S.
receiving grants of $25,000 from the Alfred
P. Sloan Foundation for support oi new
studies “in quantitatlve problem-solving,
applied mathematics and modern
technology,” (5&3, Sept. 10,1932)

President George Drake said that the
total of two and one-half million dollars in
grants “represents not only a significant
iniusion of money into the process of
liberalrarts education but also an historic
turning of these institutions toward what
the Sloan Foundation rightly calls ‘the new
liberal arts.’ ”

Besides Grinnell, the following schools
will receive the Sloan grants: Carleton,
Davidson, Lafayette, Mount Holyoke,
Oberlin, Union, Vassar, Wellesley and
Williams

In announcing the grants, the Sloan
Foundation cited the need of many
students, particularly in the humanities
and social sciences, to do substantially
more college work in quantitative reasone
mg.

The announcement said that ”Such
students are reaching the end of their for-
mal education poorly equipped with the
kind of quantitative knowledge and skills
they need throughout their live in a high
technology society.“

The foundation’s president, Albert Rees,
noted that “reestablishing quantitative
study as a natural and integral part of a
liberal education will be no simple pro»
blem for the colleges receiving these
grants."

Grinnell's program will involve three
levels or stages. 1) a series of “designated
problem solving courses" aimed at
strengthening the quantitative skills of all
students early in their college careers; 2)
a mathematical-modeling component in
sophomore and junior courses intended to
further students’ experiences with rapidly
changing quantitative methods in the
social and life sciences; and a) a pilot pro-
ject aimed at using problem solving activi-
ty in senior seminars on diirerent
technologies and their implications, and

internships and other off— campus pro-

grams in technology and modern society.

The plan involves revising or creating at
least as courses and giving a major portion
of the Grinnell raculty greater proficiency
and broader experience in quantitative
problem- solving.

Faculty meet in Newton to discuss
possible curricUlum changes

by Susan Burke

Last Saturday's iactdty meeting in
Newton spurred some students to suspect
that the faculty were meeting in secrecy to
implement a core curriculum. However, it
was “Not a discussion of core
curriculum," said Professor Morris
Parslow, coordinator of curriculum
development. The November 13 meeting
was only one in an ongoing series to deter-
mine the need ror curricular change, the
types or changes to he made and how they
are to be implemented.

The first full day meeting, which took
place in August of 1981 made it “clear that
people (the faculty) wanted some informa
tion on the present state of affairs,” ex-
plained Dean Catherine Frazer. Alter that
first meeting she and President Drake met
with four groups of faculty and decided
that there was enough interest on the part
of the faculty to Warrant a formal cure
ricular review.

Saturday‘s meeting served as part of
that review, with reports being given
about the present state of affairs at Grin-
nell and future programs. An admissions
report was given entitled, “What do they
bring with them?" “What do they do while
they are here?" was the second topic,

Under the latter topic three areas were ad-
dressed: the tutorial system, the writing
program and an analysis of transcripts to
interpret the ﬁgures, The third topic was
grants and proposals, with subtopics on
the Mellon grant, computer literacy and
the Sloan grant.

After the presentations, the faculty
members split up into three groups, each
with two leaders to discuss the presenta-
tions and to air ideas and opinions on possi
ble ways of improving the curriculum.
Frazer, who listened in on all the groups,
said that she thinks “enough good sugges-
tions came out of those meetings that we
can put together a draft of proposals,"
Parslow sald that there was generally a
“consensus that the faculty is receptive to
proposals for more structure” in the Grin-
nell curriculum.

The proposals that will arise out of this
meeting and many smaller meetings will
probably be presented early next semester
according to Parslow, but he doesn't
foresee any legislation coming to the facul—
ty beiore next fall. Dean Frazer agreed
that it would be “a matter of months" for
proposals to be presented, then discussed
and then agreed upon.

Computer program gets big boost

At its November meeting. the Board of
Tnisteos voted to support a $2 million pro-
posal for a comprehensive computing and
quantitativestudies program at Grinnell
College.

The new computer improvement project
will besupported tram a special ”venture“
rund set up by the Grinnell trustees from
endowment income. The four—year effort
calls for campus-wide development of
hardware and software aimed at making
Grinnell “practically unique among
liberal-arts colleges" in computing and
quantitative problemsolving.

The program is the first to be supported
from the venture fund, established a year
ago as a means of translating some of the
income from Grinnell‘s highly successful
inmtments into new or stronger offerings
for the college’s 1, 200 students

The venture fund 5 income is drawn
from an endowment, now valued at about
$100 million, which got its most dramatic
boost from the sale last year or a commerr
cial television station at a profit of some
535 million.

Speciiic objectives of the program are:

7 To establish 'a fully—developed cam-
pus computer network‘ serving students,
faculty and administrative staff;

— To provide opportunity for all
students and faculty to gain knowledge of
the methods of problemesolving and to
become computer literate at levels which

allow successful application of these
skills;

- — To expand the use of computing and
quantitative analysis in classrooms and
laboratories and to introduce these techni-
ones in areas not presently using them;

— To provide students with a chance to
acquire specialized knowledge in com-
puter science:

— To provide the generalpurpose tools
that support the learning process in almost
any field (e.g., text processing,
bibliographic Search, etc);

— To improve the college’s capability
for analysis and information processing in
the area of administrative data manage-
ment; -

7 To develop a substantial array of
workshops, institutes, etc., to take advan-
tage of the college's excellent facilities for
summer programs, a related objective be-
ing to spur interest in, and appreciation
for, the college’s program by prospective
students, high school teachers, counselors,
etc.:

e To provide students and iaculty with
increased capability in using computer

graphics as an important tool in quan~

titative studies, and ' ‘ ‘ ‘

7 To develop this network or computer
communications in such a way that it will
meet current needs as well as provide
maxtmum ﬂexibility for adapting to future
developments in computing.
