taught to be simple, decent people, Maybe
it’s too easy — or too hard,

Where in the system oi higher education
are these virtues taught? Literature?
Maybe, but it gets dlstorted when we insist
on analyzing it into some worthless image
or symbol. History? Nobody makes history

A by simply being a decent person, Art'.’ The
sciences? Ijust can’t find it,

Which brings me back to a good, kind,
helpiul man, who made me think more
than most classes do, and never even knew
it. The loss is great, and I’m left ieeling
stupid. What have I been so concerned
about lately? In the context of that wonder-
ful term, “the Grinnell Experience." how
do I live up to the values of basic decency,
kindness and concern?

Death makes us think about ourselves, a
sad comment on a society that stresses
such ”great” achievements. Maybe if we

took one time to think, not about greatness,‘

but about being simply good, we really
could accomplish something.

instead, I’ll do the same stupid thing I've
always done: I'll forget. It's the easy way
out. but it is painless:

Students who voted for Carl in the elec-

tion can rest assured that she did win the
election, as the results of the recount were
identical to the returns of election night.
Those results give one a warm feeling and
peace of mind that Grinnellians re-elected
someone like Carl, who Will continue to
work ior programs that will allow those oi
the elderly, who can no longer take care oi
themselves adequately, the in-home care
that will allow them to stay at home
without having to undergo the trauma oi

homes. students showed great prudence in
selecting those people who make the pur-
pose ot government the pursuit of social
justice and compassion for all.

Grinnell students should continue to
register to vote and vote in every election,
as they have proved that their voice can
not only be heard, but can be a determin
ing factor in an election.

A couple of weeks ago i received the lash

I liked it. i had been wondering ii anyone
had even been reading all the things I
wrote this semester, so it was gratiiying to
near from‘a reader, even though he seemr
ed displeased with my article dealing with
the results oi the election The letter was
certainly effective in giving me the reputar
tion as a highly partisan activist, a reputa-
tion 1 have not been able to dispel trom
anyone's mind all semester.

I have always considered myself a
liberal first and Democrat second, though
it seemed all semester the other way
around to the casual observer. I worked
only to elect people whom I thought best
represented what the course or govern-
ment should be; I worked for no one mercr
ly because they were oi one party or
another, Thanks again Andy Paul for your

Culture Shock: Iowa Style

When you start your day with Santa ilying
into the Newton Shopping Mall in a

There we were on me Friday aiter
Thanksgiving, the oiiicial opening oi the
Christmas shopping season, in Newton get
ting a junk-iood hit at Mickey D’s (that's
McDonald's ior those oi you who aren't hip
to the lingo). As we were driving back
towards Grinnell I noticed a helicopter
hovering overhead. Then we saw a
billboard proclaiming: “SANTA AR»
RIVES BY HELICOPTER,AT 1 RM,”
Seiko said that it was 12:58, Everyone in
the car realized that dais was certainly
something that couldn’t be missed so we
tore into the parking lot,

We arrived just in time to see Santa plop
out or the sky in this gloritied lawnmower.
Kids went rushing up to get a closer look
and one little girl ran by us with Christmas
list in hand.

Many of my companions suggest we get

overrule the idea muttering to myself that

Our next scene takes place later that

I’ve mentioned before, I’m tough. I can
take the‘slings and arrows oi abuse, but
rather than embarass any of my fellow

Fire away, those slings and arrows don’t

FTARH is a movie about sex and drugs
and rock n’ roll in its purst sense. It's the
epitome oi “Val Gal" and everything
”totally awesome" that the great state of

California has given to our society.

It would be unfair of me not to
acknowledge the bias from which I wrlte.
Growing up in a racially integrated
neighborhood on the south side of Chicago
tends to make me more than a bit snide in
my attitutde towards rich, white, Califorr

to do than sit around their pools or spend
all day worshiping, I mean, waxing their
cars But this is the lite portrayed on
screen in FTARH.

But what about the lite portrayed in die
audience Letter jackets and Farrah hairs

nell is pumped to see the R-rated movie.
FTARH was made for them, and they were
there to eat it up, Scream, giggle sing
along with all the Top 40 hits, and com-
pletely lose it over the sterotyped burnout
character whose stock response is: “Narly

It was all too much for this urban

To the Editor:

Upon reading the 29 October issue of the
Scarlet and Black, particularly the
editorial tstc) by Richard Letchinger “My
Break: A Scary Trip," my views concern
ing the pomposlty and arrogance of the
priviledged Grinnell elite were further
coniirmed, Presently, lam a junior at the
Univeristy oi Wisconsin, studying abroad
at the London School of Economics 7 unr
fortunately I share accommodations with
another Grinnell student: JOHN
OSTRANDER, My initial reaction to
JOHN Was that he was an "“hole — subse-
quently, this has been reaiiirmed.
Nonetheless, I have attempted to avoid
jumping to any hasty conclusions about
JOHN‘S character or the school that he
represents. 0n the other hand, Mr Let-
chingcr, who obviously must be endowed
with the superior intelligence that only
private schooling can provide, only needed
one short weekend to judge and condemn
an entire university of 40,000 students, I
urge Mr, Letchinger not to be so narrow
minded and to revisit the University of
Wisconsin without going to a football game
and sitting in sections 0 andP. Similarly, i
am interested in meeting Grinnell
students, such as Paul Callen, Ken Coyle
and Jimmy Robinson. — Sincerely, Adam
Heavenrich, Unlvcrslty Wisconsin, Class
of '84

To whom it may concern at the SM; —
My roommate Adam wrote this letter with
my guidance and approval 7 Yours truly,
Johnny Ostrander

Mr. Letchinger responds: Mr,
Heavenrich should first be made aware
that the piece in question was not an
editorial, as he states, but a column stating
my own opinions and not those of the 8&3.

Yes, Mr. Heavenrich, I have “been en-
dowed with the superior intelligence mat
only private schooling can provide" in
high school, and so has my friend whom I
visited at Wisconsin, The difference is that
he has been at Wisconsin so long that he’s
forgotten everything he was privileged to
learn, Wisconsin did that to him, sitting in

section P has done that to him. and going

to school with narrow-minded dolts like
you has done that to him.
Is that pompous enough ior you?

Update on
Buffer Days
Committee's

progress

This article will serve to update the cam-
pus community as to our previous and
future efforts to alleviate the “buffer
days" problem.

On November 8 we went before the Coma
mittee on Academic Standing iCAS) to
present our proposal to add another buiier
day to each semester oi the 193371934
school year. We had been hopeiul that the
CAS would make a recommendation to the
iaculty to adopt our proposal, however on
November 22 the CAS decided to make no
recommendation and simply to put the
issue on the agenda of the next iaculty
meeting on Monday. At that time the
members of the CAS Wlll offer their obsel'r
Vations on thc issue. As the‘situation
stands now the CA5 will probably present
several alternatives aside from the addi-
tion oi butter days

1, Creating a "dead week" i,e, no major
exams could be given nor papers exr
cceding three pages could be due during
the week prior to finals.

2. Requiring that a certain percentage oi
a course grade be completed by the fourth
week of the semester.

3. Requiring that the final exam not ex-
ceed a certain percentage of the course
grade.

And what about buffer days? Frankly,

' 'without a positive recommendation from

the CAS, the faculty willprobably not con:

sider adding another butter day to each
semester next year: Why? The major ob-
jection raised by the CAS was that a com-
milment had been made by the faculty and
administration to stick to the present
calendar for at least two years. This cer-
tainly came as a surprise to us since
Catherine Frazer, dean oi the iaculty had
previously told us that a change in the
calendar such as we proposed was possi-
ble. The members of the CAS also seemed
to feel that the amount of work put into the
creation of the present calendar justified
giving it at least a trial run

or course, President Drake's request
that Commencement be on a Monday (our
plan would have shiited it to a Tuesday as
it has been in years past) carried some
weight despite the fact that in actuality one
ly 10-12 people have complained.

Citing the aiorementioned objections to
our plan the CAS gave every indication
that the addition of another buffer day to
each semester would not be considered. of
course we were disappointed * we still
feel that our plan offers the best solution to
the inadequacy oi study time at the end oi
the semester. Class syllabi would not be af,
fected (one problem with the dead week
planl We also ieel that comprehensive
finals require a lot of study time no matter
what percentage of the grade they may
comprise.

We were also disappointed by the kinds
oi perceptions some of die members of the
CAS seem to harbor about students and
student lite, These perceptions were ex-
pressed in generalizations such as “Well,
you know that most students don't work
over fall break. , . ” and “giving the
students more time to study will mean only
more procrastination. . ” We wonder
about the validity of these generalizations
and furthermore we think that they pro
vide a poor excuse for ignoring the iact
that a large number of students on this
campus do not have enough time made
quately assimilate Course materials and
prepare ior final exams.

A solution oi some kind, be it a dead
week or more buffer days is imperative. It
is our hope that the [acuity will realize
this, and that next Monday when they
meet, the inadequacy oi study time at the
end of the semester will finally be given
the attention it justly deserves. Signed,
