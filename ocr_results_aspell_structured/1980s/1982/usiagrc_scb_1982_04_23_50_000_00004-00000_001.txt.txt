Decade of decadence: a history of

it all started nine years ago, on a balmy spring
. night early in May. Listen-

”I was outside the library talking to a couple of
my students," reflected Associate Prolessor oi
l’olitical Science Wayne Meyer. ”Somehow we
got to discussing the academic tension present on
campus and how the community here might get
together in the spirit oi good iun ior a day of pleac
sant relaxation. Thats how the idea (or the Relays
was born."

Prior to coming to Grinnell, Moyer had been
working in Connecticut at Yale University. "Those
were, oi course, very tough times poli tally," he
Sald. "The Martin Lulher King assaslnalicn, Kent
State and Vietnam were among several tense
thing occupying the minds oi everyone, students
included, in the spring oi 1971, it appeared that
vietnman was slowly dying down and students at
Yale were looking to organize some sort oi event
that would help ease political and academic lenc
sions on campus. 50 what happened was that two
oi the colleges there, Berkeley and Calhoun, put
together a kind oi iun olyrnpics. They got beer
and organized various events and all in all it came
out really well. Everybody had a really iun time."

Those Berkeley/Calhoun olympics were to
become the inspiration tor what is now known as
the Grinnell Relays. Mover met with a iew
students, including the SCA president, and lair
mulated what should make up the Relays. Many
oi the events that had been run at Yale were
transiered here, with the act es being presided
over by Master oi Ceremonies Moyer, a lunction
that has become an integral tradition oi the Crin-
nell Relays.

”Al liist the administiaiton was somewhat skep-
tical ol the whole thing" said Mover "Sui alter

they saw that everything could run smoothly.
they became supportive oi the event. Or at least
they tolerated it H

since that lirst year, Meyer has played a much
less active role in the oganization oi the party lts
a siudenHun thing," he said. I preier to be more
in the background, as tar as participation in
(Relays) committee decisions goes."

Over the years, Grinnell’s Relays have become a
secure part oi the Crlnnell Experience, with the
number oi kegs increasing as participation in the
events has increased Some new events have
been added, such as the parade and all-campus
dinner but generally they have stayed iairly con-
sistent with what made up the original party.

Occasionally there have been some unpopular
elements, such as the inlamous mudvpll, but these
have been discouraged and thus have dwindled
into non-existence. The only remaining controver-
sial ”lladltlon” is the Beer, Bacon and Beaver
areakiast, a happening that is only attended by a
very small minority. "I don't like the breakiast,~
Moyer said. ”Ii detracts itom the quality oi the
Relays. The event tends to divide the campus
community, which is wrong. The purpose oi
Relays is to bring people closer together in the
spirit ol good lun, inendship and relaxation. The
BBB breaklast has never been a real part oi Relays.
l like the idea oi the Bloody Mary breaklast,
though , I’ll detinitely be there ioi that N This oir
licial breakiast will take place at 10 30 on satuday
morning in Younker lounge.

Also occurring this year is the seventh edition oi
the Titular Head contest, a crazed kind oi “Kalenr'
([hal word is used lightly in this context) show,
ivhosewinnei gets to ride in all oi his or her glory

in the Relays Parade. The contest will take place
tonight at 9:30 pm. in Darby Gym, while the
parade will leave Quad Saturday at noon.

in the past, Relays committees, always sell
selected by students, have consisted oi veteran
members (to. those who had participated in the
event the previous year) as well as new interested
people. This system worked ﬁne until last year,
when the "(halrl” was broken: evenybody on the
committee was a senior. Thereiore, this spring
there were no clear successors ior the task oi
organizing the event.

There was no heir apparent this year," Moyei
sai "There were some people who had close ties
with last year's group and then some others.
Essenually you could call them two groups, with
the main diilerence being one was promud pit
and one was anti-mud pit. For a while I was cont
cerned‘, I’ve always wanted the organizers to be
responsible students, otherwise it would
deteriorate to something Relays shouldn't be Bul
apparently theyve gotten together and worked
out a system oi dividing the responsibilities. l've
spoken to the committee members, there lsn‘l gm
ing to be a mud pit and it seems like |hey’le doing
a good ice at organixlng.”

So tomorrow marks the ioth annual ciinnell
Relays; a ”decade oi decadence” or so the posters
say. The games begin atl p m with lotsol beer to
help quench your thirst. M s p m. the allccampus
picnic will take place and at 7.20 pm., Heavy
