Grace nerlou ends _-
consequences exnlainetl

This Sunday, Feb. 28, marks the end of the Selective Service System’s
“grace period," during which men who were required to register for the
draft before Jan. 8 could do so without fear of prosecution For the US.
Department of Justice and federal district attorneys, this means a
heavier work load, because they will have to start prosecuting men who
failed to register. For those men born after Jan. 1, 1960, who did not stop
by their local post offices to fill out the SSS form, it means preparing for
possible visits by the FBI, letters from the Justice Department and a
sentence of up to five years in prison and/or a fine of $10,000 It should
also mean that they begin to consider compiling files of evidence to pro-
ve their opposition to military service.

Registration for a possible draft has been mandatory for 187year-old
male citizens since it was affected by President Jimmy Carter in July,

-1980. Quite unfairly, their female counterparts were exempted from the

duty by a 1981 Supreme Court ruling. Under Title 50 of the U.S. Code Sec»
tion 462-A, these men are required to complete the registration form
within 30 days of their 18th birthday. In the first five months of the pro-
gram, 97 percent of those obligated to sign up did so. But since Ronald
Reagan took office, dais figure has dropped to 73 percent. According to
Carol McNeil], director of the Draft and Military Counseling Program of
the Central Committee for Conscientious objectors (CCCO) in a
telephone interview with the 5813 Wednesday, “Since the numbers are
based on the 1980 census, which is low, we suspect that a smaller percen-
tage actually registered.”

The grace period was announced Jan. 20 by Selective Service Director
Turnage, following Reagan’s Jan. 7 reversal of his anti-registration
stand, Yet even before Reagan's f'lipeflop, US. News and World Report
wrote Aug. 3, 1981, that the Selective Service had in June turned over
names of 134 non-registrants to the Justice Department And the US.
District Attorney in Minnesota planned last December to indict a non
registrant who had made his case public. This indictment was stopped,
however, so Reagan could decide whether to continue the program.

These cases, then, could be taken up again as soon as Monday. But
McNeill believed legal action will not begin until late March and John
Russell, Justice Department spokesman, has indicated that prosecution
might not start until this summer, when college students will be in their
home districts. If and when prosecution does occur, the first group of
men to be indicted will be the approximately 200 who have made their
opposition public by notifying varying branches of government that they
do not plan to register. The names of others in this group were turned in-
to federal authorities by fellow citizens. ‘The SSS may also track non-
registrants by looking at social security numbers’and revenue files.

An interesting sidelight to this issue that the federal government has
not beenpublicizing, however, is that it is now creating draft boards in
most states, Following to past procedure, the SSS interviews prospec—
tive board members and the government usually accepts them
automatically. Although mere is an official move to include Third World
natives and women, McNeill reported that selections thus far have been
“pretty conservative,” with the SSS recruiting mainly from such groups
as the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

Considering the record of prosecution during the Vietnam War era,
however, there seems to be little reason to panic. According to a report
of the Amnesty Program created by President Gerald Ford, less than
one percent of the American men who did not register or refused induct-
ment were punished, And the punishments these men received were not
as strict as law allowed. Instead, most served twdyear sentences or had
their sentences probatedr

Although the threat of prosecution may seem insignificant and dis-
tant, men eligible for registration should be thinking about the alter
natives to registration that are available to them. A number of bills are
currently» before Congress which would greatly reduce the number of ex
ceptions allowed to men who may be drafted in the future. Although
these bills would insure that all sections of society are included in com-
pulsory service, they also mean that the option of conscientious objecc-
tion must be well planned. Because federal law may give inductees only
10 days between receiving a draft notice and filing an exemption,
Chaplain Dennis Haas urges men who are considering C0 status to
beign preparing their files immediately. Approximately 15 Grinnell
students have already done so but for those unsure about what C0
means or how to go about it, Haas is available to help. More literature is
also posted in the Religious Activities Room in Steiner Hall.

There have been some strange twists to the S&B‘s Feb. 12 editorial,
“Information gap widened this week,” which we believe must be ex-
plained.

First, it appears that the information gap we accused the college ad-
ministration of prepetrating was not the only one affecting us, When an
5&3 reporter previewed the Board of Trustees’ visit with President
George Drake, he did, in fact, acknowledge that student fees would be
raised when the board revised the budget, as it does annuallyr He could
not, however, reveal any specific amount of increase, because it had not
been decided by the members. The reporter then gave this information
to 8&8 editors and, because no specific figure was mentioned, it was lost
in the deadline rush.

Reporters then talked after the meetings to Chairman of the Board
Fritz Maytag, who did not mention the increase. l-lis forgetfulness may
have stemmed from his belief that “It is the president’s budget, We pick
the president but it is up to him to devise the budget."

The mix-ups continued the following week because Drake was raising
funds out of town and therefore could not be reached for comment. We
did not next contact the Office of College Relations because we figured
Maytag would have told us all, Director of that office and 8&3 profes-
sional adviser William Deminoff contacted the 58:13 Wednesday after-
noon, the deadline for Friday’s issue, and gave the same letter received
by all students and parents to News Editor Laura McDermith. Having
already seen the letter and having no time to investigate further, she
dismissed the importance of a member of the administration actually
handing the information to the 5&3.

So, in the end, we were mistaken in saying the administration did not
inform us, and thereby the students, of the fee hike, For that we are
sorry. But we believe it is important to realize that after talking to
Maytag, and knowing Drake was unavailable for comment, we thought
we had all the information that was going to be released by the ad-
ministration or trustees,

What we regret most about these gaps is that the main point of the
editorial now lacks credibility The complaints made about the lack of
information given students about such issues as the refusal to give
tenure to Assistant Professor of Philosophy Dan Magurshak and the
unexplained firings of Mark Grundler and Dave Renaud of Computer
Services are still valid. And on this point we stand firm ~ on most
issues, varying amounts of information is not revealed to students by the
Grinnell bureaucracy. But administrators now have an excuse for ignor-
ing this point.
