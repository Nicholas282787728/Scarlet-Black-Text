Draft law illegal.
prosecution» inconsistent

A US. district judge in California has ruled that the draft registration
law really is illegal. The Des Moines Rﬁf‘ister reported on Nov. 16 that
the judge said, “Draft registration reg ions are invalid because the
government did not follow proper procedure when it put the proclama-
tion into effect.”

After publication of the proclamation, the govermnent is sup sed to
wait 30 days for public comment before utting it into effect. e draft
law was begun only 21 days after its pub 'cation. As a result of this rul-
ing, charges against David Wayte, a 21-year-old draft resister in Califor-
nia were dropped.

Another reason for the dismissal of the case against Wayte was that
the government failed to prove that he was not the subject of discriminas
tion in the prosecution 0 draft resisters. It refused to present certain
documents and evidence which the defense wanted and did not let White
House Counselor Edwin Meese testify. Wayte maintains he had been
singled out for prosecution because of his outspoken views on registra-

The discrimination claim is common among those who have been or
are [being tried for resistance Rusty Martin, student body resident of
the University of Northern Iowa, is also among that num r. Martin
pleaded not guilty to the charges against him because he felt the law was
illegal even before it was declared so. The American Civil Liberties
Union holds the same view.

Original] , Martin did not register for the draft, but. the government
told him at there was enough information on him for him to be
registered. When Martin filed under the Freedom of Information Act in
1981 to get his FBI files he had to give his social security number. After-
wards, according to the Northern Iowan. Oct. 8, he received a letter
from the US. attorney for Iowa’s Northern District who told him the
federal government had enough information on him to conSlder him
registered for the draft.

Martin was also sent a copy of his registration card with all the infor-
mation on it except for his signature. He immediately sent notice that he
was refusing to register. However, the UNI student resrdent received
another letter from the attorne informing him that e was conSldered
registered and would not be in icted.

Martin blames the fact that he was indicted and is facing charges on
the govenment’s discrimnatory policy for prosecuting the resisters. In
the Nov. 16 issue of the Northern Iowan, Martin stated that he believes
“the reason they are prosecuting me now is the fact that I am a critic of
the program."

The federal government has made the grave mistake of failing to com—
ply with its own sanctions. If the government cannot even be consistent
in following its own laws, how can it expect citizens to follow them,
especially when at least this one’s constitutionality is-disputed?

The government has also demonstrated its inconsistency in pro-
secuting only those who are outspoken in the defiance of the law. It has
deliberately singled these men out to serve as examples instead of
equally punishing those who have not registered but are quieter about it.

Finally, the government cannot even get its story straight on whether
or not to indict Martin. It makes the reason for his indictment all the
more ambi uous —— has he broken the law by not registering for the
draft, or is e being discriminated against for speaking out against the
government?

Robert Viscusi of Brooklyn College
delivered an energetic, if not impassioned,
address on the core curriculum at the
Scholars’ Convocation a few weeks ago.
After much discussion with Viscusi and
further inquiries as to the nature of
Brooklyn's core, it is time to ask if
Brooklyn’s core is an appropriate model
for Grinnell.

No. During the course of his lecture, at
lunch and during a conversation after
lunch between several students and
Viscusi, he repeatedly stressed his doubts
about using Brooklyn's core as a model for
Grinnell. Brooklyn College has no organizr
ed advising program. when students meet
with a counselor to have their course
registration slips approved, the counselor
has no record of the course Work the stu-
dent has completed, and the possibility is
very great that in a school oi 15,000 the
counselor may not. even know the student.
Should the counselor not approve the stun
dent’s schedule, it is a small matter for the
student to find another counselor who will.
Specialization was, and still is, a great pro-
blem for the students and faculty of
Brooklyn; the core was initiated to combat

this problem, but an obligatory computer
scan to determine which core courses a
student has completed is a long way from
solving this problem.

When Brooklyn instituted an open ad-
missions policy in the ’603 it was ﬂooded
with students who had little or no language
skills. Cutbacks in Brooklyn's budget lore
ed a limit on enrollment to 15,000', but the
problem of poor preparation is still a ma-
jor concern. Students at Brooklyn are
flunking the core course in history simply
because they cannot read. Many of us may
suffer from undisciplined minds, but being
able to read above the Sixth grade level is
not a pressing concern for our faculty. The
core was instituted at Brooklyn to insure
that upon graduation the students were
capable of functioning at certain levels of
proficiency with which the Grinnell faculty
has never had to concern themselves, due
to our admissions policy and elitist tuition
costs. The Brooklyn core was meant to
raise the academic skills of their students
and to develop a liberal arts program to
counter the amount of specialization that
was rampant. ‘

The quest for the coldest fo

Seeing as how I‘ve been pretty somber
lately, l guess-I’ll do this to let all of you
know I’m not always somber. Please, don’t
look for any meaning; there isn’t any, ex-
Cept maybe some fun. In fact. there’s
nothing in it at all, except maybe a touch of
Sarcasm. It's worthless, save for a little bit
of Grinnellian patriotism. Now,
remember, this is not Grinnell, but only a
college a lot like it, because how could any
college be like this?

It was 9 o'clock at night, and I was ready
for the unexpected. I looked to the east,
past Gardner, and there, standing in an
odd robe, was a strange man. He beckoned
me forward and told me that I must search
for man's ultimate achievement on this
planet of ours Yes my friends, I was in-
structed to find the coldest water fountain
on campus. I begged him to release me
{mm the task, so heavy on my heart, but to
no avail, for his ears were closed to my

pleadings. 1 saw this shadowy ligure
receed into the misty air, his finger poms
ting towards Burling, and then pool, he
was gone.

The monks in Burling were friendly as
they escorted me to their illumination cells
on the top level. The closed, dark cubicles
with small windows reminded me of
reading carrels, but only in that they were
tables, for how could a student ever be ex-
pected to study in such a cramped and ill
lighted area without ventilation? Some of
the monks were discussing what to do in
case of a tire, but no conclusion was reach-
ed. 1 bent over the fountain, it’s sleek form
reflecting my plain visage. I sipped,
Nothing in the world could help that water.

The guard at the PEG watched from his
oddly red eyes at the lower level door, He
had obviously been placed there by some
higher force, for I had never seen him
there before. I knew I must carefully
guard my words. He asked me what I was
