Mrozek plays part of Slavic semester
Relations of individuals to each other explored in dark comedy

by Carol Farnes

Today through Tuesday at a pm. the
theater department is presenting three
one-act plays by Polish playwright
Slawomir Mrozek. The plays are entitled
”The Police," “The Party” and ”Out at
Sea " Because the plays are being held in
Arena Theater which has a small seating
capacity, ticket distribution will be held at
the Forum Desk.

"The Police” is directed by Jan
Czechowski, instructor in the theater
department, Student Rachel Slavick is
directing “The Party". “Out at Sea" is be
ing cardirected by Czechowski and
Slavick. The Mrozek plays were not the
original choice of the theater department.
instead, “Tally's Folly" by Laniord
Wilson was the first choice, but the rights
were withdrawn and consequently the
switch to Mrozek was made. They were
chosen by Czechowski. who saw two of the
plays while in Poland and was intrigued by
them.

The plays are included as a part of the
events for Slavic Semester. According to
Czechowski, there was “initially no rela-
tionship" between the plays and the
scheduled events. Rather, the plays were
chosen and then Sheila McCarthy of the
Russian department asked to include them
on the Slavic calendar. .

Although the Mrozek plays do not speak
directly to the current Polish crisis.
Czechowski reels they ~~are very apt lor
the time." The plays speak to individuals
relations to others and to the government
as well as about society in general. All or
the plays are satirical and humorous but
cannot be termed comedy. The situations

DIFFERENCE

in the plays more closely place the humor
in the realm or “dark comedy."

The author's notes on “The Police" give '

a good introduction to all the plays, "This
play does not contain anything except
what it actually contains. This means that
it is not an allusion to anything, it is not a
metaphor and it should not be read as
such. The most important thing is to pre
sent the naked text as exactly as possible
with a lairly underlined sense of logic in
opinions and scenes. The play will demand
intense concentration on the part of the au
dience because of its structural compact»
ness.“

One oi the plays, "Out at Sea," was
presented here last year. Czechowski
justiiied producing it again so soon by in
dicating that last year it was "used on a
dilierent level." last time me play was
presented as a directing class project and
not many people saw it Also, the three
plays work welL together in that they
“show differences in Mrozek‘s style."

Work on the plays began live weeks ago,
Auditions for the plays were held the first
and second days of this semester and
rehearsals started a week later. Although
this is a somewhat tight schedule, it Is
workable because short onenacts don't
take as long to rehearse as a full length
play.

Czechowski also noted that the plays
pose some special challenges tor both the
directors and the actors. For the actors.
there is the problem of dealing with dark
humor as well as playing unreal situations
as real. Plus, the actors have to deal with
issues with which they have had no direct

contact Consequently their interpreta-
tions will be difterent than those of actors
who have dealt with these situations. For
the directors. “keeping it under control"
becomes a challenge. There is a tendancy
to overplay and stereotype characters.
Therefore. the directors must work to keep
the interpretation from becoming farcical
and slapstick.
