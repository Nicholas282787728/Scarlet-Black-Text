There is more

by Barb Little

To most Grinnelllans, the Amana Col»
miles are a place to get good, simple,
wholesome road; a place to go on a Satur-
day evening when menu hotline doesn't
stimulate the appetite, or when payday
makes possible a splurge on a meal that is
expensive by Longhorn standards, but
cheap considering the delightful array oi
iood that is replenished upon request,
What else could the Amana: be but a
iamilystyle “pigout” served in a relaxed
atmosphere reminiscent of home?

There actually is more to the Amanas
and uniortunately many people iail to cone
sider the colonies as anything more than a
cluster of restaurants, Many who do
recognize the Amanas as a community,
see it through distorted glass. Since the
Amana Society is basically a devout
religious group, people commonly equate
their lifestyle with that of the strict Amish
who believe the attributes of modern life to
be a Sin. Automobiles, televisions, ex-
cessive travel and further education, for
example, are unheard of in the Amish sect.
Not so for the Amana people. They are
simply a society oi citizens living together
in utopian iashion, desiring a simple way
or living and bound together by their com-
mon heritage and religious faith. Outward-
ly, they are the same as any other people.

The people who would eventually
become the Amana Society had their roots
in the German mystics and pietlsts oi the
early 1700s. Throughout Northern Europe
at this time, small religious sects were
formed in remllion against the rituals and
intellectual theology oi the Lutheran
Church. One such sect, called the Coma
munity of True Inspiration, later became
the Amana Society.

This group was severely persecuted in
Germany and in 1842 Christian Metz, one
of the inspired leaders, or WERKZEUGE,
sailed for America to find a home for the
oppresed community, The group settled
not far from Bufialo and founded the
Ebenezer Society All property was held in
common and the group established com»

elethon callers

by Ellen Heath

Ski Vail! Wondering what all those
posters around campus are for? Well this
year the Annual Fund Telethon Committee
is offering an expense-paid week’s stay in
a condominium in Vail, 0010., as the grand
prize for the four-person telethon team
that brings in the most pledges.

Bruce Crane, ’30, has donated the use oi
his family's condominium for the last
week of‘ winter break. According to Scott
Ross, one of the telethon’s student
organizers, Crane is providing this incen—
tive because he enjoyed calling tor the
telethon here two years ago. SGA will
sponsor the Vail trip with $500 that Joint
Board voted toward the telethon. A college
van will be provided ior transportation to
Vail. The winning team must come back to
Grinnell and drive the van from here.

The fall session of the telemon, which is
held twice each year, takes place during
the week of Nov. 7 to 13. Participants call
Grinnell alumni to request pledges which
help to cover the college's operating ex-
penses, iinancial aid, professors’ salaries
and the SGA Student Activity Fund,
among other things. The Telethon Com-
mittee stressed the money raised does not
go into the college's endowment.

Students who are interested in calling
tor the telethon should organize groups oi
four to participate in two of the sessions.
The Committee developed a graduated
point system to determine the prize win-
ners. Each person will receive points tor
the number of pledges he or she brings in,
but obtaining a pledge from a new donor is
worth more points than securing a dona-
tion irom someone who has given before.
At the end oi each evening, the points from
all four team members will be added
together to determine the winning team
ior that night, and ultimately ior the entire
telethon.

The Second place team {or all sessions
will win a dinner at the restaurant of its
choice, Nightly winners will get the tradi-
tional dinners for two at JD’s or The

to the Amanas than food

munal farms and factories.

The community prospered and soon
needed to exand. The real estate around
Buiialo became expensive as a result of
urban growth and the community turned
westward. in November of 1354, a commitv
tee oi four purchased 26,000 acres along
the Iowa River with the water power, rich
soil, timber, sandstone, limestone and clay
for the brick necessary to establish a new
community.

Amana, the first village, was laid out in
loss, iollowed gradually by the six other
villages: Middle Amana, High Amana,
East Amana, West Amana, South Amana
and Homestead. Each village was self-
sufficient, containing iarm buildings, a
church, a school and the necessary i
dustries to maintain the villages. The i
dustries from Ebenezer werereestablishr
ed and included cabinetrmaking, wagon
shops, woolen mills, ilour milling and
calico printing. All property was still held
in common and families were assigned to
living quarters in the society owned
houses. Religious liie was the strong unify-
ing factor and the lnspirationists held ser-
vices 11 times a week,

By the late 19205, the inﬂuences of im-
proved communications and die depres-
sion made isolated communal living
economically and socially impossible. In
1932, the Inspirationists voted to incur
porate their holdings; stock was issued tor
a profitrsharing Amana Society and a
private enterprise was established, with
the Amana Church Society continuing as
the religious foundation.

Despite “the change,” as the incorpora-
tion is known, the physical appearance is
much the same as any American com-
munity, except that it is much cleaner and
seemingly more relaxed. ilomcs subtly
reveal the wealth invested in them, but the
newer housing is not essentially different
in design of Consﬂuclion than any modern
housmg development '

The lifestyle of the Amanas today is
radically diiierent than it was iiity years

Oakroom and there will be $20 dimers for
top callers. Participants are allowed the
usual free 10~minute phone Call within the
United States. They’ll also receive telethon
T-shirts with this year’s logo: cartoon
characters Inga and Hubert, represen-
tatives for the Vail trip.

The iinal sission will feature a piayoii
between teams. Each team will choose its
best caller and those 20 will compete for
the most pledges. Who ever wins this com»
petition will also gain the pledge points oi
the Telethon Committee members who ex-
pect they will be making some calls of
their own during the week. Thus, each
team has an additional chance to win the
trip to Vail. Aside from Ross, the commit-
tee includes Chris Murner and Amy Wolff.
Library employee Paula Schwery is the
artist tor the publicity campaign.

To gauge the teams’ standings each
night, the committee plans to build a paper
mache mountain complete with pine trees
to stand in the center oi North Lounge.
Team Standings will be represented by
miniature skiers stationed on the moun-
tain. Groups with more points will be
nearer to the summit than the others. Ross
said the mountain will help to generate en,
thusiasm by reminding the callers of the
prize they could win. “We’re going to turn
North Lounge into a ski resort,” Ross
claimed. “It‘s going to be fun this yar.”

Money tor the student Activity Rind will
be solicited only from members of the
classes of '80 and ’81. Class fund directors
Anne Woodley, 'w, and Leslie Taylor, '31,
will send letters to those alumni to remind
them that they will be called and to tell
them of the Vail trip. The Development Of-
fice staff will write to the other alumni to
inform them of the telethon.

To sign up, a team of students should call

ago. its cultural complex is very similar to
that oi the outside population oi Iowa
County. The use oi the German language,
the one strong tie to the “old way.“ has
become much less prevalent and the older
and middleraged citizens are almost the
only members who speak it. Church ser-
vices, now held once a week, are still
however, offered both in German and
English. Some things just cannot be
altered.

Another change was the demise of their
adherence to nonviolence and the cessar
tion oi conscientious obJection to military
service During the Civil War, the society
was able to purchase replacements tor
drafted members; during World War l and
ll, youlh were drafted but served as
medical aides and occupied other noncom»
bat positions, During the Korean Conﬂict.
Amana men served in combat, as they did
in via Nam, thus creating another very

obvious similarity between Amana and
nonrAmana people.

The basic change in social values is not
as easily observable. Possibly one of the
most obvious changes has been the deci-
sion to appeal to the outside tourist trade,
after spending many decades in an at-
tempt to discourage it. The old concept of
isolation and of avoiding worldly men has
broken down, and today the community
warmly welcomes the outsider, The old
system oi denial and separateness irom
the world no longer exists The Amana
residents have ielt the impact or com-
petitiveness oi the capitalistic system
which is obvious from the size and value 0‘
their well-kept homes and the size and
number at automobiles in their driveways
Children now attend exclusive private col-
leges (one graduated from Grinnell' no:
long ago) in addition to state institutions
