Iowa College “utterly and entirely wiped out”

 

 

 

Iowa College in 1872.

by Ellen Heath

“It entered Grinnell from the west.
swept a narrow semicircular route.
destroying everything in its path, in-
cluding the two college buildings. . , "

The above quote is irom Grinnell: A Cen-
tury oi progress, published by the Grinnell
lleraldhegister. June 17 of this year is the

moth anniversary of the cyclone that tore .

through Iowa, destroying much of Grinnell
and college, then known as lowa College.
After the twister struck, The Grinnell
Herald printed accounts of the tornado and
the damage it caused. Later, survivors of
the storm wrote their memories of the
night, Many of those accounts told of what
happened at the college.

One survivor, Katherine A. Jones, a
young woman at the time, wrote, “I see yet
,the beautyofthe campus aswecameaway
from the buildings at noon. Everything
was in commencement order. . . " (Com»
mencement was scheduled only 10 days
after the cyclone hit.) “At night we were
sent home (from choir practice} without a
rehearsal because the clouds were so
threatening. Very remarkable clouds they
were. . . The western heavens were aglow
with the most wonderful greens and
yellows. Soon the rain began to fall. , , it
came in torrents. . . Presently there Came
a roar, like something different to each
person and like no thing one had ever
heard before but something one was never
to forget."

Most accounts say the tornado lasted or
stayed in Grinnell no more than five

minutes. When it had gone the town churn ~

ches began to ring their bells. Jones, who
escaped the storm in a cellar, called to son
meone walking in the street to ask the
meaning oi the bells. ”The college
buildings are down and all the boys in
them,” the man answered.

The Herald published on June us, 1332
reported that, “The cyclone struck the Cole
lege with terrific force The stone building
was unroofed and blown down to the Se»
cnnd story and part of the walls were car-

, ried away. The brick building went into a
disorganized mass. The destruction could
not have been more complete,”

Iowa College, in 1882,, had only -two

otherwise more would have been in the
ruins of“ both colleges."

Harry Downer, an Iowa College
graduate of 1882, remembered in his
manuscript, “Speaking of Old Grinnell,"
that, “The work of salvage went on with
boniira. Center College lit up in one car
her when Professor’s stock of phosphorous
spontaneously burst into flames.” The
Herald of June 18, 1882 said of the fire,
“After two hours work with the buckets
and three Babcock extinguishers the fire
was so far under way that it was left
alone.” The college libraries, museum,
mineralogical work rooms and science
equipment were almost all lost.

is, Grinnell, founder ct lowa College,
campaigned in Chicago and the East for
funds to restore the college. Chicago
businessmen donated generously and a
building called Chicago Hall was erected
on the old site of West College. Blair Hall
was built where Center College had been
and Alumni Hall was built east of Blair.

buildings; West College, on the site of the
present Fine Am Building and Center Col-
lege, near the site oi Burling Library. A
third building, east of Center College had
burned the previous year and the senior
class was planning to rebuild it,

Two college students died as a result of
the cyclone. One had been in his room on
the top floor of West College and the other
had run out into the storm from Center Col-
lege. Ettie Robbins, a student at the Col-
lege, described the aitermath in a letter a
few days after the tornado, “The most
solemnly dreadful thing you can imagine
was when, all having been taken out, the
command for silence was given, that the
faintest call from under the ruins might be
heard. Not a sound was heard in all that
crowd and then (the president) stood up
and called the roll oi the boys rooming in
the buildings. They either responded to
their names or were accounted for in some
way." Jones remembered. “It was good
iortune that the boys had a ball game in
Tama that day and had not yet returned,

The college also built Goodnow about this
time.

Many oi the newspaper stories and per»
sonal accounts stress that although the col»
lege buildings were destroyed, the spirit of
the school was still intact. Robbins ex»
plained in her letter, “The routine of col-
lege life was not blown away by the tor»
nado. The graduation exercises were held
in the big church as usual. The Herald of
June 20, 1882, stated, “The faculty have
decided that the college year must end so
far as possible with the usual routine.
Chapel is to be held at Methodist Church
Recitations and examinations are to some
extent resumed and it's announced ﬂ’iat
commencement exercises will be as
previously planned."

The faculty sent a letter to the'students
to tell them of its plans and give
reassurance. The letter explained, ”New
and finer apparatus is to be at once pure
chased with insurance on the old. . . " it
also mentioned the gifts made to the
school, “Not a day has passed since. . .
some hearts have not opened to volunteer
aid tor the rebuilding." _

.The faculty closed its letter with the
statement that, “We are authorized to say
that by new arrangements, board and
room by the week will not cost more than
last year, perhaps less."

Downer and a classmate went to towns
in Minnesota to solicit donations to aid
lowa College. In his manuscript, Downer
tells how, “The railroads charged no
freight and carload after carload headed
for Grinnell from the generous mills in
Minnesota and Wisconsin."

A pamphletentitled, “Chicago, Iowa and
Grinnell: A Study of Great Disasters,"
said, "Grinnell is probably the only college
that has ever been put on the map and
given a running start toward fame by he»
lng wiped out 7 utterly and entirely wiped
out "

Professor of History David Jordan, will
publish an article about the cyclone and its
impact on the city oi Grinnell and the col-
lege, “The Night of the Terrible Twister,"
in the spring issue of the lowan. The jour-
nal is due to come out next week.
