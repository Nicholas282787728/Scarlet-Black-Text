Faculty discusses Buffer Days.

by John Hanson

Debate over academic pressure and the
need for buffer days surfaced once again
during last Friday's faculty meeting. No
motions were passed nor were any other
actions taken concerning the topic, both
sides were allowed to air their views.

Jane Brown, representing a student
group supporting buffer days, and Dean
Catherine Frazer, speaking on behalf of
the Committee on Academic Standing,
both focused their dlscussmns on the cur
rent Calendar of the college

Dean Frazer felt that any change in the
current calendar would not be construe
tive She stressed that the committee was
willing to review current guidelines and
alternatives, but that it is also necessary to
“give the calendar a full year trial.”

Brown, on the other hand, claimed that
“the present calendar only served to ex»

acerbate our problem. ” Favoring the need
for more study time before finals and urg-
ing some immediate change, Brown and
her group put forth several proposals:
Shorten New Student Days and use the ex»
tra days for buffer days, add one extra day
in the spring, create a moratorium date for
papers, (This would mean all student
papers would have to be completed by a
certain date before the week of finals.)
Faculty reaction seemed to be mixed,
some did feel, however, that the idea of a
moratorium date would eliminate the
possibility for extensions, which in itself
could create unwanted pressure.
Associate Dean of Student Affairs
FlosSle Mitchell presented some figures
showing that more students feel there is an
increased atmosphere of pressure. At this
time last year only 13 students had applied

for leaves of absence, while this year’s
number is 25. “We sense that there is a
tremendous amount of pressure this year
but do not know just how much is
academic," added Mitchell.

The faculty also discussed a report sub
mitted by the Curriculum Council on the
possibility of a critical languages pres
gram,

This program would not replace any of
the languages currently being taught but
would, rather. offer an opportunity for
students to teach themselves a language
that might complement their field of
study, or be used as preparation for an off-
Campus program. A director would be
hired by the college to oversee the pro-
gram as a whole and to work with tutors in
the various languages.

At this time, five languages, Hebrew,

JB overrules allocation for
finals week films

by Laura McDermith

Joint Board overruled the Initiative
Fund Committee’s allocation of $150 to
Karl Dukstein for a Christmas film to be
shown during finals week, Mark Brads
shaw, SGA vice president, told .713 that he
thought that the lFC had misallocated the
funds,

Bradshaw’s reasons for believing that
IFC misallocated the funds were that nor
mal channels for requesting films were igr
nored (specifically, Ruth Katz, films
chairperson, was not contacted), and ex
tra expenses would be incurred for shipp
ing costs because of the late order date.

According to Katz, she “just happened to
he in the SGA office when she hear "
about Dukstein’s request for money for a
film to be shown during finals week. Kat:
had not been contacted. She said, “He

[Dukstein] Should have come to me: if i
had said ‘no,’ then he could have gone
around the committee.” Katz stated that
she decided not to show a film during finals
week because the projectionists were
against working at that time.

Dukstein represents a recently formed
film society of about 15 people. The group
was formed to “bring in a little diversity”
to campus films, according to Dukstein,
The group would like to show artistic,
historical, silent and student films and
possibly bring in speakers to talk about
films. Dukstein said he talked to Georgia
Dentel, performing programs and ac-
tivities counselor, and gained her support
for a film to be shown during finals.

Dentel, according to Dukstein, often ar-
ranges and schedules films that groups

Trusfee Venture Fund

to allow more

by Terri Porter

With one of the highest endowments in
the country for an institution of its type,
Grinnell College is faced with the question
of where to funnel the extra monies.

The idea of a Trustees’ Venture md
emerged a year ago with a substantial in—
crease in the college endowment from the
sale of a college-owned television station in

7 Dayton. Ohio.

' The sale netted Grinnell $37 million —
almost doubling the endowment at the
time. With this sudden influx of funds
came the question of how to use the extra
money to make Grinnell 3 better college,
according to President George Drake.

In considering the question, the Board of
Trustees asked President Drake to look at
colleges similar to Grinnell, but with
larger endowments, in order to determine
what percentage of their annual budget is
covered by this type of income based on
stocks, bonds, businesses and other such
sources.

Drake found that, on the average. en—
dowment is the basis for 20 percent of their
budgets, Since this percentage coincides
with Grinnell’s 21 or 22 percent from en-
dowment, me trustees concluded that
Grinnell's endowment is already paying
for a good percentage of the costs of the
college.

Rather than increase the percentage of
the endowments towards college costs or

programs

put the money to immediate use in area
such as renovations, new library books or
higher faculty and stall salaries, the
Board of Trustees proposed an additional
fund, the Venture Fund, whose monies are
to be taken from the endowment.

This fund, according to Drake, is for pro-
grams that would make significant im-
provements within the college and call at-
tention to the college.

Two proposals have already been ap-
proved. One is for a Eastern European
course next year which would include a
tour of Russia. The other plan involves ex-
pauding the computer program. Drake
stated that their goal is to have the
strongest program in this area for a col-
lege of Grinnell's status. The computer
program was awarded approximately $2
million over the next four years and the
Eastern European program will get
$26,000.

Since the 'l‘rustees’ Venture Fund is a
new concept, it still needs some
refinements. A spending ceiling and
guidelines for the proposals are among
areas to be discussed. As Drake noted,
“After having approved a couple of pro»
jects, the board wants to take another look
into the idea," The issue will be discussed
completely at the February trustees'
meeting.

 

ask for outside of the Films Committee. He
named the Concerned Black Students,
New Student Days Committee and the In-
ternational student Group as groups that
order films without going through the
Films Committee, Dukstein said that he
did not go to Kat: because he had heard
that she was against showing a film during
finals week.

The film society decided that finals week
was a great time to get started setting up
films. According to Dukstein, several peo-
ple had expressed regret that finals week
was without films for the first time that
they could remember. It was decided that
a Bing Crosby/Fred Astaire movie and
some cartoons would be a nice tension
reliever for finals.

Dukstein asked for the $150 from IFC to,

cover all the costs of showing the films.

Bradshaw made the motion to overrule
IFC’s decision to allocate the $150 to the
film society. Eric Secoy, ch chairperson,
did not attend the meeting. The motion
passed unanimously after Bradshaw
presented his arguments against giving
the group the money.

Dukstein said, “W 5 funny that they
brought it up without even asking me to the
meeting." Dukstein was contacted by the
5&8 after the JB meeting. Dukstein coma
merited, “I think the decision to overrule
IFC's alloation is really petty and
ridiculous; I think the whole thing is silly.“

in order to vote on Bradshaw's motion,
another motion to suspend the rules was
made and passed, The bylaws state that
new business cannot be voted on until the
meeting after the one during which a mo-
tion has been made. This measure was
designed in order to give people time to ex
press their opinions to their represen-
tative. Since this is the last meeting of this
Joint Board, they could not put it off until
the next meeting.

Bradshaw’s motion was the only new
business. During the cabinet reports Stu-
dent Coordinator Jon scharrf said that the

ltalian, Japanese, Polish and Serbo-
Croatian, have been frequently suggested
for possible study by members of the col-
lege community. If such a program is
established, the actual languages to be
taught would be decided by a subcommitr
tee of the Curriculum Committee.

The faculty moved to have the idea tabl-
ed until further research could be done to
iron out a few problems brought up by the
faculty, such as administration of the pro
gram and how credits might be awarded.

In a quick, almost unanimous vote. the
faculty approved a motion to send an in—
vltation to distinguished economist John
Kenneth Galbraith to speak at commencer

Shuttle: service
sometimes takes
rocky road

by Karyn Reif

with winter break rapidly approaching,
the student Coordinator's office is once
again selling shuttle tickets for transportaa
tion to and from Grinnell in December and
January. in addition to the usual shuttles
to Des Moines and Chicago, SGA hopes to
send buses to Kansas City and Minneapolis
over break,

Assistant Student Coordinator Tracy
Wold stated that SGA “will send a bus
anywhere, as long as there are enough peo-
ple to offset the cost.” Vans are often sent
to lowa City for exams such as the LSAT
and the GRE. (A shuttle wil be leaving for
the GRE tomorrow.) Also, the student
Coordinator‘s office has sent “fun
shuttles" to Iowa City on weekend even»
ings.

There is rarely any problem sending
shuttles to Des Moines, since SGA general-
ly does not need to rent buses and drivers.
College vans are driven by students, and,
in the event that there are enough studenls
signed up, a local school bus can be used.

The problems arise with buses going to
other cities. Because any other destination
involves a much longer drive, soil will not
send student drivers, and school buses are
too uncomfortable for any long period of
time.

Therefore, buses must be rented from
the Marshalltown bus company. These
buses are quite expensive, according to
Wold, and seat either 39 or 47 passengers.
Although SGA is willing to operate shuttles
with some financial loss, at least 28 people
must be signed up in order to minimize this
loss.

Student Coordinator John Scharlf an-
nounced at Wednesday’s Joint Board
meeting that insufficient interest would
probably lead to the cancellation of the
Kansas City and Minneapolis shuttles.

Since there are a large number of people
who either live in or ﬂy out of the Chicago
area, the buses to and from Chicago often
fill up quickly. (in several occasions there
have been enough people to require a sec
cond bus,

There have been problems that involve

:ohanging the_ size of buses and vans
ordered. Also, finals week is too hectic for

SGA to sell tickets. Prices are: to Des
Moines $8 one way, 516 round trip, to
Chicago $23 one-way, 343 round trip; to
Kansas City or Minneapolis $23 one-way,
$43 round trip.
