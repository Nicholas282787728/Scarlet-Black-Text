Haines to reopen on schedule next semester
Student fears allayed '

by Brad Vander Linden

The Haines Hall Renovation is on
schedule and students will be moved into
the hall at the beginning oi second
semester, according to Jim Tederman,
dean of Student Affairs. Anxious residents
had been worried that one of the Haines
Alternate Houses located on Park Street
would have to move early during finals
week because the space was needed to
house international students over the
winter break

“We had been asking some people
(whether or not they would Consider move
ing in before the end of the semester) but
were not requiring any studens to move”
during finals week said Tederman in a
phone interview.

Haines residents had been worried for
the past few weeks about an ad-
ministrative decision that would have re—
quired some of them to move during the
final exam week. Tederman put to rest any
fears that some of the students would be
moved involuntarily during the tense final
week before winter break. instead,
students will be moved into the newly
renovated Haines Hall at the beginning of
second semester.

“I hope it doesn't interfere with finals,”
moaned sophomore Brian white of 1217
Park. “I don't think we should have to
move all our books and furniture. it should
be the school‘s responsibility to move us
entirely.”

In fact many students who signed up to

Stress symposium '
Saturday

While there will not be any extra bufr
fer days to help alleviate pressure
around finals time until at least 1984,
Mortar Board is doing its part to help
by sponsoring a symposium on stress
and how to relieve it tomorrow at i pm.
in Main Lounge.

Coordinated by Babe Voertman and
John Gazewood. the symposium will
feature members of the Grinnell Men-
tal Health Center and the campus
Health Center stair films, discussions,
a oneaact play by John Kerr and a

served.

Student voters”
names released

Reprinted from the Grinnell lleralda
Register

The publishers of the Brooklyn Paper
last week devoted more than 52 column
inches of space to the names of Grinnell
College students who registered and
voted in Grinnell’s first ward.

Chuck Dunhani contended in an in
troduction to the names that the ap
proximately 390 students who voted on
Nov. 2 were instrumental in the victory
of Rep, Janet Carl (D-Grinnelll in the
state's 53rd House District race.

Dunham said that the turnout was
larger than usual and that “the tally in
Grinnell Ward l indicateis) the
students did in fact decide the outcome
of die Tyrrell-Carl race for state
representative.”

A recount, which had been requested
by Phil Tyrrell tit-North English),
showed that Carl won by 49 votes,

Remarked Dunham: “Most of the
college students voted in Ward 1, and
Carl got 543 votes there to Tyrrell’s 22&
Almost all of the students have perma-
nent addresses outside of Iowa, and a
mere handful live in Poweshiek County
year-round."

Dunham made no assertion as to how
many of die students might have voted

for Tyrrell.

live off~campus during the renovation
period are new content living in college
owned housing and lament that they now
have to be uprooted and moved across
campus in the cold of late January

“I think the Haines renovation is a good
thing, but i now prefer by far living in a
house,” said Al Abrams. ”I would definite-
1y opt for a house, and i think most Haine-
sians would too alter living in the Park
Street houses for a semester.” added the
disgruntled Abrams.

In fact. most students seem to prefer live
ing in the Park Street houses and are
unhappy about having to move again.
Todd “Death'” Oberman, who is com»
pleting his linal year at Grinnell, was
adamnent in his desire to remain in the
houses the second semester.

“I like my room a lot, and don't want to
move," said the jovial Oberman at what
was turning out to be a successful all-
campus slumber party in m7 Park.

A group of student musicians have band-
ed together to form a cooperative centered
on playing and practicing together in one
of the houses. Becky Heckman and Tony
Gatto, coordinators of the proposal, are ex
cited about their idea, Their idea is novel,
and they think it would merit special con-
sideration.

Tederman said the administration is
“saying no right now about die proposal,"
but that nothing definite has been decided
and if certain ideas merit consideration.
they will be evaluated,

Tederman said once Vacated, the houses
would most likely be converted into office

space or remodeled into apartments for
faculty members.

“We haven’t made any definite plans,
but some of the new space will be used by
the music department as additional praca
lice rooms," remarked Tederman.

Pass/fail letter

by Jenny Phibbs

Approval oi a pass/fail deadline letter
held center stage at Wednesday's Joint
Board meeting.

The letter, introduced for the second
time by Non-College Owned Housing
Representative Michaelene Kelly, re
quested that the Committee on Academic
Standing reconsider the deadline for a
course to be changed to a pass/fail grading
basis.

The letter states, ”We are not now ad—
vocating a change in the deadlines concer—
ning dropping a course, but rather we ask
for a reconsideration of the deadline for a
course being changed to a pass/fail grade
in light of these new rules." These new
rules are the changed deadlines for dropp-
ing a course and the introduction of the
“F” grade this semester.

The letter asks for the pass/fall decision
in a course to be extended approximately
eight weeks into the semester. The current
deadline is three weeks. Theoretically this
would give students the necessary time to
judge the course and their work in it. A ra-
tional decision about the overall‘ quality of
the course could then be made by the 5m,

An undetermined number of students
have committed fraud by illegal use of the
college's new phone system.

Apparently the parties involved were
able to break through the computer code
and dial direct calls which were ultimately
charged to the college, Jim Tederman,
vice president and dean of Student Affairs,
believes that students possibly broke
through by dialing eight and then im~
mediately dialing the outside number,

The length of time this has been going on
and the amount of moliey involved is still
unknown, Tederman said, “We don't know
what we’re up against in terms of the
amount of Calls involved.”

The college will not be liable (or pay-
ment oi the phone calls

The current investigation by the phone
company security officer should reveal the
identity of the criminals. The college has
left the means of punishment in the hands
of the phone company, which could press
charges ior fraud

The maximum penalty for lraud is :1, one
or one year in prison

Tederman urged any students involved
in the incident to contact the phone com-
pany and plead for mercy,” since the col-

lege will not act as a buffer between the
two parties.

“The phone company should proceed
against the students as it would against
anyone involved in fraud,” stated Tederr
man.

The college was concerned about die
possibility of fraud from the initial ins
stallation of the phone system on campus.
A difficulty exists in designing a phone
system which will give students direct ac-
cess to off-campus lines and also remain
foolproof.

The phone lraud was the cause of the in»
ability of students to get an off- -campus line
over Thanksgiving weekend But the
phone ‘system returned to normal last
Mondav

Until the persons involved have been
discovered. little more can be revealed
about the situation. In the meantime, the
system must be reprogrammed to prevent
such a problem in the tutors.

The telephone switching gear, which
determines what the college can do with its

~ phone system, must be changed. Presently

a close watch is being kept on the phones,
making traud nearly impossible.

sparks SGA debate

After Kelly read the proposed letter SGA
VicerPresident Mark Bradshaw asked if
she and an assigned committee would be
willing to negotiate the issue with the
faculty. Bradshaw went on to say that he
had talked with Dean Frazer about chang-
ing the deadline, and she had appeared
receptive to the suggestion of a formal
discussion with a select Joint Board com-
mittee.

Kelly replied that she had urged the
Committee on Academic Standing to cons
sider the letter. She felt a letter was the
most effective means to express the Joint
Board‘s views on extending the options for
a pass/fail grade, Continuing his opposi-
tion to Kelly’s proposal, Bradshaw stated

. that the idea of sending a letter had the

“shades of last year" attached to it, He
was referring to the letter sent by Joint
Board\t_o Frazer asking for the deans

resignation.

A vote for the approval of the proposed
letter was then taken it passed by only a
slight margin; and the question of whether
or not die letter accurately represented
die views of Joint Board was raised From
this question arose an unstructured debate
over the function of Joint Board.

The debate ' on the letter continued,
climaxing with SGA Administrative Assis-
tant Marilyn Zielinski‘s exclamation, “I
don’t think we represent ourselves! ” With
this somber note a motion was made to
reconsider the pass/fail letter. Kelly
stressed the fact that this was the second
time she had shown the letter to the board
and that she had been willing to discuss the
letter at anytime before the meeting. A
vote was taken and the proposed letter was
allowed to be sent to the Committee on
Academic Standing.

In odier business, the board approved
the Finance Committee's funding request
of 5142,25 for the Waltz and $270 for Mortar
Board lectures. The new bylaw requiring
hall representatives to write an SGA note
to their hall residents each week was reaps
proved without discussion.

Kelly and fellow OffaCampus Represene '
tatlve John Walter presented a finished
copy of a guide to the SGA they eventually
plan to give to each student. The booklet
explains the functions of the SGA, and it is
intended to keep students more informed
about their government on campus. Until
final approval by Joint Board, the single
copy will be on reserve in Burling Library.
