Burling: The empty edifice

by Kenneth Forrester

College publications oiten mention the
$3.5 million renovan‘bn project just com-
plated on Burling Library and the
resulting doubling of capacity but the
publications don‘t mention number of
volumes on the half-empty shelves.

And. it is rarely mentioned that the col-
lege ranks 23rd out of 26 schools studied
after receiving grants from the Sloane
Foundation.

The library can now hold 525.000
volumes. However. as of July 1, 1984. it had
only 275,000 volumes. This ligure includes
works like Man and the Motor Car by
Albert W. Whitney, a 1935 best book aimed
at use in high school driver education
classes, and the “Report of the State Mine
,lnspector,” for the state ot lowa,
December 31. 1931.

This and a recent report comparing
Grinnell’s library to those at 25 other col»
leges across the country helps point out
glaring inadequacies in Burling Library

Christopher McKee. head librarian at
Grinnell, compared the data irom 25 of the
colleges that received Sloane Grants dur-

ing the 1933/34 school year. The colleges in
the report included Bryn Mawr, Carleton,
Franklin 8; Marshall, Oberlin. and Swar-
thmore.

Although Burling's budget — which in.
cludes books, periodicals. recordings, and
rebindings 7 is being raised substantially.
there is some question as to whether it is
enough.

The budget, which jumped from $292,000
in 1983-34 to approximately $333,000 this
year. is being raised to $374,000 [or next
year. Although this will improve the col-
lege’s rankings of 23rd for total expen-
ditures for library materials. it will not be
enough to make any signiﬁcant jumps in
the amount of resources available.

McKee said that the library's plan is to
keep abreast on current materials, and to
slowly catch up on other materials. Most
people use materials from the last 10 years
or so and in that area Burling is upswsdate.
he said.

Another area where Burllng is lagging

behind is in periodicals,
Burling is 25th in expenditures for

periodicals and 24th tor the number oi c
rent periodical subscriptions. McKee s
he does think we should have at leastn c
ple oi hundred more subscriptions.

pointed out that the library added 9:. n
subscriptions since July. He expects t .
ten to twenty more subscriptions this'ye

One category where Grinnell did 1-.
more iavorably was with expenditure i
student, where they were 12th out at iii
schools compared. McKee said that as
library presently stands, it could serv
college of 1800 students as well as it ser
one oi 1200. '

McKee said he would not want
budget to be raised too last. It would p
bably result in a lot of money the
wasted, he said. ‘

He saw a lot of money wasted on rat
expenditures while working at a , st
university during the 1560’s.

McKee added that even with ihistlat
increase in acquisitions. he is going
have a lot or quality control. The roci'is
be on quality more than quantity, he s.
