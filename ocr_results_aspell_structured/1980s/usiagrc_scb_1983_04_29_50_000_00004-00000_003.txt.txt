 

Genuine “Hoe - Down”

i Plow Boys

;

Grinnell students will get a chance to
witness perhaps the concert event or the
year this weekend. The Public Events
Committee has somehow managed to book
the Warren County Plow Devils. The
Devils (as their tans anectionately call
them) hail lrom Rotation Crop. Iowa and
have already given concerts in Davenport,
Sioux city, and far-away Kearney, Neb.

The Devils have one very unique
feature: according to the group's manager
Clem Fritzman, "We use the instruments
which are found only in Coast to Coast
stores." Their "sound" ranges from the
meaty tones of various garden implements
to the delicate vibrations of a nail punch
and a 3/16 inch Socket wrench.

Their hit repetoire includes such lowa
tavorites as "Here's Mud in Your Ear,"
"Born to Seed Corn” and “What, Rocky
Mountain Oysters Againt "

Despite their obvious high quality, Con-
cert Chairperson Daniel Klatz is mined "I
thought we were getting the Warren Coun-
ty Punk DeVils, Now The Punk Devils are
hot!” stated an exasperated Klatz,

Klatz iurther explained, “I s'pose you
could call these guys ah. . earthy, but
they're not hot. Maybe if ive give them a
set of drums, they'll become hot like the
Shakin' Pyramids.”

However, Bill Deminon says that “these
young men have entertained farmers from
Spencer to Spirit Lake. We shouldn’t look a
giit horse in the mouth even it we aren't
the oldest college west of the Mississippi."

Deminoff also pointed out that The
Wallace Farmer had the following praise
of The Devils in their Pesticide issue: "A
tape recording of the Warren County Plow
Devils will turn a day ofchisel plowmg into
child's play,”

Delnlnoff, in his continuous effort to get
as much mileage out of viSiting groups as
is possible, has also scheduled the Devils
to give a lawn and garden show. “Each
student must bring his or her own
geranium plant to the demonstration,"
Deminoff insisted,

The Devils will be giving two perfor»
mances at 7 and 9 pm, on Friday night
in the Souﬂ'l Lounge. Shoe scrapers will be
provided freesof-charge as you exit lrom
the concert,

Klatz Bricks North Lounge

"Have I ever been wrong? No way baby,
and let me tell ya, this guy is HOT!”

Strong words like these were used by
Concerts Chair Dan Klalz to describe the
periormer in North Lounge tonight. “Dan
Klatz does the greatest hits of Dan Klatz,"
exclaimed Klatz. “You can't beat this guy
for sheer excitement!”

Klatz said that he would be doing solo
renditions of hits by Eddie Clearwater,
-- lood" ulmer, The Suburbs, The in
dividuals, The Shakin' Pyramids and
many other groups who have appeared
under his auspices. He indicated that
several selections by Sleepy LaBeei‘ might
be performed as an encore,

Due to an ailcampus twister competis
tion, Klatz was unable to periorm in Darby
Gym and settled for .North Lounge. He
maintained, however, that the acoustics
and ambience are better in the cozy
Forum setting,

“People don't sweat enough in Darby
anyway," said the man called “Fred." "I
kind oi get into the way people slam into
each other in North Lounge. it really gets
the place hot, Totally HOT."

Klatz commented on how he was able to
book himself on the Short notice OI [our
days. “Well, it wasn't easy If I had booked
myself a couple of weeks ago I could have
gotten me for only $500. But I kind of
waited around too long, and I ended up
costing myself over 32,300. i know that's a
lot of money, but I really think that I'm
worth it. I'm HOT."

The concert will get underway at about
10 pm. “Or whenever l'm damn good and
ready," said Klatz, The concert will end
“over my dead body," or around 3 pm. on
Saturday, whichever comes first.

Bring a friend to the show. This guy is
HOT.

Superman
Representative of the Nietzchian ideal of
the ubermensch, Superman brings to the
screen many of the radical doctrines of the
postmodern philosophical movement.

The movie commences with the
Kierkegaardian “leap of faith” as Marlon
Brando stares into the abyss of his Own life
— lost in an existential depression

The movie moves into Kafkatype im-
agery as a young baby metamorphoses
from an alien to a symbol of overextended
justice in the world.

There is no exit for the main character
7 as Sartre would have it he is trapped by
the burden of being the same as mankind,
yet somehow not the same at all.

Reminiscent oi Camus, Superman
emerges as a true “stranger," banished
from the human world and sentenced to a
lifetime of estrangement on another
planet.

Mary Poppins

One must avoid looking at Mary Poppins
through Jungian blinders it is obviously a
relationship between a women who has
spent many years on an analyst's couch
and two children caught in the throes of an
Oedlpal and Electra complex.

The scene in which all the nannies are
blown away as Mary Poppins enters the
household symbolizes the secret desire of
children to kill their nannies

The song ”A Spoonful of Sugar" is Clear-
ly indicative of an oral fixation, vmile
Supercalifragilisticexpialldocious is clear-
ly a reference to a women‘s desire tor an
oversized phallus. lNotlce that the scene is
dominated by men, yet it is a woman who
actually sings the song.)

In the end, the children's complexes
become too strong, and Mary Poppins
herself is Victimized by their secret desire
to kill nannies, leaving the children all
alone with their parents to iultill every fan-
tasy or their young lives.

The Small Messiah

Yet anomer story of Christ and his effect
on the world. Told from the revolutionary
viewpoint of Christ as a small, overweight
blond man. The movte begins with a scene
depicting Christ shaving the has no
beard.) over a large breakfast of honey
and locusts.

He is struck bya vision — a Vision of how
life would be if no one cared that he was
small, blond, and overweight and if ap»
pearances mattered less than the goodness
in one's soul.

He travels the country preaching his
new vision of life at soirees and dinner par
ties teach meal he eats as though it were
his lasti. He preaches but no one listens
and no one cares. until that one fateful day
when the crowd is apparently spellbound,
and they cannot tear their eyes away Ac-
tually, he has a complete locust trapped
between his left molar and front incisor.

Not knowing this, Christ becomes
animated, his inner light shines from
within, captivating the attention of the
crowd.

The masses begin to listen, forgetting
the locust, and the room is filled with a
feeling ol light and peace, This small,
blond, overweight Christ becomes more
than a tall, thin bearded Christ could ever
be 7 a man who overcame his
beginnings .,
