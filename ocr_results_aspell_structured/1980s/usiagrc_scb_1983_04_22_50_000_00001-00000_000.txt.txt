Hart hits
Grinnell on
campaign ,
tour

by Brad VanderLinder

US Senator Gary Hart (Dem., Colv
orado) brought his presidential campaign
to Grinnell College last Friday hoping to
drumup support tor next year's lowa
caucuses.

Hart opened alter a 45 minute delay by
briefly discussing how America is moving
towards a diversified economy based more
on services that require “new understans
dings and skills" with an increasingly
greater emphaSis on math, selences and
foreign languages. He described these as
essential elements for competing in the in-
ternational marketplace oi the 19305,

After his eight minute talk, Hart fielded
student questions dealing with a wide
range of topics.

When asked about the Situation in El
Salvador, the Senator called for a “180
degree shitt in US. policy” by withholding
all future economic and military aid until
El Salvador “makes significant
democratic reforms "

Hart also called on the Reagan ad
ministration to end “'1 covert action
against the Sandinlsta government in
Nicaragua. He pointed out that it is a
mistake to View the “Soviets as behind
every bush," and that the problems of
Latin America are more complex than this
hardhne approach recognized

Impressed 'with the deeprstudent in
terest, Hart and his staff decided to delay
leaving for the next campaign stop, taking
time during happy hour in the Pub tor a
beer and to talk with more students.

“We are amazed at the student turnout
to hear the Senator speak," said staffer
Doug Hart, no relation to the senator, Sipps
ing a beer. “We were at Iowa State, which
has a student body oi almost 30,000, and
didn't attract nearly as much interest as
here in Grinnell '

Hart did tind room to praise the Reagan
Administration's innovative “paymentqns
kind (Pth program to reduce the massive
farm surpluses that have depressed the
farm economy, calling it "a fundamental»
ly good program."

After the speech, Hart gave a joint intel'r
View with the Scarlet and Black, (dunnell
Herald-Register, and the Des Moines
Register.

5&3: when elected to the United States
Senate in 1974, you said, “This nation
desperately needs a new generation of
thinkers and doers who will question old
premises and disregard old alliances."
What did you mean by this comment and
how are you translating mat thought into
your presidential campaign?

Hart: We are in a period in which the
problems are changing. They're not like
the ones we've had previously. Many or
them are new. and that necessarily re
quires some new thinking to solve those
problems, much like what 1 have said to

‘ rbatov stirs interest
and controversy

by Terri Porter and Eric Weiss

“We have not witnessed such a bad state in
U.S.~Sovlet relations in the 20 years since
the Cuban missile crisis," according to
Georgi Arbatov. This sentiment was the
main mrust ol Arbatov's message to the
Grinnell community delivered during his
visit here last Monday and Tuesday.

Arbalov, a top Soviet offiClal, usually at-
tracts a lot or attention when he visits the
United States, lrequcntly calling for better
U S . Soviet relations and an end to the
cold War

However, when Arbatov began his
247day swing through the us. last week,
the college was informed by the us state
Department that his visa would be in
jeopardy if he spoke about international
ailairs to the national media. The state-
ment read in part.

it ties in with the principle or rccipi'ocis
ty. oii previous visits. Mr. Ai-hstov,
although he applied to enter the U.S. for
scholarly purposes. acted as an uiioiiicinl
spokesman tor Soviet positions. We felt
that his visit provided mi appropriate oc-
casion to limit his access to the me is,

The restrictions don't apply to the
American press: they apply to Mr. Ar-
hutov.

Although it wasn’t explicity stated that
his visa would be taken away it he talked to
the national media, “They implied that his
visa was in danger," said Professor
Robert Grey, Arbatov's host during his

stay in Grinnell.
While in Grinnell, Arbatov visited

several classes and had lunch with some
students. One highlight or his visit was a
trip to an 800 acre hog iarm. Newsweek
and um reporters were among the many
media representatives on hand to cover

theevcnt.
William Deminoti, public relations

director or the college, stated that the last
visitor to Grinnell who attracted such na-
tional attention was Ted Kennedy, who
visited Grinnell during the 1979 primaries.

Before Arbutov‘s iirst lecture Monday
night, approximately 350 students stood
outside Darby Gymnasium waiting for ni»
batov, in a candlelight vigil lor peace and
an end to the nuclear arms race.

Said one student, “We're out here to
show our support for any arms negotia-
tions and to show that were against
nuclear arms. It's really a support
gesture. We're hoping he will come
through the hunt door and see all of this."

Another student stated, “It's all about
understanding instead or hating," One
lather with his two young doughers at the

 

vigil commented, “Its a small step that
we took to get bthels thinking about the
situation.”

Discussing the topic of Monday
evening 5 lectuie “Soviet View of
U. S. Some! Relations" Arbatov began by
saying, “These relations are bad, very bad
indeed.”

He attributed these bad relations to a
major iault in American policy, and added
that the poor state of these relations is
“very harmiul and dangerous to both our
countries as well as the world at large."
He continued, "The normalization and im-
provement of these relations are a matter
of extreme importance and very high
priority."

Arbaiov noted the deterioration of
Soviet-U5. relations and offered several
examples as prooi ol this deterioration.
l-lis major emphasis was the lack of a
nuclear freeze or arms control negotias
tions. Combined with the escalation of the
arms race, these shortcomings increase
the danger of war, according to Arbatov.

Further evidence of deterioration bet
ween the two nations includes “the
worsening of bllateral relations in all
spheres: economic, cultural and
political." He added, “Deterioration
means an increase in tensions."

Arbatov's second lecture on Tuesday
night was based on the Soviet belief that
many of the US. claims of Russian
superiority in the arms race are untound-
ed.

"I'm not going to argue that the USSR is
not stronger militarily than it was ten
years ago," Arbatov commented. He ex»
plained Russia‘s militarism by saying,
"We lelt that we had to catch up, and it
took us until the early 705 to close the gap."

Arbatov called for an end to the nuclear
arlns race. He stated that the U S nuclear
buildup is “very senseless " in response to
the idea that Soviets would not react to
Reagan's proposed deiensivc system, Ar-
batov declared. “Mr President, you have
got to be kidding! "

Arbatov defended the Soviet reaction
with his statement that the Soviet Union,
never having wanted to get involved in the
arms race in the first place, has had to
build up its nuclear system ior detensive
purposes,

He said, “The Soviet Union has ad-
vacated nuclear disarmament ever since
the atomic age began," and added, “We
continue to believe that nuclear weapons
must be banned totally and that there are
practical ways of achieving this task.”

Cabinet ,
activities by-laws

passed at JB

by Jane Kaufman

President-elect John Scharff's an-
nouncement of cabinet positions
highlighted Wednesday nights SGA Joint
Board meeting.

Next year s positions will be ﬁlled by:
Robbie Sckalor, treasurer; Beth Keegan
social coordinator; Randy cochrell, stu
dent coordinator Administrative assxstant
should be announced sometime today.

Discussion at Harley leer's proposed
bylaw requiring iuture SGA vice
presidents and presidents to he on board
and to have two oilice hours per week took
up much of the meeting.

Liker explained, “I think one of the ma»
jor problems or SGA is alienation irom the
student body, I originally thought that the
president and vice presidnet should he re-
quired to live on campus. I don’t think it's
that much to ask of the p esident and vice
president." ‘

Liker cited Doug Rowe, SGA president
last year, “as a periect case in point He
wasn’t on board... living on campus and
being on board added to the apathy,”

JB representatives expressed opposition
to his proposal. Peder Fretheim, Loose
Hall president, called the board require»
merit “a big sacrifice,"

Off-Campus College-Owned Housing
Representative Rob Curley stated, “I
think it's unfounded to say that offscampus
students don't participate in campus ac»
tivities,"

However, Allison Paich, social coor—
dinator disagreed, saying, “I think there is
a lot or important input from living in
dorms.” Her objections stemmed from the
financial discrimination for those students
living oil campus

Discussion ended and the bylaw failed.

A bylaw proposed by Off»Campus Nuns
College Owned Housing Representative
Eric Secoy establishing a concerts come
mittee was approved after discussion, The
committee will assist the concerts chair.

Peter Hautzinger. Haines Hall presi-
dent, said ol the bylaw, “Hall presidents
and the people at the hall should have
some input on hands llor all-campus
eventsl " 0n the same subject, Curley ad-
ded. ”Don‘t you think it would be a good
idea if a JB representative was a tem-
porary [Concerts Committee} member?"

A bylaw also proposed by Secoy creating
a tilms committee was approved by J. B. in
support or his proposal, Secoy stated, “I
think if you have ﬁve people making deci-
swns it promotes diversity."

OCCO Representative Mike Gorman
suggested that the committee be a “three-
person colloquium rather than five to
facilitate consensus.” Norris Hall Presi»
dent Dave Mosher supported Gorman, but
the suggestion was not added. No further
discussmn (allowed, and the bylaw, which
requires consent ol the committee in
chonsmg films, was approved.
