Radicals, Beware of Alienating the Moderates Thanks for Such an Enlightening

 

To the Editor:

I‘m sure this letter will be sur»
rounded by other letters which are in
response to the now infamous Ms.
Goodwrcnch article. but this letteris
merely prompted by ”l‘he Article,"
not written in response to it. I am
writing about something which is
more troubling than that article in
and of itself. I am writing about a
whole radicalAextremist attitude that
isbeginningtotakeholdatGrinnell.
And I am writing about an important
group of people whoarebeing alien-
ated by this movement.

People like myself are moderate
to conservative in our views, but
accepting of things around us. We
are willing to accept change, but it
must occur slowly as not to upset the
ideological balance we have in our
lives.

In reference to this last point lies
the problem with the Ms.
Goodwrench article. We are in the
truest sense of the word “Grinnelli-
ans." We came to this school with
many misconceptions about homo-
sexuality,women'srighis,civilrights

and many other things, but Grinnell
wasamelting potwhere we couldbe
ourselves yet learn and giow to ac-
cept other ideas which surrounded
us. We realizethat“Silence:Death”
and that generic terms such as “post-
man” and “congressman" only
propagate sexual discrim ination, but
taking extreme positions will not
make us fight harder, it will only
make us step back and take a much
moreskeptical view.Wewere taught
that liberal meantacceptingallviews
and ideas while forming, maintain-
ing or changing our own value sys-
tems.

The extremists. the people most
often associated with liberalism,have
lost sight of this. They carry the flag
of liberalism while being closed
minded to the moderate positions
that surround them. This forces the
people in themiddletomakeachoice
and the choice will most likely be an
anti-extremist stand.

Thus, meextremistposition merely
polarizes people’s views on a given
topic instead of drawing everyone
closer together.

Maybe it is our“apathy" or appar-
ent acceptance of the status quo that
the extremists are trying to tight.
Well, among us, it is working. With
every article you write, we become
less apathetic and more critical of
your position.

It is important to mobilize us, the
people in the middle, because we
have great numbers. Don’t scare us
off, though. because we can help
fight the battle in our own subtle
way, by talking to people who think
like us and making changes at a
grass roots level.

Glimpse of the ‘Real’ World

 

To the Editor:

lwouldliketothankDiannaWard,
et at. for their enlightening glimpse
of the real world.

I have only one question: Is this
term “womyn” going to be used for
these new hybrids thatyou speak of!
Because ifit is, I would suggest not
using it for soon-to-beroutdaled,
malerproduced models like your
selves.

BENJAMIN ROOT

To the Editor:

In response to last week‘s article
written by the five womyn:

Don’t you have anything better to
do?

I just hope you realize that your
requestfor more Birkenstocks means
only one thing...
