Grinnell Fares

Well in

Graceland Scrimmage

By Dave Ressner

No! Not as in Elvis. These guys
were a lot bigger than "The King."
The Grinnell football team scrim-
maged with Graceland College (of
Lamoni, Iowa) last Saturday, and the
Pioneers fared respectably against
their oversized opponents.

Graceland scored the only points
of the game though, on a 25-yard
pass-play touchdown which capped
off a drive including two other long
receptions. From there on, it was a
battle of the defenses, and Graceland
appeared Io'be winning that as well,
until they gotto ﬁrst and goal on the
Grinnell goal-line. Four downs later,
.Gtaceland found themselves in that.

Women’s Volleyball Hopeful

with Pioneering New Image

By Julie Kaster

The Grinnell women‘s volleyball
team has taken on a new look.

Foremost is the increase in the
roster to 20 playerspwith the com-
mitment of eight freshmen, three
sophomores competing in their first
year, and nine returnees which in-
clude: Capt. Ann Athorp, Capti
Sonya Cavigelli,Susan EgbenJenv
nifer Hughes. Gayatri Jayaraman,
Amy Robinson, Sandy Tibbetts,
Malia Watson and Courtney Wells.

In addition, a full roster will pro-
vide the opportunity for several dif-
ferent team rotations, thus allowing
each player to earn ample court»
time. Also. the added pressure of
competing for positions will raise
the level at which each individual
performs.

The new an'ivals have made an
immediate impact with their height
and fundamentallysound techniques
and work ethic, since these were
areas of weakness evident in last
year's learn.

Coach Sheila Cain, entering her
second year as head coach, has also
implemented a new defense which
the team believes will work much
better than the defense previously
used.

In d1cirdcbut,tthioneers dropped
their firstmatch to Quincy College,
15-8 and 15-5. and later lost to host
William Penn College by scores of
15-8 and 15-3. Although the player:

went irtto the game with conﬁdence,
those inevitable “first-game jitters“
overshadowed their abilities in the
crticial areas of serving and passing

According to captain SonyaCavi-
gelli, “We were disappointed in the
way we played, but what is impor-
tant to our success is the experience
whichcomesfromplayingtogether.”

In last year‘s match-Up. Grinnell
shut out the alumni 5-0. But this
year, the “old-timers" returned “all
corked-up," saidcoach John Pﬁtsch,
and they pushed their Pioneer suc-
cessors to a close 3-2 final score.

Pfirsch calls this scason“arebuild-
ing effort” as he is trying to replenish
the half of the team he lost to gradu-
ation lastyear. He hasmuch hope for
three freshman in particular, though.
Peter Greif, who had Sunday’s win-
ning assist, Doug Hodum and Chang
Chae are especially promising and
may play a part in this season’s
pursuit of the “very good" Knox
team.

Pfitsch called called his team's
performance “ﬂat," but blamed that
mostly on the low-key attitude he
encouraged before the gamer Mark
St. Andre scored the winning goal,
but soon after was knocked out of
the game with hmisedn'bs. St. Andre
believes he can still play this week-
end at the Minnesota Invitational.

The team had another scare when
Tom McCullen collided with an-
other player as he was going up to
head the ball. There was no concus-
sion. but an ambulance was calledas
a precaution. McCullen is all right
and has resumed practice. The men

Shuts Out Wartburg

~ Cathy Zabel, captain

Tuesday, the Grinnell women’s
soccerteam traveled to Waverly and
defeated Wartburg College 7-0. The
scrimmage, played on a ﬁeld with
two sidelines, fragranced by manure
and accompanied by the melodic
cries of nearby pigs being slaugh-
tered. began slowly.

Both teams were clad in identical

great deals The similarities ended
there

Wartburg, in their first year of
Vatsily play, lacked the skills of Ihe

Grinnell team. Bolstered by superb
recniits. Grinnell took advanmge of
Wartburg and clearly dominated.
Marta “the Sparta” Fraboni led the
team off to a fabulous start. Within
five minutes from the first blow of
the whistle, Fraborii headed a ball
over the keeper‘s head. Dani “A. O.
Kaopectate” Aoki stole some of
Fraboni‘s glory as she knocked the
ball in the net.
