Cabinet

Continued from Page 5 .
where we can ﬁnd it diiterent ways
and will not be scared to go out on a
limb. I think that would be the top
appointment, the treasurer.

Brad Sheridan

1 think the .ludco appointments
are really important. but Judeo
just doesn't come up that much.
Films and concerts. l'm going to
have to say Judco, because putting
myself in the student's shoes that
has to go up. you're really putting a
lot of trust in Judco to be very [air
and very judging and making sure
you‘re innocent until you're proven
guilty, especially when your
education is on the line.

Dave Steinman

This new person will be in charge
of the finances lor iilms'and con-
certs. What that person will be due
ing will be overseeing how these
committees go about getting infor-
mation about What students Want
to see. I think that's one of my big
campaign things. it's the only ma
jor thing that 1 state that l‘m really
going to do. i can say that i will do
that. We have a serious coma
munication problem with the
students. You can't make people
be non-apathetic. What you can do
is give them easy ways to get their
input in, so it doesn't take a lot or
personal time. i know a lot of peas
ple feel like they have to do this
and this to get what they want
done. and they don't want to take
the time. it we give them easy
ways to get their opinions to SGA,
like through this new survey coma
mittee we have, Mr. Hawthorne is
going to help set up more extensive
surveys, and get student opinion
and use it constructively. with
these new alcohol laws. this is go-
ing to be our main source of social
activity. The administration is go
ing to try to move us away irom the
big parties. I don't want to do that,
but people are going to be
underage and they're not going to
be able to go to The Bar or Links
without being carded. We're going
to have to have more extensive
ways at nonalcoholic things to do.
Let the students worry about gets
ting their own alcohol. Anyone who
knows me would deﬁnitely say that
i am not your serious non~partier,
so i will definitely iightanyonetrya
ing to take away large parties or
any social beer drinking activities
on campus. But i do see where
we're going to have to work with
the administration to get a
balance, and get a more students
oriented films and concerts, The
money's there. We have money to
have really good lilms and cons
certs and it's not being used to its
fullest extent. You have one films
and one concerts chair who really
pick the iilms and concerts you
see.

What kind of outside
political issues do you feel
are appropriate to bring in
to your job?

Picshctte llamb

i think if the students feel that
it's a need or if the concern is an
issue. then I think SGA should [eel
that it is a concerned issue and not
necessarily take a stand on it one
way or another but to have the
capabilities of being able to bring it
to SGA and have SGA dectde
whether or not tosupport it,orilan
initiative needs to be made and the
whole campus brought in on it. I
think the best way to handle out
side political issues is to take it to
the student body, because i don‘t
think SGA should be the sole factor
in determining something as broad
as that. When you leave Grinneli
you are outside in the real world
and I don't think Grllinell should
just take one stand on it: it is best
to put it into an initiative and have

Presidential Interviews

the students vote on it and bring
the results to SGA so it is the
students Voting on it and not just
SGA.

Paul Froese

world love. i believe in love.
John Lennon said “Love is all we
need," and I‘m behind him one
hundred percent on that state-
ment.

Greg Evans

I think that any way student
money or college money is being
spent I think that we have a'direct
iniluence in. i think that as a cam-
pusweshouidtakeanactiverole in
peaceiul-type things, things that
our campus supports. That means
nuclear disarmament. it We're in-
terested in that, we should do that.
This peace institute i think is a
very good thing that the students
support. l was very happy with the
turnout to the caucus. I think at
the national level we should take
an inﬂuence in it because we can
inlluence other colleges as well as
ourselves.

Dianna Ward

Right now i think divestment
hasn't worked because we haven't
done it globally, Those things we
divested, people invested in. That
should have been done a little bit
more maturely. Divestment would
work, had we done it globally.
That's something students need to
work on — not necessarily
American companies divesting,
but pushing ior global divestment.
ldon't see a stress on global divest-
ment. i don't think people realize
how important that would be.

Another issue I see. a really big
issue on this campus that's an out
side political issue. is the
homeless. As students. there are
little things we can do, like the peas
pie who go to the shelters every
week That touches a few people.
That's great, But i think more peti~
tions need to go out {or other
things. like the people who are
making millions oi dollars off of
slums, things like that. I think we
need to orient ourselves in difa
Ierent ways. Keep writing your
senators, but I think we need to let
these people know that we don't
like what they're doing, those peo-
ple directly, and let our senators
know That‘s a really tough ques
tion, what to do about the
homeless, but I think we‘re domg
almost as much as we can as far as
the petitioning, but I don't see
enough involvement in what we do
here. i don't see enough people go
ing on weekends, and I guess l've
been guilty oi that and so have
other people. Like I said. I'd like to
get more involved in that because
it's so easy to torget it ior your own
sake, i think people in general need
to get more involved in that issue,

One big issue to me 15 the gay
and lesbian rights. 1 see people Laks
ing the liberal attitude that it's
okay, "I don‘t care. i like gay peo-
ple. i wouldn't do it myseli or
anything," but i think people need
in start realizing that this Is the on-
ly type oi minority group that peo-
ple start paying attention to as a
moral issue, Whenever they take it
to court. it's "immoral " Well, why
is it immoral? "Because it says so
in the Bible,” Whatever happened
to separation of church and slate?
is it hurting anybody to be gay? i
think students need to start thinks
ing about that, Matt Macho wrote
up a really good initiative on that.
ihal il's the only minority thal peo
ple think of as a Bible issue. 15 ii
harmlul to the country? No. it's not
harmful to the country I think
AIDS is another issue that we need
to be paying attention lo l‘m not
knocking anybody ior their sexual
habits, but AIDS is touching
everybody, The only Ale things
\vc'vc had on this campus. there is

a very low attendance. it gives me
the idea that people think that this
is a gay issue. That right there
rally scares me. lsee a lot on this
campus that people should take an
interest in AIDS, from some of the
habib I've seen. and these people
don't take an interest.

I guess Nicaragua happens to be
a big issue on this campus. and
Central America. I know some

'about it. i don't know everything

abou t. I think that what Students
on this campus are doing tor that
as far as petitioning and lasting ior
peace aid, i think that's a really
good thing. i don't have an answer
because we're getting two sides or
the story, You get the Far Lelt idea
and you get the Far Right idea.
Politically, I don't know what we
can do, i mysell don't agree with
us being down there because i
don‘t agree with saying what
governments are legitimate and
what governments are ils
legitimate. it's basically to me a
superior-type attitude which really
makes me sick to the stomach. I
think working for humanitarian
aid is something the students on
this campus are really involved in.
and I think that's really good. I
think it's really important ior them
to be doing that because, like I
said. political questions we don't
have the answer to. We don't know
what they're really doing there.
They say, "We‘re giving
humanitarian aid." It's
documented that the humanitarian
aid never makes it to the people it's
supposed to touch.

Brad Sheridan

Like everybody in this school ior
years and years, peace is a big
thing. with disarmament and the
nuclear freeze and everything gov
ing on right now with Gorbachev.
l'm not going to claim to be an ex
pert on anything out there. i put
more time into things here than i
have to read the newspaper. but i
would say that that's something
important that I stand for.

Dave steiniiiuii

I see SGA President's role as be.
ing a liaison between the students
and the administration for social
activities on this Campus. If a stu~
dent group comes to me with a pro
blem. I'll do everything i can to
help. l'm not going to have any per
sonal outside influence on what I
think is more important than other
things, it the majority oi the people
want to see [his then I'll do my best
to handle it. but l'm not going to
say I'm totally for this so that‘s
what l'm going to put all my time
into. it that's what the people want
then that's what I'll do, I wouldn't
\vani to bring my own personal

things into the iob in that respect
______

How much involvement
will you have with other
organizations next year?

Will this take away from
your commitment as presi-
dent?

Pleslicite llainb

Right now, not being president
I'm involved in about seven dit-
lerent organizations. If I'm elected
president then, knowing that it
takes a lot of time, I'll lirst have to
see how to balance my schedule
and ii' i lccl like being in the other
groups jeopardizes an eiieciivc
way to be president then I‘ll have
sense enough to step out oi those
other organizations One thing that
I know i will dciinitely be in is YGB
(Young Gifted and Black) because
lhut‘s a spiritual outlet for me,
Other than that i will wait and see
exactly what the load is. how maliy
committee meetings I have a
week. and then alter the iirst two
weeks oi school I'll make a good

judgment and maybe not par-
ticipate in as much. I think being
SGA President. a lot of the cone
cams and issues. If SGA is struc~
tured right and runs the way i
would like it to run, will be brought
to the committees and SGA and
other organizations so I would not
have a problem with stepping
back.

Paul Frocse
The SGA will come ﬁrst. I'm a
SGA man first and last.

Greg Evans

This year l'm heavily involved
with my running and other than
that, no other group commitments.
I spent on the average 2-3 hours a
day on SGA since i've been back
this semester. I've also been runn-
ing track and it hasn't been a con-
tlict. i don't think that'll be a pres
blem at all.

Di nlla Ward

Right now I'm a member of a lot
oi other organizations and I don't
think that would take away [mm
my SGA president, I think it would
add to it because I'd be in touch
with those problems. I'd be able to
bring those ideas back. We'd be
able to discuss them. Presently,
I'm on the women‘s soccer team, I
am presentiy more or less a
member of GCGC. I go to Women's
Group every once in a while, Black
Women's Support Group. I'm stars
[ing this, I used to do this at home
every other weekend with my
mother. but l'm going to start get»
ting more involved with the
homeless. That's a really touchy
subject because it was pretty
depressing to even work like that
when you know you didn't have too
much control, and that's why i
pretty much stopped. But l'm geta
ting more involved with that. I
went last week. And I'm going to
try to do that every other week I
have a lot of friends that are
members or other organizations
and most of my conversations end
up being what's going on on cam
pus. I have a lot of friends on the
iootball team. They're definitely
having problems. I think knowing
these problems exist. i can bring
them back. we can discuss them.
and one oi the things I want to work
toward is campus unity. because i
don't think there's enough support
between the groups. i mean,
there‘s competitivesport-phobia
on this campus Competitive sports
can add something. Especially
since I'm a member of that, it pret-
ty much touches close to home, I'd
like to see more involvemeni of
other organizations supporting
these organizations. 1 want to have
a committee made up or all these
organizations and competitive-
sport grpups so that they can have
some say in what's going on on
campus, Or maybe they have a
problem and uiey want to bring it
in to SGA. I want them to feel that
they are represented. I think that's
really important when you're talk-
ing about a student government
that you should be able to bring
your problems to them and be sure
that they know that they're not be-
ing slighted, "Oh. you‘re a ieotball
player, That's last on our agenda,"
or something like that I think be-
ing members oi these organiza»
tions will more help than hurl
anything.

slieiulan

l m still debating whether i wanl
lo play baseball for a lourth year
If i did play baseball, in be gone
ior four or two games. which
hasn't hurt me bciore I've never
been president bciore. either. so i
don't know. it I'm president, I'm
going to cut out most of the slut:
that I've been doing, 1 \von'l be in

Student Affairs, I won't be an HAC
or an SA. All I'll really have to
worry about is classes. I would
basically concentrate my time on
president because you have ofﬁce
hours and all that kind oi stuff.

Dave Steinman. - . .1.

I'm just going to be involved with
baseball and that‘s just second halt
oi the year. and'it really shouldn't
take that much time. i don't see
any problem with that.

If you do not win, what are
your plans for next year?

I’Ieshette [lamb

ll 1 don't win, I'm going to go
back to being involved in all of the
student groups that I've been in-
volved in. lwasthinking about run-
ning for SGA senator. and that's

' probably what I'll do is run {or

senator, If I decide against that or
I don't win that. I‘ll stay a part of
all the campus organizations that
I'm a part oi as an active member.

PuillFroese - ~ -

I'll dropout oI Grinnellsr
ui-eg Evans ,, .

ii i do notwin. i plan to either ap-
ply ror the cabinet position or
director it this new cabinet position
goes through. or else parliamenc
tarian, because i feel that l have a
commitment to SGA and I also
have the expertise that SGA can
use in those areas.

niaiuui iiard

ii i do not win, I'm not going to
go cry. I'm not going to jump on a
building or anything like that. The
reason l'm running tor SGA presi-
dent is because i see things that
need to be done that l'm working
on on my own. I‘d like to have the
resources to work with, i think
that's the most glamorous part oi
SGA president to me. Ii 1 don‘t
make it as SGA president. i will
continue to do this. but i wouldn't
have as many people to work with.
I would take.my ideas to SGA
Right now l'm working on getting a
phonathon. i enjoy doing stuti like
this. I'd continue to do this ii i
wasn‘t SGA president...

Hl‘ull shei-iiiun

i know whal my plans tor iirst
semester are. i got accepted to
Grinnell»in~Lolldon, And so. I
would be going lo London lor the
first semester. Second semester.
in come back and supposedly it's
too late to apply to be a HAC tor the
next year but i‘d look into it and
tell them what's going on and see ii
i could weasel into it one way or
another, I'd play baseball again.
[‘11 be a tour guide. I‘d do
everything I'm doing now wiih the
exception of London lirst
semester.

Dave S|eirimui|

l'm going to apply ior that posi-
tion of finance overseer oi concerts
and ii lms.

By your estimation, how
many hours a week will you
spend as president?

I’lcshciie ilamb

Whatever's necessary to get the
job done, it's hard to say )0 to 15
hours. There might be one week
where l have to spend 15 to 25
hours Not being iamiliar enough
with exactly what a Inlal commit-
ment it is. I don't think thai you
can delinllely say how many hours
that l'm going to devote to this. i
only can say I'm going to devote as
much time as necessary for the job
to get done
