Blazing Saddles

by Matthew Macho

Blazing Saddles is a fun~ﬁllod
romp. a festival of bad taste from
the King of bad taste (when John
Waters isn't around), Mel Brooks.
Mel hasn't been doing too well
lately -» I can‘t remember when
this movie came out, but it was
some time ago, and just about
the only noteworthy film he has
produced since was The Man
With One Red Shoe, which, like
Michael Jackson. was really re-
ally BAD.

But the fact that Mel Brooks
is now a mere sheltof his former
comedic genius need not concem
you. All that matters is that one
of his best gems. Blazing Sad-
dles, is coming here to entertain
you. And entertain you it will,
provided you check your taste at
the door. Brooks plays around
with the whole Western film
genre. putting a black sherrif and
Gene Wilder (as the legendary
Wake Kid, the perennial drunken
gunslinger) together in a racist
wild west town charted for de-
struction by Headly Lamarr
(Harvey Korman), the perennial
big railroad fascist. Madeline
Kahn makes an appearance, doing
an excellent Marlene Dietrich
impersonation

The gags are cheap. fast. and
funny, and there's plenty of them,
Take a break from studies
(assuming you'll be studying to
begin with) and laugh along with
this, Mel's best film. This one's
playing in Hektor's, which may
be a good idea, since the sound
systems in South Lounge and
ARH of late seem to be some
sort of arrangement of string and
dixie cups.

Broadcast News

The Academy Award- -winning
story of a love triangle involving
three successful television jour-
nalists, James L. Brooks

Tyler Moore.

Scarface

Al Pacino stars in this mod-
ern gangster epic. Brian Depalma
depicts Miami, Florida much like
the Chicago of the 1920s boot-
legger fame. Pacino plays Tony
Montana, a hard-nosed immigrant
who plans to carve out his own
version of the American Dream.

Tess

Tess is Roman Polanski's
vision of Thomas Hardy's classic
novel. The story of Tess
(Natasia Kinski) takes us from
her tragic seduction through her
entire hardship-packed life.
Polanski paints a beautiful vision
of the English countryside in this
departure from his more violent
ﬁlms.

The Big Chill

The Big Chiigl unites a cast
of numerous young stars of the
80's. It is the story (a la Return

Diner
Diner is Barry Levinson's
ﬁrst major ﬁlm, and perhaps his
ﬁnest. It follows a group of
young men growing up in Balti»
more in the 50's. The actors
have all gone on to big things,
but for most this remains their
best film.

Tin‘ Men

Richard Dreyfuss and Danny
Dévito star as aluminum siding
salesmen is 1960‘s Baltimore.
Barry Levinson's followup to
Diner is just as funny, once
again showcasing the director's
ability to capture the lost art of
conversation among characters.

Sturmun

Jeff Bridges comes down to
earth, clones himself into the
image of Karen Allen's dead hus-
band and forces her to drive him
to his rendevous with his mother
ship. Yes, from all this, a love
story emerges in this 1984
sleeper hit. Diret tor John
Carpenter (Halloween) seems a
lot more sedate in this romantic
comedy.

Goldfinger
Sean Connery stars as Bond
in the 1963 classic. The villian

many "Bondisms" that began in

the past 10 Bond movies.

Academy Award winner Gigi

by Georgia Denlel

Gigi is directed by Vincent
Minnelli, perhaps the most suc'
cessful maker of ﬁlm musicals.

discovered in Paris by Gene
Kelly. both seemed born to play
the respective roles of the
sophisticated "man-about-Lown"
and the wide»eyed innocent Gigi.

actors Maurice Chevalier and
