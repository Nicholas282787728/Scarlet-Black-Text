general. Said Earle, “The more
you communicate, the more you
know where the other guy is com-
ing trom". Earle also advocates
heightened study in each country
of the other nation‘s culture and
history, stated Earle. “The more
you know about each other...the
less likely you are to have pro-
blems..."

Longrrange planning oi iuture
arms negotiations is also oi top
priority according to Earle. He
holds that one oi the best ways to
avoid conllicts between the us.
and the USSR. is to discuss the

next generation oi deployments in .l

addition to dealing with the present
arsenals.

The Strategic Arms Reduction
Talks (START) are also a key
issue in arms negotiation, said
Earle. Earle sees START as being
even more significant than the Inn
termediate Nuclear Forces (INF)
treaty. START deals with a
greater number oi “more imporr
tant" weapons than does the INF
treaty, making START more
substantial than lNF in the long
run, said Earle. However, the
U,S.'s Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDD remains the largest hurdle
for START.

The issue of SDI, Said Earle,
must be addressed. He argues that
the Reagan Administration's ac-
tions with respect to SDI are in
direct violation of the 1972 Anti
Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty
which stipulates that there may be
no testing or deployment oi
ballistic detense systems. The
ABM treaty has been reinterpreted
by the Administration in order to
allow for SDI, said Earle. The
question of commitment in this
area must be cleared up beiore
significant progress may be made
in U,S./Soviet arms negotiations.

Although he discounts the
possibility oi a nuclear test ban
before the end of 1989 because of
the Reagan Administration's com»
mitment to SDI, Earle does credit
the Current administration with
making great strides in arms con»
trol agreements with the Soviet
Union. The progress in
U.S./U.S.S.R, arms agreements
within the last eighteen months imr
presses Earle, He also credits Gore
bachev for the advances made in
this area. Earle said he is fairly
coniident of Gnrbachev's gev
nuineness. Said Earle. “He tGor-
bachev) is not a pal of the United
States, He's a Soviet. But he’s a
sensible Soviet..."

Earle remains optimistic in his
outlook on arms control between
the United States and die Soviet
Union, Although he says “We're
never going to get rid of nuclear
weapons...", Earle also contends
that we can “...plan to have asym-
metrical forces that are balanced
and stable". The mutual needs of
the U.S and the USSR. will dic»
late this. said Earle, As he told the
audience in south Lounge on Mon
day, “We (the U.S. and the
U.s.s.R.i share a common goal,
which is not to be incinerated".

Our last ride had been on the
back of a flatbed truck, loaded with
so much stuii that we were cling-
ing to the iloor near the back end,
hoping that our backpacks and our
bodies would make it to the stop,

But a wonderful southern Mexico
sunset kept us occupied. The
streaks ot orange and red seemed
to last for hours. and we had even
risked taking out cameras and get
ting pictures from our precarious
positions.

When we get oii it's dark.
There's a 2thour truck stop in
sight. and we eat there, hoping to
hitch a ride toward Guatemala
lrom someone passing through.

No one seems to be going east, or
it they are they don't have room or
won't take us. Alter about an hour
we linally iind a caravan of six
trucks and pickups transporting
cars and truck cabs into
Guatemala. They agree to take us
as far as the border.

I ride in a cab. The driver looks
middle-aged. How do I like Mexico,
he wonders. I talk about how warm
it is, and how cold our January
drive was trom Chicago to
Flagstaii. He laughs, He was In

I ask him where he lives.
Guatemala City, he says.

Randomly pick up a newspaper
in son Jose and chances are you‘ll
get either La Nat-ion or La
Republica. Along with
a third paper. La Prensa Libre
tThe Free Press), these publica-
tions represent the vast majority
oi newspaper circulation in Costa
Rica.

The general bias oi the three
main newspapers is one oi conser-
vatism. Although none is a govern
ment publication, they are sup
ported predominantly by wealthier
industrialists and busmessmen
who buy advertisements in them.
The iinancial support leads to a
signiticant amount oi iniluence
that the advertisers can Wield
regarding what the newspapers
will print.

One major issue in the news at
present is Nicaragua. The
perspective presented in these
three newspapers is generally
against the Nicaraguan govern-
ment,

On February 13. to 'nstanc .La
Nacion included a icurpage sup
plement detailing the current
situation In Nicaragua. The ar-
ticles focused on the violence in
Masaya. and on plans oi the
Nicaraguan government to in-
crease military power, painting a
general impression of a nation on
the edge of revolution, The section
also mentioned fundraising for the
“Nicaraguan Resistance" in the
United States. showing a
photocopy oi a check from Senator
Robert Dole for “humanitarian
aid" ,

Three editorials Contained in the
supplement were entitled “Corr
gress said ‘no' to peace," “It is the
hour ol the masses." and “An op»
portunity [or peace" 7 reierring to
the viol‘ -c in Masaya.

Thci- \\ other newspapers
in Costa Rica |o offer Views of
other perspectives. chcral years
ago, each or the two major political
parties tried to found their own
newspapers. However. the big
businesses agreed not to advertise
in the new publications, and
without that iinancial support the
newspapers soon tailed.

One oi the only other serious
newspapers in Costa Rica is the
Seminaria Universidad, a weekly
publication written by prolessurs
and students at the University 0i
Costa Rica, Along with news ar~
ticles. this newspaper includes are

with the seeming oligopoly oi
newspapers in Costa Rica, is there

my iamily here teach ACM student
lives with a Costa Rican family in
San Jose) about [he issue. Both my
mothcr and father agreed that
ireedom oi the press In Costa Rica
is as prevalent as it is in the United
States

However, a’ reporter at La Nae
cion gave me a different stor
Freedom oi the press, the report
said, exists largely in the United
States because oi the wide variety
oi publications and the intense
competition between reporters,
and especially between
newspapers, Such competition is
nearly absent here

Furthermore, there is a restrice
live press law in Costa Rica that
must be iollowed, especially by the
wealthier newspapers The law
says that a reporter must have ab
solute prool oi iniormatlon, that is.
printed or taped material. to
publish it. Otherwise the
newspaper is subject to law suits.
La Nacion is currently involved in
several suits.

One example oi Costa Rica's
