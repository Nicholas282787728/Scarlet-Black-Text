to the style oi Fitzgerald and does
a reasonably good job oi it. One
Still hears the narrative 01 Nick,
Gatsoy's neighbor The movie
depicts the green light and the eyes
oi the doctor, as well as most oi

movie maintains the stinging

Key Largo

“Key Largo” (1948) is a truly all-
star production. Directed by John
Huston, it stars Humphrey Bogart,
Lauren Bacall, Edward G. Robin-
son, and Lionel Barrymore The
plot involves a returning war
veteran who lights gangsters in the
Florida Keys. Edward G. Robinson
is the relentless bad guy and Hume
phrey Bogart is the war veteran
who realizes that being good is not
enough. It's all supposed to say
something about the post-war
human condition, but we might as
well just watch it for Bacall and
Bogey getting mucky in swamps.
Good action finale.

years during which they are
frozen, technology will develop to
the point where they can live a
healthy, happy lite. But what about
the world of the future that they
will enter? Woody Allen explores
the humorous possibilities in his
motion picture, “Sleeper."

“Sleeper" is the third film that
Allen wrote and directed. It was
released in 1973 and marked the
beginning oi a long collaboration,
proiessional and personal, with
across Diane Keaton. Although the
iilm has a rather weak plot and
uses slapstick heavily, it is a
showcase oi Allen's greatest one-
liners.
