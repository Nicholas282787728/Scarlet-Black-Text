Chair details salary increases

by Jessica Weisel

Outgoing Chairman of the
Faculty Don Smith presented his
1987438 annual report at a recent
meeting of the Grinnell College
faculty, before turning the job
over to Theatre Professor Sandy
Moffett.

The report details faculty
salaries for the 1988789 academic
year. and compares 1987488
Grinnell salaries to those of nine
other colleges, This listing
shows that in average salary of
the ten schools, professors at
Grinnell rank eighth, associate
professors rank tenth, while
assistant professors rank seventh.

Salaries for prolcssors average
$50,300. a 51,800 increase over
the 1987-88 sum. Also. the av-
erage associate professor salary
increased $2,900, assistant pro-
fessor salary increased $2,100,
and instructor salary increased
$2,500 over the past year.

These salary increases capped
a three-year plan of the Budget
Committee to raise faculty
salaries to a competitive level.
Now, a new plan will have to be
devised for future salaries. which
Moffctt called, "Beginning on
ground one." One consideration
will be to raise the associate pro-
fessor salary out of tenth place on
the ranking. To do this, less
dramatic increases will be given
to assistant professors and my
eructors. Smith warns against

 

Don Smith, former Faculty Chair

cutting the average assistant pre-
fessor‘s salary, because the colr
lcge will once again "be in the

, league‘s cellar."

Besides current faculty
salaries, Smith also maintains
that the college must "give un-
remitting attention In the level of
starting salaries for the purpose
of faculty recruitment."
Competition for new professors
is "intensifying." That .Grinnell

has increased junior-faculty
salaries is "not an excuse for
complacency."

Moffett agreed with the re»
port, claiming, "I have no quar»
rcls for What (Smith) has begun."
lIe intends to work to maintain
competitive salary levels, He will
also continue Smith‘s efforts to
assist faculty research, in funding
and in time allowances Moffett
explained, "A faculty research

program here would not be done
to further our own careers or to
raise our status in our profes-
sions. but to make us better
teachers."

The report also addresses the
college curriculum‘ Smith
comments on the difficulty the
Curriculum Committee has in
addressing curricular issues, bcr
cause of student response against
a perceived "core curriculum."
Moffctt believes this has hamr
pcred cun‘iculum reviews, because
the faculty hasn't, "in a system-
atic way, I think, reconsidered the
curriculum in the past few years.
We've done it, but it's been in a
kind of haphazard. ad hoc way."

Other issues raised in the re-
port include the need for a
"comprehensive look" at faculty
health insurance and the creation
of faculty directories in ARI-l,
Carnegie and Steiner.

Kesho Scott wins American Book Award

 

 

by Jessica Weiscl

Kesho Scott. lecturer in soci-
ology at Grinnell College. was
named a 1988 recipient of the
prestigious American Book
Award. The Before Columbus
Foundation presented the award to
Scott and co-authors Cherry
Muhanji and Egyirba High for
their collaborative work Tight
Spaces.

Tight Space: is a series of
autobiographical short stories by
the three women. Stemming
from o of Scott's graduate
school gnments, the book
details the tight spaces" occupied
not only be the authors, but by
wotncn everywhere.

Scott explained that while
confined, tltc “space is a place
where we name ourselves, we do
our political work, and we bc.
We do our creative work (there),

 

 

 

It's not as bad as people would
assume."

When she received notifica-
tion of the award last March,
Scott thought it was "some kind
of practicaljoke." Instead. "Tight
Spaces" joined 12 other books,
including works by Toni Morri-
son and actor Steve Allen. as re
eipicnts. Scott and her coauthors
were the only ﬁrsHimc novelists
to win the award.

Scott admits that she
underestimated the prestige of Ihc
award, which she now likens to
an "Academy Award for books."

Scott intends to continue
writing. Currently. she writes
three days a Week and teaches on
the other two. l'ler dissertation is
nominated for two college awards
from the University of town and
is scheduled for publication.

 

"My writing, for me, primar»
ily is going to be autobiographi~
cal, continuing in short stories
and also, I'm going to move into
other mediums like screenplay
and/or television."

At some point in the future,
Scott intends to write full time.
For now, though, she plans on
balancing writing and teaching
She hopes that the college will
offer her a tenure Lract position
"that can use (her) skills and tat
enls."

Still, Scott is watchful for
any new developments, such as a
possible play or movie transiti-
tion of the book. The success of
"Tight Spaces" has not yct sunk
in. As her first novel enter. its
third printing, writing remains an
opportunity for her to "come out
of the closet."

 

 

Lincoln
answers
ﬁnance
questions

By Barbara Brown

"The purpose of this session
is to provide returning students,
faculty, and staff with informa-
tion regarding recent changes in
the federal financial-aid regula-
tions, and the results and adjust-
ments that have been made in
Grinnell College Office of SluV
dent Financial Aid (GCOSFA)
procedures," said director of stur
dent financial aid James Lincoln
in his opening comments in
South Lounge Monday night.

The changes in GCOSFA
procedures result from the Higher
Education Amendments of 1986,
which were signed into law by
Ronald Reagan on October 17,
1986 and revaulhorized the Higher
Education Actof1965.

The amendments affect
recipients of Pell Grants. Sup-
plemental Educational Opportur
nity Grants. National Direct Stu-
dents Loans, and Guaranteed Stu-
dent I/oans by making changes in
the duration of loans. maximum
amount of loans. and student elir
gibility for loans. They also
specify new need—analysis and
verification procedures lhal
GCOSFA must follow, and re
quire exit counseling for aid rc-
cipients.

In addition, The National Dir
rect Student Loan Program has
been renamed the Carl D.
Perkins Loan Program. and the
Guaranteed Student Loan Pro-
gram has been renamed the
Robert T. Stafford Student Loan
Program.

Although the information
Lincoln and his staff presented
was in some way applicable to
over 800 upperclassmen, fewer
than 20 people, faculty and staff
included, attended the meeting,
which was announced in an elec
tronic mail message. Monday’s
meeting was the "first of at least
two financial-aid sessions that we
will be holding during the 1988r
89 academic year," according to
Lincoln.

An underlying theme
throughout Lincoln's discussion
of financialraid procedures and
changes was the frustration
caused to GCOSFA by the federal
government's frequent changes in
and poor explanations of its fi-
nancialraid regulations. In refer
ence to regulations regarding
monitoring of students with
campus employment, Lincoln
made the comment, "You tell me
ifyou can understand it. i might

consltlcr hiring you in the
office."
