Two new faces in the Pioneer program

Cain should
spark spikers

in George Meiitnsey

The past two years have pro-
duced some changes in the Grinr
ncll College Athletic Depart-
ment. Several new coaches have
arrived, adding new ideas and en~
thusiasm to a fine athletic pro-
gram. or Lhesecoachcs, none is
more enthusiastic than Sheila
Cain who Wlii man the healm of
this year‘s Pioneer women's vole
leyball squad,

A native lowtin, Coach Cain
recently received her Masters dc-
grce from lowa State University
in Exercise Physiology. She
taught as a graduate assistant at
151} and also served as the assis-
tant swim coach at the uanCl’r
sity.

Cain has been working the
team hard for the past two weeks
as they prepare for the season
opener against Simpson on
September 6. "That match,"
Cain says. "will be a good point
to judge otir developments as
Simpson is one of the tougher
teams in the league."

Grinncll also looks to be very
tough as a core of six letterwinr
ncrs return to be joined by several
other experienecd and talented
players. The cohesiveness of the
team is obvious to both Cain and
the players. "They (the players)
are all playing to have fun and to
win. Everyone is working to-
ward the same goals," Cain
notes. She is echoed by senior

An enthusiastic
Coach Cain.

 

letterwinncr Donna Gleason who
recognizes that, "Unity in pracr
tiee is developing quickly."

The hard work, unity, and
enthusiasm of the Pioneer vol-
leyball team will come together
on the floor of Darby Gymna-
sium on September 6 at 7:00
pm. as they host Simpson.
Best of luck to the team and,
"Welcome to Grinnell Coach
Cain!"

Fresh attitude
for '88

by Bob Lifton

"Defense must come
first,.,.We've got to win wtth our
defense.“ This straightfoward,
down-to-carth philosophy is
stcrnly spoken by Greg Wallace,
the Pioneer‘s new head football
coach. lie flatly states these
words with a straight face, with-
out cracking one of those what-
ever-happensrhappcns looks. It
wasn't a half-ass, "standard"
coach's schpiel about the upcom-
ing season. either; this man is
committed to rebuilding this
program. And something tells
me that his players are getting
the message loud and clear. it is
this sound advice which they will
hopefully try and reiterate with
action oh the field.

This man from Kansas City.
Mo. brings with him plenty of
credentials. After graduating from
Missouri Valley College where
he palycd both football and base-
ball, Wallace coached football at
two high schools in the K. C.
area for seven years. After a brief
stint as receiver's coach at Indiana
Slate. he assumed the positions
of football offensive coordinator
as well as head baseball coach and
associate dean of students at
Centre College in Kentucky.
Centre is an academically-ort-
ented, division three liberal arts
college much like Grinnell, hence
Wallace‘s immediate attraction to
the Pioneer program.

"I’m accustomed to working
with a different type of student.
It's a challenge competing against
different schools which have
lower academic stan-
dards....Furthcr, the facilities here
at Grinnell are extremely good."

Throughout his tcnryear stay
at Centre, Wallace helped develop
their athletic program into a first-
rate system. For the past three
years, for instance, both the
football team and men's basket—
ball team captured consecutive
conference championships.
Needless to say, such a winning
tradition -— which
even the division one power
houses would marvel at -- would
be more than welcome here in
cornfield country. Coach Wal-
lace, however, is well aware of
the fact that overnight successes
are both few and far between.

" Progression Year"

"This year will be a progres-
sion year. If we can take it game
by game, week by week, we have
a chance at a successful season."

 

 

Football Coach
Greg Wallace.

No longeterm plans, no midrsear
sen goals etched in stone, Just
progression, plain and simple.

From what he's seen thus far,
Wallace is pleased with his new
squad. In particular he cites the
advantage of having a strong
freshmen class, thanks, in part,
to the diligent off-season work of
his four captains (Jim Weiand,
Rob Boardman, Wallace Squibb
and Paul Manlernach) who talked
to prospectives. Moreover. the
coach points to the often over-
looked quality which intelligence
plays on the field and how much
it will enhance his ballelub.

While defense is what Wal-
lace is so adamently stressing, he
will naturally bring some of his
offensive plays from his days at
Centre. "At Centre we were pre—
dominently a runroricnted ball—
club. This along with what my-
self, coach Gilbert and the offen-
sive coordinator develop will
comprise our offense. But we
won‘t be afraid to put the ball in
the air. (Quarterback) Wciand is
deﬁnitely
throwing the ball well."

His offense will finally get a
chance to strut their stuff come
September 10 up in Concordia,
Minnesota. After a week lay»
over, the Pioneers will have their
first home game on the 24th
against Iowa Wesleyan. Don’t
miss this opportunity to catch
the newly revamped Pioneers.
under the keen direction of
coach Greg Wallace.
