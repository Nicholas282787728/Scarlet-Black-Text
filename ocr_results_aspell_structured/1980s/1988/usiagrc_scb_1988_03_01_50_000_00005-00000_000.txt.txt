My campaign promises and
goals are very realistic, There are
foundations that do endow dif-
ferent programs ior college cams
puses. One of my other campus
promises was to have son raising
money ior themselves »I want to

Set-up a'mutual fund, That's Very‘

realistic/'Wh'ether‘ it's phonathon
or ‘maybe' it‘s alumni raising
money for SGA. that's very
realistic I'd like to see us have
more control over our own affairs.
if ive run out of money and go back
to the administration, they have
their own problems. l've seen the
attitude that since this is a very
ivealthy school. it we have pro
blems we just go ask tor the
money. Well, who’s to say that we
shouldn't be able to raise our own
money? l think that it's very
realistic that we can have an SGA
phonathon. i think the iaculty and
administration would be more in
favor of that than they would not in
favor of it. There would be a lot of
details to work out about that. but
I'm sure we Could Come to some
agreement, because they do have
their own phonathon, but I think
there would be more interest in
thatv’phonathon-if students thought
they were getting something out oi
it That's'something I think I could
promise the administration and
iaculty, that we wouldn't lake
away that much irom their
phonathon, 1 would really like to
get some assets ior SGA and have
that set up. Campus unity. that is
very much a reality, Yes, we have
SGA senators. but yes. ive also had
to beg ior SGA senators this
semester, There were some dorms
where when you came to have elec-
tions, they didn't have an SGA
senator, it's more like begging at
thelast moment tor SGA senators.
Why is it that they ieel they
shouldn't even be a part oi this
organization? Are they not being
represented? Let's get down and
let's talk to these different
organizations Maybe not all the
students want to be a member of
SGA. You can't get everybody ln'
terested in politics. but there are
groups that would probably ivant
to be interested In SGA that don't
feel represented. and they ice} that
they have problems. it the iootball
team saw that GCGC's at the foot-
ball game. maybe it would offend
some people that GCGC's at the
football game, but there are some
people that are very openrminded
on the football team. and I think
the divisions on this campus cause
more phobias than anything. i
iigure ii we get GCGC out there.
yeah. there are going to be some
people that are going to be so plss~
ed on that they gay people are
coming to the game, but there are
going to be those people who say.
"This is great that they’re in
terested in football and they're not
all running around, iashion
designers or something." Get peor
ple seeing each other.

Brad Sheridan

I know they're Very realistic. I
did some research, talking to some
other people and iinding out if
these things are possible. i know
that if I can't, I can push and have
other people help me. but i know
that they're very possible goals
that I've set.

Dave steinimiii

in my statement i didn't really
make any rash promises because
one thing I've learned in my time
in SGA is that so much of it is hav-
ing ideas, taking them to the peo-
ple, and having the ideas changed.
Compromise is the big word as
SGA President dealing with the
faculty and administration and the
PEG people. You can't say ‘I'm gor
ing to do this and this' because
there are so many obstacles to
overcome. You're going to have to
realize that there are going to bc

Presidential Interviews

compromises you have to make.
It's a line balance You've got to
know what you want to get across
and you can‘t let the aﬂmll’liSlia'
tion and iaculty totally disregard
what you've got to say It’s a fine
line that you have to tread, I really
think that a candidate who goes in
to it with all oi these big plans will
be sorely disappointed.

How much experience do
you have in dealing with the
faculty and administration?

Pleshettc Ilnlnb .

I have a whole lot of experience
dealing with them. I was chairper-
son of the Black Student Task
Force and was the liaison between
the administration and the black
Students. I’m a Student advisor, so
I have Contact with them with stu»
{lent issues and student life. I'm
currently a student assistant in
minority recruitment, so i have a
lot of contact With admissions.
faculty, and also President Drake
and Waldo Walker. I'm a member
and founder of Coalition for
Awareness Unity and Social
Equality, which was a group that
iormed out oi the Speakeasy, That
group is a liaison ior all the camr
pus organizations that are lighting
tor something, and the administra-
tion. All in all, We had a lot of con
tact With them, I know a lot of
tacully members by first names
and they know me. When they see
me across campus they speak with
me. and it's not just “Hello,” it‘s
"Hello, Pleshettc.” I think that's
very important when you‘re work-
ing with them to be able to have a
relationship that you can comr
municate and they know you by
name. by lace, and they know ivhat
concerns you are associated with

Paul Froese

I‘ve taken classes on this camr
pus and they are taught by iaculty.
Therefore, I have interaction with
the iaculty daily. The other day i
saw a speaker on campus and
George Drake was there and he
said ”hi" to me and we talked a lit
tle bit. That's my only real ex-
posure to administration but I'm
sure it would grow ii i was presir
dent.

Greg Evans

Considerable experience. I've
met on an individual basis with
members of the administration
and the faculty before. I've met
with Jim Tederman several times
this year about the phone system,
arranging it so students know
more about that. The deans' lun-
cheons that I've had with Tom
Crady and Diane Dougherty have
put me in close contact with those
I helped arrange a house, which
also put me in close contact with
Diane Daugherty. I'm meeting
With Dee Fairchild about the PEG
on Monday, and last year i dealt
with George Drake with some
more personal issues, some issues
that a lot of the campus didn’t
know about, with the films and con.
certs,

Dianna Ward

This year i have more. Last
year, as a ireshman, i didn't have
that much experience. but that's
irrelevant, This year, on individual
levels l've had a lot oi contact with
faculty and administration.
members of diiierent boards, peo-
ple that t know and can talk to, peo
ple that think like I do on ideas and
are willing to go out on a
limb , I've talked to Wally Walker
about various things I see, and l'vc
worked closely with Steven Jones.
I could go on and on. When 1 go
these people i have ideas to take
them. i don't say, "You guys have
done this to me." I say, "You have
a meeting coming up. Could you
bring this up?" Not. “Hey. ive need

more black faculty." l've had a lot
oi experience on that level. l also
have buddy relationships with
these people, which makes it a
more relaxed atmosphere. You get
more done with that type ol at-
mosphere.

Brad Sheridan

With administration. I have ex-
perience the last two and a half
years We been here being with at}
tivities committees, planning
events I think more importantly
I'm always over in Student Affairs
and I'm most familiar with the ad-
ministration there, talking to them
on a firstrname basis and shooting
the breeze We're really comforr
table around each other and it
makes for a good medium to get
my point across. l've dealtwith the
iaculty as a concerned student
about 'a grade or two. and as a
friend of a few of them. and in
study breaks, That's good ior the
whole school. to get everyone
together.

Dave Sleinman

l've dealt with the administra~
tion ior the last two years as assiSr
tant treasurer and treasurer in
having lunches. talking with Dee
Fairchild. talking with all the
deans oi students: Tederman,
Crady. Diane Doughterty. I know
and can deal ivith Wally Walker,
George Drake, There's no one in
the administration that i wouldn't
ieel comiortable going up and talk
ing to and knowing that i would be
an eltective representative oi the
students I really haven't had any
ties with the faculty. but that's
more in line with what the vice-
president does.

If there is an issue that is
popular among the students
but is impractical or
unrealistic what do you do?

Pleshette llaino

Compromise. i guess it all
depends on how impractical the
issue is. 1 can’t necessarily say tor
every speciiic thing that l'm going
to do that it will always turn both
ways. A compromise would be my
iirst answer, If a compromise
couldn't be sought then ,1 would
have to see what kind oi issue it is.
I can't say that I'm going to do it
this way or that way; i want to
know what the issue is and how
much the student body wants it or
is it just a little group oi people. i
would have to wait until i have the
issue at hand because they are all
different

Pull] Froese
To hell with it. If it‘s impractical.

Greg Evans

First oi all, students need to be
educated on all issues about what
is realistic and what is not, I think
aiter that is done about an issue,
we can step forward irom there to
take a more realistic possibility.
The 32 program is a good examr
ple. A lot oi people 7 students and
candidates — want to do something
about the 32. But at this point the
most we can probably do is try to
influence how the faculty im-
plements this, and inlluence the
treasurer in the future to get more
iaculty, As far as this year, though.
we need to cooperate with the
faculty and administration rather
than changing 32, because that’s
not going to happen.

Dianna Ward

Begging the trustees {or more
money right now is impossible, and
i realize that it's impossible. that
the trustees are just not going to
give any more money. My idea on
that is to offer alternative ideas
and sit down and brainstorm,.,.lt
might work, it might not work, but
it's an idea, and it’s better than

saying, ”Look what they've done to
us,” What can we do? That‘s my
attitude. what can we do to help? i
understand about financial mat-
ters with the trustees. We're not
poor. but we can't just touch this
money. I think thinking of solutions
to problems students see on this
campus ourselves. and then taking
them to the administration and
faculty and saying. “what do you
think about this? Do you have any
-irleas to add to it?" that's a better
way and maybe we'll get some
things volunteered to us.

Brad Sheridan

I'd definitely tell them about it i
know the S and B is probably the
best source for telling the students
what‘s going on, atleast asa mass,
I'd write. I don‘t know ii ltwould be
my own column .or an editorial,
and say. "though we have so much
support tor this, l've tried the best
that I can and it's Just not possible,
and I wouldn't be telling you this if
it was possible It's not like I'm
giving up, I tried my best." I'd also
tell them that I’m working toward
a compromise.

Dave Sieinman

I'd definitely talk with the ad»
ministration, see what I could do
about it. and if I can't do anythingI
would go back to the students and
tell them this is impractical, [or
whatever reasons given by the ad-
ministration.

Then I'd look for another way to
go about it, maybe a compromise,
it depends upon the situation.

If you were appointing
people to cabinet positions,
what kind of people would
you look for?

Pleshelte iiamb

First and ioremost. I would look
ior experience, Not necessarily in
SGA, but what other student-body
organizations they’ve participated
in. Secondly i would look at not
personalities but how they relate to
other people and how well they can
talk to other people. And thirdly, i
probably would do something like
with the student-advisor positions.
When you're going through that
process you sit around with a
group of people and you propose
situations and see how they react
and deal with the situations. I think
that the cabinet members should
be a representation of the student
body, and not just personal friends.
Putting personalities and personal
preferences aside, I want to have
people in the cabinet who are going
to get the job done most eiiiciently,
effective ior the students and not
for themselves,

Paul Froese

Friends, people willing to pay ior
the position. and people willing to
do favors ior me.

Greg Evans

1 would look ior number one,
motivated people who can
motivate others. Number two, peo-
ple who could work constructively
with the cabinet. 1 reel that there's
a problem this year with working
together. And three. 1 would look
ior people with expertise in the
area

Dianna Wuril

i think that would cause a lot of
confusion because 7 I don't want
to point the iinger at anyone a
when someone's elected they ap-
point a whole cabinet iull oi their
friends. I don't know if that's
always wise. Yes, they do inter-
view people. but it turns out the
same way. i haven't had a problem
finding people who really want to
work or telling people. “I like you
because you want to work,” My
cabinet would be much different, It
would be full oi people that want to

Page 5

get things done, goaloriented peo-
ple and people who had time to put
towards those goals and not the
people who were bogging
themselves down with a lot of dii-
icrent stuff or people i have seen
on this campus that just do a lot. I
want people that are involved. 1
want people that are going to work.
lwant hard workers. 1 wantpeople
who have creative ideas, 1 think
it's healthy to have some disagree-
ment, to bring it irom all
segments. 1 don't see the Campus
Republicans represented at all on
campus, 1 would like to see very
qualified people in the cabinet,
very goal-oriented, and ii that
means that it's a member oi Cam»
pus Republicans, then it'll be a
member oi Campus Republicans,
If that means it's a member oi
GCGCs, then it'll be a member oi
GCGC Whether they're a iriend or
mine or not.

Brad Sheridan

The tirst thing i would look ior 7
in the president oi the United
States, and I would look ior it here
— is honesty and trust. If it's so-
meone that I trust, ii they say
they're going to do something, i
have to truly believe they're going
to do it and ability goes in there,
too li it's a films committee and
the person doesn't know very much
about movies, even though he's a
trusted friend or something, i
couldn't do that to the campus. 1
think we need someone in there
who‘s experienced and knows
what's out there.

Dave Steinman

l'd definitely look ior people i
could work with, You're not going
to get anything done in cabinet ii
you can't get along with the people,
l'd also look ior people who have
been involved in SGA in the past.
That's really key, There's a whole
lot oi red tape involved and you
could waste half a semester just
having people learn the jobs. So
that's the most important, eXr
perience and people i can work
with.

What do you think will be
your most important
cabinet appointment?

Pleshette liamh

Probably social coordinator.
because a lot or the things that ai-
fect the student body come across
that desk. With planning parties,
getting Gardner reserved and Her
tor's reserved, to me that's one of
the more important positions
because that's the more visible
position that the student body
knows about. .

Paul Froese

i don't really know what the
question means. i don't know
who's in the cabinet or what goes
on, so basically when i get in I'll
just houserclean and bring in all oi
my iriends. My most important ap-
pointment? Food committee, i
guess,

Greg Evans
Right now we, the present
cabinet. are trying to appoint a
director of periorming arts, a new
cabinet position, I feel that this
position will be one oi the more in
fluential cabinet positions and a
new position, so it will be very im-
portant that this person be a
motivated, working person,

Dianna Ward

Considering my platform is has
ed on the money side oi everything,
iundraising, I think the appoint-
ment oi treasurer will be the big
gest appointment, because I want
someone who knows a lot about.
where we can hnd funds and has
creative ideas, someone who
knows a lot about money and
