‘—Letter Polic

Letters to the editor are a very important aspect of our
newspaper. However, there are ground rules which must be
followed to ensure that letters are in the best interests of all

parties concerned

We encourage letters and will prim them intact as soon as
time and space permit. Letters in poor taste, judged to be
libelous or not following the guidelines will not be published

Letters must be signed when they are submitted for
publications Names will be withheld upon request only in

very rare instances. If it is clear that printing a name will
jeopardize someone's employment or personal well-being, then
they will be withheld. We will print an anonymous letter
only after consulting with the author.

The deadline for letters is midnight the Tuesday before
publication. Letters must be submitted either via the Vax
system (tell Scarlet) or through campus mail (typed).

 

Against the Grain

"Dear Mom"

"Dear Mom,"

This is, of course, not a real
letter home, but I wonder how
my parents would react if they
were to receive it. I wonder how
many freshman parents did re
ceive this letter.

Hi, how are things going
with you, Dad and Todd,

School's been going just swell.

It seems like only yesterday I was
going through the Grinnell
Vicwbook, telling myself how
great things would be back here.
The year just seems to be flying
by. I am sorry I haven't written
to you yet, but hopefully this
letter can tell you about the first
few weeks of this ycarr

It's been a good year so far.
The groups on campus are really
active. The Gay and Lesbian A17
liance (sounds sort of violent) has
been meeting regularly, as far as I
know they were only attacked
once by the townies (that's what
we all call the locals back here).
The police were very helpful.
From what I understand, they
were even willing to accept the
license number of the people who
did it. Grinnell is such a big
town though, I can see why nicy
are having such trouble apprcr
hcnding the people responsible.

There has only been one rape
so far. Some townie was actu
ally dumb enough to go walking
at night unarmed. Just asking for
it. Geez. everybody knows you
don't go outside when it's dark
unless you have a highly visible
ﬁrearm to deter criminals.

The campus looks great. The
redwood railing in front of my
dorm only gets broken once a
week. The ceiling was destroyed
on our floor, but only once. and
only one door has had the glass
it ok it, The have these

really great campus maps that
everybody gets to write on. It is
always a pleasure to read the
witty comments of others.

The townspeople really love
college students. They whistle
and shout at all the girls as they
drive by in their nifty Cameros
and Firebirds. Boy, those things
sure can make noise! They show
us how much noise they can
make as they drive by the street
next to my dorm. They are really
considerate, too: they know I am
usually not in until later. so they
wait until 1 as m. or so to drive
by. They are soooo nice, staying
up that late just for me.

The food is really good too.
Although I don't know about
breakfast because I haven't made
it yet this year.

The best part of all is that the
president wants to review the
curriculum, and maybe we will
even get some distribution re-
quirements! That was the only
thing that really turned me off to
Grinnell. Why couldn't they
have required courses like all
those colleges to which I didn't
apply? Even better is that if we
get a core curriculum all the
magazines will rate us higher!
We already have the highest on
dowmcnt per student of any
school anywhere, which makes
us clearly superior. Oh. by the
way, they say they may have to
raise tuition again next year.
One other unfortunate note is that
part of my class building could
really use some air conditioning
and new heating facilities. The
library needs more books and the
grounds need some help. All of
this is insignificant, though, bee
cause of the good news about the
endowment.

Well, I guess I'll write to you
later and tell you how the second
month of school is going

 

 

Some Grinnell Seniors do Lust,
Others in homework put trust,

But as for we four

We're rigllt out the door,
\Cause it's Cape Canaveral or Bust!

See you next week

y— PSN hopes to construct

"realistic" view of the CIA

To the Editor:

One moment of last Sunday's
presidential debate deserves spe»
cial attention by Grinnell stu»
dents, In the context of one of
his answers, Vice President Bush
made several references to na-
tional security and his desire not
to say anything which might
harm it. This is apparently his
subtle way of tuming the contro-
versy now surrounding Jim
Wright into an election issue.
He is not the first to do it. Ever
since Wright revealed the facts
about CIA involvement with
anti-government demonstrators in
Nicaragua. Republicans have
been trying to attach this stigma
to democrats in hopes of hurting
the Dukakis campaign. Now,
tired of the Pledge of Allegiance,
Bush has joined the fray.

Speaker Wright’s comments
paint an interesting picture. Due

to the overwhelming‘popular
support of the Sandinistas. the
Reagan administration had cone
tinually failed to make any
progress toward overthrowing
them. This put them in an vul-
nerable political position at
home. It was rapidly becoming
apparent to the congress that
Nicaragua was not controlled by
an oppressive regimer To remedy
this, the CIA resorted to staging
demonstrations to make Ortega
appear repressive Simply put,
the CIA maliciously interfered
with the internal affairs of a
sovereign nation to support our
government's "interests."

These revelations mean two
things to Grinnell students.
First, it is one more example ofa
nonrlssue being raised in the
presidential campaign. Even if
Wright's information was previ-
ously unpublished. our national

Environmental Issues

A Hand Among the

"Where's the beef?"

Maybe the old folks in the
Wendy‘s commercial can't ﬁnd it.
But the catchy query is really a
contradiction of eating habits in
the United States. In this coun-
t1'y.poople eat an average of no
kilograms (242 pounds) of meat
per year, about onc»third of it
beef.

The question is pertinent in
the United Smtcs, but it should
also be asked in developing na-
tionsr Worldwide, domestic anir
mals use six billion hectares of
land, or almost half of the
planet's ice-free surface. Ali
though thirdrworld nations pos~
sess over 60 percent of this live-
stock, people in these countries
enjoy only 20 percent of all the
meat and milk produced. The rest
is exported to affluent,
"developed" areas of the world.
The average Costa Rican cats 13
kilograms (28 pounds) ofbccfpcr
year (about onerthird that of the
average U. s. citizen). The av-
erage U. S. cat cars more.

More importantly, what does
beef production do to the counr
tries that export to the United
States? One of the most severe
problems is in Latin America,
which contributes about onc-
sixth of our importctl beef. Foulr
fifths of that comes from Central
America, a region composed of
Guatemala, Honduras, El Sale
vndor, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
Bell/.c.

Since 1960, this area has 10st
over thrcc-quartcrs 01 IL forests
as lilL‘ land is converted to pus-

 

ture. Most of the subsequent
beet produced has gone to the
United States, where imports
have more than doubled since the
mid-fifties, A main motivation
for companies to import beef
from Central America is that the
cheap supply reduces hamburger

costs to consumers by five cents
each.

To supply us with cheaper
hamburgers, Central American
nations don't just sacrifice their
forests Deforestation leads to
siltation of reservoirs and rivers,
drier regional climates, and the
loss of thousands of potentially
valuable species of plants and
animals. An estimated six mile
lion hectares are lost each year to
deserts, due to land mismanage-
mcnt like that often involved in
raising cattle, In addition, the
pesticides used for pastures cone
laminate the environment as well
as the beef itself. Land cleared
from the forests is also poor in
nutrients and is soon abandoned
for newly deforested areas.

But beef production isn't just a
third-world problem. In the
United States, beef cattle con-
sume enormous amounts of our
orgy and food. For instance. over
half of the water that is used in
this nation goes into livestock
production. In part, this im-
mcnse consumption of resources
stems from the inefficiency of
beef cattle in converting plants
into mcdt. On the average, one
calorie ofgrain-fod steak costs at
least ten calories in its produc-
tion. In addition, a pound of this
steak Costs 2500 gallons of war
icr. the energy equivalent of a
gallon of gasoline, and 55 pounds
of eroded topsoil. Pigs, chicken,
and fish are more than twtcc us

 

security does not depend as m h
on secrecy as it does on the willy
ingness of our citizens and repre-
scntatives to stand up for what
they believe in. We urge stu-
dents to look beyond the rhetoric
in selecting who to vote for.
Second, the CIA does recruit on
campus. This latest incident is
only one in a long line of infrac»
tions by the agency. It was also
revealed recently that the CIA had
engaged in domestic lobbying and
dis—information in connection
with Contra aid. Progressive
Student Network intends to be
present when the CIA does come
to Grinnell so that all sides, not
just what the recruiters would ,
have you think, can be heard.
We hope the Grinnell community
will join us in constructing a
more realistic View of what the '
CIA does. Progressive Stu-

efficient as cattle at converting
calories. .

The most efficient foods,
however, are those where no an-
imals are involved: the grains
themselves. In an extreme case
in southern Mexico. ranchers
typically harvest 22 pounds of
meat per hectare annually. Each
year, neighboring farmers gather
up to 13,000 pounds of shelled
corn and 10,000 pounds of root
and vcgcublc crops per hectare.
Although this example may not
be typical, it emphasizes the
higher efficiency of vegetable
food production.

is it possible to reduce beef
consumption in the U.S.7 A
first step might be to do away
with Ihe fast-food factories that
line our travel routes. Burger
King. lack in the Box and Roy
Rogers have admitted to using
Central American beef in thclr
burgers, and McDonald’s has been
rcportcd to use it, too (although
the company says it uses "100%
US. BEEF ONLY"). Reducing
home consumption of beef, too.
can help reduce environmental
damage and cncrgy usc, and white
meat or vegetable altcrnativcs are
also healthier and less fattening.

The United States has long
feasted off of exploitation of do
voloping nations. and our bccf
supply is no exception. But no
can wean ourselves of [his
dependence on tropical rtttnl‘orcst
destruction, and even begin to
wean ourselves ofour dependence
on the higllrcncrgy beef cow,

Instead of “Where. the
bccl7,“ we should be asking
"Where's the tofu?“
