Students Become

Professionals

the recent Supreme Court decision in ltazelwood School District vs. ltulrneier has
caused many Americans to scream bloody murder over what they feel was a gross
ahridgement ot student journalists’ constitutional rights. Their argument goes
something like this: "By allowing a high-school principal to censor articles train the
student newspaper, the First-Amendment guarantee ol freedom of speech or of the
press has been denied these students. In essence, they have been told that they are
not granted the same liberties and freedom that our toretathers gave to professional
journalists."

that has not happened. In tact, the Court's decision gave the students a liberty
that had previously been in question — the right to act as prolessionals As many
people have said over the years, freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.
Reporters, whether they work on a school newspaper or a "real newspaper,"
ultimately have to answer to their publisher, It the publisher wants to edit a story or
to omit the whole thing, she or he has that right. In high school, the publisher is the
school board and administration.

This decision should not be misunderstood as some sort ot ethical pronouncement
that gives principals unlimited powers of censorship. It is not even a question of
ethics The Court did not laud the Hazelwood principal for having the line judgment
to edit those particular articles. It just acknowledged his right to do so given his
position

While the decision is definitely a lair one, it may cause problems tor many student
journalists in the luture. Some principals could use this case as a shield in their
battle to bar the schoolhouse doors against the onslaught of controversy. However, it
is the job of journalists to keep that from happening.

the Bill of Rights promises all Americans their freedom of speech and ot ple§.
The Supreme Court has held that promise and reassured student journalists that
they will he treated like their professional counterparts. Unfortunately for the
students, the Court has done the same tor the school administration.

To the editor:

The 1987 football season —What
was it all about”! It. was about a
group of guys working together
towards a common goal. it was
about learning to press on against
adversity and sometima insur-
mountable odds. returning to
challenging practices each and
every week. It was about having
faith in ourselves and the athletic
abilities we had cultivated
throughout years of playing a sport.
we’all loved, it was about having
pride in our school and playing
every game knowing we were
representing that school. it was
about having inn and making
memories. But. most of all, the
1987 football season was about
friendship and mutual respect
among a group of people, Not just
among the players themselves. but
also among managers, coaches,
trainers, fans, reierecs, tuwnspeo
ple, students, professors, and ad-
ministrators. Unfortunately, this
relationship, filled with tradition
and honor, is now being threaten
ed, for Grinnrll College may not
’ field a football team next year.
Many factors have contributed to
the slow demise ot a strong football
program at. Grinnell' lack of
players, lack of administrative
support, and an excess of negative
stereotypes, Just to namea few. All
students must. remain aware of the
issues affecting their fellow
students, whether they are black
students or gay students or student
athletes. Issues aftecting one
group of students affect all
students. because, when It comes
down to it, all prejudices,
stereotypes, beliefs, and interests
Set aside, we are all students at
Grinnell College first and
torernost. ii any program at Grlnr

The problem is this: Most and
hell students know little more than
the names and parties of the 13 ma
jor candidates. And even it they do
know more, it‘s doubttul they know
enough about ALL the candidates
to make an intelligent choice

Cial aid, or Quad's food. In order
for the ruotball program at Grin-
nell to survive, a firm commitment
must be given by the administra-
tion to improving and maintaining
the program, but this will not hap-
pen unless a significant number of
students want it to happen,

Football is a unique Sport in that
it requires large numbers of
talented people, There were four
freshmen on the Pioneer football
team this year. On a good game
day we were lucky it We suited as
players, with the loss of 12 seniors
our numbers have been reduced to
a little over 2|). Unless the team
receives at least 30 players next
year there is no way it will survive.
The administration has promised
to set up a search committee to
look for a new head coach
However, this will not be enough to
save. let alone improve. the mob
ball program. Coaches Mai-tinek
and Gilbert did a tremendous job
recruiting new lootball students
over the past years and the
chances are a new coach will not
be able to do any better.

No, the problems lacing the loot-
ball team lie deeper than in the
coaching staff and they have not
been caused by a lack of admitted

in 1937 51 applied, 35 were admit-

they stem from Grinnell's failure

accord with the NCAA‘s rules
regarding the recruitment of
athletes in Divisioan schools, Un-
fortunately, it seems that other
schools in our conference and
elsewhere are bending or. in some
cases, breaking these rules. it the
administration is aware of these
practices they must do something
to stop them, as well as trying to
think of new and creative ways to
attract quality football students to
Grinnell 7 perhaps a scholarship
given to students who show ex-
cellence in extracurricular ac-
tivities in high school. These
methods for attracting talented
students to Grinnell can apply not
only to football players, but to ac-
tors, musicians, poets, etc. This
would facilitate excellence in a
variety oi programs, as well as im~
proving the quality of Grinnell's
football program Interested alum»
ni could be recruited to
systematically aid in contacting
new talent. it the administration
and board of trustees are indeed in-
terested in improving the quality
of the education Grinnell provides,
they will not only improve the col-
lege‘s image. but also every facet
of the Grinnell experience.

We at Grinnell are all in-
divtduais. having dilterent tastes
and enjoying different things. But
that doesn't mean we can't back
each other up. This letter does not
intend to imply that everyone
should now blindly run out and sup
port every interest group on cam
pus. it does, however, encourage
students to take the time to become
aware of issues and help out it they
feel called to do so. Let's give footr
ball a lighting chance at Grinneil.
You never know 7 maybe bu some
brisk autumn Saturday you'll head
out to the football field to watch a
game and the stands will be empty,
To a number oi your iellow
students that's a sad thought. —
