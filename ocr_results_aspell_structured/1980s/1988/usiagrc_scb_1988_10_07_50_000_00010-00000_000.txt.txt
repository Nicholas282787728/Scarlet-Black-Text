Theatre dept. presents The Hairy Ape

by Seth Peterson

In honor of the 100th any
nivcrsary of playwright Eugene
O'Neill‘s birth, the theaLre de-
partment is presenting The Hairy
Ape, Oct. 640, in Flanagan
Arena Theatre and surrounding
areas of the Fine Ans building.
Director A.Si Moffett, professor
of theatre at Grinnell. commented
on the play as, "an interesting
play, in some ways naive, and
sort of crude in its conception and
writing." This seems to be
generally true of O'Neill's earlier
works, among which this play is
grouped.

O’Neill didn't begin writing
until he was 23: Prior to this he
had been acquiring varied experi»
endes all over the world, which
became the material for much of
his subsequent work. He returned
from these adventures at sea an
alcoholic and, there is specula-
tion, on opium addict. It was in
a sanatorium that he began writ-
ing prolificnlly.

The greatest impact on his
writing seems to have been Ger-
man Expressionism. However, an
intriguing combination of other
influences, including European
Realism and Naturalism is also
apparent. He was a follower of
Freud and there are significant
psycho-social implications in his
presentations of characters. In ad!
dition to the focus on the psyche,
there is a synthesis with more
general political and social ideas
throughout most of his plays.

The playwright never really
felt himself a part of society.
O'Neill became disenchanted with
traditional philosophy and reli-
gion and saw the world as "a
world adrift," in dire need of new
forms of faith and self-expres-
sion. He believed this to be a
pathetic situation

O'Neill's personal philosophy
is metaphorically expressed in
The Hairy Ape, which Moffett
believes is "at heart a play about
the notion of trying to belong
somewhere." The drama focuses
on Yank (played by Dan Sulli-
van), a massive brute who derives
his sense of purpose from stok—

ing coal on an ocean liner. Sum.
van believes the lower classes, of
which Yank is a member. are
"the foundation of society, ala
though their contribution is
largely unrecognized." Yank‘s
self-esteem is shattered by a
glance of repulsion from a
woman passenger, Mildred.
Suddenly aware that he is a misfit
and being exploited by the bour-
geoisie, Yank endeavors to rem-
edy society's ills. The play pro-
ceeds with Yank encountering
people on both extremes of the
social spectrum, in venues rang-
ing from 5th Avenue to a Jail
cell. In Lhe end, Yank is unsuc-
cessful in finding a place for
himself within society. How-
ever. one is left to speculate
whether or not he finally finds
relief with the caged apes: In
O'Neill‘s words, "perhaps the
hairy ape (in death) finally be-
longs" Sullivan expressed great
enthusiasm about his role as
Yank. since this is a play with
implications just as relevant to-
day as when it was written in
1921.

O'Neill is regarded as a highly
experimental playwright. Direc-
tor Moffett hopes to ”best main-
tain its flow of experimental-
