SCARLET AND BLACK

A Hand Among the Leaves

"Why are you a vegetar-
ian?"

The question was one I of-
ten asked of friends of mine who
lived a strange eating lifestyle of
quiche, cheese pizzas, and macro-
biotic restaurants. It seemed like
a fad to me, a thing to do to be
different, a triviality that really
didn't matter. T

Todd Francis

But vegetarianism is not a
fad, It is not done just to be dif-
ferent. And it is not trivial.

The most common or
meaninful justiﬁcations of vege-
tarianism can be subdivided into
three broad Categories, the first of
which is personal reasons. In
general, non-animal foods are
much healthier than animal
foods, which have much higher
saturated fat and cholesterol con-
tents. Today. people in the
United States get two-thirds of
their protein from animal
sources. This change from past
diets emphasizing plant sources
has led to increased incidences of
heart disease. cancer, and strokes.

Secondly, consumers con—
ccmcd about toxic and carcino-
genic additives complain about
the chemically-enhanced diets that
are fed to much of the livestock
in this country. The animals
concentrate such chemicals in
their tissues, and pass them on to
humans when they are slaughe
Iered for food.

A third reason for vegetari-
anism for personal reasons is that
consumers do not want to eat
meat if they feel that they Could
not kill the animal themselves.
This belief recognizes how iso~
latcd we are from animal slauglt»
ter and processing.

Number four: "I don't like
meat." -

The second class of reasons
for vegetarianism involves the
animals that are being consulncd.
and foremost among these is dis
satisfaction with how animals arc
raised for us to cal. Egg-laying
and broiler chickens, turkeys,
pigs, and bccf and dairy cattle are
generally raised in "food facto~

ries." (For detailed information
about the procedures involved
with each of these species, see
Animal Liberation by Pete
Singer.) These factories usually
involve mass crowding of aniv
maIs in cages. often hundreds of
thousands or millions in a com»
plex of buildings, and require in-
humane conditions to maximize
profit. Veal calves, for example,
are raised for up to ten weeks in
cages where they cannot turn
around or lie down with their legs
straight. They are kept in dark,
ncss most of the day. and are fed
anemic diets to keep their ﬂesh
white, Thus, the animals are
purposefully kcpl malnourished
to satisfy a demand for pale meat
color.

Philosophically, some
vegetarians also justify their eat-
ing habits with the argument that
all animals have the right to live.
Humans should consume only
plant matter, living the herbivo-
rous diet we supposedly have
evolved to eat.

Finally. environmental and
global reasons round out vegetar-
ian views on food, Some cone
sumers point to environmental
destruction, such as beef cattle
production that leads to
deforestation in Latin America.
and argue that vegetarianism will
stop or reduce such practices.

In a related issue, vegetar-
ian food comes from a lower
trophic level than meat, and thus
is a more effi 'ent use of the en—
ergy in the agricultural ecosys-
tem. Just as beef cattle use many
times their weight in grain to
produce bccf, so. too, do pigs,
chickens, turkeys, fish and other
animals (although Often in
slnallcr proportions). If we were
to eat lower on the food chain,
there would be more grain to feed
the hungry people of the world
today.

Furthermore, a smallcr
amount of non—rcncwablc rc~
sources. such as petrolcum,
natural gas, and coal, would be
needed if we cut out a level from
the food chain, since food facto-
ries arc vcry energy intensive.
High use of these energy sources

Two weeks after Fall Break
is not a bad place to be actually.
I have survived midtcnns, and the
guilt of not doing anything over
break has worn off. Much re»
mains to be done before finals,
but let me catch you up on what
has been done since my last up
date,

The trustees stopped bv to

say hello last weekend. One of
the trustees, Jack Han-is, laid out

over one million dollars for the- v

new student center scheduled for
construction in late May. Obvi-
ously, the name "Harris Center”
is an apt one for the building,
The trustees passed a proposal
worked out by Students to End
Apartheid (SEA) and the Board of
Trustees' Finance Committee for
more South African divestment.
I must commend those students
involved in that negotiation --
Great Job. Also, the trustees ap-
proved two more faculty posi-
tions for next year; the actual
budget is set in Fcbmary, but the
college can start looking for

leads to pollution and eventual
elimination of the resources.

Although vegetarians often
emphasize the absolute elimina-
tion of certain foods from con-
sumption. the most important
aspect of many of these reasons
is reduction rather than elimina-
Lion. Take for example Carney, a
meat addict who decides to reduce
her consumption of meat so that
she eats it every other day instead
of daily. Her friend Herb takes
the final step, and cuts out his
once a week meal of meat. Al-
though Herb is now the vecharA
ian. Carney has made a much
more significant step in terms of
reduction of energy use, animal
suffering, and environmental de—
struction because she has elimi-
nated so much meat from her
diet. The point is that there is too
much emphasis on absolute
vegetarianism versus dietary re»
structuring aimed at the same
goals.

For anyone who wants to
stop eating meat. finding protein
in eggs and dairy products is
generally not a problem. In fact,
of all foods, eggs have protein
content that is the closest to the
proportions we require. When all
animal foods are eliminated from
a diet, however, protein must be
balanced more carefully. using
combinations of legumes and
grains. in addition to seeds, nuts.
and potatoes. Furthermore, vi-
tamin and mineral sources must
be monitored to make sure that
one does not become malnour-
ished. Onc vitamin, B712, is
found only in animals. so the
vegetarian must either consume
an occasional egg or glass of
milk, or use bottled vitamins.

There are many books
available to the vegetarian. Laue
rel‘r Kitchen contains recipes.
information on dict, and lists of
food sources of all vitamins and
minerals. The Farm Vegetarian
Cookbook centers around soy-
beans, and uses no animal prod-
ucts in any of its recipes. More-
wilhrLcsr Cookbook is another
source of information on saving
resources and staying healthy.

"Choose Life"

I've got a nice volatile col-
umn for you this week, but be-
fore I start into it I would like to
congratulate those of you who
supported the grape boycott. I
understand that about 70 percent
of the students who voted (a little
more than a third of the total
student body) voted to approve
the boycott 1 was so depressed I

Mike Kent

had to go and reread page ﬁfty of
my student handbook. the part
where it says the cafeteria does
not participate in total boycotts
of any food item. Better luck
next time guys.

Now, for the part that is
sure to bring out the "I Hate
Mike Kent" tee-shirts.

Atlanta, GA. For those of
you who are unaware. pro-life
activists have recently held mas—
sive demonstrations ouBide of
abortion clinics in a movement
that is now called the "siege of
Atlanta". Pcrfect lead in to this
week's topic: Abortion.

I am pro-life. I estimate
that on this campus that pus me
in about a 1 percent minority,
alas. this would seem to be the
story of my life.

Why am I pro~life7 It
probably starts with a strongly
held belief that an unborn child is
a human being. Granted, they are
not able to process derivatives or
perform gymnastics, but every-
body was one at one time. Under
current laws, third trimester
abortions are illegal, while ﬁrst
and second trimester ones are not.
I think it is amazing that at mid-
night on the day the third
trimester begins. the unborn child
suddenly becomes a person. Why
are they viable then, yct hours
before they are a mere "blob of
flesh".

Now, how far does a per—
son’s right to control his/her own
body go? I feel a person should
have absolute control of lhcir
own body, but I also believe in
the old Cliche "your right to
swing your fist ends at the tip of
my nose." Since I believe that
the unborn child is a scparatc
human being, I don't think any-
one. parents included, has the
right to kill it. A parcnt that
kills an infant is sent to jail, a
parent that kills the same person
a few months earlier is "doing it
a favor by not bringing it into a
world of pain and poverty."

Now,l am not a woman. I
can't remember how many times
I have been reminded of this
when engaged in a discussion
about abonion. Let the lay it out
for you . ,.

In this world there are two
sexes, I did not make this deci-
sion, and nobody can do anything
to alter this situation. By some
twist of fate, in the reproductive
process of our species. one part:
ner becomes impregnated, the
other walks away, no worse for

wear. This is not fair. Nobody
gets to choose which they would
prefer to be, it's the flip of the
old coin. I will never become
pregnant, but that does not mean
that the opinion which I hold on
abortion is invalid. So please
don't tell me "you aren't a woman
so it‘s none of your business."
Books have been written on the
topic of abortion. and I can't
possibly cover all of the argue
ments in one column, so I'll try
and stick to general ideas.

A popular phrase in Ihe
pro»choicc movement of the early
seventies was "keep your morals
off my body." Very catchy in-
deed, and fundamentally correct I
don't seek to tell anyone what
they can or cannot do with their
own body. However. if you were
standing in your front yard, beat-
ing your child with a baseball
bat. I would very likely inter-
vcnc, Not that I would deny you
your god-given right to swing a
baseball hat. possibly pulling a
muscle in your arm, or spraining
your wrist. I say, more power to
you. I would, however, contend
that when your hat makes contact
with your child's head, your child
is being denied his or her rights
to the full control and enjoyment
of his or her body. Similarly.
your child did not ask to be con
ceivcd, but now that he or she
exists, he or she should be able
to expect some level of parental
support at least until he or she is
born. I am sure that if the child
had any alternative, it would not
choose to remain in the womb of
someone who did not wish it
there. but it hasn't got a lot of
options.

I have heard arguments in
the past regarding the cruelity of
bringing a child into a worid of
poverty. Surely. quote the pro-
choicers, it is more humane to
kill a blob of flesh than to let it
grow up in a ghetto, with noth»
ing more to look forward to in
life than dropping out of school,
becoming addicted to drugs, and
dying at age 22 anyway. To this
I respond, why not kill it when
it's twelve then? How about if
we wait until it drops out of
school. then we're sure it has no
chance of living a happy produce
Live lifc. How about if we wait
until it gets hooked on drugs?
Then we can be sure it will be
useless leech on society with ab-
solutely no human value
whatsoever, How about this. we
blow up the entire country of
Ethiopia, since they are poor and
unhappy and will eventually die
anyway.

This topic could go on for-
ever. and most likely will. I
can't possibly address every pos-
sible situation here, but if you
would like to discuss it further,
feel free to respond on the com-
puter. username (KENT). I
would be more than happy to go
deeper into the subject matter.
