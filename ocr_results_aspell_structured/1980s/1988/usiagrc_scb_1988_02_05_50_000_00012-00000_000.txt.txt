This is NOT going to be a sports
article with many statistics. The
reason is that too alien, in my epi-
nion, it's only the people who do
well in terms ol the standards of
the sport itselt who tend to get
mentioned in sports articles,
rather than the people who exert a
lot of effort but are not considered
"good.” True, the people who per»
term well deserve to be mentioned,

swim team attended the annual
two-day Coe Invitational in Cedar

Stevens Point. Needless to say, the
team left Coe, Northeast Missouri
State, Loras. Creighton, and Buena
Vista in their wake. Top scorers tor
Grinnell included Debbie Koa '91,
Shelly Avolio '38, Claire Hulchison
