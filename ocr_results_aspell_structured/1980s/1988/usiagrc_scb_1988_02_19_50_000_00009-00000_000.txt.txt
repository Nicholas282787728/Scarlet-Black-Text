Aesthetic decisions on this cam-
s have a major effect on campus
re. Obviously, these decisions
eate and atiect the physical en-
ironment or the college. But the
ecisions also create and affect the
oral environment of the college,

s indicative at a lack of care and
tention on the part or the people
charge.
The system of fait accompli
l cision-making at Grinnell has a
mg and ignoble history. One day
- the early 60s a young protessor
let’s call him George 7 was
ligently working in his oinee.
i es. life was hard and sometimes
e students were a pain, but they
so gave him joy. They were like
he children he had never had.
nyway, as he sat there, immers-
d in scholarly pursuit, he heard a
uge. rumbling, crashing sound. as
a building were being torn down.
nd what do you know, it was a

it campus, was being torn down to
nake way tor lovely Barber Plaza.
he building’s destruction came as
- complete surprise to George —
e was shocked, dismayed. that he
ad not been told. But, although he
all great anger. although his

world would never be the same
(for all his hopes and illusions con
cerning the college were shattered
the moment Blair Hall disap-
peared), he knew he had to work
for change. That change, however,
had to come through the system.
Alter all, we achieve true freedom‘
only when we accept limitations.
And, as he knew lrom his study oi
the architect Louis Sullivan. it just
doesn‘t do simply to create works
of genius without trying to get
along with the good old boys, As 507
meone once asked, “What would
they say on the gall course, or at
the country club? "

George later joined the board of
trustees. But. strangely,
thoughtless decisions continued to
pop up, such as when the college
decided to tear down a house it had
been given at the corner of 5th and
Park. Immediately alter it had
been given the house, the college
simply tore it down. lmagine the
pain ot seeing the destruction of
your former home. The lawn you
mowed, the windows that once
(rained a pleasant evening at home
~ all that destroyed by the
wrecker’s ball. And for what
reason? None,

Those are past Grinnell deci-
sions. But what do the recent logo
and landscaping decisions say
about the possibility for positive
change? Not much, Most decisions
are still made in dictatorial

fashion. A student leaves for the
summer, and returns to find a note
terribly-pleasing grouping oi ce
merit benches outside of Main
Lounger It doesn't match the ar»
chitecture of the dorms. Old
fashioned wooden benches set on
the grass would have been much
more stylistically appropriate (as
well as less expenswe), out what
can one do? It's there, Boom, Oh’,
well,

Atter having made really big
decisions, the college sometimes
chooses to “introduce” the deci-
sions (by then inevitable) to the
campus community, Often, the
talks are an insult to our in
telligence. When the logo was
decided on, some slick getterrand-
spender PR-man-type presented a
slide show. He repeated 3 bunch of

pseudo-scientific crap to justiiy the.

upwith a logo that, yes, even Vin-
cent Prosser could have come up
with. He said, “We’ve decided to
go with the color red because the
college has built up a definite
recognition-{actor in the color red,
true recognitioniactor equity.
This redness equity is very impor-
tant to recognition of the college.
Also, we decided to place a bar
over the logo because it says
‘strong.’ We've conducted inten-
sive studies and have tound that a
bar over the logo deiinitely says

Why hire a deadbeat like Milton
Glaser when you could have this
guy? As i sat there, warmed by my
thoughts, some proicssor turned to
an administrator (who has Since

grounds) and asked, “Hey was
that ﬁgure quoted in the S and B
right?”,The adminisﬂ‘ator replied,
“Why, they're not even close.
(Chuckle-chuckle. Har-har. ) "

As usual we’re being played ior
chumps. Our college, awash in
cronyism, does everything in what
can only be called a sneaky man-
ner, Are the decisions that result
any good? Well, theresults are im-
provements. But they're not what
they could be. For example. rather
than-creating a really attractive
environment. die college seems to
equate regular mopping oi the log-
gia with having a t'irstrate cam-
pus. ,

The new campus landscaping
plan is conceived along the same
lines. Basically. it simply amounts
to housekeeping. Aesthetically unr
successlul areas such as the
hideous, misplaced monolith of a
planter in iront or the new science
wing will be leit as is. The Ankeny,
lowa, firm or Snyder and
Associates will prune, replant, and
rearrange, but not much else. The
pruning will result in “open
