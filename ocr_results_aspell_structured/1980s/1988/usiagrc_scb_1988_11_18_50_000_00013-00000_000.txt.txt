Full Metal Jacket
‘ a disappointment

by Brian Strause

Throughout Full Metal
Jacket the Vietnam War is
characterized as "a big shit sand-
wich," aphtase which also serves
as a valid analysis of the film,
but thanks to the freedom our
soldiers so valiantly fought for
you have the right not "to take a
bite." Directed by Stanley
Kubrick (Dr. Strangelove, The
Shining, and 2001 -- A Space
Odyssey). this ﬁlm represents his
worst project to date. Tackling a
topic that is chock lull of dra-
matic and critical opportunity,
Kubrick suprisingly rcstrains
himself by relying on cliches and
poorly worked statements. Per—
haps while living in London,
Kubrick had distanced himself so
far from the American main-
stream that he thought bumper

R sticker slogans and cineamatically
overused Marine lingo would ﬂy.
Instead this attempt at film lays
motionless in the viewer's mind,

' with hardly a twitch. Sure, a few
dashes of melodrama. including a
bullet through "Gomer Pyle‘s"
head, will make some claw at
their chairs. but this brand of
drama is ultimately cheap and

' pseudo—emotional.

The first half of the film
follows a platoon of Marines
through bootcamp at Paris Island,
South Carolina. Based in cine-
matic legend. Kubrick's vision of
the molding of a Marine fails to

« capture an echo of reality. The
obligatory hard-ass sergeant dogs
the recruits into shape with the

' ritual ejaculation of Marine
threats and insults. Of course, a
platoon wouldn‘t be complete

r without a scapegoat, so in steps
Leonard. who is promptly
branded with the loving nickname
"Gomer Pyle." Progressively be-

coming moro and more demented,
Gomer provides a smooth transi-
tion into the bloodbath of Viet-
nam.

Adding a little comic relief
along the way is Private "Joker"
(Matthew Modino), Ever the so-
cial observer, "Joker” represents
the paradox or joke of the war --
the notion of killing for peace.
This statement is slapped in the
audience's face as on Joker's hel-
met where he has written "Born
to Kill." On his jacket he spons
a peace pin. In case you smacked
your head in confusion over this
odd duality. he explains his use
of symbolism later in the ﬁlm.

Attempting to comment on
the racial polarization of Ameri-
can troops. the paradox of peace
through killing, and the rampant
American barbaric tendencies,
Kubrick ends up trivializing the
issue through the use of ill-con-
ceived and offensive metaphor.
The only battle scene in the ﬁlm
revolves around a sniper attack,
which is meant to serve as ti mi-
crocosm for the entire war. The
North Vietnamese sniper plays
with the American soldiers, many
of whom fall victim due to their
warped sense of valor and honor.
To add salt to the wound. the
sniper is a woman. It is just this
kind of cheap gimmick that this
ﬁlm thrives on.

A great disappointment
from a modern master, the Viet»
nam War equipped Kubrick with
more than enough ammunition
for a scathing epic. Instead, Full
Metal Jacket is just a hollow and
trite two-hour portrayal of an
American tragedy through the
eyes of an outsider.

She Ware 3 Yellow Ribbon

by Georgia Dentel

John Ford's She Wore A
Yellow Ribbon is a paciﬁst ﬁlm
in which John Wayne plays the
part of an aging cavalry officer
intent on leaving a legacy of
peace between the whites and the
Indians. Ford and his cinema-
tographer, Winton C. Hoch,
studied Frederic Remington's
Western paintings in their
preparation for making the film.
The result is a series of remark-

able visuals which convcy the
vastness of the prairie. Ford used
this image in several of his
ﬁlms. but never better than in
She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,
where cavalry with ﬂags ﬂying,
gallup across horizons capped by
a limitless, blue sky. In addition
to Wayne, Ben Johnson, John
Agar, Harray Carey Jr., and
Joanne Dru play the major roles.

Grease: uninspired

nostalgia

by Anya Grundmann

Based on the Broadway
show premiering in 1972,
Grease, the movie, starring
Olivia Newton-John and John
Travolta, hit the screens during
the hot summer of '78. Steeped
in 1950's nostalgia, the movie
portrays an era of bobbyasoxcrs
and circle pins, pedal pushers and
leather jackets. Sandra Dee
(Newton-John) is the embodir
mom of this conﬂict; she meta»
morphoses from a bland, pretty
Aussie into a leather-clad fifties
sexpot to match cool Danny
(Travolta) and ride off to high-
school heaven in a souped-up old
Chevy.

Directed by Randal Kleiser.
the film lacks the authenticity
and vitality of its Broadway prea
decessor. Apparently, Kleiser has
no feel for the time he is repre-
ducing, which may be because he
was only two years old in 1950.
Kleiser depends on lively musical
numbers to carry the burden of
the otherwise mediocre, fiat fare.

The mum: and artful choreograr
phy are highlights, though much
of the camera play «or lack
Ihercof—- is uninspired.

Don't expect to see the ac»
tors at their best, either. "though
Travolta certainly makes a good
stab at playing gang leader Danny
Zuko, his performance doesn't
dominate as it did in Saturday
Night Fever, where his Tony
Manero had more guts. Who
knows what Newton-John's best
is. but Didi Conn, Stockard
Channing, and left Conaway
have their moments. The film is
also dotted with old fifties fa-
vorites, namely Eve Arden. Sid
Caesar, Edd Bymcs, and Frankie
Avalon, though none are given
dialogue worthy of them.

In any case, the movie
should bring back some awkward
preteen memories. Warm up
those vocal chords and dredge up
those old songs.

Broadway Danny Rose

Broadway Danny Rose is
the story of one of life's losers --
Danny Rose (Woody Allen) . a
small-time talent ageilt who rep»
resents such "winners" as a slut-
tering ventriloquist, a blind xy-
lophonist, a woman who plays
tunes on water glasses, and a
parrot that sings. His more
promising clients stay with him
until near the brink of "stardom"
and then sign on with bigger
agents.

The main story of the ﬁlm
is the relationship between Rose
and one of the more promising of
his talents, Lou Canova (Nick
Apollo Forte), an Italian singer
who basically cannot sing.
Canova is married but his true
love is Tina (Mia Farrow), the
widow of a Mafioso. The
adventures of Tina and Danny,
who at one point in the film
must bring her as his date to a
benefit at which Canova is
singing, provide some amuscv
ment. But Tina eventually pep
suadcs Canova to dump Danny
and go with a big-time agent.

performance hero unlike any of
her others. Her character. a
tough, gum»chewing, nasally-
accented, woman with louslcd,
bleached out hair, looks so
unlike her you have to look

hard to believe it's her. Besides
the interest factor though, her
playing against type doesn‘t
really do anything for the ﬁlm.
The film itself is Allen's
revival of Damon Runyon‘s
Broadway stories, such as "Little
Miss Marker" and "Guys and
Dolls." These were stories of
racketecrs and entertainers with
hearts of gold, who knew noth~
ing but the Broadway world they
lived in. With this little 85
minute film, Allen saves such
stories from modern oblivion.

The Producers

Mel Brooks' The Producers is
simply one of the best comedies
ever made. It stands as one of
Brooks' earliest and finest works,
as he attacks the Singing in the
Rain "Let's make a movie"
genre.

Gene Wilder and Zero Mostcl
star as the movie makers. But,
as two con-men who hatch a
money-making scheme to lure
investors. a successful picture is
not their goal. Their aim is to
make a movie that is guaranteed
to be a financial bomb. The two
ﬁgure that once the movie fails,
they will not have to reveal that
they kept most of the money.

Therefore, Wilder and Mostel
decide to make a movie in such
bad taste, that no movie Viewer
will watch without demanding
their money back.

Culminating with the
hilarious "Springtime for Hitler,"
a song and dance segment of
Wilder's and Mostel's movie, The
Producer: is a testament to
Brooks' ability as a ﬁlmmaker.
