Health Center
Cuts Services

by Debbie Chase

At a discussion during the Joint
Board meeting on Wednesday, Jim
Tederman, dean of student allairst
announced that Health Services
will make iour changes next iall
concerning care administration.
The Center will hire a full-time
medical secretary, allocate all
nursing services to the director of
the Health Center, discontinue giv-
mg out aver-the—counter medica-
tion except upon written or
telephone orders by the student's
local physician, and stop providing
allergy injections to students who
have not seen a local physician

The center hired a medical
secretary because at present over
half the nurse’s time is spent doing
administrative tasks. The
secretary will handle patient tral»
fic, maintain all written and come
puterized health iniormation, and
answer the telephone. with this ad-
dition to the staif, the director will
have more time to devote to nurs-
ing care and so the center will not
need another primary nurse,

The drug-administering policies
were changed due to liability risk,
By giving the drugs away. the
center becomes responsible for
suggesting that the student take
them. Ii something goes wrong. the
center could be sued, “The last
thing we want to see is the Health

Center’s disappearance from cam-
pus because oi liability charges,”
said Tederman.

students will now have to buy
drugs at the Grinnell bookstore,
where they will be sold at cost
Since the bookstore will sell the
drugs instead oi giving them away,
and since it will not advise buyers
as to which drugs to take, it cannot
be held liable, _

The Health Center changed the
allergy-injection policy so that ii a
student has complications alter
receiving an injection, he or she
will have a local physician readily
available to treat the problem.

Despite these decreases in ser
vices, student healthcare costs
will not go down. in fact they will
increase next year. The health
care cost to students as
represented in the comprehensive
ice was $56 for this academic year.
Next year it will rise to $60. Accorr
ding to Tederman. the health tee is
more oi an insurance policy than a
service charge. “We're not pleased
about this. either," he said
“Ironically, I wouldn't be surpris-
ed if this wound up costing us more
money,”

The Health Center will still ad~
minister first aid and provide crut-
ches, bandages, and other external
remedies.
