SGA Notes

Joint Board gave a maior por-
tion oi its time this week to con
sidering a letter to be sent to the
trustees reilecting student
dissatisfaction ,with the combinar
tion oi a new 3-2 iacuity schedule,
no new iacuity. and a tuition in-
crease, Professor Don Smith,
chairman oi the iaculty, spent 45
minutes answering questions
about the proposal. Protessor
Smith said that the 3-2 proposal
was very important to the morale
ot the iaculty and to recruiting new
people, while opposing suggestions
that implementation or the new
schedule be delayed. He also sug-
gested that those students in
departments hard hit by the [aculr
ty hiring ireeze consult with the
chairmen or those departments. A
suggestion that the 3-2 proposal be
implemented in some areas but not
in others was turned down by him
because, he said, it would appear
as another broken promise to the
{acuity and because it would make
it much moredilficulttodetermine
where iacutly increases were
needed. Professor Smith did not at
tempt to deny or minimize the fact
that there would be problems tor
the students. He did say, however,
that no courses required for ma-
' jors or ireshman tutorials would be
cut, and that there would be
enough slats courses tor everyone
Alter this discussion, an amend-
ment was proposed to send the lelr
ter to the president. executive vice
president, and dean oi tat-ulty as
well as to the trustees, Another
amendment included the iacuity
as well A proposal to send a
similar but more conciliatory let-
ter to the faculty was voted down
Aiter several grammatical
changes. discussion was held con-
cerning the opposition to the tuition
increase expressed in the letter
The opposition remained in alter it

mostly tor rhetorical eitect and
morale. The letter was then pass
