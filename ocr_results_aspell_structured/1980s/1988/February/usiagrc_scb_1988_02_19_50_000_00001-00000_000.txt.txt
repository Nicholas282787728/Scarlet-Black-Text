Faculty Shows
Overwhelming
Support for 3-2
Teaching Schedule

by Debbie Chase

The laculty or the college ap-
proved the proposed :72 teaching
schedule by a vote or do to 3, at a
meeting Monday aiternoon. The
program. which will take eilect
next semester, calls lor laculty
members to leach a total oi live
courses per year, with either three
in the {all and two in the spring or
vice versa, Full»time laculty
members currently teach six
courses per year.

With the addition of three new
prolessors, which the college plans
to hire {or next fall, the number of
course offerings will fall 10 per-
cent, according to Don Smith,
chairperson of the faculty. The col-
lege plans to phase in six to eight
new professors over the next few
years.

The current curriculum, which
has seen no major changes since
the core requirements were drop
ped in 1971, will most likely see a
decline in the number of section of-
ierlngs in introductorydevel
courses, according to Smith. The
number of students in the 200- and
30Mevel courses will increase, and
some courses, such as Eastern
European History, will not be oi-
feted!

Before a vote was cast at the
Monday meeting. faculty
members were given the oppor-
tunity to voice their opinion of the
new program. George Drake,

Portions ol his speech text follow.

“This is the central hypothesis ol
my presentation. The democratic
countries contributed to the suc-
cess ol Germany’s campaign to ex-
terminate the Jewish people ol
Europe by maintaining a relative
silence; by not sharing with their
own countrymen what they knew
oi the tinal solution; by not iniorni-
ing the people oi Europe, both Jew
and Gentile alike, ol the Nazi
policies; and iinaily, by remaining
relatively passive in terms oi
policy response until late in the
war. [Because or these iactorsl the
German policy was lar more suc-
cessiul than it need have been.”

Smith cited the advantage 0! imv

“There is a widespread sense
among laculty that ii we start the
program now, it will boost the
morale ol the college and the iacul-
ty. We have the will and the way to
do it." Jack Dawson commented
that phasing the program in
gradually, as some have sug»

because it would be very difficult
to anticipate Where problems
might occur. '

Others commented that im-

Wesleyan, Pomona, or Carlton?”
asked Tom Hietala. professor of
history. “It’s not our number of

time to write, think, and publish,
we will become a truly distinguish
ed college among well-reputed col-
leges. We must produce knowledge
as well as teach it."

“We think of ourselves as one of
the best institutions in the US.,”
said Peter Connolly, proiessor or
English. “We are now playing in a
better league. If we are to obtain
quality iaculty that’s in line with
the best institution in America, we
must have an adequate plan."

Despite overwhelming suppport
ior the plan. there was some dis-
sent. Ali ElSafiar, vice president of
’the Student Government Associa
tion, suggested several problems.
He said that immediate implemen-
tation of the new schedule would
cause a raise in tuition, a raise in
class size, and a decline in the

number 01 class ollerings. ElSafa
far said that he found these conse-
quences “unpalatable,” pointing
out that they would lower student
morale.

He suggested instead that the ad-
ministration phase in the program
over several years. “If we go
slower, then we can have a better
school where administration,
laculty, trustees. and students all
work together," he said,

Morris Parslnw, proiessor at
French, and John Mohan, pro»
lessor oi Russian, both opposed the
program in any term. Parslow said
that the new schedule would in

crease the cost oi education
without improving its quality. in
addition, he said, the plan would
not ben’elit'the college as a whole.
“We are creating a sell-serving
resolution,” he said. “Nothing the
trustees do or any improvement
we try will erase this"

Mohan lound [ault with the new
program because he says it laiis to
identity the real problem at Grin-
nell, which he says is the lack oi an
adequate number of secretaries
lor laculty members. He said that
the laculty does not need to spend
less time teaching, but rather less
time 'ftyping and paper~moving,"

 

the time a person arrived at the
camp until they were killed was 55

minutes" _
"...Let me briefly sketch ior you

the responses ol Britain, the
United States, and Sweden to the
events between 1941 and 1945. In all
three cases l'm going to ask three
questions: when did people know,
what was the response to that
knowledge. and what was the ac-
tual policy that was adopted by the
country and how can that policy be
explained.”

in terms of knowledge, the
British undoubtedly got informa-
tion as quickly as anybody outside
oi Germany. There was lully-
documented. published informer
tion about a campaign to kill
Poland’s Jews in June and July of
1942. So much so, the Minister of
information actually held a press
conlerence in early July to make
public this information. There is
the question, however, at even it
the information was available, was
it believable. Therefore the ques-
tion becomes, when did the people
accept that there was a
systematic campaign?"

“,..What about in the United
States? The question ol knowledge
is a bit more complicated. We were
physically more removed lrom
Europe and inlormation came in
very strange ways. The informa-
tion usually came via London and
was not as thorough as that known

Trustee Takes His Skills

Trustee Ronald Sandler. native
of West Des Moines and Grinnell
graduate, class oi ‘62, is a
distinguished-looking man with a
suit, level voice that gives the im-
pression he has weighed each word
carelully beiore speaking. All or-
thopedic surgeon in Mesa, Arizona,
he is not taken with the idea of talk»
ing about his job as a trustee.

How did he become a trustee?
“A friend of mine who was in
school when I was here was a
trustee, and he talked to me [about
becoming one]," Sandler explains
succinctly. Well. why did he want
to be a trustee? “Grinnell is like a
iamily to me. I've always been an
emotional and linancial supporter
loi the college] ..This gives me a
good opportunity to become active
ly involved.”

However, apart irom the
trustees' three meetings a year,
Sandler says, “there’s not a lot of
time that l have to devote to
trustee issues. There is literature
that comes in the mail that I can
read at home alter hours, And
that‘s about it..."
