reading two stories written by a
woman during a briet period oi

1982.

"The Winter Story” is about a

"This was too much I didn't like

“Starting from that l\Vrltingl. the
whole concepts about love and
marriage changed," Lin said,

in 1980 a new marriage law was
put into citect. "The old marriage

new law says that a divorce should
be granted. This is a big dil-
lerence ”

In 1936 [here were half a million
divorces. or about one percent ol
all marriages. according to Lin.
Although by Western standards
this is not very many. Lin pointed
out that this is a significant
number tor a country that until
recently did not consider "no

0n the other hand, marriages
seem to be on the upswing. Couples
lend to marry younger now. thanks
to the new marriage law oi 1980
that states men may marry at age
22, women at 20. The government
still advocates postponing mar»

units advise couples to wait also.

However. Lin noted. "Now with
this law, they [the couple] can
point to it so they can get married
earlier."

As a child. Michael Bell,
associate proiessor of American
Studies, Wanted to he a profes»
sional basketball player with the
Boston Celtics, until he realized he
lacked the biological prerequisite.
namely height, demanded by the
game. And so, since he liked ideas.
Bell became a proiessor. He holds
B.A. degrees in history and
philosophy and both an M.A and a
PhD. in folklore and folk life from
the University or Pennsylvania.

Bell's family includes his wite,
Karen Bell. who is working with
Grinnell College Computer Ser-
vices on a desktopspublishing
system, and their ll~yearsold son.
Joshua Said Boll, “I think we are
all in the process oi atlyusting lto
Grinnell I." ~

Beiore coming to Grinnell last
semester, Bell taught for l2 years
in the English department oi
Detroit‘s Wayne State Universny,
Bell said he came to Grtiinell tor a
change and that he was primarily
attracted by the quality oi both the
students and the faculty. Bell sees
the recently passed 372 program as
beneficial {or an academic en
vironment He believes iaculty
should be composed of scholars
who read, think. and write. rathcr
than merely lecturing the same
material tor many years.

For his doctoral thesis. Bell
wrote "The World From Brown's
Lounge- An Ethnography oi Black
Middle-class Play." He is current-
ly reworking the manuscript tor
his second book, which will come
out in a year. it is an academic
work which describes the develop-
ment at American folk studies at
the beginning of the century. and
particularly the contributions oi
William Wells Newell. whom Bell
claims .is responsible for the
growth oi the discipline.

Bell said the various disciplines
which make up the American
studies major attract students in-
terested in ideas rather than
speciiic lields; the mayor provides
them tvith the "opportunity to
work out these passions in a
thoroughly academic manner." He
added that Grinnell otters all
students the "rare opportunity to
pursue these passions."

Bell’s Iavorite hobbies are
reading. music, and movies. Bell is
surprised at Grinnell students'
lack ol interest in contemporary
cinema and the culture that it
represents. He said that there is
evidently interest in contemporary
literature and poetry because the
bookstore has a good selection in
these areas.

and his political allegiance does
not lie with Paul Simon. He is.
however, a Midwesterner,
originally trom Michigan and a
graduate oi Alma College in his

Batcman never intended to
become a protessor. and
deliberately unned the trappings
oi academia 'I swore that 1 would
never go to grad school, that I'd
never be an intellectual," he said.
Two years at “working tor
minimum wage with no health lns
surance" changed his mind. and so
Bateman attended the University
oi kentucky to study natural-
resource economics.

Alter teaching at Symonds Col-
lege in Boston. Bateman described
Grinnell as “the periectjob tor me.
i wanted to be at a Small liberal
arts college and I particularly
wanted to teach classes in
economic thought. I'm already
teaching one hcre " The relaxed.
quiet envuons ol‘ Grinnell allow
Bateman to indulge two at his
iavorite pastimes, writing and
reading poetry, the latter including
the works oi Philip Levine. Phlllp
Larkin, and Patrick Cavanaugh.
He also enjoys travel. having
visited Canada, Europe. and
Airica, where he spent a year
teaching high school in Nigeria,

The intelligence and enthusiasm
oi Grinnell students is impressive,
said Bateman. "It is a rare oppnrs
tunity. I've never taught where the
level is so consistently high. it is
dirterent, and irightening, too, I'm
likely to get pilloried ti I’m not
prepared {or class," he said.
