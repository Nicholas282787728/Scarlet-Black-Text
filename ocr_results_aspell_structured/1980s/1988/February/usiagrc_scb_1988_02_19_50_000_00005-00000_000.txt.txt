For sOme Grinnell Students,

AIDS is not a Distant Issue

by Sasha Vrlunski

As students here in the relatively
sheltered world of Grinnell, we do
not oiten hear about AIDS and
might not think about it as an issue
ailecting our daily lives. Some
Grinnell students, however, have
been involved with the AIDS issue
in very personal ways.

Steve Hingtgen, a senior, spent
the iirst semester his junior year in
the Grinnellrianondon program,
For one of his classes, Hingtgen
did a project on the socialsupport
system ior gay men who had tested
positive for the AIDS virus. In
writing his ethnography, he talked
with several men Who had the
virus and wlth one man who ac-
tually had the.disease. Hingtgen
was particularly struck with the
isolation that the men Went
through once they iound out they
had the humane-Immune Virus
(HIV) “There‘s a great deal of
isolation. Once they've tested
positive they have to decide who
they lell, with the possibility olget-
ting tired irom their jobs. They
have to change their lifestyles,"
said Hingtgen. Furthermore, those
whohave the disease and are in the
hospital are usually placed in
special wards away lrom the other
patients, , .

Despite the‘ isolation, Hingtgen
also iound that there was a great
deal oi activism in the gay com-
munity in London, Hingtgen con-
sidered the activism by those who
have tested positive tor the Virus
seems to be a great source of
therapy. Hingtgen spoke several
times with Chris Spence, a man
who is HIVrpositive, who is
establishing the first AIDS hospice
in England, called the Lighthouse
Project, Hingtgen believes that
this is an important step “If you
can provide a normal atmosphere
where people can go in and out as
they please and feel accepted, you
can add immensely to their emor
tiunal health," said Hingtgen. He
also Came in Contact with another
type oi therapy called res
evaluation co-counseling. In this
therapy. "buddying" or the pair-
ing up oi two people who have
tested positive occurs so that each
person has someone that they can

talk to and who will understand
what they're going through,

Hingtgen admitted that he
wasn't sure of how to treat so-
meone who was terminally Ill ”I
didn't know how to approach so
meone who was dying," he says,

Hingigen said that being from
the United States helped him to
gain people's trust during inter-
views. He explained that the
newspapers in London have been
particularly harsh to the homosex»
ual community. “They always
seem to link the gay community
and AIDS. It adds to the problem
because then people don't think ra-
tlonally about AIDS." stated
Hinglgen. Despite this Hingtgen
said. England on the whole is much
more open and liberal about the
issue than the United States is.
Billboards displav messages to the
public about AIDS.

Like Hingtgen, Fred Morris, a
senior, spent a semester with
Grinnellrianondon. In London. he
worked in a pub where he came to
be iriends with a gay man who was
HIVrpositlve. Christopheri a
pseudonym . did a large amount or
research and came up with many
exotic beliets and diets as a part of
healing himseli “He seemed very

_ desperate. but at the same time, he

didn't seem desperate at all." said
Morris. Christopher had bought
himseli a canal barge on which he
lived and traveled, Morris thinks
that he was in a sense isolating
himseli and lighting his own battle.

“He had hit this equilibrium and
had come to terms with what
might happen to him," said Mor-
ris.

Christopher was the that person
Morris had ever known with the
HIV virus, but Morris was not
threatened by him. “The reality or
the situation Wasn’t scary at all,"
he said. Ii Christopher didn't come
to the bar tor a iew days, Morris
added. one at his iriends irom the
bar would usually go check on him.

During her Rosentleld interns
ship. Laurie Dunivant gota chance
to see how the media is portraying
AIDS on television. Working ior

surveyed the networkrall'illate
television. Working ior Media
Watch, an agency oi Center ior
Population Options, Dunivant
surveyed the networkraﬂiliale
television stations in the ten most
AlDSaiilicted cities in the United
States, Her goal was to iind out
how those aiiiliates were presen-
ting AIDs and related iniormation
on television. Dunivant iound sure
prising dilierences between sta-
tions in varying parts at the coun-
try. According to Dunivant, net
work aiiiliates in Los Angeles are
“dealing a lot more liberally and in
my opinion, a lot more
responsibly," than many other star
tions nationwide. Some television
stations she iound to be airing very
lew publiceservice announcements
concerning AIDS and those that
were aired Dl'ten appeared late at
night and not during primetime
hours In addition to ireouency and
times oi airing. Dunivant sees a
problem with advertisements that
are melodramatic, giving people
the idea that sex equals death. Her
main concern is the amount oi igr
norance and tear that she iinds
among Americans today, She
stresses that we need to iind a
balance; we need to educate peo-
ple but not to the point that people
unnecessarily sacrilice their sex
uality out or tear. She tells a story
or meeting a man in the bar where
she used to work at night, who had
not had sex ior three years because
oi his iear oi contracting AIDS.

In addition to educating people
responsibly, Dunivant believes
that education is everyone's
responsibility. homosexual or not.
“People are leaving Ale educa-
tion up to the gay population, and
that's wrong." said Dunivant.
“People on this campus need to
take the time to educate
themselves."

media. I think that generally the
mass media is scared about AIDS.
In New Orleans the newspapers
and the three alliliates have been
very responsive, and I can't iault
them ior that. ,

We don't have any coordinated
publicschool education and none
in the parochial schools. There has
been sex education in Jeiierson
Parish [the district neighboring
New Orleans Parish]. My concern
is ior the gay young people. the
