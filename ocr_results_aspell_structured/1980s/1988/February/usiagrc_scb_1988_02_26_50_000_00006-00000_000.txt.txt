To the Editor:

Consistent with his usual ability
at intelligent commentary, Educa-
tion Secretary William Bennett. in
a speech given earlier this month
to the National Association of In»
dependent Colleges and Univer-
sities. complained that higher
education has been losing credibili-
ty because oi “curricular debase»
ment at our colleges.” Bennett
claimed that ”the serious Voices
li.e., Plato and Shakespeare] are
being drowned out by the trendy
lightweights lie, women's studies
and history-oi-minorltyerlghts
classes. etc ] in our midst 'l Bene
nett's comments are signiitcant ior
two reasons: iirst, they represent
an idiocy and inanity rarely
paralleled on this planet and see
cond, and more signiiicantly.
because of the response they drew
irom Grinnell’s own ’George
Drake.

Drake. in a brilliant response,
pointed out DO Bennett that colleges
and universitia are designed to
,serve as arenas wherea number oi

competing voices including
those Bennett would call nonsenr
sical 7 can be heard Said Drake,
“It wouldn't be a college unless we
provided an arena where nonsense
can be spoken. debated, and con
ceivably refuted.” Drake then
went on to say something even
more signiiicant: ii the college at
mosphere is right, said the presi-
dent. “students will stand up in
class and say it's nonsense."
Doubtless these words were
wasted on Bennett, who has
repeatedly shown himseli to be in-
tellectually equivalent to a slug
tremember this guy supports the
education policies oi the man who
will tell you catsup is a vegetablet.
but Drake’s comments have a
special importance for us as
students here at Grinnell. Drake's
words should remind us that we
have the responsibility to question
authority and cry tool when we see
nonsense. 1 question. however, how

oaches Reply ‘to Letter
about Athletics

To the Editor:

Writing my thoughts to the editor
oi the Scarlet and Black has not
been an intention or mine, yet re
cent attitudes- suriacing in the
community have prompted this let-
ter.

in the seven months I've been a
coach ior Grinncll College, I've
made it a point to observe reac
tions oi students and iaculty
towards athletics in general.
Coaching is my proiession. and 1
take it seriously, It’s part oi my job
to create support. in the February
19 issue oi the Scarlet and Black, a
group of laui‘ students called ior a
continued malaise toward Intern
collegiate athletics at Grinnell.
The iollowing thoughts are not
meant to be deiensive or meant to
oiiend anyone.

Gentlemen tDavid, Stephen.
Marron. and Markl. you are
seriously missing the point oi Com-
peting in intercollegiate athletics
at the Di 'sion.lll level, My main
responsib ty as a coach is to get a
group oi individuals to work
together, to think alike in such a
way that "we" have one common '

goal, something that doesn't hap-
pen oiten in liie. Basketball and
soccer just. happen to be my
medium.

we teach the game, but we teach
more than the game. By example.
we teach commitment, caring, a
concern ior each other. and a
“presence" necessary to be we
cessiul in other areas oi a human
being‘s development. I need to tell
you something, fellas. I'm oiiend»
ed by the thought that you would
think l demand (like some whistle.
blowing ioolt. Good coaches don’t
demand. they command.

i also believe that the majority oi
the Grinnell College varsity
athletes would be otiended that you
think they are treated like X5 and
Us on a chalkboard tmere rohom.
You just are oii base and need to
observe objectively ior a longer
period or time. what we're actual
ly trying to do here is create
another area oi excellence in an
environment oi excellence. You're
welcome to enjoy that success r

To the Editor:

Enough is enough! The Feb. 19
issue oi the Scarlet and Black con-
tained an editorial discounting the
role that athletics should play at
Crinnell College. David Cox,
Stephen Hardwick. Marron Stout
and Mark Swanson wrote. ”...the
athletic teams now take
themselves iar too seriously " To
this i must respond.

Diversity is a key element
characterizing the student body
here at Grinnell. Students irom
near and tar bring a variety oi in-
terests to this campus. it is my
understanding that the environ»
mentat Grinnell is one in which we
“celebrate diiierences." not dic~
tate values. The students here are
tree to grow in the endeavors that
they choose to pursue, Please con»
tinue to enjoy your interests and let
others enjoy theirs. —Jim Gilbert,

however. that the iaculty would not
come right out and state that this is
why they voted tor the 3.2 pro-
grain.

The proiessors will state that the

classes and do research. Well. now
that they have fewer classes, they
won't need the extra time for class
preparation, so it all must be going
to research, Now the question is.
will additional faculty research
really improve the college, or,
more important to the students,
will this research improve the
quality of the education received at
Grinnell‘l

First of all. the one thing that
separates Grinncll irom Pomona,
Wesleyan. or Carleton is not
research. What sets Grinnell apart
irom those supposedly “truly
distinguished colleges" is that
Grinnell is situated in the middle of
the corn capital or the world. iii
you are irom lowa, please do not
take oiiense. l happen to like Iowa.
but it is the corn Capital oi the
world and not much else.) The only
way to erase this deticiency is to
move either Grinnell to a heavily
populated area or a hell or a lot oi
people to iowa. Neither is going to
happen It seems to me that now
that the proiessors will have more
time outside oi Class to do
research, they will have to take
more sabbaticals to gather the
sources they need ior this
research. because lowa holds few
of these, i tail to see how this is
beneﬁcial to the college,

Being the daughter at a pro
iessor at another small liberal-arts
school, I am not ignorant oi the
need ior proiessors, especially the
younger ones, to produce research
ii they are going to advance their
Careers. In the academic world. a
proiasor‘s success is no longer
judged on whether or not he or she
can teach or relate to the students.
but on whether or not he or she can
produce important works tor the
academic world. i, personally. do
not believe that this Change was ior
the beneiit oi the students whom
they taught, Most oi this research
is so specific that it can only be
beneficial to students at the
graduate level. it will also increase
the options oi proiessors to go on to
other more “prestigious" colleges,

Protests
Darby
Addition

To the Editor:

i wish to protest the addition that
was recently made to Darby gym-
nasium. While I was not crazy
about Darby's architecture to
begin with, i believe the brick box
now attached to the building is
especially disiiguring , a carbun-
cle on the lace of an old friend. If it
is intended as an improvement to
computer iacilities. it is obviously
only a stopgap measure to house
those iacilities. The exterior
change looks like an incinerator.
The interior changes give new
meaning to the word "shoddy," as
in the phrase “shoddy construce
tion " Not only are there the usual,
Grinnell cinderblocks. (familiar
irom existing Darby construction.
as well as from the new science

Aesthetic misiudgment is not the
only cause ior protesting this
hideous mistake The interior
changes have also proved very
troubling to basketball players
who must now avoid construction

Once again, the Grlnnell ad
ministration has ignored all sense
oi tact in making decisions, while
this one example might seem a
small error. it isn't. It is just one
aspect oi the administration's ine
sensibility to design and good con
struction. This college doesn’l
have the slightest idea how to build
iirst-rate new buildings. What will
