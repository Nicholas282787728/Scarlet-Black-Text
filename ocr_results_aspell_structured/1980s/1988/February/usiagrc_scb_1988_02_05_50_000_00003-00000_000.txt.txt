Historian Discusses
Gay Life Today

by Bruce Emond

"The only difference between

gays and every other minority is
that we can hide.” said James
Saslow, an art historian and
authority on gay studies who was
last week's Convocation speaker.
"If you are a woman, it is obvious.
it you are black or Hispanic, it is
obvious Gay people have the
choice to deny they are members
or a minority group it they think it
is going to create problems."

Saslow began his research on
gay and lesbian studies in the early
mos, Although homosexuality.
having been removed irom the
American Psychiatric
Associallon's list oi mental
disorders, was becoming more ac-
cepted. Saslow’s proposal to locus
on gay people in the arts was met
with skepticism by his proiessor at
Columbia University “The iirst
thing he did was push his chair fur
ther away irom me, The second
was to tell me that there was not
enough literature alld resources on
the subject, which was not true."
said Saslm .

while writing his dissertation on
on the myth oi Ganymede, Saslow
uncovered what he described as a
"tremendous" amount oi mlurmar
tion on gay history and the
histories oi other minority groups.
There were the same examples oi

_ preyudice, bias, and ignorance

Even today these things keep
minorities irom speaking up,"
stated Saslow.

The traditional suppression oi
gay themes irom art can be traced

take it seriously. But why is that?
We all want the same things out oi
his a love, work, iriends, Why
aren‘t those things relevant? Who
says the culture of minorities isn’t
Worthy oi the attention of the ma-
jority’.’” ‘

According to Saslow, gays must
wrestle with a doubleredged

, sword: it they stay in the closet,

they often must deal with the emo-
tional pain or concealing their sex-
ual preierence. but it they choose
to come out. they are liable to be
accused of Haunting then
homosexuality, He says that he has
encountered the latter argument
“i've had people criticize me (or
grinding an axe, and I‘ve been told
that l'm making excessive claims
about homosexuality All I am do-
ing is citing historical facts, and all
iacts are relevant. Tlte people who
are saying that are grinding their
own axe and want gays to stay
quiet." Saslow asserted

The issue of an artist's personalir

Still a controversial one in the art
world. Some art professors.
scholars. and critics omit
reference to the sexual preierence
01 gay artists like Caravaggio and
Rosa Bonheur because they
believe it is of little relevance,
Saslow reasons that this emission
is often an indication of their own
unease with the subject. "People
who talk like that are obviously uns
comfortable with the subject." he
said "I think they often have the
iceling that they're helping the are

to mainstream society's rejection
of minority interests, believes
Saslow. “There is that famous line
that history is written by the vies
tors. and they are not interested in
assigning anything to the losers In
art history, we are getting better in
recognizing the minority, but the
tradition has been to look just at
the mainstream," he said,

Gay works are oiten excluded
from mainstream distribution
because their subject matter is
considered irrelevant and not
viable ior the majority's tastes

Girls! Polish

Mirrors!

Smile,- and Let’s Face It!

By John Durham

The time has come, girls, for a searching oi souls.
The time has come for a long, long look into that lullslength

mirror. Bul let me ﬁnish.

Last week the Sim ran a story concerning coed dislikes about

college men.

To balance things, and make everyone happy,_ we

ihave conducted our own poll this Week, to discover what it is

lthat Grinnell men dislike about Grinnell Women.

land brace vourselves.

First and ioremost, the boys
think you're sloppy. They think
your hair is unkempt and your
clothes the gee-I-nnly-gotrup-
{ive-minuzes-beture~class lo o k .
They don't like blue jeans, ba-
bushkas, or poor color schemes.
You are, in the opinion oi.
Grinnell men, 'poor conversar
You either talk
too little, or too much, about
the wrong things—old ho
iriends, for example, -

The boys also say.youlre un-
sophisticated, that you look at
lite through the eyes or a high
school freshman with his iirst
drink safely inside him, You're
too unconcerned about the mon—
ey oi the man you’re out with,
and tar too concerned about
parting with a goodnight kiss.
You are. that is. unrealistic.

And that's not all. Here are a
iew more complaints we gar—
nered irom the North campus:
Knitting in classes, or anywhere
else; too heavy makeup, clum-
sily applied; an eagerness to go
steady: artificiality; Sum-chew»
ing; the checking system where-
by men are compared among
various girls who’ve dated them.

But brace up, girls. The end
has not come. Two oi the
gentlemen interviewed had no
complaints whatsoever; ﬁnd
those who did complain, you
may rest assured, will con-
tinue to beat paths to the
doors on South campus.
