Grading the Liberal Arts at Grinnell

by Bruce Emond

The push to careerism and
businesssoriented educations in the
mid- and late 19705 relegated Grin-
nell to the position ot an educa
tional anachronism. a bastion of
the liberal arts in central Iowa. To-
day. trends have changed and
liberal arts is the ‘hot' education
ior aspiring yuppies and
stockbroker wanna-bees. Although
Grinnell offers only liberal-arts
degrees. statistics from the past
decade reveal a rise in humanities
and social-science majors, In 1976.
English majors constituted o 7 per
cent oi the graduating class. in the
class oi 1986. English majors had
increased to 11.3 percent of all ma-
jors in languages. including
Spanish. French. German. and
Russian, the number of majors
rose from 5.3 percent in the class of
1976 to 9.5 percent in the class or
1986

In the wake oi larger colleges
and universities that are reverting
to core curricula and distribution
requirements. curricular changes
at Grinnell seem likely. especially
since some students have managed
to use the open curriculum to {it
their own definition o[ a liberal-
arts education.
A 19133 report by the curriculum
coordinator Morris Parslow show~
ed that some students in the class
oi 1983 had manipulated the open-
curriculum system to avoid taking
classes in some departments and
divisons. The Parslow report
revealed that 22.7 percent of the
graduating class took no
mathematics (excluding computer
courses and statistics); 22.2 per-
cent took no laboratory science
and 5.9 percent took no natural
science oi any kind; 16.6 percent
took no his ry. humanities, or
American- ’ Iization courses. and
28.5 percent took no history
courses whatsoever: 13.3 percent
took no ioreign language course.
20.6 percent did not achieve two-
semester proficiency. and 32.3 per-
cent did not *achieve three~
semester proilciency in a ioreign
language; as percent took no
literature course oi any kind; and
2.3 percent took no social science.
with 45 percent not taking a two
semester sequence in social
science.

Faculty

Professor of Classics Gerald
Lalonde has been one of the most
vocilerous proponents oi a core
curriculum among the Grillnell
faculty. “Grinnell has a fine
liberalrarts curriculum and it pro
fesses the ideal that all students be
educated in all the departments, it
does a iairly good job in advising
that students take courses in the
humanities. socml studies. and
science, but in not requiring it the
school is deficient." says Lalollde.
"Maybe just live percent oi
students abuse the ripen cure
riculum, but if the school has a
philosophy of making sure
everyone gets a liberal ts educa-
tion then it should be w' ing to put
it on the line." Lalonde thinks
many students avoid those courses
which they perceive as particular-
ly tough. ”There is not a problem
with the social sciences or fine arts
but there is in languages and those
disciplines which are vigorous and

necessarily sequential." he says.
Like Walker. lalonde believes a
common course fosters an intellec-
tual and academic bond between
students, “Taking a common
course produces an esprit among
students. I remember when
Humanities 101 and 102 were re-
quired and students were reading
the ”Iliad" at the same time. The
exchange oi ideas was very in-
teresting."

Lalonde does concede
that Grinnell still otters a sound
liberalrarts education, and he
credits the student population with
ensuring the continuation of the
school's academic wealth. “I found
it remarkable. the readiness of my
students to sign up for languages.
We're being more selective and
there is a larger application pool.

- There are more students who don't

care ii a course is required or not,
it is not important to a quality slur
dent."

Assistant proiessor oi history
Tom Hietala defines the goal of a
widcranging program oi study as
being to "familiarize the student
with the various ways oi
understanding and interpreting
both the natural world and the
world oi social. economic.
political. and cultural relations.
Liberal-arts instruction that in-
cludes history. tor example. should
teach students not only to read the
text of a document. but also to read
between the lines oi the document
and, even more signiiicantly, to
read the document for what it does
not say as well as tor what it does
say " Hietala believes that “that
ability, oi course. is indispensable
to good Citizenship and profes-
sionalism. in the best sense of that
loosely detined term. All academic
disciplines have useiul methods
and insights ior perceiving and
understanding the world around
us, and a student misses a crucial
opportunity it he or she rejects a
wide area of academic disciplines
in order to follow narrow careerist
goals."

Hietala says the issue oi re
quirements tor a liberal-arts
degree “is an extremely diiiicult
and divisive one. We might achieve
a consensus on the argument that
all students should study a loreign
language. study mathematics, or
Study religion. but that has to be
balanced against a view that
students usually learn more in
courses that they select than in
courses that they feel are foisted
upon them," Hietala says that one
or the major problems is choosing
what courses constitute a true
liberalvdrts education. "One of the
problems liberal-arts Iacultles
lace, even on a departmental level.
is what makes up the core at an iii-
dividudl discipline." says Hietala
”Do we study English history or
Japanese historyi Should a stu~
dent be aware of the new tcmlnlsl
scholarship to be \vellreducatcd'.’ is
computer literacy essential to the
undergraduatci Diricrcnt students
and different [acuity will answer
these questions in diiicreiit ways.
But even it the questions cannot be
answered, it is important that they
be debated. That spirit of debate
and inquiry i at the heart oi the
liberal arts. concludes Hietala.

Protcssor o1 anthropology
Ronald Kurt'l. feels that Grinnell is
a tine example oi a liberal-arts
school. “Personally I think we do a
line job here. We have a strong em-
phasis on all segments or a liberalr
arts education We have not given
in to Careerlsm, but We have taken
iioie that liberal-arts graduates
must be prepared to sell
themselves in the real world,"
Kurtz is opposed to a core cur-
rlcillum because he sees it as an
outdated and prejudiced educa-
tional system. "The traditional
core curriculum was developed
when we were an imperial culture
out to dominate the World. It was
appropriate tor a culture that
focused on theI Western tradition
and just wanted to pass that on,"
states Kurtz. "Then we could idenr
llfy” a core. But that culture was
ethni’rcentrlc. malerdominaled.
and prejudiced against other
ethnic groups. Such a core is no
longer adequate to a modern
world." Paraphrasing the an-
thropologist Eric Woli, Kurtz says,
"We have to study humanity [as a]
whole. and that includes all of us.
Central to that study is to unders-
Lind our relationship to other
cultures and traditions. There is no
model core." Kurtz states that
schools should not be concerned
with claiming the specitic content
of a student's education but instead
how the student approaches his or
her education.

Students

Student opinions on Grinnell's
value as a liberalarts school are
as diverse as those among the
iaculty Sophomore Bill Lohaus, a
pnliticalscience/German major.
says the diliiculty oi getting a dou-
ble major proves the college's
commitment to ensuring students
get a good liberal-arts education.

--crlnnell is very good at making,

sure students stay liberal The bot-
tom lino with double majors is that
|f you are going to sacriiicc the
detinition oi a broad liberalrarts
education, it you are just going to
end up taking courses in your two
majors, then they won‘t approve it,
it is hard to get a double mgm‘."
says Lohaus Lohaus would favor
somc distribution requirements
"It is possible to graduate trom
here just taking courses in music

and chemistry 1think it would bca '

good idea for the college to say that
you hu\u to take two courses in
each division That's why pass/tail
is here.- so you can take courscs
you're unsure 0!.” says Loliaus,
Lohaus
getting is not necessarily prepara-
tion ior one career but u

erts, "I think what I'm ‘ '

die on many areas. In my classes
I'm forced to argue and defend
positions and you learn to think on
your teet. 1 get this in my social-
science courses. especially. I can
see myself going into law, politics.
or. the diplomatic corps. Going
here has prepared me ior those
careers,"

Junior Todd Francis came to
Grinnell Irom his hometown of Line
coin, Nebraska, intent on majoring
in physics, He later switched to
biology and he believes that at a
larger college or university this op-
tion would not have been available.
"If I had gone to a school where I
had to specialize,’l probably would
have stuck with physms," says
Francis. “At a liberal-arts school
there is more flexibility, you get to
take more courses and you defer
being specialized." Francis has
taken a wide range of courses in
math, science. English.
humanities. the line arts. and

-.’;

languages. He has taken two difr
ierent languages, Spanish and
Polish. and believes they will stand
him in good stead tor the tuture. “I
think that one of the advantages oi
the liberal~arts education is that
you get a chance to take so many
different courses. With Spanish
and Polish 1 can go a lot oi places
overseas. rm not just concen-
trated on biology." Francis is us
ing his Spanish background during
a semester in Costa Rica, Francis
says his adviser was particularly
helpful in encouraging him to take
a broad range oi courses. “There
was one semester where l was go
ing to take another bio course and
he said. ‘Why don't you take a
religion course instead?‘ So I did,”
recollects Francis. Francis is up
posed to a core curriculum. ‘You'd
get blowort classes to satisiy the
requirements. To me liberal arts
means freedom rather than
restriction, and forced liberal arts
seems a contradiction. especially
at Grinnell.”

A liberal-arts education often
allows students finally to discover
the disciplines they enjoy and to
eliminate others. Junior Barbara
Brown. a classics major, came to
Grinnell irom Leesburg. Virginia,
expecting to major in either math
or physics. “1 saw my own limita-
tions and chose another area to
study in. l obviously didn't choose
classms to prepare for a specific
career because it is probably the
most practically useless major
