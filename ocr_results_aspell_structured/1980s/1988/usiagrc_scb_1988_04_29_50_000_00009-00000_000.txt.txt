Scarlet and Black

On the Schneid

by Eric D, Schneider

This is the weekend we have all
been waiting ior. the weekend oi
our beer and tranquility. The buzz-
words ior the Relays/Peace Day
weekend should he “Buds, not
bombs.” On Friday. the seeds of
drunken chaos will be cultivated
for world peace on Saturday. While
on Friday everyone will he work
ing to create a beer utopia. on
Saturday everyone will be striving
ior peace and Utopia. Each
speaker and every workshop will
instruct their enthused listeners to
work in every little way possible to
start making this world a better
place ior you and me. Many oi the
speeches will locus on interna
tional relations and on nonrviolent
methods of change, and very little
attention will be devoted to sports
issues. Yet, the first steps towards
peace will not be the elimination oi
all nuclear weapons. but the
elimination of all sports from
society

After losing its iirst seven con-
ierence games. the soitball team
completed is season on Saturday
by splitting a doubleheader with ll-
linois College. The win marked the
team’s first conference win in
three years.

Despite the final score of 34. the
first game of the doubleheader was
competitive. The Lady Pioneers
gave up [our runs in the top oi the
second inning. but tied the score by
the bottom of the fifth. However,
the team allowed the Lady Blues to
score four more runs in the next
two innings.

Half of the runs in the first game
were unearned. a problem that has
plagued Grinnell all season. Mary
Allenburg's pitching allowed only
iive hits. but five errors con-
tributed to the eight runs. Grinnell.
on the other hand, pounded eight
hits. but could only manage to send
iour runners across the plate.

The second game was complete
ly different from the first. Allen-
burg pitched a threehitter. and the
Lady Pioneers had no trouble scor~
ing runs. In all but two of the inn
ings. Grinnell scored, The one ll-
linois run was unearned and Scored
in the seventh. long alter the
game's outcome had been decided.

Because Tuesday‘s
doubldieader was rained out and
not rescheduled. the season ended
on an up note. Last season, the
team dropped trom conference
play. and the year bciore. it lost
every game. Because oi the disapr
pointments of previous years.

season. the team was competitive.
and with no seniors to be replaced,
the Lady Pioneer players expect to
make a run at the Midwest Cons
ierence crown next year.

Pitcher Mary Allenburg explain-
ed. “We improved a lot over the
season. We weren't blown away by
any team.” She cited one of the
greatest problems as errors, but
with some more improvement the
team has “a chance to Win a lot
more ball games next year,"

Coach Jim Gilbert agreed.
“They're not satisfied [with just
this season]. It’s a gradual pro-
cess. More importantly. it's a
reﬂection of things to come.”
Gilbert credited all at his players’
contributions. He was especially
impressed with his freshman
players — Allenburg, Judy Thorn.
Erin Davison, and Melissa Hayes
— claiming they were “vital to the
program." At third, Neva Specht.
Gilbert claimed. was “defensively,
the thread that held the inﬁeld
together.“ He was also en-
uiusiastic about the improvement
of outfielders Jennifer Robinson
and Karen Glennemeier as well as
the play of veterans Ginny Frazer.
Pam Frese. and Diana Lewis,

“We're losing no players. and
the prospects oi bringing in more
talented Studentrathletes are
good," said Gilbert. Allenburg also
looks forward to next season. With
some additional players. she
stated. “We could get so much
more out of next season."
