Stuhr-Rommereim named
new choral director

by Susan Roth

"The music department seems
to be improving steadily," says
John Stuhr-Rommereirn. Grin-
nell College‘s new choral director
(replacing the retiring director,
James Fudge). Stuhr-Rom-
mereim, a former D. MA candi-
date and assistant conductor from
the University of Kansas. hopes
to continue and build upon the
department's past successes.

One of the principal changes
in the choral program will be to
increase the size of the Grinnell
Singers from 24 to 35, shifting
its performance emphasis to
works for larger groups. Also, in
order to increase the College
Chorus’ ranks and improve com-
munication and support between
the two groups, members of the
Singers are now required to also
sing in the College Chorus. In
the future, Stulir-Rommereim
also hopes to create a smaller
madrigal group to fill in the void
left by increasing the size of the
Singers and possibly a separate
women's chorus to accommodate
the large number of women audir
tioning for the choral groups.
One of the more immediate
innovations in the choral pro
gram. based on Stuhr-Rom-
mercim's interest and past stud-
ies, will be the performance of
traditional Russian choral music
in this year‘s concert.

Stuhr»Rommereim, a graduate
of St. Olaf College (Minnesota),
toured with the renowned St.
Olaf Choir for three years while
an undergraduate. in addition to

studying theory and composition.
He received his MA in Com-
position from the San Francisco
Conservatory of Music and, after
his wife got ajob at the
library of the University of
Kansas, entered the Doctor of
Music program at the University
of Kansas, The program's course
of study included acting as an as-
sistant conductor for two of the
university‘s choirs. According to
Stuhr-Rommereim, the conduct—
ing opportunity, "was a really
great experience It was just
what I needed to do." In addition
StuhrrRommereim was active in
organizing a Baroque orchestra
wnh several other faculty mem-
bers at Kansas.
Stuhr»Rommercim, who had
already been accepted to study
conducting under Helmut killing
of the Organ Bach Festival in
Stutgizart, West Germany, acr
cepted the position at Grinnell on
the basis of the school‘s reputa-
tion and financial health, as well
as the number of interested music
students in a non-conservatory
setting. Concerning the town of
Grinnell itself, he says "The
people around here are really an
attractive part of the town", even
though in Lawrence, Kan.. cen~
tered around the University,
"There‘s a lot more arts going on
and so we'll miss it."

Good Morning
Vietnam

"Good Morning Vietnam"
stands as the most impressive
work in the film careers of Robin
Williams and director Barry
Levinson ("Diner“, "Tin Men").
Williams stars as Adrian
Cronaucr, an American DJ. sent
to Vietnam to entertain the
troops via armed forces radio.
Cronauer immediately falls in
love, and into bad favor with his
commanding officers. The plot
moves at a brisk pace, but the
true high points of the film are
the fast-paced comic monologues
delivered by Williams while on
the airl

In "Good Morning Vietnam,"
Williams ad-libs over 20 minutes
of film time, thus recreating the
essence ofhis infamous antics as
seen on the set of "Mork and
Mindy. Director Barry Levinson
gives us an outstanding support-
ing cast, similar in style to those
in his previous successes "Diner"
and "Tin Men". Levinson‘s love
is the art of conversation, and
nobody behind the camera today
captures it in a more sensitive or
entertaining light. "Good Morn-
ing Vietnam” is pure entertainr
merit from one of
Hollywood's most gifted direcr

Adam's Fi’ib sheds
light on sexism

by Brian Strause

A film twenty years before' its
time, Adams Rib is revolution-
ary in that it vividly paints a
picture of the hypocritical
unwritten laws concerning do»
mestie violence. Audiences in
1939 certainly would not have
been ready for such controversy
on the big screen were it not pre-
sented in the optimum medium»-
comedy.

Hilarious throughout, Adam's
Rib makes its statement clearly
by presenting the absurdity of the
prevailing male dominated ethos
through a court case fought on
opposite sides by the husband-
wife team of Adam (Spencer
Tracy) and Amanda Bonner
(Katharine Hepburn). The case
revolves around a woman (Judy
Holiday) who shoots her husband
while he is cheating on her.
Amanda emotionally pleads her
case on the grounds that a man
who shoots his wife for the same
reasons would be historically let

off. In short, the law must look
at men and women in the same
light and shed itself of its SCX'
ism. Amanda’s husband Adam is
the public prosecutor and is as»
signed to prosecute Amanda's
client for attempted murderl

This courtroom battle is con»
ducive to the screwball comedy, a
genre formed and dominated by
Tracy and Hepburn. Much of the
humor is rooted in phallo-centric
allusions, a common comic for-
mula, but nonetheless is excep-
tionally relevant in "Adam's
Rib."

Katharine Hepburn portrays a
SLrong willed woman with dig-
nity and unprecedented style. In
one of her greatest roles Hepburn
rises from the ashes of Holly-
wood's degrading feminine
stereotypes and creates a character

with depth and soul. Hepburn
illuminates with life. Let her
shine on you,
