Netters: wax on, wax off

by George Mclimscy

Last week, on the ﬂoor of the
PEC, the Pioneer Women's Vol-
leyball team fell in straight
games to a powerful Simpson
squad. The match was relocated
from Darby Gymnasium when
the mats which are used to pro-
tect the floor during various non-
sporting events were rolled up.
Unfortunately, a good portion of
the ﬂoor’s ﬁnish rolled off with
the mats. This ridiculous inci-
dent, which could have been pre-
vented with some extra care,
failed to dampen tlte spirits of the
team and did not adversely affect
the attendance at the game. The
crowd was boisterous, and the
women, though overmatched,
played extremely well.

Grinnell showed signs of
first»game-jitters as Simpson
steam-rolled behind some power-
ful hitting to take the ﬁrst game
by a score of 153. At this point
the bystanders became nervous,
but the effort given in the second
game had them believing again.
Having fallen behind 9-1, the
Pioneers rallied behind the serve
of freshman Julie Kaster to nar-
row the gap to 9—7. During this
stretch, some hustle in the back
row, some digging for seemingly
lost balls, and some precision
setting enabled Melissa Fitz-
patrick and Joanne Sackelt to
record some awesome kills. Unr
fortunately, Grinnell could not
maintain this momentum and
lost the game 1547. In the final
game, the visitors again dis
played a fierce hitting attack
winning IS»2.

Last weekend the women
travelled to Dordt College for the
Dordt Invitational. Falling to
St. Mary's of Omaha, North-
western College, and Wayne
State, they were unable to chalk
any up in the win column,
Nevertheless, as coach Shiela
Cain noted, "It was a really good
experience. We played a lot of
people, and played well. Plus,
we learned a lot."

 

Grinnell will take their expe
rience onto the ﬂoor of the PEC
on September 15 at 7:00 when
they host Wartburg. "The play-
ers are psychtxl up for this one,"
Cain says, "We'll be ready to
go," As they continue to im-
prove, this Pioneer Volleyball
team should become more and
more formidable.

Women drop
two close
games

by Matt O’Heam

The women's soccer team
played a tough schedule this
weekend, playing games on both
Friday and Saturday. On Friday,
the team faced University of
Wisconsin's Steven's Point. The
Pioneers kept it close, losing a
well-played game by a score of 2-
l. Grinnell's single goal came
on a corner kick by Icnnifer
Hooper. On Saturday, the team
faced a fomidable opponent in
Tarkio of division two.
Problems developed early as
centerrhaliback Hooper was forced
out of the game with a sprained
ankle. The final score was 270.
Hooper is recovering quickly and
may even see action this
weekend. Coach Esklldsen
praised the squad. "The group
showed a lot of character," she
said. Freshman goalkeeper Asha
Morgan echoed the coach's words:
"We showed a lot of persistence
and hard work."

Eskildscn indicated that the
team has several strong points
including considerable depth at
the midfield positions. This
weekend the team goes on the
road for games against St.
Norbcn's and Lawrence.

Grinnell held their opponents in

Assessing the weekend's out-
come, coach Pﬁtsch noted, "Both
those teams were pretty tough

by so many injuries, well, I feel
both happy and lucky that we
managed to get by. We scored
when we had the opportunity, and
we hung tough when we had to

The Pioneers are trying to

Minnesota. Grinnell will play

and Augsburg in Minneapolis
Sunday. Pfitsch feels that
Carleton, which ﬁnished in the
middle of the Minnesota Athletic
Conference in ’87 with a 575
record (neck and neck with
Gustavus Adolphus), will provide
a good test for his ballclub,
especially since it's away. Let's
hope we're all healed by then.
It's gonna be a hell of a year,
