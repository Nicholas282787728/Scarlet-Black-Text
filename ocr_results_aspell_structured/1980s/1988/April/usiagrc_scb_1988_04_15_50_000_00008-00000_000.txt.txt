by Vincent Prosser
Through April 27, the Print and
Drawing Study Room and the Burl-
ing Gallery are lmturing an ex-
hibit of work by faculty members
Richard Cervene, Karin Connelly,
Robert McKihbin, and Merle
zirkie. Sculpture by Louis zirkie,
professor oi art at Grinnell tor
many years until his death in was.
is also included in the exhibition.

The artists' interests span wide-
ly dirterent methods and styles,
from Merle Zirkle's almost post-
modernist jewelry to Karin Con-
nelly's “women’s art" to Robert
McKibbin’S realistically portrayed
landscapes to Richard Cervene's
abstractions t0 the Zirkles' moder»
nist works.

All the works display the careiul
skill and technique that we would
expect from the Grinnell faculty,
Cervene's abstract paintings have
a sort of delicate, decorative preta
tiness and sureness of composition.
All of Merle Zirkle‘s works are in-
teresting, especially her jewelry,
which is the very image of fun.
Because of the kinds of chains used
for her necklaces, I don’t know how
gracefully or comrortably they
would hang. but the pendants are
fascinating. with their im-
aginative, interlocking parts.

Due to their size and impact,
McKibbin’s pastels are oi special

interest. Even a single work of his

available in the Burling Gallery,
because his works need to be view-
ed from about 10 teet away. Up
close, his generalized forms
sometimes tall apart — one can’t
tell what they depict. But lrom a
certain distance the pictures
achieve unity and can be amazing.
ly convincing. It's not a flaw that
their viewing requires a certain
distance. As they say, the cruder a
mosaic, the better its effect when
viewed from far off.

McKibbin constantly strives to
examine his environment. Despite
the fact that these works were all
created over a relatively short
period or time, they reﬂect many
different moods, from the very
unfinishedrlnoking “Grinnell
Backyards and Alley (Dusk), IA”
to the “Hedged Lane, Longwood
Gardens, PA," in which the
forceful strokes and colors resem-
ble Stis commercial-art technique.

“Storm, Grinnell, IA" does not
appeal to me personally due to is
exaggerated coloration of the sky,
but it reminds me of some of those
early landscapes done by Turner
for his patron Lord Egremont at
Petworth House. I say this because
of the dramatic, simplified color

and style, and because of the con-
trast qt .§,ky,,ahd. ,darlt earth
(although this was done on‘orange
paper, while Turner lavored blue
or hiuegrey).

No works that are wonderful
both up close and from a distance
are “High Desert (Dusk). NV" and
“Storm Over Urbana.” The pastels
are smoothly applied and have rich
smoothness, while the small
details stand out quite clearly.
McKibbin’s outstanding technique
creates two pictures that are
carefully finished but not over»
worked.

“Brigintine Beach, NJ" is pro-
bably the best of McKibbin’s works
here presented. It is not so good up
close, but is outstanding irom a
distance, Color, composition,
mood, and atmosphere are all very
satisfying to the viewer, You can
almost smell the salt air and feel
the spray. or the works on exhibit,
I think this one most reveals the in-
fluence of Sargent, an artist
McKibbin admires.

While the exhibit has great
variety, the number of works
presented by the small number of
artists allows the viewer to get a
sense of Where each artist's in-
terests really lie. It's all very
pleasing,
