Proposed Student Initiatives

Divestment

The divestment resolution pass-
ed by the board oi trustees in May.
tees, states that Grinnell College
“shall not invest in companies
which are providing strategic or
technological support ior the im-
plementation oi apartheid by the
Republic oi South Airica " Under
this policy, divestment has been
limited to corporations which have
assets in South Airica, This limited
deiinition oi divestment has enr
couraged corporations to sell their
assets while retaining economic
ties to South Airica through
“shell" corporations. These shell
corporations. through the use oi
trusts and iranchises. continue to
provide strategic and
technological support tor the aparr
theid policies oi the Republic oi
South Airica.

As students oi Grinnell College,
we support a consistent divestment
policy, one which demands eiiee
tive action against both shell core
porations and corporations which
continue to hold assets in South
Airica

the Sullivan Principles as a litmus

2. when a shell corporation has
been iormed. goods and services
continue to reach South Africa
through franchise rights and licen-
sing and distribution agreements.
Since these shell corporations are
officially based in South Africa,
corporations are able to complete
sales which were previously
restricted under the limted United
States sanctions.

3, The entire government oi South
Africa is inherently involved in the
maintenance oi apartheid. Sales to
the public sector in any iorm iall
under the definition of "strategic
or technological support " Support
ior the apartheid regime has tradi-
tionally been defined as the provir
sion oi goods or services to the
police, military, or other apartheid
enforcing agenCies However,
ascertaining information regar»
ding the distribution oi goods and
services is impossible due to the
current press bans. The traditional
deiinition is no longer a workable
one. Furthermore, South African
law, speciiically the Price Control
Act, “empowers the government to
prohibit any person or company
irom reiusing to sell its products to
any customer in South Airica. in
cluding the police and military"
(Investor Responsibility Rescarch
Center, Inc , 1984)

Sales in the private sector also
lend support to apartheid. Divestr
ment is aimed at lowering the
value of the rand and weakening
the South Airican economy ll
divestment is to be made effective.
maintaining a distinction between
the private sector and the public
sector is impossible.

We. the students of Grinnell Col-
lege, insist on the implementation
oi a divestment policy which:

1 renounces the Sullivan Prin-
ciples as a means to eiiective
change and mandates divestment
regardless oi a company’s rating
as a Sullivan signatory:

2, mandates divestment irom
shell corporations on the grounds
that are merely sham
disinvestmcnts,

3. expands the deiinition oi
"strategic and technological sup
port” include all economic ties to
South Airica.

ARH Renovation

We, the students oi Grinnell Cole
lege. demand that the present
plans tor the renovation oi Alumni
Recitation Hall be reconsidered
and modiiied in view oi the
violence they do to certain
elements oi the building's original
design

As students oi Grinnell College.
we are surrounded by the
casualties oi poorly executed
building renovations. One need on-
ly walk through Carnegie or one oi
the collegerowned houses to see
how a renovation motivated by
calls ior space, eiiiciency, and
resiliency can ignore iundamental
aesthetic concerns and a building's
heritage. Further, as students
eating, living, and studying in
campus buildings, it is evident that
our existences are proioundly ai-
iected by these buildings

Thus. we iind it necessary to obr
iect to some elements oi the plann-
ed renovation ofAlumni Recitation
Hall and its auditorium as violar
tions oi the architectural integrity
oi the building and as being con
trary to student interests ARH has
served many generations oi Grin-
nell students as the main
classroom building, the meeting
place oi student government. and
an important venue ior student
iilms and theater. A building is
always more than a product oi
bricks and mortar, square iootage,
and audio-visual capabilities. in
ARH one must iactor in the tread-
worn stairwells, the “real”
blackboards, the mosaic tile iloors,
the glorious bathrooms, the
auditorium, and the ghosts oi Grinr
nellians past, ARH auditorium is
an inviolable element of the
building as a whole and as such
cannot be destroyed , we cannot
someday recover that which is lost
to today's callous exigencyi

We as concerned students would
preier to see a restoration or ARH
auditorium iaithiul to its original
design rather than the proposed
radical gutting and restructuring,
As students and iuture alumni we
have a vested interest in preserv-
ing this landmark in sensitive
iashion. Grinnell has been slowly
losing or deiacing its historic
buildings since the '605 e to lose
Alumni Recitation Hall is to lose its
heart

Minimum Wage

The minimum wage was $3 35 in
wit; the minimum wage remained
$3.35 from 1981 to 1987 Without
positive action by the federal
government, 198% will soon be adds
ed to the list. While the minimum
wage has not been increased to ac-
count ior inilation, congressional
salaries and Social Security reci~
pients' benefits have increased.
Americans who Work for minimum
wage have received no such help.
As it stand now. minimumwage
workers iall well below the poverty
level.

The present bill before Congress

s to gradually raise the

mum wage to $5.05 Over a
period oi years. This measure is
necessary to. at the very least,
keep the minimum wage's value
from falling still further The in'
ierests who are opposed to ANY
minimum wage know the public
would never stand ior repeal oi the
minimum wage, instead they are
sitting back and letting inﬂation do
the job ior them.

The opposition to the raise is be
ing led by the same groups that ops
posed the establishment oi the
Zsrcent minimum wage in 1938 and
opposed all subsequent increases.
The Chamber oi Commerce‘s up
position, allegedly based on iears
oi resulting unemployment and in'
flation, is almost word [or word the
same argument they used in 1938
against even the Establishment oi
the minimum wage.

Most blue-collar workers are
receiving signiiicantly more than
the minimum wage already, so the
raise will not aiiect the majority or
workers. in many cases, people
now choose to accept weliare
rather than work at the low
minimum wage. so they will be
eligible ior Medicaid. Certainly,
paying people ior not producing
anything, the unintentional result
oi the current wage. is inﬂate
tionary.

The bigrbusiness lobby and the
Reagan administration raise the
specter oi unemployment ensuing
were the increase to become law.
There are exemptions ior the
special cases oi very small
businesses that might be hurt.
Massive unemployment existed
before there was a minimum
wage. Even ii the increase does
lead to the elimination DI some
jobs, the question should be, Are
those jobs worth preserving? li
those jobs don't even allow the
worker to get above the poverty
line, what use are those jobs? is
our goal to have people working at
any price or to have working peor
pie living at a decent level?

For these reasons, we, the
students of Grinnell College, feel
an increase in the minimum wage
is long overdue. We are not misled

by the crocodile tears shed by the
Chamber oi Commerce, We urge
Iowa's representatives in Congress
to stand behind such an increase,
and the Reagan Administration to
reconsider its opposition to the in
crease

College Mascot

An athletic mascot is intended to
embody the spirit oi the institution
which it represents. The Grinnell
Collegc mascot. THE PIONEERS.
was originally intended to repre-
sent the positive leading role which
this college took in athletics (Le
Grinnell held the iirst inter-
collegiate iootbrill game west oi
the Mississippii The school was
also a ”pioneer' in that it was the
iirst college west oi the Mississippi
to have a black graduate and to
enroll a woman.

However. the word pioneer has two
distinct denotations: it it reiers to
an individual or entity who is the
iirst to accomplish a signiiicant
something. and 2t it has also come
to signiiy those individuals who
“conquered” the North American
continent and the spirit with which
they undertook their exploits

No matter what the initial, reason
ior using TliE FIONEERS as
Grinnell's mascnt. the two meanr
ings are inseparable At an instllu~
tion which takes such pride in ItS
historical involvement in the
westward expansion oi the United
states (remember ”Go West
Young Man“"}. we cannot ignore
the negative side oi the concept oi
a pioneer, When we at CrinncL
honor one type oi pioneer as a
mascot. we necessarily associate
ourselves with tho other

We must recognize the iacl that
despite the herolike qualities we
have patriotically bestowed upon
the pioneers oi our country, they
and the institutions that supported
them irequently committed acts oi
ethnocide and genocide upon the
original inhabitants oi the Colitis
nent, acts which we now condemn
Our ethnocentric image oi
pioneers ignores these atrocities.

We, the students oi Grinnell Col-
lege, believe that we can iind a
more appropriate mascot in the
spirit oi the Grinnell tradition oi a
liberal education. we believe that
Grinnell should not support such
an ethnocentric image. We ask
that the trustees and the ad-
ministration take action to change
the Grinnell mascot in order to bet-
ter represent the values oi the in»
dividuals associated with this Cole
lege
