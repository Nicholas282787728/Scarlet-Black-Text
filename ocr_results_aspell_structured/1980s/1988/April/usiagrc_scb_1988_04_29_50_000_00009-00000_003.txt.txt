Big Brother to Attend Grinnell

 

'Hawn Announces

Computerized Directories

by Bob Woodward

Dale Hawn, Director of the
College Physical Plant, today
announced plans {or the college
to add new, computerized loca—
tor boards patterned after sim-
iiar devices on the syndicated
television program “Star Trek:

; Tire Next Generation." The and

nonneement was made in the (lee
teriorating halls or ARI-l to a
crowd of hostile students. The
sleek new system will replace
the gray monolitlrs recently in-
stalled around campus. “The
old ones are outmoded," i-iuwn
declarerlr “For Grinnell to stay
near the top, it must have 24th-
century technology.”

SGA Vice—president Ali EISai»
for commented, “What we have
here is a case of the ndininistra»
tion making a decision without
consulting the students This is
nothing new, so what’s the up-
roar about? l‘m used to it by
now. So should you be,”

The new devices will he in—
stalled during the summer in
lime for studeilt staff to be
trained on their use prior to New
Student Days. Staff members
will ireip to orient the incom»
ing freshmen and later, return»
iug students. Because the sys-
tem is so unbelievably easy to
use, few problems are expected

Hawn expects the system to
cost. about..$62 trillion. “It
may sound. expensive,“ he re
marked, “but we will be the.
only school with such a huge,
interactive systcm. You know,
24th-century technology doesn‘t
come cheap. Other schools of
our caliber will really envy us!"
he added with evirlent relish.

Like the models on the TV
show, the Grinnell systerrr can
be lraud- or voice- activated des
pending on which appears more
impressive to prospectives. The
screens remain dark until acti-
vaterl. Once activated, a map or
the college campus appears on
the display. With some prompt
ing, the system will then tell you
how to get to your next destiiia~
tion. Hawn feels this will help
reduce the number or pcopic
wandering about campus with
absolutely no clue as to whcrc
they are, currently one at this
school‘s biggest problems.

But the big drawing card oi
the new system is its ability to
track students. Students who
can never ﬁnd the. person they‘re

 

This $60,000 directory will soon be replaced by a
technologically superior college locator boar-do

looking for now will be able
to activate one of tilt- locator
units. All students will be issued
special insignia that emit the
student's individual radio code
The computer will trace the stu—
dent through the code of the ins
signia.

Hawn explains, “Say, you
want to know where icir Peirce
is, You can go to a unit, and say,
’Siiow me the location of ictr
Peirce.’ And the computer will
then trace Jeﬂ"s special radio
code and tell you, ’Jeﬂ' Peirce is
at Quad,m iiawn frowned attire
crowd’s growing murmur of ap—
prehension. “Of course, not all
answers will be that obvious,"
he added weakly.

The radio insignia will be is
sued to students free at charge,
but they will be expected to
wear them at all times. A siz-
able portion or the $62 trillion

budget went into the design oi
the insignia, as the administrac
tiou wanted to make sure they
found a shape students would
like. They settled on a red bar
with mating slugs. ”We thought
the students would appreciate
the furriiliarity," the director CX'
plaiiled. “They must like the
logo. They talk about it often
enough."

Student response to the new
system was uueilthusinstic. The
presentation almost turncti ugly
when one student asked if Grins
nell students would protest wears
irrg the insignia. He argued

Logo Change

by Carl nernstein

Earlier this week, Grinnell
College president George Drake
announced the implementation
or a new ncw logo. “The old
new logo was very nice but it
was a tad expensive. and we
feel that it did not accurately
represent Grinnell. it Grinnell
is to rise even higher on U.S
News and World Report’s top»
it) list, then we nrust promote
an even more positive image of
ourselves,“ said Drake.

Although the old new logo
caused controversy with stu-
dents duc to its $40,000 price
tag, Drake tecls confident that
the new new logo will not. “Ear
sicaliy, we got an otter that was
too good to turn down. The
students will be very happy to
know that the new new logo will
only cost $20,00071lalfthe price

851%“

The college’s new $20,000
logo will replace

 

ot the old new logo, We also
hope that this will send a tiles-
sage to students that the admin-
istration knows a bargain when
it sees one," explained Drake.

The new new logo will proba-
bly be phased in along with the
new ”Star Trek" [orator boards
over the summer, “so students
won‘t be around to bitch at us,"
Vice-president Waldo Walker
explained.

Student reaction to the new
new change was mixed. The of-
ﬁcial response from SGA came
from Vice-president Ali ElSaf—
far, who commented, “What we
have hero is a case of the ad-
ministration making a decision
without consulting the students.
This does not represent it deparv
ture from normal procedures, so
what’s the. uproar about? i'm
used to it by now, So should you
be." ElSaﬂ'ar’s remarks carried

forcefully that theinsigniasiuacke just a hint of frustration.

snarled back.

Tombstones Attack Campus

by spunky Pni'vis

Plans have begun tor the erecc
tiorr otan additional tour: signs
on the Grinnell College Cam»
pns. Tire signs will be or
the “tombstone" variety already
seen about the campus. The
signs will be erected around
campus by the end of the
semester, according to President
Drake. The signs will mark such
sights as the laundry rooms,
all the streets, favorite student
protest areas, Hector‘s, and the
trees. Also to bc erected are
ten 50-foot map signs, showing
a detailed layout of all the tar.
ict facilities on campus and what

to do in case of a ﬁre. When
asked about the need (or more
signs on campus, art adiiiiilisc
tration spokesman said, “Boy,
you know, signs are a part of
our culture A sign tells you
where you’re going, it tells you
what's up. The more signs the
better!” The new signs are
prcdicted to raise enrollment of
freshmen at Grinneli by 60 per-
ccnt, according to a conservative
estimate. Tuition is estimated
to increase by a comparable
amount as an additional result
oi' the new signs. Vicecpresident
Wally Walker said in defense of

the signs, “We can’t lose our
number-10 spotl" rercrring to
the place the college holds in
a reputable magazine poll, He
added, “With this increase in
the number or signs on cam.
pus we could jump up to num.
ber nine, or maybe even eight!
Arid the new signs will cut our
electric lighting costs: they iigirt
up! No morc street lights!" Per-
haps the most important reason
for the plethora of signs is exs
pressed by all anonymous acl»
llliriistratioii ilierliber; “Heck, if
we’re in the middle of nowhere,
we may as well mark it!"

The major complaint of stu-
dents is that the new new
logo resembles the old new, logo
too closely to warrant spending
$20,000 on it. The only de»
tcctable ditierence between the
two logos is the change trorn
a single laurel leaf to a dollar
sign. Richard hidgeway, direcs
tor otpubiic relations, explained
the concept behind the new new
logo change.

“We felt that the new new logo
should in some way reﬂect the
old new logo. After all, we did
spend $40,000 on it. We decided
to stay with the "bar“ motifbe~
cause it not only symbolizes the
moral strength of this institu-
tion but the favorite hang-out oi‘
the students as well. The lets
tering was too cool-looking to
change so we decided to alter
that dumb little leaf. I never did
like that damned thingaaiways
thought it looked just like a
pair of lips. Anyway, the dollar
sign better symbolizes what this
school stands for and it kind of
represents the trustees’ pliilosos
plry, too."

When asked what would lie»
conrc or the old new logo,
Ridgeway responded, “Well, at
the moment we’re thinking or
selling it to another school.
So far, we’ve had several of-
t’ers, sortie even from our rival
scliools on the US. News and
World Report survey.” Ridge
way stressed howcver, that none
of the schools in competition
with Grinnell would be sold the
logo bccanse such action would
give them a strong competitivc
edge in marketing and could en.
danger Grinnell’s already pre-
carious standing in the top 10.
