president Ali ElSattar. Election Board patterned much at the forum atter the Des
Moines Register’s presidential debates, having each of the candidates ask a question at
one of his/her counterparts. Because no candidate garnered a maiority ot the votes, a
runoff election between the top two candidates, Jettt Fields and Rob Ki ion, is being

sexual Harassment
Evident at Grinnell

by Julie Slivinsky

' A car full of males honking ata
female as she walks down the
street

‘ Unwanted. sexually sug-
gestive computer mail

‘ Unwanted sexual advances

The common denominator for all
of the above is that they are forms
of sexual harassment, a problem
the National Organization for
Women lNOWl says is widespread
on the national level. According to
some Grinnell students. it is
prevalent at Grinnell.

“Sexual harassment is definitely
a problem on this campus,” says
Theresa, a sophomore. When ask-
ed to discuss a specific incident of
sexual harassment, she responds,
“Which one?" She describes one
incident that occurred at a party
last semester. “This guy was very
nice. I‘d never seen him before, but
when he suggested we go to his
room with some other people to get
high, I said OK. Well, the other
people smoked and left." When he
started to make sexual advances
on her, Theresa says, “I told him I
was a lesbian to protect myself,
but he Jumped me anyway." For-
tunately, Theresa says, she
escaped unharmed.

Theresa's experience is not
unusual. According to NOW, ”at
least 50 percent of all working
women experience sexual harass-
ment," which is defined as
anything “from having to look at
pornographic pictures on the wall
to sexual advances."

Although Now says so percent of
all sexual harassment is male-to-
female, Nick, a sophomore, is part
of the other it] percent “It also
happens to men. I know it does
now,” he says, and describes an in-

cident that happened last
semester. “My floor has two par
ticular freshmen girls. One started
saying that I had a nice ass, and it
kept building from there." Nick
says lhal along with verbal harass-
ment, someone wrote graffiti
about him on the bathroom Wall at
Burling Library. “But the worst
was when they put up three pages
nl notebook paper on the wall in the
hall for people to write things
they‘d like to see me in." Though
he wasn't threatened, Nick says,
“I found itembarrassing. I'd never
had anyone say anything like that
to me before," He adds, “It was
not taken as a compliment.”

Nick did not lake any action
against the people Involved
because, he says, his case wasn't
severe enough, and “I'm not sure
what the policy is.” Theresa, too,
did not lake any action, because.
she says, “i thought ll would only
make the problem worse "

Brenda is a sophomore who did
attempt to take aclion against a
person who sent her sexually
harassing computer mail. “I was
on the computer, on Bitnet, and
this person sent me a message
from AVAX that said, ‘Hey, baby,
wanna gel nasty with me
tonight?’ ” Brenda didn't respond,
even when the person scnl her
several more messages. The next
day when she logged onto her ac
count. another message from the
same man appeared on the screen.
Since she did not know the person
who was sending the mail, she
says, “It did really bother me,
even it lhis guy was just doing this
as a joke, because if he wasn't, he
