- Blame 7

US. for

Spread of AIDS

by Todd Francis

The press oi a nation is often a
good measure oi current interests
among the public. If Costa Rican
newspapers are good indicators of
the concerns at the public in this
country. then one of the most
prevalent issues is AIDS. During
1987. over 200 articles and
editorials were printed in the ma
jor Costa Ricaii newspapers (about
ﬁve publications) These covered
topics ranging irom prevention
and supposed cures to public opi~
nion and speculation on the
original source oi the disease.

As of October 30, 1987, there were
42 known cases of AIDS in Costa
Rica.“ OI these, more than half
were homosexuals. and most at the
remainder were hemophiliacs. The
Costa Rican Ministry of Health
predicts |liat number Will double
every year. with about 400 cases by
the year i991. The Ministry also
estimates that ihere are currently
about 4000 carriers of the AIDS
virus in Costa Rica.

In response to the threat of AIDS
spreading turther through. the
Costa Rican population. the
government has begun a campaign
at education and prevention. This
campaign has included distribuV
tion oi pamphlets and bulletins, as
well as lnIormatlnn in newspapers

The Ministry has also organized
a campaign of condom sales. In
1956‘ it sold four million Condoms
to Costa Rican residents. In
dividuals can also undergo blood
tests and get health cards stating
that they (to not have AIDS or other
venereal diseases. These cards are
especially popular among pro»
stitutes

The government also attempts to
limit the spread of AIDS into the
country irom ioreign sources
Anyone applying for an extension
oi the 30-day visa must undergo a
blood test. Furthermore, Costa
Rica prohibits some shortrterm enr
trances in the country For exam-
ple. sailors are oiten not allowed to
leave ship when they dock at Costa
Rican ports,

Public opinion regarding AIDS
in Costa Rica ranges from
tolerance to paranoia. when 1 ask
ed my host parents in San Jose
whether they feared getting AIDS,
they told me that they were not
worried at all because they were
happily married,

But polls by the Institute of
Psychological Investigation at the
University of Costa Rica portray a
broader view oi public opinion.
More than 50 percent oi those who
responded expressed fear of ac7
quiring AIDS, and almost 40 per-
cent agreed that all homosexual

men should be kept locked up to
keep AIDS from spreading, Fur
thermore. almost three-quarters
said that they would not take a
guest irom a nation where there is
a high AIDS rate, such as the
United States.

AIDS paranoia is encouraged by
La Xtra, a popular San Jose daily
that resembles the National En-
quirer. La Xtra accompanies
every AIDS article with a sketch at
a skeleton holding a rapier. Beside
the skeleton are printed the words:
"AIDS: The Filth Horseman oi the
Apocalypse.”

Another popular theme in Costa
Rican newspapers is the question
of where AIDS originated.
Although the theories that the
disease came from Haiti or Airica
are mentioned, the most publicized
explanation is that the virus came
from the United States.

Several Costa Rican experts
have pointed to Fort Detrick,
Maryland 7 a military laboratory
that specializes in biological war-
iare — and its genetic engineers as
the source oi AIDS. One explana
tion says that the virus was tested
on human subjects, but since the
shortrterm etiects were not very
severe, the subjects were released
from the facility, According to the
theory. they then began to spread
the disease among the general
population.

Regardless oi where AIDS truly
started, many Costa Ricans
believe that both the disease and
homosexuality itscli came irom
the United States. Although people
here generally like their giant
North American neighbor, these
issues are among the sore points in
Costa Rica's relationship with the
United States,

"Aieeeee!"

Thursday night North Gym is
:Choing with the sound oi men
screaming as they hop up and
lawn. back and forth, slicing the

.liiiini. People wander over Irom
:he weight room and peek out irom
,he racquetball courts to see
what's the matter. But no one is be
ing killed, they discover. It’s only
the Grinneli Kendo Club hard at
work practicing one of Japan's
most popular martial arts.

Kendo is a iorm of "Japanese
swordsmanship, [It is] the sword
smanship of the Samurai.” e7:
plains junior Mitsuo Yamada, the
kendo instructor.

Originally the Samurai used
sharp, singlcsedged swords that
differed Irom European medieval
arms in that they were not
hiudgeoning weapons so much as
slicing weapons. The point oi ken-
tio was not to "smash with the
sword," according to senior Garth
.Ioncs. one of the club members,
“[but instead to] slice to a certain
depth and then yank it out.”

This slicing aspect determined
the type of controlled, rhythmic ex-
ercises that has characterized kenr
do ever since peace came to
Japan and the Samurai were oblig-
ed to turn to the martial arts ior
ritualized, non-lethal fighting.

Yamada notes that "kendo
became not only a technique iior
lighting] but it acquired an inner
part, a spiritual aspect" as well.
The Grinnellians in the club are
also tamiliar with this aspect.
Each work-out includes two
periods of meditation at the begin-
ning and end where students kneel,
kow tow. and empty their mind oi
thoughts,

Yamada, a native of Japan spenr
ding his junior year at Grinnell.
has studied kendo since he was in
junior high, a total of about six
years. Realizing that there was an
interest on campus ior kendo
lessons, he started the Club near
the end oi last semester. Currently
there are 12 members, two of
whom are iemaie. The major
limit' (actor has been a shortage
in shinai, the six-{oot-Iong, bamboo
sticks that serve as swords in
modern-day kendo.

Originally. Yamada did not im-
agine himselt teaching, leeling he
still needed to keep practicing ken-
do and improve his own skills.
However, he now sees the club as
an opportunity to test himself and
“to practice a kind of self-
discipline," he explains. “I have to

And the work-outs are tough.

Yamada has one major goal for
the club. He wants it to 1116 his
legacy to Grinnell when he returns
to Japan. “II the club disappears
aiter I leave, then that means my
ability was not good enough."
