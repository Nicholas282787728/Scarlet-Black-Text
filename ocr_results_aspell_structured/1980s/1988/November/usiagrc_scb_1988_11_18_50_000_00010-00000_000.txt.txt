A View from the Outside

With the U.S. presidential
election finally decided, and
George Bush on his way to a
term as president, the vast
majority of the American public
will expect and apparently hope
for little change from the previr
ous administration. A week be-
fore the US. elections, one of

Israel also held elections that
similarly promised and ultimately
resulted in little change from its
current administration, save for
an increasing shift to the right.
Unlike in the United States, a
change from the previous admin-
istration would have had greater
ramifications on the country's
future, and therefore, held higher
priority in the minds of the con-
stituency.

The Israeli electoral sys-
tem, similar to that of the British
Parliament, is run on the propor-
tional system where parties lather
than individual candidates are pit»
ted against each other. The party
(or coalition of parties that gains
the majority of seals in the
Knesset (Assembly) has the task
of forming the government. The

Likud, Israel's two major politi-
cal blocs, was the result of the
combination of the lack of a
decisive majority in the Knesset
and the new for bipartisan coop-

The term National Unity
Government has unfortunately
proved to be a misnomer for a
government that has achieved its
stated objective but fallen very
short in structuring a decisive
policy for negotiating the fate of
the Occupied Territories, Within
the last year, Israel's two party
chiefs, Shimon Peres and Yitzhak
Shamir, of Labor and Likud re-
spectively, have come close to

some of the conferees (i.e., the
Soviet Union) could use the con-
fcrcnce to force Israel back to its
pre-I967 borders. The Inner
Cabinet‘s debate of the issue
ended in deadlock and the pro-
posal ultimately failed.

During the last several
months of rioting in the territo-
ries, the two major parties, far
from striving to accommodate
each other, have been driven fur-
ther to the left and the right. The
final result has been a similarly
divided (if more largely conserva-
tive) government, and with the
increased power of the Likud

over Labor) and the increased
prominence of the the religious
parties, the US. peace plan will
be, if anything, more difﬁcult to

whoever he ultimately turns out
to be, will need the ability to

searching for a solution to to the
problem of the Occupied Territo~
rics, a solution that will help the
most people and hurt the least.
Above all, the new president
should have compassion for a
country that, unlike our own, has
not quite passed the test of
longevity and is therefore more
easily affected, for better or for
worse, by political shifts.

As a ﬁnal subtopic, al-
though next week I will write a
column in support of the legal-

few comments about the bust
that took place last week.

Can we say "just asking for
it" boys and girls? I knew that
you could, As a little him, there
are people who use drugs, do so
quietly. and don‘t disturb anyone.
Then there are boneheads who sit
out in the middle ofa dorm hall
with a bong for an extended pe-
riod of time, Let's try to figure
out who is more likely to get
busted, hmmmm? Although. as
you will see next week, I support
the legalization of drugs, I think
that people who would sit in a
hall where the whole world could
see, smell, and experience what
they were doing, deserve to get
caught,

See you next week.

We'll Keep
You Posted

Is it Friday already? I
won't complain, This week has
been as active as ever for SGA.
so I'll get right into the update,
A pop machine that makes
change will be installed on North
Campus this week. The Health
Center is buying booklets on
"acquaintance rape" which will
accompany study breaks on ha~

rassment education in the dams.

By the way, did you know that
the Heaith Center is giving out
medication? Tom Crady is get-
ting microwaves installed in
dorm kitchens by January or
February and in the houses by
next year. The Waltz went great;
thanks to the people who helped
decorate and clean up, especially
Dagmar Grimlund and Cindy
Jones, KDIC is holding a club
night next Saturday for everybody
on campus over thanksgiving
break. Pleshette Hamb reminds
us that November is Literacy
Awareness Month, so look for
upcoming activities. SGA is
currently working on renovating
its sports club program. They
are also looking into getting pa-
per towels in the bathrooms and
cable in the dorms.

At the next Joint Board
meeting we will be reviewing a
smoking policy for the dorms.
The Committee on Student Life
has worked up a plan where if a
student is asked to put out a
smoking device, the student must
comply or leave the area. Added
to that, the ﬂoors could hold
meetings to set stricter policies if
they want to.

The issue I would like to
take up this week is the use of
the many student services offered
on campus to take care of cone
ﬂiets between students. Last
week the police were called onto
campus, but they may not have
been needed. Tom Crady makes it
clear that police can come on
campus at any time, and the po—
lice will investigate any com-
plaint on campus if called, This
makes sense in cases of danger or
emergency, but when is it a good
idea to call and when should we
not? Dean Crady also makes it
clear that the decision is up to the
student; if you feel you need the
police on campus, then make the
call.

If you can put off calling,
our campus offers several conﬂict
resolution programs available to
sludcnls. These programs exist
so we students can work out
problems without getting any
body in any legal trouble, The
simplest way to handle a problem
with another student is. of
course, talking to the person. If

'that doesn’t work the SA is their

to mediate problems; in fact, the
SA on your ﬂoor is trained to do
that! If_it is a more serious or

personal problem then go talk to
your RA, Those folks can an~
swcr questions of school policy,
laws, or just counsel you through
the conflict

Most people know about
the SA and RA, but what about
conﬂict resolution beyond them?
The Office of Community Rights
is not really an office at all but a
team of students and Student Af-
fairs' persons set up to mediate an
trgument between students or
ﬂoors. These folks are very good
and very fair. If a problem gets
this far it usually is resolved in
OCR. Rarely, the Judicial
Council is used. Taking some»
one to J udCo is the second to last
step in resolving a conﬂict. A
team of students and faculty hear
both sides of an argument and
cross questioning on the issue.
Then the council decides what
should be done Sometimes this
results in some sort of punish»

ment that President Drake issues
which is recommended by the
councilt And, in the most seri-
ous of cases, really serious.
President Drake himself heads a
President's Hearing Board for re»
ally bad people (we don't have
any of those folks here this year,
sorry)

As you can see, students
are the people who control the
conﬂict resolution process in ev-
ery step except the most extreme
case It is all part of our self
govcmment system and philoso-
phy. To make the process work,
however, students must use it A
call to the police before you talk
to your SA or RA or, heaven
forbid, the person you have a
problem with can cause a lot of
unneeded grief for everyone in;
volved. The NCA accreditation
team here this week asked if our
conﬂict resolution system broke
down when the students got
busted in I-Iaines. Our only reply
to the question was that the sys-
tem was ready to help, but the
student who called chose not to
use it. Too bad for all of us

That's my issue. Please
feel free to respond to this or any
other issue SGA brings up.
SGA is also zl system set up to
help studenm. Remember to ap
ply for the Assistant Student
Coordinator position if you are
interested soon, and we'll keep
you posted, promise.
