to "runoff" a paper and print it
out.

Another difficulty you
might run into is creating a title
page and a bibliography. The
UC public library has a sample
title page and bibliography you
can copy right into your own ac
count
COPY [UCLIB.PUBLlC]
TITLERNO; TITLErRNO; and
COPY [UCLlBrPUBLlC]
BlBLlOtRNO; BIBLIORNO
You can then EDT these two
files, which contain lenghty
explanations, to suit your title
page and bibliography

Finally, you need to
'runoff‘ the paper, and prim it
out. First.
RUNOFF PAPER.RNO
/BACKSPACE /DOWN=2.
This command will automatically
include two extra blank lines at
the beginning of the paper, After

you do this, there will be a ﬁle in
your account entitled
PAPERMEM;

TYPE PAPERMEM;
and make sure it looks like the
way you want it to printout. If
there is a mistake.

EDT PAPERRNO.
Editing the MEM file will not
work. Once you have made the
corrections, you will have to re-
runoff the new RNO ﬁle. Once
you have a MEM ﬁle that you
like,

PRN PAPER.MEMt

A long list of options will
appear on the screen. If you want
the paper to print out on the
printer in the terminal room
where you are, just press return.
However, if you want a better
copy on a laser printer in
Carnegie or Burling, press "1"
and then either a 2, 4, 9, or 10
depending upon which laser

SCARLET AND BLACK

printer you want it to print out
on. Make sure you know where
the paper is going before you
print it out, because you will
have to pick it up. Once you
make a choice on the printer, you
will be returned to the main op-

tions menu, and you can press
return to print it out.

If you have any problems
don't hesitate to call a UC. Type
SHOW USERS
to see which UCs are currently
logged on. Pick up a phone in
your terminal room and call
x4923 for the YMCA, x4921 for
Darby, and x3370 for Burling.

The UCs are there to help you.

Forensics League
to hold tournament

by John Newmark

The Grinnell Forensics
League (GFL) has gotten off to a
rocky start this semester, but it
looks as if there will ﬁnally be a
mumament. Members were sup-
posed to attend a toumamctlt in
Mankato, Minnesota the last
weekend of Fall break, but they
were unable to obtain the money
needed for the tournament. The
trip was cancelled at the last
moment.

At the following meetings.
the GFL scheduled a toumament
for Grinnell students which will
be held following Thanksgiving
break. The 'toumament, consist»
ing of such evean as extempora»
neous speaking, impromptu
speaking, original oratory. dra-
matic interpretation. prose inter-
pretation. and poetry interpreta»
tion will be held the evening of
Novr 28‘ The winners will pre-
sent an exhibition for the rest of
the campus on Nov. 30 at 7 pm.

McConnell believm that
his qualifications as head of the
post ofﬁce, library/bookstore, and
his 20 years of dining service ex-
perience are adequate preparation
for the business dimensions of a
senior ﬁnance manager.

In the past 10 years, dining
services has added the salad bar,
the sack lunch program. a central
bakery, and has adapted to the
many dietary needs of the student
body, such as the vegetarian en-
trees. the trend to less fried food
and less red meat consumption.

However, McConnell
would like to add more features to
tlte dining halls after the renovar
Lion of ARI-l and the new student
center, “We must first try to
meet the academic and social
needs of the students. as it is
more imponant to receive a qual-
ity education." he said. Mc-

an intercollegiate tournament, the
organization, which includes ap-
proximately 26 members. has not
given up hope for attending such
a tournament second scmcstcrr

GFL also hopes to attend
the Midwest Model United Na-
tions Conference scheduled in
February

One of the biggest prob
lems the organization is having
is ﬁnding faculty support. In or—
der to attend collegiate toumav
merits, the League must provide
judges, Any interested faculty
member should contact Beth
Wodzinski or write to [GFL] over
the computer.

Any student interested in
participating in the upcoming
tournament after break should
Contact the organization immedi-
ately, Everyone is welcome to
participate. Weekly meetings are
held at 9:30 pm. Monday nights
in the Human Resource Center
(HRC)

Connell then would like to focus
on offering more variety in food
and improved dining facilities,

According to McConnell.
the current physical facilities
constrain the improvement and/or
addition of dining halls. His
long-term goal is a central dining
hall, blending the two sides of
campus. This, he adds, would be
considered on student support.
McConnell also hopes to
eventually add such features as a
speed line and 3 pasta barf
"Right now, because of our lim-
ited physical facilities. we have
no time frame for expansion," he
said.

McConnell expressed his
ongoing concern for the future of
dining services. "I'm not ever
satisfied about where we can be,"
he said.
