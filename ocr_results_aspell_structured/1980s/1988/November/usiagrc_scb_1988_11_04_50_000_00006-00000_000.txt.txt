Townsperson voices support for
Tyrrell in legislative election

To the Editor:

I have not written a lot of
letters to the Editor, but I feel
strongly that there are some very
important reasons for supporting
the reelection of State Represen-
tative Phil Tyrrell.

Phil's opponent says she
cares about farmers. Phil Tynell
demonstrated his concern for
farmers and the land by co-spon-
soring the legislation that created
the Department of Environmental
Quality that has protected our
groundwater. Perhaps that's one
of the reasons why he has been
endorsed by the Farm Bureau.

Phil Tyrrell's opponent has
talked about her commitment to
children and families Phil has
demonstrated his commitment by
raising seven children along with
his wife of 32 years and by sup»
porting in the legislature the val-
ues that have made Iowa strong.

Mona Bond talks about
jobs, but when it came time to
build a road to the Grinncll Air-
port, don't forget that she tem»
porarily changed her mind -- alr
most leaving us without a road to
an airport that has been a solid
contributor to the economic de
velopment in our area. Phil
Tyrrell has supported creation of
new jobs both as mayor of North
English and as part of his area's
economic development group. In
the legislature he has demon-
strated his support for programs
to help the Iowa economy.

Phil Tynell knows that to

keep the Iowa economy strong
we must keep taxes at a reason
able level. Phil is committed to
government that will serve the
people of Iowa efficiently. He

November

Students defend actions and
policies of the A.C.L.U.

To the Editor:

During the Presidential
Election Campaign, much has
been said both Pro and Con for
the American Civil Liberties
Union. This letter is intended to
perhaps clear up any misunder-
smndings.

The A.C L.U. is a notAfor-
proﬁt organization designed to
protect the Civil Liberties of
American Citizens. Their main
purpose is to defend those whose
Civil Liberties have been Vio-
latedr What are these Civil Lib-
erties? The freedoms outlined by
the Constitution. the Bill of
Rights, and the subsequent am-
mendments.

The ACLU. is non-par-
tisan. It is neither Democrat,
Republican, or anything else It
is neutral. It defends the rights
granted by the Constitution and
its ammendments regardless of
the positions supported or opr
posed by any political party.

When the ACLU. pro-
vides a lawyer to defend a person
or group whose liberties have
been violated, they are not
defending the person or group,
per se, but instead the actual
freedoms which they feel have
been denied When the A.C.L.U.
defended the Nazis who wanted to
march in Skokie, Illinois in the
1970s, they weren‘t declaring
support for the Nazi Party, They
were defending the right of any
American Citizen to "assemble
woefully." The Nazis wanted to
stage a peaceful demonstration,
which the Constitution declares
they have the right to do. The
A.C.L.U. made sure the Nazis
were allowed to march, since it

as and still is their belief, as it
was the belief of founding fathers

such as Thomas Jefferson, that if
one person‘s or group's rights are
violated. it is a lot easier for
someone else‘s to be. If it be-
comes legal to say one group
shall not have the right to Free
Speech, there is no way to stop
the denial of Free Speech to other
groups. The domino effect. and
civil liberties, do not mix well.
For similar reasons, the
A.C.L.U. is now against movie
ratings and a ban on pornogra-

phy. This does not mean, as
some have recently claimed, that
the A.C.L.Ur supports pornog-
raphy and 6-year»olds seeing X-
rated movies. The A.CrL.U. is
just against all forms of censor-
ship. Banning pornography is
obvious censorship. Rating sys-
tems placed on movies are more
subtle, but are still considered
censorship by many. No forms
of censorship can be allowed if
we want the First Ammendment
to continue standing. If you
don't want your child seeing
nasty movies, take a dose of
parental responsibility. and check
out the movie before you allow
your kid to see it. This is the
parent's responsibility, not the
govcmment‘s or some other or-
ganimtion.

The other major argument
brought out against the A.C.L.U.
during the election has been made
most strongly by Dick Thom-
burgh, the new attorney general
of the United States. A former
member of the A.C.L.U. he has
stated that his reason for departure
was the A.C.L.U.s entrance into
politics. However, if there is a
bill in congress that would help
the progression of civil liberties,
it makes sense for the A.C.L.U.

to support it. Conversely, if
there is a bill that will harm civil
liberties, the A.C.L.U. should
fight it. Similarly, many
thought the appointment of Bork
to the Supreme Court would se<
riously threaten civil liberties.
The fact that the A.C.L.U.
fought the appointment should
come as no surprise. However.
no matter where you stand on the
A.CrL.U,'s entrance into politics,
that is no reason to discard the
entire organization. The
ACLU. is actually two organi-
zations. one which does the lob-
bying, and the other that provides
lawyers for civil liberties cases.
A member can belong to one and
not the other. Your membership
dues, and contributions, thus go
where you want them to. Fi-
nally, the A.C.L.U. is what its
members make of it. If Conser-
vatives distance themselves from
it because it is getting too lib-
eral, it will only become more
liberal. However, if Conserva-
tives and Liberals are both active,
a balance can be maintained.
If you want to become a member,
call the national ofﬁce at l-(212)-
944-9800 or the Iowa office at 1.
243-3576. We. the undersigned,
are already members, or are in the
process of becoming members.
Support the rigth granted by the
Constitution and the Bill of
Rights. Support the A.C.L.U.

Reader questions facts in
Halloween, feature article

To the Editor:

In last week's article on
Sarnhain the author demonstrated
severe lack of research into the
event

Britons at no time wor-
shiped a god named Baal. Fur-
thermore the reporter also dis-
played a lack of knowledge of the
Old Testemcnt wherin Baal is
worshiped. Baal is an acient
MiddchEastcrn god. It was
Abraham and his followers who
fought against the worshipers of
Baal and began the Judw—Chn's-
Lian tradition.

Samhain is a celebration of
the harvest and the death of the
Great God. It is also the time of
conception of the God, who Will
be reborn at Yule. Thus
Samhain represents the end of the
Great Cycle as well as its begin-

ning.

Please check the facts next
time. Ann Haker '89
Editor‘s Note:

I am no expert on religious
origins, especially Pagan and
Celtic religions, so before even
writing the article, I assure Ms.
Baker that I researched the facts.
She says that the Britons at no
time worshipped Baal. In The
Book of Hallowe'en by Ruth
Edna Kelley, A.M.. Chapter 2
"The Celts: Their Religion and
Festivals" it says, "Their chief
god was Baal, of whom they be-
lievcd the sun thc visible cm-
blcm." In Chapter 3 "Samhain" it
says, "On November first was
Samhaim Fires were built as a
thanksgiving to Baal for harvest "

I. to MS Halter.

e...edi,tor.., ,'»..

Celts, who were Britons,
worshipped a god named Baal.
Whether this is the same Baal
whom Middle-Eastem religions
worshipped would require more
research. I further assure her that
being a member of the ludeov
Christian tradition, I have a fair
knowledge of the Old Testament.
I gathered most of the
information for my article from
two books, one The Book of
Hallowe'en, and the other
Hallowc’en by Robert I-laven

Schauffler.
If she or anyone else has

any more questions about facts
contained within that article, I
refer them to these two books.
which can be found in the library.
