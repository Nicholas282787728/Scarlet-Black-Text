We'll Keep You Posted

Because Greg and I will be
appointing a new Cabinet officer
this semester (details later in the
column), I thought I‘d take this
opportunity to write about Cabi~
net and its role within SGA. Ah,
yes, Cabinet. That enigmatic
body about which everyone has
heard. but of which few really
know. The Cabinet consists of

Rob Killion

the SGA president and vice-
president/president of academic
affairs. both elected by the cam-
pus, the returning treasurer and
student coordinator (both having
been assistants the previous
year), and six other Cabinet
members appointed by the presi-
dent and vice-president/PAA:
social coordinator, all-campus
events programmer, administra-
tive coordinator, assistant trea-
surer, assistant student coordina-
tor, and parliamentarian.

Joint Board serves imporl
tant and vital functions within
SGA. However, the Cabinet is
the body that actually runs SGA
from day to day, In addition to
their regular duties, all members
are expected to be actively inr
volvcd in SGA issues and policy—
making. The Cabinet officers are
part of Joint Board, thought they
only have one vote as a whole
cast by the vice-president/PAA.
Cabinet meets alone weekly, ev»
cry other week with the deans of
Student Affairs, and weekly with
Joint Board. In addition, the
president and viccrpresideni/PAA
meet biweekly with George
Drake, the college president, with
Wally Walker, the college execu-
live vice»president and treasurer,
and alone with the deans of Stur
dent Affairs. The Cabinet offi-
cers are:

Greg Evans, the presi-
dent, chairs Joint Board and Cab-

inet in addition to sewing on the
Alumni Board and Committee on
Student Life. Thejob description
ends there because the position is
designed to give the president as
much freedom as possible to
tackle issues and crises that arise
during the year.

Rob Killion, the vice-
president/president of academic
affairs, as the name implies,
works within the academic sphere
of SGA. and, in fact, is the only
Cabinet officer to do so. The
VP/PAA chairs the Student
Council on Curriculum and sits
on the Curriculum Committee in
addition to attending faculty
meetings. The VP/PAA also
meets biweekly with Charlie
Duke, the viccvpresident of aca-
demic affairs and dean of the face
ulty.

.Ioe Lewis, the treasurer,
and Kae Bendixen, the assis-
tant treasurer, operate a budget
approaching $160,000. They
manage the funds of every floor,
hall, house, student group, and
SGA committed on campus. The
treasurers invest SGA money and
balance the main SGA budget,
the campus media sub-budget and
chair the Finance Committee.

Matt Rickett, the all-
campus events programmer,
chairs the All-campus Events
(ACE) Committee which sched-
ules every all-campus event for
students. The ACE programmer
manages the student security
force, checks out the SGA pop
machine and sound system. and is
the liaison with the Grinncll Po-
lice Department.

Dave Steinman, the so-
cial coordinator, books all student
films and concerts in addition to
acting as the liaison among the
Films, Concerts, ACE, Campus
Calendar, and Public Events
Committees.

in those counselors' refusal to
handle Grinnell's portfolio. The
loss of these investment man-
agers could be viewed as a viola-
tion of trustees’ fiduciary responr
sibility. However, members of
the Board of Trustees shall confer
with these investment counselors
in regards to the new resolution.
Although only one third of
the portfolio is affected by this
policy, the policy sets an impor-
tant new standard for divestment.
This new policy mandates di—

regardless of whether or not that
corporation owns assets in South
Africa. For example, although
GTE has sold its assets in South
Africa, it retains licensing and
distribution agreements with
South African corporations Such
a corporation would remain unaf-
fected by the 1985 resolution or
any similar, traditional divest-
ment policy. Such corporations
have now been divested from
Grinnell's stock portfolio. Stu—

administrative coordinator, runs
every election or all-campus vote
on campus. The AC also writes
and distributes the agenda and
minutes for each Joint Board
meeting.

Cathy Baldwin, the
parliamentarian, organizes every
initiative vote on campus in
addition to training the senators
every semester.

Dagmar Grimlund, the
student coordinator, and Cindy
Jones, the assistant student
coordinator, organize the Waltz, a
blood drive, a used booksale, and
a refrigerator rental twice a year
(one per semester). In addition,
they are involved with furniture
storage and SGA TV and VCR
rentals. Dagmar will be studying
off-campus next semester, so
Cindy will become the student
coordinator. We now need a new
assistant student coordinator for
next semester only. Anyone in-
terested in the position should
contact me at box 8-23 by Fri-
day, Nov. 18. Greg and I will
have interviews before the end of
die semester.

"Let's Make a Deal"

This week I am going to do
something I have never done be-
fore in this paper. I am going to
use the same topic for two con~
secutivc weeks. As you'll recall,
last week's topic was abortion,
and this week will be more of the
same.

I have a different focus for
you this week. I am not going

Mike Kent

to defend my beliefs. I am not
going to offer additional argu-
ments for the cause of the prorlife
movement. I am going to offer
you a deal.

Let it be resolved that on
this day, the eleventh of Novem
ber, nineteen eightyreight,
Michael Kent presents this bind-
ing offer to every female person
who roads or otherwise becomes
aware of this column.

In the event that at anytime
during your premarital life you
become pregnant, I offer these
concessions in exchange for the
life of your child:

I. I will pay for all neces—
sary doctor's care up to and in-
cluding the delivery of the baby.

2. During the gestation
period, I will see to it that you
receive tutoring by the finest
students available in each of your
classes. I will see to it that you
also receive said tutoring for a
period of one month following
the delivery of the child.

3. X will provide a twenty-
four hour hotline that you may
call for any need that may arise.

4. I will personally see to
it that your child is adopted by a
loving and caring family, care—
fully screened and fully capable of
raising your child in a happy,
healthy, environment.

5. I will assist you in eve
cry way possible to conceal your
pregnancy from your parents,
relatives, and friends, as much as
it is possible.

6. Being as the only thing
remaining is for you to carry the
child in your body for nine
months, and I am unable to re
lieve you of that duty, I will offer
you compensation in the form of
five hundred dollars cash to be
given to you upon the safe deliv»
ery of your child to his or her
adoptive parents, This sum may
go up as ability to pay increases
but will never be lower than the

amount offered now,

This offer will be valid
from this point forward. To enter
into this agreement, contact
Michael Kent; I'm in the student
directory.

Life is more precious titan
any amount of money.

The second part of this
column is my alternative to the
abortion controversy. At the
University of Connecticut Health
Center in Farmington, successful
experiments are being can-led out
on a "contraceptive vaccine."
This is not to be confused with
the French abortion pill that has
been raising a fuss recently. The
researchers involved here have
developed a vaccine that causes
the body's immune system to at-
tack a protein found in sperm.
Either males or females can be
vaccinated, in either case
fertilization is prevented. The
vaccine lasts about eleven
months, and after that time, ferr
tility is restored.

How about if we make this
vaccine available for free to all
people, starting at age twclve,
regardless of sexual activity. We
then keep records just like for
tetanus shots, and allow aborr
lions only for people who are
current on their vaccinations. If
someone wants to have a child.
they just don't go in for their
booster, wait a while, and they
can have a child, no problem. It
will also insure that parents
spend some time hinking about
their responsib ties and re
sources, making sure that they
can afford to be parents. No
pills, no interruption, you can
still get an abortion in the event
of failure (it has, however, been
100 percent effective in the labo-
ratory). Best pan of all is that it
prevents fertilization, so you
aren‘t killing anything.

It will be a while before
this vaccine is perfected, but it
will definitely be within our life-
times. At least think about it.

Note, the source for this
column was a news article re-
leased by the Associated Press. I
have the article available for any
one who would like to see it.
The head researcher of the vaccine
is named Paul Primakoff.

I'll get a new topic next
week, I promise. Maybe some-
body should sponsor an abortion
forum.
