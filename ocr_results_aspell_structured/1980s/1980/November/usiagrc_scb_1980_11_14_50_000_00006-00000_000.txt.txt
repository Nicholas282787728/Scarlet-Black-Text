FOG fast

by Wendy Babb!"

Food of Grinnell (FOG) will host its
semi-annual fast on Friday, Nov. 21.
Students who sign up to participate in
the fast will forfeit their dining hall
privileges and, in effect, will be
donating $1.25 per person to the Health
Care Loan Fund. Signaup sheets will be
available outside the dining halls each
night at dinner unn‘l Tuesday, Nov. 18,

For the first time, Grinnell students
will benefit directly from the FOG Fast.
in the past, the money has gone to such
groups as Easter Seals, the Uncle Sam
Club, Cambodian refugees, and tar
polio shots in Latin America. This
year there was in increased use or the
Health Care Loan Fund, due to increase
ed medical cosLs and more publicilty
about the program. Because of the in
creased use, the fund is presently out or
money.

The money from the fast will go to the
Health Care Loan Fund, which is
managed by the college. This fund
enables students at Grinnell to obtain
temporary loans ior such things as
medical exams, x-rays, lab tests, den-
tal work, glasses, minor surgery, etc.
There is no interest on these loans. The
only requirement is that the student
pay back the loan as soon as possible. _

In the past, the Student Coordinator's
Office organized the (ass and donated
the fund to various organizations. Since
there was no obvious cause for the fast
this year, the Coordinator's Office ap»
proved the Office of Student Affairs'
idea to use the money for the Health
Fund.

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
Susan Wittpenn explained, "It's
Something that’s available to any of the
(the students). There are lots of
students who have benefited from the
fund, We certainly need it
desperately need it."

This year students might have an axe
tra incentive to join in the FOG Fast.
The date of the FOG Fast coincides
with the date of the Renaissance Feast.
Because Cowles will be the only dining
hall open on the date, due to the shut-
ting down of Quad for the feast,
students might decide that the wait in
line is not worth it and Join in the fast.

Also helping with the fast is the
Women's Group. Coordinator Mary
Schultze stated, “It‘s a good idea. Any
student that fasts and thereby con-
tributes to die loan fund is ulumately
provxding for his/her own health care."
