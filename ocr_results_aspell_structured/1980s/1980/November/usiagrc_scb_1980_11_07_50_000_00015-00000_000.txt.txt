Davud Molho's "The Quest for

Dear Edllor:

In ”'l‘ht Quest for Knowledge” David
Molho makes several sweeping
generalizallons about Grinnell
students. He tells us: "we are going to
lleece society" “we are in this game
for ourselves“ and that it is a given fact
that we are going to exploit our iellow

College student as a walking computer

vinCed fhal Grinnell students are as ops
portunlstlc and selfrservlng as Mr.
Molho describes l \\ou1d promptly

Mr, Molho anlICipales lha others will

college. so it this letter rellects any
education at all, then it reilecls one than
i acquired previous to coming here On
the other hand, I hope Mr Molho's
statements are not expressxons of ideas
that he has learned at Grinnell, [or if
they are pcrhaps I should go elsewhere,

Scarlet and Black,

To the Editor: David Molhn's world
of Ivy League grad schools, Brooks
Brothers suits. condos in Lake Point
Tower, and summer houses in Ken-
nebunkport may indeed be a faithful
representation of the 'traditional
American idea or success, not his por-
trayal of this world as all that
motivates Grinnell students. r anyone
else tor that matter) is thé’height or
solipsism since Molho evidently can t
imagine anyming meanin ul beyond
his own material comiort,., e wrongly
lalbelt consistently) concludes that his
motivation: are the motivations of all,
Molho believes that “altruism is gar-
bage”, therefore, the truth is "that we
are all in this game for ourselves.”
Molho's opinion Is thus ordained univer-
sal truth by the simple condition or his
beliel’

This devotion to the self as ultimate
purpose and exclusive proof is natural-

ly tied I suppose to the conviction that
life is a “game." which the individual
mus “win by accumulating vast
amounts oi wealth, The objects of such
a “game" are bound by definition to be
continually elusive and devoid of any
abiding meaning. More generally, the
willingness to View wealth as an end in
itself leads to the complete devaluation
of the . human and environmental
sourcos of wealth as nothing more than
external means, useful only to the
degree that they serve the individual’s
evanescent fancy. If Grinnell students
are beyond‘the recognition of such sim— _
ple and fundamental truths, then
perhaps we are every bit the superficial
malerialiststhat Molho claims we are, _
My hope is that Moiho's article is an
atypical cathartic expression of guilt
from a conscience that apparently has
long been suppressed. 7 Chris

David MDlho's article emitted “The

Quest for Knowledge?" and indeed-

"feel compelled to write something in
rebuttal " However. this task his pro-
ven [0 be more difficult than’l’m’iy‘nally
anticipated because Molho’s essay is
not an argument; it is a ’series of
slanderous generalizations fotwhich he
offers no empirical support. r

In terms of rebuttal I might easily at-
tack trivtal points within theiasay such
