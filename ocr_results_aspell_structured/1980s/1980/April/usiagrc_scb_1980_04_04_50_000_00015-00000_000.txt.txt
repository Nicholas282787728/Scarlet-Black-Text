Reexamini'ng our patriotism

Being removed ii-oni American
society has allowed me to analyze
America irom a new, more critical
perspective. There is a lot oi good to
be found in American culture But
there is bad. too. What worries me
now is the sense of national-hysteria
that has swept the United States. Our
nationalrhysteria is rooted in
patriotism. I believe that our loyalties
have been misguided and misused. We
must all be wary oi calls to arms by
the American government and press.
We must all be more aware of who
and what we are in the world com-
munity.

American patriotism should not he
unequivocal support tor the American
government—at any time. American
patriotism should not be denunciation
of other peoples, simply because they
follow poliCies contrary to our own.
What is needed is a new definition of
patriotism in the 20th century.

In the 20th century, with the advent
oi the technological and corporate era,
government has become a huge un-
wieldy bureaucratic machine whose
primary aim is the perpetuation oi its
own interests, The individual no
longer has any real iniluence in policy
decision making. Practically speak»
ing, the individual serves oig govern
ment through the collective unit.
rather than the government serving
the individual. We have all become
“cogs in a gigantic bureaucratic
machine.”

Big government is a necessary by-
product oi the increased complexity
and specialization oi society in the
20th century. It certainly is not all
bad. I, ior one, approve or the concept
of a national welfare system. Never-
theless, there are a number of bad
aspecm to its corporate structure.
First among these is the tendency oi
the corporate structure to become in-
creasingly unresponsive to any inter-
nal moral Check on its behavior.

This is precisely where the in-

making process. Only the individual
can be moved by a powerful moral
sense of obligation to himself and the
rest of humanity. The American peo-
ple must, to the best of their abilities,
individually strive to both be aware of
their conscience and to act through
their conscience as a check upon the
dchumanizatiou anti immorality oi big
government.

Certainly, it is not possible to coin»
