An epistolary

Dcar Family, 9/7

letter short. The wealhel‘ has been
dreary I have been working very
hard in my religious studies class and
I thought I had discovered the meaning
of lite but I only got a B on the paper
so I guess not. Otherwise, classes are
nice. How is everyone? 1 went to the
Pub yesterday and drank beer. Gotta
go. Bluing siitldles is starting in
ARI-l,
Eondly,
Your son,
Mark
P.S Could you send me SID? I broke
some test tubes yesterday in
Chemistry Lab.

Dear Mark, 9/9

Glad to hear irom you. Your dog
misses you Everyone here is line,

better than [me I've really become
engrossed in Post-Kantian
Utllitarism and its inception in 20th

adding an independent in it because I
had to drop Intro to Econ. The prot.

Iwrote them while I was high and
