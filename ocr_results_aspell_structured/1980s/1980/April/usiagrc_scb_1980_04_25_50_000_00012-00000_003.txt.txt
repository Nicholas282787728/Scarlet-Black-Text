Morningstar in
Negative Space

by little Ricky Ricardo

Opening today, and appearing
through April 26, “The Faces oi Mar-
jorie Morningstar" will be on exhibit
in the Negative Space Gallery. Miss
Morningstar's onewoman show was
designed and produced as a senior art
project and represents 12 weeks worth
of preparation.

”I was sitting in front of the mirror
one day when Carly Simon s ‘You re
So Vain’ was playing on KDIC," she
explained, “and suddenly I realized
what my project would be.”

Miss Morningstar will maintain the
pictured expression tor the entire
length of the exhibit. Asked why she
has only created one expression, she
replied, “I felt that the best thing for
me to do would be to develop just one
expression that I ielt conveyed the
real me.”

The Adventures of Robin Hood :‘ The
same people who brought you “The
Wilderness Family,” ”Grizzly
Adams,” and “Snowshoe Thompson oi
the Rockies,” now bring you an even
more explicit and spectacular un~
natural film, “The Adventures of
Robin Hood:“ the story of one man,
pitted against the evils or civilization,
who ﬁnds comfort, solace, and
fellowship with a band of gay, merry
men thrust deep in the forest, Cruise
with Little John and Fryer Lawrence;
rob, rape and rampage with Robin;
muse with frustrated Marian. Thrill-
ing. Don’t miss it. Held over this
weekend only in Grinnell, Osceola,
Oskaloosa, Ottumwa and Bettendori.

The Wizard 0' Oz or “Dorothy Does
Dallas.” This is the story of an inner
cent girl from Kansas who grapples
with the whirling gyre or mental il-
lness. She imagines herseli in a land
called 02. There she reenacts her sex
ual fantasies with Glinda, the “good”
witch, a scarecrow, a powerful iion, a
heartless “tin" man, and (“0h, my!")
a thousand horny midgets. Very
Freudian.

Yes, this is the movie where you
hear Dorothy sing her torchlight ver-
sion of “Over the Rainbow" and
where she slowly recovers irom her
devastating illness by rollowing “The
Yellow Brick Road."

Alter the sneak previews, here are
what the critics are saying about
“TWOO.”

Mark Kaplan: “I don't know what to
say. Just make up Something really
clever so I look like a wit and I can
clip the article to send home to my

slanderous and Blatant

Debby Darge: “This movie is at
least as good, in dealing with mental
illness, sexual repression, and insom-
nia, as “The Man on the Moon."

Woodstock: The Bible comes alive
in this 20th Century version of the ser-
mon on the mount. With three loaves

of bread and three million hits of acid,

the multitude tall to worship Jimi
“The Savior" Hendrix and Janis
“Magdelene” Joplin who prays, “0h

This movie comes to us as a
spiritual uprising. A movie you can ,
really drop out turn off and tune into.
This film will bring enormous inspira-
tion, containing a message of hope (or
modern man.

With Joan Baez, “The Birds,” “The
Who,” “Jefferson Airplane," Priscilla
the Baptizing Nun singing, “Let me
wash your bonga-wonga’s," and a cast
of literally thousands. - ’-
