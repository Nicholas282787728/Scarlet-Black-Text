Hello! This week we decided to try something different and give
you a treat. while at the same time displaying some of the literary
and artistic talent here in Grinnell. The result is the 1980 Fall Arts
Supplement. a collection of poems, drawings, and photographs by
Grinnell students.

The poems deal with a variety of subjects, and may of them apply
directly or indirectly to the college experience. Some present a view
of the world from a perspective different than that which we are us-
ed to, others put common thoughts into new words. A few can only
be described as unique.

We’d also like to take this opporunity to thank all those people
who submitted items for publication, even those which we were
unable to use. The response was much greater than we had expected,
and we were able to publish only about one~third of the poems which
we received. However, a second arts supplement is being planned for
later in the semester. and we encourage everyone (this applies
especially to you closet poets) to submit works for it. We are also
loohing for short prose, line drawings, and black and white
photographs.

We hope that you enjoy this feature. Pleasant reading.

The Rose

She reaches out her lovely arms
declaring complete softness;

She beckons with her subtle charms,
Fragrantly revealing.

Touching softness as she tempts,
She causes dire pain.

With airs and beauty she attempts
to sooth the pain she causes,

And, once again, she begins

to tempt, to torture and appease,
For she knows her sins.

Excused by bitter beauty.

—Debby Fett
