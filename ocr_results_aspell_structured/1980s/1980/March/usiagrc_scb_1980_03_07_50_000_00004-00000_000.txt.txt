Chairman of the Faculty nominar
tions and discussion about the grading
system occupied the majority of
debate at Monday's faculty meeting.

Literature Professor Jim Kissane
and French Professor Morris Parslow
were the top two vote gctters [or the
position, Final balloting is being con-
ducted this week and the 5&3 will
publish the name of the new chairman
next week.

Dean Walker reported that the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing would
recommend no major changes in the
grading system unless the faculty die-
tates that some action be taken. He
remarked that. “We're sitting there
wondering where to go but we just end
up in a stalemate."

Debate was then opened to the floor
where Jim Kissane said the faculty
should discuss more basic questions of
the whole grading system. “We don't
talk about what grades are," he said,

Natker resigns; cites conflicts

by Andrew Schultz

SGA Adminsti-ative assistant and
election board chairman Maris Natker
resigned those positions as of March 2.
Naurer cited conflicts with SGA presi-
dent David Kramer and difficulties
dealing with the campus media as
reasons for her resignation.

Natker’s election board also resign
ed and the cabinet will act as teme
pol'ary election board until a new
membership can be selected.
Members of the resigned board wore:
Cindy Cisar, Patsy Haggarty, Bob
Kieine, and Neeta Sil'ur. Kleine has
been asked to serve as temporary
election board chairman until a per-
manent chairman can be selected.

Faculty argues grade

“There is a disparate sense of
teacher-student expectations." He said
professors are squeezed between grad
schools and students, “What are
grades." he asked, “Platonic abs
solutes. a measure of good effort, an
arbitrary standard of each faculty
member?”

Professor of Philosophy Jack
Worley said, “We must justify what
we're doing. At one point we had four
diiierent grading systems in four
years."

Walker then asked whether the Com-
mittee on Academic Standing should
be instructed to work on a grading
proposal which would shorten the
period for dropping a course and also
reinstate the “F" grade.

The motion was defeated by 30-11,
with three abstentions.

Next, Professor of Physics Charlie
Duke and President Drake reported
generally on discussions with the
trustees On the subject of tenure,

Natker stated that she had problems
getting along with Kramer all year
and added that he did not like her in-
dependent style of administering her
position. She said she was “too
autonomous" for Kramer.

Kramer told KDIC that ”Maris
misunderstood various functions of
her position, it was best for all con-
cerned that she resigned." ,

SGA Vice President G.R. Turnbull
said thcre were “no spectacular pros
blems in getting along” between
Natker and other cabinet members.
He did say that there were “lapses in
the way t ings operated," citing as ex
amples the confusion of the nomina-
tion deadlines for preSidential and

Drake said. “Quota polic are not
needed at Gl'innell. On balance they
are destructive." He remarked that
while 52% of Grinnell's faculty is
tenured, the possibility of reaching an
unduly high percentage of tenure is
not pressing because a judicious ap-
plication of the standards will limit
the overall percentage oi ti'ntit'uil
faculty, Also, the college liasa iiuiiirai
or organic coming and going oi the
faculty. Arbitrary limits, he said, are
totally unrelated to the qualities of the
individual faculty members and are
diviSlvc. They alfcct the commitment
of members and ultimately hurt
teaching.

0n the subject of staff cuts, the
president said the administration will
not eliminate positions Without faculty
input. He emphasized that Grinncll is
entering a period of stringency but
that even with these inevitable posi-
tion reductions. the College will con-
tinue to provide a high quality educa-
tion,

vice presidential candidates, the dates
of the elections, and the handling of
the voting procedures,

”lt's unfortunate that she quit at
this time," 'l‘ul'nbull said. “It has
created unnecessary confusion about
the vice presidential election,”

The election for SGA vice president.
originally scheduled for March 5, is
being held in the Post Office.

Natker admitted that the shroud of
secrecy which surrounded the results
oi the 5 '0nd running of the pi'csldcn»
tial (2ch on was on “overreaction.”
She said it was a justllied reaction,
however. and that all worked out well
with just the election board chairman
knowing the official l‘L‘Sults of the nice»
tion.

Natker denied that KDIC News
director Dan Flynn's threat to take
Natker t0 Judicial Council for
withholding the results had anything
to do with her resignation, Flynn
stated that his proposed suit would
have challo god the handling of the
clcction results. He said withholding
the results was an infringement of the
media's First Amendment rights and
of the public‘s right to know.

“The precedent of letting a political
organization c what is and is not
to be printed is fi htcning and
dangerous," he said.

Flynn has dropped his suit in the
wake of Natkel"s and the election
board's resignations.
