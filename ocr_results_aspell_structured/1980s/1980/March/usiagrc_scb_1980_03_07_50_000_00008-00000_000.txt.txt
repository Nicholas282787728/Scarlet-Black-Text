So you’re an up-and-coming young
capitalist looking tor some extra cash
to tide you over these high interest
times. Forget about those “sure-bot"
investments like gold, ai't master-
pieces, or plastics. These days the big
bucks are in scholarships and grants

There's enough scholarship and
grant money floating around that
almost anyone or an institution in
financial need can c ate a tidy nest
egg. It's a buyer's arket, so shop
around until you ﬁnd the scholarship
that fits your needs.

ships and grants around these days His
elude one from the Ame can Podiatry
Association Meat Industries Research
Institution of New Zealaild. and one
trom the soastics (Epileptlcsl Society
of the United Kingdom.

Of course, most of these scholarships
are relatively small and unknown. But

“free-spirit” capitalist ivith a yen to

years ago, but it is becoming one ol
the more prestigious and sought-aller

The committee miervtews to ap-
plicants and eventually recommends

dream maker/breaker, says the Grins

“\vandei'jahr” or a break in which a
student can explore his special in-
terests Stuart commented that the
Watson has funded some wild ideas,
but the proposals “need locus and
discipline." The list of 1979 Watson
Fellows included such projects as
bicycling around the world, consider-
ing the importance of 2005. and ex»
