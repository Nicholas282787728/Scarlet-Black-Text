Kenneth A. Christiansen. Grinnell‘s
Norris professor of biology, will deliver
the next lecture of the 19mm Scholars'
Convocation program. The speech is set
to begin at H a.m. in Herrick Chapel on
Nov. 13.

Christiansen will address the topic.
“Evolution, Fact or Theory?" He feels
this will encompass a current concern.
“There’s been a good deal of interest in
the press lately about the teaching of
evolution; the president has even said
it’s a theory,” explained Christiansen.
“I’m going to try to develop a valid
analysis."

This is far from the first speech that
Christiansen has given to die college

returned for past harrassment’

The following morning, Montague tllr
ed charges against the two that had
returned to Norris. The first defendant,
who had not assaulted the R A, was
charged with trespassing, and
ultimately pled guilty and paid a line.
The second defendant was charged with
trespassing and assault. and pled not
guilty. Because of the unforeseen
delays, the court date was not set until
after graduation. Thus, the student
witnesses had already left tor the sum-
mer and the hearing date was postpon-
ed until this tall.

At the first hearing, the defendant did
not make an appearance. A later hear-
ing was held in magistrate’s court
shortly before fall break. The defendant
was found guilty on both charges,

“The main point of this case,"
reﬂected Monkgue, “is that it is feast
ble to turn complaints into legal
charges and to obtain satisfactory
results through the proper channels.
Students should realize that something
can be done and will be done about such
harassment." He continued, “It must
be understood that you need not put up
with any harassment or abuse."

“It is important lor the victims to be
certain ot the lacis," stressed Mon-
lague. “The more precise they are with
the details of the situation, the more efri
fective the results can be."
