bokonon

it may be true
that there is no purpose

but I need

the illusion of love
I cannot laugh

at unfunny jokes

—Christine Wagner

Blue eyes
reﬂections of summer skies
seen in every swimming pool
invite merry children
pale open doors
beckon all
the link to your soul.

September Light

Each breorh IS

taken deheotely

like o branch or goldenlod

showering sun~poHen m the havls on my aIms.

On a day so hght

I suspect the an was sub/'ect
to a change in constitution—
ether, or a sudden solunon
0/ sun and autumn,

My hmbs heme/e tor you,

Breath by qwet breath
/ breath my Septembers ovvoy.
The month / love most,

when r most love

rbreoth them away.
Igrve my love to the air,

to the Irght and the passing buds,
to the shy mornings

and the bravado days,

the bnllrant, bl/ming, Immng days,
days whh e W, unshokmg,
hght—

From other months / seize my breaths
They owe me,
[would not expect a lover rh November.

Now / would give,

shower you wnh sun-pollen,

send you Me tort apples

that / picked (ram an untended Nee.
Be your warmth and receive rr.

But you are not here.
September is my rover.

Do you dare lose
your blue eyes?
pretty windows
are they innocent?
do they dream
about 3 Lime spent long ago
when nobody called
but the wind?

—Eugene Gant
