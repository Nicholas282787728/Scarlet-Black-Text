Carleton Knotts

"The SGA Is out of touch" IS the
theme at Carleton Knotts's campaign.
He feels SGA has become too secluded,
"it doesn't extend any feelers into the
campus," he said. As an example, he
pointed to concerts “How does the SGA
know what kind of bands the students
want? I haven’t seen any question-
naires. Someone should be making an
attempt to tind out what the people
want."

Knotts also criticized the lack of in-
iormation about sea, saying, “There's
been no attempt to tell the student body
what the SGA is and who they are." He
wants “to let everyone know SGA is

their student government not mine or
any other elected officials. "

Knots wants to bring “new, fresh
ideas" to SGA, but added, “I would
simply be the microphone for the entire
campus. just letting the members of
SGA know what the student body
wants. "

Although Knotts' is a transfer, he said,
“That shouldn' t count against me.
Would you count it against a freshman
since it is his first year here’! lcan iden-
tify with the freshmen since it's my
first year here, too, but I can also iden—
tify with the upperclassmen since I‘m a
Junior."

”SGA hasn't failed,’Y he said in sum-
mary, ”but it‘s leaning that way."

last year the campus organization
Iowa Public Interest Research Group
\IPIRGt, concerned that Grinnell Coir
lege lacked a paper recycling program,
started such a program on campus. The
proiect was primarily run by the local
Explorer Post. Due to communications
mlxups with that organization, the pruV
yect tell through, However, the recycl»
lng drive began again this year on Sept.
29 under the supervision of [PIRG
member Bill ogilvie. The recently
united organization MOBE/IPIRG has
reinstated the program with hopes oi
institutionallzlng it

They contribute the papers to a

. communitywide recycling drive spon-

sored by the Explorers. The Explorers
receive compensation when they send
the papers along to another represenv
tative m the recycling business.

MOBE/IPIRG makes no profit from
the recycling venture. Rather,
members hope the program will make
the college community more aware oi
the group's existence, as well as giving
them a project to devote their energies
to.

ogiivie said optimistically that the

recycling drive can be a very concrete
program." He anticipates more sup—
port irom the college community once
the program is running full tilt, In addi-
tion. he is hopeful that institutionaliza»
tion oi me recycling program will
awaken some of the “dormant con-
cerns” of other groups on campus and
inspire them to organize and act
“decisively and constructively."

Ogilvie comments that, though this
particular project is not an answer to
any major environmental crisis, it is an
active response to a significant issue —
Something he feels is needed at Grinnell
College.
