Rental fee for s

by Kathy willlioile

A policy that required partisan
speakers to pay a 325 rental tee to speak
in college facilities was changed alter a
meeting last Tuesday. Attending the
meeting were President George Drake.
Executive Vice President Waldo
Walker, Dean Catherine Frazer,
William Demii'lol'l, and Professors Walt
Stone, Mary Gibson. Al Jones, Joseph
Wall, and David Jordan

The rental fee was part oi the
presidential election year policy on
political activity, as explicated on
pages 82-84 of the towel Student Hand-
book. The political activity guidelines,
which were'tormulated by the presi-
dent‘s staff last spring, are designed to
preserve the'public neutrality oi the
college and thereby ensure its tax-
exempt status.

The policy, was established without
consulting students or the Committee
on the Program for Practical Political
Education, said William Deminoti,
Director of College Relations, because
it was based substantially on policies ol

previous presidential election years.
and therefore “the [eeling was that we
were doing something rountine."

The new part of the policy, item
number three, has proved controver-
sial. It reads: "In general, college
buildings may not be used for activities
such as political rallies or (underaising
benefits. However. whenever such uses
do not interlere in any way with the
regular programs of the college,
facilities may be made available on a
rental basis . . . '

While the Student Handbook menr
tions a rental lee, it does not speciiy any
exact amount, in practice, :25 has been
charged for speakers deemed “par-
tisan" by the administration. The col»
lege considers anyone running {or of-
iice a partisan speaker; the classitica-
tion does not include special interest
groups or other political activists.

while some campus political groups
have avoided the fee by circumventing
administration channels or by meeting
with speakers in the Pub or oil-campus.
the Campus Republicans, as well as
some laculty members, have complain
ed to the administration about the
policy. They said that the policy was
unclear and discouraged. rauier than
attracted, political speakers. “It's
tragic to stiﬂe those who, choose par-
tisan activity to express their
opinions,” said Ted Vlamis. head at die
College Republicans.

The rental lee requirement stemmed
irom Senator Edward Kennedy's ap
pearance on campus last lali, said
Deminoii. Kennedy's expenses, which
included security and a telephone bank
in Darby Gym, came to over 32,000. it
the college had not charged him ior it,
said Del-ninoll. “it could have been con»
strued that the college was contributing
to his campaign." Then, he said, “as
other candidates came along wishing to
speak, we had to be even-handed”7and
charge {or their appearances.

In retrospect. Deminofi admitted, the
rental lee policy "wasn't right." As a
result of the Tuesday meeting, the col
lege now extends a blanket invitation to
all candidates oi any party to talk

peakers?‘ a

belore the campus community, and
political speakers may now use South
Lounge tree ol charge. if, however. a
speaker requires an alternative site
such as Herrick Chapel or Darby Gym.
he or she may be charged any addi-
tional cost. Campus groups should coor~
dinate candidate visits with the PPPE
Committee.

It is Deminoll's understanding that
rental lees will be charged {or political
meetings which are closed to the
general public "ll they are lormally
organized and held in a room usually
devoted to public meetings."

Any 325 rental fees already collected
this year will be refunded, added
Deminoii,

Another part of the political activity
guidelines which has aroused com
plaints is item number tour, which
stipulates that Deminoll's approval is
required for the circulation of political
literature through the campus mail,
and that all such items must include a
statement that the material is not paid
for by college lunds.

Earlier in the semester, there was
confusion over What constituted
"political literature," While Vlamis
had diiliculty getting approval [or a
notice or a College Republicans cook-
out, Demlnoll said that now there would
be no difficulty with such an item now
and the policy applies only to "om '
campus lund-ralsing literature" and
“propaganda pieces."

which partisan politics have led to pro-
blems. Demlnoii, who edits the Memo.
allows the inclusion of items calling for
meetings on campus with particular
candidates, but "made clear that Janet
Carl lASSociate Dean of Students Al-
fairs and candidate {or the stale
legislaturel couldn't use Menu) for her
lcampaign fund-raising) run."

He also withdrew an item regardinga
fund-raiser tor Gregg Edwards (Grille
nell alumnus and candidate for the
state legislature). "There is no hide»
bound policy ior Memo” lor political
items, said Deminoll, "It depends . . . ll
an items is of interesl to a substantial
part at the campus. We will run it."
