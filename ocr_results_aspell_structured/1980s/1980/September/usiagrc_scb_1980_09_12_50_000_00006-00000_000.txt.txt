by Bob Flscus

Professor Joseph F. Wall, Rosentield
Professor and Director of the Rosens
[leld Public Allairs, lnternational Relas
tions, and Human Rights Program,
talked of the necessity tor passage oi
the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to
the Iowa Constitution in a speech given
at Herrick Chapel last Tuesday, Sept. 9
The Iowa ERA is to be considered in the
November elections, in which students
residing in this slate {or the purpose of
attending college may vote it properly
registered

When asked why he had chosen to
speak on this specitic topic, Wall
replied that the Grinnell Chapter at the
National organization oi Women
(NOW) had, several months ago, re-
quested him to make this speech He
said that this topic also fitted In very
nicely with the Rosenlield Program
and, in other remarks, made clear his
personal commitment to passage of
ERA on both the slate and national
levels

Wall preiaced his remarks about
ERA with the statement that it is a
“sorry comment on our society" that
someone should even have to get up and
argue for women's rights in 1980. He
ended his speech some three quarters
of an hour later by saying that a leading
supportér or the Iowa ERA had recently
told the state legislature that passage at
this amendment will make the state
motto, "Our liberties we prize, our
rights we ivill maintain,” truly mean~
ingiul ior all Iowans, The body of the
speech introduced a wide range of
arguments to show why passage of
ERA at all governmental levels is
necessary.

Wall talked about Abigail Adams' lets
ter to her husband, John Adams, some
three years before issuance or the
Declaration oflndependence,exhorting
him to “Remember the ladies" and to
earn the name "friend" rather than
"tyrant" from women, He mentioned
that John's reply had been that Iirst ap»
prentices and black slaves, and now
women, were becoming uppity, and
that men weren't [out enough to give up
their power, He quoted an 1852 New
York l-Ierald newspaper article that
said that women and black slaves were
happy in their servitude because it was
nature's, that is, God's law,

meeting began With the appomtment of
Craig Kirsch to the Major Concert Com-
mittee. The Profs in Dorms and RA

, Study Break programs received a $250
funding boost. The Joint Board discuss-
ed no new business and adjourned at
8:10 p.m,

Wall talked oi the Supreme Court's
reiusal to bring women under the pro
tection oi the Fourteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution, which
it belatedly did for black people over
two decades ago, its reiusal being bas»
ed on the political nature oi the equal
rights ior women issue and the pending
status 0t ERA, He told of a Supreme
Court Justice who remarked, after one
sex discrimination case In the
midsl9705, thatall women are paranoid,
always, believing they are
discriminated against.

Wall also mentioned the Republican
Party's repudiation of its toyear
support ot ERA and rejoiced that they
had not repudiated their support ot the
Thirteenth Amendment, which ended
slavery or the Twentieth Amendment,
which gave women the vote. Wall teels

that Ronald Reagan should support
Iowa ERA because he lKeaganl has
said that he believes that equality for
women is a state and local, rather than
national, issue, He lurther pointed out
that even Utah, ”that bastion ot male
supremacy, which has reiused to ratily
national ERA, has a state ERA." And
he noted that ERA has nothing to do
With homosexual marriages, forced
mixing oi the sexes in public toilet
Iacilities, or husbands no longer havmg
to support their wives

Prolessor Wall's main thenle was
that lowa, which was the lourth state to
ratiiy national ERA and has been
somewhat progressive in removtng sex
discrimination from some areas oi the
law, cannot wait lor ERA to become the
law oi the land because "Equality
belol'e the lav. should beabove debate."
