decreased to as percent, while the total
SGA budget has approximately doubl»
ed. “[1n the past] we’ve tried to get
more money, [from SGA] but our basic
problem is that SGA does not have
enough money," commented Nylander.
He cited the unaltered activity fee as
the major cause for the lack of capital,

“What we're doing is having fewer
major concerts and a lot of smaller
ones, We basrcally don‘t have the
budget for the major concerts we’d like
to have. A lot of the concerts we would
have been able to have at Grinnell in
the past are now out of out market
because our budget has not risen in con
currence with the rising costs oi cons
cerE,” said Nylander. He cited the
B-52’s, Talking Heads, Weather Report,
The Jam and Joan Armatrading as ex»
amples of concerts now too expensive
for Grinnell. Nylander asserts that if
the budget is not increased next year
the lack of funds will . . lead to
deterioration of the concerts program. "

This inadequacy or concert funding
extends back to 1979. Because oi the
limited budget. three weekends in the

1979-80 school year were left unschedulv '

ed, Also, last year only 27 concerts were
performed on campus, two less than the
year before. of those 27 cancers, 14
were under $1000 and six under $300,1he
two lowest price brackets in the concert
market. Georgia Dentel, Performing
Programming Counselor and Chair of
the Social Coordinating Committee
commented, “It the level of concert
programming drops further, the quali-
ty will be seriously impared.”

Other programs will also suffer dit-
ficulties. For instance, all SGA funded
student salaries remain the same as
last year, and money shortages will
also affect Loose Hall Ball, James
Gang Bang, individual hall funds, and
the Initiative Fund.

Though the 19mm budget is tight,
some believe they can retain the quality
of their programs. Ruderman said, “if
we [Films Co-Chairman John
Spackman and I] are frugal about how
we spend our money, quality can be re-
tamed." SGA Student Coordinator An-
na Marie Campbell remarked, “I like
the budget the way it is." Campbell

feels that if SGA is prudent, and Il
responsible people control the capital,
the year will go well. Though Nylander
is worried about the concert funding, he
,said. “There will still be good perfor-
mances. just fewer of them.” Billboard
Magazine once ranked Grinnell as hav-
ing the third best jazz program in the
nation, and Nylander would like to re-
lain that distinction.

However, he need to increase the ac»
tivity fee is recognized by the ad
ministration as well as the students.
President and Dean of Student Affairs
Jim Tederman feels that because of the
inflation-sensitive nature of the items
SGA spends money on, it. looks as
though an increase is necessary. Tederr
man and the SGA cabinet have been
working on a case to present to Walker
{or raising the activity tee. One or their
plans is to provide the Trustees with a
schedule of yearly activity lee ln~
creases for the next five years, Pror
blems which exxst this year because of
the unincreased activity lee could then
be avoided.
