“Emotional Rescue” needs help

by Michael Alexander

while being interviewed in a recent
issue [ll “Rolling Stone," Mick Jagger
said, "There is no lutui'e in rock Kl roll
It's only recyled past," in the case oi
The Stones latest album. this ls an
understatement Three years ago, the
group spent an agonizmg amount oi
time in the studio, ill which over 30
songs were recorded. The best oi these
tunes were released in the form ol
1978's "Some Girls," a very respectable
LP. Emotional Rescue," however,
represents a collection oi the dregs
from those studio sessions.

The record opens with "Dance," a
rather inoiiensiveiy iunky song that
would sound even better it it “as
covered by a group more suttable ior

"Respectable" from ‘ 'ome Girls " SO
tar, this 'rescue' sounds about as emo»
tlonally refreshing as a bowl oi week»
old cottage cheese.

The group makes several hall-
hearted attempts at employing new
musical styles within the album; disco.

It would be great to say, "lunny. lun-

be suspicious oi this lllm's success. The
iilm depicts gays as general audiences
may expect to see themvvery eie
laminate and dangerously tlaming, And
as Walt Disney would hasten to point
out. the goal 0] the lilm's comic strug-
gles is the straight marriage between a
curiously mute and uncomic boy and
girl.
