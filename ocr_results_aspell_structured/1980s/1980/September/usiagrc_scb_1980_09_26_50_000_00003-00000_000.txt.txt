Just very tortuoate, said biology pro-
lessor Lenore Durkee ot the $100,000
grant an anonymous priuute toundation
have given Grinnell College [or pure

The greatési part 01 the money, about
$54,000, will pay tor a new transmission

computer controlled. operant condition
mg chambers, and several other items
tor the psychology department; a
microhaiance and a spcctroplus tor the
chemistry deparmtent; and a video
cassette recorder tor the physical
education department All ot the equip-
ment is expected to arrive and be ready
tor use by the end oi the year, some by
the beginning or second semester,

Durkec explained some oi the advan
tages oi the new transmission electron
microscope over the biology departr

’ ar-old one. The new
much higher resolution
will allon studen|s to make much liner
distinctions, and under the must Ideal
conditions. it could produce
photographs of s ecimens approx-
imately three times as great as Grin-
nell's current electron microscope. The
neu scope will allow more efficient use
of classtimo since it takes only eight
seconds to change specimens on it while
it take three minutes on the other.

The particular model Gnnnell has
ordered, a Hitachi i-lxtio. not only pro-
duces and photographs inigaes of the
structure or a specimen, but it also has
the capacity to produce and photograph
three dimensional images ol the sur-
taces ot specimens when used witli an
accessory scanning scope Although the
college cannot at this time buy such an
accessory. the biology dep- tmeiit
hopes that it might in thc ruturc receive
tunds trom some agency to purchase it

The psychology department will also

an instant, which is necessary tor some
experiments on human memory.

The department is purchasing a pro-
Jection polygraph to replace the small
polygraph it now has A polygraph
graphs neurological responses to
stimuli. such as heartbeats and a pro»
jeeticn polygraph proyects the graph
onto a screen so that a whole Class may
see it.

The department's new microtome
will Cut very thin cross Sections of brain
tissue so that students may see
developments in an animal’s brain.

Also, with the Conventional audio
equipment it can now buy, the depart
ment W|ll be able to periorm ex
periments on animals reactions to
sounds. Brozoski explained that until
now the department was simply unable
to cover this very important part of
psychology except through the use oi
textbooks,

The department will buy an editing
Video Cassette recorder, with which
students can remove irrelevant
material troin tapes. leaving only iilm
which reveals psychologically reveals
ing behavior. In addition to these major
pieces, the psychology department is
also making some other minor pur~
chases

Brozdski thinks his department’s new
equipment will help it "give students a
representation of what modern
psychology is like." He explained that
tor a couple at years the psychology
department has been caretully
considering ways to improve the me
struction ii otters, through both cur-
riculum and and equipment, when this

money became available. Brozoski ad-
ded, the department sought to achieve a
"wide distribution oi application" of its
share of the money, so that the equip-
ment bought would benefit students at
different levels or concentrating in dif~
feren! areas of psychology,

The chemistry department is pure
chasing a microbalance and a spectmr
plus or pH meter and spec-
trophotometer combined tor the
biochemistry lab with its allotment of
the grant. The microbalance will ac-
curately weigh very small samples oi
substances which are often quite expen-
sive. The department has no such in-
strument now, although it does have
some general purpose analytical
balances.

The spectroplus will measure a
substanee’s pH and determine
substances by the quality oi light shown
through them. The department now has
tour spectropluses but has found that is
not enough in proportion to class sizes.
Chemistry professor Luther Erickson
said of these purchases, “We’ve offered
a biochemistry lab for some time, but in'
the last couple of years we have
remodeled the facilities and upgraded
the equipment.”

The physical education department
plans to buy a video easette recorder to
show students techniques and errors it
would otherwtse only be able to explain
to them. This portable unit can record
sound, although mat will usually not be
necessary. Physical education pro»
lessor Anna Waek explained that it
might be helplul, however, if used in in
struction in synchronized swimming or
a similar aetivity.
