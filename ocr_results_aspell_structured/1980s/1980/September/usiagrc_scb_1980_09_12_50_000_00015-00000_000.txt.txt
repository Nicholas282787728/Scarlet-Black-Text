no reference to any other minority

no phraseology as ”black candidates

The story of Jack

To the Editor: Debbie Malina‘s
editorial, Bliss in Grinnell, ﬁlled with
stereotypes. generalizations, and per»
sonal opinions (Le, she didn’t like
anonymous college because 50 percent
of its students are in the conservatory),
reminded me that I haven't yet Written
to my friend Jack. Jack had an 6310
perience similar to Ms. Malina’s. Let
me tell you about Jack.

Jack, a ireshman at Carleton College,
nearly came to Grinnell ﬁll all but the
experience he had while vi ting Grin-
nell last year convinced him not to. Last
year while a senior in high school, Jack
narrowed down his list of prospective
colleges to two: Carleton and Grinnell.
His mother advised him to visit both
schools telling him, “Jack, you must
experience a typical day in the life of a
Grinnell or Carleton student," Jack
always listens to his mother, so he set
. out to sample higher education.

Jack arrived on a Thursday night at
the Grinnell bus station, suitcase in one
hand, backpack filled with books in the
other, and met two Grinnell students
sent by the Admissions Office to greet
him. On their way to Rawson Hall, the
two students introduced memselves as
Ed and Steve, and offered Jack a joint
that they were passing back and forth
on a telescopic roach clip. Jack, a
straight A Student in high school, was
hoping to attend an outstanding
academic institution. and had the im-
pression that Grinnell was such a
school (he had read the Yale College
guidel. Needless to say, Jack was upset
about having to record this offer of a
joint as his first Grinnell experience.

After their arrival at Rawson Hall,
Ed and Steve convinced a reluctant
Jack to go upstairs to a party. At the
party, Jack grimaced in response to
loud music. saw two men pour beer on
each omer, stared in amazement as an
enraged man pulled a telephone
receiver off the wall, saw some jocks,
saw some preps. heard that the food
was awiul, and refused 51 beers and 16
joian. Finally Jack left the party mut-
tering under his breath, “So this Is what
Grinnell is like, I’m glad I came, I bet
ter write Mother and tell her I'm not go-
ing to school here.”

Beiore going to bed that night Jack
wrote his mother a letter, It read:
Dear Mom,

l'm at Grinnell and I've already

decided to go to Carleton instead All
the students do 15 party here.‘ I just
thnessed a bacchanalian orgy. I'll be
home soon.
Your loving son,
Jack
50 Jack left Grinnell without ever
talking to professors, going to classes,
or meeting students who weren’t at the
party. Now he attends Carleton He
writes for the school paper and last
week he wrote an editorial called. Bliss
in Carleton. In his editorial Jack coma
pares Carleton favorably to an
anonymous Small midwestern liberal
arts college where bacchanalian orgies
are the norm. . , After all, Jack did
spend a night at Grinnell, so he knows
exactly what it is like. He even sent me
a copy of his article. 1 think I’ll send a
copy to Ms. Malina along with Jack’s
