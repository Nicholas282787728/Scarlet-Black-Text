Two new

by Wendy Bobbitt

Within the next week two alternative
papers will be publishing their first
issues. One, the 3&5, is being
rosuscitated aiter its disintegration last
spring. The other, The Iconoclast, is
making its premier debut on the Grin-
nell campus.

Although the name remains the
same, Gordon Kurtz is determined to
give the 5&8 a new image. The bars, a
student»run literary publication,
reportedly has a reputation on campus
as being satirical nasty and apathetic.

Kurtz, who is co producing the paper
along with Cindy Gipson, ieels that last
year’s paper suffered from being too
egocentric and not well edited. Kurtz is
especially interested in ridding the
paper of its elitist image. He hopes to
include as many people as want to be Ins
valved; ideally, the entire campus.
Kurtz explained “I’m not interested in

presenting one View."

Kurtz says that there will also be a
slight change in the orientation oi the
publication. Kurtz wants the paper to
be ior the students to express what they
iccl about the campus as opposed to
what's going on The publication, an
alternative means oi expression, will
contain art, literature, poetry, and
editorials, Many oi the literary pieces
will be dadaistic or surrealistic, but
they don't have to be. Kurtz feels that
one of the major differences in this
year's nos is that hopeiuliy, most of
the works will be submissions from
students rather than staff members in
order to maintain a more objective
view. Kurtz stated, “The 3&5 isn't
there ior any particular orientation, it's
there to provide an immediate form of
expression {or anyone or everyone."
