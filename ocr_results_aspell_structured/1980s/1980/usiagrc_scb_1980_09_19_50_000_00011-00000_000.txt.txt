The “choices”

Although most oi us are already exr
hausted with the whole 1980 election,
one oi three major candidates is going
to occupy the White House for the next
four years, so we must arrivc at some
decision by 4 Novel" ber. Let's examine
the prospects

The incumbent is 2i man with a
remarkable lalenl for ineptitude ()i' the
two major areas in which a president
deals, Mr, Carter has been a failure.
The economy is going to hell in a hand
cart. and the nation's toreign policy is a
travesty

The Economy 'l‘lirec-andra-hall
years ago, the nation's annual inﬂation
rate was 5 percent to 5.5 percent. Today
that rate hovers around 14 percent In
Spite 01 this, the President tells us that
inilation is on the way down it is , ,
down from its itl percent high earlier
this year Mr Carter cannot play
semantics itith the annual unemployr
ment rate, though The Labor Depart
ment estimates that 7.5 percent at the
eligible work torce is unemployed, and
predicts that number will rise to bet
ween a percent and 8.5 percent by
year's end.

in short, the economy is in a
shambles. Mr. Carter has presided over
the worst economic decline this nation
has experienced since the Depression
To solve the problem, the White House
has Just submitted an economic plan to
Capitol Hillithe seventh one in three
years‘ Mr. Carter insults us with his
election year ploy. it Mr Carter had
any idea or how the economy works the
nation would have seen results of a
positive nature six or seven programs
ago.

Foreign Affairs To say the President
is a nDVice in the area of international
relations is to give him more credit
thali he deserves The Carter Ad
ministration has approached the lure
mulation oi us. ioreign policy with a
blatant disregard for the opinions other
allies. Furthermore the President has
sacrificed the credibility of this nation
For example. the “unacceptable" has
been torgotten, l reier to it Cuban

troops that are still in Cuba, 2) Soviet‘

troops that are still in Aighanistah, and,
37 Americans that are still held hostage
in Iran.

Mr. Carter does not think beiore he
makes policy His human rights camr
paign early in his term came down hard
on the Argentine government As a
result, the Argentines have paid back
the compliment by selling the Soviets
wheat, thereby undercutting Mr.
Carter's grain emhargo to that nation.
and the American tarmers are suffer-
ing in vain. The problem in the ad
ministration may be that Mr Carter
doesn‘t know who to turn to ior help in
formulating toreign policy, liugh Sidey
of Time relates that when the time
came [or the President to make the
iinai deciston as to whether to go ahead

with the hostage rescue mission, he
(Carteri left the National Security
Council meeting to discuss it with his
Wife The Presrdent returned in favor oi
the mission, even though the Secretary
oi State was against it,

in sum, Jimmy Carter and his
"Georgia Maria" do not have any idea
how to handle the economic or foreign
policy or this nation Mr, Carter's term
has been one blunder and embarrass-
ment alter another This nation cannot
arrord another tour years or Jimmy
Carter.

On the other hand, Mr. Carter's
primary challenger, Ronald Reagan,
has only one problem—his mouth. Mr,
Reagan has some good ideas, certainly
a good deal more than does Mr. Carter,
yet every time Mr. Reagan opens his
mouth he convmces more and more
people that he really is a brainless idiot.
In one week Mr. Reagan succeeded in
insulting the people oi Tuscumbia,
Ala; throwing a wrench into Sinor
American relations, and, declaring
that he doesn't believe in the Theory of
Evolution. when political pundits wrote
at the beginning of the campaign that
this election was (or Ronald Reagan to
lose, they were right on target, and Mr.
Reagan, true to Republican tradition,
seems to be snatching certain defeat
from the jaws of victory.

The best thing each candidate has go-
ing tor him is his running mate, Both
Waiter Mondale and George Bush are
bright, intelligent, effective,‘ and
capable men, one ot whom will be
wasted tor the next tour years. Unforr
tunateiy, Mr. Mondale has to delend the
Carter Administration's record—or
lack thereofiand Mr. Bush has to d »
tend or keep quiet about every stupid,
silly or inane comment or idea Ronald
Reagan makes or has. The two vice
Dresidential candidates are not in
enviable positions.

This. like every other circus, has a
third ring, Occupying it is Independent
candidate John Anderson. There is not
much to Mr, Andersonian assertion
that is supported by die tact that he has
named media consultant David Garth
as his campaign manager. Mr. Ander-
son gained support early in the primary
season tor supporting politically un-
popular ideas, and he became the darl-
ing at the press. Lately, though, Mr,
Anderson has not said anything new or
particularly interesting.

John Anderson may be, as James
Gannon of the Des Moines Register put
it, “ a silver haired orator with a
golden tongue and a 17 jewel mind,” yet
Mr, Anderson has not given the nation
any reason to vote {or him, other than

 

 

The best, thing each candidate

has going for him

is his running mate.

 

 

Mr. Reagan has been accused oi ot-
lering simplistic solutions to the pro
blems that lace this nation. There is
nothing wrong with a simple solu»
tionmthe complex solutions that have
been applied to today's problems have
not worked, so why not try a simpler ap
proach The .problem with Mr.
Reagan's ideas is that they are
vacuous. For instance: Mr. Reagan is
opposed to the SALT ii treaty and he
iavors development of the MX missile
system. But without SALT U the pur-
pose bchind MX is lost since the Sovtets
can build as many warheads as they
need to strike each [also Silo in the MX
system, thus assuring destruction of the
missile,

his name is not Reagan or Carter. A
candidacy based on media hype is not
what the nation needs.

The way i see the 1980 praidential
election, we have a choice of the
Democratic nominee, an
“inrmBHH—lnepl, incompetent, incon-
sistent, and ineffectual; the Republican
nominee, Tinseltown’s version of an in-
tellectual heavyweight, and John
Anderson, maybe the ﬁrst candidate
entirely formed by Fred Silvermam

It is said that God watches over
drunken sailors and the United States of
America, Given the particular cir-
cumstances ofthlselection.\vecan only
hope that someone is watching over us.
