Looking at SGA '

This week we take a close look at the SGA cabinet, those peo»
ple who work with the budget and are responsible for seeing
that Joint Board resolutions are implemented. The names
sometimes appear on memos and in the SGA news, and the
faces are familiar to many students, but not everyone knows
what the cabinet members are like or what duties their jobs en»
tail. In this issue we‘ve tried to shed some light on the subject,
and we hope that you find it to be interesting reading,

Invitation to discussion

Elsewhere in this issue, Kathy Willhoite raises some serious
questions about academic integrity in her letter to the editor
(Stealing grades in Grinnell?) Instances of exagerated
academic competition between students are becoming more
common. While some degree of competition may prod students
to independent thoughts and stimulate the educational process,
there is a point at which the competitive aspects begin to affect
the spirit of cooperation between students. When the grade
becomes more important than the material being learned, so
important that it must be achieved at the expense of others,
something is seriously out of balance. One can‘t help but ask
why such incidents occur,

We urge all members of he campus community to ponder this
question, for the problem affects all of us directly, Then let us
know your thoughts, we’d like to explore the issue more fully in
the “to the editor” section of the S&B.
