/ Fiery female

by Eric Rasmussen

Tantrum, a seven-member band out
or Chicago, will appear in concert this
Saturday at 9:30 PM. in Darby Gym.
This is one of the few rock'n’roll bands
around with three female lead
vocalists up front.

“Tantrum seamlessly (uses
rock‘n'roll in a visual, tightly-knit
s'how, giving the appearance of a
much older working unit,” wrote
Billboard magazine. “It you can pic-

, ture a careful blending oi Lesley Gore,
'Heart, Mott the Hoople, and
Downlinel‘s Sect, then you have the
idea of Tantrum."

There are at least two different
dimensions to Tantrum’s sound. One is
the ballsy, toughrchick rock'n'roll
sidemsexy, loud, challenging. and
secure. The other isn’t exactly all in-
nocence. but leans toward a less pro-
vocative manner; something you
could probably take home to your

' mother.

The group’s l'ormation didn't take
place among school chums or
neighborhood peers. Tantrum is a con-
trived band, Manager Joe Crispino en-

isioned a iemale counterpart to a
band with all the power of Led Zepr
pelin, yet not so rock-hard as to deny
the harmonic and melodic
possibilities.

.Cl‘lspino drafted the instrumental
nucleus of Tantrum from a local
disco/club band, Skylady: Bassist Bill

’Syniar, keyboard/writer Phil Balsano.
