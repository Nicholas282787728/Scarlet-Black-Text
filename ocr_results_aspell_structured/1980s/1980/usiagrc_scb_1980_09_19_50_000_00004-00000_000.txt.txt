Drake supports F—grctde

by Kathy Wil/horre

After a year of getting acquainted
with Grinnell College, President
George Drake has decided he would
like to see changes in the grading
sytem— specitically the reintroduction
of the “F" grade.

The question of whether or not the ‘F’
should replace the current ‘Erase' has
been controversial among faculty and
students since the issue was hotly
debated at a iaculty meeting in the sprr
ing of 1979.

Drake plans to reintroduce the issue
at changes in the grading system to the
faculty some time this year—once the
new dean, Catherine Frazer, "gets her
feet on the ground.”

Faculty feeling, says Drake, is
strongly tor the reintroduction of the
issue. but its resolution will be a dit
ticuit task. There is “a good deal of
dissatistaction" among faculty
members about die current grading
system but “not much consensus,” said
Drake.

In May of 1919, the [acuity Could
reach no consensus on a pro . sal by the

Committee on Academic Standing, The
committee recommended that the cur
rent ‘Erase’ grade by replaced by a "No
Credit' grade that would go on the
transcript but would not count when
ﬁguring the GPA.

The stalemate continued last year
with the Committee on Academic Stan-
ding refusing to recommend any major
changes in the grading system until the
faculty indicated what action should be
taken.

Finally, at the March 3, 1930, iaculty
meeting, "the ball was bounced in the
admlnlstration's court," said Drake. At
that time. the t'acully decided to assign
the administratlon responsibility tor
pulling together statistics on the
grading system, and for instituting pro
cedures whereby the taculty can
discuss the principles on which the
Grinnell grading system is based.

“It’s a faculty matter," said Drake.
“What Dean Frazer and I can do is pro
vide leadership."

The "educational defects" in the cur»
rent system are one reason that Drake

would like to see the ‘1‘" grade return.
Tile 'Erase‘ encourages students to
drop courses. said Drake, “And that, 1
think, is unsound education." He said
that ‘A' students simply drop a course it
they are getting a 'B' in it.

No statistics have heen compiled on
exactly how many students drop
classes and take an 'Erase‘. "How can
we know which students drop their
courses and which ones actually
tailed?" said Registrar Maxine Paul
But both Drake and Frazer assert that
many at the students who come beiore
the Committee on Academic Standing
do so not because of low grades but
because they are behind in their ac-
cumulation oi credits due to dropping
courses aiter the drop date and taking
an ‘Erase' Abusing the ‘Erase,' said
Frazer, IS not that common. but it‘s
consistent."

Another source Di concern [or Drake
is the threat to "the integrity oi the
transcript oi the college" which the
‘Erase' poses. in some cases, a Grinnell
