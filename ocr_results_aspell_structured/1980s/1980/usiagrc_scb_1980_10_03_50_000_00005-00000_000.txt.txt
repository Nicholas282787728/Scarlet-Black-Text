the doors at 5:45 pm. at Cowles and
workers were out by 7:15," said Abbie
Kleppa, a student worker at Cowles.
"Since lines have been so long, we're
closxng doors later and when some
workers must leave, the rest have to
work longer"

“In North they ve had to go to a hali'

meal system because workers can't
stay that long," said one Quad worker
who declined to be identiﬁed. “it
doesn't work out that well.”

"I had to stay one hour longer than
usual on the night Di that Oriental Bui~
iet because there were so many people
in line,“ said a Cowles worker who also
asked not to be identified, “We had to
close the doors 30 minutes late,” she ad-
ded,

Both Quad and Cowles have had stall
problems. "It may have been just that
day," Kleppa commented, “but once
Quad ran out of dinner entrees except
for one kind. It took ten minutes for
them to scrape something up. And this
was at 6:05," she added,

“My staff didn't handle that situation
very well and oats my tault," said MCv
Connelli “When serving new items you
never know what ﬁrings are going to go.
Normally we would have a back up, but
my staff was unable to do that."

The hiring at an adult supervisor in
stead of the student supervisors of
previous years has also created staff
problems in the opinions of some Quad
workers “For some reason Dave
decided students would not be meal
heads and he's hired an adult slafi' “
said a Quad worker who asked [Dr
anonymity because of an “enormous
potential for retribution." The worker
went on to say, “This person at Quad is
not adequate and doesn‘t know me stu-
dent job responsibilities. Consequently,

- a large number of freshmen workers
haven t been trained correctly"
‘Having someone be the supervisor
.who hasnl done the jobs herself and
doesn thave an understanding of them
is part of the problem," said another
Quad worker) ‘ ”The attitude around
Quad itselt has changed, brought up a
lot of tensions. I don't know it it has
been a change in attitude in Dave MC»
Connell or what." she said,

When asked about the new policies.
McConnell stated, "We just decided to
change it to get more effective use of
personnel. We still have upperclass
students to help out the freshmen."

McConnell sees the problem as “hav-
ing some senior students who are
negative to the whole approach, but
then students don't like change and I
think it will get better with lime." Mc-
Connell cited the improvement in the
managing oi the salad bar as an exam
ple of how the new supervisor has
helped, PreVlously. “the students doing
the job might have been sitting around
with friends.” he said,

in addition to supervisory problems,
two student stall members have recentr
ly been taken off jobs that involve
relating to customers because or map
proprlate attitudes. According to MC»

October 3, l980

Connell, their behavior wasn't proper,
The students were given the option of
being assigned to jobs that didn't in-
volve relating to customers, but both
have since quit "i was making a joke to
a girl about one or my hairs which had
accidentally gotten on a plate and she
got disgusted,” said Alice Mclntyre,
“She told Dave and he reasoned that I
had the wrong attitude. I was taken oil
all my line jobs so that l wasn't relating
to customers."

8 GA news

by Barb Rilter

Joint Board last Wednesday night ap
proved a total of $550 in response to
three separate requests by campus
organizations.

The Concerned Black Students (CBSl
asked for $200 from the SGA to aid in
financing Black Cultural Weekend. The
$200 will fund a speaker for the
weekend. As CBS has already raised
$1,265 in an effort to reduce their SGA
request, Joint Board held little debate
before unanimously approving the re-
quest,

A request lor $720 was made by the
Societ for Creative Anachronism (SCAl
in order to offset expenses of the society
this semester, The Finance Committee
recommended that SGA approve only
$125 to SCA for several reasons and
cited several instances where the SCA
could cut costs, consider alternate
financing, and perhaps place some of
the financial burden on the members
themselves. After some discussion, the
motion was amended to support
Finance Committee's recommendation

_ of $125 and was approved unanimously,

The remember Men's Volleyball
Club was represented by Jim Hunter in

_-their request tor $540 from the son.

Once again, the Finance Committee’s
recommendation of $200 for the club
was acted upon, The allocation 01 $206
to the club will allow it to pay League
fees and participate in their tour-
nament—all other funds should be
sought from alternate sources

ln other SGA business, Missy Bowen
was approved to the spun and Tom
Dahl, Barry Litt, Steve Mondschein,
and Jim Bowhay were appointed to the
Curriculum Committee.

Evan Feldman, a former Cowles
worker, was taken off line jobs because
he was “unfairly critical of food and
over-obnoxmus," according to McCon-
nell. “I've talked to people I know and
they didn't think I was obnoxious,” said
Feldman. “The whole idea of food ser-
vice is that it s college run and with col
lege students- if the food s bad there is
going to be some talk about it "

“It‘s my job to run the best program 1
can," said McConnell ”How would you
feel it this happened at a restaurant?"
