TV sale boosts endowment

by Jody Ann Hoffman

Approximately two weeks ago the
Grinnell College trustees signed a
contract to sell the Dayton, Ohio,
television station, WDTN, which they
originally purchased in 19776 for $12.9
million.

Grinnell Communication Cor-
poration, a subsidiary or the college
managed by the trustees, agreed to sell
the station to the Hearst Corporation
for an amount “which will total almost
50 million dollars." according to
The New York Times (June 21, 1980).

Since the Hearst Corporation
released this information. Fortune,
Pensions and Investments, The Des
Moincs Register. The San Francisco
Chronicle. the Wall Street Journal, and
The New York Times have released
articles on the sale. College President
George Drake leels that a conservative
estimate ot' profits from the sale will be
$35 million as originally estimated by
The New York Times, When asked
about the finality of the sale, Drake
pointed out that it was final after
Federal Communication Commission
approval. “Meantime, we are the
owners of the station,” he said.
However. Drake expects finalization
sometime between January and April
198i.

Grinnell College Trustees had plans
to hold the station ior 25 years, but
accepted the Hearst Corporation olier

lur two reasons, according to Dralke
The first reason was that WDTN made
up about one half of the real value of
Grinnell's endowment resulting in ii
portfolio dependent on one large invest
ment. The second was a feeling that the
large growth period may be over for
television stations.

The money made from the sale of
WDTN will largely be added rein
vestment to the endowment. When the
sale of WDTN becomes final, Grinnell’s
endowment will be Over $70 million,
according to Drake and, he added,
“That will place us in the top l0 to 20
very best endowed small colleges."

When talking about investment
money Drake said the new goal for the
endowment would be $100 million As of
yet the amount and place of investment
is unknown, although Drake disclosed
that trustees Buffet, Hutchison, and
Rosentield had some ideas for rein-

'vestment and that any reinvestment

would be discussed by the iinance
committee after the FCC approves the
sale. Money not reinvested from the
sale will probably help the renovation
projects, as the money ior these was
tight early this spring, Drake
speciﬁcally mentioned the renovation
of Hurling Library as a beneractor of
the sale,

ClaSS enrollment, Drake replied that
redistribution of proiessors as
retirements take place should clear up
any problems. Drake also mentioned
the money as an insurance of stability
should declining enrollment affect
Grinnell, In particular, he hopes a
larger endowment will cushion
