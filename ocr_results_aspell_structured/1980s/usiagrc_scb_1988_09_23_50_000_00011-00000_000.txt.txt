Pioneers earn first victory

by George Melimsey

The Pioneer Women's
Volleyball Team continued to
pursue that elusive first win last
week at home and at the Knox
Invitational over the weekend.
Their efforts were rcwarded.
Coming off some tough losses to
Wartburg, Knox, and Aurora
University, the team pulled
together and blasted Carl
Sandbcrg Junior College 15-6,
1575. The win proved that the
consistenl improvement this
learn has made, a phrase which to
a winless team reads like
“helpful" from a prof who has
just ripped your paper to shreds,
would be met with a just reward.
This team has won though, and
the road ahead is looking
brighter.

Unfortunately, the women
were not able to put together a
consistent attack in time to over»
come the strengths of Wartburg
on Thursday. "[Wartburg] started
out well and just got on a roll we
couldn’t stop," Coach Sheila
Cain said. The visitors also
found the Achilles heel of the
Pioneers, defense against the
dink, early on and managed to
exploit it for most of the match.
"We've spent a lot of time in
practice working on that since
Thursday, Cain says.

Over the weekend, the women
travelled to Knox for the invita-
tional. They fell in the
conference match with the host
team 15-8, 1575, and 15-4 and
had trouble with Aurora
University, losing 1577, 15-6.
Carl Sanbcrg J.C. however was
a different story all together as
the Pioneers steamrolled to their
first win. Cain was especially
impressed with the play of her
bcneh throughout the weekend.
"We played a lot of people and
those that came off the bench
really gave us a boost," she said.

The Pioneers will take more
experience and all the confidence
that the first win gives to a team
onto the floor of thc PEC on
Friday evening at 7:00, They thI
then host the 'Grinnell
Invitational all day Saturday.

The early bird
gets the worm

by Bob Lifton

It was a tough weekend for
the women's Soccer team. On
Saturday they suffered a 4-0 defeat
at the hands of St, Norbert. Not
a very auspicious way to open
conference play. When things go
good, they really go good; but
when they go bad, ooh, they sure
do hurt. I think that about
epitomizes the Pioneers weekend,
except for that part about "good
things." There weren't any.

After Saturday's debacle, the
Pioneer's encountered some more
bad fate. They arrived in
Lawrence an hour late for the
game and were forced to forfeit
(someone wouldn't bend the
rules, even the referees right in
town: probably because it was
such an integral NCAA
tnatchup). Not being cvcn
allowed the opportunity to play
is worse than gctting shutout.

What's even more dcpressing,
Lawrence is not only in the
Pioneer's conference, but is most
likely a team which Grinncll
would have beaten. I hate it
when that happens.

At least there's no chance for
them to be late for their next
game (unless of course they party
much too hard tonight and just

can't make that afternoon match) ‘

as it's right here in Grinncll. The
Pioneers will actually play in
this game against conference
opponent Lake Forest. The
Foresters from the North Shore
will undoubtedly provide a
formidable challengc, having
already beaten division into Nolre
Dame this fall. Hopefully the Or
4 Pioneers can earn their frisl
victory. At least they'll get to
try.

 

   

"Purple Roos" & co.
host Les Duke

by David M Hammond and Jeff
Nassil'f

The men's cross team has a
new philosophy which it hopes
will enable them to have a suc-
cessful season. First, Coach
Will Freeman has lined up the
toughest schedule that the team
has ever faced in order to
acclimate the Purple R005 to
running with tougher
competition. Second, while the
team will race each week,
individuals will generally race
only every other week. This will
allow runners to train extremely
hard during off weeks, better
preparing them for the end of the
season. Third, this will prevent
the runners from overracing.
Freeman believes that running
too many races during the season
contributed to the team's flat porn
formancc at last year's regional
meet. The ultimate goal of this
year's squad is to run a strong
race in the regional meet and
place in the top three teams, thus
qualifying for the Division 111
National Championship Mcct to
be held at Washington University
in SLLouis. The team placed
seventh in last year‘s regional
meet.

The Purple Roos have their
best shot in decades at qualifying
for Nationals. For one thing, the
team has won two consecutive
conference championships and
lost only one senior from the
varsity unit, which was
nationally ranked for most of last
season. As well, Freeman has
brought in another large crop of
talented freshmen. Those two
factors result in a fortyathree
member team, the largest
collection of Purple Roos ever
assembled at Grinncll College.

Tomorrow, Grinnell College
hosts the LC: Duke Invitational,

 

the Roos‘ only home meet this
year, The meet will be held on
the golf course north of campus.
At 10 3.171., there will be a five
kilometer alumni race, followed

by the womens five kilometer
race at 11 am. and the mens

ﬁve milcr at 11:45 am. Coach
Freeman has assembled the
meet's strongest field ever.
Augustana, ranked eleventh in the
nation in Division Ill, and
Luther, ranked foumenlh, will be
favored but will be pushed to Lhe
wire by Grinncll's valiant Roos.
Carleton and Warlburg, both
deﬁnite contenders, are the best of
the remaining thirteen teams in
the ﬁeld. Grinnell lost to then-
nalionally-ranked Simpson by a
scant three points in last year's
meet. Any fan support would be
very useful to the high-hoppin'
Purple Roos as they attempt to
avenge last year's defeat and win
the Les Duke Invitational.
