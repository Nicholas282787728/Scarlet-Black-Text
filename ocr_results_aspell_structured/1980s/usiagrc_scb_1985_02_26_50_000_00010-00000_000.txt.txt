A case against investment

Grinnell is in the throes of an important
decision about its holdings in companies
which do business with South Africa. In
order to make uiis decision wisely, it is
necessary that all sides of the question he
examined. Hence this column will be
devoted to the case against full. immediate
divestment.

1 Divestment seeks to end all ioreign in-
volvement in South Africa‘s economy, first
by making it unprofitable tor firms to do
business with and in South Africa and. see
'cond. by bringing about economic sanc-

tions-designed to eliminate all trade with .

South Africa. The result. it is believed, will
be wide-spread social unrest which will
topple South Alrica’s political/economic
system in favor of a non-racist, non-
capitalist one. Evidence suggests,
however. that this hope is not well-
founded.

The sheer economic effect of
“besbcase” divestment will not bring
Soilth Africa to its knees. South Africa's
1981 GNP was $81,!) billion dollars, Trade
with the U.S. (by far South Africa’s largest
trading partneri was 55.3 billion. roughly
7% or South Airica's GNP. To suggest that
a removal of this capital would topple
South Africa is naive, It should be borne in
mind that. although money would leave
South Africa. things like factories are
harder to come and would surely' be ”con-
iiscated" by the South African govern-
ment, which would tolerate harsher work-
ing conditions than are currently in effect,
Nor would the full amount above leave
South Africa. for the government could
freeze, or “appropriate” assets and Min
fiscate merchandise; all ot which 24991995
sold or otherwise utilized by the govern
ment. .

Nor would the hopedlor embargo occur.
Western nations respecting such an em~
bargo would be in a position similar to
O.P.E.C.'s - each would rely only on the
good, faith of the other to prevent being
overtaken in the international market by a
m.u_tinous participant. The current
degeneration of O.P.E.C. fairly indicates
the eventual betrayal from within of a
Saudi African embargo. especially when
one contemplates South Africa’s richness
in,the rare raw materials so desperately
needed by the West's industrial nations,

Even were a “Freedom Embargo"
observed for any length or time internally.
it would be rapidly destroyed from
without. The grain embargo against the
Soviets provides an example: Australian.
New Zealand, and Canadian suppliers
were more than happy to take advantage
of. the “seller's market" created by the
U25 ‘ absence. Further, it would be wise to
remember that. when the Carter Ad-
mi 'stration imposed a zinc embargo on
racist Rhod sia the Sov' t Union pur

savings. Such a threat to the “Freedom
Embargo” would precipitate a mad rush
by the West to recoup what it had lost - at
an immense profit for South Africa.

Thus it is unlikely that full divestment
will bring about the demise of South
Africa. It would. however. create immense
hardships for South Africa's blacks. Such
considerations are not lost on the black
population, who indicated in a recent poll
that 75% of them opposed divestment and
did not desire a radical break with the ex-
tant capitalisteconomic system - a system
which induces thousands of blacks to imr
migrate illegally into South Africa, and
which offers one of the highest standards
of living for blacks in Africa. These objec-
tions were summed up by the leader of the
Zulu nation. who recently told Sen. Ken-
nedy that divestment was “madness"
which could only bring great hardships,

With regards to this last point. we should
realize that since 1980, according to the ln-
vestor Responsibility Research Center. a
net total of 19 US. companies have
divested from South Africa. This list in-
cludes giants such as Chrysler and
Bethlehem Steel. Yet apartheid is as
strong today as it was then. and the unrest
seen there ha been met with vicious
government violence. Can we realistically
expect the South African estabalishment.
which commands the best army in Africa
and which, it seems. possesses crude
nuclear weapons. to acquiesce to such
overt pressure without immense bloodsh-
ed? Opponents of immediate divestment
are often labelled “callous" for “condem-
ing” south Africa‘s blacks to the misery of
apartheid. Can condeming millions » of all
racers - to at least equal misery as the
result of a civil war {the outcome of which
can be called doubtful at best) escape the
same criticism?

The hope for such unrest is particularly
tragic when held up against die im-
provements resulting from South Africa‘s
desire for economic gains. As the economy
expands, the demand for labor of all kinds
increases. White labor becomes increas-
ingly expensive while black labor becomes
correspondingly attractive. Thus pressure

the economy by making them the
mainstay of an incresasing worktorce, >

This development can be seen in the
open flouting of the ractallyvmotlvated’
laws restricting certain occupations to‘
whites by white employers, and in the re
cent initiative from the white “captains of;
industry”. Last month a consortium
representing 30% of South Africa’s in-l
dustry and commerce sharply rebuked the
apartheid Botha government and called'
for an end to all South Africa's raClallyr.
discriminatory laws. The group also con
demned forced resettlement of blacks, and i
called [or limits on police authority and an
increased rule for labor unions. Though the ‘
group did not take the next step tit stopped .
short of calling for oneeman, one-vote
democracy), it nonetheless demonstrated b
the immense antirapartheid pressure
economic expansion can exert. '

This group oi rich white South Africans
is not motivated out of a concern forI
human rights: it operates from the profit,
motive. They recognize that maximum
profit can only be gained by increasing the ~
efficiency of the work-force and removing
the possibility of civil strife But these'
goals cannot be realized without improve ‘
ing. however reluctantly, the living and
working conditions of blacks. The result is y
social mobility and a liberalizing trend
which. if continued. will lead to political '
reforms as well,

The role which American corporations
play in this pressure for reform is cons
siderable. By their adherence to
agreements like the Sullivan Accords
these companies have contributed over
$100 million to programs specificallv»
designed to aid their non»white employees.
and they give the lie to any contention that
companies which hire blacks equally with
whites and refuse to segregate their
workplaces cannot be profitable. Thus it
is not unreasonable to assume that this ex-
ample plays a major role in lending
credibility to plans for reform.

In conclusion, it should not be said that
full divestment has had no role in bringing
about pressure for reform, 0n the con
trary. the threat oi divestment provides a
continual reminder to South Africa that
unpleasant, if not unbearable, conse-
quences will flow from a continued
adherence to apartheid. (Indeed a limited,
selective use of divestment along the lines
of ﬁle Sullivan Accords could be a useful
tool in improving the influence of U.S.
companies in South Africal. But full
divestment is useful only as a threat, Full
divestment would produce minimal results
while removing any lever we have for real
change in South Atrica. The threat of
divestment should therefore remain only a
"stick" to combine with the far more air
fective “carrot” of economic gain ’n order
