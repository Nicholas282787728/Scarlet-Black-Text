The Grinnell men’s rugby team lost 22-12
last Saturday. One player told me that
meant they only lost by about two “tries”
and an extra point. lwouldn't know; I'm a
rugbus terminologus ignoramus. it's just
fun to watch...

In football, the Grinnell Pioneers
defeated Carleton, 76, last Saturday if you
eliminate the firsthalf, which is justwhat I
did. Arriving at Rnsenbloom Field right
after halftime, I witnessed some decent
Pioneer football. QB Joey Walsh and RE
Pat O‘Reilly looked especially good, and
Grinnell should have scored again at the
end. Unfortunately. the Carls scored 26
points in the second quarter to win 32-7“,
.Biggest disappointment of the game was
the absence of the kazoo hand at halftime.
Coach Dombrowski understandably didn‘t
want them to go marching around on the
wet field. Have no fear, though, kazoo
fans. According to cry-organizer Evan
Feldman, it they don’t get a chance at
football games, they’ll wait until spring

The Grinnell College soccer team opens

defense of its Midwest Conference
Southern Division crown with games at
Monmouth and Cornell.

Coach John Pfitsch’s Pioneers meet
Monmouth at Monmouth, lll., tomorrow
and then go to Mt. Vernon for a Thursday
encounter with Cornell.

Grinnell captured the Southern Division
title with a perfect 4-0 record last year, but
bowed to Northern Division winner Lake
Forest 24), in a playoff.

The Pioneers experienced a “peak and
valley" weekend during a swing through
Illinois. Peak time was a 2-1 double
overtime loss to Sangamon State, a
nationally-ranked NAIA power. “We
played with a lot of emotion and intensity,
and turned in an outstanding defensive
performance,“ Pfitsch said. The leaders
were fullbacks Dave Furth, Jim Roun-
sevell and goalie Greg Donovan. Forward
Eric Pedicini notched the Grinnell goal in
the second halfi '

and perform during the seventh inning
stretch of baseball games... .

Freshman Kathy Cullen is the “Charlie
Hustle" of Grinnell field hockey. Her
constant dives and lunges after the ball
leave her on the ground for about half the
game, Cullen’s hustle is a pleasure to
watch as is the whole team. But one thing
I’ve never understood about field hockey is
how the team can be so cheery after a loss,
Alter each game, the teams get together in
a big chummy circle and yen “Yeahrahv
hockey, thank you otficials,-good game
UNli” Whenever I lose, I want to yell
Something like “Don’t blame me, [$1.781
the refs. go back to Cedar Falls.” I guess
nice guys finish last...

The nationwide obsession with elec
tronic games such as Asteroids and Pac-
Man has hit women’s tennis coach John
Harvey, whose earlyrsession passion was
”playing Space invaders with the
automatic ball machines." His goal, he
says, is “to perfect mechanized coaching
by having the ball machines play each
other."....

The word from The Hoss is that we’ve
got some “big boys” coming out for hoop
this winter. Let’s hope so, since Walsh.
Pabst, Samore, and Bedard won't be
back....

Major league baseball, with its recent
proliferation of strikes and brawls, is
really a funny game. Take the Yankees

by the player vs. fan scuffles involving
Reggie Smith in San Francisco and Pete
Rose in St. louis. Coming on the heels of

”We’re playing better as we gain ex-
perience,” Volleyball Coach Martha
Rowedder said after her youthful Pioneers
dropped a pair of matches during a trip to
Illinois last weekend.

Knox bested the Pioneers l572, 154 and
15-11, and Monmouth claimed a 154, 15-4
and 15-2 victory. “We battled from behind
to gain an 11-11 tie in the third game
against Knox,” Rowedder noted.

Also last week, Grinnell lost 1579. 156, 15-
4 to Cornell. “We displayed great team
hustle and movement,” the coach said.

half and gained a 44 draw. Halfback Reid

Cesar Cedeno’s fracas the week before,
don't be surprised it Rodney Dangerfield’s
new line is “I went to a fight the other night
and a baseball game broke out." Well, at
least the media’s focus is back in the
stadium, where it belongs, rather than on
the negotiating table...
