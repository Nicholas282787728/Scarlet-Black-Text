North Campus: who needs it9

So, there’s been a drop in enrollment and the ad-
ministration has to cut corners. Okay, we can deal with
that, even though they make some decisions that we think
suck. But we would like to propose a cut that, while it may
prove somewhat unpopular at first, is certain to gain
favor with many,

Basically, North Campus has to go. All of it. Now.

Let’s take a quick look at the festering landmass north
of 8th Avenue. First of all, there’s Norris. Say no more,
leave it quickly, Nobody likes Norris, and nobody should
be forced to have anything to do with it.

Then we’ve got single-sex dorms, They’re okay for ner-
vous parents and North Shore transplants, but this is Grin-
nell, folks. Let‘s grow up and live together, alright?7

Younker Hall? We can do better, It is fairly innocuous,
but the place always smells and it looks like ARH, not to
mention having the Auschwitz showers.

Unofficial studies have shown that North Campus life
retards emotional and intellectual growth. The general
rule “over yonder" is that it takes two semesters to
become a sophomore, but at least three to stop behaving
like a Freshman

We have to admit that North Campus has its good
points. The Health Center has been known to provide a
useful service upon occasiOn, the PEG is a nice place to go
after sitting for hours in the library and the automatic
tray busser in Cowles is quite the contraption. These items
could be salvaged at some cost, but it just might be worth
it to save ulese items for the rest of us,

Removing the rest of North Campus could pose a pro—
blem, but we would like to offer a few modest proposals.
One possible answer is to run a geological fault along 8th
Avenue and simply drift the whole kit and kaboodle into
southern Canada. Another idea is to have a fundraising
auction and sell the mess at a profit.

Or we could invite the nearest Army reserve unit to
practice mortar fire on it. (The latter proposal might
create a few fallout problems and raise the dander of a
few military-conscious South Campus folks, but the im-
portant thing is the ends, not the means.)

The problem is not getting any better and time is of the
essence. North Campus has to be removed as soon as
possible. We at the Black and Blue call upon the ad»
ministration to take swift action on this urgent matter.

It has come to my attention that
Grinnell College is putting a great
deal of time and effort into the
publicizing or my lather. Morgan
Taylor, '26. I would like to warn
you and the rest of the College that
you may be making a big mistake.

First of all, my dad did not like
Grinnell, l-le hated his years at
that school and says so in his un»
completed book, “Morgan
Taylor: A Man who Really Hates
Grinnell College.

Dad died before the book was
finished. but he often told me how
much fun he was going to have
writing about the ugly women.
Yankee lovers and the high tuition
at Grinnell. Dad used to tell me
how his Iriends would have in»
vented the "panty raid" but they
knew it wouldn't be any fun.

Secondly, Dad was recruited to
prop up a sagging athletic depart-
ment and was not up to par
academically. To stay eligible to
compete. he would take easy
courses deSlgned just for him and
cheat on papers and exams. Not
many people know this, but my
father’s career at Grinnell was
made possible by a man llamcd lrr
ving “Pinky” Dinklusser. who
wrote most of Dad's papers and

 

 

 

 

provided him with crib notes for
tests,

are blown way out oi proportion.
Sure. he was a pretty good athlete
in his day. but look at the chumps
he was competing against
Remember, we're talking
Midwest Collegiate Athletic Coils
ference here,

Further, and this may be the
most shocking bit oi all, my father
pioneered the use of artificial
methods of enhancing athletic
performance. That is. the man
took drugs. Dad used to tell me
how proud the boys in the Biology
department were when the
anabolic Steriods they made for
him worked so well. Of course.
they couldn’t tell anybody or they
would all get incredibly busted.
And that gold medal performance
in the Olympics? Forget it. Dad
told me he was so hopped up on

Don’t
do this

To The Editor,

Last year. we wrote a letter ex-
plaining to the campus communi-
ty how we cut a laundry chip in
half and tried to use the half
tokens in the washers and dryers
on campus. We were sad to report
that the experiment didn't work.
This year, we tried something
new.

The other day, we went up to the

PEG to play basketball. There
were three of us and only two
basketballs, and each or us
wanted to shoot some hoops. So
what we did was, we cut one of the
basketballs in half so that we
could all shoot baskets. The only
problem was that the ball we cut
in hall didn’t bounce so well and
was hard to shoot, too.

Take our advice; don’t cut a
basketball in hali. it doesn't work.

To the Editor.

Regarding your editorial of
April 20: I beg to differ, Let's face

it. the town of Grinnell sucks. In
fact, besides Cleveland, I cannot

imagine a worse place to go to
school,

The town simply lacks modern
conveniences like McDonald’s.
necessities like Macy‘s and
character (where's the garbage?)
Can you believe we trade these
things for “quaint"
midwestern streets? I tried to get
in to the Norman Rockwell Scene
once and went for a walk 7 I got
lost. How can you help it when all
these boring white houses are
identical?

The 5&3 editor, along with his
brown-nosing staff. have been
licking this town's boots far too
long. It’s high time for the
students here to initiate direct ac
tion (for all you country mice that
means violence) to remedy this
situation. Do you realize that if we
didn‘t go home for the summer.
we would never see the new

little.

Rules:
a great
idea

it should be obvious by now to
all the ranting, pseudorliberal
pansies, at this school that we
simply do not have an effective
code of conduct here, and I say we
should do Something about it.

My proposal starts by borrow-
ing a chapter from Okalahoma
Christian College’s book. Among
their many line rules are things
like curiews and a sex-segregated
campus. it is my opinion that the
hellions here at Grinnell College
would benefit from a healthy dose
of rules like these.

Ireter my readers to the follow
ing article, which is reprinted in
its entirety. the article is taken
from the April 11, 1984 issue of the
OCC Talon, Read it and be
enlightened.

The Adminislralll/e Conner! has
recommended and J Tony Johnson,
President, has applowtl the uktcnswn
of curfew in the singlo student apart

The proposal was lnadt‘ lo the ori-

A second proposal by the Student
Senate was not recommended by the
Adlllillistmllue Council. that students
should be allowed to go ll7 lhe door of

While recognizing that it does create
some tnL‘U’Ll/Elllentl‘ [or students to

L‘ll felt that allowing men to enter the
women's apartment area would create
more problems than it would solve.

They pro/in [a leave the area off»
limlts to men to protect the privacy o/
the women who Iii/c in the area. This
policy also means that any man in the
arm is conspicuous and persons who

he more costly recognized,

Surely there is something ior
all of us to learn from this article.
Rules are what made America
great. and i say Grinnell College
gets a few rules like these for
itself,

It's your llfe. friend. Put it ill
order.

Woody Allen movie?

And another thing, have you
tried to buy cocaine recently?
Don't bother. My favorite dealer
(who happens to be the biggest
stick in Hobokin) has never heard
of Iowa and says he'd feed his
“stuff" to his dog beiore shipping
it to the cornfields.

Couldn't the Chamber of Com-
merce stop sending us maps of
this place and cultivate some coil- »
nections? Just talk to me and I'll
give you Guido‘s number. _
