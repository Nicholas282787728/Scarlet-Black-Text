by Scott i-iiliiula

“Master Harold. . , and the
Boys,” the most provocative and
significant play to be seen in Grin~
nell since Lanford Wilson’s “Tal-
ly’s Folly,” will be staged today,
Friday, at 3:30 pm and a pm, in
Roberts Theater.

Athol Fugard, author oi
“Master Harold , . . and the
Boys,” tells die story oi a seven
teen yearrold boy growing up in
South Africa during the 1950‘s,
Frankly autobiographical in
nature, the story revolves around
the young white boy (Evan
Handler), who we can associate
with playwright Fugard, and his
relationship with me two black
waiters employed in his parents
tearroom (Zakes Mokae and Ray
Aranha), On a rainy aiternoon the
young ‘Hally’ arrives to eat lunch
and do his homework while the

two ‘boys' clean the room and
practice {or an upcoming
ballroom dance competition. The
two ‘boys’ have in effect raised
the young iially, and when the boy
chooses this particular aiternoon
to tell a racial joke the bonds bet
ween the boy and his ‘boys' are
shattered.

“Master Harold l . and the
Boys” has at its heart this map-
portune incident, and the results
oi the play as they unfold revolve
around the shock-waves that me
joke creates One critic Wrote of
the crucial scene when Hally tells
the joke, . . within seconds the
tea room has been destroyed: not
by a bomb, or stones thrown
through the window, or any of the
more usual signs oi racial unrest
but from within, by the boy’s Sud'
den determination to go irom Hair

ly to Master l-larold, irom friend
and pupil to boss and bully: sud
denly we've no longer got two
waiters dancing in the rain but
two black adults and their teenage
white oppressor. . ”

“Master Harold. . . and the
Boys" was nominated for three
Tony Awards in 1982 but lost that
of Best Play and Best Direction to
the Royal Shakespeare
Company's production of
“Nicholas Nickelby," although
South African Zakes Mokae, who
originated the role of Sam on
Broadway, won the Tony as Best
Supporting Actor

curial," to cite but one of the
many adjectives applied over the
years to Albert Collins.

This guy knows how to put on a
Showand get your ieet dancing, so
y'all come ’round and sweat like a
bunch ‘a pigs now, y'hearl
Okeydoke.

As part of Slavic Weekend, “Beds” (1981) is a vast film that attempts
to capture the spirit of the Great October Revolution, as seen through the
eyes of one Jack Reed (Warren Beattyl What “Reds" succeeds in doing
is telling the story of not only revolution-in-the-making but loverin-the
making, as the romance between Reed and Louise Bryant (Diane
Keaton) becomes the focal point of the film.

“Reds" is the tale of Reed and Bryant as they helmet) in the super-
charged intellectuai atmosphere of Greenwich Village during the early
years oi this century; oi their stormy romance; oi dieir days as
reporters during World War 1 and their subsequent reporting of the
events in Russia in 1917. The action moved swift and sure from location
to location by virtue of some crisp editing, and only rarely during the
film does it seem to bog down

Beatty’s story of love, death, radicals, and revolution draws much oi
its power from its supporting cast: Jack Nicholson as a cool Eugene
O’Neill gives a strong periormance, as does Maureen Stapleton in the
role of radical Emma Goldman, for which she won a Oscar as Best sup
porting Actress, Beatty's 'Witnesses' are wonderiul; their first-hand ac
counts are valuable insights to the characters of Reed and Bryant and to
the events leading up to and surrounding the Revolution of 1917,

Beatty won Best Director for “Reds.” and cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro won Best Cinematography. This iilm is deiinitely worth seeing;
its scope and ambition are rarely found in such abundance “Reds" Wlll
show Friday, Feb. 17 at 9:30 in ARH and Sunday, Feb. 19 at7 in ARH, 200

min. Gandhi

Perhaps only Richard Attenborough’s “Gandhi" attains the same
scope and ambition as does “Reds,” and in fact may even surpass
“Reds" in these categories. “Gandhi" is truly a monumental piece of
work, with Oscarrecipient Ben Kingsley in the role of the mahatma, and
is so sweeping and panoramic in its scope diat one critic was moved to
write, ”I ielt exhausted, enlightened, and most of all exhiliarated..
‘Gandhi’ pushed me to heights 1 had once imagined were reserved solely
tor the sublime..." See this iilm, enjoy, and be exhiliarated, (For a com»
plete review see 2/10/34 edition oi The Son). “Gandhi" will show Satur-
day, Feb. 13 at 7 pm in ARH,187 min.

The Candidate

Also out of Hollywood but not in the epic tradition of “Reds” or "Gan-
dhi” is the earlier ([972) political film ”The Candidate." directed by
Michael Ritchie and staring Robert Redford as an idealistic California
lawyer who is persuaded to run for the Senate, Bill McKay (Redford) is
for clean air, clean beaches, clean water and clean politics, or at lest he
is until the imagermakers take over his campaign and push him further
away from his ideals to a more ‘middle-of—theroad,’ politically ‘safe'
position

Throughout the course of the film we see Redford gradually become
something resembling ‘silly putty' in the hands oi the men who are runn-
ing his campaign, men who are seasoned pros (Peter Boyle as Lucas,
one of the more seasoned) in the arena of political fabrication, this is.
creating the candidate into a saleable item, packaged, preened, and
ready to go, Plain talk turns into deception, facts into distortions. That
this film was made in 1972, a rather memorable election year, makes for
ironic commentary on the state oi candidates and campaigns. “The Can-
didate“ will be shown Saturday, Feb 18 at 10:15 in ARI-l and on Sunday,
Feb, 19 immediately following “Reds" (around 9:30) in ARH. 109 min.

Gallipoli

While “Gandhi” and ”Reds" are big, sweeping successes in their own
ways, Peter Weir’s “Gallipoli” (1981) is just as big a success in its own
more subdued, less strident manner. “Gallipoli” is typical of the flock of
excellent films that have come from Australia in the past several years,
and shares with them (“Breaker Morant," “My Brilliant Career," “The
Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith,” etc ) three venerable characteristics; a
simple, concise story line, poweriul acting, and tlawless direction,
“Gallipoll” is just that; simple, concise, and very poweriul

“Gallipoli,” part oi the ongoing international Director‘s Series, is the
story oi two Australian boys, Archy and Frank (Mark Lee and Mel Gibr
son) who leave the rural stretches of dusty Australia when they enlist in
a light cavalry brigade during World War 1. They are ultimately sent to
Gallipoli to help wage an illiated campaign against the Turks, and in the
course of their travels and their exploits we see their relationship take
form The tragic consequences of the British actions, and the results
those actions had on the Aussie soliders who were little more than pawns
in a deadly game oi trench warfare against the Turks, iorm the core oi
“Gallipoll.”

Archy is a romantic, eager patriot: Frank is a realist who joins the
ranks only when he’s taunted for cowardice by his mates. However they
come together, Lee and Gibson are perfect; the acting is subdued by
very strong. Director Weir is right on cue, and the crisp, pristine quailty
of “Gallipoli" is final testimony to Weir's expertise, Do not miss this
iilm,

“Gallipoli” will be shown Wednesday, Feb. 22 at 9 p m. iil ARH and
Thursday, Feb. 23 at 9:30 in SL,

Remember!

“Sibirlada,” the epic tale oi two iamilies over so yers in Russia. will be
shown Sunday, Feb, 19 at 9 pm. in SL (part 11 only), and the iilm can be
seen in its entirety Monday, Feb 20 at 7 pm. in ARH,
