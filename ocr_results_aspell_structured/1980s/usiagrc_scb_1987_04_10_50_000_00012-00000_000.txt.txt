it: the people at Carleton are already go.
ing to college while the kids at Edina High
are now looking for a college. Ah, blatant
commercialism. We were walking, talk-
ing, singing pamphles tor the GE. “After
the show, we’ll be handing out applications
in the cafeteria. No need to push and
shove, iolks, there are plenty at Viewbooks
to go around. Step outside and be inter
viewed in the minibus by Pepper, our
driver.” That’s what we should have call-
ed it: the Mearsmobile.

And so we spent hali our time in chur»
ches and half our time in high schools,
singing the greatest hits or the 16th century
— slow, plodding music, harmonious,
although generally uninspiring. This much
was absolutely predictable, when, during
the concert, we launched into the DiLasso
mass, the priest in the audience ~
wherever he was sitting e would lean into
a jaw~breaking yawn. It neverfailed.

it was generally at the high schools,
though, that Iconsidered mutiny. We could
stage a coup and ﬂing our music to the
wind, We could commandeer that minibus,
yelling to Pepper, our driver, “Pepper, are
you with us?" And he would yell, “Hell,
yes, kids!” We would point that giant
chunk oi rolling plastic to the west and
Wouldn't stop until we hit the California
coast.

We sat down in the auditorium of
Highland Park High School, and the prtnr
cipal on the stage said, “First of all, I’d
like to welcome the Grinnell Singers." Just
then, I noticed a message carved in the
back of the chair in front of me, It said,
“Die, cocksucker.” I wasn’t sure which
was the more Sincere. While we ate lunch
with the school’s chorus a few minutes
later, an ambulance pulled up outside. A
student told us lmost reassuringly, "Oh,
yeah, people ai dying here all the time.”
Time to leave.

We did leave and. ln fact, had the rest of
the day off, Free time on tour pitchers at

Trivial Pursuit, a trip to the Minnesota Zoo
where Donny Cotter got spit on twice by a
llama, green beer in St. Cloud, malls and
McDonaldsland the Walker Art Center, a
production oi the gospel-opera “Gospel at
Colonus" which made Singers' pieces like
“0 Mirtillo‘ look pretty bad, Vietnamese
restaurants, bus charades, the movie
”Hair," chili with black olives floating in
it, Chinese take-out lunches and giant piz-
za pies wolfed down in seconds ﬂat.

Our final night on tour, we took the
elevators to a catering hall atop Dayton's
department store — they turned off the
Muzak especially for us — and sang to a
small contingent oi“ alumni (who strained
to hear Jake Heringman's lute solo above
the din Coming from the kitchen next
door). After this catered extravaganza we
were whisked away by the holy rolling
plastic Mearsmobile and plopped back at
our hotel, the Hopkins House, where an en-
tire icy bathtub full oi beer awaited us in
room 612. We spent that night (almost)
polishing it on as we got luther and iurther
air-key singing to Jake’s guitar. Shane
Cook, the college’s director oi alumni pro-
grams, dropped by, as did our pianist Barb
Lien, who helped Rick build beer-can
pyramids. Three-beer harmonies shook
the Sixth floor.

That night, as we ilipped the TV Chan»
nels between Mr. Rogers, “Conan the Bar
barian” and a Prestdentlal news cons
terence, the three programs began to
blend together ln my mind and I saw Presi-
dent Reagan lacing up his tennis shoes and
doing battle with newspaper reporters in
the Land at MakerBelieve. And as the night
were on. the whole trip began to blend
together in my mind as a hunch oi people
wearing “Hellomy-hameds“ tags,
wandering around at a church pot-luck
dinner and asking me. “Whatever brought
you out to college in loua from that
stinkhole back East?" And I would
answer. lying. "The iniiiibus out there
did."
