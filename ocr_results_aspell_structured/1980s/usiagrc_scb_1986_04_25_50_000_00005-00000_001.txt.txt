Frlz'lr It' I claims no
retention problem

by .I.L.S. Trystero

Dozens of Grinnell professors tied the
campus this week. lured to new high
paying jobs at prestigious colleges and
universities around the world

One ex-prot, who requested complete
anonymity as well as political asylum
from the administration before she would
agree to talk to the YGSB, said she was
looking forward to a job with a salary that
would allow her to “enjoy the little lux-
uries of life . . . heat. Box springs. Fresh
vegetables. A car Stuff like that.”

Another former faculty member ex-
plained that itwasn‘tso much a question oi
salary as it was of location. “Who wants to
live in Podunk, Iowa? I want to live in a
town with lots of real, beautiful women.
My mother would kill me if she knew that
my latest girlfriend is a sheep."

Another ex-pror. caught sneaking on
campus in the trunk of a '72 Vega. said his
reason tor leaving was purely profes
sional: “I find the goats and cows
meandering through my office a terrible
insult to my plofesslonal integri

The stack oi letteis of resignation on
Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazer s desk
\londay morning was a good two ieet high.

Yet Frazer still contends that Grinnell
does not have a problem with faculty
retention Just last week, she explained
tllree mellequalliled applicants for posi-
tions opening in the sociology department
accepted Grinnell's job oiier.

Frazer insists that lhere is no truth to the
rumor that one oi tlle applicants used to
teach a high-school night course in typing.
and that the other two applicants are
orangutans: ”It was a course in speed-
reading, and they're chimpanzees, not
orangutans "

observant students. however. have
noticed the appearance of peculiar pits
around campus. and their suspicions were
confirmed by a BS man earlier this week:
Frazer set traps to snare protessors and
keep them at Grinnell against their will

Dean Frazer was unavailable for com-
ment on this point.

member of Lyndon LaRouehe's ultra-
conservative political organization,

Amann admitted that in the recent SGA
election he ran under a fictitious platform
to gain the votes of his fellow studentes and
that he never intended to get SGA to “cool
outs” Amann said, “it's about time we
start getting SGA into the enforcement of
this country's laws and begin weeding out
the drug mafia on Grinnell’s campus. The
drug mafia is everywhere and Grinnell,
with all of these barefoot, kneerjerk
liberals, is the perfect hiding-place for an
the misbegotten wealth of those Cubans in
Miami,

Since being elected, Amann has gone on
record stating that he believes that Dean
oi Faculty Catherine Frazer is a member
of an international drug ring that traffiks
South American cocaine through Grinnell.
Amann said. you know that new airport
they are building, well that is not for the
town but that airport is going to serve as a
drop-oti spot for Frazer's drug ring,

Anlann also states that he has definitive
documentation that Russian professor
John Mohan and Political Science pro
ressor Bot) Grey are agents of the KGB
Amaiin said "there is no question about
it... Grey ‘and Mohdn are stinking red
pinkos and they must be arrested lm~
medlately and tried tor treason " Amanll
said "it Will be my goal as sea president
to weed Out all the commie traders and
drug pushers.”

Amann stresses the that fact that he will
defend down to the death the right of all
Grinnell's students to have Funnelators
Amann said. “God Damm it, it is my eon~
stitutional right to have a tunnelator and
no one will take it away from me “

sylvania was elected son president in a
landslide after a number of prominent can-
