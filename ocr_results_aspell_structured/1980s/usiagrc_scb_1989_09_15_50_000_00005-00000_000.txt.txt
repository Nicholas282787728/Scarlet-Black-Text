Don’t Blame Violence on the Victims of Terrorism

 

To the Editor:

In his Ietterlastweek David Karol
gave the impression that Israel is not
quite guilty of terrorism, which
barely corresponds to the routine
reality in the occupied territories.
Perhaps a brief account of Israeli
terrorism in the Near East deserves
our consideration before we blame
the victims solely.

Terror and violence were the pri-
mary instruments in turning the
homeland of the Palestinians into
the state of Israel. The act of Israeli
terrorism that was most successful
in creating fear and panic among the
Palestinians was the intentional
slaughter of over 200 men, women
and children of Deir Yassin by the
Irgun and the Stern Gang in April
1948. Menachem Begin, then leader
of the Irgun and later a Nobel Prize
winner (for peace, incidentally), has
written in his autobiography of the
propaganda value of the massacre at
Deir Yassin, Yitzhak Shamir, the
currentPi-imeMinisterofIsrael,was
the operation commander of LEI-II,
a terrorist organization involved in
the slaughter of nearly 100Palestini-
ans in Duwayma, Yitzhak Rabin,
defense minister, was responsible
for the expulsion of 50,000 Pales~
tiniarts from the towns of Lydda and
Ramle.

Such indiscriminate killings and
the physical expulsion of Palestini-
ans tumed them into a nation of
uprooted refugees. As a result of
terrorist violence and threats and the
psychological warfare. approxir
mately 770,000 Palestinians were
displaced in 1948. For Zionist set»
tiers in Palestine, this proved to be,
in the words of the first president of
Israel,ChaimWeizmann,“amiiacu—
lous clearing of the land."

Unfortunately, the displacement
of the Palestinians, or the “clearing
of theland."if you like, did not bring

an end to Israeli brutality and terror
ism. In 1953, Ariel Sharon, who
laterbecomctheDcfenseministerof
Israel, led a unitof XDF that attacked
the village of Qiba, killing 50 civil~
ions, Similar crimes were commit-
ted by the Israelis in Kutar Kassem
in 1956 and in Sanmuu in 1966.
Since 1947,1siael has destroyed over
350Arab villagesinsideits pre71967
borders in its tradition of “making
the desert bloom,”

In 1967,allof Palestine came under
Israeli occupation. According to
Israeli ﬁgures, between 1968 and
1983 Israeli forccs killed over 90
Palestinians in the West Bankaione,
Between 1967 and 1982, Israeli
occupying authorities demolished

There Goes the Neighborhood

 

To the Editor: >

This is the letter of a desperate
man. Things in Younker have just
gotten out of control.

It used to be all right. They knew
their place and we knew ours. We
may nothave been friendlybut things
were tolerable Both communities
functioned in the same area reasona-
bly well.

But you know when the tempera-
turerises tempers flare. Iknowpeople
will defend them but as far as I am
concerned they are showing no te-
straint at all. If this is the way they
want to behaveI say let them do it in
their own neighborhood.

I cannot walk anywhere in the
dorm without being confronted by
them. Itsecmed like not so long ago
we owned this dorm and we took
pride in it. But once they moved in
everything started going downhill.

[know what you may be drinking
and it isn’t true. I never had any

problem with them before, Back
whereI used to live it was never any
problem. I have asked some of our
dorm leaders about it and they say
that you just cannot make them lis-
ten to reason. I have tried Communir
cating with them myself, but you
know whatl think‘.7 I think all they
understand is force.
, Itell you,it’sawar...andthebugs
are winning,

DAVID KAROL

raeli violence have been children.

One of the most gruesome acts of
recent Israeli terrorism were the kill-
ings atNahalin, a Palestinian village
near Bethlehem. In the early morn»
ing hours of April 13, 1989, Israeli
forces entered the village without
any provocation, shot at 40 people,
killed five Palestinians, and injured
many. Among those injured was a
14 year-old crippled youth, whom
the Israeli forces lifted from a chair
and threw on the ground. He can no
longer move his hands and ﬁngers,
which heneedstoambulatehiswheel
chair.

Indeed, there is a long and tragic
history of Israeli and/or Zionist vio-
lence against the Palestinians, and I
do not wish to present acatalogue of
Israeli terrorism. Terrorism cannot
be defined, as is often done with
professional zeal in the pages of
Commentary and The New Repub-
lic, solely as Arab violence, A dis-
cussion of terrorism in the NearEast
that fails to refer to the state»sponr
sored Israeli violence, needless cru-
elty and military intransigence lacks
credibility.

There is also a profound need in
this country to distinguish between
Israel’s programmatic violence de-
signed to perpetuate its occupation
and the resistance of those currently
subjugated under Israeli rule. Israel
is morally and politically respon-
sible for the terrorism and violence
of its willed dispossession and exr
pulsion of the inhabitants of Pales-
tine and its continued brutality upon
civilians in the occupied territories.

Scare Tactics

To the Editor:
» I must admit that Dan Wemer’s
column about Colombia that ap-
peared in last week‘s S & B scared
me. I was scared that the CIA would
be so lax as to have formerly high
ranking members running around
talking to impressionable under-
grads. I was scared that our CIA
would be assassinating Colombians
with drug connectionsand making it
looklikeadrug hit. Ithink,howevcr,
that the thing that scared me the most
about his column was the fact that
our CIA would be involved in a
conspiracy to protect the profits of
Shell Oil, a Swedish-owned com-
pany. I cried myself to sleep.
