JB unresolved on resolutions

by M. Wolfgang Schumann

oavid Kopelman presented a resolution
against the Solomon Amendment at
Wednesday's Joint Board meeting. The
Solomon Amendment requires the
withholding of all government financial
aid to male college students who have
refused to register for the draft.
Kopelman, while not a hall president'dr an.
officer of SGA, produced the resolution
that calls for Joint Board to protestifnrr
many the government's policy of denying
federallyrfinanced student financial aid to
male students who fail to register with the
Selective Service. Since the resolution was
not on the agenda for this week’s meeting,
it was not formally considered but will be
taken up next week.

Kopelman favors registration, but he
maintained that his position to the
Solomon Amendment was not
hypocritical. _ '

No Academic

by Eric Green

Last week the Student Committee on
Publications and radio (SP&R) decided
against proposing that students who par
ticipate in Grinnell’s media should receive
academic credit. Last year’s SP&R
recommended that a credit alternative be
considered dais year in response to flaggr
ing student interest in student-run media.
Currently, the 3&3 editors, the KDIC Sta»
tion manager and the Cyclone editor
receive small salaries for their efforts.

SP‘LR Chairman James Robinson said
his committee saw no point in even propose
ing that students receive credit because
the faculty remains unreceptive to such
ideas. Robinsion believes the faculty
would reject such a proposal because there
would be no adequate means of evaluating
the students and there is no department
which the credit could be attributed to.
Student media is now truly studentrrun;
the organizations have little faculty super

registration,” he said at the beginning of
his prepared speech that had many
students laughing during the speech and
applauding at the end.

Kopelman passed out copies of his pro
posal to all the hall presidents and officers
who were present, and asked them all to
post it in each dorm to make it available
for public comment.

The resolution stated that, while draft
registration itself may be our and legal,
the Solomon Amendment was blatantly unr
constitutional because it denied “life,
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” to
nonrregistrants without “due process of
law." it also required young men to testify
against themselves in signing (or not sign-
ing) the Statement of Educational Purpose
and Compliance that is required of those
receiving federal aid, and because it
denied them the opportunity to be
represented by counsel. since were is no
trial involved in denying educational

Drake Opposes
Amendment

But College refuses to replace IOsi aid

by Ken Sermon

Grinnell College President George
Drake called the Solomon amendment the
“most important issue this year" at a
forum held Thursday, Sept. 29, to discuss
the amendment and how it affects the cola
lege. The Solomon amendment, which
went into effect last Saturday, Oct. 1, re
quires the withholding of all government
financial aid to male college students who
have refused to register for the draft,

Drake spoke before about fifty people
who came to the forum held in Main
Lounge by the Registration/DRaft/CD.
Group. Drake said he was against the
amendment because it was discriminatory
on the basis of sex, age, level of education,
and income. Drake said he sent letters to
all of the collges in Iowa a few months ago
in an effort to raise support to contest the
law. Drake characterized the response
received as a “resounding vacuum."

Drake said that when the law was
challenged as discriminatory in 3 Min-
nesota court last Spring, the College tried
to become a friend of the court, but was
unable to. The US, District Court ruled in
favor of the suit and said implementation
of the Solomon amendment must halt im-
mediately. This ruling was overturned by
the U.S. Supreme Court in a statement that
said the law would remain in effect pen~
ding review of the case. A decision is ex7
pected around the beginning of next year.

Although in disagreement wiht the law,
Drake said the college would not replace
any aid lost by students who had refused to
register. One of the reasons for this is that
the money would either have to be cut
from other programs or other student
financial aid. The trustees are also in pro-
test with the law, but are not willing to
allocate any of the college’s endowment
toward replacing the lost aid.

There is also the question of whether a
college or a university would lose some or
all of its federal funding by thwam'ng the
law and financially supporting a non
registrant for his lost aid.

But even before taking these factors into
account, Drake said that itshouldn'tbe the
college's burden to take financial responr
sibility for non-registrants. “If a person

takes a stand on a matter of conscience, he
is willing to bear the consequences of his
act. if the college steps in, then it is bear-
ing the consequence."

There are some colleges that have decid-
ed to bear the consequence and replace
lost aid. Drake pointed out that these cola
ieges are religious institutions, namely
Earlham and Goshen colleges. However,
according to an article printed in the
Chicago Tribune last Saturday, the
University of California, Stanford, and
Yale have also announced that they will
replace all or part of the lost federal aid.

Three students were on the panel with
President Drake, Pete Schumacher said
he felt that “the college is obligated to help
us. The administration could let us know
that they’re thinking about it."
Schumacher has not registered for the
draft and consequently has lost between
$1500 and $2000 in government aid.

One of the other students on the panel
who has also not registered but chose to re,
main unnamed, said that he thinks “finan-
cial aid should be determined on the basis
of need and not mural value.”

Mike Oxman, another student panelist,
registerd in order not to lose his govern
ment aid. He called his act “probably the
most reprehensible thing I've ever done."
Oxman believes that in registering, he is
giving Washington a green light to pursue
their present foreign policies.”

Russell Matteson, who co-ordinated the
panel along with Marc Lambert for the
Registration/Draft/CD. Group, stressed
in an interview after the forum was over
that his group was “not here to promote
one side of the issue." Rather, said Mats
teson, “We are here to inform.” He would
like to see more people involved in the
group, and speculated that “many people
are not going to worry about it [registra-
tion] until it comes to war."

Matteson said that he was impressed
with the number of surveys that were
returned last week in response to a student
mail-box poll by his group. Four hundred
and seventy-three students responded to
the survey. The results and some of the ac»
companying comments are listed in a box

vison and are autonomous from the
academic departments. Before the Com
munications Department was abolished
ten years ago, it was possible to earn
credit because the media had a direct link
with a legitimate department of the Cole
lege.

Robinson regretted that his committee
could not make progress for students
wishing to receive credit instead of their
salaries. “It would be nice if media persons
nel could get Credit for their work." He
believes, however, that the rewards of
media work should provide adequate in-
centive in the absence of credit.

SP&R would like to encourage students
to integrate their academic work into the
media. For example, students could
publish “plus 2" work of general interest=I
in the 5&3, Grinnell could award credit in
this type of arrangement because the stun
dent would be working under the direct
guidance of a professor.

\

William Deminoff, the 5&3 faculty ad-
visor, is also disappointed that credit can
not be granted to students working in the
media. In the case of the 5&3, he mains
talns, “We should consider that good
writing is valuable to society and consider
giving credit to students who attempt good
writing,”

Although Deminoff was not optimistic
about the institution of Credit for media
work, he stressed that active efforts are
underway to improve the quality of the
5&3, most notably a series of journalism
workshops given this semester by Marilyn
Musser. He also pointed out that students
can receive credit for internships with none
college media such as the Des Moines
Register, Deminoff emphasized that train
ing through non-credit workshops given by
professionals is the best means to improve
the media and spark student interest and
incentive.

Many feel that the quality of the 8&1!

would improve it a course (for credit) was
offered in journalism. The offering of such
a course also seems unlikely. According to
Dean Catherine Frazer, the Communica-
tions Department was disbanded partly
because it did not fit into the scheme of a
liberal arts college. With this in mind, she
noted that any new courses would have to
be examined and deemed “appropriate to
the liberal arts mission," Decisions of this
kind would be, by and large, in the hands of
the faculty,

Dan Klatz, who also serves on SP&R,
does not believe in the desirability of giv-
ing credit to students involved in the
media. He believes the demarcation bet-
ween academic work and extracurricular
activities should be maintained. “You
could get absurd about giving credit for
outside activities," he said. “How could
you decide which activities deserve

credit?"
