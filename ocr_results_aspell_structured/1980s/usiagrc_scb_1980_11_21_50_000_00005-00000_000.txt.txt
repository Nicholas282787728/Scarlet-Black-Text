FOG hosts conference

by MGrCt Mann

Last weekend the Region VI cone
ference of the National Association of
College and University Food Services
(NACUFS) met here to discuss ways of
impruving food services. Region VI in-
cludes schools from Iowa, Kansas,
Missouri, and Nebraska.

Dave McConnell. director of Food of
Grinnell (FOG). describes NACUFS as
“an association dedicated to the educa»
tion and advancement oi Food Service
on campuses.” McConnell feels the an-
nual meetings are “an excellent way
{or people in business to get together
and discuss problems"

The first seminar during the con-
ference was a “meet the region" ses-
sion, during which directors of other
campus (00d services toured the Grinr
nell dining halls and tasted the food.
Most were impressed with the large
salad bar. the extent of the menu and
me sprouts but criticized the lack of
modern equipment in the kitchens.

Representatives from Amana
Refrigeration and Hobart Corporation
led an informative seminar in energy

conservation. Their ideas included
lowering the temperature oi hot water
on campus (except in the kitchen and in
some science labs), avoiding
simultaneous use at kitchen appliances
and air conditioning on campus, and in-
stalling microwave ovens to keep tood
wan-n during the end of meals when all
applicances as well as steam tables
must be lelt nn tar very lew students,

Other sessions included a speech by
the editor of institutions magazine who
stressed that ”the student is the con-
sumer.” A seminar on purchasing dur-
ing which ideas on purchasing produce
at lower prices by having it shipped at
different times, such as late at night or
early in the morning, were discussed.

All meals during the conference were
provided by brokerage houses so that
new products could be evaluated. Mc-
Connell will select a group at students
this February to evaluate foods in-
troduced at the conference. The group
will decide which new foods should be
added to the menu.
