Nov. N. 1986

by Mary Lea Crawley

Faster than any half-miler in the state of
lllin‘ois, George Drake refused alluring en-
treaties by Big Ten schools to come to
Grinnell.

“I came in with people wondering. who
was this freshman phenomenon?" said
Drake. Coming from a Chicago high school
strong in athletics, President Drake came
to Grinnell in 1950 intent on pursuing his
running in an atmosphere devoid of Divir
sion I pressure. Said Drake, ”I didn't want
my being in college to be primarily
because of runnin "

Running exhibition in the first cross
country meet of the season, “the
Freshman Phenom” lived up to his herald~
ed reputation, winning the race handily. “i
think I broke the course record by 2|) or 30
seconds.“ said Drake.

But as he told the '86 Cross Country
Squad, that was not such a good way to
begin. “You sort of establish in
everybody’s mind that there was this
phenomenal runner. George Drake, who of
course would win all the time,” he Said,
“and I had the notion I would win all the
time and should win all the time"

Expected to win, Drake focused on runn-
ing had his individual performance. His
weeks, as a rollercoaster ride, had highs
and lows. “Saturday, the day of the
event," said Drake, “tremendous
pressure, nervousness » and then the
event, Usually I’d done well enough to feel
great relief and elation 7 try to relax lor
about Zor a days and enjoy the high of a
good performance.” But towards the end
of the week, the rollercoaster would start
descending, “You’re" 'gonna get tested
again m was I gonna be a bad person or
good person again.” continued Drake,
“My total phyche was on the line.”

There was no question that George
Drake took his running seriously. Many
runners were short on concentration; for
Drake, “It was a constant mental battle."
Concerned with his intensity, his coaches
often tried to relieve his tension, One high
school coach did not take him to the site of
the state meet until the day of the race.

For Drake. a potential Division I athlete
running at a Division III school, it took
some time to learn he was beatable.

season he admits, “I quit the Conference
meet.” George Drake, who probably
would have finished fourth in that race,
realized on the final loop, “I might not win
ﬁlls race and," he continued “I quit.”

Citing a similar incident which occurred
in his Junior year in a dual meet against
Carleton, Drake said, “those were by far
the most traumatic experiences I had in
college.”

Favoring track over cross country,
President Drake felt more confident runnr
ing middle distances. “I liked track better
than cross country because I almost
always came through in track,” said
Drake. Running the mile, half mile, or
quarter mile, one doesn’t have to think too
long, The event doesn’t last long enough.
But cross country is more of a mental
sport, there are many more minutes to
drink about how things are going, are you
going to make it, should you pick up the
pace, etc. Said Drake, “It worked on me
more. Most runners like cross country bet-
ter than track, I was different.”

Winning the Conference mile his
Sophomore and Junior years, Drake prov-
ed himseli a tough contender with a per
sonal record of 4:24. With outstanding
records of 0:49 for the quarter and 1:53 for
the half, Drake took a hard look at his
times and changed his strategy Senior
year. As my times indicated, he explained,
l was stronger in the quarter and a half
mile leading his team to a Conference
championship As a Senior, Drake’s
outstanding track performance followed
an impressive second-place finish in the
Cross Country Conference Championship
which again, led Grinnell to a Conference
victory. The concept of placing second in a
Cross Country Conference. setting a school
record in the half mile, and winning the
quarter (as well as the mile) in a Cons
ferance meet, boggles many a runner’s
mind. Drake was outstanding, across the
boards,

President Drake pursued his Coma
petitive running career for two years alter
college. Directly out, he ran in the Paris
Cross Country Championship placing thir-
teenth overall. while pursuing his Rhodes
Scholarship at Oxford the following year,

Drake was chosen to run in the 0x-'

ford/Cambridge relays: a most

prestigious English event

Grinnell

George Drake, who can remember runnv
lng around a college obstacle course as a
third and fourth grader, neyer walked
anywhere as a child. “I can always
remember running.” he said, “I’ve always
loved to run.”

Drake sees a beauty in running, in the
aesthetics of the sport “The flow of the
body, the motion of the body . . . It’s like, i
suppose, a deer or a horse who wants to

run," he concluded ”that‘s the way I've '

always been.” Still running at the age of
titty-two, President Drake puts in his niree
or four miles a day and feels great, “I feel
as good as I did when I was in college." he
admitted, “although not as fast.”

Placing 44th in the ’54 Division I Na
tional Cross Country Championships,
President Drake never felt he “missed
out" by coming to Grinnell, In an i
dividual sport such as running, he explain-

ed. one always has the chance to compete
against the best, providing your times are
good enough. At Grinnell, Drake not only
participated in athletics, but was an active
member of the Choir, Glee Club and Stu-
dent Government as well.

But what of the other facets of the ”Grin-
nell Experience;; (i.e. academics)? Did
George Drake fall behind in history
readings due to extended workouts? On the
contrary, running year-round organized
Drake’s time, and put a kind of balance in
his life. “I needed that hour-andra-half of
doing something different with alot of
physical exercise,” he explained, . . it
was just absolutely essential." Essential
as well as invaluable, for as one student
asks, “How could he possibly maintain all
A's?” “Well," relented President Drake,
“I don’t think Grinnell was as tough then
as it is today."

Non-Varsity Fun '

i.e.ifun for those without letter jackets

8.]. Football

by Bob Litton

It’s a fun, simple game A bunch of guys
getting together on the weekend, throwing
around the pigskin. and scoring some
touchdowns. it’s‘a party! so why did the
college cancel intramural football?

Presumably it was due to the numerous
injuries after last year’s season Looking
out for the student’s best interest and per-
sonal safety, the college substituted foot-
ball with ultimate frisbee, in their minds a
much less harmful sport. Instead of argu-
ing with the administration about the cons
of their maneuver, in an attempt to
reinstate the flee-flicker and quarterback
roll-out, sophomore Eric Dahlin took it
upon himself to form his own special ins
terest rootball league

According to Dahlin, “There were a lot
of football players who missed the excites
ment of the game, and irisbee just didn’t
cut it, I figured that there was enough in-
terest to start a league. So I just tried it."
With the season coming to a close this
weekend - the best ball is definitely played
in polar bear weather - it seems as if
Dahlln's bold move has paid off. With the
exception of two norshows in an eight
season. special interest football has been
relatively hassle-free.

Participation is strong because those
guys that come out reallly enjoy playing
ball. Special interest football, \vithout
relerees or rigid organization, is much
more relaxed than I.M,’s. For Dahlin,
“Everyone seems to have a good time out
there. it is competitive. but no one is out
for blood."

Apparently someone was “out for blood”
last year, the main reason for the cancellar
tion of I,M.'s Dahlin feels that this is a poor
excuse to drop the program. He maintains
that the sport wasn’t the culprit for all the
injuries. He notes that many casualities

I.M. Soccer

by Lisa Fertlg

The sudden drastic change in the
weather seemed to foreshadow the end of
the IM Soccer season. The last few days of
the playoffs were cold ones as the extra
players cheered their teams on,
(sometimes calling the referee various
names i am probably not supposed to
know, much less publish) from the
sidelines in shorts and winter coats, their

' legs turning a pretty color purple. People

came to support their hall, and aside from
mere procrastination, they got the chance
to have some fun being with members of
the dorm,

I was a little disappointed at the uneven
ratio of males to females in IM soccer con-
sidering half of the fun is being able to play
on a co-ed team.

I am not sure if the lack of women para
ticipating in [M’s was due to intimidation
(afraid the guys would beat up on them) or
merely a lack oi interest. However, i do
know that my roommate and I, as well as
some others, did Venture out onto the field
to play (and I lived to tell all about it).

The overall level of competition wasn't
tierce; alter all, it isn't a varsity sport, 0n
the other hand, it's strange how one
becomes more competitive on the field
when he starts out playing simply for the
fun of it, Well, there’s always got to be a
winner, and some dorms played better
than others. Read was the winner of the
playoffs with 10 points, iiaines had the se-
cond highest number of points (3) followed
by Cleveland, who tied Dibble/Gates with
six points,
