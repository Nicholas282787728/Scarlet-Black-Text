Joint Board

in an unusually short meeting 7 under
halt an hour e Joint Board represen-
tatives received reports from cabinet
members and there was no new business,
except for Mike Oxman‘s inquiry into in
stalling basketball hoops at the Barber
Skating Plaza. The only other topic
brought up was the budget of the James
Hall Party, which, despite a $150 expen-
diture for crepe paper, still came out less
expensive than last year’s James Hall
Bacchanal.

That figure drew a few laughs from
those assembled, but Treasurer Robby
Sckalor explained that “$242 for decora-
tions ls about what parties [usually].

on to say that wide sheets of it were to be

The party is to be a “theme party"
centered on the Roaring menties. The

make a representation of a Prohibitionera

board, masking tape, paint, and brushes
will be made into cars in time for the para

The curriculum questionnaires have
been returned and tabulated, with the

Faculty split on
Parslow proposal

Vote possible on Monday

by Jim Hunter

Strong disagreement continues to
characterize the debate over the Parslow
Proposal, with the faculty unable to agree
even on who is eligible to vote. Beyond
such “procedural questions,” faculty
members are deeply divided between
those who support the proposal, and those
who desire more options than simply ace
cepting or rejecting the proposal.

The advising system, its advantages and
its inadequacies, continues to be a central
issue. Student participation also added a
new dimension to the debate as a few have
found the courage to speak.

President George Drake then noted that
while the conditions which the College
faces are not favorable for curricular
change, and his remarks at the previous
meeting were taken by some as a “kiss of
death” to the proposal, he did not intend
these statements as opposition to the pro-
posal,

The faculty engaged in lively discussion
of whether professors on sabbatical and
those teaching abroad should be granted
the right to vote.

The question was sent back to the Facul-
ty Organization Committee which will
recommend whether faculty on sabbatical
will be allowed to vote on the Parslow Pros
posal to the full faculty meeting set for
Monday.

The next issue was whether to ”receive”

the report which contains the proposal.
This was perceived as a procedural matter
but was subject to some debate, Professor
oi Philosophy Jack Worley voiced concern
that accepting the report left uie faculty
with a choice between two tragedies 7 the
tragedy of the present curriculum and that
ol the proposal. He sought discussion of
’uther Options. The faculty Voted over-
whelmingly to receive the report and get
on with the debate.
. Professor of French Morris Parslow
opened the discussion by engaging in what
he called “counterpunching” against op-
ponents of the proposal. in response to
Professor Worley's concern over alters
natives, Parslow argued that the only
realistic way to add structure to the cur-
riculum was to adopt requirements He
said that amendments could be made to
weaken the requirements. He viewed the
alternatives as voting (or, against or
amending the proposal.

Parslow then “counterpunched” Pro-
iessor ol Anthropology Ronald Kurtz‘s
“paper chin." Kurtz had previously sent a
memo to the faculty urging the rejection or
requirements. Parslow noted that the An-
thropology Department has made exten-
swc use of requirements within their ma-
jor. Kurtz later responded that comparing
major requirements to general education

Grenada to
Grinnell

The college responds

by Owen charles

The recent intervention of 1900 11.8.
Marines in the tiny island country of
Grenada has raised issues and concerns
internationally and also at Grinnell Col-
lege among students and professors

News stories have been ﬂying off the AP
wires and Grinnell professors and students
have responded, giving opinions and
analyses in interviews with student media.

on Wednesday night, KDIC broadcast a
one hour news special which included
editorial comment by Diane Sales and Jim
Bloyd, AP news updates, interviews with
political science professors Meyer, Hur-
witz, and Mitchell, and interviews with
students.

Diane Soles began the program reading
a prepared statement in which she ems
phasized the use of thesalines airport for
business and tourism in Grenada, rather

than alleged Soviet arms transport, Soles
also said that U.S, access to oil would not
be affected because of the many neighbor-
ing countries that can provide the same
service as Grenada, She said that the US.
is “undermining the sovereignty ol
Grenada" by acting upon the assumption
that it is a Cuban puppet regime.

In a KDIC interview, profesor John Hur-
witz suggested that Reagan's real motive
in sending troops might be to “do
something to boost his popularity” after
the massacre of marines in Lebanon. Pro
fessor Hurwitz further commented in an
ShB interview that he believed the presic
dent was not technically in violation of the
War Powers Act because it stipulates only
that the president must notify Congress
within 48 hours after intervention. Con»
gress can cut Off funding only after 60-90
days, in which time, said Hurwitz, “the

Representatives advise

pre-professionals

by Bud Vander Linden

Career Services sponsored a panel
discussion by representatives from seven
Chicago-area law schools on admissions
procedures, how to take LSATs, and
prepare letters of recommendation to law
school last Wednesday night in South
Lounge,

Richard Badger of the University of
Chicago Law School advised students
“not to take LSATs unless you prepare for
the exam twenty hours in advance.”
Badger recommended studens take the
Stanley Kaplan prep course if they are
“not selfcstarters” and wouldn’t otherwise
take the time to prepare for the exam,

“You should sit down and take a practice
test a week ahead of time to get to know
the structure of the exam," said Badger.
Badger emphasized the best way to
prepare for LSATs is by becoming very

familiar with the form of the test. Badger
said all answers on the exam are scored
the same, so if a student has a problem on
one question he should go on to a less dif-
ficult question,

James Faught of Loyola University said,

”The highest LSAT scores are recorded in
June arteriinal exams for the spring
semester are over," Hesaid students who

bomb the exam the first time around have
the chance to retake the exam, but that
many law schools tend to average the
scores it you take the test twice. Faught
emphasized that the student should be
prepared for the ﬁrst test they take so a
poor score ”dmn't come back to haunt
you.”

Northern Illinois University reprsen-
tative George Elliot said Admissions 0f-
fices scrutinize transcripts very closely to
determine the content of courses ap-
plicants take as undergraduates.

”Law schools tend to look at courses that
are heavily analytical instead or creative
in nature,” said Elliot.

Rita McDowell of John Marshall Law
School said students must be sure to follow
the admissions procedures of the institu-
tion they are applying too. when asking
professors for letters of recommendation
it’s best to remind the reference writerpf

past course work, said McDowell.

“it's not who writes the letter, it's What
they write about you,” said McDowell.
McDowell emphasized that it doesn't mat
ter ii a Full Professor or an Assistant pro
tessor writes the letter,

McDowell cautioned students against
sending letters irom public oiiicials who
really don’t know anything about your

. academic record or your character,
