Yes Virginia, there
are Buffer Days

The last issue ofthe Scarlet and Black
is without a doubt the most difﬁcult.
Writing ﬁnal papers and preparing for
exam while attempting to publish a
newspaper is no simple task as this
semester’s staff will easily attest, But,
rom this stress-inducing experience, I
have had a powerful realisation. Grin-
nell needs more buffer days!

Why this college, with a strong com.
mitment to providing one of the beat
educations in'the country continues to
hold to iLs medieval exam schedule is!
puzzling. The finals week schedule is
simply cruel and blatantly insensitive
to the quantity of work required by the
institution during the ﬁnal two weeks
of the semester. Although the Student
Affairs ofﬁce has often fought for the
student’s interests in the past, the utter
lack of concern for [buffer days
demonstrates how little understanding
administration hm of the plight of the
Grinnell student. '

Now, some may point out that the ad-
ministration itI the “Big White House”
on Park Street has been very kind in
establishing Saturday and Sunday as
“Buffer Days. " Yet, living in a country
where we have an actor as the Presi-
dent and where the National Enquirer
has the largest nationwide circulation,
we Grinnellians should not be surprised
by such displayals of absurdity, Hell. if
the administration can pace half of
North Campus for a parking lot, why
not label the weekend “Buffer Days."

The academic pressure at this school
can be almost unbearable and there is
no question that tieale ier arm better

when they are not half-awake and
under pressure. Professors dislike
grading poorly written papers as much
as students like writing them under
pressure. Then why not create more
buffer days. It seems inevitable that
"buffer days" would greatly improve
the quality of all xtutlcnt work and
make the conclusion afa course much
more academically rewarding.

Although it seems that the buffer
days issue seems to lie plagued with the
sortie apathetic attitudes in the divest-
ment issue. it is important that the stu-
deiit body and the faculty speak up and
proclaim the need for buffer days, If
the administration has to rearrange the
academic calendar then so be it. Giving
up o week of the summer break does
not seem such a high price in pay for
some time to take a breath to reﬂect on
the coursework during the past
semester.

We all must remember the words of
the brightly illuminated sign of
Highway 6,- iliis is Grinnell College not
The Crinnell Reformaiory School for
the Procrastinalor. As a college, Grin-
nell ought to concentrate on educating
students rather than shaping their
moral ﬁber, Crinnell is in the business
of educating people. Let us not end up
graduating neurotic, caffeine.
intoxicated baccalaitrcates.

creating REAL buffer days would aid
greatly in not only making a crinnell
oducation more fruitful but would
lessen the anxiety during a very
stressful period in any person’a h (2:

Homophobia Coverage Fair

Dear Editor:

I have lrequently read articles or letters
in the S and B with which I disagree and
yet I have responded to none. But none has
shown such grave ignorance or in
criminaled people as unjustly as Alex»
ander Rhoad’s letter of December 5, 19216.
Rhoads claims that the coverage of the
issue or homophobia on campus is simply a
case of “a lew people attempting to set the
agenda" (or the campus community. He
wonders why the s and B has quoted
“almost exclusively" Beth Johnson and
Kn}. Baker. Neither of these allegations is
lounded.

The first issue of the S and B which
covered the Gay Resource Center and
Human Resource Center was October 31.
1986. 0t the two articles on the trout page
dealing with the Centers (“Human
Resource Center Openslf’ and “...“..,Bil~
ter Dispute Resolved"), only one quotes
Beth or RJ. Bul Contrary to Rhoads' claim.

, the first person quoted is Bill Turner, and
the article also paraphrase: RA Julie
Fraser Editor John Harrison contributed
an editorial about the opening of the
Centers.

In the November 7 Scarlet and Black the
issue of homophobia first surfaced in prim.
A letter from Sara Dclchman, who had

' received one of the homophobic hale-mall
letters. is the only coverage ol
homophobia. Among others receiving the

- halermall were editor Harrison. although
it is not known whether this was because of
his favorable editorial on the Resource

Centers the previous week.

The November 14 edition of the
newspaper gave the most coverage of
homophobia to date: four articleS--three
on the iron! page-deal with how different
parLs ol the campus community were
beginning to respond. “Admin. Sets
Policy” reveals how the administration
was reacting. Quoted were Vice President
and Dean of Student Affairs Jim vTederr
man, Associate Dean of Student Affairs
Tom Crady. RA Julie Fraserpthe article
also notes that Tederman asserts that
‘“manymembersolihestailandPl-esidenl
Drake" had begun to take action, The
other articles in that issue dealing with
homophobia were “Student Survey;"
“Students Respond.” which quotes Beth
Johnson. R.J. Baker. and myself; and
“Faculty Denounces Homophobia Acts.”
At this point the administration was ac-
tively pursuing the perpetratons), and the
administration. faculty. and SGA had all
begun action to condemn the eels Are
these the “few people" to whom Rhoads
refers?

”Letter Apologizes for Homophobic
Acts” appeared in the November 2]
Scarlet and Black, the second of two issues
containing materials dealing with
homophobia. Certainly even Rhoads must
consider the apology letter newsworthy.
Wouldn't one also Consider ll Standard
journalistic practice to give thc victims in»
volved a chance to respond?

The responses of Johnson and Baker

were certainly representative of how
many of the victims felt Being one of the
people who had been interviewed the
previous week. Harrison gave me the op
portunity to respond But after Harrison
told me what Johnson and Baker had Said.
I didn't feel that I needed to add to their
statements,

Johnson’s and Baker's frustration is
eastly understandable They had been sub
jected to anonymous hate-mail and threats
of violence over an extended period of
lime. and the apology letter was far from
sufficient, And yet in spite of the fact that
the perpetrator claims morality as his
basis tor judgment and thinks of violence
as a means of solving family problems
(“(parenls), il...your son may be
gay.SHOOT HIM! "). Rhoads takes the op
portunity to assall Johnson and Baker for
not being more gracious in their accep-
Lance ot the apology. Indeed. if lheJetler
writer had wanted to apologize to the pco~
ple who had received letters. no one knew
better than the writer exactly who should
receive apologies, .
