Scarlrl It Black - Int. 5, 1E1

Fourth quarter dooms Pioneers again
32-10 setback wastes performances by Reid, McCrary, Traffa

by Jeff Raymond

Grinnell’s Pioneers went into the ear-
then Knox Bowl stadium in Galesburg last
week trying to avenge last year's 23-7 loss
in the same stadium, The Pioneers faced a
Slwash squad that was on a live game skid
and had a good opportunity to end their
own five game dry spell,

The Pioneers took the opening kickoff
from their own five yard line all the way
down the field to a touchdown just four and
one-half minutes into the game Gene Reid
and Mike McCrary both ran well in the
series that was quarterbacked by
sophomore Andy Hamilton,

Reid set up his touchdown with a third
down plunge to the three for a first down,
and Kevin Murphy‘s PAT boot was suc
cessful.

After the two teams traded punts, the
Siwash took over on their own to. Quarterr
back Paul Harada, who had thrown for an
incompletion on the previous series, drop
ped back and looked long on the first play.
Wide receiver Mark Dinges was covered
well by freshman David Dorsey but
Dorsey got turned around when the ball
arrived and Dinges held onto the pass and
raced In for the score. The PAT was block-
ed

Deiensive back Carmen Trotta stopped
Knox's first drive of the second quarter
with his first interception of the day and
got back to Grinnell's 48 yard line.

Reid carried for the Pioneers on the first
[our plays of the next drive, including a 41
yard burst on third down that put Grinnell
at Knox's six

McCrary tried to glide around left end on
second and goal irom the {we and app
peared to score easily However, a tlag
then dropped and Grinnell was slapped
with an olisides penalty that brought the
ball back out to the ten. The play was the
second of what Coach Ed Dombrowski
called “questionable" calls against the
Scarlet and Black. A batting call on a punt
earlier in the game against Grinnell led to
a touchback of 25 yards instead of the
usual 20
The Pioneers’ drive stalled at the Knox
seven, and Murphy was brought in to kick
a 23 yard field goal that boosted the Grin-
ncll lead to 1076 with three minutes left in
the half.

Knox took over with good field postion
but the Pioneer defense stiffened at mid
field and forced a punting Situation on
fourth down,

A surprise pass, however, caught the

punt return unit unaware and Knox had
another lirst down on the Gl'lnne1138. Rick
Brown, who would lead all rushers in the
day with 179 yards, galloped in for the
touchdown on the next play, The PAT pass
was knocked away, and the scored remain-
ed 12710, Knox

Despite the fact that there was less than
a minute lelt in the half, the Pioneers' or
lensive unit made a good eilort at retaking
the lead atter taking the kickoff on their
own 30.

McCrary ran an end around on second
down and did not stop until he was iorced
out at the opponent's 35. He took another
second clown carry for another iirst clown
at the Siwash 24.

Hamilton dropped back and spotted Mes
Crary curling over the middle and let ily a
pass to him, The ball was just in lront of
McCrary, though, and was intercepted on
the ten with less than ten seconds in the
hali, and Knox elected to run out the final
seconds.

By the end of the iirst hall. Reid had sur-
passed Tom Goetz's old single season
rushing record at Grinnell Reid ended the

day with 143 yards for the game and 1.054
in the season, with one game still to be
played. Goetz's record was 1,022 yards and
had stood since 1974,

The third quarter was battled to a
scoreless deadlock, Four punts, a tumble
recovering by linebacker Troy Barboza
and two interceptions, one or which was
Trotta's second of the day, marked the
period

Trolta picked olfa Harada pass that was
headed into the endzone at the five yard
line and rambled the full 95 yards for what
looked to be the go ahead score, Before the
celebration ended, though, the reieree
stepped off a 15 yard penalty [or an illegal
block (below the Waist) against the
Pioneers at the 24 yard line.

Grinnell drove inside the Knox 25 yard
line but a pass from Scott Stauffer, who
took over for Hamilton at the hall, was in
tercepted.

According to Dombrowski, “Andy did a
very fine job ” However, he felt that Stauf—
fer allows the offense more variety, and
Dombrowski was looking to open up the ol-
tense

Grinnell was bottled up in their own end
early in the iourth quarter, and Dom»
browski had Slaufler quick kick on third
down from the 37. The ball rolled to the
Knox one and was returned only two
yards,

The Pioneers, who had been able to rely
on their defense for most of the game, felt
conﬁdent that the game would turn at this
point Uniortunately, the defense sagged
and the game turned against Grinnell

Knox marched steadily downfleld, getr
ting to third down only twice and picking
up six first downs, two through the air.
Brown again inllicted the heavy damage
on the drive, picking up big first downs and
finally popping tor the touchdown irom the
two yard line The kick was again blocked
and the score remained 18710.

A touchdown and a two point conversion
would have tied the score and nearly seven
minutes remained to be played, so the
Pioneers still had a good change to get
back in the game as they prepared for the
return.

The kick bounced around before John
Jackson grabbed it around his Own 35 and
began running. Jackson is a defensive
back and is not used to running with the
ball, and this lack of experience was evi-
dent when he began his return. He was hit
near midfield and the ball, which was not
being protected properly, squirted loose
and a Knox player fell on it

Eight plays later, Eric Muehlliaiicr slid
around his left end from the one [or the
score, The successlul PAT made the score
2510, and tempers began to llare on both
sides

0n the ensuing Grlnnell drive, Reid
caught a pass near the sidelines and was
shoved out of bounds. He had to jump to
avoid hitting the bench and tell on the
hillside A Knox player yelled, “wok at
that. He's running away lrom us!"

implying that the league's second
leading rusher is airaid to play is a cheap
shot in anybody's book, and the Grinnell
bench nearly emptied to retaliate. Coaches
and reierees stepped in to prevent a melee,
and the game continued.

The drive ended at the Knox 30 and on
the iirst play, Knox's Jim Brown broke a
dive play for a 70 yard touchdown run The
PAT brought the final score to 32710

Dombrowskl said later that the team
“mentally got down,” late in the game, He
blamed several factors lor the lapse in at-
tention.
