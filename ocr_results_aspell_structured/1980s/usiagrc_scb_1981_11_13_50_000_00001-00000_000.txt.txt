by Marilyn 1. Clark

On Oct. 30, members or the coop house
at 1205 Park Street received a letter from
Jim Tederman, vice-president and dean of
student affairs, and Bob TownerLarsen,
assistant dean of student affairs and
director of housing. It stated, "All students
living in 1205 must have their belongings
out or the house by Dec. 20." The people
living in 1205 are Chris Barry, Steven
Elkes. Tony Gatto, Jelf Green. Phil Knaff,
Molly Metick. Don Montgomery, Eric
Rasmussen. Adam Springwater and Joe
Therrien

The letter was sent because furniture,
several pieces oi which are antiques worth
several thousands 0! dollars. had been
found in the house's attic Oct 27 This furc
niture had been stolen by some members
of the house ”by breaking into Loose and
Mears Halls, where the furniture was be
ing stored.“ according to the same letter.

The letter outlined the college's action in
one case. involving students breaking into
collegeowned buildings. and. in a second
case, involving students violating iire code
regulations by turning a locked attic into a
study lounge. The entire house was lined

entering Loose and Mears Halls, The
members were also to pay "damages tor
the door frame to the attic, the cost 01

moving the iurniture out oi the housc and
the cost of damages done to Mears Hall
during the breakci Their actions also
iorieited the group's right to live in the
house during second semester,

Because oi the gravity oi this incident.
the members or 1205 presented their ac-
count ol events to the SM; They discussed
the reasons why they decided to use the
attic as a study lounge. the actual break
ins at Loose and Mears. the discovery oi
the attlc's use and their ieelings about the
way the administration has treated the af-
fair,

During the llrSt week of classes about
five members oi 1205 decided to clean up
the attic and use it as a study room These
people gained access to the attic because

secure. "We did not damage the door as
charged in Tederman's letter," said Sprr
ingwater,

”The condition or the attic was more of a
tire hazard before we made it into a study
lounge," said Molly Melick. Don Mon-
tgomery said, "There were three bed
boards, window irames, old screens and
general debris in the attic."

"Our motive to break into the dorms was
to get furniture because the furniture in
the house was so bad," Melick said. Yet,
according to Barry, the house never got in
touch with the administration about get-
ting new iurniture tor the house.

"Sometime after Loose renovation
began. at around a or 4 a m., five members
of 1205 entered, but did not break into the
dorm," said Rasmussen They gained en-
try by climbing through an open window
on the second floor. These students remov~
ed two couches. one antique chair, two
tables and five mattresses from the Maid's
Lounge and the Hunter S Thompson room
with the use of a borrowed Car.

A few weeks later, two students from the
original group oi iive entered Mears
through an open window on the iirst iloor
side or the building iacing Burling Library,
They removed six, seven or eight blankets

Melick, Montgomery. Barry and Spr-
ingwater told the Shit that the furniture
takenl om the dorms was not Intended as
a mall ous act against the college, “We
decided as a group that theiurniture would
be returned at the end of the year," slated
Springwater, ”I thought it would be OK to
take the stuff because the furniture was
not being used," Melick said The
members involved in the breakrins did not
realize that some or the stolen pieces were
valuable antiques,

About two Weeks alter the stolen l'urr
niture was moved into the attic a Edit}
worker removed storm windows from this
room He did not report to the administra-
tion, however, that the attic was being us-
ed by students, On Oct. 23, the last Friday
oi break, the night watchman saw a light
on in the attic He reported this to Tederr
man because of the likelihood of the Fire
Marshall closing down collegerowned
houses if students did not cooperate by

keeping out or the attics. "This could
jeopardize the housing oi 153 students."
Tederman explained.

According to Item 13 0f the 1931432 col
lege contract ior cooperative residence
houses signed by all members of 1205.
"The college reserves the right upon at
least 12 hours notice to examine
cooperative houses regularly to assure
that adequate sanitary and safety condi»
tions are maintained." Yet some members
told the 5&3 that the college violated the
lZ~hour notice, because B&G entered the
house On Oct. 26 around 3]) m, without first
iniorming them

"If the attic was presenting an imr
mediate danger, why didn‘t the night wat-
chman come into the house Friday?" ask-
ed Rasmussen. "When We met with Teder-
man and Towner-Larsen and presented
them with violation DI the notice, they fell
back on the precedence the College Hand»
book has over contracts. But they never
told us that when we signed the contract,"
he added.

Tederman explained. however, "Accor-
ding to the contract, students will be ac-
countable for observing provisions oi the
contract and tor regulations contained in
the Handbook We felt there, was an im»
mediate danger so we entered the house
according to the Handbook's guidelines
Besides. they had breached the contract
earlier by breaking into the attic.” The
guideline in the Handbook reierred to by
Tederman states’ "Where harm to life,
saiety. health or property is reasonably
feared. entry shall be allowed without ad
vance notice." tp 42, Section 11, mt.

"When BK'G, ’l‘ederman and Townerr
Larsen came into 1205 on Oct 25 they did
not say anything to anyone in the house."
explained Rasmussen. "But they put a
lock on the attic dool‘, look one-half of the
iuriiitui-c out of the attic by throwing it his
disciminately down the stairs and then
lclt."

The next day more Baits people took the
rest of the furniture and "bedlrames.
trunks with our names on them and other
personal property," Rasmussen said
"when i tried to get our personal stuff
back someone from the B&G ollico hung
up on me," Melick complained, Later,
"They accused us at taking more blankets
than we had, They listed stuff we stored as
stolen items also,“ she added.

Rasmussen said he tried to get in touch
with TowncrLarsen's oiiice Wednesday oi
that ivcck, but was unsuccessful oh oct.

tiiially received a copy oi the letter quoted
in port at tho beginning oi the article
Some ol the house members told the Sit-K
that tlicy were upset because ol the blatant
accusatory tone oi the letter

"How can they condemn the anti house
on circumstantial evidence and also say
that we all are responsible when only live
people stoic the furniture?" asked
Rasmussen Einpliasizrng. the same point
Montgomery said, “The letter implied
group responsibility, There is not a direct
statement in the Handbook about group
responsibility except in cases involving
financial damage It is a tactic oi
totalitarian rule " Rasmussen concluded.
"Their actions seem to be in conilict with
the spirltofGrinnell. lt isa tyrannical way
at dealing with students,"

At the close of Tederman and ’l'owner-
Larsen's letter they wrote, “We are willing
to meetwith any oi you who wish todiscuss
this matter. .on Nov, 2 " Many members
told the sort that this statement em-
phasizes the "sneaky“ way the ad
mlnistratioll went about avoiding direct
communication with the students until
many days had passed "The tact that i
received the letter in my mailbox at 5:30
p in that Friday prevented me from doing
anything until the meeting Monday. ‘
