Being There was relatively suc-
cessful at me box office, but less so with
the critics. Peter Sellers is brilliant in
his leading role as a childish gardener
whose simplicity ls mistaken for
wisdom by political powers, The sup-
porting cast, cinematography and Hal
Ashby's direction are all excellent
(Melvin Douglas won an Oscar for Best
Supporting Actor in this film), yet it has
one basic flaw. Unlike his flamboyant
performances in films such as The Pan
ty, the character so convincingly por-
trayed by Sellers in Being There
is too small to Carry a lull-length film.
His character is very well developed.
but simply isn't deep enough to keep the
audience interested for two hours, That
may Sound like a contradiction, but it
isn't. The character's lack of depth is a
result of the fact that his only ex-
perience of the outside world comes
through television which leads to many
of the best comic moments in the film.
Even though it drags in places, the
many memorable performances make
Being There a film which is well
worth seeing. 7 T.S.

Along wlth The Bicycle Thiel, Rome,
Dpell City is one of the best of the neo-
realist films and probably the film most
responsible for introducing the technir
dues of nearrealism to the world. Moved
by the fall of Mussolini's regime,

, Rossehnl was one of the first artists to

try to show realistically the cir-
cumstances of the German occupation
of Italy and of the Italian Underground.
The film reeks with grim anger toward
the Germans. The story involves a
resistance leader who is being sought
by the Germans and seals protection
from the Underground, friends and a
priest. Their lllsfated involvement with
him and their hopelessness in [rent of
the Germans give the film a feeling of
despair as the inevitable endpoint of
human endeavor, a Viewpoint criticized
by western critics at the film's releaser
Nonetheless it does have a positive ele~
ment in its exaltation of devotion and
sacrifice to the cause of freedom and to
the people of that cause. It is perhaps
less realistic than The Bicycle Thief in
that a few interior sets were used along
with many professional actors and at
times it is dramatized for effect. Still, it
maintains most nee-realist conten»
tions. a lack of cllches, an honesty in
depicting human problems and above
all a belief thatan undistorted depiction
oi ordinary Circumstances will itself
prolect the underlying feeling and

Appropriately. the ﬁrst film in the
American Studies Film Series is the
first of Frank Capra's social commenr
tary/comeoiy iilms. And it is terrific!
Although it might seem a bit slow com-
pared to today's films, its satire and wit
more than compensate, Gary Cooper is
fine as Longfellow Deeds, a small town

derily inherits $20 million. Unfortunate-l

help people ta rather pixillated" no-
tion indeedl instead of "investing" it in_
some con men's schemes, he is {ought
at every step. There‘s a great cour~ i
[room scene in which Deeds" ability to
