Maybe Grinnell will

have an ice rink

after all

by Grant Ehrlich

Not too long ago. students at
Grinnell College had their own ice
rink. This ice rink. located 0"
Barber Plaza between lhe librarv
and tiie Fine Arts building. was a
great winter-time institution Then
along came the energy crunch of
1973. and the Ice rink was discons
tinned. Now that the energy crunch
is over. and students are looking
for on-campus recreation. the ice
rink is being reexamined.

Physically. Barber Plaza is not
an ideal rink. but it is far irom
primitive. in a phone conversation
with Physical Plant, it was learned
that Barber Plaza has cooling coils
under the concrete slab which will
keep the suriace irozen when the
ambient temperature is about 40
degrees on an overcast day.
Although it the sun is out. this
iigure can tall as low as below
ireezing. The coils. which are ac-
tually pipes. are run oil the air»
conditioning system oi the Fine
Arts building. The other major face
tor that affects the surface is wind;
a shit breeze can greatly increase
the rate of sublimation oi the ice.
although this can be controlled
with boards used to block the wind.
As you probably have noticed, the
plaza is lighted, so there could he

lithe rink were erected. its utilir
ty would be limited only by our ims

The Management Information Consulting Division of
Arthur Andersen 8 Co. will be conducting campus
interviews for staff consultant positions October 30, 1987.

We invite undergraduate students who would like to
work in a fast-paced client-oriented environment to apply
for these interviews by submitting resumes to the Career

Development Office or to:

suggests SGA president Liz
Johnson. Maybe some minirrink
hockey. or just plain old skating
around; corp has about 20 pairs oi
ice skates for tree loan if you
return them on tlme

So why not have the rink? As of
this writing, our SGA president
had not met with Jim ’l‘ederman, to
whom Acting President Waldo
Walker has left the ice-rink deci-
sion. Although Mr. Tederman was
out of town and could not be reachs
ed for Comment. Liz Johnson said
that the only major gripe the col~
lege has is that they currently sub-
sidize the city‘s rink at 11th and
145th. There are some maior pros
blems with the city's rink. which is
basically water poured into a pool
made with a big plastic tarp Last
year. the rink did not freeze That
was one problem The other is that
when skaters try to skate on a
hall'lvaysl'rozen rink, the skates
pierce the plastic and all the water
runs out. That is another problem.
in addition. iew people on campus
know oi the city's rink Because
the rink is somewhat removed
irom campus. l doubt it will ever
be the social center Barber Plaza
could he.

Students interested in an ice rink
should voice their opinions to our
SGA president. Liz Johnson. or
should send a message to Jim
Tederman.

the students into an uproar, as was
evidenced by the letters written
last week in response to his pro-
posal. The only concrete idea tor a
core curriculum. in which 16
credits would be devoted to each
division opposite one's major, was
put iorth by Ali Elsail'ar. who’s
pretty darn iniluential. but still no

If you've read this column
beiore. you can probably guess
that I‘m definitely opposed to a
core curriculum. Forgetting the in
tellectual issues tor a moment,
let’s be honest. i remember almost
laughing out loud when, as a pro
spective. I realized that i would
never have to dissect a dead thing
or purchase the millionsdollar
chem textbook, ii i so desired. And
I know that more than one physics
majors mouth began watering
when he or she became aware that
they would never be required to

The solution is more complex
than writing a list. Clearly, any list
will be incomplete since it contains
a iinite number oi objects.
However. if one is instilled with a
desire to read and learn. the poten-
tial for knowledge is infinite. In»
stead oi giving a student a list oi
things to memorize and
regurgitate during a test. teach
him to enjoy reading, He'll learn
the same things on his own and
remember them tar after any test.

Native
Continued from Page 9

As the symposium taught us.
Native Americans do not create
the categories so typical oi
Western culture. Nature. humans.
and the land came irom the same
creation and are equal; there is no
division between the secular and
the spiritual. So the symposium
showed the dualism which we oiten
expect is a culture-bound category.
For our Native
speakers, the division between
their lives and the generalized
tacts about Native Americans did
not exist. They did not impers
sonalize their experiences; they
spoke oi them and held them up as
an example or all Native
Americans. Those oi us who ex-
pected a division along the lines oi
Western culture were surprised
and oiten uncomiortaole when our
expectations were not met. But.
recognizing the source of this
discomiort, maybe we can become _
more aware and learn more in
