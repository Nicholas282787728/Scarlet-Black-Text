SGA creates fund
to augment budget

Telethon. will solicit funds
from recent graduates

by Mike Alexander

Concern has been generated recently by
rising entertainment costs and the subse-
quent need for reducing either the quantity
or the quality of SGA iunded student ac
tivities. To keep up with these rising exr
penses. a new program will be instituted to
supplement the iunds used tor social pro
grams The Student Government Associa
tion has. at their own initiative. created a
Student Activities Endowment project ior
the enrichment 01 student life for future
classes.

Every year. the college organizes its An-
nual Fund Telethon to try to collect donav
tions irom the alumni to help in covering
operating costs The new program is going
to propose that the three most recent
graduating classes donate money to this
new fund rather than to the Annual Fund

The need for greater funds in order to
continue to provide a high quality social
activities calendar is obvious. according to
SGA President Doug Rowe. "lt's impors
tant that Grinnell. given its Isolation. pro
vide recreation for the students In order
to maintain. and hopelully to improve. the
present program. we are establishing this
endowment. the interest from which will
be used to supplement the activity fee."

. said Rowe.

The money raised will be incorporated
into the college‘s endowment iunds in
order to take advantageoi the higher in
terest available through the greater prinr

cipal. This interest will be used to help offr -

set the rising cost of providing social pro
grams ior Grinnell students as a part oi

the student Government's budget

When questioned about the relatively
low participation level oi the recent
graduating classes in the Annual Fund
Telethons. SGA VicesPresident Teri Gould
said. "What we're trying to do is emr
phasize small donations. Even tiny con
tributions appear si ilicant to a iund
starting from scratch." Added Rowe. "We
think that members of these classes will be
the most aware or the need for an improv-
lng social program and will hopeiully give
despite their limited incomes."

The principal siooou. which is the goal
for this year, will not be Spent but instead
will be included in the college's general en-
dowment fund and will receive Shares of
the power oi investment

"It‘ll all be handled by the trustees."
said Rowe. “The students won't be handls
ing the money Instead. this fund Will be
like a share oi the pie. Only the interest
gained from the money will be added to the
existing Social Coordinator's Activity
Fund. It will be used to supplement the
social programming budget in a manner
determined annually by the SGA Jomt
Board at their budget meeting. It's felt
that this system will allow the flexibility
needed to best meet student needs."

The new telethon should keep raises in
the activities fee to a minimum. If the fund
is successfully established. it will make a
substantial contribution to the budget and
will help maintain the college's high stan
dard of social programming in perpetuity.

Grinnell to host
Project Equality

conference in spring

by Marty Meilotto

This spring. the College Entrance Ex-
amination Board will sponsor a sym-
posium on the Grinneil College campus
which will bring together iaculty members
from Iowa high schools and universities
The goal of the discussion is to find better
ways ior both insitutions to prepare col
lege bound high school students for secon»
dary education.

The symposium. one oi 24 throughout the
nation. will be part of the College Board's
Project Equality. A major goal at this pro~
ject, according to a College Board pains
phlet. is to "strengthen the prepai-atio oi
all students with college aspiration ' To
reach this goal they will prepare. and
publish statements about the preparation
that college-bound students should have in
the iollewing six academic subject areas:
English. math. social studies. language,
art and natural science. The symposiums
will be the main vehicle for researching
these statements. The Grinnell sym-
posium will deal specitically with ways in
which to improve social studies Curr
riculum in high schools.

interest ior Project Equality was first
expressed by Admissions Office staff. who
ielt that courses currently being taught in
public high schools might not adequately
prepare students for college work Accorr
ding to John Hopkins. director of Admisr
sions and Financial Aid. "Such a program
[Operation Equalityl would do much more
to articulate between high school our
riculum and college curriculum expectas
tion. " Hopkins explained that it was

customary ior colleges to blame and
criticize high schools for the decline of
quality students entering higher education
without offering any constructive advice
on how toimprove things. “With Operation
Equality we can change that , . and by
working together produce students who
can produce better work in college." said
Hopkins

Such sentiments were also expressed by
Catherine Frazer. dean oi iaculty and the
chief organizer ior Project Equality in
Grinncll. Dean Frazer mentioned that
Grinnell started its own dialogue with
Grinnell high school teachers and iaculty
in March. 1981. John Valentine was a
member oi the College Board who recom-
mended Grinnell as one oi the Board's
symposium sites presumably because oi
what he saw at the March meeting. Accors
ding to Frazer. "It has been and will con.
tinue to be Grinnell‘s goal to make sure
that the student will be prepared for coir
lege work. both for the student's benciit

and for the college "

While both the AdmiSSiOnS Office and
Dean Frazer's Office have expressed op-
timism over this project. it has not moved
beyond the conception stage. Details oi the
symposium. including the exact date and
who will be invited. have not been worked
out as or press time Dean Frazer‘s oilice
estimates that one-half of those invited will
be high School teachers and the other half
will represent college iaculty and come
munity leaders,

There are two options.

Health Center
focelifi

tn the past few weeks the Health
Center has undergone a iaceliit, Accorr
ding to the Health Center Director Ana
drea Griswold. the changes help to give
the center a “more pleasant physical
environment."

One of the changes is a complete in

.terior painting The walls were painted

in numerous shades oi coordinating
earth~tones. It is hoped that these colors
will pmve to be soothing to both the
staff and student patients. In addition.
pamphlet shelves were installed in the
lobby and a bookshelf/coatrack unit in
the treatment room. Also. the center's
kitchen was redone in order to ease the
job oi meal preparation for patients and
the worn and rusted kitchen fixtures
were replaced.

Griswald explained the renewed in
terest in the Health Center by sug-
gesting. "Last spring the decision was
made to keep the Health Center which
impliesacommitment to the centerand
its improvement "

There are plans for additional
physical improvements in the coming
months A microwave oven will be add~
ed to the kitchen and the venetian
blinds throughout the building will he
removed. The blinds present a constant
challenge to keep clean and free irom
dust, without the blinds. allergy suf~
ferers should find the center a more

. desirable environment.

Griswold plans improvements in stus
dent services as well. Around the time
of spring break she hopes to be assigned
a car for student transportation to and
irom doctor‘s appointments. Currently.
the college uses taxis for this purpose at
a cost oi $5 per round trip. There are
also plans to add one screening test to
the services offered to students.
Although she did not speciiy which test
would be offered. Griswold did indicate
that it would be "one which would be
greatly used by students.” A greater
emphasis on preventative medicine and
education is also a priority ior the
center. A greater supply at pamphlets
is already available to students iree oi
charge

Greater use of the Health Center has
also been evident this year. This in-
crease was caused by a greater irquen
cy of illness as well as a greater
awareness by students oi Health Center
services. Griswald describes inpatient
care as a sort of "hallway house:
studentswhoare toosick to take care ol
themselves In the dorm but not sick
enough for hospital care may check
themselves into the center However.
the center will also welcome students
who just need a good night's sleep. The
center has a capacity oi seven students
but can easily accommodate more or
mum
