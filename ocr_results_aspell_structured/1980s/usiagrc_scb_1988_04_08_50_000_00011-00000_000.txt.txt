Exclusive Interview with Bill Gehret

by Bruce Emond

From his appearance, one would
not easily guess Bill Gehret's two
professions. A tall, broadr
shouldered, heavy man of 42,
Gehret Juggles jobs as a traveling
women's undergarment salesman
and a NCAA referee for Divisional
basketball and football A native of
Pittsburgh. Gehret attended Penn
State, receiving a degree in
business administration. He mar-
ried after graduating and had two
children, but he attributes the
subsequent break-up of his mar-
ria ge to the extensive traveling re-
quired for refereeing, During a
muchrneeded break in New
Orleans this past March, Gehret
discussed the demands and
rewards of his refereeing work.

working Notre Dame, Penn State,
Syracuse games [in football]. At
that time I was working Seton Hall,
Columbia, St, John's — teams of
that. nature ~ in basketball. That
was before they formed the Atlanr
tic Ten 1 have been working the
major independents ever since.

Q. How often do you referee?

A l referee about 10 football
games in a regular season.
Sometimes you are offered games
in other leagues. Like they use a
unit of referees for Big Eight and
Atlantic 10 games They use some

the Conference. Or they use all
neutral officials The assignment
committee knows the games you

the pace they do.

9. i remember a few years ago
there was a scandal at the Univer-
sity of Georgia in which faculty
were instructed to pass student
athletes who were practically i1»
literate. What do you think about
giving college athletes breaks”

A. This is totally partial. so 1
don't want you to think it
represents the views of all
referees. i believe you have to
create your own GPA, Kids i knew
who went to the pros and didn't
wait to get their degree are washed
up now. With a college degree, you
have something to fall back on. But
i think every student should have
an extra-curricular activity.

Q. You said before that student
athlete are humiliated by the
system what did you mean?

A Humiliated is the wrong word
Exploited is better. College
athletes get a scholarship, but it
they don't perlorm, they lthe
schooll get someone else. it
doesn't mean a can of beans to a
coach. The press can really make
or break a student's career. i wish
more newspapers would support
college athletes. You see a big
write up about a kid and then sud~
denly they are not there.

Pioneers Crush Upper
Iowa in First Win

Since 1985

A significant sign of spring unr
folded last Thursday as the Grins
nell women’s softball team Com-
menced its season with a hearten»
mg 7-3 victory over Upper Iowa,

The Pioneers had to withdraw
from the Midwest Conference last
year due to a lack ol numbeis. The
win was the team's first NCAA
Division-III Victory since April 6,
1985.

The Lady Pioneers played the
defending champion Monmouth at
Monmouth, Illinois. on Thursday,
and will host Knox in the home
opener on Saturday at 1 pm.

“This is the epitome of a
rebuilding season for us,“ Coach
Jim Gilbert Commented. “After
our struggles last year, it's ex-
citing to have a dedicated group of
upperclassmen who are com-
plemented by talented freshmen.
We're a very young team, and we
certainly have a good base on
which we can rebuild.”

Although he was pleased wnh the
offensive production in the opener,
which included 7 runs on 5 hits,
Gilbert feels that the defense was
the key to Grinnell's victory, He
cited the play of infielders Neva
Specht at third base, Pam Frese at
shortstop, Diana Lewis at second
and Gini Frazer at first The out-

field consists of Jeannie Robinson,
Erin Davison, and Karen Glenn-
meir

Freshman pitcher Mary
Allenberg turned in an outstanding
performance, walking only one
batter and limiting Upper Iowa to 3
runs. Allenberg also had a hill at
run, and a stolen base. Lewis,
Davison, Robinson and catcher
Judy Thorn had the other Grinnell
hits.

”Our goal for the season," Coach
Gilbert stressed, “is to play a good
game every time out. We know
competition will get tougher and
people don't expect much from us.
but hopefully we'll surprise a few
teams. Certainly we have the right
attitude!"
