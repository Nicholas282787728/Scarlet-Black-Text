Good to the last drop

Lately this campus has fallen prey to
a very good intention. which has
nonetheless been so poorly expressed
as to make itself ridiculous. I refer, of
course, to the campus-wide quests for
equality we have been reading about.
First. there was a proposal to establish
an SGA referendum system. much
needed because many people who had
wanted to sponsor referenda and even
had hundreds of signers on petitions to
hold referenda had no clear idea of how
to do this.

Suddenly. it was possible to offer up
several referenda every month. This
has the unfortunate effect of making all
of us take these proposals less serious-
ly. Granted. they are about some very
serious problems. but an SGA proposal
in and of itself does nothing to stop
apartheid or (1.5 involvement in Cen~
tral America. [s only value is symbolic
value. and that the presence oi an occa»
sional referendum may bring such pro»
blems to the attention of those who
,don't join organizations or read the
newspapers very much. This value is
not to be underestimated.

The more thorns placed in our con-
sciousness. the more likely we are to
wonder. “How did apartheid happen.
anyway". What are we doing in Central
Americ ” This is a good thing. It is
called "an informed electorate“. and it
was one of the ideas that was supposed
to make this country something called a
“democracy"

What especially makes us take these
referenda less seriously. is that they
have the potential to ask us to make
wholly ignorant votes. The last one was
a case in point. The first proposal was
on whether or not to create the position
of RHA, It was sort of unclear why this
was brought up for a reierendurn. since
few of the people voting knew why or
for what they were voting. Was its pro-
blem to create the position because
SGA would have to sacrifice something
else the students cared about in order to
pay the prospective RHAs? Was it a
problem of whether or not to give
students a certain kind of power over
other students? All of these CDiiSldera-
tions remained foggy. at least in this
humble brain.

The second referendum last time was
the infamous quota vote for encourage
ing numbers of black students. faculty
and staff to be in proportion with the
percentage of blacks in the population.
The problem is that a referendum such
as this has no teeth in it at all. Departs
ments which have been trying to in

crease general recruitment of blacks
have found it very difficult, It is not the
easiest thing in the world to be black in
Grinnell, Iowa, and we have therefore
had several notably qualified people
say that they couldn't bear to live here
Saying that we should have more black
people here doesn’t make It so. There
are no shortages of examples around
campus of programs which try to make
it easier for black people to come here,

but it doesn't seem to be working as
quickly as it should. Offering up a
reierendum which condemns the Ad-

ministration for having good intentions .

but not producing the results we all
want wastes the symbolic power of our
referendum.

u.

By the way. did anyone's class talk
about women on May 1. International
Women’s Day'.7 It was announced on
posters around campus that they
would. but perhaps the professors were
not asked far enough in advance to give
such lectures It is a shame that this
was to take place so close to finals that
professors probably found it difficult to
jettison parts of class readings that
everyone was struggling to {it in at the
last moment. Perhaps this command to
discuss women in our classes was, like
the referenda. another way of attemp-
ting to prove that “Wishing will make it
so",

It is also a shame that the organizers
of this consciousness raising. despite
the fact that women are 51 percent of
the population. are willing to be a sub-

ject for a token day once a year. Can’t
we discuss important things women -
have done when they arise twhich is
ofteni?

Results of the “most horrible cultural
result of the seventies" contest were in-
concluswe. Fashions of the seventies
were first to peoples' minds. Gretchen
Fisher reminded me about bellrbottom
pants. Doug Zang’s pet peeve was
leisure suits. although his musical addi-
tion was the Village People. A group of
dinner companions launched into a
medley of such swell hits as the Andrea
True CDnnection’s “More. More. More
(How Do You Like It'll". one of those
rare songs with no words to it that
aren't in the title.

Sorry to say this. but I would like to
launch the first nomination for “Most
horrible cultural result of the eighties”.
I hope that in the remaining four-anda
half years of this decade there will be
nothing to rival $300 fur coats for Cab-
bage Patch Dolls. Just when you think
you've seen it all . ..
