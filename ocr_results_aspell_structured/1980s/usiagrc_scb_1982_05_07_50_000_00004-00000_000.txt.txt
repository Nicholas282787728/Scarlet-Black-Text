Students Sllﬂlllll fill.
committees DBIDI‘B

At the administration forum last week Chairman of the Faculty Mor-
ris Parslow pointed out that students might have been able to avert the
F-grade decision last year but no students on the Curriculum Committee
were at the meetings. According to the campus directory for faculty and
administration, four students are supposed to be on this committee. Apr
parently, none volunteered for the positions or they did not bother to at-
tend the meetings on the Frgrade.

If in the future Grinnell students want to effectively voice any opinions
or arguments to the administration about its decisions we should make
sure all of the committees we may hold positions on are filled and well
attended. There is no excuse not to participate on these committees,
especially if students disagree with the decisions committees have
made in the past. It is also embarassing to have an argument destroyed
because of our own negligence.

Committees which have student positions include the committees on.

Admissions and Student Financial Aid, Curriculum, Library and Book
Store, Public Events, Physical Education, Student Publications and
Radio, Student Life, the All-College Judicial Council, the Rosenfield
Program in Public Affairs, International Relations and Human Rights,
and the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee. In addition to these
committees, students are supposed to be on all of the educational policy
committees.

Some of the committees are interviewing applicants now. Some have
already selected members for next year. Vice President and Dean of
Student Affairs James Tederman said applications “are way up” for the
committee positions so far. According to Tederman, 23 students applied
to be on the student life committee. This enthusiasm is encouraging and
should continue. But after being appointed to the various positions
students must attend the meetings regularly.

Tederman said one problem this year was that students did not show
up for committee meetings and they used alternates so often that it was
difficult to make any progress during meetings because it was
necessary to explain the issues to the alternates, However, Tederman
pointed out, absenteeism was not a problem this year in the Committee
on Student Life. It seems ridiculous, then, that students complain most
about decisions made by committees they could have been on but were
not, such as the Curriculum Committee.

Another important fact that most students overlook is that all
meetings of these committees are open to any students, not only the
members. Non—members also may make proposals. So we do not have to
rely solely on appointed committee members to govern what goes on in
meetings.

If we take advantage of our own power and fill our committee posi-
tions we may be taken more seriously by the administration and not end
up disagreeing wiﬂi decisions we might have been able to influence by
attending the committee meetings.

Updating divestment

“Time Is Running Out” is the title of the
recent Rockefeller Foundation study on
South Africa Time is running out, now
more than ever in South Africa, In the past
iew years hopes have been raised by the
election of a new government which pledg-
ed reforms in South Africa and by an at-
tempt at reform through the United States
corporations and the Sullivan Principles.
Neither of these hopes have been fulfilled,

The government of P.W. Botha, while it
still speaks the rhetoric of reform, has con
tinued to use strong measures in dealing
with the black majority. Detentions
without trial continue, student demonstrar
tions are met with tear gas and more
political leaders and journalists are being
banned. Furthermore, the South African
government has taken its defense of apar-
theid beyond its own borders. Government
iorcec have made two major raids into
Angola in the last nine months killing
several hundred and leaVlng over one hun-
dred thousand homeless. In addition, they
have been accused of subversion and
assassination inside the borders of
Mozambique and Zimbabwe.

The news on the corporate front is not
any better. Reports irom South Africa in

ing for divestment. Black leaders View the

T0 the Editor:

My turn. I've coasted through here for
most of the last two semesters and have re
mained pretty apathetic towards most of
the earth shattering issues on campus.
However, most students seem to take the
same approach toward the world at large,

When controversy came up over the
name of the James Gang Bang, I was a lltr
tie too concerned with Reaganomics to pay
much attention. I use the computer system
but I never really knew who Grundler or
Renaud was. I will admit to being a bit
bummed when I learned that Mr, Jacobson
didn't get tenure, but since he didn't get as
much jaw time as the other guy (whom i
haven't taken any classes from), I guess
his case isn't considered a worthy cause,

I'll admit that the Loose hall ball had
some Sexist and racist connotations 7 but
I've been a member of the football team
and I realize that most of it was due to pure
ignorance rather than malicious intent.
(Maybe the problem wasn’t with the
members or the hall that threw the party,
but with whoever chose a singlesex dorm
to throw it.)

The funny thing is, when [occasionally
ask students what they think about the
Faulkland issue, they often giggle, profess

a degree of naivete and treat me as if I .

have asked a very trivial and parochial
question. It‘s true that such campus issues
are important, but the chance of someone
dying over them is terribly remote.

Just like most studens, l have yet to
engage in an honest, open conversation
with Mr, Maytag. Grinnell has promised
many things to me, but i don't recall a
private audience with the trustees as being
one of them. On the other hand, I can see
three or four movies every weekend, go to
an alcoholic pub on campus, use a top rate
athletic facility and talk to the college
president at the forum.

Not having grown up rich or in a city,

argue that the Sullivan Principles operate
only in the work place and have no effect
on apartheid itself

in 1978, Fortune published a scathing at-
tack on divestment, in which itextensively
quoted black South African newspaper
editor Percy Qoboza, arguing that con-
tinued corporate investment could help to
avert a bloodbaﬂi in South Africa. It is
significant to note that according to
former Senator Dick Clark, Qoboza has
recently come out in iavor of divestment.
Another black leader who has changed his
mind about divestment is South African
Bishop Desmond Tutu. who states that
economic pressure from abroad is indeed
the only way to avert a bloodbath.

Finally, the Reagan Administration has
effectively reduced pressure on South
Africa during its veto of United Nations
resolutions condemning the invasion oi
Angola and through many other actions.
As Dick Clark noted in his recent remarks
at Grinnell, such policies make pressure
from the private sector all the more impor-
tant. But time is running out in Grinnell as
well as South Africa, therefore, the South
African Support Group urges all concern
ed members of the Grinnell community to
attend today's rally supporting divest
merit.

SASES EIIIOIODV ’
fﬂl' WE SHIP

To the Editor:

As coordinator of this year's FOG Fast I
feel i owe something of an apology, in the
traditional sense of the word, to the cam-
pus community. A small rage brewed last
week over some of the statements SASES
printed on its table tents and in the Cam»
pus Memo. The statements depicted a sarr
castic, antirFood Service attitude and the
rage was epitomized by Tim Warcham’s
letter to the editor (5&3, April 30), “This
humorous invitation (ha! ha! laughs the
refugee family wondering where they will
next have a meal). . . is most depressing."

Students Against Suffering: El
Salvador, myself in particular, take . full
responsibility for the statements. But
while the comments reek of negligence,
there is a sound premise on which SASES'
actions were based. SASES has been rais-
ing funds for Salvadoran Refugees for
three consecutive semesters. During this
time we have learned a fair amount about
how to get the greatest number oi students
to respond to our efforts, Last semester we
organized a fund raiser during which dona-
tions were requested, Our plan was to
“enlighten" the campus about El
Salvador, The assumption was that
knowledge of the refugee situation would
lead to concern, and concern would lead to
donations. I should note that the funds
don’t get lost in red tape, where they func
tion solely as expressions oi concern. but
are channelled quickly and efficiently into
areas where they are greatly needed.

The result of the fundraiser was dismal.
SGA shelled out more funds for films and
literature than what was raised. So much
.for the concern. , .

It is in this light that SASES has opted
