by Marilyn Clark, Laura Carter

“separatism in a Liberal Arts Setting"
was the topic oI discussion at a black
forum held April 23 by ﬁve students:
Russell Pierce, Anthony Murry, Donna
Olds, Cathy Hill and Chris Johnson.
This meeting was organized by black
students who l'elt the need to address
assertions made about the black coms
munily to the effect that it was
segregated from the rest of the campus.
The forum Iocused on areas which
some people could perceive as in-
dicating separatism.

The first topic addressed was the
black housing policy. According to the

cluster ﬂoor but will still have the 0p»
tion of living with a roommate of the
same race.

Student opinion on this subject was
mixed at the forum, According to
Johnson, “The black cluster system
helps people come together because
they are black." Hill clarified this by
stating, “It helps black students to get
used to living in a white dominated set
ting, When blacks live in closer prox-
imity, it helps them to get adjusted
easier to Grinnell.” Olds presented the
view, “If freshmen are placed on a
Cluster [loor they do not have to deal by

college's statement: ”The housing
committee supports the idea that Grin-
nell College ought to provide a housing
system which guarantees groups of up
perclass black students to live in prox»
imily on the same residence hall
ﬂoor(s). In addition, in order to make
the adjustment to Grinnell easier and
more comfortable for incoming black
students, are housing committee sup
ports the idea that the housing office
provide comparable housing choices to
incoming black students."

The policy thus allows groups oi
black students to draw into the same
residence hall floor, According to Susan
Wittpenn. associate dean of Student Air
fairs and director of housing, “This
policy originated years ago when peo-
ple believed that the small number oi
black students on campus should have
the option of living on the same floor in
groups." In her opinion, “Some people
might suppose the black cluster system
is separatist, yet it is a necessary option
because the black population is so
small." However, no upperclassmen
have chosen to live on a cluster floor
next year. Incoming black freshmen.
therefore, will not be able to live on a

themselves with the culture shock of
Grinnell. Upperclassmen help them to
adjust.” Overall, the students at the
iorum viewed the cluster system as a
positive, individual choice made by
black students.

In individual interviews other
students shared their views. An exam-
ple or a black student who lived on a
cluster floor is Murry, who came irom a
predominately black high school. He
said the cluster ”was very helpful” in
his initial adjustment to Grinnell.

Lupe Barron, or Hispanic descent,
stated, “The cluster system is based on
cultural support, not on a iorm oi
separatism. it is a way to share one‘s
ethnic identity." In another opinion,
Bill Ogilvie, a white student, said,
“There are no problems with the
cluster system because It is an in»
dividual prelerence. There will only be
a problem if people apply negative con-
notations to it."

”The cluster system may be one way
to alleviate culture shock," Said Linda
Pavela, a white student. on a different
note, however, Lesley Williams stated,
“The cluster system is an example of a
way to make it easy for black students

to avoid lully interacting with other
students, It is important for black and
white students to really know each
other and barriers like the cluster
system aliect too many people and pre-
vent Grinnell from being completely in-
tegrated "

Another topic discussed was in»
dividual opinion on separatism at Grin-
nell, Johnson slated, “Some students
may perceive separatism as existing on
campus but there is no definite
separatism at Grinnell." He stressed
that “it black students present events to
the campus such as poetry readings,
lectures and receptions for people like
Julian Bond at the Black Cultural
Center how can they be perceived as
separatists? These events are open to
all and do not denote separatism "
Johnson believed that the major pro
blem on campus is "not on black or
white students in particular but on the
need ior more integration among both
races,"

Yet Jonathan Nelson believed that
“separatism does occur at Grinnell "
However, Nelson does not think that in
creasing black enrollment will increase
the amount of interaction between
black and white students. He stated.
“More black students will not change
the attitude of students who do not Want
to interact together. The attitude on this
issue needs to be changed ﬁrst."

Karen Culmer added to this theme by
saying ”to a certain extent Grinnell is
not very liberal or well integrated. A
true liberal arts college would have
more minority students. Grinnell needs
more black students to increase diver-
sity." Murry inrther commented.
”Grinnell is supposed to have a liberal
and diverse student body; having more
black students would add to it. White
students exposed to more blacks would
learn more by sharing experiences."

Williams believed, however, that “no
one Is willingly segregating. Yet, the
(act that black students are not involv-
ed in many activities is noticeable
Black students are more comfortable
with other black students and this can
develop into a crutch," Andrew Stein, 3
white student, said, “Black students
simply tend to do things together as any
other group might,”

When asked if he Ielt racial
separatism existed Pierce replied,
“How could there be” II blacks wanted
to enIorce separatism, Grinnell
