llestei' Street

Written and directed by Joan Micklin
Silver. Hester Street (91 mins.) iS the story
of a Russian Jew who comes to America
ahead oi his wile. He quickly becomes
assimilated and. in the process. enchanted
with another. more modern woman. How
the problem is resolved after his wife ar-
rives makes for a most humorous and
charming story.

In the larger sense. llester Street is the
story or all immigrants who passed
through the melting pot process and eXs
changed their old customs for new ones,

The L05 Angeles Times said. “It goes
beyond particulars to touch the whole
American immigrant experience."

price paid ior emigration and iuliillment

Jewish Strangers

Between 1890 and 1914 a massive wave of
Jewish immigration from Eastern Europe
hit America’s shores. This short (25
minute) film introduces Americans to the
JeWish experience'in the New World and to
life on the lower East Side of New York at
the turn-of—the-century. The many still pica
tures tell a story of the poverty, the suffer-
ing and exploitation as well as the en-
thusiasm. the religious commitment. the
enterprise and the ambition ot the early
settlers. No group made the transition
from proverty to success more rapidly
than they did, But not without great effort
and sacrifice.

The end of the film presents a come
parison between lower East Side turnofs
thecentury Jewish migrants and the
blacks who live here today. The come
parison is useful. but perhaps not always
{air to either group. Thursday, Sept. 19. at
