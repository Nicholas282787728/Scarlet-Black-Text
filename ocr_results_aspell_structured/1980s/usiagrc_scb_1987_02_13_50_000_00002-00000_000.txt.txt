Grinnell Health Care Compared

by Jennifer Halcrow
It is the “college’s responsibility that
adequate health care is provided in the
community, If it’s not, then it should be
provided by the college . . but it has to be
a combination ot resources,” according to
dean of Student. Affairs Jim Tederman.
There is a growing feeling on campus
among students and iaculty that specialin
ed care, such as services provided by a
gynecologist, is part of the college’s
responsibility and necusary for the ade
quate health care 01 the students. Deborah
Hirshiield, visiting instructor in history,
said the women's health care issue “con-
cerns me a great deal here because if a
student isn‘t aware lot a problem] or if it is
misdiagnosed. it‘s very dangerous . . , .
Hirshfield said she “wasn’t aware of
what the health care was like here . , l . I
assumed it would be the same as at
Douglas and Irvine [institutions attended
Hirshiield]. given the caliber of the other
services . . . . l was appalled at the lack ol
women's health care in particular, but also
bythe lack of health care in Grinnell.” Hir-
shiield admitted, however, that she had
not lived in a small town before now.
Grinnell is not poorly provided with
health care; however, a comparison of
Grinnell's health services with those of
other colleges in the American Colleges of
the Midwest (ACM), shows that Grinnell
ranks fairly low. The most extensive ser»
Vices are offered by Beottcher Health and
Counseling Center at Colorado College in

more man twice the budget allotted to
Grinnell’s health center. Dr. Judith
Reynolds is the resident physician who
supervises the Colorado center‘s staff of 20
professionals, including two nurse practir
tioners, in addition to student workers and
volunteers. The health center has two
laboratories and does all its own lab work
except for “me more complicated blood
work," according to Reynolds. All the ser-
vices provided by the cenver, which in
clude pelvic exams and pap smears, are
tree at charge. Female patients are also
provided with a tree threemonth supply of
birth control pills, if they choose to use
them. All these facilities are available to
the 1900 students who attend Colorado Cola
lege. Comprehensive fees for this year
were $10,615,

The only college surveyed that oiiers
fewer health services than Grinnell is
Lawrence University in Appleton, Wiscon-
sin. There, students pay on a perrvisit
basis. Four doctors from the area rotate
and visit the health center {or one hour 5
days a week. Students pay so lor each visit
with a doctor and pay tor all medication,
albeit at a reduced rate. Unlike Grirmell,
Appleton has 65,000 residents and, conse-
quently. students have access to a variety
of doctors, including the gynecologists. In
1955. 1028 full-time students attended
Lawrence for a comprehensive yearly lee

 

 

According to Jim Tederman. dean of
Student Afiairs, “Grinnell has made
choices to provide fairly minimal health
care. Students” and their families are
responsible for the rest." Although
satisfied with the Current care provided by
the health center, Tederman was positive
about working with the Central Iowa
Family Planning clinic of Marshalltown.
Tederman said, “Personally, i think , , .
the most attractive solution" is a satellite
clinic in Grinnell, Whether the college will
help the clinic [ind space in Grinnell, so
that townspeople as well as students could
use the lacility, is “something the college
would have to explore before we would
know,” according to Tederman.

SGA
Notes

I) The Election Board Chair, Annette
Brown, submitted a by-law for the con-
stitution concerning rules for future elec—
tions In addition to some more minor
issues it stipulates that candidates for
president and vice-president must be
second-semester sophomores who are not
on academic or conduct probation and that
there can be no campaigning in the Post
Oliice on the day of the elections. After
some debate, a clause stating that all
writeein votes are invalid in runoff elec-
tions was struck from the by law. In this
iorm, it passed, but because it is an
amendment to the constitution. it must be
voted again at the next SGA meeting.

2) An amendment sponsored by Annette
Brown and Greg Evans was voted on, It re-
quired SGA Senators to attend two fifteen-
minute sessions with the cabinet member
ol their choice. This was intended to
familiarize the senators with the cabinet
members and the lnner~worklng of the
SGA. After the clause which made attenr
dance to the meeu'ngs mandatory was
struck, me bill passed unanimously.

3) Thom Barthelmas, soc1al coordinator,
said that organizers of the FOG last are
accepting recommendations about to
which charity the money which is raised
ought to be donated.
