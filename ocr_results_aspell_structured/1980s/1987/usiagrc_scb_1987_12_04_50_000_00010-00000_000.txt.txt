characteristic that I expect we will
see a lot in the luture: good team
defense. 0n offense the Pioneers

and experience allowed them to

Nighthawks
Finish First

Semester with
Winning Record

by J. Peter Rubin

With half the season over, the
Grinnell Nighthawks finish off this
semester’s action with a record of
3-2-1. Eight games remain to be
played next semester, and the
team looks forward to carrying its
winning record into the last part of
the season. Hopes are high among
the Nighthawks for a firstrcver
shot at the league playoffs.

Toprranked Loras defeated Grin-
nell on November is. The two goals
scored by Bryan Coughlin and
John Ekey were insignificant in
the wake of Loras's crashing of-
fense. which outshot Grinnell four
to one. By the time the final buzzer
rang. the Nighthawks had suffered
a 10-2 loss.

Grinnell was quick to recover
from this discouraging match,
chalking up a victory over Illinois
State University two days later on
November 20. The Nighthawks
were relentless in their shooting
and forechecking, pounding Il-
linois State with the same
l’ierceness that Loras had shown
them. Tempers tiared during the
game, as reflected by to penalties,
Matt Arnold scored the first goal
three-and-ahall minutes into the
first period, setting the stage for
the resulting 1073 win, Dennis
Gerhardstein and Bryan Coughlin
each scored a point, while
freshman superstar Mike Jennings
knocked in an unparalleled seven
goals. Jennings is the Nighthawks
most-treasured acquisition this
season, along with stamina, skill,
and a winning attitude that has
been very instrumental in the
team’s success.

The Nighthawks faced off
against lllinois state again the
following evening, November 21, in
what proved to be the closest game
this season. Grinnell played with a
skeleton crew of six (therefore,
without .substitutions) while Ilr
linois State fielded a full squad of
eighteen. An early goal by Geoff
Larson gave the Nighthawks a 1-0
lead at the end of the first period
and the incentive ho conserve their
energy and keep a steady pace,

Another goal by Larson in the se-
cond period gave Grinnell a 2o
lead, but Illinois State managed tr
slip the puck past goalkeeper Davii
Shane before the period ended.
Defenseman John Ekey motored
through enemy territory to score a
most impressive singlehander‘
goal to give Grinnell a 3-1 advan
tage at the start of the third period

An
Apology

Editor's note: The Scarlet and
Black had planned to run a com-
prehensive article about Coach
John Martinek-s resignation and
recent meetings between the foot
ball players and members of the
administration. Two reporters
were assigned to the story. For
reasons beyond our control, the are
ticle was not completed this week
We express our sincere regrets and
plan to cover these events next
semester.

On the
Schneid

by Eric D. Schneider

For sports fans across the na
tion, the month of December is
characterized by the dominance of
college athletics on the airwaves.
In December, the college football
bowl season arrives in all its glory.
The Bluebonnet Bowl, the Peach
Bowl. the independence Bowl, and
a host of other bowl games make
the overrsaturated sports fan sick
enough to retreat to the toilet bowl.
Also in December, college basket
ball Jams the airwaves in earnest.
With the arrival of the college
basketball season come the voices
of Al McGurre, Billy Packer, and
Dick Vitale. shattering the sound
barrier and spewing their nuggets
of knowledge for all who can hear.
it it weren‘t for college athletics,
ABC, CBS, NBC, and ESPN would
be forced to show more of the Pro
Bowling Tour, a sight which would
seriously dampen the spirit ot the
holiday season The networks pre
sent college athletics as consisting
of great athletes who amazingly
are students at the Same time Yet
the fact is that the College athletics
shown on television are played by
athletes masquerading as college ,
Students.

By creating through their lenses
hie unique atmosphere of col
legiate athletics, the networks cons
stantly remind the viewers that
they are watching a college
athletic event rather than a profes-
sional event, One technique used to
create atmosphere is the use of
sophomoric camera shots which
look up the cheerleaders' skirtsv
Other atmosphere shots include
the frequent panning of ther
Hawaiian-shirtrclad crowd
senselessly high-living each other,
and the shots of the wacky college
pep bands, playing the strands of
the Blues Brothers theme for th
umpteenth time, And what would
halftime be without the Sosecond‘
commericals extolling the],
