it is a typical Saturday at Kins
drcd House, a shelter tor the
homeless in Des Moines, and a cou~
ple oi carloads oi Grinnell students
irom Students Helping the
Homeless arrive to help do minor
repairs it is a sunny, breezy day,
the kind that makes people want to
be outside, and the residents oi
Kindred House are no exception.
They are busy tearing down the old
porch rooi, reading old papers
backs. or just walking around,
greeting the students with a non
committal “How ya doin'?”

No oi the stari oi Kindred
House, Greg Jones and Bill
Newton, are more diiiicult to track
down. Though iriendly, they are in
tent on getting things accomplish
ed at the house and are constantly
involved in one project or another.
Once a conversation gets started
about the house, however, Jones
and Newton have time to talk.
They have plenty to say about
homelessness in America and what
Kindred House is all about.

On September so, 1966, The
Scarlet and Black reported that
there was a new dress code in el-
[ect for the Quadrangle dining hall
It was decided that women could
wear Shorts or slacks and that men
could wear shorts at some
mealtimes. The new dress code
was only in effect for lunch and
late dinner on weekdays. The Saga
iood service requested that the
change be temporary to see
whether or not it affected atten-
dance at mealtimes. Aller several
days, no change was noticed. .

An editorial Commented on the
plight oi the Saga waitresses and
busboys who worked in the dining
halls, These employees were ex-
peeled to serve five tables
simultaneously and received a
whopping 5 as an hour. The Scarlet
and Black suggested that each stus
dent tip the waitress a nickel, thus
more than doubling her wages

The Grinnell chapter of the Air
Force Reserve oiiiccr Training
Corps spent the weck painting
street numbers on the curbs ln
lront of all 2000 Grinnell homes.
This was done as a volunteer
communitysservice project,
although the Arnorc did accept
donations

in Des Moines. however, he decide
ed to settle there and help iound
what is now Kindrcd House.

Jones speaks oi homelessness
irom experience, “I was
homeless,” he said, “I could have
stayed with relatives, but i went to
the shelter by choice, And the
reason 1help now is that i did live
in the shelters and, it was really
depressing 1 don't think shelters
can make it [the homeless pro-
bleml better, but they can ease the

am."

According to Jones, the
homeless problem is a complex
one. “We’re [Kindred House] do-
ing the job some state or govern-
ment agency should be doing. 1
think that could be had because
then they think they don't have to
do it, 1 used to think soup kitchens
and shelters were the way, but not
now." He says part oi the problem
stems irom the stereotype oi a
homeless person. “It‘s a guy with a
scraggly beard and a cigar stub,
with holes in his shoes and a wine
bottle. 1t iits some, but that par-
ticular stereotype doesn't repre
sent the majority oi the homeless,
like little kids or mothers. And
there are younger dudes who do
want to work. I see them come to
Des Moines to look tor a job and 1
see them leave ior somewhere else
it they can't iind a job. Also, one-

third oi the homeless are mentally
handicapped They are the hardest
to take care oi and some shelters
don't even take them, when they
need help the most."

Newton is a local Des Moines
resident who became homeless
iive years ago “when my woman
threw me out. 1 just decided to
move out and be a hobo, I didn’t
have trouble getting a job, I Just
said the hell with home." Over the
years, he has lived in Mexico, as
well as in various parts oi the
United States.

Six months ago, Newton came to
Kindred House and became the
house cook. ”I'm dedicated to the
community here. And I‘ve been
around winos tor a while and i
wanted to help them. 1 stayed with
them. i know how it is." He, too,
has a view at the homeless dil‘e
terent irom the common
stereotype. “The majority are
looking ior jobs, and we can get
them jobs and they can leave,"
said Newton.

Kindred House

Kindred House, unlike any other
house in Des Moines, does not
charge guests to stay there For
Jones and Newton, this is the only
way a house should be run.
“Places like Bethel [a shelter that
charges guests lbur dollars a day]
turned me against the other

students living in Smith Hall stole
Cornell College's victory bell. They
leit the college at 1:30 PM. Sunday

4 AM They then proceeded to cut
the chain to the gate oi the iootball
iield. They unbolted and drove oii

to paint it red and black on one

On September 27. 1957, the
Scarlet and Black reported that the
Board of Trustees approved the
plans ior a new library building
which was to be constructed in the
general area oi the proposed Fine
Arts Center The building. design
ed by Walter A, Notch, originally
was supposed t have lour glass
walls. but the design was changed
so lhat two of the walls would be
gray brick. The change was made
in order to save $200,000 The
building originall) was designed to

hold 300,000 books, but an ad
ministrative area was added to the
basement and this reduced the
library's capacity to zoo,ooo books.
In addition to the ofﬁces to be move
ed from the old administration
building, the administrative center
was to hold the oiiices oi admission
and possibly the oiiices oi develop-
ment and alumni aiiairs. The oi-
iices had to be moved out oi the old
administration building because it
was to be torn down in order to
build the Fine Arts building,

people out. That‘s wrong. We don't
do that here. Bethel Mission is sup»
posed to be a rescue mission. It‘s
more like a prison,” said Newton.

Kindred House is run solely
through donations, but Newton
says it is doing line. “The house
has come a long way. 1i we can
keep the city oii our butt, we'll be
ready ior winter, but we'll need all
the contributions we can get. Right
now we're trying to get everything
ready ior cold weather: the iloor.

irom crinnell have really been
helping,"

According to Jones, the
homeless problem “has gotten bet-
ter. and it's gotten worse, Now peo-
ple are aware that it is a problem,
even though the government tries
to say it isn't. The people ot this
country really are kind and com-
passionate, but they’ve been lied
to. The government likes to play
the numbers game and say there
are 10,000 homeless in a city when
there are really 100,000."

results from the tact that ”because
oi technology, their iields are no
longer around. This is 1987, and
what they did was 1967." The main
reason ior homelessness, Jones
believes, is “capitalism. Homeless
people don't iit ' . This is like a
throwaway society, and we tend to
do people the same way. 1i people
don't look like they have any more
value, we throw them away, when
they do have some value leit, ii so-
meone just gives them a chance.
Some homeless people do think
that this is it ior them. They've
been broken by society. That's the
worst right there, when you ]ust
destroy a person." Jones looks ior
an answer in education or re

we need to get someone like you
