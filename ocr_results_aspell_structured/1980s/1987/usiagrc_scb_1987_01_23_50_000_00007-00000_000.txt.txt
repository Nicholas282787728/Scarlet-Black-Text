student frustrated over poor

library security

Dear Editor}

I have never really felt that Grinnell Col-
lege would need great amounts of security
measures in the library, I have always felt
more tiian safe leaving coat, books,
backpack, et cetera, on shelves or carrols.
Don’t our library's hooks, then, deserve
the same consideration?

After discussing a paper topic with a
professor, I was terribly excited about
researching and writing my paper; he was
as enthusiastic about the topic as i was. By
sheer coincidence, every book I wanted to
use was not on the shelf. After going
through a frustrating five minutes at the
desk, I came to find out that the main book
i wished to base my paper on was “not on
record," which means either Someone ate
it. or dropped it, or chose to add it to their

personal library. This didn't merely annoy
me, but severely frustrated and saddened
me. I would hate to have an electronic
security system in Burling, but at the
same time, i would like to begin my
research paper.

This has definitely been a problem for
many of us. What is the solution? Can’t we
respect the idea of openness and honesty
mat have in me past made Grinnell a
fresher place to live? is it not possible to
act with consideration for fellow students?
I know that my one letter will not end this
problem, but I do hope it will inspire the
people who have die books I wish to use to
return them to the library. Thank you. —

GOVERNOR'S HIGHWAY SAFETV OFFICE

“My fellow Grinnellians...We have suf-
fered a great loss, Our President has been
stricken by la low grade, earned in his
dedication to serving us, his people, inow
stand in his postion. i pledge to continue
his policies..."

A funny thing happened to me over
break. A Psychology professor gave me a
promotion. i learned of this promotion via
Ted Amann, our illustrious SGA president,
now our illustrious eXrSGA President You
see, the SGA Constitution forbids anyone
from holding office in SGA who is on
academic, or any other. probation. And
this professor gave Ted a grade that put
him on probation, and out of SGA. My
opening paragraph is a speech most vice-
presidents would love to give, though they
would try to appear somber. Finally,
something important to do! No more
funerals!

“Compare Ted and me...

Ted wed/rs strange hats
and clothes. I wear

turtleneck shirts with

corduroy pants. Ted got
alcohol into the dining

halls. I got faculty
members into the

dining halls."

The vicerpresient of the student govern
ment at Grinnell College, however, is not
like most vice-presidents. In spite of the
implication of the name, our VP is nota do-
nothing postion. subordinate to the presi»
dent indeed. the jobs of preSident and
vice-president are so different that the pos-
tions traditionally have attracted very difr
ferent types of people, This year’s ad
ministration is a perfect example Com-
pare Tcd and me. Ted eats mushrooms. I
eat celery sticks Ted wears strange hats
and clothes, I wear turtleneck shirts with
corduroy pants Ted likes the Grateful
Dead. I like...well. Cyndi Lauper? Our dif~
ieroiit personalities have translated into
different doings, .

Ted got alcohol Into the dining halls. I
got faculty members into the dining halls,
The point is that i ran lor vice-president
not because I wanted to be subordinate to
Ted, but because I was interested in the
separate duties of the vicepresident's job.

Essentially, I am the president of what
might be Called the Academic Wing of
SGA, an area completely separate from
the more familiar parl of SGA, the one that
Ted ran. that deals with student life. I am a
member of the Curriculum Commitlee,
chairman of the Student Colincil on Curr
riculum, and havc been involved In issues
such as proposals to incorporate pluses liir
to the Griiinell grading system: the sub
jects of internshi fin-s iid admission
policy, keeping . ribul n requirements
oiit of Grinnell. and looking for a viable

While Ted was Sitting on the Committee on

Student Life, trying to figure out alcohol
policy, 1 was on the Curriculum Commit-
tee, trying to figure out grading policy.
Both duties are important, but they are
clearly different, And it doesn’t seem to
make sense to have the vice-president,
whose personality and area of expertise
are very different from those of the presi-
dent, automaticaliy take on the duties of
the president in the event of a vacancy in
the higher office.

It I were to become president and take
over Ted's duties, SGA would not only
have lost its overall president, but also its
president for academic affairs. I would
lose Hie main reason I ran for office, The
students would lose a good representative
in academic affairs and gain a lessgood
representative for social affairs. What I
plan to do, then, is to take the title of presir
dent, as I am required to do, and carry out .
some of the ceremonial functions therein
implied. But as for substantive functions, I
will continue with my work in the cure
ricular areas and give the social and party
responsibilities to the new vice-president.
who will be elected on February 4. While
slightly unconstitutional lthe SGA Conv
stitution gives the VP curricular issues) I
think this solution would be in everyone's
interest.

For the longer term, i will propose an
SGA Constitutional Amendment that
would change the Vice-president's title to
the bureaucratically long, but descriptive-
ly proper, vicepresident of SGA/Presir
dent for Academic Affairs, (VP/FAA) In
the event of a vacancy in the president's
office the VP/PAA would become the
ceremonial president of son, chairing
some of the meetings he was iormerly just
a member of, while maintaining the job of
President for Academic Affairs. The new
