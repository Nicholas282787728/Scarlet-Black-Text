Study abroad includes
a study of people

by May-lee Chai

I was told that it would be more in-
terutmg if i stopped writing ”b'g
generalizations”.and was more speci c
about the French people. Well, it’s rather
difficult to get too speciiic about a culture
and a people that I have known for only a
couple of months. However, l can describe

some people that I have come to know and -

leave the analysis to the reader.

Michelle is of Breton and Irish descent,
universityceducated, a professional (she
works in an olfice). Typically Breton, she
is petite with high cheekbones and hair
that is dark walnut color with lighter, gold
highlights.

Her roots are deep in Rennes, genera-
tions, and her father a Well- known local
politician Once when l commented on how
Princess Stephanie of Manaco was at
tempting to sing in a video, she defended
her. She said, “It’s hard to try to make a
name for oneself, I know in my own way
what it is like to always be known as such
.and-such‘s daughter. That is how it is for
me sometimes.”

M chell, a so al t and daughter
at French politician.

Michelle is a socialiste. No, I’ve not turn-
ed my back on Reagan's America and
started fraternizing with the reds. Her
socialism is an intellectual thing, a point of
view, it seems to me, No revolutions here.

After I returned from winter break in
London. some people asked if i had a good
time, was London interesting. etc.
Michelle asked, “Did you see the misery in
the streets?”

Professor de la Robertie teaches the
class of Chinese I audit He is thin 35 ish,
sports a George Lucas beard and keeps his
brown hair cropped close on the sides,
creating a Mohawk of sorts I was told by
one of the students when I first came that
he is “sympa"—a.k.a. nice,

Taking a “real“ French class with

”real" french Students is a great cultural '

i- v swig-4r 'n w:

experience. Prof de la Robertie talks, we
write. Every other week there is a Conver-
saton class. He asks a question The
French students (I am the sole “enr
trangere ) grimace sigh, look through

Per Denis, the Santa Claus of the
history department.

- their notes, grimace, and check their notes

again, until someone iinally is sure enough
of what must be said to actually say
something in Chinese.

Prof de la Robertie says, “Non, that is
not completely right." And he corrects the
student.

I remember one girl biting her lips and
burying her head in her notebooks.

“This is a conversation class,” reminds
M. de la Robert'ie. “You must speak. Allele
y. Personne?”

No one speaks.

There are also the prots for us foreign
students. Profs here do not say things like
“let’s talk after class" or write things like
“see me” on papers. They talk in class.

“This is very badly written,” says
Madame H in front of everyone. “You
have made many errors." she pivots on
her spike heels, tossing back her perfectly
Culffed head of brownish and blondish hair
and picks up my paper that is so covered
with red it seems someone has bled all
over it. She begins to read all the com»
ments she has written.

Then there is Per Denis, a man shaped
like Santa Claus inside and out. His gray
hair is longish, haloclike around his shiny
bald top. He has an easy smile, a low

Interest group seeks
awareness of Native Americans

by Susan Front

The newly formed Native American Ins
terest Group of Grinnell (NAIG) is a group
of students who have come together to
learn more about the many different
aspects of Native American life,

The main purpose of NAIG is to educate
Grinnellians about various concerns
related to Native Americans, Through
films, hooks, periodicals and speakers, the
NAiG hopes to present something for
everyone.

“Our basic goal is to provide inlorma»
tion on Native American issues. to inform
ourselves and the campus in general,"
said John Beaver, Coorganizer of the
group,

Reservation conditions, politics, history,
and religion are just some of the issues
that are discussed. The group hopes to
have next semester's Rosenl‘ield Sym-
posium be on Native American issues,
such as rights, social conditions and
spirituality.

NAIG is also encouraging theiadmis-
slons department and the administration
to send Grinnell recruiters to more heavily
upulated Native American areas. At the

grandiather sort of voice. and kind eyes.

He teaches the Brittany history class,
Impassioned by phonology and lexr

igraphy, he dissects Breton sentences dur-

ing the two-hour course that linishes at 7
m.. long after the sun has set.

-- “There are many similar words in

'French, Breton, and Gaulois," he said and

Wrote examples In the middle he told us
about Mme de Sevigne who wrote letters
aobut her travels and how the world was

present time, the statistics on the percen-
tage of Native Americans attending Grin—
nell are probably highly inaccurate. Most
students of Native American heritage do
not report their cultural background in
surveys.

Most students to not consider
themselves to be "really” American Inc
dian. Therefore, it is hard to know just
what kind of representation the Native
Americans really have at Grinnell. At this
time, only two Grinnell students have
checked Native American as their
heritage on the student surveys.

it you are of Native American heritage
or are simply intersted in NAIG, there are
meetings held every Wednesday night at
7:30 pm, in the Human and Gay Resource
Centers. Currently, there are about 20
students who attend the meetings, not all
of whom are American Indians Everyone
there is interested in Native American
issues and eager to share information to
help others learn about these issues. For
more information please contact Matt
Moreland (x1727) or John Beaver (X1729),

petit back then and it took only 3000 Franks
to invade France and by the way “cur-
ragh" is a Breton word for boat...

So are these people “typical" examples,
you ask? Quel horreurl Out of respect for
those featured I must say “No!" After all,
to be French is to be an individual, n’estce
pas?
