Although the pleasant weather in Grin—
nell seems to be subsiding, both the
women’s and men’s indoor track teams
are warming up. After successful show»
ings last weekend at he South Division

Championships in Mount Vernon, in which .

both teams placed second to Cornell, the
Grinnell tracksters look forward to their
only home competition this Saturday.

The Grinnell Invitational will host a
“talented group of teams,” said Coach
Evelyn Freeman, “but i expect we Will do
fairly well,” Neither team is emphasizing
this meet, however, as they intend to
“train right through it in anticipation of
conference," according to Coach Will
Freeman. .

“We aren’t really Concerned with winnr
ing this meet. We’re still experimenting,
trying new combinations, We’ll field a
strong team, but not necessarily the
strongest one that we would field at cone
ference,” Freeman added.

In last weekend’s meet, the women's
team, although still not competing with
full ranks because of sickness and injuries,
was only 17 points behind Cornell's first
place effort of 152 points, Coe was a distant
third, scoring 42 points to Grinnell’s 135.
“Just about everyone on the team per-
formed very well," commented Freeman,
“1 was very pleased with the meet-almost
everyone placed.”

Grinnell’s women Swept the field events.
Chris Lawson won the long jump with a
16-0 3/. leap, Kim Kuncl the triple jump
with a 30—3 effort, Veronika Platzer the
shot put (401m and Abbey Green’s trio
mark made her victorious in the high
jump. Teammate Karen Drinkwater tied
for second in the high jump.

The sprinters also appeared dominating,
qualifying three to run in the final heat of
the 55m dash, in which Kuncl placed se-
cond (7.640), Lawson fourth (7.75) and

GO!

Debra Simon sixth (7.80). In the 500m
Kristin Richert had an excellent perfor-
mance, placing second with a time of
1:27.53, followed closely by Heidi Hopkins,
who took fourth (1:30.88).

Another 2nd/4th combination occurred
in the 300m in which Kunel and Lawson
turned in respective times of 45.62 and
46.13. Stina Winn, in a well-run race, plac-
ed first in the 1000111 to roundout Grinnell's
strong showing.

”What we are discovering about ﬂue
men’s team," commented Freeman in
relation to his team’s performance at Cor-
nell, “is that we are pretty solid down the
line with no glaring weaknesses.“ He con-
tinued by adding, “We didn’t have, really,
any outstanding performances per se; we
just exhibited a great deal at depth.”

Dave Wisdom, one of the many distance
runners who had good times, broke the
record he Set last Week in the 5000m with a
15:46.00 effort. Walt Maley “ran away”
with the 500m, securing first with his time
of 1:08.97. Dave Jones doubled for second
place in the long and triple jumps with
2041 ".1 and 39-5 marks, while Rob Parker
also captured a second place in the 400m
(51.87), missing first by just .01 seconds.

In the mile relay, which “may be the
race that decides conference," according
to Freeman, Grinnell’s Parker, Eric Ar-
nold, John Beaver and Maley ”beat the
teams they had to beat" to nail down first
place (3:37.82),

Both Freeman noted, “Our confidence
level is way up. We're training hard
physically and mentally, and it was great
to do well admidst such traditionally
powerful teams as Cornell, Cost and Mon-
mouth.” They realize, however. that their
teams are not as sharp as they must be for
conference, and so, they continue to hone
in preparation for the championships in
early March.
