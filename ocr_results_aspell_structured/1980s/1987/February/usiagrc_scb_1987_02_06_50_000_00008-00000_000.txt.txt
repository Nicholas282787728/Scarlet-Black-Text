BODY HEAT (1981) is one hot movie
Lawrence Kasdan, in his first directorial
role. succeeds perfectly in conveying the
steaming heat ofa Florida August onto the
screen so that his audience all but sweats
in sympathy. Using images and sounds or
persistent and intolerable heat (fans rattl-
ing, the sizzle of food frying, fire engines
wailing in the distance, the glare of heat
lamps), Kasdan pulls the Viewer right into
the film’s steaming, sultry atmosphere,
and into its intricate plot.

And whata plotl William Hurt plays Ned
Racine, a cop who becomes infatuated
with one Matty Walker (Kathleen Turner),
a classic ”femme fatale." She draws his
attention wiﬂi such irresistible lines as
“You’re not too smart. I like that ln a
man." Their quickly ensuing love affair is
complicated by Matty’s marriage to a
“small, weak man,” played by Richard
Crenna, Sool'rNed and Matty are scheming

to kill her husband, but what results is
much more complicated than mere
murder.

Director Kasdan also wrote the
screenplay. which is a wondrous composi-
tion of ambiguities. insinuations. and
sharp quips. Listen carelully for all the
underrthe~breath utterances; wurds are
occasionally drowned out by the wailing of
a saxophone. This difficulty in hearing the
dialogue is undoubtedly intended; it adds
to the sense of dark uncertainty.

In an interview soon after the film's
release, Kasdan explained. “I wanted this
film to have the intricate structure of a
dream, the density of a good novel. and the
texture of recognizable people in extraor~
dinary circumstances.“ It is unques-
tlonable that Kasdan’s first attempt at
directing is a sizzling success,

Cary Grant's Charm and sophistication

The ambiguous ending and the uncertain5

Magnificent Ambersons

by Kevin O’Prey

Orson Welles followed up his 1941 movie
triumph CITIZEN KANE with this adapter
tion of Booth Tarkington’s novel about the
decline of an American aristocracy. The
story revolves around the noble Amberson
iamily: the daughter, lsahel, the son-in~
law, Eugene, and their son, George. A
young lsabel gives up a relationship with a
commoner, Eugene Morgan, in order to
marry the more socially acceptable
William Minafer. Their son George turns
out to be a real monster (Little Lord
Fauntleroy with fangs), The local
townspeople long for the day when little
Georgie gets his just desserts. Their wait
is not in vain as Grandfather Amberson's
fortune collapses and the vain, arrogant
George is doomed, Before it is over,
however, George is able to ruin the
rekindled love between his now widowed
‘mother and her old suitor, Eugene.

THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS is a
film about moral decay and the passing of
an era. Although he ranks as one of the
greatest American directors, Orson Welles
was the quintessential outsider. Since he
was not the Hollywood establishment’s
type, he found directing and acting to be
extremely difficult in the U S, This film is
one with which Welles wasn't able to do all
he wanted,

Still, his genius runs thorughout THE
MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS. Like his
other films, the direction here is brilliant.
Although the plot wears thin at times and
is somewhat somber (but when has he
made a ‘happy’ film?), the outstanding
direction, production, and action make
THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS
worth the trip.
