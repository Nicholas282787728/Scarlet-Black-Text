Smashed

(or Butchering Japanese) ‘

by Lisa Grant

Using a ioreign language in the mother
country and learning it in the classroom
are two entirely different situations. This
is an assertion most students oi a foreign
language hear. but I'm iinally beginning to
appreciate what it means.

To become ﬂuent in Japanese. I write
letters. practice kanji. watch ex»
cruciatlngly boring videos designed to turn
the viewer on from Japanese iorever. I
learn grammar but applying grammar
rules to everyday speech is complicated. A
language has to be natural to be real and
natural usage comes only with practice
Grammar is a good springboard. but not
the end all tas my Japanese teachers seem
to thilikl.

Outside of the classroom. communica-
tion is the important goal and anything
goes as long as the idea gels across This
type. at thinking has led to some iiinny
habits.

Take Vocabulary for instance. I] I don't
know in corr‘ect word. I try to come up with

”Ambulance” becomes "hospital car’l
"wheel" becomes ”round thing”: "pave

tain”t and so did everyone else!

There are times. though when i just
can‘t describe something in two words. i
end up blithely sticking the English word
at the end oi my sentence. This doesn't
phase any of my iriends during a conver-
sation because they understand why I do
it, and, since they study eight years of
written English. they usually know the
words.

Because native speakers at any
language tend to‘mumble and slur and
speak fast, there are times when i miss the
point oi a conversation completely and
wind up saying something entirely on the
mark. or nothing at all,

Someone once asked me it I wanted a
piece oi American candy. i thought he was
asking about American rain and didn't
have the ioggiest idea about what to say!
Eventually. i got it straight. but conversa~
tions can go way all on a tangent as a
result of misunderstandings.

Even the most ccniidcnt person will
tumble and make mistakes. and the rear oi
being laughed at is enough to cripple el‘lecc
tlve usage. Slowly I lost my iear as the
realization dawned that native speakers
don't eal ioreigners who make language
mistakes,

Most Japanese are tolerant and they are

dating couples a great deal,

One female senior commented that “it’s
hard to date someone unless you're in a
serious relationship because the Communic
ty is so small that the relationship
escalates in others' minds as something
serious,”

Pickert lelt that it was unfortunate that
relationships at Grinnell seemed to be
marked with “the pervasive and general
aassumption that it will become sexual."
According to Camarena. “Both males
and females are here. growing up, trying
to become Comfortable with their own sex-
uality. It is impossible to be raised in
American Culture without feeling, or at
least seeing; sexual pressures.”
Disadvantages and drawbacks all cons
Sidered, dates are still made. Townere
Larsen and Camarena both pointed out,
wim regard to dating, that relationships
tend to form between two lriends in a
group who have similar interests and en
joy sharing time together.

Pickert adds, “Dating can make one feel

partner at Grinnell gives you confidence,
day by day, to move along."
