Our Final Words

This is the last isxue aflhe Scarlet and
Black for the academic year. Over the
last year, the Scarlet and Black has ex-
perienced an uncommon phenomenon
in that the paper's staff has remained
relatively stable with few cases of editor
"burn-out," In many ways, the stability
of the editorial ataff has enabled the
Scarlet and Black to improve the quali-
ty of in reporting. Yet, or stable and as
talented as the staff of the Scarlet and
Black ha. been this year, we have been
unable to cover fully many issues that
concern the campus because of utm-
cestary secrecy on behalf of both ad-
mitii'xlrators and faculty .

Thanks to those who “did”

something

To lhe Edilor.

Mitch Snyder asked for Grinncll
students to help the homeless ol Des
Memes. instead or just sitting around and
talking aboul ii. "Students Helping the
Homeless” actually DID do something
about il by going to Des Moines and work
mg at Kindred House every Saturday
aliernoon. We cl “Students Helping the
Homeless” would like to share with you
some at the things that we have ac-
complished.

First of all, we would like to thank
everyone who donated to the clothing drive
we held a couple of weeks ago, An incredi~
ble amount. of clothes, books. and various
items were generously donated, more than
we expected, in tact. it look us a truck and
a car It) haul all of the items in Des Moines
the following Saturday, and the entire day
lo sort it all out. Bul it was well worth it.
Everything given was greatly apr
proclaled!

Thanks also to all ot the people who gave
up their Saturdays to travel to Des Moines
in help out. We collected 300i) signatures
tor a petition urging the Des Moines city
council not to evict anyone trom the
homeless shelters run by Kindred House.
Also an initiative in support of the etlorts
of Kindred House was passed at Grinnell.
and the money tor the recent Fog Fast was
given to Kindred House.

It is, however. disappointing to think oi
how 1much more we could have ac

complished it all the people who signed up
it) help at our inst meeting would have
rcnlly committed lhemselves and helped
We had (in people Sign up to help On the
hrsi Saturday aboul 20 people went in Des
Maines — which vias‘great! Unfortunate
ly, the numbers kepl decreasing nll
sometimes only THREE people would
show up! ll was umazmg how many people
said they had homework to do on a Satur-
day Des homes may not sound all that
glamorous, but there are over 2000
homeless there who could really use our
helpl Too bad there isn't a symposium on
poverty every two weeks...

Right now the Kindred House Is in
negotiations with lhe city council over how
high the occupancy rate oi‘ the shelters
may be. People will most likely be evicted
because there is not the danger oi dying
from the cold. as there was this Winter.
Nexl [all we will Continue to work with the
homeless of Des Moines. We will be
needing all the help we can get with the
winter coming up. For lhe summer, two
Grinncll students will be Slaying at the
Kindred House to help out, Anyway, plan
on seeing more oi our signs around cam-
pus next year, and remember — the pro
blems of the homeless do not end when
classes do.

Thanks for your time. A Students Help-
