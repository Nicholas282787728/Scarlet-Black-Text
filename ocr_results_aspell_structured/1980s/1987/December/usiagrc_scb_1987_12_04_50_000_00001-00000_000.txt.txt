Homeless conference
probes stereotypes

by Bruce Emond

“Those who are without homes
vary in age, race, sex, religion,
and background as much as
anyone else. Where they do not
vary is in their address, because
they have none.” With these
words. Grinnell senior David
Laewensteiri opened last
Tuesday’s unenday Conference on
the Right to Shelter,

The conierence was conducted
by several Grinnell students in-
volved in working with the
homeless in Des Moines, Patty
MacDonell oi the Kindred Com-
munity in Des Moines, and Pam
Carmichael, president of the iowa
Coalition tor the Homeless.
Although the aiternoon panel
discussion was wellrattended, only
15 students, eight of whom had
been explicitly invited to the
presentation
Doneil s and Carmichael s lecture

The conierence was the culminar
tion of eitorts by Students Helping
the Homeless (SHH) to educate the
Grinnell population about the
plight oi the homeless

SHH was iounded last February
when Mitch Snyder. a represen-
tative of the Washington-based
Community tor Creative Nona
Violence, spoke at the college and
dared students to coniront the
issues of poverty and
homelessness Unlike so many
cases in which the initial ens
thusiasm and good intentions wane
as academic pressure intensities,
Loewenstcin and others decided to
act on Snyder's dare, Stirred by
Snyder’s mention oi the imminent
closure oi two Des Moines
homeless shelters,
iounded SHH.

Loewenstein had always been in
terested in the homeless, but he
said Snyder’s speech gave him the
motivation to participate actively
in helping them. He said his aim
was to have students encounter

homelessness directly, to have
them see it as a real and pressing
problem in their communities, not
one distant irom their lives

”Doing something like this is so
diiierent than. say, tundraising,”
said Loewenstein, “With fundraisr
ing, you can’t put a race to the
name and the problem is not as
real. li you get people to go and see
[the homeless], it may change
their minds ”

Loewenstein remembers one
particularly aiiectiog moment
during Snyder's speech. ”He said
that it you saw a house burning
down and it had your iamily or
iriends in it. then you'd risk your
lite to save them. Mitch added that
the homeless shelters were ‘bui‘nr
ing down' in Des Moines,” said
Loewenstein.

Loewenstein, along with iellow
coordinators Debbie Gottschalk
and Karen Lehman and volunteer
Amy Tague. hopes that SHH will
help to eradicate the stereotypes of

the homeless and the viewing or
the homeless as different from
everyone else. “It's very impor
tant to first overcome the
stereotypes oi homeless people by
seeing that they are not all the
same type oi person.,,,but more
important than that is to see them
as individuals,” stated sophomore
Lehman. ,

Job and educational oppor-
tunities are often off-limits to the
homeless, Tague recounted the
case at a ls-yearold, Erin, whose
iamily had lost their apartment in
a fire Although she was an
outstanding student in high school.
there was the likelihood that Erin
would have to give up her own
aspirations in order to support her
mother and siblings. “I look
around me here and realize that
this woman has more intelligence,
more speaking ability. more

Scarlet and Black interview

Afghan resistance movement explored

Grinnell freshman was Afghan freedom fighter

by May-lee Chai

To most students here in Grin-
nell, Iowa, whose major concerns
right now center around iinal exr
amS and that end—oi-thesemester
paper, the Aighan struggle against
the Soviet Union is little more than
a distant evil. However, for one
Grinnell ireshman, it is a problem
that Cannot be ignored.

Syed Ahmad Amiry, a native or
Logar province in Aignanistan,
iought with the Afghan ireedom
fighters, or mujahedin, for two»
and-a-half years. His brothers cons
tinue to tight with the rnujahedin
and his lather is actively working
to distribute international aid to
fighters and Aighan refugees in
Pakistan.

In an interview with the Scarlet
and Black, Amiry detailed his in
volvement with the ireedom
fighters and explained some of the
problems racing his country.

Scarlet and Black:
what was your role in the Afghan
resistance movement?

Amity:

l was a ireedom fighter aiter
1984 when I graduated from high
school and I immigrated to
Pakistan, So after that, I was a
ireedom tighter and iighting
against the Soviets in Afghanistan.

Scarlet and Black:
How long were you in the move
ment?

Amiry:
For two-andrarhalf years. i
wasn’t consistently. i would come
to Pakistan during the winter and
go to Aighanistan during the sum-
mer,
Scarlet and Black:
How did you get involved?

Amiry:

Because most oi the people oi
Aighanistan just don't like the
Soviets and we, my iamily, chose
to immigrate to Pakistan because
we didn’t like that government, the
Soviet-backed government. And
that is why we decided to fight the
Soviets. We wanted the Soviets out
oi Aighanistan.

Scarlet and Black:

How did you connect with the
people in the resistance move
ment’! Through friends? Had peo
ple you knew in school been involv-
ed?

itiiiiry;

Well, actually, my iamily was
living in the countryside so we had
two houses. one in Kabul [the
capital], one in Logar. So at the
same time i was in high school. we

had connected with the Mujahedin
in our area. Ninety percent of the
people in Afghanistan are now
ireedom tighters,

Scarlet and Black:
So it’s not difficult to get involv-
ed?

Amiry:
It's not really diiiicult. Yeah.

Scarlet and Black:

What did you do in the movement
as a ireedom lighter? Did you iight
as a soldier or did you work in in»
telligence?

iiiiiiry:
it’s not like the military. We
Can’t use the term “Soldier” there,
We just do it willingly. .. There is
nobody to tell us to do that. So i was
