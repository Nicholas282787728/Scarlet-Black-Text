How Sweet
It Was

by Walt Maley

indeed, it was pretty sweet
Saturday out on hosenbloom held
in the moments that iollowed the
dramatic rally and victory tor the
Grinnell College Pioneer football
team. This was more than an ex
citing win tor a team on a crisp
iootballgame day in November.
What occurred on what turned out
to be a near-periect day tor a game
was truly a great story.

As those oi you who follow the
team know. this has been a season
oi irustration and near futility tor
the Pioneers, For many reasons,
the Pioneers have been put in the
position of underdog week aiter
week In my estimation, Saturday
was not much different Illinois
College could have been iavored to
win this game: they had a better
record and they had more players.
My point is, it would have been
very easy for a lot oi teams lo/lay
down and accept a season oi no
wins and say, “Oh well, that is
what is supposed to happen." The
Pioneers said no. They went out on
the iield Saturday and took the
light to the Blue Boys of lllinois
College tor 50 minutes oi hard-
fought football. and when the game
was over and the smoke had
cleared, Grinnell's football team
had emerged the victor.

Grinnell opened the scoring with
a toplay 85-yard march in the iirst
quarter. The tinal play in the series
was a 7~yard pass from QB Jim
\Veiand to split end Fred Hopkins,
Key pla s in the drive were Com»
pletio s trom Weiand to Craig
Whitaker for 20 and 29 yards. The
teams battled back and forth into
the second quarter until Illinois
scored on a long run, but iortunate
ly missed the point, the final
margin oi victory. Grinnell led at
the hall Hi.

in the third. it appeared that
Grinnell might take control of the
game when iullback Mick
MaCLean broke loose tor a seryard
iaunt up the middle (or a score.
Grinnell led at the end at the third
quarter 1475,

The lourth quarter brought rear

and trembling into the hearts of the
Pioneer tans and players alike as
Illinois College scored twice in the
span oi 1:24 to take a 20—14 lead.
The Blue Boys threatened to score
several more times but were con-

tinually turned away by the
Pioneer defense, 1n iact, one drive
was halted by an interception by
Mike Mohan in the end zone, Final»
ly. the oiiense got the ball back
with 4:44 leit in their season and
iound themselves 84 yards away
irom a win. Slowly but surely they
went to work grinding out the yarn
dage in a marathon 16 plays, Again
the golden arm oi Weiand pulled
out several key completions to
sophomore Rich Wilson, including
the iinal two plays’ a 19-yard pass
to the 9 and a diving catch at the
goal line tor the score.

The score was How 20720 and
kicker Mike Mohan was called
upon to deliver the extra point and
the victory to the Pioineers The
kick sailed straight and true and.
most importantly, through the goal
posts. Grinnell had won the game,

On deiense, many players had
great games, Bill Daoney seemed
to be in the opponents' backiield on
nearly every play in the second
quarter. He iinished with five-and-
a~half tackles including tworandsa-
halt sacks Rob Click had eight
tackles and Mike Anderson and
Scott Truesdell had sevenrand-a-
hall tackles each.

in oiiense. Mick MacLean led all
Grlnnell rushers with nine carried

Pioneers ground out 306 yards
rushing. Quarterback Jim Weiand
had nine completions ior 127 yards
and two touchdowns. Grinnell
outgained the Blue Boys 390 to 251,
thereby indicating their
dominance in the trenches, Speak
ing oi the trenches, l have

sive line consists oi tackles Henry
Vogelman and Scott Whipple,

and Paul Schneider, and center
Rob Burns.

Coach Martinek had these views
on the game: “All season we have
had to recycle irom losses and
come back to work all week, only
to be outmanned again on Satur-
day. This game we needed to win
and did win and the team showed
some real character in doing it "
Congratulations to’the team on
their iinal victory it was a
memorable way to end the season.
