FILMS WIS WEEK

Love and Death

by Vincent Prosscr

The plot of “Love and Death”
revolves around a condemned man
in ltii2 Russia reminiscing about
his life This Woody Allen film is
supposedly iniluenced by “War
and Peace,” iiigmar Bergman,
and s J. Perelman i suppose that
last inilucnce is seen in the literary
style oi the film's language and
allusions. and in the film‘s cynical
humor.

“Love and Death" can be seen as
a transitional Work for Allen. In
this ﬁlm, he exhibits some of the
slapstick oi his earlier work but in»
troduces two new, more serious

strains: the interest in the
unreason and chance that
underline love, and the interest in
rcveric and pastoralism Thesc
threads. appearing more obviously
in “Annie Hall," have been con-
tinued and strengthened in his re
cent iilms. in “Love and Death,"
the Russian or Chekhovian strain
succeeds because Allen does not
take himseli too seriously, while
his most recent tilm, “Radio
Days," sinks beneath the weight oi
its own pretension and Chekhovian
derivation

To some extent, the end oi "Love

and Death" is similarly unsuc
cessiul, not matching in tone the
rest oi the Iilm. Still, its transcen-
dent imagery gives us a statement
on liic that is, tinally, a pei-iect
work of Vailitils. Whether you
pi-eier that aspect oi Allen's work.
or his butioonery and lampoons on
intellectual posturing, you will iind
something to emoy in this iilm.

The Gold Rush

by Thomas Beverly

”In the creation of comedy, it is
paradoxical that tragedy
stimulates the spirit at ridicule;
because ridicule, i suppose, is an
attitude of defiance' we must
laugh in the iace oi our
helplessness against the iorces oi
nature —- or go insane," This is
how Charlie Chaplin. in his
autobiography, explains the
curious inspiration oi “The Gold
Rush" e the tragedy oi the Donner
Party.

The story is oi a hardrluck proe
spector who goes to Alaska in
hopes of improving his iortune.
Once there, he experiences goldr
digging, avalanches, outlaws, stare
vation, romance, and eventually
success.

"The Gold Rush” is by Iar the
most popular or Chaplin's feature
length iilms, and it contains many

Image Before
My Eyes

by Georgia Dentel

Poland beiore its destruction
was the most important center oi
Jewish culture and creativity in
the world. Through rare iilms,
photographs, music, and inter-
views with survivors oi this lost
culture, “Image Reiore My Eyes" _

oi his best-known clips This is the
iilm in which he and his compa-
nions dine elegantly 7 on one of
Charlie's shoes. Also included are
the tilting-cabin»on»a»clil’i scene
and the uniorgettable “dance oi
the rolls." As usual, the iilm was
shot without any kind oi detailed
script, ivith many oi the most
hilarious gags created sponr
taneously Chaplin’s nun-verbal
expression is so superb that soon
one iorgets that this is, aiter all, a
silent movie. Georgia Hale is
wonderiul as the spirited dance-
hall girl who quickly becomes the
object oi Chaplin’s airection, Mack
Swain is also excellent as Big Jim,
Charlie’s prospecting partner (and
straight man), who must tind
Chaplin in order to regain his
claim.

"The Gold Rush” premiered at

the Strand Theatre in New York on
August is, 1925 to a highly enr
thusiastic audience and went on to
gross over iive million dollars that
year. Now over 60 years old. the
iilm is still as iunny as itever must
have been, and its subtle commene
tary on man's greed is as timely
now as then Chaplin himseli knew
it was his iinest work, stating that
it was “the picture I want to be
remembered by." ii you have love
ed Chaplin ior years, or have never
experienced his genius ior
yourseli, or simply want to see one
oi the iinest iilms ever made.
make sure you catch "The Gold
Rush" this weekend.
