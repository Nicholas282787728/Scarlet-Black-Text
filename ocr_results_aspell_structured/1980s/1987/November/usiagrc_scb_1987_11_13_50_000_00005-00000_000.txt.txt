The Democratic
Party is decadent

and depraved

i was sitting in a room with eight
thousand other people. The lights
were out, and we sat there, our
mouths hanging open, staring at
the giant face that Spoke down at
us lrorn a hovering screen. it was
the grotesque face of Tom Miller.
Iowa’s Attorney General, and it
was saying, "Keep democracy
fit," or "feed your head" as

Bob Fein

something like that I was in no
mood ior this, That attorney
general iace was looking like the
head oi a tyrannosourus rex with a
styroioam wig and Mr. Potato
Head ears. ”Change the channel."
Iwhined, but nobody heard.

At least, nobody but Paula
Briggs and Kirsten Pullen, who
were sitting with me at the
Democratic Party's Jeffersonr
Jackson fundraising dinner in Des
Moines last Saturday night. What
had begun ior me on the pretense
of political consciousness had 510w,
1y metamorphosed into a quest ior
unconsciousness, a bizarre
marathon of fanatical selfaahuse.
For six hours already, the three of

‘us had been immersed in the
Democratic sinkhole oi iniamy and
vice, this vain and wild parade oi
promiscuity, drunkenness.
thievery. whoredom and obsessive
political mania ‘

This host of evils had engulfed
Des Moines, transiorming it ens
tirely into a political circus The
Whole place had been festooned
with obnoxious posters and was
now populated with roving gangs
oi security men (Wires coming out
of their ears) and hordes of
possessed Hawkeyes in political
drag

The attorney general head was
gone now, replaced by an even
more grotesque Paul Simon head,
talking to bore the balls offa brass
monkey. Vague memories or the
aiternoon waited through my clog-
ged consciousness: Paula and I
had met at the opulent Babbitt rala
ly, held in the atrium ot a
downtown oiiice building. where
we herded free food and beer and
got our hands on some tickets ior
the evening iestivities, We heard
that Babbitt was about to arrive,
and not wanting to be seen in the
company oi a coniessed pothead,
took 0” (or the Jesse Jackson ral-
ly.

Jackson's rally, though, looked
like the ﬁrst meeting oi some
deranged Rotary Club. About two
dozen people stood around in the
barren Malverno Room at the Best
Western. making lazy trips to the
stale cheese and crackers, Al Al
Gore's rally, it was rumored, they
were handing out tree Jack
Daniels. But Jackson, with his
skimpy cash bar, had already lost
my vote

We ditched the Jackson rally and
the depressing Malverno Room
and headed toward the Center of
political gravity: the hunt lawn oi
Veterans Memorial Auditorium,
where the rich campaigns had pit-

ched huge tents, Here was a dense
sca oi Hawkeye Democrats: old
men in pinstriped suits licking can~
died apples. young mousscshaired
campaign managers in suspenders
and tight little bow ties, Grin-
nellians in makeup, a pathetic Una
cle Sam, women wearing
styroioam hats and too much
lipstick 7 all staggering around to
steamy Dixieland jazz, courtesy oi
the Dukakis campaign

The scene verged on a euphoric
not when Dan Rather was spotted
inside a tight huddle oi cameras,
trying to wrestle candidate Paul
Simon into an interview Simon
panicked and fled toward his limo
with Rather in pursuit, and we
followed, holding sagging plates of
baked beans and cups oi Pabst
mue Ribbon, in a irenzy, the
crowd trampled careiully pruned
bushes to surge at the cameras.
newsmen trampled innocent
bystanders, and l trampled Uncle
Sam, who was slobbering all over
Thomas Jefferson.

At some point 7 it gets a little
hazy 7 we apparently decided to
plunge into the vortex oi all this
madness. into the belly of the
whole orgiastrc iinancial iiasco,
the Veterans' Auditorium itself

We moved like cattle up the
ramps and into the mammoth
auditorium, where sideburned
multitudes packed the free seats of
the raised grandstands, screaming
the name of the candidate of choice
and gyrating, signs raised.
Mousse-haired campaign
managers. coordinating this whole
apocalyptic vision, spoke into
bullhorns, exhorting us to do "the
wave," to gyrate and frolic. Below
us, on the floor of the auditorium,
greysuited thousands sat at long
tables and consumed the mass
produced dinner they had paid 350
for.

A plump old woman wearing a
styroioam hat with a Dukakis
sticker on it darted into our aisle
and leaped onto Kirsten, embrac-
ing her in a giant bear hug.
Kirsten’s eyes bugged out oi her
head. The woman shrieked, “I just
LUV you! I just LUUUUV your
smile!" By this time, though, we
were ireak-prooi We could not be
fazed.

To our leit sat a man wearing a
sticker that read HELLO MY
NAME is EARL. He kept making
inane jokes about the candidates.
especially Bruce Babbitt, and
would laugh high and quick like a
machine gun: hahahahahaha. He
read a sign: “Children believe in
Babbitt, huh? Hell, children
believe in RRRRABBITS, TOO!"
he roared, and laughed his high.
quick, machineagun laugh:
Hahahahaha, He opened Wide
enough ior me to see that he had no
teeth.

No more talking heads. I left the
stands and pushed my way through
a tunnel into one oi the long inner
corridors, looking ior a purer kind
oi depravity, Here, dozens oi
styroioam hats milled around in
puddles Outside the bathrooms, lin-
ed up at snack counters and disap
peared down ramps, somehow
leaving the auditorium. Where are

Victim of political booze cruise

Like many other students on this
campus. I attended the Jeiierson
Jackson dinner held in Des Moines
last Saturday I went because i
thought it would be an educational
:xperience And so it turned out to

e

The Jeiierson Jackson dinner

was sponsored by the Democrats

Barbara Brown

The remaining SIX Democratic
Presidential candidates were in
vited to Des Moines to speak at
Veteran's Auditorium, and people
could hear their speeches by buya
ing tickets to this dinner at $50 a
pop. The auditorium also has a
large balcony section. and the can
didates reserved space, in these
sections ior their other supporters

I found out about the dinner the
Thursday previous to the event.
The Des Moines coordinator for the
Babbitt campaign gave mea call 1
was told that their campaign had
bought balcony tickets so that
students ’could attend. They would
provide transportation by bus tor
anyone who would like to go, and
although we would not be eating
the $50»a~shot dinner, there would
be some food there for us, It should
be a lot of fun. I was told, and they
would have a keg on the bus.

Though I'm not committed to
any candidate at this point, I do
like some better than others. I
wanted to go to the dinner, but I did
not want to go on the Babbitt bus,
So 1 arranged to go on the Dukakis
bus. They did not have a keg, just a
iew twelve-packs.

The bus ride to Des Moines was
interesting, Besides the beer. there
were munchies and soit drinks,
and lots oi people who were not
really Sure why they were going to
Des Moines, We asked around, but

tells all

nobody was quite sure what we
were going to be doing once we got
to our destination. So we ate, we
drank, we speculated, and iinally
we approached Des Moines

As the bus took the exit to Des
Moines, our agenda was revealed
to us, We would be given tickets
that would allow us to enter the
auditorium. Seats were reserved
ior us in speciiic sections oi the
balcony. The auditorium would not
open until 5730, so in the meantime,
we were free to inspect the various
tents candidates had set up out
Side.

we then were given instructions.
Each 0! us would receive a noise
maker, We were to use these to
make noise when Dukakis tto
whom we were beholden for beer
and munchies} was announced.
Under no circumstances were we
to make noise ior any other can
didate, or while any other person
was speaking After we had been
given a chance to digest our lesson

Simon’s was almost empty. but
people were in it setting up tables
with real iood 7stuii that required
shiny containers and warming
dishes. We took special note or this
and. by some magical power, kept
gravitating back to Simon‘s tent
We decided that, on the basis oi
iood oiiercd, Simon would win our
votes hands down

As we resumed our quest ior
noise-makers, candidates started
to arrive First came Simon, then
came Babbitt, then came a rumor
that Dukakls was on his way. All oi
us little Dukakisians crowded obe-
diently around his tent, eagerly an
tiClpatmg his arrival “Signs!" we
were told. “Hold up your signs!"
As one oi Dukakis' coordinators
shoved a sign in my hand, another
tried to get the crowd to chant
some Dukakis cheers It is amaz-
ing what some people will chant it
they are just told to do it. i listened
while some UNI females picked up
the cheer and shouted .with en

in noise-maker etiquette and pro
vided with a bag containing a sand
wich, apple, and chips, we were
told that we should go first to the
Dukakis tent to get one ot his signs
to hold in the balcony. Then we
were released. We scrambled oii oi
the bus and went in Search of the
Dukakis tent, purported home oi
noise~makers and signs

We did not find any noiseamakers
there, but we did find some food 7
candy apples, peanuts, pretzels —
buttons, and hats. We adorned
ourselves like good little sup-
porters oi a candidate and went to
inspect other candidates' tents.

Democrats’

On Saturday, November 7, I
went to the Jeiiersondackson Day
Dinner in Des Moines. The
Jeiiersondackson Day Dinner is
an annual event sponsored by the
lowa Democratic party. All six
Presidential candidates gave halla
hour speeches Saturday night. I

John Newmark

entered the Des Moines Convention
Center knowing very little about
most oi the candidates except the
little I had read in the Register the
preceding months and basically
willing to support any oi the six
Democrats over any oi the six
Republicans in the ultimate
showdown next November l exited
the Convention Center early Sun
day morning, November a, know-
inga little more about each can-
didate but still not really iavoring
any one oi them. However, there
were three occurrences that night
that made the event well worth my
attendance These three occur-

Dinner a

rences combined gave me
something to laugh about,
something to cry about, and
something to think about; this
variety oi emotional responses
helped make it a night I will not
soon forget.

The actual proceedings began at
7 PM. with a prayer, which was
iollowed by an hour oi cheering,
yelling, and parading ior all six
candidates. At approximately a
PM., an Iowa Democratic
chairperson managed to quiet the
crowd and introduced the first of
an endless line of Iowa Democrats
in the state government. After a
Video showing the iive newest
Democratic office-holders in the
state. a man walked to the podium
and started pleading ior money i
was first reminded of PBS
telethons, then of Bakker. Falwell.
and Swaggart, I chuckled at the
similarity. but I felt somewhat
sorry tor the man at the podium
who got stuck with this job. In just
a few moments, however, I would
ieel even more sorry, and my
chuckle would turn into a laugh.

The man knew he had to get all
the supporters oi individual
Presidential candidacles to feel
like giving money to the
Democrats on the state level as

££1037

well, so he began to imitate the
television ministers i mentioned
earlier, 1 don't remember the ex-
act words that he used. but he said
something to the eiiect oi, “All
those who support Simon, reach in-
to your pockets. Give $50, $100,
anything. but just reach into your
pockets, reach into your hearts and
give." Then he continued with,
“All those who support Simon or
Gephardt, reach into your
pocket All those who support
Simon. Gephardt, or babbitt..
He continued to add a candidate
until he reached his conclusion,
“All those who support Simon,
Gephardt, Babbitt, Dukakis. or
Gore, or even it you are undecided,
reach into your pockets " There
were a iew people near me who
whispered, “He iorgot one, he
iorgot one " And throughout the
hall could be heard the roots oi a
chant- “Jesse, Jesse, Jesse." Em-
barrassed, naturally, he quickly
amended the list to include
Jackson. 1 was later told that he
had been looking down the row of
candidates on the platiorm in
order to make sure he
remembered each one, but
