AS a result of this inadequacy,
numerous rolls were taken into a
town studio for developing.

Furthermore, literally hundreds
of pictures were not even printed
until after graduation, on a night
during which the photography
editor stayed up all night in an at-
tempt to finish the job. And even
then, there were still further pic~
tures that had to be printed by the
editor. The tasks of choosing, crop-
ping. laying out. and captioning all
oi these pictures still remained.
Yearlong delays in production were
due in large part to the chronic
shortage of any photos irom which
to choose. The problem of the miss-
ing captions cited by the stall
photographers is an unfortunate
result 01' these continual delays —
it is impossible to caption photos
that have not yet been taken.

its for the pholographers' claims
of being left out of meetings, the
weekly Monday meetings were
Open to the entire stall. However.
the job oi choosing which pictures
to include in the book and the for
mat in which to present them was
strictly an editorial one Despite
the stall photographers" claims to
the contrary. the photography

editor was involved in these decl- ‘

sions on numerous occasions. Oi

course the photographers have a ‘

right to their opinion of the book.
but a large part of their “dismay"
may be due to a misunderstanding
,of our goals for the book: we in-
tended it not as a standard. coma

ing endless three-to-arpage group
shots, but as a more flowing,

we take special offense at the
photographers claims of careless
sabotage and vandalization to a
projert to which we devoted
countless hours, tremendous
thought, and worry. Our commit
ment to the book was deep enough
to carry us through a grueling
week spent finishing the Cyclone

departed for summer break,

we restrain ourselves in others'l

Jackson's airplane had been
delayed so he wasn't there yet, At
the time, though, I couldn't control
my laughter and my sympathy for
the man's embarrassment.

At approximately 9 PM, the
candidates began to give their
speeches At 10:30 P.M.. Babbitt,
the third speaker, almost made me
cry with the following words:
‘tThis afternoon Gore and l have
been discussing what we did in col-
lege We agree on one thing
politically at least, there should be
a statute of limitations.” For those
who need the explanation, Babbitt
and Gore. in response to Douglas
Ginsberg's previous announcer
ment of marijuana use. had admit.
ted to using marijuana in college.
Ginsberg, Saturday afternoon, had
removed himself {mm the nomina-
tion to the Supreme Court because
of the press's disclosure about his
former drug use My mind instant
ly flashed back to Hart. Blden, and
Dukakis, Dukakis had survived}
but not Hart and Elden, Who would I
be next” Would Gore- and Babbittl
have to remove themselves from l
the competition? l was openly
praying that it wouldn't come to:
that. and I don't think it will,

A poll was taken Sunday: it ask- 1
ed whether voters across the na
tion would still vote for Babbitt or ‘
Gore after they heard about their 1
marijuana use. Only 27 percent.
said marijuana use would
negatively allect their opinion of.
any candidate, and my own per-i
sonal belief is that the majority oi l
those are Republicans or extreme
ly conservative Democrats, Casual
use during the 1960s at college can»
not be considered a major felony.
This would make criminals of the
entire Age of Aquarius The college
graduates of the 19605 are now in
their lorties or so and must be
recognized for who they are now,
not who they were then, The fact
that Ginsberg backed down is sad
dening. Even though I didn't want
to see him as a Supreme Court
justice, l agreed with Biden who
considered publicly urging him
NOT to back down just for the sake
oi his marijuana use. Nobody is
perfect, so we can't expect our
Presidents or judges to be.

The final event, the one that
made me think, was a questionl
posed by a fellow Grinncllian. l-Ie l
asked me whether I was registered
in lowa, I am registered in
Missouri, where I have lived [or
the past 18 years, and I will remain
registered there. i don't feel coma
iortable voting in a place I don't
live. and while I may eat, sleep,
and work here nine months of the
year. I still live in Missouri, pay
taxes in Missouri, and will vote in
Missouri my entire four years here
at Grinnell.

My highschool calculus teacher
often asked his students to rate
their weekend from a I to a 10. If
only one good thing happened, we
were to give it a 3; two good things
warranted a 6. three good things
during the weekend were required
[or a 9 or a 10. Saturday evening I
laughed, cried. and was asked a
question that forced me to reason
out an answer. It was a rare
weekend during my senior year in
high school that warranted the
perfect 10 that last weekend
received.

saw camera operators amusing
themselves by turning their lights
on and off, on and off, and watr

crowd.

When the doors i‘inally opened,
we made our way up to our balcony
seats. Our patience was rewarded
as we finally were handed our
noisermakers. Previous to this,
some people impatient to make
noise had stolen some noise-
makers irom Gephardt's tent.
These were an inferior sort, made
oi yellow paper. They were the
kind that roll out when you blow on
them, then curl back up: they were
the kind that become soggy and
useless alter they have been used
only a very short time at a three-
yearrnld's birthday party We, on
the other hand, were given some
serious noise-makers, metal ones
that would spin around and go “bb-

a lot of people who appeared to be

Dear Editors:

As I was walking back from
Burling Library, having turned in
a few books, I felt, as i sometimes
tool, a funny sort of community
with the several elements oi my
world: nature,’n1ind, technology,
music, a few others, But just as l

= was singing the tirst line of "La
2 Bamba" upon reaching Park

Street, I felt all unity collapse, For
as i looked across the street to
what my grandparents once called

 

a "landmark" for my locale, I saw
that the chrome emblem had been
taken irom the front of my '72
Volkswagon Bus, leaving a paint-
green "VW" where it used to be.
It was as if someone had snuck
into my room at night and shaved
oli my red hair. It was as if so-
meone had thrown a,brick and
gashed my acoustic guitar. it was
as it someone had burned an old

, recording of a song I'd done with

my friends in high school it was as

. it I'd watched someone kick my

sister‘s dog in lront of her
I have grown up with that green

l bus It was our family car when I

was six years old. When we took
trips to southern Missouri and
eastern lowa to visit relatives, or
when we drove to Carlsbad
Caverns or the Grand Canyon. I
traveled on sofa cushions my
lather had placed over the luggage
in the "Meece Hole“ 7 our name
for the compartment above the
engine ln back, I slept to its rumble
ing. And. later, when the car was
“inothhalled” in our back yard,
my iriend Doug and I still fooled
I around inside it, pushing buttons

emblem

and knobs, making believe it was a
James Bond vehicle. When I got
my license. my parents put it back
on insurance and let me drive it. I
remember parking it literally
bumper to bumper with Doug's vw
(very ironic that his parents too
had a green Volkswagon Bus 7
theirs a '79). i remember kissing
the horn on the steering wheel
when it would start for me on the
first turn of the key

I never took it on a date. lguessl
was all too sure it wouldn't impress
any girl from Liberty. Missouri. it
makes me wonder about the song i
wrote with Doug called "Sail On
Green Bus" which. to me. has
something to do with being dli-r
fereiit and being proud of it

Before i brought the car to Grinv
ncll my sophomore year, i worked
for about a week sanding off the
rust spots, cutting out the rusted
out spots, filling them with
Chickenrwire and covering them
with fiberglass. priming, and
finishing the job with a can of
green spray paint I'd found buried
on a shelf in Dad's “shop" The col»
