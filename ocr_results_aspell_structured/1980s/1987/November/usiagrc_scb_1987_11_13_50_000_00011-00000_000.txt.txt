my same iriend Doug and I
managed to fix the di'iver'ssside
window which had been inoperable
some seven years, being held up by
a twosby-iour. ,

Some might say, as I've pro
bably said about certain things,
that it is silly to be attached to
something so material 7 trivial
things like chrome letters. i don't
know. Call me silly l guess We
might all like to conceive of identis
ty as a phenomenon based wholly on
one's inner Self, or what have
you. But. just as with the red hair
or the guitar, or maybe an old pair
oi boots, i guess i‘vc somehow
managed to see liie in these things.
I ieel a little bit oi my spirit me
lermeshed with thcm. The hair will
grow back, i can get a new and
better guitar. a new and better pair
at boots: and my sister's dog will

took the emblem Will sneak back
one nightand pop it back in as easr

it is attached only by small pegs.
Otherwise, i guess i will have to
content myself with going to the
junkyard _ as i did to replace the
