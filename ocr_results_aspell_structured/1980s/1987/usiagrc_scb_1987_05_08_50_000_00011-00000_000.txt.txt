Runner LeFebvre Has
Faith 'In Humanity

by Phil Lefebvre

Ever have one of those experiences that
totally reaffirm your faith in humanity?

We were stopped over in Nashville on the
way south for spring break. My mom and
I. her on business, me on pleasure, were
together touring a part of the country I’d
never seen i really wanted to get out and
meet people and get a feel for what the
area was like, but I didn't know where to
start. I decided Yd take a run around town
and take in the sites.

I was testing totally worn out from drive
ing, but I love running around in new sure
roundings, and with tired but curious legs I
took oil for a romp around downtown
Nashville. I felt the usual sense of freedom
and discovery that attracts me to running,
but this time I felt something more, sort of
like a pioneer exploring a new territory,
with my only limit being my strength.

or Course my strength was limited, and
atter that exhilarating high wore off I
realized 1 was still pretty tired and very
hungry, so I schiepped back to the hotel
with the ideas of a hot shower and a good
breakfast tilling my head. Unfortunately,
the shower was busy, but since it was cool
enough that I wasn‘t sweating. I threw on a
clean T-shirt, grabbed five bucks, ant‘
headed out in search of chow.

I decided against the hotel's restaurant
and headed into downtown. I immediately
came across a tiny hole-in-therwall of a
diner. There were two police cars parked
outside. so i figured the place either had
good food or was being raided. 0p»
timisticaliy opting for the former. 1 step-
ped through the clean but decaHovered
glass door and into the cultural gold mine I
was looking for.

In a sense the place seemed cliched.
There were a lot of those signs with stupid
positive sayings on them that no hardened,
sophisticated, big-city person could ever
take seriously. Of course there was the
signed and framed "first dollar earned by
the place” next to the Cera'1950 cash
register. a pin with old tickets stuck on it.
a jar of mints, a box of toothpicks. and the
other accoutrements of a local diner. The
place was not tacky at all though, In fact,
even though plain it felt very comfortable
and homey. sort of like my-unclertherauto-
worker's bungalow in Detroit, Not fancy.
but Warm and livable.

There were live booths. and a counter
with about eight seats. all made of pine. no
for-mica or anything like that. Most of

them were filled with the likes of truck
drivers, laborers. and local businessmen
in cheap yet cl‘isprlooking clothes, and of
course the cops, forever dunking donuts in
their Coffees, talking about bowling and
their wives, their radios growling softly on
the counter next to them. It was a place
patronized by regulars, and I was quickly
conscious of everyone givmg this stranger
the once over

The reaction that surprised me. though,
was that of the matron of the house. She
was A short woman wrth a well coifed
head of silver hair, a strong and weathered
face, and warm motherly blue eyes that
made her seem so much younger than the
rest of her led one to believe. At that mo-
ment, though, they were filled with a sort
oi surprised horror, as though someone
who she thought had long died had just
reappeared. I immediately checked to see

if I was still wearing shorts or something,

"Any image I may have
harbored of myself as
being some...atbletic stud

and nervously slid into a boot , She march-
ed over to where i was sitting, and said

cent to get the full effect), "Why look at
you. Yer all drawn an' tired out. Are you
awl ri’ht'!"

Although I hadn't checked in a mirror, I
assumed I must've looked like shit or
something.

I replied “Well, yes ma'am. i am a bit
tired and hungry. I lust got done running."

”Runnin’} From what?" she said,

“Nothin',” I said.” I run track and I’m
just out running to get in shape for the
season.”

“In shape!" she gasped, “Why look at
you. You ’bout as Skinny as a rail. You look
like an alley dog that's been caught out in
the rain,“ Any image I may have harbored
about myself as being some well-built,
athletic-looking stud was totally
destroyed. ”Let me fix ya a big breakfast,
get you somethln' lhat‘ll put some meat on
them bones. Now what would ya like?”

i ordered the big breakfast. two eggs
scrambled. ham, and two pancakes, with
toast, and a large milk, Before I knew it,

my milk, and some cofiee

“Uh, ma'am, this isn't my order," I
timidly asserted.

“No, no You go ahead and eat it. I‘ll
have your breakfast up in a jiffy,”

“But ma’am, I‘ve only got five dollars,

‘Don‘t you worry. You'll be fine It’s on
the house Now hurry up and eat that.”

Never being one that has to be told twice
to eat free food, I polished it all on pretty
quickly. Right away she brought over the
rest of the food, all the while wearing this
expression of confident contentment, like
everything was going just the way she
planned it.

The food she brought was utterly fans
tastlc The scent of freshrmade breakfast
was something i hadn’t smelled in a long
time, and I was flooded with memories of.
big, lazy, hearty Sunday breakfasts. I
could tell she threw in an extra egg, and
she brought three pancakes instead of two,
all in the effort to fatten me up, get me to
look “healthy" or something. It was one of
the best meals I had the whole trip, and as
l was shoveling it in I gave her a deep,
sincere look of appreciation, She respond
ed with one of those knowing looks of
satisfaction only a mother could give, and
suddenly l was feeling totally at home.

Nothirds of the way through I slowed
to just soak up all the sensations of the
morning, to let the feelings and memories
sink in a bit. She worriedly looked over and
quickly said, “Is everything awi ri'ht?"

“Oh yes ma’am! This is really good.
Thanks so much! "

She brought over the check, which was
for $3.42, or just what I had ordered, I left
the flvedollar bill under the plate. and
thanked her so much for the great

breakfast. I told her it was all really nice of _

her and she didn’t have to do all that.

I really didn't know what else to say,
Even after t'our years in Grinnell, Ihave a
hard time believmg in the sincere kindness
and openness of a helpful stranger. It’s
partly plain old big city cynicism. I mean,
why would anyone want to treatsome total
bum off the Street like her son? What was I
ever going to do for her'! (Except maybe

What I
Learned As

Sports
Editor

by Karin Sedestrom

We could call this, “What I learned as S
and B sports editor, by Karin Sedestrom."

in my onersemester tenure as Scarlet
and Black sports editor, I learned that
writers, it I may generalize wildly, are
pretty reliable about deadlines. And ifthey
aren't going to be, they will warn you. For
any would-be editors out there, I'm sure
that's a comfort

I've learned that you can't print a story
unless it is either facts. or someone‘s opir
nion. This is very basic and makes sense,
as well as assuring that the paper is not
mere drivel. It's a good editorial policy to
follow. ,

I also learned that if work expands to fit
the time available, then the oppoSlte is
true. It is truly amazing how fast you can
get a paper done it you know that you
aren't going to be able to work on it
Wednesday or Thursday, because of S and
B editorial duties.

One of the more important things I found
out is that most people will help you out
when you are in trouble about a story. I
remember the terrible week, before [shad
regular writers, that i didn’t get any
releases at all from Sports Information.
This meant that I had to call various pen»
pie on various teams and ask them what
they remembered about the game or meet.
I remember talking to Kamryn Costello

"The 'dread Thursday
aftemoons’ downtown at

the Grinnell
Herald-Register...were

alwa s amusing. ”

and Heather Lauver as well as Steve
Pickle and John Williams for swimming,
and Geoff Larson and Mark Gempner for
hockey, They were all very helpful to an
editor in a panic, And when I was done,
after about an hour the phone and several
more on the computer shaping all the in-
formation into articles, I thought, ”Wow! I
did it i" and then, "Can I go to sleep now?”

I will always remember, and now I'm
starting to sound like a high school year
book, the editor’s meetings in the office.
