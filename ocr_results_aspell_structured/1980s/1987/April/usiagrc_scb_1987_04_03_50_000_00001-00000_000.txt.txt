“Thg studentsdesigned interdisciplinary
concentration is ‘diplomati Zation’ of the
Grinnell diploma. It is commencement
program clutter," said Don Smith pro-
fessor of history and a member of the cur-
riculum committee. The studentsdesigned

vote of 43 to 13 on Monday. it was the cur-

Munyon also said, “A strong student in-

"The Issue 01 the Sch as 21 minor is red

Students would receive a “concentra-
tion" by taking a minimum 01 22 credits
from two or more academic divisions
related to a central topic or theme. Simllal’
proposals were previously presented
before the faculty, the most recent being
the proposal {or a minor that the iaculty
rejected.

In speaking against the proposed SDIC
before the faculty, Paul Munyon, professor
of economics and membr of the cur
riculum committee said, “The model of
the SDIC is the minor which never came to
be.” Munyon added, “The SDlC is a fun-

(iaculty) approval,”
- Munyon responded to Voyles comments
by stating that he could see “tremendous
pressure” for students to get concentra-
tions in order to gain an edge on admission
to graduate schools Munyon estimated
that nearly a hundred students would
enroll in coneent tion programs.

in iurther cr zing the SDIC proposal,
Don Smith said that he believed that a
Grinnell education should be one of
“breadth” and should not “highlight
idiosyncrasy.”
