French queried on American ‘

inﬂuences; language number 1

by Mayrlec Chai

In a recent "sondage" or opinion poll, of
is inhabitants ol Rennes, France, he per
cent answered that the United States had
iniiuenced the French language more than
it had inﬂuenced any other aspect oi
French life. (Television ran a close se»
cond.) The 45 people also answered ques-
tions about the influence of the United
States on the cinema, advertising,
clothing, music, and cuisine.

Over threequarters of the respondents
gave several reasons for their feeling that
the US, had influenced French television.
The government is currently selling three
of the government-owned TV channels to
private bidders. People expressed concern
that this action is following “the American
model" of television which Has “very little
culture" and “is not very intellectual "
This, they feel, will result in the "‘Abaser
ment of the culture" on French TV. Others
of those French people polled pointed to
the great number of American series and
mDVIeS on French TV. On any given day.
the TV guide listed 20 shows of American
origin

As for the cinema, most people agreed
that “there are influences, but it remains
the cinema Francaise.” One young man
summed up the differences: “We don't
have the big productions but can make
films with small means, like “Three Men
and a Cradle,’ which was very
successful,"

Although the majority oi the inhabitants
of Rennes interviewed felt that the Us.
has inﬂuenced French advertising, most of
them said that the influence was very
small, with the exception oi the cutting up
of movies for television programming. In
general, there are no commercial breaks
in the middle oi programs. only at certain

other times.

This has, however, begun to change, and
for the first time, on Monday, March 2, the
newly privatized channel a cut into a shovi»
lng oi “The Year of lemg Dangerously”
(“L'Annee de Tous Ies Dangers") for com-
mercials.

pointed out that, as in the United States,
the iniluence on music is primarily
British. However, she did note the lasting
innuencc oi American jazz in France

or course, the majority oi the natives
questioned felt that the French cuisine

 

rests "number one in the world," despite

It is interesting to note that three clerks
in an "American“ clothing store did not
believe that the U.S. had iniluenced
French advertising in any way, Further»
more, two oi the three iclt that the us had
no iniluence on the clothing in France.

It is not surprising that the majority oi
people interviewed did not admit to v.5.
influence on French dressing habits. “But
no. it is we who have influenced the
Americans," one woman said. However,
most students recognized the hooiprint oi
the States in the ubiquitous bluerjeans,

Almost everyone thought the us. had in»
llucnced French music, One woman

the inﬂuence of “le lastfood Americain "

As for that most revered bastion of
French culture, the language itself, an
astonishing so percent oi the French

speakers polled teit that “on a certain -

level, with Certain words,” the U.S. has in-
fluenced their language.

One young man with greased~back hair,
dressed in black leather, with a long scar
that ran from his temple to his chin,
pointed to the Coke he was drinking and
said, ”Of course the US, has influenced
France Here‘s the proof 7 Coke!” Then
he added in a single breath, as if it were a
single word. “Oui-okay-yOUrgetrit ”

Passover:

Jews don’t let
their bread rise

Courtesy oi Chalutzim
The Jewish holiday oi Passover begin
at sunset this coming Monday, April 13,
and ends With sunset eight days later, o
Tuesday, April 21. Passover, “Pesach” i
Hebrew, commemorates the departure 0
603,550 Jewish families from Egypt aroun
the year 1250 B CE. The Exodus ended 43-

years of slavery under the 18th an 19
dynasties of Egyptian pharaohs and too
place probably under the reign of Ramses
II or possibly during the religious revolu
tion of Ikhnaton, Although the holiday to
day has principally a historical
significance, it was once called “Chag ha
AVlv,” or "the Spring Festival," and ha-
additional significance as a Celebration 0
springtime rebirth.

when the Nation oi Israel prepared t
leave Egypt, they had so little time tha
they could not even let their bread rise in
the oven; the iirst born of all Egyptians,
“both man and beast." had been slain
earlier that same day by God and Pharoah
was sure to seek revenge soon. In chapte
13 of the Book of Exodus, Gud commands
Israel to commemorate yearly their
redemption irom slavery that day by
removing all leaven trom their houses, by
eating “no leavened bread" _ bread that
has been allowed to rise — for one week,
and by teaching their children the history
surrounding the Exodus.

BITNET shrinks communication gap:
Grinnell students meet outsiders

"’We subscribed to BITNET to enhance the

There can be as little as none, and as

many as iitty on the relay at the same
time By using the different channels,
students talk to other users from all over
the world. Most of the links are with other
academic computers. Studenls write to
each other, in conversation form, about
various topics ranging irom religion and
politics to relationships and music

And according to Ed McGuire of Com-
puter Services, 111 people have signed on

This allows the users to lessen the risks ins
volved in meeting new people, Said Beth
Atkinson, “It's harmless enough They're

them." And there are other risks, because
the users cannot really know how the other
person is communicating. “You miss the
voice inflections and the facial ex‘pres

While some users see this as a challenge
in learninng more about human interac»

depressed schizophrenic who suddenly
threatens suicide," Relay users are
reminded that they have lowest priority on
the system. But, it any Grinnellians are
ever really lonely, they may have the com-
tort that all they need to do is type “Send
