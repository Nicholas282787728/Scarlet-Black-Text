Shoah-- epic
documentary on Holocaust

)y Robert Fein
I iirst began to understand the Holocaust
)n a spring afternoon in 1981, in the base-
nent of my synagogue in the Bronx. 1 was
,aking a course there on World War II with
)ther iZ-year-olds, and we sat around a
glass-covered table, the black-and-White
iaces or past rabbis and synagogue
aresidents smiling down at us Irom the
walls Nice a week. we attended two»
iour-long discussions led by Rabbi Balter
and Perry Neder, a teacher We had been
sitting in that windowless room twice
weekly for months like this, and I'm not
Sure why I broke into tears on that one day.
The past, which is usually safely removed
irom us in the pages of textbooks, and
irom which we distance ourselves with the
comforting, inhuman, clinical detachment
practiced in the classroom, suddenly came
alive for me, and it was at that moment
that I began to understand the Holocaust
“Shoah,” in Hebrew, “Annihilation,” is

Nazis' destruction of European Jewry dur-

11 years by the 60~yearold Parisian jourr

who fought in the Resistance during World
War ll, trekked through 14 countries and
lilmed over 350 hours of interviews with
survivors, iorrncr Nazi 55 officers, local
Witnesses to the slaughter, and scholars
specializing in the historical period.

The result is a documentary like no
other, The film inlcudes no historical
footage or stock pictures of the death
camps’ horrors but focuses instead on the
present day. Mr. Lanzmann said that he
wanted to combat the notion that the
Holocaust is Something that belongs only
to textbooks, museums, and memories,
“The lilm I have made is a counterrmyth,”
the director said. “It is an inquiry on the
present oi the Holocaust or at the very
least on a past whose scars are still so

Latin
American
folk recital

by Bruce Emond

A recital of Latin American folk music
will be held on Sunday, April 5, at 2 p.m. in
Herrick Chapel. Karin Stein, a 1954 Grin-
nell College graduate, Ted Solis, assistant
in music, and Alma lowana, an Iowa City
trio specializing in Andean music, will per-
form a mixture of instrumental and vocal
pieces. Among the instruments used are
bongos, capachos, quena, guiro, and
marlmba

The reci 31 features the music of 14 Latin
American countries including Argentina.
Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El
Salvador, and Peru. Stein, who was born
and raised in Colombia and is still a COI-
ombian citizen, said the main purpose of
the recital is to “give a broad survey of the
many types of music found in Latin
America," music which “varies between
very iast pieces to slow ones." The recital
blends old pieces, some dating to pre
Colombian times, with contemporary folk
tunes. Admission is free but patrons will
have the opportunity to give donations to
aid a Salvadoran refugee camp.
