"When you go
without food for a
while, the hunger
changes to a
diﬁ'erent level. I
got to feeling that
hunger was good.
I started to love it.”

-Tina

Tina's problems with eating
disorders began during her
sophomore year in high school
when she started to believe that
she needed to be thinner. However,
it was only in her junior year that
she began dieting seriously, She
set flVe'pound weightioss goals ior
herseli and as they were achieved
“everyone started to notice, Suds
denly I was doing something right
and actually accomplishing
something.” said Tina.

Tina was never Satisfied with her
weight loss, “I fell 1 could lose
more," she said. “like i should lose
more, just another two pounds."

In Tina‘s iamily, three sibdown
meals were very important and
her mother liked everyone to be
“on the heavy side ” Tina believed
her anorexia “was a kind of
rebellion," an “innate desire” to
do the opposite oi her mother's
wishes, She often lied to her
mother to hide what she was trying
to do Tina says she “got. by”
eating a small bowl oi cereal ior
breakiast, and throwing away all
but a green apple irom her lunch
Occasionally, such as when a
teacher provided iood during an
exam. instead of having the apple
she would eat a pretzel. one of her
favorite treats, "I could take one
pretzel and make it last," she Said,

Tina was active in school and
social activities. especially dance
ing and periorming |n musicals. so
she could oiten keep busy during
dinner. but, she said, she was still
“obsessed Wltil it."

“All day I was thinking about
dinner last night, visualizing it,"
she said

Tina claimed that “when you go
without food tor a while, the
hunger changes to a different
level i got to reeling that hunger
was good. I started to love it"

Dying to be thin

Four Students dim their battles with eating disorders

when visiting a restaurant or ice
cream parlor with friends, Tina
would order only a glass or water
and watch her friends eat, while
making herseli psychologically
iull. She could “imagine, just
visualize a sundae and mentally
taste it,” she explained. “You
don't consume it, but mentally you
get ilavor, temperature, and texc
lure."

Tina went to such extremes with
her Calorie counting that she reins»
ed even to lick a postage stamp ior
fear of the calories that she might
ingest. One activity that she en-
joyed was trying on her younger
sister’s clothes, when they began
to lit, she put herseli “on a perma
nent high,” she said, “I felt really
good about myseli at the time, and
my grades went up. lcould change
anything into an accomplishment.
ignoring the health problems.”
which included seven monﬂis of
amenhorrea, hair loss, hypotherr
mia, insomnia, and dizziness.

After reaching a low oi 95
pounds. irom an original 150
pounds, “something clicked, and
my mind was separate from my
body," she explained. At this stage
Tina became bulimic; she craved
sugar. when leit alone in the
house, Tina said she would "go
Crazy” and would eat, tor examr
pie, “a half of loaf of banana
bread, cookies, frozen cookies, ice
cream.” and anything else she
could iind. “I wasn't even tasting
it," she said, “just shoving it in,”
These “rampages,” as she called
them. were sporadic and made her
feel so sick that she exercised com-
pulsively.

The anorexia and bulimia then
became cyclic, “Like a real
strange tug oi war,” she said. “I'd
get so depressed.” She would wake
up and tell herseli, “l‘m not going
to go crazy today," because she
knew her behavior was unhealthy,
Tina first realized she was sufter~
mg irom a disorder when she read
about it in one oi her psychology
text books; yet without any treat»
ment or therapy, she has been able
to control it, However, she believes
that her metabolism is “screwed
up"; she has an adverse reaction
to both green apples and sugar.
“To this day I can’t get myseli to
eat a candy bar," she concluded,

"I thought that I

thought i could be thinner." Even»
tually the idea oi being thin was an
obsession and he limited his diet to
“black coliee. dry Rice krispies,
and a bizarre combination ot bran,
hot water, and a teaspoon oi
honey.” He did occasionally eat a
piece oi ham or cheese because he
knew that he would lose muscle
tissue without any protein in his
diet

Craig was soon too thin for
sports, but he exercised by walking
the two miles distance to school
and back home during lunch so
that he could weigh himseli. Then 5
feet 7 inches tall, his weight drops
ped from 130 pounds to 102 pounds
in two months. Although he ”feltso
exhilarated,” at the time. Craig
now looks back on old photographs
and sees himself as someone who
looked “unhappy and gaunt and
weak, like someone living on the
edge.” He did. however, remain a
good student.

According to Craig, both oi his
parents “were overweight and cons
tinually dieting.” He thinks that
his parents' iniluence aiiected the
occurrence of his disorder, “I was
always a Shy and introverted child
who listened and obeyed my
parents " Food “was very impor-
tant” in his family and “was used
as a punishment, reward, and
pacifier," Craig said, As he got
thinner. his parents pushed him to
eat even more. which made his
conviction to diet greater.

Upon seeing a doctor, Craig
learned about the consequences oi
anorexia nervosa. “I didn’t want to
admit it then but he really scared
me when he said that I wouldn’t
grow anymore," remembered
Craig. He said his parents‘ concern
for him and their ‘hands off' at-
titude in helping with his weight.
Over the next year he gained back
nearly ten pounds

When he was nearly iiiteen,
Craig came to the US. “I didn’t
want to keep on gaining weight."
said Craig. To maintain his weight,
Craig developed a bulimic cycle.
He would skip breakiast and lunch
except for a piece oi {wit and black
coffee, starving himself until he
got home irom school, At home
Craig would binge, eating con-
tinually until around ll) o'clock
every night. “Sometimes I would
eat so much that I would have to
throw up,” he Said. He read that
drinking a lot oi water was “a good
way of ridding toxins from the
body," and so would saturate his
stomach with water to iacilitate
Vomiting. “Whenever I felt the

the best tennis playerlneed to throw up," he said, “i

everything. "
~Craig

Craig, a sophomore, also sour
cumbed to both anorexia nervosa
and bulimia, it began at age thir-
tcen, ostensibly as a concern ior
nutrition. However, Craig said he
had always been iiercely coma
petitive and ambitious and this
ligured in his desire to be thin “i
thought that i would be even more
successiul ii i was thin, i wanted to
be the best student, the best tennis
player, everything,” he said.

He spent “hours poring over
vegatarianwand health'ffo'od

would drink glass after glass oi
water until I threw up." Craig also
abused laxatives. “I used my
mother's Epsom salts now and
then." he said. “I would take two
or three times the recommended
dose and drink them with orange
juice.” He recollects that “it was
horrible i always tell so weak and
tired.” Nonetheless, throughout
high school Craig maintained his
weight at no pounds.

Aiter graduating irom high
school, Craig went away ior a year
as an exchange student and, under
the scrutiny oi his host iamily, he
was unable to continue his bulimic
habits. He weighed 165 pounds

specter oi anorexia is always
there,” he said.

“Being anorexic is so over-
glorified," said Karen. “A lot oi
people think it's iashionable
because you lose lots of weight and
get lots of attention " But, she con-
tinued, “if you’re truly anorexic,
you don't know what the hell is goV
ing on It's not a conscious decir
sum."

During her illness, Karen began
her day by waking up at tour or
five o'clock in die morning and ex
ercismg until it was “tno late
to eat breakiast and get to school
on time. She purposely scheduled
classes so that she could "skip
lunch and be on the go.” in fact,
karen did not have a lunch period
ior the tour years she was in high
school. Because she was extremely
involved in drama and other acs
tivitics, excuses were easy to come
by ior not eating dinner at home
“You can convince yourseli that
you're not hungry." she said. when
she was at home, an obsession with
cooking was apparent. “I collected
over 200 Cookbooks,” she said.
Because the family saw her cook~
ing. they assumed that she ate
while she cooked and again, an
easy excuse was made “There
was a lot oi lying," she admitted.

Karen set weight. goals for
herself based on pictures of ex
tremely thin models that She Cut
out oi magazines, As kind oi a test
for thinness, she would lie on her
back and measure the concave
space between her protruding hip
bones Numerical weight was also
very important to her “When you
get on the scale and see that you've
lost five pounds, it's like the
greatest high, 1 never realized how
skinny i really was " Karen hit a
low weight oi so pounds, at which
point she was unable to walk due to
the amount oi cartilage lost irom
her feet,

for anorexia, Karen became
“overwhelmed with food" and
leapt into a bulimic state. Through
the course of bulimia, she was
overcome with guilt and ultimately
tried to kill herself. Again she was
hospitalized.

Reasons for the occurrence of
her eating disorders are many, but
she believes two major factors
were her unconscious [ear oi grown
mg up and poor tamily com-
munication, “Our family wasn't
very good at communicating," she
said. The most Verbal member of
the family was the television set.”
Family therapy was a big part of
Karen’s treatment. In addition,
she felt. that she was able to keep
herseli from growing up when she
had the disorder; that she had con-
trol “It i didn't get my period, i
could go back to being a little girl,
where there weren't so many com~
plications in my life."

Now Karen is stable and “for the
most part." ieels good, But, she
said, "it's very easy tolinger in the
past and to be overcome with what
happened "

”If I would indulge in
one bad thing then it
