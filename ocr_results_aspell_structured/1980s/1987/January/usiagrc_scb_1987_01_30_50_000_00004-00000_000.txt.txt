Pref back from Russia:

Kaiser Laments
Cultural Myopia

by Kirsten Pullen

Associate Professor of History Daniel
Kaiser recently returned to Grinnell after
an eighteenrmonth leave oi absence.
Kaiser left Grinnell in Order to conduct
research for a book he is writing on family
life in Russia during the fifteenth and six
teenth centuries. For the final four monﬂis
of his absence from Grinnell, he and his
family lived in the Soviet Union while he
conducted his research there.

While In the Soviet Union, Kaiser studied
original dowrles and wills to examine the
rituals of family life. Kaiser is interested
in the roles that gender and kinship played
in the change oi property, land, and post
lion in medieval Russian society.

According to the dawries and wills, pros
perty and land changed hands with women
as they were married, but were given to
men after the death of the owners. Gent‘Ler
determined who had power in Society.

Kaiser said that this has not changed
much for the post-revolution Soviets.
Women now bear a “double yoke": most
have fullvtime jobs and are also expected
to be successful homemakers. In addition,
women often work at lower-paying jobs
than men, In this way, the Soviet Union is
very much like the United States.

In addition to his research, Kaiser
delivered several papers at Soviet educa-
tional conferences and discussed the dif-
(erences between Soviet and American
higher education with Soviet educators,
About Soviet systems of education, Kaiser
commented, “I am astounded by the
disparity of views in education where
education is determined historically by the
government."

Because of his Work and his previous
visits to the Soviet Union, he was able to
make friends with Soviet citizens and
learn about their lifestyles.

In the Soviet Union, there are many
ethnic groups, including Muslims, Asians,
Europeans, and Negroes in addition to
native Russians After the Communist
revolution, these different ethnic groups
were joined together as Soviet citizens.

Americans usually assume that all of the
people living in the Soviet Union are Rus-
sian, but Russians are only one ethnic
group. All people in the Soviet Union are
Soviets, but they are not all Russian. A
“Soviet” is the Same as an “American,”
while a “Russian" is the same as a
“Hispanic.”

Americans enjoy a much higher stan-
dard of living than do the Soviets. While
the Kaiscrs lived in Moscow and Len»
ingrad, they lived comparatively better
than their friends did. The Kaisers were
able to shop in the peasant markets, where
the prices are less frequently regulated
and there are more goods. The prices in
these peasant markets, where the goods
Sold are surplus, are much higher than in
the government-regulated markets where
the typical Soviet citizen shops, The
Kaisers, because they could afford to,
were able to shop here and enjoyed many
foodstuffs they had at home,

The problems of the
homeless, the unemployed
and the intensely poor are
virtually nonexistent
when compared to these
problems in the

United States.

Kaiser said that another difference in
the standard of living between the typical
Soviet and American was illustrated in a
scrapbook he and his wiie had compiled to
help their children remember home. The
pictures of their house in Grinnell, the
children 5 toys, and the Kaiser s personal
possessions showed the differences bet
ween what the average American and
Soviet owns.

Kaiser said, “I can give a few
generalizations about the Soviets that are
comfy, and then i sort of complicate things
by saying ‘Yes mat is true, but "For
example it is necessary to realize that in
Soviet society, while the standard oi living
is lower, everyone has something

The problems of the homeless, the
unemployed, and the intensely poor are
virtually nonexistent when compared to
these problems in the United States.
Soviets are very proud oi this fact, and it is
easier to accept a lower general standard
oi living when no one is extremely wealthy
or extremely poor.

The differences in the lifestyles of the

Kaisers and their Soviet counterparts
often created a barrier for friendship bet-
ween the twoi Though Kaiser met many
Sovrets through his work and his research,
he found it difficult to become friends.

He also noticed a certain fear that holds
back many Soviets from becoming close
friends with an American. Kaiser said that
he met a young Soviet historian whose
work he admired, but who appeared to be:
afraid of being seen with him. The two
talked at the end of a deserted hallway,
and the man looked nervously about, as
though concerned someone would see him
conversing with an American.

' Kaiser said that he thought this was pro-
bably because the historian was afraid of
tainting his budding career with unsavory
relationships. However, he admitted that
established Soviet historians also seem unr
comfortable about being publicly
associated with him.

Kaiser expressed hopes that this iear
would eventually leave the Soviets and

that friendships between the two cultures ‘

would become possible, commenting. ”I
am
change, but am sceptical oi lasting
results.” There is freer speech in the
Soviet Union under Gorbachev, and other
freedoms are evident as well. The Soviet
people want to end the arms race, if only
because in a country so troubled by pover-
ty it would be economically sound.

Kaiser Said that it is necessary to
understand the differences between our
two countries, but not necessarily over-
come them, as many observers of the con
flicts between the Soviet Union and the
United States agree. There is no excuse for
our misunderstanding of these problems,
and this misunderstanding complicates
our entwined destinies.

it is important ior us to learn as much as
we can about our Soviet counterparts, but
as Kaiser said, “The general level of our
perceptions is so abysmal that no amount
of articles in the Scarlet and Black can br-
ing our understanding, and they [the
Soviets] unfortunately do not know us
either."
