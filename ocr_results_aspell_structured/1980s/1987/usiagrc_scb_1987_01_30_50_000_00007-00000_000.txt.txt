“Chair doth not a women’s
studies program make. ”

Dear Editor,

As one who was appalled to iind out that
this college feels that transporting
students to shopping malls is more impor-
tant than providing adequate women’s
health care i thank you for bringing atten
tion to this example of Grinnell’s insenr
sitivity to the needs of women (students,
staii, and faculty). Not only was this act a
slap in the face of all of those women who
have worked so hard to obtain some sort of
women’s health Care but as far as I know
was not even the result of any sort of stu7
dent demand. To be sure there has always
been a little grumbling about the isolation
of Grinnell, but why has the administra-
tion chosen to alleviate this problem by
providing shuttle service voluntarily while
at the same time denying transportation to
health clinics to those women who have
been asking for this service for years’.’ If
they can do one why not the other?

I feel compelled to point out to Mr. Har-
rison that although he is correct in noting

the college’s apparent commitment to
Women’s Studies (in the classroom only it
would seem) we do not as yet have a
Women’s Studies program We have an en-
dowed Chair, And a chair doth not a
women’s studies program make. AS yet we
do not have any faculty teaching a full
course load in Women’s Studies, What few
courses we do have devoted to the study of
women are not courses which have been
entered into me curriculum on a perma-
nent basis They are offered as speciality
courses which are likely to disappear when
the professor disappears. Since many of
these courses are presently taught by
visiting or partrtime faculty they may well
not be taught again.

Until this College realizes what a mature
commitment to Women’s Studies entails in
the curriculum, in hiring policy, and in
health care I am afraid we are bound to
see many more examples of the blatant
disregard for the needs of the women and
men of Grinnell. 7 Alison liaycs

Curriculum additions praised

To the Editor:
As we have all made it through the first

two weeks oi the term trying to jumble.

Class schedules. I think it is important for
the campus. especially the administration,
to recognize what is occurring this
semester. By some strange fluke of the
registrar or the curriculum council, there
.are at least 5 new or revitalized courses of
tered this semester that (all under the
disciplines of Women’s Studies or Afros
American Studies: Afro-American
History. Women in Western Society.
Topics in American Culture: Black
Women in America. Poetry oi Harlem
Renaissance. and Autobiographical Acts:
Women Writing Women. Grinnell students
have responded overwhelmingly to these
courses. so much so that their enrollment
now rivals that Of some of the introductory
science classes. and one professor pleaded
ior people to drop her course so the class
size would be small enough to be workable,

I hope that the iaculty and administra

tion are watching carefully 7 this kind oi
student response clearly indicates an imr
portani campus need that has not been sufr
ficiently recognized or met in the past. i
hope that the scheduling oi these courses
was NOT a 'fluke, but that it was Well-
planned and intentional. This remains to
be seeli. The college must make both the
ethical and financial commitment to the
continuation of Women's Studies and Afros
American Studies at Grinnell by offering
these types of courses as complementary
and supplementary to the “traditional"
curriculum. These courses are not just for
blacks or women. and they certainly
should not be viewed as temporary fads 7
they are viable. essential subjects and
ALL students must have the opportunity to
benefit from studying these areas.

The message is loud and clear: the
students want these course. and the col-
lege msut give full suppo t to these
academic disciplines, 7 Le Wilson '81

High school drug coverage

appreciated

To the Editor:

I want to give a public ‘lhank you’ for the
recent article as well as one in October in
the $84; on the alcohol and drug problems
at the Grinnell nigh School. Also, many
townspeople who are parents in the school
district appreciated the report and survey
done by some college students in regard to
H,S, intake of alcohol and drugs. Hopefuls
1y. all the publicity by both the SM; and the

Grinnell HeraldrRegister will help open up
some closed minds in denial 7 we do have
a problcml

Grinnell College is somewhat like a
“country" all its own within a rural
American small town. i was and am pleas-
ed with the study and articles as it shows
you care about us and our lives.

Again, thank you! 7 Mary iinworth, RN

Student Blasts Editor’s
Stand on Mall Shuttle

Dear Editor,

In the January 23. 1987 issue of the
Scarlet and Black an editorial was written
in reference to the weekend shuttles to Des
Moines that have been recently introducr
ed, The shuttle will travel to Des Moines
three times every weekend, Friday and
Saturday evenings and Saturday during
the day, The argument that was raised in
the editorial of question is that Grinnell
College is ignoring the medical needs of
iemale students by scheduling a shuttle to
Des Moines for the general use of all
Students rather than a shuttle to Mar-
shalltown for the specific use of female
students in Search of health care, This.
however, is not the case

The creator oi this editiorial is obviously
confused. Due to the absurdity of the ace
cusations presented. it is obvious that “the
creator" who constructed this piece of
journalistic debris did not research this
situation before writing the editorial. If
proper journalistic research had been con»
ducted, then the editorial would not have
consisted of so many instances of blatant
ignorance,

“The creator’s" ignorance was of some
beneiit though, It encouraged me to do my
own research, and to attempt to show the
students oi Grinneii College the portion of
the editorial that “the creator” neglected
to write After researching this situation
properly, I spoke to Jim Tederman, Vice-
president of the College and Dean oi Stu-
dent Affairs, 1 found a couple of bits of in-
formation that ”the creator" of the
editorial would find interesting.

The first bit of information that the
creator would [ind interesting is that the
shuttle trips to Des Moines, although of-
fered by the Student Affairs Office, were
requested for by the SGA. The SGA
speciiicaliy asked Student Affairs to
organize shuttle trips to Des Moines. There
was no conscious decision between a shut-
tle to Des Moines and a shuttle to Mar-
shalltown. The Student Affairs Office
merely responded to the request oi the
SGA. Student Affairs, therefore, cannot be
at fault in this situation,

The next hit of information that “the
creator” would find interesting is that the
shuttle was not planned exclusively to go
to the Merle Hay Shopping Mall or the
Civic Center. Both of these places were
selected as drop off points due to their cen~
trality in the city. This centrality allows
those students who make use of the Shuttle
to use public transportation to travel to
specific places in Des Moines that are not
within walking distance of either drop off
point. This means that the College's
students have access to almost any point in
Des Moines, including Flamed Paren-

thood. Family Planning, or even a
gynecologist,

Another bit of information, for those
iemale students who insist on going to
Marshalltown for health care, is that the
College does offer a means oi transporta-
tion for medical care outside of the town on
Grinneii Ii you are looking for a iree ride
than you are out oi luck-The College pro»
vides in town medical transportation to all
students. The cost of this transportation is
included in the cost of tuition, The College
does not provide iree, or prepaid,
transportation outside of Grinnell, but it
does offer a means of transportation at a
very minimal cost. Any student, male or
female, who wishes to receive medical
care outside of Grinnell can rent a car
from the College through the Student Afs
fairs Office. The student needs only to
speak to one person in the Student Affairs
Office, Oda Callsion, the office’s Ad~
ministrative Assistant. Asking only to
know what town and medical institution
the student will be traveling to, Ms Call-
ston will make arrangements with the
physical plant tor the student to use one at
the College’s cars.

At the minisuie cost of 17 (39an per mile.
any student can acquire this type of
transportation for medical purposes. The
student is responsible for the driving. If
the student is considered an eligible driver
by the College then he or she may drive
him or herself. If the student is not an eligir
ble driver then he or she is responsible for
finding an eligible driver, Student Affairs
can arrange for a driver, but this will Cost
an additional $3.50 per hour. If the student
does not hire a driver then a trip to Mar-
shalltown costs about twelve dollars. If a
group oi students rents the cartogether, at
the same cost per mile, then they can split
the cost among themselves,

“The creator” seems upset that there is
no shuttle going to Marshalltown for the
specific use of female students in Search of
women's health care. This has been at-
tempted before. While many students said
they would use the shuttle, in reality very
few students did, The cost of providing this
form of transportation became too high.
due mostly to the lack of use. This, in fact.
occurred a number of years ago. More
recently, a survey was taken last spring,
and its results indicated that there was in
terest in a shuttle. But when interested
females were asked to attend a meeting at
the Health Center to discuss this topic,
none oi them were present. The Student
Affairs Office took this as an indication
that there was no sincere interest among
the female members of the student body in
a shuttle traveling to Marshalltown. . . .
