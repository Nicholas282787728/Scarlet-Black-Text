Darby

by Grant Ehrlich

In a nearsmilitant action late last
week, CDCZptains Jesicca Tolt and
Joanne Saccet led their team to a
victorious battle to capture Darby
for this season’s home matches.

. ”This IS our new home.” Tait
declared, ‘This is where real
volleyball is to be played.” Inspir-
ing Taft to make the exodus [ruin
the PEG are the unity and
coherence of this year’s team.

“If we reach our goal ol playing
as a team, we will he
insurmountable," Tort said,

A true test of their abilities will
occur this Saturday at noon when
our ladiﬁ in white will host
Division-ll William Penn. This
match, possibly the toughest one at
the season, is expected to be a
sellout.

Gearing up for Saturday's match
are such all-time greats as digger,
Julie Hutton and hitter Amy Crawl.
Rumor has it that Crowl, with a
52inch vertical leap, may be
sidelined by the NCAA for ex-
cessive athletic brilliance in
DivisonsIII play. However, as this
is a nonconfererlce match, that
ruling may not hold.

“This year we want to concen-
trate on discipline, honor, and
especially pride: pride in our team
and pride in oumlm. i think that’s
one area in which we could imr
prove on irom last year," stated
cocaptain Greg Evans. A root in-
jury sidelined Evans during last
springs track season, but so iar
this year he has looked better than
ever in practice and may have an
excellent chance at repeating as
conierence champion and possibly

qualiiying {or the NCAA nationals
as an individual.

An area in which the Grim-tell
teams place special emphasis is
teamwork. Diiiicult practices are
meant to prove to the runners that

they can accomplish more than
they ever dreamed possible it they
work together, encouraging and
supporting their teammates rather
than competing against one
another. Having [un during
workouts is another essential ele
ment to the team’s success.

With 31 runners out {or the team,
Grinnell unquestionably has the
best depth in the Midwest Con-
ference, and competition {or the
top eight positions on the team will
be intense. The team is now train
ing exhaustively, holding morning
practices in the pool two days per
week in addition to normal alter-
noon running practices. While it
may Seem unusual [or a cross-

country team to practice in a pool,
the water workouts allow addi-
tional conditioning without the risk
oi injury that comes irom running
extra mileage. The volume oi
training will be decreased toward
the end oi the season in prepares
tion ior important races.

in addition to the conlerence and
NCAA regional meets, our own Les
Duke invitational will be an
especially meaningtul race tor this
year’s team. The season will begin
with the Cornell Ram Run on
September i2. Meets to he held at
Grinnell include the Les Duke in-
vitational on September 25 and the
Midwest Conicrenoe Champion
ships on November 7.

Senior Dorothy
Shearn, who placed eighth at con-
ference in 1986, and freshman
Katherine Fairbanks are expected
to be among the leading runners in
the conlerencc. Among the 19 rurr
ners on this year s team are many
inexperienced runners with great
potential. At least Seven should do
really well, according to Coach
Freeman, but it is difficult to make
predictions since the team has yet
to run a race.

The season will begin on
September 12 at Cornell. The
team s objectives in the early
season will be to work on even pac-
ing for the three-mile race,
distance, conditioning, running
together as a team. and providing
the new runners with the feel {or
cnmpetition. The overall place
ment of the team in early meets
will not be emphasized. Key meets
will be the Les Duke Invitational at
Grinnell September 26, and the
Midwest Conference Championr
ships on November 7, also to he
held at Grinnell. Improving on
their nth-place finish at the 1986
NCAA Division III Regional meet
will be another goal.
