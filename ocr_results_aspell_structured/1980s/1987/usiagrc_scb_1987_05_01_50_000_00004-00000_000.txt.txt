Ruthless People

by Brian Strause

“We've got to be ruthless. Think
ruthless It's good for you. ll makes you
strong. What's the sense of being a decent
person when nobody else is? Let's be
assholes and get rich." says the kidnapper
tJudge Reinhold) to his Wife tHelen
Slater), the real Spandex Mini-Skirt
Queen. Certainly this philosophy is
justified and should certainly be put into
practice on the basis that Danny Devito, a
sleazy midget \Vltl'i the devious mind oi a
child who straps Mrllos to the backs of box
turtles, became a millionaire by stealing
their plans for a line oi women's sports
wear. ,

‘ The ripped—off couple attempt revenge
by kidnapping DeVito's wife. played by
Bette Midler, Their demand for a ransom
is laughed at by DeVlto. as their promise

to kill DeVito’s wire only facilitates his
plans to do the same, DeVitp wants his

woman a notch slimier than himseli The
mistress, however, has plans to blackmail
DeVito once he kills his wife, so that she
and her lover, a failed Don Johnson clone.
can live out their years in luxury.

As can be expected, the plot twists trom
here to there and everywhere in between.
Don't despair. though, the story line is not
so complicated that a mind diluted by the
poisons oi alcbhol could not easily com-
prehend the proceedings with amazing ac-
curacy. So be ruthless and drink yourselt

soiial obsession iiitli the grotesque Like

The film is Conducted similarly. The
dialogue is purposely insipid. at one point

does there have to be people like Frank in

Dorothy at night. For much of the film,
Sandy and Jeff hope tor the “return of the

when all is said and done, it holds an insect
