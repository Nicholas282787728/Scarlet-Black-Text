The human
element

The sun was midway high in
the eastern sky, The holc was
dug.

1 round the urge to thrust
my arm down deep, into the
loose, cool soil. I pulled my
hand back out, palm cup ed,
ringers sli htly parted, siting
moist eart between them. The
air was still. My neck burned.
reddening slowly.

I sprinkled peat moss and
bone meal throughout, then
stood the juni er upright. It
leaued to one siiie. lscraped dirt
from the edge with my free hand
and adjusted it. Good.

Rocking back on my heels, I
felt u quiet satisfaction in platit-
ing the tree. In its roots and
branches would grow an exteri-
sion of me, spreading with it,
reaching to the sky.

Across the street, the mail-
box exploded. Screamcd laugh-
ter followed the ﬁve boys as they
sprinted through-trout lawns,
hurtling hedges and trampling
ﬂower beds.

Tire remains of the corner
mailbox belclled smoke.
Tongues of name lanccd from
within the aping mouth, scat.
terin line ﬁends of U5. postal
ash. he hinged jaw hung loose.

The pranksters whoopcd their
way around the corner and were
gone.

I watched the mailbox burn.
There was little that I could do;
the garden hose wouldn’t reach
that far.

The trucks arrived minutes

later, rollowed shortly by a pa-
trol car. The hremen doused
th ese or burning letters, blis-
tering paint, and warped metal
with hand extinguishers. The
crowd otcurious neighbors that
had gathered began to disperse
as the exeitelnent died oir.

The cop’s radio burst into life
with its rasp of static air, rol-
lowed by the bored voice of the
dispatcher. “Gotta o," the of-
hcer said, shaking iiands with
one or the hremcn. He turned
smartly on his heel and started
for his vehicle.

“Hey, Pete!“ The tireman cal.
led across the road while strug-

ling out of his bulky tire gear.
Srhc policeman turned, “You re.
member tivc, maybe six years
ago when that mailbox blew all
to hell over on the corner of
Piikin and Robertson Street?"

“Yeah?" the ofﬁcer said, still
edging awa . uwhat about it?"

Oh, notiiii But you otta
\vonder....” Tlle ﬁreman srook
his head and shrugged. The
policeman stepped to his ear,
started up, and waved as he
pulled away.

I went back to my work in
the trout yard. The shovel bit
in hard. 1 stomped on the
blade with the heel of my boot
and Icverecl back on the llnndle‘.
The thumb on my right work

love chated noticeably. About
halfway down the hole, I paused,
wiped my brow, and leaned on
the shovel handle. The sun
was directly overhead. I smiled
through the sweat and heat,
suddenly thinking that it was
better for guys to grow from
blowiu up mailboxes...

To pionting trees.

 

So this the Pub-c-or a
marginal facsimile

thereof

The Pub has once again
opened (or business. That is, of
course, a lie, but any good prof
will tell you that an essay should
have a 'stinctive o ening line.
I‘ll attribute this fallacy to the
mythical idea of “Journalists
License."

As most of you know, what
was once The Pub has reopened
under the name of Hector’s. It
was named after that cheer
ful kidney beau—shaped thing (I
guess it's a dog) that riddled the
walls of the Burlin men's room
until [I‘ll take a wi (I stab at the
number) two 8&6 guys struck
with the white paint. Hector's
relationship with the students of
Grinnell has been a love-hate afr
(air, but it should be pointed out
that the decision to name the
Pub area after him was mode
as a result or an informal poll
taken one day last semester in
thc Grill. obviously, not too
many people voted, but since
the daytime crowd at the Grill

and thererore is the most ac.
curate means or communication
that exists. Hence the phrase:
a picture is worth a thousand
words.

Recentl . however, it has been
proven tint a picture, with
the aid or a supecdnper rel-
atively inexpensive computer,
can lie. National Geo ru hic a
cew months ago found use i in a

, crisis situation. Their photogra-
phers had taken a picture of two
or the above pyramids with the
intention ofpntting them on the
front cover. When they returned
to their othce in the v.5, they
realized the pyramids were too
far apart for both to ﬁt on the
cover, and it they reduced the
picture the pyramids would look
too small. What did the editors
do? They put the photogra h
into a computer and moved I e
pyramids c oser together. When

they were done both pyramids
tit. They were closer to cthcr
than in reality, but that idn't
matter. The crisis had been
neatl solved.

Roling Stone had a diﬂ'erent
problem In one of its pic-
tures an actor had posed with
a gun in his hand. The ed-
itor of Rolling Stone, an ac-
tive unvcantxol advocate, de-
clereci at the last minute that
the picture couldn't be printed
with the nu. The photograph
was placeci into a computer simr
ilar to National Geographic‘s,
and the Iln was very carefully
erased. There was no evidence
left that it ever existed. This cri-
sis had been neatly solved, too.

Before you throw down this
article in disgust at such'kriv-
ial criticisms, please understand
I am not condemnin the above
two magaciues. T ere is ale
ways a ﬁne line between what is
IIIOIaIIy ethical and what is not,
but I think these two incidents
fail on the favorable side. On
the other hand, 1 do worry about
this ﬁne line in the future and
what this new technolo y may
have. in store for us. I a gun
can be taken awa from a pin
ture, can it be ad edY Can one

take a icture otsomebody leav-
ing a tank, later put a gun in
the person's hand, and claim he
robbed it?

I can imagine that the Na-
tional Enquirer and other sim-

ilar ma amines are quite excited
about t is new technolo y. Up
until now they have lied to
rely on trick photography to get
their strange and bizarre pic-
tures. perhaps some might con—
sider this just a new trick, but
its power greatly exceeds that
of any or its predecessors. an.
tire pictures can be rearranged
and altered at the tenth of but-
tons, without leaving any ev—
idence that it has been done.
The process simply changes the
Bhotograph into a series of num—
era, and ii the programmer
knows what the numbers mean“
an entire new picture can be cre-
ated. Presently. simple alter.
ations are the easiest, but the
future will brin more advanced
models that wil be able to do
more advanced jobs.

What pictures will tutnrc po»
litical demagogues be able to
coninre ortheir opponents? Thisl
technology could have etrects
on all levels of society: media,
advertisin , politics, and busi~
ncss. Wil you ever again have
the com lete ruith you used to
have in tire accuracy of pictures?
How many words is a picture

This brings me to the problem.
it looks as it a rcvolt against

because I work at Hector's. Now
I'm hardly entrepreneurial (after
all, 1 am an anthro major], but
no customers at Hector‘s means
no job tor inc and seven others.
And as my golden—tressed roonr

quite the same prophetic punch
in the corutields as it might at
UC Stateschool. The prices on
Tombstones have risen, true, but
they’re still cheaper than they
are in town (a pox on Food 4
Less), and we cook them for
you, It's also cheaper to bring
your own beer, and nlost under»
classmen can’t drink in the bars
anyway. Please forgive me, {sir
low upperclassmcn, for opening
my arms to them in such a bla-
tantly avaricious manner. But,
as I suspect some of the seniors
are already realizing, a hnck’s a
buck.

In addition to selling soft
drinks, we are considerin the
sale of candy, chips, an caf~
fee. The cheese for the nachos
should be in soon. There are
video arues, a pool table, and a
(oosbal table which has a li ht
almost directly over it. ut
we know its not the real Pub.
We're not trying to outdo the
old Pub (For the record, nothv
ing could ever hope to outdo The
Pub). But it is a good place to
go and relax in a social atmo-
sphere, something Griunelliaus
siould spend more time doing,
But then, that‘s a topic for ans
other time.
