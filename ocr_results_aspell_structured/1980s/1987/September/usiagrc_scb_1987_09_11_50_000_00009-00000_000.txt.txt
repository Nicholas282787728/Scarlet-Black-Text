Rock North Lounge

by Leii Larsen

A swirnrning maelstrom oi
rock and roll wrecklessly car
reens down the tree-lined boule-
vards oisouth Minneapolis. The
gassengers variously gulp G.

mains in their memory oi “Hot

and fight over the FM. diet. In
the trunk a case oi Preiirer long-
necks begs redemption. The
only destination in mind is tinre.
tirne to ﬁnish the beers.

Born in the rind—sixties, conre
oiage in. gulp. the rnid.seventies-.
these guys are giving their best
shot at dulthood in the eight-
ies. And what's it all about?
With a life of Mary Richards and
Spiro Agnew. Alice Cooper and

Elton John. Cheech and (:hong
and Clint Eastwood; what's a
poor boy to do? vote republie

So you form an all-out on-
slau ht of a Rock and Roll
Bans, stop cutting your hair.

linin the corner bar and getting
coluglimelltary drinks. Catch in
few ears and if you‘re lucky you
might even cut a record or two -
if on don’t crash ﬁrst.

goul Asylum is just such a
band.

Spinning, drunken. glorious;
these guys are smitten with
Rock and Roll and all that goes
with it. Stardom is spit upon
and reserve is thrown to the
wind in the ﬁnest ’77 spirit;
left behind is ‘77’s llleasured
nihilism. Their repertoire (le-
lines their generotton: “Play
That Bulky Music." “Jukebox
Hero,“ “Paradise By the Dash-
board Light." and “Freehird” -
tllis is the subtext to American
society in the ‘80s

Dave Pirner {singer/guitarist.)
says it best: ‘Sollnds like just
another {uckin’ rock 'n‘ roll band
to me!" It‘s about time!

“First Light” among best books of 1987

By Todd Francis

The ﬁrst thing that a reader
will notice about Charles Bax-
ter's new book, “First Li llt."
is that it consists of one ashr

comes apparent that the overrid-
ing structure is actually one that
ﬂows backward: “First Light"
begins with the most current
events and progressively reveals

is tracked backward through
