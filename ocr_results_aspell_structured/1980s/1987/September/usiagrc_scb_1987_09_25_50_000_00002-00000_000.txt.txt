Native American Conference

Indians fight To retain land

by Steven Hingtgen

“We need the mountain to live."

iKee Shey, a Navajo herder

Native Americans have never
been a high priority in our white-
ruled society. Almost everyone
would agree'that historically we
have destroyed lndian culture and
violated lndian rights at every cone
ceivable point since ﬂ'ie first Euro-
peans came to North America. But
today the assault continues all
across the country. and it receives
less attention as a contemporary
shame than it does as a historical
fact. One of these current
tragedies is the Hopi-Navajo, or
Big Mountain, dispute.

in lbsz, an Executive Order
granted the Hopi tribe a reservar
tion in What is now northeastern
Arizona. Fourteen years earlier.
the Navajo had been granted a
reservation overlapping the
Arizona-New Mexico border. Over
time, the nomadic, sheeprherding
Navajo increased their numbers
tenlold, expanded their reserva-
tion to surround the sedentary
Hopis, and even moved inside the
liopi reservation.

Then. in the early part of this
century, some “entrepreneurial"
Hopis tor the iirst time began to
abandon their gardens and take up
large herds oi livestock The
resulting competition over range
land led to clashes between the
Hopi and Navajo over rights to the
land. and in the 19405 the Hopi
Tribal Council began a push to
remove the Navajos from the 1882
reservation.

In 1958, the U District Court Di
Arizona determ ed in Healing v.
Jones that the Navajo and Hopi
”have a joint, undivided and equal
interest in and to all the 1882 reser~
vation.” with the exception of the
south-central mesas where the
Hopi villages are concentrated.
The shared area is called the Joint
Use Area (JUA) and includes Big
Mountain. Since the JUA was little
used by the Hopi, it remained a
range land ior the Navajo sheep

.. l ‘
1974 Settlement Act is to solve the
long~lasting disagreement between
the Hopi and the Navajo.
Goldwater and supporters of the
bill pointed to the the violence bet-
ween the two tribes over the Joint
Use Area. The “land dispute.”
they said, needed to be solved by
separating the two groups.

Critics suggest that the true
motivation behind the govern-
ment's action is that in the
1940s.the only coal reserves in
Arizona were discovered on Big
Mountain. in addition, the attorney
who represented the Hopi Tribal
Council. John Boyden, worked for
a law firm which also represented
the Peabody Coal Company.

insensitivity, and neglect are the
keynotes of the federal government’s
interaction with traditional Indian
religions and culture’

 

herders who neither understood
nor cared about the new ruling.

But in 1974. alter continuous
pressure irom the Hopi Tribal
Council. a group oi senators in
cluding Arizona Senator Barry
Goldwater introduced legislation
called the Settlement Act (Public
Law 93531), which provided lor
the division oi the LE million-acre
JUA into separate enclaves ior the
licpi and Navajo tribes. Members
oi each tribe who lived on land ap~
portioncd to the other one would be
required to move, This primarily
involved the relocation oi 10.000 to
12.000 Navajos out oi the Hopi
areas, and the eviction oi the Big
Mountain Navajos To this day. the
order has not been completely car-
ried out, but the government can
tinues to pressure the Navajos to
move, and it .continues to build
iences that prevent the people
irom returning to their land.

The issue is complex and cons
troversial. The stated intent oi the

Peabody Coal was. in lact, the
principal lobbyist behind the Set»
tlement Act. And by 1974, uranium
deposits had also been discovered
on the Mountain. Eviction oi the
Big Mountain people would ex-
pedite the eiiorts oi the mining
companies to obtain leases on the
emptied territory.

The problem is that the lndians
do not want to move Those who
live on Big Mountain are the most
traditional lnoiaiis remaining in
the country. Most oi these people
have lived there all their lives and
depend on the open range to raise
their sheep. Additionally, much oi
the area is sacred to the Navajo
Big Mountain is central to the
origin myth and religion at the peer
pie, Anthropologists have idenr
tiiied at least 15 locations which
are “holy" to the Navajo, in-
cluding the traditional home oi
Begnchldi, the"0ne Who Created
Man " The Navajo go to the
spiritual places to pray and to col-

lect medicinal herbs They per-
iorm ceremonies there. and it is a
link to their ancestors. The manna
tain is alive to the people. and ior
many. to relocate would be to leave
liie. A Navajo chant describes the
land‘s importance:

The mountains. i become
part oi it...

The herbs, the evergreen, i
become part oi it.

The morning mists, the
clouds. the gathering
waters,

1 become part oi it.

The dew drop, the pollen, i
become part oi it.

The land is so important that the
physical and mental health oi the
Navajos have started to reilect this
devastating attack on their
culture. The lndian Health Service
reports that those Navajos who
lace relocation are “currently
utilizing the mental health
iacilities oi one oi the lHS
[centers] at a rate which is eight
times greater than that ol Navajos
who will not be relocated,”
Another report states that 25 per
cent oi the first group oi Navajo
adults who were relocated died
within six years.

Since 1982, the situation has im-
proved slightly The leader oi the
whitebacked Hopi Tribal Council.
which has continued to push ior the
relocation, was iorced out oi oilice.
The new leader has pledged
cooperation with the Navajos in all
areas and has agreed to drop all
legal action over the land. Finally.
both sides are working together
against the federal government
and the utility companies. They
have recognized the real enemy.

while the Big Mountain land
dispute is perhaps the single
greatest assault on Native
Americans land right today. it is
iar irom unique. Land disputes arc
iound allover the country. and
they are receiving almost no atten-
tion. The current administration is
