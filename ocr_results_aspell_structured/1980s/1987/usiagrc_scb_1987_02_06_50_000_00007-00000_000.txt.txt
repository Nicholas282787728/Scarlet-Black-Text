Feb. 6, win

To the Editor,

While reading the SCARLET AND
BLACK last Friday I came across a bit of
news that has leit me simply dumbfound»
ed. In order to attract black students, ad-
missions counselor Floyd Akins has plans
of launching a television campaign to pro-
mote our fair school. At first when I read
these plans, i thought that perhaps I was
reading the gag issue or that maybe I was
just hallucinating. Seriously, i thought to
myself, Grinnell College has a reputation
for academic excellence. This school is
consistently recognized as one of the
greatest liberal arts institutions in the
country. why throw away whatever
reputation ﬂiis college has so feverishly
acquired with an ad campaign?

Whenever I think of education and
television Commercials, images of high
school dropouts banging out dents on splatr
tered Chevys come to mind. The com-iota»
tions of any school that is recognized by
the phrase “as seen on TV” add up to
disgrace and embarassment. ii the college
truly wants to make a laughingstock of
itself, this path would be the one to follow. I
can just see myseli trying to get a job
someday. As the interviewer examines my
resume he says, “Oh, I see here you went
to Grinnell (chuckle). Seriously, you got
your diploma irom that ad on MTV, didn‘t

you? Where the hell is Iowa anyway?"

Don’t get me wrong, it's great that the
college wants to increase its black popula-
tion; but Akins‘; comment, ”We Want
black students and will do anything to get
them here,” borders on stupidity. Perhaps
the next step in the advertising campaign
should be ads on bubble gum wrappers or
bus stop benches. Applications could be in
Cluded with Run DMC albums. Hey, we’ll
do anything. Might as well give a scholar-
ship to the 100th application that comes in
each month.

It seems that the administration has lost
sight oi its goal to attract quality students.
First they concoct a slick ”Miami Vice”
logo (at true reﬂection of the college’s
heritage) and now they have plans to have
“Grinnell” spoken in the same breaU'l as
vocational schools and community col»
leges. We are moving backwards in evolur
tlon.

When people ask me where i go to school
lalready have a hard enough time explain
ing just what this school is all about. Just
how reliable are the Statistics that make
Grinnell acceptable in the outside world’s

Personality Profile disliked

To The Editor.
. in his “personality profile." Mr. Steup is
proclaimed a "man oi big thoughts, yet
tew words." lshouldn't wonder. ii 1 were a
man oi big thoughts I too would be leery oi
wasting many words answering the bor.
ing, hackneyed questions which were put
to Mr. Steup. No doubt it is a worthwhile
endeavor to attempt to provide insight into
the people who are professors at Grinllell;
however. Ms. Gettel's questions would
seem to indicate either that she could not

be bothered to hnd out something oi Mr.
Steup's background in advance, thus pro.
viding material ior a more intercsting in-
terview. or she is suiiering under the gross
misapprehension that the students oi Grin
ncll will think themselves ediiicd upon
reading the answers to her stock oi high
school journalism class quesitons. indeed,
Mr. Steup is to be commended ior having
withstood any temptation to give
pedagogically-minded high school
teachers answers. 7 Williiiln ll. Turner

 

Townsporson speaks out on
American Pictures

To the Editor,

As a non-college student irom the Grin»
iiell community. I thought you might be in-
terested in a different perspective on the
iilm. "An American Pictures" that I view-
ed talong with a packed house oi college
studentsl last Sunday night in Robert‘s
Theatre.

I was very impressed with the
photography. and with most oi the iirst
half on rural poverty. it was truly a glimp-
se into a liie I haven't personally seen a lot
oi nor would want to ior very long!

My objections to this presentation were
in the highly subjective. sermon-like at.
titudes presented. and With other extremes
1 would like to point out.

One question I have is how did this sell.
proclaimed vagabond irom Denmark hapr
pen to be in a position to be taking pictures
oi so many beautiiul. nude. black women?
Women he lived with for l. 2. or 3 months
at a time? You figure it out

As a caucasion observer. 1 got quiteuired
oi seeing the photographer portrayed as
the only dccent white human left in the
world,

”Poor. white trash.” were viewed as be-
ing unjustiiiably prejudiced against poor
blacks. even though they are in direct com»
petition with them ior jobs, housing. etc.

Rich whites were seen as un-ieeling
liberals that perpetuate the system. When
this phony. manipulator appeared at their
door. with short wig on. would they have
let him in ii they had known he was going
to put them down and degrade everything

they stand for?
when our “nice photographer” ap-
poured on an urban street and a i'rugglng
attempt was made; what did he say or do
‘to get invited home by this duo instead?

What did a ”nice" white man do to get
allowed into a shooting gallery in the city
to take photos oi black men shooting up7
You decide,

1 can understand his appreciation oi
black culture and black way of life. He has
asstmilated himself Il’ltD it so much that he
may have forgotten one thing: He still
looks pretty white to me!

He used reverse prejudice by showing a
fun. black church. iollowed by pictures oi
some stiffrlipped white church-goers
holding a collection plate.

in tact. he was the only white person in
the whole movie worth a hill of beans‘l

it was apparent that he had a romantic
relationship wilh the lady who lived in a
shock that he goes to see on vacations. She
now is in a better shack with running water
and electricity.

A truly assimilated white man in the
black community who really loved a black
woman could surely do better ior her than
a nicer shack.

Finally. I deeply resented being told
what my reactions to this film would be in
a typed list that appeared on the screen.

I hope to demonstrate through this
editorial that my viewpoint was not one oi

On Women’s Health Care

Dear Editor,

I wanted to offer a few clarifications in
response to the letter to the editor on the
mall shuttle last week. It is a great idea for
the college to set up a shuttle to go to the
malls. Certainly, this shuttle helps to
alleviate some difficulties posed by Grin-
nell's location. The problem to which “the
creator" referred was not. as Mr. Fields
mistakenly assumed, that people thought
the college had chosen to schedule a shut~
tie to malls instead of one to health care
clinics, Rather, the indignation and
distress stemmed from the fact that
women have been denied access to
gynecological health care ior so many
years, despite irequent request ior
something as minimal as a regularly
scheduled shuttle to a clinic, and yet the
request for the mall shuttle was so easily
granted.

Another point I would like to address
here is the “minimal cost” involved in ren-
ting a Car from Student Affirs, Mr. Field,
did you know that to go to lowa _City.

estimating a distance of about 70 miles, it
would cost a student $23.80 round trip? If
the student needed a driver it would cost
the student at least an additional $14.00
because she would spend approximately
three hours driving and-at the very least
one hour in the oiiice, though more likely it
would take one-and-a-halt to two hours
there. So, the cost of transportation would
be at the very least $37.80 without in-
cluding the cost oi one exam or any
medication. Is this truly minlscule? One
could rent a car wiﬂl other students, but
who has time to organize a trip'.’ Who can
spare the additional time that would he
spent waiting in the office? Most students
would have a hard time sparing four, let
alone five or six, hours irom an aiternoon.
Even ii a shuttle were set up, students
would have difficulty allocating that much .
time, Nor would a shuttle benefit faculty or
staff members. Gynecological care is not a
irivolous request but rather a iundamental
necessity to which the college must attend.
