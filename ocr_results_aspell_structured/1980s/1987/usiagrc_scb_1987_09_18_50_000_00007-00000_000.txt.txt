Sept. 18, l987

Last Saturday night, a se-
lect group of Grinnellians got a
small taste of what the school
may have been like during the
late sixties. The progressiveff)
band “Soul Asylum” performed
behind Darby, playing a selec»
tion of both their own original
tunes as well as some covers
from more mainstream bands.
The music was extremely dance—
able (and slamrdancenble), and

the show was the third success-
ful one in three that have been
pat on behind Darby.

Problems arose, however,
when the Grinnell Police De-
partment received a series of
complaints from solne of the res
idents in the area. They stopped
by to request that the band turn
the volume down to comply with
the complaints. Whether or not
this was done is questionable.
Any volume change was cer-
tainly not discernible from my
vantage point, in the audience.

The police returned a short
time later, saying that there had
been additional complaints and
that they were thus forced to
close the show. At this point the
concert was almost 1 1/2 hours
old, which in my mind is the
bottom limit for an acceptable
concert'length. The band was
surely not far from wrapping it
up on their own. The crowd was
disappointed that the show was
being closed, and the presence
of the police drew some derisive
remarks from the students.

The crowd was slow to disc
perse, which was complicated by
the fact that Concer‘ts Commit-

tee Chair Leif Larsen had laryn~
gitis and could not ask the stur
dents to leave. So a certain stur
dent, apparently disappointed
at the early end to the show
(and perhaps at several other e1-
ernents of society), decided to
take it upon himself to climb
on stage and espouse some of
h‘s philosophies. These beliefs
had a decidedly anarchistic ﬂap
var, and the results of his speech
were the crowd's increased un-
willingness to leave and deﬁance

of the police.

1 spoke to the police almost
immediately after this. They
met the student offstage and
told him to go back and tell
the crowd to disperse, a task he
performed rather inadequately.
They said that they had re-
ceived no less than four com»
plaints from the townspeople
and that they actually had the
authority to close the show afc
ter the second complaint. so we
were allowed to, continue with
the show longer than was nec-
essary, and at its close the stu-
dents exhibited a rather ems
barrassing display of disrespect.
The enthpolice sentiments were
not the feelings of the entirc
crowd, but the officers I spoke
to expressed their anger at the
situation.

What we have to realize is
that paying our tuition to Grins
nell College permits us to go
to school here, not to receive
the run of the town. The peo
ple of Grinnell live here, we we
merely renting the privilege to
stay here while we complete our
education, and we must there»
fore live by their laws. I agree

Discrimination against
foreign students decried

To the Editor:

I feel total frustration when
looking at the circumstances
surrounding Grinnell‘s mens
varsity soccer team. I am not
one to voice feelings in a way
such as this. But, as a last re—
sort, 1 feel a need to express the
disappointment I feel.

Last year 1 was a J.V. player
and this year 1 continue to play
soccer, on the JV. team, be-
cause of time commitments.

It has been difﬁcult not to no-
tice, as I did last year, that
there were few if any foreign stuc
dents on the varsity team, al-
though there were many capa-
ble foreign players on J.V. It
was also hard not to notice a
coach who continually treated
these players in a different inan-
ner than he treated the Amer-
ican players, The coach’s cul-
tural slurs made about the for-
eign players’ names and home
countries, along with the indi»
vidual stereotypes, such as laci-
ness, slowness, and an unwill-
ingness to practice, were taken
lightheartedly at ﬁrst. But, as
the season progressed, l noticed
the negative affect of what these
slurs had on the. players and it
hurt me to see this going on,

As we approached the end of
the year we met in an orgar
nirational meeting for the year
ahead. Everything that 1 had
observed during the year spr-
faced in that meeting and I saw
it very clearly. And i didn’t like
it. Conch explained his hopes
for the upcoming season but also
added his policy toward foreign
students. it was to my surprise
that he actually had one and
was so willing to set it straight

Bork’s beliefs endanger our rights

1 am deeply worried and vary
scared. I hcar people on cam
pus and read letters to the edi-
tor in big-city newspapers ques-
tioning the Democratic uproar
against Supreme 'Court nomi-
nee Robert Bork. These peo-
ple don‘t understand the impor-
tance of a justice's individual
beliefs. They think that as long
as the y'udge is well-qualiﬁed, his.

beliefs don’t matter, since the
beliefs play no rule in the deci<
sious. However, this assumption
is wrong.

in this year of the Bicenten—
nial, it is important that people
understand what the Supreme
Court does. The Supreme
Court interprets the Constitu-
tion by deciding if speciﬁc laws
or lower-court decisions are coin
stitutional or not. Through
the interpretation, they set what
are called “precedences.” While
this may not be direct legis-
lation, it has the same effect.
That is, until it is overturned by
a future set ofjustices.

Many people would be‘ snr~

prised if they were told what
is presently not in the Consti-
tution but only embodied by
precedence that can easily be
overturned. Among the long list
of precedences appears the fa-
nlous Roe v. wade case involv—
ing the right to have an abor.
tion. as well as other privacy~
related issues. while support
ers of Bork claim he will ac.
cept precedence and not over-
turn past decisions, Bork hns ac-
tually only promised to stand by
precedences which he feels were
reached in a correct and proper“
manner. He has also made it
clear that the Roe v. Wade deck
sion does not belong under this
category. while Bork is not
against legalircd abortion, he is
against federal regulation. He
believes the decision is the sole
right of the state, and not ofthc
federal government.

He believes this not only with
regard to abortion, but also with
regard to all other privacy is
sues. While states‘ rights and
decentralization of power may
be generally good ideas, Bork
doesn’t realize that there are
some rights that have to be err
forced on a national basis. lfleft
lo the states, not every citizen
would be guaranteed of these

rights, In the conﬁnes of the
America which Bork seems to
hold as his ideal, some states
would be allowed to outlaw all
forms of relationships besides
heterosexual monogamous mar-
riages, while othcr states could
outlaw all forms besides homo-
sexual ones. The problcnrs with
this are obvious. While norc
nially the Constitution needs to
be amcnded to legislate these
rights, the country must be as
surcd of their privacy by a dire
ferent means until this occurs.

Bork may be a well-respected
judge, but it is equally impor-
tant for us to consider his be-
liefs. For any judge's interpre-
tation will be based on individ-
ual biases regardless of how un-v
biased the judge may claim‘ to
be. That that interpretation is
a very close synonym of opinion
cannot be denied.

Bork‘s beliefs could endanger
many rights that we hold door if
the nomination proves success—
ful. I am deeply worried that
the Senate Judiciary Committee
will not all stand behind Biden
and that Bork could actually be—
come a Supreme Courtjnstife. I
am scared for the future of our
nation if this happens.

before us.

Coach said a number of very
disturbing things. He told us
that he would not even “look
at" the foreign players for the
ﬁrst week and then, even after
that, would not consider them
for the Varsity team until they
could prove to him that they
could play “American” soccer.
He told us that he views the
foreign students as “lazy" and
“not willing to practice," and
while telling us this, he pointed
to one foreign student in partice
ular, saying that he represented
these qualities and continued to
harp on his country.

I have tried to understand the
coach’s policy. The coach‘s rea-
soning behind his policy of not
“looking at” foreign players dur-
ing the ﬁrst week of practice,
regardless of their abilities, was
that they needed time to ad.
just to their new surroundings.

This seems all wrong to me. 1‘

feel that all students, whether
foreign or American, should be
viewed equally from the ﬁrst day
on, so that they will each have
an equal chance of ﬁnding their
niche at Grinnell.

After realizing what Coach
was really saying in that meet
ing and the coach’s view towards
foreign players, I called him on
the telephone that evening. we
had a very heated discussion
about his policies, but to my
disappointment he said that he
would not change them. All that
resulted was a note of apology to
the team for his harmful states
rnents directed toward the {arc
eign players.

After talking to coach on the

phone, I was still shocked that
he held strong to his policy. I
looked for other alternatives 1
could take. 1 ended up call-
ing the director of athletics, who
was very surprised to hear about
all of this. She promised me that
she would look into it and that
things would not be the same in
the next season.

The next season is here, and
i realize that things have not
changed as she had promised.
Even though there is not as
nruch name calling going on,
Coach’s policy has not changed.
In fact, when I walked out on the
field the ﬁrst day, 1 saw some
thing else that made me feel
uncomfortable, i noticed that
there had not been enough of
the yellow team uniforms to go
around and that the only two
players given the extra blue uni-
forms to wear happened to be
the only two black players on
the team, Then, as l watched
the selection process for var-
sity, to my disgust, the foreign

students’ abilities were ignored
once again.

I am very frustrated. l have
talked to the coach as well as
his supervisor and now 1 write
this letter. 1 am afraid that the '
coach’s attitude towards foreign
students will continue. 1 hope
by bringing this to the atten'.
tion of the campus, that some.
how something can be done, It
just seems to me that a place
as open—minded as Grinnell Col-
lege wouldn’t have to deal with
a situation such as this.

KDIC policy criticized

Dear Editor:

My application for a radio
show on Kch was rejected.
When I found out that I did
not get a time slot, 1 inquired
as to the criteria that were
used by the selection commits
tce. l was surprised to hear that
no "eclectic” shows were choc
sen. This criterion was not ans
nounced at the station’s organi-
zational meeting on Sunday, Au»
gust 30,

It was announced, however,
that 1(ch encouraged its appli-
cants to plan shows with “tight
formats,” due to‘ recent com
plaints that disc. jockeys have
had a tendency to “play any»
thing and everything," as man
ager Wayne seamen put it. (See
KDIC article in sea, sept. 11.,
page 2.) 1 took this to mean that
applicants should plan carefully
the type of music they intended
to play on their shows. I did
that. I described an “eclectic
dance” show with “upbeat mu—
sic from a variety of eras.” This
was not acceptable. seaman
told me that irshows began with
an idea of variety, then they are
likely to “get out of hand" later
on.

I suppose, then, that eclectic
shows were not selected due to
their “loose format.” It seems
that applicants who had a cre-

ative approach to their shows
and who described their music
as “eclectic".(or perhaps even
those who did not use this “1)qu
zword") were eliminated. 'Ac-
cording to last week’s article,
none of the live applicants who
did this got time slots. Also, I
would not be surprised if oth-
ers who demonstrated some are
ativity in their applications were
excluded because they did not
have “tight formats."

in addition to the “tight fore
mat” that was asked for, sup-
posedly there was an “expert
ence" criterion as well. On
the application, a space is pro-
vided for applicants to include
any previous work on KDIC or
“other work experience.” It was
brought to my attention that
experience was no longer being
taken into consideration, and

yet applicants were given this
impression when filling out the
application. One applicant in-
dicated on her application that
she had taken an 8-week profes-
sional training session for disc
jockeys this past summer, Her
application was rejected, along
with others who had previous
experience on the air. ln the
ﬁnal analysis, relatively few exe
perienced disc jockeys got time
slots. The new lineup of disc
