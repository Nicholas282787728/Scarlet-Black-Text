Continues to research. Write pl'o-
lifically, and speak to audiences all

A recent book of his, entitled
“Fighting for Liie: Contest, SeXr

most relevant to the lecture he will
give at Grinnell. The book explores
the functions 01 contest in educa-
tion. sports, and politics with

Noun Chair Mary Lynn Brue

Most recently, Ong has written a
study oi the lsthcentury Jesuit
poet Gerard Manley Hopkins call~
ed “Hopkins, the Sell, and God,"
which deals with the poet's view of
individuality as tempered by Vic
torian and particularly Catholic
concerns that we recognize as
prematurely modern. His range oi
subject matter is wonderiully
broad. in 1982, he published a
volume called “Orality and
Literacy: The Technologizing of
the Word," which is concerned
with relatively new and
revolutionary work on "oralityr
literacy contrasts" in culture irom
