The lnhuman

First Impressions:

the death of an infant

How does one handle death" I've
been iortunate tor unfortunatcl in
that i've never been to a iuneral or
wake, The only person in my famir
ly to have died was my grand-

rmother, but i was eleven at the

Luc Hatlestad

time and l was never particularly
close to her. So i haven't yet had
the experience oi mourning a loved
one. i mention the word unioi's
tunate because I have this ever
present tear that I'm going to lose
those who are close to me all at one
time. I iigure that the longer l‘m
unexposed to that kind oi pain the
more diiiicult it will be to deal with
when it happens

Over break i received news that
another member or my iamily had
died Thiswasababy boy.sixmon-
ths old, who died in his crib, asleep
For the iirst time in my liie I'm
laced with questions I've asked
myseli beiore but iroin a position
removed irom the situation.
Although i am not religious, the
rest or my iamily is very Catholic.
The only thing I know ior certain
about the Catholic iaith is that I
don't want to be one Nothing
against Catholic people, but 1
simply don't agree with uhat i
know or their philosophy,

When i received the news oi my
cousin's death. I iound mysell says
ing repeatedly, ”God DAMN it."
This is a phrase which, among
other blasphemes, I've uttered
rather irequently in the past. But it
was the only one that i could iorce
out at the time. Does that mean
anything?

Perhaps it does. Despite my ige
norance oi religion and my seli~

given title oi "agnostic." i want to
believe that there is a benevolcnt
God and an aiterliie that is a
utopia ior all worthy oi admit
tanee. But it is the reactions oi
believers to a tragedy like the
death oi a child which causes my
skepticism. They say things like.
“God needed him in heaven"
What the hell does that mean”
These religions worship an om-
nipotent God and then turn around
and excuse his malevolence by
reasoning that he needs the help oi
an iniant l have a problem
understanding a theology which.
although based on almost come
pletely irrational tenets. attempts
to rationalize an unnatural "act oi
God" with a logical explanation.

The people who needed the help
oi this iniant are here on earth The
iirst child oi my aunt and uncle is
gone, shattering the dreams they
had ior him and probably damage
ing their willingness to have more
children. [Wouldn't ieel so strong-
ly ii I hadn't met the baby, but
because i did, i can honestly say
that l have never beiore seen a
child so absolutely adored by its
parents. The sparkle that this child
brought to their eyes brought Vir-
tual tears to mine. Their happiness
was indescribable.

The aitermath oi this whole
series oi incidents has leit me with
a disillusioned iceling oi mortality
1 think it is rather naive and imr
mature ior one to believe that one
is going to live iorever, but when
you're 20 years old, living each day
ior the next and building ior the
iuture, you hardly think oi death as
a serious threat. but l've sinned a
great deal in my liie and others a
great deal more, So why is it that
an innocent child (don't try to tell
me he wasn't innocentt lies dead
while the rest oi us go on with liie.

whim?

in a brilliant display of ﬂesh and

team continued a tradition, the
Naked Miid Loop. The Mud Loop,

is a favorite run, but this event,
The Naked Mud Loop. is special it
all started last Tuesday afternoon
innocently enough when Coach
Freeman sent the boys out on a

[Grant Ehrlich

regular eightvmiie run and told
them to hold the pace to 6:30 per
mile. Soon aiter they passed the
edge oi campus, the team ran by
some highschool girls, not women,
oi whom Mark Couch captured an
eyeiul. Faster than Batman or
Robin, Mark began to disrobe. The
team soon realized that this was
the day oi the Naked Mud Loop. By
the time they passed the high
school, their shorts were around
their necks and the pace had drop
ped to 6:15 per mile. A chuckle ran
throught the pack; Todd
Rowenkamp was wearing some
colored silk slinky things: I guess
there was contusion during the
ioreplay or postplay: you can't
blame the guy, Mike Jennings
deiinitely had the best Jock, strong
elastic supports with a red strand.

Soon they made the turn onto the
gravel road which led to the heart
oi the Mud Loop. it all came oii.
Flapping in the breeze they realiz~
ed the true calling that caused the
Greeks to create the olympic
Games. Mud spattered, clods ilew,
but the boys ilew on; with Couch in

 

the lead, the pace dropped to 6:00.

irom miles above he spotted what
he thought was a full moon, it turn

shiny, white display oi pride.

The upperclassmen were in awe-
freshmen were leading the Naked
Mud Loop, The run is tradition but
the grandiose periormance oi the
ireshmen was a new high in Grin-
nell cross country, The tradition
has its roots in cit-captains Andreo
McKcan and Jim Rasmussen, It
was they who brought the energy
of the R00 together But to give
credit where credit must be given,
it was "the Schwies," Paul

By now the team was on the
home stretch and really stretching
it out. At that pace there was a lot
oi heavy breathing, and latigue
started to set in, but they dropped
the pace, this time to 5:45. Mark

Coming home, the pace quicken
ed, this time to about 5‘30. It Just
felt good. said Dan Johnson of the
run. Eric Fuld only grinned, Back
inside the PEC, Coach Freeman
checked his watch twice, only able
to wonder what had happened that
day on the fabled Mud Loop.

 

Capital punishment :

When killing people is

A iew weeks ago, 1 attended a
speech here at Grinnell given by
the Socialist Party candidate ior
president Willa Kenoyer. A large
variety or buttons were being sold,

i one oiwhich borethe slogan “Why
do we kill people who kill people in

John Newmark

order to show that killing people is
wrong?“ i understood the
reierenee to be towards Central
America, and though i don‘t entire-
ly agree with the Socialistsolution,
. I do agree that the present policy is
wrong, so I purchased the button.
. During iall break, 1 skimmed
through a law magazine oi my
A father's tor the single purpose oi
‘ iinding a subject ior an editorial. 1
ran across an article entitled. “The
. Fate oi Teenage Killers,” Apr
parently the Supreme Court will
c soon have the opportunity to decide
whether the death penalty is con-
stitutional with respect to minors. I
.am against the death penalty ior

anyone so my viewpoint on this
question is obvious. My mind,
however, did recall the button i
purchased the preceding week that
asked why we “kill people who kill
people in order to show that killing
people is wrong.” The button was
beginning to take on a broader
meaning than i had originally ex-
pected

While the issue oi capital punish-
ment has been hashed and rehash»
ed hundreds oi times irom both
sides oi the issue, and _while most

lawyers are now in the process oi
taking the case to the Supreme
Court.

There are two main arguments
that l have heard in favor of the
death penalty: deterrence and
retribution. There are ample
studies that show there is no deter»
ring eiiect on adults, and it iollows
that minors are not deterred,
either. Common sense tells us that
a i5- or iseyear—old is not the type
oi person who will plan out, step by
step. a cold-blooded murder. A

okay

criminal irom committing a crime

again, and although the death
penalty is loo-percent successiul at
this, i think, most people agree
that ii rehabilitation is possible. it
is much more humane and just
than death. Common sense again
tells us it is the juvenile who is
most easily rehabilitated. A
15-year-old by no means has set his
morals and belieis in stone yet.
Statistics support this tact.
Juveniles have the lowest rate of
recidivism oi any group.

 

“Capital punishment with respect to minor: is a subjeL‘t that is not

because those who are

against it may assume

that someone would have to be insane to argue otherwise."

readers are thoroughly bored with
the topic by now, capital punish»
ment with respect to minors is a
subject that is not talked about
oiten. Perhaps this is because
those who are against it may
assume that someone would have
to be insane to argue otherwise.
The State of Oklahoma, however,
has a 16 yearold on death row.
This 16- -yearold was only 15 when
he committed his crime. His

murder committed by a juvenile
will be emotionally caused by un-
premeditated. lt is exactly this
type oi crime that is impossible to
deter since the criminal does not
think through the actions and cone
sequences beiorehand.
Retribution is a difficult reason
to argue against, The biblical “an
eye ior an eye” is deeply ingrained
in many hearts. However, the pur-
pos'e 'of retribuiiun is to deter the

In conclusion. let us remember
that two millennia ago a pagan
named Socrates was one oi the
ﬁrst to say that one should never
do harm to another for any reason,
He emphasized “never" and so
should we. Never harm a person,
even if he harms others, because
harming people is always wrong.
