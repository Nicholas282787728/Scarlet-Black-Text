ticket policy

 

Dear Mr. irving.

Last spring during our Grinnell»
in-London orientation meeting, as
well as in private conversations,
you intormed various members oi
our group that tickets to all
Grinnell-ianondon iield trips
would be available tree to all
Grinnell-in-London students
regardless oi whether we were
enrolled in the class

We were understandably upset
when we arrived in London and
were told that those or us not
enrolled in particular classes
would be charged regular admis-
sion lees We have been iniormed
that enough tickets ior all Grinnellr
ln-Londun students have already
been purchased so we are curious
to know why students who wish to
attend these events must pay lull

Current policy and
problems detailed

Kirsten Seaqutsl. '39. one of this

ticipants, recently sent a letter to
Donald lrviiig, director of Oti-
Campus Studies. In it. she asked
irving to reconsider his decision
regarding theatre tickets tor the
GrlrL participants. The current
policy is that tickets ior one perlol'r
iiianee a week are provided by the

that the tickets would be provided

It, as you claim, the policy con

last spring, we would have apr

policy was decided, As it is now,
our schedules and, more impo

We hope you will reconsider your
decision regarding tickets and

on proposed Changes

Open curriculum accomplishes goals

To the Editor:

As the dust settles irom Tues-
day's open iorum about the propos»
ed 3-2 teaching program and the
college curriculum, 1 turther ad
dress several comments made by
those present, especially Wally
Walker, acting president oi Grinr
nell College,

I mention the proverbial dust
because oi the nature oi the words
and ideas exchanged at this
iorum; the tone oi many oi the
students present was aggressive,
oiten seeming to attack rather
than question Walker and his re-
cent address to the iaculty concer-
ning “the state oi Grinnell's cur»
riculum " Perhaps this was unr
necessary, ii, as Walker stated on
Tuesday, he merely desired to en-
courage evaluation oi the cur
riculum, without mandating or [en
ding support to any changes at the
present. Perhaps his statements in
the address. including “How long
will we continue to try to convince
ourselves that the best course oi
action in regard to the College's
curriculum is maintaining the
status quo" " and “How long can
we continue to make jokes about
how this iaculty cannot devise and
approve any major change?" and
lastly his exhortation to "over
come the iactors that have made
curricular reiorm a seemingly im-
possible task in recent years" have
been grossly misunderstood
Perhaps.

i do, nonetheless, wish to
evaluate “the state oi Griiinell's
curriculum" in an objective man

Mr, Walker on Tuesday night,
beginning with the objectives oi

To the Editor

'l‘uesd , night. a hundred or so
students had an open toruni iiitli
Waldo Walker and coinpani- I
think the students were pretty pen
about voicing their opinions and
discussing their riews. Waldo
Walker. on the other hand. didn‘t
seem to be quite as upiroiit rind
honest with us

I thought Mark Schumann‘s
comments idle ill the discu ' n
were most illuminating Waldo
Walker had all evening been telling
us how no one had really taken a
good hard look at the curriculum
since 1970 when Griiinell iient to an
open curriculum. As it turns out,
houevcr, according to Mark. ll\'C
years ago twhcn today‘s seniors
were still prospective i there was
what he "tilled the "Pai'slmr Pro
po, til," uhich did indeed involve a
a good hard look" at the cur-
riculum. Apparently it as a malr
tor oi much debate back then in a
di own with a leilou student
alter the meeting 1 was also told
about Grlnncll's sell evaluation or

 

any curriculum and speciiically
that oi Grinnell, as a liberalarts
college. in the short run, the objec»
tives oi the curriculum may be to
provide a major iield, and to
prepare students ior‘ graduate
studies or background tor a career,
Transcending these, however, is
an objective oi even greater impor
tance, especially given the com-
mitment to a liberalrarts educa-
tion; it is the development at in
dividuals who possess a broad
understanding at numerous sub
jects, as well as communication.
discussion, and decisionrmaking
skills which enable them to tune-
tion eiiectively in society

I believe that the current open
curriculum policy more than ade
quately accomplishes these objec
tives. it iacilitates the acquisition
oi this “broad understanding" by
allowing ilexibility in student
scheduling; since aside irom
courses to complete one's major,
no academic timetable oi re
ouirements must be iuliilled. it enr
courages student and iaculty in-
terest alike in the courses taught,
since each oi them has ireely made
a commitment to study or teach
the subyeet, The individuality oi
each student can be expressed
without hindrance. Still, the most
compelling reason which I
perceive ior the continuation or
Grinnell's current curriculum
policy is that it allows students to
accept the responsibility ior their
dec' 'ons. it is this reason which
contributes most ioroeiully to the
liberalrarts education and its ob.
jectives.

other things,

when ii student said something
about Waldo Walkei‘ proposed

making any such proposal The

mciit saying something about

idea had somehow conic irom the
studcnts present. That coniused
me.

I have to wonder ii Waldo Walker
iias anare at some oi the things he
said i have to wonder it he was
deliberately trying to mislead us or
whether be u as contuscrl. Ur ii as it
me?

You know, come to think oi it.
some oi the qucsliolis about Waldo
Walker sound vaguely like another

avoid the sciences, Dr the
humanities, or the arts given only
the limits oi 92 credits in any one
division. But. I firmly believe that
this is the exception, not the rule.
though a study oi this is deiinitely
warranted This is quite irankly
the only obvious negative aspect oi
the Curriculum policy as it. stands
that i can determine.

I do not object to introduction of
more interdisciplinary courses ior
their own intrinsic beneﬁts, though
not necessarily seeing a need to
remedy the “suffering of general
education” and provide a “shared
academic experience” which Mr,
Walker ieels is presently lacking. I
object to the institution at any re-
quired courses, other than the
freshman tutorial, whether interr
disciplinary tas Walker seemingly
advocates), or otherwise, This
would deny students the educar
tional experience oi realizing ior
themselves the need ior academic
balance between divisions and
departments. This objection would
also preclude stricter division re
quirements, itnot already rejected
as redundant.

Isn't deciding WHY to take a
course as important as the inter
mation gained irom the lectures
and readings oi the class itself?
This question deserves to be
answered yes if we truly believe in
the objectives or the liberalarts
education. And iiour answer is yes
then we must continue to provide
students with choices and deci-
sions: let ll'lese elements dominate
our curriculum. not requirements , .
which breed blind acceptance and
compliance — Diane Guniz. ~itti
