Trustees vote to

increase

by Jill Petty

Grinnell students will pay eight percent
more next year for tuition, room and
board, student activities. and forum
fees

. The comprehensive tee will jump
from the 1886-87 charge of $11,930 to

$12,838. The college's Board of
Trustees voted for the increase, the 19th in

19 years, at the annual February meeting
last weekend.

President George Drake explained that
the fee hike will allow the college to con-
tinue financing a three year program to
raise faculty salaries. Drake said Grinnell
does not compare favorably to other small,
selective, private schools in terms of facul-
ty wages, Drake and Wally Walker, Ex~
ecutive Vice President of the College,
estimated that most incoming faculty
tflrst-time teachers with PhD's) presently
earn between $22,000 and $24,500 a year.
”This places us near the bottom.” said
Drake, ”and we’ve got to improve on our
ability to attract and hold on to our best
faculty. Some professors might want a lit
tle extra to teach here instead of Boston.”
This year iaculty salaries will increase by
nine percent.

Asked about the possiblility of using en,
dowment iunds to cover the salary in
creases, Walker said, “Grinnell is doing
mucll better than other schools in terms of
using its endowment. Only 15 percent of
the average college's operating expenses
are covered by endowment revenue,” he
said. “Oberlin invests 12.5 percent, Mid»
dlehury 9.3 percent, Kenyon even less.
Over 33 percent of our budget is covered by
the endowment.”

According to Walker, the market value
of Grinnell’s endowment is 174 million

t ' t '
dollars. it is one of the largest endowments
in the country, ranking with Harvard and
Yale in the top three in terms of dollars per
student.

Walker said that student financial aid
has been proportionately increased along

with the fee hike. For example, a student
who is getting a $3,500 Grinnell Grant will

’ find his or her grant increased by eight

percent next year. “And every student's
education at Gl'lnnell is still heavily subr
sidized,” emphasized Drake. Grinnell
depends less on studentgenerated income
(tuition, room, board, etc.) to cover
operating costs than other similarschools
do. Walker said that around 55 percent of
the college’s annual operating fees come
from tuition, He Cited other colleges
(Oberlin, Colorado, Kenyon) where up to
80% oi the operating expenses are paid by
the students,

The health fee was the only college ex»
pense not increased. Drake said the col»
lege “provides less in Younker than we did
before...we felt it would not be politic to
raise the health fee at this time.”

in addition to raising faculty salaries,
the administration plans to make im~
provements in the library's holdings. “A
library enrichment fund of $30,000 has
been established to make back purchases,
in addition to the normal library budget,“
said Drake

Walker said that faculty numbers will be
up next year, and that money had been
allocated for,new positions, ”We’ll have
more faculty next year than We’ve had In
some years,” he said, He added that en
dowed chairs (MeyerrEconomics, Noun-
Women's Studies) will have greater finan-
cial leverage next year:

 

Dorm thefts continue,
over $500 stolen

by Christina Ridenhour

According to Bob TownerrLarsen, Assis-
tant Dean of Student Affairs, nine thefts
occurred in college dorms between Tues»
day, February to and Monday, February
16. In all, approximately $500 in cash, a
knapsack, and two cassette tapes were
stolen. The only dieft that occurred on
North Campus was in Clark Hall. The
other thefts were in Cleveland, James, and
Loose Halls on South Campus.

Jim Tederman. dean of Student Affairs,
has been with the college for 18 years. He
said that periodically “an outbreak (of
thefts) like this” occurs. He said the last
time a similar situation occurred was
“four or iive years ago."

Although the knapsack was taken from a
hallway in Cleveland, all oi the cash was
taken from unlocked rooms. The intruders
took money irom dressers and desks, but
overlooked gold jewelry and credit cards.
The contents of the stolen knapsack were
left dumped in the hallway.

At least four of the students who were
robbed are certain that their rooms were
entered between 10 and 12 am.

Grinnell police officer Randy Hanssen
said that six thefts in dorms have been
reported to the police in the last two weeks,
An additional six thefts were reported in
the area around the college in the same
two-week period. Hanssen said that this
number of thefts is “higher than usual” for

residential areas, as well as for dorms.

Hanssen does not know whether the -

residential and dorm thefts are related or
if there is a connection between the thefts
in collegeowned houses over winter break
and the most recent burglaries. But he
said the earlier thefts differed from the
more recent ones in that previously, equip
ment such as computers and stereos was
stolen.

Police have “minimal descriptions of
people that might possibly have been in
volved” in the thefts, said Hanssen. Barb
Krantz, resident advisor for Loose and
Read Halls, said that “two unrecognized
college-aged men were seen in the halls
about the time of the thefts.” After the
burglaries were discovered, a description
of the men was given to the police.

Hanssen said he could not speculate at
this point as to whether it is college
students or townspeople who are responsi-
ble for the thefts.

Towner-Larsen said that the best
“preventative medicine" against theit is
to keep doors locked and to question un»
familiar people in a friendly way, with
“Can I help you find someone?" However,
if students see anyone entering a room in a
suspicious manner, they should “call the
police immediately,” said Towner-Larsen.
He urges students to avoid confrontations
which might be dangerous.

Internship

by Susan Simon with Jill Petty

Grinnell’s semester internship program,
administered by the Career Development
Office, is being formally evaluated by
faculty members for the first time in its
fifteen-year history. The recommenda-
tions of the Evaluation Committee’s report
are, thus iar, stirring up discussion on the
pros and cons of maintaining a “non
academic” four-credit endeavor in the
curriculum. ,

The Evaluation Committee recently
voted to limit the number of internships to
so per semester, and to allow students to
be graded on a pass/fail basis as well as by
letter grades. The recommendations
pleased some professors who were grow-
ing concerned about the direction of the
program.

Biology professor Bruce Voyles is a com-
mittee member, and he believes the
changes were good. He said he and some of
his fellow lacultymembers had felt some
confusion about the “purpose” of the4pr07

gram. And because internships involve
such a different kind of evaluation, ” said
Voyles some faculty members who spon-

role they are to play in the whole process. '*
He believes the report has clarified some
of these issues,

But some faculty still see unresolved
questions. Bob Voertman, economics pros
fessor, said that “the internship has
changed character” over the years, and
that members of his department are often
. asked to sponsor internships that he feels
“don’t meet the requirements." Voertman
asserted that not much serious ins
vestigatory work has been done in the in-
ternships he is familiar with, and that the
iinal projects required of every intern
have often been below par.

He said the faculty originally approved
“on-the-job investigation, not experiential
learning. The program is too loose," he
continued, “and I don't think anyone

 

knows what it is anymore.”

sor interns have not been Sure about ”the

program

goals evaluated

SGA president Ali ElSaffar said the tone
oi the report implies that internships are
somehow “inferior" to traditional learning
experiences, “The changes aren’t all that
drastic,” he Said. ”I object more to the at-
titude than the actual recommendations."

But ElSaffar does want to raise the
number of internships per semester to as,
if possible. He noted the larger size of next
year's senior class. “which could well
cause the number of internship applicants
to go up." He also maintained that intern-
ships can only enhance a student’s liberal—
arts education, because “one out of 32
coursa does not undermine anything...we
are trying to integrate students into socie-
ty here."

Jo Calhoun, internship coordinator and
assistant director of Career Development,
said the super-semester cap will “really
just spread the internships out a bit. This
year,” she continued, “there were 10 in-
ternships first semester and 46 second
semester “

"The academic component of (the internship) will be
as strong as the faculty sponsor makes 1t,” stud
said Marilyn Kurtz, director of Career Development.

The director of Career Development,
Marilyn Kurtz, does not want to limit the
number of internships available to
students. “I believe that every student
Should have the option to do an internship
while attending the college,” Kurtz said
the benefits of interning, which include
learning how to organize one’s time, gainr
ing work experience, and preparing for life
after Grinnell, are extremely valuable.
”When you pair a liberal-arts education
with hands-on experience, you’ve got the
best of both worlds,” she said. As to the
dispute about the rigorousness of an inn
ternship, Kurtz contended that “the
academic component of it will be as strong
as the faculty sponsor makes it."

Next week the requirements for the pro-
gram will be examined, and past and me
sent student-interns will comment on the

‘ quality of their work experiences.
