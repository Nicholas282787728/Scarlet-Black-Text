Afghanistan and
propaganda: what is

really happening?

To the Editor.

Afghanistan. it seems that each
of us have thoughts concerning the
Soviet occupation of this small
Asian country. We have been home
barded with propaganda concern
ing human rights abuses, chemical
warfare, and mass extermination
of innocent elders and children, yet
within each of our minds, we do not
know what to believe We ex
perience doubt. We are pulled by
our desire to see that justice and
humanity prevail, yet we are
reserved in our formation of opir
nions in an effort to avoid being
fooled by baseless rhetoric that
seeks to artificially stir our emo-
lion,

in a quest for a better understan-
ding of the Afghanistan situation, i
visited the Committee for Free
Afghanistan earlier this year while
in Washington, D C. l was allowed
access to many videotapes which
had been smuggled from
Afghanistan. Immediately. I was
struck as I viewed Valiant Afghan
freedom fighters battling with
what was portrayed as heartless,
aggressive Communists i watched
as Soviets attacked the Afghan
resistance with Chemical Warfare,
1 saw an interview with a young
woman who had suffered burns
over to percent of her body when
she tried, unsuccessfully, to rescue
her young son during a Soviet bom-
bing spree. She was refused
medical assistance from the
Afghan Communist hospitals.
Amazingly, she survived a long,
strenuous trek over the mountains
to receive care in Pakistan. My
emotions were stirred to an intense
peak, yet within the back of my
mind, I realized that all this was
propaganda

A photographer had just left the
room 1 was sitting in, and while
viewing the film, i approached the
table where he had placed a stack
of pictures several hundred in
number. The top picture was that
of a 2d year-old child, it had
evidently stumbled upon one of the
explosive toys which the Soviets
are accused of dropping across the
countryside. The bomb had blown
away a vast section of the middle
of the body, stripping away the
genital area and removing part of
the lower abdomen. This wound
had healed in such a way that the
Child’s skin had grossly fused
together at the top of the limbs.
Other pictures showed destruction
of children in a far greater propor
tion, They are pictures that Cannot
be forgotten, At that time I realin
ed that one individual's propaganr
da can be another's reality.

While these children may be us-
ed for propaganda, the fact re
mains that they are or were living
beings, Some will have to live with
severe deformities for the rest of
their existence, Many will not
receive the medical care needed to
perform the delicate surgeries to
restore normal. even comfortable
life,

in the upcoming days, you may
be given the opportunity to find out
what is happening in Afghanistan,
1 urge you to cut through the
rhetoric. to see beyond the politics,
and to seek an understanding of
what is truly occurring in this
small Asian country. Let us seek to
cast aside any externallyrformed
biases and let us cast away our in
ner ignorance in an effort to sort
through words and find the truth.

Waltz lovers condemn
music changes

To the Editor:

At approximately 11:40 PM, two
Saturdays ago “Brickhouse” by
the Commodores came roaring
over the pa. speakers in Darby
gymnasium. Normally during a
party this occurrence would at-
tract little notice, but this was no
normal party. This was the long
awaited winter waltz, and when
the heavy drums of the Com-
modores began we could hardly
believe our ears, We had spent the
entire evening struggling to
discern the beat of the poorly
selected music, and had Just begun
to get used to it and enjoy
ourselves when all of a sudden we
were assaulted with the typical
fare of this campus' mediocre par-
ties initially we had thought that
midnight had crept up more quick
ly than we’d expected, but upon
checking the time realized that the
stooges who had been entrusted
with the musical duties had
Jumped the gun and begun to play
whatever they wanted Not wan-
ting to get stuck in the middle of an
allrcampus freeinnall, we left to
pursue our evening activities. Later,
we were told, the waltz music reap-
peared, but by then many oi those
who had Come to waltz had left in
disgust.

We questioned the people in
charge of music briefly after the
change. wondering why the waltz
music had been stopped before
midnight and exactly who they
thought they were to commence
the freeriorrall without regard to
the time or the people’s Wishes, but
met with no sympathy, So ended
the winter waltz, and even if we’d
been around when the Waltzinusic
had started back up, it is doubtful
that we would have been In'
terested

Because many people place
great importance upon the “Last
Dance," it would have been nice if

we had at least been informed
when that dance was to be, This
has been a problem in previous
years as well, as we cannot
remember a winter waltz that end
ed when we thought it would or one
at which we were informed of the
final waltz. with neither an an
nouncement nor the clock to work
with, it is impossible to estimate
which waltz will be the last.

Now it's time to start bitching.

The music was poor at best. in
the fiist hour there were almost no
real waltzes, i.e. in threefoui-
time. They had plenty of other
types but few waltzes. The waltzes
they did play were in complicated
tempos which are hard for ex»
perienced waltzers to handle.
There is a great difference bet
ween symphony waltzcs and
ballroom waltzes. Yes, symphony
Waltzes are wonderful to listen to,
but they are hell to dance to.

Then there was the sound
system For the first half hour the
sound was so low no one could hear
the music. Then they turned the
volume up, unluckily it was so loud
it gave many people splitting
headaches and caused some to
leave, Then finally, around ten
o‘clock, the sound got better,
because the sound technician
decided to show up. From then on
the music was just poor. not too
loud.

Dwelling on the sound problems.
the speakers were so bad that any
rhythm the songs might have had
was completely turned into a dull
rumble, making it impossible to
keep step with the music.

Just so you don't get the picture
that we're griping at everything,
we do have two compliments: the
waltz started on time, and the
decorations were nice, although a
little law (no tree to get in the
waytlll

The problem here is that the
waltz iS, after all, the major social
event of the semester. People look
forward to it and often invite
friends to Grinnell to take part in
it. It is an event intended to provide
a more relaxed atmosphere than
the all-campus parties, where pear
ple can socialize and dance without
being saturated by the usual beer,
sweat, and deafening music of the
Gardner bashes However this
winter waltz, though an improve
ment over last year's Quad fiasco,
was not such an event. — Vlike

Cultural illiteracy strikes high school students .. .
and columnists

Over the past semester 1 have
written about a multitude of mpics.
I started in September with an arti-
cle comparing the francdntra Af-
fair to Dostoevsky's “Crime and
Punishment," while just two
weeks ago I managed to weave

John Newmark

human sacrifice, Anuiony Ken-
nedy, and the word ”deja vu" into
one column. Although the columns

. have covered a wide range of
issues, discussing everything from

, photography to capital punish-
ment, there has been a. consmnt
eme contained in all the col-

, g mns. Each column has described
, some political or social aspect of
our nation that frightens or worries

me,

perhaps the most frightening oi
these issues is the apparent lack of
cultural literacy inherent in
modern society, While cultural il»
literacy may seem at first _a
minor problem, its effects are ac-
tually quite dangerous, in my Col-
umn about ED. Hirsch's novel on
this same topic. i included the
famous quote, “If we forget the
past we are condemned to repeat

it.” If we forget the causes and
events of World War II, Vietnam,
or any other historical event, the
odds are that we will repeat our old
mistakes. Only if our children are
taugh .our past mistakes will they
have a~chance to escape from tall»
ing mm the same traps.

Our generation has not been
taught well. Anyone who reads the
newspapers and magazines or wat-
ches the news on T.V. has probably
seen the results of countless tests
given to high~school and college
seniors. Neutyrﬁve percent of all
highrschool seniors in Dallas could
not name the country bordering
the us. to the south. A large
number of students on the East
Coast could not shade in the New
England colonies on a map of the
United States. Students nationwide
cannot find Vietnam on a map.
Geography is only one area of
knowledge in which American
students are struggling; there are
many more facts I’ve heard that
are more frightening.

There are college graduates who
Can't identify the leaders of the
main powers during World War ll.
They have no idea who Churchill,
Roosevelt, Stalin, and Mussolini
are. Blitzkrieg and Mein Kampf
are yust two German words with
little meaning to most of these peo
ple who, along with us, will cons
stitute the next generation of
American leaders. If we haven't

been taught the lessons of World
War ii, how are we going to pre-
vent World War III? The answer to
this question, according to a trio of
singers who were popular in the
19605, “is blowing in the wind."
Also blowing in the wind of my
mind is the uncomfortable-feeling
that i, too, may be culturally ilr
literate. in the columns of the past

has been the consistent misspelling

out to me that he rarely spells his

that must be dealt with in the

tions. this nation's future leaders
will fail. There is a simple solution
to this problem, and i mentioned it
in my column about EiD. Hirsch.
The solution is not a list of trivia to
memorize word for word, but in-
stead to instill into the young the
