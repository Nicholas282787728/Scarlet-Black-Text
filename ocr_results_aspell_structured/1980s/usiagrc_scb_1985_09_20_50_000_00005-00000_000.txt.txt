Mill ”0°", Illlei'al arts callous: . . . and mm ma slmllarlllas and

Since going to Grinnell College, I have
thought about higher educatipn in Japan
and in the United States, I am afraid it is
dangerous to generalize about American
higher education irom my limited exr
perie‘iice at Grinnell College, but I believe
that by contrasting Grinnell College and
Waseda University in Tokyo I can make
c lear the difference between the American
and Japanese higher education because
both are liberal arts colleges and have
good reputations,

First. I will contrast the college admis:
sions policies in both countries. in Japan.
as expressed by the phrase “Examination
Hell," students have to study very hard to
get into their first choice colleges. The test
score is almost the sole criterion for deter-
mining who is accepted and who is not, so
there is great pressure on students to do
well on these tests. On the other hand,
while most colleges in die us, require apr
plicants to take either the Scholastic Apr
titude Test or the American College
Testing Program examination, high school
grades and other factors ranging from ex-
tracurricular achievements to athletic
a bility are usually more important criteria
for admission to college, .

Second. there is a difference in the time
a t which the major must be determined. In
Japan. students have to decide upon their
rn ajor in high school. because they haye to
take a certain specialized examination
w hich is determined by their major, Once
they enter a certain division of a certain
college, they can only change their divi»
sion with difficulty, 0n the other hand,
American students do not have to declare
their major until their junior year. so they
m ay generally take whatever courses they
like in their freshman and sophomore
years and on this basis determine the ma
jor that appeals to them most.

Third. I will discuss the transfer system.
American colleges and universities accept
credits from other schools. including Sum-
in er schools. and even lrom ioreign coun-
tries. Thls freedom to transfer credits
makes it easy our American students to
change schools. Changing schools is fre-
quently advantageous: it permits students
to iind a more suitable program. a more
convenient location. or lower tuition and
living expenses. Also. when they go abroad
to study. American students do not have to
ii orry about it costing them more, as they
w ill not have to make up for a lost year and
pay additional tuitlon.

In Japan. however, there is no way to
change colleges alter students
malriculate. nor can Japanese students
traiisiei- the credits they earned in foreign
countries, Allowing Japanese students to
traiisier credits would encourage even
m ore ol them to go abroad to study.

Fourth. there is a big difference in
academic pressure. It is quite easy to get a

degree from Japanese colleges. it is often
thc case that Japanese students have only
to memorize as many answers as they can
[or the tests they have twice a year, In iact
m ost students just collect notebooks irom

' nds, and copy them instead oi atten-
ding the classes. American Students can-
not do that. They are given many reading
assignments at every class and they must
complete them in order to keep up with the
proiessors. or course. because there are
more pressures at American colleges.
there are many more students who drop
out in the U,S, than in Japan.

Fifth. I will mention the relationship bet
ween students and iaculty. Because
Japanese colleges have a shortage or
facilities and faculty. most classes are
very'large, usually having several hunr
dred students. All professors do is convey
factual knowledgeto the students, and the
students rarely ask questions of pro-
fessors. In this way. education resembles
mass production. In the us, we can see
a smiliar problem in some large univer-
sities. but in small colleges like Grinnell
College. classes are basically very small.
The students very often ask questions and
discuss what they are learning in the
classes. Professors have “office hours"
during which theyxcan accept questions
from students and guide them individualv
ly. In Japan, students do not fill out evalua
tion sheets for each class as is done in the
U .S - _

Finally. I see the difference in students'
attitudes. Almost all Japanese students
see a college education simply as a path to
a prelerred job. They think that once they
get a job they cannot play anymore. so
they keep busy by travelling. going skiing,
or playing tennis while they can, In the
U .s,, however, students generally are very
positive toward studying, They come to
colleges ready to study hard. because they
know it is difficult to get a degree. In addir
tion to wanting to get a good job,
Americans have a clear goal of becoming
independent persons.

One oi the strongest impressions i have
had at Grinnell College is that each student
has his own opinion and expresses it clear-
ly, Arguing is a sort of sport and is very
often heard at the cafeteria, the pub. and
wherever else students get together. I
remember that l was surprised that many
students came to listen to the debates con
ducted by candidates for the presidency
of the Student Government Association. I
sense the tremendous energy which each

Generally speaking. the system oi
American higher education is much more
advanced in respect to structure, stan—
dards. and student attitudes. Now we must
consider what causes such a big difference
in thc higher education systems of Japan
and the U S.

First of all. we must remember that the
Japanese economy grew up too rapidly
after the World War II, Because of their in-
creascd wealth, many more iamilies were
able to send their children to college in
order to get a good Job. Consequently, coir
logos and universities were iorced to raise
the quota of entrants. this causing the lack
ol lacilities and iaculty

As a matter oi tact. private colleges ex-
panded luster and to a greater extent than
national colleges These privatc colleges
assumed heavy debts for construction of
new buildings, Compared with private col~
lcgcs in other countries. Japanese private
colleges rely more heavily on students' tui»
lions. and student resistance has
prevented the raising ol tuitions. The
result has been less money for the colleges
and the lower standards of college educa-
tion.

American private colleges are usually
supported by private philanthropy and
alumni donations and tullions are relative

ly high. iherciorc. thcii' iiiiancial situation

is much better and accordingly the
lacilitios and iacully are also better. in the
u s. overcrowding is soon more at the
state universities, but even at these institu»
thllS the situation is not as bad as it is in
Japan

Second, we have to consider the dii-
lcrcncc in the employment system, Many
Japanese companies have a liietime

employment system. These 'companies
can educate workers through the long
term. and in fact invest a large amount of
money in workers‘ education. They don't

which ranges from special technical train-
ing to fostering loyalty to the company,
But American companies operate on the
m erit system. They want to hire students
who are already able, They hire men and

title iosnlillsa

women or ability and do not invest in
workers' education. American companies
think that education should be done at the
college level.

Moreover, Japanese colleges are ranked
from excellent to poor. Japanese society
has what is called “gakureki shakai,"
m caning that students are hired not on the
basis of their college grades but largely on
the basis (if the reputation of the college
they go to Thus. once they have been ad-
m itted. there is little incentive for them to
study with any diligence,

On the other hand. as I mentioned
belorc. America has an employment
system based on merit. American
students' college grades do matter, so
students have to study hard. So American
students have to train themselves hard in
order to seek a better life.

Third, to the Japanese. education has
been seen as an investment in the
country's economic future. since Japan’s
opening to the West, learning tor its own
sake. or as a means to realizing fuller
livcs. has been a secondary concern
Japan felt thrcatened by the West, and
devoted all oi her energies to the purpose
oi catching up with it.

On the other hand, American education

emphasizes learning how to think, exploi'e,‘

research. and develop cach student’s abili-
ty and creativity Americans consider it
in ore important to learn how to set up a
problem and to learn how to solve it than
simply to accumulate knowledge, For ex
ample. in many American high schools
and colleges there are classes such as
logic. debate. and speech, which are not
available in Japan. This diiierence in at
titudes toward education causes the difr
ierciice in college students attitudes
toward study

For all ol these reasons. Japanese
higher education has become what it is
now, But thc situation oi the country has
been changing We cannot allow the cur
rent college cducalion system in Japan to
commute any longer. A relorm oi the entire
Japanese educational system is iiccossary
tor the lollowing three reasons

First is the fact that the “Examination
Hcll" causes serious harmiul eiiccts. The
prcssurcs oi examination harm the rela-
lionships between students. Many students

tend to see their colleagues as nothing but
rivals in the examination competition,
Also, school violence has abruptly increas~
ed. especially by students who cannot
keep up with a tight curriculum. Finally,
the students' creativity and individuality
a re forgotten.

The Current entrance examination
system requires extensive factual
knowledge so all students do is memorize.
Moreover. once a student passes an en-
trance examination, he does not have to
study hard. and therefore whatever advan-
tages Japanese high school graduates
have over their American counterparts
are effectively eliminated for those
Japanese students who go on to higher
education, When you consider that
Japanese parents are spending a great
d eal oi money to have their children go to a
private small school or have a tutor, you
can see how wasteiul Japan has been oi
society's time. and money. .

Secondly. the period or rapid economic -
growth has ended in Japan. and the
Japanese economy is now in an advanced
stage of industrialization Technological
inliovation happens more rapidly, and
society is changing more dramaticall) and
becoming more complicated. Offices are
being computerized and mechanical tasks
such as iniormation management are be
ing taken over by computers, In this situa
tion the type at person which society
demands is changing A person who is
merely a gear in an enterprise, who is
cooperative and has no character Will not
he demanded any more. Increasingly, as
A mericans can see in the classified ads. 3
person is being demanded who is marked
by a strong personality, is creative and
positive. and is iull oi pioneer spirit, But it
is diiiicult to produce this type or person
under the current educational system in
J apan.

Thirdly. countries are getting more and
more dependent on each other, lnlernur
tionalism is advancing. A person who is
more ol a trained cosmopolitan will be
needed [or Japan to remain an advanced
country. It is true that more students have
gone abroad recently, but is it possible to
cultivate the international sense simply by
going sightseeing and buying gifts?

Since Japan is a nation composed oi a
s iiiglc ethnic group and there are very ievv
opportunities to meet lorcigncrs. It is
necessary to encourage students to
cullivale an international sense by dlvlsV
ing a system that allows lransicr crcdits
in keeping with this change, students
should be taught English more effectively
so that they ca'n study abroad, In fact. the
exclusivcness of the Japanese higher
education system has often been criticized
by ioreign countries The present system
or higher education in Japan. geared as it
is in J nese industry. is no longer fitted
for lhi internationalized era.
