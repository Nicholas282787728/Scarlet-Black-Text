College Reviews Ban on Financial Aid
to Foreign Students Studying Abroad

The administration is considering
changing a new college regulation
that prohibits interttational students
from applying their ﬁnancial aid to
tire cost of off-campus programs.

The Student Government Asso-
ciation condemned the new rule in a
resolution Oct. 4. In the resolution,
Joint Board said it condemned the
new regulation as “discriminatory
toward international students." SGA

urged the administration to “review ;

and eliminate said policy change im-
mediately."

The new policy, college ofﬁcials
said, stems from the belief that US.-
born studentsshould have ﬁrst crack
at study-abroad programs, The for—
eign students, they said, are having
their international experience right
here in Grinnell,

According to Jan Czechowski,
director of off-campus study, a re
cent meeting with ofﬁcials of sev-
eralMidwestcolleges revealed simi-
lar ﬁnancial aid policies concerning
international students who wish to
study abroad. Czechowski cited
Macalester College, which holds a
belief shared by many colleges: that
the international students are study-
ing abroad by coming to the United
States.

”The fact mat they’re coming here,

Government Association the question of the college‘s policy that
forbids international students from applying their ﬁnancial aid to

the cost of off-campus programs.

“The motel learn about the issues
surrounding abortion,” said Katie
Goddard, “the more frustrated I get
that those who are in power don‘t
seem to grasp the whole effect that
moreregulation of abortion will have.

“The dance was just one way of
ventingmyarrgcrinapositiveform,"
saidGoddard,oneofthemembersof
the Politically ActiveFeminist Alli»
ance who organized last Saturday’s
16-hour danceathon.

The danceathon, held to raise
money to send the group to an up-
coming abortion-rights march in
Washington, DC, began at 6 pm
Saturday in North Lounge and lasted
until 9 am. Sunday. The 16 hours
symbolized the 16 years between
1973, the year of me Roe v. Wade
decision. and 1989, the year of the
Webster case. Goddard said the
danceathon was “symbolic of repro-
ductiveandaboniontightsfreedom."

DJ ‘5 playedeverything from disco
to Lawrence Welkand the folk danc—

ers came to teach participants Polish
and Israeli dances. The walls of the
Forum were covered witharticles on
abortion and copies of recent legis-
lation. The banner that will be car-
ried by the group at the upcoming
march was also available for sign-
ing.

Goddard estimated that T—shirt
sales and the sponsoring of dancers
raised $200 to $250. But according
to P.A.FiA founder Rashmi Dyal-
Chand, the danceathon was “signiﬁ-
cant more as a campaign towards a
long-term goal—one of manyevents
we’ve been doing to prepare for the
march"

About 100 people participated in
the danceathon but no one lasted the
full 16 hours. Winning the awards
for endurance were Katie Goddard,
Tara Neavins, Em ma Hershey.Judy
Cohen and Zabrae Valentine.

Goddard stressed thatmany people
were involved in organizing the
event, including Melissa Koch, Julie
Garrison, Zabrae ValentineandTara
Neavins.

may be considered an international
experience in itself," he said

Czechowski said that a student’s
nationality or ﬁnancial aid status do
not factor into his or her acceptance
to an offvcampus program.

College president George Drake
said that the current policy is being
reviewed and a decision should be
reached within about two weeks.

“We are considering possible al-
terations on the policy," Drake said.
