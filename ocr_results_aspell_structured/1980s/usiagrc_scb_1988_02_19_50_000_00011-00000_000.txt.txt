boosted the point total. There were
no nose-bleeds, but the one-meter
board got in the way of Yvette

her in the emergency room with
six stitches Another eventwarrair

treestyle in which an entire heat.
including a nameless Grinnell
swimmer. swam a zsaeyard race.
Perhaps they should consider
counters for the zoo-yard events.

lacking. and so the team expects to

The room was a Chaotic jumble.
People milled about in Confusion
wiﬂ'i pained looks on their laces. A
mixture of screams and gunshots
added to the disorder. The very air
was hot and heavy. enshrouding
every person in the room and ad-
ding to the anguish. Forced to sit
and Wall. on a perilous incline, the
participants maneuvered about
with extreme caution. so as to
avoid tumbling into the abyss. Far
below. a tiny body of water was till
ed beyond capacity with com-
petitors The figures appeared to
be engaged in a liferandrdeath
struggle, Crowds cheered with
satisfaction as the torturous Com-
petition continued.

For most, such a scene would ap~
pear only in a nightmare. or

"Georg z"

The s cam pours forth from
both our mouths simultaneously,
as “G MCJ" steals. glides to the
hoop, and slams for another two.
Some books or red paint 7 cheap
watercolor paint. extremely bad
for the skin — flake off of our faces
yes. we’re the guys you see at all
the men's and women's basketball
games, the ones with their faces
painted red and black. of course.
since we’re in Grinnell. nobody ace
cepts that we do it for so simple a
reason as the. dreaded school
spirit. People ask all the time,
“Why do you guys do thati"

(Let's go Grinnell!"t

Well. this may Come as a shock.
but the reason is actually just that
simple. We've got school spirit.
Along with the Rat Pack and a
handful of faithlul fans. we are
forced to make up for the cheers
and noise that should be provided
by a packed house. When we turn
the question on the faithless, say»
ing. "The question. is why don't
YOU do it 7." they invariably
come up with the same run-down
reason: “Why bother? They won't
win."

l"Deeee~fensel Deeee-fense! ”D

That seems to be the prevalent
attitude around campus.“No, we
can't win. This is GRINNELL," So
what? We're (prepare for another
shock) GOOD. If anybody hasn’t

noticed. the women's team has
taken three of their last five at
home. and the men's team has
played excellent ball. Most or their
recent games have been lost in the
last minute or two; that is the sign
or a team with a a negative mental
attitude. Ever wonder how teams
developed a negative mental at»
titude'.’ Mostly. it's from being told
they're a bad team. that they‘ll
lose. There’s nothing like some
serious tan support to boost the
team over the top. The last two
men's games or the season are7:30
p.m. Friday night against Knox
eolllege and 1:30 pm. Saturday
against Illinois College, both at
Darby. The women play one away
before coming home for their final
game. 7 pm. Tuesday against
Clark Be there. Maybe just that
one extra voice 7 maybe YOURS
7 will be the one to boost them
over.
