In defense of The Game

Hello and welcome back to Grinnell
i hope everyone had an enyoyable
break Unfortunately my Christmas
vacation was marred by events which
conspired to drag the political, social,

,and cultural integrity oi the United
States through the mud oi disrespect
and shame. AS all of you probably
know, iorcign events over the past iew
months have shown the United States
to be a weak and helpless giant in
many areas oi the world The seizure
of our embassy in Iran and the invaa
Slim 0! Afghanistan were huge blows
to our national pride. More important»
ly, however; just last week Grinnell
College parthlpated in an atrocity
that cuts right to the heart of the na-
tional consciousness. Last Sunday, and
ior a number or years previous to this,
Grinnell College has brutally and
senselessly allowed the sanctity of the
Super Bowl to be marred by schedule
ing second semester registration in
conflict with The Game,

Throughout the Free World people
gathered to participate in a ritual that
traces its history all the way back to
the 60's. Leaders paused in their are
duous labors. children were unable to
sleep in anticipation, men and women
gathered in peace and harmony to
observe the culmination of a long six
month pilgrimage by the NFL to the
shrine that is the Rose Bowl, Even
Iranian hostages, held for weeks with
little or no contact with the outside
world, were allowed to listen to a
broadcast of The Game by the normals
ly insanely zealous militants holding
the Embassy. Everyone watched!
Everyone, that is, except Grinnell Cola
lege students.

Millions of dollars Changed hands in
wagers, not to mention the huge
advertis ng bills corporations paid for
commercial time. Tickets were bought
ior outrageous sums by those who
wished to see and be seen at The
Game. Cheerleaders were as little as

POSSlblC, ilailed their arms convulsive:

ly and sm named nonsensical phrases
to the delight oi millions oi watching
tans. It was an inherently American
contest in theme and scope, and to
debase it by requiring registration on
the same day is uninrgivable.
especially at a time when Americans
ought to be united behind their institu-
tions

But the signiiicance oi the timing oi
this travesty was not lost to those who
engineered it. The college would have
you believe that it was re»
quirements oi the academic calendar
that necessitated our return on the
20th. Or perhaps they would claim
that the 1:00 start of registration did
not Conﬂict with the 5:00 kICk-oﬂ'
Would those explanations be accepted
it registration were held on Christmas
or the 4th of July? Hardly

l suppose‘that it is also a
“coincidence" that at a time when the

'io'noo'ry '25’,‘ WBO

eyes oi the world were iocused on the
political preiereiices of the state, one
oi its iinest academic iacilities was
thumbing its nose at The Game.
Moreover, it was but a symptom oi
Grinnelrs continuing and pervasive
attack on sports in general, and
organized sports in particular.

Some may point out that I am ignol‘~
ing the crimes oi the Super Bowl supa
posedly perpetrated against a helpless
and gullible public Opponents accuse
the super Bowl oi the commercializar
tion and entrenchment oi questionable
tastes and values in the minds oi Mid-

-dle America They also contend that

The Game, with the help oi the
American government, has subjected
the sensibilities oi the American
public to brutal and inhuman tortures.
But the blackmail oi this institution
on the part ol militant ”academics" in
the pursuit oi some ephemeral doc-
trine is in no way justiiied by the
charges I've outlined above. There has
been some talk oi establishing a bin
partisan committee to reyiew the
aliedged crimes oi The Game This is
a policy I totally i-eiect. The issue here
is 80 American men who have devoted
their careers to the ideal oi champion
ship iootball. Any attempt on the part
oi this collcge to divert attention away
irom this issue, including sloganeering
iWinning isn't anythingrDeath to root

ball) is but a cheap propaganda ploy.

oi roe, We must show the terrorists
that we are prepared to tighten our - .

Secondly, I am calling ior tho mov-
ing oi the Grinnell Relays to a neutral
site, A sporting event with as much '
signiticance as the Relays cannot be ._
held in an environment so obviously
hostile to sports Spring is the time oi
high prospective visitation and the ad»
missions department will attempt to
slioiv the lighter side oi the college by
displaying the Relays. Can we allow '
the Relays to be used in such a cynical"
iashion'i I say no, '

Some may argue that the Relay
ideals oi hedonism, debauchery and
scattered necrophilia are too precious' ‘ ,
to be allowed to become embroiled in '
day»to»day politics But we are only ‘
iooling ourselves ii we think that the. ,
right to throw-up on Mac Field once a , -
year constitutes true sporting - ‘
ii-eedorh. We must sacriiice the single ’

 

Some may point out that I am ignoring the
crimes of the Super Bowl perpetrated
against a helpless and gullible public.

 

1 would even suggest that the real
reason behind this school's captivity oi
The Game lies iai- away ii-oni ihc
ideals oi Liberal Arts and Enlightened
Learning normally pi-opoiinded around
campus I would suggest that the
whole incident was designed to get the
students' minds off of the huge social
and economic problems stemming
from George Drake's coming to power
last semester Since that time it has
become apparent that there is really
no one in control of this college. Rival
factions of Deans, Profs. and
Secretaries have clashed repeatedly in
bids for power from which no one has
emerged as a clear leader The
plethora oi newspapers circulating
around campus last semester was in-
dicative oi the conilicting and ante ,
biguous inlormation that was coming
from the administration

What can be done to counter this
outrage? 0ui- response must be
measured. We must have restraint,
but still we must do something. As of
this moment I am calling tor a com-

oront to obtain the higher ideal. Only
then can we consider ourselves truly
lroo. «It's kind of like the ending to the
Slitl‘ 'l‘l'L'k Inovic )

Finallyl am asking all students to
flood the trout offices of the Los
Angelcs Rams and The Pittsburgh
Steelers with cards and letters. By
overwhelming them with mail we can
show the college that we are united in
our cause For those who wish to par
ticipatc,those addresses are: The LA.
Rams, LA Coliseum, LA , Cal. USA;
The Pittsburgh Steelers, Three Rivers
stadium, Pittsburgh, Pa, USA.

Yes, the Super Bowl is long over.

But if we allow our sellse of outrage Lu _ _

diminish, ii we allow this issue to 51'
to the back pages, we will lose iorcre'i
any hope oi respect in the intel‘ilaa
tional sporting world. Over the last

iew years The Game has lost some oi‘. . ’

its presitige It's become popular to‘ g:
ridicule it. But ii we are united, the
Super Bowl can once again be the
premiere sporting event in the world.
Let's not have to move it to Panama.
