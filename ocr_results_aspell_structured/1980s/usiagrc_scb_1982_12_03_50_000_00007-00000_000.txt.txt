Couches present a History of Sports
Past triumphs and the philosophy of sports discussed

by Eric Weiss

A surprising amount of past athletic
achievements and a short debate on the
philosophy oi winning that Grinnell should
have was a part of the presentation given
by John Harvey and Robert Bengal as a
part or History of Grinnell Week.

Boﬂ'l have collaborated to write a history
of sports at the college, a 16-page pamphlet
that briefly outlines the significant sports
developments of the past 135 years, As
noted in the preface, “Our objectives are
to provide a general account of Grinnell’s
athletic history, one diet can he digested in
a single dose. . . ."

Because of the general poverty of the
student body and the Civil War in which all
able bodied male students and faculty
members served, sports involvement durr
ing Grinnell's first 40 years was subdued.
Following the Civil War, in 1867, baseball
was introduced but participation remained
low. As one student in 1858 recalled:

This was the glacial period o/ amusements.
No gymnasium, na oaseball, no rowing, no glee
clubs, ml not/wig. We did hunt a little along the
ruler and in the woods. Life was much too
serious to be devoted to fnoolaos sports. at,
amusements were ”prisoners base" and ”mum
bam— mere genemlgames. We were nearly all
poor yoang men and had to cut wood and do
chores for our food and to pay board.

The newly formed baseball became suc-
cessful, however, several years later, cap
turing the state championships in 1394,
1896, 1899 and 1903.

The football team, established in 1399,
also became a powerhouse in its own right,
In its opening game, Grinnell soundly
defeated the University of Iowa, 244;, mak
ing it the first intercollegiate football
game played west at the‘ Mississippi. The
Grinnell football team went on to capture
the Iowan Championship in 1395, a year in
which they also defeated Minnesota and
Nebraska.

Track and Field, in‘ the true Grinnell
tradition, soon started winning championr
ships after the formation of the team. In its
first years, Grinnell's track and field

squad dominated state meets. In 1909, the
team won both H18 Iowa Intercollegiate
Track Meet and the Missouri Valley Con-
ierence championship,

The Success of Grinnell athletics promp-
ted the college to enter the Missouri Valley
Conference in 1918. Thus Grinnell, 3 coir
lege of 800 students at the time, started
competing regularly with colleges such as
Kansas, Iowa State and Washington
University As a result team victories
were fewer, For example, the football
team accumulated a 16-445 record in 20
years at Valley competition.

Because of ﬁle small size of the college
and the fact that recruitments and sub
sidizations of athletes were “almost
universal practices,” Grinnell wimdrew
from the Missouri Valley Conference in
1939 and entered the Midwest Athletic Con
ference, to which Grinnell still belongs. A
reporter from the Omaha World-Herald in
1939 commented on me ending or an era:

Hail Grinnell.l Here is a school that
throughout the years has deviated but little, if
any, from proper college athletic standards.
Yet, for its enrollment, it has had [me teams,
which, when matched against eqoaLs, always
waged keen contests and often won.

Harvey summarized the presentation by
noting that individual sports, such as track
and swimming, have generally been more
successful than team sports, such as foot
hall and baseball. ,

Bengal also offered a few words about
the philosophy on winning mat some Grinr
nellians have: “It’s tremendously
frustrating as a coach when you are trying
to put a team together and you assume
that everybody on his team has the same
attitude about winning; then one of your
best players comes up to you and says that
winning isn’t important, It just blows your
game. I think winning is important, frankr
ly . . .

Tim Stenzel offered an opposing view
point. He told of his cross country team
whose motto was “Run for Fun.“ “I'm ap~
palled at me idea that we should recruit

players for our athletic teams. Winning
isn’t important. What’s Important is the
development of your physical and mental

capabilities. The competiveness of a game
situation only adds to the fun, which is the
most important thing."
