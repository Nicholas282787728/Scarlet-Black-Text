It's time for the
boys of summer

by Bob Lifton

The sheets of ice which once
covered our campus have begun
to melt, This is an important
sign; it means spring is right
around the bend. So, you ask,
what’s so significant about
spring? After all, it’s just an-
other season, right? Contraire.
men frere: ‘tis the baseball sea
son!

Over the past month, Coach
John Martinek has been busy ex-
amining this year’s crop, at-
tempting to sift out the best tal-
ent and mold it into a contending
ball club. 1f years of experience
are any indication, this season’s
version of the Pioneer’s baseball
team will be something to see.

Martinek has already dubbed
this the “no-excuses season."
What, with so many veterans. the
coach maintains that there is no
room for mental error. “If we
have to, we can field a team of
only juniors and seniors,” he
claims. Let’s hope that baseball
fortitude is indeed like wine, get-
ting better with age.

Grinnell will suit up 12 re-
turning letterrnen from last year‘s
squad which finished with a 7-8
conference mark, tying them for
third place. A fresh blend of
newcomers will provide further

spark for the Pioneers.

As it appears now, three
pitchers will comprise the start-
ing rotation: seniors Brad Sherir
dan and Dave Steinman and
freshman Chris Wolfgrttm. See
niors Jim Wciand and (co-captain)
Wallace Squibb will come on in
relief.

Juniors Mike Mohan and
Corey Jones, along with senior
PJ. Epplcr, seem to have the
outfield slots firmly tucked under
their belts. This veteran Lriad
will be boosted by rookies Mike
Washburn and Kory Schroeder
and sophomore Andy RuLledge.

The infield is stocked with
upperclassmen. Squibb will hold
down first base, while senior Eric
Dahlin and junior Marty Hun—
sucker platoon at second. Junior
Mick Kulakowski is slated for
duty at short, with Jones,
Weiand, and sophomore Keith
Kroma'sh battling it out for the
hot corner. Senior (co-captain)
Randy Secley will quarterback the

team from behind the plate.
backed up by Kromash.

The Pioneers will once again
have their spring training down
in sunny Texas, squaring off
against perennial powerhouse
Ranger Junior College for seven
fun-filled ball games. As Ranger
will have already had the privi»
lege of playing 35 to 40 games,
the visitors from up north will
have all they can handlcrand
then some.

The regular season opens
Tuesday, April 4, when Grinnell
travels to Simpson. The Pio-
neers will host Cornell the folr
lowing week on the 11th in their
first home game.

In a pro-season assessment of
the upcoming scason, Martinck
said, “We will be it more com-
petitilive and lillrnround better
ball club this season.

Our numbcrrone goal is to
make the conference champi-
onships. I think we really have a
shot because this year they have
expanded the playoffs to two
tcnms per division."

Only time will lcll.
