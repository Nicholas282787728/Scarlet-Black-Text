‘Chinese commercials
help participation

3by May lee Chai

l Last semester while teaching
‘English at a night school for
iadults in China, my friend and I
toften would rack our brains Lry-
ing to think of ways to get the
students to participate more in
class. As there were 40 students
with varying degrees of language
icompetency, the situation hardly
lent itself to classroom discus-
sions.

In China most classes are
‘taught in a lecture format where
‘the teacher stands in front of the
:room and reads his or her notes
Eand tlte students diligently write
lit all down. So ingrained is this
{process that we found if we
lshould stray from the podium in
ithc front of the room, perhaps
walk down an aisle to be able to
lhear someone in the back better,
the rest of the class took this as a
,signal to begin talking.

As a result of the cultural
differences ill classroom etiquette.
,many of our attempts to increase
-.participation rotted. We tried in;
troducing a controversial topic
and then randomly calling on
people to express their opinion,

The first unlucky victitn
would gulp nervously and
desperately inumble a few non-
committal phrases. Thereafter
each person would basically rc-
peat this, occasionally changing a
few words but more usually just
adding a few filler words like “I
really think. . .” or “I truly think,

7’ or “I think, you know. . ."

We also tried having everyone
talk a little about his or her
interests, job, hobbies, and so
on. Again the first few studans
were forced to think on their feet,
but the process was so slow that
the others could simply whip out
their dictionaries, write out what
they wanted to say, then recite
their carefully prepared statements
when it was at long last their
turn.

Finally, my friend suggested
making everyone perform skits.
I thought this was a good idea,
especially since a chapter on
television was coming up in the
textbook. Without giving away
our intentions, we told everyone
to watch some television before
the next class and to pay special
attention to the commercial ad-
vertisemcnts.

The next class, everyone as
surcd me that they had had access
to a television, but just to be
sure, we demonstrated what a
commercial was like. We went
through the motions of com-
plaining about a headache and,
holding up a bottle of Tylenol,
explained how this product had
done just the trick to get rid of it.

Then we sprang our plan on
them. We divided thetn into
groups and gave each group
something to sell. I’d brought a
bag full of producLs: Crest tooth-
paste, a toothbrush, soap, tea,
cough drops, and a container of
Tang,

We explained they would all
have to make up a commercml
and pcrlorm it in front of the
class. “Everyone must have a
part,” l said, trying to anticipate
problems. “Everyone must
spca ."

' We and figured it would take

 

IO minutcsilj maximum—for
them to come up with something
to say. Twenty-five minutes
later, they were still in deep dis-
cussions.

I Sidlcd over to the loudest
group. They were supposed to be
working on a commercial to sell
tea. An older man, wearing the
kind of navy-blue suit that had
been ubiquitous during the Cul—
lural Revolution, was the center
of the controversy. His younger
classmates, all dressed in colorful
Western-style clothes, were
shaking their heads in exasperar
tion.

“He doesn't understand," one
said to me, sighing.

The older man was arguing
loudly, “But one person should
tell the truth! Someone should
say, ‘But I don't like this prodr
uctl'"

By now we had to start the
skits or there would not be
enough time for everyone to per-
form.

The first group was a lively
bunch of young men who ex~
pounded upon the virtues of .‘
toothpaste.

“Oh, oh, my gums are blced- ,
ingl" one cried.

“Herc is some Crest tooth-
paste for you. It will make them ,
better.”

Another group raved about
the “delicious taste" of Tangi
Finally it was time for the group.
that had been arguing before.

The scene took place in a lit- .
tlc snack shop Two customers
came in, a young man and the.
older man. ‘

“I have thirst “ the young
man announced i

“No problem " said the young
woman acting as proprietor of
the shop “We can give you col— ,
fee, tea, or ice cream' l

“Oh, tea, tea," both men said. i
The older man scowled slightly.

”Oh, this is very deliciousi
tea. Its taste is very good,” said ,
the young man -

“Yes. it is the best tea It Isl
Dragon brand tea " The young.
woman held up the tea bag for all'
to see. “Everyone should go out
and buy this tea." 1

Then the older man stepp cd 1
forward “I like coffee!" he an-
nounecd Beaming, hc‘then re-
turned to his seat.

This time his young partners
were scowling.

“Oh, that was very good!" I
said quickly and led the applause
His partners looked at me skepti-
cally. “Yes, it was very effec-
live It grabs your attention. It's
a good commercial."

Before this point could be de
hated, the bell rang and class
ended.

The class seemed to have on-
joycd themselves that night and it
broke the ice for later classes.
However, as we were gathering
up our things to leave, my friend
and I noticed a slnall red flag of
tile People's Republic was
hanging right them above the
blackboard. We felt a little odd
seeing it hanging there. After
all. we rcall'lctl with a start,
hadn‘t we j st got through
corrupting our class with blatant
capitalist propaganda?

 

 

 

ARLF AND BLACK

Up to half of the test samples failed

Condoms cause controversy

by David Rcssncr

Installation of condom ina-
ehines on campus was a contro-
versial issue among the adminis-
tration and staff involved in the
decision After much discussion.
the condom dispensers were put
iii the laundry rooms, but the
controversy rc-erupted when the
quality of the condoms came into
question in a recent issue of
Consumer Reports.

Prevention of the spread of
the AIDS virus is regarded as one
of the top resons for the installa-
tion of the machines, The
devastating and deadly effects of
AIDS have been widely publi-
cized and are well»known. So
tnuch so that condom sales have
increased by over 60 percent in
less than three years and whereas
women previously bought only
10 percent, they now account for
almost half of all condom pur-
chases. Condoms have been an
effective form of contraception
since the ‘305, but only recently
have they been found to do an
equally good job of preventing
the transmission of AIDS as well
as many venereal diseases.

In its own response to the
frightening AIDS epidemic,
Grinnell College began searching
last summer for a suitable brand
of condom and dispenser to be
placed in campus laundry rooms.
Under the direction of former dean
of student affairs James Teder-
man, the task was passed on to
Buildings and Grounds and the
Health Center. However, Tedcr—
man has since left Grinncll and
the Buildings and Grounds person
responsible has retired, leaving
Donna Bailey, director of the
Health Center, in charge.

With some help from Leslie
Ollinger. assistant director of
Buildings and Grounds Plant 0p-
crations, Bailey contacted a
salesman of the LifeStylcs brand
condom. Upon reaching an
agreement with the manufacturer,
the college bought dispensers for
each laundry room and in excess
of $250 worth of LifeStyles Nuda
Plus brand condoms. The four
dispensers were installed at the
end of Febntary and subsequently
stocked the first week of March.

End of story? Not quite.

Coincidentally, the Consumer
Report: March cover story de
tailed Consumer Union’s findings
on a study of 16,000 condoms
from 40 brands. Two sets of

unis ESTAUHAN‘I'

tests were conducted to establish
the relative strength of each con-
dom. The first, a water test, was
used to determine if any leakage
was present. In the process of
this test, Nuda Plus, thc brand
purcllascd by Grinnell, and one
other LifeStyles brand developed
bulgcsicvidenee of thin, weak
spots.

‘Consumcr Reports. March 1939

The second test consisted of
inflating the condoms and mea—

‘suring stress resistance. This is

the test upon which Consumer
Report: based its ratings, Fur-
ther substantiating the water-
lcakage test. the “airburst” test
showed that the two bulging
LifeStyles brands, Extra Strength
with spermicide and our very own
Nuda Plus, were exceedingly
wwk and inlolcrant of minimum

industry guidelines for air pres-
sure. Conrumzr Reports rated
both types last out of 40 brands
and found them to have a
“maximum failure rate of more
than 10 percent,“ while ”in some
lots, up to half the test samples
failed."

Within two days of this fact
being brought to the attention of
Bailey at the Health Center, the
condoms were removed from the
machines, Her dilemma lies in
the fact that she has two rather
difficult criteria to meet: the con-
doms have to contain
Nonoxynol-9, a spermicide, and
they must also be packaged in
such a way as to work in the dis—
pensers, which turns out to be a
very unique bomhapc as opposed
to the standard envelope.

Bailey got back in touch with
the salesman in Des Moincs and
expressed her misgivings over the
product and proceeded to order a
different Lichtyles brand, Extra
Strength Lubricated, which was
rated number two in the survey.
This new brand did fulfill the
packaging requirements, but the
salesman led Bailey to believe
that it was also spermicidal when
it actually was not. Upon dis-
covering this, she dccided to can-
cel tile order and begin looking
elsewhere for a more reliable
product, not to mention salespch
son.

Now that this occurrence has
been brought to light on campus,
those of you who are Nuda Plus
purchasers may want to recon-
sider your use of that product.
This episode is not a case of the
college looking for a cheap solu-
tion and getting burned; Nada
Plus was equal to or greater in
price than the top-rated brands.
Also. neither Bailey nor the
Health Center is at fault in this
incident
