By Erin Rounds for Ted Amann

Ted's really busy this week, so I have
been chosen to write his column, He's
blackmailing me with FRESH sea scallops
from the truck outside McNally's. Certain-
ly an improvement over this creamed
seafood garbage they serve regularly in
Quad (and Cowles. I suppose). There
should be a law against calling things‘that
have never seen ocean water SEAfood.
Truth in advertising m tankfood. Or
maybe lakefood.

Anyway, Ted is really bogged down
because professors keep insisting he take
tests on their lectures (even requiring
RESERVE READINGS), the Joint Board
Senators repeat each other and stretch the
meetings out to two hours, he still has come
mittee interviews to do, he has to “enter
tain” me, and he has a radio show to
prepare for (Yazgur’s Farm/Dead Air on
Sunday nights 942 7 it you’re not familiar
with it, listen to it on Sunday. It'll certainly
be more entertaining than this column. or
you could blow off his show and listen to
MINE Monday nights from 5-9. Unlike
some other dj’s, i play music made in this
decade. And thanks to Andy for trusting
me to show up after my escapades last
semester).

Now for business: if you have any ideas
for a painting scheme for the Pub area, or
a name for it (Gardner Pub will not do)
drop a note in the SGA box, V72. And if you
know who the thieves are who are ripping
off soda cans (translated for
Midwesterncrs. pop cans) irom South
Campus dorms, send a note to the same
box. Judicial action is likely if we can iden-
tity the perpetrators, it seems the culprits
stole cans from Loose 2nd on two different
occasions. and Read 3rd. James 3rd, and

c

all of Haines this past Friday night
Although some of the victims are seeking
blood in restitution for their losses you
should probably just concern yourselves
with protecting your stash of cans Cans
stacked on ilats are prime targets, as are
cans stored in trash Cans lined with Hef-
lies. The thieves might be entering from
the fire escape, so you might want to close
the door. And keep your cans somewhere
inconspicuous Unless you enjoy iinancing
other people’s beer bashes.

it appears that there have been a lot at
instances of petty thievery so far this year.
People taking books, sweatshirts, jackets,
and other stutt. I'm really disgusted by it,
and hope the admissions office will use this
as an excuse to start mandatory lie detec-
tor testing of all prospective lreshpeople.
Hell, while they're at it, make them submit
to drug tests. too. There are just too many
teetctallers around here anymore

Speaking oi lreshpeople, l was amazed
at the ignorance of my youthiul dormr
mates in Read. While looking for a copy of
the Pretenders first album, I discovered
that many oi them did not know who the
Pretenders we're. These kids need
educatin’. Gotta go to school. . .

There's nothing about Sophie in this
week’s column, so I’ll just mention that
these Read ireshpeople, in addition to hav-
ing the highest SAT's ever, also seem to
hold the record for the lowest ‘Purity
Scores." Even better, their scores seem to
be continuing to decrease. l‘ve been a
ireshperson icur times now, and I’ve never
seen such active (read promiscuous) peo»
ple before, Needless to say, 1 am impress-
ed. lt anyone wants a reierral, see me. But

you have to tell me all the sordid details '

afterwards, since I’rn.not a free woman
and can't find out on my own.

Quiet as a Mouse

By Mickey Muiiley

Lately this campus has been witness to a
great deal of very harsh criticisms about
the new signture — otherwise known as the
”logo with the big lips.”

The vast majority of the comments have
been unjustly critical and stem irom puree
ly subjective perceptions. in my opinion,
few people are looking beyond the
aesthetics oi the new signature to explore
and to understand its purpose,

To begin, the question of “ugliness" is
immaterial. Someone must have liked the
design of the signature because, as we all
know, it won out as the final choice. You
certainly can't please all of the people all
at the time — especially with something
that is a visual perception. Whether or not
you see the single laurel leai as lips,
mating slugs, or whatever else your mind
can conjure up is unimportant. Give me
any symbol or logo and within 30 minutes
I'll list five things it resembles that were
not intended to be conveyed by the
designer,

I’m also annoyed by the pervasive
remarks of devotion to the old logo. It was
nice, but it hasn't been around since old
J.B.’s time. In fact, it hasn’t been around
{or twenty years yet . . . and.it replaced
something else, It‘s funny how in theory
Grinnell College is a liberal institution, yet
in reality so many are so unwilling to be
open to the notion oi change. While I'll
agree that to adopt change tor the sake oi
change isn't too smart, I wlll also Say that

to not even give change fair consideration
is very ignorant and narromeinded.

When 1 came here as a freshman, l was
never particularly impressed with the old
logo, but I got used to it. I'll predict that
within one year's time more than half of
the campus community won’t even
remember that there was an “old” logo.

To those of you who say that Grinnell
College is not a corporation and should not
adopt this signature 7 I'll agree with you
half-way. True. Grinnell College is not a
corporation. If it were, the luxury at being
able to disagree so strongly with policy
would not exist. Still. Grinnell College has
specific markets that it caters to and must
take steps appropriate to increasing
visibility within that market, (Contrary to
what some of you may believe, education
is a business.) Like it or not, it is a fact of
life that looks are often more important
than substance. Quite often, visibility
relies more on what you see than what you
know.

what is the overall purpose oi the new
signature? It is to provide a cohesive and
unilled manner for Grinnell College to
graphically represent itself. The 25 or so
ways used for this graphic representation
in the past convey Grinnell College as
something less than professional. We
should convey quality with quality, not
quantity. We are a iirstclass institution so
we should represent ourselves in an ape
propriately distinct manner

The

Human Element

By Jim uuncaii

You won't find anything ‘bout Sophie
here.

Loud buzzing. Fumbling lingers, Sudden
silence._Loud man,

I tiiially woke up this morning. With a
stutty head. And a scratchy throat. And a
general disgust tor life, mine in particular.

I rolled over on my belly and pulled back
the curtain to peek through bleary eyes at
what i was certain lay beyond. The dreary

Jim Duncan

gray skies. The blustering breezes.

Yup,

I let go of the curtain and rolled back
over and stared at the bare whiteness of
the ceiling. For at least twenty minutes.

Finally l decided to get my act together.
I sat up, swung my legs out from under the
toasty warmth of the covers, and dangled
them,

My bed is lcited, and it's a long, long way
down in the mornings.

As 1 contemplated the suicidal leap and
the biting chill of impact on cold linoleum,
all of the congestion in my soggy brain
drained to my nose. I reached for the toilet

paper automatically, The sneeze seized‘

my body violently and without warning. 1
Convulsed and blew lumps. Ack. The TP
felt like rough sandpaper against my raw
shncz. Colds are messy, disgusting. and
taste funny.

I threw something on and with my arms
full of laundry. trotted down to do the
wash.

It never fails lhal if your hands are 0C7
cupied and you‘re in a public place and you
stifle 3 Sue 9. you‘ll lose conlrol. I've seen
people do i n class. and always the sneeze
returns stronger than ever It iinally cons

quers and Lets'Go, spraying all over the
back of the neck of someone unlucky
enough to be sitting in front

I’d stifled the sneeze — and again and
again and again until I walked into the suds
dell warmth of the laundry room . . . and
stifled it once more.

I set down my basket and Tide. turned to
find an empty machine, and blew, ugh,
everywhere I dug into my pockets quick-
ly. found I had no ’1‘? left in them, and
blew, ugh, everywhere. PPHPHT! Deep
breath. PPHPHT! There was no stopping
them. I grabbed a dirty sock irom atop the
pile and plugged up.

The guy who had been bending over into
a washer on the other side stood staring at
me openly The distaste was written
across his face. “Are you OK?” he asked.

“UH, hub." with a sock over my nose.
my answer sounded strange.

Feeling shower-refreshed, l shuffle-
slouched minutes later into the dining hall
in my tattered, comfortable sweats, plunk-
ed down in a seat scross irom Ashley, and
began eating mechanically.

After hearing a series of sniffles and a
halfrslifled cough, I asked her, “God a
Code too, uh?"

She wiped her nose affirmatively.

We were soon trading cold symptoms the
way. two elderly churchgoing grand-
mothers exchange pie recipes.

The discussion turned. sickeningly, to
spitting. When it was apropriate. say in
running and when it was not, like in class.

"After a coughing lit in the middle ol
Bio. sometimes I just feel like turning and
spilling in the aisle. Not that I would,
because I sit in the front row and everyone
would notice.“ she said grinning. I laugh-
ed,

Tuo sick people. Really sick

I finished my breakfast. Of course. the
ram bran and toast tasted fullny.
