Off-campus study: myths and realities

‘ Offeampus study. or non-study as the case may be. is often an essenr
tial element of the Grinnell Experience, People choose to leave campus
for reasons as diverse as the programs themselves. Most students usual
ly have an interest in the country where they travel while some simply
feel the need to get away from Iowa. what inflows is a selection of
descriptions and reflections of Gi'iiinellians who were Olfrcanipits lust

London ’3
charm

by Steve Alderson

! could begin this article by
stating that GIL is an acronym for
Grinneil-In-London and that every
pub in Britian bears scars of this
program, or perhaps thue scars
exist within the alcoholsaturated
recesses of our minds. This of
course is a falsehood. a myth born
in the fragile minds of Tea-users.
In reality, a GIL is a unit of liquid
measure used in the dispension of
shots of whiskey.

Instead, I will begin this article
by stating that the Grinnell-ina
London program is itself a myth
and that of the courses you may
chose. with one exception, all are
inapplicable exercises of the
mind. .

For example, during my iiist
week in London. how was I to
know that one should not take
$3.000 with them shopping in
Soho? This is one of the reasons I
believe the courses Should be
restructured with the object of
making them more relevant.
“Magdalens and Madonnas"
could have easily been transform-
ed into a realrlife. action packed
course that taught us about the
”ins" and “outs" of Soho. As it
was. i never found a Magdalen
nor 3 Madonna.

Another class that could have
been redeSigned was “British
Technology." instead of studying
trains. time machines and the
like. We should have been learn»
ing winning techniques for British
Slot Machines. Without such a
course in the future. I fear that
many more Grinnellians will lose
their hearts and ten-pence pieces
because of these pernicious
machines.

Finally, one course that I would
like to see offered is “British Pop
Culture." Just a little course in
which you would go to pubs and
critique the performances of
groups like Dumpy’s Rusty Nuts.
the Gymslips and King Kurt. it
would be a great experience plus
the college would pay the cover
charge.

But, alas. if the classes were
restructured and the above-
mentioned courses introduced in-
to the curricular. the tun of ex

 

periencing new things would be
lost and that is one at the beautiful
aspects of the Grinnell~ln~London
program. With a little ambition.
every day of the entire semester
can be like walking into a candy
store for the first time. .

The one course that was ap-
plicable to life in London was
“British Theater in
Performance." .You learn how to
hang out in theaters. check your
garments. and neat stuff like that,

For those of you who were not
on the program. parts of this arti~
cle may seem unclear to you.
Since there is no London Support
Group on campus. my only sug—
gestion is to Go.

Sloan ’s
Washington

by Jeffrey Raymond

I was 20 years old. i had my own
apartment in a major city, I was
finally spending a semester away
from this campus and my job was
reporting news and features
stories on Capitol Hill. All in all. I
have to say that this college is
really on to snmethng good with
the Grinnell Technology Semester
in Washington.

As one who firmly believes in
the virtues of off-campus study
and is tantalized by life in D.C . I
jumped at the chance to be a
”guinea pig" on the maiden
voyage of the GTSW program last
semester. Naturally. not
everything was perfect and the
school is going to have to do a bit
of refining on the program, but
most of the Grinnellians who went
to Washington gained from the
trip and are reporting favorably
on it.

if the idea of studying
technology or working in a tech
related job sounds too far remove
ed from your area of interest or
expertise. relax Technology. as
we discovered. is not an entity
with which only a learned few can
deal. Furthermore. the intern-
ships can be tailored to satisfy the
technology requirements and still
reilect your personal interests.

One thing that the college seems
to be doing that l find unfortunate
is limiting the scope of internships
to meet a more defined set of

 

criteria It is possible that by nar-
rowing thc nature of the intern
ships. the school may he ehokinga
program that is just beginning to
grow.

The semestcr itself. though.
in all likelihood the most edukd
tional one you will have while
cnrolled (ll. Grinnell All at us who
\\ cnt last semester were surprised
at the Ideas. values and behavior
of some of our peers, There are a

‘ lot more ways of doing things in

des ~iplions of them, But hoir
many people can say that they
rode past the White House every
day or worked in the Capitol
Building? Lots or people have
seen the Jefferson Memorial. but
how many can tell stories about
Washington's punk clubs or why
the Georgetown bars should be
avoided? You have to live in the
city to really understand it. and
many who come to understand it
iind that they love it.

Washington is a city where
things happen, The new GTsw
program is a great way to ex
perience that city, Even if the bit
about technology scares you. it's
worui putting up with the minimal
classwork just to become a
Washingtonian.
