Students propose.

recreation

by Sam Haber

Today the Board of Trustees will be
presented with a proposal for me construcr
tion of a new student recreational center.
The proposal, co-authored by two students
on the building committee, arose in
response to the imminent renovation of
ARH and the permanent loss of the
auditorium as a movie theater. The inade-
quacy of current party and concert
facilities also prompted the development
oi the proposal.

The reasons for the renovation of ARH
are related to what Professor Lalonde oi
the building commitee called “decades of ‘
deferred maintenance." He emphasized
the general deterioration oi the building by
noting the peeling paint and plaster, the in-
festation by 'nsects, and the poor condition
of the utilities, He also said that the
classrooms needed to be more ﬂexible to
various modes of teaching.

Professor Verette noted “the
mechanical systems of the building are
shot," and as director oi the language lab,
he could not keep disks and cassettes in
rooms where heat constantly was pouring
out of the radiators. On his vision for the
auditorium, he said, “ I can see ARH
auditorium disappearing in order to make
place for a classroom on the main floor
seating 75 with better acoustics and pros
jection capabilities." He also said that the
new auditorium would include a larger
AVV center, and an expanded writing and
reading lab.

ARI-l is tentatively scheduled to be close
ed in the late spring of 1988 and reopened

CCUlCI‘

for the fall oi 1989. in discussing the pro-
posed changes in ARH and the auditorium
in particular, Verrette said that he did not
want to minimize the students' emotional
attachment to the building or the ex—
periences they have had in it, However, he
said that there was “a clash of values”
betwen the students and their experiences,
and the instructors who need better
teaching space and facilities.

Don Smith said that to compensate for
the loss oi the auditorium and the movies
there would be a combination film hall and
lecture hall built in ARI-l,

However, Russ Matteson. a co-author of
the proposal, and SGA president Ali ElSaI-
iar both feel that the students need more
social space. ElSaffar said that
“everybody accepts the iact that we need
more space analogous to ARH " He noted
that Saudi Lounge is not a comfortable
place to see movies, Gardner pub is too
weird, and Darby has too many problems
with the floor and terrible acoustics. He
continued by saying, “Grinnell needs a
place to blow off steam. There's a lot of
academic tension.,.there’s a need to be a
non-student..,We are in Grinnell, iowa and
there’s not much to do,"

Matteson concurred with ElSaitar, sayr
ing that “there’s no decent place on cam-
pus to throw a party.” He outlined the
dimensions of the proposed building,
which he said would have a 500-person
theater, 6000 square feet as a dance floor,
and lsl2rsquare-foot stage. It would also
have a Dolbyquality sound system and
wide theater screen. When it was mention~

Thefts on
south campus

James, Loose burgled

by Jill Petty

One-hundredrlittyrthree dollars in cash
from last weekend's “Booze Cruise”, a
student-sponsored trip to Davenport, was
stolen on Tuesday morning train a South
campus dormitory. Sophomore Dennis
Gerhardstein, treasurer of the Grinnell
Nighthawks Hockey Club, said that the
money was stolen from his room in James
Hall, first ﬂoor “sometime between ll and
12 am," ,

Fiftyrthree students paid three dollars
each to travel to Davenport to watch the
hockey club play a University oi Iowa cir-
cuit team. The money stolen from
Gerhardstein's room would have paid for
the bus rental

Gerhardstein said that his closed door
was not locked while he was out and noted
that a hallmate heard someone knock at
his door around 11:80 am. a time when
the floor was “absolutely dead."

(in Wednesday morning, over $250 was
stolen from live students in Loose Hall. se-
cond and third floors, RHA Jen Shimer
said that two freshmen in the dorm believe
they may have seen the thieves on their
floor. and “they appeared not to be
students." Again, the victims’ doors were
closed but not locked. All of the thefts have
been reported to the Student Affairs Of»
lice,

 

ed that some oi the faculty might object to
the type at party activities to which a new
recreation center would lead, Matteson
said that he hopes the faculty will realize
that “there is academic stress and the
students need a place to go relax, enjoy
themselves, and do something very dit-
lerent than study,“

In general, the administration supported
the need {or alternate student space with
the closing of ARH and the auditorium but
was a little more cautious when discussing
the [ma] outcome. President Drake made
it very clear that “no one questions the
need tor a movie theater and social space

for the students. The question becomes
how best to meet those needs. We have to
satisfy ourselves that there aren't alter-
natives." Drake said he thought me pro-
posal was very thoughtful and that the
students had “done a very good job of con»
verting an analysis of their needs into a
concrete proposal.” However, he said that
the proposal would have to meet “the con-
crete realities of cost”,

Most likely setting the stage (or a trimmr
ing of the proposalrhe said, “Almost any
proposal tends to get trimmed and reduced
when you get into the planning stage and
comparing those plans to available

Wal-Mart: Good for Grinnell?

by Robert Fein

Two years ago this week, Sam Walton
opened in Grinnell what was nearly his
moth store. The $.wosquare-toot Walr
Mart Discount City was manned with ED
“associates,” as the store's employees are
called, and was stocked with 30,000 dif-
ferent items. The BUY NOW AND SAVE!
signs were set in place. and the doors were
opened to townspeople who were eager to
do just that. So eager,'in fact, that in Oc-
tober, 1986. Sam Walton, was named by
Forbes magazine as the wealthiest man in
America, with $4.5 billion.

The “secret" of the Wal-Mart chain, bas-
ed in Bentonvillc, Arkansas, is the loca-
tions at the stores, 80% of which are in
towns oi tewer than is,ooo people. Since
small-town retailers can not match the
chain's' high-volume buying, Wal-Mart
tends to dominate the area’s market. In
some towns, a new Wal-Mart has meant
the end of the downtown business districts
prosperity.

The Grinnell store’s second anniversary
will not be celebrated by Betty Hammond,
owner oi the Wood Wax 'n Paper sta~
tionery store on Main Street. Like many of
Grinnell’s downtown merchants, she is not
too thrilled with Sam Walton’s success,
“it’s kind of a sore subject wiui me,” she
said, “If I can possibly get what lwant up
here, 111 buy it up here, I've never been in
the store.

“It doesn‘t bother me a bit when so-
meone starts up here in town,” she said. ”l

Harold Hanson, owner of the Ben
Franklin franchise on Main Street, said he
feels “that it WalrMart chose Grinnell.
with their expertise, diey apparently ielt
that Grinnell has a lot of potential.” He
believes, however, that' Grinnell’s
downtown “will be all right. I don’t think
people are impressed by magnitude of
display. I think people are more impressed
with personal service. I think that means
- more to people."

But someone must be impressed with
magnitude of display. In 1986, consumers

in 23 states spent $11 billion at WalrMart
stores. And the discount cities are
multiplying, with about 115 new stores be»
ing opened yearly,

Gary c-oldammer, manager oi the Grin-
nell Wal-Mart, thinks that a big store
should be welcomed in a small town. “Is
WalrMart good {or small towns? well, you
tell me. Do you like our prices? Do you
want to save money? We enjoy competir
tion. We don’t mean to come into a town
and take it over ~ we come into a town and
otier the consumer variety and price and

 

know we've got to have more than one I.
tore. Competition doesn’t hurt you, but.

cleanliness and cheerful people, and we
give it to them in their locality instead of
having to drive to Des Moines or a metro
area to do it. We‘re bringing the selection
of a metro market to the consumer in a
small area.

“Our philosphy? We just treat our
customers right. We’re on the philosophy .
of everyday low price," Mr. Goldammer
said.

The image of the store as a rich outsider,
a view which manager Goldammer par»
ticularly dislikes, took root two years ago,
even before Hie store had opened. In order
to procure some cash quickly to tinance
the store's opening, $1,690,00oworth oi
interestriree bonds were sold by WalrMarl
through the Grinnell city administration
oiiice.

City manager Ted Clausen explained,
“These were industrial revenue bonds,
sold on the open market. The arrangement
is that the bond is sold through the city so
that it has the benefits of a municipal
bond; the interest that Wal-Mart pays goes
directly to the holder, who doesn’t pay in-
come tax on the interest he earns." The
bond's holder was not listed in the city of~
{ice's records. '

“Municipal bonds, ior years, have been
exempt irom this tax. The federal govern»
ment made these arrangements to allow
cities and counties to do something to help
industry expand," Mr. Clausen said.

Betty Hammond, owner of Wood Wax 'n
Paper, said that she objected to
WalrMart's opening, “especially when
they bonded them why they ever did it, i
do not know. I guess that’s what really
bothers me. We had a hardware store that
was struggling and had to close 7 they
didn’t offer them any money. And there
