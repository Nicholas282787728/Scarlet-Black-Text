Much oi the $1674 of damage which
occurred on the Grinnell campus trom
January 17 to March 2 was inflicted by
students themselves, according to
Dean of the College Wally Walke ‘

As tuition rises and inflation rises,
the issue oi campus property damage
becomes a concern tor the college
community. This issue ranges from
the damage itself and its effects on the
campus community to what can be
done about the situation.

A large portion oi the vandalism
damage this semester is due to
damaged light polcs hehiiid Goadnow

and a broken Forum window. Must of
the remainder is accounted tor by
damage in the dorms, which not only
[ace the cost of normal wear and tear
and malicious acts, but are often
deprived oi their lounge furniture by
students who borrow it for the
semester.

The results of vandalism and bore
l'owmg around campus and in the
dorms are personal as well as
monetary. Reparation oi dorm van-
dalism is paid [or by hall funds while
reparation of vandalism outside the
dorms is covered by campus
budgeting. For instance, the library's

budget for book replacement is $1000 a
year, which does not include the per
sonnel costs of tracing these losses. No
matter which budget the reparation
money comes from, the costs are paid
by the students through higher tuition,
room, board, and activity fees.
Although campus borrowing does
not directly aiiect student pocket-
books, it does have great impact. Bor~
rowed lounge furniture is used by the
borrowee only and deprives the ma
jority of dorm residents of its use.
