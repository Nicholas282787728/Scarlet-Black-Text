Frazer clariﬁes academic requirements

by Steve Burnett

When Executive VicePresident Wal»
ly Walker bumped his head on a hang-
ing television set in Science 171 at the
faculty meeting last Monday, someone
quipped, “Those TVs are expensive to
replace.”

That was one of the few light
moments at the one hour and 40 minute
assembly, ﬁlly of those minuta were
devoted to a debate on the proposed
changes in the definition and classiﬁca-
tion of students' “normal academic
progress."

“Normal progress" is a nebulous

term, and Dean of the Faculty
Catherine Frazer said that too many
students are under the wrong impres-
sion as to what it is. The definition at
normal progress can be lound on pages
2041 of the Student Handbook.
However, Frazer felt that the wording
was not clear enough.
. At the meeting, she proposed an
amended version, which consists oi a
greater explanation of how Advanced
Placement (AP), transfer, and sum-
mer school credits are used and a
paragraph explairung that a grade
point average is not sufficient in deter-
mining normal progress (unless it dips
below 2.0).

Althoughi is not clear from the pre
sent wording in the handbook. the cur»
rent policy is that AP, transfer, and
summer school credits may be used
towards graduation, but not. towards
determining normal progress. Also,
students are expected to take 16 credits
a semester (with the possible excep
tions of ' t semester freshmen and
those petitioni earlier to take fewer).

misunderstandings.

Since Grinnell does not have an 1“
grade and does have a Pass/No Credit
option, grade point averages, as Frazer
said, "are useless in determining nor-
mal progress." Hence, the Committee
on Academic Standing has only one
criterion, which is credits. Frazer said,
“Students here are expected to be lull-
time students, and that means taking 16
credits a semester." In other words,
students signing up lot or dropping
down to 12 crediB will probably be
hearing from the Committee on
Academic Standing informing them
they are in academic trouble.

The faculty still did not totally ap-
prove ol me new wording and voted to
accept it on the condition that the Coma
mittee do more work on the statement,

As a side note of the discussion, one at
the (acuity members complained that
the Committee cannot use grade point
averageS‘in determining normal pres
gress because of the “ludicrous” situa
tion or no F-grade. He drew applause.

Another proposal put forth was a

change in the rules for choosing
members (it the DiVision Personnel
Committee oi the Executive Councll
This committee determines who
receives tenure. The change would
allow only tenured laculty on the com»
mittee, and it any department has no
tenured members. it would receive no
representation. There was some discus
slim, but because too many people who
were very interested in the issue could
not attend the meeting, the vote was
postponed until Dec. 15.

Also, Professor RA. Luebben oi the
Pit. Committee asked ior approval oi a
plan to expand the Midwest Collegiate
Athletic Conlerence lMCACt from ll to
14 teams. Luebben said three colleges
have not yet been asked to Join, but he
wanted "itacultyl approval or disap-
proval . . . before any iormai move is
made by the Faculty Athletic
Representatives." He explained that ii
lqrteani conierence would save money
and retain the "integrity or the MCAL’ ”
The iaculty unanimously approved the

proposal.

Meeting emphasizes Court rulings

by Anne Rowland

'About a dozen people met at South
Lounge Tuesday evening to discuss the
fate of those males born in 1962 who
must sign-up for the dralt on Jan'. 5. 0n~
ly about one-quarter at those present
were eligible for the up-coming
registration.

The participants, one-half of which
were women, addressed several issues,
including the constitutionality of
registration, Concientious objector

(C0) status, and whether or not
registrants are required to list their
Social Security number.

One of the participants asked it the
current registration project might be
ruled unconstitutional because it
discriminates against men, Jelt’rey
Montague, one of the counselors pre
sent, noted that the United States
Supreme Court had announced Monday
its intention to hear a case alleging
discrimination. However, Montague
pointed out that the case was not
scheduled until next spring or summer
and thus will not affect the January
registration

Members of the group also addressed
the recent decision by the Supreme
Court declaring the use of Social Securtv
ty numbers on the registration cards
unconstitutional. Because of the Court‘s
recent ruling, January applicants are
not required to list the SS number.
However, the government wrll retain
those numbers already listed unless
registrants request to have them
removed. ,

During discussion on CO, several
points were brought out. First, C0
status will not be conferred unless the
government actually calls for a dralt.
But those thinking or requesting co
status should being preparing anyway
because they must prove that their ob~
jections predated a call to arms.

Dennis Haas, another draft
counselor, explained that among other
requirements, at least three letters of
recommendation must be submitted.
These letters may come lrom a
religious leader or any person who is
well aquainted with the applicant.
