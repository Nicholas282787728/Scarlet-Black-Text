SP and R Building

by Vincent Presser

Talk about biting the hand that
ieeds you! But, let's tace it, nobody
is overwhelmed by the beauty oi
the architecture oi the student
Publications and Radio building,
and it's not that well-constructed a
building. What more can I sayv
Well, the important thing to notice
about it is dial it covers up a
greceiul arch that stands at the
center oi the South Campus loggia.
This is very disiiguring. A lumpish
building now blocks the lovely are
chitecture (which I'm sure now
goes unnoticed). The arch, stan-
ding grandly, with oldrfashioned
electric globes at its sides, provid-
ed a iocus tor the loggia. But now
we have the SP and R building,
which does not invite the eye but
repels it. While the arch puncA

SP and R budding instead inter-
rupts it. And, irom inside the log-
gia, we now have an area that is
signiiicantly darkened and
ugliiied.

No excuses can be made ior place
ing a building there. Hell, putting a
structure there without bothering
to unite it with the surrounding are
chitecture is as bad as, say, putting
a box on top or Burling. Looking at
the plans {or What is now the SP
and R building, the administration
doubtless said. “Well, it's for stu-
dent government, so placing it in
the middle of the loggia will make
it very student-accessible."

Since the people in charge do
NOT have talent or training for the
decisions that they’re being asked
to make (having gotten their pre-
sent johs through means unrelated
to competence ior, or understanr
ding oi, the committees on which
they come to serve tr they should be
more willing to listen to opposing
viewpoints. After all, that's What
keeps people on their toes. The
trouble is that the administration
here gets a lot less criticism than
the administrations at larger
schools 7 there aic simply iewer
people here who can give them
grief. But that's no excuse for their
complacency and insensitivity.
They should expect criticism more
and more in the iuture, because ii
we really expect Grinnell to ever
become first-rate, administrators
should be required to maintain
higher standards than they have in
the past. We could certainly use
higher standards as far as ar-
chitecture is concerned.
