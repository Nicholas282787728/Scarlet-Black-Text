It is Crucial that We continue to work
~reativety and positively to help our school
lay its part in ending apartheid. Members
i the Senior class have the opportunity to
donate to the South African Scholarship
Program. Each graduate who walks
across the stage with a red ribbon has
donated at least $4.00 to the Scholarship.
We are asking parents of graduating
seniors to donate the balance 0! their conti-
nuing enrollment deposit to the Scholar
s 'p Program. Any other donations to the
South African Scholarship fund would be
welcome. Having more black South
African students on campus will enhance
the cultural diversity at Grinnell as well as
give those students a chance to gain the
tools they need to overcome oppression in
their own nation,

Donations can be sent to President
Drake's office. or made at the bookstore. if
