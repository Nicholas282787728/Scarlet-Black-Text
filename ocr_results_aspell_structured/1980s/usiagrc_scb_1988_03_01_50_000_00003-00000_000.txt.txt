Chris Gunsi.

I'm running for the ofﬁce‘oi’
vice President of 5.0 A. I‘m
rnnning because I think in. the
best for the job. I have expe-
rience in S.G.A. and have ideas
.which,ormbotlrbcneﬁtial to the
Student Body, as a whole. and
are plausible and realistic, I’m
not going to promise you the
Sun (is A full week of butter
days) but, I'm going to do every.
thing within the power oi'S.G.A
to better your years here aca-
dernically and socially. Through
my experiences within S.G.A. I
have become familiarired with
its intricacies.

My Experience in s.G.A con.
sists of:

- 2years as a member of the
Student Building Committee. -
2 years as a member of the ARH
faculty/administratiou/student l
ovation Committee . a year serve
ing on the Committee of Stu.
dent life - l have also served
on both Election board and the
New Student Days Committee

My Ideas

1. Core Curriculum» we must
say NO to the faculty and ad-
ministration. There are too
many problems in attempting to
ﬁnd “Core" classes that will sat-
isfy everyone‘s needs, especially
in an environment of shrinking
amounts of class otterings due
to the implementation of the 3.
2 program without the hiring of
new faculty.

2. The 3.2 program and
the hiring of new faculty- The
faculty changing its teaching
load from 3-3 to the 3-2 is
understandable, but we NEED
MORE FACULTY. r can't ac-
cept the ideas of cutting out
classes (especially in the area
of Women’s Studies, where the
Women’s History Chair may he
left vacant after this year.) and
having larger classes. in my
eyes, that is lessening the qual.
ity of the Grinnell education.

Statements

Vice-Presidents

3 Butler Days. We all know
that crinnell give us nn in-
credible workload, especially in
ﬁnals weeks, The need for
Butler Days is unquestionable,

The Half Bnﬂ‘er Day proposaJ
is good, but I iltink YOU DE-
SERVE AT LEAST AN EN-
TIRE DAY AND I WON'T
ACCEPT ANYTHING LESS
THAN THE HALF-BUFFER
DAY PROPOSAL.

4. The sports Teams The
idea of Grinnell's football team
being disbanded has been ﬁoat-
ing around campus. This is very
bad. I believe that Griunell Col—
lege should offer every opportu-
nity to every student that it _can
give and it should never with.
draw opportunities to anyone. is
it there.

Six candidates running for
SGA viceepresidentil What
does the Vicc.president even do?
Who‘s the best qualified? And
why should 1 vote for Rob Kil-
lion?

The SGA viceepresident is the
student representative to the
administration and faculty on
curriculnrn issues and, if any
good, is the one student who
is in the best position to efs
fect change. To do this, the
Vice-president must have lead»
crship skills, appropriate experi~
once, and clearly deﬁned goals. 1
believe i have what it takes to be
the best, most effective student

representative, Since next year'

will see the implementation of
the 3.2 faculty course load. fac-
ulty shortages, and likely revival
of proposals to impose a stricter
core curriculum, students must
be well represented in each de-
bate.

Leadership skills, experience,
and clearly deﬁned goals go
hand in hand. An inspira
tional lcader is great, but un.
familiarity with the new posi-
tion means valuable time will
be lost learning to do the job.
I believe l have the required
leadership skills in addition to
SGA experience. we been the
SGA Administrative Coordina—
tor (Joint Board agenda pack.
ets, other exciting stuff), chaired
the Election Board (organizing
senatorial elections and initia-
tive votes), served as a vounker
Hall Senator, and have served on
the Committee on Student Life,
the Initiative Fund Committee,
and last, but certainly not least,
the Library/Bookstore Commit-
tee. In these varied positions, I
have established and maintained

excellent working relationships
with members of the Adminis
tration and others in SGA. Most
importantly, I've seen ﬁrst hand
what the current Vicespiesideut,
Ali Elsatrar, does, and am thor.
oughly aware of the responsibi i.
ties and huge time commitment
the job entails. My point is, I
have the leadership skills to cf.
fectivcly represent students, and
have the experience that will al-
low me to do it. And i know

what someone with a working
knowledge of the job can ac.
complish as Vicecpresident. Bee
cause of these qualiﬁcations, 1
can avoid the initial semester of
unfamiliarity with the position
and will be ready and able to
begin working on the following
goals the day 1 our elected:

1) I would strongly oppose the
implementation ota stricter core
curriculum, 2) I will lobby the
administration for an additional
faculty increase after

the initial year of the 3.2 pro.
gram 3) l will work to reduce
the costs of Bookstore iteuis and
have already

started the process in the Lie
brary/Bookstorc Committee. 4)
1 will continue to work with the
Women Studies Concentration
Committee

and student groups to develop
a Women's Studies concentra.
tion. 5) With the president, I
will prepare an SGA handbook
that will be a re-

source for those wanting to be.
come involved in SGA or need
ing infor—

mation on planning parties or
obtaining budgets. s) with the
Cabinet, r will restructure the
Films and Concerts Corrnnittees

to allow more student input,
Four other Cabinet members
and myself have

traveled to Cornell College
and the University of lowa to re
search their

programs. We've already
written the first draft of the new
strutllue,

I‘m excited about the changes
that will be happening next
year, and about the role SGA
can play in those changes. And
l believe I am the candidate
best prepared to represent slu—
dent interest. I have been com.
mitted to SGA for the past two
years because, believe it or not,

. r enjoy it! So please, on March
9, give me, Rob billion, the op-
portunity to continue that corn-
mitment next year as your vice.
president.

Siephanie Redman.

My name is Stephanie Red-
man. I am a junior English ma.
jor, and I want to be SGA vice-
President on, so what? Do

I have a power complex? Do I
have billions of free hours that I
want to ﬁll? Do 1 have delusions
and think I’m Ali EISaﬂ'an’ The
answer to all of the above clues.
tions is “no." The reason I do
want to be SGA Vice—President
is simple. i care about this col.
lege, especially about what hap»
pens to its students and its aca-
demics,

Fine and dandy, you say. But
Steph, you add, good inten.
tions do not a viceepresident
make Dear reader, you are
correct. Appropriate rlualificrr
tions for a good vicevpresident
include sound ideas, experience,
and dedication to the job, all of
which I have.

It is imperative that any SGA
candidate be {siniliar with SGA
and its workings. Since my
freshman year, I‘ve been in.
volved in SGA in some capac.
ity, ﬁrst as an observer, then as
a senator for a veal, as a Illrlll-
ber of Finance Committee for
three selllestsrs. and t-urrenllv
as chairperson of the Student
Publications and Radio ('oms
nlittee (SP and H). 'vs Erwn how
SGA works, and Ike learned to
effectively work within its stlnf—
titre.

Well, OK, but what about
ideas? Speciﬁcally, I‘d like to
continue the work being done on
buffer days. Student input dur—
ing next year's transition to a.
2 will be crucial, and I would
like to represent campus views
regarding potential areas of im.
provemeut in the faculty and
curriculum. While there is little
that can be done about 3-2 for
next year, it is vital that student
views are represented when the
faculty and administration are
planning for the years ahead. rn
addition to the ideas I have, I'd
like to tackle ideas and concerns
that you have,

While we are all concerned
about these issues, there is a
limit to how much input stu.

dents have. Because our in-
put on things such as curricu»
lum and other academic issues
is often marginal, it is impor-
tant that the person represent.
ing students be both familiar
with and conﬁdent in working
with Grinnell's administration
and faculty. My involvement
with SGA and my term as chair.
person of SP and R has put me
in close contact with the admin
istration. Thus, I do feel conﬁ—
dent and comfortable talking to
and negotiating with faculty and
administration.

In addition to experience and
ideas, I have dedication. I want
to serve this student body. I’ve
been doing so for the past two
years and I want to continue in
a greater, niore productive ca-
pacity. I want to be SGA Vires
President, and with your help,
I can do the job well. 1 urge
you all to read the statements
and interviews. Attend the can-
didate forums Decide who you
want representing your views.
The decision is yours, and 1
hope you will trust my abilities
and Choose me for the position
of your SGA Vice»President.

Tom Worth.

Unlike the ViceePresident of
the United States, the SGA
vice-President has speciﬁc re»
sponsibilities. while the SGA
President deals with social is-
sues, the v.1). deals with aca—
demic issues. specifically, the
V.I’. represents the students in
the college‘s academic commit-
tees.

At $14,030 a year (and rounlr
ing), students have a right to
take part in the curricular de.
cisions. The [act that the 3/2
proposal passed without a (or
responding increase in faculty
demonstrates how little input
the students have. I want us to
get the best out what the college
(and its turricnlulnl has to offer

Having been on my depart.
mental Educational Policy Com.
mittee (EPC) and the Student
council on Curriculum (which
the V.P. chairs), I am familiar
with the issues. I know which
changes are realistic and which
are not. And I know what the
job of VP. entails. I have ins
volved myself heavily in the aca-
demic issues betause I am a con—
cerned student and becnnse I p“,
joy it.

One part of the job that is of-
ten overlooked is the V.P.'s re-
sponsibility to take cases to Ju-
dicial Council (JudCo). JndCo
hearings are highly structured
and difﬁcult to handle at ﬁrst.
It takes time to learu‘the rules
and be effective, The “learning
by doing“ approach is not good
when a student is brought be-
fore JudCo with his or hu future
at Grinnell on the line. Having
served two years on JudCo (one
of them as chairperson), I feel I
can do a competent job from the
beginning.

A few of my goals as VP, are
as follows: 1) the adoption of
the Student Designed luterdis»
ciplinary Concentration 2) help-
ing Student Educational Policy
Committees get more involved
in faculty decisions 3) move the
Pass/Fail deadline back 4) get
more faculty employed. My
goals will be explained later on
in this newspaper and will be
posted on your nearest both-
roorrl stall.

As a student, I know what
needs to be changed and I have.
the experience to make those
changes. Have a nice day.
