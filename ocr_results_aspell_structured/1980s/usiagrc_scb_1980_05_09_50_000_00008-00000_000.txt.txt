Students aren’t
apathetic

To the editor: I've been hearing a lot
of talk about student apathy lately,
brought on by the lack of attendance
at President Drake's inauguration
While student apathy is perhaps one
cause of the poor attendance, ldon't
think that it is the main cause. I think
that the time chosen for the inaugura»
tion was unfortunate. At 11 o'clock on
Sunday morning, most of the students
that aren’t hung over or asleep are in
church, Instead oi blaming the people,
especially students, that didn’t make
it to the ceremony, perhaps we should
applaud the ones that did. Sunday
morning is not a good time tor
anything. Had the inauguration been
held Sunday atternoon, chances are
that attendance would have been
much better.

We don't have an apathetic student
body. Attendance at activities from
Medieval Combat lo Folk Dancing are
at their highest levels and are Still
growing. while the turnout {or both the
Republican and Democratic cauc s
were substantial ollle events iillll '
