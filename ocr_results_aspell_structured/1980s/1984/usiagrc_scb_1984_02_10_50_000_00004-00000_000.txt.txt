Topics to consider With the trustees

The Board of Trustees of this school has only limited ac-'
cess to this campus and the studens who work, live and
play here, so this weekend provides some needed ex-
posure to the college community.

What are the issues here in Winter, 1984, with which ﬁle
trustees should concern themselves? Many ideas will be
discussed today at an open meeting at 4:30 in die Main
Lounge, but perhaps the Board members (and students)
would like to start thinking about these ideas.

Firstin the still unresolved problem involving Activities
Councelor Georgia Dentel. The administration, in an ef-
fort to reduce expenses through payroll cuts, has decided
that Dentel can work what almost amounts to her present
full-time job at only half her persent salary, Just two days
ago, Dentel had another fruitless, unsatisfactory meeting
with President Drake and Dean of Student Affairs James
Tederman. About the only positive measure that came
from the meeting was an extension of the deadline for ac-
cepting or rejecting the administration’s contract, which
had been set for today.

Surely there is room in the budget for this institution to
pay for a full-time activities counselor. Georgia Dentel is
a 23-year employee who does her job well and is asking
nothing outrageous. Even when enrollment falls slightly
(and it is actually higher this semester than last), the job
of procuring quality entertainment does not get any
easier.

Another issue that is making news is the continuing cur-
riculum debate. After almost everyone except'JB. Grin-
nell himself found the original proposal by Professor Mor<
ris Parslow unacceptable, other proposals (some more
formal than others) have come forward.

One of the most recent drafts, this one by History Pro»
fessor Alan Jones, seems more sensible. Few of us are in
favor of required courses of programs of study, but the
Jones Proposal calls more for a solid, reasoned structure
to the overall curriculum. For too long Grinnell has lacked
a truly integrated, sensible approach toward gently, in-
telligently guiding students toward a real liberal arts
education. This proposal may start to change that.

The trustees should also concern themselves with
organizing a communications department at Grinnell.
The study and practice of communication is an important
part of the liberal arts process as it allows one’s carefully
formed ideas to be presented to others. For some reason,

Welcoming graffiti

Like the swallows to Capistrano and trout to the stream
of their birth, graffiti has once again returned to the walls
of the Burling bathrooms. There isn’t all that much scrib-
bled down there yet, but three weeks into the semester
there are already lists, witt' isms and pictures. Unless
B&G adds extra clean-up detail to patrol the library, the
graffiti is certain to prosper.

The content and form 'of the graffiti, it would seem, has
changed somewhat over the years to reflect the changes
in moods and lifestyles here at Grinnell, but one constant
has been the appearance of die graffiti itself. It is not
stretching things to say that Burling Graffiti is in fact part

this college has seen to it that its resources are directed
away from this area. ‘

One aspect of Grinnell that would immediately feel the
benefits of communications curriculum is the media. The
Scarlet and Black and KDIC would automatically im»
prove in quality because there would be more people in-
terested and qualifed to make the effort to work on them.
Too many people come here interested in the media but
lose interest because the media are so loosely organized.
It’s about time this issue is addressed.

The final issue to be dealt with in this space is money: if
Grinnell College has so much of it, why are so many peo-
ple in so many departments apparently doing without? It
is the job of the trustees to be frugal with the College’s
money, but there are too many worthy plans that aren’t
getting the backing they need. The observatory and the
new laboratory at the Biology Preserve are good ex-
amples of the benefits of wise spending.

The time is now to take some of this school‘s huge en-
dowment and put it into some constructive ventures. We
can understand saving for a rainy day, but it is already
drizzling and it could soon become a storm.

back to Burling

of the Grinnell Experience.

For the most part, the graffiti is harmless. Nobody‘s
reputation is going to be made or lost by what somebody
writes on a bathroom stall. Furthermore, any record left
by a pen~wielding wag on a study break can be removed
from the public view by the use of another'pen.

More importantly, having one’s name go up in ink
(nobody has their name go up in lights anymore) is a
status symbol. It is quite likely that many people would
just as gladly be included in a “10 Best” list as on the
Dean‘s List. When it comes to stature in the college com-
munity, Burling bathroom walls are the places to see and
be seen.

There is the argument against graffiti that says it is
vandalism, and vandalism is wrong. Technically this is a
perfectly good contention. But the defacement of the
carefully scrubbed walls can be removed and the walls
made clean again. No property is actually destroyed.

Another reason why die graffiti is good is that there are
some ideas that simply can be best expressed on a
bathroom wall. Seldom are these ideas gripping in their
force or importance, but they are often relevant to Grin-
nell and promote further thought. Last week’s column on
feminism, for example, was inspired by some prose writ-
ten in Burling.

The bottom line (no pun intended) is that there is, and
should always be, a place for graffiti in Burling. Its poten»
tially damaging effecs are vastly outweighed by its
thought-provoking, entertaining effects. of course, more
people will read the personals in the Scarlet and Black
than Burling Graffiti, but the walls of the bathroom do not
havea Wednesday deadline.

Run,

Ronnie,

run '

by John Sburbzro

Last week President Ronald
Reagan announced his decision to
seek anomer term in office. Here
at the college more was a feeling
of despair, but across the nation
quite another feeling prevailed:
that of hope. It was as if Reagan's
birthday celebration had started
early, the nation was euphoric.

For all his faults, and being
human, he does have his fair
share, Ronald Reagan is not such
a bad guy. Granted, some of his
policies do appear to benefit the
rich more than they do the poor,
but in the final analysis everybody
comes out ahead.

Take the example of inflation.
Upon entry into oiiicc it was
hovering around 12.4 percent, now
it stands at 3.3percent. Inﬂation is
non-discriminatory. it strikes the
educated as well 'as the
uneducated, black as well as
white, and die poor as well as the
rich, One is hard pressed to find
the logic of former administrar
tions which doled out money to the
poor in an effort to keep their
miserable standard of living on
par with inﬂation.

Feminists argue, and par-
ticularly remaining ERA sup
porters, that Reagan patronizes
them and is unsympathetic to
their objectives. Possibly he d.-
“paironize” them, however Lh
man is 73 years old and it should
come as no surprise that he does
not see problems in the sam
“strange" way that many
feminists understand them

And as for the argument thath-
is unsympathetic to their cause,
one ponders just what Reagan
would have to do in order to ge
their approval. Unofficial surveys
find that a Presidential appoint
merit ratio of two women to every
one man would meet wiﬂ’l their
demands, however 1 am sui-
these numbers are inflated an-
that many fine upstanding wome
would stand for a controlling ma
jority of only 51 percent.

Finally other critics argue tha
deficit spending is running the na
tion amuck. There is a lot of tru
to this statement, but can any
reasonable person really believ-
that the Democrats will resolv-
it’! After all, it was the Democra ~
that started this nation on th
deficit spending road, and i
history is to provide any guide
when elected they will continue it

But that is all in the future. ‘ ~
for now it appears that Reagan’
only opposition will come iro
Walter Mondale, A presidentia
candidate Who has promise-
every thing to every special in
terest group in the nation. But a
an opposi 'on candidate, should h
not be politically astute enou
not to choose a woman or Jess
Jackson as his running mate, wh
has the potential to make the :-
elections very close?

Heedless of the November elec
tion, this country will always‘ -:
indebted to Ronald Reagan. For i

,was this man who brought an ai

of respectability back to th.
presidency, this man that face
tough and often misguided npposi
tion in the Congress, and it wa
this President who made i
respectable tor little Chip Smit
down the street to Claim: “Ya
know Tim, this isn’t such a ba.
country.”
