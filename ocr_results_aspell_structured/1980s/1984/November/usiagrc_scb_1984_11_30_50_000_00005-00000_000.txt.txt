Mexico: maintaining
stability under pressure

by i-‘rit tireen

It Is no Secret that the US, ex
erts tremelldous influence on the
economy oi Mexico. Until recent
ly, however, Mexican iorcign
policy approached the conllici in
Central America irom a position
independent oi the Reagan ad
ministration. In the last six nlonr
ths Mexico has modified its
ioreign policy in part because oi
its dependency on the US, to
restructure its debt.

Mexico has maintained a
remarkable degrce of political
stability.

most significant outcome 01' the
Revolution: it legislated a

A view from the outside

tip-Marcelo 'l‘ri\ on

Now that Reagan has yion.
many Latin Americans iccl that
tour more years oi harsh ioreign
policy will iollnw, vthy‘? During
his iirst term. Reagan directed
the invasion ol Grenada (and has
consequently been accused oi ht"
ing imperialistici. has supported
the internal your going on in
Nicaragua and helped to make it
widespread.

Reagan has also marred the
U S. image in South Anieric by
supporting the aggressor during
the Falklands war. A diplomatic
commission. led by Alexander
llaig. was sent to Argentina. so
that its then corrupt military dic»
tators-hip believed that the u
would be its ally, The contraiy
turned out to be true. and. as a
consequence. the British had the
big advantage or being provided
with useful information irom U S.
satellites (location and size (it are
rules in the Falklands.) Reagan
thus has violated the 'l'lAK
{Treatise at lntel'anlerican
Reciprocal Assistancci and
rendered the Organization oi
American States lOASi complete-
ly useles As the midon member
oi this UN hianch. tlic ' .going

against the purpose ol the total
organization means that il has
been shattered.

As tar as anterlilcl’lcalls ziru
concerned. there are a consider

able amount in Latin America.
Three countries (Mexico. Brazil
and Argentina) seem to blame the
magnitude oi their ioreign debts
to the oppression and abuse oi the

may he the reason that them is a
lirm ground lor Communism in
most oi the underveloped Latin
America The lower classes ieel
that they have been cheated by
the U.S. and they tend to be more
lenient to the Soviet Union.

How much at these ready-made
opinions are yustiiied‘z ilovt much
do we owe to Reagan. and up to
vihat extent can he be blamed‘!
There is an example that can help
to understand Reagan‘s- [at-elgn
policy in Latin America. In South
Ameri tor instance there was.
during c rter's administration, a
strong policy extremely critical oi‘
human rights, Argentina and
Chile there condemned be use ol
their brutally repressive systems.
Reagan has a dii’ierent approach.
The question oi human rights is
not considered that mucll. but, in-
stead. it is assigned a role uhich is
more realistic. why. itir example.

equally useless olynipic Boycott,

As a conclusion. Reagan should
ntlt be treated as a scapegoat. His
i'oreign policy is strong and more
realistic ill the sense that it admits
that there is an antagonistic
power and some coactive
measures should be adopted. Most
oi these readyrmatle opinions

Latin America is politically Imr
