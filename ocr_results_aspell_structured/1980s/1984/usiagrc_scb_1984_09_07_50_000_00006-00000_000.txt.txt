Football

“We won't accept anything less
than winning." On that note Head
Football Coach John Martinek
echoes what the team 7 and the
ians 7 have probably been
waiting to hear ior some time.

why will this year be better
than those past? According to
Martinek, “We have a better
squad. There's more depth. more
talent, and the team is more goal-
oriented towards winning than
they've ever been.”

while racing a tougher schedule
this season, Martinek still beieves
his Pioneers are Capable oi play
ing at the level oi any team on the
schedule. He declined to make
any deiinite predictions, although.
he said they’re going to “play the
games one at a time."

With a 47-man squad, Martinek
doesn’t have the numbers that
he'd like. But the team’s depth
and attitude help to make up ior
its lack of size.

“We are better at every spot
this year,” noted Martinek, and
added, “Our offensive line [led by
ireshman quarterback Rob
Lough] is much stronger and
more talented than last year, and
our defense should continue to
play good, solid football.”

Martinek pointed out the team’s
attitude has an additional plus. He
said, “The upperclassmen on the
squad are survivors of rocky
years 7 they want to be part oi a
turnaround situation.”

The “dedicated
upperclassmen, along with the
“gung-ho freshmen." result in
what Mariinek terms a “positive
chemistry,"

The team goes head-to-head
with Macalasier tomorrow. there
at 1:30 p.m.l. in their first game of
the season,

Since Macalaster is new to the
conierence this year. Martinek is
somewhat unsure as to the type oi
team they are. But ii the Pioneers
can put some oi that “positive
chemistry' to work, they just
might find the formula [or we
cess.

Soccer

By Heidi Louis

Will the Men's Soccer Team
have a winning season? Accdrr
ding to Coach John Pfitsch. the
team is not as strong as last year's
team was after a week of practice.

Pfltsch feels the main reason
the team is not as strong as last
year‘s team is because of the loss
oi Gregory Donovan. who
graduated last year. Donovan. the
team’s goalie. was a fourryear let
terman,

“It will be difficult to match the
skill of that defense,” explained
Pfitsch. saying that there are no
goalies who are presently as skillr
ed as Donovan,

However, Pfitsch stressed that
the team has only been practicing
since Augusl 25, and because of
the freshmen's active involve
ment in New student Days, he
hasn't seen their full potential. . .

,1, Pitisch said oi the ireshman
‘Vplayers, “They seem to '. got

i stronger every year; but the sport,

Women’s
Cross Country

With an unusually large number
of runners this year. the Women's
Cross Country Team is iacing |he
new season with high expecta
tions.

According to Coach Evelyn
Freeman, 35 women started the
season and. despite the expected
attrition rate associated with
every sport, “everyone has stuck
with it so far.”

Besides the high level of par
ticipation, the returning members
are key to the team's success. As
Freeman notes, “We didn’t lose
any at our better runners from
last year 7 the top five are back.”

The top iive include shavaun
Adams, Jennifer Bishop, Annette
Campbell, Susan Durkee, and An-
drea Straight.

Concerning new personnel,
Freeman commented, “I'm not
sure of the quality oi the new nin-
ners 7 having had only a iew
practices — but i expect they'll
add depth."

Depth is where the team’s
strength lies. according to
Freeman, and there should be a
“battle ior the top positions.“

with what she has seen,
Freeman has been impressed. She
remarked. “[The women] have
been challenging themselves and
working hard.” As a result, she
believes the team can do good
things this season.

“My main goal, and the one I've
expressed to the team, is to cap-
ture the Midwest Conference title
again. as we did lastyear," stated
Freeman. She added that the
team would also like to do better
than they did last year at the
NCAA Regionals,

Freeman expects overall that
the team “will do quite well this
year " They iace their iirst
challenge tomorrow against Coe
and Cornell The meet is here and
begins at 10 am.

gets more competitive also." He
added oi the ireshmen that.
“Nobody shines, but nobody sticks
out like a sore thumb either,”

The team lost four other men
irom last year's team. but Pfltsch
thinks they'll be somewhat easier
to replace than Donovan.

The basic stragegy that the
team will use this season is to
build a strong oiieiise to counter
the potentially weak defense,
Pfitsch is optimistic and said, “I
think we will continue to play a na-
tional game.”

Looking ahead, Pftiscli stated.
“In the on half oi the season.
Grinnell will be tough to beat." He
explainel that it Will probably
take halt the season to get the
team well organized

The team is larger than usual
due in part to the large number oi
ireshmen on the team, The

1467man squad includes 20 return-

ing players - l' of whom are let-

Men’s
Cross Country

Running seems to be a popular
undertaking these days Like the
\\ olnen's team, the Men's Cross
Country Team is a large one with
25 members.

Although last year's team was
oi a iairly good size. it was
”decimated by injuries." accon
ding to Coach Will Freeman, Con-
sequently, as Freeman notes.
"Our emphasis this year is on
staying healthy.”

As a result, the team has
adopted an entirely new approach
to training. According to
Freeman, this involves “less cm»
phasis on the earlier meets and a
heavy emphasis on ilexibility and
pool work."

This new training idea is based
on the goal of having the runners
reach their physical peak at the
conlerence meet. Freeman ex-
plained that the team will be
utilizing the meets as part or their
workouts 7 essentially as another
practice 7 all in training for coins
ference.

Besides his goals of keeping the
runners healthy and having them
reach their physical peak at con»
ierence, Freeman would also like
to “make it fun for them 7 to'va'ry'
the workouts."

So far. Freeman is pleased with
what he has seen. He stated. “The
team members are really pulling
ior each other; it's very positive
right now.” He continued, “When
they're running. they try to stay
together as a group. ,This kind'of
unity is really going to help in a
meet,"

The men's first meet is tomor-
row against Coe and Simpson. it
will be held here at 11 am, Star
ting out tomorrow with a healthy
and unified bunch of runners, the
Pioneers should iare pretty well.

last year's players returning. the
Women's Volleyball Team looks

perlence was in basketball, Mc-
Carthy has to years of experience

Field Hockey

A “fresh start” — probably the
best phrase to describe this year’s
Women's Field Hockey team.

relatively inexperienced team.

a lot oi people who’ve never

good skills apparent — particular
ly where stickrhandling is con-
cerned.

A mayor weakness this year is
the lack oi a goalie, “We're train

child said.

Despite the team's relative in-
experience, Fairchlld believes
that they “have the potential 7
we just have to instill agr
gressiveness in their minds.”

Aggressiveness is. according to
Fairchild, the key to higher scor-
ing. And, asideh‘om a strong
defense. high scoring'is a key to
winning.

In prevtewing the coming

goals she’d like to accomplish.
She remarked, “Overall, I want

tion ior this year's team,
