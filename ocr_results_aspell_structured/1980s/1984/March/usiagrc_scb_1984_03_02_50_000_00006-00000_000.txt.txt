Bonnie and Clyde

Arthur Penn's “Bonnie and Clyde" (1967) is basically a story oilove on
the run, with a twist: the lovers are the '30s legendary bank-robbing
team oi Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow.

The story begins with Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty). a reckless,
devil-may-Care youngster, meeting Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway)
while he is trying to steal her mother’s car. Bright and sensitive. Bonnie
is trustrated with her smalHown, hillbilly existence and tinds Clyde ex-
citing and glamorous. They run oii toegether and thus begins their
bloody journey through the Dust Bowl oi the Midwest. linally
culminating with their bloody death in Louisiana,

This trendrsetting iilm uses every kind oi cinematic trick in the book.
Plunging trom comedy to melodrama and social commentary. ”Bonnie
and Clyde” is vivid, stylish and technically brilliant, and ior many
reason, a very influential film which even made extreme violence
iasbionable. This nostalgic evocation oi sleepy midnmerica at the time
at the public enemies will be shown Friday (tonightl. March 2 at 9:30
p.m1 in ARH and Saturday. March 3 at 9:30 pm. in ARH. 111 min.

The Conformist

Anomer‘mﬂv‘ie set in the ’305, only this time in Italy and France, “The
Confurmist” (1971) is a virtual recreation oi an era and a political
regime: Mussolini's Italy. The iilm was both written and directed by
Bernardo Bertolucci, prodigy oi ltalian cinema.

The film’s protagonist, Marcello (Jeaanouls Trintignant), is a latent
homosexual who desperately seeks respectability and acceptance. He
joi the Italia Gestaop and takes a iie who is “all bed and kitchen”
ior tiresome mason: to conlormv. ._ ,y. ire »

sent to France to assassinate an anti-Fascist, ltalian exile who is a
iormer protessor oi his, Marcello. alter a meeting with the protessor and
an intense rendezvous with the professor’s stunning blond wiie (Dominie
que’Sandal. is unable to periorm the assassination, which is carried out
by others. when the Fascist regime collapses, disoriented Marcello
linally conironts his nature tor the iirst time and allows his suppressed
homosexuality to surface.

“The Conformist" is a lyrical iilm oi memory. structured and compos-
ed subjectively. moving easily back and torth in time with ilashbacks in-
terrupted by ilashiorwards and iantasies, This incisive exploration of
the irrenconcilable tension between the desire tor ireedom and the need
ior social acceptance is showing Friday ttoiiiglit), March 2 at 9:30 pm.
in SL and Sunday. March 4 2t9130 p.ln. ill SL. 115 mill.

Network

in “Network" (1976), screenwriter Paddy chayevsky ruthlessly ate
tacks good old American television — that menace which everyone loves
to hate but can‘t seem to live without. By blending realism with iarce
and reality with iantasy, Chayevsky makes an even larger comment on
our manipulated society.

Alter a long and rewarding career, anchorman Howard Beale (Peter
Finch) ls sacked because his ratings have slipped. The night atter
receiving the news, Beale announces on the air that he will commit
sui die on his final show. The next night, Beale returns supposedly to
apoligize, and and instead he launches into a lotirade, iull oi obscenities,
about television's inhumanity. His ratings soar. and Beale is catapulted
into a new career as ”the Mad Prophet oi the airwaves” and a nervous
breakdown.

“Network" is about televison running horrendously and hilariously
amok. Directed by Sidney Lumet, this iilm is nevertheless screenwriter
Chayevsky's movie. This outrageous, cruelly iuiiny, and searing indict-
ment of the boobrtube can be seen Saturday, March 3 at 10:00 print ill SL
and Sunday, March 4 at 7:15 )lJlL ill ARI-l. 120 mill.

La Dolce Vita

Another example of a talented Italian director's work, ”La Dolce
Vita” (1961), that next movie in the ongoing International Directors’
Series, 15 a merciless exposure of what director Federico Fellilli sees as
Rome's total decadence.

The iilm begins with a shot oi a helicopter ﬂying over Rome. Beneath
it on a cable. dangles a gilded statue of Christ. Is it “The Son of Man com-
ing in the clouds ol heaven .. the sign. of the end of the world" as seen in
Matthew? With this striking scene begins the seven nights ol destruction
and wrath preligured in the “Revelation at St. John the Devine."

in a series of vignettes. the lllm follows the hero, Marcello (Marcello
Mastroiannl), a reporter who stands {or Everyman, through the seven
nights or destruction and Successive stages of degredalion Then comes
the seventh and final night when Marcello abandons himself completely
to a savage and frenzied orgy which he linds dull and futile. Finally,
dawn brings the endless end of Fellini's wretched world.

“La Dolce Vita” is an attempted apocalypse, a vast evocation of the
Second Coming of Christ imbued with plenty of earthy realism, moral
depravity, and sexual excess which will show Wednesday. March 1 and
Thursday. March ii at 9:30 in SL.175 min.
