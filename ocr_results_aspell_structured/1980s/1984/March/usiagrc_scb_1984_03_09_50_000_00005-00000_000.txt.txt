Letters

Fox letter
‘racist’
To the Editor

Mr. Todd Harold Fox, I must
reply to your inflammatory arti-
cle submitted under the guise of a
different “view" of the Afrns
American Literature controversy.
I have never read such a racist ar»
ticle written by a peer. Yes, i have
chosen the Word “racist”. which
terrorizes many, but it is the only
word to describe such an un,
precedented atwck on the entire
minority population at Grinnell 7
and in America

First, may I ask you who
represents this “we". that you so
consistently refer to? 1 quote you.
”. .isn't it time we realize what the
idea is behind affirmative
action?". .“we should allow
minorities. . .". and “we should
choose a candidate. . .”. It seems
that the “we" you refer to is the
majority white population. Are
you taking such a paternalistic
and condescending view of
minorities — and if “they" cannot
do for themselves and that the
“we” must make “their” deci
sions ior them? To me, your word
chaise, “appease". evokes an im-
age of childslike blacks that must
be pacified, That, Mr. Fox, is
racism to me.

Second, you consistently make
assumptions and valuerjudgments
and present them as facts. ”It is
well known (and documented). ,
,that minority students, , are. .
.not as well-qualified to attend
those colleges as the attending
white students. . .it must be
remembered that this point does
not change the fact that minorities
are generally less-qualified". To
what documents do you reieri
From what recent source do you
paraphrase the idea that minority
students have not complied with
the requirements to attend Grin-
nell College or any other college?
And, quoting you again, . shall
we choose a candidate who is less
qualified (and black) [or the posir
tion. it becomes apparent that
you unjustly assume that Prof.
Kenneth Chambers is not
academically (or otherwise)
qualified for the position he now
holds; and you attempt to cast
doubts over the ”qualfications” of
past and future black protessors
at Grinnell. solely because they
are black, This also seems to be
racist to me. Your ”arguments"
could benefit from research and
support,. Mr. Fox,

Third, you are wrong, point
blank, in saying . .it is ludicrous
to assume that a person's skin coir
or. by itself, can have any effect
on ability to perceive the world
around him," Using your term,
the “polarization" of blacks and
whites is very much a reality in
American and indeed has a direct
iniluence on one’s everyday
perception oi the world 7 and
more importantly, how the world
perceives that person. A white
American child will never bear
the same scrutiny as does a black
American child in his ”ability” or
“qualification” for any endeavor
he so chooses to undertake; a
white will never continually read
about scientific attempts to “pro»
ve" his latent inferiority; a white
American, male in particular. will
never have to struggle incessantly
ior his equal rights as a human be-
ing. Mr. Fox. — Karen M. Tyler

I was extremely pleased to see
the large turnout at the S.G.A,

residential Debate Monday.

night, I was just as pleased to see
that there are six people running
for President this year. in con-
trast to last year's two can-
didates,

l was, however, very unhappy
to hear some of the gross
misstatements and blatant IﬂaC’
curacies uttered by some of the
candidates. it is distressing to see
individuals who have not bothered
to attend or speak out at any Joint
Board meetings unis year sudden-
ly claim to be in a position to
criticize all debate that has taken
place in Joint Board.

I was also disturbed to hear cers
tain candidates calling for S.G.A.
to offer usedrfurnlture sales and
used-book sales, S.G.A. has had
sales of this nature in each of my
four years here. Finally, it was
disappointing to see the same can
didates who called for the above
claim that the Administration had
given S G.A. additional funds in
order to pay for the student
security force. This statement is
quite simply ialse, It is no sin to be
ignorant. but it is inexcusable for
Presidential candidates to make
promises based on statement that
are blatantly in error,

i would urge all students to cast
their votes in favor of those can
didates who are wellsinformed
about the issues and know exactly
what it is they are promising. 7

President

Affirmative
Action _
re-exammed

To the Editor:

The United States Supreme
Court helps make a definite
distinction between affirmative
action and reverse discrimina-
tion. In the famous case of Peti-
tioner v. Allan Bakke, the court
allows that there are “constitu-
tionally permissible" goals in
which race can be considered as a
factor while choosing between in-
dividuals.

Specifically. the court finds that
academic institutions may look at
racein a positive manner to attain
diversity among their student
bodies, Schools may not, however,
exclude applicants of any race
from competing for the available
positions; a school may not
reserve positions which only
students of a certain race can fill.

Each student must reach a cer
tain baseline of academic ability.
after which race may be con»
sidered so mat a diverse student
body will result. Race can be look-
ed at in the same manner that
coming from a small town may
have helped me gain admission to
a school where the majority oi
students come from suburbs or
large cities.

This highly limited use or race,
called affirmative action, is very
different from reverse
discrimination, Reverse
discrimination seeks to rectify
past wrongs to a group of people
by discriminating against other
individuals today. The court finds
such solutions unconstitutional.
Yet even dieshard believers in
reverse discrimination would re-
ject Todd Harold Fox's definition
of “affirmation action”

Neither reverse discrimination
nor affirmation action argues that
”we should allow minorities into
positions ior which they are not
always qualiﬁed so that we might
appease that portion oi the
population."

There are many relevant con»
SCIOUS and unconscious effects of
being black in a society where
black literature is largely ignored '

power, But the college must not

legally inexpedient and morally

Politics
and the SGA

To the Editor:

A iew weeks ago, i wrote an ar-
ticle with Barry Edwards outlin-
ing uie reasons behind my support
oi George McGovern's presidenr
tial campaign. Now another
presidential race is under way.
one equally important for the
Grinnell student, although
perhaps not tor the rest oi the
country, Ispeak, of course, of the
SGA presidential race, which of-
iieially began Monday evening
with a debate in South Lounge. I
find myself doubly fortunate
because I have been meaning to
write about SGA political proV
posals ior some time, and as this
has become a major issue in the
race, 1 can now tackle both pro-
blems at once,

Every time i look at a summary
or joint board meetings, the issue
oi proposals to this or that
political group concerning this or
that bill always seems to
dominate. The only conclusion i
can make is that SGA feels that
one or is major tasks is to “repre
sent” the students by drafting
measures and proposals and
writing letters to congressmen
and'presidents.‘ The problem here
is not with the issues themselves,
as any policy oi uiis country et-
iects us very directly. Rather. I
question SGA‘s right tospeak for
the student body on these issues.

As any substantially controver-
sial issue arises in Washington,
there are always students taking
several different positions on this
issue. in respecting the rights oi
these dissenters, as the self-
proclaimed voice of the students,
the SGA must not draft such pros
posals or send such letters. We
are. as several of the candidates
pointed out on Monday, a
representative democracy. But
this does not give Hie SGA the
right to speak for all die students.
Not even the United States Senate
is so bold as to sign their bills “In
the name of all the citizens of the
United States.” There is only one
person that has die right to speak
the views or any student here at
Grinnell; that is the student
himseli, ii any person. SGA
member or not, wishes to express
his views in the form of a letter to
his congressman, let him sign his
name alone.

Of all the candidates for the
position oi SGA president. only
Todd Coulter understands and
agrees with this position, Todd is
not just the only candidate to
believe this way. but he considers
it the major issue in his platiorm,
All those present at the debate on
Monday heard him give the only
supportive response to a student
questioning SGA’S present policy.
As George McGovern stands
alone in calling for a reduction in
defense spending, so does Todd
stand alone on the issue of SGA
political letterrwriting. i am cer-
tainly not saying that the
presidential campaigns oi Coulter
and McGovern are alike, no. I feel
Todd has a good chance of winn-
ing. However. in another cams
palgn of “look alike" candidates, 1
have again iound one who is uni»
que, one I can support. 7 David

paigners have solicited or been

Routing the ruts

by Barry Edwards

where will you be next WednesV
day at 7:45 p:m.? Saturday at 5:30
pm? How about Monday at it)
a m.. I’ll be in Burling, at Quad
(nonsmoking section), and in the
Forum, respectively,

when i read the paper. i read
the comics first then the front
page. and finally, if I have time, I
read the OprEd page. One might
say that I have fallen into a rut.
Excitement. for me, usually in-
volves running out oi shampoo, or
something equally spectacularly
out oi the ordinary, And, I don’t
think that I'm the only person at
Grinnell whose life is a definite.
consistant pattern.

There are. usually, sound
reasons that these patterns
develop. Nonetheless. the reasons
oiten become secondary or corn
pletely forgotten, and the pattern
continues, Life becomes predic-
table, and people become bored
This is not a good state oi aiiairs,
and it is not conducive to a con
Structive. creative attitude.

Around high pressure times like
mid-sems, when people are
already irritable. the mundane
can become oppressive. it is
especially around these times.
although not exclusively. mat
avoiding usual patterns can add
zest to a day and make the usual
activities seem less tedious.

Especially when students have
an excessive amount of work. like
thirteen papers and two books in
one week, the irequently painstak-
ing and unenjoyable processes of
pounding and absorbing can
become more tolerable if the Over-
worked 7 enormously overwork-
ed 7 typical student takes some
time out of his day to do
something enjoyable. “Do

something enjoyable? >I’ve‘ got’lso ~

pages of Kierkegaard and three
papers due tomorrow!" All the
more reason.

Trying to work eiiiciently and
creatively while pursuing the
usual. uneventiul daily routine is
futile. Things can be accomplish-
ed. but more can be done ii a stu-
dent sits down to work — or stands
up to work. ii that's what you‘re
into — without the overwhelming
sense oi tedium. Dragging one’s
ieet into Burling and reluctantly

taking’root at a Carrel is not an at-
titude which is likely to inspire
brilliance. A refreshed and
possibly excited attitude about
working has a much greater
chance oi compelling Joe student
to compose a paper instead or
cranking it out.

Environment is important as
well. The same environment at
the same time every day simply
reminds people oi their usual
states of mind, Thinking about
walking to the studying spot
where one always labors. and then
alTivlng and wedglng one‘sselflm
to the appropriate corner is bound
to invoke thoughts of, “here we go
again , . "

Ritualistically removing a pen
from the backpack, bowing one's
head in Silence over the textbook.
and reading “today’s lesson" does
not entice the muses to tickle
one‘s cranium. Ascetic devotion
and priestly sobriety are not in
tellectual requirements

These same general theories ap»
ply to classes as well. Entering a
classroom. dreading every
minute is bound to make a class
something short oi enjoyable.
This rationality isn’t always the
first thing to enter someone’s
mind ataa.m,.admittedly.i3ut an
attempt to be conscious during
classes which are normally slept
through can make the classes
more bearable. Hell. sitting on a
different side of the room can at
least offer something new to look
at which might help enliven a
class.

Constant joviality and a
foolishly superiluous attitude isn’t
going to get papers written. Nor is
it entirely possible to be always
frolicking through A.R.H. turning
summersaults. The Academic

'Blues‘are bound to'catch up with" "‘

all of us. llowever, an occasional
attitude analysis is necessary. A
rejuvenation implanted into the
tedious daily schedule can provide
an attitude which is much less
down than we all tend to get at this
time ot year,

Defending Title IX

To the Editor:

Last Tuesday, the Supreme
Court issued a ruling on Title ix
which confirmed the worst fears
of women's rights groups. The
court, siding with the Reagan Ad
ministration’s brief, ruled that a
school will no longer be subject to
the revocation of federal funds if
they discriminate on the basis of
sex in any program not directly
receiving iederal iunds. Thus, on
ly those programs receiving such
funds are required to comply with
Title IX.

Title IX states that: “No person
in the US. shall, on the basis of
sex, be excluded irom participa-
tion in. be denied the benefits of.
or be subjected to discrimination
under any education program or
activity receiving Federal finan
cial assistance.”

The Court‘s ”program-specific"
interpretation of Title IX com-
pletely turns around the broad in
terpretatlon which the law has
received since it was passed in
1972.

This past interpretation held
that a School which received
iederal iunds in any one program
must comply with Title ix in all

ro rams. This interpretation

P
‘ {fr ed the basis on which schools

,e . required to remove‘
discriminatory practices in such -

areas as admissions, academic
programs, and amletlcs (Such
programs rarely receive direct
federal funds )

Since the implementation of Tie
tie IX (based on the broad inter»
pretationt educational institutions
have eliminated many
discriminatory practices against
women. This new interpretation
will essentially allow a school to
discriminate legally against
women in nearly all areas of
education. Such discrimination
could include sexual harassment.
against which women would have
no legal remedy.

The Reagan Administration has
iinally succeeded in scoring yet
another point against equal
rights, The same attack on Title
IX was attempted in 1981. when
Senator Orin Hatch (RrUlahl at-
tempted to amend Title IX in Con-
gress. Perceiving that the House
would never allow such an
outright step backwards in
women’s rights. the Reagan Ad
ministration went through the
Court and won. As a represen-
tative of PEER lProtection of
Equal Education Rights) said.
“The Reagan Administration
knows that there is more than one
way to skin a cat."‘ —‘i\iuy A, . ‘
