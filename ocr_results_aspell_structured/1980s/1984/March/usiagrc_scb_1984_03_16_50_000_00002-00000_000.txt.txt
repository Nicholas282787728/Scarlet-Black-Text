...and now for something

completely different

by Scott liiidula
After having been a student
here at Grinnell for almost three
years noh. l have noticed one
predominant trait among we
students that is rarely, if ever.
given any notice. We love to come
plain.
it doesn't matter ii the source oi
irritation is bad lettuce from
California, too much or too little
snow, or some human trait
displayed by a prof, A1] infra
ingemenls on our individual
universes are treated with a great
deal more enthusiasm than any
event that happens to make our
day run a little more smoothly.
l have heard the criticism that
we are all little snot nose private
college brats, but 1 won't go into
that as it's not my purpose to do
so.
Instead, I want to take a mo-
ment to acknowledge a iew oi the
people and things around here
that do make it a smoother exr
istence in our cacoon,

i. The telephone system.
Sophomores and Freshmen pro-

bably don't know what an absolute
pain in the hiney the old phone
system was. The bugs thatwere in'
the system last year were nothing
compared to what one had to deal
with my freshman year, In the old
days. it you were lucky enough to
get an outside line, that didn't
mean your parents would be able
to hear you above the static.

name) may be an obese, ugly old
gal with a pin head. but her in-
sides are made of gold, If I can bra
ing myself to spend Saturdays and
Sundays there, the place has got
to be D.k, (Not that you'll find me
studying - the library is now
more comfortable than my dorm
room. just turn me over if I'm
snoring.)

3. Cowles dining hall. Still under
the able and affectionate hand of
Betty Boop and Co, north campus
dining has become a swiit and
pleasant dining experience since
the addition of the conveyor belt
and the new seating arrangement.

now and then when I forget what a

Qualiﬁcations and

by Mark w. Schumann

Ever Since the search for a new
instructor in Afro-American
Literature became an issue, the
controversy around it has been
mostly emotional and dominated
by rhetoric and hyperbole thrown
about by all sides. It is time to stop
and think logically about the cons
troversy around the Afrnr
American Literature position.

This issue is really a combina-
tion of two. First, should the col
lege hire a black instructor? 5e.
cond, who is most qualified to take
the position? I will address both
questions in order,

College teaching positions do
not exist merely to be given as
prizes to those most “deserving."
They are Jobs, to be assigned to
the available candidates as the
employer sees fit to furdiei- the
employer’s own ends. Grinnell
College. the employer. is
obligated only to give each can
didate considera ' according to
his or her ab es and the
college's own interests as an
academic body.

A legitimate part of those in»
terests is the objective of having
more minority and women in
structors. what many people lose
sight of, however. is that the col
lege should be hiring these people
not as favors or compensation to
the formerly oppressed groups
from which they come, but in
Order to foster a more diverse
faculty and to provide role models
for women and minority Students.

This does not at all conflict with
the college's Affirmative Action
policy, which reads:

It is. ,the polity ofGrlnnell College to
employ. compensate. and promote per
sons on the basis of merit and fitness

There shall be no discrimination
because of ,race. . . The principal
commitment is to hiring those in-
dividuals deemed most likely to best
meet the needs of the college,

[A] need for [minority] representa
tion may . appropriately become a
contextual eonsuieratlon in determine
ing those individuals likely to meet the
needs of the college.

The needs of the college include
a need for an increase in its
minority teaching population.
they also include a need to treat
all applicants “on the basis of
merit and fitness.” whatever their
race,

Being black is an advantage
that may make an applicant more
qualified for the AfrorAmerican
Literature position, ior most
blacks have grown up with a great
deal of AfrOVAmerican culture of
,all types all around them. This is
perfectly in line with the needs of
the college, Hiring a black can»
dldate would help in addition to
bring about that racial diversity
for which the college strives. This
is also quite a legitimate need of
the college

Given this definition of
”qualifications.” it'is certainly
plausible that a white pr other
non-black applicant could
possibly be the best»qualiiied can-
didate available. This candidate
would be the one whose hiring
would be'most compatible with
"the needs of the college,” all
things considered. and thus the
one who would be accepted,

All these things considered.
however, there is really no reason
a nonrblack instructor must,
because of his race. be considered
less qualified than the other can»
dicates. While a black candidate

A. Food of Grinnell, 1 know
many or you (quite wrongly so)
will disagree with me. but i hapr
pen to be very pleased with the
quality and quantity oi food that is
served here. Perhaps you should
try cooking for yourself for a
semester and then come back.
Better yet. eat in a dining hall that
is served by SAGA. Not a pretty
sight. Three cheers as well for
Twyla (the check out lady) and
Gerri who definitely lift the lights

you deal with the slanders slung

sity backgrounds. they have
specialized in different areas. and
they have varying personal traits
and opinions. All of ‘these are
categorized under “qualfiica-
tions.”

Ability is most important in
selecting either students or facul-
ty, and ideally it should be the on-
ly iactor, but sometimes other
standards must be bent for any
one of many Special groups that
the college feels should be ens
couraged to attend or to teach.
This does not mean. however, that
a candidate’s lack of membership
in one of those groups should
eliminate him for consideration
regardless of the rest of his
qualificaitions, For this reason. it
is unprofitable for the college to
restrict its search for the Afror
American Literature professor to
blacks only.

 

A reporter writes

To the Editor-

As a reporter for this
newspaper, l have oitcn been
thankful for the restructuring of
some of my own sloppily written
copy; however, I have Just as
often been frustrated by careless
editing.

Three weeks ago, I wrote a
story covering a iaculty meeting
held on Monday. Feb. 20. 1984. In
my coverage of that meeting, I
quoted many members ol the
faculty and tried to do so with ac-
curacy.

As I recall. Coordinator of Sumr
mer Computing Programs with
Faculty Rank oi Assistant Flo
fessﬂr of Mathematics and
philosophy John David Stone
made a particularly eloquent
remark regarding the limitations
of quantitative data in determine
ing excellence in faculty. Accorr
ding to my notes he said. "i agree
with Ed [Barbnni] that nonquan-
titative data don't have to be
precise. Quantitative data are
iaster to deal with and you don‘t
have to be as sensitive to the
nuances of language "

This quotation seemed especial-
ly impressive ‘to me because it
came from someone who knows

the first five words, 1 included this
quotation in my article. In the pro
cess of editing. retyping. or prinr

replaced by the word ‘facts',

I was told two weeks ago Tues-
day. reb. 23, 1984. that the Editor-

him in my article, I asked the
Editorrlnrchief to print a correc-

obyection had nothing to do with
the error in print, Thus. i very
reluctantly write a letter to save
my own credibility in the iuture.

Please print this letter without
addition, subtraction. or correc»
tion; thank you, 7 Jane Kaufman

The word ‘faster' was indeed
replaced by ‘facts' in the printing
process and made its way into the
paper. This, however. was not the
alleged error that Mr, Stone ad
dressed. so I decided to print his
letter wiuiout a response

Time for

the draft

by Ben Johnston

Currently draft registration is
in vogue among our Pub and
Forum philosophers,

With the majority oi students on
campus being opposed to draft
registration, it is not hard for
these philosophers to perform
thElr intricate intellectual gyms
nastics to the iawning audiences
that eagerly accept any denuncia-
tion oi draft registration or the
draft itself.

li the issue oi registration for
therdraft gave these philosophers
the opportunity tqselfmighteously
denounce the whole idea of
military service while wearing
Army surplus clothes and sipping
beer in the comfort of the Pub, one
would think that the concept of
universal conscription would set
them to foaming at the mouth.
However. if done properly,
universal conscription is an idea
whose time has come.

First of all. universal conscripr
tion would have to include a few
basic tenets. Chief among those is
the idea that it would indeed be
universal. Everyone serves a
minimum of two years; whites.
blacks, hispanics. men. women
and homosexuals included. Even
the physically handicapped
should contribute. There should
be no deferments whatsoever.
especially not for college.

Consciencious objectors should
have the option oi serving in the
Peace Corps it they are qualitied.
or some other entity which could
be created to allow consciencious
objectors to do nonviolent work.
There should be no discrimination
on the basis of sex. Any woman
that wanted to and would be
physically capable of making it in
to a special unit should be allowed
to serve in that unit. That is.
women would not automatically
be excluded from combat. With
these qualiiications, universal
conscription would be fair.
equitable and beneiicial,

Universal conscription would
also contribute a large group oi
relatively well educated in-
telligent people into our military
population. This would not only
raise the average intelligence in
the military. it would also con
tribute a diiierent world view to
the one currently held in military
circles Soldiers like General
Omar Bradley. who did not go
through the Academy-Old Boy
systcni. bring with them a dita
ferent outlook on the world

Universal conscription would
also be more fair to the people
who enjoy the benefits of this
country less. but pay for it more,
In other words, it is about time
that rights. privileges, and
benefits that white middle and up-
per classes enjoy, stop being paid
for with the blood of poor
Southerners and blacks. The man
jorily of our military consists oi
blacks, hlspanics. and lower class
whites,

For all the benefits that the mid-
dle and upper classes enjoy in this
country. they have paid surpris-
ingly little, By increasing the
amount oi upper and middle class
whites in the military. universal
conscription would decrease the
probability of small wars. If the
wellroff living comfortably in this
country. knew that it would be
their sons and daughters who
would become ladder for snipers
and suicide attacks when foreign
policy fails. politicians mightbea
little more.careful about sending
in troops with no set goals.
