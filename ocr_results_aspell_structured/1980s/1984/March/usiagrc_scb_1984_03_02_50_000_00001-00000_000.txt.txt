Russian Revolutions
re-evaluated

by lrwan Makagiansar
“The fact that it (the Russian
Revolution) has survived, and
that it has some kind of popular
support seems to be in part ex
plained by the fact that this was a
regime which came into existance
through a popular revolution."
This statement was made in
regards to the Russian Revolution
of 1917 by Stephen Smith, a
visiting scholar from the Univer-
sity _of Essex, Colchester.
England, who was interviewed on
Wednesday by the Scarlet and
Black.

Also interviewed were Diane
Koenker, assistant professor of
history at the University or lllinois
and Daniel Orlovsky. associate
professor or history at Southern
Methodist University. All three
.long with Ronald Sony. prolessor
If modern Armenian history at
he University or Michigan are on
ampus to take part in the Sym-
rosium on the Russian Revolution
if 1917 that started Wednesday
nd will conclude in a panel
.iscussion today at 4:15 pm. in
outh Lounge. ,

It is a popular beliei oi the
merican public that the
o'lsheviks had seized power

police state. according to Dan
Kaiser. Chairman of Russian and
Eastern European studies. Such
belieis have subsequently in
fluenced the Us. policy-make
attitudes toward the' Sovle
government in the past and pre
sent. According to Kaiser, the
Symposium’s aim is to clariiy any
misperceptions about the 1917
Revolution in regards to the role
of the Bolsheviks in the formation
of the Russian state.

Smith pointed out that his lec-
ture entitled “Petrograd in 1917:
the View from Below" was aimed
at understanding the essential
role of the factory workers and
their needs for better social condi-
tion in Petrograd during mat
period. He noted that the
Bolsheviks were in fact supported
by the workers who had already
started organizing workers’ coma
mittees and whose interests were
most appreciated by the
Bolsheviks.

On a si ilar note, Koenker
asserted the importance of the
workers’ role in the revolution in
Moscow. The economic
breakdown under the Tsar’s
regime had caused workers irom
all sections to form various types
of committees. She said these
committees were initially ins

process is

dependent irom the Bolsheviks‘
iniluence, yet they realized that
the Bolsheviks were the most
representative socialist party in

'. ,Moscow,.an thus they supported

‘the Bolsheinks‘in the Revalutioh."

Orlovsky emphasized that the
existence of certain social groups
at institutions before and after the
1517 revolution. had aided the
Bolsheviks' maintenance of in-
iluence in the process oi me
Revolution. In addition. he men»
tioned that the Bolsheviks had in a
sense mobilized specialist of
diverse kinds such as
agronomists. staticians, and
teachers who were not skilled
workers but instead might be
termed “the proletarian in~
telligencia".

Orlovsky also stated mat there
has been a basic misunderstan-
ding oi the Bolsheviks' involve
ment in the Revolution, and that
such views have aiiected us
policy-making. He noted the
assumption that the USSR was a
totalitarian government which
had been imposed by usurpers
was a harmiul mispreception. He
further noted that as a whole, the
us. government has considered
the USSR to be an illegitimate
government.

nouncements. He stated that the

cent to make up ior the increased
tuition, and that the college will

sions policy. The “need blind"
policy means that the admissions
office will not take financial need
into account in making admit
tance decisions,

Hopkins noted that ”a continus
ing problem at Grinnell is minorir
ty recruitment, speciiically black
student recruitment." Hopkins

J.B. discusses
‘sound’ policies

By Melissa Kagle and Will Gar-
rison

Joint Board approved the pure
chase oia sound system for use at
student events at this
Wednesday's meeting. Other
issues discussed included the
availability of forum events to
townspeople and a suggestion that
each Educational Policy Commit
tee (EPC) providea substitute for
the abandoned end-ofcourse
faculty evaluations.

Treasurer Robbie Sckalor
presented a proposal to buy the
Forum's old sound system ior $750
over three years. The Forum
Fund will also contribute 3750
toward the purchase. The Forum
was eager to sell the system
because it was too large and
powerful [or their use. Sckalor
stressed that “everyone can use
it” and that Jenny Erikson will
train technicians to operate the
system at events, ior a iee. David
Kopelman, acting CSP chairman,
suggested the system be used at
Titular Head this year. This re-
quest was overwhelmingly denied
on the grounds that it might get
ruined.

Mary Kosmidis, Cleveland Hall
President, presented a resolution
suggesting that the “EPC in each
academic department adopt a

system oi evaluation oi the
courses in that department con»
sisting of written questionnaires
to be filled out in essay form."
Kosmidis felt this would be an ap-
propriate replacement for the
deiunct iaculty evaluations.

Pete Hautzinger, Vice Presi-
dent, opened discussion on the
question of whether or not
townspeople should have greater
access to events in North Lounge.
The general consensus was that
while town—gown relations should
always be improved, advertising
