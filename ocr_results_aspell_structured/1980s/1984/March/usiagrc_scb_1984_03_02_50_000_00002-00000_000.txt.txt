Amnesty International of Grinnell

by Andy Brown

in this age oi fast-breaking
technological revolution and sup-
posed improvement oi the human
living condition, progress has, unr
fortunately, not kept pace in the
realm of universal human rights.
Amnesty International (All was
formed in 1961 in an effort to avert
this dangerous trend, a major
aspect of which is the detainment
of prisoners of conscience. Since
its founding, Amnesty interna-
tional has dealt with over 20,000
such cases worldwide 7 cases in»
volving non-violent individuals
whose only crimes were their
religious or political convictions,
color, nationality, or ethnic origin.

Women and men all over the
world look to Amnesty lnternar
tional for support and solidarity in
their struggle for justice and sur»
vival. While A.I. is a worldwide
movement working for die release
of all prisoners of conscience, it
affords the opportunity for group
members to communicate with,
and thus aid conscientious in-
dividuals, in all pars of the world.

in matters oi gross violations oi
human rights, such as arbiﬂ‘ary
deprivation of human life, torture
and involuntary disappearances,
Amnesty International has de-
nounced these crimes against
humanity as being morally in-
tolerable and indefensible as a
matter of principle.

Last semester, Grinnell‘s
Amnesty group worked to secure
the support oi the campus come
munity in working for a “Univerr
sal Amnesty for All Prisoners of
Conscience”. An amnesty ior all
prisoners oi conscience would be
an unparalleled act in the building
of international confidence and
the promotion of fundamental
ireedoms. A petition ior those who
supported the appeal was cir»
culated by group members.

This semester Grinnell's
Amnesty international group he
tends to take a more active role in
the defense of fundamental
human rights. The group plans to
show the consciousness-raising
film, “Your Neighbor's Son, the

action against Paraguay‘s institu-
tionalizd brutality is planned, and
letterrwriting and publicity events
are especially important in order
to iocus attention on this country
where human rights violations are
particularly flagrant and
widespread.

function. Educational work is
planned for the high schools as
well as out-reach into the chur-
ches in an effort to increase public
awareness and activity. if the
community shows enthusiasm,
the group could then form an
adoption group which would work
for the release of individual
prisoners on a long-term basis.
The participation of townspeople
would be necessary to insure that
the adoption group be permanent
and thus effective at keeping in
touch With the prisoners that are
assigned to the group.

Amnesty international per-
forms an additional function: it is

The detailed reports put out by
Amnesty make for horrifying
reading: South Africa maintains
its racist System by intensified
repression, operating now
through the facade of a Ciskei, a
murderous nightmare set up as a
so»called independent state.
Murder is the technique of
political intimidation used by
right»wing governments in El
Salvador and Guatemala. Revolu-
tionary iran kills people simply
because they practice the Bahai
faith. in Turkey, the military has
imprisoned and tortured those
who favor democracy. The Soviet
Union has invented new “crimes"
and sped up the confiencement of
dissidents in psychiatric wards
and labor camps, lndonesia con-
tinues to brumlize East Timor. As
Amnesty’s literature makes
clear, Orwell’s vision of physical
cruelty as the instrument of
authority has become almost
commonplace,

The world must see a peaceiul
exchange of political and social
ideas. We need to tolerate the
religious and emnlc differences of
our fellow human being Yet in
more than 75 countries individuals
are imprisoned for peacefully ex-
pressing their beliefs or for just
being themselves —— as a member
of a particular racial or ethnic
group.

The world does not need people
to be tied down to a metal bed and
be subjected to electric shock on
their testicles. Individuals should
not have their heads held down in
a vat of human excrementt ln-
dividuals should not be drugged
into a vegetable state oi
aquiescence to their captors. Yet
in more than sixty countries
prisoners are routinely tortured in
these ways by their governments.

It is precisely these truths that
warrant our participation in the
protection of the integrity of the
body and spirit of humans
everywhere. Those willing to take
an active role in the defense of
fundamental human rights are en-
couraged to join the Grinnell
group of Amnesty International,

Uniforms no real problem

By Patrizia Westlield
On February 22, a resolution
was presented to Joint Board by
Ethan Cohen regarding the use of
student funds to pay for new food
service uniforms. The displeasure
over the use of these funds ap-
pears to be connected with the
iact that there might not be a plc~
nic at Relays this year. It seems,
according to some students, that
the answer for not having a picnic
last year was that the budget was
tight. This then connecw with the
dissatisfaction over the new
. uniforms, as students believe that
if the buddget is tight, then money

shouldn't have been spent on these
uniforms.

Responding to the resolution
(which failed), Dave McConnell
began by discussing the Relays.
According to him, Food Service
would be willing to sponsor a pic-
nic, should off-board students be
willing to give $1.50 each to
achieve a maximum of $175. Mc-
Connell stated that he had already
discussed this with off-campus
representatives. McConnell
believes that it is the off-campus
students who are most upset about
the absence of the picnic. While
this may be true, it is apparent

that there are many on-campus
students who remembered past
picnics and would like to see one
again this year,

As for the new uniforms, Mc-
Connell said, “Relays had nothing
to do with my decision to buy
uniforms." The reason for the new
hats and cover aprons, is because
of health and safety re
quirements, he said. However, the
uniforms do more than provide a
clean cover up, said McConnell.
According to him, they also pro-
tect the personal apparel of the
students and make student
workers identifiable to those pe0~

Amnesty sponsors lecture

By L. Harrison
“1 never knew what the next
day would bring” were the words
Jorge Jerias, a former “prisoner
of conscience,” used to describe
his experiences in a Chilean
prison. Jerias was the keynote
speaker in an Amnesty interna
tional (All program sponsored
by the Grinnell College Amnesty
international chapter,

Jerias, along with the president
of the Ames Amnesty Interna-
tional chapter, spoke to a group of
approximately 25 students in
South Lounge, Tuesday night.
Featured in the program was a 15
minute slide show on the role of
Amnesty, as well as Jerias’s talk
on his incarceration following a
1973 military coup in Chile. Both
Jerias and the president of the
Ames chapter stressed the
apolitical nature of A.i., stating
that its real goal was to use the
“power of moral persuasion" to
free prisoners who had been jailed
for their dissident political and
moral beliefs.

Tommy Rockland, leader of the
Grinnell College group, stated
that the Amnesty International
group of Grinnell was in fact a
“campus network” Consisting of
approximately 15-20 individuals.
A “campus network is solely
responsible for working towards
the release of prisoners vis-a~vis
letter writing, Unlike the “adop-
tion groups" (of Amnesty) which
are assigned specific “cases" to
work on, campus networks base
their work an “urgentjaction”
memorandums that are sent to
them by the larger body of
Amnesty.

Rockland commented that cam»

ters as “the college community is
a transient group,” and cannot
devote the time needed to free a
specific prisoner, due to an “ever
changing student body.”
Rockland estimated that although
the Grinnell chapter consisted [If
approximately two individuals,
over so people had registered to
participate.

Rockland’s point on letter
writing for campus networks was
echoed by the leader of the Ames
group, who urged the Students in
the audience to write governmen-
tal officials at both state and local
levels. He concluded the program
stating, “The letters you (the au»
dience) write, and the telephone
calls you make do indeed count,
You have this power as an in
dividual, and also as part of a col-
lectlve group.” ,

PsyChOlogist“ Elkins
in South Lounge

By Ellen Z. Piekalkiewic:

Nationally renowned counseling
psychologist Dr. Dov Elkins
speaking to a crowded South
Lounge Wednesday on the subject
of selfresteem said, “everyone
should receive at least four hugs a
day... in order to maintain good
psychological health.”

He explained that all of us need
affection because “So much gar-
bage is dumped on us.,.We need
positive affirmation," he added,
“whlch gives us a strong base in-
ternally.” Instead we have a
“stroke economy where people
parcel out affection," he said.

By receiving positive affirma-
tion, people build seli-esteem a
“people learn what they live,”
Elkins said. Once people build a
base of self-esteem (usually form-
ed by the age of seven), Elkins ex-
plained, they can begin to work on
a solid relationship with
themselves. “Being able to be by
oneself and have a pleasant time
alone" is extremely important, he
said, because “how can others
like you if you do not like
yourself." He said, “The relation
ship you have with you is the
primary relationship, and it afr
lects the way you relate to

ple who want s vice.

While the initial investment for
the uniforms was $1044, accor-
ding to McConnell, in terms of the
Food Service budget, it
represented only 39% of the
budget. It is true that with the
drop in enrollment the budget is
tighter, but McConnell pointed out
that to help those in need of finana
cial aid, Food Service has increas-
ed campus jobs by 7,000 hours in
the past few years, McConnell
then went on to say that present
supplies had become so low that
new uniforms were necessary.

Elkins said as one becomes
more selfesteemed one comes to
“trust the deepest nature of
oneself.,and trust life's ex-
periences.”

Once this level of selfesteem is
established he explained, per
sonal relationships will improve
as will one‘s’professional comr

phecy," he said,

Elkins urged his audience to
“believe that (they) are endowed
with gifts far beyond (their)
wildest dreams." He added, “It is
impossible to overestimate the
power of the mind set,”

Dr, Elkins is a man of many
titles including lecturer,
therapist, educator, and author.
He will remain on campus for a
few days, giving workshops to the
Student Advisors, the ad-
ministrative and student affairs
staff. ,

numerous articles and books, is

costing Food Service 3500 a year.
The new uniforms are expected to
last for the next three years so
that in the end they will have prov—
ed to be more economical, he said.

Cara Stein spoke to McConnell
this past week, representing the
oticampus students who are not
on board. She explained the situa-
tion by stating, “We‘re hoping to
make some sort of agreement
with McConnell so that we can
raise money to help subsidize the
picnic. He was really reasonable
and understanding and we hope to
