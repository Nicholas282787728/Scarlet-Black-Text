by Jane Kaufman

With 23 in iavor, >57 opposed
and one abstention, the
faculty voted down the Parslow
Proposal at Monday’s Faculty
meeting. Currently, die present
curriculum will stand.

Before the final vote, two
amendments were discussed: a
four-credit iine arts requirement
and a two-credit required physical
education class called “Wellness
Dynamics."

The fine arts requirement was
added to the final version of the
Parslow Proposal, which included
five additional amendments re-
quiring eight credits in each divi-
sion, three semesters of a foreign
language, lour credits in
designated problem solving and
freshment tutorial.

Courses fulﬁlling requirement
would be under the jurisdiction of
each division and the curriculum
Committee.

Social Studies Chair Jonathon

Andelson summarized the Social
Studies Division’s views toward
the amendment requiring eight
credits of social studies: “. . we
reached no agreement as to which
was our contribution... [to teach]
one major contemporary theory
[concerning] social and political
issues . . , or to teach students how
to analyze human behavior." He
stated that the “first . . . requires
more changes in the present our
riculum than the Second."
Finally Andelson said there is
“still opposition to a social studies
requirement [due to] the divided
nature [within the faculty], unfor-
seen difficulties [and] the
relatively small number of
students . . . without at least 12
credits within the division.”
Several members of the faculty
spoke regarding the implications
of the entire proposal, Wayne
Moyer, an Admissions Board
member, addressed core curr

Catholic Workers seek

end to homelessness

by Owen Charles

The Catholic Worker organiza
tion was founded in 1933 and since
then has been working [or

change as well as on behalf of the
needy and homeless of this coun
try. Speaking on Tuesday about
the Catholic Worker philosophy
and the homeless in Iowa were
Grinnell Senior Carmen 'l‘rotta,
Des Moines Catholic Worker Mike
Sprong, and attorney Donna
Henderson (also vvtth Catholic
Worker),

Trotta noted that the Catholic
Worker View of ”personalism”
demands that one become “in-
timate With the poor " He made
reference to the intimate relation-
ship with the poor that Jesus
Christ is said to have had.

Trotta noted that the Catholic
Worker organization sprang from
the Communist party newspaper.
the Daily Worker. in 1983. He add-
ed that a main point of difference
with the Catholic Worker was that
they espoused “Pcrsonalist
revolution” rather than violent
revolution.

Sprong spoke next. giving

Joint Board this week passed a
resolution that would mandate an
all-campus relercndum on any na
tional or international issue that
may come before it. The resolu»

referendum next Friday.

The relerendum will be held on
Friday, 4May, from 9am. to 4:30
p.m. in the campus post office.

Langan Hall President lan
McLean presented the original
resolution which would have re-
quired hall presidents and off-
campus representatives to poll
their constitutencies and to vote
according to the majority opinion.
That proposal was deieated last
week, mostly due to problems
with the method of representation
that it demanded. Rather than to

Sprong noted that the General Ac-
counting Office (GAO) estimated
the number oi homeless people
nationwide to be 2.3 million. He
contended that even this figure is
a conservative estimate,

Sprong criticized current
government policy regarding the
homeless, saying, “The idea is not
to count them. it is to open up the
doors and let them in.”

it was also pointed out by
Sprung that in Des Moines, there
is a 5 year waiting list for lows
income housing, He said. “The
government must provide more
low—income housing or more and
more families will be out on the
street."

Sprong also made reference to
the huge amounts or money in-
vested in nuclear bombs and other
tools of destruction by the US.

simply must be stopped. Funding.

to positive uses such as aid to the

McLean‘s revised proposal.
Constructed in consultation with
Dibble president Mickey Munley,
contained a new clause that would
bring its own approval to a
relerendum. The new proposal
also called for each hall president
to represent his dorm by reporting
the full totals of its vote, rather
than to cast one vote on behalf of
his entire electorate. These would
then be added by the Ad-
ministrative Assistant to arrive at

Addressing the same issue.
Director of College Evaluation
and Planning Ed Barboni stated.
“My own opinion is that there is a
risk [in adopting die proposal].
The magnitude of that risk we
don’t know.

Gene Wubbels, professor of
Chemistry, disagreed, “There are
quite a number of schools that
have open curriculum . . . It‘s pro-
bably worth it to takearisk and do
something different."

John Dawson, proiessor oi
Economics asserted, “It doesn‘t
seem to me that admissions is our

Liahna Babener, associate pro-
fessor of American Studies and

Her reasoning was that the cur-

Finally, Associate Professor of

"There aren’t that many

explained

Said McLean of his resolution in
its final amended form. “I really
think it’s ideal as far as a coin
promise goes. , . The way his now
is a compromise that satisiies
everyone."

The only “nay" vote in the roll
call was that of David Mathias of
Main Hall; Joel Dubiner of Loose
and David Lilienstein of Norris
were absent. Mathias said later
that he found the final cums
promise acceptable. but that all
the alternatives were not studied
before the vote.
