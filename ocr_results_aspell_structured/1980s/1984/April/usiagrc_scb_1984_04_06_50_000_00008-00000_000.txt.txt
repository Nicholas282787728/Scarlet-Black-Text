Mexico: A perspective on poverty
The trouble with loving Uncle Sam

By Andy Brown and Eric Green

Spending spring break in
southern Mexico was iar dilterent
irom visiting a standard vacation
spot like Daytona Beach in tact.
the inequality, poverty, and
hunger in parts oi Mexico make it
ditiicult to believe that the same
sun shines on both Florida and
Mexico. This article is an attempt
to explore our reactions to these
problems and hopeiully explain
why little attention is paid to the
plight oi the millions ot sutierirg
people in this world.

A vacation is of course a time to
relax and gather one’s thoughts,
to reevaluate anything and
everything happening in one‘s
lire. Mexico aflorded these oppor-
tunities but also ﬁlled our minds
with thoughts and images never
encountered in iowa. Our journey
also contained numerous
memorable experiences. like
riding the Mexico City subway
during rush—hour and sunbathing
on a beach patrolled by soldiers
with machine-guns.

Opposite the splendor of endless
beaches and mountain Vistas we
saw the thoughteprovoking and

complex images oi poverty and
hunger. We saw people just like
you and me who, ior no reason
other than chance of birth, live
their lives at the level of mere sub-
sistence.

In Puerto Escondido, a ﬁshing
village on the Paciiic coast about
150 miles north of Guatemala, one
sees the cruel effects of ins
digenous poverty contorted by
tourismt People who had been

whose eyes reilect their imbalanc-
ed diets, are forced by cir-
cumstances to peddle subser-
viently the products of their
iamilies’ labor to overfed tourists.

It is a shameful irony that we. ll'l
realization oi our bourgeoise
values — of which leisure time is
perhaps the most symbolic
vestige 7 should choose to spend
our vacation in an artiiicaliy
created paradise amidst people
floundering on the edge of ai-
istencei

Marx believed that only the
leisure class possessed a con-
ciousness, {or those who were
forced to work could only be con-
cerned with matters. of . sub-

more knowledgable about soil, ior
example, than a student oi
history. Yet it was difficult for us
to see how the masses oi displaced
peasants working as vendors
could in any way afford thoughts
outside oi the immediate context
oi their depraved existence,

But perhaps the most tragic
irony oi all is that the Mexicans.
whose livelihood consists oi catere
ing to tourists'; “needs," tend to
admire rather than resent their
victimizers. They sport [shirts
from American Universities and
guzzle large quantities oi Pepsi,
thus displaying their lust oi the
American lilestyle.

It is not difficult to understand
how the impoverished of the
underdeveloped world come to
lust alter the American lifestyle
After all, Americans need not
worry about where their next
meal is coming lrom, At the same
time, however, the implcations of
this kind of attitude towards
America are iar reaching: it
tends. in our observations, to
perpetuate the existing stratifica-
tion and it inhibits awareness
about the true community in
terests. The problem is essentially
one of identification, for con-
sciousness oi the common in-
terests of one’s community and
awareness of how these interests
may clash with the interests of
others is a necessary precondition
tor revolutionary change.

Yet we iound a great number at
individuals with no hope oi salvae
tion ior their community, but
rather the wish to emigrate to the
United states it is individual up
ward mobility, as opposed to the
uplilting oi the community at
large, which stilles any hope or
iundamental social change.

The owners and managers oi
the hotels, restaurants, and other
establishments which cater to
tourists iorm a distinct class, and
its members are admired and
respected throughout the town.
While members oi this class are
especially prone to indentiiication

with the United States and its
socioeconomic system (since it
is, in fact. the Source of their
wealth), the remaining population
stands in awe of this localized Ver-
sion of the ruling class, Thus, by
creating a clique ot native en-
trepreneurs as well as by tlaun-
ting their own bourgeoise values.
one sees how the presence of
Europeans and North Americans
has enhanced the inequality in
social relations among town
members.

To compound the irony we sit on
the beach and read. absorbing
knowledge and iormulating gran
diose opinions about ourselves
and the world around us. Thme
thoughts are intangible
manifestations of the leisure time
inherent in our bourgeoise
culture,

counters with the question oi how
the developed world, with full
knowledge oi world poverty and
hunger, does not act to eradicate
the problem. We concluded that it
is fundamentally a problem with
the relationship between empathy
and political action.

As individuals, we feel sicken»
ed, saddened and occasionally
responsible for the inequalities we
observe. Unfortunately. these
emotions are too rarely
transformed into action and the
nature of the problem demands
action so‘extensive that only large
governments have the power to
carry it out,

Why. then, do governments cola
lectively fail to allocate resources
to fulfill basic human needs?

Theories abound regarding this
neglect, some observers. like

'1 is fundamentally a problem

with the relationship between

empathy and political action.”

‘ Perhaps all our free time is a
blessing, a chance to create
something positive ior
humankind. But have we ac-
complished anything with our
books and spaceships when half of
our overpopulated planet suffers
from malnutrition? These
abstract concepts of bourgeoise
guilt are diiiicult to come to grips
with on a personal level,

In Mexico one cannot avoid an

monetary values and consequent-
ly nonouantiiiable human needs
are ignored.

Other commentators, like
Robert Johansen. believe the
flawed nation-state structure is
responsible ior the vast inequality
between North and South The
nation-state is geared to compete
against its neighbors and thus
misallocates resources and
calculates according to the “nae
tional interest” rather than the
human interest.

Both of these models illustrate
the chasm between human needs
and government action designed
to meet these needs. We urgently
need to make our institutions ex-
press the empathy we teel ine
dividually, The Southern
hemisphere is full of evidence of
our failures in this regard;
evidence guaranteed to evoke
strong emotions in all visitors
there. Feeling empathy is not
enough: we must translate in-
dividual emotions into collective
action before it is too late,
