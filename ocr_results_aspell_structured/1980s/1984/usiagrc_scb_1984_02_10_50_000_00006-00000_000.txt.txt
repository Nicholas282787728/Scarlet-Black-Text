TheuKlezmorim; dzdny
evening of musrcal fun

Grinnell will get a taste of the
wacky, jazzy, bluesy, and slightly
loony world of Klezmer music
when the widely acclaimed group
HThe Klezmorim” comes N town
Saturday night, 11:45 p.m., for a
concert in Herrick Chapel, The
group will appear under the
auspices of Jewish Cultural
Weekend and should provide a
highlight for this weekend’s ac-
tivities.

The six-member ensemble,
founded in Berkeley, Calif, in 1976
by clarinetist Lev Liberman, puts
on a performance that is a “zany
mix of musichall comedy, circus
and cartoon music, and sur-
realistic images from ‘The Late
Late Show’ all served up in a good-
time party atmosphere which
evokes the verve and spontaneity
of an after»hours jam—session.’1
Or, to be more specific, The Klez-
morim is a group that defies
categorization, their genius
resting in their ability to combine
the virtuosity of a classical
chamber ensemble with the
energetic, rocking rhythm of a
New Orleans jazz band. Their uni~
que brand of antic-laden esoteric

performance has been described
as “loonyrtunes cabaret‘ jazz,"
and their music has been aptly
characterized as “the vodka-
soaked sound of a steam calliope
gone mad.”

Comprised oi a clarinet, sax
ophone, trumpet, trombone, tuba,
and percussionist, The Klez-
morim have made over 25 North
American tours with appearances
at hundreds of major concert
halls, college. universities,
festivals and clubs, They have
made radio appearances with the
Canadian Broadcasting Company
and on Garrison Keillor's N.P.R.
hit “A Prairie Home Companion."
In addition, they have done work
on movie soundtracks, including,
among others, Neil Diamond's
“The Jazz Singer.” The KlezV
morim’s third album was
nominated for a Grammy in 1981“
and in February of last year the
group twice sold-out Carnegie
Hall.

Herrick may not be Carnegie,
but The Klezmorim will always be
The Klezmorim. Check these guys
out. . .oy gut!

’ Fol/e dancers to
whirl in Herrick

by Pete Lydeeker

Everyone will have a chance to
improve his or her cultural
awareness this coming weekend
when the Grinnell College Folk
Dancers present their Nineteenth
Annual Spring Concert in Roberts
Theatre. The concert skirts at 7
p.m. on both Friday and Saturday
nighs and will run a little over an
hour, including intermission. The
Marimba Ensemble will be the
featured performers during inter-
mission.

This year‘s concert will run
shorter than concerm in previous
years, due to a smaller group this
year. In the last two years, eigh-
teen members have lett the group
because of graduation or have
transferred to other schools. In
addition, few students have joined
the group within the past two
years. In order to attract new
members, the Folk Dancers will

,‘ be having a Beginner’s Night on

March 3 in North Lounge. All are
invited to attend.

Directed by Linda Folkers and
choreographed by the dancer;
the concert consists of seven na-
tionalities of dance: Hungarian,
Armenian, Macedonian, Israeli,
Bulgarian, Austrian, and Roma-
nian. In addition, several guest
dancers are featured in a couples
dance with some of the students.
Guests dancers include Grillnell
professors Kamy Kamp, Helen
Scott, and .lim Swartz, among
others,

For the Folk Dancers, who per
form for various local organiza-
tions throughout the year in addi-
tion to performances at the col-
lege, this is their big production of
the year. Preparations for the
concert began last semester, con-
tinued through Winter break, and
culminated with three to four
rehearsals each day for the past

threeweeks.‘ ' ,

‘Siberiade’:
from \Russia with love

by L,M. Winters

During Slavic Weekend
(February tozoi, the Grinnell
College campus is presented with
the rare opportunity to 'see
“Siberiade,” an extraordinary
Soviet epic which won not only a
Special Jury Prize at the 1979 Can
nes International Film Festival
but also the 1982 Exceptional Film
Award from the National Board of
Review. In addition to
“Siberiade” and the American
film “Reds,” many other ac-
tivities are planned for the
weekend including a lecture about
bells in Russian history, a Slavic
coffeehouse, and a concert by me
St. Olaf College Russian Choir.

Originally released as a pair of
films running a total of 4% hours,
“Siberiade” was trimmed to ap-
proximately three hours for
American audiences, During the
course of Slavic Weekend, the film
will be shown first in two parts on
two different nights and then in its
entirety on the same night. The
first part will be shown on Thurs-
day, Feb. 16, at 9:30 pm. in South
Lounge: the second part on Sun-
day, Feb. 19. at 911m, in the South
Lounge; and both parts together
on Monday, Feb, 20, at 7 pm. in
ARI-1 Auditorium.

“Siberiade” is directed and co-
written by Andrei Mikhalkov-
Konchalcvsky, director of ”Uncle
Vanya” and “Nest of Gentry."
Konchalovsky is me brother of
Nikita Mikhalkov who is already
Well-known to Soviet and
American audiences through such
hit films as “A Slave of Love” and
“0blom0v.” In “Siberiade,”
Nikita foregoes his usual direc-
torial duties in order to play
oilman Alexei Ustyuzhanin, one of
the film's most compelling
characters

The tilm is an epic saga of sixty
years in the lives of two families
in Elam, a small town in Siberia.
The Ustyuzhanins are shepherds
and loresters 7 working people
who are constantly on the brink of
economic ruin. Living just across
the compound are the Solomins,
who are gentry-middlemen who
buy and sell livestock. The poor
Ustyuzhanins would welcome a
change; however, the Solomins
desperately fight to preserve their
present position which means no
interaction and certainly no inter-
marriage with the Ustyuzhanins.

Spanning from 1909 through the
1960's, the film follows the nap,
rative of the two families through
marriages, feuds, love affairs,
murder, and revenge against the
dramatic historical events of
modern Russia from the 1917
Revolution through the Civil War,
the late 1930's, World War II, and
finally the sixties, when oil is
discovered near Elam. The intert-
wining of the national situation
and its effects on the local situa-
tion is accomplished by intersperr
sing the personal narrative with
montages or old newsreel footage
and clips from early Soviet films.

Enormously popular in its own
country, “Siberiade” proceeded
to take Europe by storm and daz-
zle critics and audiences alike
Although winning a prize at the
1979 Cannes International Film
Festival. the film did not make its
American premiere until
September of ’82. Even then, its
delayed and limited release was
not well publicized, resulting in
few people having the opportunity
to see the film. However. the Grin~
nell community has the chance to
be swept away by the movmg perr
tormances and the breathtaking
photography of this unforgettable
masterpiece of Russia. her
history. and her people. .

Film, film, film...

FIDDLER ON THE ROOF

As part of Jewish Cultural Weekend, “Fiddler on The Roof” (1971) is
the panoramic story of Tevye (Topol) and his family as they struggel to
regain their identity in the face of increasing political unrest in pre
revolutionary Russia.

The charm of “Fiddler on The Roof" rests in the intimacy of the rela-
tionship we forge with the genial Tevye as he comments on life in the
Russian shtetl of Anatevka. As a result of mis relaitonship, we arc more
apt to emphathizc with Tevye as we weighs his mixed response to the
marriages of his three daughters, as he ponders his preedicament as fine
of the many poor, down—but-not-out Jews living in a ghetto among hostiel
Russians, and as he questions the falrnus of the lot given him in life by
his good buddy, God._

Topol, though not as genial and not quite as endearing as Zero Mostel
(who played Tevye in the Boradway musical), nonetheless comes
through with a winning performance as the bearrlike milkman of
Anatevka. His wife (Norma Crane) and his five daughters compliment
each other well, and the ensemble scenes are done with vigor and
energy. The supporting cast is huge and deckedout in elaborate
costumes, and is seen with regularity in the frequent production
numbers,

“Fiddler On The Roof” is a warm, earthy look at simple Jewist folks
who have a penchant tor bursting into song and dance when the mood
hits them right. It’s a nice changeotrpace film that will show Friday,
Feb. Ill ttonighti at 9:30 pm. in ARH, and Sunday. Feb. 12at 8:00 pm. in
SL. 150 min.

TAXI DRIVER

Executing an abrupt aboutsface from the genre of “Fiddler On The
Roof" brings us to “Taxi Driver” (1976), the grim saga of cabbie Travis
Bickle (Rober DeNiro) and the acute alientation that drives him to
murder in an attempt to define who he is by means of an apocalyptic
catharsis,

Critics have likened the hapless Bickle to a contemporary
‘underground man,‘ ala Dostoevsky. In Dostoevsky’s "Notes From
Underground,” the underground man wallowed about in his own
sickness and his own spite. “I am a sick man... 1 am an angry man. I am
an unattractive man. i think there is something wrong with my liver,"
wrote Dostoevsky’s antirhero. Travis writes in his diary, “The smell of
flowers made me sick, I think I got stomach cancer."

In the spirit of Dostoevski, Travis is also embued wim an ideal of beau-
ty and goodness. In this ideal he finds two women who are polar op-
posites: Betsy (Cybil Shepard at her best), the creature of society who
seems to float above the murk and slime of the city, and Iris, the twelve
year-old prostitute (Jodi Foster) who is a victim of the ugly side of the cir
ty. Travis, hopelessly confused, tries to win Betsy with slime by taking
her to a porno-movie and tries to save the tainted Iris with Virtue when
he tries to persuade her to return home to her parents. predictably he
fails on both counts, and the tension within him makes a quantum leap
when he fails to connect with either the society belle or the child pro-
stitute. ‘

The settling for Scorsese’s tense drama are the mean streets of New
York City, garish neon-lit boulevards populated by the jackals and care
rion of the city’s underworlds. Pimps and weirdos and hookers and
pushers are all part of the world that Travis occupies, a contemporary
hell that exits on the fear, frustration, despair, and alienation of human»
beings living on the finest of edges.

Scorsese's version of modern-day hell and the awful results that
alienation have on a struggling cabbie will be shown Saturday, Feb. 11 at
11:00 pm. in ARH and Sunday Feb. 12 at 7:00 in ARH.114 min,

THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST. MATTHEW

For goers of more esoteric film, Pier Paolo Pasolini's ”The Gospel Ac-
cording to St. Matmew“ (1964) is a must-see. A realistic portrayal ot the
life and words of Christ, Pasolini’s film has been acclaimed for come
municating a profound spirituality and has been debated for its pore
trayal of an activist Christ.

In true nee-realist fashion, Pasolini transposed the narrative to the
narrow streets and burren hillsides oi southern Italy, and populated his
biblical landscape with the faces of local peasants and non-professional
actors. The film creates a style that is, like its central figure, full of
violent contradiction. Paslini has created a Christ more nobel and
touching than a Marxist messiah, and more authentic than the
customary Hollywood Christ.

' This film that TIME magazine described as “direct, provacau've, and
eloquent" will be shown Monday, Feb, 13 at 7 :30 in SL and Tuesday, Feb.
14 at 7:30 in the AR“ audio-video room, 135 min

GANDHI

It took Sir Richard Attenborough twenty years to finally get his film on
Mohandas Gandi on the Screen, but the final product was well worth the
wait. Starring Ben Kingsley in the role of the mahatma, “Gandhi” (1932)
went on to win eight oscars, glowing critical acclaim, and, tor Kingsley,
praise for his protrayal of Gandhi; in the words of one critic, “possibly
the most astonishing biographical performance in screen history."

“Gandhi" is this semester’s fourth offering in the ongoing Interana-
tional Director‘s Series, and tells the story of how the young barrister in
South Africa], Mahandas K. Gandhi, eventually becomes the symbol of
not only India’s but the entire worldwide movement of nonviolent
resistance. The idealistic young Gandhi, with his clipped British accent
and his starched white collars, is contrasted t the later Gandhi, clad in a
dhoti and often receiving visitors as he sits working at a spinning wheel.

The gist of the film concerns India's fight for independence from the
British during the early decades of this century, an the inportant (how’s
that {or understatement) role that Gandhi played in ﬁle eventual success
of this movement in 1948. The film deals with the Hindu vs, Muslim con-
flict Very well, and presents with tragic irony the events that lead to Gan-
dhi’s assassination by a Muslin extremeist in the year of India’s newly-
gained independence.

The life of one of this century‘s or for that matter any century‘s
greatest men makes for a compelling film, not only for its artistic and
professional merits but for the story of the man it is about. Gandhi had a
vision that all peole could learn from, and that vision is admirably
represented and told With great sensitivity in the film. It you see any
movie this year. by all means see “Gandhi.”
