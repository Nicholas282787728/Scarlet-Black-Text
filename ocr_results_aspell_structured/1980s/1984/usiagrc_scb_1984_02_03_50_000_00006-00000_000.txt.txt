Weekend trio of ‘
riveting ﬁlm

by Scoll Sulherlnnd

Two films dealing with the theme of
psychological transformation kick—off
the cinematic offerings this weekend.

Both lngmar Bergman's “Persona"
and Peter Brook’s “Lord of the Flies”
concern themselves with the complex
workings of the human mind. and the
consequences that arise when those
workings go askew. Not to lead us to
depths of depression over the tenuous
state of our grey-matter. the films
committee was kind enough to
schedule a nonrpsychological,
thoroughly entertaining film to round
out this weekend’s fare. “Tender Mer-
cies." starring liobert Duvall. has been
hailed by some critics as the best ﬁlm
of 1983 and is not to be missed

‘Persona’

“Persona" (1966, b&w). starring Liv
unman. Bibi Andersson. and Giuinar
aiornstrand, is a complex film that
deals with the even more complex pro
cess of psychological disintegration.
Bergman uses a ﬁlm~withinthe~filni
to tell the story of an actress (Liv
Ullman) who has abandoned the power
of speech and is put in the care of a
nurse (Bibi Andersson). Gradually, the
nurse experiences an increasing need
to Vent her own emotional angst that
ends with a nervous breakdown. The
two women do not swap identities;
rather. it is their roles that are jux-
taposed and finauy reversed as the
nurse loses her grip on reality.

"Persona" gleans considerable
power from the understated, in a
memorable scene. Bibi Andersson tells
of a day and night of sex that she er
perienced one summer in her past.
Bergman never actuauy shows us
Andersson with the boys on the beach;
rather, Andersson merely tells her
mesmerizing story. relating the
nakedness and the freedom that she
felt. and does so with such subtle yet
captivating force that one critic has
heralded the scene as “one of the most
erotic on film "

“Persons” is typically Bergman in
its use of venerable cinematic themes
an the multiple levels of interpretation
that those themes invite. Though “Peta
sons" is thematically dense it Is not
altogether impenetrable, it is an m-
tricate, subtle film that holds rewards
for those who like a challenge. Show.

‘Lord of the
Flies’

The second pyschological study
treated on the silver screen this
weekend is “Lord of the Flies" (1963.
b&w), written and directed by Peter
Brooks. Based on the novel by William
Golding. the lilrn deals wtth the
degeneration into savagery by a group

of British school-boys.who become.

stranded on a remote island fouowing
a plane crash. The film version of
Golding/s powerful story does the
hook justice. as the school-boys por-
tray with frightening abandon the
tendency of human nature to revert to
the primal savagery of animals. given
the right conditions. showing Friday,
