Lest wc get too excited about

A similar phenomena occurred
Just alter the turn 01 the century
with the logical positivist niove~

liis point is that in order tor
science to progress. there must
not be strict rules guiding tlicory

construction and the like. but that

all input must be considered This
does not meaii tlial matters at

etc. are to be abandoned. but that
these evaluative measures should
be brought to bea- only alter
thoughtful consider' ion ol all at
the presented alternatives

The same can be said of the tour
things I mentioned at the opening
or this letter. As Ellen Weinstock
put so well. instead oi pointlessly
criticizmg the editorial policies oi
the s and is why not write
something retlecting your own
biases and I'll bet it gets put in.

Further. it we accept that cite
cessive criterial demands stillc

theil the obvious rise in academic
pressure can be seen as counter-
productive-.1" a similar vein. it Is
indisputable that entering
students need time to adapt to the
advanced academic environment
here. not to mention the un-
laniillar social habitat. Accor-
dingly. the ioriiial grading ot’ the
ti'eshpersoii tutorials is 0 'er-
burdeniiig as well as antithetical
to the successlul integration ot
young creative minds into the
learning environment at tn iiiiiell
