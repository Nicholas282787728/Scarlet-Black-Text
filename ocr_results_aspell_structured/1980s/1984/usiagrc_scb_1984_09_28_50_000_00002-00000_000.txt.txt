Vandals Destroy Griffin At Bank

by Leisu Cherie Kiicttle

The crime \ias the destruction
at one priceless gold guilded grit
fin decorating the entrance to the
Poweshiek County National Bank.
also known as “The Jewel Box”.

The charge is criminal
mischief, a class c telony
punishable up to 10 years im»
prisonment.

Detective Doug Shutts of the
Grinnell Police Department
stated that they received a call
Wednesday, Sept, 19, at midnight
about the vandalism which ap~
parently took place between 11
pm and 11:30 pm,

According to police, there was a
large group present at the time of
the incident.

However. those individuals who
were brought in for questioning
claimed that they were around the
corner when the gritiin was
broken.

Detective Shutts says. “No one
has the intestinal fortitude to
testify." Although he expects that
with a reward fund of about $500,

someone will eventually stand up
and testity.

Doug Hill, Executive Vice
President of the Poweshiek Counr
ty Bank. believes that the mortar
which held the griilin in place had
loosened over the years, so that
the vandal only needed to give me
several hundred pound statue a
concerted shove in order to topple
it over. The gritlin is now sitting in
the bank in two large pieces and a
dozen chips, it took three men to
carry it into the bank.

Two possibilities are being con-
sidered at the moment concerning
the restoration of the griffin, ac-
cording to Hill, The preterred ope
tion is to find a professional in
terra cotta restoration who can
put the pieces back together
again. The alternative is to bring
the remaining griitin into the
bank and replace the originals
with replicas. Mr. Hill remarked
that both consideralons are ex-
tremely costly.

Food Music a la Cowles

By Karla Erickson

“More Casserole, please!" That
is what many students are saying
to the recently tormed pep band
called More Casserole.

“This year the band has gotten
bigger and better. but we don't
want to lose the element of
silliness and spontaneity,” re-
marked Tim Black. an original
member of the band which was
formed in February.

Byron Ricks, another original
member. explained how More
Casserole began, ”We (Ricks and
Black) were in Cowles Cafeteria
when the famed More
Casserole. Like that, our band
could be the synthesis of many
'riffs. overtones. harmonics, and
other jazz jargon; to lorm one Lass
ty musical experience And then,
there was the More Casserole
band."

Black. being more modest. said.
"Well. we thought oi it one night
at Cowles."

All the members look on names
of loads, Presently. there are nine
members. according to Ricks,
They are: Shepard's Pie tbyron
Rckst. Party Potatoes (Tim
Black). Veggie Kabob (John Nora
ton). Plaza Ill Soup (Todd McIn-
tirel, Refried Beans lDan
Williams). Chocolate Mousse
iMaren Van Nostrand). Honey
Marinated Chicken Quarters
tEi-ic Nelsoni. Toiu Stirfry (Rich
Percyt. and Meat Fried Egg
Sandwich i Mark Gerth) They are
expecting additions to the band
soon. Ricks commented.

Moi-c Casserole performed at
the tootball game on Saturday.

they pertornied to songs such as
"The stripper "Working in 3
Coal Mine". “ at Blues". and
"L uie.Lou1e."

”i thought they were tremen~
dous! it added a lot to the game."
commented Rob Rollins.

Jenny Heini added, .

were fantastic. i'm stripping with
them next time when they play the
stripping song! "

As a result at pertorming in The

to Ricks. the band won the
”judges’ award". Parade judges

the winner was More Casserole,
The band competed against a
bagpipe band. said Ricks. They
received a gift certificate to the
Music Shop for $8.58 as their prize,
Ricks added that they planned to
use the certiticatc to buy
drumsticks.

More Casserole will be playing
at various football and basketball
games. Ricks said. He also added
that their "Honor G" formation

the “Honor G”, members ot the
band torm a G with their bodies

Black pointed out. “The bottom
line is that it is silly. crazy. and a

Adminstrators But
Not Students

by liebccca Weston

As in lots at areas oi the college,
the influence of the liberal 1960's
and 70's is tading trom the
freshman tutorial program. Gone
are the days of a no credit/credit
distinction ‘transition' class.

Twelve years ago the treshmen
tutorial came into being for
several reasons. The, primary face
tor was that the Seminar served as
a tool tor students to get in-
tegrated “into the academic
demands of Grinnell." said
Catherine Frazer, Dean of Facul-
ty, Furthermore, the class gave
advisors the opportunity to see
their students in class A improve
ing on the advisory system

Secondary lo the above. was
that the school was [allowing the
national trend of experimenting
with and altering traditional
educational norms For that
reason, the credit/no credit
system was adopted.

But it is now the l980's, and
again. the program has changed,
Last year. the college instituted
the grading system without much
protest. "0n the whole. everybody
has been pleased \vlth it 7 both
the Students who take it and the
faculty members who teach it."
according to Frazer.

There were many reasons why
the administration dectdcd to let
ler grade the tutorial. One reason
was that the credit/no Credit
system virtually evolved into the
more traditional modes of
grading. Students strove [or
distinction as they did for an ‘A'.
and many teachers assigned them
in that manner, according to

Moreover. the prekus grading
system sent mixed messages,
Neither students nor taculty knew
how much emphasis was to be
placed on the tutorial. Because it
was not worth a grade. many did
not know whether it was the least
or the most important class,

"I don't think it'll change the at-
mosphere or the course. while it
will more accurately determine
the grade average of the students
7 quite frequently to their
benefit.” Frazer said. She con
tinued to say that the credit/no
credit system benehtcd the
weaker students more than It did
the better ones.

it is ditiicult to assess the ad
vantages of the new program
because “it is a swaying of a pen
dulum. , who responds well
depends on one's individual
philosophy." However. it doesn't
seem to have gotten very
tavorable results

Hadj Amjadl. a tresliman,
would have prelerred the
credit/no credit system. He said.
“The whole idea behind the
tutorial was that it counted as tour
credits without a grade. so we
could have a lighter class load
first semester. That has been
negated by this whole grading
deal."

Renovations were started at
K DIC last May to redesign the sta-
tion's floor plan and to install a
new 100»Watt stereo transmitter,
Until last summer. KDIC had
been using a iarwatt mono
transmitter that had been pur
chased second-hand when the star
tion first went on the air in the ear
ly seventies.

De Young described the new
transmitter as being of a ”State of

e the art” quality, According to De

Young. ”the transmitter setrup Ins
cludes equipment that will make
the sound quality of the signal
comparable to that oi KUNL
which is one to the best public 5m»
tions in the Midwest." There will
still be a ditierence in terms ot
broadcast power. of course.

Linda Levinson. another
treshman. agreed when she said.
“1 would have worked hard tor
credit. but I'm tinding mysell
spending too much time for the
grade." Many appear to think that
the tutorial has lost sight oi its

could be received well only a few

“if the intent ot the tutorial is to
be an introductory course. it
should not attempt to match the
pace of other courses," Levinson
said.
