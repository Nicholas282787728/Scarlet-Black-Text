The Olym

by Robert Quashie

Five Canadian nockey players
were disqualiﬁed from competi-
tion in this year's Winter Olymr
pics because they allegedly signed
professional contracts with teams
in the NHL prior to the games.
Herschel Walker and Willie Gault
were both barred from Olympic
competition as sprinters when
they signed contracts as profes-
sional football players, on the
other side of the coin, athletes who
train within the Soviet bloc for the
most part are either armed {area
”officers” or true to Marxist doc,
trine and are allowed to practice
their means oi production’ far
from the harassment and en-
cumberments of the economic
lifestyle; that is they are born and
raises as athletes.

Rounding out the world of
amateur athletes we have a ijnishr
mash of government subsidations,
Olympic training centers, corn
porate sponsorships and out and
out rulesdodging by athletes and
nations in order to compete in this
grand tradition. The World Olym-
pic Committee needs to re-think
its guidelines and rules on profes-
sionalism in the Olympic games.

To begin with, there must be a
new definition of wht constitu
amateur status. The first def‘
tion given for an amateur by the
American Colicge Dictionary is:
”One who cultivates any study or
art or other activity for personal
pleasure instead of professionally
or for gain.”

By this definition, the only true
amateur left in the world today is
the weekend athlete His or her
only gain is personal satisfaction.
what about the Olympic athlete?
Isn’t the attainment of personal
excellence at the heart of the
Olympic spirit? By the same
reasoning, don‘t we all go to col-
lege only in order to “get into’
ourselves? Right; who needs a
degree?

The Olympic athlete of today
has two of three possible goals in
mind The first of which is the at-
tainment oi personal excellence.
but the second is to prove that his
or her country is the best and the
third is a career after the games
Deep in our collective societal
minds, we all believe that by provn
ing ourselves in the Olympic
Games, we have proved
something intrincically good
about our national character. As
for the third int, it is ludicrous

Men’s Swimming

The Grinnell College men's
swimming team will be trying to
continue a long Winning streak
when it travels to Dubuque, 1a.,
Saturday. Feb 18, for the sixth an-
nual Iowa Small College Chamr
pionship Meet. The Pioneers have
won all five previous state meets,
but Coach Ray Obermiller an»
ticipaes a torrid 3-way struggle
with Luther and Coe for this
year’s crown. Coe was third with
242 tallies

The Pioneers won their sixﬂi
consecutive Buddha Invitational
title last Saturday, topping a
G-team field that included strong
squads from Missouri-St. Louis,
Augustana»lll., and Creighton.

The Flame of Competition:

 

to believe that anyone who has
trained in a sport for most of their
life, will be willing to walk away
from their dedication after one
‘ultimate' competition.

Therefore, if the athlete is work-
ing towards a gain, be it a
monetary or patriotic reason,
isn’t this athlete making his or her
sport a profession? Furthermore,
is it any more professional for a
sprinter to play a contract sport
than for the Us. hockey team to
do a national ad, or for a nation to
run a SubSidized sports program?

The Olympic committee and the
entire world of sports needs to
follow the path taken by every
other scientific discipline to date
The Olympic Committee must de-
emphasize philosophy and placea
new importance and weight upon
statements of verifiable fact, This
is not a call for the total abandons
ment of the Olympic ideals, Far
from that, they should remain as
guidelines to future action, but
decisions about status must be
based on the facts at hand, not
some amorphous term such as
“amateur".

it is simply unfair tor the Olymr
pic Committee to allow a nation to

send its best athlete to the game
via a loophole which says that he
or she is being subsidized as a
soldier, while barring the way of
another because he of she chooses
to earn a living in another sport.
Let us be realistic — when was the
last time we saw a figureeskater
from El Salvador? Athletes with
funding compete, those without it
don't.

The new criteria should be
established in the light of two
seemingly contradictory but
workable tenets. First, if an
athlete does not earn a living in
the specific sport in which he or
she desires to compete, then that
athlete should not be barred from
competition. Second, and even
more fundamental, the Olympics
are for Art; leave the competition
to the World Cups Staying within
these limitations, we will be able
to avoid an olympiad which would
award the best paid athlete and
the medals will go the those whom
have achieved the highest level of
perfection in their Sport. On the
other hand, if some future
Baryshnikov were to learn to
skate, i wouldn't care how much
he made as a dancer, [want to see
him skate.

Roundball

be making their final appearance
of 1983784, by hosting Coe in a

team in First in the South, This
was Grinnell's fourth victory in
six outings

The Scarlet and Black dropde

January 17, but feel it was a game
they could have won: and a loss
they intend to avenge.

ball team fueled by Deb
Eastman’s 25 points downed Mar-
shalltown Community College
71-55, Monday night in Darby, The
Pioneers jumped out to a 39-24
halt time lead, using a deliberate
oiiensiveattack designed to set up
high percentage inside shots, The
bulk of Eastman's scoring came
from inside passes and the
Pioneers shot a respectable 47
percent from the field.

”We played rather sloppily —
though we did hit boards," said
Head Coach Cathie Schweitzer.

against a smaller Marshalltown
team, snatching so rebounds to
Marshalltown's 24, Freshman Liz
Schumacher added 10 points and
nabbed 11 rebounds for the
Pioneers

Turnovers and free throws pro-
ved to he the low mark of the
Pioneer performance. “The more
you run, the more turnovers you
have. We turned over the ball
more, but we had a few more
steals," said Coach Schweitzer.
Grinnell committed 19 turnovers

Though spring is the season
when a young man’s fancy turns
to love, it also happens to be the
season when two of Grinnell’s spr»
ing sports clubs, rugby and
women's soccer, begin their main
action.

The Grinnell Rugby Club.
coached by native Grinnellian Joe
Phipps, has begun its spring
workouts in Darby gym, every
Monday and Wednesday night at 9
p,m, The hard wood floor becomes
the site of practice sessions for
one of the roughest sports around.

Greg Donovan, a back for the
team, said that in these practices
the stress is not on inflicting pain,
but on “conditioning and teaching
newcomers the fundamentals of
the sport.” Comparing his posts
tion with that of a free safety in
American football, Donovan
stated that it is the backs who nor»
mally “get the glory,"

Donovan also mentioned that
rugby is “not as bad as it looks.”
He added that it is “quite
calculated with a lot of strateg’
involved.” The Rugby Club plays
mainly against other college and
town clubs. The spring campaign
begins April 7, against Beaver
Creek of Apppleton, iowa, in Ap
pleton.

Another spring sperm club to
begin its season is the Women’s
Soccer Club. Headed by player-
coach Lou Ellen Stedman, they
are now practicing indoors to
prepare for two indoor tours
naments: a Feb 25 tourney in
Cedar Falls and a tournament
that will be held at Grinnell on
March a, Stedman says the team
will begin to play outdoors after
spring break.

The team has been practicing
three basics of soccer play: drib—
bling, passing, and working
together, as well as scrimmaging
at the end of each session. Stedr
man stressed that to be a member
takes “a lot of personal extra ei-
fort,” She adds that the women
are “not just there tO kick around,
we are there to play soccer."
Aiter acknowledging that they are
not lacking members, thirty have
signed up already, Stedman did
mention that “anybody is
welcome "

The club, which has only three
seniors, will be hosting the Third
Annual Grinnell Women’s Soccer
Tournament on April 14. Games
will be played both on Ward Field
and on the 10th Avenue Field.
