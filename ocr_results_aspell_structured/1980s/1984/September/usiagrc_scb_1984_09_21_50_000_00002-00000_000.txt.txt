Effect Campus Too

by Hora “'illil’l.

On August 15, twenty three war-
rants were issued ior possession
and/or use of illegal drugs in the
town of Grinnell. Eleven arrests
have resulted from the warrants
and according to Detective Doug
Shutts. who headed the in-
vestigatin. more arrests will be
made.

“No effort was made to ignore
drugs on campus.” commented
Dave McConnell. Mayor of Grins
nell, “The college is certainly not
a haven above the law. and action
will be taken if necessary."

But, the undercover investiga
tion which has been ongoing over
the past two years. has not includ-
ed the college,

McConnell pointed out that the
campus is not the same as it once
was. in earlier years the campus
has been clearly more actively in
volved with drugs.

“Regardless oi who is doing it.

police will use the appropriate
means to stop it." McConnell
stated. and then cautioned
students to "Be Sensmvc and
smart it they are using drugs.“

blame. though, must rest on Joyce
himself. Kenner told his audience.
“Joyce had the typical hand-
writing oi an Irishman educated
in the 19th century, which means
it was totally illegible." he said.

Portiow of his original drafts
were inrlrmprelielisible. In addi-
tion. he added hand written inserr
tions to the prooi sheets he was
sent by the printers in France.

to be sensible, but there‘s really

remarked one student.

Most students agreed that.
though drugs may be less ap-
parent, they are as abundant as
ever. Students at the drug
oriented Alice In Wonderland par-
ty earlier this year, were not ins
hibited at all by the summer drug
bust.

"I'm not the least bit nervous
about getting busted and my
friends aren't either." another
student commented.

Nonetheless, some dealers are
being more careiul this year.

"You Just have to watch who
you sell to," one dealer stated,
"No one is going to go to town and
sell to the high school. that's

Another student pointed out that
drugs usually are not as prevalent
in the fall as at othet times of the
year The graduation ol the senior
class has reduced the number 01
drug users. and many oi the
ireshmen that use drugs have not
yet found connections on campus.

touristy things to do was to smug-
gle an edition home on one’s
return from the continent. This
spawned an entire industry
centered around counterieiting
Ulysses.

In 1936. Random House. decided
to bring the book to America. The
idea was to bring a copy through
customs. hoping that it would be
seized then tight the case through
the courts. ii the one copy was
allowed into the country then the
ban on the book was eiiectively
lifted.

The copy the company chose to
bring in turned out to be a
counterfeit edition. Random
House tried to patch the book but
this only made things worse.

Just prior to ww1, Sylvia
Beech. a matron of Joyce‘s alid a
book store owner in Paris, began
to go broke. To save herself finan-

‘had stored in the basement or her
shop. This "junk" included galley
sheets and proois oi Ulysses. ,

Why Another Publication

By Juliathuil ui-etsiug

Politically speaking. ”things
are sometimes onesided here at
Grlnnell." says senior John Soars
baro, coeditor oi Grinnell's new
conservative Journal, The outcry
”We hope to articulate the other
side oi these arguments '-

Sharbaro. along with senior lan
ivlacLean. plan to release the iii-st
edition oi what they envision as an
articulate medium for conserr
vative thought the weekend oi
September 22

For purposes of their Journal.
the editors outline a very speciiic
conception ol conservatism. "Uur
deiinition oi conservative is based
upon the classic liberal model,"
Sbarbam says. “We emp asize
the importance oi indi idual
rights." A critical reevaluation oi
the role ol government will iigure
prominently.

MacLean iirst conceived The
Outcry during the 15334984 school
year. Along with sbarbaro. he
began collecting start writers and
acquiring iunding ior publication
this semester.

They began with $200 irom a
private contributor. later ‘they
received additional private dona-
tions and a small amount of col-
lege iunding. They plan to appear
beiore IFC this week.

Also, a Washington based con-
servative group that iunds other
such journals will examine the
first few issues to consider The
outcry ior iunding.

As projected. The Outcry will
appear once a month. It will con-
sist of two legal-size sheets
printed on both sides. “Right now,
we have about 12 people writing
[or us," says Sbarbaro, “but we
hope to attract more once we smrt
printing." Most articles will locus
on national issues. he said,

According to Sbarbaro. The
Outcry will serve two purposes: it
will create a medium for
disseminating conservative
thought on campus. and provide a
means of exchange between op-
posing viewpoints, He heavily em»
phasizes the latter

“We want to create a dialogue
between conservatives and

liberals." he said "And itcn the

material. we intend to print
arguments troin both sides oi any
issue." Towards this end.
materials from readers will often

be printed in addition to the staff's
work; a regular [eature will also
allow interested readers to ex-
change their opinions with those
of the editors

"At every level oi government
action. we ask "ls this
necessary?” he said

Articles dealing with other com-
monly held conservative doc
trtnes, such as support ol a strong
deiense and an aggressive ioreign
policy. will also appear,

In spite oi Tlic Outcry's
acknowledged conservative
perspective. Sbarbaro insists that
the journal is nonpartisan “We
are neither Democrat nor
Republican." he said. "And sup-
port no speeiiic candidates in the
upcoming election. We see
ourselves as ideologues."

The journal will primarily ad
dress national issues. with very
little emphasis on local or campus
airairs. "Vie are not a campus
paper, We are not trying to com-
pete with the Scarlet and Black, In
tact. we hope to eventually share
their best writers."

Above all other things, Sbarr
baro stresses quality.“1i1'he Out-
cry is going to appear at all. it will
be a class publication," he says.
"We want liberals to read it with
flashlights under the covers,"

Topic. Domestic Violence

According to a Harris poll, 20
percent oi all Americans approve
of hitting a spouse on appropriate
occasions, Frightening revela-

Americans."
