My God, what have we done?

by Nicholas McNamara

Lately, I have observed a
irightening phenomenon taking
place in one oi the most inﬂuential
sectors oi our modern society.

Within the obese realm oi mass
media, specifically in the swollen
putts oi the television and movie
industry, a new enthusiasm to
present an old and dangerous
theme has resuriaced. Out oi the
swampy side oi the pool which is
shallow in some parts and deep in
others, blue and clear in some
places and a quagmire in others,
has risen the smelly beast oi the

fifties known as the legacy-ofr ,

McCarthy.

It‘s true, for I myself have seen
this heelhound, this viper, this
devil incarnate, And even here, in
our own bucolic home of Grinnell,
this fiend I speak of has come to
feed on the young and old alike,
Gritting its chauvinist teeth.
showing its racist claws,
breathing its jingoistic iire, the
legacy-of-McCarthy lives again on
the movie and television screens
of our cities and homes.

Playing now at the one and only
theatre in Grinnell, is MGM's film
called “Red Dawn". 1 must admit
my reluctance to, in a sense, an-
nounce this showing. for fear of it
giving the trim more publicity.
Nevertheless, “Red Dawn" is one
of the laces of the Hydraheaded-
hag known as the legacy-of-
McCarthy. and it is my responr
sibility tseriouslyl to warn you
against it.

The plot is simple (in every
sense of the world), The Soviet
Union/Russians/Commune
ists/Bad Guys invade Small-Town
U.s.A. (why, we never know)
which in turn is defended by
SmalleTown's high school football
team, i.e. the Wolverines/Loyal
Americans/Young Republie
cans/Good Guys. Again, the plot
itseli is empty and weak. But the
message oi the iilm is very signifi»
cant and extremely hazardous to
be showing to anyone, especially
the twelve to seventeen year old
audience, for which films of this
nature are intended. The poisoned
lesson of ”Red Dawn" is that we
should prepare ior a Soviet-
American war In light of this we
would be wise to stop — no,
eliminate, the Communist threat
before it takes over every sm ll

town in the United States. And
finally, that when that is when, no
if, the glorious holy war against
the “evil empire" comes we
should all be ready to kill and kill
and diet ”Red Dawn": boasting,
bouncing, blustering jingoism at
its very worst.

But the savage legacy-ofr
McCarthy can be more sly and
more sutble than a vaunt movie
like ”Red Dawn”. With
remarkable ease it can produce
teary-eyed, goose-bumpy feelings
of devout patriotism But beware,
you Yankee Doodle wimps. For as
iast as a single bullet can ily, your
saccharine can easily be turned
into Nazi-like nationalism. The

which ever existed in the history

Goebbels. the Olympics were
clearly a tool oi progaganda ior
the “New McCarthians". Their
transparent attempt to cultivate
redrwhiteeand-blue babies and an-
them humming drones echoed
Orwell's prophetic 1984. The
brazen and false claims made
throughout the Olympics, both
directly by commentators and in-
directly by its overall tone, was
not only an insult to the spirit or
athletics, but was also a vain and
odious assault on every other
country in the world, whether they
attended the Olympics or not.

But ABC (or should we call it
the Ministry of Truth now) scored
again when it promoted un-
precedented commercial time,
and showed with unprecedented
shamelessness the madeeforfl‘V
movie “Call To Glory". I didn't
see all of this show, but what I did
see, and what i picked up from
dozens of maudlin commercials
during the Olympics, was quite
enough to prove to me that this
was yet another horrid [ace of this
ghoulish legacy that networks
currently love so much. The

that is) when everyone hated the

Yet is is with melancholy
nostalgia that ABC's “Call To
Glory" looked back to those
simpler days, Then all things
were black and white, We were
always right, “they" were always
wrong. As sad as it is that those
days are gone, however. “Call To
Glory" rings with new hope.
Dreams oi a new generation oi
communistehating, war-loving
soldiers is what “Call To Glory"
ultimately leaves us with. In the
film itself this new generation of
jousters is realized by a young
child; a child who salutes as his
lather is shot down and killed; a
child who (as any John Bircher
would hope) will grow up to iight
and kill the communists, as his
father had taught him.

And how about us? Is this what
we want to teach our children?
Are these the aspects of American
Culture which we want to share?
Are these the values of the mass
public which watches primertime
TV? 1 have no answers, only
fears.

Letter to the Editor

Dear Editor:

i sit here this late evening
beiore classes begin in earnest,
and i am again pressed with
thoughts which seem to have
unlimited room to hang around in
the space tloosely, reierrred to as
my brain) not yet filled with
thoughgs oi religion. psychology,
computers and God knows what
else, and the body still squishing
with the beer of this week’s
“NSD” revelry. It is these few
ideas A or more accurately, ieel.
ings 7 which I would like to share
with you. i thereiore ask ior your
indulgence and your time to read
a iew lines and perhaps let things
hang around in your own space.

During the summer when iwiis
a real person, as opposed to being
a student, it struck me that when I
am in student mode, my attention
focuses on many things — the
majority oi which concern whatto
do to bc a student. I’m sure you
know What 1 mean. When is this
paper due, what do 1 have to read
beforc this cup of calfeine races
out oi my body, and where's the
party? And, i tend to lose track oi
what i'm doing here because I'm
so busy doing it. So, here l am
with fuzzy brain and pen in hand
chugging out ideas With the hope
that by doing so there will be an

“Enola Gay". For those or you
who don‘t know, “Enola Gay" is
the name of the 3-29 bomber
which dropped the Atomic Bomb
on Hiroshima, Japan, (Incidental-
ly, the Enola Gay was named by
the pilot, Col. P.W, Tibbets, in
honor of his mother. Enola Gay
Haggard. A rather morbid way
to honor one's mother, don’t you
think?) The film itself chronicles
the events leading up to the top
secret mission oi dropping the
first atomic bomb, affectionally
known as “Little Boy". A great
deal of the movie focuses on the
idealized lives of the crew of the
plane.

From the objectively critical
point of view the film was aboslute
rubbish, The characters were
each and every one the
sterotypicai soldiers oi the worse
kind. handsome, robust, and ooze
ing with more machismo than
John Wayne himself. They had the
combined personality oi a twelve
inch “He»Man" doll, The last 20
mintues of the movie was little
more than watching the crew sit
at their instrument panels and oc-
casionally read off numbers and
other data. Realistic perhaps, but
still about as interesting as watr
ching a digital clock turn over. I
would have been able to sleep, had
it not been ior the abrupt musical
changes from a stringy, celestial
sort oi sound to a booming, brassy
marchvlike time.

But the thing that upset me the
most about ”Enola Gay". was the
way in which it ialsely protrayed
the city oi Hiroshima. The things
that the US, military and political
strategists said directly about
Hiroshima. and the way in which
the overrun footage of a Japanese
training base served as an im
plicit indication oi the whole city.
This emphasized Hiroshima as a
strategic and vital center of
Japanese military activity, thus
making it a legitimate target for
nuclear elimination.

But this was hardly true.

I've already mentioned how a
Japanesse training base served as
the symbol for Hiroshima
throughout “Enola Gay" and it is
in tact ture that an army/marine
training base was destroyed by
the bomb. To be precise, six
military targets were destroyed,
' 1d a clothin de ta r

impetus to save them ior the ba
gage compartment in my brain
tTom Brozoski, forgive me).

Hmmm, “Rather a long»winded
and vague introduction," you
say? “Sounds like she's already
lost her brain, So what. who cares
about all oi this?" you add. Well,
this is exactly my point. Who
cares about all of this? Not 1.
Otherwise I wouldn't be writing
this but would be doing the thing i
am urging both oi us to do, and
that is DON'T GET DOST! Don't
get lost in your own head. Don’t
get lost in this 90 acre campus and
what lies outside of Grinnell’s
borders. And if you do think about
what is out there, don't get lost in
cynicism and apathy.

What 1 am asking us to do is to
take a student break every once in
a while to just step back for a mo,
ment. Look around. What do you
see that instead oi cr' 'zing you
would like to change? Look at
politics. the economy, the environ
ment, yourseii. or anything else
that matters to you, Then, DO
something. it seems to me that a
very pervasive force on this and
other campuses ls educated
apathy. and perhaps it is the very
process oi expending so much
energy acquiring an education
which tends to make us unrcspon:
sive to other things that really
matter ill our world. I apoligize to

visions center and four other low
level military complexes. In all,
6.000 Japanese troops were killed;
a considerable number of lives to
be sure,

But why did NBC‘s film show us
only the military loses at
Hiroshima? Why didn't “Enola
Gay” paint out that 27 schools
were demolished and 2,000 school
children killed? Why weren’t we
shown at seven o'clock Sunday
night that three hospitals, or the
15 train stations or the nine village
business districts which were ali
leveled by our atomic bomb? And
most of all, where were the faces
and the bodies of the 130,000
civilians that died quite unex-
pectedly one morning, as a result
of this heroic mission’!

Clearly “Enola Gay” was not
produced to be entertaining or
historically accurate. but simply
to persuade millions oi viewers
that the use oi nuclear weapons is
not such a bad thing.

The legacy-of-MCCarthy would
have us believe that there is no
differnece between the soldiers
and the noncombatants of the so-
called emeny. Those that hold this
attitude don't care that for every
one soldier killed in Hiroshima, 22
civilians perished. They don‘t
care that use or nuclear weapons
entirely outbounds the just war
theory as it has historiclaly been
taught, “But America is too great
to be morally wrong," they claim,
“just think oi the Olympics."

But I'm asking you to reject this
beastly attitude Offered by the
legacyeol‘eMcCarthy. Say no to
jingoisin. racism and hatred.
Turn instead to repentance. We
must go to the world and ask
iorgiveness ior uie crimes oi our
nation.

In real life, the c0vpilor of the ,
Enola Gay was Capt. R.A. Lewis.
Feeling the shock of “Little Bay"
as it instantly hit Hiroshima, turn-
ing it into ash, it's reported that
Lewis said. “My God. what have
we done?"

For us today. as we view movies
and experience atitudes which
gloriiy war. insprie us to hate, and
honor some of the lowest periods
oi our history, let us remember
his sensitive words. and add to
them, “My God, help us to do on-
ferently in the future."

P
etic. or who, perhaps. are
ot so tired But, i don't
apol‘ ze to myself or to anyone
else who simply pays lip service to
ideals or who berates the status
quo while being completely ab
sorbed by it,

Our world is filled with too
many wonderful things for us not
to take advantage of all that is
good and to make what is not good
better. We cannot afford to allow
ourselves to become lost in our
own small worlds, and we cannot
afford to take our ideals and
belieis ior granted expecting
them to magically transform the
world only because we have
thought oi them.

Alright, enough lecture 1 just
hope that this has made some
sense and that someone out there
will want to take a student break.
Better yet. it would be very niceii
we could integrate our activities
as students with committments
(or awareness combined with ac
tion) both inside and outside of the
realm of Grinnell, I think it is ,m,
portant. even vital, that we be
concerned, active people, and I
urge you to think about that, For
now. 1 would be content to hear if
anyone has any reaction to my
rather cathartic babble, II so,
please. take a load oii. grab a
cookie, and let me know , 7 ileli. ‘
