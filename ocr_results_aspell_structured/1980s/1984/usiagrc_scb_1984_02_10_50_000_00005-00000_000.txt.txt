100 days 7 thats it, just loo
days,

For most people, the 100 days
party signals the home-stretch 7
only we more days to study,
drink, have fun.

For the senior, it signals the
beginning of the final countdown.
As the days remaining dwindle to
double digits a certain apprehen-
sion bordering on fear crops up in
the bears and minds of scores of
seniors,

When you’re a freshman four
years seems like an eternity and
the thought of leaving here some-
day never really occurs. But now,
as seniors, we ieel as though New
Student Days couldn't have been
more than, oh, two, three months

Letters ‘

Porndgraphy
is not
pleasant

To the Editor,

I recently received a letter from
a friend in Pennsylvania. As I was
responding to it, I was struck by
the thought of sending my
response not only to her, but also
to the 5&3.

She wrote to me, “I had a terrir
ble disappointment a few weeks
ago.” She saw her first X-rated
movie, and “. r . on the whole it
was really boring, contrived and

more of a turnoff than a turn-on. ,

It was a let—down, as I’d never
seen one, and had been anxious to
satisfy my curiousity. Have you
ever seen one? Did you like it?
Maybe it‘s just me,”

1 have seen many pornographic
movies, books, and magazines,
and I responded to her, “I don’t
like pornography. Not only is it
‘boring, contrived and a turnoff}
as you said, but it lies about
women. Pornography literally
means ‘writings about prostitutes
(or female sex slavesl,‘ and it
spreads lies that women enjoy be-
ing dominated and raped, that
they mean ‘yes’ when they- say
‘no,’ and that they love men with
big sex organs. Blech.
Theoretically,
erotic, loving sex between two
equal people portrayed on a
screen, but it doesn't happen very
often.

“Pornography is manuiactured
by syndicated crime, and they ex~
ploit, hurt, and even kill women
and children. (Have you ever
heard of ‘snuff films’." Women are
murdered with lots oi struggle,
blood, and mutilations, for real,
and it is all filmed, for the sexual
pleasure-of men.)

“Even “Playboy” circulates
myths about women m the ‘ideal’
woman is 18 years old, long-
limbed, bigrbusted, made~up, air-
brushed, and completely on
natural looking. Not a single zit or
mole. Women just don't really
look like that, and shouldn’t be
pressured to spend their money
and their time trying.

“These movies and magazines
give men extremely unreal expec-
tations of women, and leads, I
believe, to unhealthy fantasies,
Some studies have recently sug
gested a link between viewing
hardcore pornography at a young
age and becoming a rapist and
abuser of women. As Robin
Morgan, a well-known ieminist,
said, ‘Pornography is the theory,
rape the practice,’

“There are presently attempts

there could be ,

ago. .right’!

This irrational urge exists to
say “Stop 7 wait a minute.
There’s been a mistake here. I’m
not 2i, I have no sense of responr
sibility and even less maturity.
I’m not ready for the ‘rcal world'.
Catch me in about four years,
okay?”

Intellectually, we all realize the
time has come to move on, life
continues and all that good stuff.
Even a sense of exhilaration
arises, the thrill of getting out on
your own and knocking them all
dead. But emotionally the urge to
resist cutting the cord remains
strong.

In one sense, it’s probably good
to be reluctant to give up these,

A charge

by Daniel Klatz

You’ve heard of academic
dishonesty — but how about ad-
ministrative dishonesty? it's hap
pening, right here at honest Grins
nell, over at Macy House, home of
the Dean of Students, Jim Teder-
man. His actions of the past few
weeks have been highly unproies
sional, unethical, deceptive, and
border on being slanderous. Con»
sider the tollowing examples:

Mr, Tederman has a long and
well-known history of problems
with Ms. Georgia Dentel, perfor-
ming programs and activities
counselor. Just ask any student
who has been involved in social
programming (concerts, films)
over the last five years 7 Jim
Tederman does not approve oi the
way Georgia Dentel does her job,
and he doesn't let her forget it,
The problem was so bad last year
that I, along with then Social Coor-
dinator Allison Paich, went to
President Drake to discuss the
matter. Given this background, it
came as no surprise when Ms.
Dentel's position was included in

in Minneapolis and some other
cities to make pornography a civil
rights offense againstwomen. I
support these attempts whole
heartedly.”

Feminism
issue \
addressed

To the Editor,

The study and practice of true
ieminism has been the topic of
great debate on the walls of Burl»
ing’s bathroom and, now, in the
5&8.

The knowledge of true feminism
belongs only to the erudite. This
knowledge is not fixed, for our
knowledge is subject to historical
amnesia and the growth of
feminist knowledge is stunted by
complacency and by assimilation
to the Patriarchy.

The topic oi Catherine ln~
grassia’s article (5&8 Feb. 3,
1984) is the relationship between
ieminism and sexual appeal. She
quotes, out of context, from
feminist texts, “Thou shalt not try
to be desirable to men" to Show
that feminists claim that a true
feminist should not be desirable to
men. The correct passage is.“.. .. ..

 

‘the best years oi your life To
leave here with a sense of the bit-
tersweet is possibly to preserve
the memory oi these years with
care. Still, this gnawing mought
sits in back of your head; the
wandering ‘If these are the best
years 'of my life, where do I go
from here?‘ Potentially the pro-
spect could be bleak.

Yet are these really. the
brightest years, or do these just
seem that way because they're
the most simple?

In the film “The Big Chill”, one
-of the characters explains why
these college years seem so
golden — of course we were all
friends, lt was easy then, with
very few demands. it’s outside in

of administrative dishonesty

Mr. ’I‘ederman’s budget cuts, Yet
to justify this cut, he has gone
much too far.

Several weeks ago I was in his
office and he suggested to me that
Ms. Dental was overpaying
several jazz and blues perr
formers. l-le sighted one example
where Grinnell paid more than
another school, the University of
Michigan, He also told S,G.A,
President Jon Scharff this same
fact. He never discussed the mat-
ter with Ms, Dentel, yet he deem~
ed it appropriate for discussion
with students. This is a highly unr
proiessional way of dealing with
personnel. There is no excuse for
it, yet it is only hali oi the story.

Tederman's figures were ex-
tremely deceiving and I explained
this to him, yet, the next week, he
continued to stand by his story to
the 5&8. There were several fac7
tors which may have contributed
to me price difference 7 the day
of the week on which each perfor-
mance occurred (Grinnell's con-
cert was a Saturday, the most ex-
pensive night ior entertainment),

thou shalt not try to be desirable
to men; thou shalt be desirable in
thine own eyes and let thee he ate
tracted to thou at thee’s
preference.” Clearly, one should
be aiming at being attractive to
herself, however it is that she
finds herself attractive and coma
formble.

. Catherine lngrassia states that
a woman who holds feminist
beliefs can Shave her legs and
wear cosmetics. Why would a
woman want to shave and wear
cosmetics? If she finds it attracV
tive, then her feminist beliefs
have not been effective in enabl-
ing her to recognize the source oi
her standards of beauty.

A true feminist understands
that her goal is to fulfill her poten
tial as a human being by defining
herself in terms that she has
chosen, not the terms that society
has imposed upon her. We would
like to reconstruct the statement
into a question: Can a woman who
holds feminist beliefs shave her
legs and wear cosmetics? There
may be a few who can answer
sincerely in the affirmative.
Though, until women learn how to
jog three miles in high heels and
figure how to work on Wall Street
without wearing stockings and
cosmetics (yet, still receiving one-
third less pay for the same work),
the answer must be a majority no.

Catherine Ingrassia was correct
in stating that true feminists need
to maintain a balance between
ieminist dogma and personal
preferences in beauty. in order to
achieve this' balance a ,true
feminist should shave only one leg

. and let die other be hairy. A true

the type of tour the artist was on
’Grinnell’s performer was on a
limited threeday tour), and the
fact that Ann Arbor Michigan is a
much larger, more jazz—oriented
market. By suggesting that Grins
nell (Ms. Dental) got a bad deal,
without the necessary full
understanding of the situation was
unethical, unnecessary and
borders on being slanderous.
Tederman was concluding that
Ms. Dentel, on-that occasion, did
not do a good job. The group had
wanted moo more than we paid,
because of the distance they had
to travel, but Ms. Dentel
negotiated a very good price.
Another example of
Tederman’s administrative
dishonesty occurred last week.
when he told 5&8 Editor Jeff Rays
mond that Ms, Dentel had until
February lo to decide whether or
not to accept the newly con-
structed position. This statement
was not true. i spoke with Presi-
dent Drake the day before the
SMS came out and he assured me
that there was no Such date. MS.

ieminist can put on makeup in
thirty seconds or less and a
radical feminist does not even
need eleven seconds,

Today, true leminism is pracr
tically extinct. The survival of
true feminism demands that
women have the courage to be
honest to themselves and to the
world about their standards of
beauty. The restrictive standards
of the Patriarchial system must
be redefined so that women can
fulfill their potential to become
complete and independent per-
sons.

Can one hold TRUE feminist
beliefs and still 'have a sense of
humor? 7 Mary Jane Constant

To the Editor, ..

I would like to respond to
Catherine Ingrassia’s article
“Mixing Feminism with
Femininity”. She covers the topic
of feminists who wear cosmetics
and shave, and her article states:
“Obviously, perhaps all too ob»
viously, it comes down to a matter
of personal choice. A woman can
hold feminist beliefs, shave her
legs and wear cosmetics” (em-
phasis mine). The article seems to

Dentel had never been informed
of such a date, yet Tederman in-
sisted that this was the case.

One has to wonder why,Tederr
man acts this way. What kind of
professional twists facts to form
his/her case? These incidents call
into question Tederman's honesc
ty, professionalism, and ability to
administrate in a fair manner. I
stand by my story and challenge
Tederman to discuss these allegar
tions at any time, in any place 7
just call me up and we'll arrange
a public forum.

As the situation currently
stands, i can see only two possible
solutions: Either the realization
by Mr. Tederman that Ms Dentel
does a line job and a resulting lair
contract offer or a full scale in-
vestigation of the situation by the
president, the iaculty and the
students.

At a school where academic
dishonesty is handled with severi-
ty, administrative dishonesty
should be handled in a similar
manner.

imply that whether or not a
woman shaves her legs is a choice
between two equally acceptable
alternatives. _

I would like to argue that not
shaving one’s legs is not an accep-
table alternative in our society.
when I stopped shaving my legs, I
became the object of stares and
rude comments, and was even
told that not shaving was
“disgusting. " I believe mat this is
the attitude of society in general
— and itis easy tolose sightoi this
attitude' in a college environment.
Therefore, women do not really
have a free choice; it is conform.
or be subject to disapproval. We
may believe that we are freely
“choosing" to wear cosmetics and
shave, but are we? Or is it
society’s pressures that makes us
feel our need to do these things?
We may argue that we do not feel
these pressures, yet every day we
are subject to a barrage of ads
that say we need to spend time,
energy. and especially money on
products that will “make us
sexy".

With the pressures of botl‘ ‘ocie-
ty and the advertising wori :on-
stantly around us, is it any wonder
that most women make the Socials
ly acceptable Choice? Of course
there is nothing wrong with wane
ting to be sexy, but sexy on whose
terms? And why must we spend so
much energy worrying about it? I
will not go so far as to say that a
woman who shaves and wears
cosmetics cannot have feminist
ideals. I will say, however, that
any serious feminist should ex-
amine her motives for doing so, 7
