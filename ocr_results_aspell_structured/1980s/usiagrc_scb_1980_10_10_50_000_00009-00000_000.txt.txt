at the faculty meeting this past Monr
day. No reasons for faculty disap»
proval were cited by Volker. “Depart-
ments with labs have a valid complaint.
There are some faculty members who
believe that with the liberal policy we
have of being able to skip classes when
we want, the faculty should not cater to
the childish whim of wanting a day off.“
Volker emphasized that he did not
hold anything against the. faculty
because of the vote. "I don't feel hostile
toward the faculty. ldo feel very disap»
pointed I thought that we had an honest
request made in good faith, that we had
gone through the proper channels, and
felt that what we had provided was a
good Skip Day, a day when faculty and
students could take a day off,"
However, the idea has not yet been
dropped. Volker said that he would still
like to see a great amount oi planning
for some type of spring festival day,
although he wasn't sure just what torm
it would take. His major regret was that

it would be more difficult to produce
something of substance while ”working

against the racuity." However. he
stressed the hope that Skip Day would
not become a major issue in his ad
ministration, saying. “I hope that there
will be other accomplishments which
will carry more weight.”

One of the accomplishments Volker is
hoping for is the introduction of greater
efficiency in SGA. Volker Cited the lack
of information from past years as a
handicap which has had to oeovercome
in getting started this year, The
refrigerator rental program was one
example offered. “How can you plan
for reirigerator rental when you have
no idea what the demand was last
year?" asked Volker. He also pointed
out that there were no records of SGA
minutes for some recent years. “We're
hoping to leave a good record of what
we‘ve done,” he added.

Volker also hopes to improve efficien-
cy in the area of committee structure.
Joint Board recently approved the
undertaking of a study to review the
SGA committees, a move which stem-
med from problems in administrating
these committees earlier in the year.
Despite efforts to coordinate all of the
committees and appoint members.
Volker said, "In the past month we've
found one or two with no students" He
is in favor of the committee method of
legislating, and he hopes that the com~
pleted study will provide an inventory
of the committees on campus as well as

a means for either improving or
eliminating those which are presently
doing little or no work.

The increase in the number of ser-
vices offered by the student coor-
dinator’s office is also seen as an in-
crease in efficiency hy Volker. He
stated, “This is important, Most
students don't give a damn about Joint
Board meetings, but these services
meet their needs and are an effective
allocation of the money. "

As SGA president Volker is also the
head of Joint Board. He sees the main
function of Joint Board as being the
allocation of the Student Activity Fee.
Volker points out that nearly all enters
tainment other than athletics is
organized by students and decisions
must be made about how the available
money Will be appropriated. “I don't
mean Just what everyone talks about:
films and concerts,” said Volker.
"Students like to get together in groups
and do things. I think that's important.
too, and it bothers me when we can‘t
give them the money they need.
Hopefully, we'll be able to do a better
job if we raise our income.”

Volker also feels that Joint Board

should be involved in providing com-
mentary on issues and should have the
ability to help shape campus policy. He
also stated, “It’s good for us to give a
forum to issues not directly concerned
with campus life, such as ERA, draft
registration, and the war in Iraq. .lust'
because we can t force anybody to
listen to us doesn t mean we can’t give,
them (the ideas) forum "

Regarding his cabinet, Volker has on-.
ly praise. “I'm very pleased. They‘re
all super people." After a moment’s,
reflection he added, “It‘s perhaps too
early to tell. Past administrations have,
started out well and then fallen to‘
pieces. This may be premature, but at'
this point I really feel fortunate,”

Volker offered this summary of his
administration thus far. “in general,.
I’m pleased with the way things have‘
been running this year. I feel that I need
to spend a lot of time doing this job.
Sometimes it bums me; there are other,
demands for my time. Sometimes little
discouragements come down trom the
faculty. in. still having fun, though.
There are things we want to accomplish
and I’m still optimistic about ac»
complishing them." 9
