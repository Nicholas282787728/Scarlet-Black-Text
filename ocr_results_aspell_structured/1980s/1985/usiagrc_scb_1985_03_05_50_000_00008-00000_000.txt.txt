Decision Making

There seems to be a problem on this
campus. We have all heard tor
ourselves initiatedl cries about our
alienation from the decisionamakers at
Grinnell .7 the Administration and the
faculty. Changes seem to drop irom the
sky; buffer days disappear lrom the
horizon, homes We knew and loved are
transformed into sanitary rooms. as
personable as a hospital or a dorm.
faculty members whose classes we
clambered to get into are let go from
the college. “Where were we when
these decisions were made?” we pro-
testl

OK. the problem is that studenw don't
seem to have enough input in decisions
at Grinnell. So. What should we doabout
it?

In the past. students haV rallied
together in “crisis" situations, e.g.. the
tenure decision ol a ravorite protessor,
implementation of a core-curriculum
becoming a toosreal possibility. Butdo
such sporadic demonstrations oi our in-
terest really address the problem at its
rants?

i think not. Perhaps i am naive or
hopelessly optimistic. hut l believe that
the current Situation 7 0i student 0in
nion having little impact on decisions at
Grinnell must be addressed by first
creating a formal means of com-
munication. one which is as Old as
Sophocles 7 the Forum. And such a
forum is being Created for the first
time, ’

Mortar Board is sponsoring a series
01 discussions between faculty commits
tees and the student body, I have no ex~
pectation that these will miraculously
alter ANY decisions made at Grinnell
7 not in one hour. But I do strongly
believe (i haven’t worked this hard to
put the series together ior nothing) that
such discussions are the right FIRST
STEP on a long road towards change.
it's up to all of us. faculty, administra-
tion. and students alike. to agree that
the goal of bettering mmunicatioii
between these “factions" is a good one.
and then to seriously work together
towards this goal.

At the SECond discussion in the serles
will be members of the single-most
poweriul decision-making body on cam»
pus ~ the Executive Council. President
Drake. Dean Frazer. Chair at the
Faculty Mr. Duke. Ms. Atwell. and Mr.
Meyer will sit on the panel. The Ex-
ecutive Council is responsible for all
hiring. promotion and tenure deci-
slons."l‘hey are responsible lur alt'lr-
mative action in hiring. Student evaluas
tions of the professors are considered
[or not) by this Council. The Executive
Council has oversight of the cur»
riculum. has a hand in admissions. the
college budget; the list is long tand is in
the Faculty Handbook. incidentally).

Sn , . . come on and take part in a nevi
Grinnell tradition! Seniors — leave a
legacy of action for the underclasspeor
ple; ireshpeople. come hear what Grln~
nell politics are all about! Come
prepared with YOUR questions,

Am) Fraenkel

The panel discussion with the Ex-
ecutive council will he held on Thurs»
day. March 7th. at :io p.in. in South
Lounge.
