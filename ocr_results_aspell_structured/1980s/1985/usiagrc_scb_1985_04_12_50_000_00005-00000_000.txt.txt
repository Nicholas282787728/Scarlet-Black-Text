i Questionaire on-Peace and Security

How Do You‘Define the Pro-

blem:
Please read all answers;
then check those you agree
with; then go back and cir-
cle the one that best
speaks your mind - or for-
mulate your own state»
ment.

1) Where We Are:

Threatened by the end of
life on earth.

About to see the death of
free institutions as totalitarian
governmental forms extend
their power.

About where we’ve
always been: in jeopardy.
Many more people would die in
a war, but our fundamental
condition, knowing the terrible
cost of refusing to fight and not
knowing what action can best
prevent war, remains.
_Living in a world painful-
ly reaching for enough political
community, across national
boundaries, to make possible
the nonvviolent resolution of in-
ternational conflict.

Other:

2) How We Got There:

We‘ve always been there.
It is in the nature of things.

The same way Faust did.

Nobody in charge: a rud—
derless world.

American weakness. Our

failure to face up to Soviet
power.
# devil theory of the
Soviet Union. Our commitment
to a massive arms race.
vNo overall strategy for
leading us out of the present
threat, much less one that is
pursued persistently by our
government with broad-based
support from the American
people. .

Other:

Goals

1) “Peace” has been defined as the
absence of war; as a world in which
cooperation and harmony have
’replaced conflict and competition;
as a world of freedom, justice and
equality; as a spiritual state within
the individual. It has been defined
as "the fruition of justice"; “the
tranquillity of order" ..... preace is
one of your primary goals, how do
you define it?

Underline the answer that best
speaks you mind —' or write you
own definition here.

2) National Security — Priority
should now be given to:

Sufficient military power
to deter attack and balance
Soviet power in presently
threatened arenas.
Jrogress on arms control
and arms reduction.

Fundamental change in
Soviet policy.

A US turn away from

further extensions of the arms
race.
_Progress toward bi-
lateral arrangement and world
institutions capable of resolv—
ing international conflict
without violence

Comment:

3} Ending War:

Ending war will require
fundamental changes in human
nature; we must work for a
world of harmony and justice in
which the conflicts and tensions
that can lead to war have been
eliminated

Ending war is an im-
possible goal; it is naive and
uptopian to expect it to be taken.

seriously in the formulation

and conduct of foreign policy.
The goal of ending war
can be made credible and feasi-

ble if it focuses not on transfor—
ming the human psyche or
eliminating conflict, but in-
stead on achieving the minimal
conditions essential to the non-
violent resolution of interna-
tional conflict.
7Comment:

Policy Direction for US Peace
and Security Policy

1) Arms:

The United States should
immediately and unilaterally
take steps toward drastic
reduction in its military
establishment and should pur-
sue such a course regardless
of the response of others.
7We should continue to
pursue efforts to achieve
multilateral arms reductions
through negotiations, but we
should *be careful to maintain
the stable balance of power on ,
which world peace depends.

Reductions in our
relative military capability
have already led to a dangerous
situation in which we can no
longer be sure of the adequacy
of our military establishment
before it‘s too late. .

The present situation is
dangerous. Negotiations alone
will not lead us out of it. So-
meone must take the initiative
to create new pressures for
agreement on arms control and
disarmament. The U.S. should
take unilateral steps which of-
fer the,best chance of securing
reciprocal action by other na-
tions, thus moving us toward
the international agreement
needed.
