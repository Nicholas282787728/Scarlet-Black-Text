Aerobics may be her forte. but Jane Fo‘nr
da’s perlormance in Cat Ballou provesher
talent as an actress with a bent [or coin-
edy. Although cat Ballou, by tar was not
Fonda's best work. her performance in
this comedy»western makes the lllm quite
compelling. ’- -
The story is set in the wild west of ear]
America and features all the cliches '0l' 3
goad“B" Western; Bad guys in black. "’
juns." stagecoach robberies and train
heists. The story line may be predictable.
but that campy quality is inherent to the
success at the film. Without a plot that i’el
quired Fonda to “save the iamily ranch
from the clutches of an evil villain.” the
movie would no longer be the parody that
it is. ’ ‘
Cat. portrayed by Fonda. is a likeable
leading lady who is translormed Irom’a
shy school girl to a tough, gunrhandlilig
woman. The cast is turther enhanced 'by
Lee Marvin. Marvin won an Academy
Award [or his excellent portrayal as her
often-drunk sidekick. ' '
Cat Ballou is a classic comedy that real-
ly should not be missed. The entertaining
script, B movie cliches and other campy
qualities make it an optimal alternative to
diligent studying.
