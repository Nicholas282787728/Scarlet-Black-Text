Cutting through the propaganda to
solve the Palestinian problem

Good intentions mixed with ignorance
made a deadly combination. This point
was driven home Lo me by an editorial
read on KDIC's Saturday morning news
show the week before break. The editorial
dismissed PLO terrorism as merely symp~
tomatic of a much larger problem,
"Namely the injustice of the present situa-
tion in the Middle East."

The “injustice”
editorial perceived was that “The Palestir
nian‘people were thrown outof their native
land by Jewish settlers in the 1940's . . .
And some Palestinians have chosen to use
violence to fight the Israeli
encroachment.” This statement simply
has no basis in fact. The speakers
misconception of the situation in the Mid»
dle East led him to mistake the victims for
the villains. labeling the Jews as the an
Lagonists.

The Soviets use the same method of role
reversal as a tactic to mark the Jews as
Nazi Collaborators and to persecute them.
l'm sure the student who wrote the KDIC
editorial did not realize Hie implications of
his rhetoric. so I would like to explain them
here

The Palestinians. far from being evicted
by the Jews. were actually attracted to the
Jewish cities founded in the late 19th cen-
tury In 1862 Mark Twain called Palestine
a "hopeless. dreary. heartbroken land."
Then, the Jews began to immigrate to
Israel. escaping Arab and European
pcrsccution. Niiity percent of thc land the
Jews bought and settled on was un-
cultivated. and the small Arab population
there had remained stagnant for hundreds
of years.

Suddenly. as Jewish towns developed.
bringing jobs and prosperity. the Arab
population flocked to Palestine. Between
1893 and 1947 the number of Arabs in
Palestine Jumped from 483.000 to 746.900.
The figures are even more illuminating for
the period of the Palestine Mandate (the
Mandate granted the Jews a homeland in
7% of Britishowned Palestine)’ from 1920
to 1939 the Arab population rose in Jaffar

A commission from England found in
1937 that “the increase in Arab population
is most marked in areas affected by
Jewish development . . large import of
Jewish capital into Palestine has had a
general fructifying effect on the economic
life of the whole country . , . The expansion
of Arab industry and culture has been
largely financed by the capital thus obtain»

is therefore not surprising that the literacy
rate has gone from 5% in 1948 to 95% to-
day). Perhaps the United States should
follow Israel's example of egalitarianism
by offering Spanishspeaking students in
public schools the choice of studying in
their native language. or even by simply
providing bilingual instruction.

Israel's treatment of her Arab Citizens is
a far cry from the treatment of Jews in
Arab lands. In Syria. for example. Jews
are Subject to barbaric disabilities and
economic restrictions. forbidden to leave
the country and not even allowed to move
more than three kilometers from their
homes without a special permit, Similar
conditions are imposed upon Jews
throughout Hie Arab world. and as a result
over 800.000 Jews have emigrated from
Arab countries to Israel since 1948; sadly.
30.000 have not escaped.

The next untruth which was told was
that “Israelis live and prosper on land
once owned by Palestinians.” The land the
Jews bought in Palestine had been owned
by the Ottoman Turks. who mercilessly
taxed and .terrorized their subjects in
Palestine. The Palestinians (some of
whom were Jewst never ruled themselves.
and in fact the name “Palestine," or
“Philistina.” was given the land by the
Romans in an effort to eradicate “stiff
necked" Jewish resistance to conquest by
the Roman Empire

Yet another misnomer propagated by
the editorial was that “Today. most
Palestinians are either refugees or are llV-
ing under Israeli military rule." The truth
is that 70% of Jordan is made up of Palestir
mans. representing a far greater percenr
tage of the Palestinian people than are llV:
ing in exile. or on the West Bank. And why
shouldn't Jordan house most of the Palesti»
nian population? Jordan occupies 72% of
what was once Palestine. If the Palesti~
nians want a homeland. perhaps they
should regain control of Jordan. in which
they comprise the overwhelming majority
ol the citizenry. and which covers most of
Palestine. anyway

The refugees do. indeed. have a serious
problem, Yet, they are not homeless as a
result of “Israeli encroachment.” but
rather they were created by Israel's
belligerent Arab neighbors in the 1960's as
a weapon with which to crush Israel. These
refugees are Arabs who have been denied
citizenship in every Arab country. even
though many of them only lived in
Palestine [or several generations or less.
In Black September. 1970. 12.000 PLO
members were killed in Jordan. the only
Arab country which had originally ac»
cepted Palestinian reiugees. and the rest
were expelled. In the last 5 months, 4.000
Palestinians have been slaughtered by
Shiite Moslems in Lebanon.

These refugees deserve a home. and
there is much room for them in their 72%
of Palestine. But the noanalestinian rul-
ing class in’ Jordan. headed by King Hus-
sein. will not accept the PLO for fear that
the Palestinian majority will take control
of the country. Therefore. the PLD’s funcv
tion is not to bring the Palestinians home.
it is to destroy the Jewish state.

Finally. I would like to question the
thoroughness of the research which went
into the KDIC editorial The author admits
ted that. in the recent Achille Lauro inci-
dent. “The Palestinians were wrong to hi-
jack a ship and kill one American." But.
then he qualified that statement by noting
that Israel had also used violence in bomb-
ing the PLO headquarters in Tunisia. The
spea ker did not. however. mention that the
Israeli raid was in retaliation for the
murders of sixteen civilians this year (the
PLO has never attacked a military
iargetl.

Apparently that student did not realize
that 1985 has seen the highest number of
PLO killings of Israeli Citizens since 1979.
or else he might not have said accusingly.
"And yet. the reaction of the United States
government. if not to condone the attack.
was that it could understand Israel's
reasons . . ” Hopefully now he, too. can
bcgin to understand Israel's reasons for
defending herseli against PLO terrorism.
