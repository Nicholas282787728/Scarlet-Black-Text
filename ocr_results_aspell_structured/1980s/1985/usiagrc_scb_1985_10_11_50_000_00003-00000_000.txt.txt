Sophomores Chun Esther Yang. DI Des
Plaines. Illinois and Nathan Schmiechen
OI Elmhurst. Illinois were recently ac.
copied to Rush Medical College. upon
graduation from Grinncll.

In coordination with Rush Medical Cole
lege of Illinois. Grinnell is in its second
year of a special program that allows
freshman residents of lilinois to apply to
Rush for early acceptance. .

This program is unrelated to Grinnell's
former joint program with Rush.
Previously. students accepted to Rush acV
lually took their first year of medical
school at Grinnell from a start employed
by Grinnell. These students. however.
were not accepted early to Rush.

Commenting on the program. Prolessor
oi Biology. irving Fishman. noted that
most students enjoyed going to Grinnell
[or their ﬁrst year in medical school\
because of the good studentrl'aculty ratio
and it was also a little “tougher" on them.
The main disadvantage Ioi’ the students
was psychological in that they did not
assimilate to the surroundings of a real
medical school until their second year oi
medical school. Eventually. costs forced
the dissolution oi the program. .

The current program stipulates that on-
ly Grinnell students from Illinois can app-
ly. because Illinois mandates that not
more than twenty percent of the students
at the college can be non-state residents in
o‘r'der to receive its entire subSidy. Rush
must adhere to its admissions policy since
it greatly depends on the state's financial
assistance.

Fishman “doesn’t like to see that [ad.
missions policy] as a restriction." but he
realizes the practicality in having such a
restriction.

The justification ior the early admitr
tance policy is to allow students to receive
a well rounded liberal arts education.
Fishman stated that this justiﬁcation real-
ly "won‘t make an aw[ul lot of difference"
here at Grinnell since the justification
merciy underscores the purpose oi an
education at Grinnell.

~The program is also designed. according
to Fishman to “eliminate the competitive
psychology” normally tell by ambitious
preemed students. The incrcased pressure
that ore-med students may acquire in their
upper class years will not exist. thereby

cnro- arc guidelines for equal employment

cliccs and other stipulations concern
ing South Alrican Black workers

relieving students accepted to Rush of
stress and lenseness

Fishman is currently “ambivalent"
about the program because some students
might leel compelled to attend Rush once
tlicy are accepted. He noted that approxe
iinately tour or five times the number of
entering ireshman aspire to go to medical
school than actually go. He feels for this
reason that one year may be too early to
decide. However. since the first freshmen
were accepted just last year. no data exist
to reveal what kind oi an attrition. rate
there will he.

The program is also coordinated with
Knox College. of lilinois in the iuture. it
may expand to more colleges in the A c M.
