Is this the best the United States can do?

For a person in my position, Wednes
day night's debate on the issue of U.S.
Investment in South Africa was rather
disheartening.

For starters, let me describe my posi-
tion. I consider myself to be a Fan-
Africanist which means that I favor
selfdetermination and cooperation for
and among all Alricans in all
hemispheres of the world.

From this PanrAfricarl perspective
then. the only solution I see to the pro-
blem of apartheid is for Africans to
make a collective push to dump the
system off the end of the continent. into
the sea and to make in its place a
system in which Airicans and hour
Africans alike could decide for
themselves who they are and explore
that decision. it seems quite unlikely
that this will occur in the near future.

But instead of offering any alter-
native solutions to the problem, both
Sides in the debate presented weak
arguments concerned with the type of
influence the United States can have on
South Airica without jeopardizing its
own skin,

One side argued for. lacking a better
term on my part. inﬂuential investment
in the BSA in order to pressure the
Alrikaners into reform by holding up
“the glowing example of American
business management. in other words.
this debater hoped, that by showing the
Afrikaners the best way to turn a profit,
the U.S. firms could provided model for
institutional reforms which the
Afrikaners might follow.

The other side argued for full divest»

, ment from the BSA in order to weaken

the government's economic support
system thus paving the way tor a quick,
though we're sorry for you guys, bloody
revolution. which this particular side
saw as inevitable and one which must
be fought by Black people.

First. to address this second positionv
why should Africans who lend their sup-
port to apartheid by default on the fact
that they are hungry and excluded from
the best farmland. fight the battle while
Americans and Europeans, who sup-
port the system through economic
discourse, sit at home and watch televi-
sion? .
lrecognize that the proponents of this
approach hope to speed the coming of
self determination as the final victory
for the Africans and not necessarily the
violent revolution implied in the pro
cess. But, why don’t they also propose
and more lully explore other methods
of pressure and intimidation whlch
coupled with divestment might bring

the Victory about without a violent
bloodbath: a bloodbath they would not
take part in,

As for the first position. my disdain
for a policy of “influential investment.”
arises from the fact that it condemns
Black Africans to a slow. physical and
cultural death as opposed to the quick
one guaranteed uiem by abandonment
through simple divestment, Not only
will Africans continue to be shot down
in the street, but any hopes at their con-
tributing to the wonderiul thing called
humanity will be shot down with them.

The reasoning behind trying to set an
example for the Afrikaners through the
actions of American firms, to me,
seems like the reasoning that would be
behind a Russian corporation coming to
the US, Where vodka production costs
might be lower, to open a communist
style plant in hopes of pressuring the

U.S. Congress into abolishing the

United States Constitution. If this ac-
tion were the only action taken on the
part of the Soviets, it would only make a
joke ol their policy. end the Cold War
and condemn the people ot America to
perpetual and infinite capitalist ex-
ploitation with no hope of salvation.

Enough hypothetical instance.

The very presentation of an argu-
ment favoring ”influential investment”
in SA allows us to examine one of the
harsh realities of American foreign
policy concerning human rights and
economic interests. Let us compare the
American attitude towards the com-
munist presence in Latin America and
this country‘s attitude towards the
apartheid presence in Africa.

One of the defenses we hear for the
CIA's not»so covert support of antic
communist military action in Latin
America is that the leader of the
western world is concerned about
human rights violationswommitted by
the communist and this is only one oi
the many fronts where the ideology
which allows such an autrocity must be
confronted.

For some reason. this same CIA (for
all I know) is not supporting the
military agitation against the violators

on Africa’s southern tip. And if the Sana
olinislas are dreadful expansionists, so
are the Afrikaners who are illegally in
Namibia and Angola.

Yet the CIA aids the Contras but not
the Airican National Congress.

I can fathom only two explanations
for this discrepancy: either the
Airikaners are not violating human
righm because the Africans are not
humans; or this Administration has

”looked at both situations and determin-

ed that while both systems, com-
munism and apartheid, have
perpetrated gross abuses of human
rights. only the communist system
threatens to channel precise resources
away lrom the Western capitalist
markets, therefore the U.S. govern-
ment will only offer the communists
any serious military opposition.

We also see that this administration
is willing to Spread anti-
communist/pro-capitalistic propagan-
da in Latin America but it is not willing
to do anything near the same thing in
the RSA, denouncing the Apartheid
system, in writing tor all the South
Africans to read. Why not? I would
speculate that it is because popular
support in this country or in Africa is
not necessary for the United States and
the business firms it represents to ‘
carry out their task ot making money.

Regardless of all the rhetoric we do
hear. Americans don’t vacation in
South Africa, students don't go there for
med school, and there is little, if any
cultural exchange between the counr
tries.

The American interest is business
and the American embassies in South
Africa, Marine guards and all, are
there to protect that interest not to pro-
mote human rights or virtues.

True to the Liberal Arts form. neither
side explored concrete options such as
aiding the ANC, placing import bans on
South African Goods. refusing to export
goods to South Airica,relusing to admit
white South African students to US.

ding organizations.

As an African I do have a special in-
terest in the death grip Apartheid holds
on the entire continent but even more as
an African here in America (Afror
American), I have the special interest
of wanting to be proud ol both parts of
my heritage and disappointed with
neither. But if what I heard last
Wednesday is the best' America has to
offer. then myself and Africa, are in a
sad posrtion indeedi
