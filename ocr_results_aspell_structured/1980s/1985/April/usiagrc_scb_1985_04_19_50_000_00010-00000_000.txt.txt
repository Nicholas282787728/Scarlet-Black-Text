The appalling thing about being a
member of our generation is that it puts
one into the category of “child of the
seventies". Having gone from ages five
to fifteen in the decade, i suppose
there's no other decade which I Can
claim for my childhood. Unfortunate-
ly, it‘s a decade in which very little haps
pened.

Robert Klein. the comedian and actor
who named his first album “Child of the
Fifties", makes his decade sound
rather more interesting then ours. They

Joyce Maynard's book on growing up in
the sixties made that sound pretty in-
teresting. too After all, then, all sorts
of people were becoming liberated,
everyone was wearing new hairstyles.

The American Dream

Last Tuesday while attending my iris
ternshlp at the Des Moines Hispanic
Ministry, my boss related to me a short
story. A young single Mexican woman
arrived recently with her two young
children, She came from Chicago. Like
so many immigrants, she arrived with
little more than a desire to [ind a place
to stay, a job, and begin to settle herself
and her small family.

Today she has a steady job and, like
her children. she is healthy. But she
can't afford the rent Charged for an
apartment, So she continues to live my
shelters such as the Catholic Worker
House, and meanwhile. continues her
bout with poverty,

If this sounds like a difficult, yet op-
timistic or hopeful tale. that is because
it is. Sort of, In fact, she will probaby
make it, and so will her children. That
is, provided that nobody falls ill, needs
hospital treatment or schooling. That
is, provided that she doesn't lose her
job, get rohbed, raped, or injured in
some other manner.

But all this aside. the woman will pro
baby make it; she is much stronger
than most Df us, and will survive. From
this point of View her story reminds me
of the great “American" dream. Poor,
and an immigrant. she comes here to
toil and struggle and pull herself up by
her bootstraps. Yes? if such is the case,
than the “American" dream is worth

What a profound effect that “Saturday
Night Fever” had on our culture. The
very concepts of black suits and shirts
with white ties, coke spoons hung from
chains around the neck, jumpsuits,
designer jeans and possibly even lip
gloss emanated for this landmark in
human history. not to mention pattern
dances which took hours but not part

by buttons and other decorations with
smiley faces on them.
