Ice "at"! - Il'l lull

By Kathy Memory

The Vikings, Grinnell‘s ice hockey club,
is now known as the Grinnell Nighthawks,
and they have a real league and a lull
schedule. In past years, Grinnell’s ice
hockey club has played against only one
Des Moines men’s league team at a rink in
Des Moines. The team's schedule cons
sistently consisted oi only about three
games.

1985 will be the first year for the Midwest
Collegiate Hockey Association. an
organization of two divisions and ten
teams originally contrived at the Universi-
ty of Iowa. Grinnell will play in the
Southern league against Loras, Cornell,
the University of Iowa’s “B” teamuand
Galesburg (Knox) in a twelve game
season that begins November 9th.

“It should be interesting to see how we
react to real competition," commented
player Dave “Red” Robertson.

League games will be at rinks in
Waterloo, Dubuque and Peoria, but
strangely enough, never on our. own in-
famous Barber Skating Plaza. Even if the
large concrete patio between Burling
Library and the Fine Arts Building could
he iced over, explains Rowe, it still isn’t
big enough to play hockey.

Money lor the team's renovation was a
problem at first. The rink itself costs $100
per hour of play. with this in mind‘ the
school agreed to increase the club's funds
to $400 from the usual sum of $200. An in
crease in membership dues ($300), and
alumni contributions of $500 raised with
the help of the Development Ofﬁce will
help pay lor more oi'tiie team's essential
expenses, like transportation, relerees,
and the rink, ‘

The luxuries oi hockey, however, items
like practices, goalie equipment. and
pucks. Will have to wait until Rowe alld his
Co-horts Steve Nash and Dave Lillienstein
can find some more money.

Rowe said that seven of last year’s
players will be returning the named ninel,
but the team could use some additional
ones, Some sort ol organizational meeting
will be held in the near future.

interest in a grueling threeevent enr
durance test known as the triathalon has
extended to Iowa. Even some Grinnell
students have caught the fever for this new
sport. including seniors Mary Jane Conse
tant and Rob Rollins. and Junior Jennifer
Bishop. all oi whom participated in
tEiathalons over the summer.

In America. triathalons can range in
length from a “Marathon" consisting of a
two»and-one-hall milepcean swim. lolows
ed by a 112 cycle ride. and a twenty-mile
run to a “Spring" at only 500 yards in the
.water, 10 miles by bike and 4 miles on foot.

Constant has participated in a variety ol
triaihalons, In New York City, she placed
ninth among women and litth in her age
group at of also total participants. At the
Whaletown Triathalon ln Anita, Iowa, she
placed second in her age group. Because
she placed in the top ten of the women's
field, she qualified for the Short-Course
National Championship. ,

Rollins and Bishop were among the 150
people who assembled at the Rock Creek
Short-Course Triathalon here in Iowa
They placed eighth and second in their age
groups respectively.

This relatively new sport which Coms
bines swimming. running and cycling was
deemed "fun” by all three students.
However. Constant. elaborated, “l
wouldn’t recommend the triathalon to
anyone.” All three athletes trained for the
event. Constant rode twenty-live miles a
day in addition to walking. surling, runnr
ing on sand, and swimming in the ocean,
Similarly, Bishop ran six miles a day and
then cycled and swam three times a week.

Rollins on the other hand. claims not to
hate trained too hard — by his own admis-
slon probably not enough. “I'm a swim-
mer. so I was second or third out of the
water." Rollins recalled. “but the other
events . . . I knew I was in trouble when I
was the only one there whose bike had a
kickstand. And then during the run. this
[il'tyrfive year old lady runs past me . . . i
think I'm going to train a little harder this
year." All three athletes plan to para
ticipate in triathalons again this coming
summer.

Although the triathalon might seem
masochistic to the uninitiated, perhaps.
Constant best summed up its appeal: ”it’s
like climbing a mountain It’s more like an
adventure than a competition."
