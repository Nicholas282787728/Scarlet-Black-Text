Women’s B-ball

wins ﬁnal game

By Eric E. Whitaker

The Women’s Basketball team beat
Clarke College 71-58 last Tuesday in
their final game of the season. Ironicalr
ly. Clarke beat crinnell by the identical
scare in their last meeting.

The game was a showcase |or the
brilliant offensive talents of Yvonne
Stroud who tallied 36 points (18/201rom
the ireethrow line). a new school
record, She broke the record that Deb
Eastman set earlier this year with 31
points. .

Seniors Lynette lakes and Val
Mauck, both starters tor the game.
wrapped up their careers last Tuesday.
Though the two seniors will not return.
the team should be strong next year.

According to Coach Fairchild. the
team is young and will be more ex»
perienced next year and thus more
competitive in the league.

The Women‘s team ﬁnished the
season with an overall record of 1042,
and a Conlerence record of 476. With
another year of experience. the outlook
for nextyear’s team cannotbe anything
out brighter.
