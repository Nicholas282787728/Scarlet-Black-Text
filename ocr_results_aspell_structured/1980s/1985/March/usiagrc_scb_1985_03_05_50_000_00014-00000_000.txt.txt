Berke Breathed brings
“Bloom County” to Powesheik County

By Kate Worster

Bloom County creator Berke Breath
ed, packed Roberts Theatre last Friday
with slide show and discussion. Breath-
ed‘ began with several oi his own car.
toon slides put to music and then Hal‘s
rated a briel history of cartooning, in
cluding slides oi “Pogo," “L'il Abner”
and “Prince Valiant.”

The slides were iollowed by an open
discussion with the audience Grimell
was one of the more enthusiastic and
“liberal” audiences he has periormed
to Breathed said.

Breathed talked about his characters
While he set up [or the tworhour presen~
Cation. The “Bloom County" characters
are original to the strip with the excepr
lion oi Steve Dallas and Cutter John
who- appeared in “The Academia
Waltz” Breatlled's strip at the Univer-
sity oi Texas.

.Breathed said that the Characters’
personalities were not modeled after
anyone in particular but are composed
of different parts of himself. The
physical characteristics for some of the
characters. such as Blnklw, the kid
with,“closet" anxieties and Mllo, the
editoroi the bloom County newspaper.
were taken trom old yearbook photos
which were shown in the slide presenta-
tion.

ODUSI is his favorite character
because, “He‘s the most maleable. he’s
the most enjoyable to draw. he tits well
into the frame,” Breathed said.

A penguin was chosen as a character
because Breathed thought there were
tno'many dogs and cats already in com-
ic strips. After visiting the San Diego
Zoo, Breathed realized how much peo-

ple like penguins because they look and
walk like i'unny humans.

The least enioyaole character lor
Breathed to draw is Cutter John. the
Vietnam vet, because the wheelchair

i doesn't lit well into the box, Breathed
said the ease of putting the Character in
a irame makes a diiierence in how
olten the character appears in the strip.

Breathed commented. "Trudeau
tcreater ol ”Doonesbul‘yl" obviously
had a great inlluence when I was at
school . . . probably because I hadn't
been a reader oi comic strips betol'e."

Breathed said he fell into the business
by mistake and that he probably
wouldn’t ’ even read his own strip.
Breathed said he was inlluenced more
by visual styles or other cartoonists. in
particular, Walt Disney,

comes irom Breathed's childhood
desire to live in a small town. A native
oi Los Aiigeles. Breathed learned about
rural liie irom books such as Ray Brad-
bury‘s “Dandelion lime" and “To Klll
a Mockingbird."

“Late Night With David Letterman"
tans will be' disappointed because
although he likes the show. Breathed is
staying “ten miles away lrorn David
Letterman."

“Either you‘re a perlormer or you're
someone he’s [Letterman] going to
make tun oi." Breathed said.

Breathed leels that the cartoons don't
come across over the television and
should be read either in private or show
by slide on a large screen.

Breathed stayed alter the show to
sign autographs ior anyone who asked
and even drew an Opus lor someone. He
later made a briei appearance at the
pub belore returning home to lowa Cir
ty.
