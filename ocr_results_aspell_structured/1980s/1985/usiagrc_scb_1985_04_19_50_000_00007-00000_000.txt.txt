the immigrant issue presented by Cone
ner. First, he said, the number of im»
migrants entering the U.S. each year is
not alarming, as Conner suggested. Se-
cond. the environmental problems Con-
ner mentioned have no logical conner
lion with immigration. Third. absorbr
tion of immigrants into the culture and
into the workforce is not as hard as
some people think. according to
Fallows.

Fallows stated that immigration is
important to the “economic maturity”

workers competing with immigrants.
Fallows revealed a third alternative of
“moving up" Here. the incentive to ad

immigrants in the workforce, Thus,
