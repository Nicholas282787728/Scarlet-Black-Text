funds for

siege food

In it's last official meeting of the
year. Joint Board approved recommen-
dations from the Political Action Sup»
port Fund committee (PASF), to give
$300 w the Black Library in Burling and
to set aside $l0 for load in the case that
students occupy Nollen House in
response to a trustee's rejection of
SEA‘S partial divestment proposal.

Both measures met with some opposi-
tion. Some members questioned
whethenSGA should give funds to the
Black Library given that the library is
talready supported by the administra-
ion.

Representatives who disapproved of
the allocation for food thought the
measure was too antagonistic to the
trustees' position and might hinder
SEA in their negotiations with the
board.

language is being created this tall but
