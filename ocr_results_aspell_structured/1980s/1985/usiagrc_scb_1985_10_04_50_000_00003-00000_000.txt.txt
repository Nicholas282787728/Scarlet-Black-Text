The lil'lll metamorphosis

The old grill.

by David Devouiig

The Forum Grill is one of the most
popular spots to “hang out” on the Grin-
nell College campus, During those seem-
ingly endless hours when the Pub is not
open. the Grill is the place for students to
soctalize with other students on neutral
territory, Of course. the Grill being the
popular and traditional social spot that it
is. major alterations in its decor and fuller
tional operation are going to spur discus-
sion. People objecting to the changes, and
lacking the information as to why they
were made, are apt to contrive the worst
reasons possible.

Solne oi the answers to the questions
concerning the Forum Grill's renovation
that have been circulating around campus
are as follows: The Forum people don’t
want us students hanging out in the Grill
all day so they tried to make us leave by
making the seats uncomfortable, A varia-
tion on this theme has been: in order.t0
make more money. Dave McConnell has;
started to use thc McDonald's approach to
fast food. that is. make the customers feel
uneoniiortable in the mom and they won't
stay as long. and higher turnover means
higher profits, Still another rumor tloating
around, is that McConnell has taken over
the iorinerly student run coiteehouse in
hopes oi lining his pockets with still more
money. This article. I hope. Wltl set the
record straight on some oi these
misconceptions.

The Forum Grill has changed a lot.
That's obvious But looking into ivhy these
changes were lnade makes it clear that
there are practical reasons behind them.
there was no ill-intent on the part of either
the Forum staff or McConnell who
operates the Grill in conjunction with Food
Service. According to McConnell. the en»
tire project was initiated because the
equipment in the old Grill's kitchen area
was Worn out.

The equipment that was used until last
year had been in use for twenty years. Its
time had come and passed. They purchase
ed the new equipment because it alloWed
the Grill to offer a different mix of pro
ducts. and at the same time. make opera-
tion of the kitchen simpler. said MCCOn-
nell,

According to McConnell, the deli case
was installed, because deli~sandwichcs are
the current trend. He looked at what was
being oiicred in town. competition-wise.
and decided to offer the same sorts of
sandWiches at the Grill Even better. the
Grill's deli-sandwiches do not come In we.
determined Sizes.

Other new comestihle goodies which the
Grill otters include gourmet candies. and
tor those interested in health-type iood.

there are also various types or nuts. Mc-
Connell said that he is still experimenting
\V|tl"l new products to determine what
students like and What they do not like.

The new soda machine allows the cane
nisters of soft drinks to remain in the
Forum basement. making it unnecessary
to lug them upstairs as was done last year
There are now ireezer drawers located by
the grill which makes it a little easier to
prepare fried ioods

The counter itseli is new. As opposed to
tllc old counter, a big black monstrosity
which seemed to take up an entire side of
the room. the new counter is much less
menacing. The new counter is also not as
ooniiiiing. The walls being lower the
\\0| keis no longer complain oi reeling him
ed in

in general, Grill employees. reactions to
the new Grill have been favorable Some of
the full time employees said that it is
casicr to prepare iood than it used to be
because the deli sandwiches. a lrcqucnt
ordcr. don‘t take as long to make as ham-
burgers. Although it wasn't a major coni-
plaint. some Grill employees who worked
Ell the Grill last year said that because of
some of the new Grill features. the water
stand. and the uaiidyrcounter, it takes
longer to clean up at closing time

On to the furniture question Where did
all the cushions go‘l Well the old Fyum
booths which were so coiniy wer also
quite old and about ready to tail apart due
to years of heavy use. According to Jenny
Erickson, Forum Director, the booths
were as old as the Forum itself. which

[celebrated Its twentieth birthday last Spr-

ing. Erickson said that to continue to
replace the ripped vinyl cushions would be
costly. and that to rebuild the entire booths
would be costly as well

According to Erickson. the selection or
new booths was made to iuliill two
criteria: tine. aesthetic value. The oak
irames oi the new booths are'an attempt to
match the oak in the ceiling. And two.
because or heavy use. maintenance or un-
cushioned booths would be easier.
Erickson said that the rumor which was
circulating at the time that the one
cushioned booths were an attempt to keep
students irom squatting in the Grill all day
was completely uniounded. She said that
she knew that some students would com-
plain about the liardwood seats She even
contemplated getting some cushions which
could be checked out at the Forum desk
lust like the ping-pong paddles and balls,

The iinal question: why did Dave Mce
Coniiell steal the coiiee housc away from
the studentsv The answer to that question
is a Simple one: He didn't. what actually
happened was this' At the end 01 last year.

The new grill.

after Erickson hail advertised for a stue
dent group to run the coriee house this
year. no student group had responded.
There was a possibility that there would be
no Sunday aiternoon coiiee house
anymore

So. this fall. Erickson asked McConnell
if Food Service would be willing to run it to
insure that there would be coffee and
snacks available to students on Sunday
afternoons. McConnell and Food Service
began to operate the coiieehouse. A survey
that McConnell look indicated that at least
halt oi the students surveyed wanted
students to run the coffeehouse again.
Ultimately. a studellt organization.
Amnesty international, came iorward the
next week and offered to run It.

The current status of the coffeehouse, as
one can probably gather by reading an an
iiouiicemeiit in the most recent campus
memo. Is that the coffeehouse is once
again available to any student organiza-
tion which wants to take responsibility for
it. Those interested organizations should
talk to Jenny Erickson in the Forum,

\l'lieli Dave McConnell was asked about
the coffeehouse controvei‘y. he said that lie
was glad to see the students involved in it
once again because it was somewhat oi a
hassle for his staff to-opel'ate He also felt
the coireehouse best served its purpose
when students ran it.

So that s about it. l-lopeiully the record is
now set straight on these issues.

Grillites eomment on the changes:

“The booths are not as comiortable as
the old ones. but I like the ilat areas on the
booths because you can set things on
them " ,

“I don't think it was necessary. but I
guess it looks better," .

“I really hate these tthe booths) because
you can get really antsy on them. You can
never get really comfortable.

"It looks nice. but the benches are un~
comfortable. The only thing that really
bothers me is not having Cushions on the
seats

“The chairs are uncomioriable. It's too
expensive. but the ladies who work behind
the counter are really nice, I Wish there
were a liroplace in here because then it
would be just like a ski lodge."
