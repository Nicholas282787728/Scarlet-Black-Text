Students of English Literature are
lamiliar with Ben Jonson's tale of greed
and manipulation entitled “Volpone.”
which opened last night at Roberts
Theatre.

"Volpone" is a seventeenth century
"comedy" about a wealthy Venetian noble

said that plays are pl‘ d to pel'lorm
because they represent ertain period
or type. This is-a clas a] renaissance

Finally. l\‘ ’ttt said that "Volpone"
represents a "tough challenge" lor the

Volpone is the greediest of them all.

Beck has starred inother theater depart-

ca 5 "Yerma". Mark in “Still Life". and
the Man in “The Man with a Flower in his

has prepared him ior any role. “I want to
pursue acting when I leave Grinnell and
this has really been a great experience ior
me I never thought I could do
Shakespeare. but now I think I could.”

since they were last here. this group has
gained popularity throughout the country.

Beck said that the play is relevant.
despite its language. time. and ltalian set
ting. to what is going on in the world today.
"Volpone's gold and riches have replaced
God and religion in his mind. For some
people. things really haven't changed that
m uch." he said.

Although the play is a comedy. Beck said
“We're really trying to bring a lot oitlic
s 'ious thoughts out. i think the themes
arc more important than the humor." he
said

Beck said that one of the reasons he's en,
joyed acting in “Volponc” is working with
Christopher Taylor “HC is Grinncll's
Marlon Brando.” said Beck. Taylor plays
Mosca tltalian for "fly"t. Volponc's ever
present servant and wily assistant.

Taylor said that Mosca is
"the hardest character I've ever
played.” He said that the play has many
levels. Just as his own character does.
"lilosca can be somber and intellectual
\i hen he is alone with Volpolie. but he can
bu [among and stupid in public These two
levels require totally diiierent physical ac
tions and motivations.” he said ,

Jessica Thebus stars as Celia. one of the
play's iew innocents. who Volpone tempts
With his riches. ,

She agrees with Beck and believes that
the play has a message "He is saying
goodness pays off. but he still shows the ins
sanity of the world." Thebus likens the
play to Shakespearean drama. because “it
IS an art form that changes and evolvest
and Can be something totally new in 20th
century eyes"

Performances oi "Volpone" are
scheduled for Nov. 21. 22. and 23 in Roberts

The amount oi work that goes into a ma
jor theater production like “Volpone” is
staggering

Rehearsals for “Volponc” started on
September so, On the average. Rich Beck.
who plays Volpone, estimates that tor the
iirst iour weeks he spent three to four
hours five days a week in rehearsal.
‘ ‘These past two weeks it's been more like
five to six hours a day. six days a week.”
h e said.

Rehearsal time does not count the time
spent in learning lines and exploring one's
character Chris Taylor. who plays Mosca.
said the time spcnton “figuring outwhat is
going on in the character's mind.
establishing his physical characteristics
and making creative bits and pieces” is
just as important as the rehearsalltime

“I spent break memorizing lines and
I've thought of a lot of things to enhance
Mosca outside of rehearsal.” Taylor said

Beth Albrecht is on the stage crew for
"Volpone" and played Mcg McGrath in the
department's production of “Crimes of the
Heart” last month. She said homework
was squeezed in on the weekends and that
her social life was nonexistent during the
four weeks she was in rehearsal ”We
rehearsed six days a week for about three
hours a day. It was hard and everyone was

‘very tired." she said.

Although smaller roles in plays require
less time for line memorization. rehearsal
is required for everyone, How can a stu-
dent balance the demands on his or her
time? How do student actors stay ailoat
academically?

Beck said that his proicssors have been
"understanding" and that he has iocused
solely on the play since break. “It is imr
possible to carry the role and carry a iull
w orkload and I've done What I can concer-
ning mv schoolwork,” ile expects a busy

Taylor is a theater major and is in
tercsted in acting. playwriting and direc-
ting. "I made a conscious decision when I
came here that the plays would come

"structure that overwhelmingly accen-
luates the academic education " “It seems

Although he believes many proiessors
are fair. Taylor iinds that some don’t see
working on a play as a “legitimate reason
for an extension. I’ve encountered this at
titude a lot at Grinnell ”

In addition to the actors. time demands
are also placed on the support staii 7
those who design and prepare the set and
costumes

Jan Czechowski is stage and lighting
director for ”Volpone” and said that
discussion about the set with the play's
dircctor. Sandy Moilett. started in August.

“From there we moved to informal cons
cept meetings and more discussions and
sketchings." he said.

Czechowski prepared a three
dimensional scale model or the set; and
made working drawmgs from which the
actual stage units could be built. “The
stagecraft class has been really involved
tor the past eight weeks in working on this

. set.”

Technical rehearsals are held before the
performance to make sure everything on
stage _ the lighting. the set cues. and the
sound cues — runs smoothly.

Cindy Abel ‘77. is a professional
seamstress and -the show's costume
designer.

Abel has been working since October‘on
designing the costumes. She is a m7
graduate oi Grinnell College with a major
in sociology.’

“Sandy and Jan determined what period
we Were in and I went from there.” The
costumes are elaborate. and the style oi
the times has been altered to accentuate
the animal imagery in Jonson’s play. For
instance. Volpone. the Fox. is dressed
lrom head to toe in furs, The three Cour-
tiers who are vying ior his inheritance all
have names that mean birds. and they
w ear feathers and very padded chests.

Other characters who receive special at»
tention in being costumed are a trio oi
“fools." These “fools" are servants to
Volpone and they include a dwarf.
eunuch. and an androgynous person. The
costumes for the eunuch and the an-
d rogynous character proved to be the most
technically difficult. Abel explains that
these two costumes are actually split down
the middle. Each costume is half of 3
females costume and half of a male's
costume,
