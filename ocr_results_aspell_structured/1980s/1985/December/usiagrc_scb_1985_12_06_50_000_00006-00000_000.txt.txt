SGA: Ignoring
the student body

Well SGA is up to its old tricks
again. i thought things would be
lditterent when the reterendum
{system was introduced last year,
but it appears that not only is the
lretetendum system not being us-
‘ed, but SGA feels it does not need
to use it — SGA can decide what
the campus wants without con.
lsulting the campus.

I am referring to SGA's recent
decision to institute a Gay
Resource Center. why wasn't I, or
anyone outside at the SGA clique,
asked also'ut the issue? what gives
SGA the right to make an impor-
tant decision like this without
consulting the campus? The only
reason I can think of is that it soA
had put the proposal hetore the

ampus, 56A would have found
ut that a Gay Resource Center is
not what the campus wants. 0r

aylse son is iust plain Iaxy. and
elt the proposal would pass
nyway so why bother taking the
ime to consult the campus.

hat's the referendum system
or. it not tar important decisions
ike this?

I'm not against the idea of hav-
ng a Gay Resource Center, what
others me is the sneaky way SGA

out about deciding that I

anted one. What was the rush all
about. why was .this decision pass-
ed so quickly? It took three weeks
for SGA to decide whether or not

a iudco alternative could serve as
chair of iud-co: the issue of a Gay
Resource Center deserved more
than one week of debate. Can it
he that SGA does not have time to
tind out what the student body
(who elected them) really wants?
And it this is the case. why have a
student government organization
at all? ' ‘

I doubt this is the case. Giving
SGA the benefit of the doubt, I
assume they target or did not
want to use the referendum
system, since it has not been used
all year. And having reminded
SGA that we do indeed have a
reterendum system spe
designed tor situations like this, i
assume that SGA's next move will
he to rectity their gross mistak
by bringing this issue hetare th
campus.

And while I'm on the subied o
resource centers, where is th-
Women's Resource Center? wher-
is the Jewish Resource Center. the
Catholic Resource Center, the
Senior Resource center. the Drug
and Alcohol Abuse Resource
Center. . . .

The matter is clear. more than a
Gay Resource Center is needed,
and the way to get these resource
centers is by consulting the cam-
pus through the referendum
system so the campus, not SGA,
can decide what is needed.

Another ‘angry man"

Well it seems an angry old man has
finally come out and said what has been on
my mind and quite a few other minds as
well. il it is sale to assume that what
comes Irom our mouths is connected with
what goes on in our minds, Lately I‘ve
heard a lot or mouths saying things like
this: “Grinnell College is getting more
conservative." Usually they don't go into
much detail. but now the angry old man
has changed that. Does the majority agree
then. that the present situation really
sucks'7

Fine Who wants to do something about
it? No, don't start reading the Personals
yet, we ought to think about this, Too many
or us have complained loo long to each
other but have done nothing. Why don't we
bring our own beer to the Country
Hoedown or whatever ugly child the col~
lege calls the event. Willi which ll has
replaced Oktoberfest? T00 radicél‘? How
about bringing bur own toad as a gesture of
protest?

While I’m on the subject of beer, whv not
make Relays the sum of a bunch of little
parties when lowa ralses its drinking age7

After all, Relays started out as a party ii, .

but is under age will have a lake ID. two

have to screw around with vouchers and
snow lcnces. is anyone up for a little guer-
rilla thealer on prospective weekends? or
bong hits in irunl oi the forum? Oops! That
would be illegal, wouldn't it? Okay, com.
plctcly disregard that last statement
what about graduation next spring? We
could do something special, like having

George Drake confer an honorary degree

plain silly, right? Did you know that on two
