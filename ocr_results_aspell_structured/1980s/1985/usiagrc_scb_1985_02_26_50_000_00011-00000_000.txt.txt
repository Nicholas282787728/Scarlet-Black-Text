The Tuesday Observer

. An astounding thought came to me last
Friday afternoon in the Forum! 1 was
relaxing with a cup or coiiee when suddenr
1y i was struck by the realization that coi-
I‘ee must have played a trememdous role
E1 die shaping oi history. Why, had the

thiopians never mixed hot water with
those slimy little brown beans live cen-
turies ago, [can’t imagine that civilization
tvould ever have gotten oii its feet

My iurther moughts gave rise to the
great achievers in history: Newton.

eethoven and Tolstoy to name a iew,
Would Newton have rounded Calculus
without that steaming cup or cotiee at his
desk7 Would Beethoven have written his
cum symphony? Would Tolstoy ever have
completed War and Peace? For that mat-
ter. would l ever have iinished this coir
mm?

The next thought that popped into my
mind concerned how these people drank
.lheir coiiee. Did they drink it black? Or
with cream and sugar? or did they drink
,decait But let us leave those questions to
the unemployed historians and move on to
ithe coiiee drinkers oi today.

Today one iinds many varieties oi coi-
‘iee drinkers First there are the novices
tthose yust starting out The
- iilk- shakers " ’iheir recipe is three
Iquarters oi a cup oi milk twenty tables

poons oi sugar and three eyedroppers full
oi coiiee.

There are also the seasoned veterans
who drink their coiice black They're the
type who order a “large" at the Forum or
have two cups on their tray at dinner, And
as a precautionary measure, they carry a
iew beans with them to snack on

Undoubtabiy. there are certain
stereotypes associated with coitee
drinkers. There are the “disheveled"

Andrew Plantinga
Jim Robinson

types. They're the ones who drink straight
out oi the pot, have a cigarette hanging
irom their mouths. and tear at their hair
as they iranticaily struggle to complete
their income tax on the night oi April 14,
One sees a lot oi this variety around
Grinnell at Iinals time. with a large black
coiiee in iront oi them, shirt un-tucked and
unbuttoned. with bloodshot eyes. and
hands trembling. they work iervently to

finish those two twentyri‘ive page papers
put oii until the last night.

At the other end of the scale are the
“French restaurant” types. They're the
ones who sit in a cafe sipping hot coffee.
but ”cafe au lait." Of course their legs are
crossed (at the knee. not the sloppy ioot on
knee p05iti0n) and their conversations
naturally pertain to Intensely intellectual
subjects such as current trends in existen-
tialist thought, the latest production at the
Metropolitan Opera, or the new spring
fashions from Paris One overbearing
their conversation might catch such
phrases as “I really related to the actor
but he was a touch too self-ironic," or “1
think the book reflects the author's pseudo»
significance not the inherent ramificar
tions oi his realism complex."

Then there are the “decafs. ” (I shudder
to think of the word decaffeinated)
“Decafs” deny Coffee‘s intended purpose;
to provide a tasty way to saturate one‘s
system with caiieine. They are not unlike
those who drink hot water instead of tea.

In any case, whatever one's pleasure
may be — whether one drinks to stay
awake, to be sophisticated or simply for
the enjoyment oi the taste , there is no de-
nying that coiiee is an integral part of our
lives. As Mr. David Bowie says. “We are
the coiiee generation.” .

‘Names Among Other Things

Well I think It s time once again to pick
up the search ioraname ior any oi the
I columns which i might write this
semester. I would like. without too much
w digging at Rob. to point out that I had
‘ wanted my last column to be called
"Perspectives," l iigured that having dIi»
, ierent perspectives applies just about
everywhere In our lives, and that my ideas
u came under that category. However. the
name was changed at the last minute

, Personally, l was never a prospective at

didn't like anyway) was confounded by the
fact that Mr. Lopatto's article in the Same

I am reminded of the next issue. when
Eric Fisher tried to be cute by naming his

is certainly not new to history. However. I

The gay rights movement Is seen as
threatening because it challenges a tradi-
tional society which would‘like to deﬁne
women in terms of their sexual relations
with men and vice versa. People should
realize that it Is not homosexuality which
is the problem but this fundamental definir
tion.

I find the punk rock culture fascinating
(looking at it irom the outside at least)
because in its most radical manifestation
it cuts the physical distinction of sex 'to
pieces. Perhaps they reel that androgyny
is the only way to bring about the equality
part of the feminist formula. I don't like
that very much because It threatens the
ireedom aspect.
