Foreign language departments at Grin-
nell are investigating the possibility oi pure
chasing a satellite tracking system which
would track foreign television satellites
and decode their transmissions for view~
ing at Grinnell.

At this point. the primary interest has
come from some Russian department
faculty members whom recently viewed a
tracking system developed at Creighton
University in Omaha. Nebraska. However.
Professor Victor Verrette oi the French
department is also very interested in buy
ing a similar device to receive French
Canadian television transmissions.

The Creighton system was designed by
Father Lee Lubbers, who now is looking
for buyers or his technology. Lubbers'
system is designed to track a Soviet televi-
Slon satellite array known as MOLNIYA.

Faculty and students were able to see a
working model oi the system's main come
poneni, a large receiving dish. last Friday
afternoon beside ARH. Last. spring. Grin-
nell professors went to Creighton tor a
more thorough demonstration,

There is some concern. though. that Lub-
bers' system is not the best one available.
“The system has some problems in
decoding, taping, and putting it on T.v,."
Verrette said, Interested faculty are com-
parison shopping for tracking systems.
and “the Russian department and audio
Visual Want to find the best possible
technology before presenting a proposal to
the college," continued Verrette.

Uses for the tracking system could be
quite varied. including both academic and
entertainment, but some laculty members
seem to have only a vague idea at how it
mlght be used in the-classroom. Professor
John Mohan oi the Russian department
said that. “At first. its use would be extra
curricular 7 and enrichment for students
and staf .”

Mohan believes foreign television news
and children’s programming could be
educationally beneficial. and is also in

terested in Soviet pop shows “that
demonstrate that the Soviet Union is not
the gray and forbidding place wethlnk ofit

s " Though applications are still unclear.
Mohan said that no recommendations will
be made to the college until ”everything is
thought out." '

With any satellite tracking system. there
are numerous technical. practical. and
legal problems. some or which cannot be
worked out and must be worked around,
For example. for good reception the dish
must be as close as possible to the televir
sion monitors. thus the dish must be
located very near. it not on top of. ARI-l.
ARH may not bc able to support its weight.

There are also legal restrictions concer-
ning the taping olshows; and the dish can-
not easily move from tracking one satellite
to tracking another. thus making it
necessary to purchase a dish for every
satellite (and every language) which die
college would like to. monitor. When asked
it a tracking system would still be wor-
thwhile in light of so many hindraHCES.
Verrelte said it would still be “worthwhile
at a small college because students can
have immediate access to what is broad
cast."

The approximate cost or each dish is
322.000 plus installation, When asked if the
educational benefits obtained would be
worth the cost. Mohan responded. “You
can‘t measure the educational productivi»
ty of such learning tools,"

As far as learning a language. foreign
television would not provide anything uni-
que that printed materials. lilms. and pic-
tures could not provide. but Mohan delend-
ed the system by saying that television is
“yet another exposure to the language.
You try to multiply the exposures — that‘s
better psychologically,”

Catherine Frazer. Dean of the Faculty.
is also very interested in the satellite
tracking system. “It would be an added
dimension to language instruction.” said
Frazer.

Frazer indicated that should the college
buy a satellite tracking system. it will
deﬁnitely be a part of a much larger
change in the college's language support
laciiities and physical plant. A satellite
tracking system “will only be bought as
part of a plan to upgrade the entire audio
visual system. and the timing oi any come
mitment to the dish will most likely be
related to the renovation oi ARH,” Frazer

It is hard to write a sports wrap-up in the
spring when the paper’s last edition is
printed before the season has ended.
Usually no one minds not reading about
how badly a team ﬁnished. But when a
team does well. this lack of coverage is a
disadvantage, Therefore, although it is
now September. it is not too late to laud the
efforts of the 1935 Women's Track Team
that won their conlerenee championship
meet last May.

Grinnell brought sev‘eral conference
champions home from the meet at Mon-
mouth: Jennifer Bishop in the lSUOm run
(4257.75). Shavaun Adams in both the
3000m and 501mm runs (11:05.5. 19:23.4),
First place in the 10,000m was Becky Huts
ton 141:“) Veronica Platzer also Won
both other events. throwing the shot 43' 7"
and the discus 134' 8”. a conference
record. A school record was also set by the
second place 4 X 100m relay team of Kim
Kuncl. Chris Lawson, Lisa Meedcn. and

, Becky Rate (52.6)

The Women's Track team last,won the
outdoor title in 1979. They were picked to
wui it last year, but Coach Evelyn
Freeman was not convinced. She was

pleased then. to see that “everyone gave

their best or almost their best perior—
mance” at the conference meet. Tile
women really “pulled together" at the end

said.

According to Frazer. that renovation
should certainly happen within the next six
years. II we ever see a satellite dish at
Grinnell. then. we will see it as part of a
newly renovated ARI-l ,

For over twelve years the Pub has been
a central part of the “Grinnell
Experience.” But because of. a likely
change in Iowa’s drinking age. the Pub
may soon be closing its doors:

During its next season, the Iowa state
legislature will again Con51der a bill that. it
passed. will raise the legal drinking age in
Iowa from 19 to 21 (The grandfather
clause would allow persons born after July
31‘ 1966 to legally drink in Iowa.) The
legislature is feeling pressure from the
lederal government to pass the bill. in July
1984. President Reagan signed a bill
erecting a law that all states must have ii
drlnklng age of 21 by October 1. 1956. or
they will_ lose 5 percent of their road con-
struction allocationﬁiltil September 30,
1987 Alter that, the loss of road construc-
tion allocation will be to percent a year.

Organized groups. such as Mothers
Against Drunk Driving iMADD). are lob-
byillg ioi the passage ol the bill 'lhese
groups hope that a drinking age of 21 will
help to reduce the number of accidents in
