Grinnell turns away qua ed
white candidates in its search for
a black protessor to teach Atro-

tance of retaining black ‘students
and faculty at predominantly
white colleges. It appears that

The resolution signed by the
trustees last May called tor

in South Africa that did not comp-

do not completely ensure equal
treatment of all workers.

There are ways to circumvent
these accords while still presen-

example, some companies that
"follow" the agreement e
mostly whites. These companies
are merely dancing around the
principles of the
Sullivan Accords. And, only 2.200
of the 2.2 million blacks living in
South Africa — less than one per-
cent — are employed by com-
eanies which have signed the
Sullivan Accords. -

lvtr. Eissenbcrg: this is my response to

My response; I have never responded to
a nything written in the Scarlet and Black.
although at times i have been sorely temp

constructed of crystal. is very altractive.

1 know nothing about protesting. have
