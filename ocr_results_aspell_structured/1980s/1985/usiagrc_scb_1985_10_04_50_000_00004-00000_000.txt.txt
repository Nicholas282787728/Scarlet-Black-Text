Mary Chamberlain was a notable Grin.

not graduate from Grinnell until 1392. four
years ailer Mears Cottage was built, and

Do you ever wonder what happened to

come and go on this campus. Students to

nounce that it is continuing its etlorts
toward divestment and working on new
ways to protest Apartheid,

Last year, the trustees oi the college
agreed to a partial divestment on the con»
dition that S.E.A, do the research into
which firms were not in compliance with
the Sullivan Accords and iurther asked
that the students show their commitment
to the cause by starting a scholarship lurid

apologize sincerely.)

S.E,A, has been researching the ﬁrms in

Second, I would like to write about
members at the Young Communist
League As I mentioned before. We had two
opportunities to have meetings with Soviet
youth, They were members oi the Young
Communist League. I have to make some
complaints about these meetings first I
was expecting to exchange various opi-
nions with them first} but the place was
like a discotheque, At the beginning sue
meone gave an official speech whlle music
started to play so loudly that 1 could not
hear anyone's voice. although i wanted to
talk with somebody. Moreover. most oi
them could not speak English. Many of
them were female and they urged me to
dance it I tried to talk to somebody who
understood some English. twas expecting
to talk with them about politics, the rela-
tionship between Japan and the USSR, and
other international problems with great
enthusiasm. yet what could we get it we
met some people who did not speak with
us'!

Nevertheless. I managed to [ind some
Chance to talk with people who could
understand English. Most 01 the girls were

engineers. in the USSR women are suppos-

ed to be equal to men and it seems that the

equality is even more advanced than in the ,

United states. Accordingly the divorce
problem appears to be very serious Xask-
ed some boys if their military service is a
pain. They said with confidence. “Of

course. military service is not tun, but we‘

have to serve because it is our duty, it was
not the United States but the USSR that
won World War II " 1t ls true that what
they sullered during the war is

meetings were-communist members, but
all were candidatesdt'is very difficult to
become ii party member 1 met a party
member among them and aslil a. him about
Sakliarov and pornography, i had a typical
answer trom him: Conclusivcly. it was
good to talk with him frankly, but alter all
they are those who were educated
thoroughly as Soviet representatives, so
these meetings were national adver-
tisements for the government sponsors.
When they told me “You asked a lot of
questions, You are clever.” at the end of
the meeting. 1 suspected that 1 had been
checked in their black list

Unlike them. I had a chance to hear what
Soviet youth really think. This happened at
Kiev, the capital city of the Ukraine
republic. When I had just left a hotel. one
young guy Came to me and asked it I had
anything to trade with him. He wore a
polarshirt. Lee jeans. and Nike tennis
shoes. He wassmiling and seemed good
natured. When I answered. “No." he asked
again, “You are Japanese? where are you

I thought it would be interesting to talk
with him and we went downtown by bus
together. I asked him. “Where did you get
your polo shirt and jeans?“ “I got these
jeans on the street. and this polo shirt and
shoes were sent by my American irlend.”
he said, He was a flrst year student at a
cooking school and learned English by
himseli by reading English books,

We went to a department store tirst, He
said. “Russian goods are all of low quality.
I sent this Russian hat to my American
lrieiid in return." Afterwards we went to a
cale American music was playing there.
We talked about various things. A part of
our conversation was as lollows. “with
such clothes. aren't you stopped by the

"No. it is UK There are many other peo-

“Young people probably do. But 1 don't
