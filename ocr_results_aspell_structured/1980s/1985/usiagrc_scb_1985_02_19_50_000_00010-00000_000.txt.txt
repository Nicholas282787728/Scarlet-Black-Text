Cooper Evans speaks on Ethiopia

by Rebecca Weston

”Each time I’ve come home with more
questions unanswered, and more doubts in
my mind about our policies towards
African countries,” said Cooper Evans.
il’ll'eetel‘m US congressman from Iowa.
Sponsored by Grinnell’s Aid for Ethiopia
Committee. Evans spoke on Wednesday in
Loose Lounge about the current economic
CrISis in Atrica.

Evans. who said he has visited more

areas and spent more time in Atrica than
any other congressman, iirst spoke about
the general problem in Africa. and then
concluded by speaking on Ethiopia,

Although the media is concentrating on
the problems in Ethiopia, Evans sai in
relation to at least seven other countries in
Africa. Ethiopia is less severely hit by
draught and famine. The whole of Africa is
short at least three million tons of mod.
while Ethiopia alone represents one
seventh of that shortage, Evans said,

Furthermore, Evans stressed that it is
“an oversimplllication of the problem if
people think that by treating Ethiopia, we
are treating the continent as a whole."

According to Evans, there are iouriiasic
reasons tor the wide-spread hunger and
malnutrition, The first explanation for the
problems. is the draught that is prevailing
throughout the continent. “The draught is
serious, it is longrterm. Some
metei‘ologists believe that the draught is a
permanent change." Evans said

Over population is also a lactor.
Although there is a change in attitude
among those llVlng in the cities. manv
Africans still consider it advantageous to
have large iamilies to work on the ﬁelds,
Evans said. There is not much hope in
solving problems in Africa on a long~term
basis without first solving the problem of
overpopulation, he said.

Evans also said that political factors are
to blame for the current economic condi»
tions oi Africa. He claimed the socialist
governments presently in power do not
regard agriculture as a high priority. Add-
ed to this, Evans said. many of ﬂiese
governments do not allow lood to be
transported to places where there are
rebels or insurgents Consequently. large
segments of the population do not get
relief.

The crisis. however. is not only one at
food shortages, but also the “tremendous
lengths or the logistical chain.” Evans
said, Ports are small, tchks are broken
down and storage facilities are inader
quate,

Moreover, Evans said that the overall
approach to assisting the continent is
wrong. Not only do we have a tendancy to
rely on large solutions that have quite ire-
quently proven to tell, we are applying
Western technology in an Atrica where it
does not fit, Evans said.

Rain iorests are cut down and crops too
harsh on the iragile soil are planted tar too
otten, Evans commented.

Regarding Ethiopia, Evans said that the
severe draught. a socialist government.
and civil war are responsible for the
economic crisis. Evans also stressed that
the conditions in Ethiopia are quite dltr
{erent from the rest at the continent. in-
stead oi the large rain iorests that are
found in Central Africa, Ethiopia is a land
oi barren plateaus.

Furthermore, Evans emphasized that it
is not only children that are sutlering
“The elderly and women oi childbearing
age, are hit the hardest. Evans said.

Evans emphasized that the United
States and the Soviet Union are working
well together, crediting the USSR with im~
provements made in transportation
lacilitics He also said that the reason the
USSR isn’t providing iood is because they
have very little load to provide.

The long term solution Evans oiiered to
the problem in Ethiopia was to reintroduce
a profit incentive to iood crop iarming.
This incentive. Evans said. needs to go to

the Small farmers. We must “give the ,

farmers reason to put in more eliorl than
is necessary to feed his tamily. A prom In-
centive is essential." he said
