After two serious accidents last year. the
athletic department. in conjunction with
the admi 'stration. has made major
changes in travel policies. These changes
prevent student athletes from driving a
van or any larger vehicle to or from
athletic contests. and drastically reduce
the number of long trips on fall and spring
breaks.

“The accidents, and to a much lesser
degree rising insurance costs, caused the
athletic department to realize the need for
some preventive changes." said John
Pfitsch. Athletic Director.

“Before. drivers were chosen fairly inv
discriminately.” he continued. ”Now stu~
dent athletes will no longer be able to drive
vans. Under some circumstances. We will
still have to use them to drive cars.”

Pfitsch stressed the fact that all of the
coaches have been required to obtain a
chauffeur’s license. Only drivers with a
chauffeur's license will be able to drive the
vans. and the department will hire outside
drivers if needed for long trips,

Another change will be the amount of
time teams will spend on the road. The
teams Will travel no more than nine hours
a day. Although the distances the teams
will travel to away contests won't be
altered. there will be an effort to allow for
more travel time.

Trips on Vacation time are a different
matter. Although not part of the new stan-
dard policy. athletic trips during breaks
will be reduced to about half the present
number.

SGA held a meeting on Wednesday, and
members discussed alcohol at parties and
overcrowding.

Alcoholic beverages served at campus
parties must now remain within the
designated party area. This ruling was
made to reduce property liabilities

Changes in admissions procedures were
discussed as possible solutions to future
overcrowding of dormitories. One such
change involves a waiting list for higll
school seniors.

Critics of the bill feel that the state could
‘get the money for road construction in
other ways, Professor Frank Goodkin, a
member of the Pub board. believesthat
the state could use the revenue made from
the taxes on alcoholic beverages. Goodkin
and another member of the Pub board.
Paul McLachlan. ’86. speculated that the
sum raised in alcoholic beverage taxes
could possibly exceed the amount that
would be withheld by the federal govern-
ment.

The Pub Board maintains that if Iowa's
drinking age is raised to 2i. the Pub would
have to close.

"The reduction of vacation trips won’t
be evident this year because we were
already committed." said Pfitsch. “Next
year is when people will notice the
change "

One spring break trip has already been
affected. however. The entire track team
will no longer go to the Florida relays.
“This year we will be able to take only a
select few 7 those that qualify ~ to
Florida." said William Freeman, men’s
track coach.

One of the two acoldents tllat led to the
changes in travel policy occurred on last
year’s Florida trip, In Missouri. a van
driven by a student missed a turn. flipped.
and rolled resulting in many minor in
juries and one major injury. John
Toomscn. a freshman. was in a coma for
several days after the accident. Coach
Freeman has kept in touch with the
Toomsen family and was able to provide
information on John Toomsen’s progress.

“There are eight stages of recovery
from his type oi injury.” said Freeman.
“and he is somewhere between five and
six. it is a relearning process and that
takes time. He is improving steadily and is
now living at home.”

The other accident occurred last 00
lober when a van driven by Coach Pfitsch
collided with a small pickup truck in
Nebraska. Coach Pfitsch feels he was at
fault. citing iatigue alter a nine hour drive.

The new policy will attempt to ensure
the safety of the athletes on the road. as
well as on the lield.

had to work hard. and they did work
hard " And as conference champions. they
were certainly justly rewarded for their ef-
forts.

Any story on women's track cannot be
considered complete without mention of
the national competition at Dennison Cole

place in a field of 66 teams was made all »

Reflecting on the meet. Ronnie feels that
her performance could have been even
better than it was. At Dennison. she threw

discus. but Coach Evelyn Freeman reports
that Ronnie has oiten bettered those
throws in practice. They both agree that

Looking for a way to put your two cents
in? Last year. the Student Government
Association (SGA) created a referendum
system which allows students to express
views on international. national. state, and
campus issues.

An individual or a group may submit a
preliminary proposal to the Committee on
Student Politics lCSPi. CSP publicizes and
administers a forum. which allows the
sponsor of the proposal to discuss his or
her ideas with other concerned students.
After receiving feedback at the forum. the
sponsor submits the proposal in its iinal
form to CSP. CSP copies and publiCizes it.

The sponsor is required to collect the.

signatures of at least 200 fullrttme students
belore a referendum on the issue can be
held, it more than 25 percent of the student
body votes in iavor of accepting the pro-
posal land constitutes a simple majority of
those voting) CSP will send the proposal.
along with the results, to our elected ofr
ficials and other interested parties.

The deadline for submiting a proposal to
CSP is September 22. There will be one
referendum in November. Anyone in-
tcrested in submitting a proposal should
contact Ali Elsaffer x1715 or any member
of the Committee on Student Politics. CSP
meets every Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the
SGA offices.
