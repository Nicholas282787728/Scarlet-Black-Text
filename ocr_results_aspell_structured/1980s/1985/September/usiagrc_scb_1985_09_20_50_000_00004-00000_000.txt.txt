T0 IIIB Blilitll':

I am responding to the September 13
issue of the Scarlet and Black entitled
“Driving Policy Changes.” As a concerned
Iriend and a person who has had extensive
contact with Jon Toomsen and the
Toomsen iamily, I feel the article needs
clarification as well as more detailed in
formation, Since the accident In March.
the Grinnell student body has received a
somewhat misleading picture of Jon‘s cori-
dition. Although everything published to
date is true. I feel tllc student body
deserves a better explanation of Jon's con~
ditlon and possibility of recovery

Jon returned to his home in Clear Lake.
lowa. only three weeks ago, Prior to this.
he was a patient at Schoitz Medical Center
in Waterloo, Iowa He was released from
S choitz not. because he had recovered com-
pletely but because his progress had
reached a plateau.

Financial aids syndrome

A strange disease, reported by the
educational testing service (ETS), is
swccpiiig the nation, This disease is [man
cial aids

Alter iccciving the 1935 linancial aid ap-
plications, Mr. Mervin Meep chief clerk of
the sub-sub filing department at ETS,
noticed that several of the financial aid
lorms submitted by students attending coir
leges that cost over $10,000 a year were
nearly illegible

Mr. Mcep tried to remedy this situation
by sending new financial aid forms to the
offending students and he warned them
that the legibillty of their ii eial aid
forms would affect their at illty for
financial aid. the probability or receiving
such aid, and the liability and viability of
their parents to pay for outstanding cosa

remedy the situation. it was composed of
Six certified public accountants, three
LRS. agents, and one thin dime tor moral‘
support

After three weeks of research in the
iield. the haggard team reported back to

Mr, Meep and Ms. Thistle “The situation .

is serious Mr Mcep", Mr. Felix Flutz.
head oi the research team. said

"The students are despondent in morale
a nd show little sign oi iinancial recovery."
he continued, “There are students with
permanently ruptured credit lines. there
are students barely breathing on their
death beds. waiting silently ior their next
Guaranteed Student Loan. and there are
even students who. dare i say it. may

Mr. Meep was shocked. 1n terror, his

alter they had received their awards,

However. his blasts oi hombast were in
vain and again the forms sent to him were
unreadable, As a result, Mr. Meep ordered
Ms. Zelia Thistle. an under clerk or the
subsub tiling department. to personally
p resent the degenerate students with gold»
plated laconically lucid iinancial aid
forms.

in two weeks Ms. Thistle returned, her
blue bureaucratically ellicient hair was in
a warped egg shell. her pince—nez glasses
were watery. Mr. Meep raised halt oi his
leit eyebrow in surprise and asked Ms.
Thistle it her mission was accomplished,
Ms, Thistle choked out in short metallic
clicks that the students to whom she had

tried to give the financial aid forms were -

suirering from a malady that made any
soit oi monetary recognition impossible,
they were suitering from iinancial aids

report. ETS sent a special tinancial aids
team to thc aiihcted students in order to

Jon is in no way a self-sufficient adult
and there isra posshility he may ncvcr
reach this level. He reads and write: but
has trouble thinking logically or
z lytically Therefore. it IS sometimes
diiiicult for him to perform cveryday tasks
which we may take [or granted. Although
he is showing signs oi improvement. his
short-term memory is poor and thereiore
he olten iorgets events which occurred in
the recent past His coordination is good;
for example. he is able to shoot baskets.
However. he has lost a considerable
a mount of weight. His pre-accidcnt
m cmory is excellent and thereiore he may
remember pcoplc he knew beiore the accl~
dent. '

Ileel it is important to show Jon that the
student body has not iorgottcn him. in
order to aid in Jon's recovery it is impor-

tant tor him to receive cards and letters,‘

double chin ruffled into a triple chin and he
shouted. “What is to be done Mr. Flutz’.’ l

students may hand in legible form57"

Mr. Flutz turned his eyes down and said,
”I'm sorry Mr, Meeps but we've tried all
these channels. The admissions oiiices

forms. when we explained the students’
plight. Mr. Reagan said that missiles were
more important than minds, and Mr,
Falwell said that he would only give kuger-

from [r nds. As the school year pro
g i-esses. it is easy to push the events oi last
spring to the back of our minds. However.
I hope that all who know Jon will take the
time to send him a note,

progress to contact either inyscli or Sam

Doors are iunny things. There are big
doors and little doors. ones made of glass,

Doors have developed an entirely new
phenomenon: solid bodies passing
“through" something at least equally
solid. Fcoplc go through doors. dogs go
through doors,.. not the same ones, oi
course. doggies have their own little “dog
gie doors ”

I like doors, though. They give you
something to do and give me something to
watch. Have you ever watched people as
they go through doors7 It's really an art
form and each person has their own style,
Some just sort of burst through (unless, of
course, they're trying to go through the
west doors [if the Science building) and
others tend to do their best at being suave
about the whole affair} a casual walk mov-
ing into a nonchalant shove.

Of course. certain doors require certain
r esponses. The old west saloon doors pracr
tically made the swagger approach to the
door requisite. Those wizzy, automatic
supermarket doors have made door ap
proaches more difficult while easing the
trauma of opening the doors themselves.
They demand that a body adopt a

The opposite can also be true in that the
mind, semicattached to the moving body,
falls to process that the door is automatic
and already open. Thereiore. the body
takes a calm swan dive Into the floor as it
attempts to push through something which
is no longer there.

Human reactions to doors are of an in»
