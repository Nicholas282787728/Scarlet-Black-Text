What to expect

For the Spring Semester of 1985, the Scarlet 8:
Black will:

Strive to provide fair and accurate news
coverage of, and for, the entire campus communi»
ty; Attempt to reflect every pertinent side of every
issue appearing on our news pages; Exercise its
perogative to criticize, applaud or question any
person(s) and/or event(s) within the campus or
world community; Note the names of any person
who acts in a manner which is healthy or unhealthy
for what we preceive to be the General Good of
Grinnell College and give our comment on that per»
son’s behavior; Not use gender specific language
where that language is not applicable or useful;
Maintain free space for our reader’s opinions and
comments.

And, the S&B will take the heat.

But we’ll
still be free . . .

Whether the College chooses to except them or
not, it has been offered two alternatives by the
students: That it pursue a policy of rigorous cone
structive engagement or that it divest all its capital
from South Africa.

President Drake has said that the Trustees and
administration agreed that the College must main-
tain its interests in South Africa in order to bring
about any real changes in the country. The money
we might lose through divestiture is not an issue,
Drake said.

The sentiment from the top seems to be that
divestment of ’our capital would have a nullreffect
on' the situation in that country.

This settiment raises one question in our minds.
If the government of South Africa would never
notice that we were gone, why would they ever
notice that we were there in the first place'.7

The only noticeable action from this side of the
ocean which would have any real affect, of course,
would be a call for sanctions against, or engage
ment with, Sour \ Africa, coming from our man in

the White House.

Out here in Grinnell, if we can’t speak or act for
the rest of the nation then we should at least for
our part show some semblence of consitency. The
College bills itself as a “Liberal” linstitution
(“LiberaL “ in this case meaning that we are about
the business of educating free people to live in a
free society). Meanwhile it makes big bucks off the
exploitation of an entire race.

President Drake asks whether the college will
next be asked to divestfrom any company involved
in the defense or liquor industries. We say yes,

Yes, if that company were building planes which
were being used to bomb a peaceful nation.

Yes, if the consumption of liquor were against the
spirit or the letter of our constitution or school
policy.

But for now, we won’t do as you do. but we'll do as
you say. And, we’ll be free.

Hey Dave

Yuk.

Last week’s special dinner sucked.

Being served pasta, pasta, pasta, and more
casserole sucks.

After four days of nothing else. salad sucks.

Even peanut butter and apples suck.

Fried fish and Fried chicken suck worse than
pasta, pasta, pasta.

The quality of dining hall food has been on a
steady decline for the past two years. The low point
on the curve was reached last Wednesday when
students were given a choice of rice with pork, pork
with pork, chicken on a greasy english muffin or
okra for “Special Dinner.” The “Special” time
before that it was potatoes. For another special din-
ner we are supposed to get peanuts.

That Sucks!
