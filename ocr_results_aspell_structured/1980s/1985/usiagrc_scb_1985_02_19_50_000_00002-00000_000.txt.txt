,: Rainbows: The terminal situation

By Mary Kosmidis and Andrew Konstan-
tnras

The Burllng Terminal Room has
undergone a drastic change. Use oi me 10
Rainbows located there now requires
rented software,

Grinnell College Computer Services
leases the necessary software {or $20. The
package consists oi four iloppy disks: one
system disk and three disks {or word pro-
cessing.This software retails at about 3750.

GCCS purchased a local license which
allows copies oi Hie software to be
distributed on campus (or use at Grinnell.
Copyright restrictions require the soft-
ware be returned to Computer Services
upon departure from Grinnell. The $20 renr
tal covers the cost or the iloppy disks.
(which run for about four dollars apiece).

There are twenty Rainbow microcom-
puters currently in publicly accessible

locations. Ten Rainbows are in Burling. ‘

six in Carnegie, and tour in Noyce/Darby
Only the Noyce Rainbows function as terr
minals without additional software.

During the past year. )8 terminals have
been placed in dormitories. Two more ter-
minals will be installed in Cleveland.

GCCS ofiers two workshops on the use of
the rented soitware. The ﬁrst workshop is
designed to make the user familiar with
the Rainbows and to explain some of the
programs available

The use 01 the systems disk, which
allows access to either of the mainirame
computers irom the Rainbows is also ex-
plained in the workshop. However. only
two oi the ten computers in Burling can be
hooked to the mainframe at any given
time.

The second workshop introduces
.Mass-ll — the word processor — and is
designed to facilitate the switch from
mainirame test editing to microcomputer
word processing.

Tom Moberg. head of academic com-
puting believes that experience gained
with the microcomputers while at Grinnell
will prove valuable for those who go on to
graduate school or a business career.

GCCS had planned the change to take
place in the middle of last semester. The
installment of ma terminals in the last 6-8
months delayed the transition.

If one considers the dramatic rise in
computer use by students and iaculty.
Mobert said. the change should provide a
quick increase in computer accessibility.
Those students not interested in renting
soitware have the option or using the so
publicly accessible terminals on campus.

Physics department
receive. $70,000

Grinnell College has received 3 570.000
grant from the WM. Keck Foundation for
support oi a new atomic physics
iaboratory at the college.

The W.Ml Keck Foundation makes
grants to institutions of higher education
primarily in the areas oi science.
engineering. and medical research and in
Southern Caliiornia also supports
hospitals. community service. and arts
programs.

The iunds will be used principally tor the
building oi a high-quality. iowenergy ac~
celerator as the central piece oi equipment
in the new laboratory.

The accelerator is based on vacuum and
ion~beam technology and does not involve
any radioactive emissions.

The apparatus will be custom~made tor
the Grinnell laboratory and will be design~
ed by Jack A. Stone. Jr.. assistant pros
fessor of physics. who will also supervise
construction oi the unit.

Stone received his bachelor's degree in
physics from the Calitornia institute oi
Technology and his PhD. irom the Univerr
5in of Massachusetts. Amherst. He has
had extensive experience with the kind of
facility to be built atrGrinnell under the
W.M. Keck Foundation grant.
