Students say that lack of Buffer Days
affects quality of school. work

By Mary Kosmidis and Debbie McCuiII
Henry Walker. Chairman oi the
academic calendar subrcommittee,
contends that students. “aren't really
interested in having buffer days."

However, a recent Student Govern-
ment Association survey shows that
students are strongly interested in hav-
ing special days set aside for cogitation
between classes and finals.

In a related questionnaire irom the
curriculum council, some prolessors
responded favorably to buffer days on
an ideologlcal baSIS while others favor
the added pressure caused by the
absence of a break.

0i the 59 responses from the random
sample at 100 upperclass students. only
eight students did not want buffer days.
when asked it they would exchange a
couple days of vacation time in order to
institute buffer days. 46 students were
willing, but i2 were not. Thirty-seven
students preferred to start classes
earlier in August and seven preierred
to end later in December. Only two
students preierred taking a day trom
Thanksgiving break.

Respondents had. on the average,
about two papers at the end of last
semester, The average number of final
exams for the students was three to
(our.

Students said the lack of buffer days
significantly aiiect the quality oi their
school work. Quality suffers when there
is insufficient time to adequately ab-
sorb material according to the
students. On a scale from one to seven
- ranging irom not at all to a great deal
, respondents put the eiiect as greater
than four, Students rated the effect of
no buiier days on their periormance on
iinal exams also as greater than tour.
The degree of stress at the end of the
semester due to the lack of Buffer days
was rated as greater than five.

The average number oi buiier days
desired were more than two with
responses ranging from one to seven.

The iaculty survey yielded more
varied responses. Faculty members
were interviewed by Educational
Policy Committee members of their
departments. The questions were
chosen to stimulate answers beyond a
'yes' or"no' response. The responses
were returned anonymously.

The question. “Are you in favor oi ads
ding buffer days beiore finals?".
received 22 positive responses.
However many oi these respondents
qualified such days as being lmpraC'
tical. Seventeen oi the professors
responded negatively. Some protessors

stated that buffer days already exist on
the present calendar,

when asked where the extra days
should be taken from. 11 professors said
the beginning or the semester. i2 said
the end of the semester, four said
Thanksgiving. three favored fall break.
and three suggested spring break.

Professors rated Hie academic ten-
sion on campus as a moderate 4.19 on a
one to seven scale. At the same time.
most proiessors agree that academic
tension fluctuates throughout each
semester and differs from person to
person, “Some students are stressed;
others are clearly loaling.” said one
proiessor. '

Some iaculty members ieel that the
absence oi buffer days increases
academic tension. however. some pr
Iessors. warned that properly used buf-
fer days could potentially be more
stressful,

Many prolessors agreed that buii;i
days could potentially help students
gain a better understandlllg of thqir
courses. Most of them, however, are
alraid that many students will not use
these days constructively

The questionnaire provided seveml
suggestions as to how tension could he

Faculty against Buffer Da

by The slain stan

The majority of the members present
at this month’s faculty meeting
responded with a resounding “Nay," to
an appeal lrom members oi the cur
l'lculum Committee hoping that a
special committee to study the college‘s
academic calendar could be formed
before it goes into official effect next
Fall.

Currently there are no plans to study
this calendar. part oi a three year ex—
periment which varied the length oi the
Christmas vacation and starting dates
of each semester.

Prompted by a student concern over
the absence ct buffer days. members of
the Curriculum Committee, Professor
of History Alan Jones. Andrew
Konstantaras and Mary Kosmidis,
presented a motion which asked the
iaculty to in turn request the Commit-
tee on Academic Standing to term a
special subcommittee to study the
calendar. The subcommittee was to
have considered other factors in addir
tlon to the absence of buffer days which
may add to the academic stress felt by
students.

The Committee on Academic Stan-
ding is presently studying other sources
oi pressure, but not the calendar

“It would be a Waste of time," Pros
fessor of Mathematics, Henry Walker,
said as he addressed the faculty.

Walker argued that all sections of

classes and labs need to meet the sa
number or days, To add buiier d.
would mean that some Tuesday
Thursday labs might have to meet
Mondays or Wednesdays at the begi
ings or ends oi the semesters. Wal
said.

Walker reminded the iaculty t
most had already expressed
preference ior a 14 week semest

ACM schools and schools who h,
received grants from the Sloane Fouin
dation Walker pointed out that mos
had lew or no buffer days. However
most oi the institutions had shorte
semesters than Grinnell.

Walker also argiied that the {acuity
was currently happy with the numlee
ol lactions and break days built into th-
current Calendar

Walker suggested that the CAS, can
tiiiuc to study other methods of reliev
ing academic pressure rather than any
changes in the calendar.

The majority oi the Faculty agreed.

Dissenters in the meeting argued tha
there was an expressed desire ior bui
lcr days coming from the students an
that the proposed subcommittee nee
not only address the issue of butter d‘a
but could also examine the options oi .
shorter semester or iewer days oil.
