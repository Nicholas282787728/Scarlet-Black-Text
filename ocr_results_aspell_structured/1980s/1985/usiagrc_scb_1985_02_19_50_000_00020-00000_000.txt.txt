The Long Road to Darby . . .

by A. Michael Biaiici and Jim Scott

The road to Darby is long and arduous,
but the nine teams of the IM special ins
terest league would willingly sacriiice
anything lor an opportunity to be crowned
league champion. They want to be known
as the best. This year's teams are guided
through the season by dedicated Special
Interest Commissioner Mickey Munley
and his dedicated staff of professional
referees. The battles that erupt on the
court and the rivalries between teams
makes for some of the most exciting
basketball in Grinnell. along with some of
the most colorful names ior any hoopsters
around. And with further adieu. here are
this week's Bianchcott Bottom of the Bar-
rell rankings:

'1. MUG (54]) 7 What a club! They
possess everything a good basketball team
needs except talent. Just kidding. These
guys are quick, and possess decent height.
They have blown out every opponent
they’ve iaced by at least 30 points. until
this week. They had a “close" game with
the Larry “Bud” Melman Fan Club and
won by only 10 points. i guess they oitend-
ed the “god of late night television.” These
guys are going to be hard to heat.

.2. Liquid Snake Dance (4-1) This team is
the master of the fast break. They seem to
delight in causing heart attacks ior oppos—
ing players due to over exertion. They
have rebounded from last week’s loss to
PMS. The big question with LSD is
Where’s the DEFENSE?

Swim. swim, swim

Lucky seven. The Men’s Swim team won
their seventh consecutive Small College
state meet at Coe College last Saturday,
but luck had little to do with it,

They captured the state crown behind
the iirst place tinishes oi Tim
Laughinghouse in the butterfly (2:017).
Rob Rollins in the 50 freestyle (22.9), Tom
Welander in the 1000 freestyle 1113:4125),
and the 400 medley relay team consi ing
oi Jim Redfern. Laughinghouse, Wandl-
ing. and Welander,

The iinal scores for the meet were as
follows: Grinnell 108 5. Luther 88.5, Loras
57, C08 39, Cornell 22.

Coach Obermiller commented, “We
were ilat, because we have been working
really hard. The team is coming along well
and should continue to do so barring mv
juries.“

3. Pretty Messy Shooters L372t 7 They
heat the highly touted LSD last week. but
this week fell to a much weaker Pink
Flamingos team when only iour oi their
players showed up ior the game Their on»

another fairly weak team, lf the entire
team ever shows up. they could be a iorce
to be reckoned with.

4. Venetian Blinds (471) 7 This iS one of
the league‘s most exciting teams simply
because these guys can’t blow anybody
out. All of their games have been close.
This may be because the Blinds see no
stars on their roster. Definitely a solid con-
tender.

5. The Larry "Bud” Melman Fan Club
(273) e The Larry “Bud" '5 wt-re able to
prevent a “Mugging this week by staying
relatively close to MUG. Mr Larry would
have been pleased. It's been rumored that
