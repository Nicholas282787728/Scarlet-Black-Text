Graduation 1985: Came rain,
snow, sleet, hail or blue skies

by Scott Hildula

okay guys. enough is enough,

Two weeks ago, when I was ly~
ing on the Forum Beach soaking-
up rays and getting iarther behind
in my school work. i tell sorry tor
the iarmers who complained that
it was T00 dry. '

The corn won't germinate you
said. Now my boutonniere is get
ling drenched by a torrential rams
{all that would make students at
Amazon U. jealous, i hope your
little kernels drown,

in case we are now sitting out-
side in a blazing sun listening to
George and others drone on about
the iuutre oi the class oi ‘85, i
want you parents to know why i
don't have a killer George
Hamilton tan, The Administration
asked for rain during ﬁnals week
so that one, seniors would
graduate. and two. the campus
would look lush and green upon
our departure so that we would
remember how lovely the campus
was when we graduated and give
lots of money alter we became old
and well-endowed.

Not me. I'll never iorget the
barren corn stalk siubbied llelds
oi my youth.

orcourso when i came here tour
years ago no one promised balmy
breezes year 'rnund, lithe tanned
bodies or suriing for credit.

Which is good. because i sure
haven't enjoyed any oi the above.

Maybe I shouldn’t complain.
For my trouble to fly the friendly
skies every tall and spring. i have
gotten balmier, snow burned, and
impromptu swimming lessons on
the sidewalk in front 01‘ Gardner
lounge,

I Should have known it would
rain during finals week. Every
auspicius occasion (or an Orego~
nlan like myself is marked by
rain.

Not that 1 should complain.
Alter all. i get to cross the stage
today precisely because it rained
during iinais week. tLast springl
sunburned my lingers so badly
during iinais that i could barely
type. Alter a certain campus
Airicanist assigned three papers
and a debate during the last half

oi this semester, lhave't had time
to stop and apply Calamine.)

The art at complaining about
the weather is honed to periec-
tion while one survives the ‘Grln-
nell Experience.‘ Parents who
have not lived or grown up in Iowa
may not realize the trauma oi
having track meets snowed out.
pit parties while the cyclone hams
wail. or rain on the morning oi
Relays. Worse yet are the horrible
colds we suiier when caught in a
surprise downpour at 2 AM while
weaving our way home irom The
Pub.

Nope. Life here ain't like spring
break in ‘Lauderdale.’ As lowans
are iond oi saying, “Don‘t like the
weather? Stick around 24 hours,
it‘ll change.” The only problem is,
it usually changes to COLD.

One iurther note to any parents
who are holding out on the swell
graduation gilts because we didn't
come home oiten enough or didn't
call it‘s not our iault. Flash
iioods and ireak snow storms are
always making the roads im-
passable and the phone lines in-
operable. Even on Mother‘s Day.

da. the Hutus, a majority. killed
over 100.000 Watusi. Systematic
murder was taking place in Fol
Pat's Cambodia. and in Papa
Doc's Haiti. Evil had not died
when Hitler did.

This was all very rar irom
home, Anti-Semitism died in
America long ago. I went to
Israel, where my cousins told me
my place in the world was the Jor-
dan Valley, not the decadent
United States. They told me I
must light ior Judaism. but 1
would not tight. 1 am an
American.

My brother. when I told him I
thought Zionism preposterous,
Said, “We have to take care of our
own.” Not me. I thought. I am an
American.

when Ronald Reagan made his
statement that the Waffen SS
were merely victims at Nazism,
my first feelings were elation. His
famous ability not to be held ac-
countable [or his own gaiies seems
ed to be cracking. The Des Moines
Register printed a dozen or more
angry letters. Then. in May 12. a
reader wrote: “Thirteen million
people. by the best estimates.
were killed by the Nazis, of whom
6 million were Jews. In other
words. 7 million were of other
faiths... Only the Jews consistent-
ly reconstruct and iorever relive
those horrors. All others want to

iorget and reconstruct,“ Out of
the world’s live billion people. ap»
proximately ten million are Jews.
In other words. that six million
represented a substantial number
of Jews who would have been
alive today, We should
reconstruct. yet, and we have. but
should we forget? Not me.
although 1 am an American.

On May 13. a letter from my
mother arrived with a newspaper
clipping which said that the
synagogue in my hometown had
been vandalized, The vandals has
stacked prayer books and
American and Israeli flags in the
center and set fire to them. This
was in New York, where the
population prides itself on its
opensmindedness. Can I forget
this? Not me, although I am an
American,

An American Civil Liberties
Union poster on a friend’s bulletin
board down the hall says: “‘Eter—
nal vigilance is the price oi liber-
ty.“ it we are to prevent iurther
recurrence of evil. we must use
our power or persuasion and
education to make our fellow
citizens aware of how easily the
world can turn back to genocide
tor Haitians. for Cambodians. for
Hutus and Watusi, and even for
Jews. We must be aware of this.
We are Americans.
