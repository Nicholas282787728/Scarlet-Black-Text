do ° Goodfellow joins Truman ranks

Sophomore Soviethmerican Rela-
tions major Jim Goodfellow has been
awarded the Truman Scholarship for
the State of Wisconsin—an award that
“speaks for itself," said Grinnell
Tmman Adviser Walt Stone.

Goodfellow will be given the scholar-
ship at a ceremony in Independence,
Missouri, on May 4th. He joins senior
Dave Blatt (West Virginia) as Grin-
nell Truman winners presently on
campus.

The scholarship, in its fourth year,
gives each winner $5000 for two years
each of undergraduate and graduate
study while also providing prestigious
summer internships.

Stone said, “i perceive the selection
process at Grinnell as quite com-
petitive” and the award is “quite a
personal accomplishment for him."
Stone also mentioned that the ex-
ecutive director of the foundation had
said Goodlellow was one of the top
candidates nationally.

Goodfellow’s reaction upon hearing
of the award from his iather on April

15th was that of surprise, because he
did not expect to be told until today.
“It’s hard to believe that the scholar-
ship and everything that gm with it
are mine," he said.

Goodfellow inititally applied because
his adviser, Wayne Mayer, who was in
charge of the program last year, felt
he had a good shot at winning. The
first application step was sending
recommendations and writing essays,
which Goodfellow said were time con»
suming and “a real exercise in word
choice” since the essays were on
policy issues and of 500 words or less.

After being notified he was a
semifinalist for the Wisconsin scholar-
ship, Goodfellow flew to Chicago for
an interview on March 5. ”The goal,”
said Goodfellow, “was to see if we
could think on our feet under pressure,
rather than just by reciting stored
knowledge. Only one specific policy
question was asked.”

One requirement of the Truman pro-
gram is that all applicants enter some
form of public service. Goodfellow

said he hopes to pursue his Juris Doc-
torate and Masters in International
Relations simultaneously. He said, ”I
want to be as capable as I can in per
forming a variety of functions before
entering government, but I guess my
real long-term goal would be to con»
tribute in some original capacity to an
institution of government or perhaps
even to the pervasive philosophy of
government.

“As a Grinnell applicant, my
chances of winning were enhanced
because the committee knows Grinnell
takes the process very seriously.
When applying to grad schools, the
Grinnell transcript is a very positive
factor in any selection process haying
to do with academics.

“Grinneli has opened for myself and
all students here a great many new
avenues to how one approaches sub-
ject matters and which subjects one
approaches. I'm much more concern
ed with the aspects of the social
sciences which evaluate reactions to
mass opinions," he added.

College gears up for inauguration

Grinnell College has set Sunday,

tion of Dr. George A. Drake as the in-

. Enrollment .
may not drop

The long anticipated decline of col-
lege and university enrollments may
not be coming after all, says the
American Council on Education
(ACE).

The decline in the number of tradi-
tional college-age (13724) people has
produced predictions that college
enrollment will drop by a much as 25
percent in the 15305. But according to
a recent ACE study, the decline could
be much smaller than that, or college
enrollments could level off or even in
crease as much at 3.5 percent.

ingham in Bloomfield, Minn. The Rev.
