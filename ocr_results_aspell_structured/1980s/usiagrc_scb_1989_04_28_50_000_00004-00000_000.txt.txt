GORP explores Lone Star state

by Michael Mullen

For the second year in a row.
the Grinnell Outdoor Recreational
Program went to Big Bend Na
tional Park in Texas over spring
break. GORP members split
into two groups: one for a
canoeing trip which began down
the Rio Grande river and the other
for a bi ng trip headed to the
Chisos mountains for an attempt
at Emory Peak.

The canoeing group left civi-
lization with six cancers and
plenty of enthusiasm. Floating
down the border between the
United States and Mexico. we
saw the unreal character of na-
tional borders. Prosperity and
need were divided by a river shal-
low enough to wade across.

Continuing down river, we
came closer and closer to what we
knew to be Boquilas Canyon. a
20-mile stretch of 7004001 cliffs.
As we approached from the flat,
smooth, rolling waters of the
desert. I wondered what lay ahead.
A study in geology. the canyon
exposed cons of time. Less than
a mile into the canyon we saw a
dramatic fault line cutting
through an entire 700-fool wall.
When we camped that night in-
side the canyon. the near-full

moon and stars lit up the canyon
walls. exposing beautifully soft
shades of rod and brown.

We awoke to the smell of
Bisquick. Our second day was a
leisurely ﬂoat sporadically inter—
rupted by such things as a naked
man singing. “La Linda. the
beautiful. . .' and a moderate
class-II rapid much like the log
ride at Adventureland.

Meanwhile hikers had been in
the Chisos Mountains, enjoying
high-altitude desert hiking. Al»
though I did not go on this trip,
rumors suggest that it was high-
lighted by an early-moming sun-
rise on Emory Peak and the an-
tics and stories of Eric Stevens.
The highest point in Texas.
Emory Peak offers a dramatic
view of the surrounding desert.
Vistas of 30 miles or more are
not uncommon.

Joining together after every»
one’s first excursion into big
bend, the group hired a boat to
Mexico for a late-night dinner in
Lhe town of Santa Elena. Served
the only dish on the menu. the
tarnished group quickly devoured
the meal and began to dance to
the music of the local boombox.

The next morning. the grout
split up again. One half began t
longer trip down the Rio Grande
and the other left for Hueco
Tanks State Park for some rock
climbing. The canoe trip was
highlighted by canoe tip-overs,
Within the first hour of the trip.
a boat had tipped twice and by the
end of the trip. everyone and ev-
erything had gotten wet. The ca—
noers even had to wring bagels
out for lunch one day. They also
held canoe races in which Eric
Stevens was said to have jumped
out into the shallow water in at.
tempt to push his boat to vic-
tory. The vertical walls of
Mariscal Canyon and a place
called the “Light squeeze,“ where
the entire river ﬂows through two
rocks spaced ﬁve feet apart. added
excitement to the trip.

Meanwhile, in Hueco Tanks.
the climbers were awed on the
approach to the state park. The
3004001 cliffs of Hueco Tanks
stood at the entrance and everyone
was eager to climb. Beginning
with some moderate routes on the
first day. we progressed to some
overhangs on the second. Far

Chinese singles scene sizzles

least 25 years old. college gradu-
ate. at least 1.7 meters tall. .

The ad in question appeared as
a preface to a magazine article
entitled.Nu "Du" Su She. which
is a play on words meaning both
a university dormitory for fe—
males and a dorm for “old
women." he said.

The article was a proﬁle of
four women in their ‘305 who
lived in a dorm for unmarried or
divorced women. The article ex»
plored their frustrated social lives,
their deep depression. and the
jealousy they felt towards a friend
who had a newborn daughter.

A study of urban social life
conducted by two Western soci-
ologists in the I970s and early
‘805 concluded that no “dating
culture" existed in China. That
is obviously no longer the case.

Chinese society is still fairly
conservative in that all people are
expected to want to get married
and have a child. As the article
about the “old women‘s dorm"

. illustrates. women who are not
married by 30 are considered to be

av arsrnvuton ONLY

pretty much old maids who uni
doubtedly are bitter about their
fate.

Until recently there were few
ways to meet prospective part-
ners. People were assigned jobs
by the government and changing
jobs was unheard of. There were
no dance clubs or bars. Casual
conversations between members
of the opposite sex were consid—
ered rather risque.

However. as the economic-
reform program progressed and
China opened up to influences of
the outside world. various
institutions of Western cultures
found there way behind the Barn»
boo Curtain. Not only did disco
dance halls spring up. but groups
ranging from factory work units

to foreign-language night schools
began holding parties so that
their members could mingle.

Personal ads began appearing
in newspapers and “marriage bu—
rcaus“ offering matchmaking ser-
vices began forming in the major
cities. The bureaus enjoy a large
clientele because they are free. or
at least very cheap. and fairly re;
spectable since references are
checked very carefully. Mem-
bers’ ftles are traded and everyone
is kept up to date on when the
next party will be held.

A twist on the swinging-sin-
gles theme are the “elderly mar-
riage bureaus“ that try to pair up

Meredith Levy and Ethan Angeli paddle by the 700
foot cliffs of the Boquila Canyon on the Rio Grande. Levy
and Angeli travelled to Texas on a recent GORP trip.

Hueco Tanks is a winter-climb
ing mecca. Having met other
climbers on the third day. we
planned to climb the first 180
feet of a desert classic called ”sea
of holes" with them. Unfortu~
nately, rain dashed our plans.
The climbers left for Big Bend in
search of sunnier skies and the
cancers were left behind.

Reunited once again, the
group left Big Bend for Del Rio
and San Antonio for some more
Mexican cultural experiences and
a little bit of history at the
Alamo before heading back to
Iowa.

Like all trips. GORP trips
have both good and bad mo-
ments. Bad times included losing
$1400 worth of traveler's checks.
getting rained out on the climb—
ing trip. eating sand with meals
on the Rio Grande. and forgetting
a sleeping bag which meant
somebody had to rough it each

night. However. good things
outweigh the bad on every trip.
Nobody will forget the water
fights. backrubs. beautiful
scenery. skills Ieamed. hacky-
sack games, people. and friend—
ships gained. And nobody for—
gets the Alamo.
