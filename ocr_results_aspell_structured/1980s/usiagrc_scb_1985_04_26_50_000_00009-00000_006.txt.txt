Mortt Crowe's odyssey is one shroud-
ed in mystery. Believed to have been
the adopted son oi a majnrrleague third
base coach killed by lightning during a
rain delay. Crowe grew up knowing a
little bit about baseball and a lot about
freak accidents. He says his middle
name. Mortt. comes from the French
word inortc. meaning “death.” but he's
not certain about that. He received a
b ‘ ball scholarship to Harvard
University but dropped out after one
semester in order to study
philosophical perspectives under an
Italian Yogi whom he is believed to
have met through his father.

During his time with his new mentor
Crowe learned the ways of the austere
lite. Upon parting with the Yogi he was
the owner only of the clothes on his
back. a decrepit baseball glove and a
Jew's harp. His landlady said that she
hears him playing his Jew‘s harp at
night. but he plays it softly and sweetly.
so she doesn't really mind it.

Worley once asked a musician
visiting the Grinnell campus to listen to
Crowe‘s harp playing and to see it he
could really play or it he was just messy
ing around The musician is reported to
have been so overwhelmed by the
musical tones Crowe twangod from his
harp that he recommended that Crowe
be asked to join the Mirecourt Trio. The
baseball glove. according to rumor.
once belonged to a Chicago Cub first
baseman and thus has never been
heavily used.

Crowe adds to the mystery that en
shrouds him by rarely associating with
other iaculty members or students. Ac
cording to Worley. Crowe insisted that
his position on the Grinnell faculty be

treated as an experiement and under‘

Crnwe's own set or rules.
For one thing. Crowe insists on
teaching his classes in a darkened room
away irom the rest ot the classrooms.
He also insists on avoiding iaculty
meetings and other associated rcspon
sibilitics. and both idiosyncracics are
irritating to Worley. who must decide
whether to let the unusual but extraorr

,dinarily talented teacher stay on fullr

time
Crowc‘s students are made
somewhat uneasy by his high-powered
lectures. but they all insist that he has
some of the best insights into
Aristotelian epistemology they have
ever seen and handles platonic
Criticism of the formulaic universe
equally well. Some students are more
impressed with the speed with which
Crowe delivers complex lectures. while

others insist the accuracy or his ,
arguments is what makes him so
special.

The future of Mortt Crowe at Grinnell
is uncertain. Mostly because of his
relatively anonymous presence here
nobody seems too upset or concerned
with Whether or not he will Stay. Even
Worley is uncertain what will become
of Crowe. “He really blows the kids
away at the 200 level," Worley said,
“but nobody knows it he can stand up to
the upper level classes and senior
research projects. Mostly, though. it‘s
up to Mortt whether or not he says.”

The iconoclast classroom wizard is
expected to announce sometime this
weekend his plans regarding his future
at Grinnell College. When we tried to
ask him for a hint as to his intentions.

Jew's harp out of the old glvbe and
twanged a tune that seemed played to
the beat of a different drummer.
