E‘Grouncls For Thought’

our lederal government has {or
, litany years been nurturing the idea of
“civil defense" as one worth looking at
. tor Its potentially life-saving proper»
ties. There are three basic types or civil
‘ defense: blast shelters, fallout shelters
and evacuation. The difference bet-
' ween blast and fallout shelters is that
y the former are for areas which are like-
ly to be quite close to “ground zero” oia
4 bumb's detonation 7 superhardened
structures which can withstand more
« than ten pounds per square inch of over-
pressure through the use of steel-
‘ reinforced concrete and similar hardy
‘ materials. Fallout shelters are for
areas which are unlikely to have exten-
,slve blast damage but in which it will
be necessary to stay indoors [or days or
tweeks. .
’l'he ironic thing about civil defense is
t that even the best-case scenarios force
us to envision a life in which the very
‘ things ior which the war is being taught
t"ireedom". “capitalism", and the
likel are destroyed in the attempt to de-
i |end them.
One of the primary resources on civil
Adefense planning available to the
general public. the Office of Technology
‘Assessment's The Effects of Nuclear
lViar. has a series of stories with cheer-
ful titles like "A Soviet Attack on US.
,Uil Refineries", In the case tiﬂed “A
Large Soviet Attack on 11.5. Military
.und Economic Targets". the basic pros
blem is summed up neatly:
The American way oflife is
characterized by material
possessions. with private
ownership or items
representing substantial
long-term investments
tsuch as homes.
businesses. and
automobiiesl being the rule
rather than exception.
Widespread loss or in-
dividual assets such as
these could have a strong,
lasting effect on our social
structure. Similarly. the
question of whether in-
dividual right to ownership
of surviving assets would
remain unchanged in a
postatiack environment
would arise. For example.

In other words. suppose we are lucky
and such a thing as limited nuclear war
does exist and that somehow some of us
manage not to be immediately cooked
or irrevocably irradiated. Then, sups
pose that we are somehow mentally
a ble to continue to live despite the terri-
ble grief that would be ours when we
knew what had happened to a certain
number 01 our compatriots (and
remember that military parlance has
often called the loss of 20,000,000
Americans an ”acceptable loss"7. Sup-

pose that thc devastated area was not
one which provided the most crucial
services the. that a huge number or
larms was not wiped outi, Suppose that
there is relatively little "breakdown of
lav» and order” and that police forces
are willing to go to work instead of stay

tar. our scenario is "best-case” in
every possible way. However. there are
relugees to be taken in. perhaps a lot of

tant detonation would be likely to topple
houses.

Now. suppose that you are suddenly
deprived of that house it took you
decades to build and the only place for
you to go is the home oi that neighbor

The neighbor already has a hundred
people in his house — they are shocked
and scared and there is no longer any
place to move and the neighbor has a ri-

your life if you try to enter without per-

certainly mundane in light or all the
other things that are likely to be going
wrong in the event of any kind .01

However mundane it may be. one

Perhaps that doesn't mean a lot to you,

It is a very diiiicuit thing to be able
even to picture 500.000 people. 1 saw
500.000 people pass by once in a nuclear
lreeze rally in New York City on June
12. 1932, it took approximately five
hours for that many people to pass by
on a twoslane road. or course. one

million people is even harder to imr
agine. a virtual infinity as tar as the
human mind is concerned.

So do not picture nuclear war as
meaning the death of a mass oi
20.000.000 people. Picture it as your
death — you know and presumably like
yoursell and know what a loss it would
be it you died. Picture the loss 01 your
best friend, your parents. your dog.

There are government oiiicials who
