Pagliai's finishes ﬁrst
8 and B rates Grinnell plzzas

by Bill Warburton

No one can deny that pizza is
an integral pan of college life. It
is true by definition. The
friendly chefs at Breadcaux, God-
father's. Jimbo‘s. Pagliai's. and
Pizza Hut have done their best to
satisfy the hungry college
masses. Are they doing thejob'!

Naturally. Grinnellians must
be at least somewhat satisfied.
considering that they order pizza
in bulk, but the question of
whether or not their pizza is any
good lies undisturbed. That is,
until now. An unprecedented
comprehensive study and exami-
nation was conducted to get to
the root of the problem.

A group of 11 food critics
convened last Sunday and rated
the various pizms of Grinnell ac-
cording to the following criteria:
cheese. sauce. crust. toppings.
and overall taste. Each evaluator
rated these criteria on a scale of l
to 5, with 5 indicating
“excellent“ and 1 “."poor After a
long and arduous session of eons
suming a dreadfully large amount
of free pizza, the group of critics
had completed their individual
assessments and a mean score for
each of the'crileria was calculated.
The results were not pretty.
With a mere score of 3.4.
Pagliai’s had the highest rating
for overall taste. Trailing the
leader was Pizza Hut (3.1).
Breadeaux (2.9). Godfather‘s
(2.3). and Jimbo's (2.1). The
evaluators were a hard-to-please
lot.

In addition to receiving the
best overall-taste rating. Pagliai’s
had the best toppings (3.6) and
crust (3.2) scores. The crust
evaluation was derived after ex-
amining both their “thin" crust

and their “double“ crust. Most of
the critics considered Pagliai‘s to
be the best of the bunch, yet
there lacked much enthusiasm for
it. Mike Ellis summed it up
rather well: “Tasted the best of
them all. Suprising. since I eat
this stuff every week and hate it."
Pizza Hut led in the cate-
gories of cheese (32) and sauce
(35). It was a fairly well-re-
ceived pizza. Although Pizza
Hut has recently introduced a
“traditional" pizza, it was the pan
pizza that was evaluated by the
experts out of respect to its long-
standing acceptance as the restau-
rant‘s pizza of choice. No matter
what kind of pizza you order.
Pizza Hut’s prices are the highest
in Grinnell; 2 large pizza costs
$10.58. Most found the pizza
overwhelmingly abundant with
crust. Jessica Weisel, whose
highest overall-taste evaluation
was a 2, commented. “Too
chewy. Greasy. Looked good
when it was in the box. but it
should have smyed there." Some
peoplejust can’t be pleased.
Many of the critics noted that
the Breadcaux pizza under exami-
nation looked old. as if it had
been sitting around for awhile.
Vince Bechtel said that the pizza
was "aesthetically lacking. but
overall taste was fine." Bread-
caux, with their internationally
renowned french-bread crust,
failed to convince the critics that
the crust was any good. They
found it thin and chewy, They
added that the sauce was virtually
non-existent. One critic comr
plained that the sauce had “funny"
green spices. The criticisms in-
dicate that the pizza would have
received a higher rating if it had

Passover history and

by Susan Roth

The 15th day of the month
Nisan in the Jewish calendar (this
year, April 19) is the first night
of one of Judaism’s most impor-
tant holidays: Passover. The
eight-day holiday commemorates
both the Jewish self-liberation
from slavery in Egypt. which is
one of the tuming points of chr
ish history. and the uncicnt festi—
val of spring. which involved of-
fering up the first fruits to the
temple in Jerusalem. Not
coincidentally. Passover is timed
to fall during the spring in accorr
dance with its symbolism of the
rebirth. renewal. and hope that
come along with freedom from
oppression. The tcrm “Passover"
itself refers to the tradition that,
during the last of the 10 plagues,
the Angel of Dcatlt killed off the
firstrborn children of Egyptian
families. but passed Over the
homes of the Jewish families.
who had been previously ht
structed to mark their doorposts
with the blood of a lamb (also.
the Hebrew term pesrtch nlcans
“lo pass over.")

Central lo the celebration of
Passover is the Seder (Hebrew for
“ortlcr"), tI ceremonial formal
dinner IJIt’Il retells the story of the

Exodus through the use of the
Haggadalt. a book that contains
the story of the Exodus from
Egypt. as well as the related
songs and prayers. and the com-
mentaries that answer the Four
Questions (traditionally asked by
the youngest child in the family)
concerning why this particular
night is so different from other
nights. Also central to the Seder
is the platter that contains the
five symbolic foods which play
an integral part in the Seder cer-
emony: a roasted lamb bonc.
representing the paschal lamb
sacrificed on tlte eve of the Exo-
dus; a roasted egg. representing
the temple sacrifices that were
offered on all holidays; the bitter
hcrbs (tnuror). usually horseradish
or romaine lettuce. recalling the
bitterness of cnslavcmcnt; the
mixture of ground nuts and any
pics wtth wine (haroscl). repre-
senting the mortar tlte slaves used
to make bricks; and parsley. rep»

been fresh. It is the most inex-
pensive pizza in town, with large
pizzas costing $6.48. But. there's
a catch. One can not buy a sin-
gle pizza. but is instead forced to
buy a pair of pizzas. two larges.
two mediums. or two smalls. A
“Le Petite" seven-inch pizza is
offered individually. but its size
would certainly fail to sale the
average collegiate appetite.

The Godfather's pizza was
met with a general malaise. No
one cared for it much at all. “The
pizza was kind of greasy and soft.
There wasn‘t enough cheese and
the meat lacked flavor." com-
mented Glen Widmer. The
largest problem with Godfather's
was the sauce. Many of the
evaluators thought that the sauce
tasted like Ragu. In a flurry of
sauce-bashing. the critics seemed
to contradict themselves. with
one complaining about its
“acidic“ quality, another its
“bitterness." and yet another its
even “sweetness." Despite the
confusion. the message is clear:
the sauce is not pleasant.

Jimbo’s popular and much—
consumed pizza took a beating in
the ratings. lagging behind its ri-
vals in every category except
cheese. Half of the evaluators
thought it was pretty good. he-
stowing scores of three or four.
But the second half of critics de-
stroyed the pizza, with scores of
one virtually across the board.
They complained of its bland
character and overall “yuckiness.”

The pizza of Jimbo's is the
most economical of delivery piz-
zas in Grinnell, far outpacing
Pagliai‘s and Godfathcr‘s. A
small pizza costs only $4.50. Its

low price. along with what many
believe to be a good taste, has
made Jimbo's a success. After a
few beers. the most fervent
Jimbo's critic will devour its
pizza greedily.
Even those generally satisfied
with the pizza were disappointed
in the crust, which they charged
simply has no taste.

If the critics are a fairly nor-
mal sample of the Grinnell

population. the state of affairs is
grim. The people lack enthusir
asm for the pizza they are pro-
vided with. The truly excellent
pizza proves elusive. What is to
be done? Perhaps the pizza
places should change their recipes
a tad. Would that be too much to
ask?

Perhaps we should just drink
more beer.

Masquerade instills mystery and romance
Sprtng Waltz dons masks

by Heather Terrence

A ballroom fills with ele-
gantly dressed men and women.
As a symphony plays in the
background, the dancers take to
the floor. their eyes shrouded by
masks. A typical scene from the
days of royal courts. for certain,
but this is also the scenario that
the Spring Waltz Committee
rznzcmbers hope to create on April

Cindy Jones. special»evcnts
coordinator. said that she hopes
the “masquerade-ball" theme will
instill an air of romance and
mystery in this year's waltz.
During the time that waltzes were
popular. the masquerade ball was
a novel way to add excitement.
Ideally. Jones and the committee
would like to see every student
wearing the mask until revealing
him or herself at midnight. The
Spring Waltz is traditionally a
more formal event, which makes'
the theme Jones calls “traditional
and digniﬁed” especially appro»
priate. The committee also felt
the idea of masks would make
this waltz stand out. rather than
being just one more Spring
Waltz.

The Des Moines Symphony
Ensemble will provide the
dancers \lith classical waltz mu-
sic. The addition of live mus is
traditional with the Spring Waltz,

Jones stresses that the Waltz
is not a costume party, but a
chance for Grinnellians to don
masks they either buy or make.
While there have been sugges-
tions that some floors will have
mask-making study breaks. Jones
says that no campus-wide plans
have been set to make or dis-
tribute masks.

At the Waltz. it is hoped that the

variety of other rcfreshmens will
be served as well.
