Real clowns start own newspaper

Though most people know Ronald
McDonald to be a typically apolitical
iigurehead for the restaurant franchise
“McDonald’s," he announced today
that he would be editing a new radical
newspaper as a service to the Grinnell
College community.

McDonald stated that it was “about
time" that the college gained a new
journal that would allow students and
faculty alike to understand what he

.lttermed “the fried viewpoint." “This

campus is politically oriented towards
only one direction." McDonald added.
“and I would like to give the silent but
large group of people who don't agree
with that View something totally inane
to read so that they can see my name in
print."

McDonald feels conﬁdent that “those
suckers in SGA” will help fund his pro

expects to come out bi-weekly and
which will be called “The Whimper”

and careful reporting with only a slight
bias towards the franchise McDonald
supports.

“It won't be a fast-food journal per

espouse only the views of the fast food
industry.” He went on to explain that he

College team indicted for point showing,

by Jen Raymond

Grinnell College officials are ex-
pected to decide early next week
whether the school will continue spon-
soring a debate team in the [ace of a
scandal in which Grinnell debaters
allegedly shaved points for pay.

Coming in the wake of the basketball
pmnt-shaving scandal at Tulane
University that broke late last month
Grinnell officials are expected to take a
tough line regarding the incident. The
Tulane basketball program has been
discontinued by the University,

uncharacteristically lackadalslcal in
their rebuttals.

Said Pfitsch after the match. “I was
surprised how much we gave up in the
second half. We just missed too many
easy scoring opportunities and they
completely ont-rebutted us.
