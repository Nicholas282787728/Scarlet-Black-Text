the issues are contained in his cam-
paign literature. "Janet just hasn‘t had
much publicity," he added, “People
may not agree with me, but at least
they can read what I have to say." His
stands on the state constitutional issues
are support or the ERA and opposition
to the constitutional convention, which
he sees as unnecessary. Edwards feels
that other major issues are
maintenance oi quality education in
Iowa, establishment of land use
guidelines, the lack oi capital iormation
(which he feels restricts the yowth of
small businesst, and preservation oi
the family larm. Some reiorms he
would like to see are the establishment
oi sunset laws for government agenr
Cles, elimination of state income tax on
savmgs accounts, and changes in inn
herilance laws to make it easier for the
surviving spouse and children to retain
and operate iarms and iamily
businesses.

A problem that Edwards sees in the
coming election is the possibility that
people may associate him with the New
Right simply because he is a
Republican, He sees himseli as a
moderate Republican and feels that
this is a point in his favor. "If people
don‘t lilie the way parts ot the
Republican Party are going, voting [or
moderate candidates is one way they
can aiiect what the party will be like. I
don't think that Janet Carl and I are
that lar apart on the issues. If someone
is satisfied with the way the
Democratic Party is going, but would
like to see a more moderate Republican
Party, that’s one good reason to vote {or
me.”

Constitutional Questions

Iowa voters will be considering two constitutional questions in the 1530 elec»
tion. The first is whether to add an Equal Rights Amendment to the Iowa Con-
stitution; the second is whether a convention should be called to propose
amendments to the Iowa Constitution.

The Iowa ERA has been approved by two consecutive legislatura and needs
the approval of a majority of the voteis in the coming election to become part of
the Iowa Constitution. The amendment reads as [allows (the words in boldface
are those proposed to be added to present working of the constitution):

All men and women are, by nature, free and equal. and have cer-
tain inalienable rights a among which are those of enjoying and
defending lite and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting
property, and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.

Neither the state nor any oi its political subdivisions shall, on the
basis oi gentler. deny or restrict the equality oi rights under the
law.

ERA opponents often argue that the amendment is not needed. They contend:
that present statutes, along with the US. and Iowa Constitutions, guarantee
equal protection under the law for women.
