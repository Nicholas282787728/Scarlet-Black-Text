The Grinnell tootball team gave
good eiiorts in each oi the three
games they have played since our
last issue. These efforts were not
good enough, though, to knock oii
any oi the three opponents,

Coe ill. Grinnell 7

Grinnell gave a gutty perfor-
mance in a game that saw them
control the ball for significant
stretches but not overcome tradi-
tional powerhouse Coe. Good per-
iormances in this game included
an impressive births-bench
rushing'game by Chris Geisert and
the scrambling oi QB Jim Wciand,
who frustrated the Coe defensive
line most oi the day by continually
running just out oi their grasp.
Geisert rushed 29 times for 101
yards, a career high. The Pioneer
score was the result or a 10-yard
pass from Weiand to Rich Wilson

The defense was led by Scott (307
lugs (11 tackles, B unassisted) and
Mike Anderson 16 unassisted
tackles). Also, Wallace Squibb had
a sack ior 72 yards and 3 tackles

in the end, Grinnell seemed to be
just too out-manned to pull oil the
upset. Fan quote oi the day irom
Russ Grimm: “Sure, Coe is a de-
cent football team, but as a future
employer, i'm not all that impress-
ed with what I See."

Knox i2. Grinnell 21

The big news out oi this game,
which occurred while most oi you
were at home enjoying the beginn-
ing oi your break, was that Grinnell
came out and scared the7out oi
division-leading Knox beiore losing
their lead and the game in the
second half. Grinnell scored iirst
and held a in lead beiore Knox
came back to tie it at the half and
blow the game open in the third
quarter. Grinnell won the battle oi
the statistics. out-gaining the
Siwash ldon’t ask me what one is, i
just report them: 375 to sin,

With respect to ottense, Craig
whitaker had a career day, carry-
ing 14 times tor 114 yards. Dave
White scored twice. and Geisert
scored once ior Grinnell. 0n
deiense, Tom Monogue and Mike
Mohan had interceptions. Also,
Boardman, Squibb, Anderson, and
Dabrley all had QB sacks. Leading
the delense, however, was irosh
John Lopos, who had 7 tackles and
2 pass breakups.

Bystanders at this game said
that Grinnell should have been
ahead by at least 28 to 7 at the half,
but things just didn't work out.
rour turnovers were detrimental
to the Pioneer ellort.

Cornell tit, Grinnell 112

Lastyear, Grinnell pulled a huge
upset in beating Cornell 1&3. This
year, the Rams got a taste of
revenge by taking Grinnell out in
their homecoming.

Once again, Grinnell got the
jump on the opposition by jumping
to a 24»21 halftime lead. And once
again, a third quarter irom hell
spelled doom ior the Pioneers as
the Rams turned a 3rpoint halitime
deflcit into an 11-point fourth
quarter lead.

Coach Martlnck said, “Our at-
tltude and spirit were fine from the
start. but lapses, especially
penalties, must be eliminated ior
us to win,”

Welcome back irom break,
sports fans, and welcome back to
the world of women's cross Counr
try. Here's a recap oiwhathappen
ed since the last issue.

To begin with, three weekends
ago the women’s team traveled to
Dubuque ior the lowa Small Col
lege Championships. Let's
rephrase that: the Lady Pioneers
sent only live runners to the meet
and only four tinished the race,
which amounted to a nonscoring
team ior Grinnell tteams must
iinish live to score). The reason tor
the low turnout was that the meet
was on a Friday and many oi the
women had labs or classes. Only at
Grinnell are sporting events miss-
ed for academicsl

 

Highlights ior'Crinnell included
scores by Rich wilson and l>aul
Manternach on passes irom Daiie
white and runs by Manternach and
Jim Weiand tor TDs Also, Mike
Mohan kicked 2 PATs and a
83-yard lield goal as time ran out in
the that hall and Mick Maclean
ran tor a 2~point conversion, In ad-
dition. punter Scott Truesdell now
leads the conierencc with a
39.27yard average.

Next up tor the team is poweriul
Monmouth College at Monmouth
lllinois. Monmouth in all likelihood
will win the southern division
because they beat Coe, 1+7, The
game is billed as "David vs
Goliath" by Coach Martinek, but
he is hoping ior a repeat ol the
Come-fromrbehiml victory oi two
years ago when the Pioneers beat
the Scots rim.

Heading for Good
Times

No weekends ago. October i7,
was a diiierent story. The women
ventured into Coe country for the
lz-team Kohawk Invitational. This
was by tar the finest race that the
team has run this year, as the Lady
Harriers placed two runners in the
top to at a very competitive tield.
Freshman Katherine Falrbank led
the runners as she placed in the
number nine spot, while
sophomore Adrianne Clark placed
15th. This meet was an excellent
indication of where the Lady
Pioneers are headed, as all of the
healthy women runners improved
their times. One such runner was
sophomore Jennifer Stanton, who
dropped an impressive tour
minutes off of her time.

Last Weekend, Coach Freeman's
squad was scheduled to go to Can
tral College tor a meet but. decided
to cancel it and use the time to
prepare for the upcoming Midwest
Conference Championship Meet
(held here at Grinnell) in a week,

During break, the women put in
some heavy-duty mileage as they
tracked across 45 miles or our fair
city. This weekend, the women will
run in the Warthurg Invitational as
a warmup ior Conference. And
with top runner Dorothy shearn
back, the Lady ’Neers look very
goodl

“ll you Can't go to college, go to
Coe." Yes, Pioneer iootball ians, it
was the moment you were all
waiting ior, when the iamed
Kohawks invaded Grinnell turi ior
this annual match-up, which was
marked by iastpaced action, both
on and oil the iield

For those of you who have never
attended a GrinnellCoe match-up,
you've missed out on an entire
cultural experience, At periodic in»
tervals, the crowd breaks out into
cheers proclaiming, “It you Can't
go to college, go to Coe.” My
iorgetiulness prevents me irom
repeating the rest oi the lyrics. but
you can imagine the remainder oi
the chorus. Vocal support ior this
beliei was noticeably absent, but
throughout the game, some die»
hard Grinnellians tlashed some
large signs with the lyrics written
on them. it must have been the
cold weather that stopped them
irom shouting. Darn, I was all ex~
g cited to scream my lungs out.
it i don't know who designed the
* Coe uniiorms or picked out the col
*ors, it looks like the work oi the
,‘San Diego Chicken to me. .leez, il
gthe Russians wanted to start a
rtnuclear war in iowa, they would
Ir have to look no further than Cedar
* Rapids tor a visible target, i mean.
the Coe players wore some oi the
brightest uniiorms that l have ever
seen in my liietime. ithought neon
colors went out or iashion a iew
years back. Maybe Coe is trying to
start a trend or something. Let's
hope not.

it could be that the costumes
(oops, i mean unllorms. talks)
were designed in keeping with the
Coe teams' nickname, Let’s think
out this puzzle ior a minute. Exact-
ly what is a Kohawk? I recall pur-
chasing a mug at the Coe bookstore
when i was prospective there.
Their mascot looked something
like a cross between a chicken and
a hawk, so i guess the bright
yellow and orange tones in the
uniiorms are supposed to resemble
chicken getups.

0n the
Schneid

by Eric D. Schneider

A prerequisite for iielding an
athletic team is to have a
nickname. Some schools use
animal nicknames to describe the
type oi play their teams exhibit,
For instance, the Princeton Tigers
are supposed to play with the
iierce strength at a tiger. The
Georgia Bulldogs are supposed to
play as mean as a junkyard dog.
With this in mind, how are the Min»
nesota Golden Gophers or the
Oregon Ducks supposed to play?
Other schools choose nicknames
based on a unique characteristic of
the school. The Oklahoma Sooners.
the Texas Longhorns, and the Ten
nessee Volunteers are all unique
nicknames based on the history of
their states lndiana‘s nickname is
so uniquely obscure that anyone
who can define a Hoosier
automatically becomes president
of Indiana University. The
Midwest Conference is iortunzite to
have a wide variety oi the wild and
the wacky in the world at
nicknames.

Grinnell Pioneers 7 Derived
irom the legendary exploits oi ls.
“l am going west" Grinnell.
Originally. J.B wanted the
nickname oi the school to be the
Congregational Missionary Men.
but alter a nickname symposium
and a student initiative. the school
decided to Change to a nickname
that could (it on a uniiorm, Today
our nickname should be changed to
the Grinnell Tens, so that everyone
will remember our ranking in US,
News and World Report.

Monmouth Fighting Scots 7 It
has been Centuries since the Scot
tish people suited up tor a war.
Where were the iighting Scots in
world war ii, World War 1, or the
100 Years War? The last time l 53 '
a Fighting Scot was at a St
Patrick‘s Day Parade, where
man was cruelly tortured to death
by the obnoxiously shrill sounds o
the bagpipes.
