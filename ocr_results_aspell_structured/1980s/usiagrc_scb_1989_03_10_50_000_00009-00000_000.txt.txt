SCARLET AND BLACK a

The "We are everywhere" graffiti debate

Calls graffiti a counter-
productive tactic

To the editor:

I am writing in response to
Matt Macho‘s article last week,
which denounces Bruce Nissen as
“homophobic.” Mr. Macho
sta s—presumably a minority
opi on among campus homo-
sexuals—that to be supportive of
the struggle for homosexual
equality. one “must be support-
ive, not hostile, to whatever
methods people use to achieve"
such equality. The problem.
Matt, is that you fail to distinr
guish between productive and
counterproductive means. By
writing "We are Everywhere," in

reference to homosexuality, the
author of the w"ting is employ-
ing a counterproductive technique
by alienating those who are ho-
mophobic instead of allaying
their fears. In cssenc;, Matt.
there is an extreme difference be-
tween asking for support for the
homosexual cause and stating
that homosexuals are everywhere.
Mr. Nissen has a valid point and
if you truly wish to further the
homosexual cause you might
wish to reconsider your views in
regard to his article. Geoff
Larson ‘90

it isn't helping the cause

To the editor:

I am writing in response to
Matt Macho’s condemnation of
Bruce Nissen’s opposition to the
“We are everywhere" graffiti.
Mr. Macho seems to hold the
following opinions:

1. That it’s OK for his par-
ticular group to break the law
because of past suffering they
have endured.

2. That anyone who does not
blindly and thoughtlessly endorse
every single tactic of the gay-
rights movement is a
“homophobia." -

3. That not allowing or not
condoning vandalism by a panic,
ular group constitutes
“oppression” of that group.

Mr. Macho is incorrect in all
of these areas. Mr. Macho, if not
approving of your graffiti makes
me a "homophobe," so be it. Ifl
can't be considered a supporter of
gay rights ifl don‘t believe the
right to break the law is among
the “rights" that group should

possess, then fine. I will never
again claim to be a supporter of
gay rights. You “win."

And Mr. Macho, I don’t .tp-
prove of vandalism for ANY
cause; not pro—life, not anti-boy-
cott, not Waldo jokes. and not
gay rights Your graffiti isn’t
helping your cause in my eyes,
and neither is your eagerness to
point a finger and scream
“homophobe.” Perhaps some in-
dividuals on this campus will al-
low the threat of being called a
"hoinophobé" blackmail them
into a blind support of your tac-
tics, but I am not among them.
and I‘m not the only one.

Call me a homophobe if you
wish. After inferring your
definition of the label, I find that
I’m not terribly wounded by its
application.

And watch out for those
“obnoxious fish in a barrel." they
bite. Michael Kent

Attacks Macho's "logic"

To the edition
As a member of the Grinnell
College community for several
years. I have long been exposed
to Mr. Macho‘s wit and piercing
insight into various issues of the
day. Although I have not always
agreed with his views in the past,
I think that on this occasion a
response to the fallacious logic
Mr. Macho used in his letter to
the editor last week is warranted.
Mr. Macho committed his
first fallacy when he claimed that
because Mr. Nissen denounced
the gay-oriented chalk graffiti but
did not denounce publicly posted
paper announcements, therefore
Mr. Nissen was in fact homor
phobic. From the logical

Says Macho

To the editor:

I am writing in response to
Matt Macho’s letter published on
March 3, 1989.

I believe Mr, Macho missed
the point. His poorly thought»
out statements show many ﬂaws
in his logic. Mr. Nissen and
others like myself are not against
homosexuality but against graf-
fiti. Just because there were
minimal amounts of graffiti be-
fore does not constitute that more
was needed or acceptable. I’m
sure the people responsible for
this would not appreciate others
coming in their rooms and write

 

Macho and Nissen call for

future campus unity

To the editor:

We are writing this letter to
the campus jointly after having
talked considerably about the dis
pute raging on campus (and be-
tween the two of us) in order to
clear up many misconceptions
people seem to have about the
issues Our opinions. we’ve dis-
covered. address two distinct and
uncomparable topics (vandalism
and lesbian/gay rights). We hope
the fact that we were able to talk
to one another and come to a
constructive agreement will serve
as an example to the rest of the
campus community that we need
not be divided by hostility.

To begin with. neither of us
intended to provoke hostility in
any way. We have both seen
pcoplc become extremely angered
by this debate, and we feel that
much of this anger is due to
misunderstanding.

Much of the misunderstand
ing seems to involve Matt's
comment that “to be a supporter
you must be supportlvc . not
hostile to whatever methods peo-
ple use to achieve this goal."
Taken out of context, this Slater

ment can be read to mean that
supporters of a particular cause or
group must support whatever that
group does to achieve their goal.
which is not its intended meanr
ing. Rather. the point being
made is that people who wish to
be supportive should try to be
active and constructive, either in
their support or in their criticism.

We disagree as to whether or
not the “We are everywhere“
chalkings are vandalism, but we
do agree that this particular graf-
ﬁti is being unfairly singled out
for condemnation. Seeing “We
are everywhere“ written on ARH
may make you react with hostil—
ity, but why 7 Do you react
the same way when you see
“BCM” written on the loggia?
What did you feel last year when
“You are llcre" was written on all
the tombstones and doors? Think
carefully as to whether your reac-
tion is to the act of vandalism or
the message conveyed.

Don't allow debate over the
graffiti itself to obscure the rcal
issue at hand. The graffiti is in;
tended to make people aware of

the presence of gays and lesbians
on campus and to make the stu-
dent body think about gay issues.
not provoke confrontation and
hostility. if you believe this is
not a positive way to advance
this cause, what alternatives do
you have? Be aware of the diffi-
culties of getting this issue to the
people who most desperately need
to hear it: GLGA docs study
breaks in the dorms and holds
many open meetings. but these
gatherings are often avoided by
the people on campus who most
need to be reached. It is much
easier to avoid a gay issue and
condemn it in the abstract than it
is to confront the issue in the
form of real people, or ask ques—
tions to come to an intelligent
decision. If you have any con-
structive suggestions on how to
pursue this goal, please contact
either of us.

We hope the campus will
cease to divide itself on this issue
and instead come together to deal
with topics the graffiti meant to
publicize. Bruce Nissen,

thought processes displayed in
this argument it would also be
possible to claim that because
person X hates Mongolian beef
but s/he does not criticize other
Dining Service dishes, therefore,
person X hates Mongolians.
Leaving aside, however, the
question of whether or not Mr.
Nissen is homophobic, the part
of Mr. Macho‘s argument which
I found to be the most illogical
was his claim that “to be an ef»
fecrivc ally or supporter, you
must be supportive, not hostile
to whatever methods people use
to achieve this goal." It is “logic"
such as this which justifies such
actions as the Ayatollah Khomev

"missed the

ing on their walls, even if it can
just “wash off.“ I have and will
continue to oppose all grafﬁti, no
matter what it says. This cam-
pus is my campus, too; I don't
wish to see it defaced.
Furthermore, I don‘t under-
stand the logic behind these mes-
sages. If gays/lesbians, as one
message claimed, “are not a spe-
cialsinterest group" then why '
sist on acting special in advertis-
ing gay/lesbian interests by
defacing property and defying
college rules? As Mr. Macho
points out, there are rules in so;
ciety that are oppressive to
gays/lesbians, However, chalk
grafﬁti is not an effective method
of changing those rules. More
over, if gays/lesbians really are
“everywhere," then it would seem
that their “omniprescnce” would
eliminate the need for advertising,
especially at a college as enlight-
ened as Grinnell. If the goal of
gays/lesbians is to be accepted as
mainstream, then why act out of
the mainstream to try to achieve
it’.7 In addition, the graffiti is not
bringing in any support. but
rather has created dislike on cam—
pus that wasn't there before. I

' doubt that this is the purpose of

ini ordering the death of Salman
Rushdie, prorlifers blowing up
abortion clinics, terrorists shoot-
ing Olympic athletes, or home»
phobes practicing gay-bashing
In the long run, to claim that any
action is permissible on behalf of
a "just" cause is more likely to
hinder the cause than to help it.

I suppose it is possible that
as a result of this criticism of
Mr. Macho‘s argument I will be
denounced as a homophobic pile
of smegma. but if that is to be so
then let it be. I have always
thought that such reactions reveal
more about the reactor than the
rcactee. Stephen C. Stur-

these messages.

What is even more disturbing
is Mr. Macho's attack on and la-
beling of Mr. Nissen. The
statement that “to be an effective
ally or supporter, you must be
supportive, not hostile to what-
ever methods people use to
achieve this goal" is some of the
most insipid thinking I‘ve ever
heard. If Mr. Macho went around
killing people or doing other
harm to forward his cause. then is
he saying we should support
this? Does disagreement on
methods make someone an en-
emy of the ﬁnal goal? And why
is he labeling those who aren’t
blind followers as having
”homophobia"? I had hoped that
irresponsible labeling and stereo-
typing of people because of their
differences would be something
that Mr. Macho would be
against. I guess I was wrong.

As I've stated before, I am
not against homosexuals. but I
am against graffiti seen around
campus. I may not be popular
for giving my opinion, but at
least I've done it through a proper
forum. Ijust wish others would
do the same. Travis C. Pol-
