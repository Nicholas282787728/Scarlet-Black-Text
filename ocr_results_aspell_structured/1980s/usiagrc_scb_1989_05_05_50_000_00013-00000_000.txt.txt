A Clockwork Orange:
don't miss the point amid

thevmayhem

by Matt Macho

This is Smnley Kubrick’s
adaptation of the great Anthony
Burgess novel. The novel is
about a young punk named
Alex who‘s a true sociopath,
He goes out with his gang to
have fun, doing
“ultraviolencc”. which is the
really hip activity for the
young folks at this time. After
a full night of assault, robbery.
rape. and assorted mayhem,
Alex particularly likes to go
home and masturbate to
Beethoven's Ninth—real hor-
rorshowr

Betrayed by his gang, Alex
is captured by the police and
put through a rehabilitation
program known as the Lu-
dovico technique, which makes
him incapable of commiting
violence. But then all his pre-
vious victims come back for
revenge, and while littic Alex
was quite the fighter in his
prime, there’s nothing he can
do now that his brain‘s all

. funny, like. The resulting
scandal makes the government
reverse the technique, making
him a psychopath once more.
As the film ends, he’s listening
to the Ninth once more, Lhe old
fantasies of violence returning
once more. “I was cured, all
right” is the last line of the
film.

While the film is excellent,
there are some major differ-
ences between it and the novel.
Alex is made older, around 19
or so, whereas in the book he's

an adolescent, Alex is pre-
sented somewhat more sympa-
thetically, also For example,
in the film he picks up to
young girls and has sex with
them, whereas in the novel the
girls are much younger and
Alex rapes them. While Alex
is without a doubt a total psy-
chopath, there’s also no doubt
that he's the most likeable
character in the film, even
more so than in the book
Most importantly, the ﬁlm is
based on the American edition
of the novel,

The book’s American edi-
tion cut out the last few Chapr
ters Burgess wrote. In these
chapters, Alex is again a ma—
niac, but he's getting bored
with ultraviolence and starts
thinking about settling down
and accomplishing something
with his life. Thus the novel
presents a statement about
freedom and choice which tran-
scends the mindless violence of
Alex and his gang of Droogs.
This is still an imponant mes»
sage of the film, but its less
readily apparent.

Be warned that the film is
EXTREMELY violent and
likely to upset the squeamish
just as it satisfies true gluttens
for mayhem. Don't let the ac
tion distract you from the
message of the film, however.
