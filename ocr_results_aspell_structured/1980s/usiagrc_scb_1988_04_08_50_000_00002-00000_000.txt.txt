EDT/runoff is by far the most
widely used wordrprocessing
package: ill.7 percent of students
use EDT frequently. When asked it

programs at Grinnell are “OK."
64.4 percent of students responded
that they are usually satisfied
when presented with a list or
advanced-editing options. such as
tables (linerdrawingl, list»
processing, or column-editing.
however, a fairly consistent to to 50
percent of EDT users responded
that they would llke to learn to use
these options. For eaample. of
EDT users. 59 percent feel that in-
clusion of footnotes in the paper
should be easier, 57 percent want
to learn how to include graphics in
the test. and 54 percent want to
learn to use foreign characters in
testediting,

Massll users constitute a much
smailer percentage of the student
body: 45.3 percent of students have
had some exposure to Massll. but
only 4.3 percent use the packagc
"often" or "very often." Massll
users are considerably more
computerrliterale than other users
and are most likely to know how to
use advanced wordprocessing
[unclions In addition. they arc the
most satisfied with the power of
the package itself. The most
mentioned problems with Massll
were lack ot printing lacilities and
conflicts with VAX users.
