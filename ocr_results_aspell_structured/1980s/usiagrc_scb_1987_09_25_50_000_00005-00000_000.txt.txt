Sylvie Fournier,
French ,
language ass1stant

by Cindy Jones

Life is hardly a leisurely sojourn
for Sylvie Fournier, Grinneil’s new
French language assistant; her
hectic schedule includes teaching
10 hours of Fre .. a week in addi-
tion to her studies oi German,
American politics, and tennis, Yet
Sylvie says, “I enjoy being here in
the United States, and also I like
the university system.” Her duties
include French conversation
hours, language lab, and an inforr
ma] conversation hour for more
advanced students. Sylvie must
coordinate her language lab with
Classroom instruction, but, She
says, “As tar as my French con»
versation hours, i am pretty tree to
choose what I We’lnt,H

Sylvie comes from central
France, in the country near
Limoges, an area famous for its
china. Her parents own a large
iarm with cows and sheep, and her
two younger brothers are current
ly doing their military service. “In
France, it is required that the men
do'one year oi [militarylservice,"
said Sylvie. During high school,

Sylvie Studied math and received a
bachelor’s degree in mathematics.
However, she studied an array oi
subiects in college. “When i- went
to college I took English, German,
Spanish, and Russian because i am
really interested in languages.”
She graduated from Clermnnt-
Ferrand University last year.

When asked her reasons for com-
ing to Grinnell, Sylvie replied, “I
wanted to come to the United
states. i applied at my university
ior a teaching-assistant position in
the United States. but I didn‘t know
where." Later, she received a let-
ter asking her to come to Grinnell,
Because in France there are not
many job opportunities involving
travel to the U.S., SyIVie was not
sure She would be able to come to
the United States if she did not take
Grinnell. She said, “I didn‘t know
about Grinnell, but now I am quite
happy to be here,"

Students adjust
to life in corn country

by Julie Slivinsky

Adjusting to being away irom
home is a challenge ior many Grin
nell freshmen. For one outoi every
l0 ireshmen this year, however,
that adjustment is made even
more diiiicuit because they are
thousands oi miles from their
iamilies and hometands in all, this
year’s ireshman class includes 33
international students. the largest
number oi international students
ever in an entering class.

How international students iind
out about Grinneii is oiten a
mystery to American Grinnell
students, who are accustomed to
explaining Grinnell‘s location to
other Americans. According to
Mitsuo Yamada, a junior transier
student irom Japan, “All liberal
arts colleges in the United States
have good reputations [in
Japan]."

With help irom his counselor,
Yamada narrowed choices last
year down to Reed College in
Oregon, and Grinneli, Yamada
said that Reed's reputation ior
academic intensity ultimately lnr
iluenced his selection. "I heard
that students in Reed study too
hard. so i chose Grinnell.”

other international students, in»
cluding Ashish Gupta oi india and
Koen Alexander oi the
Netherlands, cited Grinnell's
generous iinaneial aid as a reason
ior enrolling. “My counselor told
me about Grinnell because Gri »
nell has a lot oi money behind it,"
said Alexander.

All oi the students interviewed
agreed that there is more studying
at Grinneil man at home. Said
Yamada, ”It is diiticult to get in
the tiapanesel university, but
once you get in, it's easier. in Grin~
hell we are required to work more
than in Japan, We don‘t have much
homework in Japan,”

intense ,

Eric Chen, a ireshman from
China (PRC), agreed. “it is very
intense here, In China the competi-
tion is intense, but you don"t new
to study until 10 or it at night like
here. This is a competitive school
that way,”

Gupta concurred: ”I study much
more here, four times [as much] at
least. But if you study. you can do
it."

Alexander contended that
"there's a lot more reading here.
That's not the way I like it,”

None of the students found all
justing to lite in the United States
too difﬁcult. “i like it a lot Here
I've come to know quite a few peer

ple. It’s easier to make iriends,,,.
I'm never bored at Grinnell,” said
Gupta,

relationships

Yamada iound little diiiiculty to
adiusting to living in the dorms
because ”my high school was a
boarding school, so I'm used to it.
with English, there is sometimes
some trouble, but students on the
iloor are very iriendiy, People are
very kind.“ He added that “in the
United States, social relationships
are less complicated. I lost much
more tree as tar as relationships
among people are concerned."

televisum

Several students credited lelevl»

sion with making the transition to
America easier. Said Yamada,
“Nowadays we have a lot oi intore
mation about the United States
irom television. So iar I have not
had any shocking experiences. We
are quite iamiiiar with United
States cuiture...but i was impress
ed with the corn iields here."

Alexander agreed: “Dutch
society is iairiy similar to
American society, and the things
that are not similar you have seen
on TV beiore.... i don't have any
trouble here talking to someone.“
Gupta. too, said, “This is exactly
what i thought."

Chen had a diiierent expectation
oi America: "When i was in China,
i thought America was a very rich
country. But when i came. the peo~
ple are the same as the people in
China. Except, i like the people
here because they are open
minded,"

As tar as parties at Grinnell, the
students were satisiied with social
iiie in iowa. Even though Aleltr
ander described himself as “not a
person who goes everywhere in
town,” he admitted, “I've been to
the Bar." Chen and Gupta, too, like
the parties. Even though Gupta is
irom New Delhi, a city much
larger than Grinnell, he said, “Be-
ing in the college is as much fun as
being in the city."

Yamada did have one particular
complaint: “The beer in iowa is
too thin and it contains less
alcohol. But,” he said, “1 will soon
become accustomed to it."
