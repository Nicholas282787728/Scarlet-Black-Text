The slaughter slarls again

The harp seal hunting season fast approaches us for the ump-
teenth time since people began hunting in the Newfoundland area.
This year, as in years past, we will see pictures of these beasts, pic-
tures which will appeal to our maternal instincts to save all babies
regardless of species or breed. However, more concrete reasons to
save the harp babies exist, deeper issues than the “cuteness” of the
animals themselves.

First, why are the seals such a problem? Hunters kill hundreds of
different species each year across me globe. But in this case the
seals are killed when they are less than three weeks old, too young to
escape the hunters. Since these babies get slaughtered by the
thousands, 100,00 last year alone, few reach maturity. Each year the
harp seal population dwindles further and each year the hunt com-
mences during the bearing season. ‘

Who benefits from the slaughter of the seals? The hunters and
their families obviously. Wrong. The hunters kill only for the
valuable pelts; little of the seal, if any, provides nourishment for
hungry humans. Even if the seals were harvested for food 100,000
wouldn’t be needed by the Newfoundlanders. The area itself is one of
the most depressed regions of Canada. The hunters are mostly off-
season fishermen out to make a buck. But three-fourths of these men
receive less than $200 per season, according to the Canadian govern-
ment.

So what is the purpose of all this needless violence and who really
profits? Seal furs go to those who can afford to pay for them, those
who‘ want to sport the latest in chic clothing. The bulk of the revenue
goes to the big ship owners and the companies that turn the skins in-
to finished fur products.

Greenpeace, a non-profit environmentalist group dedicated to the
plight of many endangered species, has already made strides
toward ending the slaughter. As a result of their efforts Congress
passed a joint resolution condemning the hunt, the government of
Italy banned the importation of harp seal pelts, the Frankfurt Fur
Auction now declines to handle harp pelts, French labor unions
refuse to work with the pelts, the demand for harp seals decreases
yearly and the price of the pelts continues to fall.

Unless we support this and other organizations, the seal hunt will
again begin on March 10, By failing to respond we allow a minority
to decide how many of these babies must die. In our silence another
animal slowly joins the platypus in oblivion, all in the name of
fashion.
