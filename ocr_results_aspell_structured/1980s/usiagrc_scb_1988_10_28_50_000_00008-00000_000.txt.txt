Soccer's brilliant season

_ comes to a close

by BobLifton
Sometimes one game
makes all the difference in the
world. One little, bitty loss can
tarnish an entire season. regard-
less of how many victories a
team manages. The men‘s
soccer team finished the year
107371. the best record in Grin-
nell's illustrious history (quit
chuckling; that's no small [eat
as we've had some fine soccer
teams through the years). But
that one loss to Knox, H) in
overtime mind you, shattered
any dreams of nationals. If the
script could only be rewritten...
Yeah, I know, the "if" word
is taboo when it comes to
sports. Hindsight and athletic
events just don’t mi kinda like
Dan Quayle and telligcnce.
And yet, there‘s always an every
lasting desire to plug it in . at

least for personal satisfaction.
There are even those special
times when the "if" word makes
everything more logical, albeit
pure fantasy.

For example, we have the
"definite if" statement: If the
Oakland A's were given a sec-
ond opportunity at a World Se-
ries' ring, with Eckerscly throw-
ing a slider to Gibson instead of a
fastball, they would have
crushed the happy-go-lucky
Dodgers. Or, the "impossible
if": If Robin Givens married
anyone other than the heavy-
wcightchamp, she would have
been a loving, caring, altruistic
wife. Unprovable yes, but also
undeniable. Hence the beauty of
hindsight.

More importantly we hav
the "highly probable if clause":

If the Pioneers had beaten the
Siwash, there is a very good
chance that their season would
still be going. But they weren't
so fortunate, and aren’t making
the big Lrip to nationals.

That‘s perfectly acceptable,
though. Sure, it would be great
to re-write history and give our
Pioneers an unblemished record,
and as long as we're dreamin', a
national title trophy would -fit
just fine in thc PEC. But
Lhese "superficial" attributes are
completely unnecessary; icing on
the cake only puts on more
calories. They finished with
a tremendous record and de-
serve every bit of congratula~
Lions we can muster.

Eons ago before fall break,
the Pioneers kept their dream
alive of yet another conference
championship. They downed
Cornell 3~1 in what turned out to
be a nail- 'ter of a ball game.
After Austin Simmons "reflex"
header off the goalie's kick, the
Pioneers did not score until the
last remaining minutes of the
match. KJ, Noll and Ian
Lorimer exchanged assists and
goals to give Grinnell an exciting
victory.

Following the heartbreak-
ing loss at Knox (which in
essence was for the conference
championship), the Pioneers
travelled down to Texas to try
their luck. They played very
well, emerging with a win and a
tie.

Dave Monaco‘s second half
goal knotted Grinnell 1-1 with
Trinity University. And against
Texas Lutheran, Steve Fairchild
and Derek Orchard combined to
give the Pioneers a 270 victory.
A vacation to write home about.

Unfortunately, the Pioneers
did not find Iowa's climate so
friendly upon return, ending their
season on anything but an up
note. Their final game against
division one Drake was a
nightmare, losmg 6-0.
Strangely enough. however,
one could not expect much
more against such a formidable
opponent. Goalie Randy Seclcy
said that without a doubt Drake
was the toughest team they faced

The winless Cornell Rams
invaded Rosenbloom field Satur—
day looking more like Notre
Dame than a team which occu-
pics the cellar of the Midwest
conference. Cornell‘s first play
from scrimmage seemed to set
the tone for the entire afternoon
when Chris Lentz ran off tackle
for a 71 yard touchdown. Grin-
nell never seemed to recover from
that initial shock as the Rams
frenzied attack quickly added three
more first quarter touchdowns en
route to a 56-7 victory. Cornell
simply dominated all aspects of
the game, nearly doubting the
Pioneers in total offense 5257
266, and they did not officially
attempt a punt the anirc game.

Grinnell's lone touchdown
came on a fourth quarter, 36 yard
scramble by quarterback Dave
White. White rushed for 141
yards on 26 carries to lead the
Grinnell offense, with the major»
ity of his carries coming in the
second half when he switched
from tailback to quarterback.

On a day which the defense
did not have much to boast
about, there were a few notewor-
thy individual performances.

pass on the Grinnell 5 yard line
which thwarted a Comeli scoring
drive.
While Cornell is obviously
a better team than its record sug-
gests, it is a team which Grinnell
could have beaten, and the unex-
pected rout left the coaching staff
and the players searching for an
explanation. "It's hard to figure
out," said head coach Grcg Wal-
lace. “We had a good week of
practice but we were without our
number one quarterback. That
might have helped fire up a hun-
gry Cornell team and they came
out smokin.'" Quarterback Jim
Wotand was injured in the loss to
Knox the previous Week and did
not suit up against Comelt.
Against Knox, Grinnell
was defeated 27‘24 in a game
which could easily havc gone the
other way. The Pioneers domi-
nated the Siwash for almost the
entire game, but a midrgame de—
fcnsive lapse in which Knox
