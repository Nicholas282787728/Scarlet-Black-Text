It ain’t much, but it is home

by Jen Raymond

There's not much to the place at
first look; the unitiated observer
would never think it a “hip” or
“trendy" spot lor students. But
for so many Grinnellians, The Pub
is life at its bare-bones ﬁnest.

The dark. smelly room
underneath Quad dining Hall is
not one oi the features ol the col-
lege trumpeted so proudly in Grin-
nell recruitment brochures. Its
walls are blank except for a cour
pie oi posters and a large painting
that looks like a big stain, It is not
wellrventilated, so cigarette and
beer odors linger in it and get car-
ried home in the clothing and hair
of patrons. The few tableclothes
leit always seem to need launder-
ing. many oi the barstools have
torn seats and several tables 7
having seen duty as makeshift
dancing platiorms — wobble
prccariously under the weight oi
careless elbows.

Yet to scores of confirmed “Pub
Rats". those diehard loyalists
who return nightly to their sanc-
tuary. The Pub is a way oi liie It
is a place to escape books. papers,
tests and general academic
drugery. It is a place to meet
triends. to wind up an evening or
to start one on,

One oi the most pleasant
aspects about the place is that
anything goes. Some people enjoy
dancing in the corner by the
jukebox. other sometimes sing
along to the songs. some do
homework or play board games
and others preier just to sit and
watch everyone else. And nobody
gives anyone else any trouble
there; it's strictly hassleriree.

The social dynamics of The Pub
arc iascinating. Although nobody
would consider it a “meat
market” — mostdorm parties are
more sexually charged than the
average night at The Pub , many
Pub Rats sit with a View of the
door, partly to see who's coming
in alone and partly to see who‘s
leaving with whom.

Fortunately. The Pub isn’t a
place where men wearing op-
pressive cologne and jewelry ask

women who have come dressed to
killii they can buy them a drink A
more typical Pub courtship ritual
usually involves people who are
dressed similarly. in Jeans and
t-shirts. drinking from a pitcher of
beer that someone else has
bought. This rutual is also typical
behavior oi a group oi iriends sit-
ting around having iun, As a
result. it's hard {or the untrained
eye to tell the difierence between
people having a good time and
people looking tor a good time
Most seasoned Pubbers, though,
are able to have a good time
Without looking lor It.

My personal experience With
The Pub began in the second
semester oi my ireshman year. I
was the sports editor on the
Scarlet and Black and our weekly
stall meetings were held there
during Friday Happy Hour. This
was during the Heyday of Friday
Happy Hours. which have decline
ed in popularity over the years,

Gradually. I supplemented my
Friday aiternoon business trips
with weekend viSits, Since I lived
in Norris Hall and rarely ventured
south or the Forum. going all die
way to The Pub was still a big
deal,

i lived in Norris again my
sophomore year but many oi my
friends had moved to South Cams
pus. i grew more accustomed to
the South Campus dorms and, of
course, The Pub. I also started
making weeknight trips down, a
wonderfully bad habit that would
eventually make my senior year
much more enjoyable.

in my junior year I was oi’I~
campus {or one semester but
when I came back i was given a
South Campus room overlooking
the Pub entrace. I was editor of
the paper by then and knew that I
shouldn‘t spend much time‘at The
Pub, but i did anyway.

I often was there with people in
the class above me. so I was able
to practice my “sullen Senior"
image, counting down the days
over yet another pitcher. i also
think it is noteworthy that of last
year’s Phi Beta Kappa winners,

roughly one-third were Rub Rats.

This year I've gone oii the deep
end, You can count on one hand
the number ol days that I was not
at The Pub when it was open I've
spenl more money this year on
beer than on books I even went to
Mexico with the Pub manager and
another friend, hiinsell a hard
core Pub Rat. it you ask inc iil
have ally prohlcms because oi my
propensity to Pub L' also a
verb). I'll tell you yes: have pro-
blems because The Pub isn't open
on Sundays

when I'm sitting around years
irom now reminiscing about my
college days, I don'l think I'll miss
The Pub too much, I can drink
beer. talk to iriends. play pinball
or watch “Hill Street Blues" at
lots of places, But I don’t think I'll
ever [ind a place as comfortable,
as convenient or as casual as The
Pub. And I'll never have the peo-
ple that The Pub has seen in the
past {our years to hang out With.

I guess what it boils down to is
that in letting go of The Pub. i'm
letting go oi almost everything hat
has come together here at Grins
nell to make the past iour years so
unbelievably special And that
hurts a little.

MakiEFamily Life

London, done my major diiierently, and I
would have changed a lot oi litﬂe things
that don’t really matter much now but
really did back then,

Ken Coyle: Never would have taken Ger
man. Not lived in Mr Kissane's house. It‘s
wrecked wiui water,

Brenda Baum: I would have taken some
different classes. I would have gotten in-
volved in some activities. I would have
partied more and studied less; I also pro-
bably would have llunked out. too.

Amy Moulton: In my iirst three years I
would have partied more and studied a hell
of a lot less,

Marian Bothwell: lwouIdn't have laugh-
ed so hard the first time I saw Dave
Petersen naked, Oh Well, no big deal.

Lisa Meeden: I would have danced more
and been even more oi a geek.

Kevin Rhodes: I would have taken part
in more GnoMountalnvrelaIed activities.

Mary Ann O'Connor: Iwould have slept
with more black men.

Randy Cochrell: I would have come out

pearance is believed to have inspired the cieation oi Burliug
