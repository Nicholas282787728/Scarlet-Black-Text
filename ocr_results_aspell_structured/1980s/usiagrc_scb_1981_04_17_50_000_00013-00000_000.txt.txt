Point/ Counterpoint: The Electoral College

Dave Molllo

After each election the argument on
whether to abolish the Electoral Col-
lege or not resurfaces. The critics of the
College have three major complaints
with the system: 1) that it is possible
for the candidate who loses the popular
vote to win in the electoral vote; 2) that
the constitutional provision for a con
tingency election in the House ol
Representatives is lrightening and un-
fair: 3) that there is potential for an
elector not to cast his vote in the way he
was elected to do.

In no case in our history has the Elec-
toral College not elected the man who
was the undisputed popular vote win
her. Characteristic of surface
arguments against the College is the
Tilden-Hayes election of 1876, It is true
that Tilden, the Democrat, won the
popular vote with a percentage oi 50 93,
But the election was hardly a tree one.
Fraud, intimidation, riots and murders
were the circumstances surrounding
the election.

By proposing minor and imaginary
shirts in the popular vote between the
two leading candidates in 16 close eleCr
tions, critics assert that the College can
elect the loser oi the popular vote. This
argument tails because it abstracts
from political realities whereas the
electorate casts its votes in separate
statewide elections, states are not
soundprooi rooms where candidates
can make special pleas that will not be
heard in other states. This shiftrln-votes
argument relies on manipulation or
numbers rather than voters It is one
thing to shift numbers from one column
to another in a political vacuum; it is
quite another to move voters lrom one
candidate to another in the world of
political realities.

The nation has not had a House elec»
tion in 150 years. The reason tor this is

the fact that the unit rule converts
popular vote pluralities into electoral
majorities and thus magnilies .the
margin of victory. The danger at a
deadlock due to a mird or fourth party
movement is exaggerated. Unless a
factional or minor party candidate can
win statewide pluralities he cannot pre
vent one of the two major party can-
didates from winning and the House
contingency procedure will not be in-
voked, since lszd there have been 12
elections in which a third or fourﬂl pars
ty candidate has won more than one
percent or the vote. In every case the
plurality candidate won a decisive Vic-
tory in the Electoral College.

Our electoral system discriminates
against ideological extremists and sec-
tional parties because these minority
voters are restricted by state boun~
daries irom combining thelr votes.
There are many separate wills and in-
terests throughout the nation which
must be molded into political ma-
jorities, not just arithmetical ma~
jorities, and that is a difficult job mat
must be done by the two major political
parties. .

No "lalthless elector" has ever af-
fected the outcome of an election. Bet-
ween the founding oi the nation and
1981 out of 18.124 electoral votes cast
only eight have not been cast for the
candidate the elector was pledged to.

The argument tor retention oi the
Electoral College rests on the belief
that political institutions are intimately
related to the environment in which
they exist and upon the Aristotelian
principle that viahle governments are
not created in the abstract or by fiat but
are rather, organisms that grow out of
the environment in which they are
created.

It is best to judge an institution by its
practical eiiects. The Electoral College
has never lailed to [ill the office of
president of the United States.

in the years without a presidential
campaign the debate over the Electoral
College's legitimacy seems, to most of
us, unimportant, Yet who can deny that
the mechanism which chooses the
president of the United States isn't
crucially important to our notions oi
"freedom" and. in our nuclear age, to
our very survival?

Most voting Americans are vaguely
aware that, under the Electoral Col-
lege, there is a mathematical posslbillr
ty that the president 7 as selected by

the Electoral College 7 may not be the
candidate who won a majority ot'the
popular vote. During the 1930 campaign
a variety ol bizarre scenarios were ex»
amined in which John Anderson's cana
didacy could throw the election into the
House oi Representatives. With the
passing ()1 the 1930 election and Ronald
Reagan's "landslide" victory — “land-
slide" only because oi another bizarre

i twist of the Electoral College in which

the electoral vote multiplies the margin
oi victory lReagan won only 51 percent
of the popular vote but garnered on per-:
cent at the electoral votel e we once
again can sigh in reliei that the
prelerences of a majority of American
voters weren't thwarted by 538 electors:

The Electoral College remains today
as an anachronistic menace with
unknown consequences because the
writers of our Constltution did not com»?
pletely entrust the selection of the
president to the people. The Electoral
College is undemocratic. dangerously
footed in the myth oi "states' rights"
and, thereiore, should be replaced by a
direct election process.

Despite the arguments 0! ultra-
conservative southern and western
senators who continually doom any
Electoral College reforms, the
"winneriake-all" system allotting all
of a state's electoral votes to the can-
didate who has a plurality within that-
state benefits the more populous states.
Normally states which are relatively‘
sparsely populated are dominated by a
single political party, conversely;
populous states tend to have more coma
petitive political parties, Because oi
this, presidential candidates not only
campaign more in populous states
because of their number of electoral
votes but because it's in these states
that a relatively tew number oi voters
can swing the entire electoral block of
their state, Clearly, this favors
“marginal" populous states at the ex-
pense oi one party, rural states and,
although one could argue that
benefiting larger states at the expense
of smaller states is desirable, the
underlying notion or state and regional
identities which supercede a national
commitment to majority rule is distur-
bing. Sectional interest, often to the
detriment of the "national" interest,
ls well incorporated into the congres-
sional fabric.

In an era when political apathy and
cynicism abound, to remove the
vestiges oi an unrepresentative, harm-
in] and, to many Americans, ll-
legitimate lnstitution would certainly
be a welcome iniusion or popular
sovereignty into an ailing body politic,
