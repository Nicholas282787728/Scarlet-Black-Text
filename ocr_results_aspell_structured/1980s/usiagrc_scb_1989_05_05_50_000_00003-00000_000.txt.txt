SCARLET AND BLACK

Student recounts experiences with Polish trade union
Past and present of "Solidarity"

by Gary Jones

I was visiting Warsaw when I
met Jan. I was on spring break
with two other students from the
Budapest program and we had
visited three cities in three days.
Weary from so much travelling,
we wanted to settle down in
Warsaw for the rest of the week.
However, Jan proved to be a very
good ambassador for his home
city. Gdansk. We met him on a
Friday night and by Saturday
noon we had decided to visit
Gdansk. To explain why we
changed our minds so quickly, I
need to tell you a little more
about Jan.

Jan has been involved in
Solidarity for many years. He
was a student leader in the early
‘805 and he helped publish an
underground newspaper. He was
arrested in 1982 when martial law
was declared in Poland and he
spent two years in prison for his
activities with Solidarity.

But things have changed a lot
in Poland since then. The
Round-Table talks between Lech
Walesa and General Jeruzelski are
just one_symbol of an opening
up in the political culture. While
we were in a coffee bar in War-
saw, Jan showed us a Solidarity
newspaper he had helped print
earlier that day. He told us that
just six months ago he would not
have dared to show that newspa-
per in public.

I should emphasize that the
changes underway in Poland are
not occurring everywhere and
some areas are moving faster than
others. During the three days we
spent with Jan we observed vary
ing degrees of reform in Polish
society.

On Saturday we visited the
Solidarity church in Warsaw with
Jan. He gave us pamphlets on
the life and death of father Jerzy
Popicluszko, who was murder by
three members of the Polish
Interior Ministry in 1984.
Popieluszko served as the chap
lain for Solidarity and he was the
priest for the church we visited
from 1980 until his death. Many
Poles consider Popieluszko a
great martyr and they hope he
will become a saint. His grave,
marked by a headstone in the
shape of a cross and an eternal
flame, is just outside the church.
Inside the church there are many
paintings memorializing
Popieluszko; his image is omv
nipresent and very powerful.

After we left the church, we
wanted to visit the old section of
Warsaw. but Jan offered to take
us out to a restaurant first. The
restaurant was very expensive by
polish standards and to make
matters worse, the waiter ovcr-
charged us by 25 percent. Jan

was angry and embarrassed. He
was trying very hard to help us
enjoy our stay in Poland, but this
incident would undoubtedly leave
a bad taste in our mouths. He
argued with the waiter and got the
bill corrected, but this did little to
improve his mood.

The next day we took a
morning train to Gdansk. Ian
had to spend the day in Warsaw,
so he gave us directions to a ho-
tel in Gdansk. Since it was
Sunday, he also gave us tiirec»
tions to the Solidarity church.
Unfortunately, a situation similar
to the one in the restaurant oc»
cured during our train trip and
this time we had to pay extra
money.

The conductor who took our
train tickets seemed to {it many
western stereotypes of the East
European ”bureaucrat." Her facial
expression was somewhere be
tween stern and downright hose
tile, and she talked much louder
than most other train conductors.
When 1 gave her our tickets, she
started saying something in Pole
ish, which of course I could not
understand. I decided she wanted
us to prove that we were eligible
for the student tare, so I showed
her my student card. She gave
the card back to me. said some»
thing in Polish and rubbed her
thumb against her torefingers the
way people do to symbolize
bribery. Then she took our tick-
ets and left for the compartment.

After about ninety minutes
she returned. She had our tickets
and on the back she had written
the regular train fare and the stu-
dent fare. She wanted us to pay
the difference. We knew very
well that we did not have to pay
this, so I pretended not to under
stand. She would point to the
numbers and say something in
Polish and I would shake my
head. It went on like this for
about five minutes until one of
the other students decided to pay

the extra money.

The conductor's countenance
changed instantly; I had not pre-
viously realized that a single fa-
cial expression could convey such
smttgncss. After collecting the
money, she turned to me and said
something in Polish. Of course I
couldn't understand what she said,
but her tone was that of a
schoolteacher lecturing a child.
She had already ripped us off: her
little spcach to mcjust added me
sult to injury and it made me fu-
rious, but their was nothing I
could (it).

Once we arrived in Gdansk.
we found a hotel room and then
we went directly to mass at the
Solidarity church. We expected
that this mass would be no ordir
nary church service and we
weren't to be disappointed. We
are pretty sure we saw Walesa
sitting up front. At the start of
the services, a member of the
choir sang a Solidarity song and
the congregation joined in. They
also made the “victory” sign with
the first two ﬁngers of their right
hands. During the sermon the
congregation applauded fre-
quently. This was something I
had never encountered before.

We had heard that there would
be a speech by Walesa after ser-
vices. A large crowd gathered
ouLside the church and some stu-
dents spokc for a while. Then we
marched about three»quarters of a
mile to the Lenin Shipyards.
Many people in the crowd carried
banners and they sang songs
about Soldiarity and Poland. As
we passed apartment buildings,
people would lean out their win-
dows and wave the victory sign.
Those who watched us from the
sidewalks seemed somewhat be-
wildered by the mass of people
passing before them. When we
reached the shipyards a student
addressed the crowd again. About
lwodhirds of the crowd dispersed
at this point. The one»third who

remained marched back the way
we had come.

That night Jan joined us in
Gdansk and he took us to a pub.
We met some ofhis friends there.
One friend told a few jokes about
the current political situation, for
example:

Why are the RoundrTable
talks being held at a table that is

He waited in line for three and a

half hours and when he got to the
head of the line, the ticket seller
told him all trains to Budapest
were sold out until the first of
May. He convinced them to call
Warsaw and double check on
whether the train we wanted
(April 4) was really sold out.
After about 45 minutes we got
the tickets we needed. If we had
had to get the tickets ourselves.

ters. we might still be in Poland.
