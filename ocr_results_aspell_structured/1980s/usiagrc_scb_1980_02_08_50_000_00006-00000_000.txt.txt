Builds own solar collector

creasing the collector's elliciency.

Another interesting ieatui‘e oi the
unit is the squirrel-Cage tan, About
four times more powerful than a
regular lloor fan, blowers ol this size
can be very expensive. However,
Rausch found his in a catalogue that
sells salvaged equipment. it cost him
512, about a quarter ol the price ot a
new fan. “All you have to do is look
around." Rausch commented. The
whole system, including a 4 x a sheet
or plywood, polyethylene, tan, ther-
mostat. and 5 inch duclwork, cost
about 836.

Although his energy savings have
not been precisely calculated, Rausch
is certain his prototype solar collector
is saving money, His healing bill for
the month of January was less than
$50. an amount lower than his
neighbors’ He pointed out that this
winter has been very mild and clear
so far, and that much harsher condi-
tions will be the real test of his unit,
Theoretically, it is able to contribute
10,000 British Thermal Units (BTU'S)
per hour during peak sunlight periods
<11 a,m.-2 pm).

Rausch‘s plans to increase his coir
lector space and decrease heating
costs are complicated by the design at
his house. The front of the house (aces

would mean “obliterating the tront oi
the house," Rausch explained.

More extensive use oi solar panels
would also require more insulation
and possibly the installation or a heat
storage bank—a column of gravel
through which hot air {lows and stores
heat.

Right now, the construction of addi-
tional panels is being delayed because

oi these requirements. Rausch says he
would build a complete solar heating
system if he could find a house with
more insulation which is correctly
oriented to the sun.

while the construction of one solar
panel does not mean the end of the
hydrocarbon economy, it does
demonstrate that people can help
make the transition to a sunshine
future.

Biopolitics: anthropological interpretation

by Sydney Henlhom

Marvin Potes has been hired by the
Political Science Department [or one
semester. He is currently leaching two
special topics, one entitled “The
American Presidency” and the other
focusing on the field of biopolitics. ‘

Poles received his Ph D. in political
theory from Kent State University,
concentrating in biopolitics He taught

political science for six years at Saint
Francis de Sales College and was later
appointed chairman of the depart:
ment. in addition to his chairmanship,
Poles became interested in college
government and helped to revise the
curriculum structure at Saint Francis

This semester Potes is teaching a
special advanced seminar in the area
of biopolitics. Biopolitics emerged

discipinary concentration, combining
inlormation from the humanities,
biological sciences, and the social
selcnces. This new area‘ or field at
study is oriented toward several divi-
sions. The two main divisions which
Fotes will concentrate on in his course
include the physiological and the
comparative

From the athropologic to the Scienr
tilic, biopolitics interprets the data the
anthropologist mediates in a scientific
manner. Some political scientists tear
that biopolitics represents a danger
throughout the social sciences One
prominent individual stated that
”blopalitics leads directly to the con-
centration camp,” But Potes believes
that this conilict is visible only to a
minority or social scientists.
Biopolillcs shows the dignity of man,
and Poles explained that most
political Scientists do not share the
[ears that others have.

Poles sees his course in biopolitics
as an overview of the comparative
diVlsion oi the subJect, but his main
problem stems [mm the lengthy in-
troductory preparation that is needed
in the course. This seminar is mainly
a lecture series and requires no
papers, since there is a lack oi intorr
mation on the subject here at Grinnell,
