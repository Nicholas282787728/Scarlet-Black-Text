Sophomore faces trial for train protest

On Nov. 28 the
prosecutor‘s office in Concord,
Califomia began the first of four
trials of protesters from the
railroad tracks outside Concord
Naval Weapons Station In the
last of these trials. beginning on
Jan. 9. 1989, the defendant is
Grinnell Sophomore Dan Werner,

The chain of events which
will,end with Werner’s prosecur
tion began in September of 1987.
In that month, Vietnam veteran
Brian Wiltson notified the
authorities at Concord Naval
Weapons station that he and three
other veterans would be sitting
on the tracks to block the munir
Lions train that used them. His
reasons were simple. It was this

train which carried the weapons
that our government sends to the
Nicaraguan contras and the gov-
ernment of El Salvador. Willson
believed that these shipments
constituted an illegal war waged
by our government against the
people of Central America.
Military officials at the base or-
tiered the engineer aboard the train
to ignore the presence of any
person on the tracks and not to
stop for any reason, Willson was
run over, resulting in the loss of
both of his legs.

Since that accident a 24
hour a day vigil has been in place
at the tracks to block the trains.
Werner spent this last summer as
part of that vigil. These days,

die trains stop. But protesters are
arrested. taken to jail. and held
there until charges are
"suspended." Last summer the
prosecutor‘s office lost a very
publicized trial against ”The
Concord 30," a group of
protesters. In the aftermath of
this embarrassment, the prosecu»
tor this fall reinstated charges
against four protesters who had
originally not been prosecuted.

Nuremberg Actions, the
organization which runs the
Concord vigil, justifies its ac-
tions on the basis of international
law. The Nuremberg Principals.
as drawn up by the United Na-
tions, specify "planning,
preparation, initiation, or waging
ofa war of aggression or a war in
violation of international treaties,
agreements, or assurances. . ." as
a violation of international law.
The principals specify that the
fact that a government approves
of or even carries out such action
does not mean it is not illegal
under international law. Finally.
these principals hold that
"complicity in the commission
of a crime . . . as set forth in
Principal V1 is a crime under in-
ternational law."

Werner believes this leaves
no doubt about the criminality of
our governments policies, say-
ing. "Sending these arms is in
direct violation of the Nuremberg
Principals, the Organization of
American States charter. and the
Geneva Accords." If one accepts
Warner's idea that the arms shipr
mcnts violate the OAS. charter
then it is clear that they also
violate Principle VI,
"preparation, initiation or waging
ofa war 1 . . in violation of in-
ternational treaties, agreements or
assurances."

Werner believes that these
principles not only justify his
actions, but also require them.
He said, "In order to not be in
complicity with these crimes you
have to do something about
them." This task has fallen to
individual citizens. according to
Werner because, "The (1.5. has
shown no regard for decisions of
the World Court, using, of
course, the example of the
Nicaraguan harbors." Werner was
referring to the U18. mining of
Nicaraguan harbors. The World

Court ruled against that the mine
ing violated international law,
but the Reagan administration
ignored the decision. Wemcr also
suspects that the prosecutors of-
fice has political motives, "The
hope of the prosecution is to
scare off people from dotng civil
disobedience at the tracks" He,
however, has doubts about the
prosecution‘s chances of success.
"When a person is thrown in jail
for his or her political activities
it publicizes the extent of the
problem that they are fighting.
No matter what happens it Will
be a victory for us," Werner said.

In the four trials the prose-
cution is using a new tactic of
trying defendants individually,
apparently in hopes of convinc-
ing thejury that they acted alone
and not as part of a movement.
Nuremberg Actions is countering
this move by asking supporters
to attend the trials. The Progres-
sive Student Network will be
sponsoring a trip to California
over Winter break to attend the
trials and to block [wins at the
tracks. Corey Hardin of PSN
stated, "By trying to put Dan in
jail they seek to silence the op-
position to Reagan, and in all
likelihood Bush, administration
policies. We are going to the
tracks support our friend and to
show that for evcry one person
imprisoned, five more will be in
front of the trains."

course, developed by staff se-
lected from the entire faculty. It
would be ﬂexible. to allow for
divisional and disciplinary ap-
proaches as well as individual
preference in choice of some
readings. Writing and com—
munication skills also would be
stressed. The second semester of
the model would be "the Crir
tiqucs and Alternatives." The
syllabi would be developed by
various concentrations and pro-
grams. such as women's studies,
Afro~American studies and Chi-
nese studies. The Second
semester would be similar in
structure to the first and possibly
have prerequisites, srnce it may
not be taught in the freshman
year. Both semesters would in-

tions, and Filter public events to
support the core.

4) A ceredistrihution cur-
riculum. Three semesters of for
eign language study at Grinncll
would be required of all students.
Also, more strict distribution re-
quirements would be ilitplee

The distribution requirements
would be: 3) Twelve credits in

The Subcommittee is quick
to point out that Grinnell is now
undergoing curricular review, not
revision. After the faculty re-
views the pros and cons of the
present system and other possible
models. it may decide to stay
with the present structure. It
may also decide to change to a
structure that has not yet been
proposed. Nothing is certain
about the future of Grinnell’s
curriculum. What is certain,
however, is that the time has
come for curricular review.

The members of the North
Central Association site team
that visited campus two weeks
ago to review the college for ac-
creditation gave President George
Drake an overview of what their
final report will say. In that
overview, one criticism they had
of Grinnell was that the college
has gone too long without any
kind chun‘icular review.
