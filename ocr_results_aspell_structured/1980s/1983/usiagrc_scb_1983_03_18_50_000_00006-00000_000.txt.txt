Discovering the best and worst campus rooms

by Jeff Raymond

In 1977 and 1978, the Scarlet and Black
published their list of the ten best and worst
rooms on. campus. Since then, the deperr
sonahzatx'on of the dorms, other wise known as
“renovation" has occured. Thus many of the
best, as well as a few of the worst rooms of the
1970': am now/last memories. The number one
single still exists. It is n phenomenal room, with
windows on three sides, a small, pnuote
balcony, and probably the hrgest ﬂoor space of
any single, not to mention a few double rooms
on campus. Problem is, it's room 100 in Meurs
Cottage. Despite the renovation, many of the
rooms judged among the worst hope the some
dmwbacks as the worst rooms o/the1970’sJVo
light, no heat, no space, no closets, no centim-
tion anda lot o/ roaches are common. complaints
even in renovated rooms, So keep these rooms
in mud during room draw.

Just how bad is bad?

I mean how bad does something have to
get beiore somebody iinaliy says, “Man,
that’s bad! That really stinks!" Something
has to be awlul in order to be singled out
and labeled as “the pits ”

alter Relays is really bad. A life sentance

There 15 only one closet in the room, and
it is frightfully small. The lack of closet
space lends a cluttered appperarance to
the abode. “We just cleaned this place
yesterday," Simon said as he stepped
nimbly over a pile of personal belongings.

The set oi chest or drawers in this room
borders on the antique, and while they
allow a place to put things, they make a
bed area problem worse and iorce at least
one bed to be raised

Leah Watts had the good fortune ol
drawing into a single. It's too bad for her
that she chose room 2023 in Langan pit.
was apparently chooses rooms as some
women choose men: tall, dark and narrow,

The room’s window faces the loggia and
admits little light. It might admit a slight
breeze lor ventilation, but it IS too lar up
lor Watts to open and close easily, There is
only enough room to go irom the bed to the
desk or chest, and roaming about is strict
ly a hallway activity.

The quarry tile floor looks nice, but it is
so hard that according to Watts, “if you
drop something on it, you don't get little
shards of glass, you get dust."

in a Turkish prison is really bad, too.
Likewise, room 302 in James pit is, you
guessed it. really bad

Freshman. Pete Mason and Kevin
Manbeckhave done about all that two peo
ple can do to make this pit in the pit as “11’
miserable as possible. Uniortunately,
there is just not much that can be done
with this terrible mistake of a room.

Designed by a mean architect on acid,
room 302 brings to mind a Set from an lrr
win Allen disaster film. To begin with, it is
simply too small ior two people to live in
with any Acomfort. Mason commented,
“i'm hoping when I'm a junior to get a
single was bigger than this."

There is really no ventilation to speak of,
even witlLthe window open. This lack of
ventilation creates a kind of neat
phenomena: the oven effect, Mason’s therr
mometer (There is no thremostat here,
gang.) read almost 80 degrees on a cold
Tuesday aiternoon this week.

The wind is as good at blocking out
sunlight as it is at blocking out any breeze.
(Pit windows are so grody, t’sure!) As a
result, 302 is a small, dark, hotdouble with
cockroaches. 0h, 1 almost forgot the
cockroachsl Las Cucarachas really go
lor pit rooms. (The insects aren't as big a
problem when the weather warms up the
ground, though, because then the water
seeps through the ground and into the
room, washing out the carpets and bugs.

Mason and Manbeck could have gotten
really homesick in this kind of place and
left, but they were calm and confident and
made the best or what they were assigned.
when they discovered that their desks did
not have shelves, they simply called Bria
and requested some.

So why are the desk shelves now piled in
a corner of the room, adding to the clutter”
Because the shelves are too big lor the
desks, and they haven’t gotten any
replacements yeti Somebody ought to buy
these poor guys a drink,

Tom Gerhardt and Dave Simon of room
6330 of Loose third, live in the second Wurst
room on campus. despite the fact the
Loose is one of the latest dorms to be
renovated The room is in great condition,
but it's one of those places that is smaller
than it looks “There are rooms like these
on second floor,” commented Simon, “but
they‘re all singles."

There is a window set off in an alcove
that serves as desk space, but its place-
ment and eastern face afford little i1»
lumination in the afternoon. This makes
the room perfec‘ for Snoozing, a fact that
has not Esramd the somnolent Gerhardt.

Room 900 in Younker pit is where Rick
Snyder calls home in Grinnell, it's just too
bad for Snyder that his room is, well, ugly,
It has drab walls, a gray iloor. and hurri»
ble yellow tiles along the base of the two
outside walls. _

Room son is fairly big but not all that
well-lit. Maybe the lack oi light is good,
though, because Snyder reported that with
the tile, “It's like living in a bathroom,"

Snyder can't control the heat that con-
stantly pours into the room from the ob
noxiously luud radiator, except by-leaving
the window above it open, The interesting
combination of radiator and window
leaves the room very dry. “I could never
grow anything down here," stated Snyder.
“Guess it keeps the mold away, though,"

An ominous overhand in room 1406 on
Main lourth diminishes space in one or
Main‘s notoriously tiny rooms. Alter clim-
bing all 53 steps up to fourth lloor, Don
Swinscoe and Todd Coulter, who live in
this odd little room, have to cnniend with a
space designed for two people Without any
storage needs. In fact, there is only one
closet in this room,

The overhang negates the light coming
in through a southrfacirig window and
makes walking around the room
downright dangerous. With more space the
roommates might be able to move around
without bumping into each other. “The
SA‘s single on this floor has exactly the
same dimensions as this one,” Said Swinr
cue, Hopeiully, the housing folks will take
that fact into consideration next year.

The astute reader will have noticed that
there are no rooms from Norris included in
the list That's because all the rooms in
Norris are so mindnumbingly similar that
no une room is much worse than any other.

Fourth floor has nice furniture and well-
lit halls, but the rooms are still just
nondescript boxes where people sleep. The
doubles on the other floors are spacious
and well~ventilated, but they are ugly,
unimaginative and predictable. The
Singles in the dorm are all just too small

Norris always seems to receive inor-
dinate amounts of damage. Windows,
doors and hallways get smeared with all
sorts of substances and are regularly
broke The people who live in Norris aren’t
that much rowdier than residents of other
dorms, it’s just that they losr respect for
where they live a lot faster.

According to the recently released hous-
ing pact, Norris will be reiurbished over
the summer, and some doubles will be
designated singles to attract more up-
perclassmen It would have been nice if
they had refurbished Cooper School and
gave Norris the 01‘ once over with the
wrecking ball,

Although me response to the S tr B’s
quationnaire about the best rooms on
campus was small, the sari; was able to
compile the following list.

Ranking has not been attempted
because of the diversity of the room
characteristics, so rooms are listed
alphabetically by dorms.

John Moffet’s room on Clark second is
large for a single; large enough, in lact, to
house a small bar. The bar was assembled
during New Student Days and is popularir
ty (along with Moffet's) was instan-
taneous. The room has a sink, a big closet
wind is real door, and there are two big win
dows that open onto the loggia. It is, accor-
ding to Moffet, great for parties, especially
when the weather is nice.

Another distinction of this room is that it
has been the very first. room chosen during
room draw {or two years running, SGA
praident and vice president automatical-
1y receive room draw numbers one and
two, respectively, as a fringe benefit of
their jobs. Teri Gould, SGA vice president,
for 198171982, had the first room draw last
year because President Doug Rowe chose
to live off campus, and she chose that
room. Moffet drew first this year as SGA
president,

The four person suite on the west side of
Cowles second is another impressive
domicile The suite contains Single
bedrooms, a living room (or lounge). a
bathroom, and direct access to the loggia.
There are four Similar suites in Cowles,
but only the room belonging to Andy
Hamilton, Steve Sprenger, Rob Caldwell
and John Jackson has direct access to the
loggia The residents (and their friends)
seem very pleased with there living arr
rangements. Hamilton noted, “We have
the BEST parties!"

There is little outside noise that bothers
the resident in the suite, though they in
dicated that the suite itself is often quite
noisey. Hamilton Said, “It's isolated, but
we like it. Our noise doesn't bother
anybody," The suites in Cowles are
distributed by group draw, so they are out.-
side of the regular room draw system,

The old RA Suite on Gates first has made
the Scarlet and Black list for the second
time. A similar article in the April 22, 1977
issue rated the suite sixth in a list of the top
10 rooms on campus. Karen Yokoyama
and Nicole Etcheson live there now There
are two rooms, a bathroom and a kitchen.
Usually the suite is drawn as a group coop
for two people. Yokoyama and Etecheson

are, however, on board and moved into the
room at the beginning of second semester,
Athough the room laces the loggia, “There
isn’t too much noise”, according to Et»
chosen

The suite is private and very quiet, part-
ly because there are only two other iloor
members Etcheson seemed pleased with
the suite, especially since she isn't forced
to cook her own meals.

Sue Helgeson and Janice Mineah live in
the old RA suite on Cleveland first. It has
one room, a kitchen and a bathroom.
Helgeson said that the loggia is “really
noisy but we like it " They are both on
board, but the room is usually drawn as a
two person coop.

The two-room triple on Read iirst also
made a previous Scarlet and Black list; in
April ’77 it was rated seventh as a two-
room double, Peggie Bingham, Meagan
Conway and Laura Schaeffer live there
and share the private bathroom. The
rooms are carpeted and fairly large, but
“The loggia noise is awful," according to
Bingham and “The light on the loggia is
pretty annoying.”

One room that deserved honorable men-
tion at least is Denise Walter’s Single in
Clark Pit. It has a sink, two large closets
and two pit Windows facing west, It is also
nicely decorated and furnished

 

The dorm dope

Room draw is coming upﬁsgherclslthe
rundown on what's what, who's who apd
why ibis in each dorm: ,~ /

Clark: Named alter the candy bar, in
habited by a lew football players, a couple
of basketball players, the gall team and
members of the women's group from
Molina, ths dorm celebrates Saturday
night by getting together to watch “The
Love Boat." But then again, who likes
Clark Bars?

Cleveland: And you thought the city was
bad The people in this dorm like 0c-
toberfest and hate the Pub, I mean, how
uncool can you be,

Cowles: Named alter Casino Night, this
dorm has gone through major changes in
the last year — which is like giving a
cadaver a face lift. And the aromas of food
service...

Dibble: Being in between Clark and
Cowles is like gomg to a Ferry Como/Ethel
Merman concert, What a dorm.

Gates: Gates“! This dorm needs cages.
Next year, “those men" return, and you
know what that means If you don't, live
there.

"zines: Better known as “Bong Kong,"
this dorm has the highest Visine use per
capila ratio of any dorm on campus. Wow.

James: This is the most peaceful dorm

on campus... they’re all over at Haines,
This is enact the breeding grounds for
Broad Street, so make sure you’ve got
some sunglasses,

Laugan: Can you imagine staying up un-
til 4 am. to discover that Prof, Plumtree
did it in ﬁle bedroom with the candlestick?
If you can, go visit the dorm ~ don’t live
there. .

Loose: There's a path in front or the
dorm that extends out for about ten feet
and then ends. That's really intense, mon.

Main: The residents of Main have
declared the dorm a “nuclear freeze
zone," so you're safe here. And the aromas
of food servnce...

Norris: “

Read: They misspelled Cliiiord's name
and dedicated a dorm to him But I hear
they’re bringing the Specimens back, I
love 'em.

Smith: The link between Younker and
North Campus. The Cro-Magnon dorm of
Grinnell.

Youilker: why does this dorm always
smell? Either it's the proximity to arm,
Dave Bloom's memory, or maybe the col»
lege likes it that way. Bringa can otGladc.

Quite a group ol dwellings. My advice:
apply for Grinnall House monitor
