Greek musical to open

A new musical version of Aristophanes’
anti-war comedy Lysistrata will be per-
formed on November 10, 11, and 12 in
Roberu Theater. The cast will include 20
men and 20 women in singing parts and
speaking parts.

Lysistrata is a collaboration between
two Grinnell staff members. Babe Voert-
man, Assistant Professor of Theater,
wrote the script for the production and
Barbra Lien, a pianist of the mlslc staff,
composed the score.

Lysistrata is the story of how women in
Greece, during the Pelopannesia Wars
join together and declare a boycott on all
sexual activity until the men sign a truce.
Lien and Voertman said the play has had a

reputation in the past of being dirty, but
that jokes about erections and sexual
deprivation are not taboo today. Lien and
Voertman also said that although the play
makes fun of both male and female sexual
weaknesses, it is [or the most part an anti-
war play.

According to Lien and Voertman, the
music of Lysistrata makes use of Greek
modes consisting of some unusual scales.
They also said that ﬁle music is affected by
both classical and jazz idioms, making the
score b0”) accusible and unusual, The
music in Lysistrata contains iourteen
songs performed by either soloists or the
chorus along with a twelve to fifteen piece
orchestra.

Circle jerks are tubular

The Crow's Nest in Iowa City is the place
in Iowa to see bands which you’ve pro-
bably heard of, but which are not big
enough to play a genuine concert. The live
hundred person capacity club is located at
m South Dubuque Street, and the phone
number there is SIS-3514030.

On Monday, October 31 the club offered
a triple bill featuring The Shy. an Iowa
pop/rock band; Stiff-Legged Sheep, an
Iowa City punk band; and the headlining
act, The Circle Jerks, a hardcore band out
of LA.

The Shy opened the evening and proved
to be a good (though unprofessional) pop
band, but they were playing to the Circle
Jelks' audience, which is the equivalent of
Barry Manilow playing to a Def Leppard
audience. The punks in the crowd were not
interested in this band at all, Their attitude
intimidated those who did appreciate The
Shy from dancing, and encouraged
drunken rednecks to jeer at the band. The
Shy simply ignored the audience, played
their set and left the stage

Stiff-Legged Sheep were next, playing
the top 40 ot punk e “Too Drunk to F's'os”,
“l'm So Bored With the U.S.A.", etc. The
group has been playing together for five
years (which means the members were all
about fourteen'when they started) and has

built up quite a iollowing. This was their
first club date; usually they just rent out a
church basement and play: Their tans
seemed to enjoy them, but the rest of the
audience wasn't interested (except, of
course, the rednecks. who kept up meir
hassling). But the group's mlsic served
the purpose of getting the audience warm-
ed up for hardcore punk, something The
Shy did not accomplish,

The Circle Jerks are a good band, but
their set was not very enjoyable. For one
thing, the dance iloor was about five times
the size it should have been, so that when
people tried to slamdancc they weren’t
pushed together. The crowd wasn't unified
and people ended up slamdancing with
partners like square dancing. Also, there
was no stage diving, partly because to get
up on the stage one had to scale a seven
foot chit, Three people completed “stage
jumps"; instead of trying to catch them,
people just moved out of the way and let
them fall

The other big problem was the crowd.
mostly the rednecks. (By rednecks, I
mean people who wenl to the show to
“check out them punk-rockers”) The Cir-
(:16 Jerks did not ignore their rude com-
ments as the other groups had. They im»
mediately told the hecklers they could

Airflow Deluxe covers a middle ground
between big bands and Dixieland groups,
known as Chicago Style Swing, and
packages it in a theatrical format. The
band is an integrated group or eight musi-
cians and four vocalists.

The vocalists are known as The
Casualaires, a name influenced by the
Glenn Miller Modemaires. The two male
and two female members sing, dance and
do comedy routines,

leave if they wanted. The tension mounted
as the set continued, until finally the lead
singer told one particularly obnoxious
dnink dial he could get up on stage himself
and sing if he was so fantastic. The man
got on stage and made obscene gestures.
The whole audience booed at him while the
band walked on stage. Finally the pro-
moter (who had been sitting on the side of
the stage involved in a deep discussion)
walked Over to the drunk, heaved him into
the audience 7 i was glad nobody caught
this person 7 sat down, and resumed his
conversation,

This proved to be a blessing in disguise.
When the band resumed playing, they
were so disgusted with the whole scene
that they played with an intense anger that
had been missing in their earlier songs.
Thus the audience was exposed to raw
emotion, which is the root of hardcore, and
the band was able to transmit meir energy
to the crowd through their music. Square
dancing ceased; the dancing became a
response to the excitement oi the music
rather than a feeble attempt at doing what
was supposed to be done:
