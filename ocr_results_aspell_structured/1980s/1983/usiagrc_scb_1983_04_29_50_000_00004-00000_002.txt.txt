was GQU According to Drake and Go
representative ’l'ony Nikon. it was ‘love at
first sight.’ “We knew we had a place for
George at the magazine." said Nikon. -

‘ “Tony was such a pleasant person,"
Drake quipped. “He really made me feel
comfortable about getting into the model-
ing business because, gosh, let‘s face it, i
had some reservations about the whole
thing." ‘

Nikon had nothing but praise for the buds
ding clothes jockey. "George simply ex»
udes brio and confidence and youthful
vitality," he beamed.

"In addition. George will oiier a plea-
sant contrast to all those fresh-faced kids
we have now. He‘ll be sort oi a paternal
presence at the magazine. He'll be a calm-
ing influence on all the young twerps in the
modeling corps."

Drake. the everrprophetic visionary, is
already looking past modeling to bigger
and better things. “I want to use my
modeling skills to get me into an acting
career," the pixyrlsh head-honcho admit
ted, “Sure, modeling ivili always be my
true love, but let's race it, acting is where
the big money is,"

When asked what deals he is hatching in
the iiim biz, the cagey Oxford man replied,
“Well, let's just say we‘re talking imr
mense amounts of legal tender " He grinn-
ed a winning grin and refused to elaborate.

Only one thing bothers the usually
unflappable Drake in this story of news

powered world of fashion modeling.
"Gosh, for the life oi me, i can't figure out
who sent a picture of me to that modeling
agency,” he said in an uncharacteristic
display oi utter beiuddiement.

Drake’s secretary, when questioned as
to the origins of the now-famous
photograph, giggled, twirled in her chair,
and cooed, “Isn't he just dreamy?"

Fur flies at faculty forum

by Gary “Biz Hands” Johnson

The formaldehydersoaked walls of
Science 171 was the scene of the latest
meeting of the Grinnell College faculty, I
waited in my seat with pencil poised as
these demi~gods filed in and took their
seats.

Well, the meeting was called to order
and various committee reports were fired
around the room,

The first order of business was a library
matter. The head librarian Christoher
McKee pleaded for more book funds so
that he could increase the number of
volumes currently in the library.

Dean Frazer suggested that McKee
check into the membership benefits of the
Book—ofrthe-Month Club; she thought that
new members could get four books for a
dollar if they joined this month.

The faculty was then informed of two re»
cent developments in the literary careers
of two Grinnell professors:

Chaplain Haas recently received word
”lat Social Distractions has accepted his
article entiﬂed “Would Jesus have been a
good Samaritan if he had gone to Grinnell
College and had lived in a Cowles single
during his sophomore year’!"

Dan Kaiser informed the august body
that he is currently working on a sequel to
his runaway best-seller about law in
medieval Russia. He plans to Call his new
work “Childbirth and Tree Rings in Early
Modern Russia."

Then the meeting began to drag. i noticr
ed that various professors were pulling out
papers and starting to grade them. Some
were filling out recommendation forms for
students. My mind also began to wander: l
wondered why my jeans were biting so
tightly everywhere except in the crotch,

Anyway, some professor made a motion
to add a show and tell portion to the iaculty
meetings. The motion failed for lack of a
second since no one was listening,

Suddenly the door opened and a harried
Mr. Dawson entered the premises. He sat
down next to me and ljust couldn't resist
asking him why he was almost an hour
late, His face immediately assumed a sly
grin and he said, “I'm just warming up for
finals."

 

Coach Pfitsch then raised the issue of the
generally unfit condition of this year's
ireshman class, He suggested that a
fitness test also be done by the Admissions
office before the particular student be ad
mitted. Mr. Hopkins suggested that it
might be difficult to institute such a pro-
cedure into the admissions process,

However, Pfitsch quickly pointed out
that he had seen some actors on the TV
who were demonstrating something called
"The Special K Pinch.” He offered to
demonstrate.“ on MS. Berkowitz and Ms.
Mease for educational purposes.

immediately, Ms. Here and Ms. Babener
jumped up for a point of order. They stated
that this would be sexist and they could not
allow it.

Pfitsch then said that he would gladly
give them the Special K Pinch mo. Both
professors screamed above the roar of
laughter, “But that's not the point!"

Suddenly, a glint came to Mr. Mayer's
eyes. Apparently me cogs were beginning
to turn in his head. As he stared at the ad-
ministrators huddled around the desk at
the front of the room, he fidgeted with his
tie, clicked his heels together, raised his
arm and screamed, “If the Russians don't
get us, the administration will 1”

Then from the back of the room, some
Anthro prof yelled, “Cat fight!” In the
words of D.A. Smith, “Suddenly there was
hair flyin' everywhere “

The other members of the faculty initial-
ly didn‘t know how to react. Everyone was
doing different things Parslow was trying
to form a committee to deal with the crisis.
Jones was looking for a cigarette, Lalonde
was looking ror someone to go with to the
Longhorn, Apostle was giving an unaskedr
for opinion, and Woriey was just staring
off into space.

with renewed determination, Moyer
yelled, “Charge!". and the rest is history.
The faculty descended en masse upon the
administrators

AS the Scarlet and Black is going to
press, the workers are still clearing the
rubble away from the scene, Full details
and plenty oi gory photos will be published
in next week's Scarlet and Black.

Joint Bored
sits idly by

by Billy ‘While Shoes” Johnson

Highlighting last Wednesday’s Joint
Bored meeting was the simultaneous let-
ting of wind by the entire delegation of
North Campus representatives. The gas
passed overwhelmingly

The first order of new business was
delayed while the minutes of the previous
meeting were debated. Loose Hall Presi-
dent Peder Fretheim requested that the
words “Please please me” be removed
and Haines President Pete Hautzinger
suggested that the lyrics to The Who's
"The Kids Are Alright," be included in the
minutes. The minutes were approved
unamended.

A proposed bylaw to limit the number of
bylaws allowed for discussion in one
meeting was not allowed to be brought up
for discussion because of a bylaw that does
not allow new business that does not have
prior approval from the Bylaw Allowance
Committee.

“By not allowing bylaw discussion we
have irresponsibly bypassed an important
bilateral rawnsibility with the students,"
argued OCNO Representative Paul
Bethke.

A motion brought up during new
business that would require the JB
representatives to register vital signs dur-
ing .18 meetings was briefly discussed and
finally tabled because too many represen-
tatives were too busy trying to find their
pulses to vote on the motion. Several JB
members wre unable to find any signs of
life, and were also tabled,

Lance Goldstein, Jr. submitted a request
to initiative Fund Committee for $1,200 for
reireshments at the Nuke and Lay Waste
Kill-In next week, Goldstein indicated that
the funds would also cover the cost of
Wagner's “Ride of the Valkyries" which
would be blared from a portable stereo
placed in iront of the Forum during the
event. JB passed the funding request
unanimously and without debate.

The meeting was adjourned after a ten-
minute silence during which time the
representatives searched for meaningful
activities. (Finding none, the members
swapped partners and went home.

Pro protestor provokes problems

by Johnson and Johnson

Meeting with a number of political at.»
tivist groups on campus last Week, Ken
Bahr, '31, made sure that his visit was
somewhat different than the normal
"alum talks with students” visit.

Bahr, a consultant from “Protest-S ’R
Us." was giving advice on how to get the
most mileage out of a demonstration. The
Scarlet and Black was able to get an inter-
view with “The Angry Capitalist" and the
iollowing are excerpts

8&8: So what is “Protests ’R U57"

Bahr: Well, when a number of friends of
mine and i graduated from college, we

realized that the best thing we could do'

was protest. But carrying a sign around
for 10 hours is not a job for which many
businesses hire We needed to put tofu on
the table, so we started a consulting iirm
to teach others the skills we spent four
years mastering.

5&3: What do you mean the best thing
you could do was protest? Is that all you
did at Grinnell”

' naiir: Pretty much, i was an Ameican
studies major

sac; How did you get into protesting?

Bahr: There was this really cute girl on
my iloor my ireshman year. i wanted to
get together with her in the worst way. One
day I found out she was going to a protest,
Well, that started my career. 1 went to
antirnuke rallies, antirdraft demonstra~
tions I protested tenure decisions, dorm
renovations, and once I even carried a
banner at an El Salvador peace march,

5&3: What was the high point of your
career?

Bahr: I spent a semester in Germany
and marched in a rally there.

5&5: What for?

Bahr: I don't know The leaflets said.
“Frieden den Huten!" and I still don't
know who the Huten are. But i love to pro—

test, and it was in Germany,

soil: So what did you talk aboutwith the
groups here at Grinnem

Bahr: Basically I told them a few tricks
on how to get on TV and what to do when
the camera is pointed in your direction. i
told them ,how to get the CIA and FBI to
open a file on you.

son: Does “Protests 'R Us" offer any
other services?

Bahr: Yes, tor a small iee we'll come up
with banal slogans to put on signs or to
chant. We also have a list of people who'll

protest anything, A real crowd builder.

5&5: Don’t you ever run into the pros
blem of conflict of interest7

Baltr: Nah, most of the time we don't
really know what we’re demonstrating
against anyway. ,

5&3: Would you say your protests are
effective?

Bahr:: That’s hard to say. The enemy is
so closed-minded, They never listen,

5&8: Closedrminded'.’

Bahr: Hey, I’m the first fella to admit
the other guy’s got an open mind, so *long
as he agrees with me.
