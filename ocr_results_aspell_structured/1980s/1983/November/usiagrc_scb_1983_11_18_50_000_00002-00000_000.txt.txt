Kupelnian's Motion

David Kopelman moved to make It a
“main motion,H that requires a tonthirds
vote instead or a simple majority

SGA President Jon Scharff attempted to
expedite the vote by exercising his power
to object and discard Kopelman's motion.
Off-Campus Nonrcollege Owned PreSident
Mike Oman and Dave Knpelman ques
tioned Scharif's objection to Kopelman's
motion.

Gillespie's Motion

Parliamentarian Eric Fisher was quite
urgently needed then.

A majority oi uie hall presidents voted to
overrule Scharfi', and sustain Kopelman's
original motion. Kopelman's motion to re

Gillespie’s motion to abolish CSL passed
on a show of hands,

Gillespie’s motion failed to garner even
one third or SGA support on a roll call vote.

The next item on the agenda was the ap-
proval of the members of the new Commit
tee on Student Politics. Chairman Marc
Lambert's appointees, Dave Kopelman,
Alex Rhoads, Russ Matteson, Steven
Meehan, and Anne Stein, were all approvV
ed after a short period or questioning.

Rowe stressed that while the Pub
receives support from the College in the
form of free space, heating, and electriCl-
ty, there is an outstanding loan for $3,500
because "after the renovation the Pub
didn‘t have enough money to start up."
Referring to the $6,000 for the [acuity club
Rowe Said. “As a student I‘d rather have
my money going to future students."

President oi the College George Drake
viewed the club as a "fringe benefit" and
recognized a need to create good working
conditions. He Said that the faculty is
“underpaid" and equaled the club with
other benefits such as the tuition break for
children oi professors "it's meant to be a
daytime operation," he said. About con
caps that the Faculty House might effect
Faculty-Student relations Drake said,
"That group [of faculty] wouldn't sit
around with students anyway "

Dawson told the Scarlet and Black that
he is concerned with building a sense of
community among iaculiy, and did not
want the club id be seen as a way oi keep»
ing students at arms length He added,
"I'm sure some people will look at it that
way. So be it. Solidarity is not very impor-
tant."

Dan Klatz and 5&3 Editor James Lyons
tried at the close of the meeting to force a
test of Joint Board's credibility with the
studentry, Lyons and Klatz moved to tem-
porarily suspend the SGA bylaw that
prevents a motion from being voted upon
unless it has been placed on the agenda ior
that week's meeting. Klatz and Lyons
wanted to propose a subsequent motion to
poll the studentry for a vote or coniidence
0n the current SGA constitution They
moved that Joint Board suspend the rules
on voting to allow the consideration of a
proposal calling for a student referendum.
The referendum would be a vote of con-
fidence on the current SGA constitution,
including the structure of Joint Board.

“Especially in lightoi this debate [on in-
volvement in national politics], there is
serious question whether government as a
whole represents the students,” said
Klatz.

Klatz and Lyons wanted to move that the
studentry be offered a chance to accept or
reject the new Constitution. “It would be a
maintained Klatz.

The motion could not be voted on this
week under normal Joint Board procedure
because oi a bylaw that requires every
item voted upon to be placed on the agenda
beiorehand Lyons and Klatz moved tosus-
pend that bylaw in order to allow a vote on
their proposal.

That motion iailed. Lyons and Klatz pro-
mise now to “bring it to the students." But,
in Lyons's words, “If they want to live with
Joint Board and its inconsistencies, that's
what they'll get.”

Matteson hoped that the amount of

to demonstrate to the college that this is a

group's goal is to obtain a minimum of $1

per student from at least half of the stu~
dent body. Ultimately, the group hopes to
raise at least [our to five thousand dollars,

Matteson said this iigure won't replace
all the aid lost by students on campus due
to the Solomon Amendment, Applications
will probably be taken to determine how
the funds raised-should be distributed.

The idea for a scholarship fund for
students who lost financial aid because of
the Solomon Amendment was first sug-
gested by Diane Soles at a iorum held by
the Registration/DraIt/C.O Group here
on campus at the beginning of October,
Soles suggested then that perhaps the col-
lege would match the iunds raised by
students dollar for dollar.

This proposal was informally discussed
with the Trustees of the College who were
not open to it. According to Matteson,
"They said that at this point they won't do
anything to counter the Solomon Amend
ment "
