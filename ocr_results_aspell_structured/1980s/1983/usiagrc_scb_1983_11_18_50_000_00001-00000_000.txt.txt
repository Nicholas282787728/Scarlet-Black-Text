Faculty receives $6,000
for drinking club

by Debbie Saeger and lim Bloyd

’l‘he $6000 conversion and renovation of
a college-owned house on 1303 Park Street
into a Faculty club opening second
semester is underway, according to Pro-
fessor of Economics and member of the
Ad-Hoc committee for a Faculty House
Jack Dawson, President Drake Said that
Faculty and Administrators with faculty
standing would be members

The collegeesubsidized club will serve as
a gathering place where [acuity “whose
paths don‘t normally cross can associate
with one another on an informal basis for
coffee, lunch. and meetings," according to
Dawson Dawson hopes the club will im-
prove morale and promote unity among
the faculty.

Student Government Assocmtlon Pi'esie
dent Jon Scharff called the idea
“ridiculous." At a time when money ls
tight “here they are spending $6,000 on a
tun house I can't imagine faculty going
over lust to see each other and have a
drink after after being in class all day." He
also worried about the possibility of
decreasing the opportunities for informal
faculty-student relations

Dawson suggested that the house would

provide a place lor afternoon cocktail
hours. He said that Grinnell House viould
be the local choice for a club, but that it is
usually booked in advance, The location at
1303 Park St, was seen as a plus -~ '
something wc can do at the Forum
Dawson. Dawson added that the Pub was
not conducive to conversation. The club
will not, however, purchase a iiouor
license and iaculty will have to provide
their own alcohol

Pub manager Mitch Rowe said that the
club would have no effect on Pub business,
since “mostly it is student money that sup-
ports the Pub " He said ”It would be a
drag for students," because it could
disunlte faculty and students, “One of the
goals of lhe Pub is to promote good faculty
and student relations When we had
facultyestal‘f week we gave away 45 or 50
pitchers They came because they knew
other faculty would be there We sell $1.25
pitchers to faculty on Wednesday after-

Fund established for victims
of Solomon Amendment

by Ken Scotton

During the past week, students were
asked to contribute to a new scholarship
fund designed to as5lst those studean who
have lost financial aid as a result of the
Solomon Amendment,

The solicitors were a group of students
who started the fund to provide an alter
native means to give financing to those
students who are not registered for the
draft. Solicitations were made through an
all-Campus stuff, at tables in the post
office and outside the dining halls, and
through a dooreto-door drive in the dorms,

The Solomon Amendment states that no
government financial aid will be provided
for those studetns who are required to
register with the Selective Service and
have not done so, The law went into effect
in October,

At least five Grinnell College students on
campus have refused to register despite
losing their financial aid from the govern-
ment.

The group began soliciting lunds in the
Post Office on Tuesday During the first
day, people contributed a total oiabout 375
said Russell Matteson, a member of the
group. This is less than the group had ex-
pected, although Matteson noted that the
number of donations was picking up on
Wednesday.

Matteson said that students should not
be concerned with the issue or registration,
but with the fact that some of their fellow
students may not be able to come back to
the college next semester due to the finane
cial aid that they have lost because of the
Solomon Amendment

“Fund organizers realize that not all
students oppose draft registration, but
they hope that the student body will agree
that those students who choose not to
register still have a right to an education,”
said Matteson.

Nathan Anderson, also a member of due
group, said that the Solomon Amendment

Joint Board voted by an overwhelming

posed by Junior Jim Gillespie to abolish
the newly formed Committee on Student
Politics. Joint Board also voted to confirm
CSP Chairman Marc Lambert's ap-
pointees to the new committee.

in new business, Chairman of the Con-
certs Committee Dan Klatz and $8415
Editor James Lyons proposed a student
relerendum calling for a vote oi cone
fldence on the current SGA constitution
and the structure of Joint Board Klatz and
Lyons plan to organize a petition to force
Joint Board to call a student referendum
on the Current SGA constitution The peti-
tiun must garner 15 percent of the student
body,

Jilii Lyons, EditorineChief Of the Scarlet
and Black and Fred Klatz, chairman of
the Concerts committee, tried at the close
of the meeting to force a test of Joint
Board's credibility with the studentry
Lyons and Klatz moved to temporarily
suspend the SGA bylaw that prevents a
motion from being voted upon unless it has
been placed on the agenda for that week's
meeting. Klatz and Lyons wanted to pro
pose a subsequent motion to poll the
studentry for a vote or confidence on the
Current SGA constitution,

Jim Gillespie's motion that “Joint Board
should restrict itself to making statements
on national political issues to only those
which affect students as students" was the
first item of business. This in itself Con»
stltuted a major parliamentary problem;
in the words of Tad Brenner, Main Hall
Presndent, "I would like to know how you
would go about drawing the line [between
relevant and irrelevant motionsl.“

That was only compounded, though, by
the ensuing debate. Gillespie said, “l'm

not against students being involved in
politics whatsoever," He did qualify that
by saying he felt it wasn't student govern-
ment‘s responsibility or right to facilitate
Student politics Dave Kopelman, who re-
mained silent last week when Gillespie-'5
idea was originally taken up, broughtwhat
Theresa Seebei'ger called “prepared wit"
to lhe meeting this week.

"This gentleman [Gillespiel is ad
vocating apathy," said kopelinan. “The
odd thing is that he is d 'ng it so vehement-
ly, as ii he really cares if you don’t like
it, Mr. Gillespie, perhaps you should go
where people are denser. and thus have
the right to be apathctic." said Kopelrnan,

Students spoke out both for Kopelman
and for Gillespie on the motion, Vice-
Presldent Pete Hautzlnger cited numerous
instances of student government activism
at Grinnell. among them the old Student
Senate‘s support of the [arm workers
strike in 1963, criticism of President
Ford‘s pardon oi President Nixon, and
condemnation of the Ohio National Guard
action at the Kent State shootings in 1973.
Hautzinger also mentioned the more re-
cent issue of Grinnell College divestment
of common stock in corporations doing
business in South Africa.

Cowles President Chuck Blomquist
disagreed with Hautzinger. "Personally I
have talked to a few people in this dorm...
[butl i was not elected on a political plat-
form," said Blomquist.

Bethe Keegan concurred with BlOm'
quist, "I think this is all bogus it you don‘t
ask people." said Keegan. Hautzinger
criticized hall presidents at the beginning
of the meeting for not having been active
enough in soliciting studentopinion in their
dorms,
