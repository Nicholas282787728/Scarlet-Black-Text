Grinnell: Pioneering Small

 

by—loe Neri

It is not hard these days to see the effects
of technology on our everyday lives, In the
age of technology and iniormatin, the con-is
puter has no rival ior being the fastest pron
cessor of information, As society moves in
to the future, the mode or production is
becoming the terminal keyboard. As
business, government, and research in
stitutions employ a greater amount of
computers, students will need to learn
FORTRAN and PASCAL as second
languages, along with French or Spanish

The computer has come a long way at
Grinnell College, This fall was the first
semester that every student was
automatically assigned a computer ac»
count but there have been times when few
students or faculty used the advanced
technology.

The use of some kind of computer at
Grinnell began in the mid~sixtles. In 1968
the college made the commitment to enter
a Regional Computer Center. The center
was composed oi small colleges, like Grin-
nell, that bought computer time from the
University of iowa computer. The Come
puter services were located in the bases
ment of what is now the GTE office
building in downtown Grinnell.

The location was inconvenient, but bet
ween 1968 and 1974, faculty and students
completed projects in statistical data pro
cessing and in FORTRAN programming.
Processing was done in a card batch pro
cess over a link to Iowa City. During this
time, the computer services staff grew
irom a part-time director and two other
assistants to a iull-time director, three
other assistants and a part»time secretary
for the services. Throughout this period,
students worked in positions to augment
the computer services, much like the user
consultants oi today.

in 1975, the college made a major com-
mitment to enhance its computer facilities
and computer use. The college built new
housing in Darby Gymnasium for the sen
vice. The center included housing for the
computer, a small terminal room, and an
office tor the small computer services
staii. The college also bought its iirst in-
teractive timesharing computer, the PDP
is made by the Digital corporation.

At the same time, the commitment also

was made to upgrade the computer
system The college, led by vice President
Waldo Walker, chose to promote academic
computing as more important than ad-
ministrative computing. Most colleges at
this time were usmg the computer basical-
ly ior administrative purposes: accoun-
ting, record keeping, and grade recording.
The commitment to promote academic
computing with academic computing posit
tions was rare [or small colleges.

The facilities installed in '75 were
designed to last ror many years, but de
mand increased rapidly and services were
expanded in 1977. Then, the PDP 45 was
worn out and replaced with a larger com-
puter of the same type, the PDP 11/70. At
first, bath the academic and ad-
ministrative computing were done on the
same computer, but in 1978 the college ad~
tied a second 11/70, The purchase oi the
11/70 was unusual in its capacity for small
college academic purposes,

Since 1975, the college has invested in
upgrading the quality oi hardware and sen
vice to make computing for students and
iaculty easier and more eiticient, Today
the computer services staff consists of 10
fullrtime employees, including three
academic program analysts along with
Prof. Tom Moberg, Director of Academic
Computing.

As the facilities and staff of the come
puting services have grown, so has the use
by both the faculty and students. In the
early years of computing, 19684974, fewer
than 75 students and iaculty a year were
using the computer facilities. By 1931, over
43 percent of the faculty and 41 percent oi
the student body were using the computer,
Use by graduating seniors also increased,
In 1975, only 17,5 percent oi graduating
seniors had used the computer in some
way during their four years in Grinnell. By
1981, over 84 percent oi graduating seniors
had been exposed to the computer.

Today Grinnell is even more computer
oriented. This fall every student has been
provided with a computer account.
Workshops teaching basic skills in the use
oi the computer are open to all students,
As Grinnell participates in the Sloan Foun»
dation, its application oi the computer for
the humanities and social sciences, as well
as the traditional area of the natural
sciences is certain to grow,

Prof, Moberg said that the loo percent
mark of computer literacy by both iaculty
and students is well within reach, given the
high interest shown. Moberg said the come
puting services should be viewed much as
any of the services that have traditionally
been employed in academics. Moberg said
he would like to see “the computer as a
resource, just as familiar to students as
the use of the library."

Introducing 'the
VAX

Kim Lanegran

Over the summer, Grinnell College
received a new computer to be used by the
Grinnell laculty, staii, and students. The
VAx 11/750. made by Digital Equipment
corporation (DEC). was purchased
because the college is reaching the limits
of the capabilities of the PDP 11/705 it now
uses. There are two PDPs here; one is us-
ed for academic work while the other is 115'
ed by the administration, The VAX will
slowly replacc the PDPs because it can do
large statistical packages. work with
FORTRAN which is a language used in
scientiric programs, and carry much
larger programs.

Characters Such as letters, numbers,
commas, etc. are called bytes, when
speaking of computers. Our PDPs can only
handle programs with 64,000 bytes. in
other words, they have 64K memories, The
VAX has a virtually endless memory
because it can store billions of bytes in
each program Since the computer users
at Grinnell would like to be able to work
large programs, this will be a great im-
-rovement,

College Computing

Microcomputers, such as the Apple and
Pet, also will have a major role in the
merger of academics and computers,
along with the main irame systems, The
college has over 45 microcomputers which
are used in the Chemistry, physics,
Biology, Psychology, Math, and Language
departments,

Personal computers also will appear in
the dorm room. Computer Services is try
ing to make available either phone linkage
or direct hookup to the main computer ior
students who have brought their own per-
sonal computers, The use oi personal com-
puters in this way also will helpto alleviate
the growing problem of obtaining a free
terminal. Computer use at the college has
grown so fast that the chance of locating a
tree terminal on any given day is slowly
becoming a major problem Locating a
free terminal during midrsems or finals is
almost impossible.

The personal computer hookups will
move the college a step closer to the
Carnegie-Mellon University computer pro-
gram, which requires all entering students
to purchase a small computer for their
four years at the college. Although this
probably will not be required at Grinnell,
the college is negotiating with the Digital
Corporation to enable staff, faculty and
students to obtain Digital microcomputers
at a 30 percent discount,

An Apple Micro Computer.

The personal computer linkups could on-
ly be the beginning of connecting the entire
campus into one college network and
possibly into many different networks
around the country. In the iuture, Moberg
sees a Grinnell computer network encomr
passing the entire campus. If terminals
are installed in dorm lounges students will
have easy access to a terminal at all times.
But the network will encompass all college
functions and locations including: the
PEG, the library, and the forum. In this
way, a student will be in communcatlon
with the entire campus at all times.

Grinnell is considering hooking up with a
network which will include all ACM cola
leges. Consequently, a student will be able
to contact a friend who attends Coe or even
Carleton

Moberg said he sees endless poss' ties
for the application of networks for the
Grinnell College student and faculty
member, Not only will faculty members be
able to communicate with colleagues
across the country, but students in the
future will be able to talk to their
computer-age parents. The Grinnell coma
munity could be tied into the college com-
puter network and the college network
could be linked to other networks. Certain~
ly these are dreams for the future. But one
ly 15 years ago, man dreamed oi walking
on the moon.

“The Computer Should Be a Resource As
Familiar to Students As the Library"

 

 

 

For usmg the VAX, the college has
ordered four GIGl terminals which are
also made by DEC. In addition to being
able to periorm the function or a regular
terminal, the GlGls can do color graphics,
61615 were chosen by the computer staff
because by staying with DEC. the college
will be able to improve our facilities as
DEC produces better computers, These
GlGls will be tor students to use in the
library most likely, as soon as the VAX has
relieved the PDP or some of its load. The
hope is that they will be in use by second
semester.

Because Grinnell prides itself on its tine
computer Capabilities. and ieels that com-
puters are needed tor a sound education in
this “computer age", the computer
department wants to provide the best
iaciiities tor the students. in order to do

The Vax: The little Dynamo

that, Waldo Walker, Grinnell’s Executive
Vice-President, and Newton Munson,
Director of Computer Services, submitted
a proposal to the Board oi Trustees asking
for 2.1 million dollars to be used for im-
proving the computer system, The money
was alloted just as asked ior. Already,
$100,000 of this over the next four years has
gone for the purchase of the VAX and
$89,000 more was spent on software,

This new computer is in Darby Gymr
nasium with the PDPS and the computer
offices. A switch has been ordered that will
enable users to choose between the VAX
and the PDP computers. The college and
Board of Trustees hope that the students
will make full use of the facilities because
computer knowledge is essential in today’s
world.
