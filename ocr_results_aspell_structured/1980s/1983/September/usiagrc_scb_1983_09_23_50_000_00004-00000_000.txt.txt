 

Scarlet & Black

Opinion

No Questions
No Answers

A common belief on campus holds that the Scarlet and Black is a
newspaper. Few students every go beyond this condition of believing to
one of knowing because few students would question such a belief. That
the Scarlet and Black is a newspaper gains acceptance without ques—
tion for two reasons: the Sier looks like a newspsper and, since
everyone calls it a newspaper, it must be a newspaper. Apart from of»
fering this circumstantial evidence, few students could explain what a
newspsper is, let along opine its function. Since matters requiring
original thought do not fare well on campus, and since some students
require absolute explanations, we will answer our own questions.

Is the Scarlet and Black a newspaper?

The Scarlet and Black is indeed a newspaper. It contains information
and opinion about recent events, feature articles, and advertisements
Thus content, rather than appearance or calling, makes the 5&3 a
newspaper. This granted, we now ask:

What is the function of the Scarlet and Black?

The staff of the Scarlet and Black agrees that faithful presentation of
recent events is an important function of any newspaper. In our news
we strive to include information that might not otherwise receive
dissemination. Fur example, by covering the curriculum debate, we
hope to dispel hearsay and false conclusions that events of such
significance inevitably generate. Apart from presenting information of
general interest, we also exist to entertain. We realize that some
readers take this as our primary function — the personals receive a
greater share of campus interest and response than any other feature.
in the future, however, we would like to see more participation on the
opinion pages by students, faculty, and administrators. To act as a
forum for the exchange of opinion is, in many respects, our reason for
being. It is through the promotion of opinion that we join the tradition
of liberal education.

But does any of this mutter?

Quite simply, it does not matter. Each week the 5&3 staff produces a
newspaper. We do this not because we are journalists — we are not ~
but because we are students interested in promoting ideas. We like
what we do. It pleases us to have a $20,000 budget and few, if any,
restrictions on what we produce. Maybe additional student participa—
tion would improve the 5&8. But then again, how much can one expect
from a college that accepts without questioning.

Thoughts Will Wander

Mary Jane Constant

Has anyone driven along the highways of
the Midwest and not experienced the
phenomena of mind drim Try as one
might to concentrate, thoughts will
wander from the spacious skies and amber
waves of grain. A McDonald’s wrapper on
the side oi the road leads my thoughts back
to the TV commercial of the American in
than with a tear on his cheek. Would the
person who threw the trash out of the car
window have done so if he knew it would
cause tears? Did he think that the garbage
might evaporate? How often do we think of
the consequences of our actions?

Are we or our legislators any better than
that highway slob? Reagan proposes to
deal with the Korean airline incident by
severing social and cultural ties with the
Soviets. Has he considered that this action
may promote the dehumanization and ob»
jectification at the Soviet people? Does he
consider this objectification necessary to
legitimize dabbling in wari

Congress, after much delay and debate.
approved the appropriation of tunds (a
record $187.5 billion) for the MX missile
and tear gas. Congras reacted in an emo-
tional flood after the KAI. airplane inci-
dent, reminding me that there was a time,
not too long ago, when anitsCommunist
legislation was passed in a similar at-
mosphere oi emotional hype and pros
paganda. Where is the intellectual
guidance? What are we so afraid of? How
has the ever-present fear of nuclear an-
nihilation affected our reasoning?

Solutions to the Cold War, the arms race,
and our relations with me Soviets can no
longer be found in technology, or science,

To the Editor:

A story i heard the other day: ”My
woman boss at work, good looking, young,
lived alone, One night a man entered her
apartment and raped her. Another
employee said, “If I’d known it was that
easy, id have tried to rape her a longtime
ago ' " Amusing? How about this: in my
country a twoyear old baby was raped by
her lather. She was in surgery for over six
hours; he went to prison for only eleven
years (with time on tor good behavior I'm
sure). "She was so good looking 1 could
have raped her." Have you ever heard that
statement, or are you guilty at making it
yourself?

That kiiid of statement demonstrates
that there are many facts about rape that
men still do not understand. Numbel‘one is
that rape is an act of violence committed
against any woman 7 age and looks are
not important. “She‘s so ugly no one would
even rape her." Someone rapeda twosyear
old baby; I would hardly call her sexually
attractive Number lwo- rape IS unaccepe
table as a joke or a casual comment. it‘s
simply not funny. It’s probably about as
iunny as being castrated, in treating rnpe
as a joke. we show our acceptance ola pro-
blem that affects all women indirectly and
one at every three women directly With
such a frequent occurrence, the probablli»
(y that you‘re telling a rape joke to so-
meone who has been raped is quite high.

We must try to stop rape, not simply
avmd it. The only way to stop rape is to
make fundamental changes in the at
titudes of society toward women and about
rape. Rape may occur frequently in this
Country, but it should not be treated as a
normal everyday occurrence (as it now is
treated); it should shock and horrily all of
us, every time it happens, whether or not

> we know the victim, I have often heard

or economics: these will no longer suffice.
We must put aside our national pride, and
our fear; our emotions must be in check so
that our intellect and moral reasoning
guide us. it we value life, we must start
realizing mat we are one family of humans
and the earth is our home.

More impel-randy, if we are considering
the consequences of our action, or inac-
tion, then we can no longer let the mass
media reduce us to someﬁling less than
dignified individuals. “Those who have an
interest in keeping the machinery or war
going are a very powerful body; they will
stop at nothing to make public opinion
subservient to their murderous ends."
(Albert Einstien, The World As I See It).
We can no longer let our legislators make
decisions without our input. “The
technical advances of our times have turns
ed this ethical postulate lsecuring peace)
into a matter of life and death for civilized
mankind today, and made the taking of an
active part in the solution of the problem
of peace of a moral duty which no cons-
cientious man can Shirk.” (Einstien)

One such conscientious man was a
farmer from Utah who raised his voice and
offered still another solution to the MX,
which the government plans to base on his
land 200 miles from the nearest town.
(This man moved from Montana to “get
away from it all.") He told some Pentagon
officials, “I’ve heard you talk about the
land mode of attack, and the sea mode,
and the air mode. Well, he got another
ode to add to your list m it’s the commode
so you can just ﬂush all them bombs
away!"

“don't walk alone at night or you can ex
pact to be raped." Perhaps it‘s not wise to
walk alone at night but that is not accep-
table (0 me I will not allow my feminity to
be a handicap.

i would like to ask all the women on cams
pus to try to explain to the male population
why rape is not a joke, and to help
eliminate some of the myths about repel
intend to live my life without being intrud~
ed upon by tear or rape. 7 Karen L. Jensen

To the Reader:
I hope that you liked the SM} last week
— if not the content, then at least the paper
on which it was printed Our publisher fell
behind schedule and was forced to print
the 5&3 on a press that used a higher
quality paper, The cost of the paper,
however, prohibits us lrom using it
regularly So this week we return to the
familiar newsprint paper. Should you wish
to donate $900 a week to the 8&3. we will
gladly use lhe better paper
