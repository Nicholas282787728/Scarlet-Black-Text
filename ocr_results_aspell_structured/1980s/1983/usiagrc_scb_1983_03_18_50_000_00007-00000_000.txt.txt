Grinnell, Iowa 50112

On March 7th and 3th 5000 supporters of
the nuclear freeze descended on
Washington to speak to members oi Con-
gress. Gall Fisher, David Altman, Linda
Rabben, editor of the Grinnell Magazine,
and I attended as members of The Grinnell
Peace Fellowship.

The Citizen’s Lobby for a Nuclear
Freeze was the first organized effort by
freeze supporters to offer legislators the
opinion of the citizenry 10 percent oiwhich
support a freeze as opposed to those of the
president and the defense establishment,
Sepcifically, the objective of the lobby was

to promote passage of legislation in both ,

the House and Senate calling for an im-
mediate mutual verifiable freeze oi the
testing, production, and deployment of
nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union and
United States. The freeze, which is non»
binding, will nevertheless send strong
signals to both the White House and the
Kremlin.

A day-long symposium featuring many
of the national freeze leaders was held on
March 7. Among the many speakers,
Jeremy Stone, director of the Federation
of American Scientists reported that pre-
sent levels of nuclear weapons on both
sides ensure equal decimation in a nuclear
war regardless of the instigator. Marion
Anderson, chairman of Employement
Research Associates, presented data
disclaiming the prevalant notion that Pen-
tagon spending creates jobs. Because it is
more capital intensive than practically
any form of spending, deiense outlays in
1981 resulted in a net loss of more than one
million jobs across the country. In Iowa
more than 39,000 jobs were lost. Paul War-
nke, the head negotiator of SAlT H, ex
plained that our nuclear weapons are the
sme generation as those of the Soviets. In
the Senate confirmation hearings neither
the Joint Chiefs of Staff nor Casper
Weinberger said that they would trade our
nuclear force for the Soviets force. Ronald
Reagan's “window of vulnerability" is a
hoax.

William Colby, former CIA director,
discussed verification, perhaps the most
important and frightening issue of the
freeze. Mr. Colby states ﬂatly that the
freeze is verifiable. With current national
technical means (bureaucratese for spies,
radar and satellites), we can construct a
highly accurate assessment of Soviet

military might. 0n-site inspection , which
would probably be included in the Freeze,
is helpful but not necessary, In iacton-site
inspection is the most easily deceived form
of verification The freeze would give us
the legal right to investigate questionable
Soviet acitlvity. Verifiacation by national
technical means maintanied high Sovxet
compliance in SALT l, and there is no
reason to think it would not do the same in
the freeze,

Now for the scary part. Verification is a
concept for which time is running out, The
wherabouts of the small cruise missile,
United States deployment to begin by the
end of this year, is difficult if not impossir
ble to determine. The United States plans
to install 464 Cruise missles in Europe and
more than 5,000 at home, if this occurs
verification will be obsolete, and so will the
freeze, The cruise mlssle is the most
destabilizing nuclear weapon ever producr
ed, Time to control its Spread is running
out. It was with this sence of urgency tha
150 Iowans bearing 15,000 proxies lobbied
their legislators on March 3.

Many read the Des Moines Register arti»
cle March 9 which described the meeting
with Senatnr Jepson; he gave the delega-
tion only three minutes of his time. Jepsen
did not state a position or listen to the lab
byists, who were restrained and cordial for
as long as possible. Instead he delivered
the same manlcal rhetoric our President
speaks. After Jepson left, his aide con-
tinued t0 spout non-information for half an
hour,

Senator Grassley was willing to meet six
members of the delegation in his office for
thirty minutes. Grassley was ignorant of
the freeze issue, thinking it a called for
unilateral disarmament. (Doesn't he read
the paper?) He was, however, receptive to
the lobbyists and willing to discuss the
issue. He has not been converted, but the
lobby was a success in that Grassley now
understands the benefits of die freeze.

Representative Cooper Evans listened to
about 25 constituents from Hie third
dismct. Though he is a corsponosor of the
freeze, he also supporw the “peace
through strength" bill which advocates an
arms buildup. When asked to clarify his
position on the ireeze, Evans pleaded ig-
norance. The Citizen’s Lobby was educa-
tional for Evans, though his commitment
to the freeze he co-sponsors is suspect.
