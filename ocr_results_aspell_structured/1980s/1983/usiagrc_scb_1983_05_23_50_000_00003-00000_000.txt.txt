When the editor of this i ue asked me to
contribute something to it, he must have
had In mind that nobody could have gone
through as many Commencemelits as I
and lived to tell it True, Ihave been an in»
itiate at. several such rites: true, I have
also sat in the parent's sweaty seat, My
cap and gown have acquired a certain
patina. so maybe the best use i can make
of this space is to draw on that long ex
perience, and help everybody have as
glorious a time at it as possible during
these next few days, given the cir-
cumstances. For there are certain exigen-
cies to be aware of. and certain hazards to
be avoided. Here are some such.

1. Fatigue » Parents have driven for four-
teen hours, students have had three all-
nighters during Ule past week. Proiessors'
home phones have been ringing on the
hook, and in their offices they have been
trying to read papers while being beset by
sentimental Students. late Students. and
students afraid to emerge from the womb.

about the college administration s
