on the walls?

Bennett Lats/ea

in the spring or 1980, my freshman year,
the administrators of our shrine of the 0b-
solete publications, Burling Library, took
it to mind to rid said structure's bathroom
walls of all those scurrilous scrawlings we
know as graititi, Some untortunate Biro
employee was set to the task oi scouring
the scribblmgs, only to tind the walls sadly
soiled again the following day.

The letter reprinted below resulted from
the series oi events it describes. Apparent-
ly, someone has again decreed that the
Burling bathroom walls will somehow
serve us best in unblemished eggshell
white, and again some poor 8&6 worker
has been fated to the requisite daily scrub
bing chores. Thus, l thought it appropriate
to resubmit this letter to the campus come
munity (minus some or the grammatical
flaws of the original).

One last comment: It should be wor-
thwhile to note that Mr, Pandolfo (then a
bigwig in the library slam eventually
dropped his charge against me and agreed
that the graffiti really wasn’t all that bad.
should i be so presumptuous as to think it
might work again?

To the JudlClal Council and all else con-
cerned:

On March 11, i was in the process of
drawing a Snoopy on the wall or the men's
room in Hurling Library with a blue Magic
Marker felt-lip pen, when steve Pandolfo
entered the washroom. He has now, as I
understand, brought vandalism charges
against me relating to a large number of
markings made on those walls over a
period of several weeks in blue ielt-tip pen.
I don't think it would be unreasonable to
suppose that some other student might
also own a blue Magic Marker and may
have been responsible for these other
markings. but nevertheless there is no
question that I did mark on the wall

But this is a trivial point — the question
is one of principles , . . . When I visited as a
prospective student last year, my tour
guide made a point of showing me the
Burling bathroom walls, proudly explain-
ing the timerhonured tradition of their
grairiti, i was impressed — both by the

quality oi the graliiti (which was substan-
tially more mature, meaningiul and/or
humorous than that which I was accustoms
ed to seeing in high schooll and by the
reflection of student freedom it
represented, And on page 72 of the Go
Handbook i was given by the admissions
people, it said that the Burling bathroom
walls were the place to go to “find out cur-
rent campus scuttlebutt." The graffiti was
presented as an attribute or the college,
and I saw it as such lincidentally, so did
my parents). Why the sudden change?

Until several years ago, there was a
iaculty-judged contest between Burling's
men's and women's washrooms called the
“Toilet Bowl," in which the best graffiti
was chosen, I do not think there are
grounds to deny that drawing and writing
on the bathroom walls at Burling Library
has been at least tactily, if not explicitly,
sanctioned by the college as a privilege or
the students. Even though my activities do
fit Webster's definition of vandalism, I do
not think ican be justly punished for exer-
cising this privilege,

it, however, the administrators no
longer wish to recognize this priVilege,
which I think would be unfortunate, the
policy change must be publicly and ex-
plicitly announced before it can be con-
sidered legitimate, as it is the responsibili-
ty of the lawgiver to promulgate the law.
And if the crusade for clean walls is owing
entirely to Mr. Pandolfo, then he should
work through the established channels to
implement such a policy change.

And in making and enforcing their grai-
iiti policy, the college is obliged to consider
both the attributes of graffiti and the
general opinion oi the college community
as well as the complaints against graiiiti.
The value of graffiti as a means of expres-
sion and communication 7 and as a liberty
of the participants 7 has been established
|n more than one sociological study. when
the People‘s Republic of China established
free walls for its people to write on, the ac-
tion was praised and respected around the
world.

Nor is the consensus on campus against
graiiiti The feeling of the student body is
fairly evident in the petition of over 300

signatures i have presented to the Judicial
Council. The petition also includes the
signatures oi several prospectives and
even the parents at one prospective stu~
dent. iAnd they're the ones wrth the
bucks l interestingly, even parents who.
did not sign were pleased with the idea of
"free walls" and seemed sympathetic, it
not disappointed, that the privilege was be-
ing rescinded. One student told me that
during a recent alumni meeting on cam~
pus, he was in the Burling men's room
when one of the visiting alumni walked in
and asked, surprised and disappointed,
what had happened to the graffiti. when
the student told him that it was being
scrubbed off daily, he reacted with
dismay, saying that he had gone to the
washroom just to see the graffiti. Do we
keep no loyalty to our alumni?

As was pointed out to me by my adviser,
Mr. Worley, it is important that i
distinguish between Creative graffiti and
destruction or offensive graiiiti. There is,
as I'm sure we've all observed, graffiti
which is nothing more than hostile and
destructive, as well as graffiti that is
disgracefully inlantile and graffiti that has
nothing in say but something nasty about
someone who usually doesn‘t deserve it.
This can't be condoned by anyone. But
there is also a lot of graffiti mat is
harmless, humorous and insightful, and
this is a respectable means of communicar
tiOn.

The Burling walls once boasted a very
high proportion at such “good" graffiti.
There isn't, and probably will never be, a
public washroom in the world that is
without graititi, and in trying to make ours
so, the good graffiti has all been lost. All
that remains is destruction and hostility
(mostly in reaction to the new poliCles).

i don’t think i have offended anyone by
writing on the walls 7 i certainly didn't ms
tend to do so. iwas participating in what 1
considered a worthwhile and amusing way
or passing some time. So rd like to ask,
Steve, that you leave us our free walls and
that you let that poor 8&6 man do
something more constructive with his
time. And, eventually, the graffiti might
be good again.

Stress series
questioned

To the Editor:

After reading the iront page article on
tension of last week's Scarlet. and Black, I
felt overjoyed that someone had finally
revealed the untold story of the massive
pressures that come to bear on a student at
Grinnell. These pressures are real and un-
til now haven‘t been appreciated.

As a result or the diversity of the people
here, Grinnell's campus is a virtual haven
for tension. Just the thought of not getting
enough signatures on a nuclear freeze peti-
Lion would send anyone swooning to near
breakdown proportions. Add this to the
the fact that the all-male dorm is throwing
another party with the sole intention to
degrade all of womanhood (those sexist
idiots) and this campus has got a real pro»
blem,

Furthermore, trying to arrange your
Schedule with all the activity that sur-
rounds this campus can be a major source
of tension. I know of three or four days this
year alone when I couldn’t find time for an
Anti-Nuclear Anything Rally or fit a
speech by my favorite liberal into my

schedule. (I can’t go a day without hearing
that famous Robin Hood ideology of steal-
ing from the rich and giving to the poor.)

And now to further complicate our lives
the administration has reinstated the F
grade. Can’t the administration unders-
tand that we have enough pressures on us
that we shouldn't have the fear of earning
an ”F" in a course to make us more tense?
How can we be expected to learn with the
threat of an F around our necks? Well, I
certainly can't handle that pressure, so
I'm looking for a school where the
pressure or an r is not there. i haven’t
found one above kindergarten yet, but rm
still trying. — Sincerely, will Rutgers '35

Response to editorial

To the Editor:

The editorial of Feb, 25 suggested three
ways by which the “continuity, breadth
and depth which a core curriculum pro-
vides" could otherwise be achieved. They
were: a revision of U18 tutorial system, a
more careful advising system, and more
rigidly enforced prerequisites. These seem
to place the burden on the faculty and ad-
ministration when it should be on the
students. Tutorials, advisors and the lack
of prerequisites aren't keeping us from
broadening and‘de'epening our curriculum; '

so why should we demand that anyone
iorce us to do it? The courses are there for
the taking; it we choose diverse and
logically sequenced courses, “Perhaps
then the quality of a Grinnell education
would be commensurate with the price."
Sincerely, Stephen Wright

Swimmers

sound-off

To the Sports Editor:

Saturday, Feb. 19, 1983, the women's
swim team captured the Midwest Con-
ierence Championship. This was the
team's fifth consecutive conference title.
Winning by nearly zoo points, the team
took first place in seven of 15 events. In the
process, three school and three conierence
records were broken.

We realize there is a limited amount of
space, and we did appreciate the picture.
However, as this was me climax of the
season, the team felt it was entitled to
some recognition. We hope we are not
overlooked again in the iuture. — Penny
Bates, Janice Mineah, and the other non-
felon‘ious members of the women’s swim

I didn't go to the Scholar's Convocatin
again yesterday i really ieel guilty about
it. i mean the college really makes an era
iort to bring in a wide variety or speakers
discussing a lot of different subjects And I
just figure the lunch line will be shorter,

And the Scholar's Convocation isn't all
there is. A person could get a pretty darn
good education just from the visiting lec—
turers alone, And i go down to Pamida to
play Ms, PaoMan,

oh, I’ve gone to a few convocations and
lectures, One was on jazz, and the other
time I went because some woman asked
me if I wanted to go with her.

Every time I see a lecture scheduled
that sounds iairly interesting, i go through
die same old routine, ”I really should go.
But i don’t know, rm just tired of listening
to lectures ”

I think that's the problem. ispend about
twelve hours a week listening to lectures.
Twelve hours of intellectualism. Twelve
hours of intense thinking on intense sub
jects, And then they want me to do a couple
more hours of that for no credit. It's just
hard for me to get into it. I mean, why
don't they have Bill Cosby do a Scholar’s
Convocation?

It's kind of like the commencement
speech. We’re getting John Kenneth
Galbraith this year. Don’t get me wrong, i
think that's great. But man, i've just
finished with four years of lectures, I‘m
going on to two more years or lectures, and
I’d kind of like someone to get up there an
sa - “Hey, I’d like to do a few jokes {or you
now, And after that I’ll do a little
juggling." ,

I guarantee that Mr. Galbraith will open
with a joke, but it's just not the same.

i could tell i wasn’t just another guy, i
was someone special. i could tell the
minute I picked her up to go to the mOVies.
she was wearing her dress pair ot sweat-
pants.

Sweatpanm. what a concept. People
wear them to class, to meals, everywhere.
A professor in a suit or dress lectures to a
class of sweatpants. is the lecture that in-
vigorating? I wonder if even half uie peo-
ple who wear sweatpants around campus
have ever sweated in them.

That's what they’re made for, you know.
Sweating. Where did anyone get the idea
that sweatpants are suitable attire for
around the town".

You know it’s getting bad when you’re
complaining about people wearing sweat-
pants. A sure sign of student burnout.

Colleges all over are in financial straits.
They're all scrambling for money and for
ways to get more money. Ours has come
up with an interesting “solution." Ask peo~
pie for it.

Sure. every college asks for donations,
but it has always been discreet and, well,
sort of dignified. But now Grinnell has U15
telethon. That's certainly not discreet.

i never worked on a telethon, so i never
really know who was called. But now I do.
Man, they call anyone connected with the
college. Past, present and future. Anyone.
The connection doesn’t even have to be
more than remote.

They call parents, alumni, even former
students who didn't graduate from here.
Pretty soon those sources are going to dry
up, and then who will they call? Former
