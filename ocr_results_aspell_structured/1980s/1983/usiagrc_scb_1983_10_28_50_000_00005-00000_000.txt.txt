Grinnell Magazine April-May, 1983.

Having now written numerous columns
and articles on the curriculum debate, this
cub reporter believes that the time has
come to express his own views on the
issue. It is thus with fear and trepidation
that l expose my paper chin to the counter
punch.

stated quite simply, I don't like the pro-
posed requirements. My reasons are
many, but allow me to argue that at least
some of them are rational.

One argument given by the proponents
of requirements is that Grinnell needs to
keep pace with the times. Professor of
History Philip L. Kintner aptly refutes this
argument in the January lSBZ issue of
Grinnell Magazine, “Core courses are the
wave of the future, some say. and Grinnell
is being left behind 7 but that is a classic
non-reason for change. If we tell our
children not to do something just because

_everybody else is doing it, no more should
we-as teachers. The arguments for re
quired courm have not yet proved convin-
cing.”

One is even less convinced when one can
siders the statements oi two proponents oi
a change to requirements, in the same
issue of Grinnell Magazine, Dean of the
Faculty Catherine Frazer writes, “It
would be the ultimate irony if a liberal~arts
college allowed contentment with the
status quo to turn the old radicalism into
the new conservatism, by considering the
present curriculum beyond the need for
modification.” Meanwhile, Professor of
Biology Kenneth Christiansen noted in a
recent interview that Grinnell is one of the
last colleges oi its kind with “the vestiges

On Sunday, Oct. 16, 15 Grinnell students
went to the Strategic Air Command
(S.A.C.) Headquarters in Omaha,
Nebraska to protest. Since then, many peo-
ple, protesters and non-protesters alike,
have wondered just how effective the
S.A.C. protest was 7 just what it ac
complished. Each of the protesters had his
own, personal reason ior protesting;
therefore, the relative success of each per-
son’s action must be compared with his
particular goals. The one purpose which
the group was unanimously in agreement
about was their concern with bringing the
nuclear issue to the “fore of public
debate." The memod which may used to
accomplish this was to receive as much
media coverage as possible. A report of
the protest appeared in The Omaha World
Herald, The Des Moines Register, and at
least one of the Omaha television stations.
Also, as these protests become more and

'more frequent, it becomes increasingly
easier for people to participate in such pro
tests. Because of the persistence of the
protesters over the years, the number of
protesters has grown exponentially. In the

of the superrllberal '60'5 era still intact,"
The juxtaposing oi these two statements
leads one to question which represents the

new conservatism, the open curriculum or -

the proposed requirements. it would seem
that during a period when the dominant
forces in society are moving toward the
right, “keeping pace with the times” most
likely represents a move toward “the new
conservatism.” Perhaps we live in a time
when we should be proud to be 20 years
behind the times. '

Before the reader accuses this cub
reporter of nostalgia for the '60‘s, allow
him to make a few poinE about that
period. The 1960’s were a time of the ex-
pansion of liberties, for instance the civil
rights movement. They were also a time in
which students had a great deal of political
power. It is no coincidence then, that the
open curriculum was a product of that
period. But in the 1930's, student power is
at a low ebb, and we are told that liberty is
not an issue in this debate.

Another area of concern has been the ad-
vising system. Adovcates of requirements
argue that students reiuse to take what
professors say they should, but at uie same
time argue that some professors do not
know enough about certain areas of the
curriculum to properly advise students.

It is disturbing that much of this argu-
ment is phrased in business terminology,
There is concern about the “quality of
Grinnell’s product" and “false advertis»
ing” to perspectives, The students are
alternately viewed as “consumers” and
r w materials. It all makes one long for
the mic when Grinnell was viewed as an
experience rauier man a manuiacturing
process,

Requirements offer a mechanical solu-
tion to the problems of advising, which im~
poses one particular notion of a liberal
education on everyone, I for one find the
particular notion being proposed objec-
tionable. I disagree with the content as
well as the form of the proposal.

One area which has been particularly
emphasized in the debate is science. Pro—
ponents of a science requirement argue
that in this age of science and technology,
it is essential that liberally educated per-
sons be exposed to science. I do not wish to

early 1950’s one person protested at the
S.A.C. base every couple of years, it has
now grown to the point that a group of
about 15 people protested the week before

. the Grinnell students, and a much larger

group was planning to protest at S.A,C. on
the following weekend. Each time such a
protest is held, it receives some media
coverage. Therefore, me Grinnell pro—
testers not only iniormed the public with
the news coverage of their own protest, but
they also helped ensure that the public will
be informed on an increasingly frequent
basis. It is difficult to measure the success
of the protest in definite terms, but it is

proposed requiremen (lrllé‘ students
would leave Grinnell \ thou: such skills.

1 do not offer an alternative set of re-
quirements, but instead belleve that most
of the disctpllnes which Grinnell offers are
equally important, Any set oi re
quirements arbitrarily emphasizes some
areas at the exclusion of others, The Slmr
ple fact is that, as Professor Kintner has
argued, a liberal education is a lifelong
endeavor, which cannot be completed in
four years.

In the time needed to fulfill the eight
credit science requirement plus the re-
quired lab periods, a student could take
three of the introductory courses ior non-
majors, Courses which Professor of
Physics Beryl Clotfelter argued in his 1982
convocation lecture, better suit the pur-
poses of general education than the eight
credit sequence lab courses.

Furthermore it makes little sense to re-
quire an eight credit sequence of social
science when logical sequences do not ex-
ist in most departments. Time is a rare
commodity at Grinnell, extra time spent in
one area must be subtracted from other
possibilities

In an article on the revitalization of
liberal education, John B, Stephenson and
Robert F. Sexton discuss the views of
Sidney Hook concerning choice and human
freedom. These views provide an in-
teresting commentary on the curriculum
issue, “Sidney Hook. . , maintains that
making a choice among alternatives, all oi
which may be somewhat unattractive, is
the constant dilemma oi man." They go on
to quote nook directly, “indeed, the
operating effectiveness of human choice is
what we mean by freedom."

These statements provide a point oi
departure from which i would like to offer
some ideas for possible alternative Solur
tions to the problems which requirements
address. if students are ever to become
free human beings they must learn to
make effective choices. perhaps choosmg
between courses is a place to begin.

But if students are to make effective
choices, they need adequate iniormation.
Thus students should learn about What a
liberal education is, and be exposed to the
varying opinions about its essence and
content. This could be done during new
students days and in the tutorial, although
some discussion of the issue should take
place at the perspective stage to avoid

examples are Gandhi, who refused to co
operate with the British government, and
Thoreau, who refused to pay tam which
would have been used to support the
Mexican~American war, Several people
have also denied their governments their
services by exiling themselves instead oi
allowing their governments to enlist them
into the Armed Forcu. Those protesters
who agree with Debs, Gandhi, Thoreau,
and many others wok one step in a povenr
tial career of civil disobedience.

Although the protesters did not have
uniform reasons for protesting, they were
all extremely aware of the horror which

undeniable that the protest must be viewed
as somewhat successful in this respect.
Eugene V. Debs said, “[War is an] ad-
junct to wholesale and persistant robbery
commited under the organization falsely
called civilization.” Some of the S.A.C.
protesters also believe war to be inherent-
ly wrong. These people believe it to be
their duty to do whatever is within their
power to stop wars and to avoid
cooperating with a government which is
participating in such barbaric activities.
This type of civil disobedience has been USV
ed several times throughout history with
various results. Two’of the better known

wars expose people to, and they were
determined to do something to avoid any
unnecessary bloodshed. They differed in
their opinions of what constituted amiable

missiles or deploy missiles in specific
places. They were unified, however, in
their refusal to be idle spectators while the

”false advertising.” Students could write
essays on their own definition of llberal
education which could later be r ferred to
each semester in choosing cours

Another possibility ior improving the err
lectiveness of Choice would be to form slllr
dent academic advlsmg groups to supple
incnt the advising systcni. These groups
could consist ol students from different
divisions and class years Members or the
groups could advise one another on ap-
propl‘late courses and question whether
members were-achieving a liberal educar
tlon, Often lt is the students who have the
best information on the value of different
courses,

George Drake's first convocation leer
ture, delivered in me, was entitled
.“Liberal Arts and the Human Imagina-
tion." I recall Drake speaking about the
imaginative element of juxtaposing seem-
ingly unrelated ideas to arriv at new con
cepts. This notion describes ldw I have ap
preached the curriculum at Grinnell. As I
come upon ideas from one discipline, while
studying anodier l discover uie impor-
tance oi a discipline in which 1 previously
had lime interest. I am still discovering
new areas of importance as I prepare to
leave Grinnell.

I believe that Grinnell’s open curriculum
attracts students with imagination and
creativity. It is these qualities that have
made Grinnell a special and interesting
place to be. The increased pressures which
students face in these difficult times is
stifling that imagination and creativity,
and I believe that requiremens might eXr
tinguish that special quality of Grinnell
completely. Today's world needs imagina-
tion and creativity.

It is for these reasons that Iurge that the
faculty retain the open curriculum and
seek creative and imaginative solutions to
the problems they perceive in the present
system. it is only through such means that
we can become the curricular pioneers
whose absence Professor Wall laments.

Furthermore, unless we become
pioneers mrough more imaginative solur
tions to our problems, Grinnell will always
be the ”Harvard of the Mid~West" and we
will never succeed in making Harvard the
“Grinnell of the East,”

iate of the entire human race is being
decided. Literally millions oi Europeans
have been protesting various nuclear
issues during the past lew weeks where as
only a handl'u'i of Americans have made
any effort to take an active role in attemp-
ting to enforce what they belive to be right.
Obviously, nobody likes war, but
Americans seem alarmingly apathetic
about the subject. There has been much
debate about whether governments are
best iought from within their particular
system or by using extra-legal meansi
There is little disagreement, however, that
to change a government or a governmen-
tal policy, people must be willing to make
an effort and to take a risk, Americans
have the power and intelligence to create a
government or governmental policy which
protects their interests and provides them
with very good living conditions. but they
must realize the importance of becoming
involved and working to change what they
disagree with. in this light, the site. pro-
testers were successiul. Those who pro-
tested had ideals which they believed in
and they assumed the responsibility to do
what they could to realize )heir ideals.
