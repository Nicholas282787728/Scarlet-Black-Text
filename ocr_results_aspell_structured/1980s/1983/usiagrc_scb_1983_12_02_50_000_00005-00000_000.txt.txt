SGA, national issues, and representation:

An inquiry

by Raffael Stein

In the ongoing debate of whether or not
the Student Government Association
should Concern itself with national issues
the greater and more fundamental ques
tion — that of adequate representation —
has emerged. In this Column, I shall air
tempt to list and clarify some of the
arguments, positions, and actions in this
matter. Furthermore, I shall expose some
of the possible solutions recently voiced
with regard to the concern of inadequate
representation.

On November 16, one week aiter publicly
voicing a concern about Joint Board's in»
volvement in the domain of national
issues, Jim Gillespie offered a motion that
called for Jomt Board to restrict itself
to making statements on national political
issues to only those which affect students
as Students " It also called on Joint Board
to . . poll student's opinion on their
statements and release the statement on
behalf of those who support it " in the
lengthy discussion that followed, many
viewpoints were expressed by .i.B, reps

Before 1 go on, 1 think it is important to
note that Mr, Gillespie's resolution did not
call for the disbandment of the new Com-
mittee on Student Politics,

Among the many different arguments
used in support of the resolution were the
feeling that Grinnell students held so many
diversified opinions that it would be imr
possible to accurately represent a majori»
ty View and the belief that SGA has no ex»
pertise in the area. It was also argued that
by putting SGA‘s stamp on an opinion it

will be interpreted as signiiiying that the
whole student body supports it The tact
that private and student organizations
already exist whcrcby students can arr
tlculate their political beliefs was also
mentioned, One of the most often stressed
points was that J B reps were not elected
to represent students in such matters.

In turning to the other side oi the argu-
ment, which was able to garnera vast ma~
joi‘ity of J B. reps in defeat of the resolu
tion, there seemed to emerge an unabash»
ed feeling that the handling of issues that
do not necessarily affect students as
students ls well within their Jurisdiction A
strong sentiment was held among certain
students that a type or censorship oi the
government was taking place Junior ace
tivist Dave Kopelman went Lo the pomt of
publicly lambastlng Mr. Gillespie's mo»
tion In this and other statements, one can
see that students on the opposing side or
the issue are iirmly committed to their
beliefs and are offended by each others'
actions

opponents of the Gillespie resolution
repeatedly voiced the opinion that it was
ludicrous to suggest that one could
separate politics irom government. but
then failed to qualify their assertion. SGA
vice~president Pete Hautzinger dealt a
blow to the question of jurisdiction by
citing numerous examples of past resolu-
tions involving incidents seemingly not
directly related to students It is fortunate
that this revelation came at a point well in-
to the debate, thus allowing for J.B reps to
independently ponder the question without

being inlluenced by past policies,

From both sides we see the emergence
of the question of representation For the
prOrGillespie motion people. the issue oi
representation is one oi iundainental im-
portance and can even be viewed as the
hcart oi their opposition. For the antir
Gillespie motion people, representation is
believed to be the foundation lol‘ their
Jurisdictional rights in all matters, in-
cluding the disputed domain, But. as one
can witness in J.B meetings, there are
some problems with the current system oi
represenbation.

Let us examine the recent history and
current problems of representation In
SGA, A year ago, bylaws were added to the
SGA constitution that made it mandatory
that all resolutions up for a vote in Joint
Board be posted in advance. and required
all J B. reps to write and post minutes of
the meetings and indicate how they had
Voted The essence of this 'reiorm period‘
was to close an apparent or seemingly ap-
parent gap between the student body and
its numerous representatives in J B. Now
one year later, the SGA vice-president.
while surveying the individual dor-
matol‘ies' bulletin boards, found many
J.B. reps to be negligent oi their duties
Earlier this semester, a proposal was
postponed (by a unanimous votet in order
to give the members of Joint Board a
chance to reier the matter to their respec»
tive constituencies. At the following
meeting, someone had the curiousity to
ask how many of them actually talked to

members of their dorms No more than a
handiul out oi some twentyrfive rose their
hands (Not included in this group was the
member who had the democratic idea of
deterring the motioni One must note,
however, that these examples do not
necessarily signily a Iailure of our system
oi government, which would in turn re.
quire a major structural reform This is
the case simply because, as in the real
world, students must and do place a cerr
tain amount of faith in their candidates
judgement

However, a problem 7 whatever its
magnitude — exists, and numerous solu-
tions to it have been proposed Among
them we find a proposal tor a greater
degree of eniorcement oi the rules,
brought forth by SGA Finance Chairman
Robert Sckalor, that would make hall
presidents carry petitions to their dorms,
obtain signatures, and then vote according
to the signatures on the petition, Other pro-
posals call for more student input in the
lorm oi various types of petitions and open
forums. Some action on this matter can be
expected to take place.

Where does this leave SGA? [t is hard to
tell. Proposed changes, reiorms. and
restrictions ot functions can and are being
iorcibly argued irom many diiierent
angles. In my opinion, these events are
compelling concerned students and
members of SGA to rte-evaluate the
organization's duties, responsibilities, and
goals These moments of reassessment
can only better the institution

The Japanese medical system: A serious flaw

by Andrew Reeves

The Japanese have an excellent health
care system which covers virtually
everyone There is also a long tradition of
sending physicians abroad to study; until
recently, Japanese doctors were required
to learn German so that they could either
study in Germany or read the various Ger
man texts imported to Japan More recent-
ly, there has been a noticeably growing
tradition of studying in the United States.
In short, the medical profession in Japan
has taken giant strides in a very short
amount oi time, The progress has not
come, however, without its drawbacks

Every person in Japan is covered by one
oi the variety of health insurance policies
administered by the Ministry of Health
and Welfare (MHW) The MHW is in some
ways similar to our Department of Health
and Human Services; it regulates the en-
tire health care industry, as well as dispen-
sing health care iunds, Combined, the
various policies oi the MHW cover virtual-
ly 100 percent oi the Japanese populace.
Depending on the exact policy that a per-
son is covered under, the MHW will pay
between 50 and 80 percent oi the medical
bill.

The point oi the MHW is to give everyone
the care that they need, Without paying Itir
any kind of elective service Thus, there
are a number oi types or treatment not
covered by the MHW policies These con-
sist mostly or treatments that are
cosmetic, or in any way elective Most
notable of these is obstetrics. If there Is an
unusual or life threatening condition in the
pregnancy, the insurance is applicable,
Otherwise, delivery is considered to be an
elective procedure, in that one "elects" to
have a child, Other treatments not covered
include such things as placing a bridge
alter a patient's tooth has been removed.
The removal is covered because it is a
curative treatment, but the replacement is
consided a cosmetic treatment not Vital to

the health of the patient, and thus not
covered.

Physicians who wish to treat patients
under any oi the government health
policies must obtain a certificate from the
MHw, The MHW, administering the
policies for too percent of the populace, IS
thus eiiectively the regulating body ior all
Japanese physicians. Any physician who
does not cooperate with the MHW regula~
tions, or violates any health care laws,
may have his or her certificate revoked trip
that event, the patients oi such a physician
would be required to pay 100 percent at the
cost of all curative treatments rather than
the usual 2060 percent that would be the
patient's responsibility under the Ml-Iw
policies. No physician is econmically able
to practice without an MHw certificate

In Japan, approximately titty percent oi

It is possible, then. that a patient couldiind
out everything done in the treatment of
his/her disease. and determine the total
price of the care, The control of the MHW
extends beyond the office, however; the
prices or all prescription drugs are also
fixed, This is the most important single
tact when trying to gain an understanding
oi what I consider the most serious pro
blem in the current Japanese health care
field: overrprescriptlon.

in such one man hospitals, drugs are
customarily sold directly irom the physir
Cian to the patient, although there are in
dependent pharmames. The price does not
vary irom doctor to doctor, because it is
tixed by the MHW. however. the price at
which the physician buys the drug is not
iixed, it, tor some reason, the wholesale
price oi a drug were to go above the fixed

Physicians in Japan do not always realize a
400 percent proﬁt on drugs, but such proﬁts

are not unusual.

the physicians run what I call "one man
hospitals,” That is, they have an oliice.
perhaps a few beds, and all the equipment
necessary for their day to day practice
Most have a nurse or two, or someone who
does the bookkeeping. ln this kind oi
“hospital," a doctor would send cases that
he/she cannot handle directly to a large
hospital.

Another iacct ol health care under lhe
MHW is that the fees tor all medical
treatments, tests, and procedures are iix-
ed, There is, literally a large catalogue
that is used to determine the overall price
oia palient's treatment in it are listed all
the various treatments available in Japan
The practice locale, training and ex
perience oi the physician are not con
sidered when the fee protile is iormulatcd

luliw price. the doctor would lose money
cvcrytime the drug was necessarey.
Wholesale prices do, oi course, iluctuate,
and to make sure that doctors do not losc
money when they prescribe. the MHW
keeps their prices ior drugs well above the
market prices ln short, a Japanese physio
man can make money simply by prcscrib
ing drugs. As a consequence, some
Japanese physicians have been accused oi
purposely ovcr»prescribing mudi tions.

I spoke with Mr llitoshi Taniguchi, ol
Pfizer Limited, about the amount that
drugs are marked up by the Ml-iw He
stated that ii a pharmeceuticul manufac»
tiircr sells 2| drug ior so you per unit (
about 20 cents), the physician may be pay-
ing about 100 yen per unit by the time it
gets through the wholesaler, But the retail

price, iixed by the MHW, may very well be
as much as 500 yen per unit or course. not
all drugs have such large profit margins.
Drugs which are made by a large number
oi firms and are widely prescribed. such
as penicillin, tend to be sold with a smaller
MHW markup Physicians do not always
realize a doc percent profit on drugs. but
such proiit margins are not unusual,

While for the American it may seem a
conilict oi interest for the physician to sell
drugs, dispensing prescription medica
tions ls considered a legitimate source of
income ior physicians in Japan, The exact
percentage or a physican's income which
is derived from the sale of medications
depends on the specialty oi the physician,
his practice patterns, and on the person
himself. it has been generated by dispensV
ing medication because the high proiit
margins apply to many phsyicians, it is not
surprising to tind that some physicians
prescribe more medicine than is actually
necessary ior a particular problem As a
whole, how much do they prescribe" In
1981, the most recent year ior which i
could obtain data, 38.7 percent of all
medical expenditures in Japan was Ior
prescription medicine,

Many social critics in Japan have sug
gested that the problem oi over
prescription might be best dealt with by
removing any iinnncial incentive to
prescribe. The Japanese medical come
munily is, or course, reluctant to give up
their right to dispense medications in
order to counter the resulting loss at in-
come. were thls suggestion followed. the
MHW would almost certainly have to
make up the diiierence by raising the iixed
prices oi some other area oi health care
While this might alleviate the problem of
over-prescription, it might merely
transier the problem to another area oi
health care.
