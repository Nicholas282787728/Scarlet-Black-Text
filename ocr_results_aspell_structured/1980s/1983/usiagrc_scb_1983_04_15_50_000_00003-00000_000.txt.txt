by Nancy Roderlnecher

"Happy. witty and unpredictable, wry
and sunny music that makes the feet bob,"
this is the stuff of which ragtime music is
made, and the New England Ragtime
Ensemble just might play it better than
any other group in the world.

The graminyeaward winning ensemble
has received universal acclaim — making
crowds clap, stomp and whistle lrom
Carnegie Hall to the White House. Thetl‘
repertoire features the tunes composed by
the iinest oi all rag masters including Scott
Joplin, James Scott and Joseph Lamb.

With a relaxedsouding and easygoing
style, ragtime is ironically one or the most
difficult forms of music to perform. In the
\vords of a Pliiladelpia Inquirer music
critic, it is “a disarmingly simple music
that refuses to give away all its secrets
even with frequent replaying,"

Under the direction of one of the music
World‘s most pre-eminent personalities.

was iirst iormed in i972 by a group of
students at the New England Conservatory

crowd-pleasing music six months each

Twenty years after The Bicycle Thiei.
DeSica's neoerealist film of the 405,
Michelangelo Antonioni said ii‘ he had
made Bicycle Thief, he would have asked
“more about the man and less about the
bicycle." DiSica and his colleagues workr
ed through statements and protests of
social injustice, while Antonioni and his
colleagues pose questions and present
“slices of experience," leaving the viewer
to make up his own mind about what the
trim is abo t.

Antonio s statement expresses not one
ly the transition from Bicycle Thief to
mow-Up. but the modern cinema's reac-
tion against a cinema of straightiorwai-d
social purpose. Antonloni's is a cinema oi
personal relationships and antiheroes. ani
amoral cinema, where through a series of
happenings and generalizations, the
viewer comes to make his oivn judgment.
The work oi Antonioni presents recurring
themes. the iinpermanence oi love, the
difficulty of communication. the ease of
betrayal andlhe denial of conscience. All
are aspects of modern society which he
seems to note again and again while in-
sisting that moral advances must accom-
pany technological changes.

Blow-Up is the story or a British iashion
photographer (David Hemmlngsl who.
while taking pictures in a park,
photographs a murder or does he? The
more he blows the photos up, the more the
incident is obscured The film features
amazing cinematography, iascinating use
of color andran excellent musical score by
Herbie Hancock. There is also a cameo ap.
pearance by the Yardbirds with Jeri Beck
and Jimmy Page.

This is one of the landmark films of the
sixties. Its presentation oi issues at
"truth" has rarely been equaled in film
history: the entire reality and morality of
the film has inthe viewer‘s eye. Anyone
who enjoys iine cinema should not miss it.

Jewish Cultural Film. Gentleman's Agree-
iiiciit

To some, the movie Gentleman's Agree-
ment may seem dated. Gregory Peck stars
as a gentile man who masquerades as a
Jewish man in order to explore, antlr
Seinitisln, As he goes further and further
along in his Charade he begins to realize
more and more the insults and degrada»
tion a man has to go through Just because
those around hiln consider him to be
Jewish.

it is a poweriul and insightiul movie
about racism and hate on the same level as
books such as, Black Like Me. and Soul
Sister. .

But it is also important, especially for
this campus, because it presents a world
problem that is all too easy to iorget —
even at Grinnell Anti-Semitism has been
the most vicious, most destructive, most
prevalent iorin oi racism throughout
history. When you live on a campus that
has a large percentage of Jews you tend to
iorget that the Jewish population is one oi
the smallest and at the same time one of
the must abused racial populations in the
world. _

Ramsm is bad, in whatever form it
comes. it's hurtful and painful and as
great an injustice as one human being can
commit towards another. But it takes
movies like Gciitlciiian' Agreement to re»
mind us that ramsm exists in many forms.
