Not rea_dy for
prime-time academics

by Bob Stryke'r

I often wonder whether or not college life
is very interesting. I mean, it is possible
that we fool ourselves into believing that
college is stimulating and meaningful? It
is likely that most astronauts and
presidents of large on corporations lead
much more exciting lives than college
students do. But how can we know which
way of life will be most interesting, when
most of us are only iamiliar with me
academic Way of life'.’ The answer to that
question, my dear Watson, is so elemen-
tary that I am surprised you have read this
far. The answer. of course, is: college life
is interesting, if and only if, one of the
three major networks makes a night-time
soap opera about it.

Well, read with me now a major sneak-
preview of the new NBC nighttime snap
titled: “Park Street Blues."

The Main Characters:

Dirk- He has won more athletic letters
than he has played athletic seasons. He
sounds and looks like the ‘Addams
Family’s Lurch 7 on speed. He is greedy.

Dean Termite He is a bully, and he is
greedy. '

Irixie. Einstein» She is the grand-
daughter of Albert. She splits atoms in her
spare time. Currently, she is writing the
treatise: “Where Cramps Goofed.” She
shattered the 4.0 limit on the grade point
average. She is greedy.

, Horace Hallik 111- He is a regular guy,

Bore Hall'baked- He is a twit. He knows
everyone. He is rich and greedy.

Ann Razzy- She is a well-adjusted, at—
tractive person.

Ruby Dix0n~ She is a Dead-head.

The scene is the Spring Waltz in Darby
Gymnasium. Couples are swirling
graceiully into one another. Every now
and then two or three people iall down,
creating a great chain reaction.

Dissolve t0 Horace and Trixie smnding
near the refreshment table.

Horace: Gee Trixie, would you like to
waltz with me?

Trixie: (Slowly, she is contemplating the
proposal.) Since I am dressed in Waltzing
attireand since this is a waltz, I give my
consent to you so that we may waltz,

Horace: Swell!

They waltz.

Horace: Hey Trixie! Let me lead for a
While!

Trixie: Horace, i gave you one oppor-
turlity to lead, and you responded by main-
taining a Velocity that I felt would soon
send us careening into the string section!

Horace: Aw, golly!

Dissolve back to the refreshment table

where Dirk is acting as a security guard
for the ball. (We know that because his
(shirt has BALL SECURITY written on
it.) He is pouring as much beer down his
throat as possible. He has obviously taken
it upon himself to drink enough beer so
that no one else may get inebrlated. He is
talking to some large “buddies”.

Dirk: And we got soooo drunk! Biff had
27 and I must have had about 60!

Large Buddy 1: Oh, you‘re a party
machine, Dirk!

Dirk: And after We partied, we beat up
some kid named Horace! (Laughs)

Large Buddy ll: Hehrheh! (Pause) why
did you beat him up?

Dirk: Because his name is Horace!

, large Buddy 11: Oh yeah.

Enter Bore Hallback

Bore: Hi, Dirk! Hey, lsaw you play last
weekend.

Dirk: Hey little buddy! Here, guzzle this
beer.

Bore: But I don’t drink.,.

Dir : Drink!

Bore. Okay. (He sips and cringes)

Dirk: (Pointing at Ann Razzy.) Look at
her. She's purty!

Bore: (In a quick whining nasal) Yea,
that's Ann Razzy. I know her. She’s a Very
nice girl.

Dirk: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna ask her to
dance.

Bore: lwouldn’t do that Dirk, She’s got a
boyfriend at home, and...(He hesitates.)

Dirk (menacingly): AND...What!7

Bore (His teeth are chattering): And,
well, I hear she's sensible.

Dirk lunges at Bore; at this point the
camera rises and retream to reveal the
whole drama in 'the scene from “Park
Street Blues."

Well, maybe life at Grinnell is not all
that exciting. in fact, .you could call it
somewhat predictable. Even so, keep tell-
ing yourself that it is not a bad life at all.
It's all we have. (Sarcasm.)

Making 8

Campus radio personality and political
activist is trying to alter SGA's vision of
itself from the outside. Kopelman, who
considers himself a political moderate,
helped establish the Committee on Student
Politics to process students’ political
resolutions.

The SGA, primarily a money handling
organization, is not involved in national
politics, a situation common in American
colleges. “In oU'ier countries, colleges at»
fect national government. Only in America
are students apathetic," said Kope‘lman in
a Wednesday interview,

Kopelman said that he was trying to
make a “statement" when he proposed his
first resolution to the SGA condemning the
Soviet downing of KAL on. “I jiat wanted
to see what was going to happen when l in-
troduced the resolution to the SGA.” he ad-
ded.

Kopelman’s second, and more cone
troversial, resolution condemned the
Solomon Amendment, which requires

tatemen ts

students receiving financial aid to be
registered for the draft. “This rsolution,”
said Kopelman, “was more important to
our own lives.”

The next step was to establish a commit-
tee to handle such resolutions and make
them acceptable by parliamentary stan~
dards,

Kopelman said the Committee on Stu-
dent Politics’ objective is “to give the stu-
dent government political crcdibility and
to send our resolutions to Congressmen
and other colleges." A long-range goal
Kopelman said is to “set up a network of
politically active colleges.”

In reaction to Kopelman’s activities,
SGA Vice President Peter Hautzinger
said, “It is entirely appropriate for the
SGA to represent students' political
views.” He added that “the Joint Board is
the only representational body that
students have, and we have no one to han»

dle ol't'c 1m tte S.”

A day in the life

by Barry Edwards

It has been said that Grinnell students
are known for their individuality. Despite
the uniqueness of Grinnell students,
however, there is much similarity in their
daily actions. The iollowing is a sample
schedule which you can expect a typical
student to follow with very little deviation.
7 :00 The alarm inevitably goﬁ off and

reminds the student that, like
Iowa farmers, he is destined to get
up more or less with the sun.

The student breaks the alarm
clock and tosses it into the pile
with the several hundred smashed
clocks he has gone through
already. Our determined hero
then begins to ponder whether he
should continue his sleep in bed or
in class.

The student falls fast asleep.
With the help of “the gods”. the
student jumps out or bed and ran-
domly chooses clothes off the pile
on his door. He then staggers to
the bathroom to brush his teeth
and hair.

The student rushes into class and
situates himself in the only empty
chair . in the front of theclass, of
com .

The student falls fast asleep,
“The gods”, once again, come to
ﬁle student’s aid and awaken him
just before class ends.

Our steadfast academidan goes
to the Post Office to stare forlorn—
ly at his empty Post Office box.
Dejected, he walks to his room to
study for his lo:oo class.

He falls fast asleep.

The promise of culinary delight
draws him out of bed, and he
stumbles to the line for lunch.
After finishing his “more
casserole" and baked beans, our
hero heads back to his dorm to
read the paper which has manag-
ed to get strewn about the hall.
The student returns to the Post Of-
fice to find that his PO. Box holds
the vast promises of the Career
Services Bulletin.

After loitering about his hall for
an hour, he goes to his 1:15 class.
For the subsequent hour, he gives

the word "doodle” a new meanr
mg,

Our hero goes back to his room to
collect h,s books and go study in
the library.

He then sorts, stacks, and
ratacks his books in his carrel
and chooses which class he will
study for.

He ialls fast asleep.

The student decides that his Econ.
text makes a miserable pillow and
replaces it with his Calc. text.
Our Grinnellian goes to dinner —
“more casserole" leftDVers and
cream of asparagus soup.

After dinner, he goes to Carnegie
to check for computer messages;
he makes a final check of his Post
Office Box on the way. ’
Adopting a studious mode, our
student goes back to his room to
collect his books for a final assault
on Hurling, Grasping athis rew re
maining moments of freedom, he
procrastinates for 45 minuts talk-
ing to his roommate.

With his backpack sluig over one
shoulder, Mr. Typical claims an
isolated carrel and begins his
evening torture.

Reasoning that coffee is
necessary if he is to remain
awake, the student deems a study
break necessary and strolls to the
forum for coffee and a bagel.

He finishes his bagel and returns
to the Bastion of Knowledge on the
hill to continue his studies.

Our student ponders his books and
absorbs and absorbs income
preherlSible amounts of
knowledge, between writing let-
ters and staring out of the Window.
Deciding that he will never be
caught upphe piles his books into
his backpack and determines that
recuperation is neccessary.

He arrives in the Pub,

The student staggers back to his
room and decides that school isn't
really uiat.bad,
