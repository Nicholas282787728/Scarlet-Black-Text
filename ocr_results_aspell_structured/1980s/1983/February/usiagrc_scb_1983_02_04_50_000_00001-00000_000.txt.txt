Williams claims tests hurt blacks
Psychologist~ calls for end to LQ., SAT tests

by Jeff Raymond

“I just think that the SAT is a profiteer—
ing institution." These words, which may
very well confirm most students’ worst
thoughts about the popular aptitude exam
and the corporation that gives it, were
spoken by Dr. Robert Williams, a PhD. in
clinical psychology from Washington
University, who was on campus last week
as part of Black History Month.

Williams graduated from an allrblack
high school in Little Rock, Ark., with a
good grade average at the age of 16. At 15,
he took a college aptitude test and did so
poorly that his advisor (“He wasn’t an ad-
visor. He was a clown. ”l suggested that he
go into hrickiaying

After a friend noticed his aptitude in
algebra, Williams took the friend’s advice,
enrolled in a local junior college and
graduated at the top of his class. He pure
sued his education and ulimately became a
respected psychologist.

That college aptitude test, was, like so
many others that exist today, culturally
biased, according to Williams. He points to
the perennially low scores of black
students taking the SAT as evidence of this
bias. “The SAT is not an ellective predic-
tor” of success in college, Williams said.
He added, “IQ. tests should be eliminated,
period."

Williams said that under the present

 

system of education in the United States. it
would not be possible to construct a non

Can Adelman

by Jeff Borg

Reaction to the appointment of Kenneth
Adelman, a 1967 graduate of Grinnell Col-
lege, as the new director of the Arms Con-
trol and Disarmament Agency has been
mixed. both nationally and in the campus
community. Adelman, pending confirmar
tion in the Senate, will replace former
director Eugene Rostow, who resigned at
the request of the President Ronald
Reagan.

Ironically, Adelman's decidedly conser-
vatlve views are likely to arouse some op-
position at his alma mater, as they did last
tell when he returned to Grinnell to deliver
the Sept. 9 Scholars’ Convocation,
Speaking about his experiences as deputy

' representative of the United States to the
United Nations. 3 position which he assum-
ed in the summer of 1981, Adelman outlin-
ed the problems that the US. delegation
has laced, such as the emergence of blocs
and the growing cynicism among the
member nations, while holding out little
hope for the future.

Adelman argued against divestment
from corporations operating in South
Africa in an interview on KDIC. Ina visit
to Professor of Political Science H. Wayne
Mayer's class on international relations,
he made it clear that the basic premise of
the president's foreign policy is a profound
mistrust of the Soviet Union, a premise
which he also shares,

Adelman's appointment came as a sure
prise to most political observers, since he
is without great experience in the area of
disarmament. A recent article in “Time"
magazine labeled Adelman “an arms con-
trol neophyte," His expertise seems to he
elsewhere, notably in African affairs.

Adelman spent two and one-half years in
Zaire working on his dissertation and was
chief liaison officer [or the Zaire River Exp
pedition. He has published a book Arricali
Realities (1980) and an article in
“Harper's Magazine" (July, 1981) entitled
“The Great Black HopeiRichard [I of
Tanzania," in which he compares Tamar
nian President Julius Nyerere to the
Shakespearean character.

Analysts generally agree that Secretary

biased aptitude test. Only by standardizing
the curriculum nationwide would it be
possible to make a bias-tree test. He said
that criterionrreferenced tests. which
measure knowledge in a speciﬁc area, are
more desirable to use as scholastic
barometers.

To point out the effects of bias, Williams
created the Black Intelligence Test of
Culture Homegeneity (BITCH), which
consists of 100 black slang terms. Accorr
ding to Williams, the BITCH test proves

that blacks can do well in standardized
tests. He did not mean for it to be an actual
intelligence test but to dramatize the
testing bias.

Colleges should, according to Williams,
look more at high school grades and pay
more attention to “non-academic predic~
tors" such as recommendations, activities
and essays for entrance determinants, He
said that, ideally, all colleges should con»
duct their admissions on a lottery basis to
be more fair. “Colleges are going to have
to be more open to making mistakes in ad-
missions," he declared.

williams felt that while it did not solve
the problems facing black athletes in col-
lege, the new NCAA rule requiring stricter
academic guidelines in admissions would
help the students. He also indicated that,
as a result, more blacks will enroll in all-
black colleges, which are not members of
the NCAA.

If nothing else, he said, the new measure
will force schools to give athletes an
education and improve the very low rate of
graduation for black athletes, He echoed
Penn State Football Coach Joe Paterno’s
comment that schools are ”raping" the
black athletes of this country.

In addition, Williams stated that he
wished that athletics would be deem-
phasized by blacks He said that too many
young athletes see sports as an end, rather
than as a means to an end.

direct an arms agreement?

and that the secretary will now have a
more dominant influence over arms con
trol negotiations because of the youth and
the inexperience oi Adelman,

The departure of Rostow leaves Paul
Nitze, presently the American negotiator
at the mutual force reduction talks in
Geneva, as the only major figure in the
disarmament bureaucracy with any broad
experience in dealing with the Russians.
Thus, the Reagan administration is seen
by some analysts to be “unusually thin at
the top on arms control issues,” since
those in power are unfamiliar with the
specific issues of strategic arms negotia-
tions. ,

News Analysis

Adelman could not be reached in his
New York office on Wednesday. He was
reportedly preparing (or his second Senate
hearing to be held Thursday A week
earlier, Adelman was given a cool recepr
tion by Republican and Democratic
senators alike. They were doubtful of his
credentials and unimpressed by his
responses to serious questions about
Reagan's arms control motives. Senator
Alan Cranston (Dem, Calif.) was par-
ticularly vocal in his opposition to
Adelman's appointment. However, it
seems unlikely that the committee will re
ject Adelman.

On campus, Professors of History Alan
Jones and Joe Wall, who lunched with
Adelman last September, both indicated
their disagreement with his political
views. Jones was not optimistic about the
chances of an arms control agreement,
given Adelman’s hard line approach.
“He's committed to certain beliefs about
the role of the U.S. in the world which I
believe are misguided.” Wall expressed
the hope that Adelman would truly commit
himself to disarmament, since it is one of
the most serious and pressing issues faced
today.

Moyer, who played a major role in last
semester's disarmament symposium, of-
tered his views or Adelman's appointment.
0n the positive side, Adelman's personalir
ty may work to his advantage. in the fall.

Moyer found him to be “personable,
honest, not arrogant and to a certain ex
tent courageous" in his Willingness to state
his views to less than sympathetic au-
diences, The 69-yearrold Rostow, as he
neared the end of his career, had become
set in his ways and had few friends left in
the administration. Adelman might be
able to work more efficiently for disarmar
ment within the present system. Reagan's
claim that he was merely “streamlining
the process" by firing Rostow might then
have some validity.

The question is whether Adelman is flex-
ible enough in his views to make headway
toward an agreement, or even whether he
can afford to be flexible given his situa-
tion. Adelman, Moyer expects, will be “on
a very short leash," Moreover. Moyer is
discouraged by the political aspects of
Adelmans appointment. He sees Adelman
as “a political figure without credentials,
appointed because his views are those of
the president.” Moyer continued, ”Ideally,
the director of the ACDA should be a figure
who stands above politics, which up until
the Reagan administration had, tor die
most part, been true Disarmament is too
important an issue to be politicized." _

Wednesday evening the Student Govern-
ment Association kicked off the new year
with its first Joint Board meeting of the
spring semester. It became apparent im—
mediately that the face of the board had
changed considerably.

Hall presidential elections held in most
dorms last Monday night with a few runoff
elections held Tuesday night ushered in a
great many new representatives. or the 22
representatives on the board, only five fall
semester representatives were reelected
or returned.

Michaelene Kelly, one of the five
representatives returning from last
semester, said she really wasn’t surprised
that so few representatives returned. 'She
said, “Serving on Joint Board can be
frustrating because expectations about
what can be accomplished and actual at?
complishmens arewidely different." Keir
1y said that she, too, had seriously con-
sidered not running, but iterated,
”Nonetheless, I feel that we do accomplish
some significant things, and I feel that
makes it worthwhile."

Dibble Hall President Scott Brennan,
another veteran of the fall semester, said
he was returning because his dorm asked
him. He also said, “I didn’t mind being
president as much as some people did."
Brennan also suggested that the spring
semester of Joint Board ”had to get bets
ter! ”

Newly-elected Younker Hall President
Karen Rose said that she ran for president
because she d|dn't feel that the time com-
mitment other presidents complained
about would be a problem for her. Rose’s
newlyelected hall co-president Mike Mar-
cus felt that it was as good a time as any to
get involved.

Finance Committee Chairperson Vern
Juel stated that the student endowment
would be placed under the Board of
Trustees' Finance Committee. Juel added
that the money in the endowment would
not, however, be invested in South African
interests, in agreement with an sch
resolution of the 1931-82 school year,
divesting students’ endowment money
from South Africa.

The new business bylaw was suspended
in order to approve the budget tor the Main
Hall Event Main Hall President Jeff
Schmidt asked for a suspension of the
bylaw, stating that the budget was submitr
ted for the minutes but did not come out
because of a mix-up. The budget was
unanimously approved.

Student Publications and Radio
Chairperson Richard Letchinger reported
that the papers had been filed for the in-
crease of KDIC wattage. He added, “It will
still be a considerable amount of time
before the actual increase will be
installed.”

The meeting ended with SGA President
Jon Moffet informing Joint Board that a
bill is currently pending in the Iowa State
Legislature for increasing the drinking
age to 2i. Moffet expressed his own and the
administration's concern that the increase
in the drinking age would greatly affect
the campus, especially the status of the
