Dilema, proposal,

by Nathan Anderson

Guest
Opinion

The Trustees and Administrators of
Grinnell College are confronted with a
dilemma, The Solomon Amendment to the

_ i979 registration law stipulates that no
male student may receive federal finan-
cial aid if he has not registered for the
draft. The College has gone on record as
opposing the amendment, but by deciding
to comply with it Grinnell has created
other problems for itself. One such pror
blem is the dilemma of whether or not to
financially support those non-registrants
who have lost federal financial aid.

on the surface of the issue no dilemma is
apparent. Recently, President Drake easi-
ly listed six reasons why the college should
not support non-registrants:

a) The money would have to come either
by increasing the fees of other students or
by taking money from the program.

b) People who decide to break the law
out of conscience must personally bear the
consequences.

c) A “multiplying effect" could occur if
replacement aid were offered. That is, if
the opportunity of aid was given to some,
others may refuse to register and demand
aid, This would place unforeseen
monetary demands on the College.

d) There is a possibility that Grinnell

leave due to financial hardship, the stu-
dent body will become less diverse and
Grinnell will betray its historical idealsl A
lack of concern will be shown toward both
an important social issue and individual
expression, and much of what makes Grin-
nell ”Grinnell" will have been ignored.

Unfortunately, the horn represented by
the President’s arguments seems just as
hard and menacing. A Sacrifice of princi~
pie and possibly money seems inevitable
no matter what the Trustees and Ad-
ministrators decide.

i would like to propose a way out of this
dilemma that entails minimal sacrifice of
either money or principle on the College's
part. What i suggest is this:

The Board of Trustees of Grinnell Col
lege should allow an increase of money-to
flow from Grinnell's endowment into the
budget. This money would be used to
create a fund to make loans to non-
registrants who have lost federal aid.

With a few more qualifications, such an
act would prove an escape from the dilemr
ma that confronts the College. Setting up
the fund would obviously show Grinnell’s
concern for diversity, social issues, and in-
dividuality. It could also be the answer to
the college's present objections to suppor~
ting non-registrants.

a) Loan money would be replaced to the
college, so no real loss of funds would oc-
cur over time. Because the money would
come directly from the endowment, cur-
rent students and the academic program
would not suffer.

b) Non-registrants would personally

could lose all its federal funding if it aided
nonregistranfs,

e) Institutions should not break the law,
but work to change bad ones.

f) Grinnell has no inherent pacificistic
tradition.

The argument, then, seems to run
heavily in favor of‘ not helping non-
registrants overcome money problems. In-
deed, this has been the Trusteﬁ and Ad-
ministrators’ position up to this point.

The six reasons that Mr. Drake
presented, however, present only half the
story. As Drake himself has acknowledg-
ed, Grinnell is dedicated to maintaining a
diverse student body. Further, according
to the lessor Catalogue, “[if] the future of
a college can be found in its past, concern
wiﬂl Social issues, educational innovation,
and individual expression will continue to
shape Grinnell." The dilemma here
displays in horns. ll Grinnell does not sup-
port its non-registrane and Hey must

sacrifice for their beliefs by paying a
larger amount of money to attend Grin-
nell. As someone has suggested to me, the
loan fund would protect this sacrifice and
the school‘s interests at me same time.

c) The ”multiplying effect" could be
overcome if it occurred. First, it should be
pointed out again that all funds will be
replaced. Second, the Trustees could set
an upper limit on the amount of money
that would flow into the fund. If more
federal aid needs to be replaced than is
available in the fund, the amount of aid
could be distributed on a percentage basis
to students (e,g,, each student would
receive 75 percent of his lost aid). Of
course. the amount in the fund would have
to represent a realistic attempt to solve
Grinnell-s problem.

d) It would seem that for the school to
legally lose all aid for helping a student, a
law would have to be passsed dsignatlng
such action as illegal and tying the penalty

of college aid lost to that offense. Earlham
College, which is supporting its non-
registrants with loans, work, and outright
gifts, has said that they feel such action is
improbable. aarlham is understandably
concerned with the possibility of such a
law, but a financial aid officer from the
school informed me that the only proposal
to that effect “never reached the floor” of
Congras. It seems unlikely that it ever
will, in View of the pressure now being exV
erted on Congress by colleges such as
Earlham and Grinnell on this issue. If such

. a law were to be passed by Congress, Grin-

nell could refuse to give out further loans
once it was enacted. Prosecution of
previous support would be ex post facto
law.

According to Mr. Hopkins, Director of
Admissions and Financial Aid, a more
serious threat is the simple “refiguring” of
Grinnell's allocation by the federal
government. The burden of proof would
then rest on Grinnell to prove that the
amount was decreased due to Grinnell's
loan fund activrty. This risk should be
evaluated, but it should also be noted such
action on the federal government's part
would be illegal, Further, Grinnell has
already been active enough on this issue to
have raised the U.S, Government’s ire,
and no reduction has yet been seen. To be
continuously forced into non-action by the

threat of federal aid reduction is not the

future Grinnell envisions for itself.

e) Unless me law discussed was passed,
it does not seem that Grinnell would be
breaking any specific law, but legal con-
sultation should be taken to see if other
laws could be stretched to punish Grinnell.
The legal case is not clear-cut, and in this
situation Grinnell should be alert to legali-
ty, but not intimidated by technicality.

f) While Grinnell has no inherent
pacifistic beliefs, its dedication to diversi-
ty and individuality are well known and
often expounded upon by the College itself.
The action would be taken for those goals,
not for the sake of pacifism.

The loan fund proposal is put forward as
one possible solution to the dilemma that
faces the Trustees and Administrators of
Grinnell. I feel that it is the bat option
available to preserve Grinnell's ideals.
More likely solutions may exist with less
risks involved than in my proposal.
Therefore, a challenge is issued in good
faith to the already concerned Ad-
ministrators and Trustees to find a better
plan to protect Grinnell’s idmls and in
terestsl If a better proposal cannot be
found, then the Trustees and Ada
ministrators must work to make the loan
fund a reality.

 

Letters

To the Editor:

After reading Leon Louse’s “Alternative
Parents' Weekend Calendar," I was hour
amazed and disgusted. Mr. Louse ap-
parently has no respect for the fact that
the College tries very hard to Create a
weekend which is both informative and ens
joyable for students and parents alike.

Perhaps Mr. Louse‘s parents did not at-
tend this year, but for those parents who
spent a lot of time and money to come, his
“humorous" response to the event was
despicable. The article' was offensive to
many distinguished members of the Grin~
nell community as well as an insult to the
entire College community.

It not only reflects the sophomorie sense
of humor of Mr, Louse, but also of the
editor of the Scarlet and Black. Who is
Leon Louse? I looked him up in the student
directory and he was not listed. Well,
whoever you are, i hope you and the editor
take a long hard look at yourselves and
reflect on the damage you have done to the
entire institution. Maybe then you’ll see
how stupid and insensitive your smut realr
1y is, —— Best wishes, Daniel Klatz

To the Editor:

This is certainly not ﬁre first time this
semester that I‘ve been tempted to write
you and point out certain glaring inac-
curacies in your paper. After reading your
edition of September 30, however, I was
glad that I hadn't written previously. In
your editorial entitled “A comedy of epic
proportions" you have truly outdone
yourself.

In the aforementioned editorial you say
“Never to dissapoint. the members of the
JOlnt Board are soliciting student opinion
on curricular change. it is their hope that
an overwhelmingly negative student
response to the propsoal will instill fear in
the hearts of the faculty.” Nothing could
be further from the truth. The ad hoc coma
mittee on curricular change was formed
with the express intent of developing an
organized student body response to the
Parslow proposal.

Before we attempted to do this, we
thought it might be a good idea to rind out
just exactly how most students feel about
the proposal. Distributing a questionnaire
to the student body struck us as a logical
place to start. When we were drawing up
the questionnaire every effort was made to
be certain that it contained no leading or
