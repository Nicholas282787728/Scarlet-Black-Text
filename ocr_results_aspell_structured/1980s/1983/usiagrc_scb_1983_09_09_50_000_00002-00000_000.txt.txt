Mondale wins

in campus poll

by Debbie Saegei

Former VicePresident Walter Mondale
emerged as the leading Presidential can-
didate on campus in a straw poll conducted
by the Office of College Relations earlier
this week. Mondale’s 39 percent ol the vote
outdistanced US. Senator Gary Hart
(Dem-Colo) with 22 percent of the vote
and US. Senator John Glenn (Dem.-Ohio)
with to percent. Jesse Jackson, placing
third in many national polls, was able to
draw only 7 percent of the vote, In the
Republican poll, Vice-President George
Bush overpowered President Reagan 2 to
l, garnering 40 percent of the vote to
Reagan’s 20 percent among Grinnell
Students.

Democratic presidential hopefuls faired
well in head to head competition with
Repubican candidates. Mondale soundly
defeated Reagan with an overwhelming 77
percent of the vote. He was also highly suc-
cessful against Vice-President Bush, winns
ing handily, 67 percent to 33 percent

Glenn, too, proved a strong contender
against the Republicans, defeating
Reagan by capturing 78 percent to
Reagan’s 22 percent. Bush faired slightly
better than Reagan with 37 percent, but
still fell far short of Glenn’s commanding
63 percent.

Grinnell Police said Wednesday they
have two suspects in connection with'ins
cidents last weekend in which Grinnell Col-
lege students were awakened by intruders
in their dormitory ro’oms. No students
were injured.

One of the suspects was arrested on
campus early Wednesday and charged
with criminal trespassing, Grinnell patrol
officer, David Sears said.

A second man is also being sought, Sears
said, but would not release further details
about him or about the college incidents
which occurred early Saturday

Students in North and South Younker
Halls reported five separate intrusions,

Lynn Haller,,a freshman living in North
Younkcr said a man walked in her room
about 315 am. Saturday,

"One roommate wasn't home yet and
the other roommate was sleeping in the
next bed. I woke up and there was this man
leaning over my bed,” Haller said. “He in-
troduced himself and said he just wanted
to talk. He told me I should keep my doors
locked. He said he was looking for 507
means to party with, He said he wanted to
meet me again sometime that day, I said I
didn't really want to meet him,”

Lisa van Sand, ’85. and Meg Philpott, '56,
reported similar incidents, Both expressed
fear

The poll indicated that Vice-President
Bush, according to Grinnell students, was
a stronger candidate against Mondale and
Glenn than his boss, President Reagan.

Student reaction to the poll results was
mixed, Guy Montag of the College
Republicans thought it interesting that
Bush received so much support. since he
plans to withdraw from the race should
President Reagan choose to run for reelec-
tion. Montag was also pleasantly surprised
at the showing of other Republican can-
didates. “in the past, people tended to
associate hard-line Republican Stands
with all Republican candidates," said
Montag, indicating a possible change in
student political mought,

Nikki Moore, chairman of the Campus
Democrats, offered an explanation for
Gary Hart’s surprising strength. She said,
“He was well received during his visit to
the campus last year. and there is a lot of
solid support on campus for Hart."

The effects of the straw poll will not be
known for sometime William Deminoff,
Director of College Relations said, “I
have a hunch that Grinnell College ls a bell
weather at times,H

Political Science Professor Jonathan
Hurwitz noted Grinnell College's reputa~
tion for liberalism and said, “This poll
isn’t all that indicative of the rest of the
country."

Andrea Whitman, '85. described her ver-
bal confrontation with 3 Voyeur through
her window. After talking with a friend in
Whitman's room, she walked her friend
home and prepared for bed. At 3 am,
Whitman said she was sitting on her bed
studying

“I heard this voice: “Hello, Andrea, I'm
Tony.‘ " She said the man continued,
“Don’t be afraid; [Just want to talk to you
7 I just want you to let me in and hide
me."

whitman commented, “The only way he
could have known my name was hom
listening to my friend. He had seen the
whole thing. lwas really scared.” She said
that she left the room and when she came
back, he was gone. Sears explained, "In
almost all the cases we've come across
there hasn’t been a public onense other
than the entry of an unlocked room."

Officer Sears said that entry into unlock-
ed rooms would constitute criminal
trespass which is a misdemeanor. The
penalty would he 30 days in jail or a $100
fine.

"We might be a small town but things
can still happen, but a few precautionary
measures are relatively simple and could
eliminate the problem,"

Joint Board discusses
security problems

by M, Wolfgang Schumann

The Joint Board on Wednesday night
discussed at length the door-closing habits
of tin-campus residents, the downing of a
South Korean jetliner, and members' reac
tion to both. The proposed core curriculum
was given to an ad-hoc committee for
study.

The recent security breach involved in
truders in Younkers l-iall early Saturday
who entered students‘ rooms and frightens
ed female residents, according to police
reports, Students also reported seeing soc
meone in Read Hall and Brown House,

While the intruder was called harmless
by most of the people involved, his
unwelcome visits pointed out a serious proV
blem in campus security. A lengthy discus
sion of the closed door policy in dorr
mitories led to suggestions for lines to
halls for doors left open after set hours.

Younker President Mike Marcus com~
plained of a lackadaisical attitude that
allowd a man to enter though a jammed»
open door, Marcus said he didn’t think it
was too much to ask someone to carry
their key at night.

The other Younker President John
Gerhardy brought up another aspect of the
problem. He said many of these people
whose rooms are entered were very
frightened and none called the police, an
RA. or an on duty dean. Gerhardy said he
also discussed it with the police, who
where willing to visit campus to talk about
security during study breaks. SGA Social
Coordinator Bethe Keegan added that
there are “weirdos” out there and en-
couraged people to use the EscortService.

Core Curriculum

Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazer
agreed to an open forum with students to
discuss proposed core curriculum. Frazer,
Professor Morris Parslow, and one other
faculty member of administration will
discuss the planned changes, which will
not directly affect students now attending
Grinneil. The faculty will vote by the end
of the semester and is said to be divided
with a large faction in favor of some form
of core Curriculum. A semi»closed meeting
will be held with students on Sept, 26.

Joint Board VicesPresident Pete HautzV
inger, said he is establishing an ad-hoc
committee to organize and voice student
opinion over the proposed changes Hautz-
inger said the administration would decide
the core curriculum issue it Joint Board
didn’t act. Joint Board is planning to spend
about fifty dollars to make 1,200 copies of
the proposal to distribute to every student
on campus, pending approval of the
Finance Committee

In other action, Joint Baord discussed
students’ reaction to last week's dawning
of a South Korean jetliner. South Younker
resident David Kopleman introduced a
resolution condemning the Soviet Union's
attack and urged the Joint Board to write
other colleges to inform them of Grinnell
SGA action. SGA Social Coordinator Bethe
Keegan, an international studies major,
complained that Jomt Board should not
speak for all students and that maybe a
petition would be more appropriate. Some
discussion centered on SGA'S lack of
credibility in matters of foreign affairs,
but it was generally agreed that the resolu-
tion should be considered for a vote next
time,
