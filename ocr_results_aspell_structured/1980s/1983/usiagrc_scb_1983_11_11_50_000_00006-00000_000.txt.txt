By Jean Silveiberg

Game Theory»Pcinted Accounts oi People
You Know EP (Rational Records, 2410 E
3th St. Davis. CA 95615)

Game Theory plays clean sounding,
modern pop with a cynical edge. All the
songs on the E? are solid compositons, but
two, “Metal and Glass Exact” and “l Wane
na Get Hit By a Car" are outstanding.
They are expecially interesting because

they combine innocent pop harmonies with-

pessimistic lyrics, and the effect is
sometimes startling. B (on a purely subjec-
tive scale of 10).

Savage Republice’l‘ragic Figures LP and
”Film Nair/O Andonis" 7" (independent
Project Recordsd, P.O Box 66103, L.A.,
CA 90066)

Savage Republic is a member or the
gloom-and-doom school of post-punk. The
LP, particularly, is primitive and ex-
perimental. The single adds more guitar
and keyboard to the group, rendering it
more palatable to the average taste. Both
records are exotic and interesting, but
neiuier are as exciting as they could he. 7.

Tan Chemicalr’l‘ao Chemical (Tao Vinyl,
PO. BOX 3332, Santa Cruz, CA 95061)

Tao Chemical combines humorous
social commentary and political
awareness with psychedelic art-rock using
Third World rhythms. The whole produc-
tion gets to be somewhat overbearing, but
they redeem themselves by good musie
cianship and songwriting, plus some truly
iunny lines. My iavorite track is “Sick oi
Food“, 7.

Film Shorts

Anyone who enjoyed last year's "Blow
Up" won’t want to miss this weekend's
showing of “L’Avventura" (The Adven~
ture), perhaps director Michelangelo Ann
tonioni's finest film. Considered by many
critics to be one of the ten best films ever
made, this 1960 offering has as its subject
the empty existence or italy's idle rich up-
per class starring Monica vitti, Gabriele
Ferzetti, and Lea Massari, the film
centers around the bizarre disappearance
or a young woman on a yachting trip, and
an ensuing aitair between the woman's
lover and her best friend, The film is a
study or the emotional sterility of modern
existence. of the futility of selfsassertion in
a bewtlderingly technological world, and
of the near impossibility of meaningful
communication with others. Antonioni
uses haunting, lingering shots of his
characters and their symbolic environ
ment to convey a sense or alienation and
psychosexual agony. “L'Avventura” is a
landmark of the cinema, and should not be
missed by anyone who has a serious in
terest in the art of film.

Those interesed in somewhat lighter
tare will enjoy “The Producers" (1963),
Mel Brooks' little-known but hilarious first
iilm, This romp is the story of a Broadway
producer (Zero Mostel) and his bumbling
accountant (Gene Wilder) and their far
fetched scheme to strike it rich by produc-
ing a musical called ”Springtime [or
Hitler” starring a “hip" Hitler, circa 1968.
In Brooks' unfailingly tasteless style, “The
Producers" provides all the laughs one
could hope ior.

“L’Avventura”: Friday 9:30 South
Lounge; Saturday 10:00 South Lounge,

”The Producers": Saturday 10:15 ARI-i;
Sunday 9:30 South Lounge.
