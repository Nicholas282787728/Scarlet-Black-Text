Mail A Forgotten Time

nobody Wins

“How can you ask me about human rights when your country denied
rne freedom of Speech?" So asked Georgi Arbatov last Monday night.
His rhetorical question points to inconsistencies between the U.S. State
Department’s actions and the principle of free speech which it

represents

By flexing its considerable diplomatic muscle, the State Department
dashed a press conference and much other coverage of Arbatov during
his visit here this week. Limiting Arbatov's access to the country
through the mass media, the State Department voided the proud
American tradition of free speech and added tension to the already icy
relations between Arbatov’s country and ours.

iSuch game playing is all too typical of the conduct of the State
Department. Bureaucratic doublespeak and media manipulation are
unfortunate and unnecessary facts of life that clog the diplomatic pro-
cess. Surely a country founded on principles of free speech and free

press can do better.

of course, the Soviet Union makes it a policy to be secretive and un-
truthful in its dealing with the world. However, that is a totalitarian
regime and does not place importance on the same principles we do.
Arbatov is a knowledgeable and effective speaker, but he is also a good
Communist, and he told us what Moscow wanted us to hear.

Despite, or maybe because of, the nature of Arbatov’s statements,
the question we must ask of our State Department is: Why can’t a na-
tional audience hear what Arbatov has to say? It is, after all, un-
constitutional to abridge the rights of free speech of American citizens.
Denying these same citizens access to someone else’s ideas seems

questionable at best.

Surely the State Department did not think it was protecting anyone
from dangerous Communist propaganda. We have all been exposed to
material more dangerous than Arbatov‘s claim of Soviet military
vulnerability and a call for easing tensions between America and the
USSR. Hampering communication between the two countries,
regardless of who is responsible for the problem, does more harm than

good in the end.

By basing their decision on what they call “the principle of reciproci-
ty,” the State Department placed a childish and unnecessary limit on
Arbatov and the media that is indicative of the shortsighted attitudes of

the Reagan administration.

Let’s play monopoly

To the Editor’

It Occurred to me a while ago that the
students now at Grinncll as well as all the
people irom about 15 to 23 have a pretty
large burden on their shoulders. It seems
that those of us born at the tallend of the
“baby-boom" and directly afterwards
have a lot to prove, because most oi the
causes which our older brothers and
sisters iought for, believed in, or at least
remember are only vague memories, if
that, to us. How many of us remember
Judge Julius Hoffman and the Chicago
Seven trial? So here we are, perhaps with
the same moral convictions, perhaps not,
nonetheless. no issue today looms as large
as being sent to a war in Southeast Asia to
motivate us.

Voting on proxy resolutions on South
Africa at stockholders meetings just is not
as glamorous as demonstrating and chan-
ting “Hell no we won’t go! " or even “Poo
ple over prolitsi" Jerry Rubin once said,
“It's got to he more fun in a revolution
than out Of it.H I guess that is true only if
the revolution is a flamboyant one. So here

is the South r‘ill'lczln support Group trying
to work for a quiet. peaceful revolution
with the compromise we negotiated with
the trustees, and we arc having a hard
time getting hall the support we got just
last year We are still here, as is the pro
blcm with which we are concerned. .

Meanwhile In a broader sense. the salne
can be said about the Scarlet and Black.
(Just a couple of weeks ago i read the best
Scarlet and Black I can remember). but
now its very eXistence is threatened.

Finally, to all the people who are
evaluating us in nostalgic, historical
terms, this is 1383, and 1973 will never flap-
pen again. So let us make our peace with
the world just as you, who were born a few
years earlier than we were, have. After
all. I am sure that many of the members of
the class of 1955 were not any happier with
what was happening here in the late 605
and early 705 than those of the class of the
early 705, and those lucky enough to catch
the tailend of that era are about the future
classes of the mid7805_ 7 Sincerely, Hugh

To the Editor:

I enjoyed reading both .iim Gillespie's
letter of April 8, as well as Jon Levin's
response of April 15, Both made some ims
portant points.

Gillespie points out the paradox of the
narrow-minded, “liberal" attitudes of too
many Grinnell students and far too many
faculty members (who should know bet
ter) at what is supposedly a “liberal" in-
stitution.

Levin essentially tells us that what else
can be expected from a “liberal" institu-
tion populated by those who consider
themselves “liberals." I-Ie, unfortunately,

During the Candle Light Vigil outside of
Darby Gym on the night of Dr. Arbatov's
first speech, Bill McCullough and I went
outside to take a look at the demonstration
and mask the reporter outside it he would
like an opposing viewpoint. Some of the
people holding candles nearby began to
become agitated and suggested that
perhaps we were not correct in our views.
Remarks were exchanged and the
reporter decided to do the interview.

While I was being interviewed. certain
people started to loudly sing John
Lennon's "Give Peace a Chance.” I would
like to say that the people that were sing-
ing while I was trying to talk to the
reporter were the salne people. that Bill

On the subject of free speech... did you hear the one about Bernard
Epton? He apparently wants to buy the Chicago Sun-Times. If he does
so, he plans to immediately fire award‘winning columnists Mike Royko
and Roger Simon. Nice to know the man doesn‘t believe in holding a
grudge. While it’s hardly our place to tell the man how to spend his
money, this type of, dare we say, suppression is hardly what you would
call “democratic.” But then again, what more can you expect for so-
meone who doesn‘t even have the courtesy to show up for the postelec-
tion “unity luncheon.” Chicago was saved “before it was too late” —

written by Samuel chun. In my opinion the
article was illustrative of only a poor at-
tempt at intellectualizing. As such. the ar—
ticle reﬂected a lack of insight and ex-
treme naivete on the part of the writer. To
Samuel Chun i would like to say, open your
eyes and think before you speak and com-
ment on what may not be clear to you.

If there are others out there who might
have been confused and/or made uncom»
fortable by statements made by several
black students and myself in the article
“Shades of Racism: The Covert, The Blue
taut 7 The Problem Exists." V01 91, No.
21, here are a few suggestions for you.

First, realize that some ambiguity may
have been due to the fact that ellipses
marks, in a quotation, may have been in-
appropriately placed. Consequently, the
reader may have missed the elaboration
necessary for her or him to “see the light."

Second, if you are still troubled, make an
attempt to speak with the person who
wrote the article. Even better yet, you

Third, do not ever take quotations wi
ellipses at face value and critique them
For if your interpretations are not quit
accurate, you may be made to look th-
fool. In conclusion, the above suggestion
are seriously made to help one avoid th.
trap of pseudo-intellectualism.

In addition, I would like to suggest the

time intelle‘ctualizing. it anyone ever ha

result, we may become really liberal.

Liberal in the sense that we both ma
learn to question our own beliefs and worl:
views and examine the effects that such at

the consequences of our belief system

would men truly be liberal and not so who
it is only convenient to be, which is so cite
the case. — Sincerely, Karen L Ellison
