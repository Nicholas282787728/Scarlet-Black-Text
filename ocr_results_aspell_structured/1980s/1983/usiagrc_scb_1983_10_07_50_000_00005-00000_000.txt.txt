“Over breakfast coffee we read of 40,000
dead Americans in Vietnam. Instead of
vomiting, we reach for the toast.

An equation: 40,000 dead young men =
3,000 tons of bone and flesh, 124,000 pounds
of brain matter, 50,000 gallons of blood,
l,840,000 years of life that will never be liv-
ed. 100,000 children who will never be born.

Dalton Trumbo. Johnny Got His Gun

Dalton Trumbo wrote that in 1970. Now,
thirteen years later, the United states has
a standing army of some 2.1 million peo-
ple; you can figure out your own equation
There are American soldiers on every cons
tinent with the possible exception of An-
tarctica. In the last ﬂ'iree weeks, four
American soldiers have been shot and the
United States Navy has shelled at least one
Lebanese city. In the last three weeks,
Congress has legalized nerve gas for use in
warfare and Congress has approved a

weighted questions. We checked this on a
number of occasions with members of the
Psychology and Sociology departments. At
no time have we had any intent or hope of
receiving an “overwhelmingly negative
response." Our only intent has been to get
as accurate an idea as possible‘of what
students opinion is on this topic. As a mat
ter of fact, we‘ve made it clear that the
questionnaire ls more for our benefit than
the faculty's; that we plan to use the infor-
mation gathered by it to initiate the kind of
“rational discourse” you apparently
desire.

All of this should have been painfully 0b.
vious to you. Mr. Editor. Not only did I
discuss the questionnaire personally with
you in the Pub, but you also were present
at the only Joint Board meeting that
discussed the questionnaire in depth At no
time was any mention made of the kind of
response we were hoping to receive. The
only hope expressed was that we get a
large response, to lend credibility to
whatever the results were I have ab~
soluteiy no idea where you got the idea that
we were hoping for a negative response, or
even that we are necessarily opposed to
the proposal.

It is clear that we as students are pro»
bably not going to have a great deal of in-
fluence on the faculty’s decision We have
been engaged in a good faith effort to en.
sure that the faculty is a least aware of our
feelings on the matter. By taking advan»
tage of your position as Editor to ridicule
and demean our efforts to give the student
body at least some voice in the faculty's
decision, you have only managed to make

, our task that much more difficult. Icould
understand your position if your writing
was based on facts. Unfortunately, it was
not, and I can only find this depressing and
disturbing. 7 Sincerely. Pete Hautzinger.

record 186,5 billion dollar military budget;
that is eight zeros, by the way. currently,
the United States is not at war.

Many people believe that this killing and
preparation for mass destruction should
be stopped. A few Grinnell students are go-
ing to try to do something about it. On Oct.
16, ten to twepty students plan to stage a
direct act of civil disobedience at Offet Air
Force Base in Omaha, Neb., the home of
the Strategic Air Command (S.A.C.) Head-
quarters, This is also where the “Looking
Glass” airplanes are stationed, The
“Looking Glass" planes are designed to be
airborne military command posts in the
event of the disabling of the land based
posts. There has been a “Looking Glass"
plane in the air for the last twentyrfive
years, twentyafour hours a day, three hunr
dred and sixty-five days a year to coorr
dinate a nuclear attack should Ute presia
dent deem one necessary. The pilots of the

.“Looking Glass” planes wear black eye-
patches over their left eyes so mat in case
of a nuclear blast near them, they can
remove their eye patch and still see out of
one eye. Comforting, hunh? Pardon the
digression.

These students who are going to Omaha
do not believe that simply acknowledging

their beliefs and maybe telling a few
friends is enough. They believe that as con»
cerned humans, they have an obligation to
publicly demonstrate their beliefs so as to
inform others, and they believe that they
should do everything in their power to stop
this mass insanity. That is why they are
going to S.A.C. to demonstrate,

The people who are going will be ap-
prehended and detained by Air Force per-
sonnel. This will ConSist of receiving a
“Ban and Bar" letter, which informs each
person that he is permanently denied err
trance onto the base, and each person will
be charged with a petty offense and have
to give the Air Force his name, address,
and other pertinent information for later
identification purposes if he should break
the “Ban and Bar" letter.

This penalty could prove rather severe
in ‘the future, especially if someone who
protests wishes to hold a United States
Government job or work for any company
with a government contract. This is a for
midable obstacle to protesting, but most of
the protesters believe that they would
rather not be employed by a government
which they perceive as drastically im-
moral, “Under a government which ima
prisons any unjustly," said Henry David

All this and the Australia II

by Jeff Raymond

Maybe now, while most of the world’s
,navies are being drydocked and outfitted
with winged keels, we can sit back and
take a look at the events surrounding
September 26, the date of the deciding race
of the America's Cup challenge.

Okay, so you didn‘t lose a lot of sleep
worrying about whether John Bertrand
was up to the challenge of sailing against
Dennis Connor, and the state of Iowa didn't
collectively hold its breath until the Clay
when the world could see Ben Lexcen's ins
novative bulbous, winged keel on the boat
he designed, But chances are pretty good
that you heard of some of those names and
maybe for the first time you spent some
time actually finding out about this
America's Cup thing.

The fact that the race was played up so
dramatically says a great deal about this
year's Cup challenge. There simply aren‘t
that many people in America outside of
Newport, RI, that care too much about
the'whole thing, and rightly so.

The Cup is contested every three years,
and the American entry in the champion
ship series has won it every time since
1851, As far as a time frame goes, that is
the longest winning streak in the history of
sport. in fact, that winning streak is, or
should I say was, older than many ex-
isiting sports altogether. So there was real-
ly no reason for most people to get all chokr
ed up about another defense of the Cup.

Now that the America’s Cup sits in a
display case in Perth. Australia, people
have begun to think a little about the race.
The New York Yacht Club (NYYC), which
possessed the Cup all this time, thinks it
stinks, and the Royal Perth yacht Club.
which now holds the Cup, thinks it's great
The merchants of Newport aren't exactly
dancmg in the streets because they will
lose millions in revenue every three years
until the Americans regain the Cup

The NYYC officials behaved absymally
all summerlong. Their first childish action
came when they claimed that Australia II
was not designed under Australian
auspices That’s bull. The boat was deSIgnA
ed by Ben Lexcen, an Aussie. End of argu-
ment,

 

Their worst deed, though, turned an un-

successful defense-of a yachting chama
pionship into a national embarrassment.
The NYCC officials waited a day before
surrendering the Cup to the Australia 11
crew and the Royal Perth Yacht Club, then
mumbled their congratulations before
returning to the club to lick their wounds

You’d think that these filthy»rich im-
beciles would grow up a little and behave
like sportsmen. Even the vanquished Rus
sian hockey team waited patiently to con
gratulate the American team in the 1980

' Olympics while the victors revelled in

their accomplishment.

In winning the Cup. the Australians ins
jected some badly needed life into a fre
quently stuffy, obscure, rich-man's sport.
Even Mldwesterners who will never see a
twelvermeter yacht race — or ever care to
see one — found reason over the past
weeks to discuss the event, even if all they

m

said was that they didn't care who won.
The point is that the success of Australia
ll was so astounding (we're talking page
one of the Washington Post) that it aroused
an awareness that, for the most part,
hadn’t existed before.
Does this mean that we should forget

. everything, move to a coast and learn how

to sail twelve-meter yachts? Of course not,
It doesn't even mean that we have to
become boat racing fans.

But it should demonstrate that there is
room in our lives to try something new,
like the Australians, and strive for an ac-
complishment that seems so elusive.
There are plenty of reasons not to walk out
on a limb and take a risk, but it's hard not
to be inspired by someone who does. The
story of Australia II and the people involve
ed in its success is definitely inspiring.

Thoreau, “the proper place for a just man
is also in prison," At least one person has
been sentenced to prison for refusing to
register with the Selective Service Many
believe this an unjust sentence. They
believe that it is their duty to right this
wrong or refuse to honor a government
which is imprisoning people unjustly,

This potential mass destruction is the
most important issue of our time. and it is
something which every one should con-
sider carefully, Thoreau also said, “Cast
your whole vote, not a piece of paper mere-
ly, but your whole influence."

men

by Alan Abrams

Men are people too. why a women's
movement and not a men’s movement?
Typically people answer like this: Women
need a women's group because society ops
presses women as a group; society does
not oppress men as a group.

while it may be true that society
discriminates in favor of men in an
economic sense, in a cultural and personal
sense our society oppresses men just as
much e if not more — than it oppresses
women.

Men are still bound by the chains of op
pressive and archaic sex roles from which
women have been freeing themselves for
the last couple of decades.

Women are now free to choose between
”traditional" male and female sex roles,
but our society will still not accept men
making these same choices. It's all right
for a woman to be a breadwinner or a
homemaker; it's all right for a woman to
wear makeup or not to wear makeup; it's
all right for a woman to wear a skirt or for
a woman to wear pants; it's all light for a
woman to kiss another woman without be-
ing accused of being a homosexual or a
“fairy".

But, in our society, it's not all right for a
man to make these choices between sex
roles or to show affection toward another
man.

Men need a men's group because men
need to be treated like people with feels
ings, not like some kind of cold, inhumane
breadwinning machine.

Men need a men's group to free
themselves, to make the right choices for
themselves. If a man loves to care for
Children he should feel free to become a
househusband, just as women feel free to
become housewives,

Men need to become aware of their
rights to be themselves. Men shouldn’t feel
that they have to become some kind of
John Wayne or clint Eastwood.

Men need a men's group for the same
reasons that women need a women‘s
group: to help themselves to live more
complete and satisfying lives
