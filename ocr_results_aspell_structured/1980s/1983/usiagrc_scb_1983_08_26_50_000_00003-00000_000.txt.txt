Editor’s Note: The following or»
ticle was submitted by the
President and Vice President of
the Student Government
Association, Jon Schurff and

Peter Hautzinger, respectively.

Yes, The Student Government Associa-
tion does have an important function. Its
primary role for the students is to provide
necessary services such as concerts,
weekly tilms, all campus parties, funds for
study breaks, and funding for special in
terest groups. The most important fact
about SGA is that 95 percent of the funding
comes from the students.

A quick structural description of the
SGA will show that students do have a role
in this organization. Each hall has a presi-
dent and off-campus housing has two
representatives. The hall presidents com,
prise Joint Board, which is the legislative
branch of SGA. This body controls all of
the decisions that SGA makes. Joint Board
meets every Wednesday evening at 7: 30 in
ARH 11. (Meetings begin this Wednesday.)
Everyone is welcomed to attend and freely
express his opinion. An agenda of upcomr
ing Joint Board meetings will be posted in
the post office. After each meeting your
hall president will post the minutes of the
meeting In turn, the students have a
respons ility to inform their president of
their opinions and concerns. Students must
express their opinions and participate in
this process for SGA to be a student
organization. After all, it is the Student
Government Association.

In the past, the SGA has been criticized
for being solely a funding organization.
Yes, that is its primary purpose.
Nevertheless, the SGA can take stands on
certain issues, but to do this it must know
the opinion of the students, Give your sins
dent government a chance by para
ticipating.

these figures are limited in importance
since numbers can not possibly gauge the
difference in quality between classes.

In spite of the 6 percent decline in the
number of high school graduates, Barbonl
reported a 12 percent increase in applica-
tions this year. He said that represents a
net gain of 18 percent and that all credit
goes to Admissions, the Office of College
Relations, and all members of the campus
community who represent the college at
functions for prospectives and college
fairs across the nation. ror prospectives
and their parents, the marketing research
determines the best manner in which to
supply them with “the most accurate in-
formation during their most Critical deci-
sion time," said Barboni.

The entire Admissions effort to increase
contact has grown with a three (old in
crease in initial inquiries from prospective
students, up from 10,000 to 30,000 lastyear.
Bartlett stated that market research has
played its part, but he cautioned that some
of these inquiries never progressed past
this initial contact and that the resulting
applicatons in no way affected the high
level of admissions standards held by the
college

Barboni stressed that using a marketing
program is not the same as selling soap,
“Too many people think of marketing as
merely advertising or direct mail cam-
paigning,” he said. ”When you try to sell
something you do not want to tell the buyer
everything about the product. You hide

things by not informing them fully. The

college will never do this," ~

This summer, more than any other I can
remember, the generally horrid state of
popular music in America permiated my
clock radio. Techno this, syntho that. . I
began having hallucinations. My bedroom
became a computer reference center ﬁlled
with programmers and technicians. Oh,
the horror of it all.

Alas, there was a bright spot in this
maze of electronic garbage: three young
men from Milwaukee known to the world
as Violent Femmes.

New Musical Express called him,
"Natural heir to the funk throne of Bootsy
and George [Clinton]," and described his
music as “Powerful grass roots funk, franc
tic rhythms conjure up confusion and
sirins of the scene. latent violence being
communicated, total cominittinent, and
definite edge "

While gaining a large following in
England, Prince Charles has gone vil'tuals
ly unnoticed in this country. His "Stone
Killers" collection is available only on
cassette, and this is his first lull scale
North American tour.

Yet the future looks very bright for this
23-year~old funkatteer. Saturday is a
chance to catch him steaming up uie lawns

and interesting band to appear on the rock
scene in a while. Their music is a type of
folk rock that recalls the spirit of the great
rock 'n’ roll hands of the '50s The reasons
for the greatness of this band are honesty,
modesty, and humor. While many bands
posess the latter, the two former are
almost nonexistent in today’s music,

Even the finest pop~rock bands (db's,
Bongos, REM.) don‘t have that basic
sense of modesty Not that those bands
aren't first rate. 1 think they‘re great. But
they just don't have that extra something
Most bands are so wrapped up in image
that the true esence of the group’s music
becomes muddled. This simply isn't the
case with Violent Femmes.

Their music is pure. Yet this has little to
do with their lack of electronic gizmos, The
band's makeup (guitar, acoustic bass
guitar, and drums) is basic. It is that slms
ple and directexecution that makes things
work. They sing about teenage frustration
much the same way as Chuck Berry.

Comparisons to music of the 19505 are
clearly in order since stars from the
original rock 'n' roll era, like Chuck Berry,
Little Richard, Buddy Holly, and Carl
Perkins were able to communicate the

French Film

Series Begins

Two or the most gloriously in»
dividualistlc film-makers ot the mid-
century French cinema were Jean
Cocteau and Jacques Tati, who made films
on their own terms, not looking, as cnm~
mercial directors must, toward the au-
dience, out, rather, inviting spectators into
their own worlds. The next two films in the
French series, both Cocteau‘s Les Entants
Terribles and Tati's LeVacaiices De Mon-
sienr iiulot give viewers opportunity to
View their individualistic styles.

Based on the novel by Cocteau, Les En-
lants Terribles was released in 1950 and
found instant success, especially among
young viewers. The story is of a brother
and sister born into extreme wealth which
insulates them lrom the world to the extent
that they become vulnerable human bee
ings Their innocence leads them to
destruction when, as Cocteau puts it, "The
purity of the soul is pushed to the
extreme "

Francois Truliaut said of the film,
”When Les Enlallts Terribles was releas-

_ ed, it was unlike anything else being done

in French cinema. It brought to life on the
screen the profound, powerful, spellbirr
ding fascinaiton of the novel, which it llr
lustrated faithfully and in which the entire
generation of the Thirties recognized
themselves. It is an excellent idea to
release this film today when so many
young moviegoers feel a spiritual kinship
with the poetic cinema of youth."

Cocteau. interested not only in cinema
but in writing and other forms of the arts,

him For example, Jean Delannoy

ting artsy and pretentious. One might call
it naivete or innocence. I prefer to think of
it as honesty.

Violent Femmes are the first band since
the Modern Lovers or the Ramones who
are able to play with the honesty ot the
original rockers, Even the “punks" car
ried with them an arrogance which
dampened the spirit of the music. The
Clash are a perfect example: a band which
has become so caught up in themselves
and their “causes” that they now sound
really stupid.

Violent Femmes debut album on Slash
records is the most refreshing album in re-
Cent memory. Songs like “Kiss Off," "Add
it Up," “Prove My Love," and the
beautiful “Good Feeling" reveal a wonder-
ful sense of character that has become ab-
sent in most oi today's music, The band‘s
live shows are even better; three guys who
are having a good time and are happy. At a
time when being happy is so unlashionable
Violent Femmes are a slap in the face of
the dark day hands of today.

I don’t know if this band will ever
achieve a mass audience in America. Our
country may not be ready for this kind of
music, but for those who are, Violent Fem-
mes are indeed the band of the ‘30s
