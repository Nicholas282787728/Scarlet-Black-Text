Market research is “not a new thing" for
college admissions says Edward Barboni,
Sociology Professor and head oi Grinnell‘s
Office of Development and Planning, For
the past three years questionnaires have
been sent by the Admissions Oiice to three
distinct groups of students; high school
juniors and seniors who inquired of Grin-
nell but never applied, high school
graduates who were Offered admission to
Grinnell but never enrolled, and those
students who were offered admission and
decided to accept. The program attempts
to determine as accurately as possible stun
dents’ perceptions of Grinnell College, The
particulars of the research involved the
career aspirations and spec 1 interests of
prospectives. prospectives' primary
reasons for deciding where to apply and
where to enroll, and which other schools
they compared to Grinnell.

One of the disturbing things to come out
of the early findings, Barboni stated, is

that some high school seniors have 111307
curate perceptions of Grinnell. Many are
“gong to schools similar to Grinnell, but
not applying to Grinnell," and “as the pool
(of high school graduates) declines and if
we can get a larger percentage of them to
apply, the college has a chance of main-
taining its enrollment," said Barhoni.
Facing a 6 percent decline in high school
graduates last year, communicating effec~
tively is a must it the college hopes to
maintain present enrollment levels
without sacrificing academic standards.
Compared to last year, when 355 new
students arrived, this year's crop
“statistically shows a slight increase in
quality," said Admissions Counselor Ben~
net Barlett. Admission's office figures
have a 530/510 SAT average this year come
pared to a 580/600 last year. The average
high school class rank is up from a 72 per»
cent in the top quintile to a 75.6 percent
mark this year. Barlett cautioned that

— Abrams Drills Holes

by Ken Scatten

Changes to prevent record theft and
facilitate organization oi playlists were
implemented by KDIC staff members dur-
ing the past summer. Station manager
Alan Abrams had holes drilled in one thou-
sand of the station’s records to curtail
pilferage, an occurence that he termed
“KDIC’s most endemic problem.” The
modified records can only be played on
station turntables equipped with special
spindles since the center holes are too
large for conventional turntables. “It was
a radical step to take," said Abrams, “but
KDIC cannot fulfill its role as a forum for
alternative music when records are being
stolen all the time.” Theft in the past had
kept the station from buying additional
records. The new system has encouraged
the station to spend five hundred dollars in
an effort to bring its record library up to
date. ‘

Abrams also wrote a computer program
that allows disc-jockeys to enter informer
tion into terminals located at the station.
The program organizes this information
into playlists .that can be sent to record

companies,
native stations like KDIC do give airtime
to newly released records. Abrams hopes
that companies in turn will place mm on
their mailing lists for promotional
material.

In addtition to broadcasting recorded
music, the station has announced in intenr
tion to promote campus talent. This will
come in the form of ‘Outdoor Extrvaganr
zas.’ Campus musicians will perform on
the roof of Darby Gym before an audience
that is either watching from below or
listening to radios as KDIC \broadcasts
live. The first ‘Extavaganza’ is tentatively
scheduled for the afternoon of Saturday,
Sept. 17,

Major renovations in KDIC’s future in-
cude moving the station to the Forum,
boosting broadcasting power output from
to to 419 watts, and broadcasting in stereo.
However, these changes will not take place
until next summer at the earliest. The
delay is due to modifications that must be
made in the Forum to accommodate the
move, and the yet to be received notifica-

tion from the Federal Communications

Commission on its final approval for. the
power increase.

biartinek Threatens
To ‘tilin

by Eric Weiss

As the fall sports season begins, various
teams are now practicing and planning
strategies [or their opening games. During

the next couple or weekstlie. 5&Biwlll :

preview each of the fall tea‘ms,‘reporting
preparation and expectations for the comr
ing season.

"Emphasizetliepositive"

1n the past few years, the Grinnell root
ball team had a history of dissatisfied
players, controversey in the coaching
department and, yes, games lust. Coach
John Martinek didn't specify what these
problems were. “I just want to emphasize
the positive, Let‘s just say there were pro
blems,"

Coach Martinek's goal is to have the first
winning football team in 15 years, This
year's team has 27 returning players, Mars
tinek plans to move more of the experience
ed players to defense, under the assump
tion, of course, that if a team can’t score
they can’t win. The offense will consist of
more underclassmen sprinkled with
veterans.

For the lirst time in a few years, Grin-
nell does not have a freshman quarter-
back. Andy Hamilton, a junior and co
captain of the team, is currently a fron-
trunner far the Spot. Although he may
seem to be a fairly short quarterback at
510", Martinek explains, “We beat our
heads against the wall for years with the
drop back. This year we will do more
sprint—out passing and options."

The team also has a new motto — Do
your best and don’t sweat the rest. ”We
probably have not hada team motto in the
last 15 years either," said Martinek.

Pfitscll Piarms

Coach John Pfitsch is happy to report
that he has 13 returning soccer lettermen
this fall, “We have a full team to put on the
field, plus one extra."

The principle problem Pfitsch sees this

' coming season is the scoring forward line

or the “strikers”, as Pfitsch calls them.
“We’re lacking in both numbers and quali-
ty among the strikers... We hope the
freshmen will help us in this category.
Sometimes they [freshmen] have too
much pressure and sometimes they don't
produce, but i think they will reach their
potential,” said Pfitsch.

Piitsch also noted the strong schedule
they will play this fall, contending against

some of the toughest Division III teams in '

the country “People who know soccer

know McMurrey and Washington Lniver-
sittes are two great soccer powers of the
midwest," said Pfitsc'
The Competi \‘6 Edge

This year’s field hockey team has fewer
players than Coach Cathie Schweitzer ex-
pected. ”it would be nice if \ve could have
22 to 24 players. i expect we will have a few
more players out for the team once school
begins," said Schweitzer.

afternoon practice. Photo by Pat Smith,

What Schweitzer hopes to develop is a
more aggressive offense, which has been a
problem in the past, “We used to have a
non»aggressive attitude among the
players, but there has been a change... A
lot of the freshmen are not out just for fun
but to improve their ability and
themselves, When individuals improve
then the team improves. which in turn
leads to a certain degree of com-
petitiveness; it gives us a competitive
edge,” Said Schweitzer.

Schweitzer sadly noted that field hockey,
while it is a big sprot on the east coast, is a
dying sport in the midwest. “The only'
teams we play in our conference are Lake
Forest and the University of Chicago, It's
getting tougher and tougher to schedule
every year," - ' ' '
