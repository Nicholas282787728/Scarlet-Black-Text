SiSKEL and EBERT

by Jim and Billy

After we sriw Body iloat this past
weekend. we had varying opinions. we
both ielt it was an extremely brilliant iilm
which was marred only by poor editing
Did all oi you notice that nasty little
microphone in so many scenes? We sup-
pose the entire crew was too busy wiping
the perspiration on their iaces to notice all
the technical problems with this film.
Overall, though. we went thumbs up. 1f0n'
ly tor the cute remarks the two cons
spirators had ior each other,

Missing, the first of the CostarGavras
series. akes us to Chile, 1973 A military
coup is trying to prevent Allende‘s election
and Charles Hoffman tJohn Sheai, a
young American journalist. disappears.
His father Ed, a Christian Scientist
businessman lJack Lemmon), and his
wife tSlssy Spaceki team up and try to iind
out it he is missing or dead. The film is
Costa»Gavras' indictment of the US. and
raises some vital questions about the pracr
tices oi the (Nixonianl US. government.

Although Lemmon was nominated ior an
academy award for his periorrnance, he
seems to be suriering trom the trap oi a
comedian playing a serious role. The film
does have a great deal of significance. but
the point could probably be stated just as
well in a twenty minute documentary,
rather than the two hours it endures. It
drags and we'd rather see Lemmon play
ing Felix Unger ~ thumbs down.

This weekend we again get to play spot
the iat man. ror Alired Hitchcock's To
(’atcli it Ttiiri is showing, This film, starrr
ing Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, is abouta
iamous cat burglar who retires to the
Riviera and catches a thiei who is ime
itating his style Aslhetically, this iilm is
thumbs up since we have Cary Grant.
Grace Kelly and beautiiul sccneiy.

The age old laughter. When Comedy “'2“
King. is also showing. licomedy was king,
what is king now? 7 and who is queen" We
suppose it is probably violence and sex.
eh”

by Alphie Knox

A trend in popular music oi the eighties
has been to look backward rather than fora
ward tor inspiration Many groups are
remaking old songs. The most popular ex:
ample is Taco‘s “Puttin' on the Ritz", a
song from an old Fred Astaire moVie,
others merely copy old sounds, The least
original are the Stray Cats. who imitate
the iiities rockabilly sound

Somewhere In between lies the British
group, Roman Holllday, who are neither
widely known in America nor too
unoriginal. The seven member group
lakes elements from the thirties and tour-
ties big band era The brass section and
harmonizing vocals. combined with
modern instruments and lyrics. produce a
very catchv sound. Added to this is that
youthful spunk comition to other young.
all-male groups tsuch as Madness. The
Specials. Haircut One Hundi'edi,

Their iirst song, “Stand By", is a minor
MTV hit. It tells of a young man scared of a
woman who is pursuing him. Their "new"
song “Don‘t Try to stop It" is now receiv-
ing some airplay Though their music is
iar trom periect, especially ior those who
want musxc with meaning, Roman Hollis
day is a {un group with a bouncy beat and
uncomplicated lyrics, Stand By is
guaranteed to put the listener in a good
mood

 

 

Costa - Gavras Films
Z at Grinnell

The films of Constantine Gavras, known
proicssionally as CostarGavras, carry a
highly personal signature, with only one or
two exceptions, they are controversial.
hardshitting and strikingly political. The
group of four presented on the October
calendar are irom the mainstream and,
with the exception of Missing, are part at
the French language series. viewers will
he struck by their many parallels to each
other and. to some degree, to directors
such as Hitchcock, Rene Clement and
Polanski

7. IS probably the best known and most
universally praiscd oi all Costa-Gavras
iilms The story deals with an inquiry into
the death or a Greek pactiist parliament
member struck down by a speeding truck,
and the enormous web or government
scandal disclosed by the investigation
Many viewers list 1 among the best iilms
they have seen Among the film‘s awards
are Best Picture of 1970, the Academy
Award. New York Film Critics Award and
National Catholic Olflce and National
Council of Churches First Jomt Award.
Pauline Kael in The Nev» Yorker said, 2
damn near knocks you out of your seat.
Saturday, 9 45 p m.. ARH. Monday. we
p m ,ARH 128 minutes.

Missing is Costa»Gavras’ most commer-
cially successful as well as one of his most
controversial films. its plot is generally
known; not so readily recognized however,
is the iact that it is in many wayssimilar to
State uf Siege and z in plot and pacing.
Based on an actual incident. the story does
not deviate from the Horman book. It sets
forth the details of a search for a missing
man impeded by lies. evasions, coverrups
and diversions into Circles and blind
alleys. Jack Lemmon and Sissy Spacek
play the father and wite oi the missing
man. Friday. 9.30 pm. ARH. Sunday.
8.30 p in . ARI-I, 110 minutes

Special Section is relatively obscure
Costa»Gavras Set in Paris, it too is
politically oriented, although in a diiierent
context. It revolves around World War II
activities of the French Vichy Govern
ment, the Nazi occupation iorces, and the
French underground movement. viewers
will find it interesting to note both com-
parisons and contrasts with the other
films. Made in 1975 after Z and State of
siege. Special Section displays Costa-
Gavras‘ skills in the creation of suspense:
filled political drama. Wednesday, 8:30
pm, ARH. Thursday, 9:30 pm, South
Lounge. 111 minutes.

, state of siege is the tense story of a
political kidnapping based on the actual
kidnapping of a U.S. official a few years
ago. Piece by piece, revolutionaries un»
cover the discreetly concealed function of
the "Special Adviser" in their country,
and the director‘s portrait of the U.S. role
in Latin America takes shape. This is
another of Costa-Gavras' controversial
works, containing similar themS to those
set forth earlier in land, later, in Mi ing.
It is interesting to note that Custa~Gavras
chose Yves Montand as his leading
character both for Z and for State of Siege.

The New York Post praised the
director's use or suspense and excitement
and rated the film as one of “inﬁtimable
value." The New York Times said, ”A
knock-out oi a movie, a superb, enthrall-
ing, unforgettable film.” Saturday, Oct. 8,
10:15 p.m., ARH. Sunday, Oct. 9, a pm,
ARH. 120 minutes.
