The thirty-four member men's
squad will run all three oi its pres
conierence meets at home starting
with today's and then on February
15th and 22nd. Today's meet against
Simpson and Central ls not a cone
ference meet, but is still considered to
be very important by Fankey, who
sees it as a way or judging his squad's
performance.

Coach Mary Ann Pankey's squad,
which is ﬁelding 27 lracksters this
year, will be driving towards a strong
finish in their own Grinnell Women‘s
Invitational meet on March 8th. Ex-
pecting about it teams to enter the
event, the soft spoken Pankey said she
felt her Squad could better its 3rd
place finish of last year.

Citing the strength of her returning
runners and the good performances of
her newcomers in practice, Pankey
said that “we have a better allrai'ound
team this year than we had last
year " But she still predicts that
either Luther or Dordl will capture Lh
top spot at the Invitational meet.

The women follow the same
schedule as the men up to the last
meet, when they will warm up for the
Invitational by meeting conference
rival University or Chicago in a dual
meet, there, on February 29th
