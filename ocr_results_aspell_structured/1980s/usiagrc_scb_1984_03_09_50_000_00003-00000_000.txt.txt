“The progress of our training

just right." said men's coach Will
Freeman. “All of the men and

well."

One outstanding performer for
the men was senior Jon Maron,

Luck is not a lady

by Robert Quashie

Luck was not on the side of the
Women's soccer club as neither
squad advanced to the final round
of double elimination play in the
first Grinnell Invitational
Women's Indoor Soccer Tourna-
ment.

Both the Scarlet and the white
squads sutfered losses in die first
round of play and because of the
bracketing system, they had to
face each other in the second
round which the White squad won
1-0. Grinnell went on to tace
Luther, who eventually went on to
tinish in second place out of a field
of seven teams.

Taking the trophy and finishing
above Luther was Greater Des
Moines Select. UNI came in third,
Drake finished fourth, This was
the last tourney of Grinnell’s in
door season.

The outdoor season will begin
April seventh and the third annual
Grinnell Outdoor Invitational-will
be held April fourteenth on Mac
Field. The season ender will be
May fifth.

The club is part of the Central
lowa Women's Soccer League
which includes many of the small
colleges in the area, private club
teams such as “The Tall” and
Drake University “Pile Drivers

The club, which goes (among
others) by the nickname
‘Bedlahm’, was formed by Laura
Sinai ('83) and others who had the
interest.

In the first few years, the team
played one or two games per
season and struggled to fill a
roster, but today, they not only
host two tournaments but boast a
roster larger than mat of the Var-
sity Football squad.

Sheryl Thedford will represent
Grinnell College at the NCAA
Division 111 national swimming
and diving championships Thurs-
day through Saturday. March
8-10.

The meet will be held at Emery
