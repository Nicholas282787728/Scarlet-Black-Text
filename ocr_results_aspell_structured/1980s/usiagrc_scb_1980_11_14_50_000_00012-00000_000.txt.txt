The ﬁve year plan

We are faced with the closing of the
Health Center. Last Friday’s 5&8 arti-
cle (”Health Center to close?”) laid
out an impressive list of arguments in
favor of this closing. As usual, the ad-
ministration has presented the student
body with a near fait aecompli. When
Dean Tederman “favors the proposal
since students would probably receive
‘more comprehensive services for
fewer dollars,‘ " he raises the specter of
economic necessity. This liscal em~
phasis tends to overpower other. more
important arguments.

Hospital. Students who oppose this plan

effective protest.

‘ The perception oi the Health Center
staff as mere aspirin dispensers does

fers a number of currently unavailable
services, but neglects to mention how
the old ones will be replaced. The per
sonal touch oi the Health Center Will not
be found in a hospital which Tederman
hinisell notes "has not alvi ays been sen
sitive to students in the past.“
