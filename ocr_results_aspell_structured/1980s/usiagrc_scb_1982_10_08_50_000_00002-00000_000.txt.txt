was concerned about classes beginning too
early in August and running too late into
December. Once the committee

Committee undecided on
.SGA reserve surplus,

by Barb Little

haye iiny ideas on how to spend on
unexpected 37,0007 The Finance t'om
mitieehas so much money it doesn'l know
what to do with it.

:tecause or an accounting error last
year. there is now a reserve in this year's
budget of $12,000. As is customary. 5.000
of the reserve is set aside to accommodate
any unforeseen difficulties Such as the
loss of $600 that SGA encountered in
organizing shuttles a couple of years ago
This amount is supplemented by ﬁle col-
lege endowment if necessary. Despite this
use, there is still an excess of 57,000.

Vern Juel, head of the Finance ('om
mittee. outlined the various ideas that the
committee has considered thus far. One
suggestion was that the money be put into
a capital improvements fund. This fund
would be a long time investment that
would benefit many classes of students

Rabchuk and Brown then interviewed
Dean Frazer to research the procedure by
which students might propose an extension
of the buffer days. Frazer was careful to
point In the Calendar i'omiitittet-s'
exhaustive efforts to produce a schedule
amenable to the faculty and the ad
ministration which avoided any reduction
of the break periods. The Dean stressed
that the dates for the next (WU years were
“fixed", explaining the “pragmatic dif-
ficulties" in any changes at this point,
which would include reprinting Ihe
colleges' promotional literature

Frazer explained that any proposals
would have to go before the (‘ommittee on
Academic Standing for approval and then
to the faculty for a vote. Such a petition.
l-‘razer cautioned. should systematically
respond to the faculty's stipulations.
October l5 is the deadline for any
proposals.

Brown and Rabchuck are initially
pressing for an extra day in the buffer
period. An extra buffer day would require
an additional class day in another part of
the semester. Their short term plan in
cludes an effort to inform the students of
thecurrent Situation and the requirements
for an amendment.

suggested that the money be given to [he
radio station to purchase albums which
have been misplaced or damaged over the
years, He also proposed that all KDlt‘
albums be speciially drilled between a 33
rpm and 45 rpm record, so that only the
radio station would have the llC'
commodating facilities for such albums
implementation of such a proposal would
help reduce record theft

Another proposition was that the money
be contributed toward fixing the ARH
sound system. a plan which would be
financed by the capital improvements
fund. Besides this major ' area of in
vestment, there is the possibility that the
money will be used to enrich already
existing events. Skip Day is one event
which could be financed with the excess
funds. The surplus could also be “blown
off” in one night for an all-campus party.

Juel suggested that ihe committee
favored a combination of these proposals.
claiming that, due to the diverse interests

New rules may

hinder fall
GORP trip

by Leah Reynolds

The destination ls unknown. but (trinnell
Outdoor Recreation Program will sponsor
a trip this fall break. Due to new
regulations imposed by the tide
ministration, the only [all break excursion
is still in the initial planning stages.

The college now requires supervision til
students en route to and from Iheir
destination. Supervisors must be college
faculty or staff members such as
professors or resident advisers. Also, the
cost of transportation for trips in college-
nwned vehicles has doubled from 15 cents
to 30 cents per mile.

According to Katherine Mct‘luskey.
GORP adviser. these regulations could
affect the feasibility of the fall break Irip
The requirement for a supervisor means
that the variety oi possible destinations is
limited to places that a su rvisor is
available to travel. Another di iculty is
iinding a laciilty member who is willing to
donate his or her tail break to the [rip since
many professors have already made plans
for the break.

The GORP trips nre designed to m
troduce students in outdoor recreation."
McCluskey explained. The proyam is
open to anyone who is interested. “not just
the hardcore com» people." she added.
The GORP ff selects these students
through applications. People of all levels
of ability are taught an outdoor skill such
as backpacking, canoeing or bicycling that
“they will be able to do all their lives."
McCluskey said. These trips tire also
exercises in leadership for Students who
are interested in becoming GORP leaders

McCluskey agrees with the lid
ministrations' concern for ensuring safety.
but she feels that the GORP leaders have
sufficient training and onrcampus support
to handle emergencies. She does believe
that a GORP trip would be it wonderful
way for students and professors to gel to
know each other outside the classroom
situation.

McCluskey hopes lhal the new
regulations and higher cost will not cause
a decline in applications for the program's
trip. She feels that the trip would provide a
valuable learning eweriaice for anyone
who has never been in the wilderness as
well as a very enjoyable way to spend fall
break.

A location for the trip is undecided
Possibilities include a canoeing journey in
die Ozark Mountains. Usually the fall trip
is planned five or six weeks in advance.
but because of the administration's
examination of the program this year.
there are only two weeks in which to
organize the outing Supervisors are still
needed for the fall trip.

Trial run for temporary force

by Karyn Reif

There were some "official" laces at
college parties last weekend; for the first
time security guards were present' at
parties other than the all»campus events
held in Darby. The policy, which went into
effect this semester. is designed to protect
the college as well as those people spans
soring the party from legal problems.
Dean of Student Affairs Jim Tederman.
Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Bob
ToWnereLarsen and Joint Board agreed to
the hiring procedlue of the permanent
security guards, who will be paid from a
fund designated by Joint Board. Applir
cations were accepted during a two week
period. On Joint Board's request. Vice
President Mark Bradshaw and Social
Coordinator Allison Paich Will interview
the 11712 students who applied, Because all
applications were not in until last Friday.
interviews for a permanent staff will not
be until early next week. This official
security force will be in operation by the
end of this month.

Since the parties last weekend were the
only ones to be held before the establish-
ment of the new security force, Tederman
and Townerdaarsen requested that the
groups holding each party hire their own

» guards. Four people were hired by KDIC

to work at Friday's event in Gardner
Lounge. Peter Kupferberg. KDIC program
director and security guard at the party.
was given instructions to have someone
check le at the door. have someone
watching the dance floor and have others
walking around. Basically the guards were
told to keep ﬁteir eyes open for potential
problems.

German House did not have security
guards for their Oktoberfest party.
although there was someone designated to
check ms before people were allowed to
drink beer. The lack of an official security
force prevented German House from
having any outer security guards,

No incidents were reported at either
party. However. there seemed to be
consensus that some sort of security is
needed. Brian Pamen. another guard at
the KDIC party. thought that when a great
deal of alcohol flows, there is a need for
security. Kupferberg said that ”it's
necessary to have security guards in case
anything happens," although he did not
think that SGA should be spending money
for the guards He felt that there are
“enough people justwilling to see. a party
pulled off well.”
