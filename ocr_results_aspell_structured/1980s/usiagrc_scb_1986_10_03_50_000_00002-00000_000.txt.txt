Pakistani

By Bruce J. Emond

Since its formation in 1947, Pakistan has
had an often tumultuous and bloody
history. Bordered almost entirely to the
west by lndia, the ideological diiferences
between this fervently Islamic nation and
its larger pro-Soviet neighbor continue to
foster tensions

Western attention focused on Pakistan in
1971 when, after a bitter Civil war, the
eastern portion of Pakistan seceded and
became Bangladesh. In the late 19705,
Pakistan was the scene of turmoil once
again as longetime Pakistan leader

:Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was overthrown in a
military coup and subsequently hanged for
the alleged murder of a political opponenl,’
Bhutto's successor. General Mohammad
Zia Al~Haq has guided Pakistan along in
creasingly restrictive, Islamic-based dic-
tums,

ln January of this year, Zia lifted the
nineryearrold martial law, and in the wake
of this. Bhutto's daughter Beiiazir returne

and call for elections. The last few, months

Pakistani students attending Grinnell.
Camilla Rab, Reena Jooma. and Dina
Shah, (a fourth student decllnded the Sand
B's request for an interview because she
said she had been away too long to be able
to evaluate the situation). shared their
views on Pakistan's political and social
troubles. They concurred on the poverty
and corruption which plague Pakistan’s el-
iorts at development but differed radlcally
in their predictions for its future,

All three students depicted Pakistan as a
nation where fundamentalist Islamic docV
trine has greatly affected government and
society since Zia's ascension to power. Zia
employs the term “lslamization” to
describe the sweeping laws and reforms
which have banned alcohol, closed “decae
dent" bars and restaurants, and curtailed
co-education to all but a few private
schools.

‘Now if there is a picture

of a Western actress,

cleavage

Under Bhutto, Rab said the Islamic in-
fluence was there but there was a respect
for individual rights. “When Bhutto was in
power, people could make a choice bet-
ween drinking, dressing in Western
clothes. even eating pork. or being an or-
thodox Muslim.“

Rab said that today, Pakistan resembles
Saudi Arabia. “If you‘re caught with
alcohol, the penalty is public floggings and
many traditional Islamic laws are coming
back," she said.

The students noted that the masculine
bias of Islam and Islamization has had a
detrimental effect on the status 0! women

Students’ Reactions ,

in Pakistan. City women risk being de-
nounced as immoral if they do not wear the
traditional head covering and cover their
bodies almost entirely. Students cited the
enacting of a controversial new law where
two women witnesses are now required to
be of the same worth as one male witness.
In practice, this means that a woman who
has been raped needs another woman as
Witness before she can file a complaint.

Rab described one case where a sixteen
year old blind servant girl was raped by
her wealthy employer The girls' lather
tried to save her honor by taking the case
to court. Adhering to the new Islamic laws,
the court deemed the girl an adulteress
and the man was acquitted.

Zia has effectively gained control of or
removed all public forums for voicing
grievances against his government,
Papers and television are rigidly over-
seen; the anonymous student said that all
mention of Bhutto was prohibited until the
last few months. Movies and books are
also censored, as are newspaper and
magazine photos lrom the wire services

“If there is a picture ofa Western ac-
tress like Ellzabeth’ Taylor wearing a
revealing dress, the censors draw in over
her cleavage to give her a higher
neckline,” Shah said,

All agreed. however. that a black

modities declared off-limits by Zia's
government. Corruption is rife in
bureaucracy The students mentioned that
“knowing the right people,“ can get one
passports and other documents without
ever having to perform any ol lhe
prescribed regulations

“My mother can’t drive Very well but
she got her license anyway without having
to take the test," confided one of the
students.

The military, instrumental in 213's com-
ing to power, has garnered lucrative in
dustrial contracts and wields huge power
in the Pakistani government. Rab said

‘that amongst the army, corruption is par
ticularly pervasive and the army hierar-
chy live by extravagant standards
unknown to the average Pakistani.

Dina shah was the only one among the
three who believes that Benazir Bhutto
will eventually attain the presidency. “The
people are behind her and ii they force an
election. Zia could only win by fixing the
ballot boxes,"

She labeled the supposedly free elections
of 1935 “farcical" and said most of what
Zia says is “rubbish."

“In the 1985 election there were no
political parties on the ballot. just this
question ‘Do you want the lslamic state in
Pakistan or not’l' " The student said Zia
boasted a 97% turnout at the polls and a
universal response in his favor.

“Benazir Bhutto hasn't really Said much
yet but the people support her because
the ‘re dying for a chanee." Shah said.

attributed the economic upswing
since Zia took office to tortuniiy.
“Pakistan had bumper crops and

everybody said it was because of the new
government when it was just luck, And. or
course, the rich like Zia because Bhutto
nationalized private mills and oil holdings,
and zia is giving them those back.”

She criticized zia's Islamization policies
ior creating a repressed socily where rela-
tioiiships behveen mcll and womcn are abr

”NOW Dareilts don't Want to send-their
children to cured schools because they’re
scared they'll be corrupted or something."

’Thefact that Bemzzir is a

woman makes it
impossible that Muslim

Pakistan will ever
elect her’

Reena Jooma gave a vastly divergenl
view of the Zia government. Although con-
ceding that it has weakened women's
rights, she praised the Zla's lslamization
program for promoting brotherhood and
nationalism among the Pakistani people,
Ill her opinion, Pakistan is better off under
Zia than during the old Bhutto regime. She
said Zia's implementation of the Zakal.
which takes a percentage of all savings
and employs them in agricultural and
education programs, has helped the
average Pakistani.

"Bhutto made all the mistakes. He built
casinos and bars which Pakistan didn't
need And Bhutto was the one who made
bribery and corruption part of Pakistan
liie," Jooma said,

Jooma was equally critical of Bhutto's
daughter “Benazir is givmg false hopes to
the poor, She says a lot of things which
she'll never be able to carry out,”

Jooma said that Benazir's predominant-
ly western background (both Jooma and
Rab commented on her mediocre Urdu,
Pakistan's national language) render her
an unsuitable candidate for tradition-
based Pakistan. and she scoffed at
Benazir’s professed devotion to Islam.

"Benazir is now trying to use Islam to ‘

win votes. She says she goes .on
pilgrimages and that she's religious. She
thinks that by putting on a head covering,-
she suddenly becomes devout," she said.
Dismissing speculation that Bhutto
could become president in the near future,

Jooma said, “For one thing, Zia has the-

military backing and they won't change
for Benazir. And the fact that Benazir is a
woman makes it impossible that Muslim
Pakistanis will ever elect her."

Rab deplored Zia's repression of per-
sonal freedoms but she too does not foresee

ship. “The economy is stable and people
aren‘t discontented yet, so why would they
want another change? "

She said that Zia‘s strong, pro»American

concert, according to Rowat. One of the
songs on the record, “The Family," was
chosen specifically because it had been “a
big hit," Rowat said, in the 1935 benefit
concert

A packet of information and records was
sent to each radio station in Des Moines. It
was hoped that the resulting airplay would
generate sales, but apart from one or two
stations, the record was ignored.

Rowat blames the failure of the records
sales on the radio stations’ lack of
"Cooperation."

“[The record] should've been a big deal,
one of the biggest things to happen to the
Des Moines area,” Rowat said. ”We really
did well in getting people behind [the
lowald record] until we got to the radio
stations."

Triad Studios in Des Moines donated
their facilities for recording the two songs;
the musicians donated their time and
talent; and “essentially all the record
stores" in Des Moines agreed to donate
every cent received from sales of the
record. Rowat observed.

However, Ford in retrospect admitted
that depending solely on the radio stations
to promote the record was not the best 01
marketing plans. “I suppose that was

too much of a dream.”she said.

Furthermore. when a local cablerTV star
lion decided nor to cover the second cone
cert as originally planned, “We weren't
really prepared to compensate for adverv
tising and publicity," Rowal said.

Others have pointed to this lack of a solid
marketing plan as the maln problem.

Terry King. cellist lor Grinnell College's
world»reno\vned Mirecourt Trio and para
liClpant in the record, remarked, “The
heart was all in the right place but there
wasn't somebody who put their heart
behind the understanding-marketing end
of it, That was the only problem because
the rest of it [the record] is good and
should have been a usable product."

It has also been pointed out that while it
might have sounded like a good idea to use
as much at Iowa's musihal as possible,
more does not necessarily always result in
the most aesthetically-pleasing result.

For example, King was asked by Triad
Studios producer Rick Condon to write the
string music as well as perform. However.
by the time all the other tracks were addr
ed. the strings were “somewhat buried.”
Klng said. .

King was excited about the project
because he feels strongly about the iamily~
farm crisis. His grandmother was a native
of Grinnell and “her parents were a farm-
ing family," he said,

He also was enthused about the musical
opportunity.

“I've written a lot of arrangements, . .
but i've never actually invented some
,music. actually composed something when
there wasn't anything there.

”The producer said everybody was
wiped out by the strings," he said. But due
to the number of musicians and styles in
the record, “They had to put it underneath
things because it went-in a slightly diie
ferent direction." he explained. "Of
course. I didn‘t know in what direction
they were going. . '

The appropriateness of the song and
music has also been questioned.

“Most farmers like country and this is
kind of bluesy,” one record~store owner
sald. ‘

However, the organizers have still not
given up on the potential of the Iowaid
record.

Ford said they are working on develop
ing a marketing tool since therecord “is so
good!"

King also stressed that his remarks were
“by no way an apology.” He teels there is
still a market for the record and that “peo-
ple should buy the record just to support
the Venture."

The Iowaid record can be purchased for
$2.00 at the Music Shop on Broad Street in
Grinnell. All proceeds will be donated to
the Food Bank of Central Iowa and the
Farm Crisis Hotline.

Both organizations have provided aid to
the needy in Poweshiek County. according

 

to their respective directors.
