Blood drive features dorm

by Mike Aiexander

I remember the first time I gave
blood. It was in the 11th grade. Well, I
hadn't eaten before the smiling nurse
stuck that needle in my arm and remov-
ed a pint of my bodily fluid and I paid
for my mistake, I threw up.

There is going to be a blood drive
right here on campus, starting this
Wednesday. That's right, irom April is
to 17 all students, faculty members and
administrators are encouraged to come
over to the Forum‘s North Lounge and
donate an expendable pint oi blood.
Just don’t iorget to eat something
before you do!

The Student Coordinator's Office of
SGA has been sponsoring a blood drive
at Grinnell every semester ior the past
three years. Originally, the Blood
Center was only on campus for one day
but support for the drive has been so en-
thusiastic that the office increased its
recruitment eiiorts to a three-day
period. Last semester, 341 people
donated, which exceeded the goal of
325. This semester the number of cons-
cientious donors is hoped to be even
higher. At present, Grinnell has the
highest rate of participation oi all
so outs in Iowa, Do your part to keep
Grinnell number one!

Student Coordinator Teri Gould
worries that the turnout may be
somewhat disappointing compared to
that of last semester, “Usually the
blood people are here right at the begin»
ning of the semester,” she said,
“Things didn‘t work out that way this
time so a lot of people might say they
have too much work to do. They won’t
be able to give up the time to come over
and donate."

Actually, considering that the whole
process of giving blood (including fill-
ing out the forms) takes up less than
one hour's worth of time, that excuse is
worthless, Most people waste more
time every morning just trying to con-
