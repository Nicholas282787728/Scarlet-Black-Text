Volleyball spikes way back onto
court after three-year absence

by Bmce Nissen

Following a throe»year period
of dormancy, Grinnell is once
again fielding a USVBA
volleyball team. The team
traveled to Drake last Saturday to
compete in its ﬁrst tournament.

Braving the sub-zero weather,
the sclf»named “Grinnell
Experience" expected the Drake
trip to be a learning experience
but ended the trip with a 375
record and a high degree of respect
from many of its opponents.

Grinnell opened with a pair of
losses to Iowa State. This
accomplished two things for the
Experience: it got rid of their

firstvloumament jitters and proved
to the team that it should try to
avoid 9 am. tnatches.

Rebounding off this defeat,
Grinnell swept the small but
scrappy Maharishi International
University team. After falling to
Graceland, the team played its
best matches of the day against
the host team.

Although falling behind early
in the first game, several key
spikes by the Experience’s only
senior. Brian Flood, brought the
team to game point. Shortly
thereafter, Grinnell sealed the 12-
10 victory off a spike by

sophomore Jason Gunnink.
Drake, however, won the second
game of the match 11-7.

Overall, the young squad
lacked the smoothness and
confidence of the other, more
experienced, teams. Grinnell
managed to hang close thanks to
both a solid defense and periodic
spurts of timely offensive
prowess.

Sunday the team travels to
Oskaloosa for a four-team
tournament, returning home on
Feb. 18 to host an invitational
meet.

the first half ended with LC.
holding a slim 35-34 lead.
Grinnell ended the half
shooting an excellent 47 percent
from the floor while the visitors
managed to hold on with 43»

percent shooting. In the second
half, both teams struggled to
maintain a lead. It was not until
LC. forward Valerie Lcitchuh
demonstrated that she did indeed
have ice in her veins that the
game was decided. Lcitehuh
proved unstoppable in the final
minutes as she poured in 10 of
her team-high 25 points to lead
the visitors to a 75-69 victory.
Laura VanSiekle paced Grinnell
with 25 points and seven boards
while Jen Wood added 14 points.
On Tuesday night the women
packed up and headed to Cedar
Rapids to face Coe. Yet again,
. the home team was ready to play;
only this time, the visitors
weren‘t. The Lady Kohawks

stormed out of the locker room
and, before the Pioneers could
yell, “What the hell is a
K0hawk7" they had jumped out
to a 27-2 lead. The Pioneer cause
was further hindered by 28 first-
half turnovers and an acute
inability to find their range,
mustcring only 34—percent
shooting from the ﬂoor.

Coo never gave the Pioneers a
chance to breathe as they coasted
to a 77-43 victory behind Michel

three assists. VanSiekle was the

with 13.

That the Pioneers have the
capability to overcome this streak
of losses is not in doubt. They
have demonstrated their talent
over and over again and it is now

a matter of getting back in sync.
Tomorrow afternoon Grinnell
hopes to chalk another mark up
on the “W” side, as they host
Monmouth at 2 pm. in the
friendly confines of Darby Gym-

I could see Dad through the wind

his shoulders shaking. I brushed

And told him in a strained voice,
“Dad, I lost the cones.” He reached

“Here. Go get two more." He

Swimmers
quite well,

perform
but come

up just shy . . .

by Gordon Sehreiber

The Grinnell women’s swim
team traveled to Northeast
Missouri State for a dual meet on
Friday night. but came up short
in their bid for an upscl, 1227
107.

Despite losing the meet,
Grinnell did receive some
outstanding individual
performaees. The 400 medley
relay of Koa, Peterson, Lange and
Oggel took a first place finish as
did Katy Furnish in the so free
with a time of 25.56. Other top
performances were turned in by
Deb Koa, who won the 200
breaststroke and Heather Lauver,
who swept the 1 meter and 3
meter diving events. In the 1000
freestyle, Alyson .lepsen dropped
approximately 20 seconds of f her
previous time.

Head coach Sheila Cain used
the meet as learning experience

for the upcoming conference
meet. Cain swam several people
in back-to-back events in order to
see how they would perform
under the same situation at
conference.

With only two meets
remaining before a showdown at
conference, this was the last
chance for conference tune-ups.
and seeing who might be able to
swim in certain events. Cain is
also looking forward to getting
Shannon Swanstrom back into
the line-up this weekend. She
has been out of action with a
shoulderyinjury.

Tomorrow the team travels to
Coe to swim in the State Meet.
At stake is the state
championship between the
smaller schools. Cain feels that
with a good effort, the women
should win the meet.

drown another victim

by Laura Whitmore

The men's swim Learn had an
exciting weekend meet at
Northeast Missouri State. OK,
so it was actually not that
exciting. OK, so Grinnell could
have outswam NEMO with their
hands tied behind their backs.
NEMO tried but they were no
match for the Pioneers who won
the mee1155‘78.

Phil Bishop once again won
both the diving events, but since
NEMO didn't send the diving
results to Grinnell, I can't tell
you how our other divers did.

Junior Peyton Engel won the
1000m. Engel claims he enjoys
swimming the distance events.
Proof of a sick mind, I say. Joe
Zimscn in the 200 free and John
Williams in the 50 were also
victorious. Steve Clctn capturcd
the IM and the backstroke. Scott

Potts outdistaneed the
competition to win the 100 free.
And Dave Ressner swam the
200M butterﬂy in 2:00.43, just
threerhundredths of a second off
the school record. Notice how
many ways I used in this
paragraph to say we won.

This weekend the Pioneers
travel to Coe (yes, again) for the
state championships. They'll
swim against Luther, Loras,
Buena Vista, Cornell, and Coe.
The Pioneers have won this meet
every year since it was started and
Coach Obermiller expects this
year to be no different, saying,
“This is the beSt team I‘ve
coached at Grinnell going into
this meet." Considering past
Grinnell teams, that is quite a
compliment.
