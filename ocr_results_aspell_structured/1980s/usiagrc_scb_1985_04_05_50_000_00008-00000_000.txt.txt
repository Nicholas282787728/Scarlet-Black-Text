"“8 Opinion and Editorial

Maybe Ethan Cohen was right when he said
in his campaign speeches that things at this
school are stifled by too much bureaucracy
and that if the students really want buffer
days then they should just stop going to
classes the last Wednesday of the semester.
Working through the system doesn’t seem to
pay off. This week the faculty decided that it
would not be worth the time to form a special
committee to study the calendar so that it
might make real suggestions on how to reduce
academic stress and to improve the educa-
tional experience of the students of Grinnell.

More than saying no to the committee, the
faculty said no to the idea of buffer days as a
valid concern. They don‘t need them.
They have the summer free to study,
research, or to even be paid to attend
seminars,

The faculty is happy, we guess. Never mind
that 86 percent of the students polled was in

favor of buffer days.

The Faculty gets that added day or two to
work on research and creative materials
(Something, we guess, they couldn’t do during
buffer days). Never mind the students who
could use a day or two to finish a term paper or
the students who may have two exams on the
first day of the exam week.

And it would be a sin that any professor
should have to teach a Tuesday class on a
Wednesday. Never mind that there were at
least two suicide attempts during the last
week of the first semester this year.

The Faculty will still get paid by Grinnell to
produce. The students will still pay the bucks
for Grinnell.

Who cares anyway? The students here
would never do anything nearly as radical as
to boycott classes. Most are either too selfish,
don’t have the time, or feel they are under too
much pressure to get good marks,

‘Grounds for thought"

In October, 1933, l was among a group
of Grinnell students who staged a small
protest at Offutt Air Force Base in
Omaha. Nebraska. Offutt is a Strategic
Air Command tSAC) base, which
means that a lot of sophisticated
military planning goes on there. It
wasn't a grand dramatic protest. just a
bunch of college kids marching past the

, Sign which said “Peace is our profes
sion”, continuing to walk past where
the general public is allowed to where a
line of guards blocked our way, sitting
down and singing as they told us to
leave. not leaving -end being hauled
avlay and fingerprinted.

it was a simple. tidy matter, not even

very scary. I fell. myself shaking with
anger instead. “What kind of a crazy
world is this7”, was probably foremost
in my naive little thoughts, “Why am i
breaking the law by sitting on a pave-
ment in Omaha. Nebraska? How can

those perlectly normallooking guys be
investing the best years of their lives in

They kept us around tor a long while.
Not that they were so delighted to have
our cheery faces around, but maybe it
was because they wanted to impress us
\\ ith the illegality of our action. There
were mug shots and fingerprints to be
taken, questions to be asked, warning
leltei's to be handed out. We were frisk-
ed by officers of our mm gender,

The guards didn't have much to do,
and lie|ther did we. Smokers‘chain-

around about nothing in particular and
laughed high. nervous little laughs, We
tried to talk to the guards. One man was
from Iowa. so We lalked about that. We
discussed fishing. and foreign countries
he was interested in ViSIting. He was
young — 21 or 22 , and seemed proud of
being a guard for the Air Force. though
he gave no patriotic reasons ltwas just
