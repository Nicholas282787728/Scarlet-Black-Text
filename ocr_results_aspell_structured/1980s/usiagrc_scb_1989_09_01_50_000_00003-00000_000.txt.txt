‘What are you doing here?’

“It is strange.
Like the ﬁrst timeI
walked across
campus, it was
freaking my mind,
because I kept
thinking, Iwasjust
here a few months
ago, what am I
doing here again?
When I left Grinr
nell. after gradu—
ation I said, ‘Oh.
I‘m goingtogetmy
littlediploma in my
hot little hand and
that’s it.’

“I’m originally
from Davenport.
Iowa, and I said,
‘That’s it, I'm getting out of Iowa,
I‘m gelling out of Grinnell‘...and I
never in my wildest dreams thought
I’d beback in Grinnell working here.

“I knew I wanted to do admission
work. I had worked asa tour guide in
this ofﬁce for three years and 7 let
me be honest with you. I thoughtl
was going to graduate school, I was
going to go get my masters in public
policy, and I just began to notice that
I wasn’t filling out any of the appliv
cations. I wasn’tdoing anthing. Sol
thought, I don’t think I’m going to

Studies.”

“Iworkedmostof
the summer here. It
was the ﬁrst sum-
mer I’ve been here,
and there were no
students around or
anythingilgotused
to it, and I ﬁnally
stepped foot on
campus and it was
okay.

“And then the
students all came
back. And it was
like, okay, well,
what am I doing
here? Shouldn’t I
have left, or some-
thing? And then you get usedto that,

“We used to have a thing called
the weirdness factor. and it was
definitely up for a while, Even
coming into the Forum would be
really weird, because you’d expect
to see certain people and they aren’t
here. The funniest is, ‘Didn't you
graduate? Didn‘t you graduate?‘

“A lot of people will come up to

1889-1989: 100 Years
of Football at Grinnell

By David C. Ressner

We were burning, burning, burning,
burning...

And then someone began singing in
the darkness.

These are the closing lines of
EdwardHirseh’spoemAﬁertheLart
Practice. But this season marks the
opening of the second century of
Grinnell College football. Hirsch
graduated in 1972 among the top
four career receivers ever to catch
the Pioneer pigskin. In addition, he
went on to become one of America’s
great poets, writing After the Last
Practice in 1971 while still at Grin—
nell.

On November 16, 1889, Grinnell
College (then known as Iowa Col-
lege) met the University of Iowa’s
statewide challenge to a football
game — the first of its kind west of
the Mississippi River. Surprisingly
enough, Grinnell did not even have a
team at the time. Two students of the
sportfromaNewJerseyprepschool,
Frank Everest and Fred Van Gieson,
organized the “man squad just a
couple of weeks prior to the match
up.

The two teams contested on the
gridiron of Central Campus, justeast
of Goodnow Hall. Grinnell trounced
Iowa in a lopsided 24-0 shutout,
scoring live touchdowns, one extra
point, and a safety. For all you math
(or football) majors, you’re right; it
doesn't add up! Back then, they
played two fony-five minute halves
in which a touchdown was wonh 4
points, the extra point was actually
2, and a safety was the present-day 2
points as well,

At their inception, Grinnell was a
member of the Missouri Valley
Conference with such powerhouses
as Mizzou, Iowa State and Kansas.
In its ﬁrst six years, Grinnell gar-
nered five state championships and
won the college recognition (from
The Scarlet and Black) as the “ath-
letic stronghold of the West!"

As for this season, Coach Greg
Wallace remains "cautiously opti-
mistic" followed only by six straight
losses.

However, with the retum of pre-
season All-America picks Scott
