not stup' ty," Quirk said, “Drinking at
relays should beiun;stupid drunkenness is
not cool.” Quirk went on to say they are

being thrown at them and we want to make
that clear."

In the Same vein, the funnelator, which

Economist Gives ,
Reaganomics a “C”

by Mike Cleary

Last Thursday, Dr. Robert Haveman
spoke on the impact of President Reagan’s
revolutionary economic policies on the
economy over the last five years.

First, he explained what Reagan thought
the economic situation was when he took
office. In 1930. Reagan said that Carter
had left the economy in worse shape than
when he iound it.

From 1975 to 1981, the real growth rate of
GNP had declined irom 5 to 2%.
Unemployment had dropped rrom 7.5 to
7.2%, The inflation rate had also risen
from 6% to 12%. _

Reagan explained that the economy was
not performing as well as it could mainly
because government intervention
restrained it. “stop and go” policy
destabilized economic conditions and
prevented business from making plans.
Reagan said that no one could be certain of
government policy under Carter. Reagan
also criticized the government ior stifling

the economy directly in many ways. He
said that taxation was too high, that a
tremendous burden of regulations in-
hibited production, and that large welfare
rolls encouraged stagnation,

Reagan's prescription for the economy,
according to Haveman, iollowed the
theories of the “rational expectations"
school of economics First, Reagan ads
vocated steady policy to replace “stop and
go" policy, Second. he proposed to reduce
taxes, for this was supposed to encourage
people to work more. Third, social spen-
ding was to be reduced for two reasons.
Reagan argued that social programs tend
ed to increase reliance on government and
it would free up money for increases in the
defense budget. Lastly, Reagan said he
would eliminate wasteful regulation.

His policy proposals were a “supply-
side” prescription for the economy,
Supply-side economists. including some of
Reagan’s advisors, said the economy
would respond immediately to these
policies.

Haveman next outlined what was done
during the course of. Reagan’s administra-
tion. First. there was a major tax cut. Per-
sonal income taxes were lowered by 25%
for every citizen. Corporate taxes were
reduced considerably. Some eorporatoins
found it possible to use the tax laws so that
the government owed them money in the
end.

Next, social spending was cut. Federal

Job training, the CETA program, was
phased out Assistance to education and

Aid to Families with Dependent Children

was reduced. as well as many other pro-
grams,

Reagan started the largest peace-time
military buildup in the nation’s history. It
was incused on research and development
of new weapons and procurement of
weapons, ships, aircratt, and so iorth.

In the area of deregulation, Reagan did
not remove regulations in the areas he
mentioned most frequently. safety and
health, instead, existing regulations were
enforced much less rigorously,

Finally, Reagan worked with the
Federal Reserve in trying to achieve a
steady and Slow growth of the money supp-
ly By reducing the amount of dollars fed
into the economy to accommodate growth,
Reagan hoped to choke on inilation. This
was a turnaround from Carter’s policy of
expansionary money growth

Railroad Speed Limit -
Change Rumored

hy Jonathan Greising

Chicago Northwestern officials Tuesday
denied rumors that the firm was consider
ing raising the speed limit on the freight
line running through campus, but a local
police official acknowledged having heard
of a proposal under study.

The Chicago Northwestern trainmaster
in Marshalltown emphatically denied any
projected changes in speed for the line,
saying, "We can't run any faster, because
the college is right there. Historically, we
have always run slowly through campus."

City Supervisor Ted Claussen said he
was unaware oi any plans to change the
speed of the line. “If they are, this is the
first time I've heard about it,” he said.

Traffic safety officer Jim McClunn of
the Grinnell Police Dept. said he had
heard that a change in the limit was under
studv. When asked what the new speed

limit would be if the firm acted on the
study. McClunn said, “About iorty miles
per hour.”

McClunn said recent upgrades or cross-
ings may be associated with the prospec-
tive change.

Freight trains running through campus
currently move very slowly. McClunn in-
dicated that most travel well under 10
mph ,

Noise from the line recently provoked
complaints from South Campus students
when Chicago Northwestern began runns
ing trains through in early morning hours.
At higher speeds, the n0ise level would in-
evitably increase,

The rail firm has also had problems with
students hopping slow moving trains. Last
year, two students were arrested on one of
the trains,
