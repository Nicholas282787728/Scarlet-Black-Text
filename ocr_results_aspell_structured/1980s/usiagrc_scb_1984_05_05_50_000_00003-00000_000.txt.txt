What is Lily Tomlin doing in Steve Martin’s body?

When n‘ch, eccentric Edwina Cutwater died,
a crazy guru tried to transport her
soul into the body of a
beautiful young woman
But the guru goofed.

And Edwina's soul has
accidentally taken over
the entire right side
of her lawyer,
Roger Cobb.

He still controls
what’s left.

Now, Edwina and Roger
are living together—
in the same body.
He's losing his job.
He's losing his girlfriend.

And hejust can't seem to get
her out of his system.
No matter, how hard
he tries
