Track revved and ready

by Justin Lincoln

The outdoor track season enters its third
weekend of competititon for the Pioneers
as they travel to the State Small College
Championships at Central College tomorr
row. The teams opened the season at the
Simpson invite on April 5 and travelled to
Monmouth last weekend.

Although the squads did not fare well as
a team at Simpson, the coaches indicated
little concern because, as Coach Will
Freeman noted, the meet was used largely
ior placement purposes and as an “in-
troduction to Iowan outdoor track."

In a field of 14 teams at Monmouth, in
cluding the top iive conierence indoor
teams. the men took 4th place honors while
the Women captured 6th, The highest
placer for the men was Rob Parker, who
captured 2nd place in the 400 intermediate
Hurdles. Rob’s time of 55.29 in the race is
just less than a second off of the National
meet's qualifying standard.

The distance runners were also well»
represented at the meet Dave Wisdom
Steve Preus, and Greg Evans were
entered in the swam “in order to get a
distance workout." However, alter the
race was over, Wisdom and Preus had
finished 3rd and 4th, and all three men had
new personal records in the event. In addi-
tion. Steve Piper finished 4th in the
10,00tlm, Andy Huestis placed 6th in the
steeple chase, and the distance medley
finished third.

in the field events, Bill Strean vaulted
11'6" for 3rd, Dave Jones leapt 20'6" for
5th. and Herbie Moore highrjumped so"
for 5th. Paul McCready threw the javelin
145’s", and Henry Vogelman tossed the
shot 41' Z‘lo”, both for 6th places, The
weightme s and txzoo relays sprinted to
4th place finishes.

Coach Evelyn Freeman says that the
women competed at Monmouth under
“less than optimal conditions" as a result
oi several key athletes being unable to par»
ticipate. Yet the iact that the women plac»
ed 6th at the meet with only ten women
present speaks highly of the team’s depth.
Veronika Platzer won both of her
specialities. the shot put and discus. with
winning throws of 39'2234” and 1187"
respectively, Kim Kuncl placed 2nd in the
triple jump With 32'9”. and 4th in the 200m
dash at 28 73 Amy Amablle’s discus throw
of 102‘4” earned her 3rd place, and Shae
vaun Adams ran to a 5111.5 4th place 1500m
finish.

Both squads anticipate similar sues
cesses at tomorrow‘s highly competitive
meet. in which the Pioneers get the oppor-
tunity to compete against many quality
non-Conference athletes. The Freemans
reported that other than the Conference
meet. the state championship is the only
meet for which training is reduced in order
for the athletes to peak during perforr
mance.
