\Women’s center
suffers setback

liy May-lee Clrni

A month ago, it seemed as
though the Jeanne Bnrhle
Women‘s Center was well on its
way to becoming a reality in
Grinnell. Its advisory board had
surveyed town and campus ins
lerests and needs. They llnd
drawn up plans for a widc range
of programs to he offend, They
had succeeded in convincing the
('clltml Iowa Family Planning
\volrlrll's health or anization to
set up a branch 0 ice in townr
Thcy lrnd madc arrangements
for a lowerent, large-space facil-
ity. But before renovation work
corrld begin, their troubles be
grin,

In late August, Central Iowa
Family Planning announced that
they could no loll er be part
of [he Jeanne Burk e \‘Vonlen‘s
('cllter [JEWCl and would set
ll their ofﬁce independently.
T is JBWC had been depending

on funds from the Family Plans
ning grou to help pay for reno-
vations. hell Grillnell College
let it be known that since the‘
Women's Center was no longer
connected with the Family Plan»
rring smug, the collegc no ion er
saw yustr cation for giving tre
JBWC a previously pledged cone
lriblllion.

The problem centers around
the site chosen for the JBWC.
The Advisory Board had se-
lected a large facility on the sec-
ond floor above Hamilton Ills
surance and the old Rags to
Riches store in downtown Grin—
nell. The lease agreement guar-
antees them next to no rent for
to years so long as the Cen-
ter pnys ror the building reno-
vntions. The facility has been
vacant for several years and has
inudequate heatin and cooling
systems, among otter problems.

 

Signs vandalized

by Dnve Jones

Late last Friday night, van.
dals removed four or the new
Grinnell Colle e location signs.
Signs from in iront or Carnegie
and Steincr halls were moved, as
was the sign labeling the North
Carrrpns residence llrrlls and the
all-campus directional sign on
the corner at Park Street and
8th Avenue.

Artcr bcing unholted from
their bases, the signs were
placed in what some observers
described as a mock graveyard
near the Zirlrle sculpture on

Central Campus. There they
were discovered by Buildings
and Grounds personnel later
that night.

Dale stn, director of the
physical plant reported that no
damage was done to the signs,
which were put back Wednes-
day afternoon. He also indicated
that he has no idea who might
have moved them. “Tth were
very carefully removed. in was
to mnlrc any ucsses, i would say
it was a pran he said.

Since lown Central Family
Planning receives federal runds,
it is required that their for
cilities be ncccssiblc to handi-
capprrl persons. The secanrl~
story space is accessible via
a chair lift and was originally
deemed acceptable by thc Faul-
ily planning group. However,
the legal deﬁnition of a racile
ity that is accessible to hand-
icapped pcrsons requires that
there be ramps or an elevator.
As a result, the Family Plath
rrirrg group backed out of their
original agreement and made ar—
rangenlents for a small down~
town otiice with just enough
space for a waiting room and a
medical examination room.

nonuced that they were with

Jeanne Burkle Women's Cen-
ter since the Family Planning
group clisnssociated itself from
the Women’s Center. Jamcs Tee

“What appened was, when

Peace Institute

by Dave Jones

Its goals include conflict reso-
lrrtiorr, research into the. causcs

Another important benefit in
choosing Grillnell is the town's
location. Grinnell is equidistant

as well as Iowa's two main citics,
making the institute very access

Although the institute will not
be situated on cam )us or be rif—
nliated with the college, Ander-
son strcsses, “wc want to ho rear
sonably close to the campus.“
Since Grinnell oircrs no‘smnmer-
school courses, college facil' es
would be available {or tlle'lnstir
lute to use for seminars.

"A major factor was the college’s and
community’s long-standing reputation
and obvious interest in peace efforts.” ‘

NATO ambassador

Fear of the United States’ die
lninishing concern for the So-
viet tllreal towards Western lia-
tions prompted Guy dc Mnyser,
the ambassador from Luxenls

Treaty Orgallization(NATO), to
come to Grinncll and lecture last
weekend, Grinnell was one of

a slide presentation/lecture en-
titled “Oppositionist Art and
Contemporary Soviet Society.”
Both were intended to explain
NATO‘s role in security issues
and to emphasize the impore
tance or blocking Soviet expan»

People in the Unitcd States
are much less concerned about

time," he said. “France had
once for is long time More the
orld Wars, and all ora sudden,
they were in den er,"

De Muyser exp sined the dif-
rercnt positions or the United
States and Europe, “When i
rome to the U.S., I have a helm
of a secure, stable, sane worl .
it is an isolated, safe island. In
Luxembourg we have Russian
Lanlrs 200' to 300 miles from our
border. it is a lunch diirerent

ire slso commented that not
only does the threat still exist,
brrt it also has expanded. it is no
longer just an East/West prob-
lem, for there are crisis centers
in places such as Nicaragua and
the Persian Gulf.

Another concern ofDe Mliyser
is America's skepticism about
keeping costly troops in Europe.
Because European nations are

This is where the importance
or NATO comes in. NATo
was rounded in 1949 to guard
against the Soviet threat to Elle

Canada and to try to stop the
expansion of the Soviet Union

up of sixteen notions, NATO
