Black Cultural Center
offers student retreat

by Anju Goel

The Black Cultural Center
(BCC) was established in 1970 to
provide a place to which black
students can "retreat from the
general community to be with
other black people," says Rita
Rawson. Rawson is one of two
student monitors who live at the
center and who volunteer to
maintain the house and "keep it
looking respectable" Being black
and living in a predominantly
white town and campus can be
difficult, she says, so black stu-
dents use the house for support
and to get a "taste of home"
again. The house, which has a
black library. bedrooms. a gue-
stroom, and a television room,
also "maintains unity within the
black community."

Events at the house include

Drake discusses 10 year:

lectures, receptions, parties, and
study breaks. An all-campus
study break and another Fireside
Lecture are planned for the first
week in October. In addition to
these events, meetings for The
Black Women's Support Group,
Concerned Black Students, and
occasionally other groups, such
as the Women's Group. hold
meetings in the BCC. Perspec-
tive students and their parents
occasionally stay at the house.
Rawson thinks the house
continues to be a successful pro—
ject, from which virtually all the
black students and many white
students benefit. She stresses

that although the house is called
the Black Cultural Center. ALL
Grinnell College students are
welcome and encouraged to visit
the house

President George Drake, speaking on his first 10 years at
Grinnell at last week's Scholar's Convocation, said the
college must work to attract more minority students and
faculty, Drake also discussed strengthening fine arts and

Tindall takes over physical plant

Continued from Page 1

Besides running 8&6,
Tindall supervises all lady
custodians (maids). Unlike
Hawn, Tindall encourages the
custodians to get "to know the
students." Increased interaction
could let the custodians deal with
smaller problems within the
dormitory.

Furthermore, Tindall will
also be involved with all building
renovations. Besides ARI-l, both
Steiner and Goodnow will be
renovated. Tindall is also
preparing for the construction of
the new Student Social Center
and an addition to Fine Arts. The
new director hopes that he will be
able to address the physical and
mechanical aspects of the
renovations, without being in-
volved in the political process
Also, dorm lounges will be
renovated to their original condi-
tion, and Tindall hopes tlley re»
main that way

"I would hope that students
would have enough pride in their
environment to treat it with re-
spect. i think you can party hard
without destroying the stuff that
you have to continue to live with
on a day to day basis."

$30 000 grant makes center possible
Service Center opens in Mears

by Jennifer Watson

This year, Grinncll College
received a $30,000 thrccrycar
ACTION grant from the the Fed-
cml Voluntccr Agency. The
money was used to Crcalc the
Community Service Center
which is located on Mcars Third.
The new center will work with
existing campus and community
service groups and provide orga-
nizational support for any new
projects that students want to
start. "Our goal," said Heather
Kcnvin, the center's coordinator,
" is to get as many students in-
volved as possible. We want to
have at least fifteen places that
they can get involved which i
think is pretty realistic since
there are about ten or clcvcn right
now."
The primary purpose of the
center is to help students put
their own ideas into action and to
provide contacts and transporta-
tion if needed, Survey cards were
sent out last week asking slur
dents in what areas they would be
most interested in working, Lit-

crucy, battered women, and the
elderly were the three mentioned
most often.

The center will be starting
projects of its own such as a lit-
eracy program and working with

Kcnvitl also emphasized that
most of the projccls will serve
the Grinncll area. "Therc‘s a lot
of hidden needs in Grinncll.” she
stated. "Wc‘re used to seeing

there."
