curious as to why there will again he a new
Coach. bringing the total number of
changes in the volleyball coaching staff to
3 in the past four years.

Dee Fairchild, the incoming athletic
director, explained that McCarty’s posir
tion was only a tweayear temporary facui
ty position, and the position would be
eliminated after this year. Fairchild
noted, however. that the department tried
to extend the position into a full-time per-
manent position. but with many other
departments wanting more positions, it
was just notpossible. Said Fairchild nchr
Carty: “Deb brought a great deal of suc-
cess to the volleyball program and we’ll
miss her at Grinnell".

Two other changes will be happening at
the PEC shortly, Assistant Football and
Men’s Baseball coach Jlm Gilbert will

however, by last Saturday's loss to Illinois
College, 7s7i.

The Coe game, one of four conference
games on the Women's schedule this
month, proved to be the best team effort of
the season. Coach Dee Fairchild said,

he women played very well as a team,

h is really the first time since the
beginning of the season." She continued,
noting unat; “It was our first game without
Deb Eastman, who Went to Costa Rica this
semester. While We' miss her skill on the
court, her absence has forced us to rely on
a more balanced offense."

Leading the cohesive offense was junior
captain Liz schumacher Schumacher led
both teams in scoring with 23 points, while
teammate Elizabeth Mchmsey added 11

To compliment the offense’s pal-fora
manCe the defense stood strong. tallying 14
steals to Coe’s 5, Especially active in this
aggressive defensive play was freshman
Jessica Toft at point; Jessica led Grinnell
with 9 steals.

Saturday’s game against Illinois Col-
lege, however. proved to he more of a
struggle for the defense. The Lady Blues of
lllinois College combined scoring and re
bounding talent to defeat the Lady
Pioneers here at home.
