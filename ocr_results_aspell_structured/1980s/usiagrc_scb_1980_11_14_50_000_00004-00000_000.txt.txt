Marc Conterato feels SGA needs so
meone who can “offer alternative Vier
points," He said, “There are always
two or three ways of looking at issues."

A junior biology major, he said, “The
vicepresident’s job requires a lot of
organization, thinking, working under
stress; Ilhink I can do that. l think I
work best under pressure."

“SGA is closed," he said. “Anyone
who wants to break in is choked off.
Snmetima SGA is too concerned with
itself.” He pointed out that he wants to
see it become possible ior more
students to get involved.

He indicated that the closing of Hie
Health Center is Hie biggest issue fac-
ing the college today. He favors using
Grinneli General Hospital rather than
having a health center on campus. In
general. he views the job of vice
president as “an alternative source of
ideas."

Julia McCray

A sophomore, Julia McCray holds the
appointed post of administrative assis-
tant to the cabinet of SGA. She wants to
move up to a higher position because
“there's a limited amount I can do at
my present job and I'd like to do more
than just type and file."

She said her experience should count
for a lot, noting, “This year’s cabinet
works well together, It would be harder
on a new person.“

She also said she is aware of the
Critisism that SGA is closed and corn-
mented, “I’ll have to run against my
reputation as an ‘SGA-type.’ "

McCray’s goal as vicevpresidenl
would be to “streamline” SGA. She
feels the constitution should be re»
examined, committees should be
“cleaned up,” and the budget should be
reassessed. She also said the vice

president will have iniluence on the
F-grade decision. She is in favor or an
F, but said, “I don’t intend to impose
my views on the rest of the students,"

As an overall view of the job, McCray
offered these thoughts: "The vice-
president is one of the most enjoyable
posts in the son. I’m not going to law
school, so I'm not just doing this for my
record. I just enjoy it. It's a practical
education,"

Tuesday, Nov. 13, marks the election of a new SGA vice- -
president. If no candidate wins at least 50 percent of the vote, a
run-off will be held between the two top vote getters. John Con-
yers was elected to the post last spring, but resigned on Oct. 29

because of academic problems.

Originally, five people were vying for the office, but one can—
didate, Bill Stowe, said he will probably drop out of the race.
Stowe said he will base his decision on Julia McCray’s eligibili-
ty to hold office. Due to an ambiguity in the SGA bylaws, Mc-
Cray, a sophomore, went before the College Judicial Council
(JC) lastnight to ask for a ruling on her eligibility. At the time
of this printing the question was still unresolved. Stowe said he
will drop out if the JC declares McCray eligible, however, if Mc-
Cary is ruled ineligible, Stowe said he will stay in the race.

Stowe said he and McCary feel they are both qualified for the
job. In addition, Stowe stressed, “The last thing I want to see is

one of these (other) jokers with the trite cliches in the office,”
Stowe, currently hall president for Langan Hall, also said, “I’d
rather serve on the Joint Board anyway.” Stowe indicated he
was confident the Judicial Council would rule in favor of Mc-
Cary. He asked the $821} to withhold his interview because he

Doug Rowe

A junior history major, Doug Rowe
wants to see “more than a lew Circles"
in SGA. He said it is comprised of “a
small group that is unrepresentative of
the college community."

He feels that as vice-president he will
be able to offer different views, and his
philosophy would be to “do what the
people want instead of governing
them." As an example, he said, “Many
studean are distressed with the quality
of concerts." His solution is that “SGA
will simply have to put more money in-
to concerts to get bigger names.”

expected to withdraw from the race.

He said son will need to "lmprove
the budget for next semester,” and
"many opinions need to be expressed,
not just those of the group oi
SGA-types."

Right now, Rowe is hall president ior
Loose, and therefore a representative
to the Joint Board. However, he noted
that “The vicepresident has mor
responsibility" and he would like th
job.
