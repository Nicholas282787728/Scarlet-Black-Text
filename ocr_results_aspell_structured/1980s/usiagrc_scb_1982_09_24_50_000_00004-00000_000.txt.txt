Campus media need

staff continuity

The campus media, including KDIC, the Cyclone, the Grinnell
Review and the Sea rlei and Black, have a major problem establishing
continuity among the li' nersonneli

Lack of student particpationr in administrative work, writing and
editing causes trouble when editors, managers, etc. must be chosen.
The Cyclone may be lucky this time because, as a result of the arrival
of last year’s books and a plea from SP&R, half a dozen people have
applied to be this year‘s editor of that publication.

Until a few days ago, though, the future of the yearbook looked
bleak. Many seniors despaired at the possibility of not having their
years at Grinnell immortalized in the tome. Does a campus publica-
tion have to come so close to extinction to merit the attention and par-
ticipation of students at Grinnell?

Grinnell Review Editor Beth Vilen has expressed her concern that
very few people will be qualified to edit and manage the Review next
year because so many on the current staff are seniors. She said her
staff is trying to recruit underclassmen to train for following years
but, as of now, there are only two or three freshmen and one junior in»
volved in work for the Review

KDIC has fewer problems filling its managing positions but the sta-
tion, also, is not entirely free of worry on that account. Station
Manager Chris Ertel emphasizes that KDIC can always use more
help. There are seven staff members at KDIC and most of them have
two or three assistants.

In the past, the 8&8 has had to fill its editorships by default. More
than once recently there has been only one applicant for an editorial
position. SPStR members would not hire a candidate they did not feel
was competent, regardless of the lack of other applicants, but having
absolutely no competition certainly does not help to ensure that the
person who gets the job is the most qualified for it.

SPELR is supposed to appoint all the editors for the following year in
May. However, this year the positions of second semester editor-in-
chief, sports editor and diversions editor are still open. There are not
enough people on the staff now to move into the other positions so an
influx of new personnel is imperative. .

One suggestion, made by a current media head, is that Grinnell
emplay a full-time campus media consultant. This person would take
charge of training the editors and managers to help ensure that one
year’s editor, for example, is as knowledgeable at the last. He or she
could also teach a course in professional media practices and techni-
ques. There are an estimated 150 people on campus involved in some
part of the media and if only one-tenth of these students were in
terested in a media course there would be enough to fill a class.

An immediate solution to this problem, however, is for more people
to become involved in some aspect of the media. Many, perhaps most,
of those 150 are graduating seniors so underclassmen should consider
such involvement because they are the ones who could work their way
to the top positions, thereby gaining the experience necessary to do a
good job. This continuity within the various publications and KDIC
would ensure we no longer encounter the imminent discontinuation of
any campus medium.

SASG refutes Adelman

In last week's 5&8, Kenneth Adelman
gave his opinion of the responsibility of
Americans towards South Africa, This are
ticle is a response to some of his claims
and fallacies Mr . Adelman stated, “South
Africa is not the worst offender of human
rights in the world," in terms of “cracking
down on such basic freedoms as religion,
speech and assembly." In South Africa, it
is against the law to speak out against
apartheid and the government. or to write
in opposition to them. Condemning apar-
[held in speech or press can be cause for
arrest or banning When a person is bannr
ed s/he cannot travel, speak iii public
or be quoted in print. Over 1400 people
have ‘been banned since 1961, As for
religion, blacks are forbidden to enter
several white churches, such as the Dutch
Protestant Church. Basic human freedom
is violated by daily bannings, laws which
require passbooks restricting freedom
of movement and laws which allow blacks
to be arrested without warrants and held
in detention and Incommunicado without
explanation

Mr Adelmali also stated. "I believe.
myself. that the business community is the
most progressive community in all of
South Africa " The business Community ill
South Africa. like the business commun \‘
many country. must uphold that counii
laws Apartheid is the law in South Africa

As progressive as any corporation may b t
it must work within the laws of the Sout
African government. A United State
government survey of United States C0
porations in South Africa found that ther
are no blacks in a position of authorit
over whites in any company. The Sulliva
principles, calling for desegregation of th
work place and fair employment pra
tices, were originally seen as progressive
now they are regarded as ineffective, onl
useful to pacify angry critics in the Unite
Slates Finally, it is important to note no
only how businesses hire; but wha
businesses do (e g. supplying loans, com
puters and vehicles to the government) t
See how the corporations in South Afrlc
help to maintain the Apartheid system.
Speaking about divestment, Mr
Adelman said, “I have never met a blac
South African, who lives in South Afrlc
who is for disinvestment of outside in

Sarcastically, Grinnell

This column is somewhat of an extenSion
of last week’s column but with a certain
twist. I title this week's Column ”HOW to
Study without Really Trying’ The Grinncll
Ethos ” Last week I espoused the fact that
Grinncll's area of study, mainly the
library, was actually a place to play But
how do these Grinnellians get such
ivondcrtul grades when not even their
library is a quiet haven"

Well first we have to enlighten ourselves
on the theory of studying. First we should
define the word What is studying. and is
that the correct term'7 For the fresh new
faces on campus who used to bring their
assignments home from school, Studies
come in the phrase, "Oh, I have so much
homework‘.” But, kids, now you live at
school and the phrase no longer applies
Many people on campus disdain studies so
much that they relate studies with the
phrase, “Oh. but I have so much work to
do.” Which always get the response, “Are
you working now?” You must really think
that studies are mundane if you associate
studies with work. I guess there is no real
correct phrase for studies because the idea
means different things to different people.
Some people do really like to study (I have
pen to be one of them), but only on the sen
cond Tuesday of each week,

Why do so many of us procrastinate so
much'! Why can't we simply sit down and
do our work all in one pile and then use the
huge block of extra time more efficiently?
When you think about it, it really is aman
ing that as college students we cannot sit
down and do our work Now you are pro
bably all yelling out, but we can‘t sit
around and study all the time, we just
can't concentrate for that long a period
of time Well that excuse does not work.
Psychology tells us that you can concenr
tratc for as long as you want to, but when
you think that you are tired then you will
be. Now, doesn’t that make you feel like
you are a failure? in the time we, as

students, spend yapping about how much
studying we have to do, we could play a
few good sets of tennis.

why do you think we spend so much tim
complaining about how much we have i
do" Well, we probably would’never admi
it but we are all in some kind of Compeli
tion over who has the most to do We al
want to hear about how much work Joh
has to do because if we have more it make
us feel like such significant individuals.
The same goes for the reason we all bitc
about how hard our classes are, It make‘
us feel good when we think that our class?
are so hard. so when we do poorly in them
we can say, “Gee. but you can‘t imagin
how hard that class was!" Or if you got a
good grade in the course you can say,
"God, I'm so proud ofmyself!” is studying
really all that difficult? If you think about
it, all we have been doing for most of our
lives is Studying, Since first grade we
would come home from school, Mom of
course took care of all the details in life,
and we would simply study, If we haven't
got it right by now I mink we're in serious
trouble.

Granted, the studies themselves can b
difficult, but they are rarely impossible
Our problem is that we can’t sit down an-
study for a significant amount of time. My
expertise in the area of studying is the in
genious excuses i have for taking a study
break every five or six minutes. M
favorite way of extending my break is to
say, Oh, I might as well take five minutes
more; I should start on the hour or, i really
should play pool so I'll be relaxed before i
start work. There are absolutely hundreds
of ways to procrastinate and we don’t even
need to have an overcactive imagination to
think of them I‘m sure that each of us
could list 20 of our own excuses without
having to think hard about it What I would
like to hear Grinnellians Say is, “Yes I
have a lot of work but i Want to pro
crastinate anyway." Basically (Correct-
ness Corner, did I spell that one right'iY i, if
we are procrastinating it is because we
wish to procrastinate. There are no genes
that make Mary a good studier, one who
sils down and does her work because she
