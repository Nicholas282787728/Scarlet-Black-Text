Day care center needs help

by Terri Porter

NationWlde budget cuts have had a
devastating effect on federally subsidized
programs, The Grinnell Community Day
Care Center is just one of the programs
that has seen a drastic decline in available
monies.

Day Care Center Director Joyce Peak
summed up the situation simply, saying,
”We are in dire straits ﬁnancially,”
Enrollment is down about 55 percent from
three years ago as a result of several
speclal programs being cut. These pro-
grams included the Title 20 program which
provided funding for abused or neglected
children. Another program, one which pro-
vided work incentive for parents while the
children were cared for at the center was
also eliminated. The enrollment dropped
from 15 children three years ago to zero
Currently. In addition, children in the rural
areas of Poweshiek County cannot attend
the Center due to lack of funds for
transportation, The list of cutbacks cons
tinues, and, as Peak noted. “The number
or kids affected is the biggest concern."

The center provides supervised ac
tivities for children whose parents are in
volved in activities outside the home dur
ing the day. Supervision is shared by paid

teachers and volunteer students trom the
college. The increase in budget cuts
resulted in a decrease in paid employees
For this reason the center is looking tor
college students willing to volunteer some
ol their time to work with the children.

According to Peak, they are looking tor
people who are “pretty seltmotivoted,"
since the students olten will be working
with a small group basically on their own.
Peak stated, “We prefer to have the
volunteers work at least an hour at a time
7 longer if possible.” she added that there
should be a lairly consistent schedule as
tar as days and times at volunteering.
Peak noted that work at the center would
provide good experience in working with
children, both in a group and individually.
she commented, “We really need more
people for more onectoene interaction
with the children.”

The experience is a very rewarding one,
according to students who have or are cur»
rently working there. Ann Justice, who
worked at the Center all of last year,
stated, “I enjoyed mostly just being with
the children." She added, “It's also really
nice working with the community instead
oi’ just on campus." Jeanenne Grounds,

and is currently volunteering there, shares
many of the same ieelings. She remarked,
“There are enough activities so the kids
don‘t get bored. It's a lot diiierent trom a
preschool because it involves more
mothering.” Grounds would recommend

the program to other students, emphasiz-
ing, “It‘s a great break from campus, and
it doesn’t take up too much time.”

CSL seeks student input on SA. program

by Dan Nissenbaum

Next week, 200 randomly chosen
students will receive a questionnaire
designed to assess student opinion oi the
student advisor program. This new ques
tionnaire should not be confused with the
standard evaluation of each SA; the new
three page iorm is an el'fortoi' the Commit
tee on Student Life to review the current
SA program in view oi recent changes and
to update the last program review.

Relerring to the study. Fiossie Mitchell,
associate dean of student affairs and
chairperson of the CSL SA-Subcommittee,
explained, "We're just looking for the best
advising program that we call gel Such

a program is extremely important to a
highly residential college, especially one
that stresses self-governance in the
dorms,"

The changes in the program that Mit~
chell incorporated since her arrival last
year include additions to the selection pron
Cess, to provide “as [air and thorough a
process as possmle."

These additions stipulate an initial inter-
View ior all new applicants, an evaluative
conference with the RA [or all returning
SA's and also a group interview Iurther in-
to the admission process when six ap-
plicants will work cooperatively on an

Bands, booths, and bananas benefit
United Way

by Karyn Reit

How many bananas can you eat in 15
minutes? As one oi the events at the SGA
carnival for the Grinnell chapter of United
Way, Clayton Parks and Tracey Wold will
take on challengers in a bananaeating
contest; the winner will receive three pits
chers of beer from ThePub.

The carnival is sponsored by the Student
Coordinator’s Office, which hopes to raise
$1500-2000 for United Way. SGA will match
proceeds up to $500. and food service will
donate money for all who participate in die
FOG iast this evening. According to Assis~
tant Student Coordinator Wold, the oilice
thinks that it is “very important to do
things that are not solely [or the benefit of
the students,” She also says “the town of
Grinnell gives us a lot and it's good to help
the community in which we're living,”

One of the highlights of the carnival will
be a dunk tank, in which Jim Tederman,
Wally Walker and a special mystery guest
will get wet. In addition to the dunk tank
there will be at least 10 dormrsponsored
booths, including a kissing booth run by
Pine Tree House. Tickets for the dunk tank
will be $1, while those for all other events
will he 25 cents. The dorm that brings in
the most tickets will win a Baskin-Rnbbins
study break. The carnival takes place
tomorrow_in Darby Gym irom 1:30 to 5
pm. Music and tree soda will be provided
throughout the afternoon and rallies will
be held periodically. Prizes include
Irisbees, pea- -shoolers and Risk and

assigned task. Chaired by Mitchell, the in-
terviewing committee consists of students
and die RA’s.

General inlormation sessions preceding
me first interviews allow for an explanan-
tion of these changes and also serve to “en-
courage people to think about how they see
themselves in the position,” stated Mit-
Chell. Floor evaluations are still weighed
heavily in the appraisals. Despite this
comprehensive procedure, there were
twice as many applicants as positions last
year.

The iinal change in the original SA pro-
gram involves continuous in-service train-
ing both before students arrive on campus
and throughout the semester. Mitchell at»
tributes this idea to suggestions made by
students in last year's SA questionnaires.
This training, for the individual hall coun-
cils and the whole group, includes handling
crisises and specific (topics like academic
problems. A student “in service commit—
tee" recommends the topics to Student Af-
lairs for use in the training sessions

The SA subcommittee opted for a
smaller sample of students to receive the
questionnaire over an all-campus distribu-
tion in the hopes of receiving a more
representative sample of student opinion
and making the data more manageable.

“I really encourage people to take the
time to complete these questionnaires,”
Mitchell stressed, “It’s the chance to ex-
press your opinion.” The results of this
survey will determine much of the subs
committee’s recommendations to CSL. If
approved, CSL will act on those conclu-
sions to modily the SA program.

Oncampus students should return their
{arms to their RA‘ s, and those oifcampus
should send them to ﬁle Student Affairs Oi-
lice.
