January ﬁnalization expected ‘
on Health Center relocation

by Kim McDonald

A relocation of the College Health
Center to Grinnell General Hospital is
“quite possible as early as next Sep-
temberﬂ according to Wally Walker.
executive vice-president or the college.
But he stresssed that negotiations with
Hie hospital have not been finalized and
me proposd change is still tentative,

The idea has been mentioned to the
Hospital Board, said Walker. They
have given their approval to pursue the
idea and are currently awaiting a more
detailed plan from the college with ex-
act dollar amounts.

The college currently receives about
$30,000 in health fees from the students.
Walker said a relocation would pres
bably raise lees slightly.

When asked how student opposition to
the plan would affect the administrar
tion's decision. Walker replied, “Obe
viously, the administration takes the
prerogative of making the decision."
He added, “Anyone that would object
(to the move) would have to be petulent
in objecting . l . it would be like so
meone saying 'I don’t want a $1,000
raise’.”

Contrary to what the 5&3 reported
last week, Walker says that the college
will not be “deeply involved" in ﬁle hire
ing of the staff, Jim Tederman, dean of
Student Affairs, said last that the col-
lege would Want to hire a director for
the service, but Walker demes this
However, Walker says that ﬁle hospital
is exploring the possibility oi hiring an
emergency room physician According
to Paul Volker. SGA president, the col-
lege would like to be involved in this
decision,

Walker hopes the otiiee oi Student
Allah's will develop an in-service train
ing program to acquaint the nurses at
Grinnell General with student at-
titudes, since students are accustomed
to different services and methods.

Walker felt “it doesn't seem
rational" to hire a special director
since a $15,000 or $20,000 salary would
only take away trom the $30,000 or
$40,000 college contract.

Walker does not see me possibility of
improving the Health Center as an
alternative to relocation. Town doctors
have relused to work out at the Health
Center and the cost to the College of hire
ing an oneampus doctor would be “pro-
hibitive."

He added that most Schools with their
own campus doctor aren‘t happy.
Students have their own personal likes
and dislikes when it comes to doctors,

he claimed, so it’s almost impossible to
find a doctor that a majority oi students
would like,

How the change will affect students
and the current nurses was discussed at
the SGA meeting last week. Volker
found reaction generally in iavor of die
proposal, although there were certain
important questions raised.

Irma Hall, the day shift nurse at the
Health Center tor the past 25 years, was
planning on retiring in two and onerhalf
years, She is personally disappointed
since she would like to have finished her
working years at Grinnell,

Hall said she hopes the new system
will work out well. She realizes that
students will miss “the mother aspect"
that she and Donna Bailey currently
provide, but thinks it will be possible for
students to develop relations of some
sort with the hospital staff. Commen~
ting on student complaints about the
current hospital staff, she said “We do
get feedback now and then."

However, she attributes many com-
plaints to those students who use the
Health Center unnecessarily, These
students encounter staff which doesn‘t
think their problem is as great as the
student assumes.

Hall doesn’t see the improvement of
the Health Center as a possibility
either, given their limited tunds, the
current facilities, and the legal aspects
involved. She cited the fact that the
Health Center is able “to do a little
more every year and much more than
when I came.“

Hall doesn’t really know what exactly
it is that students want added or im-
proved, nuting that the women “would
like a gynecologist, but then men might
want an orthopedist,” and there is no
end to what students “would like.”

Volker found the plan has questions
which are “not easily answerable.” He
added that, “We’ve got to insure we
work out the transportation issue for

we’ll get gypped."
