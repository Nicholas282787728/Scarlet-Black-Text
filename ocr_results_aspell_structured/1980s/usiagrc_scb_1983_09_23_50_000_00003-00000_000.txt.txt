Town and gown
A look at the College and the Community

 

by Eric Lusk

The history or the College's relationship

with the town of Grinnell really started
with J.B. Grinnell himself. When J B,
Grinnel] came to Iowa 111 the 135%, he envi»
sloned founding a town that would be has
ed on the precepts oi a New England town
similar to the one he lived in when he was
in Vermont. Grinnell was a nineteenth-
century reformer. In that era, the label oi
relormer was associated with temperance
and morality. Grinnell bought land from
the government and realized that it would
become valuable if he hung on to it long
enough. He knew that a college and
railroad would enhance the land’s value
further When Iowa College in Davenport,
Iowa, sent letters to neighboring towns or
lering the college, Grinnell accepted the
offer and gave the college the land it need»
ed.
' Almost immediately, Grlnnell College
became a part at progresslvism: in 1359
John Brown stopped on to visitJ.B. Grine
nell before he headed for Harper's Ferry.
Progresstvism in Grinnell was manilested
in many ways: in addition to being an
abollshlonist, .13, took steps in the fight
ior equality among the sexes. Gnnnell Cole

cluded women.

The town and College were Closely tied
in those days. The majority oi the students
were from Iowa, attended the town's Con-
gregational churches, and until 1919, with
the exception of Mears Hall, lived in boar-
ding houses in town.

During the Great Administration of the
18705, .l.B, Grinnell, the town, and the Col-
lege again took a critical view against an
established institution: against the corrup-
tion of the Grant Administration and
against this country’s railroad

monopolies. indeed, J.B. Grinnell was a
preacher, an abolitionist, a u.s.
Representative, and an outspoken critic or
what he considered immoral.

J.B went so lar as to outlaw alcohol in
the city limits. Not until 1960 did the town
or Grinnell have a liquor store. For a hun-
dred years Grinnell College students
travelled to Newton ior alcohol. When the
lust liquor store opened in town the
students responded with a parade on the
opening day.

“Since World War II
on, the town has had

mixed views about

the College."

with the turn oi the century, Grinnell
College moved into dorms and made fewer
trips to the church. But the town and Cole
lege had not lost any of their moral inclina-
[Ions in politics, In 1912 Woodrow Wllson
campaigned through the town on the Rock
Island Railroad, The College men held a
mock convention; the women of the Col-
lege unexpectedly joined the event posing
as women sutieragettesr Women’s suffra-
ge found support at the College irom the
faculty wives, however, women’s suffrage
found little support from the town.

In the 19305, a time when the only
building to go up was Darby Gymnasium,
the College out back on stalt and iaculty.
The depression saw another change,
however, the town voted one way, the col-
lege another It was a Republican town
and a Democratic College.

Prolessor Alan Jones, who attended
Grinnell alter World War 11, recalled that
the years he spent at the College were
sprinkled with brawls that developed in
the Legionalres' Hall between war
veterans from the College and the
veterans lroni the town. This was the only
time that Jones could recollect as having
repeated violent confrontations between
studenB and townspeople. Jones remark-
ed “Since World War ii on, the town has
had mixed views about the college. It's
hard to generalize about the town as a
whole though."

The College, while having detractors in
the town, did not lose its understandable
attraction to the businesses of the town.
During the 19505, the town and College
split on McCarthyism. Jones suggested a
view that Grinnell College has generally
taken a certain view at American Politics
and the College subsequent task: that of “a
College at Civilizing the wilderniss." Crine
nell College’s President Bowen opposed
the loyalty oath that men had to sign to
receive Federal Financial Aid 111195657.

Later in the 19505, Political Science Pros
iessor Ed Gilmore ran lor state Represen-
tative against a local politician, and won.
Gilmore's political success was iollowed
by more activity by the College. In 1960
Professor Jones became chairman oi the
county's Democratic Party, Then m 1964,
the town and the College both voted overe
whelmingly Democratic.

Today, the town and College have some
basic diiierences. The town votes
predominantly Republican, with the
residents south oi Highway is voting
Democratic. The College is predominantly
Democratic, as the last poll concluded.
The town and College have lost their
original religious ties, although there is
hardly a total lack of religiois iaith on
campus,

The town and College have grown apart
in some respects, but there is plenty or
mutual recognition. A Grinnell College ad-
ministrator, who preferred anonymity,
Said that the Chamber of Commerce has
made its opinion ielt by acknowledging the
economic contributions of the students and
faculty to the town. signs greeting
students back are clearly in evidence in
store windows

The town and College have repaired
most of the schisms that developed in the
1960's and early 1970s As Jones said,
“There have been younger people that
have moved into town, with some of the
younger businessmen and women who
have been away, been to universities
around the country." Jones said that the
town's participation in College fund
raisers, and College participation in town
fund-drives (such as the SGA and United
Way) have added to positive relations bet-
ween the two. The use of the Physical
Education Complex by the townspeople
has also aided relations.

The town oi Crinnell has what the
founder originally intended: a town that is
morally temperate and a college that still
oilers constructive criticism to the rest ol
the country.

 

 

The time of agrument then was split
over, naturally, the Vietnam War. As
Jones explained, the College was seen as
radical by the town because of the
College's campus demonstrations, but
even then, students or townspeople never
turned to violence. The townspeople did
not join the college marches insignificant
numbers after President Nixon sanctioned
the bombing ol Hanoi in 1972, but they did
not resort to violence, either. The College
was good at easing the town’s antipathy.
After the Vietnam War had strained the
relationship between the town and the Col-
lege, students, in order to try to mend
those relations held Community Days in
1971-72, which consisted at doing volunteer
work in the town.

One of the other few points of contention
between the town and College was when
some elements of the local population
became distressed at the number of black
students at the College. Jones said, “There
were some charges oi harrassment or
black students. The City Council tried to
mediate that, [it] set up a human rights
commission. There really were no major
incidents."
