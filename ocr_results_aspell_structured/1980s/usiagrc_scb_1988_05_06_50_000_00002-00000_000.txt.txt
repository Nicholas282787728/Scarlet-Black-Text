Students
Tutor
Through-
out the
County

When Grinnell College tutoring
is mentioned, what generally
comes to mind is the program
within the college that is arranged
and paid ior by the math depart.
ment and student Attairs, There is
also a tutoring program that Grinr
nell students and iaciiity take part
in ior the local high school on a
strictly volunteer basis, This pro-
gram, only a year old, grew out oi
the Grinnell 2000 program two
years ago, when the idea oi a
volunteer coordinator was propos-
ed and subsequently adopted by
the Grinnell-Newburg school
district Says volunteer coor»
dlnator Kristy Leath, “As iar as i
know, that had never been done
before."

According to Protessor Henry
Walker (mathematics), the tutor»
ing sessions are mostly arranged
on an individual reierral system.
Says Walker, “ll the teacher
believes that the student might
beneiit irom tutoring, the teacher
may talk to the coordinator or
volunteers." Similarly, the
sludean may seek tutoring on
their own. The tutoring sessions
are then arranged iirst according
to the amount oi time the tutor and
the student have free, and then ac
cording to needs and abilities. The
tutoring sessions generally start
out as an hour to an hour
and a hall per week, and according
to guidance counselor Richard
Bachmann, at Grinnell's high
school the most common requests
are ior tutors in the sciences
(especially biology),
mathematics, and occasionally
social studies and history. Says
Bachmann. “Those are probably
the iour subject areas or classes
students have the most concerns
about."

Unlike the college tutoring pro
gram, in which tutoring is done by
students ior students, the high-
school program, according to
Walker, has tutors “from all
aspects oi the town," where there
are “a lot or sources ot expertise,
ranging irom iaculty to senior
citizens at the Mayflower retire
ment home “They're active in all

sorts oi things." says Walker. And
while the tutors within the college
are paid, the highschool tutoring
is done “by the graciousness oi the
individualsY hearts," explains
Leath. This system also has
economic beneiits in that. because
the tutors' hours are basically
donated, there is an “effective in
crease in the budget oi the school
district,” according to Walker.

So iar there are over 20
volunteers, and Leath adds. “1 see

At the moment there are eight
highrschool students receiving
tutoring, as well as requests ior
tutors irom juniorhlghrschool
students, and Bachmann admits,
“Sometimes I wish more students
would take part inlt.”Allin all,the
tutoring program so iar has been
seen as very successiul. Says
Leath, “I'm hearing really good
leedback irom the students on the
help that they're getting."

litter the question-and-answei’
period with Jim Tederman and
Donna Bailey concerning the
Health Center, Joint Board got or
with its regular meeting. Possibly
the most larrreaching action was
an attempt to install new Election
Board bylaws. The iirst proposed
bylaw would limit the number of
people who could receive came
paign literature to 30 per cane
didate. This was to comply with a
ruling by Bill Deminoii concerning
mailing campaign materials.
However, it was unclear just how
much force Deminoff’s ruling had
and how fair it was to candidates,
The bylaw was tabled. The second
bylaw proposed barring all signs
from the dining-hall doors and wins
dows and was amended to include
Forum doors and windows. This
would tellectlhe policies of the
operators of those areas. That one
passed ior the iirst oi two required
times. The third bylaw would bar
write-in votes irom appearing on
runoff ballots; however, they
would still be present on election
ballots for the first round This mos
