Dole

by Gene McClure

When deciding which candidate
to support tor president, voters
Should consider which candidate
has proven hirnselt to be an elieCr
tive leader throughout his political
career Leadership is an essential
quality for a president to be eifeCr
tive in governing this diverse nar
tion. Senator Bob Dole has given
strong evidence of his leadership
capabilities ever since his 1950
election to Congress and his 1963
election to the U.S. Senate. Dole
has led the light for such programs
as tax reform and a balanced
budget amendment. and is the
senior Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee and the Senate
Agriculture Committee. Many
voters already realize Dole's con
siderable leadership capabilities
7 he leads George Bush in the
polls on this question. No other
candidate can boast oi more ex
perience in positions oi leadership
than Bob Dole.

Experience is another in
valuable attribute which Bob Dole
would bring to the presidency,
Dole has had considerable ex»
perience working with Congress
during the past seven years as the
Republican leader in the Senate,
AS president. he will benefit irom
this experience as he attempts to
work with the Congress to get his
programs passed. Neither Jimmy
Carter nor Ronald Reagan was ex-
perienced in working with Con-
gress belore being elected presir
dent 7 Bob Dole Could use this ad
vantage to make relations
smoother between the executive
and legislative branches A major
priority ior Dole is reduction or the
budget deﬁcit, and he would be
able to work with Congress to
reduce spending and whittle down
the deﬁcit. On these and other
issues, Dole would be able to work
with, not necessarily against. his
iormer colleagues

A iinal attribute which deserves
mention is Bob Dale's electabillty,
Among the Republican candidates
running, more Democrats would
choose Dole than any other can-
didate, This finding indicates there
is substantial Democratic support
for Bob Dole. and that Democrats
don't consider him to be “just
another Republican." In the
general election, many dissatisiied
Democrats may turn to Dole as
their candidate. This point is imr
portant not only ior Republicans
who want a Republican president,
but also ior Democrats who may
consider supporting Bob Dole
because other iellow Democrats
support hiln Whichever political
party you support. you should cou-
sidcr the qualiiications Bob Dole
possesses to be president, and then
give him serious consideration as a
Candidate worthy oi your support
In Iowa on February 3

dent Bush is clearly uie most well»
prepared candidate in many years.
i supported George Bush in 1980
and am pleased that he was able to
serve as vice president. I'm conr
vinced that his participation the
last eight years has made a signiii-
cant diiierencc to the strategic
view oi thennited States. in the
last eight years great changes
have come about in the way the.
United states relates to other coun-
tries. Liberallzing iniluences in
countries as diverse as the Philip-
pines and Haiti, although not
perfect, are tremendous lm'
provements over what existed
earlier, Recent movements to
return Cuban troops trom Atrica
back to Cuba, a moderation in
Nicaragua, and expressions bi
Russian movement out oi
Afghanistan all indicate the
policies oi our government have
assisted millions oi people in many
countries to throw on the yokes or
both right-wing dictatorships and
communist totalitarian govern»
ments

George Bush has served all oihis I
liie as a committed American,I
From the time he enlisted in the |
United States Navy on his llith hire |
thday and served aggressively in
World War 11 as a combat pilot,
through his other civic com»
mitments as a member or Can I
grcss, ambassador to the United
Nations. and especially as the iirst
American government represen-
tative to the People's Republic oi I
China, George Bush has devoted |
his lite to the service oi his coun- I
try. I

As a businessman myseli, I can I
admire his Zﬂryear Career in inter I
national oil iield development, and I
recognize that this work also I
prepared him tor reacting and in- I
teractlng with people irom many
countries, both private persons
and governments.

in his work as director oi the
Central intelligence Agency,
George Bush not only became
knowledgeable about the inner
workings or our government and
its intelligence gathering opera-
tions abroad, but also became in»
timately aware oi the actions oi
other governments.

Most oi the political candidates
in the caucuses Monday night have
ambitious platiorms ior America.
None oi them have the years oi ex
perience, the breadth oi understan-
ding oi international relations, or
the sense oi balance that George
Bush brings to the process

students to attend their precinct

Unlike the candidates running
ior president, only Pete du Pont
has speciiieally addressed the
challenging issues that are beiore
this country. Pete does not believe
'in telling people what they want to
hear just to get votes; otherwise,
he would not come to Iowa and tell
iarmers that ii elected, he would
end their {arm subSidies, ii Pete
cared more about votes than
issues. he would not go into New
Hampshire and tell able-bodied
weliare recipients the it they don't
work. they‘don’t get paid,

Pete has based his entire canr
didacy on oiiering solutions to pro
blems, some of which are political-
ly sensitive issues, so sensitive, in
tact, that the other candidates are
afraid even to address them. Only
Pete du Pont is oiiering a way to
head off the inevitable Social
Security crisis. Other candidates
have denied that there is a pro
blem, or worse, have tried to pro-
mise all things to all people. Pete
has studied the problem and has
come up with a way to insure that
Social Security will be there (or
everyone without the need for rais-
ing taxes or cutting beneﬁts, thus
enabling the Social Security
system to withstand the crunch oi
the baby-boom generation.

While other candidates have
talked oi continuing the war oi
drugs, only Pete du Pont has lair
l'ered a viable way to deal with
drugs in schools. In this country,
we have a special responsibility to
people under lb. Pete has proposed
that instead of telling teenagers to

reason ior saying no is the lossvol
one's driver’s license. Studean

will be randomly tested ior drug
use. it the test is positive. parents
will be notified, and the student
will be enrolled in a drug counsel-
ing program. Driving privileges
will also be denied ior two years,
While other candidates are simply
agreeing that there is a drug pro-
blem in this country, only Pete du
Pont is oiiering a way to deal With
that problem.

The election of 1538 will set the
course of this nation tor the next
century What Americans must
decide is whether they want as
their leader a president who otters
only a resume or a voting record
and no vision, or a president who
will lead this country, a president
who has not been afraid to spell out
what he will do as president. The
vice president, the senator. the
congressman, the general, or the
preacher will be fine it you are
satisfied with how things are to-
day. But ii you want someone who
is the alternative to old ideas and
stale promises, Pete du Pont is the
only choice, 01’ all the candidates
running, only Pete du Pont has had
the courage to lay his proposals on
the table. This Monday, you will
have the opportunity to send a
clear message to the rest oi this
country. it you think things are
iine just as they are, you don’t
want to support Pete du Font. But
it you want a president who will
challenge you and lead this coun-
try and not just be a caretaker,
please vote ior Pete the night or
