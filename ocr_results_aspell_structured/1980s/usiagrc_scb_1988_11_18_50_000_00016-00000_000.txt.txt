Pioneers

building

a new tradition

by Bob Lifton

Their motto is "building a
new tradition." Now think about
that for a moment. It's not a
ﬁve-n—dime slogan which a coach
pulls together 'eause it sounded
good. Nor is it a catchrcall type
phrase which has the sole pur-
pose of attracting attention.
Rattler, it‘s coach Jeff Westlund's
"guiding statement" as it were for
his Grinnell College basketball
mun, now and in years to come.

This "tradition" started last
year when Westlund took over
what was for many years a direc-
tionless program. Did he "turn
them" into an instant "winner" in
just one year? Heavans not The
miracle worker would have passed
on that task assignment. More
importantly. what he did accom-
plish was put the basketball pro-
gram back on the ground -- with
its feet ﬁrmly pointed in the cor
reet direction

Winning only one game all
season, as last year‘s squad so
vividly remembers, is hardly a
call for a ticker-tape parade. Yet
anyone who was fortunate
enough to see the ever-husr
ding/give 110 percent Pioneers
on the coun knows full well that
this abysmal record is far from
accurate.

Eight of these games were
decided by seven points or less.
The Pioneers made a nasty habit
out of being close or even up
with but a couple of minutes re-
maining in the game, and leaving
the gym empty-handed. Why
this Achilles heel? Leadership,
pure and simple.

They were a very young

tee you that we play harder
than any team we play"

team -- many a night saw five
freshmen out on the Floor --
which had no one to turn to when
the game was on the line. This
season they're an entire year older
as a team. as a working unit
This vital experience produces
chemistry between players (guys
knowing where Lheir teammates
are movin' to before they make
their cut, kinda thing). something
which the coach knows is crucial
for success.

"The key." says Westlund,
"is how we develop as a team;
how we increase our chemistry

and really play together as one
unit . r . . Put simply, we want
to’ be the best we can be. We
want to improve each and every
day. That’s our number one goal.
If we can continually improve
every time we get on the court,
be it practice or a game, we'll be
in a much better position to
overcome any adversity which
comes our way." ‘

You really get a sense of
excitement just hearing the
coach’s words, He's dying to get
this season underway. Such en-
thusiasm may initially seem
premature at best for a coach
whose team ﬁnished in the cellar
last year But after listening to
Westlund, you quickly realize
that he's not trying to write an
overnight success story here
He‘s building a program, which
takes patience and steadfast dedi-
cation, but the end results will
invariably be well worth the
wait

"We're building a program
here right from the basics. We're
teaching these kids not only how
to play the game of basketball:
we're teaching them about
important values and principles
which they can apply to their
lives They're learning that's it's
essential to play for themselves.
notjust for the wins and losses."

Now don't go taking this
philosophy with a grain of salt.
It's a sound theory which is par-
ticularly relevant to athletics, re-
gardless of the sport at hand
Basketball doesn't end after a
game or at the conclusion of a
practice. A general feeling of
team unity must exist if a legit-
imate program is to be estab-
lished Such an atmosphere is
alive and kicking here at Grin-
nell.

Runners Thorburn and Evans
advance to NCAA nationals

by Bob Lifton
Last Saturday, freshman
Christine Thorburn and senior
Greg Evans both qualified for the
NCAA Division III national
championship, which will be
held in St. Louis tomorrow.
Thorburn qualified for the presti-
gious meet by placing 14th at
regionals. Enhancing this feet is
the uncanny fact that Thorburn
had the flu all week. She was ill,
the course was slick, and yet she
still managed to qualify,
Nationals may prove to be cake
compared to those lessrthan-fa-
vorable conditions.
The remaining members of
the women's cross country team
pulled in a 13th place finish.

This greatly pleased coach Evelyn
Freeman, as it represents a
marked increase over last year's
l8th place showing.

Evans achieved his year
long goal of making nationals by
finishing 12th at regiorials.
Last season he was one man shy
of qualifying. so he deﬁnitely had
a particular score to settle with
himself this yearl The rest of the
Purple Roos, which had to ﬁnish
fourth if they were to join Evans
in Mo., could only manage a
sixth place ﬁnish. Coach Will
Freeman noted that Evans has a
serious chance to receive All-
American honors by placing in
the top 25 tomorrow.

Women hoopsters
prepare for
opening game

. by Bill Collins

Coach Tod Eskildsen is known
for saying “We're gonna be at
right" on oteasinn, but this
years women‘s bnshetbnll team
will be more than just alright.
The team looks to improve upon
its 5-17 overall record from last
year and continue the improve-
ment which helped them gain
victories in four out of their last
ﬁve games in the 87’-88’ cam—
pnign.

The team will be lead by car
captains Jessica Taft and Amy
Johnson. both players have
made improvements in kev ar-
eas since last. yenr. Jessica is the
only reLtltling senior on a young
but experienred squad. She will
handle the point and provide the
team with leadership and gltidr
once through the roughest or
times. Amy will provide solid
dcft‘nsitle support by continuing
to do n sumssrul job against
opponents top scorers. The
team will look for strong inside
play and some offensive “pop"
from renter littura VanSickle, n
6'2“ junior from Lee's Summit,
Mo., who averaged 21.7 points
per game. This scoring out—
put ranked Lnurn ﬁlth aluollg
NCAA Division III athletes na-
tiollally.

The 88‘-89' hoopsters will be'
able to go murh deeper in their
brllth than previous Grinnell
teams and "Coach PL", as he is
affectionately called, sees this as
one or the keys to the success
thnt the team will enjoy. lie
plans to make numerous substi-
lulions and wear the opponent
down with the number of bad-
its thnl he is capable of using.
According to Coach Eskildsen,
time will be “learns tlrnt have
at better starting ﬁve, but none
will match our fourteen. We will
be relentless in our persistence."

strong defensive play will also
play a mny'nr role in the suc-
cess that the Pioneers will enr
joy. Putting intense prcssllrc on

the ball and playing the pass
ing lanes will be the teams spe-
cialfy. But we should not be
supriscrl to see full court press-
ing. This is where hnving a deep
bench is such an asset. All oftlle

team members have the speed
and mental capability to play
superb defense. Using extreme
intelligence in shifting defenses
will provide the opponent with
nurdr to think about. And there
is no doubt that the Pioneers
rail win any game in whirh they
can properly disguise their de-
fenses.

What's

The 1988 NCAA college font-
