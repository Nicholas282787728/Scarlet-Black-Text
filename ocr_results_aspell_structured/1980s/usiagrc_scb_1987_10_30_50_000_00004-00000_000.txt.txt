Art review
ignoranee,
sensmvlty

To the Editor:

This Letter to the Editor is a
response to “Berger Rellects on
Exhibit" in the October 9 issue oi
the Scarlet and Black.

You know, i hate to present my
case like the UltrarRadiCal (An-
dres Dworkinm feminists that
many oi us are, and I suppose
there are much more pressing
issues to deliberate about, but
nevertheless: Brian Berger's In-
sensitivity (to put it mildlyl in
reilecting on the current Burling
Gallery art exhibit is unaccep-
table, by my standards and those
of others i have spoken to, I
thought that Mr. Berger trivialized
the exhibit both in his opening and
closing remarks tmuch oi which
was not relevant to the articlel and
in his discussion of various pieces.
1 cannot remember anyone writing
with such casual negligence about
an exhibit in my past iour years at
Grinnell, so why start this
nonsense HOW”

First, if Mr. Berger "has a clue"
about art, he certainly does not
show it in the article. Mr. Berger, I
appreciate that you‘llumbled
yourseli by reciting your newly-
learned Art mi terms (composi-
tion, color. etcl, but your sell:
coniessed ignorance does NOT
give you a license to blow oil about
the exhibit as you wish. which in
cludes passing oil the works in
briei and often degrading descrip
tion “Huge and grotesque
vagi al area,” you say? Then
remember also the proverb,

criticized:
lack of
cited

“Beauty is in the Eye of the
beholder " Theretorc, Mr, Berger,
I iind you at [unit not yust with your
ignorance and insensttivity, but
also in your failure to demonstrate
that you were conscious or your
perspective as a man speaking
about art done by women OI
woman You do not speak for us all
tmen or woment. Mr. Berger. Did
you not have the respect to
recognize this?

Finally, not only do 1 disagree
with many of your comments, I
would hardly liken some of them to
“description." For instance, here
is one example which encompasses
your carelessness, insensitivity,
and tooh, can i say it?) subtle
misogyny, to say nothing oi your
ineliectual descriptives:

“Imogen Cunningham 7 some
picture oi Gertrude Stein No big-
gee. The picture that is 7 Gertrude
herseli is looking pretty heity.”

Yo Brian, dude, pretty funny
hey? Mr. Berger, I doubt if you
enlighten anyone with such com-
ments, so WHY PRINT THEM?
Could you think oi nothing
more/else to write? is

‘your
, perspective really so shallow

One last note' This letter to the
Editor does not oppose critical
reveiws of exhibits. but the mind-
set oi those who can thoughtlessly
and disrespectfully devalue them.
Mr. Berger, I encourage you to
wake up, smell the collee. and ex
pand your horizons a bit 7 Dean-
nn uicklord.

Student ‘disgusted’
by Berger‘s reviews

To the Editor:

I would like to express my
disgust with the recent articles by
Mr. Brian bergcr. Normally i am
reticent concerning the quality of
writing in the S and B, but Mr.
berger has finally moved me to air
my disapproval. His offensive.
"Cool” style or writing does not
belong in a supposedlyvcsteemed
college publication such as thc
Scarlet and Black, as its inclusion
hurts the overall perception of thc
paper when read by students as
well as their parents and members
oi the community. 1 reier
speciiically to the two articles,
written by Berger in the October 9
issue, concerning the film
"Manhattan" and the women's art
exhibit in Burling Library

1 tail, to understand \ihy a movie
review must degenerate into a plug
for New York City 1 resent
Berger's assertion that "you'll
never ever have a ‘Chicago’ or
'Cleveland' because the people
aren't there and the history isn't
there," which lirst oi all has no
place in a review oi a film and
which, secondly, dismisses two
magnilicent cities, The most upset»
ting element oi Berger's writing,
however. is his “cool" language 1
do not want to hear about relation
ships being “a pain in the ass‘,"
similarly, i do not wish to be told
thata lilm “kicks major ass." I am
not sure what a “hepcat” is, but I
can tell that somehow berger
thinks that he is one in the end it

SGA Briefs:

turns out that Mr. Hepcat spends
more time piling praise on New
York City than he does luliilling his
movie review assignment.

Next, Berger takes us on a tour
oi the women's art exhibit in burl
ing He is truly a wonderiul tour
guide: "Y0 G-men and women. get
yourscli down to the Burling
library...“ I feel that i know much
more about this exhibit alter being
told about the “Cool-ass green" in
June Wayne's work and the “rad
woodcut” by Mary Mullineux. i
believe that this kind oi ”review”
should have never been printed
because the reader gains no
valuable information from it and is
more likely annoyed by its un-
proiessional style and use of
language, not to mention its often
sive nature.

Though I am as upset as anyone
over the streamlining of this col-
lege’s image as a whole, 1 hope
that in the iuture the Scarlet and
Black will strive to accomplish a
polished and proiessional look that
reilects iavorably upon all oi the
members oi the Grinnell College
Community. it will tail in this
endeavor, though, until it ceases to
print articles oi this low quality. At
that point, perhaps tto use
Berger's words) “It will bring
some much needed ‘preslige' to
this stagnant and indecisive. in-
stilution.” — Thomas A. Beverly
