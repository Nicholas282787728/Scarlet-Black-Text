14 October 1983

Ronald Reagan: Cerminly, President
Reagan's ‘Battleship Conservative' has
been a nightmare for liberal America,
Reagan has kept us in the dark about his
intentions for 1984, but it seems that every
newspaper and magazine in the country
has predicted that he will seek rec
nomination. Reagan should, by all ac-
counts, have no problem receiving the
Republican nomination, but he is going to
have problems winning reelection.

Reagan is significantly behind all
Democritic candidates in polls of three
minority groups — women, Blacks and
Hispanics — and rightfully so, Reagan, his
staff, and his cabinet have continually inv
sulted women and Black Americans But
his infamous popularity with these groups
stems even more from his economic
policies. Yes, the economy has shown
signs of turning around, but has not been
optimistic for the us. poor. if the
economy is turning around, then the poor
should be benefiting from ‘trickle down‘.
but this year, tor the first time since 1965,
there was an increase in the percentage of
population that lives below the poverty
level. The percentages increased most
among Blacks and Hispanics, this rise
comes with stricter poverty guidelines.
Malnutrition, which should ultimately
decline in advanced industrial societies,
has also risen. Although this cannot
necessarily be attributed to Reaganomics,
cuts in food stamps and school lunches
must share some of the blame, Because
women, Blacks, and Hispanics make up 50
percent of the voting population, Reagan
may be in some trouble here.

Besides his economic policies, which
have brought a near 200 billion dollar
deficit (from the candidate that wants a
balanced budget amendment) and record
unemployment, no liberal can forgive his
defense policy, especially when it comes at
the expense of social programs. Reagan
has continually supported the MX missile
and the drilling of 2000 more holes in the
U.s. to obtain a shell game bargaining
chip. He has stammered on the issue of the
nuclear freeze, which polls show 65 per-

- cent of the U.S. public supports.

Reagan, or should we say Secretary oi
Interior James Watt, has begun his master
plan or leasing federal lands to corporate
exploitation; Reagan here, though, did
have a mandate from the American peo-
ple. Reagan has also supported, although
not with much success so far, an anti-
abortion amendment, prayer in schools,
and the infamous Family Act,

George Bush: If, with any luck, Reagan
should chose to bow out of the 1984 race,
many believe that his secondrplace
finisher in 1980, Vice Presxdent Bush,
Would stand the best chance of receiving
the Republican nomination: Certainly,

Scarlet & Black

Political primer (part 2)

A liberal review of the candidates

Bush would be better than Reagan, but a
Bush candidacy presents some problems.
We have not really heard much from Bush,
because he must wait in the rafters until
Ronnie makes up his mind, so any evalua-
tion must stem for his ‘30 rhetoric

Bush presented himself in 1980 as a
moderate choice for the Republican Party,
and certainly he was more moderate than
Reagan. At that time, Bush spoke of
Reagan‘s economic policies as “VooDoo
Economics." but that all predictably iaded
away. One wonders whether Bush will
campaign on the excesses of the Reagan
Defense Budget. Bush, has, in the past,
made some frightening statements about
war. in 1950 he suggested the possibility of
winning a limited nuclear war. This kind of
logic is scary, to say the least, Bush has
also strongly supported Reagan's irontal
to the freeze movement, but we cannot
predict his own policies outside the cone
lines oi the White House

One hopes that if Bush does become a
serious candidate he will forsake the exte »
mities of Reaganism and return to his
more moderate course.

Alan Cranston

Hart: Who ran George McGovern's
notorious 1972 campaign, is trying to ap-
peal to voters with “New Liberalism."
"New Liberalism" is fundamentally the
Same as traditional liberalism. although
Hart emphasizes the changing focus or the
US economy and the necessity of creative
leadership to handle the shift. He feels the
government should help facilitate the shift
from heavy industry to hi-tech products by
targeting key industries for growth and by
helping to retrain workers who are
displaced by the new market conditions.

Hart is not outspoken on foreign policy
issues, aluiough he believes the military
budget needs to emphasize reliable, con-
ventional weaponry rather than
technologically complex material that
does not work,

Hart is admirably trying to orient the
campaign more toward issues than per-
sonalities; uniortunately, his support may
evaporate completely before he succeeds

Alan Cranston: Senator Alan Cranston
has been a prominent Democratic leader
for more than 20 years, and his record as
California‘s Senator speaks ior itself,
Cranston’s chances are not good in the
Democratic race, which seems to be
dominated by Mondale and Glenn, His
chances oi forming a iar-leit coalition are
slim with the split of the iar-leit between
Gary Hart and himself and the new can-
didancy oi George McGovern, cranslon is
thus iar the leading far-left liberals, and if
the battle between Mondale and Glenn
leaves too many scars, Cranston could
receive the Vice-Presidential nomination,

Cranston has centered his campaign on
the issue of the nuclear freeze. Cranston
has been Congress most avid supporter oi
the ireeze, He has also promised big cuts
in the defense budget. Although Cranston
does dabble in the idealistic world a bit
much, he has more than any other can
didate made the horror of nuclear war a
major issue

Cranston has continually voted against
Reagan’s budget cuts in social programs
and has committed himself to greater fun-
ding in education, His rhetoric about
Reaganomics is along the old Democratic
line, but Cranston is not a spend-thrift
liberal and does not believe that throwing
money at problems solves them With the
main thrust at his campaign being the
freeze, Cranston has not offered concrete
solutions to the ravages of Reagan; his
candidacy will, however, push the nuclear
freeze onto the Democratic Platform,

Walter Mondale: Currently the top

choice among Democrats; he represens '

familiarity, experience and-consistency.
People associate Mondale with the
mainstream liberalism of his mentorv
Hubert Humphrey. He is a longtime ally
oi organized labor and received the
valuable endorsements of the AFL-CIO
and the National Education Association
last week. Mondale is also popular among
Black and Jewish groups because of his
consistent support of civil rights legisla»
tion when he served in the Senate. Mondale
has been criticized on the grounds that he
represents nothing more than an
amalgamation of these and other special
interest groups. Such criticism begs the
question: what is a frank and file"
Democrat, if not a member of some in-
terest group? Moreover, Mondale's record
reveals greater consistency than is usually
associated with politicians who cater ex-
clusively to special interest groups
Another common criticism is that Mon-
dale is consistent to the point of being
predictable 7 even boring. Many believe
he lacks the charisma necessary to defeat
President Reagan, Most people who have
heard him speak, however, agree that his
reputation is largely undeserved. Further-

more, his popularity with special interests
should be viewed as a strength — Mondale
has the potential to uniiy the diverse
democratic constituencies.

John Glenn: Senator and former
astronaut from Ohio, hopes that the use of
a flashy media blitz will give him an ad
vantage over the lower»key Mondale, who
now has decided organizational superiorir
ty. Eventually, their idealogical dif-
ferences will overshadow superficial dif-
ferences oi style; Glenn is challenging
Mondale from the conservative wing of the
party, Some argue that Glenn issimply too
conservative even to be called a Democr-
at. i-ie consistently supports Reagan's in-
creases in the military budget and even
sided with the President on the controverv
sial nervergas vote last summer in the
Senate. He also supported Reagan‘s
sweeping tax and budget cuts in 1981.

Glenn's popularity among independent
voters in the polls aids his popularity
within his party because many feel that he,
rather than Mondale, can defeat Reagan
This aspect oi the race merits attention,
because some Democrats are so obsessed
with beating Reagan that they ivill accept
Glenn even if it requires sacrificing their
traditionally liberal stands on issues like
arms control,

As of now Glenn has offered few clues
about how conservative his campaign will
be; for the time being, he seems content to
see how far his hero image. which is
reminiscent of lke Eisenhower, will carry
him in the early months. when Glenn does
reveal what he stands for, many
Democrats may not like what they hear.

The campaign oi Colorado Senator Gary
Hart is in deep trouble, His organization is
heavilyjn debt, More critically. after nine
months of campaigning he consistently
rates less than 5 percent in straw votes and
polls against the democratic competition,
Alan Cranston’s entrance into the race has
divided liberal support to some extent and
many people seem to be writing off all oi
the candidates except Mondale and Glenn,

Walter Mondale
