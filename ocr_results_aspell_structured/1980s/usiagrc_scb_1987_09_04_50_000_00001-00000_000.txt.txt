There have been iew phenomena
in recent years which have
galvanized the world’s attention as
has Acquired Immune Deﬁciency
Syndrome (AIDS). This fatal,
usually sexually transmitted
disease has decimated the
homosexual and lV—drug-user
populations and now increasingly
threatens heterosexuals, too.

Iowa, where most cases have
been among gay and bisexual men
living in Des Moines, has yet to see
the full impact of the disease,
While Iowa's 69 AIDS cases rank it
a lowly 36th (both iigures supplied
by the Iowa Department oi Health
and accurate as of August 27, 1987}

Gray, in conjunction with the
Central Iowa AIDS Coalition
(CIAC) and the American Red
Cross, conducts ”Community Sup-

ple with AlDS (PWAS) and ior
volunteers interested in altering
counseling or other assistance ser-
vices to PWAs. He says that he
iirst became interested in working
with AiDS services in 1933 when a
smattering oi AIDS cases were
reported in Iowa.

himself more about the disease
and its ramifications, In December
of 1985, he contacted the Shanti
Project in San Francisco, one ol
the iirst groups to inaugurate emo
tional and community-support
training for PWAs, and he has
since made iour trips to its head
quarters at San Francisco General
Hospital.

Despite lowa's comparatively
small number oi cases, Gray
warns that the Health Department
might be iorced to ”play
Catchsup,” to improve and aug-
ment its facilities for PWAS more
rapidly as the disease spreads.
“We only have sgcases now, but
are we going to wait until we get
600 before we start doing anything
about cducating people? Weshould
have a policy or prevention
through education," he says.

Gray believes that American
society's puritanical attitude
toward sexuality, particularly the
stigma long associated with
homosexuality, has impaired elr
forts to educate the public about
the transmission of AIDS

“We still can't talk about sexual
1y transmitted diseases and cons
traception. It took us six years to
get condom ads on television. This
government could be sued Ior
manslaughter," asserts Gray.

He does think, however, that
AIDS has forced the American
public to address once off-limit
issues such as homosexuality, IVr
drug use, and the spread of the

disease among the homeless,
“Ga disease"

Another obstacle to education
has been the attitude that AIDS is

bored many oi the same tears and
was alarmed alter accidentally
sticking himseli with a needle he
had used to inject a PWA. "I got
really scared that I had contracted
the virus, and I started thinking
that I might die.”

Realizing that his fears were lrr
rational, Gray decided to educate

”already .enough” inlormation
‘about AIDS available to the public.
“We have to continually show the
public what this disease is," says
Gray. “People might go to a lecs

understand it. They get out In the

ing about what's ior dinner."

Speakers
dispute
Chinese
proposal

by Dave Jones
“By accepting the concept oi
‘one country, two systems,’
[Taiwan] can realize reunification
and at the same time they can lead
their normal life." said Li Wang,
political counselor ol' the embassy
oi the People’s Republic or China
Wang was one oi several speakers
at Grinnell’s ”Reunification of
China" conference this Week.
Presenting the Chinese stand on
reunification, Wang explained
China‘s proposed “one country,
two Systems” plan, which would
bring together socialist mainland
China with capitalist Taiwan, In an
interview with the Scarlet and
Black, Wang cited a recent poll oi
Taiwanese in which over 70 per-
cent were opposed to independence,
“The Taiwan people also desire to
have the reunification, Most of the
people there are urdently in iavor
of such an outcome," he Said.
While Wang’s claim that Taiwan
is in Iavor oi reunification is iaii-ly
accepted, the merits oi the pro-
posal are highly disputed Byron
Wang of the Chinese University of
Hong Kong argues that not only
are the Taiwanese not in iavor of

the proposal, but also the term
“one country, two systems” is
misleading. “The concept itself
does not mean, as the words imply,
that there will simply be one coun-
try with two equal systems, It's a
device in which there is a central
government which allows a small
place to have autonomy, It is an
unequal situation," said Weng.
Hong Kong, where Weng
teaches, will enter into the “one
country, two systems" agreement
when it changes irom British to
Chinese control in 1997. Weng,
however. is quick to point out that
Hong Kong's and Taiwan's en»
trances are very ditierent matters,

Computer
thefts

by Stephen Hardwick

Early Thursday morning,
August 27, three VT 220 terminals
and two LA so printers were stolen
irom the Loose computer room,
Computer Services estimates the
value oi the stolen equipment at
53,200.

The Grinnell Police Department
is not sure that the thiel is a stu
dent. According to Sergeant Doug
Shutts oi the police department,
“We've got some leads that lead to
college students,” but he cautions
that the police have other leads
that indicate that the thiei might
not be a student, Shutts added that
although the police still had a
number oi leads to check, “We
may be closer than we think.”

Computer Services plans to
replace the stolen computers but
has yet to determine irom where
the replacements will come. It has
not been determined when the
replacements will arrive in Loose.
“They'll be replaced ior sure,”
said .lean Kinnaird oi Computer
Services, ”but how, I don't know.”
As oi Wednesday there were only
two VT 220 terminals in the Loose
computer room,

Computer Services generally
secures the computers to prevent
thett, but the stolen equipment had
been installed the previous day and
had not been secured.

According to the Grinnell Police
Department, the perpetrators, ii
convicted, face up to lo years in
prison, a $5,000 tine, or both, ior

Reuniﬁcation conference

Harding calls
for flexibility

by Dave Jones

Harry Harding, senior iellow at
the Brookings institute, was on
campus this past week ior the
Reunification of China conference.
Harding, an expert on China, spoke
with the Scarlet and Black about
the conference as well as about the
role of research institutions in the
U.S, The following is a text of that
interview.

Scarlet and Black
what expectations do you have
Ior this conference?

Harry Harding

It's useiul ior me to hear people
like the political counselor irom
the Chinese Embassy retlecting
the Chinese government's position
and Hungdah Chiu who can. at
least unoiiicially, reilect the
Taiwanese perspective.

Scar-lot and Black
What sort oi implications does
the “one country, two systems”

proposal have ior the US?

Harding

1 think this issue was, in the
19505, one oi the most explosive
issues in American relations. Since
then the situation has diliused con»
siderably, with Taiwan re
maining the most important
obstacle in U.S.7China relations.

0n the other hand, I don’t think
the Taiwan question is an issue
that the U.S. can resolve . . We
learned the hard way in no 19405
that the US. is not very well
prepared to mediate a Chinese
civil war.

Scarlet and Black
What is your own feeling about
the Chinese proposal?

Harding

I think that this is a very ilcxible
proposal. 0n the other hand, I
think there are some very serious
