Soccer, volleyball i.v.'s bow in
competition but show promise

by Jeff Raymond

Two Grinnell junior varsity teams com»
peted here during the past week and a
thi j.v. team had a contat scheduled but
their opponent was unable to ﬁeld a team.
Unfortunately, both the soccer and
volleyball teams lost their junior contests.
The football game against Knox was called
off when Knox could find only nine players.

The soccer junior varsity played a varsi-
ty contingent from Maharishi Interna-
tional University last Saturday and came
away with a 24) loss despite several good
effork by the team.

Coached primarily by Greg Donovan,
the varsity squad's goalie, and captained
by Junior Paul Furth, the young team was
competing in its first game together.
Maharishi was playing in its third contest
of the season and was able to work
together somehwat better than the Grin-
nell squad.

Sophomore Raffael stein, playing on the
j.v. for his second year, noted that the
average age of the team’s players has
dropped by at least one year because
many more lreshrnen have expressed a
serious interest in playing, He said that a
lack of team spirit on the squad may be
due in part to the disappointment of the
trosh of not making tile varsity, but that
the team should get closer with more ex»
perience and road games.

stein did say, drough, that those people
who have come out for either varsity or
junior varsity are, on the whole, more
serious about ureir soccer playing.

One of those freshmen who ended up on
the junior squad, Mike Wallace, stated
that he did not expect to make the varsity
right away and was satisfied with his role
on the j.v.

Wallace did allow, however, that he will
probably be tempted to give up playing
soccer if he does not make the varsity
squad after two years on the junior team.
He said that he felt that it could be difficult
to move up soon because the team is larger
ly studentrun during game conditions,
with Coach John Pfitsch standing aside let-

 

 

ting Donovan and Furth assume com-
mand.

The junior varsity squad was forced to
find several new opponents this year
because the team became involved in
several lights last year. A player on last
year‘s team claimed that dirty tactics by
opponents led to the altercations and in
order to avoid such incidents this year,
Pfitsch had to schedule alternate teams.

The team’s next game will be tomorrow
against the University of Northern Iowa
soccer club, following the varsity contest.

The volleyball junior varsity squared off
against a collection of players lrom

'Ellsworth Community College, including

several who would later compete against
the Grinnell varsity, last Tuesday night.

The j.v. bowed to Ellsworth but did {air-
ly well by scoring 11 and then in points in
two games. The varsity squad later fell to
nearly the same Ellsworth team in four
games.

Junior Varsity Team Captain Sueann
Dahm said that she was pleased with the
way the team played and said that the
1541, 15-10 losses were an improvement
over their only prior match, which was
also against Ellsworth. Since the team
does not scrimmage much, according to
Dahm, it is hard to tell how much improve-
ment the team is making between games.

Unlike the soccer j.v., the volleyball
squads are split up frequently in practice
because the volleyball teams use different
defenses. The soccer teams generauy
practice together.

There is also a great deal more faculty
supervision and structure to the volleyball
j.v., which is headed by Coach Sarah
Brichford, than is the case with the soccer
team. Dahm said that her duties as cap-
tain do not include much more than
representing the team at the coin toss.
whereas Ruth and Donovan are free to
run the team more and can even make
player replacements when necessary.

The volleyball teams will play against
Knox tonight in the PE, .

Wednesday for a return game with Nor—
them Iowa. The Pioneers finally opened
their season last Wednesday, dropping a
4-3 home encounter to Northern Iowa.

“We played a super first half,” said new
Coach Cathie Schweitwr. “We were too
conservative in the second half, concen-
trated more on defense than offense, and
let Northern Iowa push the ball up the
field.”

The Scarlet and Black notched all three
of their goals in the opening stanza and on»
joyed a 3-1 lead at the intermission. Carol
Cadby scored the first tally unassisted.

On Saturday, Grinnell dropped a 4-0
decision at Iowa Wesleyan. “We arrived
late, didn‘t have sullicient time to get
warmed up in the cold weather, and were
not prepared to play physicauy or mental-
ly," Schweitzer stated. She cited goalie
Emily Scudder for performing well while
under a lot of pressure. Scudder was
credited with 14 saves.
