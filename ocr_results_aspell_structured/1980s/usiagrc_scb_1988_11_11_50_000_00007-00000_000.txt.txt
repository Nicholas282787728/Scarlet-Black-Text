Roxanne: entertaining throughout

by Brian Strause

The story has been done
before, but never so hilariously
as in Roxanne. Even the Brady
Bunch episode in which Greg
helps Peter sweet-talk a volup-
tuous teeny-hopper fails to cap-
ture the humor that Steve Martin
propels in Roxanne. The story is
based on Cyrano dc Bergerac and
is set in an out of the way ski
town. The community is taken
by surprise when as-
tronomer/goddess Roxanne (Daryl
Hannah) comes to town to study
the stars. Everyone immediately
falls for her. including 0D,
(Steve Martin), but he hangs
back because his nose gets in the
way. Nonetheless, it should be
noted that he can still “satisfy
two women at the same time."
New fireman and town hunk,
Chris. gets Roxanne's wheels
turning. However, Chris' IQ ri»
vals the number of stars you can
see at high-noon, which Lends to

cause an intellectual barrier with
the brainy Roxanne. The result of
a rare brain drizzle, Chris man-
ages to recruit CD, to do the
thinking for him and the ﬁre-
works begin. However, lapses in
communication often leave Chris
attempting at his own brand of
romanticism: "Hey, weren't you
the centerfold for the April issue
of Playboy?"

Entertaining throughout,
Steve Martin has written the per-
fect screenplay to display his tal-
ents. Martin's prowess at physi-
cal humor, stand-up comedy. and
surrealism are all displayed with
an underlying genius, Roxanne
represents Martin's greatest ac~
Complishmcnt in his career and
will certainly take its place as
one of the greatest comedies of
all time.

To Live and Die in LA: MTV and
Miami Vice hit the big screen

by Dan Capone

William Fricdkin's To Live
and Die in LA, taken from Gerald
Pctievich's novel, gives us the
usual good guy/bad guy,
cop/robber plot. In something
straight out of Miami Vice, a
cop, motivated by deep-felt re-
venge, puts himself above the
law in seeing his slain partner's
killer killed. In this particular
case, our "hero" (William Pc-
tcrsen) is a Secret Service agent,
whose partner is killed just days
before his retirement in an at~
tempt at finally capturing a big-
time counterfeitcr. Petersen ﬁnds
his panner's body in a garbage
bag abuzz with ﬂies, and from
then on takes over the chase,
nothing standing in his way. By
this point, if you haven‘t figured
it out already, the rest of the
movie is like any other of the
genre; Friedkin cven borrows his
own car chase scene from The

Hopi Prophecy: U.S. government treatment
of Native Americans questioned

by Lisa Bedinger and Brian
Suause

A documentary produced by
a Japanese ﬁlm company in co-
operation with the Hopi, Hopi
Prophecy paints an unnerving
portrait of the contemporary
genocide of the American Indian,
The Japanese and the Hopi have a
lot more in common than one
might expect. Their bond arises
from the uranium that was mined
in the Four Corners Area (the re-
gion where the borders of Ari-
zona, New Mexico, Utah, and
Colorado meet), the same ura~
nium that went into manufactur-
ing the bombs dropped at Na-
gasaki and Hiroshima, Much of
the information translated in this
film has been isolated by the
US. government and largely
unpublicized by the American
media. Apparently. the American

public would rather ignore the
radioactive mess that festers in
the Four Corners Area than to
address the issue. In the mean»
time, the U.S. Government
wants to declare this region a
National Sacrifice Land. an area
unfit for human habitation

The nightmare of the ura-
nium mines has plagued the Hopi
since the mines' beginnings. The
Hopi knew from the tradition of
the prophecy that their land was a
powerful point on the earth‘s
surface, full of a sacred energy
that they were in charge of keepv
ing in check. This job became
impossible when the US Gov»
ernment took it upon itself to
rape the land of its power and use
the residue for the manufacture of
bombs. Who better to mine the

The Mission: It‘s hard to tell the
good guys from the bad

by Dave Jones

The Mission, set in the
jungle of 1750's South America.
is a somewhat rare ﬁlm in that it
is able to portray a struggle be-
tween good and evil which ends
up as a battle between evil and
evil-er.

The film tells the story of a
Jesuit priest, Father Gabriel, who
is sent to the jungle to "civilize"
an Indian village. He quickly re-
alizes, however, that he has more
to battle with than just the hea-
thcnism of thc natives. Rodrigo
Mendoza, a slave trader, comes to
the village with his marauding
Sidekicks and kidnaps several of
the villagers. Gabriel can do
nothing but stand by and watch
as they are taken away.

Another theme is added
later when Mendoza (Robert De
Niro), after killing his own
brother over a woman, joins
Gabriel's parish in order to re-
pent. Eventually, after punishing
himself to his heart’s content,
Mendoza starts on the path to
priesthood

When the Spanish come to
lake the village, the differences in
the backgrounds of Mendoza and
Gabriel show through. Gabriel
wants to use peace, love and the
cross to defeat the army. Men»

doza wants to blow their brains
out with a pistol. Slightly vary»
ing opinions, huh? In any event.
it makes for a nice little blood
both.

This ﬁlm Cost $22 million
to make, and it shows, Chris
Menges, the cinematographer,
deserves much praise for his
breathtaking shots of the jungles,
mountains and waterfalls which
make up the land. But the heart
of the movie revolves around
whether the Jesuits are helping
the Indians, or only breaking up
their native society.

Roland Jaffe (The Killing
Fields), who directed the film,
seems to try very hard to pitch
Father Gabriel (Jeremy Irons) as a
sensitive man whose only ambiv
lion in life is to help the Indians
ﬁnd God, and become Civilized. I
don't buy that. The church is in~
vading the Indian's culture, and

irrevocably altering it. And these
arc supposed to be the good guys.
All in all, The Mission is a
pretty good way to spend an
evening Sasha says "It's a must-
see." And we all know that Sasha
wouldn't steer us wrong.

uranium than the natives, who
wallowcd in poverty? Many
Hopi were virtually forced to
work in these mines where they
would inhale carcinogenic fumes
with little or no protection.
While the workers became in-
fested with radioactivity, the en-
vironment also became a seething
pit of nuclear waste. No ate
tempts were made to take care of
the nuclear waste. and it was al-
lowed to seep into the water table
while piles of mill railings
(radioactive dirt) were commonly
used as play areas for children.

Tragically, the Hopi had
prophesized the significance of
their homeland, looking upon the
earth as their mother, Their at-
tempts to keep their part of the
world in balance were drastically
altered by the uranium»hungry
U.S, government. Some of the
Hopi prophecies have already
come true, including the inven-
tion of the nuclear bomb. Many
more of the prophecies have yet
to surface, but only time can tell.
The significance of Hopi
Prophecy cannot be overstated.
Gripping, powerful, and generally
brilliant this ﬁlm transcends the
label "documentary" and should
be required viewing for the hu-
man taoe.
