was blowing out! That may be
true, but the Pioneer‘s home
opener wasn’t exactly a clinic in
team defense for either team.

Grinnell's defense, or lack
thereof, unfortunately made its
presence felt early In the first
game. The first inning was a
nightmare for righthander Dave
Steinmttn, as one unearned run
after another piled up, until the
home team was down six before
even coming to bat. If their hats

Softball advances
record to 5 - 2

by Laura Whiunore

Grinnell‘s softball team is off
and running with a 52 overall (1-
1 conference) record. Just to put
that in perspective, their record
last year was 2-9. a mark which
they surpassed after their first
three games this year. This past
week. the Pioneers split
doubleheaders with Upper Iowa
and Cornell.

Last Thursday, Grinnell
hosted their first home game
against Upper Iowa. In the first
halfof the doubleheader it was a
pitcher‘s dual, with both teams
remaining scoreless until the
seventh inning when Upper Iowa
pounded out five runs. Unable to
score, Grlnuell Stvallowed their
first loss.

The second game was a
different story. Grinnell took tltc
fetid 2- l and held it until Upper
Iowa 3 last at bat. In lltc se\enllt
inning, Upper Iowa scored two to
go up 3- 2 Undauntetl Grinnell
produced some of thelr own lust-
Inning firepower. capturing the
game 473 on Pam Frecxe's game-
winning RBI. Jennifer I'Iughes
also had a great day. getting three
hits, wllile pitchcr Mary
Allcnburg contributed two hits to
the win.

Saturday’s gatne against
conference foe Monmouth was
rained out, so the Pioneers got a
little breather before facing
Cornell for their first conference
game on Wednesday. Once again
the Pioneers split the dou-
bleheader. winning the first and
losing the second.

In the first game, Grinnell
went into the seventh Inning
with a 1-0 lead. Cornell then

Rugby: easy as 1, 2, try

by James Sadlcr

In a small college in England
during the mid-19th century. the
boys used to play soccer with the
local children for their daily exer-
cise. One day one of the locals
get into a dispute with one of the
college students. In a sign of
rebellion the poor lad picked up
Lhe soccer ball and ran with it,

As others joined into the
chase for the ball carrier, they
began to develop a new form of
soccer. Visitors who came to
this small school, named Rugby
College. marveled at the unique
form of futbol (soccer) which the
stutients played. Soon Rugby
began to spread to otller schools

By World War I the
populttrity of Rugby had grown
to mythical proportions, During
a ceasefire between the British
and Germans, for example, each
sale sent ollt 15 players who met
on the small battle ld between
the two Lrench lines. Here they
played ti game of Rugby to tile

delight of thousands of British
and German soldiers who cheered
their team on.

Today, Rugby is one of the
fastest-growing sports in the
United States. in addition to our

women’s club, Grinnell is one of
three colleges in Iowa that has its
own men's Rugby team. As
Rugby is foreign to many
Grinnell students, we (Grinnell
Griffins) feel obliged to give a
brief description of the game so
that fans may better enjoy the
action.

The match is played between
two teams of 15. Of these I5
players, nine are forwards and six
are backs. The object of the
game is to get the ball into the
opponents‘ by 1one (similiar to
the end-zone in football).

To s ore, the offense must
touch the ball down in the try
zone. This Constitutes a "try"

takes Sl title

by Bob Lifton

It was worth the wait, that‘s,
for sure, This victory will be
savored for quite a while.

Last evening "Live Skank
Fest" defeated "The Bitch
Magnets" 51-41 to capture the
much-coveted Special Interest
Basketball title. The victory was
all the sweeter as the team of
eight had gone four years with
superior records -- losing only
one regular season game in three
years -- yet coming up empty in
the playoffs. Not this year,
baby!

Four seniors: Luc Hatelstad.
Randy Seeley, Dan Sullivan and
Bob Lifton : and three juniors:

Chris Jones. Dave Gerard and
Matt Morcland compose the
undefeated squad. And in the
spirit and tradition ofeur team,
we will imbibe heavily. Cheers.
