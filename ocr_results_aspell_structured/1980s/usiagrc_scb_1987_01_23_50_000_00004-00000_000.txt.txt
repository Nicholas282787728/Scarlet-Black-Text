(or How Not to Starvein Japan)

by Lisa Grant

l-in studying abroad this year in Japan at
Waseda University. I thought others may
be interested in my experiences since most
Americans don't know much about normal
life in Japan. Most of what will follow are
my comments and perceptions. and
anyone who leels ditfereill is welcome to
respond,

Alter ﬁve months in Japan, living.
eating, and breathing everything
Japanese, I've come to the conclusion that
it’s not the most exotic and wellrknown
food that‘s weird The ordinary stuff that
one iinds in the refrigerator and cupboards
of every regular household. the basic
Ioodstuffs of life, are the surprises,

Most of my Japanese iriends look ex-
tremely surprised when they learn that l
do eat sushi and sashimi. The looks I get
when they hear that sushi is one of my
favorite foods are exquisite; and the [act
that I can drink sake blows them away.

I‘m lucley because my host
family eats eggs, toast,
and sausage, whereas a
regular fapanexe breakfast
is rice, seaweed, and raw

eggs mixed with rice.

“whatnot" hit the nail on the head: I
didn't recognize ANYTHING AT ALL.
Even the mayonnaise didn't look likc‘,

Learning to sublimate culturally im
printed eating habits and accept new ones
is part oi living abroad. And starving is a
remote possibility; there are many more
ioods that I like than I dislike, rempura

up lmuch to my host family's
amazement) Cupboards stocked with
munchies don't exist in Japan; shopping is
usually a daily chore,_and the Japanese
don‘t pig out, I guess

This‘ is not to say that snack foods don't
exist. That‘s what convenience stores like
7-11 are tor. And they're doing booming
business. too! However, Frito Lay’s and
Hershey‘s aren't part of the regular stock.
Cuttlefish- and shrimp-tlavored potato
snacks, rice crackers, huge assortments ot
Instant Ramen noodles, and rice balls
(O-nigirl) are all normal snacks,

instead oi popcorn, nikhoman (steamed
bread filled with meat, curry or bean-
paste) is sold. Hot dogs are replaced by ,
other things. Nimono, a Staple. includes
various types at Japanese stew in which —
pumpkin. carrots, bacon. vegetables.
black mushrooms and potatoes are cooked
{or long periods or time. Various vegetable
dishes as well as fried fish. baked fish. ant
ﬁsh soup, are necessities. as is the evel
nresent bowl of rice.

food that meets the palate at the local
Benihana or sushi bar. Getting used to it
and getting to like it are culinary adven-

part oi learning about Japan.
