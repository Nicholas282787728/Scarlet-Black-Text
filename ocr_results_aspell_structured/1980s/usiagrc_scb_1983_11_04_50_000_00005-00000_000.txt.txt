Policing public debate: The Pentagon v. pluralist politics

by Wes Joe

Last Monday, the Reagan Administra—
tion confirmed a report that U.S. forcu aCV
cidentally attacked a civilian hospital in
Grenada during the first day of iighting on
the Caribbean island. This information
silenced administration claims that no
civilian casualties had resulted from ﬁle
invasion. The hospital was severely
damaged and victims were buried under
the rubble. Although U.S. forces have con-
trolled the opposition fort near the hospital
area since two weeks ago Wednesday,
Pentagon officials did not send a report to
the White House until last Sunday night,
Some questions arise. Firstly, why did it
take the Pentagon so long to inform the Ad-
ministration of this accidental attack?
Secondly, a more general and perhaps
more important question arises: why does
the government insist on maintaining
strict control over the information
Greneda received by the American peo-

le'!

9 The press has repeatedly objected to the
strict control exerted by the Pentagon over
information related to the U.S. invasion of
Greneda. Angered by this “un-
precedented" restriction of their move
ment, members of the Amercian press
establishment lodged a formal complaint

' with the White House, They are a little
late, This government effort to control
public information is no aberration. Kid
yourself not.

The manipulation of information to ex-
cite fears of communism may be dated
from the emergence of the anticommunist
consensus itself. Following World War 11,
President Truman’s plans for the
economic recovery oi Western Europe and
aid to Greece and Turkey faced opposition
in a fiscally conservative Congress, At that
time, most Americans did not perceive im-
minent danger from the East. An ignorant
President Truman calculated to reach
Congress through a speech “designed to
electrity the American public.” He painted
a dramatic portrait of global politics. The
godless Soviet empire, Truman warned,
threatened to Bolshevize the Western
World and enslave the people of Vulnerable
nations. Only American leadership and in-
tervention could contain the spread of
communism. The American people

Dunn Hill reviews generic cigarettes

Believe it or not, there has been a de—
mand for a brief review of generic cigareta
tes. Many of my readers have asked for
my expert opinion and I, ever dedicated to
my fellow smokers, who I look upon as
blood brothers and sisters, telt it was my
obligation to research the topic. In order to
represent them with the most accuracy
possible, i smoked ten packs of generics
this past week: five packs of low-tar kings,
and five packs of 100‘s. (I don’t think a
valid judgement of a cigarette brand can
be made Without smoking at least a carton
of them.) My research consisted of smok-
ing these cigarettes while engaging in the
following activities: (1) Studying, (2)
Drinking coffee, (3) Drinking alcohol, (4)
Playing racketball, and (5) Doing the
backstroke in the PEC pool. Generic
cigarettes performed well under all these
conditions.

During me period of my research,
several friends asked why I was smoking
such a cheap brand. Was I running short of
cash? Not at all. I was smoking them
because they tasted good, And that is my
conclusion. Generic cigarettes which run
about thirty cents cheaper than other
regular store bought brands are by no
means of inferior quality. Their taste is
similar to Raleigh Lights, which are some
of the better light Cigarettes available, My
only complaint about generics is that they
tend to taste a little dry. This problem,
however, can be eliminated by keeping
them in your humidor until they are ready
to be smoked, If you don't have one, call a

responded as educated, demanding Con-
gressional approval of aid to Greece and
Turkey. (Skeptics may find a more
thorough account of this in Daniel Yergin's
“Shattered Peace")

Since then, many leaders in the federal
government have irightened the American
people into accepting enormous, unsound
defense expenditures, many imperialist
“police actions," U.S. support of brutal
dicmorships, the sur-realistic misadven-
tures of the C.I.A. and every other aspect
of their shortvsighted foreign policies, In so
doing, they have created an unnecessarily
dangerous state of tension between the
superpowers. They have also, as
“Democracy" magazine editor Sheldon
Wolin recommends, restricted the
vocabulary with which most citizens con—
ceptualize foreign policy issues and
politics in general.

In the Fall 1983 issue of ”Democracy,”
Wolin reminds us that most Americans do
not participate in politics directly. We de-
pend on our representatives in govern-
ment not only to act on our behalf but also
to interpret political realities for us, sup
plying the information used by citizens in
public discussion, problems for represenr
tatlve democracy arisewhen that informa-
tion is doctored or even manufactured.
Citizens cannot deliberate as effectively
lbout governmental policies if our infor»
mation consists of selectively
diseminated information and outright
lies. Thus the range of possibilities is are
tificially constricted; plurality of opinion.
in the broader sense, does not exist. The
Pentagon’s performance during the inva-
sion of Greneda provides a textbook exam-
ple of the problem described by Wolin.

Americans have been convinced that
Greneda represents a threat to American
“vital security interests" because the
Sovtets‘ communist contagion threatens to
infect other Lation American countries
through a Grenedean corridor. But recall
the Reagan Administration's original
justification for the invasion. The marines
entered Greneda to rescue U.S. citizens
and to respond to a request for help from
the Organization of Eastern Caribbean na-
tions, The justification has now been
shifted to emphasize Cuban and Soviet in»

contractor immediately and have one built
in your room. A humidor is a must for any
smoker who claims to truly enjoy smok-
ing. Another attractive feature of generic
cigarettes is the pack itself. They come in
a white pack with black letters saying
“Filter Cigarettes” and in the upper left
hand corner is a little hexagon which reads
“GPC Approved.H GPC stands for either
“General Pleasure Commission” or
”Generic Product Corporation”; my
research didn't go that deeply. So my rule
ing on generic cigarettes has to be
“Thumbs Up," You can take my word for
it, And remember Dunn Hill's word is as
good as the cigarettes he smokes.

I’d now like to take a moment to tell you
about an encounter I had recently with a
truly fine foreign cigarette. Just last week
I was granted the privilege of savoring a
few Parisiennes from Argentina.
Reportedly, these cigarettes are the
strongest filter»tipped cigarettes in the
world, and trying them for the first time
was nothing short of an exhilerating ex-
perience for me. The kind gentleman who
offered them to me warned that they were
quite strong and I shouldn’t take too large
of a drag the first time. “Nonsense,” I
replied, inhaling deeply, “I’m a pro
fessinal smoker." True, they were strong:
my heart began to pound, I became light
headed and my vision blurred momentarir
ly. It was great! So I immediately took
another puli.

My readers should be made aware that
the words “strong” and “harsh" when ap-

volvement in the region as a post-invasion
rationale. Why? Perhaps the Reagan Ad-
ministration feared that the public would
discover evidence which renders the initial
justification suspect.

For example. before the invasion, the
Grenedean government warnedtbe U.S. of
its fears of violence and recommended
that they remove U.S. citizens from
Geneda. The imprudent President Reagan
is no less culpable here than Jimmy Carter
was responsible for not evacuating our em-
bassy personnel in Iran before the Iranian
revolution, partisan polities notwithstan~
ding. It is also a little discussed fact that
the leftists in Greneda appealed to former
National Security Advisor William Clark
for aid and assistance. According to Larry
King, Clark listened for five minutes, read
the riot act to the Grenedeans and prompt
ly ushered the “commies” out.

To justify this unnecessary violation of a
state's sovereign territory, the white
House and the Pentagon have characteriz-
ed the Grenedean revolution as part of a
CubaanOViet plan to further proSoviet
revolutions in Latin America. How conve-
nient that we arrived just in the nick of
time! The public’s anti-communist
disposition gives the government a virtual
Midas Touch with which to generate public
support. Any blunder, characterized as a
communist target, becomes an interest
“vital to the survival of the United States,”
l.e. as precious as gold. (fool's gold?) With
it, one can stupify most people and
transmute the most problematical actions
into something alluring. In Greneda, a
Falkland Islandscstyle distraction has
been transformed into the fulfillment of
the Monroe Doctrine, American dispensa-
tion, and our “responsibility" (3 favorite
imperialist euphemism) as the free
world's champion. And most Americans
have little hope of sensing an alternative
interpretation of events in Greneda.

For support, pentagon oiiicials cite cap-
tured documents which purportedly prove
the existence of Cuban and Soviet
agreements to ship military goods through
Greneda. Alleging the existence of “secret
treaties” between Grenada, the Soviet
Union, North Korea, and Cuba, provisions
for major Cuban training bases, terrorist

plied to a cigarette brand don'tnecessarily
mean that it is bad. They simply mean that
those cigarettes have more “ﬂavor” than
others. As for filter-tipped cigarettes,
Parisiennes are the most ﬂavorful I've
ever tasted. In strength they easily com-
pete with Camel No-I-‘ilters. I highly
recommend Parisiennes if you love high
tar but don’t like getting tobacco in your
mouth from filterless cigarettes. (Tobacco
was meant to be smoked. not chewed.
That's why Prometheus gave fire to
humankind.)

Untortunately, Parisiennes are not ex-
ported by Argentina and cannot be pur-
chased in the United States. One line
teresting aspect of their non-export status
is that Argentina does not require the stan-
dard warning label on cigarette packs that
the U.S. Government does. In case you’re
unaware, that label reads: “Warning: the
Surgeon General has determined that
cigarette smoking is dangerous to your
health."

While on the topic of cigarette warning
labels, I might mention that in the near
future, due to pressure by the American
Cancer Society, members 0 the American
Lung Association, and lobbyists for other
anti-smoking groups, the warning label on
all Cigarettes sold in the US, will be
altered slightly. AS far as I know, the exact
wording of the new label has not been
decided, but it will be much more specific
than the current message, naming many
of the dlseases that smoking cigarettes
may lead to, This, they feel is necessary to

training bases and the training of Grene-

‘deans in the Soviet Union are revealed.
The State Department, however, refusa
to release the documents for public
verification of their contents. Selected in-
formation is to be released to the press by
the Pentagon, Thus, in the matter of the
U.S. invasion of Greneda, the Pentagon
will define the limits of public debate. The
American people will be ottered nothing
which even questions the fundamental
assumptions of our foreign policy regar-
ding Greneda, Latin America, or even the
Soviet Union. Can one imagine anything
more antithetical to the principle of
pluralist government in a democratic
republic?

One thing is certain. Americans cannot
count on the voice of anomer elite ”outside
opinion," such as ﬁle Kissinger Central
America Commission hoax, to seriously
explore policies much different from those
currently controlling. Who honestly
believes that Henry Kissinger, the ar-
chitect of Salvador Allende's downfall and
the illegal Cambodian bombings, will offer
a recommendation based on diplomacy in-
stead of force? Who can believe mat a
“Commission" which consists of, among
others, a labor union president and a
former Supreme Court Justice, but no
Latin Americans, experts who will otter a
policy radically diiterent from that cur-
rently pursued? The commission
members will rely on their staff members
who are chosen by Henry Kissinger,

To deliberate effectively about foreign
policy, American citizens must seek out
alternative sources of information and de
mand more honesty from the government,
Cathartic invective aside, we simply can-
not afford to remain complacent when our
leaders speak of fighting and winning
“limited" nuclear wars. The destructive
opinions of the American President and his
advisors vis-avis foreign policy (Latin
America and the Soviet Union in par-
ticular) are too dangerous to even tolerate.
Public pressure must force a forum for ge-
nuine debate, where the military no longer
has the power to define the terms of discus
sion. Only then can we hope for more con-
structive dialogue which centers more on
hopes than on tears.

help curb the smoking epidemic. It will
possibly read something like this: “Warn»
ing: The Surgeon General has determined
that cigarette smoking causes lung
cancer, heart disease, throat cancer,
cancer of the larnyx, and emphysema."
You may find my view extrme, but part of
the thrill I get irom smoking is that it may
eventually bring about my demise. I get an
existential feeling deep within my soul.
when I am smoking. I feel, as Alexander
naig once felt, that “I am in control here."
Personally, I can't wait for the new warn»
mg labels to come out. I’m sure that when
they do, Iwill regard smoking with even
more respect as an intrinsic part of my
daily routine.

In my next column, I will discuss several
of the most commonly asked questions
about cigarettes and will attempt to pro-

I have been in touch with the American
Tobacco Growers Association by
telephone this weekend and they have
agreed to send me some useful informa
tion which I will eventually spotlight. In
the meantime, if any of my readers have
had any interesting experiences with
cigarettes, I would like to hear about them.

Until next time, happy smoking, And
