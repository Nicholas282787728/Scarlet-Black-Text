Health Center:

We not just for disease anymore

The Younker’s Memorial Health Center
has long been an “outsider” in the campus
community. However, by improving com—
munication between the Health Center and
students, me Center hopes to present itself
as a student resource center.

The Health Center. through the utiliza-
tion of nurses, student clerks, and the
revised Health Center Sub-Committee, is
trying to promote health and well being.
According to Donna Bailey,l:tirector of the
Healﬂl Center, the maintenance of health
is a primary concern of most students.
Therefore, if studenB are informed as to
how to maintain their health, the needs oi
many students will be satisfied.

For those students who are sick, the
Health Center provides a wide variety of
services. These include patient referral
and transportation, me dispensing of non-

prescription medications, contidential
pregnancy testing, basic out-patient ser
vices, allergy shots, and immunizations.
Also, for students who are too sick to stay
in the dorms and not in need of hospital
care, the Center offers in-patient service
after assessment by a nurse.

The student Clerks are utilized to make
emergency care accessible during the
nurses’ off hours. Although, on the advice
from the college legal adviser, s.c.'s can-
not treat patients or dispense medication,
they can provide easy access to emergen-
cy medical personnel when needed and
handle many in-patient requesm.

According to Bailey, once the student,
the student body and the Health
Center understand the abilities and limita-
tions of one another, the Health Center will
become an active, accepted part or the col-
lege community

It was so quiet you could
hear a systems crash...

by Ellen Piekalkiewicz

“Dead Again" read one of the computer
terminals in the basement of Hurling
Library, and dead was the entire Grinnell
College computer system (or much of the
weekend and Monday morning.

According to Newton Munson, Director
of Computer Services, the crash was caus~
ed by a breakdown of two electrical com
ponents, resulting in the loss of two coma
puter tiles on Sunday. He added the tact
that only two tiles were ”jeopardized" is
quite amazing.

He said He crash was caused by a hard-
ware difﬁculty, which he referred to as a
“ﬂaky problem — the processor stops and
nothing appears to be wrong." The pr!»
blem was so complex that experts from
Digital Equipment in Des Moinoa were
called in.

The Grinnell College technician ap~
peared to have worked out the problem
Friday night He removed an additional
memory plate that had only recently been
put on the system. He removed this
memory plate and the system worked tine
for most of Saturday, Munson said.

However, the system crashed again
about 5:00 on Saturday and again they
were faced with iinding the bug in the
system, The “problem you have with this
type of failure" is that to ﬁnd me cause or
the breakdown “you must go through a
process of elimination,” he said. He
elaborated, “Either you fix it or it will fail
again.”

Technicians from Digital Equipment ar-

rived Monday at 10 am. and worked on the

system until about 10 pm, testing over
and over again for bugs. They eventually
found that the crash was caused by two
electrical component malfunctions in two
separate areas of the system. Thomas
Moberg, Associate Director 0! Computer
Services, said that dais crisis is “indicative
at having a single computer system."

He also said that Grinnell College is at
an “awkward stage now" because it is a
small liberal arts school, but at the same
time is a growing computer center. He
said We must decide “to what extent we
want to insure constant computer time."
He added that since Grinnell has budget
constraints, an absolutely consistent
system is not plausible at this time.

Munson said that an elaborate backup
system is really not necessary at Grinnell,
since this kind of crisis has only occurred
“once or twice in the last year " However,
both Munson and Moberg said Grinnell is
diversiiying its types oi computers in
order to put less strain on the system and
provide alternatives if the system does
break down,

The College has already purchased
several Micro-computers and IS working
out a plan with Digital Equipment to make
Microcomputers available to students and
faculty at a 35 percent discount, The dise
count price would be about $2275.

Moberg and Munson both strﬁsed that
whether one is working on a personal
Microcomputer or is logged into the cen,
tral system, one “needs to realize that it is
only an electrical and technical device"
which is bound to break down.

Munson elaborated, “The computer is
not a magical thing that is always there."

From Food Service to Mayor---
The American Dream at Grinnell

by Owen Charles

In municipal elections held maday, the
voters of Grinnell elected Dave McConnell
mayor by an overwhelming margin. Mcv
Connell, Director of Food Service at Gri
nell College, will step down irom his posi-
tion as a city council member to become
Mayor oi Grinnell.

McConnell won handily in all four wards
of Grinnell and received 1044 total votes.
His opponents, Paul Gearhart and Ray
Burlingame, received 473 and 212 votes
respectively.

The current Mayor, Floyd Beaver. is
retiring after 20 years as the city's highest
elected official. McConnell has
acknowledged Beaver's work as mayor
but also said that he will be a more active
force in city policies. The major campaign
issues were:

7 attracting industry to Grinnell

7 cleaning up Arbor Lake

7 repairing the sewer system

— fixing sidewalks

» the fate of the municipal airport

McConnell discused his plans for the
future in an interview with the Scarlet and
Black on Wednesday night. He Said urat he
will continue to run Food Semce and
devote the same amount of time to his
work at the college. McConnell said that
the“time commitment required of me as
mayor is the same as is already required
of me as a city council member," To Mc~
Connell, municipal policies is an outside
activity — ”other people my age belong to
the Elks or Lions clubs, I devote my time
to the city government,” he said.

Being director of food service at Grinnell

has been good training, said McConnell.
McConnell expects to get the usual gripes
that a mayor is accorded — complaints of
barking dogs, snow removal, etc. He plans
to publicize the tart the many Grinnell
College events and facilities are open to
the public, and said that he supports the
Mortar Board's community relations pro-
jects.

He also mentioned the possiblilty oi coir
lege students and faculty becoming involvA
ed in community problem solvirg. Such
projects as economic planning and studies
of the waste content of Arbor Lake were
cited by McConnell,

McConnell said he will concentrate on
the repairing oi sewers and sidewalks, the
cleanup oi Arbor Lake, and the attracting
of industry to the town. He also said he will
keep in touch with the public by means or
forums on the Grinnell radio station
KGRN and in the Grinnell Herald
Reiglster,

McConnell concluded that college-town
relations have improved signiﬁcantly in
the last five years and said he hopes to fur-
ther improve those relations as mayor or
Grinnell.

Also, on the ballet in the college district
(lst Ward) were candidates vying for a
seat on the city council. of the three can—
didates, Dean Bauer and Webb Wallace
were the iront runners and will compete in
an upcoming runoit election Baua‘ receiv~
ed 826 Votes, while Wallace got 462 and the
other candidate, Keith Rose, received 416.
