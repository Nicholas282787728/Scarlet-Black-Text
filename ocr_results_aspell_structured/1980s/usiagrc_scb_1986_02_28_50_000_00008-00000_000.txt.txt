Mt. St, Clare, 5942. ,

Pioneers finish
their season

by Paula Rue

The Men's Basketball Team closed out
their season on February 18, playing Mons
mouth in an away match~up. After leading
Monmouth 4740 at the half, Grinnell fell
victim to a 2nd half surge ‘by Monmouth
and came up a bit short, 97-88.

Despite the loss, Grinnell once again
turned in some fine performances. Dennis
Blyly closed out his collegiate career by
scoring a team-high 25 points. Terry
Chapko was close behind with 20 points,
while Darrell Scott contributed 14 points,
Both Chapko and Scott led the Pioneers in
rebounds ior the night, collecting e apiece.

Grinnell finished its season with a 7-15
overall record, and a +10 record in the con»
ference. The team will graduate three
seniors in May: Dennis Blyiy, who leaves
as the allstime leading scoreLin Grinnell's
history, as well as coscorlng leader in the
Midwest Conference this year; Dave
Dorsey, whose many iast breaks and in-
spirational plays have been an asset to the
team; and Doug Sauerwein, the team’s
number 2 scorer this year and the con-

ference’s leading rehounder.
However, Coach Gar Smith pointed out

that the program is still in fine shape. Next
year's team has a solid nucleus of letter-
winners: Darrell Scott and Eric Whitaker,
sophomore Terry Chapko, freshmen Steve
Logsdon and Wallace Squibb, plus the re
mainder of the bench, a solid JV squad,
and a host ol incoming freshmen.

Commenting on the season, Smith said,
“I don't think our record is an accurate in-
dicator of the level of performance. Our
games against Knox, Monmouth, and Car-
nell were all very close and not decided uns
til the iinal two mintues. In some games,
we were hurt by the absence of our 1 scorer
and our 2 scorer and leading rebounder.
However. i was pleased with general per
formance and that the team didn't give up,
even alter a slump in January "

with such a line squad returning next
year. Smilh and the Pioneers can look for
ward to an equally intense season.
