“This is modernized compared to what it
used to be,” said Professor Henry Buva,
this year’s director 0[ the Eeloit—Grinnell
Seminar in Rennes, France.

ball of red tape years ago.

First of all. there are the forms: long

there are no extras. They demand such in-

Richard Bachman, a Counselor at Grin-
nell’s high school, said that while roughly
40 percent of Grinnell high school students
plan to attend a four—year college pro
gram. the average number of students who
plan to attend Grinnell is about two each
year.

As the students get older, they tend not
to notice the college community as much,
and only a few high school students have
friends at the college. Other than that, high
school students set their Views of Grin»
nellians by the select demonstrations they
see in town, The Grinnellian dress and hair
style is the most noticed give-away.

One worker from Pizza Hut commented,
“You always want to wait on the College
students, they tip good."

One high school student observed that
“They usually eat at the Longhorn and are
usually wearing long jackets. They are out
of the ordinary."

A "twink” by general
consensus, is a semi-
deragatory term used to
describe the college

students whose general
appearance is a little '
sloppy, loose and baggy
and overly drowsy with a
few mild hints at

drug use.

High school students acquainted with
college students are more apt to talk about
Grinnell parties (especially those held in

fircampus houses). They get into the dir-
terent parties using many ditterent
methods. Using guest passes was the only

be so bad if it could be done all atonce, but
no, it is a strung-out ailair, a new form
popping up every once in a while.

Bova said he wished there were one
Central building with all the lorms" he
needs. Currently, he must make an ap-
pointment at the Centre Regional des
Oeuvres Universitaire Scolaires, located
in the central city, to get them, ”brlng
them back to give the students, and make
another appointment to hand them in.”

The processing is quite slow. For exam-
ple, it took more than a week for anyone to
receive his “Carte d'identite,” the essenr
tlal student identification card mat perr
mits use of the library, the sports iacility,
and the university restaurant.

“They can sure throw a party,” com-
mented a high school student.

A “twink,” by general consensus. is a
semi-derogatory term used to describe the
Grinnellians whose general appearance
could be described as little sloppy, loose
and baggy. overly drowsy (with a few mild
hints at drug use), and just ditierent. it
you fall into any of these categories, you
have probably been pointed out as a twink.

Another give-away of the college student
is the manner by which he crosses the
street, Grinnellians don‘t look beiore they
cross the street, and otten worry the high
school students that they might hit them.
At the same time, there are those few
unreported incidents where cars speed up
while a college student is crossing the
street. too.

Mrs. Killion, who was graduated from
Grinnel] High School in 1962, said that at
that time, Grinncll College was very
isolated from the town. Although Grin-
nellians were not called “twinks," they
were diilerent in many of the same ways.
Occasionally high school students would
hear about political rallies, underground
newspapers, nude demonstrations and
panty raids “which just seemed pretty far-
out” according to Killian,

There was not much mingling between
high school and college students; everyone
was kept very separate. Now, according to
Mrs, Killion, as tar as styles are concern-
ed, erybody looks the same.

Killion said, “It was visualized as a
separate community,”

One student who is currently taking a
calculus course at the college “likes the at-
mosphere or the college. It is very dit-
ferent from the town "

The responses or high school students in
town. when asked whether they would Cone
sider attending Grinnell College, were
almost equally divided between “It I had
the money," “It I had the grades,” and
“No, because it is too close to home."

— or so i judged from the attitude of the
very distressed woman'at the cash box.

Without our university ID, we cannot
make the nine francs we are allotted for
lunch go very far ,At the sandwich bar in
the central building, nine francs is enough
for a sandwich, but not enough for a drink
or a piece of fruit to go with it.

However. it's not just the red tape, or
“paperlasserie.” but the whole system
that can be frustrating. The first class in a

French university will live forever in me -

memories of the three Grinnellians who
experienced the “Salle de
comprehension." a room lined with rows
of chairs attached to earphones. A board
with something written about “Argot”
hung at the front of the room. A lighted
board with the numbers 1, 2. 3 and 4 stared
out lrom the wall. What to do?

If students cannot aﬂbrd
to support themselves
while attending the
university, they can work
instead of going to
classes, turn in work late,
and still receive a diploma
as long as they

take exams.

We waited for the professor, of course.
No professor came, Students came carryr
ing cassettes. Some put on the earphones.
Some Wrote. Some lel't. Hmml‘nm, We
ﬁnally discovered from another student
that mere is no professor but only a taped
message to which one listens. One was
then supposed to write a resume. No one
could really explain exactly what we had
to do, and we had no clear idea when it was
due,

“It is very badly organized.“ junior
Susan Frager noted with agony.

Apparently, organization is a problem
not only for the “strangers.” or toreign
students, but also ior French students. For
example, there is no printed schedule of
courses tor registration. One must roam
the halls of the ditrerent buildings copying
information from the notices affixed to the

March 6. 1987

walls.

Even after classes start, the unique
system of relaying information continues.
For example, one day a group or over 50
students sat waiting tor their professor
who seemed to he late for his psychology
lecture It was finally discovered that the
class had been canceled due to the pros
fessor’s ill health, but the notice had been
posted on a bulletin board on another floor.

“C'est un peu tau,” 6 French student
remarked with a shrug while exiting the
classroom. “It's a little crazy ”

However, the system does have its good
points, as one student from Thailand, Kan
Chaiprapun, pointed out. If a student's
tamily cannot attord to support him while
he attends the university, the student can
work instead of going to classes regularly
and turn in work late, and still receive a
diploma as long as he takes exams

“My neighbor works in Rennes and does
her studies on Saturday, The administra-
tion accepts her work late. There are a lot
at the Cite Universitaire who work.” Kan
said.

However, Students whose families can
support them cannot work

And tor the “etrangers,” the university
does have its good paints. For example,
although one must spend much time |n
class. there is not too much outside work.
If one can stand all the smoke in the halls
(it seems everyone smokes in France) and
all the red tape. life as an “etrangere” in a
French university is not a bad experience
at all.

 

When you're carrying a heavy classload, you don't need
hassels over school supplies. So. lighten the load at Forbes

Oltice Equipment in Grinnell. They can supply you with
everything from notebooks to typewriters (even rentals).

Stop by Forbes today and see how easy it is to lose some of

that unnecessary "weight“,

It‘s the smart thing to do.
