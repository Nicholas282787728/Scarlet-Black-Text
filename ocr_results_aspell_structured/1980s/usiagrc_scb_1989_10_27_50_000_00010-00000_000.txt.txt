Pioneers Break 4—Game Losing
Streak, Beating Cornell College

By Mick Kulikowski
and Steve Clem

The Pioneer football players
showed true grit last Saturday by
breaking out of a four-game losirtg
streak and whipping Cornell Col-
lege 25—7.

Grinnell has competed three times
since we last heard from them. The
Pioneers now stand at 1-3 in confer»
ence play and 3-4 overall. On Octo»
ber 7, the Pioneers lost to their con»
ference rival, the Kohawks. 30-7.
However, the score did not reﬂect
the true nature of the game, as Grin-
nell gave Coeallitcouldhandle. The
play of Coe‘s special teams was
superior to that of tire Pioneers and
ﬁguredprominentlyinthe final score.

OnOctober I4,the Pioneers battled
Knox to an 8~8 tie at the end of
regulation. The game resumed with
each learn being allowed an oppor-
tunity to score. Both teams cashed
in, but sadly, the Pioneers settled for
a ﬁeld goal, while the Siwash broke
the plane of the goal line against a
tiring defense that had stuffed Knox
to that point. The ﬁnal score was 14-
11, Knox.

Grinnell traveled to Mt. Vernon to
take on the Cornell Rams last Satur-
day, and instead of cowering in the
face of a four-game losing streak,

the Pioneers rose to the occasion,
After a relatively uneventful first
half, Grinnell trailed by 7 points, but
the Pioneers took control both offen-
sively and defensively in the latter
stages of the game.

Early in the second half, Grinnell
marched down the ﬁeld, getting a
number of key plays from a group of
seniorsQuaterback Dave Whitewas
the catalyst, converting two impor-
tant4th-down plays with a nifty run
and a great sideline pass to wide-
receiver Many Hunsucker. The drive
culminated in a 5 yard, touchdown
pass to tight-end Corey Jones. With
a successful 2-point conversion pass
to Hunsucker, the Pioneers led 8‘7.

That. however, was only the be-
ginning. Linebacker Lee Kraemer
took control of a ball popped loose
courtesy of Mike Anderson and
scampered44 yards fora touchdown.
That gave the Pioneers a 15-7 lead at
the end of the third quaner.

With the entire Grinnell .sideline
raising four ﬁngers to signify that
the 4th quarter would be theirs, the
defense quickly snuffed a Ram pos-
session. and the offense drove down
to the Cornell Svyard line where Jay
Ludlam booted a 22-yard ﬁeld goal.

The Pioneers then engineered
another drive which included an
incredible 35 yard run by White af-

Grinnell’s defense must be com-
mended for forcing sixComell tM<

usual, however, as the defense has

for the Grinnell women‘s volleyball
team. The Pioneers played a total of
seven matches over the nine-day
period and practiced on non-game
days. After suffering losses to Knox
and Cornell, the team achieved vic»

On Saturday. Oct 14, Knox are
rived at Grinnell ready to play. and
took the early lead by winning game
one, 15-7. In game two, the momen~
turn shifted as Grinnell served con-
sistently and showedstrong netplay.

victory had been secured at 15-13.

The second shift in momentum
occured in game three. The Knox

squad back into the match in game

Kathy Kritz confused the Knox de-
fense by varying their sets to the
outside. middle and off-speed hit-
ters. Courtney Wells used her power
toeffectivelytumpotentialfreeballs
into hard, down-balls.

As a communication break down
caused their defense to falter, Grin-
nell’s good offense was not enough
towin thematch,andthegameended
at 11-15.

Next, Grinnell faced Cornell. the
defending Midwest Conference
Champion, on Tuesday, The Pio-
neers lost in straight games of 3-15,
0—15, and 10-15. Grinnell was not
outrnatched by Cornell, rather they

beat themselves by failing to capital-
ize on the scoring opportunities they
worked hard to create. In the ﬁnal
game, Grinnell's accurate passing
and serving proved difficult for
Cornell to handle.

The Pioneers traveled to Upper
Iowa College on Wednesday. Oct.
18, and chalked up a victory. A
concerted team effort resulted in
scoresof15-4, 12-15, 15-10, and 15»
9, yet the players did not feel they
played to their potential.

"The victory was a nice feeling,
but we performed at their level. in-
stead of our own,” said middle hitter
Susan Egbert.

Grinnell’s fourth match of the
week was against the University of
Dubuque on Thursday. The Pioneers
gave a tremendous performance,
playirtg the U, of Dubuque close for
four games — 8-15. 15-6,7-15, and
13-15.

“Every aspect of our game was
played well. It was great to see eve-
rything come together because ev-
eryone was playing at their best."
said coach Sheila Cain. The players
said they were also satisﬁed with
their play.

“Although we lost our match
againist theU. of Dubuque, we were
more excited aboutour level of play
than we were after the Upper Iowa
match," said setter Amy Robinson.

The Grinnell Junior Varsity team
showed continued improvement in
their matches versus Central Col~
Iege and Upper Iowa College. After
losing to Central. an outstanding
performance at Upper Iowa led to
victory. The team has been sucessful
because each player has become
more comfortable performing on the
court, and that success should make
the varsity squadstronger in years to
come,

Both Pioneer teams play at Iowa
Wesleyan on Thursday, Oct. 26.

 

Appleton,Wisc.. the men traveled to
Colorado Springs for games with
Colorado College and the Univer-
sity of Colorado (the city branch).
While CC — ranked 13th in the
nation and ftrstin the West region;
nipped the Pioneers 1—0 in the opener,
Grinnell toyed with UC-CS two days
later, beating them 3—0.

Oddly enough, there was a cone
sensus among theplayers and Coach
Pﬁtsch that the Pioneers played a
much bettergameversusCC. Though
in a losing effort, a revatnped Pio-
neer defense labeled, appropriately
enough, “Colorado,” stiﬂed the
powerful home team’s offense al—
lowing the only goal on a near per-
fectshotnearthe endofthefirsthalf.

“We were much happier with the
CC game,” senior Torn McCullen
said. “We frustrated a very good, na-
tionally ranked team and kept our-
selves in a position to win until the
end,"

Unfortunately, the Pioneers were
unable to muster the offensive fire—
power to tally the points needed, a
situation which was quickly recti-
ﬁed down the road at UC—CS. Grin-
nell so thoroughly dominated UC-
CS, outshooting the home team 27-
I, that many Pioneer players ex-
pressed dissatisfaction with the rela-
tively low scoring total. But hey. a
win is a win. The three shots which
did ﬁnd the back of the goal came
courtesy of Mike Shay in the ﬁrst
half and Peter Grief and Bruno AI»
icke in the second.

The Pioneers now await 9 am.
tomorrow when they take on North-
em Division rival St Norbert in
Appleton, Wisc. Coach Pfisch says
he is optimistic about Grinnell’s
chances at the conference tourna-
ment.

“Theguysplayedheadsupsoccer
in Colorado and showed no anxiety
when facing the powerhouse" Colo-
radoCollege.Pﬁtschsaid.“Fallbreak
gave us a good week to relax, play
well, and prepare for the tourney.
We‘re playing at our bestright now,
we ought to be ready on Saturday."

Should the Pioneers beat St.
Norbert, they would play the winner
of the Lawrence vs. Coe game at 2
pm.

' “This weekend will show a lot of
what this team is made of," said
junior Ian Lorirner. “It’s up to us."
