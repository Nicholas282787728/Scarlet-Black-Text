Men’s Soccer Splits
Two in Minnesota

By George Mclimsey

The Grinnell men’s soccer team
returned from Minnesota last week-
end wilh awin and a loss to its name.
In games against Gustavus Adols
phus and St. Scholastica the men
began preparations for the confer-
ence season which will commence
in several weeks.

Both games were nail—biters, each
ending in double overtime and fort»
ing the men to prove their mettle
under pressure. This may be helpful
down the road in terms of morale
building as the team faces stiff
competition, both in and out of the
conference, in the coming weeks.

in the opener and after the smoke
cleared the opponent emerged the
Victor by a score of 1-0. Neverthe-
less, Coach Pﬁtsch was pleased with
the performanceof his troops, point-
ing out that ﬁrst-gamejitters slowed
the Pioneers, especially in the early
going.

Goalkeeper Dave Shane turned in
what Pﬁrsch referred to as “one of
the best games I‘ve ever seen,” and
was complemented by solid play
from wing Matt Schrager and full-
back Mark St Andre.

The second game, played far from

(on South Campus, between James and Haines Halls)

the watchful eye of the coach (who
returned to Grinnell to present a
marvelous halftime oratory at the
football game) ended on a positive
note for the Pioneers as they dc-
feated St. Scholastica 2-1.

The Pioneers were down 1-0 for
most of the match until left wing
Allen Joseph hooked one into the
goal with ten minutes left in the
game. The two teams then remained
locked in a 1-1 tie through the ﬁrst
overtime. The win was not ensured
until Tony Harris‘ shot found the
back of the goal in overtime number
two, lifting the Pioneers to their first
victory.

While many may view this season
as “a building year” for the Pioneers,
the experience they will obtain from
a brutal pre-conference schedule will
certainly go farin making them atop
conference contender.

“Playing these Minnesota teams
is always tough," senior Mark SL
Andre said. “but we played well last
weekend, which dida lotto improve
our conﬁdence.”

The Pioneers will need all the
conﬁdence and toughness they can
muster to get through this weekend
when Carleton, St. Olaf and Trinity
come to town for matches this Fri-
day, Saturday and Sunday.

‘Skull Crushers ’ and R003 Open Season

By Gerald Honigstock

Last Saturday Grinnell’s “Farm
Implement Skull Crushers," more
commonly known as the women’s
cross country team, opened their
season at the Cornell Ram Run. As
this was the first meet, the course
was shorter than usual 7 two miles
instead ofthe usual 5 kilometers (3.1
miles), but the women dominated
the meet in convincing fashion.

Finishing first with 33 points, the
Skull Crushers buried Wartburg, 65
points; Central,76points; and seven
other schools.

Taking first place overall was
JoAnne Sackclt, closely followed
by Susie Petherham, 6th; Christine
Thorbum,7th; Heidi Freiburger, 8th;
and Sam Robinson, 20th, who com
pleted the scoring unit. This is not to
say that only five runners raced,
because more than 15 other han-iers

competed. Several runners recover»
ing from minor ailments are expected
to return shortly.

The runners make up an extremely
talented team andfollowingthemeet
received a national ranking by a poll
of coaches in the NCAA Division
III. Way to go, Skull Crushers!

Meanwhile, the Purple Roos of
the men's cross country team raced
fourmiles, a mile shorter than usual,
over the same course. For this low-
key meet. the goal was to pack early
in lheraceand keep as many runners
together as possible.

In this, the R005 were successful
as Jonathan lave, who finished 4th,
led Todd Rowekamp, 6th; Jason
Maples, 10th; Jefolmer, 12th; and
Mark Couch, 14th, through the one-
mile loop and into a close second-
place team finish (46 points) behind

LOOKING PAST HANDICAPS

horas (44).

A 2-point difference in Cross
Country is akin to a l»point differ-
ence in a football game. The team
place is all the more remarkable
considering that Loras was ranked
as high as 9th in the nation last year.

' whileWartburg, which camein 1411.

at the nationals, finished 4th on the
day.

Behind the frontrunncrs came a
host of other R005 (and Weasels),
with Eric Fuld in particular showing
great improvement over last year.
This year, the team is training at a
lesser intensity early in the season
with the goal of keeping everyone
healthy throughout. The Reds have
a very balanced squad with repre-
sentatives from each class in the“top
10" of the team.

Tomorrow, the Roos travel to the
All-America meet at Luther while
the Skull Crushers have the day off.

Caryn Plait. who also worked at
Camp Sunnyside. added that “any-
body who is ready to go into a leam-
ing experience should work there.”
She is currently working to coordir
nate weekend respite groups to vole

unteer at Camp Sunnyside, in Des
Moines. The camp needs ﬁfteen
volunteer and fifteen workers for
weekends from September through
December. Counselors arrive Fri-
day afternoon for a brief training
session and begin working with the
campers that weekend.

Plait explained that the goal of the
program is to “provide a normal

weekend with fun activities." Work-
ing at the camp can be mentally
straining at times but, she said, just
watching someone who’s been up-
set all weekend smile or seeing a
camper ride a horse for the first time
will make the weekend worthwhile.
Flatt asked that students interested
in volunteering for a respite week»
end contact her.

Of course, the failures of the past
don’t persuade the hippies of the
present to think through their rhctor

this attitude, there wouldn’t be near
so many hippies.

l have a theory, though i don‘t
really thinkitmatterstohippies what
it is they are professing, so long as it
goes against some established as-

through it’s rebellion stage, with the
