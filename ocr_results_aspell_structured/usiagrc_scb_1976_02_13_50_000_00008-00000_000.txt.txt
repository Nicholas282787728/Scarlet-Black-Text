Quiet in the dorms

To the Editor:

This is a cowardly freshman’s
way out of confronting stereoosers
who regularly and blatantly
fracture ”quiet rules,” set up in
my dorm by my R.A., and a way of
filling up that blank space you
called attention to a few weeks ago.
I resent having to walk about my 9‘
by 6' room with earplugs in and
both of my doors shut in a heroic
attempt to defeat the persistent
bass notes invading my room. Not
that it is particularly cramping my
style, but it is probably annoying to
my roommate mat I very often
don’t respond to things like “the
room is on fire," “your mother is
calling irom Afghanistan and says
it’s urgent” and “Help! I'm being
eaten by a two-foot cockroach!"
(Only joshing about the iirst one.)

in addition, my roomsmate has
personally informed me that she
resents being asked “Say what?"
after every question or comment
she makes. I don't blame her. I
have become so efficient at
lowering the decibel count in my
room that I ﬁnd I communicate
much less with my room-mate, and
lieel that a lack of communication
is much less desirable than Bonzo
and the Wornp-Womps’ latest hit
penetrating my room from two
ﬂoors up (on ‘good’ days i can
make out every word the singer
spews forth and pinpoint his or her
every breathing place).

Suggestion: Why don't you bass
lovers buy headphones andor put a
rug or two on your floor? I have
noticed that this is quite effective
in muffling sound. If a person
spends X-hundreds of dollars on a
stereo, I suggest that the person
spend about one-tenth more on
headphones. You can still get the
stereo effect and, in addition, you
could avoid being swamped with
requests to turn down the stereo.
Even if you've put out the money
for a quadrophonic set you owe it to
everyone else to either reasonably
soundprooi your room or play it so

penetrating bass notes don’t drive

Pick Aretha’s ’You’

By DanHextcr

Aretha opens this album with an
excellent cut entitled “Mr. DJ."
and once again proves hersell as
the queen of all the R&B women
recording artists. “It Only l-lap
pens (when I look At You)” is
short but sweet, and is followed by

B rig/9t

a ballad “I’m Not Strong Enough
To Love You Again."
Throughout the years Aretha has
been releasing albums, we have
been able to see her go through
many excellent backup
musicians, among them a very
young bass player named Stanley
Clarke, who later achieved his own
fame with the Return to Forever
band led by Chick Corea. Also
heard with Aretha throughout the
past few years have been Cornell
Dupree and Chuck Rainey.‘

The band she recorded with on
this album, while containing fewer
notables than previous albums.
still maintains the tight
background sound Aretha needs
behind her as she belts out tunes
with incredible rhythmic velocity.
She has maintained the level music

moments

of this album for many years, and
it feels good to know that when you
go to pick up an album others that
you haven’t been able to hear in
and still maintain a large
audience, suggests that her sound
is here to stay. Since her sound is
not merely offered by the artists
and promoter to an audience. it
means that her sound is demanded
by the listeners. Aretha’s YOU is
worth picking up right away.
Once I Loved by Esther Satterfield
Esther Setter-field has released a

very pleasant new recording
consisting mainly of short tunes
made popular by artists other than
herself. If you have ever picked u ,
any Chuck Mangione albums,
you'll remember her from her rich
full pounding voice and a vibrato,
feel is unequaled by other {emal
vocalists.

This is her first solo album, and
in a very positive sense it lets the
music world know that she hag
something to offer that should not
be ignored. From “Summertime”
to “You are the Sunshine Of My
Life" to “For Once In My Life" I
couldn’t avoid becoming en-
chanted by the effect her entire act
had upon my mind and soul. She is
what I call mello. The album is
available from Adam records. and
would prove to be a valuable ad-
dition to any collection. I Shoul&
note one more small item~this is
nota jazz 1p. Anyway, listen all you
can and have some Bright
Moments. .

Hot gossip piles up a

by Sue Repp

Gossip. Last week i pledged that
all the hot gossip in the A. C. M.
would appear in these pages,
Thanks to all the iniormalion piling
in from loudmouthed correspon-
dents in our sister schools we can
now expand that promise. We will
print rumors about any underdog
unheard-oi college, Gunnar
Swenson. our prime leak at St.
Olai, phoned a few of these goodies
down. In a moment of triumph, he
promised to support them with
actual photographs and tape
recordings. Poor Gunnar - he
really is just waiting for another
Watergate leak, Has started here.
At Park College:

Nothing at all seems to be
happening. We aren't surprised at
all by this because we have never
heard of Park College. To be less
cruel. we do know that two films
were banned from that campus
this fall. “Clockwork Orange” and
“Candy“ were canceled [or
collegiate viewing due to too much
violence and sex.

Coe College:

There's an article published in

The article can‘t be reprinted in
full but it will suffice to Say that the
C.R.P.D., or Cedar Rapids Police
Department, spent $6,687 for a h“
raid in the summer of 1975. A Coe

Colorado College:

It has been rumored for a long
time that Colorado College
students were the richies of the A.

image was confirmed rece _
when a young coed called home
and told her dad that she couldn't
book a ﬂight home ior Christmas.
Her father, a most considerate
man, rectified matters im»
mediately by purchasing a priva
jet for his precious. The somewhat
surprised coed managed to take it
all in stride. Her main concern a,
the moment is where to park it.
She's considering leveling one of
the college libraries to make room
