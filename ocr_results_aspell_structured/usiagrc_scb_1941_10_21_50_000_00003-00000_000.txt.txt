Some Radio

Gear Ordered

S’revens Authorizes
Placing of Orders
For Specific Items

"President Stevens has authorized
the purchase of some radio equip-
ment," Herschel M. Colbert, dir-
ector of radio programs, stated
today. “Order-s have been placed
for several items, and we are
hoping to get these items if they
were not sold before our order
went in,” he said.

Tomorrow at f p. m. in the col-
lege radio studio the Radio club
will be formed, Colbert said. All
students and faculty members are
eligible to participate.

Colbert added that the difficul-
ty in getting radio equipment
arises from the new priorities
ruling. If the materials on order
now are obtained, and if other
items can be secured in the future,
it will be possible for the Radio
club to go “on the air."

In the meantime members of
the club will work up programs
in preparation for prospective
broadcasting.

earlier in the afternoon, and they
pursued the freshmen.

Overtaking them as they ap—
proached the fotthall stadium, the
police inquired about the lumber,
and asked that the chicken coops
be returned. The freshmen prom-
ised to take the chicken coops
back, and began to build their
fire.

One police officer estimated
that the load of wood was worth
not more than $15.00, Chaffee
said.

The owner of the half-burned
building had given the contract
for removal and sale to Preston,
and when Preston learned of the
freshmen's foraging, he called the
college and said that he valued
the load at $100.

Chaffee talked with the chief of
the fire department in order to
find out the probable worth of
the wood. He was told that the
entire building was not worth
$100.

The police chief and fire chief
promised Cliaffee that they would
talk to Preston and see if the
affair could be settled more amic-
ably.

Plans have already been made
to collect donations from the
freshman class in case Preston
wishes to collect the $15.00. If he
still demands the full $100, some
special program will have to be
gvien to raise the needed funds,
chaffec said.
