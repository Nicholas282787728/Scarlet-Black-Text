AN ADEQUATE PLAN

Staffs of The Scarlet and Black Monday night
approved a definite plan for a ncll'spztper siudcnt
Control board at Grinllcll find that. plan will bc
taken up by the facility at its mccting Monday.
Point by point, the plan proposed by students now
working for thc papcr seems to provide very well
for the change.

The first point proposes “the incorporation of
the Grinncll Scarlet and Black under an education-
ol, non-profit sharing plan. Controlling agencies
shall be Sigma Delta Chi, Thcta Sigma Phi. the
student council, the management of the paper, and
the college.” This mcrcly provides for the change.

“In place of the present system of manager
mcnt the business will be placed in the hands of It
board of directol , nine in number. seven of whom
shall be members of the student body and two of
whom shall be college officials.” The distribution
shall be of members including a junior and sonior
from both Sigma Dcltzl ‘lli ﬁnd Theta Sigma PM
a member of ally clas cation from the student
council, the college business manager and director
of journalism, and tlle cditor andhusincss manager
of The Scarlet and Black.

This gives thc sludcnts a seven to two majority
on the board, insuring student control and pro-
vides for the board carrying over each , car, The
two junior members and college officials will carry
over, of course, whilc the new editor and llusinc s
manager will have been close enough in actual wol '
on the paper to give the board a background of
experience each year.

The journh lstic organizations are represented
and college autho ’tlcs are on hand to see that
things are managed efficiently. It i. imperative
that the editor and business illauagcr llc membcrs
of the board for they are more illtililal'cly PICA
quaintcd with the actual work on the paper than
our other rcpresclltativc, They must be there to
protect their own poll rs and to have a voice ill
election of thc ilcw inanagcment. Thor, more than
any other , arc aware of the worth of, candidates.

The third point provides that. the board shall
elect the editor and business manager, who Sllllll
serve only so long as their work is satisl'l'lclor .
A two-thirds votc of the board will be necessary
to rclnovc cithcr from office and (he shall each
receive a salary of not less than . 50 per 1 Sue.
At the end of the year, cai'll shall lcccivc 25 per
cent of the net profit of the business and the res
lnainiug 50 per cent shall go into H sinking fund.

The presence of thc cditor and business mall—
agcr on the board will not affect possible removal
from office. According to the plztll, it will take four
votes to block such action, and the mall ill flue tion
has only one. His pllrtncr will know best of all
u'hcthcr or not he. lould he removed.

The salary ol‘ not lc ' than $770 on is‘ue was
figured all an hour ha To publ ll 1) creditable
pilpcr, the editor find business limllflgcr lllnsl Spond
fit least 30 hours \vcckly on the job. \Villl many
men, who do not work last, the positions require
more time. Since an ordinary college job, with
practically no l‘osponsillilily, pays 3. cents an hour,
staff incinhcl-s cousidcl‘cd 50 «‘Pl‘liS hourly onlv a
decent minimum wage for the heads of (hp paper.
Even then there is no consider ioli for the limo
which the ordinary editor and business manager
spends rhino up to the position 't the top.

In allowing pan of the not profits to he gi on
to the editor and hhsinrss manager, an effort is
being made to avoid the killing of initiative and
loss of desire to make the paper a paying businc. .

“The editor shall have direct control of pull-
lishing thc paper,” according to the fourth point.
“Both the editor and business manager shall be
cmpowcrcd to select department heads who shall
preferably have had experience on The Scarlet and
Black ” Certainly the editor should hc allowed
to 'crcisc his own judgment in handling the publi-
cation for therein lics one of its grcotcst values
to students. Selection 01‘ department heads must
be left. to the men directing the work for they

A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING
(From the Louisiana Reveille)

Prohibition is like a good maniyou can't keep it
down. It's all to the front again. The wets, defeated in
the house of representatives by a 277-187 vote, announce
that just one more election and the sodapop companies
will be filling bottles with light wine; the student counr
cll already has intimated that just a few more dances,
and it hopes to deal a body blow to public drinking at
Louisiana State.

It is not our purpose here to discuss pro and can
the evils and advantages of drinking and not drinking.
Without any statement of opinion, without any desire
for argument, we shall. to keep the peace, admit as
granted the theory that what a man does when alone
with himself and his bottle is his own business. But. we
cannot too strongly commend the student council or any
other body in its efforts to stamp out drunkeness at
dances and other public functions.

It is not a question of drinking per so, not a ques—
tion of cause, but of effectiwhat effect a few drinks
and a tuxedo will have on a usually perfectly sensible
man. The two don’t mix as well as you may fancy they
do. Nor do drink and football mix. nor drink and the
theaterior anything else, if you’ve had too much.

The Greeks load a word for itgthe Golden Mean.
Happy state! A place for everything, a time for every-
thing. a measure for everything, including drinking
Moderation in all points, intelligent behavior at all times.

And if s. man's sober self could meet his drunken
self at a football game or a dance, he would soon know
that the Golden Mean in drinking did not no where he
thought it did. The two would come to blows thru the
farmer’s disgust at the latter's infantile actions.

COLLEGE SPIRIT
(From the Omaha World Herald)

Students of Nebraska university are reported to
be worried because of the lack of “school spirit." The
Daily Nebraskan is editorially seeking its revival, var-
ious campus organizations are discussing ways of
whipping up the old enthusiasms, and even the faculty
has become interested.

Yet. it strikes us that a lull in collegiate spirit may
mark a distinct advance toward intelligence. School
spirit ordinarily is expressed by the massed cheering at
the football games, by the shirt tail parades. by the
sub rose beenhusts and by interclass cane rushes. In
short. school spirit is the exuberance of youth, a, means
of blowing off the excess steam of sheer animal spirits,
rejoicing in growing strength. It is fun to indulge in. and
its manifestations are amusing to watch.

But if we were a student at Nebraska university
We would not be greatly alarmed at a subsidence of
this spirit. We would think, rather, that some rather
silly and meaningless traditions had been shunted into
the ditch. We would think that the way was cleared for
a new kind of spirit. That spirit might be expressed
by a larger attendance at the library, by the burning of
more midnight oil, by the insistent quest for new truth
in the laboratory. That spirit would be wholly philo-
sophical about the loss of a football game, but would
raise relentless hell if the institution’s most renowned
faculty member were being lured away to another insti-
tution,

Borders Speak
on World Affairs

“American diplomacy would have
been futile it it could not have de-
pended upon the Lengue ol Nations
to affirm its stand against Japanese
aggrossmu," said Clark Elchcllycrgcl',
speaking on "The Sir-inelapancse coir
fict and the League of Nations," at
the morning session of the lowa col—
legc conIerencc on international re-
lations here this morning.

Mr. Eichelbergcr, mitlwesl. Seeker
tary of the League of Nations assoc}
ation. referred to Stimson's state-
ment that America. would not recog-
nize Japanese property gains in vio-
lation to international law which im-
plied the abandonment of the London

naval agreement if the Nine Power ,

pact were violated.
Moral Unity
He pointed out that, had other na-
tions failed to stand back of the Uni-
ted states, this country would have

been forced into competitive naval :

The speaker pointed to the failure

of any nation to join Japan in six '

months of fighting as evidence of
some measure of success on the part
of the league. “Moral unity against
invasion is evidence of machinery of
international law," he said.
Commercial Rivalry

Karl Borders, midwest secretary of
the League for Industrial’Democracy,
stressed two outstanding causes for
world friction teday, tariff and world
war debts. “We invariably find raw
and crude desires for some economic
advantage hack of War,” he said.

“It seems to me futile to talk of
disarmament in terms of guns and
gasses when seeds of war lie in com-
mercial rivalry. For us. a creditor
nation, to expect to collect our debts
while raising rt tariff wall, is an ab—
slirdity."

Mr. Borders pointed out that near—
ly all international disagreement is
tied up with the capitalistic system
of exploitation without international
