Committee Celebrates
Individual Sexuality

by Benjamin Root

“Sexuality is a tremendous part
of the individual.” For this reason
the Committee Celebrating
Sexuality has come into being. his
agroup ofStudentAffairs staffand
students working to develop
educational programs that celebrate
sexuality.

The committee developed
throughaprogramcalled"theTrav-
elling Birth Control Show" that
Resident Advisors (RA'S) gave at
the beginning ofeach year. Steven
Jones, the Associate Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs, described how in the
program,“the stuffjustgotoldand
then we realized that...wc wanted
to get into sexual decision mak-
ing." The Committee Celebrating
Sexuality addresses a wide spec-
trum of issues.

In the first semester, the
committee gave three presentations.
“Sex For Staners" focused on the
individual and clarified the
difference between sex and
sexuality. “The Gender Fender
Bender" talked about gender roles
and stereotyping ”It Takes Two"
focused on the roles and
responsibilities of each partner. as
well as thecommunication between
them.

According toiones andRA Dave
Clark, sexuality deserves to be

celebrated because it is a pan of the
personality, This is the reason for

the differentiation between sex
and sexuality. Jones explained that
“sex is an act. Sexuality is a pan of
the personality and is lived out in
different lifestyles. heterosexual
lifestyles. and gay or lesbian
lifmyles. These factors color the
way people think in addition to
dictatingwhotheyareattractedto.”
The committee is trying to get
people to talk about these effects
of sexuality.

Focusing on men's and wo-
men's roles, the programs are
careful to include the gay/lesbian
viewpoint ‘These are not justhetera
osexist programs." Jones carefully
pointed out, because they “want
people to be aware of their attitudes
and their roles.“ Student commit»

tee member John Danos agrees,
saying that the format“does not al-
ienate people“

The committee’s programs are
experimental and dialogue is
desired. “’I'hereareno rightanswers
to any of these questions,” Clark
explained. The goal is to offer a
comfortable setting where people
can give their unique views to each
other. “Sexuality is a part of
everyone’slife, and you have got to
talk about it." Danos added.

First semester many people were
talking about sexuality, and the
committee was very pleased with
the turnout. The committee has

planned for the future. This
semester two programs are
scheduled, on the topics of date
rape and male sexuality.

The committee is willing to talk
about many issues concerning
sexuality, most importantly those
which are not usually '31de about.
Danos expressed the concern that
“thepeoplewhoarecomingarenot
the ones who need to be coming."
The committee wants people who
are not as comfortable with their
sexuality to attend. They celebrate
sexuality and wants people to
become aware of and comfortable
with their own sexuality.

Visiting Chinese
Scholar Speaks
on Literature

 

by Sasha Aslanian

Zhuang Guo-ou, a visiting
scholar in the English department
fromNanjingUniversity,deliveretl
a lecture last Wednesday entitled
“American Literature and Chinese
Politics."

He began the lecture with the
question, “What American author
ismost famousin China?”to which
the audience quickly answered:
Mark Twain. That‘s the easy pan.

What the audience of English
and American Studies professors
and majors did not know was that
Twain’s most well-known work in
China is a short story called
“Running for Governor.“ No one
in the audience seemed familiar
with this story, which deals with a
man discredited from a
gubernatorial race because, as he
gets up to speak, a small flock of
children ofdifferentraces run up to
him and embrace him, crying,
“Daddy!“

This anecdote illustrates the fact
that the American texts used in
English classes inChina are chosen
on thebasis ola content which will
further, rather than threaten. the
aims of the Chinese government.

Zhuang stressed that "the Chi-
nese have their own canon of
American literature." American
works that are favored in China
tend to be realist works such as
Upton Sinclair‘s The Jungle and
others which depict the horrors of
urban life in a capitalist society.

The resulting canon can be a bit
narrow, frustrating American
professors teaching in China.
“Chinese ofﬁcials choose to defend
the narrow selection by claiming
that Chinese students prefer the
standard texts when, in fact, lhatis
not the case.“ said Zhuang.
American bestsellers such as
Hollywood Wives byiackie Collins
are popular in China.

“In the late 1980‘s, before the
Tiananmen crackdown, the
government adopted a relatively
liberal cultural policy," Zhuang

 

Zhang Guo-ou

explained, “ltwas during this time
that American bestsellers were
introduced to the Chinese market
and received with enthusiasm.”
Since the crackdown, however, the
government is exerting tighter

, control on the literature again.

Zhuang's background in litera-
ture is varied. After completing his
undergraduate degree in English at
NanjingUniversity,Zhuang worked
as a translator for foreign merchant
ships for two years. When he re—
entered the University,he wrotehis
master’s dissertation on Eugene
O‘Neill. He says with a laugh that
it was his experience working with
seacaptainsandsailorsthatgothim
interested in O’Neill's plays.

At Nanjing University, he
teaches classes ranging from
beginning English to advanced
courses on literary theory. He is an
editor of C onlempomry Foreign
Literature. one of the leading
foreign literary magazines inChina
with foreign subscribers. it has
published‘Waitingl—‘or Godot" and
J ohn Updike’sshort stories recently,
as well as Zhuang's translation of
O'Neill‘s “Marco Millions."

This year at Grinnell, Zhuang
collaborated on a translation of
Czecholslovakian PresidentVaclav
Havei‘s 1968 article “Thel’ower of
