A, Kerry's, like, dead... I recently heard
that speech he gave on the floor of Corr

I was like, “I want THAT man to be my
president." He knows that the vast major-
ity of progressive people... will votc for
him because they don’t have anything bet-
ter. So he takes that for granted and then
plays tho really straightrandrnanow modr

voters. I would like to hope that when he
gets into ofﬁce he’s not actually that con-
servative and he knows who his constitu-

“The only two people in America who
don’t think mistakes were made in Iraq are

presidential candidate John Edwards in Cedar

the two and a halfhour drive to see the rally.

Presidential hopeful John Kerry was origir

Cellular Center, bot cancelled due to laryngir
tis. Grinneliians did have a chance to see John
Kerry last year when he visited campus before
the Iowa Caucus. Ben Jacobs ‘06, head of the
Campus Democrats. said that it was “one of
the largest crowds I have ever seen in the pa,

Last Thursday, the crowd was filled with
signs proclaiming that laborers, women and
lowa were all tor Kerry. Other signs rcpeated
common Dcmocrnnc slogans. proclaiming
that Kcrry and Edwards “Fight for Us," and

“[The] current cost of the war is 200 billion
dollars and counting,”he said.

Edwards also emphasized health care issues.

open borders to Canadian

Carole King, a rogur
lar participant in Democratic rallies in Iowa,
dedicated her performance of “You’ve Got a
Friend" to John kcrry. “This is not about party,
it is about who is better qualiﬁed to lead the
country," she said, introducing iown govcmot
Tom Vilsack, who in turn introduced Ed-

The Campus Democrats do more than lis-
