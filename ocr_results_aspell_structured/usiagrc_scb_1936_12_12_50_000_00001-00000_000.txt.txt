Miss Eleanor Lowden, pro»
lessor of English and one of
the sponsors of Cap and Gown,
commented, “Cap and Gown
has always had on honored po-
sition on the campus, but I
feel that the time had come
for it to achieve national rcc-
ognition." She gave much of
the credit for the success of
the application to Miss Evelyn
Gardner, dean of women, and
also a sponsor of the local or-
ganization.

“A Mortar Board pin has the
most practical value of any
which a woman can take off
the campus,” Paul ,S. Wood,
professor of English. stated.
“An employer or a graduate
instructor recognizes in it a
combination of academic prow-
ess and qualities of leadership."

merited, “It is a splendid ach-
ievement and will mean a great
deal to Grinnell women, par
ticularly in graduate sellool."

dless, registrar, “It is a distinct
honor for the college as well
as for the organization that
made the application."

Ames Last Night

Grinnell to Stop

Tonight at 30 o'clock in the
men's gym Coach John C. Truesa
dale will have opportunity to see
one of his pet theories regarding
basketball in actual operation, For
many years Truesdale has held
that .the cage sport involves too
few players, and that rules should
be worked out so that more men
may play.

Truesdale lined up For-rest Eit-
gcrs, Coe basketball mentor, in an
agreement to play home and home
games this winter, each coach to
use his own rules So tonight,
Gr-inriellians will have a chance to
witness a novel basketball game
in which each side ‘will use at
least 10 men.

Tonight‘s miles

The rules for tonight's encoun-
ter call for the game to be played
in three 15 minute periods, no
single player to play more than
two pcriods. This makes it nec~
essary for each coach to use at
least 10 men.

The chances are that Trposdale
will regret the fact that he must
use 10 men before the evening is
over, for a streak of iinpsralleled
misfortune has deprived the Pio-
neer squad of three star- perfor-
mers, Fred Luther, Wilbur Luick,
and Vernon Cornish,
