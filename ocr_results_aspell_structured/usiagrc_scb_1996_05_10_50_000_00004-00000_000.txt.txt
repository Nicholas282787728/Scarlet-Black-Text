"From the Right"
To the Editor:

ThislettetislnrcsponsetoDaw
id Rudel's article printed in the tri—
day, May 3 issue ofthe 8&8. In this
article,Mr,Rudel tookasmgle scene
in one movie, and used it to make a
“commentary" on so-called hypoctir
sy in this country. Furthermore, he
seemed to be specifically talking
about incidents othypocrisy within
the AtticanArnerican Diaspora.

First of all, Mr. Rudel quotes a
scene frorti Waiting to Exhale, in
\\‘l\lCl‘\ a black man leaves his wife for
a white woman. The dialogue he
quotes ends with the black wire sup.
posedly accusing his husband otnot
being black. I have issues with both
how he interpreted this scene, and
how he used it later on in his article.
However, right now I will restrict
myselfto lost his interpretation.

Mr. Rudel asserts that the wrfe is
being a “bigot”, However, I’d like
Mr. Rudel to point to one reference,
not only in that scene, but in the
whole rnovre, where white people
are portrayed in a negative manner
as a group. There are several white
people in the movie, yet Mr, Rudel
seems to be denouncing the woman
inquestion due to herattrtudes about
one single person, who so happened
to have stolen her husband ofeleveri
years. I’m not saying that the fact
that the mistress is white doesn't
make a difference. I yust take issue
wrth the use of the word “bigot".
During no instance does the woman
in question make ANY derogatory
comments about white people as a
group.

Now, limsiire right now people
are thinking: “But isn’t calling her
husband not black a racial slur?" I'm
here to tellyou right now that it isn't
A mcral slur involves a prejudice
towards a certain race. Angela Bas—
sett‘s chatacter(l got tired of calling
her “the woman in question") had a
prejudice not due to race, but due to
respect, I'm not sute if Mr. Rudel
knows the embarrassment and hurt
that is involved when someone cheats
on you. I’m here to tell you that l
have been a first hand wrtness to a
marriage breaking down due to inf!»
delity. Yes, the wife did accuse the
husband ofnot being black. No, the
mistress was NOT white. The hus—
band was accused of not being black
because of the disrespect to a black
woman, not the race of his mistress.

With that out ofthe way. I can
talk about Mr. Rudel’s use of this
incident to vilify the rest ofhis arti—
cle. Firstofall,Mr.Rudelassertsthat
it is somehow “alright" for a “minor-
ity" to take pot shots at whites. I
challenge Mr. Rudel to prove (lint,
Theonlyevrdenceofthislcanthink
of are Richard Pryor/Gene Wilder
movres, where stereotypes were ex«

plored and made frin of in a POSI—
TIVE manner, and on both sides of
the racial coin

Furthermore, Mr. Rudel asserts
that “minorities" have “lead an at—
rackonmanyfrontsartackingpeople
for seeing difference between indi—
viducils based on race, gender, etc."
Once again I challenge Mt Rudel to
prove this Hos Mr. Rudel been deaf
to the talk inherent on this campus
about MULTICULTURALISMI
The very basis otthis concept denies
the notion of there not being any
differences. What I believe Mr. Ru—
delseesasafightagalnst"difference"
is in actualitya fight against ineqtial<
ity caused by these differences. I
should state here that I find it ironic
thatwhile MLRudelrstalkingabout
pot shuts in movies he takes this
opportunity totake pot shot atAffrrr
mative Action. However, that's an«
other letter, betrersaved for another
time.

iVlr.Rudelthengoesontobtoad—
en his analysis, somehow linking
waiting to Exhale to someone’s (le—
fact-:ment of Republican property.
Well, Mt, Rudel, let me say, l simply
cannot rate the blame for that The
second you have prootthat a “minor—
ity" defaced your property, come to
me and I will personally apologize.
Until then, please show respect and
do not blame me for actions based
purelyonrnyethnicbacltground, and
how you perceive that background
Furthermore, I cannot accept the
blame for whatever problems you
have with Bill Clinton. Yes, I would
have voted rot him were I the legal
voting age, but first of all I was not,
and second ofall a great deal otyour
race voted for him as well.

Lastly, I’d just like to end this
letter with some observations about
Mr. Rudel’s article that I hope every—
one wrll think about. First ofalI, Mr.
Rudel seems to have a problem with
women cheering when a woman
stands for her rights, Does Mr. Rude]
advocate a totally male dominated
society? Mr. Rudel seems to be an.
gered by the fact that blacks can say
“nigger" and he Cannot. First ofall
being white does not prevent one
from saying that word. Any black
person who has gone into town can
tell you that. Furthermore, I must
ask. why does Mr. Rudel want to use
that word? Lastly, I am disheartened
byMr.Rudel'suseofthewordminor—
ity. Minority implies littler than. I
think itsobVious inthiscase ivhoMr.
Rudel thinks I as a "minority" am
littlet than.

It is for these reasons that I ask
for a formal apology from Mr. Rudel.
What he said is biased, and in fact.
yes, bigoted, He makes broad gener—
alizations about me and my fellow
“minorities", and even goes as fat as
to blame us for public defacer—nent,

and for his problems With the current
government administration.

To the Editor:

For the past few weeks I have
beensilent about opinionsexptessed
in Mr. David Rudel’s commentary,
“From the Right ,, l have decrdetl
that it is time to break niysilence and
respond to many issues that he deals
with that I feel need attention.

In Mr, Rudcl’s April 19, 1996
commentary-he staies that “Liberab
ism is an utter failure " One of the
reasons he gave for its railure was
becausc it “blunts capitalisiiiiiian
economic system which, according
to Rudel, “allousstich great efficien-
cy in production tbai even the poor
live in relative abtirtdarice,,,” My
first question to Mr Rutlel is, what is
"relative ubuiidancez" How does he
know that the poor live in such a
conditioni lfthepoor live in relativc
abundance, then why do we have
programs like Medicare. Medicaid,
AFDC, and Food stampsz it is so
easy for a person who holds power
and lives in comfort to make state.
incnts such as the one I have ad.
dressed.

in his April 26 and May 3 com»
inenraries, he attacks affirmative ace
tion. In his criticism ofthis govern»
merit policy, it is clear that he does
not ltnow why this “institutionalized
discrimination“ was created. Affir»
matrve action was created to give
qualified people ofcolor and women
jobs that would have traditionally
gone to white males. It was created
to combat the institutionalized dis«
ctimination that was created and
sustained by a white malerdominarr
ed government before the Civil
Rightsera Institutionalizeddisctlm<
ination in this country did not begin
wrtli the formation of affirmative
action in the woes, but began intlie
17005.

Also in his May 3 commentary,
Mr. Rude] talksabout the presence of
hypocrisy inAinerica. To add weight
tohisargument.liespeciticnllypiclts
onpeopleofcolorandaprogramrhat
directs them. He neglects to mew
tion that “race hypocrisy" did not
begin with people ofcolot but began
with white men—the founding fa-
thers ofthe United States ofAmerr—
ca. In 1776, Thomas Jefferson elo—
quently stated in the Declaration of
Independence, "all men are created
equal.” Eleven years later. George
Washington and other white men
put their signatures on a document
(the Constitution) which strongly
implied that a black man was only

In addition to talking about the
hypocrisy among people of color, par—

 

riciilarly African—Americans, he at-
tacts the NAACP for not stepping

he neglects to mention is that the

Before I bring this letter to a
close, I must ask a qtiesiiori that \\ as
posed to me by a good iricnd based on
the following comment by Mr. Ru.
del- “wit is negative for a white man
to call a black ‘niggel't‘ (Though, of
course. it is perfectly fine for blacks to
use the term amongst themselves),"
Why would white people want to
call a black man a “niggerl” in the
past, and even in the present, this
term was used by racist white people
to degrade people of African ances-
try. I know of many black people
ivho do not refer to themselves and
will not refer to other blacks as “mg
gets ”

Furthermore. I hope that Mr.
Rtrdel and other people who share
his yiews attentl future White Alvare<
ness Seminars, multicultural discus-
sion (put on by SACKistutlents
AcquiringculturalKiioii-leclge),and
Diversity Coalition presentation to
gain a different perspective on their
views. If they have been in nttcn»

then I hope they will reevaluate
some of their feelings I hope they
do, because the future of this nation
depends on it.

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to some
ofthe statements made in the article
written by David Rude] which ap
peared in last week's edition of the
8&B. First, Mr, Rtrdelcontends that
when Hollywood creates an eVil or

Scarlet]; & Black

stupid character, he is “normally
white, normally male. almost always
one of the two." wide I agree that
the evil/stupid characters are not«
trially male, I disagree with the idea
that evil characters are normally
white. In most or the movies I have
seen, the robber, rapist, murderer,
idiot, drug addict, etc, is normally
black. and other people of color are
hardly represented at all Positive
images ofpeople of color in general,
and blacks iii particular, are scarce it
not liot\»t‘xl5[ﬂh[. Later in the ntti<
cle.Mr.Rudelststesthat“minorities
[are] . attaclting people for seeing
ditrercucesbetweeniiitlwidtialsbased
on race, gender, etc ,, \Vhat minor.
itios have actually been attacking is
rho ntgative portrayal of people of
color as civil or stupid and iii sortie
cases, the blatant absence of people
ofcolor in films and in ihc industry at
large.

The second statement in the
article that I found particularly dis.
[urbl|\g\v:‘is“ltispOSiiiVefOrauqut—
ity to make weltcratted pot shots or
white males while it is negative for a
white man to call a black ‘riiggerx
(Though. of course, it is pertectly
tinerorblactstousethetcrrnainongst
themselvesi." in the first place, I do
not understand how one can com.
pare rating pot shots at whites to
calling a black person a “nigger."
Secondly, l have yet to meet a black
person who finds it appropriate for
ANYONE. rcgardless otrace, to use
that term.

The third problem that I had
with the article was the characterizar
tion ofthe audience's reaction to the
film “Waiting to Exhale.” Consider—
ing the fact that I was one of the
black women in the audience who
applauded at the scene Mr. Rudel
mentioned, I feel that 1 can speak to
the rtasoning behind my actions
(please be aware that my reasoning
does not speak to the motivations of
the other black women in the audir
ence). Inthedocumentary“AQues—
tionofColot.”KalhleenCleavetstar»
ed that “For so many many years, we
were told that only white people were
beautiful:onlysttaighthait,lighteyes,
light skin was beautiful” (Sandler
1992). To me, the husband leaving
his black wife for a iihite woman
basically meant that he had bought
into the myth that black women were
not beautiful. Though this is not true
for most. if not all. interracial rela-
tionships, this situation was unique.
In the novel from which this movie
was based, the husband did not like
black people; his only goal was to
become as close to white as possible.
Therefore, I applauded the tact that
the wife informed him that he need
ed to love himselfantl his people; “it
would be better if,,.[he] were black "

The last statement that I would
like to respond to hcis to do with Mr.
Rtidel‘s definition of affirmative ac»
tion. He stated that "affirmative
