'AMNESTY DAYI' MONDAY
AT GRINNELL LIBRARY

Monday there will be a gen-
eral amnesty at the college li-
brary: books and magazines
may be returned to the Library‘
desk without fines and with no
questions asked. The library
staff is encouraging students to
bring in any stray library books
or periodicals they find

According to librarian Hen-
ry Alden, the free day will ,
provide “is chance for students l
to Show that the open stacks
policy is justiﬁed" He said ;
that in the last. few years the ;'
library has worked increasing-
ly on the principle of open
Stacks, and that there has
been some increase in the
loss of books under- this pol- l
icy. ‘

About 350 books (including
volume 21 of the Encyclopedia
Britannica) and Several boundi
and unbound periodicals are‘
known to be missing. Many of‘
these, especially the periodicaisl
are irreplaceable and their;
loss can greatly hinder library:
service to the students. .

This court, situated in the biology wing or the science build-
ing, has long stood empty Before Convocation, in an emergency
measure to Spruce it up a bit, the ground was covered with gravel.
None of the biology students, however, were satisfied with the
appearance of the area.

That disalisfacﬁon led to various discusslons with Calvin C
Haugh (buildixus and grounds), who oilered a maximum amount

of material aid to the students ii they would plan a landscaping
scheme for the court and would do the manual labm' themselves.
