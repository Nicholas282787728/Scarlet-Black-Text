Two interesting Situations are

however, iii that Pearce and Bute

,represent two collections of room-

mates. Just who will withdraw in
whose favor is a pertinent point
currently, since any of the girls
involved can command a substan-
tial tollowing in her own right.
Iil fact, should Miss Berio remain
is the contest, she will otter
some of Miss Ross' strongest
competition. In the Pearce-Butler
duo, Miss Butler may be persuad-
ed to relinquish claim to the
council presidency in order to
take a league board position, for
which she has been predicted a
likely candidate.

Another nominee who perhaps
Will be more interested in an al~
most certain league hoard presi-
dency is Lucy Troivbridge.

Russ Accepts

Miss Ross deﬁnite acceptance
ot her preliminary nomination
has dispelled rumors that her
election oi physics honors work
next year would prevent such
extracurricular activities as the
council 'presidency.

What political machinations
will go on before the final selec-
tion ot two candidates at the
nominating convention on March
13, are now in the hands or the
unofﬁmal campaign managers
who have ilocked to the support
of various nominees. Some ofthe
usual color and excitement of a
Crinnell campaign appear to be
lacking at this point, but election
Judges, David Sparks, Barbara
Wagner and Keith Elle are urg-
ing 100 percent student interest
and participatioin in the tradi-
tional contest.

Elect Delegations

Delegates for the convention
will be elected in housemectings
Monday night. Each house resi—
dent will vote for five hall mem-
bers, and from the resulting list,
delegates in the proportion of one
to every iour house residents will
be taken.

All college students can attend
the convention, but only delegates
will be allowed on the ﬂoor of

 

the convention.
