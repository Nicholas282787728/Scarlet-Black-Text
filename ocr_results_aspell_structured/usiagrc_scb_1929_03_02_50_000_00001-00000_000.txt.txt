TEAMS EVENLY MATCHED

Oklahoma. Aggie: Expected To
Win Though Points Should Be
Evenly Divided.

Boasting strength in the 4-idyard
dash. hurdles. pole vault and mile re»
lay. a sound of Pioneer trackmen
compete tonight in the Missouri val-
lcy indoor track inset with a good
chance to win in any of these events
and an outside chance to take the
meet.

According to dope. first places are
so evenly divided that the team gctr
ting most seconds and thirds will
probably win. The fact that Coach
'Duke’s squad is the best balanced
Grinnell has had in years gives
the Pioneers a chance to place well
up in the standings.

The Oklahoma Aggios are repre-
sented by a strong team including
Faulkner who looks best in the mile
run and Best. a burdler who may
fight it out with Taylor for first
place in the barrier events. Hollen»
book. a crack half-inner from Creigh-
ton. is expected to take his event
while Wenger and Edwards of Grin-
-nell are given a fighting chance to
mace.

llIcKee‘s Ullullces Good

Drake should score heavily in the
sprints with Parks who placed high
last year and Craig who has beaten
'Parks on one or two occasions this
winter. McKee seems to be almost a
certain winner in the quarter mile
while the Oklahoma squad should
score heavily in the two mile.

While the field events may be a
deciding factor in the meet, no con-
ference school has showed much
strength there. Taylor recorded a
leap of better than twenty—one feet
last Saturday in the broad jump
against Drake which puts him in the
running for honors in this event
while McCully. cc-cantnin. who has
just shed his basketball togs for a
track suit. placed in the high jump a
year ago. Greene and ddensley liotb
are conceded a chance to place in the
pole vault each having a record of
12 feet.

The mile rellzy. which may be the
feature event of the prugram. should
go to the Oklahoma. Aggics judging
by time comparisons. but Grinneli
has a good chance to win after turn-
ing in good time last week without
strong competition.

Lowden Talks To ,
Y. W. Association

Says That Modern Women Trying
To Combine Home and Career.

"We are educating our young Wonk
en today just as our young men."
Miss Eleanor Lowden said. in her talk
on "Vocations" at the v w. C. A.
meeting Thursday night. “without any
frank facing of the fact that a goodly
portion of our women look upon a
vocation only as a temporary make-
shift until they marry and become
wives and mothers.

“There is a growing movement to-
day for educated women to attempt
both the home and the career. What
is most ncded now is to train our
women in vocations that they may
carry on. possibly part time. while
their children are small. and to which
they may go back when the children
are grown.’

There are few vocations today
which are not open to women. Too
many women go into teaching be-
cause it is the easy and obvious thing
to do. In many businesses. women arc
sought to fill certain positions. while
the woman of ingenuity will find her
own avenue of work. Various kinds
of establishments and personal serr
vice bureaus have been started and
successfully carried on by women.

"The Monkey‘s Paw." one-act play.
which was to have been presented her

The Pioneers started very slowly,

Joy Says Secret of Camping To Do
Things Not To Be Done When Home

 

By liclcn Klugt-rv.

”The secret uf Camping IS to do the
things at camp that you can‘t do any-
where else.” Miss Barbara. Joy. uri-
Llanfilly kuuwn member of the Citrnp
Director’s association said in an in-
terview yesterday, "of course the
only real idea in having a camp is to
give girls a good time. yet to make
it a. worthwhile vacuiion, too."

Miss Joy has just concluded an in-
tensive Camp Councillor's training
course. given here this week under
the auspices of the W. A. A. The
course has been given in various
universities but Gl'innell is the first
small college to offer it.

“Grinnell girls don-t know how [or
tunate they are." Miss Joy said. "in
having so short a course, I never
taught anything in my life before I
did this, but girls have told me [Liftt
I got more work out of them than
any other teacher they llﬁld.”

The theories that Miss Joy CXr
pounds to college girls in winter sbc
curries ouL in the summer in her own
camps at Three Lakes. Wisconsin.

 

The Joy camps. Camp Pioneer for

 

girls of intermediate and junior ages.
and Deornatb Lodge for senior girls.
are situated in a two-hundred mile
lakc region, affording many oppon
tunitics for fifteen to seventyrrive
mile trips canoeing. horscriding. hik-
in: or gypsum;-

One councillor is provided for each
two or three girls. although all fllSr
ciplinary matters arc settled by a
camp council selected from the girls
themselves. it is surprising. thaugli.
Miss Joy said. how few of these prob-
lems arise. In the eight week camb
period. lasting during July and Ang-
ust. on organized camp morale can
be established. "it is true. too.
though." she added. “the more you
expect of each girl. the more you
set." ’

There is no fixed daily program in
the Joy camps. The schedule varies
with the weather and the "intelligent
wishes" of the campers. Girls are
taught to be resourceful and ingeni»
oils by helping to plan their own ac-
tivities. which they are encouraged
to spend in the cut—of—docrs.
