MOVIE CRITIC

Seven

Serial killers have long been fa—
miliar fodder for films, but Seven
offers a particularly dark and disturb—
ing entry in the genre. Brad Pitt is a
young cop paired with a wise veteran
(Morgan Freeman) to examine a se
ries of especially grotesque murders.
They discover the killer is using the
sevendeadly sins as the blueprint for
his crimes and searches for clues in a
number of places, including Dante’s
Divine Comedy. Their investiga.
tion leads themdeepet into the crimes
until they become caught up person—
ally. Seven features one of the most
unsettling and genuinely scary end—
lugs to cross the screen in recent
years,

Eat Drink Man Woman

Director Ang Lee follows up the
success of The Wedding Banquet
with Eat Drink Man Woman. Set in
Taiwan, Eat Drink Man Woman is
an enticing tale ofromance and fam-
ily. The tone here is earthy; this is a
story about appetites, both for love
and food, EatDn‘nIt Man Woman is
about a man who loses his daughters,
one by one, to suitors, until his own
life takes an unexpected turn. Light
and sensual, Lee proves he is amaster
at capturing romance, as evident in
his most recent film, Sense and Sen
sibill‘ry.

Virtuosity

Vtrtuosity is a solid action/mys—
rerypropelled mostly by the strength
of performances from Denzel Wash-
ington and Russell Crowe as the vil—
lain. Set in the near future. scientists
create an artificial intelligence from
a composite of characteristics from
serial killers, which they test against
conVicts. Washington happens to be
one of those convrcrs, and when the
program escapes and takes on a body

made from silicon, he is released to
hunt it down. vi-ttuosity also lea<
tures some high tech special errects,
includingasenuencehasedinvirtual
reality.

The Indian in the Cupboard

The Indian in the Cupboard is
too easily passed offns merely a chil-
dren’s movie, when at its core it is a
very adult mDVie about our notions
of trust and responsibility, What is
childish about it is the magical sense
of innocence and ivonder invoked,
77re Indian in the Cupboard comes
from the capable hands of Frank 02
(otMuppet tame). It's the story are
young boy, Omri, who discovers he
can bring his toys to life with the aid
ofa magic cupboard, Through this,
he befriends a tiny Iroquois brave,
Little Bear, who becomes a valuable
ally as Omti begins the growing-up
process. 77ie Indian in the Cupboard
offers more evrdence that some of
the best films being made today are
so—called “kids’ movies "

Cultural film series:
The Picasso Mystery

A unique documentary on the
artistic process, The Picasso Mystery

ating, eliminating and revrsing until
the ﬁnished work is achieved. Win»

Are you alone in
your loneliness?

NANCY TAYLOR
STAFF WRITER

No matter who you talk to on
the Grinnell campus, it seems as if
the dating scene here is a source ora
great deal ortnistration. Quite a toy
Grinnellians assert that there is no
casual dating at Grinnell. Instead
people will, many times, end up
being either just friends with each
other, or involved in a serious rela—
tionship. There seems to be very
littlemiddlegroundfordatingonrhe
orinnell campus.

Many students that were spoken
to in regards to the issue either did
not wanr to talk about their dating
experiencessineetomingtocollege,
oriftheytalkedabourdaringathin»
nell, did not want to be identified.
This appears to generally reﬂect a
discomfortamongmanythnnellstu—
dents about the issue. The question
that has been posed to me in the past
week is whether Grinnell even has a
dating scene: or is it really even
necessary for people on campus to
date!

One Gtinnell senior said that
she was amazed by the dating scene
when she went off campus last year.
She felt as iftl-ie people in the Couw
try where she was studying actually
apporached dating in anotmal man—
ner. People went out together and
approached relationships in a casual
way, instead of needing to immedi-
ately become part ofa couple. There
appears to be a certain mannet in

which “courting” is approached at
Grinnell. There is always the ever
popular "I talked to him overs—mail
twice today‘" Option. Dinner at
Cowles “Say 5:302" is also a way or
cementingone’s relationship expec-
tations. And when she leavesa mes—
sage on your board it must mean that
something is happening.

The higgest impediment to ca—
sual dating at Grinncll appears to be
that many people are aware preach
other on some level A junior told
me that the only way to improve
dating on campus would be (0 take
away that element orramiliarity that
people have with one another at
Grinnell, and who wants to do that?
Another problem is that the ever—
present “Gtinnell Gossip Mill" is in
full mode ifyou are even seen occa—
sionally with anyone who could be a
potential signiﬁcant other, Because
Grinnell is a small campus, it is
difficult for some people to casually
date when there are not that many
people to choose from. When you
meetsomeone that youllke you might
as well stick with them Another
studentdescribedGrimiellas“asmall
fish bowl" where one's ODUDnS are
just not great. People seem to find
each other in class, organizations,
and in sports. A few couples have
formed during swim practice and IV
prayer meetings Yet some people
complain that they have not found
anybody worth hung at Grinnell.

if you have found that Grinnell
is a dating goldmine then give me a
call and we will discuss it overdinner
at Cowles sometime.
