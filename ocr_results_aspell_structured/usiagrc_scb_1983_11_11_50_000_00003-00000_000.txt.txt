Liberal Education Never Ends

Speaking with Senior Citizen Auditors

by Susan Sink

Grinnell is a college fortunate enough to
have two senior classes. The larger group
oi seniors, the group we are most iamiliar
with, are distinguished from other
students by their confidence on campus
and anxiety about their future lives. The
other “senior class" consists ol a group of
residents at the Mayﬂower Home.

These seniors are not uptight about mar
jors or iuture financial security, but they
share with other students a desire to learn,
Since they are seldomly seen at dances or
hangouts like the Pub and the Forum,
many of you may not have had the chance
to meet them. Let me introduce, then,
three of Grinnell's little known and
iascinating seniors: Eva Pring. Frances
Eddy, and Mary Rex.

Eva Pring is the president oi the
Mayﬂower Resident’s Association as
well as a student at Grinnell. Throughout
her lile she has been active as a Latin and
English teacher in the Chicago area and in
Bloomington, 1nd, where she received two
degrees from lndiana University. While
completing graduate study at Nor-
thwestern University, she worked with the
YWCA in Chicago placing women in jobs
during World War n, she has a great in-
terest in women and their place in the

tection in case they ever have to be alone
and support themselves,

Eva is auditingrclasses at Grinnell for
reasons other than a desire for iinancial
security. She is auditing because it is “an
interesting, available, and worthwhile
thing to do.” Her philosophy is that “as
long as you live, you should keep
learning.” So as soon as due program

started last iall semester under the in-
itiative and guidance oi Protessor oi
Physics Beryl Clotielter, Eva sat in on a
European History class. Presently, she is
in an Urban Studies course. she has found
that her experiences living and working in
Chicago and teaching and counseling in a
girls’ school in Turkey have given her a
broader and more personal appreciation of
the material. Miss Pring has been
challenged by the reading and ieels Grin-
nell still lives up to the excellent reputation
it had aiter World War 11 when she was ad-
vising high school students in Oak Brook,
ill.

Miss Frances Eddy, a graduate oi
Oberlin College and a Chicago seminary

'school, has audited three courses in the

two years oi the program. Last fall she
audited an anthropology course and Music
of Asia and she is presently auditing
Philosophy of Language. These choices
reflect her interest in other cultures. Like
Miss Fring, Miss Eddy worked in Turkey
as a missionary before retiring to Grinnell.

Miss Eddy was impressed by the variety
of courses offered at Grinnell. She feels
this reﬂects a positive shift towards a
more well-rounded curriculum than the
one that existed at Oberlln when she was a
full-time student She remarked that col-
leges were at that time “too single»
minded" and that the lack of study outside
of the student's major discipline closed off
job opportunities. she graduated during
the tinal years oi the Depression. when
teaching openings were almost non-

existent, and found that her English major .

left her unprepared to do anything else,

Miss Eddy was also impressed by stu
dent participation in classes at Grinnell,
Miss Eddy realizes the importance of
education item a philosophical standpoint
as well as an economic one. She thinks a
liberal arts education is important
because it “makes life far more in
teresting ior you it you have something up
there (in your mind) to interpretand enjoy
it with." This attitude holds especially for
women, because “an educated woman
copes with the world better" and is likely
to have a more interesting and symr
pathetic relationship with her husband
than an uneducated woman.

Miss Mary Rex is an extra-special
“senior." She is returning to the Grinnell
classroom iiity years aiter her graduation
irom here, Throughout the interview she
displayed a very “Grinnellian” attitude in
her comments on segregation and the need
ior sensitivity regarding people who are
diiierent with respect to sex, color, age, or
even dress. As a 1833 alumnus, one oi the
“depression kids", she attended college in
hope oi getting a job directly aiterward
and paying on her debt.

. Rex has strayed iarthest of the three
women from her previous major, Botany
and Biology, to a Poltical Science course
entitled “Politics in Congress." Her in-
terest in the subject lies in her belief that
retired people need to continue to be ac-
tive, “live life to the fullest,” and stay
aware oi what is taking place in the world.
She was impressed by the degree to which
students realize their place in society and
also their ability to act maturely on the
issues they are dealing with in class.

She remarked that on campus today
there is “an openness that I think is
beautiful,” Miss Rex attributes that open-
ness to greater class participation and to
the atmosphere on campus that' en-
courages “freedom of expression." She
stressed the need to “act on this expres-
sion,” and the importance oi student par
ticipation “in a government that needs
their opinion,”

The conversation turned to sentimental
reminiscing about the Grinnell oi the thir-
ties, Miss Rex‘s iondest memories are oi
Herrick chapel and the role it played in

[Va Pring

her college liie. she expressed a hope that
students value Herrick and all that passes
in it: the speakers and the music oi iellow
students, professors, and proiassionals,
she concedes that the absence ot the
Forum, or any building like it, in addition
to the bad economic situation of the time,
heightened her memories of ”the beautilul

things associated with it [Herrick]." The
bad economic situation also contributed to
the loyalty of her class to Grinnell as an in-
stitution, and she admires the closeness
between Grinnell students today and their
loyalty to the class and character of the
student body.

All three women made some similar
observations about the college, They all
ieel challenged by the classes and the
readings. They all expressed an apprecia-
tion for the excellent library iacilities and
absorbing reading material. None oi them
ieel intimidated in class discusions. At
the same time, they are all very conscious
oi not monopolizing the students' or pro
fessor’s time inside or outside oi class and

enthusiastic about class this semester
(Eva Pring was carrying her second,
already halHilled notebook with her). The
influence of the ideas dealt with in class on
their thinking could be clearly seen from
Mary Rex's coniident comments on par-
ticipation in the government, to Eva
Pring's descriptions of her lite in Chicago
after World War II. Each of these women
still has Very much to offer the world and
we should appreciate the opportunity to
have them involved so closely with the
campus community.

It is worthwhile to note that these
women, active throughout the world as
social workers, physical therapists,
educators, and missionaries chose Grin-
nell as the town to settle in after retire-
ment. Each one stated that the presence of
the College, with its many opportunities
ior the elderly, cultural events: and the
“fascinating campus of people from all
over the world," influenced their decision
of where to settle.

Grinnell College should be proud of all it
has done by opening its doors to these
fascinating seniors, By making nieni ieel
welcome, the College has accomplished
much more than simply challenging these
special students' thinking. The senior
citizens in the auditing program and those
involved with students in other ways have
been challenged to participate in the
breaking down of barriers between youth
and the aged in our quickly changing socie-

ty.
