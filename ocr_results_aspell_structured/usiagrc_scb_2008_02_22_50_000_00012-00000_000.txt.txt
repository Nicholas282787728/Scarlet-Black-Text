College has taken a lot ot‘rny prirury. I've had to
share rooms, study spttccs, kimhcns. But lately lye
been lamenting . pcciﬁc pr my college dorm life
has deprived me at... politely . tin . I don't like to
flirt around other people, in public sinlations, etc.
The only real polite place to l‘nrt is on the toilet, .rnrl
now because ofdorm life, I can't even flirt in pence
in the bathroom,

I hate it.
