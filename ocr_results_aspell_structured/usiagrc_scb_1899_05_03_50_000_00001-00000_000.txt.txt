New Series.

Grinnell 307Ames 2.

It was with some misgivings as
to the outcome of the game that
the Grinnell nine left for Amcs
last Saturday morning to meet the
oft times formidable “Agricul-
turalists,” but the result of the
game shorvs that their tears were
in vain. It was a fair day with
no rain to stop thegamc, yet when
the seventh inning was completed
and Grinnell had the lead by
twentyrcight scores, the Arnes ag—
grcgation gave up all hopes and
permitted our boys to leave in or.
der that they might riot miss their
train. At the end of the ﬁrst inr
nirrg when Ames had made her
two runs and Grinnell had failed
to reach ﬁrst base in safety, things
looked dubious for tile wearers of
the scarlet and black, but (rum
that time on the spectators could
not help but see that the Visitors
had every 'rhlng their own way.
in fact the work at our nine was
fast and with but a law exceptions
they all played an errcrlcss game.
The I. S. C. boys on the other
hand, besides showing lack ot
practice, were unable to ﬁnd airy
one pitcher who was capable or
deceiving his opponents.

The game began with Grinnell
at the bat. Fisk went out on a
long ﬂy to right ﬁeld, and Clark
thinking it was all an accident,
hit another into the satire garden
only to ﬁnd the catch duplicated
Higgs preferred to try lett ﬁeld
but he was lrkewisc disappointed,
1n the last halt ot the inning
Hooker walked to ﬁrst and stole
second. Shea hit the ball to the
inﬁeld and arrived at ﬁrst while
Lindsay and Clark were trying
to run down Hooker between
second and third. They failed
however and on Clark’s \vlld throw
to second to head off Shea, both
tnen scored, Captain Higgs their
began to twirl the ball somewhat
faster and Malcolm and Snoggins
both tailed th ﬁnd the sphere.
Smith ended the inning by (lying
out to Clark.

In the second inning Taft and
Wheeler fanned the bl'eczcs while
Lindsay gets his base on balls,
steals second and third and canters
homcon “Coggie's” hit, who like
wise scores on ovelthrows to sec-
ond and third. Herr then ﬁnds

scores on a passed ball. Doc gets
to ﬁrst on three strikes but is lelt
on sccund when Fisk flys out to
left ﬁcld. In the second half,
Sexton goes out on an inﬁeld hit,
Curtis walks Lind Overbarrgh hits
to “Cog” who mulls: then Clar
hits to Higgs who throws him out
at ﬁrst; \Vhecler prevents Curtis
from making home by a swift
throw to Taft. and Taft in turn
throws Ovcl'baugll out to Clark,
thns ending beautiirrl triple
play.

In the next inning, Clark hits
the hall in the direction of left
ﬁeld and does not stop until he
has reached third; from there he
reaches home on a hit by Tait
l-liggs, Lindsay and Wheeler all
go outou inﬁeld hits. For], .
C. I’lookcr strikes out; Shea ﬁles
out to Coggeshall; \lIalcolin gets
ﬁrst on Frsk‘. error but tiles on
second, when Snoggins makes
three irtcliectual pa 5 at the ball.

In the tour-th inning Coggeshilll
gets to second on an error by cen»
ter ﬁelder, steals third and makes
home platoon a single by Herr,
Doc strikes out. Fisk a
sacriﬁce hit which lets Herr
score. Clark by two wild throws
and a steal arrives at third and
goes Ironic when the third base
man missed Hiqgs’ llOliinCl'. The
”Captain" in t -u scores when the
center ﬁelder drops Talt's lly.
Lindsay makes the third out by a
ﬂy to Hooker. For Amos Smith
made a ltit but was caught when
tl'yingto steal second. Sexton
tans and Curtis hits to “lack” who
threw him out at ﬁrst.

In the ﬁlth inning Wheeler and
Coggcshnll l'or Grlllllelland Over-
baugh tor Anrcs get singles but
no one rs able to make the round
of the bases.

In the sixth inning the Griunell
boys grieving because they were
unable to take part in the home
ﬁeld meet had a meet oi their own
with numerous dashes and runs.
. l.\tceu runs in all were tabulated,
Doe and Coggeshall making otle
apiece, wllile each of the others
made two scores, The errors on
the part of the Arms nine were
numerous and costly, but at the
satire time the heavy hitting ac-
counted (or many of the scores.
The three I. S. C. men who come
to bat in their hall ol the sixth in-

a

makes

to offset the two Amcs secured in

Second Presentation OF the
Greek Play.

A second per-tormance or the
Return ot Odysseus was given at
the Rand Gymnasium Saturday
night. As a whole the presenta»
tiou was superior to that of Friday
night, owing to the greater conﬁ-
dence of the actors in themselves.
The audience. though notas large
as that of the previous night. gave
most sympathetic attention to the
play.

The presentation ot this adapr
tation of the Ody/mgr to a Grinnell
audience is particularly notewor-
thy in view of the fact that that is
in reality the ﬁrst play in the orig
irral Greek ever given west of the
Mississippi River. The crime
ct Sophocles, grven her-e some
years ago, was grven in English
tlanslution, and hence in the full-
cst sense was not a Greek play.

The junior class deserve the
warmest praise for their courage
in bringing Miss Barrows here
and carrying to successrul com-

pletion so difﬁcult an undertaking.

By a recent appropriation, the
University of Wisconsin receives

ing, $35,000 for anew building at

the same {arm—15X.

The Senior Collegiates have de-
cided to present a mammoth clock
to the 'Vaisity as their class gift.
Arrangements tor the class play,
“In Gay Bohemia,”are aboutcom-
pletcd and its srrcccsstul prCsentn~
tion at some time during com-
mencement week, is assured.—
