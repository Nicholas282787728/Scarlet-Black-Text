SALT II Negotiator calls Star Wars 3.

:“Hair-brained” idea

‘4 by Scott Hildula
Former arms control negotiator Paul
, Warnke says President Reagan's “Star

Wars" defense concept is little more
ithan a loyalty test to see which ad

ministration Stallers will back the idea,
‘ Warnke. who headed the U.S. team in
Athe SALT II talks under PreSldenl Jimr

my Carter. told a tilled Herrick chapel
Iand a nuclear weapons class Tuesday

that current arms talks in Geneva are
.“at the crossroads” and lacking real

leadership lrom the United States.

‘ “President Reagan has to show that

he's a good leader as well as a great
lcommunicator.” Warnke said “He
,hasn't done that yet."

Warnke said the current American

‘nnegotiating team is drifting and

leaderless ”with no clear signal coming
‘lrom Washington.” In contrast, he Said.

the Soviet delegation has a clear Chain
'Df command from Moscow.

He said an agreement is essential
because no’signilicant action has been
plaken in the area since June of 1979. The
current arms control agreements are

very iragilo. he said

Addressing the “Star Wars" concept.
Warnke said that prior to Reagan's
strategic dotenso inititaivc spccch.
"there probably weren't more than to
people who thought it was anything but
a hairrbrained idea.”

"Since then. the president has made
it a test oi loyalty.” he said.

Warnke said Reagan's “Star Wars"
dream isn‘t such a bad idea as long as
only research is lunded and not
development and deployment. since
anti»ballistic misslc systems are cnsily
overwhelmed.

The problem with the concept, he
said. is “Star Wars” has evolved irom
“stardust and moonbeam to the great
pork barrel in the sky" as people jump
on the band wagon to take advantage ot
the money being thrown around

The irony oi the situation, said Ware
nice. is "Star Wars" |S essentially an
ABM system, one that the United States
convinced the Soviets was bad idea in
the past.

Warnkc said it is not surprising the
Soviets don't like the proposal. Such a
system, he Said, could potentially allow
the United States to wipe out the Sovie-
tyintercontinental ballistic misslc
lurces and still have a us. arsenal
i-cady ior a iirst-strikc attack.

Building ally type oi dcicnsivc
system bciorc working on serious otfen~
sivc weapons limits just leads to an ac-
celeratcd arms race. Warnke said.

Wal'nke sees excellent propsccts ior
somc typc oi agreement iollowing a
summit conicrcnce between Reagan
and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev

Gorbachev's probability or leading
the Soviet Union into theI let Century
should make him amenable to being
“an architect" oi iuture peace. Warnkc
said.

"I'd like to see a summit meeting
where the two charmcrs get together
mid try to oulrcharm each other,“ he
said.

SEA gives detailed divestment proposal
to Trustees Today

‘hy Kenneth Forrester
b Coinciding with the Board of
Trustees' annual spring meeting, the
oStudents to End Apartheid have sub
mitted a new and revised proposal ior
>partial divestiture of the college‘s
capital irom companies operating in
’South Africa.
Quoting Bishlp Desmond Tutu e “We
don't want Apartheid liberalized. We
nwant is dismantled, You can't improve
something that is intrinsically evil,” *
‘The SEA has come up with a plan that
goo-author Chris Karis calls “a much
more comprehensive proposal tor
~divestment that examines the moral
immplications oi investment in Saudi
’Alrica.
Calling for limited divestiture, the
" proposal centers around a criterion that
reads: “Grinnell College shall only ins
vest in securities of corporations which
'are annually evaluated as being in the
‘most advanced category of Sullivan AC-
cords compliance and which do not pro-
ivide strategic or technological support

to the Republic of South Africa.

Under the guidelines set up by the
proposal, there would not have to be
any change in investments with come
panies that either complied with the
Sullivan accords, (or which there was
an Insufficient iniormations, or which
had to submit a Sullivan Accord proxy.

The only investments that would have
to be divested would be those with com-
panies that had either failed to sign the
Sullivan Accords, those that had failed
to comply with the Sullivan Accords, or
those that had either strategic or
technological involvement in South
Africa.

For Grinnell College approximately
20% of the total endowment is invested
in corporations operating within South
Africa. Approximately threerlnurths oi
this is in violation oi the proposal's in-
vestment criteria. which means that
331594.570 ot the college's holdings
would have to be divested.

Addressing the issue oi whether or

not the college could afford to do this.
the proposal points to Michigan smte
Univeristy and the University of
Wisconsm. Both of these schools. in
1973. were successiul in plans similar to
those proposed at Grinncll:

Chrls Karis, when asked whether the
college would lose money. Said, “it
depends on. literally. the institution
that is divesting, but the beneﬁts far
outweigh the cots." He added, “Grins
nell College’s investment policies are so
dynamic and successiul they have an
excellent chance or not losing money "

In showing student support, the pro»
posal points to the recent passage of an
all campus reierenduln opposing apar-
theid by a six-throne margin (4354“. it
also points to the fact that Students to
End Apartheid is the oldest student aCr
tlvist group on campus. having actively

tccii years.
