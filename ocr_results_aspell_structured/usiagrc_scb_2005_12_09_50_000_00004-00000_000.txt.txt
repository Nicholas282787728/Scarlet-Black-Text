Fight for your life: War and penguins

War poets, Ukranians selling guns to fuel foreign skirmishes and penguins making babies in inhospitable Antarctica

MOVIE TIMES

Voices in Wartime (unrated)

Poetry and war may seem entirely dissimilar. one
doles out refined beauty, while the other deals in raw
suffering. Yet Vaiier in Willow presents them as nams
ml partners, and it deﬁnitely makes a convincing case.
According to this film, poetry artistically presents the
human responses to war better than any other literary
form.

The film attempts to get at what war is, how we
experience it and how we respond to it, It features
children,poets,academics,authors,soldiers,politicians
and lay people in both antiquated and contemporary
eras responding to war. Despite the disappointing abs
scncc of Ginsburg and Komunyakaa, Saul Williams
and others provided some excellent readings.The film
describes the evolution of war poetry, beginning with
Till Iliad and cnding with the contemporary shift
from Romanticism to popular unt'rwur sentiments.

Soldiers and others who participated in wars may
find works by poets and authors to be somewhat
skewed and irrelevant. The film reconciles this qualm
by highlighting the war poet, both a soldier and a
writer. Poets such as Wilfred Owen wrote poetry
while in the ﬁeld or after returning, They could he
poetic while knowing wars ramiﬁcations ﬁrsthand.

I appreciated the holistic approach of the film.
The him not only centered on an American response
to war, but also featured poets and residents of Iraq,
Great Britain, India and other nations, The poets of
Iraq were particularly interesting, as one of the poets
defended Hussein’s regime while the other alluded to
that government's destruction ofpoetry.

Because it presents poets as just as knowledge-
able as actual soldiers, the film is not very convincing,
despite the beautiful language it cvckcs. Perhaps the
world needs another Wilfred Owen, a soldier who
can write as eloquently as any other poet.

Lord of War (R)

Frankly, there’s nowhere to go but up for Nicolrs
Cage. After last year's performance in worsrsmovies
ever candidate animm/ TrIaSIArt, Cage has turned
himself around by acting as an internatroncl arms
dealer in Lord of War. Directed by Andrew Niccol,
this film is incredibly entertaining when it's an act
non-packed satire on politics and incredibly dull
when it isn't.

cage plays Yuri orlov, a Ukrainian immigrant
who decides that selling guns on the black mar
ket is infinitely more exciting than a deadrend job
at his parents’ holesinstheswall borscht restaurant.
Yuri's brother Vitali (Jared Leto) becomes his busir
ness partner, and they embark on a whirlwind tour
through numerous continents, making small talk with

dictators, evading police and doing more coke than a
human being probably should, all while making pretty
good money supporting foreign wars. Cnge’s promis
nenr narrative adds both a sense ofintclligcnce to the
movie and depth to his character. Yuri approaches
brutal dictators and potential ethical issues with an
amoral, toughsguy mentality, and his narrative en~
hances these scenes.

Unfortunately, the action dies after about half
an hour, and Yuri's conscience stops the movie right
on its tracks. He marries his lifelong crush (Bridget
Moynahan) and tries to cover up his real job.Thank»
fully, the fall of the USSR and violent African civil
wars resuscitate the film and bring Yuri back into ac
cion,with good cop Ethan Hawkc on his tail.

Niccol puts an impressive spin on the war game
The film treats guns not is killing machines, but raths
er as just another way to make money The movie’s
opening credits detail the life ofa bullet as a product,
from assembly line to enemy hands and into the head
of a combatant Cagc’s character dcliberatcly avoids
taking sides in any ofhis deals, merely selling for the
money and not caring about the end result. Niccol
shows how many people treat guns as proﬁt makers
without seeing the death that inevitably results from
them.

Louie/’Wal is a war movie that should have never
deviated from its roots, but if we have to trade a half
hour offamily blather for an hour ofdark humor and
action, so be It, Despite its drawbacks, this film may
have very well saved Nicholas cage from bad—movie
purgatory

March of the Penguins (G)

Antarctica is an inhospitable place, but Emperor
penguins call it home. French director Luc lacquer t
documented the reproductive habits of these link
mals and showed how“in the harshest place on earth,
love finds a wuy."This movie was the surprise hit of
the summer, receiving more pmisc, press and money
than traditionally successful actionsoriented summer
films.

A silent documentary with minimal music in its
original release in France, Jacquet added narration
by Morgrn Freeman for its American release. Freer
man offers interesting facts at times, but he can also
be overly sappy and sound like a narrator on a bad
Animal Planet show.

But the real stars of the film are the penguins.
Full ofbaby penguins, waddling parents and plenty of
snow storms, the story details the basic “circle oflife”
scenario typical to nature shows. The film is devoid
ofany ln-deprh scientiﬁc analysis, resulting in some
thing more Disney than Darwin.

Nonetheless, the cinematic and artistic qualities of
this film are far rbovc anything that you will ever see
on a nature channelThc widesscrccn presentation of
Antarctica is reason enough to go and see this film,
not to mention the penguins. And while the story
may be blatant penguin propaganda, it can hit you in
all the righrplaces, and' in the and, its that quality that
makes Mart/1 off/I: Peiigllim a truly effective film,
