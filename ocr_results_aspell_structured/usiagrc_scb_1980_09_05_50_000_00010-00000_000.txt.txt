Bliss in Grinnell

Perhaps it is too early in the year tor
this, but I thought I’d better get word
out beiore you go sobbing to your poor,

. overworked s.A,s that you just cannot

. TAKE it here any longer. Ofcuurse, for

. the most part, you will continue to take
it, even beyond what you consider the
breaking point, it lor no other reason
than that you've been raised believing

.that you need a degree But you don’t
have toithere are numerous ways to

~ the “Grinnell Experience,” Although it

.is possible for some (I would assume),

seem to matter much to the large
populations 01 Preps, Jocks, JAPs, and
all those other stereotypical collegiaies
who are lound in quite watered-down
versions here. (They have to be iairly
intelligent and Willing to live in Grin-
nell, Iowa—which weeds out the ex-
tremes of any classification, except
perhaps the Earthies.) The social life,
though seemingly abundant, tends to be
beers and iraternity/sorority-oriented,
Jocks are virtual ,gods. People lock
their doors a 207minute trek to
class-in good weathei-eis not unusual.

Of course, for the the most pa’ t, you will
continue to take it, even beyond what you

consider the breaking point, if‘for no other
reason than that you've been raised
believing that you need a degree

relying on Grinnell's merits {or this
procedure has failed to work for me. In
accordance with the Old grass-is-
alwaysgreener theory, the best method
is to leave Grinnell.

Gomg home usually helps, especially
if you are iuily exercising your cola
legiate freedom at Grinnell. It is
preferable, (or this treatment, to have
overprotectlve and/or nagging parents
Iawaiting you, and perhaps some annoy-
:ing younger siblings ior added eliect.
; (If you have neither oi these, you might
-.wish to adopt some for this purpose or
'resort to another method.) When you
leave the house in the evening, parents
will almost invariably ask you where

you are going, with whom, and for how '

long. No matter how many times you
remind your parents that you can take
care of yourself, they will persist in
believing that they can do a better yob
Di it. While at home, be sure to visit a
friend who still lives with his/her
parents and either a) is still in high
'school, b) is not in school at all, or c) at
tends a community college. Conver
niently, summer breaks have been
created especially lor the purpose oi gas
ing home and seeing what you were
missingior, hopclully, what you were
not missing.

~ A second alternative (especially
irseiul ior those who believe they are
merely disenchanted With small-
iiberal-artscollege life) is to visit a big
state school. The tremendous knots and
tangles oi red tape are a shuck to the
system. But the bureaucracy and the
students-as-numbers system don’t
