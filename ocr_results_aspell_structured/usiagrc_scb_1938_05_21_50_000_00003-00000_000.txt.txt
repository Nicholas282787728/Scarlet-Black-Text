the play there was evidence of
Mrs. Sara Sherman Pryor's usual
careful stage direction.

The second play 01' the eve-
ning, the first public performance
of “Marie Antoinette" by Harry
Duncan, ’33, was on the whole
well done. Duncan’s verse was
read especially well by Margaret
Currier, who took the part of the
queen. One felt, however, that
here was a play that might well
tax the resources of professional
actors.

some of the details were a lit-
tle troublesome. Why, for in~
stance, should a priest wear a
cassock decorated with red? Why
could not the eighteenth century
uniform worn by Wendell Butler
seem a little less obviously home
made? Illusion is important in
the poetic drama, and it can easily
be dispelled by small incongruous
details Surely if a Swedish count
can spend half a million francs to
ransom a queen, he can afford a
respeetahle hand-bag.
