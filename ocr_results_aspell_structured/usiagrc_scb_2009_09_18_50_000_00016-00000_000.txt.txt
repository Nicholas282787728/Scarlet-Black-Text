September 7, 1979

Disco music and all the manifesta-
tions of the disco industry pervade in—
evitable. One can no longer go out in
public without hearing a blast of “Freak
Out” or “Join the Navy." Even on re-
mote beaches there seems always to be
one disco fanatic who carries with him
some sort of portable machine which
blast out the mindless tempo of disco.
1 hate it. Holding my ears from this
frenzied rattatetat, I am only left to
ask, “Will they ever leave us alone?”

Please do not poop in Noyce

I know that the efficiency ﬂush toilets in Noyce
are probably very Euro-:nvironmentol-energy
conserving and make us look progressive. What
is not so progressive are the massive skid-
marks left in the bowl from stressed out people
hiwing bowel movements too intense for those
little half-full toilets. I could not ﬁnd a single

‘ . one Without smins today, and that is a pretty

typical case. Its not your fault,‘ In fact i am very
sympathetic to the poor soul knowingly leaving
behind a big brown rrnii "Iii: wasteful but oh—

so satisfying water pressure just doesn't ﬂow

to those toilets. But please, just consider that

when you are wannsring campus looking for an
emergency poop pit stop

An egregious error inithe S&B

In the 9/4 issue of the 8&3, your map on im‘
pommt places to go in Grinnell committed the
gravest of errors by leaving our A&M Cafe! How
else will the ﬁrs: years know where to get the ab
solute best hangover food in the world while be
ing able to experience (he unique decor that com~
binds Hannibal Lecter’s cage and an all-season
Christmas nee»? Seriously kids if you haven’t
gone to A8<M on the comer of State Street and
Fourth (right past Suite Street Bar and the bowl-
ing Riley) between the hours 0% a; m and 2 p. m. ,
you are missing out And no, 1 donr work for

them with peppers and onions—you won’t regret _

Egregiaus error, continued . . .

Ir was a joy to read in Random Rams of
Ernnn Peterson's nnnoynnoe with the ascmnn-
ric “like."I have erusaded for years against this
juvenile verbal ric, but it is especially gratifying
to have an ally among the users' own age-mates,

“Out of the mouth of babes and sucldings
hast thou ordained men because of thine en-
emies, that rhou "lightest still the enemy and the
avenger.”
