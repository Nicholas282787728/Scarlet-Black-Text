Two comedy classics head the bill for this
weekend’s lilms. The first is the film that
launched Dustin Hoffman's film career —
The Graduate (1967, 105 min). Attempting
to be a shrewd social commentary, the
film deals with an aimless young product
of suburbia (Dustin Hoffman) and his uni-
que protest against society. His way 01
rebelling is to be seduced by one of his
father’s friends, Mrs. Robinson (Anne
Bancroft) ; ”I think you‘re the most attrac-
tive of all my parent’s friends.” Their .
scenes together are quite amusing and, at
the same time, done with comparative
frankness in terms of sex: the hotel scene
is a classic. Unfortunately, Mrs. Robinson
has an equally attractive daughter
(Katharine Ross) whom Benjamin falls in
love with to Complicate things. Further,
her parents do not take kindly to his ad-
vances. But by the end, the audience is
rooting for the good guys to overcome the
“establishment” and individualism will
triumph, a very sixtish sort of thing. The
photography is beautiful; the script (by
Buck Henry and Calder Willingham) is
fine, and the direction Won Mike Nichols
an Academy Award. The acting is impec-
cable. each character Capturing the bitter
absurdity of their situation. And of course
there is the now well-known soundtrack by
Simon and Garfunkel which adds to the
[low of the film. Fifteen years after its
release, this film may seem dated, but it
can still provide a fine evening‘s entertains
ment,

The other film is one of the classic film
comedies of all time, Mr. Roberts (1955,
123 min. i. This topnotch film adapted from
the Broadway show deals with the navy
supply vessel, the nelucant, and its motley
crew. Henry Fonda, repeating his Broad-
way success, gives a solid, straightforv
ward Characterization in the title role, As
Roberts, he is eager to be transferred to
the lighting zone rather than to remain on
the cargo ship, and he mourns the fact that
he's missing the entire war. Jack Lemmon
{AA} steals the film as Ensign Pulver, a
ramhunctious and opportunistic oddball
who never leaves his berth. Then there's
James Cagney as the petty captain whose
most prized possession is his potted palm
tree. These mens’ antics include abusing
ﬁlls same palm tree, sneaking some navy
nurses on board, and causing the entire
vessel to be bathed in soapsuds. Although
often underrated, it is Fonda's perfor-
mance which gives the picture power and
resonance. The film's initial popularity
was because of its fine entertainment and
its timing. The film offered a romantic vi-
sion of combat and a less complicated
lifestyle that had ended with the war, Yet
underneath the light comedy, there is
something dark and frightening about the
concept; Mr. Roberts’ perpetual desire to
rid himself of the apathy and boredom he
experiences ends in sudden oblivion rather
than the conclusive action he had hoped
for. Another interesting angle in this film
that it captures some of the tone of the

'Max Havelaor'

Max Havelaar is a vivid reconstruction
of an epoch and a way of life based on Ed»
ward Douwes Dekker’s autobiographical
novel oi Dutch and Colonial Java in the
midrmth century. Ranging from the draw-
ing rooms of a Dutch colfee merchant to
the mountains at Java, it tells a story that
in a century and a quarter has lost none of
its beauty or tragedy.

Edward Douwes Dekker (18201887), the
son of a Dutch ship captain, arrived in
Java in 1838. Joining the East India Ser-
vice in 1333, he had risen to the position of
assistant resident at Amboyna, which is in
the Moluccas by 1851. in 1857, Dekker was
transferred to Lebsk, which is in the Ban
trim Residency of Java. Protesting openly
against what he perceived to be me abuses
of the Dutch Colonial Administration, he
was threatened with dismissal. Resigning
his post, he returned to Holland, where he
wrote a series of newspaper articles outlin-
ing his views. These received little notice,
and in 1360 he published his novel, int/en-
ding to bring his views to a wider audience.
In this he was successful; Max Havelnr
was an immediate success. Like the novel,
the film must be understood for what it is:
an indictment, Dekker's viewpoint is
nowhere unbiased, and the film loses none
of the force of his outrage. Likewise, his
sell-portrait is not without gloss.
