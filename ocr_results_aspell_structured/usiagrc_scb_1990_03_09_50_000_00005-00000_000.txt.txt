Variations on a Theme

better example I can think of then
the document The Protocol: of the

maintain ridiculous self serving

senseless hatred, such as the Ku

controlled sexual appetites of the
African American male and the
inherently traitorous nature of
Asians. The Protocols seem some
how different, I am sure this per-
ceived difference is partially be
cause of my own Jewish heritage,
but it is also because of the depth
and the breadth of this work.

The Protocols, for those unfa-
miliar with the yarn. is a story told
as an eyewitness account, of 13,
old. Jewish men meeting at night in
a cemetery in Prague to discuss
their plans to enslave Christianity
and take over the world. It was
written at the turn of the century in
France, and some scholars have
argued that since that time it has
been translated into more languages
then any other written work, with
the exception of the The Bible. It
has been used by almostevery anti-
Semitic movement, from Adolph
Hitler to modem European Neo»
Nazis. WhileI wish that the use of

such drivel would cease, it seems
that this festering malignancy of

BASIG ISSUES

Bush's Promises Falling
Short in Translation

By Evan Zoeckler

That old malaise that periodi-
cally grips our fine Republic has
returned. This time, only George
“Globetrotter" Bush can claim the
credit. The President who brought
us Dan Quayle, “the little brown
ones," and the Wimp Factor now
brings us closer to complete stagna-
tion than ever before.

The cocaine pipeline is fuller
than ever, a nearly a quarter of
young African-American men are
in jail, on parole. or on probation,
and the cities are receiving less
federal aid than any time previ»
ously. Why? Because GeorgeBush
has not been tending to business.
Oh sure, he‘s been lauding the
Poople‘sRepublic of Chinafortheir
ﬁrm “Law ‘n’ Order" stance. and
yes, he accosted Manuel Noriega
and in the process killed hundreds

of innocent Panamanians. But
while he‘s been making a name
for himself abroad. we‘ve not
heard of him improving education
(remember the “Education Presi-
dent"). making our neighbor—
hoods safer (remember Willie
Horton). or pursuing peace. In
fact, Bush's proposed Fiscal Year
1991 Budget calls for increased
spending for the Pentagon!

If we are to deﬁne our post
cold-war agenda, we must do
better than two-bit invasions and
Stealth bombers. We must realize,
finally, that the drug trade is learn
ing attire very fabric of our society.
We can’t juggle the books and fal»
sify the figures. as the Bush Ad
ministration is doing. We must
realize that we are falling fanher
and farther behind the rest of the
world in educating our children

trolled media there minds would be
made free. What is more frightenr
ing is that few people argue against
this clear logical fallacy.

If there is a clandestine effort
going on to keep the American
public from the truth, how is it we
know there even is such a thing as
the Arab-Israeli conflict? Even if
one were to not go to that extreme,
and instead say that there exists a

cabal which only exerts a powerful I
inﬂuence. then how is it that of the‘

line!) articles about the Middle East
on theOp-Ed page ofToday's (Mar.

aboutShamir,oneisexplarninghow
moderate the Arab states are be-
coming, and the third is by the well»
known Palestinian activist, Profes-
sorEdward Said. I submit to you, if
there is a secret society of Jews, it
must be tremendously disorganized
for it is clearly neglecting its ap-
pointed task.

I am not so much ofa dreamer as
to believe that the world is without
those ﬁlled with mindless hatred. I
am, however, deeply hurt by the
fact that no one has risen up to
challenge this mockery. How is it
that people can espouse such drivel
as still go largely unchecked? I
submit that it is because of this lack
of a challenge that this disme
spreads. People should not need to

rise up against a particular hatred;

would agree that we are in deep in
America. This information. like
most, is shielded out and yet com-

folks, America owes a lot of people

we are actually indebted to the
“roller of big cigars" (Citibank

The invutment that other cultures
have made, wittingly or nay. in our

people don’t want money but food,
and maybe an explanation on a full

what people need or deserve are
two very different things, you may

say. Because we all KNOW that

platform ,of restoring
Germany’s pre-l937

Nazi slogan of “Ger

again heard on the

streets of Lerpzi g, where the downfall of Communist
nile began. And Kohl, instead ofrejecting the nation-
alism out of hand, cynically keeps the hopes of these
people alive by way of leaving the border issue to be
decided by a united Germany. in order to improve his
currently somewhat slim chances of gaining a third
term in ofﬁce at the general election this December.
In the lighi of this situation some serious questions
have to be asked about the reuniﬁcation process.
