EXAMINATIONS.

It is required cl all faculty members that final
examinations be given at the end of the semester. Until
the second semester of last year the custom was to hold
two hour exams, but at the close or the second semester
it was decided that three hour exams should be given.
At the time this decision was made there was a suggesr
lion that although the period should be three hours the
material should be for a two hour examination. There
was, however, no specific Yule adopted by the faculty
that this was to be the case. If the professor wished to
give out a set of questions that would require three hours

to answeri he could do so if he thought best.

There has been some complaint among the students
that a few of the proicssors gavc three hour examinations
ilistcud at two hour exams, not understanding tllc fact
that there was no law forbidding such a thing. In one
class there was a small robcllion, not so much ill opposir
tion to the length or the period but that they were
required to take nu examination of any kind. The test
was given and the proicssor made the shiternent that he
gave the exam only because it was a faculty rcquircment
and not hccause he thought it was a fair test of the stile
dellts' knowledge of the work. Perhaps an examination
is not a (air test but it is perhaps the only method by
which the proiessor can obtain a general idea of how

thoroughly a student has done his work, One of Lllc‘

greatest causes of the worry that sprcnds among the
students at cxanli tion time is due to the fact that the
legitimate amount of study has not been done during the
semester, and as a result a desperate endeavor is made
to cover tlic entire course in a week, or as is more often
the case, in a few hours. This is a hopeless and an im»
possible thing to do. The time to study for examinations
is every day of the semester, and when the students re-
alize this, there will be less complaint against exams,
whcthcr they be two hours or three hours,

AMERICAN COURT JUSTIi‘E.

A di'y goods firm was broken into a year ago. and a
valuhblc set of furs, among other things, was stolen. As
police and detectives usually prove too slow, the deal-
ers set to work, found the thieves, and established their
guilt. However, the judgc set a date for u Iurther trial,
and bond was given to the criminals who left the court
room carrying the stolen furs with them.

A year has passed since this happened; there has
been no further trial, the thieves have disappeared, and
the drygoods company has never regained its furs. There
was no need of a further trial, the proof was before the
court, If punishment is to be dealt at all, to be effective
it must immediately iollow the misdemeanor,

it seems that the aim of the lawyers and judges in
our present luw system is to prove a person innocent ev-
en though it is absolutely certain that the accused is
guilty at the crime he is supposed to have committed. It
makes no difiereucc ‘even when the criminal admits that
he is gullty; if the lawyer is a good one, he can prove in
the face oi the facts, that his client is innocent. The law
courts of today have ceased to administer justice; they
have degenerated into debating societies, in which the
team that has the keencst wit, and the anSL obscure, une
derllmlded yet lawful methods of interpreting the law,
wins.

“TL-\T DO YOU THINK OF GIVING

S “TESTER EXAMINATIONS?

Prof. John SnliﬂliI approve of the
present system because semester ex-
aminations act as a clearing house for
the knowledge which each student
has acquired during the semester.

Prof. J. D. StoopsiUnder oul‘ pres-
ent system of education they are
necessary. But if a college has
enough funds, enough instructors
should be hired so that a personal
conference system could be adopted.
Under that system exams would not
be necessary.

Paul D. KnighFThe present sys-
tem should be changed. Semester ex-
aminotions should be given in some
Courses, and not in others. For some
individuals they are necessary, for
others not. In other Words, the de<

cision should rest with the instructor. ‘

Miss Elisa Curtiseb‘or the average
student, semester exams are neces-
sary. They give him a chance to re-
view the entire subject matter or the
course. Above—the—average students
need the review but not the examina—
tions.‘

George Wilson — As things stand
now, the instructors are taking ad
vantage of the three hours given to
write the exam to give a three hour
instead of a two hour test, as they
are supposed to do.

Harold Colbert _ The instructor
should use his judgment in individual
cases.

Clarence Jacobson—Exams are nec-
essary evils in our present system, but
too much emphasis is placed upon
them. If possible, the personal con-
icrence system should take the plucc

 

of the lecture plan, thus making
exams unnecesscr

Buel HermmlaEither the monthly
tests or the finals should be abolishr
ed.

Josephine Noel—Spread the exams
out so that they don’t come all at
once. When they all come in a week,
the shock is too great.

a marvellous adventure, and I wish it

Could be it great success.

"In England 1 have often landed in
trouble over my defense of the Am-
erican prohibition law, and for saying
it might not be a bad thing tor Eng-
land to try it. Last year in a Don-
don club I was hotly attacked by an
author for my statements on the sub-
ject."

Miss Royden will be the next speaks
