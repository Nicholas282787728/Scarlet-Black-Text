The entrance to the Eagles Lodge on 4th Avenue is filled
with eagles an plaques,eagles on riags and eagles on beer steins,
john Edwards made his last stop in Grlnnell before the caucus
htrt Wednesday night, bringing along actor Tim Robbins and

- perfectly exemplifying the two core as iccts or Edwards cams

endorsements rrom minor, random celeb ties.

The Edwards group on campus was the ﬁrst Giinnell presi-

and the ﬁrst to talk about the import

the [Va/tart and listens to talk ladio, veterans and cab dlivels. “I
realize the depth and decency orthe American peopley'he said,
to which a man in the crowd honestly shouted, “Hear hear!"
Robbins, who played “Slave #1" rn a television episode entitled
“Planet of the Slave Girls” before he starred in the Sb/iwr/szk
RtlIt-mpn'an, believes Edwalds is the candidate who will listen to
the opinions ofAmcrica’s working mothers, veterans and school
teachers.

Following Robbins's introduction,
Edwards walked out to the tune ofjohn
Mellancamps “This is our country,"
shaking the hands orrhc working mothers and fathers tliemv

given across Iowa in the past few months—mo emphasis on

the 15 percent threshold.

Then comes the realignment phase, as
shown in Diagram 3, in which individuals
may decide to change their preference. 'niosc
whose candidates did not meet the threshold
may decide to create an uncommitted group,
whose delegates can decide to withold their
preference until the county convention. Oth-
ers may lend their support to a candidate al~
ready meeting the threshold.

Each candidate's group will get a proper
tionate percentage of the 37 total delegates
from Ward 1, who will represent the ward at
the Poweshiek county Convention.

At the end, the caucus will come together
to apportion ,

some with respect to government spending
All the candidates agreed that government
should play a smaller role and taxes should be
lowered. Huckabee, keyes and Representatives
Duncan Hunter and Ron Paul all stated they
are in favor ofa “fair tax," which would abolish
the IRS and create a national sales tax.

Out of all the candidates, Huckzbee an-
swered the questions with the most poise and
collection. He has a way of making words
sound poetic. He said he would be a “CommUs
nicator in Chief"and wanted to see Americans
turn back into the "United People of the Url.i
ed states." senator John McCain answered
each question conﬁdently and calmly as well,
yet seemed a little depressc ,lt looks as if the
campaign trail is taking a lot out of him.

The largest wildcard of the debate was

Keyes, He broke into the debate at one point,
accusing washburn of not giving him enough
questionrime. Most of his points were the
same, all focusing around the moral qualities
ofWashington and the "phonics" who run it.
He never really answered a question, which
prompted Thompson to joke, "I agree with
Alan Keyes’s position on global warming."
For what the debate lacked in heat, it made
up for in substance. There were times when
the candidates did not answer the questions
directly, but most of the debate was full of talk
of reduced government spending, trade poli—
cies and economic incentives designed to lrnt
prove the nation. Iowans still may not be set in
their candidate choices, but after this debate,
they know a little more about their options.

Clinton confusion on student voting needs to end

In a race that becomes tighter as the clock counting down
to the lowa Democratic Caucus ticks away, Senators Hillary
Clinton and Barack Obama are trying to maximize their sup-
porters. With Ohama receiving strong support from college
students, the Clinton campaign has made muddled statements
about outsofsstate participation in the
caucus, at times suggesting that those SL'U‘
dents should not caucus while elsewhere
striking a softer tone.

Sen. Clinton attacked Obama’s cams
paign earlier in the month for encouraging students who do not
claim permanent residence in Iowa to vote in the state. During
a speech in Clear Lake, Iowa, Senator Clinton stated that the
caucus “is a process for Iowans. This needs to be all about lovwr,

News Column

and people who live here, people who pay taxes here."

Enraged by these exclusionary statements, young bloggers
took up the cause of student voters in protest to the senator's
statement. Their point? That students attending schools in
Iowa are, in tact, legally eligible to vote in the state where they
spend nine months of the year. They
should take full adimntage of this op-
portunityto participate in the political
process, Therefore, Obama's encours
agement ofstudtnt to "come back for
the Iowa caucuses and caucus rn your neighborhood" is both
legal and ethical.

Realizing that the backlash against Sen. Clinton‘s coms
ments could potentially harm her standing with the thousands

Julia Bottles

of caucus—going students, her campaign quickly backtrackcd.

In a statement emailed to the blog Future Majority, the cams

paign stated,"The Iowa caucus is so special because it is based

on Iowa values. we believe that every Iowan and every student

who is eligible to caucus should do so and we hope they do."
The campaign was right in going one step further
