Williams on the British perspective

by Flora Wiliitl and Scott llildiila

Grinnell is currently enjoying a rare
opportunity to gain an insight into
British politics. Shirley Williams, presi-
dent oi England‘s Social Democratic
Party. is currently the visiting
Heath Professor,

Williams first started in politics in the
19505 as a student speaker tor the
Labour Party. She has maintained an
active role in British politics ever since.

“i had three elections under my belt
by the time 1 was 22." Williams said.
though she was not elected until 1964.
Her victory was considered somewhat
remarkable as it was not considered to
be a good year ior the Labour Party.

‘I won a seat most people thought we
couldn’t win and 1 held that seat for 20
years," Williams Said

Williams helped found the SDP when
diiferences within the Labour Party's
leadership came to a head in 1979.
Three major points oi disagreement
arose to force the break.

Labour‘s stance oi “hall'rpulllng out
ol NATO." a call ior withdraw] from
the Common Market. and disagree-
ment over the procedure toi- election ol
party leaders all led to the fracture.
The new system oi elections in Labour
would give too much power to the
unions. Williams Sald,

Williams' position as head 01 the SDP
puts her in a position to know and have
an opinion about nearly every aspect at
British, American and world politics.
As co-iounder at a party that ialls bet-
ween Labour on the Leit and Margaret
Thatcher’s Tories on the Righti
Williams is critical of policies
emanating irom both sides

The recent coal miner's strike should
help the SDP, said Williams The elecV
torate didn't like the strike and thought
Thatcher was playing it too tough. she
said.

“Labour is having a falling out over
who is responsible for the strike The
miners also played it stupidly Once
they deClded not to hold a vote. the
union lost a lot oi sympathy irom the
public." Williams said.

The SDF has no difficulty with the
way in which the actual Falkland
Island battle with Argentina was con-
ducted. However, Williams said, her
party would have done things different
ly before and alter the conflict.

“Before the battle we wouldn’t have

withdrawn the naval ships that were in
the South Atlantic between the
Falkland islands and the Argentina
coasti" Williams said. The withdrawl ol
the ships was mlsunderstood'by the
Argentinians to he a retreat irom the
continued British deiense oi the islands.
she said. “ii the ships weren't
Withdrawn. we needn't have had the
war at all."

Following the battle. the SDP iavored
some type oi international settlement oi

the issue. Williams said Contrary to
the wishes oi the ruling pariy.
trusteeship by some iieiiirai third coulir
try was tamed by the SDP.

williains thinks that an emphasis on
conventional weapons is necessary to
counter the Soviet threat in Europe
The Soviets are not likely to risk the
threat oi nuclear war. she s id. but
might be willing to take advantage oi a
weakness in conventional strength.

“if we're going to have this enormous
emphasis on deiciise that we are talk:
ing about, I think it is necessary that we
have more emphasis on the Convene
tional iorces. williams said.

"It ithe Soviet uiiioni has no iiitcn-
tion of having a third world \iar."
williams said, But. she added. "we see
the Soviets as a neurotically deieiisive
power which \iill take anything it is
given it they can get away with it .. like
Afghanistan."

The British are somewhat at a loss as
to why the Americans have gotten so
excited about the situation in
Nicaragua.

Babu on African issues

By Scott liildula

Abdul Rahman Mohamed Babu got a
chance Thursday to “properly thank"
Shirley Williams ior his release irom
prison in im. Babu. iormer minister oi
commerce in the Tanzanian govern
ment, was held without chargeina Dara
eSvSalaam prison from ism-ism. Babu
gained his ireedom largely due to the
eiiorts oi Williams and other liberal ac-
tivists

Williams knows Julius Nyerere.
President ot Tanzania. through their
menitierships in the Catholic institute
oi international Relations and the Pa
blan Society. This gave her an effective
audience to which she could petition tor
the release oi Babu and other political
prisoners.

Babu and williams had met once
beiore during the early 19605. She was
then general secretary oi the Fabian
Society — the Labor Party think-tank »
and he was a rising young political star
in Zanzibar.

Their patiis were not in cross again
until Babu. here last “er under lhe
auspices ot the Rosenlield program.
and Williams. the visiting lleatli Pros
lessor. met in Cowles dining hall over
lunch.

The meeting 01 the two political :ic-
tivists was marked more by the degree
to which williams and Babu agreed on
political issues than by any anticipated
disagreement.

Babu anticipated a more conser-
vative attitude on her part and
Williams probably expected the more
radical socialist of twenty yea go.
