To Be Responsive

When students apply or run for positions within
SGA, or the committee structure of the college
(or even, perhaps, the 5&8), they invariably
promise H though we suspect with quite varying
degrees of sincerity -- to be ”responsive” to
the needs and criticisms of their fellow students.
It is an admirable ideal, but it is too often
neglected early in the year.

This year’s Student Government officials seem,
happily, to have caught the spirit of respon-
siveness; Shelley Floyd, Terry Clifford, and Bob
Meyer are making regular and numerous efforts
to inform students of the actions which are
being taken “for" them and in their names and
to involve them in making important decisions.
Certainly their efforts have done much to bridge
the gap which too often existedin the past between
the "campus elite“ and the average student.

An attitude at one level of Student Government,
however does not automatically transfer to those
at other levels. The 8&8 has learned, in the very
first weeks of its operation this year, that there
may be some students holdingimportantpositions
who regard their positions or organizations as
personal fiefdoms, not responsible to outside
“interference" -- if information gathering is
interference. There is still a reluctancy among
some to truly practice the “openness” that was
to have been the chief virtue of the student power
movement begun several years ago.

Yet today this openness is needed much more
than before; for though a period of rapid change
in social and academic matters seems to have
ended, it has left us with the basic answers to
important long range questions unresolved. How
can we make the new curriculum work? What
should be done about the grading system? How
can we better prepare students fornon-academic
careers? What guidelines should be established
for independent study? If we are to successfully
answer these questions, we must direct our-
selves towards honest and truthful deliberation.
We must keep in mind the best long range inter-
ests of both ourselves and of the college. For
this, we must be “responsive" to each other.
Selection of the at- large student representative
on the new Educational Policy Committee, the
three divisional student representatives, and the
black student representative will, we hope, be
made with this in mind. Let student represenr
tatives at all levels of the college be motivated
by a spirit of honest, open inquiry; so they will
not try to represent only a particular viewpoint
but will weigh carefully the merits of the several
viewpoints that comprise the Grinnellcommunity.

Our Radio Show

This comingMonday night,the SCARLET AND
BLACK will initiate a weekly radio show on 1(ch
devoted to reports and discussion of campus
news. The program, designed as a means to
broaden and inter~relate news published in Fri~
day's newspaper, will bring together reporters,
editors, and guests informally in a kind ofbroad—
cast “newsroom" discussion.

We do not expect the program to be a daring
adventure into the far reaches of experimental
journalism and mass media; it is frankly a copy
of a “Newsroom of the Air" show begun by
KQED-TV (San Francisco) several years ago.
Such an attempt at relating the print to the
broadcast media, the reportingstaffofthe campus
newspaper to its readership, and reported news
to the news makers is nevertheless new at Grins
nell, where "communication” is, it too often
seems, expressed as an ideal more than it is
put into effect.

Mondaywe will discuss the role of the Executive
Council of the Faculty and its relatively new
Policy Committee, and some of the issues and
problems which will be facing the student-faculty-
administration membership of the latter. We
invite you to listen, and to participate through
comments and questions.

“‘Urgé Equity In ~l’hi Beta Kappa

by Steve Grow
During the coming months,
several Grinnellfacultymenr
bcrs face the task of selec-
ting those senior students to
be honored by election to Phi
Beta Kappa. Membership is
traditionally extended to those
who have distinguished ihenr
selves in their academicwork
at Grinnell; typically, the
chapter honors about twelve

per cent of the senior class.
This year the Grinnell chap‘
ter has sci up a committee
to recommend a method ofser
lecting new members. In the
recent past, the sole deter-
miner used to select students
has been the cumulative
gradepoint.

One can argue that using the
gradepoint to judge academic
excellence is not the best of

(hugging On To Victory

by jack Doppelt

It all started calmly enough

on a mountain in Colorado.
But before thc sun came up,
a chugging contest had been
planned and rigorous train-
ing begun. One of the Grin
nnell Guzzlers had Challenged
Tulsa’s answer to teetotall-
ing to a oneon—one, nogulpsr
barred match.

The hometown favorite told
me of the trouble she has
had training. "Every time
I’ve gone to a beer blast this
semester, they’ve run out be-
fore I could get going. Eie
ther there are a lot more
amateur beer drinkers here
this year or the kegs have
only been halfrfilled." But
borh chuggers put their minds
and stomachs to it and got
down to cases.

Hamilton Stein

They were ready. The con-
test was set for last Friday
night at 10:00 p.m. under the
flag pole in front of the F07
rum. A disappointingly sp-
arse crowd gathered. This
could only havc been due to
insufficient publicity, because
the contestants are the tops
in their field.

Fearing reprisals from an
anti-beer sect in the Forum,
there was a slight delayas the
match was transferred to the
other side of central campus
near Herrick Chapel, at more
appropriate spor for this core
monious undertaking. Rules
were clarified. Each contes-
tant was to drink a case of
beer before dawn. The win-
nor would be chosen on poise
and self-control, degree of
hangover, and, of course, the
ability to hold it. The winner
was to receive the Hamilton
Endurance Stein which come
memorates last year's taco
and deviled egg records of
28 and 58 respectively.

Cross Legs

Famed beer enthusiast Bel?
Ch Brewer was on hand to Ch’
ant The Bottle Hymn of the
Pubbers, and the match bee
gan. The contestants sat
crosslegged, facing each oth-

er. Under international rules,
the legs must be crossed so
the contestants know where
to find them later in the mat
ch. The Grinnell Guzzler ope
ened with a fifteenrsecond
gulp to take the early lead.
Some experts claim that slow
and steady wins the race, but
others maintain that this de-
velops into an impossibility.

Halfway

At the siprack mark, the
tide began to turn. There
were signs that the Grinnell
Guzzler was drunk this early
in the match. This ultimate
ly would affect her perfor-
mance, because dancing that
vigorously couldn’t help but
tire her. But it appears that
this was merely strategy be-
cause thereafter ihe Tulsa
Sponge had trouble swallowr
ing, whilc rolling in the grass
In convulsive laughter. It
was a knock—downrdrag-out
battle all the way.

The match concluded ai 2:30
am. in Yonkers Lounge on a
disappointing note. The con-
testants agreed [0 stop after
only two six»packs. Health
reasons were given as the
excuse, but I an only attri-
bute their failures to a lack
of constant training. Thematr
ch terminated in a draw. The
Grinnell Guzzler lost two
points on poise and self-
control and five on hangover,
but because of a 3:30 a.m.
mishap, the Tulsa Sponge lost
seven points in ability-[0*
hold-it. A rematch is in the
planning stages, but both will
have to recuperate and res
train. The rematch may be
open to independent challeng—
ers. But for those who can't
handle the foaming competi-
tion, chugging remains a gr
eat spectator sport. Social
gulpers should talk to your
intramural chairmen.

The names have been With’
held to protect the inebriates.

Faculty Article
Called Insensiiive

To The Editor:

In your September third are
ticle introducing new mem-
bers of the college facultyyou
indicated that Lynn Mather's
primary claim to status in
the college community was her
marital rclationship to Gordon
Mather. Your presentation
seems to us to be a clear exv
ample of the insensitivity
which Women accuse us of
demonstrating toward them.
As Lynn Mather’s coileagies
we Wish to enter a strong ob-
jection to this sort of dis*
crimination.

We realize that you used fa-
culty rank to order your in-
troductions. However, we
wonder if you would have cone
sidercd writing the article
to read:

Lynn Moss Mather has
been appointed Instructor
in Political Science for the
coming academic year, to
replace Mr. Mi [her during
his leave. She holds the
B.A. degree from the Uni-
Versity of California (Los
Angeles) and has a Ph.D.
in process at the Univer-
sity of California (Irvine).

Mather) has beenappoinied

policies; 1 think other factors
should also be taken into ac
count, because the student who
has devoted a great deal of
lime to student government
or to other worthwhile activi~
ties may be unfairly discri'
minated against. Neverthe*
less, the gradcpoint is the ca-
siest indicator to use.
Fair Comparison

If we are to rank students
on grades alone, we should
be sure that the basis ofcomr
paring two students is the
same. The cumulative grade
point average on transcripts
no longer provides a fair ba-
sis for comparison, because
students who have taken many
credit fail courses have an
unfair advantage over those
who have taken letter grades
in all course work.

Letter Grades

The actual letter grades Stur
dents earned are available
to the College, except for the
semester we closed early,
when some of the grading op-
tions did not require the in
structor to submit a letter
grade. Until all students one
rolled thatsemester have gran
duated, it would be necessary
not to consideracademic work
done that semester; but I do
hope Phi Beta Kappa will give
serious thought to electing
membersﬁif they must rely
only on gradesvon the basis
of actual grades earned by
students. it would be more
fair to rank students on the
quality of all their academic
work than to exclude from
consideration work done on the
Credit fail basis.

S 8. B Fails To lisl
Mrs. Mother’s Record

To the Editor:
We would like to correct an
oversight in the article “ ‘14“,
cky Thirteen’ Join Grinnell's
Faculty" (The S h B, Sept-
ember 3). Academic hiSLOr’
ies were listed for the twelve
men, but not for Lynn Ma-
ther. Since Lynn's status as
wife of Gordon Mather does
not constitute a qualification
for teaching political sciel’r
ce, we think it should be
added that she holds a B.A.
(with honors) in political sci*
ence and mathematics from
the University of California
at Los Angeles, and has 3
Ph. D. in progress at the Unir
versity of California at Ire
vine. Her graduate career
has also included work at the
University of Wisconsin and
the University of Californiaat
Berkeley, and the holding of
NDEA and NSF fellowships.
