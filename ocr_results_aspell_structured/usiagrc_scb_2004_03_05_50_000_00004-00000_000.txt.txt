Discovering
Technology

by Colin Sollitt

Three weeks ago, ITS launched the Technology Dis-
eovery center (TDC) by hosting an evenr for faculty. As
part oflTS's long range goal of incorporating technology
in the dassroom, the thrcermom laboratory primarrly serves
as a tool to enhance the learning experience.

Located in the house on the southwest comet of Park
1nd Eighth, the TDC will also be a “test bed" for lTS's
reehnology iniriorives. “The long range goal is re have a
larger facility like this. This is kind ore prototype ofrhat
facility. It’s rust an experiment." said Karen MeRirchie, the
cenrer’s organizer.

This space was intended to be much different from
other computer labs on campus. Complete with mobile
chairs, mobile desks double monitors, an interactive white
board and muiriple irrrerner eonneeriorr points, rhe lab is
designed so riior “people can work rogerher"

Brown also thinks that Gordon-Reed’s
convocation marks a new direction in the
college's orrrrudc roward speakers. Brown
and other profcswrs. such as anthropoiogy

Grinnell should emphasize corivoearrons
and “build our speakers program into the

Prospie Hosting ’1 01

The Ofﬁce ofAdmission requires new trainings for current students who wish to host
prospective students this semester, hoping to enhance the prospie experience

by Brandi Green

For a prospective student. the visit to campus can he the deciding
factor on whether or not he or she warm to attend a particular college.
Prospective studears are not able to ﬁtlly gather rhe eharacierisrics or the
Gtinnell culrure from yusr raiding the description in the college guides or
oollege brochures. For instance, the term “st:l.kernet" is just a strange word
instead ofan action until they can place it in the righr context wiLhin the
mmpus. There are also aspects of the Gtinnell culture that a prospective
srudenr should orperienee before aocepring adnriuanee ro rhe college. in
order ro ensure rhar prospective srudenrs are gaining the most from their
visits and not just “babysitting" prospies, the omoe ofAdrnission offered
mandatory training sessions for all future hosts.

Because earnpus visirs are so important to pro.
speerive students as rhey consider Gtinnell, Dean of
Admission and Financial AidJim Sumner wants to
ensure rhese prospective studenrs see an accurate rep.
resenrarion or rhe college when rhcy visrr campus.
Keeping this in mind, Sumner has several goals for
the training program. ‘

“The brggesrsingle factor inﬂuencing a student’s
choice ofcollcge of Grinnell is their visit and so we
want their v' it to be both as :tccumtl: and inclusive
as possible. we want to give [eurrerrri srudenrs in-
formation 50 they can aeeurerely represent the college. we know rhai rhe
visit is critical to their decision,” said Sumner.

The Ofﬁce of Admission made these training sessions available to stu-
denn who want to host prospective students in order to inform rhem or
the responsibilrries and concerns drar are involved wirir hosting. This is
also an effort to eliminate bad patterns some hosts have exhibited with
prospective students in the pasr. In fact, applications are not rho only in-
crease the otrree of Admission has experienced lately. “The number or
complaints from prospective students about theirhosr has increased," said
Sumner.

The session is also a measure ro porperuare homer and increased inter.
aerron between a prospective sruderrr and the host. He recalled a situation
where a srudenr wrote an essay about his terrible visrr to the campus.
which involved his host picking him up from rhe omee ofAdnrrssions,
telling him rhai he irad plans and rhea leaving him on his own.

“You don't have ro baby-sit your prospre the enrire time while he or

“The biggest single factor
inﬂuencing a student's
choice is their visit.”

Admission and Financial Aid

she is here," he said, “but picking rhern up and dropping them off and
saying, ‘I’ll see you tomormw’ is a little extreme."

Brier training sessions were held multiple rimes during the past
couple weeks. The sessions included aeriviries like role playing, discus.
sion of logisricai and legal issues abour hosting. the srudenrs' own
prospie srories and e game orreopardy. “we usually had as few as nine
ro as many 30 srudenrs arrend rhese sessions," said Nikki barren, ad.
mission counselor. “All rhe sessions have been run and people are very
willing to participate,"

Srudenrs also received a hosring handbook rhar includes logistical in.
formation and rrequenrly asked quesrions and possible scenarios that could
occur while hosting a prospie. ln rhese “what if"
scenarios existed the elessic problem orwhar re do
with a prospie when a hosr has an exam ro prepare
tor. The appropriare example the handbook gives
in this scenario is: “l don'r blame you for nor none
rrrg to study for my organic rest with me, let me
walk you to Bob's so you nrn play bingo while l'm
studying. I’ll come get you at 9:45.”

Tire handbook also rneiudes a trickscerrarioThe
scenario is the sruderrr is at the pub having run our
the prospie looks miserable. Tire trick is rhar rhe
srudenr would never rake a 17-year-old or tsyeae
old to an esrabiislrmenr rhar requlres one be 21 ro enter.

Srudenrs nirghr fccl these trainingsesslons were helpful or necessary in
dealing wirh the rssires rhur arise when hosrrrrg a prospio. Orhcrs mighr
reel these sessions are a complete wasre or time.

“I think rhere's some good information burl rhrnk irs mostly in re.
spoase to the her rhar rhe problems widr prospies and alcohol. l don'r
really thinkltwru necessary bur Lhcn agarn l have adopied people's prospies
mony time and 1 even spenr a month traveling and being a prospie at
different colleges so I know both sides,” said lara GaasiandTatro ‘05.

The oinoe orAdnriscion will evaluare ihe rrainings based on feedback
rhey receive abour prospective srudenrs' experiences. iranyrhing they will
help ease the rensions berween prospies and lrosrs rhar could occur. This is
a new program so we just have re see rreomplainrs from prospies decrease
in time.

“we do see rhis us an experimenr.” Sumner said. “Let’s try it and see
whar happens."
