instituted by his administration.

budget problems. in his first
year, 15 faculty members were
released, and no faculty salary
raises have been permitted durt

For those of you who found
Stokley Carmichael's indicts
ment of the capitalist system
intriguing, the Symposium on
Radical Economics would have
proved enlightening and int
teresting. As members of the

interpretation of economics,
and members of URPE (Union
of Radical Political Econt
omits), Torn Weisskopf and
Rich Edwards explained and
applied various aspects of the
radical theory.

Welsskopf and Edwards be-
came involved with the radi»
cal theory through a course
at i-larvard designed to be a
radical alternative to the H31”
vard Department of Econ-
omics' standard course offer-
ings. Although, as Weisskopf
pointed out, diere IS no cone
sensus as to [he specificas-
pects of Radical Economics,
they both presented a cogent
personal view of the theory,

Radical Economics is viewed
as different from the orthtr
dox View in its inclusion of
political, sociological and i-
deological variables in an ex;
planation of not only how the
system functions but why. The
radical view takes a great
deal from early Marxistwrlt-
ings, cspeciallyThe Commun-
ist Manifesto, but takes little
from its later economic mg,

mg his tenure.

However, he reduced thl‘alinual
budget deficit from $50U,lJlJU to
$393,000: and he is CTCdLICd by
the Monmouth Ora clonenspaper
with saving Monmouth College
from “the possibility of closing
its doors."

Grinnell Presidnt Gicnn Legs
gett said he had no direct krr
olvledge of the decision to re-
sign, but said he believed StinL‘
felt his budget cutting efforts
had made his other efforts at
the college very difficult.

Leggett described Stine as a
“very kind, warm“ individual.

The radical theory focuses
its criticism on the prevails
ing norms of the productive
system of our society. The
interests of capitalism — effi-
cient resource allocation, eat
onomic growth, andprofitma»
ximization would be replaced
by a comprehensive study of
the inequality of wealth and
income, the condition oflabor,
the exercise of power by the
economically advantaged, and
long range social changes.

Just as Radital Economic's
origin was political, stemm-
ing from the radical politi'

so is its application in so

Weisskopt's viewpoint is to
use its framework to funda'
mentally change the system
through political organiza~
tions and education. Speciii'

native socialization system
with decentralized means of
production, abolition of hier-
archical systems of decision»
making in firms andcconomic
organizations, and changed
work incentives to include

Popcorn

At least two Grinncll students
were affected by popcorn balls
containing a drug believed to be
LSD.

One student exhibited all sympt
toms of “tripping" and a second
exhibited milder symptoms after
receiving the candy Halloween

pus house.

College officials, who declined
to name the students, noted that
use of any drug, especially an

Nixon’s Chances "

by Deirdre Smith

Professors Joe Wally Ira 5“"
auber, and Wayne Mayer, and
students Leonard Kurz and Fred
Horecky, participated In a dis-
cussion which was carried live
on KDic Wednesday night con-
cerning the present presidential
situation, the implications Ofim‘
pcachment, and impeachment as
opposed to resignation.

Leonard Kurtz, the moderator,
began by explaining mat the con-
stitution provides for the Press
ident's removal from Office on
impeachment for, and conviction
of, high crimes and misdemean-
ors. Nixon's alleged upsurption
of Congress' warsmaking power,
his assault on civil liberties, his
illegal impoundment offunds,and
his obstruction of Justicewere ci-
ted as grounds forimpeachment.

Professor Wall dealt basically
with impeachment as a process
rather than specifically with Nip
xon’s impeachment. He pointed
out that impeachment is simply
an investigative step comparable
to indictment and is not a COtr
viction or an ouster. He dispel-
led the misconception that the
founding fathers viewedimpaach'
ment as an exceptionally rare
procedure. '

Then the words "high crimes
and misdemeanors" were analy-
zed as to their meaning in the
18th century. According to Wall,
they implied “not necessarily
criminal action but political ac
tion, action against the state...
either of omission or commiSS'
ion."

ira Strauber concentrated his
remarks on the preference for
impeachment over resignation
and on the necessity of dealing

with the fundamental Problem of
abuse of Presidential power.

Though he views probability of
Congress impeaching the Presi-
dent as very low, he feels that
such an action would be crucial
in correcting our present lacit
Of a “viable dieck on Presiden-
tial power."

"The impeachment itself we 6
give the Congress sufficientseo
Se of Self-esteem to fare out
at least some of the important
issues."

Professor Moyer disagreed
With Strauber and contended that
impeachment might produce
“more heat than light."

He also mentioned foreign pol-
icy considerations. The Presis
dent’s decreased ability to neg-
otiate and a possible reacti
ary, Anti-Communist movcmt
against Nixon's policies “coul
have an adverse effect on nego~
tlations with the oviet Unionand
the SALT talk

Furthermore, ‘a lengthy Im’
peachment process is an incen-
tive to exaggerate a crisis sit-
uation, to rally the people has
hind him. "

The Professors were in agree-
ment that no more amendments
were needed to correct the pre-
sent crisis, but simply a Chang.
in Congress’ attitude. Wall said
that “the 22nd amendment may
be as much at {aulthcrc as 31*
most anything.” Theamendment,
which restricts the President
to two terms. was decryed by
all three professors.

The congress' recent override
of a Presidential veto was seen
as an encouraging sign that per-
haps the Legislative branch is
beginning to exert its power and
fulfill its responsibilities.
