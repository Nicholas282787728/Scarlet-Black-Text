Final Rebuttal—b? Institute Cap.
tain Was Deciding Factor
in Clash

loluan literary society was defeated
for the hrst time in lour years in the
annual no i political debate last
night, when institute, led by ildurlec
Fruilurul, tool: the long end of a :i to
2 decision in one of the closest rvord
arguments ever heard in Grinncll.

Noel cf lonian presented the best
constructive speech, while Frrdlund
easily won the palm ln rebuttal. Inc
stitute argued the alto-mativc of thc
question, "Resolved, That the govern
men - present policy of firing prices
is desirable." The ii mg or the prices
of coal and wheat \ a

two lCitlns clashed on various phases
of these questions.
Almost a Draw

The debate was pr ctlcztlly a draw
when Harold Van Dol'n closed the a!
gmnent for the negative, but Frid-
illutl‘s unusually strong rebuttal was
undoubtedly the deciding factor ill the
decision of the judges. Hal-01d Van
Dorn and Floyd Van Dorn, for Ion-
ian, presented sound arguments, and
Smith and Ai'nlhiuster, for Institute.

submitted their side of the question
' in a ‘

ccnv a manner.
institute contended that a policy of
federal price ﬁxing should be adopted
because of its practicahi ty, its pm-
_tection to both the producer and the
consumer, and because of its certain-
ty to increase the production oi food.
staffs and fuel. .
Policy Would Be Deminlentiil
Ionian contended that the adoption
oi such a policy would be detrimental
because it takes into consideration
' only alew factors ot production, omit-
ting lahor'and machinery; because it
involves an element of tuturity, and
no government can predict the de-
mand for a certain product, and de-
‘tcrmine its price, a year in advance-
because it has been disastrous in ex
pel‘iencehzmd because better methods
can be devised, including a campaign
of popular education to teach the peo-
plc the country's needs. and the reds
dering of ﬁnancial assistance to the
producer.
in rebuttal, Ionian attempted It)
show that price ﬁxing has brought the
country almost to the verge cl a coal
famine, but Institute replied that this
was caused by a shortage of cars
rather than in any defect in the price
ﬁxing scale. Fl'idlund proved that
altho the output of many goods has
been curtailed since the enactment of
the law, the producers have willfully
restricted the output of those goods
in order to allow the jobber-s their
customary exorbitant proﬁts.
Judges From University
The judges last night included N,
R. Whitney and C. hi. Case of the Uni-
versity of Iowa, Professor .7. D. Stoops,
Dr. L. G. Lemley and Robert Kerr of
Grinnell. President Main presided.
The annual Merrill prize of $120 for

cusslou or problems in current polir
ties. The debate next year will be

Dramatic Club Is Finishing Work
for Thursday

“Rehearsals are progressing very
well in sprte of difficulties and stu-
dents ovcrhurdencd with work,” said
Protcssol' J. P. Ryan. in speaking of
the production of “Maggie Pepper" by

GﬂNTRASTS TYPES llF MEN

President Main Speaks of College
/ and Army Men

President Main contrasted the dis-
ciplined man of the tl'iuuing camp
who “looks like a prince” to the Col-
lege student whose “slouch habit" is

permitted by democracy, in a chapel
address yesterday morning.

“It is a disgrace to a college or uni.
vcrsity tor a father to say he would
rather have his son in the training
camp, Uncle Sam's university, than in
any collegeor university in the land,"
the speaker declared.

’1‘0 actually compel a man to do a
thing he should do is not in harmony
with democracy, in the opinion of
President Main.

He expressed dissatisfaction at a
row of the incidents which have one
curred at the men‘s dormitories re~
ccntly, particularly in the naming of
the buildings and the pranks which
have been forced upon the freshmen.
“I=n't there enough of the spirit of
order and discipline, of respect for
and: sell and others, to create a trim»
dition or excellence and distinction
for this college?” he concluded.
