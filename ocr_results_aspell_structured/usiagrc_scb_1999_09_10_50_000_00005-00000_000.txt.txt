Walking inro the Forum

paintings depicring downrown
Grinnell grecr you, The 15 oil
painrings vary in conrenr, from
consrrucrion sires ro rhe Depor
Crossing resrauranr ro a downrown
gas srarion. The arrisr, Dan
Donaldson ‘00, describes his work
as “American realism.”

His inspiration? “I prerry much
grew up on a consrrucrion sire," he
said, “so 1 was inrercsrcd in painring
rhose scenes. When 1 ran our of
consrrucrion sires, 1 moved on ro
rhcorhcrbuildings.”

The oil painrings are a new
experimenr for arr major
Donaldson, as he regularly painrs
wirh acrylics. He complered all 15
paiurings [his summer, and now
hopes ro hnd rime ro porrray orher
of rhe surrounding
community, namely srorcfronrs and
differenr rypes ofagriculrure.

“Midwesrern landscapes seem to
be a common theme in painrings,
bur his unlquc sryle make rhe
painrings original and exciring,"
said arr hisrory major Charlie
Marshall ’00.

julian zebor ‘00 cxprcssed
similar senrimenrs, “ I rhoughr rhar
he did a good job of capruring
Grinnell,” he said “Whilc‘his
paintings were disrincrively Iowani
rhey also had an original flair 1
was very impressedi 1 had never
seen his arrwork before, and I really

areas

enjoyed it."

Donaldson john
Regisrer, a painrer from California,
as an influence on his work.
“Register has a similar way of
viewing rhe world rhar 1 do.“ he
said, Donaldson also enjoys rhe
works of Edward Hopper, as well
as rhe duo komar and Melamud.
ocher inﬂuences include crinnell
art professor Bobby Mckibbin and
coe College professor Peter

named

Thompson. “i’ve definirely
improved a 1or in rhe lasr year wirh
rhe direerion and guidance rhey
have given me," said Donaldson.

Marshall said, “Dan’s sryle has
really developed in rhe pasr rwo
years, since we rock Intro ro Art
together. lwouldn’r hesirare ro say
rhar Dan is one ofrhe besr, if not
rhc besr painrcr ar Grinnell,"

Donaldson has nor always been
so focused on his arr. He was an
economics major until his junior
year. “When 1 gor a D in macro, I
realized 1 hared econ, and 1 had
always loved air. 1 had only raken
rhree arr classes up ro rhar poinr,
bur I switched my major anyway.
For me, painring is a productive
way ofblowing offsream."

Afrer leaving Grinncll,
Donaldson hopes ro arrend
graduare school, possibly ar rhe
Universiry of Iowa or Bosron
Museum of Fine Arrs.“Tl-1cy have
solid painring programs, and srill
(cach traditional American
realism," said Donaldson. Afrcr
grad school, Donaldson has plans
of reaching, “but only as a means
ofgerring a srudio and asready
painring job,” he said.

Donaldson said rhar he is
sarisfied wirh his colleerion of
painrings rhis summer, “1 figured
rhar wirh rhe number ofpainrings,
lwas bound ro have a good one in
rhere somewhere.”

Apparenrly, orher people have
rhoughr so roo, four of rhe
painrings rhar are on display have
already been purchased.
Addirional painrings srill hang in
rhe Forum basemenr.

Donaldson encourages rhc
communiry to view his painrings
and ralk wirh him abour his work,
And for any undeclared or unhappy
majors, Donaldson has one piece
of advice, “Remember, arr is one
ofrhe few subjecrs in school where
you can do your homework when
you're drunk."

Well, the Films Committee is
off to a fabulous start , it's only
the second weekend and they are
already showing two gems that
we've never heard of. Bless their
little hearts. Theyju‘st like to make
our job difficult. Bullocks to
them!! We‘re gonna stick itto ‘em
by looking at two movies from the
ranks ofthe summer blockbusters.
Maybe these movies will
eventually come to Grinnell and
our review will be relevant,

I guess we should at least
mention what is playing this
weekend. .

Limbo (Friday @ 7:30 p.m.,
Saturday @ 2 p.m.)—The poster
looks crappy and that’s all we need
to know. Never heard ofitiwon't
go see it.

Little Voice (Saturday @ 7:30
p.m., Sunday @ 3 pm.) Saw the
poster in Videoland e no desire to
rent.

The first eagerly-awaited
movte of the summer was Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shaggcd
Me, starring Mike Myers (in
multiple roles), Heather Graham,
Rob Lowe, and some really Short
guy.

C: I saw the sneak preview in
Grinnell (I’m still wondering how
Grinnell actually scored the sneak
preview) and as 1 watched, it was
just total déja vu. I was like,
“Helloiwe’vc heard all these
jokes before. Doesn‘t anyone else
realize this?” I thought I had
accidentally walked into the
original.

A: While I wasn’t lucky enough
to score Sneak preview tix, idid
see this one twice , on opening

day. Call me a loser, but I had
some friends who wanted to see it
after I saw it earlier in the day.

c: Okay e loser.

A: I never like to let a friend
down. Anyway, the ﬁrst half of
this movie was hysterical. The
Second halfwas a rehashing ofthe
jokes from the Original. I’d be the
first to admit that sequels are
inferior, but this one actually had
some redeeming value, The new
characters were original, and Dr.
Evil is one of the best,villains in
recent cinematic history,

C: I thought all the new
characters sucked, The only
person [liked in this whole movie
was Seth Green who played Scott
Evil. And, I only liked him
because he‘s in that movie Can’t
Hardly Wait (which I highly
recommend, by the way),

A: Courtney obviously doesn’t
understand the role a sequel plays.
It’s all about the merchandisz. And
who hasn’t seen the cutout of
Mini—Me/hanging out of that
window on Norris 2nd?

C: I haven’t. Anyway, I’m sick
oftalking about this one.

Courtney‘s Beer Scale;

Number of Miller High Lifes
needed to enjoy the movie: just
buy a Sepack and rent the original.

‘How Many Times Aaron Paid
To See This Movie;

An obvious reﬂection of
quality: any attentive reader would
already know. Look it up,

The Sixth Sense starring Bruce
Willis, that kid from Forrest
Gump, and a very creepy looking
Donny Wahlberg of NKOTE
fame.

C: I think that this was one of
the best movies that I have seen
in a really long time. I was so
creeped out that I had to sleep with
the lights on that night. I watched
half of the movie through my
fingers, The premise is Bruce
