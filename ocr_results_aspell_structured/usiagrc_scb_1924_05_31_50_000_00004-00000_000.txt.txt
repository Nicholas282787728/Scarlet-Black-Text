Contest Plans Changed ‘— Grinnell
Club Is Last to Go East
From Prairie States.

“Grinnell is the last school in the
middle wesii which will have the hon-
or of sending a Glee club to compete
with those oi the East, in the East,"
was the announcement
“Dave” Peck, director of the Grinneil
Men’s Glee club, at a breakfast served
the club by Mesdames David E. Peck
and George L. Pierce, at the iFeek
home yesterday morning.

"The eastern schools have ruled
against a western school coming to
them, and if we ever again‘ compete
with Harvard and Yale it will he in
in some centrally located city, to
which the cluhs of the universities of
both coasts can come."

Mr. Peck expressed the possibility

of a. nation-wide Glee club contest, to .

be held in the middle west, which
‘would he attended by the winning
clubs trom both coasts, as well as
from the prairie states. According to
him, the formation of such an Organ-

“ ization is simply a matter or time and
money. However. this ‘chaoge in
plans gives the local club the unique
distinction of being the last middle»
western club to compete against east—
em Schools, in the east.

Glee club pins wereawarded to the
new members or the club, otter the
three course breakfast served by the
hostesses. As the club was enlarged

'i from twenty-four memhers this year,

a large number of the vocalists have
now completed only their first year
with the club. Pins were given by
the president, Earl Burch, to Lloyd
Good, James Cal-l, Barton Schoenernan,
