HE recent unturtunate alIair at
Kenyon College, Ohio, in which
a young man was killed during his ini-
tiation into a fraternity, has 'lg‘aiu
brought torch a storm of or srn
against secret societies, and Grinnell
students are to be congratulated on
the tact that fraternities and sorori-
ties have not gained a ioothold in this
institution. In this particular case,
the candidate for admission was placed
on a railroad track in front or an ap-
proaching train. His friends intend-
ed to remove him before the train
reached the spot but misjudged the
speed of the train and as aresult their
victim was struck and killed. IIis
ﬁrlcnds ﬂed and now the authorities
have or sterl a number of prominent
fraternity men and there is the possir
bliity that. the men will be held for
manslaughter by the courts.

This case is only one in thousands,
but it illustrates the fundamental
weakness which is evident in every
ﬁnstltution where there are atsr”
cor course the same thing might hale
.occurrcd in a class scrap and the ric-
tim might have been a bigoted sopho-
more or agreen Ircshinan, but the fact
to notice is that such cases are oorur
mon amour: fraternities, willie class
iscrdps seldom go to that extreme,
Regﬂldless or the practices and cris-
toms, which fraternities bring to an
institution. or oi the fatalities which
.resuhi, they are a thorn in the ilesh at
'a'il times.

They are undemocratic and tend to
create factions and cliques among the
student holly Ill an institution of
this re, such omimiz tions are di-
.reclly opposed to the best interests or
undergraduate life from llle vci-y nir-
turc or things. You must have unity
and every student project must be sup-
ported liy the united student body
Where irats crlst, this is hope, ihle,
because the frat roan puts his ociety

thought is [or his iraternity: his last

{rats are an expensive luxury and only
the students with money can belong.
On account oi this very fact, we have

most dangerous pcrrcrsiou that could
happen to student hie. What has
made the American educational sys-
tem srrperiorto allotlicrs in the world,
is that in our public schools and col-
leges, the rich and poor mecton a com-
mon footing. Their interests are the
same and a bond of sympathy and oi
mutual conirdcnce in each other grows
up. In any other system \llis condi-
tion would he impossible.

Flats are unnecessary in the small
college and it is rloubtiul whether they
can be yustilied in the large institu—
tion, There is no reason in a small
college, wily astudent should become
a iron man. Tllcre are seieral diner»
out things to which he can turn
his attention. The literary societies
oircr'inany of the advantages of a irat
without the accompanying evils. As-
sociation with his iellow students
should be regarded as a privilege not
asatortui-e, It isa man's right to
choose his own iriends, but it is en-
tirely possible to do this without coin-
pelling them to undergo the barbarous
practices which are characteristic or
an uncivilized people. It a student
wishes crclusiveness he should never
enter- the democratic school oi the
Gilnuell type. Flats are undemocrat-
ic, uuAmericdn, and are antagonistic
to all phases oi student life and activ-
ities which are so dear to the heart or
every true Grinncllian. May the day
never come when the students of this
institution ﬁnd themselves so far out
of harmony with the Grinnell spirit
and Grinneli traditions as even to suit
gest the possibility of a secret society.

Jack London, the noted author
who lectures here next Friday erening
on the Y. M. C. A. course, was married
DD Miss Charmirtu Kitrbl'edge in Chico-
go “'eliuesdary. He is ﬁnding out how-
ever that the course of true love does
not run any smoother for noted writers
than for Ordinary mortals. The laws
of Illinois provide that a year must
elapse beforeildivorced main cztll re-
marry and as it is less than a year
since Mr. London was divorced from
his ﬁrst wile it is going to be neces-
sary for the couple to remariy iir order
to make their union legal. Next Fri-
day night a party of Newton people
willcome here to hear Mr. London's
lecLui‘e and the next day, accompanied
by air. and Mrs. London, the party
will go to Newton, the guests of Mr.
and Mrs. w. E McMurray.
