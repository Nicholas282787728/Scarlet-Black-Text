tee: in the center of controversy

Hulnick feels a precedent has not
been made and that both candidates
were equally qualified, despite
Mandel‘s years on the 8&8. She adds
ed, “1 think working on the 3&3 and
knowing that you have contributed to
a final product should be a reward in
itself."

Rawland feels as well that no precer
dent has been set. She realizes that
she will need to work closely with
Lenk to get some of the editorial ex-
perience she lacks, but feels a “bigger
precedent would be set. if SP&R
rescinded their decision . l , You can‘t

should turn into all news or all one
other thing.” She cited several areas
that she felt were potential news
stories: the issue of funding club
sports, changes in food service, the
steprup in dorm renovations, off-
campus programs, and the pet policy.
“Some of these are small stories but
still need looking into,” stated
Rawland. She also would like to end
some inconsistencies she has seen this
semester, citing SGA stories in par-
ticular, where she says some things
have been “blatantly false."
According to Yoe, “The SPSzR is a

committee has failed to justify its decision

make a hard and fast rule" that
number of years on the 5&8 “be the
only qualification for the editor,”

On the mird point, Flynn and
Schultz asked SP&R to clarify their
statement on campus and 5&8
philosophy. They want to know “what
the 5&8 should be" and ”what is the
philosophy of the campus community
and how were they able to determine
it.” Their contention is that the only
major philosophical difference be
tween Mandel and Rawland is that
Anne believes staff meetings are
necessary and John does not.

However, during the interviews dif-
ferent philosophies seem to have been
stressed by the candidates. Schultz,
who was present at the i ltial inter
views, believes SPELR misinter-
preted Mandel, who Schultz says
”wants a balanced newsmagazine.”
He feels this misinterpretation alone is
reason enough for a review. Mandel
Stated, “They (SPGIR) were down on
me because they thought I was enter-
tainment oriented, which isn’t true.
There was a lack of depth and
analysis on some focus stories, and I‘d
like to broaden the news, but I don't
want to make it dull because there's
not that much going on from week to
week."

Hulnick said that in her interview
Rawland repeatedly emphasized the
need for more news. “I’m not about to
turn the 3&3 hack into a newspaper,”
said Rawland during a separate inter-
view. “I know news on campus is
sometimes hard to find, but I think it’s
there. , . and I don’t think the $513

committee of five or six individuals
who, irom their own experiences in
living in the campus community, talk-
ing to people, and reading and listen»
ing to the campus media, have formed
their own perceptions oi the campus
philosophy and who try to act on those
perceptions." Yoe added, ”Personally,
it seemed to me that the major source
of dissatisfaction with this year’s 5&8
was the amount of news stories. And
from What was said in the interviews
it seemed that Anne would do more in
that light." When asked whether or
not she felt John had been misinterr
preted, Yoe replied, “i can’t comment
particularly on that . . . not having
heard from John Mandel himself.”

Hulnick expressed much the same
View as Yoe. She said that Anne‘s
“general time placed more of an em-
phasis on news" than Johns and that
“the committee felt the different
stress put on it (by Anne) would be
better for the 55:13,” As far as the
philosophy of the campus is concern-
ed, Hulnick replied, “The campus
doan't have one overriding ideology.
Anne has certain ideas about what the
5&3 should be. everybody does. Here
it’s more personal . . . I can say a ma-
jority oi people would like to see more
news reporting . . . a lot of people
have spoken to me about it."

Mandel doesn't think Rawland‘s or
SP&R’s concept of the campus
philosophy adequately reﬂects the
true desires of the college community.
“I think the campus attitude is change
ingil don't think more sports is un-
warranted, but I'd also like to see

more in-depth news stories. We really
haven't had the writers to do them
this year." Mandel also complained
that the interviewing process was
sloppy and unprofessional. “Some peo

ple hadn‘t even read my resume," he. .

said. “They seem to think 1 had an
emphasis on entertainment. That’s
simply not true. m the campus

editor, and oi course I have a strong . :

news preference."
Schultz feels that since no member

or the sth committee has had any I f

direct contact with staff operations,

his recommendation of Mandel should ,

have been a deciding factor. He is
upset that the committee seems to
have ignored the recommendation of
the only people who have had direct
contact with both candidates throug
the 5&8.

Yoe replied to this by saying. “In

mat case, maybe there shouldn‘t be an;
SPhR committee. We assume we are . .p
the overseers of the campus _ .

media—not active participants in its
daily activities.” Hulnick echoed this

sentiment and added that ”SP&R'S job.’

is to oversee, to look at something, in
this case the editorship, and put in the
person we ieel will do the best job . . .
I don’t feel the committee, on the
whole, has been given a fair shake."
She noted that Schultz's advice,
although ultimately recommending '
John, “made Anne seem almost equal-
ly qualified."

“The vote not to review the decision'
was unanimous,” said Hulnick. “If
they had convinced us that we made a
wrong decision, then we would have
reviewed . . . nothing told to us at the

meeting was anything that we didn t , .

already know or told us that we acted
unfairly," she added

Mandel believes that SP&R has
“tailed to justify their decision to us

(the 88:8 staff) and the campus come i i

munity . . . when they fail to do this it ’

means they can pick anyone out of the ’

air. This decision has set a dangerous
precedent

Rawland feels there is “room for
clarification" in the decision making
process by “making criteria [or selec-
tion more concrete." Rawland com- ‘
mented. “I hope i can smooth over
some of the hostilities that have been

created against me. l'm not trying to ' ‘

move in and take over. I’m not

against anyone, once people see that, - ~

they will redirect their hostilities
toward 5PM: . . I applied for the
position and received it. I plan to
fulfill the position to the best of my
ability . . .
work for me.”
