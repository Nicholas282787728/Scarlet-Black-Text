Field Hockey

Out with the old; in with the new

by Terri Pui'ter

Don’t let the skirts fool you.
Field hockey isn’t as dainty a
sport as the garb might suggest
The continued wearing of the
skirts is merely in keeping with
tradition 7 and it’s about the only
tradition the Women's Field
Hockey team adheres to these
days,

Last year's winning record
marked only the beginning of a
major turnaround ior the women.
The team's 50 NCAA Conference
record and bi overall record thus
far this season not only continue
the breaking of an old tradition.
but also are laying the foundation
for a brand new tradition . . . winn-
ing! The two most recent wins
came last weekend against
Luther, 3-1. and lowa Wesleyan,
3-1.

And who would‘ve thought , . .
With the loss of five starters from
last year’s squad, the youth oi this
year‘s team, and the presence of
an new coach, who would have
thought that this iield hockey
team could repeat their previous
successes?

But they have, They‘ve done
that and more. So what's the
secret? “Motivation" says Coach
Dee Fairchild. which. according
to her, entails a lot of confidence»
building 7 making the players
“feel good about themselves and
their abilities.”

Fairchild's motivation
capabilities are enhanced by a
group of what she terms “very
coachable athletes." In initiating

Soccer

With a 9-0 blowout over Wart-
burg last Friday, the Men’s Soc-
cer team ”got back on track,” ac-
cording to Coach John Pfitsch.

“We were pleased to be able to
score because a weak offense has
always been a real problem in the
past,” he stated.

The team indeed seemed back
on track when they beat the
University of Chicago on Satur-
day, 470. Pfitsch noted that the two
teams have been fairly even in the
past, so the win was a real boost
ior the Grinnell squad.

“It was as good a game as I’ve
ever seen a Grinnell team play for
me 7 all-around." observed
Piitsch, “I think we're now feeling
confident thal'we can score."

And the team did just that
against Cornell on Wednesday
night by posting a 74) victory. “We
have a lot of potential,” Pfitsch
declared, “so things can get bet
ter and better,"

Women’s
Cross Country

Pulling out a iiithplace iinish in
an steam field at last weekend’s
Les Duke invitational held here.
the Women’s Cross Country team
“placed close to what i expected,"
remarked Coach Evelyn

3-0

a new, more aggresswe offense at
the start of the season. Fall’clilld
was unsure about how effective it
would be 7 mainly because it re
quires a lot of switching among
positions. which the women
weren't used to,

But the scores and Fairchild
herself both indicate that the team
has notonly made the adjustment.
. , they’ve made it work. As Fair-
child observed. “The nice thing
about it [the offense] is that
everyone in the iront line is scorr
ing," The key word here is
“everyone" 7 a team effort has
brought about their success.

“The whole team plays hard
and aggressive and is a definite
part oi every win we’ve had."
noted Fairchild. Continuing, she
said, ”There isn't any one person
who stands out — everyone Stands
out."

With such a cohesive team unit.
Fairchild believes there are no
weaknesses on the field. “We have
the confidence, and we play as a
team” she asserted. adding, “If
one or two people are having a bad
day, the others are out there right
behind them to back up.”

This is true not only in the
figurative sense of emotional sup-
port. but also in the literal sense of
actually helping out in a position
they don’t normally play. The new
offense, with all the switching in-
volved. has, according to Fair-
child. increased the team’s vex»
satility in that “we have a lot of
people who can play different

Freeman. noting the high quality
oi the competition

“We had a mixed bag as far as
individual performances," she
stated. “Some Showed steady im»
provement and ran well while
some could have done better."

She was pleased that individual
results were higher than past
Grinnell scores recorded for this
invitational. Shavaun Adams
finished fourth with a time of
19:47, while Ellen Mungan placed
15th with a 20:40,

The times were recorded at 5000
meters. which is the first time this
year the women have run that
distance, “They're all_worki.ng
very hard," observed Freeman.
“50 I can't expect to see fantastic
results as iar as times go.”

Tomorrow in the Simpson Inn
vitational, though, she expects
good things. saying. “We won last
year there and now we're going
ior it again.”

Tennis

The Grinnell College Women‘s
Tennis Team brought its record to
3-4 with a close loss on Saturday to
Coe and a victory Monday over
Simpson.

The team lost 5-4 to Coe, with
Grinnell taking three of the six
singles matches. Lynette lckes at
iii singles defeated her opponent
6-2, 6-2. and Carolyn Carpenter

positions "

Senior Co-Captains Kathy
Cullen and Valerie Mauck agree
that the oiicnsive changes are key
to the team's success.

Mauck stated, "We have a lot
more movement this year anti are
thinking much more in terms oi
offense rather than defense ”
Cullen agreed and credited much
of the team's success to their
agressiveness,

As another factor, Cullen noted,
”The attitude has changed. We no
longer succumb to the Grinnell
‘tradition' — we don’t go into a
game expecting to lose,” Mauck
affirmed this claim and also
highlighted the team's tenacity as
significant. “We never give up."
she remarked. “no matter what
the circumstances."

This tenacity, combined with
aggressweness. and required
skills. and a coach who sees her
ability to motivate as her
strongest asset, make it no
wonder that the team is being cons
sidered in a bid for Nationals. The
lack of a strong schedule is
definitely not to their advantage
in the consideration. thus making
the next two weekends very im-l
portant.

The women play in the Luther
Invitational this weekend and at
Carlton next weekend. Carlton
has always been a strong oppOV
nent for Grinnell, and the Luther
Invitational also offers some
tougher competition against the
likes of Bemidji State and Univerr

and Jean Hornyak. at #5 and #6
singles. also registered victories.

The score was tied 373 after the
singles matches, but Coe took two
of the three doubles matches.
Grinnell was able to win only the
#3 doubles match, in which Sheryl
Williams and Jill Shimabukuro
defeated their opponents 6-3. 6-1.

“We had our chances." Coach
Judy Hunter noted. “but We lost
some very close matches. They
were tougher mentally than we
were, and they were able to pull
out the close dries.”

On Monday the team defeated
Simpson College. 9-0. in a match
at lndianoia. “Our players had
more solid fundamental strokes
than did theirs. and the outcome
oi the match was really never in
doubt,” Hunter said.

On Thursday. Sept. 27, the team
took on Division II powerhouse
University of Northern Iowa at
home. and tomorrow will travel to
play Wartburg and Upper iowa.

Men ’3
Cross Country

Running in the Les Duke lnvilar
tional this past weekend. the
Men's Cross Country team finish-
ed sixth out of )2 teams.

Coach Will Freeman was pleas-
ed with the results 7 mainly in
terms of improvement. He stated.
“This course was much tougher
than the flat five miles they ran at
Coe last week, and yet most im-
proved their times."

and LaCross.

In discussing the bid, Fairchild
commented, “if we get it. I think
we'll be able to do very. very well
if we can stay healthy."

Notwithstanding possible
physical ailments, the team
seems pretty healthy in terms of
their mental attitude. And with
the loss of only two seniors aiter
this season, things are looking
good in terms of continuing the
winning tradition at Grinnell,

Freshman Rob DeLong, who was
out due to a knee injury. "is runnr
ing again and may be back before
too long, He’s a very fine runner
and will help us out when he gets
healthy,"

Along with the women's team.
the men go to lndianola tomorrow
for the Simpson Invitational. “It's
a very hilly course 7 the toughest
one we'll see all year,” coma
mented Freeman, "so we've spent
the week doing various hill
workouts to ready ourselves,"

Volleyball

Parents' Weekend was a busy
one for Grinnell athletics, and the
Volleyball team was no exception,
Saturday saw the women playing
three matches against Monmouth,
Knox and Luther.

The loss to Monmouth put the
Lady Pioneers at 171 in conference
play. Noting the scores oi 545.
3-15. and 13-15. Coach Deb McCar-
ty said, “I didn’t feel we were in
the game emotionally until the
third game."

The match against Knox proved
a victory ior Grinnell, taking the
best two of three 7 4—15. 1579. 156.

Luther being the last match-up.
Grinnell had a hard time staying
in the game mentally and lost.
615, 0-I5.

Wednesday night‘s match
against Wartburg proved a let-
down for the team as they lost 7
9715, 15-10. 13-15, 3-15, McCarty
stated, “At this point, we really do

~ have pretty good skills — it seems

the team’s biggest problem is

As Fairchild puts it. “The nice
thing is that we have a. young
team for the future . , . if there isa
future for field hockey at
Grinnell."

if change truly is a “sign of the
times.” then the efforts of the
team 7 focusing on breaking the
old traditions and stereotypes and
establishing new ones 7 can only
mean continued success. The
traditional uniform will probably
always exist. But don't let the
skirts tool you

always sense the confidence that
should be there with players of
their caliber."

The women begin a series oi
road trips starting Monday night
against william Penn.

Football

After a weekend off from com-
petition. the Football team was
back in action last Saturday
against Belolt. Even though the
score 13873) wasn't close. Coach
John Martinek “saw some
positive things.”

He noted Freshman Mick
MacLean as a standout who “ran
and caught the ball well," Mars
tinek further observed. “There
were also a number of freshmen
and secondateam people who saw
considerable action when several
first-team members went out of
the game with an assortment of
ailments."

Martinek pointed to Beloit as
one of the strongest teams in the
conierence this year, After play-
ing them, he believes “the players
have a better undeistanding oi the
competitive level in the Midwest
Conference." and went on to say.
“We can use this to our benefit in
playing other teams in the con-
ference."

The team will have to wait
another week before iacing a cons
ference opponent, but the next
match-up with Ripon, who is also
(H in their conference, should be a
good one. The game is tomorrow
on home turf at 1:30,
