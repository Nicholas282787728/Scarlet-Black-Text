—To Be Porirayed

The motion picture which has nae

“The River", will be shown in the
Little Treater of the Quadrangle
at .30, Thursday evening, April
30, under the sponsorship of the
Science club, George Matlack,
president, said today.

Filmed at a cost of $50,000, the
picture deals with the "life his-
tory" of the Mississippi. Pare
Lorentz, who also wrote and proA

Plains", directed the entire pro—
duction for which a sixsman crew
covered 22,000 miles of Mississippi
valley during the winter of 1936-
37.

Narrative for the show was
written by Lorentz to interpret
the cadence of the river itself.
John Thomas Chalmers, Metropo—
litan Opera star, is narrator.

0f the picture, Time magazine
said . . a swift cinematic his-
tory of the vast Mississippi sys-
tem from pre-coliimbian times to
yesterday afternoon a mo»
tion picture of startling photo-
graphic beauty and sweeping
scope.”

The admission charge of 10
cents will defray costs for rental
from the University of Iowa Ex-
tension service, Matlaek said.

Once again the conscientious lea-
ders of the Grinnell bourgeoisie
met with Dr. Stevens. Congrer
gating to discuss the bearded
problem, definition of the powers
wielded by student government,

the pattern of past conferences
was adhered to.

And can it he otherwi nith
the calllpusrwire acceptance of
student government as we lrnow
it today?

We claim no exceptional power
of insight, no intellect that gives
us complete solvation of our prob
lem; however, we offer, as a sug-
gestion, what we are pleased to
call the “Cash and carry" stu-
dent rcpresentation plan.

Likening oin- political organiza
tion to that of a city plan where-
in the elected execute definite,
defined duties with both moral
and monetary recompense, the
thought is offered that Grinnell,
as a political unity, should adopt
a similar, arpnized method of
pmt‘errdeﬁnition, execution of law
and order, and complete compen-
sation of leaders.

Not a sudden, fly'rby-nigllt plan
for upheaval of government, we
ask sincere application of this
thought by Grinnell's student
body, that the tools of our lea-
ders may be sharpened upon the
grindstone of completeness.

Sincerely yours,

Square Dancing
Will Be Taughl
In Gym Friday

“Pioneer Promenaders," an organs
ization from Denver university for
students interested in old-time
dances, Will demonstrate and teach
a Grinncll audience the technique
of square dancing next Friday at
8 p. m., in the gymnasium.

The dancers acquired their name
from the university which is
know as the Pioneer school of
high learning in the Rocky Moun-
tain region.

A member of the Denver inter-
national Folk Festival association
since 1934, and directed by Miss
Mabel Killing, the group always
portrays either the early pioneer
life of the West or signifies the
"melting pol" of all nationality
groups.

The girls wear dresses of pio-
ricer stylc, and boys are attired in
bright colored shirts and necirer—
chiefs, cowboy trousers and boots.
Their favorite type of program,
that which they Will present at
Grinnell, is to demonstrate the
dances first and then have the
audience Join them.

Lowell Thomas has said of
them, "They are superb."

"I was so enthusiastic that l
invited them all to come with me
to the Rainbow Room and Stork
Club for a party and impromtu
performance," said Arthur Mur-
ray, famous New York dancing
instructor.
