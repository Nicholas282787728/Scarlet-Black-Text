Trees take brunt of storm

by 'r, Elaine Carey

The Dutch Elm disease was
worse, but last Thursday’s ice
storm ,did its fair share of damage
to the campus trees. Three large
trees and about a dozen small ones
were uprooted, said Dale Hawn,
physical piant director. Dozens
were damaged.

The campus “tree surgeon," Ben
Graham, will be called to do some
doctoring soon, Hawn said. Clean
up was to finish last Tuesday.

_ Graham then will be asked to

advise the physical plant stari on
how to treat the injured trees.
Trees with rough breaks will be
trimmed smooth and a sealant will
be applied to protect the wood and
allow the tree to continue growing,
Hawn explained.

Maple, pine, evergreen. and
hemlock trees were hit hardest,
Hawn noted, adding that hardwood
trees are more hearty,

Most of the branches cleaned up
have been dumped at the city
dump, although a small portion has
been kept to dry out for campus
firewood. Hawn said. The bulk of
the wood was dumped though,
Hawn explained, because it is
cheaper to purchase firewood than
to pay the labor costs of cutting,
drying, and storing the wood over
the year or two necessary to make
good firewood.

Approximately 500 trees have
been planted over the last two to
three years, which were purchased
through contributions, Hawn said.
Trees lost in the Storm will have to
be replaced with donations also,
Hawn said. The repair and clean
up costs will be paid out oi the
general operating budget or the
physical plant. So lar, the labor
costs in clean up have been ap-
proximately $1,000, Hawn
estimated.

The ice coats nature’s product In a while But trees,

Yet pulls and strips and tears branches Realize their icy beauty brings
Away what is most beautiful. Become dull, no lasting

Those some trees which in-

The glistening beauty attracts

And entrances "‘9' With rich autumnal colors, To repair the damage and hide

To the cluttered ground, ' That gaze upward
Cluttered with what has been Using sensuous curves At their unstable branches.

forsaken for beauty, Magnified in icy light,
Nature overpowers us,
And herself.

And so they allow the sun
To warm their smile
And brighten their eyes.

Beauty?

Pure emotion? .

Hoth files
court appeal

by T. Elaine Carey

Sandra l-loth. assistant prolessor
oi physical education, has filed a 19
point appeal at decisions by the
lowa State Civil Rights Com-
mission and Grinnell College in the
District Court of Iowa for
Poweshiek County.

President A. Richard Turner and
Dean of the College Waldo Walker
have been named as respondents
for the college in the appeal.

The appeal protests the linding
of the Civil Rights Commission
investigation of Hoth's denial of
tenure and termination of em-
ployment by the college and the
college’s decision to do both, she
said.

Hoth’s complaint to the com-
mission charged sex
discrimination was the reason for
her termination, she said. The
commission investigated her
complaint and found “no probable
cause," she said.

Hoth is appealing the com-
mission's decision because the
commission never considered or
answered, in their case summary,
her complaint against the college
that she was never given the op»
portunity to deiend herself, have a
hearing by the Executive Council.
or hear or answer any charges.
Hoth said.

in not considering her lack of
opportunity tor defense, the
commission has denied Hoth the
constitutional right to iace one’s
accuser, she said.

Walker said an appeal procedure
was set up to which Hath agreed.
However, Hoth said she “only
agreed under duress" and
because time was short as it was
the end of the year. “I told him that
i didn't lee] it was any way to
handle an appeal," because the ad-
hoc subcommittee set up was
comprised ol tour Executive
Council members who had made
the original decision.

The subcommittee of the council
reviewed with Hath her grounds

. for wishing to have a full review by

the council, Walker explained. The
committee determined that Hoth’s
grounds were procedural ones
having to do with incomplete
evidence and improperly done

evaluations of Both.

The committee, alter reviewing
the case and evidence, recom-
mended that the Executive Council
not hear her appeal, because her
procedural grounds were un-
lounded, Walker said. The
procedures were complete and
thorough, according to the com-
mittee. The Executive Council
accepted the recommendation and
reiused to hear her appeal. Walker
said.

At that time, the committee
asked Hoth if sex discrimination
was one other grounds for appeal.
Walker said. She responded no,
Walker stated.

Hoth said that it was true she
was not claiming sex
discrimination. at the time,
because discrimination’was not

, ‘one orthe grounds on which the ‘

college would allow her to base an
appeal. Hoth did say, though, that
she then told Walker that she
believed sex discrimination was
involved,

When Hath took her case to the
Civil Rights Commission, sex
discrimination was the only ground
on which she could appeal, l-lotb
explained. The commission had no
mechanism for appealing the
decision procedure used at the
college in the case, while the
college had no mechanism for
dealing with sex discrimination,
Hoth said. That is Why the dif~
lerence in grounds appears in the
two appeals. Hoth added.

A third major point. in the court
appeal, according to Hoth, is that
the commission claimed Hoth was
hired as a coach. However, Hath
claims this is “erroneous" because
she ”oiiicially never had a con-
tractual relationship with the
college as a coach.” Walker said
that. although no intercollegiate
athletic women’s teams existed
when Hnth was hired as an in-
structor, she was to coach teams.
Noting that a question at semantics
is involved, Hath said she was
assigned to be an “instructor of an
interest group." The term
“coach," to people in her
prolession. applies only to one who
coaches on an intercollegiate
basis, she explained.

Charging sex discrimination in
salaries in the Physical Education
Department, Hoth said the com-
mission also failed to “properly
explore" some items in her petition
dealing with salaries, The two
women at the department. in-
cluding herseli, “have by far the
lowest salaries" and yet both have
been here a long time, Hath said.
The remaining members of the
department are male. one who has
been here much less time than
either women and yet receives a
higher salary, Hour said. Walker,
when asked if sex discrimination
existed in the department’s
salaries, responded, “i don’t think

Finally, Hoth said the appeal
asks that the recommendation of
the commission be set aside and
that she “be granted tenure and
compensatory compensation to
rectify past wage discrimination."

The appeal, filed February 25.
must he heard within 45 days after
filing.
