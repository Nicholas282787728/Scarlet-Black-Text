Twenty years after being withheld by a
nervous administration, the controversial
I966 Grinnell yearbook will finally be
released later this month.

But this volume, simply titled "Grinnell
College: 1966" bears little resemblance to
a conventional collcgc annual. it contains
no organization or faculty pictures — and
no senior pictures, ,

It’s a photo essay or college life in those
jays,” said Co-editor Henry Wilhelm. ‘_‘It‘s
as much an artistic work as a Journal): :
one."

Virginia native Wilhelm and J01 \
Phillips, who both enrolled in 1964, cc
lected over 15.000 photographs in compi
ing the work Wilhelm attributes tht
tremendous amount 01 time they spent in
preparing the volume to the iact that both
were dismissed from school lor academic
reasons in 1966.

The result oi their work, he says, was a
genuine and spontaneous portrait oi colr
legc lite m 1966. Others reinforce that
view: in the introduction to the new edi-
tion, history proiessor Joseph Wall says.
“As the contents graphically demonstrate.
it is a remarkable record of what we can
now see in retrospect was a remarkable
year."

But the volume stirred controvery even
before it came under the administration’s
scrutiny, Wilhelm recalled that their
troubles began when the American Prin-

the college rellmilig the iirni oi libel

The pictures in the volume include
photographs or student drug use, beer par
ties. and a male and a female student leayr
ing a motel together

The college‘s COulISeli local attorney,
John Bierman, agreed with the printer.
writing: "It is my opinion that the general
law of libel does noti in itself, make pics
lures. per sc. libelous, however, when
the pictures are accompanied by editorial
comments, then the material becomes
libelous "

.Consequently. Leggctt‘s tinal decision
not to print the yearbook under the
auspices oi Grlnliell College sprung lrom
concern over potential libel suits.

“The primary issue was not one oi your
nalistic competence or taste, but rather
the existence or nonexistence of libelous
material , . . there was a need tor a legal.
not an editorial judgement."

In a recent interview, Wilhelm
disregarded Bierman’s ruling, saying the
attorney was ignorant oi relevant libel
laws, He characterized Leggett's actions
as censorship,

“The college hadn't adjusted to the new
student morality." he said.

Wilhelm credits President Drake and
Tom Lannom, class at '66, with encourage
ing the resurrectoin oi the yearbook.

“In a way, this is their way ofmaking up
for the problems we had belore," he said.

Similar to Rupp's move to Canada.
Babener's move is a return home to her
native northwest, Moreover, Babener also
said that she desires to be in a place that
would aiiord her more opportunities for
research

Yet Babener is quick to point out that
salary was “not instrumental" in her deci»
sion to accept the Montana State position.
Babener said, “I'm very happy at Grinnell
and it was a very difficult decision.”

Babener said that “in the past the job

She added that with the tight job market
