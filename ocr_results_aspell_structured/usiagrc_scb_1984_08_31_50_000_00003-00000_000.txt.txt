0n the Waterfront

By Kevin MoKeough

An acknowledged classic of American cinema. “On the Walerlronl"
is the brutally [rank story of corruption and murder within New York‘s
longshoremen's union and one man's reluctant but courageous attempt
to bring it to an end This 1954 drama stars Marian Brando as 'l'erry
Malloy. a tailed boxer-turnedhoodlum who testifies against his power»
lul union boss.

widely considered to be among his greatest perlormances. Brando's
appearance as Terry became one of the roles with which he is mosl
oiten identified. Accompanying Brando with equally excellent work are
L ee J. Cobb as the powerlul, criminal union boss. Rod Steiger as Terry‘s
brother and betrayer. and Karl Maiden and Eva Marie~Saint as the
crusading priest and compassionate young woman who help bring
Terry back to decency and self-respect,

inspired by a series oi exposes published at the time. i-:lia Kazan's
direction at Budd Schulbcrg's script transcends mere melodrama
through its portrayal oi Terry as a limited. victimized. but ultimately
triumphant hero Kazan's objective depiction of the evils pervading the
waterfront docks avoids sensationalism and sentimentality. leading
many cri cs to cite “0n the Waterfront" as one or the linest examples
of the trad! ion oi film realism developing at the time, One the Water-
frcut: Friday .South Lounge; Saturday. [0:30, South Lounge.

Stir Crazy

stir Crazy is a successful comedy in which Richard Pryor and Gene
w ilder portray unfortunales who are erroneously imprisoned for a banlr
robbery. Innocent of the crime and naive of the temperament and at»
titudes at criminals, Pryor and wilder provide many entertaining
scenes as they acquaint themselves with the environment and the peer
ple in a harsh federal penitentiary.

The “convicts” quickly realize that their only chance tor survival in
this world into which they have been thrust. is to “get tough,“ The
scenes that tallow e in which Pryor and Wilder attempt to convince
their cellmates of their (actually limited) machismo by repeating the
phrase. “We bad" have provided many laughs both in the beater and
beyond.

Alter iamiliarizing themselves with survival in prison. and alter en-
countering many curious and humorous inmates. Pryor and Wilder
discover a way to rectity the injustice done to them — a way to escape
tram the prison.

They realize that the prison has an annual rodeo tor the entertainment
at both the inmates and the public. it Pryor and Wilder can use the
minimum security situation, they will have a chance to escape.

Pryor and Wilder are able to turn an unjustsituation into an amusing
one, and they are able to provide a good ligl" comedy with Stir Lrazy:

The King of Hearts

whether King ol hearts is an exceptional movie has been questioned.
Taking place in provincial France during WWI. King or Hearts attempts
to be an antiwar statement. Alan Bates stars as a soldier who stumbles
into a town in which. due to the war. the only people remaining are those
train a lunatic asylum. The “crazies" have taken over the roles of the
ordinary citizens

As the film progresses, it becomes apparent to all mantis difficult to
determine who is atually more crazy — the citizens from the asylum or
the soldiers. in this way, the movie tries to influence its original i967 aur
dience With anti-war sentiment.

The tilm's limited success is due to the fact that the film drags
somewhat, and to the tact that the soldiers are not represented iairly —
thus not proving that soldiers are actually as insane as the director
would like the audience to believe.

The movie can be praised. however. in its success as a “heart-
warmer," and its periodic success as a comedy. King oi lleal is. Satur-
day, 10:3“ AKll Auditorium: Sunday. 9:30, South Lnungc.
