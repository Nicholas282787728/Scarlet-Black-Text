Featuring contemporary music
for the trumpet, this Friday’s faculty
concert \\lll showcase the talent of
Jonathan Knight, Marlys Boote,len«
nifct Ratchford Sholtis, and George
l<rcm. The concert will consist large.
Iy oftiyentietltcentury music forthe
trumpet anti organ, tiumpet and pi.

bone

According to Jonathan Knighti
uthe trumpet has a bit ota repertoire
problem," with the bulk or trumpet
music written in the Baroque periori
and very little in the nineteenth cen«
tury.

“in the nineteenth century, the
ptInCIpalInstrumentswetepiancand
strings, and those composers who
wrote tor brass were the exception,"
Knight said. “in the twentieth cen-
tury, however. composer’s became
interested in writing really first class
stuff for winds."

Now, most otthe trumpets rep.
ertoite can be found in twentieth
centurycontemporarymusic.agenre
that can best be described Knight
said,“bytheproliferationofdifferent
types or styles."

Written by composer Daniel
Pinkharn are two pieces for trumpet
and organ, one called “Short Volun—
tary," and the other called “Other
Voices of the Trumpet." The latter

incorporates the sounds of trumpet,
organ, and electronic tape. “Other
Voices" was, according to Knight,
“apparently inspired by a verse iron
the Book of Revelation.” and is full
ot‘enci—otrtinie imagery," A Piiiltham
piece based on the Biblical Genesis
story was also performed last seiiiese
tot by the orinneli singers and the
Philadelphia Brass.

Also on the program are Allen '

Hovhannis' piece for trumpet and
organ called “Pray-erofSt. Gregory,"
and Jan Koetsiet's {our movement
“Partita” tor trumpet, piccolo and
organ. The “Partitagi is "a tongue.
in<cheek take offon Baroque music."
said Knight, and is a combination of
“what sounds like Baroque and CH‘CUS
music,"

Alec Wilder’s “Suite for Piano
anthumpEt"\Vill:ilso be performed,
anti is, according to Knight, ”an int
teresting flip-ﬂop between classical
andlazz music." It Will be followed by
Carlos Chavez’ “Soli IV," a piece for
achamberensemble. Anexamplcof
twentieth—century avant garde mut
sic, “Soli IV" presents each member
of the ensemble as a soloist. and is
“challenging both to play and to l|5<
ten to," Knight said.

The concert (8:00pm. Herrick
Chapel) Wlll conclude with Francis
Poulenc's “Sonata for Horn, Trum<
pet and Trombone," a three move.
ment piece that is “characteristic of
Poulenc’s work," Knight said, "and is
very witty and fun to play."

Seek the lounge for comfort

ERIN PETERSON
COLUMNIST

It is midnight. After 32 consec-
utive hours of homework, meetings
and email. you have decided to re«
turn to your room ( if you can remem—
her where it is) in search ofa caffeine
ated beverage, or perhaps your bed,
whichever comes tirst. Probably. you
areregrettingyourdccisiontoattend
otinnell, and are reconsidering the
merits otthat vocational college that
your aunt Hilda so highly tecom»
mended (which, oddly enough, has
approx iiiiately the same name tecog<
nitionasGrinnell) Asyou trudge up
(otdown) that final flight orstairs in
poetic despair, your hear yoices and
laughter. You realize that, in collec—
tive exasperation, your ﬂoor has giv»
en up on their homework and every
one is now sitting in the lounge.
Sinking into one ofthose plush, sev—
en—thousantl ololiat genuine leather
couches you will forget, tor a tow
minutes at least, that you are merely
becoming involved in a socialization
process stratified into hierarchies, os
theorized by Marx and Weber and
Derbet and Nixon And then you
join with your ﬂootmates in a
thoughtful and witty analysis of Ar«
istotle‘s Poetics,

At least, that's how it always

turns out for rne.Though ﬂoor loung—
es are often merely hangouts (Oi first-
yeats, there are also lame, anti—social
upper-class students like myself who
add to the floor dynamics. Volatile
floor mixes leari to always intriguing
discussions, which lend themselves
to unintelligible (but usually sexual—
ly charged) quote board material.

 

 

 

 

(One of my personal favorites is “I
hate my pelvic bonel”) it matters
little whether you scored a loggia
room in Loose or ended way, way up
on Norris fourth (not that I would be
speakingfromblttctpctsonalexpen—
ence), because your floorwill see you
atyourbest.andmostly,atyourwoist.
Atter completing those tour papers
and 56 late calculus assignments, they
will watch you consume huge

lLDRE'N

amounts of repulsive food in CElEbrar
tion, and they will not make fun of
you. (”Goodness, did I actually eat
that butterscotch iced donut and an
entire bagof nacho cheese popcorn .7")
On your floor, you can read month
old issues of Sassy and not be ridi—
culed, (“Fashion: Red is Righteous!"
and “Quiz: “Does He Really Like
Mel")

it doesn’t take a study break to
get a dozen armchair philosophers to
voice their opinions on life, death,
and rude food service employees. In
fact, lhave spent the better part of an
hour discussing the merits of Frosted
Mini Wheats over Ftoot Loops. lfa
scandalous biography of me is ever
wtirten, itwillprobablybe byafloor—
mate with a grudge. I am not often at
peak eloquence while sitting in the
lounge late Monday nights.

Even so, my floor is also the
place where I laugh, whetel listen to
life stories. where I express my fears
ancl where I know i can always go for
emotioiialsuppott.While mysociol—
ogy class struggles to define family,
I’ve got my definition all figured out.
it may seem silly, but when my par—
ents and relatives are five hours away
for nine months of the year, the
concept of family sometimes doesn‘t
have to rely on biology. Sometimes
all that it requires is a lounge and a
bag of nacho cheese popcorn.
