THE NEW sr.
' The action of the Lantern in taking
the ﬁrst step toward the establish»
maul. of a more workable and just
system [if self government among the
men of the college is one uf the most’
encouraging signs of healthy growth
that we have seen here within recent
years. Camposed of eight seniors,
[“70 jumbrs and two faculty members,
it is an organization in which is cen-

vory clearly what the Klan does: '

f‘It supports tnc‘doctriue that oh-
scure and anonymous men have the
fright to regulate the most private acts
Iand even the most pr ate opinions
lot their hetiel‘s; it maintains Lhati
as a. fun'dsinental principle of law:
that an unpopular man has no rights
, in the courts; it resists any and every
differentiation of American from
iAmerican on cultural, religious and,
,etlinic grounds; most important of all,
in teaches that it is good morals and
good sportsmanship tor thirty or
‘forty men to arm themselves, put on
‘fitlse faces, and then go out and ilie
‘use a. man who is alone and un-
'armed."
‘ The action and purpose of the Klan

is thus somewhat ironically stated,

but there is, a great deal of truth in
spite of sonic slight exaggerations.
But the most significant statement to
be round in this discussion of the
lKlztu is this-

“The current agitation against the
Klan is chiefly carried on, not by men
who are genuinely opposed to the:
principles we have rehearsed, but;
siniply by men whose oxen happen to.
he red. Under different circum»)
stances they would advocate and prince
tice the very acts that the Klan is
now accused of. Nine-tenths or them,
in tmth, have advocated and practiced
such acts at some time or other in
the past"

too inclusive, but it brings to our at-
