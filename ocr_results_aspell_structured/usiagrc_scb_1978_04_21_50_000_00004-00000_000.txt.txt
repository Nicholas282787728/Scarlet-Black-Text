Another dead issue?

“I am writing to you on behalf of the Trustees of Grinnell College,
which is a stockholder in this company The purpose of this letter is
both to convey to you our deep concern about (his company’s business
involvement in South Africa in view of the racial policies and laws of
that country, and also to request an explanation of just how you as the
managers or this business view the consequences and responsibilities
(ii that involvement."

So stated a “letter of concern" sent this week by Fritz
Maytag, representing Grinnell's Board of Trustees, to the
chairmen of the boards of 17 major companies that do
business in South Africa and in which Grinnell holds stock.

At its mid-winter meeting late last February. the board
announced its intention to send such a letter in order to
investigate “what steps these companies are taking, and
what steps they intend to take in promoting racial equality
in South Africa.” (8&8, March 3, 1978)

WHILE IT seems to us that the letter. drafted by trustees
Fred Little and Maytag, need not have taken nearly two

months to prepare, it is encouraging that a letter has been
sent to these companies demanding an account of their
activities regarding human rights. It shows a willingness on
the part of the board's finance committee, an understandably
conservative body in light of the financial difficulties
presently faced by many educational institutions, to begin
moving towards using the college's inﬂuential position as
stockholder to insure responsible action from those com-
panies in which it invests.

While this week's Maytag letter is a cautious and ten»
tative step by the board, we find it a heartening one. It
marks for the first time the board's consideration of a
humane, responsible investment policy, and a significant
departure from their previously espoused philosophy that
the college as an institution could not take a stand on
complex political issues. It remains to be seen, of course,
what the board does once it receives the information it has
requested. but at least the companies now know that their
corporate activities concerning human rights are a concern of
this college.

MAYTAG, as the board's investment monitor, is in
charge ofhandling all of the proxy votes for the college. And
this must be a busy time for him, for April and May are
traditionally when most stockholders meetings are held.

Aside from the usual motions included in the proxy
statements, a large number of proxies this year contain

shareholder resolutions calling for the various companies to
reveal, account for and a ' 55 their positions on a number of
rather complex and political issues.

These stockholder resolutions do not all deal specifically
with South Africa. For example, there is an upcoming ITT
shareholder's resolution demanding that the company

divulge the extent of its involvement in the political affairs of
Chile. And there is another resolution before General

Electric mandating that that company reveal the amount of
minorities and women currently employed, as well as their
salaries relative ’to the salaries of white males in similar
positions. And these are but two of many.

IT is Maytag's responsibility to study the proxies and to
recommend to the board's iinancecommltteewhether the
college should consider supporting any of the shareholder
proposals, But, as he admitted last February, he would
probably do so very infrequently and with great caution. He
did state. however. that he wanted to hear what students felt
about the validity and the worth of the various proposed
~tockho|ders resolutions. And he still does.

The proxies are presently being held at the Treasurer‘s
Office and are open to Viewing during regular business hours.
ls‘cw students, however. seem Lo care. For all the hue and cry
surrounding the question of South African investments
earlier this year, less than a dozen students have taken the
time or had the interest to view the proxies, according to.
Robert Anderson. college treasurer. More and more this
issue. like so many others these days, appears to have just
been a fad. of only passing interest, more symbolic than
substantive. And that‘s a shame.

interested students can still view the proxies, and
Maytag is more than willing to receive opinions from
students recommending possible avenues of action for the
Lhe college. Upcoming shareholder motions of note include
one concerning lTT's activities in Chile (to he
voted May 10] and a shareholder motion to he introduced at
{he May 4 Mobil Oil annual meeting concerning direcL and
indir ‘t shipments of oil to Rhodesia.

it's not too late to submit letters of opinion to Maytag on
these and other shareholder motions. The board. as a result
of the persistence and amount of campus concern expressed
on the question of investment accountability. is moving
towards a lnore responsible stance concerning its in-
vestments policy. The students who spurred this movement
have a responsibility, indeed a commitment, to see it through
and to prevent this from becoming just another dead issue.
