Women’s Athletics Emphasized

The Midwest Conterencetacully
representatives approved atthe con-
ference’s semi-annual meeting last
week a resolution encouraging ”a
strong women’s program in inter
collegiate athletics” and, at the
same time, provrding for the posts
bility of women on men’s teams in
“exceptional cases.”

The resolution, which was pre-
sented by Carleton College, was pass
sed unanimously by the faculty rer
presentatives from the conference's
ten colleges.

The resolution provided “That ex,
ceptional cases be decided lndlvldr
ually and On their merits and that
the commissioner be instructed to
appoint a Commission ottwo men and
two women to hear and decide on such
cases,”

The faculty representatives pres
faced the proposals with the state-
ment that “the conference recoge
nizes, for practical purposes and for
physical reasons that the normal
channel for intercollegiate compe-
tition for men is through the men’s
program and tar women is through
the women’s program ”

They then called up the league “to
take active steps to encourage the
the development oi a strong women’s
program in intercollegiate athle—
tics."

The representatives said that the
commission to hear “exceptional
cases” would be guided, iirst, by
the welfare of the student and, sec,
and, by the effect on the athletic
programs ior both men and women
at the student’s school,
