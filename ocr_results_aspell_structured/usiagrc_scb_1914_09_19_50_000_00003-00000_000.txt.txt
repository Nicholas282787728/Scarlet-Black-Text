Grinnell’s Ideal of Education
Treated Yesterday.

Grinuell's ideal of educatiun and de-
mocracy was the theme of President
Maill’s Friday morning Chapel address.

”I feel conﬁdent," he said, “that
everyone, if he ﬁnds a position and
Works hard. by the time he is {or
will ﬁnd a place nf great digllii
and usefulness in the world. But work
is of little Importance unless It shuws
true spirit; thus, Griuuell wishes to
give men a chance to develop them-
selves into mastelspilils to bl mg the
inner and outer W'Olld into spiritual
harmony

oi this college lite.

”Calling of Dan Matthews” Com.
ing Soon.

The dramati tion or "The Calling
or Dnn Matthews," nhieh comes to the
Colonial Theatre on Wednesday, 85117
toniber 23, is so hell known as a hook
that it is utterly unnecessary to give
a detailed description of the plot, as
every reader of Harold Bell Wright's
Stories, and their name is legion, hxs
read "The Calling of Dan Matthews."

In it, we ﬁnd the familiar and well
loved scenes, races and names we Inel-
with in "The shepherd ot the Hills.”
The play helongs to the twentieth een-
tul'y and like all of Mr. Wright's star»
ies, when put-into playing form makes
an intensely interesting and pawerlul
acting drama. ~.

Dan Farr, exr’ls. is spending a ten-
days with Grinllell trientls.
