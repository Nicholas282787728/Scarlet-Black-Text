Senatorial Candidatesto Be Hotly
Discussed in Political Debate
On November 6.

“Resolved: That the voter in the
coming election should cast his,vote
for Herring rather than Brookhart for
United states Senator" is the interest-
ing and most timely subject chosen for
the Merrill political debate this year,.
which will be held on Monday, Novem-
ber s; between lonian and Institute
literary societies. Ionian will uphold
the affirmative of the question and
institute the negative. The length of
the main speeches will be 7, 7, and 3
minutes and of the rebuttal speeches
l, l, and is minutes.

The Merrill Debate was founded by
Mr. G. W. Merrill several years ago
find a prize is given to the team that
does the most effective debating upon
some live political issue, either na—
tional.or local. Last year the ques-
tion for the debate concerned the
policy of the United States in the Dis—
armament Conference. Ionian won
from Chresto 4 to 1 in this debate.

The debate this year is one of vital
interest, as there are a good many stu-
dcnts of voting age in the college. It
i. one which should prove a live and
stormy topic for discussion.

At a meeting of the Debating Union
Monday night it was decided that no;
men’s society shall pledge a man or,
elect him into the society until afteri
four. open meetings- Thcse open
meetings will start in all of the soci—
eties tonight. The elections of new
members will take place at the ﬁfth
meeting of the year. All pledging
is to be discouraged and it is asked
that no freshman make a pledge until
freshmen intending to join a literary
society should make it a point to v' it
each of the four societies whether he
has an invitation or not. In this
way each society will be given ample
time to consider ench man carefully.

The Debating Union is formulating
a new constitution which will be
completed soon. It is hoped that
when this constitution goes into ef—
fect many of the disadvantages of the
old system, which was really not
much of a system at all, will be
eliminated. New plans are also under
way which will make‘ for a more
healthy development of the literary
societies.
