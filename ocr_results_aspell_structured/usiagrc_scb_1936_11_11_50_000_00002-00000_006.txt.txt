About Rockne’s System

Some 40 major colleges and universities in the country use the Notre Dame system of
football, and use it successfully. An offensive system of football is nothing more or less
than a means of getting the ball into play. It is a pretty well established fact that material
is more likely to make the system than the system is to make the material. In other words.
if you don't have football players, or lads who can be taught to play football, no system
will work. And if you happen to have a hunch ufsuper'men. any system will work,

The Notre Dame system, developed by the late Knute Rockne, and spread over the
country, has enjoyed such success, however, that its use is steadily lncreasmg, even though
Rockne has been dead (or some ﬁve years. Besides the army of Notre Dame graduates who
are teaching the hOP‘Shlft method of getting a play started in the institutions of higher
learning. many others are introducing it to rhe high school ﬁelds, Still other men. graduates
of schools besides Notre Dame which used the system, are spreading this rhythmic, color-
ful oﬂ‘enslve weapon throughout the country.

The team hops from the huddle into the formation shown here, the

line balanced, the backs in the characteristic T formation, and the
ends slightly split. The T formation of the hacks, from which quick opening plays and
plays on which due quarterback handles the ball may be run, is. like the balanced line,
characteristic of the Notre Dame system. While the signal for the play to be run has been
given in the huddle, the quarterback calls another set to give the cadence of the hoptsliift

guard on this play, a characteristic Notre Dame end run, must get into the picture ahead of
the quarterback. When it is remembered that one of the chiefcharacteristics of the system
is speed, one gains an idea of how fast he must move to keep ahead of the halfback, who in
turn must be off before a defensive lineman can shoot through the hole just vacated by the
guard. The end iun is the real basis of the Notre Dame system. With the play going either
