Students discuss issues of poverty

BY CHRISTIAN CAMlNlTl

The World Bank defines “moderate poverty” as living
on less than two U.S. dollars it day, but the International
Students Organization (ISO) begs to differ,

On the ﬁnal day of the Poverty Symposium this past
week, the ISO presented “International Perspectives on
Poverty,” a panel in which six members gave firsthand ac-
counts ofsocioeconomie conditions in their home country.

The reports illustrated the many and varied face ofpovv
erty, while also subverting Western notions ofwhat makes
an impoverished foreign nation.

ness about how what is deﬁned as

150 member Biva Rajbhandarl ’12 of Nepal said the
“dollar exhibit” lends itself to a more refined portrayal of
poverty than the statistical indicators that many ofus use.
“Poverty depends on culture. In Nepal, we don’t have
washing machines beeause people wouldnt use it—they
would say washing machines are less effective," Rajbhan—
dari said. "To classify the Nepalese as impoverished be—
cause they do not have washing machines would be inaee
curate." Rajbliandarl carried with her an elegant Nepalese
picture frame that cost almost a dollar.

yes it happens but there is so much

As part ofthe presentation, ISO
displayed a number of items from
across the globe that could be bought for one us. dollar
in hopes of demonstrating that cultural habit should die
rate the definition ofpoverty, rather than a ﬁxed monetary
amount.

Items on display that amounted to one dollar included
a bunch ofbangles from India. a can of CocmCola, a news-
paper and a pack of cigarettes from Egypt, as well as a bag
ofehips tron. the U.S.

“We're trying to show a dollar can range from a good
meal to a pack of cigarettes to a string bracelet. We're try-
ing to show that a dollar is not cheap in other countries and
the deﬁnition ofpoverty is not properly defined," said ISO

“In Latin America, farmers don’t
wear shoes. It‘s not they are impov-

trade amongst other farmers,” said
ISO member Luis Vallejo '13, “If the image ofa shoeless
farmer is on TV, people will assume the farmer is |mpOV*
erished.”

Although “International Perspectives on Poverty" may
he ISO's most visible contribution to the Poverty sympo-
siumr their ambition to portray the experience of poverty
in a realistic and culturally informed manner extends far
beyond the presentation.

on Friday, the group will be holding a fundraiser for
“Every Child is My Child" and next week they will be
screening a series of documentaries that deal with issues of
international poverty. all are encouraged to attend.
