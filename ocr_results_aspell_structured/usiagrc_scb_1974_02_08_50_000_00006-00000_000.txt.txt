Internship Program Attracts Three Students

by Louise Dix

Three sophomores took advantage
of internships given by Grinnell
Couege 'alumni in the San Franr
cisco Bay area over the winter or
eak. Mark Homrighausen. Laura
Nance, and Cathy Hill spent several

weeks familiarizing themselveswith l

various professions such as law,te»
aching and chemistry.

Laura Nance, a general science
and biology major, worked with al-
umnist Tom Cech at Berkeley, ob—
serving various laboratory techni—
ques with graduate students, She
said that her internship included
a lot of paper work and reading,
but due to liability problems, she
was not allowed to work directly
with the equipment. Many oi the
experiments dealt with ultracentrir
fugatlon and one longer experiment
,dealt with the isolation of pure DNA
from mice

“I learned a lot that Iwouldn’t
have had the opportunity to learn.
The lab techniques were pertormed
to reach concepts I've beenlearning
from books,” she remarked Nance
explained that the professors put
into practice the theories she had
been learning here.

“I’m a little more motivated to do
work myself now,” she said “It’s
so interesting.” She added that she
thought she might want to go to a
graduate school and she reallywanr
ted to feel the general atmosphere
of grad work. “it seems a lot more
natural to me now," Nance stated.

Mark Homrighausen said that he
too felt more comfortable, but in
this case, with office work, nctgrad
school. He worked with Neil Horton
in the Johnston, Klein, Horton and
Solomon law firm. Theworkentailed
doing menial tasks and research
for the firm as well as sitting in
on court and administrative hearr
ings.

“1 helped research cases they we
re actually working on at thetime,"

Homrighausen commented, He said
that they had him look up related
cases and then Horton would dis-
cuss the facts and various appro—
aches for handling such a case.
Homrighauseh said that his menial
tasks consisted olhelplngtheyoung-
est attorney who was given all the
researching to do, by calling people
and going to the law library.

“1 deﬁnitely got a lot out or it,”
he said. ”Out of the work and di5v
cussing it with Neil and lgota lot
just by being around the office and
seeing how the day was conducted,
the work everyone did and how they
acted toward each other.”

He said that at first he felt as if
he couldn’t do anyihingnavmg really
no experience in law,buthesaidthey
didn’t make him leel “underfoot."
"I discovered that the work i was
doing was not horribly valuable but
it was still kind oi useful and i
was really getting involved. Iwasn’t
just a burden ”

Homrighausen was the only intern
in the office so he got to know the
lawyers very well, especially Here
ton. “We'd go to lunch and meet
ings together, and I could walk into
any or the offices anytimelwanted,”
he said.

Cathy Hill attended Chabot Collr
ege. a junior college, and worked
with Professor Edward Stamford.
She said that she mostly sat in on
his classes in American, Latin Am-
erican, and Californian Indian His-
tory. “I got an idea of what it’s
like to be a teacher," she com-
mented She said that she had the
ought about going into the teaching
profession to teach Russian andthis
program gave her a better idea or
what teaching entails. But she said,
”i don‘t want to worry right now
about what I'm actually gomgtodo ”

Hill said that this was her first
visit to California and site enjoyed
visiting the area. She said that she
lelt her stay would have been more

worthwhile if she had been allowed
to maybe help the prolessor with
his lesson planning instead of just
observing his teaching methodsBut
she said that he was writing a book
on Caliiornian history and she got
“the feeling of that," too.

All three recommended thelnternr
ship program highly. “It you ever
have the smallest interest in sum»
ething or just want to know what
it’s like, this program’s great,”
Stated Homrighausen. ”It gave me
a much broader View and a more
comfortable feeling about office
work It isn't all that horrible; at
least that was my reaction." He
said he is not sure if he wants to
go into law, but due to this exper~
ience, he ”certainly became very
interested in it.” “I’d like to do
this kind or program and try out
things like the foreign service or

state department work, city plan
ning or teaching perhaps, " he con~
eluded /‘

“I really recommend this pro-
gram,” Nance Said. “And I hope
they offer a lot more in different
fields.H She said it helped tier
figure things out about graduate
school and going into a science li—
eld.

Hill Said that she got a lot out of
the history courses she sat in on.
She found the Californian history
course particularly relevant to her
stay. She said that it there were
another programthatinterested her,
she thinks that She might try it.

The internship program oiiers no
pay, housing or transportation. Na-
nce stayed with an aunt and Homrir
ghausen lives in the area so they
had no problem Hill stayed with
her brother a while but had to spr
end a few nights in a motel. She
suggested that perhaps the college
could set it up so that the intern
could stay at one alumnist's house
while working for another.

The recording era of one or Amv
erica's premier rock bands, CF
eedence Clearwater Revival, spans a
period or almost seven years, the
finale of which is a tw0vrecord
live set recorded during their Fall,
1971. tour of Europe. In many ways.
Creedence Clem-water Revival Live
in Europe (Fantasy CCer) is ac.
tually a better ”greatest hits” colr
lection than either of the surprise
ingly mismatched Fantasy reissues
previously available, Creedeuce
Gold and More Creedence Gold. All
the big ones are here, from “Suzie
Q” on downto “SweetHltch-Hiker.”
Cree-deuce is probably the only
group in the history or rock music
whose records sound exactly like
their live performances. Every Song
here (with the notable exception of
an overworked thirteenrandm-halt
minute version of “Keep on Choog-
lin' ”) conforms quite well to its
studio version with respect to time
length, a rarity for live albums.
ccn always was the epitome oi
simplicity and preciseness, linked
with an almost uncanny efficiency.
Any Creedence song is obvious
both in music and lyric, and each
song is amazing in that there is
nothing that could betermed excess,
yet nothing is left outeither,Every-
thing necessary is contained in a
two-to-three minute song-momma,

tor a news ieature story on the ecr

were presented the week bi‘Jan-

conference.

The winning news ieature, written
by Director of College Relations
William Deminoff, was based on a
report entitled “The Economic lmr

City or Grinnell. "

Robert A'. Voertmanot theDepartr

no less. The Live In Europe album
iollows this concept faithfully, and
it resultingly becomes one or the
album‘s strongest points.

There is no need to gothrough each
cut individually, ‘cause they all
sound just like the studio versions,
but listening to these discs makes

‘one realize a very obvious(although

perhaps ,not terribly important)
fact about CCR. The point is that
Creedence was just another name
for John Fogerty, just as today
he is the Blue Ridge Rangers. This
new live album does not have or»
other 'i‘orn Fogerty on rhythm gui»
tar, and yet the record doesn't sufr
t'er at all for it. Arter realizing
this, it almost seems that John Fo-
gerty could have done it all alone
if he had wanted to, since his Blue
Ridge Rangers album proves he is
capable of it.

Creedence wasn’t ilashy, gimm-
icky, or inventive at all. They wer-
en‘t Supposed to be, and that’s what
made them so good. There are pr—
obably a good ten thousand bass pl—
ayers and drummers around today
who would have Suited John Fogerr
ty‘s needs as well as Stu Cook and
Doug Cliitord did.

I wouldn't be at all surprised
to read twenty years irom now in
a book called “The Story of Cree
edence Ciearwater Revival," (or
“The John Fogerty Story”--take
your pick) that John played every
instrument ever heard on a studio
record of CCR, then he’d drag out
brother Tom and good friends Stu
and Doug whenever the need tor
touring arose

if you own at least three of Cr-
eedence’s middle period albums
(Bayou Country, Green River, Willy
and the Poorboys,andCosmo'5 Fac—
tory) then you’d be wasting your
money buying this album But if
you’re one of those who always li-
ked Cl‘eedence and never gotaround
to buying their records. because
they were too ”commercial,” iorget
about any peer pressure train the
past and pick up on this excellent
greatest hits collections irom one
or the few truly landmark groups
of late sixties American rock,
