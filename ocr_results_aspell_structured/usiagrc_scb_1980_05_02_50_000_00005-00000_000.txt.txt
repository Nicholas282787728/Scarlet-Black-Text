The case against registration

by Sena/or who Culver

America must manilain a sh nng n.1-
tlonal defense posture, and that re-
quires an ability to mobilize hundreds
Ell thousands of men and women on
short notice in a genuine emergency.
That is why we keep over two million
people on active duty and why we
maintain over 000,000 people in the
Reserves. In addition, we need to be
able to obtain and traln hundreds of
thousands of additional men and
women in the event or a major and
prolonged conilict.

But we do not need peacetime dl'ali
registration to accomplish that goal,
Instead, we can and should improve
our standby capability to mobilize our
iorces ii and when they are actually
needed.

It our national security were truly
threatened, I would expect there to be
tens oi thousand oi patriotic
volunteers. In World War I there
were so many volunteers in the early
days that thousands had to be turned

away. But our current drait contingen-

cy plans assume no additional
volunteers, and thus exaggerate the
potential value and importance 0i
peacetime registration,
Time and again in recent years, our
’ military manpower experts have
testified that we could meet our crisis
requirements without such registrar
tion. A study done in January oi this
year by the Director or the Selective
Service System concluded that prior
registration would speed up the start
of induction and training by at most

peacetime registration was
“redundant and unnecessary."

Some people favor registration as
the iirst step toward resuming the
drait. 1 support the all-volunteer iorce,
and I believe it has been successful
thus tar in attracting Sufficient
numbers and quality oi people into our
active forces, (We do face problems in
retention oi midrcareer personnel and
in keeping up the strength at the
Reserves, and I have supported other
measures to improve those situations.
But registration is not the answer to
those most critical personnel pro-
blems.)

other people iavor registration as a
symbol of our national determination
and preparedness. But it is a symbol
without much substance. We could
better spend our taxpayers’ dollars by
improving our combat readiness, as I
have been advocating throughout my
Service as a member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.

Peacetime draft registration would
add little or nothing to our crisis
capabilities. I believe we can ShDW our
determination and send a signal to
any adversary by strengthening our
standby emergency system so that it
can operate ertectively it needed,

Status of draft legislation

On April 22, the House of Represen-
tatives gave final approval, on a 219 to
180 vote, to a proposal to register
young men this summer. That legislar
tion has now been referred to the
Senate and is pending before the
Senate Appropriations Committee. A
Committee vote on the legislation is
likely in the next two weeks.

Meanwhile, on April 17, the Military
Manpower Subcommittee of the
Senate Armed Services Committee ap-
proved as part of the Defense
Authorization Bill another proposal to
provide funds tor registration oi young

men. The lull Senate Armed Services
Committee is expected to vote on this
registration proposal by May 15 and
send it to the Senate ﬂoor.

At this point, it is not clear which of
these two registration proposals—the
one contained in the bill passed by the
House or the one approved by the
Senate Military Manpower Subcoms

.mtttee—will reach the Senate floor

first for debate. In either case,
however, it seems likely that the
Senate‘s debate on the registration
issue could begin as early as mid»
May.
