W. Houston Dougharty, on settling into Grinnell

WHauimn Dozlglmt‘ly, birctllaxlymr [a rep/nee Tom Clad}! at
Vice President n/s/rwnimﬂaiu, Wild/[y uni‘wd on nmrpnr [tot
wee/t to begin In} tenure.

What were your initial impressions of the Grinnell cams
pus and students when you were interviewing for the posit
tion ofVice President ofStudent Affairs?

The thing that impressed me the most was that when I was
interviewing just at the beginning ofﬁnals week, I was blown
away at the number of students who showed up to meet me.
This was critical beginning of finals week, where folks are
working hard to get ready for exams and writing ﬁnal papers.
and there were 15 to twenty students there for lunch. To me,
that told me a whole lot about how much folks love the place
and how important this place is to them.

I was struck by the warmth ofpeople, people's willingness
to actually engage and have conversations, whether that was
having dinner with faculty or lunch with students. Everyone
seemed very willing to engage and very willing to mcct me
where 1 was, which 1 really appreciated.

Have your perceptions changed at all now that you've
been able to spend more time on campus.>

One ofthc SpCle things about Grinncll that I've bccn able
to sense is that there's a very unique combination cfpcoplc bot
ing very dedicated to this place and loving this place and still
feeling the room to be their own funky sclwtstl don't think
that's a combination you ﬁnd everywherei thinkyou ﬁnd a lot
of places where it’s either/or, where either it's ‘VVe’rc all about
this place and we loose out own identities in it,'ot (We're so
into our own deal we don’t really connect to the community.v
I’m pretty excited about it becauscl like to be proud of the
place where I am,l>ut I also like to be pretty much myself And
to be able to be authentic in a place that also supports you in
that, where you also have commonalities,l think is a pretty
nifty combination to find.

In a previous interview with the stall, you stated you
weren’t coming to Grinnell with an ”agenda for change."
Have you formed new plans since beginning your work
here?

I'm really focused on student learning and engagement.
rm really focused on students achieving their goals and then
dreams. I'm very committed to diversity and to wellness issues.
I’m very focused on how do we work hard, play hard and stay
healthy? 1 think we do the ﬁrst of those two things really well
here, 1 haven't ﬁgured our yet how healthy we are.

From a sraftpcrspecrivc, I’m very interested in figuring out
what our resources are here. I'm very interested in ﬁguring out
what the talents are in the team that I've got and making sure
that we're matching our resources with our challenges, I think
it‘s critical that we be exemplary role models because I think
students learn from us more by watching us then by listening
to us. Proactiviry and intentionality are really important to me.
Life on a college campus can get really wild and really cmzy. I
think that it can get so wild and crazy that you’re constantly
sort of rocked back on your heels, reacting to what's going on.
I‘m very interested in us ﬁyrlng out how we can be intentional
and proactive.

You‘ve indicated in the past that knowing students and
the needs of students is one of your top priorities. What are
some of your plans for getting to know students more?

I think one ofthe most important things for somebody
in a position like I'm in to do is to be present, Showmg up
[at Disco], since Disco is such a huge part of this culture, it
makes sense to check it out. I also hung out at the pub for a
while. 1 think one of the best ways to get to know students is
to be a pait ofrhcir lives. One ofthe things
I’m hoping to do is to spend some nights in
some of the residence halls, to actually see
what it’s like to live in a dorm.

You mentioned that you stoppcd-by
Disco.

Yes, I went for about lmlfan hour.

What did you think?

Well, you know I lived through disco,
so it was interesting seeing part of my own
personal history relived, in terms ofthc way
folks were dressing. I didn't cxpcct to hear
the Bangles. 1 was cxpccting morC Donna
summer. Obviously it was an eclectic mus
sicitl mix, but it seemed likt: folks were haw
ing a great timz. I ﬂew in about ten o'clock and got to Disco
at about eleven. A few students who I had met before walked
up and said, ‘This is awkward.'l asked, ‘It is?’ They said,
‘Yeah, normally administrators and faculty don't come hang
out at our partiesxt said, ‘Well, I'm not checking up on you.

from p. 1

what he called “divisive social issues."

“I was hoping to get away from those kind of things and
work on things like improving education,” said Palmer. “one
of the things we promised [in 2006] was to raise teacher pay,
and we did."

Education improvement is also a goal of Carroll: as part
of his broader focus on the economy. “lfwe create an environ»
ment that’s attractive
to business investment,
we have to supply
workers who are well-
educated and ready to
go to work," said Cat-
roll, who emphasized

”lfwe create an environment
that’s attractive to bit/mess
investment we have to tupp/y
workers who are well educated ”

his support of Iowa’s

formerstate rep. and worktorce training
system.

A more conten-
tious subject might be government spending. Palmer talks up
his support for new spending initiatives, including expanded
preschool, higher teacher pay and expansion of the state health
care system.

“Yes raising teacher pay, it did cost some money,“ Palmer
said. “We could have said, ‘No thank you,’but our teachers were

42nd or 43rd in the nation in teacher pay.”He said that the new
spending programs reﬁected important needs and were paid for
by incrcastd rcvtnuc duc to Iowa’s strong economy

Carroll, in contrast, is running on a position oflow taxes and
low spending. He said that the recent legislature has approved
close to one billion dollars in new spending since 2007. "That
kind of increase in government spending is going to drive up
rhc tax burden, not just on individuals but on business as well,"

on hcalrb care, both support reform but disagree on who
should run Iowa's health care system. Palmer said that he was
proud of the legislature's bills expanding iowa's staterrun health
care to cover all Iowan children by 2011.

Carroll also spoke about reforming Iowa's health care sysr
rem—including making it “portable" so that workers can take
their health care from job to job and across state lincsibut
said that he only supports “market-based solutions," not gore
ernment-providcd health care, “I worry that ifwc get caught up
in healrh insurance solutions that are somehow governments
tunded,wc will end up rationing health car 'he said,

Grinncll students—and the rest of District 75—wtll have
plenty oftime to decide whether they prefer the new incumr
bent or the old before the November election. 1r seems probable
that Palmer and Carroll will have at least one debate on campus
in the fall, allowing students to see the pair in person before
making up their minds.

I’m just sort ofrrying to get the vibeJThey’re like,“Wcll, that’s
cool." 50,1 hung out and chatted for it while. It was fun.
Were students‘intetptetations ofths style accurate?
It was all over the map, but I loved the polyesterl don't

As you settle back into life in Iowa and
among the students of Grinnell, do you
have any ofﬁce decorating plans?

I have lots otstuftyet to come. I've always
been known as having a very ecclectic ofﬁce.
So. if you look across there, there‘s Clarence
“Gatemouth” Brown,, who is my favorite
blues guitarist; John Waters, who is one of
my favorite filmmakers; and David Sedans,
who's my ft orire water. And, you know, my
Big Boy bank collection. You’ll see lots of
pictures of students whom I’ve known over
the years and a lot of whom I stay in contact
with through Facebook, actually. It will be a

pretty eclectic mix in here, so I’m looking forward to that stuff
art-wing.
