cigarettes. Camel was the ﬁrst and
only cigarette that combined all (lie
goodnesses of the choicest Turkish
and Domestic tobaccos, and Camel
became the greatest smoke word of
all ages. No tobacco name com-
pares with Camel.

Camel won and holds its over-
whelming preference through in-
domitable tobacco quality.0iily the
choicest Turkish and Domestic

world’s largest tobacco organiza-
tion could give. Nothing is too
good or too expensive that will
make Camels, regardless of price,
the utmost in cigarettes.

If you have never yet tried
Camels, a new sensation in smok-
ing pleasure awaits you. The sen—
sation of the choicest, the most
perfectly blended tobaccos that
money can buy. Have a Camel!
