ELECTION: Higher StudentTurnout Expected

continued from page 1

“With the excitement that was
generated with the Branstad pro
test,“ he thought students would
vote in larger numbers.

The student tumout might have
inﬂuenced a few local races. Ree
publicans Harry McNaul and Bob
Suftin defeated democrats Dick

Emmert and Mona Bond in the
race for county supervisors.
Emmert was defeated by 95 votes
and Bond by 105. Zoeckler air
tributed this loss, and the victory
of incumbent republican Phil
TyrelloverLzu-ry Hardy,toaheavy
republican tumont in Poweshiek
County’s rural precincts.

Some town residents thought

the students had a highly visible
turnout. and applauded the emphasis
students appeared to have placed
on the election, Both Elizabeth
Fowley and Mick Neubert com—
merited that the students should be
encouraged to vote whereverit was
possible.

“I hope they continue this very
active role as voters,“ said Neubert.

Students celebrate while watching election results in Loose Lounge, The party was sponsored
by the Political Science department in honor of the Tuesday, Nov. 6 Vote.

Other residean were critical of
studentvoters. Beforethcelectiori.
some criLics of the carnpus’ regis-
tration drive claimed that Grinnell
students should not be allowed to
vote in this district on the grounds
that they are temporary residents
and notlikelytobetaxpayers. State
Senate candidate Charles Dunham,
who lost on Tuesday, issued a state-
ment criticizing the students as
“sheep, who are temporary guests
in this district.” Othcrconcems were
expressed about students’ famil-
iarity with the candidates and the
issues, especially in local races.

John Ahmann, a junior from
Missouri, said that he voted al-
thoughhewasunfamiliarwithsome
of the candidates.

“1 saw a couple of [the candi-
dates]," said Ahmann. “I saw
[Dave] Nagle when he was here. I
saw [Terry] Branstad." He knew a
little about the state races. but he
said that he was “not very
informed, especially about the 10-
cal oncs.” For the most part. in the
local elections, Ahmann voted
according to political party
affiliation.

Several town residents were less
concerned about the potential for
uninformed students voting,

Tim Armstrong, a Grinncll rest
dent, said that though some stu~
dents didn't know the candidates.
others were more informed than
many of the town's residents.
