ANOTHER SEASON GONE

In thinking back over the past Grinnell foot—
ball season there are three things which stand
out—the fact that the Pioneers’ victory famine
was brought to an end; the scarcity of varsity
material; and the consistently poor blocking and
tackling which characterized Grinnell play
throughout the season.

By breaking the defeat jinx which has
haunted it for two years, Grinnell has taken the
first step toward recovery of the football glory
which it held in the past. The Pioneers for so
long held a position of dignity in Missouri Valley
and midwestern gridiron circles that they are still
respected by every team they meet, but this sit-
uation could not long exist if local football for-
tunes continued at the present l‘ow ebb. Let it
be hoped, then, that this season marked the end
of Grinnell’s gridiron depression.

The scarcity of candidates proved a handi-
cap in more ways than one. It robbed the men
of the incentive w'hich active competition for the
various positions on the first team should provide.
It deprived the coaches of sufficient men to con-
duct practice scrimmages. It resulted in an in

sufficiency of capable reservesian all-important-

asset in these days of frequent substitutions and
power plays These are not alibis; they are facts
which should be kept in mind when attempting
to judge the season's results fairly.

For the ignorance of gridiron fundamentals
displayed by the Grinnell squad little excuse can
be found. Undeniably this fault proved costly to
Grinneu time and time again, and it can not be
excused on the grounds of a small squad.
Whether insufficient training in fundamentals was
given the men when freshmen; whether the fault
lies on the shoulders of the varsity coaches; or
whether the 1934 crop of Pioneer gridders were
simply less able in this respect than Grinnell
men of the past we will not attempt to say. Pro-
bably the lack of competition for positions on the
team was in part to blame; also it has been sug-
gested that the coaches abandoned intensive
blocking and tackling drills too early in the sea-
son, and members of the present yearling squad
have expres d the opinion that they have been
'given insufﬁ ient work on fundamentals. What—
ever the cause, this weakness of the 1934 team
can and must be corrected in succeeding teams,
or Grinnell‘s progress is bound to be slow.

Every thing considered, though, it may be
truthfully said, “It might have been worse."
There’s another season coming and "hope springs
eternal”~so let’s start laying plans for a bigger
and better season in 1935.

WHY BLAME HOLLYWOOD?

The attack of reformers upon pernicious pic-
tures and block booking is today a subject of
national debate. The movement has taken the
general form of an attack upon producers and
exhibitors of salacious films. The Catholic
church initiated a program of boycott against the
pictures which they considered to be dangerous
to morals, and has been backed by many of the
Protestant churches and civic organizations.

But the campaign against anti-social pictu
will never become effective until it comes closer
to home. It can never attain its objective until
it strikes at the root of the evil. A Study of the
experiences of movie exchanges in key centers
proves that the present public taste calls for sen-
sational and unwholesomb pictures. The lusty
entertainment of Mae West has taken the country
by storm. For the first time in motion picture
history not a single cancellation was received on
either of the pictures which starred Miss West.

Let us examine a cross—section of the coun-
try. According to a survey made recently, in
Dallas, Texas, “Alexander Hamilton” received
about a hundred bookings, while the risque pic
ture “Ex-Lady" had 230. The Pittsburg ex-
change did not receive a single cancellation on
' “Public Enemy," HI‘m No Angel” or “SO This IS
Africa", but ”Berkely Square" was cancelled by
15 pel‘ cent of the exhibitors and “Voltaire” by 25
per cent. “Cavalcade” was cancelled in the ma~

jority of the small towns in this territory. In the
SL Louis exchange, “Cradle Song," a beautiful
picture starring Dorothea Weick, had 25 cancella—
tions, while Wheeler and Woolsey in “So This Is
Africa," a decidedly offrcolor picture, did a tre-
mendous business.

In the Minneapolis territory, 50 per cent of
the exhibitors asked for cancellation of George
Arliss' outstanding picture “Voltaire." One exe
hibitor did 10 times as much business on “I’m No
Angel" as with either "Voltaire" or “Alexander
Hamilton”. Even staid Boston showed its pre—
ference for the sensationial in the fact that there
were no cancellations for ”Little Caesar,” while
there were 40 cancellations on “Abraham Lin-
coin.”

In spite of such occasional exceptions as
“Little Women" and “Henry the Eighth," exhibi-
tors have learned that the “better element" in the
community cannot be depended on to support
the best pictures Legislation against black
booking will not insure the showing of high grade
pictures, because the average exhibitor is a busi-
ness man and must cater to the taste of the public
or lose his trade.

According to Arthur L. Mayer, a well—known
movie producer, the cinema makers and exhibi-
tors continue to present shabby and salacious pic-
tures to the public, not because of low personal
or trade standards, but because the public has
been completely indifferent to their endeavor to
produce and exhibit valuable humanitarian, in-
structive, and historical pictures.

The only possible solution is to educate the
public taste. This task may take generations
and must be accomplished through the great sys-
tems of public education and religious instruction,
not through more legislation.

Other Opinions

THE COLLEGES ARE STILL 0. K.
(Des Moincs Register)

At Amherst college the other day the bronze rigure
of the goddess Sabrina, over which class "scraps" have
been waged for 70 years. was voluntarily delivered by
the senior class to the college authorities, to. be taken
out of circulation and preserved as a keepsake.

There are numerous other signs that modern college
students are giving up various old, emotional attach—
ments. Fraternities in many schools are dying. and the
class rush is almost a thing of the past. rtegrets are
confined mainly to the grads, who sometimes feel tliat
the old school must be going to pot when sophomores are
willing to let a year pass without cracking freshman
patﬁ.

The New York Times, though, suggests a more pon.
derable reason for regretting the demise of old traditions.
It wonders if the synthetic enthusiasms formerly engem
dered may not have acted as substitutes for the war
spirit, which will now have to find a new and more
dangerous outlet.

But the Times’ theory is vitiated by the fact that
so many modern students are manifesting exactly the
same attitude toward m' itant nationalism as they dis-
play for the old college fetishes.

Not long ago, merely to take one example, Grinnell
college underwent somewhat the same reformation as
now seems to be setting in at Amherst. The annual class
scrap was abandoned some years ago, after it was
thought to have resulted indirectly in the death of one
student and the maiming of another, When the Lusitania
was sunk, Grinnell college sent President Wilson a
pugnacious telegram directing him to “Make a demand
upon Germany" to do this, that and the other thing or
it would be just too bad. Now, in their postwar disil.
lusionment, Grinnell students held an annual conference
on international affairs, the general sense of which is that
war is ghastly and tragic and not unavoidable.

This newspaper does not share at all the Tirnes' con-
cern over the Amherst incident. 1t regards it as merely
another item of proof that the college student today is
learning something besides quadratic equations and
Latin idioms. The boys, in short, are just smarter than
we used to be,

”(H
TIME—WASTE IT? WHY NOT?
(Daily Trojan)

Time!

Poems have been written about it, efficiency expem
have raved and ranted about it, and statisticians have
compiled flgures about it , But there is another
side of the question. Most of the poems, most of the
efficiency experts. and most of the statisticians are heart—
ily in favor of saving time?

How about wasting it?

If all the time that was wasted every day by persons
who could be doing something constructive with that
extra 60 minutes or two ham or Whatever amount of
time it is that they waste were placed end to end, it really
wouldn't make much difference, would it? ‘

Some kind soul has computed that if one spent only
so minutes per day—s hours per week, omitting Sun-
days~thls would amount to 312 hours a year. This
kind soul has figured that if one would only plan to
use “in a profitable way" the hour a day which now
escapes one in the form of odd moments one would, in
10 years, save 3130 hours, not counting—and this is an
interesting comment—Sundays. “This is equivalent,”
he goes on to say, "to 391 days of 3 hours each, or the
number of working days in one year and three months”

it is all very, very interesting, indeed; the only
drawback to it is that if one worked at top speed day in
and day out, utilizing every spare moment of time in
making “definite plans for carrying on the days work"
one would promptly and surely go mad

Nothing is so satisfying, nothing is so constructive
in its effects as wasting a good. hour of time. Instead
of saving up for 10 years and then Laking a years va~
cation with the time one might have been wasting during
that period, a better suggestion would be either to waste
all the time possible during the 10 years and then taking
a vacation anyway, or taking the year’s vocation first
and worrying about the 10 years of hard work afterward

This may be a foolish idea.

But how much easier it soundsl

they heard all about him at Alabama

times that his library was no longer-
a private one. During one lecture,
however, he forgot one of his quipsi
and the class woke up with a bangl

After the class period closed, a
committee of students waited upon
the offender and presented to him a
memorandum which ran somewhat as
follows: “We beg to inform you that
you have committed a grave error in
omitting one of your prize ‘jokes’
from your lecture this hour. The
class considers it a serious slight, and
requests an apology."

Let’s give them a break, and re-

NOTES

Paul Spencer Wood, professor of
English, who was in charge of chapel
talks this week, discussed the meaning
of the various parts of the chapel
service Professor Wood, speaking
Monday on the topic “Whey We Read
Psalms Responsively,” pointed out
that most of us have atmched unmean.
ing words to certain emotions and
that there is always danger of sub.
stituting words for things.

Continuing on the subject to psalms,
Professor Wood explained 'hiesday
the parallelism that exists in the
psalms which must be realized in or-
der to read them understandingly.
”The psalms," be stated, “rarely in-
terpret ‘or generalize, but are full of
Concrete imageryl"

Professor Wood expressed the
opinion, in his discussion Wednesday
on prayers, that responsive reading
and public prayer might be improved
by accelerating the accepted tempo.
He also observed that prayer should
mean more to one than mere jargon,
or the meaningless repit on of words
in concert.

Concluding his series of talks Thurs—
day, Professor Wood presented the
meaning of the doxology which be
defined as a brief expression of praise
to God. it is further, he said, a re—
cognition of the sacredness of the
scripture. and a statement of belief
in the Holy ,Trinity and the one God,
