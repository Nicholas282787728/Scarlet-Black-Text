Grinnell Wrestlers
Victorious at Beloit,
Tankmen Defeated

Grinnell’s wrestlers met and
defeated Belolt 21—13 for their
third consecutive victory. The
Gold were unable to place men
in the 121, 125, and heavyweight
classes respectively, and so Se-
gur, Miller, and Gregg each at
,eumulated five points for the
Pioneers.

The Pioneer swimming team
had a more difficult time. lose
iiig to Beloit 43727. Finishing
first in six out of the eight
events, the Gold seemed unbeatv
able as they broke two pool and
school records,

Battling Carleton all the way,
Grinnell’s indoor tracksters
dropped their season’s opener
59 to 41. -

Grinnell outran the Carls in
the sprints and distance races,
only to fall behind and lose the
meet in the final field events.

Grinnell’s weakness in the
field events can’be attributed to
inadequate operating space and
practice facilities in the base-
ment of the Women's gym, a
condition which forced the Pin-
neers to forfeit in the pole vault
and prevented them from tak—
ing a first or second in the
hurdles. ‘

Coupled with this handicap
was Carleton’s heavily banked
track, whose sharp curves prove
ed too unfamiliar to‘~ our quar-
ter milers and relay team.
