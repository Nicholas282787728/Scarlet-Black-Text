One buffer day
finally enacted

Mental Health Task Force recomnenda-
tion instituted nearly three years later

BY COLIN REYNOLDS

During l~st fall's ﬁnals week, Giinnell students had an extra dav

tinatc—bcfolc their exams.

Administrators cllled this unscheduled day in the academic cal-
endar on blulirlri} offrnrls wcek, a buffer div or reading day lr
was added to the preceding Satulday and Sundav, also labeled as
buffer days in prsr academic cairndrrA

Accordingr to Stephanie Masts, RLC for Cowlcs, Norris and
Dibble Hulls, the Health and Wellness Task Force originally pro
posed rhc bufrer day in fall of2003 in its initial report following its
formation,

The Task Force was made up of students, community mem-
bers, a parent and several individuals from the Student Services and
Mental Health ofﬁces. It also included Vice President for Student

Services Tom Crady, who created the Task Force in response to a
hul week book-ended by two suicides during the spring semester
of 2003.

"What came out or those meetings was a prevailing idea that
students felt very, very stressed," said Masta. “One way to alleviate
that stress, they thought, would be to build in some time between
when classes end and when finals begin After the proposals mtl‘tr
duction, the Curriculum Committee considered the logistical impli-
cations of altering the structure ofﬁnnls week.

It took two years after the Task Force s initial report for a single
buffer day to be instituted.

RLC LeAnne Jones said there was no vocal opposition to an
additional buffer day, but that logistical concerns had gotten in the
way ofimmediatc implementation

“Since each semester’s schedule is planned out years in advance,

it’s not casyjust to cut off
part of the schedule," she
said. Trying to alter the
ﬁnals week with all class
schedules in mind was “a
logistical nightmare,” ac-
cording to Jones,

Masta said the Task
Force rejected another proposal to add the Friday before finals week
as a buffer day because it would have fundamentally changed the
structure of the academic calendar. Cnrdy agreed that it was the pre-
planning or semesters that stalled the proposal. “Right now we‘re
scheduled up through the 2007-2008 academic ycai,”lie said.

Student reaction to thc extra butfcr day varied, ranging from
enthusiastic support to apathy or outright opposition. “From whatl
can see, it just compress-
es the number of exams
rnro four days and makes
you more likely to have
two exams in one day,"
said Aden Stinebricke
ner-Kauffman ’08.

Ted Redo ’07 was
more enthusiastic “I
doubled up on seminars
last semester," he said.
“The buffer day saved
me; I needed the extra time."

Despite the warm reception some students gave the bufrer day,
orhcrs, like Mary Ncsbit’07 felt it didn't go far enough, “I think it's
bullecrap,"said Nesblt. “We have such long breaks at Grinnell. The
college should reduce the length of our breaks and use that extra
time for study before ﬁnals week."

But several students claimed not to have noticed the extra day,
since rhc only testing time slot the college was aetuiilly eliminated
