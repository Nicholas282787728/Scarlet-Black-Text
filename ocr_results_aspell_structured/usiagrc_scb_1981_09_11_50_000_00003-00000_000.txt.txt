This black alumni network will beheaded

Recently, small, private schools such as

recruiting black students and the

has been tough Walker is coniident that

“1! black students are able to talk to so-
meone who went to Grinnell and can see
what we do here, they will be more likely to
come here," stated Walker.

At the conierence, the participants will

'spruce up 'campus
New landscaping program begun

by Tom Lenk ~

it all began when the people in Nollen
House noticed that the campus landscape
needed a little tidying up. There were trees
that needed trimming, paths worn across
the grass, and some patches oi lawn that
just weren't making it. Buildings and
grounds workers could not really take care
of the problem. they still had to attend to
all of their regular duties

Seeing this need, the people in Nollen
House asked biology Professor Ben
Graham it he could put together a crew.
Graham agreed to try and the results aiter
one summer of work include trimmed
trees, sodded lawns, ﬂower gardens, and
lences (That‘s where they came iront!)
that keep people from cutting corners
across some formerly convenient lawns.

Through advertisements in the Campus
Memo last spring, Graham put together a
crew of {our students to work about 10
weeks in the summer. The students, Sarah
Dewey, Sue Peterson, '81: Noah Liberman,
a student at the University Of Michigan,
and Mark Lawrence, who also does not at»
tend Grinnell, were “trained" and initially
put to work trimming trees,

“The need for pruning was obvious," said
Graham. “It's just that it's so time consumr
ing. Apparently B&G doesn’t have time ior

it on a regular basis " He also pointed out
that there was more to trimming than
meets the eye “The thing you have to
worry about when you're trimming is not
Just how the tree will look when you iinish
You also have to consider how the tree is
going to look in the iuture, alter iive or 10
years growth. 1 think that the students did
a very good job in that respect.“

The group then moved on to resodding
some areas at the lawn which had been
worn down by steady traiiic over the years
In order to protect the grass, at least for a
time, a permanent lence was put up in iront
oi Macy House. a temporary one was set up
near the Science Building and “Please use
the sidewalk" signs were placed in omer
various spots. Graham stresed that he
would like students to avoid walking on
resodded areas, at least until the grass has
had a chance to get a good start.

The flower gardens, one by the Fine Arts
Building and one northeast oi the Forum,
were put in toward the end at the summer
program. The gardens were placed,
Graham Said, “where we thought a little
color was needed " There are presently
plans to plant several hundred spring bulbs
so the gardens are ready (or next year.

SGA budget of
over $1 1 1,000 voted

Biggest inerease in concert, movie funds

by Anne Bordonaro

A budget of $111,851.74 was approved last
week by the SGA [or the 1981-82 school
year. This ﬁgure represents an increase of
almost $12,725 over the 1980-81 budget of
$99,225, John Mollet, treasurer of the SGA,
explained that Grinnell students will feel
the benefiLs of this increase immediately in
the form of higher quality entertainment on
campus this year.

The increase in income comes from
several sources including a raise in the ac-
tivities fee. increased enrollment, income
from the electronic games in the Forum
and interest on the surplus from last year's
budget.

Grinnell is one of the lew colleges which
invests its money. Presently, the balance is
placed in a Kemper moneymarket iund
earning about 17 percent intermt annually,
The student auditor writes checks against
this balance,

Last year, response irom student interest
surveys distributed by SGA indicated a
widespread student desire ior mCreast

iunding ior concerts and movies. Hence,
these will be the areas with the biggest
budget increases this year, Some or the
“big name" movies already booked ior this
year include The Elephant Man and coal
Miner's Daughter. in addition, “big name?
concerts such as Luther Allison, Gary Bur-
ton and am Post have also been booked A

the network is the best way to put the black

Improvements made on
campus over summer

Houses sport wooden fire escapes

by Bob Kletne

During the summer, major alterations
were made to ﬁle Grinnell College campus.
Some or these improvements were in
response to federal regulations while the
others were undertaken simply because
they were in need or repair,

on the north athletic field, approximately
$30,000 oi irnprovmenets were made to the
running track,

The weather had also caused some
damage to the Forum, The exposed beams
under the roof of the Forum had soaked up
moisture and were rotting. Fortunately, a
company was able to reiurhish and water
prooi them.

The root of the science building also need-
ed improvement because oi poor architec-
tural design. Apparently the heavy equip-
ment on the science building was placed on
a particularly weak section of the root.
Eventually this led to a breaking oi the root
membrane.

The cost of this construction is estimated at
$50,000.

Many oi the college-owned houses are
sporting new tire saiety equipment. Ex-
ecutive VicerPresident Waldo Walker stated
that last year's lire marshall's report had
ordered improvemean ior many parts oi
the campus Walker slated, “We are in the
process oi complying with the report. We
are installingtthe essential items first and
then continuing with the rest." These new

safety ieatures include smoke alarms, heat
sensors and additional iire escapes.

Some or these lire escapes are con
structed oi wood. Walker stated that these
fire escapes are temporary because the col.
lege plans to sell some or the oii-campus
houses it presently owns when dormitory
renovations are completed. However, the
college has not yet decided which houss it
will keep. When the decision is made these
wooden iire escapes will be replaced by per-
manent iron iixtures

South campus residents were perhaps surr
prised to see expanded parking lacilities on
East Street This action was taken alter the
city or Grinnell established a bike path on
that street

This summer, Grinnell took steps in com.
plying with Federal Public Law 504, which
requires that access to the campus be
available to handicapped individuals
Walker suited. "The Public Law 504 was ac
tually the impetus behind renovating the
pastorate." Several wheelchair ramps
have also been built this summer
throughout the campus Wheelchair ramps
have been constructed in iront oi the
Forum, behind the Health Center and on the

south side of Cleveland Hall
The entire cost [or the creation oi the

.various handicap facilities is estimated al

550 .000
