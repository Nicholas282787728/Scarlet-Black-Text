The Last Acceptable

Form of Discrimination

College ofﬁcials are ﬁnally talking about burying one of the
lastacceptableformsofdiscrirninationidiscrimination against
lesbians and gays

That’s welcome news, because Grinnell is already lagging
far behind on this crucial civil-rights issue.

Last May, San Francisco‘s Board of Supervisors unani-
mously voted to give legal recognition to gay couples. And
Grinnell College lags behind.

In July, New York State’s highestcourt expanded the legal
deﬁnition of a family to include same-sex couples. And still
Grinnell College lags behind.

This summer T.W.A. became the last major airline to end
discrimination against gays by allowing the airline’s frequent-
ﬂier beneﬁts to be transferred between lovers, and not just
between legal family members. And still Grinnell lags behind.

Other colleges ﬂ including Stanford and the University of
California at Irvine i have already taken the lead in recogniz-
ing gay couples. And still Grinnell College lags behind

’ President George Drake says he refused Melanie Cooley’s
request to live off-campus with her lover in part because he
wanted “to maintain the integrity of the residential systemr”
Melanie Cooley now pays full rent on a dorm room that sits
emptyt What kind of integrity has been maintained?

Thomas Crady, Dean of Student Affairs, says that current
policy— which requires that a student have a child in order to
get off campus as an underclassman T does not discriminate

against gay couples: But gay couples can’t make babies, and 7

ﬁnd it impossible to adopt them: How then is present policy
nondiscriminatory?

Drake also says he was afraid to grant Melanie Cooley an
exception to the rule because he would have faced an onslaught
of other couples asking for the same. Is he saying that to have
given lesbian and gay couples the dignity and civil rights that
they deserve would have been too much of a headache?

Universities, airlines and cities across the country, from
California to Maryland to Wisconsin, already recognize gay
partnerships. How big must the pack be before Grinnell aban—
dons its rhetoric about “residential integrity” and its faulty logic
about “non-discriminatory" policies?

How big must the pack be before Grinnell finally gets up the
courage to bury the last acceptable form of discrimination?

Meskins in the Beautiful Land

By Mark Baumann

Idon‘t have a car and I don’t need
one. I have parents. And I know Kim
Upton. l-li, Kim.

This summerl worked with some
chilthen who didn’thave cars,didn't
need them, and yet had them by the
summer‘s endr No doubt they are
caressing the medians of my home-
town as you read this. No doubt they
think they “gets" a pretty good life.

See the 80-pound
cheerleader double
her weight,

encrusted in mud

as she trudges
through another acre.
These are our future
leaders.

These children, aged somewhere
around a decade and a half. are not
criminals. At least not consciously:
they earned their money the old-
fashionedwayAmeywereexploited
at a summer job and asked their
parents to make up the difference.

These children detasselled. a la-
bor ritual peculiar to the Corn Belt,
although it sees other incarnations
elsewhere. They worked hot if not
long hours in the vapid Iowa sun,
making hundreds while their em-
ployers made millions. It is intense
work, lasting only a month or so,
markedbybreakfastsof“P-B»n-l-n-
pop"andlunchesof“P-Brnrirnrpop~

If nothing else. this work builds
character—see the 807pound cheer-
leader double her weight. encrusted

ding. Hear language that would get
you shot in some countries. These
are our future leaders.

retiremenL But I‘m not, and this
summer I faced something more
frightening than the LA. Raiders: a
prejudice so embedded in the minds
of my employers and coworkers it
was hardly noticed.

I worked with migrant workers.
You see, the institution of migrant
labor is so entrenched in exploita-
tion it shouldn‘t have surprised me
that this attitude extended beyond
the work to the workers themselves
I gums it only makes sense to as
sume the worker who allows him or
herself to be so demeaned by work-
ing an absolutely essentialjob should
be seen as less than the dirt he orshe
works, while the boss‘ pick-up truck
serves as a handy umbrella for the
bugs inhabiting the Diner Parking
Lot.Whichisthehigher—payingskill:
the ability to dig a hole or eat a roll?
(Him: the answer involves frosting.)

This should be news to no one.
This is the sort of practice which
made this nation the Neat Place it is
Do you think frozen yogurt could
even exist in acountry where people
worked for a living? And maybe I
should be glad I live in the sort of
place where I can eat frozen yogurt

as often asI please, but I also live in
a country which allows labor prac-
tices that reward the vanity of an
eighth-grader over the necessities of
an indigent farrtily.

Consider this: it is still illegal in
moststatestobum14-year-olds,but
a 40-year-old migrant worker will
bepaid only half the cighlhagrader’s
salary for doing the exactrame work.
Alas, this is legal.

are spending a bundle to prevent the
complete dissolution of your life,
they ean’tswing the entire auto deal.
So you get ajobt You get agoodjoh.
You contract detasseling acres.

Never mind that your feetare flat
and your breath smells. Never mind
that you’ve never worked a day in
your life, that you work up a sweat
just licking an envelope. Because
you are white and young, you can
contract to detassel corn for $150 an
acre.

Now let‘s pretend you‘re another
person, a bit older, 21 bit worse
dressed You're from extreme south—
ern Texas, but everyone calls you a
"Meskin" anyway. You were 14
once, too. That waswhen you pulled
out of school, not because your
complexion was so bad. but because
you needed to travel with your fam-

Or, even worse, where. It’s July
and you‘re between jobs. You hear
about some opportunities up north in

is indeed work, something like what
you‘ve done all your life. Good
honest work For $80 an acre.

Still, you take the job. You have

kind of place is this when a snotty-

make almost twice as much as an

Where the harshest criticism of the
“Meskins” comes from those who
beneﬁt most?

Quoth my boss, who had some
2000 acres being detasselled by
migrant workers: “I tell ya, if 1 was in
