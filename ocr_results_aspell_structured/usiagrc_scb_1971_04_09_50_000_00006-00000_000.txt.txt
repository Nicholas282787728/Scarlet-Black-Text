that such an action is imprac—
tidal.

An innovative part of the
Executive Council plan con-
cerns divisional organization.
Where President Leggett calls
ed for two divisional bodies--
a personnel committee With’
out students andan educational
policies committee with stud-
ents-- the Executive Council
plan recommends that the two
committees be combined, giv-
ing students an official role
in interviewing candidates and
making recommendations to
the Executive Council for the
first time.

Only the faculty members of
the divisional committee
would make tenure and pro-
motion recommendations;
however, students would be
involved in all otherpersonnel
matters at the divisional level.

The Magee plan had several
major concerns which are ig~
nored by the Executive Coun-
cil plan. 018 was a division of
the faculty and administration
by taking away administra-
tors’ votes on the Executive
Council and making it purely
a faculty committee.

Another was to make the
Executive Council and all
standing committees more
responsible to the faculty as a
whole. The Executive Council
plan calls for division chair-
men to report monthly to the
divisions, but makesno provis
sion for any reporting to the
faculty as a whole.

The Magee plan called for a
sharper delineation ofthefac-
ulty's responsibilities in the
college, a problem which is
not approached in the Execus
tive Council proposal.

will indicate that “the college
does not want a whole lot of
transient people."

MacDoweil feels that the 'po-
licy may encourage anatmos-
phere in which the problems
of transients can be cons

‘ trolled, largely by studentpr-
essures, without the restric-
tive security measures re
quired on some campuses.

Some objections have been
made to thepolicy by students,
especially some house presi-
dents. Bill Thomas, former
C of HP President, said that
“a feature of the youth culture
is its openness, and this is
destroyed by decisions that
restrict access to campus."

Thomas and others also be
lieve that the statement, which
was issued by the President's
office to be effective when is
sued, should have gone through
a Committee A committee
concerned with student afs
fairs. They believe that this
decision, and the way it was
issued, is indicative ofa pro-
pensity by the administration
to circumvent proper chan-
nels when student opposition
might hold up or modify the
administration’s proposal.
President Leggett, however,
believes that most students
will welcome the policy, as a
means for dealing with the ins
creasing theft and assaults on
campus.

Actually, the policy repre~
sents no real change from
what had been going on infor-
maily before; Ric MacDoweil
has asked several transients
to leave wmpus when he felt
they were interfering with
students’ normal activities.
The policywili serve the pur-
pose of giving the college a
formal procedure to use when
there are problems or com-
plaints about transients.

The Executive Council plan
also does notdiscuss the issue
of divisional realignment. Cl-
otfelter saidthatthisand other
issues (such as the elimina-
tion of all standing commit-
tees) were sidestepped in
hopes that this plan could be
