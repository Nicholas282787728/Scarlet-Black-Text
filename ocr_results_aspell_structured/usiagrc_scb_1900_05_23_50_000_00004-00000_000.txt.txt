Normal, 10; Grinnell, 7.

The ball teanl met witll another de-
feat, Satlnday, at the hands of the
State Normal team at Cedar Falls.
Clark was hit hard ill tlle ﬁrst few ins
nings, which, together with a few unA
timely errors, accounts for our defeat.

ill the ti t inning, Cninnell drew a
blank, while Cedar Falls scored three
runs on hits by Trotll, Seerly alld
an error by Winsett.

The second inning was a repetition
of the ﬁrst, three hits oft Clark and

errors by Halsey and Sanders netting
three “ms.

The third inning was favorable for
Grinnell. Clark drew a base on balls
and scored on Lindsay‘s hit. Taft
leached ﬁrst on an error and a mo-
ment later, the two runs were scored
on Halsey’s single to left ﬁeld.

Cedar Falls scored one run in their
half on a two-base hit by Vogel and a
long hit to center ﬁeld. Grinnell
scored in the ﬁfth on hits by Lindsay
and Thompson and good base ruli-
ning. Cedar Falls scored two i'lll‘lS in

_ their half on errors by Clark and San-

ders, followed by a hit by Yost.

in the sixth, Fiske and Lindsay each
secured a hit and, aided by stolen bass
es, scored before the side was retired.
Seerly scored for Cedar Falls, after
reaching ﬁrst on Sanders’ , on
hits by Yost, Lewis and Vogel. An
attempt to steal second and a double
from Taft to Fiske, pulled Clarke out
of a very bad hole, retiring the side.

Neither team scored after this ill-

 

ning. although both had men

bases.
