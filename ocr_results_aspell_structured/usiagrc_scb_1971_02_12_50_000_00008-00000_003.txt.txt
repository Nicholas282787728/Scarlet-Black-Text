A CHANT TO GARY COOPER AT HIGH NOON

it is too bad jimmy had one eye

and the hotel owner was sarcastic

for he really liked min

but gold makes men blind

and it was sad to see the young boy

the broad shouldered lad

it was sad to see just sixteen

but the first one volunteered

he came in only

to later leave again

and the sheriff smiled

and remembered the children's cries

as they left the church

but he would have to face him alone

and them

he had never net d. thelig‘paces 9950!?- .

but thatﬁaft e’had s‘een them all

when Rawh ved Lhru wooden slats

and the saloon made not a sound

as he wrote his last will and testimony

he felt closer to her more than ever before

he looked at the envelope but could not seal it

it belonged in the desk drawer unsealed

the window was bright and the planks creaked with dust

the streets were empty and he wept his brow

it was too bad Loyd drank

he might have been here

if his love for that mexloan whore had not blinded

his thoughts about her

but crying wouldn't do

the deputy could always cry later

and he had to kill a man

walking endless he heard the tinkling of the law

as the Rawhide got his girl a toy

that was death for him

the second found it in the barn

where he had lost it as a child

it took only one shot

the last outlaw had no defense '

as she gunned him down from the next window

for his love

and then there was him

he

whose face bore the years of hate

sitting in the prison library

never talking to peter

never listening to mrs. ramirez

so he had to die

and they had to kill him

she

running away from his hold

and he

connecting the machines of powder and steel

and he pulled her up from the ground

and she accepted his embrace

and the town came back

and they left

but the boy would remember the right things.

‘Tis deathtime in the Rockies of jagged rock blades and spiral
syringes sumping in the caves.

Kim folds up and puckers her mouth

for me to climb into,

and she grapples my hand

and we’re smothered, sluthered in each other’s shoulder blades.
Kim cracks a plasticap feeds her» tongue and then invites me too.
It is my soul following the celibate wine down her throat.

(Halloween is alive in the sand raves, tickling the desert-white
thighs of mother earth. BENT, EYELESS thunder'birds with
melted brains and fouled maggot faces ravage the sky,

beating ﬂurring-singed wing tips: burn their black path for

all to see. swell up the venom in us all.)

We came together smoking peace pipes. She became an Alicerin-Wonderland
ﬂoating through tea parties and mock trials. All I could

dream of was the snow in the trees and bushes. And houses which

were made of white candy: virginnl memorial to story book

cottages. The apple pie could be located by smell alone.

(Mustangs on a wild television rampage, dodging furryrdeceiving
cactus. desert- cows circle in the rattling remains of decrepit
toothless joes.)

Kim and me, we held hands crossing Brooklyn bridge. She
laughed at the green fish and yellow plants and frothy suds
in the river.

(Cactus cracks and bleeds the orange-black of a midnight desert
death. Halloween rolls out onto the desert floor)

ORANGE, BLACK TRIMMINGS: what, what? Monsters and peasants and
corrupted overseers and dwarfed Michelangelos, what, what?
Breaktlme for the windows. pains-taking ﬂying with the booze,
and crying — what, what?
(Halloween rolls out onto the desert ﬂoor)
Kim smiled and brought me memories of
past ages when desire was overshadowed by a perfect
contentuthe world was a reassuring thid‘a’thud in finite space.

Kim mouthed words. Her rugged tough- skinned slud and mush

mouth swore silently over all their voices, captured their minds.

(we were all her lovers, her seduced): “insolent knaves. infants

who listen to but few voices. Wherefor art thou mouther,

your sister, your self what you say is but a tower of wierd chemicals?"

Kim. She spake and they heard. She mouthed and they shuddered.
She woke the squirrels in the trees.

"sensuallstsl "

Kim. What insolence dwells in her heart? her vlrgo- virginity
reiterates: "no, no, my God, no. there is no room for your
desires; desires are antiquated. no. no, bygod, no."

The Licking Strainer
(A recognition of the transitoriness)
Into a fever candles snatch time and rebellion
To a crevice-smattered space it falls.
A trace spine line
Cleaning shadows from sun.

Licking Strainer
Melting through you into a waxentzche
Heavy with a slower flame‘s drain,

Hours are dwarfed

By day to night ﬂickering.
Floating rooted

Ashore on the beginning
ﬁlancing belly down

Normalorange
Claws spreading
Deliberately intent

All whiskers I stalk stretching forward.

said.

“Oh, but why?" said I, who
was then called Simon.

"Simon, my friend," they
replied in ctr ordinated uni-
son, which had an air of dist
honest intent content that set
my ease off balance.

“if you marry that one, what
will you spend for money?"

"Go, stop this will you, thus?
It intimidates my anger pov
tentialities," said Simon.
"Have me marry Lunis, rich
I could be, thougha bitch worth
of every cent. No, I refuse to
consent," 1 said, and so did
Simon, all in a very encourag-

"What has she got that she
has not except for money,
Simon?"

"Ha, ha, ha," said me too.
(wickedly). ”You look blind
as you see me. I'm well to
do, and do what I do for fun!"

"Quite, but money, as much
more than you have, which
there is, is worth such a
bother as bitch."

“No, quite wrong. My future
wife, (if I do, afterai1,marry)
and I shall be happy together.
Isn't that true enrietta?"

"Gurgle slurp," she sweetly
replied.

(But that’s only part of her.)
