Assoc. Saturday was most pleasant
to all concerned and the transac
tion or all business brought for
ward was absolutely harmonious.
This spirit is most commendable
and augurs well for a struggle tor
the silver bat next spring, which
while as close and spirited as any
on record, will be conducted in a
spirit of true sportsmanship in
such a way that the very rivalry
between the schools may tend to
unity their interests.

THERE has been a large amount
ot time and study expended upon
the ﬁve competing orations this
year. which ought to insure a tuli
chapel at the contest next Friday
evening. This is one way in
which the whole body of students
can contribute to our success
this year. There is much in the
inspiration of a large audience.
We desire to select the one best
ﬁtted to represent Grinncll at Os-
kaloosa next February. and the
presence of all the students would
not only aid materially in this re
gard, but also attest the interest
ot all in the selection of our repe
resentative at the state contest.
The Y. M. C. A. plan was used
last year and the crowded chapel
as well as the large receipts has
induced the management to adopt
the same plan at admission again.

As usvur. now that the football
season is over. the metropolitan
dailies of a certain class are tlevotr
int: considerable space to editorir

These articles are amusing to one

who has a thorough understand '

ms of these sheets will allow them-
.selves in go in order to curry ia-
vor with the crowd. just so far
are they interesting. But when is
considered the injury done to the
noblest of college sports by such
a mass of misstatements as has
lately appeared in leading news
papers. indignation isaroused. No
account is taken of the mes mahle
amount or good that has been ac
complished through participation
in the game. instead, columns
are devoted to a detailed account
of accidents and injuries however
slight. the vast majority of which
by their own evidence are shown
to have occurred in minor games

- in which the teams participating

have paid little or no attention to
proper training. From such pretnr
ises they conclude that the sport
should be plohibited in the col—
leges and universities of the callus
try, and thereby impetus is givenJ
to the action of certain renowned
legislators. ignorant in the matter
of lootball at least, in their efforts
to make participation in the game
a felony. It is not claimed that
the game is not a rough one. Its
elements of roughness are recog
nized by everyone, but it rs that
same roughness that makes it at
tractive and a game in winch mm
like to participate. It is claimed.
however, and by those who know
that the roughness is not as exteiir
sive as has hecn represented. In
games between teams evenly
matched and properly trained.
participation is not detrimental to
the health oi the players. True.
slight injuries occur, but they are
only temporary anti their effects
seldom last longer than two or
three days. in the big games ot
the year it seldom occurs that a
man is injured permanently and
yet to football as a whole is
ascribed the fatality ot the lesser
games. In a matter of this kind
fairness and impartiality should
certainly be characteristic of our
daily newspapers, and we desire
to protest against its utter absence
in this particular case.
