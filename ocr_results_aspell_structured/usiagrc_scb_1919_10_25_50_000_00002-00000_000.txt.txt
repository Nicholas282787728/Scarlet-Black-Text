Do You Think
There is Much in a Name.

One Hundred Per Cent
Over-subscription Is a
Victory.

You Will Puss the Buck.

It is asked “What's in a name" but
it is a tact that a convict who has an—
swered to a number for many years
appreciates the return or his name.
It‘represents his personality.

So tar as can be discovered the vo-
cabularies of Grinnellians have never
contained a short, snappy- nickname to
designate the school’s rcpresenmtlves.

Iowa claims the Hawlteyes, Nebraska
thc Cornhuslrers, Arne: the Cyclones,
Washington the Pikers while Grimlell
has her "athletes."

After the sports writer has used “the
_ Scarlet and Black warriors” until he
. blushes tor shame he resorts in des»
peraliun to “representatives or Grin~
hell” or the “locals" or "visitors", as
the case may be, and blesses the col—
lege whose athletes are not nameless.

Such an athletic nickname is an as-
set to the school possessing it. It
gives the whole institution a unity
and personality which can he gained
in no other way. '

Through the agency of the Honor G
club a contest will he held to determ-
ine such a name. It should be the
pleasant duty of students, taeulty and
alumni to give the matter their active

The one hundred per cent over-

suhscription of the Grinnell-in-china
budget represents a victory of which

It is proof that Grinnell is bigger

broader national interests.

What does it mean to those who cag-
erly await news of thc result of tho
campaign in china?

It means that they may add new

more of the thousands who eagerly
await the smallest opportunity for edur
cation. It means that thc pitcously
sinitll salaries oi Grinnell men and
women who are (10mg the work may
be increased. it means that more play
grounds may be established for the
neglected children oi overcrowded
Chinese cities.

Above all it means to

The one hundred per cent oversubv

America but it means inﬁnitely more

Community singing is a child or the
war who has come to stay. It has
succeeded because it hits people out
of themselves.
At the Thursday morning chapel
Gi'innell received a taste or commun—
ity singing. With the aid or the or—
chestra and organ the chapel’s attend-
crs put on their own program and en-
ioyed it. Such a service does more
for the uplift of Grinnell than all the
inane chapel speeches ever perpetrat-
ed. May We have more sings.
