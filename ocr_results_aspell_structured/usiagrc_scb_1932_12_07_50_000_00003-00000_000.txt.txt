Cambridge Biochemisl
Assails Darwin Theory

LoS ANGELES, (CNS)7Challeng~
ing certain phases of tha Darwinian
theory, Professor J. B, S. Haldane,
Camb dgc university biologist and
biomcm st, t1 ~ week expressed the
belicf that evolution takes place on.
tirely within the egg cells, rather
than in fully developed plants and
animals.

As a guest of scientists at the
University of California at Lin Angr

egg cells which, he said. have led
him to the conclusion that evolution

result of purely Environmental influr

Experiments in Education
Postponed all Wisconsin

MADISON, Wis, (CNS)7Fllrther
educational experimentation at the
University of Wisconsin this week
was postponed indefinitely as the re-
sult of a decision reached by the
faculty of the college of letters and
science.

Following the abolishment of tb‘c
Experimental college, which con»‘
cluded its five-year program last
June, the faculty members voted in
favor of a comprehensive study-of
all important recent changes in the
organization of the curricula in
American coll-ages and universities,
including methods of teaching and
conditions of student life in the
freshman and sophomore years.

This survey, however, will now be
postponed until the present economic
crisis is over, the faculty announced.
