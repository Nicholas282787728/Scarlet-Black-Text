Sociology Department

reafﬁrms commitment

to multiculturalism
Recent attention to Issues of
multiculturalism at Grinnell College has
prompted the faculty in the Sociology
Department to share our perspectives on
multiculturalism and to share our experts
cnccs in working to decenter our own
curriculum and to diversify our classes.

We want, first and foremost to afe
fin-n our strong commitment to making
multicultural education a reality at this
college. Over the years, we have worked
withourmajors to inlegratcdimensions of
gender, mce, ethnicity, sexual orientation
and class into our course offerings. In the
process, we have assessed not only our
curriculum but also our manner of teach»
ing. Although we believe we have made
substantial progress in reshaping our
courses and pedagogy, we recognize the
need to keep retraining ourselves since
our goal is a genuine u'dnsfonnation of
educational Conlcnlund process The task
isnotsiniplyto adddiffetentpcrspcctivcs,
mix and stir, but to reorient the entire mix
with art egalrmnan focus, This transfor
mation requires diliglence, attentiveness
and ongoing cooperation between stu-
dents and faculty. We have gained enors
mously by the effort as have ourcourscS.
but the process is time-consuming and
intellectually challenging, andtlius neces-
sarily gradual.

This year our department and the
campushavebeneﬁtedfmmtheconuibur
lions of two additional faculty who have
altered courses on the sociology of race
and ethnicity. Camille Zubrinsky taught
a four-credit course on race and ethnicity
as a CSMP Fellow and Lawrence Bobo
taughtaminicourseasaMtnontyScholar
in Residence. We look forwtud to next
ycarwhen MlaTuan \vill offeracoutse on
racial and ethnic identity, also asaCSlvtP
Fellow. Unfortunately. llicSc visiting
scholars only stay foralimrted nine. The
Sociology Department has asked for an
additional faculty member who would
offer courses on race and ethnicin on a
regular basis, but our repeated requests
have not yet been sucoessful.

Webelievethattheresponsibilityfor
cumcular transformation is incumbent
upon us all. We want to convey to the
Grinnell campus that we believe this ef-
fort is not only immensely lnipominl, but
also unimaginably valuable. We chal-

Everyone is responsible for
creating, maintaining
multicultural commturity

At its meeting on March 6, Ihc faculty

speech, of civil rights and of human to
Spect at Gt‘inncll College. lsirongly sup

port the faculty's statement and I suggest
that we each consider the importance of
our own responsibility tn creating and
maintaining a community that values, as
stated in the faculty resolution, “ . all
kinds of diversity, including cultural and
ethnic diversity, which are conducive to
the common good of the community."

For example, our academic departs
ments with the support of the faculty‘s
Executive Council and my ofﬁoe are re-
sponsible for hiring and retaining the best
possible instructors to teach Grinnell stu-
dents. in so doing, we strive for a more
diverse faculty by encouraging candi-
dates from undencprcscnlod groups to
make application for our faculty posi-
tions. We advcruse each position nations

the lines of responsible journalism. We
have no “colon-id” sanitation workers at
Gnnnell. List tiinel checked, we didn't
even have sanitation workers. Hence. the
problem that SPARC wished to address
was that some informationintlieeditorial
was [actually incorrect We were also
troubled that the editorial was ambiguous
about whclhcrornot itwas astaffcditorial
and ifthe entire starfshared [those] views.

Sharpie: alleges that “letters to the
editor and iii cditonals should not be
censored merely because for once the
canipusis actuallytalkinganddebatingan
important issue that affects us all.” It was
nOL and will not be, SPARC’S mission to
censoranyrhingthatisprintedinacarnpus
publication oraired on KDrC, unless we
decmthatitcrosseslegallincs. Ourrolcas
overseeing committee forcampus media
is not one of Big Brother. It is, however,
our duty to ensure that all media are run
responsibly. in the case of the s & B,
responsible joumalrsm entails thorough
factchecking and a degree of editorial
accountability, llhink that theS & B has
donc an admirable job of encouraging
discourse within our community, but I
also maintain diat prompting discussion
should not be an aim in and of itself—
especially when the bounds of libel and
veracity are in danger of being strained.

The worth of a newspaper is not
measured in how much debae it sparks.
mt does not mean that the paper is sud.
denly professional. It merely means that
the paperis servrng its intended purposein
the community 7 to print what people
believe is the Lrull‘i. More imponant to the
worth ofihe paperissomcthing likeaccu»
racy. i will hold fast to the rights of free
speech. but] also believe that free spwch
does not entail letting your sports editor
toss off some fabrication about “colored
sanitation workers."

Iamalsoconcemod aboutthe lackof
coverage of the multicultural debates that
the S & B has been so instrumental in
catalyzing. Apparently, the s & B thinks
that debate, no matter how foreteztching
and universal, is conﬁned to die editorial
