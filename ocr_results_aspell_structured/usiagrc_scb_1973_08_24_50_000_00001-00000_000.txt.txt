gConsolidution Suggested

by John Wylie
”This can be a good, consolidating
kind or year, with some innovations.
A lot can be done if we all talk
together reasonably."
Perhaps Phillip
Kintner, chair-
man of the {acui—
ty, summed up
prospects tor the
coming year best
in these words,
There are many
goals tor the yes
or, but there are
some potentially
serious roadblo-
US.

In separate in-
terviews with K - Pm”? KINTNER

‘ntner and Presls
dent Glenn Leggett and Dean Waldo
Walker, a picture oi a year locused

on timing up college policies in,

some areas and ,improvmg comm»
unicatiuns between elements of the
College community emerged.
Walker mentioned three specilic
issues which need careful considers
ation and evaluation: greater ins
volvemenl or students and laculty
in long range admissions programs,
meeting the need for a more broad-
ly based writing skills program,
and a careiul study of the grading
‘ system and its ramiﬁcations.
Grades have been a perennial is-

sue at Grinnell, with major over- »

hauls oi the system an almostyear»
ly event. Walker noted that it is
time to take a careiul, seasoned
look at the current system in light
ocstudent performance in courses,
sions between laculty and students.
He added, however, that there were
strong dillerences oi opinion on
major issures between each of the
three groups, and that these would
be legitimate and important topics

and the value ol any possible alters
natives to the present system.

A major disadvantage oi the pre
sent system, which allows a stun
dent to drop a course by simply
not completing its requirements,
can allow a student to drop too
many courses, falling below the re-
quired number or credits needed
to remain in good academic stand-
ing. and becoming mired in acas
demic difficulty with little advance
warning.

However, therehavebeen problems
with every grading system devised
and tested thus tar. Leggett comms
ented, “You cannot find a grading
system which will make discrimis
nations among students and at the
same time not hurt anybody’s (eel-
in 5, except A, B, c, D, and E
One of these days both students
and faculty will recognize this."
Leggett and Walker both emphasi-
zed their Willingness to discuss
major issues, including those rais—
ed by the SGA cabinet in their re-
cent letter. ,
However, both showed some reser-
vatlons about the present relation—
ship between SGA and the adminis~
tration. Leggett noted that it is best
to go into serious discussions 'with ‘
good leelings on each side that
something productive will result,
but that some roadblocks to this
leeling have developed. Leggett ex-
pressed the hope that this can be
corrected in the coming year.
Kintner saw Virtually no tension
between the administration and tac-
ultv, and little reason tor any ten-
for discussion.

Kintner urged more experiment-
ing with curriculum, using innovas
tive course structures and new tes
aching methods. In addition. he ex,
pressed strong support tor a learns
ing resource center, which would

and making parts of it work better.

Weil Previews Coming Year

by Brent Schondelmeyer

“We’re stillimpalient torchange,"
Scott Weil, SGA president observ-
ed, “it is the nature or student
government, There isn’t that sense
or immediacy that bothered people
in the spring, however.”

A concern with institutional phil-
osophy is accompanied with 3 plans
and designs on specilic projects.
Among the areas or concern are
SAGA, the Health Center, the Free
University.

“We're always looking for viable
alternatives to SAGA " Acknowledg-
ing that are currently “constraints
of market" Scott stressed the need
for student services in regards
to meals , striving to maintain as
high or quality or lood as possible
within the means available.

The Health Center was singled

out as an important area with a
need tor better services emphas
sized. Well stressed the possibis
lity cl a group medical plan to co»
ver all employees and students of
the college and an “in house" doc-
tor. The SGA also plans to support
Grinnell’s Women's Movement who
in a letter to the administration last
spring cited the incomplete provi»
sions made for women’s health
needs without personal means oi
transportation they stated therewas
no access to a gynecologist.

Plans tor a Free University are
currently underway with tlieopening
oi session to be probably sometime
second semester. Currently in the
process or formulation is a lacuiiy

ures. Verbal scores averaged 614
as last year, and average Math
scores jumped from 608 to 617.

As tuition rose this year, the ave-
rage amount ol the 127 scholarships
