Governor’s Commission
Cont. from p. 2

The initial function of the com—
mission with its 12 committees
will be study and public dis-
cussion. Later recommendations
ior action by governmental and
private agencies will bc lormr
ulated.

interests. Aims

The commission membership
represents a wide range or
interests, as the committee areas
oi study suggest, Other inat-
tcrs will include labor legisla—
tion, resource use, taxation and
industry, and walk that will
involve the commission on rc-
apportionmcnt or the legisla—
tut‘c. . ’

The commission is a large ine
iormetion gathering and coord-
tnating body. It will not be
heavily engagcd in rcscarch,
but will draw upon the know-
lcdgc oi authorities on Iowa
attairs and upon existing re-
search agencies Cooperation on
thc part or research workers
will undoubtedly contribute to
the purposes of the commission.
By these methods thc commlss
sion will have opportunity to
draw upon the best thinking of
representative citizens thi‘ouglls
out the stetc. The immediate
plan ot the commission is to
publish and distribute the pro-
cecdlllgs or the March cons
i'cl'cncc.

Major step For SIate

The Governor's commission
appears to be an important
Stride toward state self-cons
sciousness. Prolcssor L. Hick-
crson of the University of Iowa
expressed the need (or a “com-
mittee of one hundred” some-
how ago in a speech, The idea
was so well receivcd that there
was an overwhelming number
of requests for copies of the
speech and for lliekerson to
speak. Many states and coni-
munities formed commissions
for the purpose of making the
locality more attractive for out»
side industry.

The low commission has a
much more all-encompassing
purpose, although attracting
outside industry is one or the
economic considedrations. The
method of taxation and its
cllect on all the areas or the
commission’s study will play
its role in the work or an
the committees. A Govemor‘s
commission with z.n unlimited
iield oi interest and with
permanent establishment
would seem to be it great axe!
to any slate government.

At any rate. it is pooled in.
terest and knowledge on which
sound legislation and reasonable
adiustmcnt to change may be
based
