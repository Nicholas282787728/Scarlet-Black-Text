Discussion

Each year the process for evaluating faculty salaries
consumes an enormous amount of act. ity tirnc largely
because ofhow time consuming the current process is, the
Executive Committee is discussing changing the process

Under the curienr process, each faculry member writes
an annual report that he or she gives to his or her departe
ment chair. Each department chair reviews those reports,
and their he or she writes a recommendation about the
level of raise each faculty should receive, with support for
his or her rceoning. All 25 departmental chairs then send
all ofrhar paperwork to the Faculty Budget committee.

Tire Faculty Budget committee is composed ofeach

Katherine and Kent
McClelland, members ofthe Cam-

wanted ro extend the fundraising effort to Grinncll. Last

“I often doubt the eifrcacy ofnrarcr-iai aid proiecrs
which send things such as shampoo halfway around

people aspect seems at least as important as the indie

Gallagher, roo. sees more than

current system. First, the process is very time-consuming,
and second, rhe standards for evaluating faculty salary vary
each year according to the varying members ofthc Faculty
Budget Committee. The three criteria used to evaluate
Faculty each year are reaching, scholarship, and service, our
rherc is neither a formula for how much each area should
be weighred nor coucretc guidelines for how to yudge suhe
jective aspects ofeach area

Each member serves on the Faculty Budget Commit»
tee for two years, and generally two of rho four members
change each year. Thus, the criteria for evaluating faculty
salaries can changeannually, “Each year, [the criteria] may
changesignihcantly." said Jim Swain, dean ofrhe college.

Although the concern over more eonsisrcni weighting
exists, it has not been formally discussed, possibly because
of the very reason that members change each year, “like
ccntiy] there has not been a formal discussion on the Fae
ulry Badger Committee about how much weight to put
on each ofthe three criteria and how ro evaluate each of
them," uddcd ivionrgoiriery.

Most of the responsibility in the process rests upon the
departmenteharrs and the Faculty Bridger Committee, and
so some faculty members may not understand how time.
