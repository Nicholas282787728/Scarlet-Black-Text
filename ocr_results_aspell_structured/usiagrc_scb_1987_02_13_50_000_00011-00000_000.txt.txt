S.I. Basketball:

After the appearance of this week's
disappointing Sports Illustrated swimsuit
issue, campus attention quickly turned to
the pounding feet, flying elbows and
sweating brows of the infant ’87 S.l. cage
season. After the first week of competition,
many hidden exogenous variables became
apparent causing fluctuations in the
Veritas Index. The VAX failed to take into
account such intangiblu as the use of
relentless full—court pressure. savage oi-
fensive rebounding and e§ceptional free
throw shooting.

Nowhere were these factors more ap-
parent than in the 5.1. Game of the Week.
an interconference clash between Omar

and the Pharaohs and AIDS. Outsized and .

down by four points late in the game, the
Aggressive Intense Defenders and
Shooters invaded the Pharaohs back-
court with a trapping full—court press. The
infected Pharaohs became plagued with
turnovers as AIDS quickly killed me lead.
On their deathbed, the Pharaohs were
forced to foul, but AIDs’ free-throw
shooting proved too virile and the
Pharaohs were entombed 4145.

The upset of the week occured when the
previously unranked Fother Muckers trip-
ped number four, Liquid Snake Dance
(LSD). LS no D seemed to be grasping at
phantoms as the speedy Fouier Muckers
penetrated their zone for easy scores. The
BOFS, previously unranked and unnamed,

In "Low-Key" Meet

Both the men's and the Women’s indoor
track teams of Grinnell College returned
from “lowrkey” ,meets last weekend to
prepare for the Southern Division meet at
Cornell this weekend.

For the men, this weekend is an oppor-
tunity to gauge their probable competition
for the Midwest Conference meet. in
March, “Conference will probably be a
Souﬂnern [Dlvision] affair, and our meet
this weekend will allow us to have a good
look at Monmouth, Coe and Cnrnell — all
top conference teams,” commented Coach
Will Freeman.

The women’ eam, which is not “up to
strength yet because of injuries," will also
use this weekend’s meet at Cornell as an
opportunity to compete within the division
and to see “where we stand," suggested
Coach Evelvn Freeman.

Commenting on the women’s competi-
tion last weekend at the UNI Invitational,
Coach Evelyn Freeman remarked, “Our
team performed predictably. Some did
well; others used it as a learning ex-
perience." The Women’s team, pitted
against prominent Division I schools,
found the competition “extremely good."

Although'the men had no “winners" in

Sink Cornell

The Women Pioneers were in action
again this past Friday, splashing their way
to a dual meet victory against conference
Cornell. The final score was Grinnell 140
and Cornell 96.

The Pioneers turned in many strong pera
formances, including a new school record,
throughout the meet. Katy Furnish bet-
tered her previous record in the 50
freestyle with a time of 25.47 seconds.
Overall, Grinnell took a total of 9 firsts, 9
seconds, 12 thirds, and an assortment of
fourth and fifths to demonstrate once
again their overall depth and talent.

First place finishes included Colleen
Murphy, 1 meter diving: Heather Lauver,
3 meter diving; Leslie Wilgus, 500 iree;
.Michele Avolio, 200 free and 400 IM; Katy
Furnish, 50 free and 100 butterfly; and
Claire Hutchison. ZDU butterﬂy and 1000

Corrections.

Just a few notes for the sports page this
week: Due to the requests of team
members. neither the men's nor the
women’s swim team will be referred to as
“tankers" any more.

There was an error in last week's S.I.
basketball story. Instead of having “fairly
messy shooters." PMS should have had

the 100 and zoo butterfly, as she bettered
her previous times in both events;
Elizabeth Schwartz, second in both 1- and
ameter diving; Bridget Van Dorn, third in
the 100 and 200 freestyle; Katrina Arndt,
third in the 50 free and 100 breastroke;
Trini Campbell and Lynn Freeman, 59,
cond and third In the 100 and 200
backstroke events, respectively; and
Leslie Wilgus, second in the 100 free.

The team is now gearing up for this
weekend, when they will swim in the State
Small College Meet at Loras College. The
Pioneers will be facing Cornell, Luther,
Loras, Buena Vista, and perennial foe Coe.
Coach Martha Rowedder feels that the
meet will be a good one. with the main
competition coming once again from the
Coe Kohawks. However, says Rowedder,
“The team is looking strong. They’ve had
some time to rest, although they‘re still
working hard in practice." With this added
rest and the team’s depth and talent, Grin-
nell should provide some stiti competition.

feature. We were planning on that anyway,
but it's definite now
