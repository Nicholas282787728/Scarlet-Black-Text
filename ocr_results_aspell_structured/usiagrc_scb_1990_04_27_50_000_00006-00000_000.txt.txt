Women in Politics
Play the Game

continued from page 5

But being accepted has not been
and is still not easy. Women have
had to fight for their rights and for
their political positions by exhibit-
ing a high level ofcompetence and
by playing by the “oldboys‘ niles,"
using ihesystem to theiradvantage
while not alienating the male ma-
jority with which they work. As for
her election campaign successes,
there were other imponant factors
besides her broad base. It included
as she says, making Democrats
proud to be Democrats again.

An additional ingredient in the
1986 campaign was networking,
Through her experience as a nurse,
anursing instructor,showing cattle
at agricultural fairs, and above all,
her political experience she built
up a network of friends and sup-
porters across the state which other
candidates had not considered. and
which helped her so that she just
“walked all over them."

Working in state politics has
been quite an experience for Zim~
merman. As a state representative
and then as lieutenant governor, in
her capacity as president of the
Senate, she has become an able op-
erator who has enjoyed much suc-
cess in gettinglaws on to the statute
book and programs into action. As
an example. she cites events back
in 1986 whcnbills concerning parar
mutual gambling and the lowa
Lottery, and comparable worth (to
ensure equal pay for men and
women injobsofequal value) were
before the legislature. TheCompa—
table Wonh Bill passed the House,
but the men of the Senate commit—
tee,assuming lhatall women would
otherwise vote against the game
bling bill, refused to release their
bill to the floor of the Senate until
the gambling bill was passed But,
playingby thesystcm,Zimmerman
had counted eight women votes in
favor of gambling, and, represent-
ing the women‘s caucus, she in-
formed the Senate Committee that

no woman would

released, whichitwas

half.

while Branslad said that she was
favorable towards it.

Zimmerman hopes that being
elected as a running mate with
gubernatorial candidate Don
Avenson, from whom she ex-
tracted major concessions includ-
ing the chairmanship oftwo major
commissions. will enable her to
deﬁne the lieutenant govemor‘s
position more strongly than Bran-
stad had intended. She would like
to use the change to enable a con-
tinuance of acting as both a
complement and a counterweight
to the governor, while preventing
future governors from retreating
into lofty isolation like Branslad.

COOL!

By Julianne Ehre
and Sasha Vminski

This March, five Grinnell stur
dents: Juiieanne Ehre. Raymundo
Luna, HeatherGlcnn,Cralg Jeffrey
andSashaVnunski, werechosen to
represent the College at the the
national Campus Outreach Oppor~
tunity League (COOL) conference
held in Los Angeles. COOL is an
organization that was started by
recent college graduates with the
goal of uniting volunteers on cam-
puses nationwide, This year the
conference emphasized issues or
diversity in service.

Tile first day of the conference,
all of the students received hands
on experience in an area of their
choice. Each of the ﬁve students
spent the day working on a variety
of topics such as substance abuse,
children and youth, domestic vio-
lence, education, and racism and
discrimination. Vrtunski spent her
day at an elementary school in a
predominately Latino/Latina part
ofLosAngelcsasapartofhcr“lnto

“The thirdrgradcrs I spent some
time with were solneofthegreatcst
kids I’ve ever met Saying gooa
dbyebrotight hugs and kisses item
a group of girls, some of whom I
neverreallygotiotalktoduringmy
time with them."

The following day students and
administrators attended workshops
on issues relating to community
service. Workshops dealt with
differentsoctalandpoliticalissues,
suchasgangsandeducatjonaswell
as organizational and ethical as-
pects of volunteering, including
leadership and defining a group's
mission, Ehre attended a work
shop with Mel King, a protessor
from MIT who discussed the thin

gram thatprovidcs short term asns-

merely lending a helping a hand,
community service can perpetuate
social injustices instead ofcontrib-
uting to long term solutions,

All of the students had rewatdv
ing experiences and have decided
to focus on their own personal areas
of interest. Glenn stated, “My goal
is to use the knowledge I gained at
the conference to improve upon the
performance of the Community
ServiceCcnter.“Now backath'n-
nell, Glenn has decided to work on
issues regarding rape and assault.

Theconfcrcnce’s theme this year
was “Common Ground, Common
Good" and the COOL participants
reiumed with heightened aware-
ness ofdiversityissucs. They stress
the importance of diverse views
and backgrounds in community
serVice as a vehicle for greater
understanding between people.
Also, they feel that greater coop~
oration between the broad range of
campus groups at Grinnell would
bring power to the student body.
