Y. M. C. A. Concerts.

At the request of the coinmitr
tee having charge at the lecture
course, I gladly speak a word in
regard to the two Coticeltcompan‘
ies they have provrrled for the
course, namely: The Max Bcnr
dix Company and the Redpath
Grand Concert Company. It is
an axiom in the concert room and
theatre that an artist who is really
worth hearing once.i worth hcar'r
ing as otten as pa. This is
certainly applicable to Mr. Ben
dix. who heard here with
great pleasure last winter, but
who comes this year supported
by an entirely new company, and,
indeed, a most excellent one. Mr,
Bendix is too great a violinist to
need any comment. He is use
sisted by Miss Elaine De Sellem,
ayoung contralto singer with a
rich. full voice; by Mr. Frederick
Carherry, alyric tenor, who has
sung himseifrnto merited pronr
inence within the last two years;
and by Miss Emily Parsons, pian-
ist.

The Rcdpath Concci-tConipauy
is by far the strongest concert
company tlrat has been ottered
us in many ayear. It would cer-

,tainly be difﬁcult to choose a ﬁner
quartet oivocalists titan Marian
Titus, soprano; Mary Louise
Clary, contralto; E. A. Towne,
tenor; and Carl Dufft, busso, all
or whom have repeatedly sung
with the great orchestras and or'ar
toric societies of this couniry and
Canada. It would be unfair, pose
sibly. to call especial attention to
any one of these, yet it is true [or
the past six yealsoi'so Miss Clary
has been regarded by our best
critics as the ﬁnest contralto that
has been heard in this country
since the days of Anita Louise
Cary, with whom in name she
bears so close a resemblance.
Edward Townc is in the prime of
of his vigor and possesses a clear,
high, ringingvoicc otgreat power.

be one at our leading oratorio

quired his greatest fame. The
compairy consists further of Miss

Sherwood speaks in highest terms
ot praise,

grarn was, “Present Day Rulers."
The private side oi their lives,

ina very interesting way. The

Germany, which was especially
good. A sketch ot Queen Vic-
toria and her tamily tire was giv.

The debate of the evening was
one of the best leatures of the
program. The question was ”Re»

amrmative was \rlppor‘lcd by Mr.
Davis and the negative by Mr.

earnest manner. The judges ap—
pointed by the president gave two
