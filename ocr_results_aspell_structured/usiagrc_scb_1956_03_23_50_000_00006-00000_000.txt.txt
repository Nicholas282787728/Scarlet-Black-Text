been tried out during the past
few weeks has been quite suc-
cessful," President Bowen said,
“Dining rooms will continue to

dining at luncheon. Where
necessary, such use of the din—

The departments of men’s
and women's physical educa—

propriate student groups, have
heen given responsibility to
promote and organize recrea—

trips, winter sports, square-

Noting the recent death of
an lvuT student, Bowen re-

some kinds of prepping." Even.
when prepping is not danger.

less he harmful when it inter-
feres unduly with studies and
sleep.

He asked the students next
year to confine prepping to ac
tivities that are not dangerous or
unduly time—consuming, and
rather to concentrate on edu-
cating freshmen to the tradiv
tions of Grinnell, and on im-
proving the manncrs and esprit
de corps of the halls.
