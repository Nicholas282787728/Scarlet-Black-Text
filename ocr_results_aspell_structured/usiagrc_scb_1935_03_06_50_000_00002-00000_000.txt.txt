'WHOOPI'E ON THE DECLINE

Dr. Walter A. Jessup, former president of the
University of Iowa and at present head of the
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of
Teaching, declared in a recent report that the
“rah-rah" era in the American college world has
come to an end. Asserts Dr. Jessup, the modern
collegian ”is no longer the blase, sophisticated
student of the ‘twenties; he is a hard working, ser-
ious minded person who demands more of the
college library, the laboratory and the instructor
than did his brothers of a decade ago.”

It is interesting to consider Grinnell in the
light of this statement and see if these nation
wide indications of a more serious attitude on the
part of the college student are apparent here at
home. ' ,

“He is hard—working,” says Dr. Jessup, While
he probably. did not referto this matter, it could
be noted that the number of student workers has
reached a new high a Grinnell this year, with
over 40 per cent of the students holding part—time
jobs of some sort or other. of course the’avail-
ability of SRE funds is partially responsible for
this increase, but it is extremely doubtful if stu~
dents would have been so eager a few years back
to obtain jobs similar to those provided by the
SRE. At any rate, many more are helping to
earn their college expenses now than in the past,
thereby revealing a growing desire for learning?

“He is serious minded," the report continues.
The increasing interest in such projects as the
International Relations conference, while it does
not include all of the student body, might be
taken as manifestation of progress in this direc—
tion.

“He demands more of the college library."
It was but recently revealed that the student
demand here for both reserved and stack books
has been increasing steadily in the past six or
eight years; since most of the faculty members
have been here throughout the period, this in-
crease cannot be interpreted as merely the intro~
duction of a new policy on the part of new pro»
fess-31‘s, so increased students interest must have
played a part.

Added indications of trend away from a play-
boy attitude might be seen in the recent action
abolishing all forms of hazing at Grinnell, the
tendency toward disbanding of obsolete or~
ganizations and disregard of purposeless tradi»
tions, and the almost complete absence in the last
few years of ”college scandals“ such as were wont
to enliven campus gossip intermittently in the
gay ’twentles.

Certainly if Grinncll can be taken as a criter»
ion for judging the trend in the college student’s
attitude away from that of the coonskinrcoat age,
Dr. Jessup is very justified in pointing out a grat-
ifying change.

——G—- .
ACADEMIC FREEDO

After much protest from certain members,
the department of superintendents of the National
Education association concluded its annual meet-

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

ing last week with a resolution proclaiming “un-
qualified belief in the principles of academic free-
dom for all workers in education.“ II} so doing,
they belied the fear so frequently expressed by
William Randolph Hearst and his cohorts that
the future of the nation is being endangered by
the tendency of educators away from adherence
to traditional political and economic doctrines.

In facing the need for deliberate study of the
defects as well as the advantages of the existing
political and economic systems, this group has
recognized a much-needed change from the edu-
cational policies of the past. In most of the in~
stitutions of higher learning until the last year
or so, and in many yet today, the study of econom-
ics dwells entirely with old theories which years
of depression have proved inapplicable in our
present distress. Likewise, political theories
which are completely obsolete under existing
conditions are still taught as though they were
100 per cent fool proof. The theories of capit—
alism and the ideals of unmodified democracy
are still foisted upon students, even though their
impracticability in certain phases is all too
obvious.

It is a purpose of education to arouse thought,
excite interest and dispel bias in matters of cur—
rent importance, but it cannot accomplish this
purpose if it must adhere to set principles regard-
less of their riglitness or wrongness. Too many
educators insist upon upholding democracy ”right
or wrong" and capitalism “right or wrong," just
as cver»zealous patriots preach “America, right
or wrong.”

It is only by a community of effort that the
existing economic tangle can be unraveled, and
this demands a well-informed, unprejudiced pub-
lic. The tangle cannot be straightened out by
seizing as a dog would, and shaking it until some~
thing gives, but the matter must be studied care
fully and the loose threads taken one by one and
patiently traced through the muddled mess. To
do this, old and accepted doctrines must be
taken merely as working hypotheses—as starting
points. Impractical elements must be dropped
and adaptable phases of new doctrines introduced
in their places.

The old, familiar theories need not be drop-
ped entirely—n fact it is foolish to try solving a
problem in which all the quantities are unknown
ihut as the group of superintendents recognized
in their proclamation, freedom to discuss and
study new and untried methods must play a big
part in educational institutions of the future if
they are to fulfill their true function.

ARMS RACE 0N AGAIN

Like a bombshell came the recent news dis-
patches irom England announcing the decision
of the British government to enter into a world
wide armament race. With this revelation of
the proposed British plans for larger expenditures
on the army, navy, and air corps, the prospects
of war have grown much brighter, since there is
now no important country which has not embarks
ed upon a policy of heavy armaments. England,
France, United States, Japan, Italy, Germany,
Russia, and others are all beginning to rattle the
sword in the scabbard, and the outlook for the
peace of the world is exceedingly dubious.

One aspect of the recent British notice is
especially important since it is quite incongruous
with other attempts to settle international prob-
lems. This declaraion, couched in unconciliatory
terms, proceeds by only a few days the proposed
trip of Sir John Simon, British foreign secretary,
to Germany for a discussion of international prob-
lems. It seems strange that, if the English really
expected anything to come from this conference,
they would handicap their spokesman with such
a blunt declaration of official policyﬁand so this
action has been interpreted as a sign of the failure
of the conference before it even starts.

Also it is obvious that this recent declaration
of the British can only mean that hope for the
Success of the Franco-British pact for the peace
of Europe is dwindling rapidly. Only a short
while ago offers were made to Germany to permit
her to re-arm and to have a strong air force, but
today all hope of this settlement of the danger
of competitive arms building seems ended and
the world seems faced with the possibility of ans
other furious and costly race.

These latest developments make it plainer
than ever that there is a great and increasing
need for an adequate disarmament program; yet
in spite of this apparent need the politicians who
guide the destinies of the various nations are not
able to provide an adequate solution—in fact they
do only lip service to the ideal of peace. It seems
high time that the people of the world realize that
they are being baldly hoodwinked by their lead-
ers. Promises and fine words will get nowhere.
It is time that real peace proposals be made and
not the kind over which the statesmen covertly
wink at each other or sign with their tongues in
their checks. The people must demand that
something drastic he done- History has proved
that progressive armament programs “to assure
peace" can lead only to war.

The Book Nook

By TED KLEIN

The other day a professor remarked
that to him the most disheartening
thing about the rank and file of col.
lege students was their refusal to do
any more than that exacted of them
in Lhe classroom. He said that he was
constantly suggesting interesting books
to them but chance remarks had lead
him to believe that it was a rare stu.
dent no longer approaches the heavier
works with a feeling akin to self pity.
The books on the rental shelf
sively copy the title of the book in
his notebook. We contended that the
chief reason for this apparent lack of
interest was due to the fact that most
students do not attempt to include even
lighter reading in their daily routine.
Once accustomed to doing a certain
amount of reading each day the stue
dent no longer approaches the heavier
works with a feeling akin to selt.pity.
The books on the rental shell
of the college library will serve to
make the development of the readine
habit a delightful pursuit rather than
an onerous burden.

CAPTAIN CAUTION by Kenneth

of action and suspense, and yet written
with a student's fidelity to historical
truth. It is centered about certain
less welleknown aspects of the War of
1512, and it shows the strife of nations
in the early nineteenth century very
much as it must have been with a good
deal of the gilt off the gingerbread.

escape and from then on it is a battle
between Dan and his enemy, Captain

Mr. Roberts writes with a shrewd
plot sense and a dramatic narrative
style that carries the reader along
without any lag of interest, He is
