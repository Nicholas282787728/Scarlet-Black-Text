British director, Carol Reede.

based his film Our Man of
Havana on Graham Green's book
which is set in pre—Castro Cuba.
The story is a “spy spool” in
which Alec Guinness plays a
political innocent, a vacuum
cleaner salesman who allows
himself to be recruited as a spy
by the British intelligence and
later wishes he hadn’t. Bumbling
espionage efforts and absurdity
abound as “Our Man" (Guinness)
attempts to become a real spy by

» fabicating drawings of secret war
machines based on what he
knows best -- vacuum cleaners.

Master comic. Guinness, is

well-supported by Noel Coward
who plays a British agent and
Ernie Kovacs who plays a
sceptical Cuban police chief.

_ The movie also features
performances by Burl Ives and

subsidy for the arts.

Their fthh record was recently
chosen number one in the nation
by Jazziz magazine. _

In addition to their own
compositions and those
commissioned for them. their
repertoire includes works by
Duke Ellington, Jimmy Hendrix.
Charles Mingus, and Leonard
Bernstein,

The concert is sponsored by
Grinnell College's Performing
Ans Committee.

Think about it. A
voluptuous, tan, blonde in
California is awaiting your
arrival. And most important of
all, she's a “sure thing." This
might not sound exciting to 90
percent of the women on campus,
but 90 percent of the men could
find this a particularly enticing
proposition. This is the
situation that confronts Walter
(“Gib“) Gibson (John Cusack) in
The Sure Thing.

His best buddy from high
school sets up the whole thing,
Gib will travel out west during
Christmas break and fornicate
with the ideal California beach-
babe. It would be the ultimate in
pure physical sexual gratiﬁcation

But there‘s a twist» sharing the
same car ride to California with
Allison. who is traveling to visit
her boyfriend. Allison is a
formal. respectable, bookwonn,
and entirely unappreciative of
Gib's wild and zany demeanor,
In fact, she hates him. But she‘s
an attractive woman, And Gib
likes that.

After experiencing the
adventures and pitfalls of a long.
arduous journey, they come to
like each other, Could it even be
love? But the “sure thing" lurks
around the comer.

The “sure thing" is sexy,
beautiful. capable, and willing
The “sure thing" is tan, friendly.
skillful, and firm And most
important of all, the “sure thing”
is a “sure thing".

Omar Sharif as Dr. Zhivago,
Geraldine Chaplin as his wife,
Julie Christie as his mistress, and
Alec Guinness as his half
brother, the cold-hearted Secret
Police ofﬁcial.

The film tells the story of the
Bolshevik Revolution as seen by
Zhivago, a doctor turned writer
with imperial sympathies. Much
of the film is told in ﬂashbacks
as Guinness interrogates 'Rita
Tushingham (the Girl), who he
believes is the daughter of Sharif
and Christie, in order to find
Sharif, an enemy of the state after
the Revolution.

Dr. Zhivago is quite a
cinematic spectacle (mostly
filmed in Spain and Finland to
look like Russia) and was
amazingly successful when it
first came out. Enjoy!

This is a funny, entertaining
movie. The Sure Thing deals
with sex and love from the
perspective of college students.
Directed by Rob Reiner (This is
Spinal Tap, The Printers Bride,
Sland By Me) with consummate
skill and wit, this movie can’t be
missed.

Outrageous
Women On
the Verge

By Brett Fechheimer

One could forgive Pepa and
Candela if they suddenly found
themselves in the throws of a
nervous breakdown, The two
women. who are best friends, are
victims of a multitude of
outrageous situations and
circumstances-— for example, one
woman‘s boyfriend turns out to
be a terrorist. Pepa and Candela
both inhabit the outrageous and
farcical world of 1988’s Women
Orr the Verge of u Nervous
Breakdown, a Spanish film
directed by Pedro Almodovar.

This movie can be thought of
as a late ‘80's version of Three's
Company. it is driven by the
same sorts of outrageous
coincidences and charming yet
frenetic demeanor which
characterized that popular TV
sitcom, Pepa and Candela are
desperate women who find
themselves in morbid and/or
hellish situations. yet the movie
is hilarious. Farce and deadpan
humor are difficult to accomplish
effectively in cinema. but
Almodovar succeeds brilliantly in
We m e rt .
