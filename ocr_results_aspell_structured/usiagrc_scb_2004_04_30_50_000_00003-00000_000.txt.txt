A personal story:
Laura Riddle-Ford '04

Laura Riddle~Ford '04 began
using the [DO during the fall of
her sophomore year after she
saw it advertised in the campus
memo. The [DO helped her set
up two weeklong externships
shadowing doctors in
Minneapolis over Winter Break.

During her spring semester,
Ford returned to the (DO and
with the help of Langerud, set
up an internship to perform
clinical research in pediatric
ontology at the St. Paul
Children's Hospital in Minnesota.

This past fall, the we helped
her set up a for-credit internship
for the spring semester in
neanatulogy at the University of
Iowa Hospital. Ford currently
travels to the Hospital twice a
week to go on rounds with
doctors and conduct clinical
research.

”I cannot praise them
enough," said Riddle-Ford. "The
[DU ofﬁce has helped me to
make my passion for medicine
into something that I can
practice on a daily basis.”
