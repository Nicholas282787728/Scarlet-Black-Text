HAS DISCOVERIES TO SHOW

Lecturer Returns From Trip Into the
Depths of Saliaros Whore Life
has In Dmigor.

When Count Byron Khuli de Prorok
speaks at Herrick chapel Thursday
night. the Grinnell audience will hear
one of the foremost authorities on
archeology in the world today. His
lecture will give all the fascinating
details of his recent excavations in the
ancient city of Carthage, and other-
dead cities of the Sahara.

The count, who is still in his thir-
ties and has made a name as a lectui»
er in this country, has just returned
from a remarkable automobile expedi-
tion of over 1,000 miles into the
depts of the Sahara desert. A. citra-
van of eighty camels proceeded the
expedition, depositing supplies at var-
ious points. The French government
provided a military escort of 100 men,
armed with machine guns.

Finds Mnnlnliﬁetl Army

The objective point of the expedlr
tion was the Hoggar country, the
home of the fierce Touraegs, who
have fought off every foreign intrud-
er from the time of the Romans down
to the present day. Count de Prorok,
however, entered into treaty relations
with the chiefs, insuring safc conduct,
The route followed by the expedition

. was lined with the skeletons of ad-
venturous travelers who died of thirst
or native treachery. At one place, an
entire Tollmeg army, slain in an an-
cient battle, lies mummified, the bod—
ies having been preserved by the in-

A number of Pullis tombs were
found in which the dead had been ly-
ing, with their i-egalia undisturbed,
for almost three thousand years.
These tombs contained many valuable
relics. Count de Pl'oruk hopes even-
tually to discover a vast amount of
treasure buried in Cai-tbage‘ before its
capture by the Romans. Search is air
so being made for a sunken gallery
believed to contain priceless Greek
statuary, brought from Athens for the
Carthaginian palaces in the days of
the city's highest prosperity.

Explores City Under Sea

During the past season Count de

. prorok, with the aid of the latest sub-
marine appliances, explored the anc-
ient city of Dierlia, now under the
sell; later he opened some of the far
mous golden tombs of mice and obr
tained many priceless relics. The
temple of Tanit was also excavated.

Near the city of Carthage, the exca-
vators also uncovered the tombs of
Hanibdl's family, the stables which
probably housed his elephants over-
2,000 years ago, and Carthaginian are
senal containing slingshots of stone
and lead. Many interesting relics
will be displayed when the Count v-is-
its Grinnell. These include toilet
articles found in the boudoir of a
Carthaginian lady, bracelets of gold
and bronze, ivory hairpins, and pot-
tery of every discription.

The count will give a full account
of his recent discoveries and advenr
turcs, illustrating his sto with a
remarkable series of motion pictures.
Among other distinctions, he has just
been awarded the golden palm by the
French government. He is also a
Fellow of the Royal Geographical Sop
'ciety of Cerat Britain, an olficer of
the Order of Nicbcm Iftigar (Tunis).

HYLAND T0 COACH

AGAIN NEXT FALL

Signing of “Hand iultl lllll Plt‘llsﬂs
Follow‘rs 0f Grillllell Tennis.

Mark Hylaiid, hcad Pioneer foot~
lidll coach for the last two seasons,
has signed a contract to serve in the
same capacity next fall. \Viththis
announcement, prospects for a win
ning team lluve taken on an unusual
rosy hue.

Hylaiid had previously declared his
intention of devoting his entire at~
tentiontohislaw practice at Tania,
but his love of the gridiron game
proved too strong a fascination to be
denied.

With t aiiuouncement also comes
the declaration that Charles Black
will again serve as assistant coach,
devoting special attention to the back-
lield.

During the past two
HylundeBlnclf regime has made a
forceful impression on followers of
the pigskin sport, and the Pioneer
elevens developed under their lute»
lage have made successful records.
The selection of these two ineu to
direct the Scarlet and Black gridiron
destines again next fall meets with
popular approval among fans and
players alike.

College Inquisition

Will Commence

Week’s Run On Monday Morning

The one hundred and sevellty'rse
cntii semiannual Collegiate Inquisi.
tioll is scheduled to start next Mon-
diy morning at eight o‘clock, accord
ing to an announcement made by
John Hanson T. nlain, producer.

Although the bulk of the perform»
ancc will bc presented in the Alumni
Recitation Hall, says the producer,
rooms in Coodnow, Blair and Cliicftr
go balls have been provided to take
care of any over-flow, The event may
last several days, if the demand jus-
tifies, and those in attendance are ex-
pected to come each day. Free board
and room will be provided for all, and
seats are reserved.

Bigger and llcttcr Torturcs

The show this year is reported to
be evcn bigger and better than ever.
Last year's old, Wol'llrnut equipment
has been replacd by brand new stuff
of limitless capacity. The department
of mathematics has received a new
model improved “Pi'esso” thumb
screw, capable of holding seventy—s -
pairs of thumbs at once, the control
board being conveniently situated at
the desk of the instructor.

Students of the laboratory sciences
will not be boiled in oil as in past
years, say official bulletins from these
departments. Research has revealed
that a much more satisfactory tem—

perature can be obtained from a mi -
turc of tin and lead, and the time ele
ment, always an important factor in
scientific inquiry, will be greatly re-
duced.
English Dept. Will Trcpuu

The department of English has
adopted thoroughness as its watchr
word, inasmuch as past experience
has revealed the unreliability of
knowledge expressed by the spoken
and written word, the staff plans to
use the more exact method of trepair
ning. Although this operation is a
highly technical one, it is thought that
there will be no permanent injury, es
pecially to seniors, sophomores and
freshmen.

The departments of ancient lan-
sudge will use the slow but effective
rack. The romance languages will
hang, draw and quarter, instead ol
merely quartering as in the past. The
history department, for tlle sake of
experiment, will ask students to collie
in and out through the keyhole, and
will provide adequate mechanical
equipment to expedlute the process.

Programs, as usual, may be identi—
fied by the customary yellow covers,
and each student is asked to bring a
dime to luncheon tomorrow to par-
tially defray expense. Semester lees
admit at the main gate.

 

SENIORS TO TAKE
SEMESTER EXAMS

Class of 1926 Will Innor-ilc Custom
of Taking Spring Ernmmntimis.

The senior class of 1926 will be the
first one in twenty years which has
not been exempt from the final sem-
ester examinations. This decision is
a result of a Faculty Board meeting
held Monday night.

“The practice of having seniors en—
cuscd from examinations,” Miss Luella
J. Read said, ”IS as worn out tradition.
Under the old plan, every seniortook
part in the Commencement exercises.
He either gave an oration or took part
in the class play. Today, the Com-
meiicemeut crciscs are social
stead of literary and the Dramatic
club puts on the play. The seniors,
then, are no busier than any other
student."

in-

The changes in the curriculm is an-
othcr reason given for the necessity
of senior exams. Years ago, students
were required and were usually four-
years in length. By the end of four
years the Professor knew how the
student stood without the aid of ex-
aminations. Today, however, most
courses are elective, of short duration
and of the lecture type. Especially in
the lecture course, exams are the only
adequate means of grading the stile
dents.

It is rumored that the facility action
was taken because so many seniors
have stated that their not . would be
over as soon as the next sclncstert
starts.

 

Argumentative Trio Eat In Every
Town On Trip To Galesburg, Ill.

Gl'jnuell debaters who journeyed to

Knox last week brought back with
them a perfect record of having eaten
in every town at which they stopped.
Their report or the trip, reminiscent
of Exodus or the Wanderings of
Ulysses, covered inspection of ﬁve
towns and three colleges, and four
days of vacation from classes and reg-
ular meals.

The first evening was spent at dlona
mouth, Illinois. Monmouth college.
a school of about five hundred, which
has a large, new gym and very fine
women's doimitories. The latter,
however, lost their attraction when
it was found that they close at sevens
thirty every night. so the evening had
to 'be spciit on a talk with Professor
Robinson, the acting president a swim
in the new gym, and general v itiug.

Debate Incidental to Food.

Next morning brought a similar
glimpse of Knox College at Galcsburg.
or particular interest were "Old
Main," the building in which the bills
coin-Douglass debate at Galcsburg was
bold, and the men’s dormitories, In
the evening, after the preliminary or
a short discussion with another group
of debaters from Knox College, the
Crinncll team showed their training

 

by searching the town for more food.

Calcsburg itself has a queer feature
in tbe street-cars which run through
the center of the town square. On
these same lines are located what the
debaters dub’bcrl “telepathic switches,"
because they seemed to be controlled
only by thc motor-man‘s wishes, not by
any visible controls.

An unexpected thaw next morning
made the trip by auto to Town City
rather worse than had been anticipdt»
ed. Fortunately none of the party
were addicted to sent-sickness, so they
arrived at Iowa City just in time to
mcet their train on its way out of

time for the inspection of a third col-
lege before the train, which landcd

"Grinllell Can Never Die" Declares Dr.
Steiner ill Chapel Address on
Future 01' College.

”Ci-innell can limel- die," emphat-
ically stated Dr. Edward Steiner in
his chapel tnllc this morning on “The
Future of Crinnells'

Dr. Steiner touched on the rumored
facility changes by saying the men
who are supposedly ﬁlled to resign
do not sorrow for themselves but for
the institution. Hc wcnt ahead to
say that be bad faith in the future of
Crinuell. "I have faith in the future
of Crinncll because Christ is our lead—
er. We put faith in Him so with that
faith we must proceed to study and
support Grinhell with a high heart."

Hus mid Freedom

Grinncll is a spiritual college, said
Dr. Steiner, and she is made not by
her acuvities but by her soul, “Grin—
iiell is an honest college. Many col—
lcges pretend to be but they are not,
at the expense of students who attend
them. In twenty—three years of speak—
ing in exposed places I have never been
instructed in my talks of Criuncll, No
one has ever said to me, ‘stciner you
sfly this, or do not say tllilt'.”

Although he had lived in Gl'innell
for twcuLyrthl‘ee years he had attend
ed but onc football game which was
enough to give him palpitation of the
hcart for the rest of his days, he stat—
cd. He declared that though he did
not fitteltd games he loved the spirit
of athletics. ’

Turns Delnocl'ltt

Dr. Steiner remarked in a humorous
vein that he had boldly declared him—
sclf a democrat and favored paddling
of freshmen He said he had hydro-
phobic every time he saw the prcscnt
generation dancing to jazz music.

“what does Heaven hold for a man
who has children wiio play the stump
phone and the victrola, and who has
a loud speaker-z" He prefaced this
rcniark by saying that a man should
refuse to enter Heaven and have the
everlasting bliss at the expense of
many thousands of others. A mun is
busy during lifc and should prefer to
rest while dcad, intimating that sub—
bhoncs would allow no rest in
Heaven,

The order of the chapel service was
changed this morning, Dr, Steiner
gave his address, then came the prays
er, and the closing number was the
singing of the Grinuell Hymn.

OKLAHOMA U. UNDEFEATED

Strollers Bring Grt t Team on xortb.
cit-n Toni Oklahoma Aggies Also
ll strong Machine.

After a disastrous road trip which
blasted the hopes for a Valley cham-
pionship, the Pioneer cagers have
been hard at work preparing for their
first borne contests Friday and
Saturday with the powerlul Oklaho-
ma university quintet and the Okla-
homa Aggies.

Coach Black has been sending his
proteges through some stiff practice
sessions, attempting to correct some
of the faults that were brought out in
the first three games.

Griiiiicll Team in Bad shape

The Criniiell hoansters returned
home badly bruised. Moran suffered
a brokcn nose and a gashed lip, Niblo
received a bad ankle, Doffing has
several floor burns, and Peterson is
afflicted with a cliarley horse. How-
ever by Friday night all these are
expected to be in tip top condition for
the Sooner battle.

Oklahoma will present a fo'rmidable
team on their northern invasion. The
Sooner-s to date have not lost a game
and have victories over three Colliers
cnce teams, which include Washing-
ton, Drake, and Missouri, all repres-
entative aggregations, Thus far this
season Oklahoma has shown the
strongest offensive power in the con-
ference and basketball critics in the
Valley circles are giving them an
edge in the race for the title. In the
Drake game the Soouel's sent in their
subs in the last of the contest and
thc reserves amazed the crowd by run-
ing up twenty-one points in the last
five minutes of play. The Oklahoma
five has averaged 33 points per game
against their valley opponents.

The Aggies will also bring a classy
quintet up north to battle the Pill-
neers. They walloped Washington
and Drake in two hard fought battles
and lost a close game to Missouri.
Peery, and Connor of football fame
and Elder are the satellites of the
snutherners and are the main cogs in
the powerful scoring machine of the
Aggies.

Although the Pioneers lost their
first three starts they displayed a
good passing attack and a strong dc-
fense and if the Black men get “hot”
this week end they ought to show up
well. Playing on their own floor and
deter-mined to get back in the race
for the Valley pennant the Pioneers
will put forth every effort to chalk
up two victories.
