is how long gone, we congratulate th year’s eye

reformed Student Publicar

After a tumultuous start
at the beginning of this academic yea including
abandoning the old constitution and writing a new
one—SPARC is now fully funcLional, with all posi-
tions filled.

SPARC is putting its budget to work by puts
chasing equipment for the publications room in the
JRC, additional cameras for the eye/one and power
equipment tor KDIC. Functionality is much im-

or outages that plagued the campus radio station all

Falling far short: evaluations get a failing grade

At Grinnell, students and prefer
sors are held to high standards, But
only students are held accountable.

Oul grades are our professors’evail-
uation ofhow much effort we input to
readings, labs, papers, projects or exams,

G t i n -
nell‘s only
method of
gathering student feedback on profCSr
sors is through the course evaluations
given at semester’s end, though this is
an inadequate indicator ofa professor’s
performance, Sometimes, professors
give only five or 10 minutes for stu—
dents to complete the evaluations at
the end ofa regular class. More often, if
students are given adequate time, they
have no incentive to compose a detailed
response because the evaluations come
too late in the semester to benefit stu—
dents currently in the course.

At best, evaluations are submit»
ted for posterity, but even then they
are a weak tool for students to express
(dis)satisfaction with a course or pres
fossor and for professors to survey
student’s ideas because short, written

responses prohibit a dialogue between
parties which would create better unr
derstanding,

The solution to the problem of ac-
counrabiliry and communication is
not to ciiticize professors or students
for poor performance, It is, I think in
part, to change the way Grinnell Col»
lege evaluates professors and classes
by establishing mitlssemester reviews
conducted by disinterested third parties
ill addition to written end-of-semester
reviews.

Reviewing in the middle of the
course means positive changes can be
made which directly beneﬁt the stu-
dents,who in turli have an incentive to
return construcnve evaluations because
they have a personal
interest at stake

so stimulate more
participation and
provide a better
education, which is
the ultimate goal for both reaeher and
student.

Having a third party such as a colt
logo administrator conduct the evalua-
tions in a group setting allows the far

eilirator to ask tnore probing questions
than the current evaluations do and
encourages students to feed off of one
another’s ideas. Some of the best diSr
eussions I've had with my classmates
have been about the course and out
professor. not the readings.

Most importantly, the presence of
a facilitator demonstrates to students
that someone is actually listening to
their concerns, which is miles beyond
the current procedure that leaves stu—
dents wondering what effect their cons
tributions have made, ifany

With an institutionalized coin-
mitment to communication between
students and professors, both become
more accountable to each other, Stun
dents become
more accountable
for their participan
tion because pres
fessors now have
speciﬁc suggestions
for increasing stir

Professors become
accountable to stun
dents through the cndnofnsemcster

er student input was used or ignored.
Ultimately, everyone wins. Isn't it time
that we graded them?
