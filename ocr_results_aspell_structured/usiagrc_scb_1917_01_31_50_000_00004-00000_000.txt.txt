last Friday evening. Those who did‘

played in a most excellent manner.

It is a pleasure to hear one who is
not making a. specialty of concert Work ‘

“Grinnell met Des Moines in basket -

ball last Saturday It; so happened
that the captain of the Des Moines
team is named Salmon, while Swan
leads the Grinnell men. As was to he
expected the Swan team was too much
tor the Salmon tribe. The Salmon ag-
gregation failed to go through the net
once except when given a free chance
at it. The score at the end of forty
minutes was 4073, which might have
been a record for Iowa colleges, had
not Cornell piled up :5 more on High-
