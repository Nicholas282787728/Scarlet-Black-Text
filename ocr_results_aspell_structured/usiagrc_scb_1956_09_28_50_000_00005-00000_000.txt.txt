Don't lose l‘aith in this year's
tootball team yet Coe, despite
graduation and injury losses,
.snll tields eleven mighty rough
men led by a line starred with
:ettcrinen Irom end to end.

Two hundred rorty pound
tackle Bruce Wilkerson told
me. that all the rioneer miss
[likes stemlned iram illcxper
ienee and in this he was back-
ed by his own coach, “Pete"
Peterson and also by the Coo
mentorhWnlly Schwank, who
commented on the game Mon-
day night on Tv.

Bruce was quite optimistic,
"In the films we could see that
we were hitting in our tacks
:ing and blocking,” he said,
"but we iust weren't etrcctive
in what we were doing.“ You‘ve
got to give it to those guys,
they never stopped trying.

One unprecedented part of
"Pete's” strategy is the use of
150 1b., 5’ 7" senior cascaptain
, Dick Thomas in an end slot.

Peterson qualities this simply

by stating that ,Thomas is the

best man he has for the posi-
tion. Tcanimates laud their cape
tain for the fact that he thinks
on his teet and pound ror pound
is a pretty rough customer.
Watch Dick in that line. He may
be hard to see but I think you'll
see the results of where he's
been.
