FIVE

 

Women’s ‘G’
Started in 1911

Miss Andersen Sponsored

Honor Organization

Since its founding in 1911, the his-
tory of Women's Honor G has been
one of evolution in the standards for
admission, the idea of the organiza-
tion, and the standards for admission.

It was organized under the spon~
sorship of Miss Clara Julia Anderson
of the physical education depart-
ment, who is now on leave of ab»
sence, to till the place of an incentive
and reward for outstanding women
athletes. Membership ivas permitted
to those who gained three points by
excelling in hockey, basketball, arch-
ery, tennis and hiking, ‘each sport
giving one point toward the total.

Gave sweaters

Ten years later the practice of
giving sweaters was begun and con-
tinued for five years when the awards
were changed to pins in order to can-
form to the palicy‘of} the National
Women's Athletic association which
prohibited awards of such value.

‘The pins were given for several
years by the Honor C", but they are
now purchased by the members if
desired, emphasis being placed upon
the honor rather than the tangible
reward. The Honor G jackets are pure
chased by members also.

Entertain Girl's

In 1928 the idea that the organiza-
tion should do something beneficial
for the college was fulfilled by the
entertaining of'so girls, representa-
tive of Iowa high schools, at the Col-
onial hall. For the past two years
groups who were representative and
also had specified an interest in a
physical education major were guests
the weekend of the May fete.

During later years of its existence.
an initiatory service for the club was
written.

The organization no longer couclen»
trates on athletic work alone, but
requires a scholastic standard of its
members. The three-point system of
qualification for admission was
changed to the standard point sys-
tem requiring 750 points. Under the
present intramural plan, the emphasis
comes on cottage p'oints rather than
individual.

Eloise Brown is president of thel

organization The other members are
Lydia McDaniel and Janice Vander-
meide.

ciety in 1394, for his achievements in
track and bicycle riding.

Fathers of several present Grinnell
students were prominent among the
early members. S. J. Pooley, father of
John Pooley '34, was admitted in
1892, while Jacob VanderMeide, fa-
uier of Janice VanderMeide '33, and
P. R. Trigg, father of Paul Trigg '35,
and of John Trigg ’36, both became
members in 1895. W. F. Bair, father
of Dave Bair, a graduate student, won
four firsts in the state track meet in
1903.

Sponsors Track Meet

For its part in athletic activities
of the college, the Honor G sponsors
the annual high school track mee
here, and this year it is giving fin-
ancial assistance to the swimming
team. Socially, the club sponsors an
annual dance, and holds three ban-
quets each year, after the football,
basketball, and track seasons. It al-
so lias charge of homecoming celebra.
tions, has charge of the sale of fresh-
man caps, and enforces the no smok-
ing rule o nthe campus. The society
plans t constantly enlarge its scope
of acti es.

Two years ago, the Honor G drewl

up a written constitution for the first
time, making provisions for a formal

‘initiation also. The constitution is the
work of Royce Minier, ’31. Besides
stating definitely the aims and organ
ization of the society, it provides that
men receiving varsity letters shall not
‘automatically become members. but
must first be voted on by the old
members. This year, it was decided
that the president of the Honor G
shall automatically become a member
of the student council.
Present Oﬂicers

Present officers of the club are
Richard Ullrich, president; Myron
Pilbrow, vice president; and Harold
Alexander, secretary—treasurer. Ull-
rich has won two letters each in foot-
ball and basketball, and is a member
of Lantern; Fllbrow has won two let-
ters each in cross country and track,
and this year he is co-cbptain of
track with Alexander, who won a
track letter in his sophomore year.

Six honorary members were taken
into Honor 5 between the halves of
the homecoming game yesterday.
They were: President John S. Nollen,
Louis v. Phelps, treasurer of the col-
lege- John c. Trucsdale director of
athletics; David E Peck, chairman
of the department of music, Charles
‘A. Rawson of Des Moines, a trustee
of the college; and Claude Ritchey of
Villisca, a former football player
here, who was prevented through ill-
ness from winning his varsity letter

The Honor G meets on the first and
third Monday of every month, in the
‘clubroom of the president's hall.

Bears Play
Drake Today

Washington to Fight for

Runner-Up Honors

ST. LOUIS, 1410.7Suffcring the
first serious defeat of the season last
Saturday at the hands of the Creigh—
ton university team, the Washington
university Bears this week have un-
dergone changes in lineup that are
expected to give them sufficient
strength to beat Drake today and
thereby end the conference season
among the leaders of the Missouri
Valley association,

The Bears dropped out of a tie for
first place in the Valley because of
the Creighton defeat, but a victory
against Drake will place them in sec—
ond place in the conference.

Expected Defeat

Although the Bears had made ex-
cellent progress until last week's
game, Coach Jimmy Conzelman had
predicted defeat at the hands of the
Bluejays, a team that outweighed
the Bears by 17 pounds to the man.
The fact that Washington held
Creighton to six points in the first
half indicated defensive strength and

 

fight on the part of the lighter and
less experienced Washington eleven.

Creighton came back strong in the
third period and the Bears, suffering
losses through injuries the first hair,
were unable to hold. The final gun
sounded with the scoreboard showing
to to 0.

May Finish High

After the game Coach conzelman
sai ‘A team like this must expect
to lose a game now and then. Con-
sidering the physical limitations of
this squad, it has done remarkably
well. If we beat Drake we can finish
high in the Valley conference race
and that will be a iiighly satisfactory
record."

Starting the season with even less
material than the usual Washington
Squad, Conzclman to date has brought
the team through five victories, in
which the Bears have scored 113
points. The Bears have lost only two
contests, opponents in these contests
and in the other games‘ played this
season scoring 75 points, which gives
the Bears a margin of 33 points to
the good. 1
Give Drake Edge‘ l

Past records of Washington-Drake
games would give Drake the edge in
today’s game at Des Moines. Drake
has won the last eight games without
Washington even scoring in five of
these contests. But aside from tllese‘
records there are the records of the,
two teams this year. Drake has scored

only 33 points the entire season, as
opposed to 117 for opponents. In ado
dition, Drake has lost three games
in the conference, tied another and
lost two non-conference games.
Coach Conzelman has revamped his
backfield, shifting Cautain Miller from
fullback to halfback, This will pcr-
mit using Miller and tulback Freder-
ickson m the same backfield combin-
ation, which will give greater defen~
Sive strength behind the line. Brick
or, a tackle, has been groomed for an
end position, while Bush, a halfback,
also is slated to get a chance at end,
