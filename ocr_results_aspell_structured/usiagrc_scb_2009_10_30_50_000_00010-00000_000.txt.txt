RevieWing issues of 10/10 and academic calendar

10/10 party‘cannot devolve into chaos again

We realize,that the last thing most students want to do
right now is remember the most embarrassing moments From
ill/lo. However, the gravity and massive amount ofinfractions
this year, as reported in the story on page I, demand that we
continue to discuss ways to improve this campus holiday We
cannot continue to behave the way the we did and expect the
event to carry on as we know it.

Self-goveniance requires accountability and this mm) was
a failure of that. it is supposed to be
a party, not a riot. Ben Finkele
stein ’10, Nathan Levin '10 and
Andrew otto ’10, captains of
the Frisbee team, deserve our
sincerest apologies and gratir
tude for picking up the tab for
our unaccounted for mistakes.
We extend this to those who
have graciously stepped up and ,
taken responsibility for their own mise
takes. Hopefully, more will follow in their footsteps.

There are several ideas being bounced around on how we
can ﬁx 10/10. One of these ideas is that we should limit or
eliminate the visitors that come to campus for the party, but it’s
a suggestion based on the faulty belicrthat Grinnell College
students couldn't be behind the infractions. It's a lazy solution
that doesn’t attack the root of the problem—~IO/10 is an in—
trinsically energetic event and'everyone has to be aware of the
blurry line between riot and party.

_ Along these same lines is the suggestion that sculrity cam»
eras could be installed on campus as a my ofdiscouraging bad
behavior. This is another solution that breaks from the self—
governance ideology, and one that should be avoided at all costs
in order to, maintain the Grinnell community‘s sense of free
dom and responsibility. ' . . - '

There are a few institutional changes that mighthelp 10/10
run more smoothly. The ﬁrsticoncerns the rescue dogs. While

we can all agree they do a commendable job battling sobriety as
well as helping those who do acnrally need reselling, their job
description should be expanded to include ”watch dog" duties
as well. Still, they can’t be everywhere, so it is up to everyone to
say something when events take a destructive turn,

Our next suggestion is that the locations be planned to
avoid a riotous bottleneck This year, Loose Hall was such a
location. In accordance with this idea, a guidebook that would
direct future 10/105 could help to avoid the mistakes made this
year, There is no need to add x-factors to this event by changing

it allnuallyipi‘oper planning can proace
tively reduce the possibility ofbatl
situations.

Finally, something as simple
as it wristband for those who
want to take part in the festivities
could act as a deterrent. Those
without a wristband would still
be able to participate, but weal—
ing one wouldmean that you’re

pledging to keep a lid on the wildest be-
haviors. In addition, not wearing a wristband would mean that
if your behavior were out of line, you would he asked to leave or
retire for the evening.

But these options are just the beginning. Continuing the
conversation on how to improve 10/10 is the best way that
we can ensure that it will continue. However, at the heart of
the matter remains the fact that selfegovernance is key. We all
have to remember to control ourselves and to help guide those
around us in making the right decisions.

A reshuiﬂed academic calendar would beneﬁt us

Grinntll students not only "work hard” and "play hard,” but
we "break hard” as Wellimclming our breaks are often hard
due to assignments, but that a lack of them often causes us to,
well, break down. wed like to applaud SGA for passing a prtr

posal for the reconsideration of the academic calendar with an
eye towards “pace and wellness."

The proposal highlights the significant amount of stress
experienced by Grinnell students even in comparison with stu-
dents at similar institutions, citing mental health surveys that
raise the issues of lack of sleep, feelings of isolation and stress
not only of students, but of faculty as well. The proposal points
to Grinnell’s pacing as a contributing factor to these issues.
While Grimell has the same number of days offas other lnstlr
tiltions, they are allotted differently than most—we have seven
or eight weeks ofuninterrupred class followed by long breaks.
This schedule ofextiemes leaves students with no small pauscs
to catch our breath, so that we end up completely burning our
selves out about four times a year. This absence of coolrdown
time is especially felt during hurls, when the majority ofother
college students have additional reading days.

As an institution with a history of mental health concerns,
it is about time that the administration started taking active
steps to explore ways to alleviate the stress that is one of the
root causes of these issues. According to the American Cole
lcge Health Association's 2007 National college Health As-
sessment, 15.1 percent of Gr-rnnell students reported feeling
“so depressed it was difﬁcult to function"11 or more times in
a yelu—that’s 7.7 percent more than the national average and
7.1 percent more than peer institutions. Smdcnts value Grin—
uell's high standards and academic rigor and would not ask for
changes to be made if we did not actually need them, But Com’
palison with peerinstitutions shows thatthere is no reason that
a challenging and strong education should have to come at the
expense of mental and physical health.

we acknowledge that there may be people who will be re—
sistant to changes in a schedule that has been in place a long
time, as well as the possible concerns raised over the effects
such changes could have on the amount of material covered in
courses. However, when it comes to the health of its students,
the College needs to rise above other institutional factors. Stile
dents do have limits, and we can't afford the consequences of
being pushed past them.

Influenza in die Mensa: livin’ the dream with Swine Flu

When students return from Fall Break
there is always a lot of excitement in the air.
“What did you do?" and “where did you go?"
are popular exchanges for the first 35 hours
before the tedious normalcy of stress and rel
sponsibiliry settles
back in for keeps.
But unfortunately,
not all of us can
attest to having
graciously spent
many a work
hour rebuilding
a sunken city or freeing the planet one justly
picked organically grown vegetable at a time.
Why not? Because some of us may have had
the friggin’ Swine Flu.

There is a whole hullabaloo about symp~
toms and Sign: that mean you, too, may have
the dreaded HlNl that scared the globe some
months back wlth the threat of an imminent
pandemic. But here we are in the thick of
coughing and sneezing, and there isn't much
left of that "28 Days Later” zombie virus kind

of vibe. However, that isn’t to suggest that being
sick doesn’t provide a major buzzkill to one's
plans, especially those vacation plans Whether
it’s getting a head start on that epic seminar
paper or just doing some cheeky autumne
themed outdoor
activity, being
dizzy, coughy and
achy can all be a
serious crimp in
one’s style.

But does being
sick mean that we
have to give up on trying to “live the dream")
Not necessarily, at least not without putting up
a ﬁght. For example, thn else would I have
had the opportunity to spend almost 40 hours
on my ass watching TV and movies with only
a moderate sense of glib? Without the in-
convenient proverbial clamesnatch of a fever
and chills, how else could one justify cycling
through a routine of eating chicken noodle
soup, then watching Star Wars, then taking a
two hour napimultiple times a day?

Granted, intellectuals of the past may have
used colds and congestion as an opportunity
to be inside working out
the metaphysical dilemmas
facing 16th century France.
But in this day and age
or technological comfort,
I don’t think I’m alone in
privileging the life of lore
sure as the ide'al vector for
getting over one’s ailments.
When you’ve got those note
so—run feelings of fsrlure
and fatigue after climbing one ﬂight ofstairs,
maybe you'll know what l'm talking about.

Obviously/,itis problematic for me to try to
publicly justify my own lazy—ass shenanigans
in some sort of editorial confession booth.
“That’s not living the dream, that’s being a
worthless piece of [cxplctive]" one might say,
or “how politically irresponsible!" from anothe
er. But hey, man, look. Some people are \vimps
when it comes to being sick, myselrvvholee
heartedly included. But rather than whine and

sense ofgul/ﬂ

When else would / have had the
opportunity to spend almost 40
hours on my ass watching TV
and may/'95 with only a moderate

pine about what Fall Break should, could or
would have been, why not just rake a minute
to chill, sit back and let an
illness run its course? Gets
ting my Hanes all jumbled
wouldn’t have amounted to
much more than inconves
niencing my friends with
yet another failed attempt
at inappropriately trying
to “will to power." Maybe
rarwatchlng the first and
only season of “Freaks and
Geeks” without showering for frvc days erred
on the side of selfrindulgent, but I’m not so
sure how producnve it is to feel guilty for the
way we spend our timewhen we're “too pooped
to pop." Being sick sucks for most people, and
sometimes you just want to veg. So take your
ibuprofen, pop in a movie and sit the cffout of
this inning, slugger. Once we're back to feeljn’
tip-top, we’ll rock and maybe then we’ll be liv»
ing the dream.
Not satisﬁed? Deal with it.
