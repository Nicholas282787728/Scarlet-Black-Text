Ou Franny occurs the great
event ot the year as regards ath»
letics in the Iowa colleges, This
year there are many reasons why
Grinnell should send a large dclc»
gaiion. We have won the cup
twice in succession and a victory
this year means permanent pose
session. We have a strong team,
as the meet last Saturday showed.
but at Des Moines tlie‘- competi-
tion will be brisk, every event
well contested. The team has
worked hard and faithfully and
should be well seconded by the
students. Other colleges are in-
tending to send large delegations
but we hope the Grinnell contin-
gent will be second to none. at
least in enthusiasm. A cheap
transportation rate has becn ob-
tained which should incieasc the
crowd. in torrner years, the fact
that examination week immedi-
ately followed state ﬁeld day, cf-
lected a lessening ot the attend-
- ance but this time that cause is rc-
moved. The day has been given
as a holiday; let every one use it
as such and let as many as possi»
ble accompany the team to Des
Moines so that it may have good,
enthusiastic support.

Chrestomathian.

Willys Kent opened the pros
gram with a piano solo and kindly
responded to two hearty encores.

Crabb read a ,very interesting
paper, which he handled well in
composition.

Quaitc delivered in a good man—
ner an oration on “The lnnuenee
of the Press.” He handled the
subject rather too broadly.

For extemporaneous work,
Crabb spoke ot “The Action ot
the L. A, W. at the Dual Meet.”

It being a consolidated meeting,
Laybournc and Campbell spoke

New Spring Goods Arriving Daily at: CARD 8.

 

i-cspcetivcly on the subjects, “So
ciety Work in the Spring Tenn
and “The Dual Meet."

The externporaneous debate:
“Resolved, That the theatel on
the whole is harmful," was sup-
ported in the afﬁrmative by Grier,
Marsh and Quaile; the negative,
by Campbell, Laybour-nc and Lin-
coln. The dccisiou was rendered
in favm of the afﬁrmative.

A. Lincoln, cxsgo, was present

' and spoke to thc socictics for three

minutes, cxhol’tin;r them to faith
fuluess and givmg them n little
encouragement.

The Junior Annual.

It was hoped that “On .1 Wash
ern Campus" might be on sale be
fore this. A small shipment was
received yesterday and the bale
ance are cxpcctcd daily.

Orders [l'om alumni and outside
friends are coming in rapidly and
alarge number at copies should
easily be disposed ot. Every slur
dent will want one for his own
library and will ﬁnd it a ﬁt come
panion to other volumes of college
ﬁction published ill the last few
years.

A neat poster by Frank Wing
has been prepared and a ten
copies may be ohtaned at the
bookstores by those desiring them
as souvenirs.
