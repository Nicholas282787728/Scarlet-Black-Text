TRACK ATHLETICS.

The Pmspeets tor a Strong Team Are

Candidates,

Withthe opening of the winter

Little work can be done by base-
ball mcn With our piesent accomr
modations and most of the atten
tion of the trainer is directed to
ward track candidates. Trainer
Watson has already taken the
men in hand and is giving them
light but regular work in the
gymnasium. More new men than
usual are taking up the work and
another encouraging thing is that
old men, who usually are slow to
begin training are thisycaramong
the ﬁrst to begin work. The nlen
are now taking work on the ﬂoor
for lungs and shoulders, besides
taking a regular run on ttie track.
A little later the broad jumpers
will begin work in the east end of
the gymnasium basement and it
is probable that a series of handle
cap jumps, such as have been held
the last two years, will again he
tried.

Almost all of last year's track
team will be in school again this
year, and a number of promising

candidates for the team are now
training, At the fall meet Moir
and Henyon both showed up well
and both will probably make the
’Varsity. Kiesel, who played full
back on the football team, has
won the half and mile in the state
high school meet for two years
and will have no trouble in win-
ning a place on the team. Jaqila,
who ran in the {all meet, also is a
man who may develop into a
strong runner. Boyd, who won
the hundred in the {all meet is
young but may become a fast
man with aycar or two's develr
opment. Among the last year’s
point winners who will try for
for the team again are Captain
Bairin the sprints, hurdles and

middle distances; Rickctts in the

strongest man inthat event.

As usual there is very little
material for the weight events.
Another weak place on the team
is the pole vault, for which there
is no candidate who has done over
ten feet. Altogetherthe prospects
tor a strong team are brighter
than usual and with reasonable
luck Grinnell can make a strong
showing among 1903 track teams.

ELLIS SOCIETY.

When the members of the lit 5
Society returned to Griiinell dur-
ing the month ofSeptember, lgoz,
it was with a new enthusiasm that
they took up society ivoik. The
earnest effort expended by the
committeefor repairing the socie-
ty home was amply repaid by the
hearty appreciation shown by the
girls and by the evidence or a
stronger spirit of co-operation.

During the previous years ot
the life of the society it has been
the custom to follow rather deﬁ-
nite lines of work, the thought be»
ing to preserve in a measure, a
unity ot purpose and a coherence
ct results. This has not always
been attained, a failure largely
due to the fact that a narrow view
or the possibilities oi such a plan
has been taken. The business
committee tor the tall term have
taken a step in the right direction
by presenting a broader outlook,
and by giving a larger varietyanrl
scope to the work. A typical
program which had much of real
interest and lasting value is here
given.

"The Village of London.”

“Parts of London made Attract-
ive by Literary Charm."

"Out-ofrthe-way Corners
Westminster Abbey."

The marked improvement in
presentation of subjects is due to
the training of Miss Smith, who
gave valuable helps and much in
the way of inspiration to original
work last year. The effect of
this training appears especially
in the higher grade oi extempoV
raneous work done. While there
is not as much of this as thele
should be and while it is certainly
true that debates are not popular,
yet the fact, that such work is. on
the whole, well done, when assigns
ed. shows a capability which is
worth developing.

or the special programs given
throughout the year, the Seniors'
programs are the mostpl‘ominent.
On these days farces, tableaux
and musicals are high in favor.
