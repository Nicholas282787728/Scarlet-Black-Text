THE CHAPEL. TALK.

Miss Beulah Logan or Micronesia Tellsl
Some interesting Things Concern-
ing a Faraway People,

Tile chapel was crowded on Friday
morning to hear the talk by Miss
Beulah Logan, a missionary from Mir
cronesic. Miss Logan is an American
College girl liiiving attended school at
Oberlin and is at present on it tour
through Iown bearing the message oi
a needy people. Miss L’lgan is a very
attractive speaker and her charming
manner or presentation captivated
the hem-ts of her audience. Her per
sonal appearance hardly corresponded
With the missionaries of the newspa-
per type but she looked every inch
the charming college girl that. she is.

Miss Logan began by saying that
many peo ple had no idea or the
location of Micronesia. Only recently
the priccrpalcran institution where
she spoke, asked her where she was
from. She replied Micronesia, “Micron
esia”, he repeated, “1 don‘t believe
that 1 know where it is, but than it is
so hard to keep tract of all the small
Downs in the stale.” Miss Logan then
proceeded to state that Micronesia
wasagroup oi islands, about 1,000 in
number, scattered along the squalor
in bilePnc'iic ocean. Her father and
mother were the ﬁrst missionaries to
the Islands and only two week. before
they Ciime, asliipwreckcrcw or twenty
s' lorsl d been put to death. but the
missionaries were received with open
arms by the natives. People were both
ready and anxionsto receive the gils

one ear which Miss Logan measured.
The ears serve as pockets and are re»
ceptacles [Oral] sorts of things. Often
they carry iheir icstamenis in their-
ears. and a new excuse for idleness is
that their ears are so heavy that they
can't work.

The han- oi the natives is long and
curly and on account or the generous
applications or ﬁsh oil is neither pleas

ter the mission schools the hair is cut
and the ornaments are removed from
the ears. They ui-etaught many things
but book learning does not suilice:
they must be shown practical things.
Superstition is the hardest obstacle to
overcome but Christianity is slowly
spreading. At ﬁlsii the chicis feared
the books and would not permit their
use. Warfare has been abolished and
the people have become peaceful.
Children come in great numbers to

the schools and accomcdutioos are
poor. There are only ten missionaries

at present to 35,000 people. More

workers are needed badly and places
