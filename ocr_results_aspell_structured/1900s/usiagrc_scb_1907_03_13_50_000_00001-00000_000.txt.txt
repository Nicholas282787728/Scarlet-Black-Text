DR. STEINER’S TRIP in THE
EASTr . -

During his recent trip in the East,
Dr. Steiner appeared before audiences
in New York, Brooklyn, Boston,
Salem, HIl’tful'd, New Haven, And-
over, Mt. Holyoke, Jamestown, Mout-
clair,and New Britain, delivering In
all twenty-nine lectures and sermons
in nineteen days. He visited and
lectured to classes in a number of the
large institutions in the Eastern
states, and in speaking of his com-
parative observations or the work
done in these and Western scliDnlS,
said the Incl) which most impressed
itself upon him was the lack of earn-
estness and the spirit of democracy
among the universities and colleges
lie visited, and which SO prominently
characterizes the colleges of the West
and Especially Iowa College.

He believes that any class of Iowa.
College could be measured up with
any OILlieﬁe he visited WIDIIOUE any
