@117 the state of the student mind

may be taken as indicative of
the opinions prevailing amongihe
patrons of the collegegand there
is good reason to think that it may
be so taken,7the time is ripe for
an unusual demonstration. in be
halt of the college.during the com»
mencement exercises next June.
Thecollegehassuccesstully passed
through a somewhat critical ex
perience, and is today stronger
than at any other time in its his
tory. The feeling is general that
the college is entering upon a
period ot rapid growth, and that
there is much in store for it during
the coming years. There is good
foundation forthis beliefﬁnd there
can be no doubt that it will be re-
alized it the present golden oppor-
tunity is made use of. The early
appointment ot the taculty com-
mittees,as reported in ourcolumns
last week, is evidence that the
faculty take this view of the situ»
ation. and that so far as they can
bring it about. the inauguration of
the new president and the new
clean will be made the occasion of
agrand torward movement among
the friends of the college. This
will he more or less ot a change
from the policy of the past, but it
is a change the wisdom of which
is abundantly proven by the ex»
periencesototherinstitutions. it
is useless to deny that there is
rather sharp competition among
educational

 

institutions,#a fact.

The part that the students can
have in this great workis no small
one because the patrons of the
college can be reached through
the students better perhaps than
through any other means. The
interest which the different fami-
lies represented here acquire in
the coming events will depend
very largely upon what is said
and done by the students that
represent them. From now until
commencement the folks at home
should be kept thoroughly in-
formed as to the important events
that are to occur. Especially
should the spring vacation he used
to the bestadvantage. The editors
of the home papersshould he told
of the plans as they are made,
and be given a chance to help
spread the good news. By the
m ea ns suggested-——correspond-
ence, personal conversation. and
the use of the home papers—the
people in every community rep~
resented in the college. could be
made to know that Iowa College
is to ﬁll even a larger place in
the future than ever before.
