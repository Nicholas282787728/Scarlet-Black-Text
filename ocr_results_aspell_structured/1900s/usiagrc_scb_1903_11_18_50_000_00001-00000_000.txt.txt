DRAKE WINS FROM GRINNELL.

The Scarlet and Black Team Plays a
Plucky Game but the odds
are too Great,

On Saturday.at the downtown
ball park in Des Moines. six htlli~
dred shivering spectators saw the
heavy warriors or Drake defeat
the light Grinirell team by a score
of 32 to o.

The weather was perfect for the
players and the ﬁeld fast, but on
account of frequent injuries, mains
1y to Drake'smen, and offside
plays, which were penalized, 'the
game dragged front start to ﬁnish.
The game was characterized all
through by the plucky deienseoi
the Grinnell players, and even
after three touchdowns had been
made in the ﬁrst 2o minutes of
play, they did not lose heart but
played the best game oi which
they were capable.

The hundred Griilnell
l'ooters,reeenforcecl by old alumni
and friendsoftheiristitulioii. were
not discouraged but cheered as
lustily at the ﬁnish as at the be-
ginning. it was a victory for
Grinnell spirit and for Jack Wat.
son's training; for while Drake
rised every available substitute.
Grinnell only used one. and that
was hardly necessary to. the team
was playing stronger at the ﬁnish
than they had during any other
part of the game.

For Grinnell Robinson played
a star game, and his long runs on
the fake punt were the spetaculai
features of the day. Robinson
also otiipunted the famous
Stewart. though perhaps the
latter's work rvas not up to its
usual standard. Our center trio.
Handel, Sliipman and Tool, oute
played the Drake men, and all of
them did excellent work in
tackling,

Drake ivas unable to make any
consistent gains'through our line
as Ames did. but rather gained
mostly on short end runs. Both
Walleser and Carlson played their
positions well but their heavy
opponents would brush them away
as though they were only slight
aggravations and rush on with
the little ends clinging to them.

A laughable feature ofthegame
occurred when big Stewart broke
through the line, and seized Rob-
inson by the sweater and set him
back with one hand. for a loss of
about ten feet. The need of can-
vass suits was plainly demon-
strated by that act.

‘ Lyons for Drake broke
through the line frequently, and
tackled Grinnell men for loses,

second half and played the Drake
