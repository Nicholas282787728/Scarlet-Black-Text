411‘ is rarely trlle at Grinnell
that there is any necessity
for complaining ot “knocke s."
But even here we sometimes must
realize that our ranlts are not free
from these members of the anvil
ehorus. When one disapproves
of any policy or person it is much
bellcr- to make a fair open oppos-
ition than to begin work in the
dark with a little hammer, Criti~
cism, favorable or adverse is al-
most always a good thing but
certainly we can get along “1111‘
out thc indi~crinllnate and con-
stant complaint which is made
agninst some of our best men and
measures by the -'ltrroclter,”

zﬁllli lecture by lluniilton \v.
( hltrbie, to be glt'en tit the
Colonial uextl‘uesday evening, is
the most expensive number on the
course, and rn fact Mr. Mabie's
lecture will cost the course com»
mittee more than any lecturer who
has been in Grinnell tor years,
But the tact that Hamilton \V,
Mabie stands among the foremost
literary men of the country made
it advisable to secure him even at
alrcnvy Cost. No one should miss
the lecture. for each owes it to
himself to take advantage of the
opportunity to hear such a man.

BAD WALKS.

By way ot suggestion as to one
of the needs ofthe college grounds
SCARLET AND BLACK wishes to
call attention to the poor condi-
tion of the cinder walks about
the campus. It is difﬁcult—riot
to say hazardous to attempt cross

The Store that Sells Good Clothes

 

 

ing the campus on the boulevard
running straight between Pork
and High streets. The same is
true of an attempt to get from
Chicago Hall to the men's gym-
nasium. These imperfections
have not been so obvious until
the recent warm spell made the
cinder paths over into ditches iull
of mud, through which the safest
method of navigation is by ran or
stilts, Let us hope that some-
thing may be done soon to help
this undesirable condition.
