CALL FOR RADICALISM.

Dr. Bradley Delivers Stirring Address

On Washingion‘s Birvhday.
(Oberlin News)

The address delivered by Dr. Dan F.
Bradley of the Pilgrim church, cleve-
land, on cue morning or Washington‘s
birthday, was perhaps the best or the
kind ever given in Oberlin. The
church was packed and Dr. Brad-
ley was warmly applauded by she and.
ience. which listened closely to his
every word. The singing or the Glee
club \vasadeliglitfull lecture oi the
occasion. Dr. King presided and Dr.
Teoney otrerrd prayer. In part Dr.
Bradley said:

“We happen to be assembled on the
birthday of vieorge Washington, but
so closely have the names oitlie father
or his country and the great Emanci—
pator been linked that you are almost
compelled to tliluk of them together,
They were each the boldest radicals
oi their times. A ﬁery son oi the
south, the incarnation oi war, a tall,
booted and spurred, sunburncd, dare-
devil on horseback—that was George
Washington up to 1753. And even
marriage and prosperity could not
make a conservative out or him.
Washington was nob awaiting gen
eral, bub a ﬁlghting one. He had the
savage speed and vigor oi Napoleon,
Neither in statecrait could Washing-
ton be called conservative. The lirst
prooi or radicalism may be round in
his agency in the fashioning oi the
Union into a single notion. It is even
easier to prove the radicalism oi him
who, when he rel: in Ford‘s [heater in
ism. took his place at the right hand
of Washington. There is no more
