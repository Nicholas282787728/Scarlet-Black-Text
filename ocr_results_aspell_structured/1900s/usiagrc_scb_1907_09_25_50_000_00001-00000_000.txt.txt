iOWA COLLEGE HONORED.

is Admitted to Membership in the Phi
Ecia Kappa Society.

The college authorities have in.
curved oii‘loial notiﬁcation imm the
Secretary oi the National Councilor
the Phi Betaitappa that icwa College
has been granted a charter in this fa-
mous scholarship fraternity making it
one or the 02 colleges and universities
of the country holding a charter. The
only other s.:luol ill'iuu Slii'e holding
this honor is the State University,
which was admitted in 1895.

The credentials oi Iowa College ior
membership were presented over three
years ago, and during this time the
standards or the college and the grade
oi workdonn have been under investi—
gation. Tho matter was acted upon
the Senate oi the Society and also the
National council. The charter was
granted by almost an unanimous vote.
The rounding oi the society in Iowa
college will probably take place next
commencement, and it is probable
that some of the most. prominent men
oi the society will be present at that;
time. A committee 0‘ the iaculty
will be chosen to snlnct some thirty or
the most prominent alumni of the
college as members and irom each
graduating class about one-eighth or
one~ninth will be chosen making about
eight members to be chosen irom the
class oi mos.

The requirements for admission to
the society are ﬁxed by each school
holding a charter to meet its own de-
mands. Formerly thoelassical course
was the only line oi study entitling a
p rson to membership, but with the
developmentloi the sleetivz system,
and the large growth or other courses
of siudy, the requirements have been
broadened, although acortain amount
or Greek and Latin are still necessary.
A high standard oi scholarship, {our
iull years in college, and agood moral
character are the chief midisites ior
admiss‘on. -

The Phi Beta Kappa iraternity was
rounded at William and Mary college
on Deoembanth,1176 Theorganim»
tlnn was at ﬁrst. asscreh body, but at
the time oi the alibi-Masonic agitation
or last century the secrecy and secret
symbols were abandoned. in 1883 the
immunity was reorganized and aelosar
organization farmed, called the Unit»
ed Chapter, which is governed by a
National Council or delegates and a
Senate or twenty members chosen by
the council. A meeting or the coullr
all is held every three years. in each
state the ﬁrst chapter to be eSlubliS‘lI»
ed is called the Alpha Chapter or the
state: the others are called Beta, Gaul»
ma, Delta, etc, according Lo the order
oi formation. The badge of tile-or»
ganization is a gold watch key.
