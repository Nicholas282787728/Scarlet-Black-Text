B. A. C, Meeting.

Tho Board of Alumni Control
was callctl in sessron Dec. lg,
rpoo. by Chairman Semen. and

the trillriiving biisinesstransaclcd: '

The reports ol lhe secretary and
treasurer of the Athletic Union
and oi the football manager were
ailtlltctldndappl'oved. Allotthe
reports were cartfully made out
in matters oi detail and were very
satisfactory. In this respect, to
say the least, the new system is
already bearing fruit.

Plans previously drawn up tor
the improvement of Ward Field,
wore rediscussed, but, as nothing
new was developed, they need
not be repeated, having both dis-
cussed in a former issuc.

The Board drew up and signed
a contract with Mr. J. F. Watson,
whereby he agrees to train the
athletic teams of Iowa College
during the next three years.

The Board seems to concur in
the opinion that brighter pros-
pects lie before the Athletic
Union, both ﬁnancially and ath
letically. A summary of the res
ports is as follows:

My P. ELLIS. Mgr.

The State University is very
temperate in her claims to cham-
pionship honor in tooiball. She
has come to know that a season’s
record speaks tor itself. Minne-
sum and Nebraska should talre a
‘,lessou in modesty. and even Simpr
son should utilize a little ot that
virtuorT/w Drip/tic.
