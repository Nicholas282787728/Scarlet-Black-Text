SOME wow STORIES

All the Leading Schools or the _Stat=
Report Hartt LuckiHome Meet
Will Tell.

The track athletics ol Iowa Col~
lege are now in their second stage
otexisienre. The ﬁrst was the
golden age when at the opening
of spring prominent alumni from
all the various institutions made
forecasts as to the outcome ot the
state meet. It was then that Bill
Brunner. -Doc Harris and others
told how the meet would be won.
Then all was enthusiasm. and joy
reigned supreme. The eagle of
victory soared above the roots of
every institution and prepara-
tions were made tor receiving the
victors

But. alas, a change has taken
place. and we are now in the dark
ages or medizeval period. Iowa
ofﬁcially announces that they will
not do better than win second
place. Ames mourns the toss ot
Coates. and can see no prospects
at all. although they ltave one
hundred candidates in training.
Drake, though discouraged over
the loss of Walters. has not yet
given up hope. but thinlts that
their past reputation will buoy
them up so that they will at least
stand a chance at the ﬁnish. Grim

Boyd and des, but still lives,
although the Des Moines paper
reports them on the ragged edge
of dcspnii‘t

However, before the sun goes
down today this age of doubt and
despair will in part have been
cleared away and the bright day
of the ‘renaissance trill take its
place. All ot the schools are
holding their home mccts today
and their outcome will determine

to a certain extent the condition

dope ﬁend Wlll thrive and prosper

MR. DICKINSON’S ORGAN RECITAL

The organ recital given by Clare
ence Dickinson Wednesday even
ing. April 27 was an artistic suce
cess. It was the best recital in
the Artists" Recitals series. Mr.
Dickinson has aﬁnislicd technique
and a clear conception or all the
works he plays. The Sonata, the
Bach air, Mrt Dickinson’s
Berceuse. the “Bach“ fugue by
Liszt. and Elgar's Military March
were most appreciated. Guil-
mant’s "Prayer and Cradle Song"

his success in securing tliisschole:

was exquisitely done. It is tamile
in to many from Mr. Matlaclt’s
playing of it. The Hollins Over-
ttire was commonplace. and the
Toccata tiy Mereaux. though it is
good writing. is hardly organ
music. it is too trifling. with
the two exceptions the program
was excellent.

GREEN ts COMING.

The Most Eloqucnt of Modern Day om-
iors Witt Lecture on Wed
day Evening.

A short time ago the lecture
cotrrse committee was informed
that Samuel Strauss would be une
able to fulﬁll his engagements
this season. Since the receipt of
the news. the wires have been
kept hot arranging fora substi-
tute. The efforts at the commit-
tee have at last resulted in suc»
cess and they have secured Dr.
Thomas E. Green. the Webster
of the \Vest. as he has been
called. Dr. Green is known far
and wide for his eloquence and
his mastertul presentation of tiis
subject. He was at one time
pastor ot the Grace Episcopal
chuich of Cedar Rapids. and is
well known throughout the count-
ry. The press is unanimous in
singing his praises wherever he
goes. The Boston Advertiser
says:

“At the Lexington Day banquet
of the Sons of Revolution. the
Webster of the west, newly dis—
covered in the east at. least, was
introduced in Dr. Thomas R.
Green. and tor an hourcvery auil~
itor taiily hung upon every word
of the brilliant orator. whose ad-
dress at the close was spoken of
by Dr. Storrs as equal to anything
ever heard of Webster. The
beauty of imagery. purity of die-
tion and grandeur of language in
general held the audience spell
bound. and at the end of his ini-
pressivc peroration they were
fairly aname; every one rose.
wavtng their handherchiats. and
for ﬁve minutes there was wild
cheering."

A STRANGER IN CHAPEL.

One of the most thoroughly en»
joyable chapel talks of the year
was given Friday by the Reverend
G. W. Moore. of Nashville Tens
nesee. who is traveling ﬁeld agent
for the American Missionary so-
ciety. with supervision over all
the institutions of learning for
colored people which are con»
trolled by the organization. Mr.
Moore's address was an eloquent
plea for universal education. but
