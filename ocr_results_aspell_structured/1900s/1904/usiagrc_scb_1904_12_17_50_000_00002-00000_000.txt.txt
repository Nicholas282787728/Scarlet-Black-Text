ASIT SEEMS IN THE DISTANCE.
To THE Ebl'roito‘ or SCARLET AND
Boron:

I have read ertracts from News
Letter, relating to the football season
lust closed, published in the issue 01
SCARLET rsxi) BLACK [01' the mi
of this iuollih.

The general ricw isas l'ollows: There
has been lltcl: 0i success on the part or
the football team during the post
season and failure on the part of the
coaches and trainers: the‘ldilure, it
is alleged, is due to lrmk oi athletic
material, and lackoi ﬁnancial support

In explanation it is suggested that
tllcrelris been a slight falling oi: in
the enrollment Ofmen in the college
during the past few years and an in-
ci-ease in the enrollment of women;
that Grinncil can no longer hope to
draw [rain the ranks or high scllool
athletes as it did in lormer years.

Then, apparently as a remedy, it is
suggested, that [line lor clldltyc has
come, and that Iowa College should
stand [0! obsoluteprii-i'iy in all branches
of athletics; that in making up new
schedules the management should
arrange a larger number of games with
institutions in about the same class as
Grinnell.

It seemstome that tile slight, lall-
ingoliill the number or men attend
ilig the college does not afiol-d a satis
factory explanation as to any consider-
able tailing oli‘ in the ability at the
athletic teams; neither is there any
satisiactory reason assigned wiry Grin-
nell should not continue to draw a
fair share of athletes from the second-
ary schools of Iowa.

Now as to tile “purity" proposition;
the writer of the former article statcs
that it is time for a change; that ab
solute pllriLy is demanded. Does the
writer wish us to inler that there has
been a. low standard prevalent during
the past year and that lack or success
is due to that; or does he wish us to
understand that they were impure and
successful in winning games in the
'90s and now, that we are [lltl’B and un-
successful? We should be clear in our
diagnosis belurc we attempt a remedy.

Liberal ﬁnancial support on the part

of the gellerltl public and the alumni
