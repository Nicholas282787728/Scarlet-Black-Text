Cxpt'cixcs wrtlt feeling the
satisfaction at the students of Chi-
eago University over the recent
action of the authorities-in extend
ing the hour limit for class dances
to three a. ni. whereas it had for-
merly been set at one. The
.lll'tvvlm tlocs not state however
whether- those happy students of
the Midway School had at heart
the best intcreets oftlre Univei ’ty
as a scitt of learning or asa society
center nhen they give vent to
their jay over this extension of

social privileges.
@NE of the strongest
centives to sincere effort in
Elie ﬁeld of Athletics at Iowa Col-
lege is the hope that lies in the
breast ot every man that trains of
some day becoming entitled to
the honor G. Such istlte respect
that every athlete has for the
emblem provided by the Union as
a reward for valuable service in
intercollegiate competition. It is
evident also that if the emblem is
to serve as an inspiration to better
work on the track. gridiron, dia-
motld and courts of tennis and
basket ball it must preserve its
distinctive primary signiﬁcance
and the records of the Union show
that that body origimrlly planned
to guard the MaltcscCross and the
letter 6 with a jealous eye. At
the present day it scents that the
originators of the accepted design
made a big inistalse when they
neglected to secure a copyright
for the United States and Canada.
The G is worn indiscriminately on

the uniticnal admiration for the
design and the utter disrespect for

The few autl lame excuses for

fact thatit is annl’lg. more nor

design which no one. least at all a
