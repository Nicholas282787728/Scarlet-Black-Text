ESERVING or more than passing
mention is the recent vrsit or

the governor of our great commode
wealth, Stripping the man 01' allhis
political signilicance. there still
stands out his malicious intliritluality
with its compelling strength and “he
questioned purity. Governor Quln~
mills isa liielong eVp’menb or the Grill-
nell spirit at its best. Forced to the
front by sheer talent and monliness,
he has come unaided to be admittedly
one or the leaders or the pre rrt gener-
ation, both legal on-l political. But
while his success comhlzlll’ls our re-
spect, his ideals captivate us. In
point or purity and courage, his record
puts that at our present Grinnell
eleven to shame, and who could say
more. To be thoroughly tricd a man
must taste or deicat—our late visitor
has no deﬁciencies in this respect, his
political history being one long series
or contests with iorces intrenclred be-
hind the ramparts or organization and
political machinery, and tlrcreiore de-
ieats were ineritable. To come \ln»
smircherl irom such soiling inﬂuences,

his most bitter-opponentsrsa proud recs
ord ior any man and our governor has
stood the test, Such aman will be
always welcome to the halls or our in-

stitution.

with this fall a complete rel-elation

solving to sacriﬁce all to the attain-
ment oi absolute puriti- in poi-sorrel
and consistence in the training of the
Squad. Owing to the scarcity oi ma—
terial this departure has proven
necessarily more or less or a suic‘ ial
policy, but to the dispassioned observ-
or there can belittle doubt as to its
wholesome eliect in the inture.

Campaign enthusiasm is low not
only in our western colleges, but in
the larger unire ,ities as well. Cili-
cago reports that numerous clubs have
bceuionned but no action has been
taken, A year ago a lnouk convention
[or the republican nominal/ion [or
governor was held at the university
and this created groan enthusiasm in
it political way. A series of debates on
the various sides of the question which
is now foremost in our public ﬁeld has
been proposed. Surelysomething or
this sort should be done, especially if
there is any probability or either side
discovering debatable ground. Snell
men would be of value to the denier
crdlic campaign managers.
