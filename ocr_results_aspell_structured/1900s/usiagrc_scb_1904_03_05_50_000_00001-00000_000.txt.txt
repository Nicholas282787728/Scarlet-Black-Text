pose of the Athletic Union to
maintain the honor G in its right-
lltl signiﬁcance,

WHEREAS, indiscriminate use
of the G, the emblem of the Ath-

viduals has in the mind of the
Athletic Union resulted in the

lctic Union of Iowa College con-
sider the use of the emblem (a
black G on a scarlet maltese cross)
or any imitation of the same, by
classes, organizations, or individu
als not duly authorized, is an act
unfriendly and antagonistic to
the Athletic Union and unworthy
of any loyal student of Iowa Col-
loge.

ers of the city of Grinnell be re-
quested to sell G pins
