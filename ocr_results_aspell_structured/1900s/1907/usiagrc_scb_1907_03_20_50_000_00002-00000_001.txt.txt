the Ames team. A. A. Burger.

Mr.
Burger was astrong and iorciblespeak-
er although his delivery was some-
what halting. He enumerated the
evils of private ownership and opera
tied and offered public ownership as
the only remedy for capitalization
with all its attendant evils.

H. B, Quarton introduced the nega-
tiveior Grinmell and gave probably
the most iinished and best delivered
speech of the evening. He dwelt on the
great work of private initiative and
offered elIecLive regulation as the best
solution or the problemr

The second speaker for the atnrnna
tlve was E. s. Haskell who gave a
logical presentation or the advantages
of public ownership based on the old
plan that it was 1st. sound in principle
and 2nd, that it. had been successful
to practice. In supporting this second
point he dwelt especially on European
conditions.

W. H. McClenon was the second
speaker for Grinuell and he demon-
strated his debating ability by entire-
ly dlscardlng his prepared speech and
devoting his time to refutation of the
previous speechr He demanded a, proof
for over capitalization and pointed
out the dirferences between conditlons
.l'n Europe and the United States.

The lastspeaker for Ames was L.
C. Schauiz He presented an eneciive
and uniﬁed speech claiming that
private ownership had been the great-
est scurce of corruption in our cities.
that it would always remain so and
ﬁnally thatmunicipalownershipclIers
the only possible remedy.0. w. Boardv
man closed the mail] debate and de-
voted most of his time to a very elIec-
tive refutation of the alﬁrmanive’s
arguments. claiming especially that
public ownership leads to the greater
evils of fostering political machines,
allowing contract gralts. and won‘t] re.

, The rebuttal work was very good.
