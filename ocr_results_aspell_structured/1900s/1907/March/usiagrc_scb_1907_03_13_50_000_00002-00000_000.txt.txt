BLACK, that there seems to reruarn
but very litLle to say in an article or
this kind. The history of the Societyl
has been olbeu given, and is well
known, and the rurureoi an organiza—
tion even more than an individual is
ior the most part an unpr-ohrnb‘le sub-
]ECt of discussion.

There areaiew pornrs, about the
aims and policy of the Society, howev-
er, which may have been forgotten by
its members and not known by its
iriends, and consequently or some inn
Latest.

Ellis society has ﬁrst. the funda-
mental aim of all literary societies—
to supplement the culurral value or
college work by practice in easy public
speaking as Well as study of topics of
general valueIand interest. This idea
is carried out in Ellis throuEh the mar
JDl‘ity of programs planned Ior the
year, in Which not only strictly litera~
ry, but so rar as may be, scientiﬁc and
artistic subjects are considered.

There are many other ends to be
sought and gained, however, by join-
ing a literary soclety, and while Ellis
does not claim to achieve these more
iully than many others, she does try
to keep them clearly in view.

One of these secondary though in:-
portant aims is to develop the woman-
liness of her members. We need not
admit what many believe thdta ch-
loge education decreases a woman's in-
terest in purely womanly things. but
We do realize Lhat in the rush of col-
lege life but little room is left for the
cultivation of the more gracious and
feminine side of the college girls na.
ture, In the society then, we aim to
devotelnncllol our energy to lilting
the members for some or the many
phases or her life airer graduation.
Most women now-days belong to clubs,
or as professional or business women
are called upon for executive ability
and clear-licarlctluesS. The value of
society work for this trainingY is easily
seen,

Again, many women are woeiully
rleilcicnt in tlie ability to work with
each other. The many questions of

rricuds who are closely associated
with them in society work: whose
aim is their own, to uphold the ideals

work done or she highest possible
order or excellence. They learn to be

sires in the common desire; to prefer
others to themselves They learn ro
accept frank and honest criticism in
