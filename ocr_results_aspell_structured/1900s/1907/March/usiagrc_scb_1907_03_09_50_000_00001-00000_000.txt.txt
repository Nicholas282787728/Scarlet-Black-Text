Track and Bziseballiseason On.

A Few Words Concerning the Prospects
and Schedule.7’rrnclr Outlook is
the Better.

As usual at this time OI the year the
athlete is anxiously awaiting the
opening or the truck season when ire
can get out and loosen up on thecinder
path. The past few days hare shown
signs or approaching spring and al-
ready a few have ventured outside the
training shed. If the weather con-
tinues to improve. training will doubt
less begin in earnest in a iew clays.

Of course at this time or the year it
is impossible to say anything concern
ing the individual men as there has
been no Chance to get a line on them
as yet. Iiowerer a iew general re-
marks about the schedule and pro-
spects for the coming season will not
be out of place
