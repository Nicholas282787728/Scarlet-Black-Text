LITTLEEIELD'S LECTQRE.

Interesling Facts About die Senate and
House.

The lecture given at the Congrega-
tionalchiirch Wednesday evening by
Congressman Littieheld oi Maine had
inany unique and pleasing features.
Mi. Littieiield's subject “Education
and Ciri mtiou” does not carry its
theme on the race oi it but was clever-
ly and logically made to apply to the
condition oi the negroes in America
today, their rights and destiny. The
impossibility oi remedying the evils oi
existing conditions under our present
laws was illustrated by a discussion oi
saine oi the peculiar and not generally
understood methods oi the United
States House and Senate which prov.
ed to be the most interesting part oi
the lecture, and ill'Jvckeil a wish that
more ofli‘ua speaire s tiine had been
deroted to this branch oi his subiect
and loss to introluctiao anl gener-
aliattion.
