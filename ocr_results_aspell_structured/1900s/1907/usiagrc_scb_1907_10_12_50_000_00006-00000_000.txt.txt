VARSITY vs NEBRASKA.

have been putting up an excellent
iiiTicle or ball while Marshalltown
can always be depended upon re: a
good team.

All'enooumgiug feature this year is
bhe {not than there have been three
teams out:pr~acticing all season and
the schedule which has been arranged
for the Reserves is by no means an
undeserved reward. Negotiations are
now m] for a game with the Drake
second team as a. curtain raiser {or the
DrakeGriuuell game which are likely
to be successful.

Although rrhe lineup today will
probably be changed frequently to
give every man - who has been
outracliance, the team will start the
game as follows: 0, Long; rg, Orvis: lg,
Miller: rt, Eran lt. Hull; are, Beers;
in, Hammond- hr,Sliinstrom:lhb, Gill;
zb. Hosmer: Ib, Porter.

With two games today. followers of
football will have Lileir hands full and
from now on the inceresb will be at a
White hearth

MASS MEETING.
Though the masslnaebing 'l'llursday

evening,' was nob as well attended as in
should have been, some tmD hundred
or more Sbudents gathered on Ward
Field at about live o’clock to show
their enthusiasm for the team. Slaglln
(mil Met'l. led in some enbliusiastic
yelling and considerable spirit was
aroused.

At about 5.47» the teams lined up
for a scrimmage. The men played
with snap and Vim, and certainly
show improvements in the manner
in which they get into the game. The
second team played hard and at one
time came very near scoring the Var-
sity. A good second team is almost. a
necessity in developing a good iirst
team and a rellow that consistently
practices on the second team, though
unable to make nhe ﬁrst team, is cer-
tainly to be commended.

day at his home in Des iloines.
