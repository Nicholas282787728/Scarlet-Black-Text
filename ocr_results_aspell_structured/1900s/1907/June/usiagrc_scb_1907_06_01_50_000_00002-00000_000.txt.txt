AND BLACK

Waterloo TimesTnbune—Tiie slu-
deots at lowa College, at Gi-inneii,
are entitled to considerable praise
for the very neat edition or their
college paper, “Scarlet and Black," in
which the report of the university ex-
arcises is leatnred. Brother McBride
has covered the exercises well. con»
sideriug the limited amount or space
which he hadr While of course the
Founders’ Day exercises are the prin-
cipal feature or the edition, the other
news at the campus was by no means
forgotten The amount of advertising
carried shows that the people oi Grin-
hell are doing all they can to make
the college journal the success which
it deserves to be.

Some or the best newspaper men in
the business today got their iirst ex-
perience with printer's ink while
managing college publications.
