During the past two years the re-
oitcls given by School of Music gradu-
ates have not been accorded as large
audiences as are justly due them, both
because ofrheir own intrinsic merit
rind because of their representative
character. There is no reasonable exe
cuse [or this condition or auairs, The
recitaishnve always been of a high
order of merit, and this year’s pro-
grams will he no exception to the rule
As an opportunity for real musical
enjoyment they should appeal to
everyone. They should appeal to
something deeper than that in the
hearts oi the Senior Class of Iowa Col-
lege, and or School at Music under
graduates—to the loyalty of class
mates and to the enthusiasm of a
common interest, The dares of the
recitals are givenin the Calendar. Let.
us give them rousing audiences Ior old

[or the players to look back upon with

productions or it in Chicago last
month,

The story of the play concerns a
kindly and philosophic old batcllelor
who tries the experiment of taking a,
girl from a foundiing hospital to edu-
cate according tolris own ideas, and
with the intention or making her his
wife at some future time, but as the
poet Burns has loretoid, the “best
laid schemes ofmice and men gangait

rails in love with a young soldier. her
guardians nephew, an d there is
notillng left for the Old miiii Lu do but
