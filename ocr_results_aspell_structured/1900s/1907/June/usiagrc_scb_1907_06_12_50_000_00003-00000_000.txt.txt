CLASS DAY EXERCISES.

The class day exercises which were
held Tuesday in Herrick Chapel and
on the campus were perhaps the most
beautiful of the whole week’s enter-
tainmants,

The exercise were begun at 10 o‘clock
in the morning before 8. crowd which
completely tilled the chapel. During
a piano duet by Grace iianson and
Ethel Granger the Seniors took the
seats reserved for them at the front
of the house. E. J.. Jaqua, president
Of the class, acted as Chairman. After
an invocation by Prof. L. F. Parker.
William Cochran delivered the class
oration on the theme "Service." Mr.

Cochran spoke oi the things which'

must be put away forever with the
close of college life and of what college
life had meant, the shattering of be-
lieis and the knowledge gained to-
ward the great secret of life i. e knoW~
ing oneseli. The call to the present
class is to help make the world better
and happier. This does not mean
wholesale reform but the adlustlng of
the present forces to the ultimate
happiness or man. in closing he em-
phasized the joy in receiving the
diploma, with which was mixed a
certain amount of sorrow at the at-
taming of the desired end, but with
conﬁdence in the class and in each
other the Seniors are ready to set out
on the sea of lire. Mt Cochran’s ora-
tion was exceptionally well composed
and delivered and Was perhaps one of
the best orations of the whole Com-
mencement season.

After this Ralph Lyman, ever popu-
lar beiore a Grinnell audience, sang
Clays ”Gipsy John" in a very eiructive
manner and was compelled to respond
to an encore. Ruth Babbitt then read
the class poemfcliristo Dune.” , She
ﬁrst told of King;Arthur’s Knights of
old and their famous motto camper»
ing them to the founders of Iowa Col-

 

lege and thelrideals. These are the
sort of men who are needed in the
world today and the sort that the
present Seniors laspire to be. Tile
college has taught the lesson, her part
is done anrl that of the Seniors has
yust begun.

Maude Alexanderin her usually
pleasinginanuer delighted the nudi-
once with “‘Vllen the Heart is
Young" by Dudley Buck, aiter which
Jean Gnltdelivered the mantle Ora-
tion presenting the ancient mantle to
the class of 1! She spoke of the
task of making names in the world
which faces the class and the two de-
mands which are felt—tor preparar
tlou and service. Opportunity is a
mockery to the unprepared. 1907
must go torth and is willing to irans-
fer the right to do all things in 001’
lege. Richard Nuckolls then received
it {or the Juniors promising to cherish
the mantle and What it symbolizes
and to advance the work left to do in
college. The Cardinal (luartette
then appeared for the last time and
were heard at their Very best in Sulli-
Van’s “The Last Chord," The ap-
piause which they received testiﬁed
to their popularity. After the bones
diction by Prof. Charles Noble. the
Seniors duringa duet played by Grace
Hanson and Ethel Granger, passed
out or the chapel.

After the ceremonies in the chapel,
the class planted the historic ivy
which with the aid of the contribu-
tiousfrom'ruture classes is expected
to cover the east Wall of Herrick
Chapel. Katherine Lane delivered a
very pretty ivy oration.

In the afternoon favored by ideal
weather [or the ﬁrst time during the
week, the class exercises on the cam-
pus were held at 2 o‘clock. The class
day procession marched from the Li-
brary to the scarlet and white stand
which had been arranged on the lower
campus An exceptionally large class

Iday crowd was present and listened to

a very well prepared program.

Arthur McBride ﬁrst gave the class
history uslng a home made “school
atlas" forilis material. He spoke at
the many triumphs and disappoint
ments or 1907, then the opinions or
othersconcerning them, and numer-
ous otherrearuresin a clever, witty
manner illustrating them With maps.

Helen Clark then, in a clever rill.
disposed ofallthe various attributes
oisenlordom and no one feature was

omitted, the will containing some
twelve clauses and willing away even
the traditional senior privileges. A
new Ieature was introduced When
Morse Rew advised the faculty of
different mistakes ill the management
of the college which have come to the
notice ol the seniors,

Ile was iollowed by Susan Hartmanl
who delivered the class gitts and no
one was neglected in the many “pack-
ages” which were delhered. Ruth
Reed then departed from the tradi-
tional foolishness of a. class prophecy
and in a prettylittle poem told of a
dream which she had had concerning
the l'uture or ’07. Cora Bryson, chair-
man or the class day committee, pre-
sided during the afternoon.

Taken as a Whole the 1907 class day
exercises were the best for many
years in the opinion or ”old Grads"
who know and. together With the
class play in the evening, will long he
remembered in Iowa College.

SENIOR PLAYSCORES A TRmMPH

“Mice and Men" is Given by
Greeied by a Packed House.

rgo7.

There have been many plays put on
the stage by students of Iowa College
in the past, but never has any play
ever met with greater appreciation,
,nor received more uninvited praise
than the comedy presented at the
Colonial last Tuesday evening by the
class or 1901. “Mice and Men" is the
titleoi the production. The audience
was litrsze and was in an appreciative
state or mind and the work of the

caste received round aiter round of
applause. The hestamateur play ever

staged is the unanimous opinion of
all who heard it.

The stage settings were all very
simple and yet were very pretty. The
third act, the scene at the Masquerade
Ball, deserves especial commendation.

The plot at the play is quite simple,
Mark Elnhury. a philosopher, has his
own idea concerning the education of
children. He conceives the idea of
adopting an Orphan girl and then ed-
ucating her for his Wife, and with
this purpose in mind, he adopts “Little
Britain" renaming her “Peggy”.
Captain, Lowell. Embury's nephew,
hasiallen under his uncle’s displeasure
because of his \vild Ways, and is con-
sequently sent abroad. Belcre going.
,ile accidentally meets Peggy and rails
in love with her Joanna Goodlake.
IWife of Rover Goodlake, a friend of

 

 

Embury’s, has a secret love aliair
with Captain Lowell. This love is
not returned by the captain, upon his
return home in two years, Joanna.
Goodlake persuades Peggy that the
Captain is in love with another. Peggy
resolves to go secretly to a Masquerade .
Ball in order to see this supposed
lover OI Captain Lowell‘s. There she
sees Joanna Goodlake meet the Caps
tain. rloger Goodlake andﬁmbury
come seeking Joanna Goodlitke and
accusing Captain Lowell of carrying
her from home. Peggy takes all the
blame, explains the presence 0i all at
the hall and renouncing Captain
Lowell, promisesher hand tojirubury.
But Embury has strength of character
enought to bid her marry Captain
Lowell her lover and her real choice

The play abounds in delightiul situ-
ations and clever wit. Tire success of
the play can be laid to no one charac-
ter, but rather to the excellence of
all. Mary Jailuith as Page? played
her part With exceptional ability
While Arthur McBride as Embur)’ dea
serves no less praise. Ernest Jaqua
as captain Lowell was very commend
able, Clayton Haas in the part of
Roger Goodlake played very consist-
ently and was quite clever, Mary
Wiley as Joanna Goodlake had an es-
pecially nlllicult and thankless part,
which she played with her usual
ability. Alithe other characters in
the play desene special commenda-
tion The mass scenes were all
handled with exceptional skill, es-
pecially in the scene at the tall. Proi,
Ryan who trained the caste, exceeded
allhis past eﬁorts in his great suc
cess with this play. To him belongs
allthe credit [or the excellent pro-
duction of last evening. The Work of
the caste throughout showed 'the
marks of his training.
