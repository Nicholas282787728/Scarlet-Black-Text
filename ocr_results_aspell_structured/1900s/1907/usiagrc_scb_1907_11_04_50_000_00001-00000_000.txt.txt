The game Was it unique one in .ch
oral w Grinneil scored ten points
in the ﬁrst hall without oucc making
ilrsr dawn. while in the second hali
the Scarlet and niackrplayed Drake
to a standstill but was unable to score.
Drake hegan the game with a steady
march to Griiillell’s goal smashing the
line and working the tort rd pass ef~
icctivcly until within ten yards oi the
line a pass {your Denny went directly
into the arms oi Bair who ran 95
yards l'or a touch dowir. nlearnaster
kicked a succssinl goal.’ This proved
the turning point or the game ior arter
this the Drake team lacked the energy
and ginger shown early in the contest.
Later in the hali Bleirmaster made
a pretty place kick on an angle irom
the . yard llrrc tints scoring the ten
points made Grrnnell. Toward the
end oi the nan Drake again mayed
slicessluliy some at the smashing ior-
lllztliolls which were used early in thc
contest. In the second hali Drake
played without spirit and only made
ﬁrst down twice. Grinnell kept the
hall in Drake'sterritorr and Hair tirade
several gains on end runs while Tur-
uei- smashed the line ior co tent
advances,

Probably the nrost prominent mature

second half succeeded in twice down-
