“WE ARE NEGLECTING DEBATE.”
[Coiiiioled iroin supolcineiil}

debate in eight words. give abouh one

Stoops 120mm and almosta column
and anal: in announcing the coming
gynmasium_lneet. .

1 am glad that the SCARLET AND
BLACK expresses regret over our pres-
enL condltlun and I am sure it can do
much to improve this condition. You
say that we are in a bad way, and that
there is no'lieln [or it. I admit that
we are inabad way, but iirnoly be»
lleve than we can gee out of it: ”We
can, it we will," 0. 11.1mm.

Space iorbids making all the conn-
lnents which are suggested by the
aborc. “We oau,iiwe will". is un-
(lollbtedlynrne. bub we "will uot"as
long as ehe inlerest in a debate must
come hour the debate itseli as we
now have it. This inch is yet to be
disproved Mr. Horn's discussion is
adequate [row a debating stangipoinc
but be h ’5 rolled to show how achonge
of sentiment is to be brought about.
In regard to the SCARLET .«xo BLACK
giving undue space to other things
chan debates. we can only say that
previous announcements of coining
events are furnished by those inter-
ested in them. the columns oI the
paper being gladly opened to such due
nouncements. Ab the time in question

 

all the space asked for was given to
each, which goes to prove that the ad—
vertising managers 01 activities large-

ly determines the amount of inheresh
shown therein.
