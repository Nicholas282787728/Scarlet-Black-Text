ACADEMY COURSE IS REVISED

A Four Year's Course is Now Ollcmd
in ihc Preparatory Deporimeiu

During the summer Principal [loin
has revised ald enlarged the course
in the Academy till it now requires
rour iull years to complete it. Tire
causes for the change are two, in the
ﬁrst place it was desired to increase
the present thoroughness or the work
done in the Academy. .lnd in the
second place, it was desired to increase
the rating 01 the school under the
rules of the Carnegie Fund for retired
Professors. These rules rate a school
by the number or rccitotious given:
thus many less thorough schools re-
ceived ahigiier rating than Grinueli
Academy because. they gave a four
years' course. The revised course no
viates this diniculty.

Under the new course, a larger
amount OI time is Spent in Blatnem at-
ics. Latin. History and English, The
courses in Shorthand, Steuography.
Bookkeeping, etc, are still retained.
It is still possible ior_anystudent, who
has the ability and the desire to do so.
to complete the course in three years
by taking an extra number or hours of
Work Theliew course is more [hora
ough than the old, and G r i n n ell
Academy will continue to do a higher
standard of work than ever before.
There is no iligll School which can
