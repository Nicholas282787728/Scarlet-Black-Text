Through a mistake which could not
be controlled by the present manages
meet many regular subscribers have
been left on tl-e subscription list. We
are now trying to make amends for
this and are today beginning a iriail
ing list to all histyeai-s mail subscrib-
ers. 1i you do not want the paper the
managementwill conierita iavor ii
you so sigriiiy, otherwise the paper
will be continued. -

With the beginning oi another
school year the probleiii oi outside
activities comes into discussion again.
From‘ editorials in other college
paperslrelative to this matter oi the
proper adjustment of school work and
outside activities, we should judge
that it is as vital a problem in every
school as‘in Iowa College. The old
conditions oi study ior six days with
literary society on Saturday evening
being the only diverting iactor oi the
week has passed away and today we
have many forms of‘ athletics, musi-
cal organizations and other kinds ci
inter-collegiate contests, The. in-
ﬂuence oi a studenbs’ outside interests
is vital in his college course ior
thxough these are formed many of
theirieodships and the ties .oi in.
terest which makes him loyal to his
Alma Mater and iurnishes many oi
the happiest recollections or his col.
lege days.

This isaquestion which each stu-
dent must decide ior him or herseli.

Everyone who is anxious to ”get. in.
to things“ usually ﬁnds that there is
plenty to do and during the last two
years in college it will be necessary to
decide caroiolly just what is best to
engage in We believe that this is a
question which willwork itseli cut.
The outside activities oi the college
seem to be very well distributed this
year ltud witiilhe steps the iacnlr‘y
are taking to lind,who are the pro:

organizations, a good and equitable
adjustment will be reached.

“Everything around college isboom-
lug". This is a remark that has oiten
been heard during the past two years
and to those who has,‘oeer'i in school
ior three or {our years is a remark
that is full oitruth. There has been
lively competition ior placeswm all
our athletic teams or else we would
not have won two state champions
ships last year It some my men
didn’t try out for ﬁve vacant posi-
tions on the glee club that organiza—
tion wouldn’t be so iavorably known
over the state. Every college eaten
prise has been leyally supported and

pride in the college. The Scarlet and
Black ior the past two years has
shared the general prosperity and has
been well supported by the student
body. Last year with 600 students
there were over 200 subscriptions, and
this year the number ought to be
equaled and even increased, It the
paper is to be published only ior a
minority oi the students, than we
might as well cease to make its ire:
presentative sheet All we ask ior is
200 student subscriptions. Suscribe

now and help make the S. St B. one
