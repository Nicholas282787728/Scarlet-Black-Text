Qﬁhitarial

it is said that the phrase, "keep on
the walks" is merely an inyunction
nottolet the grass grow under your
ieet.

The man who meets you on the
campus and insists on telling you that
we are “having our March weather
now” is no more worthy your con-
ddenee than a bankrupt greenhouse.

Awarding class Numerals

The appearance on the campus yes
terday morning oi a newly received
line oi men‘s ierseys marked the open-
ing oi a new custom in Town College.
At least it is hoped that it will be
come a custom in the school. The
Sophomore men whowore the Jerseys
counted umong their number several
who had been or especial value in their
class on account or their athletic
ability. The use oi this ability ior
the good oi the class they have re.
'warded by giving the right oi wearing
the class numeral as a prooi oi their
prowess on the athletic ﬁeld, This is
acustom in vogue' in many schools
md is [ully as reasonable a thing to
do as to give a college emblem. in a
school 'uuch as ours whére the success
or the college athletics depends so
largely upon the training received in
class contests it seems especially

The Walks We ”Keep On”

Although the signs which have
appeared on the campus in the last
week have heed the cause or many
jokes and comments, it is generally
understood that they are to be laken
in all seriousness and the warning they
carryheeded. This is as it should be,
and it is hoped that students will at
least refrain from following in the
worn paths and allow the grass to re-
turn to its natural state of greeuness.

Not all people iollow the ioiunctiou
to “keep on the walk.” In one case
there isa good excuse ior disregarding
the signs, and we feel certain that it
this cause is removed the student body
will do its share toward taking care of
the grass. The case in question is in
regard tothe walks around the library.
For several weeks they have olIered a
chance ior may a twisted ankle,
rivalling in their willingness to trap
the ieet oi the unwary student the
water spouts which were long sincv
removed. Vi'hnt was formerly but a
small space between the boards has
widened intoa yawning chasm and woe

be to the ioot which gets thrusttliere~
in. no one time only the daintier
shoeoi the coed was in danger, hut
now even the manly boot oi the other
sex ishable to ﬁnd itseli caught be-
tween the planks, so large have the
holes there become. We hope tore
speedy removal or this one cause oi
disregard oi the signs it is in a place
wheregood walks are badly needed,ror
very soon new grass will be growing
c‘ose by and there will be double

reason to “keep on the Walks.”

“THIRTEEN" NO HOODOO.
(Continued lronl Flrsl Pazcl
new line oi boosting was especially
well received. The promptness with
which the alumni responded to the in-
vitation to sing the last song, was
gratliying.

The reception eiter the concert was
loss largely attended than beiore, but
no less enjoyed by those there. Both
church and gymnasium were prettlly
decorated.

The song or the “Original Boosters"
song to the tune of “Solomon Levi”

is given in part as follows, the ﬁrst
Stanza being the chorus:

We are the original masters
[n this townot old Gl‘innDH,

We boost. the College in the state
And other snares as Well.
- me Milne to California
We write her glorious name

We roam the mighty country o'er
’l‘o sing her splendid lama.

We boost the cement campus walks
Th tr don't. go anywhere

liipeciaily in the middle
Where thev need a boostior icir:

eni gravel walks and cinders are
So iar behind the time

To tell you what we think oi them
’Tis hard to make a rhyme.

And while we are about it
We will merely ask you why,

The mud on the streets and crossings
Still oilends the public eye

liever anything neederl a boost
We are periectly iraok ro tell

it is a Solid pavement
For the streets oi old Grinnell.
