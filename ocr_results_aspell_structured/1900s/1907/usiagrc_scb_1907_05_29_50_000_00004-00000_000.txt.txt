Main’s home, the Minor Greek stiie
dents gave a reading 01‘ Aristophanes
jcomeoy, “The Frogs.” While no at

r itempt was made at a ﬁnished pro-

“auction, the presentation was much
euroyed by all present. The transla-
tion brought out to remarkable
degiee the humor oi the old Greek
which is iiuita
modem in tone. All the parts were
given readily and shouted the results
olstudy‘and thought. Especially to
be commended was the translation or
the part oi Euripides by Missl’ackard,
cfAescliylus by Miss Moore, and oi
Dinnysius by iir Lyman. The costum-
ing was good so tar as attempted.
AfLer the reading light refreshments
were served. There were a number

of Greek students and the Faculty
present.
