ed the Applied Christianity classes on
Monday and Tuesday and out of the
experience ol‘ 2. long life gave valuable
advice and counsel. His subject on

character is habit. The man of good
habits is the prince royal oi this
world and to rot-m such a character,
man must be in sympathy with Lind
and with man.

On Tuesday Mr Wallace discussed
”Christ's Sermon on the Mount,” and
brought out new and striking teach-
iugs in this great discourse. It {ur-

nishes the solution, he declared. or
every sort oi problem in every depart»
ment oi life. “The Golden Rule” is
the sum and substance of all the iliuie
reaches.

impressive speaker and llls hearers
