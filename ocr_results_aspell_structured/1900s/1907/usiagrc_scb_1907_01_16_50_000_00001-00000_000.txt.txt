A NEW IDEA.

C. E. Fisher Promulgalcs a Plan at
Student Council For Simplifying ‘
Financial Aifnll's,
Get an “Opinion" card.

At'the lirst meeting oi the Student

Council this year a plan oi great iin»
portaiiceiiirhe liie at Iowa College

was proyected by 0. Fisher. It is
one which if adopted at Grinnell will
radically change the condition oi
things and greatly simpliiy what. is
na'v the cause or much labor and con-
iusion. The idea is that or a compul-
sory fee, paid by each sLudellt at the
beginning or every semester, the same
to cover several of the regular college
lunctions oi the year.

The plan has been under considera-
tion for some time and is the result of
much study and work by Mr. Fisher.
MI. McGowan and President Main.
The proposition is as follows: That,
at the time or the payment or the
regular tuition at the lirst or each
semester oi the school year each stu-
dentsliall pay a fee oitliree dollal‘s.For
this fee all students shall receive free
admission to all numbers 0( the
lecture course and the recital course,
to all athletic events and to the home
concert of the Glee Club and shall also
be released from payment otatliletin
union dues.

This system is one adopted at Be-
loitlnst year with almost the unani-
mous approval or all the students
and is also in iorce at Ames and
Morningsideror athletic events. in
support or the proposition Mr Fisher
presented statistics to show that the
tinancial situationyvould be adequate
ly met.

Every student in Iowa College must
think seriously-tn this plan. To ev-
