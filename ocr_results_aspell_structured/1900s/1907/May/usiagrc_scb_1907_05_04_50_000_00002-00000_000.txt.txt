Music (or his Non Musical.

The amount of publicity which has
been given the Coming musical festi—
Val makes it sure that its occurence
will be known to all; the real merit of
the music and musicians Will attract
all who appreciate such merit, While
many who are more or less indiilerent
to music Will attend from the mere
desirew learn. Still, there remains
a class of people to whom no phase of
the program appeals, These are the
people whose musical ideals are realiz-
ediu ragtime produced on a phonar
graph and who shun anythingstmnger
than “Old Black Joe.” They assert
that asymphony orchestra is beyond
their ken but investizzation shows
that their knowledge 0i one is often
conﬁned to the girl in the country
town who plays “Traumerei” on two
Strings.

That an organ or piano rcclldl does
not appeal to one is no proof that :L
symphony orchestra’s music will be
lost upon lllm.

I! there is any music in a man some
part or the program oi a symphony
oralleslln musL reach it. Probably
only a small part or the program will
be of interest but it few numbers
pleasingly played will mean more to
the cue pleiisod than he can estimate

it you hare never heard a Symphony
Orallrstm and are only guessing llizit
its music will not cppenl to you, wily
not give it the trial now‘.’ II it pleas»
