THE FRESHMAN DEBATE.

On Saturday evening. Feb. ll, will
occur the annual Freshman rlebatebe-
bweeu'lhe representatives of the Grin-
nell Institute and Chrestomathian
Societies. The question underdiscus
Siori is one that has often been de-
bz‘iteu and yet it is a question that al-
ways has fresh interest because or the
constant development and change in
the methods or city government, The
question is: “Resolved, That in cities
of the United States over 100.000 pop-
ulation the entire executive and ad»
ministrative power should be vested
in the may or. The comptroller and
treasurer elected. The mayor has
Veto power.”

Tile Chrestom‘dthlan Society will
support the afﬁrmative and her repre
senlatives are Jasper Moore, Ralph
Hulcliins rind J. A. Darner. The in
stitute Society has the negative and
Fred Murphy, Roy B, Lockwood and
Harry Bl'undage will support this side
of the question. These men have all
been working hard tor the past sir
weeks and a debate as interrsrlng and
instructive as the freshman contest of
last year is promised. The debme will
begin at .. sharp in the college
Chapel so that in will not inierfere
seriously with the other events oi the

 

evening.

that may bear even creme.- lruittliim

President Mom's speech contained
some startling facts in demonstration
otthe reason why we should respond
to the immediate demands In colri~
paring our own institution with other
institutions of the middle wesc and
many of the east, by placing cold facts
side by side, he showed conclusively
that it was impossible for us to try to
exist on the present basis and com-
pete with State Universities and
other heavily endowed colleges, While
the student here pays $55.00 tuition it
costs nearly 5150 00 to supply his in-
structiou. He pays aboutiii” oi the
actual cost. The high grade of in-
struction and high standing in scholar-
ship must eventually be sacriliced un-
less the deﬁcit is provided for. We
are not a small college compared with
other institutions. There is not an-
other liberal art college as large West
of Chicago, What. we are trying to
dobhen is to furnish a course of in
struction for a large college on the in-
come ofasmall college. This is im-
possible.

D, W. Norris iii the closing speech
warned the people especially against
irrational “boosting” and Olfered the
suggestion that while the campaign
was being carried out wirh vigor and
energy abroad that a low at home
could help not aliotle by providing lor
