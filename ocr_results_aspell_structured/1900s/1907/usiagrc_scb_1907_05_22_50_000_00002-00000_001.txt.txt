baseball season wheh the people irom
Ames came down with hlood in their
eyes to avenge the loss their traclr
team suiiered the week belore at the
hands oi the Scarlet and Black. They
certainly played t .5 game. They cut-
classed the Grinnell squad in every
department or play, except in the
error column where honors were even.
Grinnell‘s mistakes came at the
wrong times, however. while those oi

to ﬁnd him at all, and those who did

In the alterooori the upper rooms or
