RECITAL MUCH APPREciATED.

R. H. Lyman Gives Pleasing program,
singing Many New FieccsiiTann-
iha‘usel Aria Pleasesi
The postponed recital which Mr.
Lyman was to havegiven iu_ the win-
ter, was presented last night at the
chapel before very appreciative
audience. The opinion is prevalent
that Mr. Lyman has never been heard
to better advantage than at last
night’s recital, and it is undoubtedly
true that in artistic interpretation
and technical ﬁnish, he has'impvoved

very much since last year.

The greatest enthusiasm was arous»
ed by the well loved Tdnuhﬁluser re-
citative the Aria "o thou sublit'ne
sweet aveniugsbal‘,” whioli was sung
to a piano and ‘cello accompaniment,
and heartily encored.
"GypsyJolln“piovlded a stirringlast
number, aithough the greatest suc-
cess was achiercd inthc quieter num-
bers, such as the "Folk Song" by
)[aclloweii whichwas in some ways
the most beautiful tiling sung. A
