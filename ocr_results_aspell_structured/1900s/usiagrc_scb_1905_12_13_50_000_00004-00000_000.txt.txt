Owing to the iaot that. there will be
only one more issue or the paper beiore

the Christmas vacation, the SCARLET

AND BLACK management. has decided

to postpone the last. issue until Mun.-
day or next week in order to include

some events that otherwise would be

omitted.

The railroads have granted the usu-

a1 rate pl one and one-third (are to the

students and teuoherr or Iowa. College.

for tile Holiday recess. These rates
Will be given on December 20 and ‘21,
and good for return until January 3.
Those desiring to take advantage of
these rates are requested to call at
Mr. Robbins’ oflice for the certiﬁcates
which should be presented to the Link-
an agent as early as possible in order
that. the tickets may be made out in
advance.

CHAMEER MUSIC CONCERTS.
(Continuell (roll! 1"

‘ Kiting the composition askilllull,
sympathetic interpretation winch
Iairly aroused the emliusiasin oilils
listeners. The organ liccompoliiinent
proved more satisfactory than would
hare seemed possible. Tliepcrrorm-
once should lie repeated when the new
church organ is completed. the large
Church auditorium being much belle:
adapted to so tremendous a com posi-
tion than the chapel. If this be the
slow movement of the concerto which
iir. Framptou played, their one may
almost be pardoned for desiring to
hear the rapid movements for Sheer
(‘nriosity’s sake.

But one thing mailed the pleasure
oi the two evening‘s programs and
that was due to the unfortunate fact
thatille patrons of the Iowa College
School of Music recital course have (un-
iortunately ior themselves) acquired
the habit of enjoying a. little fresh air
now and then even though listening
to that which migiit be supposed lo
lead their minds to acontemplation of
higher things than mere physical Com-
lort. A habit of breathing aetiuiretl
liy long years of practice cannot be
laid asideso lightly however even dur-
ing the brief course or such a program
and unless some proviSlon for more
fresh air in the chapel is mlrde both
performers and nudience must lose
their keenness for the music. especially
during the latter pzlrt, oi the evening.
