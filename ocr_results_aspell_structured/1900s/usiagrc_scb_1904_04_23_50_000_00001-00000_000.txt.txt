FRIDAY MoRNlNG‘S CHAPEL

The First Vistt ofa Highland Park Pms
lessor Thoroughly cn,oycd_lvrr,
Greenwood's Address.

Yesterday morning in chapel,
Prof. Greenwood, of Highland
Park, gave the students a most
interesting and instructive talk,
one which cart afford them much
food for serious thought. The
message tvhich he endeavored to
bring before the students was tltat
oi the real signiﬁcance and the
Iresult of the school work which
too often seems irksotne to him.

Our work should all be ill
cord with some ideal and this
ideal should ultimately be to take
our humble place as best we may
in the perfection of God's plan.

There are c e rta i n fundar
mentals bearing directly on this,
which our school work should de
velop. In the first place, we
must get our working tools to a
keen edge, that is, the intellect
with which we have all been err»
clawed by nature should be train—
ed in order to secure the best,and
it istlte ﬁrst duty of an educational
institution to attend to this No
student should neglect to culivate
his personality or that which goes
to make up another’s impression
of him. Personality, although we
cannot analyze it, comes ﬁnally
irorn our moral and spiritual
natures and its cultivation, there-
fore, depends upon our nature
and the care which we give
these two sides of our being.

Prof. Greenwood impressed the
students as being a really thought
ful and able christian man and the
touches of humor with which he
introduced his talk, only served
to heighten the effect of the more
serious part ct his discourse.

FIDELIO.

The Story or the Opera Which is To Be
oiven May 13 by the Orr
atorio Soctciy.

The scene of the opera is laid
in Spain. For sonic politcal of
ferlsc Don Florestan is conﬁned
in a fortress, at the mercy of an
enemy, who has caused trim to be
placed in one of the lowest tlunr
geons, with the intention ofslow-
Iy starving hint to death. His
faithful wife, Leonora, resolved
to satisfy herself as to the truth
of his reported decease, obtains
admission to the castle, and, in
the digitisc of a boy. is hired into
the service of Racco, the jailer.
Dori Pizarro, having been in-
formed that Don Fernando, the
minister, is about to visit the pris
on, endeavors to persuade Racco
to kill Dori Florestan, which he re-
tuses, but consents to dig his
grave if Don Pizarro will himself
commit the murder.

Leonora, partialy overheating
takes advantage of the passion
with which as a boy site has in-
spired the jailor's daughter,l Mar-
celline (who is afﬁanced to la-
quio, the porter) and thinking
that Don Florestan's life may be
the one inteitded to be sacriﬁced
persuades Rocco to let her ac-
cotnpany him to the dungeon as
an asststant. On entering the
coil Leonora immediately knows
her husband by his voice, btit
conceals her emotion and helps
Racco (llg the grave. When all
is prcpared,Don Pizarro attempts

to stab his prisoner but is pres
vctltcd by Leonora who. declarr
Ing herself to be blorcstan’s wife,
resolutely places herself between
them. Don Pizarro iii baffled
rage is about to sacriﬁce botit to
his iury. when Leonora draws a
pistol and keeps him at bay. At
this moment the arrival of the
minister, Don Fernando, is‘herr
aided by a tiumpet cull. On his
appei‘ancc an explaitlatlon is dc-
irianderl, Don Pizarro's deeply
laid plot is discovered. and Leon-
ora,s devotion rewarded by the
immediate release of her his
band.

sioiiary. Tire lecture was |isten~
ed to With interest by everyone
and the life of that famous man
was told tna most entertaining
way. Dr. Cady always pleases
Grinnell audiences and last evettr
ing he was at his best.

After the invocation by Profes~
scrr Noble, President Heeren of
the Y. M. C. A. introduced Mr.
Cody to his audience. Some of
the more important features of
Livingstone's discoveries and jotirr
neys were shown with slides,
which added greatly in making
his talk realistic. He spoke in
pair as tolloivs;

All human beings are possessed
with the spirit of tvandeiing; all
are tramps. Livtngslone has this
passion but also a greater
one, the passion tor Christ. He
was the son at poor and pious
parents and it was the boast
of his grandfather that no Living-
stone had ever been a liar. This
quality of tl'uthlullness was not
lacking in Livingstone for when
after his ﬁrst trip into the center
of Africa, he reached the coast
more dead than alive and ltad
found a ship there ready to take
him home, he refused to go but
went back ovcr that journey of
4,500 miles inrthc one rcasonthat
he had promised his black ser-
vantstltat hc would bring them
honre again and hekept his prom-
ise though at the risk of his life.

life to become a medical mission-
ary, and he ﬁrst thought otChina,
but the opium war changed his
plans and then he turned to
Africa,

Livingstone had three objects
in view in exploring Africa. i,
To open the way to commerce. 2,
To penetrate central Africa so as
to abolish the slave trade. 3. To
open a held‘tcrniissioiiory labors.

He made three trips into Africa
