$URING a college course a
' sludent leurns many les-
sons, not all of which are in the
regular curriculum, Last Satur-
day Grinnell students had the op»
portunity of learning a lesson
which all students ought to have
learned betore going to College,
but which it was evident some
students had not done. When the
Ames tootbnll team returned irom
Iowa City a crowd of hoodlum
students rushed into the Glinnell
depot to raid the lunch counter,
We recognize that the older stu
dents regret such things, but those
who were guilty offer a striking
example of how little the college
atmosphere can do to restrain
those who are naturally cal eless of
the rights of others. These stu
dents did not act as gentlemen in
' any way and were a disgrace to
any college. Time may give them
different ideas, and it is to be
hoped that experience will show
them that disregard tor the prop
. erty of others is not sport. such
action is directly in line with the
conduct of certain Ames under-
classmen who snatched colors and
r pennants from Grinnell girlsnr the
time of the Ames-Grinnell game,
We are glad that the larger numr
ber of Ames students do not
countenance such things but those
who are unable to control their
oun conduct should be lestlained

by some outside pon-cr.

WOMEN'S TENNIS TOURNAMENT,

Although the weather has been
nntavorable there has been quite
a revrval of interest in tennis this
tall. Followingt he men’s tour~
nament in the spring, both men
and women planned tournments
for this term, and the women's con-
tests have been going on tor two
weeks. For someyears there has
been little or no interest in tennis.
student enthusiasm having gone
to other sports, but it seems as if
the revival of tennis which has
occurred over the state has also af-
fected Grinnell. The women's
tournment included only singles
and the tour players left at the
end of the week were Mabel
Smith, Bertha Edmunds, Rachel
Ravelland MabelDunbar. These
tour were to play for the women’s
championship of the college thls
week. Miss Ravel] defeated Miss

weather prevented turther play

Dunbar and Miss Edmunds play.
