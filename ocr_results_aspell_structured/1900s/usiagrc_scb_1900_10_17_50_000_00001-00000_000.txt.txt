Professor Macy’s New Book,

Professor Macy’s new book.
“Political Parties in the United
States.” hasjust appeared from the
press or the Macmillan Company.
It is a neat 12 mo. volume, bound
in half leather, and is one of a
*series entitled “The Citizens’ Li-
brary of Economics, Politics, and
Socialogy” issued under the gen-
eral editorship of Prof. Richard
T. Ely of the University of Wis~
Consin. The purpose ofthe book
is to describe the American party
system betweenthe years i846 and
1861.

The early history ofpartyorgane
ization in the United States and
also the nature ofthe party system
as developed after the ci il war
has recently received considerable
attention from various writers.
But it is a curious fact that the rise
and growth of political parties in
the period between the Mexican
and Civil \vars has never been
adequately covered. Thus Pro-
fessor Macy’s comprehensive and
reliable exposition of the subject
comes very opportunely. and will
be welcomed not only by students
but by the general public as well.

The ﬁrst four chapters give a
broad view of the origin and na-
ture ofthe Modern Political Party,
theAmerican Party System, Party
Issues, the Spoils System and
Party Organization in general.

The remaining eighteen chap-
ters take up in detail the working
of the American Party System in
the periodintervening between the
Mexican and Civil wars. The
author distinctly says, however,
that thepai-ty system is a unit, and

that no onc period of its history
can be understood until all are
understood. Always keeping in
mind this comprehensive idea of
political unity, he proceeds to
study the perfected party machine
as it was being tested during that
strenuous period. The general
conclusion arrived at by this dis-
cussion may be concisely summed
up in the following short para»
graphfromthepreface: ”Theold
Federal party died because it was
uneAmerican in the form of its
organization. Under the party
names ofWhig and Democrat the
system reached a high degree of
perfection; but there was a malad-
justment between the party ma-
chinery and public opinion. the
parties went to pieces, and the
civil war wasthe result. This vol-
ume (the preface continues) treats
especially of the great Whig fail~
ure and its consequences."

Thus in a broad and scholarly
manner Prof. Macy deals with the
Party System as one of the great
unifying factors in our national
life. The subject is one of inter
est to all. and the characteristicalr
ly lucid treatment makes it a very
interesting and instructive book.

Professor Macy’s other works
are “The English Constitution," a
commentary on the nature and
growth of the English Political
System; “Our Government," a
study of the general, state, and
local governments of the United
States; and an abridgement of Pro
fessor James Bryce’s “American
Commonwealth."

Mr. Wishard’s Address.

Mr, Wishard's address before
the Associations Sunday evening
partook largely of the nature of an
evangelistic appeal. Since Mr.
Wishard spoke tothe students 15
years ago he has spent a number
of years visiting foreign mission-
ary ﬁelds. Hence he came to us
with a ripe experience concerning
the attitudes taken by foreign
people toward Christianity.

His object in visiting the nine
hundred students of Doshisha
University, Japan, was to convey
to them the greetings of the
church in America and Europe.
Three hundred of these students
are Christians.

In an afternoon conversation
with forty noanhristian men he
went over the reasons for believ-
ing Jesus Christ equal to God.

The ﬁrst stage of belief is but
an intellectual operation, You
can keep on believing that Jesus
lived as long as you live without
its doing you any good, Asked
what it is to believe in a man they
replied that it was to have conﬁ-
dence in him. In reading over
the ﬁrst few verses of John 1, they
noted the words bcliM/z and re-
m‘m as the most prominent.
When you receive a man you re-
ceive him as a friend, teacher,
ruler, etc. Thus step by step he
brought these students to see that
the point was to simply takeJesus
as a gift -
