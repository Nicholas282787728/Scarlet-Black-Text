After the Bruins“ meet at a week
ago We can not help Wishing that the
state Championship in track was de-
cided by a. series at dual meets instead
of a general meet of all the colleges.
As far '5 comparing the strength of
any two schools is concerned a dual

meet is the only \v' , to do it. In the

state meet each year it is the school
that has tuo or three good stars that
wins the meet, no matter how weak

the remainder or the team may be.

The trainer nlio can produce an all
around and well Ilalanced track team
is iar ahead 01' the trainer who can io-
cate a few stars. it is the dual meet
that shows up the comparative
strength (11 [“0 schools in [his ‘espect
and not the state meet. Just as it sug'
gestion \\‘ would not a series or dual
meets between the Vai‘lﬂns colleges be
a iairer war 01 deciding the Chan)—
pionship than the present state meet
til‘i'a“gainer-LiAmes Student, Mar 13,
mos.

The athletic editor of the .iines Stu-
dent suggests that the state meet be
abolished and that series of duals be
subsiitllleﬂ, The stiite meet has alu-ais
been the great traelt event or low
and it will continue to hold this dis
tinetioii. The state nieet iii other
states and the general conference
meets all\' ex'eite more Inte'i'esl.
than a selics oi duals nossiblr could.

But Amos s that a dual is a tan:
or test of the strength ot a team than
the state nieet wheie stars ﬁgure only
whether the remainder of the mom is
well balanced or not. Let'. see. in

thirteen men on the s. U. 1. team took
