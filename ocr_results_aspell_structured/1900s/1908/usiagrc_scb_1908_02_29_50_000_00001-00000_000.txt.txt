tice Work.

With the approach oi spring the
Iowa College students' iancy lightly
turns to thoughts at track athletics.
The memories at last year's successes.
both at state and conference meets,
and the excellent amount oi material
in school give a very optimistic turn
to aiiairs. For several weeks- the
more prominent athletes have been in-
dulging in gymnasium work and are
beginning to get in trim ior the long
siege at training.

No very deﬁnite arrangements have
been made, as yet. with regard to the
scheduling oi meets. The dates (or
the Class ppm and Home meets, will
depend very much on the date which
is ﬁnally set (or the Ames meet, but
will probably be April 11 and 17 re»
spectively. Tile Ames meet has been
deﬁnitely arranged and it is probable
that the usual meet will be arranged
with Drake, although it is not settled
yet. Tile State meet will be held my
23 and 29 at Dos Monies, and a team
will, oi course, be sent to the conicrr
ence meet in Chicago, the date oi

A presentation oi the great increase

oi culivge men going into business

plls the theme oi the talk yesterday
moiuipg by Professor Wyckoii.

The cllatel's ci, a number oi old,
9’ llllivel‘silie. .were quoted showing
the narrow ideas oi the purpose oi a
college course a tow decades ago.
lowo College was lolllldedion liberal
principles and the purpose oi the
courses are to ﬁt inch and women
with a good, well rounded education.

A row years ago only two per cent
01' the graduates of Yale entered bus-
incss. Today over to per cent enter.
Tile same comparison holds ior nearly
every college in the country. Business
is regarded today as a proiession and
is looked upon as demanding the same
preparation as for a pi-elessional ca-
reer. The sons oi business men are
attending college in greater numbers
and usually rollow a business career.
A [lluzl Wile lnalle (a the students as a
uhole to iiuish their course. students
as a whole are [00 apt to specialize
more than is canola-Lent With ii well
rounded course and olten the greatest
good is obtained ironi courses in which
we are at ﬁrst least interested.

The talk was interesting throughout
”nil was given close attention.
