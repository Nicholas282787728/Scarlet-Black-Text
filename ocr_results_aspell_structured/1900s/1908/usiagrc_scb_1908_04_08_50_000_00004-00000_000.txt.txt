done among them this week by Mr. E.
C. ercor.
Mr. Mercer is a. man who has ex-
Del'iellcell nll the trials and lemlltav
tions not only of college men out or
men of the world, has fallen before
these. and has made a magniﬁcent
recovery. His culture and pleasing
manner place him in poﬁltioll to make
a peculiarly powériul' appeal to the
average college mall.

The meeting Monday night in the
Y. .\I. C. A rooms was eslldmalll' slic-
cessflll and the room was more than

ﬁlled. )Il'. Mercer occupied the time

in relating Llle mistakes at his own
lite and droning trout them some use-
lul applications.

iereuces and the evening in talks at
diiioront rooming houses and hearti-
illg oluhs, where a large pumher or
men were to be Ioulld together. 311'.
Mercer is especially eitectlre in this
work and the results were very saris»

This morning Mr. Mercer spoke lnr
