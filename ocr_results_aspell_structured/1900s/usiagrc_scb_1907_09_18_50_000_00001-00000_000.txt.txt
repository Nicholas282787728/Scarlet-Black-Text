THE OPENING RECEPTION.

Rand Gymnasium Scene of
Fasrivily.

Tire Freshman class made its initial
how to the college on Saturday even-
rng and may now be said to be proper--
ly “out,” in college society. The debu-
tante was received with marked at.
rention, all the older students, many
01 the alumni and most oi the Facility
'iraving gathered to do her honor. The
gymnasium was gayei- than usual with
imposing arrays or many colored pens
nants hung from the ceiling and the

air-let and black draped ir-om the

'gallery. Frappe was served lrom
several tables, and the inevitable
"Who are you?" cards added to the
easy iniormalty oi the chair.

Mr. Ralph Garner, chair-man or the
committee on arrangements, called a
halt in the sociebrlity litter in the
evening, and alter a levy words oi wel»
come to new and cldirlends, introdun.
ed President Main. The PreSidentls
address was short and cor-dial, ex~
pressing the feeling of college unity,
which the entire occasion made ap-
parent, Miss Sheldon, newly elected
Dean oi Women, iollowed with a briei
sketch oi the marn rdea her new work
should iollorv, and Dr. Steiner. in his
own, individual way mingled a bit of
ﬂattery and a bit of admonition in a
nice adjustment of fun and serious
lriendship. One lecture oi the Re»
ception was omitted to the regret oi
allitlle usual song by the Glee Club.

The other time honored customs oi
General Receptions were luily observ-
ed. Many oi the iamiliar yells or past
and gone classes were given with a
rim by the representatives oi those

classes present. 1907 was especially
in evidence while ’06, '05 and '02 had
many members, and ntlrer e a r l i e r
classes were represented by loyal
alumni.

FOOTBALL.

With the taking up oi his work by
Coach Hamilton Monday night the
iootbell season lor 1907 began in earn-
est, From this time Li‘s Old men will
be out and all efforts will be concen-
trated lor a vretoriorrs team, and indi
vidually, for places on the team. The
ﬁeld has been fenced oil. the grand-
stand will be moved shortly and itlto-
gether things on Ward Field are be.
ginning to assume an appearance very
much resembling Foot brill.

Lest iiiglittiicre were abolittwenly-
live men out in uniior-m Last year’s
Varsity men who were out were Cami»
bell, iiarlson, Bleamaster, Pierce,
Flanagan, Clack and McCarty. In atl-
dition to these there were a large
number of other Eligible men and Sel'r
eral lirst year men although the prac-
nice for the Freshman team has not
yet begun in earnest. Other eligible
men who have expressed their inter-l»
tion oi donning the moleskins in a iew
days, are H. Kisser, Turner. llosmel‘,
Carroll, Murray and Gill.

Coach Hamilton, last night conlined
the men to work in throwing and kick-
ing the ball. starting. and backﬁeld,
using rive men to each squad. As the
Week progresses there Will probably be
somesignal and formation work, bub
scrimmage Will scarcely be indulged
in {or Sonia timeyeb. The hot weath-
er of the last few dill s, the class Scraps
aml other things have interfered some-
What with the work, but 35 El rule the
fellows are sticking at it Willi nde»
termination which uuaurs Well.

At the Freshman "slag” banquet
lust night arrangements wall; made
[or a Freshman team, and Joe Reese
\Vifs elected captain. This team will
be made up ﬁrst year men, and under
the leadership of Reese who has had a
world or football experience at ids
Grove, asuccessiul team is expected.
Coach Hamilton has promised his
help in coaching and arranging a.
schedule which is a very riii’llcultr work
for such atearn, due to the limited
amount of opposition in the state.
Games will probably be arranged how.
ever with several high schools and
college lreshman teams.

Altogether the outlook is very en—
couraging and Grinnell supporters
may expect their team toploy a prom—
inent part in the state championship
race.

Trainer 0 E. Fisher stated lust
night that the Handicap meet and
inner-class relay rates would be held
about the middle 0! October, although
the due has not been deﬁnitely set»
tiled. The inter-class cross country
run will take place Now. ‘Jth accord-
ing to present plans.
