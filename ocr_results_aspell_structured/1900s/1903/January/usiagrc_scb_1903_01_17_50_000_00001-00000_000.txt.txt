GRINNELL DEFEATS PELLA,

The Hollanders Lose a One.sided Game
by a Score at 24-5.

Last evening in the men's gym-
nasium about zoo people saw
Grinnell win an easy victory in
basketball, irom’the Central Uni-
versity team, score 24 to 6.

The visitors were cut-played in
every department of the game
and their lack of team work and
physical training were especially
noticeable. Captain Jo h n s o n,
however, played a strong game
and made a most sensational bas—
ket from the center of the court
in the second half.

All of the home team played a
a strong game, and ought to make
a record for themselves before
the season is over. Captian Wil»
son and Clark did especially good
work in throwing baskets.

The local gymnasium

gave a short exhibition between
halves, which was enthusiastically
received by the audience. They
did very creditablywork, consider-
ing the (act that they were handi-
capped bytheabsenceoiWalleser,
who was unable to be present,
and they have just begun training
this term. The iollowing is the
lineup of the basket ball teams:

THE NEW PICTURES in THE
CHAPEL.

Two exceptionally Fine photo-
graphs have been placed upon the
walls oi the Chapel by the meme
her: of the Faculty Circle. They
represent the prophet Esaias or
Isaiah and the Erithraean Si_byl,
two of the most remarkable
ﬁgures in the wonderlul series oi
prophets and srbylsthatsurronntls

the preparation ior his coming.
The prophets represent the Old
Testament visions of a World
Redeemer, the slbyls are the em-
bodiments oi pagan prophecy,
wherein are seen iaint glimmer-
ings of the light that is to be upon
the earth.

Michael Angelo is not primarily
a painter but a sculptor, and hrs
paintings are distinctly sculptures-
queﬁphotographs, thereiore, give
a more adequate view of them
than oi most paintings, The
architectural framework around
the ﬁgures is an illusion of the
painter's art, making them look
lile sculptured ﬁgures in the
niches at a magniﬁcent marble
structure. There is no back-
ground oi natural scenery. The
paramount interest is the human
one.

For these ﬁgures are intensely
human, though their majestic pro-
portions and proiound absorption
intheir search for eternal truth
have made them seem to some
observers to belong to a realism
above the human. Certainly it is
not a common phase of experience
that is embodied, this overmaslerr
ing desire to pierce the veil that
separates the ﬁnite from the in-
ﬁnite, btit it is none the less real,
none the less human, none llre less
elemental. Marvellous beyond
comparison is the power and dis
tinctness of individuality that
lives In the ﬁgures. We can not
use a weaker word than ‘lives'.
so vivid is the impression of
poweriul personality upon the be-
holder. This can be appreciated
iully only aitcr comparison with
the other ﬁgures in the series,
each of which carries out the con-
ception common to them, all in so
indivrdual a way that they greatly
reenforce oneanother. Their
strong individuality is expressed
in the whole ﬁgure; in the attitude,
in the position of the feet and
hands, even in the arrangement
of the drapery. We are accustom
ed to look to the face tor the ex»
pressron of thought and of feeling.
Michael Angelo ﬁnds in the other
parts- of the body just as great ex
pr 'vc power. The calmnessoi
thc l-ilhl‘aean Slbyl is indicated
quite as much by the absence of
tension in her hand and arm as by
the serenity of her face. Ill tlic

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY. JANUARY I7, 1903.

Esa 5 he has given to the loot,
often a‘dishonored member, the
“more abundant honor" of help-
ing to reveal the inner inlensily to
theprophet'sspirit. Thedrapery
oi the sibyl lies in easy and grace
iul iolds. Esaias' garment is
carried backward by the sweep oi
some impulse in the direction at
the vision to wllich the attendant
spirit is pointing.

Very characteristic oi Micheal
Angela's art are the youthiul
spirits which attend each prophet
and sibyl, Personiﬁcaiions, per-
haps they are, of the spirit oi
prophecy itself. One fancies he
can see in their attitude some sug-
gestion oi the degree of in-
spiration» attributed to the seer.
They are engaged in lighting the
lamp of the Erithraean Sibyl, the
lamp which is to illuminate the
inspired page she is studying.
Much more signiﬁcant are their
books and gestures in the repre-
sentation of Esaias. The eager
face of one of them is illuminated
by a flash of light, which, in the
original, is said to light up the
ﬂoating edge oi the prophets
