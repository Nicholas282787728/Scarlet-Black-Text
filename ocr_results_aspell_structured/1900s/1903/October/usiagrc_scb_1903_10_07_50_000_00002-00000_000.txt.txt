HROUGH no fault. oi hci-

of AllcSOuH has raiely been heard
of in Grinncll in an athletic way
except through an occasional ball
game n-inch ourtearn may have
had at Columbia. It is eridcnt
now. however. to all that me
watching western institutions of
learning that Missouri has toll in-
tentions ot making her athletic
department keep pace with the
lcimtiiy strides of her progress in
other directions. The large an
roiinien: nitgoorl sll-toulidcqtttpe
merit of the University have given
her claims to recognition as a tootr

of the
parent Slump in tire iiiaikel value
of places on the scrub team it can
e'asily be saidthat the condition is
unsatistacrory. When, tor the
third time in seven years. there
are not enough candidates out to
matte a second team. something is
radically wrong. The condition
was such at last night's practice.
Scrubs shotild remember that the
prospect for promotion is never
lost and that the Varsity can not
be made what it should be with-
out their co-opcratioii. Time
never was when a position on a
Grinnell team could be held with-
out relentless work or gained with-
out the rncst strenuous effort. As
eternal Vigilance is the price ol
safety so is constant striving the
price otavarsrty positionand only
unabated etiort gives permanent
title when it once is gained.
