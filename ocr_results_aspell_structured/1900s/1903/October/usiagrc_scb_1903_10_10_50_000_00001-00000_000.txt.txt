the more shameful in that it could
have been averted by pertect cos

within late years there seems
to have grown up among certain
students the idea that places in
our athletic teams are made, not

A PERSONALITY,

Dr. Steiner a Busy Mamiﬂow He

Spends His Time.

Often in the hurry and bustle
of the busy student life, while our
intersls are so closely centered in
our oivn little community heie,
we lose much of our sense of per
spective. In the press of rccita»
tions and experiments, examina-
tions and reports, ive are prone to
pass by. in the blindness of self-
absorbtion, much that is really
vital. But iii the aftersyears,
when time has cleared our vision,
with startling force the truth will
come to us that, after all, what
counted was, not the lessons we
learned, but the men who taught
them to us; not the lectures we
heard, but the irequent contact
withthepersonalityotthelecturer.
Among the men and women who
in that keener vision will stand
out in unmistakeable lines is Dr.
Edward A. Steiner, who. although
he has but lately come among us
has already closely allied hims
self with Grlnncll.

DEAN EDSWORTH AMONG US.

His Chapel TalkiFndny Night's Union
r Meeting.

With Friday morning's chapel
began the series of talks to which
allAssociatioripeople havelooked
torward with unusual eager-
ness. If the handling of a noble
themeina simple and iorcetul
manner can make an address in-
spiring it is certain that this one
lacked nothing to make it so,

Power is given, says Mr. Bos-
worth, only into those hands
where in it is safe to leave it. He
tracedthe various processes by
which men are made ﬁt to receive
the power otGod.

At the evening meeting he
dealt with the question: Who is
Christ? Seven of the greatest
features of His character were
enumerated anddweltupon. The
listeners were deeply impressed
with the torcefulness of the ads
dress and they felt, moreover,
that behind the words was a force
of character which made them
doubly worth while.
