LAKE GENEVA

A Beautiful Lake in Southern Wisconsin—"Richly Endowed

by Nature

 

Lake Geneva is one of the ansli
challning little bodies of water in the
world. It hes in ‘Valu‘ortll County,
VViSconsin, well toward the south-
eastern corner of the state, and is
reached by direct lilies of l'dlll‘oad from
Chicago in'about two hours. With a
length of nine miles and a Width vary
ing from Dilerhdlf LO one and one-half
miles, it has inventylonr miles of
bealltillllly woodedslror~o-line,aliording
tlle most delightful locations (or suin-
mer camps and private residences. To»
ward the western elldol' the lake on
the north shore lies the Young Men's
Christian Association camp. The
grounds now include about; nineteen
acres, with six hundred lifty4il'e [est
oflalie frontage. From the water’s
edge a Series of natural terraces rises
to \‘.h(: height of one hundred eighty
iect, where, upoua level stretch. is the
athletic lield ol the camp. Adjoining
the Camp on tlle north and cast are the
grounds of the famous Yellics Astra»
nomical Observatory of Tire University
of Chicago. The observatory, contain»
ing the largest equate al telescope in
the world is Open to visitors on Satur~
(lays. For pictlncsquencss, healthful-
ness and general attractiveness of
surloundings the location is probably
not surpassed in America.

The purpose of the Camp is twofold
fornication and recreation. Courses
of instruction in the Bible and in the
various phases of Association economy
are olTel‘ed to those who desire to take
them. Rest and recreation, however,

 

arestrougattractions icr many and the
swimmer, the oarsman and the yachts-
rnaniind all that the heart can wish
at Lake Geneva. Scores or pleasure
craft or every sort, hour the swiitest.
most graceful and most elegantly ap-
pointed steam-yacht down to the plain
ﬁshermanls row-boat, are owned by the
dwellers along the shore. The public
steamboat service is excellent.

A reception hall with a spacious
veranda ior pleasant weather, and a
large, oldrlas 'oued lire-place for in
clement weather, provides a place for
social gatherings and entertarmneuts

One oi the greatest charms of all to
the average city guest is the fact that
he is out in the woods, close to Nature’s
heart. no isin the midst oi one of
Nature’s “royal pleasure grounds"
where “to breathe is a beatitnde.“
Drawing upon the exhoustless vitality
or Nature his own nature is ireshencd,
his thought deepened, his heart
warmed and his soul replenished, if
he but open his mind he may learn
from Nature great liferlessons and
and she becomes to him “a middle
tel-m between man and God."

The social liIe of the camp is entire-
1 y free now. iormality, is happy, whole-
some and distinctively Christian.
Cor-dial Christian fellowship and spirit-
ual unity abound, llearry rnerriment
and all that makes [or physical and
mental relaxation and agener-al Vital
uplift are the order of each day. Suns
day is sacredly kept asa day or rest
and worship. In consideration or its
superb attractions and the excellence
of its patronage, the camp may well be
called ‘ an ideal summer resort.”

Four well-kept. tennis courts, a

croquet court, a well-ﬁtted athletic
iield and a gymnasium provide
abundantly for manly sport. and exel'r
oisc. Dark-rooms . e at the disposal
of amateur photographers. The iamily
gymnasium class. under one of the
pin ical directors, and the “family
.sr inl” provide frolicking spells [or
young and old of both sexes. The
athletic field has a running track, a
base-ball diamond and sailing yachts
are at the service of guests for a small
rental. For fresh hater bathing Lake
Genera is not surpassed.

For goli enthusiasts the camp has
recently lard ontasi hole course on
which guests of the association camp
may play nporr the payment or a small
ice.

A woedsy tramp of two and ahalr
miles brings one to Lake Como, the
home of the white pond lily. A like
distance in the opposite direction
brings one to the iishcrres, where

‘extensive trout ponds are kept up by

one of the wealthy summer 'idents.
Flvo miles across the country afoot,
awheel or by carriage, takes one to
Delavan Lake, a favorite ﬁshing
ground, The Swill; little steamers
will take the Visitor to any of a score
of beauty spots on the lake. A trolley
ride across Big Foot Prairie to Harvard
ﬁlls up a pleasant hair day. Tire Cir»

season by afew of the strong in limb.

The series of baseball games between
the V Ions colleges, states and sec-
tions, a tennis tournament, a track
meet and other athletic events, includ—
ing water sports, are: ranged. Prof.
\V. B. Olds won the singles in tennis
at the Loulnillnent last season.

 

THE MEN’S CONFERENCE.

Jul-re 19-23,1903,

Lake Geneva has a charmed signiﬁ-
cance throughout the colleges of the
Middle West. Dining more than a
decade it haslent the beauty and quiet
or its shore to the annual Student
Summer Conference for this section.
The recognition of value accorded this
gathering is best attested bp the pres»
errce last year of profe - s and stu-
dents from 150 institutions. Those
colleges are how few and isolated rn
which organized effort is not made to
secure, thr-ough' representation, the
advantages it aliorils.

The best or other years and some
important advances will constitute
the features or the conference of 1903.
Among the platform speaker who
here promised attendance are Mr.John
R. Mott, who is now on his return from
a visit to the students or Australia
and New Zealand, Mr. Robt. E. Specr,
Mr-.i<).'1‘.Colton, Dr. FrankE. Sanders,
Mr. llarlan P. Beach, Proi. Edw. I.
nos-worth of Oberlin, Mr. Harry Morr-
roe or Chicago and D Wm. F. Mo»
Dowcil or New York City. Mr. E. W.
Feel: of Minneapolis will have charge
or the music and be assisted by the
Iowa College Quartette. The Person-
al Workers‘ class will be led by Mr. S.
M. Sayrorrl. The daily Institute for
the study of missions for deepening
and givrng practical direction to the
interest of the delegates, will be under
the direction of Mr. F, P. Turner,
general secretary of the Student Vol-
unteer Movement. A normal class
will be conducted by Mr. C. H. Form
of Pekin, China.

The total expense while in attend-
ance at the ten days‘ conference will
be $15, which will consist or the regis-
tration fee or $5 and board and lodging,
$10. Tire full car fare from Grinnell
to Lake Geneva via Chicago is $11.00,
and if, as usual, one-half fare permits
are granted to the delegates, the car
[are will be covered by that amount.

In the last six years the Young Men’s
Christian Association or Iowa College
has had nineteen dill‘el'ent delegates
and in 1902 only one. No strong col-
lege association can deny the value of
the conference to its work and this
year we should send a delegation to
number at leash eight with our male
quariette.

WHAT GENEVA DOES FOR A car.—
LEGE GIRL.

In the ﬁrst place, a girl who goes to
Geneva will obtain most- excellent sug-
gestions in methods of association
work, both from the conference leaders
and from other students whohave per--
haps solved in their colleges the very
problems with which her association
rs struggling. Valuable as this is,
however, it is but the least part of
what Geneva gives to a girl. When

 

she meets other college girls from any-
