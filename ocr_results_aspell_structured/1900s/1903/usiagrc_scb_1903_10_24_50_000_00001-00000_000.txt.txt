EDITOR "SCARLET AND BLACK",
Dear sir; since manv ques

tions have been asked about ilie
grimy and dust~staineul tomes that
have recently been set in array on
one of the tables in the Library, it
may not be amiss to remind book-
lovers of the importance which at
taches to this latest acquisition,
These sixty volumes comprise
Dodsley's ”Annual Register” front
the date of its appearance (1758)
to the year 1820, ajournal that
ﬁlled animportantpiace inliterary
circles during the last century,
and that counted aniongits editors
no less apcrsonage than Edmund
Burke. Its value consists not
merely in rcﬂ:cting English social-
lilc during the period of revolution
in America and France, but also
in reproducing many important
State Panels- aiid speechesin I’at‘r
Iiament. It was not until 1771
that the tight at the press to pubr
Iish reports of debates in either
l—Iouse was-recognized Meantime
journals like the “Annual Regis-
ter" recorded such proceedingsas
they dared, reporting perhaps no
more titan the supplies annually
voted by Parliament. or an oc-
casional speech delivered in the
'House of Cins'. The set was
purchased at an absurdly
ﬁgure through a Canadian book
seller. and has been presented to

the Library by the Chrestoma-
thian Society.
Very truly yours,

()n the night after a great con-
test, such as occurs today at Ward
Field, the scores ot previous
games between the rival institur
tions are decidedly interesting.
Of a total ofttvclvegames played,
Gririnell has won four and suc-
ceeded In tying one, while lowa
has carried away the lion's share
of the honors by winning seven
Exceptingthe disastrous
with Iowa's whirlwind
1900. the games have
been close and hard fought. and
can hardly warrant the assertion
of certain University press cor-
respondentsithat Grinncll
taken on as a mere "practice”
game The scores indicate that
the practice has been rather (war
sided, to say the least. The game
of '94 was not won by s U. I. but
was given to her by the referee.
While score stood 12-12 another
touchdown was scored by Scarlet
and Black. This being not allowed
our team quit the ﬁeld forfeiting
ttie victory it had already won.

In the early years, the contests
decided almost. uniformly
in iavor of Grinnell but beginning
tvttli '94. a reversal took place
and never since that time has
the old gold been trailed in the
dust, Several times victory has
hung in the balance. but Iowa
luck has invariably turned the
scales, notably in the game of
1901, when Iowa won during the
last few moments at play by
blocking a punt near the Grinneli
goal. But this yeai on our home
grounds there will be no Iowa
luck. merit alone will decide the
contest,

The Two Related Societies Enjoy a
Union Session and Farceisplendid
Time Reported.
0n last evening occurred the
ﬁrst Joint 56‘ on of tlie Cltrcsmr
mathian and Ellis societies forthe

meetings of these societies are
among the most pleasant social
events of thc year was certainly
strengthened in the mindsrof all

present last night.

The ﬁrst part at the program
was a short farce entitled——“Tell
your Wife.” All who took part in
the play did exceedingly well.
The cast of characters consisted
of Misses Low. ['Iallowa , Hut-
chinson and Lilian Smith, and
Messrs. Risscr, Hutcliins and Bar-
nard, Between the acts the audir
ence had thepleasure ot listening
to instrumental music by Misses
Riggs, Bailey, Miller and Korns,

After the ﬁnal act. of the farce,
when the letter with which so
so many had been connected had
been explained, and a happy re.
iationship was once more estab
lished between the characters of
the play, the company brolre up
and a general good time was en-
joyed by all. The time of re.
freshments came all too soon in
spite of the fact that several had
taken considerable exercise alter
the conclusion of the farce.

SENIOR PREPS ENTERTAINED.

Last evening the senior Acade
emy class was entertained at the

sented caused much merrimenti
