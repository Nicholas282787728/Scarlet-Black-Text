RE i
which reads thus:

it an old proverb
Do not
ride a free horse to death, lithe
students ofioiva College are not
in sOle need of this advice at the
present moment it will be dili‘icult
to ﬁnd a circumstance in which
to apply it. Unwlttingly. it may
be,but none the less certainly.
the people oflowa College have
bestriddcn a steed of the gratis
variety fora goodly number of
years, Take heed as tothc ﬁnan-
cial condition of the Athletic
Union and judge tor yourselt as
to whether it be not time to dis-

mount.
The debt of the Union at

the present moment is,in round
numbers. six hundred dollars. A
year ago the debt was about four
hundred and ﬁfty dollars. In oth-
er words the past year has wits
nessed the growth of the debt to
the extent of thirty-three per cent.
The thinking man will ask himself:
Who carries this load for the stu-
dents of Iowa College? \Vhoev-
.er the benefactor is, it is too much
to aslt of hirn.even though he beats
with patience the weight that is
set upon him.

The reason for this deplorable
state has often been repeated.
The students do not properly sup
port athletics, Last year nearly
every exhibition on the home
grounds netted a loss, moreover
only tony people, Including ooth
men and women, paid dues to the
Athletic Union As aresult the
year‘s athletics cost a hundred and
ﬁfty dollars than they
brought in, notwithstanding the
fact that a special subscription of
a hundred and twentyrﬁve dollars
was taken in January, Suppose

more

for a moment thatinstead oi fcnty.‘

four hundred students had jomed
the Athletic Union. The semi~
annual dues of a dollar and a half
would have paid the debt in one
semester. The Alunlnl would not
have to work on \Nal‘d Field in
their shirt sleeves because there
was no money to hire labor. The
football men might be equipped
more ﬁttingly, and we nllglltbc
able to have some more contesls
on our home grounds.

. surely we are concerned.
and deeply concerned. in the we|~
(are of the athletics of Iowa Colv
lege. Every man and every tvni
man mayjninlhe Union. Alarge
part at them will soon be inter
viewed on the subject, and
it is sincerely to be hoped that
the result at the coming canvass
willshow that this student enter
prise will not hereafter need to be
supported'by the charity oi out-
