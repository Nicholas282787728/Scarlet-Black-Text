GLEE CLUE HOME CONCERT FRI-I

DAY NIGHT.

i\'o event in the college y or,
ourstdc of the excicises of Com-
nicncenicnt week, if» gi'cetsd wiih

such universal interest as [he aii~

home concert oi the Glee
Club and Orchcsirup The Glee
Ciiib is peculiarly a student crer

niial

ntion; it has grown naturally out
of college life. of which it has
come to be recognized as ihe
typical expression. Since the
Glee Club was established nine
years ago it has grown constantly
in favor, not only in Griiinell, but
wherever it has sung, whether its
hearers were alumni of the Coir
legs or not. 115 work is not air
ways merely rollicking and boiSr
terous. but it is frequently very
musiCianly. This is a unique
feature of our Club, and it is one
which is winning its recognition
from every quarter. The mem~
bers of the Club have had ex-
ceptional advantages tor musical
training; the leaders of the Club
have not bccn changed yearly,
out in its whole history it has had
butiwo directors, both of them
musicians of ability arid experi-
ence. Under such circumstances
it is gaining such a iaiooiisiepuin
iion, and that plans are being laid
im a broad extension of its annual
iiips.

The Ampliion Orchestra has at
tiacted scarcely less interest than
the Glee Club. h is a very iin.
usual thing for an orchestra of its
size and eﬁiciency to be found
outside oi good sized cities, yet
the work which has been done is
really remarkable for its excel-
lence. The orchestra this year
contains twenty-eight members,
iiie largest number in its history.

The Grinncll Quartetteisa new
organization. but in the language
of the billboard it is an "all—star
combination," and n 't Fiiday

icgidy received in as oiii-orioiirn
