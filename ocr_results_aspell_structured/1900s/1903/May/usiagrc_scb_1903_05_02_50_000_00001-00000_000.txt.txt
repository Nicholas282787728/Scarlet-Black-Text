STUDENT LIBRARY FUND.

A Plan Proposed by which every Student
May interest Themselves in our
Ncw Library.

’llle trustees nt tlle college ill
accepring Mr. Car-negrc's cheer for
rt netv library had to guarantee to
expend not than 55.000
annually, tor the maintenance oi
the library and tor the purchase
of new books. Since the endow
illeilt fillltl is not sufﬁcient for the
purpose, the lricllds and alumni
of the institution have been asked
to donate this amount for a period
ol ﬁve years. At the expiration
ofthistime, it is expected that
the endowment lund will be large
enough so tllat the individual
pledges will no longer be lleces~
sary. Pledges have been made
up to the present titne to the
amount of 53.350 and so SL650 is
still needed to complete the
$5.000.

The student body asa whole
have not as yet done anything to-
wards showmg their loyalty and
interest ill this matter and iii
with tllls end in view that the fol
lowing plan has been suggested
by a student lil college.
The plan is. tllat every student

lllc college, academy and
school oi musicplcdgcthcrnsclucs
to give at least twenty-ﬁve Ccllt<
for ﬁve years to this

less

in

annually
id id

The low sum ot twenty-ﬁve
cents has been suggested so that
each sttldent could afford to give
at least that amount, and as much
more as they could afford. TlIC
object dcsircd I510 raise at least
side, and this can be easily done,
for taking the registration on the
low basis of 400 and at t\\‘L'nty~
ﬁve cents each, we have the $100,
but it is hoped that the amount
will be considcrably larger.

The collecting of the illllrl each
year will be in charge ni some
member of the Scarlet and Black
staiﬁsotltat as the pledges be-
come due, notices will be printed
in the Scarlct and Black and the
News Letter and llldlvitluiil
ticcs will be sent “hen ncces dry.
in order that the students as they
graduate may be reminded, and
also in tilts way the expense of
collecting will be small. A mass
meeting will probably be held
