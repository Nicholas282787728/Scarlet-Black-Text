The Phi Beta Kappa oration was
delivered by Professor James Hardy
Ropes of Harvard University. Pros
iessor Ropes has always been ind.
mately Connected with Andover, and
representing the spirit which sent
forth the Iowa 13an to found our col—
lege, it was especially ﬁtting that he
should help us celebrate the fruition
of the ideals of scholarship ‘of those
early pioneers. Protessor Ropes point—
ed out the relation between liberty

and efficiency and the opportunity to
listen to an address as polished and
scolarly is seldom given Grinnell stu-
dents.

Everl- man has vague ideas or lib-
erty, but history shows that liberty
means opposition to despotism in gays
eminent and church, What has been
the cause oi this despotism? Love of
wealth ilnd power are motives. but the
most subtile motive is the desire to he
cure efficiency. This is what makes
rulers try to force uniformity of he»
lief or of social customs on their
subjects.

Elficiency is a right principle but it
is oiten directly opposed to liberty.
Our two national parties are an exam—
ple. The Federal party and its shes
cessors, hare aimed at efficiency in
national life, even at the expense oi
individual liberty and have lowered
strong central government and a lib-
era! interpretation of the constitution.
The Democratic party on the other
hand, has held to the prluciples of
Jefferson for complete liberty and have
advocated states' rights and opposed
a strong cent izetl government. The
same clash is in other lilies. Trades
unions aim at power. This is it Drop-
or aim, but the greater the etficiency,
the greater the loss oi individual lib-
erty. '

The light or liberty is not the only
true light and indeed the "strenuous
lite” emphasized today seems to show
that efficiency as 2t guiding principle

are right and must be represented ill
the nation. Character founded in for
ligion is the bond between these t\\o
principles.

Both principles

School and church can
give us ideals, but in the practical
world. trained men with a character
brood and true, are needed to red up,
these ideals.

TIIE WENDLI G LECTURE;

A Vlilllitble Discourse on “The Man of
Galilee" Hoard by it Small
Audience.

Tuesday evening in Herrick chapelr
Geo. R. Wendling delivered the next
to the last number of the Y. M. c. A.
course to the smallest audience of the
year. The smallness of the audience
was very unfortunate as they missed
a good number.

President Main introduced the
speaker and his topic, “The Man of
Galilee," with a few appropriate re.
marks. Mr. Wendling began hls tall:
by stating that he would treat the
"blah of Galilee" in a: rational and
iudicial but not in a religious manner.
He gave a description of the man's
personality. told of his motives and
plans. His motive was a deep love
for the human race and his plan was
to found a kingdom, world»wide, ans
embracing with himself as king: and
he succeeded. Mr. Wendling then
gave a short history of the life of
Christ, He classed him as a genius
both morally and intellectually. He
took up his moral traits fully and said
that be reached absolute perfection.
In intellect none surpassed
Christ was not an invention, low as
no one but a Shakespeare could have
written Shakespeare, so could no one
but in Christ have been Chr In
concluding he said that Christ was a
king. morally. intellectually and world

him.

As it speaker, Mr. chilling did not
interest his audience as much as some
or the other speakel‘s'on the course
have. nor did be please as much as
Tait, but when he reached his cli-
milxes, he held their closest attention.
ills speech at times seemed forced,
but this in part may be attributed to
the small and unresponsive audience.
