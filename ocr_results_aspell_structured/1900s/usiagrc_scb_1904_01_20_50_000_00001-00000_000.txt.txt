MISS BEN OLIEL

Holy Land sned Light on Scripture
tnierpreiation

The people of the col'ege and
town have of tale enjoyed a rare
lpt‘tVIlegtilllal of taking an int
laginaryiourney to Palestine un-
dcr the able guidance of Miss
llien Oliel, of jerusnletn. For
three evenings she lectured, as-
sisted by students who donned
the garb of the natives and illus-
trated then customs. In this
way the lecturer explained many
obsciric scripture passages which
have long puzzled those whose
knowledge of the situation has
been less intimate, For example
Miss Belt Oliel spoke of the three
aovenants. the water-covenant,
entailing friendship and mutual
protection for forty days; the
bread~covenant, making a similar
alliance for iorty years; and most
sacred and tnvtolable of all, the
blood-covenant, establishing an
eternal l'erttnion handed down front
generation to generation. These
three co vc n a n ts were Cele»
hr-atcd between God and the Jews,
making them the people most es-
pecially ttndet His protection, the
water-Covenant, when the water
gushed ftom the smitten rock.the

Saturday evening the subject
tvds,"Vi|lage Life in Palestine,"
dealing with the and
customs uftlre Arabians now in
of Palestine, One
very important thing to ri-incmr
bet in this connection, is that the
state of civil 'ilon of th people
has remained practically as it was
two thousand years agoiwhicll
fact is a malerial aid in the inter

pretation of the scripture passages
as already ttlentloned, An inter
esting leatiire of the evening was
the celebration of the village weds

tnonial and Oriental love symr
bolism,

Monday evening was spent in
considering “City and Shepherd
Life." On this evening also, there
was a wedding ceremony, but in-
stead of the simple charm of the
village bride, it was the great day
for he. proudcr sister ot the city——
for the Arabian woman attainslier

Tuesday evening the lectrrre was
on the life of the Bedouiniideal

trated, as was also the frequent

under the auspices of the Y. W,,
C. A., and aside front being a
great success front the standpoint
ot education and pleasure, has
netted for tile association 3 sum
between forty and ﬁfty dollars,
tvlllch it is thought, will be added
to the Geneva fund.

CHRES’I‘OS SELECT DEBATERS.
Tire plan which was adopted
last year for choosing debaters
for the winter term was again fol-
A
double preliminary was held and
men

lowed last Saturday evening,

to represent the society

against the Des Moines College

and the Grinnell Institute, were

chosen. Nine men participated

in the contest and on the whole

the debate was well up to the
high standard of former Clrrcsto
preliirrinirics,

Tile question debated was the
one \\lthll will he the subject of
the Des Monies debate: “Re~
solved that labor unions are a
menace to the laboring man and
to society in general." All of
the men spoke on the negative
which side the Chresto team will
isupport in the coming joint dc-
bate.

The judges were Professor
Wyclceff, Professor Alden, Dean
Main, Mr. G. W. Cowtlen and Mr,
J- P. Lyman. Whetllltemal'kings
oftlteseﬁve gentlemen iverc aver-
aged they showed the Des Moines

Hecren, R. D. Hunting and T5.
Kisser. The team which will de»
bate the Institute consists of
Miles Collins, Chauncey Chapin
and Arthur Barnard. R. M.\iVest

expetience in high school dee
