Here is a gem ironn a recent editor
ial spasm in the Simpsonian apropos
of our recent mention at a game with
Simpson. it states Simpson‘s attitude
in the matter in a way which may he
clear to some one among our readers.
It sometimes seems uniortunate that
We haven't a puzzle page as a regular
teatnre. '
The iacts as they seem to stand
without the question oi eligihility,
which if it came to the showdown
would and Simpson sincere in not
signing them which is saying quite
a bit, do not prove that Simpson
has been mahing the ado hut rath-
er the ado has come ironi sources
ioreign to Simpson There is no
general shedding oi tears hecanse
Grinnell thought it “ill advised"
