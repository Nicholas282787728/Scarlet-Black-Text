1’) is with pleasure that we pre
sent in this issue the complete eds
itorinl staff of the SCARLET AND
BLACK. For several years there
ltas been a growing conviction that
our expanding needs necessitated
a larger editorial toree. A truly
representative college newspaper
must be in close touch with tlte
student body. and the larger the
number of active workers the bet-
ter tlte support and err-operation
obtained. This infusion of new
material will also give a ireslrness
and variety to the columns of the
paper which could not be secured
from the unaided eHorts of two 0|
tliiee overworked editors. Then
again, it is evident that collegeliie
is too short and the demands made
upon the time of the average Stu—
dent are too pressing to make it
wise or practical to devote oue’s
energies entirely to a slngle activ-
ity. The editors, while tltey ex-
pect and are willing to bear the
burden of responsibility, ought
not to be compelled to endure the
excessive strain of double news-
paper ditty. But more important
than these considerations is the
fact that by this method a larger
opportunity is Offered to the stu-
dentsforjournalistic work. Facile
ity and accuracy of style are two
of the essential requisites of a suc-
cessful writer. and these are most
readily obtained through constant
practice in writing for the press.

With these ends in view. the pres» g

ent management. at the beginning

of candidates a chance to sholv
their capability. A fair ﬁeld and
no favors has been our invariable
policy, and all selections have
been made on merit alone. Ala:-

fully considered, with the result
that we believe we now have an

orators. Vacancies are liable to‘
occur at any time, and it will be
our nnalterable rule to make nced-
ed selections justly and impartial-
ly from the most promising candi-
dales. and thus keep the staff up-
on a high plane or proﬁciency.
From the new members of the
staff we expect faithful service,
and in return we bespeak forthem
the interest and appreciation of
both the management and the stu
dent body

Fort THE ﬁrst time in two years
Drake and Grinnell meet once
more upon the gridiron The dtt.
ﬁculties lying at the bottom of last
year's athletic rupture have been
removed and the football manage
ments of the state teams have
come to a pertect understanding.
lowa athletics have been put upon
a lligllcl- plane—a plant where
morals as well as athletic ability is
given due weight, The larger in.
stitutions have taken the lead and
the smaller schools are talling into

competition between clean. square
representatives or the various crtl
leges of the state.

In the iecent trouble between
Drake and Grinnell. both parties.
perhaps. were at tault. though tor
different reasons. One acknowlr
edged her' violation of the Rules
and Regulations for the control of
Intercollegiate Contests; the 0th
er was guilty at very indisereet
and hasty action. The managers
ot both teams have met halt-way
and have done all in their power
to set affairs right. The matter
now rests with the athletes them~
selves, and next Friday night's
contest will be something ofa test
for the participants of the game.
Not only is a clean athletic record
to be desired, but a cleanly played

ame also, based upon science and
skill and free from all elements of
the prizeering. Such a game is a
pleasure to both players and spec
tators. This is a high standard of
excellence, to be sure, but not too
high. The DrakerGrinnell game
is the ﬁrst big game on the schedr
ules oi the two respective schools.
and it is hoped above all things
that the two schools will start the
season right.
