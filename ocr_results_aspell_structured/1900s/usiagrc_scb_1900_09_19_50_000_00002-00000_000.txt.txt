Qﬁbitnrial

UPON THE front page will be n0~
ticed an account of the debating
compact. entered into by Knox,
Beloit, Cornell and Grinnell. This
step was taken last spring, and in-
troduces a new system of inter-cob
legiate debating. By this scheme
more colleges and more debaters
will meet every year, more care-
ful and systematic preparation
will be necessary. and greater
honor will be won or lost. A
wider ﬁeld is offered to debat-
ers. This fact should act as a
great incentive to our home der
baring circles. our societies
should take a newstart, More de-
bates, more debaters, more thor-
oughness in preparation. more en-
ergy from the ﬂoor. more enthu-
Slasm from the chair—these are
the elements needed to make our
society debates a success, Now
is the time to begin, and especially
is this true of the new Studentl
Debaters are made but slowly.
Command of language. logical ac-
ouracy, and cool-headedness come
only with experience. Let the
present freshman join a literary
society now; let him acquire the
weapons of the debater thro' the
ﬁrst two or three years of his col-
lege career by constant practice;
and when he reaches the status of
a junior or senior. he will be equipv
pcd and ready to go forth as Grin-
nell’s representative, to meet rir
val debating teams from rival col-
leges. it is the earnest wish of all
interested in debating affairs that
Grinnell make a good showing in
the coming inter-collegiate de-
bates. ltis netnecessarytopoint
out how this is to be doneithe
word“work"isalwaysinextricably
interwoven with anything worth
striving after. T he particular
point to be emphasized just at
present is that every freshman
will some day be a senior, and as
such will, generally‘speaking, be
responsible for the honor of the
'college. Just how he hears that
responsibility will depend upon
the foundation he builder] in his
freshman year. The word to the
freshman, then, is to begin debat—
ing now, and when the timecomes
be ready to ﬁll the vacancies in
our debating teams always made
vacant at the end of the year by
the graduating classes,

Geo. A. SHURTLEFF.,Knox.
I. B. DAVIES, Beloit.

A. D, DAVIS, Iowa.

This compact should be adopted
by the local leagues, copies of the
same should be signed and ex-
changed.

The committee voted to recom-
mend to their several leagues the
purchase of a banner to go with
the championship.

The committee was unable to
decide where the next debates
should be held in case the two
winning teams should be the two
home teams and the two losing
teams the visiting ones.

1 recommend to our league in
such a case, the ﬁrst time it be
decided by lot and every time
thereafter that this occurs the de-
bate should go to the school not
last having such debate.

A. D. Davrs, Com.

This compact and the accom—
panying recommendations of our
delegate will soon come up before
the Iowa College Debating Union
for ﬁnal action. Much time and
careful thought has been given to
this subject and it only remains

 

to perfect a few minor details of
the organization.
