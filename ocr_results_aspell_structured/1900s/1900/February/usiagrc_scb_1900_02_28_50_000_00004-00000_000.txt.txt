The program or last Saturday's
meeting of the Clliestomathian
society was opened by a paper by
Mr. I-Iamlin, who chose Ior his
subject“Tlle life ofRuskin.” Very
little of the paper was given to
Rtlslcin's home life; but it collsistr
ed mostly of a review of what he
had contributed ti: the world as a
literary genius, and his inﬂuence
upon literature. The paper, al
though rather short, was \\‘Cll write
ten and showed thorough prcpar
ration and thought.

The second number was a select
reading by Mr. Mouso. This was
Mr. Muuso’s First appearance up.
on the floor; but he impressed his
audience very favorably, both in
his case upon the ﬂoor and ill his
style of reading. He chose Ior
his subject “A Man Without a
Country." His subject was well
chosen and was interesting.

The third number was a speech
by Mr. Meade. Mr. Meatte is an
old member of the society and
his speeches are always interest-
ing.

Next was the extemporancous
work. The ﬁrst speaker was Mr.
Arnold, who spoke on the Oratorr
ical contest. He thoughtthe cons
test was the equal, if not the su-
perior, of the average yearly eon.
test, Although there was no star
speaker, the average was better
than usual at contests. The com
test was very strong in oratory,
showing a thorough training oi
nearly all the speakers.

Mr. Denison spoke upon “The
Tamer of the British Lion." Mr.
Denison is a new member and
shows that he is capable of excel-
lent work. His speech was very
interesting. He noted the fact
that the British lion is now learn~
ing a few lessons. It is accuse

 

tonicd to being obeyed; but is
now mcctinga toe which seems
to be its equal,

Mr, Mollei‘spoke next on ”How
lowa College impressed our visit-
ors.” Thenewgymnasiumsecmcd
to be the center of attraction.
Also the equipment of our labor-
atories was of interest. On the
whole, our college seemed to
impress itsclt upon the minds or
other college men as being an up-
to»date school. The debate was
rather short, there being no vol-
unteers. The question was, “Re-
solved, that the house of l'cprc-
sentativcs in the Roberts case was
justiﬁable." The atnrtnatwe was
supported by O. Risser; the neg
ative by Owen. Mr. McKeag
acted as judge and summed up
the debate. The decision was
given in tavor or the afﬁrmative.

The lack of music was the one
tault or the program. but the in
clemency ot the weather in a
large measure accounted tor this
deﬁciency. On the whole, the
program was very good. in spite
of the (rigid atmosphere ot the
hall. ‘

Music-Literary

The society Monday evening
was unusually interesting. as both
Frot.Cole and Mr. Emery took
part.

Owing to the absence of the
ﬁrst paper, Prof. Cole gave a
sketch of the life of Liszt, dividing
it into three periodsiprodigy,
virtuoso and composer,

Mr. Emery gave a well pre»
pared paper on the compositions
of Liszt, dividing them into (our
classesiinstrumental, orchestral,
sacred&songs. Liszt is undoubt.
edly the ﬁnest pianist that has ex-
isted. No pianist has ever been
able to attain the technic of
which he was master.
