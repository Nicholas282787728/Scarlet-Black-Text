This furnishes a most llltel’cillng

fact well known to all. The foot»
ball season is over and the work in
athletics for this fall is at an end.
Other interests now demand our
attention and these demands
should be heeded. Just as much
enthusiasm should be put into the
work of this winter, as was shown
on the athletic ﬁeld this fall. But
in the rush to get the ragged ends

This concert is not given, to he
