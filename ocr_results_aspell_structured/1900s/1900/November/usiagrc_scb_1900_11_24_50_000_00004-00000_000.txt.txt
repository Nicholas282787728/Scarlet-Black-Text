The Second Team Again.

As has been stated before the
second team have played in rathcr
hard luck this Season. Two ims
portant dates were cancelled.
leaving only one home game
and no trips. While the manage—
ment could in no way control the
Causes effecting those dates, the
work of the second team was
deemed worthy of still further
reward. With this solely in View
the entire second team was taken
to Iowa City last Saturday. The
same thing will be repeated next
Thursday. All the ’Varsity, 'Var-
sity substitutes and all the second
team will be taken to Des Moines,

For another feature of the ow
tertainment, which will be offered
the football squad in Des Moines,
the men can'thank that cnthusi
astic friend or Grinnell sports,
Charles Rawson. Afterthe game
a banquet will be served. and after
the banquet w. P. Chase, owner
of the football grounds. will ens
terrain both the Grinnell and
Drake tootball aggregations at
the Auditorium, Boxes have
been reserved on each side,7one
side for Drake, another for Grin-
nell. Following the custom or
eastern schools, it will be a strict
Iy “football evening.” Charles
Rawson is the prime mover of
these good things and he should

the team,
Coach Harris was overheard to
remark that a better spirit and a

more regular, steady play was
never put up by an Iowa College
second team than by the present
one. This is why the “scrubs"
receive so much attention.

$l.50 Round Trip to Des Moines.

Peculiar arrangements have
bccn made to get football enthu-
siasts to Des Moines Thanksgivs
ing Day. The route will be via
the Iowa Central and Northwest-

 

ern. The time each way will be
as follows: leave Griimell at 8:10
Thursday morning, arrive at Dcs
Moincs rl:5o, close connections
made clear through. Leave Dcs
Moincs either Friday or Saturday
morning at 7:00 and arrive in
Grninell at lozt7; or if pleferrcd
the night trip can be taken, als
though the time arrangements are
not as good. The tickets will
cost Sl.so, and are good until
Saturday, Dec. 1.

The management was not at all
satisﬁed with the propositions of
the Rock Island for this trip.
Considering the rates given to
Draltc for her Iowa City game,
and also that the Rock Island not
only quoted a higher rate than
the one mentioned above, but de»
manded a guarantec of a hundred
people and would only limit the
tickets to Friday, the manage-
ment concluded tolook elsewhere.
The Iowa Central has favored
Grinnell in every possible way
and it is urged that all students
going to Des Moines support the
management in this move.

Drake and Grinnell are very
nearly on a par. The game will
be a close one. Good seats WlII
be provided for all spectators.
Thegrounds have been Covered
with straw, which will be raked
off just bctore the game. leaving
them in excellent Condition. A
large delegation is asked to turn
out to our last game.

A subscription paper will be
left at Alley's Drug Store, which
all. intcnding to sec the game. are
requcsted to sign,

NAT P. ELLls, Mgr,

There are no big games sched-
uled in the west todayiall the
teams ale lying low for the games
on Thanksgivmg Day. On that
datc Chicago and Michigan will
ﬁght hard to see which shall stay
at the bottom of the list; Iowa
and Northwestern will scrap it out
at Rock Island; \\7isconsin and
Illinois meet for their annual con»
test; and Minnesota meets NebrasA
