Q‘Bbitoriul

IN A Frtltrmvm' land, where peas
ple have strange ways and look
askance :lt customs much difr
fer-ant from ours, there was once
a nice little college in a nice little
town. This little college had al—
wayspridcditselfonit'sreputation
of living in a pure, clean atmos»
phere, and of preserving a Compare
atively high standard of morality,
which, so tradition said, had been
maintained since the beginning of
it's history, But one day there
wasa football game, A team from
a neighboring institution came
over to this little college and
played to: the championship. It
had been the custom of these
teams to have at least one game
during a season for sevcral years.
So, to repeat. this neighboring
team came ov‘er to play football in
that far away land where people
have strange ways. The game
was very much onersided (though
forthat the neighboring team was
in no way to blame), and the home
team had small trouble in winning
a decided Victory. But, during
the progress of the game and as
the ﬁnal result became more cer—
tain, the visitors on the gridiron
and along the side lines grew ir-
ritated and, being further offended
by sundry ﬂagrant violations of
scientific footballLin their own
team, gave vent to their feelings in
language loud and strong. It was
said they sworeiand awfully, too
—oaths which were plainly heard
trom the grandstand. This hurt
the feelings of the little college.
The little college rather thought
that, out of respect to the ladies
present, such language ought
not to be used, But. Oh
no! not in that faraway land
lvhere people have strange. Oh

such strange ways. Surely the
little college has ideals too high;
if it could see games in our own
land. where loud swearing is often
a feature, it would adopt more
liberal standards. But then this
all took place in a land far, tar
away.

Oratorical Contest.

For the beneﬁt of the new Stlk
dentsa word in explanation or
the Annual Oratorical Contest
may not be a mLss. The contest
will propably be held Monday
December l7th. Six contestants

the faculty, tlle decision being
made on the merits of the oration
submitted The manuscripts

Secretary of the Oratorical Asso
ciation on or before Wednesday
Nov.22, Manuscripts need not
be typewritten until passed upon
by the committee, The decision
of the committee will he announc-
ed without delay. Three types
written copies of each of the six
succcessful orations must be ‘ill
the hands of the secretary by
Monday Nov. 27th. The malkr
ings by the judges on the thought
and composition of the orations
are kept ’by the secretary in a
sealed envelope until after the
contest has taken place, when the
envelopes are opcncd and the
rankings of each competitor in
thought and composition is
ascertained. By adding the
ranking on thought and compo
sition to the ranking in delivery.
the ﬁnal rank is obtained. The
contestant receiving ﬁrst rank will

in cash; the second in rank will be

ber may avail themselves of this
opportunity and that the contest

may be the best that has hcen held
for many years.
