'STATE MEET.
S. U. l. WlNSiGRlNNELL
SECOND.

The Eleventh Annual Field Meet of
the Iowa Intercollegiate Athletic Asso
ciation was held yesterday at the state
fair grounds at Des Moines. It was
without dorrbt the most successful
meet in the history of the Association.
The day was perfect, the track in ﬁne
condition and the attendance all that
could be desired, about 3000 being
present. The two big grandestands
were full to overrﬂowing, while the
space within the track was crowded
with carriages. The band of the State
University occupied ilre judges’ stand
and furnished ﬁne music.

The meet opened propitiously for
Grinnell. When the men lined up for
the too-yard dash, it was seen that
Fuller of U. l. U. was not to compete,
and Peck, of Ames, was considered to

be the strongest claimant for ﬁrst iron-

ors as against Grinnell. At the crack
of the pistol Bair jumped to the front,
with Snider close behind. Morton, 01'
S. U. l.,displayed unexpected sprint-
ing qualities on a fast track, but was
not quite fast enough to overtake the
two leaders. Snider passed Bair just
at the tape and the two Maltese crosses
crossed the line in the lead, Strider first
Bair second, and Morton third. Time,
10 3-5,

in the shot-put Grinrrell had no
chance of winning and her men were
soon thrown out. Warner, of the
State University won, with Brriiker,
l. S. C., second and Buriier, S. U. L,
third. Distance, 37 feet, 4% inches.

A fast ﬁeld of riders appeared for
the % mile bicycle race, and the race
was ridden hard from start to ﬁnish,
with no loaﬁiig anywhere. Bansch~
baugh, of S. U. l.,displayed the same
sprinting qualities which he showed in
the dual meet at Grimiell, and won by
a good margin iii the spurt down the
stretch, Bone, I. S. C., and Wheat, of
Cornell securing second and third res-
pectively. Time, 1 minute and 9
seconds.

Grinnell was again in evidence in
the, 2207yard dash, although Morton,
of S. U. L, again showed unexpected
strength. Srrider won handily in 23
2-5, pulling Lyman alter him into
third place, Morton taking second,

Tire % mile rrrn furnished one of
the most exciting races of the day.
Wyant, of l. S. N,, set a hot pace at

 

the start, and just as the bunch was
beginning to string out in pursuit,
Brown, of S. U. l., tripped and fell.
He had lost several yards when he re
gained his feet again, aird all supposed
that he was out of the race, brrt he
plrrckily kept on, passed his men one
by one, overtook ihe exhausted Wy-
ant on the stretch and won out in 2
minutes,5 15 seconds. anrdmarr,
S. U. l., took second, and Dwigans,
I. S. C., third.

The broad jump went at a low
ﬁgure, being won by Palmer, or I. S.
C., with a jump of 20 feet, 7% inches,
with Williams, S. U. I., second and,
Sellards,'Drake, third.

Lowe, of Drake, McBirney, of l, S.
C., and Brockway, S. U 1., took the
hammer-throw in the order named.
Distance, 109 feet, [1% inches.

Lamb and Palmer of l. S. C. had
both been heralded as probable win-
ner's of the 120 yard hurdles, but
neither were very much in evidence
when the ﬁnal test came, as both
Crouch of Grirruell and Howell of
S. U, I. ﬁnished ahead of them in the
order named. Palmer was a close
third. Time 163-5 seconds, within
irS of a second of the state record
made by Fisher of Grinnell last year.

In the 440 yard dash, Griirnell eiir
tered only Risser, saving Lyman tor
the relay. Brown of S. U. I. added
5 points to the rapidly growing total
of his school by winning ﬁrst, Kies
of Drake won second, while Cornell
proved her presence at the meet by
depositing Cropp in the third position.
Time 52 2-5.

The discus throw brought joy to
the hearts of the rooters for “old
D. U.,” whose faces had for some time
worn expressions as blue as their rrni-
forms. Drake won ﬁrst and third,
through the efforts of Smith arid Boer
gess, while Hull of S. U. I. took sec
ond. Distance, 104 feet, 5 inches.

In the 2207yard hurdles Crouch took
revenge for his defeat at the Dual
Meet aird \voir from Howell after a
hard struggle. Lamb and Palmer
again failed to materialize as danger»
nus enemies, although Lamb was third,
some distance away. Time, 27 15
seconds.

Emerson, of Drake, set the pace in
the mile run and held it to the three
quarter pole, where suddenly Wilson
of l. S. C. set sail for home.
Brown of S. U. l. and Bacon of Drake
started after him, but the Ames man
was too strong and ﬁnished a good

 

Irrst, followed by the others in the
order named.
43 seconds. .

Rayner of Cornell gave his college
a big lift toward securing its required
number of points by winning ﬁrst iii
the hop-step».\nd-jrririp, covering a
drstairce of 44 feet, 4% inches, Mer-
edith of Point was second arid Graham
of Drake, third.

The z-nrile bicycle was appropriat-
ed largely by S. U. 1. After Wcrirli
and Meredith had set the pace the
greater part of the distance, Choate of
S. U. l. forged ahead and won, with
Bone of I. S. C. second and Bansch-
baugh of S. U. 1. third. Time, 5
minutes, it 275 seconds.

The result of the relay was a disap-
pointment to Orinnell. Bair, the first
man, was given a hard man to ruir
against in Morton of S. U, I, and an
unlucky stumble gave his rival a lead
which could not be overcome. Delar
van, Lyman and Strider all gained on
their opponents, and Howell, running
the last stage for S. U. l., ﬁnished by
a slight margin ahead of Snider, who
again had only a short lead over I. S.
C,’s representative. Time, 1 minute,
36 seconds.

The polervault was protracted (lure
ing the greater part of the afternoon,
owing to the tact that the state record
was equalled, or beaten by four men,
Eugelke, of Gririnell, Chapman, of
Drake, and Brackett and Weilaiid, of
S. U. l., l’ell, of Drake, having retired
at the modest height of 9 feet. Brackr
ett and Bailey dropped out at to feet
2 inches. Engelke and Chapman
both cleaned 10-6, but failed at 10-8.
When the tie was vaulted oft, Chap-
man won ﬁrst, although he and
Engelke both received credit for the
record. Blackett, of S. U. 1., took
third. Record height, lOfeetGinclres;
winning height, to feet 3 inches,

The high jump, the last event of
the day, was begun immediately after
the conclusion ol the pole-vault and
resulted iii a victory for White, of
Penn, willi Kcttlcwell, of S. U. |.,
second, l’almer, of |. S. C., third.
Height, 5 feet and 8 inches.

The ﬁnal summary of points gives
the State University ﬁrst, with 51
points; Grinnell second, with 27;
Ames third, with 2}, and Drake
fourth, with 21. Penn and Cornell
both won 7 points, strtlicicnt to retain
their membership in the Association.
