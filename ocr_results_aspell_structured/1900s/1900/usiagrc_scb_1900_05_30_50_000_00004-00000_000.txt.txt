be a decided disappointment, and
to many who are not students of

dramatic tendencies, it may seem
rather Hat and uninteresting. The

The last regular meeting of the
society {or this year was rather
poorly attended, owing, presum-
ably to the hot weather and the
State Meet The quality or the
program was, on the whole. up to
the standard and was interesting
throughout, The meeting was
called to order promptly at 8
o'clock by President Quaile. The
opening number of the program
was an oration by Mr, Wharton,
which showed enretul preparation
and was well delivered.

Mr. Fletcher Meade then read
a parody on the “Man with the
Hoe" entitled "The Sophomore
with the Freshman Baby," which
was well received by the society,

Mr. McKeag's speech on “Rur-
al Mail Delivery” was interesting
and instructive and showed cares

ftrl preparation, The extempos
lanenns \\'Oll( was as follows: Mr.
ANIOItI spoke on the "Inﬂuence of
Science on Theology"; Mi. Den-
nison on the “Mothers' Congress";
Mr. McKeag on the “State Meet”
and Mt‘. Crabb ml “The Boer
Peace Envoys.”

The society was then favored
with a whistling solo by Miss
Brown, who never fails ill delight
mg her listeners. Slle kindly rc-
sponded to an encore.

The debate tor the evening was
unusually spirited nntl interesting.
Henry George's proposed land
reiorm. known as the "Single Land
Tax," was discussed, J, A. Meade
favoring and Mr. Grier opposing.
The afﬁrmative maintained that
the present system oi taxation is
unscientiﬁc and the cause of many
political and social ills; that the
single land tax being merely the
appropriation by the state of purc-
ly social values, is the only abso.
lutely just tax; that it corresponds
to llle classical maximsoltaxation
laid down by Adam Smith and
would work a great ﬁscal reiorm.
The negative maintained thatoth-
er things besides land have an
”unearned increment" which
should be taxed, and attempted
to prove by statisticsthateconom-
ic rent alone, it all appropriated,
would not yield sufﬁcient revenue.
At the request at both speakers
there were no judges or decision.
