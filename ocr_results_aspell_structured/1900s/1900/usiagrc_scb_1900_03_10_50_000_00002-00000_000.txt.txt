THE snaps taken a few days ago.
looking toward the organization of
a college basket—ball team. and the
choice of Mr. H. H. Douglass, 'ol.
as its captain, meets with the
hearriest approval of the students.
While it will be a matter of Con-
siderable diFﬁculty to get a team
together in the short time remain—
ing betcrethcgarneat Des Moines,
on the sixteenth, ive feel sure that
Grinnell will make at least a credr
itable showing against their more
experienced opponents.

IT is \VITH much regret that we
are called upon to chronicle the
death of Trustee Charles W. Rand
of Burlington. which occurred last
Tuesday evening. At the time of
his death he was at Los Angeles.
Calif., having gone there at the
beginning of the year to beneﬁt
his health, Mr. Rand has been a
member of the board of trustees
of Iowa College tor only three
years, but during that time he
has made many friends in Gl’ln'
nell through his occasional visits
to the city. His death is espe-
cially sad at this time as his
mother. brother and sister are all
abroad making a tour or the Old
World.

Gymnasium Exhibition.

Arter some difﬁculty, Friday
evening, March 3o, has been ﬁxed
as the date of the exhibition of
the work in the men’s gymnasium.
Prof. Davis already has an attrac-
tive program under way. On this
occasion will be played the ﬁnals
in the series of basket ball games
now in progress, and class races,
either potato races or club races,
will be organized. There will also
be apparatus work on the llorie
zontal bar, the horse and the par
allel bars, together with pyramlds
and specialties which will be an-
nounced later. Good music will
be provided.

All men intending to take part

in the exhibition ale urged to be-
gin practice at once on the pieces
oi apparatus designated. In an
exhibition such as this, ability to
a feat does not count [or so much
as ability to perform it well. It
is the form of an athlete's work
which determines his work lo a
gymnasium, and form can only
be attained by diligent practice.
The success of the exhibition tle~
pends on the amount of time
which is put into preliminary
work, and it is to be hoped that
this may not be neglected:
Redpath Grand Concert C0.
Unqiiestionably the ﬁnest con-
cert of the year, trom a musical
point of view, will be the one given
next Friday evening by the Red
path Grand Concert company.
The quartetofvocalistsis one such
as can be heald only in our great-
er musical rcstival or orntorio per.
formances. Indeed, it would be
difﬁcult to choose a more repre-
sentalive quartet of American
singers. Marlall Titus made her
debut only three years ago, will
the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
yet has ivon a place as a soprano
singer of exccptionablc abiliiy be-
side her more famous associates.
It is hard to speak oi Mary Louise
Clary without using extravagant
superlatives, which seem entirely
proper in her case, rur she is just
ly regarded as the greatest cone
tralto since the days of Annie
Louise Cary. Mr. Towne, who
possesses a high, clear, ringing
tenor voice of great dramatic pow-
er, and Mr. Carl Dth, one of our
best Oratorio basses. have repeat-
edly sung with the largest orches-
tras and Oratorio societies of this
country and Canada. lVllSs Helen
von Fursch, violinist. and Miss
Georgia Kober, pianlst. are both

spoken of very enthusiastically
and will undoubtedly add greatly
to the interest of the program. As
a whole, the company is certainly
the strongest that has been here
for many years, and will ﬁnd a
hearty welcome with the large
audience that will greet it.
