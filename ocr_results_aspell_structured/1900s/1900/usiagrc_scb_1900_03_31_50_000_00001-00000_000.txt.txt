Gymnasium Exhibition.

The gymnasium exhibition given
last night in the men’s gymnasium
was a success. looked at from
every standpoint. Considering
the fact that it was the ﬁrst time
anything in that line had been at
tempted, Mr. Davis and those who
assisted in working it up, are to be
especially congratulated. The
events were run off at a good rate
and there was no tiresome waiting
between them.

The ﬁrst event on the program
was an interrelass club race, which
was won by Gray, ’06, Findlay,
'04. second.

The work on the horse and par-
allel bars was done by Snider,
Parks. Williams and Chase, and
on both pieces of apparatus some
excellent form was shown.

On the horizontal bars were
Engelke, Thompson, Clark, Fisk,
Parks, Meredith, Walleser and
McCord. After some class work
by these men Engelke.Thomp-
son and Clarke did some very
good individual work.

Following this came the ﬁrst
half of the basket ball game be
tween the Sophomores and June
iors, and at the end of half honors
were even, the sophs having two
goals and one foul, while the Jun-
iors had three fouls and one goal
to their credit.

Although but little was attempt-
ed in the line of pyramid building
it was well done and proved to be
an interesting part of the program.
The tumbling was one of the best
features of the evening's program
and was done by Ross, Fisk, Walls

 

eser, Meredith. Findlay and Mcr
Cord. Findlay furnishing no little
amusement dressed as a clown.

Following this came the second
half of the basket ball game, and
it was the fastest exhibition of
basketball ever witnessed in Iowa
College. the sophomores secure
ing two goals and the juniors tour,
making the ﬁnal score 139 in the
juniors' favor.

The next number on the pros
gram was some very good torch
swinging by Mr, Mitchell. This
concluded the program of the ﬁrst
annualgymnasium exhibition. and
judging trom the standard set, it
is to be hoped that the good prec»
edent will be followed in future

years.

Grlnnell lnstltute.

The regular literary part of the
program was dispensed with at
the last meeting of Grinnell In—
stitute and the time was devoted
wholly to committee reports, elec-
tion of oﬁicers for the ensuing
term and such other business mats
ters as should receive attention
preparatory to closing the winter
term.

On the whole, the society can
not but be pleased with its record
during the past three months. A
new constitution has been suc-
cessfully launched upon its way.
and is satisfactorily meeting the
deﬁciencies in the old constitution
which have been so often com-
plained of during the past year or
more. The present membership
is the largest in years. The ofﬁc-
ers have endeavored to perform
their work with accuracy and cons
scienciousness, and the individual
members have, in the main, res
sponded cheerfully and ably when
placed upon tlle programs. The
treasurer is able to close his books
with a surplus, despite the fact.
that the Institute has donated 565
for additions to the library, com-
pletely renovated the piano, and
voted 535 to meet expenses of the
recent play. Outside attractions
have been unusually numerous
during the term, yet the attend-
ance, on the whole, is worthy of
commendation.

The most hotly contested off-ice
for the following term was that of
the presidency. From a large
number of candidates, Lindsay

succeeded to the sccretaryship
with small opposition. H. G. Lye
man was appointed treasurer for
the entire ﬁscal year, extending
from the present to the cones
pending time next spring. Ellis
was appointed chaplain; aneike,
sergeant-at-arms; and Waterman,
committee on music.

The old old custom of retreats
ing to the Met was not observed,
and the newly elected ot‘ﬁcials
were allowed to retire unscathed.

Calocagathla and Ellis.

The Calocagathian and Ellis sor
cieties united Friday afternoon in
a program on Wagner and Wag
nerian opera. The meeting was
held in Ellis Hall and presided
over by the Calocagathian press
ident, MissJane Fulton.

Miss Retta Swan gave a sketch
of Wagner's life. his boyhood, ed—
ucation and ambitions. Follow-
ing this came a piano and violin
duet, the Wedding March from
Lohengrin. played by Misses
Edna Proctor and Laura Rew.
An outline of the Nibelungenlied
wasgiven by Miss Inez Woodford,
telling the mythological story
which forms the basis of the great
tetralogy of operas.

A selection from Wagner’s
opera, the "Meistersinger”, was
played by Miss Hill and Miss
Rew. aftera few words by Prof.
Cole in explanation of its theme
andstory.

The last and main feature of the
program was a talk by Prof. Cole
on “Wagner's Art Theories."
He said that Wagner and his
theories divided the musical world
into two hostile factions, between
whom a bitter contest was waged.
The cause of this was his genius
of originality, expressing itself in
artistic truth. Wagner claimed
that true art is not stimulated by
fashion or princely patronage.
The basis of true art is democratic
and popularand must spring from
a national impulse. The opera
should combine the beauties of
poetry, music. dance and all the
other arts.

The opera of Wagner‘s time was
vocalization centered about the
