Home Concert.

The sixth annual concert of the
Glee Club and Orchestra took
place at the stone church last eve
ening. The usual pride and in
teresi of both citizens and students
were shown by the large and en-
thusiastic audience. The church

was handsomely decorated with a
liberal display ofscarlet and black
and in addition the predominance

of evening toilets, especially in
the galleries, marked the event as
one of the festive occasions of the
yeah

Both organizations maintained
the high standard they had set in
the past. or rather showed the use
ual improvements, for it has be
come a matter of course for us to
expect and to realize a more ﬁne
ished production each year, and
this in spite of the necessary
change of personnele—all of which
speaks volumes for Prof, coleand
his accomplishments as a director.

One of the pleasing features is
the care shown in the selection of
numbers and their arrangement
on the program. The playing ot
the orchestra was pleasing
throughout. The orchestral por»
tion, selected from such standard
composers as Gounod, Ambroise
Thomas. Flotow and Suppé, was
artistically rendered. and was so
pleasing to the audience that an
encore was demanded and re-
ceived on nearly every number
The dainty gavottcirom"Mignon"
was a charming hit, charmingly
rendered and should certainly
have been repeated. Suppé'sovcr»
ture and the selections from “Mar-
the," were given with clash and
spirit, and proved to be excellent
numbers with which to close the
two parts.

The Glee Club sang exception
ally well. In the Peasant’s Weds
ding March, which is replete with

 

beautiful melodies, they showed
careful training, and their voices
blended well, something very nec-
essary in that ﬁnely shaded piece.
Theotherseriousnumbers,Vogel's
Waltz Song and “Though Day
Asleep is Falling,” by Kuntze,
proved very attractive, too. The
latter is especially telling for
men’s voices, and received a sym»
pathetic rendition. Its ﬁne har-
monies gratitying to the
musical ear, The vocal work of
the lighter order was very accept-
able. The most prominent thing
on the program, and certainly the
number which aroused the great
est curiosity. was the act from the
Up-to-Date Grand Opera, In which
the soloists were Mr. Parish, Mr.
Macartney and Mr. Cartwright,
They acted and sung with great
fervor, and sent a chill of realism
down the backs of the opera lov—
ers. As an echo ot Italian opera,
it must certainly share the lanrels
with the Scalchi Company. Mr.
Macartney in a flowing, graeetul
robe, made a sweet prima donna,
and was able to sing the exacting
ﬂorid music of the part with great
precision.

The numerous encores were
largely given over to local hits, in
which the janitor and the presir
dential bull terrier received a
large share of attention. Not the
least attractive feature was the
appearance or Mr,W.S. Peirce,
‘99, our former popular yodeler.
who, with Mr. Parish as soloist.
appeared in his specialty tor one
of the encores.

Calocagarhla.

The Friday atternoon program
at Calocagatliia was one at the
best and most enjoyable which
that society has held tor some
time. The improved condition
of the piano and the several mus-
ical numbers assisted largely to
this end. Miss Alchibald of
Chicago, who is doing the train~
ing for the Institute-Calocagathia
play, kindly consented to read
for the society and gave four
short selections. These were of
different style and brought out
the talent and ability of the read-
er. The ﬁrst was Mrs. Brown-
ing's 'My Kate,” and this was
followed by Field's “Bow-legged
Boy.” Kipling’s “Tommy," and

were

Riley’s “Eatin'On the Porch.”
Miss Archibald's rendition was
sympathetic and true and her
reading was a rare treat. The
rest of the program was an opera.
Miss Christine Kendrick gave a
sketch of "Lohengrin," the cii‘r
cumstances of its composition
and the story ot the opera. This
was followed by several selections
trom the opera, played by Miss
Clara Millerd. Miss Millerd's
music is always a great pleasure,
and coming thus after the story
of the opera made it doubly ap-
preciated, “Il Trovaiore” was
the subject of a talk by Miss
Vesta Hinkley, and after this the
“Anvil Chorus" from this opera
was given as a piano duct by
Misses Helen Thomson and Mabel
Wetmore. This chorus is always
inspiring and on this occasion lost
none at its beauty.

Mrs, Vittum very beautifully
sang a song from “11 Trovatore."
This ﬁnished the program of the
afternoon, but the society and the
large number or visitors who were
present, stayed to enjoy a social
time together, and some light re—
freshments. Next Friday there
will be a debate.

Basket Ball.

The third game of the intern
class basket ball series was played
on yesterday between the teams
representing the Junior and
Freshman classes. The ﬁnal
score was 14 to 6 in favor of
'or. In the ﬁrst part of the game
the Juniors had things all their
own way. but toward the last the
Freshmen rallied and were play-
ing strongly when time was
called. The Juniors excelled in
team work throughout, Doe and
Douglass throwing some very
clever baskets. wlllle Fellows
played a strong game at back.
The Freshmen played hard, but
lost many chances to score by
attempting almost impossible
throws. Both sides fouled free
quently, and Fellows tor'oi and
Evans for '03 both did good work
in throwing baskets trorn fouls.
