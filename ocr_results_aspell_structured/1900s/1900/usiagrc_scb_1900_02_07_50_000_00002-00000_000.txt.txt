NEXT FRIDA afternoon there
will be a meeting of the track meii.
We do not neetl to urge the old
tiaclt men to be present. but we
would like to impress upon the
new men the importance of their
attending this meeting. Ourpros-
pects on the track this year are
anything but bright, and our
chances ior victory must rest on
a “green" team. For this rea-
son, prospects of making the team
are bright tor the new men who
ivill get out and work. Those who
will do this will have all the atl»
vantages which can be obtained
anywhert to help them in their
training. We have a ﬁne gymna.
sium, with a capable director. and
we are to have a tlainer, who is a
recognized master in his depart
ment. Thismeetingwiilgivenew
men a chan‘ce to choose what
events they preler to try for, as
well as to get some advice ln‘re-
gard to winter training, There
are many oltl men in school who
have never been out on the track,
who could do no better than to
attend this meeting and signify
their intention oi training. such
action on their part will be both
an incentive to new men and a
beneﬁt to themselves.

IN THE last issue of SCARLET AND
BLACK appeared a statement rela»
tive to the preliminaty contest for
the Hyde Prize, to which we de-
sire to call the attention otall stu-
dcnts who. as membersof the three
Iowa College classes, are eligible
to compete. It is to be hoped that
many will take advantage oi this
opportunity. The money value
of the prize lsin itself an incentive
for entering, and the value of the
training received, even though one
does not sccurca place on the ﬁnal
contest, will be great. The Hyde
Prize contest. in the past, has not
received the attention which it der
serves. and has not amused sufﬁ~
cient competition to bring about
the best results. It has too often
been the case that the number of
contestants from a class has not
been more than enough to ﬁll out
the required number. Seances
AND BLACK would like to scc ati
awakening of interest along this
line. as along all lines. oi-aiory is
an important department of any
college and should not be neglects
ed. We rcici all who may desire
inloimation on this subject to the
issue of SCARLET AND BLACK for
February 3, and to thc noticespost—
ed around the college buildings.

Professor Herronr

The chair oi Applied Cluistiain
ity at iowa College is to be vacat»
ed. Professor Herron has sure
priserl even
Christian spirit he has shown in
resigning a protessorship created
especially for him. His radical
teachings have inﬂuenced the
thoughts of thousands and his
name is known throughoutthe nae
tion. The attendance in his lec»
lure room was steadily increased
during the years he has been cone
nected the college. But
some of the lrietids and trustees
of the school have bitterly oppos-
ed him, and in response to their
clamor he has graciously bowed
to their wishes.

Whatever may be the protes-
sor's faults, however erratic he
may be in his teaching. he has
certainly made trieuds or his ener
mies by the manly spirit shown
in his letter to the trustees of the
college.~77te Edi/ti: (Dram.

The program tor Music-Literary
Monday was very interesting in
that it had to do with one of the
more modein schools, the Russian,
which is rapidly becoming prom-
inerlt.

Miss Atkinson told in an inter
esting manner of contemporary
Russian composers whose number
is quite large.

Miss McCornack gave a paper
on Tchaikowsky, one of the most
prominent composers of today.
Miss Rew, accompanied by Miss
l—iill. played Tchaikowslty's "Sere-
nade" in her usual artistic manner.
