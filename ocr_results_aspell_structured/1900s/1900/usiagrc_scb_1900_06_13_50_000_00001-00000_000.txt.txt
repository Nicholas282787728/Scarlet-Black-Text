Our English vcrsion of the last clause
of the ﬁrst verse of this chapter reads.
“Ye believe in God, believe also in me,"
The American members of the Commit-
tee on revision, which committee
was made up both ni Englishmen
and Americans, preier the translation
“Believe in God," counting the vcrb to
be imperative rather than indicativei
an invitation instead of an assertion.
The word “believe in" in each instance
"Ye believe in God, believe also in me"
is precisely the same. Studentsof Greek
will understand that the form of the
verb does not determine whether it
should he translated as an imperative or
as an indicative. That must be deter
mined by outside reasons either from the
context or from coniormity to the rest of
Jesus' teachings, or indeed irom so com.
monplacc a consideration as what Jesus
would be likely to say.

It seems to me that the American opin-
ion is right and that both the verbs are
in the imperative. "Believe in God, be-
lieve also in me." If one may venture to
shorten it yet more for the sake of emr
phasis, let us translate it “Trust God;
trust me also." That exhortation of
Jesus' to Trudi Gorl is our theme.

Set the Words in their environment. It
is Jesus' last evening with his little com-
pany at twelve beiorc his cruciﬁxion. It
isvhis “farewell address" to them. Al-
though there is no cheap sentiment with
which we often till our human partings,
yet the occasion is itself one of deepest
seriousness, We should naturally slip-
pose that of all the earnest words which
Jesus might utter. these would be most
serious. He had chosen these dozcn
men with which He was to overturn the
great empires oi earth, (com the ranks
oi the simple, humble, honest poor. He
did not go to the great schools, to the
learned and inﬂuential men, not to men
in places oi power or prominence. He
chose men who were simple enough to
be willing to learn and poor enough to
be free. This has :always seemed to be
God's way, Moses, David, Isaiah, the
twelve disctples, were from the ranks of
the common people. The great heroes
and contributors of the human race in
the iiisiory oi civilization have nearly all
(there have been some honorable excep-
tions) sprang from humble origins. With
these twelve he has gathered and ”Jesus,

knowing that the Father had glven all
things into his hands and that he was

full consciousness ofwhai hewas and
what they were, and what these words
must mean to them, opens his mouth to
speak out the fullness of his heart. His
utterances breathe love and encoilrager
ment. Oh, what awortl is that it we
would hcarit. How it would still the
troubled waves oi the stormy sea oi hu»
man life, it all men would hear the voice
oi Jesus saying, “Let not your heart be
troubled." It is as if He would look into
the eyes oi us all anti say: "Why are
you anxiousi What are you worried
about? Why will you not take the peace
that is at your hand? Let not your heart
be troubled. Trust God. Trust me also,
who have come to tell you what God is
like and to show you how inﬁnitely he
loves you, how even the hatred of soldier
and priest, even the theocratic power of
the Jewish nation and the legal, military
power oi the great Roman nation itscli,
queen of all the Civili’LCd earth at that
time, can not disturb grounds oi conﬁ-
dence in God or in me, though hitter
hatred, with all extant human power

which human ingenuity has devised to

come to bring. twill take the cross on
which they hang me and redeem it over
into a symbol oi the only power that can

And is not Indeed the cross the symbol
of all that is holiest and safest and help-
tulest on earth evenunto this day? It is
the sign of all the churches; it is the
chiei symbol in all creeds; the sign oi
the "Red Cross" cvcn silences the mouth
of riﬂe and cannon in the midst otthe
horrors of war. The cross is the most
powcrtui symbol in human altairs unto
this day, and its power has hardly yet

We may be sure that that idcal will stay
by us. The human race will never yield
it up. The Kingdom oicodshail come;
which means no war any more, peace,
honor, conﬁdence among men, mutual
helptalness among all peoples and
nations.

The heart oi hearts oi the gospel is in
that call, trust God. The gospel is not
in the world to dely all other religions or
challenge all infidelity; the call oi Jesus
is not the “challenge oi iaitii." but is in.
vitation to the spirit oi man to come and
rest in conﬁdence in God. it is a gentle,
winning, pica g call: will you not

tion in a voice like that. There is nothr
ing on which to base conﬁdence if it he a
noisy order, We can not yield our con-
ﬁdence in response to such an attack.
God's dealing with us, it we would only
let him deal so, is by the way of “Come,
let lls rcasoli together." Not in the wind
nor storm nor ﬁre. hilt in the still small
voice is the real voice oiGoK ' the soul.

Oh, that the world might hear his
into our vast ignorance comes
one clear voice. Voice of knowledge?
Not much of that. More of faith. If we
are to have deep peace at all, we shall
have it by learning to walk, not by sight
hut hy iaitli; less by what we know ot
God, inﬁnitely more oi how much we
trust God. There Is no other condition.
\Ve can go without peace it we like, and
liiost of the world seems to have settled
to that way. Some may even ﬁnd a ho.
vine lack of trouble in stolid relusal to
think, and conﬁning activity to chewing
the cud oi commonplace satisiaction,
trying to escape trouble, even the trouble
of earliest thought. But the way of di-
vlnc peace lies not thither. If we want
some positive life satisfaction, if we want
something that responds to the divine
demand in us for action; not mere Nir»
vana absence oi annoyance, but presence
of activity; not negative freedom but
positive truilnpli of obedience: in other
words, a call to life, and not to die in
spirit bciorc the breath stops; it we
seek abiding peace that has worthy qualr
ities in it, that we shall have under the
oile cpndiiion ot trusting God.

Some one may say: “Well, oi course
we are in his power, might as well trust
Him; we have got to do so anyway."
The call of God is better than that. He
does not invite us to trust him because
he is powerful, can hurt us if we do not.
He does not reioicc in our helplessness.
"Herein is love: that He ﬁrst loved us.”
God never asks us to do anything that
he has not ﬁrst (lone. God is not, in his
dignity oi remoteness, waiting tar as to
heel: hiln out. He comes to “S. In the
parable oi the Prodigal, the father, hotw
ever unworthy the soninay, impelled by
the very measure oi his uiiivorthiness,
runs to meet him while he is yet afar off.

In the last analysis it will be seen that
trust and conﬁdence cannot be command-
ed. It can only be won. Obedience can
he commanded, but obedience is not the
end of life. Obedience is only the means
by which we may attain unto the follow-
shlp with God and with all that is best
in the universe, through trusting God.

ls it not the very perversity oi human
llle that leads us to put our conﬁdence
in everything else but God? We will

in anything whatever except the one
place where conﬁdence can really ration-
ally rest with assurance that there is no
mistake about it, conﬁdence in God.

As our experience in life widens, do
we not see over and over again that con-
ﬁdence any lvhere else is as a house
builded on the sand? Put not your trust
in riches; they can so easily iiy away.
Put not your trust in the opinion which
your ioliowmen may hold oi you; for it
is a proverb thatthcreis nothing so tickle
as the change of public opinion. You
maybe praised to-day and cursed tar
niorrow, although you yourseii may
change nota whit. Whetheraman be
famous, as men count tame, or infamous
in thelrjudgment, may depend not upon
him but upon some trivial incident or
mere whim oi public opinion. One day
a man is a hero at whose feet the nation
falls in admiration and almost worship;
the next day, through no fault whatever
oi his, he may he the laughing stock oi
all. The reversals of the judgment of
men, the reversals of the historical esti-
mate of men; this is the tritest common—
place oi human experience. Poor stuii
all, for the foundation of such conﬁdence
as a man with the dignity of immortality
in him may want to build himself upon.
Life is too serious that we live it by
guesses and chances and contingencies.
If we have nothing but riches or inﬂu-
ence or popular opinion, reputation or
position to build upon, why then human
life in its essence has no better founda-
tion than the shifting winds oi the sky.‘

"Glory oi warrior, glory ol orator, glory ol song:
Paid by a voice tlying byto he lost on an endless
sea."

Is this all? Has human life no solider
foundation, no ivorthicr dignity than
that? Or, on the other hand, is it possi»
ble in this great universe of God to ﬁnd
afoundation on which we may build,
which can not be moved? Is there any
place where we can put our conﬁdence
with the profoundest assurance oi the
soul that it is not placed there in vain?
in the midst otallour intellectual uncer-
tainties, is there no certainty? Is all
knowledge vain? The vanity of much
that counts ior knowledge is known by
none so well as they who aiter the man-
ner of men maybe thought to be p05~
sessed oi most knowledge. is there not
then a call to faith? [5 there notu ground
oi conﬁdence? is there not then an ap-
pcal to a trust in which the soul oi man
can ﬁnd rest and peace?

Yes, there is such a place. There is
such ground. There is such an appeal.
And that is what the universal church of
theliving Godstands to emphasize. That
is what Jesus Christ is in the world, has
been hodiiy and is by spirit. to reveal to
us. it is not egotism ior Him to say:
“Trust me also , When or wherever his
voice can be heard, as it is here, He forti»
lies his call to men to trust God by the
corroboration of tho elucidating appeal,
“Trust me also" Elucidating. because
"He that hath seen me, hath seen the
father."
