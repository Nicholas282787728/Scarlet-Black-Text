State Tennis Tournament.

The State Tennis ’l‘ournament was
held, as usual, under very discourag-
ing' conditions. It is a matter of corr-
siderable dorrbt whether there ever was
a tennis tournament at Grinuell urr
accompanied by rain, and this instance
certainly was no exception to the rule.

Rain on Thursday morning effectually
dampened the hopes of the tennis en-
thusiasts and the corrrts at the same
time, and necessitated adjournment to
the men’s gymnasiuirr, where the pre—
liminaries were played in the after-

noon.
The drawings in singles resulted in
matching Belden of Orinnell against
Ellis of Penn and Moore of Cornell
against the State University; in dour
bles, Cornell drew Penn, and Grinnell
the State University. Asno team was
present to represent Iowa City, Cor-
nell won her matches in singles and
Orirrnell her’s in doubles, by default,
leaving in the preliminaries, Belden’s
match against Ellis, and that of the
Cornell double team against Penn.
Ellis made short work of his young-
er arrd more inexperienced competitor
and won in straight sets, 6—1, 670,
Belden’s work was good in the ﬁrst
set, brrt he weakened in the last. Ellis
showed the form, which he nrarrifested
throughout the tournament, always
steady and accurateand often brilliant.
The match in doubles between
Moore and Ferris of Cornell and Ellis
and Mattrer of Penn, brought out some
very ﬁne tennis. Both teams played
well together, and every point was
hotly contested. The Cornell men
won the first set, 6 4, through accur-
acy ol’ placing and good Work at the
net. l’enn braced and took the sece
0nd, 672, but weakened in the third
and Cornell won the set and match,
62.
The playing on Friday afternoon

.form at the net, and the volleyirrg of

 

decided the ﬁnale between (Jrrnnell
and Cornell in the doubles, and Cor-
nell and Penn in the singles. in the,
doubles, Moore and Ferris of Cornell
displayed the same good form which
they had manifested the day before,
and defeated Swan and F sbie or
Grinnell in straight sets, 6-1,6-1,o-4.
The Grirurell team braced in the last set
and played better tennis, but not good
enough to win.

The ﬁnals in singles between Moore
of Cornell and Ellis of Penn, brought
out the best playing of the whole tour-
nament. Every point was fought for,
and long and brilliant rallies were free
quent. Both men displayed llreir best

both was remarkable. Ellis won the
ﬁrst two sets, 6-}, 671, although the
playing was much closer than the
score indicates, but it was not until
the score of the last set had reached
i2~to, that he was able to wrest the
ﬁnal victory from his plucky adver-
sary.

The state championship in singles
goes to Penn; in doubles, to Cornell.

At the business meeting of the asso-
ciation, held on Thursday evening, it
was decided to hold next year’s tour-
namerrt at Mount Vernon. Invitations
were extended to Ames, the State
Normal and Des Moines College to
join the association. The tournament
passed ofi without any rrupleasant tear
tures, and notwithstanding the rain, it
can be truthfully called a success in
every particular.

Calocagathia.

Calocagathia Hall was crowded to
its utmost capacity when the program
opened Friday afternoon, the reason
for the presence ot so many visitors
being the presentation of several scenes
from Mr. Stephen l’hillips’ poetical
drama, ”Paola and Francesca,”

 

Before the curtain was drawn Mrs. ,
Whitcomb sang the beautiful little

thousand
Eyes." Mrs. \\’hitcorub’s singing is
too well known to need any special
praise.

Hclen Starr gave a criticism and rc-
view of the drama, “Paola and Fran-
cesca,”giving adcrailedstoryot the plot
in order that the three scenes presented
might be rrrrrr understood. The story
isquile simple. As Arthur sent Launcc-
lot. so Giovanni sends Paola, hrs
brother, to escort his beautiful young
bride to his grim old castle. The two
young people are unable to resist the
love which comes over their hearts,
and Giovanni, discovering \this, kills
them in each olher’s arms.

The poetical tone ol’ the play is
very beautiful and its presentation did
not lessen this beauty. Those taking
part were Misses Millerd, Denise, Mor-
rison, Henderson, Leach and Brunt-
lett. The parts were all well taken,
Miss Denise and Miss Henderson being,
perhaps, the strongest, while Carrie
Laurence acted the part at the old,
blind nurse wonderfully well.

On the whole this was one of [he
most Successful dramatic ell’orts given
by the society for some years.

Ellis.

"Ire opening- musical number of the
afternoon was a vocil solo by Mrs.
Heidel, rcndered with her never»l’ailing
charm. She kindly responded to the
hearty applause with a lullaby song.
The roll call was responded to by in
cidents in the lives of famous artists,
which were well given and gave many
pleasing glimpses of the real lite of
men who in rtpt to be merc names to
most of us.

The debate, “Resolved, That Sculpt-
ure and Architecture have Contributed
More to Religion than Painting,” was
upheld on the afﬁrmative by Annie
Shrlcy, and by volunteer speakers who
took the tree of Olive Shockley.
Elizabeth Risser and Ada l’ark ably de-
fended the negative, but the decision
was not rendered owing to the failure
ot the judges to agree.

Grace Burton gave a recitation in a
very pleasing manner. A talk upon
the Paris exposition, well illustrated
with views of the grounds and of sep-
arate buildings, was given rn a clear
and interesting way by Katherine
Macy.

The program closed with a vocal
solo by Nellie Clarke.
day is a regular college holiday, the
socrcty will be entertained by Miss
Moody, at her home, at the regular
hour tor meeting.
