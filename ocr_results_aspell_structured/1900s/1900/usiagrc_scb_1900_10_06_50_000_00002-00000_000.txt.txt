THERE ls atpresentamovement
on foot in regard to the organizae
tion of 3 Girls' Glee Club. This
movement is to be highly come
mended for it would certainly
prove a valuable addition to the
entertaining tunctions of the cole
lege,

The senior girls have begun the
movement by organizing a Senior
Girls' Glee Club under the direc—
tion of Prof. and Mrs. Cole. ‘ To
be sure this is a class organization
and hence can not be permanent
but a Girls’ Glee Club could be
made as permanent as the College
Glee Club, which in its compara~
tively short existence has proven
itself a necessary requisite as a
means of entertainment in college
circles. The SCARLET AND BLACK
feels assured that the Girls’ Glee
Club, if organized at once, would
also prove a very valuable factor
in the activities of the college and
since the movement has begun let
every girl who has any musical
ability come forth and do what
sheis able to make this movement
a success.

The initiatory step has been
taken and with a little Cosoperas
tion and earnest endeavor a novel
and entertaining feature may
claimrecognition amongthe other
pleasant phases now existing in
college life,

WE Wish to call your attention
to the Oratorical Association and
the annual contest. In another
column you have been urged to

compete. We teel free to reiter-
ate the call. It is never a dis-
grace to receive a low place in a
contest of any kind when we have
done our/7:31. But it is certainly
no credit to be defeated year after
year both in debate and oratory
by schools. which though as good,
are at least smaller than ours.
The ﬁrst requisite of a successful
contest is competion. Two years
ago at Cornell one hundred and
ﬁfty orations were put in the hands
of the oratorical committee by the
students. From this exceedingly
large number of papers those of
superior merit were selected for
the home contest. This throws
some light on the secret of Cor-
nell'ssuccess. In oratorythesuc-
cess of the college depends on the
success of the individual. The in-
dividual must win by his own ef-
forts. The rivalry of the contest
only spurs the individual to great-
er eﬂort, We would again urge
all who possibly can, to write for
the annual contest, The respon-
sibility for failure in the state con-
test—if \ve failfmust rest upon
every individual in the college
who, without excellent reason, l‘es
loses to appear as a candidate to.
ﬁrst place honors this fall.

This PRELIMINARY game with
Drake has been played and lost.
The showing made by the wearers
of the scarlet and black is not
even suggestive of discourage-
ment to their supporters. Not
that we \VlSh to offer any excuse
for our defeat, for our opponents
with their style of play for the
season‘already well developed,
played better football and won
the game on its merits, However,
two features of the work of the
Grinnell team cannot be over-
looked, viz.. its desperate defense
at critical times and its splendid
physical condition. The former
indicates that the new men though
lacking in weight are not to be
found wanting in carrying out
the well known spirit of Grinnell
athletics; the latter is but another
tribute to the abilties of Trainer
Watson.
