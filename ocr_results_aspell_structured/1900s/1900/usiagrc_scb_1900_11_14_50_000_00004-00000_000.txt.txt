ANOTHER DEFEAT!

Nebraska too Much for Grinnell.

in as many weeks, for which such
careiul preparation hasbecn made,
is almost a thing of the past. The
fourth game was played with the
Nebraska team at Lincoln last
Saturday, and Grinnell was com-
pletely outclassed to the tune of
33 to o. It was a sad sight to the
Grinnell supporters who watched
their team put up a maniul ﬁght
against irresistible odds. The
Grinnell team did not getdiscouh
aged and put toith on‘ly hall-lleart~
ed efforts. In the face of certain
deteat and an obviously Superior
team, it tried to the very last
moment of the last half, and for
that we aie proud. Though the
game is lost, our reputation tor
spirit and sticlc-toritriyeness still
continues.

it was a wretched day. The air
was cold and the wind blew as
only a Nebraska wind can blowi
straight from the unobstructed
plains beyond the city. But to
the surprise of the Grinncll rep-
resentatives, who, by the way, are
not accustomed to see large, en-
thusiastic crowds of people even
under the most favorable atmos-
pherical conditions, this inclemen-
cy of weather didn’t seem to cut
the slightest ﬁgure. The grand-
stand was full of ladies, the side-
lines were crowded with coaches,
tally-hos and rooms. in spite or
cold hands, feet and noses, the en
tliusiasm continued undiminished
and was a ﬁne exhibition ot spir

Nebraska won the toss and
chose the goal with the wind in

their favor. For the ﬁrst ten min-
utes the play was tairly even.
Twice Grinnell recovered the ball
inside her ﬁlteen yaid line and
Clarke drove it back into the very
teeth of the wind. Then Nebras»
ka started its heavy, plunging at»
tack thi rough and outside the tack-
,les. Coach Booth, Princeton’s
former center, has drilled excclr
lent team-work into his men. The
man with the ball was never alone,
he always had two or three team-
mates to pull him along an extra
yard or two after he was tackled,
And so it went,until at the end ot
the ﬁrst halt the score stood 22-0.

In the second half Clark’s punt-
ing won the admiration ot all the
Nebraska enthusiasts, and was by
far the best exhibition of the kind
given on a Lincoln gridiron this
season. Grinnell's only chance of
scoring was an attempted placer
kick for goal lrorri the thirtyrﬁve
yard line. The ball sailed straight
as an arrow between the goal
posts, but passed two teet below
the bar, Quarterback Drain and
Hall-back Crandall were the star

players of the Nebraskas, though

the whole team played fast and

together. and were in excellent

physical condition. Nebraskahas
