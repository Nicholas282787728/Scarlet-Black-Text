THE WESTERN Intercollegiate

Ath 'c Association holds its
sixth annual meet in Chicago to-

day, Although the meets Con» ERIK:

ducted by this Association have
been uniformly fair, and as suc-
cessful ﬁnancially as the majority
of meets, nevertheless, the “Big
Nine," at a recent conference, de-
cided that the meets had not been
successful, and could not be until
taken in hand by the “Big Nine”
themselves. Until some other mos
tive is shown by them for breakr
ing up the W. I. A. A., as they
undoubtedly will at the meeting
tonight, the lmaller schools have
some reason to fear that it is
merely a move to get rid of them.
While there is no doubt but that
the "Big Nine” could hold suc-
cessful meets without the recog»
nition of these smaller schools,
they do not show the true sports»
manlike spirit in shutting out this
competition, and especially is this
lack of spirit shown by some of
the “Big Nine",wllo are not al-
ways victorious over these smaller
schools in their own states.

Calocagathia.

On Friday afternoon, the Calo-
cagathian society closed a very
successful year’s work by the cus-
tomary farewell program, given in
honor of the graduating members.
The Senior members entered to
the music of a march played by
Miss Helen Thompson. and after
they had taken their places, the
prophecy, written by Miss Grace
Douglass,was read by Miss Richer.
The fate predicted for each grad»
uale was always startling and often
ludicrous, and the attention ofthe
audience was kept on the alert un-
til it was ﬁnished

After a charming vocal solo by
Miss Marie Bousquet, Miss Mare
tha Miller presented gifts to the
graduates which were calculated
to be of special assistance to them
during their future lives. Miss
Miller’s address was written in
rhyme and was a very clever pro-
duction. The presents were well
chosen and were productive of
much men‘iment,

Miss Carrie Denise of the Sen-
ior class delivered the valedictory,
expressing the feeling of the old
members toward the society and

Ellis.

For years it has been the privi»
lege of the Ellis girls on what is
known as “Seniol Day,” to listen
to words of counsel from the lips
of our beloved Mrs. Gates, and
the Seniors have received their
diplomas from her hands. She
has been sadly mlssed by all the
I. C. girls this year, and the Ellis
Senior girls felt that something
would be lacking trom the pleas
ure of this, without her presence.
To show that her healt was with
the society. and to leave with the
girls something which should in a
way represent her to those mem~
bers in the future, who have never
known her, Mrs. Gates sent a beau-
tiful copy of the Sistine Madonna
(detail), to be presented to the
society at this last meeting by the
outgoing president. This gift,
valuable in itself, is prized even
more for the sake of the giver
than for its own worth.

Mrs. Noble was chosen by the
society as the one best ﬁlled to
take Mrs. Gates’ place. In her
words to the girls, she spoke es-
pecially of what a college bi-erl
girl's life should mean in the
home, and of the essential charac-
teristics of that home, pointingby
way of illustration, to the homes of
two women so dear to us all, Mrs.
Gates and Mrs. Parker.

Alter the presentation of di-
plomas, the society and visitors

were servedwith strawberry frappé
by the Senior girls, and a half
hour was spent in a general good
time.

ThevocalsolobyMissBousquct
was rendered in her pleasing way,
which never fails to call forth
hearty applause.
