Chrestomathian.

Saturday evening, the Cllrestt}
mathian society met in their hall
tor the regular 5 ion. The fea
ture ot the evening was a series of
papers on the great statesmen of
history,

Hamilton. the American, was
portrayed by McCarty. who show
ed a thorough knowledge of the
man and his work and a broad
comprehension of the problems
which Hamilton faced.

Grier gave his time to Moses.
the wonderful leader of a peculiar
people. Moses was the greatest
statesman of ancient, and possibly
otail, history.

Arnold spoke on Lycurgus. the
Greek. While there is some doubt
about the acts and institutions
which Lycurgus is said to have
founded. and even about his exist-
ence. there is no doubt that some
such man did live and act. It is
a remarkable fact that all modern
theories of ideal states, as Moore’s
"Utopia," seem to refer unconr
scrously to thecondition of Greece
under Lycurcus.

Justinian', the Roman Emperor,
was given by Oswald Rlsser. The
chiet traits ofjllstinlan, according
to Mr. Risser, were his selﬁshness
and his pride. He was not, as so
often said. the codiﬁer of the Ru»
man laws,but rather the Slmpilﬁ;r
and collector of them. He
an example of the power and ex~
ecuttve ability of the Roman.

Altred. the great Englishman.
came next, given by Bairt

Arthur Rrsser gave a very in-
teresting paper on Bismark, the
Uniﬁer of Germany. Bismark.
the man of blood and iron. the
man of power, was yet the tnan
tor the tune. He round Germany

was

 

ina medizeval condition and he
used mediazval methods to bring
her out of them. He was not the
leader but the master of the Ger-
man people, but he lulnllcd his
destiny and left a German nation

In the extentpqt'anems worlt.
McKeag spoke "as one having
authority" on thcbasltet ball game
at Des Moines.

McMartin considered what Iowa
College owes to President Crates,
Ittlle college should attempt to
pay tlle bill as Mr. Martin pre
sented it, it would probably go
into bankruptcy.

Williams discussed the value of
the exposition at Paris to the
world of science.

The debate was on the Hay
Fauncefoie treaty and its ratiﬁcae
tion by the U. S senate. Moller
delended the treaty and urged its
ratiﬁcation. Hays opposed the
treaty from every standpoint. The
debate was interesting and [till of
decisive points. McKee summed
up and gave the negative his ties
cision.

Caloca~lnstltute Play.

“Lady Bountiful” has been ale
most as popular on the stage as
"Sweet Lavender," and is of a
higher grade of dramatic interest.
Although the main plot is along
rather conventional lilies, as
most of Pinero's plays. this defect
is largely redeemed by the char
acter portrayal and inrlividtlzlllzde
tion, and by the really ﬁne humor.
With respect to the latter. it would
be difﬁcult to ﬁnd, in contempor»
ary drama at least, so ﬁnea minge
ling of humor and pathos as in
the character oi sir Richard Phil

his wile alter their misfortune,

are all pleasant with the exception
of one, who, however, is dispensed
with before the last act.

The sittings present a pleasing
variety. being different for each
oi the four acts. and including the
country scat of the Brents and
the interior of the parish church.
as well as settings in London,

“Lady Bountiful" is not one of
Finer-es problem plays. being
much like “Sweet Lavender," as an
example oia pretty, kindly, enr

drama that does not impose too
much weight upon the spectators”
From the stand

Junior Annual.

The Junior class wish to an-
nounce through SCARLET AND
BLACK the character of the "Jilin
tor Annual,"

Before proceeding upon a
course of action an effort
made to determine what sort of an
“Anllual”\\lou|d best please the
student body. Owing to the noun
dance or plays which have been
presented lately, it is not deemed
wise to attempt anything in the
dramatic line, But from every
indication the time seems ripe for
an "Annual" partaking of the tra-
ttlre of the old Grinnell cyclone.

We believe that such a prodnc

idea of a college ”Annual."a|so
most truthfully portrays college
tire. The Comic pl'cdnlllinatesln

was

tightly, for. if we have observed
correctly,students are very apt to
view things hunt the laughable
side. Such an “Annual" has the
value of being permanent and is
something which willvividly recall
the incidents or school drys and
will assist in retaining the tune
and color of college life,

With this thought in nrind the
Junior class has decided to put
out an “Annual" this spring which
will be, in contents and ttirre.some-

whatsimilai‘to the old "Cyclones.“

It \\'lii deal exclusively with col-
lege hie and will attempt in cm
lrudy the most representative in-
crdents in the last two college
years.
