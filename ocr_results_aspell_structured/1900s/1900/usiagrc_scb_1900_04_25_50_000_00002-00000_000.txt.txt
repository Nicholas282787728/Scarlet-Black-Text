THE ARTICLE which recently
appeared in these columns rela
tive to the resumption of athletic
relations with Drake University,
seems to have been misunderstood
by the editor of tlle Drake Univer-
sity“Delphic,” While we have
no desire to reopen an old cons
troversy. we wish to state by ivay
of correction that tile editorial rev
‘terred to by the "Delphic"\vas
in no way intended as an apology
for the position which Iowa Col-
lege has held during the last tewl
months with regard to athletics.
We feel that this position was in
every way justiﬁed by conditions
then existing. In the belief that
these conditions no longer require
ed attention, the article in
question was written, with no eats
pectation that it would be putto
such a use as that which the editor
of the "Delphic" has chosen to

‘ make of it. We feel that we have
stated all that is necessary to
make our meaning clear, altho
there is still much which might
be said with reference to the
statement in the “‘Delphic." It
is merely our purpose here to put
an end to the belief,‘ which may
exist in the mind at any one, that
we are apologizing for a course
for which no apologies are neces-
sary. The editor otthe"Delphic"
has apparently wished it to ap-
pear that we have acknowledged
our fault and asked for reconcilias
tion, whereas the true condition
of things is just the reverse.
While we wish it to be understood
that we are glad that athletic re-
lations have been resumed, still
we feel that there should be no
misunderstanding on the other
point.

Prof. Norrls' Lecture.

The ﬁrst of the series of tour
lectures by members of the facul-
ty was given Monday in the chap-
el, by Prof. Norris. Tile lecture
-was listened to by a large number
ot town people as well as students,
The subject or the the lecture was
”What we know of Pre-historic
Manr”

There are various theories re
garding the origin or man but of
this we are certain; that man as
we ﬁrst know him is very low
down in the scale of culture and
also ot a low physical type.

We know little of primitive
man; what kind Of’being he was,
where he ﬁrst appeared and how
long he has been upon the earth,

 

The nearest that we can come to

an answer is to survey the taetsl
known to us

it is customary to divide pie-
historic existance of the human
species into three periods: I-
The Stone Age; ziThe Bronze
Age; 3*The Iron Age. Of man
in the Bronze and Iron age we
have a fairly adequate idea. it
is that remoter period, the Stone
Age that excites greatest interest.
The Stone Age consists of two
well marked divisions, namely the
Rough Stone Age and the Polish-
ed Stone Age.

The lecture was profusely ilr
lustraled by stereoptieon views
showing human skulls, stone im-
plements, and numerous interest
ing relics which are supposed to
be the remains of the stone age.
It is from these relics found for
the the most part in Europe and
particularly in France that we get
our information regarding pre-
historic man.

The next lecture of the series
will be given by Prof, Hendrixson
on the subject, "Gothic cathe-
drals." This lecture will also be
illustrated.

Edward Everett Hole
The speaker for the ﬁnal llunl'
ber of the Yr M. C. A. course was
chosen with reference to the liter-
ary interest involved in his long
career as a writer and intimate as-

sociation with many ot our best
beloved poets and novelists. Mr.
Hale is almost the last of those
whose memories of the Cambridge
poets are of a direct, familiar, per
sonal sort, and his lecture will be
the only one we have had thus tar
of that nature, viz: Of indivrdual
reminiscences or that group of
American writers whom we have
learned to hold deal, and to read
sympathetically rather than arias
lytically. Mr. Hale has been, not
a commanding ﬁgurein American
literature. but a worthy one. unit
ing as he has done, the calling of
author with that of Christian min-
ister. His work in ﬁction is not
as powerful as that or some of
our contemporary writers, butit is
on the whole more hopeful, and
much of it is pervaded with the
kindliest element of real religious
feeling. Judging from his lite and
work, it is reasonable to expect
from him, if not a brilliant,a thol'»
oughly interesting lecture Friday
