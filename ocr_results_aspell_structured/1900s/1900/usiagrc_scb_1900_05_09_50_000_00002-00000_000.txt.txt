QBDitoriul

FROM AN editorial in the ill/3mm-
mm Daily we take pleasure in clip-
ping the following, as a testimony
to the record which Grinnell
teams have made during the long
space of years in which athletic
relations have existed between the
two institutions: “In Grinnell. a
truly college team from Iowa will
be matched against our own. Grin-
nell is one of the strongest smaller
colleges, her students are typical
college men, and it is a treat to
engage in athletic contests with

her."
—..—

It Is with the greatest regret
that we mention the death of Rev.
Loren F. Berry, whichoccurred on
Tuesday, at his home in Chicago.
For several years Mr. Bel'ry had
been one of the most faithful and
efﬁcient of the board of trustees of
the college, and we feel that in him
the college loses one of its best
and most devoted friends. In his
visits here, Mr. Berry often spoke
to the students, and his words on
such occasions only deepened the
regard in which he was held by
them. Mr. Berry was not only a
good trustee, but a good man, and
his loss will be felt in all of the
many activities in which he was
actively engaged at the time ot his
death.

RUBBING?

One or the most frequent symptoms
of eye strain is u desire to rub the eyes.
It seems n relief to close the lids down
tight upon the eyebnlla and to press
them with the ﬁngers. Thra in pnrtiuu.
Inrly at. reading. At ﬁrst. the type is
clear and dlBLtnoL, but in n few moments
the eyes became rirad. Thorn la ti burns
rngor itching sensation and the type
ruustogether. Altar rubbing the eyes
and keeping them olosad n ten minutes
lherendrng once more elanre up—hut
only tor nahort runs. In it few seconds
the slime trouble occurs lipzuio. There
never wuan cuss of ths kind that glues-
ea did not relieve. It is simply it mutter
of ovareworked muscles and by wanting
lenses the work is lessened. If your
eyes trouble you in this may. call and
see me. i do not charge tor the examin-
