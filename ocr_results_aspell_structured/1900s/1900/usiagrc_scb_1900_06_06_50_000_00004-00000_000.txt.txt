Mr. Campbell's Lecture.
(Contrnrrccl lmlll First Poacl

This coincs trorn inc great cor
porations, and it has enormous
weight whether it be ill-fountlctl
or not. Then theresult is incont-
pctent men go into ofﬁcc—»tlle
practical l'elormer hccoirrcs thc
illsfavored candidate and the
friends of the vested intelcsts is
elected. In this way thcsc irrtcr-
csts rather than the people sccurc
and hold control both of our city
and state governments, It must
not be thought that this control is
secured by direct blibery, rarely
is this the case. The method fol-
lowcd is simple. The corporate
interests being rvcll orgallizcd,thcy
select men who they know will
not be inimical to their interests.
They elect them, and proceed to
place them under obligations to
them. The men know that their
election is due to the corporations
and their continuance in ofﬁcc is
subject to their action, so they be.
conic virtually slaves to the man
who securcd them ill ofﬁcer Thus
in an indirect way most of the
bribery is accomplished.

Toclay the importancc ot pro/:-
”1y intern/5 over the public \vels

fare is greatly exaggerated, and
becomes at once a hindrance in

all reforms attempted.

It is not the ignoraat classes in
our cities today that are lesponsis

presentcuntlltions it means a great
sacriﬁce for a business man to
cntcr- a city council or go on tllc
board of public works. What we
need just now Is an intelligcnt
public spirit that will give public
service a lust r-crvar-rl and dignity

present lost hope.

some time ago offered Smoo to

such a tuss that thc president was
forced to refuse it.
