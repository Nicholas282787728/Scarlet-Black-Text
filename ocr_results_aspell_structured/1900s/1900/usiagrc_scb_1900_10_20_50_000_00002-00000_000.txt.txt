IT Is THE popular belief that a
second team is of minor import-
ance and not worthy of much cons
sideration and attention. No
greater mistake can be made in
regard to football. The second
team is but an index of the ﬁrst,
or, in plainer words, no ’Varsity
can develop without a scrub; and,
furthermorethe degree of strength
found in the ’Varsity is usually
due to a corresponding degree in
the scrub, all things considered.
See then, the importance of a
good second team. See also, how
it should be encouraged. No
surer mode of encouragement can
be‘tound than by giving the team
games. Today is played the ﬁrst
second team game of the season.
Two more games follow. Athletic
enthusiasts are exhorted to ens
courage the second team not only
by their attendance at practice
and at the games, but by a posi-
tive interest. Don't be so wrapped
up in the ’Varsity, as to forget the
'Varsity’s co-Iaborers and sup-
porters. Be interested regardless
of the ﬂuctuations of the season‘s
score, lor from this year’s second
team must Come the ﬁrst team two
years hence. And it is unneces»
sary to assert that we want a good
'varsity every fall of the year.

I903 Husklng Bee,

At six o'clock last night the
Sophomore class, arrayed in rustic
bonnets and plowmens jackets,
assembled at the steps of Blair
Hall in response to the call of
their social committee.

Two hayracks carried thejolly
crowd of farmers to the Goodtel-
low farm north of town. where
they were escorted by the social
committee to a large empty cornr
crib.

Here they were divided into
four groups, with an equal amount
of corn for each to husk, and the
word given to start, the nimble Fm-
gers began tearing off the yellow
husks. The work being done, the
party repaired to a second corn-
crib where “John” played the ﬁd-
dle and “Hank” the mouthrorgan,
while the merry rustic couples
formed for the Virginia Reel.

Husking party games, which were
interrupted by niorenr less throw-
ing of corn and heateddiscussions
of the crops and markets were in-
dulged in.

A substantial and well earned
supper was then served, consist»
ing of hot “Weenies," buns, pump-
kin pie, doughnuts and coffee.

The corn-cribs were lighted by
Jackro’danterns and tastefully de-
corated with class colors. The
evening was superb and the hay—
rack ride enjoyed by all. As the
party left the farm they stopped
in front of the house of Mr. Wells,
who had so generously loaned the
use of his buildings to the Class,
and expressed their thanks in
hearty yells in in which they all
concluded that “Wells was all
right.”
