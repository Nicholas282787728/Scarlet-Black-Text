W
F. Hopkinson Smith.

The best lecture, number thus
far on the Y. M. C. A. course was
given on the evening of February
23. by Mr. F. Hopkinson Smith,
in a series of readings from his
own works.

To those who have watched Mr.
Smith’s gradual rise into promi-
nence as a man of letters, and the
steady conscienliousness of liis
work from the ﬁrst, such an ape
portunity of judging the man at
ﬁrst hand could not be other than
a valuable one. Mr. Smith's ease
as a platform lecturer is accompm
nied by a pleasing freedom from
mannerisms and conventional re-
straint, and his hearing is charac-
terized by a heartiness and kindli-
ness which won the sympathy oi
the audience from the beginning

Perhaps no feature oi Mr.
Smith’swoik rs quite so prominent
as its variety and scope. He is
not only a worker in many depart
menls of lifegliterature, art, arch-
itecture, engineering—but within
the limits of book-writing itself
his versatility is remarkable, In
the course oi his readings he ex-
pressed no less tlian ﬁve distinct
cliaracteiulypes. with their appro-
priate dialect and personal peculi»
arities. Hrs stories on the whole
rest upon character interest rather
than plot interest to sustain them,
as in the latier his pretensions are
usually modest.

One feels that Mr. Smith's abid»
ing hold on the periple will be in
his stories of southern lilc and
character. It was the ﬁeld of his
ﬁrst successful work, and notwltlr
slandingtlie interestofall hisread-
ings, one could not help feeling
that the sketch “Five Meals for a
Dollar” and that of the American
in Venice were almost cheap after

 

Colonel Carter. In this character
izntion Mr. sniiih was almost perr
feel. and while wanting the sane
guine tenderness of Mr. Cable's
"Bonaventure.“ it appealed to eve
ery listener by its kindly, simple.
chivalrous. openehearled hriinarr
ily. In the quality of humail syme
pathy Mr. smith is rich anti gens
uine, and his occasional caricatures
will not affect the permanent value
of such ﬁne work as Colonel Car-
ter, Tom Grogau and Caleb west

Glee Club andOrcl’iestra Concert,

On Saturday seats will go on
sale for the glee club and orches-
tra concert. This concert will
show the results of six months
hard practice on the part of these
organizations. The work done
by the club and orchestra in pre.
paring for this concert is not gen-
erally known. So soon as school
opens in the fall, the club begins
practising twice a week. increasing
the numberof rehearsals per week
as the date for the concert ape
proaclies until rehearsals become
daily. The orchestra also begins
work as soon as school opens,
working steadily fox six months,
that they may keep tip or add to
tliereputaiion of that organization.
To do this, the members have to
make many personal sacrifices.
and go to great inconvenience, as
nearly all are out of college and
have other duties to attend to.

Certainly the two organizations
are entitled to the best support
that the college and town can give
them as a reward for this hard
work. In return for-this support
they expect to give the ﬁnest con-
cert in a series of ﬁne concerts.
The club is stronger than ever be
fore, and have a very pleasing
program. There will be one or
two new fcaliires on this year's
program, whose novelty and mtk
sical quality will make them very
popular. Besidesthe regular pro-
gram, which is, of course, entirely
newI the club has a loiiglisl of
catchy encoles,aniorig them being
many local hits.

The work of the orchestra will
be at least up to its usual standard
if it does not suipass it, Ithas
been the policy of its director to
have the orchestra as good as
former ones, or not have any or-
chestra. During thespringreccss

 

the club and orchestra will take a
long trip, and the opinions of the
college and town people on the
home concert will be of material
assistance in arranging for the trip
program.

The social side of the home cone
certs is well known, and this cone
cert promises to be fully as brile
liant socially as any or its predee

cessors.

Ellis

The musical number of the
meeting on Friday afternoon was
kindly furnished by Miss Bobzln.
who graciously responded to hear»
ty applause witlia second num-
bei‘.

Grace Burton opened the pro
gram proper with a brief outline
of Kipling's life and works. in
this, Miss Burton’s ﬁrst appeare
ance before the society, she did
herself credit by her manner and
clear enumeration, thus proving
herself a worthy society member.
Anna Marsh read one of Kipling’s
short stories found in his Jungle
Book, which never fails to please
those who read it. From its reiie
diiion. it was clear that the read
er had entered fully into the spire
it of the story.

“Colonel Carter of Cartersville"
was reviewed by Mrs. Moody in
a most entertaining manner. The
principal characters, Col. Carter,
Chad and Miss Nancy. were clear.
ly brought before the minds of
those present, and they were thus
prepared to enjoy the cntertairle
merit of the cvcning more more
ougliiy.

The president read a iettcr from

Miss Ellis as the closing number
til the program, in which letter
she expressed her deep interest
in the society, and presented to
its members a picture of lierselr,
enlarged troni a recent photo-
graph. This picture is to replace
thevei-y pour one now hanging
In the hallI and is a source of
pride to every girl. Though so
far away, in Calriornia. Miss Ellis
never loses her interest in Iowa
College antl its work.
