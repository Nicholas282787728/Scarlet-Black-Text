Grinnelli Institute.

The ﬁrst numberot the program
last Wednesday evening was “Site
nation in the Transvaal,” given
by Arnold. The talk was are-
view of the progress ot tllc war
up to its plesent situation, and an
expression ot a tcw saltgtllnary
opinions as to its probable out-
come.

“The Paris Exposition,” a paper
by Frisbic, was one or the best
productions given upon the ﬂoor
this term. The subject was hanr
dled in a luctd and comprehensive
manner, and was very instructive
to one seeking inrormation upon
this particularstibjecl, Tile Paris
Expositions is one ot a series or

' World's Fairs, the ﬁrstof which

was given in 1851, and the last in
1893. The salient feature of the
World‘s Fair at ’93 was its magnir
rude; while that of 1900 will be
its artistic value Tile one radical
departure at Paiis will be the un~
derground railroads, built at a
cost of 513,000,000.

Dignan delivered the ﬁrst ora-
tion or the year. Hepleaoleol tor

of‘alalse. scheming nature, and
as a traitor to his country. jeffers
son Davis, though in the wlong.
perhaps, was nevertheless conr.
ageous enough to live up to his
conviction, and was withal a man
of clean character and noble as~
piratioris. The oration was elos
quent and tarcetul, and evinced a
disposition on the part ot the ora-
tor to help the man “who is un»
der.”

The extemporaneous work of
the eveningwasallotted as follows:
“Our Military Establishment in
Cuba,” by Geo. Arnold; “Judge
Taft of the Philippine Commis,”
by Trainor, Campbell extempty
raneously supported the negative
side ot the debate, as the regular

ispcalrersspolre exceptionally well.
Resolved, that a college cdttcar
ition is of more value to one cons
‘templatlng a commercial or nic-
chanical than the 57mm

method and mental discipline.
Statistics show that only one pel‘
cent of the total population are
college graduates. and yet 60 pﬁl‘
cent of the business ot the coullr
try is caiiied on by them.

The negative resolved the ques
tion into three topics: How to
get business at the least expense,
how‘to keep it, and how to so or
ganize it as to secure largest profs
its. A college education by its
very nature does not help one to
meet these questions, Each bus»
iness has details peculiar to itself,
which can only be leained by exs
perience. and the graduate is not
willing to begin at the bottom.
The speaker negated that the sta
tlstics proved anything whatever.
The men who Conductﬁo per cent
or the country's business are men
of native talent. who would be in
the same positions even without
the college education.

The evening‘s program closed
with two verylpleasillglnstluments
a1 renditions by Mr. Kendall.
