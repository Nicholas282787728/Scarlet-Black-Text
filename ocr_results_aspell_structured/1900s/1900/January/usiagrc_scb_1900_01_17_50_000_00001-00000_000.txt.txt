“Sweet Lavender,"

The ﬁrst public performance of
the Iowa College Dramatic Club,
given Saturday evening in the
chapel. was attended by a well-
pleased audience of 175 invited
guests. This being the maiden
effort of the club. and the seating
capacity of the chapel being made
decidedly smaller by the building
of an adequate stage, it seemed
advisableto limit the attendance
to the members ofthe faculty and
those interested ill a study of the
drama, and to the special friends
of thermembers of the club.

For their ﬁrst \vmk. the club
chosé a play lighter in character
and of more popular interest than
some which will be later underr
taken, and A. w. rinei-o's "Sweet
Lavender" was the one given.

Mi. Pinero is an English player
and playwiight, whose careful at-
tention to the details of dramatic
technique makes his plays espece
ially available ior amateur perfor-
mance: and “Sweet Lavender"was
given without alteration from its
published form. the proper ar-
rangements having been made
with Mr. Pinero’s American rep-
resentatives.

As to plot and situations in gen-
eral. the play is rather conven-
tional, but its defects in this di»
rection ale compensated for by
the author's skillful handling of
his materials, the delicate interr
mingling otpathos and hurnorand
the prevailing tone of cheerful-
ness that characterize the play,

The work of preparing a play
for presentation involves some
considerable difficulties; but the
Dramatic Club has this advantage
wthat its members are interested
in a serious study of thc contem~
porary drama, and are desirous of
making just and conscientious inr
terpretattoits of what they under-

 

take. This fact helps to explain
the large measure of success that
attended the giving of their ﬁrst
play. For the working out of
their parts the members were
obliged to depend upon theme
selves and each other largely,
their own efforts being supple
mented by the kindly assistance
which two or three members of
the faculty were able to give.

The outcome ivas encouraging.
Thosecngagingintheplayseemed
to have been selected with a view
to their adaptibility to their pare
ticular parts. and all carried them
with credit to themselves. each
showing some special elements of
excellence.

Mr. Owen, as Dick Phenyl. a
broken down barrister of good in-
tentions, but bibulous habits, was
the favorite character. He had
the part well in hand. showing an
attention to its details that is unr
usual in an amateur. Miss Phelps
played the part of the fond and
severe mamma with the proper
air, and becomingly allowed her
self to be managed by her daughr
ter Minnie, who showed much tact
insodoing. MissDenise.asMin-
nie, bore herself with dignity and
grace. appearing especially well
in her haughty and chilling de-
meanor towards Horace Bream,
the persistent American lover.
Mr. Waterman's counterfeit of
Bream‘s extravagances of expres»
sion and gush of manner was very
realistic. Miss Noel as “Sweet
Lavender,” the fair, timid, falters
ing maiden, won much merited
praise; and Mr. Otis as Clement
Hale, the ardent, youthful, dis~
tracted lover, deserves a word of
commendation torthe way he sus-
tained himself in a difﬁcult role.

The other parts. though of less
prominence, were properly per»
formed and merit further mention
did space permit. In brief. they
were as follows: Ruth Rolt,
house-keeper, the anxious mother
of Lavender, Miss Berry; Dr.
Deleney, a kind hearted, jovial
physician, Mr. Crosby; Weddcr-
burn. a hard hearted banker and
man of the world, as a bankrupt
and penitent, Mr. McCarty; Bul»
ger, the excitable hair dresser,
Mr. Meade; and Maw, a solicitor,
Mr, Arthur Risser.

All in all, though not a preten~

The Men’s Gymnasium.

For the beneﬁt of the alumni
and friends of the college who
have not seen the gymnasium just
dedicated, we take pleasure in
publishing the following descrip-
tion:

The building, which stands east
and west, is [15 feet long and 5in
ty»ﬁve feet wide outside of the
central transept, which has a width
of ﬁfty feet and a depth of ninety
ﬁve, projecting equally north and
south beyond the primary walls.
The walls are built of vitriﬁed
brick to the water-table, followed
by red pressed brick. A media]
line and the cornice are of term
cotia. The roof is of slate.

The main entrance is in the
center ot the south side, and is
ﬂanked by four pilasters. On the
north side is an entrance to the
basement intended for those coin-
ing directly from the athletic ﬁeld.

The basement, which is ten feet
high, is half below and half above
the ground. It is lighted by a row
of forty windows in the upper half
of the wall, The basement is dis
vided into two apartments by a
transverse wall. The west apart-
ment is 54x65 feet and contains
348 lockers so arranged as to give
convient passage to and from the
twenty bath rooms, built in a
double row near the center of the
apartment. Each bath room cons
tains a shower with appliances for
the independent regulation of the
temperature of the water.

The lockers are four and one-
half feet long and i5xi5 inches in
cross sections. They are supplied
with ventilating ducts so that air
entering them trom the room is
carried to the ﬁnes and out of the
building.

The walls of the basement are
of cement, while the floor of the
locker room is composed of ce-
ment and asbestos, which is as
smooth, hard and impervious to
water as marble, but not so cold
to the touch.

The cast apartment has space
for bowling alleys. a base ball
