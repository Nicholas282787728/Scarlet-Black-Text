A well rendered instrumental

solo by Miss Pearl Cessna opened
theaiternoon’s program, the re-
mainder of which consisted of
scenes from “The Little Minister”
with dialogue, under the manage-
mentofOlive Shockley. The pur»
pose was to present only such
scenes as would be thoroughly
representative of the book, and
the choices were certainly well
made. Alice Reed as Rob DOW.
and Ella Mehlin as the doctor are
especially worthy oi mention
among the minor characters.
Katherine Macy, as Babble. was
perhaps the most successful in
acting her part, although Lulu
Williams was nearly as snccesstul
in representing Gavin. The scene
in which Gavin and Babbie take
tea at Old Nannie’s cottage, in
whrch Anna Naih so well played
the part or Nannie, was best ap:
preciated by the audience: The
pathetic scene between Babble
and little Michael Dow, represent-
ed by Winifred Lea, was made
very touching, while the prettiest
scene was the one in which Bab~
bic tallrs with Gavin front the tree
top. Tire program closed with
the effective tableau of the gypsy
wedding,the weird and picturesque
effect of which was heightened by
the red light and the peals ot dis»
tant thunder. Miss Shockley des-
erves congratulations for the suc-
cess which attended her faithful

 

labors,

IOWA COLLEGE. GRINNELL. IOWA, SATURDAY, JANUARY 27, 1900.

 

Grinnell institute.

Grinncll Institute almost lost its
identity as a literary society last
Wednesday evening. The Juniors
took matters in hand,und,proinptr
ed bya desire to render something
new and entertaining, devoted a
large part of the program to inu-
sical number-s And, too, they
apparently took pride in the tuct
that this exhibition of varied and
high grade musical talent
given by indivtdnals strictly con—
ﬁned nrthin the bounds of its own
small Junior class.

Mr. Morton Macar-tney opened
the program with a \vellrrendered
vocal solo, which was heartrly ape
plauded by the society. A second
number was asked for, btit the
singer did not respond,

Mr. Dale McFarland next de»
livered a sad, touching eulogy
upon the death of Flex. The na»
lure of the fatal accident was ex»
plained,tlie sunny disposition of
the victim. his popularity,the gen-
uine sorrow felt by all who knew
ltimitlle wholesad story was pa-
thetically told, and not a dry eye
remained. Prex rvas Guy Snider’s
dog.

Mr. Gcorge E. Dolavan then
dispelled the gloom by playingon
his horn, and he dispelled it again
with an encore, which the audience
demanded,

The society was well pleased
with the two selections given by
Mr. Ed. Brande. Such [Music is
always appreciated, and all out-
siders who are willing to give such
to the society will receive the
warmest thanks and an urgent in-
vitation to come again.

Mr.H.F.Thonlpson then tickled
both the cars of the audience and
the strings ot the mandolin with
his pick, The selection was the
“Fortune Teller" waltzcs.

The question of the debate was
“Optimism versus Pessmllsm."
swan opened the afﬁrmative by
stating that man was by nature
social, and, as pessimism never
sought companionship, btit rather
solitude andgloonl, the social man
would be destroyed and which in
turn would unhingc the entire ma-
chinery of this social world, it pes-
simisln should hold full sway.
Snider denied the above state-
menlipessimism does not go to
such extremes as utter ostracism,

was

 

but rather keeps an eye open tor
all faults in order that they may
be rectiﬁed. Pessimism keeps in
vrcw abject poverty and extreme
opulence living side by side, and
lllt.’ problem to be solved ill this
connection, while optimism takes
everything as it comes and makes
the best ofit. For example, he
cited his dog; the animal was an
optimist and viewed the oncoming
trairrrrrperiectgoonlaith. Where
as, had he been a pessimist, he
would have attached some suspir
cion to the monster and stepped
out of the way. Every barking
dog which runs at the tail end of
a wagon is a pessimist. since he
recognizes certain ewls incident
to standing in front of it. Thtis
spoke the negatlve. .The iarr
young ladies, who had ventured
in and were chosen asjudges, gave
‘itheir decision tavor or
timism.

Miss Henderson, who, hear in
mind, is also a member of this
same small junior class. recited
“The Slow Race.” She llasapr
peured before the society twice
this year, and.both times has
shown talent and careful pl'epar}
tion. “The Slow Race" pleased
all. as did also Rllcy’s "Little
cripple Boy," which has given as
a hearty encore.

A trio of horn. mandolin and
piarroconcludcd the evening's perr
iormance, and a unanimous verr
dict was given that the Junior
class had succeeded in producing
a piogram both new and enter
taining.

The program began with the

roll call, each member responding
with a quotation liom Kipling,
and could 'l’enlininc voiccs be
strengthened a trifle this would
have bccn most enjoyable, for the
quotations, as many as could he
heard. were quite us characteristic
of their givers as of the author.

Mr. Macartriey llieir sang the
"Recesstonal" in an audience that
left nothing to he desired in the
way of appreciation,

The literary part of the program
consisted or a criticism ol Kipling
by Constance nerry. a review of
“'l‘hc Light that Failed.“ by Anne
Currie, and readings trom Kip-
ling's poems by Margaret Scam-
