THE MANAGER of the baseball
team informs us that satisfactory
arrangements have been made
with Si Ur 1. Their prompt disr
avowal of the acts of the S, U, I.
manager was sent, so soon as they

. learned of the trouble. We are
very glad that the athletic author-
ities at the University did not au—
thorize any such actions, and that
they were so prompt to inform us
of the facts in the matterr They
have shown beyond doubt that
they have nothing but friendly in-
tentions toward Grinnell, and that
they have no wish to cause any
hard feeling here. Two games
were arranged, an exhibition game
on May 2nd at Grinnell, and the
league game May 30th at Iowa
City.

WE wrsr—r to emphasize the need
at the active support of the Athr
letic Union by the students. The
Union has never been in a worse
condition than it is to-day, and
therefore, never needed such sup-
port as it doestoday, They have
a large debt on hand, with no very
good prospects of paying it, but
they are working hard in every
way to pay it. The apathy of the
students, in general, gives grave
cause for anxiety to anyone in-
terested in the athletics of the
schoolr Either they do not real-
ize the serious position the Union
is in, or they do not care. We
are not willing to confess as yet
that the latter alternative is true,
but at the present rate it will not
be long before we will be forced
to just such a confession. The
students have entire charge of the
athletic ﬁnances. and if we do not
pay this debt, what then? Sim-
ply that there will be no more
athletics in Iowa College, and the
reputation which has been built
up by hard work and sacriﬁces tor
many years will be lost, More
over, it can not be won back in
the same time it has taken US to
build it up. It is time that the

students realize where they are
drifting. There is not a student
in this college who cannot, in some
way, assist the Union, and it is to
their discredit, if not disgrace, if

they do not.
