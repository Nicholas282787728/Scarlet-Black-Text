As \vas’announced in the last
issue of SCARLET. AND BLACK, the
library is now open and lighted on
Monday, Tuesday. Wednesday
add Thursday evenings. trorn sev-
en until nine. The advantage of
this change is obvious to any who
are accustomed to make any con»
siderable use of the library. In
many instances whole classes have
been obliged to do outside read-
ing in one or two books which
could only be obtained in the lie
brary. Many times these books
would be drawn out by some per
son and retained for some time
through sheer neglect; As it is
now. plenty of time IS afforded all
to do this sort of reference work
in the library.

IN ANOTHER column will be
tound a copy of a paper which was
tendered to Mr. Herron at the
close ot his work Tuesday morn-
ing. This paper was originated in
Mr. Herron’s class and only those
who were taking his courses this
year were asked to sign it. The
fact that it met with the hearty
approval of all to whom it was
presented is indicative ot the high
regard in which Mr. Herron is
held by his students. Scauter

a word more should be said whlch
would more tully express the ap
preciation and respect which the
student body have for Mr. Herr
run than could a set of resolutions
coming trom the comparative few
who were taking his courses
True. the latter are the ones who
have had the best opportunity to
become fully acquainted with him
and are best ﬁtted tojudge him.
yet the entire student body feels
the inﬂuence which he has direct-
ly or indirectly had over it.
The simple presence of a man
ot such beauty of personality and
character, ot such nobility of am
and of such unselﬁsh devotion to
what he deems right must neces-
sarily have an immeasurcahle in~
Huence over any student body
And regardless oi belret, the stu
dents ﬁrmly believe that Mr. Hei-
ron has made a lastingimpresslon
upon the lives of those who have
been students during his work
with the college and has greatly
aided in making better and more
useful men and \vomenibetter
and more useiul citizens. We be-
lieve that we voice the general
sentiment when we repeatthe last
sentence at the resolutions pre
sented to Mr. l-Ierron. “Notwith—
standing the termination ot your
ofﬁcial connection with the insti-
tution, it is our hope that as occa-
siDn offers, the college may con-
tinue to enjoy the privilege of
your words and presence."

The following is the plan used
at Harvard for choosing the mem
bers of intercollegiate debating
team. Three trial debates or con~
tests are held. At the ﬁlst each
speaker is allowed ﬁve minutes.
and twelve men are chosen; at
the second each speaker is allow~

ed ten minutes and six men are
chosen: and at the third. which is
conducted the same as the inter-
collegiate debate. three men are
chosen to constitute the team.
