N unfortunate event is chrotr
iclccl on the front page.
which will surely bring disap-
pointment,not only to all Grinnell
supporters of athletics, but to
those of the State University as
well. Reference is made to the
cancellation of this year's Dual
Meet. Remembeting the long
athletic connection existing be-
tween these two institutions and
especially the friendly harmony
of the past few seasons, it seems
strange that an agreement could
not be reached upon the matter of
a date. The tacts detailed upon
the front page, however, seem to
tltrowsomelightupoirthis strange
ness, and, curiously enough, seem
also to give it a onersided hue.-
Contrary to custom and constitu
tional precedence, the Iowa Cit)
management proceeded to ﬁll all
her dates with other teams, 182th
ing'but one tor Grinnell, namely
May 4. which, without even con»
sulting ourtustes, was offered us an
alternative between that or irotlr
ing, Did the State University
management really expect Grinr
nell to sink her own interests and
knuckle clown to such a pier
emptory proposition as that? The
Gtinnell management, backed by
the Board of Control, by the stu-
dents and by this college paper,
refused the offered date and the
Meet was cancelled. The matter
of a week one way Or the other
may seem a trifling thing; btrt not
so to us for two reasons: First,
for the reasons cited in another
column; scconu, tor a principle.
Grinnell expects to be consulted
in matters pertaining to herself.
While SCARLET AND BLACK knows
full well that the students stand
behind the decision made at this

entl of the route, it doubts very
much that the move made at Iowa
City receives the thorough sup
port of the student body there.
Grrnnell doesn't claim any une
natural or bigoted rights, but
merely those which fairness would
dictate and friendship could not
deny.

A New Debating Union succeeds
the Old League.

The formation of the new Dc-
bating Union is an important event
in Grinneil debating history.
About ﬁve years ago a ferv oi the
members of the Chrcsto and Instir
tuie societies met and formed a
sort of league to conduct the inter
collegiate debates, This league
has elt-ed out a rather uncertain
existence ever since The presi-
dents of the two socicties have al-
ternatcly served as presiding ofﬁr
cer, some person by appointment
has usually acted as secretary and
treasurer, while
has

the necessary
usually been accmw
plished by committees. No i-cc-
ords have been ltept and there has
in fact_been no definite organizar
tron.

WOI It

Last fall a committee was up
pointed to suggest a suitable
form of organi ition; and. alter
careiul consideration, they sub
rnitted the new constitution which
was adopted at the meeting last
week. According to this constir
tution the membership of the De-
hating Union is made up ot all
regular members or the Chi-esio-
mathian Society and Grinnell In»
stitute; and the (our ofﬁcers, each
of whom alternate between the

two societies each year, together

arrangements for debate. Come
plcte provision is also made tor
the intersociety preliminary de-
bate. The question of judges for
this debate has been settled by
1d0)\mg the very successful sys-
tem of having seven judges to de
side the ﬁnal speakers anti three
jutloes (chosen by the debaters)
to decide the question. the new
