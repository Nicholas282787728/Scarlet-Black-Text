A STUDY IN POLITENESS.

Leander clark Basket Ball Team Shows
Superiority in Etiquette oiGai-iie.
Score, 78.23.

TlieG innell basketball team leit
the iloor alter the game last Saturday
night very downcast in heart. The
mere winning oi agarnecould not con-
sole them tor the deieat in good inan-
ners which the Toledo iive showed by
quietly standing by and saluting while
Grinnell men threw baskets by the
dozen.

Leander actually gave Grinnell ten
points as a handicap, very politely ab
staining irom touching the ball, Then
they begana show or good breeding
which lasted throughout the Lirst hair.
Several pretty maneuvers were exe-
cuted by them. They courtesied low
whenever Grinnell threw a basket and
towed lower every ten points.

One cute ligure they were especially
gracious in showing was a rosette
formed around their center while the
Grinnell men practiced goal throwing.
Twice the 'whistle blew to allow the
scorer time to patch up the blackboard
where he had rubbed holes in it add-
ing up Grinllell‘s score

The Scar-let and Black men couldn't
miss the basket. lIcIlratli actually
caromed one irom his opponent‘sﬂlend
into the goal and McEachrou threw
one irom back under the gallery.

Irishort the iii-st halt wasagame
or tag with Leander always It. The
team work and signal play oi Grinnell
bewildered lhedi United Brethren
and the hall ender .ll. In the sec.
ond two Grimiell subs iv nt in but
iailedtn get into it as hard as the
regulars. Also,Leander played harder
and held the score well down. Benson
was the Toledo star, getting ionr- oi
their- seven baskets and throwing
seven iouls out oi eight t ls. The
Grinucll team iouled badly, though
the’ play was not laugh.

every Sunday at the organ were sure
oI a musical treat 01' no ordinary kind,
and they were not disappointed. Mr.
Scheve's mastery or his noble instru-
ment was never more admirably
shown than in lastevening's program.
The Boellmann Suite which opened
the program oﬂ'ered Opportunity for
every variety or organ expression,
Irom the delicate harmony of the
Minuet to the stately Prayer and the
brilliant Toccata. The Grieg Noctur—
no was a marvel oI descriptive Ietliug,
asquietiy tender as the Prelude and
Fugue was magniﬁcent, a series or
startlingchords and intricate passages
of greatdilliculty and beauty. Livery

Mrs. Schere's lirst number won the
regard or her audience, and each Sui;-
