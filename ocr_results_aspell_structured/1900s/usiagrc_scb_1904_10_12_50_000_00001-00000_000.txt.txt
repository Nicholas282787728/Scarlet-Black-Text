numbers of

terhoon and evening,

These were the opening
the Y. M. c. A. lectnrc
the management is L0 be congratulat-

course, and

ed upon so auspicious a beginning.
The singing of the Madrigal Club

was noteworthy for precision oi at-

trick. excellent phrasing, and liarnroir

ions blending of Voices. It is L0 be

criticized for a somewhat too rigid

tempo, Iir many. iI irot most, of their

numbers a tubitto interpretation

would have been more satisfying. ‘ In
the singing oi “Sweet and Low” Mr.
Clippiuger is to be criticized to intro
ducing a siercandneu‘ect, which was
totally out or harmony with an other--
wise excellent conception. Eilects oi
such a nature rei-y oiten are more ec-
centric than artistic, and this wasa
case in point.

its a whole the evening program
was much better than the matinee,
The best irumbers by the club were
“Wake to the Hunting," “May
Dreams" and Arthur Dunhztm‘s mad-
rigal, “What the Chimney Sang."
Mr, Dilnhltln‘s composition is a rt»
markable piece of work, and the club’s
singing of it calls for the warmest
commendation. Sullivan’s “OGladr
some Lig’iit,”sung as air encore, was
excellently done.

Mr. Campbell’s singing was well re-
ceived. He has a very sweet baritone
voice which he handles with good
taste.

lilr.Leon Marx, the violinist, was
much enjoyed. His playing is trechr
nically nawless, and he draws a warm
sweet lone from his instrument. In
oneor two selections he was liaiiip
ered somewhat by a tardy accompani—
ment, though in the Mendelssohn coo-
certo Miss Scott’s playing was excel-
lent. It is to be hoped that Mr. Mai it
may give an,entn-e recital in Grinncll.

Miss Scott, the planisl, was partic-
ularly pleasing in her handling of itub-
instein's Staocato Etude. liei- touch
anti wrist technique are much to be
admired.

Altogether the impression left by

the Madrigal Club and its soloists was
very pleasant. Some of the music oi

the club was trivial, but what was
worthy was sung in an unaircstion.
ably worthy manner. It is to be hoped
that the club may give another cou—
certin Grinllell. D.L.s,

The Senior Club will meet with
Adah Hopkins Saturday night.

Numbersmav be drawn at Alley’s to
reserve seats for the IIillis Lecture on
the Y. M. c. A. course all day sirt-
urdiry and upic Monday noon. Seats
will be reserved at 1 o. in. Monday.

GAME ENDS A TE.

Neither Cornell Nor town College Able to
Win in Saturday’s Contest—Meth-
odists Excel in First Half.

Like all contests in which a tie score
results. the recent CornelerrlnIlell
game was notably unsatisfactory. Up
on such occasions the universal rrile is
l’or each side to regard the contest as
a virtual victory ior itself and make
outaclear case of hard lrrck in the
press dispatches. Although to Share
L i .rwn BLACK this con ~e seems to
oilt unusual opportuni ies in the
present case: we will bow to the de
cisionol'tlie Fates and say that the
score was ,a fair measure of the
strength of the opposing eleveiis,
(il'lllntill’s' i iluie to make a better
n‘lltlwiilu against the visitors may be
attributed to two cause the unex-
pected str-engtliof the visiting team,
and tlrerroerul lack of ﬁnished play
displayed by the locals. Cornell put
upon the tield a team containing such
veteran players its Moore, Nelson,
Teri ill and Irwin, and one which was
far tilleilfl OI the locals in point of de~
velopinent. This superiority was evi-
dent throughout the contest although
Grinnell’s offensive play strengthened
noticeably in the second half.

Cornell had the‘ better-jot the argu-
tncnt throughout the ﬁrstlralf. Grln~
ncll received the kick otf and was
donned without return. End runs
and tlietackle back plays netted con-
sistent gains and the ball was taken
to Cornell‘s lo yard line in a fewglays.
Here the Purple took the ball on owns
and settled down to a steady hammer-
ing or the tackle positions which prov-
ed nn enigma to the localeleven. Grin-
nell iinally hcld but was iiirmediately
forced to print and Cornell with the
bestolicnsivc play of the day, carried
the ball rapidly to within a foot or
the Gi-iniiellgoal. Here the scarlet
and black mad . gallant stand and
held the Methodists twice without
advance. 0n the tin d down Moor-c
pushed the ball bare ver the chalk
and the score stood Cornell 5, Griunell
tl. Cornell failed at goal. Time of
plirv 18 minutes. During the reinai r
tle oi the lialiLthe ball moved contin-
rurllyup and down the ﬁeld, neither
team getting within striking distance
or the coveted goal. Time was called
with the ball in midﬁeld.

Tire second half lvds Grinneil’s from
start to iii . . Gilley l, clied off arid
the ball soon went toGii rell on a
punt, Bdrbcrd'splaced wi y at end;
nuraclrer, Mclx’ain at tackle; and No
tile assumed the quarter position.
Under the stimulus of the shake-up,
the scarlet and black eleven work
ed swii'tly down the ﬁeld, straight
back find the trickle back formations
doing most oi the work, Gilley was
sent or r fora touch ownin about
ten minutes. to was given the prillir
loge oi converting his orvir touchdown
into a goal, but the hick went low and
the victory wasleft in the balance.
The play during the remainder- of the
lurlf was furious upon both sides but
with Gl'inllull always slrowingup in
the rosier lrtie. At one time Grinnell
secured the ball upon her own yard
line and took it without a reverse to
Coiireil’s 15. Here 1\ heavy penalty
was incurred, brit a misunderstanding
led Noble to abandon the chance for a
tield goal and Shilllett was giventhe
bitli. Ilc made a magnificent try but
was downed by Slack when he had
made all butaicw inches of the res
quii-cd distance and Grinnell’sl t
chance ioraseorc was lost. The r-
iiurinder of the game was uneventful
and the contest ended with the score,
it innell 5, Cornell ii.

For Gi-uiiiell, Siiililct, Gilley aird
Iiltramaster wore the star pertoimcrs

could be aired tor. N hie, harbor
