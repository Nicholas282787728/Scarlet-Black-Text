COLLEGE SPIRIT AS SHOWN BY
THE WOMEN OF IOWA
COLLEGE,

Iowa College may well be proud or
the way in which its ivomeii have ale
ways taken part in every phase or col-
lege lite and have loyally supported
every kind oicollcge activity. It they
have not been able to play iootball
themselves, they haye gone to the
games and have inspired the players
with thatenthusiasrn and determin-
ation to win which, in at least one
famous instance, saved the day. And
members oi visiting teams have been
known to wish that the girls or their
sohoolscould or would root the way
the Grinnell girls can and do.

However, they do not stop ivitlr be-
ing enthusiastic at the games. When,
a year ago last tell, their college pride
Was lirrrt by the shabby appearance oi
the iootball players on the iield, the
girls held an indignation meeting and
later proceeded to iurnish the funds

since it was out or the question ior the
Athletic Union to provide them.

The largeoroivds at the basket ball
games this year have been irequently
spoken oi, and are very gratiiying. we
are told. to the management. These
crowds, it is needless to say, are large—
ly due to the interest taken in this
game by the women at the school, and
so it is with iield meets and all other
ior-ms oi athletics. They mrrsthaye
tliesupport or the women and they

But athletics ' not the only college
activity which elaiirrs the interest or
the women. The hundred girls or
more who r'yent to the debate at Mt.

In the tall or the iollowing year,
1591, the college secured the use oi the
Armory, and the classes were again
taken up under the charge oi Miss

at Harrard under Dr. Sargent. At
this time the work was purely option-
al, two hours each week being open to
the women’ as beiore. The work was
carried on by Miss Itrngheirn until the
iall oi 1393 when Miss [land was elect-
ed to the position or “Instructor in
Social and Physical Culture.” 1t was
at this time that lb was iound neces-
sary to reorganize the department or

THE COE GAME

The basket ball team returned Snri-,

they srrcceeded in deieating Coe Col-
lege io the trine oidl to it The game
was last throughout, and it was only
alter in minutes oi the hardest lr'illili

iloor victors. The Coe men showed u:
marked improvement siirce the iirst:
game between the two schools, their
team \\Ol‘l( being inst and at times
hard to break up.

The game started with a rush, both
Learns scoring within a miiiirtc or trio.
It was during the hit liali that Grin-
nell srrcceeded in scoring mostor her
baskets. Beldeu did all the pointl
making during this hair, securing
eight h‘e‘rl goals and one dial.» The
score read 17 to 12 iii l‘ul'or oi the
scarlet and black when a recess was
called.

The second lrali went decidedly in

in equalling the score oi their oppon-

A
noticeable ieatire or the grime was

Iowe College play a very important
part in all of Llle College life and ac-
tivities: [or what would Griunellbe
without its men’s athletics, its Y. M.

parties with their respective youth-

First ofilll in connection with this
snbyeot, it is interesting to look back
over the reports and see how the coin—
pm‘ative number of men and women
has varied irom year to year.

If one wishes to go back as far as
1853 it may be seen by the report of
this year that out of the 109 Students
not a single one could be ioiiiid repre-
senting: the “fairer sex ”

In 1862 63 the young men still had a
majority or ﬂity to tlrirt l-seven.
However as the years have passed the
young women oi the college have
gradually been asserting [hell‘sbiength
