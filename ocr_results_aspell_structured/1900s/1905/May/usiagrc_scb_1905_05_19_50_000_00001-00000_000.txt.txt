GRINNELL ’1 CORNELL r.

Iowa College Takes rhe First League
Game M Home. Eleven innings
of Good Bill].

After eleven innings oi as clean base
ball as has been seen in late years on
the Ward ﬁeld diamond, Griiinell
walked bit the grounds last Saturday
the victor over Cornell College by a
score oi 2 to 1. The game was as
excrbingzs the score would indicate
though played in a muddy diamond
and it wnsamagnihcantpitchers bat—
tleirom start to ﬁnish, neither Smith-
son nor Kagoii having the better oi
the argument, Both pitched superb
ball and received creditable support.
1-! strike outs are credited to Smitlie
son and 12 to Ragon, while the latter
allowed uota base on balls and kept
each oi Grinnell‘s ﬁve hits well scat»
tered except during the eleventh
when Valerius singled, Morgan reachr
ed ﬁrst on an error and Davis brought
the scarlet and black catcher home
with the winning run. The game
closed with none out and" two on
bases.

Cornell’s lone score came in the
third inningas a generous giit irom
Smithson during the one minute oi
the game in which that gentleman
was not master of the situation. Bry-
ant. was the lirst up for the Method-
ists in this round. He helped himseli
to a single, Moore followed and a
pitched ball hit him. Miller scored
another hit and with the bases thus
iilled Iiayes drew a iree pass and
iorced in the visitors tally. Aiter
this they were at no time dangerous.

Grinnell tied the score in the eighth
with one man out. Brundage hit safe
and reached third in time to score on
the passed ball that sent Braskamp to
ﬁrst. In the matteror errors Grinnell
made altogether the better showing.
Her total was three against six ior the
opponents.

GRINNELL LOSES,

The Iowa City high school won
the debate with Grinnell high scllnnl
at IowaCiDy last Friday. Grinnell‘s de-
baters iarored government control or
ireight rates and while handling their
side in a most commendable manner
were evidently inferior to their more
experienced opponents Conlter,
who led the Iowa City team, is said
none ofcollege caliber in every way
as a debuter. The judges were 0. E.
Vance and C. 11. Carson oi Marengo
(ind Editor Ritthbun of Marion and
their decision was unanimous in favor
or Iowa City. Superintendent Thorn-
burg and Principal T. H. Ziegler ac-
companied the boys and report good
treatment from their hosts. The
Iowa Ci ten speaks highly oi the re.
buttal of Manson of Gl‘innell.

VICTORY AND BONF‘IRES.
Grinnell Wins Annual Dual Meal Wirh
Drake by the Comfortable Score of
73 ro 58—The celebration.

On Saturday last the Iowa College

G, track team won the second dual meeL

citho season by deieating Drake to
the tune oi is to as. The day was by
no means irleal iora iielrl meet. The
track was rather heavy and the ﬁeld
soggy irom the heavy rains, and the
hundred yard dash was started ina
shower. This was all the rain that
materialized lint the air was raw and
over-coats were not uncomioitable
in the grand-stand. otherwise from
the grandstand point or view oi a
orinnellite the meet could hardly
have been bettered, Few 'events
were certain and ior the lirst part or
the meet the scores were close enough
to be exciting. Grinnell gradually
accumulating a safe margin. Corr
sidering tiic weather conditions all oi
the records were creditable, Cona-
Way’s shot put oi 40 teens inches be-
ing especially noteworthy.

T119100 yard dash was one oithe
closest events or the day. nuti win.
nlng from Scarr by a foot and Ca):-
tain Templeton taking a close third
The pole vault was not contested,
Drake being given the two best posi-
tions ior vaults oi S iect. The Mc-
Ilrath brothers were our point win-
ners in the mile.taliing lirst and third.
MnKenne, who was counted on to take
the discus, was notiii his usual term
and the erent went to Kiotz o1 Drake
with a throw oi only 113 iect. None
oi the Drake men were able to hurry
Clow in the hurdles, who took both
in rather slow time. In the high
jump Tilton took iirst at o ieet 2
inches and Wilder second, with Stock-
ham (D) third.‘The quarter was 'a
sprint irom the start and but tor the
heavy tracinwould have gone in mm
time. McKeilile tied Conawey atio
ieetl inch in the shot put, ioicing
the big Drake man to put it out to 40
iccts inches. Boyd did 21 ieet 3)
inches in the broad Jump, a mark
which Williams, with a record oi‘23
icct, was not able to better.

The hall proved to be a clean sweep
ichrinnell and min was not’ pushed
in the 220 yard dash, winning in the
last time 01‘ o. Honors were divid-
ed in the relay, the bait mile going
to Drakein 1:34 and the mile being
Grinnelrs all the way by a good mar-
gin. Marvin set a pace in the two
mile that soon developed a string out
and won it handily with Hensleigh
(D) second and Barnard (G) third.

The defeat oi the winners oi last
year’s State Meet. was deemed worthy
oia celebration and in the evening
preparations were made accordingly.
but the pouring rain made a bonﬁre
out or the question. A crowd oi en.
tlmsiastic students, however. gather.
ed on the porch oi Blair nail and suc-
cessiuliy overcame the dispir ing in.
iiuence oi the weather with yells and
speeches, ﬁnally adjouruing the meet-
ing until Monday evening when the
eagle was to scream in earnest.

The areajust north of the heating
plant was selected as the place ior the
bonﬁre. Supt. Triplett donated the
old cottage sidewalks and merchants
oi Grinnell generously contributed
boxes so that at 3:30 the match was
applied to a veritable mountain oi
oil-soared pine and the scenes which
ioilowcd will be long remembered.
As iast as they could be captured
membeis or the iaculty and track and
base bull teams were placed on a large
dry—goods box irom which they do-
livererlspeeclies. Proiessors Main,Fink
Hendrixson, Stoops, Smith and Trip»
lett spoke tor the faculty, Messrs.
llaines and Ziegler tor the alumni,

and but. few members of tho athletic
teams escaped being escorted up iront.
The Speakers were unanimous in their
praise of the WDl’k of Coach Fisher, to
whose policy and industry the victor»
les were due, and the sentiments mosti
warmly applauded by the student
body were those complimentary to
him. Altogether the occasion was one
of bile most. refreshing that. has taken
place on Iowa College campus for

 

many a day.
