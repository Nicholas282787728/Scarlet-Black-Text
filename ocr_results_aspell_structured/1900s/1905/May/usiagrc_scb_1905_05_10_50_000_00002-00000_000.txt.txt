the Iowa College campus; in

interesting suggestion has been made
by a member oi the iaculty proposing

removed. The college might he will-

be favorably entertained by {l large
number oi students. Is the iaeulty
as desirous to rid the campus of a de-
structive post?

label bhemselves Christian and men
who declare [heinselles to be followers
of The CliiisL are on [rill].
