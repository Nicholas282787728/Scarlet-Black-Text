THE IOWA GAME.

iowa Won Friday Through Errors in
The FirsrrA clean Exhi-
bition orherwisc.

At ten o'clock Friday morning um»
pire Parsons gave the Call, “play ball.”
and the big game between Grinnell
and herold rival, S. U. I., wason.
Inning number one proved to be
one of disaster for Grinnell. When
the iireworks had stopped and the
.s m o k a had cleared a w a y, the
score hoard showed a start of four
scores for the old gold. Poor control on
the part oi Smithson, three passed
balls, together with errors at ﬁrst and
second tell thestory oiabad beginning.

Alter the ﬁrst inning the scarlet
and black pulled together and proved
itseli capable 'oi playing good ball.
Smithson held Iowa at his mercy and
at no time were the opposing batters
able to connect with Sphere in any
dangerous manner. A record of six
Strikeouts and having allowed only
two hits, is sulﬂcieub (,0 show that the
little soubhoawed Grinnellite kept
the wearers of the old gold very busy.

Cretameyer who did the twirling ior
Iowa, pitched good ball throughout

_ but it ‘was‘o’nly through almost brilli~
nub ﬁelding that Giinnell was held L0
two hits. Only two strikeouts were
accredited to the Iowa man. Iowa
securcd her ﬁlth score in the seventh
inning when a long liy was driven out
over leit ﬁeld, scoring a man irom
second.

The two teams meet again on the
home ﬁeld May BI and a, fast game can
rightly beexpected.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY. MAY 20,

NEW CONSTITUTION ADOPTED.

The Debating Union has been Re-organ-
ized and Placed on a Sounder
Basis.

several months has at last been ans
complisned. At the meeting oi the
Institute and Chrcstomathian soc‘i-
etles Wednesday evening, a new con»

The most serious defect in the old

stitute, two irorn Chrestomathia
and two inculty members. Provision
has been made for permitting the
Lewis Literary society to havea mem-
her on this committee but no action
has been taken as yet by the latter
society. It is especially desired that
both thc dcoa ' rest oi the col»
loge and academy he placed under one
management so that there may he co-
operation in all' departments. The
matter however, will be leit entirely
to the descretiou oi' the academy so-
ciety.

The constitution also provides ior a
general assembly consisting or the
members oi both societies to which
the executive is responsible. At the
request or ten members, a general as
sembly can be called, and the powers
of the committee can be taken over
by a general assembly.

The committee has been elected and
will consist oi the icllowing members:
W. A. Williams and Ii, I. Worth oi
the Institute, ii. I]. Wlieaion and E.

ciety and Proicssor Macy and Pro-
fessor Ryan of the faculty. Tile com-
mittee met on Thursday and elected
oilicers ior the year: President, II,

Carney: Secretary, 11. 1. Worth: Treas-
urer, w. A. Williams.

THE ACADEMY WINS.

The Lewis Literary Society Secures D:-
cision over Morningside. Liis are
now Stale Champions,

Thursday evening the Lewis Liter-‘
cry Society added another to its long
list or debating victories. Morning-
side Academy suliercd deieat at the
hands oi Grinnell debaters. The ques-
tion ior discusssion was: Resolved that
immigration into the United States
should be restricted to those who can
read and write the United States Coo-
stitution in some language, with the
condition that those dependent upon
qualiﬁed emigrants should not be con-
sidered. 'Mr. Irnrt, Principal oi the
Oslraloosa High School; Prciessor
iiorrison, oi Penn College and Pro-
iessor Gordon, oi the University oi
Iowa, were secured as judges,

All six oi the debaters were in their
ﬁrst contest. Considering this fact
there was shown a great deal of abil-
ity on the part or each one, and there
was also evidence oi hard work. Kin~
lay, the leader oi the Grinnoll team,
is a Senior Academy student. a nd
Fawkes and Stanton, the other two
members of the team, are in their
ﬁrst year. The Grinnell boys support
ed the aliirmatlvc, contending that
illiterate ioreigners should be exclude
ed because, 1st. They injure Ameri-
can labor; 2nd. They are a menace
toAmerlcan iustituticns; 3rd. They
add to a class already a social burden.

Morningside, upholding the nega-
tive, argued against the application
or the literacy test to immigrants be
cause, 1st. It is not a true test or ﬁt-
ness; 2nd. Our industrial growth de-
mands the immigrant; 3rd. He is
not a detriment socially.

Kinsley supported the ailirmative‘s
ﬁrst proposition, showing that at
present. we have no need oi the illiter-
ate immigrant, and that when admit-
ted his competition makes necessary
a lower plane oi living ior the Ameri.
can laborer. Hamilton, the‘lcadcr oi
the ilorningside team, contended that
the literacy test is incliicient because
it shows neither the intelligence, abilr
ity nor character oi the immigrant,
Fawkes argued the anirrnative's sec.
end point, rhattlie illiterate iorcigner
is a menace to American institutions
because he lacks the requirements oi
citizenship. and ii reiused this privi-
lege would form a class of Subjects, a
state or amiirs directly opposed to
republican principles,

Johnson maintained our economic
need or the illiterate immigrants.
Since no other laborers will consent
to do such work as mining, these must
be admitted. Wrongsocial conditions
are not caused by the illiterate ior-
eigner, but by our economic.system;

consequently the need is not exclusion
oi the immigrant, but reiorm oi the
system. The third point oi the amino—
ativewos upheld by Stantonon the
grounds that the illiterate foreigner

settles in the slum, forming a class
