lection the \thle institution will
share with them a greater glory than
ever before. Victory this Lillie means
an honorable ohiiniuioiishlp or a Si roug
debating league, and as a consequence
a signiﬁcant prestige will crime to the
Iowa College Academy. But ivlietlier
We are to Win or lose let us show 1.0

r) now as to the prospects (or
[or State lleet. For the ﬁrst
timoiu live years Grinnell has won
recognition as a serious motor in the
great athletic carnival oi the year.

 

There are those. in root. ivlioean see a
posslb (y for El Ln‘ltllcl luwu College

clays about ivhi. i grlﬂuzltee or recent
years are [and or telling us, and
‘iViHlmlti unwarranted assurance it
may be stated that iiist place [or
Grinnell is entirely within the range
or possibilities, however unreasonable
it may be to expect that result

The OllLlook presents one elemental
certainty: TluitGi-iiiuell willgire good
account; oi herself at Des Noines on
May .i. This Situation of collzse calls
[or loyalty in proportion and it goes
without 521; ug that loyalty is best
expressed by personal encouragement.
And persona] encouragement is to
have its best eileet only on the rlay oi
the meet. The Grillnell section of Lhe
grand stand has had as glorious a past
