THE SEAsoN AS VIEWED BY
“DOC" HARRIS.

Tire iootball season Just closed at
iei-ds Grinnell alumni much ground
ior jubilation. It has had its detects.
therehavebeensomedisdppointments,
but the sum total or results achieved
have been more than the most hopeiul
could have anticipated.

The questions most naturally aslred
are: “What, did no do and where did
we land?” slimming it up brierly. we
doieated cor. Penn, Cornell, Simpson,
Drake. tied Des Names in the ﬁrst
game or the season and met tleierrt our
ly attire hands oi the elevens ironr
Iowa and nines, ii one inclines too
much to retrospecticn such a record
may not seem ilattering, icr in the old-
rlen day rictoiies over Minnesota,
Iowa, Xeblaska and Amcs were re.
garded as nothing unusual. We must,
however, recognize thatsiieli a day has
ilown, probably never to return, until
some philanthropist swells our enroll-
ment via the big endowment route
Even had we deieated Dralre the rev
suit achieved had been very satisiac.
tory icr a team so largely made up of
green material. The victory over the
Christians, with‘tlieir superior weight
and abundance ofexperienced material
was the brightest spot on the schedule
and one ior which the team of inns
will long he called blessed.

A rew words regarding the Iowa and
runes games are not amiss since many
seem to ieel that in them Grinnell rell
iar short of what might reasonably
have been expected. As regards the
temper contest, the record oi the
IIawlreye eleven during the month ol
November is surricienr explanation.
Despite crushing deieats at the hands
picnicago and Minnesota, Iowa doubt-
less had the strongest eleven she has
put in tiie held since 1900. Grinneil
met the old gold when its stoclr was on
the rise and was simply over-matched
in both weight and experience.

Emerging irom the Iowa game in a
battered condition Grinnell, deprived
oi its two pivotal derensive players,
the tackles, encountered the Watson-
trained men irom Ames the iollowing
Saturday. And while our deiense was
ragged, it was at all times courageous
and such as to arouse the admiration
oi any “old grad” iamiliar with the ill-
balanced condition. Incidentally it
may besuid that Grinnell men were
not the only ielloivs who called ior
time.

There are ta-o other matters quite
as important as the rally sheet; the
spiritor rair play inaniiested by error
Ile'il crowds this iall, and the team’s

physical condition. To one who has
voiced his protest in season and out
against rowdy talk and rowdy conduct
on oursidelincs, it was indeed a pleas»
are in the three games witnessed} to

note that we have astudeut body that

 

ls well versed in tile fundamentals or
good sport. There were, or course, a
row individual exceprions to llie rule,
but they were never llagi-aiit. Asa
provision against the iuture let me aslr
what objection could be raised to the
organization or a strident vigilance
committee designed L0 inculcate the
principles oi clean sport in the brains
or such oileriders, either by the soit
arts oi persuasion or by such other
methods as virile minds and siuewy
limbs might devise and execute.

At a time when the entire country
is stirred by the hue and cry against
the alleged brutality of football it is
refreshing to contemplate the record
or almost uniformly good physical con-
dition presented byGrinnell teainsior
the past si. years, In the rail or 1599
Mr. John P. Watson came to Grinnell
as the ﬁrst trainer of our elevens. His
methods, at iirst regarded with misA
giving. soon met with complete ap-
proval, Tile same methods have given
the Aures teams or marl and 1905 a free-
dom irom injuries not exceeded even
by the pupils or Keene F 'Ipilfrl'ick,
Michigan's venerable trainer. Since
Mr. Watson’s departure the physical
weliare or the team has been most ably
guarded by Trainer Fisher, a pupil oi
the craiiy Scotclnrian. Ilow well he
has exempliﬁed ilie teaching of his
preceptor, the record or the past two
seasons tells, The “hospital squad”
has been a rare bird yvith us. Why?
Simply because we have a physical die
rector intelligent enough to know
when his men have had enough worlr,
Give us a row inn- coaches and train
ers who can reali that men are men,
not horses, and there will be iar less
talk about the brutality oi ioorball.

Coach Flake faced a hurt] proposition
at the opening or the season. The
material was iai- ~ abundant birt
green. Furthermore it had to be
whippedintoioi-ineary, His labors
were materially lightened for a iew
weeks by Mr. Bel'gen’s presence: but
aside hour that he has had practically
no assistance. The team demonstrat-
ed at the conclusion or the season that
it had not oulya good knowledge or
the iundamentals or the game, but
showed a marlred versatility in attack.
We believe captain Bleamaster and
his warriors may hope ior even better
things in 1901i. 0, E. Iiarnrrs loo.
