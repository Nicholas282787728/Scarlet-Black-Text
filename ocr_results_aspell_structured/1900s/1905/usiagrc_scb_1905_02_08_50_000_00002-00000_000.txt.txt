(ﬁhituciul

BLACK that the oration submitted by
Lila representatiie at Cornell to the
judges on thought and composition [or
the State contest bears the ,. .ne title
IlSdld the winning production atlasl
yelu"s contest. A little inquiry on the
p'u't otsorne interested Grinneli people
has revealed the ract that the oration
not only bears tiie same title as Mr,
Clark's or last year but it is practically
the same oration. Moreover its ml-
tbor is none other than Mr. Fred J.
Clarit himself,

So tar as the knowledge of SCARLET
AND BLACK goes, Dotti. Comment On
this coincidence has appeared in the
college press ofLiie state and yet. it is
too much to assume tliatitlias gone
unnoticed or that it receives tiie sauc-
tion or the average obserrer in the stir-
dent ranl Granting that no rule or
ists in the constitution oi the state
association to bar the entrance oia
winning production lorasecond con-
test several reasons migliL be mentloiit

seems instilled and there areagood
