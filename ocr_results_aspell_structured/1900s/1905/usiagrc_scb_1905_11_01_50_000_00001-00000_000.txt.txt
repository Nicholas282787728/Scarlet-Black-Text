THAT IOWA GAME.

Grinnell will Make a Strchuous Eriori
to Deieat the old Gold. Low
Rate Secured ior the Trip.

The question uppermost in the
minds oi the iaithiul this week i.,
uCari Griilnell beat Iowa?" Twelve
lcngyearslraie p. ‘SCKi since the Old
Gold was humbled in the dust by the
Scarlet and Black and although we
tied them in lots, yet victory has
never perched on Grillilell standards
since the days or '93. Time and again
have our valiant warriors journeyed
to Iowa City only to return with bruis-
ed bodies and in an unhappy state or
mind, In 1901, we were conﬁdent oi
success but our coniidence was shat.
tered by the tune of 11 to 11. Again
we had hopes in 1903, only to see them
blasted on Ward Field by a score or Ii
to 0. Thus have the rates or rather-
tiiie better team been against us.

Once again the unexpected victory
over Drake and the magniiicent show-
ing or our team have given Grlnuell
motel-s reasons to feel hopeful. The
team at present is in excellent shape
and all theiniuredwiillrave rounded in
ooiorm by Saturday, Coach Flske assist
ed by various alumni is iollowing the
tactics c‘i Bergen and the team is play-
ing an excellent article or ball. Grinr
nell is going to win btit ii they lose, it
will be because Iowa has the better
team and therefore deserves the vice
tory. There is little chance ior com-
parison and the superiority oi either
will only be demonstrated aiter aliard
struggle. Iowa expects to win and by
a large score. The team has improved
wonderiully since the earlier games
and as the Normal game was a light
one, the wearers oi the Old Gold will
bein ﬁrst class shape to meet Grin-
nell. The Iowa team will have the
advantage in weight.

It is expected that a large number
of Grinireil rootei-s will accompany the
team and arrangements are
made wrtli that ldettm View. A low
rate of 6 all 101’ [Le round trip has
been secured provided tivo hundred

evening pa user will be liul/l at
Iowa UlLy until alter the game so
that ever-y one can reach Grinnell
again by in that evening. Tlicticlc

The admission to the game will be
titty cents ior gentlemen: twenty iii-e
cents ior ladies and children, Grand
stand tree to all. This isatriptvhrclr
no one can aliord to miss and the low
rate ought to make it possible ior
every Grinnell student to accompany
the team and cheer them to victory or-
to comiort them in dereat. The team
needs you; the college needs you; you
need to go. It will be the best game
in Iowa this season.

DR. BRADLEY is INSTALLATION.

Dr. Steiner Writes Concerning the Ser.
vices Held at Pilgrim Church,
Cleveland last Tuesday.

"Two men met on 'i'uesda , October-
zith, irrtlre lobby or the IIollenden
llotel in Cleveland, Ohio, and the one
said tothe other beiore a word at
greeting was exchanged: “Do you
know that we beat Drake?” The
other mansaid “glory.“ Itisnced-
less to say that the ﬁrst speaker was
Dr. Bradley, and the man who so
piously ejaculated was the delegate or
Iowa College to the council which
was to install Dr, Bradley as pastor oi
Pilgrim church. The iact ls,that the
man who thus enthusiastically receiv-
ed the riews or a iootball victory, had
been away iroru home and had had
much time and opportunityto muse
about the evils oi the game as it'is
now played, but when the home team
wins, the game does not seem hali so
bad as it really is.

At two o’clock that aiternoon the
Iowa College delegate addressed a
noble company or women, members of
the Mothers Club or Pilgrim olrurch,
composed oi Catholics, Jews, Slavs,
Greeks, and what not;a iair reprev
sentation oi the constituency oi
that church which is regarded as one
oi the most useiul in our whole
Congregational iellowship. A glimpse
oi the new home oi Dr. and Mrs.
Bradley was also vouchsaied.

The students oi Iowa College will
be glad to linow that they are Com-
iortahly located within two squares oi
the church in arelatively small, but
beautiiui home which bears the
marks oi that comiort and good taste
which betray the spirit oi its mis-
tress.

The loving cup presented by the
students has a conspicuous place on
the piano and does not yet their any
serious signs oi wear.

become so popular that, it became
necessary to seek larger quarters J usb
at this time, the citizens or Grinnell
became interested in the undertaking
and met the appeal oi the tounders
