The marriage of Miss Sullivan, the
teacher and companion of the blind
girl, Helen Keller, to a Harvard pro-
icssor was recently announced and
connected with it is a charming little
episode. During Miss lieller's college
days Miss Sullivan has been her con.
stall: companion, and it was during
this time that she met and loved the
Professor.

.\s the story runs the Prorcsscr pros
posed to Miss Sullivan but she relused
on the grounds that she could not
leave Mlssk'cllcr. However-the l’ror
fesscr was equal to the occasion and
replied it need make no dirl'erence to
Miss Kcller as she could always havc
a home with them and that Miss Sul-
livan could still be her teacher. Fur.
thermore, he requested that he be per-
mltted to ask Helen’s consent In the
matter. Miss Sullivan consented and
consequently the Prclcssor belook
llimselfto Miss Keller. He explained
the matter to her and much Lo the
surprise of all, Miss Keller was simply
overioycd. It is said that she showed

the wedding Miss Keller was the maid
of honor and was the happiest girl

lark"7A Pleasing pmduerlon.

T h e cantata by Gorinngiomas,
"The Swan and the Skylark,” to be
given by the Oratorio society on the
evening of Monday, June 12, is a work
which is a unit in itselr»not a series
The
chorus and solo parts are sometimes

of detached arias and choruses.

heard separately, sometimes inter—
woven in passages of wonderful melod-

ic beauty, The text represents a

Grecian poet telling tlle story of the
Swan who looked upon Summer only
to hid it farewell and die, and of the
Skylark who greets the Summer in 3
song of exquisite joy and gladness.
One cannot. fail to realize the wow
derful possibilities of such It theme,
and it is enough to say that Goring-
Tllomns caught the inspiration thor-
oughly. Tile melody of the Swan’s
farewell is exquisite in its pathetic
beauty. The chorus accompanies it
in subdued tones, like the eifect of a
full string orchestra. The song of the
Skylark is just as beautiful in its ex-
uberance and joyfulness. and in it the
chorus plays a markedly dilievent role
than in the Song of the Swan, assert-
ing itself at the climactic points with
great pop-er and dramatic effect. The
Cantata taken all in all is one of the
most melodious, musical and appeal-

ing of modern choral Works

The greatest orator in America will
be here Monday night. Those who
put on hearing Bryan this time will
probably not have the opportunity for
two or three years for this is his last
season on the platiorm. Now is the
time to hear him. The glamour of
his political career has worn or: and
people no longer listen to him for the
mere sake of having seen him. It is
his deep and serious thought and the
magniﬁcanr. expression of the same
which now moi-ks him as our greatest
speaker and which proves beyond
doubt that it is the real character of
the man which counts. Mr. Bryan
has suilered many defeats but under
them all, he smiles and takes up his
next task,ror it is not to advertise
himself that he constantly appears be-
fore the thousands who gather to hear
him, but because he has something
which he truly believes the world
should hear, and because no knows
that it will be far more ctlective given
from his own lips than read from a
printed page.

A combination of thinking and

speaking favors as wonderful as Mr.
Bryan‘s is unusual, but itis all backed
by the stuii that real men are made
of. That is why no one should miss
coming into contact with this man.
It is not the external Mr. Bryan that
he wishes to put beicrc his audiences
but the true man who comes plainly
into view when he talks on such asub-
ject as “The Value of on local.” He
isa powerful man whose energy and
ability are being directed along the
right linesethat of educating his lei-
low men.
After several months of study and
teaching our natural inciinonon is
not to learn anymore than one has to,
but when Mr. Bryon teaches one for-
gets that he i, aialecturc and with»
our knowing it,iabsorbs a multitude of
good things. Things learned in this
way are the things which stick.

Although many seats have been sold.
there are still some good ones to be
had for this lecLure of Mr. Bryan’s.
There is little doubt but that he will
be greeted by a. large audience, and
the good seats will not last forever.
Seats may be reserved at \‘iets '85
