VIOLIN RECITAL.

Mr. Herbert Boiler justiﬁes His High
Repule in a Second Grlnncll Re.
ciialiA Rlcil Program.

)ir. Butler's violin i-coital occurred
Thursday evening. March ninth, in
theCollegeOhapcl. Thnaudicncelvtls
unusually large for in. Illinois play-
ing has been much enjoyed here on
previous occasion. The acconipanie
ments were skillfully performed by
Miss Alice Drake or Chicago. The
program was throughout an excellent
one,

The siuding Suite with its perpetual
iiiotion Prelude, rich Adagio and
brilliant ,lllegl-oniadeadne opening
number. The movement irom the
Tscilhiktlll'sky Concerto was the great»
est number or the program both liiusi-
cally and technically. Mr. Butler
brought outits beautiiul musical ef-
fects in a masterly manner and the
splendid Cadenza was a liiarvel of bold,
clean execution.

Bach was well represented on the
program by the Prelude and Fugue
iroin tiie li r solo Sonata and thc air
for the 5 string, Mr. Butler entered
thoroughly into the spirit of the old
master. The . ‘rwas received with
especial iavor by the audience. The
grand old melody was heard at its
best, The broad sustaining ol' the
bow stroke and the great crescendos
gave tone of wonderful richness.

Thc Ballade by )ioszlrowslri proved
to beone of the Wm'thiest compositions
by that composer, The pure hare
monics and rhythmic variety and
sparkle of the Nacheg Czilrdas and
Sevcik Bohemian Dance made them
very pleasing numbers

Mr. Butler has marvelous technical
ability and added to this the intellect»
ual breadth and emotional sincerity
which mark the true artist.

The recital was altogethera memor-
able one. Mr. Butler will always be
warmly welcomed in Grinnell,

TH E FUREECK RECITALS.

Mrs. Sue Harrington Furheck the
Chicago contralto have two recitals
yesterday ill the college chapel.

Mrs. Furbeck has a magniﬁcient
voice which she handles well. It was
too large for the hall, and at times
Mrs. Forbeolr’s high iortissimos and
especially deep tones gave somewhat
the impression or being iorced. 0n
the other hand many planissimo pass-
ages were exquisitely handled.

nothing repellent in her ideas, but at
times one regretted that they did not
go unite deep enough. The recital or
German songs was eVLi‘emely interest
ing. in the lirst or the Brahms song
M..1"llrlie0k‘s rolec was sullioicntly
Kilitlrlltic, but the climax in tile last
verse, illumm, o liommc‘ bald" im»
press-ed one as broad rather than in-
tense, It requires terrible intensity
or expression, or the elicct oi all that
preceded it is lost. The secorltlisong
was better done. Lack oi sullicient
intensity was also the lanlt oi the
Lied des Ellis-amen, by Spiering, and
whatever the composer's idea in the
second song, the closing line ”Nun
ins-s icli dieli nimmcrmohr” would be
inﬁnitely more ell'ecrive ii sung soltly.
Mr. Spiel-mg displays great talent and
sound musicianship in both composi—

wonderiully beautirul. so that it is
impossible to choose among them and

could be desired.

The evening program was perhaps
more enioycd than that ol the after-
noon, being ior the most part in the
English language. The Lirst number
tailed in its ellectiveness through the
same broadening and lack of intensity

in the climax as noted belore. The
accompaniment was ruined by this ru—
bato interpretation. The second and
third songs were exquisitely done.
The rest of the program was given
a thoroughly satisiying interpretation
especially beautiful being the Elijah
aria with organ accompaniment, the
IIenschel and Hen 'ch songs and the
Massenet.
