HE recelibactlon oi the local Orat-
torical Association in with-
drawingircm the state orgnnr tion
shows the Change of sentiment. which
hasgl'mlually crept into the institu-
tirin concerning oratory. For the last
row years. oratory has been on the
decline and LO the observer its death
was not unexpected. Indeed, the last
sad rites would have been performed
several years ago, had it not been lor
the Herculean efforts of It [CW euthlls»
iosrs who hoped to prolong its exist.
ence and ultimately to restore oratory
to its former position. The rCClint
action of the association only shows
the uselessuess of their elIorts.

It is no secret that oratory does not
interest the average college student
Rt the present time and that debat-
ing and extemporaneous corrtestshayc
largely superseded oratoricnl produc-
tions of the Old type. Whether this
isa. fact to be deplored or not is a
matterorconjecture, but no one can
dispute the wisdom oi the association
in abolishing an institution which no
longer interests the vast majority of
the student body. The old time orar
tory has had irs day and can now be
classiﬁed as ancient history. The
energy iormcrly devoted to that lield
can be directed into the newer chztn»
nels or public speaking. Vole rthue are.
