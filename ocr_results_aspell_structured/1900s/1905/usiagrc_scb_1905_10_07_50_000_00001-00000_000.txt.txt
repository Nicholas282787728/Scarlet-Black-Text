Anyone who has read “The Call of
the Wild”need not be told of Jack
London. That story in itsclr is enough
to place its author‘s name on the roll
of the iamous. He writes and speaks
or what he knows and has seen. His
descriptions are not borrowed ironn
books. He tells his own experience.
When a rnan has seen the world as it
is, and then can make other people
see it through his eyes, he has
achieved great things, but when he
can combine with these a power toget
behind the sari-ace and see the causes
and the meaning or things he be-
comes a genius. Jack London does all
this, He has studied the lite orthe
lower classes rroin Aldslcztlo London
and has witnessed their struggle both
as a man looks on and as oao or them.

Grinucll showed poor form and

by the hardest kind of playing thztt
the touchdowns were made. Davis

well and showed up in good shape.
