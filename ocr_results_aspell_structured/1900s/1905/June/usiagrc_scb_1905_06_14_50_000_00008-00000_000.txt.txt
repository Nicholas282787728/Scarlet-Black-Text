strange depression that creeps over
thespirits of the bravest of men at

marrow, when great events are im-

1n the midst or this depression
which we feel creeping over us even
as we read the account about nineteen
centuries later, the words of the Mas-
ter fall, in the accents of tender Symr

They are great words that fall. “Lore

Poor Phi , he stood at anelevu-
tron or 14,000 feet and was looking
around {or d mountain. He was walli-
ing on the Vell'et plirslr oiGodls prui e
ilowers and asked for a rug. lie was
wondering where he could ﬁnd gold.
while his bonds were bundling diu-
monds.

"Have i been so loirg Lillie with you.
and bust thou not known me, Philip?”
replied Jesus.

Philip is ntypicul oldinal'y Inanilie
replesenls his kind, well nieuuing but
stupid. It wossuid oi Jesus that he
WELs the “Word ml the Word was
witthd, and the Word was Go
“He came nnlo his own, and his own
received lrim now" “He was in the
world, and the world was'lnade by
him, and the world linew him not.‘
And Philip who ought to have
known him, stupidly asks “Show us
the Father."

The gospel accounts reveal to usl
howdillit’ult it was [or Jesus loget
people to recognize Jesus Christ. John
the Baptist, geisu splendid glimpse
of him in his true circrunrer, and ex-
clrrims, “lichold the Lamb oi God,”
and by and by drstrustirrg his vision
sends some men to usk in doubt, “Art
thou he that should come or look we
for another?”

Nicodemus confesses, “We know
then arta teacher come irom Gail,”
aridin the next breath demurs with
the Teucher and suys, “How can a
mun be born again?" The people or
Nazareth exclaim in wonder- “Wllenoe
hethnr man this wisdom and these
mighty li‘ol'ks?” And beiore the
question can be answered they say in
disgust, "Is not this the carpenter’s

son,”alifl are oll‘entled at him. Men

Poor, dull Philipl he did not reulize
that when he walked with Jesus
through the dusty streets healing the
sick. when he cussed along on the

lliillside breaking bread to the 5,000,

when he rowed the boat in the storm
and the Master came and stilleil the
waves, that he was as close to the
Father as liecould be. He never 'new,
dull man that he was, that when he
listened to the sermon on the Mount,
and heard the parable of the Prodigal
Son, he was as near as he erer could
get to hearing the voice or the Father.
