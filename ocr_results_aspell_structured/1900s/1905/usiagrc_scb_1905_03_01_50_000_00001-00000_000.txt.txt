IOWA COLLEGE GIRLS OF THE
PAST.

Sonic ,Ci Our Proml lent Alumnae and
Their Doings

In considering the place and work or
women in Iowa College, our ﬁrst
thought is one or admiration tor the
ruarry talented and noble alumnae who
have held important and otten con-
spicuous positions since their gradua-
tioir. Crrnnell has a body or alumnae
or which any institution might be
proud, Limited to no one lield orac-
Ii 'ty. Iowa College girls have gone

tortlr year utter year to make a place.

and a name for themselves in almost.
eve ' line of work In w ’cll lvomtm
shares

A Grlnl‘lell graduate who htlszlllvﬂys
taken an active interest in the Well’alc
of her Alma Matcr and llnsdone much
for Iowa College sincc she left it is
Mrs. Mary Grinllell Nears, wife or one
or the leading posters of Albany. Iv.
Y. She herself is prominent in mis-
sionztry and philanthropic work and
has written Considerable along these
lines. 55.000 was given {or Meats Cot-
tage by Hon. E. A. Goodnow on condi.
tion that the building hear her name.

Mrs. Mabel thnphere Oonlilin must
be mentioned {ts :1 woman of national
reputation. Journalism has received
much of her attention but she is chief-
lv notable as It lecturer on temperance
and Social purity. She has been a No
tional Organizer for the W. C. T. U.
and Nlttionill Secretary of the White
Cross Society or America.

Mrs. Hannah Noyes Davidson, ’75, :1
brilliant student in her college days,
has made a reputation for herself as a
teacher of politics, economics and his
tory, and as a writer upon these sub-
jects. ller husband, Charles David.
son, is a notable author, critic and
philological student.

The name of Pauline Given Swain]
is essential to n, list of women who
have brought honor to Iowa College.
Newspaper work is her chosen ﬁeld,
but She is much in demand as a speak-
erheiol'e women‘s clubs and redem-
Lions, for she not only writes but de-
livers addresses on sociological and
literary topics.

Among many others. Mrs. J. Irving
Manatt and Mrs. R. M. Haines deserve
special mention, The former, asthe
wife of J. Irving Manott, a prominent
writer, educator and authority on
Greek literature and history, has al-
ways held an enviable position, intel-
lectually and socially. Mrs. Heine:
has been an ideal example of the broad
minded, cultured college womaumliose
inﬂuence in her Own community is in-
estimable.

When we come toertamine the repre
senmtive occupations we ﬁnd Iowa
College women in all of them. Mrs.

 

Bertha. Booth Brewer and Julia Ber-

nard and liertlra liuslr have all done
something worth while in the hold or

who follow other Vocal tolls.

Among the many .sucersslul teachers
whom Grinuell has produced there is
none more prmuincnt than Elimbetll

literature m Redﬁelti College. SOJXLk.
Caroline Sheldon. a member ol the
taculty oi Mills college. Culii., has

Park High School, Chicago. One or
ourrnost prominent altunnae is Miss
Clara Miller-d, ’93, ivlro, atter graduate
work at the University of Chicago,
has had an important position in the
faculty or her Alma Mater.

The woman who has achieved per~
harps the greatest reputation of any
who have left Iowa College halls Was
Miss Hester Hillis, ’65, our ﬁrst foreign
missionarydtnrlsisterof Nowell Dwight
Hillis. She did a wonderful work in
India, spending niteen years in mis-
sionary service in that country and
ﬁnally gave up lret life for it, being
overcome by the heat and excessive
work while makingatourolthejnngle
villages. The Hillis Alcova in the
Library was established in her mem-
ory and is marked by her portrait.
Other unselﬁsh women have followed
her example, among whom may be
mentioned Hannah Taylor Pariah,
'91, a missionary in China, and Mary
E. Brewer, ’85, principal of the Girls’
Boarding school in Sivils, Turkey.
Miss Brewer was in the midst Of the
Armenian massacres and did some
heroic work for her mission people.
Mention must be made, too, of Mrs.
Esther Robbins ‘Vllite, who, Withher
llusbdnd, is located at Marsovhn,
Turkey.

Professional work is represented by
twolrighly successiul physicians. In.
Elizabeth Dunno! Chicago and Mrs.
C, B. Frisbie of Des Moiues. Many
Iowa College women have taken up
the profession or nursing, among whom
Miss Margaret Pepoon and Miss Myrta
Lyman should be named.

The inﬂuence of the Y. W. C A. is
shown by theidrgenumber oralumnae
who have continued their interest in
the association even after their college
days. Mrs. Susan White Childs was
General, Secretary of the Y. W. C. A.
of Indiana {or several years. Mrs.

Grillllcil women have invaded even
the tield or business rind at least two

Moiues, while lidua Sylvester has err-
tire charge or the insurance business
established lly her lather, whose work
she Loni: up all er his death. ‘

With these rew examples which
might be multiplied many times we
have an idea or the sort or women Iowa
College produces and the things they
have been able to accomplish. It
shows, too, that the students ot‘ today
must not lower lire standards set by
the alumnae and that we, like the
girls or yesterday, may have places of
responsibility and honor to occupy.
May we till them as cl'cditdhly as those
who have gone beiore us.

CHAMBER MUSIC RECITAL.

The Second recital of the year by the
string nuartette occur-red Monday
evening, February 27, in the college
chapel. The personnel was as before,
Mis Raw Emil Mr. Smith, violins, Mr.
Milo Smith, viola, (mil Mr. Heighten,
Violoncello. Mr. Smith was also the
pianist ol the evening.

The ﬁrst number was the Beethoven
C minor quartette. » It is one of those
masterpieces of variety and unitysuch
as Beethoven can produce. and it is
one of the greatest of its kind. While
it was not given with the perfect
ﬁnish of it :professional tluartette the
players entered into the spirit or the
compoSItioii. imbued it with warmth
and life and gave it an interpretation
that was highly enjoyable. With the
exception of portions of the ﬁrst lnoVe- ‘
menl. the ensemble was excellent. The
second moremenntne Andante schel‘zor
so, was delightful, It was marked by
a pitlilﬂnt delicacy throughout. The
more sustained melody of the menuet
contrasted well with the sclrerm which
precedes and the lively allcgro which
follows and closes the number. The
qllztrtettedid some oi its best playing
ill the lncnuet and Trio.

The two movements oI the Mendel-
ssohn Sonata contained many ﬁne inel—
odies for the ’cello. There is no more
beautiiui melody instrument than the
’oello in the hands of as skillful a, play-
at as Mr. Heighten:- He draws a rich
and sympathetic tone and his playing
is always thoroughly musical. The
pianist hild a. full share ill the success
of the Sonatlt.

In the last number, the Gade Trio,
the piano has an important part, full
oi line rhythmic and siormlldo eil'ects,
which Mr. Smith brought out admire-
bly. The violin and Violoncello blend-
ed Well with the piano. The sparkling
allegro Vivace and the appealing an»
dantino were given their toll expres-
sion and were the most pleasing of the
foul- movements.

! at was a successful recital, had it. is
hoped the chamber music concerls

will become a permanent leature or
the musical events or each year.
