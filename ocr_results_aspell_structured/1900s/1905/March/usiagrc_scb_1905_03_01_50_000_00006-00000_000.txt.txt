was given a room ill old West College.
This was occupied less than three

and March 24, ISIS, the hall was (lerllr
catedihelng furnished at a cost of
$430. In 1852 IL dispute arose over the
spring election as a result of which 17
inelnbels withdrew from the society.
Two months later the cyclone desl roy-
ctl all the property the society had

been accumulating ior years. During
the fall of 1882 the Cillocagztthizl. met
in the parlors of the Congregational
church. Alumni Hall was built at

- this time and on the third ﬂoor the
Literary societies were to have rooms.
Though now invited lo loin Clli‘estoV

lemalned loyal to Institute and in
January 1533 they occupier] their pres
eut hall,

In dralnatics Caloca has been l'ery
successiul, picsentnig together with
Institute, :in 1892 the Greek play,
“Electra,” Lady of Lyons in 1896, Lady
Bountiful in 1900. and in 1904 The
Little Minister. Injldebale also has
Calocu been interested, holding with
‘Ellis two inter-society debates one in
1896 won by the Ellis and one in 1904
in which Caloca Won.

The later history or Calocagathia is
a record of coilsistcntzivork, good times
and steady progress.

Ellis society is the youngest of the
college literary societies being thirty
years younger than the Oldest, Chresto-
manila On the 29th of April,
1882, eighteen ex»Calocagat.llian girls
met in the southeast room of the old
stone building and organized a new
society taking the name of Miss Mary
Ellis Who aethat time was Lady Princi»
palioi the college. The beginning was
hard as all beginnings] are and to cope
with full-ﬂedged Calocagathia seemed
almost impossible but provideutially
1882 was theﬁyeat of [he Grinnell
cyclone which equalized things ELDC the
tWO Societies started out the next fall
With the some amount of lurnlsliings.
Ellis also metlin the Congicgatlonal
church parlors untilin the spring or
‘84 ChreStDL‘nathia invited them to
occupy with tlleln their new room in
Alumni Hall, their present home.
For many years a systematic four
years‘ course of study was pursued by
Ellis, history being studied in the
fall, literature in the winter and art
in thezspring—out or late this system
has been abandoned allowing greater
freedom and variety In 1896 Ellis won
from Calooa a debate on the question of
Woman’s Suarcgo—and in turn she
lost to Caloca a debateon the question

The social committee is perhaps rlic
oily one which comes within the
notice of the college as a lrllole. Miss
Hunting and her associates are to be
especially commended for their-erect
lent work in this Kllleotion. On June

the campus instead or the usual May
luncheon. The primary nbiecr was
social, 810 only being cleared. In the
lull the usual opening reception ior
young women was held and iollowing
this came the general reception given
jointly with the Y, M. c. A. A very
pleasant and iniormal party was given
October lath in the Women‘s Gymnusr
uin an association members. This
committee also assisted the faculty in
the reception ghen the American
Board. Without doubt the largest
and most successiul undertaking or
the year was the Christmas Bazaar at
which rrlsoo were cleared.

this year is that oi student. leaders,

also increased greatly over that of
former years. Miss Wise’s earnest
work as head at this department is
much appreciated.

Miss Hall has had charge of the
Inter-Collegiate Committee. While
the work or this committee

showing its duties are numerous
and essential. Miss Knowlton has
been chairman of the devotional com»

National Student Secretary, the sun-

to keep the members of the rariorrs
organilarions apart. The social
events or the Christian Association
act as a unifying element bringing to—
gether girlsor all classes and running
Iiicnrlships among those who would
have otherwise scarcely a speaking
acquaintance. The remembrance or
these happy wholesome Irinctioiis is
nothing less than an inspiration to
those who alter-ward work among
peoplewhere there islittlc to stimu—

In like manner the experience gain-

constantly go for licl p and inspiration.
