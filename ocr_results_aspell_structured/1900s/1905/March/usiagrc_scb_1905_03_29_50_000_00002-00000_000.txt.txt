COLLEGE MEN IN comma-r

AS an indication 01' the recognition
today accorded the college men in pole
itics, it is only necessary to point to
the personnel of President Roosevelt‘s
Cabinet. Never in the history 01 the
country have lhere been so many
alummol the higher institutions of
learning in the ollicizll family-oi :I. Chief
The reason Is not hard to
ﬁnd. In the ﬁrst place, the young
man is playing a more important part
in politics than ever before, and the
educated young man, as a general
proposition, is best equipped iorpublie
life. Mr. Roosevelt himself represents
the olhee-holding typo referred to a
few years ago as ”youngsters.”

Or the nine members of the Ramsey
Velt:cabinet lire hold degrees from
Well known higher institutions; two
have had several years in academies:
two are entirely Without college tritiu-
ing, and one of these is Sell-taught,
never having attended any school.
John Hay. secretary of state, is agrari-
uate of Brown University and the law
department of the University of Illi-
nois. Leslie M, Shaw, secretary of the
treasury. took the master's degree
from Cornell college and ﬁnished the
Course in the Iowa School of Law.
\Villiam H. Taft. secretary of War.
graduated from Yale and took the
doctor's degree from the Cincinnati
Law school. \\'llllam l'l. Moody, ate
tDlhey general, is an alumnus from
Mr. Roosevelt’s oml alum mater. l'lar-
vai’d. Victor 1}. Metcalf, secretary
of commerce and lahor. is a Yale man,
and Ethan Allen Hitchcock studied
at the Illllltﬂl'l' school of New
Haven. Gemge B. Corleh-ou took an
academic course at Helnpsleail. L. I.
James Wilson, secl’ctal'yof agriculture,
never went to school. and Paul Moi»
ton. secretary oI the HM). quit school
at Lhe age of fourteen years and enter-
eda railroad olliee.

The president cabinet as the high-
est ndlnlnistlative body ill the Wollrl
is a reﬂection ol'the Spirit of the age,
ll hich recognizes young meniind high-
er education. It brings forcibly to
public ”attention the value of the col-
lege and unil‘el 'ly as an aid to better
equipment for broader and useful life.
