RIDAY night of this week is to
occur the annual state contest

in Oratory at which Grinnell’s repre-
sentative. Mr. William Cochran will
be present to compete ior Iowa Col-
lege. We are told that the railroads
will grant a rate of one and one third
rare for all who attend this meeting.
At present every appearance is that
few beside the three authorized dele-
irorn this institution will attend the
contest and it is almost certain that.
the delegation rr-nm here will be small
out oi all pr-opoi-i ion to the worthiness
oi the cause. Students who have
friends in college at Mount'Vcrnon
would do well to makerhe contest the

Dcoasion OI at neighborly visib.

NE week irorn today the regular
readers or SCARLET AND Btacrr
will be treated to a special edition,
and we funcy that all who may be as
fortunate as to secure ,a copy of tirat
numocr will have occasion to take no
small amount or satisiactiou in it.
Let it be known also that this special
edition will be unique among special
editions since the work rlpon it [rain
the iirstllne to the last will be done
by the ladies oi Iowa College: or more
properly speaking hy acorurnittee to
represent them,

Considering the small dimensions or
the regular paper this special issue
will be trrrly pretentious, it being the
plan to incite rt double the site or the
sheet which appears today. Order-s
will belaten by any member or the
regular stall tor copies at the price or
ten cents each, Orders should be
placed edi'l‘so that the proper nour-
berof extras may be gotten oirt. The
paper will or cruise he delivered as
usual to the regular suhsor-ibcrs.
