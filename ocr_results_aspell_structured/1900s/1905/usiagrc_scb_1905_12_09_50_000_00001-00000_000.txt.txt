INSTITUTE WINS DEBATE,

The chrcstomathian Representatives Fail
to Secure the D:cision in the First
Forensic Contest oirhe Year.

Last evening at the College Chapel
occurred the iirst inter-society debate
of the year, The ljileslion was one of
the burning issues of the day, but the
attendance at the contest was disap-
pointingly small. Both societies were
well represented and at no time did
they mil to root iortlreir respective
champions. Tire debate wasciose irom
start to ﬁnish and interest ran high
at all times. It was one oi the best
contested debates ever iield between
the two societies.

Tire question: Resolved, that when-
ever the InLeI'StiLtE Comillel‘ce Com-
mission slrail iindarailway ratejun-
reasonable or unjustly discriminating,
,i't should have the power to prescribe
a just, reasonable and equitable rate.
Tire prescribed rate shall besubstitut-
ed by the carrier at once, and shall
remain in eiiect until and uniessre-
versed by the Federal Courts, Con-
stitutionality waived.

The aiiirmative was upheld by the
Cliiestomachians, represented by W.
H. McClenon, H. II. Wheaton and W.
W. Tuttle. The Institute supported
the negative and was represented by
Jr A. Knowlton, A. 0. McGill and 0.
wt Boardman. Proiessor Charles
Noble acted as chairman of the even-
ing.

It was a; ' by the clock when the
chairman introduced the ﬁrst speaker
at the evening, iiir. Tuttie oi the
Chrostomathian society. Aitera short
introduction he plunged immediately
into a discussion oi the question
and cited several cases or
rank discriminations. His speech
lacked connection and as an introduc»

tion wasnotsuiiciently prepared. The
speaker attempted to be dramatic in
his delivery and at times his eiiorts
bordered on the humorous.

Mr. R nowlton opened the debate lor
tlre negative and whilehe made nclear
statement oi the question yet his de-
livery was somewhat halting. How»
ever he recovered in his rebuttal and
closed the debate with a masteriul
reiutation or 'his opponent's argu-
lnelits.

Mr. )lcClenon continued the debate
ior thealiirmative and made a strong

upper . He was handicapped by a
poor voice but this deiect was largely
overcome by the clear, logical argu.
merit wiiioh he gave. He set iorth
the advantages oi the Commission
and his arguments were the strongest
given by the anirmative.

The second speech or the negative
was by Mr. Boardman who discussed
in detail the long and short haul.
Tire speaker’s delivery was good and
his speaclr was eiiectii-e throughout.

is given primarily ior the best deliv-
ery. It. is therefore. acontest in the
presentation of oratoricnl selections.
Consequently one may use a declarat-
tion. or an original speech. But the
main emphasis is on delivery. As to
what constitutes a good delivery it is
diiiicultto state. Here we are wont
to call that delivery good which oiiect-
uaily carries irorn the speaker to the
listener the content oi the speech.

N0 method oi judging is prescribed.
Still that method which analyzes
speaking into its various elements
aliiring a certaiir per-cent to each
element is discouraged; while that
method, if it can be called a method,
oijudging by voting the impression
which each speaker makes is encour-
aged. 1t is, thereiorc, recommended
that the judges listen to these speech-
es rcce' ing the impressions which
the variousspoakers irrc able to make,
as onelistens to speeches elsewhere,
And tiioughaspeaking contest issome-
what or an artiiical occasion, yet the
manner oispcaking ought not to be

Tire judges will, without consulta-
tion, read the speakers iirst, second,
