We say, if we Could only ﬁnd the
truth about religion, or society, or the
destiny of men and how they ought
to behave one to another. But he has
revealed it all. We deplore war, and
build more battle ships, and then, cry
out in our inconsistency, "Let us have
peace," and we wonder if some revela-
tion will not Come to us and Show us
how nations may have amlty and con-
cord—when we need not revellltiouv
but eyes open and ears open to see
Him, and to hear Him who has made
all the revelation needtd, who has
laid down the golden rule ior nations
and individuals which Wlll meet every
difﬁculty of tarilI, or railroad rebate,
or reciprocity, or the common use of
the world’s highways.

Men by this time ought to know
better than poor Philip did, and We
ought no longer to re eat his foolsh
remark which woullde our Lordibut
we do. “Show us the Father, and it
sufhcleth us," We say. We say it in
our religion—we are foreverdiscussing
who Christwas and is. We read the
story of his life and death, we note
that though cruciﬁed he became more
and more of a power in humanity.
We observe that the league of p y
which he formed is gradually spread-
ing over the whole earth. We note
tliatiiuinnn history is Signiﬁcant only
as in some Wily he enters into itithab
nations grow and thrive only as they
catch the inspiration of his life: that
turn where we may his personality

Tl s liiing for God, and groping un-
availingly after Him is supposed to
characterize the College man. It has
sometimes been said that the college
necessarily produces an atmosphere
of doubt; now, that college men and
women do_ become unlicted with a
species of Intellectual and spiritual
bewilderment is often the Case. But
the natural atmosphere oi the College
is faith, not doubt. Bewildel‘lllent in
the spiritual realm may come to the
young man and young woman telnpor»
arily, as he acquires a liew vocabulary.
and comes to look more Critically and
exactiligly into those religions truths
hellas been taught to believe But.
when he acquires llis tools for tllil’lk-
illg and discrimination illen his (‘01
lege work ought to lead him into a
larger and saner faith. And as he
goes irom Step to Siel) in his Study he
will ﬁnd himself, if he is not a dull
man like Philip Coming daily Healer

College doubt is a colleEe (ilsehse
not ancrrnal condition of the lutellum
rual lifc. Tile nlun of reul intelleca
loul vision will ulso have spiritual
vision and he who has vision will
see us he reads literlltul'e and studies
the natural acienceu and lets ll‘smiuﬂ
grapple with the problems or philos-
ophy that God is not far away but
very near. He will discover that
this is not it world out of which God
has moved, it he ever did live here
#hut that it is the very place of his
permanent residence. It the dull
man who will task with Pllilip“Sllow
as the Father“ when every course
and group in colleze is instinct with
the lite of God, when laboratory and
microscope and telescope reveal his
power and wisdom; when history and
philosophy are unintelligible lliem-
glyphics without him.

and insuue asylums are full of pen-

hope. Coming from Iowa Clly to
Grinnell one evening this spring, I
saw an illustration of Milan mean:

Flung down upon the dump—of
thu track-was an engine, the cab
was in the mod, the battered pilot
was ranching out hopelessly toward
the lost truck, the great single eye
that had secrcliud the track for miles
was closed, the Wheels were still, the
whistle was mute, the bell was lost,
and the great giant machine which
had hauled the Rocky Mountain Lim-
ired with its sulundid coaches so often
—-with its great experience and its
great power, lay there helpless, Wilb‘
but hope, to be carried bodily to the
scrap heap. The engine was inaus-
urcd not by its experience but its
hope.

The quality of value in your youth-
ful, competent, trained lives is yuut
hope. But that hope does not rest
upon anything less than the love and
power of God in Jesus Christ In

of tuna and wnmen who have wrought

ness us well as their nwn spirits, by
liislove and power In your gait,

struggles of good men and women
who lived thuir lives through faith
in the Son of God.

The very preservation of the stocli
out or which you coma is due to the
fact that your ancestors tried faith»

Jesus Christ, Then, the very oppor-

been furnished by men and women of

It is a good world after all, a
