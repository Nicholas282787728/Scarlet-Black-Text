F there is a student in school

who fails to attend the Car
nell game Sattlldny he is not
showing the right lrind ol loyalty
to Iowa College. Cornell is com-
ing with a strongteanl,determined
to win and the team has agood
record, having dcfcutedAnlcs and
Drake, both of whom won from
Grinnell, But Grinncll has shown
wonderful improvement the
last two weeks. The team is do
ing the best work in its power and
every student must go to the game
Saturday and help ﬁghtthe battle.
And loyalty to college and team
is not shown by empty theories
but by details. Prove your sup-
port to the team by being present
at the game and by coming out to
the mass meeting Friday alter-
noon. Prove your support of the
management by keeping off the
gridiron everywhere and by not
standing on the west sidelines
where you obstruct the view of
spectators in the grandstand.
Prove your loyalty to the highest
traditions of Grinnell by treating
the visitors with all the courtesy
in your power. Give the Cornell
team a cheer as they come upon
the ﬁeld and show them before
and atter the game that Grinncll
is a good place for football games.
And always do the loudest yelling
when the ball is in G ri n n e l ['5
territory

in

HE football team, while at
Indianola was treated in
every way as well as was possible,
and the men and school appreci-
ate this. Too olten there is the
lack of the true sportsman's spirit
in intercollegiate relations, but at
Simpson, Grinnell's representa-
tives were received and treated in
the most courteous manner. This
is the best possible evidence of
the existence, of the true spirit of
intercollegiate athletics.

THE SECOND TEAM WINS
SECOND GAME.

Saturday the Iowa College sec-
ond team played their second
game, on the home grounds. In
spite of some very erratic playing.
especially in ’the ﬁrst half, the
scrubs won from the Brooklyn
high school team, the score being
28-5. The ﬁrst half showed some
especially poor playing on the
part or the scrubs, this halt end-
ing 54), favor of Brooklyn.

In the second half the team
managed to have a little more life
put into it by the addition of
some new men, and played more
consistent football. The latter
part of the game they had little
trouble in making their downs
and the fumbling was not as fre-
quent as before, Lewis and Mullan
gaining almost every time they
were called upon to carry the
ball.

The Brooklyn high school men
were somewhat lighter, but were
not in as good condition as the
second team They had some
good men back of the line who
carried the ball in a creditable
mariner.
