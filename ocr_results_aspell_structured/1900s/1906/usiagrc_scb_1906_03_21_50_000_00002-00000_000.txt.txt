should be a source of inspiration
to every college rnan and woman. It is
to be regretted that more or us should
not have had the privilege oi his ne-
quaintance and yet Proiessor Etson's
work was done. To rnnny oi us he
was only the lrind,nleasant gentleman
whom we were accustomed to see on
the campus or in the library. We
little realized or knew until alter his
death, he great work which he has
done and the immeasurable iniluence
that he has had upon so inany lives.
It is to be regretted, we repeat, that
more or us could not have lrnorvn him
personally and yet the inilueuce or
such a liie does not end with death.
His hie and his works will not be soon
rorgotten but will continue to he an
example ior every thoughtiul student
to emulate. Professor Parker strikes
the keynote when he says that Pm~
ressor Edson never believed in “know
ledge for the sake or knowledge." but
in knowledge that would be or use to
his iellowrnen. That is a point which
many or us are apt to orerlooir in our
scranible ior learning and lor success.
Thelife oiProiessor Edsori was that
or a Christian gentleman aurl scholar.
His lire gll‘es us hope tor the inture
and the world is a beuer place to live
in ior having had such a neon. Henry
Kingman Edson is dead but genera
tions yet to come will rise up and call
him blessed.

TRIBUTES TO PROFESSOR EDSON

Turner that he should he the third
Principal of Iowa‘s pioneer Academy
at Denmark and be welcomed to his
work by eighteen pupils only one or
whom came trorn beyond the boundar-
ies of the hamlet. It was instrnsnat-
ui-al that his ﬁrst year there should
end with one hundred and ﬁve pupils
in his‘care, forty (ourof whom were
from abroad, and that, in 1866, lie on.
rolled two hundred and seventy, and
that two hundred or them came :roin
beyond the limits or Denmark.

We must iorget that he was not
al‘onein'that ﬁeld. Mrs. Edson was
an accomplished teacher whose mis-
sionary spirit had been her inspiration
across the sea and had lost nothing in
crossing the Mississippi, Together
they aimed at the highest and best.
and attracted such youth as darcloped

He never sought place or power,
eulogy or distinction. It was his
highest. ambition to conduct his pupils
along the highesri summits of human
service. He never surrendered him-
selr to the superheiai and seliish inur-
im. "Knowledge for the Sake of know
ledge.” but this was his motto
rather: ”Knowledge, all things, ror
the highest useiulness.”

It isagreat less when such a hu-
man influence drops out of college life.
No ultimate aim there should ever
iall below the stars. '

The present lirs. Edson will always
retain an honored place in all college
circles. lier personal helpiulness to
the college has earned it. While both
