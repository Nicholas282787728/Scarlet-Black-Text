CUE COLLEGE WINS. _ l

The game here lust Saturday p m l
with the Coecollege resulted in dis
appomtment for Iowa College in
general llowerer, it is not the purposc
of the Student body at this point
to criticise any players or any features
of the play in Saturday’s game, We
feel that this duty belongs to the
coach and not to the student body or
ally of its departments and that more
good can be accomplished with this in
view, It is a very easy matter to
stand on the side-lines and pick llaws,
butto get in the game and execute
things precisely tis you think they
ought to be done isa rery dilIereut
matter. We would all like to have
seen Griunell win, but since she lost
let ustztke the deieat graceiullv.

Coe won the game fairly and square-
ly. She made all of her points by
kicks from the ﬁeld yet this is not her
only commendable feature. er’s
men were light but played inst deter»
mined iootball, Her interference
worked together and was ditiicult to
break up. Coe starred on end runs,
Aston and Myers circling the ends for
long gains Townsend at right hall
and Thomas at quarterback also did
excellent nork.

A lack oi determination on the part
or Grinnell perhaps was what lost hei
the game. Her men oittn failed to
get in the game and her attacks seem»
ed inetl‘ec He against Coe’s inter-rer-
ence. 'ine tackling was not sure and
the moi; were slow about getting
down on pants, But, when Glinnell
did brace up she tore Liiiu Coe’s line
{or good gain and doubtless would
hare scored a touchdown if a littlel
more time had remained but time
was cdlzed with the ball within ﬁhnllt
twelrc )ards or the pool line. It is
creditable to beliere that the store as

The new courts which had been un-

Tournament SittLll' were declared
too soit at the last moment, and the
old courts had to be used.

The singles were fast and interest-
ing, even raster than the score shows.

appears to have won his match easily,

it was exactly the opposite.

the second set after the score stood i 3
in his favor. The last set was hard
fought, there being live deuce games
out oi seven played. The closeness ol
the match is shown in the loot that
Culbertson had only a majolity of live
points for the three games.

Harris succeeded in turning the to-
bles and won a closely contested match
from Gregg of Coe. The score was 1-6,
at and 6-3, Harris winning the last
two sets.

Grinnell showed up line in the dou-
bles and won from (Joe easily in two
sets, 6-3, and (5.4. There was only two
deuce games to both sets.

0n the whole the tennis was fast and
interesting and it is hoped that Grin-
