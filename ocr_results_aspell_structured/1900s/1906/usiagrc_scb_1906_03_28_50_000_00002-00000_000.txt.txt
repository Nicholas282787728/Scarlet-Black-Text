RIFLES. Too many or us are
prone to underestimate the im-
portance of Lriiles, Things whichat
ﬁrst seem important, later appear to
he very momentous, with far reaching
inﬂuences and eLrects. One lesson
neglected may mean a hunk or at best,
at leaet double time spent in mairing
up what was lost.

But the thing we should be most
eareiuloi, and as students are most
apt to neglect, is our spare time,
Economiereseaich shows us hilatinr
activity produces incompeteucy. Not
only that, hutit lowers the standard
which has previously been attained.
Acollege professor resently rererred
to “spare time" as the most vulner-
able spot in a student’s lire. Though
this is apt to be the case, there is no
reason why it should remain in that
condition. '

In Iowa College this seeming trilie
is especially easy to eliminate. A lit-
tle thoughtfulness on your part will
accomplish wonders.

Improve your spare time by return-
ing your calls. by posting iourseli on
current events, or by taking alittle
m‘ore exercise. A chain can be no
stronger than its weakest link, so let
us try and strengthen this link by
t} g our spare moments into op

on entire life. F

I do not believe that any person,
who was present at the two meetings
of last Sunday, would not say that the
morning service on account of its sim-
plicity, its beauty, its quietness, was
the more inspiring of the two.

I do not wrsh to criticize in an no
trientlly manner, nor to arouse undue
reeling against the Vesper service but

Mr. Grimth will he remembered by
many of our students as havingplztyed
Macbeth here last year and also lec-
turing at the College Chapel in the
arternoon on Shakespeare and his
plays. .

From the many favorable reports
from other cities where this company
has played. a performance of the very

cludes many actors of note and a hill

carried for lie proper presentation or
this immortal play.

 

 

 

A COMMUNICATION.

EDITOR SCAItLI. I _ D BLAL. .

Feeling that the columns of "mi
paper arealivaysopeiito opinions from
the student body. I am addressing you
accordingly.

Last Sunday we had two religious
services under the auspices of the col-
lege proper. one a quiet hour in the
morning and one a quiet hour in the
evening, 01' Vespers. Themarked (“IA
foreuce in the two meetings has raised
aquestion in my mind, one whom
84150 believe has been in the minds of
many other students, and that is, “Is
Vespers serving the purpose (or which
it was intended?"

One week ago at the close or the
same service, after having listened to
a. talk which was nut quite up to the
usual polished order but one which I
believe was enicyed by many, someone
commented on the service t h ll
“\Vliht 2i pity [0 have our beautiful
