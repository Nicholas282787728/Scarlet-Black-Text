MRS. MAUD EALLINGTON BOOTH

A Few Facts About HThe Little Mnrher"
Whn Comes To Speak to Us
Tonight.

A little over ten years alto there was
organized in connection with the
Volunteers of America. the Prisoners
League. to which Maud Ballington
Booth has devoted most of her atten-
tion since its founding. There are
leagues in most of the large prisons of
America, among them Sing Sing and
Auburn, N. Y., Trenton. N. I, Joliet
111., Columbus, 0., Baltlmore, lid,
and San Quentin, Cal. In this league
tllere is a. constant enrollment of over
8000 new ones coming and going all
the time. The members of the league
take pledges to try and live an up-
right life both in prison and after re-
lease, and experience has shown that
this pledge has not been taken in
vain. In connection with the League
“Hope Halls" have been founded
where the criminal is kept immed-
lately after release until employment
is found for him and he is again start-
ed in liie..ireslr aniline. Many hun—
dreds have received the beneﬁts at
this home and its inﬂuence is widely
ielt throughout the country. It has
proven that only a little common
sense and sympathy are needed to
change areleased convict irom another
plungeimo the paths of wickedness
to the load of honest life. Why has
so much pains been taken and so
much time and oﬁort been spent upon
these people whom the world regards
as outcasts? Because Mrs. Booth
ﬁrmly believes and has conclusively
proveutlrrtt 2.3 per cent or the cone
vlCtS are not lost merely because
prison rralls have surrounded them in
the post and that they are easily
started ripon the right path. Her
books ”Alter Prisou.7\VhaL” is her
afglunent for the criminal and We
cannot but accept her statements.

Her work during the last ten years
has put her in a position to know more
about prison conditions throughout
the counll - as a whole than any other
person. Mrs. Iiootlr is itllvays an op.

THE CHAPEL SERVICE.

Proicssor Noble Speaks or ihe Reason-
ableness of Christian Service a: Friday
Morning Exercises. .

The Chapel service was conducted
by Proiessor Noble on Friday morn-
ing and the theme oi his address was
thagr-easonableness oi Christian liie
and service. His talk was especially
along thcline of the recent revivals
in Gl’innell and was directed to those
who had ior the ﬁrst time publicly
confessed their beilei in Christ. The
address wasinspiring and theaincerity
oi the speaker inspired every student.
“The Grinnoll spi r, means service;
the readiness to immerge hisspirit in
to the spirit at the crowd and the
readiness to‘yield to service.‘ The G rin-
nell spirit leads to and inﬂuences the
service or olle’s his to Christ. Christa;
lire idealizes and realizes this ilieiil.
Christ called his disciples for service,
trained and sent them with the same
end in view. Essence oi the teachings
oiJesus is service. He who loses his
life is the one who wins life. Many
have the idea that the Christian ideal
is a beautllul dream but it‘is not.
Christs’ ideal is the most praoti .rl and
reasonable that has ever been intro-

duced to the world.

The Christian service faces the fact
of sin and acknowledges the need oi
the world. Many have only a vague
indeﬁnitenotionoidoingrlglrt. again.
It is reasonable because it lztys hold or
the supreme, moral (arcs of the uni.
verse. Cllrlsri is the one iricirlrec irorri
the evil-oitile world. Bring your Ille
into contact with that power. It is
not nearly an ideal but it has been
produced hr men and women like you
and me. Greatest men In history have
been in touch with Jesus. The Christ-
men are those who have made a little
light around them. Entirely reason»
able that we should {allow Christ. not

present time are men oi God l‘l‘esent

From the “Fortune Teller” down to
the ”rediemonagp” stand it was an
imitation of the real article. The
side shows, the brass band, and the
various other attractions that make
brilliant the midway were there in full
numbers, and further impressed one
with tile fact that the fair grounds
had moved from the South end of the
city to the campus.‘ As is usual in the
throngs that attend such fairs. one
saw the “seedy farmer,” “the would-
be sport,)) “the sedate old maid," and
"the cirry chap.”

The Gymnasium was appropriately
decorated for the occasion in booths
and bunting. After the guests had
assembled, the program oi thecvening
opened with a selection by the Skud»
unkrille Brass Band, led by lkey
Westlakc. The band hitd been hired
especially for the occasion. Prof. Jay
H De Valleutine. the Original side
show lurker then announced to the
audlellce that he would pull off his big
show. On [lie ouisuie he introduced
to the audience his marvelous [ace
