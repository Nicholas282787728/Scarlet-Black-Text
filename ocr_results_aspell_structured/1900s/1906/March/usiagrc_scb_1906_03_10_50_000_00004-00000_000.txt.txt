The chapel service yesterday mom-
inl: was in charge of Professor Smiley
who spoke on some at the Chieftain;
titres oi the Nashville Convention.
He reviewed the proceedings of the
convention and spoke of the men and
leaders who were present. “The con-
vention represented the high intelli-
game and true culture oi the nation.
Our civilization in ti mercantile way
has not been blessing: and we owe
something to these people, if we are
to do the mix thing.” The talk was
much appreciated and enjoyed by all.
I’roIessor Smiley has endeared himself
to Griunell students and his genuine-
ness and pleasing personality has won
for him the admiration and respect of

the whole student body.
