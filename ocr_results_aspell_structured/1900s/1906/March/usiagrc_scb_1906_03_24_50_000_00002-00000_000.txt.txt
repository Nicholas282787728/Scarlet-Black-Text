A COMMUNICATION

Epmons Scrum“ AND BLAL‘ .

This seems to me to be a ﬁtting
time to express the sentiment which
Ibelieveagreat number of the col-
lege girls feel and which has come to
my notice more strongly than ever
this week. I refer to the coming social
iunction, which occurs next. Friday
evening and which We all look forward
to with pleasure. The View has been
expressed to me that it was not right
that» the men of the school should feel
that. ﬂowers were implied with their
invitations for this occasion. When
we consider that many of our best.
men are supporting themselves in
school. I for one feel that this is an
unnecessary custom. Don’t misun-
derstand ine, Isimply wish to utter
my protest against the too prevalent
idea that it was necessary for that ev-
eiiing’s pleasure that the men go to an
expense which many can not afford.
Can We let such a triﬂe. as a few
newer-s. make or mar an evening?

The wide experience of Director
Innes and his high standing with
musicians of all classes has made it
possible for him to secure the very
best individual players for his band.
The leading coinetist of Innes Band
this season Will be Herman Bellstedt.
who is recognized as one of the few
great Cornet \‘irLuOsi in the world.
Director Innes has also been [014.“er
ate enough to secure the greatest.
musical sensation OI the past season
in \‘aclar Jislrra. who performs the
almost unheard of feat of playing
solos upon the bass Viol. It is said

there is no other musician in the
world now attempting solos upon this

instrument. The list of soloists is
unusually attractive and includes
Virginia Listemann, dramatic
soprano, Frances Boyd. Colorotura
Soprano, Alfred D. Shaw, tenor Her-
man Bellstedt, cometist, J. U. Will-
iams. a famous liarpist brought to
America especially for this tour and
the lamDus Jiskra. At least. four of
of those special ts will be heard dur-
ing the engagement here.

Any one desiring a 1907 Junior An-
nual and who has not ordered one
should do so before April 15E.

SPRING ATHLETICS

The Athletic Management has dc-
cirled Lo try an innovation in the way
of sensou rickets for athletic games to
he held on \Varrl r‘ield this Spring.
Last year till: attendance at. the base
ball games has excceﬂillglysmall de-

_ spite the first that the team played

good bull, and were only defeated once
on the home grounds. This year the
list of home games is better than last
season and the expense to be borne by
the management will he even greater,
but despite this fact the following
oiler Will be made to the students
Which Will put the price of tickets
within the reach Dizlll and should in-
sure a large attendance at all contests
Ii three hundred season tickets can be
sold to students, the price of one d01—
lar and ﬁfty cents will be made for ad~
mission to the six intercollegiate base
hall games and to the Freshman-Soph-
omore and Home Meets. This makes
the average price of the eight events
a little below nineteen cents. a price
which is certainly Within the reach of
all students. This isa lilty per cent
reduction over the price of admission
to the separate erenf held last year
and should be an attractive Dﬁer to all
Students. Papers Will be circulated
during the next few Weeks and it IS L0
be hoped that the required number
may be easily obtained. A season
ticket to the six base ball games alone
will be sold for a 951.25 for the beneﬁt
of track men and Others not interest
ed in the two home track meets. The
Drake Dual Meet and any practice
base ball games which may be soiled-
uled will not be included under the
Oll'er.

Tile following is the list of events to
which the regular season ticket will
