THE OUTLOOK.

Football Mass Meeting held and Prospects
DiscusscdiMany Old FlayersBeclP
No Coach as yet.

A fairly large and enthusiastic mass-
meetlng was held in the lecture room

lin Blair Hall Thursday afternoon ab

which the prospects [or the coining
season‘s work in rootoali were discuss-
ed and the methods and spirit or
Iowa College athletics made plain to
the new men. Trainer Fisher was
chairman or the meeting and outlined
the present condition of aliairs. He
believes that the seeming lack of en-
thusiastn for football this fall is due
to the changed rules and that friends‘
of the game are waitingtosee how
the changes will resulti. There is
plenty ol preliminary work to do and
every one will be given a chance to
prove his worth.

Harold Beyer, 'ElS, gar-e assurance
that although football is certainly
on trialthis year the game has not
been spoiled by the change or rules
but that there really much
interest latent among lovers of the
sportto see how the thing will turn
out, He and Captain Bleauraster,
who spoke nex , irgetlalltneu to get
