a journey from the antipodes," “The
Nashville Convention promises to
bring together the most, remarkable
body or intelligent, consecrated men
and women that this Country has
seen,” “To feel its power, to catch
its Vision, to bend beneath its spirit,
is to enrich liie permanently.”

The news of this convention has
been enthusiastically received by the
members of the Christian Associations
or Iowa College. A deep interest has
been manircsted in the scudyoi mis-
sions, especially by the young women.

FOOTBALL MUST Go.

The Big Nine conference Decrees that
Present Game Musl bc Abolisned Un-
less Radical Reforms are Adopted.

Atameeting held at Chicago last
week, or representatives from the
leading universities oi the Middle
West, commonly known as the Big
Nine. it was uncminously agreed up-
on that football as now played is not, a

suitable college game and that it must}
be radically modiﬁed or completely
abolished {or at. least two years. Tile
action or the conference was most
drastic and was rather unexpected.
Strange to say the men who were the
most radical were the representatives
from Michigan and Wisconsin, insti-
tlltions where football has been the
most. popular and where charges of
corrupcion were most common. Tile
conieronce did not attempt to change
the rules but rather do away with che
evils and co zeiorm the conditions
which accompany and which have
grown om; oi modern football.

Tile conierence in its statement to
the public says, “It is notto our minds,
a question between modifying the
game and leaving it alone. It is a
choice between suspending the game
as an intercollegiate sport or cutting
away its evils. These evils We ﬁnd in
be many, some of them open, some

of them hidden rrom the general
knowledge, and most or them dillicult

to deal with save by radical reforma-
tion The evils [all into two general
classesitllose illhereutin the playing
rules of the game as it stands at pres-
ent, the evils of physical danger and.
brutality, and the moral evils attend-
ant upon the general raising of the
game into atlling or absorbing and
sometimes hysterical public and col-
legizlte interest ...... The fact is that
the game itself must be reformed as a
game and the far more serious de-
generation in athletic standards must
be checked and a healthy condition
restored.”

Some of the evils noted are: the ex~
travagance in the management, the
large sums paid to professional coaches
and trainers and the great expense
connected with the games; the tend-
ency of institutions to exalt the athr
lete above the student, and in con-
nection with this the spirit of unrest
and excitement which thegame causes
during the tall term; the employment
of pruressronal coaches whose sole aim
is to ploduce winning teamsnnd Often
by means- uhicharc contrary lo the
spirit or [he laws; the mounting by
alumni and friends; and lilially the
ion grout publicity given to the con-
tests.

\Vitll these conditions ill mind, the

ibis explcted, will be adopted by all
tlielonding universities and colleges
