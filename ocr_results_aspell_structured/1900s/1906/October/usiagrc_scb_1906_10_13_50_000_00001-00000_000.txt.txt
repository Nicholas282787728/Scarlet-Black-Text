ATHLETIC CARNiVAL.

The athletic management has der
aided to make Saturday, Oct. 20, an
interesting day to all lovers of lithr
leticsi On Llie afternoon of that (lily
Will he held: the {Oat-bill] game with
002 College, a game between the
“scrubs" and some outside team and
the regular [all track meet which this
year will be unusaally interesting be-
cause of the Clasu xelay race; which
will be run. Th 3 will be an unusual
chance for students and towns-
people to see three excellent attracr
Lions in athletics at the moderate
price or liity cents.

chance ro show Loyalty.

Very little mention has been madei
so lav lllls yearol the ﬁnancial support
cl athletics on the part oi the student
body or iowa College. In the large
universities ortlie country, the pro-
coeds irom the iiai-ious games areas
arulelarge enough to cover the en-
tire erponses oi athletics, but in Grin-
nell such acase would be the excep-
tion, Last fall the management
scheduled iour college games (Ames,
doe, Silnpson,’Des Moines) to be play-
ed on Ward Field In these four
games there was a ﬁnancial loss to
the management. The base ball team
is always counted upon tolose money
so that any proceeds which may come
from the state field meet and class
basket ball games are generally more
than used up in trying to balance
the deﬁcit oi the base ball team. Bea
sides this there is a vast sum spent
each year on equipment and supplies,
The base balls for a single seasoncost
over a hundred dollars, the equipment
for the root ball team including balls,
neiv suits, care or the grounds and
other incidental: regularly amounts
to over one hundred dollars. During
the past six months the management
hasspentin the neighborhood cltwo
hundred dolu s on Leilnis courts alone

and

without having :in income liom this
branch or sport or hardly a single dolr
lar. The ideal sistem tor the support
oi athletics would be in hole dn en-
dowment land so that all expenses
could be met without calling upon
the students for lilil A second sys-
tem which would be very satisfactory
would he to have each student pay
something toward the support oi uilr
lotics and athletic teams. liul’oltu

in every program or whatever nae
ture there is one feature which stands
out and remains in memoiy of the
hearers above everything else. It is
that ieature which makes the greatest
impression upon the audience by vir»
tile either of its excellence or its pe—
culiarity. In this week’s program at
the Chrestomathian society, the num-
ber which :produced the greatest lm—
pression was a reading by Clarence E.
Lyon, And the impression it made
was due to its excellence. Mri Lyon
chose a part of Iiougfellow’s Hiawatha
and held the attention oi his audience
to every syllable throughout his entire
delivery.

othernumbers on the program were
extemporaneous speeches by George
Peirce and Wm. Date on the subjects,
respectively, oi The Galveston city

very entertaining piano solo as a next
number and was heartily encoi-ed.
