BOUT once each year it becomes
a necessary to deplore a practice
which seems to result from a. misun-
dersbandlng or the idea. of ”rights and
priveluges." The fact that the oiience
against this ideals an annual onedoes
not imply that it is perpetrated by
new students but a. word of explana-
tion may for their beneﬁt he added to
nwordofreprovallor those who know
better.

We have several people in school
who have some talent at drawing and
lettering and who lend their capabi -
ties to the diu’erent nrgauimions,
Especially the Christian associations,

'in the form of neat and attractive
posters. These posters are distinctly
the property of the organization which
causes them to be made and there is a
deﬁnite idea. in preserving them. It
is hardly necessary to call attention
to the fact that the disappearance or
mutilation of such posbeisi’s a source
01 disappointment and no little incon»
venieuce to those who have them in
charge. Advertising curds for enter-
tainments and games also come under
this head. They are not distributedas
free gifts for anyone Who wants them
but are a purely business proposition.
He who takes one without permission
is interfering with another person’s
business, .

Along the same line comes llie
matter Di books and notebooks which
are left in the halls and cloak rooms.
This may benccreless ivay or tailing
care 0! property but one man's neglect
is no excuse (or another man's crime,

NOW there is no way of getting at
the oﬁeudersin all these cases. One
can only appeal to common honesty
and generosity in the matter and
quietly ask that posters and other
property loin in college buildings be
regarded in the light of the Golden
Rule. if you covet a. person's property
he nervy enough to take it when he is
looking and give him a. chance to pro-
tect his own, His right til it is at
least. equal to yours. It’s simply a.
matter of a. "square deal.”

THE MARRIAGE OF KITTY.

The two scenes or the sparkling
comedy, “The Marriage or Kitty,” to
be produced at the Colonial on Thurs
day Oct 11 by Mr. Jules Murry Oi New
York, are laid in the chambers of a
London barrister and in the Villa of
the heroine on the lake of Geneva,
There is nothing startling in either
the stage setting or in the “atmos-
phere" which surrounds the play. in
the ﬁrst scene the plan is hatched.
and, in the second, carried out to its
delightful conclusion. John Travers,
It solicitor and Gudrfatller t0 Kitty. is
beset by the woes of both his ward and
his friend Sir Reginald Belslz I Kitty
is penniless and has come up to Lon-
don toget married. and 5h Reginald
is sullering from the injustice of his
uncle’s Will, by the terms of which he
must marry More the ﬁrst ufSeptem-
beranu, also, marry someone who is
not “a. Peruvian Widow." His Wise
father knew the only lady he would
marry was :1 Peruvian widow, one
Mde. de Scmidno by name, and knew
also that Sir Reginald would be apt to
follow the conventions of the world
in whichhe moved and not make a.
fuss that would brlng him into dis-
graccl The barrister seeks co do away
with all obstacles to the plans of both
and marries Kitty to the Baronet
“for a. time” in order to comply with
the terms of the will, thinking to unr
do the mischief after it is done by
another subterluge as clever as the
ﬁrstu The conclusion is as delight-

lully humorous as anything seen on
thestage this decade. Miss Florence
Gear so iniuses her own personaliny
into the character or the “wile of
convenience,” vitalizes it with her
own youthful charm, and charges it
with her own radiant beauty that one
realize: how hopeless it is fcl' the lord
to do otherwise than Capitulare abso-
iutely. Prices 25, 50, 75, loo.
