Colfax VS. Third Team. .
Colfax received her ﬁrst tlclcat
otthe season at the hands of Grins
nell's third team last Saturday.
The game was tast irorn start to
ﬁnish. Within four minutes alter
the ﬁrst kickoff Grinncll had her
ﬁrst touchdown, earned by two
long end runs and a few line
smashes.

Colfax seemed to stand in awe
ot the exponents ot higher educa-
tion, and after eight minutes more
ot tast work Grinncil pushed her
full-back over for her second
touchdown. Goal was missed,
making the score it to o.

In the second half Colfax came
to her senses and playcd a hard
desperate game, and, though un-
able to score, had the ball on
Grinnell‘s 5-yard line several
times Glinnell also was unable
to score in the second half.

The Corning Game."

Next Saturday the annual game
between Ames and Grinnell will
be played at Ward Field. The
outcome as usual is in consider
able doubt and can only be a mat
ter of speculation. Neither team
has made a very brilliant record
thus far in the season and stand
about on a par, although the totali-
ty of scorcsrolled up by each team
stands llrlé in favor of Ames.
Ames is reported to be in a 50ml:-
what enfeebled condition just at
present, caused bythe prevalence
ot typhoid tcver among her
students. several iootball plays
ers are reported to be on the hos—
pital list. It is probable, however,
that the team is again organized
and will in no way detract from
her past reputation of putting
torth a llardﬁghting, garncy set
ot football players.

Our light youngsters have gone

 

- nous already, irorn

up against scvcral hard ploposie
which thuy
gained only experience
Whether or not this expelicnce
will enable them to meet then up
poncnts on an equal footing is an
anxious question. In any event
the game will be playcd hard and
a good exhibition at ioothall is

assured.
