The Season’s Work,

The past season, to one on the
outside. must have seemed a sad
and gloomy disappointment to all
followers of Grillnell. The ‘Varr
sity eleven won but hvo games
and scored 26 palms to a total of
195 for opponents. It is not the
purpose of this article to olfer
any excuses for the above show»
ing. The 'Varsity eleven of 1900
waszlcredit to Iowa College in
everything but irs ability to win
games.

playcl's was of gentlerllanly char
acter. When the truth is told it
is well known not so much could
be said of two preceding elevens.
Furthermore it played a heart
breaking schedule and never tor

an instant showed a slump of

Courage.

The second team has been the
most loyal and desperately ag-
gressive aggregation Grinnell has
ever had. It is to be regretted
their schedule was so short. The
“scrubs” deserved more, Some

of these men will surely be seen
on the ’Varsity in 1901.

The organization of a third team
is unique in Iowa football. This
eleven had players that will cer»
tninly make the 'Varsity in two
years, if not soonerl They simply
cannot be kept off. Tlleorelicah
ly it will be seen ri-om lhe append-
ed scores that the third team‘s
record is best of all.
