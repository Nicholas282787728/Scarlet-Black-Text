MINNESOTA'S FOOTBALL TEAM.
“A Team or Stars wno Claim to be
Champions of the West,H

The Minnesota team is one of
the lending teams ofthe West this
year and no one would be gieatly
surprised if they should be the
champions at the end of the sea
son. So far this season their
games have been hardly more
than practice games. Carleton, the
Physicians and Surgeons of Chi-
cago and Nebraska having all
been defeated decisively and
easily without Minnesota's having
her goal-endangered once. The
team or Minnesota University is
composed of veteran players.
most of them on last year's team.
As a team ol individuals, nothing
more could be asked. All the
men are heavy and the icam will
probably average heavter than
any other team in the country.
The line is stronger than last year
if anything. Rogers, the new left
end is a graduate of the Carlisle
Indian School and.is the best
man in his position in the west.
The other men who will most
probably be in the lineup of the
Varsity are: right end, Aune;
right tackle, Waist; right guard,
Mueller, a star player and very
heavy; center, Page; left guard,
Flynn11eft tackle, Fee. another
star; quarterback, Dobie; left half,
Bockman, a sprinter of pro
nounccd ability; right liztlf, La
Fans, considered by sonic the
best halfback in the west; full-
back, Knowlton.

Minnesota’s worst fault this sca-
son has been in lack of team work.

PROFESSOR ows’ RECITAL.

The ﬁrst of a series of recitals
by the Conservatory faculty was
given by Prof. Olds in the chapel
last evening. It was largely at»

very appreciative.

This form at recital is a depare

much more satisfactory. A recit»

standard than a varied program,
and the versatility of an artist al-

two numbers. Prof. Olds' pieces
were well chosen to show his wide
