ORATORICAL CONTEST,

For the past few years interest
in the home oratorical contest has
not been what it should have been
A larger prize was uttered, to come
from the societies, and still there
was not stimulus enough to insure
general participation in an en-
thusiastic home contest. Some
said too much time was given to
athletics. Yet halt the men in
school never make an athletic
team at all, Last year count—
ing all the men in all the athletic
teams would leave sixty per cent
or the men in the college proper
who were not in active athletics.
Another reason alleged forlack of
interest in the home oratorical
contest was the lack of proper
training, the lack or aehair or
oratory for systematic study in
publlc speaking. This year such
a reason is untenable. There is
no reason except simple laelr of
ambition along these lines that
will prevent a successful contest
this year. One thing that has ins
jured the quality of orationsot
late years has been the lack of
thoro preparation. Enough time
was not given to preliminary study
and recasting orations. Students
wrote orations two or three weeks
before the contest instead of put
ting months of time on them.
The contest is held the last week
in December and the time to be~
gin work on orations,
Hard work will do moregood than
anysuperﬁcialtraininganyteacher
or eloeution can give, And when
the composition work is ﬁnished
there is an opportunity for sciens

IOWAiDRAKE GAME.

About 300 supporters of the
“Blue and White" accompanied
Drake's team to Iowa City last
Saturday. The ﬁeld was in cx~
cellentshapc and a much faster
game was anticipated. The prine
ciple feature of the game was the
anioiintottiinetaltcn out by Drake
after almost every down, either to
wrangle over rules or put in a Sub-
stittilc. Their men seellicd to be
in poor rorm tor they were con-
tinually being laid out and six
subs had been put in before the
end of the game.

Although lown's team wotlt was
not ot the host. her mass plays
and interference were good.

Howell. right half for Iowa
and an estrinnell man. played a
good derensive game but was un«
ableto nialte long gains. Stipp
of Des Moines refereed the game.
Final score. Iowa City l2, Drake o.
