N the issue ot December 3rd,
SCARLETAND BLACK will print
an article concerning the basket
hall interests of the college.
Basket ball certainly furnishes a
ﬁne contest from the spectatot's
point otview. and gives plenty of
exercise to the players. Grinnell
has excellentfaeilities EDI‘dCVCiOp'
ing a strong team but has never
yet sent out a team that was
as strong as it might have been
The principal reason ior this weale
mess has been that only a few men
try for the team. It Grinnell is to
send out a basket ball team at all,
it ought to be a good one. Every
iacilitytordeveloping such a team
is offered and if students show
sufﬁcient interest, a very strong
team can be sent out this year.

HE time fortlle annual home
(5 oratorical contest is rapidly
approaching and as yetnotenough
men have signiﬁed their intention
of going into the contest to make
it necessary tohold preliminaries.
For several years there has been
little or no interest shown in this
sortotwork. and the result has
been that. tho Grinnell is a mem-
ber of the Iowa Intercollegiate
Oratorical Association. her reprer
sentatives have not been among
the eight who compete in the state
tontest. This has not been the
fault of those'who have taken part
in the home contests, but the fault
of those who have not. No on:
denies that the ability to express
one's seli in a clear and pleasing
way, is a very desirable accornp
lishment and that even today the
man who has oratorical ability has
something which will always stand
him in good stead, and still there
seems to be no way of arousing
interest in oratorical practise in
Iowa College. In public life the
orator has an immense advantage
over him who has no ability or
training in this line. and in any
profession or business the power
to speak well is apower that never
comes amiss. Every man ought
to have the training that would
enable him to stand before an
audience and make a speech that

was clear and strong. Many men
in business realize this to their
sorrow when it is too late. The
time to make the study and gain
the training is now. when the op
portunities. tlictii-ne. and youthful

enthusiasm are here.

The tollowing concerns a mem
ber of the Iowa Band and is hence
of interest to friends oi Iowa Col-
lege.

"Monday afternoon at three
o‘clock the portraltof Dr, William
Salter. the venerable divine of
Burlington, will be presented to
the state historical department.
