possible to do this within the limits

business or the college that DN‘
that education is something more than
training to see to it that this ttiiion is

much attention to the tlirhcultics ct
this problem and has reached a result
which it believes is both satisfactory
tor present needs, and capable or en-
largemcnt to meet the educational /il:~
mantis ol the l'uture. From what has
been said it will he understood that
loua College does not aim to matte
specialists at those who enter its
courses, because it cherishes the
higher ambition to enlarge their un~
derstanding oi themselves and of the
we ‘d. This it believes is the best
foundation on which to super-impose
technical and protessional training.

There is a spirit which is a result

call it the Grinnell spirit. it would
be tiliiiclllt to analyze it, or to deﬁne
itely mark its bounds. it is some
thing very real tor all that, and con-
tributes mttcli to the higher life at
the college. The basal element in this
spirit is the sense at social unity in

(allied The purpose or
athletics iii a college is not primarily
to win contests. A victory now and
then adds to the cost at lite, but the
ideal or genuine athletics is something
more than victory. Wholesome train-
ing and good discipline which accomr
pany athletics, are more important.
So is the spirit or cooperation and
detetmination which are necessary in
dealing with dilhcult problems. lowa
College has no ambition to be known
as an athletic college, it meters to
be ltnown as a college that puts its
utmost powers into everything it
undertakes to do, it believes in
athletics not as an end, but
as an important element in gen»
eial culture, The sanest judgment in

it is no accident that the Greeks
were both physically and intellectually
supreme. The concrete problems ot
athletics satisly a real need in student,
lile. They give contact with the real
world, cultivate personal initiative
atid help to develop a vigorous inane
hood.

The college believes in growing with
a growing world. Nothing is more
suggestive of the spirit ot the college
titan the way COiEducalian became an
established reality. The men who
tounded the college did not believe in
co-cducation, bitt their slender means
did not permit them to send their
daughters to eastern seniinaries For
this reason they made temporary pro
vision for their daughters in the col»
lege by establishing a ”ladies course."
This course became permanent with-
out spocial action, and linally by a
natural process or development lost
its identity by absorption into the
regular college curriculum. The col-
lege met ili this case the developing
needs ot‘ the age and adjusted itsell
thereto as conditions demanded The
result has been highly sntistactory.
The college, it may he assumed, will
be equally responsive in other mate
tors to any rational demand that may
be made upon it. it is possible that
some greater freedom may be per.
mitted in the choice or subjects rec
quit-ed for admission, particularly in
scientiﬁc lines. This suggestion rests

also that subtects lundamental to

lttture more distinct emphasis than
iii the past. The group system is a
ilexible one, and makes it possible to
accentuate special subjects without
violating in any respect the ideals ot
a sound general education.

The college has always been broad
ly and genuinely religious. it has
tried to emphasize a. gospel or living
which says that true lite and true rec
ligioo are tundamentally one. Air
though it has never cultivated a see
tarian spirit, it has given preliminary
training to many young men prcpan
ing tor the Christian ministry. it
hopes to piepare many more in the
years to come.

J‘lle ideals that got-em the Group
system at lowa College ale: lst. Lib-
eral culture; 2nd. Continuity in at
least two related subiccls; 3d. Adapt-
ability,

Liberal Culture.

The institution applies itselt strict-
ly and exclusively to college worlt, and
hence not only are the entrance re-
quirements tor all groups essentially
alike, but each group, whether it he
classical, scientihc, historical, or what-
ever else in its maior ouality, is dis
tinctly a liberal culture course,sucna
course being considered the best tor
every student to pursue in college, no
matter along what technical protes-
sional line he may wish to specialize
in his giaduate study. it is clear that
the ends or liberal culture demand the
inclusion or certain hasal subjects in
every group; in accordance with the
universal opinion or the best educa-
tional authoi ies, those basal suhtccts
are Mathematics, English Language
and Literature, Foreign Languages
ancient or modern or both). History
or Political Science. Philosophy, and
Laboratory science. All these SuIJ-
iects iii-e thei-ctore incltided in the
scheme tor each group, anti they rep-
resent together a nucleus 01 required
work amounting to mm as to as or
the 120 semester hours in thc tour
YCELI‘S‘ course. The distribution or
time to the dincrent subieets naturally
\‘ai‘les somewhat with the nature or
the group; thus Mathematics and mod-
ml Languages have 2!. l'eizttlvelyitu'ge
place tn the selenium groups. Phil-
oscphy has :i relatively large place
in the historical groups, and so on.
The important point here is that,
no matter what group a sttttleut may
select, he is assured ot the elements
that are generally conceded to be es
scntial to a liberal culture course.

Continuity.

Continuity of slilily in at. least two
sutnccts is secured by the system ol:
ineior suiiiects that givc character to
thc vaiious groups. in connection
with the basal subjects mentioned, the
student must tape a minimum or two
years’ work, five hours i). Weclt', in each
or two allied subjects; these are called
his Majors. Typical combinations or
such majors are two language. or two
laboratory scicnces, or rlistory and
