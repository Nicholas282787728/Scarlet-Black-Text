JACOB Rlls LECTURE.

Large Audience Greets the Famous New
York: rrAn Exceptionally Suong
and Interesting Lecture.

Probably no Grinncll audience
ever awartctl the coming of a pub-
lrc speaker more eagerly and with
greater expectations than did the
one that greeted Jacob Riis Mons
day evening. and surely none ever
went away more pleased with an
entertainment. Mr. Riis disapr
pointed nobody. notwithstanding
the high expectations of allI and
it is safe to say that he left an inle
pression upon each one of his eight
hundred hearers that will last long
atter he himsclt has forgotten the
day he spent here. He was fol
lowed by the undivided attention
ofthe whole audience that bespoke
a deep interest in the subject and
a thorough appreciation of the
speaker; and his earnest manner
told ofa wholersouled devotion to
his worlt that impressed everyone.
Patriotism and sympathy tor sut
fcring humanity pervaded his
cvery sentence. andtire foreign ac~
cent with which he spoke made
his loyalty to the stars and stripes
a matter all the more to be appl‘es
ciated.

As a preface to his lecture. “The
Battle with the Slums." Mr. Riis
directed to the students a icw re-
marks interspersed with bits of
genuine humor and full at sound
common sense. In his whole dlSr
course optimistic. He
pictured the conditions as they are
at their worst. but expressed faith
in better things to come. Vrews
ofthe most wretched tenements.
of the most squalid interiors. and
of human life in the worst of ﬁlth
and rags, iell upon the canvassand
were contrasted with later views
otbright and cheery bloclts that
supplanted them. showing what
has been done in many cases and
what can and will be done in all.

Mr. Riis calls the tenement
house a crime in itself. It stiﬂes
children for want of light and air.
and it rears in crime those who
live to grow up. To build such
houses is murder. and to solve the
tenement house problem is a great
step toward law and order. He
has a solution and is applying it
and with great success. With
