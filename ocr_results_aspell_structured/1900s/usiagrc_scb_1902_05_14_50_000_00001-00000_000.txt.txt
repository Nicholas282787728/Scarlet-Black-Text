STATE HIGH SCHOOL MEE

To he Held Next Friday Morning and
Airernoon at Ward Field.
A Good Meets

Next Friday the state high
school meet will be held tor the
second time under the auspices oi
the Grinnell board oi control and

track management. This meet

means a good deal as an adver-
tisementforlowa College. These
high school students come here
and see the advantages which
Grinnell has to offer and an im-
pression is madeupon them which
may bring them to Grinnell to
college. This impression will be
increased if the students here give
them the right sort of treatment.
And that is what Grinnell will try
to do. We have a school here
that we have just reason to be
proud oi, and we want to show
these visitors what Grinnell is. So
every student oi iowa College
should make an effort to make
the visit oi these young people a
pleasant one.

“/6 should do all in our power
to make the meet successful in
every way. It is a beneﬁt to
Grinnell if we put ourselves into
it in the right way, Every visit-
ing student must be made to feel
that Grinnell has a hearty person-
al welcome for him and this can
only be accomplished through in-
dividual work.

Every one who can should at-
tend the meet, for aside from the
fact that by so doing he will be
showing his loyalty to Grinnell, he
will be well repaid by aday oinnc
sport. Next to the state meet at
Des Moines this is the most inter-
esting track event of the year, and
in some respects the high school
meet is superior to the college
meet. Friday will see some ﬁne
contests, The large number oi
entries in every event insuresa
good contest in each one oi the
ﬁfteen. And most of’the
records made would be point
winners in any college meet in
Iowa. The meet is more than
worth the time spent and the
pricc of admission.

Visitors from high schools all
over the state will be present to
take part or to watch the contests.
Last year there were over ﬁve

iOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL,

hundred high school students
among the spectators and it is ex-
pected that the number this year
will greatly exceed that. So
that the total attendance will be
large and Grinnell people can do
much toward making the day
pleasant ior them. The day oiicrs
splendid opportunities ior doing
good work tor the college and no
one should let them slip by.

The preliminaries in the mar s
ing will be good. They will i -
clude the hurdles, dashes and bl~
cycle races and possibly the
quarter. Prices, 25 cents for pre
liminaries and 50 cents ior after-
noon meet or for both preliml»
naries and finals. The meet will
begin promptly at the time set,
There will be no recitations Fri-
day afternoon.

In the evening a reception will
be given at 8 o’clock in the men's
gymnasium to visiting and town
friends and after that a banquet
has been prepared for the con-
testants at the Rand gym-
nasium.

w
RESULTS on THE MAY
LUNCHEON.

A proﬁt oi about iorty-eight
dollars was realized from the Mzty
Luncheon given Saturday evening
by the Y. w. c. A. girls. The at—
tendance fully realized the ex-
pectations oi the girls and every
thing conspired to make the oc»
casion a pleasant one. The sup-
per of last year was the ﬁrst one
ever given, and on the success at
the one just given depended the
question oi making the custom a
permanent one. Since it seems
to be so generally appreciated by
the college it will no doubt be
continued as an annual feature of
the spring ternL

The proceeds of the fund are to
be used for the establishment ofa
permanent Geneva iund. The
sum of ﬁfty dollars is already
devoted to this purposc, aside
from the money raised Saturday.
The idea is to loan the money
irom year to year to those who
desire to attend the Geneva Con~
ierence, with the understanding
that it is to be repaid within a
stated time after graduation from
college. In this way the iund
will remain permanent.

 

 

ACADEMY DEBATE;

For rhe Second Time the Lewis Literary
Society Will Meet the Society rrorn
Penn College Academy.

The second debate between
Penn College Academy and the
Lewis Literary Society will be held
in the colle ge chapel next
Saturdayevening. Everyeiiortis
being put forward by the team to
bring victory to Grinnell. The
men to whom the Lewis Lits have
entrusted their fortunes on the de-
bating platform has been faith-
iully working for the past ten
months under the supervision oi
Miss Smith and Mr. Crosby.

The work of the debate proper,
the compilation of a brief, the as
signment ofpoints to the members
of the team and the general work
in iormulation oi speeches and re—
buttal, have been carried on under
the ;xperierlced instruction of Mr.
Crosby, while Miss Glenna Smith
has trained the debaters in the
delivery of their speeches.

While not having the direct ad»
vantage ot a coach, which the col»
lege team enjoyed, yet some meth-
odsemployed by Mr.Stipp in prep»
aration of the debate have been
used, the good results of which are
evident in the manner in which
the material is handled and in the
conﬁdencewithwhich each debater
conducts himselfon the ﬂoor.

The Academy has never been
defeated in debate and it remains
in the hands of the men to sustain
this enviable record Saturday
night, butunless the Grinnell spirit
is behind this team, the chances
will be lessened in a large degree,
The question. on the eniorcemcnt
oi the Chinese exclusion laws, up-
held by Tilton, Raley and Mali-
rath, has all the interest character-
istic of a live problem. and those
who hear this debate will not mere-
ly be entertained, but by their at-
tendance show an appreciation oi
the hard work oi the boys, and by
their presence be a source of in-
spiration to them. The Penn
team expects to bring a large num-
ber oi supporters and Penn cn-
thusiasm must be met by a great-
er spirit from Grinnell. The stu-
dentsshould stand bytheAcadcmy
on next Saturday evening and help
add another wreath to the crown
of laurels which graces the debat-
ing record of the Academy.
