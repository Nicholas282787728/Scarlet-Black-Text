MISSOURI ls DEFEATED,

Grinnell Wins a Ragged,Riotou sGamei
Score is-sr

Monday's game at Columbia
was asuccess from the point of
view ofthe score to say the least.
The Missouri team out weighed
us and with such a coach as Mc-
Lean of Michigan, who was so
successful lastyear at Knox, they
should have defeated us.

The game was rough—two Grin-
nell and two Missouri men being
put out for slugging.

No matter where lies the provo»
cation in such acase, the fault is
with both Sides. It is such actions
as these that lead some colleges
to take football from their list of
sports.

Grinnell made her gains almost
anywhere, though the plays which
nettedthe two touchdowns went
around left end. The longer gains
through the Missouri line were
throughthe lettside. The game
was characterized by hard line
bucking, interrupted by trequent
wrangling among the players and
ofﬁcials.

Both teams played poor footr
ball. Our team play ivas loose
and ragged. Robinson had good
interference on a few of his end
runs, but beyond that the forma-
tionS'were weak.

Grinnell lost her two points
which she might have had after
the touchdowns, by Benson
narrowly missing the ﬁrst, and by
Missouri blocking the kick out
after the other touchrdown.

Missouri was unable to score in
the ﬁrst half, during which time
Grinnell got her two touchdowns,
In the secohd half, though the
University men scored their touch-
down and kept Grinnell from an-
other, Doran kicked a goal from

the ﬁeld within the last three
minutes of play.

The Missouri gamegaveVarSity
and scrubs much encouragement
as was shown by an increase in
the number of men at practice
last evening, The loaﬁng and
eventhe quittingtendency seemed
to have ﬂed. With no game this
week, we have two weeks to pre
pare for Iowa. Iowa plays Minne
sola Saturday.

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER IA,

A MATTER OF POLICY.

Let all who have suffered with
late delivery of SCARLET AND
BLACK, look and take encourage-
ment The management has dis-
covered where the blame all lies
and it is not in the United States
Mail. In fact, we believe it is due
in a large measure to a plan where-
of the motive was good but the
result poor. We have hitherto
made it a point to hold the forms
open on Saturdays until most of
the day's athletic contests were
over and the results were in. This
involved a delay which often
made it necessary to hold the
sheet till Monday morning before
the conscientious mailing squad
could ﬁnd time to send out the
edition.

It took the management four
weeks to get this lesson thorough-
ly learned but it knows it by
heart now Hereafter the forms
will be closed at the earliest pos—
sible hour on Wednesdays and
Saturdays and the paper will get
into the mail on the day of publi-
cation. lf anything is lost in not
reporting games on the day of
oecurence, something willalso be
gained in promptness of delivery.
The change is made in the belief
that it will prove to the best in-
tercsts of all concerned.

HIGH SCHOOL vs. KNOXVILLE.

The second football game of
the season to be played on the
home grounds occurred Saturday
afternoon when the High School
defeated the heavy eleven from
Knoxville by the score of I275.

In the early part of the ﬁrst
half the locals were keptbusy tryr
ing to stop the steady line bucks
ofthe visitors, but Grinnell ﬁnally
secured the bail alid twentythi-ee
minutes after the referee's whistle
sounded Captain Seurwas pushed
over forthe single touch down in
this half. Sear kicked an easy
goal.

In the second half Grinnell al-
lowed Knoxville to score by make
ing the serious mistake of not
punting on her twelve yard line.
on their one yard line the High
School put upa fine deienee but
the visitors were not to be denied
and by ﬁerce line smashes soon
pushed the ballover for their sin-
gle touch-down.

A few minutes after the kick-off
Little picked up the ball on a
fumble and ran twenty yards tor
Grinnell's second touch-down,
Sear kicking another easy goal
making the ﬁnal score 12—5. The
game was called soon after this
on account of darkness with ten
minutes more of play.

The low score may be account~
ed for by considerable fumbling
and an attack of overconﬁdcnce.

 

AMES SINGLES, GRINNELL
DOUBLES.

Saturday's Tournament as srsre College
People saw it.
From] SC Student,

In _thc singles. Holbrook had
Belden of Grinnell at his mercy.
Not until the ﬁfth game could the
Grinnell star take one point.
Throughout the three sets Hols
brook played easily but surely,
makingamajority of the games
and at no time being pushed,

The doubles make adifferent
story. Belden and Blatherwick,
the Grinnell players, worked to-
gether admirably, and their sun
perior teamrwork won, Ames
played hard, however, making
the ﬁrst two sets deuce and al-
most every game a deuce game.
Sixteen games for the ﬁrst set
and fourteen for the second set
were required. Rowat and Hol-
brook, the Ames representatives,
each did good individual work
throughout, attimes playing bril-
liantlyr Prof. Meeker refereed
and Tellier of Ames and Wilder
of Grinnell acted as linesmen.
Ames will have another chance
at the Grinnellites next spring
and we are expecting a different
story.

THE CHRESTOMATHIAN DEBAT-

' ING TEAM.

The preliminary debate of the
Chrestomathlan Society was held
last Saturday evening, at which
the team which is to meet the
Grinnell Institute in debate was
chosen. Since the question dis-
cussed was the same as the one
which will be debated by the two
teams later, it was thought best to
have the meeting open to society
members only.

The contesr was entered by six
men who were: Chapin, Heeren.
Paul. Collins. Leyenbei'ger and
Barnard. Each of these men has
been through and helped to win
at least one interrsociety debate
which probably accounts for the
fact that the men were so evenly
matched. The five judges were:
Prin. Tliornbui‘g, Rev. S. R.
Robinson, Mr. McMillan, Miss
Fisher and Mr. Richards of
Knoxville. First place was
given to C. R. Barnard, '04, while
the markings showed W. E. Paul,
'05, and H, W. Leyenberger, ’04,
to be tied ior second place; alterr
nate was givento }. J. Heeren.
"05.

The interrsociety debate will be
held late in the fall and from the
personnel of the two teamsaclose
contest may be expected. At
that time and from the six men
who compete in that debate
will be chosen the intercollegiate
team, which will meet the Cornell
debaters in the spring.

'no PICNIC

Sophomores Make Merry at an lniormal
Field Meet.

Oct. ID, 1903, is a date long to
be remembered by the members
of 1906. The class about sixty
strong left Blair Hall at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning and were con-
veyed to Jones’ grove three and
one-half miles north and west of
town. The journey was'more of
a cross country jogthan amodem
trolley ride which was due to bad
roads and hills. nevertheless it
was enjoyed by all.

At 12:30 lunch was served. The
absence of silverware, colored
waiters, etc., and the presence of
tin cups and paper plates made
thisavery informal part of the
day’s program.

A ﬁeld meet conducted in a
very systematic way formed the
larger portion of the afternoon’s
entertainment,

Various other events were Con-
tested during the afternoon.
Owing to unfavorable conditions
no records were broken.

The program concluded with ,
an Indian pow pow around the
dying ﬂames of a hon ﬁre.

At 5:30 the rigs arrived and a
more jovial crowd was never
hauled home from a picnic ground.
Every one was in good spirits and
'06 seemed more like a class than
ever before.

President Bradley has been
authorized by Colonel Flank O.
Lowden whom we heard in Grin-
nell at last commcncement time,

to erect a flag pole in memory of
his visit here. The staff will soon
be oneof the most conspicuous-
ﬁxtures ct our college campus.
Allwho heztrd Mr. Lowden's ad—
dress last June remember- it as
one of the most impressive ever
given here. It is more than
gratifying to know that he still
holds us in memory.

All men and women of the col-
lege who are interested in the
cause of Oratory are requested to
meet in the chapel this evening at
six forty ﬁve. Professor Ryan
and several others are to speak
brietly.
