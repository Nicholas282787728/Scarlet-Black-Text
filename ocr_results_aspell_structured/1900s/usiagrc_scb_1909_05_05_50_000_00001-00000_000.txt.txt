Yesterday, an ideal baseball day, the
home team Went down in defeat at the
hands of Nebraska. University by a
score or 3-1 in a ten-inning contest.
The diamond was in fine shape and the
play was fast and errorless through-
out.

Nebraska started things in the ﬁrst
inning by sending a man around to
third on a hit and a Wild pitch, but
Smithson pulled himself out with a
Btﬂke out, and a ﬂy to leit ﬁeld. From

Only once did either side have a
good chance to score and that was in

atmosphere better adapted to a foot»

scantily clad athletes to brave the cold.
Naturally with such weather condi
tions the records were. without excep-
tion, slow, olthough some or the races
developed good contests in spitc or the
nniovornblc conditions. The crowd
which braved the stormy weather w s
rewarded at the start by seeing Grin

will welcome the opportunity of hear
ing him in solo work here tor the ﬁrst
tirnc, and especially or hearing him in
the bealltilul and tnnciul “Faust" solo.

The entertainment should commend
itself to' many, both ror its musical at
tractlveness, which is or a more or less
popular nature, at the same time that
it is thoroughly worthy, and for the
fact that the proceeds are to go to so
worthy a cause as the School oi Music.
