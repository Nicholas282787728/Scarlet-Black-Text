“A BATTLE erH THE SLUMS.”

Jncnh Riis Gives Convincing Statements
Concerning his objecrs, Methods and
Results inudience is Large.

In spite of the bad weather con-
ditions on Monday night the Congre-
gatlonal church contained a large and
appreciative audience Which had gath-
ered to hear "the most useful citizen
in America” tell of his life Work and
success. The lecture was illustrated by
lantern slides made froln photographs
taken by Mr. Riis himself, and these
served to heighten the Vivid contrast
between the old conditions and the
new in the slums of New York City.
Every one was glad to hear Mr. Riis,
for although many in the audience
had heard him at least once before
and though much of the material pre-
sented can be found in the books he
has written, his subject is one in
which every one is interested, for it
tells of christian life and effort result-
ing in accomplishments which really
countforsolnething. Dean Main in-
troduced the speaker shortly alter
eight o’clock and no time was lost in
getting at the subject in hand.

Mr. Riis was particulur_.to state
that onlyaportion of the credit for
the work done is due to him. Al~
though he originated and planned the
work but little oi the actual execution
of ithas been done by his hands. He
and his associates have done this work
because they are American citizens
and know that a clean and honest car
tion cannot be built upon it pigrstyme-
cause all men are made in the image
or God.and ho chrlearing man wants
to see that image destroyed, Good
citizens and Christian men and women
must come from good surroundings.
Thousands of girls and buys in New
York were being raised in circum-
stances which bred pestilence and
Crime. To save these has been the
mission of Jacob Itiis and his compan-
Tile reasons ior these corrupt
conditions in lower New York were
two. Tenement houses were built in
the cheapest manner posssbie and
crowded close together by landlords
whose greed for money exceeded their
sense of common honesty and decency.
Then too, it was to the interest or
the Tammany Ring to suppress the
poor of the city in order to keep a
large number of votes under control.
Tile systematic charities organized by
Riis set to Work to accomplish some
permanent relief from these foul
conditions. They managed to get the
attention 01 the board of health at
the time when Roosevelt was a mem-
her, and with their co-operrtiou some
work was done, especially in the way
of cleaning up the municipal lodging
houses. To the President, Riis pays
great respect and honor, and receives
the same in return. Another way of
rescuing the slum children from their
surroundings was by building school

houses in the tenement districts. Play
