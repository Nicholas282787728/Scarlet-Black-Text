is no good in the universe, thcrc is no
achievement in history, there is no great
soul that has ever lived, thcrc is no ideal
oi prophet or dream or poet, that is not
included in our conception oi what God
is. And even aiter we have put into our
thought oi Him all that has been, or is, or
in our imagination can be,7yet are we
inﬁnitely removed irom what He really is.

Surely, it we can onlybegin to reach out
with heart and mind and spirit aitcr this
reality oi HIS being, there is ground
enough ior an humble conﬁdence that the
call oi Jesus to Trust God, is sate.

What persuasion can be uttered, or
what persuasion can there be tliv can ins
duce us to accept this graciousinvitation
which the universe itseli lays at our ieet
to Trust God? what can the most anx-
iously loving God do to induce us to trust
him? We believe God to bc universal
spirit. How can he appear, ior instance,
on this plattcrm and speak words oi
human language bidding its trust Him?
Such a manifestation would make God
less to us than our thought of Him al-
ready is, and so might estrange us from
him rather than attract us to him. stipe
pose Jesus himselt in person could ap.
pear here and looking with his human
eyes into ours,and utter his words again,
“Believe in God, believe also in me."

could never see him.

We may well believe, and it is no
strange faith. that this inﬁnite God has
done all that he can do to reveal hiniselt
to us. He. is not the unbounded love
which we believe him to he, unlosshe has
exhausted all divinc possibilities in mak
ing himseli known to us. It is not the
“Glory oi God to conceal himself," as the
older theologians taught; the glory oi

to think hard at it a moment to realize
that he has done all that is possible to
put heiore us in thc iullest way every

as a ioundation ior Jesus' call to Trust
God.

The preacher in Christ‘s name can only
repeat the gracious words, and beg you
to enter into the largest life that is pos-
sible by trusting God. There is no way
of life like this way. There is no other
ivay or peace that is worthy the name oi
peace but this way. Here lies salvation
irom sin, Here lies help in every hour
of temptation. If our lives can be ab.
sorbcd in the great vision of that which Is
high and true and pure and right; in oth-
er words, if we can be ﬁlled with the
thought oi God, we must trust him and
shall have no time nor strength nor wish
to wander into ways that mean loss and
sin and death. Let us love life and bind
our lives to thc immortal love of God, If
our lives he one with his, consciously so
by our deﬁnite and unclmngcablc choice,
thcn have we chosen the bcttcr part
which can not be taken away from us.
For our lives may be, by trusting God,
consciously one with his life. Then there
is strength and peace.

Christian Association Address.

Those who listened to the ad-
dress before the Christian Assoc-
iation of the college Sunday even-
ing, by the Rev. Mr. Beyers oi
Kcokuk, will agree that the mess-
age presented was one oi wisdom
and helpfulness. Miss Star, the
president of the Y. W. c. A. read
the scripture lesson. After pray—
er by the Rey. Gurshom Hill, the
speaker of the evening was intro-
duced by Mr. McCartney, the
president of the Y. M. C. A. Mr.
Beyers took for his text ”Narrow
is the gate and straight is the way
that leadeth to eternal lite.“

We oiten iorget that all
good things have a price on them,
that in all departments of life dc»
sirablc things cost an effort. But
we may have a great many things
without having the life that Jesus
talked about. Lite may be con-
sidered iroin three points of view,
all oi which are important. ist,
Selfrward. 2nd. Brother-ward.
3rd, God-ward.

Resignation, Miss

 

Lite in its seii—ward aspect
means that we must make of our-
sclves all we can. We must work
out our own salvation, and we
ought to think of salvation as a
process oi becoming. Nothing
less than the best I can become
is worthy oime. I must gather
up the things that come to me
by inhct-itance, and grow stronger
with the passing day. Out ot cn»
vironment we grow tip into the
thing that God would have us he.

Life in its brother-ward as-
pect means service. I desire to
grow larger in order that 1 may
serve. God has intended man to
be a marker. Work is not a Curse
but a blessing. You must help
do something that will make your
brother's life rich; and each must
do in his alloted place the thing
he or she can do best. It is yours
to get your shoulder under the
world's burden; to play the good
Samaraton, \Vllcnever opportunity
offers.

Life in its God-ward aspect
meansindividualcommunion with,
and knowledge of, God. Without
this all clse avails little, Lifc
mcans thatyou shall be all you
can. and be and do all you can in
the vision of God.

Jesus stated a universal fact
when he said that narrow is the
gate that leadcth unto life. It
applies to our practical workrar
day lives. Life must be willing to
walk in ways of drudgery, Life
is often full of hard and unpoetic
things; but by the hardship that
comes in the daily grind will your
soul grow large. Earth's chosen
Items such as Moses, Paul, Luther,
Cromwell and Lincoln have found
the gate narrow and the path
straight. He, who will, may build
his home on easy street but he
will not live there. The word of
the master is true to-day as 31»
ways, and truein every depart-
ment of life.

Class Day.

The class Day exercises oi the
class of ratio, held in the Rand

Gymnasium, Monday morning,
June 11, were certainly worthy of
appreciation shown by the large
audience present. The prize
number was a solo “Thou art gone
iar, tar away" rendered in a very
pleasingmanner by Miss Margaret
M. McCornack, Jesse M. Owen
in the Class Poem very beautifully
voiced the kindly advice of the
dear Alma Mater to her departing
Children; and then turned to hear
and heed the call of the spirit of
the world of men. Miss Ruth
Field, who gave the ”Farewell to
President Gates.” paid a glowing
tribute to his noble Work for Iowa
College; and, in behalf of the class
of 1900, dedicated to the President
at permanent tund of one thousand

dollars or more to be known as
the President Gates. Fund, the
primary object of which is to
further the ideal of social Service
by aiding one or more students to
combine actual social service with
the scientiﬁc study oi existing
social conditions. The ClassSong
written by A. L. Frisbic was then
sung by the members ofthe class.
The mantle oration dclivcred by
Miss Nellie Greene Clarke was
exceptionally good. Thespeaker
outlined the leading tendencies of
our Republican form of govern»
ment, showed how the public
schools and high schools have
developed from them,andthen dc-
scribed our higher institutions of
learning as the training school for
the future statesmen of our coun-
try. In bestowing the mantle up-
on thc Juniors, Miss Clarke very
feelingly said farewell to senior
duties and senior privileges, and
bade the new class 'fall hall!"
“The song of the Vikings" by a
chorus of twelve voices from
among the members of the class
was so enthusiastically received
that they were compelled to give
an encore. The program closed
witha play "The Silent Voice" by
Laurence Alma Tadema. The
story of the play is a pretty tale
of the 16th Century, The Duch-
ess and her maids are sitting in
the Duchess’s room at work near
the close of day. The maidens
talk of love, which the Duchess
encourages by her dreams oi the
noble knights who will one day
come to claim them. The page
announces a messenger, Henry
Osborne, who brings to the Duch-
ess the vision "of home and girl-
hood, father, mothcr, friends; of
ﬁelds and woods and freedom."
An old cffection is awakened in
the heart of the Duchess and they
become quite intimate again.
But then bliss is rudely shattered
by the announcement of the page
that the Duke has called and
Osborne takes his leave as he goes
off to the wars. The Duchess
feigns sickness and with bowed
head listens to the fateful song,
“But iied ere he had taught the
lip to utter what thc dumb heart
sings.“ All the characters acted
their parts well, and the rich stage
settings and costumesadded much
to the beauty of the presentation.
The cast was as follows:
The Duchess ............ Carrie Denise
