ed in ibscn and contemporary

TION FROM H. L, BEVER. ’95.

H, L. Beyer. '98, writes that
he was present at a gathering of
race students in the assembly
room of the Harvard Union. last

the tnotball game between Har-
vard and Pennstllvania. A large
board was set up at one end of
the room with the diagram of the
ﬁeld on it, which indicated the
position or the ball as the game
progressed. In the great joy over
the outcome. there were a few in
the great Harvard familv who also
rejoict'd over Simpson's Waterloo,
and the success which has attends
ed the Grinnell team this year.
