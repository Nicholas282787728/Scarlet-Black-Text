BIBLE STUDY.

The attention of the men or the col»
lege is called to the Bible study we

carried on by the r. M. c. n. in this '

issue of the paper This phase or A -
sociation work has developed rapidly
width: the last. few years. Bible study
has a. cultural and religious value
which gives it a claim irpon the time
of every man interested in the best ior
himself and (or the institution oi
which ire is a member. When the op.
portunity comes your way tomorrow.
don't fall to let these claims assert
themselves.

THIS WEEK’S CHAPEL.

Comment favorable to this week or
chapel service has been very frequent.
Each service has been the occasion oi
the deiinite e. ression ot one or more
ideas that cool rbrrte to the enlarge-
ment or ones appreciation of bite. Al.

or tile attendance has not increased
as much as could be desired. such ser.
vices as those ot the past week will
soon press it home to the absent stu.
dent. that the daily chapel service is
an essential part of every days pro
gram.

READING.

The talk of Professor Weller rela-
-tlve lo the importance and necessity
of realizing the opportunity for more
general reading. is particularly timely.
All of the students have spent enough
or the year getting the mechanical side
at their work adjusted. All should

» have by this time some tair estimation

-oi the relative value oi the ditterent
things of value that may be gained
here. Now is the time to allow the
claim ior this part or college training
to assert i elr With the iacilities at
hand in Grinnell. tew ot the present
.generation of students will have such
an opportunity again. Nothing can
contribute more to your out e ‘riie
than the ability to read intclligently
and \yidch'.

this issue or the paper the opinions

INTERT'IEWER.

“I don't see what we could do with.
out football,” said Captain W. A Zieg-
ler of this year’s ioothaii team. “If
Grinneli wants to keep her position as
a college or the first class among the
other institutions of the state. we will
hdve to play football. I think that it
is the greatest game that I ever played
and I think it would be the craziest
kind of an idea to do away with it.
Football is the biggest kind at an ad.
vertisement that the college can have.
It's a wholesome. stimulating game,
and a college without it would lose an
interesting and valuable feature of
their lite.‘

“We will have ioothall as long as
the people want it and there will be
plenty of players as long as the pub-
lic wants the game." said Professor
Peri-lug this week. “no I think the
people still want the game as much as
they ever did? What does it look like
when we have 900 people zit a footlitill
same here in Grinnell. and a high
school same at that? in the cast it is
common to have from thirty to forty
..orrsand people at the big games.
Football as a sport is all right. The
pcrrnarreut iniurics resulting from it
are. I venture to say. no moi primer.
ous than those from basketball or
truck With some protection tor the
