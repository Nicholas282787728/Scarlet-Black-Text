At the start oi the game Griilnell

Yesterday, in the last intercollegiate
game oi the season the Crinncll live
proved themselves worthy oi the title
or collegiate champions of lowa. For,
in spite of the peculiarity oi the court,
which is especially adapted to Drake's
style of play, the "Champs" decis 'ely
defeated that aggregation yesterday
afternoon.

The game started a triﬂe slowlr.
Camel getting the ﬁrst basket. This
was iollowcd ha- a basket by Vcr
l’loeg and a tree throw by Taylor,
These placed the Drake team for an
instant ahead. The "Champs" then
warmed up, and the score at the end
or the first half was 20-9. it was in
the second halt that the Gi'lnnell toss-
ers Showed their true form. however.
They had the game well in hand, scorr
ing 19 points and allowing Drake only
two baskets.

it can truly be said that Grinnell
bad a team of all stars in the game
yesterday and any one could be picked
as the star. Captain llachchron and
Epperson ossily out-played their ior-
Drake guards bewildered, while zieg-
ler displayed his true caliber, secur-
ing four baskets to his opponent’s
none.

WOMEN SUEERAOISIS
ACTIVE IN COLLEGE

ORG. Z.\’l‘10) MADE SATURDAY;
PURPOSE LARGELY RESEARCH

.\ Branch oi the Great national Wom-
oil‘s lion-maul is inaugurated
in Gl'iilllell.

In the organization of the Woman's
Suffrage League in Grinnell this past
week, we have the ﬁrst tremor oi the
world-wide movement which has, 01
late years. been shaking England to

its foundation, and securing wide-

spread recognition in the States. This
organization has been eiiected with
extreme quiet, and it is for this reason
probably hard to realize the true sig-
nlﬁcance of this expression oi the
opinions oi a consider-able portion of
our Crinneil co-eds.

While there was no daunting of sui-
fragette banners in the air, no street
parades such as we are told usually
accompany the demonstrations at the
fair sex on the trail oi the ballot-box,
it is probable that no event or the
past year will bear greater results,
nor have more lard-caching eiiects
than the establishment oi this Chapter
at "The Women‘s Surfragist League
oi America."

in an interview yesterday the mesh
dent outlined the scope of the work oi
the local chapter. The aim of the on
ganization is rather an educational
and instructive one than combative
and aggressive. The leaders will try
rather to interest others in the move-
ment and its vast consequences, by
insistent and careful work, than to
start an immediate campaign in town
College and Crinnetl, tor the complete
right oi the polls. Such a purpose is
surely a praise-worthy one. and the
large number already grouped about
the standard ioreshadows the com-
plete conquest of at least the feminine
portion of the College society.

in this movement, as in many oth-
ers, Gl'lmlell has taken the lead in
the state, this being the ﬁrst chapter
oi the national organization installed
in any college of the state. The whole
plan is modelled on the pattern of the
1'. W. c- A. with the national heads
quarters in New York, and the moves
mcnt bids fair to equal the latter in
its universal spread.

At the last meeting of the society
the following oificers were chosen.

Laura Johnston, president.

Alice Lemmon, vice president.

Dorothy Peterson. secretary.

This excellent stali oi oﬁlcers has
already started its work along the
lines oi recruiting. and henceiortb
there will be added to the old hum oi
outside activities in Grinnell, the low.
threatening, ever-increasing, under-
tone oi the' lows College Sudrsgotta
movement.
