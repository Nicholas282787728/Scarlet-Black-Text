The Proposed Collin:

During the coining week there will
be presented to the student body,
through their various classes, the op-
Dol'tlillity to approve or disapprove a
plan for the reorganlzatiou oi llie C017
lege Council which, it ﬁnally adopted,
will give that body powers such as
have never previously been ccnrerred
upon a, student organization in Grin-
nell College. In its broader ﬁshect
and in many of its provisions the plan
is an excellent one and well worthy of
adoption, but it has details in it which
We. ous. These are minor points,
perhaps it may be said, and might not
be worthy of attention if the proposed
constitution were intended for a less
powerful body but, matters standing
as they do, it is the duty of eve
student to investigate these points in-
telligently and carefully before giving
his individual sanction to the plan's
adoption,

1. The Council ln drafting the plan
has admitted the deSll'abilll-y of “Ur
has admitted the desii'uhilit} of under-
class representation, but have not seen

ﬁt to include these representatives in
any one of the three committees which
the proposed Cons itution provides in
Section 2 of Article 3 and in \lllirll.
as we understand from the Constitrr
tion, the greater part or the real stir
dent opinion will be created. The
derclassmen seem to have been siren
the semblance of power with very lit-
tle of its reality.

2. The Constitution
provides that it shall go into ellcct as
soon as approved hy the faculty, the
three of {he

present Council and
classes. Historical precedent and com-
mon democracy alike demand that an
instrument or this sort proriding self
government, he only binding on thosc
who care to adopt it, It should either
be adopted by all four rlnsscs, or by n

majority oi the student body, outside
of class lilies.

3. The most Ohio
the lot, in our opinion, is Article 7,
the election or

Senior members. ll nieinhers are to
be chosen at all by the Senior mem-
bel's it would seem that the votes nec
essary to n choice should not be less
than that used in other organizations
which it is desired to keep upon a
high plane. The third section or the
same article is also offensive, in that
it provides that the names proposed
to the class for approval shall he licpt
absolutely s rct until snhmittcd to the
class, thus ci'lectuallr preventing any
discussloil upou tho numcs except such
