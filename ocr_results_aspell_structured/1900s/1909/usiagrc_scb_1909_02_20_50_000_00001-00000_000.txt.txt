S {SON'S PROSPECTS
The Outlook for n “inning Tom“ is
Good—Hull and Slugllt Are Not
Eligibleillair Cilplllill.

Now, since our basketball ﬁve have
closed the most diir'icult part of their
schedule with sllch credit, interest is
beginning to be centered on the spring
track activities, For the past two
years Grinnell teams have returned
from Des Muilles victorious, it rests
with captain hair and his mell wuelh»
er the state cup shall be brought here
tor a third lime, and placed in the
trophy case as a permanent ﬁxture.
There is a good strong ﬁghting chance
tor the Grinnell traclr team and it
every man does all that is in his pow-
er, victory will tall here for the third
successive year. '

The losses have been serious, tor
the men who have completed their
tour years were certain point win-
ners. Huﬂiand Siagbt, whose days
in intercollegiate athletics are over,
are two oi the surest winners, who
have ever represented Grinnell on the
track. Dawson, lilolr and Beers, mem.
bers oi last year's relay teams, are
all out oi school and in addition to
this, is the fact that no material en-
iered with last year‘s class oi caliber
sutiicient to ﬁll their places at the
start. Cross, Boydck, iiason,'laarnes
and Shinstrom are all good men, wro
will, perhaps this year, develop into
point winners, but the burden or the
work next spring will rest upon the
remainder oi lest year's track temd.

A glance over the hold shows that,
‘wilh these losses, Grinneli’s chances
a're not bad. Turner, Flanagan, Ma~
snn, Gill and Barnes will represent
the Scarlet and Black in the dashes.
Knowles, oi Ames, will probably prove
Turner's most serious competition In
the 100 and 220 yard dashes. Iowa is
boasting a couple of last sprinters,
while Morningside has a ten second
youth, but the majority or traclr for
lowers here real that, with Kurt out.
Turner is the fastest man in the state.

In the hurdles, Bair, Mclntcsh and
Cross are the present candidates,
and with men lilre Brown oz Morning—
side, McCord of Dralre and Walker
and Hewitt oi Ames in the races,
Grinnell will do well it she wins as
many points in these events as last
year. McIntosh. who was not in school
last spring, should develop into a
good running mate ior Ealr.

In the jumps, also, Grinnell has
plenty oi worlr to do. In the high
jump, Slaght's absence seems to throw
the burden upon Wells, unless Cross
should he able to improve enough ov-
er his past work. It Wells can dupll.
cate his leap oi two years ago; at 5
feet 10 inches, he should talre it.

Knowles, Hair and Cross will take
care or the broad jump. Knowles
won the lump nvar Lambert at the
Amen duel last year and, u that was
his that year on the squad, should
iconit hlmaei: very creditably this
spring. Morton clerk, a point winner
for the past two years at state, has
I nplendldiopportunlty for testing the
event this year, since Haggard is out

In the distances and the half-mile,

the case, it will be a. complete revresal

Lastly, but hardly the lejlst import-
ant tor Griunell, are the weights.
Ziegler's Surprise last spring is siill
fresh in student mind. Further im-
provement on his pSrTL is expected.
Stutsman, oi Iowa; Sharnburg ot
Drake and Lambert oi Ames will give
good competition, but there is no rea-
Son to think that Ziegler will at least
duplicate his last year's performance.
The track schedule tor the spring
is about the same as in past years.
The Freshman, Soph., Dual, the Home

scrap believe that the scrap has been
productive ot wholesome class spirit,
and that it has been a clean, good-
natured contest. Having conildence
that the same spirit will continue to
prevail we believe that the arbitrary
restrictions should be reduced to a
minimum. We recommend as follows:

(1) The scrap shall occur on the 1st
Tuesday alter the General Reception
between 5 and 7 A.‘ M. it may cons
tiuue not more than (45) forty-ﬁve
minutes and shall end not later than

ACADEMY T0 DEBATE.

Iona We. all only Will Meet
the Glilmt‘ll Academy Ille L.
of March.

Three leal's ago Gl‘innell Academy
entered into an agreement for E. 56*
Tics of debates with the Academy of
Iowa Wesleyan University. in the
ﬁl‘si of these our representatives, C.
0: Edgiliglon, J. A. Wilson and H. C.
McKean, won a unanimous decision
detending the'use ot iederal injunCr
iions in labor disputes. Last year, W.
N. Tutile, .l. Lincoln and E. D. Baird

lnl savings bank, but returned with
the decision Standing unanimously in
favor of their opponents.

This year Grinnell Academy is de-
tm'mined to regain the laurels and [D
will the championship of the series.
It is again their privilege to entertain
the lows. Wesleyan representatives.
Tile reception committee consists nf
E. D. Baird, T. P. Vl'Elch and F. C.
Ellis. This year the question for dis»
cusslun is. "Resolved, That. the United
States Should adopt 3 parcels post
syslem, which is to be defended by
Iowa Wesleyan Academy. Although
the exact date is not yet ﬁxed, the can-
test will probably occur March 26.

Baird, who is leader ot the team,
did very eﬂicient work in last year's
debate; Welch was leader of ills
Drake Academy team which defeated
Simpson last year; Ellis has had two
years at high school experience. With
men of this ability and experience,
Coach Kinsley should turn out a. winv
ning team. The Grinnell Academy
team should give their opponents a
warm reception and win victory for
themselves and their school. In this
effort. [0 win this deciding contest,
Grinnell Academy may depend upon
the sympathy and support of every
student in Iowa College, In past
years [112 Academy debates have been
the training schools for 21. number of
prominent intercollegiate debaters.
MCGill, ’DX. and Kinsley, '09, are two
well known intercollegiate veterans
who received their early (raining on

2.1 tor Opponents.

The Cureslomathlaanreshnlan de-
bating team, composed or H. F. strong.
N. J. Breed and M. c. Harrison, met
a team representing Upper Iowa
ireshmen last night at Fayette and
was deieated 2 to 1, The question de-
bated was: “Resolved, That the Adop-
tion or the rliteentb Amendment was
Unwise." Grinnell upheld the aﬂirm-
ntivo. The debate was close and hard
tought, both sides oi the question be-
ing well presented. The Cbrestoma—
thlsn team was not as experienced in
debating as their opponents, but in
spite at this handicap, gave the Upper
iowa lads a good content.

Not long ago there was a severe
wind alarm at Kansas. The whistle
and Smokestack were blown from the
power house and the power was on {or
two days. Also a Senior girl was
blown from n' porch and muttered n
