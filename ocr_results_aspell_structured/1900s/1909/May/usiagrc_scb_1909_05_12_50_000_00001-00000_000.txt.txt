and assurance on the part or the nienr

in the Soldiers‘ Chorus oi the second
part, however, and it was rendered
with dash and vim, and plenty o1 vol-

Saturday, at the Haskins’ stadium

in Des Moines, G nnoll's ball tossers

dropped the first same ol the year with
L) the University by a score or 4-2.
’l‘hl tiet’cat comes as a distinct sur-
prise, and was largely due to the pitch»
ing and hitting oi McCoy, the Drake
star twirler.

Jztriingin, whose work thus iar has
been little short of phenomenal, start-
ed the same for Grinncll, but the blue
and white stick artists soon solved his
delivery, and secured their total of
tour rims in the ﬁrst and third inn<
ings, Smithson then took up the work
and was able to hold them witltout fur-
ther tallies, until the end of the game.

Grinnell did her scoring in the ﬁrst
and second, on hits by Brnndage, Jar-
nagin, Noll and \l'arrincr. Both teams
secured a total or seven hits, but those
by Drake had an unhappy tendency
to occur Just when men were on bases
because of walks or costly errors. Mm
Coy helped win his own game by a
couple of hits, one oi which was for
lhree bases. Jamagiu smashed out
two twoebaggers, but was caught at
third ti mg to stretch the last one to
three bases.
