Rev, Hill, who possesses a personal.

mands attention, oronght forth the

idea oi the value of individualism, in
so clear, so forceful and personal a
way, that there are ieu‘ indeed of those

who listened to his thought, expressed
in pure, simple English, who will not
car ' away a lasting impression of the
power of the man as well as a new
conception of the absolute uniqueness
of the self, and the importance of the
cultivation of the natural gifts with
which every individual is endowed. It
is comforting to think of one's self as
possessing gifts distinctly his own.
That each man, u'oi'nun, and child. does
possess such gifts, says Dr. Hill, is as
certain as it is that day follows night
Cultivate those gifts.

Address lie/ore Assacinll‘mi,

The address of President Davis was a
perfect supplement to that of Dr. Hill,
“Dr, Hill has told you that you have
gifts," he said, “and that it is your
duty to perfect them. Perfection is
the keynote of what i have to say to
you,” Then in a strong, forceful man
ner, he unfolded his plan of action,
uhich leads to perfection. There are
two questions to be asked concerning
What is it? and what is it

basis of intellectrral and moral excelc
leuce. And in this connection Presi-
dent Davis took the opportunity of»
tered, to criticize present day college
athletics as becoming too nmch spec
cia d. "The purpose of college atlr
letics should he to better the physical
condition of every student," he said
But college athletics of today is con
lined lo a few men who do our tralue
lug and playing for rrs. Modern cola

of “bleacher athletics."

the right, and acting in accordance
with our discernment, The discerning
process is fully as important for rnor»
alrty, as the doing. The last great es
sential for perfection is spirituality.

This is what periection is, but were
it an end in itself it would defeat its
own end. True perfection consists in
making use of itself, and thus becomes
perfection in the real sense or the
word, a college education is a train-
ing tor perrection, and perfection is
realized only in service, in giving away
one's self, which is the greatest gift
that can be made.

up Mr. Sundrtv as a dcrnigod, inspired

H, Glenn Kinsley, ‘05, of Chresto-

peal for a halt in the policy of naval
expansion. “At the same time that the
great efforts for international peace
and arbitration are belng made, there
goes on a mad rush for larger navies.
This militarism is foolish, wasteful,
hypocritical and arouses dangerous an-

Tire most radical departure, as it
will doubtless be viewed by the stu-

price of subscription of the magazine
from one dollar to a dollar and a half
per year, This is a change th.t was
made only after long and careful can<
