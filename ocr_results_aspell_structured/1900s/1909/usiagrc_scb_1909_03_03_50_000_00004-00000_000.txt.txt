Interesting Facts.

Through the courtesy ot the Colfax
Consolidated Cost 00., Protessor Con-
ard and his Geology class had the priv-
elege at seeing recently the source of
some ot the coal burned here. Mere
Sightseer: cannot get access to the
mine, tor the managers are too busy
to look alter them. But as this perry
represented tile geology class oi Iowa
College, they were shown all the ins
and outs or coal mining.

About five miles out trom Coliax is
the No. a mine. The party who cared
tor here by three oi the best intormed
[oi'emen oi the mine. They were ﬁrst
let down the shalt one hundred and
seventy teet, in total darkness, on a
miners' "cage" or freight elevator.
Then, with lamps in hand, they walk-
ed tor two hours in entries and gala
ler-ies under ground. First came the
stables where twentyuﬁvc sninll mules
were comtortably housed and cared
for. The place was warm and meals
:tnt. but absolutely dark most oi the
time. The miles or passages oi the
mine contain no water. The ground
is dry and dusty. But the rocks are

besutirul tesioons oi moulds and other
rungi. The coal Vein is unite a think
one. It Was tolloived up and down in
gentle hills and volleys. Below is a
white "ﬁre clay," and above a grey oi-
black slate. Numerous reetures or the
greatest technical interest were shown
to the visitors, making very real mnny
at the most tnndamentnl principles or
earth structure. The educational vol.
us or such an experience to nature
students can hurdly be over estimat-
cd, end the party cannot spank too
highly of the kindness and courtesy

shown them by their several hosts.
