Football.

The candidates on the gridiron
are getting down to a little stead-
ier and harder work by this time,
Nearly all the members of the
old “scrub" team of last year are
back again, which is not only an
encouraging but almost a neces
sary fact if we are to have any
kind of a 'Varsity.

Capt. Douglass and Fiske are
the only two men of last year's
'Varsity on the gridiron at present
writing. Lyman did not return to
school. leaving the position of
left end vacant. Fellows has not
yet returned, leaving the position
of tackle, which he was counted
upon to ﬁll, vacant. These two
unexpected vacancies put the
team in a still more dilapidated
condition. our one hope lies in
last year's scrubs and in tlle new
material. Coach Harris has been
unexpectedly delayed again. He
had fully planned to be present
the ﬁrst of this week. but unforer
seen circumstances will not permit
him to take charge of the men
until Monday next. However
"Jack" is tast putting the men into
condition,which will enable Coach
Harris to begin at once upon the
important work of coaching the
team. Last night, although
showers fell at intervals, the men
were divided into two sqiiads, and
spent most at the time in running
signals. The showing of some of
the new material is remarkably
good, and, if present indications
are fulﬁlled. will bring them
special mention betorc the season
is over. But the fact still remains
that the ﬁrst game is only ten
days distant, and the teams have
had no opposition whatever.

The football season at the unis
versity may be said to have ale
ready opened. A squad ofseven-
ty-ﬁve men have been in training
at Lake Minnetonka for the past
two weeks. The work down there
has put the men as tar in advance
in their training as they have been
in former years in the middle of

the season—Minnesota Daily.

 

Some'or Uul’ Neighbors.

The Minnesota Daily is respon
sible for the statement that the
football outlook in Iowa Univer»
sity is not as promising as was ex.
pected earlier in the season. New
material, from which vacancies
were expected to be ﬁlled was not
attracted to the degree hoped for.
Under the four year rule, no mem-
ber of last year’s team, who will
continue in the University with
the exception of quarterback
Williams, will be elegible. In
view of the crying need for ma-
teriai from which to select play-
ers for 1901. so the Minnesota
Daily continues, especial atten»
tlon will will be given to the sec-
ond team this year. every mem-
ber of which must be a man who
will be likely to make good ﬁrst
team material next year.

A number of candidates for the
Minnesota Varsity team spent the
two weeks previous to the open-
ing week at Lake Minnetonka,
where they got into good condi-
tion for early practice. The ﬁrst
game of the season was played
last Saturday at Minneapolis.
The complete schedule has been
announced, and beginning with
Sept. 15, contains a game for
every week up to Thanksgiving
Day.

School opened Aug. 28th at
Ames, and football practice has
been under full swing ever since
The graduate system of coaching
has been dropped,and Mrr Wood-
rul‘f, formerly of Pennsylvania and
now athletic director at the State
College, has charge of the men.
Coach Woodruff states that there
is an abundance of heavy men for
the line and speedy youths for the
back ﬁeld. Captain Chambers
says he has never seen so many

good men come in with the fresh
man class, which is the largest in
the history of the school.
