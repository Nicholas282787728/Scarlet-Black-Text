The Bendix concert.

The third number on the Y. M.
C. A, lecture course, the Max
Bendix Concert company. den
lighted a Grinnell audience last
evening. by rendering the best
musical program which has been
given in the city this year. Mr.
Bendix was at his best and his
rend‘ on of the Faust Fantasie
called forth hearty applause, to
which he graciously responded
with a short encore In both of
his other numbers Mr. Bendix
showed his rare ability in execu-
tion and technique. His interpre»
tation of the melodious Hungar-
ian airs was especially enjoyable
to the audience. The members of
the company gave able support
to Mr. Bendix and left little to be
desired,

Mr.- Carberry was a tavorite with
the audience from the Gist, His
rendition or the Aria from “The
Prodigal Son” brought out the
marvelous range of his voice and
drew forth a storm of applause
from the audience. The numbers
the “Rosary” and “Song of Ac-
tion” appealed to the sympathies
of the audience and showed that
Mr. Carberry is not only the pose
sessor of a rich, powertul voice,
but is in complete harmony with
his hearers at. all times.

The other vocal numbers of the
program were rendered by Miss
De Sellem, rvho possesses a sweet
contralto voice of great powerand
range. In the Aria irom “Sampr
son and Delilah" Miss Dc Sellem
was at her best, but failed to
awaken the interest of the att~
dience, The number composed
of three short selections was ap
preciated more, and Miss De Sela
lem responded to a vigorous ens
core.

The accompanist, Mrss Emily
Parsons, gave two exc llent nunr
bers on the piano. Her accome
paniments were skrlltully ren-
dered.

 

crinnell will be gladto welcome
tlrrs company again. The program
rendered is given below.

Grinnell Institutes

The Sophomores took their reg-
ular turn at the helm last Wede
rtesday evening, and rendered a
program which covered all the
ground between the sublime and
thepureiy humorous. The “roast"
so blandly perpetuated in the Sen-
ror program some weeks ago,
seemsto have given an irresisitble
impetus to the tad of cracking
jokes about our staid and steady
Seniorsijokes, most striking for
their cleariiess and lucrdrty, The
sophomores. if possible, but adds
ed impetus to the tad, and lucky

Theﬁist number wasa sollloquy.
given by Don Foster.‘ He was
studying aloud, and it was inter-
esting to notice how, even in the
minds of the best of students,
thought runs riot and imagination
soars to unknown heights.

Miss Atkinson sang a very pret-
ty solo, which was well received
and appreciated by thc socrety.

Ntillen read selections from
Pres. Hyd‘c’s “Series of Lette ,"
written by a boy during his career
in college. Close attention was
given the selections, as somciin»
dccd many of the sentiments ex»
pressed therein, were recognized
as familiar to the different meme
bets, The sketches were true to
life and not overdrawnr '

 

The question of the discussion
was, Resolved, that college fra»
ternities 0| clubs die desirable.
Blatltcrwick afﬁrmed that, as man
is a social being, clubs of limited
members should be formed, in
which comr-adeship can be fos-
tel'edr And,as positive prootthat
such comradeship will result, he
cited examples otour seniors and
their increasing sociability. I’ct-
ersondenied that “frats” were cone
tlucive to the good or college
men, supporting his statement
rvrtlr lacts such as loss of sleep,
increasedcxpensesand bad habits.

Miss Millard favored the socie-
ty with two piano selections, for
which due and hearty thanks were
returned. r

The evening's program reached
the sublime inalecture by Digiian
“The Inner Man.” Applause
e, ol‘led him to the ﬂoor, alter
which the society preserved a re-
spectful silence while with ﬂuent
tongue and spicy thought he ex-
pounded his ideas orr that subject.
It was the hit of the evening.

Van Dike's talk on the “Block
System” of railways was very in-
structive upon a topic comparae
trvely new and rarely understood
it! America. A brief history of
its invention and growth was give
en and its efﬁcacy in preventing
railroad accidents.

This concluded the sophomore
program. Their eitorts were not
in vain.

Ellis,

The opening number ol the at-
ternoon’s program was a solo by
Mrs, Whitcomb, which was ren-
dcred in her usual charming man-
net and met with hearty applause.
The second ol the Senior pro-
grams was given under the man-
agement of May McClanahan. and
consisted of a Japanese wedding
in pantomime. The bride was rep
resented by Inez Woodtord, while
Oswald Risser took the place of
the groom. Tire bride's simple
costume of white, with only a
toncli of yellow, contrasted in a
pleasing way with the bright cose
tuines of the attendants. The
constant bowing on the part of the
attendants, as they gave greeting
to the bride and groom and served
them with drinks, was well done
