A recent article in the 1.5.0, Siluloa
brings to light an agitation which has
long troubled rlrehcarlsoimanyoi our
Ames friends. They bemoan the fact
that many or their iacnlty are taking
unto themselves helpmates (not that
sich a worthy movement should be
condemned) but that there is no pro»
vision ror housing these charges in a
manner becoming their position. It

AN EXCELLENT ENTERTAINMENT

During the week which ended last

Iowa College Glee Club would not only'
come lully up to the standard or excel.

which followed was not vigorous it
was persistent enough to Show that
the eﬂol‘t was not unapprecioted and
to secure for the audience an encore
in lighter vein. That the simpler and
more melodious renditions were more
enthusiastically received than the
more pretentious pieces, such as the

obvious commentary on the prevailing
taste which can be deduced from the
general attidude or the audience.

The week just closing has been very
lruitllll in chapel talks and was end-
eil very ilttingiy by {t tall: Thursday
by Doctor C. H. Haas and Friday by
President Bradley. Mr. Haas is
Traveling Secretary or the Student
Volunteer Movement ' and has the
commendation of all Y. M. C. A. men.
He chose a very suitablesubject ior il's

lege bled per-son has over the un-
tutored in the World outside of college.
With the college graduate it is not
a. question of ajnb but of a career. He

all pointing to success. This puts
some respousi llty upon him. Every
normal man or woman should enioy
the struggle necessary to overcome a
difﬁcult situation. He should longfor i
a chance to match hisstrength against
a worthy opponent. The speaker
spoke with contempt and considerable
hardness of the man who is willing to
live, a iiie or ease and luxury, exerting
no positive inﬂuence, a continual con»
sumer and never a producer. Mr. Haas
is a ready speaker and fired his audi-
ence With 2. portion of his own enthu-

siasm for his subject.

President Bradley spoke upon 3. sub—
ject which is being widely discussed
today in pulpit and newspaper, the
proposed gift of one hundred thousand
dollars to the American Board of
Foreign Missions by John D. Rocke-
roller. Doctor Bradley expressed his
views on the matter Very lucidly and
at the same time voiced a few gener-
al truths which are just coming into
recognition. Th e early Christian
