Preliminary Debates.

The preliminary Chrestomathi-
an debate to select a speaker for
the interrsoerety debate next fall
was held in Chresto hall last Wed-
nesday evening, and was pros
nounced by all who heard it as
exceptionally strong. It was unr
doubtedly one of the best debates
that has been held on the ﬂoor
of Cllrestomathia for some time,
The fact that the same three
speakers who represented our 50'
ciety last fall were again chosen
as this year’s team, spoke much
for the training they received in
the former debatts and insures a
strong experienced team. The
question debated was: Resolved
7“Tnat the Government should
construct an extension system of
irrigation works for the arid
western lands.” There iverc eight
speakers, each choosing his own
side of the question and own
manner of treatment. All the
speakers spoke on the afﬁrmative
of the question and with surpris-
ing unanimity defended national
ownership and control as opposed
either to private or state regular
tion. The question was rather
a diﬁ‘icult one but the debaters
showed such a mastery or the
subject, and their treatment in
the main so forceful, as to come
mand the entire attention oithe
audience, According to the
rankings or the eight judges who
marked the speakers on their ei-
fectiveness as debaters: E. F.

 

Den on was given ﬁrst plac S.
H, Crosby second. H. S. Dickin-
son third, and C. R. Barnard as
alternate.

Grinnell Institute.

Wednesday evening the Grin.
ncll Institute held its preliminary
for the selection of debaters for
the inter-society debate to be
held with the Chrestomathian
society early in the fall. The
question for debatewas as rollows:
Resolved, "Thatthc United States
should construct an extensive
system of irrigation for the arid
lands ot the west,” the same ques»
tion it willbe seen as the Chresr
tomathian society debated. There
were in all six debaters, three
supporting the nihimative while
the other three upheld the nega-
tive. The debate was very logic-
ally arranged and was well argued
on both sides. Moreover prepa~
ration was made in delivery as
was evinced by the way the speaks
ers conducted themselves upon
the ﬂoor.

The fact that out of the six den
haters all but one were inexperi-
enced in society debates shows
plainly that debating is being
taken hold oi by under classmcn
and this certainly augurs well for
the future of the society. Some
of the new men proved to be
strong on the ﬂoor and with a
little experience will make good
inter-collegiate debaters. The
judges, Professor Macy, Johnson
and \thitconib selected the speak-
ers as follows: Arnold, James
and Lyman with mini as an al-
ternate, while the society voted
the debate in the favor of the
aFﬁrrnative.

The Junior Annual.

The work of the junior Annual
board is nearly over. The books
arrived today and will be dis
tributed next Monday. That the
annuals have been eagerly await.
ed, no one can deny; whether they
will prove satisfactory in every
wayremains to be seen. That all
will be satisﬁed, is not expected;
but that this dissatisﬁed element
will be at all large. is very imr
probable. The difﬁculties in the
way of producing a successful
book of this kind in a school of
this size, are almost insurmount-
able, but the present annual board
have succeeded in a very satis-
factory manner. The handsome
cover, of neat design, the good
illustrations, and interesting read
ing matter make it a very credits
able piece of work,
