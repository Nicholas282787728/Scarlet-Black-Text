it was never the intention that the

and we feel theretore that many have
a just right to Complain againstrecent
practices which hare shown an ex.
cessive etiort to give away the cmetetl

Janna" seth 1904's edition or
scanner AS): Enron and glance down
the editorial column he will liild there,
beginning a series or editorial com-
ments on the distinctiveness of the
honor “G ' At that time tiie class of
loci adopted a similar emblem for a
class pin and the editorials assume
the form criticisms oi the practice
or using the letter “G” so promiscous-
ly without proper regard ior it in tire
capncit) for nhich it was ciioosen by
the Atheletlc Union. The criticisms
excited much comment and replies
will also be iound there in deiense oi
the action. The class could not be in-
duced to lay aside the adopted emblem
built resented bitterly the charge or
intending to desecrate the honor “G"
or in any way make it more common,
and consequently less desirable prop-
erb'

It is not the purpose here to revive
this old question We wish only to
recall this i‘act, nliich has been true
in every instance involving the same,
or similar issues, Both parties were
equally insistent. upon making clear
tlleii‘ position or esteem and regard
for the highly special iiliietioiioi the
honor ”0" and were one in the senti-
menu that it should retain itsciiiaii
pedestal" upon which the Athletic
Union placed it. We believe that the
student body today is no less enthus-
astic over the wearers oi the honor
"G i when it is yustiy awnided than

those of former Years {mil we likewise ‘

believe that the) resent \ViLli no less
