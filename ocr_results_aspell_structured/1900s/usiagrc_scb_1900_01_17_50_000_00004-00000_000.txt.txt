The London Glee Singers.

A rather small but expectant
atidlcncc greeted the Lcndun Glee
Singels, Monday evening. Their

as il unset several phases and pel-
iods ui English lite. Costume.
appropriate to the several pctiods
added much to an otherwise inter
esting progiam. The audience
were glad to listen to English
songs composed as early as 1595.
and at various other periods of
English history.

The unaccompanied glee of the
ﬁve singers, “Sleep. Gentchady.”
was much enjoyed, the voices liar
monizing pleasantly.

Of the solo work. the numbers
most pleasing to the audience
seemed to be those of Miss Jones
and Mr. Hyett. The ccntraltn
voice of Miss Jones showed itself
to good advantage in “The
Drowned Lover.” a ballad found
in piint as early as 167I.

Several humorous sketches inr
terested and greatly amused the
audience. Aniongtliese“Riclinr(l
of Taunton Dene" and “Widde

combe Fair," as rendered by Mr,
Hyett, are noteworthy.

The Athletic Union cue to be
congratulated on the unique value
and charm otthe entertainment as
a whole.
