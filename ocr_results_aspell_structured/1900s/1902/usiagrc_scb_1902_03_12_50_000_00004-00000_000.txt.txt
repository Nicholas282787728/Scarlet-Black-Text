of the best numbers on the course.
Thedemand lor seals did not seem
to be affected by the large titlin-
ber of functions which have been
hcld reccnlly and will be held so
soon after the donccrt.

With the exception of Mr. Carr
berry the members or the troupe

Mr, Carbeiry will be remembered
as giving a recital last year with
Mary Wood Chase.

heard him. He has a pure lyric
voice and shows a ﬁne artistic
temperament in hisinterpretation.
The rest of the company have yet

expect to be very favorably im-

A glance at the program which
has been submitted showsa pleasr

BASEBALL AT DRAKE.

no school in Iowa that has better
material for the nrgani ttion ot a
ﬁrst class ball team, lhcrc is a
healthy interest among a large
number ot the young men, who in
years past have been more or less
devoted to the old popular game
The management may ﬁnd it a
little difﬁcult to airange a satis-

season, but irom all reports we
look forward to a silcccssful sea»
