BASEBALL AT GRINNELL

Good Prospects for a Better Team Than
Last YeaHWorh in the cryrnna-
sium has Begun.
As the spring season approach-
irilcrcst in the game begins to
revive. Although football has take
en the chiel place among college
games and track athleticss hare
the interest of students in the
spring. baseball sttil has a warm
place in the heart of the college
athlete. Gi‘ii’inell has had a base
ball team for about tliirtyrﬁve
years and has seen season of de
teat and seasons of Victory. Last
year Grinneil baseball was rioi
satisfactory to students or friends.
The home games were played on
the carnptrs.witliout any enclosure
and were titter failures l‘iiianciaily,
ince'entrdnce fees could not be
collected trotn those who watched
the game frornthe sidewalk across
the sheet or from the library
windows. Besides this the team
seemed to be in poor condition
most of the season.
ltishopedtliatthis spring‘s bases
ball will not have these evils to
contend with. The diamond at
\Vai'tl Field will he lcveletloffand
