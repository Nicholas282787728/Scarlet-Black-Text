HE effort that is being made
to establish a traditional

Senior day for Commencement
week, by giving the graduating
classa larger part in the Com-
mencementexercises.is eminently
the proper thing to do. It ought
to meet with favor on every hand.
In spite of the fact that Iowa Col-
lege is over a halt century old,
there are no traditional class day
exercises, The graduating class,
which in the ordinary Commence
mentshould be the center of at-
traction, has had a very insigniﬁ-
cant part to play. It is not to be
wondered at that the students‘ in-
'terest in Commencement has been
waning, and that the majority of
them have been going home as
soon as the classroom work was
ended. The only way to prevent
this is to arrange programs that
will appeal to the students and
createin them a newinterest. This
can be done to a great extent, we
believe, by giving a greater pi‘omir
hence to the student part of the
ceremonies. We are glad to see
this attempt made this year, ale
though the need tor something of
the kind will not be so great as
usual, because of the inauguration
of President Bradley which will
occur nextJune. The Commence
ment exercises of this year will be
exceptional in this respect, and
will emphasize strongly the need
of more elaborate and more inter-
esting programs ior tuture years.

old as our own college have Come

The Colonial on time Friday
night. in order tltat the concert
may begin promptly at the time
stated. There, has seemed to be
a growing tendency on the part of
those in the college to be late at
public meetings, and considerable
annoyance has resulted therefrom.
This no doubt has been due large-
ly to carelessness. If so, it ought

easily to be remedied.

AFTERMATH on cHRESTo-ELLIS
PLAY.

ATRONS of the lecture

Although a large amount of
money was not cleared by the
management of Pudd’nhead \Vii'
son, on account of the heavy ex~
pense of presenting the play, the
result on the whole was very satis
factory to the societies. Alter
all bills are paid a neat little sum
will be left to be turned into
the society treasuries and it is
probable that this will be ex
pended in improving Chresto
Hall. Forsome time improve
ments have been contemplated,
such as putting in a new hardwood
Floor, the purchase of new curtains
and repapering thewalls and some
of these will probably be begun
at once. Both societies feel that
the play was sueeesstul beyond
their expectations and that the
proceeds could not be better we
pended than in brightening their
society home.
