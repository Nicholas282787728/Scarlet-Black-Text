T is not given to all men to be
t] scliolais Notwithstanding
the rather common opinion that
the college graduate should know
about all that is to be known. it
still remains true tlrat a college
training cannot make a scholar of
every student that avails hin elt
of its opportunities, TliCI'L is
one thing, however. which the
college lite can do for all who
have a share in it. unless thwarted
by the individual's own character.
which is or much greatei
quence to the life of the world
than merely a highly developed
intellect. It can give spirit to
students, and spitit is the essen
tial thing. It is spirit
maiksthe difference between a
good and a had life; between real
success and tailui-c. The college
tire is capable or developing the
right kind of spirit in every one
who will open his soul to its in
nucnces. The possession ottiiis
spirit means breadth of vision;
bigness ot mind and heart. It
means a sympathetic nature, and
the ability to appreciate the other
tellow's point ot view. and many
other desirable qualities. which
need not be mentioned. The sad
tact remains. however, that the
college life docs not always inculr
cate this spirit. Occasionally is
seen a man. who has enjoyed the
privilegesotcollege and univets
sity liie. but who is sadly lacking
in this respect; who is a thorough
student and air excellent scholar,
but who. iiiith all his hnowlcdgc,
is tiarrow and unsympathetic. A
man may be sticcesstnl in his pres
fession. and be admired for his
learning. and yet, in the language
of the street. be a “tn-orby tour.”
It is important hit the student tti
keep this tact in mind, dining his
college days. A mini is always
pieteraolc to a mere scholar.
There is no ieason. however. why
a man should not be both a man
and a schtilai of ilo mean ability
—:i result. to attain which should
be the ambition of every college
student.
