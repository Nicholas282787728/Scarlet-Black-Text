part from early American psalms

has ever prevailed in the whole
history of church music, the tunes,

Saturday, Nov, l5. Mr Slinson.
of Cornell, met members of the
Debating Union and the intercol-
legiate debating compact was (lis-
cussed, Giiiiiiell Levers the Har-

between the eastern schools, and
is gaining ground in the west.
while Cornell favors the old syse
tern, which has no separate rebute
ting speeches except for the [earl
ers and those only short ones. No
conclusion was reached on this
point, tho several minor matters
were arranged. Monday after
noon the Deba’ling Union held a
meeting to consider this matter
or the time and orderot speakers.
Both schools are strongly in favor
of their systems and the matter
may cause considerable dissatise
[action before it is settled.
