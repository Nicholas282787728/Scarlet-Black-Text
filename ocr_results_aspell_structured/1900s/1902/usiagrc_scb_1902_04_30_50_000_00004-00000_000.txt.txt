LAST CALL FOR THE DEBATE,
The massmeetitlg yesterday
afternoon was well attended by
the studentbody. Even a foot-
ball massmeeting on the eve at a
game with Drake or lowa would
hardly have drawn a larger crowd
The meeting was opened with the
old “Grillnell we yell", given with
the customary vim, speeches
were made by Prof. Nollcn, Presr
iderit Bradley and Mr. Stipp.

The lteynote of the addresses
was an appeal to the student
body to rally to the support of
the college in the coming clash
with Washburn. Our past record
need not again be relerred to.
We have met many defeats—de-
feats which we have keenly te|t~
but with the old Grinnell spirit of
do-your-besband keep-still, we
have never ceased from our cfr
forts to win victory for the col»
legs, and Grilinell will continue
this process till sooner or later
she gains her proper place in der
hating as in other lines.

This is the spirit which
possessed our debaters in the
past and which animtites our
present team. They have work»
ed as hard and faithfully as any
team that ever carried the scarlet
and black, whether in debate or
athletics. The team has done its
share: it now remains for the
students to do theirs. The team
will do its duty this evening: the
students should do the same.

If our representatives need the
cooperation of the school in
order to. \\'in athletic contests.
tnuch more do they need it in
contests of this sort. Everyone
knows the value of a grandstand
Full of enthusiastic routers in winr
hing a ball game or' track meet.
The encouragement or enthusias-
tic, friendly rooters is still more
essential in an OratOrlCal or debate
ing contest. No speaker can do

has

 

his best when talking to empty
seats or inattentive listeners. Let
us be generous to our opponents
and loyal to our team. Let every
one turn out and root for old
Grinnell and the team that repre-
sents her this evening.
