It is a story of life in Missouri be-
tore the war, and although a very
long play is one in which the inter-
est never lags trom beginning to
end. The droll wit and combined
stupidity and Shrcivdncss of Wil-
son, the passionatcdlgnity of Roxy
and the coldeblooded cruelty of
Tom Driscoll are used in the story
to make a plot intensely’interestr
ing and real. The human interest
that runs through the play arouses
the sympathy or every member ol
the audience, and everyone waits
breathiessly for Pudd'n Head, in
his Slow but sure way, to solve the
difﬁculty by discovering the real

FOOTBALL SCHEDULE.

Manager H. S. Dickinson has
made the following statement with
regard to football matters: “The
success or Grinnell during the
past season has considerably in-
creased her prominence in root.
ball circles. Thc.State Universi-
ties ot Missouri and South Dakota
have both asked tor games as well
as Knox College ot Galeshurg.
Ill., and the iowa State Normal
School. The dates now open on
the schedule will probably be

 

ﬁlled with one of these schools.
The prospects tor another proﬁtr
able season are excellent.” And.
indeed, on the whole, last season
was one of the most successful
Grinnell has ever experienced.
Only one defeat and one tie, which
was later wiped out by an over-
whelming victory. is a record not
to be ashamed oi. since only one
game, excepting that with the
alumni, was played with a college
having a smaller number of stu-
dents than Grinnell, And this
with half the team new nicn to
’Varsity football. BeSldcs this
success on the gridiron the season
was one of the most proﬁtablc,
ﬁnancially. that Grinnell has ever
had. Alter all expenses
paid a goodly surplus was lett roi-
thc treasury of thc AtlilcticUnion.

All this points to another suce
ccsslul team. Four of the Van
Sity will graduate and will not be
easily replaced. yet the second
team this yearillcludcd some very
encouraging material. Another
thing which was perhaps the most
pleasing of last fall's successes
was the revival of the genuine old
Giinncll spirit. The support oi
the student body was the thing
needed most by the team and it
was heartily given. This spirit is
what will bring men out, and make
their training faithful, and catlsc
the team to ﬁght a losing game
to the bitter end.

The provisional schedule tor
next year is as follows:

Sept. eo, Alumni game at Grinnell,

Sept. 27. Open.

Oct. 4, Exhibition game with Drake at
