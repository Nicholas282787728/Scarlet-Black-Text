very kindly and generous action
of our advertisers, iii consenting
to the omission of their advertise-

sent was not given grudgingly,
but with the greatest cordiality.
and through their' kindness it was
possible to devote the whole paper
to matters of interest to the alumr

again their worthiness ot all the
students' patronage. and we earn-

EXT Sunday is the day which
will he observed itl Grinnell
as the Day or Prayer. in many
respects this is the most important
day in the whole collegeyear, and
it is ﬁtting that some prepaiation
for it should be made by the stu~
dents. It affords an excellent op
portunity to pause a little in the
hurry ot our school lite and give
some real attention to the needs
of our moral natures. Whatever
religious views we may hold, the
conviction is strong in all that
our moral iiatuies need as caieful
training as do the physical and in

called religious or not, it is recog-
nized by all, that one who fails to

development of the highest type
of character, and there can be no
diFferencc of opinion on the neces-
sity of occasionally taking a little
time tor serious, sober thought up-
on this, the greatest of the ques-
tions which come to us for solur
tion. The effect of the Day of
Prayer should be revealed in the
clearer and larger visions which
come to us after a day’s earnest
meditation.

The guests were next given an ape
portunity to display their ability
in making hats of pink and white
tissue paper, When the charming
creations resulting had been suFﬁ-
ciently admired, a few ofGibson's
most characteiistic sketches were
reproduced. The evening closerl

which interval refreshments were
served. The entire evening pmr
vided most enjoyable social inter—
course ror those present.

THE FRESHMAN PARTY.

Friday night's Freshmen party
proved to be a very enjoyable af-
fair. The program took the
form of the last day exercises ata
district school, To say the least
it was enthusiastically carried out.
Perhaps the rniscluevousness of
the country school boy was a triﬂe
exaggerated by the deportnient
of the school, perhaps the rube
band which did such terrible jus-
tice to "A Hot Time” was an un-
usual scene tor a country school
house, but the spirit and dress of
the children were typical and
everybody madethebestofthecir-
cumstanees. Last but not least
were the refreshments, Both the
Chresto and Institute halls were
used. The party was chaperon—
ed by Protessors Millard. Nollen
and Willard.
