1L iollowrng item is taken

from last Saturday's /. 5,
C. 51mm: "In reviewing the last
year's successes and looking to-
ward the inture. SCARLET AND
BLAcKsays: ‘Anotllerthingavhich
was perhaps the most pleasing or
last fall’s successes, was the reviv-
al ofthe genuine old Glinnell spir-
it. The support of the student
body was the thing needed most
by the team, and it was heartily
given.‘ Then why schedule but
one home game, Grinnell? That
don't speak well for student sup

port."

CARLIiT AND BLACK is
cxceedinglysmrytllal Iowa

and Grinncll are not to meet ill a
dual track contest this spring, But
still more do we regret the way in
which tllis result has been brought
about. we are unwilllng to be-
lieve that the students at [he uni-
versily ‘will approve of the attitude
which Manager l\‘1cCutcheon has
taken. The reason assigned tor
the .breaking of the compact is
that Captain Anderson is opposed
‘ to scheduling twp dual meets, hut
there is some redson for believing
that this reason does not cover the
whole ground. Six‘dual meets be
tween the two schools have been
held, without interruption, until
last year when. for not very clear
ly deﬁned reasons, Ion-a reiused to
scheduletheannualcontest. Again
this year she has refused a meet,
SCARLET AND BLACK believes that
future dual meets should depend
.upon Iowa’s taking the initiative.

FROM PASTORATE TO PRES].
DENCY.

Michigan Congregationalists :ue
wrestling with plide and with re
gret: pride that Iowa college has
found in her-ministerial fraternity
the ideal ruzln fora president, and
regret that his acceptance of the
honor takes him from the static to
which for ten years he has given
unspal‘ing devotion and most imr
portatit service.

Dr. Bradley is a triend ol every
body. Hecarricsthe conﬁdence of
mole ministers’ trials and laymen‘s
tribulations than any other man
in the state. His heart and study
doors are always open, and some
body is, crossing the threshold
most of the time. His interest in
the churches is ever keen, and it
is his joy in all denominational
adoption and progress to lake the
initiative.

Dr. Bradley is unusually alert
mentally. The world is his parish,
and his eagle eye sweeps ‘the
generous horizon, and rastens a
discriminating gaze on that which
is prophetic. [-ie appreciates real
values; he welcomes new revelar
lions. Dr. Bradley can tl'il ter-
ribly. Intense and unremitting
in his work. he can carry great
burdens with good Cheer. and al-
ways has the gracious inspiration
of uncompromising optimism to
lend in unmeasured quantity to
any drab spirit he may chance to
meet.

Genial, versatile, capable. many-
sidcd. he will carry to Iowa Col-
lege the genius of leadership. and
will leave in Michigan 3 memory
and influence which will call him
back to the state whenever Cone
gregationalists appoint bishops.~
