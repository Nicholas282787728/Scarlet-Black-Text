Grim-tell, iowa. Saturday. Sept. 27. rgoo

AST evening theYoung Peo-
E ple’sCliristlanAssociations
ot Grinnell gave a union social
and reception to the students in
the reception rooms of the Con-
gregational church. This is an
annual event that is much enjoy-
ed by the young people of town
and college. It is of more than
ordinary importance because it
is evidence of the best sort that
there is no longer even a trace of
that jealousy between town and
college, which in days gone by
has caused so much trouble. Col-
lege and town ought. to be thor-
oughlyinterestedineacholherand
mutually helptui. Atter all they
owe a great deal to each other
and it can be said with truth that
nowhere is a college town more
loyal to an institution of learning
than Grinnell to Iowa College.
ivhile students almost without exs
ception, recognize and apprectate
the loyalty and interest of the
townspeople in all |liiiigs pertain-
ing to the college till all lines oi
separation have disap p e are d.
There never was a valid reason
for such a separation and artiﬁcial
barriers have long disappears
ed much to the beneﬁt of
both town and school. As
students we should try to pres
serve this status or things as it is.
We owe the people at Grinnell

soreat deal and should make an
effOrt to return in every way pos
sible. the interest and supportthc
college receive from the town.

OW is the time for old stu-
dents to do a little toward
miking things easy ior new ones.
The receptions are past, hard work
is upon all and the drag comes
now. The excitement and novel-
ty otthe ﬁrst few days is wearing
off and homesickness will he at its

worst during the next ten weeks.
