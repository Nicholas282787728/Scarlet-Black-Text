RE there quitters at Grin-
ncll? Howdoesithappen

that part of the time there are not
enough men out tortootoall prac-
tice to make a second team. This
is not the spirit that will win suc-
cess in any work. Every man
who can do so should be out now
for this is the time when the team
mus thavc help to win the rest of
itsgames. There must be asecond
team to iurnish opposition. See
and team men should look for-
ward to seasons to come. The
practise of this season will count
in developing a winning team
next year. But right here and
how men are needed on the footr
ball held every evening. The
men are in college and there will
be a few times when faithful work
will show a better college spirit.
It takes nerve to support a losing
team. Is that the trouble now?
surely not and now is the time to
make a special effort to strength-

en the team.
THE SOPHOMORE PARTYr

In spite of the rainy weather
last evening about eighty of the
Sophomore class assembled at
Blair Hall and were transported by
means of hayracks to the home of
S. A. Longley, three miles from
town.

The party was in the nature of
a barn warming. The huge harn
was decorated in the '05 colors,
while Jack o’ lanterns lent a hal~
lowe'cn effect to the scene.

After a short time devoted to
various games. refreshments of
pumpkin pie. doughnuts. apples
and cider were served.

Miss Raymond. Miss Fisher. Mr.
Heidel. Mr. Rusk and Mr. Nollen
represented the faculty.

CONVENTION AT CEDAR RAPIDS.

The college. railroad. and city
Young Men's Christian Associa-
tions of the state will meet in
their regular biennial convention
at Cedar Rapids on February
19722, 1903. The convention at
Burlington two years ago was the
strongest ever held in the state

winter promises by its program
to be even stronger. Among those
who have promised their attends
ance are Mr. Fred B. Smith. Mr.
E. T. Colton. Western College
Secretary; Mr. E. L. Hamilton.
of the International Committee
and Mr. S. D. Gordon. of Cleve-
land, Ohio. who conducts the
quiet hours.

CLASS 1N SIGHT SINGING.

Once a week Professor Olds
gives an hour in choral singing to
members ot the college. and to
this class all students are admitted
without charge. The class. which
was instituted last year. offers a
splendid opportunity ior work by
those who cannot devote more‘
time to music. and will probably
be much larger this year than last.
The classis held in the south room
of the School of Music each Mon-
day afternoon.

gliding“:

Rev. Geo. F. Cady. of Iowa
City. will conduct the vesper ser-
vices tomorrow afternoon.

The high school will give a re-
ception this evening to the Wat-
erloo team and friends of the
high school. College students
are welcome.

A plan is on foot to organize a
band to play forthe Cornell game.
Practice will be begun at once
and any students who play hand
instruments are rchiested to hand
their names to Lawrence O'Grady.

The campus committee are dis-
pleased with the promiscuous ad-
vertising done on the campus. as
it is not considered advisable that
advertising matter. not concern-
ing college affairs, should be dis-

 

tributed on the Campus.
