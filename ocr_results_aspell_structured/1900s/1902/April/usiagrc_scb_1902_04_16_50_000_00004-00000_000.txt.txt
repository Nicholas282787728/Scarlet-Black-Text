THE WILLETT LECTURES.

Grinneu People to Have Great Privilege.
Series at Six Lectures to be
Given.

TheCliristian Associationsliave
succeeded in securing Prolessor
Herbert L. Willct, of the Univerr
sity of Chicago, tor a course or
six lectures on the Bible, to be
given at the Congregational
Church during the week or May 5
to May to,
not be familiar with Dr. Willet's

To those who may

reputation. a word of comment

may not be out or place. These

lectures have aroused an amount

and degree oi interest quitc extra-
ordinary. They are said by the
most competent judges to present
Bible themes and characters With
a very unusual Vivrdlicss and
power. The writer has heard trnm
very diverse sources the strongest
expressions or admiration and in
terest. They have been given in
Des Moines. and in a number of
places in and around Chicago; and
seem never to have failed in
awakening a new interest in the
themes discussed. Dr, Willett
lectured on the "Prophets," at the
Detroit Christian Endeavor Con-
vention in 1899; and the following
extracts from the “Christian Eri-
dezivor World" will give some
idea or the impression that was
made. “Probably there is not in
America a ﬁner teacher of the
prophetical books than Professor
Herbert L. Willett of the Chicago
University.and the number of En-
deavoiers who took advantage or
such an opportunity was limited
only by the seating capacity of
one of the largest churches in the
city. Enthusiasm fur the Bible.
that's the word. Not hand clap-
ping over it but delving into its
treasures.” Dr. Willett. during
the past winter. supplied the.pu1e

 

pit or the First Congregational
Church at Evanston. while its
pastor, Dr. Loha, was absent on a
visit to the missions otthe Ameri-
can Board, and held that large
congregation with unfailing suc-
cess. In fact every thing that we
can learn indicates that in this
proposed course of lectures a very
unusuztl opportunity is ohered to
the students and to thc people or
Grinnell. Thecoursciscxpensive,
but the Associations have at-
ianged that it shall be given witit
no Charge for admission.
