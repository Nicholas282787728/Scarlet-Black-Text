THE ANNUITY PLAN.

Plan For increasing Endowment Fund,
Givers to Receive interest Dur-
ing Lire.

There are many worthy friends
of Christian Education who desire
to give their property to endow
the Christian college but who
need the income of what they
possess during their life-time.
Moreover, by reason of age or
inﬁrmity or unfamiliarity with the
methods of business, such persons
would be glad to be relieved of
the care at property, provided
they could feel sure that it was in
absolutely sate hands and certain
to yield them or tllose dependent
upon them regular and prompt
returns. The college has a large
experience in making sate and
conservative loans at fair rates of
interest. ltsbusinesstransaclions
involve large sums or money an-
nually. In its ﬁftyrﬁve years or
business it has lost not a dollar of
money invested, though during
the same period half a dozen
serious panics have swept over
the country ruining thousands of
corporations and individuals. Its
investments are made by a comr
mittee of conservative business
men on productive real estate
chieﬂy in Iowa. Its assets are
constantly increasing. Its agree-
ment to pay is as reliable as any»
thing human can be. To such
patrons ot sound learning Iowa
College is prepared to make the
rollowing propositions:

r; Iowa College will accept and
hold the property of such persons
as are mentioned above, in any
amount, invest the same and pay
over annually or semi-annually to
the donor during his or her life
time a fair rate of interest on the
amount given.

2. At the death of the donor,
the princrpal, released froth the
obligation of the annuity, wlll tllen
be placed in the Endowment, the
Scholarship, or the Fellowship
Fund as stipulated by the donor,
and the name of the donor will be
attached to the fund, to be used
by 'the college forever, as design
nated.

The college can anord to accept
the responsibility and transact
the necessary business relating to
such funds, because it is constant-
ly making investments and can

add to its transactions with little
increased cost. Moreover the
life of the oldest individual
short, while the life of the college
is perpetual, and it can well afford
to wait. It can thus seive its
friends while theylive, and reap
its reward, and aitl them to do
their charitable work after they
pass on. This method.ot
mediate convenience to Oul friends
and ultimate aid to the college is
not an untried one. Several con-
selvative persons in business have
sought its advantages and without
suggestions from the college. It
has been uniformly satisfactory to
those who have adopted it.

President Dan F. Bradley, or
Secretary H. H. Robbins, Iowa
College, Grinnell, will be glad to
confer with any who may be plane
ning to use their property in the
manner named above.

FALL FIELD MEET.

For two years various circumr
stances have prevented the hold
ing of the regular lall handicap

meet. This year it is planned to

hold a iull meet in four or ﬁve

weeks and the men are already be
ginning their training tor the

events. The value of this meet

has been more appreciated during
the two years it has not been held.
It is a splendid opportunity forall
who do not play football to do
systematic outdoor work, besides
offering track mcn training that
will wcll supplement the work in
the spring. New men especially
are welcome when many old track
men are on the football squad and
the expeiience of the fall training
and meet will stand them in good
stead.

Grinnell never gets her athletes
ready made. They are developed
here, and every man should be out
doing what he can tor the old
scarlet and black. No one can say
what he is able to do till he has
tried, and a year under Jaclr Watr
son will do wonders tor any man.
For those who do not expect to
do hard work on the track there is
no better way of getting good,
healthy, regular exerctse. which is
not over done. Every new man is
welcome whether he has had track
training or not.

ATHLETIC UNION MATTERS

For years the athletic union
has labored under the burden of
a debl.and this year a determined
effort will be made to pay it, As
all students do not understand the
terms for membership it is well to
say that 'allyone may become a
member by the payment of the
semester dues, si.5o. Those who
do not take an active part in
athletics may become members
with the right to vote. and hold
ofﬁce. on payment or the regular
dues. This is an organization
which the women may join also,
and last year and this quite a
number of loyal girls have joined
the union. Every one in school
is urged to do at least this much
toward lifting the debt. Itevery
studentpaid duesthisyearthedebt
would disappear and this would be
the easiest way at payingit. Good
attendeuce at the football games
here will not only encourage the
team, but will materially aid the
athletic union. Grinnell spirit
must pay this debt as well as win
athletic contests. Members of the
different classes have been ap-
pointed to assist treasurer Rickctts
of the union and it is hoped that
all will respond heartily.
