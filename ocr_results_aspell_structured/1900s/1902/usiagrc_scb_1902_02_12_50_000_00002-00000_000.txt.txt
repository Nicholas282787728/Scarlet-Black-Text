MONG the exchange items

in tlle last number of 7/1:
Cor/Milton, is found the following:

“The editorrinrchiet of the
SCARLET AND BLACK gets three
hours credit per term.”

On just what information the
exchange editor or our esteemed
contemporary based this state-
ment is beyond our knowledge
We recall that a similar assertion
appearedin another college paper
a little over a year ago, and it may
be tllat this has just reached the
exchange editor of The Corny/lino.
Itsucli be the case, we may be
pardoned for suggesting that it is
about as fresh a bit of news as
many other exchange items that
are going the rounds of the college
press. Lest there be any further
misapprehension, wt: would sugv
gest that there is one fatal weakr
ness about T/w Corizllll'alt': exr
changeiit rs not true. The pres
ent editor of SCARLET AND BLACK
does not receive credit for his
work on the paper,7n0l' did any
of his predecessors, If the editor
ot m- arital/inn is endeavoiina
to secure credit for his work, and
wishes to make use of our point
or view in his campaign, he may
possibly discover whar it is by
reading this to the end.

We are opposed to having
Credltglvell for work done on the
college papers, for two reasons:
In the ﬁrst place. from the very
nature oi the work. college credit

paper work. In the second place.
it it were possible to receive
credit, it would not he expedr
ient. Now as to the ﬁrst point,
As we understand it college credit
is given by sclf»respecting institur
lions, only for academic. work,
and that means for work done in
a continued course of study. along
deﬁnite lines, and under the direct
supervision of a competent in-
structor. collegencwspaperwork
does not meet these requirements
The value of such work is not
questioned. The value of football
playing is recognized on all sides.
but we suspect that a proposition
to give college credit tor rootball
playing would not be seriously
entertained for a moment. The
work or the business manager of a
college paper hirnishes him with
some very valuable experience,
but, as yet. we have not heard it

lege llltisicalorganizations receive
excellent training, but Is there
any sound reason why they should
receive credit for it? In short

we fail to see why the editor oi,

the college paper is entitled to
academic credit. any nrore than
its business manager, or the mem-
bers oi the musical organizations,
the literary alld dramatic clubs,
and many other student enters
prises, which are oigreat value,
Now tor the second point. If
it were legitimate to receive credit,
it would not be advisable, for tlle
reason that it the plan were con
sistently carried out, the work
would have to be under faculty
supervision, In our opinion such
a censorship would be very de-
trimental to college journalism.
The irecdom or the college press

ought to be preserved, to some.

extent. at least. The responsibilr
ity for the management of the
paper, both from the literary and
ﬁnancial slandpoiuts, iurnishes
to those in charge the most valuar
blcexperience. This,under faculty
super sion would not rest upon
the students, and the best part of
the training would be lost, The
opinion is often expressed, that
the college paper rs the exponent
of student opinion. Such expres-
sion would not be true, if the in-
dependence ct student manage—
ment were curtailed by a faculty
censorship. In our opinion the
giving of credit for this kind of
work would not be for the best
interests either of the college or
the paper.
