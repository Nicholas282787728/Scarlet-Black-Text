most iin'portant games on the
schedule. Grlnllell ought to win
it and every student off the team
or on it ought to ieel that he is

Every student is closelyinterested

company the team and hclp lorm

In support item the side hues, ore
gaitization counts as much as
elsewhere, and the Grinnell crowd
that goes to Ames should have
leadeis and stick together to give
the team that stlpport in critical
moments that shows them the col»
lege is behind them and support»
ing them, win or lose. It Grinr

ganization and enthusiasm. Yell

BEFORE it is too late or so
late as to cause inconr
venience. the iniercollegialc de
bate should be arranged. lt
this matter is put off. other col-
leges'will have arranged lor this
year's debates and Grinnell will
have to accept what she can get.
Unusual interest was shown in the
debate with Washburn last year
and as far as possible this interest
should he lrept up. The opportune
ities tor success in intercollegiate
debating in the next few years are
good and advantage should be
taken of them. The opportunity
to combine theory with practice

.has been gained and should not be

neglected.
