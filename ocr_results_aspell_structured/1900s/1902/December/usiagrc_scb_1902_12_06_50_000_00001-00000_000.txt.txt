OTBALL S AsoNi
A Year or Dcrcats and Yet Far From Fail-

ureeNext Year's Prospects Bright.

Grinnell's football team last

year was one of tlte best ever settt
out front this institution to do bat-

tle with the representatives of

other schools for gridiron honors.
The team played a wonderfully
strong game and suffered but one
defeat during the entire season,
at Iowa City, and tltat too when
the team was somewhat disorganr
ized from the Simpson game the
week before.

Tothc grumhlcr the record of
this year’s team is not so brilliant
but in spite of defeats tlle Grin-
nell spirit has not waned. Be-
hind the team, victory or defeat.
the student body has stood loyal-
ly and for this reason alone there
is cause forcongratulation. Above
all elselet us chelish the spirit
which rises above mere victory and
which gracertrlly accepts dcteat.
The impression that other schools
have of Grinnell, and which many
football wt'itenlps have expressed,
is that Grinnell never says, die
In spite of the fact that the team
has been disastrously outweigh-
ed a heavy schedulehas been tvell
played. Although some of the
opposing teams looked like giants
when compared to the pygmies
representing the Scarlet and
Black, yet when the games were
over they well could say, “We feel
we've played Grinnell."

When such a determining factor
as lack of weight is considered
combined with the lack of fools
ball experience, which many of
the team suffered at the opening
of the season, it is truly remarlr.
able what a game the team has
played.

On the whole the men have
played a consistent game and with
more experience should play the
usual snappy ball which means
victories, Toole who played cen-
ter during the latter part of the
season, never donned a suit till
this fall and but three of last year's
team played the last few games of
the schedule. Most of the team
had but little real experience un
til coming to Grinnell, The
schedule as played this fall is as

“THESPANISH GYPSY.”

An Interesting Play to be Given by the
Drama Club

Tire members of the Drama
Club are now preparing to present
their Own dtnmatizntion oiGeorge
Eliot's “Spanish Gypsy.” Cone
traryto the custom of amateut
actors lti Iowa College the Drama
Club have undertaken a play of a
deeply serious nature—a play
which is essentially tragic in tone
and atmosphere.

The presentation of this play
means the conquer-ing of many
difﬁculties. The situations are
strange and striking. and were it
not for the student element so
strongly marked in the Club, it
would be too much of a task for
amateurs to perform.

The main charactersin the play
are:

Fedalma, the Spanish Gypsy.
taken by Miss Smith.

Don Silva, the Spanish noble-
man in love with Fedalnla, Miss
I'Iolden.

Zarca, a Gypsy Chietand Fedal-
ma’s father, Paul Trigg.

Juan,the Court Minstrel, Fred
Condit.

Father Isidor, Prior
quisitor, Mr. Richardson.

Sephardo, an Astrologer, Mr.
Carney.

The other characters are:

Lorenzo, Mine Host,
Hutchins.

Blasco, a dealer in plate, Mr.
Clark,

Roldan, A juggler. Mr. Brun-
dage.

Fabio, A little street singer.

Pepita, A Spanish Girl, Helen
Howatt.

Hinda, A GypsyrGirl, Addie
Morrison.

Besides these are the lords.
dames and pages of Don Silva’s
household, Spanish girls and
gypsies. There are in all 42 peo
ple in the caste.

True to George Eliot's peculiar
style the interest of the play
centers ina life of sacriﬁce. In
this case the heroine is an un-
tamed gypsy, who forsakesa love
that is supreme to follow atather
who means to be the ”Savior of
his tribe." Beforethis "grim idol
of his fantasy” he offers up his
