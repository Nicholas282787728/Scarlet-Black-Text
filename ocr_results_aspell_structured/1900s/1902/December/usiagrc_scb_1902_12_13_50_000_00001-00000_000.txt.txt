A Very Sari aciory Numbcrou the Lee-
titre eon ,eTwo Aitists Emel-
tain a Large Audience—Miss
lda Bsiiroy.

Last evening Miss Betifey gave
an intensely interesting reading
irom victor Hugo's nnvei, Les
Miserables. Miss Bertfey is a
poivertul storytellcrandhoids her
audience under complete control.
She makes her hearers laugh at
the street gamin or thrill with
admiration or pity at the nobility
and humiliation oi Jean Valjean.
It is a very human story and Miss
Bentey interprets it so as to give
new mean rig to its heroism and
ilspathos and to make one feel
that he is closer to a noble life.
The readers voice was sweet. but
powerinl enough to reach every
hearer and held every one in the
closest attention trom the be
ginning to the end of the story.

MISS case.

The second part of the piograrn
consisted oi a song lecital by Miss
Harriet A. Case, oi Chicago.
Miss Case s a graduate oi lowa
College with the class oi '97, and
so found many old triendsto give
her a welcome. Grinnell people
have many pleasant memories oi
her singing during her college
days, and her coming ivas anticlr
pated with considerable interest.

Miss Case presents a charming
personality and stage presence,
and while not a singer of the ﬁrst
rank, her intelligent interpretation
oi tlle songs presented, combined
with a voice that at times was
very eitective made a very enjoy-
able program. It must be re-
marked however. that the songs
which she selected were. almost
without exception. of an exceed-
ingly light order. the productions
oi present day composers, and
whiiepleasinginthemselves,thcre
was nothing of a serious order to
give dignity to the program.

Miss Case is apupii ot Mrs.
Anna Groi’f Bryant. who is having
marked success as a voice teacher,
and is producing many good
singers. Miss Case's voice shows
a marked change since she was
last heard here, her upper notes
in particular having broadened or
become more powerriil.

the renewal of debating with Cor-
nell this year, and the fact that
the inter-Collegiate debate will be
held in Grinnell. the interrsociety
debate, wnichis also a preliminary
for choosing the intercollegiate
team. is of more than usual intere
es‘. The Chrestomathians have
wonthe debate iortwo yearsinsuc.
cession. but the contest this yeal
promises to be as close a one as
was ever held, and may go to either
society, The tcams are chosen in
preliminary contests each spring,
and the selected by the
Chrcstos last year were E. F. Den-
istm, C R, Barnard and W. E.
Paul, while the winners of the In
stitute preliminary were G. 0
Arnold, W. A. llarlan and H. L.
James. Denison, Arnold and
Barnard were the intercollegiate
teatn against Washhurn last )ear
and have had considerable debat-
ing experience, James is a iiard
worker and both Harlan and Paul
are showing up well tor new men.
Both teatns have been hard at
work for two months and are there
oughiy prepared tor the debate.
The question chosen is one ot cone
siderable interest and is that of the
Canadian banking system. The
Chrestomathian team supports the
aﬁﬁrmative.

This debate deserves better sup»

port than it has usually received.
the men on the teams work as
hard in preparation as the meni»
bers of any athletic team, and yet
the debates usually receive very
mediocre support. The debate
deserves stipport as a worthy enr
tertainnient. The men have worked
hard and will put up interesting
and instructive talks. Miss Smith‘
has had the members of the team
in hand tortraining in delivery for
some time. No admission fee will
be charged and all friends are wel
come. Among the out of town
judges will be Judge S. F. Prouty
oi Des Moines and H. H. Stipp,
'96. who coached the inter collegi-
ate team last year, and is himself
a poweriiil orator,

itliat those whotake part have been

these contestants an opportunity
to show the most of which they
are capable with so short a time
