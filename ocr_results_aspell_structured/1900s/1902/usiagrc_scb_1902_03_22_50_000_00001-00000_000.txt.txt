THE HOME CONCERT.

Glee club and Orchestra Give the Ann
nual Concert at the ColonialiA
Crowded House Present

As usual tllt: home concert of
the glee club and orcllcstra was
quite satisfactory, In every way
last night's entertainment was

very successiul. According to
ancient custom the audience came
to hear and applaud, anti they
were not disappointed. for every
number was very heartily and
justly encored. From ﬁrst to last
the selections seemed to be just
the ones to please the throng that
ﬁlled the new theatre.

The program began with Macy's
“Rosebud Fair" sung by the glee
club which responded to an encore
and was followed by the arches
tra with Schuberts’ ”Marche Mili-
tairc,” which also rcceivcd wcll
merited applause. Mr, Condit
and the club sang a good old
drinking song, “Brown October
Ale,” after which the orchestra
gave a very pleasing number,
Waltzes from “Die Fledermaus.”
Then came the glee club with
“My Home is Where the Heather
Blooms" and as encore they sang
“TthtoryoftheWonderquTree"
which gave every one a chance to
laugh and especially pleased the
juvenile part of the audience.
This ended the ﬁrst part of the
program. The glee club opened
the second part with a hunting
song, and then one of the most
beautirul numbers or the program
was given by Miss Raw and the
orchestra. This piece was per-
haps appreciated and liked bctter
than any other. After “The Owl
and the‘Pussy Cat” by the club,
came the annual roasts on stu
dents and faculty which were met
with the annual generous and en»
thusiastic ieceptioti. This part
at the program was closed by
Brahnt's "Hungarian Dance" and

to Me Only With Thine

an old song can please. As an
encore was given the chair drill
with new variations. Mr. Thorpe
and the orchestragavc”Bcrceuse”
by Gounod and i-csponded to a
very hearty encore. A march
trorn Herbert's "Fortune Teller"
andthe“AlumniSong," written by

w. B. Cu or, music by Prof,
Olds, ﬁnished the evening's con-
cert. It sonic student or graduc
ate would compose a college song
as popular and beautiful as this.
Grinncll would no longer need to
use the paraphase or Michigan's
oltl song.

So ended another home concert
and the old traditions were kept
up in its quality and its success.
In spite or several disadvantages
the club and orchestra have pres
served their esprit de corps and
seem to be as strong organizac
tions as iornrerly. The School of
Music as well as the rest of the
college seems to be entering a
new period of growth and this will
surely be reﬂected in the interest
taken in the orchestra and the
club. It is earnestly hoped that
as the college grows in numbers
the girls’glee club ma;- be rt ' ,
ed and added to the list of thriv-
ing college organizations.

Financially,also,last night’s cone
cert was all that could be desired.
Every seat in the Colonial was
sold except a tew in the gallery,
and the weather was such as to
permit a full attendance. A great
many alumni and out of town
triends helped to swell the aunt»
bers of the audience. Next week
the trip through southern Iowa will
be begun and more cannot be de-
sired than that this trip niay con-
tinue the scason for the glee club
and orchestra as atispiciously as it
has begun.

THE ALUMNI AND THE LIBRARY

Thetestimony ottcn comesfrom
graduates of the college who are
engaged in school teaching or In
various lines of literary woik that
they very nitich miss the library
privileges or their college days,
During the past month no fewer
than halt a dozen requests have
come to the library from friends
of the college out of town, asking
what material may be folind on
various topics, to be used tor
school or study club purposes. In
some cases it is tor a high school
debate or oration, and lil others
for a teachers meeting or study
club paper or discussion. such
requests are always welcome and
the Librarian is glad to answer
them to the best of his ability.

 

It does not always happen that
the library is able to furnish lit-

sideiation, but it is generally
able to provide a list or pciiod-
tails and book references that
will be usciul and suggestions
where information may be se-
cured. it the inplqbe not too ob-
scure. When it does happen that
the library has material that can
be spared conveniently, it will be
sent out on condition that the
person receiving it shall meet the
expense of transportation and be
responsible furits safe and prompt
return.

Attention of graduates and
tormcr students who are living in
localities where there are no li~
braries is called to the policy of
the college in this direction, with,
the thought that the privileges oi"
the library may be extended and
its usefulness thus increase
