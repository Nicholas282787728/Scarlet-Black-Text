a slight change in fortune. Grin-
nell could not possibly do worse
at state than she did at Anics.
There is not a place, with the ex-
ception ol the broad jump, where
it will be possible for the Scarlet
and Black to score fewer points
than at the triangular. Almost
thc samc ntay be satdot the farms
ers. Thcy may lose the hundred
yards—probably not. They may
lose the halt-mile bicyc|c~prob-
ably they will, When we deduct
these six points rrom her score in
the triangular we must stop,altho
Iowa hopes to win ﬁrst in the dis»
cus throw. The real ﬁght of the
meet next Friday ought to be be»
tween Grrnnell and Alncs for sec-
ond place. Just how much the
presence of Iowa and the smaller
schools will help either one can-
not be torcast. At present the
State University team has a fair
claim on three ﬁrsts, to win the
discus, the high hurdles and the
broad jump. Cornell with Dob-
son should tvin the two bicycle
raccs. Simpson is an unknown
quantity but it is not believed
thatshe will ﬁgure seriously. State
Normal will carry away a few
points. The four schools mention»
ed last ought to divide something
lessthanforty points amongthem-
selves leaving the hundred tor
Drake, Ames and Grinnell.

As to Grinncll's chances for
points it is sate to predict as long
as doing so invoivss less risk.
Bair has an even chance for ﬁrst
in the broad jump, ﬁrst in the high
hurdles and some points in the
sprints. He is more than a likely
winner in the low hurdles, Don
Evans and Mcllrath will hurry
them in the half and the mile,and
the Evans brothers may score in
the quarter. The high jump should
lie between Haines and Graham

 

of Drake with neither having an
advantage over the other, Fisk
has a chance for the hoprstep-and-
jump. his strongest competitor be-
ing Graham while Kng is ltkciy
to take a place in the pole vault.
Grinnell should win second or
third in the rclay. Antes inking
First. our bicycle tncn, Van Evcra
and Wood have a chance for
score and will see that they who
do win places liavc to ride ior
them.

Notwithstanding the last that

may be assured ot plenty oi ox.
citemcnt should they attend. [or
after all it is close events rattler
than closc scores that make meets
interesting. We have an even
