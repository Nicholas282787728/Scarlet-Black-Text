and Grinnell InstituteiA Chresioma-
thian Victory ~They win Debate

and Take First Places.

The Inter-Society debate was
held in the chapel on Monday
evening, December 15, in the
presence of a fair sized and en~
thusiastic audience. The question
for debate was, “Resolved, That
the Canadian Banking system
Should he Substituted tor the
Present System in the United
States." The Chrestomathian So-
ciety. represented by E F. Deni-
son, C, R, Barnard and W. E.
Paul. debated the afﬁrmative; the
Institute Society, represented by
G. 0. Arnold, W. A. Harlan and
H, L. James, debated the nega
tive. The judges of speakers
were: Judge 5. F, Prouty. J. F.
Hardin. D. W. Norris, jr., Rev. S.
R. Robinson, Professor Richards,
Professor Macy and Professor
Johnson; and thejudges of debate
were, H. S. Richards, Professor
Almy and Professor Norris,

The debate was opened for the
afﬁrmative by Mr. Denison, In a
clear and forcible manner he ar-
gued that the Canadian banking
system was elastic, centralized,
well managed, and safe. He
showed that money in Canada
could easily be transferred from
one part of the country to another,
and he maintained that during the
last ten years the Canadians had
lost less than one-thirtieth of one
per cent of their deposits. '

Mr. Arnold opened the debate
for the negative. He maintained
that while the Canadian system as
a whole'Was inelastic. our system
was very BIaSllCi Conditions, he
claimed, were not the same, be
cause in Canada, banking was in a
stage of development, while in
the United States it had passed
the preliminary stage.

The second afﬁrmative speaker
was Mr. Barnard. He argued that
our banking system was inelastic,
that bank notes were circulated
when they were least needed, and
that during the last few years
panics had been avoided by the
use of illegal means on the part
of the Secretary of the Treasury

in the second speech for the
negative Mr. )ames maintained
that the Canadian system was abr

solutely unsafe, that paper money
in Canada was inﬂated. and that
we needed, not the Canadian sys-
tem but an emergency circulation
of bank notes.

In the third speech for the
afﬁrmative, Mr. Paul argued con-
cisely. clearly and logically that
our system was not economical,
that $600,000,000 of money were
lying idle, and that rates of inter
est were very unstable. 0n the
other hand, he claimed that Can
ada had an economical system,
that it had no idle money. and
that it had low and uniform rates
of interest.

The third speech for the nega-
tive was given by Mr. Harlan. He
maintained that the Canadian sys-
tem was a monopoly, that it pre»
vented competition. controlled
legislation, robbed the poor, and
ﬁlled the coffers of a few.

After the direct arguments, the
rebuttals were made by the speak-
ers in the following order: James.
Barnard, Harlan, Paul, Arnold
and Denisonl A committee now
received the votes of the judges.
Within ten minutes Dean Main,
the presiding ofﬁcer, announced
that the decision for the afﬁrma~
tive was unanimous. and that of
the speakers, Mr. Denison was
ﬁrst, Mr. Paul second, Mr. Harlan

third, and Mr. Arnold fourth. or
substitute.

The Chrestomathian Society
has won another grand victory;
this is the third time in four years
that it has carried off the trophy,
No small part of the credit. how-
ever. is due to Miss Glenna Smith
for her training of the Chresto de-
baters, every one of whom showed
that he had been under her eﬂ‘is
cient instruction. ,

ought to have one place to go

love of that Christmas child shall
be impressed upon them to inspire
them for thc best work in their
