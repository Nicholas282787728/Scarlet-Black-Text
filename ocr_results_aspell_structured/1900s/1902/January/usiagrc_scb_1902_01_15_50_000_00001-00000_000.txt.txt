years. Speeches were made by
Watson and some of the old track
men, Lyman, Conger, Don and
Evan Evans, and Managchhase.
The new men were given to un.
derstand that the First year is the
timeto begin training if they ex

tore they graduate, and examples
were cited of some of the best

came only alter years oiof honest

None of them were graduated.
Two of the best point
were lost in Clouch, who is now at
S. U. I.. and Walker, who was dis

that the points lost through them
will be made up by the new men.
There is an abundance of inatmial

JACOB A. Rits.

Lecture by Mr. Riis to he Given in the
Congregational Church, Monday,
January 27th.

When

the lecture course was
dently expected that all but the
ﬁist number would be presented
in the new opera house, but the
present unﬁnished condition of
the building makes it quite prob-

The

bars can be given there.

Jacob A. Riis and will be given in
tlic Congregational chuich.

Mr. Riis is probably one of the
mostividelyknown nicninAmerica
today, and it is remarkable when
one considers that he is, to use his
own words, "a reporter, a police

reporter.’ But that he is far more

than an ordinary reporter is very

etident to those who read his

books, or, better still, attend his
lectures. He willgive his audience
in this city his lecture on "The
Battle With the Slum." illustrated
with photographs talten by Mn
Riis himself in the tcncmcnts of
New York City by day and night
in his capacity as police reporier
for the city newspapers. His
labors have by no means been con~
Fined to his profession for he has
served as secretary of the Small
l’arlts committee, as a member of
the committee on Vagrancy, and
is a most energetic agitator for
tcncmeiitliouse ieiorm. President
Roosevelt called him "the most
useful citizen in New Yolk.” He
has also achieved the reputation
of being the aiitlioi of most eiiterr
taining books on the matters. he is
so tamiiiar with and has amply
demonstrated that he is a man
with something to say and knows
very well how to say it.

He is a magnetic speaker, hill
of wit. and is El diamatic as well
as accurate portrayer of the
{acts with which he deals. l—lis
enthusiasm is contagious and his
talk is moslintcrestiug. The views
with which his lecttiies are llliiSr
trated are most impressive. He
is eloquent because as he hiniseli

 

suggestshe speaks what he knows.
