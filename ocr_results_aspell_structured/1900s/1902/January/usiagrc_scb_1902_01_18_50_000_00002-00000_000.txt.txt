N Mr.Van Horn's informal talk
before the studentsThursday
evening. a statement was made as
to the membership ot the Young
Men’s and Young Women's Chris
tian Associations here in Grintiell.
It was stated that there are ‘trot-n
seventy-ﬁve to a’ hundred members
in thetwo associations. This was
not given as an expression trorn
Mr. Van Horn, but asone coming
from a Grinnell studentra fact
which justtﬁes us all the more in
reterrtng to it at this time. It is
such a ﬂagrant misrepresentation,
that it would be unworthy of lure
ther consideration. were it not for
the fact that great injury is being
done the college by the circulation
of similar statements which are
based more on ﬁction than on fact.
It could only have been made by
one who is tvoeiully ignorant of
the facts, or who willfully misrepr
resented them. There are at pres:
em a hundre d and thirtyeﬁve
names on the membership roll ot
the Y.\N.C.,A while the names of
eighty men are to be found in the
secretary's book at the Y. M. Q A.
A membership of two hundred and
ﬁfteen out of a possible tour hun»
dred is a very different statement
from the one quoted by Mr, Van
Horn, lt m' 'be true. as Mr. Van
Horn quoted irorn a brother min-
ister, that there is not much relig-
ion in Iowa College, but we have
a pretty well developed feeling
that what little religion is here
should nol be discounted quite so
largely as was done by Mr. Van
Horn's Whether or
‘not there is as much religion in
Iowa College Ct> in other denom-
inational schools, we do not know,
but one thing we do know, and

that is that there is in the college
vastly more ol the “real, genuine
religion." which Mr. Van Horn
spoke of. than is revealed by any
organized eﬂort which may exist.
Especially is it true in ourcollege
that the activity along religious
lines cannot be judged by the nu»
merical strength of the Christian
Associations.

$1413 ettort to secure a per:
manently endowed book
fund for the library should receive
the support of all the students.
That the library is not receiving
the support that it should is evid-
ent to all tvho are familiar with
the constantly increasing demands
that are made upon it. Its needs
are great, and the opportunity to
supply these needs. in a limited
way, should not be neglected by
those who for the tithe being, are
most directly concerned. We
urge it upon the students to give
this matter their serious thought,
and to contribute what they can
towards this endowment fund.
It has become the custom (or
classes to establish class mentor
ials. TllH isan excellent oppor
tunity for that purpose, and we
commend it to the attention of the
classes
