Two HARD GAMES COMING

Results in recent games seem
to indicate that Grinnell Wlll have
no easy games this yertr. On
October I4. Simpson, in a hard

the victory over AIIICS was no

cnnhrlenre on the part of the
Stitte College, Cornell must have
had a strong team with which to
surprise her opponents and Grins

hardest game that has ever been
played willi that college.

 

THE MINNESOTAJOWA GAME.

Not having a game nt her own
Sa iirtlty, the attention otall Grin-
nell was riveted oti Iowa City
where the learns of Minnesota and
Iowa were pitted against each
other. It was the thirtl earliest
between the two schools, aitd lor
the third time the Gopher aggro
gallon won a decisive victory ovcr
its liawkeye rivals.

Early in the nineties the Iowa
team journeyed to Minneapolis
tor the ﬁrst time, only to meet a
disastrous defeat. After this for
many years no games were ar
ranged between the two schools.
and athletic relations tvere sus»
pended as far as football was con-
cerned. Matters stood thus when
in the tall of tgoo both schools for
the ﬁrst time in their history pro-
ducecl teams of western champion»
ship term, and a general desire
arose for them to meet on the
gridiron. Accordingly the game
of last year was arranged, results
ing in 316 0 score for Minnesota,
Saturday history repeated itself,
and the Gophers went back to
their holes in the north with their
pockets lined with a score at 34
to Iowa‘s o.

The game had been pretty
generally concededto Minnesota,
only the size of the score being
a matter of speculation. The
Iowans uere outweighed and out-
played, though they seemed to be
in better physical condition than
their opponents. It will be inter»
esting to note what will take place
when our light team goes against
the Minnesota giants next Salurr
