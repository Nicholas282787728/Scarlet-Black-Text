Grinncll, Saturday, January 25, rpm
RTICLE IV of the constitu»
lion of the Athletic Union
states the qualiﬁcations for men‘h
bership In the Union in the follow-
ing word "Any person connect-
ed with any department of the col-
lege is eligible to membership.”
The meaning ot thrs is so at vari-
ance with the interpretation “hich
seems to be put upon it by the
great majority of the students that
we wish to call the attention of the
students to what is actually stated
in this part of the constitution.
It does not state, as is believed by
many students, that membership
in the Union is conﬁned to those
who are taking part ill college ath-
letics The constitution says that
"Axr person connected with .\.\'\‘
department or the college is cllgi-
ble to membershipﬂea statement
that surely is broad enough in its
meaning tn include all who want
to join. It is true that, as the
Union now is, the membership
consists almost exclusively of the
college athletes, but the important
thing to bear in mind is the fact
that the Union as it now is, is not
what it should be, and not what it
might be it the students of the
whole college would rally to its
support, and add their names to
the roll of members. The limit
upon the membcrship,as provided
in the constitution, will be reached
when the number of members in
the Union is equal to the number
otstudentsenrollcd in the College.
Academy and School of Music,
plus the number of members on
the [acuity and their assistants.
The point to be remembered is
that the Union is open to all who
are connected with the college7
men and women alike. It is the
boast of Cornell and the Agricult-
ural College,that a number of girls

There is no conceivable reason
why Gl‘lnncll should not be equal-
ly fortunate. We believe that the
situation here is largely due to a
misunderstanding as to the re
quirements of the Union, and we
are convinced that great success
will attend the efforts of the Ath»
letle Union oPﬁcials in a systematic
canvass for members.

QUINQUENNIAL REGISTER.

Although Five years has passed
since the Qtlinquennial Register
or 1897, was published, there will
be 'no publication at that namc
gotten out this year. Such has
been the decision of the authori-
ties. who are sadly handicapped
by a lacl: of funds. Considerable
work has been done in prepara—
tion [or the new Quinquennlal,
before it was ﬁnally decided to
give up its publication for the
present. It is the hope of many
that the matter may be |C-CDﬂSld'
el-ed, and the work be permitted
to go on.
JUDGES SUBMITTED TO WASH-
