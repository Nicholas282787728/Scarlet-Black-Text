PLANS FOR INSTRUCTION iN
WORKS OF AR‘L

A plan has been undertaken by
some triends ot the college. to
hang in the chapel from time to
time reproductions ot a tew oi
the great masterpieces of Art.
Each picture will remain long
enough to become tliolotlghly
familiar to tile students. It is
hoped that a hrlet account may
be given in SCXRLET Axn BLACK
of these pictures as they succeed
each other so that thcobselratlon
or them may be somewhat more
discriminating than ltwould other-
wise be. By this means a most
valuable acquaintance he
gained with photographs oi some
of the worlds great pictures anti
statues

This kiiohiicdg will not he very
systcmdtlg it is ti c, but it rs a
step in the direction ol enriching
our college opportunities lil rt rc-
specr that has been too much
neglected. '

The pictures that have just been
placed on the chapel walls are
photographs of the head and
shoulders of two marble statues,
one of a gleat Greek masterpiece,
'the Hermes of I’raxitelts, the
other of a great modern \\‘0lh', the
David of Michael Angelo.

The Hermes dates from the
ﬁrst half at the fourth century B.
'C. It is tlle only complete work
we have from the hand of Praxiie-
125 and is incomparable in the
perlection ot execution. Tire
high pl'ace it holds in the ad
miration of the modern world is a
tribute to the greatness of
the period from which it springs,
since many lost works by Praxiter
les and his contemporaries were
~regarded by those who knew them

The head embodiesn very noble

ﬁes the contrast between the an-
