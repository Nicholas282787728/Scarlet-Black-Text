that they have hcen gratiﬁed by

not always lending to victnrv.
may turn defeats into virtual
victories by the nerve aiid dogged

are sustained.

As means of iiicrensiiig the in-

A WORD FROMJACK WATSON.

Having been rtquesled by SCAR-
LET nxl) BLACK to write a few lines
regardlng our loolball team which
has just closed such a successlul
senson,1am pleased and ltlgllly
gratiﬁed ll.) be liblc to make the
statement that (luring my experi-
ence in athletics I have never
trained a man nor team harboring
a spirit more loyal, brave and true
than our football team of tool.

Their hellltvlor on the gridiron
was always that becoming Iowa
College students. whether at home
or out of town. My orders in re»
gard to training were at all times
implICllly obeyed.

Sometimes the walk aside from
football was arduous. but it was at
all times done with that spirit so
characteristic of Grinnell athletes,
the captain always leading the way
and setting an example which will
never fade from the minds of all
connected with this vear's team.

in this connection something
mtghl be said concerning the op-
norluniliesoffered liereinGrinnell
forsecurinz good, wholesome food
for the athletes The advantage
and beneﬁt to the men afforded by
a wellsconducled trainina table
are simplv inestimable. and it islo
he hoped that the institution will
he able to provide so necessarv a
feature of proper and thorough
training in the near future.
