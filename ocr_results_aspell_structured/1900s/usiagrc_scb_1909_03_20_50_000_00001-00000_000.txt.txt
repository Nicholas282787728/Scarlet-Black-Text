the “honorable negative gentlemen"

irom Drnke University by ti decision
or two to one, alter a closely ionght
and interesting debate. The audience
was perhaps the largest which has wit-
nessed a debate or the Triangular
League in Gl'illnell and one which was
equally loyal in its support oi the home
team, and courteous in its treatment
of the blue and rvliite representative .

This makes two debates won by each
institution in the tour years ot the

In rebuttal Drake nrﬁrnied that this

While Protessor Norris has not the

yet he has made it a nruseuni that
takes rank among the best or the

class is represented and only the very
large museums can show a better so-
lection oi specimens. Altogether it is
very instructive and very interesting
and well worth taking time to examine

Saturdays and to the students every
