Last Wednesday evening, at. the
Congregational church, Grinnell was
given che privilege of llearingalecture
on “The Rise and Development or the
Social Settlement Idea,” by one who
is probably America’s greatest expoA
nent of this particular branch of social
reform, Miss Jane Addams, of Hull
House, Chicago, and the Well-ﬁlled
seats gave evidence or the fact that
Miss Addams and her work do not
need advertising, and that the citi-
zens and students of Grinnell appreci-
ated their opportunity. Miss Addalns’
duties are yearly growing heavier. so
that it will probably be butaslioro
time before she retires from the plat-

form altogether.

She was introduced brieﬂy by Dr.
Steiner, Who considers her one of
America’s greatest women. Alter

movement in Whitechapel, London,

JUNIOReFREsHMEN PARTY.

Members ohgog GivcnaMinstrelSi-low by
Their Upper Class Ererhr:n,~A
Successful Affair.

Tlle Freshman class learned lustsm
urdayeve what people mean when
they say that 1907 has a reputation
iorsuooessiul entertainments. Instead
of cndeavoriug to have each or 250 in-
divldnals entertain himsell there was
provided something which each could
enjoy separately but which gave to
the whole assembly a feeling ofgood
iellowship and unity. The gymnasi-
um was turned into a theatre, and ior
an hour and uhali music, jokes and
specialties kept the audience in good
humor.

A stage had been erected in the
north end or the room, while the rest
oftlleliall was decorated in the con-
volitional manner with settees, palms,
bunting, etc. An 5:30 an overture ar-
ranged from one old plantation melol
dies together with some rag-time sur—
rounded uie beginning ortlle performr
anoe and the parting of the curtains
diseloseda lninstrel ring of iourreen
people, the two on each end being in
regular end-man costumes of burnt
com and outlandish clothes. From
then and more were continual “do-
lugsH until a ﬁnale composed of songs
and yells and the two classes closed
the program at 10 o’clock.

The managers were fortunate in the
choice of music and musicians, the
cardinal quartette, in combiuacion and
in solo worr- pleasing the audience rs.
pooinlly. The singing or Wesllilhe
and Lyman was received wiui the
usual enLllnsiiism, while the runny
”Colored Baptism" as sung by Peck
madeu great hit. The choruses by
the entire company here also well
worked out, some unusual raiiatlons
and endings adding to their success.
The program as a whole wasasrol-
lous:

Overcureeencire Company, Solo——
Westmke, SoloiLyman, Quartettei
Lyman, Peck, Westlzllic, Jauuu, Read-
ing —Cocln-un, Violin soloiPeckﬁead-
ing—Iiew, Soloelaqua, Mandolin and
Guitar trio, Solo—McCormick, Soloi
Peck, Vcntliloqulsm—G. D. Smith,
Finale.

Between each number che end man
jokes and specialties were introduced,
Westlake and Hails making the greac
esbhitin the line. Each man hada
name mallnlactured fortllerlle occa-
sion and wllen Smith as Proi. Penuchi

came on ln his conversation \viLh
“Cupid" he won much applause. The
performance as a whole and m dccnil
was highly successiul and when af-
Lerwaids ihe Company had been ﬂamt-
ily served with ice cream, cake and
collee they felt than an evening had
been spenbin a manner with enjoy-
able and socially proﬁtable to all con-
cerned. The committee to whose
work much of the success or one iiﬂair
is due, was composed oi Ethel Towne,
Lora Carney, Sue Hartman, Jean
Gait, Harry Harris, Clayton Haas,
Fay Baylor and Robb. Clack.
