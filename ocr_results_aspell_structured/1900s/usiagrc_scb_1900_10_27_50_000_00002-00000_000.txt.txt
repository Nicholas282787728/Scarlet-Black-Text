‘ SE s appropriate at this
me to say a word or two in re
gard to the ”honor system” which
is in vogue in Iowa College. Full
information on this matter is to be
found in the Handbooks, and no
would urge the students, old as
well as new, to study the matter
over. The object of this system is
to relieve the members of the face
ulty from the disagreeable task ol
keeping a constant walcli upon thc
students. The burden ot main-
taining a standard of honor in the
class-room work rests rrpon the
students and upon them alone.
The system has been adopted by
the student body and it it does
not accomplish its aim,namely: to
prevent dishonest work, the stur
dent body is to blame; upon tirenr
rests the responsibility. There
can be no dotibt that the “honor
system” does prevent much dis—
honesty. Variousinstrtutions have
adopted it and it has proved el~
iectrve in its workings. It is cerr
tainly an improvement upon the
old system where the honest stu-
dent is to a gleat extent watched,
as well as his tellorvstudent, who
lack; this acquirement, and the
feeling which this constant watch
creates upon him is anything but
agreeable. Now that we have
taken the responsibility from the
hands of the faculty, it behooves
us as students to do justice to the
responsibility that rests trporr us.

Board of Athletic Control.

The Alumni Board of Athletic
Control has been in operation
since the opening or the tall term,
and bids falr to be as successlul
and efﬁcacious as was the purpose
and intent of its promoters. All
athletic affairs both as to policy
and ﬁnance come under the im-
mediate supervision of the Board
ot Control. No radical change in
athletic relations with other
schools an be made without the
sanction of the Board. No ﬁnanr
cial expenditure can be incurred
without at least the countersign
of the Chairman of the Board.
This system insures a continuity
ot policy and an economy in h-
nance, which the hitherto discon-
nected departments and the year-
ly change or personale in the
managements have prevented.
The system inaugurates itself unr
der a strong board oi individuals.
Dr. P. E. Somers is a resident
alumnus, well known to students,
town people and alumni allltc, a
warm supporter of athletics and a
man of business tact and ability.
Hers well qualiﬁed for his posir
tion as Chairman of the Board.
Mr. Fred Spnulding is the other
resident number of the Board, al-
so well known as awarm (rlond of
Grinncll athletics and as a suc-
cessful business manager. Mr.
Chas. Rawsnn. of Des Moincs,
is the nonrl'c dent member. Past
services to his college have cx-
cited only thl: utmost conﬁdence
in his abilitity and loyalty, and
need no comment. Proi. Davis,
