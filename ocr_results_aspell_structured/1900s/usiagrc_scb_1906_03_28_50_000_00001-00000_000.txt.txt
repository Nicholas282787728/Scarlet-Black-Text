NOTICE.

The LITTLE MOTHER"

Mrs. noon. Holds Close Arrenrion of
Large 'Audiencc While Speaking
or Her Work.

Last Saturday evening the lecture
course season was closed by Mrs.
Maud Ballington Booth,wllo told other
work in the pii ns orourcountry and
how she had tried to help the nation’s
convictsbothin prison and aiter re-
leased

Arter telling how she regarded the
matter of kee ping the country
in touch with the work and the great
opportunities it oliers as important as
the actual prosecution of the work in
giving help and hope to the convicts,
she said there wereowo reasons which
led her to take up the work. The ﬁrst
was the belief that God had put in
some bit oigold which would be worth
the mining, and the second was the
beliei in human natureethat there is
in everyone a sperlroniumunity which
will respond to the proper inﬂuence,
and. surely there must be few hearts
so hardened that they would not re.
spend to such it character and person-

- looth‘s. ~

The system pursued in the work or
keeping the prisoners has been one of
individual 'aid. Although there has
beenaleague provided which is the
basisor the Work it is not the intene
tion to regard rhe convicts merely as
aclass but as 'ngle persons each or
which is as precious and deserving or
attention as any other.7llie “ninety
and nine” idea over again. As in as
possible Mrs. Booth knows the man
personally and the size or her col-res
pondence proves the appreciation with
which her elicits are received. Religir
olis services are held in the prison
chapels at which Mrs. Booth or her
husband presides, real ting the iliir
pcrrance or the critical instant when
convicts are released from prison the

ons she works in, ior she has eased the
burdens of the keepers by her immense
inﬂuence on the convicts. Oil‘s
cial Statistics Show that only rive per
cent of the prisoners are convicted a
second time. This woman ’5 work is
magniﬁcent,

As a speaker she is forceful, attract»
ire and clear. She is the most earnest
speaker who has appeared on our plat-
form (or years. When her full, rich
voice tells of their Words of love her
audience gives her the closest atterr
tion and every word is felt as coming
from her heart. Although herorator-
ical ability may at ﬁrst impression
strike one as elocutionary and Lheartr
rical. as soon as her real subject is
reached, and she actually begins to
talk, all qualities but the clearness
and sincerity or her speech disappear.
She is truly a wonderful womanlof im-

mense ability and untiring ellort.

SEAT SALE ENORMOUS.

The ”East Club in me Wesr”is Assured
Ola Large Audience ar the
Annual Concerl.

The seating capacity of the Colon-
ial bids {air to be overtaxed at the
twelfth annual concert oi the Iowa.
College Glee Club. The seat sale oc-
curred on Saturday last and tickets
went like hot cakes. All the seats on
the main near and balcony are taken
and there are only a. few left in the
gallery. In the meantime, out of
town orders are rapidly coming in
and it begins to look as though even
standing room would be at aprein-
ium. The club always has had a.
large audience but it seems as though
this year’s attendance will break all
records. It is to be regretted that
Grinnellhas nota suitable auditorium
with a larger seating capacity. Many
town people Will undoubtedly be kept
away on account of the lack of seats
The program will begin promptly at
eight and it behooves the people who
are usually late to be on time at this
silent The doors will be 'closed and
will only be opened between numbers.
At the close of the program, a recap
tion will be given in honor of the G
at the Women’s gymnasium.
formal invitations have been issu
but the public is cordially invited to

be present.
