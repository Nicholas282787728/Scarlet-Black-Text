Grinnell Took t-Ier Medicine,
Touchdown Almost Scored but Iowa
Invincible, ‘
Over 1000 people saw Grinnell
make her pluck‘y ﬁght against
. Iowa last Saturday afternoon and
there is not one of the thousand
who says there is disgrace in the
deieat received. Not once were
the hundred or more rooters acA
companying the team forced to
apologize for the play ot their

men:
As a preliminary to the big

game, Coe and the Iowa Scrubs
battled for supremacy. coe had
the best of the ﬁerce game and
won by a place kick in the ﬁrst
half, the Score standing 5 to 0 at
the end of the game. Then
Grinnell appeared; followed a
few momets later by Iowa. Both
teams were vociferously cheered
by the rooters, the Iowa rooters
being particularly charitable to-
ward Grinnell. Iowa won the
toss and chose the north goal and
at 3:45 Clarke kicked off to Iowa’s
Io yd. line, Iowa started in with
her snappy play by returning the
ball 1; yards. Then with the
close tackle formation which
made such havoc with Michigan
she plunged through the light
Scarlet and Black line for gains
netting from 5 to 20 yards, and in
less than 3 minutes of play Edson
went over for a touchdown, Wars
ner kicking goal.

The next touchdown came more
slowly. Shortly after tlle kick-
ofl Williams fumbled and the
hall was secured by the nimble
Welker. Lyman made 10 yards
around Iowa’s right end but on
the next down Evans was tackled
for a loss and Clarke punted 35
yards. Fiske stopped Morton
alter a 35 yard run and soon alter
Iowa made her second touchdown.
Iowa’s whirlwind rush now
more ctlcetually stopped by Grin~

was

 

nell and gains of 23nd 3 yards
were the best she could average.
So tar.‘close end runs and sending
ends, tackles and halves just out-
side of tackle had been Iowa’s
only play. When she tried the
old guards back both lines were
piled high and Iowa made no
gain. Grinnell had seen the
guards back before. But Iowa’s
march was irresistible. Touche
down after touchdown followed in
monotonous regularity, Grinnell
ﬁghting every inch of the way
and at the end of the half Iowa
had rolled up 40 to Grinnell's 0.
Iowa made several fumbles in the
ﬁrst half and three times a Grin-
nell man was on the ball but
Clarke was always forced to punt
after the second down. Grinnell
played better ball as the game
progressed and though on many
downs Iowa made no gain. she
never failed to make the required
distance in the three downs.
Guards back was used with better
results intlre latter part of the
ﬁrst half but was not nearly so ef-
fective as Iowa's tackle play.
During this halt Warner made a
place kick from the r; yard line,

In the second half. as is her
usual custom, Iowa ceased her
heavy line smashes and began to
run the ends. She played more
loosely but Grinnell put rip as
desperate a defense as ever. As
the half was drawing to a close
Clarke kicked off to Iowa’s 45
yard line. Morton made a for
rvard pass and Grinnell was given
the ball on Iowa's 9 yard line.
Grinnell lined up for a place kick
but Iowa was overranxious and
was declared offside and Grins
ncll was put on Iowa’s 4% yard
line. Clarke made 2% thlough
the line but on the next trial
failed to gain. Clarke was again
given the ball. Grinnell’s united
effort pushed him to the goal line
but Iowa's superior weight imme-
diately pushed him back and the
ball was down within Io in, of the
coveted goal,and Iowa's goal line
wassaved once more, Then pan.
dcrnonirrm broke loose among the
Iowa routers as the ball was cnrr
rictl back out of danger. A few
moments latcl' Clark kicked to
Iowa's goal line and Williams can
rictl the ball over and touched it
down, scoring a saiety for Grin-

nell instead of a touchback for
Iowa as he supposed, Shortly
after time was called, with'the
ball on Iowa's 45 yard line. Final
score, 63 to 2.

The entire game was remark-
ably clean and free from touling.
Iowa played magniﬁcently and
Grinnell, though defeated, only
covered herself with honor.
Iowa’s backs frequently fumbled
Clarke’s long, low punts but never
failed to run them back from Io
to even 30 or 35 yards. Edson
and Williams were the star ground
gainers for Iowa.

Manager Mccuteheon says
Grinnell is the second team to
get within Iowa’s 20 yard line this
season.

Lecture Course Announcements.

The Y. M. C. A. lecture course
announcements which were given
otrt Saturday are deserving of
great appreciation on the part at
students and townspeople who are
interested in having men of ability
and prominence visit our college.
The committee are to be congrat-
ulated upon preparing an an
nouncement which combines neatr
ness and fullness of information
so successfully as this one does.
The scarlet and black cover, the
ﬁne illustrations, and the neat ar-
rangements of the different parts
make it even superior to the ana
nollnccrnent of last year. Until
that time the lecture course com»
inittee hat] depended entirely up
on the special announcements sent
out by the different lecture bu-
renus. But with the action of last
year’s committee there was adopts
ed a new plan which was not only
an improvement upon the old
method, bllt which prorrrises to her
come a permanent one.
