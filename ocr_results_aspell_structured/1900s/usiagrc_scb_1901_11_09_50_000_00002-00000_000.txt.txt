Grinnell, Saturday, November 9, [gal
@biturial
®NE fact is evrdent from yes-
terday's gameia tact which
is more signiﬁcant than the victory
itself. The Grinnell spirlt is not
dead. We are forced to tltis most
agreeable conclusion by the gen»
uine interest that was taken in the
Simpson game and by the sponr
taneous and hearty support given
the team at that time. A feeling
has been growing in the minds ol
many students and alumni that
the old co-operative spirit in
athletic affairs is dying out. We
are glad to state our conviction
that tllis feeling is without any
real foundation, and that Richard
is himselt again.

without connection with the col~

and discourteous treatment of
visitors we have ever witnessed
on college grounds, We are glad
to note that the sentiment ot the
student hotly is almost wholly
condemnatory to the act. Many
of the students denounce it in the

In the condemnation which the
students of Antes feel with regard

pleased to assure our trrends of
the State College, that Grinnell
attaches no blame to
them for this discourtesy. Our

had received, and with nothing
