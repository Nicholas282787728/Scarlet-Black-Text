HUMEOLDT sociETY MEETING.

Proiessor Smith Discusses the Place oi
Music in the History 0( Cul'ruie.

The HumboltSooiety met The even-
ing and listened to a consideration or
music as a part oi culture as given by
Professor Smith.

The paper began with plea ior the
cultural study or llistoryitlie study
of the evolution or the spiritual
nature or man. Then the music oi
ancient oriental nations was consider-
ed and their contributions to the de-
velopment oi the art brieliy noted. or
these nations modern music is chieﬂy
indebted to the Greeks for its tonal
system and to the israeiitesior spiritr
uni inspiration. The eiiect of the
Christian religion upon the spiritual
development oi man and the expres-
sion oi this spiritual derelopureut in
the art oithe Cirr-.st.an was ernpira
sized. Tire nature oi music was then
hrieily dclined, as compared with the
otherarlsaud the olarrn made that
being the most seiiconsisient as well
as the m -t intangible oi the arts.

STRING QUARTETTE RECITAL.

Di. Heir and ML Heighten Help
Produce D:Fﬁcu1i Program ol
Chamber Music.

Tire most pretentious program yet
attempted by the string quartette was
given at the chapel last evening and
its excellence was slillicleub justifica-
lan for the sterlah‘, ambitious afl-
tempt. Tire quarteito had the shrimp
est personel which it has yet present-
ed, bei ng composed oi Dr. Arthur iieir,
ﬁrst; violin: Dudley Smith, second
violin; David Peck, viola; Wendell
Heighton, 'rrioloncello. Their work,
while at times showing alittie ragged-
uess which betrayed lack of much
practice together. was {or the most
part or a high order. The faults were
all Ola more or less superﬁcial chair
actor while the interpretation and
loading or the score was always a
worthy one.

The program consisted ofa. Rublne
stein quartette, one oi the most beau-
tiiul string compositions ever heard
here, an andahte movement by Holl~
man [or ’cello alone and a Quintana
for strings and piano by Schumann.

Mr. Heighten, whom we have some
times suspected or not getting out of
his instrument all that was possible
never appeared to such good advan-
{age as in his 'cBllD solo and was com»
pelletl to respond to an Encore,

The piano part oi the Schumann

and accuracy. Mrs Niemarlr has a
sure, r; m touch which is almost may
culrnein rs power and p is cleanly.
The strings supnlre an admirable
baclr mound ior the piano and the
whole client was altogether pleasing
