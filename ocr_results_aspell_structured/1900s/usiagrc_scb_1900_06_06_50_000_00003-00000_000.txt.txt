Chrestomathiani

The closing meeting oi the year '

held last Saturday night, was one
of unusual interest. A great nrany
oi our statesmen and others have

asked themselves during the past,

year, Does the constitution oi the
United States extend Of itselfover
newly acquired territories? This
important and difﬁcult question
was discussed by seven aspiring
Chl‘estomathians in a manner
highly creditable to their society.
and instructive to those who lis-
tened, It was a contest {or the
purpose oi selecting a debating
team to represent the society in
the ﬁnal preliminary to the inter-
collegiate debate, It was not
properly a debate, but a discus-
sion. Any member of the society
who chose to enter the race. was
given ten minutes to talk on either
side oi the question The judges
were Prof, Green, Prof. Macy,
Prof. Wyckoff, Mr. C. E. Alley,
Mr. Fuller, Mr, McMillan, Mr.

Grier, Mr. Hamlin and Mr. R. L.
Parker.

The evening was opened by a
well-rendered piano solo by Miss
Clara Thompson. Duringthe cons
test the society was also favored
with a piano solo by Mr. Kendall.
The debaters were J. A. McKee,
S. H. Crosby, H. E. Jones, H. S.
Dickinson, E. F. Denison, W. P.
Barr and D. G. McCartyi There
was not a poor speech in the con-
test, and a number of them gave
evidence oi much study and clear,
careiul thought, While the result
oi the contest was being ﬁgured
up, the society was iavored with
short speeches by several of the
judges,

The result of the decision was
as follows; Mr. Denison, ﬁrst

. place; Mr. Dickinson,second; Mr,
Crosby, third; Mr. Jones, substir
tute.

The year of society work just
closed, although far from what we
could desire, has been highly sat»
isfactory for a number of reasons.
The society has not been espec-
ially large, but there has been
manifest the traditional Chresto
spirit Of earnest, digniﬁed work,
and the determination to “keep
right on" that is sureto win. Never
for years has there been such an
interest in debatin‘g as at present.
Besides winning the annual Chres-
to—lnstitute debate, the society
won an honorable record in den
bate with the Philomathian socier
ty of the State University. Cer-
tainly the outlook for enthusiastic
successful work next year is en-
couragi‘ng.
