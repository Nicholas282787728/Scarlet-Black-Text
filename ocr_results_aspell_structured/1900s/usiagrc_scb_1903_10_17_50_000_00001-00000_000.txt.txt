THE WEEK'S DEVELOPMENTS.

Works at the Western World in Four
balliMinncsot: in the Front Rank.

The developments in western
football the past week have been
decidedly interesting. Of the
leaders, Minnesota seems to have
taken the greatest S‘rldes in ad
Vance, her overwhelming defeat
of Ames' veteran team indicating
that the Gophers are to be top
notchers this season. Michigan
is repeating last year's torm, and
Wisconsin, while developing more
slowly, is doing rcreditably, Al
Chicago all is in readiness for the
Northwestern game today and
comparative scoreswould indicate
an easy victory for Stagg's men.
Within the state theie have been
several surprises. Iowa literally
ran away With the heavier Drake
aggregation, Ames failed to hold
Minnesota to a moderate score.
and Grinnell defeated Missouri.

As a contesr between two ace
knowledgcd leaders in state looks
ball. the Di’alcerlowa game was
especially noteworthy. The re
sult conclusively demonstrated
Iowa's superior‘ team work, but
it should not be inferred that
Drakeis weak. Tllere is wonder
fut material at the Christian Unis
versity this fall. and when once it
doesround into form, there should
be no stronger team in the state.

Of the other schools. Simpson
and Cornell show to the best ad-
vantage. Simpson has played
none but minor games as yet, but
the scores indicate a fast team
Cornell has held both Iowa and
Chicago to low scores and should
be a leader. Just now several
men are out of the game because
of injuries but by the time of the
Grinnell contest our opponents
will be in the pink of condition
and it should be a battle royal.

At home there is great reason
tor encouragement. Loating has
ceased and the. plays go taster

Eighty-seven New Members Voted

Thursday evening in the chapel
occlltred the yearly Recognition
Service of the Y. W, C. A., when
the new members were received
into the Association. After song
and prayer‘the impressive respons
sivc service was read which recog
nized the membership of the new
comers, The Bible lesson was
followed by a circle of prayer, and
after the leader’s address, the
President, Miss Uhl, welcomed
the new members in the name of
theAssociation. Famphletswere
distributed outlining the policies
of the various committees, thus
taniiliarizing the new members
with the organization and machin-
ery of the Association. The
meeting was led by Mary Ray-
mond, chairman of the Member-
ship Committee. The work oi
this committee has been unusual-
ly successful this fall as the list of
eighty-seven new members swells
the roll to two hundred and ﬁt-
teen. larger by ﬁfteen than the
number set in the policy. With
this encouraging start. the Associ-
ation may look tor large results
in the work this year.

AN EXCELLENT CHAPEL TALK.

The chapel was crowded Friday
morning to hear the addiess of
Reverend Alvah L. Frisbie. trus-
tee of town College, and to say
that a good ta'k was given is
putting it mildly. Dr. Frisbic is
not a stranger to Grinnell stu-
dents, and the fact that he is
.iot can be readily accounted for
by all those who had the pleasure
of listening to his address. He
chose for his subject, “College
Work and Life as a School of
Character.”

He spoke on the various phases
of character and the relation that
college lite bears to its develop
ment and formation. Of the many
things that build' character. he
said, discipline, regularity in work,
cultivation of ﬁrmness are {me
most. llabitgiveschnracterﬁrin-
ness and due proportion, and
faithfulness to student ideals will
build a robustness of character,
The hero days are no\v,and the

greatest offering to your country
and your supreme attainment
should he chzilrtctcr.

Notices as tothe time and place
of Mr. Mitchell‘s fencing classes
are posted in the Iadies‘ gymna~
sium. Work will begin soon after
classes start in gymnastics.

partment of town College worlrs

from the faculty SCtRLET AND
BLACK presents a few tncts con»
cerning Uncle Sam’s Club. To be-
gin with the club is proceeding
with all smoothness and the best
of prospects are opening up be-
iore it. Ayear ago work in the
boy's department (there is also
one forthe girls) was carried on
in two sections. one in
eluding older boys and theother
composed of smaller ones. The
larger division is tO‘be divided
this year into two sections, one of
boys ranging up to eleven years
and the other from eleven to
seventeen. About iorty are in

split in two.

The work of the club is such as
is congenial and proﬁtable to any
boy, They have a football team,
a track team, and a base ball team

of the college may subscribe with

feature of the club work is the
tact that the members theme

energy.
