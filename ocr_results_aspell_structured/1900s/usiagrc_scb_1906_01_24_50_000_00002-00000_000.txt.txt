HE election OI Dean Main to the
presidency will be a source of
gratiﬁcation to his many friends. His
iongoareer at Iowa College has endear
ed him to the alumni and student
body. He is in fact an Iowa College
man. His long training has especially
ﬁtted him for the arduous tllliries of
president. SCARLET AND BLACK offers
congratulations and wishes him along
and prosperous rule as president of the
hash college in the Wash.

OOTBALL must go. The death
knell was sounded when the
conference ollicials passed their dras-
tic measures of reform. With the
adoption of the resolutions by Lila lla-
dividual universities. Football as
now played will have become a matter
of history. This sudden demise,
though unexpected, will be looked up-
on by the lovers of true sportman-
ship asa wise move. The time has
come when modern football cannot be
justiﬁed in the light of present day
morals. We may be admirers of the
game yet the most enthusiastic and
the best informed could not square
himself with his conscience after wit
nessing a hard fought contest. It is
to be deplored that such evils have
crept in, yet such are the facts and as
such they cannot be denied. much less
covered up. Football has been a great
gameea manly game in its day but
we can now periorrn the last sad rites
'withoutreluctancc.and,sclar as we
are concerned. with satisfaction.

The question now arises, what at-
titude shall Iowa College take? We
believe that there is but one course
to follow and that is to adopt the con-
[el'ence recommendations. It may
work hardships and will probably
bring disappointment to some, yet if
Griunell is to uphold her reputation
as a leader and as an advocate of clean
athletics, it is imperative that the
present game with its corrupting in-
fluences be removed from our college
activities. The action may seem radir
cal to many, yetiii the light or what
has already been done by the lnsLlLu»
tions, Grihnell's path of duty ought
not to be hidden. No onedeuics that
our athletics have sullered from
the attendant evils of the game The
Herald demands that some facts be
given, The editor of SCAM AND
BLACK is ready tol'ilrulsllll ei once
anytime that the luciilty may call for
it. It is no longer a matter or per
sonalities buta matter of principle.
Can Iowa College people,7sburlencs,
friends and alumni be content to
calmly go their way and console them»
selves with the thought that Grln~
nell is free lrom all such illllucllces?

Can ive continue to play the part of
the Pliarisee and thank our creator
that we are not as other schools when

 

SCARLET

no one doubts Lhe‘trlllliiillness of
the statements which we made in
Seance BLACK last issue. We
have believed in football but the time
has passed When in order to enjoy the
game, we are willing to leave our eon-
science at home. No. we wanta game
which is fair, which is honest and
which is open and above board. The
present game cannot meet those re
quirements. It is not a question oi
policy but of ideals. Either football
must go or our moral code must be
lowered. Which will it be? We pre-
ter the former, and so does every stu-
dent who is true to himself and to his

convictions.
