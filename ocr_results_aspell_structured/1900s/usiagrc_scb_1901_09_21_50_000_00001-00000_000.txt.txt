Grinnell‘s Coach.

A week trom today will occur
what we may call the ﬁrst real
football game or our season. By
that time the team will begin to
get into some iorm,and we may
be ahle to make some guess at
what Grinncll's prospect tor the
year will be. To-day's game with
the alumni is the ﬁrst real try-out
for the men; but as we have had
no regular coach up to this time.
very little can be told by the re-
sult of to-day's game. But next
week the coach will be with the
team. and they will begin to work
into a sound organization. To
Grinnell. with her light team and.
for the most part. inexperienced
men, a good coach means every»
thing. A coach of little ability
or poor skill would mean certain
defeat. We must have a man
who will make the team play fast
and snappy ball. The men must
be ﬁlled with the dogged spirit or
hanging on and playing each man
ftir his Ille. to make up fur the
lack oi uvoirdupuis

Coach l‘ratt comes to us well

half-back. and last year played

oppoitunities to study the science

est teams in America, and is said
to have a thorough knowledge of
all the technicalities of the great
college game.

Mr. Tratt comes to Grinnell
with a season of hard work before
him. He has a squad or light and
