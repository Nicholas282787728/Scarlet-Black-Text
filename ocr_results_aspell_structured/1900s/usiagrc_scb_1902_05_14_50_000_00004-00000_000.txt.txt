THE lLLiNols TRIP.

Comment'on the Illinois trip
Moyg—io.isnnnecessary, Inlwo
of the games played Grinneii was
up in the air playing, the most
ragged kind oi ball.
dition was due partially to theiong
night's trip which put the team in
poor shape tor the strong teams
they were to meet. In the third
game the team tooka brace and
played the kind of ball they are
capable of. winning from a team
fully as strong as either orthe
two before which they had gone
down in defeat just previously.
The scare book availablc is nut
complete but as much of the play
as can be secured is given in
tabulated form below.
