The Oratorical Contest,

The home oratorical contest,
held the last Monday evening of
lastterm was one of the most suc-
cessfulonestllat haseverbccn held
here and augurs well for increased
interest in the future in tllis
department of college work. The
orations presented were all worthy
efforts and showed a great im-
provementovei previousattempts.

The winner, Mr. Crosby, is a
member of the sophomore class
and is an example of what may
be accomplished by persistent and
strenuous effort. His oration and
delivery this year are a marked
improvement over last year's. by
which he secured a place.

The program was opened by a
violin solo by Miss Laura Rcw,
“Gondolierc,” by Ries. Follow-
ingthis, Mr. McCarty spoke on
“Hamilton and the Beginning of
a Nation,” saying that very rapid
progress is usually tollowed by
retrogression. This was true at

 

the beginning of the nation. He
presented a vivid picture of the
American colonies after they had
gained freedom, Patriotism was
soon overcome by factional stlife.
Hamilton was the man who grasp-
ed the situation antl he in a large
measure secured tlle adoption of
the constitution. His life is inter
linked with the beginning of our
nation.

Miss Susie Orvis followed with
an oration on the subject. “Direct
Legislation." She said that pro
gress was from absolute monarchy
to representative government;
from representation of majority
to representation of all. Our
present system is a representation
of the majority, In the United
States the lZIWrmaking power is
too far separated trom the people.
She insisted that the introduction
of the initiative and referendum
is not revolutionary in its nature
and urged its adoption as a cure
for our present governmental

evils.
Miss Fultonspoke on “Lawless

ness” saying that law is a news
sity. Anarchy istheiesult of an
nlhilation of latv. In the early
settlement of our western country,
lawlessness was predominant.
Lynching is a survival of this law»
lessiless.

Mr. Macartney then sang “Out
on the Deep," by Liihr, and was
followed by Mr. R. H. Arnold,
who was awarded second place.
His subject was “Race Antag-
onism." Mr. Arnold said “Come
inon sentiments, interests and be
liefs mnke unity. Necessity tor
closet contact causes us to recog
nize existing diversities, Divers
sities of human life give rise to
different elements of civilization,
Aggressiveness and intolerance of
different races defeat ends of lace
diversities ill civilization."

Mr. S. Haines Crosbii spoke on
“Daniel Webster" He said that
great men are not always wise. In
clear comprehension ofall prob.
lems, however, Webster excelled
all men of his time. VVealcness
and concession are evident in his
efforts, but the last twenty years,
while showing a waning of his
genius, also show a mastery clhis
baser elements. ‘

Mr. I. T, Velin spoke on “Pei-
sollalityisocial Energy” and was

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL. IOWA. SATURDAY, JANUARY 6, [900a

awarded third place. He sai
“This is an age of activity Chris
tianity is the greatest revolution
of the world, This is A birthtime
of ideas, revealing the plans of
God in man. Moral courage is
needed now to oppose popular
opinion. What we want is not
ecnoes of the past, but effort along
advanced lines.
