SATURDAV’S GAME.

Pum- Showing by Varslty and Unexrl

men—Score do.

Many spectators were somewhat dis?
appointed in the showing which tliei
Varsity made in the name with the
second and freshmen teams Saturday.
It was largely a trial contest, testing
tire qualities orthe participants and
the success or the new plays which
were tried tor the ﬁrst time.

The VaISlLy began the inst hall
against the “scrubs" by making a
touchdownin the ﬁrst three minutes
or play and succeeded in kicking goal,
making the score ii to 0. Neither side
was able to score further throughout
the hall. 'nlie play or the Varsity was
characterized by several brilliant end
runs and line plunges, but each time
when the goal was approached the ball
was seeurcd by the “scrubs” through
a tumble and with the aid oi the wind
was puntcd [or into the "al'sity’s ter-
ritory.

In the second hair with the Fresh-
men, the \'arsity tailed worse than
with their former opponents. At no
time during the hall was the ball car-
ried over the goal. Several drop tricks
were tried by the Freslllllon, none of
which succeeded The i .ward pass
upon which the Yarsny counted most,
proved disastrous to thorn. in until y
every case the catcher was tloivnetl in
his tracks or the ball was lost ona
rumble.

Tire Varsity was to a certain extent
handicapped byilie wind and the dust
which blcw against them, and also by
the tact that they were lnet by iresli
men at the beginnlntr or the second

llnl'. But inking: these inings inlo
