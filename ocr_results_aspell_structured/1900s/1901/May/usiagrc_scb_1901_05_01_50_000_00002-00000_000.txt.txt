glt is sometimes observed that

yollng‘ athletes on the track
are bashful about pushing theme
selves torwnrd and taking ad
vantage of every opportunity ol-
tered tor training. They tcel that
their ' lily is worthy of no at-
tention and dislike to make tilcl‘n‘
selves at all conspicuous. This
feeling is natural. but one which

No Grinnell man, who sincerely
tries, is ever held in do on be-

the contl'arytllefeelingofbrotllcl'-
hood and of a common aim is
noticeable among all candidates
on the track. This being the case
it is hoped all track ineri, old and
new wtll enterthe Home Meet
next Saturday afternoon. None
need l’eel timid. as the Home
Meet is intended for everybody.
It is the last opportunity of the
season for netv men to get into a
contest, and it is at such times
that many and many a new man
has surprised himself and others.
After the notable examples of
what training has done in the past
tor some extremely awkward and
unskilled athletes, no one hasa
good reason ior feeling discourag-
ed about himself. This being the
case, letdifﬁdence keep no man
out of tile meet Saturday. The
new men are watched much more
closely titan they themselves
know, for in time they must .be
