Iowa Wins Silver Bat.

By a score of 17 to 12 Iowa des
leatcd Grinnell at Grinnell yesterr
day in the second otthe college
league games. The victory gives
Iowa the silver bat for another
year by the tollowing percentage:

\V L I’, C
Iowa 2 1.000
Arncs 1 .500
Grinnell 0 .000
Cornell 0 .000

The Grinncll- Arnes and Grin-
nell-Cornell games have not yet
been played. Np IowarCornell
game has been scheduled and
none will be played, owing to
Iowa's refusal to play at Mount
Vernon after Cornell's disgrace
tul treatment of her team there
last year.

The silver bat, the trophy of
the Iowa InterrColiegiate Base
Ball League, has an interesting
history. Ames won it in :893
and l894. It was won by Iowa
in 1895 and by Grinnell in 1896,
Grinnell held it in 1897. The
tollbwing year it was won by
Cornell, in 1899 by Grinnell, and
in 1900 and 1901 by Iowa. In all
Iowa has won it three times, Grin-
nell two times, Ames twice, and
Cornell once and it was held
once by Grinnell. It Iowa wins

it next year, she will be entitled
to retain it as a permanent trophy.

On account of the temporary

unﬁtness of Grinnell’s athletic
park, ycsterday'sgame was played
on the campus near the gymnasi-
um. The diamond was very
rough, which rendered clean, so
curate ﬁelding impossible. As
usual Iowa made an unpardonable
number of errors, but her opp0~
nents were much weaker at bat.
Iowa made eighteen hits tor a
total of twenty-two bases. Willi~
ams led in batting witll'athree
base hit. Our team was accorded
the best ot treatment by Grinnell,
and the game was played without
a single unpleasant feature.#Vir
