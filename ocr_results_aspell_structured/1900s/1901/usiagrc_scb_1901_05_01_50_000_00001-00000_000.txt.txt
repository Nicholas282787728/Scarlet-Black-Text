Highland Park Wins by 3 to 0.

Intercollegiate base ball made
its initial appearance tor the pres»
ent season at Grinnell in the game
between Highland Park and Grinr
nell on thccaznpus diamond yes-
terday afternoon. A notvery great
nor enthusiastic crowd of fans
was out to witness the event, and

advantage of the absence of the
protecting fence arountl the Ward

game for the most part, the few
costly errors being tallied tip

bat, but this was in a measure ex~
cusable, owing to Thompson's ex-
cellent form in the box. No bat-
ting averagcs were tattencd tr-om
his pitching. Llal'k’s work for
Grinnell was good, though not
quite tip to the usual standard.

The ﬁrst two innings resulted in
outs in one, two, three order. Afr
fairs began to grow critical in the
ﬁrst half of the third inning when
with one man out Deming walked
to ﬁrst, was advanced to third by
a poor throw to second from Ab-
bott's single and scored on
Osmunds' 'ingle. W. F. Smith

Monahan struck out, endingwhat

Grinnell. In the 4th inning R.
Smith hit safely to Fisk and was
advanced on Thompson's out to
