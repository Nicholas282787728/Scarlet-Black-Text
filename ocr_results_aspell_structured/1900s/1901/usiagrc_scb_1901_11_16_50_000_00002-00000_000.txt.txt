HE statenientlias been made

repeatedly, in the college
papers of the 5 ie. and the Des
Moines dailies, that Gl‘lnnell has
ateam of veterans. We are unable
to see what is the foundation for
these statements. It is so far from
the truth. in fact. that we feel
compelled to protest against its
circulation. It may be that there
is a natural tendency on the part
of the defeated teams to
that it is the veteran coinposniiiii
of the opposing teams, that is re
sponsible for the outcome. At
any rate. the tenth illtll litivo been
defeated by Gi-iinieil tail.
without exception, belt:\c‘,
have made assertions l|l<:‘ those.
concerning our team. The facts
will hardly bear out the assertion.

on what such a statement is based.
