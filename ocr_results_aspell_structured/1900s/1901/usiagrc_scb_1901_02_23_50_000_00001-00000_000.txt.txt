Grinnell Defeats Iowa 16 to l3.

Grinnell showed adecided im-
provement in basket throwing in
the game with Iowa at the men's
gymnasium Wednesday afternoon.
It was the one point in which the
team was weak in the game with
Des Moincs Y, M. C. A., but the
form shown Wednesday was the
best ever witnessed in the gymnan
sium. The team work wasa triﬂe
inferior to that of the Hawkeye
representatives. The game start-
edsomewhatuninterestingly. Al-
though the score at the end of the
ﬁrst half was 6 to 6, the impression
left with the spectators was that
neither side had exerted itself very
much.

The playing of the second half
was of a decidedly different char-
acter, being fast and brilliant.
Iowa secured the ﬁrst basket, Wil-
liams manipulating the sphere.
Grinnell then ran up six points
which Iowa succeeded in tying be-
fore time was called. In the sec
ond half Grinnell rolled up ten
points while Iowa was securing
one, making the score stand 15 to
7 atone time. The latter then
took a brace and secured three base
kets in the last few minutes of the
game. The second half wasa dem-
onstration or ﬁerce playing from
start to ﬁnish and even aroused a
tardy enthusiasm among the spec-
tators.

McKeag and James were the
stars for Grinnell, while the work
of Williams and Rule shed a lustre
over the playing or their oppo-
nents. McKeag threw baskets in
a manner that callsed the onlookn
ers to wonder ifit was possible for
him to miss, and James at guard
was so effective that criticism
would be impossible.

Literature as Art and Life.

Prof. Burton's lecture of last
evening was an ex emplilieation
of the function of a lecture course
in a community, It was an earn-
est and careful discussion of cer-
tain vital literary questions, which
were presented in a way not too
abstract or technical for the
average hearer, He brought
with him a message which lie pre
sented in an interesting and efr
fective way.

It is perhaps dueto hisyears of
journalistic experience, that Mr.
Burton’s point of view is not
merely that ota school man, but
his consideration of his subject
kept in vrew throughout the larger
reading public—the unlettered
public, iEyou please. That which
attracts the multitudes to books is
their interest in life.

Henry James says that the
interest is of two kindsithe inn
terest or' recognition and the in.
terest otsurprisc. The interesl of
the former kind is to be found in
such books as David I‘Iarum and
Eben Holden, while the interest
of the latter kind is seen in the
recent demand for the historical
romance. Literature is a pre.
sentation of life and art in litera
ture is secured when the materials
are so selected that life is pre-
sented in terms of beauty and of
power.

Mr. Burton deprecated the
tendency in the part of a younger
school ofwriters to over emphan
size the importance or technique
mclaiming that not, what is done,
but how it is done is of prime imr
portance. Literature is not a
mere abstraction but is measured
by the personality behind it,
Dickens, Carlyle and Whitman
in letters, Wagner in music and
Burne Jones in painting, were all
inartistic in workmanship, bllt
nevertheless were great artists be-
cause ot dynamic personalities.
Stevenson, the speaker regarded
as an excellent example of one
in whose work is the union of
careful, artistic workmanship, and
a large personality.

The audience was exceedingly
attracted throughout the lecture,
and there were many expressions
of regret that the speaker did not
continue longer.

 

No Dual Meet: with Iowa,

“Grinnellinschedulingthe early
(late at May4 for the dual meet
with Iowa has securcrl a great ad»
vantage, owing to the ﬁne prelim-
inar-y training that her men can
get in her new gymnasium, while
Iowa will have to wait until the
coming of warm weather before
she can even begin to train. Grin-
nell may Very likely win the dual
meet because of this advantage."
in'zt’au- Riporlﬂ.

The above is typical or a Hume
ber of articles that have recently
been written from Iowa City, and
so directly opposed tothe [acts or
the case that a correction seems
to be in order at this time.

In the ﬁrst place the meet re»
terred to had even been declared
off before the above article was
published. Last year Iolva and
Grinnell met on May 11; this year
the S. U, I, management went
ahead and scheduled other meets
for both May II and 18, lvhile
Grinnell was arbitrarily given her
choice between May 4 and no
meet. She has chosen the latter.

Such action on the part of Iowa
was contrary to the letter and
spirit of all dual league relations.
But all this might have been over!
looked had the date offered been
at all satisfactory. As is well
known, the comparative youth and
inexperience oi Grinnell's track
material makes her dependent
largely upon taithtul trainingi
outdooras well as indoor. The ex-
perience of the past few years
shows that her track men always
appear at their best against other
schools late in the season. The
new track at Ward Field will not
be completed until about May I,
and outdoor work will of course be
considerably delayed on that ac-
collnt, With these facts in View
Grinnell could not reasonably be
expected to accept the one vacant
date in Iowa’s schedule.

Tlie‘question orsubstituting for
all literary degrees, the degree of
bachelor of arts is being consider
ed at the University of Michigan.

called, is in use in many Ameri-
