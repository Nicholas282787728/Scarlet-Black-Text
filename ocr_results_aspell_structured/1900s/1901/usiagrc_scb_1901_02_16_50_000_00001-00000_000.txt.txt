Something About tht Next Num»
her of the Yr Mi C. A. Course.
Next Friday's lecture on “Lit-

erature as Art and Personality"

will be the distinctly “literary”
number of the Y. M, C, A. course.

The theme is a literary one. and
the lecturer is a literary man, by
instinctgas an examination of his
pub shed writings oi verse and
essay will indicateiand by trains
ing, as a record of the external

- facts ot his life goes to show.

Prof. Burton was born at Hart
ford, Conni. in 1859. He received
his A. B. degree at Trinity College
in r883, and Ph, D. atJolins Hop-
kirlsin 1887. He taught Anglo-
Saxon iorayearatlohns Hopkins,
was managing editor of the N. Y.
Chart/mum, 1888—9. literary editor
'ofCharles Dudley Warner'spaper,
the l-lartiord Caitmnt, isoo.7, and
in ‘98 he became Protessor oi
English Literature in the Univer-
sity oi Minnesota, whele he now
is.

As a lecturer on literaly topics
gwhether speaking in the class
room or irom the public platform
#he has proved a great success.
An explanation of the interest he
is able to arouse in his subject lies
in the fact that he insists that there
shall be no divorce of litcrature
from life. The title of his recent
volume of verse, “Lyrics of Broth-
erhood,” fairly characterizes his
literary spirit. His article in the
last Forum on “The Dark in Lite
erature” isatimely plea forbeauty
and sanity in literature, which in
these “decadent” days is lctresh-
ing enough,

It is an interesting and vital sub-
ject that will be treated, and those
who attend the lecture may be
sure otspendiiig an enjoyable and
proﬁtable evening.

 

The May Festival Will bea

Reality.
. The May Festival is now an as-
sured fact. The required three
hundred names, which were neces-
sary to ensure the ﬁnancial side of
this undertaking, have been sev
cured, and we can consider our-
selves fortunate in not permitting
the orchestra to make an engage
ment with some other state insti-
tution or town and thus deprive
us of the musical feature of the
year.

The May Festival will be held
on the 13th and 14th of May. The
scheme otpresentation need not
he again repeated at this time,
having been caretully explained
in previous issues. It is without
doubt the largest undertaking in
its line Grinnell has ever ventured
upon and judging from the time
and energy put upon it. the ven-
ture can not but meet all expectae
tions.

April 4th. 5th, and 6th, the facul-
ty has decided to bring the winter
term to aclose on Wednesday.
April 3rd. two days earlier than
the time scheduled in the cata-
logue. This arrangement will cx-
tend the length of the Easter re-
cess to two weeks, lacking one
day, ior no action has been taken
by the taculty to begin the spring
term any eailier. This early d15~
missal was thought necessary by
the faculty because of the large
number or delegates who are eXr
pected to attend the gathering.
The association is composed of
members ranging irom school
teachers to college presidents,
and because of the many individur
al meetings which will he held. it
will be necessary to hold the
smaller meetings in the chapel
and recitation rooms. This would
greatly intertere with our daily
routine and make classroom work
next to impossible. The larger
gatherings will be held in the audi-
toriums of the various churches.
On the evening of the fourth a
reception will be tendered to the
visiting delegates in one of the
gymnasiums.

Forpurposesofintormation and
satisfaction, effort is being
made to collect the names of all
those who me now doing graduate
work in some of the institutions
oi the country. It is a source of
pride to know that so many Iowa
College students develop into ef-
ﬁcient scholars and pursue higher
worlr along special lines, it is de-
sired to keep a record of all such
students, and any who care to take
the trouble can greatly help mat-
tcrs by brieny iiiiorrning Pres.
Main concerning the college or
university in which they are lo—
cated and the line of work pur-
sued. Without such aid it is very
likely that some names will be
omitted.
