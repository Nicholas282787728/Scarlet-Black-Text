[The general recital of the
School of Music last Saturday
evening in the Con‘gregational
church tirade a ﬁtting close to the
work (lone by the School of Music
pupils during the year. A large
and appreciative audience greeted
the performers. ‘

The platform was tastefully
decorated with palms and cut
ﬂowers and added much to the
enjoyment of the evening.

Mrs. Umbenhauer, School of
Music, '97, opened the program
with an organ number, Marcia;
Fantastica, 013.4, No.6, by Barr'
giel.

Of the piano selections Miss
Fagan, Miss Braden and Missi’
Meader deserve special mention.
Miss Pagan in the Bachmann Les
Hirondelleswasparticularly pleas-
ing. It required a dainty elastic
touch which she was well able to
give it. The Album Leaf by
Hlavac, and the erenlied, Op.
211, Kirchner, were played very
artistically by Miss Harriet
Meader. /

Miss Cadwcll, one of the grad-
uates of the piano department,
sang very charmingly Bullard's
“The Lass of Norwichtoivn" with
violin obligato by Miss Rew.
Miss Cadwcll has a very sweet
voice and sings With much feeling.

Prof, Olds, the voice instructor,
played all the accompaniments of
the evening, showing his skill in
that direction as well as in voice
training.

The other vocal numbers were
given ,by Miss Emma Johnson
and Miss Bessie Ricker, both of
whom have sweet voices though
not strong. Miss Ricker sang,
“In Dreamland”, by Dennee, with
much expression,

A new and interesting feature
of the program was the Schubert
sonata tor piano and violin, Op.
317. played by Miss Bobzin of the
graduating class and Mr. Stetltmtn
Noble.

The Violin quartette consisting
of Miss Crowell, Messrs. Temple-
ton, I’arks and Noble was also
good. They played a Fete
Champetr Op. 24, by Allen. —

Miss Cudwell and Miss Bobzin
cacti played pianosolos intheir
usual happy manner. The evens
ing pleasure was concluded by

 

two organ numbers, a Grieg
Elegiac Melody, 013.34, No. 2,
and a Gavotte in is flat. by

Handel, played by Mrs, Umbenr
hatter.

The recital was one of the most
entertaining and interesting ever
given here. Very much praise
should be given I’t'of. and Mrs.
Cole and their assistants, for the
easy manner in which the whole
program passed on. It makes
one more pleasant evening due to
the untiring energy and work of

 

 

EScarlet anb JBIaclt

Prof, Cole and the
Mus Faculty.

Itis with the sincerest regret
that the students and people of
Gi-innell think oi Mr. and Mrs,
Coles' departure.

’Varsity VS. Alumni.

About a hundred people who
braved the hottest of Old Sol's
rays yesterday saw a very pretty
game of ball between the Alumni
and the ’Varsity of Iowa College.
Before the ﬁrst two innings were
over it was plain that neither side
would have an easy time in beat-
ing the other. Although the
game was begun at a late hour,
nine innings were played. Tire
scoring began in the ﬁrst. Davis
led off with agteasy inﬁeld hit
and succeeded in beating it out.
Coggeshall repeated the trick and
landed the runner on third from
where he scored on Somers' sacri»
ﬁce. The next two batters were
easy and the 'Varsity took its
turn. Fisk set the example with
a two hagger and scored on
Clarke‘s imitation of it. The
score at the beginning of the se-
cond was one and one, Both
sides scored two in the second
and later tied again at live each.
In the eighth Manatt scored the
run that put the college team in
the lead.

The features of the game were
Marsh’s difﬁcult catches of fouls
and the abundance of wild throws
on the part of the Alumni.
Tirompson for the ’Varsity excr
cuted one dorrble play alone and
handled the business end of ans

Alumni Address.

The annual address before the
Alunrni Association was given last
night in the Congregational
church by F. I. Her‘r‘iot|,'90. The
program was introduced by a pipe
organ selection by Pr‘of.Co|e, atter
which J, P, Lyman introduced Mr,
Harriett. of Des Moilres, who
spoke upon tlrcsubject, “Force of
Example."

Quoting from Ammiel that the
world needs mOl'C ot "practical
righteousness" than rhetoric to
keep nations front disintegration.
the speaker proceeded to enforce
the idea that in this country at the
prescntrimewe arein danger ofbe-
licvingthat“verbiageisan efficient
substitute for will, conscience and
education." It has become come
mon and quite fashionable to point
out social or political evils but we
do not always possess ourselves
with the energy sufﬁcient‘to erad~
icate them. The speaker insisted
that while ﬂamboyant or compla»
cent optimism about onr's being
the best of governments was fool-
ish, pessimism was no lcss futile
furore, it was worse. for like a
canker it at the nerve
centres of society, and destroyed
trope, courage and the desire to
do things well. What we need is
aquickening otrheindividual cone
science and of our sensc of social
obligation, arealization of our rese
ponsibilrties for the well~bcing of
others in so far as the personal or-
social conduct of the individual
can aﬁcctthc general welfare. It
is the indifference of the rntlividr
ual to the social well-being that
has permitted many of the evils of
our government to grow.

Quoting Emerson to the effect
that we seldom really appreciate
a principle until we see it in the
light of a fact, Mr. Herr-tort pro-
ceeded to illustrate his thesis and
enforce his thought by the lite of
the late Joshua M. Chamberlain,
and he virtrrally gave his audience
a chapter from life, He gave a
verbatim report of an extended
conversation wrtlr Mr. Chambers
lain in 1895, wherein the college
librzuritn explained his social pliil
osophy and demonstrated his
“practical righteousness,” The
occasion was Mr. Chamberlain's
beautiful
long bccn the standard of excel-
lcncc in Gtitlncll.

Mr. Chamberlain set about to
improve his house prenr. s [or
the express purpose of inﬂuencing
his neighbors and lellow-crtizcns

struck in

lawn which all know has

 

 

 

   

duce them to do likewise. The
force oi his example became a
moral pressul‘cland in time pro-
duced precisely what he sought.
tor-,nthers began to do likewise
and the city of Gl‘innell has be
come noteworthy for the beauty
of its lawns. By other incidents
in Mr. Chamberlain’s life Mr. Her-
riott enforced the lesson he sought
to convey, that we should each do
our part to improve our commune
al lire. '

Prof. Cole’s Successor Chosen.

Sixteen members of the board
of trustees were present to take
part, Saturday morning, in the
business of the corporation, ﬁve
of whom were resident members.
A great deal of routine business
was attended to, and many appli-
cations ior positions were consid-
ered. Untofscverul applicantsthe
board elected Mr. H. W. Matlaclt
of Oberlin, Ohio, to succeed Pro-
fcssor Cole as director of the
School of Music. Mr. Matlack
graduated from the department of
music at Oberlin in 1897. and since
then has been pursuing a classics
al course at the same school. He
comes highly recommended as a
successiirrcomposer and orches

tra leader.

Rev, Ephraim Adams.

It is a great pleasure to all the
triends of Iowa College to
have the presence of Rev. Eph-
raim Adams, of Waterloo, at the
Commencement exercises. Rev,
Adams is thc senior member of
the Board of trustees. and was its
secretary a half century ago. He
also has the distinction of being a
member of the Iowa Band, who
rounded Iowa College, and rvhose
work has meant so much to Iowa
and the middle west. I’Ic has al-
ways been an ardent supporter ot‘
the college and during the ﬁfty
four years of its existence. he has
rendered it most efﬁcient aid.
His presence connects the past
with the present, and is an in.
spiration to all who are interested
in the growth of the college.
