ZEHE question otthe adoption

at a permanent form to.-
an Annual has been agitated sev-
eral times in Iowa College. but no
action has ever been taken upon
it, the torm ot the Annual being
left entirely to the discretion 0[
the individual board, While the
present systemI peihaps. offers
greater room for the display of
originality, it is a question \vhcth-
er a ﬁxed form would not be more
satisfactory to the body of stu-
dents as a whole. For a number
of successive years the Cyclone
was issued. This was in the form
or the Annuals gotten out by most
of our western univeisities and
which is being adopted by many
of the smaller institutions, These
Annuals. such as the Minnesota
cop/icy tor example. contain a
contemporary history of lhe insti-
tution, biographies ot instructors,
the work of literary and athletic
associations, makinga really villu-
able book. The advantage of hav-
ing sucha Fixed form is evident.
In this way the college has an un-
broken iiistoiy of its progress
along all lines. A deviation in the
form of a play or a book of short
stories, while it may be very ens
tertaining, ncveitheless, even it it
be the best of its kind, cannot take

 

greater interest to a former stil-
cicnt than a book which only i'epr
lesents the individuality of the
board whose work it is.

The Public Recital.

Only a small number of listen»
as were in attendance at the pubr
lic pcrtoi niance givenby Conserve
Atory pupils last Saturday after
noon. These recitals are made
public just once a term, and one
would expect more enthusiasm to
be shown by outsiders, though in
this particular case the weather
was the disturbing element. The
weather also effected the program,
numbers 3, 4, 7, lo being omitted
through the indisposition or the
pzirtiCIpanls. Theremaining num-
beis were very nicely executed.
