GATES TO CHEYENNE.

The announcement is made on
ofﬁcial authority that our former
president, Geo. A. Gates, is per-
mantly located in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. As is well known, Dr.
Gates was uncertain for some
time intojust what work he would
enter. A number of opportunities
were opened to him in various
parts of the country, offering dife
ferent kinds of labor. Among
these came a call from Cheyenne.
This mountain torvn is largely
composed of miners and railroad
men. and offers about the line of
work he had had in mind, and
which correspond most closely
with his inclinations. This latter
call he accepted, and is now in-
stalled as pastor of the First Con-
gregational church. Cheyenne
will be his permanent address.
All his old friends in Grinnell are
gratiﬁed to hear that our former
president is located to his satis-
faction, and wish to publicly ex.
press their desire to hear of him
from time to time either through
the press or through private
channels.

Commencement Speakerr

Dr. George Herbert Palmer,
professor ot Ethics at Harvard
University and for many years
the head of the philosophical de-
partmcnt, has consented to come
to deliver the commencement ad-
dress next June.

Protessor Palmer may ﬁtly be
called the artist teacher of Hare
vard. During the twenty-six
years he has taught at Harvard his
supreme ambition has been to
raise -teaching into a ﬁne art.
With him teaching is an end in
itself, not a means to some further
end. To this end he has bent all
his energies. owing to this he
has published but few books, the
the principal ones being translar
tions of Homer's Odyssey and
Sophocles’ Antigone into poetical

 

prose. and a book ‘on English
Style. His Noble [calmer all
Ethics, delivered last year, are to
be published this winter and will
doubtless prove one of the most
suggestive and dcliglitfulcontribur
tions to the subject made for some
time. While Professor Palmer
has begrudged the time for pubs
hshing because of his love for art,
he has become probably the most
successrul teacher of his subject
in the country. Whereas the
philosophical student goes to hear-
him on accountof hisphilosophio
a1 suggestivcness. the lover of
beautiful English goes to hear
him as the master of style, and
the pedagogue as a master of
method. His fame‘ as a teacher
has spread all over this country;
and he cannot begin to meet the
many calls, outside his busy Har»
vard life, for lectures, commence
ment addresses, etc.

As the dean of the philosophic
al department he has been in a
peculiar sense the father of his
students. He has had no intern
ests in fact but thcirs; their suCr
cesses have been his successesand
their failures his failures. During
his many years of service he has
been called upon to nominate men
for responsible positions allover
this country and has Won the
universal conﬁdence of heads of
institutions.

Professor Palmer is no stranger
to Iowa college, He has always
taken a keen interest in the Con-
gregational institutions in this
country, He has already furnish-
ed two professors for our own
college, and it is only because of
a warm personal interest in us
that he could be induced to travel
across the country, the busiest
time of the year, to be with us

Clark-Chase Concert Recital.

Last evening a Grinnell audi-
ence had the privilege of hearing
one of the best numbers of the Y.
M. C. A. lecture course, That the
people of this community can ape
preciate a high class musical pro-
gram was evinced by the large at-
tendance and by the nranncr in
which the per[ormers held the at»
tention of their audience. This
concert had long been looked for—
ward to, by. those of musical tab

 

IOWA COLLEGE, GRINNELL, IOWA, SATURDAY, JANUARY 26, IQOI.

ent, as one of the most enteltain-
ing events of the year, We are
sure that this concert met, and in
fact, surpassed the expectations
of all lovers of music.

Mr, Clark, the baritone soloist,
is a singer of great notc. He sings
with perfect ease even the most
dimcrrltselections; hisappearancc
on the stage is one that commands
attention. One of the pleasing
features was his clear enunciation,
This is something which is rarely
attained, especially to such an ex
tent as it is by Mr. Clark. Even
in the German songs. one who had
a little knowledge of the language
could easily follow the words.

Miss Chase, the pianist, won the
admiration other audience‘ by the
unassuming and graceful manner
in which she rendered her selec-
tions, which were strictly high
class musical numbers. Miss Chase
felt pcriectly at ease and proved
that she had that musical talent
for which she is so well known in
this part of the country.

It would indeed be unfair not to
give mention to the accompanist,
who eliciterl many a favorable res
mark upon her ability in this line.

The lecture course committee
can congratulate themselves upon
being able to procure such a cone
cert as was given last night.

Chicago Alumni Banquet.

It is practically settled that the
meeting and banquet of the Chis
cago Alumni Association of Iowa
College will be held on the even-
ing of Feb. 22. The committee in
charge'has completed the list of
toasts, and believes the program
will prove the most attractive the
association haseverprescnred. It
has become a well established pres
cedent that the speakers shall not
consider the occasion worthy of
nothing better than mere extents
polaneous effort, but give to their
subjects the consideration they de-
serve. The friends of the school
may feel assured that this rule will
be honored this year.

Thecommittee is anxioustopl'os
