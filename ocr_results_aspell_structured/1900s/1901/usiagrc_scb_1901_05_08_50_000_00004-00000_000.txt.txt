In the sprints all these schools
are strong. Pack of Amcs has

Tanncr and James of Ames.
Drakc has the best of it in the
distances with Emerson, Iaggm'd
and Thompson as against Coatcs
of Ames and Don Evans, though
Grinnell Cxpecls points in these
events. ,

In the hurdles Griiiiieli hopes
to win both ﬁrsts while Lamb and
Lyttle of Ames will probably take
the other points from Captain
Lhapman of Drake. In the jumps
Drake has everything her DIV"
way according to this year’s
records. Giahani in the high and
hop step has records that are
rathcr appalling to Grinnell with
Haines out of the high jump on
account of hismjured foot. In
the pole vault Chapman and Fell
of Drake have both done to feel.
