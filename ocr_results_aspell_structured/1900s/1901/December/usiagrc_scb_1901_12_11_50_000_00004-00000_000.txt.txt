The above choice for all allrcol-
lege team forlown, excluding the
State University, taken from the
Inn/ml of last Saturday is interest-
ing to the colleges In gencrul we
would consider the choice of a
team a good one. One more men
ti-otn Griiinell should have gone
in the brick ﬁeld, Henry Lyman,
AtAines Lyman clearly outplayed
Coye and would probably have
been given 1 place by the 1111-1111
if he had not been kept out of the
Iowa and Drake games by injur-
ies. This would give Grinnell the
entire hack ﬁeld in the all-state
team, Our back ﬁeld this year
was remarkably strung. out rank-
ing that of the State University in
almost every way. Benson and
Handel are also mentioned as
among the coming players of the
state. Mention might be made of
the statement that Don Evans has
played tour years as h1ltb1cle.

ns has only been at Grinnell
three years and has been regular
Varsity halfback tor only two of
them. Yet. on the whole, Grinnell
may be well pleased with ,the
Iowa/1': choice as she is with the
season that has just closed. The
season of 1901 has witnessed for
Grinnell, not only the develop.
merit of a strong team, ranking
second in the state, but 1 genuine
revival oflhe old “Grinncll spirit,”
which tor years 111s 1ni1111ted

 

Grinnell athletics and won us vic-
tories ovcr opponents stronger in
almost every w1y.

THE CHRISTMAS FA1R.

The fair which the Y. W. C. A.
girls gave Sailllday evening was
successfulin every respect. Booths
were ﬁtted tip 111 the gymnasium
fertile sale of articles; the central
one was decorated in scarlet and
black and at others the colors of
the dihcreut classes p1ev1iled
There were also candy 1nd Japa-
nesebcoths. Attllelatter,teaand
wafers was served free to all
comers.

The demand for the alticles on
exhibition was so great that all
were sold by nine o’clock. The
1111 was designed as 1 social event,
ﬁnancial gain being 1 secondary
consideration. But it proved to
be as much of a ﬁnancial its it was
a social success. the sum received
1beve 111 expenses being about
$125.00.

The extract given below from
the Daily Ian/ml will be news to
Messrs. Harris and Tratt as well as
to the peoplecrcrinnell. The re»
Iations between these gentlemen
during the week Mr. Harris was in
Grinncll were cordial in the ex-
tremc. Only his work at Rush
Medical prevented his slaying
longer in Grinnell to assist Coach
Tratt.

"The Glinnell season has been
noteworthy for the absence from
the Grinnell learn of “Doc” Harris,
the brainy head coach who has
developed such strong teams [or
the Scarlet and Black in the past,
“Doc" did indeed return to Grin-
nell attlle beginning otilie season,
but Trait wanted no head coach
and altcr a week at coolness, I-lzlr-
ris went back to Lhicago and Grin-
nell had abandoned her graduate
system of coaching ”
