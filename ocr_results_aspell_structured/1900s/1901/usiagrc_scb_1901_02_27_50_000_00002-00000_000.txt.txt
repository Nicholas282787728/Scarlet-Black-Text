QED ituvinl

$RINNELL is to have no

Faculty Concert this year.
This decision has ﬁnally been
forced upon Prof. Cole and the
others interested in its production,
much to their regret and inﬁnitely
more to the regret oi the musics
loving people of Grinncll. The
faculty concert has come to be as
much of an aSstired event each
year as the glee club concert, and
its omission this winter Wlll be a
source or surprise to the students
and town people. The reason
given is the dearth of suitable
open dates. Nearly‘ every Friday
night ot this winter term has been
ﬁlled by a concert, lecture or an
important social function. Those
few evenings upon which nothing
occurred were some eitllcr pre-
ceding or closely following the
scheduled concerts at the year.
and as it was not thought advis-
able to have musical elltcrtatn-
merits occur in such close sticccs-
sion, the wisdom of omitting the
concert deemed evident.
Friends at the Conservatory trust
that a like complication will not
take place next year.

SHORT time ago SCARLET
BLACK stated that, as a re
stilt oi the lecture given by Prof.

Norris. the lligh School Athletic
Union was out of debt and had a
surplus oi Sis in the treasury.
This was wrong. Fifteen dollars
was cleared on the lecture and that
amount applied to the wiping
away of the tleht. but the union is
still taking care or a burdensome
deﬁcit and does not wish to go on
record as being tree l'rom debt
when the reverse is true.
