Smith-Everett: Society Forfeit:
Debatel

Word has been received from
theSmitheEverettsociety ofSimp-
son College, stating that it will be
impossible for them to meet the
Chresto‘mathian society in debate
this year. This comes as a sure
prise and something of a disap-
pointment to students at Grinnell.
as the time set for the debate is
lessthan amonth awayi Forsome
time arrangements have been pro-
gressing smoothly. The compact
has been agreed upon, ratiﬁcations
exchanged.tlle question and sides
chosen, and the debaters working
hard upon the debate. It is some~
thing ofa surprise, therefore, that
without warning and at such a late
date one of the societies should
withdraw. Theonlyreasonsgiven
by the SmithsEverett society for
their withdrawal are that some of
their best men are interested in
the two intercollegiate debates,
thus weakening their society team
and decreasing the interest, and
the fact that their society is so ins
cumbered with debt that it is not
ﬁnancially able to hold the debate,
In the ﬁrst case the same is in a
measure true of the Chrestomathi-
an society, two of its members be-
ing upon the college team and two
others on the College Debating
Union executivecommittec. so this
is not: a material obstacle to the de-
bate, In the second instance, if
the debate was well managed it
should not only not be a burden
ﬁnancially but mighteven be made
to liquidate the society debt.
Their reasons become still more
dubious when it is remembered
that there is not one of these cir-
cumstances but what must have
been clearly forseen atthe time the
contract was ratiﬁed by the Smith-
Everett society.

 

Although, as their communica
tion says."we ofcourse best tinder-
stand our siluation,which is indeed
too serious to warrant our enters
ing the debating arena with any
school", yet having signed the
compact,while clearly understand-
ing the situation, and conducting
arrangements up to within a month
of the debateiit is plainly incum~
bant upon the society (in spite of
“the dissenting faction") to abide
bytheiragreement, Failuretodo

Concerning Rev. Geo. A. Gates.

A copy of the Cheyenne Daily
Lead” contains an extended ac»
count of a movement in that city
in which Rev. Gates is taking an
active part. Cheyenne is a place
of [2,000 inhabitants and is almost
entirely a railroad town. Increase
in population has run far ahead
of increase in homes. and the
problem before the people is to
provide houses which can be mod~
erately bought or rented. owing
to his vast experience with young
people and his ability to deal with
men in the aggregate, Rev. Mr.
Gates is 2| recognized factor and
leader in this general endeavor to
better the resident facilities ofthe
city. At a banquet held recently,
where to; prominent business
men were present, he spoke very
pointedly andwith good sugges-
tions.

He was also a very great
aid to Pres. Burt of the Union
Paciﬁc R. R. in completing the
plans of a railway Club House for
employees, to bebuilt immediates
ly at the cost of $30,000. By
special request he came to Omar
ha and consulted with the presis
dent and chief engineer of the
road before the ﬁnalarrangements
were made.

Aspreviouslyintimatedln Schne
LET AND BLACK, news from our
former president is always web
come. The pleasure which he
himself feels in his present activi-
ty and success isreﬂected by his
friends in Grinnell,

__.+.—
The Hospital Movement.

Last Sunday morning Rev. Mr,
Vittum discussed the subject of a
city hospital. In the evening a

 

frec parliament permitted an ex
change ofviews, town and college
pcople alike taking part. The de
sire is to found a permanent and
hospitable establishment, where
the sick may ﬁnd good service and
pleasant accomodnlions at reasons
ablerates. Thepointwasbrought
out that such an establishment
would be especially valuable to
students. This is undoubtedly
true. Student habits and life are
eminently proper and picturesque
for a state of health; but for the
sickstudent, not at all. Boxedup
in one room with a room mate. the
sick long for the home to which
they are accustomed. are burden;
some to their room mate, who
hasn'tagreatdealoftimeto spare,
and often to the whole house.
They know this well, but are help-
less; their r'rleals must be brought
them and other things done at con-
siderable bothcr, which at home
would cause much less trouble.

Underthese circumstancesahos~
pital would be a boon to the stus
dent. But as before hintcd, the
cost must necessarily be propor
tional to the average income of a
student. Grilmell is a very proe
gressive town. When her people
work out a new achievement, they
do so thoroughly. They may see
ﬁt to postpone the building of a
hospital for some time, but only
until the way is clear for carrying
out the plan to a successful realiza-
tion.

history of Iowa College is schc-
dulcd totake place next Friday
evening in the men's gymnasium.
The visiting contestant will be a
team from the State University,
Both teams have had the advans
tage of participating in public ex—
hibitions, where, according to re-
ports from the thczzclecpomy
concerning their athletes and from
observations on our own, good
pertormances were given.

The apparatus will be the same
as was used in the exhibition, with
one exception. The giant swing
on the horizontal bar was not are
tempted by any one at that time.
But next Friday night it will be a
most interesting and exciting
event, in which only two will come
pets. The giant swing is about

 

the last thinglearned on thesingle
bar. l

The team representing the State
University will be composed of
the following: R. G Coll, ’02, G.
'C. Wise, ’01, Elk. Rule, ’02, C. P.
Schenk, '04 W. I. Cameron, 'or,
J, A. Friilgl ’OI. Grinnell'steam

among the tollowing: Heald,’04,
Marsh, acad, Chase, ‘02, Walleser,
'03, Farks,‘o3, Burnside,’o4, Blaths
erwiclt,’or,Mitchell,’o4. Attention
is called to our‘colnparisoni Near—
ly all of S. U. I,’s team is chosen
from Seniors' and juniors while
the larger part of the Grinnell
candidates are from the classes
below Junior ranle ltisthesame
old story over again—tor some
inexplicablereason Grinnell teams
are most often made up of very
young athletes, thoughinthis par-
ticular case the cause is immedi-
ately found in the lack of oppor-
tunities before the erection of the
present gym.

First, second and third places
will be given ﬁve, three and one
points respectively, the system
being the same as that of a track
dual, Two expert judges have
been secured: Carl Rothfuss of

Des Moines and W. } Monilaw
DfDrake. An alternative judge
will be chosen from Grinnell, '
whose vote will only be used in
case of a tie between the ﬁrst two
mentioned.

The contest will begin prompt-
ly at eight o’clocle Ample ar-
rangements will be made for the
convenience of the spectators,

Another Dissipation of the
Senior Club.

The Senior Club was entertain»
cd Saturday evening by the ladies

skill of those present was tried to
the utmost by pictures. covering

ing certain ﬂowers, pictures of
many subjects, shocs. McKinlcy's.
small boys, large dudes and even
photographs whose originals were
highly suggestive of “sweet” old
fashioned flowers. A bouquet of‘
Carnations was awarded Katherine
Henderson for guessing correctly
the largest number. Miss Rew
gave several selections onthc vio»
lin, which were among the most
pleasant features of the evening.
A dainty luncheon followed. Mrs.
Allen Johnson.Mrs.W.C.Wyckoi—f,
Miss Millerd, Miss Raymond and

the club.
