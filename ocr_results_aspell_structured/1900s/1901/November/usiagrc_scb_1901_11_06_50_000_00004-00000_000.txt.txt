What occurred between the
halves no one bill Coach Tratt and
the team knows, but when Captain
Fisk lined his men up lor the sec-
ond kick-off. there ivas a spirit ot
determination manitest among
them. which bodcd nogood for tlle
Amcs teamt Pcr'haps it was in-
spired by the burning ot the larva
College colors by irresponsible
parties during the intermission.
perhaps by the traditions of the
game with Ames iii '97. just lorri
years ago Saturday. At any rate

from the moment that Marsh’s ‘,

arms encircled the ball on the kicks
off and he had \vliggled anti
wormed his way (or 20 yards
throughtheAmeselevcn.the\vhole
team seemed to have taken a new
lease on lite. By lille bucks and
end runs Grinnell carried the
hall down the ﬁeld. The Antes
men were resisting doggedly. brit
Grinnell was not to be denied and
Collins was soon shoved over tor
the ﬁrst touch-down. Fisk kicked
a difﬁcult goal.

Gloom possessed the“lnvincible
Order of Chronic Rooters.”

From now on the Ames team,
tired and discouraged, seemed to
give up all hope and the toolball
game was changed into a game of
tag. Now Captain Fisk would
reel on 15 or 20 yards on adouble
pass while the Ames lines slept
serenely; now Lyman. who at the
beginning ot the second half
had replaced Evan Evans at right
half. electriﬁed the crowd by gal-
loping through the whole Ames
eleven for 60 yards and a touch
down. once Fisk. jtlst to vary
the monotony. decided to try a
scale by the air-line. and while the
Crowd held its breath the ball
sailed from theoOryard line squares
1y between the goal posts.

Not content with a score of r7

 

to 0, Moore seized the ball on a

Ames men and bounced into‘tllc

r, After going 30 yards north
like a cannon ball, he stopped iinr
der the Arnes goal posts and Fisk
completed the 23 points by kicltr
ing an easy goal.

The game ended with the ball
in Griniiell's possession on Ames'
3o»yard line with the prospect of
another touch-down for Grinnell
in the near future.
