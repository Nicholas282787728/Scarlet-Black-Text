SIMPSON'S HOPES DASHED.
(COIHlilllCd llom F st Page)
was a repetition of the ﬁrst
Grinnell carried the ball and
Simpson played on the detensive.
The predictions made by the lat»
ter's rooters concetning the sec-
oncl llalf failed tocotne true and an»
other touch down was made and
goal kicked 6 minutes- atter the
whistle blew for the kick-off. The
visitors were simply outclassed.
Anothcr series ot two to lo yard
gains by Griilnell, and Collins
through left tackle and
sprinted twenty yards [or a touch
down. Fisk sent the ball between
the posts, Simpson kicked ot'r lo
the 10 yard line and the hall was
worked hack to the middle of tlie
ﬁcltl and Fisk attempted a pii’tce
kick from the 45 yd, line but the
hall fell short. Duiing the stlcs
ceeoing plays Simpson had the
ball in her possession twice but
was immediately forced to piint.
Grinnell tllcn executed
brilliant end runs and ﬁerce line
smashes and pushed the ball over
to. the ﬁnal touchdown and goal,
Artei a few exchanges of compli—
ments in printing, time was called
with the ball in Grinnell's posses»
sion oil the 25 yard line. Final
score. Grinnell 3;. Simpson 0.
The entire game was a splendid
tribute to the work of Coach Tratt
sud Trainer Watson. Simpson‘s

want

some

physical condition was iai- trom
being as good as Grinllell's,

After the game Coach Grifﬁth
said: "Our tellotvs was over-
conﬁdent. Grinnell clearly out-
classed them and she won tairly
all she got."

Coach Trait stated: ”Grinnell
has improved some since the
Arms game. Simpson was not
so strong as was expected,"

Coach Ktllpe or Iowa was an
interested spectator and Exptessed

himself as follows: “Gl'innell

,siniih

 

Scarlet anb‘jJBlaclt

played a strong, fast, consistent
game throughout and earned all
she got. I'm going back to work
up some points I learned from the
game, Gi-innell is much stronger
than chpcctedto ﬁnd her. ‘l‘ratt
is good on developing interter-
elice,”
