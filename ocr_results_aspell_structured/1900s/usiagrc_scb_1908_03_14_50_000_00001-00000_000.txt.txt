Geo. W. Patterson tollowed tor the

nrgatii-e. The argument he prcseutcd

it every case shows how hard follgllthils that the Fiitoenth amendment

should not be repealed because it pros
tects the negro.

Frederick Murphy was the third
Grinnell sneaker. He contended that
the amendment usurped a state time-
tion: that it could not be eiiiorced,
and that repeal would he a positive
benefit, The case presented was very
strong and seemed to be conclusive.

c. W. Okey closed the debate with
a speech in‘which he contended that
the Fitteenth amendment is solving
the race problem and hence has bccn
a positive benefit to the south.

in rebuttal, every man spoke well
it is a
dtiiicult matter to say which man gave
the best rebuttal speech. D. E. Camp:

periority at basketball, and incident-

mentioned championship of seven

states, except for a defeat at the hands
ot‘ Simpson, which seems almost in—
conceit-able.

The game was not, perhaps, the best
of the year, but the unusually large
crowd of some six hundred people
who saw the game and the immense
amount of enthusiasm which was kept
up by the Rooters Association and the
Windsor Club on opposite sides of the
field, tended to make it a memorable
one,
