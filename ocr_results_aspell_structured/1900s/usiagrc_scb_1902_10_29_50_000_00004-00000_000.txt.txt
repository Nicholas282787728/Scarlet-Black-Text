Grinnell had the niisfonnne to
fumble at very critical places, in
this way losing practically two
touch-clowns

The Giiiinell learn outrweighEEI
the Waterloo boys and this, with
probably superior training. told
in the second halt The game
was doubly interesting in the fact
tltat it was Coached by an Iowa
College man, Evan s. Evans, of
last yeai‘s 'Varsity. It has by far
the best high school game played

played the game to the ﬁnish and
were not defeated because they
lacked nerve or quichne, .

Next Saturday Grinnell goes to
Des Moines to play East Des
