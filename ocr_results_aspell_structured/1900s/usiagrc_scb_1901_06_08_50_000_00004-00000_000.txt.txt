Seniors Breakfast on Campus.

In response to invitations sent
out the fore part of the week, by
the so called Seniorooys club, the
existence of which is more or less
spasmodic, the members of the
Senior class congregated on the
south campus Friday morning at
7:30 to enjoy a class breakfast.

This occasion was also the
tint appearance of the caps and
gowns to be worn during Com»
mencemcnt. Immediately after
the arrival they were sealed at
three tables piettily decorated
with ﬂowers, That the breakfast
was heartily enjoyed was evillccd
by the way it was partaken oi,
From a tent pitched near by the
breakfast was brought forth by
members of tthunicr class who
proved themselves efﬁcient wait-
ers. After breakfast the class
was ushered to chapel by Miss
Meyer and Mr. Nollen. Among
the many social features of the
week this stands out as one of the
best and the Senior boys proved
themselves to be royal entertain-
ers.

The ”Cyclone".

As was anticipated the Junior
Annual proved a success. The
only criticism passed upon it is in
regard to the cartoons which are
not of the highest grade. But
the solid matter of the book and
the engravings are excellent. It
was a success ﬁnancially, as well,
and the board isto be congratu-
lated upon the results of their
labor. The amount realized from
the sale of the books, the adver-
tising, which amounted to 5300.
was 5786. The total cxpeilse was
5776, thus leaving a surplus often
dollars.
