tions the opening chapel exercises

ni Hall will be obliged to accommo-
date the increasing number of stu-
dents lot a levy weeks yet, though the
attendance this morning was beyond
its seating capacity.

iully led the ﬁrstexercisesot the year
and impressed old students as well as
new with the joy and honor oi mem»
bership in Iowa College A remark
about Griunell's perennial damp spell
was preliminary to a few serious words
about the spi t and seli-reliance
which makes the world tor a college
student, We are here primarily ior
work. This work is made up of three
elements, the instructor, the material
worked over, and ourselves, The lat-
ter is the greatest factor and the one
which is under- our immediate control
and direction: Tire material, like all
the world, is old. but we are ever tiew.
arid by putting ou‘rselres into the work
we make it. new also. Analysis and
study are the things which bring out
the hidden and undiscovered elements
in old subiects it is tor us to make
iot- oirrselres a new world iroin old
material To dothisthere is put under
our care power and inthtence. \tht

and improvements in their faculties.
Tire equipment at Iowa City has been
enlarged and a. great eﬁurti is being
made to bring the institution up to
the high standards set tor in A new
Conservatory or Music is one or the
principal additions. Highland Park’s
many departmentsare attracting large
numbers of short course students and
the State Normal at Cedar Fall is

The Smaller schools of the state
show aremarkable improvement and
increase. There is a large number of
them and the enthusiastic support
which they obtain is signiﬁcant or

Smaller number oicllallges than usual
in its teaching corps. There is but
one new proiessor in the College and
only three instructors and assistants.
The School of Music witnesses the
greatest change, Mr. SmiLh alone 1'2-
mainlng of its lasbyear’s faculty. In
the academy there are two new in-
strlictors, while a new dean of Wm
men and ﬂ new matron of the ladies’
cottage complete the number of
changes

The organ work of the college and
church wlll be handled byMrl Edward
Scheve, late of Lhe First Baptist
church 01 Chicago. The Outlook {or a
work Wider and oi greater signiﬁcance
than ever before will be the result of ,
of Mr. Sclieve’s coming to Grinnell, a
fact more certain on account of the
good fortune which comes Wit-h the
installment of the new organ in the
Congregational church, an instrument
or special design and value and doubt-
less tlle best in the state. Mr. Sehere
Obtained his early education in Ger»
