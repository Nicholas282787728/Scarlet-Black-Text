ment made in our ﬁrst issue,
sample copies or the ﬁrst three is-
sues ot SCARLET AND BLACK were
sent to all in the college so far as
the addresses could be secured.
This issue will be delivered only
to those who have intimated their
desire to subscribe for the year.
The number of those who have so
intimated is not what lt should be.
Upon all others we wish to urge
the claims or the college paper.
It ought to be true that the main
support of the college paper
should be the local support. but
so far as SCARLET AND BLACK is
‘Concerned this has never been so.
The alumni subscription has ale
ways been largcr than the student
subscription, and were it not for
outside iricnds the paper would
be seriously crippled. We submit
to the students whether this is as
it should be. As one of the stur
dent enterprises, the college paper
should receive the same loyal sup-
port that is granted to the others,
Only in this way can it keep pace
with those of other institutions,
and successfully meet the con-
stantly increasing demands placed
upon it.

ERTAIN improvements in
Ward Field are very much
needed, and it is to be hoped that
those who have the care of the
ﬁeld will delay no longer in mak
ing them. It surely is clear to all
that the high grass and the great
unevenness ot the ground, due to
the removal oi the track, cause an
unnecessary risk to be run by
those who are training tor the
team. It might easily happen

that the best man in the team
would be laid up for the season
because of some one’s failure to
get the ﬁeld in decent condition.
At that price such carelessness
would be very costly. The most
advisable thing would be to put a
force at work, immediately, to
make the ﬁeld ﬁt for the daily
practice. A criticism of a similar
nature might be made with regard
to the new track. With the hand-
icap meet only ten days off, and
the track in its present condition,
it hardly seems possible that good

results can be accomplished.

his the hope ot the tootball
management that a large number
of students will attend the Ames-
Grinnell game at Marshalltown

been secured from the Iowa Cen-

Grinnell at o a. m.. and leave
Marshalltown at io:oo p. m. This
