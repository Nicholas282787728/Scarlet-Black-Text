STATE MEET A PUZZLE.

Winner at the Greatbay is Hard to Pick
wNormal Liltcty to Figure
Conspicuotrsty.

At about nine o’clock on the
of Saturday next, the
Iowa Cr ty and Gtintlell special
will pass through this city bound
for the stale ﬁeld meet. Low
rates are promised and a large
Grinnell delegation assured and
the pt- ect tor a day nl exciter
ment is all that could he wished
it uncertainty can furnish it.

No one knows who will'witl the
meet. Normal and Cot: giving
every evidence ot being able to
cut in on the big schools. Drake
smashing all kinds ot records in
practice. Ames showing up much
stronger than a year ago and Iowa
givtng Minnesota all that the
Gophers could handle is enough
to cause trainers worry and ath-
letes to lose much sleep. The
records made at the meet at Cedar
Rapids yesterday in the track
union meet were good enough to
win at the state meet in some cases
and ttiere will probably be some.
thing startling lrom Normal and
Coe at the state meet.

For the ﬁrst time in years Gtin-
netl has protluctzd a neight man,
Green is name and he has
beaten tlte state record the
shot putt It Green does as
at the state meet he wrll rob Iotvtt
ot ﬁve points which the old gold
has been counting on throughout
tlte spring. Cratre,the Iowa man,
has been reckoned a sure
in the event.

Chester Main at Drake ltas been
doing wonderful work in the
sprints and hurdles, especially the
220 hurdles, Several times this
spring he has tied the record in
the low hurdles and Dr. Monilaw
expects htm to break it ere the
season is over. In the hundred
and 220 hi: has been running mar.
velously last doing the former in
g 4 5 second in practice, But the
record can hardly be considered
bettertllatt :to ﬂat when the con
ditionsarc considered. A very
heavy wind was blowing on his
back when he did it, Butin Hamli-
ton of Normal Main scemslohave
his match. The Normal runner
made the distance in :to tiat in
the dual meet with Coe and seems
to be good for something even
faster. Ten seconds will win the
event at the state meet unless
Main brcaks loose again. If Ham-
ilton should win. and his chances
seem tznnd. Drake will be knocked
out of ﬁve points materiallv de-
creasing: her c ha n c e 5. So on
throught the list of event it can
be seen where some of the bigger
scho o | s will I so points to the
smaller, at condi on which will
make the result uncertain until
the very end.

DEAN MAIN’S CHAPEL TALK.

Dean Main has bccn present as
Grinnell's representative at the
National Convention of the Y. M.
C. A. at Buffalo, NI Y., and at the
request otthe students gave in
chapel last Friday a short talk on
what was accomplished there.
The principle reason tor Profes—
sor Main’s trip was to of‘fcr Grin—
nell as the most advantageous
place in Iowa for holding the
summer conference, which has
formerly been situated athneva,
Wtsconsin. The reason for
change is mainly the nonrccntral
position of Geneva tor such a
universal gathering. Further it
lacks the permanent and well ap.
pointed buildings such as gymna-
siutns and assembly halls which
such a conference demands. All
these material advantages, and
also the spiritual atmosphere
which is needed, Gritltlell pos-
The chances for such a
change is very tavorable and it is
to be urged upon the students
and triends of Iowa College to
proclaim the ﬁtness of Griirnell,
in every possible nay.

One or the deepest impressions
which Dean lltarh carried away
from Buffalo was that of the true
brotherhood which existed be-
tween the delegates. It is a
spirit peculiar to these later years
and is ever exerting a more pt-
found influence in both the relig-
ious and political worlds. It is
to be the unique tnoveme nt of the
twentieth century.

The convention was interesting,
too, for the spirit of equality oi
man to man, which pervaded alt
its deliberations. Rich and poor,
high and low all continued their
efforts for the common good.

The present time is important
to us because it marksa change
of the public attitude towards re»
ligion. The relation b e t iv e en
business and religion is very
close. And especially is this true
in regard to the Yountz Men's
Christian Association The prac-*
tical work which the association
now does in providing homes for
the vast army ot railroad employ.
cos, of maintaining schools tor the
boys,of making good citizens out
ofall men, marks an important
epoch in the history of the world.
