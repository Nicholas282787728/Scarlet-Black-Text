with the plucky Coe team on their own
grounds.

ways a rather stiff proposition. Every

Grinnell today and repeat the per-torm-
ance or three years ago, when they
defeated Crinnell s to e on Ward
field However, in five games played
this 'is the only deieat registered
against Grinnell.

Certainly Crinneil is not in the best
at shape and continued changes in the
lineup has made team work impossible.
The injury ot Shinstrom in the first
part of the week has left quite a hole
in the backﬁeld, which is being tilled
hy l-Ieldt, who will probably start the
Coe game at halt.

Coach Dougerty has put the men
through a hard scrimmage every night
this week and the poor tackling and
inexcusable Ininhiing displayed in the
Ames game has been considerably tar
proved. They ran over the Freshman
teanl almost at will in practice Thurs

that there is a last dit'ierencc bctileeu

with it. "The places reserved in the
world are not tor those who kiiow a
great tlcal, hilt tor those who can do
something." The speaker stated it as
his conviction that any man or woman
in C 'nncll College could, by devoting
ten years to a religious ettort to inas-
tcr soiile one thing, command a salary
of $5,000 a year.

But this nbili . to do something was
not held up as the only object at an
education. This is merely to be the
inundation on which to rear a super-

so great as to discourage him. We
