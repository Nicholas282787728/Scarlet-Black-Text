A LETTER FROM MRS, BRADLEY.

My Dear Friends: ioii ish mo to

Everywhere this is n husr worm,
but there is ‘4. wide diner-once ht

Naturally our ivorh center‘s iii i'lile

Through the open door pours ti cone

nesium classes nro nlwrtys iull. The
sewing school with its two hundred
girls, the orchestre and mandolin
clubs, and the Recreation Room loi
hays, the Mothers' Club and Women's
societies, together with the choir nnd
some seventy Sunday School teauuels
are n few or the things which olnim
our attention.

Frequent calls to servrcc come troui
all pitrts of Lhe city. A talk to a eir-
cle at King's Daughters, or other comr
panies of women; n ivord ol encour-
agement to church or mission, or an
evening to he spent in some sociol
settlement, is the wa) a part 01 our
time is spent.

A never ceasing activity, put it
brings greet joy to he ehle to help in
some smell wey, where there is need.

It is not all wor however. There
are delighu'ul hours spent with men

uplifting uttei-ences of giitetl spenh-
ers give the reliet irom ciire which

We may wish tor our deer student
triends nothing better than that they
may, sometime, be permitted to here
a part in this glorious service.

With loving rememhrance,
