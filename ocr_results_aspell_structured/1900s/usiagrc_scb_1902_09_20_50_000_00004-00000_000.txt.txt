DEATH OF MRS WHITCOMB.

Just after the commencemznt

whole College and community were
shocked and saddened by the an.
nouncement of the death of Mrs.

more sad because it came so suds
denly and unexpectedly.

Mrs. Whitcomb had a charming
personality and a sweet disposi»
tion which gained for her a very
large number of admiring friends.
She lvas a student at Iowa College,
graduating with the class of ‘97.
Her marriage to Mr. Wllitconlb
occurred in 1899, since which time
they havelivcd in Grinnell.

Mrs. Whitcomb possessed abcau-
tiful voice, and her kind generosity
rendered her music all the more

The sympathy of the

whole school is with Mr. Wllirr

comb in his bereavement.

DEATH OF MR. AND MRS.
MOODY'S CHILD.

One or the saddest happenings
of the opening ofthe college year
was the death of the infant son of
Mr. and Mrs. Levi Moody on last
Sunday inorning,aged two months.
The funeral was conducted by
Rev. E. M. Vittum at the house.
Music was furnished by a mixed
quartet c o m p use d of Misses

kinson and Mr. Morrison. The re-
rnains were taken to Agency for
