Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson: only one clear winner

Personally, last week was one of the most riveting weeks
of the year Why? Because it was Masters week,

The Masters is iiiguiibly the most important single [our
nament of rhe year on the PGA Tour, and certainly the
most presrigions. it is held at Augusrn National GolfClllb,
where every hole on the course is named after a flower. lr is
a four day rournninenr from Thursday to Sunday with non-
competition events earlier in die week, and above all, rhe
winner receives his own lifetime membership to Augusta,
exemplified by a green jacket presented at the end of the
tournament.

The Masters is also the first of the four major champir
onships held every season which along with the us. Open,
the British open and the PGA Championship, constitute
the Grand Slam ofGolf, Of the four, the Masters seems to
be the most difficult one to win. Winning a single Masters
can deﬁne a professional golfer's career. This year's tournn'
ment is especially important, not just for golf, but for the
entire sports world as well.

Tiger Woods ﬁnally emerged from his fortress of soli-
tude to join the party at Augusta. Behind his dark shades,
he clearly demonstrated that his game was still sharp, yet
still came short of his goal of victory. The buzz was on
Woods for five days before Phil Mickelson decided to write
a different storyline. On Saturday, Mickelson almost made
three eagles in a row on the back nine to move into second
heading into the ﬁnal day. on sunday, Mickelson lived up
to his reputation ofgoing for the high-risk shots on his way
to victory on the back nine. l—lis oriron that he hit 207 yards
off of pine needles to four feet on the par five, 13th hole,
was nothing short ofspectaculariundoubtedly the shot of
the tournament, maybe the year. In other words and less
numbers, an emotionally charged Phil Mickelson was bril-
liant. These two men at: the top two golfers in the world,
but their personal lives couldn't be any farther apart on the
spectrum.

The Masters was Woods’ ﬁrst tournament this year, res
turning from a self-imposed hiatus following his Thanks-
giving cat accidcnt last November, the incident that ul-
timately revealed his multiple extrarmartial affairs and
sparked scandal. Last February, Woods gave a very scripted
‘press conference" where he profusely apologized for his in
ﬁdelity and hinted that he may not return to competitive
golfthis year. In January jack Nicklaus (whose record of18
major championships is Woods’ goal) essentially said in an
interview that Woods could not sit out this year ifhe wants

to catch his record,

Last Monday, in his ﬁrst unscripted press conference
since rhc Thanksgiving car accident, Woods rold reports
els that he started hitting bitlls five weeks ago: “And than
I started hitting more balls ilnd more balls. And I started
getting the itch again to srarr pluyingngilln."

During the same press conference, Woods claimed rhar
the reason he did not play earlier rhis year was because he
was not physically ready to play and compere on a high level
until now. Pcrsonally,l don't believe him.

The Masters is a special tournament not only for it its
significance, bur for its prominence as well. By now, the
whole week has become, essentially, a very controlled event.
At the Masters, golf fans in at-
rendance are identified as “pa-
trons" and are knowledgeable of
the game. it is the only major
championship where the phor
tographers and reporters of the
associated press are not allowed
inside the ropes at any point in
the event. Essentially, the orga-
nizers of the Masters make their
best attempt each year to make the tournament as “pure'
as possible by placing careful attention to the game ofgolf.
This frne attention to the game includes being highly sensi-
tive to every player's nccd. Aside from it being one of the
four majors, it is because the Masters is so controlled that
Tiger Woods decided to make his return to competitive

olf.

g I think Woods could have returned three weeks ago at
Arnold Palmer's tournament on the PGA Tour, the Arnold
Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill (for those ofyou unfamiliar,
Arnold Palmer, along with Jack Nicklaus, is one ofthe leg-
ends of golf, not just a drink you can mix with alcohol). it
is a tournament where Woods does what he does best—win
in dramatic style.

i believe that Woods was fully ready to play two weeks
ago at Arnold’s tournament, but chose not to in fear of the
public's reaction, Like most other PGA Tour events, the
Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill is an event open
to all golf fans~not just the demure “patrons"—Wl10 can
shout and heckle all they want. Arnold's tournament also
is open to more media outlets and paparazzi than the con-
trolled Masters tournament. Thc reason Woods did not
come back sooner is because he didn't want to face all those

people—nor because his game wasn’t ready.

The Masters lirondes Woods the ideal theater and idcnl
audience ro rernrn his name to the sporrs pages, nor the
tabloids. It appears ro be a very calculated decision ro come
back at the Masters, bur in my opinion, it is the wrong
dcclsion.l believe Woods should have returned two weeks
earlier at Arnold’s tournament because it would have shown
good character on the pait ofwoods. it would have given
him a chance ro face up to the public.

No one condoncs VVoods' infidelity, that’s for sure. But
as a golf fan, all I want is to see him play golf at the highest
level of competition. I believe he could have been comper-
ing two weeks ago to the delight of fans, but instead he
chose to come back this week to
the comfort ofthe hyper security
that the Masters organization
can provide and to the delight of
golf"patrons".

But despite all of the pro»
vided comfort,Woods still didn't
win the Masters. He hasn't won
it since 2005, plagued with put—
ting woes each year. No, Woods
didn’t win. Mickelson did. And what a great win it was.
An exhibition of exemplary shotrmak‘ing over the weekend
earned Mickelson his third green jacket, and 38th victory
on the PGA Tour. But more importantly, Mickelson’s story
is as inspiring as Woods' is frustrating.

Last year, Mickelson’s mother and wife were both diag—
nosed with breast cancer. His family has not been able to
travel with him to tournaments since May. That is, up until
last week when the family rented a house for the duration of
the tournament. on Sunday, Mickelson’s wife Amy stayed
at the house to watch the tournament unfold on television.
But when it looked like Mickelson had it locked up, Amy,
along with family and friends, went to the 18th green, the
last hole of the Tournament. After making one more birdie
and securing victory, Mickelson was surprised to see his
wife as he walked off of the green, and the two embraced
without saying a wordiDisneyastylc.

Woods' and Mickelson’s personal lives couldn't be any
more different, but they are still at the top oftheir sport. I
hope Woods keeps playing on the PGA Tour to win back
some dignity. And as for Mickelson, I wish him rhe best.

Kramer explains allure of baseball and golf

Ah, spring. The air is warm, the grass is fresh, the trees
are newly green and the squirrels are less standoffish.Yes, it’s
a wonderful time—especially for sports fans,who are treated
to several entertaining spectacles. This month is for many
athletics enthusiasts what a “Detigmrlg Miner." marathon is
to your divorced great—aunt—whar shark week is for Tracy
Morganiwhat panda porn is for pandas. In college, we get
the championship tournaments of men's and women’s bas—
ketball and men’s hockey, 1n the professional realm. we get
the Masters Tournament, MLB opening Day, the NFL draft
and the start of both NBA and NHL playoffs. But 1 ap
proach April's sporring smorgasbord skeptically. sure,
these events have a lot of fans. but I fear I will derive
less enjoyment from this month. See, I’m willfully
oblivious to professional baseball and, apologies to
fellow SGB Sports columnist and rice golfer Kunal
Bansal, but I would sooner watch grapes turn into
raisins/a Major League Soccer (MLS) game-than
professional golf

I'll begin wirh why I don’t care a lick about the
start of ”America's Pasrime," Major League Base-
ball (MLB). The number one reason, of course, is
steroids. Performance-enhancing substances have
tainted this entire era of baseball. The greats
esr players of our generation like Alex Rodrir
guez, Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa, Barry
Bonds, Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz, Gary
Sheffield, Roger Clemens, etc. have been
implicated in steroid use. At this point, if
Albert Pujols or Derek Jerer is exposed as
a user, the sport loses all credibility. There’s a part of me
that loves the offense-driven play of the Steroid Era, but I
can't see records like Babe Ruth’s and Hank Aaron's broken
by cheaters. Besides, it's a slippery slope from sreroid use to
more outlandish performance enhancements like, say, bionr
ics. And nobody wants a bunch of buff, ill—tempered robots
out there capable of taking control of our major cities. so

Kramer’s Rules

unlike Lil Wayne, I do not support allowing all substances
into baseball.

My other grievances wirh MLB are more ﬁxable. I’m
originally from Kansas City, so I'm a Royals fan, In recent
history, this has meant that baseball has nothing to offer me.
1 needn’t pay any attention because the Royals will ineVltaa
bly come in last in their division and near last in the league
(if they don't set a record for losses in a season). American
League cy Young Award Winner zack Greinke has gotten
my attention, but last year the Royals faded like it was their

job after a great start. It would b: one thing ifthe
Royals were terrible because they were misman-
aged, bur I blame most of the Royals’woes on
their inability to keep the talent they scout
and draft because of baseball's lack of a
salary cap. Teams from small markets like
Kansas city simply don'r make rhc revenue
from TV and marketing that teams from
New York, Boston, and Los Angeles. So
while there are some smallamarket success
stories—the Devil Rays, Tigers, and Car
dinals, come to mind—such teams are holor
graphic Charizards amongst the multitude of
Energy card Yankees or BoSox rhar buy the
best roster.

The reasons I’m not a golrfan are
very different. I like watching base-
ball, I just don't feel like the MLB
has integrity as a league. In contrast,
I take about as much sporting inter
est in golf as I do in ﬂnli w: Reads/7m). I don’t like watch-
ing golf and could care ess about its integrity issues, all
which seem to take place away from the course in places like
nightclubs frequented by Tiger Woods,Tiger Woods’ house,
restaurants Tiger Woods are at or Tiger Woods’ car. Before
last weekend, I had never watched more than five minutes
of televised golf, and i have played the game just a handful

of times, miniature golf excluded. I changed that last Suns
day, watching the final round of the Masters online all day
and occasionally looking at my homework for stretches of
up to five or 10 seconds at a time. I didn't hate it, but I
didn't really enjoy ir either, I couldn’t get over the overly pre-
cious reverence of the TV commentary, for one thing. This
sort or thing was pretty standard: ‘A picture, indeed a thou—
sand words...The Masters,‘ ‘A fist-pump from Westwood, a'
fistrpump from Mickelsonl’ and ‘Oncc more, with feeling,
Mickelson wins The Masters.'At times the commentators’
bon mots were reminiscent ofa certain loquaeious, vaguely
British orfrCampus study Director.

1 did see why some people obsess over televised golf,
however. I understood why every single person in the crowd
was positively grinning the whole time and exuberantly hole
lering “Phil!” after a good drive—rho sport has some drama.
The last few holes of the final round between Mickelson
and Lee Wesrwood were genuine, edge-of-your-seat excites
ment, even though the Philrharmonic’s lead was never less
than two strokes. Golf also has plenty ofvisual appeal, espe-
cially when it takes place at sunset on a course as beautiful
as Augusta National. Each shot carried its own modicum
of suspense, but even in the most prestigious tournament
in golf, I frequently found myself checking out the ridicur
lous clothing on the grinning white people who comprised
rhe crowd (pastel polos and sun hats). But there's too much
down-time in the broadcast. too much time watching Phil
line up a shot, then his caddy line up the shot, then Phil
line it up again, then Phil pracrice swing eight times before
missing the putt and doing it all again.

That’s whyI want to play, rather than watch, more golfi
all the fun, less waiting and much less stringent scoring,
Who knows, with Kunal's help maybe someday a golf an-
nouncer will shout, "And a ﬁsrrpurnp from McLuckial Truly
a thousand words!" Unless they put LilWayne in charge and
I have to compete with the cyborgs.
