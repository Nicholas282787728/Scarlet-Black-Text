Resistance in the face of invasion

‘ Second of two articles by Nick
McNamara

“If the United States invades,‘

bombs. sends combat troops. or
otherwise signiﬁcantly escalates
in intervention in Nicaragua or El
Salvador, thousands of US.
citizens are promising massive
public resistance." So said
Yvonne Dilling, national COOP
dinator oi ‘Witness for Peace’, in a
speech last Saturday in Des
Moines at a meeting oi the in 'u
Committee to Stop the Wu ' Ceil-
trul America.

The iowa committee is part oi a
national movement of religious
and peace groups which has an»
nounced a “pledge oi resistance"
as the contingency plan in the
event of a US. invasion in Central
America. “Our purpose,” says So-
journers editor Jim Wallis, “is to
prevent such an invasion or to
make such a policy so domestical-
ly costly that it will have to be
abandoned." Wallis adds that by
taking up nonviolent direct action
on the largest scale possible. “we
hope to bring the issue heiore the
American people. pressure Cone
gress to act, and demand an imr

mediate withdrawal or us iorces
irom Central America.”

in the event oi any us. military
escalation in Nicaragua or El
Salvador, the following will hap-
pen:

1) A signal irom the national
committee will go out to regional.
state. and local contactpeoplc and
groups

2i People across the country
will gather at a previously
designated location tat least one
in every congressional district.)
These community centers or churr
ches will be the gathering points
ior receiving and sharing inior-
mation. ior prayer and mutual
support, for preparing and com-
missioning one another [or action

3) A nonviolent vigil will be
established at the congressional
lield oiiices oi each us. senator
and representative. Each office
will be peaceiully occupied until
the congressperson votes to end
the invasion

Letters to the editor

call for
campus vote

To the editor:

As a concerned Constituent of
the Grinliell student body, 1 would
like to express my concern with
the way SGA is representing inc

Recently, SGA voted on a mo
[ton to add its name to a list of
schools that Comprised the Slur
dent Leadership Project. and to
endorse its proposal expressing
concern the SLP had with present
u.s. policy toward, Central
America, My quarrel is not with
the proposal. but with the way
SGA handled the issue

After two lengthy meetings.
SGA voted on the issue, and it fails
ed. Along the way, motions were
made to decide it it was an impor-
tant question, which means it
needed a 2/3 majority to pass
(that passed). whether it should
be put to a referendum (that fall-
ed). whether certain amendments
should be made (that failedl, and
finally. the issue itself. After watr
thing these two meetings, l've
come to the conclusion that SGA
either doesn't know. or doesn't
really care what the opinion or the
student body it represents is.

For example. one represene
tatlve. speaking against sending
the issue to referendum. said in ef-
f ect the student body was ignorant
of the issue and didn't really care.
so a referendum was a futile
move. At. the time this statement
was made. this might have been
true. but this was due to the fact
that the people responsible for br-
inging the issue to the lore didn't
do an adequate job. Once the issue
was publicized. such as in the
S&B. and ball presidents did begin
to talk to their constituents. and
people on campus did begin to talk
about it, and entirely ditlei'ent
picture developed. From conve
rsation in the dining halls, in the
forum. and all around campus. it
became obvious that the students
were taking an ‘ interest, were
bothering to get themselves
educated. and were taking a stand
on the issue. The reason the
referendum motion failed wasn't
because SGA felt itwas capableof
making the correct decision. but
because certain elementsbf SGA

' were alraid it would pass i! put .

before the predominantly liberal
student body,

As an example on the other side.
amendments were proposed at the
second meeting. to be voted on
that evening. ithout giving the
student body any chance whale
soevel' to look over the proposal
and make a deuswll. 'l‘hc amend
nieiits were rejected. but not
because the students vlcl'L-li’l
given the opportunity to look at
the amendments. but because cerr
lain elements didn't feel the ncn
proposal met their ideological
standards.

No matter what side was take
on the above questions, thc essc
tial point I‘m trying to make is
that the students in general were
left out in the cold. For the
members of SGA to feel that the
Grinnell student body is 't able to
make an educated decision is both
selling short the intelligence of 'a
very capable student body, and ig-
noring the atmosphere of political
thought and activity this student
body prides itseli on.

The point of this letter is to bl»
ing back the issue or campus lite
referendums to deCide the stance
taken by Grinnell on political
issues. A reiendum would bring
back into play the student body
which seems to be ignored by SGA
up to this point It is true that Matt
Golden was elected on a platform
of increased political activity. and
as far as I'm. concerned he is do-
ing a good job. it is naive to
believe that thﬁe hail presidents
were elected on a similar plat
iorm. Even it they were, over 1/4
of the student body, the freshman
class, is going unrepresented. or
at least didn't have a say in the
present makup oi SGA. and from
what I’ve seen and heard. they are
concerned with the issues brought
before SGA.

In conclusion, 1 would like to
state the belief tha referendums
should be used to determine the
political stance taken by the (x
nell student body. for whether it
represents us directly or not, lhe
outside world will read Grinnell
SGA to mean at least “the Grin»
nell student body", ii not just
“Grinnell College“. There is not
doubt in my mind that a substan-
tial number, if not a majority of
the students on this campus are
politically aware and concerned
enough that given the information
on an issue and the time to discuss
it ireely and openly and in

ieiligenily. iioud be able lo niakc

ripped”

TO the Editor:

On November 21, l was arrested
in Des Moines ior tearing up a
llustlcr magazine and rciusing to
pay ior it. Four others were are
rested with me. The charges were
later dropped. We were protesting
violent pornography. but we
weren’t advocating censorship,
id like to explain.

1 ripped up that tiustier because
I object to the images of women
portrayed in the magazine. For-
nography such as the type that
Larry Flynt produces repeats
strongly and consistently
messages that are simply lies;
women enjoy being abused.
harassed, and raped, it’s fun to
have sex with children. and
violence is normal. I feel that
these magazines are libelous. in
many porn magazines. books. and
movies, women who are being
raped are shown in the throes oi
orgasm. i believe that these works
are a violation of my civil rights.
They lie about women as a group.
This 37 billion a year industry is.
as Susan Brownmiller says. “antic
iemale propaganda."

Have you ever looked at a
Hustler? Please do. You see, i
want everyone to look at this por-
nography and see it ior what it is
e violence againstwomen. 0n the
front cover oi one issue at iiustler.
there is a photograph oi a
woman's legs sticking out oi a
meat grinder; coming out the
other end of die grinder is ham-
bruger. in another issue there is a
"postcard" of a smiling, nude

woman on a pool table, which
says. “Greetings front New Bed-
iord, Mass, The Portuguese
GangrRapc Capital oi America,"
in a third issue. a dead. nude
woman is slung over thc top oi a
jeep, positioned with her legs
spread. and a group oi men dress-
ed in hunting garb and carrying
rifles stand next to her; the cap
lion reads, Hunting Beaver.

This is the 3rd biggest selling
porn/magazme in the country,

Dear Editor:

After the decision on Central
America at the last J.B. meeting 1
was very disappointed. i really
thought that the proposal that has
been voted in by 40 other univer-
sities would be accepted by the
Grinnell Students.

In iact, one can say that this
proposal was accepted by the
Grinnell students because 536 peo~
pie agreed with and signed the
petition.

I would like to talk about my
feelings concerning Reagan's
policy in Central America. For me
the actual American ioreign
policy can be compared with the
Soviet ioreign policy. Don't tell
me that the United States fights
ior democracy and treedom and
that the Soviet Union fights to
overrule the world. There is little
difference between the two coun-
tries’ ioreign policies.

Yes. the Russians invaded
Afghanistan and stopped the
democratic movement which was
going on lYl‘POlaﬂd.'and I totally.

disagree. But the United States
overthrew president Allende in
Chile who had been democraticalr
ly clccted, to put Pinochet in
power, We all know who Pinochet
is and what he is doing, Is that a
right ior democracy and freedom?
By no means‘, it was a strong and
poweriui dictatorship; but the
United states supported and
helped it, is that a proof of the
American light ior democracy
and freedom '.’

And I could talk about Trujilio
in the Dominican Republic,
Batista in Cuba and some others,
None Of them were known as true
democrats But the American
government did support these
governments ,

What bothers me in the actual
American ioreign policy toward
Central Aineric to hear talking
of a fight for “Freedom”. This
word is really being debased. How
can one talk about freedom when
Reagan is sending help to people
who are trying to overthrow the
Nicaraguan government, a
government which has been
democratically elected?

After years of dictatorship the
Nicaraguan government has to
i'elearn the use of democra \' and
they might make mistakes
Everyone can make mistakes:
Am i wrong Mr. Reagan? And we
all know that the "contras" ai'c
Soinocistas For me there is a
total “contra“dlctloil between
the coiiti-as and a --iight ior
democracy

i could even go iurlhei- and say.
The United States is helping the
government in El Salvador and
the Soviet Union is helping the
government in Nicaragua, Fair
enough!

Vt hat

bolhers me is the

' hypocrisy oi the American ioreign

policy. 1 might be too idealistic
But i would rather hear Reagan
say: '1 am helping the "contras"
because I do not like countries
that do not like me, so 1 want to
overthrow them in order to have
my iriends in the government,"
And who cares if they are bloody
dictators. Remember Allende and
Pinochet. Which one stands for
democracy?

No. Mr. iteagan you cannot go
on like that indefinitely. You have
to stop sending arms and military
men to Nicaragua! You have to
stop playing that gamel You can-
not iool the American population
iorever, And i hope that the
Americans are going to react. and
react soon to this anti~democratic
ioreign policy,

As I said i might be too
idealistic. Grinnell did not even
react. f Christell Libiot
