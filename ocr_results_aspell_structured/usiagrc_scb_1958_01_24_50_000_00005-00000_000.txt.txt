Tankers Snap Knox Win String

s , Carleton, Warlburg: Tough Tesl

By Robb Madgett

Knox college, defending con-
fel'ence swimming champions,
lost in a dual meet against Grin-

ncll last Saturday, 60-36. it was »

the first Knox loss in their

home pool since February. 1952. . ‘

Again it was the pioneers who
broke their victory streak, this
time at 23.

Knox proved to be a much
easier {do than Grinnell bar-
gained (or. This was perhaps
due to the fact that the Siwashe
er’s were without the services
of two of their three best swim-
mel‘s, The only strong man in
the Knox lineup was their cap-

tain, Bob Proebsting. ProebsL-:
ing won the ZZOryard free, the
tall—yard individual medley and g

the loo—yard free, the only
events he entered. According to
conterence rule a swimmer is
only allowed to enter three
events in any one meet.

With the returns of the two
ailing Knox men, the Siwasher's
will undoubtedly be a different
team at the time the conference
meet is held at Lawrence college.

On the Pioneer swim team
there has been a great deal ot
improvement in the performance
of the new “green” material that
Coach lrv Simone is busily de-
veloping. “Guys such as Doug
Kirchner, Bill Murray, Tom
Castles, have all come a long
way since the beginning at the
season it just goes along to
prove what we at Grinnell ieel
about an athlete, I mean to say
that if a boy wants to put
everything he has on the line he
can make the grade whether he
has participated in athletics be
fore. All you have to do is bend
your knees and shoot the bucket."

The Grinnell times against
Knox weren’t up to par, but a

eCowles Racks Up ‘.
Kent Trophy lead; ‘
Basketball Follows

‘ By Tom Super

Cowles Hall won the intl'a»
mural volleyball crown again
this year and also took the lead'
away from Gates in the race
for the Kent trophy. Cowles
now has 970 points followed by
Gates with 830.

In the battle between the
underrated “B" teams of
Cowles and Clark, Cowles
took the first game but Clark
proved to be spoilers and
won the next two.

Basketball is next on the
schedule, beginning the second
week in February. Dibble and
Cowles again loom as powers
with the rest oi the halls tight-
ing tor upsets. Gates, last year’s
runnerrup in playoffs, has been
hit hard by graduation and
transferred and isn’t expected
to fare too well this year.

lot oi it has to do with the 25.
yard pool. Grinnell’s pool only
measures 20 yards. This could
prove to be troublesome since
the pool at Lawrence is 25 yards.

Thursday the Pioneers swam
a postal meet against a strong
University of Connnecticut
team. in this type or meet each
team swims in its own pool,
and then sends its times via a
night letter. in this way each
team knows how the other does
without too much delay. The
postal idea is a strong incentive
for the Grinnell team to put
forth a little more etiort in

practice. '

The Connecticut team was a
little too powerful for Grinnell

as they swam to a 50-27 Victory.
It was the Pioneers first defeat
this year, but will not effect
their dual meet record in any
way.

Bill Murray the Pioneer's dis.
tance man, set a new varsity
record in the Mil-yard freestyle
with a time or live minutes
and eighteen seconds ﬂat. (5:13)

pool record in the 60 yard
freestyle with a time of :28.5.

Carleton teams.

A new, yet well balanced
squad from Omaha university,
invaded Darby on Friday oi
last Week and walked off with
a 26-10 victory. Three Pio-
neer grapplers, Jerry Cooke,
123 “1., Dave Van Anrooy, X77
1b., and Bruce Wilkerson, KW,
defeated their men. But Dodd
Mjllar, 130 1b., Aris Ylﬂnlbas,
147 1b., Merritt McCall, 157
1b., and My Simpson, 167 lb.
met defeat.

Grinnell has been iorced to
forfeit the 130 lb. class in every
meet of the season. The lack. of
a candidate, thus awarding five
points to the opposition, has
proved a handicap to the squad.
However, plans are under way
to fill the gap.

The ‘grapplers’ played host
to Carleton on Saturday but
were defeated by last year’s
conference champs 2&9. Deci-
sions by Cook: and Wilkerson

ticipating in the meet were
Sim Gordon, who was defeat-
ed at 191 lbs. and Dave Man—
ley in a trash wrestling ex-
hibit-lon. Carl House and Dave
Grant, two other ir-shmen,
saw action on the same day.

On Monday, the mrtmen trav—
eled to Waverly and met Wart;
burg college in what turned
out to be the most evenly
fought mat/Ch of the season.

Cooke opened by pinning his
man. He was followed by Roy
Simpson who gained a decision,
and Van Anrooy who scored
five more points. Bruce Wilker-
son. (Jo-captain, battled his man
to a three point victory but the
Pioneers were shy by ’two
points. The final score was 18-16.

“The team is looking better
all the time.” stated JeXTY
Cooke, co-captain. This past
weekend was perhaps the tough-
est siege the team will have
to go through. "By the eighth
of February,” added Cooke, "we
will be ready for Monmouth.
Due to inexperience we have
been at a disadvantage, as most
of the other conference teams
have more returning lettemen."
