FAC trieisﬂto change the “Comma
campus’ self-Image

“Love Your Body Week" intended to bolster physical images of both men and women

by Sarah Neilsen
Staff Writer

Sixty women gathered in Main Lounge
Wednesday night to discuss one of the most
taboo subjects ofwornen's sexuality: mas.
turbation.

“We wanted to facilitate discussion,
combat the stigma, and help women un-
derstand their bodies,” Si’lld Richei Nevas,
'02, who led the workshop with Bea
Menentlez {04, and Kate Strangio, '05.

"It's impomntto iibemt: women's sexur
they," added strangio, “and talking about
masturbation is a good way to do it."

The masrurberion workshop was part
ofLove Your BodyWeek, whieh was sponr
sored by the Feminisr Action Coalition.

Love Your Body
Dayisairarionalevent
sponsored by the Nae
rional Organization
for Women “to speak
out against ads and
images oi‘woinen that
are offensive, harmful.
dangerous, and disrcs
speetful."

FAC decided sev.
eral years ago to ex-
pand the time Speciﬁr
Cally allotted for lov-
ing their bodies to a
week ”We want to one
courage thought about why bodies are
good," says Julia l—lahiwanger, '02, one of
the leaders of FAC.

This years week of body loving also
broadened the focus from improving body
images to a more general focus on physical
and mental health.

For instance, Tuesday’s event was a
women's health panel, eomposed of Karen

The arrdrenee was encouraged to share

Haltrwanger aeknowledges the lack of
men's participation in the week as a plobr
ism. A rneirs body image panel was held
Thursday.

“Last year we had a few guys attend,
though there were mostly women in the
andieneex‘ says Haltiwangei.

“This year we had more trouble find.
ing men to sperle, mostly besause we didn’t
want to ask anyone who had done it last
year."

Though men participated in lasryear's
match, none had attended any events so
far this year.

“We rerlize it's at a bad rims,” said
Halrrwanger. “lt’s midsems. and we didn’t
mean to be at the same time as Coming
Out \Veek. Bur we can eombat body im-
age problems anyway."

“Hererosexrinlity is so resumed," she
said, “It’s one orthose markets of privilege.
Hererosexuals don't have a comingeout pm-
Ccss,"

Thorsoanmith said she once received
a phone all at home from a resident of
Grinnell who had been in Carnegie, and
seen a “Queer safe space" sign on her of.
free door. “it was a young lesbian woman,
and she said ‘I thought I was the only les.
bian woman iii the whole city ofGrinnell,m
Tliotson-Smith related.

That, she said, is why she keeps a sign
on her door. “If just one person sees the
sign," she said, “that to me is what it‘ mans
to be an ally, You just never know when
someone will need [D see it."

other raeulry members said they, too,
try to make themselves open to any Stu-
dents or community members who might
need to talk to someone. “It's my duty as
an out faculty member to say, ‘Hey, here's
an open door,” Gordon said.

During the diseussion, one student
asked how the panelists’ experiences
changed after they left school, and another
asked how they went about finding gay.
friendly places to work and live,

“A: a student, there's a great freedom or
cxptcssing your own sexual identity, beoause
the strikes are not as high," Gordon said,
As for choosing a Friendly community in
which to live, she said. “i wish it was that
easy, but girlfriend, when you get the job
offer, you’re going to go."

Gordon added that moving to a place
without an established gayeommtinity ean
also simply present a new challenge. “It may
be that you become the role model in the
community," she said, “that you start that
group up." ,

Meehan agreed that it is possible to live
happily in places that might not be as open
as San Francisco. “Sure, it would be easier
to live in Berkeley," she said. “but this is
whetel gotayob. This is where l have kids."
