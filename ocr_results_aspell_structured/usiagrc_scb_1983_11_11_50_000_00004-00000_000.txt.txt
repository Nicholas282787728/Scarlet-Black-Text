Abolish the electoral
process

Last Tuesday was election day and some Americans voted. To these
people the electoral process means something more than social cathar—
sis. They believe that individuals who represent the popular interest
may rise through the American system of government to positions of
power to secure the common good, In ﬂieir political canon, savior and
politician signify the same ﬁling. Such visions of the electoral process,
however, do nothing to redeem a troubled society.

(USPS 483-000)

Americans must accept the realities and jettison the myths
associated with voting. Far from deciding the better of two enlightened
candidatees, the voter frequently has only to choose the lesser of two
evils, Can one sincerely maintain, should the 1984 Presidential cam-
paign narrow to a Glenn vs. Reagan showdown, that either candidate
approaches the realm of best and brightest? Nevertheless, some
Americans will cast ballots for die former spaceman reasoning that a
Glenn Presidency threatens less harm than another Reagan Presiden—
cy. Perhaps, but mis is an unfortunate way to select our rulers.

To be sure, the problem of hollow, stuffed candidates lies partly in
how the political system operates. Citizens play a minor role in the
selection of candidates for elected office. Through nominations, party
caucuses determine who will run for office, and ultimately, who will
rule, Our system differs only slightly from the Soviet system in this
respect: they have one party and we have two. Political parties, then,
pick candidates for positions in local, state, and federal gobernment,
hand these candidates to the voters, who in turn pull levers or mark
boxes, V0ters will remain spectators in this sphere until politicians
allow direct, popular elections. We can expect this change when, as
Khrushchev used to say, shrimp learn to whistle.

Unfortunately people will contine to vote, regardless of the absurdity
of the electoral process. They are pleased to be a part of this American
tradition, perhaps believing that through some flaw in the process they
will be heard. Woodrow Wilson dismisses this hope, saying “suppose
you go to Washington and try to get at our government. You will always
find that while you are politely listened to, the men really consulted are
the men who have the biggest stake — the big bankers, the big
manufacturers, the big masters of commerce, the heads of railroad
corporations and steamship corporations... The government of the
United States at present is a foster child of the special interests.”
Senator Russell Long explains how this situation came to be. Again,
much of the blame lies with the electoral process. “Most campaign
money comes from businessmen, labor contributions have been great
ly exaggerated. It would be my guess that about 95 percent of cam-
paign funds at the congressional level are derived from businessmen...
Businessmen contribute to legislators who have fought against taxes
that would have been burdensome to their business, whether the tax in-
crease was proposed as a socalled reform, a loophole closer, or just an
effort to balance the Federal budget.” Thus money, not ballots. deter»
mine the outcome of elections.

Americans will continue to vote. Rather than use indiviudal effort to
enact change, mey cleanse their consciences in an unresponsive, inert
electoral system. The vote, they believe, frees them from any duty to

help their fellow humans; the political system will see to it that of-'

ficials take care of unpleasant tasks. Voting, then, is morally reprehen-
sible when voters fail to recognize that their responsibilities as citizens

extend beyond-the polling place. In this way, the .vote is the most . .

dangerous concept to emerge from our pohtical'ti'adition

Letters

Dear Fellow Students.

As a result of many of our peers losing
federal financial aid due to the effects
of the Soloman Amendment, we have
decided to start a scholarship fund.

Though we do not necessarily oppose
draft registration, we do oppose the use of
the Solomon Amendment to coerce
students into registering. Because the
Solomon Amendment links ﬁnancial need
with registration we feel it discriminates
against economically underprivileged
students.

in response, we are establishing this
fund to make scholarships available to
students who have lost financial aid as a
result of the Solomon Amendment. We are
exploring the possibility of channeling the
scholarship funds through the Grinnell
Community Peace Fellowship, to be ad
ministered by us.

Our desire is for the scholarship fund to
spring from the concern of students for the
welfare of our peers We hope to obtain a
minimum of 1 dollar per student from at
least one»half of the student body, during a
canvas to take place November 15717,
Following our canvas we will approach the
administration, faculty, alumni, and
friends of me college, with the aim of pro-
viding a large enough fund to distribute
scholarships to all those in need. ‘

We hnpe you‘ll join us in our concern. 7

Editor,

The SGA curriculum questionnaire was
a fine effort to survey student opinion on
the proposed curricular changes. Ber-
nadette Connors deserves to be cone
gratulated for her attempt to assess stu-
dent opinion by quantifying and standar-
dizing responses to relevant questions. The
results drew a clear picture of student opi-
nion. As if to underscore the superiority of
quantification, the SGA also presented the
faculty with a confusing compilation of
student comments. The latter document
was of little value.

Questions concerning the questionnaire
were raised in the editorial of last week's
5518. Some Of the initial comments were
pertinent. While considering the results of
a questionnaire it is legitimate to study the
form of the questions and to ask if the sam-
ple was adequate. The conclusion reached
by the editorial writer, however, displayed
an ignorance of research methodology and
a disdain for the writer’s own peer group.
It is unusual to find a person so ignorant of
research methods as to openly advocate
that opinions be drawn only from a biased
sample, That the faculty should locus at-
tention on the most pugnacious‘students
and ignore the rest is unfair and
ridiculous, By offering the questionnaire,
Ms, Connors offered an avenue of expres-
sion to every student. By quantifying the
responses, Ms. Connors substituted
precise data for sloppy thought, it is the
mentally indolent who are unwilling toe
understand the value DE orderly data. —

Re: Registration and Financial Aid as it
concerns the students of Grinnell College.

Whereas The Solomon Amendment to
the 1979 registration law stipulates that all
males over a cermin age must register
before receiving Financial Aid, and

Noting that this can result in discriminar
tion against both all men in general and
the lower class men in particular because:

a) it is only men who must register

b) Usually it is the lower classes that
need aid

c) The lower economic classes will be
denied education at an unfair disadvan-
tage statistically, for the richer classes
will still be capable of paying their way in
the educational process.

' Realizing that Ari, III, Sec. 2 Of the CD“-

stitution of the United States says that,
“the trial of all crimes, except in cases of
impeachment, shall be by jury,” and that
Amendment V states that no one “shall be
compelled in any criminal case to be a
witness against himself, nor be deprived of
life, liberty, or property, without due pres
cess of law,” and Amendment Vl says that

,all must “have the Assistance of Counsel

for his defense,” and

Cognizant that denial of Federal Aid in-
volves no trial, self-incrimination by sign-
ing an aifadavit that says you have not
registered, and no counsel for the accused
(since there is no trial)
Be it Resolved

1. A letter be sent to the House, the Presi-
dent, and the, Supreme Court, and die ad-
ministration of Grinnell College deploring
the unconstitutionality of the Solomon
Amendment.
