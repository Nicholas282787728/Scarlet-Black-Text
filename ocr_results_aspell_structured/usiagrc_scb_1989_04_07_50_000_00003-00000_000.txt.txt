, Women's Support Group

No men

by Melissa Koch

“Contrary to its present rather
negative reputation on campus,
Women's Group welcomes
anyone 'without regard to sex.
race, color, creed, national or
ethnic origin, handicap, or sexual
or affectional preference.’ We
really are open to people of all
opinions and lifestyles; we’re
good listeners, we need your
input, and we believe that no
matter who you are you can con
tribute something valuable to our
group.” This statement comes
from the women's group that I
joined as a freshman. The
philosophy of the group remained
the same until this year. my
junior year. After being abroad
fall semester, I returned to find
that Women's Group no longer
accepts everyone unconditionally.
Men are now excluded at some of
the meetings, whereas in the past
they were permitted to all/end.

As a result of a compromise,
this semester Women‘s Group,
renamed Women’s Support
Group, has a new philosophy.
Sections of the new philosophy
contradict old philosophies on
Women’s Group. For example,
one section of the new phi-
losophy states that “meetings are
open to all women and are

strictly confidential . Ap-
proximately once a month
meetings are open to the campus
community, as decided by the
group." In the 1988-89 edition of
GO magazine, the article on
Women’s Group states,
"Women‘s Group at Grinnell has
a dual function: to educate the
campus as a whole on issues
affecting women and to maintain
a suppport group for its
members. We attempt to do this
through weekly meetings which
are open to all: the input and
presence of men are welcome."

This new philosophy emerged
due to conflicts between a few of
the women and men that were at»
tending Women’s Group
meetings last semester. Many of
these women felt that Women‘s
Group should be a support group
for women by women. They felt

that the group's goal wasn’t to
educate men about feminism, but
rather to educate and support
women on campus about femir
nism, There was some
disscnsion, causing some of the
males to leave the group.

Derek Kohles, who attended

allowed

Women’s Group meetings regu-
larly, was surprised by the
conflicts that arose. l-ie accepts
that Women’s Support Group is a
group for women. He calls the
new philosophy a “potentially
valuable move if it works as a
support group.” He is willing to
accept the philosophy even if it
means the exclusion of men.
Kohles understands that the
members of women’s support
group may need the support of
other women before they can
educate the entire population
about women’s issues.

According to Cassandra
Ewert, the current Women’s
Support Group leader, things
change in the philosophy of
Women’s Support Group each
semester depending on the people
attending. She feels that the
situation last semester demanded a
compromise in order to meet ev-
eryone’s needs in the group.
However, she said, those
individuals who strongly opposed
the situation with men attending
all of the meetings do not seem
to be avid attenders of this
semester’s meetings, She
believes that for now, the new
philosophy seems to be working
for most of the members of
Women’s Support Group
meetings.

Valerie Ingram, a senior
member of Women's Support
Group, prefers the meetings to be
open rather than closed to men.
Ingram comments, “I have felt a
sense of empowerment from
attending Women’s Group
meetings. The fact that people
find women‘s issues so important
that they would gather to discuss
them gives me a selfeaffirming
feeling." She feels that a
women’s group should educate
everyone. The primary goal, she
contends, is to introduce femir
nism lo 11er and second-year
students, especially those who are
women. Ingram explains that for
many women. this is their first
encounter with a women's group,
a place where they can talk and
feel comfortable about how it
feels to grow up female.

After their second year many
women stop attending Women‘s
Group. With each new semester.
new people attend women’s group
along with a few of the regulars.
This creates an environment

SCARLET AND BLACK

Chinese pass up American delicacies

by May»lee Chat

In China people do not greet
each other with a rhetorical “How
are you?” Instead they ask, "Ni
Chi [c ma?". . .“Have you eaten?”

Food is a national obsession
in China. it is a favorite topic
that can easily ﬁnd its way into
any conversation. Only Ameri»
cans' fascination with the weather
comes close to the interest the
Chi lose reserve for a wellcooked
meal.

This order is not misplaced.
The Chinese have learned to
make almost anything taste good.
On our group trips throughout
China, my American classmates
and I were served meals that
ranged from the unique to the my
credible. We have eaten all man
ner of don/u (soybean curd) from
glistening, soft, white cubes to
ehcwy. bark-colored patties. We
have eaten platefuls of well-oi led,
cold, orange mushrooms and
bowls of hearty strips of eel meat
and chives. We have even had
“phoenix and dragon soup" (in
actuality, made from the more
mundane chicken and snake).

And yet. even the most
adventurous traveler can get a
hankering for the familiar. This
is the situation we found our»
selves in on Thanksgiving while
we were on a trip to Xian (about
700 miles southwest of Beijing),
We had been stuffed full of deli-
cacies for days, but by that third
Thursday in November, our
thoughts turned to turkeys and
potatoes.

Our Chinese chaperon.
Teacher Wang, anticipated our
homesickness and made special
arrangements with the university
where we had been taking our
meals in Xian.

“We will have a real turkey,”
she told us happily. “But the
cooks do not know how to ﬁx it.
Who can tell them?" she won-
deled.

Fortunately one of our class
mates had studied for a year in
France in a Parisian cooking
school. At noon, with Teacher
Wang as translator, he explained
to the cooks what had to be done.
Then we left the campus to go
sightseeing.

open Tues - Sat 9-5

At 5 p.m. we returned, and
with images of turkey and stuff-
ing and mashed potatoes clouding
our vision, we stumbled into the
dining hall. No platters of
mashed potatoes greeted us. No
smells of roasted meat and
steaming stuffing filled our nos-
trils. The dining hall was bare.

We rushed into the kitchen.

The head cook smiled broadly
at my classmate. “Yijing :Ila
le," he said and pointed to the
plucked turkey lying on the table.
“Already killed."

Somehow something had
been lost in translation and the
raw, freshly killed bird had not
been turned into our Thanksgiv-
ing dinner.

My classmate the chef
immediately set to work. As he
took charge of the turkey, he set
other students to chopping carrots
and bread. Some of my class
mates boiled potatoes and then
mashed them. We all had some-
thing to do. (1 myself supplied a
needle and thread from my trav-
eler's sewing kit so that the
turkey could be sewn up with the
stufﬁng inside.)

Luckily it was a small bird,
and by 9 pm. it was ready to eat.
We felt this would be our one
opportunity to show our appreci-
ation to the cooks and kitchen
staff for all the meals they’d pre-
pared for us. We insisted they
join us4espite their protestsi
and served them first. We gave

them plates with hunks of turkey
meal. a mound of steaming
stuffing, and mashed potatoes
heaped on the side.

The cooks looked at their
plates with horror. One dabbed a
chopstick into the goo that we
called potatoes, Another gnawed
at a hunk of meat. As we tried to
press more on them, they backed
towards the kitchen, politely
shaking their heads. Then when
they saw that we were seriously
trying to get them to eat more,
they panicked, turned on their
heels, and fled.

We were puzzled. How could
anyone turn down a Thanksgiv-
ing dinner? Then we began to
see our “banquet" in a new light.
To Chinese eyes, we had served
them slabs of meat that could
only be gnawed instead of ﬁnely
chopped slivers that could be
civilly eaten with chopsticks.
We had given them bread and
vegetable stufﬁng straight from a
dead birds anus. We had forced
them to eat mnny, gooey, beige
potato~slime devoid of any to»
lure or shape.

“Do you think they’ll ever
forgive us?" someone asked our
American professor.

He only shnlggod.

The rest of us finished our
meal quietly. There was nothing
to be said. It is a humbling
thing to become fully aware of
one’s barbarity.
