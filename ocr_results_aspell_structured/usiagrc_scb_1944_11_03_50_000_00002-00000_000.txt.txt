The Discussion Continues - —

By Paul Spencer Wood

At the invitation of the editor I am ree
plying to the editorial in last week’s Scarlet
and Black. This letter, however, is less a
“reply" than a continuation of a friendly
discussion since I agree with the editorial
in in three main propositions.

1. The primary business of the college
is intellectual discipline.

2. “Intellectual discipline is not enough
. a college should be a full human en-
yirollment with opportunities for emotional,
social and spiritual, as well as intellectual
growth."
3. A proper balance is necessary be-
tween these demands on the student’s time
and attention.

Thus there is no doubt which activities
belong in the main tent and which consti—
tute the side shows of the academic circus.
The only question is whether the side shows
are at present unduly neglected, whether
the bearded lady and the living skeleton are
disregarded while the audience concentrates
on the dancing elephants and the high—wire
acrobats. Many an urchin can testify that
.it is hard to watch the simultaneous per-
formance in three rings and still do justice
to Bozo,“ the dogefaced boy. The greatest-
show-on-earth makes heavy demands on the
attention of its patrons; it always has done
so. Should it relax these demands, it would
sink to the level of a one—ring show on a
rural circuit.

The editorial asserts that because of
excessive class assignments three phases of
student ’interest are now being neglected
at Grinnell: extracurricular activities, at
tention to current events, war work. This
criticism, at least on the first two counts,
is perennial. Students never have enough
time to do all the legitimate and desirable
things they want to do. Neither does any
one else. College is like the world outside

. in that it demands a choice of legitimate
and desirable activities. Since Grinnell of-
fers nearly all the activities of a university,
opportunities of participation are greater
than in larger institutions. Even in ordi-
nary circumstances there is danger of over-
doing; often there are not enough gifted
students with free time fully to use all their

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

i opportunities. Today when the registration
is down about fifty per cent, this difficulty
is increased. In war time some activities
mllst sufferl

As far back as I can remember, students
1 have been criticized for inattention to cur-
rent world events. At Gl'innell, where in-
ternational affairs have been emphasized,
this criticism has constantly been heard
and has usually been less justified than else-
where In proportion as we know more
about anything, we deplore our ignorance
Since in war time current events are at the
peak of their interest, most people, both in
college and out, know more than usual about
world affairs and regret their inability to
know still more. The student has one ad-
vantage: his studies bear directly on these
interests; his knowledge of Caesar and Na
poleon helps him to understand Hitler. He
is better off than most other people though
like most other people he deplores his in-
ability to learn more. So too with war work.
No one that I know, in college or out, has
time enough to do all that he should.

So far as I know, there has been no
concerted effort to increase assignments.
To the best of my knowledge, professors
are assigning just about the same work as
in the past. This is considerable. A sixteen-
hour schedule demands 32 hours a week
of preparation, 48 hours altogether, or ex
actly one—third of the 144 hours in a six»
day week. Fortyseight hours should go for
sleep, and the remaining 48 must be dis-
tributed among the remaining demands up
on the student’s time. The requirement of
48 hours a Week of class attendance and
study is for average students. Some who
read slowly may have to use more. And
we must remember that hours spent looking

study. Students who work for part of their
college expenses have even less leisure than
their classmates. The budgeting oi? a stur
dent‘s time is always difficult. After the
interruption of a holiday or a few days of
illness it may seem almost impossible.

The regular work of a Grinnell college
student is a full-time job. It demands en~
ergy, persistence, selection. Were it to he
suddenly increased, it would prove unduly
burdensome. If, as the editorial asserts, it
has been so increased during the past few
Weeks, the way is open for relief. The
student council should investigate and if the
facts warrant, present them to the faculty.
Such a petition would be freely received and
impartially studied. Then if the case were
proved, appropriate action would follow.

It seems more likely, however, that the
appearance of a recent change in faculty as-
signments is an illusion, the usual prelude
to midsemester grade reports,

to do too many things at the same time.
Such individuals should consult their coulr
sellers and determine how to lighten their
academic, work, or activity schedules. Our
counselling system should take care of such
special cases.

Meanwhile much good may result from
frank, open discussion of the matters pre-
sented in the editorial. Such discussion is
a part of the democratic way of life. It is
to be encouraged among the opportunities
for growth—emotional, social, intellectual—
that, we agree, constitute the “full human
environment” of Grinnell college. Perhaps
ultimately such discussion may contribute
to our spiritual growth.
