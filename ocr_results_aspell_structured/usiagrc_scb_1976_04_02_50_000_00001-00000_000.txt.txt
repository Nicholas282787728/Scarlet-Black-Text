ﬁt Discuss European ties [Europe and the United
States: After 200 Years

The schedule for the conference is asfollows:

R

by Al Jones

Next week’s conference on
Europe and America is a
somewhat unusual affair in the
sense that rural Iowa in the
springtime does not seem quite the
place for distinguished American
and European diplomats to
descend from their aircraft and
discuss complicated international
problems. Yet Iowa’s emergence
as the breadbasket tor a hungry
world. a theme noted in last year’s
Food Conierence on the campus,
does make the state an in-
ternational force with which to be
reckoned. This was also noted by J.
Robert Schaetzel, the recent U.S.
Ambassador to the European
Community at Brussels, who
visited the campus last fall. His
Visit was the indirect inspiration
for the conference

Impressed by the international
concerns of Grinnell students and
of Iowans in general, Schaetzel
suggested to college officials and
the Delegation of the European
Community to the U.S. that they
jointly sponsor a conierence on
European-American relations.

Schaetzel’s 'concern about the
‘adversarial‘ nature of those
relations in recent years is shared
by the other American conference
participants, George Ball and
Robert Bowie. These former high

state department officials have
been instrumental in creating the
postv194§ European-American
alliance and have been identified
with the ideal of an integrated
European community tied by
political, economic, and cultural
traditions to the US, Like
Schaetzel, they have been
,dismayed at the deterioration of
these ties during the Johnson,
Nixon, and Ford years—years in
which the U.S. has neglected
Europe and the ideal of the
European Community by its global
preoccupations in Southeast Asia,
Latin-America, Africa, and the
Middle East. Ball, in particular,
has long been a dissenting voice in
American ioreign policy debates.

The European Community
participants, Mr, George Thom-
son, a leading Labor Party
‘Eurupeanist,’ the British
representative on the European
Commission, and Fernand Spaak,
the Head of the Delegation of the
European Community to the U.S.,
are less openly critical oi U.S.
attitudes toward Europe.
However, like many Europeans,
they are uneasy about the
unilateral nature of US.
diplomatic and economic policies
and about the deterioration of
European~U.S, relations. Come
mitted to interdependence,

cooperation. and international
institutions like the European
Community, which transcend the
nationstate, Spaak and Thomson
regret the revival of nationalism in
both Europe and the U.S., a revival
which puts in jeopardy the
signiiicant achievements in
European integration and trans-
Atlantic interdependence made
since 1945.

All the participants in the con-
ference can be expected to bring a
sense of urgency and a tone of
frankness to their discussion of
present European - Ur S.
relations. These moods extend
from a ieeling oi dismay over the
current state of international at:
{airs to a new anxiety about the
iuture of democratic institutions in
Europe, the U.S., and the Third
World. .

Doubts about the future of
democracy. ironically expressed in
this bicentennial year by such
American spokesmen as Patrick
Moynihan, have disconcerted
Europeans and Americans alike,
and this theme can be expected to
command attention next week.
Senator John Culver of Iowa will
address it in his concluding speech
on Wednesday night, hopeiully in a
tone less of doubt than of mid-
western agrarian idealism.

uth and Bob aim for participation

by Janet Pope

First she came in. Answering
the cliched ‘How are you?’, she
replied, “I’m not in a very good
mood right now” (which .of course
was not really true—she rarely
seems to be in a bad mood). She
explained that she had gotten a
Strauber paper back that ar-
ternoun on which Ira had com-
mented that she was involved in
too many things. Ruth Mont-
gomery, who was elected next
year’s SGA president. is busy these

iDuuglas Halsey rite scarlet and Black

days, Along with her presidential
activities. She is serving on this
year’s Finance Committee and
Student Publications and Radio
Committee.

A couple minutes later, he
bopped in, He is Bob Handler,
newlyelected SGA vice-president.
Like Ruth, Bob is now serving as
an intern. As a result of the
referendum passed at the end of
last semester, this year‘s cabinet
members will remain in ofﬁce until
May. Bob‘and‘ Ruth and the other

cabinet members that are selected
will work as interns under the
present officials.

With a flip of the tape recorder
switch to “on.” a formal interview
began. Neither future leader is
particularly iluent. However, by
continually talking about
student support and involvement
in SGA, they were able to make the
point that these are their main
goals Bob commented. “I think
the president and the’ vice»
president have the primary

responsibility oi saying, 'Here we

are,’ ‘Here‘s SGA and we want to
do Something’ and, uh , . . I think
the important thing is to get the
students interested."

Ruth expanded, “I think come
lnunicating with students both to
and irom, is the main respon-
sibility of SGA, because it's only on
that that we can act . . . Rightnow I
think the whole idea process is at
sort of a low ebb, People aren‘t
thinking about things that need to
be thoughtwr considered . . . vget
things going—get some kind of
momentum going on a community
level,”

Ruth talked about using the 8&3.
KDlC and weekly PDR meetings to
keep people informed and to
generate ideas. She hopes to use
time at SGA meetings more el-
ficiently by distributing agendas
and pertinent information beiore
each meeting.

when asked about speciiic areas
that SGA Could work on, Bob said
that he would like to see the EPC’s
,as strong and active as possible.
“I’d like to go over the whole EPC
structure, I think that‘s being
reviewed right now. I’d like to
continue with that,“ he com-
merited.

Practicum credits were men-
tioned by Ruth as an area of
speciiic interest to her. She also
commented, “As evidenced by this
proposal (the recommendation by
the Committee on Academic
Standing to reinstitute the D
grade) requirements and, um,
grading are about to come on us
any time. I think keeping abreast

.of that, being prepared to deal with.

that . . . being the iorce for ex—
pressing student opinion in areas
like that—but that involves a lot of
background work . .

Respect for one another is what
Ruth hopes for in dealings with the
administration. Bob mentioned
that he hopes for a friendly, but
‘definitely working’ relationship.

Ruth advocated a ‘rational plan’
for college budget cuts. Neither she
nor Bob had specific plans tor the
SGA budget.

At the end of the interview, each
again expressed hope [or student
interest and participation. Bob
explained that both he and Ruth
plan to encourage participation
in hall rep elections. He said that
they hope to get on things right
away. He commented, “l think our
main stress is going to be on the
election of hall reps, We want to
generate interest right now.“

chattering about plans of when
to meet the next day and who they
were going to see, Ruth and Bob
said their goodbyes and exited.

They didn't talk much about
specific goals or plans. The ideas
they did mention were not in-
novative or particularly exciting.
They were the ones that were
excited and enthusiastic.

The enthusiasm and the op-
timism oi the iuture president and
vice-president is exciting—
mayhe because it generates a
reireshing openness. After talking
to Ruth and Bob, one gets the
feeling that they will be able to get
people interested. Hopeiully the
two new executives will also be
able to coordinate and direct SGA
activities and goals.
