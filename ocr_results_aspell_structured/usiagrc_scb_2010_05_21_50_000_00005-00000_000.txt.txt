Helpthe (academic) environment

Gustavo Arambula will be heading to the Rio Grande Valley at the
southern tip of Texas once he graduates. He will be traveling south to
participate in Teach For America (TFA), a non-proﬁt organization that
sends college graduates all around the United States to teach in low-
income communities.

“I’ll be there for two years,"ArambLLla said. “Hopeﬁillyl can extend it
more, maybe pay of? my loans.”

Gustavo does not know exactly where or what he will be teaching,
although he ms accepted with the title "Fourth-Eighth Grade Bilingual
Generalist.” From this
descnption,Arambula has
developed his own theory.

“I thinkitwillbe either
fourth and ﬁfth grade
generalist, or I’m going
to focus on something in
middle school,'AraInbula
said. “They'll probably use
me for Spanish, ESL [English as a second language], or I have also taken
a lot ofart classes [at Grinnell]."

Thanks to some of his friends who have already graduated, Arambula
vos inspired to apply for TFA.

“I talked to them and it sounds like a great experience,”Arambula said.
“I'm very interested in workingin the ﬁeld oredueation, not necessarilyin
teaching, this is a new expenence."

Further down the road, Gustavo sees himself one day working in the
administrative oﬂices of some educaoon facility.

“rm interested in promoting higher education, in this case, among
under-represented youth," Ararnhula said. “In my case, that's how] got
herhthrough Posse."

Further down the road than Texas, Gustavo sees himself attending
graduate school to pursue this career.

“I was actually thinking of going into grad school for student affairs,"
Arambula said. " ‘ ‘ """ ‘ '

This ambition comes from his erpetience at Grinnell, working as an
intern for Director of Intercultural Affairs Dotty Slick. Arambula also
completed a fellowship for Slick through the National Association for
Student Personal Administrators.

"1 actually got an internship through them for this coming summer
which I am not going to be able to do,’ Arambula said. “It was actually
going to be at Lewis dc Clarke College, in the student attairs branch. I
was really excited, but summer or a two-year paid position? I‘ll take the
paid position."

Besides his administrative duties, Arambula has run the International
Soccer Club, been a Cabinet Mentor of The Student Organization of
Latinos/Lamas, sewed as the Multicultural Leadership Council Liaison
and organized last tails Latin American Festival, Through all of his
acquaintances, Gustavo sees the possibility otposio-ve collaboration.

“We have bivweekly meetings with allthe organizations that are under
Intercultural AEairs,”Ammbula said. “So I help organize those meetings,
just building stronger connections between groups. Groups you wouldn‘t
thinkwould come in contact are now organizing events together."

When reﬂecting on his time in Iowa, Arambula knows the people are
what made his four years special.

“The people here are amazing, the willingness to talk about anything,"
Arambula said. “The fact that you can be up two or three in the morning
talking about random stun: you can talk about gender, you can talk about
politics and just this openness is great.”

Arambula also loves the environmental contrast betwcm Grimell and
his home city.

“The tresh air,I come from Los Angeles, the air isn't that good for you
there, and you come here and it's just open,”Arambula said.

As he sets out for TFA, Gustavo does not know exactly where he will
be going from there, but he does what the basic scope ofhis focus will be,

“I’m going to wait these couple ofyear and see ifl'm still interested
in [teaching] or if I am going to pursue a career in education other
than teaching," Arambula said. “1 am deﬁnitely going to be around the

' ”education ﬁeld."
