9-4 Saturday

by Trcna Clelaud

In an unprecedented move
yesterday, President A. Richard
Turner, in a meeting with SGA
President .lon Neiderbach and
Dean of Student Affairs Jim
Tederman, agreed to approve a
boycott policy drawn up by the
Committee on Student Life (CSL)
and opposed by the sea,

According to Neiderbach,
Turner has never, until yesterday,
accepted a proposal affecting
student services over the strong

- objection of sea.

THE POLICY had been sent to
Turner by the CSL, alter rejecting
an alternative boycott policy
passed by Joint Boards last week,
Whatever policy Turner approves
becomes college policy,

Joint Boards voted down the CSL
proposal early in February and
formulated a second policy,
authored by ullscampus

representative Jim Stuart. After‘

considering the Joint Boards
proposal. the CSL last Thursday
decided to revise its own and send
it on to Turner rather than accept
the Stuart policy. Because campus
policies originate with the CSL, it
has the authority to decide what
policies will be sent to Turner.
THE MAJOR difference ln the
two boycott proposals is that the
CSL proposal rules out absolute
boycotts of any food item by the

 

Food Service, while the Joint
Boards proposal stipulates that a
complete boycott will take place if
60 per cent of the students voting
approve such a boycott.

Under the CSL proposal an
alternative food will be offered,
when possible, in addition to the
item in question if 20 per cent of
the students voting approve. Even
if 20 per cent or more of the voting
students want to. boycott Coca
Cola, for example, it would still
remain available; however, a
similar product, such as Pepsi,
might be offered as well as Coke
for those who are boycotting the
latter.

THE CSL, in justifying its stand,
states in its policy that “the college
does not see it as proper for a
service which is mandatory for
students to be used for the ex
pression of a political belief or
social cause unless that expression
is totally voluntary on the part of
the individual student ”

Stuart‘s main Criticism of the
CSL proposal is that a limited
boycott “would not put the same
pressure on the Food Service” that
an overall boycott would. Changing
suppliers, as happened with last
year’s lettuce boycott, “was the
strongest possible statement we
could make.” according to Stuart.

1 Boycott controversy prolonged .

CSL committee member Marca
Fox, one of the four who voted to
retain the CSL proposal, called it a
“better written and more
coherent” statement than that of
the Joint Boards and reiterated
the committee's feeling that
boycotts are an expression of “an
individual political opinion."

Turner apparently decided to
accept the CSL proposal on prin-
ciple. The CSL policy by ruling out
absolute boycotts, it has been
l argued. protects the rights of those
students, however few, who wish
not to boycott.

Neiderbach, who supported the
SGA boycott policy said he was “a
little surprised to say the least” at
Turner’s decision to back the CSL
proposal

“I feel really burned." he said,

“The issue here is really that of
the power of the CSL. Here we have
four appointed students and two
faculty members having so much
power and virtually ignoring the
elected Joint Boards, It questions
how much input students actually
have on social policies and
regulations. It would be a bad
precedent for Turner to go over
Joint Boards' head and adopt the
CSL proposal. I believe that if the
power of the ESL is allowed to

 

expand, we’re in trouble," he said,

KDI C brass reprimanded

by Julie Brand

The Student Publications and
Radio Committee decided
unanimously last Friday to
reprimand KDIC Station Manager
Kurt Anderson and Program
Director Steve Brull for “improper
action” in removing an-
nouncements of “Doc" Elliot
Pollock’s “Petty Cash Call'I from

‘campus mailboxes on February 27,

After a two hour meeting, the
decision was announced in a memo
along with a call for “stronger and
Clearer communications between
KDIC management and staff."

THE Petty Cash Call was to be
structured so that when someone
KDIC disc jockey Pollock called
answered in a certain manner. he
or she would Win five record
albums and $1.30.

The committee reached their
decision after hearing the rather
involved explanations of the events
that led to the “unstuffing” by
Brull, Anderson, and Hudson
Miller, KDIC’s production
manager. Pollock, who was not
consulted about the unstuffing,
received at KDIC a memorandum
that morning from Anderson which
explained the station manager’s
policy on commercialism,

POLLOCK felt he had received
”approval for his satirical promo
for KDIC" from Anderson early in
the morning alter the Loose Hall
Ball. Anderson Claims he was

“‘slightly inebriated” and shouldn’t

be held “accountable for what I
said or did.” Pollock exA

plained, “he seemed perfectly
sober at the time to me."
Pollock brought up his Petty
Cash Call project again in a luns
cheon on February erwith An
derson,where, since he received no
direct disapproval of his idea, he
assumed he should go ahead.
ANDERSON explained he had
“hoped it was like a lot of bad ideas
people have for KDIC (and that it)
would go away like a bad dream.
My fault was not realizing the
seriousness of Doc's intentions."
Pollock also quoted a cone
versation he had with Brull earlier
in the month in which Brull said,
“What you do to promote your
program is your own business.”
Brull agrees this was the general

idea conveyed.
WHEN Brill] discovered Pollock

had stuffed the mailboxes with his
Petty Cash Call announcements- on
February 27, he expressed his
disapproval and related An-
derson's dislike for the idea as
well. Pollock felt he had not heard
the disapproval from Anderson,
and still didn’t get a direct in-
dication of his disapproval when

the treaties should be ratified
Sophomore Ken Krimstein called
the debate ”very entertaining,”
and Said that “Moyer shined. made
his point well and was supported by
the crowd.”

FRESHMAN Sarnll Carter
asked, “Isn't the purpose to keep
the Canal open? Mayer addressed

this issue, and was looking to the,

future. Turner sounded like an old-
world politician."

Sophomore Danny Kadden felt
that Turner did not serve the anti»
treaty cause wcll.

“He wasn’t particularly
qualified to speak on the topic,
Although I totally disagreed with
him, i felt sorry for the man. When
he talked about making Panama a
state so we could put more people
on welfare. I lost it," he said.

NDNETIIELESS, scvcral
faculty members and Poynter
recognized that Turner's argument

less academic audience.

According to Don Smith,

‘chairman of the history depart-xx. ' . _

 

would have a greater appeal to a,

 

Anderson phoned him immediately
after his argument with Brull.

Although Anderson did not bring
up the Petty Cash Call, he read
Pollock a legal brief concerning
commercialism on public radio
stations. “I didn’t tell Doe I didn’t
like his idea because I did not have
enough tact, and I would’ve had to
tell him that I thought his con-
ception of KDIC was totally
unrealistic and unviable,”

BRULL‘S concern was that the
stuffing would be very bad
publicity for the station.

At 7 am. the next morning,
Anderson, Brull and Miller un-
stuffed the boxes after telling the
Mail Service Manager Ernest
Renaud that the Petty Cash Call
would be illegal for KDIC. Pollock
claims it is not, as yet. illegal.

Anderson says, “The actual
legality is not hard and iast; there
is a slight grey area to it. However
in the best interest of protecting
the radio station I thought that I
would follow the spirit even if the
exact letter of the law was not
there, and not have the Cash Call
go out.”

Moyer, Turner collide

ment, “Turner’s argument is more ,
effective than an academic
audience may realize. His
reiteration of ‘we bought it' would
be more compelling to another
audience,” he said, '

Mayer believes that the essence
of Turner‘s arguments Monday
night were emotional.

"I THINK Turner’s argument is
the kind of argument that is very
appealing to certain areas of
society. It is essentially an
emotional argument which would
have gone over better with a dif-
ferent audience. One has to accept
that the emotional point of view
exists," he said.

Moyer’s View is supported by
Poynter, who added that he knew
of two Grinncll businessmen who
thought that ’l‘urner won the
debate, Poyntel'leels that Turner's
views on the Canal won a lot of
support in town.

”I can say for certain that
Turner came off very well in
town,"v he said
