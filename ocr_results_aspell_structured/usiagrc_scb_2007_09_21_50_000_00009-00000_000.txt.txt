So much personality, it takes
two houses: the duPLEX

BY SARAH ERVIN AND Aim KARMETYAN

The six girls who live at the “duPLEX"sit in one oftlieir two
living rooms, curled together under blankets. Every few min-
utes during their easy conversation, the girls rake playful jabs at
each other. “Sorta gave me mono cause she's a dirryrslsanls ho,

the conversations of pub-goers on their way back to campus,
which Rothhaum describes as her favorite aspect ofthe house.

They may translate their love of pubrtalk into using their

in someone on Brianne's ﬂoor and the person asked me to come
by his room," Rothbaum began, but was cut off by Benness,
who ﬁnished the story, saying, “I used to hang out in his room
because he was on my floor, but he was awkward so Amy and
I became friends."

The seniors had known they wanted to live together since
the end of sophomore year, although they did not necessarily
want a duplex. In the end, however, the separation of the house
proved advantageous. “We all have pretty strong personalities,
which is why it’s good we have a dividing wall,” said Houlihan.

The girls only moved into their High Street house three

' weeks ago, but they considered themselves a household long
before moving in together. “We had “family dinner’ once a week
last year. We need to start doing that again," said Benness.

Even though the girls live separated by a wall, they see the

duplex as one home. Typically,

Despite the social beneﬁts that come from dorm life, the
girls are glad to have their own living space. According the
house residents, living oilr campus and on the second block of
High Street allows them to always have a quiet place, separate
from the Grinnell social structure to come back to if they need
it. “it’s nice to come home to and go nnrt door and have friends
there without all the drama from the younger days. VVe’re more
