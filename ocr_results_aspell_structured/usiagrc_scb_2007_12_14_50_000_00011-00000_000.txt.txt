The real progressive

As I was walking down the sourh campus loggin one
hungover morning, 1 came across a posrer rhar made me stop
and stare. It read. “Tell your Grandkids that you voted the ﬁrst
black President into ofﬁceioba 1’08."Tliis message struck
a chord with mc; for at the beginning of rho pmsidcns
tial campaigns. 1 was an Obama fanatic, and I often
thought of how progressive a step it would be , , "
to elect an African-American. Coming our
otthe Bush years, which were disasrrous for
many, we have enormous amounts ofpolltical
capital to generate change, and I felt that one
ofthe biggest changes we could achieve was
to elect Obama, because ofwho he is: black,
young and progressive.

But how progressive is he? Let us look
at some ofthe issues thnt I care about, and
which I presume are important issues for all
voters. As you will see, there is another candidate
who has a more progressive political program—and that
candidate is John Edwards. For example, I have a cousin who
is fighting in Iraq as I write this letter, and another is a nurse
in the navy. Obamn wants a slow withdrawal oftroopsiabout
5,000 a month, Senator Edwards believes we need to immedir
arcly withdraw about 50,000 troops and get all of the combat
troops out within 10 months, Edwards believes that expediency
is necessary to get the Iraqi government ro realize that iris es—
scntial rhnr they take action.

I also have had serious illness in my family, which has
changed how I look at health care. And there are over 45 mil-
lion uninsured Americans who are a step away hem earnsrro-
phe. Senator Edwards mandates health care for all Americans,
Obama does not. His arguments against mandates are that it
is wrong to require that all Americans buy into health care and
that OPETIII health cam Will he more affordable, But are these
argumenrs valid? Edwards‘ plans n-ears universal hcnlrh care
as a national imperative. Like social securiry and Medicaid,
the program only works if everyone contribures. lr individu-
als could choose to not pay into Social Security or Medicaid
on rhe presumption that they nnll not need it in the future,
but still had the right to collect later in life when they lcallzcd
they did, these programs would collapse, lfour goal is universal
health care for nll Americans, rhe same rule applies for universal
health insurance. An opt-in health care system would drive up
premiums and make hcalrh care more expensive for these same
reasons. Social Security and Medicaid mandates work, In 0:1,,

, inply nnr iht best option, Like Med 1. everyone
must contribute to any health care plan rhnr can cover everyone
in order for it to bc ﬁscally feasible. \

Finally, Obama ralks about reaching across the aisle to unite
Democlats and Republicans. Edwards does not reach across
the aislcihe tears down the walls of the building. Rather than

thinking about the rift in Congress, let’s think about the

rift in this nationiberween the rich and the

poor. the cuftauchiscd and disenfranchised.

Edwards wants to include those in the process

that have been pushed to thc side—the 37 mil-

lion Americans who wake up in poverty every

day. That’s not bipartisanship; that’s transpar-

Plantee’s thanks

As the whole Plantsgute episode ﬁnally comes to a closed
want to express my gratitude to everyone in the Grinuell come
munity for your supporr rhroughour this experience. I have
been able to experience hrsrhnnd the quality otthis institurion's
suppoi-r tor irs srudents, rhe loynlry otalumni nnd rhe closeness
otour rumpus,

From the second the story broke, Kntc Worster and the en-
rirc rcnm arWindso. Home made themselves immediarcly and
connnuonsly accessible. They made sure 1 had all the infor
mation I needed and assured me that they would support me
100 percenr in whatever course ofaction I decided to pursue, a
promise rhcy kcpr faithfully. Whenever there was any informas
non 1 required that rhey were unable ro provide themselves,
rhcy brought in alumni and raculry to lend their invaluable ads
vice. Throughout the entire process, there was no doubr in my
mind that my best inrerests were rheir sole priority, allowing me
to feel comforrable and supported the whole rims, and I’m so
thankful for all their help. Everyone should know the dedica-
rion and quality or Grinncll staff's service otsnidenrs. we are
very lucky to go to a school where no resource is spared for

Faculry have also been thoughtful throughour, checking in
to make sure I was doing ok and vcly tortsideiately nor railing
me as Rush Limbaugh predicted,

Lastly, l vvnnr to thank all rhe students and all ofmy friends
who have looked out for me, whether it was defending me
on rhe blogs, helping me laugh off hate mail or lending me a
Grinnell shirt for rhe inrcrvicw (Thanks, Kcllyl). Whenever I
started to get overwhelmed there was someone more to pick
me back up. I’m especially grateful to Pat at the S88 for being
so considerate as the story came out, to Junaycl for helping me
prep and sirring with me through the interview and to Andrew
and Kelsey for helping me escape the media after rhs Obuma
event.

At times this experience was exciting and enjoying, but it
was also intense and at times overwhelming. Your support has
meant so much to me; I am grateful and proud to be a part of
this community.
