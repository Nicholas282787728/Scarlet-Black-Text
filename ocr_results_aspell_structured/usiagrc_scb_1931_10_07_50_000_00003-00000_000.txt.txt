Season Opens

Pilbrow Favorite in Meet
With Iowa, Cornell

The Grinnetl college cross country
team will get its first test of compe—
tition this season when it competes
against the University of Iowa and
Cornell college in a triangular meet
at Mount Vernon, Saturday. Coach
Elton Rosen will have a green team
but it will he well balanced.

Myron Pilbrow, Missouri Valley
champion, is a favorite to take first
place, and if the rest of the squad
can finish well up in the race, the
Pioneers stand a chance to win. The
strength of Iowa is not known, but
the university men are favorites to
win.

in add' ion to Filbrow the Crinnell
team will probably include Bures,
Barber, Gerhardt, Conaid, and
George.

Pllbrow finished first in time trials
held Tuesday and Gordon, is fresh-
man, came in second. Coach Roseu
is exultant over prospects for the
1932 season when Pfeiffer and Gore
don will be eligible to aid the diminu-
tive conference champion.

Cornell-Grinnell Honors
on Football Field Even

Three triumphs, three losses and
one tic game. That’s the way Grin—
nelerornell football games stack on
the records as the Pioneers prepare
to battle the Purple on homecoming
day at Mount Vernon next Saturday.

Athletic relations in football open-
cd auspiciously for Grinnell in 1920.
That year and the following season
Grinnell won, 17 to o, and 13 to o.
The Pioneers took a heating for the
next three years consecutively, how—
ever, losing 3 to 0, 17 to 15, and 20
to 7.

The s to 3 tie in 1925, when a 3L
yard drop kick by Gordon (Butch)

eeter with ﬁve minutes to play
saved the day, was the ﬁnal game be»
tween the two colleges until last
year when Grinnell evened the score
by a 12 to 3 victory.

Grinnell has outscored Cornell 67
to 46 in the seven games, however.

 

Hlouse Chairmen Nome
Members of Pep Club

New members of the Crinnell col-
lege pep club are now being appoint—
ed by house chairmen, Walter Stra-
lcy and Ruth Goodenow, chairman of
the pep committee, said Tuesday.
The club will consist of four mem—
bers from each building and cottage
and two from town.

Ofﬁcers of the club will be elected
at the first meeting, to be held Thurs—
day evening. At this time, also, the
constitution of the club, written by
Walter Straley, Helen McLaren, and
James Clark, will be formally adopt-
ed, and plans will be made for stunts
to be staged during the year. Special
attention will be given to a stunt
for the Drake game at Des Moines,
on Nov. 21,
