Stubbs And Company Seek
Second League Swim Titl

The Midwest conference
swimming championship will
c- decided at St. Olaf col-
lege, Northfield, Minn, today
and tomonow, with Coach
Il'v Simonels Grinnell outfit
seeking their second straight
title. ‘

Other teams competing are
Carleton, Cornell, Knox, Law-
rence, Monmouth, and St.
Olaf. Although the teams
have met on a dual basis dur-
ing the season, the champion-
slhip will be determined entire»
1y on the basis of the conference
meet.

015 .will Be ll'ough

The Grinnell tankers are
slightly favored to retain the
title they won last year when
they nosed out Knox. Chief com-
petition appears likely to come
from St. Olaf land Carleton.
Until last week, Carleton was
generally considered to have the
best chance of,dethroning Grin-
nell. largely on the basis of a
close 4746 loss to the undefeated
Pioneers early in Fehraury, The
dope bucket was given a good
kicking around this past week,
however, when St. Olaf over—
whelmed Carleton 56-37.

The Oles appear to have hit
their stride and may give the
Pioneers some real competition,
particularly in the home st.
Olaf pool. Knox lost heavily hy
graduation and is in a rebuilding
process. Lawrence, Cornell, and
Monmouth, which finished for
back of the four leaders last

year, may close the gap some-I
what, but will have difﬁculty

breaking into the top four.
Survival Meet

Grinnell
calls the meet a utwo-day sur-
vival mee This is because
every event is run off twice, in
preliminaries and finals. The
meet is also unusual in that
first places should be split up
rather evenly among theseven
teams, according to the pre-
meet form chart.

Grinnell hopes rest on several
veterans Cocaptain Joel Stu’bhs,
who won both the so. and loo.
yd. races in last year's loop
meet, has gone undefeated in his
specialties this year and is is»
vored to repeat.

nunyau Strong Threat

Howie Runyan, the squad's
most versatile performer, is a
strong threat in the lzo-yd. indiv
vidual medley and the zoo-yd.
breasutroke, as well as being
the number two free-styler. Jun-
ior ro-ooptain Tom nejna, who
took third in the zooayd. hack-
stroke last year, is one of the
top men in the event this seas
5011.

Missing from the team will
be Wally Bragdon, a mid-year
graduate. Bragdon copped sec-
onds in last year's individual
