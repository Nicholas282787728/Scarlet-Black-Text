instituting a system whereby a

the organization does much to
raise the calibre of sports.

We still seem to be a 30-min

it was the ﬁrst 30, against Knox,

proved that size isn’t the most

The Pioneers are a small
club—only all strong. But ap-

playing football, and the sa-

lnlramural Board
Reduces Schedule

By Tom Soper

The flu epidemic which llil
Grinnell this fall forced the
Intramural board to set up
a double elimination tourn»
ament in place of the original
schedule.

In ﬂiis tournament each team
must lose two games to be
eliminated, Each team is award-
ed one point per win and Kent
Trophy points will be arbitrarily
iigured at the end of the sea-
son. Weather permitting, the
season will be over by Nov. 12.

To date, nawson, Clark and
North Younker have been elim~
inated, Gates and Smith remain
undefeated and the other four
halls have one loss each. John
Hokenstad and Armin Scharfe
have been the big threats from
Gates so far. Dick Kreiter and

-Jim Pfannenstell have made up
‘Smith’s strong line with Tom

Hess pacing their running at.

both of whom were very in, safe
fered severe setbacks in their
training schedule just at a time
when they appeared to be reach—
ing top condition. John Welden
and Chuck Yoak, who had been
dogged earlier in the season by
various mishaps, were able to
replace these two members, with
the support of Neevel, Kennedy,
King and Boughey.

in view of the ilat course
used tor the comer-once meet
in Chicago, the squad has
been working this last week
not over the hilly country-club
course, but on shorter dis-
tances over flat terrain to
build up wind and speed.

Monmouth college has been
unable to field a full team for
most of the season and its var.
sity squad tomorrow will prob.
ably be bolstered by a numlber
of freshmen. This will enable
Coach Simone’s barriers to prac-
tice controlled running and pace
themselves without the usual
pressure of tough competition.

honors has been and should con»
