said “It makes sense to come to the

is so high.”

Iowan hospitality ensured the

Aboud said the players “love Iowa.

but it kept them indoors most of the
time. They also were on a busy
schedule, playing nine games in as
many days; their only leisure time
was spent shopping.

Instead of being tourisrs in the

Though the overall quality of
play was lacking in the game itself, it
was still interesting to watch. The
Tanzanianpluyers clearly were not as
skilled as their American oountei‘r
parts and the game became pretty
sloppy on both sides. Some fans,
though, were having fun rooting for
the Tanzanians. The Tanzanian:
