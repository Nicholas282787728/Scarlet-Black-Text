College. responds
softly to the Iowa
Smokefree Air Act

uv CHARLES NET R AND BRIAN SHEMVIN

Outside the Cleveland Prrsr loungcglong a sanctuary for
smokers on campus—a new “No Smoking” sricke. sends a ines-
snge orehnnge in Iowa.

The sticker is in compliance with the Iowa Smokefree Air
Act, which went into effect on July 1 after being signed into law
by town Governor Cher Culver on April is. The law bars stue
— dents, staff, and faculty
from smoking tobacco
products on college
owned properry, and
requiles the college to
post No Smoking signs
and remove nshrrays
from nonsmoking are
cas, among other things.
While. administrators
and securiry ofﬁcials
said they would uphold the spirit of the law, rhey said it would
nothe on the top of their agenda. .

Besides posting signs and removing ashrr-ays, compliance
wirh rhe law requires rho college ro “ask people who are smoking
in a nonsmoking area orrheir business to srop smoking or to
leave the area,"accordlng to a Iowa Department of Public Health
broehnre on the law. Failure ro comply wirh rhe law could result
in civil fines between $100 and $500 for businesses, depending
on the number otviolarions The college is also required to his
form all employees about rhe law.

According to Stephen Brlscoe, director orseeuriry, rhe re-
sponsibiliry for reporting insrnnees of illegal smoking will fall to
the student body.

Dean of Students Travis Greene framed enforcing the law as
a sclfrgovernance issue from which the administration will stay
removed. “Campus Safety and seerrriry will not enforce the law,"
Greene said. The real applicarion orrhe ban, he said, resides in
“how other students hold each other accountable. I don’t think
we're going to get to the point where police are going into srue
dent rooms.”

According to jamaland RLC Brenda Hunt, whose cluster in-
cludes Cleveland Hall, there have not been any problems regard-
ing compliance with the law, There has been “no uproar," and “no
problems for the student advisms," Hunt said.

Paige swims 21 miles for CMT

nv ALi SARGEN’I'

Forget the water cube in Beijing, one orrhe mosr impressive
swimming feats of the summer took place in the Grinnell Colr
lege Obeimiller Pool inst Saturday, when Davrd Pnige ‘09 swim
for almost 11 straight hours, roraling n disrancc ot21 miles, and
raised an estimated 1,000 dollars (or the CharcotrMaricVTooth
(CMT) foundation.

What made tll veil more implesslxe is that Paige himr
selfhas CMT, n debi ng neurological dis-
order which doctors told him would strip him
or his nbiliry ro walk by the age onZ.

Last spllng, frustlated by years OfdlSCOulT
aging doctois and lack of CMT awareness,
Paige decided ro swim a mnr-nrhon to rnrse
money for the CMT foundation and aware
nCSS about the disease

To prepare for rhe swim, Paige spent hrs
slimmer at home in Omaha, Nebraska, folr
lowing a rigorous [mining schedule he developed himself in
which he exercised henveen four and six hours n dny swrmming,
kickboxing, wrestling and weighrlirting. “I knew! needed ro
strengthen my head and strengthen my mind in order to do this
very mundane, repetitive, extlemely difficult motion over a long
pcrlod ofrirrre,"Pnige snid.

Paige's mind was one thing, bur his body was another. “My
body very very rapidly rejected whar I was trying to do to it." ire

”i realized quickly that / had to
tram smart as opposed lojusl
[mi/5 to the wail: hard because i
was going to hum my body out,"

said. “I realized quickly that I had to train smart as opposed to
just balls to the walls hard because I was going re burn my body
out." .

Paul Bellora'lO, a close friend ofPaige’s who visited him dul"
ing the summer, emphasized that Paige’s greatest feat was pre~
paring for the swim, not necessarily the swim itself.“The training
was an enormous commirmenr and not something many people
could see or understand," Bellora said. “It was a huge thing to
do."

As the day or the othernl swirn ap-
proached, Paige, who all summer had been
feeling pain fatiguc and srress, finally felt
nothing. “ T re wasn't that pit orthe stome
aeh diead,”said Paige.“l guess rhit there was
just so mucll preparation that went into lL..
that i didn'r reel nnyrhi ...l was just ready.

called the increase in enrollment “astounding."
“I think people would have laughed at me had
I predicred [rhis increase] in just one year-,"Al-
ten .ln mosryear-s, Allen said, a two per-eenr
intrense is considered good.

The rnosr notreeabie rrdmrnrsrrrtrve adip—
