nearly "even in the rushing department with Grimlell gaming 229 yards to Cilrletnn's

element

By Bill Mcclung
Several evenings ago I was walking back to the hall

from the Quad and happened to be talking to John Cope—
land along the way I mentioned that I had concluded after
last Saturday’s game with Carleton that the essential di -

ference between the two teams was in the lines. It appeared l

Carleton's and that Without this
ditlercntlal the score mlght have
been reversed.

I was promptly sat straight on
a point oi strategy which was
likely unknown to the maiority
of fans at the game who, like
myself. find themselves wallow-
ing in a sea of football naivete
on fall Saturday afternoons. Due
to the ileetrtooted nature of the

Carl's Backfield, the Pioneer do
fensive strategy was {or the line
not to crash into the Carleton
backﬁeld lrl reckless attempts to
make the spectacular behind-the
line tackles, but to wait and slide
along the line in an effort not
to allow the fast Carl hacks lo
sweep the ends for long gains.

in theory. with this strategy
we would have to give at lcast
several yards on each play, but
the long gains would be mmr
ilnlzed. And indeed, that is any
acrly how most of the game
'ent. I left the game set fled
that both teams had played fine
ball; now that the line-aggres-
siveness uncertainty had been

for the Pioneers. He especially
praised Cornell's backfield and
its experienced interior line,
which averages over 220 pounds

that tomarrnw should be a "hot"
