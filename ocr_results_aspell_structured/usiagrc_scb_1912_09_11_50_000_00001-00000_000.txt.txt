things look like a great team. some
worry over the scholastic standings ol
certain of the stars has been manilest-
sd, but the latest reports are that these
will soon be raised to the required
level.

New Rules Favor Offense.
The rules ior this season have under-

gene a very thorough renovation by the
rules committee and have come out
with an entirely altered appeaialice.
Some or the more radical changes are
the increase or the number of dow s
to Tour while [lie distance to be gained
remains the same, ten . rds. This year
a touchdown will count six, a ﬁeld goal
three and a salety two points, The
ﬁeld will be but 100 yards long instead
of the hitherto customary no. The on»
side hick has hen eliminated and the
twenty-yard zone has been done
away urth. The iorward pass may or
or any length instead or twenty yards
or less.

This revolutionary alteration at the
rules was made because it was unani-
mously conceded br all the coaches and
the highest authorities in the name
that last year's l'illes did not mayo lor
good iootball; that they iailcd to pro
duce scoring lilnys and allowed charlie
to play too a great a part in delerliliir
ing the ﬁnal score. L . year the good
dolensite tram had the advantage as
was clearly demonstrated by sut-h
teams as Princeton in the east, and
Ames in the west.

The rules this year me made to
equalize the advantages ot both (it'-
isnse and delcnse. and because oi inst

. year‘s experience, iaror the oriensive
in mearly every instance. They will
or course, tend to make lot- more linc
plunging and close u-orlr, there being
four downs to make the ten yards. but
the removal or the twenty-yard restrio
ticn will allow lor much more brilliant

‘ open worlr, and the rule which allows
tor a lot-ward pass going over the goal
line promises more scoring and will
give a much greater repertoire or play-s
which can he used close to the goal.

' This will eliminate one or the prin
cipni tlciccts shown in last year's play,
namely, thc tact that an oilcnsive team
absolutely could not nlnlie headway
against a wall coached deleuse when
man the goal line, because the plays
wllIch werc sure were too few to dc-
ceive the dcicnsc The salrty .one
behind the goal lincs will make this
part of the ﬁeld as good for trrcit pill,
any other and will tend to giro the
good olicnsive team a much better
chance to score.
