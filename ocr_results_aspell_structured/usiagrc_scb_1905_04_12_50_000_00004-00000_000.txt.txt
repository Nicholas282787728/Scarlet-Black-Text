out rind this is what we ouglitlo strive
for in our new consiitntion.

The laSL- word is yet to he Said by a.
member of Institute who has had 3
very lougzexpeiience in debuting:

All ngreethat the present system
OI inter-society debating is unsatis-
factory. Interest ill debilte seems lo
warrant, three inter-society debales.
but the woiklug of the present
methods has brought out especially
two delecls: tone that Duly 6. tell: men
take perrlend lhcse, by guing into two
or three debates a year. not only must
carry too heavy It burden but leave the
debating materinl weak when they
stop for new debaters are not being
developed” and second securing a
debate in the spring term. Bolllthese
difﬁculties may be solved‘by hiwing
early in the full term a. general debate
between the strongest representatives
of each society who should be chosen
the previous spring, thus giving the
whole slimmerw work up the question.
From this contest as at present. it col-
lege team may be chosen

Then near the end of the fill] term
shall Occur a Sophomore debate which
shall be :between Sophomore members
and the two socieriesmld 21 third debate
the one between Freshmen of each
SDciety can beheld the last of Mal-ch.
The result of such a Series is to bring
into debating n continual supply of
new material. putting it against men
or equal experience. and then picking
the college Lean] from upper classmen
who have had at least uneor tWo years
Work in the College societies. This
will prevent a college team being com-
posed Of lower classlneu, who with
comparatively little experience, can
nothni-e the gcncrnlsbip Tequlred in
in] inte collegiate debate. A method
Similar to [his is being used zit» Iowa
City and other large Universities
where it is giving very good satisfac-
Lion.

captions, at number of little socinl
gatherings were given lor the mem-
bci-s ol Llle association, which have
done much to bring the girls into
closer and more sympnllictic relations.
The Christmas bazaar surpassed those
oi former years indisplayand receipts,
the amount cleared being 5145 all.

Tlieiocrezised interest and enthu—
sinsm ror Bible study and missions
has been a great encouragement to
those. especially, who are endeavor
ing to promote that phase of the work.
For. only were netire members in
crenscd but the interest token has
been oi nstronger und deeper nature,
During the year there has also been
an especial eilort made to make the
regulnr weekly meetings of the asses
cintion mean more to the members as
individuals. The ﬁnancial report
compares inrombly with lhat oi other
years. The year closed with the en-
tire budget paid and n bnlencc pl 302
in the treasury.

The ldeaoi extension work for the
Y. we. A. has been under consider-
ation for some time and since the
beginning of the new administration
suciiadcpartment has been created.

This has to do not only with [he
Uncle siim's Club but with general
extension work as well.

There is much to be said in praise
or the earnest elicits nod ell'ectuiil
work ofMiss Raymond and her cab-
inet or sincere workers, who have had
the welfare ol’ the association at
heart in their work.
