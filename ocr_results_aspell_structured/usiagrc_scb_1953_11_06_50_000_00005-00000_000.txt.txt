In Midwest Meet

This Saturday .3 ﬁve man
cross country squad will travel
to Chicago for the annual lMJdI-
West Conference meet. The race
will be run over the Chicago
University Washington Park
course.

Drake Could Win

The harriers team prospects
are not too bright but sopho-
more sensation George Drake
stands a good chance of being
the first Pioneer to ever cap-
ture the individual crown. How
well Drake dues depends on his
recovery from a severe cold
that kept him dut of last week's
Carleton meet.

One of Drake’s major Obstacles
to the mourn will be another
sophomore, Doug Hagen of
’Law'l‘ence. Elot'h have gone un'

year.

, in'lportant d‘uzl meet at Lawrence;
the two teams battled to a
28-28 draw with Hagen placing
first.

Grinnell’s chances of holding
the fourth place spot they gained
last year are slim and most: of
the burden will fall on Drake
and Frank Hays. These two have
been the only two barriers to
shcrw much hope for Grinnell.

the manner in which Coach
John Plitsch described Grinnell's
sophomore halfback, Tim Wall]?
er.
Pfitsch went on to add that
“Tim’s enthusiasm for body
contact is unsurpassed. Al-
though he still has a few little
faults, he learns fast and
makes progress every day.”
Tim, apparently fired up when
his brother Dick broke his leg
in the Lawrence game, has since
played inspired football {tor the
Pioneers. He is valued‘ highly on
the squad because of his good
all-around play and his
tremendous spirt. According to
Pfitsch, Tim is an excellent ball
carrier, reliable blocker, and a
devastating defensive player.

The 165 lb. Walker, who hails
from Waterloo, scored Grinnell’s
winning touchdown in its 7-0
victory over Knox in the vic-
tory which ended Grinnellts ten
game losing streak.

of the advantages of playing

itions. Then came Hays, Baker,

Extra Point Spells

Defeat For Carts
In A 7-6 Thriller

Playing some of their best
offensive ball of the year, Grin-
nell's gridders edged Carleton
7.6 last Saturday at Northfield,
Minn. for their second consecu-
tive victory.

Although Dick Van Maui's
toe supplied the margin of vies
tory, twc Pioneer touchdowns
by Nick Ryan were called back
by penalties.

Grhmell Scores First

Both teams tallied in the
second canto. Grinnell drew
first blood early in the quare
ter on Ryan’s two-yard buck
after a sustained drive of 77
yards.

Ryan and Don Hagei- were
the work horses of the march,
each biting off sizeable chunks
of yardage every time they car-
ried the ball. Ryan’s 28-yard
scamper started it off, but it
was Hager's fourth down plunge
of lo yards to the Carl’s four
that set up the score.

Fourth Down Pass cucls

On the subsequent kickoff, the
Maize and Blue drove to pay—
dirt from their own 39. With
fourth down and 15 to go, Varco
threw a 19—yard pass to Grein
for the Carl‘s six pointer. Sines
bakken missed the extra point.

Late in the half, Carleton was
in possession on Grinnell's 21,
but three incomplete passes
stymied their attack. And in the
third period, Coach John
Pfitsch’s pass defense again
stopped the Carls, this time on
the pioneer 10.

Ryan Runs Nullificd

Fourth canto touchdown
sprints of 7 and 17 yards by
Ryan were nullified by a pushel
ing and clipping penalty.

The Pioneers had the statisti-
cal edge, rolling up 14 first
downs to 5, and 213 yards rush-
ing to 33. Carleton outpassed
the Pfitschmen, completing 10
out of 20 for 112 yards, while

Huger and Ryan were out-
standing, rushing against the
Maize and Blue eight man line.
Hagar picked up 101 yards in
23 attempts and Ryan added 92
on 19 tries.

Pfitsch. as he took inventory of
the team’s physical status.

The Varsity mentor believes
Grinnell to be two touchdowns
better than the Monmouth
eleven, and shouldn’t have any

Finish Against Coe

After tomorrow's game _ with
Monmouth, the Pioneer gridders
will bring their 1953 season in
a close November 14, when the
Kohawks of Cue College jourr
ney to Grinnell to renew the
age-old rivalry between the two
schools.

If Coe can overcome a strong
Lawrence foe this week, the
game on the local field next
week will decide whether or
not the Kohawks conclude their
season in a ﬁrst place deadlock
with St. Olaf. At present both
title contenders are unbeaten.
