Phys Ed Complex To Open Today

At long last our 2. 5 million
lollar Physical Education
Iomplex is nearing comple'
’on. The College will have
111 use of the facility by the
nd of September, and at this
ime there exists a strong
tossibility that the entirepror
ect can be completed by the
niddle of September. The
lWlmmlng pool is done; final
aspection was held Wednesr
ay, and students should have
:ccess to the pool today.
‘ccording to John Pfitsch,

ofessor of Physical Edu'
ition, students will be per
tilted to use the swimming
001, but not the shower and
ressing areas, right away.
. pool party is planned on
iaturday evening for new stu-
lents. The "Splash Party",
which will be an open house
for new students, is scheduled
I) begin at 9:30 RM.

The physical education de-
irtment hopes to use the
acility for the department's
:ourse offerings beginning a-
:uout September 15. According
:0 Dale Hawn, Director of
Buildings and Grounds, the
College will get the use ofDif-
ferent parts of the building
is they are completed. AI—
hough he cannot assure the
;&B at this point that the
:Omplex will be ready Sep-
ember 15 for full use, Hawn
ndicated that final inspection
it the gym area is likely to
ake place prior to September
.0.
"'The main reason for do
ays at this point," said
iawn, “is the fact that the
:ontractor cannot get enough
zlectricians to do everything
that needs to he done any f“,
ter." This is the main rea-
son the building is not a!’
ready completed.

The College may not allow

the swimming pool.

"The swimming pool is e-
verything we thought it would
be," said Pfitsch, ”I think
it is great!“ The pool inn
cludes many unusual features;
for example, threerfourths of
the pool is less than five feet
deep and coustics are better
than normal for in indoor
pool.

The swimming pool is the
only one of its kind on an
American campus. Cruciform
in shape, 25 yards by 25
meters. the pool is dividable
into four separate swimming
areas. The tremendous height
of the ceiling and acoustic
tile will provide relatively
effective noise separation be-
tween the parts, allowing four
different types of activities to
take place simultaneouslywit—
hout interfenence.

The three units making up
the total complex contain over
33,000 square feet of floor
space. The Field House unit
contains two separate gym-
nasiums, each with 2 basket
ball, 2 tennis, 2 volleyball,
and 8 badminton courts, and
”island" gymnasium cone
taining 4 handball/squash can
ruts and a multi—purpose gym
area for dancing. Circling
the entire Field House is a
220-yard track with an 80-
yard straightaway.

The two story Support Space,
which separates the swimming
pool from the Field House,
contains a lobby, eight faculty
offices, a “selfrdefense”
room, showers, men’s and
women‘s saunas anddressing
rooms, and a golf driving
range. Three classrooms in
the support facility will be
convertible to recreation or
study areas.

Plans are in the works to
introduce the campus to its
new facility by a series of
open houses. Pfitsch envisions
two or three~day openhouses,
which would include regular
programs and special demon-
strations.

To make the facilityavailable
to citizens of the town of
Grinnell, Pfitsch would en-
courage groups on campus to
sponsor a monthly "Commu-
nity Night". Groups interested
in sponsoring one of these
events should notify Mr.
Pfitsch. The facility may be
open one day a week, per

haps Sunday, for use bythe
public. Pfitsch emphasized

that students and faculty of
Grinnell College will always
be given first priority.

Effects Of Freele
Unequal, Undecided

Grinnell College will freeze

many facultyand staffsalaries
for the time being as a re-
sult of President Nixon’s re-
cently announced ”New Eco-
nomic Policy." In astatement
delivered to yesterday’s far
culty meeting, President Leg-
gett announced that the Col-
lege would freeze the sala—
ries at last year '5 level, ex-
cept for newly hired facul-
ty, pending the outcome of
deliberations of the Cost of
Living Council in Washington.

As the College waspreparing
to announce its policy the Des
Moines Register carried a
story indicating that the mat
ter of faculty and teacher sa-
laries may not be finally sets
tied at this time. A National
Education Association spoke-
sman said thattbe President’s
Cost of Living Council has
shifted from its previous por
sition regarding teacher san
laries, allowing teacher sa-
laries to be increased if cone
tracts were signed andapprtr
ved before August ls. As yet,
the College has not received
official confirmation of this
change in policy.

If the shift has been made,
most members of the faculs
ty, who signed contracts be
fore August 15, would be ex-
empt from the freeze.

A number of accidental ine~
quities will result from the
freeze. B St G maids, who
started to work August 16,
the day after the President
announced the new policy,will
not be exempt, while other
BKtG employees who worked
through the summer have re
ceived pay increases sched-
uled in the union contract.
Some faculty secretaries,
who started work after the
freeze went into effect, will
not receive pay increases. Ads
ministrators whose contracts
took effect on July 1 are
exempt from the freeze, even
though some arefacultymem»
bers.

By 5&5 Stufferters

which had been established last year on a temporary basis.

Faculty Chairman Beryl Clotfelter’s written report of re
flections and recommendations on academic issues is sum-
marized in part on page five of the S St E.

Dean of the College Joseph Wall also reviewed academic
matters and offered suggestions; his remarks are reported

below.

Dean of Administration Waldo Walker reported on the fi-

nancial state of the college;

his talk is reported on page two.

President Glenn Leggett presented a statement of goals for
the college in the coming years and reported on the effects
of the recent wage-price freeze on the college; reports of
his statements are on this page.

Wall Proiecls
Academic Issues

Dean of the College joseph
Wall’s remarks to the faculty
touched on the areas of the
new curriculum, tutorials, the
distribution of courses among
the departments, faculty size
and salaries,andtheaoademic
issues which the Dean sees
as most important for the new
year.

Prevregistration figures for
the semester beginning Mon-
day show that course distrin
bution among the departments
have remained basically the
same as before implementa-
tion of the new curriculum,
with a few minor exceptions,
already noted last year.

Modern foreign language
courses were down in enrolls
ment, although Russian en-
rollment actually showed an
increase. The French, Span
nish and German departments
are smaller in staff size than
they were last year.

Dean Wall compared faculty
salaries at Grinnell to those
of the eleven other ACM sclr
ools, and to thirteen other li-
beral arts institutions, inn
eluding Oberlin, Reed, Swa-
rthmore, and Amherst.

Grinnell salaries are come
paratively high for assistant
professors and instructors in
both groups; they are come
paratively quite low for pro-
fessors and associate profes-
sors.

Five important academic
issues which the Dean believes
the faculty should consider
this year are worksstudypror
grams, career preparation,
independent study, the credit-

College Goals

President of the College
Glenn Leggett spoke to sever
ral points in his c10sing
speech, essentially a comr
prehensive statement of the
direction he would like to see
Grinnell take during the co-
ming years. He set an 11-
point “agenda" for himself
that involvedall principal con-
cerns of the College.

Leggett hopes to “cut down
on the need for frequent far
cutly meetings" by taking
more initiative through the
administration and Executive
Council, after appropriate
consultation with students and
faculty.

Among the primary goals of
die President are the estab-
lishment of viable systems
to evaluate teachers and the
new tutorial program. He sug-
gests “specific consideration
of whether our academic pro-
gram is suitable as it can
be for the women on this
campus", and hopes to in-
crease the number of "both
black faculty and staff and
women faculty." He hopes to
increase salaries, especially
for full professors.

He hopes to bring about a
"tighter and more consistent
standard for determiningweh-
ther students in academicdif-
ficulty should be retained or
not,” and to find a way to
"increase the number of both
admissahle freshmen and
transfer students."

Leggett suggests that stu*
dents can improve their ma-
nagement of the residence
halls, and that the number
