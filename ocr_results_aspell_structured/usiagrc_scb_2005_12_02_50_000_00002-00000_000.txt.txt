in the account.

Some, like Davis, wish to see the account Considr
cred in a committee setting. “A group ofpeople should
be working on how to spend it," he said.

Others, like Clcinman and Bohman, favor an inc
rormal approach, like an open forum. “SGA can be
kind of insular, Bohman said Our ideas arent neer
essarily everyones ideas

Bohman said he would like to see a campus-wide
discussion to create a plan of action

Cleinman worries the money will be spent in
piecemeal amounts, rather than in large sums where
he believes it can have the largest effect. “This is a gift
that’s been given to us from students before us," he
said. “This isn’t to fritter away 3200 at a time."

Ultimately, however, all three believe students
will be active in deciding where the money will go.
“Grinnell students have so many ideas about so many
things," Bohman said. “If there are resources to enact
those ideas I think they'll get excited "

Osgood, Thomas, Gibel- -Azoulay discuss affirmative action at panel

by DAVID MONTGOMERV

Students ﬁlled the North Lounge
Wednesday night for a panel discussion
on affirmative action sponsored by the
student Campaign for Increased Par
litieal Engagement (SCIPE). President
Russell Osgood, Senior Counsel to the
President FrankThomas ’71 and Katya
GibeerzOulay, Anthropology, gave
presentations and took questions from
members of die audience.

Gibcl-Azoulay spoke ﬁrst, outlining
the history of affirmative action in the
United States. While Presidents Ken—
nedy and Johnson took steps establish-
ing aﬁ‘umative action as law, “President
Nixon actually went the farthest,” she

Osgood ﬂeshed out the Constitur
tional history of struggles against racial
discrimination and ﬁnished by summa-
rizing the current legal status of affir»
mative action. “Today, race must be one
factor in a holistic process," Osgood
said, citing two 2003 Supreme Court
rulingsThose two, involving challenge
es to the affirmative action programs
of the University of Michigan and its
law school, overturned point-based sys»
tems of preference but allowed race to
be taken into consideration in college
admissions.

Turning to the speciﬁc issue of
Grinnell, Thomas rebutted what he
described as several myths about the
college's afﬁrmative action policy. “Af-

ﬁrmative action doesnt mean quotas,
he said Thomas, the former vice presir
dent of Diversity at the college, also
said that he had never directed the ad-
missions ofﬁce to "take someone's place
away" for a minority student.

Attendees felt satisfied. “The panel-
ists all gave scholarly arguments," said
Deyo Johnson '07. “That's what we’re
taught to do in class, and it was nice to
see them practicing what they preach,
so to say."

Jeff Raderstrong ’09, a member of

SCIPE, agreed with the positive sen-
timents. “[We wanted] to make peo-
ple think about something that they
wouldn't have thought about other
wise," he said.
