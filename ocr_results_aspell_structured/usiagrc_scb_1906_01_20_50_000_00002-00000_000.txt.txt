HALL iootball be abolished at
Grinnell’.’ The recent action of
several of the leading educational in~
stitutions of the country Vin, iiarvard
Columbia, Leland Stanford and others
in abolishing the game until the pres-
ent objectionable features are remor-
ed in e r i t s serious consideration.
When the agitation for return iii-st
began it ivasloolrcd upon as asort oi
iolre and was treated as such by a
large number. Ereryone admitted
the evils but at the some time insist-
ed that the game was so popnlur that
any attempt to abolish it uLd be
treated lightly. However, at the
present time the whole country is
aroused and the faculties and trustees
of all the great institutions are advo-
cating either radical reforms or com-
plete obolishment. When such uni~
versities as Iiarvard or Columbia

abolish the game, SCARLET AND
BLACK believes that the time has

come when Iowa College should take
a stand in this matter.

In the January Review of Reviews,
Dr. Albert Shaw, '79, says, “The bad
developments of football have grown
chieﬂy out oi theintensity oi competi—
tion between the leading universities
and colleges, The short and quicir
way to reform football would be to put
an end for a term or years to the inter.

collegiate games. Spanish bull ﬁght-
ing is humane and reﬁned as compar-

ed with recent American football.
Even prize ﬁghting is conducted upon
a higher plane of honor.” Another
prominent alumnus. and a football
enthusiast by the way, was heard to
remark that it seemed to him {is if
rootball Wits growing more brutal
every year and actor ushe was con-
cerned, the sooner football was :tbul-
Shed the better, Such comments its
these indicate that there is 2!. change
of sentiment even among the alumni.
In ouropinion the alumni are respon-
sible to a. great, extent, both for the
seeming popularity and for the evils
which exist. It is the alumni, who
manage the teams, seiechtlle players,
pay the coaches and even do mission»
ary work in order that their college
may produce a victorious team. That
the present system has its advantages
we do -not deny, but that the accom-
panying evils have wnrlred irreparable
injury‘ We are ready to :iﬂiun. The
only time that the student body is
consulted at all is when their lnng
power is needed and incidently, of
course when their price ior admission
is desired.

But to return to the case at hand,
would it be advisihlc LO uholisli 100L-
ball at Grinnell‘.’ SCARLET AND BLACK
believes thittit would and that the

sooner such action is taken the better.
Admitted, that many of the evils
which exist in other institutions have
not, appeared here, yet. even oul eth

 

which prides itself on clean athletics.
Themen were Laugh how to inyure
their opponents in the game without
detection and were shown several
tricks which any gentleman would be
ashamed to practice anywhere outside
ofatootball game. The watch word
was, “To Win find at any Cost," and
no matter what means you use. Of
course, you say, football is no pink tea
email and such things are to be ex-
pected, yet we ask it such a game can
be termed a inanly sport by any fair-
minded student.

For a number of years Griuneil has
failed to deleaL schools Whieh used to
be considered in our class, and so in
stead of friendly contests they have
developed into iiercc struggles or an
uncertain variety, and in many cases,
hard feelings have been awarded. We
beliere that Grinnell students l|S a
whole would not Object to the abolish-
menu of the game. The poor attend-
ance at the home contests clearly in-
dicates that. their enthusiasm is not
superabundaut. We believe t h a t
there are other forms of out. door
sports which would appeal to. and
which would beneﬁt; a. larger number
of students than the present. game
does. At any rate there is nothing to
lose find everything to gain by trying
the experiment for one year
