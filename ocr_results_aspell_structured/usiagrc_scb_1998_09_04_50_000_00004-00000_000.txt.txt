student banking'in Grinnell

BY DAVID NATHAN
News Editor

Fall in Grinnell means lots ofdecisions for
crinnell studentss Whar classes ru rake drop
or add? Whar acriviries ro sign up for? Whar
reams to play on? And usually srudenrs com-
pare all rheir oprions, ehher by looking rhough
course caralogues or going ro me acriviry fair
and make a dccision based on their skills, re-
sources and interests.

In mosr areas otcrinnell lire, rhere is plenry
of information available for students [0 draw
information from. Unfortunately, rhere is one
area that unril now, very lirrlc compararivc in-
formation with availablc. And that area is
banking.

Many Grinnell students find the idea of
having a bank accounr close by is preferable ro
relying on rheir bank at home or nor having
one at all.

beyond serving as a sate spor ro keep your
hard earned Quad checks, banks may orrer you
inreresr, checking accounrs, ATM and other
services.

Because Federal Law forbids ATM depos»
its across state lincs, students with horn: ac-
counrs in a bank without an Iowa branch mighr
and h easier ro make deposirs ar rhe forum
ATM than mailing checks back home. Be—
cause of their location, students can reach their
Grinncll bank with a local phone call or walk
in anyrime rhey are open, whid-i makes solw
ing banking problems easier.

Those reasons, and the fact few folks would
rrusr rhcir cash under rheir musry Grioncll is-
sue mattresses, make bank accounts a near
necessiry. The only question is, where ro bank?

crinnell rownship is served by four banks:
Branch Bank, locatedenérth misread, First
Federal Savings Bank, (formally Grinncll Fed»
eral savings Bank), locarcd ar 1025 Main
Street, Grinnell State Bank, 814 4dr Ave, and
FBLM Bank, (formally Security Bank Jasper»
Powershick) located at 1030 Broad, All four
