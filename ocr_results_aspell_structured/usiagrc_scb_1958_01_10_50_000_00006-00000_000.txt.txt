SCARLET AND BLACK

Pioneers Expected To Take Two; .
Mermen Swim St. Olaf, Carleton sports ,

By Robb

Madgett

Going against St. Olaf tonight and Carleton tomorrow
afternoon, the Pioneer swim team will have a full weekend.
This evening’s meet begins at 7:30, while the afternoon con-

test starts at 1:30.

The Grinnell mermen are fa-
vored in both meets. These dual
meets should provide the tests
necessary for the oncoming Knox
meet at Galesburg, lll., Satur-
day, Jan. 13.

It was Knox that defeated
Grinnell tor the conierenoe
championship last spring. Since
the new wnierence rule in
swimming, the dual meet win-
loso‘rewrd is very important.
,For this reason Simone is not
looking too far into the fu-
ture, but is trying to plan
each meet as it comes.

The St. Olaf meet should give'

Simone a chance to alter his
line-up in order to see what
certain men can doi There is
,also an added incentive as this
will be the Pioneers’ first home
periormance,

According to the times re-
corded in the early season, a
ifew varsity and D001 records

could easily fall. There is a
good chance for this in the 400-
yard medley relay, the hack-
stroke and the ISO-yard individr
uai medley.

“This team is in better after
vacation condition and spirit
than any that I have had at
Grinnell," said Coach Si-
mone. “There is tremendous
desire and drive behind the
men on this squad. The stu-
dents here at Grinneli are go-
ing to be seeing some very
good meets and some very
good swimmers perform.”

The Carleton team may give
the mermen a little trouble, as
the rivalry between the two
squads is very strong. Coach
Chet: Magraw always seems to
have a surprise in store for
Grinnell when the two teams
clash. As a result the Saturday
afternoon affair should prove to
be a battle of wits between two
seasoned coaches

MEMO TO MAESI’ROS: is your band dawdling instead of
mailing? Is it: full of feeble ﬁfers and drooping drummers?
Well, this musical slowdown may be traceable to lack of
Luckies. Better give your band a break—and make it a
Lucky one! A Lucky, you see, is a light: smoke—the right;
smoke for everyone. It’s all cigarette—all naturally light,
wonderfuﬂy good-tasting tobacco, And Luckies’ ﬁne to-
bacco is toast/ed to taste even better. Now then, what’s a
marching band that never gets 3 Lucky break? Why, it’s
a Sore Corps! (Wasn’t that cymbal?)

Tonight’s swimming meet
against St Olaf—the ﬁrst; home
contest of the present season—
promises little in the way of
breathtaking excitement be-
cause the visiting Lions will
again have nothing, and hecause
lrv Simone is once'again in the
process of moulding one of the
conference's top title contenders.

If the Grinneil tutor decides
not to “take it easy" the
score could well be so to x,
the Pioneers coming out on
the long end tor the fourth
time this season in as many
tries. If you plan to go, have
ever, get there promptly at
7:30. Simone has promised to
swim for a pool, team, and
conlercnoe record in the first
event-the 400 yard medley
relay. Add backstroke ace Art
Johnson (a sophomore phe-
nom who is swimming for the
ﬁrst nine at Grinneli) to a
team of Grindey, Jim Jacob~
son, and Dick Bresnahan and
the scrappy little coach is
more than likely than not to
break all three records.

Saturday afternoon (1:30) it
will be Carleton and a different
story entirely—even co-captain
Jim Jacobson could meet his
match. “Big Jake" will be pitbed
against Dave Murray, the
Knight's individual medley star.
Murray beat “Jake" in the
Minnesota relays last month
That race and the Sﬂl'pless
(c a r le t o n)—Bresnahan sprint
event should do more than make
up for the dramatic moments
that might be lacking mday .
