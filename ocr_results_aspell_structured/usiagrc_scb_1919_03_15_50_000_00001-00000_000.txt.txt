Misses Roberts
And Roosevelt Have Solo
Parts in Ployette.

The Girls' Glee Club appeared last
night in their annual homo concert in
Hel 'cl: chapel, hclorc a large and our
thusl'ztsLic crowd, composed mostly of
college students and faculty, altho thcrc
was a goodly number of town people
in the audience

Their pr-oglam which was varied
and well chosen, was featured by sevr
eral novelty songs and stunts. The
mean number on the program was the
annual stunt. The stunt this year
was written by Messrs. nlum and Wale
leser, of the college faculty, and was
named by them, "The Last Tea 0:
Tsuki." The theme was suggested to
the writers by an incident told in an
old Japanese legend. The solo parts
were taken hy‘ the Misses Rohei-m,
Wilkins, McVay, and Roosevelt, and
the setting and lighting effects pro-
duced a most chaiming spectacle. The
music by the orchestra was especially
pleasing.

Liberal W li Eucarcs.

The girls were Very liberal with
their extra numbers and enter-es.
which pleased the audience cxtreinely.
The group of songs sung by iiiss
Roosevelt were excellently sung. Miss
Daltin in ”Old Black Joe”, was also
well received.

The novelty hit of the evening was
in the form of a medley of popular
war songs sung by the Misses Fiske,
Donner, Sibley, and St. John, who ap—
peared as sailors. According to an an.
nouncement made by Miss Donner,
they were the only girls in the quad
rangle who had received letters from
men in the service, and they told the

,ﬁudience, in song, of the experiences
these soldier friends had had, in
France. .

The piano solo by Miss Allen was
exceptional and offered a delightful
variauon to the vocal part of the pros
grain

game, but were unable to overcome
the enormous lead which their oppon-

bacll strong after the intermission and
was able to hit the ring from all pans
of the floor. The Grinnell live failed
to get started until it was too late to
win. Their late rally was cut short
by the whistle which left the Nebraska
Live on the long end of a 27-1 score.
Jackson of N hraslia scored six times
from the field While his teammate,
