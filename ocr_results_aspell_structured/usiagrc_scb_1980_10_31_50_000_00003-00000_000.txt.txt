by Kalhy Wil/hoile

"It‘s a hard thing to have to say,"
said SGA Vice President John Conyers,
in his announcement 01 resignation
before Joint Board last Wednesday.

In his “swan song," Conyers cited
lack of time as the major reason {or
resigning. Fall break, which allowed
him some time to think, made Conyers
realize “why I was in Grinnell; and
what my priorites are. l have what can
only be described as an academic
nightmare at this point,” he said.

“By no means is this tresignationi a
protest against the cabinet or SGA or
the administration," stressed Conyers.
Having considered his role to be one of
bringing outside views to the attention
of SGA members, he found no need to
do so this fall 7 “which is a good com-
ment on SGA and one less reason for me
to be here," he said.

Conyers did, however, admit to a cer-
tain rrustration with Skip Day and "a
lack of anything glamorous or concrete
gomg on right now ”

or Conyers‘ resignation, son presir
dent Paul B. Volker said, "It‘s too had.
We had a very good working relation
ship. I'm sorry he has to resign,
although I understand his reasons and
respect his decision."

Conyers‘ reSignation Wlll be effective
upon the election of a replacement.
Details regarding the application pro-
cess for the vice presidential position
will be announced Soon in the Campus
