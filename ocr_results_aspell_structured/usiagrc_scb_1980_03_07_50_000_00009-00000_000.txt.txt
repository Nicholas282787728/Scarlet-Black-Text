When it comes to academic scholarr
ships ior graduate work the Cadillac
and Mercedes are The Rhodes and the
Marshall Scholarships. The Rhodes is
given to only 32 graduating seniors in
the United States each year. Rhodes
Scholars attend the University of 0x-
lord {or two or three years and never
have to pay a cent

“Quality of both character and in-
tellect is the most important require-
ment for a Rhodes Scholarship," said
professor Don Smith thimselt a
Rhodes Scholar as was President
Drake) It helps to be a genius, too

Because the Rhodes is so com~
petitive, some years no applications
from Grinnell are made. Smith said
his role as sponsor is “not to raise
ialse hopes” with potential applicants,
Although the Rhodes needs no college
endorsement, a local committee on
campus reviews potential candidates.
Grinnell's last Rhodes Scholar was
Susan Duliy in 1973.

The Marshall Scholarship, awarded
to only 30 students a year, like the
Rhodes, provides ior two to three
years of free education Marshall
scholars have the choice of studying at
any university in the United Kingdom.

You're probably saying to yourscli
right now, “These scholarships are tor
geniuses. Where does the average,
plodding student like myself turn for
pocket money?" Well, charity begins
at home and the best bet seems to be
asking good old Uncle Sam.

For graduate work there's the NSF

In the summer of '78 a team of five
Gl‘lnncll students received a grant of
several thousand dollars to study
stream cliannelization.

NSF also grants money tor research
and equipment needed by schools. In
the past two years Grinnell has been
on the recelvmg end at several large
grants: almost $11,000 for biology
equipment and $12,000 for chemistry
materials The DNA research being
directed by professor Ellott Uhlenhopp
received a grant of almost $122,000.
Several other grants are pending in
biology, sociology, and psychology.

Another major federal program

Robertson said that while NSF and
