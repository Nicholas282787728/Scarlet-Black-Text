. HE gains with East High Satur-

day is deserving of the patronage
of every Iowa College student. Aside
ironn alldnnncial and moral support
which your presence in the grand
stand anords, there are more seliish
reasons why all should attend. Those
wholilreioot ball will be interested
in observing how the new rnleswili
work while those who iorrnsrly dis-
liked the game should be generous
enough to give the new system a trial

HOSE who are scolIers should
not lightly pass over the fact
that the Y. M. C. A. meeting toinor-
rnw night is to be led by Chasnnrrey.
This gentlernan is a speaker who has
annessageiorall, Christian and iron-
Christian. lie is not a shouting l'e-
yiralist or anything or the sort. but a
straightiurward. clean cut. deep
thinking iriend of all men who wants-
to help you Mr. Hurrey is nothing
it not practical and is willing to talk
with yoniranlrly to any extent that
you wish. His meeting is not a trap
to get you into the Association hot to
helpeach man to deal with the prob»
lems which come to all college men
and which he knows so well.
HE increased interest in tennis,
manifested by the competition
for places on the courts and the laying
out oi new grounds on Ward Field,
are highly encouraging and,desirabler
We need a varsity team and the ins
creased court space also oﬁers opporv
tunity ior many who would otherwise
take no exercise to gain some physical
heneiit iroin out door work. How.
erer, all this great amount of pains,
taken iorthe berieiitoi the ineu, leads
us to wonder why the women or the
College are not allowed asiinll’tlr priri-
lege or healtliiul exercise in the open
air. They can walk and ride in the
'open air, orcourse. but the men could
do the some, besides there is an out-
door basket billl court, to loot bull held
and a cinder track for the men who do
not care ior tennis, while the women
are compelled to take to the railroad
track or Arbor Lake. It the tennis
courts back or the Cottage were made
usuable we are sure they would tot

lie idle much of the time,

PRES. MAIN AT THEGRANT CLUB

AS announced last week, Pres. Main
gave an address before the Grant
Club of Des Moines on the subject,
“College Ideals in Business Life.”
This club Is one of the most power-
iul political organizations or thestate.
The fact that Mr. Main and his Sub-
ject are so interesting to this as-
socialion of practical business men is
sigiiiiicant of the regard in which
such men of the world hold the ideals
oi the college man The address point-
ed out the fact that going to college
'5 a business and that the college its
sell is 'd. business insLlLullon “Mich
requires the cooperation, not the
charity, or busmess men. The co‘lege
man in business retains his ideals and
5325 things in their broader relations
and as they ought to be. Furthermore,
the valuable things of [his world de-
pend upon the men who hare to do
with them and not upon themselves.
The college inantliereiore is the one
who imparts Lllegreatcst \‘ﬂlue to his
possessions.
