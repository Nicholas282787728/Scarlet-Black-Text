Men‘s Basketball Opens Play
with 2—3 Record

by Karissa Taylor

The mUSIC was not all that was
jamming in Darby Gym at the
Grinnell Tiproff ToumamentNov.
16717. The men Pioneers, sporting
their new warm-up suits, set the
tone early for what was to be an
exciting weekend of basketball.
Both nights. the men were able to
run the score to more than 100
points. and Friday night's 132—104
victory over Mt. St. Clare broke
both the Grinnell and the Darby
Gym previous records in scoring.

The starting line-up for the Pio-
neers consisted of center Chris
Jacobson. George Mellmsey. Hol~
land Neai.AlanThomas and fresh-
man Todd Young. However, as
Coach Arsenault predicted, subsu-
luuorlwasquitei‘requentand played
a key role in both victories.

High scorer from Friday’s game
was freshman Dave Mussaii. who
scored an impressive 33 points from
the floor. including ﬁve 3-pointcrs,
in his firstseasongameatGrinncll.
Jacobson led the Pioneers in rcr
boundswith13,:indcontribulcd20
points as well. Senior co-captain
8.]. John also pulled down 9 re-
bounds, und Young was able to add
15 points to the scoreboard.

Saturday's game was by no
means less exciting. The Pioneers
hit 52 percent from the ﬂoor, and
were able to walk away with an
unexpected 119-100 victory.

Leading scorers for Grinnell
wereJticobson andcorcaplain Neal.

Mchmsey. 61 senior forward, led
in total number of rebounds. fol-
lowed by Jacobson. Jacobson also
managed to block 13 shots in the
tournament. Once again. Mussatt.
along with freshmen Craig Studer
and Thomas. left their mark on the
court with l5. 9 and 10 points to
spectivety.

“It was a great way to start out
what has the potential to belt good
season for men’s basketball.” he
said.

He did add, however. that he
hopes the men didn't gain a false
sense of security from the game.

Unfortunately. the winning trend
didn‘tcominue in lhePioncers' last
three games against Wartburg.
Rockford and Huerta Vista.
Arsenault commented that
Wartburg was a quicker and more
experienced team.

He also said that Wartburg is
probably that best team that Grin-
ncll will play this season—which
actually says quite a bit about the
Pioneers, since the halftime score
was only 52-55 Warlburg.

“Wewereclose,"saidArsertault.
“a step behind them. but ti step
ahead of last year."

Neal and Young led in scoring,
and Jacobson and Mclimsey in re-
bounds. The final was 12295.

ents. The Pioneers were extremely

There were, however. a few
bright spots to the game. Neal had
an exceptional game, sinking 14 of

in general. Coach Arsenault is
quite optimistic about' die season.
He feels the men need to get back
more quickly. for as he told Jim
George (Sports Info), “Our upr
tempo styleofplayrequiresagreat
amount of effort and concentra-
tion.” If the men can demonstrate
tllose attributes. they can definetly
meet the season goal or 12-20.

that he felt that the high level of fan
