Wednesday, February lo, 1941 :'

.Welcome, Dr, Simons

Last night marked the beginning of another
series of lectures conducted by the history
department. These lectures are given each
year in an attempt to stimulate the Grinnell
student’s interest in understanding the
forces of recent history which have helped
to create the bewildering world in which
we live,

Dr, Hans Simons, who is the guest lec»
turer this year, is well qualified for this
form of extracurricular instruction. At pre
sent dean of the graduate division of the
New York School of Social Research, Dix
Simons previously was an organizer of the
League of Nations society in Germany, and
an official of the Pomeranian government.
Simons is already familiar to several Grin-
nell students and faculty members as one
of the speakers at the International Rela-
tions conference held on this campus last
summer.

We cannot expect Dr. Simons to give us
a solution to the grave problems which now
so greatly concern the world. But through
intelligent discussion and an histori-analysis
of the present situation, Dix Simons will give
us a better understanding of the forces ex—
tant in the world today, and the background
of history that mothered these conditions.

The purpose of these lectures can only be
fulfilled by the active support of the Grin-
nell students and faculty member , Here
then is an opportunity for those u lo want
some information in addi 'on to that re—
ceivcd in the classroom concerning those is—
sues oi today that are so vital to each and
every one of us.

0 A Fair Break for Management

Thulman W. Arnold, assistant attorney
general of the United Statcs, totifying' be-
fore the Tempon National Economic come
inittcc in Washington, said recently that
probes into unialr methods used by labor
unions by the Federal Bureau 01' Invc ti»
g'ation wollld have to be discontinued be»
cause the Supreme Court, ill ruling on the
Hutcheson case, held that the strike of one
llnion against another was immune from
prosecution by the policies ol’ Congress.”

The Hutcheson case dealt with a jurisdic—
tional strike between two American Federa-
tion of Labor unionsﬁthe carpenters and
machinists. The carpenters refused to arbi-
trate the issue, and the employer was faced
with a strike on his handsiu'hethcr he
turned to the carpenters or \l'llether he turlr
ed to the machinists. The, unions were pro—
secuted under the anti-trust laws and duly
convicted. The Supreme Court, by dint of
its decision, allows union labor to continue
to squabble within its ranks while the em,
ployer loses time and money. There is no

‘leg 1 machinery to stop this bickering be—

tween brothers, and the law makers appear
to have for ‘otten that employers have any
rights at all,

Mr. Arnold, during his testimony, cited an
example in which longshoremcn, belonging
to an A. F. of L. union, boycotted certain
lumber , lrds, refusing- to allow lumber to
be unloaded at the docks or transported to
a yard which employed C. L O. labor. Such
actions on the part 01' labor impair the
rights of rkers in any particular plant to
join a union of their own choosing Under
the law, however, that right is guaranteed
them by the National Labor Relations Board,
No matter how enthusiastic workers may be
for a particular union, that union cannot
prevail against one that is larger, possesses
more economic alliances, and is prepared to
make use of those alliances.

The employer and many employees are
not getting a square deal under existing
labor legislation, and the labor unions are
using to the front as special pets of the
government. If we are to continue to have
iree enterprise, limits have to be placed on
the powers oi' unions. Legislation must be
passed making unions liable to the unfair
practices in which they indulge. The laws
of fair play demand it.
