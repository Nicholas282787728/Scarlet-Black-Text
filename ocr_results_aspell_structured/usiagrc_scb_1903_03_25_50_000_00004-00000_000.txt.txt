ance two years ago to ﬁnd its pai‘r

receive a perfect perfoimance

His voice is icmnilcable for ll

ibiiity and ﬁrmness. and is entire
iy tree from forcing. Hrsternpern.
merit is that of the earnest mus-r
chin, and in such ll’yliig composi
tions as the Strauss Songs, the
sweep oi irrs musical conception

and his marvelous vocal porrer

fairly carried his hearers off then

feet. The accompaniments were

played nragrnhcentiy by Mr.

Smith.
