Student Council elections are drawing uncomfortably
near. Two weeks hence, the council‘s future for the next
year will be determined. So what? Is the campus going to

change its face overnight as the new personalities with
their new ideas take over? Probably not. This campus

doesn't take to change very ‘easily.

What do we want in the people we are going to elect?
We cannot honestly or accurately evaluate candidates on
the merits of their platforms and ideas. This is true for one
very basic reason: a SC president is the presiding officer
in a meeting of a diversified group of students. Everyone
in those meetings is, it is hoped, capable of having an
adequate degree of common sense and imagination. it is
the function of the president to remember, understand,
co—ordinate, interpret and execute their ideas.

Therefore, since we aren‘t looking for campaign
promises, we must be looking for leadership. That’s a pat
word and embraces a lot of nebulous territory. It is the
comprehension of ideas and the ability to execute them,
the ability to get along with people and command their
respect. It is being able to express thoughts to people with-
out stamping out their originality. It is the ability to be
objective and unprejudiced, forthright and reliable in the
statement of facts It is being able to communicate with
various interest groups: students, faculty and administra-
tion. It is the ability to trust others.

These, basically, are the things we should be seeking
in our next officers. Unfortunately, however, we tend to
let the extraneous and inconsequential influence our decis—
ions. Should we?

SCARLET AND BLACK

Sticks
and
Stones

By Paul Bass

Grinnell is growing a little
each year, you know, and the
twin ogres of enlarged classes
and the use of “student num-
bers” on the IBM registr
tion cards will one day
frighten students into 1a—
menting their lost identities.

It is our intent just now,
however, to applaud the one de-
partment, or at least the one
course, where the Grinnell stu-
dent stiu receives the care and
attention boasted of in the cat-
alogue.

The department is that of
economics and business. The
course is one entitled
“Money, Income and Employ-
ment," 3 course just as com-
plex, I am told, as its name
and it would not have been
foolish to suppose, at year's
beginning, that a number of
budding economists might
have trouble with it.

As a matter of fact, more than
a few of them had more than
a little trouble with it, and
when the final grades came in.
a handful of studentswere found
wanting. Their grades were
poor. They were below average.

In our less enlightened de-
pnrtmcnts, a final grade of D
or F generally produces a
blighted gradepoint and dark,
,muttercd threats on the pro-
fessor's life. The student feels

that he has been cheated, the
professor feels that he has
been wasting his time, and
everyone ends up hot and
nasty.

This situation is surely in-
tolerable. Why should the pro-
fessor be thereafter labeled a
fraud, merely because he has
done his duty? And why should
lhe student be penalized, mere-
ly because he has not done his?

Kissinger Hits U. S. Policies,
Urges Broad Re-evaluation

By Tenn

Significant new insights into American foreign policy
were presented in the .Rosenfield lecture series February 19
and 20 by Dr. Henry A. Kissinger, many time consultant
to foreign policy and strategy planning groups.

In his three lectures, devoted respectively to problems,
strategy, and diplomacy in American foreign policy, Kis—

 

and business has answered
these questions to the satisfac-
llon, presumably, of both par-
ties. The answer, and it is a
splendid one, is this: give the
poor kids another chance. Tutor
them for a month. Let them
take another shot at the finall
In brief, suifer the little chil-
dren , . l

Result: the institution of an
economics night school, sort of
n remedial class, composed
solely of npperclassmen, who
Wade anew into “Money, In-
come and Employment" with
high hopes (and every chance)
oi improving their grades.
What happier solution could

there be? The professor emerges
a kind, fatherly type, and the
student, a little chastened, hugs
his new grade to his breast.
Everyone beams warmly,

There is one tiny discrepancy,
of course: only those students
who received low grades to be-
gin with are treated so patern—
ally. But this is such a trifling
matter! What would the C and
)3 students want with B's and
A’s? And what would the A
student want? A cash award?
Preposterous,

In is this sort of thing I like
to see. You know—a real
guarantee of the student’s in-
ﬂividuality. An honest attempt
to make every Gﬁnnell stu-
dent at least average. A blow
against “mediocrity is its own
reward."

I do hope the idea takes hold,
and spreads to other depart<
ments. 1 have always Wanted to

singer, author of ”Nuclear Wea-
pons and. Foreign Policy" sug-
gested that a sober second look
at contemporary diplomatic
planning was needed due to the
twin developments of rapidly
advancing technology and the
worldeide national indepen-
dence movement.

Discussing problems andlim-
itations of American planning,
Kissinger stressed that these
arose basically from the best
in the American character:
humility, the will to believe
in opponenls' good faith, and
suspension of judgment until
all facts are in. He stressed
too, that in pointing up prob-
lems, he implicit? recognized
that Substantial achievements
had been made in specific
areas.

Present strategy has been par.
alyzed, Kissinger claimed, by a
preoccupation with an all-out
war concept that has rendered
the most powerful military es»
tablishment the world has
known the least effective base
from which to negotiate.

He advocated re-examination
of the nature of military pow-
er, and preparation for limited
warfare as the only answers to
slow but sure enemy advances.
A policy of quick, decisive in—
tervention with conventional
weapons or tactical nuclear de~
vices, emanating from a re-ot—
ganized Pentagon and Joint
Chiefs of Staff is the only vi-
able policy, Kissinger assertedl

While not greatly optimistic
about the immediate comple-
tion of Sllch a rib-organization,
he stressed that much can be
