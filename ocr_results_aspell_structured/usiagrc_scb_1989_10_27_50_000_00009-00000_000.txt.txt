This symposium reﬂects an on-
going expansion of the scope of the
Rosenﬁeld Program

"The program is broadening its
mandate and adding a humanities
dimension." said program director
Wayne Moyerl “We hope that this
conference will serve as the second
step” — last semester‘s symposium
on women in developing counties
having been thefirst— “in acontin-
ued new emphasis for Rosenfieldl"
The new emphasis is designed to
allow greaterconsideration of issues
that might otherwise be obscured on
campus.

Underscoring the importance of

what has been planned for the sym-

“It’s about time the college fo-

Leitinger to Edit Journal
011 Women in Costa Rica

Ilse Leitingcr. assistant professor
of Sociology,willeditaspecialiss'ue
ofthcjoumalWomen’sStudiesInter-
national Forum. focusing on Costa
Rica.Theissueis scheduled forpub-
lication 1n 1991 and would be the
first issue of the scholarly journal
devoted to a Hispanic society or to a
developing nation,

According to Leitingcr, the jour-
nal will include articles on a wide
range of topics related to Costa Ri-
can women. including health and
sexuality. self-esteem, history. polir
tics and grass-roots organizing.
National issues, such as the prob
lems of Costa Rica’s rural workers,
will be examined from a variety of
perpectives. Leitinger said. Thejourr
nal will also include art. ﬁction and
poetry.

“There'sa great deal of awareness
and activity surrounding feminism
in Costa Rica,” Leitinger said, “I
hope that the material we include in
the joumal reﬂects the rishness of
the debate about women’s issues in
that country.”

The majority of the country’s
population is underage 15, and nearly
half of the babies born there today
are children of single mothers.
“Because of this, Costa Ricans are
very. concerned about issues like
child care and education," Leitinger
said.

Costa Ricans are also working to
pass legislation that Leitinger saysis
comparable to— or even better than
7 the Equal Rights Amendment.
“Yet the word ‘feminist‘ has had bad

connotations in CostaRica.” she said. 1
“People whom we would probably
describe as feminists don‘t want to
be called that because for many the
word has a negative meaning."
Lcittngcr has been a member of
Grinnell‘s faculty since 1976. She
has traveled widely throughout
Central and South America, and

Ilse Leitingerl

spent last year in Costa Rica as a
FulbrightScholar,teachingwomen’s
studies at the country’s National
University and researching discrep-
ancies between the legal and social
status of Costa Rican women.

She is on leave this year from
Grinnell and is continuing her work
with the Interdisciplinary Center of
Women's Studies at National Uni—
versity.
