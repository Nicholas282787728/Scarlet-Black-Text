These demonstrate that, like with
the White Sox,our society is capable of
redemption for its moral flaws.

This could be through policies of
world poverty reduction or the promo»
tion of peaceful resolution of conﬂict:
we have done both before in Limited
degrees.

In any case, we are nor an inherently
evil country as some may like to believe,

and it is not time to write off our de»
mocracy as dead, as several posters on
campus thiswcckimplicd. Baseball fans
(including the few Sox fans out there)
by and large remain loyal and hopeful
for their team's success, even in the face
ofscandal and heartbreak.

While remaining critical and resils
ient in electoral opposition, we should
do rhe same for our country.

The issue at hand is 10/10. We were told that

complaining in

is always more
fun that doing it
alone.

people that don’t attend this college will be present;
parents, townies and undercovers (the police). If you
didn‘t get these warnings you must not have good
bowel movements because they were posted in every

‘stall I went to.

As a student body that “believes" in selfsgow
ernance we have to help our fellow classmates stay
out of ttoublt: If we see someone going against our
beliefs we are accountable for getting them back on
track. If they don’t listen, hey, you didn’t your part.
He, who lives in the past, will be lost in the future.

Boycott Coca-Cola

Connect the dots and protest Coke’s human rights abuses

As we sit in the safety and comfort of oul
Grinnell homes and wait for another Iowa winter
to settle in, the world's poor appear as a remote
Other.

We read about them in our classes, we make
donations to charity causes and sometimes, when
the news is slow, we see a brief portrayal of their
struggles in the news, But this They is an abstract
group, disconnected and dispense
able to the functioning of our
lives. They are not us. They do
not lead the same types oflivcs,

When Grinnell students can
not wait for their shift at Cowles
Dining Hall to finally be over,
men and women around the world are working in
dangerous, demeaning conditions simply to survive.

The differences between our lives at Grinnell
and the lives of many oppressed peoples in the dee
veloping world are astounding. so their problems
are not our own. How can we feel connected to
these people that are nothing like us?

Our commonality is our
humanity. The factory worker
and the Grinnell student both
deserve safety and freedom.
Every family deserves food,
shelter, and equal protection
under the law.

Every child deserves to
know rhar her or his guardian
will not be taken away in the night. And every pare
ent deserves to know that they are not endanger-
ing their children by fighring for their basic human
rights,

When corporations like
Coca-Cola violate these basic
human rights, we are all affected.
The desperate situations of faCr
tory workers in Colombia and
communities without clean water
in India are desperate situations
for all ofus.

Oppression is not limited to any group or area in
the world. The longer we let oppression continue,
the closer it comes to taking hold of our friends,
families and ourselves.

The workers at Coca-Cola bottling plants that
are threatened with termination, blacklisting or
even death are nor just another They that we cannot
help. We are connected to these workers and their
families by our actions as consumers.

By collectively practicing responsible consumer»
ism, we direcrly affect rhe lives of peoples discns
franchised by corporare cruelty. By stopping Coke
consumption we send two messages to our world
community.

We make a demonstrative statement to Cocae
Cola that we are disgusted with their cruel practices,
the lack of protection for their factory workers and
their unwillingness to investigate rhe murders of
unionists inside their factories. We also send a meSs

and nurse/vet

What IS VFD?

Every day, the residents of the V'FD hall wake up
to [ace another Very Fastidious Day of work. work, and
more worlc It is our only hope thar every morning when
we wake up we have Very Fierce Defenses available.
However, we face a Very Frightening Dilemma since
Hallovecn and Viciously Foul and Desmlctive people
have been stealing our Veapons of Fierce Defense.

It's fun ifyou come and hang out on our floor with
such well‘read people as us, but why steal our VFD‘s?
And ifyou don't like it, then we shall leave to you to be
prey to the Verevolves, Vitches, Vampires rind Villains
that roam the campus. So, if you Hr. a doing this we ask
you to please stop your Various Foul Destructive acts.
Being that all, we hope you have a Very Fun Day.

Voices of Grinnell

The longer we lei oppress/on
continue the (later fl (times in
taking hold ofour friends, families

sage ro the factory workers that Grinnell College is
ﬁghting in solidarity with them in their battle for
just, safe working conditions.

coca-Cola representarives know rhc power of
rhese messages. Thar is why they deny their re
sponsibiliry for workers'livcs in their own factories.
They are afraid ofthe powerful effects oforganized
protest.

They know rhnr rhis is not
a boycott of their product, but a
boycott of their practices. They
know rhar our message will be
noticed and that our actions will
be modeled after.

Other colleges, high schools
and gioups willjoin the boycott and the CocarCola
factory workers will feel rho srrengrh of uniform
opposition. The power of 1,400 voices must not be
underestimated. Grinnell College has the ability to
further empower the people that are hurt by Cocae
Cola’s Corporate malfeasance.

I say "further ompowcr"because these people are
not powerless. They have the ability and resources
to fight their own battle and
are doing just that. No one
is asking Grinnell students to
jump on a plane to Colombia
or India and demand the right
to unionize from factory mane
agers or to demand that Coca-
Cola srop polluting lndian

water sources.

You are being asked to work in tandem with
these people, by fighting along side them with the
resources you possess.

Workers oppose CoeasCola
and its bottling factories on site
despite the dangers ot’a civil war
and a corporate supported para-
military threat. Grinnell students
can oppose CocasCola and its
bottling factories in the safety of
their homes by boycotting Coca-
Cola,

CocasCola, like any other corporation, owes all
its workers protection from danger while working
and the right to unionize.

Coke must rakc responsibility for its manyviola‘
tions ofhuman rights, They must stop hiring paras
militaries to threaten workers who try to unionize
and dumping waste into factory communities’water
sources.

Nine union members are dead, hundreds fear
losing their lives and many more are without a
union to protect them. This is not a question of
source bias or of more college kids complaining
about corporations,

This is a struggle for the fundamental right to
live and work in safety. Fathers, mothers, and Chile
dron are fighring for their basic human rights with
their lives. Is it too much to ask that we fight with
our soft drink choice?

Thanks for the Coke resolution

I’m glad the resolution asking the college not to
renew its contract with Coke passed in Joint Board this
wcelc I think it’s a step in the right direction—show-
ing our support for a movement begun by Columbian
trade-unionists, and pressuring Coke to effect posi—
tivc change. Knowing Grinnellians, I want to caution
students abour the backholr that rends to happen after
(what I consider) a small victory on campus.

I'm sure that some Gl‘innelljans‘ will try to claim
that the rights of a “silent minority" ofpro-corpomﬁon
students have been trampled on. In response to re-
cent acu‘vism aimed at ending Grinnell’s contract with
Coke, what has prevented a pro—Coke student group
from forming?

Consider how underrepresented important events
in Latin America are in mainstream intemational news
covetltgc in the US. when you think about whose voice
is silenced on campus. Support the upcoming student
initiative for another small victory.
