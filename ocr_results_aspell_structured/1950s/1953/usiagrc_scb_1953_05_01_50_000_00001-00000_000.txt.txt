will make the final decision on
the rule. Several council mem-
bers consulted with the Parr
sonnel Board, the agency uffi»
cially responsible for this ruling.

A committee was formed by
the council to gain all infor—
mation and opinions possible re.
garding the effect of a car rule
on Grinnell college social life
and traditions.

The council officially ap-
proved a compulsory linen Ser-
vice for all students next year.
A poll of the halls indicated
that only 22 people would ob—
ject to this rule being compul-
sory, There were several obv
jections and some discussion as
to the justification of a com~
pulsory rule of this nature. lt
was pointed out that many col.
lege services were of a com.
pulsory nature.
