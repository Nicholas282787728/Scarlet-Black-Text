We’ve Got the Team

In all our days at Old Gl‘inllell we never heard as much
noise as the roar from the stands when the Pioneer basket-
ballel's dumped the Cornell Rams. That night it seemed that

a winning team was going to make Pep-Clubs (and all the
other devices that try to sell Grinnell teams to Glinnell
students) seem ridiculous.

Deal‘ Everybody,

Since any of my letters which
may still be hanging around are
rather outdated I thought that
those of you who may be inc
lerested in the recording project
might appreciate a progress re
port.

You \vil be glad to hear that
the tape has been sent to RCA
Victor to get set on records. The
project should be finished in
about two or three Weeks at
which time you who have shown
interest will receive your copies.
I'm looking forward to visiting
you at that time to oversee the
distribution.

Also there will be a few un-
ordered copies so if any of you
have become interested within
the past month and would like
to reserve a copyv come ahead.
The address is still 2212 Mell‘OSe
street, Rockford. Ill.

Yours truly,
Jim Ploss

P. S. I wanted to wish you
all a happy and prosperous new
year, but at that time I thought
the college might take it ser-
ious and raise the tuition.
Happy New Year, anyway.

IOpen letter to the student Body:

The Board of Religion wishes
to clarify its position on Tuesday
night Vespers. Our policy has

Ybeen and will continue to be to

let each individual volunteering
to give vespers present what
seems to him to be the most
fitting service.

Each individual has a right
to be heard, but such a right
carries with it the obligation of
making what one says approp»
riate to what vespergoers have
come to expect and want in
such a place and on such on
occasion. Tuesday night Vespers
is a service of reverent medita-
tion held in the chapel.

We of the Board of Religion
wish to express regret that this
tradition of individual freedom
in the leadership of Tuesday
night Vespers has been abused.

Sincerely,
The Board of Religion

The team has kept up its side of the story. Coach John
A. Pfitscll's young men have won four in a YOW for us
now, are rated third among the Iowa colleges and univer-
sities, and have won three and lost one in conference play
for undisputed possession of second place. Bob Winter is
Second highest scorer in the conference with an average of
23.5 points per game, only eight-tenths of a point behind
Olmstead of Comell. Dick von Maul‘, Dave Stumbaugh, Bud

Add to this the fact that they’re a good looking bunch‘

Talks on Cars

in order to clear up all ru-
mors regarding the number of
men leaving school at the end
of the semester, Dean of Men

 

nil-inu- mil: Iain Chrlnensen,
Marty. Mary Noam, Dick Peter-sou.

 

Henry A. Bro'wn disclosed the
following facts Wednesday.

As the situation now stands,
there will he 11 men leaving
and 15 new or former students
will enroll for the second se-
mester.

The car situation brought furs
ther comment from Dean Brown.
”it is against college regulations
to have a car on campus without
advance permission. At the pres
ent time there are 25 cars reg-
istered, including married and
town students, and about 65 cars
on campus."

Some students have wondered
why they must live and eat on
campus when they are short of
money, and it would be cheaper
to live off campus. Dean Brown
clarified the reason for this by
explaining the college policy:

“All students must live and
eat on campus unless there are
extremely unusual circumstan-
ces. It is very difficult to draw
the. lie and say that one per-
son can and the next can’t, so
the overall rule has to be
used."

Dean Brow-n also said that
dates when freshman orientation
classes are to meet again will be
published in the 5&3. Tenta»
tivcly the first meeting for the
second semester is scheduled for
Feb. 9.

Stevens Announces
Open House Plans

announced this week by Prmi»
dent Samuel N. Stevens and
Guillermo Mendoza, chairman of
the science division, for Friday
and Saturday, March 13 and 14,
on the Gi'innell college campus.

Honoring the new science
building, the open house will
feature lectures and symposia
conducted by “name” scientists.

College faculty and student
representatives from a five state
area will be invited on the ﬁrst
day, with an expected 500 high
school teachers and students
from the same Midwestern
states attending the open house
on Saturday. -

The science open house will
follow the pattern of traditional
campus gatherings such as the
annual Writers’ conference, the
annual Guidance conic-once, and
the annual lstitute of Interna-
‘tional Affairs.

Two Prepping Rule
Changes Will'Cui
Length of Hazing

Two major Changes in the
prepping rules, both designed to
shorten the length of prepping
for men have been made by the
c of HP.

Beginning next year, prep caps
will be worn from the first
day of classes until Hell day,
five weeks later. in years when
Homecoming and Hell day con-
flict. prepping wilibc lengthened
to six weeks, i

The second major change is
the date of formal initiation.
Under the new rule, formal my
itiation must be held before
Christmas vacation. The tradir
tional oak paddles must be com-
pleted by the freshman for the
formal ceremony.

Another minor change in the
rules gives the elected freshman
representative a non—voting memr
bership on the house council.

In actions since returning from
Christmas vacation. the council
fined three men for drinking
during the Boar’s Head dinner,
and three others for an inter-
hall ouict hour violation.

Mrs. Pruyn Takes
Job on Committee

Adeline Pruyn (admissions di-
rector) recently accepted apr
pointment to the Uniform Ac»
Ceptance Date committee of the
College Entrance Examination
board of New Yorkl

The question under considera-
tion is whether colleges and!
universities throughout the couna
try should follow the recently
instituted “Ivy League" precede
ure of admitting students on
one date only.

With eight other administra-
tive officials of Colleges and uni
versities, including presidents.
deans, and admissions execu-
tives, Mrs. Pruyn will go to New
York later this month to study
the situation and make recom-
mendations lo the executive

i don’t usually heap praise on
anyone around here because it
took me too long to build up
my reputation as a campus
cynic. Anyhow, i hear too
much of that drivel at Student
Council meetings. However,
there’s a little more at stake
than my reputation this time.

by Bruce Cole

Our little flu epidemic has
taught me that We have a darn

'good system of nurses and in-

firmaries for a college the size
of Grinnell. Last year's measles
wave was a stern test of our
facilities and we came out
pretty well.

Our nurses are efficient with-
out being soft—touches for exam—
dodgcrs and hypochondriacs
(we’ve got ’em) and our
MDJs like Parish, Kbrfmacher,
Porter, and DeMeulenaere have
been able to handle the college
and town responsibility without
a mishap or a complaint,

0n the other side, we need
(in addition to just plain money)
a new library, administration
building, women’s gym, swim»
ming pool, fine arts building,
and student union. one thing
that we don’t need is a student
health center. That’s what we're
getting, though.

Our wellvmeaning philanthro-
pist has decided that we need
a health center more than any-
thing else, despite our apologies.

I don‘t’ suppose there’s much
that anyone can do. When you
have the money I guess you can
do any darn thing you want to
do with it. There’s an old say—
ing that you should never look
a gift horse in the houth. But
i sometimes wonder why mil-
lionaires don’t just build pyras
mids the way the Egyptian
pharoahs did.

_ I hope that this doesn’t sound
like one of Thorstein Veblen’s
tirades on .“conspicuous waste"
because you can never tell who
might read it and maybe she’ll
back out of the Whole deal and
I'll be blamed. Maybe after the
new health center is up we’ll
have another cyclone and it’ll
collapse (apologies to the Weitz
Construction Co.) and we can
build what WE want with the
insurance money, Let us pray.
