But it was the phenomenal
sharpshooting of Dick von Matlr
which really gave Grinnell its
margin of victory. Von Maur
sank ll of 16 attempts from the
field for as per cent and added
two free throws for a total of
24 points, 18 coming in the first
half. The Tutors were ahead at
intermission, 40 to 39.

The two teams were neck

When Bob Dibble fouled out
with "no minutes remaining, the
Panthers rallied from a 55.53
deficit to go ahead once more
59 to 58. But Bob winter sank
two quick field goals and Grille

Last Saturday, South Dakota’s
Coyotes fouled 33 times in em~

flustered the Pioneers for two
quarters, but the Grinneltians

Cagers Seek Fourth Straight Win

The Grinnell cagers return to
conference competition for the
first time in four weeks this
evening by playing host to the
Oles of st. olaf at 3:00 pm in
Danby gym. ,

The Pioneers, fresh from a 69—
66 triumph over hoteshooﬂng
lowa State Teachers college, will
be out to increase their victory
string to four games and to hold
their second place rating in the
Midwest conference.

Although St. Olaf has yet to
win a game in conference play,
they are expected to provide
plenty of competition for Coach
Pfilsch’s crew. Their five confer—
‘ence losses have been by mar»
l gins of from four to nine points
land their over-all lack of height
seems to be the deciding factor.
i Center Noel Olson, forward
lJim Variand, and guard John
‘Guslafson are the mainstays in
the 0125’ attack with each boast-
ing an average of 10 points or
better per game.

3 Grinnell, holding a 75-70 early.
lseason €112!on over tonight's ri-
vals, will stick with virtually the
same lineup that has brought
home three straight wins. Bob
Dibble and Dick von Maur will
man the forwards with Bob
winter at center, and Bud Crowl
and Tom Railsbzck at the guards.

Another regular, Dave stum-
baugh, who missed the last ga'me
because of illness, should be
ready for this game and, if so,
can be expected to add consid~
ei-ahly to the scoring and re-
bound departments.
