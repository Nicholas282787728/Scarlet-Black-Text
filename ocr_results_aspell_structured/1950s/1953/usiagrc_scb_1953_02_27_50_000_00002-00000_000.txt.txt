The current Grinnell College Bulletin states under Gen-
eral Regulations on page 61, “The college reserves the right
to require the temporary suspension or the permanent dis-
missal of any student whose conduct or academic standing
it regards as undesirable, without assigning a definite
reason.”

The Roman historian Tacitus stated, “Power is never
stable When it it boundless.”

my conversations with its critics.
I’ve felt that if Students dem-
onstrated their intention to at-
tend classes within reasonable
limits here would be no Cut rule.
Evidently we haven’t so We have

Lately i‘ve had the idea that
there is something wrong with
my thinking on this subject. i
think I‘ve found what it is. it
you’re interested, keep reading.
If you’re not. don't. For one
:thing, the play, “Andromaque”
is playing at the Arena theatre
and it’s darn good. Don’t miss

I’m going to say.

down at our studies. What does
n't affect our grades doesn’t
motivate most of to conscicn7
tious scholarship. We get our
grades from exams.

Here’s what I’m getting at
with this dazzling logic. Our
protessors are among the iincst
lecturers in the academic world,
Our textbooks are lust like any
other college’s. Our examinations
are almost always straight out
of the textbooks.

One sage observer noted're-
cently that a deaf mute could
earn a ninety average at Grin-
nell. Any person who can read
a textbook and write down what
he remembers can get high
grades. Why go to classes?

That‘s a stupid question, i
know. But it should sound a
lot stupider than it does. if the
classroom lecture could be made
a more significant part of our
education by being included in
lthe material which we are tests
led, this might come about.

I'm making no generalization
because there are many Grin-
nell prois who do include lecture
material on exams There are a
whole lot more who don't, how-
ever. Perhaps a course might be
offered (to the faculty) in. the
preparation of examinations,
particularly now that we are
