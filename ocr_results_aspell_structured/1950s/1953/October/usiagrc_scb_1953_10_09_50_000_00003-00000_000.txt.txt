ders finally did it! They whipped
a surprised Knox outrit, no, on
the Galesburg. lllinois, field last
Saturday. It was the first Pio-
neer victory since the 1951
season, and snapped a ten game
losing strealo

Playing in a steady downs
pour, the l'ainrsoaked Grinnell
backfield waged a ground at-
tack that netued them 55 yards,
while Knox rushed to a total
of 81 yards. \

Finding their footing late in
the first quarter, the Pioneers
charged their way down to the
toureyard line. Tim Walker,
165 lb. left houback from Water-
loo, plunged the remaining
yards for the tally. Dick von
Maur, 190 lb. Davenport end,
converted to round out the
scoring.

Knox dominated play in the
second half. Late in the fourth
quarter they recovered a Grin-
nell fumble on the 19-yard line.
A first down moved them down
to the seven, But a strong Grim
nell defense held them for four
downs and the pioneers took
over on the six»yard line to
clinch the game.

Coach John Pfitsch

was

highly pleased with his team’s_

performance, and hopes that the
Pioneer gridoers came out of
the game realizing that they
don't have to be pushed around
every time they enter the grids

pushing of their own," ended
Pfitsch.

“It’s hard to form an opin-
ion of what St. Olaf will have
in store for Grinnell tomor—
row,“ said Coach E-G. Booth’
who scouted the Oles last
week, “because the SL 0181
mentor decided it unnecesary
to field his first-string lineup"
The usual starters were

Pfitsch strongly believes that

season predictions established by
the league dopesters, and finish
atop the conference standings.
