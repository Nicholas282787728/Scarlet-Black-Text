One Down, One To Go,

Mr. Wall’s committee on the cut rule made a fair and

intelligent report. The first part, dealing with sickness
cuts, has already passed. And the second recommendation
is as good as the first, offeling unlimited cuts to superior,

students.
Superior students are interested students. And interest-

ed students generally go to class, unless the course being

cut is uninteresting and unchallengng.
It’s a good report. Both sections‘ought to be passed.

Spring Sprang

Whether it was revel after the first day of sunshine in
quite a few weeks, a hangover from spring day, or just a
. burst of enthusiasm in expectation of the summer holidays
to come, the Grinnell men showed the wrong colors last

Wednesday night.

Throwing firecrackers, water, or anything else just
doesn’t seem to be the right way to greet anyone, the
police, fire department, or the Dean of Men.

Maybe the burning chair wouldn’t have hurt anything.
Possibly the bonfire could be termed a private party. The

plain facts are that there was a fire, and the fire depart-

ment was called. Once they got there, they should have
received no interference, at least, and complete coopera-
tion, at most.

Labor Department
Tells Graduates'
,Job Opportunities

“The economy of the United
States is operating at extremely
‘hlgh levels. Employment records
are established nearly every
month, . Consequently, the em~
ployment outlook for college
graduates this year is excellent,"
Martin P. Durkin, United States
Secretary of Labor, announced
recently in a labor department
bulletin.

In the science fields, excellent
opportunities are reported main—
ly because of the defense pro-
gram and the number of college

graduates entering the armed
forces. .

 

With over a million addi-
children entering ele-
mental-y schools this fall, the
demand for elementary school
teachers is expected to be
greater for 1953-54 than for
1952-53. At the high school
level the supply dropped sig-
nificantly each year since 1950
and many vacancies exist in
such fields as home econonr
its, girls’ physical education,
and certain physical sciences.

“The United states Civil Ser-
vice commission reports thot the
pressing need of federal agencies
are in scientific and technical
positions such as engineer, phy—
sisist, chemist, and mathemati-
clan," Durkin also stated.

tional

information about examinas
tions currently open may be ob-
tained from the college place
ment office, from civil Service
commission offices, and from
post offices.

ing college graduates trained

At last night’s Honor G
banquet. a new Grinnell tradi-
tion was inaugurated and i
think it may become something
that many of us will remem-
ber in future years. Lin Stacey
was awarded the first David
Theophllus Memorial trophy for
outstanding performance, leader
ship, and a healthy attitude on
the athletic field.

An award like this will he
made to an outstanding senior
athlete each year or as long as
the coaching staff thinks there
is an eligible and deserving
man. This is the first time i
can remember that an athlete
has been openly honored at
Grinnell for being merely a good
athlete although it would seem
that 107 years is long enough
for a college to realize the imr
portance of a flourishing ath-
letic program.

The Honor G is probably
the richest organization on the
campus with the possible ex»
ception of the Air Force. They
also have the responsibility of
offering well coordinated young
men the encouragement of
sweaters, jackets, and blankets,
for their services in the various
sports. it’s probably the only
encouragement they get.

The members or Honor G
don’t always take their respon-
sibilities too Seriously. They
still owe Sigma Delta Chi about
$20 for last year’s football (and
homecoming) programs which
are edited and printed by Sigma
Delta Chi so that Honor G
can get fat on the profits.

Still, if you don’t expect too

.much of the Honor G it does

actually come up with a good
idea now and then and the
is one that
it should hang on to, the way
it hangs onto money,
