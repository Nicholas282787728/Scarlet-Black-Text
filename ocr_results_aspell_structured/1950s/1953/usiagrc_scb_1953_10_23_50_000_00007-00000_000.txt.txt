During the second semester,l
which begins Monday, February

sumption seems to be that SILI»
dents actually dul‘i't want. a
higher education. Most Schools
adopi the attitude that Students
have to be forced to attend
class, and fail or reduce the
grades of those with a certain
number of absences. (Let us

hasten to add tnat this attitude
is not complctely unjustified in
many cases.)

The Yale plan assumes a wills
ing and self—reliant student
body. it makes attendance at
lecture courses entirely option-
al, allowing each student to de-
cide on his own whether the
lecturer or his material has
value to him. The only classes
where attendance would be man.
datory would be the supple.
mentary 75—minute discussion
classes held once a week for
each course.

A kcy feature of this revised
course system is the comprer
hensive general examination.
Students would he required to
undergo a test of their absorbed
knowledge over a full {waryear
period, rather than at the end
of each semester as at present.

We think this is a develop-
ment that could well be ex-
tended to more and more
Schools. The testing procedures
of many of our colleges and
universities frequently do no
more than emphasize short term
feats of memory. Rather than
aiming at basic understanding,
”cram" sessions have oecoric
standard practice for most stus
dents, with the object of star—
ing up enough facts to last
through an examination,

Yale's proposed changes in
the mechanics of education are
planned in the context of a libs
eral curriculum. Yale proposes
to give its students a variety
of course work ranging from
natural science and mathematics,
to literature, music, art and
"training subjects" English
grammar, foreign languages and
R. o. T. c.

At a time when the trend is
increasingly ’ toward ”trade"
subjects. the Yale plan repre-
sents a welcome emphasis on
general education as well as an
encouraging willingness tolchal-
lenge our traditional concepts
of college teaching.

“An ultimatum from the rail<.
road asking the students to
cease and desist their damage on
the right of way has come to'
my office." This was the state-
ment issued by Dean of Mali”
Henry A. Brown in regard to’
the damage of right of way'
signs and insulators on the
main line of the M and st. L
railroad cutting through the
campus. '

)‘If anyone is caught, discipline
any action will be taken by the
college and the railroad, It’s a
criminal oﬂense and the line is
really mad," added Dean Brown‘.

He also stressed the need for
scholarship 1 students who aie
going to work second semester
to fill out the necessary work
applications in his office as
soon as possible. This is done
so the office will know jusl:
what kind of work the applicant
will be able to do.

Another point brought up by
the Dean was that the student
organizations committee must
have from all organizations a

list of its members and an up
to date copy of its constitution
before the above committee can
approve the central committee of
the Student Council’s recom-
mendations for allocation of se-
mester fees.

Campus organizations are also
requested to turn in lists of
officers to the student Organi
zations committee, through the‘
Dean of Men's office, immediatev
ly. .

Any man interested in workf
ing in a downtown store on Sat:
urday afternoonsis to apply at
Dean Brown’s office.

Student time slips are due
kylondxy in the Dean of Men’s

‘fflce in order to be included
in the November payroll.

Finally, Brown wanted to re—
mind men students that the
deadline for applications for the
selective service examinations is
November 2, Application blanks
are available in his office. _
