allrtlme Grinnell scoring record for the most points scored by two
teams In one basketball game. The 95-93 total of 188 points just

mouth here last Feb. 7.

At the me time the cagers extended their string of Consecu—
tive ihome Victories to 12 games. This streak started with a 57.49

'Dou'ble Overtime Decision Over Kohawks is Third
Win in Initial Drive To Conference Championship

—%‘ by Roger Yost
Grinnell's basketball squad moved into first plate in the W-

west conference last night, when it toppled Coe's unbeaten cage
. team in a double-overtime battle, 95.93, in Darby gym. All-Confer-
‘ence center Bob Winter paced the Pioneer kit-tack by dumping in

29 points, in a game that saw eight players benched via che foul
route, and another of Grimell’s Starting five, Bud Crowl, with-

crew employ a full court press,‘

The victory was Grinnell's
third straight in league compe—
.iiiicn, having previously defeat-l

Both contacts last week were
not decided until the final
buzzer exhausted play, with the
Pioneer five enforcing an un-
penetmble stall on each occa-
sion.

The Pioneer quintet entered
last night's game minus the
services of two of their top
tally—makers, Dick von Maur
and Tom nailsback. Before

a game total of 25 points, 13
coming in the 10 minutes of
extra play. Mahon, who was
second high for the Kohawks
with 19, cut the cords on more
than 60 percent of his tosses.
Coe’s supposedly dangerous cen—
ter, 6.3 Jack Fulton, was
limited to 13 points by the
Grinncll defense, vbefore he
fouled out midway through the
fourth period.

In their clash with St Olaf's
Lions, who entered the, contest
with five straight wins, the
Pioneers held a lead of 16
points at fha inlennission, only
to be tied and temporarily
passed in the final quarter of
play. A field goal and free
throw by Bob Landis. and four
charity tosses by Bud Crowl
sewed up the game in the final
minutes of play.

Grinnell maintained a lead
over Carleton throughout
their first league meeting,
until the Carls, sparked by
the deadly shooting of for.
ward Bob Buis, edged ahead
of the Pioneers 62-61 with a\
minute and 45 seconds left.
Dick von Maur was one of
the late game heroes along
with Musser and Crawl, that
allowed the locals to trip up
the earls.

During the battle with one
Knights, Coach John Pfitsch
found what he had been seardl»
ing for since the squad suﬁfered
a defeat from Central three
weeks ago, and that is a “fifth"

in his first dose of varsity com-
petition, proved worthy of one
