Trustees Meel To Hear Students
Tell Campus Attitudes, Problem

A committee on social life of
the Board of Trustees met Wed,
nesday with groups of studentsi
in’ Main drawing room. At
noon the committee met with
the deans and some faculty
members.

The Eommittee, John Norris,
chairman, Rudolph Weitz, preSa
ident of the Board of Trustees,
Mrs. Leonard Hurtz, trustee,
met with the League Board, c
of HP. and students from the
freshman, sophomore, and jun-
ior classes in an effort to “learn
more about student attitudes

,and opinions.“ Also present at
the conference: was Robert Eud-
long of St. Louis, a Gi-innell
alumnus. ~ -

ings, which ran from 9 am. to
6 - ,m., the committee Said: “The
end objective is to. make Grin-
nell more attractive to high
school graduates. By finding
Student opinion We are better
able to sell Grinnell. .

”We got some very Construc-

’tlve criticism from some very
intelligent students. We are in
,a better position to guide basic
policies. We have learned much
about Grinnrell. It was a Very
worthwhile day."

. Alf Jahnsen, president of the
c of HP, said “The trustee's
meeting with the students of
the college is a gratifying sign
of the school's progressivcness.
From past experience we can
expect quick results if they find
there is any area in which they
can help us."

Norm Cohen, social coordina-
tor, who met with the trustees
with the c or HP at 10 am.
stated that ”I think that such
conferences will prove to be a
benefit to Grinnell only if the
participants are able to realize
the problems confronting the
different groups concerned with
making Grinnell a more success-
ful college.

“My personal opinion was that
one or’ two members of the
committee seemed to have form-
ed a bias concerning many of
the questions which they asked
and ,we answered. ‘

“It! am correct in my assump»
tiDn, I do not feel that there
will be any benEfit derived
from yesterday’s confcrsnce. l
sincerely hope i am wrong."

meeting with the trustees was
a Very worthwhile thing, since
it enabled them to see Grin-
nell’s problems through the
eyes of the students and faculty.
The meetings were very suc—
cessful," she said.

This is the first time that a
committee of the Board of Trus-
tees has met with large student
groups. Up to this. year, the
Board met regularly twice a
year, at Homecoming and at
Commencement. Other commit-
tees of the board are planning
to meet with students and fac—
ulty.

'Brown Reorganizes
Job Requirements

A new system for student
employment will begin with the
second semester as a result of
the present shortage of jobs,
Dean of Men Henry A, Brown
said Wednesday.

Residence on campus, main-
tainanco of u 72 grade aver-
age, and remaining in good
standing throughout the col—
lege will be required of all
job-holders.

All student employees will be
checked to determine their acr
tual need for a job.

Also, seniors are going to be
discouraged from wor 'ng, be-
cause a student’s last semester
is unusually busy with job in-
terviews, graduate record examr
inations, comprehensives, and
honors work.

Student employment checks
will not be ready until Saturday
due to the fact that a number of
time sheets were not turned in
before vacation, thus holding up
all pay checks.

In order to avoid this in the
future, time sheets will be due
20th or each month with the
26th as a final deadline. It
a Student does not turn his

 

will have to wait until the
l iollowiiig month to receive his
i chock.

; Dean Brown wishes to remind
all foreign students that they
'must fill out a registration blank
,by Jan. 31 or face deportation
from this country. This is re
louired under the McCarran Im-
migration act.

I've found January to be a
rotten month in other years. The
annual thaw usually comes in
January. it did this year, Just
as I’d sold Carl Runge on the
idea of letting me use his icer
skates. By the time the Scooter
had decided to make the big
sacrifice there was no longer-
any ice.

Some oi us in Cowles hall
tried to make January a bit
gayer by challenging Gates to
a hockey game, I can remember
when it wasn't necessary to
challenge Gates to anything but
that was the old Gates, The
new Gates doesn’t. play games;
]they occupy themselves singing
,songs back and forth to south
Younker. ‘Nothing wrong with
that, I guess

The worst thing about January
is the new cars. All the new
models come out just about now
and the dealers in town are
very nice about letting you look
them over. However, a strange
feeling came over me when i on-
tered one of their showrooms. it
was as if i was being watched.
The salesman acted very-’non-
choiant about the whole thing
-but you could see that he was
all tensed up. I suppose that
selling a car to a student must
be a lot like selling whiskey to
in ians.

January is also the monthdur-
ing which bowl games are hash-
ed over. In the past this has
been an unpleasant business for
me but I'm happy to report
that such was not the case in
1953. Even Harvey Golden, who

by Bruce Cole

four year sat beside me -in Pasadena as i

watched the Southern California
Trojans blast the Badgers right
off the field, was rather mum
about the game. i think this was
the first time that “mum” ever
meant anything other than a
deodorant or a brand of cham-
pagne in connection with Big
Harv. ‘

Another sad thing about Jan-

l

on the counseling. Sometimes iluary is that the mid-year grad-

Letters

To the Editor:

According to the Bible, “Then
God said ‘Let there be lightz'
and there was light; and God
saw that the light was good."
However it appears that there
is an even stronger power, for
the administration has decreed
darkness at the women’s gym
and there is utter darkness.

The reason for my concern
is the Grinnell tennis team.
Through a minor miracle the
completely unsubsidized tcnnis
team, turnishing its own rackets,
strings, and oftentimes balls,
brought Grinnell its first con-
ference championship m any
sport in over five years.

,Part oi the reason for this
success was the fact that the
team members were willing to
sacrifice their time and practice
at night during the winter in
the women’s gym. Grinnell no
longer demands this sacrifice, in
tact it no longer will even give
us the gym.

Now if electricity must be
saved, I'm sure the men at
Grinneu will be willing to sac-
rifice lights at open houses. Not
letting the tennis team practice
at night.in the women’s gym to
save on electricity is a bit like
cutting out candle~light vespcrs
to save on candles,

Given half a chance, the team
feels it can bring Grinnell
another championship. We'd need
a little light on the subject first.

Harry Young

uates leave us during it. It’s
going to take us a long time to
get used to the fact that Rick
Fledorowicz, Merle Fischlowitz,
Jack Gillbert, Phil Hartsock,
King-Ming “Jim” Hsu, Leo Jen~
sen, and Mike Litka, aren't go—
ing to be around any more.
“Letters to the editor" just isn’t
going to be the same, and the
Pitch game in Cowles clu‘broom
will be a lot less spirited with
the loss of Jack, Mike and Jim.

One more January curse is
final exams. I saved that for
last for dramatic effect. Some
journalists like a “kick-invthe-
teeth” ending and I thought I’d
try it out.
