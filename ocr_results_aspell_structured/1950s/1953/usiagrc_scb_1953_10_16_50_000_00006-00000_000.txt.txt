League Poll Reveals Sluclen‘ls

Vague Aboul' F

A poll taken this week by
the League of Women Voters on
the general knowledge 03f Grin-
nell students about the United
Nations showed that most stud-
ents have only a vague idea of
the nature and functions of the
UN and its agencies.

About twenty percent of the
student body was polled, but
the results were announced in
general terms, rather than exact
figures because the judgement
of the questioner was used to
determine the correctness or
wrongness of the answers; and
because the poll was not meant
to be exact, but rather a general
indication of students’ awareness
of the UN,

Slightly over onerthird oi
the students gave the correct
answer to the question “Whth
is the purpose of the UN'.’",
another third gave half the
required answer, and the re—
mainder were not able to give
any answer at all. A correct
answer to this question in»
volved mention of the main-
tenance of peace and security
and the solution oi economic,
cultural and social problems.
Ten percent gave the correct

number of 60 to the question

on the number of member na- ,

tions.’ About tWO‘hl'l‘ll'dS of the
incorrect answers lay between
50 and 60, but'bhe range of
answers fell. between 12 and 100-

Nearly all interviewed Stud-
ents answered correctly that not
Bill nations belonged to the UN.

Mada/me Pandit of India Was
cdrtectly named by 15 percent
of those asked t0 name the
President Of the UN, and slight-
ly under twenty percent named
Dag Hammerskjolld correctly as
the Secretary-General,

To the question “What is the
difference in membership and
pllnwse 0f the General Assert-l»

bly and the Security Council,“
most peisons interviewed were
Vague. Nearly all grasped the
membership difference, al-

' thallgh many knew only that
the Security Council was
small; and about titty percent
were able to make the general
distinction in functions.

All members of the UN are
members of the General As—
Semlbly, with one vote each. Thel
Security Council is made up of
eleven members, five permanr
ent (United states, Britain,l
France, Nationalist China, and
Soviet Russia), and six nonpar—
manent members elected by the
General Assembly.

Generally, the Council is Con-
cerned with meeting threats to
peace, and is the only agency
empowered to use direct force;

while the Assembly‘s function
is to lay basic policy, act as a
world rcrurn, and direct overall
activities.

Approximately one—third of the
students could state that there
are twelve specialized agencies
of the UN, set up by the Econ-
omic and Social Council to
carry out its work; and another
one-fourth could name an ex—
ample, sudh as UNESCO, the
international Bank, and the in.
