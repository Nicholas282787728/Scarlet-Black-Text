Once Upon a Time

Once upon a time there was a college. It had a fac-
'ulty, a student body, and a group of buildings where they
met, There was also an administration, located in a spiked
castle on a nearby hill,

The college was good, too. Everyone was justly proud
of its rating in the national magazine, “Senorita.” Without
boasting much, they could say they were smarter, better—
fed, and more radical than almost any other college around.

But there came a crisis. A communique from the spiked
castle announced that the best of all possible colleges was
faced with a deficit. Judicious cuts would be necessary
in faculty, for instance. At the same time, a current for-
eign war threatened to diminish the number of students

Now what is a college without a faculty or student
body? Students became concerned. Clearly, there were two
things to do: keep un the faculty at all costs; and active—
ly solicit students to come.

This could be a fa y tale, but it isn’t. We wish it were.
This is the present situation that Gl’inllell—VVEifllld our»
selves in.

While we aren’t in a position to decide on the school’s
policy concerning faculty, we can help the school in its
search for students. During spring- vacation we can tell in-
terested high school students about Grinnell. This is no
charity job for the admissions office; it is responsible
concern for the college we chose to attend ourselves.

In good fairy tale tradition, we should end, “And every-
one lived happily forever after." Well, fairy tales HAVE
come true.

Correction

Last week we printed an editorial asking the students
to cooperate with President Samuel N. Stevens as he had
intimated to us that he wollld be most willing to answer
frankly at the student-faculty coffee hour all questions con-
cerning the general welfare of the college.

It has come to our attention that President Stevens ill
answering questions put to him about the expected reduc-
tions in the faculty definitely stated that certain depart-
ments would not be affected by the proposed cuts. We felt
this was the most gratifying comment to come from the
whole session. It is undoubtedly true that certain students
who were present at the meeting and who were contemplat—
ing. leaving Gl'innell not for social reasons bllt because of
rumors of the proposed cuts of professoss in their respec—
tive majors, were put at ease. It seemed that the session
was a success.

Saturday President Stevens delivered a farewell ad-
dress to a combined assemblage of the faculty and student
leaders at which he reaffirmed the fact that Grinnell was
an academic leader among Iowa and midwest colleges and
he hopefully entrusted the welfare of the college to those
present.

Monday students and faculty were astounded to learn
of faculty cuts in one of the departments which President
Stevens had so strongly asserted would remain the same,

\Ve‘are frank to admit that this sudden change in the
picture his left us in the dark. There is little doubt that
such administrative policy can do little to promote the
general welfare of the college. If President Stevens were
here we feel certain that he would sense the gen al air of
uneasiness which we have perceived on campus since Molt
day. .

We should like to be able to believe the administration
when they discuss their policies with us and yet . . . Must
we again utter the continual hue and cry of the Gl‘illlleli
student, “All We want to know is where we stand!"

To the editor:

Bruce Cole’s column has al-
ways been one of inlcrcsi roi-
inc. Sonic oi his efforts have
even been amusing at iiincs.
However, my reactions to last
week’s wanderings were two
fold: disgust and sympathy Disc;
giisi at the S&B’s waste of goodi
newsprint and sympathy for
Cole. Certainly, the only person,
who gained h-om the column in
question was the author, It did
add more column inches to hisl
grand total than he has pickedi
up for several weeh .

Each person mentioned in
Cole's column (with the excEp-f
iioii of himscli) was elected to

Referring to Cole’s collm‘m‘
again. it could have been writ-i

represents. l
