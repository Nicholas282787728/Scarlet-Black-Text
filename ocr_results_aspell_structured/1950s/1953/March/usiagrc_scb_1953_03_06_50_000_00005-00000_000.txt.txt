Baskeleers Fall on Road Again;
Tumble Before Lawrence, Ripon

Grinnell’s cagers ended their
,1952453 season on a disastrous
note last weekend by dropping
games at Lawrencep76e75, on
Friday and then falling at Ripon
the next night, 96-84. l

The double defeat gave the
Pioneers three setbacks in their
last four games and shoved
them into fourth place in the
Midwest conference standings
behind Cornell, Carleton, and
Lawrence, in that order.

Grinnell finished its confer-
-ence season with a 7-5 mark:
land can still move into third
lspot in the league if Lawrence
loses to Carleton or St. Olaf
this weekend in Minnesota. The
Pioneers season record ended
