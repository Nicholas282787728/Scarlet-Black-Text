A campus cynic once told me
that there were two kinds oi
w iters: “those who had some-
thing to say but couoldn’t write.
and those who could write but‘
had nothing to say.” (Maybe.
he was right. but conformity
has the darnedest habit oi dull-
ing a good angle, and aren't all
collogians campus cynics most
or the time?)

But cynicism is so much iuni
Let me try it once. “There are

-From The President

Fifty years from now many of you will return to th'
campus and remember with no alg’ic longing the es
perienees you are about to enjo For a little wlille the
College will seem to you to be like the New Englander's
idea of God 7 a kind of an oblong bhll: But it will not be
many days before things and people and programs begin
to take on meaning. ~ _

For those of yoil who have been this way before the
College is a familiar place with dearly loved associations
alid with opportunities beyond telling: For the new student
it is an environment in which each young man and woman
may try new wings of freedom.

Through the years those who have administered the
College created the Grinnell community. In Some ways it is
all arbitrary community. It has its own standards for
citizenship and its own traditions which make it a full lili-
man environment. All of you, whether new students or old
will leave something here as well as take something
from this college. May this leaving and taking be a source
01' growth and blessing to all of you and an added power
to the College.
