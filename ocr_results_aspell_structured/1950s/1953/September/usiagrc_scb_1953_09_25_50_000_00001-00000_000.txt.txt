Insurance Offered
On Voluntary Basis

Health and accident insurance
is available this year on a vol~
untary basis to any Grinnell
student, according to
Neveln, Comptroller.

All students participating in
intro—mural or intercollegiate
athletics are required to have
this or some other kind of so
cident insurance, however,

The policy, costing $15 a year
or $5.50 a semester. is the same
as the one which. covered each
student last year and was in.
cludcd in the semester fee, it
takes care of all costs up to
$500 arising from an accidental
injury and covers hospital room
and care charges at so a day
during illness.

The insurance may be pure
chased Friday and Saturday at
registration or through the Ram-
sey insurance Agency in Grin-
nell. Each student cu’ming
through the registration line

An innovation in the New
Student Days schedule this year;
was the exchange of social
groups at dinners

Numbered groups met with
different opposite groups at
each dinner, so that freshmen
and transfer students met
more of their classmates.

Another new idea was the

to pay full tuition and fees at

4%. . 3

For changes in registration,
course cards not used are to

New Course Plan,
Letter Grading
To Go Into Effect

A new grading system and
course plan for Grinnell will
go into effect this semester.

Replacing the former numer-
ical grades will be letter grades
of A (superior), B (above'aver-
age), 0 (average), D (poor, but
passing). and F (failure). In
addition, the symbols I, WP,
and WF will indicate incom-
plete work, withdrawal from a
class while passing, and with-
drawal from a course while
failing, respectively.

The new course plan in-
cludes both three and four
hour cnurses. Generally, the
courses specifically required
for graduation will remain
four hour courses, while
others will be changed to
three. 3

In determining averages un-
der the new grading system the
letters will be given numbezs
as follows. A. 4; B, a; C, 2; D,
1; and F, 0. Courses will be
weighted according to the num-

ber of hours credit given.

The field of concentration is
now defined as 30 hours. The
number of courses for distribu-
tion requirements will remain
constant, so therefore, the num-
ber of hours will total. less
than last year.

Total hour reauirement for
graduation is 124, including
phvsicnl education and health
education. The normal class
loud paid for one semester
will be 12-17 hours.

Men participating in the .
ROTC program may take over
1’7 hours work at no additional

will be required of veterans ab .
