by Hull Pothoval

Tomorrow afternoon
gridders will don the scarlet and
black for the last time. These
seniors will .be out to finish their

they accomplish this they will
also have been instrumental in
giving Grinnell one of its best
- id records in many years. 4

Co-captain Don Hager will
finish out three years of varsity
competition when he mans his
fullback post for tomorrow’s
.game. This has undoubtedly
been Don's best year on the grid—

’ground‘ gainer and the one that
is counted on when those yards
are really needed, Don is one of
two married men on the squad
and hails from Marshalltovm.

Ran Frank

Another three year veteran
and the other fro-captain is
guard Ron Frank. Last year Ron
was honored‘ with a first team
all conference berth and has a
good chance to repeat this year.

rHis aggressive play on (both of.
fense and defense has made R‘Dn
gone of the important cogs in
this year’s machine. Ron is from
KChicago.

Wally Stevens

Wally Stevens has been a
steady perfmner at his center,
post for the past three years and,

Bob played his first year of four

himself to be an exceptional
passer. The switch to one platoon
football hindered Bob this year
because of his inexperience on
defense, but he has made a

Marv Clein

Injuries have hampered half»
back Mary Clein’s action this.
year but if he is in tdp condition
he can be counted on for some
very dependable service tomor-

‘best defensive lmen.

Bob Kisser

Bob Risser. primarily a de-
fensiv'e end, also has had to
switch to the one platoon sy—
stem and has come through in
fine style by grabbing two
touchdown passes, one last week;
and one against Wabash.

George Baker

The final senior on the team,
tackle George Baker, will prob-
ably not be suited up for the
game since a series of brain cons
cussions have limited his ser-
vice this year and kept him out
of the Monmouth game altogeth-

Injuries Hamper Grinnell

, Grinnell will enter the game
‘in its poorest physical shape of
the season. Co-captains Ron
Frank and Dave Norris. stal-
‘wart guards, will both be ham.

have to rely on sophomore
guards along with junior letter—
man Steve McCormick.

Neither of Pfltsch’s right half—
,backs will be in top shape as
.Marv Cleln became ill during
lthe week and Tim Walker is
still suffering from a bad leg
which kept him out of the Mon.
mouth game last week.

Grinnell will enter the game
a definite underdog. Lawrence,
which tied Coe last week. beat
the Pioneers in the initial game
iof the season. 25.0. But the
.scrappy Grinnell squad has
come a. long way since then
and. as Coach Pfitseh says,
anything can happen out there
tomorrow.

Honor 6 Members

To Enforce Rules

The proposal that Honor G
members who do not conform to '
training rules during their ath-
letic season be suspended from
the club was informally dis-
cussed and later put into the
form of a motion at a meeting
of the organization held on
Wednesday night.

Purpose of the move would
be strengthening of Honor G, by
giving it a more definite plat—
form.

A swimming party for mem-
bers and their dates has been
planned for Thursday. Novem-
ber 19. The organization also
discussed initiation week for
new members which is tenta-
tively scheduled to begin De»
camber 4 and be climaxed with
a final initiation ceremony on
