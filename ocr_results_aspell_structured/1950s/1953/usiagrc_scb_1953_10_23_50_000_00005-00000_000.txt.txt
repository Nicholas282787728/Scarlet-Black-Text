While the Pioneers were 3hr
sorblng a 33-12 setback at that
hands of Wabash College last
week, the Rams, inspired by a

homecoming crowd of 3,500, led
the Cue college representatives

third quarter, at which time

Coach John Pittsch holds
more respect ior the Rams
than their last place percent
age would lead one to believe.
The Grinnell varsity mentor
rorsees a close contest tomor—
row, with the team securing
the greater number of breaks
wiiniing. Last year the Core
nell troop whipped Grinnell
15-6.

Under the tutelage. of their
newly acquired coach, Jim Dut-
cher, the Rams fielded a straight
“T" lormation, with their pass—
ing and running games of equal
lstrength. ln last week’s tilt with
the Kohawks, the Rams netted
136 yards on the ground, and
garnered 134 through the air.
