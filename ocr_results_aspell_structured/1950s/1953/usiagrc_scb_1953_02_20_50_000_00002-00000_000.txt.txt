To the editor:
After being batted back and forth all year, the stu—

dent musical llris finally decided to stand on its O\\'l‘l feet.
It will be four years old this spring, and is determined to
make its life at Grillllell successful.

This year the Gndabouts' sponsored show may be a
musical revue, regressing back to the style of “Up A Tree,”
which was the first student musical given. This type of

group has tentatively decided to produce a revue type show.

A brilliant showing was made last weekend by the
Gl‘innell debate team, which serves to remind us what a
wonderful job Nicholas Cripe has done at Grinnell this year.

Organization of an intramural debate tournament was
the first step, and with the enthusiasm stirred up by that
successful venture, he was able to form a real varsity den
bate team. It is not only refreshing to see someone carry»
thru with an idea, but also enlightening to find out that

I like it. I think it's fair.
Sally Shirk, Loose hall jun-

but they give you more time to
work. I hate to study for them.
Ron Stanger, Rawson junior:
In everything but your major
you shouldn't have two hour

are good. They prepare you for
comps. '
Marcia Donsker, Haines soph~

then let’s have them for two

The above question was sub»

Magazine Publishes

ITruesclale's Arlicle

An article by John Truss-
dale (physical education) has
been published in the Decem~
ber issue of the State journal of
the lowa Association for Health,
Physical Education, and Rec-re-
ation.

In his article, “Counseling in
physical Education and Athlet—
icS,” Truesdale asserted that
“men and women teachers in
physical education, athletics, and
recreation have an unusual op-
portunity to serve the youth
of the country as counselors.

”Physical education and ath—
lerIicS belong in education only
if the experiences contained in
the physical activity program
make a contribution to the re»
alization of the purpose of edu-
cation. Leaders in» the physical
activity programs may be con-
Sidered to be educators only to
the extent that they integrate
their teaching techniques with
the prevailing educational meth-
odS,” he said.

l Our little quartet began in the
old days when allenight sessions
after ladies’ hours were quite
commonplace. We had a little
trouble getting under way this
season due to recently imposed
lprogram of abstinence which has
lbeen instituted in the men’s
malls. It’s not that we play bet
‘ter when We are intoxicated but
the rest of Cowles hall finds our
practice Sessions much more tol-
erable if they are. We solved
that problem by inviting the ob
jectors to join us at such harm-
les devices as the washboard and
the mandolin. They tire fast. We
don’t.

Our book how includes about
a dozen numbers ranging from
“Stand Up for Jesus” to “Since
My Best Gal Let Me Down." We
,have “Royal Garden Blues” just
about ready if 1 can ever master
a certain difficult cadenza. The
third finger on my left hen-’1
keeps cramping up on me.

We play in the keys of c and
E. Hammy likes F better so
i’that’s where we usually play.
lHe’s the temperamental member
of our group. Once we had to
lock Knox Porter out of the
clubroom because his mandolin
playing was upsetting Banjo Bill.

The only one of us who seems
to know what’s going on is
Mansic. He is a specialist at in-
troductions. HE’S such a Specials
ist that none of the rest of us
know what song he’s introducing
and that’s why we are frequent-
ly six or seven bars late in join-
ing him. Smokie doesn’t have
much trouble but that‘s because
he didn’t join us until we were
polished performers. ’

There are other bands on cam.
pus and 1 shall say nothing to
discourage them. 1m in favor
of aesthetes, even at the most
amateur level. It’s a Shame that
some of these less accomplished
groups don’t have Sense enough
to keep their recitals private.
This overzealousness and impa»
tience to be heard by an audi-
ence often damages the reputae
tion of fine music. Hammy,
Smokie, Mansie, and Creolle
(me) are doing what they can
to rectify this damcgc.
