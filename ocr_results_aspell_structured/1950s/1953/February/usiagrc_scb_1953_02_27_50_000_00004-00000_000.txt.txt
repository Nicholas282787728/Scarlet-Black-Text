Slants on Sports

by George Simon

While big Bob Winter and his teammates have been grab-
bing all the big headlines, and most of the attention of Gi-inneil
fans, the Pioneer tankers have quietly but convincingly been prov-
ing to their coach and to the record hook, that they are probably
the greatest swimming team Grinneli has ever had.

Whereas the once high flying cage machine has crashed to
earth. these proteges of lrv Simone continue to splash wave
after wave of defeat on their opponents.

And despite the mouriiful cry of many supposedly competent
observers that Carleton will romp to another conference crown,
Coach Simone is sure that the meet at Northiield, Minn., next
weekend will be “very close.” His boys aie Carleton’s biggest
worry, and rightly so.

The brightest Pioneer hope is Wally Bragdon, who has an
excellent chance to cop both the 200 yd, hack stroke and the
120 yd. individual medleyiand in record time, at that.

Only records made in the conference meet go into the league
record books, but Bragdon last week unofficially broke the con—

felerlce mark in the 200 While beating Anderson of Knox, the:
present record holder. Wally’s time was 2.23.7, almost three sec-

onds under Anderson's best mark of 2:26.13. 1

In the 120 yd. medley which will he swuin in this year’s meet
for the first time in conference history, Bragcloii has chalked up
better times than any conference swimmer he has faced.

And then there's Pete Vassiiakos, who has beaten Bragdon
in both events on several occasions, and could do it again, tiius
giving Crinneil H in the conference battle in either event.

Howie Runyon has lost only to Cal'leton’s Eggers in the
so and 100 yd. free style, both by slim margins, and might pos-
sibly edge the speedy Carl next week.

Both‘Barry Lawrence and Bob Ross can finish high among
the leaders in the 440 and 220 yd. freestyle events, but st. ()1an
Howie Cedarblade, wiio wlll swim here tomorrow, looks like a
sure bet to take the distance swims.

Bill Heina has downed all but Fleming of Knox in diving
competition and could take second in the Midwest meet.

Altogether, Simone’s present swimmers have broken five of
the ten Crinnell varsity records of all time, and three more
are in constant danger of falling by the wayside.

Finally, the most amazing thing about this outfit is that only
two of its members are seniors, Captain Ross and breast stroker
An‘dy Has‘sopulosi

Grinnell’s frosh swimmers will compete in the Midwest con»
ference freshman telegraphic meet next Monday, and I predict
that they'll take the crown.

The yearling trio of Tom Hejna, Harold Matheson, and Joel
stubbs, swimming an exhibition last Saturday, unofficially lowered
the varsity conference 300 yd. medley mark from 3:101; to 3:09.7
in a superb effort. Next week Doug Bannister will replace Stubhs,
while Joel seeks victory in the sprint freestyle events. Hejna and
Matheson should bring hack triumphs in the 200 yd. backstroke
and 200 yd. breaststroke, respectively,

No, Carleton won't have an easy time in next week’s varsity
meet, or next year, These Pioneers are tough now, and they‘re
getting tougher all the time.

Coe Edges Grinnell
To Kill Tilleﬂopes

The last flame of hope for a

Grinncll basketball champion.
lsl’lip flickered momentarily and
then died out last Friday as
,Coe's scheming Kohawks used
‘an unbreakable 12 minute stall
to edge the Pioneers, 69-66, at
Cedar Rapids. _
, With Grinneii leading, 53 to
‘51, midway through the third
quarter, Coe's big Jack Fulton
temporarily retired to the bench
iwlth four fouls, and most Grin-
nell fans thought the game was
in the bag.

But the Kohavvks immcd.

Crinnell fouls quickly moved
Coe into a 54.53 third quarter
lead, but the Pioneers tied the
game with three minutes to go,
64-64. Coe continued to stall
while Grinnell continued to fool,
and the Kohawks pushed their
lead to 69454, before Tom Rails»
back drove the entire length of
the floor unmolested to score a
final layup shot as the game
ended.
