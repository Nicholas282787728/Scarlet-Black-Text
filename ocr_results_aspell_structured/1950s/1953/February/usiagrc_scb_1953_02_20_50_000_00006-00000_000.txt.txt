at midnight, and carry on
through the following Saturday.

in the later part of the week
before the convention. special,
housemeetings will be held at‘

which time convention delegates;L

will be elected. One delegatE is
apportioned for every four mem-
bers of the house. However, ifr
less than on per cent of the
hall’s membership attends this
hcusemeeting, delegates are ape
portioned on the basis or one
delegate for every four members
attending.

At a housemeeting following
the election of delegates, the
house will vote as to their pub
erence between the presidential
candidates, Delegates will then-
be instructed as to which of
the candidates they are to castl
their vote for according to the:
proportion of the house voting
for each candidate. ‘

The first hallot taken at the|
convention will be done on this;
instructed basis. in subsequent
ballots, a delegate may vote for
whichever candidate he chooses,
This procedure continues until”
two candidates receive 35 per
cent of the vote of the delegates.

The week end then consists
of a frantic realligning of votes
and blocs, and on Monday, the
entire student body selects be-
tween the two surviving Candi-
dates. ‘ l

because he has a job. the loser

is happy because he doesn’t.

The only people in the whole
affair who have to take the
thing at least partially seriously
are the members of the election
board. in their hands is the con-
rol and performance of the
whole show. They may be identir
fied during the next week by a
general noncommital and neutral
attitude. This year the board
consists of Jack Reddan, Dibble
senior; Carol Myers, James soph-
omore; Bob Meikle, Gates sen~
ior; Charles Anderson, south
Younker sophomore; Elizabeth
Barnard, Loose hall junior; Wale
ly Stevens; Dibble junior; Doro-t
thy Jordan, Read senior; and
Sue Cary, Read junior.

So take a deep breath and
prepare yourselves gang, here
we go again!
