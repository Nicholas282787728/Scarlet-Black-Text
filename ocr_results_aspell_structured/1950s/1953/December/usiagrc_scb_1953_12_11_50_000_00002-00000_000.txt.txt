Next Question

The reason for the Cyclone’s predicament has narrow-
ed itself to this question, which those 789 students wllo
may now have to pay again for a yearbook already paid
for are quite interested in: Were Barry Lawrence an
Ed Ling told by Dean Brown
spring that money was not available for the yearbook?

If they were, would Ed and Barry have gone ahead
with their plans
from the sem fee?

Alld if Brown and Neveln knew last spring that the
money was unavailcble, why did Neveln this fall vote in
the Board of Publications to approve a Cyclone budget
which included an incomeitem of $2,060 from the sem fee?

The suggestions which Dean Fuller made in his letter
to the central committee regarding the semester fee are
good ones, but he is barking at the wrong tree The cen»
tral committee is not in any position to make the study
leading to a better defined allocation for the fee.

Although it is apparent that the administration would
like to have responsibility focused publicly

responsibility just ,doesn’t exist.

While theoretically the central committee makes the
original allocation and submits it for approval to the Stu-
dent Organizations committee and ultimately to the faculty,
in practice the central committee has been an approving
body to an allocation drawn by the Student Organizations
committee.

Either the Student Organizations committee has drasz

. tically amended the original central committee allocation,
as was. the case last year, or it has actually assumed the
responsibility for originating the distribution, as happened
this year, The customary role of the faculty has been that
of a rubber stamp. ,

But if this was the only reason Why the central com-

mittee lacked the power to effect changes in the sem fee‘

it would not be sufficient Another reason does exist.

According to my calculations
the cost of board at Gi-inncll
collcgc per student per day is
$2.00, assuming that the total
figure listed in the college eats
aloguc is correct.

I've long been convinced that
i could eat better and just as
cheaply offscampus, especially
since I seldom eat breakfast.
But the sports banquet the
other evening created a new
puzzle for me: “Why couldn’t
our food be half as good as that
at least oncc in a while?” The
Roqusfort cheese salad dressing,
for example, was unbelievably
good that night. but the same
kitchen that prepared that
dressing prepares the coagulat-
cd muck that is served up the
rest of the times You figure it
out.

Speaking of unit costs;
each time you cut a class it
costs you about $1.15, figured
on the basis of a cost of
$300.00 per semcster for ac-
tual tuition. Up a few cents ,
from last year.

that the buildings and grounds

repairs regardless of where the
fund is kept, that the inaccos,
bility of funds kept in college
departments is disadvantageous,
that the fund can be dealt with
adequately under c of HP sup-

funds are most easily accessible
and understood if kept by the
C of HP.

Another request by the
Controller, namely that the
money might be kept in a

the student auditor, met with
gencrnl approval by the coun-
oil.

The fund, which use of the

to be used primarily to pay off

With the exception of this year, 20% of the sem fee
is usually left in a reserve fund, and deposited in the treas»
urer’s office. This money, normally about $5,000, is used

.to bail out activities which have overspent their funds.

It is at this point that responsibility breaks down com—
pletely. Evidently ,no check is kept on organizations which
overspend. No one asks why they overspend. No one tells
them to stop spending. They may spend as much as they
wish, and apparently are not even limited by the amount
of money in the reserve. Whoever handles the account in
the treasurer‘s office just accepts the bills and pays them
from a general fund. ‘

No study of the sem fee‘s purpose and best practical
use; therefore,_can succeed unless it works closely with
the‘treasurer’s office, and unless it actually exercises the
power of allocation

" , The logical place for Dean Fuller’s suggestions to be
taken is the Student Organizations committee, not the
central committee.

Stick To Your Guns

The C of HP is wise to want to keep its own money.
If the treasurer’s office is able to lust easily declare that
it is the usual thing for the organizations and activities toI
overdraw the sem fee account by $5,000 every year, the-
men are justified in believing that they can handle their n t x
money themselves more easily and probably safer. Two alternatives in revamp“
