Stirring soup in the Quail kitchen, Gus Kalliass displays some
of the culinary virtuosity that has won for him the proud title

of “chef.”

You tloii’t sec much of Gus, unless you happenio work
in the Quad dining hall. You mav have caught a glimpse of

him as he llur

seen his eyes twinkle and his round lace beam as someone
reaches for it plate, snlffs appreciatively, and says “Mmm,

smel's good today."

if you could follow Gus back
into the kitchen, you would
discover what accounts for the
tantalizmg odors and the plain
good taste of the food he pre-
pares, For you would be watchr

40 years of experience as

break down the distinction be—

We believe that hall unity can
be better achieved through the

The new program will put
more responsibility on both
the upperclassmen and the
freshmen of the hall to work
together to achieve hail unity,

”There was no outside in-

said. "it was the decision of the

point by point. and in every
case except the issue of prep

there has been much liscussion
