Grinnell Ties, Loses Against Carls Ploneer Tennis Squad Beats

Bud Roegge, Griniiell first baseman, was picked off third base

The Grinnell baseball team was
defeated by Carleton 16~2 last
Saturday in the ﬁrst game of a
scheduled doubleheader, Tlle
second game was called at the
end of eight innings with the
score knotted, 10.10.

Ten Carleton hits combined
with 10 Grinnell errors ac—
counted for the lopsided score
in the ﬁrst contest. Grinnell
batters were limited to four
scattered hits by Carleton
hurler Pierce. Lee Moses went
all the way ior Grinneli and
allowed only two earned runs
The other 14 runs that crossed
the plate for the Corls were
the result of Grinnell mis-
cues.

Grinnell started off strong in
the second contest, with a SIX—
run tirst inning. However, Carlee
ton edged its way back into
the ball game and ﬁnally dead-
locked the score at ltl-ln in the
seventh inning. The scheduled
seven-inning arrair then went
into extra innings. Neither team
scored in the eighth, however,
and the game then had to be
called because of darkness.

Pioneer baseball coach J. A.
Pfifsch remarked that he was
disappointed at the team’s
showing against Carleton, es-
yecially in the opening game.
He added that Bill Blurray
and, Paul Kantzler were badly
missed, both offensively and
defensively Murray and
Kantzler were both sidelined
as a result of knee injuries

The Pioneer squad travels to
Monmouth today for a single
game and then to Knox tomore
row to face the Siwashers in a
doubleheader. Monmouth p05c
sesscs an excellent pitcher in

Dollinger, and also one of the
best defensive lnhelds in the
Midwest conference.

Thus for this season Knox
has a 1-5 record, its lone vio-
tory being over Cnel The Knox
team is strong oﬁensively, but
is rather weak defensively.
