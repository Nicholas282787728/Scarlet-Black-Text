Flyers' Problem: ‘How Do We Go to the Airport?’

By Jim Simmons

There is still one problem
which the active members of the
Grinnell College Flying Club
have not been able to sdlve.lt's
a long way out to the airport,
especially when you either have
to walk or hitchhike. As of now
no means of transportation has
presented itself. Considering the
problems which the members
have faced in the past, it does
not seem to difficult.

Last spring, several male stu-
dents became interested in the,
flying club. They intended to
chip in and somehow buy an
airplane. They consulted Samuel

 

N. Stevens, college president,
about the plan.

Stevens Interested

Mr. Stevens, a flying enthus-
iast himself who owns and ﬂys
his own airplane, was interested
in the idea and suggested that
the students share this idea with
the rest of the college. Why not
organize a flying club in the
school he idea seemed to have
possih es and was agreed up-
on. They didn’t remotely suspect
the multitude of problems which
lay before them.

The first thing to be done was
to buy, borrow, or steal an air-
plane. The students dug deep in—
to their pockets, counted their
coins and decided that they were
a little short of moneyi

 

They drew up a constitu—

tion and had it tentatively
approved, subject to minor
changes, and began selling
memberships to the club.
With this money and air
other sum which was hor—
rowed, they had enough to
purchase their airplane.
Pres. Stevens allowed
to use his airplane in

Problems Arise

This time proved to be short
and problems descended upon
them. Where were they going
to' find a licensed instructor to
serve as director; how much in-
surance would be needed for
adequate coverage; what rates to

them charge for flying, and where to

search for a plane priced to fit of these problems.

their pocketbooks. They found
the plane they wanted and pure
chased it from Glen Neider-
hauser, an airport operator in
Marshalltown. The big problem
seemed to have been conquered,
It looked as if maybe there
would be smooth sailing for a
while.

After many extra—curricu—
lar hoiirs and falling grades,
these problems melted away
and the plan became a real—
ity. Now the club has paid
off its debts and has a lit-
tle siini set back for a rainy
day.

One member of the group has

'alIeady received his private pi-
lot’s license and five others have
soloed. Joe Piper, Union sopho-
more and vice president of the
club, was the first to receive
his license through the club, and
the fdllowing men have Soloed:
Gene Brinton, town sophomore;
Bill Keister, Smith sophomore;
Bob Smaiiey, Dibble annex
sophomore; Bernard Zavatsky,

Only Two in Iowa
