Act One; Scene One

The first of a series of articles on the general value
of absence rules appears in this issue, Specifically reporting
the use of unlimited cutting privileges, and grade averages,
of students who were on the Dean’s list last semester.

This article will be followed by similar statistical

studies of grade averages, use of cuts, and extent of excused
absences by all students last semester, and reports of other
schools’ policies on class absences. The purpose of the
series is to determine the value of the present Grinnell cut
rll e.
, Frankly, as we begin the study of the cut rule, we
are skeptical of the Grinnell policy; but because we have
only the first article on which to base our opinion, we will
Wait until the series is finished to present our conclusions
and recommendations, commenting during the series only
when necessary for a better understanding.

At the start we want to call attention to the series,
not only the attention of the Personnel Board, which de-
termines Grinnell’s rule, but also the attention of the facul-
ty and student body, so that their opinion may be well-
founded and inﬂuential

That in again, out again, back again television set is
apparently more trouble than it is worth. At least it would
seem so.

It was recovered from the third ﬂoor of Blair hall one
month ago this week, was taken to the police station for
safekeeping, and hasn’t found its way back to' the campus
yet.

There has been-some trouble, of course The social
committee says it is presently being repaired. But it is
more than likely that a major factor in the set’s continued
residence off campus is that no one seems to know what
to do with it when it gets back.

" Letters To The Editor

To the editor:

There comes a-time when _a
person's righteous indignation is
aroused to the extent that he
can no longer remain silent. l
have reached that point.

Recently; various members’of
the student body, including
ireshmon, received the iollowing
notice; “The Scholarship come
mittee has asked me to remind
you that you are not meetlng
the requirement oi as requircd
for your Younker Honor Scho-
larship. If you are to be con-
Sidered for this grant for the
next academic year, you must
have the 3.3 average required.”
The little “note: was signed by
Dean Henry Al. Brown, chain
man oi the Scholarship commit-
tee.

What galls me is that this
notice was sent to ircshmcn. A
new student at college has a
certain amount of adjusting to
do. Usually this period oi re-
adjustment comcs during the
first semester oi the freshman
year, During this time, the stu-
dent is required to take certain
courses which require a great
deal oi proiiciency. One such
course is Basic Communications.
The average student that takes
this course has had no speech
experience. Certain professors
in this department have such

changing oi the grading system.
Dean Fuller assured me that the
committee wasn’t trying to take
away scholarships and that ii
would make every considera-
tion possible, it seems that this
committee has made a hasty
“about isco" in its policy.

A good example oi an in~‘

consistency in this system is in
thc scicncc department. in some
classes, the student is graded
numerically and the numbers
are equated to a letter grade.
A student wlth a 90 average is
given a is. Under the old grad-
mg system, the student would
be two points highcr than the
necessary as Under thc new
system, the student is .3 points
below the necessary average.‘
Is the committee taking this incl
to Consideration? Obviously notll

l don't know what the pur-I
pose oi the littlc “greeting”
was, but i do know that it has
created an adverse effect. Like
any “club" method, it has failed
to stimulate a desire for better
grades, Instead, it has created a
ieeling 0t iutility among many
of the students.

in conclusion, i would likc'
to say that l condemn this di
play or power by Certain mem-
bers of the administration. This
is an area Where the phrase
”extenuating circum s ta n co s "
could be used wlth ample lusti-
iication and decency.

MOURNERS

by Ed Lning

I have a theory. I’m in favor
oi unsportsmanllke conduct by
spectators at athletic Contests.
I favor all sorts of yelling and
booing and stamping and carry
ings~on. Here’s why.

l

Once there was a tribe oi
Indians. They all lived
tightly organized little commun.
ity of pueblos or some such
a p at t ment-houserlike arrange~
mcnt. Social interaction was
complex and everyone was al-
ways running into everyone
else.

In the course of their lives
the demands of the system gen-
erated a good deal of friction
and tensions and sharpening oi
tomahawks. But this was al-
right because this tribe of reds
men was very warlike, and all
the tensions that occurred were
vented in terrible whoop-and-
holler Wars.

Everyone would scream and
yell and triple the tensions and
have a heckuva good time and
then go home all tuckered out
and ready to cooperate and be
pcocciul.

They had to vent all those
aggressions. i doubt ii they
much cared who won the battle
but they felt better scalping
a stranger instead of the squaw
back home. The modern world
(including Grinnell) has 1000
more irustrsticmbuilders. Some-
times it takes a Student Council
convention or a ball game to
channel student frustration in.
to a drain pipe.

The trouble is that who wins
the war may make on important
difference sometimes. And some
people still believe who is
elected Student Council prexy
makes a difference.

#:n

I have another theory. All
applicants who try out or run
ior positions of trust and re-]
sponsihility in various organiza~‘
trons ought to declare that they
believe that they can do the
job better than anyone else.

li they can’t sincerely admitl
this, then they have a low re-
gard ior the organization in-
volved. If they are to be re-
sponsible in large part for the
success oi the group and yet
believe that somebody else can
do a better job, then they care
more for theirpcrsonal glory
and egos than they do ior thel
success oi the group.

If there seem to be ally “jag"
candidates for Student Council
prexy I suggest that the voters
consider this theory. Some peo-
ple still believe that who the
S. C. pres. is makes a difference.
