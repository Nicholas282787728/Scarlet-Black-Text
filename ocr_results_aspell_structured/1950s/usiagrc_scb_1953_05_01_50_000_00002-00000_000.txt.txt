The administration seems to have hit a snag in its plans
for Commencement this year. The housing plans for the
quad are moving along quite Well, but the arrangements on
north campus are in a muddle.

Several ideas are batted around. Moving all senior men to
one hilll, moving them all to one floor in their own hall, and
letting them stay in their own rooms over the week end, all,
are being considered.

If our friends in the administration building Will heed our
suggestion We think that they Should be allowed to stay
Where they are. After attending school for four years, sen-
iors should be permitted to spend the last hectic days at
Grinnell without moving all their belongings to spend four
or five days in another room.

The alums, parents, students and friends were all housed
last year. And the seniors didn’t have to move. Why take
away this last privilege?

Tomorrow Grinnell College will be holding its eighth an-
nual Writers’ Conference. Last year, we are Sorry to say,
the meetings were poorly attended by Grinnell students.
When Grinnell succeeds in bringing men of national repute]
to the campus for such a meeting, it is disappointing to
both the guest speakers and the prize-winning writers to
find such an apparent lack of interest in the student body.

We think the Writers’ Conference is as much an all—school
event as a basketball game, and certainly as profitable If
attendance continues to be poor, the conference may be dis-
continued. This year we hope students will show that they
know a good thing when they have it.

Players in ‘Pursuil of Happineis' :
Entertain Grinnelljheairewﬁoers

by Suzi MncCluskey

The Grinnell Players produc-
tion of Lawrence Langner and
Armina Marshall Langner's "Pure
suit of Happiness” delighted a
small but appreciative audience
of ‘Grinnell theatrEVgoers last
Wednesday night in AR‘H audi-
'torium.

The script, though somewhat
patriotic and flagewaving
spots, was given a sparkling,
rollicking, yet tritle unpolished
performance by the Players,

‘It showed several deft touches
in the direction which was
capably handled by rtoger
Pen-y, Nancy Nattemer, and
Tom Read. The most obvious
criticism of the directing. a
criticism which is only Worth
noting, was the staging of the
crowd scenes on a small stage.

It Special honors are to go to
individual actors and actresses,
this writer would most enthusi-
astically endorse Jo Anne Tam’s
more than coquettish Meg, Jim
Leavenworth’s gallant, yet stricte
ly military, Colonel Sherwood,
Jerry Tomlinson's busybody,
Hellfire and Damnation Raver»
end Banks, and Jack Reddan’s
Sly and humorous Aaron Kirke
land. Each of these players gave
their portrayal what, in theatre
terms, is called “a comic touch."

ot the other Players in the
cast, one would say they carried
their roles well and in most
spots their characterizations add-
ed immeasurably to the show.
Doug Bannister was seliecon-
scious but showed promise. Mar-
ilyn Mabbot might have been
more commanding as Comfort
Kirkland. prudence, asplayed

in,

by Tobianne southern, was sweet'
but at times modern and over-
aggressive. Hull Pcthoven was a
"bumpkiny" country bumpkin,
which is to his credit. And. Ed
Lil-lg gave a convincing perform-
ance as Mose.

The technical work done on
this production'should also be
given special recogn' ion, Janis
Marvin and Virgi ia Home
Who, under the supervision of
Kent Andrews, handled cos-
umes and setting respectively,
arm with be proud and satis-
l lied ’with a job well dimer

The greatest cr sm to be
made of the show as a whole is
that the pace was sporadic
rather than consistent and fast
moving which is the pace ex»
pccted of comedy. This was parts
inlly due to the actors’ inability
to “ride the laughs and 3p
plause" of their actively respon-
sive audience and to their lack
of‘ theatrical timing.

All told, the Grinnell Players
definitely “had something Hot”
waiting for their audience ‘and
should be commended for their
production.

Whenever the weather gets
like this i think of the time
my sister took me to the Chis
czrgo World's Fair, a Century of
Frogress. It rained.

They had all kinds or foreign
exhibits like Little Egypt, Little
Italy, and The Sidewalks of
Paris, in which ladies did dances
although it was very hot and
sticky. l was only five then and
hadn‘t cultivated much of an
interest in dancing, though I

by Bruce Cole

,remember feeling sorry tor those

nice ladies because it was too
hot to do all that wiggling,
even with all their clothes oit,

My sister must have felt Sor—

.ry for the nice ladies too be-

cause we didn’t stay at any of
those foreign places very long.
Instead We Went to the Fire-
stone tire building and watched
them make tires. It smelled like
they were burning tires; i knew

that smell very well because‘

my hobby was throwing tires
into incinerators which is easier
than making stink bombs At
the Firestone place they made
little tires with ash tr‘nys in the
middle and gave them away
while they were still hot. Mine
nearly burned my hands
which is why I've never cared
much for Firestone products. i
guess. That wise guy probably
thought I’d forget about his little
trick by the time I got around
to buying any tires.

My sister was always making
me do things she knew I was
atrnid of. They hzd a big tower
at the fair; it was all white and

looked like a lighthouse. You
had to walk up a spiral stair-
case clear to the top. When you

,got up there you Sat down in

front of a little black hole just
big enough to rit into and some
guy kicked you in the rest of
the way and the next thing you
knew you were sliding down
a dark shute like a sack of
laundry. Whon I came out I
landed on a prickly welcome
mat and i was really scared.
Mv sistcr thought it best for me
to conquer this fear so she
made me do it over again, three
times. Finally i cried and vom-
ited on her shoes and she stop-
ped teasing me,

I got even better revenge over
on the Midway where all the
roller-coasters and rides were.
i didn’t like rollerecoasters any
better than I liked the laundry
shute. The only trouble was that
my stomach was empty and i
couldn’t express myseli. l was
sort or skinny then so when she
tried to get me to go on the
highest ride they had-l let her
buy me a ticket and push me
through the turnstile. Then when
it was our turn to get in the
car 1 turned around and tried
to squeeze back through the
turnstile.

Well, I only made it halfway.
The knob on the turnstilc stuck
in the hollow of my chest and
,1 couldn’t move either way. I
[wanted to cry but i had all i
[could do to breathe and curse
my sister a little. Everybody
[tried to get me out and they
:kept telling me to relax and
iexhale and a bunch of stuff
|that I didn't pay any attention
to. Finally the fire department
took the whole turnstile apart
and i got out. As soon as i
could cry I did and they bought
me some ice cream and every-
thing else 1 wanted, just like
‘after rd had my tonsils out.

 

No one paid any attention to
lmy sister; 1 even got my picture
in the paper. , ,
