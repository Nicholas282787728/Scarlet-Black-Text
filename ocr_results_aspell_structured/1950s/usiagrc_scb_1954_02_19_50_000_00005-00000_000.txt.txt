Hoopsters Tackle Knox there; .
Host laurilzen and (20. Tuesday .

The Grinnell Pioneers will be gunning for their second
and third wins in a row this weekend when they tackle
lowly Knox at Galesburg, 111., tomorrow night, and then
entertain Angustana here next Tuesday.

Tomorrow’s clash with the

Siwashers probably will be much
closer than the records of the
two teams might indicate. Knox,
which is dwelling in the Mid-
west conference cellar, has only
won one conference game while
dropping nine. However, the
Galesburgers are, like almost
all Midwest
rough to beat on their home
court,

Kmx’s offense is headed by
fol-ward Karl Hurdle and
guard Dick Culbertson who
are averaging 15 to 13 points
per game respectively.
