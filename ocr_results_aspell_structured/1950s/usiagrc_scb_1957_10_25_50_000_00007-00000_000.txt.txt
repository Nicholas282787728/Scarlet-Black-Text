Time Magazine's Cover S+ory From Composer's House On “Italy Hill" Welch Vivl'Fies
Sees Murrow's 'Magic Gif’rs' Comes Tailor-Made Music Al Grinnell

By Stair iteportcrs

“Among the trite and untrue that shed at hoiiky-tonk
glare from the nation’s TV sets conic moments that pierce
reality and live up to television’s magic gift for thrusting

millions of spectators at mice

into the lap of history in the

making. As television moved this week into its second (lees
ade, chances were that some of the best of suclr moments in

the new season would come irom
a dark, high-domed man with a
hang-dag look, an apocalyptic
voice and a cachct as plain as
his inevitable cigarette. His

name: Edward R, (for Roscoe)
Murrow.

‘Immatui‘c Mnturity'

"Many have come and many
have iallen in TVs growth to
immaturc maturity, but CBS’s
Ed Murrow, 49, marches on as
TV's top journalist." Appearing
in the Sept. 30 edition of Time
magazine, the preceding quotaa
tion keynotes a sncpage study
of Murrow and at his contrlhuA
tions to the television industry.

Murrow’s programs, “See
it Now” and “Person to Per-
son," command an audience of
millansr Singled out as the re
cipicnt oi honors and awards
more ottcn than any other TV
personality. he is idolized, im—
itated and respected by the
entire industry, as well as by
viewers and newsmakcrs.

Why this amazing popularity?
Time attempts to supply an an—
swer. Although it recognizes
that many- broadcasters surpass
Muirow in such spccitic skills
.as writing, ad-hbbing, analysis,
gencral inioimalion and news
gathering, the magazine explains
his power on the strength of two
attributes

Sense 01' Obligation

The expertness of his delivery,
accented by the subtle drama
or his pauses, lends to his ncwsA
casting an aura or personal con-
cern and meaning that is round
nowhere else. Time attributes
.lo Murrow a strong sense or so-
cial obligation, stating
iecls dtltv bound to kccp the
people informed and that the
conviction and Sln'ci‘ity he feels
toward his work is' contagious,
giving each listener an indivi
dual intcrcst in otherwise dlSr
tant and abstract items of ncws.

This individual quality of
Murrow’s work, Tirnc says,

is enhanced by his dexterity

in reporting atmosphere
through the audio-visual devi-
ces. He “covers" his stories
from top to bottom, delving
into each and cvcry phase.

Commuting across oceans and
continents to keep his journa-
listic commitments, Murrow
comes home armed with the

“feel” or the actual happen-
ings. It is this "feel” that he
communicates to his audience

in the most realistic reporting

tcclinionc yet to be used in
documentary iilms.

Journalist, analyst, correspon-
dent and director. confidant of
Presidents and Prime Ministers,
Murrow is an ideal i‘cpresentac
tivc of America‘s youngest and
most ianreachlng medium.

Phillips

By Ned Donahoe
Speech

I recall the 'first time I
met Blll ill Phillips, head of
the division of theory and
composition, school of music,
University of Illinois, He and
his wife were sitting huddled
under a blanket, sharing a can
of beer and worrving about the
premier pertormance of his ’cel-
lo sonata. Since 1 was worrying
about some production or other.
I got 2| blanket and joined them.

Later that evening we found
that we had stopped worrying
and decidcd to do a production
at Sartrc's “The Flies,” with Bur-
lill writing the music Grinncll
audiences heard this score last
spring during our own prodnci
tion of the play.

Phillips has written a num-
licr ot diverse pieces 01' music,
sonic ct which have been re-
L'ui'tled by noted orchestras
and artists ile has also expel”
imentcd in opera. One. called
“Don’t We All" has been pcn
tornicd by colleges and univer—
sities in all iarts oi the coun-

ti Some people hold that it’s
ditticnlt to sing.

How docs hc compose? What
does he look like in [rent of a
blank piano? I dOn't know.
We’re visitcd the Phillips many
times on their-farm on italy
llill in New York‘s Finger Lakc
region 1 know he does most of
his work there in an old {arid
house which he and Alberta rc—
claiincd from decay some years
ago while he was teaching at
Eastman in Rochester i say he
is reputed to work there, but
I’ve never seen im throw even
a slightly suspi ous glance at
the piano.

Mostly he seems to rcad, or
drive to a place called The Blue
Eagle for supplies, or sits up
late and laughs, or gets up at
midmorning to cat the black
bass we catch in his pond behind
the brtar patch.

Critics have said his work
has a marked rhvthmic and
percussive style. How can we
explain this? Not because he
was raised in Denver, 1 sup—
pose. I do know that he and
Alberta were married at an
carly age and borrowed a
friend’s caliin in the mountains
tor the honeymoon—and pro-
ccedcd to burn it down the
iirst night. But perhaps this,
too, has little to do with the
nervous intensity of his pre-
sent stylc,

The score for "Dr. Faustus"
was written at italy Hill last
summer. We spent a preliminary
week sh o u tin g Marlowe's
"mighty lilies" at each other
while the kids shot off beebec
guns or rattled pans no and Ela
bcrt Smith exchanged scvcral
letters about the sizc oi the or-
gan in Herrick chapel, and Bur»
rill made some hurried trips to
Rochester to (TV out ideas on a
similar instrument there. We
may say, then. that thc Faustus
music is tailormade for Gllh‘
ncll.
