Cagers Open Year
Against Augustana
Tuesday in Darby

The Pioneer basketball
squad will open its 1958-59
season here Tuesday evening
against Augllstana college of
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
Game time is 7:30.

Augustana finished last season
with an overall record of eight

wins and l2 losses. They come
piled a record of six wins and
six losses in the North Central
conference, which was good
enough for a third place finish.

This season Augustana’s
hopes will ride largely in the
hands of sophomores. There
are nine sophomores on the 13-
man squad, 0f the three re-
turning Augustana lettcrmen,
two, guard Bob Amundson and
forward Bub Peterson, are
scheduled. to start against
Grinnell. The remaining three
starters will be sophomores,

led by 6‘s" center Andy
Schwartz.
The Grinnell starting lineup

is not yet lully determined, ac<
cording to John A. Pfitsch, head
basketball coach. He commented
that Bill Mcclintock is certain
to start at the center position
and that coecaptains John Cope»
land and Paul Kantzler “prob—
ably" will start at the guards.
However, he added that it was
a tossup at the forward posi-
tions belween Jim Simmons and
Lee Moses at one slot and among
Denny Collis, Dave DeLong,
Norm Sonju and Jim Lowry at
the other. “We will probably
have quite a few changes in per—
sonnel as the season precedes."

Piitsch commented that he
was not particularly pleased
with the showing of his cagers
in practice sessions so tar. He
added that although his men
have progressed as much as
could be expected in the lim—
ited time available, they are
behind somc of his other
teams in previous years “Our
shooting will have to improve
a great deal if we are to make
a good showing against Aug-
ustana." He also remarked
that thc Pioneers will have to
improvc their speed.

The Pioneers have met Aug-
uslana in basketball only once
in recent years. That one meet.
ing was during the 195152 sea-
son when Grinnell dropped a
55.53 decision to the South Da<
kota team.

Whitney Announces
That Military Ball
May Be Presented

“If the students really want
a military ball, one will be put
on." stated Cadet Commander

~Eli Whitney concerning a vote

taken by the Student Council
not to appropriate moncy for
thc ball.

Whitney listed several rea-
sons against having the ball
this year. The corps is small
and a dance takes. according
to Whitney, ”a lot or work."
it is also his opinion that stu-
dents “just take it as another
tormalu and don’t get the
proper "spirit” ot the ball,
which is to promote good ree
lations between the college
and the corps. Whitney sug-
gestcd as a substitute a din.
ner dance ior thc cadets and
their dates “as they do at
some other colleges."
However, Whitney felt that

the corps “owes a military ball
to thc students” and that it
would “hurt the corps tre—
mendously“ it one were not put
on.

A dance will still be put on,
hc stated, but it will be less
elaborate, decorations will be
cut down and there will be a
less expensive band. “We are
still looking for funds and are
hoping that we will not have
to sell sandwiches again this
year, as it takes much time
and work," he concluded.
