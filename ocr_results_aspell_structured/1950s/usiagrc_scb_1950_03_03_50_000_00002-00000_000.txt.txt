It is witll the greatest reluctance tllat we are forced to
announce the withdrawal of our own S & B candidate, John
Spellmen, from the Student Council presidency race. Unr
fortunately the open-faced, likeable, four foot-seven inch
Junior was, like two other hopefuls, disqualified on the
grounds that he had not passed the required number of
qualifying examinations. Where our boy fell downior per—

Questions and Questions

We have some questions to ask.

We could work up a fast intro, a few bars in 4'4 time
or a couple of stanzas of Chaucer-ion heptastitch to set the
stage, but the questions are the thing and we believe that
the reasons behind the asking are obvious and in good order.

Why is it that in one of the polls conducted by our
staff twenty percent of those polled in a given hall said
that they would not vote for any of the candidates? 1

Why it is that not a single woman on the campus subr
mittefl a petition of candidacy for Student Council presi-
dent‘.7

Why is it that out of a large junior class only five menr
submitted petitions (two of the five have since been dis-
qualified) 7

We want to know.

Carleton to Crinnell . . . .

Mr. John Pfitsch
Basketball Coach
Grinnell College
Grinnell, Iowa.
Dear Mr. Pfitsch:

I have never been appointed to send a message of sym-
pathy to coaches whose terms lose to Carletoniin fact I
have never done this beforeibut ill View of the wild nature
of last night’s game, I thought I would send you these brief
comments.

The Carleton student body was quite impressed by the
excellent sportsmanship shown by both you and the Grin-
nell players. I happen to be a student here myself, and in
the inevitable discussions of the game that were carried
on after the game was over the point was brought out r
peatedly that the entire Grinnell representation acted very.
well in View of all the circumstances surrounding the game.
The attitude of your team was the exception rather than
the rule with teams that have played here this year.

I don‘t know if I‘m getting my point across, but in last
night’s game the Grinnell basketball team won a lot of ad—
miration from the Carleton students. Many of us who saw
the Pioneers defeat the Carls twice last year and once this
year felt that Carlton rose to its best game in four years
to upset one of the better small college teams in this area.
We sincerely believe that playing the style of ball we did
last night, Carleton would have lost only one or two games

, this season.
Best of luck on the remainder of your schedule and
in the NAIB.
Sincerely yours,
JACK GOODWIN
