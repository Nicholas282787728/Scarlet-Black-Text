Exhibit Shows

"Kinetic" Art

An exhibition of 14
“kinetic” paintings by Rich-
tlril Bowman will be hung in
Main hall for the next three
weeks, starting Tuesday and
remaining through March 1.

Through his paintings. which
are circulated by the Western
Association of Art Museum Dls
rectors, Bowman attempts to
depict what he says is the “note-
worthy characteristic" oi the
20th centul‘y——"rapid change."
"All one has to do." he says, “is
to organize these aspects and
translate them into the‘painter’s
language."

Bowman’s work since 1943 has
,iallen into iour major group»
ings: ”Rock and Sun," “Kineto
graph“ and “Micromacrocosmos,”
on dealing with such modern
.concepts as atomics and cosmic
rays; and a series on related
ideas, such as “nature iorms
bursting into lite" and “com~
posite, moving aspects or normal
visual reality."
