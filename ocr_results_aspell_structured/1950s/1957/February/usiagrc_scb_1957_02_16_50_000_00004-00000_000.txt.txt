Travers Outlines SC' 5 Duties;
Reviews Year's Achievements

By Art Travers

pealed in the new spapel However, I believe that the actions
and functions of the Student Council ale impoltant enough

to be 1.epeated

The council’s actions and duties could be roughly divided
into three areas. First, those functions which are tlle duties

of every StudentnCouncil; sec-
ond, those functions and actions
which the council has Worked
on this year; and third, those
actions which are currently be»
ing taken.

Council Duties

In the first category, the Coun-
cil each year performs the fol-
lowing duties:

1 Supervises Class elections.
2. Chooses the Student Audie
tor from applications.

3. Chooses the social co-or-
dinator, Gadabouis chairman,
Off-Campus chairman, Inform-
al chairman and Union chair-
man. These selections are
made from applications after
personal Interviews \vith,the
candidates.

4. Chooses the Central Clean-
ing agency managers for north
and south campus.

5. Apportions the semester
fee. (You are charged$15.00 each
semester as a social fee. Of that
fee, $5.00 goes to the Student
Council.) with this money,
KGRW, the 58:13, the student
auditor, the work on Lake Acre.
etc. are financed. We also made
it possible for Richard Maltby,
Duke Ellington,.Louis Armstrong
to appear at Grinnell. and are
currently helping “Guys and
Dolls." .

6. Appoints Student Council
,representatives to faculty com-
‘mittees. Those committees are
social calendar, Student or-
ganizations, Public Events,
Homecoming and Commence-
ment, and Publications.

7. Appoints the officers of the
Pep club

a. Appoints Fetzer Sing chair-
men.

9. Plans Spring Day and Vic.
torv Day.

These nine functions are im-
portant ones. It is true that they
don't get much play in the coun-
cil reports and the newspaper,
but this is because these func-
tions ale taken for granted, not
because they are unimportant.
The efficient accomplishment of
old functions is as important as
the achieving of new ones.

Functions Assumed

Secondly, there is the area of
the functions that the council
has assumed this year. These

1 feel that these are positive
accomplishments that the coun-

Present Projects

Right now the council is

2. Student Union

1 don’t helieve that these im-
portant areas can be finished be-
fore the new president takes
over and I would hope that he
or she would continue to work
on them As far as I am con-
cerned the liaison question still
needs discussion

if you as a student feel that
the council should have done

more, I am,snl-ry that I did
not accomplish more. I say I
am sorry because any failures
of the council this year have
been my fault and not the
council’s.

I feel, however, that this has
been a successful year. I wish
to thank the members of the
Student Council who worked
hard to make this possible. I
wish to thallk,the administration
and faculty for their willingness
to help the council, Especially I
Want to thank those students,
who although not on the coun-
cil, came to meetings, or work
ed on council committees. or
who took an active interest in
student government. It is you
who make student government
worthwhile.

A unified C of HP. and
League Board, abolishment of
Student Council, legalized
drinking in the halls for stu—
dents who are twenty one, and
the sale of fake identification
for $10 per semester are the
principal planks in the plat-
form of Bill Goggln.

Bill Bell also feels the heel
for action on this issue. Hit plat-
form advocates "3.2 at 18.”

John E. Hering's platform i
based on “the very explicit phil-
osophical doctrine that the Stu-
dent Council, popularly known
as the ‘coke- machine council'. is
NON- EXISTENT. "

"A stronger spirit of apathy
among students, faculty and
administration“ is the policy
suggested by John Condon in
his platform.

Bill McCormac declared, “M
platform is for the abolition o
Student Council and for th
rights of all my fellow Alaskans.
‘Long live Big Erother'!“

One other Langan candicte

cratic society", states Hewitt.

John Hokenstad, Gates did not
submit their platforms.
