I had not been on campus
more tlltlli 10 minutes last
Sunday before I heard that
our football team will be
“the best seen around here

such insight have themselves
been here only two or threc
years, but pr season predictions

and evidently a regularity at
Grinnell

A moderate amount ot optic
mism is certainly acceptable,
and even necessary whore school
spirit is to be high. However,
an excess at flattering prc
trons by players. coaches. and,
worst 0 all. the various "sport
analysts“ on campus before the
scason gets under way is not
only unpleasant, but otten
harmful.

if a squad is praised out of
proportion to its ability, its
supporting body is likely to
be So disillusioned in the fame
of defeat that all interest and
backing will be lost. Such was
the case last fall, and it could
easily happen again,

There is something sound in
a philosophy which says that
if a student body is led to be-
lieve that its team has merely
developed satisfactorily, and is
therefore unlikely to per-
form miracles, it (the student
body) will tend to cultivate a
loyalty and spirit that will sus—
tain itself in defeat. and rise to
. mmes in victory. This is the
kind of spirit needed at Grim

our lo. rig teams at a time when
our support is most vital. A
