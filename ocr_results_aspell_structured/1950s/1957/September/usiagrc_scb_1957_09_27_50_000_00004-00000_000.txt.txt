sues four-iifths or more think
alike, Their major objective
is material gratiﬁcation, and
few show any interest in re-
form or. change, or civic and
political responsibility. Most-
nre interested in religion, but
as an individual matter re-
lated to one's peace of mind,
and without social or humanie
tarian implications, Bowen
said,

The studies show that college
students are more tolerant, less
dogmatic and less prejudiced
than other young people with
regard to race, nationality, re—
~ligion, ideas, and also in per-
sonal standards of conduct
when confronted with a conflict
of values.»they consider self.
interest first, then social acceptr
ance, then friendship, and
finally moral principles.

A Few axe Idealistil:

“One finding of these studies
is especially significant for us
at Grinnell,” Dr. Bowen ob—
served, “Despite the general
complacency, a few colleges are
able to produce a distinctive
way of life which sharpens
ethical sensitivity and hightens
idealism.

Grinnell was not included in
the Studies, but I know that
the atmosphere of Gﬁnnell
has been traditionally idealis»
tic. The great professors and
administrators of the past —
the ones Who have left the
deepest imprint on this col-
lege—have consistently excl-L
ed a strong inﬂuence toward
idealism.”

Bowen illusutrated the Era

with a quote from former pro.
fessor of philosophy John D.

Fine Arts building, and for
new dormitories to be available
in several years. “I feel reason-
ably confident that we shall be
able to raise enough money

But i am not certain. It’ will
take a lot of hard work and
some luck,” he said.

“Guard Against Conformity"

ln commenting upon the re-
lationship of the studies he cited
to Grinneil, Bowen said, ”I
doubt that the values of Ameri-
can students generally are
shared by Grinnellians. Yet, liv-
ing as we do in a society char—
acterized by complacent selfe
interest,-and motivated by the
creed of comfort, we must guard

against unwitting conformity
and resolve that Grinneil shall
continue to be a center from
which idealism radiates.

“The Grinnell ideal is that
every student who leaves here
will dedicate his his to the ser-
vice of his fellow men what-
ever may be his vacation or his
stationl in life. He will use his
talents, his knowledge, his lea-
dership, and his inflhence to
make’ this a better world. He
will not be a mere adjuster to
the world as it is, but an active
force working for the good, of
his fellow man. Grinnell exists
