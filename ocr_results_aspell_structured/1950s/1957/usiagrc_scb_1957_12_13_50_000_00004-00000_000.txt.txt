Should we have a grading system? fourth hour pro-
jects? mi -semester exams? grouping of departments by
divisions? Ailevel courses? tlle present scope of subject
matter? The curriculum is basic in student interest, and
yet it seems to be taboo as far as constructive considera»
tion goes. \\'ell-tllought-out recommendations from the stu—
dents would undoubtedly be welcomed and incorporated in
part by the faculty and administration. We have a voicci
_wliy not use it?

Grinnell students are interested ill many aspects of
campus life — whether women should have integrated halls,
how prospective students are being treated, to what activ-
ities student money should be allotted, etc etc. If we
can judge by other colleges in Iowa and ’Nebldblia, this ill-
terest is more worthwhile and carries more weight here
than than on most campuses.

However, most of our interests are on a superficial,
”extracurricular" level: We are here to learn, to gripe,
and to be recognized on minor points. When our apathy
snaps momentarily, we feel faint tugs at the hearts gs
for “old Gl‘innell,” But do we have any real responsibility
to the college Well, after all, “e are paying customers,
aren’t we?

As to admissions policy: By what standards should
students be considered for Grinnell college? What propor-
tioll of emphasis should be placed on intellectual ability,
extracurricular record, geographical distribution, etc. ‘2 Evi-
dently the administration is‘interested in opinions on such
topics, since it sent questionnaires to the Advisory Council,
Certainly the student view on such problems would be of

interest at least, and probably it would figure to some ex-
tent in policy formation.

Certainly it is easier to remain on our present “extra-
curricular" level of interest in prepping, Lake Acre, victory
day, and the like, But Grinnell students have a voice It
could be used to participate in the basic levels of college
functioning —,sucli as curriculum and admissions policy—
in addition to its present necessary splierei We need a spark
toward this new level from student government, and a
mature realization that at the basic level we are a \rel—
come, but completely advisory, factor.

By Gene Thompson

Americans are oncc again
about to celebraic. Christmas in
their own way. in’uddiiion to
the purely American holidays
like Thanksgiving, independ
ence Day, Memorial Day, and
Natlonal Women’s Clubs Day,
we seem to have «so no.
invenlcd a “m
tional Xmas.‘

None of us
hccds to be i _
minded that thc
American Xmas
is composed or
equal parts of

”religi o n,"
“Xmas chccr,"
and bigrbusi-

ness, and we are also perfect-
ly aware that the greatest at
these is big business. It seems
as it Scrooge had the right
idea after all, and that his
“Humbug!" could nowhere bc
so fittingly applied than in the
streets of any American city or
town during the “Xmas" season,

A merry Christmas to those
who have rcacced against ihc
charge-account and Iay~awny
Xmas, and may their tribe in-
crease. To those who have
succumbed (or will succumb)
co the Madison Avenue line
(“give a strand-so electric ra-
zor in EVERYONE on your
shopping list"), I can only
wish Scrooge’s epithet on
them _. they are mechanical,
hard-hearted creatures. May
the red ink on their budgets
haunt them on the night he»
tore their “Xmas," and may
ihey be boiled in their own
pudding and buried with a

’ Yule Log

Cont. from p. 1
changed very little.

The origin as taken from a
letter to an alum, Mary Stim-
son Gates, ’l8, is as follows:
“The 1915 YWCA president
wanted a special Christmas 31
meeting. Perhaps i had been
reading something for English
about the old Yule log ceremon-
ies; perhaps I had the sugges<
tion from someone on‘the social
committeeil do not rcmcmbcr.
Wc heldour first Christmas din-
ner in the dining room, with
candles to light the tables,
home made candy, and turkey.

“Then we gathered, son strong,
in the drawing room. President
Main (probably the most hand-
some college president this
U.S.A. had ever seen, six»foot»
four and built ior it) lit the
first Yul‘e log, with remarks
about the wonder and beauty of
the Christmas season and the
hope that we would carry it
with us wherever we \vcnti
country communities or large
cities. We sang two or three
carols by‘ fireligllt. That was all
daboui a half-hour. Dean Gates
carefully quenched the log and
later had a metal box made in
which to keep it for the follow-
ing year.”

in the Yule log 1 box. The
metal box in which Dean Gates
placed the first log’s embers, now
rests inside a now box dedi-
catcd in 1951 which is kept by
lhc dean oi women. On the lid
oi the box are inscribed the
names of all of the YWCA and
League Board presidents.

The ccremony today consists
of placing a wreath on top of
the log that has been preserved
in the [ire-box Both will be set
ailrc from last year’s Yule log
remains. The preserved log sym-
bolizes the tradition or a con-
tinuing spirit oi fellowship,
while ihc wreath symbolizes
iricndship and the Christmas
spirit.

After the lighting oi the
fire, there is traditionally the
explanation or the meaning or
the log, n Christmas story,
read by the dean or women; a
musical selection by a soloist;
u Speaker: a prayer, and the
singing or “Silent Night-aim
first verse sung by the Wo-
men’s Glee Club, the second
by everyone.

Tradilion has it that women
dross entirely in white, and
that ii is a Yule Log supper
rather than a dinner as is the
man's Boar’s Head.

in a quote that doubliessiy
st'll applies, an old-Quadrangle
record book says of the first
Yule log ceremony, “the whole
hour was resuul. and inspiring.
and iull or the Christmas spirit."
