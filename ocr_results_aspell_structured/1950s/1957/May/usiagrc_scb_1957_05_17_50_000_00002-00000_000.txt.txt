Vacant. TWO Positions

It seems customary, when an administrative official
leaves, to praise him if he has been well liked. If he has been
disliked, We employ some phrase like “We’ve had our ups
and downs, but We’ll part friends,” Many students seem
to feel that it is just as well that Dean Grace is leaving,
and it might be interesting to question why they are one
willing to go even as far as “parting friends.”

Dean Grace has met With disapproval of the students
because he tried to change the college conception of the
office of dean of men. In contrast to the old idea of the
dean of men as a disciplinarian in sneakers, he has tried
to make it an office job. One of his important tasks, as he
saw it, was to learn from the students their ideas; habits
and problems, and represent them to the faculty and ad—
ministration. The other, and perhaps larger part of his 391)
as he conceived it Was encouragement of personal, academic,
and vocational counseling.

An old style dean of men is expected to assume that the
C of HP is unwilling or unable to enforce rules, and at times
the group has shown this assumption to be valid. Dean
Grace has made a point of assuming that the C of HP will
handle discipline He has also encouraged the group to
emphasize individual problems, but the hall presidents have
felt their duties lie in administrative functions.

Grinnell college seems unable to accept the idea of a
dean of men as primarily a counselor, and probably it is
not the duty of a men's governing group to act as the tool
of such a counselor. Because of these attitudes, Dean Grace
has met with antagonism. It is nonetheless true that we
have a serious lack of orientation toward counseling in the
present administrative setup.

Counseling is not coddling. Faculty and administration
members who think it is are ignorant. Because of their high
intelligence (not in spite of it), Grinnell students need an
opportunity for guidance. Also, faculty members need to
have the interests and problems of students put before them
by an able spokesman. Dean Grace recognized this void in
our setup and tried to fill it while playing the conflicting
part of dean of men. Thus, he has filled two positions,
but has been prevented from doing either well. It is likely
that his successor will satisfy the old idea of dean of men
better than he. But, if Grinnell students are to get the
most out of their opportunities, it is vital that the void
Dean Grace tried to fill be recognized.

Foibles Of Old Are Rung Out
As New Dial Phones Ring In

By Arlene Cleveland

The new telephone systeln, designed to go into effect
next Tuesday, has as its main advantage the fact that it

works. .

In previous years, as parts became ineffective, it was
merely a matter of replacing, literally piling temporary piec-
ing upon temporary piecing to make the phones operate. So,

at a cost of approximately
$75,000, a new electronic system
of dldl phones has been in~
stalled on the Grinnell campus.

in 1867, the phone business be-
came more extensive in Iowa

For those of you at the Wed-
nesday Coffeeshour who were
more interested in the track-
meet Outside the window, here's
a sports note:

Ted Williams had tough luck
lhc other day. He struck out,
ﬂied out, and hit into a double
play,

I like Ted Williams. I like
him best when he's had, or
course, coach, no real profes-
sional athlete with a true
sense oi professional sports—
Inanship and love of the game
would ever think of showing
his contempt for the crowd.

But thinking is something we
don’t usually attribute to pro—
fessionel athletes, anyway.

Ted is obviously troubled by
such questions as: What does
that crowd mean to me? What
is professional sportsmanship.
anyway? Is there such s thing?
Am i in the wrong business?

See, coach? Thinking.

And I rccl especially good
this week about the Central
committee,

as independent companies came
into existence. Grinnell college
even had its own system, run by
four 24-volt storage batteries.

in those days, “Switch” w‘as
found in Main. Another pro,»
duct of the times was the
telephone itself, a thing which
come in parts and had to be
assembled by you. (Picture
this being done by a group of
dailies at d Monday nite house
meeting.)

About ten years ago when
”Switch” was moved to its pres-
ent home, the action also consti-
tuled a complete relocation of
all underground cables. The pro-
moters behind the “Operation
to the Heating Plant” neglected
to take into consideration the
effect on the cables. Consequent-
ly, one rainy morning found the
cables stretched, and Grinnell
campus not only detached from
the outside world, but even from
itself. _

Mummy lo the Rescue ,

It was at this time that the
administration called on a 're-
tired telephone man to come to
the rescueis George Mummy.
Mr. Mummy came, found the
trouble, and gave an estimate
on what it would cost to be red
paired. The college came, found
the price tag, and asked Mr.
Mummy it he could stick
around for a couple of years,
“just in case,” as nothing new
could be afforded at the moc
ment.

That was ten years ago and
Mr. Mummy is still here.

Come next Tuesday, the
new cables, switchboard, and
dial telephones will be ready
