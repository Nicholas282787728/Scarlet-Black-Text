Growing Pains

Editorial writers of past 3&3 Commencement i ‘ues
have insisted that each year has ”good," or at least “in—
tci'estillg.” Probably the best way to describe this year is
ill terms of growing pains.

The development program in the midst of a growing
supply of prospective students is the most notable aspect of
the ear. in the beginning students were enthusiastic about
plz's for expansion of the enrollment and methods for
in gillg‘ to the college resources for all intensive building
program. However, the prospect oi~ radical changes lnEV‘It‘a‘
bl): caught up witll student supporters and they became
dubious.

The present underclassmen came to Grinnell at a time
when there was plenty of room, and the Admissions office
opened the doors to any student with desirable qualifica—
tio In the past year, however, it has become evident that
a 1sing population is catching up with ollr colleges and
Ill! ersities. Experts in the field expect a national crisis
ill iig'her education within a few years.

I While remaining committed to the idea of a small col-
] ' the administration has tried to do its part in ans—
we mg. the increasing demand by giving qualified students
an opportunity to be educated. At the same time the de,
r iopment program was getting a firm start. The impres—
sion retained by students as a result of all this activity in
new areas was that the student body was getting lost in
the shuffle. With memories of a previous administration,
in which their wishes were in fact not considered, students
protested loudly.

To their surprise, the protests w 'e met by Varied
efiol'ts to inform students, discover their suggestions for
college plans, and, in several instances, incorporate their
pr ferences into the plans. Thus, the first adjustments were

,le in a lnanner satisfactory to the majority.

However. it appears that the outlook includes growing
pains ill more fundamental areas, The expected large jump
in enrollment will change many student relationships. Un-
desclassmen will return and find it difficult to adjust to
maximum use of the available space, when they have been
1 ed to more space per person. We are promised much
i ‘Jroved facilities, which may be a beginning toward ale
lel'lating‘ growing pains of the futurej

Whether this, the beginning of a period of change,
has been a “good” year can be judged only on the basis of
ac'lJustments which will he made ill the future, If the coir
lege goals are eventually met, that fact will indicate that
the years in which the changes were being made have been
successful.
