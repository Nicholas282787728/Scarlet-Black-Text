An Old Hope Realized

A letter just mailed by the Chamber of Commerce to
parents of new students says in part: ”The Grinnell Cham—
ber of Commerce would like to express its congratulations
to you as parents of Grinnell students for choosing Grin-
rlell as their college . . i If there is anything we can do
to be of service to you, or if there is any way we can make
your v it more pleasant, please let us know.“

With such a letter comes indication of the revolution
which has been taking place in Grinnell “town—gown" re-
lations. It used to be that college students made a habit of
false alarms to the fire department, property-damaging
bonfires, etc, Townspeople replied by taking potshots at
the students, fist-fighting them, etc. When the cartoon
printed above first appeared in a 1949 S&B, it was hoped
that one small step had been taken away from the “be
fore” situation. We can now hope that we are firmly settled
in the “after”.

It is significant that in this period of growth for the
college the town seems to be supporting us completely and
growing with us, New store fronts, paved streets on the
outskirts of town, and the new municipal swimming pool, and
the continuing work of the committee for encouraging new
industry to come to Grinnell indicate to us that the college
can be proud to be located in the city of Grinnell.

Few of us will spend our lives in Grinnell, but while we
are here we acquire a special interest in the town, which
will stay with us as long as do our college memories. For
years this interest has been crippled by misunderstand-
ings. Now new relations appear to be putting the college

and town in proper perspective — as part of the same

community.

Hats off to south campus! By deciding to pool their
funds toward it float and platform decorations for the queen,
they have contributed toward making Homecoming day a
success, It remains to be seen whether the men can succeed
in preventing their hall decorations from cheapening the
entire weekend.

The health committee has
suggested that Asian flu is
most easily spread by the
breath: roommates catch it
from roommates, they say,
and “close friends" catch it
from “close friends."

A sly, clever, and slightly
entertaining way of saying that
someone has been up to no
good . , .

America’s favorite grandfa—

I know that the Soviet Union
can just shoot a rocket farther

Tensions Mouni As Temps Soar;
Entire Campus Hides From ‘Bug'

By Arlene Cleveland

Do you know how many people have Asian flu? I
don‘t know either. Rumor has it that Haines first is under
quarantine, most of the men in Cowles are under suspicion
(for the disease and other things), and the majority of
people are under the weather.

lo new
business!

Have you ever seen anything as ugly as a person

with the Asian flu?
motley bathrobes, sweaty fore
heads and tangled hair, the
gleam in their beady eyes that
says “I’m going to breaﬂle on

of the healthy campus flee in
horror.

Not that one minds carrying

‘ trays, taking temperatures and

washing telephones, but the
mental agony of “why doesn’t it
hit me" is sheer torture. All
your friends have it; your class-
es are getting smaller; the lunch
lines are getting shorter; you
begin to lock suspiciously at
anyone who sneezes, coughs at
even carries a kleenex. You
walk alone; you tiptoe in the
dorm; you close your door and
lean against it thinking “whewx'

All of a sudden you hate the
people who have had flu shots;
you envy the ones lucky
enough to be in the infirm-
ary; and you despise the peo-
ple next door to you who are
sick. But there is the happy
thought of: cheer up_it
could have been bubonic
plague.

To top the situation off, the
football team, which was among
the first to gel. flu shots, finds
itself with nine men weakened
by the disease. Likewise, the
s and 13 staff has depreciated
by one—third due to the illness
to say nothing of the Cyclone’s
problems which means trying to
take pictures of the healthy few
who meekly struggle to look

like an organization. Seems as

Overlooking their greenish complexions,

if they just won't let photog<
raphers in the infirmary to get
the group clustered about the
sickdbeds. .

However drastic these meas-
ures seem, the worst from the
social standpoint is the cancellac
tion of Quad open house: no
open-open house on first floors
(this also means no cleaning-up
of rooms which will make a few
girls happier but not necessarily
healthier), nothing in the
lounges, no cookies and punch,
no talent show, nothing in the
Quad at all. But the dance will
go on in the Women’s gym, at
least the germs will be able to
mix to music.

There is a special announce-
ment for those of you who de-
sire to contact this disease: the
infirmary is publishing an up-
to-date newssheet, with avail-
able statistics, enabling you to
choose what symptoms you
want from whom, who will he
on tray service during the days
you are sick, and a list to Sign
so you can have your own

friends take your temperature.

As a special attraction during
Convocation weekend, the ROTC
men will be selling Honor G
sandwiches and aspirin at a
Friars coffee hour entitled “How
High Was Your Temperature,"
led by Bob Mchmsey, his ther-
mometer and his physician.
