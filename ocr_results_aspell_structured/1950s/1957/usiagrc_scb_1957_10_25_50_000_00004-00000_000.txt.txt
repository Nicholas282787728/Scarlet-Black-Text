Our Contribution

On the surface this weekend is “American Culture at
h’iid»Celltllry,” with a few sidelights. Tlle great ideas pre—
sented by tile speeches and panels will leave all of us with
food for discussion and thought ill tlle months to come. But
to our guestsiparents, alumni and friends—this will be a
good chance for another look at Grinnell college. And that is
.11 I’lere the Sidelig’llts and behindstlle-scenes el'i'ort comes in.

The Convocation is a huge undertaking, and the stus
dents' part seems small. But the choir which tonight accom—
panies Duncan, Greene, and Matlleson has worked three
times its usual amount recently, trying to reach :1 profes-
sional level of perforn‘lallce. The students in “Doctor Faus—
tlis" have barely made it to classes for the last two weeks.
The Scarlet and Black stafl', the people planning the dance,
and students assigned to various odd jobs ovel this \1 eeltend
have “Ollied on the Convocation to the exclusion of studies.

The percentage of students spending- most of their time
Working on this weekend is small. However, the student body
ll .ls supported the Convocation ill many ways. Books by the
speakers have been read ill preparation for the ideas which
will be presented. Panel discussions have been well attended,
Nel‘y few are going home foi"“t‘he holidays."
