March 8, I957

By “’3“. Jacobson
It was like the roof caving
in. Irv Simone’s varsity
swim team was forced to set‘
tie for a second place in the
conference meet last week.

With their three me cham-
pionship on the line the Pio—
neers did as well as expected
in every event. Four new
names went on the record
hoard, three or them belong-
ing to Grinnellians.

Robb Madgott. in winning liis‘
second straight diving cham-
plonsliip established new vars—
ity, p001, and conference rec-
ords in amassing 1681 points
Saturday morning.

Jim Jacobson, our only other
first place winner, established
a new conierencc mark in the
200 yard backstroke at 2:23.33.
And Dean Crocker lowered a
1955 record of 2:37 for 200
yards of breastroking t0 2: 3.5.

Yet the whole story might
be summed up in a few words
— too much Knox.

In a. dramatic affair which
quickly turned into a dual
meet between the Pioneers
and Siwash the new champinns
irorn Galesburg walked on
with “Dilly" (the prized con-
ierence trophy), and compli-
ments for having the strongest
team in Midwest history.

Down to the last event, Si-
mone’s crew needed a win to
tie for the crown. An 0:54 loo
yard leg of the ireestylc relay
by Knox's Clopper was too
much to cope with, however
and. the meet ended, the dif-

ference being one body’s length.

The Pioneers captured one
more medal than did the Si-
wash; but this was a story of
individual .stars rather than
depthr Cn-captain niu Sim-
mons won a second place
award in the 22011111 free
style and finished third in
the 440. And Chuck mwtrey
won fifth and fourth place
medals respectively in the
two distance races.

The big surprise, (and looking
to next year a very encour-
aging one) was returning vet
Bob» Grindey's third place finish
in the 200 yard breaststroke,
The 21—year old sophomore
iinished on the heels of team—
mate Dean Cracker,

Pioneer sprinters Dick Bres»
nahan and Jon Walker managed
a couple of thirds in tht- 160
and 60 yard ireestyle events,

The boys looked good, as

good as they looked all year
in compiling an impressive won—
lost record which included a
four point viotorygover Knox
in January.
