Tennis Team Smashes (Zoe 7-0;

Powerful Omaha

Next Opponent

The tennis team will play host to the'Univel‘sity of
Omaha next Wednesday afternoon in the fifth dual match

of the current season.
The Pioneers have won

four straight, most recently

downing Coe here last Wednesday, 7-0, but the team has
yet to face a real test. Omaha, with four returning letter-
men from a squad that beat Grinnell last year, 4-3, is ex-

pected to provide sufficient
competition to see just how
good the Pioneer netters are.

This week’s victory over
Coe was highlighted by the
continuing ﬁne play of Dick
Katz, sophomore, who is now
in the number one spot after
defeating Bill Hahn, another
promising sophomore, in' a
challenge earlier this week.
Jim Hautzinger and Larry
Koch, as the two veterans of
the squad were, as usual, re-
liable in their performances

Larry Lauer, who moved into
the number tive position by vir-
tue of a challenge victory over
Dave Leavenworth, had little
trouble with his Cce opponent.

Coach er Simone, in his
iii-st year as tennis coach,
seems well satisfied with the
singles play but he is still ex-
perimenﬁng with various
doubles combinations. “We
seem to be coming along pret-
1y well, hllt the next few
weeks will tell. If we cut be
ready {or Omaha and Iowa
State (May 9) we ought to be
tough for the Centerence
meet at Knox on May 17, 18."
said Irv, following the Coe
match. ,
Simone is a coach noted for

'having championship teams at
Grinnell and the group of men
on the ’57 tennis team might be
another example; at any rate,
when Conference time comes
around they should be ready.

Drake Relays Attract Thinclads

By Noel Bacchus
Today and tomorrow at the 48th Annual Drake Relays
members of the Grinnell track squad will be brushing
shoulders with more than 1000 athletes from all over the

United States.

Triangular Victory
Over Cornell, Knox

By Larry Schalegel‘

Grinnell’s defending con-
ference track champions
slowed down Cornell’s bid
for this year‘s crown with a
narrow 67~62 victory at Cola
nell last Wednesday. Knox
was third in the triangular
meet: with 33 points.

Both Grim-loll and Cornell
captured seven firsts, Cornell
coming. as expected, in the
sprints and middle distances.
Sam Fetroff and Joe Conley
were double winners for the Pio-
neers, Petroff in the shot‘ and
javelin and Conley in the high
and low hurdle races.

other individual winners
for Grinnell were John welden
in the mile, his first attempt
at that distance this season;
George Susens in the high
jump with a six-foot effort;
and Larry Schaleger in the
two-mile.

Cornell’s Charlie Bray, the
fastest man in the Midwest com,
ference, was unchallenged in
winning both the ion and 220-
yard dashes. nick’raul and Don
Henderson gave the Rams first
money in the quarter and half-
mile runs respectively. Jerry
Moore copped the broad jump.

Knox managed two firsts, one
a tie. in the pole vault siwash-
er Jim Roberts and Ram Harold
Barnett both cleared 11-6. In
the discus Jim Stowell got otf a
winning toss of 122-9 for Knox.

Grinnell’s fast-improving
track squad split up last
week'end with one segment
competing at the Kansas Re-
lays at Lawrence, Han, and
the other traveling to Iowa
state Teachers for the annual
running of the Teacher‘s he-
lays.

At the Kansas Relays Coach

Larry Schaleger in the college
division of the twormile relay.

Petroff’s performance in the
two~day ten-event decathion was
very satisfying. Sam finished
sixth in the field, winning the
discus and javelin and finishing
second in the shot. Had Sam
been training the last two
months with only the decathlon
in mind, he could have doubt-
lessly performed even better.

In the two-mile relay, Grin-
ncll's ioursome finished sev-
enth against the best compe-
tition in the country. The
squad turned in a time at
:14 which was just short of
the school record which is
mos (not 8:18 as previously
reported).

The Teachers meet was pri-
marily to get as many team
members as possible into com-
petition. Grinnell looked good in
qualifying for the sprint relays
and hurdle shuttles, but pulled
muscles to several key perform-
ers snorted all chance tor a high
place.
