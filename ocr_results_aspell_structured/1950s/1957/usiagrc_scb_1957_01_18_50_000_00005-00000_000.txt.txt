lnvading Northfield, Minn,
this weekend, Grinnell college‘s
basketball team will be scram-
bling to get back on the right
side of the Midwest conference
ledger following Monday night’s
loss at Coe. The Pioneers, now
3.4 in the loop, will play at
Carleton Friday and at St. Olaf
Saturday.

Carleton, currently with a
3—3 Midwest mark, will be far
vored on its home floor, while
st. Olaf, now 2-4, is given a
lesser pro—game advantage,

with two centers still out of
,.action because of injuries, coach
John A. pfitsch expects to al—
ternate several players in the
pivot spot. Bob Mchmsey is out
for the season with a shoulder
separation. and George Susens
is not expected back until the
second semester following a
severe ankle sprain.
in view of their perform-
ance in the last two games,
the Pioneers will have to
show considerable improvea
ment in their capture of re-
bounds to defeat either Carle—
ton or st. Olaf. Also, despite
an improved shooting perform-
ance in the (Joe game, the
squad still has a long way to
go before attaining the stand-
ard of accuracy displayed by
the top conference teams.
With almost half of the con
ference season over, the Pioneer
squad will have to return a
high majority of victories in its
remaining games to rank among
the top three teams of the 1956s
57 conference ratings.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Swimmers To Face Cornell;

Swamp I St. 'Olal, Carleton

Riding on the crest of a
,wave that swamped both St.
Olaf and Carleton last week»
end, the varsity Swim team
will play host to Cornell to-
morrow afternoon at 1:30. '

The Rams from Mt. Vernon
will be led by Phil Mayberry,
conference 220 and 440 yard
freestyling champ. However,
they aren't expected to be in
the same class with Simone’s
speedy outfit which, in North-
field last Friday, knocked off st.
Olaf by more than 20 points,
and then on Saturday averaged
a ’56 loss to Carleton by beating
the Knights 56 to 40.

In an attempt to stop Mays
berry tomorrow Simone will go
along with ceacaptain Bill Sims
mons who walked off with four
first places last weekend, win-
ning the 220 and 440 yard races
in both strange pools. The Pio-
neer distance man finished seer
ond to Cornell's ace m the 11-
lap event and third in the 22»
lap race in the contcrence cham-
pionships last March.

Tomorrow’s contest will be

the first Midwest affair in the
Grinnell pool this year. In
the Pioneer’s other swim meet
here this season they were
touched out in the last relay
by Nebraska university. Since
then they have won two and
lost none, upping their per-
centage to .666.

In commenting on his squad

ISimone said, “After the Nebras-

and two consecutive
victories under adverse condir
trons (strange pools and disqual»

iflcations) We Should be flexible\when

enough now to bend our knees
.and shoot the bucket!”

Having little doubt about beat.
ing the Cornell team, Simone
is planning on juggling his line-
up in an attempt to . . . “see
exactly what we've got for the
,big one next Week” (with high.
lly touted Knox). The Pioneer
,coach has a lot of talent to deal
lwith and will probably have
lmany of his boys swimming
strange events for testing pur-
poses. The Knox group, on
paper, appears to be the strong-
est in the conference. “We’ll

In this business where shift-

Simone will use the times
made tomorrow in establishing
a lineup '30 face Knox next
week, The dim yard medley
relay is a new event this
year and will be worth 12
points to the winner in the cone
ference meet. Walt Jacobson,
nean Crocker, Jim Jacobson
and Dick Bresnahan swam it
against Nebraska, there were
two different co binations
used at Northfield, an simone
is expected to swim a fourth
combination tomorrow in an
attempt to cover the distance
in less than 2:25.

The relay includes five laps

Soph ‘bl'eaststroke ace Crockr
er and sprinter Bresnahan will
carry a bulk of the load in the
meets coming up. “Crock," who
has already neared the confer-
ence record and has broken
Grinnell's 200 yard conventional
record, is off the “ailment list”
now and will be ready to swim
two or three events.

Friday, Jan. 25, is the date
for swim fans to remember:

Next week Knox college
will bring one of the tough-
“t swimming teams in con—
ference history to the Pin-
neer pool.

Simone and company have
been working towards, and
preparing for, this meet since
practice began in November.
The Pioneer swimmers will
have their hands more than
full on the 25th.

Simone will carry a two-
meet winning streak into the
swimming highlight of the
year next Friday. Knox is
undefeated. It will be close
down to the last event—and
will likely serve as notice as
to what will happen in the
‘57 conference meet.

in Simone's words: “A dual
meet win over Knox here
would make our conference
chances look good. On paper
it looks like an awful lot of
horses for Knox—but we’re
going to hang toughll"

Unbeaten Kohawks
Top Midwest Race

Still undefeated both in con-
ference and nonconference play,
Coe‘s Kohawks are perched sol~
idly atop the Midwest teams,
and are threatening to make a
runaway race of it. Having
beaten Carleton and St. Olaf
over the weekend, Coe has met
and vanquished every team in
the league except Cornell. These
two ouintets meet on Thursday
at Mt. Vernon, with the Kor
hawks favored to win.

A clean sweep of the Wis-
consin entries gave Monmouth
undisputed possession of second
place and enabled Knox to
jump from a seventheplace tie
to a third-place tie with the
Cornell Rams, who beat Grina
hell and St. Olaf, but lost to
Carleton. The Pioneers and the
Carls, with identical three-three
records share the fifth spot. The
week’s double losers—St, Olaf,
Ripon and Lawrenckbring up
the rear in that order.

The leaguerleading» Kohawks
had little trouble with the Min—
nesota quintets, building up a
léapoinl. halftime lead in both
contests and stretching the mar-
gin to 17 points by game's end.
A1 Pursell scored 15 points
against st. Olaf and 23 against
Carleton.
