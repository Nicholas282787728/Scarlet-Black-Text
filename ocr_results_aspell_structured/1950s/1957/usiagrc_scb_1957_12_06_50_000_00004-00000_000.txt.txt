he the subject or a panel dis»
cususion by President Howard
R. Bowen, Harold L. Clapp
(French), Joseph D. Daniorth
(chemistry) and John C. Daw-

Shearing Review
Cont. from p. 3
noted that Mr. Sheariug’s cele-
brated improvised fugues are
neither improvised nor fugues.
The more exact term should be
rugati, a term used for fugue.
lilre compositions.

Shearing has discovered at
least one successful method to
give coherence to his music. The
typical jazz procedure is to pre-
sent a series of variations on a,
melody, usually of the wellel
known variety, but he carefully!
states this melody in a literal,‘-
straightforward fashion at the
beginning and end of the piece.
if a great number of variations
are to be made. a literal state-
ment may also appcar period.
ically throughout. As a result, a
simple type of thematic sym-
mcntry is given to an otherwise
formiess, strophic procedure.

Wednesday night the audience
might well have questioned thel
success of Shedring's music inl
such an austere atmosphere asl
that of Darby gymnasium. The
medium seems to demand more
intimate surroundings in which
such extremes of amplification
(at times ovcrbearingly strident
in Darby) would not be neces-
sary. One might go so far as to
say that the style is not entire-
ly compatible with a state of
complete sobriety, and that a
slight deadening of the nerve
ends might contribute to a tuner
appreciation of the Shearing
idiom.

Despite those who rejected his
craft, Shearing was able to on.
tertain a great number of his
listeners. To many, the music
was immediately stimulating,
and appealing J. s. Bach’s tlcct-
ing, often spasmodic appearances
in Black Satin, were less suc-
cessful. Must jazz be so preten-
tiously intellectual? Some opin—
ion to the contrary notwithr
standing, Mr. shearing revealed
little evidence of having de-
veloped a new twentieth—century
art form.

Prepping Poll

way supplied no reason or dis—
cussion. Still, many quotable
ideas appeared from amidst the
dissenters.

A North Younker freshman:
“If Grinnell is going to have a
fraternity type prepping pro-
gram they should throw out the
restrictions on fraternities. They’
won’t affect me because I’m a
‘GD!’ anyway. I had a lot of3
fun during prepping and I know
most people don’t take comments
seriously, but just the same I
can’t see that it servcd any pur-

pose.”
