pci-forming his duties, John is a
three year member or the Men's

program editor during the ioot-
ball season. The members of last
year’s wrestling team named him
captain and he shoucd his leads
ci-siiip by inspiring them to
fourth place in the conference
meet.

It’s quite a teat lor an ath-
lete, especially one with as
little experience as John had,
to capture three successive
medals. He finished third at
123 pounds each of his three
years as a varsity groppler.

His biggest thrill: “When we
ﬁnished second in the confer—
ence incct at St, Olaf last season
after a dismal dual incct sea-
son." Being a triple-letter wine
nor in one sport, ,lohn will now
be given his choice of a blank-
et or iacket.

“I feel that competition in its
self does a great dcal in build—
ing a mans character. 1 know
that wrestling is one of the few
sports in which a small man has
equal opportunity, since he is
competing with men his own
SIZE.”

7 “BB" hails from East st.
Louis, 111. He attendcd Caho—
kin Coniinoniicld high school
where he participated in base-
ball lor two years and foot-
liall for one. He comes from a
large family at twelve broth—
us and sisters, who are :ill
married.

When asked why he choose

"I felt that l

legc close to home. Also I knew

,tllat since Grirwell didn’t cm'»

phasize athletics I would have

'the chance to try my luck at a

sport that was new and differ—
ent. I never wrcstlcd before
coming here 1 also knew that
with the reputation Grillnell has
I couldn’t go wrong in obtaining
the best in education."

John is at Grinncll on the
Vanneck loundation scholars
ship. This scholarship is given
each year by John Vllllneck to
one son and one daughter of
