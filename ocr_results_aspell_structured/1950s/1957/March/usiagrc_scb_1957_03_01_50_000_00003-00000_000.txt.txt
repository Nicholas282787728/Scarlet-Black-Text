“Student government is be-
ginning to amount to something,
but its success can only come
from the students themselves,"
stated Bob Mchmsey, incoming

The installation. attended
by about thirty students, was
the iirst oi its kind in re-
cent years and must “build up
its own tradition," according to
Art Travers, outgoing student
Council president.

Travers stressed the import—
ance of the individuals respon-

sibility in expressing his opin-
ion concerning student govern-
ment, “The representatives know
the truth and can take it to the
students; we will not have to
worry about jags,“ Travers con-
cluded.

in his acceptance speech,
Mchmsey promised to under—
take the responsibility of put—
ting into etfect his platiorm
and emphasized the import—
ance or the cooperation and
interest oi the student body in
the aiiairs of the council.
\The installation service saw
the climax of one of the closest
elections in six years, according
to Travers. The election, last
Monday, drew in per cent of the
student body to the polls, in

ror with his receiving 344 votes
