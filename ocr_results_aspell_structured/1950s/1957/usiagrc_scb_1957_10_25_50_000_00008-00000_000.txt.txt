Technical Effects, Faustus Encounters The Devil Sweeney Produces Art Interpretation
Including Soda-Psychological lnfluence

Well-Trained Cast
Highlight ‘Faustus'

By Sue Bertie '

The allention of the Convo-
cation audience at “Doctor
Faustus" is not directed toward
“how it comes out." The story
was an old one betore Mar—
lowc’s time, so that his script
was an attempt speciﬁcally also
signed to amuse an Elizabethan
audicnce, which was. in tact,
probably more receptive to the
dramatization of the Faust
legend than are many of us
here this weekend, Thus, al—

though Ned Donahoc's adapta» _

tion of the story is not one es
pecially revised for the 20th
century (as was, for example,
the Broadway version, “Damn
Yankees"), our interest now
must be focused on the innova—
tions in theatrios of this pro-
duction.

As the ﬁrst major presenta—
tion in Herrick chapel in some
years, the design and technical
work ol Richard Meyer point
up the va iety of eneets which,
with imagination and artistry.
can be accomplished with Grlne
nell campus facilities and man
power. Meyer has used what he
calls “space-staging,” in which
light is used to deﬁne space,
and series ot levels used to
maximize stage area. Technicale
ly, “Doctor Faustus” is a ﬁne
achievement, with the lighting
particularly impressive.
Donahoe's work with his
cast is also.rcmarkable. llc
has made use of both expe-
rienced and beginning actors,
and has come up with a little

"It is ctcar that within the

or the individual dancers are
pleasant, they over-crowd the
stage during their appearances.

"Doctor Fauslus" is ccrtainly
a positive contribution to this
Convocation; though one might

contemporary American “Ab-
stract Expr ~ionist" visual
artist has gained the respect
oi countries that have always
had a inherent painting trae
anion—that there is a ioreigii
awareness rather than aloof-
ness towards our iorms or art.

Statements likeI these, accent-
ctl by new descriptive words
and terms, have Caused Sween-
cy's associates to call him a man
of independent taste (“more in-
dependent than a hog on ice")7
in his capacity of critic, leetn
er, exhibition adviser and inter

As a word to the wise, Mn.
Sweeney has said, “The sinews
for approach to vital contem-
porary art are best formed by
training in the great works of
the past For the term ‘art’ cam
not be properly used for a single
work or art in isolation.”
