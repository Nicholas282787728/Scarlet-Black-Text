Varsity, Frosh Mermen Compete
In Minn. U. Invitational Tourney

by Mbb’

Madge“

Today the Griniiell swimming team is on its way to
Minneapolis, Minn. to participate in the Minnesota Univer-
sity time trials. This is the first time that the Pioneers
have received an invitation to the meet, and they are the
first non-Minnesota team to participate.

The reason for the change from the usual Knox relays
is the fact that the freshmen will have a better chance

to show how they will fare un- '

der regular varsity competition.
It also will give coach Irv Si-
mone a better idea of how his
varsity will do in the regular
season, which opens next Satur-
day against Lawrence in Apple-
ton, Wis.

The freshman team will be
competing with the varsity in
open events rather than in a few
relay events. The Knox Relays
also conflicted with the Law-
rence meet. Simone feels that
this meet has done a lot to moti<
Vate the Varsity and has done
even more in motivating the
freshmen. Both squads are rar-
ther along at this time than
ever before, according to Simone.

There is one newcomer to
the varsity line-uni He is Tom
Castles who is working with
Dave Allen and Jack Shaffer
on the diving hoard. Simone
says that Tom has had very
little experience on the board,
but, with a lot of work, he
could blossom into a good
diver.

One change has taken place in
the choosing of the conference
champion. The coveted ”Dilly
the Duck” trophy will go to the

tion. Cowies with 22 points
was foil-owed by Rawson with
17 and South with 15. The
outcome or the meet remained
undecided until the comple-
tion of the ﬁnal event, the
loo-yard free-style relay. The
winning Cowles team was pac-
ed by freshman Mike Watkins
who won the 40-yard free
style, loo-yard free style, and
was a member of the winning
relay team.

to provide more interrcompeti-
tion before the conierence meet.
There will be a team champion
chosen as a result of the big
meet held in March. The winner
of this meet will receive some
type of trophy not yet decided on
by the conference members.
Co-cnptsins for this year's
swim team are Bob Grindey
and Jim Jauohson. Both are
hard workers and should prove
to be very worthy or their
honor. Simone reels that the
squad itself used very good
judgement in its choice.

The freshman team chose Stan '

Norman as its captain Stan is
a good free style man, who, ac-
cording to Simone, will show
Grinnell swim fans a great deal
in the next four years.

Grapplers Open 57—58 Seaso

In Knox Invitational Tourney

A young, potentially tough
Grinnell wrestling team opens
another grappilng season to-
morrow at the annual Knox
Invitational meet at Gales
burg, Ill. The Grinnell mat-
men will be competing
against Knox, Monmouth and
last year’s Winner, Coe, in a
quadrangular meet.

This year’s varsity squad in-
cludes four sophomores and
three juniors, and boasts only
two returning lettermen: Bruce
Wilkerson, heavyweight, and
Jerry Cooke, in the lao-pound
class.

“We are looking forward to
a good season this year as we
build toward a stronger and
more experienced squad for
next year," stated Coach Bob
Peterson. Looking at this

year's Conierence prospects,
Peterson oited the Carleton,
Coe, Cornell and st. Olaf
teams as being extremely good,
thus making the competition
in the upper bracket stiii.

Wrestlers in tomorrow’s quad
rangular meet are Jerry Cook
in tho laoepound class, Dad
Millar at 137, Axis Yianibas i
the 147-pound class, Roy Simp
son in the 157 slat, Fred Heiber
ger at 167, Dave Van Anrooy a
177, and Wrestling at heavy
weight, Bruce Wilkerson. Grin
nell will forfeit in the 123-poun
class.
