‘ °On Welcoming

This evening a large proportion of the student body
will participate in welcoming three Hungarian students to
Grinnell college life) We are proud to be part of a nation-
Wide response to the protest of the Hungarian people against
living conditions which involved no freedom. And we are
anxious to assure lthese new students that we are glad they
are becoming a part of our campus life. These are theprins
cipal motives behind the student reception at the train.

Since we have at Grinllell students from all over the
United States and from several other countries, our pattern
of welcome to new students changes very little with the
distance they come. They first get to know the people liv-
ing near them and their hall members, and gradually they
become acquainted with other students and other aspects
of tile college. \

Although the unusual reasons for which Judy, Mike,
and George come to Grinnell have .made more public their
first introduction to the college, the basic pattern of gradual
acquaintance with college life is still necessary. Through
this pattern all new students become members of the col-
lege community during the years they are here.

In the enthusiasm of welcoming our newest students,
we must be cautious of overlooking the real-place of the wel-
come as part of a gradual introduction to the whole college.

Definition Of Terms

_ In discussions of the Scarlet and Black, we have been
impressed by a general misunderstanding of the functions
of news stories, columns and editorials.»

The news, compiled completely separate from any edi-
torial opinion, is an attempt to present all the important
facts as they are known. Reporters get these facts from
authoritative sources, but not from private conversation or
closed meetings. The position of any particular story in the
paper is a general indication of its importance and interest
in relation to the other stories in that issue.

Columns are not effected by policies of the paper. In-
tended to be opinionated, they make no attempts to present
the news. l

Unsigned editollials, the views of the editor, are at-
tempts to present responsible opinions. Letters to the editor
are in one respect guest editorials, opportunities to present
views. » 1

SCARLET AND BLACK

Sackclolh
And ,
Ashes

By Gene Thompson

The Grinncll College “News"
that is posted on your hall bulles
tin boards, the brain—child of
what is probably the most un—
secret ”news agency" on ,the
campus is startling in its puerilc
use of language.

It’s “story” On the arrival of
the Hungarian students I can
only describe as being straight
out, of the seventh grade. “Join
the crowd." and “See you there!”
it bubbles. And its editorial pol-
icy consists of ddyocaung the
March of Dimes and KGRW.

This sheet has much to say
about nothing and says much
that should not be said at all.
It is completely irresponsible in
its use of the students’ last
names.

‘ Why should they have to be
”prepared” for their welcome?

And I lmaglne there are others
who feel (like l do) that they
are ‘weary of wading through
reams of inconsequential infor—
mation and non-information in

an effort to find out what's on

at the movies.

Over a period of time, every girl studies the art of

in selecting just the right bean and in trying a firm long-
lasting knot. You must always put your heart into your

To the Editor:

We are, evidently. among the
complainers mentioned so often
on the Grinnell campus and in
the Grinnell publications, i.e.,
Scarlet and Black.

One of the favorite topics of
discussion, it would seem, is
the dating situation, There- is
one small point that We would
like to make. Namely, MOST
girls are interested in fellows
only as friends. We are not.uut
tor a husband, steady, etc, What
most men do not realize is that
we are interested in them as l
people _ people with dilferent
interests, ideas, and diverse
points or View.
