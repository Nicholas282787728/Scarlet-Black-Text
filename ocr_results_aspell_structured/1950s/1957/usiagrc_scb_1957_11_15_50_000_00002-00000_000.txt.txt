The Social Coordinating committee supervis

the men’s budgets and activities are administered. And

Of course, the Women‘s Way is obviously more com- reservations
fortable. There are just enough extra salaries being paid,
and just enough red tape involved, to insure that the same
old traditional way will keep them plodding along at essen
tially the same old pace. (A rather obvious example: on

through his affection for young
people, his pride in a job well

“History ls Evidence 0f God’s Will,"
Concludes Gales Lecturer Harbison

E Harris Harbison, professor of history at Princeton
univelsity, this week delivered the Gates lectures on the
topic “Christianity and the Meaning of History.” Instead
of the usual five lectures, the series consisted of three

lectures and two coffee hours.

In his first lecture, delivered Monday morning, Harbi-

son pointed out that the periods of greatest historical

thought come at moments of
great crisis or triumph, when
man turns to the past to dis-
oover how he got where he is.
He indicated that the three
highest pomts in Christian his.
torical thinking came at such
times: the breaking up of the
Roman empire in the time of
Augustine, the Protestant ref»
urination, and the twentieth
century with its wars and de.
pression It is with these three
periods that be dealt in the
three lectures.

In this first talk, entitled
“Classical and Christian Con-
cepls,” he developed the
‘Graeoo—Roman theory of his-
tory as a never-ending cycle,
constantly repeating itself, and
the opposing Hebraic-Chris-
tiim concept of history as a
straight line, with a definite
beginning, middle and end.
The former view he termed
pessimistic because of its sense
that all is determined by late,
the latter optimistic because
it sees providence working
through history to a specific
goal.

in Tuesday's lecture on “The
Protestant Reformation,” Harb-
ison began by sketching the
medieval view that history was
being worked out visibly in the
church itself, and that the
culmination of history was to
be found in those times. This led
to the idea that individual
events were of little importance,
and to an interest in the mira-
culuus rather than the factual,

The Renaissance brought a
renewed interest in fact, and
the realization that the world,
far from being almost over, was
seeing the dawn of a new era.

Luther and the Reformation
Christians refuted the medieval
idea that God’s will in history
was being worked out only
through the church, claiming
that it was present, though
hidden, in all historical events.
Their main contribution to the
Christian concept of history,
stated Harbison, lies in their
refusal to accept either the
meaninglessness of the classical
cyclical view of history or the
progressivist view that the
meaning of history is worked
out visibly, and their insistence

on the importance and unique-

ness of historical events.

On Wednesday morning, in
his concluding ' lecture ’on’
“Twentieth Century Christian-
ity," Harbison traced the
movement of historical theory
from. the conception of God
as the prime mover of history
through that of man as prime
mover and then the theory of
inevitable natural progress,
ending in the disillusionment
brought about by the two
world wars and the depres—

sion of the twentieth century.
He divided modern historical

thinkers into the three cate-
gories or pessimists, progressi-
vists, and p‘aradoxists, placing
such contemporary Christian
thinkers as Niebuhr and Her-
bert Butterfield in the third
group. These men hold that one
can neither claim that progress
is inevitable and secular events
the end of history, noi- deny
the importance of individual
events.

This modern Christian view,
which Harbison sees as the
most valid interpretation of his-
tory, holds that “history does
have significance and meaning
as evidence of God’s will, but
His will is never made com-
pletely evident in history,” and
warns against making moral
judgements of historical events.

To the Editor:

It’s amazing what noise twene
ty students can make.

Monmouth went into last Sat-
urday’s game with a 0-6 win-
loss record, and came out with
a 0-7 record, and the fact that
the goose egg would not change
was never in doubt.

But still, twenty Monmouth
students drove for four hours
to support their luckiess team
with shouting and determina-
tion the like of which 1 have
only witnessed once at Grin-
nell—two years ago when a
few students went to 009 to
a basketball game.

i expected the skimpy tum-
out fol‘ the game. The last home
game always has had poor at
tendance. It was an expectation
which I hoped would be wrong
-—lt Wasn’t. Nonetheless, the poor
turnout was no excuse for those
of us who were there to let our
selves be out-shouted lby twen-
ty Monmouth students! And it
seemed to me that they did out-
shout us, time after time.

I feel sorry for the team.
Grlunell is sixth in the con-
ference, but did any of us
drive (I realize that only apa-
thctlo seniors have (airs) to
Knox (the same distance as
Monmouth) to See the Pioneers
play? Did we have a good
turnout tor a game we were
expected to win, and with a
skip day in sight too? Did we
shout our lungs out so that
the team wouldn’t even know
there were Monmouth fans
here? Three questions but one
answer—no,

There are no excuses. I only
thank Monmouth for showing us
where We are.
