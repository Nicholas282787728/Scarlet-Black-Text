ible range. hey will disinter
grate small animals and are
used for measuring purposes.

Music majors have to do a
long paper, plus. Carol Colby
presented a program of Bach
organ music in Herrick chapel
recently, and wrote a thesis on
the philosophy and music of
Bach.

Projects from Experience
.cheral honors students got
ideas for their proiccts through
their own personal experience.
There is John stoessinger, him-
self a refugee from Austria and
later from China, who did his
work on the “Rehabilitation and
Reintegration of Second World
War Refugees."

 

istry is being done by Dave
Mooberry and Keith Rowlcy.
The Navy research program in
colleges and universities has the
objective of promoting basic re.
search in the physical sciences.

Mooberry and Rowley are ins
vestigating the reasons why,
when oil is passed over plain
silica or alumina, nothing hap-
pens. 0n the other hand, when
the two elements are chemical—
ly compounded, and oil is pour.
ed over them, the yield is gaso-
line.

Besides receiving four hours
honors credit tor their work,
the two men are being paid by
the Navy. ‘Mr, Joseph Daiirorth,
in charge of the program, stated,
“Both men have contributed
significantly to the Navy Res
search Program at the college.
Grinnell is fortunate in having
such a 'program."
