Pioneers Give Beloit Scare, But fLoose, 77-75

John Pfitsch’s Pioneers scared
Beloit several shades oi delicatei
green before being nosed out‘
by the defending champions 777
75 in a spectacular contest last
Friday night in Darby gym.

it was the 29th straight Con-
ference win for Dolph Stanley's
team and their 12th victory
against two losses this season.
Thc visitors' eroint triumph
was their closest conference
scrape in three years.

An inspired Grinnell outtit
stayed within range of the Buc-
caneers during the iirst 20 min
utes, but the Pioneers’ big push
came in the second half after
Beloit had spurted to a 55.45
edge in the opening three min-
utes of that period.

Led by Dave Dunlop. the Pi .
neers clawed away at the ma -
gin to pull up slowly . . . 60755.
74766, 7568, 75-77 and finally
7745 with a minute left to play.
In the latter part of the Grinr
nell surge. Beioit had proceeded
to slow down the pace of the
game. The Pioneers pressed
against this stall, but despite the
tine work of Chet Lacy, Walt
Pokoj, et al, Beloit protected

its lead.

Grilmell hit 53% of its shots
and the Bucs finished with an
average of 46%. The visitors
made 55% of their tries count
in the first half to Grinnell's
44%, to lead zit the midway
point 43-39.

The Pioneers led briefly in a
sizzling opening period are and
10-8, but after tying things up
21-21, the Bontemps Athletic
Club moved ahead for good. BEA
lolt resorted to its pressing-zone
defense when the contest was
only a few minutes old.

Dave Dunlop emerged as high
point man for the evening with
21 markers, one better than Ron
Bontemps. leading conference
scorer, who had averaged 33.6
points in three orevious Midr
west games The Beioit star Cole
lected 16 points in the first half
but, due to the Efforts of Bob
Bigelow, could only make two
baskets in the final portion of
the contest.

Bontemps broke his own
single game conference scoring
record of 34 points when he
poured in 38 against Cue in De-
cember. '

Grinnell’s Bigzlow gathered 18
points, some of them on spark-
ling bank shots. Earl Feisnerl
netted 12 as did ”Gas"'Saun—
‘ders. who made his debut as a
long shot artist,

Although the Beioit center
cooled‘ off in the ﬁnal half.
“Sour" Anderson and "Baby“
Baptist Contributed 20 points
between them during this time
to keep the Bucs out in front

The defeat was Gl‘innell's sec-
ond loss in three'league starts.

By Aloysius O‘Regnn
Dolph Stanley, Beloit basket—
ball mentor, explained the great
difference between the Pioneers'
pci-iormance last Friday night
and the 86736 rout sutlered by
Grinnell at Beloit during the
194349 season in this way:
"Gl‘innell played more inspired
hall and a smarter game all
around than was the case last
time . -. . The home court adv
vantage and every one of
Ptitsch's boys being “up" (or the
contest also helped to make it
a very interesting cvcning . . .
I hope Grinneil didn’t leave its
season out on the court though."

The Scarlet and Black cagers
played a great game against one
of the better small college teams
in the country and can claim a
moral victory it there ever was
one . , . Thus leave us pass a
nosegay to the court squad . . .

in our opinion only Ripon,
which laces two sessions with
Beloit, has the slightest chance
oi slowing clown the Bucancers.
