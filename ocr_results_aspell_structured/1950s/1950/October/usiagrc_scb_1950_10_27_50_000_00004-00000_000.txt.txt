Homecoming at Grinnell col-
lege this year will mean a lit.
: c something extra to one group
c-' girls on the campus. On Oct.
s, members and alumni ol
Women's Honor G will have a
h~eakiast and a ceremonial
I lining of the mortgage of the
loner G cabin.

Ever since the cabin was built
by an energetic group ot girls
12 years ago, members or Warns
ea Honor G, honorary athletic
and scholastic organiaztion, have
\.orked to pay for it. Profits
tom concessions at tootball and
baksetball games, prep cap sales
aid food sales in
ltive all helped meet expenses.

Located about two miles
northwest of Grinnell, the 15 by

to spend their weekends. And it
' a popular place too, for it has
ady been used several times
t'i fall and is booked through
ins weekend.
