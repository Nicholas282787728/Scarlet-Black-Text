‘Bonyata,

Although finishing in third
place behind Beloit and Mons
mouth, coach Burl Berry’s Pia-l
neer tliinclads showed up well
in the conference meet last Sat.
urday at Mount Vernon.'lohn
Bonyata and Hugh Acton turns
ed in the top Grinnell perform.
ances, Acton setting a new rece
era in the 88!) run with a time
of 1:56 and Bonyata winning
the lo yard and the 220-yard
dashes for the fourth year in a
row.

Bonyata’s four year sweep,‘
made possible because of war
time eligibility rules, estabilshed‘
a monopoly unique in the con—‘
ferencc history.- The Pioneer,
dash ace holds the league rec»
ords in both his specialties. Ac~
ton, always a consistent point
winner, ran his top college race
in setting his new mark,

Laurels

Coach Berry also had words
of praise for Steve Hitchcock,
senior dash man, who placed
seconcl to Bonyata in the 100,
and third in the 220. Hitchcock,
facing teammate Bonyata in
most 01 his college races and‘
therefore not often in the first
spot, has been a valuable point
winner in both individual and:
relay races, as well as high
jumping for the Pioneers.

The team results presented‘
few surprises, as Beloit rolled
up 531/2 points to 45% points‘
for second place Monmouth. Thel
Pioneers totaled 351/2 points, for
third, with Ripon in fourth
place, chalking up 22.

Other Pioneer point winners
were Torn Gage, third in the
440, Gene Parker, third in the
