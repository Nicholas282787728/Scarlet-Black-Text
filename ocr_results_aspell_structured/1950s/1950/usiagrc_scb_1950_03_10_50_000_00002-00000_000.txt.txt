Great Words of Little Men

This week, our editorialists are resting up for the
strenuous three dztys ahead, licking their wounds and shak-
ing their heads over the untimely demise of their own can-
didate, Young Spellman’s ghost lingers fitfully around the
copy desk, wanders in and out of the KGRW studio, chant-
ing 10w moul'nful songs of victory and defeat, ﬂipping a
coin bearing three heads labeled “Rutherford," “Tzlylor”
and ”Bloug‘h,” _

The darn thing keeps landing on its edge; great filmy
tears come to the eyes of the mourning “Almost-ran" and
his voice whispers hollon'ly, “Whoooo’s gonna win . . . .
\Vhooo's?” In his last lucid moment before his departure,
young Spellman coughed fitflllly and whispered a sentence
we feel is destined to go down for all times to contemplate.
“May the best . . . (gasp) man . . . win! Excelsior!"

China.

The next lecture was on the
“Authoritarian Political Tradi—
tion of China," The Confucian
theories dominated China for
two thousand years, and the
concepts of the Emperor, and
of the philosopher-officials
which he formulated, have dom-
inated the Chinese government
until the revolution of 1911.
They show signs of continuing
their hold.

in discussing “China’s Re-
sponse to the Western Impact,”
Fairbank discussed the role of
trade in opening China to the
Western World. He went into
some detail as to the role of
opium in the original opening.

”The Chinese Communist
Rise to Power," he stated. to1-

The lectures culminated with
his final talk last night in Her-
rick Chapel, “What Should Our
New China Policy Be’!" His

possible, and persuade the na-
tions of Asia that we are friend-
ly, and a real democratic power
in the world
