What Price Coffee?

Eightrhundred people sipped coffee yesterday when
they might have drunk of a little insight.

Or if they weren’t drinking coffee they were sleeping
in their beds, or they were catching up on the studying
they didn’t do when they were drinking coffee 18 hours
earlier. Or maybe it was something else, What it was mat-
ters little. Those 800 students denied themselves the ad-
vantages of hearing one of the best speeches of their col-
lege days

After Mrs Paul Kuntz‘ Phi. Beta Kappa address in
chapel yesterday, several graying faculty members of long
standing were heard to agree that this speech was one of
the best to ever ring on Herrick chapel walls. It is not as
though it were such a shock that Mr. Kuntz‘ speech should
be thought-provoking and spirited; he has earned that rep—
utation. ‘

It is not as though students had no interest in the pro-
ceedings of the day; their friends were receiving scholar-
ship honors; passing students loitered outside the chapel to
learn the identity of the award-winners, _

It is not as though there were no spare moments; the
downtown cafes were filled with students on their weekly
outing

What is it?

lHas Herrick chapel acquired a mysterious stigma? Has
it become shrouded in an inexpressable Thursday morning
gloom making its entrance forboding?

Or perhaps the administration, the faculty, and the
interested students have not kept up with the times. Per—
haps lectures, choir music, recognition for jobs well done,
religion, and any of the host of things the chapel connot-
ates, have become unalteraloly passe.

If that is the situation, let’s face it, Let us insist up-
on the country club atmosphere Ml: Kuntz charges is per-
vading college life, Chapel can be abolished.

But if somewhere we have missed the boat, if we ac-
tually prefer taking an extra taste of the inspirational and
educational facilities offered us instead of ignoring them,

Unique Program ofConcerti
Given by Virtuosi Di Roma

By Jane Gaddis

The Virtuosi Di Roma presented Wednesday evening what
was probably one of the most unusual concerts ever heard in Grin»
nell. Their organization as a string orchestra, their choice of mu-
Si‘cf, and their presentation of it all served to heighten the unique
e ec.

A more diversified selection of numbers might have been less
wearing to the audience Nevertheless, Maestro Fasano conducted
the allrclassical program in a thoroughly refreshing manner. with
the instrumentalists giving the music warmth and purpose.

The faster movements of thei
five Vivaldi concerti were plays
ed in a bombastic and robust
fashion. The slow portions show-
ed an almost plaintive quality,
especially noticeable in the viola
d’amore solos of the D minor
concerto. "
