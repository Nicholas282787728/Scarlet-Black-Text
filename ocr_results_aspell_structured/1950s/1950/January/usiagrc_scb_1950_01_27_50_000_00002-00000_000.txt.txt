Brave New World? Maybe..

AS may possibly have been noted this issue of the
Scarlet and Black has been dedicated to the closing of a suc-
cessful Semester. We have tried to gather significant com-
ment from diverse sources in an attempt at appraisal of the
activities during the opening half of tlle 49-50 college year.

Generally speaking, we feel thatt he predominant note
of optimism is a chord well worth the listening. The world
of late, in which we each putter along with varying degrees
of effectiveness, is a place in which optinlism has ‘almost
hecolnie extinct. .Perhaps “obsolete” would be the better
\VOI‘ .
People, plain and fancy, have been brooding over the
fate of mankind in the atom age, the problem of the rising
tide of socialism, and the soaring price of coffee. They have
been plagued with election years, the red menace, and the
decline of Hollywood. There are, of course, the eternal ivor-
ries about grades, dates, and finance.

But it would seem, from our round-up of campus opin-
ion, that here at Grinnell we may have the basis for a pro
toplasmic bit of optimism. We are cooperating with one
another apparently. We are achieving an unusual level of
maturity. Things for us seem to be going along pretty
darn well. We’re getting along.

Sample note of our Brave New World Cantata: there
have come to our attention several suggestions that the stu~
dent body offer a rousing vote of thanks and confidence to
the foods department for the Wednesday night spread so
nicely timed to serve as a relaxation from the last minute
cramming blues.

We wish solemnly that we could have elemental bee
lief in the idea that the spirit of Grinnell as demonstrated
this semester would grow and flourish in a sort of math-
metical progression with each semester that follows, Per—
haps that is too much to ask. But at least it is a goal well

worthy of future study.

For New T-erm;
Sees CowIes. Life

Your reporter walked into
the 5&3 office last night to be
confronted with “find out what
you can about this fella from

Dutifully he walked over to
Cowles and, after hearing at
least six pronunciations oi his
name, stumbled into the club
room. The boys were having a
songfest (he entered to the
words “And a,gent1eman dap-
pcr . . . ) -

Making himself heard over the
din, he stated his purpose. A
quiet spectator sitting on a sofa
was pointed out to him. After
introductions, the twain fled to
a quiet room for an interview.

His Real Name

His name, it turned out, is
correctly spelled as Twaflq Sab.

ly as it is spelled.

since then in meeting the ad.

getting to know the boys in his
