A New Big Ten

Yesterday a student walked into Mrs. Pruyn’s officel
and asked if he might be permitted to donate some money
to a special fund. This special fund is one recently be-
gun for sending more "Chips” to Grinllellia scholarship
fund [or sons and daughters of Grinnellians.

This is the result of tlle celebration of Dr. Stevens’v
tenth year as president of Grinnell. Alumni, in recognition
of the excellent job he has done in such areas as replacing
retiring faculty with young professors, balancing the bride
get after devastating war years, seeing Darby, Cowles, and
Loose to colnpletion, felt it appropriate to cong atlllate him
in Tens—ten cents, tell fins, ten C’s, or “ten kind words,"
as Dean Strong expressed it.

We all respond warmly to unselfish action. It is cerv
tainly gratifying to see it displayed in this way by alumni;
we are grateful to the president for his gifts of his enel»
gies, his thinking, and his personal fortune which inspired
the alums. But we think the spirit of a campus which lnov-
ed a student to ask if he might be a part of the effort to
help others come here is especially significant.

We Asked for It

We of the S and B would like to say how nice it is of
whoever it is to pay heed to the Well-meant words of the
editors a few weeks back. We asked for sidewalks. Andi
what are We getting? Sidewalks!

Yes, as you read this very editorial, a sidewalk is in
the process of being built to course by the back door of the‘
Y building and the back door of the chapel, This forms al
complete circle with existing sidewalks and may be hence-
forth known as the Central Campus Promenade. We are
especially pleased at the consideration shown by the poll:
ers that be in waiting until the students are about to leave
the campus so that the workmen on this noble effort \l'on’t‘
be in the paths of busy students.

Such improvements give lls cause for great joy and
