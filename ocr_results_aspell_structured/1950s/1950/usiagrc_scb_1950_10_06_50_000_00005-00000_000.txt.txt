lLettermen Loss
Harries Harriers
At Season Start

Handicapped by the loss of
six lettermen, cross country
coach E. G. Booth is faced with
the task of building a winning:
team from a relatively greenl
squad.

The only two men with any
~cross country experience are vet.
‘crans, Brett Taylor and Ned
Jackson, and on the performances
of these two rest Grinnell's
hopes for a successful season.
Adding to Coach Booth’s prob-
lems is the fact that the her-
riers first meet will be with the
defending conference champion,
Lawrence, on October 14. Al-
though the prospects for this
year may not be too promising,
the fact that the team is mainly
composed of sophomores and
juniors gives promise a

_ of
brighter future.
