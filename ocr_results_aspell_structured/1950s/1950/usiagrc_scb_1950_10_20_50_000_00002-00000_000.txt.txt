Ice Cream Social?

The Sunday afternoon ice' cream social is a tradition

'el‘ytlling.r Sunday afternoon may be the time, but the
‘ary is not the place.

There are some students who find it necessary to study
in the library, even when the sun is shining and God is in

in iply themselves to their studies, despite the attractions of

And hum is euphemistic. The word maywell be roar when
enough time elapses to allow it to r h that pitch.

Letters

To the Editor:

with the exception of required
convocations, attendance at
Thursday chapels is entirely up
to the choice or the individual
students. as are religious mat»
ters in general at Grinnell.

Many students attend chapel
regularly. I ieel that those who
do not choose to go to, chapel
should not be penalized for their
choice by absence of library and
student union iccililies during
chapel hours.

It the administration wishes
to add to their reputition of be
ing a liberal school, they could
leave open during chapel hours
those facilities for study, refresh
ment and informal recreation
which are normally open to
students. .

Sincerely,
Merle Fischlowitz
