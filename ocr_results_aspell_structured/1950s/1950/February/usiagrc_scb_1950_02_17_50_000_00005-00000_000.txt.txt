While 1 was home over vaca-

noon with a fiiend oi mine in
Moline, 111., who is a real live
jazz expert. He has a collection
oI over 2,000 records and once
was a professional musician.

this bop question and he replied
that he thought bop
but alive! “Pure. ‘musician’s’
bop is dead," he said, “since it
could never appeal to any but a
select few, but the hop idea will
live on in a popularized form.”

Rumor (and Down Beat) has
it that Sarah Vaughn and Billy

Eckstine will out four duets for.

MGM. Should be something to
hear.

Theies a brand new rhythm
tune out called “Chattanooga
Shoe Shine Boy." It’s been getr
ting a big build—up on the radio
shows and might be a hit.

Four different people I talk-
ed with during vacation insisted
that the zither will be a big tad
in 1950. Well, we’ll see!

Students’ Paintings

From Art Director

An exhibition of paintings by
Grinnell students proved stimu-
lating to local artists and stu-
dents, said Miss Merer, direc-
tor of the Davenport Municipal
Art Gallery in a letter to the
Grinnell Art department.

The water colors and ink
paintings received many compli-
ments and attracted quite a
large number of Grinnell alum-
ni, she said,

Enclosed with the letter was
a newspaper clipping showing
two ”students looking at the exe
hibitloni Shown clearly in the
foreground were Richard Cer-
vene's ”Grandma’s House” and
“Summer Landscape."

The exhibition was in Decem-

Michael 1. English
university said in his address
,at chapel Thursday Father Eng—
liish spoke upon “Catholics and
the Bible." a concise straight
forward account of Catholic
,views

l Teaching was the important
1thing for Christ and the
‘apostles, Christ told them to
teach not write. Thus the Bible
is only an auxiliary, The spirit
of Christ was to “be with them
all days” and with the apostles
successors. Thus the successors
iof the apostles are the final
,authority. It is up to you to
,decide where the apostles sues
‘cessors exist now The Catho—
ilic church believes it is the
true apostolic successor.

Historically Authentia

“The Catholics hold to the
|historical authenticity of the
[gospelsﬂ’ said Father English.
E“We believe the four gospels
were written by their authors
in the first century”

put to the test of careful scru—
tiny like that which substantie
ates he new testament. Copies
of the gospels go back to the
fourth century. Fragments of
them have been found to have

centuries.

"Catholics hold that the Bible
.is the means of getting the
teaching, life, historical record
of Jesus Christ. it shows Christ
was the son oi God," Father
English stated.

“The old testament is the his-
tory of the Jewish people. The
Jews kept alive monotheism
which was a marvelous thing to
do with polytheistic peoples all
,around them The old testament
points toward the coming of a
Messiah, who would fill out
what was lacking between God
and man."
