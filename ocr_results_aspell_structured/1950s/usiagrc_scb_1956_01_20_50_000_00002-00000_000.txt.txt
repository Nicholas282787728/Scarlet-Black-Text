Needless to so}, something had to be written concern-

;g‘ certain “mischief“ that was done during last Saturday’s

, amural dance program. In a way we are sor ’, for this

exactly what the persons involved were looking for. Be-

‘tieell fouling up tlle tape on which was recorded all of

tile music, using pea shooters, and throwing tacks on tlle

t'tnce floor, they hoped to hear their names mentioned

‘ ‘ound the campus either personally or just as tllat “un-
i-‘lowll group." \

For some reason, it seems that olle hall is always pan
'trally responsible for these Cute little escapades. We are not
' dges that can say to what extent the members of Cowles
.. all should be punished or just what should be done with
tilem. They are not; publicity shy in any folm, for they
readily admit some of their activities in order, we believe,
to make themselves a name around the campus. They have
succeeded; we hope this is exactly wllat they deserve,

It is true that the dance IN is spoken of jokingly
.iong many of North campus, alld yet these Sallie men go
,lck each year to see the contest. 'et some llfll‘l'OW»miIlde(l

li duals feel it necessary to make it difficult for botll
._ erl’orlner and spectator to at least try to enjoy the works
‘- hicll are presented. These individuals don‘t care a bit
(bout the actual c'ontest hilt merely the “glory" which
t'luy seek.

To President Bowen and the

Grinnell Students:

Frlst or all, 1 wish to thank
Dr. Bowen for instituting his
round-table conference with
students. i feel that they have
been, and will cautmuc to be,
useful to both Dr. Bowen and
the students.

However, i have a que n to
as]; concerning the structure of
these round-tables; namely why
is it necessary for the r liege
deans to attend these ConieP
ences? Surely a {leer atmos-
phere would prevail, and the
students’ Opinions and ques»
tions could be more canaia. ii
the President's rollncltable for
students were‘ restricted to

certain that the cricriiicncss or.
and attendance at, these round-
tables would definitely increase
it the; were released from the
restraining ancl in toiling pre-
sense of the deans,

Therefore, 1 would like to
suggest that D Eowcu con.
duct a icw sessions Withoul the
presence of the college deans,
and see ii the round-tables are
not moi-c meaningl‘ul both to
Dr. Bowen and to the Grinnell
stiidi‘nts.
