‘ Wiener attempted to show
that the history of arts and
sciences is not, as the common
heliet asserts, apart as light
from darkness, but has develop-
ed as st single coordinated
whole.

He contended that the classic—
ism oi the 18th century was
just as much a classicism among
the arts as among the sciences.
in this period. where there was
little doubt as to what was so
and in which the arts asserted
the observed facts as incvitahle,
this outlook- carried over into
science with the teeliiig that
the world ot science was ObJeCr

as little personal prciudice as
possible. Geometry was destined

From this shaking ol the bar
