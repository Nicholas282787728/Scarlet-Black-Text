Rating Scales

“They can't be fixed."
“I guess that shows where he stands!”

All kinds of comments were heard this week after thel
teacher rating sheets were passed to the classes. Students’
opinions, unenlightened as many of them were, varied from
“It's a fine thing” or “I don’t like it” to “What have I
done?” '

Faculty members registered sympathetic reaction with
a genuine interest in making their teaching technique more
agreeable to students; a few ignorantly ridiculed psycho»
logical technique employed,

What will the ratings show? Primarily they will Show
what a student thinks of a teacher’s technique in the class-
room. This does not involve consideration of his teaching
as other teachers, administrators, or “experts” think lt
should be. It is solely student opinion.

The teacher will be given a score which may range
from a minus 36 to a plus 36. If he wishes to know how he
was scored on each specific item, the file of rating sheets
will be available to him.

“I beat the sheet" To make the rating sheet worth-
while the psychology department devised a means of scor~
ing them which minimized hasty over—valuation or underv
valuation of the teachers.

As a student looks over the test he can recognize fav»
orable and unfavorable statements. Pupils rating teachn
ers are urged to rate the teacher on the side of the ledger
he feels the teacher should be on—in other words, it is al
test which can’e be rigged because there is nothing to try
to 'slant (such as in the older vocational preference tests
in which a monotone can make himself into a potential
Caruso),

The mechanics of the test. The test was devised by Al
Rustebakke, '50, as his honors project. A representative;
;ample of seniors was asked to write essays on teachersl
they considered worst and best. The attributes which were
listed most often with the best teachers and the worst
teachers were those selected for this scale,

With aid from the psychology department, the relia—
bility and validity of each item was checked. A trial testl
was given to teachers on permanent tenure this year.

t

Anonymity. An elaborate means of protecting the all-
onymity of students and particularly teachers has been den
vised. Each teacher was given a sealed envelope with three
cards inside each card containing a code number. Only he
{nows the number which applies to him. When tests are
gradedtlle checker puts the code-number on each test so a
teachcrcanlook through thefileand know which test applies
:0 him. Each of the three cards is for each of his three
zlasses. Neither the administration nor the person correct»
ng the scale knows the teacher it rates.

An additional difficulty has presented itselfﬁthe
small class in which the teacher knows each of the students
;0 well that it will be possible to identify each by the data
Supplied concerning sex, grades, and class standing. This
will probably be rectified by blanking out personal data
after it is recorded for the use of the department. It is for
ascertaining the differences of scoring between the differ-
ent levels of students.

Although some students have felt dissatisfied with ’the l
test, we feel that a clarification of the principles upon
which it is based will make their attitudes more favorable
toward it. And regardless of the perfection of the scale at
this point, the psychology department and students who
have achieved the degree of excellence this far attained are
to be congratulated.
