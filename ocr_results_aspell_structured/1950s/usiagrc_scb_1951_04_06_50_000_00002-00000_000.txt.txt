To Apply Art

An excuse for being, a reason for a new lease on life,
was Suggested by a recent editorial in consideration of cam-
pus activity organizations. Here is a case in points

We have an Art League. What is it? What does it do?
Who is in it? _

There is a crying need on the campus for all art organi-
zationian organization of a different type from the exist-
ing one, but one which could fill a real purpose and justify
itself. The campus really needs a central agency to which
it can go for its art work.

A rank amateur is saddled with the job of preparing
posters to advertise a dance. What does he do? He Wastes
time running downtown buying paper, returns to discover
he’ll need a certain kind of paint brush. He finally asks
the most overworked man on campus to do "just a couple"
of posters because he happens to be the only available per-‘
son With a reputation for his art work.

It‘s a natural! A central agency upon Whose shoulder
bewildered publicity—hounds and general campus beautifiers
could cry is what we need. The organization could divvy up
the Work, supply talent, materials, suggestions, and sustain
itself with a reasonable fee for its service. Potential Van
Goghes to Dalis, how’s chances?

Council Activities
In Recent Meeting

By Jane Bugby

Conferences, past and iuture,
hampered the workings of the
Student Council on campus at
its meeting in Clark Hall yess
zerday.

With representatives from
Dibble, Smith, Cleveland and
James, as well as class officers
and C of HP representatives ab-
sent. the discussions were
hardly representative of the
student body. An enlightening
report from Herb Huebsch was
the highlight of the meeting.
Reporting on a conference
which he and three others had
attended on “Discrimination,”
Herb told the Council that dis—
in colleges was
common “on the basis of race.
creed, religion, national origin,
sex, or political views.” Wheths
er the Grinnull campus is
guilty of any of these, the
Council did not decide,

a Negro professor whose ap-
plication to Grinnell had been
refused.

A conference to be held May_
4 and 5 in Town City was dis-
cussed, and after much discus—
sion, no definite plan was
reached as to how many dele-
gates to send. The vote was
unanimous to send delegates.

President Jim Morgan, in
view of the absence of a num-

ed on the duties of a Student
Council representative. His
three points were: 1) He
should resign if he hasn’t the
time; 2) the system falls down
if he isn‘t at meetings; and 3)
the Council is justified in re
placing habitually absent mem»
bers.
