Council Approves

New Honor Sys'l'em
/Goes +0 S’ruclenl's
I ——

An honor system worked 0V7
or for two years has been okay-
ed by the Student council. The
honor system committee,
ed by Dave Mooberry, will pre-j

sent the plan to student vote in
the near future.

When Frank Sanders was
president of student council stur
dents were polled and found to
be in favor of resuming an hone
or system. Lorrie Becker was
committee chairman until her
graduation
berry then moved up as chai
man.

Next week on Wednesday or
Thursday copies of the proposed
honor system will be circulated
among the students with an
open discussion for its explana
tion and clarification following
in the near future. A student
vote on the proposed system
will follow. If 34 of the student
body approves, the plan will
be presented to the faculty.

lo a University of Utah poll
of honor system policies in
American universities and col<
leges, so per cent of the private
colleges poued had an honor
system. or these private col-
leges William and Mary have
had such a system since 1779;
Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, and
Washington and Lee, since they
began; Princeton, since 1393;
Oberlin, since 1909; California
Tech, since 1910; Reed, since
1511; Stanford, since 1919.

The poll showed honor sys
tems to be more common in
private colleges than in public
universities, to succeed best in
small colleges where they are
upheld by tradition. The most
frequent cause of abandonment
of an honor system was found to
be lack of student cooperation.
