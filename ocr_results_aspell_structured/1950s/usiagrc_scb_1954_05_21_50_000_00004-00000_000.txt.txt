Outstanding sophs

Grinnell’s title hopes rest upon
the ability of Several of their
performers to equal their best
competitive efforts of the year
in order to gain those all im-

Grinnellians not only have the
best times in the conference this
year but are also close to or

are Bob Phelps in the javelin,

‘Pioneer Trackmen Invade Ripon
For'Midwest Conference Meet

Seventeen Grinnell thinclads are at Ripon, Wisconsin,
this weekend, where they will compete in the annual Mid—
west Conference track meet.
balance the Pioneers are rated as one of the top three

Because of their allearound

The battle for the top three spots promises to be a
close one as both defending champ Carleton and Knox have

Ionds oi: the mile standard.

Potential Point-Genus

Two other Pioneers have the
top loop marks in the pole vault
and the two mile run. Vaulter
Clyde Greeno has topped all
other: with a leap of 12’6” and
IDave Qutub’s 10:21.6 clocking is
ten seconds under that of his
nearest rival. Recently Greene
has been having trouble finding
his way over the bar, but should
lhe return to his old form he
will have little trouble in re-
taining the vault crown he wonl
last year. ,

Several other Grinnell stars
tare close to the top in their
irespective events. Qutub has
‘the third best mile clocking as
does Drake in the 380 yd. run.
Jim Kingland, a second place
finisher last year, is right he-
,hind Drake in this event. Quar—
ltet—miler Frank Hays is‘ only
‘three tenths or a second off the
Jtop 440 mark.

l Strong in Hurdle:

Hurdlers Bud Huesrler and
Chuck .Westrup are both well
up in the top spots in‘ the 120
‘ydl highs and the latter has
lskimmed the 220 laws in the
third best time of the yearr
Another soph, shot putter Tom
>Boe stands a chance or picking
'up some points in that event.
1 Relay Squaﬂ.Weakemid

Grinnell’s championship mile
relay squad has a real challenge
_to its supremecy from a strong
iCarleton quartet which finish-
ed second last year, Two memv
hers, Lyn Stacy and Foster
Rineiort, are gone from last
year’s outfit and the Carls have
bested Grimell’s best effort by
a good five seconds, The Pio—

Ihest in the loop.
