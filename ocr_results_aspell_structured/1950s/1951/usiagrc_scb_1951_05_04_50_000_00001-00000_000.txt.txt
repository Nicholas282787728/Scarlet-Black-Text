Durham Takes Double Honors;
Guest Writers Spark Coniab

By Kay Swartz

John Durham barIacks senior, walked away wIth $130 and
double honors In the wIitIng contests last Saturday, getting first
prize for his poetry and short story entrIes.

A political science major, Alan
poetry III the second place spot. The third prize of $50 in that dis
vIsIon went to Bob Bredeson, Smith senior.
each went to Bill McGuire, barracks senior;
UnIon sophomore, and Jim Kissane, Smith junior. Bob Vas Dias,
Langan sophomore and Leavenworth won honorable mention in

the short story divisIon.

The prize wInning entries were
discussed in the afternoon by
judges Karl Shapiro, editor of
“Poetry” magazine, and Robert
Penn Warren. author of the cur
rent best-seller ”World Enough
and Time.” Warren’s discussion
centered around his criteria for
a good short story, Shapiro con—
fIned himself mainly to discus-

sion of the specific poems enterr

ed in the Contests.

Calls Pyle Great

Morning sessions of the Writ.
ers’ Conference were seminars
launched at 9 a In. by The Des
Moines Register journalist George
MIlls. His kindly air, belying the
movie hat-on-in-theshouse type of
reporter, was brought out as he
answered questions from the
group. He read from the writings
of a reporter whom he said could
be considered a great writer,
though not the author of poetry
or fiction. This was Ernie Pyle.

“Green-eyed, red~headed” Rob-
ert Penn Warren in a violet
jacket packed thelhouse at In a.m.
His talk was based mainly
around one Student’s question,
“What can you learn from Wilr
liam Faulkner?” Contrasting
Eaulkner with the “hurrah for
America” novelists and the so-
cial conscience Writers(”gootl for
people with a small and rather
harmless type of monomania"),
he said Faulkner was not jour—
nalistic and casual, but critical
of our world. Said Pulitzer prize
winner Warren of Nobel prize
winner Faulkner, “He's good be-
cause he’s intelligent."

Answering one student’s ques-
tion, “What is the best way to
sell a storyl" the Kentuckian
drawled, “Well, you have to have
some stamps. i suppose you
write it and pray.”

Shapiro Unaffected

Karl Shapiro looked more like
a reporter than reporter Mills—
or at least he was not the stereo-
typed eccentric or dreamy—eyed
poet, but an unaffected, quietly
intelligent. man.

In talking about interpretation
of poetry, he gave one example
of over-reading when a poem
about his wedding, in which he
wore a khaki uniform and his
wife was dressed in blue, was
interpreted as a prophecy of the

merger of the-armed forces.
He stressed consideration of a
poet's life in understanding his
work. He brought out the idea
that it is unlikely that a man
in an emotional turmoil about
himself could be a good poet;
his self—centeredness would be
likely to make him immune to,
the outside world.
‘ PrIzes weren't all the short
story winners received. The
three men received notice from
Robert Penn Warrell’s- literary
agent that their works would be
welcomed by the agent for read—

authors frequently have much
trouble In obtaining an agent,
that is a “real break” they said.
