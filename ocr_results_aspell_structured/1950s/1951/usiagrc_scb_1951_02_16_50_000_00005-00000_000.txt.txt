loop, Will be out to avenge the,
6550 loss at Galesburg less than
a month ago, Grinnell will enter
the fray without having lost a
conterence game on their home
floor thus far in the season.
Knox is fortunate in that the
first six men on the squad, who
see most of the action, are all
good ball handlers and dead
shots. A glimpse at the‘ previous
game with Knox this seasonl
shows that the six men who saw‘
action e Hill, Johnson, Hanks,
Miller, Lnndeen, and Dredge 7
posted scoring totals from a Hit
point high to a 7 point low.
The lllinois boys, having play.
ed ten home games to four visit»

have a total record of ten wins
and four losses. Two of the
losses have been to teams which
have also defeated Grinnell: Bee,
loit and Coe,
Knox is currently tied with.
Carleton in third place, each;
carrying a 5—2 mark in league:

position, may ruin their 6-2
standing tonight when they play.

the position to make a try for}
the second slot. :

Knox, so if comparison can be
used, the Scarlet and Black

should take the Knoxians in
stride.

The Feds B team is rated as
good as any A squad Grinnell
meets all vear. The Tutors are
coached by Dave McCuskey,
whose 1950 team won the na-
tional championship, annexing
the AAU and NCAA titles

tavus Adolphus, 49.26, at ,St.
Peter, Minn. This year Knox is
somewhat of an unknown quane
tity while Gustavus Adolphus,
who was just barely edged by
a powerful Carleton squad, is
definitely a potent threat. Last
year against Gustavus, Gi‘lnnell’s
“Skip” Kingery set a new pool
diving record in scoring 246‘
points, One of the more later
‘estmg aspects or the Gustavus
Adolphus meet will be the clash
between Jack Edgren, star Pio-
neer freeostylel‘, and the Gusties'
crack 220 man.

Scarlet and Black lost a tough
match 49.35 to the Buccaneer
