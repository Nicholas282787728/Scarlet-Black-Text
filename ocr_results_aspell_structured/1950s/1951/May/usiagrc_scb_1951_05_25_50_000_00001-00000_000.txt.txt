Houser Discusses

lParable ot Nails'
For Final Chapel

At the last chapci oi the
school year Thursday, Dr. Char—
les M. Houser delivered an 3dr
dess entitled, “The Parable of
the Nails."

Dr. Houser, minister of the
Plymouth Congregational church
of Des Moines, said that Jesus
frequently used the parable to
put his teaching on a level that
would be familiar to all, This
symbolism in terms of everyday
objects was used by Dr. Houser
in the parable of the nail.

Dr. Houser contended that to
build a house one needs nails
that-will he staunch and will
hold things together securely.
From this he continued by say—
ing that Christians can hold the
world together. They need to
find religious nails to bring
meaning and unity to life, for
good Christians can stand up
under the pounding Circumstanr
ces and fulfill those tasks they
are meant to do.

At the close of the speech. Dr.
Houser quoted Christ as saying
“Keep our life on the sensitive
side and be aware of the forces

around us.” This too. Can fit in:

with the parable, for the nail is
always attracted by the force of
the magnet.
