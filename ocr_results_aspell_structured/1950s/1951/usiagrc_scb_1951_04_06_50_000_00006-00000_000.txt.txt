Aboul New Slal'e Commission

,By Andy Billingsley

State representative of Power
shiek county, George Pau a
Grinnell alumnus, was vis ng
speaker in Mr. C. Edwin Gil»
mour‘s state government class
Saturday morning.

Serving his second full term,
in the Iowa legislature, Mr, Pauli
is chairman of the Siftlng; Cum-l
mittee thraugh which all bills
must pass to be placed on the
House agenda He was also a
member or the much publicized
“little H o o v e i Goininission
which conducted a study on re
organization of Iowa state gel/a
eminent.

Pointing out that the last re i
organization in the state gov—ern
ment was in 1923 Mr Paul said}
that the annual budget for the
state government is Over a hun-i
dred million. “It is the biggestl
business in the state,” he said.
Because the legislature should:
always keep strict contrg over‘.
the purse strings the chiet job
of the “little Hoover Commis»
sion" was to reexamine the
spending policies and practices,
of the administrative agencies. l

“Reorganization is nothing
new," he said, “ it has just been
given special. impetus afteri
World War II. Thirty—six states.‘
according .to the speaker, have
instituted some kind of reorgae
nization program since the war.

“Some states have felt it nec»
essary to call a constitutional
convention,” he said, “but in
Iowa, we felt that a commis—
sion of senators and represen—
tatives could better do the job,
because we are familiar with
the workings of government."

This legislative committee.
served as a policy making body,

and hired expert investigators to ,

do the actual field Work.

So far the only recommenda-
tiun made by the commission
which has become law is the one
