SCARLET AND BLACK

Hanlpi'on S’rudenis Praise.
. Criiicize Grinnell wiih Scru’riny

By Margaret Hyden
lowa weather and scenery
, may not equal that of Virginia,
but much of Grinnell's campus
life compares favorably with
that of Hampton Institute.

This opinion is shared by Nora
ina Mitchner and Caldoria (Cal)
Lewis, both Hampton sopho»
mores and enrolled in Grinnell
for this semester.

Norma, whose home is in Bal-
timore, Md., is a physical educa-
tion major and is president of
Hampton’s dance club. She is
also an active participant in the
WRA, the art club. and is a
pledge to Delta Sigma Theta sor
rority. Currently Norma is dan-
cing in the Gadabout’s musical.
“Then Was This Island” and is
a member of Orchesis.

Cal, a home economics-educar
tion major, comes from Monte
gomery, Ala. She is active in
Hampton's choir, home econom-
ics club, the Student Christian
Association and is also a pledge
to the Delta Sigma Theta. Since
she has been at Grinnell, Cal
has been a member of the choir,
glee club, League of Women
Voters, world relatedness com-

Cal has been impressed by
student interest in national and
international affairs at Grinnell.
She added, “I like the idea of
students initiating things, like
this musical" Norma observed
that authority is centered more
in the students instead of in the
administration, as is the case at
Hampton. , '

From the social angle, both
girls think the co-ed dining at
Hampton is superior to the meal
system at Grinnell. More of the
dances at Hampton are infor—

 

mal and boys and girls are in
clined to mix.

Both girls are enjoying their
classes and the professors at
Grinnell but qualified this state~
ment with the observation that
some of the teachers are a little
too dogmatic.

Flowers Dancers
Arrange Conceri‘

Of Dance Hisiory

Hampered by \he inexperience
of two members of her troupe
who had been with the Flowers
dancers only four days. and two
high school girls, the audience
waited for something which
never quite came off, at the cone
cert series program Monday
night.

In stressing “Bamboula to
Bop", Miss Flowers unfortun-
ately picked two of the show’s
weakest numbers. The real inr
nate ability of the dancers was
evident in ”Breakdown,” a jamr
session in dance, which provide
ed the best Charleston we’ve
seen in a day of Charleston rer
vivals, and “Voodoo Maignan”
which captured the intensity
and characteristic movement and
feeling which the Negro has
contributed to the world oi
dance.

A Creole dance was tempestui

ous and inspired with some hu-
mor.

The program, which would
have been aided by more effeCr
tive announcing, was arranged
to show historically, the Negros
particular contributions in the
dancing field.
