Now is the Time . . .

The time for student government to assert itself for
the benefit of the students and college has come. We see
in President Samuel N. Stevens’ 10 p. in. homecoming edict
an opportunity for effectively settling the often posed ques-
tion: Does student government have any power to work for
the good of the college community?

President Stevens seems to feel that preparations for
homecoming decorations should cease at 10 p. m. on Fri-
day, Nov. 2. He gave as his reason a statement from the
athletic department that noise from students at work kept
the football players from sleeping and may have contribut-
ed to last year’s defeat.

We have, however, consulted the athletic department
They said President Stevens must have misunderstood their

’request that the team spend the night before homecoming
at an outof-town hotel. Their idea was to instill the impor—
tance of winning the game in the younger members of the
squad. Their idea had nothing to do with noise.

We all want the team to win. None of us would feel
right if we contributed in any way to their defeat. We are
not willing, however, that our loyalty be played upon just
to have what must be termed a quieter homecoming.

The C of HP, after much consideration of the edict has
come to the conclusion that such an order would prove un-
satisfactory. They recommend that men be permitted to
work on displays throughout the night. It is the council's
contention that such work will make it much easier for the
house councils to maintain order.

Considerable time has been spent by the members of
the C of HP in dealing with the problem They feel that
their recommendation will work for the benefit of the en—
tire community. We are in agreement with them.

Lf their recommendation is refused, the answer to the
question of the power and effectiveness of student govern-
ment will be quite evident. N C

1 Notes to You

A note of congratulation to the nine girls who have
.been selected as candidates for homecoming queen.

A note of admonition to south siders who waste food.
Waiters and waitresses in the quad dining room advise that
anyone can refuse food at breakfast and lunch. If you don’t
care for it, just say so.

‘A note of thanks to Paul Kuntz for his interesting and
peltinent sermon Sunday. We congratulate him for speak-
ing to us as adults. We should have more speeches and ser-
mons delivered in such a manner. We appreciate them.

A note of helpfulness to those concerned about the new
out system. Any time spent in the infirmaries will be re-
corded. At the end of the semester if a student has more
.than 22 Cuts including absences for brief illnesses, those
illnesses will be considered, Thus if someone‘is ill, the best
idea is to go to the infil‘mary.

To the editors:

Next Monday all of us are
going to have a chance to cons
tribute to one of the most im~
portant project; now being car-
ried on in our country—the
World Student Service Fund.

In connection with 22 other
national committees we are
helping to rebuild universities
devastated by war, The great
importance of this program can
not be overstressed, as we can
hardly hope for world peace un-
less We educate the people. The
WSSF not only helps provide
books, typewriters, and other
equipment for schools, but also
gives studenls food, clolhing, and
a place lo sleep, so that they
may take advantage of educa—
lional opportunities.

We may feel that lhis project
is so far removed from us that
we can have no interesl in it.
But once you are in Europe and
have a chance lo meet and know
the students in lheir own homes,
it is possible to realize that Eur-
ope is truly very close to us.
sludents all over the world have
the same ideas and slandards
as we, and I hope that each one

To the editors:

A comparison of present is

an improvement. This improve
ment does not seem lo extend

find a definite lack of construe

The editorials of the last three

senl lhe height of negalive lhink-
ing. With few exceptions, they
are critical wilhoul being col-ls

In lhe‘edilorial concerning the

presented its faults rather do

of onwarsided writing is npl lo

Perhaps it would be .wise for

comparable republic, lhe worst,
I often suspect, is that which
confuses the funclion of critir
Cism . . .with the function of
reform, Almost invariably it
takes the form of a protest: ‘The

coo and snivel the sweet ones:
so wags the nalipnal tongue .

and hence capable of tickling
the emotions by leaping lbs in-

of course, there is nothing but a

empty babbling of men who cons

If an atom bomb were lo sfrsy
this way and go off in my face,
I'd hate to be found slumped
over a typewriter knocking cul
a hot column on the fiasco that
homecoming looks like it’s go—
ing lo be. A guy can get so
wrapped up in some of the hem
sense that goes on around here
that lie forgcls about the rest
of the world: However. 1 finally
found time from my frantic so-
cial, political, and academic life
(sigh) to listen to the radio and
read my copy of Time.

It‘s too bad that history prov
fessors can't live forever so that
they could be around to chuckle
when all of their prediclions
come true. If there were six of
lhem they could serve as pall-
bearers for the rest of us. Rev
mind me to chsnge my major.

The wrelch who stole lhe flag
right off the pole must feel the
same way about the future that
I do. If crooks and imbecilcs
continue to run our Country
and our lives, a well—preserved
Copy of the Stars and Stripes
might soon be a valuable col-
lector’s item. That fellow might
do well to stash away a Bible
and a bolllc of Iowa corn liquor,
too. They bolh seem headed
loward extinction.

People are gelling pinned and
engaged; house presidents are
being kidnapped; the halls are
missing from the Pulls’s pickel
,fcnce; the freshman class has
selected a leader; the clocks in
ARH are still flve minules ahead
l of the world—slusrge; last year’
grads hate the Army; and the
English are in danger of losing
the Suez canal. The police action
in Korea is going as well as can
be expected, and it’s a long
walk to Tama or Newton. India
and Pakhislsn aren’t speaking.

You can see that lhings are
grim and that the third world
war is just around the corner,
so let’s hil lhosc books and not
get loo drunk at homecoming.
_Too much depends on it.
