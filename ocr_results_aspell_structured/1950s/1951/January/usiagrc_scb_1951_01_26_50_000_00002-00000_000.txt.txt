Within this month there is the necessity of circulat-

campaigns, executing the
writing and distributing platf

0n reﬂecting that some

Why should It be that in this
country where we are blessed
with the most liberal govern
ment in the world we have to be
content with the attitude that
only those who can not obtain
better positions go to work for
the federal government?

Is it compensscion that makes
people shun the government
servirol I think not. in almost
all the starting and middle
positions salaries compare very
favorably with those in private
firms.

Surely it can not be lack of
Security. After all in times of
crisis the government of this
country would be ihe very last
thing to collapse.

The issues handled by the
great ndrninisiracivo agencies in
Washington are big enough to
satisfy the most ambitious peo-
ple. Location is hardly a. prob-
lem. Positions are available in
almost every large city in the
world.

service to his country in the

SCARLET AND BLACK
C of HP Initiates

Series to Inform,
Awaken Interest

This is the beginning of a
series of articles to be published
in the Scarlet and Black by the
Council of House Presidents con-
cerning its actions and policies
as a means of informing the
Student body so that they may
more intelligently assume re-
sponsibility.

It is their feeling that with the
privilege of student government‘
goes the obligation to accept thel
responsibility of carrying out
this system,

In order to intelligently ass
sumo this responsibility the stu-
dent body must be familiar with‘
the policies and actions of theirl
elected officers, The Council be
licves that in the past the lack
of interest and failure to accept
responsibility on the part of the
students has been due to a lack
of information. ,

The Council of House Fresh,
dents has been as much respon-l
sible for this situation as anyone=
concerned because of its failure!
to inform students of its work.

Included in these articles willl
be discussions of the policies of
the Council, which in additionl
to informative purposes, will
serve to clear up any misconcep»
[ions The regular business and
general disciplinary action mken
by the group will be reported.
The first of these articles will
appear in next week‘s Scarlet
and Black. It will concern the
dining room policy of the Coun-
cil.
