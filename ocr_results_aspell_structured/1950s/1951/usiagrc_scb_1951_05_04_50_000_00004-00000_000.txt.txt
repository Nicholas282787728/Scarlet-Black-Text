Cornell at Mount Vernon.

Grinnell was the scene of the
first home stand of thc track
team Wednesday when the Simp-
son men took the annual dual‘
meet 67 2/3 to 63 1/3. The cone
test was close all the way, with
the final event, the mile relay,‘
the deciding factor. In the 're-
lay, Grinnell crossed the finish
line in l2 seconds less than
Simpson, but was disqualifiedl
for cutting in on the first turn

too soon.
Three Firsts

Burd turned in the top per-
formance of the evening by tak-
ing iirst in the loo-yard dash,
the ZZO-yal‘d dash, and the 220
low hurdles. Ellis pulled down
the number one spots in the dis-
cus and shot put. Taylor took,
first in the 440syard dash, with
Gage taking second; but in the
half mile, Gage came through
with the first while Taylor was
second. Football quarterback
George Whitehill walked off
with a tie for first in the high
jump and a second in the jaws-
lin.

A basketball star by winter,
Gardiner Button proved hims
self to be versatile by placing
third in both the high jump and
the 220 low hurdles. Jim Phelps
and Alan Goldfarb brought in
seconds in the 120 high hurdles
