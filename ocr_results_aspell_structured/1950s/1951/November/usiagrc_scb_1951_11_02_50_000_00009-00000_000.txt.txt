| ”The Grinnell Players are
.handling the ticket sales as a
'service distribution." Goughnonr
said. "Under terms of our con-
‘tract with Coburn and with the
extremely low price on tickets.
,littlc or no money profit can Ber
cruc to the players We feel
‘that this is a wonderful oppor-
tunity to have this tremendous
artist and personality on cam-
pus, and we‘re glad to under
itake the job of ticket disti-ibue
ition."

j Coliurn, dean or the Ameri~
t can stage and screen, has been
i seen in every shade or comedy
and drama, both classic and
modern, on the stage, screen.
radio, and television ior the
past six decades.

Coburn's current appearance is
lnot the first time he has graced
the concert-lecture platform. His
interest in the perpetuation of
the theater and the development
of talent has olten caused him
to offer arguments in defense
of the art and the need for recs
cgnition by universities and coir
legcs.

He followed American tradi-
tion by beginning at the bottom
of the ladder and climbing until
he became a star. At 13 he was
a program boy in the old Savan-
nah theater at Savannah, Ga,
and at the age of 17 was maria»
gcr or the theater.

It seems to me that those of

to become sensitive to a greater

lresponsibilities which each of us
have to preserve these institu<
