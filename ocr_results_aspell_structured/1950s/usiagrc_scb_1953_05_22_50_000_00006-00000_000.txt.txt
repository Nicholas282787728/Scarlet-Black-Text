YEARS AHEAD

1. THE QUALITY CONTRAST between Chesterfield and other leading cigarettes is

a revealing story. Recent chemical analyses give an index of good quality for the

country’s six leading cigarette brands.

The index of good quality fable—a ratio of high sugar to low nicotine—

shows Chesierh'eld qualify highest

. . . 15% higher than its nearest competitor and Chesterfield quality 31% higher than
the average of the ﬁve other leading brands. '

2. First to Give You Premium
Quality in Regular and
King—size . . . much milder
with an extraordinarily good
taste—and for your pocketbook,
Chesterfield is today’s best
cigarette buy.

3. A Report Never Before
Made About a Cigarette.

For well over a year a medical
specialist has been giving a
group of Chesterfield smokers
regular examinations every
two months. He reports . . .
no adverse effects to noxe,
throat and sinuses from
smoking Cbestetfield.
