To the Editor:

it has come to my attention
that certain incongruitics exist
in the present organization and
administrative duties of the
Council of blouse Presidents. Be-
cause of some injustices to stu~
dents with whom i associate and
to myself, I have taken the lib-
erty of expressing my views
concerning the inadequate na
ture of the Com? with what I
hope to be constructive prev
posals for the reorganization of
same; and at this time i hope
that you will inquire into these
matters in the same light ol
constructive criticism which coin-
pels me to write this letter.

if but one of these proposals
is accepted, then i believe we
shall be heading toward a more
liberal community of thought
and action.
Froposcd:

i. That the average of a secret
ballot deterinine'the amount of
ﬁne imposed not to exceed the
stated maximum.

2, That the exact charge
and reason ior the amount of
ﬁne levied be issued to the
onender before appeal.

3. That receipts be given the
offender after ﬁne payment and
statements of all moneys allo-
cated by the CoiliP be publislr
ed in the 3&8.

4. That lines for first offenses
be suspended at least 50 per
cent, the suspended portion to
be added to the total ﬁne of
the second offense.

5. That there be a higher ap-
peal board consisting of the
dean oi men, CoiHP president
and president of the offender’s
hall.

6. That the president irom
the oﬁender’s hall act as at-
torney if requested by the of-
‘iender in appeal cases. —

7. That more provisions
made to work oft ﬁnes.

8. That because of thc auton»
omous tl'i»functioning oi the
Com? (policemen, judges and
jurists)

(a) House president shall re

main “policemen"

(b) The council will submit
only recommendations (sec
proposalaf—fl) to the
President of the CoiHP
who shall have full aus
thority in all action taken
and may remain deaf to
the council’s recommenda
tions except in ﬁne deter-
mination.

9. That a graduated point
scale (distinct oi tine impns
sitions) he organized with, ior
example: 15 points ior various
offenses means social proba—
tion: 25, probation from school
etc. In this way the offender
will ﬁnd a more objective
meaning in the seriousness of
his oifenses.

To the Editor:

The new storage policy has
been thoroughly explained and
lustiticd on several grounds.
We can see that it will be
easier to secure and maintain
the property stored by students
if it is kept in one place. But
there remains the problem of
transportation, especially for the
girls who live, as we do, a block
lrom Moors,

It is no problcm for a husky
follow to carry several boxes
of books, a bookcase and a
large chair to the specified
place, but the spectacle oi a
120spound girl lugging 240
pounds of books is a sad but
common occurrence on south
campus.

Wc do not dispute that the
centralized system will be more
efficient, but we suggest that
some provision be made ior
manpower to be available on
south campus when the time
comes to store for the summer.
The knowledge that we will not
have to carrv our things clown
the last flight of stairs into
Mears basement or the dubious
availability of a couple of cus—
todians does not solve the oral)»
lem completelv. Can something
be done so that storage tickets
could be issued in the dorms
and the items carried to Mears,
if necessary with service
charges?
