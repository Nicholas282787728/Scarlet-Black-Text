Faculty Considers Academic Changes
In Various Department Requirements

A number of changes in the College’s policies, programs
and academic regulations have been approved by or proposed

to the faculty.

At the next regular meeting of the faculty, the Aca-
demic Standing committee will ask for approval of the fol-
lowing changes in academic regulations. These changes
have lieen incorporated in the Current edition of tile Student
Handbook hilt must have faculty ratification

1. Comprehensive Examinations.

The committee recommends
(a) the elimination of the third
sentence in the first paragraph
and the substitution of the tale
lowing:

“In the semester that they
take their comprehensive exams
inations, seniors may be excused
by the instructor from the
final examination in any course
in which the current grade is c
or above. seniors win be ex-
pected to take the final examin~
ation in any course in which the
current grade is below C”,

(b) the elimination of the
iirst sentence in paragraph two
reading: “A senior may request
from his instructor a final ex—
amination in any course."

2. Changes in the minimum
cumulative grade point aver—
age below which a student
will ordinarily be placed on
probation.

In the 1957-53 edition of the
Student Handbook these minie
mums were stated as follows:

First: Second
Semester Semester
First year
students
Second year
students
Third year
students
Fourth year

students 2.00 2.00
”After Carefully reviewing the
records of students who ended
the year in serious academic
difficulties it was apparent that
being placed on probation is
a device that stimulates some
students to greater efforts and
that it would have benerited
several students, if they had
been placed on probation after
the iirst semester. Some iresh-
man students, for example, who
barely made the 1.50 minimum
and were not placed on proba-
tion, obviously slackencd their
efforts in the second semester
on the assumption that they
were not in academic jeopardy.

"The committee is therefore
recommending to the faculty
the approval of the following

, minimum grade point average
below which a student is placed
on probation:"

sisted of ”a panic button to
push, a knee bender, and a tiny
dumbell for elderly mcn."

All was not run, however,
and the students were expect—
cd to learn the names or the
majority or the plants and to
study the ecology (composi—
tion and nature) of the fur-
ests. Each student undertook
an individual project, and they
are now completing their long
reports.

Judy remembers a “little
quiz" which Russell decided to
give thc group on the material
they had collected and used
thus tar in their trip. ”On the
test we didn't even have to look
closely at the plants, we knew
them so well. Dr. Russell Claim-
ed we had all the trees and
plants marked. We even told
him where the plants were that
he had missed."

This trip was the second such
venture by the biology depart-
ment (last year, Kenneth Chrise
tiansen took a group of students
to Arizona), and Russell com-
mcnts emphatically that it was
a “complete success in every
way},
