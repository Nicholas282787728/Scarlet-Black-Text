Stepping Stones?

South campus becomes an increasingly unpleasant place
to live as spring vacation draws nearer. For some strange
reason, animosities and petty jealcllsies come out in full
force as tlle women prepare for another year of self—gov~
emment.

It all starts with Student Council elections as the girls
become involved ill the campaign. Factions spring up in the
halls and everyone suspects that a major consideration in
each woman’s mind is . . . “What can I get out of support-
ing so-and-so?” With AWS board elections things get even
more tense. Each nominee is treated as a candidate Her
three year “drive" to the top is evaluated and if it looks
like she’s been out “kissing babies” a big black mark goes

down by her name.
Now, underclasswomen are being scrutinized on the

same basis. With each application and each appointment
someone raises an eyebrow and observes tllat the new
appointee has risen another notch in the political hierarchy,

Unfortunately, many of the accusations are true. There
are Women who apply and push toward the glittering AWS
goal. There are people who will give anything and every-
thing for an office. But at the same time, it must be re—
membered that there are others who apply out of interest in
what they can do for the job, not ill what the job can do
for them.

The scrutinizers tend to forget these service motiva-
tions, however, and ascribe to each and every application

the “campaign" motive. This is often not only fallaciolls,
it is gn'ossly unjust, unfair and unrealistic.

Many of our most vital and talerited leaders are defeat—
ed by their own interests. Those interests, when fulfilled,
leave the possessor open to accusations of climbing up the
political staircase,

Let’s not ruin the leaders we have by accusing them
of ambitions they may not have. And at the same time, for
those who are campaigning, ask anyone on the outgoing
AWSB—dt really isn’t worth breaking either your neck or
cutting someone else's.

The "women” of south campus olten accuse the men
of north campus of being immature because they occas-
ionally engage in water fights

Wednesday night Main hall resembled Niagara Falls.
Water flowed down the stairwell from third floor into the
first ﬂoor foyer, into the Little Theater and out onto front
porch.

The third floor firerescape door on the west side of
the building also looked lilie it was ill great need of the
Little Dutch Boy’s famous tllunlb. ,

Are these the “women” that call the men of north
campus immature?

Sticks

Stones

By Paul HESS

The movie version of “Peyton
Place” ended its rather prc-
tractod run last night, and, to

I attended, it must have been
viewed by the entire town and
college populace. A good num-
ber of those who saw it had no
doubt read the book, and want
ed to see just what Hollywood
had done with it.

What Hollywood did do with
it is worth a word or two.

The book was trash: vile,
undiluted trash, bordering on
the pornographic, and cam
loguing every term or dept-av»
ity imaginable. Rape, inccsl,
murder, suicidc and abortion
were described in revolting
detail, and, even worse, the
wholc thing was concocted of
a muddy, cliche-ridden prose
that would make an English
instructor's dcsh crawl.

However, there being a vast

market for trash in America.
“Peyton Place" sold madly, and
our movie makers naturally as-
sumed that they ought to share
in the loot. So they made
movie of it.

That the movie script did not
follow the text or the book is
beside the point. There are
numerous reasons for not graphe
ically portraying in Cinemascope
some of the happy events listed
above. Incest may occur in our
place in our scheme of things,
bul it does not belong on the
screen. Nor do the others, bar-
ring murder, to which We are
pretty much accustomed.

Furthermore, it docs not
have to have n high school
principal who assaults the
heroine’s mother, nor a hemr
ine who ends up sleeping with
her literary agent.

All this the movie makers
rectiﬁed. Pcrvcrsion was kept to
a minimum, and was only im-
plied in the script; most of the
poisonous garbage was cut.
What remained might have
made a halfwayrentertaining
movie. It did ncl.

The movic makers. in their
haste to expurgate lhe more
tawdry passages, typically blunr

derod all the way to the other

extreme.

Thus the moneyed draft
dodger became a war hero;
the town trump rercmerg’ed
as Jane Austen; the principal
was no longer rapist but kind—
ly upholder-of—idenls; and the
rabid Congregational minister,
poor tellow, was eliminated
altogether.

A certain amount ci grime
was smudgcd on the script, but
the Cub Scouts, the kid who
ate too much at the picnic, and
the barbershop quartet # in
short, everything that is Hun-
nert Percent American A were

Eva—liﬁth Lectures On Myth
As Affecting Society Today

By Bill Kell
John Kenneth Galbraith, Harvard University economics pro»
fessol'. this week delivered a series of five lectures, in which he
examined what he called “The Nature of Social Myth." The last
lecture in this series, financed by a grant from the Merrill foun-

dation, was given this morning.

_ _ In his first talk, Galbraith discussed the influence of the “test
ludge by the turnout the mm of acceptability, rather than truth or reality," in treating social

phenomena. He snld, “Continu-
ing adherence to overriding door
trine is the iiist of lhc soul‘c s
of social mylh, and perhaps lha
most general.”

“Clearly, scientiﬁc truth in
our society is rather didcrcnc
(ram mcrc lruch." Much of
the concern over the Oppen-
heimer case was related to
the feeling that, as a scientist,
Oppenheimer had a particu-
lar right and obligation lo
state chc truth, Galbraith said.
“No one would urgc that a
Secretary of State is subject
to such compelling standards.”
He said people have yet to
iully assert their faith in the
rationalistic approach to social
decisions. “Many of our gencl»
alizations are or an essentially
benign sort: their greatest eﬁort
is in preserving marl {mm the
unnatural and painful exercise
of his intelligence as new prob-
lems arise. How much better tol
do the wrong thing than to have
in think."

Galbraith concluded: “We can
retain faith in such doctrine
only by closing our eyes to ex-
ceptions and change."

in his second lcct Gal-
braith d is c u s s r d “inﬂuences
which almost inevitably twist
our interpretations or destroy
our perspective or economic and
social history."

He said: “While it has often
been said that each genera-

lion writes, or rewrites, its
own history, in the case oi
truly great event: the earliest
interpretations are likely in go
unrevised. And since the very
first interpretation will almost
certainly reﬂect nn incomplete
and primitive understanding
oi the event, lhcrc is reason
to expect that understanding
will be more or less perman-
cnuy accommodated to myth."
Galbraith classed the Civil
War and the Great Depression
as the twn event: (if the last

ccnlury with lruly profound hi
torical impact on zhc United
States.

Galbraith re-examined sev-
eral stereotypes of history. He
declared that the National Re-
covery Act of the depression
had no great. depth of eco-
nomic signiﬁcance, contrary to
popular impression. The speak-
cr attached much more im-
portance to the relatively un-
heralded legislation which prov
vidcd for insurance on bank
deposits.

“Where events of this type
nrc concerned, the moving ﬁnger
writes. Some or what it writes

.are fairy tales, but all is in in-

delible ink.”

In his third lecture Galbraith
considered the way in which
we are captivated by the inﬁur
