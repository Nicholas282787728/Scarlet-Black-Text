War, The Tiger

The literal translation of the
original French title is “The
Trojan War Shall Not Happen."
The tiger is war, prowling at
the gates of a contented city-
state, Troy, The play suggests
that if this first “world war”
could have been prevented, per-

tory of the world
could have been prevented.

Fate has made Greece and
Tnoy the powers of the world
and has given them comple-
mentary strengths and weak-
nesses. where one is strong,
the other is weak. The con.
ﬂicting ideals of the two com-ls
tries create a situation in
which a great struggle to the
death seems inevitable. By
leading these two powers into
war, Fate seems to be pre—
paring a future or catastrophe.
Hector and Ulysses, in an
effort to find peace, attempt
to defeat Fate by using reason.
But Fate is not to be side
tracked by mere men and she
turns loose one of her crue‘lest
tricks, human stupidity.
Demolos, the poet laureate
of Troy and leader or the Sen-
ate, believes war has advantages
because of its poetic beauty:
King Priam feels that war will
turn cowards into heroes. Thus
Troy is dragged into the war,
which ends only with its coinv
plete defeat.

Production

Ned Donahue (speech),
tor or, the production,
“While the basic storv
grim one, it is given a
treatment in that the
makes fun of stupidity
exposing it."

All of the notion takes
place in the battlements at
Troy. Since most or the scen-
ery consists of platforms of
dirierent levels, most or the
color must come from the cos-
tumes. Donahoe added, “We
have purchased rive new spot—
lights to use because at the
importance oi lighting in
bringing out the color in the
play." .

Others in the cast are Lowell
Powell, the mathematician; Da—
vid Durrand, Busiris; Mike
Burr, Troiius: Steve Diamond,
Topman; Robert Nachman,
Olpides; Hal Jaffe, Ajax; Floyd
Hughes, the messenger; Sue
Hass, Polyxcne and Judy Clyde,
the laundress.
