The game was a contest he»

that ran the second half acn

both unable to collect either
or the extra point attempts
artor the ’l‘D’s.

The Siwash from Knox col-
lected II'D's in both the first and
second quarters. A 37—yard Mike
Morin-Larry Kiest pass moved
the ball down to the 2-yard line
and Morin crashed over for
the tally. A pass attempt for the
two—point conversion was un-
successful.

the jock

by Joe
The most discouraging and
encouraging athletic situation
on campus this year is the
freshmen turnout for fall sports.

The paradox results from
there being only a little more
than twenty men out for cross-
country and football; but of
these twenty—odd men over half
of them show definite varsity
potential. If the caliber remains
as high for the winter sports
and interest improves, the Pio-
neer’s graduation losses this year
will not be as disheartening as
expected.

west Conference standings.

The Scots have defeated Cora
nell and st. Olaf, and have lost
to Carleton, Knox and Cos.
Passing has been the key to their
victories. Against St. Olaf, Mon-
mouth connected for 22l yards,
and against Cornell, the Scots’
passing netted Well over 200
yards. Quarterback Jae Sufficld
is the man who provides the
punch in Monmouth’s air at...
tack. Suffleld, only a sophomore,
has passed the ball consistently
against all opponents.

Last Saturday against Coe,
the Scots took to the air 33
times, which was more than
half their total plays. This
gives an indication or how
heavily Monmouth hopes ride
on a strong passing attempt.
Grinnell’s main task will he to
minimize these gains, a task
which may prove difficult for
the pioneers, Many times this
season the Pioneer pas de-
fcnsc has been spotty, and
Grinnell has not as yct met as
strong a passing attack as
Monmouth‘sl

Monmouth operates from the
“T” formation and incorporates
into this a variety of flanker
sets and inside and outside belly
se‘ries. Their defensive line is the
largest in the conference, aver-
aging 230 pounds per man from
end to end.

The Pioneers recoivcd no
new injuries in the Knox con-
tost, except for several minor
bumps and bruises. This
means that the Pioneers will
be at near full strength tor the
Scots. Monmouth, too, is ex-
pected to be at top potential.

Coach Bob Peterson empha~
sized the importance of pass de-
fense against Monmouth. ”If our
pass defense can stop them, then
there probably will he good
news for Grinnell fans.” How-
ever, Peterson commented that
this was a big “if.”

Pioneers Run Past
Knox In Sixth Win \
0f Season, 16-46

By Tom Super
The Grinncll cross country
team did its part in making
the Homecoming weekend a suc-
cess hy routing Knox, 16-46.

The Pioneers, victorious in
their sixth straight. dull meet,
were led by team captain
Chuck Yoak who covered the
three-mile amuse in 15:26—-
one second off the course rec-
0rd. The next three Pioneer
harriers, Louis Sachs, on his-
ser and Grant Fairbanks, all
ﬁnished in,mut of Knox‘s
ﬁrst man.

Again showing their clown-the-
line strength, the Grinnellians
took eight of the ﬁrst ten places.
Fred Boughey ﬁnished sixth,
Hap Luttcr seventh, Chris King
eighth, and Tom Super tenth.

Tomorrow the Pioneers meet

Monmouth on the Scots’ home
grounds. Monmouth isn’t con-
sldered to be too tough this
year. To indicate their plight,
they were defeated earlier this
fhll by the Knox squad that
G r in n e ll overwhelmed last
weekend.

Next Saturday, Nov. 8, the
barriers tangle with St. Olaf and
especially with their individual
star, Dave Wee. It should be a
good contest.
