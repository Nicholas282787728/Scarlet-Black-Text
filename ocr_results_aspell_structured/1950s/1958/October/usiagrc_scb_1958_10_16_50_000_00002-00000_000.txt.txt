"PURSUIT AND FORMULATION"

Norman Springer (English) approached the
stillecl with El slutoiiient of his boll , as to
wnat qualities constilutctiic inake— p o the in-
tellectual. According to him, “An intellelual is
no’ one who simply rcads books, lacing truly ins
tcriectual means thc continual pursuit and forms
ulation of what one knows and tccls as wcil as
, at one ought to know and ought to feel." or

rse this is not limited to the difficult and
in poi-taut pursuit and formulation or ideas about
ideas. but it includes the wholc cndlcss task of
ci-aluating every a. cot oi one's existence.

"I an. iinuly 1g," ho stated, “that this
means the awareness oi one’s own limitations
onil an cvcriasting and viWirous examination
or who one is and what other neoplc are and
how those are related to each other, and, pen
imp. most important, hon they arc rclatcd to
the mmeiise, rich and electrifying complc. ty
which the past represents."

III. is Springer's contention that our campus
does have its share of intellectuals, “but with
the average [we course load, each course der
mending huge blocks of time. the exciting and
tough iiitcllcctual pursuit. which ought to be the
very center of this school, is drastically limited.

CONSEQUENCES OF VALUES

"For inc an intellectual is an independent and
cooperative person, an individual with a mature
:cliaracter, who bases his actions on vcridical
knowledge and who understands what conser
qucuccs his values lcad to," said Leo Baranski
(psycllolog) ).

Baranslti felt that a mayor flaw in our intelr
icctual sphere today is the fact that “too many
students arc inter , ed in education only to find

He iurlhcr assorted that much or the blame
ioi- ii decline in the intellectual curiosity can
be bid at tho icct 0t iaculty memhe. and
this is due to thc iact that we are living ii an
era oi cultural transition. “A ncnr iunaticai
emphasis on grades and mi liliiiost abnormal
intorcst in thc social liic or students arc inani—
icslations or a iaoiilty at a low level of
iiiornlc."

When asked about ihc position oi thc intcr
lectunl on this Campus, he stated that “the most
prevalent complaint oi this caliber of students is
that the campus is too conloi-ming."

UNlTY AND DEVOTION

Madge Phillips (women's physical education)
termed ‘iin intellectual "one who has some unity
or some philosophy which holds his ideas to—
gether and not one who goes around picki u and
choosing those activities that suit his (is re of
the moment. He must possess curiosity, doubt
and a genuine scholarly interest "

She stnterl that “there are muliy intellectuals
on this campus, although many of them remniii
dinriiiant. There are also some intellectuals
who don’t care if others know it or hair"

She advocates carciul planning or coursc
loads and scheduling to allow time for the pun
stilt of one’s intellectual Curio tics.

Beth Noble (Spanish) a sci-ts that an intel-
lectuni is ”one who is devoted to ideals and

‘nciplcs and will d by them. He tries to
thliilk through his decisions inirly and lnlDZIl"

ial y,"

She added that "a true intellectual would fit
into the Gi‘iniicll campus because Grinncll is a
school based on the highest principles and ideals.
It is always dililcult. however, to find all the
time one would like to devote to the full pursuit
3f intellectual goals."

”WHEN TO WHICH"

An intellectual, as Viewed by John Nelson
(education) is "one who can meet life's problems
adequately. Intellectualism is more than the ac-
cumulation oi knowlcdga, The basic problcm or
the intellectual is to use his knowledge in such

a way that ho knows better ‘when to which.

Nelson feels that there is “an adequate op~
uortunltv for ZI student to delve into intellectual
problems which confront him. There seems to be
a great deal of flexibilitv within the courses
offered here so that a student has ample oopoi»
tuliiLV to investigate a specific part of the course
which especially. interests him or challongcs

him." l
"UNSELF-CONSCIOUS"

Alan Jones (history) stated that his View of

an intcllcctuai was moonc you c i live with
and anioy bccauso nt' the discriminating and un—
sail conscious way he handles himself with re-
spect to ideas and values." Although Jones felt
that there were intcllcctuals on Grinnoll's cam—
pus hc stated that “they do not sell thc gcncral
tone 0[ the campus and are in a real minority."

cludod that ntcllectual curiosity is importantﬂ
it is tlic limiting iactor of many bright sudens."

STUDENT OPINION DIVIDED

Student opinion on the nature of the iiitellec»
tual was divided on certain points, One opinion
was that "the intellectual sti‘ es book-learning
more than the actual experiences of life” (Doc
Davenport), and another stated that “intellectuals
learn tor learning’s sake” (Ann Crauer),

More generally, the opinions offered stress-
ed “apylicntion 01' what a person knows to till:
situlitions confronting him" (Canol Flora) and
“the ability or a person to reason, using his
basic iiwzu'cness, Lind to communicate his

thoughts to others" (Jim Jacobson).

”Ali intellectual is a person educated in many
fields so that, he can base decisions on several
different disciplines" (Merritt McCall).

There are intellectuals on this campus, ac—
cording to those people polled. However, .estir
mates‘ as to the number of them ranged from
“many" t "Very few" and included qualiﬁcations
such as, There are many intellectuals in the
making on this campus. but they are not yet
true Intcllcctuzils" (Jacobsolilv

It was the Consensus that campus life at
Grinnell does not adversely affect the intellec-
tual. One idea expressed was that “many iii-
tellectuals, by their own choice, sit off by
themselves" (Bill Christina“). “Many intellec~
trials don’t fit into college or group life unless
there is an aggregation oi them present”

(Gordie Hunt).
Others stressed the importance of the intellec—
tual's own personality, stating that he would fit
in if he wanted to,

“YOU DON'T FIRE UP"

Do Grinnell students have the time to pin-—
siic their intcllcctual ilriosity7 "You don't'fiie
up tor iiilcllectualism ' (Liane Ellison). “Intel
cctualism does not depend on the amount oi
time one has to spend attempting to be an inc
clicctual" (Linda Fintoni.
