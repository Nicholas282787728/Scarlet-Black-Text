This is the time of the . lr wheli the almighty grader
pl-ill't loon out of all reasonable proportion. Students cal—
cl2la‘ie their individllal semester averages, their cumulatives.
tlizil hall averages. Sonic eye their eligibility for Phi Bete,
hilitii's. Mortar Board or Fria , some \l'orr about going
tlr academic probation.

it is true that the stlldellt preoccupation with grades is
llrllealtliy but, at the same tilne, it must be reeog'ii ed that
inli'ts determine everything from the student" linancial
Si:l.latillii (in terms of scllolnlsllips), his eligibllit ' for sports
oi c lnplls oliiees and his flituie lob opportunities to h
' ihility for gladuate school. As long as grade averages
are of this significance, should they not be administered
ar'l computed in tlle most precise mallner possible?

To tlle contrary, in the Registrar’s ofl'ice, plu. and
lll'lillses are "rounded off” until the rough edges are hewn
al ay and each illdividual’s do can be poured into tlle

id mold of L1, 3, 2, l, grading.

Would it not he l'ar lnore accurate and honest to put
illn'ell's glading on a complete point system? A ade of
for e lmple, would indicate a C plus. To be sure, tllel'c
'xuld he an end to the era of the “foili'pointcrs”. There
would also be all end, ill all probability to the marginal
aCidemic probationers and to the people who fall a few
po’nts short of their scholarship requirements.

As a matter of incentjvg such a system would (lis-
‘colrage a large amount of “slolighing”. When a student
g‘t- into an exam knowing that, no matter what he does,
he’ll conic ollt \\ith a C, he will not put a great degree
at eliort into his preparation. On the other hand, if he
knows that every fluctuation in his pel'l’ormaiice will be
re ected ill his grade, he will show more diligence in prep-
ar tion. While grades should eat serve as the prime incen~
tire to good scholarship, they should not be allowed to
function as a deterrent either, as they do iii the present,

'id system.

The president of the Ameri-

that we are “essential to our

cation". We're glad someone
else said it, for we would he
immodest if We said it.
This authority goes on to s 3'
that, ”Running a college

thankless eiToi't. But without
the college store, the profes-
r and the student would be
