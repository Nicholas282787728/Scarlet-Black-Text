SCARLET AND BLACK

By Paul llass

On the bulletin board in the
entryway of the dormitory is a
pathetic little note from the
housekeeping department:

“Only small scatter rugs are

to be allowed

No tape on walls

Hang ﬁllings on bulletin

boards hung with wire
and hooks from mould-
ing. —Mrs. Main"

And scrawlcd across this pro-
clamstion is “Get serious. hon-
ey!”

Late last spring, after i had
drawn a room, I approached a
housekeeping official and asked
lf he would not see to it that.
my room was painted over the
summer; 1 was told that more
than 50 rooms would he paints
ed (presumably those in the
Worst condition), and that I
would count on a new decor
this fall. '

But September hrought no
joy to me: the walls were
still a vomimus green- and-
yellow; the pipes in the ceil-
ing were still ﬂaking on rusty
paint, and crumbling plaster
‘ still littered the cornersi My
ﬁrst inclination was to send a
nasty note to housekeeping,
but, having dealt with that
august body the spring before,
I decided In take mufflers into
] my own hands .

Mrs. Main, a transformation
has been wrought No longer
does my room resemble a third
rate lockup: two walls are
Shasta White (I quote from the
palnt cans), and two are. Desert

Beigc. No longer do the pipes

Much more could have been
done, I hasten to admit; there
are still cracks and gaps in
the plaster, and the ceiling
seemed too much for an ama-
teur painter to tackle. But
other touches more than com-
pensate for these lacks; on the
walls hang a liandiul of Utril-
Ios, a Gaugin, a Van Gogh or
two; a rather artful shelf is
screwed into one wall, and an
