Grinne/I Gridders P/a

Pioneers Se’ell Win i
To End 7th Place
Tie' With St. Olaf

by Dale Furnish

Tomorrow the Grinnell toot-
ball tcani goes out to Ward ficld
in' quest oi its second victory of
the season. The Pioneers will he
opposed by the quick and tal~
ented gridiron forces of St.
Olai college, a team which last
week-end fought undcieated Coe
on even tcrins for tour quar-
tei-s, only to lose 16714 by the
margin cl extra points.

Though the Olcs'aro possess
sors oi a somewhat melliocrc
season‘s rccord of two wins and
tour losses, they are described
by Griiin‘cll's coach Peterson
as having both a strong pass-
ing (tack and a quick-striking
running-oiiense that is a threat
irom anywhere on tho field.

vital cogs in this scoring ma-
chine of the men from North
field include hacks Denny Rune,
Bob Algo and Ron Ree. Rune
particularly stands out. A ten~
second sprinter for the hundred
yard dash. he had a hand in -
both touchdowns against Coe.
Quarterback Nate Schoitz and
his favorite passing target, end
Bill Robinson, may also hc men
to watch.

If any -tra incentive is need-
cd to bring a total effort from
the St. Olaf squad for this game,
there is that too. Grinnell upset
them last year, 6-0, tor the iirst
time in a si -ganic rivalry and
added insult to injury by being
the first Midwest conference
team to hold the Oles scoreless ,
since that team entered the "
league. The total series now ,
stands 1r4rl in favor of St. Olaf.

The principal Grinncll strat-
egy, as outlined by Peterson,
must he to “contain" the po—
tent Ole oiiense; that is, to
hold them to three and iour
yards on every play and
never allow the opposition to
unleash any long gaining cf-
forts, The opponents are ac-
knowledged to be faster than
the Pioneers, ‘but must give
away weight at almost every
position and could conceivably
be worn down if they are
iorced lo grind out their yard-
age.

Gl‘inncll will be hampered this.
