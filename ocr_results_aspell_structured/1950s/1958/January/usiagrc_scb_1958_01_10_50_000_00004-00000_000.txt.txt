Bowen Book Given
Foreign Publicaiion

A book by President Howard
R. Bowen has been published in
Brazil in a Portuguese transla—
tion. “Social Responsibilities of
the Businessman" is the title of
the book, the Portuguese title
being “Responsabilidades Socials
do Homem de Negocios." The
translator is Octavio Alves
Valho.

The book was originally pub<
ilshed in 1953 by Harper and
Brothers, New York.

“Comments from our students
who are now in medical school
who have taken this cause
have been most favorable,"
states Oelkle.

Since considerable under-
graduate student research is
carried on both during the
school year through independ-
em projects and studios for
honors and during the Sum-
mer months under special
grunts, “putting organic chem-
istry in the sophomore year
allows the student to begin re-
Search in this field as early S
the summer between the soph-
omore and junior years in-
stead of having to wait mﬁl
a year later as was um

i under our lormer program,"
i he adds.

This experiment in try—
ing other than 1116 CORN/811‘
tional organization of courses is

,not purported to he the ideal
l solution to the problem. “We do
feel. however. that for us its
i advantages far outweigh its dis-
advantages," continues Oelke.
