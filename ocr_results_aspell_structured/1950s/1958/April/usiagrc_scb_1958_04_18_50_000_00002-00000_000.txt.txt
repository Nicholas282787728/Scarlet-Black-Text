‘To Free The Mind OfTear'

Academic Freedom week (April ZOVZG) will the observed on
Campuses throughout the country. Wednesday’s coffee hour panel
Will discuss the implications of the dismissal of college professors
following their use of the 5th amendment.

The signiﬁcance of academic freedom, however, lies a great
deal deeper than the isolated dismissal of a. handful of profes»
sors throughout the country. it is a core problem in the entire
idealistic Structure of education.

Louis M. Hacker, clean of the sullool of General Studies at
Columbia University, writes: “Citizenship requires virtue, usefula
ness and boldness; to free the mind of both prejudice and fear are
the demands we impose upon educators, at the same time that they
exercise their functions of scholars and scientists."

in today’s conformist society, the colleges and universities are
among the few places where new ideas can be studied and dis—
cussed without fear ofreprisal by those who fear new ideas. Iln
many cases, the professor with a mind which searches for utopias
is the same man who pleads the 5th amendment because of past
associations with groups whose motives hc belicvcd innocent at the
time of that association. with the summary dismissal of professors
pleading the 5th amendment or confessing past associations, the
last sanctuary of original thought is challenged.

In any society, progress depends upon the ability to adjust
to and analyze new concepts. if our culture reluscs to consider

radical steps it will lose its vitality.

Those seeking to oust the “free-thinking" professors purport
to protect the immature student mind. To be sure, the students on
today’s campuses are voung. We are experimenting and exploring
the prcccpts which will shape our life beliefs. Our youth, however,
does not insure acceptance of each and every new idea advanced by
each and every respected faculty member. '

College dorms are among the world’s greatest strongholds of
conservatism. We challengc caoh idea and seek to establish or
defeat its claims to validity. We do not swallow blindly. We
need to seek and challenge to test our growing minds.

, such needs of ours must be answered by our educational in-
stitutions._ We can never steel our minds against fallacious con-
cepts until we have been exposed to them and have challenged
them. The American G.I.’s who staycd behind in Korea are shock-
ing examples of this need for'exposure to all channels and levels
of philosophical and political belief. Had those men been allowed
to formulate their own convictions as to die rightncss or wrong.

prey to the Communist brainwashing.

Spring has come at last . . .
the good season.

The grass is lush at Westﬁeld,
the bluebills and tcal dot Rock
Creek Lake in profusion. There
is a gentle plopping of golf
balls in the pond at the first
hole north of town. Buildings

planting and tending new trccs
on central campus, and thcrc
are yards and yards of drains
pipe behind Blair. All is wcll.

And, i think, all was well
with the disturbance at the
quadrangle Tuesday night. it
was it good show, a better
show than in years past, and
a show that provided thrilty
entertainment for most of
those—men and women—who
took part in if.

it would hardly be fair to the
administration or to the students
whose duty it is to maintain law
and order to encourage such
goings~on. This goes without
saying. And l have no intention
of doing so.

But 1 do think that a few
words of praise are due the
Grinnellian for the way he
comported himself Tuesday
night, The mob that converged
on south campus was a large
one, and for perhaps an hour
it was fairly well organized.
It was bent on entering the
hallowed doors, and it was,
for the most part, thwarted

But the mob never got ugly;
there was very little destruc-
tion: 1 saw one or two win-
dows cracked by the general
shoving, and there were a cou—

to compare with the carnage
that has accompanied such large
scale uprisings at other schools.

There will be penalties, of
course. Those hardy souls who

throwing ”T-mebs” will no
doubt pay stiff ﬁnes. Still and
all, it will be a small price to
pay for so much glorious revels

Something ought to be saidi
for the law»enfol'cers, too. The
CofHP met its ﬁrst crisis intel—
ligently and judiciously, tak-
ing direct action only where
it was necessary to prevent
mass break—ins. The dean of

to the crowd handily and ab-
stained from interference.

And the AWS Board, never
losing its sense of humor, stout-
ly defended the sanctity and
virtue of Grinnell womanhood.
Thcre was no impassioned rc-
enactment of Horatius at the

indiscriminate name—taking. It
was a calm, sensible job of po-
lice work . . . a good job.
