By Jerry Gray

Last fall‘s touch football sear
son, which was quite a hit of
trouble loi- everyone concerned
because oi the Asian ﬂu epi-
demic, was brought up again in
the past Week's lM board inect—
ing.

As everyone remembers, it
was necessary to have a
doublevelinlindtion tournament
in order to decide upon a
champion. Final placings were
to he decided upon liy the
number or games won. my
gardless of bracket It turned
out that this was a very poor
method in the eyes of the ma—
jority oi the preschthhoard

By this method, Cowles, Smith
and South Younker, who all
won the second highest number
of games, finished in a tie for
second place. The difficulty was
that in the course of play,
South defeated Cowles, was
thereupon defeated by Smith,
who, by virtue of this victory,
gained the right to play Gates
for the championship. After ex—
amination of the tournament as
a whole, the 1M hoard decided
to change the method of deter-
mining places to a system by
which Smith was given second
place, South third, and Cowles
fourth.

1 am still not sure whether
the action of the IM board
is justiﬁed. It seems to me
that it a tournament in ath-
letics is set up to be scored
in a certain manner. that
tournament should retain the
prescribed scoring method un-
less changed hy the origina-
tor oi the tournament.

I don’t think that a change
from match play to medal play
in a golf tournament after com-l
pletion of the tournament would
meet with much approval by
the _contestants. However, such
is lite in the Grinnell democ‘l
racy. i

The Pioneer nctincn emerged
from last week's competition
with an easy win in a triangu—
lar against Corncll and Mon-
mouth and at the short end of
a 5.,- scorecard against Iowa
State. The loss to lowa State
was the lust of the season for
the Grinnciiians.

Saturday the Pioneers play—

Monmouth teams on the home

abled each player to play one
