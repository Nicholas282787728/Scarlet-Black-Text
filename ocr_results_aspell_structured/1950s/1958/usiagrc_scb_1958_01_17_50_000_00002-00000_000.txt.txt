In the current ﬂurry of dissatisfaction over KGRW,
numerous suggestions have been advanced that the Com-
mittee on Student Publications investigate tile situation. The
committee, however, operates upon the basic premise that
the publications personnel are reliable and this trust is
maintained until evidence to the contrary is introduced.

In the case of KG such evidence as can be advanced
to support a contrary view has been introduced—not to the
committee but to the council. Until these objections are
brought before the committee it will not act.

Council recommended last spring that KG be placed
under committee supervision. It has since however, neglect-

Selective European Secondary Schools
Seen Superior lo American System

By Noel

Did you ever realize that the work you do in the first
two years of an American liberal arts college is completed
by British and European students in their last two years of

high school”!

Are you aware that whereas the first two years of
work in a liberal arts college is really an extension of high

reward, and to the three editors
I have written for: they have

ed to give the committee the power, information, or moti— dent (or sort of a student), welcomed my ideas and my

Vation needed to allow that body to function in a truly
supervisory capacity.

If an investigation of KG is to be precipitated by evi«
dence and/or complaints submitted in council, that investi-
gation can only be conducted by council unless and until
it formally refers such evidence to the body empowered to
take action. ,

Neither KG nor the student body in general will profit
from an investigation by a body which is not empowered
to take constructive action.

To be sure, council, as a result of its study, can with-
hold financial support from the station, thus removing it
from existence (and, at the same time, washing its own
financial investments ill the station down the drain when
they are finally on the verge of maturation.) Council has
not, however, the power (or the ability) to guide KGRW
toward becoming a succesful “voice of Grinnell college."
This function can and will be performed only by the com»
mittee and then only if the council ceases to block the pre-
sentation of complaints to the duly constituted power.

Would it not be feasible in the future to reconcile effi-
ciency of registration with students’ tendency to change
courses, schedules, (or even majors) by reducing the period
between second semester tire-registration and final regis—
tration to two months rather than eight'.7

In this Way, students would be far better equipped
to make definite schedule plans. There would be less courses
dropped and less added. Registration would not as often be

(really school training, in European and British colleges it con-

stitutes a concentrated program

of “reading" a certain specialty,
more typical of the latter two
years of American colleges or
the first year of graduate
school?

Most American college stu-
dents imagine foreign colleges
to be just a variation of the
average pattern of American
coed colleges and universities.
This could not be further from
the truth.

In the first place, entrants
to schools under the British
and European system: are us-
ually a year older than their
American Conn-ens and are
more highly sele What
this means in effect is that
work in the secondary schools
is harder and more intensi-
ﬁed —— more languagts, more
mathematics, more history,
more physics and chemistry.
The process of eliminaﬂon of
college aspirants begilu in
those schools, Whereas in the
U. S. they do get into college,
but then either make the
grade, flunk out, or are nursed
along by the school for various
reasons.

As a result of the earlier
intensiﬁed work in secondary
schools and the final matricula—
tion examinations, which are
really college entrance exams,
a much smaller znd more select
number of students are admitted
to colleges than is the case in
the U. s. This. of course, en-
ables the college to allow its
students greater freedom and
individual responsibility for
scholarly production, since their
outlook is generally more akin
to the undergraduate senior or
graduate student in the u. s.

In American colleges, as a

able to succeed in couoge,
the administration has to in-
sist on compulsory attendance
to classes, more supervision or
students, tests and quizzes to
check students progross. Stu-
dents in British and European
colleges are forced to develop
responsibility in high school
in order to exist amid the stiff
competition and even stiffer

exams.

College life in these schools
has little of the community
