SCARLET AND BLACK

November 7, I958

 

A lack of communication . . .

. or the desire for such is, we believe, one of Grill-
nell's greatest l'aults. Between tlle three campus groupsi
students, 'iaculty and administratioll~the need for social
intercourse is apparent.

Strident Council meetings proceed week after week with
faculty members or administrators oilly occasionally pres
ent iii any number.

The faculty‘s actions are made known only through
a short story that might appear ill the Scarlet and Black.

Administrative actions sometimes do not even appear
in the paper until three or four days after, through the
everpresent grape—vine, they have been mis-explicdtcd,
misunderstood, and misjudged. / I

The Scarlet and Black can be a tool for the alleviation
of the situation by becoming some sort of clearing-house
for all the news each of the three groups has made.

But we doubt if this is really the answer. The problem
alises, we believe, because the three groups recognize them~
selves as just thatﬁthree groups. There has to be the reali-
zation and appreciation of the fact that these three groups
operate for the benefit of one whole—the Grinncll College
community.

When and if this is dolle ill the optimum, that is when
the three groups make a conscious effort to work with each
other for the good of the community, the Scarlet and Black
can become more than a clearing-house. Through its edi-
torial pages it could make opinions of all three groups
known based on the understanding between the three
groups, an understanding that would come from the coin-
munication now lacking:

“Something New Every Day"

Sticks and Stones

By Paul Bliss
The time has Come, I think, to clarify my position rcgardlng

the housekeeping department.

You will perhaps recall that a controversy of 501 s began some

Weeks ago when I lamented the failure at those wol

lcs to paint

lily room over the summer (as they had promised to do), and 01
[he-I’Qsll‘ictlons they were attempting to put on room decoration
(this is, the prohibition of thumb tacks and Scotch tape). Admitted-
ly, I created the issue, and I wrote the piece in hopes that they

would be publicly Embarrassed.
hai h

My words may have been too

and, in any case, the housekeeping department has since

mo I led its rules; the evil was put right, and the issue was, to my

mind, dead,

Last week I attacked the
housekeeping department for
a different—and inr better——
reason. I lclt lhnt it was “he
[air to ask north campus
maids to clean the men’s
lounges at 7 am. Sunday, hnd

that failure in pay them extra
lor this work was doubly un-
inir, i didn’t write the piece
in h sophomoric pet, nor did i
expose an injustice because I
hnd nothing better to write
nbout; I was grieved that the
noon could not clean up their
own messes and rather thought
it would help if the mnirls'
plight were known. 1 merely
set down the lacls. coupled
with a triﬂing nmnunt oi sur—
casm. less vituperntive thnn
clriding,

But what a reaction! I was
collared by a housekeeping ad-
ministrator e. her this week
and given h thnruuch going
over, the gist of which was
“What have you eat against
me?” i was told. further, that
the 3&3 ought not to print
such sassy stuff. that the maids
simply love coming on Sunday
lllornimzs. and that (in ossouccl
I ought to bc ashamed of my
self.

A deions s in ordrr While
I don’t par lcularlv mind being
labeled a naughty boy nor being
made to understand that my
opinions dilier- from those of my
elders, i do resent the ll‘nplicar
tion that I last week distorted
the facts and personally assault-
ed members of the llousekecpr
his department. Thi- plccr was
not Written borer-o l,consultod
with n number- of maids (all of
whom were vehemently opposed
to working on Sunday). and it
in no way constituted a personal
[attack on anybody.

l As a matter or that, it was
l so factual and so impersonal
that it was downright boring.
But it was not the luck oi
grace in my writing that was
called into question; ll was
the content and (apparently)
the tone, and the fact that
j such nastiness was allowed lo
r appear in our collcgc weekly.
l

without too much
trouble, Write a column that
would praise Grinncll to the
heavens each work, I could tell
ayou how smart we are. and how

women’s hours and Union coffee.
I prcior, however, to point out
what i think are the several
{lies in tho Grinnoll ointment,
lo hold stupidity up to ridicule,
to help stamp out folly.

I am well aware that I often
iarl, that i sometimes make my-
self ridiculous. But when I do,
my nnmr is on the piece, and
thc oiicndcd parties are wel-
come to employ the columns of
this paper in their defense.
Freedom of expression is no
more denied the housekeeping
department than it ought to be
denied inc . . .

That the housekeeping and
building administrators have
twice Come in lor n shellackr
ing is, l assure you, more an
evidence or their vulnerability
tlrnn or my malice. As proot
ol this I odor you the case of
the Cowlcs hall door which,
more than n month ago, rec
ceived grave injuries at the
hands on male student. Samar
one had chained the door han-
dles together, und, in the
struggle to open the doors,
one of them was wrcnrhcd on
its hinges. The c_ of HP wns
subsequentlv billed lor a
new door, but, in the menu»
time. the old door (mortally
stricken, it was claimed) was
set back on its hinges. The
new door ﬁnally arrived, and
runs put in place this Wednes-
day.

Damage had been done. and
someone had to pay, The c oi

HP oﬂ‘ercd to pay part oi um
bill, and hood the doorrwrenche‘r
a moderate sum. it hardly seemr
ed reasonable, however, to ask
that thov pay in full for n new
door, when the old one was not
only door-colored in vhluo but
still usable! Trying to prove, to
Buildings and Grounds that the

31d door was more than a bit
careworn, the C of HP altered

to show them an ancient crack
which had been painted over;
this odor was rcbuﬂcd with
“How arc we to know that you
didn‘t just rub shoe polish into
a new cr-uckiLa question that
smacks not only of resentment
and distrust. but oi unbridled
idiocy.

The door. I am happy to re-
porl, is yet unpaidrtor. But the
housekeeping department merchs
cs on, muncrrng bitterly under
its br-cath, undaunted by all this
unjust criticism . . .
