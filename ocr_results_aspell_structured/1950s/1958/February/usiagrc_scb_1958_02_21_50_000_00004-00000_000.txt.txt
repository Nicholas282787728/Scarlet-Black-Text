inan.

Plad‘orms

Referring to his candidacy,
Jones has stated that “the poslr
tion of Student Council pre —
dent is not a glamorous one. To
make the council tunction as
an effective unit or student cov-
ernment requires a great deal
of time and thorough organizer
tion on the part or the presi-
dent. In the past, Grinncll's
studen council has not (ah
the in iative expected of it
handling student affairs. AS a
candidate for SC presidency, l
have a real interest in seeing
the council function more ence-
tively and feel that my expe~
rience in various positions or
leadership qualify me for its
responsibilities.“

Issues which Reed will con.
sider in his plattorm include
the 4~3 plan advanced place—
ment credit, “the grade rat
nice," the tutorial system and
studentrfnculty relations. Said
need, “Some oi the commit—
tees on which students are
presently serving are dealing
with areas that should be
emphasized by the main coun-
cil, while the council spends
too much time with petty ad—
ministratire tunctions
The council, like any organi—
zation, should follow an agen—
da . . . The present frame oi
government is adequate for
effective student paﬂicipav
tioni”

Gerry Thompson favors the
estaousnment ol' allrSiudent
Committees on such matters as
the curriculum and the library,
and the coordination oi these
separate groups will their cor-
responding taculty committees.
He thinks the tutorial system
deserves study.

Thompson replied to a stu-
dent Council request at thc
Feb. 12 meeting that Thomp—
son, now so treasurer, either
attend all meetings or send
a .conipctent representative.
Thompson said that while it
was “a very had thing" for
him to miss last week's hudget
meeting, his part in the bud-
get was “practically nothing"
Thompson said that he has “a
deep interest" in Student
Council and has hceii actiVe in
it for two years.

Caryl Wagner said her arm
is “basically, making Student
Council what it is supposed to
be: representative of Campus"
she hopCs to “place more
emphasis on representatives and
the agenda oi meetings."

Bob Wciizman said. “I'm not
releasing my platform to the
[311554) s a surprise platform!"
