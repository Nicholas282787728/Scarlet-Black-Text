Christian and the Unity We
Seeks” Some oi the primary
points in his talk there are

outler believes in the ’e 'tr
once of “a common Chri iaii
history," and that ”the more
clearly we perceive it the more
positively, we are prepaied to
push beyond c ng separae
tions as neither ﬁnal nor ir~
rcconcilahle" He named the
Bible as "the true bond ot unity
amonc Christians at any given
time."

Believing that the Christian
sense oi history needs-to be
made more explicit. Outler de-
iined this history as “the sum
oi all the past events acces—
sible to mans memory and
judgment which has served to
re present to him the apostolic
witness to Jesus Christ. The
discovery oi our total Chris-
tian past is the means oi iull-
er in ation into the whole
Christian iamily

Outiel‘ believes that the Chris-
tian Sense of histmy amounts
to “ones awareness of his own
share in the total history oi the
whole Christian colnnlunily—
