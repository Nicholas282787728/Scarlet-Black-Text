Duke Annouces
Younlzer Rooms

Still Available

”There are still ten rooms in
Younker Hall—first come, first
served," said dean of men, G.
Lester Duke on Wednesday.
“Any student living in town
who wants a room in Younker
should see me as soon as pos-
sible.” Dean Duke pointed out
that the rooms will be ready
for occupancy by the beginning
of next week. They are located
at the north end of the first
floor. Another bit of news which
might encourage oifrcampus
students to move into Grinnell's
newest structure is the fact that
there will be doors on the
roomsbytheend of next week.

“Of course," Dean Duke said,
“We have no intention of forc-
ing anyone to move into Youn-
ker. But the rooms are there for
anyone living in town who
wants them, and the college
policy has always been to try
to fill the dormitories as much
as possible."

As Younker Hall will probab—
ly not be entirely ready for oc-
cupancy this September, Youn»
ker will not be a hall unto itself
this semester. Any student mov-
ing to Younker will retain his
former hall affiliation.

“lncidenally,” Dean Duke
said, “there are four or five
rooms open in the Student Un-
ion. They, too, will be avail—
able."

Laundry Will Go Thru!

Moincs postmistress, notified the

ing of George Jeck interviewing
Woody Herman. This is sched-
uled tentatively for next Wed.
nesday night.

A special quiz show, scheduled
to get under way in March is to
be called “Who Bat?" and will
consist of a quiz board of two
members from each hall guessing
a well~known personality, Parti-
cipants will compete for prizes
from local merchants.

in addition to planning new
programs and acquiring talented
entertainers, KGRW has invest-
ed over eighty dollars in new re-

Top Jobs Copped
By South Campus

A full slate of candidates
heard the decision by the
board of publication Tuesday
that made Diane Powell and
Charmayne Wilke, Loose
juniors, special assistant edi-
tors of the Scarlet and
Black.

They, with Marilyn Reeling,
Loose junior, and Elizabeth
Buzzard, James junior. who will
serve as special assistant edi—
tors of the Cyclone and Arena
respectively, will undergo a
ltraining period to gro‘om them
for the full editorship next {all

At the meeting which kept
the board and 16 candidates
in suspense for tworand-a-
half hours, Jim Hartley, Lan-
gan freshman, was named as
business manager of the Scar-
let and Black. Mary Fisher,
Cleveland junior, and Foster
Rinefar’t, Clark freshman, will
manage finances and circula-
tion of the Cyclone and Arena.

The division of Work propos-
ed by the Scarlet and Black
co-editors in their letter of ap-
plication would make the edi-
torial policy of the paper the
concern of both, but the make-
up, that is the appearance of
the paper, and the content as
roughly separate concerns. They
said their policy would include
the retention of the editorial
board and the policy of restrict~
ing news to campus affairs.

During the business meeting
of the board preceding the con—
sideration of individual candi-
dates, a motion was introduced
by Mr. E. r. Andrews in view
of the tightening advertising
lsituation brought about by the
threatened war. The motion,
which carried without a dis»
senting vote, was to decrease
the basic salaries for next year
to 65% of this year's salary,
leaving the loophole that edi-
tors and business managers
would be allowed to receive any
amount over that up to that of
present salaries if it is possible
for the publication to earn it.

Notice of Change

The change in the salary set—
up was explained to the candi-
dates before their letters of ap-
plication were read to the board
to give them a chance to with-
draw or revise, but none did.

This will be the second year
the Scarlet and Black has fol<
lower! the policy of training
an editor candidate for a full
semester. The Cyclone and
Arena will be following this
suggestion, which developed
from a campus leaders’ meet-
ing, for the iii-st time.

of the 16 candidates, there
were five men. This was
thought to be a reflection of the
uncertainty of their return next
fall. Foster Rinefort. in accept»
ing the Arena business manag-
ership, said that be checked
ahead of time with his draft
board. it said unless there is a
war or much greater national
emergency, his number would
not come up before fall.
