November l5, [957

By John Smith
Oh sweet Victory! The Fio—
neei‘s won their first home foot-
ball game in two years as they
trounced Monmouth 29-0.

The win was a team effort.
Every squad member saw ac—
tion in the game. it would be
hard to single out any indi-
vidual performances but cer-
minly few afternoons in the
long history of Ward field
have been more filled with
.the inspired football and sav—
age tackling which Coach Pet-
crson’s crew demonstrated
last Saturday. A m o n g the
many highlights was Jack
Shaffer’s resounding open field
tackle which prompted one of
Monmouth’s seven fumbles. On
another occasion Bob Weitz-
man powered into the Man»
mouth backfield and slanuned
a halfback for a ten—yard loss.
Dick Yaki poured in upon the
Scots’ quarterback and then
swiped the ball from him as
he was attempting to pass,
These were some of the bril—
liant and more obvious plays
in a thrilling afternoon of
football.

Passing was the only means
of offensive success which Mon»
mouth could muster. Grinnell’s
rushing defense was superb hold-
ing the Scots to a mere 25 yards
on running plays. Only one
Monmouth excursion succeeded
in getting inside the Pioneers’
20 yard line.

Grinnell gained its first
scoring opportunity after Bruce

Wilkerson recovered 3 Mon»

Olaf Could Give

grinnellians Tie For MWC Fourth

By Robb
Knowing that a will 0v

Madgett
er St. Olaf will give them a

tie for fourth position in the conference the Gl‘inliell Pio-

lleel-s left this morning for

Noi‘thfield with tremendous

hope and strong determination.

Gl'innell has failed to hell

i; the Oles since the Minnesota

school entered the conference in 1952. The closest Gl'l‘nnell

has come to doing so was in 135

1343, That was the year that
St. Olaf was picked as a prob
ablc player m one of the minor
bowls on New Year’s Day.

So far this season St. Olaf
has lost to Ripon, Carleton and
Coe, A loss tomorrow at the
hands of Grinncll will give
them a 44 season and a tie
with the Pioneers for fourth
place. A victory tomorrow
would not only place Grinnell
in the top division, but would
give them a 372 2 season record,
the best in 15 years.

Grinncll wiu again play the
role of underdog, but will
make up for it with detexm»
motion and the chance {or
the first win of the short
series. “St. Olaf will not be a
pushover by any means," says
Coach Peterson, “but we do
have a chance to catch them
napping." Coach Peterson also
feels that the squad is in
nezll'»top condition, mentally
and physically. The only
serious injuries suffered in
the Monmouth victory are
Roger Smith, who suffered a
torn cartilage in his chest
and a sprained ankle, and Bob
Carothers, who obtained a
broken nose. Smith may be
used for limited action, but
Carothers will not make the
trip because of complications

Much of the burden of to-
morrow's game will be placed
on John Copeland, the Grinnell
little big-gun. Last Saturday
against Monmouth John set a
new Pioneer record in total
offense with 908 yards. This is
John's first year on the varsity,
and he has proved that size is
not the most important asset on
the gridiron, He has netted
509 yards rushing and 399 pass—
ing in 193 plays. To this record
John said, “Without the tough
line and fine blocking in the
backfield i could never have
obtained the record. 1 can’t say
that there is anything more re
warding to a back than to head
around end with four to five
white shirts in front of me.
They have really been a great
bunch to work with."

This game will wind up the
1957 season for Grinnell. It

also will be the last time that

Cope Places 20lh
ln Nation's Offense

After leading the Gl'innell
offense against Monmouth
last Saturday, 'Jolm Cope-
land broke into the national
small college standings as
20th among the individual
leaders in total offense in
the weekly standings com»
piled by the National Colleg—
late Athletic Bureau.

In seven games Copeland
has gained 509 yards rush»
ing and 399 yards passing
for a total offense of 908
yards in 198 plays. The bur—
eau, a subsidiary of tlte
NCAA, compiles cumulative
statistics weekly.

What conceivable rationaliza—
tion might be offered to justify
the ridiculous display of school
spirit exhibited at Ward field
last Saturday? What excuse is
there for the 700 students (of
950) who couldn’t see their way
to our last home football game?
None.

Little has been Said all yea:
regarding Grinnell‘s acute
caSt: of apathy because it was
hoped that we might accept
our responsibility to be some-
thing more than lethargic by-
standers in the wake of School
activities. It‘s obvious, once
again, that such an aspiration
is futile.

Evidently, the only things
capable of arousing this stu-
dent body are pesudo—intellectual
discussions, boys running around
in bras and skirts, and ‘skip’
,days. (Bitter, you ask? Yesll
Why not? 7 Last Saturday was
a perfect day for football. The
game was the season’s home
finale. Adams, Kurth, Ohline,
Orsborn, Pattschull and Shaf<
ter played their last contests on
Ward field climaxing a long,
hard season.) Don't we owe
them, and the other 24 varsity
members two hours of our time?
I think so.

What must be done to sﬁm~
ulate a little meaningful
spirit? Do our teams have to
win every game they play? In
a roundup of all sports last
season Grinnell finished sec-
ond in the Midwest conference
_a regular occurrence. This
year’s grid squad has a better
than average record.

You’ve had your ‘skip’ day.
You’ve had a chance to play
superman and cops and robbers
with the freshmen. The winter
sports season (basketball, swim-
ming and wrestling) is prec-

tically upon us. Might we spend
a little time in fostering school
spirit7‘!
