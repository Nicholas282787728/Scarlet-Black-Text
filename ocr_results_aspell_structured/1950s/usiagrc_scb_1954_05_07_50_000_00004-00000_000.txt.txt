McCandless' Facfs & Figures
Show 40% Remain Four Years

by Chuck Stegmcir

Approximately 40% of the men and women entering Grin-
nell as freshmen Will continue for four years and graduate. This

is but one of the conclusions the

t can be drawn from a study of

the available facts and figures on postwar attrition, i. e. the loss

of students, at Grinnell.
An analysis of the records

of the class of 1951, conducted

by Eethana McCandless, registrar, gave these figures which hold

true generally for the classes gra

Out of 384 freshmen entering
the college in the {all of 1947.
138, or 35.9% graduated in June
1951. 17 or 4.4% graduated
early, and four or 1% left but

_xetu.rned and graduated as
Amem'bers of later classes. Thus
la total of 159 members of the
freshman class or 41.3% re-
ceived their degree from Grin-
nell. 225 or 58.7% left the col-
lege sometime during the four
years.

What reasons ‘do students
give for leaving? where do
they go if they transfer? and
when do must of them leave?
Examination of the reoords
from last yen reveals the
answers to those questions.
The reason that women fre-
quently give for leaving is so-
cial dimtisfwﬂon.

Academic failure, marriage,
and economic reasons rank next
in that order. Men give eco»
nomic factors and calls to mill-

tary service as their primary
reasons for dropping out of the
college. Academic failure is
also a major cause.

Of. the students who do not
graduate from the college ap»
proximately two-thirds leave
voluntarily and onerthird leave
involuntarily either because at
grades or economic factors.

The postwar rate of attri-
tion among men had always
been smaller than that among
women previous to last fall
when 135 men did not return.
This was 27.27% of the 495 men
enrolled in September 1952, and
15.72% of the total college en-
rollment of 856. 85 women did
not continue, a group forming
23.54% of the 400 women on
the campus and 9.9% of- the
college enrollment at that time.
The total withdrawal of 220
men and women was 25.69% of
the enrollment.

‘ The maiority of women
students who do not continue
at Grinnell request their tran-
scripts in order to attend
another college or university,
This is shown by the statistics
for last year when 55 of the
35 women leaving did 50. Less
than half of the men request-
ed theirs however-only 59 out
of the 135 that left.

Among those individuals res
questing that their transcripts
be sent to another school, most
intended to go to universities
rather than colleges and fre-
quently they had selected their
state university, according to
Miss McCandless.

Most students who leave Grin-
nell before graduating drop out
at the end of their freshman
year, although there is con-
siderable attrition in the sopho»
more class. Out 01' 300 fresh-
man entering in the fall of
l1952, 100 or one third did not
return. This number was 45.5%
of the 220 withdrawals for the
year. There were 67 men and
as women in the group.

as sophomores or 40.3% at
their class ’of 211 had drop-
ped out by the fall of 1953.
These 43 men and 42 Women
formed 38.6% of the total
group that did not return.

A total of 32 juniors and 3
seniors made up the rest of the
withdrawals. The juniors com.
prised 14.5% and the seniors
only 1.4% Of the total number.
The 23 junior men and 9 jun-
ior women formed 14.5% of the
179 in their class, and the two
senior men and one senior was
man who left were merely 1.9%
of their class of 155.

Comparative attrition figures
for Grinnel] and other liberal
arts colleges are not available.
Such figures will become avails

able in the near future, how-,

ever, when a study of attrition
now being conducted by the
U. s, Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare on a
national basis is completed.
