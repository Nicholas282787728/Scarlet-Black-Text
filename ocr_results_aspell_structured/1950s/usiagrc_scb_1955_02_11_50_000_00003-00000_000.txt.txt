Coach Bob Petersen’s wrest-
ing team takes on Wartburg
omorrow at Waverly in an at—
empt to win for the iirst time
gainst the Knights.

Wartburg has beaten the Pio-
eers for the past three years
nd boasts another fine team
his yeari The Knights have a
one and one record, beating Coe
-nd losing to South Dakota
tate, which is exactly how the
ioneers fared against the same
.pponents.

Knight coach Norm Johansen
as only an average lineup in
he lower weight divisions but
ram 157 pounds up, Wartburg
. extremely strong.

Peterson said that Arnie
.l-andt, Knight 177smunder, is
“one oi the finest wrestlers in
his weight in the country." Paul
Reylets at 167-pounds was also
cited as very good.

The Grinnell lineup is linear
tain. The outcome oi the meet
seems dependent on how the
Pioneers do in the lower weight
brackets.

Next week, Men’s varsity bas-
ketball completes about three
fourths of its seasonrand the
sport opens officially for the
women’s intiamnrals. Compar-
ing last week’s varsity games to
the hall practices — it looks as
though the girls should have
profited more from watching
the plays, not the players or
the west side of the gym at
previous games.

New lntramural Chairmen,
who were elected in last Mann
day’s housemeetings, have al-
ready had a taste of “getting
the kids out to fight" and in
general boosting hall spirit.

Coe's leading scorers have

Tommy Thomsen’s starting line
up will probably be Etienne and

and captain Bud Crawl at guard.
Defensive ace Larry Koch, who
missed practice because of a bad
knee, appears all right again

and should be in shape for the
Kohawks.

With eight returning letter-
men, Illinois Tech reportedly
has a good squad this year, com-
parable to last year’s which
won 17 games While losing six
and which topped Grinnell by
a 70-68 score. The Techawlu’
big guns are co—captains Ed
Thullen and Bill Christiansen,
forwards.
