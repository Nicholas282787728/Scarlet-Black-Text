‘ Salutations. . .

Grinnell college has been ill existence for 116 years7
growing, expanding, (leveloping‘ito the point where we are
now one of the leading educational institutions in the
country. We “go it alone," unsponsored by any government
control or any one power. Ollr power rests ill alumni all
over the country, individuals and groups, reminiscing about
their college days.

Twice a, year we welcome the graduates of former
years to the Grinnell campus, once at Homecoming iii the
fall, and again at Commencement Lime iii the spring, Be-
cause the school changes so pidly from year to year
these alumni do not always feel r ght at home immediately,
but we, with v'ely little effort, can help them feel they
are still a part of Grinnell.

Ill getting together with recent graduates this wee -
cnd, let‘s try not to ignore the rest of the alumni, but 5f t
to know some of thenl as well a our old fliends. These
fomler students have. been out of school a ten years and
probably have many good ideas and suggestions for chang-
ing and further developing Grillncll in ways we haven’t
thought of.

Here's hoping he call respond, “Oh, we’ve got that
since yoll left!" . . . but on the other hand the alums may
come up \lith . me reallv \lolkable suggestions for making
Grinnell better than ever. '

From the President . . . .

A succcsfnl Homecoming depends upon three thing
A large number of enthusiastic alumni and friends _vi
ing on the campus, a fine program of events including a
victory by the football team, and good weather. There
are so nlally parts of this formula that are beyond the
control of the administration of the college. We have done
our best to encourage alumni to come back to the campus
ill large number . We are happy to welcome those of you
invitation. We
have planned a good program of activities. The team is
ill fine spirits, and we may have a Victory. The weather
is completely beyond our control. However, there is some.k
thing so vital about Grinnell associations and experiences
that it takes more than the possibility of cold and rain to
dampen the spirit of Grinnell men and women.

You will be on campus iii the middle of the first se-
mester. A fine freshman class has quickly oriented itself
to the demands of a new social environment. They have
become true Grinnellians iii spirit and in attitude very
quickly. The student administration of studellt college af-
fairs has demonstrated a degree of ability and responsibility
which has been most encouraging to those of us who have
constantly kept faith with this tradition of delegated re—
sponsibility to students for students. it is the considered
judgment of experienced members of the faculty that the
conditions and requirements wllicll we have met this year
have strengthened ollr intellectual resources and our ed-'
ucational productivity. We believe that the college year is
fully living up to ollr hopes for it. It will be pleasant to
hear your comments and useful to have your criticisms.
It is the desire of all of us \lho serve this institution to
exercise wisdom. understanding and critical judgment. As
alumlli, proud of the traditions of the college; we welcome
your suggestions aild criticisms as we greet you on your
return to this campus. ,

Homecoming can be a simply magnificient occasion.
Sometimes it is marred by excesses on the part of alumni
which have little or no relation to the requirements of a
happy weekend on our campus. I ask of all alunlni that
the) respect the rules and regulations of this college. By
doing so yell will make the task of the college a much
simpler one for the remainder of the year.

Have a great, good time, and help us to make this
Homecoming a splendid experience for you, for the stu-
dents, for the faculty and for the administration.
