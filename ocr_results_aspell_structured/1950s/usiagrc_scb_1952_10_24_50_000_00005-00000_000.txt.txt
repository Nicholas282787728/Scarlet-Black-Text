While munching a between
meal snack down at Joe’s, I
started wondering what to say
in this week’s column.

Last Saturday’s Ottawa game
is a thing of the past, yet how
could one help but write about
it. It was fabulaus! The\Pio-
neer rally was probably the
most courageous seen in these
parts in many years The stands
were excited and hoarse, rare
for a Grinnell crowd. They
Couldn’t believe what they saw.

it was the biggest Scarlet and
Black display of offense since
they beat Ripon 50-25 in 194%
Yet there have been many other
fantastic scores in this school‘s
history. For example: 1394,
Grinnell, 54rSimpson, o 1895,
Grinnell, 54-Feoria, lsoo,
Grinnell, 75-Simpson, o. 1907,

greater total score for both
teams than the Ottawa contest
That was way back in 1892,
when the Scarlet and Black
edged by the Des Moines YMCA,
13270. Those close games are

 

great to watch.

Chuck Dunham played what
was undoubtedly the best Pic»
neer individual game of all,
time (although there are bound
to be some old timers who will
disagree with this). He was all
over the field, .scoring five
times. If he doesn‘t make all}

robbery!

,Yet it was Bob Norton who
actually fired the Pioneer off~
ense. He completed 9 of 13
passes while brilliantly mixing
in running plays. Bob engineers
ed six of the seven Grinnell
touchdowns. Here was living
proof of the old football axiom
that an adequate air attack will
make a good ground game go,
wild. ;

probably have seen Marv Clein.
Almost every day Marv is

lwcrking out in the gym with a

basketball or on Ward Field
practicing his hand»ofis or ﬂip--
ping passes.

Marv, “the best defensive
halfback on the squad last
year," according to Coach John
Pfitsch. was assigned to fill the
toughest job on the gridiron

,this fail—that of quarterback,

He worked all summer in
Chicago parks to improve the
ball handling and passing
which is beginning to pay off
as the season progresses,
“Min-V’s play calling and de-
ception are constantly getting
better." Pfitsch remarked. “If
he can find his receivers he‘ll
be a tough manr"

Sports come naturally to him,
for Marv has been competing
ever since he was a small tyke
in grammar school.

His ability shone during his
prep years on Chicago’s north
side. in his junior year he
played guard on the Senn high
school team which tookthe City
Basketball tournament. In his
last yea? Marv was elected Cap-
tain of the quintet. He was
primarily noted for his finger»
tip ball control which

football field. He was also cen—
terfielder for the school’s base-
ball club in his last two years.

Though he is proficient in
many sports, Marv’s favorite is

the backs to get. more rest.

If Grinnell can't beat Corr
nell, they probably won’t_be
able to beat anyone. Still, there
is no reason for overconfidence
in the Pioneer quarters, in spite
of the newly»found offensive
power. The Rams will be all
fired up up for their Home.

let skating. He has‘ won medals
in Silver Skates competition
lheld in Chicago.

Enlisting in the army after
he graduated from high
school, Marv was sent to Kor-
ea. There he remained for
over a year, playing ball in
his spare time.

A little over a year after he
was discharged, the army res
called him from Grinnell where
he had completed one semester
‘of school. This time Marv wasi
sent to Camp McCoy in Wis»
consin where he was put on the'
athletic coaching staff. He ens
ioyed his second hitch with the
army very much, especially as
he helped coach the camp base~
ball team to a seasonal record
of 47 wins, against 2 defeats.

With a streak of luck, Marv:
returned to the campus for the
fall term having missed onlyi
one semester of school. He wenti
out for the football squad and‘
started the first game at defen—
sive left halfback where he re ,
maincd or the rest of the sear
son.

Hoping to continue the
physical education line, Marvi
aspires to a coaching position or,
to work with polio patients as
a physical therapist.

This season the short, eager, ‘
good—natured athlete has been
doing an admirable job at
quarterback and in addition
has been playing defense in
his old position a major part
of every game.

“The toughest breaks of this
season," Marv remarked, “Have
:becn our lack of depth and in
,‘iuries to key men." ‘

in spite of ”the breaks" thel
Pioneers showed last week
against Ottawa that they can
,hang on and even come back in
ithe grueling second half. Per-
ihaps they can do more than
come back this weekendiand
beat Cornell at Mt. Vernon. if.
they do, you can be sure Marvi
Clein will deserve a big part
of the credit.
