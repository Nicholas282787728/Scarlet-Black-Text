Grinnell’s‘ New Idealism

President Bowen’s W esday morning chapel speech
was a combination of c ism, appeal, and information.
He criticised the ”modern college generation” for its lack
of ideals and values. He appealed for a renewal and
strengthening of the Grinnell tradition of idealism. And he
tried, at the same tilne, to give tlle students an account of
physical improvements and plans. l

,The speech was received by many students as a mass
of high-flown, idealistic preaching, hard to reconcile with
the practical problems of developing the college and the
practical problems of modern lifeithe split-level home and
the station wagon in the garage.

But Dr. Bowen has tried, since he came to Grinnell,
to develop a synthesis between idealism and practicality.
Faced with the need to improve Grinnell materially and
spiritually, he has been able to reconcile two seemingly
opposite attitudes, and act upon them as he does his job.

‘ The speech is an indication of his success in applying
his personal ideals (and his personal practicality) to the
job of being Grinnell's president. The speech is more than
a “plea for idealism,” and much more than an indication
of Grinnell’s attention to practicality.

We hope that We can find the ”happy medium” as
Dr. Bowen has, and make it work for us. And we hope
that Grlnnell, as a. college, can help us to find it

The C of HP’s latest prep-
ping program is one oi a
long, long line of “prepping
philosophies," and represents
another try at a program ac-
ceptahle to everyone.
in practice, however, the pron
gram is carried out by each
hall, and some halls have a
frightful reputation for inter-
preting rules by taking advan-
tage of the loopholes.
Objections to swntting (hu-
miliates the prep, destroys his
self-respect, causes cancer, etc.)
and objections to “stunts" (hu-
miliates the prep, destroys his
self-respect, causes etc.)
have resulted in a “point sys-
tem” and a “study hall" that
go a long way to destroying
not only self-respect but initia-
tive, a feeling of VOLUNTARY
cooperation, and the right of
the individual to be good, bad,
or lndiirereni.

Is it reasonable that the
freshman, being of unsound
mind and having little or no
ability to know what is good
for himself, must be led, babied,
caioled, and pushed down a

Jericho

To the Editor:

it was a nice tree while it
lasted—that ﬂowering crab north
of the library steps.

1 don’t know who planted it
when. But there it was in the
spring, full of pinkrwhitc rosette
blossoms forltwo or three weeks,
the prettiest tree on the cams
pus.

But two things were against
it. One of these was that bar-
baric ritual called prepping
which required some men’s hall
prepmastcr to send his fresh-
man proteges swarming up the
tree to hang from its branches
like ovel'»ripe fruit or under-
privileged primates. Despite my
one~man campaign against it,
the practice went on year after
year with a net loss each time
of one or two branches.

The other thing against the
tree was that like some womr
en, it had its less beautiful
moments This summer it ape
peered to be only a scraggly
little brokenrdown wreck. It
Was then that the axe, saw and
crowbar m‘en descended, leaving
only a bare spot to remember
it by. l

The moral? That cx—preppers
and other sympathetic collegians
or ex»collegians contribute to
a conscience fund for the pur-
chase of a new tree of the same
species; and that in the future
Grinnell recruit only those stu-
dents Who do not know how to
climb trees.

house-councilrapproved path that
is meant to lead to academic,
social and athletic glory? This
is the philosophy of at least

lone hall on north campus. The

house council, wallowing in a
Jehovahcomplex, has disregard-
ed suchghings as the right of
the individual to raise his hand.

The refusal of hill! member
ship, it seems to me, is a to-‘
tally empty threat. strange as
in may seem, there are still
some people who refuse to
believe the old and peculiarly
American lie that one must
JOIN to be successful. Some
of the world‘s greatest men
have been quite horrible neu-
rones, misnnthropes, gn-it»
aloncrs and social rebels. And
somc of them have even been
happy at the same time.

rm not advocating the cultir
vatian of a neurosis “as the key
to success. But isn’t there, a
freshman somewhere who has
gotten over his initial wide-
cycd worship of npperclass wis»
dom, and who feels obligated
to op‘en his mouth?

To the Editor:

We would like to use the
3&B to express our appreciation
to everyone who contributed to
New Student Days. We feel
that Whatever success was
achieved can be directly attrib-
uted to the ﬁne cooperation
and hard work of the many in-
dividuals and organizations in-
volved.

We wish to thank the group
leaders for the great job they
did of introducing this year’s
freshmen to Grinnell. Many or—
ganizations a i s o contributed
more than their share to make
the program possible; particu-
larly the two “Y’s" and the
Buddies committee. We appre-
ciate the nssisiuncc we received
from the administration and
staff of the college and want
especially to thank the offices
of the deans, the foods depart-
ment, and the physical plant
staff.

The cooperation and depend-
ability of everyone concerned
has made our job much easier
and more enjoyable. Thank you.

Bill and VeAmn.

'To the Editor:

This letter is directed to all
students who want to see
KGRW on a permanent basis.
We feel that only by the stu-
denls’ Cooperation will this goal
he gained. It is our opl ion that
it is time to quit spending stu-
dent money on make-shift
equipment that must be replac—
ed every year. This year, as in
the past, the station is strug-
gling to get on the air before
school closes. However, we
would like this year to be the
last one in which this situation
occurs.

This year, because of our new
policy, we may not cover the
entire campus with our Signal.
We will not replace any equip-
ment unless we have thoroughly
tested the new apparatus, and
We know that it Will make a
lasting improvement in our
transmitting system. At present
our new transmitter is in the
testing stage. It is a ‘great im-
provement over our present
transmitters, which are no yard-
stick of quality. We feel that
more experimenting will be
beneﬁcial.

Since we at the‘station do not
have the time and the student
body does not have the excess
money to make the improve-
ments in one year, we must ask
the cooperation of your publica-
tion and of the student body.
We ﬁnd that this is the only
way we can give everybody the
kind of service he wants and
deserves.

Sincerely,
Robert F. Lucas
Station Manager
