Wrigh+ Discusses
Women's Posiﬁon

ln World Alfairs

“Every woman has the in
ﬂuence and opportunity to help
win world peace because it is
the women who' create public
opinion in the United States,"
Mrs, Quincy Wright, chairman
oi the Chicago council on\ For.
eign Relations, said Wednesday
night in Herrick chapel.

In her speech, a highlight of
women’s week, Mrs. Wright
discussed the power held by
women and what might be done
with this power if women
would see themselves in rela-
tion to the World in which they
live.

“The sound

world needs
health, education, and food
programs.” Mrs. Wright said.
“These are the things that wo~
men know how to accomplish.
They hold a key position."

Mrs. Wright cited examples
of United Nations work in
Haiti, Bolivia, and other for-
eign countries. She pointed out
the increasing political inde-
pendence of these countries and
their need to combat hunger,
disease, and illiteracy.

”You have a chance to use
what you have learned in psy—
chology, languages, recreation,
or any other courses you have
taken and to put your knowl—
edge to use," Mrs. Wright asvi
serted: “But you also have an
opportunity to work for world,
peace." i
A reception in Main drawing!

”It is our responsibility

sibly for the rest of the world,“
Robert Fischer, vice president
of the Iowa Republican Farm

his address in Herrick chapel.

Fischer spoke about the pres
ent agricultural problem and
the recommendations made by
the council for a workable, long
range farm program to an and
ience of college students and
farmers from the Grinneil area.

“The only hope of preserv»
ing freedom in our time is to
accept the responsibility and to
find a way, through democratic
processes, that will make our
economy and society function

with prosperity and freedom”

Fischer stated.
Wilbur c. Molison, state sen-
ator. also a member of the
council, introduced the speaker.
