the position of Asia and Afrir

Reading said, “as a sort of

should have taught that.

“There must be a new ques-
tion, and though the answers
to it will be as simple in
their humanistic terms ns the
answers in Europe were in-
thcu- materialistic terms, they
will be much harder to apply
by a people, the Western peo~
ple, who tor close to 100 years
have established policies oi in- :
ten-national behavior on the
assumption that the probation .,
of races is over and done and,
as w. E. is nubois pointed
out, ‘that the backward races
‘ﬂf today . . . are not worth
savings" ,

Redding emphasized that this‘
assumption must be abandoned
if the new huestion oI whatl
the people of the Atro~Astan‘
countries want is to be under:
stood and the new answer ape]i
plied, and it a “new and dan-,

Bedding criticized the at
tude and coverage that the w
tern press gave the conferencci
in Bandung in 1955, i‘The. dclc-'
gates to the conterencc at Ban-
dung were there because of a‘
conviction that the problem oi,
the 20th century is the. problem‘t
of the color line, as written by
W. E. B, Dubai: '54 years bo-
iore.” However, Rcrlding said,
“No Amei‘izan and no British
newspaper or any great conses
quence and coverage gave this
conviction (that the problem oft
the 20th century was one ofl‘
color) the overbearing weightl
ii: had in the deliberations at
Bandung. The American Chriss
tian Science Munimr did report
as follows: “The West. is exclud—
ed. Emphasis is on the colored
naﬁons oi the worlJ” Bum
according to Bedding, the “oh-l
vious fact" was that the emr‘
phasls was not on the Colored
nations but on the color prob--
1am in the. world “And it was;
this that made ‘tllc Asian-Afri~[
can conference the g: atesl -his-‘
Lorie event of our caniuryf”

Although the members Df’
the Bandung conrercnce were
agreed on this major convic—
tion, Reﬁlling said l at there ‘
were many “great and basic
dihorcnecs rcpresentcd among
the var us members." The 23
nations that sent official dele-
gates- represented tour orierr
tation blocs—neutralism, cont
munism, socialism, and demons
