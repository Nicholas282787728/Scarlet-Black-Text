The problem of knowledge is 1
how man and objects some l

“This can be done by stress:

the common sense object some
one strand which he can puriiyl

have adequate knowledge, how-
ever, until he puriﬁes and mas-

totally sees how they all can be
together, , , . The unity oi the
dinerent puriﬁed strands one
can isolate out of a common
sense object is a substance more
real than any at those strands
or the common sense obiect

sumes a reality beyond the

BEAUTY

Thursday night’s lecture dcalt

determines the excellence of art
This beauty is identiﬁable with
“one or the other oi nvc differ

However, no one al't alone can

Though mathematics, he said,

Weiss elaborated much further

None oi these by itseli is an
ample criterion. For example,
harmony is “too ooncrctc and
