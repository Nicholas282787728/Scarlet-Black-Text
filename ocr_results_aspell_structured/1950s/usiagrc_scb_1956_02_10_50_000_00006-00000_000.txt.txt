Most important of all, how-
ever, was the great dissatisfac-
tion steady daters expressed
with existing iacillties tor pri-
vacy. The total number of sug-
gestions in this area was sixty»
five for steadies and twenty-
nine [or Casuals, and differences
in specific items were just as
great The desires stated by
steady daters for less supervis~
ion (steady, 21; casual, 11), more
facilities for privacy (steady, 18'
casual, 5), and {or opening
lounges (steady, 10- casual 4)
all point to the fact that this
is an area of vital concern to
these people.

1 Dating Habits

Under the topic of existing
dating habits, it can be said
that Grinnell students date fre-
quently but not excessively (an
average or 2% dates a week
for the sample), and that they
attend planned dating activities
quite ,regularly. House parties
and formal dances are attended
nearly “As oiten as possible";
sports events. informal dances
and recreation. and concerts and
lectures are all utilized as dat-
ing activities between "Fre-
quently" and “Sometimes.”

Rating an average attendance
of “Sometimes" 'are walks.
movies, and coffee or TV dates
in the Union. Study dates and
blanket parties are objects of
dates only slightly more than
“Infrequently.” And contrary to
popular opinion, the Rex and
the Three Elms are visited. on
dates less than “Rarely,”

Some interesting variations
in dating were also discoveredl
Sports events are much more
common as dating activities
with steady than with casual
ﬁlters, but this might he ex—
pected. steady deters are also
much more fond of wallw no
doubt because they are a good
(and cheap) way to he alone

other at times when they
otherwise would feel they
couldn’t take the time.

Something oi a surprise was
the significant contrast tound
between men and women in par-
ticipating in blanket parties.
This difference could be ex-
plained if a few women dated
many men for these activities,
but that doesn’t explain why
steady men reported'going on
them much more often than did
their partners. It appears that
men are more honest in report-
ing in this area than are women.

great amount of interest shown
in increasing concerts and lec-
Lures, especially since twelve

were made by steady daters.
. Are these people more intelli-
gent, serious minded, or m-
ture than casual waters?

One last question had to do
with usual alternatives to plan-
ned school events, Oii-campus
activities such as the movies,
going out to eat, and howling
were by far the most common
activities mentioned, although
the Union, walks, and studying
are also quite popular.

In suggesting possible im-
provements in the dating activi-
