The Boar’s Head tradition,
which dates back to the twelfth)
century, comes to Grinncll fromi
Queen's college, Oxford, Eng.
land. Two legends attempt to
explain the beginnings of the
custom.

One is the ancient rite of
Norseincn of sacrificing a boar
to their god of peace and plenty,
Froyer, who rode a boar on his
religious missions.

The other tells of an English
student who killed a boar by
cramming an Aristotle test down
its throat. The celebration that
followed bccame an annual

Lawrence and Ling had ex~

budget, passed Monday by the
faculty, allots the Cyclone only
$1200 of the $2060 they requested.

“We feel that the major
blame should be attributed to
the adminstration because it
was directly responsible for
what happened: The question of
whether there was or was not
money rcstcd with it.

“There were three checking
points at which our plan could
have been stopped last spring:
the formal meeting of the Stu.

the meeting of the administra-

Given Sanction

In a letter to the Student
Council dated Thursday, De-
cember 3, Dean of the Col—
lege Max E. Fuller proposed
that the central committee
of the Student Council study
the use of the semester fee
to determine the basis on
which the fee should be al-
loted.

Noting the difficulty encoun-
tered this year in distributing
the semester fee, Dean Fuller
suggested “that your committee
meet with representatives of
the Athletics, Drama, Concert
Series, and S&B and discuss the
role of the Student Sem Fee in
those budgets."

This year's semester fee was
finally approved by the fac-
ulty Monday afternoon in the
form in which it was recom—
mended hy the student 0r-,
gallizations committee and the
central committee,

Stating that the allotments
made to athletics, drama. the,
concert series and the 5&3 arc
“in the nature of- student ad—
missions to events—or should
be," Dean Fuller advised that
in drafting future semester fees
a fixed fee for each event per
student be determined and
awarded first, using what is
left for allocation to other ac—
tivities.

“The original theory of the
Sem Fee is that it entitles the
individual student to partici~
pate in a.wide variety of stu-
dent activitias without addition—
al payments of a ticket or dues
nature,” Fuller stated.

“Try to get it back on this
basis, and you will not have
the complications you appear
to be having this year,“ he
concluded.

The central committee took
no action on Dean Fuller’s rec<
oinrnendations when it heard
the letter read by student
Council President Roger Perry
at a meeting Wednesday.

The committee will, however,
send a questionnaire to all or-
ganizations covered by the
semester fee in order to eval~
uate the needs of these organi~
cations and their value to the
college.
