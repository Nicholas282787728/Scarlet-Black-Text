Swim Team

is that two years ago he had
never been on a diving board
as a competitive diver. Although
he didn’t place in the con-
rercnce last year, he mlly lost
one dual meet out of ten.

When he is not on the diving

board, he can usually be [mind

on the trampoline pel'lectmig his
(arm. He has become quite adept
at this sport too, performing
under the stage name
Clutch".

Last Saturday Bill won an-
othor diving contest at No»
hraska in the season's first
tllml ineet. He hopes to equal
and possibly better his own
records this year. As tor the
swimming team he has this to
say, ”1 think we’re stronger
than we were last year, and
with all things being equal,
we'll do much better this
year.”

At any rate, Bill will be in
there doing his share towards
making this Grinnell’s host
swimming season.
