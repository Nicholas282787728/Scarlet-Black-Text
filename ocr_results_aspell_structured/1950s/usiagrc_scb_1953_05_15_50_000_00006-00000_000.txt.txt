cause of the time element.

each student less. with
everyone receiving a copy
the cost of the book could
be reduced by lo per cent,
possibly more, because the
contracts could be signed
earlier in the year. We feel
the 5 dollar charge is a rear
sonable charge, but the book
costs each student consider
ably more after the $2.50
charge for junior and senior 1
pictures, and the 15 dollar
per page for any club or or»
ganization’s inclusion in the
book. ,
The history ol our annual. the
Cyclone, reveals a very unstable
pattern of existence. in 1931 the
students voted unanimously that
the yearbook expenses be taken
from the sem fee. The faculty
vetod the idea because of the
“linancial crisis of the times."
In 1939 the students voted 497-13
that the cost of the Cyclone be'
taken out of room deposit after
a book had not been printedi
lsince 1935. with the entire stu.§

what the ccislon is. They
should not meet and talk over[
what each one thought about the
various aspects of the competls

cuss their thoughts to each

possibility that n judge may
change his mind as a result of
such discussion. This is defeat
