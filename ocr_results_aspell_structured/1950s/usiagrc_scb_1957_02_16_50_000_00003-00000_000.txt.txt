i see student government as
rightfully operating in two re
lated areas. Since our purpose
in attending college is the pur-
suit of an education, we, as stu-

y. dents, trust in the judgment of
f faculty and administration who

work to make our goals attaina
able.

Thus, student government pers
forms these two functions it

may assume control of activities

Mchnlscy

Throughout this campaign I
have\ sought to make clear one
point: change ‘can only take
place by workipg within the
existing framework of student
government. The student Coun—
cil is the central agency through
which the opinions and desires
of the entire student body are
coordinated and presented to the
faculty and administration, The
core of my platform is to make
sure the council performs this.
function efficiently,

New officers and the reorgan-
ization of existing committees
are unnecessary. I plan to co—
ordinate and utilize the present
machinery of the council
giving the committee deﬁnite re-
sponsibility, streamlining the
council meeting and making
sure the Students, faculty and
administration are mutually
aware ol each other's problems
and desires. ,

l thereforc um emphasizing
personal contacts instead , oi
printed reports as the best way
to publicize and coordinate [he
goals of the Council. Responsi-
bility for the communication of
student opinion must Come pri-
marily through the constructive
recommendations of ball repre—
sentatives, rather than formal-
ized and ineffective allscampus
gripe sessions. _

i am thus mainly Concel‘nl‘d

problems dealing with the Coke

objectives toward which i feel
the student Council should move
in the very near future, These
are increased student-faculty
administration - student gover
ment communication and co-
operation; improved counseling
and academic procedure; exten-
sion of the Student Council CX'
Ecutive role; and extension of
Student Council reviews such as
that now going on in the union.
Under each of these headings l
have detailed speciﬁc measures
,leading to the Objectives. Tl‘ese
together form my platlorm,

In the communications and res
view area, some progress has
already been made, much still
needs to be done. The counsel-
ing arca demands immediate at
tention on several matters. The
role oi the Student Council

Since the governing bodies of
north and south campus respec—
tively assume responsibility ior
activities which pertain to them
alone, it is the obligation of
Student Council to work for all
of the students. A person who

Subrnit Platforms

Sixteen late entrants into
the 'ce for the Student
Council presidency announced
their candidacy late Thurs~
day night

Mike Goodrich. Langan, out-
lines his platform as follows:

“My belief is that the student
council has had no real power
in the last three years. Nothing
of great importance or of last-
ing significance has been accom-
plished by the existing organi-
zatianY the Student Council,

“I sincerely believe that if
a drastic reorganization oi the
council is not in order to give
the students some authority as
at other schools, it will have
to be abolished. i stand as an
abolitionist candidate.

“I believe that a small font»
mittee of genuinely inter sted
people could serve as an effi-
cient sounding board for student
opinion and could actively con-
duct all campus activities and
serve to delegate authority to
the proper bodies for appropriate
action.

“I feel that the coke machine
question could be accurately and
effectively handled by the c of
HP and League Board in con-
junction. However, this proposed
committee eould take this author-
ity too.

“I believe the counseling sys-
tems proposed siiould be hand-

led by the authority.vested iii
the dean of the college, the
dean of men and the dean oi
women, 1 stand behind a sySv
tern similar to the one pro-
‘posed by Mr, Lovell two years
ago."

“My platform consists of two
points," said Richard Hewitt
also of Langan. “I am for uni-
fied student government. 1 m
not overly impressed with tie
position.”

Tony Dalsiincr, who has de»
clared himself ‘L‘ampaign manae
ger for the masses‘ has announ—
ced the entrance of ten other
Langan iunioi-s as “jag" candi~
