CofHP Against
Hazing Program

The C- of HP, after review—
ilig the north campus prep-
‘ping program, voted to rec-
ommend to‘ next year’s
.C of HP that hazing be abol—
lslled.

The council declared that haZ<

ing “is not consistent with
relillcr the established goals or
‘freshman orientation or the
lideals of Grinncll college. and
that anything positively accom-
‘plished by hazing may be gain—
,ed in some other manner which
:is less objectionable to many
Ipeople.”
i It wns also recommended
that the new Co-iHr establish
“a rule with appropriate nun-
itive action to deter any haz—
ing oi the ireshmen."

If hazing is discontinued the
council suggested the rest of the
present orientation program
should “be discarded, and an at.
tempt made to reevaluate and
:recstablish the meaning of hell
membership and the purpose of
treshmen initiation.”

The C of HP urged that “more
‘emphasis be placed on both
the 1M and social programs of
‘the individual halls and the
‘intellcctual and cultural as.
pects oi the college as a whole.“
Seine of the specific sugges-
tions offered in this area were
to encourage treshmen attend-
ance at concerts and coffee
hours and to implement the
present hall counseling system.

: ”Freshman orientation should

ideally continue as long as
; necessary, but the concen-
trated period of orientation

ishould last about six to eight
lwecks." The c of HF thus rec-
ommended that “some type or
ifreshman-sophomore or allvcaln-
pus tield day be established to
replace Hell Night as the cli-
max or the organized [section
of the program."

Finally, the council urged that
“the individual house councils
should begin thinking and
working on trcshnian oricnia-
tion as soon as possible in the
spring. as the success of any
program will depend a
great deal on how much work
is put in ahead of time.”
