Late in the third quarter the
Pioneers began to click and the
change in the Pioneer eleven
was evident from the stands, A

line tally by the Pioneer full~

To the Editvr:

Now that the 1M foobball sear
son is over and we can look at
it as one who backs away from
a book to sec the whole page,
i would like to comment on
something about which i feel
quite strongly,

As I attended one of the
ﬁrst football games my at.
tention was drawn to the trio
of referees who were not doa
ing a very sterling job of offi—
ciating. This, however, did not
shock me for two reasons,
First, it was early in the sea-
son. Second and the most un—
fortunate reason, you just can
not expect to see good referees
at a Grinnell 1M game with
out being disappointed half
the time. You may think my
judgment is too harsh and so
did I at first. But read on.

Later in the season these. same
rcferees (and God only knows
Why they were nut separated)
were not Only arguing among
themselves but they had begun
to specialize. The timekeeper
had become so perplexed by the
little metal object in his hand
that be disregarded it and I
think started looking toward the
heavens to time the game, the
"downswounter" had obviously
lost some of his ﬁngers some.

where and the sideline referee
continually staggered up and
down the ﬁeld between plays so
no one knew where to put the
ball. The referees should have
been penalized 15 yards for dea
laying the game.

We have heard a lot lately
about becoming more intcllec—
tual and all that rot. Well,
why not? And let’s carry it
right into IM sports. Perhaps
this trio I speak of was the
only had one of the bunch but
you know the old story about
the rotten apple. Why have
any bad ones when we know
there are many others who
would do a much better job.

Yin told referees get 50c per
game. Why not increase this?
it is possible and would be
worth it. It is also a fact that
1M referees do not show up at
meetings in which rules are dis—
cussed, Perhaps they could be
paid for attending these meet—
ings.,And lastly, let’s give each
one of them a complete list of
the rules rather than having
just one or two rulebooks for
the whole school. IM’s arc a
wonderful spirit builder and are
extremely important to our hall

system. Let’s work toward im-I

proving them.
