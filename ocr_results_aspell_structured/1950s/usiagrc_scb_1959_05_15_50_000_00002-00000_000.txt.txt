tiof'HP—Bull In The China Shop

Last Wednesday night the Coi'HP suffered the great,
/ loss of dignity that we have witnessed in our three-y - '
i at Glinnell.

 

Finingr tile Spring Day committee was all absurd act,
at the least. As was pointed out iii the CoiHF’s letter notif -
' the committee ol’ the fine, tllis was an “unusual in
(ll—ht." So llnusilal, we believe, that the Cole" should have
c certained whether or not they had the 1' it to fine the
CU mittee, which, as was shown Wednesday night, they did
“CE. ‘

Some of us feel that our $.50 contribution to the Coil-{P

1' .mi our social fee is enough. Must we also pay them a '

t ute for the legitimate actions of oilr Student Council in

tlie planning: of oilr Spring Day '3 Let them get their money

. pins (approximately $16 apiece), ﬂashlights (10 a year)

parties (rumor has it there's one at Lombardi’s nex
next \i'eeliﬁmaybe it’s free) somewhere else.

The mistake was realized by the CofHP too late. its
'al oversight was exposed andllad to be admitted to in a
lie meeting. Members of the Coil-1P who have, and de-
e, our respect as indi idilals were ioi'ced. to do their

mantic best in trying to justify their actions, at least ill
pent.

One Coi'HP member who desei'VQs this respect as an in-

di idual took great painsto re ‘eal that Steve Faunce was a

le Griilnell animal and therefore came under the jurise

' tion of the CofHP in this case. Student Council meetings
not meant to be labs in human anatomy.

il:'_
P'

Sec

The CofHP made itself appear even more ridiculous by
dvclaring~ itself in session, lvitlldl wing the fine and imply-
]; ' publicly that Faunce as an ilidi dual would be fined for
{he aelt he committed as a representative of ‘the Student

_ “Ii-Ci .

The salient point is what will the CofHP choose to do
i). \ 7 Will they proceed with their threat to Mr. Failncc as
:l‘ individual and heap more disparagement upon their c017
le'tive s‘eli",7 Or will they involie tl‘s vet-to~be-re\’ealed
d cretion and let their self-admitted mls like fade into the
and be forgotten?

Separilhﬁlﬁowers

Up to this year the appointment of cleaning- agency
ads and assistants lids been handled by the Central Com-
ttee and'the Committee on Student Organizations. Since

on was made to dishalid the latter committee, the

appointments of heads and a ants reverted to the Cell-
t‘al Committee and ii 3 subiect to the approval of the deans
(>1 illcn and women.

After the Central Committee l'loundercd through the
choices this year, they'voted to give the right of choice to
tie AWS Board and Col'l‘IP for next year. .

lOui' point is that the whole question i olie that does
