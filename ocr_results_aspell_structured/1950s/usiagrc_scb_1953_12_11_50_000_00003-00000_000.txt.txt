Last year a survey of leading colleges

my, Levy ,
clﬂtY'

throughout the country showed that
smokers in these colleges preferred
Luckies to any other cigarette.

This year another far more extensive,

'and comprehensive surveyisupervised
by college professors and based on more
than 31,000 actual student interviews—
shows that Luckies lead again over all

other brands, regular

or king size..,and

by a wide margin! The No, 1 reason:

Luckies taste better.

Smoking enjoyment is all a matter of
taste, and the fact of the matter is Luckies
- taste betterehrat, because L.s./M.F.T._

Lucky Strike means

hne tobacco. And

second, Luckies are made better _to taste

better. So, Be Happy—

Go Lucky! l
