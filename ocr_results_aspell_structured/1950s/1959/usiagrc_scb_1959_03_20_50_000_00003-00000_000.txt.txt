Oberlin Alum Conlemplal’es

Problems Conc

ED. NOTE: The iollowing
column, “V0 ,e hour the Cel-
lar," is lrom the March 5 is-
sue oi the Oberlin News
Tribune of Oberlin, Ohio, it
was written by Charles A,
Mosher and concerns the dis-
pute over the “open dorm"
which exists at Oberlin col-
lege. Moshcr, an Ohio state
senator, is a graduate or Ober-
lin and owner ot the News-
Tribune. .

Needless to siiy, the views
expressed in this column on
not necessarily retlect the
opinion or either the editor or
teature editor oi the Scarlet
and Black. l

We outsiders, viewing front a
distance the eu ent tiiror on
Oberlin gllcgc's campus over
;‘pi‘ivzlcy," are disposed to smile
at it as being quite juvenile,
and somewhat inane, i suspect
many of the students also see it
that way.

But evidently a great many
very vocal students soc it from
another perspective; it seems to
be a matter of very serious con-
cern to them,

Can a couple, boy and girl,
date privately in, the boy's
bedroom? That seems to lie
the question which preeipltat-
ed .this past month's agonizing
reappraisal on campusi (Mys»
tery to onlookers, why is not
the same question raised eon-
eeruing the girls’ rooms?)

’It seems that several years
ago, in an etioi-t to improve at
least slightly Oberlin’s admitted-
ly rather drab social life. the
college authorities permitted
“section parties" to be held in
the smaller houses ior men and
in the various sections of the
larger dorms. The college conr‘
celvcd of these'as strictly group
social functions, in which the
house social chairman, housc di-l
’rector and all participants werci

dating events, and not only llic’rather

downstairs parlors but the Stu» ,
denls’ rooms could be used, but
with a strict door open
and presumably urth a crowd
always present or imminent. ,,
Recently, however, the deans
say, some couples have been
abusing that privilege and in—
stead of the “group social an
tivitics" have been dating in the
privacy oi the men’s rooms. On

discussion. Faculty members
on the Men's Board (a coma
bined stiidont-iaculty group
with original authority in such
matters) have attempted to

 

limit the discussion to the
original question or private
dating in student bedrooms,

and to make clear that the
college torbids that. But the
students view the dimensions
of the argument as much largr
er; they have raised the per.
ennial question oi “luck of
privat‘y” in Oberlin.

Last Friday arieinoon. when
the Men’s Board met with sew
el'al dozen representatives or
other student groups, both men
and women. student spokesmen
refused to conﬁne the discussion
to the narrower question ol
house party regulations and tlc-‘
mended that the faculty mom:
bcrs present settle larger prob
lems well beyond the- autho
ity. the meeting was adjourned
and most of the faculty walked
out. The students then organiecd
an indignation session of their,
own.

 

“Don't you trust us?” That is
the. question with which the SLIP
dents lrcqucntiy attempt to cons
iound college onicials. And to
that question the proper answer,
it seems to me, is this, “Certain
iy we trust you, to exactly the
same extent that most of your
parents trust you and that our
society in general trusts healthy,
normal young people of roman.
tic age. We trust your good in-
tentions, but not your ability to.
stay out of trouble when dating
in the privacy of a bedroom."

Sex .is wondertiil, The recip—
rocal attraction between gal
and guy is good and beautitul,
and should not be considered
evil; it is desirable, and dc»
serves to be encouraged.

But sex is also powerlull Ii.

precisely the circum-
bctwcen gal and guy will pro

matul‘ely go BOOM! The rate

of probability is such as to al»
low iairly accurate predictions.

Such premature
make serious trouble tor all
concerned. True, the burned
marriages which result may
prove to be very ﬁne, happy
and permanent. But thcre ’also

social behavior oi students
while they are here, unless
that is the basic understand

responsibility on the college
to establish and enforce rea-

student conduct. And dating
by couples privately in (lol'i'n
