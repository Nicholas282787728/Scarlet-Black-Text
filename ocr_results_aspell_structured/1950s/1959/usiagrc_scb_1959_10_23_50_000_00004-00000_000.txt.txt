How can the Grinnell student

marrow night, and he can make
a pledge in the drive during
the two Weeks following.

The goal is swell—$2,000 or

To the Editor:

Those upperclassmen, raculty
and visitors who attended Dr.
Clark Hopkins’ lecture on
l-lomeric art (part or the iresh—
man humanities course) were
privileged to see an unanticipat-
ed, truly remarkable display or
the pre—simian characteristics
of our class of '63.

Dr. Hopkins slides were ac.
companied by a swelling wave
of enthusiastic murmurs which,
when it reached its peak, would
drop into abrupt silence with
the appearance of a sculpture
or a nude athlete on the screen.
The rest of the time a few
members or this year’s cream of
the crop, regrettably already be-
ginning to sour, rcmainrrl un-
democratically quiet, or slept.

Several. however, oi the more
demonstrative, outgoing major-
ity, exhibited a charming, child-
like agility as they cavorted
among the seats and along the
railings of the balcony in their
escape to the other side of the
curtains. And beyond the cur-
tains, still appropriately aprv
plauded by their spiritual tela
lows, they proved endearingly,
adolescently inept when faced
with the problem of opening
doors. l

To the Editor:

I found Dr, Hopkins’ lecture
on Homeric art interesting and
enjoyed most of it. As a fresh-
man, i had ﬁgured on an
amount of difficulty in adjusting
to the strenuous pattern of
Grinnell life and studies, but I
had not planned on the minute
amount of leg room in ARK au-
diioriurn. l have great reverence
for those nonrpl‘imitive upper
Classwomen who have learned
to retain their self-respect when
their legs are completely cramp-
edgie, not squirm.
