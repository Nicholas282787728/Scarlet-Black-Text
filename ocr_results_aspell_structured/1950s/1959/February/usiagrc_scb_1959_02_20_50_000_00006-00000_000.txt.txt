Hunt Evaluates His Past Year

by Gordy Hunt

It is customary for the Stu-
dent Council president to make
an evaluation ot his year in
office and his council in the
context of the election ot his
successor, i hope that i will be
able to present an objective
evaluation of the council’s past
year in order that plans tor
next year might have the bEne—
ﬁt of my experience

The things which 1 have to
say are. ot course, only my
opinions. However, they are
opinions based on tact and an
intimate knowledge of the
past year and might in some
sense he valuahle.

The ﬁrst thing which I think
is important in a consideration
of the Student Council, past and
tuturc, is a realization ot the
fact that the Student Council
president is not the Student
Council. I cannot state strongly
enough the fact that detel‘lnlnztr
tion of a future council's worth
lies as much in the selection
of members of the council as in
the election at the president A
council president can greatly
inﬂuence the council, but it
would he a slant on the student
body to suppose that a presi-
dcnt could completely dominate

In Student Council

 

ings duelling on the managv
ment of the “Coke" concession
have not occurred The opera-
tion of the concussion, however,
has bccn put on o sounder,
more businesslike basis than
over in the past, This is but
one case illustrating the tact
that a body as large as the
council can chectitvcly deliber-
atc and come to sound decisions
if it is composed ot capable
individuals and is cilicicntly
managed,

I have Selected» two issues
which the council has consid-
ered this past year which I
think are the most important
and will have the most last-
ing edccts. I would like to
consider them here to show
the reasons tor the council's
actions and the results to the
council and the campus as I
see them.

The first ot these two issues
is the agreement rcachcd be-
tvvccn the council and the Su—
cial Calendar committee re
garding social and govel‘nlncw
tal tunds. The council agreed
to accept responsibility [or the
operating budgets oi the c ot
HP and the AWS Board. in Ten
turn, the Social Calendar coma
mittcc agreed to accept lull i-ee
sponsihihty tor the ﬁnancing ot
the. Gadaoouts program and the

Ol‘irCampus social program.

Through this agreement, ri-
iiaiicial responsibility ior so-
cial programs is iurthor cone
centrated in the Social Calen—
dar committee and all money
tor administrative and 1:7an
crnmental purposes will now
come trom the council’s hodg—
ct. This, in my opi ion, is
much hotter organization Fur-
ther, it lcnds more credence
to the conception ot the stu-
dent Council as the supreme
studcnt governing body on
campus This gives the council
more prestige which it has
sorely lacked in the past.

A second issue which I regard
as important and symptomatic
or sound judgment on the part
at the council is the continued
supot't of KGRW. Pi'ttt'ious to
last year, something like $2000
or $3000 had alrcady boon me‘
\‘cslcd in KGRW in an cﬂol‘t to
complete all improvements pru-
gt‘am which would etlablc the
station to operate. To have writ—
tcn this oil as a bdtl investment
and ceased to support the star
lion would have been very bad‘
busincss, in my opinion,

The council. however.
ed the station to complete
program. Further, the councill
committed itsclt to payment of;

salaries to Kchw personnel to
insure that. ﬁle invcslment
might pay dividends this year
and in the future. in the. cone
text of [he prior investment In
KGRW, this was the only sensV
iblc thing- that [he council
could have done. To have donc
it in the light oi considerable
student opinion to the. contrary
is something tor which the
council can be commended,

The age-old problem or ad-
ministcring a concert program
again plagued the council in
the past year. The council at—
tempted to solve the probe
lcin in a new way through
the use of a Concert commit»
tee. The committee. however.
was no more successful and
no worse than methods usctl

in previuus years. This wits
probably the council's most
conspicuous failure, As :1 rev
sult of this year's experience,
I think (hilt, the council will
he able to solve this problem
satisfactorily. What I think is
a workable plan has been
evolved and recommended to
next, year’s council.

Limitation ot my space pi'c~
cludcs turthcr consideration ot
the past year, but may 1 say
that I am happy with the \‘CC*
ord of the last year from a
personal standpoint and {mm
the standpoint of the council.
My position has involved a
great deal of work and consi -
erahlc time, but it has been an
interesting and very rewarding
experience.
