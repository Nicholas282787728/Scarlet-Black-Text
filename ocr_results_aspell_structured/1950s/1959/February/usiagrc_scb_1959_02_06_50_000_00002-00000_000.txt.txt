Why?
s- t r
Council took what wc think could be a "big step in the right
dirccticn" this wcclr with their action in regard in the c oi HP
and AWSB iunds These two bodies will now reccwc their allot-
mcnts irom thc council, not from tho sooial calcndor committee.
This in itsolt. does not have iar reaching citccts it simply allm
thc calendar committee to have morc lunds available tor Gadzi»
bouts or [or any other social lunclion, '

We think the council should not only dole out the funds
to the C of HP and AW'SB but that tliinsc two bodies should be
financially responsible to the council. That is, they should sub-
mit a budget to the council and any Excess Funds in their treas-
ury at the end of the school year should be turned over to the
council for disposition as the Council sees fit.

All this Could not be accomplished at. the snap of B finger.
C o1 HP and AWSB have been granted their funds by the truss
ices. This would have (0 be changed Lind we think it. should be—
al. the insistence of the council.

_it is also true that the revenue taken in by the two bodies
varies from mouth to month and year to year. but they should
be able to make some estimate at their income and at the'end
ot the year submit a statement to the council so we would know
.pist where the money has gone.
