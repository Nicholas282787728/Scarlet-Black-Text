Pioneersﬁ losow Four—Face U. of Chicdgo Tomorrow
? ' in

by Garland neNelsky

The Grinnell basketball team,
after emerging victorious from
all three of its first games, ran
into trouble and dropped four of
its last five contests.

The Pioneers defeated Mon-
mouth, while losing to Knox,

Lake Forest. Beloit and Wart-
burg. Only Knox and Monmouth
counted as conference games
however, and Grinnell still
holds a respectable 3-1 record
in Midwest Conference play.

On December 12, the Pioneers
traveled to Galesburg, Illinois,
where they dropped a close 67-
54 decision to Knox. Grinnell
trailed 34.33 at halftime, and
was unable to gain any kind of
lead on the Siwash. The Pie-
neers hit 29 times from the
field to 28 for Knox, but were
able‘ to sink only 6 of 15 free
throws. Grinnell center Bill
McClintoclr led all scorers with
26 points.

Grinnell got back on the
win trail the next evening
against the Scots at Mon-
mouth. The pioneers were in
control of Monmouth‘s soph-
omore-laden team nearly all
the way, leading 33% at half-
time. The Pioneers scored on
48 per cent ot their shots
from the tield, well above
average. in addition the Pio-
neeas dominated the rebound-
ing, grabbing as rebounds as
compared with 42 for the los-
ers. McClintook led the scor-
ing with 23, while Paul Kant:-
ler collected 11 and Jon
Grotclnschen lo. Sophomore
Jim Simmons collected 17 re-
bounds for Grninell.

Grinneil made its next ap-
pearances at the Grinnell holi—
day double headers here last
Friday and Saturday. Other
teams appearing here were Lake
Forest, Beloit and Knox.

Lake Forest downed Grinnell
76—64. For the first time all
season the Pioneers were second
best in the rebounding depart-
ment, with 53 rebounds as com-
pared with 53 for the winners.
The score alternated throughout
the first half with Lake Forest
holding a 35-31 halftime edge,

The tollowing night Grin-
nell fell victim: to Belolt's sec-
end-half scoring spree, 79-10.
The Ploneels were down 34.23
at hnlxtinre. Midway through
the last half, Bololt guard
Paul Hudgcns scored 11 com
secutive points to keep his
team ahead of the Pioneers.
Hudgens scored a total of 33
points which was the high
tor all four games or the dour

bleheaders.

In addition, Beloit utilized
its fast break eilecﬁvely and
scored on 47 per cent of its
ﬁeld goal attempts, While the
Pioneers could connect on
only 34 per cent of their
tries.

Wartburg college defeated
Grinnell in an overtime TueSA
day at Waverly, 78-75, despite

Simmon’s 27-point effort for the

probably will give Grinnell a
“rough go," at least on the basis
of comparative scores. Chicago
beat Lawrence by the exact
score the Pioneers compiled
against that team, 57-54, and
lost a close game to Ripon by
62.55. Grinnell downed the lat-
ter by ten points.
