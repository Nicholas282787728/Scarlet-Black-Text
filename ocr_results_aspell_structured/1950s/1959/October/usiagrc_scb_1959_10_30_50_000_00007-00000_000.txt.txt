i The Pioneers, who thus for in
-the season have made a habit
oi coming close but never close
cnough, will be going against
a team that has to be labeled
the most impressive in the
league from its pcrtormance to
‘date.

Cornell boasts a big, tough
line in lront oi a last, hard-
driviiig backfield. The Rams
have rolled up 129 points to
their opponents 14 in their
first six games; they have had

trouble only against One. The
’Kohawks heat Cornell, 6-0,
on a day when the weather
, and breaks may have had
quite a bit to do with the
outcome.

The Rams have talent and
depth to burn Their line cam—
'bines agility and speed with the
‘wcight to open gaping holes.
in particular, the middle of the
‘deicnsivc line stands out, with
lsueh men as Jim Bellamy, 223
pounds. Dave Conaway, 225, and
Frank Millet, 230, bottling up
the enemy running attack.

3 North Younkcr is the 1959
lcrinnell IM tootball champion.
‘North gained this distinction
lby deieating Dibble yesterday
tatternoon, one, on MacEachron
tﬁcid.

‘ For the ﬁrst time in many

years, one game decided the
, championship, and North re—
, sponded in this all—important
clash to clinch the victory
, The game was strictly a de-
, tensive battle, as the score
1 indicates.
‘ The winning points were scor»
ed following a pass intercepr
ition by North linebacker John
‘Karraker, deep in Dibble terrle
tory. Following two unsuccess<
Iul passes, North tailback Don
Olsson moved to his leit and
ﬁred [0 end Charlie Turner tor
the six-pointer,

The touchdown was scored
midway in the third quarter,
and North stayed ott a num-
ber or Dibble attacks in the
remainder ot the game to
hang on to its winning edge.
The game ieatured savage line
i and downﬁctd blocking, and
it was agreed by most specta-
tors that this was onc oi the
ﬁnest m iootball games in
recent history,

Second, third, and fourth
places are as yet undecided and
will be determined by the out
come of the ﬁnal season game
pitting Smith against, Cowles
