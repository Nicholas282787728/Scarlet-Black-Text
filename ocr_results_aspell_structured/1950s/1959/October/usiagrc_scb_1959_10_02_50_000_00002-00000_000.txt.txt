except for a feature article ill the Des Moines Register last
Sunday. In it Dean til" Men Eail F. Pe' ner and C 01' HP pres-
ident Dick Ramsdell told of the workings and aims of this
ytar's program.

Now this kind of article is great ptiblicity for the col»
lost but the aims of the program as stated therein do not
apply in our opinion.

. To quote the article: “They (the aims) are to develop
in the freshmen the ‘spil'it and tradition of Ci'iililell.’ and to
foster i realizat' n of the opportunities which Grililiell col-
lege and college life ol'i'er.‘ ”

We do not believe that sitting. on the floor and being
harassed at'liouselneetings. taking forced marches at mid

ti swatted alid above all, reading Al stotle aloud on the

 

     

 

 

 

. wit and tr dition of Grinllell" nor “a realization of the
opportunities which Grililiell college and college life offer.”

And we do not understand “hell: “doing yard work or
shing \ll'ndows at one of the old people’s homes or earli-
money for the hall,” has to do with “the spirit and tra-
ioll of G '1i1iell."

Grinliell is certainly much more than the above acti
ii and more likely, an antithesis to most of them. Prep-
ping develops iii the freshman the spirit and tradition of
prepping alid fosters a realization of the opportunities
\lllich prepping has to offer and nothing more.

According: to Ramsdell, we are initiating the freshmen
"litto college life on a little more mature basis” this yealz
From what we have seen and heard thus far, the program is
more like than different from programs of the past. And
since it 11- been shortened l'rom si‘ to three \leeks, it
\ltiuld follow that the spirit and tradi on of Grillllell have
also diminished.

Surely the terms “introduction” and "orientation"
have been twisted and preverted by the linguistically ins
clined upperclassiiien who have substituted harassment, brow
butting, belittlement and back side pounding (in the noble
rztliie of cha tater building; of course) as suitable synonyms.
indeed these are strange handshakes offered to our new
friends: indeed it is an awkward orientation to Griimell
\lhieh ill truth i not half as barbaric as prepping would
stem to indicate. Hopeful we are that society will not make
\l‘ ”button" before we can reach the coveted “lirgroups”.

But let us ask one question about prepping. (Here at
the bottom of the dull editorial rig'e where it can be easily
enough ignored without elilbar sment to anyone.) The
question is asked of the upperel; smell who are ardent
plcppinl: fans:

Is it not trite, that if you honestly had the 'l'resllninii’s
introduction and orientation in mind you would sit down
in all atmosphere 01' honor and respect and discuss problems
and interests with him instead of addre ng' him with only
yt-lls. threats and swats and listening only to his forced
sclf-belitllemeiit‘.’

St 'aiig‘e, What friendship and understanding can come
of discus. 'on. Strange too. that prepping continues to exist
on a campus proud of its intelligence.
