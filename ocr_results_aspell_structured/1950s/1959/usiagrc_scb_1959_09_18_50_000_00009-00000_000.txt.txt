“Spectators will witness

the most wide open, exciting
brand of football ever play-
ed at Grillllell college." This
was Coach Bob Peterson's
comment in regard to his
team’s season opener against
Monmouth here tomorrow,
starting at 1:30 p.m,

Last year's Monmouth-Grin-
ncll contest ended in a 12.12 tic.
Monmouth has 21 returning let
.tcrmen from its 1953
.while Grinnell has 11. Included
in the Picnccls' graduation
:losscs was John Copeland, 150-1
,pourul tailback who currently
.holds Grinnell's total offense
record.

The Pioneers have institut—
~cd an oiicnsc entirely diiicr-‘
c'ut from the Tennessee single-
wing which has been employ-
.cd herc during recent sell-
sons. Grinucll will move the
ball from the wing-T, on of.
icnsc which Peterson says is
better suited to the matcrial
on hand.

Senior Bob Woito will quar-
lel'back this now oilcnsc. The
rcmamdcr o[ Gl'lnllell’s start-
ing offensivc backfield includes
junior Jim Lowry at fullback,
junior Jack Woods at one half
back and sophomore John Har-
tung at the other halfback po-
sition. Of this quartet, only
Lowry saw a great deal of ac-
tion lost season, when he not-
tcd 426 yards rushing.

Grinnell's offensive line will
consist of Bob Rikkel-s and
Jim Simmons at lcit and right
and respectively, Dick dei
at right (ﬁckle, Ron Gustavson
ht lelt tackle, Frank Scott at
, right guard and Bud Hulse at
left guard. Tcrry Moore will
round out the lineup at cen-
ter. Last year Simmons placs
crl on the all—Midwest Con»
icrcncc sccond team, and
Ynki rcccivcd an honorable
mention rating,

Key men in the Ploncers' de-
lensil'e unit are Roger Smith
and Ernie Rutherford. Oihers

’ who will attempt to stop Mon-
mmllll's offensive strength ins
cluclo Dick Hal Roy Simp-
son, Dick Barbou Jerry Born,
Dick Hoickvnm. G Jones, Ray
Rogers, Ron Sandlcr and Halg
Kosbkariau.

Although Peterson hos out
lined his main defensive and
olicnsivc units, it is probable
that there will be some
switching oi milnpuwcr‘ be-
tu-ccn tbc two teams as the
season progrcsscs.

Conch Peterson remarked
that Grinnell’s team will have
to spot Monmouth u

on any football squint
added that the Pioneer dc-
icnsivc team will he cspccihl—
ly hurt because of 2 lock of
size, but will attempt to make
up the difference with on c

curly to mnkcany kind of a
statement as to the team‘s
overall strength, but that
sincc Grinncll luis only four

year‘s team, mistakes hre like-
ly to be prevalent.

Tomorrow at 1:30 pm. is kick-‘

lootbnll game, d iootball season}
and an athlctic‘ year at Grinncll
begin. What is the slgnihcanc
or this for the student at this
college?

At Grinnell, it is safe tol
say that college lilc is not can»
tered nround athletics._ as is
the case with on evcrsincrens- ,
ing number of collcgcs hnd l
universities today. but, on the ,
other lnnd. athletics are not i
slightcd and placed at the
bottom rung ol the :lctiviiies
lnddcr.

As evidenced by last year‘s
line basketball team, a highly
successful season in any givcn
sport can gcncralc a good deal
of cxcitomcnl and enthusiasm
on tho campus.

it is indccd a simple fact
that following a winning teflm

more plcosurablc than watch»

They also usc pressurc for tho

‘ Actions Such as these are ill

hC'ddCd by best foulluu‘tly; at worst they I dividual or loam. It

threaten to eliminate :u-nateur

i athletics altogether and even

substhntihlly w c a k e u the
structurc or higher education.

The point of all this rambling
is to say that while "winning"

lis exciting. enjoyable and satis—
liying to both participants and

all connected with a given sport,
and should not be underestimat—
ed. it should not. at the same
time, be considcrcd the only
possible end in athletic camper
tition.

Any person who truly do-
rives enjoyment from debat-
ing. cal-d phying or athletics
will not lose interest in any
of these iiclds mcrcly becaust
winning is not automatic.
Similarly, a student body
should not lehvc a stadium
vacant simply Ilecausc the
prospccts of winning seem to
bc rcmole.

Grinnell’s current football
tram does not promise to be a
'tlo conlcndcr. Picked by the

idwcst Conference officials to

ish uncomfortably close to
last place, without thc services
a! several of last year's top
players. and employing an on
tiraly new oifensc, hopes for a
winning season arc dismal.

And yet, ironi my casual
observation of practice ses-
sions, Grinllell‘s 1959 gridiron
forces will give everything

Carleton: Eight of thc Carl's

Schmucker, leading ground gains
or m Carleton football history,
and all-conference tackle Gerry
Erickson. are missing from the

Albconiergncc guard
George Williams leads the re-
turnees. Whrrcn Boson describes
his squad as strong defensxvelv

the largest squad in the confer-
cncc, and Beson always comes
up with a top tnamain his
three-year tenure, the Carls have
negcl‘ finished lower than see
on .

Ripon: The Redmen are hard-

hit by the graduation of two 3117
time Ripon greats: Littlc All-
American cnd Pee Kasson and
threcstime all-conference full-
back Davo Smith, who holds thc
confer-once scoring record, and
is now on the roster of thc
Crccn Bay Packers. Dick Cellchs
owski, who led conference scor-
ing in 1957, is the only veteran
in a backfield which is Consider—

Jnck Flaker will anchor at strong

zcr thinks his squad is a year
away: much depends on Dick
Montonati. who could becomc a
star quarterback, and on the
progress of a talented group of
sophomores.

st. Olaf: In his second yeah
Tom Porter is guardcdly opii—
mistic. Except at quarterback
and center vacated by second-
tcam conference chnices Nnic
Schiotc and Duane Swensull
(now lrcsbman coach), St,
Olaf is stronger in cvery posi-
tion. After a year’s cxpcricncc

the Oles should be more con.

Unless the scoondycar men
fall below expectations or lack
of experience at quarterback
proves ihtcl, so Olaf should
improve on last year‘s 474 m-
ord.

Cornell: Jerry Clark, the only

the Rams are to capitalize on

year's undoicatcd frosh team

mons. fullback Jim Lowry, thc
only returning backﬁeld reg-
ular, and honorablermenﬁon

last year's subs and the sophr
more contingent, which has
two promising backs in Run
Sandlcr and John ilartung.
John Copeland, the mighty
mite who set an all-time Pio-
neer oiicnsivc record. will be
missed.

Knox: The picture is brighter
tat Kno. than it has been for
the preceding two years. Junior
Brown. one of the nation's lead—
ing small-college punters, is the
only abscntec from the 1953
backfield, and the interior line is
intact except for center. The
ends may pose a problem, houu
ever. A talented sophomore
group is handicapped by the fact
that last year’s freshman sched-
ule was cancelled because oi in-
sufficient turnout. Depth may
be a problem. the Siwashers
having one of the smallest con-
ference squads.

Monmouth; For the first time
in recent years Monmouth has
depth, since Joe Pelisek has a
squad of 43, second largest in
the conference. Pelisek charan
terizes his backfield as stronger
than last year's. the line about
the same. End Gary Wellman
and fullback Chuck Lmdstrom
could be outstanding,

Lawrence: Despite the loss
of his best lineman, all-con—
, icrcncc tackle Carl Schwcdn—
lcr, and his best book, honor

Muliorcl. Bernie lieselton ex<
pects his 1959 team to be bet-
ter than last year’s. Except
Muliord, the backfield is in-
tact; cupinin .Dave ilcckwor-
thy, on b o n o r a b l er‘mention
rccntcr, heads the returning
linemen. Not too much help
is expected from the sophoo,
mores,

Beloit: Because of Boloit's ab-
sence from recent conference
competition, the Buccaneers are
difficult to cvaluale. Hampercd
by iniurics and short on reserve
strength. last year's team com—
piled an unimpressivo 2~6 record

With seven men reporting for
opening practice and only is
on hand by the first weekend,
it looks as if Bcloit will again be

Most of the 1958 line, including
