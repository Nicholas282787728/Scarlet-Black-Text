A. Look At Our “Greener Grass" ‘

l
‘All too often in the case of the collegiate press, the two terms
“t itorial" and "slgned column" become synoinous with criticism,
to structive or otherwise, .
However there comes a time when the progressive move- l
iueul oi the institution in question can no longer be over looked. l

Ill the past 12 years the Younker halls, Louso hall, the science
buldlng and the new ll ary have been built, In anoll’let‘ 1WD
)‘tIil'sa the fine arts center and the new men's dorm will be com-
p etc .

N .t ycar Grinuell will introduce a new curriculum which
promises to he a great step toward a more complete, nieaiiingiul
education ior students, Eliminating short coverage ~oi deep sub-

3' . the, program will cover “'0 years, presenting the student
“1th a hroad picture oi the history oi mall’s thought and pro- -
gress and how that thought attracts the student's generation and
the generations to come.

Gt'inncll is one ot the two schools in the Midwest Conlercnce
~rc chapel attendance oi some sort is not compulsory. There
no school in the contei-anca which has as liberal an hours and

opsn house system as Gl‘lllllell's.

And there is, of course, no campus in the world which has
bean landscaped so quickly, so neatly, with sol many trees,

Any school the size of Grinnoll, which builds s major build-

Acid and Base ;

by John Sta '1 ' ‘

Once I thought there were
seven Fates m Hades, scvcn oldl
witches to control the lircs oil

mortals; but my iricnd i iss xl

there are actually eight. alldl
that it is they, not being able!

Stocking as it it would’
be worth the expense. At least
tor Greeks it was always the
same dog, and Cereherus was
impartially vicious to cvcrvonc.
That part of it was undel‘r
standablc. being not much dif-
ici-cut from what is accepted
practice at the house oi the
dead. but many ot the things
to ex-
plain wcrc almost impossible
for me to grasp in their subtle
contusion. One was extremely

by it. , -

who are destined by the Fates

Why has 2 given them
this power? Is it they who are
also responsible ior publiciz-
ing the works or the Fates

ing north campus-t It must be
someone of great skill. Does
the tail Mercury attend the
meetings oi the Fates, or is
there a tclcgraph wire strung
directly ircni the meeting
chamber to north caiupus'.l Be
sensible: We are or the Purie
tan tradition. Build a pillorr
or install a dunking stool.
That way iiortli campus will l
really have something tol
