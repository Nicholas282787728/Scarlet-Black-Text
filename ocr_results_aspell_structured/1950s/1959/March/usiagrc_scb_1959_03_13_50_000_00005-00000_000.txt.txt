Swimmers Win Mid-
Rack Up 69 Points; Win Five Events

by Dale Furnish
lGi'innell‘s hard—working swimmers last Saturday put
the finishing touch to a fine season by stroking to Victory
in the Midwest Conference swimming meet for the fifth
time in the last six years Coach Irv Simone’s athletes
splashed to five first places in ten events and. piled up 69
points to their nearest competitor, Knox, which had 50.

Three records were also
smashed by the Pioneers. The
relay team of Dick Bresnahan,
Art Johnson, Bob Grindey and
Buddy Frank covered 440 yds.
of medley relay in 4:142 to
break the existing mark by 4.7
seconds. Stan Norman account-
ed for the other two records as
he skimmed through a 29~second
ell-yd. freestyle and a 51.6-sec<
ond 100syd. freestyle, The lat—
ter time would have won the
Big Eight swimming meet held
rtxently and would have placed
high in the power—packed Big
Ten swim.

Bill Murray duplicated Nore
man’s double-win performance
when he brought home Grin-
nell viotories in the two dis-
tance freestyle events. Sec»
ond places were earned by the
ion-yd, freestyle relay team,
by Bresnahan in diving, and
by Jack Eiel, who finished
behind Murray in zhe zzo-yd.
freestyle.

Backstroker Art Johnson was
upset by two men he had beat-
en earlier in the season, but
still managed a third place in
his event. Grindey took an»
other third in the zoo-ydhreast
stroke. Fourth place points were
picked up'by Jim Jacobson in
the butterﬂy, Bill Hendrey in
the backstroke, and Pete Lysne
twice—in the so and loo-yd.
freestyles. Eiel garnered Grin-
nell‘s tinal points when he took
a iizth in the «bio—yd. freestyle.

The victory came as no sur~
prise to Grinnell swimming
fans. They have seen their
tankers wmpete in 10 dual
triangular and quadrangular

re gular season swimming
meets and come back with only

 

West Conference;

one loss—to Nebraska of the

Big Eight.

Pioneer tankers have literal-
ly torn apart the record book
all season. Such men as Nor-
man, Johnson, Murray, Grindey,
and Jacobson have lowered
various pool, meet and tank
marks wherever they have
swum. The relay teams have
also clipped seconds off exist—
ing statistics throughout Lhel
campaign.

Conch Simone brings out the
excellence of the team that
represents Grinnell in the 1
water by pointing out thatl
during a trip to Florin over i
Christmas vacation his men !
had no trouble holding their
own against the best swim-
mers from a majority or uni-
versities throughout the coun»
try. Further, Simone, though
not given to imprudent or .
superlative statements, wastes
no words when he dubs his
squad “the best Simon-pure
small college team in the
United Stales."By ”Simon-pure
he meuns non-subsidized.

simono sees no immediate end
to the winning tradition on this
campus. He says he will have a
”representative” team next year
after losing only Bresnahan, Grin-
dey and captain Jacobson from
this year‘s squad. The freshman
team won its conference meet
and is strong in almost every
event, so the needed replace-
ments should be forthcoming.
