The Gl‘ll‘mell varsity wrest-
ling team has been working
out for the last two weeks
under the direction of Coach
lBob Peterson. The football
injury of captain Roy Simp-
soll- has cost the team the
services of its most exper-
ienced grapplel'.

Bill Patton and Tony Gray
are thus the only two return-
ing lettermrn available. Juniors

Dave Manley and Tom Bullwin-
kle are also back ll‘om last
year.

Chances for a suotessful

season will probably depend
on the sophomores. Up from
last year‘s freshman learn are
Jerry Born, Dick lInrris.
Bruce Robinson and Carl Bis-
gard. In addition, John l-lnr—
tung, Rim Don and George
Hejna are three sophomores
out this year who did not
wrestle last year. Karl
Krumcl, a senior, is also out
for his first year of wrestling.

Simpson's availability for the
cntirc season is in doubt. He
was expected to be onc of tho»
loading scorers this year. and
his loss will hurt tho. tcam. Last
year, hc took third place in
