Harding said Thursday, “Several
men students have approached
me recently in connection with
the judging oi the Homecoming

halls also . said they thought
Clark should have won first
place," said Harding.

This selectivity will work to
everyones advantage Take the
story “A Day-Long Beard"
There is no doubt that it is
basically an excellent story. Had
you gone to the author and talk-
e'd it over with him, helped re-
phrase the objectionable pas-
. sages in a more refined man-
ner and given him careful
criticism; everyone concerned
would have been far better oft.

Literature is written by a
minority but it is for the ma—
jority. The majority deserves
the best and it's up to you to
give it to them,

Why do more college

men and w0men smoke

VICEROYS

than any other
ﬁlter cigarette?

Because only Viceroy
gives you 20,000 ﬁlter traps
in every ﬁlter tip, made
from a pure natural substance
— cellulose — found in delicious
fruits and other edibles.’

Yes, only Viceroy hae‘ihis hlter composed of 20,000 tiny
. ﬁlter traps. You cannot obtain the same ﬁltering action

The Viceroy ﬁlter wasn‘t just whipped up and rushed to
market to meet the new and skyrocketing demand {or ﬁl-
tered cigarettes. Viceroy pioneered. Started research more
than 20 years ago to create the pure and perfect ﬁlter.

Smokers en masse report that ﬁltered Viceroys have n
. ﬁner ﬂavor even than cigarettes without ﬁlters. Rich;
yet pleasantly mild.

Viceroy draws so easily that you wouldn’t know, without

only a penny or two more than cigarettes without ﬁlters!

and Viceroys cost

That’s why more college men and women smoke VICEROYS than

. that’s why VICEROY is the largest-
selling ﬁlter cigarette in the world!
