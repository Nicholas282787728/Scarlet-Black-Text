fCARLET AND BLACK

Friday. February 3, I950

 

Sp lashers on Roacl
For Mee’r Sa’rurday
Agains’r Good GAY

Tomorrow the Pioneer mermen:
wiu be striving tor a 500 mark
in dual meet competition as theyl
journey to St. Peter, Minn, to
oppose Gustavus Adolphus, a
tank team that should prove as1
strong as any the Scarlet anvil
Black has faced to date. Lastl
year's match between the two
teams ended in a 33-33 tie.

Grinnell, taking a traveling
team of only ten men, may be
without the valuable services of
Bill Frank, the Pioneers‘ best
backstroker and key man in the
300 yard medley relay. Frank
sustained an elbow injury earlierl
this week. In such a case Bab
Risse, regular in styler will
sub for Frank in the bacls-troke.

Expects Good Performance

Coach Bob Slaughter is ex—
pecting the usual fine pertorm.
ances from record busting Jack
Edgren, Doc Nielsen, Bob Risse,
and diver Clark Kingery. Jack
Edgren. who has set three new
pool marks thus for this season,
will be out to extend his one
record per meet streak.

Harris, the Gusies triple
threat, will be Grinnell’s big
headache tomorrow. Harris
swims breast stroke, back stroke
and free style, and is capable
of setting a record in any one,
of the three events. .

Adolphus posted a one-polm‘l
victory over Carleton two weeks
ago, while Grinnell lost to the
Carls by a narrow two points.
