This Is a NE WSpaper I

The letters this week indicate we did not make clear
our editorial stand on the content of the Scarlet and Black
last week.

Dl‘, Kuntz suggested that the S&B give more space to
intellectual discussion. We feel he has made a good sugges-
tion and will .try to follow it. However, the topics will be of
current campus interest, and they will be discussed by peo-
ple with a degree of authoritative knowledge on them.

Since the S&B is a news—paper, printing of anything
other than news is a sideline When the paper is small and
the amount of news, large, there is no room for discussions.
Since the paper is distributed on Fridays, it is seldom that
a performance done a week before is still of interest. How-
ever, it is unfair to review plays, etc., early on the basis
of rehearsals only.

Sports coverage has been berated by the recent letter
writers. Sports occupy only one-fourth the space of most
issues. According to a campus journalism survey made last
year, one-half the students read sports coverage regularly.
Probably another fourth read certain parts of the sports
pages. In view of the interest in this type of legitimate news,
sports should certainly be given no less space than at pres-
en .

The implication that multitudes of good writers are
anxious to contribute authoritative discussion articles is
not true. The two professors we asked to write philosophi-
cal reviews of ,“The Flies" for this paper were unable to do
so, During the fall political coverage we had difficulty find—
ing people willing to contribute to a minimal discussion.
Because of this unwillingness we'were unable to give the

extensive coverage we Ielt was merited.

Last week’s production of
“The Flies“ instigated a col-

and Existentialism that was
one or the best of the year. I

And the codes is good, too.

If you went to see “The Flies”
you probably saw, on the back
of the program. a list of “high-
lights" of the “Fine Arts Fess

To the Editor:

After having read your edi-
torial lzlst week “On Intellectual
Comment," 1 frankly did not
know what you were trying to
say. Were you taking a stand
against intellectual comment, or
for lt? Or were you just trying
to avoid a stand entirely? It
seems to me that the latter pol-
icy is one of the deadliest thlngs
a newspaper can do—deadly, that
is, for a paper that doesn’t have
a monopoly in its field.

You admlttcd it’s your policy
to print “thoughtful commen—
tzlry on subjects related to time-
ly topics of interest." You also
mentioned, in parentheses. that
the policy ls used infrequently.
As far as I can see, with the pass
sible exception of Thompson's
column, this kind oi commons
my hardly appears at all 1 use
the word "hardly” because I
don't claim to read the SdzB all
the way through all the time I
don’t have to. I pay strict at-
Ientlon in house meeting and
really study those noon ans
nouncements. '

What do you consider to be
timely topics? Last week a
great part of chi: campus was
agcg over Jean-Paul Sartre's
philosophy of life. it crowded
into class discussions, drew a
packed coffee hour, and filled
the ARH auditorium both nights.
People seemed interested. And
what reflection of this do we
find in the 5&5? One paragraph,

To the Editor:

I joln Bob Barr in a cheer for
Dr Kuntz and anyone else who
rs lntel‘csted in broadening the
scope of newspaper discussion
arncles. We at Grlnnell hope we
are being educated in a way
that will,make us capable of
thinking for ourselves. The ed-
ucational facilities here are sup-
posed to develop hur «n think-
mg and evaluate abilities and
provide areas of interest back-
ground for further thought and
study. it is not the job of the
"more capalble counselors" to
guide our thinking, lbut to stim-
ulate it.

The 58:13 could be an excel-
lent source of stimulus and out
let for student expression on
matters of campus and national
interest, The Wednesday chapel
series, for example, should pro-
voke both lnteresting and valus

articles. The s&B need not com—
mit itself editorially; (here are
plenty of students and faculty

Grinnell.

Perhaps the sports sections
would not suffer by being made
a little more succint and a
little less sprawling to provide
space for such material. Here's
hoping the 5&B doesn’t try to
squelch sny creative thinking at
Grinnell!
