Monday Night

Monday night started off prepping with a lot more
gusto than was expected. As we see it there can only be
one explanation for it. Last year’s prepping rules included
the statement tllat at Monday housemeetings during the
prep season each prep was allowed three swats with a pine
paddle.

The new prepping rules say that only on the night
of informal initiation can a prep be swatted and then only
five times. Many if not most of the upperclassmen felt that
this was an integral part of the program However this is
not the argument now. Now we are going to try to explain
some of the upperclassmen’s present actions.

When they heard of these new rllles they were dis-
satisfied. Therefore, in last Monday’s housemeetings
many of them took it out on the preps. Strange as it
seems they were able to find loopholes in the rules. They
could have found them last year also, but felt content
with the rules and tried to stick within them.

We think now however, that the halls realize that
they have overplayed their hands. It is now just a mat-
ter of correcting our mistakes and giving the preps a
program, possibly just as tough, but aimed more at build-
ing them up than tearing them down.

More Than A Band

A story on page 3 of this paper says that the band
needs 15 new members. Doesn’t that sound familiar?

It seems to us that one of the most appropriate sym~
bols of high spirits, enthusiasm and morale in a college is
a colorful marching band. Grinnell was indeed fortunate
t gain the services of Charles L. Luckenbill, a man of no

drill enthusiasm himself, who immediately proposed the
mation here.

It seems pitful that a band —— the very symbol
of morale ~ should be treated with the usual gulf of stu-
dent apathy that has washed out so many other projects.

And thirdly, it seems to us that the newly-avowed
attempts on the part of faculty and administration to in-
spire morale will fall by the all-too«familiar wayside with-
out active student support.

And finally, there’s no escape to be gained by claiming
a lack of musical talent at Grinnell. Monday‘s Quad
“serenade” audibly disproved that

The Sound
and
The Fury

by Art Ticvcis

In the commencement is-
sue I tricd to explain, in a
rather condensed fashion,
exactly where I stood. Be-
cause only a few students
saw that issue, and because
1 wish to avoid being known
as "The Man Who Hates
Grinnell”; I should like to
make my position clear at
this time.

I am here primarily to get
an education, and. i have no
complaints regarding the aca-
demiu side mi Gl'innell. in fact
it would be uiiiicult, if not
impossible, to iiml so dis-
tinguisllcd and erudite a faculty
at any other school of com-
parable size. The high rating
accorded Grimlell speaks out
ini- more eloquently than 1.
Why then the vitriol?

As far as the food is concerm
ed, 1 am fairly well satisfied.
There are countless problems
connected with cooking for 875

persons, i realize. Cal-cam dishes, .

however, set me back on my
heels. I will never stop wond-
cnng about the process used to
boil eggs inside out. So many
mornings l have broken my egg
and watched the albumin flow
to the edge of the plate, while
the yolk sits there, a hard gold-
en sphere and dares me to get,
a fork. into it. Certain othei“

delicacies are not chly unpalaei

able but illogical; notalbly ham!
and egg pic, cherry fritters, and
the notorious french fried cauli-
flower. But the meals are hot,
and clean, and for the most p‘artl
hummus. l

I wouldn’t wish to give the l.
impression that] thought the
men of Buildings and Grounds I
were morons. They do their '
job as well as any of us. it's
just that when you upon
an irregularity, you expect
and deserve fast results. We
reported the difficulty with
the water five times before
anything was done. While we
were waiting it became so
bad um mu: best friends were
telling us, and the more mol-
hardy of our number were
dancing Spanish Fandangos l
around the lwaslu'oom after an
attempt to shower. .1

Certain other incidents about
the campus strike me as funny.
For example, dance intramural
seems like a farce to me, (No
aesthetic quality, probably.)|
Certain of. the women’s regula-l
tlcyus seem peculiar. thoughl
some seem to be excellent. ‘

What all this is getting at is
simply this. It is a fine lhmgl
to be able to laugh at yourselil
occasionally. II I can help you,
do that then I will consider this
column a success.
