Seek Firsl' Division in Loop

The St. Olaf Oles move into Darby tomorrow night as

the Pioneer llai‘dwoodel's
Midwest conference victory

strive for their tltlld straight
and an upper division berth.

S‘t‘. Olal"s wellebalanced attack and rebounding Strength

accounted for a 90-77 Pioneer

between the two at Northfield,
Minn, but Coach John Pfitsch

, looks for a much closer tussle

this time.
Chance to Advance

The Oles stand sixth in the
conference now, only one-half
game better than Grinnell so
that a Grinnell win would auto—
matically boost the squad into
sixth.

Ole coach Mark Almli has no

outstanding point—maker but
has three start rs averaging

WHAT’S THIS? For solution see paragraph below.

IT‘S EASY 10 SEE that the Droodle above is titled:
Tired anthropologist relaxing with betber-tasting Lucky
behind freshly dug-up fossil. No bones about it, Luckies
taste better to all sorts of people. College smokers,
for instance, prefer Luckies in all other brands, ao-
‘ cording to the latest, greatest coast—to-coastest college
survey. Again, the No. 1 reason for Luckies’ wide lead:
Luckies taste better. They taste better,
ﬁrst of all, because Lucky Strike means
fine tobacco. Then, that tobacco is
toasted to taste better. “It’s Toasted"—
the famous Lucky Strike process~tones
up Luckies’ light, good-tasting tobacco
to make it taste even better. . . cleaner,
fresher, smoother. So, enjoy the better-
tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
