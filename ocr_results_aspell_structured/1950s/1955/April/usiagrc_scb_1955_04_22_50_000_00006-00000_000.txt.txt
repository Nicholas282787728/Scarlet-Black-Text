roles in those plays have been
challenging, but tor the reason
that many at Grinnell’s actors
have not been able to meet the
challenge. not an unnatural
phenomenon, the productions
have been spotty with many
weal; spots and a few really fine
moments.

Can the Grinnell theatre
with its high educational
aims ever present productions
that will please and entertain
a critical audience? Yes, but
it will take time: time to eti-
ucate the new underclass ric-
tors and time to educate the
audience.

Gone, 1 hope for good, are
the days or Rope and Portrait
in Black, old turkeys good
enough, I am sorry to say, for
the country’s community the-
atres.

With the start that has been
made this year by the Grinnell
Players I don’t, think it will be
too many years before Grinnell
audiences will howl and tremble
at top—notch performances of
The Misanthrope and Othello. I
wish I were going to be around
to see it.

The first two—thirds of Tonight
At 8:30 is a bore. Taken singly,
the third ploy on the evening’s
program, Fumed Oak, is prob-
ably the best and most fully
realized of the Player produm

you'll have to sit through Ways
And Means and Red Peppers to
see it.

hara Jenkins and Nancy
Dopps, know exactly the parts
they are supposed to play and
they play them well. This
cannot be said oi most oi the
actors in the iirst two plays,
and it is not entirely their
fault because they do not
really have roles they can
play.

All three plays were origin-
ally written as vehicles for Noel
Coward and Gertrude Lawrence.
In the iii-st two plays the lead
actors are playing not the roles
of the characters in the plays,
but the roles of Coward and
Lawrence.

The main reason tor the
success of Fumed Oak is that
it is the only play of the
bunch, the only one that can
be originally acted, Ways and
Means and [ted Peppers re.
main vehicles.

I think better plays or groups
oi plays could have been chosen
for the spring theatre produc—
tion. For. excluding Fumed Oak,
the Coward one acts do not

offer the student actors anything
to work with. The roles would
