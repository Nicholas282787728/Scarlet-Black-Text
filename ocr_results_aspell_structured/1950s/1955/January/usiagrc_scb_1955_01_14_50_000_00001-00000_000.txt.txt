Grim-tell College, Grinnell, Iowa, January I4. I95;

Registration Starts Next Week; 5 C Hopes For

Juniors, Seniors

Register First

Presregistration for next semester will be four days,
January 18 to 21, with seniors and juniors being given
preference, Miss Bethana McCandless, Registrar, announced

Tuesday.

Seniors and juniors will register Tuesday, Jan. 18, and
sophomores will register the following day. The first half
of the freshmen, with names beginning with letters from

A through L will sign up for
classes Thursday, Jan. 20. Reg-
istration for freshmen with
names beginning with letters M
through 2 will be the Friday
of that week.

Hours for registration will be
from 9 a.n1, to 12 noon, and
irom 1:15 p.m. to 4 pm.

The new system was devised
as an improvement ~on last
year‘s, said Miss McCandless
adding that she thought it prob-
ably would be ”a little easier."
Preference, she felt, should'be
given to the seniors and jump
iors, who are required to take
certain classes before they leave.
while the freshmen have ”lots
of time left" to do it in.

The system used last year, an
alphabetical method in which
every fourth letter was assignv
ed to the same day, aroused
much protest‘ from the students
standing in line on the last two
days and brought an official ob-
iection from the Student Coune
cil and the Scarlet and Black.
The delay was attributed to
lack of faculty staff.

Section changes in A and B
level language and English
‘courses will be permitted only
when and if vacancies occur.
In this Way, freshmen register-
ing on the last day will be able
to retain their places in their
present classes.

Two new courses being offerv
ed this semester are Economic
mstor-y of the United states,

either History or Economics
C48, which will be taught by
Kenyon A. Knopf in Group 1,
and Politics and Government in
the Middle East, Pol, Sci. cza,

which Joseph Dunner will cons
duct in Group 7.

Prospective candidates for
campus offices should make
sure that they/are eligible u
der the existing rules. Quali
cations for holding office are
completion of 76 hours of work,
a grade point of 2.00, and come
pletion of all the basic re—
quirements for graduation, cur-
rent registration to meet them

or permission of the Personnel,

Board for postponement. The
basic requirements include B,C.,
A.C. or equivalent, at least one
year of foreign language, health
education, physical education,
and for men, Basic Air Science.

Juniors were reminded by the
Registrar that the course in
A.C, or its alternatives must be
completed by the end of their
third year.

All students, whether they
have payed their fees or not.
must come to the women’s gym
on January 22 between the
hours of 8:15 and ii, and bear
tween 1 and 4. Class cards will
be approved, fees assessed, and
activity and meal tickets dis
tributed. Students who do not
follow this procedure will be
penalized by a $5 late registtras
tion fee.

Several Students Mentioned

ﬁts Candidate's

By Art Travels

'For SC Prexy

. In view of the fact that the convention in Darby Gym—
nasxum to determine the candidates for Student Council
president has been moved forward to February (old date:
,March) ‘lt would perhaps not go amiss to make some pre-
conventlon predictions as to who will be running.

in accordance with such a
maneuver, several of the more
prominent oracles about the
campus political scene were
asked to do a little premature
divining. Most were, at the out—
set, a bit reticent, however a
small but carefully planned
amount of coaxing restored their
faith in their clairvoyance.

01 names mentioned for ser-

ions candidacy there were

several Tom 1309, the present

informal social chairman;

George Drake, last year’s

sophomore class president; Don

Cassiday, the current junior

class president; Chuck Haynes.

literary editor of the sell;
nave Quast; and Ken Kasse-
baum, who was class president
during the freshman year, and

Jim Stewart, sctlvein dramat—

ics, and Sec'y of snx.

Cassiday, however, says, “I'm
not running. I'm getting mar.
ried this summer." perhaps these
two positions are mutually in»
compatible. 1 fear a power he-
hind the throne.

Among the fair sex there were
four candidates mentioned: Del-
la Narcisi, Mary Jane poyter,
Ginnie Rhoads, and Nancy Nor-
ris. it was further predicted that
the last three girls would not
run against each other, indicat
ing perhaps a caucus of three to.

When asked, Miss Poynter de»
nied any intention of running on

her part or on the part of the
pick the candidate.
others. ,

in the field of ”jag" cam.
paigning, several other names
were brought forth. whether
those men change their minds
and develop into serious candi-
dates is a topic for specula-
lation. These are Jim Stewart,
Bob Holmes, and Joseph “KiL
ler“ Kogen. Holmes is the pre
sent North Campus social
chairman,

Holmes denied any intention
of running. chen could not be
reached for a statement.

From a non~ political source,
comes the name of Bob Dick~
enson, former candidate for jun-
havc its implications despite the
ior class president. This may
nature of the source as Dicken—
son is well known as an inde
pendent and therefore may pass
the notice of the more veteran
members of the political scene.

Which two will emerge from
the convention on top, of course,
is anybody’s guess. Even the
seers would not prognosticate to
that extent. The only thing to
to do is polish your “Tiger” Han—
sen huttons, put a record oi
“Old Soldiers Never Die" on
the vic and wait.

Seat On Board

The student Council last night
received word of favorable udr
mlllistl‘atlon Comment on the
possibility of having student re-
presentation on the Personnel
Board.

No formal reply has been re
ceived to a Student Council
letter asking for representation.

The council suggested that
three students be permitted to
Sit in on the board‘s meetings.
Ihe presidents of the Student
Council, League Board, and the
c of HP would be nonrvotlng
members.

They would attend all meet-
ings dcvoted to issues involving
the student body. They would
not, however, be present at dis-
cussions involving individual
students,

The proposal is an attempt to
give students greater voice in
matters pertaining to the whole
student body~ and to improve
communication between the fac»
ulty, the administration, and the
students. .

Although the student repre-
sentatives would have no vote,
they would be able to relay
student opinion on matters like
the controversies over Thanks-
givmg vacations.

WRA To Present
Dance IM Tonight

The annual dance Intramural
will be held tonight at 8 pm.
in Darby gymnasi in. Over 300
women will participate in the
WRA sponsored event.

Competing for the dance ins
tramural trophy, now held by
Halnes hall, each hall will pre-
sent interpretative dances based
around a central theme. Themes
for the various hall dances were
chosen before the holiday vaca—
lion.

Main chose “Holiday of.
Moods”, foul- dances combining
moods and colors. Cleveland‘s
“Symphony in Blue" is a study
of four moods done in blue.

James’ theme “Winter Won-
derland” includes various phases
of well-known winter scenes.

“It Pays To Advertise”. the
title of Haines’ choice, consists
of tour perfume ads. The set-
ting for Read's dance is in a rec.
ord shop, where dances and
costumes will be done according
to four record titles. The story
of the Western frontier will be
interpreted in dance by Loose.

The dance intramural was first
promoted at Grinnell by Clara
Julia Andersen, professor emer-
itus of the college, to stimulate
interest in dance among the stu-
dents. The first intramural
dance program was held in 1943.

All participating halls will ac-
cumulate points toward the An-
dersen trophy which is awarded
at the end of the year to the
women‘s hall receiving the most
points in intramural activities.

Judging will be on the ba-
sis of theme and composition,
dance technique, costuming,
and music and accompaniment.

Judges for the event will. ‘be
George Lovell (psychology), E1-
bert Smith (modern foreign
languages), Miss Beth Noble
(modern foreign languages), Mrs.
Jane Harnack (women’s physical
education) and Mrs. John Bur-
ma, wife of John Burma (soci-
olcgy).

chairmen are Main, Ginny Oku-
bo; Cleveland, Jeanne Ware;
James, Jane Walsh and Carolyn
Hewes; Haines, Judy Reget and
Barb ‘Farries; Read, Joy Arm-
strong, Helen Yates and Cece

Three Dibble Men
Expelled Today
By Personnel Board

Two Dibble juniors and a
Dibble freshman were dismissed
from the college today for be-
ing responsible for the flag in»
cident at the Dec, 11 game.
(A piece of material was hung
over the flag bearing a remark
abusive to Dean of Men Henry
A. Brown; the act of decorating
the national flag is a misdes
meanor punishable by law.)

The men concerned confessed
to the Personnel Board this
morning, after which the Per-
sonnel Board decided to make
their dismissal effective im-
meditely to be executed by the
president. They will be allowed
to take their final examinations
the autumn if they are in good
in absentia, and to return in
academic standing at this time,
(The two iuniors are on ac—
ademic probation.)

On Monday the men confess
ed to the C of HP and the c
of HP made the following rec
ommendations to Acting Presi~
dent Rupert A. Hawk.

1. that the men be suspended
for three weeks;

2. that they be put on social
probation until spring vacation.

3. that they be put on con.
duct probation for the remain.
der of the year.

Hawk returned the recom-
mendation for reconsideration.
The c of HP decided that the
case was an institutional matter
and the concern of the adminis-
tration.

Hawk said, “The c of HP did
a very good job in working on
this. They are over the twilight
zone where they have to feel

These decisions were reached
following a report by a commit-
tee appointed to study finances.
The committee found it impera-
tive that the business accounts
of student publications be clear-
ed and closed while business
managers of the publications
still have student status.

The decision to elect only
juniors to the Cyclone positions
was based on the fact that since
the Cyclone covers the activ»
ities of an academic year, it
could not operate on a semes-v
ter plan such as the new 5&3
plan.

Students interested in the
positions of editor and business
manager of the Cyclone and
who will have junior standing
next year are invited to submit
applications. Cyclone salaries
are $350.00 for the year.

The Scarlet and Black staff
head applicants will serve as
special assistants next semester.
They will assume full duties in
the fall and serve until the end
of the first semester of the
next year. Because of the
change to a new system of
tenure, the Board moved to con»
sider payment for time spent
in training in addition to time
spent in office. The students
will be paid according to ser—
vices rendered up to the maxi.
mum of 3400.

Special assistants will be
chosen next fall to he staff
heads for the second semester
of the next year and the first
semester of the following year.

Applications should be sub“
mitted to Kenyon Knopf, chair».
man of the Board, and are due
on or before noon, February 2.

Applicants should state their
academic and extra curricular
records, relate their past ex
perience in this field and their
reasons for applying for the
positions. After the applications
have been reviewed the candi-
dates will he interviewed by
the Board.

Further clarification of the
new policy or information re»
garding the positions may be
obtained from Nancy Oates,
S&B editor; Jerry Tomlinson,
5&3 business manager; Ken
Kuntz, Cyclone editor; and Ed
i-lo, Cyclone business manager.
