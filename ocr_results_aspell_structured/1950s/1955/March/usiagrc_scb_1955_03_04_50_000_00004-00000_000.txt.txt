Hoopslers Topple

Monmouth; Oles

‘Tﬁe Pioneer cage squad ﬁn-
ished the 1954—55 home season
on a raounding note lily tak-
ing hard fought contests from
Monmouth and St. Olaf. Last
Saturday night the Scots fell
79-76 and Monday St. Olaf he-
came Grinnell’s fourth straight
conference Victim by a 69-67
score.

MoDmouLh’S out-shooting kept
the Pioneers in check until the
third quarter when 14 straight
markers gave the home forces a
59-50 lead. Previous to this
point the Scots had held leads
up to nine points and led at
the half 42-35.

The Scarlet ﬁve increased the
margin to 12 points before a
final Monmouth drive iust fell
short of catching the Grinnell-
ians. Free throws by Larry
Koch and John Musser supplied
the winning margin.

Dick Crawl and John Musser
wound up as high scorers with
24 Counters apiece.

The pioneers and Oles floun-
dered around for the first ten
minutes before either team
could get up anything resemb—
ling an oﬁense in Monday's can
test. Scoring 20 of their last 28
points in the first half on free
throws Grinnell forged to a
37-29 intermission lead.

Some sharpshooting by St.
Olaf early in the second half
enabled them to gain a mo-
mentary rour point lead at 53»
49 but Dick Crowl led a Pio-
neer counterattack which was
enough to stop the visitors.

Top P i o n ee r point~getters
were Dick Crowl and John Mus-
ser with 24 and la markers re.

champs. These are

undefeated the last two years,

Rounding out the Grinnell

lineup will be John Bohannon at

age at 157, and Wills Davidson‘

in the l77dpound class.

The Knox Siweshers, who
rated a third in last year’s cone
fab, boast seven victories in as
many starts this season and are
favored to succeed the ,hame
team Grinnellians in the coveted
second spot

Knox’s outstanding individual
is 123—pounder Jim Jones who
won last year’s loo—pound title
Other good bets are 1311 Dick
Gappen, 167-pounder Homer
Johnson, and heavyweight Pete
Hosutt.

Ripon Given Chance

Leading the Ripon Redmen
into action will be Bill lhssen,
a fourth finisher at lil’ﬂpounds
in the loop in 1954. Also vying
for a top spot are lG7-pounder
Gail White and light-heavy
weight Hal Anderson

Lawrence, the only loop team
which Grinncll did not wrestle
in the regular season, may lbe a
surprise since several lettermen
gained eligibility at semesters.
Coach Bernie Heselton’s solo
hopes are Chuck Capetta and
Dick Beringcr. Capetta was third
at 137 and Beringer iourth at
123 in 1954 The Vikings lost to
Ripon in a dual.

Cal-ls Hiunpered

Carleton was seriously hurt
recently when Pete Samuels, ace
167-pound grapplcr. was forced
to quit. The Chris were trouné-
ed by Grinnell 26-8 and lost
their last meet to a supposedly
weak Coe contingent, but hold
a 20716 victory over St. Olaf.

Cue Has Rosenberg

The Kohawks' outstanding
grappler is sophomore 177-
pounder John Rosenberg who
has compiled a record of six
wins and one loss this season.
Dick Hughes at 123-pounds is a
threat in this class.

Determination of seedings and

very important factor for a
