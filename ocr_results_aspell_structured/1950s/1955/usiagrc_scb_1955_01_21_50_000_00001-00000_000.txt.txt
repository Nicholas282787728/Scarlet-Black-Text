Chief of Police Waldo Johnson
said Tuesday. The two juniors
were each fined $25 and the
freshman $10.

Chief Johnson pointed out that
under Iowa Code 32, the by:-
had committed a misdemisuiiir,
and were subject to fines up to
$100 each or 30 days in lair.
However, he said, it was dee

lecture from the judge would
be more effective in this case.

Johnson also emphasized the
fact that this case had no as
pects of a personal dispute with
either the college or town offi-
cials. In fact, he reported that
the boys had said they felt tdc
action taken against them was
“very fair," and ”a good ex—

In addition to the credit Act-

stated, “This was the best ex-

seen. The C of HP is certainly
to be commended."

Workshop Gives Inspired

Performance

Of ‘Medium"

The fault with Grinnell Audiences is that’most people
Wait until Friday to hear what their friends Say about the
Thursday night performance before attending a Show. Be-
cause of this, many people who would have Wished to see
“The Medium" are going to be left out in the cold, If there
is not a better house in ARH Auditorium tonight than last
night, it is El poor reflection on student taste.

GlanaCarlo Menottl is a
genius.“The Medium” is a
superb opera. The performance
given last night by the Opera
‘Workshop was inspired. The
audience was, I believe, more
profoundly moved by “The
Medium” than by any other
stage work in the last' four
years here.

Karen Kalin sang the role
of Baba, the Medium. I believe
her performance was one of the
finest one will ever see on the
Grinneil stage. This single role
is enough to convince me that
she is the finest actress on the
Grinneil stage at present. Per-
haps that isn't saying much.
Perhaps it would be more {it
ting to say I have seen no per-
formance on the local stage to
equal this one in four years.
Her work, however, was a trifle
uneven. for a reason which I
will point out later in terms of
the entire cast.

Marcia Madden, as Monica,
daughter of the Medium, also
does her best job to date. She
has managed to give a complete»
ly full and sincere performance,

throwing out entirely? the thedt»
riczllity and affection which
have hindered her in the past.

Scotty Walker, as Toby, the
mute, has perhaps the toughest

if anything, the cast is too
subjective in its approach to
the opera. Madden and Kalin
have at times difficulty in
achieving complete control of
themselves, This, it appears to
me, is unavoiable. The emotion—
al impact of “The Medium"
puts almost too great a deamnd

The amount of credit to be

SC Proposal '

For Thanksgiving Weekend

Faculty members last Monday turned down Student
requests for a four—day Thanksgiving vacation. The faculty
approved the. school calendar for 1955-56 with only a one-
day Thanksglvmg holiday following considerable discussion

of the matter.

Satirical Numbers
In Dance Concert

_lva Kitchell, dance satirist,
will present the second program
in the concert series, at the
high school auditorium on Mon-
day, Jan. 31, at s p, in.

Miss Kitchen, assisted by Har-
vey Brown, composeraaccom-
panist, satirizes everything from
ballet to character dancing, Una
like many comic dancers, she is
in good control of technique, so
that she can dance as ‘well as
the people she spoofs.

Admission to the concert will
be by activity ticket.

Born in Kansas, Miss Kitchell
was a member of the Chicago
Opera Ballet and toured with a
Russian Ballet troupe. Then she
began seeing things which to
her were too silly and absurd not
to he laughed at. She began her
career of making fun of people

on Spanish dancers,

One of the most remarkable
features of her performance is
her ability to change from one
character to another in a few
seconds. She switches from
coloratura soprano to modern
dancer to housewife trying on

change a scarf.

Miss Kitchell's tours of the
United States, Canada and South
America have won her many
“rave” reviews.

Haynes has left the unresolved
questions unresolved, bringing
only his fine sense of theater
to the opera and sharing it with
his performers. The only point
where one might take issue with
him is his set. It is somewhat
obtrusive, which a good set
should not be.

It is about time someone said
a word about Shirley Speel—

The Student Council. after
polling student opinion, had
recommended that the Thanks»
giving vacation be increased
from a oneeday holiday to in-
clude Friday and Saturday fol—
lowing Thanksgiving. Acting
Dean of the College Homer Nor.
ton said that a statement will
be released giving reasons for
the faculty decision in time for
publication in the next issue of
the S&B.

When questioncol about the
faculty decision. Dean Brown
said that faculty members tend
to disapprove of the extended
vacation because they feel it
wouid lower academic Standards
by cutting down on the number
of class meetings.

To avoid this, school would
have to start earlier or continue
later, which would add to the
institutional costs. other alter-
natives would call for students
to give up victory day, spring
day, or a portion of Christmas
or spring vacation.

When contacted early in the
week about the faculty action,
Student Council President Kit»
ten Arveson aid she felt that
"the studen have been by
passed."

The Council last night decided
to question students again on
several a rnatives that», they
might favor. The results of the

,votes .will be given to the Inter,

ulty in hope that they will re—
consider their decision.

Students at houscmeetings are
going to vote on whether they
would want to give up victory
day and one day of spring va-
cation or else two days of Christ—
mas vacation in exchange for
the four-day Thanksgiving vaca—
tion.

The beginning of Christmas
vacation could be delayed from
Saturday, December 18 to Tues-
day, December 21.

At the Monday meeting facul~
ty members expressed the opin—
ion that these proposals would
not be acceptable to students.

According to Kitten, one of
the objections to a Thanksgiving
vacation is that a large number
of students would not be able
to leave the campus for the
weekend. She explained, how-
ever, that only about 100 stu-
dents live outside of easy travel
distance from Grinneil.

Council members are planning
to tabulate the number of stu-
dents who would go home if
there was a fou day vacation.
