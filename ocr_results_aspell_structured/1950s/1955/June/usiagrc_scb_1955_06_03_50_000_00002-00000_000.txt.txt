Good News

A quiet year is a bad olle from the journalist’s view-

point. The public taste alld newspaper that serves it have
been conditioned to tlle attitude that good news is bad
reading. Be that as it may, we are glad that the SSLB has
had the good fortune to carry so much good news.
‘ 1954-55 was not the year of the Single Cause. The
'constitntion for student government lay in a file awaiting
the selection of a new president of the college as was in,
evitable and wise. The long controv 'sial drinking rule was
clearly stated and very capably enforced by the C of HP
and League Board. With these big problems of many years
off the agenda, it seemed for a while as if the vital critical
character of the student body lay fallow.

Criticism does not mean complaint. It means caring
enough about something to find the flaws, study them,
bring them to the attention of those who can do something
about them, and then helpillg to do what can be done.

Subject to this sort of criticism was Thanksgiving
vacation. It is to be hoped that next year’s students will
remember the lesson gleaned from this questio : that after
months of haggling with faculty and administration, a sur~
rey revealed the face-reddening fact that not enough stu-
dents wanted the vacation, under the ollly conditions pos-
sible, to warrant further discussion.

Another problem was prepping Cr sm in this case
took the form of letters, surveys, columns, and editorials

and ultimately a new prepping program was worked out
by the C of HP and Dean of Men Hank Brown Prepping can
either emphasize the feeling of being a freshman, and thus
prolong adolescence, or it can promote the feeling of being
a college student and thus encourage maturity and respon»
sibill y. \Vc're for for the latter.

Though student representation has decreased on some
committees (nombly the Committee on Student Publica-
tions), the students now, through the student council, dis,
tribute the student activities portion of the sem fee. Still
more important is the occasional advisory capacity of the
SC, C of II , nld Ill? pre\ is to the Committee on Academic
Standing (formerly the Pe sonnel Board).

It would enl as if there was an increased interest in
academic a' a The Friars and Mortar Board coffee hours,
cel ainly‘one of the finest informal academic experiences
available to the students, were extremely well attended.
Attendance at the Gates Lectures was astounding, and stilli-
ulated seleral days discussion and argument. The suggc.
tion of a study week or weekend prior to filial examinations
was well received by both faculty and student , though no
action was taken on the propo ll. The raising of the re-
quirement for Dean’s List was vehemently protested and
a more relaxed cut system was strongly recommended.

The ll) 55 Scarlet and Black, composed of some
twenty-tire students, suggested and supported such ideas.
In addition to serving as communications between student,
faculty and administrative groups, we have tried to bring
you features by and about outstanding students and t'acul-
ty members, r iews of current literary, art music, drav
matlc, and pol a1 events, and special editions such as
the Homecoming Anniversary Edition and SC Election

Edition and the Extra about President-elect Howard R.
Bowen.

In this 60th year of publication of the “Oldest College
Newspaper West of the Mississippi River", the 5&3 hopes
that the old adage proved wrong, and that good news meant
good reading for you.

good reading. NKO

From The President

TO THE STUDENTS 0F GRINNELL COLLEGE:

From nly point of view, at least, this has been a very
interesting year. Now that I can look back upon it in
retrospect I, like you, can make several observations. There
was much that I had planned to do that I didn't get done
There was mucll that I would like to have dolle, but I didn’t
seem to get the time. Again, some of the things at which
I worked were unnecessary, unproductive and not particu‘
larly useful. I am sure that all of you have had similar

feelings
However, the greatest
thrill has been that of being

a working part of an on go—
ing institution. We all hope
that, in some small way, we
have contributed to the per—
petuity, the development and
the progress of that institu-
tion.

There is no doubt that the
life of each of you has been
greatly changed and affected
by having attended Grinnell

college. This experience will
be a continuing one. And, at
the same time, there is no
doubt but that the future of
Grinnell college will be af<
i'ected by your having been
a student here, This effect
will, also, be a continuing
one. And, what has happen-
ed to you has also.happened'
to me. In that regard our

experiences have been mutual.

One cannot Ilelp but approach a Commencement with
some feelings of nostalgia. Never, again, will just the
same group of people be gathered together. Never, again,
will just the same experiences and friendships and hopes
and aspirations be as possible and as important. So, in con-
clusion, let me say it has been an interesting and, at times,
a thrilling experience. Frankly, I am just as satisfied that
it is in my past rather than in my future. You have been
a fine group of individuals with which to work.

Yours sincerely,
RUPERT Al HAWK
ACTING-PRESIDENT
