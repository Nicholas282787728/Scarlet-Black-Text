outlook and hope, thanks to the change ill atmosphere. We
see a great future for Grinnell College and its present and
future students.

Each year the 5&3 states an editorial policy “hich it
will carry ,out through the year. We have set no definite
policy as we have yet to see some of the many colorful
changes which the new administration talks about. It will
take at least a year to make themselves really felt as there
is still a lot of red tape which must be out.

We were’invit’ed to the home of Dean Grace last Tues,
day and found that he had already sounded out the campus
and found many of its weak spots. These had already been
discussed orer and over again by those “in the know" and
no conclusion has ever been reached. Although no definite
answers were found, Dean Grace realized one thing, and
that is that the students need to band together for the spce
oiiic purpose of settling such questions Ally institution
that strives to be self improving must first of all be self
critical.

Student government played a prominent part in the
discu: ion. If there must be changes made, they must be
made by the students and hot by all administration or
faculty group.

The 5&3 hopes that it can play its role by letting the
campus know of rule changes, actions by the student g'ow
ernment, and by trying to explain the whys and where-
l'ores of the present rules and red tape which we have.

in the history of the College. .

All of the ingredients for a year of accon :lisllmei.. nr-

who represent all interesting Variety of talents and cal'eel
objectives. All have in common a dcmonst ted apt'
tilde for academic studies
and a firm commitment of
the ideals of Grinnell College.

The new class of 1959 is ,
nearly 800 strong and
promises to be one of the
most talented classes of re-
cent years.

Our faculty, as always, is '
of the highest quality, and
has recently been joined by
several outstanding new
members. Alfaculty member

The financial future of the
College seems more promis-
