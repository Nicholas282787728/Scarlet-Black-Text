Once Salvation

Army Officer;

Freshman Heads Rural Church

by Marv Olsen
Salvation Army officer in

charge of corps headquarters

in Oskeloosa, Dnbuque, and Watertown, SD, director of
Salvation Army youth settlement houses in Waterloo and

Des Moines, student minister

of the Methodist church in

Malcom, Iowa, and a psychology major at Grinnell; these

have been highlights in the
Garrington.

Dwight virtually grew up
With the Salvation Army; his
father worked withsit, and in
high school in Marshalltown he
decided he wanted to enter the
Army as an officer, or profes-
sional later. After working two
years following graduation from
high school, he entered the
Salvation Army Training college
in Chicago to take the ten
month course required of all
Army officers before they be-
gin work. This course deals
with handling and solving relig-
ious and social problems that
a corps leader is likely to be
faced with ,as well as specific
management technique. After
this the new officer is required
to work under a senior officer
for 18 months and to take cor-
respondence courses for five
years.

At the training college he
also met his future wife, who
was an officer in her own]
right before him. (The Salva- I
tion Army requires that all
wives of officers also attend
the training college), They
now have three children: a
boy six, a boy four, and a
girl one.

His first assignment was Oskz-
loosa, where he was in charge
of the corps headquarters in
that town. The work of the Sal-
vation Army, which maintains
such headquarters in almost all
towns, deals with the spiritual,
social, and psychological prob-
lems of under rivileged people.
Specific situations Dwight faced
in his work included transit and
homeless people, juvenile de-
linquents, and unwed mothers.

Work With Youth

After doing similar work in
Dubuque, the Garringtons
moved to Waterloo, Where the
two of them worked together
to open up i Salvation Army
youth settlement house to deal
more specifically with youth
problems. The center which
they developed provided such
things as recreation, arts and
critfts, physical education, and
dramatics for people from four
to 25, in addition to an adult
education program for young
married and senior groups.

His last two Army posts were
in Des Moines, where he again
directed a youth settlement
house, this time with a staff of
18 people under him, and in
Watertawn, S. D., where he was
in charge of the corps detach-
merit.

His Work ‘With the church}
which has about E0 members,
includes holding three services
a week H two on Sunday and
one Wednesday evening _ as
well as a youth service and
a choir rehearsal. In addition
to this and carrying a full
college load, he is also work.

career of freshman Dwight

ing about 14 hours a week as
a cashier in McNally’s food
store here in town.
Commutes Daily

when Dwight decided last
year to continue his education
in college, and after choosing to
return to Iowa since this had
been home, he wrote the district
superintendent of the Methodist
church in Des Moines, asking to
be placed as a student minister

SCARLET AND BLACK

somewhere in the state. He was

Oc’rber 7, I955

given the church m Malawi Deadline for Civil Service Exams

which had just lost its minister,
and because Grinnell was the
closest college, he iirolled here
this fall. Now li ng in the
church parsonage in Malcom,
Dwight commutes the ll miles
to Grinnell every day,

Dwight says he plans to go
to Grinnell for all four years,
and hopes to stay as minister
of the church as long as he is
here. He chose psychology
as a major because he thought
”it woud he of most value to
me in understanding and helps
ing people." Although he is not
sure whether in the future he
wants to work with the Salva~
tion Army, the church, or with
some other organization he
feels that ”Both may work in the
Army and in the church will
have value for anything I want
to do in the field of social or
religious nature in the future."

WHAT'S
THIS?

For solution, see
paragraph below.

A FLIGHT or IMAGINATION prompted the Dro'odle
above—it’s titled: Flying saucer with Lucky—smoking
crew. But it’s a down-to—earth fact that Luckies taste
better than any other cigarettes—and for down-to-
earth reasons. First of all, Lucky Strike means ﬁne

tobacco. Then, that light,
taste even better . . .

mild tobacco is wasted to

cleaner, fresher, smoother. So,

E‘Glurg shrdlul” (In saucer language, that means,

f-‘For taste that’s out of this world, light up at Lucky!”)
