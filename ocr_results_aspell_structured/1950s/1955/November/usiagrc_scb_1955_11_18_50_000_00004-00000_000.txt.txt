Women’s intramurals are just
beginning to pick up again now,
after coming to almost a com—
plete standstill last week. It
was the end of the hockey and
tennis seasons, and volleyball
and badminton have just now
hegun to be important.

Actual games were played

fax the first time this week,
and will continue until each
hall has played all the others.
This differs from the proced-
ure followed previously when
each hall yiayed until it lost
two games—this is called a
double elimination tournas
merit. Now that the Round—
robin type or tournament is
being used, the season will
probably be longer, but each
team will get a hotter chance
to prowe itself.
.Last Friday through Saturday,
a State WRA Convention was
held in Cedar Rapids. Grinnell
sent Carol Reploglc, Mary Ann
Holthues, Joyce Buck, and Sue
Ward as its reprcsentatives. All
four girls are members of the
Present WRA Board.

 

At the top of the list are
1955 carcaptams pout Jones and
Dick “Biggie" Walker, Paul, al-
though hobthled with injuries
much of the season, still emerge
ed as team paSSrrecelVing loader
with nine receptions for 99-
yards.

“Biggie,” a mainstay at let-t
tackle tor the past two seaa
sons, saw near fulletime duty
in almost every game this
year and was hard to stop on
both offense and defense.
