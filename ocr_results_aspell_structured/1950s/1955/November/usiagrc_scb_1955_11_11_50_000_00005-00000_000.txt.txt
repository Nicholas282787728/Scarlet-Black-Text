Carleton Again Favored

oh the basis of dual meet
competition, Carleton .will be
favored to notch its lit'lh straight
title. However. with tour powei»
tul teams and several outstands
ing individuals from the other
five team entries, the meet
promises to be a wild scramble
out of which any one or the
top four squads is liahla to
emerge victorious.

Grinnell will probably go in-
to battle with. the same lineup
that has captured seven \‘Ici0r~
ics this season. George Drake,
fourth in last year's loop run,
Lari-y Scllalc‘ge. eighth, and
captain Bob Downs have paced
the team throughout the season
and will be Grinlicll’s chiel
hopes tomorrow,

Pioneer Depth ‘

Strong team support Will
come lrom Dan Ver Ploeg, John
Weldon, Fritz Goreham, and Ed
Jantz, as it has all season,

Carletoii's defending champs,
who handed the pioneers their
only coniarenco loss this season,
will be led by wilbui- Olson,
third last year, who has been
near sensational in nearly every
outing this tall ,

Knight captain Earl Neil who
placed tenth m the was meet is

come veterans Paul Schultz and
Marty Baker.

Vikings Imprnve

Monmouth, whom Grinncll
barely doleated in a dual lnccl,
boasts solid team depth, paced
by number one man, Don
Graham. Since the Scot squad
)5 made up primarily oi sophos
mores, it lacks experience How-
ever the Scots are still given as
fine a chance as anyone.ln the
conlercnce finale,

Grinnell had an ca . time
with Lawrence, 21736, early in
the season. However the Vikings

Giav'e made remarkablepi-ogrcss
since their lii-st meet, as evlr
dcnccd by their recent meet
with Carleton who barely won
27-28.

Lawrence's Doug l-iagcn, seer
end in the conference (or the
past two years, is Wilbur Ol-
son’s chiei threat for the indlv
vidual title vacated by ex-
Carloionian John McCamant.

iou lioivcvci the team has
been hobbled with injuries all
season and has never been at
full strength,

However, with an open date
last weekend, the Scots should
be in their best shape or the
season.

Monmoulh's principal hack-
Ileld threats are Roger DcDera,
Jerry McBride, and Ronnie Wil—
lialns. The line is light and
somewhat inexperienced,

Same rioncer Lineup

Grinnell will again rely on
its potent running attack, ice»
turmg Sam Pctrotr, Seottv
