Grinncll finished second in
the meet last year as Carleton
won for the tourtli straight
time. On the basis of this fall’s
dual meets, Carleton must again
he accoi'dcd the ravorito's role,
although the Car-ls had a close
call with Lawrence last week,
eking out a 27-23 Victory.

Alter tho contercncc test, the
Pioneers will enter the Midwest

ln Hardtought Homecoming Contest

1500 chillcd homecoming one
thusiasts filled Ward Field last
Saturday to witness a 1377 loss
handed Grir-uoll by neighboring
rival, Cornell in a wellnnalched
contest.

The frigid. gathering had little
to cheer about, however, as the
Pioneers were held scoreless tor
two full periods and then could
manage to total but seven points
all afternoon.

Opponent Rains rallied to
score mice and then added one
extra, point to put the game on
“ice" before halftime.

Gordon Hansel broke away for
a 46 yard dash and six'points
in the ﬁrst quarter. Harry
Johnson followed with a five
yard plungc over left tackle,
adding six more in the second
stanza and Sam Benham suc-
needed in the extra point ale
tempt giving the Rams a 13 to

u edgo
To the disappointment ct all
involved the Scarlet and Black
couldn't quite come back and:
was finally held on their opal
ponenls’ seven yard line, just.
six points shy of a tie. :
Sam Porter however brought;
one ray of light into the dismal ‘
afternoon with a 3rd period 161
yard pass to Jack Shatter which i
was good for Grinnell's
completed pass and six points.
The Cornell contest marked
Peterson's second straight set—
back. Never-tlle»less neither has
told a true story.
Pionccr hopes were dealth a
blow midway in the game last

Saturday when a 50 yard runl

to the goal line w s called back
by a “quick whistle". Being held
[or_ tour downs on the Rams
seven also proved to he disasters
ous as well as a bad hreak.
