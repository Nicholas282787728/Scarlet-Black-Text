carry our above argument to its

To ‘tlie Editor:

We should like to question
the standards used in Judging
the Homecoming decorations,

it seems to us that thc plll"
pose of the hall displays is to
promote unity and spirit among
its members. The group shows
its ingenuity and cooperation in
producing an exhibit which is
pleasing to the eye and shows
the hoi 'ble misfortunes which
are sure to meet the opponents.

Reports from the judges say
that the choice ot winner de~
pends on art form, r thm, and
a clever slogan which must
pertain speciiically to the op«
posing team. Where does hall
spirit, and unity enter into these
standards? Only one or two poo»

pic create the slogan, and how
much docs "art form" Cuntrll)~
utc to hall cooperation?

Perhaps we should l’esdclillc
our purposes in having Home
coming portrayed hy cach liall,
so that next year the halls who
try the hardest to win may have
a chance. .
