"THE HOT SPOT"

“There is one theory,"

the teacher told her

young students, “That there may be as many as
a million people on the moon."

“Golly," gasped one kid in the rear of the room.
“What a squeeze it must be when it's a quarter

moon."

”Poor mixed-up kid! Wonder how he got that

way?”

”His ancestors were mixed up—Hailf of them
were men and the other half women.”

Slim Nut brought himself one of those midget-
,sized foreign make cars that the fellows in his

crowd were all raving

about and could hardly

wait to get it to his girl-friend’s house to show it

off to her. '

“Take a look at this, dad”, said he trying to look

nonchalanl.

“My goodness, where did you get that dinky
little thing?” she shrilledl

”Oh, it was normal size, but the auto laundry

shrunk it l"
