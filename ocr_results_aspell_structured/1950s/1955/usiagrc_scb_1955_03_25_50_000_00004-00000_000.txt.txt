.. .Asia continued

In the final speech of the
conference, entitled ”Viet
Nam and the U. S", Tran
Van Chuong stated that:

“The free world lost the
Indochinese war only because
it failed to understand that
the Vietnamese, like all other
Asiatic peoples, are more
afraid of colonialism than of
communism and that, conse-
quently, nothing is beter than a
colonial army to expand comr
munism in Asia.”

“Furthermore," he explained,
“the Vietnamese were lukewarm
in the lndochinese war because
they did not want to kill their
countrymen to win a war for
somebody else."

Although the armistice agreeri
inent of Geneva was a grave‘
and disastrous error, it had two:
good effects: it allowed the Wet i
namese to live and breathe after
twelve years of two wars, and}
it put pressure on France to‘
grant full independence to Indo:
china. The nationalist govern—l
ment of Premier Ngo Dinh Diem;
profited by these two advan—;
tages, he pointed out, for it,
gained full support of the popu~i
lation and brought to the re-;
maining half of Viet Nam the‘
magic formula of national inderi
pendence and direct American'
aid. 1

“The solution of the problem
will not be so easy for the Comri

nists in the North. for they

1 not be soon forgoten for di-
viding the country and killing
so many people in the process of
wantongly destroying practically,
all of North Viet Nam. The
Vietnamese in the North are now
realizing that the Viet Minh
have imposed incredible hard—
ships and sacrifices on them
only to replace French colonial-
ism by a much harsher on
Communist Chinese colonialism.",

In conclusion, he said that1
”because France has given us"
our independence, and becausci
of highly effective aid from the
U. s, we no longer feel antag—
onism toward the West. France
and the other western nations‘
are our allies; together we shall
win the fight with Communism”;

YOU'LL GET A BANG out of the Droodle above. The title is: Daredevil enjoy.
ing better-tasting Lucky just before being shot from cannon. Luckies are
going great guns everywhere. The reason for their booming popularity is
simply this: Luckies give you better taste. They taste better, ﬁrst of all,
because Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then, that tobacco is toasted
to taste better. “It‘s Toasted”—the famous Lucky Strike, process—tones up
Luckies‘ light, mild, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better . . .
cleaner, fresher, smoother. Enjoy yourself when you smoke. Have a little
fun. Light up the better-tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
