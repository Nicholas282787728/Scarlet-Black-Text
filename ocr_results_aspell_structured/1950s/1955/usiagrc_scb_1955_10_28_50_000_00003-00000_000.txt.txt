In October, 1922. a large re-
union was held in [he Floren-

tine room'of the Savory l-lotol

were provided Ior the day to
transport the team, parents,
faculty, and students Although
this was another step towards
the kind of celebration Gl
nell now acknowledges, this
homecoming was still consider»
ed "unofﬁcial”.

The “Red Letter" Home-
eorning eeremony on Nov. 5,
1924, .was a most gala attair;
a "pep-toast" was held in ARI-l
at- which a prominent speaker
entertained the faculty and
students; the play "You and
1" was presented ‘by the dra-
innties department, and an
elaborate dance was held in'
the Quadrangle drawing room.

crammed full of cﬂlllliils ilif

headlines bearing the words
“Beat that Alncs Bunch”, and
several full page ads “0100an

Six “Girls of the Century”
were nominated by the stud-

coed to hold the Homecoming

The l'irst football "recep-
