this large so that visibility is

easy thing to do, but, dispense

Cheating issue

The Stud rt Council voted
yesterday to end letters to the
head of departments where the
most ilacrunt cheating occurs as
decided by the special commits
tce ‘udylng the cheating pro-
hlcin.

it also decided to have the
committee draw Lllp a plan
whcrcby blue books would be
printtd with a pledge on the
order of ~1 have seen no cheat-
mg and have not cheated on this
domination,’ or whereby slips
with :ltch.pledges‘w0uld be in-
serted in the blue books.

The purpose of these pledges,
Ken Kassehoum, student coun-
cil president, said, is to give a
prom sor an indication 01 when
cheating has occurred on a test
and how much of it there was.
The theory behind the pledge
according to Ken is that students
who do not approve of cheating
will not sign the pledge it they
have seen it during a test, therev
by alerting both faculty and
students to the problem. A
Student Honor Board will be set
up to advise faculty members
of cheating and to make re-
commendations to them for pre-
\clltlng IL

The facility has discussed the
cheating problem, according to
Ken, and has changed the rule
for punishing cheating from “the
first casc may be punished by
failure on the examination" to
"the lust case ordinarily will he '
punished by iailure on the ox-
animation."

The council also heard Dean
oi Men Hairy Grace who sugn
gcslctt thc council consider the
problem of student-faculty l‘er
latiollshll s. Alter considerable
discussion, the council voted to
set up a committee to investh
gate the problem. Fat liarrabec,
Martha Wear-in, and Dave Smith
will be council members or the
student body.

Alphanettc White and Dick
wil‘liunis were selected as south
and noith campus chairmen ior
(hooslng people who would like
to meet with Di: Bowen at his
weekly roundtablos.

Kasscbauin also announced
that the central committee of
the rouncil is now functioning
as an executive council to deal
with matters to trivial tor the
attention of the council, to plan
the agenda for council meetings,
to serve as liason between
studcnt government and tactilty,
and to discuss and help expedn
itc important matters coming
lieloi-c the council.

The agenda ot the student
council meals will be posted on
Wednesday afternoons in ARI-1
starting next weclr,
