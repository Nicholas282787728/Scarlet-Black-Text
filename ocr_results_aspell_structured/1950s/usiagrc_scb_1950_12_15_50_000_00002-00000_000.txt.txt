Light to Peace

This week we saw Christmas getting into full swing.
One thing we noticed was a number of persons making
elaborate and attractive Christmas candles. While one
flickered its translucent light away in a darkened empty
room, it gave us pause to think. ‘

The flickering candle looked almost like a pagan shrine
in miniature with its foot flanked by heaped, bright glass
baubles. It looked like one candle lifted from the banks of
lights in a Catholic church. It looked like the candles that
ﬂoat across a lake at a summer camp when ten-year—olds
are more impressed by the sacredness of their wishes than
their more sophisticated counselors.

Lightifire—sunistars. They have meant all things
to all peoples. While the light of faith shines for the He-
brews, the sun blazes in deity to the Japanese, and the
heroes of fiction remain transfixed in fire and its symbol-
ism, we can look back to the story giving rise to all the
lights of Christmas. The star of Bethlehem in actuality or
interpretation pointed a way to peace if the teachings of its
object were to be followed.

When we light our Christmas tree lights all over the
United States on our return home, let us endeavor to light
peace. This is not written in irony. Steps toward world un-
derstanding can be taken by us continually, particularly in
the direction of education. We can try to learn as much as_
possible of the peoples, philosophies, sciences, cultures, and
histories of the world. And we can attempt to make it pos-
sible for others to learn.

Programs with these aims are numerous. If our efforts
to work in the direction of one of them matched the number
of Christmas lights we burn this vacation, the lights would
take an added significance. Real insight inspired the state-
ment, “Americans are the greatest realists and the great»
est idealists in the worl .”
