Approves Plan for Three-Hour
Courses To Be Adopted Here

The faculty approved a proposal to change the course
plan of Grinnell college by a voice vote last: Monday.

The plan, unanimously recommended by the executive
council of the college, will put Grinnell‘on a three, as well
as four hOlll' course basis. Before becoming official, it must
be approved by the educational policies committee of the
Board of Trustees. No date has been set for this committee
to act on the proposal.

Dean of the College Max E. Fuller, in commenting on
the change, said, “One of the practical effects of the change
will be to give the student more leeway in taking elective.
courses outside of graduation and distribution requirements
and their field of concentration

for teaching and for professional graduate school, also, for
most graduate schools judge entrance requirements on the

,hasis of three hour courses.”
