Women To Compete At Darby
_ In Annual Dance IM Tomorrow

WRA will present the annual dance intramurals to~
morrow night at eight in Darby gym.

Dances are judged on theme composition, dance techv
nique, costumes, and music. The judges will be Miss Mar-
jorie A. Cass, (education), Mrs. Thomas E. Lasswell, Miss
Marjorie Micllels, Dirk Baay, (German), and Charles L.

Luckenbill (music).

“Loose Goes \Latin;” Mam
will be "Under the Bounding
Main;” “Greek Gods and Gods
desses” will be diffused through
Cleveland's dances, Hailies’
theme will be "lsm Prism,” with
Read following in "Dance, A
Part of Life.” James will depict
“The Bookshop" to end the pro-
gram.

Loose’s theme follows the
course of the day in South
America. The natives awaken-
ing from their siesta go to
the hull fights where matadors
perform At 1 night club samba
girls do their dance. A mid-
night tango (lone by South
American beauties ends Loose‘s
Latin thy.

Main pirates will open “Under
the Bounding Main." The Ship
on which the pirates (lance
sinks and the next scene takes
place in King Neptune's court
with an underwater ballet.
Sprites and mermaids in turn
then take over the theme.

Cleveland will show a young
Greek couple traveling through

life honoring their gods and
goddesses.

Cupid’s arrows fly as the
couple falls in love. Next, at the
marriage feast nine muses enter-
tain. Tragedy enters as the
young man is called to war.
when Cleveland's “modern goes
ancient" is performed to the
war god. The grand finale is
to Bacchus, god of wine and
merriment, as the young man
returns and joy reigns.

To show how the average
college student becomes con-
{used by the isms of art,
music, and literaturo is the
aim of mines “lsm Prism.”
Fitting dances to the music
of the periods, using a dif—
ferent basic color to depict
romanticism, realism, nat-
uralism, and symbolism, and
satires will be the features of
their theme. The end? the
isms arise and overwhelm the
poor college student.

Read will portray the use of
dance through the ages. The
first form talrcs place in relig-
ion, then the peasants take
over in presenting the polka as
a form of relaxation. The dance
then takes on formal sophistica-
tion in the minuet of the French
courts, and the spectators pro—
ceed in a type of mexhibition as
done in night clubs of today
in jazz bop, Read combines the
classical, the folk, with modern
and take-offs; these are tied to-

gether by the dance movments.

A bookshop at closing time
will be danced by James. The
saleswoman is reshclfing the
