Campus Social chairman,
Sugar Creel: hill is forbidden at
night. and is not advisable lil'
the daytime. Bailey suggests
that there is an another hill at
Lake Acre which 15 free of
trees and Dtllﬂr dangerous fear
tlu‘es. This slope, he adds, also
is advantageous because of the
cabin facilities aftercd.

The toboggans arc hopt.at
the heating plant and, in the
iuturc, anyone wishing to use
them must check them out
through Bailey or Ron Book.

These measures, it is hoped,
will eliminate or greatly reduce
tobaggal'ling accidents. Five
Grinnelllans wcro iniured in the
course or the past weekend and
the subsequent experiences were
not too pleasant.

it has been related to the
arithor (while she was at the
local hospital) that a sign in
Cowles advertising “Winter
Sports—Skiing, Tohogganing,
Ice Skating" now reads, thanks
to a clever soul, “ . Skiing
(it you want to break a leg),
Toboggauing (it you wont to
get killed), Ice Skating (if
you want to break your
ankle).”

The reiercnee to the hospital
brings back the iond rccollcc-
Iion of Monday, known as piss
ler Day,/wllen three Grillnelr
lians waited in line for their
casts.

The standard greeting now to
those who are hobbllng, cl'iltchc
ing, wheeling, or even wearing
a large .2 band-aid around
campus is “Another one?”

The kindness and considers
tion shown, (all the way from
door»holdcrs to the smiling Saga
people) is over-powering, yet
the stiuggln to regain normalcy
(from the ichv adhesive to the
adininislrativerpower-that - he)
is equally dominant.

A iew tobogganing rules
from one who knows. go in
the daytime, preicrably with
someone who can steer: re—
niain calm; crying and scream-
ing are so nauseous, but don’t
be a martyr; it accidentally
ooniined to any place, do be
kind to the lady who wakcs
you rip at an ungodly hour to
take your temperature; thank
all the people who have helps
cd you, running trorn the bi-
iers or ovoryoiie's own theory
or first aid (there are then;

. sands, believe me) to the nurse
who whcolcd the toot of your
broken log into the wall at
the hospital.

Most of all, however, rccoll
tobogganing, and all the times

thersled stopped quietly as you
’and your iriends laughingly got
up and walked away, pulling it
up the hill to do it again,

"Gr-cater Gi'iilllull” (or what
ever) building plan. Marvelous
thing, Hero, that iiondish com
mittee gave up pursuing good
ends badly and applied itscli to
achieving bad buds quickly.
Having hit upon a iantastically
nondescript architectural style
in the science building, the ad-
ministration gaily committed itr
self to building a whole group
oi similar structures, each re-
semblillg the first . . . and all
rc‘scillbllilg International Harves-
tor showrooms.

And“ another: the muddle oi

plan was conceived, as l rindcr-
stand it, to provide extra work,
independent work) that is, inn
dependent oi the herd), for the
more giitod, and more 1iltel‘~
ested, student. Fine and good.
Laudable. Let those who want to
Strike Out On Their Ownl

The results have been dread-
iul. By last semester every
upper assmim in the school
wastoiling undcr the yoke oi
one or more projects. Whole )
classes were assigned identical
“independent” projects. In
short, everybody was busy,
busy. Unfortunately, it didn‘t
work out. Nine out oi tcn
students threw lheir' pnl‘ar
phrased crud together in‘ two
nights—.thc last two nights of
(he semester—and damned the
clowns who had so misnpplicd
what was basically a good
idea.

On the face of it, there would
seem to be little correlation be»
tween treeJopplng, painting,
and 3-4 projenls, but the student
who looks at tile matter closely
will perceive that they have in
common two leatures: they all
wobble down to him from the
higher echelons, and they arei
without exception, 3 bit silly.
