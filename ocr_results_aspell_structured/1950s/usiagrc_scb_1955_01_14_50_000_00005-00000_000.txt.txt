Grinnell showed bl'iel signs of
reatness at the beginning of
he second, period as they raced

ut abruptly as Coe tallied 13

ained. Then in the next six
inules, they fought back from
a dim deficit to trail by just
two points, 76-73, when the

the contest on ice.

The teams late surge was
ead by reserves Larry Koch and
lo Rampelberg, and Dick Kirk-

game for coach John Pfitsch.
John Musser, who was taken out
in the first period after picking
up three fouls, returned in the
second ham to notch ten points
and 15 rebounds. High scorer
was Dick Crawl who tallied 20
points, 12 coming on free throws.

Held Half-Time Lead

Grinnell started much better
in the second contest, holding a
26-14 lead over the Carls after
ten minutes of the first half had
elapsed and a 40-37 lead at his
termission.

At the start of the second half
John Musser hit three consecur

margin to nine before the Carle-
ton court jinx began to catch up.
Once the Carls tookia twoepoint
lead at 5553, they never re-
linquished it, although the Pi —
neers never fell behind by more
than seven.

ing three weeks of holiday in-
activity. The Oles. led by Con-
ference distance champ Howie
Cedarblade. promise to make
the Pioneer's first home start of
1955 a rough one.

in addition to Cedarblade,
who copped both the 220 and
440 yard freestyle races last
year, St. Olaf also has a fine
breaststroker in Don otterson.
otterson was second only to
Grinnell's Pete Vassilakos in the
Midwest conference meet and
is rated the top man in his
specialty this year.

was senior Howie Runyan, who
