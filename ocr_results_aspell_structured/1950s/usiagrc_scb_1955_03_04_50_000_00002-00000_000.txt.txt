Last week the faculty approved of the reorganization
of the structure of the Board of Publications. The new
committee will be known as the “Committee on Student
Publications," The old Board is made up of three faculty
members, the treasurer of the college, the student council
president, the editors and business managers of the S&B
and Cyclone, and the editor of the S&B literary supplement.

The new Committee on Student Publications will be
made up of four faculty members, (one of whom will be a
journalism professor), the treasurer of the college, three
students representing and electedby the Student Council,
and ’one student representing aiid elected by the editors and
business managers of student publications. The remaining
editors and business managers of the publications will be
consultant members with no vote.

That the membership has changed from a student-fac-
ulty<administration ratio of 6:3:1 to 4:4:1 is not as ims
portant as the change in the composition of the membership
from six publications representatives and one Student Coun-
cil represenative to three Student Council representatives
and one publications representative.

Those who favor the change do so on the grounds
that the publications should be subject to general control.
More specifically they argue that the present Board has
tended toward self interest and self prepetuation. They
point out as an example of self interest that the members
of the Board in the past have voted themselves bonuses.
The charge of self-perpetuation is assumed to mean that
in electing their successors the members of the Board have
chosen those whose policies and standards are similar to
their own

The opponents of the change argue that the self
interest of the Board has been eliminated in an action
early this year in which the Board unanimously passed a
rule that no bonuses be paid henceforth. Those in favor of

This week we turn the col-
umn over to Deacon Lconi—
das Q. Jackson, who has just
arrived iroin the Oznrkios
with a message ior us all.

My friends (and you are my
friends, for we are all brothers)
the spectre of dirty, unAmei-ican
subversion is rearing its ugly
head once more. But we are just
sitting by and letting ii. But not
all oi us, nosirrec, You may
think that Sen. Joe McCarthy
(May God make His face to
shine upon him) is going it
alone, but, friends, this ain’t
true. Where i come from we
got our own methods (sonar
iied. naturally, by the blood of
fallen comrades.) Brethren, rm
here to show you how you can
help,

First oi all, you picks a
likely looking Red. Your illv
siincis on matters like this
ain‘t never wrong. Why, one
time back home, we spotted
one. Un-Americanism stuck
out all over him. So we drew
up this here oath. Next night
we caught him comin‘ out of
the library. Had a book by
this Dos Passos fella. There
was me and Ed Bagby, and
Sam Hankinsi And we puts ii
to this fella either he signs the
oath or else.

Well, sir. the dirty Commie
gets his back up. Says he ain't
agonna sign. Says he got cons
stitutionai rights 1 tell you,
friends, these dang subversive:
got more gall than you can im-
agine We didn't see much use
in tellin' him nice like (you got
to be firm with ’em.) So we
kind a slandered him a little

the change reply that next year the Board could easily ,and convinced him ’He ﬁnally

reverse this ruling.

In regard to the question of self—perpetuation the
opponents of the new plan state that the editors and busi-
ness managers of the publications are more qualified to
choose their successors than those outside the field, and.
that self perpetuation is impossible because of the coin-
position of the Board when it comes right down to voting.

Those in favor of the change feel that the subjection
of the publications to more general control would either
make the publications more accurately a voice of the stu-
dents, or would make no difference at all Those opposing the
change feel that “that government governs best which
.governs last.” They point out that the three representat-
tives chosen by the Student Council might very likely be

come around to our way oi
thinkin'. But this ’5 just an
exempli gratis. (Schooling)
Now, i heard tell about this
college. My iricnds, colleges is

headsi Right here, you teaches
Russian Historyl You reads
fellas like this Dante. You
maybe diam know it, but The
Dante Alighieri Society is on
the General Attorney's list.
You can buy books by Mai-x
right in your own book store
Now. brethren, l hear you
shoutin'. "What can I do about

Thank you, Deacon Jackson,
it certainly is good to know that
the Junior Senator from Wisconv
sin has support down there in
the Ozarkies. Let’s get on the
ball now, fellow students. Don’t
make Joe go it alone. Burn your
Copies or the “Divine Comedy”;
stone Sam Wassom; write poison
pen letters about Mr. Speronis;
get this book. You too can be a
little Red witch-hunted

Tu the editor:

Concerning the title oi a re-
rcni sacs series, we wonder if
i. is taken from the great Falks
ncr novel. or springs tram the
Shakespearean quotation, “It is a
great sound and iury signifying
nothing."

"There Seems to be in this
world two classifications of pea»
lple; iihose who classliy people
and iihosg who don't” We feel
that in successfully classiiying
the majority of the Grinnell
Student Body, the anchor nas
omitted an important prompye,
that which possesses the rare
lnystlc virtue of classifying ohher
people. 80 per cent of the slur
dciii body voted in the Student
Council election, prompting a
tyvo»colunll‘i ibl-ast on student
apathy, 77 per cent turned out
ior ilic recent c oi Hr elections
such is the power of the primed
word.

At the risk oi being thrown
into that category wlhlch has
nohhing better in do’ bhan Ipan
5&3 writers, we remain.

This is one of those longpui—
off, much-talkedrof, letters-ta
Abe-editor, (not that its going
to do any good department).
This may be a lime 'bit out of
your line, but no one else seems
to be interested, so here goes. . .

We have been loyiil Grinnel-
lians in most respects we know
Mr two and one half years, on
campus and off. These days our
loyalty leaves us as we order
ihc Quadrangle dining room.
This is a rather recent develop-
ment and to prove that it is, we
can safely say ihci, in previous
years we have gone so far as to
praise Grinnell food. We have
said in iihc past that the selec»
tion was exceptional for institu-
tional iood, . . .no longer is iihis
the case.

no this point we question one
another to see ii penhaps it is
merely old age or junior pes-
simism which makes us ailack
the dear quad menu, Discarding
these thoughts we come to iihc
conclusion that there really is
something lacking in our meals.
ii is not roast beei, nor is it
chili, nor is 1! corn friters. Be-
sides this, the food is of inter—
ior quality, and this is the opin—
ion of many.

We, leasi oi all, having been
raised as polite individuals, like
to hit below the belt on such an
issue, and that is not our in-
tention. We would like a com-
ment on bhis prdoimn as we
have been living on bread alone
(well, not quite) during this
school year. Let’s get ihe meals
back up to the standards other
areas of Grinnell life mainmain.
Expressing an opinion and-hoping
for results.

Hungrily yours.

free to criticize, and state the analogy that a metropolitan titled, "God, Joe and Me.” It

at home, at work or on the way

newspaper does not have members of the city council or
the police force on its controlling board because these
organizations though representing and elected by the pub-
lic should be open to criticism.

Those in favor of the change point out that the new
committee, like the old, does not have power of censorship
The opposition points out that they have retroactive power
of dismissal and that since the committee selects the new
editors and business managers they have the ability to
stifle the avowedly critical mind before it breaks into
print.

We do not mean to imply that those in favor of the
change are exclusively faculty members, or members of
the Faculty Organization Committee, nor that those op-
posed to the change are exclusively students or members
of the Board of Publications. This would be a gross mis—i
represenation for there are members in each of these groups
favoring and opposing the plan. ‘

We have tried carefully to present an unbiased picture)
of the arguments both for and against the new committee,
and we leave the final evaluation to your discretion We
are interested in your reaction either verbal or written.‘
The student publications are yours: your way to make
your powers and desires felt and heard. Whether this end
can best be sewed under the present Board of Publications
which will be defunct‘following spring vacation or under
the new Committee on Student Publications which will be—
come effective at the same time is left for you to decide.
