“This Was Our Finest Hour"

ANYTHING is worth commenting on, The Kingston Trio is
nothing out oi the ordinary. They have been in e. .tcnce but
three years and the type oi music the 'e is neither novel nin-
eipccinlly hard to sing, Their contributl to the evening as in-
dividual personalities were nothing different ironr most such pro-
J’cssionnl entertainment groups.

Why then was their tune worth $1750 an hour? thn the con-

t was drawn up, rwas there a tune element n olvcol, or did

y merely consent to s‘ lg last Tuesday night until they got tired

more likely. until they ran out or songs?

For those people who did not enjoy the concert, it must havc

red an cxol'bitant waste, Those who did enjoy it and appreciate

10 l: music were cheated even more.

. Doesn't the student Council have the right to require that a
group oi enleraincrs give a conccrt oi reasonable length? it they
don't, any group could walk onto the platiorrn, sine three songs,
collect their check ior $1750, and leave. It the council agreed to
arr hour concert, they slrirked their responsibility to the students

or _Grrnnell. ll they didn’t set some minimum limit, they were
taking a great chalice with otircr people's money.

The Kingston Trio is gone, as is the $17 ll, But the s nre thing
can happen again unless the council can assume the responsibility
that goes- along with handling the money that belong. to us, the
slidcnts of Grinnell, in the i'uturcg will we do something to in- e
that the council spends our money to the greatest advanlaec or will
