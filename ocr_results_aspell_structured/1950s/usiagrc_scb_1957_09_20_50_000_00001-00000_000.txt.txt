Year's Enrollment
Increases By 80

An estimated total of 946
students will attend classes
at Gl-innell during the 1057-
E58 academic year. This is an
increase of 74 over last
year's total of 866.

Reasons for the increase in-
clude a higher number of ap-
plications by new students and
a loivorcd ratc of attrition by
old students. This year’s fresh»
man class numbers 325 which
is as more than the t'reslurian
class of 1955. in addition it was
ncocssary to reject 110 applica—
tions, approxmiatciy twice as
many as during the previous
ycar,

Juniors and seniors make tip

A total at 105 prov-mush- ens
rollcd students did not return

half of thcsc wcro torcibly
dropped by the academic stands
ing committee. This figure is
“not unusual” acro ding to R.
