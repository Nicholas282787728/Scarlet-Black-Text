Charles Yoak, Gates presi—

SEGREGA‘TION
Cant. from page -1

The white had to speak out for
segregation; to support their
stand they had to oppose the
Negro in overt, cruel terms.

The racial separation that
had in general been accepted
quietly and even apatheticaily
in the past was now the iocus
or all attention. The separa-
tion grew by the very nature
oi the attention being given-to ,
it.

in the North, which is as
c h a r actcristicaliy anticscgregas
tionist in ideals as it is subtly
proud of its liumanita an supci»
iority to the South. it is dit-
licuit to approach this problem
with an open mind. To do so,
we must divorce ourselves trom
thoughts ot the screaming wo-
man we saw pictured in news-
papers cruelly shrieking “Go
home nigger" to a Negro child
trying to enter a newly dcscgre
gated Southern school, and or
that woman’s child, apmg her
intolerance.

Status Threat Seen

This woman and her lellcws
in the mob are, we must re»
member, in the clutches ot mob
psychology, Beneath these vio~
lent manitestations lies an innate
sense of racial superiority
which in turn gives rise to the
feeling ol insult when press rc
is exerted toward an equaliza-
tion of the races This pressure
ls seen as a threat. to the Status
ot the white, rather than as a
movement toward the elevation
of the Negro.

The white South's icelings
are steeped in a tradition that
has grown out of a multitude
of economic, psychological,
a nth r opolngical, sociological
and governmental tactors.

dent. said, “We have a great re-
spect to the c of HP’S program,
but we lclt that the aduistmcnt
was nee. al'y_-lo meet particular
nccds in he hall" According to
Yoak, the outstanding need it as
a revision in thc prepping pro-
gram, “hi the past," he said,
"the weakness has been in the
upperclassmcn. We now hope to
make them the strength at the
program, by iinpr ng upon
them the respon bihty which
thcy have to each freshman,”

Yank cited as an example
oi thi. esponsibility, an ad.
viscrsadvisce relationship that
will c‘dst between the fresh-
meng d the upperciassmeu.
Each ircshman will 'clioosc a
upperclassman to act as his
hail adviser, who will aid him
in meeting the tour require
ments l'or hall membership,

Yoak stressed the fact that
except for the changes ‘stipu-
latcd, the entire program will
be formulated by the house
council. He added, “the revision
of the program will not only im-
prove prcpping but all aspects
oi" hall life."

The basic assumption under-
lying the segrcgational plattorm
is that the Negro is interior and
that the segregation plattorm
is that the human race is nat-
ural and was physiologically ai»
ranged by the Creator The seg-
regatiomst otten presents a

This, in the Southerner’s eyes

Court asks him to mingle with.
Strangely enough, the people in
the South, and even in the Deep
South, are willing to live in
geographic proxnnity to the

“Mongreliznlion” Feared

What the scgrcgaticnists do
[car is that close -intermingling
of the races at early ages will
result in a laeling ot equality
between the superior and the,
inierior race From this comes
the tear that Negroewhlte clat-
ing and ultimate marriage will
lead to a racially non-biased
society. The ultimate tear is not
merely of a race of slightlyl
darker Americans, as someY
sociologists cvision, (U, S, Ncws'
and World Report, Sept 19.
1958) but rather ot the total
"mongrelizatlon of the Anglo—i
American civilization."

This tear is paralleled to the}
breeding ol top-quality pedir‘l
grcc dogs with mongrcls and,
the resultant mediocre animall
is seen as analogous to a inn—l
latto child, Supposedly this}
"inevitable" (according to the
Segregalloliist) mixing ol the
races will result in a new race
intei r to the present whites
and slightly superior to thcl
present Negroes It is ogainstl
this tear that the might of “mas—
sive resistance” is directed.
