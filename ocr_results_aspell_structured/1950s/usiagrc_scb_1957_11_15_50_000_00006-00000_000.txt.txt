ning practice heiore retiring
to their rooms in the Hotel

Winder-mere, “The purpose,”
quotes Coach Irv Simone, “is
to tamiliarize the boys with
the diniculties or the track."

Lawrence, Cornell 'lud Carle-
ton are the teams to beat, as
each has defeated Grinnell in
dual meets, Due to tiu and in-
juries however the harriers
were minus a minimum of two
men from the starting seven at
each or these contests. For this
reason, the Pioneers are opti—
mistic about their chances.

Said Simone, “Though the
{team has just reached the usual
,mid-season form, with a iew
lbreaks we should be able to
take a second."

Grinnell placed second last
year behind Carleton. This year‘
the Knights will have to rely
primarily on one man, while
Lawrence places its hopes on
‘Plnkertcn and Sutherland. For
the Pioneers, Chuck Yoak, who
presently holds down the num-
her two position, due to injuries
failed to run against Lawrence.l

John Welden, who will be
running his last tormal race,
combined with Yoak as Grin—
nell's primary threat tor in-
dividual honors. However, the
thinclads will depend on
depth in overall team score,
Louis Sachs, Norman Snnju,
John Kennedy, Walt Nccvel,
and Fred Boughey make up
the rest or the squad. Art
Kisser, who showed promise at
the hcginning of the season,
has, due to injuries, been held
back from reaching his poten-
tinL Risser, states Simone, has
proved an asset to the team
and should see a lot of duty
1 next year.

“The cross»country record of
{473 is due for the most part to
la lack of experience. This year's
team, composed primarily ot
sophomores,” continues Simone,
“has been stymied by a lack of
conditioning; but, this has been
because of flu and unexpected
injuries, and not in any way
a lack of enthusiasm. Their
endless desire to overcome uri-
foreseen obstacles is very in-
spiring to a coach.”
