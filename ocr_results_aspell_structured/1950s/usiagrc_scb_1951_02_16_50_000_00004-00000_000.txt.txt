Men’s Council
Suspends Three
On Drink Charge‘

By the Council
or House Presidents

While last week’s article onl
the drinking policy of the c of
HP was being written, there,
came before the Council a case:
of misconduct and damage re-:
sulting from drinking which the
c of HF would like to discuss
with the men in this article.

On Saturday evening of Feb-
ruary 3, three men returned to
Langan Annex very much in-
toxrcated. Instead of going to
their own rooms and to bed.
they proceeded to tear up the
room of a lriend, breaking a,
small stand, coke bottles, and
light bulbs. In the rest room.
the paper dispensers were ripped‘
Irom the wall; likewise was a
thermostat pulled on,

These men were all under age,
they admitted collectively'to all
the damage, and to the fact
that they were very drunk. Their
action affected the greatest numn
ber of men in Langan Annex
and, in a general way, affected
all the men of the North,Camr
pus.

The c of HP recommended to
the Personnel Board that these
men be suspended from school
for ten days, and the reccm~
mendation was accepted.

In this case the men were,
reported and punished for their
actions, and yet it seems unfor—l
tunate that other instances simc
ilai to this one have failed to
come before the C of HP be—
cause the students have “an
er.ed" I

The Council doesnt relish the
idea of punishing, and like the
students, clues not enjoy regula-i
tions- yet some rules are neces—i
saiy and must be enforced if
we are going to be able to eliml
inate those men from Grinnell
who lack the will power to cons
duct themselves as gentlemen
