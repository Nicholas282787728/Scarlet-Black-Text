This “’0 Believe:

l. N0 advance nutice \
given 01 the topic that. was
be brought no in housetnecs
ings last Monday night. In 0 1'
opinion the ISSUC should hair

that several points, heretofore that it is Supposed to, that no bum premium and debate no

clouded in obscurity or emo-
tion, were cleared up.

i. The proposal was tor a
Student Council liason oiileial
who would sit in on all League
Board and C oi HP meetings
and report to the Student Courts
cii Central committee. The sugr
gostion that an 5&3 reporter
serve in this capacity was only
an afterthought on the part of
the person making the suggess
linn.

2. This suggestion in no way
out doiiiits upon the abilities
or integrity oi the presidents
oi the League Board and the
6 iii up. The reason that
those persons were not pro-
noseﬂ as the hump ofﬁcials
is simply that their ultimate
i-cspoiisibili y lies to the
bodies or which they are
presidents and to the men or
women.

a. The Student Council would
like to have zin ottiecr whose
ultimate authority is to the
council and the students as a
wholc.

i. The Student Council is not
interested in the personal prob-
lems oi individual girls No
names will he mentioned in the
reports. We are interested in
problems as representative at
r‘ampuéswtdo problems, or as
the result oi outside pressures
which the council eould allevi-
ate.

5. The liliison oiiiciiii will
report to the Central coni-
iiiittcc wiiieli meets in closed
ses 'oii. Thereiore the report
will lie transmitted ii-om one
closed iiieetins {League Board
or, c of HP) to another closed
ineetinz (Central committee).

6. The liaison official will of
necessity he lizzlitrlipped and ([157
erect, Said Official will be ap-
proved by League Board and C

The purpose of the suggestion
is to provide a vehicle tor the

At present, our only souree

Because we have elected these
