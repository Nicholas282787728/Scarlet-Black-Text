Two Platoons

Gone- Wally

Learns Defensive Strategy

by George Drake

Grinnell welcomes back single
platoon football tomorrow after-
noon against the Lawrence Vik—,
ings, Leading the Ploneers out ,
of‘huddles will be Wally Stevens,
their hard»chal‘ging veteran
center.

Wally, c Dibble senior, is en. ,
tering his third season as a ‘
Pioneer gridder. During his
sophomore year, he saw ac
tion as a guard, but last year
was switched to center where
he was a line stalwart. Wally‘s
play during the ras: two years
earned him two varsity lct—
ters which makes him one oi
the few returning twoeletter ,
men on the squad.

Because of the rule change,
Wally will have to do another,
adapting job this year, in ore‘
der to play both defense andi
offense. Wally has never play-l
ed defensive ball, but, accord-i
ing to line coach Bob Peterson,‘
“he is doing a very good job
defensively." Peterson also com-
mented on Wally's general im-
provement over last year,

especially at offensive blockingl‘as you win

Pfitsch thinks that his charges
will be able to give the highly
rated Vikings a tough afternoon.
with three weeks of practice
behind them the squad is show»
ing signs of becoming a smooth.
ly operating outfit.

Pfitsch points out that most
of his hacks went both mys
last year — as did a good
many or the forward wall, so
the switch has not been dim»
cult. Due to the tact that the
squad is familiar with the T-
forination attack this year
more emphasis has heen placed
on the defense, which was
rather lacking last year,

With only 11 lettermen back

1from last year's squad, which

dropped eight straight, Pfitsch
is having to draw from the
sophs and last year's reserves
for his replacements. He states
that if certain key men are
able to escape the type of ins
iuries that plagued the squad
last year, the Pioneers could
give the dopesetters a rough
time of it. The fact that seve
eral of the newcomers on the
squad are giving the veterans

‘a scramble for their positions

Glass Backboards

New glass hackboards pur<
c’hased this summer for $500,
will be installed in Darby gym
by Sept. 30, according to Nor—
man Marble, superintendent of
buildings and grounds.

Basketball Coach John Pﬁuch
said that the old metal back»
boards are being removed “to
comply with an N.CvA-A- tul-'
ing" and “to give our boys in
better chance of winning out-
of»town games where most
schools now have the glass
hoards."

Last year‘s Pioneer hoopsters
won all eight of their home
games on metal boards. but
could salvage only two Victories
in ten tries on foreign courts.
