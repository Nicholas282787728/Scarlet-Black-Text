Dateline: Spring Day

As 1 pound out this little gem
of campus journalism, 1 find that
I am rather tired. So much has
happened in the last few hours,
or for that matter, days regard—
ing Grinnell’s worst kept secret
that‘to list them all would take
up more space than Leon has
allowed me. I do feel, however,
that a few remarks are in or-
der.

First of all I want to thank

Tom Rodhouse, Pete Bradford,
Gary Hayes. Caryl Wagner,
Marge Voytilla, Charlie Hastings
and Steve Payne for the work
they put in on this Soiree.

To Jersey Williams, my
heartfelt regards for his assist-
ance in the dining room.

To Steve MacDonald, my
thanks for emceeing the Show

To the Editor:
1 would like to suggest a
change in the officiating system
of the Grinnell intramural pro.
gram Several times during the
past season poor officiating has
cost a hall a ballgame. It has
been the same in every sport. In
football, I have seen touchdowns
called back because of an early
whistle, teams getting away with
one foul after another and quar-
ters run way over-time because
the time keeper forgot to Start
the clock after a time out.
in volleyball, there were hard—
ly any officials who knew the
first thing about the game.
Many of the halls made their
freshmen referee, some of Whom
had never played the game. Very
few 01 the refs called a penalty
fvl‘ reaching over the net.
What’s Wurst, what one of-

ﬁcial will call a loul, another
will allow. The same applies
to basketball. Sometimes the
W takes on the appearance
of a. combined wrestling-toot—
ball match with hoops at
at either end of the playing
fiell'li

In softball, batters and pitcha
ers alike, face the problezn of the
the “moving plate." It seems the
umpires just can’t make up their
minds as to where the Strike-Zone
is. One i Iain-g he will be on the
,pitchGT’s side and the next in-
ning on the batter‘s. Some call
strikes with their left hand.
some forget the count

and

others can’t figure out the plays
mg area. ln softball, as in the
other major sports, many times
the official is ‘asleep,’ and fails
to see a vital play. He then de-
cides the team that yells the
loudest is right, and the game
goes on. .

in a recent game, an umpire
missed a play by a good two

icet, but he didn’t have the
nerve to admit that he didn’t
see it and asked his associates

to call the playf It cost a team
the ball game.

Naturally, the poorer the Mr
ficiating, the more arguing
there is, and it results in a poor—
er game, both tor the player
and the spectatorl In order to
improve the present system or
selecting referees, 1 suggest that
the intramural department
choose eight or ten men for each
sport, and choose only those
who know the sport well, and
have had some experience. In
onder to assure getting only the
best, i think those appointed
should 12:: paid a respectable sal-
ary covering the entire season
in which they work.

in this way, each official will
be obligated to work on certain
days. ,ust like most other school
employment jobs. I feel that this
system would be a distinct im—
proveinent over the present one,
and would assure us of having
a better intramural program.

Sincerely,
John Wallace

Far From

Customary
Skies

lsy Gene Thompson

The two "riots” that took place
this week looked like fun, from
a distance. i always find a cer—
Lain amount of enjoyment in be»
ing with a happy crowd at
cheering, singing college men,
gathered around a tire on a
spring evening. And‘ i still have
some affection (probably lell.
over from childhood) for the
work oi i'iremen putting out a
iii-c.

Too had, though, that a large
children’s sandbox (stolen from
the yard of a Grinnell familyi
replaced by the college) and sev-
eral dozen coke cases had
to go up in flames to proVide
the ”fun.” Too, the needless ty-
ingup of the volunteer fire de~
partment and the damage to the
asphalt paving of Park street
provided the townspeople with
a completely lustified reason for
a cool attitude toward the col-
lege.

One fireman remarked that
ii the fire had been in one at
the dormitories, he wouldn’t
have raised a hand to put it
out.

Our own faculty and adminis—
tration, which has recently re-
laxed a great many rules and
remedied a great many long-
standing gripes, might lbe won»
dering i1 they have done right
in recognizing some maturity
and responsibility in Gl'lnnell
student . A general “tightening
up" of social and academic regu—
lations could follow as a result
of Norm Campus' action on Mon-
day and Wednesday nights. (It
has already been suggested that
the campus be patrolled by a
special, tuil»time policeman. The
college could be made to look
like a home for wayward boys).

Outsidc of the college situa-
tion, the “rioters” would be
classified as “juvenile delina
quents," “vandals" or “adult
violators," according to age,
and there would he rm question
about a mass arrest and con—
viction. Tear gas and riot guns
are used against European stu-
dents, and some oi them even
have a cause.

It’s quite obvious that Grinnell
men engaged in “riots" for the
same reason that they complain
that the Scarlet and. Black
“doesn't crusade enough." in
both cases, the desire to chall-
enge authority rears its ugly and
juvenile head. It doesn’t seem to
matter that there is no tangible
reason for the “riot" or that
there is nothing to crusade ior

There is notlu'ng that looks

freshman, tagging along he~
inrl an nppcrclassman in one
of these “riots," who has no
idea of what he‘s doing or
why he's doing it.

In London they climb around
on buildings and hang up witty
signs in Berlin they riot against
Communist rule. In Paris they
challenge some govenment or
other. But in Grinnell they mill
noisily around, destroy a little
property, set oft some ﬁrecrackr
ers, and in doing so, run the
risk of losing privileges that it
has taken a lot of patient work
to gain. And they don’t frighten
anyone except me; rm afraid the
trustees might decide to turn
Grinnell into a girl’s school.
