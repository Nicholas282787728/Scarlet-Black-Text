However, since lhcre was no

convu‘l‘lllﬂn last year, the tradi~
lion was not continued.

This your the candidates are

not planning to visit the ‘ELmSl

hut will meet in a room sonic-
u-hcre on campus and listen to
the convention on KGRW as the
candidates did in 1953 and lost
it would seem the Three Elins

tradition is about. to pass Item

will be revived, however, for
