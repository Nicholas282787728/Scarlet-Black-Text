Tension has a variety of causes.

make you tense all over. Con-
stant irritations such 21: noise

people chattering can create
tensencss. Tension can also be
caused by boredom, resentment
or continued excitement.

The iirst step in releasing
tension, according to Scott,
is to and out what is making

best to remove the cause. Those
things that you Can’t avoid
you may be ahle to ignore,

Physically, you can 'releasc
tension by relaxing your mus»

can be recognized by llexing
