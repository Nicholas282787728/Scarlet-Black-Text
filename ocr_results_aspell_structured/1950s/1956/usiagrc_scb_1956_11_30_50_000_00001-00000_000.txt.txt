The Robert Geoffrey Thea-

of the women’s social fee.

The special project, usually a
concert performance for the
entire college, has been select-

felt that the women would en-
joy something on this order in
addition to the regular Concert
Series. Last year the Chanti-
Cleers were selected as the
special event. The year before
Richard Dyer Bennett Was con-
tracted.

During the summer the an

tec contracted the dancers. In
a mass meeting this fall the
women approved the social
budget for the first semester
of 1956.57 which included 5200

Several ideas have already been
presented such as a television
set, more intra»dorm parties, a

Week, a guest speaker, a style
show and other projects which
would benefit all the women
