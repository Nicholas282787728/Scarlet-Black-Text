Far From

Customary
Skies

By Gene Thompson

In the basement of James Hall
there is a poorly—lit, poorly»
heated and very poorly-ventil-
ated room that looks. except for
lack of spittoons on the floor,
like the back room of a Bowery
beer—joint. Fill it with cigarette
smoke, throw some refuse on the
floor, and it could pass for a
gin mill of the 1920’s. 0r fill it
with packing cases and it
could pass for a warehouse on
Chicago's East River. It is suit-
ed for any activity except the
activity for which it is meant.

This is the room laughingly
referred to as the “study hall"
—a ridiculous, ineffective and
somewhat oldrfashioned method
of punishment for South Campus
rule-breakers. Women students
are confined to this room for
such offenses as being late at
“hours" (one evening for every
minute after the hour) and for
forgetting to “sign out." It is
used as a threat to force mem—
bers of a hall to show up for in-
tramural events like Fetzer sing
practice. Women on academic
probation are automatically sub
jected to its discomforts.

The inmates of the study
hall must sit up straight in
old wooden booths arranged
around the brick wall. They
are not allowed to smoke,
chew gum, knit, talk or fall
asleep. They cannot write let~
tel-s. They must study from
books. No typewriter, of
course, can be used. A moni-
tor-member of the League
Board enforces these condi-
tions.

in the eyes of a great many
Women students, the “study hall"
is hated and feared. It is a type
of enforced study discipline that
many of them resent.

On the other hand, complete
quiet in a South Campus hall is
often very hard to find, and
many girls use the study hall of
their own free will when finals
are getting too close for com-
fol-t.

But the spirit in which till
“study hall" is used as a pun-
ishment ior rule-breakers, and
especially as a penalty for
those who don’t participate in
intramural activities, seems to
me to be contrary to the col-
lege’s present policy on rules.
The element of punishment in-
volvcd reminds me of the high
school Situation—it allows for
no recognition of any sort of
maturity on the part 0‘ the
oflender.

And it's obvious that the pun-
ishment doesn‘t fit the crime in
any way. Many girls have won-
dered why they were being sub
jected to enforced study because
they forgot to “Sign out" or

Tune: “when You came To
The End 01 A Perfect Day”

(slightly of! key.) ,

It is hardly my place to sum
up the year‘s activities, \but the
year is coming to a close and I
probably should say something.
Rather than review the changes
which Ken Kassebaum effected
I would like to give you some
idea as to what may be expect-
ed in the coming year.

1) The Student Council will
include social chairmen in its
open meetings.

2) student government will
inform the new students dur-
ing the summer of the go

Corner

ernmental system here. .

3) The Student Council will
make at least one trip to Lake
Acre to glean suggestions for
development. These suggestions
will be turned over to Mr. Si-
mane.

4) The Student Council will
continue to carry your opinions
to the Administration and {ac-
ulty. (See council report in
this week‘s paper.)

5) The Student Council will
invite freshmen to meetings to
acquaint them with Student
Government.

At this point, i should prob-
ably offer an alternate sugges-
tion as to some sort of punish-
ment. The only thing i can think
of is a fine, which probably
wouldn’t do the trick. But may-
be something could he found that
wouldn‘t make James basement
