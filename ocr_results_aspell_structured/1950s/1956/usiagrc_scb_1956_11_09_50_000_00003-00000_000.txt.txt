twice and spell defeat for the
Gas team, The first conversion
was after a blocked punt and
the second came on a pass from
Adcock to Dave Van Anrooy.

0n offense Adoock, a gradu-
ate of Roosevelt high school
in Des Moines, made good use
at his passing arm, completing
nine tosses, and directed his
team well in their second vic-
tory, His principal receivers
were Van Anrooy and rangy
Howie 0hline who scored the
second TD lor the Pioneers
Ohline seemed unusually adept
at snagging the pigskin under
the most adverse of conditions.

in the back field also little
and Bruce
Taylor, both halfbacks, were
the men whose running ability
seemed to baffle the Cue defense.
Wioto, another halfback, con
tributed his bit to the reception
of Adcock's passes. one of which
he scored on in the first period.

In the line tackles Richard
Yaki and Ken Pap turned in
asterling perlormance on both
oiiense and deiensc. Guard
Roy Simpson, n sixty—minute
man in both lrosh games, was
another bright spot in the line
along with center Roger Smith.

Lineman Bud nutse has also
played hang-up ball this sea»
son but was hindered by an
injury against Coe.

Dave Allen, who captained
the team along with Pap and

'Yakl, was a constant inspiration

to the men on the field and
more than once stopped a Coe
drive with his murderous tack—
ling.

In a college sportsletter fresh-
man coach John Pfitsch said,
"Let me say that I thought our
kids did a magnificent job, as
we played with only a fourteen
man total in each game."
