Ql’tﬂl'ﬁ

To the Editor:

Relei'l in- to the article in
last weeks some concerning the
service lee retund and why
there aren't gomg to be refunds
until the lust ot November:
Whi- didnt wé get the refunds
this summerv Because of the
worker shortage, And even now
while many Grinnell students
are looking for more work hours
because of the 5 hollrS-a-week
limit. the ottice still can't get
the elietl~~ out until the first oi
Novembct

What we wondering is why
they don‘t hire the students that
want work to get the $10 ser-
vice deposits back to everybody”
Just a question,
