Students Arrange “Freshman Showcase Provides Coed TV‘WaIching
Wor’rhwhile Thea'l'er Evening

By Susan Borne
A small but courageous group of Grinnell theater-goers
was caught in the act of seeing the first of two perform-
anoes'of Freshman Showcase last night, and was rewarded,
quite incidentally, with a most Worthwhile evening of the—

The purpose of such projects

prospect of a “workshop produc-
tion" they were privileged to be
part of a select audience. A very
successful presentation was kept
almost, but not quite under
cover.

Four scenes from the middle
of “A Streetcar Named Desire"
were given last night: antece—
dent action was described ader
quately. Possibly the scenes to-
night from “The Glass Menag~

Smoke" will make a less effec-
tive unit; but those who go will
not be disappointed.

On its own terms, the pro
duction is excellent. Originally
set up two years ago to give all
interested freshmen a chance to
appear on the Grinnell stage, it
accomplishes this goall

The interested ones were
not forced to compete against
veterans of many productions,
and they are allowed to dem-
onstrate their ability to a di-
rector and an audience after
considerable preparation and
thought, instead of under the
pressures of a session of try-
outs. Certainly this is all good,
and it is more than likely that
the Grinnell audience will

performers under conditions
of a full—scale production

As onefourth of this year’s
“major production" schedule,
however, “An Evening with
Tennessee Williams” is disap-
pointing. Not enough people
will have seen it: the low seat<
ing capacity of Arena theater
coupled with inadequate ad-
vance publicity seems to imply
that the drama department and
Grinnell Players hoped to ac-
tually discourage attendance .by
putting it out of reach of all hut
the most devoted and best in
formed of students

Thus, what might appear to
be unfavorable circumstances in-
crease the effectiveness of the
presentation: the intimacy of
Arena and the flexibility of
theaterrinrthe-round. combined
with a sympathetic audience, are
ideal conditions for this type of
production.

But no specific attempt was
made to provide an evening of
entertainment for the view—
:15. This was an incidental
result. Any stage presentation
must be directed toward an
audience: no production is a
more exercise to benefit the
players.

True, an attempt was made
(and it was successful) to “share
the problems of the director and
the actors with the audience,"
