Russians Here? .

Do we want Russians at

Grinnell? The students seem

to think so; they voted overwhelmingly in favor of a plan

to submit Grinnell‘s name to

the State Department as a

school interested in a student exchange plan with Russia.
And, judging by the comments made at the coffee hour,

the plan will probably have

the support of tile faculty. In

our opinion, such a plan can not start soon enough.’
The iron curtain is certainly not one-sided, It is im-

portant for Americans to remember

this; too often we are

content to let ourselves accept stereotyped concepts of the

Rﬁssian people. When the Russian

farmers v1 ted Iowa~

last summer, 3,000 people gathered at the airport in Des
Moines to greet them. There was an element of disappoint—

' ment in the air when the 12

men stepped off the plane.

Any one of them easily could have been‘mistaken for an

Iowa farmer,

Of course,

the same principles of misinterpretation

are true in reverse And, in the total scheme of things, the
exchange would probably not help to Wipe 0th yearsof cold
war, hate and mistrust. But, Grinnell would derive im-

measurable' benefit from
another way of life. The intell

contact

with students from
ectual stimulation from asso-

ciation with students who sincerely disagree with our sys-
tem, and thediscovery that Russians are, after all, human

beings would be invaluable.

On the other hand, the Grinn lian who spent a year

in Russia would really have a

to us that both sides would benefit‘from ‘
Department will see its way clear to

hope that the State

At the beginning of each se-
lnlester the Student Council re-
ceives some $4,000 from the sem
fee to distribute among various
campus organiz tions. These ﬁrs
ganizations submit budgets
which are discussed by the Cen-
tral Committee. The Committee
then agrees on a sufficient bud-
get which these groups operate.

This semester the Council 31‘
lofted money to the 5&8, 'KG-
RW, Student Auditor and the
Student Musical. In addition we
were able to allot money to Lake
Acre and finance the Four
Freshmen Concert,

It is through Your Student
Council that these things are
made available to you each se-
mesler.

Far From

Customary
Skies

By Gene Thompson

The other night my friend
Peter Moals received a new
shipment of goodies from home,
and of Course my first thought
(aiter I had finished studying
in a Health Education test)
was to head for his room. When
i turned the knob of his door, 1
found that it was locked, but i
knew he wouldn't be sacked out
or anything because he's a his
tory major With an IQ, of two
hundred and seven, and he never
goes to bed until three. It was a
puzzle. 1 could hear little sounds
of paper crinkilng ﬁl'om'inside,
It wasn’t like Peter to keep those
goodies all to himself, so i kick-
ed the bottom of his door imr
patiently, until he .opened it.
There wasn’t a goodie in sight.

"Okay,” 1 said, giving him one
of my knowing glances, “Where
are those goodes?”

“Had to hide themv" he said,
“just wait a minute." He drag-
ged a large cardboard box
from behind his desk. It was »
the size’ and shape oi a case
of beer. ms'lle were hundreds
of cookies and donuts of as-
sorted sizes—big ones, little
ones, {at ones and thin ones.

“Wow!" I exclaimed, ”I’ll ad-
mit it‘s a gold mine of goodies,
but why lock the door?" He.
didn’t answer, but just handed
me a donut, smiling. I took it
and ate it, smiling back. i sound
that they were deliciously flavA .
ored with some alcoholic bever- ,-
ageerum. i think it was. “I get,
it! The drinking rule!”

"Well not exactly," he an—
swered, ”but the alcohol con—
tent is over three-point two, and
Mom might have violated a state
law or something."

“I see," I replied thought-
fully, my mouth full of rum-
ﬂnvared donut. I had eaten
{our of them by this lime.
Then We heard someone com-

ing down the hall, so Peter hid
the goodies. Just as he unlocked
the door, it opened and George
(”iron Man") Mm‘Wn, varsity
football player and ﬁzz-ed major,
came in. He was clad in some
Did pajama bottoms with little
pictures of footballs, baseballs,
basketballs and tennis racqueis
on them. He also wore a dirty
tee»shirt, which he raised now
and then so he could scratch his
tummy.

Now all of us boys wear a}
dirty teershirt now and then,
and some of us even scratch our
tummles, butFeter Moats didn't
like Morton because he was one
of those guys who sits around
the tables in the Student Union
lounge and watches people dance.

Morton wanted to see me,
‘ he Said about our Health Edu-
caton test the next day. He
