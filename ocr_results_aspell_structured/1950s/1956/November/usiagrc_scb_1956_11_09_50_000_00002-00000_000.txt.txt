Prepping

Men‘s prepping ends with hell night tomorrow. After
six weeks of entertaining upperclassmen, freshmen finally
will be able to act as college students '

”The prepping program is established . . . for the pure
pose of developing in the freshmen 2t spirit of the tradition
of Grinnell and an understanding of the rights and duties
of a Grinneilian.” This is according to the statement issued in
the C of HP’s ”Handbook for Men.” After analyzing the
statement, we do not feel that prepping fulfills this purpose.

What does "the tradition of Grinneli” mean“.7 Does it
mean that freshmen must entertain upperclassmen at house~
meeting by offering themselves to the mercy of their so
called hail—brothers? Does tradition stand for making a spec—

We think that these rights and duties also include

of the college, and lending the college the student's talents.
If this is true, prepping doesn‘t constructively promote this.
It momentarily delays these rights and duties.

The average hall member would say that prepping’s
purpose is to integrate freshmen into their residence halls.

It is our contention

that prepping is only successful for

those ,who don’t need it. The outgoing, personable man will
have fun with prepping. However, he will become integrated

1 went through the Student

bably the first time that the
files have been thoroughly ex-
amined in many years. The file
cabinet was filled with an al»
most unbelievable accumulation
of trash.

In some respects the file cab-
inet is representative of the so.
At times it seems that the Coun-

Why would anyone keep a let

historical interest? (it should be

Now is the time for me to do
the same thing with regard to

just can‘t slip back into the old
rut. If they do, God help my
successor. rll promise you new,

Capila/ Commentary

By Lynn Parsons and
Tom Skornia

(This could appropriately be
titled “A Poem of Solace lo the
Democratic Party,” or “Take
Heart, my Dems, the Cause is
Not Lost.” if this column, writ-v
ten on election eve, is proved
wrong, our blushes will not
match our elation at being able
to attend President Stevenson's.
inaugural. Usually we try not
to be this partisan, but this
week we couldn’t help it.
Apologies.)

The defeat last Tuesday of
the Democratic presidential csnv
didate will no doubt be inter-
preted as a Resounding Affirma-
tion of the Principles of the
Republican Party and a Severe
Blow to the Democratic Party’s
Collectivist Welfare state, or
some such catchword by the
faithful parrots of the GOP line.

However. without adopting
too much of a sour grapes at-
titude toward the whole thing,
we would like to put forth l
the assertion that the last two 1
presidential elections have, in
a way, uncovered the greatest
victory the Democrats ever
could have won.

why dc we say this? Take a.
look (if you are still reading)
at the GOP platform this year.
In it. you find the vigorous en-
dorsement of such things as so—,
