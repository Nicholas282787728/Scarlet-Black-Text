“Groggy Gridders" lose To Vikings;
last Period Touchdown Breaks lie

The Grinnell Gridders still
groggy from the 2570 defeat by
Coe, received their second loss
of the season from the Law-
rence Vikings to the tune of
14.7.

The relentless ground at-
tacks by the Lawrence eleven
seemed too much for the Pio~
neers, as yard after yard was
gained by the vikings.

Coach Bob Peterson, when
asked what the problem was
concerning last week’s game,
stated, “There was no problem.
We just ran up against a bet»
ter teamr”

Although the team lost, there
were many exciting moments
in the home opener, for after
tying the score in the second
quarter, the Lawrence Vikings
were held scoreless until the
last quarter.

The freshmen class, witness-
ing their first gridiron battle

as Grinnellians, were very en-
thusiastic during the game, At
half time the preps formed a
cheering line to spirit the
players as they rc-entercd the
field. \

Peterson was asked how be
though the varsity would do
against Ripon Saturday. “I don’t
know. I do know though that
Ripon beat Coe and Coe beat
US."

if spirit is any indication as
to what the Grinnell varsity
will do tomorrow, then it
should be an exciting ball
game at ltipon. "The fellas on
the squad are really fired up
this week," said Gary Nolder,
team member who has been
sidelined because of injuries.

Defense practice was predom~
inant in the scrimmage against
the freshmen team on Wednes-
day. Reports have it that Ripol-l
is a strong team offensively,
