Open Letter to Irwin Li Simone

Dear Irv,
Last Friday you were the sub-

jecl; of an unfair letter to the
editor of this newspaper. The
letter was submitted by one of
our members who thought that
he was acting in complete ac—
cord with the rest of the group
but lound later that he was not.
The blame however is not his.

The purpose of this letter is
to try to undo some of the harm
that was thoughtlessly done you;
of course it will not undo the
harm but perhaps we will feel
bctter it the attempt is made,
hollow though it may sound. It
is sincere.

We suppose it will not help
to say tliatltlie Black Friars
has always been an inrormal
“jag" outlit, and that the
group has never before been
taken so seriously. Last week’s
letter was not intended ser-
ionsly. but unfortunately it
was taken as such by your

friends and by ours.

There were trivial and sec-
ondhand complaints about you,
true, but the letter arose out of
them only in a small way. More
it was an attempt to needle
someonc a little to stir
something up. It was never
dreamed that it would be taken
seriously, we repeat, it was
thought that it might even be
funny.

But when we saw thc paper

' we realized that it was not funr
‘ ny. Perhaps had the lone not

been so Vicious it would have
SCCnlcd less an indictment and
moru of a “College prank.” hidz

 

colts as those words are.

Altogether, it was a grave
error in judgment. innocent,
but grave. As a group we
feel we owe you an apology
for such an unreasonable and
unfounded blast, Had the
tone been different, or had
there been some specific com-
plaint, perhaps all would have
seemed hirer.

We feel that there '
room for healthy cl
that the sort of criticism we
levelled at you last week is only
destructive.

Again. we icel bad about it,
we are sorry it happened, we
have learned a great deal from
the experience, and we have a
new respect for you, the things
you have accomplished. and tar
your many iricnds who have
been quick to point out our
thoughtlessness. Nccdlcss to say,
the writer or the letter feels es-
pecially awkward, and is per.
haps more to blame than any of
the others.

We are especially sorry that
members oi the entire athletic
department took the poorly”
worded letter as in indictment
oi them. of the Honor G, or oi
any athletic team or member.
Such was not the intention.

Lastly, in spite of any ex»
planatioii which we have made,
there are still some individuals
and groups bringing injurious
pressure against our members;
some or whom hold responsible
campus positions._ Because of
this we are forced to disband
our organization at least tor the
remainder of the year.

Sincerely,
The Black Friars

To the Editor:
1 read with a mixture of
amused tolerance and some in—
dignation, the letter of
Black Liars, or whatever the
organization calls itseli, supp-35v
edly condemning Irv Simone.

Amused tolerance became
such a shady organization mill-:i
be so incredibly simple as
believe that their confiden-
and approval is somnthing to be
desired on campus, and indigna—
tion that this group could be
allowed to make venomuus and
frustrated implications ag. «st .
respected campus oriicial.

In an attempt to open t -
eyes of your readers to the
truth about lrv Simone, I
have been requested by the
captains oi the various spo
teams on campus to as
that they hold lrv Simone 1
high estimation and respect,
and that their conﬁdence "1
him has never DEE“ highlix’
than at present,

1 myself am particularly con—
scious of the tremendous com
tribution that Simone has madc
to thc Grinncll campus by his
conception, development and
publicizing of the Lake Aci-
project, and have been ama
by the ungratotul attacks or i.—
rcspollslble students and a
campus leaders.

it would appear that, having
been opposed in their demai
for unrealistic concessions Suv‘
as the abandoning of a cllm\»
out system ior boats, th
ple have resarted to vi
and personal attacks,
the tact that they have shown
thcmsclves neglecttul in iesprns
sibilities as small as Supplyi’ig

Simone, whether or not be

pus Social committee,
most likely still he held
sponsiblo tor anything riiio
tuiiate that might liap
there, and I can see h
tive in saieguarding
by reti’ning some measure of
supervision oi the proicct.

The Black Friars are now
trying to case out of the cans
tempt that they have brought
on themselves by accre ‘iing the
letter to one unlorluiiatc mem-
ber, but my personal opinion s
that any organization w"
cannot restrain such an o itbu t

by expulsion or disctplmaly
measures, is in a sad state. pals
