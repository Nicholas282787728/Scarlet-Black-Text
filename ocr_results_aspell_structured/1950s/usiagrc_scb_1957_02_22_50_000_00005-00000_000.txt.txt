THE LOUSE

He strolled through a keyhole into my house,
A dignified, Well-bred upper-class louse:
He smiled in a most supeﬁor way
And said, “Man has just about seen his day.
If you’ll take my advice for what it’s worth
Treat insects nice, they'll inherit the earth!
Try to be beyond reproach
In you: dealings with the roach l . .
Bedbugs, ants and spiders, too.
Don’t forget . . i WE’RE WATCHING YOU!”

MORAL: Well until Louie takes
over, take your pleasure BIG. Smoke

Packed more smoothly by
