Basketball In The Rough.
Swimmers Vs. Wrestlers

by null Pothoven

Spectators at next Thursday’s
basketball contest between Grin—
nell and North Central will be
treated to an interesting if
somewhat gruesome halftime
“spectacle". It seems that the
Pioneer wrestling squad sudden-
ly acquired some grace and
challenged the swimmers to a
basketball contest.

The game will consist of two
four minute halves and will be
the culmination of a long stand-

‘ ing argument between the two

squads as to which is composed
of the superior athletes. The
grapplers favored a more
brawny sport such as a free
for all, no holds barred, while
the swimmers held out for wa~
tar polo.

Needless to say neither would
accept the other‘s proposal and
after much arbitration some

genius suggested basketball.
This was eagerly grabbed by
both outfits and practice ses-
sions were begun by the wrest-
lers, who diligently slip out
from under Coach Peterson’s
watchful eye during practice to
go upstairs and ﬂip a basketball
around Swimming coach si-
mone even relaxed his no bas—
ketball rule and has arranged
for a secret practice to be held
in the Monmouth gym next
Wednesday.

Both coaches are being very
secretive as to their starting
lineups but in a private inter-
view with a certain moosey
wrestler this reporter did diSe
cover that the matmen plan to
use a full court press with a
zone defense and fast break. If
they can figure out. a way to
do this John Pfitsch would like
to have a private demonerae
tion for his cagers. As he flexedl
his enormous muscles my i ,
formant also slyly mentioned
that no team ever had as manyl
hatchet men as his does.

All that can be found out

about the swimmers is that they_ -

plan on using a two platoon
system but rumor has it that
something “fishy" is being plane
ned.

Tough Meets

After a successful debut in the
Knox Relays, Coach Irv Simone’s
swnnnnng squad is pointing to
tollloi‘l'ow’s Nebraska 11, meet.
This is one of the two meets left
before vacation and the Pioneers
will be going all out to ’avenge
one of their two defeats of last
year. Next Wednesday the squad
will travel to Monmouth to en»
gage the Scots in a dual meet.
Tomorrow's meet will give
Grinncll fans their oportunity to
action. Sir
mone will use all of the men on
his varsity in the meet. These are
the same ones that finished no
lower than second in any event
at Knox.

Top threats for Grinnell will

include co-captain Joel stubbs in
the sprint events and Wally
Bragdon in the backstroke and
indiVidual medley. Diver, John
Pike, who showed that he ls
rounding into rorm last week,
also could very easily pick up a
first place,

Behind thcsc three will be one
captain Toni Hejna in the back-
stroke and Howie Runyzm in the
medley and sprints, Veteran dis»
tance man‘ Doug Banister can
always be counted on for points
in the more gruelling races as
can Chuck McKay in the breast—

Nebraska Perenniaily Strong

Simone has not yet decided as
to what events each man will
enter since he does not have to
much indication of Nebraska’s
strength. The Cornhuskers
strength appears to be Jerry
Bentz in the distance races and
medley and Jack Reed in the
backstroke. Aside from these
two little is known about the
Pioneer's opponents, except that
they will be strong as usual.

Against Monmouth the lineup
may be juggled a little since the
Scots are lacking in power and
it is a good chance for Simone
to experiment with his squad.
Monmouth's particular forte
seems to be the breatstroke but
even here the Pioneers stack up
well against them.

Two lrirsts at Knox

Last Saturday the pioneers
took two firsts and five seconds
at Knox. Backstrokers Hejna,
Bragdon and Marsh splashed
their way home in the zoo back-
stroke relay as did Runyan.
Hejnn and Bragdon in the 225
individual medley relay.

Runnerup spots were captured
by both the son and 400 free.
style teams, the soo medley
crew and the bi-eaststrokers. 1n
the only individual event pike
took second in diving and Stotts
seventh, Pike’s total was.second
only to Fleming, the loop chain»
pion from Knox.
