Report on Dean's List Shows
Culling Doesn't AHec’r Grade

by Jeanne Bannister

Class attendance does not seem to affect grades much.
At least, that is what a report on the use of the unlimited

cut privilege by students on the
indicate.

Dean’s list last semester would

Forty-nine students, 23 men and 21 women, were on last
semester’s Dean‘s list. Use of cuts ranged from zero to 64, and

grades Irom 2.93 to 4.0.

There did not seem to be any
correlation between cuts and
grades, though. Only iour of
the 15 not retained on the list,
this semester cut more than 15;
times. Three of the 12 who cutl
more than 15 times had 4.0 av»
erages. The lowest grade average
of those taking advantage of the
unlimited cuts was 3.0.

The report also shows that
women hold the records for
the largest number or heav-
eragcs, the most cuts, and the
lowest grade. Men hold one
record: best attendance.

A perfect attendance record
is held by a man who had a 3.94
average. The total number of
cuts taken by men was 356, an
average of 12.71 apiece. The av-‘
erage grade for men on the
Dean's list was about 3.6. l

A woman with a 3.0 average
led the field in the number of
cuts taken with 54. A total oi
295 cuts were taken by wo-
men, or an average of 14.05
cuts each. 3.69 was the average
grade for women on the list.

The woman with the best at-
tendance record, one cut, had
a 4.0 average. The highest num-.
ber of cuts taken by a man was,
35. He had a 3.6 average.
Thirty-iollr members or last
semester's Dean's list were
among the as who made it
this semester. or the 15, 10
men and 5 women, who were
dropped irom the list, only
four, three men and one wo-
man, cut more than 15 classes.
