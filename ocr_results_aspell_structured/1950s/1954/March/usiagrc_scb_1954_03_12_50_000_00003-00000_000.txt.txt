Candidates' Backers

Arveson

During this campaign one has
heard over and over again the
complaint that all of the plat~
forms of the various candidates
zrethesalne.1lhisis,inour
opinion, complete nonsense.
There is a vital difference 'be-
tw‘een «he candidates and their
platforms.

It does not seem too much to
say that the rare or llhe new
student constitution is all, stake
in {his election. N‘ext year’s
President of the Student Council
will be Mmible for guiding
it no Wleﬁon It is fm- nus
reason that we support Kitten

We are supporting Dick “Tl‘

G’rilnnell the Way it is.

Hansen wants to wipe out

start a paper drive. For llhese
reasons, we support “Tiger"l

Dick Von Maur

Harrison

You have seen during lhe past
week the real lssues that con-
1mm all of us

1. AL the prescm time Student
Government at Grumell is en-
urely inefficient and inadequate
to fulfill she needs or the
students.

2. There must be a sigmicant
change in our structure of Stud-
and Government .in hhe near fu-
ture,

3. If the new proposed Con»
smunon does not pass, more

 

must be a clear (rut set of all-
ternat‘ives that can be imple-
merited.

4. There must be no cumpm-
mise on llhe basic principles on
which the new Constitution is
based. These are: student a:—
ta'us in student hands, and clear
cut areas of smudenl responsr
lblljlty based on a lbelie! in the
capabilities of stud‘enrs.

To guaranlee uhe continuation
or converted eLton ward these
ends we must have a president
who has the Iollowing qualifica—
lions:

1. Independence; The President.
or Grlmuell's student body must
not lbe beholden to any special
interests or pressure groups, but
must work for all.

2. Objectivit ; he must be will-
ing to look into all sides or a
difficult situation and then to
support lhc student 'point of
View with conce'l'zed effort.

a. Ahully; he must have the
ability to uhink clearly, act de-
usively. and m organize and
carry cult a program based on
acuon rather than apalihy.

We reel that mhe candidate
who most wholeheartedly cm-
bodies mesa 'princilpla and:
qualiﬁcations for she ofﬁce a:
Student Council President ls Al-

 

 

 

len Harrison. By supporting
him, G’rinnell students will in-
sure rho fulure of student gov-
ernment at Grilmall.

Ryan

We are backing Nick Ryan lor
Student Council President be-
cause we sincerely feel mat he
(has ﬁne ambition mad initiative
to guide and lead the student
body toward higher goals and
5011113 of self-direction.

Nick has a deep insight inmo
students' opinions anal desires
and has the ability to express
and mobilize “use into Eﬁmcﬁve
action. By directing our srudeue
rgovenmlenlt, Nick would DOOl“
dlnate and motivalle student,
faculty. and Nutritive
groups with ﬁnesse, sax/corny
and salgalcily.

We feel that his supposed lack
of experience is lar out-weighed
by his eagerness and honesty of
pmvpose.

Therefore, we believe mat
Nick Ryan has more shan ample
qualiﬁcations to represent Grin-
nell students a Student Coun-
cil President.
