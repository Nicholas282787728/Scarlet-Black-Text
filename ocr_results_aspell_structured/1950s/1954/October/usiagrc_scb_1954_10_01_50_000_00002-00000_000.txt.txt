The right to vote is a precious one. Tile number of peo-
ple who possess it grows smaller with each irony curtain
call. Much talk is heard about the abuse of the voting priVl
lege. The worst abuse of it is not to take advantage of it. '

,_ College cynicism, particularly the political variety is
becoming tiresome. Your vote is worthwhile even if choos-

ing the lesser of two evils.

The “what's the use” attitude is unforgivable. What’s
the use of maintaining a denlocl‘atic'form 91" government if
you don‘t vote?

The “I haven’t got time to bother with all the red
tape” attitude is even more prominent and less excusable.
Adjacent to this editorial is a story telling you how you can
register hy‘mail and obtain your absentee ballot. It’s not
too late.

The 4th Estate Celebrates

Starting today and continuing to October 8 ‘will be,

national newspaper week in the United States. Generally
we have little sympathy with Special weeks. We just
couldn’t get very excited about Dill Pickle Week, Home
Canning Week, or even Return to School Week. However,
this time we succumb. We’re part of the herd and we’re
kind of proud of it since 1954 marks the 85th birthday of
the Scarlet and Black.

We’d like to thank Ml”. Ls B. Watt, the publisher of the
Grinnell Herald-Register, for inviting everyone to attend a
special free film titled ”It Happens Every Thursday", which
will be shown twice a night on Tuesday and Wednesday at
the Strand theatre.

We'd also like to say that he is throwing an open house
down at the Herald~Register so that those who are inter»
ested can see the actual procedure of putting out a neus-
paper.

From 6 pm, to 10 pm. Wednesday night, the presses, ‘

linotype machines and typewriters will be clicking and mem—

Joe‘s talent for cooking the best,

Grinncll students.

Back in 1940, at work in his
shoe shop, several college stur

he would cook Italian spaghetti
for a hall party at the Country
club. After trying lo figure a
way to cook for sixty people, he
finally camc up with an idea. If
the college would cook the spa-
ghetti, Joe would cook his fa-
mous sauce and fix the rest of
the meal.
