Three Professors Wri’re
Books Slalecl For Publica’rion

Three faculty members whose
manuscripts have recently been
accepted for publication are
John Burma (sociology), Charles
Easter (English), and Joseph
Wall (history).

“Racial Minorities in Amer-
led," by Burma, will be pub-
lished by Doubleday early in
1955. Burma also announced
that a “Workbook in introduc—
tory Sociology,” which he de-
veloped in collaboration with
Marshon DePoister (tormerly of
the sociology department), will
be published by Prentiss Hall
next January.

Faster‘s book, “The Rungless
Ladder: Harriet Beecher Stowe
and New England Puritanism."
will be published by Duke uni~
versity press on December 1.

Oxford university press has
accepted Wall’s “Henry Wetter-
son: Reconstructed Rebel," but
the date of publication has not
been decided yet.

“Racial Minorities in Amer-
ica," one of a series of 20 books
under the general title, “Short
Studies in Sociology,” deals
with racial prejudices and the
problems of minority groups.
The book, which is primarily
descriptive and analytical in
style, is designed to replace
either a sociology text or a
readings book at-the undergrad»
uate level.

Burma and EtePoister's work-
book is designed for use in in—
troductory sociology classes in
conjunction with any of six ma—

in: texts and

"The Rungless Ladder" incor-
porates a detailed study of Hal-

eight readings

riet Beecher Stowe's most im-'

portant novels with material on
the author herself.

The book is expected to in.
terest a variety of other read-
ers besides specialists in Ameri-
can literature, history and re—
ligious life.

Referring to “Henry Natter—
son: Reconstructed Rebel” as a
trade book, Wall said that his
book will have its greatest ap-
peal for journalists, largely be.
cause Watterson was a famous
editor.

Watterson founded the Louis.
ville, Ky., Courier-Journal in
1868 and served as its editor
until 1919. His chief aim was
the reconciliation of the North
and South after the Civil War.)

Wall stated, "inasmuch as it
has political significance in deal-
ing with the decades between
the Civil War and World War
1, 1 am hoping that it will also
have some appeal for the gen-
eral public."

TERESA WRIGHT says.- “Up to 16, my knowledge of acting
had been gleaned from seeing movies. When 1 saw my ﬁrst
professional play, that was it: x only wanted to act. I got into
high school plays, wrestled props at Provincetown, understudied,
sat for months in producers' reception rooms. One rainy
night, sick with a cold, I read for a good role, and got it!”
