Are Dirty Noses Needed? _

A bold and novel plan for Grinnell pioneering in edu-
cation has been bluesprinted. .

This week President Samuel N. Stevens outlined his
answer; drawn up long before the question was put to
him, as to the best means to train college students for
real-life politics out in the cold, cruel world. In answer to‘
a group of college officials being formed this month to
further student interest in politics, President Stevens has
a belief and a plan. '

“You don’t learn politics in theory; you have to get
your nose dirty," he said this week, going ahead to explain
that he and Dr. Joseph Dunner (political science) have
drawn up plans for an “Institute of Creative Citizenship,"
which would make students actual observers and perform-
ers in city, county and state government while in college.

The proposal calls for part-time “internships", perhaps
as research men for state senators and the like, with stu—
dents being paid for their work.

The blueprints are currently before three foundations
who are being asked for $25,000 for five years to put the
project into effect. President Stevens said that it will
probably cost $15,000 a year in full swing so money is the
problem. If and when a foundation will advance support is
still guesswork.

It’s an excellent idea. Let’s hope it goes through. But
if I didn‘t believe I could learn anything by study on a
theoretical basis I wouldn’t be in college. It's not yet time
to throw the books out the window.

Children Must Play But-1‘-

My anthropology book says that college prolongs in-
fancy. Infancy or no, the turning in of false fire alarms are
not the only instance where Grinnell student behavior ap
proaches criminal proportions.

The manager of the Grinnell telephone exchange had
the pay phone on Cowles first removed this week. Its pa<
trons had cheated the phone company out of $39.15 dur-
ing March alone, his records showed. More than one coin
with a string attached was recovered in the coin box.

I’m beginning to understand why a train conductor is
reported to have said that he‘d rather have a whole train-
loald of passengers from S. U. I. than one carload of Grin- .
nelians.

PROMINENT

among the

MOURNERS

by Carl itungc

(Note: This week, while the
rest of next year’s see staff
and l put out this issue of the
sets by ourselves, Mr. Herman
c. Runge is guest mourner.
-—Ed Laing)

spring this year was ushered
in by one of those unfortunate
incidents that freshmen have
never heard about and never
seen. l
THIS WAS THE Tl-lLRD
FALSE ALARM TURNED IN,
lN THREE YEARS AND AL-
MOST RESULTED lN THE
LOSS or FIRE PROTECTION
FOR THE COLLEGE. Few of
us realize the magnitude of the

i
l

ed by a volunteer fire depart-
ment. Men all over the com-
munity being awakened to pen
form a civil service and obliga-
tion, a hazardous traffic situa-
tion created in the downtown
area, and widespread organized=
confusion are just a few of the‘
results of such a “big joke."

This brings to mind the time
that a member of the local,
constabulary was struck by a
car at a previous “miscarriage
of humor" of the same tylpe.

We would do well to project
ourselves far enough into the
future to see the day when the
cry “wolf" from the roof-tops,
will go unheeded and a icw‘
sheep get burned because the
shepherd rolled over and pulled
the pillow over his head.

I’m for spring, rm for fun,l
I’m for beer and blankets but
let's not lose sight of the elasJ
tic limit.

It's interesting to note the
way we can be served french:
fried onions one day and sticky
white noodles, “cleverly con.
cealed with cheese", the next.
Pei-hops Pershing and Eisen-l
hower ought to join hands in
the middle of the road. ‘

. . .

 

Another Grinnell lirst. it
took the buildings and grounds
dept, less than a week to act
after the conception of the
idea to put in mines around
the horseshoe stakes. Now its
almost like studying to the
music of French bells! ‘
. . .

Also in the local color de-
partment, l have noticed that
many of those who were friend-
less before, and now hnvc cars,
find the number of their friends
is directly proportional to the
number of seats in the convey-
ance. Some call it a phenomen-
on of nature; my only comment
is, Henry, deliver us from
busses.

Don't know who’s dropping
the bombs, lbut ‘l have it that iif‘
it doesn’t step the local citizen-
ry may goad someone into a,
general Search. HIDE THOSE
GOODIES!

guson said the man struck
him once, knocking him to
the ground.

Police chic: Waldo Johnson
told the 53:13 the police took
Robert Criswell into custody
immediately alter the incident,
and Ferguson subsequently filed
an information against Criswell
which led to an assault and bat»
tery charge. Criswell is not a
member of the fire department.

Ferguson told the salts he re-
ceived an internal lip laceration,
a slight concussion, and three
chipped teeth as a result of the
incident.

City Rejects Money "‘

The c of HP voted this week
to contribute $5 from each of
the nine men‘s halls to the city
for the false alarm costs, but
the money was declined. Fire
Chief Taylor told the S&B that
the city deeply appreciated the
gesture, but would not accept
the money. In answer to a ques-
tion concerning the cost per
fire call he said that it was
about $100.

Dean of Men Henry Brown
told the site that he received
a call informing him of a dis—
turbance in the Cowles area
some time after the'incident
was over and he was at the
police station. He returned to
the campus and found no evi- .
dence of aidistuxbance.

Dean Brown suspended at
Cowles senior from school for
four days after an incident oc-
curring after his return, he told
the 5&8.
