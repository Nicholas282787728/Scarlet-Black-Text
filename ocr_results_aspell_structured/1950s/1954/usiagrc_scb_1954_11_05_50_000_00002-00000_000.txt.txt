There are twenty days until Thanksgiving but yoi
might as well stop counting them off and start counting
the cuts you’ll have if you try to go home. Let’s suppose
you are an average student carrying a standard schedule
of fifteen hours and that you decide it would be pretty nice
to spend Thanksgiving with the folks and break the hold
of the midsemester slumpt You decide to go home and
leave the Collegium around Wednesday noon.

Your return Sunday is greeted with a record of 15
cuts, tlle total alloted you for the semester, because you
missed your Friday and Saturday classes. Let’s imagine
it‘s a week later. You’ve stayed up till the wee hours study-
ing for an exam and you sleep through your eight o’clock,
You‘ve overcut and an extra hours credit is added to your
graduation requirements Yet you’ve really only missed six
classes.

Thanksgiving is a national holiday. Yet Grinnell Col-
lege effectively, if not formally, denies us the freedom to
spend it as we wish, by the existence of the triple cut sys-
tem. Why?

Members of the administration have explained the
policy on the grounds that it costs a lot of money to shut
.a college down. It doesn’t have to be shut down. It doesn’t
cost anymore to keep it running for 85 people than for 850.
If anyone‘s losing money on it, is the students, and that
is their privilege. It is also said that some of the students
can‘t go home because of the time and distance involved.
They sure can’t go home under the present system. Any-
way we weren’t aware that college policy was based on the
status of the minority

The Student Council proposed last night giving double
cllts the day before and after a holiday, and plans to take
up the proposal with Acting President Hawk, This is a
step in the right dir tion. At least under this system a
student would have a little leeway, and would not be forced
to save his cuts for a full semester in order to go home
for Thanksgiving without the penalty of an added hour to
his graduation requirements.

We urge Mr. Hawk and the administrative and faculty
officials concerned to give the Student Council proposal
their full attention.

The Thanksgiving dinner at Grinnell is one social ex-
perience we would just as soon miss.

Since the publication of last week’s S&B, facts have
come to our attention which make it clear that the penal—
ties given for violation of the drinking rule by three stu-
dents last week Were completely consistent with that rule
The cases necessitated different handling due to the fact
that one of them was a case of disorderly conduct on
campus and was a second offense, while the other two were
cases of disorderly conduct off campus and first offenses.

There was no double standard exhibited in this case,
nor has there been a double standard to this date. Our
most sincere apologies to the C of HP, the League Board,
and the students for implying otherwise

Retractions sic sometimes
made voluntarily, even in the
soda. it has occurred to lne that
certain statements made last
week in this column concerns
ing South campus rules were
somewhat uncalled for, Whilc
they may have been founded
on fact, the facts themselves
were distorted by the writer.

Obviously, this error is a
common one, often fallen into
around here, Whether or not
the rumors which were mag-
nified into facts bothered
others, they bother me now.
so—apolugies.

The c of HP and the League
Board have been carrying
through their policies this year
more consistently than this
school has seen before, i bee
lieve this is a safe statement to
make in print. The Administreh
tion is beginning to realize this,
and i believe others are.

I believe criticism is essen-
tially healthy, if it is founded
on fact and reasonably thought
out. I do not believe criticism
is healthy it it carelessly jeop-
ardi'zes the eiiectiveness cl an
efficiently operating body.
Perhaps a sign of improve

ment in the editorial policies of
this paper is shown by the very
fact that this column is being
printed without cutting or edit-
ing, it is certainly blasting all
journalistic standards when an
avowedly editorial-type column
criticizes the practices of its
publisher. But in this case it
seems necessary,

It appears to me that a per-
son ns valuable as' one who
dropped school this week be-
cause of financial matters
should not be‘ let. go so easily
by the school.

When I say valuable, i mean
this: the man is not an athlete
or what is known as a Big Man
on Campus 7 at least not ob
trusively so 7 but he possesses
capabilities in some fields which‘,
are seldom seen here; and hel
is potentially (you’ll pardon the
expression) a leader.

A person like that should i
be helped as much as possible
by a collegc this size. it the l
troubles are financial, they ',
could be remedied, conceiv-
ably, without one having to -i
sign his life away. ‘
The semc thing has happened

before to people of talent but

help, or have been required to

which severely affect their fu—
turcs after graduation, .

Miss Eleanor Sanberg
Acting Secretary
Student Council
Dear Miss Sanberg:

You have written me cancer.»
ing attendance at the October a,
1554 Convocation. This Convo-
cation was planned last summer
We had long discussions about
it in the Executive Council. We
deliberately called it an “All
College Convocation" (a new
name, you will note on the pm
gram) and decided not to take
attendance. Someone, without
our knowlcdge or consent, must
have announced it as a “Re-
quircd Convocation." That was
not our intention.

The ”All College Convocation”
is, frankly, an experiment, We
do not plan to take attendance
if the plan works. It is our inv
tention to have speakers of such
merit that all students will
think that they should attend.
Or, to put it another way, in will
be an experience that “they
can't afford to miss.” That is
our plan and We will View with
interest how it Works out, If.
is an attempt to treat adults
like adults I hope it succeeds

This past Convocation was not
an attempt to confuse the stu-
dents as one might imply from
a hasty reading of your letter.
Our next such Convocation will
be December I. If the students
like this approach, they can
show it by attending.

Yours sincerely,
R, A, Hawk
