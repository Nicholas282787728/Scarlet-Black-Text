H Student Council Discusses Plans

By Adminislraﬁon For Rock Creek Land Purchase

The Student Council is making plans to purchase a
plot of wooded land on a finger of Rock Creek lake west
of Grinnell for the use of college students, Student Council
President Kitten Arveson said Wednesday.

The project,‘ dubbed Lake Acre, includes plans to con
struct a single—room cabin as soon as possible, with the

Students will be able to allo~
cate a portion of the semester
fee under a plan proposed by
Dean of Men Henry A. Brown
and Controller Norris Neveln.
and presented to the Student
Council last night. For the first
time in more than fifty years
the council will receive part of
the fee for distribution.

In past years the Sam fee dis-
tribution has been a process of
several months, and this has
resulted in a delay in planning
by the organizations depending
upon it. It has passed through
the hands of three g‘mups, the
Student Council Central com-
mittee, the Student Organiza~
tions committee, and the faculty.

15% Offered

By giving Student Council the
power to distribute the fcc,
members at the administration
and the Student Council hope that
the process can be speeded up.

The administration’s proposal
provides that 15% of the se—
mester fee be handed over to
the council at the beginning of
each semester. This money will
go to four groups, the 5&3,
KGRW, Student Council, and
the Student Auditor. Formerly
these groups received only 137
14% of the sem fee.

The council agreed :0 accept
the proposal with the stipulation
that they be given access to
the 5% reserve fund in the
event that the 15% is overspent.

The remaining 85% of the
semester l‘ee, which goes to de
partmental activities, will con-
tinue to be distributed in the
former manner.

Co-cd Dining

At its weekly meeting last
night, the council also appointed
a committee to work out de-
tailed plans for cored dining.
The general plan calls for vole
untary participation and sched-
ules the meals for Wednesday
evenings.

The members of the council
elected Ann Patterson as sec-
retary to replace Eli Sanberg.
who will be unable to hold the
office.

They moved, with references
to last Sunday’s convocation, to
request that in the future the
administration make a definite
announcement of whether at»
tendance will be checked at re»
quired convocations.

Welch Reviews
Campus Changes,

Receives Degree

“0 God, we thank Thee that
within these grey and mod
walls old men still see visions
and young men still dream
dreams."

With these words, a quotation
[mm a favorite Harvard pro-
fessor, Joseph Nye Wclch, class
of ’14, closed his address at the
first allrcollege convocation of
the year.

”Jose" Welch, as Grinnellians
have come to know him, titled
his speech “An old Graduate
Reminisccs," Welch stated that
the greatest benefits he received
from Grinncll were an appre-
ciation of the beauty of words,

Joseph Nye Welclt

"invaluable to a lawyer”, an ap—
appreciation of good music, “I was
never so stirred by music as
on the day that Kreisler played
his violin in the chapel”, an un-
derstanding of the principles of
extemporaeneous speaking, “in-
finitely .mportant to a lawyer”,
and the opportunity and en-
couragement to dream, “I dreamt
of standing here during Vesper
services 40 years ago." Welsh
said that the thing he remem~
bered most poignantly about
Grinnell was the vesper service.
Grinnell Greatly Changed

The greatest Change was in
the town, “I recognize almost
nothing after 40 years," he said.
Second to the town changes
were those he found on campus.
However,” he stated, “part of
the charm, part of the security,
and part of the hope which sure
rounds a college is geared to
change. Every shocking change
i happily embrace.”

in an interview with an

5&3 staff member, Wcich
said that the [most important
change ‘was one that was found
on college campuses all over
the country, “Your problems
are more frightening than ours
were," he declarcd. "To tell
you how to run the world on
the basis of our experience
would he presumptous.”

The famous figure of the
Army-McCarthy hearings re-
membered much from his days
at Grinnell, “We had no halls
Such as the present ones when
I was here," he said. ”We lived
in private houses. I guess you'd
say our social life was limited.
We had no movies or dances,

idea of adding wings and bed»
rooms later.

Kitten said the property,
which is surrounded on tl‘fee
sides by state owned land,
would be available to any stu-
dent organization or group upon
completion of the cabin.

"In the winter the lake will
be good for skating,” she add-
ed, "and there is a big hill
nearby that can be used for
skiing or tobogganing. As for
spring and summer, the lake-
front can be refined for water-
activities. picnics, or anything
of that sort.” "

Drive Starts

Money to buy the $1000 plot‘
is m be raised in a student
drive starting Saturday and
running through the following
Sunday. The week-long cam-
paign will be launched at the
GrinnellrLawrence game on Par-
ents’ Day. , .

“If We could get $2 from
each student we could begin
building the cnhin right
away," Kitten Said. “The
transportation problem can be
solved in one oi two ways."
The council will either use a
bus, offered by a town church,
or buy a bus for about 5400,
depending upon the amount of
money raised.

Faculty advisors for the pro»
ject are Madge Phillips (wo-
men's physical education) and
Irwin Simone (men's physical
education).

Acre For Students

“ll: hasn’t been decided yet
whether the deed to the pro.
perty will be in the name of
the Student Council or the
physical education department,"
said Kitten, "But,” she added,
"In either case Lake Acre will
be for the students to use.”

\
except for dances just before
and after the school year, and
[m not too sure that those were
legal,” he added wih a twinkle
in his eye.

”Our sem fee was only $6.
at that time as I recall, but it
was a large and potent sum
then.”

“"On Athletic Letter

Welch remembered withprldc-
receiving the scholarship that»
sent him to Harvard law school
upon graduation from Grinnell.
He majored in political econ-
omy while at Grinnell, and won
“a rather small" letter in tennis,
and was "a top-notch” cribbage
player according to his class—
mates who returned to see him.

During the course of his ad-
dress, Welch dwelt momentarily
upon the ArmvacCarthy hear—
ings. “The truth about me is
that rm not actually real,” he
said. “Thc people made me into
what they needed.

“When I sat stunned and
speechless, you who were
watching me said, ‘What pa-
tience!’

“When I was in an agony
Hf indecision, you would say.
‘how wisc he is!’

“When ‘I was so weary that
my mind was almost a blank,
you would say, ‘What a witty
man!"

“The country, tired of
threats and imprccations want»
ed something different, so
they created an illusion and
gave it my name."
