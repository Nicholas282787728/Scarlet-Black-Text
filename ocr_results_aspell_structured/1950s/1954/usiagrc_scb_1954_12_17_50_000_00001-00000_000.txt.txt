The acre of land on Rock Creek Lake which Project

nell college, and the Women‘s Honor G cabin has been
moved to the new site, Kitten Arveson, Student Council
President disclosed Wednesday.

The land was bought on a
contract providing lor payment
of 5100 immediately and 3390
within one year. The S700 pay-
ment came out of the 3850
total collected in the project‘s
drive over the past months.
The remaining 8150 was spent
to move the cabin,

Recreational activities on the
land will start tollowing Vaca~
tion. Skating is excellent be-
cause of a natural lagoon forinr
ed near the site. Good sized
hills nearby provide superior to-
bogganing conditions. Skiing too
is possible. rrv Simone (Physical
Education) urges students to
bring back skates and skis when
they return from Christmas va—
cation. He also expressed the
hope that several students who
own toooggans would find it
possible to bring them to Grim
neli since Proiect Lake Acre
will not have the funds to pure
chase any this year. He stated
that excellent care would be
given them. .

Events on the land will not
center around the cabin tor a
while, Kitten revealed, because
the building needs a chimney.
Until it is ready, which will
probably be spring, a warming

use of students.
