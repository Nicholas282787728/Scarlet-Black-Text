To the editor:

it is beyond my comprehen—
sion how any group can attempt
to be 50 power hungry as those
students who have attempted
to lead the entire campus in
riotous rebellion against those
as omniscient as the individuals
whose power has so scandal-
1ously been disputed,

Why, it is evident that the
temptation of success-iodder and
the lash of humility should he
used on such brutcs.

Fie upon those who go about
screaming that the future of
the country depends ‘upon the
decision making power oi such
infants. How could anyone be
so lewd as to assert that people
who have not even begun to
decay could he termed as ma.
ture’.’ We are only old enough
to devise ways of earning a
living, raising a family, building
a home, tight for its protection,
and vote for its preservation.

The Tennis Twins (Spaldeg-rrwdz) are unmatched
in their record in top tournament play. And here is
the clinching proof: The Wright & Dilsort is the only
oﬁcial tennis ball used in all U.S.L.T.A. National
Championships (since 1887). Oﬂlcigl, too, in all 0.5.
Dnvis Cup Mat/cheer Oﬁcisl adoptions of its twin,
the Spalding, in other leading tournaments assure
their championship stature in American tennis. Play
