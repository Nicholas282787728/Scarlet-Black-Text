and with great appreciation for
the services they have rendered,
have been notified that they
will not receive contracts forl
next year. l

if the house managements of
the several houses demonstrate
the high degree of responsibil-l
ity and house discipline oil
which i believe students are‘
capable, the program tried out,
experimentally this coming year‘
will be continued.

If on the other hand it be.
comes clear that social and in.
stitutional problems continual».
1y arise which are not subject
to easy etrective solution with.
out the presence of a house
mother in each house, we shall
reinstate the system on the ba—
sis or which we have lived for
many years. ,

Two Representatives
It is now contemplated that
two institutional representatives
will be employed, one of whom
will live in Younker, the other
in Cowles Hall. They will not
be attached to any house and
will not serve as housemothers
in the conventional sense or the
term. They will perform a dual
function of assisting the public
relations department in the
handling of visitors, parents
and prospective studcne. They
will serve as special counselors
to freshman men on social and
health problems. They will give
general supervision to the
housekeeping and operating
functions which occur on the
north campus. They will have
certain other responsibilities and
duties connected with other
offices of the administration.

Chaperones for Parties
It is expected that these wo-
men will ‘be available as Chap»
erones for Friday night open
houses from time to time on
some predetermined schedule
that is worked out between thel
Dean of Men and the house

orticers or the several houses
This experiment is in line
with the sincere desire of the
administration consistently to
enlarge the areas in which stu-
dents assume remonsibility tor
their own lives as students on
the Grinnell College campus."
