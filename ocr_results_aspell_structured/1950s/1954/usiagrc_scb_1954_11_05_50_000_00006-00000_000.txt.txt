Hampton Hopefuls
Should Apply Soon

Applicants for the second se-
mester eiochange program with
Hampton Institute, a four year
Negro college in Virginia,
should apply immediately to
Dean of the Chapel Winston L.
King.

Sophomores are preferred for
the program, but junior appli—
cants will be accepted. Both
have been at Grinnell long
enough," said King, ”to absorb
some of its spirit.” The num<
bar at students sent to Hemp-
ton varies one to three; Grin-
nell receives the same number
of students in return. Both men
and women may apply.

, "Each .student in this pro-
gram", King explained. “has the
experience of being in a mi-
nority group on another campus
in a different part of the coun-
try. We hope that this broaden—
ing of horizons will lead to bet-
ter inter—racial understanding
and; will beneficially affect each
institution."

interested students should
apply through Dean King not
later than December 1. The ap-
plicatians should state the up
piicent's interest in the matter,
why he wishes to go, and what
he expects to gain from the exe ,
perience. The application should
be accompanied by a note of
parental consent.

Faculty Aid Helps '
Lalle Acre Project

The faculty of Grinnell col~
.lege will present “Don Juan in
Hell" in an eﬁfon‘tt to raise the
remaining money needed for the
Lake Acre fund drive.

Thruugh donations the drive
has netted $688 of the neces»
sary $1000 to purchase (the
land. Irv Simone (physical ed»
ucation) said he has high hopes
that the faculty play will fill
in the needed cash.

01 the donations thus tar,
the greatest single contribu—
tion came irom the faculty
childrens’ club, which donated
a total of sin to the project.

Simone also said that the
cabin, which was donated by
the women's Honor G, will be
ready for use following Christ-
mas vacation.

This cabin, which itself is
ready, will be moved as soon
as the site is purchased.

The deed to the land will
be held by the college for two
reasons. First, it will make
the land tax-tree and, second,
it will aid the college’s de-
sin: to extend the campus.

As for long—range plans of
enlarging the cabin and im-
proving the facilities. Simone
seid, “It is entirely in the hands

or the students. If they want it, -

they will have to raise the
money."
