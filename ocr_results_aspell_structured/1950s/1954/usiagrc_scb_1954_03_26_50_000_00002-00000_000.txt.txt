‘Blind Animosity’

One month ago this week the United States observed
Brotherhood Week. Through special articles and programs
the press and radio spotlighted the problem of prejudice.
Public figures in business and government praised the na-
tion‘s advancement toward respect for persons and their
rights without regard to creed, color or national origin.
They also voiced the hope that one day in the near future
there would be no more “blind animosity,” as Bernard
Bamch put it. ‘

The Scarlet and Black observed Brotherhood Week
silently. We thought discrimination and prejudice to be of
no consequence at Grinnell, a school founded and built on
liberal principles—among them that there can be no second-
class citizens. We also thought it inappropriate to pat
ourselves on the back for acting quietly in the proper man
ner.

Our faith in Grinnell and its tradition is well founded,
but it received a sharp jolt last week,

In the election of a house president in a nolth campus
hall a Negro student was one of the candidates. We heard
no comments by students indicating that this was either
an unusual or undesirable situation, bllt that hall’s house—
mother evidently felt it to be both.

Thinking that, of course, is her privilege. But it is not

her privilege, and certainly not her duty, to announce to‘

some of the men that the hall that she would not return
next year if the Negro were elected. As both an administra-

tive staff member, and on the grounds chosen. intervention
in the election was not her right,

Whether her statements had any effect on the elec-
tion is a matter of pure conjecture. Whether the men of
that hall elected the best qualified candidate is not our con—
cern. We are not ableiand do not wisheto compare the
merits of individuals.

President Stevens, when he learned of the incident,
promptly investigated the matter and announced the ad—
ministration’s position when he said yesterday “She will
not be permitted to return next year."

That is a commendable decision, reaffirming Grinnell’s
past and present attitude. If that reaffirmatioon was need-
ed, the incident has had one healthy result. But another
consequence, unfortunately, will probably also follow. The
next two months will be most uncomfortable ones for both
the housemother and the college.

It‘s become fashionable to
berate Senator McCarthy. It’s
fairly clear that much criticism
is rvelleiounded and necessary.
But some other criticism is not.
At least misguided Joe has a
lot oi willing pilots. And some
of them may be able to ride
herd on him before it’s too late,

But it’s too bad that you
never miss the tornado insur—
. ance until your house is being
blown down.

No scandal tornadoes have hit
the Iowa Mental Health Insti-
tute at Mt, Pleasant yet, But
one might sometimeibei‘ore it
becomes iashionable to talk
about it.

= There are about 1400 patientsi
land one psychiatrist who is an
administrator, and two recently

‘ staff.

There are attendants who
are paid an average oi 115
handsome dollars per month
plus room and board or the

l 836 per month. Ancient, filthy
buildings complicate the situae
tion.

There is one iine new build-
ing. They do their best with
what they have. But the state
legislature is their main source
oi income, and the taxpayers of
Iowa owe it to themselves to
abandon the snake pit and to
think and act like intelligent
people. It‘s nvise to avoid
tornadoes.
