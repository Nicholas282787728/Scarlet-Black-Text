Bow In Season's

Tuesday night the Grinnell
freshmen opened their 1956-57
season by losing their debut by
a 80—71 score at the hands of
the Cornell freshman team.
Both teams looked rather rage
ged at the beginning as they be
gan their college basketball ca-
reers, but soon settled down and
played. steady ball

Both teams scored well in
the first half, with Grinnell
getting one more field goal.
However, free throws made
the difference and Cornell
held a 46-40 lead at the half.
The first part of the second
half was quite a different story,

C-oe Takes Conference Firs’r

In the wildest week end of
Midwest Conference play yet
this season, with two overtime
games. one which went into six
.extra stranzas, Coe remained
undefeated and gained sole
possession of first place by vir—
tue of wins over Knox and
Monmouth, The previously un-
defeated Scots lost to Grinnell
as well as Coe and dropped from
a first—place tie with the K07
hawks to a second—place tie with
the Pioneers, whose wins .over
the Illinois teams vaulted them
from seventh no second place.

Their double defeat in Iowa
dumped Knox's Siwashers from
third place to a seventh-place
tie with the Ripon Redmen, who
scored an unexpected Win over
Cornell. By heating winless, cel<
laradwelling Lawrence, Cornell
kept its .500 record and Stayed
in a fourth-place tie with the
idle Minnesota quintets,

The weekend's thriller was
played in Cedar Rapids, where
Coe' finally edged Monmouth
65-62 in the sixth overtime
period. The Scots led 28.24 at
the half; but the Kohawks
closed the gap. and the score
was knotted at 52 all as the
regulation game ended. In l
each of the first extra periods,
the two teams tallied only two
points apiece, Finally, after a
scoreless threeeandea-half min-i
utes in the sixth overtime.
Kohawk guard Don Huff sank
a followup and later tossed in
a free throw to give his team
the 65-62 victory. The Scots
were held scoreless for the
entire five minutes Al Pursell,
who went all the way, led
the Kohawks with twenty-three

‘ points, Glenn Fulton, Jerry
McBride, and Bob McKee
played the entire game for the
Scots, Fulton tossing in fifteen
points.

The other overtimesgame of
the'weeknd was played at Ri-
pon. where the Redmen upset
Cornell’s favored hams, 75—55.
Ripon led by seven points at
the half, but the Rams gradu-
ally narrowed the Redmen lead
and pulled even at 55 all. The
regulation game ended in a 59-
59 deadlock. in a tie between

the timer’s horn and 21 referee's

whistle, and in a violent dis—
pute between the timekeeper
and Cornell coach Gil Wilson.
Wilson hotly maintained that
the whistle, occasioned by a

foul on the part of Ripon’s
Gordie Rush, had sounded first

Eleven varsity members
and coach lrv Simone —Grili-
Ilell‘s champion swimming
combination 7 departed early
this morning for Northfield,
Minn. and two duel meets in
as many days. The pair of
contests will launch the reg
ular conference season.

At 4:00 this afternoon the Pin»
ricer tanksters invaded St. Olaf:
20~yard pool where Simone’s
strategy had the boys taking it
as easy as possible in hopes of
saving something for the second
round of the doubleheader. Tor
morrow it will be Carleton’s
Knights who play host to Si-
lnone’s array of talent which
this year includes one senior,
four juniors, and six sophs.

The Grinnell boys left here
with intent to avenge a 49—“

and that his team was entitled—a setback handed them in their

to a possibly-gameswinning free
throw; the timer just as hotly
held that time had run out7
Wilson lost. The overtime was
all Ripon. Cornell's star, Merle
Gaber, went out on fouls, and
out with him went Cornell's
chances. The Redmen, whose
miserable average on free throws
prevented their winning in
regulation time, suddenly Tea
covered their shooting eyes and
tossed in ten straight foul shots.
The Rams tallied only six ovcra
time points to Ripon’s sixteen.
Hero of the Ripon win was vet-
eran Ed Lindroth, who entered
the game in the second half to
toss in 17 points, six of them
in the overtime. High scorers
were Gaber (26 points) and
hush (20 points).

In the Friday Wisconsin game
the Lawrence Vikings staged
another of their gallant but una
availing uphill battles. Trailing
by 17 points, Lawrence pulled
up to 65-67 with four minutes
to go, but ultimately lost by
four points, 73769. Gaber and
Dick Kine each tallied 25.

ton. The Knights have long
been merciless to Pioneer
swim teams, having won 11 of
the last 13 duel meets between
the two.

However based on the reali-
zation that the Grinnellians are
the defending Midwest champs.
plus the fact that the squad has
been bolstered by acquisition of
six top ﬂight sophomores, the

Pioneers are expected to be
slight favorites.

“We'll be real tough barring
any more ailments or illness-

es," commented Simone. “Our
sophs are looking good, and

.should more than make up for
the loss of Joel Stubbs. The
medley relay team has great
promise and we’re strong in
the breastroke and freestyle."
Jim Jacobson has developed

into the team’s work horse. The
husky six-footer from Des
Moines is capable of swimming
any stroke and will probably
see action in three different
events. His breast and back—
stroke times have established
him as a definite threat in either
type of race,
