One Act Plays Approah Perhection

by Bill Ingram

The Grinnell stoge, traditionally the setting lor good theatre
rather than good dramn, proves capable of housing both this
week. with a program of seldom-seen one-act plays, Kim Chase,

director, has brought the theatre to life (01: the lirst time this ‘

season.

The smoothness and polish with which these iour plays are
presented is little short of amazing. Only once before in this sale
lege generation has such perfection been approached, and it was
not as effective. Of the nineteen actors which Chase employs, only
one has had previous arena theatre experience. Eleven have never
been on the Grinnell stage before, Seven are freshmen And the
plays selected are as difficult ‘.
as any in the modern theatre.
Their success is testimony to
the work of a fine director, and
his very capable assistant cli—
rector Jan Marvin, whose role
was considerably more than
that oi script-holder.

The rest is pantomime, and ex—

lights are well controlled, and
contribute in no small way to
the mood quality or the eve-

Ask yourseli this question: Why do I smoke?

You know, yourself, you smoke for enjoy-

the taste of a cigarette.
