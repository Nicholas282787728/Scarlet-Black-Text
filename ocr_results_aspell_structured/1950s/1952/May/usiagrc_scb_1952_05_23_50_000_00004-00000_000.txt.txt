ed in 212 each, and 'Gates

Cowles hall dropped two
softball games this week to put
them out of the championship
race-South Younker leads the
league, having finished their
schedule with a 6-2 record,
.Gates is in second spot with one
game left with Dibble. If Gates
can win this‘eontest the race
will end in a tie for 'top spot.

The Rammers are protesting
their game with Clark on Wed-
nesday. The final tally was
Clark 9, Gates 8. Early in the
contest a ball was hit into left
field for H Clark home run.
Gates argued that the blow was
a ground rule double. Since a
victory would have virtually
meant the championship for the
Rammers. the case is to be con-
sidered by the intramural board
and the game may be replayed
_next week.
