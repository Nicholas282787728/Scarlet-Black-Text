Trib Labels ROTC

Texl Pro-Russian

Charges by the Chicago Tri-
bune that the air ROTC is giv-
ing cadets in 133 colleges a
favorable impression of Russia
have been vigorously denied by
Air Force brass.

The Tribune claims that
ROTC’s textbook, “world Polit-
ical Geography," is biased in
favor of the Soviet Union.

At Northwestern university,
the coordinator of military units
_lel'med the charges “ridiculous,”
and accused the Tribune of
quoting from the book out of
context.

Members of the c of HP also

tivities at their meeting last
night. They conducted an inves—
tigation of a bottle»throwing dis.
turbance which occurred last
weekend.

Spring day came, and Spring

At 9, after the formal an—

“Sing Man, Sing," the (33er
bouts musical presented Satur-
day in the high school auditor»
ium, was a yretty good Show.
There were good songs, good
laughs, and good performances,
and they 'all combined to make
an enjoyable musical.

Marti DeLong was probably
the most pleasant surprise of
the whole production _ that is,

after the set. Her presence on
stage was always the pivotal
point around which the whimsy
and gaiety revolved.

About that sot; rvo felt for
a long time that Coorgo
Goughnour was the unsung
theatrical genius of Grinnell
(if we have one) and I cite
the “Sing Man, Sing" set as
exhibits x, y, and z. The
trouble with George is that
he‘s not’eccentric enough to
be appreciated.

Rog Perry did a fine job with
‘the paradoxical part of String
fellow Bean. I especially liked
the way he got through the
soliloquy.

grown used to seeing them do

Rolland Hurst hasn‘t changed a

Probably the two most an.
noying things about “Sing Man,
Sing" were the heat of the audi.
torium and the nauseating stage
antics after the show, both of
which seem to be becoming
somewhat inevitable parts of
Grinncll activities.

Jinn Leavenworth proved
himelf the capable director

Of course no musical is worth
much without songs and with
those, "Sing Man, Sing" was
loaded. All the songs were good
and it would be unfair to single
out any one for heroism in this
field.

As a whole. “Sing Man, Sing”
