How ’bout a Pint?

Grinnell college has often been condemned for its ivory
tower tendencies. It seems that such condemnation might

very well be in order.

At the Student Council meeting last night, it was re-
vealed that only 120 students had indicated a desire to give
blood for the armed forces. With a student body of 826, the
number of volunteers is shocking.

The Department of Defense has repeatedly sent out
pleas for blood and thousands of people have responded.
But United States battle casualties in Korea have reached
107,666 and blood is needed desperately.

On Thursday, May 22, a Red Cross bloodmobile will,

be on campus. Grinnell students and faculty are asked to
give their blood. We think they have an obligation,
Many schools which have participated in the program
have put on large, well—managed campaigns to get pledges.
They’ve had rallies and bonfires and dances. And they’ve

reached their quota. They’ve

been pictured in magazines

and written about by the news services. Grinnell hasn’t had
rallies and bonfires and dances. But the college should be
able to reach its quota. If one is in a healthy condition,
there should be no question as,to his obligation,

Four hundred pledges are

needed by Thursday, May 1.

Will Horn gave his life in Korea, Can’t you give your blood?

‘Lady’s Not for Burning’
Proves Delightful Comedy

by Jo Tam l

The difficulties of a 'discharg-l
ed soldier who wishes to be
hung and a young girl who is
trying to escape death consti-
tute the deligthul comedy, “The
Lady's Not for Burning,” by
Christopher Fry. ,

The play is being presente
tonight at 8 pm. and tomor-
row at 8:30 p.m. in AEH audi-
torium.

The worldly, philosophical
comments of the soldier, Thomasl
Mcndip, played by Herbert Len-l
caster, and the sensible, broad-
minded remarks of the supposed
witch, Jennat Jourdemayne,
played by Jerrie Smith, are out»,
standing contrasts to the super
stiticus inhabitants of the may-i

the mayor’s nephew,

The blustcring, sneezing may-
or, played by Bob Starrett, and
his chattering sister, played by
Priscilla Nancarrow, are a relief
from the general profundity of
the conversation.

The love conflict results be-
tween a naive lady played by
Nancy Nattemcr and Humphrey,
by Bill
lngram, with some competition
from his brother Nicholas, play»
ed by Allen Harrison, and the
mayor‘s humble clerk by George
Goughnour. The play is enacted
in a manner customary to the
lath century in which the action
takes place.

0iit where I live, if there‘s a
good moon in the sky and the
tide is right you can go grun-
nion hunting at night and octo-
pus hunting in Ihe daytime. I’ve
done both and I‘d hate to have
to decide which is more fun.

Grunnion are slippery little
fish that ride the breakers onto
the sand where they dig holes
with their noses and bury their
eggs. Hunting them consists of
running around the beach with
a flashlight; when you see a
grunnion you grab it and you
can keep it to do as you wish
with. They’re Supposed to be
good eating—l don’t know be-
cause I’ve never had any.

One of the hazards of grun-
nion hunting is couples lying
around in the sand which are
easily tripped over, Logs and
driftwood, too. A lot of times
kids say they are going grunnion
hunting and then when they get
to the beach they don’t. They
just get in everyone’s way.
That's why you need a flash-
light. '

Octopus are different. You
hunt them in the daytime. The
important thing is to watch the
paper to see when there‘s going
to be a minus-tide, They print
that kind of stuff out there.

If the minus—tide came on a
Sunday we’d round up a couple
of cars full of octopus hunters
and head for Cabrillo beach,
which is just what the name
says: a beach. The good thing
about Cabrillo is that it’s real
big and it never gets too crowd—
ed. not even on Sundays. In
fact, if you hit it lucky and it’s
sort of overcast, therc'li be no
one around but octopus hunters,

All you need to “catch grun-
nion is your hands, Like I said,
octo us are different. You need
‘a sick to caich them, It’s kind
of funny to talk about calchil’ig
octopuses because they’re so
dumb they really catch them-
selves. ' v

It's really a riot. You stick
the stick down -in between a
couple of rocks and the cams
pus’ll grab hold of it like it was
part of the rules. All you’ve got
to do is pull the stick up and
you’ve got youself an octopus.
Of course, the kind we get out
at Cabrillo are pretty small and
I suppose it would be better to
call them squid. Either way, it's
a lot of fun:

There's always a couple of
old guys who can’t speak much
English running around there
with a stick in each hand. As
far as they're concerned, there's
no better eating than squid. So
whenever I catch a squid,- I alv
ways give it to one of those old
guys and they really appreciate
it Sometime they’ll take a half
an hour to thank you if you let
them. Of course, maybe they
aren't saying “thanks" and if
they Weren’t I'll never be the
wiser because all i understand
is English.

When you’re hunting octopus
you find all kinds of strange
sca animals swimming around
between the rocks. Our geology
prof told us that some of them
have been swimming around
those same rocks for millions
and millions of years. I don’t
doubt that a bit,

Geology is Sure an interest-
ing subject and maybe some
week I’ll write a whole article
about the field trips we used to
take when l was ,taklng a
course in it. Sometimes. if the
prof was a good joe, he’d let
us take a case of mellow, mild
Eastside beer along with us and,
boy, we really used to have
some good times. I flunkcd the
course, but I’ll never regret a
minute of those field trips.

Grinnell's pretty good, though.
