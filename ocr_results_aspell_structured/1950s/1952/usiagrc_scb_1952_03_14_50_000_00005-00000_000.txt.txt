Terry Ellis
by Kim Stringer

No doubt you have seen him
walking around campus, sipping
coffee at the union, or working
out on Ward field tossing the.
16 pound shot or carrying the
pigskin,

There are few students, fee»
,ulty members. or ladies dishing
‘out the chow at Cowles who
idon't know Terry Ellis. This
affable, personable gentleman is
what a coach would call “real
football material." He not only
excels on the gridiron, but has
,a reputation in track for putting
the shot farther than any man
in the Midwest conference.

Last Saturday at the Univer-
sity of Chicago, Terry threw

 

52‘the shot to a new indoor cons
51lference record of 45 feet 8%
51iinches to better his own mark

_ lHeipenstell,Rawsim
Two records were broken inlc. Frank, Gates

“Not merely good but

delicious”

Roger Zimmerman, Clay» l

lset a year ago.
‘ Al Grinncil, Terry has let-
tered in both football and
track.
Terry hails from Chicago
here he was a 10-ietter man
Hyde Park high school,
li-ie played tackle in football,
lright fieldin baseball, guard in
ibasketball, and specialized in
‘the shot put iii track. Among
,his teammates were A] Gold.
Ifarb, Fred Rubel, and Ron
Frank.

Like most sportsmen, Teri-y
igof interested in athletics by
playing sandlot ball in Park
District leagues. in his junior
,year in high school he finished
second to Goldfarb in the shot
put, and a year later established
a new city league record of
i52 feet, 1% incheswith the 12
pound shot.

He was captain of the track
squad, vice-president of the
senior class, pruiricnt of the
student council, and was vot-
ed the outstanding graduate
in his class.

Last year in the conference
‘meet at Beloii, Terry set a new
conference outdoor mark of
:47 feet. In addition he holds
.shot put records for the Co:
{relays the lows Outdoor AAU,
the Coe-Cornall-Grinnell tri<
langular, and the indoor and out-
door conference meets.

In his leisure time he is at
home in Rawson lounge reading
the sports page. Terry follows
the White Sox closely and sticks
by the Chicago Cardinals and
jthe University of Illinois.

i When it comes to track; both
coaches and players agree that

“Ole Terr" really tosses
‘mean one.
