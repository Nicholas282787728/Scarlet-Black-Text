Drake, ISTC,
lSC Sa+urday 1

Grinnell opens its 1952 tennis'
season tomorrow with a prac-
tice tourney at Iowa State
college in Ames.

The meet will be quadrangu-
lar with Drake, Iowa State
Teachers college, Grinnell, and;
the host school competing. Each“
ehool will send five men to
play in five singles
,doubles brackets.

’ The live Grinnell players
to make the trip will be Bob
Dibble, Bill ‘Hamilton, Bob ‘
Skrainka, Harry Young, and
Jim Maffitt.

Individual brackets will play
separately and team scores will
be determined by the total
games won. Each set will be
limited to a maximum of ten
games.

The first regular meet of the
Pioneer campaign is scheduled
for Saturday, April 19, against
Knox on the courts behind Ward.
field. Coach John pfitsch preu
dicts another good season for
the squad which placed second
in the conference last year.

Dibble, .who took the singles
title in 1951 is returning, but.
Joc Popple who finished second,
and Phil Bennet, another singles
stalwart, have graduated,

“We are fairly strong now—
about like the beginning of last
season—and should be in good
shape by the time conference
rolls around," Pfitsch asserted
confidently.

Pfitsch emphasized that the
Knox meet will be an interest—
=ng match to watch. The Siwash
are considered maior contenders
for the midwest title along with
Carleton and Grinnell. Last
season the Pioneers won the
meet eel.

An innovation of bleachers
so spectators can watch home
matches more comfortably is
planned.

Pfitsch optimistically remark-
ed. “1 hope by the addition of
the bleachers to get more fans
out to see the boys play. We’ve
got a good team and the stu~
dents will‘ enjoy watching them.
It is far better to play before
crowdskeveryone puts forth
more effort."

Swarms of men have dusted!

Cowles, leading the intramural i
race again this year, . favored
to retain the baseball crown
they captured last season.

Stan McClintock is reputed the
league's outstanding hurler and
brother John can come in cap—
ably in relief- if necessary. This
combination, plus an airtight

According to John Bridgham,
professor emeritus of languages,
who is manager of the faculty
