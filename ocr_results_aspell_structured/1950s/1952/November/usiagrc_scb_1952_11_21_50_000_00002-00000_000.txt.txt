No Room in thé Inn

There are over 20 barracks apartments on the Grin-
nell campus, put here by the government when the vet-
erans Were ﬂooding the school and bringing their families
along. The barracks are now college property.

Less than lalf of the apartments are now occupied
by students. Other families, some working for the college,
live in the rest, on a nine month lease from the college.

And that’s as it should be. If there are not enough
students to fill the barracks, then the college would be
losing Valuable revenue if it didn’t rent the rest, But there
are students on campus who intend to get married soon,
and would like to move into the barracks at the beginning
of the second semester. The couples have been told that5
they may not be able to, because there isn’t any room.

The barracks are her for the specific purpose of
providing a place for married students But the college
now finds an intricate problem. It can’t evict the non-
students now living in the barracks without breaking a
lease extending until June. But it should make room avail—
able to the couples Wanting it. .

There isn’t a quick solution to this year’s problem!
but the college can learn a lesson. A semester lease would
let students have first choice on the barracks at semesters,
as well as at the first of the year. ‘

A Case in Point

- College pranks are supposed to be humorous; many of
them are. The theft of the C of HP paddles was probably
intended to be funny, but it has gone on a bit too long.
The men’s hall presidents have made many efforts to
recover the paddles without causing too much trouble for’
the thieves, and can hardly be criticized for their actions.

As a result of their attempt to save the freshman
men five cents on every paddle, the council now finds
itself with a bill for $200 and no paddles. The case can
‘still be closed with no one suffering too much, but events
must move rapidly. If the police enter the case, prosecu-
tion for grand larceny faces the persons responsible. The
joke has ended.

Letters to

withhold lion oubilouclou own mile-L
Dear Everybody:

This missivc is directed at
those students who don’t go to
housemeetings, to those who
don’t read their hall bulletin
boards, and to those professors,
associate professors, instructors,
janitors, and kitchen help who
might be interested, Last year
we talked of making records

Sing." Several of you spoke to
me about it when I was back
Homecoming and i am now hap-

been made toward the ultimate
goal. The only thing that, stands
in the way is, as usual, money.

Here are the details. We can
have two hundred copies at a
cost of two dollars a copy. The
price per copy goes up as the
number goes down so it would
be better if a large number of
you ordered a copy (or copies).
They will be black, double-faced
(two sides), twelve-inch, 33 1/3
rpm records and are well Worth
the price, whatever it may be.
Only one or two songs were de-
leted because of impossible
length or because they weren’t
up to par. But the records will
be good.

Now here’s what I’d ﬁlm you
to do. Send me, on a twocpenny
postcard, your name and the
number of copies you wish.
From this I’ll figure the cost and
send you the price. Then you
send me the money and I’ll take
care of the rest. Please send
your orders soon because the
sooner you answer, the sooner
you’ll get the record.

Yours truly,

Jim Ploss

To the editor:

in regard to last week’s “Let
in to the Editor” written by
one Mr. Merle Fischlowitz, cons
concerning the ”nauseating non-
sence” of the Chicago Tribune:
Obviously Mr. Fishlowitz does
not care for horses, which 'is
pcifcctly all right because there
are undoubtedly things which he
likes that I do not Care for.
However, i see no need in writ
ing sarcastic letters merely be-
cause the oldest College west of
the Mississippi received a little
recognition due to the fact that
it has a few quadrupeds stabled
on its campus.
Mi. Fischlowitz seems to think
that we are “hypothetically
classed” with such institutions of

>equine attainment as Kentucky

and Harvard. First of all, Ken-
tucky and Harvard are not in-
stitutions of equine attainment,
although this is‘beside the point.
Grinnell is noted for its excel-
lent riding department, and
furthermore. Merle, whether you
believe it or not, some of ins
did come to Grinnell because of
it.

May 1 suggest that you and
some of your doubting
friends take a walk out to the
stable and see what a fine setup
we have. (If you haven't yet
located the new barn, I would
be glad to escort you out.) And
just think, wouldn’t this be a
funny world if we all liked the
same things...

To the editor:

For the benefit of Mel‘le Fisch-
lowitz and .other students who
were disappointed with the edi-
torial. abdut Grinnell and horses
which was reprinted in the 5&5,
let’s look at the reply to that
editorial which was printed in
the Tribune.

BOASTING FROM GRINNELL

“Chicago, May 29—As a loyal
alumnus of Grinnell college, I
arise in righteous indignation to
denounce the foul aspersions
contained in today’s editorial,
“The Educated Horse.” Without
the slighted justification, you
have intimated that the animal
in question may not have freely
and voluntarily selected Grin-
nell—the fairest college of the
landgas his alma mater. Oui-
educational standing is too well
known to merit any doubts on
this score, and the verdant prair-
ies surrounding the college pro
duce corn and oats of a quality
to delight the heart of any horse.
in addition, sir, we-possess a
notcablc distinction not shared
by some of our sister institu-
tion's—our equine alumni are

J.R.H.”

if you have never made a bed
before, you have missed a so-
cial experience. it is like wears
ing an old sport coat and sitting
with other uncomfortable men
in a squalling dining room. It
is like the non-drinking of beer
and going to the union because
Your name is on a scarlet card
and face, thereby, taboo. Shades
of Hester Prynne.

1 made my bed when i was
in the army and don‘t think it
did me any particular harm or
good. Occasionally 1 caused a
lieutenant to swear and that
made me feel very good. One
black Monday‘moming my bed
was made with the sheets out-
side the blankets: The lieutenant
asked me if i were a motor mot-
on, Withasmilelsaid: .ch, sir!"
“Yes. sir!" he shouted. “No sir!"
i replied. “Don’t contradict me,"
he said. You can't very well,
win. Anyway, we made our beds
because we were told. We were
also getting paid. just like the
maids on north campus. Ap-
patently north Campus still has
maid service. After all it’s in
the rule book. Everyone knows
what that means. i remember
a few times when students pe—
titioned the administration for
a change, but like it says in
the book—Let’s live it up.
Mud was hero for awhile this
week. The area behind the wo-
men’s gym was as usual ixn<
psssabls.,'l\vo years ago some
enterprising student . Council
candidate put some planks» there
and made a pun about it when
he discussed his platform. The,
pun was as bad as his support
and now even the planks are
gone. After all, what’s a little
mud? Wallow in it. Be gay.
Speaking of mud, you ought
to sit in on these debates. The
participants must have learned
a lot during the conventions,
especially how to misinterpret
each other for the sake of mis-
interpretation. A few of these
fellows even learned to imitate
the politician's gestures and how
to make the snide remark about
the opposition. _Somcbody the
other day implied I was a com-
munist and before 1 caught
myself, i felt like running right
out into the street and calling
the police. The man was from
Wisconsin and that explains it.
It's a disease. i heard another.
fellow from, Wisconsin discuss
foreign aid. He said: “If those
foreigners are hungry, let them
eat each other." And about in-
tel'nationalism: “This one world
business is no good. We ought
to call the boys home and build,
a wall around this country." At
that l shook my fist. “I know,"
he continued, “I know what
you're going to say.” He touchr
cd his finger to my nose. “Af-
ter we build the wall, my boy,
why then we’ll put a ceiling
over it.”

This proves you should come
to Michigan for your vacation.
It has everything Wisconsin has
and the people are - civilized.
At least the Michigan Repub-
licans are civilized. Especially
those who live in Grand Rapids.

I’d like to close with some
compliments. KGRW has de-
veloped into a fine radio sta-
tion. The staff no longci just
seems busy. i listen to the Ad-
Vanced Communication boys and
girls spout righteousness and
lShaw and am agreeably Sur-
lprised. Tea and Crumpets is a
tasteful jazz show despite oven
tones of: “Hey man You way
