'Herm' Doubles on Offense, Defense
Phlsch Names Hager 'Mos’r Reliable';

by Bob Dickinson

Back in the football seasons
of the past, Grinnell Was a
name to be feared in college
football. The 1926 Scarlet and
Black football team, for in-
stance, beat Drake. Kansas, Mar-
quette, Pennsylvania, and Wash
ington universities.

That season, the heaviest man
playing ball for Grinnell weighe
ed less than two hundred
pounds.

This year the football squad
has about the same size, power,
and perhaps speed according to
one devoted Grinneliian who
has watched the Pioneer grid
team for 48 years. He said he
was confused as to why Grin»
nell didn’t, Win wtth naturals

he began to name some of the
boys on the squad. in his listing
came the familiar call of a fab-

ulous litle guy named Don Ha-
ger.

“Natural" — — - why that
was what coach John Pfitsch
had to say for the guy. He
started to relax and enjoy
himself when talking about
his ”most reliable boy", The
coach looked hurt when he
explained how Don had a bad
season this year because of
his injury in the first game.
Coach Pfitsch asserted, how-
ever, “Don has a tremendous
will to play ball and no one
can keep him down."

Don Hager is the quickato-
smile type of guy. Just 20, five
ft. eight in., he tips the scales
at 175 lbs. He numeraled in
track as a sprinter in his first
year. He now plays two var-
sity sports, basketball and foot»
ball, in both of which he let-
tered in his sophomore year.

Don is the type of guy who
accepts responsibility on and
off the field, as any of his
friends will readily affirm. At
Marshalltown high school Don
won state wide acclaim as a
first string all state football
player, and third string guard
in basketball.

Doubling on offense and (le-
fense, "Herm”, as he is called
by some of his friends, is
strictly a team man. He is at
his best under pressure, There
is little doubt that Don is the
outstanding athlete in the
junior class.

Don himself says he has “but-
terflies" before every game.
When asked about the last game
and the rest of the season he
said, “The team seems to have
found itself. We feel we can
win the rest. Our last game was
a moral victory, the rest of
them will be real victories."

rolled to a 4 -l ead at the
half. it looked as though the
Scarlet and Black were in for the
beating of their life, but then
came the third quarter. Quarter—
back Bob Norton passed to Nick
Ryan in the end zone to climax
a sﬁayard scoring drive.

The Pioneers stopped the
Braves for the first time in
the game on an intercepted
pass and Dunham rambled
around right end again from
the zo to make it 41-33,

The Grinnell gridmen con
tinued to stop the Braves. and
on the fourth play in the fourth
quarter Dunham went over
right tackle for 36 yards and
Dunlop added the extra point to
make it “>40 with ottawa still
in the lead. Five minutes later,
Norton sneaked over from the
one after a pass from Dunham
to Golden, making it 46-41.

But the Pioneers couldn‘t hold
their lead, and with seven
minutes left in the game, ottawa
tallied the fin touchdown to
win 48-46. Gri nell tried to
march again. but lost the ball
on downs on the Ottawa 30. .

chuck Dunham was the big
scoring gun for the Pioneers
as he tallied five times. Bob

Norton, playing his best game
of the season, completed 9 out
of 13 passes. Griuneli outrush-
ed the big ,ottawn team 332

Dunham compiled 195 yards
in 12 rushes tor a 16.25 average.
He has averaged 8.4 yards in
Grinnell’s first five games. Var.
tan averaged 8.5 in eight tries;
Ryan 7.2 in six; and Petroff 3.7
in six.

Grinnell passed for 202 yards,
completing 58 per cent of their
tosses Not once did the passer
get tackled before he could get
rid of the ball. This shows the
excellent protection that the line
gave Clein and Norton.
