Winless Pioneers Battle Carleton

 

Dunllaln; 1951, Homecoming Star,
leads Conference Backs in '52

by George Simon

Chuck Dunham—a name that
Grinnell alumni who attended
Homecoming last year haven't
forgotten.

Chuck Dunham—a fellow that
Grinnell students saw go wild
on ward field two weeks ago.

Chuck Dunhzimithe Grinnell
college varsity football players
know him too. They were the
boys that helped him score the
last quarter touchdown and ex-
tra point that licked Cornell
776 last Homecoming. And they
were the ones who cleared the
way for their flashy left half-
back to score iive touchdowns
against. Ottawa a fortnight ago
in the greatest onceman scoring
splurge seen in these parts for
many a year.

And thats not all. In six
games so far this season Chuck
has carried the pigskin 67
times for a rushing yardage of
525 yards. Not only does this
give him an average of 7.3
yards per carry, but puts llim‘
ahead of all Midwest conference
hacks and last week raised
him to 15th in the nation for
small college backsx

Despite all the raving press
releases ivhich have been
showering this 165 pound senior
from Lansing, Mich. he re
mains surprisingly modest and
quiet, and a team player. In
addition to his excellcnt run-l
ning, Dunham is q fine defen-
sive back and according to
Coach Pfitsch “a better blocks
ing back than a runner." No
wonder then that Chuck was
chosen by'his teammates to be
tri-captain of the squad in to
inorrow's clash with Carleton.

Chuck's carcer hasn't always
been as spectacular as during
this season. He dmn’t letter unr
til h' junior year and then his
playing wasn’t of the sensa—
tional variety. Even this year,
just a week ago, Chuck was

intent on handing the Rams!
their fifteenth consecutive loss.
Instead they met an inspired
ball‘ club, and were handed their
sixth straight defeat this season
by a score of 1576.

their Homecoming festivities asi

the Grinnell yearlings 7 to 0 on
a fourth quarter fumble.

Only a brilliant 80 yard punt
returned by Nick R, n in the
third period saved the Pioneer
\‘alblly from complete humilia-
tion. During the remainder of

4the contest. the G nnell offense
was able to gather a mere es
yards and five downs as a stout

Cornell scored twice in in g}
touchdown drives in the first'
half, and in the last period adds,

loss dropped the Pioneers into
the conference basement

 

stopped cold by a determined
Cornell squad which gave him
Just 10 yards all afternoon, and
held the entire Grinnell backs
iield to some 322 rushing yards.

Dunham called last week's
battle the “poorest lootball ex-
hibition" he had ever seen, but
thinks that the team has come
back this week in scrimmage
with a
the 'Pioneers will win this *un .
But they may have to do it
without Chuck.

Against Cornell, Dunham not
only tore a cartilage in his
ribs, but also sprained an ankle
which could limit his action
tremendously. In yesterday's
workout, he'was barely able
to run at a slow trot, and that
with pain, Piltsch doubts that
Chuck will be in top form by
Saturday, but is sure that his
swift back will ”be in for
awhile."

Pfitscli was,very liberal in
his praise of Dunham. ”I'm
amazed at his development over
last year. Chuck has blossomed
into one of the best running,
blocking, and defensive backs
i've seen in my five years here.”
He has “worked very hard for
the team" and “I
trade him for any other back
in the conference." Grinncll
fans agree.

Lino coach Bob Peterson had

Key lniuries Plague Grinnell

Gl-ilinells blilised, hatteled, and illlvictolious Pioneers

1 ill be out to add a little
lseason tomorrow against
‘ year:

light to an otherwise dismal

nl'letoll in the highlight of this
5‘ Homecoming activities,

i After dropping six straight, including tl 15-6 upset to
Cornell last week, the Scarlet and Black face an up and

down Carleton team in what
.pull out of the Midwest con
ference cellar. Victorious in
only two of six games, the Carls
‘ have not been too impressive
this year but have displayed
,enough class to establish thcrrie
selves as favorites over the hap-
less Pioneers.
Captains elected by the team
for the game are Dunliam and

(—1
senior ends Dave Stumbaugh
turd Rick Ficdorowicz.

Carleton's record shows 194)

lzmd 26713 triumphs over Corr
hell and Knox, both oi which

handed out lickings to Grinnell..

‘Theil losses came at the hands
lof Monmouth, 196 Lawrence,
lzs 13 Rlpun, 190. and st. Olaf,
41 13. The only bright spot in
this is the comparative scores
of the two opponents against
St. Olaf.

While Carleton was thorough
ly whipped by the Oles, Grill-
nell dropped a close 20s14 cone
1 test to the same team.

Carleton's “’1‘" formation
with an imbalanced line is
spearheaded by sophomore
quarterback Dick White and

i all—conference guard Jim Man—

' cuso, who is a possible Little
iy’All-Amel‘icnn candidate this
year, It is worth rioting that

when White is on, so are the
Carls, or vice-versd. So stop-
ping him will he one of Grin-

lRick Fiedoxowicz

could be their only chance to

nell's main objectives.

lniuries again took their toll'
of the Pioneer ranks last week
in perhaps their most drastic
attack of the year. Chief cas~
ulties arc senior backs chuck
iDunham and John McClintock
Dunham pulled a cartilage from
a rib, a painful but not too
serious injury, and McClintock
suffered a badly sprained ankle,
Both should be ready for the
encounter but will not be in top
shape, Perhaps the most line
portant blow to Pioneer hopes
was the permanent loss of tackle
Terry Ellis who reinjured the
bad knee that has limited his
play since the opener against
Coe. Ellis is definitely out and
ithc loss of his fire and spirit
‘as well as his rugged line
iplay will be sorely missed.
j All is not bad on the iniury
‘Column. however, as iunior halik
iback Don Hager is back to top
shape for the first time since
the Coe game and tackle George
Baker will be ready alter miss—
iing the Cornell contest with a
itwlsted knee.
l Coach John Pfitsch pointed
lout that the Pioneers will have
‘to be in a mucti better frame
lot mind than they were in last
lweek's dismal showing or they
'won’t stand a chance. .
