It’s Our Problem Too

The explanation on page one of Grinnell’s financial
condition brings to light a problem of national importance,
for our situation is typical of that of privately endowed
colleges and universities throughout the country. i

‘A recent survey of 700 such institutions shows that
over 80 per cent are operating with deficits Three factors
have caused this situation.

1. There are not as many students of college age as

had been expected. This is due to the draft, the lower

birth rate in the early 1930‘s, and the tendency of
women toward early mar age, or just not to go to
college.

2. Operating expenses have risen 220 per cent since

1939, inﬂation and other factors, but the cost of going

to college has risen an average of 80 per cent.

3. Income from endowments has been shrinking be

cause of lower interest rates.

These are tlle facts,

We don’t know whether or not the Grinnell men
should make their beds Six days a week. We do know that
this situation reflects one aspect of the national dilemma.
We also know that the solutioll of our own local problem
should not be made without seriously considering the
status of higher education in the United States. If our
college, and others like it, are going to exist, tney must
accept one of two alternatives: ‘

The price of a college education may be raised, possibly
reversing the present trend toward more education for
more persons, or

The price of this education may remain the same. If
the price remains constant, colleges must either lower their
standards or find new sources of income. Additional in-
come may come from an increase in gifts from business
and industry, or grants from the federal government.

Why should we be cuddled?
Many students on this campus
feel that the elimination of
maid service would be an un-
endurable hardship. We at Grin-
hell are spoiled. We have learn-
ed to expect too much service
and to accept too little responv
Slbility.

We feel that all students
should be expected to have
complete care of their rooms.
This would include making
beds, picking up linens at a
central agency in each hall,
and Cleaning rooms. Is it too
much to ask of the ”overhurs

l students feel

their traditional, cherished maid
service were cut down, it may
mean a $25 semester increase in,
tuition. Do these same students
realize that it takes a college
employed student about 50
hours to earn $257 These stu-
dents and many others can not
afford to pay this probable tui-
tion increase.

it is time that students who
can afford maid service take
into consideration. that there
are many students who may
have to leave Grinnell for fin-
anClal reasons because of an ac-
cumulation of small issues such,
as this.

We feel that students should
realize that if maid service is

While i was in Denver at the
Sigma Delta Chi convention, i
ran into quite a few former
Grinnellians. One came up her
hind me in the lobby of our
hotel and casually tapped me
on the shoulder. That was Dick
Georgeson. i should say Lt. Dick
Georgeson because that’s what
he is now.

Meeting a former Grinnellian
in a town like Denver is a lot
different from meeting the some
guy in Grinncll. For one thing,
Denver is a pretty wide open
city and it's considered impolite
to talk without a drink in your
hand. Dick had a lot of things
and people to ask me about and
we did a lot of talking. Maybe
it was the atmosphere and may-
be it was the scotch. it might
even have been the high alti-
tude. Whatever it was, I was a
bit amazed to find anyone so
interested in Grinnell. Dick was
not the only one.

He drove me up to Boulder
to see the campus of Colorado
U. and to look up a few people.
We were sitting in a little res-
taurant called the “Tulagi” or
the “Tool” which is neither littlc
nor a restaurant. (They're pretty
strict about drinking at Colo<
radomyou must be able to prove
that you're 18.) x was being
sociable again and i thought i
was having hallucinations when
a guy staggered in wearing an
Honor G jacket. That was Tom
Gage, who’s a law student now.

I had to answer a lot more
questions for Torn. He wanted to
know all about the old collegium
and more particularly, which
couples had gotten married and
all that. Ken Clayton was the
same way and so was Willard
Smith. i couldn’t tell them very
much because they were here
before my time.

i also ran into a guy from
u.s.c. where 1 “studied" for a
couple of years. There was a big
difference in that meeting. We
talked for nearly a half-hour
and we were unable to name a

single person we both know. We

finally called it quits saying
that sc is sure a big school.

I wonder how many of us are
going to be as interested in
Grinnell as the gentlemen I
talked to in Denver were. I felt
kind of guilty telling them about
budget cuts and things like that
because they didn’t seem to think
those matters had any place in
a college such as Grinnell. 1
couldn’t seem to get them to
realize that Grinnell college is

light of Grinnell, 1s Doc Sam
putting his ideals into practice
at his college?

Isn’t it true that if these ideals
stand at Grinnell, students should
have freedom to develop without,
constricting rules, without being
regimented. if they stand, we
should have unlimited cuts, no
hours for women. no car rule,
in fact no rules. Does this sound
radical? These are the principles
as they can be applied in the
extreme.

But no, you say, we must
have rules for the efficient run.
