LUCKIES ,
TASTE BETTER 1

It takes ﬁne tobacco to give you a better-
tasting cigarette. And Lucky Strike
means ﬁne tobacco. But it takes some- '

thing else, too—superior workmanship.
You get ﬁne, light, mild, good-tasting
tobacco in the better-made cigarette.
That's why Luckies taste better, So, Be
Happy—Go Lucky! Get a carton today!
