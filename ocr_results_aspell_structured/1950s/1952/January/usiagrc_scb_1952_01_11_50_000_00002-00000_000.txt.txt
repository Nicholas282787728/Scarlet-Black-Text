iHomecoming--19_52

After this year‘s homecoming, the S&B printed all ed-l
itorial advocating two changes in the present set—up. One,
suggestion was to select a committee which would start-l
making plans the previous spring. The other was to have
a specific allotment of money for the committee.

Now, Dave Baumgartner, social coordinator, has come:
up with a more detailed plan concerning those,‘l'ecomlnendllri
tions. He suggests that an executive committee should be
organized in early May to make plans for the following
year, The committee would be composed of the social
coordinator as chairman, the presidents of the men’s and,
women’s Honor G, and a representative flom the cheelu
leaders, League Board, C of HP, and Student Council.

We heartily agree that a committee should be appointed
in the spring but we would suggest a committee of volun-
teers, headed by the social coordinator. Much work would
have to be done in the fall and it is at that time of organic
zation that the heads of clubs are very busy. Such a com»
mittee might also help alleviate the cry which is so often
heard in all schools, "The same people do everything."

Baumgartner also suggests that money be allotted for
homecoming from such sources as the social reserve fund,
Gadaliouts, or the informal social chairman’s budgets At
present, money must be solicited from student organizations.

Another recommendation is an enlargement of the
homecoming program. With that we‘d also agree. At pres-
ent, a Grinnell homecoming isn’t much to come home to.

Do books have to represent a wrestling match with
the billfold'l

What with the high prices of textbooks in the boo -
store, Grinnell college students should have some way 0
exchange used books. Four years ago the YWCA fresh-
men commission organized such an exchange. Does your
billfold ask for details?

After the commission posted the list of books to be
used the following semester, used texts were gathered from
students and were sold in the Little Theater. Everyone
profited: the student who wanted to rid himself of a
dust-gathering textbook, lhe student who acquired it at h‘
saving, and the commission which pocketed a 10 percentl
handling charge. Check your billfolds. They‘re probably
nodding in silent approval. ‘

The following letter was writ-
ten to Nick Fiediscalzi, co-chair~
man of the wssr drive at Grinr
nell lhis year.

Dear Nick:

I wish 1 could adequately er
press to you our sincere thanks
and appreciation for the $850
check representing lhe initial
installment of lhis year's con-
tribution from Grinnell sfudenls
and facully to wssr...

Your contribution and those of
other schools with fall drives
that responded, has brought the
regional fofcl of funds avail-
able to aboul 25% of last year's
total contributlons,..

It is a privilege to be able to
work with you in lhe World
Student Service Tund and to,

of our hccrls, thank you.
Sincerely,
Frank G. Sulewski ,
Regional wssr Secretary,

Dear sirs:

This is an appealinol to those
who will read it and take it
it seriously. but lo those who
will not. Those of my friends,
who have heard other of myl
opinions will regard it as a.
joke. This is only proof of a
basic ambivalence in all of us.
First, 1 would like to have il‘
made plain that I would more

crowd, given the right time and
occasion, and that I would be
the first to rebel against the
trend toward "Puritanisln" at
Grinnell.

Unfortunately the people who;
will not read this, are the samel
people who lend to frown on‘
scheduled school events, who,
will not attend Vespers. who willl
not attend music recitals, who,
will not concern ihemselvesl
with art exhibitions, who do nol,
have time to read the editorial'
page, who cannot be bothered to
attend [RC and other important
and educational meetings even‘
when prominent and even emi-,
uenl speakers are featured.
iTlleSe people are definitely in,
the majority—which is the exact
reason why decision-making in

 

 

minority.

These are the very people who
,complain that there is nothing
io do at Grinncll. True, there
is no possibility for a night club
whirl-but there are sufficient
social activites, open houses,
formal and informal dances to
vary the routine. , As adults,
the Grinnell populace cannot ex-
pect to be conslanuy entertained,
but should look toward the sat

isfaction to be derived from the'

broader concern with personal-
ities and events, rather than
things in themselves.

I believe that few of us could
sincerely adopt c hedonistic at-

yet the fact remains that a largel
segment of the student body rec
specf a pseudoVsophistication
whose methodology, conscious or
unconscious, is to belittle any
organized minority activity or
any constituted culhoriiy (eith-l
Er student, faculty, or adminis-
trative) about which they are
uninformed or which lends to
limit their privileges as a “free
agent." This is unequivocally
contrary to an enlightened edu~
cclioncl outlook.

We are not educated if we
ridicule groups and activities to
which We do not belong or to
whose beliefs we do not sub-

activities. in fact. educclioriJ

’say once again from the bollomlWISEi we should respect and ap-

expect to find n school for Cal»
ifornicns in a place like lhis.
‘As a matter of fact, no one from
‘Cclifornia has any business . . .
,oh, What’s the use.

' 1 observed a couple of youths
(staggering back from an after
noon of Grinnell cafe society.
One threw his arm around his
pal’s shoulders and said, “We
,really been havin’ a lotta kicks

=lhc last couple days, huh, Ed?

Just like the vets."

There’s one room in my hall
that looks like c training cage
for young orang-outangs. It is
fitted out with all sorts of de-
vices which are apparently de<
signed to stimulate the growth
or muscle lissue on college men.
These are more commonly called
“dumb-bells."

There are three possible ap-
proaches to the sport of Weight-
lifting. Either the indi idual
has bulk and desires definition,
has definition but desires bulki
or has neither and desires both.
i guess there are some guys
who have both and want more,
but that would be contrary to
the spirit of the thing.

Bulk refers lo any kind of
tissue as long as there is plenty
of it. Definition is the develop-
ment of this tissue into rippling
sinews, some of which have
Latin names.

Such lcrms as “lats, his, and
pecs," are common in the par-
lance of the hoislcrs, as they
like to call themselves. These
colloquialisms, crude as they
may sound, refer to specific
muscles. For example. “la!" is
short for Latissimus Dorsi; “bi”
refers to Biceps Brachii; “pee"
means simply Pectoralis Major.
These are all found on lhe hu-
man body.

The purpose of weight life
ing is to build firm, strong
muscles. There have been many
volumes written on lhc subject
and one of these is used by the
hoisfers in’ my hall. It is called
“Body Building” by Richard
Kline, ‘Hollywood’s Foremost
Builder of Beautiful Bodies.’

Kline may he considered a
favorite with Grinnellians. He
has been credited with building.
Gary Cooper into the Adonis
that he is today. (It says so in

' the book)

other stars who give body
builder Kline credit for their
physiques are Ida Lupino, Dor-
olhy Lumopr, and Bing Crosby.
Of course, no one in the Cowles
Hall Hoisting Club has go n
around lo giving testimon is
yet.

They show their appreciation
of Mr. Kline by flexing (scrik.
ing manly poses) at house
meetings and bull sessions. in
this way they inspire new con-
verls to their cult. In lhe words ‘
of dumb-bell expert Kline, “A
slrong and healthy body is a .
man’s mosl valuable asset."
