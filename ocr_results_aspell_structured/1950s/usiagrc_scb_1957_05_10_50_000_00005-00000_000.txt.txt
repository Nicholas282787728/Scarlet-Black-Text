THE IM
TABULATOR

This has been a busy week in
softball. Six games were played,
and the standings have been
shaken up a bit Cowles is still
riding on top with a 4- 0 count,
but North is 5 l.

Clark dropped from its sec-
and place rating to third with
four wins and one loss. Gates
slipped to fourth with a 34:
record, while Rawson and
Smith are locked in fifth.
Langan is alone in sixth place
with 1-3 and Dibble and South
are battling {or cellar honors,
each having one win apiece
against four losses.

Cowles broke a record Sun-
day as they shellacked South
45o .It was the most runs ever
scored by one team in a single
game. Langan and Dibble tied
1040 and the whole game will
be replayed,

Hurst, from Cowlcs, is cur.
rently leading the league,
batting at n .600 clip. He's be-
ing pushed by teammate Phil
Spelt who‘s hitting .571, Bryan
from Smith is hitting .522 and
Fuller leads the Dibblemen at
.500. As some halls aren’t
keeping records, there could
be some higher averages, but
they aren’t known.

Because of Spring Day, the
golf meet was moved up to later
this week. Barring further post-
ponements, 111 have the results
or that next week. That’s it [or
the 1M standings this week.
