Praised by Critic

A recent book by Prof.
Charles H. roster (English) was
reviewed by Edmund Wilson,
widely known Literary critic
and author, in a long critical
essay in the Sept. 10 New York-
er.

Foster‘s inook, “The lRuinga
less Ladder: Harriet Beecher
Stowe land New England Pun
itanism," emphasizes “the true
importance of Mrs. Stowe,"
Wilson said. “This study may
be something of a landmark,
since it represents the iirst
serious ueﬂ'ort to examine Mrs.
Slmve’s jwhlole work and lit]
present the . growth or her
thought.” .

Wilson credited “The Rungless
Ladder” with “putting ‘Uncle
Tom’s cabin in its proper perm
spectwe in relation to the rest
of her work."

‘Mr. Foster is, so far as I
know, the first writer to do
justice to Mrs. Stowe’s brilliant
book on the Byrons (‘Lady
Byron Vindicated’)."
