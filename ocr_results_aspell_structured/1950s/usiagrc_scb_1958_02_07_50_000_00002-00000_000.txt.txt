The City of Prague

Paulcy said ol' Prague, "The
city was in mourning whilc we
were there because lhe Pr sident
(Antonin Zacolocky) hud just
died a few any brim-e. On
every single building hung a
black flag in at least one wim
dow at every shop (which are,
of course, allv nationalized). there
was a oiclllre and/or a bust of
the dead pi‘eSldcnt" On lhc way
back to Vienna, Pauley saw
huge platforms wilh the Pi '
dent’s poi-mil flanked by Czech
and Russian ilags.

“In iront oi the plnllnrms
were gigllntic bouquets oi
llowers. and standing on liie
platform were soldiers and po—
liccinen nl nticntlon To make
the whole thing more impres-
siye, and in my opinion more
barbaric, there were torches
on lop ol the pillars nt either
side oi the plutlornis."
