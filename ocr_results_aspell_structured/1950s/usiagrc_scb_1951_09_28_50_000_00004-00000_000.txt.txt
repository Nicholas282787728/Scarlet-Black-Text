thinking fellow he might prepare

poi-tent and profitable. It's a'
great chance.for the administra ’

tiun to make it first Impression _

and I believe that they did just~
that. First impressions like that
don't usually fade away so
quickly, but we might coinrortl
ourselves with the thought them
there will be other freshman
classes to greet. ‘

As a rule, orinnell convoca-
tions have provided an excellent
opportunity for the faculty, stu~
dents, and our president to get
to know each other in an atmos-
phere of academic torina tyl

Jtisl didn’t have it i

For one thing, the whole Cere-l
mony seemed pointless, The cnl
tire freshman class must he‘
uondei-ing why they were call~
ed together: eonvoked, it could

' not have been to hear about our
five marvelous painters or thej
lgt‘eat sacrifices of the gang at
Okoboji. These kids were cer-,

mly deserving at even ning

they got; is that what a Convos
C.” on is for?

Did they herd us into that'
place to tell us about the Cut
sadc for Freedom. or about the
cost of room and board at Iowa,
College in 1851 (without heating
stove)? Did we scuit up our
precious basketball lloor that we
might be told that our football
team has a chance this year and
that we slloula all get out there
and yell ourselves hoarse (which
is going to be a downright
pleasure and always was wliethe
or we won or lost)? I don't
think so and 1 hope that none
at the new students think so.

People wouldn’t be people if
they didn't make mistakes. Soon
there will be another coiwocae
tion and maybe our rrcshmcnl
will give us a chance to'show
them what a Grinnell convoca—
tion is really like. They look
like a forgiving bunch.
