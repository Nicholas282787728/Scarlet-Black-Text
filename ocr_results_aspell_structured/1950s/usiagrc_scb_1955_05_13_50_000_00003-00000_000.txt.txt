Track Team Besis Waﬁburg'

Nex’r Faces Teachers, Corn

The Pioneer traokmen face
two tough opponents in dual
meets before the Midwest con»
ference track championships
May 20-21 at Carelton. Tomor-
row the squad journeys to Cedar
Falls to meet Iowa State Teach-
ers and next Tuesday invades
Cornell at Mt. Vernon.

Grinnell edged the Tutors in
an indoor meet this spring by
511/2-481/2. Last Tuesday Teachr
ers tipped Cornell 741/2-56Vz to
end the Rams’ four meet win-
ning streak. since Cornell best-
ed Grinnell last Saturday in a
triangular with Cue, the Pioneer
outfit will be had‘ pressed to
take both meets.

in last week’s track activity
the cindermen finished second
to Cornell and ahead of Coe in
the triangular meet, and then
last Wednesdak ran over Wart-
burg 77-54.

The iinal tally in last satur-
day’s meet showed Cornell with
75 points, Grinnell as, and Coe
18. Grinnell counted most heav-
ily in the distances with Dave
Qutub copping the two-mile,

Frank Hays Has
Top Record As
Quarter-Miler

by Denny Watson

Frank Hays, North Younker
senior, is one young man who
apparently feels more at ease
with a pair of track shoes on
than anything else. This is evi-
denced by the fact that he has
been participating in track for
ten years and in the past sev—
eral years has run practically
the year round.

lszedy Mile Quartet

Frank has an outstanding recr
ord as a member oi Grinnell
relay teams, notably the mile re—
lay team of which he is a four--
year member. This team took
top honors at the conierence
two years ago and this year has
taken firsts in the Drake Relays,
CoeACornell— Grinnell triangular
and all of the dual meets so far
this year.

This is the second fastest mile
quartet in the school’s history
and Frank stated, “it would be
the biggest thrill of the year for
me if we could top the carrier
record this year". The standing
record is 3:235 set by Cornell
in 1925.

Likes Competition

Frank turned the tables on
coach E. G. Booth, who usually
makes newspaper statements
about the cindermen, and said,
“E. G’s dynamic approach to
building up spirit and interest in
the sport deserves real credit,
His interest in putting us in
higher competition has been a
benefit to the whole team.
our full schedule is exemplary
of his attitude. Personally I like
competition and I’d prefer loosing
to a top notch school than run—
,ning all over a poorer school.”

Frank is a policital science
major and considering a teach-
and coaching career after obtain-
ing his masters‘ in education at
Western Reserve University. His
extra-curricular activities in-
clude a photography hobby, glee
club, the Frank Hays Combo and
Honor G, not to mention cross-
country and track.

and Jim Kingland the half.
Against warliburg the Scarlet
squad was victorious in ten of
fifteen events as numerous meet
records were posted. one of the
meet’s better performances was
George Drake's 4:217 clocking
in the mile. Charlie Westrup was
a double winner in the hurdles.

Golfers Top Coe
For Second Will

Fresh from a 121/2-2113 victory
over Coe, the Pioneer golfers
take on Drake today in Des
Moines. The squad returns home
Monday for a meet with Iowa
State Teachers.

Omaha handed the linksmen a
trouncing last Saturday at the
Grinnell country club, uni—2h.
The best Grinnell individual
score was Jim Anderson’s 78,
good for a tie with Radjk. In
the C08 meet Jim GabrieleonK
and Dick Von ’Maur came
through with 76’s to pave the
Way.

Teachers should be the touth
est ol the two opponents, as the.
Pioneers attempt to bring their
season record above the .500
mark before the conference
meet next weekend at One.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Both Omaha and Coe fell Vic-
tims to the Grinnell tennis team
last week to give the Pioneer
team a 6-1 record for the sear
son.

Due to disciplinary reasons,
Omaha, previously undefeated,
was able to send only three

players here last Friday and
forfeited four matches to lose
5-2, Tuesday the Pioneers
swamped Coe 9—0, all matches
going only two sets.

Today the Pioneers have a
very important match against
Carleton. one of the favorites
in the approaching conference
tournament May 2021 at Law—
rence. On Saturday the Oles

You GE! MORE deeprdow'n smoking enjoyment from Luckia
than any other brand. The reason, plain and sixhple, is that
Luckies taste better. They taste better, ﬁrst of all, because
Lucky Strike means fine tobacco. Then that tobacco is
toasted to taste better. “It’s Toasted”~the famous Lucky
Strike processitoiies up Luckies‘ light) good-tasting tobacco
to make it taste even better . . . cleaner, fresher, smoother.
You‘ll enjoy the Droodle above, too; it‘s titled: Three on a
match—Luckies, of course. Whenever smokers put their
heads together, they agree you can’t mulch 3 Lucky for ﬂavor.

Come light-up time, enjoy a better-tasting Lucky yourself!
