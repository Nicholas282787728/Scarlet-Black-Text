A May Day Observation

Yesterday afternoon the Grinnell detachment of the
Air Force ROTC held a retreat on central campus. Among
other reasons, the review was held in order to make pre-
sentations of awards to cadets who were considered out-
standing during the first semester,

The ceremony was fairly well atttended by the “Union
,crowd," who evacuated their second home for the affair,
and by several faculty members who happened by. In the
minority were those who had actually planned to Witness
the event

A retreat is a serious
it, and should he to those observing it. Yesterday,
ever, the onlookers didn’t seem to find it so.

Throughout the entire ceremony, including the playing
of the national anthem, the lowering of the ﬂag, and the
presentation of awards, loud and annoying remarks could
he heard from several viewers. These remarks ranged from
“Three cheers for the hammer and sickle," yelled by one
sophomolic junior girl, to a bevy of horse laughs.

we wonder if this is the general attitude of the aver-
age Grinnell student towards his country. We hope not! We
sincerely hope that the disrespect shown was for attention-
getting purposes, and not seriously intended.

Possibly, if our “hammer and sickle girl” were in Rus»
sia and had caused such a disturbance, she would not have
found it taken so lightly. If it weren’t for our American
heritage, and the Armed Forces formed to protect this
heritage, which our young friend seems to take so lightly,
she may have had difficulty in so freely expressing herself,
The men that she and others were ridiculing are the ones
that will protect their freedom of speech iin the future.

We hope that if she and others will reevaluate their
actions of yesterday, they will see them in a different light.
Perhaps next time they contemplate laughing at the Stars
and Stripes they will think twice American freedom and
American heritage are something to be proud of and fought
for, not something to be laughed at.

By Paul nus:

Immediately alter writing this,
I am going to flee the son
office, don dark glasses, and
hide the rest of the day. My ed»
itor, you see, isn’t going to like
it: she has a review of the
“Malteaser” elsewhere,, and
would just as soon not devote
an entire issue of her paper to
it. i can’t blame her, actually.

But rm hung up; there
seem to he iew hunting is-
sues this week, and I haven’t
much else to helabor. The food
has been decent of late, the
campus police have not been
unduly severe, and at this
moment, I feel there is little
about (kind! to get nasty
about, Except this magazine.

Before going on, I think it
would be best to label the “Mall-
teasei-r” The words of introduc-
tion at the front of the magas
zine (something vague about
womb: and water) fail to state
whether it is 3 humor mega,
zine, or an organ of criticism,
or a collection of smudgy line
drawings, or what. We cannot,
like Big Jule, say “Either way}’

I don‘t think it can be
termed :1 humor magazine;
the only aspect of the “Mal-
teaser" that I round musing
were the typing errors and
the pretentious hit about trap-
ping and examining Grinnell
social lifei No. Humor maga»
zine will not do.

I think we would do better
to regard the thing as a parody
on a college humor magazine.
Regarded in this light, the “ll/Isl-
teaser” is r , , ah . , . almost
tolerablei

But, taken as a serious at-
tempt at humor, (as, I sup—
pose, its editors look it) at
criticism and art, it is atro-
cious. It is humorless; it is
artless; it is pointless. 1 leave

Pot Pourri
Jazz’Expressions‘ Explored
Under Hancock's Leadership

By Stephen Levin
This evening, an experiment will be attempted on this
campus, performed by a 19—piece student band directed by

Herb Hancock Jazz is the experiment, and, interestingly,
its vitality lies in the fact that it is inherently groping for
new means of expression.

The burden of technical re—
sponsibility in jazz is shifted
irom the composer of a musical
expression of the executor of
it. Jazz would die if the quals
lties of improvisation were to
be taken from it.

Quite obviously, the smaller
3 jazz group, the more lati-
tude there is for the kind of
improvisation We have been
talking about Grinnellians
Hancock, Bjal‘ne Nielsen,
Dave Kelsen and Boll Preston
formed a quartet lzst year.
They tried to excite a tremcn»
dous unity, ordered by a uni-
quc variety,

The experiment progressed
rather sketchily, although the
fellows liked playing together.
Then, as a more integrated
sound was being nurtured, a _
feeling that the group should Lawn

have been moving touard a
concrete goal was aired. The
Student Council granted the
funds by which the first, Grim
nell jazz colloquium could pos-

Sibly brcome a reality,

To guide the administrative
destinies ol the venture, a
student planning committee
was formed; mnny dissenting
votes were cast as to the
gonerul theme that the col-
loquium should assume. The
synthesis is that some of the
directions in which jazz is
headed today will be portray-
ed. One must remember that
jazz is an art torm which is
vitally and indigenously
American, and to a great de-
gree a reflection of our way

it to the reviewer to go
through the magazine page by
awful page; i don’t lecl up to
cataloguing the lower toms of
journalism. Allow me one ex-
ample, thong me which per-
feotly exempliﬁes the “Mal-
teaser" and its editors’ ideas
of fun: the lull-page picture
or Blair lulu. An entire page
or an already-looslim maga-
zine wasted, just so some
clown could work “so" into it.
Keen minds were at work
there . , .

It would lie nice to finish this
with a wan smile and an ad-
monition to try, try again. But
I can‘t manage a smile, and I
am certainly hesitant about
spurring the editors on to fur-
ther effort, 1 only hope they
exhausted themselves with their
ﬁrst effort.
