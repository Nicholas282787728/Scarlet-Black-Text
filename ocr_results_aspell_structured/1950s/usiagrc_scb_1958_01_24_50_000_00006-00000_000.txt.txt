,TAXI DRIVING, at best, is a checkered career. Some
days, nothing seems to click—including the meter!
Trafﬁc crawls, ,motor stalls, horns bleat, bumpers
meet. What a moment to reach for a Lucky—and
discover (horrors!) you’re fresh out. That’s when the
most genial driver turns into a Crabby Cabby. And
Why not? He’s missing the best taste going . . . a
cigarette that’s light as they come. Luckies are all
light tobaccomgood-tasting tobacco, toasted to
taste even better. Try ’em yourself. And step on it!

C'NION MAC, TAKE IT EASY

January 24,

It's customary, at this time of
year—last issue and au, for an
editor to say “it’s been great"
and ”thanks a lot all you who
helped me.”

Well, aside from having to
prod Madgett and Bacchus every
week, I suppose it has been a
pretty good tenure . But,
where. might 1 be so bold as to
wonder, could everyone have
been last Saturday when the
basketball team lost to Carle—
ton by two points~in what was
the seeond most exciting bas-
ketball game I’ve ever seen? The
first was four nights earlier
when we fought from a ten-
point deficit to beat Olaf 59-57,
under like conditions.

I‘m happy to relinquish this

Bill McClintock (No. 44) blocks column because I'm sick of hear-

teammate George Mdimsey.

ing myself plead for better at-
tendance and school spirit. It
couldn’t be that mose who
stayed home on Saturday did
so in anticipation of a dull eve,
ning. Grinnellians have never
witnessed more exciting games.

I realize, now, that those I've
attempted to reach are hardly
those who would bother with
the column. 1 give up.

Being spans editor of a news-
paper run by women, one of a
college which frequently de-
emphastzes, when not under—
mining, sports, is often an un»
pleasant job. Many were the
times when I thought an ath-
letic event was deserving of a
more prominent position than
page five. Many were the times
when I thought sports—in com-
parison with some of the other
material (ie . l . a feature on
“How To Tie A Beau”)—~was
deserving of more than two
small pages. Life gets pretty
frustrating.

Yet, there always seems to be
compensation for one’s woes.
The feeling I got as I walked
into Derby last Saturday, hav-
ing just returned from Knox.
was just that. Mr. Mendoza call-
ed me from his seat in the
bleachers and anxiously
asked for a report on the Pier
neer-Siwash swim meet. i won-
der it he has missed a sports
event since coming to Grinnell.

Mr. Russell’s been a timer or
judge at track and swim meets
for years. Can’t remember a
football game at which Pres-
cott Wasn’t. Mr: Easy and the
Ludwigs—to mention a few~
continually follow and support
our teams.

I renumerated the results for

,Mendoza last Saturday, and his ,

interest made me feel good.
Well, Bill (McClung) and Joe
(Walka), she’s all yours. And if
I sound bitter, im really not.

Being a sports editor is a great,

and often gratifying experience.
