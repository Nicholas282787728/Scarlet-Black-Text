By Aloysius O'chan

In a ,chummy little conversa-
tion with Grinnell’s transplant—
ed Texan, basketball coach John
Pfitscli, he told this department
that he regarded this year‘s ver»
sion of the Pioneer cage team
as “. . . at least 25% b9ttel‘ than
the 1948—49 outfit,”

Silent John went on to say
that although this Season's over—
all mark of ll»7 is not as good
on a percentage basis as the
12—5 record set a year ago, thei
Pioneers have tangled with
much tougher trams such as
Iowa State and Kansas Wesle-
yan. than was the case during
his first season in charge of the
Scarlet and Black quintet.

“There‘s the home court
angle, too," added Pfitsch. “We
played 1,1 contests on the road
this year and only seven in
Darby. Last season the boys
were at home eight times and
away for nine contests.”

”Our offensive average was
up 131 points per game over
the 1948—49 figure, in spite of
the defensive niark rising 3
points, the difference between
the two averages is 4,5 points
as compared with last year's
O.A.-D.A. difference of 1.7."

Grinnell’s free throw percene‘
tage of 68.6 gave the Pioneers
second place among the nation‘s:
small college teams in that dee
partment.

When humbly questionedi
about the future, Mr. Pfitseh‘
smiled bravely and trotted out
the “its." “If all of this season‘s
eligible squadmen return, and
if the freshmen come up as ex»‘
pected. Grinnell will be able
to cause' a lot of people a lot of
trouble . . , if . ,

Ben Douglas, formerly varsity‘
football boss at Grinnell, has‘
been named to coach centers
and kickers for Raffensberger
at the State University of Iowa,

. . Dave Dunlop was a unan—
imous choice for one of thel
forward berths on the all—cone}
ference team named by Midwest‘
coaches Glenn SaundersL
was a second team choice andl
Bob Bigelow received honorable,
mention . . .
