LANTERN SUGGESTS CHANGE

Committee Appointed To Draw Up
’ Plan and to Consider Bids;
Facility Must Act.

At a special meeting of the student
Council last Saturday afternoon lav»
orable action was taken on a resolu-
tion presented by Lantern asking that
the control of college dances be take
on from the recreation committee and
given to individual students as a pri—
vate enterprise. .

Before the proposed plan will be
formally adopted by the Council, ac-
tion must be taken by the social cour—
niiftee of the faculty and rererrcd to
the faculty for approval. It these
groups take favor-able action on the
plan the Strident Council will ride
vertise for bids and the new system
will be put into operation for the sec-

, ond semester or the present year,

The tentative plan under considel'nr
tion is to take tlrc college dances,
vars y and formals, from the recre. -
tion committee and grant m Concess
sion to a small group of students
who will be responsible for the car»

g on of the social program for
the school as a whole. Any deficit iii-
crii-r-cd in staging a dance will be
borne by the individuals in cllnrge,I
likewise airy profit derived from the
danccs will go to the men in charge.

Responsible to Council

Tire student Council will have the
right to eke the franchise at any
time for a . olation of the agreement
The committee will be directly rec
spoiisible at all tinrcs to the Student
Council for maintaining a prescribed
standard for orchestras and the gen-
eral levels of all dances Tire matter
of admissions will-be taken care of
in the final draft, but the Council
feels that a strict regulation must be
made iii regard to it.

Tlle Resolution

’llle folloiiing resolution was
adopted by the members of Lantern
at a meeting held Wednesday night,
January 16:

President of Strident Council.

Tire Lantern unanimously voted to
recommend to the StudentConncil
that the control of college dances be
taken from the recreation committee
and given to individual students who
will sponsor dances as private en-
ter-prises yet still being responsible
to the Student Council.

Elton Follett, Sec'y.

A committee consisting of Harris
Coggcshall, chairman, Howard Peck,
Dorothy Wiscman and Frances Fropp
was appointed by Laurence .Lunden.

‘ president of the student Coirncil, to
draw. up a formal plan governing the
nroposcdtehangc. This committee will

so receive and investigate bids from
individuals or groups who wish to
place a bid with the student council
tor the franchise. Bids should he in
by Friday noon.

Facility action will be reported
within a few days and the Strident
Council will hold a meeting to adopt
the plan of the committee and hear
their recommendations on bids.

day, under the direction of Professor
0, L. Pierce, madc one of the most
enjoyable programs or the year. All
the subleties that distinguish the ar-
tistic creation from the product of
the class room were eiident in his
work, which ranged from a vocal arr
rangcmcnt of Tcnnyson‘s "Crossing
the Bar” for the men's choir to three
organ solos played by himself,

"Romance," an arrangement for the
. ring quartet, was interpreted with
their usual skill, and illristrated rid»
nrirably the melodic powers of Pros
fessor Blum's work. This number.
with its delicate, constantly percent-
ible movement. made a pleasant lllir
pr ssion upon the audience.

“Summer Night," sung by the Worlds
en's Glee club, was delightfully ar-

‘ranged, and its charm enhanced by

the solo work of Miss Leah Pratt. An
anthem for the entire Vesper choir,
"Bow Down Thine Eyes,” with Arline
Urban as soloist, was effective both in
presentation and in actual musical
content. “Crossing the Ear," because
of the intcrwoven harmony of the
men's voices, was perhaps one of the
most popular numbers given,

The organ solos which Professor
Blum played himself were symbolic
or the whole program, exhibiting to
the frillest capacity the variety of his
mood and expression.

Professor Blum has been connected
with the faculty of the Grinnell
school or music for some years, exe
cept for a short timespent as head of
the School of Music at Des Moines

MARQUE'I‘TE LEADS AT HALF

Minier Is High Point Man In Rally
Second Half;.‘1‘hree Men Go

A brilliant second half spurt by the
Pioneers, led by "Red" Minier, was
not enough to overhaul Marquette's
early lead in the basketball game in
Milwaukee Monday night and the Hill»
toppers took a two point victory by
a score of 27 to 25. Thus the “Golds
cn Avalanche" detest on the gridiron
last fall by Crinnell was avenged.

Inability to sink free throws cost
the Pioneers the game against the
Marquette five. Although the fouls
were evenly divided between the two
teams, Crinnell was able to counterm-
ly seven out of a possible fourteen
while Marquette amassed a total of
eleven points on gilt shots alone.

The first half belonged to Mar-
oiiettc and at half time Grinnell trail-
ed by a score of 19 to lo. King was
largely responsible for this early
lead, getting aivay for four baskets
and four free throws while the Pio-
necrs were watching his steller team-
mate, O‘Donnell, Marquette took the
lead in to opuing minutes of play and’
was never headed during the first
period.

Tire second half saw Cr-inncll start-
