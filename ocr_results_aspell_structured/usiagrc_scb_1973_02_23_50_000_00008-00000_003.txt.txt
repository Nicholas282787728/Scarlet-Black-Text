Terror

Something beyond just an ordinary splash;
A whole wave sommersaulting you, drowning you,
Twirling, no direction, no air,
rrantic kick, move! Now
tied in a straitjacket, defenseless
People surround, knives in their hands,
Backed in a corner, no place to go,
strain the knot! Now
Down a road in lonesome darkness
Where’s IT coming trom? legs won’t move
come on! and ITS closer, pressing,
Have to wake up! New
Swimming the road straightjacketed,
just get I where sate hands reach me,
pull me to shore, untle the knot,
I'll be 0K...g0tta get there,
gotta get there...

The Photographer ‘

Scattered bodies he still on the gutted earth.
No wind disturbs their sleep;

Only the weighted movement

or silence between the clicks or my camera.

I trap them in a stillness more still than death.

My shadow lengthens as I take

The field in cautious steps.

The brown winter grass slowly darkens into gray.
At the toot of a hill, my eyes stop.

Before me on a blasted taknk

Before me on a blasted tank,

A skull sits, helmeted in readiness.

I lift my lens and peer through glass

At the dark eidolon. Beyond sight

It compels me, works through my ﬂesh
Blindly to the bone. I struggle through the lens
Searching for what lies hidden

In the stare of blank sockets at an empty sky.
Beneath dead ﬂesh and bone.

Now the Wind is no longer Still.

In an instant cracked lips take breath
And the terrible, unlormed cry

Of a young man breaks; ﬂares

Into a thousand echoing screams.

Mortar shells piercing through cold steel and tlesh,

My camera drops at my side.

I clamp Shut my ears with trembling hands.
Useless too, they cannot stay the sound.

My body takes root and will not move,

For what was hidden has now surrounded me;
I am amidst a choir of the dead.

Taken by the sound, cacaphony ceases.
It ascends to unison and then to song.

I am litted to a world beyond light
Made pure by the sound of human being.
I kneel without eyes and am accepted.

I become song among the hills.

But now the wind is dying, and song

Sinks through pain to silence.

I (eel my knees grow cold upon the ground.
I open slow my eyes

And return to a world OI light.

Before me, the skull sits on the tank.

No sound breaks Irom its lips,

I am trapped in a stillness more still than death.

We are too easily lost
in the Suund
OI our own

Futile thrashing

OI the air

In search 01 our Selves

Credo

In the beginning was the tear
And the tear was god
And the tear was with god
it fell to the earth
And softened the Stones
And dug the oceans
And irorn it sprung man
and that's why we cry
For tears are God

You pull away, just beyond reach,

On The Connecticut Coast

In the november dusk ’
The grey waters of the bay lap up

Onto the barnacled

rocks and limp reeds,

A woman walks along the shore,

Her wind breaker

barely moving in the cool air.

Out, about a hundred feet,
A man and a boy are fishing in a wooden rowboat.
Their poles mark an angle above the water as

Long, low movem

ents DI the bay push the boat up and down.

The woman watches them
As they driIt in the hay.
They gaze at the quiet water

Waiting to receive

the 593’s oIi'spring.

NOW the dark is coming in
And their Iigures begin to recede.

She watches on till

she can no longer see them

And there is the sound of water upon the rocks.

The woman turn

5 and makes her way back up the shore.
