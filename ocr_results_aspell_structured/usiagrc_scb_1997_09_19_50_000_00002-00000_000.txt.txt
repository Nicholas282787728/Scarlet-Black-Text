”Stonewalleoalition expands in size and reach,

BY RYAN OLSON
Staff Writer

Although Grinnell is generally
viewed as a safe space for gay, les-
bian, bisexual, and transgendered
(GLBT) individuals, many students
of all sexualities seek support from
the various groups aﬁilliated with the
Stonewall Coalition (Stonedo).

‘stoneco, which is centered in the
Stonewall Resource Center located
in the YMCA buiding. provides a
place for GLBT students and their
straight allies to “become active in
the pursuit of equality across this
campus and elsewhere,“ explained
Patrick Saunders ‘00. coeAll Groups
Coordinator.

The coalition includes many sub—
committees such as the Stonewall
Speakers Bureau. the political activ-
ism sub-committee, the social
cooridmation subcommitee, and the
study break/ education subcommit-
tee. It also remains in contact with
various afﬂiated groups such as the
Queers of Color discussion group,
the Wednesday night discussion

Grinnell, but it has not yet decided
on the ﬁnal candidate.

The MinorityeScholarsein-Resi»
dence program grew out of Black
Scholars/Professionals in Residence
Committee that was established in
1986 to increase the number of black
professionals on campus.

In 1991 the scope of the commit-
tee broadened and was renamed the
"Minority-Scholarsvianesidence
Program" meaning that the commit-_
tee would bring not only African
American scholars but also Asian
American, Latina/o and Native
American scholars to Gi‘innellDean
Scott attributes the program to help—
ing “make Grinnell more Visible to
minority scholars," she said. “Their
presence at Grinnell increases the di-

group, and the Coming Out Group.

Saunders and Sarah Farber ‘01,
who were elected as Stoneco’s two
All Groups Coordinators, will coor-
dinate group meetings and act as the
group‘s campus liasons, They will
also organize the various subgroups
and maintain Stoneco‘s mailing list
which informs the campus of local,
state, national, and global GLBT—re-
lated issues

After roughly 40 people attended
the ﬁrst meeting ofihe year on Sun-
day, September 7. the co-
cooridinators are optimistic about
this year. ”Last year we only had
approximately 2530 active mem-
bers," explained Saunders,

Many students may have noticed
the abundance of flyers and other
notices explaining Stoneco and its
activities across the campus.

Saunders said that “we are look
ing to make sure that students know
that Stoneco and the Stonewall Rev
source Center are not entirely queer-
only areas. All people are welcome
to come to our meetings, or to just
hang out at the SRC.”

versity in the campus as well as in
the faculty and the cun‘iculum. The
program is not the only or the best
way of increasing diversity on cam-
pus, but it is something positive."

ﬁne, and I do, too. The discrepancy
is a little bit silly."

Although the laws may prevent
numerous underage drinkers from
purchasing alcohol. business has still
been brisk, Sadler and Phelps said.

“We‘re actually up a little bit from
last year," Sadler said. ”I think we’ve
been up because we’ve had less
specails. Our sales are up, but maybe
we're selling less alcohol."

“ The new laws haven't affected
us since the beginning ofthe semes-
ter,“ Phelps said, “We're running
ahead of normal."

This year, the group hopes to cre-
ate a comfortable social and politi-
cal environment by celebrating Gay
Pride Week and National Coming
Out Day, and by organizing study
sessions, meetings, and other activt-
ties for all students.

Many of Stoneco's subcommit-
tees and afﬁliated groups, however,
are focusing on more serious issues
that affect the emotional and politi-
cal aspects of people’s lives. One
afﬂiate helps individuals with the
“coming out" process. The Stone»
wall Speakers Bureau, a sub—group,
is working to broaden its audience.

The Speakers' Bureau (Speakers)
is reaching beyond the conﬁnes of
Grinnell College this semester, With
presentations scheduled at the Lieue
tenant Governor‘s Fair on Diversity
and at the University of Iowa. “We
educate about heterosexism and hoe
mophobia," said member ﬁridie
Roberts ‘00.

l Although its primary audience is
high school groups. the conservative
structure of many schools has lead
the Speakers Bureau to branch out.

According to Grinnell Police Cape
tain Darrel Lamb, the new laws have
not affected the number of students
caught for drinking underage.

“The new Iowa law is going to
help because of stiffer penalties. but
we haven’t seen any changes." he
said. The police department has not
been patrolling the bars any more
than usual, according to Lamb.

Some students feel that they have
been affected negatively by the new
laws.

“I think it shifts the responsibility
ofthe laws to the owner and the bare
tender when it should be the responr
sibility of the underage drinker," an
anonymous 19~yeareold said.

“it's made it really hard to buy
alcohol," another IQ-yearold student
said.

 

The Speakers’ Bureau‘s time slot
at the Diversity Fair “is interesting
when you consider how conservative
the lieutenant governor is," said Rob-
erts.

Last year, “we spoke in Des
Moines to theYoung Women‘s Feniie
nist Core, which Brldic founded,”
Saunders, who is also a member of
the group, said.

Last year. Speakers addressed
Central College in Pella, Iowa,
“They have a very strong Christian
group at Central,“ Saunders said.
“Strangely enough, there was a big
meeting ofihe Christian group at the
same time as we were there, so they
did not come to our presentation."

In more conservative environe
ments, the Speakers’ Burcaii aims to
provide “a livmg counterexample to
the belief that homosexuals are sine
ful and wrong. Here we are, produc-
tive members of society," Roberts
said. “Helping people ﬁnd a place,
helping to stop the unfairness, that’s
what we’re about,”

The organization will not take its
standard approach at the University

ish students on campus, Brin will
help plan the budget and calendar.
Erin will not just bring tangible re
sources to Grinnell. Elisa Kaplan ‘
01, who met Rabbi Brin, said, ”I
think Rabbi Erin will bring new en,
ergy into the organization."

Chalutzim leader Rachel Weiss
described the relationship between
Grinnell and Rabbi Brin as “a great
match." She said that Rabbi Brin has
an attitude of “tolerance,
acceptingness, and open-
mindedness." Weiss said that al-
though Brin is ”specifically attuned
to the needs ofiewish students," she
will “serve the entire community as
a whole."

Professor Sandy Goldberg of the
Philosophy department was able to

Goldberg saw in Brin “ a deser to

on various aspects ofJudaism, but a
sensitivity to the diverse interests and
levels of knowledge of our students
here; a genuine respect for the kind

vate among oiir students "

Brin will participate in the plan
ning ofthe Kabbalat Shabbat, which
is a service in Steiner. Kabbalat
Shabbat has been traditionally led by
faculty and staff, but now the duties
will be divided up between Rabbi
Erin and the former leader's.

a few people very strongly."

The Coming Out Group [COG] is
it completely conﬁdential organiza-
tion, No names OngOLlp members or
meeting times are revealed to people
outside ofthc group itself. Ari anony-
mous coo representative stated that
“The Coming Out Support Group has
been rcstarted [this year] after a lapse
in it's activity. It began in response
to several students‘ need for a conﬁe
denttal space on campus to discuss
coming out issues. COG serves as a
peer support group in which students
ciiil meet others who are going
through similar questions and
searches."

“The Coming Out Support group
is completely conﬁdential; its meete
ing location, day, and time only dise
closctl to members of‘the group, Its
forum is that of open discussion in a
peer facilitated group."

"In forming COG, it was hoped
that the group would informally unite
students at all stages of the coming
out process, supporting students as
they encounter difﬁculties, exciting
discoveries, and new questions.”

Brin will also assist in other
Chalutzim activities, such as Shabbat
Table and High Holy Days services.

Shabbat Table is a weekly dinner
in which students cook and eat
Shabbat dinner together. It is held in
a private dining room at Cowles, and
is open to all students.

High Holy Days are twelve days
surrounding the holidays of Rosh
Hashanah and Yom Kippur. During
these days, a student from Hebrew
Union College in New York will be
in Grinnell to lead services, as well
as presenting workshops and discus-
sions.

Other Chalutzim activities that
Brln will undoubtedly be involved in
include bringing speakers and musi-
cal groups to carnpus, Jewish Cul-
ture Week, and Jewish Food Bazaar.
