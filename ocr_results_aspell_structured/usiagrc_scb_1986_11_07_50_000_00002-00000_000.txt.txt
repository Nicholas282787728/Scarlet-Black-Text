Behind-the-Scenes in Congress

U.S.
Congress:
Energy and
Efficiency _
Required

by Dawn Helsing

I am ashamed to admit it, but until this
summer my knowledge oi Congress was
based on the “Schoolhouse Rock” version
of “how a bill becomes a law." So. if
nothing else. I knew that my summer as a
congressional intern would be a learning
experience

When I iinally got past the security
guards. eray machines. and metal detecr
tors at the entrance to the Longworth
House Office Building. I expected to find
myself in something like the Oval Office.
Instead. I was standing in the middle of a
maze oi echoing hallways lined with
numbered. identical wooden doors.

Like some freshman rooms at Griiinell.

Congress tend to be small and crowded

staff of nine. which was split between two

consisted of the Legislative Director.

It didn't take me more than a week to
learn that a Member of Congress would be
lost without an efficient staff. The various
staff members brief the Member on up-
coming legislation, impormnt issues. com-
mittee hearings, and happenings in the
district. They meet with lobbyists and
answer the piles of constituent letters that
are delivered to the office four times a day,
In other words, the staff is responsible for
all the behind—the-scenes legwork that
enables every Member of Congress to
smile. shake a few hands. and vote with
the confidence that his final decisions are
informed and responsibly made.

Bundestag:
Quite
Different
from U.S.

by Kristina Scott 7

A staff of two and no computer? My first
day as an intern with a member of the
Bundestag, the West German parliament.
brought several surprises,

I had worked for Senator Charles
Grassley the summer of was and so when I
started work for Representative Hans
Peter Schmitz in February of this year. i
had expected a similar experience I was
wrong.

First of all. going to work on the banks of
the Rhine has its advantages over
downtown D.C. The rooHop buiiei

century palace with, if you're lucky. the
Cologne Cathedral on the skyline. beats
the dim cafeteria in the basement of Hart
Senate Office Building,

Secondly. Bonn doesn’t have a Capital.
Germans cannot construct a parliament
building as under their constitution every
meetingrplace oi the Bundestag is to be
provisional until Germany is reunited
Slnce 1949 the Bundestag has convened in
the former teacher’s college of Bonn
University Within the next year. the
Bundestag \\'lll be relocated to a renovated
nineteenth century waterrprocessing
plant.

Security is fighter in Bonn than in DC. I
had to wait two weeks for a security
clearance. I’m still curious as to what they
found out about me

The debates in the Bundestag are less
accessible to the general public that Con»
gressionai ones, it Hans Meier (“Joe
Blow” in Germanl wishes to watch a
parliamentary debate. he has to request
permission in writing a year ahead of
time

One oi my primary responsibilities was
the preparation oi policy summaries. Such
tasks are oi particular importance in the
German parliamentary system where
representatives tend to focus on one mar
row issue area. When Mr. Schmitz had to
speak on an issue he knew little about. I
would be given three or four hours in
research the issue and present a policy
summary. '

As a second task I helped plan the first
direct mailing campaign to be used in Mr.
Schmitz’ district. This involved computer-
shopping. The oiiices of the represenr
tatives are just now getting computerized.
‘Many Germans feel computers are job
killers. Consequently. politicians have
been hesitant to adopt new technologies.

German politicians are much more able
to work without computers or large staiis
as they have little constituent mail to pro
cess. The dominance oi the political par-
ties relieves the individual representatives

tion, the parties perform most oi the
research and policy iormulation.

A work of advice — if you'd like to be an
intern. try Washington first. American
representatives all have interns, for in-
ternships can be sources oi potential sup-
porters or aides. political iavors, or good
public relations. As German represen-
tatives are less individual candidates and
decisionrmakers as they are members oi a
party. the above incentives for hiring iii-
terns are not as strong. Bonn interns may
not have less fun. but they do miss-out on
