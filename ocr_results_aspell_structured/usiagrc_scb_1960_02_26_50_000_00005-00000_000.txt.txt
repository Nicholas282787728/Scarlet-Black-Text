in his second lecture Saud-
rnann pointed out that very
little is actually known about
the solar system. one oi the
things which is recognized,
however, is that there is a
“high degree oi physical sym—
inctry.”

about the solar system through}
radiation received here on earth.
He stressed that man, ivithi
nah-ed eye and telescope, can

sce only a \‘ei'y small band at
the radiation spectrum, and this
has restricted solar investiga—
tion.

The two main sources of our
knowledge of the solar system,
Sandmann said, are Conlcts,l
which we can observe with the
eye and telescope, and meter
orites, which come to earth and
are closely studied in the lab-
oratory.

It has been determined, he
said, that (ml-nets, which all
he in a hand about to astrtr
notmical units from
are members or the solar sy5r
tern. They are composed or
water, methane and ammonia,
irozen in a loose aggregate
with a mixture of heavy
solids.

‘ .When comets come near the

earth, they grow under the in.
‘tluenee or the sun, and the
turbulent, gaseous tails stream
away from the sun, Ashersclcn-
tists can now. describe the
'mechanics oi comets and pre-
dict the growth and movement
—oi their tails,

iAccording to Sandmann, mete-l
”miles. are considered to be on
solartorigin because they enter’
the earth’s atmosphere at a vu—
locityj lower than escape velo ~-
'ity, The meteorites‘ home is a
belt between Mars and Jupiter,
where collisions of
planets formed the meteorites
.about loo million years ago.
The elements in meteorites are
,ca‘lcuiated to be about four and
one alt billion years old.

In his last lecture Wednes-
day‘pSandmann said that we
can use as .modcls ior study
oi the condensation theory of

, the origin or the solar system,
thezsatellitcs oi Jupiter and
urahus_which spread out in
the 2 same density as the
planets do rrom the sun—
Saturu and the Earthsmuoll
system.

i-lepointed out that we can
inalre‘ predictions about the
Earth-like planets oi Mercury.=
,Venus, and Mars irom a study‘
of the Earth. One such prodic
tion that can be made, he said,
is that those tin-re planets have

~,magnctic liclds. The magnetic
