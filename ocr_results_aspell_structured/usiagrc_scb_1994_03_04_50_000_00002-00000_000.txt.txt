FEARLESS founder Wins humanitarian award

By Eric Olsen

ENIORNyashaSpearshasaright
to be FEARLESSt Spears is one
of ﬁve students nationwide to
receive the Howard R. Sweater Stua
dentl-lumanitarian Awardfor her work
in founding FEARLESS. The award
is given by the social service organiza-
tion Campus Compact for “outstand-
ing humanitarian achievements,"
Spears founded FEARLESS in
order to combat gender-violence and
promote highway safety. Theunsolved
murder of Tammy Zywicki in August,
1992 prompted Spears and friends to
start the group in hopes that a similar
tragedy could be prevented. “I wanted
to ﬁnd a way to channel the angry,
frustrated energy into good,” reﬂected

Spears.

LESS has been active, thanks in large
part to Spears. FEARLESS has co—
sponsoredaseriesotautorepairworks
shops in order for people to handle car
uoublesby themselves. The group has
also givennurnerousworkshopsatarea
high schools about gender-based vio-
lence and highway safety, printed and
distributed brochures, and lobbied the
Iowa state legislature to put emer-
gency call boxes on theinterstate highs
ways.

“1 see FEARLESS as continuing
to grow, and continuing with more
special projects." Spears commented.
Spears has elected to give the $1,500
award to FEARLESS in order to help
the group create a professional video
for use in presentations at area schools
and to help startFEARLESS chapters
at other colleges. Spears sees herself

as a happy avenue through which the
money can be channeled back to
FEARLESS. “ll [the money] is really
enabling l-‘EARLESS to move ahead
in the workshops," says Spears.

Spears, who has been active in
several other student organimtions
such as the Politically Active Feminist
Alliance and the Student Committee
on Sexual Harassment, will receive
her award in Chicago on Saturday,
March 26.

AccordingtoSpears,FEARLESS
is an action-based organization open
to anyone interested in preventing an-
other tragedy such as the Zywicki
murder. “It’szllmostapolitical; lmean.
no one wants highway violence, no
one wants gender-based violence.”
Spears sees FEARLESS as a chance
for everybody to come together to
work for a common good.
