Monday night, atrer a tumultuous day tor the U.S. Stock
market the Rusenfieltl Piogiairi in Public Affairs, International
Relations, and Human Rights sponsored an impromptu (lee/i
session abonr the current financial crisis and its political implie
cations,

The panelists included Bill Kelly, Jack Mutti and Bill Fer-
guson '75, all Economics, and Walt Borges, Political Science,
who together provided a short overview ot‘thc current banking
crisis before ﬁelding student questions.

points, the largest single day drop since 1987. Commentators

“VVc’ve had one [financial c
sis] every 25 to 30 years in this
country since thc revolution,"
Kelly said. “I would call this the
l-lnley's Corner of ﬁnancial cri»

According to Ferguson, many CCOHOiniC theories, Pail'llCU’
larly those of the economist Hyman Minsky, suggest that in
the current scenario a bailout plan could likely help nunntain
liquidity in the financial systemieasing investor expectations
and preventing banks from withholding loans,

Ferguson said prolonged illiquidity would have severe dera
rimental effects on business throughout the country. “There are
many businesses that survive on loans," he said. “That’s when
Wall Street hits Main Street,"

Despite the current rroubles, some aspects of the counr
try’s economy have remained strong, according to Mutti, who
pointed to the strength of the U.S. dollar a key
economic indicator of how foreigners view the
strength ofU.S. economy. .

"Since you guys have come back to school,
the US. dollar has risen 2.5 percent relative to
the Euro," Murri said “We’ve had stories about
Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, wachovia and

traditional model is that voters will
vote against the party in power or in

is bad just before the election," Borges
said. “I think it is a safe prediction to
say that Obama has the upper hand,"
But the presidential race is not the
only race up for grabs this November,
as all congressional representative seats
are up. “The ability of congress to solve the nation's problems
probably would have helped incumbents a great deal,” Borges

said. “People have a general suspicion that maybe this is being
done to do something before the election without considering
the whole range of options available.”

With the ﬁnancial crisis artecring so many different aspects
of society, it was no surprise that, according to estimates by the
SEER, well over 200 members of Grinnell’s community attends
ed.

Audience members attended for more than simply academ-
ic reasons, though. “I’ve recently started investing in the stock
market,” said Nate Hoch ’11. “So I went to the presentation
because I want to know more about what is happening to the
economy and to my money," he said.

 

Initiatives

erence’ vote as ‘in favor' to ensure sues
cess ofinitiarives," Schneider said. “We
approached it as the cup is halffull."

“We’d like to see the initiatives pass.” Schneider said "[A]
vote for ‘no preference’ shouldn’t be counted as a vote for ‘no’
since for them it doesn't matter one way or another but for
those in the [interested] group it does."

Schneider said that at this point in the process, SGA would
not consider revising the results. “I don’t think there’s an ape
propriare way to reopen it especially since STIFund has already
started work on a lot of these things," he said.
“However, that’s something I can take to STI—
Fund, and Election Board and the Cabinet to
discuss," he said. I I H

in addition to passing initiatives with low volefor no
levels of actual support, another potential prob—
lem with this interpretation is that the distortion
of apparent student support could then affect the
degree to which they are pursued by the STI-
Fund Committee or administrators.

Marissa Gilman '09,chair ofrhe STIFund Com ’ttee,said
that in the past, the committee has not prioritized in atives on
the basis of student support. Each initiative is assigned to an
individual committee member so that each initiative receives
equal and direct attention, In this way, STIFund does not have
to prioritize certain initiatives on the basis of student support.

But while STlFund tries to focus on each initiative equally,
an imbalance between the number ofinitiatives and the nums
ber of Committee membcrs could mean less work being fo»
cused on all initiatives. “1 could see that this year that could
be an issue since our committee is pretty small,” Gilman said.
“So if we wanted to do more we would need more committee
members."

That a numbcr of this semester's in arives addressed
issues of interest to a relatively narrow constituencies—like the
Cleveland television and Loose water fountains—likely con-
tributed to the high number of “no preference” votes.The Bye
laws describe the student initiative as “a means for the student
body to express its collective opinion on campus [issuchl"

CND Senator Chris Johnston ’09 said that initiatives were
still an appropriate method for student advocacy and could
help add legitimacy to student concerns when presenting them
to administrators.

“I think first of all, the idea of student
initiatives is for students to address student
concerns. whatever those concerns might be,”
Johnston said. "Because the justiﬁcation is
that when you go to the administration, one
ofthe things you can point to is ‘oh, well, look
at how many snadents approved this.’"

In order to avoid similar problems in the
future, Schneider said he hoped to bring a
resolution before Joint Board next week, ads
vocating for a revision of the Bylaws

Johnston, Schneider and others added to a general consen»
sus that the Bylaws should be revised but there are no clear ans
swers as to how (See "Alternative Initiative Counting'lright).

In addition to potentially changing the Bylaws, Cabinet
members also said that they are planning to hold a second
round of initiatives after Fall break. SGA Vice President for
Student Affairs John Burrows '10 said that a number of stu-
dents hoping to submit initiatives missed the first round and
echoed Schneider’s goal ofincteasing student participation and
introducing new ideas,

“We heard from a couple ot'students that missed the initia-
tive deadline that really wanted to get their ideas out there and
this gives them a chance to still pursue their projects withour
having to wait until the spring,"he said.

Alterna e e Count ng

This semester’s initiatives reveal a perhaps ndamental
tension in trying to achieve some level of legitimacy and
plurality among a population that often is plagued by apa—
thy and indifference. Reconciling those two will likely prove
as intractable as resolving the perennial problems ofsrudent
enggement and SGA transparency.

hé“na preference" option acts as a double-edged sword
in satisfy—
ing the two
r e (1 u i t c -
ments of
50 percent
turnout and
nun-thirds support. By not pigeonholing votes into “yes”
and “no", the “no preference" option encourages students to
vote on otherwise unpressing issues. Eliminating it could
lead to depressed turnout and problems satisfying the 50
percent level.

One alternative method would be to count “no prefer-
ence“votes toward the 50 turnout threshold but not toward
the measure of-studcnt support. But this raises questions
about the inherent contradiction in counting votes toward
one statutory requirement yet ignoring it for another.

Another option, suggested by Schneider and others,
would place each initiative on its own individual ballot
so that students would only vote for initiatives they cared
about, thereby decreasing “no preference."

But this could simply present new problems for voter
participation. It seems at best unlikely that a student body
which already struggles to meet the 50 percent quota on a
single ballot, would cast votes on numerous individual ini-
tiatives that do not concern them, while having to navigate

multiple computer screens in order to do so.
