THE GLOBETROTTERS.

Glee Club Was Well Received on [is
Trip,-~Membeis Have a Great Time
in the West.

The lowa College Glee Club return-
ed last Wednesday morning from
its thirteenth annual holiday tour.
The members looked tired, neverthe-
less in good spirits and showed no
nervous cllects from the three weeks
trip which was somewhat of a strenu-
ous nature.

The club departed on the morning
of December the seventeenth in their
private car, Elsie, over the Iowa
Central to Albia Where they transfer
ed to the Burlington road (ind pursued
that route throughout the remainder
oitlle trip. They returned Wednes-
day morning January the second,
being gone nearly seventeen days and
having traveled oval-more than two
thousand miles of railroad. The club
gave twelve regular concerts besides
two sacred concerts and appeared in
two other Sunday services, in the rol-
lowing cities in the order named:
Osceola, Iowa: Lincoln, Fair-bury,
Franklin, Nebraska: Denver, Colora»
do Springs, Colorado: Red Cloud, Neb:
Atchison, Kansas; Kansas City, Mis.
souri; and Vlillsca, Corning and
Ottumwa, Iowa. With the exceptions
of Fairbury dud Atchison, where
propor advertising had not been done.
the concerts were very well patronle
ed and the club was very warmly re-
ceived. This was especially so in the
larger places oi Lincoln, Denver, Coir
orsdo Springs, Kansas City and
ottuinwa At almost every town
strong support was given by the press.
The club was complimented especially
upon the rendition or the piaurssimo
numbers and the soloists, Mr. Lyman
and Professor Smith, received no end
or praise.

The itinerary was Carried out \viihr
out an exception which is much to
the credit of ;thc management. Sev-
erhl dilliculties arose which made
some or the conceit: look impossrble
but. the club was able to ﬁll every en-
gagement. The engagement at Don
vcr, perhaps the most important or
all,looked especially dubious when the
Burlington train which was to haul
the glee club’s car, was reported eight
hours into. but at extra expense a
Special engine was stained which took
the Club to Denver on record time
and got them in indue time for the
concert that cveningThls was perhaps
the most Sensallonul incident on the
trip and an event long to be remem
bered by all who experienced it.

The recent trip was SolneWhnL of an
experiment upon the part olgtlie club,
as neverin the history oi the college
has its glee club ever gone outside or
the state. The welcome in the \Vest
iora club from so small a school was
somewhat questioned, but ii the
enthusiastic reception with which the

Iowa College Glee club on»; met in

Tile Y. M. boys put up a fair ai‘tlcle
oi basketball and wicha little more
practice will have a good team. Their
team work was not especially good
owing to thciact that they have not
been able to play much together. The
same may be said of the college team
but it was because they tried to give
as many men as possible a tryout. '

The work of Capt. Brundage and

CONCERNING THE ALUMNI pm.

At a joint meeting oi the two upper
classes Thursday evening an attempt
was made an conciliation or cornpro-
mise in the matter or choosing what
will be a permanent senior and alumni
pin. Each class had voted for a
dillel‘ent pin at their respective class
meetings but it was hoped by a joint
meeting to come to an understanding.
There was not as large an attendance
as there should have been and the
most limb was accomplished has in
get a written expression or preicrcnce
iiom each individual. One pin,
numbered “one", o hemy gold “G”
forming alrnmc [or a small maltese
cross bearing the class numeral, was
Llieialcl'ile uith the juniors, ulnlc
number two, a malttso cross with ille
college seal upon it bearing the class
tigui-o, received senior support. The
written ballot showed lhirryone [or
number tho, nineteen for number one
and ten who voted neither,

A new doslgrrlins been submitted to
the committee but has notyet bran
acted upon. It is merely the mdllese
cross, the original college emblem,
with "Grinnell" printed across the
middle and carrying the numerals on
the lower £L|'ln. The upper arm may
also bear the letters “I. C,” 1i, is
hoped that the matter be seriously
considered by students and alumni
and that holiest expressions or
opinions, with reasons, he submitted
to the committee.
