Qﬁbtmrial

In all the universities of the caulk
try and in many or the more progres-
sive colleges, there is coming to he a
great amount at agitation looking to
ward the establishing or some sort
oi n ioafiug place or club where st i7
dents may gathcr informally at am
time. At town they are in the midst
of this movement. and are trving in
every way to get such iiii institution
to be known as the lowa Union.

It was an article in the Daily ion-an
some weeks ago, citing our own new
association building as an argument
tor the apove—ineutioned lcwa Union
which brought to us the thought or
the entirely inadequate use which we
are making ot our association build
ing. AL present it is at practically
no heneht to the student hodl’ except

as a. home [or the religious organiza-

tions. scarcely any Ilse is made of its
immense possibilities as a club room

to lie in the rooms for a hair hour and
not be interrupted, at a time when
other ioaﬁug places about town are
crowded with students.
