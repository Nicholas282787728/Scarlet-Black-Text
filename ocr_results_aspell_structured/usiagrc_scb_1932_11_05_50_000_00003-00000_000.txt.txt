Reserves,

While the Pioneers are resting this

weekend after the strenuous Drake
game of last Friday night, Creighton
Bluejays tackled the Washington
{Bears in a feature game of the Mis—
lsouri Valley conference today. The
lCreighton team will he guests of the
‘Grinnell eleven next Friday after-
,noon when the two teams tangle in
.the homecoming encounter for the
,Pioneers.
l A Creighton victory over Wash—
ington today will make the path to
'the conference championship much
‘easicr for coach Watt’s men. If the
Pioneers can win their next two
games, and Washington is beaten, the
undisputed claim to the title goes to
Grinnell.

 

Get Long Drills
Coaches Watt and Duke sent their
men through long drills this week,
climaxing the work with a regular
’practice game Thursday afternoon
between two divisions of the squad.
The game resulted in a 13—13 tie, the
yellow-jersied team, consisting most-
ly of reserves, putting up a splendid
battle against the more experienced
'white-shirted outfit. Singer did the
,‘best work for the yellow team, while
‘U'lll‘ich was the outstanding star for
the whites. »
} only a light workout was on the
|docket-for Friday, as the Grinnell
‘mentol‘s forsook heavy scrimmage.
Coach Watt is expected to drive his
Irnen hard next week, in an effort to

fhave them in the best of shape for
l‘the homecoming tilt.
Pioneers vs. Iowa State

i This afternoon 15 varsity regulars
\were to look on while the remainder
,of the squad battle the Iowa State
college B team. At the same time
,the Grinnell freshman team was to
:play its first game of the season,
,meetiug the Drake yearlings on Ward
,field. The two games were combined
gto offer a double bill for Pioneer fans.
I The B team game gave those
'memhers of the squad who had not
had much opportunity to play to
show their wares, and Coach Watt
,expected the game to be of much
lvalue as far as experience is con-
‘cerned.

The Grinnell gridders will be pro—
tecting their four~year undefeated
record on the home field when they
itackle the Bluejays next Friday.
jSlnce 1928, the Pioneers have not
.lost a game on Ward field, although
[their success away from home has
‘been mediocre. Incidentally. it was
lthe Creighton team which adminis
,tered that last 1928 defeat, snatch—
ling a heartbreaking 20-19 victory

; High football ONE OF THE BEST

By MAX noSS
In a recent syndicated sports dis~
patch the Oklahoma Aggics are list~
ed as one of the few outstanding
teams in the country. It is true that
the undefeated Cowboy eleven has
had a great season and should still
be one of the standout teams at the
close of the season.
: a- r
Further proof of their greatness is
offered by a statement of Evan (Bill)
Williams, coach of the Drake Bull-
dogs, who says that the Aggies and
the Purdue Boilermakers are the two
classiest teams that he has had the
pleasure to watch this year. And that
must include Notre Dame, because
Drake met defeat at the hands of
the Irish just three weeks ago.
r . s
Last year Walter Barham and Sid
Clarke were two of the best backs
in the Valley coufeience, but this
year we don't hear so much of them.
It isn't because their performances
have fallen off either. It‘s simply
that Ross Hall and Clarence Highfill,
their Aggie teammates, have com»
pletely overshadowed them.

team, which 'way back in 1911,
startled the football world by wins

crossing the enemy goal line. This

Down at Kansas State they are at
last heated up over the persistence
of sports writers to designate by the
nickname "Aggies" or "K-Aggies”.
official action two years ago changed

against the use of anything but that
name.

The Creighton Bluejays have a
fairly good ehhi for their recent de-
feat at the hands o[ Rice Institute
by a 41-? score. The average weight
loss per man because of the excessive
heat was eight pounds. After out-
playing their southern rivals for the
entire first half to acquire a lead, a
fumble, an intercepted pass. a block-
ed punt, and a severe penalty, each
of which led to touchdowns, com

Smith Leads
in Speedball

Crates Hall Only Contender
for Championship

Having a record of no defeats this
season, Smith hall looms as the prob-
able Champion as the 1932 speedball
schedule draws to a. close. Each of
the other five teams have been den
footed at least once, and Smith has
only two more games to play.

The game With Gates hall will be
a play off, as the Smith team tied
‘the Gates aggregation in their first
meeting. Clark, the other team yet
lto meet Smith, has won two games
.nnd lost two, putting them out of the
running for champiinnship honors.

As Gates hall has two more games
to play, it would be possible for that
building to Win the championship, by
defeating Smith and its other up-
‘ponent and thin again defeating
Smith and its other opponent and
Smith in the second play off, but if
the Smith team keeps to the form
it has shown throughout the season,
te schedule will end with Smith un-
defeated.

The standings:

Won Lost Tied Pct.
Smith a o 1.000
Gates .666

WHAT IS IT. . and how does

it improve cigarette taste?

OU’VE heard how fruit of one
variety has been crossed with
fruit of another to produce a new
and more pleasing ﬂavor. The
loganberry, for example, is a cross
between the raspberry and the
blackberry.
Chesterﬁeld’s Cross»Blend gets
the same result~betler taste—

' by a different method.

It welds together the different
kinds of several varieties of tobac-
co. Many types of Bright tobacco,
at great many types of Burley
tobacco, and numerous grades of

TASTE BETTER

Turkish tobacco are all merged
into one—Chesterﬁeld tobacco.

This welding or Cross-Blending
goes beyond ordinary blending or
mixing tobaccos together. It actu-
ally makes every kind of tobacco
in Chesterﬁeld partake of the qual-
ities of every other type.

It’s the Cross-Blending of ﬁne
Turkish and Domestic tobaccos
that gives Chesterﬁelds a distiuc'
tive, better taste. \

They are milder. They have a
ﬂavor and aroma which, we be-
lieve. you will like.
