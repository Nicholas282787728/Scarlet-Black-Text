War Not Immediate Danger Most

Americans Think

Finds Keen Student
Interest, Knowledge
of European Affairs

“War is not as much of an in‘h
mediate danger in Europe as
most Grinnell col-
lege students and
most Americans
are inclined to be»
lieve," is the opin—
ion of Dr. Waite
M. Kotschnig.

Kotschnig, who 1
has been deliver—
ing a series of leer _ ,
turns on internar liotscllnlg
tional relations, finds Grinnell
students very well informed
on the situation in Europe and
keenly interested in current dcvcl-
opmciits.

“The essential difference be-
twcen students here, however, and
students in Europe," he pointed

 

- Kotschnig

{a

cut, "is that with them, war is a
present danger, whereas here you
are 3,000 miles away from the
scene."

Thus, no matter how much in-

terest Americans may have and
how much information they ob
tain on conditions in Europe, they
can not possibly have the same
personal intcrest as the youth of
lEui‘ope who are on probable fu—
‘ture battlegrounds.

This lack of personal contact,
icoupled with the sensational
lstorles carried by part of the
‘Alllel‘iczm press, accounts for the
belief of Americans that war is
l'inniineiit, according to Kotschnig,
i “We who live in Europe,” he
‘bointed out, “have heard the cry
, 7f ‘wolf’ so often that we have be-
come somewhat innurcd to it.
whereas you, far rcmovcd froin
the scene of events, still tend to
give credence to all rumors of
hssension and strife."
