CREIGHTON MENTOR

Although Grinnell’s “thin red line"
will be outweighed almost 18 pounds
to the men in the homecoming battle
with Creighton Friday, it’s a cinch
that it won't be outfought. A power—
ful Pioneer backfield will more near-
1y approach that of the Bluejays in
weight. since both approximate 180

pounds.

There is little to choose between
the records of the two teams so im-
this year., Creighton has won three,
lost tw , and tied one, while Grimlell
has done the same thing. The Blue-
iays have scored 71 polite to their
opponents 59, “dine the Pioneers
have counted til against 41, Which is

about the same margin.

It was just four years ago almost
to the very day that Creighton upset
a strong Grionell eleven to adminis-
ter a heartbreaking 20—19 defeat, for
the last loss on Ward field that the
Pioneers have suffered since that
time. With this in mind, Captain
Graflund and his men view the game
soberly, determined to upset the
dope bucket which this time hangs
in favor of the invaders.

. a s

In that thrilling 1528 game, the
Omaha team started out with a rush
to pile up a 14-0 lead. Not to be de-
nied. however, the famous Grinnell
pas ug nttn‘ck with Russell Ruff
(who was then a sophomore) doing
the throwing carried the boil down

time for three successive touchdowns,
and a 19-14 lead. not luck was not
with them, for a fumble in Grinneli
territory gave a fighting Creighton
teamits opportunity to snatch victory
from defeat.

a s

This year’s Creighton team is just
finding itself, and after the taro tri-
umph over Washington, which team
heat the Pioneers 14-7, it bids fair to
continue on its merry march. But
the Pioneers have no particular love
for the Creighton team, with an 84)
defeat last year still fresh in their
minds, nd so there is no need for
pessi. m in the Grinnell camp.

Sammy Singer Sprints 75
Yards for Only Score

By intercepting a pass and running
75 yards for a touchdown, diminutive
Sammy Singer gave the Grinnell “B"
eleven a do victory in the fourth
quarter, over the Iowa State college
second team, in a game played here
Saturday afternoon,

Although the Pioneer seconds bad
a considerable edge over their op-
ponents during most of the game,
they were unable to push the ball
over the goal until the last period.
Both teams managed to reach their
opponents 2 yard line, but on both
occasions the respective lines hristled
and four downs were wasted,

On numerous occasions the local
backfield men hroke through for long
gains and seemed to be especially
successful at charging through the
AmeS line. one of the features of the
tilt was the efficient tackling on the
part of Singer. Henningson's punts
averaged nearly 40 yards.
