FORGOT YOUR. PARACHuTE./././

This week we can lean back and light a cigarette, be-
cause the most talked-about topic is absolutely non-contro-
versial. The Board of Publications will be forced to agree
with us. No one, not even Senator McCarthy, can find
subversive elements in it. In fact, it‘s fool-proof!

The evidence is conclusive. Exhibit A: girls are wear-
ing cotton skirts. Exhibit B: tennis rockets and golf clubs
have been flaunted openly. Exhibit C: blankets are back.
In the face of all this, how can the S&B help but take a,
definite stand? We say, and you may quote us, SPRING
IS HERE!

To the editor:

The Stevens are on their way home. Tomorrow we leave for
Germany. There we go 'to HollandAto England and then best of
all we board the Queen Elizabeth for home.

Our trip has been exciting and satisfying so far. Outside of a
minor project which I have carried on for one of the branches of
the government, we have devoted ourselves to seeing, eating,
sleeping, and visiting. Grinnellians have been everywhere we have
gone. It has been fun wondering how long it would be, when first
we arrive in a new city, before we shall have run into someone
we know. As Bob Hope said. “We really never have left home."

1 Here are some superficial quick impressions about people and
p aces.

France is an interesting, sometimes a beautiful country. Paris
is still one of the great cities of the world. However one some-
times feels that her elegance is on the shady side of splendor.

The French people with whom we have come in contact (ed-
ucators, government officials, labor leaders, white collar workers)
appear to be very sclf»centereol, slightly paranoid and very defen-
sive about current conditions in France. The bus drivers are manir
hes, the waiters are greedy and grasping.

Italy is really beautiful country. The land is intensively cul-
tivated. The cities are old, proud and unsanitary. Its past seems
to have been sufficient. Mussolini still appears to most Italians we
talked to, as a rennaissance of light too soon extinguished but
historically derived from Imperial sources.

One famous Italian poetess said to me, “Rome was, and the
known world moved at her bidding. Rome will be. and the world
will bow down and worship her." This appeared to me to be the
most extensive bit of wishful thinking I had heard in a long time.

The Italian people are kind, Warm and friendly, Some of them,
that is to say. Others are thieves of the worst sort. This might
also be said of Americans.

In both France and Italy everything is terribly expensive.
Home has a sense of imperial dignity still. We loved her, seven
hills and faint odor of past glory.

Switzerland is majestic. The people are secure, detached,
friendly in a distant sort of way. They appear to feel slightly su-
perior. Perhaps they are. At least they were smart enough to stay
out of two wars.

There are more worthwhile things to buy, at prices which are
realistic, in Switzerland than in either France or Italy.

So for so cod. ‘

In spite 0 all the distractions of travel, our hearts are far
from here. We talk about the college most of the time and we look
forward ‘th ho eful anticipation to the time when we shall again
be back in the rinneu community, _

Spring has come to Iowa, I am sure, and with it a new sense
of life for everyone at the college. We hope that things have been
going smoothly.

Warm good wishes,
The Stevens

To the editor:

 

The choir returned Tuesday from a very successful
tour of towns in Iowa, Many of the members, however, ex-
pressed disappointment at the sparse attendance at their
evening concerts. They seemed particularly upset because
there were only about 40 people at the Des Moines concert.

Upon investigation we find that invitations were sent

to approximately 700 people in Des Moines including Trus—
tees, Alumni, and parents. Of this number only 20 purchased
tickets ahead of time, although a few more did show up for
the concert.
We feel that the choir is justifiably upset and we can’t
help wondering whether the tickets weren't too expensive
($1.25). If such a situation in Des Moines continues to ex-
ist, we can’t help feeling that 600 Alumni are letting us
down rather badly.

Bravo

. We certainly hope that the persons rWl‘lO have been
raising questions about the concert series this year went to
hear Messrs. Gold and F‘izdale last Wednesday. They should
have enjoyed the duo-pianists, as we did.

Opinions and tastes vary, of course, and it is likely

that some students will disagree with our praise of Wed-
nesday’s concert, but we aren’t going to listen long to the
griping of someone who didn’t go. '

Knocks’ in last week’s 5&3 with
regards to the changing of the
car rule. The fact that l disae‘
gree with your opinion is ir-‘
relevant, but my disagreement
with your attitude concerning
the whole matter is extremely‘
pertinent. Because the editorial
board felt that cars should be.
vei-sial issue. and one that vit-,
iors only, they conveniently
neglected lo print any one of
a number of good editorialsl
presenting the other side of the
issue. i have talked with the
authors of these rejected ediri
torials, There was not one word
printed in favor of the unlimitv
ed car rule, or anything said
that might lead the students
to regard that alternative in any/7
thing but an unfavorable light.
The board certainly has the
right to express its own opin-
ions, but has no right to squelch
opinions contradicting their own.
The primary policy of any col-
lege newspaper should be to
print the truth, and to present
all sides of a problem. it is my
opinion that you have neglected
to do this on a highly controc
allotted to second semester sen-
ally affects every student on this
campus. 1 think the board has
fallen down sadly in this mat-
ter, and has violated the trust
placed in them by the student
body.

To the editor:

in answer to the editorial of
last week, in which you stated
that the'rcasons for the disconr
linuance of the coffee hour were
not clear: The reasons would
have been quite clear had you
taken the trouble to ask any of
the Friars. First, realizing the
difficulty of getting people i117
doors on warm spring after-
noons, we originally planned to
continue them only until after
spring vacation. Moreover, they
did not develop into what we
had hoped for. We had hoped
to stimulate an active relation
ship between faculty and stu-
dents m which they could meet
iniormally and ﬁnd mutual in-
terests We were disappointed,
however; in that the activity
was not well»attended and the
discussions were often far from
inspiring; too often they degen-
erated into mere repetition of
“the same old gripes,"

board has failed to grasp what
the situation involves. Perhaps
it would be better if, your policy

I’ve been trying to think of
something to say about cars
and Car rules. It hasn't been
easy because I haven't always
felt the Was] I do now.

by Bruce Cole

l When I arrived at Grinnell
several falls ago I drove in and
asked my counselor if he could
help me to locate a garage. He
said he Couldn't but thatithe
dean of men was the man to
see. That waswhen I took the
car—rule Seriously for the first
time. I'd noticed it in the rule-
book which had been sent to
me but thought it was one of
those archaic statutes like spits
ting on the sidewalk or kissing
on Sunday.

The dean of men brought me
up to date with dispatch ~— more
than I was able to appreciate.
as I recall. I was really shocked
when I was told I’d be expelled
if caught using my 'own auto»
mobile without receiving per»
mission. My car had become as
much a part of my life as my
razor and my wristwatch. I
didn‘t learn to do without it in
a few weeks. either.

I found that storing a car was
expensive and that it didn‘t do
the aging relic much good to
sit in idleness . , . I could see
my life’s savings vanishing. I
sold the beloved Blue Beetle
the following summer and since
then have sort of come to ac»
cept my fate. I’ve gotten to
the point now where i wish that
id never have to own a car
lagain. Getting rid of my car was
like having my blackmailer drop
dead.

When the guy came around,
and asked me to Sign one of
the petitions I was all for keep-
ing the car-rule just as it is.
it never has been impossible
to keep a car here; anyone with
a decent excuse can get per-
mission. I’d hate to have to de-
cide which excuses are decent;
but decency is the business of
deans and they've shown them-

. selves to be reasonably solvent.

I‘m aware, though, that a lot
of Grinnell gentlemen want cars
for one reason or another, and
that a handful of others want
ithe privilege of saying whether
they should have them. When
i think of my feelings a few
years ago, I can't take it upon
myself to state dogmatically
that the car—rule is for the best.
I think that it is. at least from
the standpoint of discipline and
economy, and I’ve already tried
to Justify that.

i can only hope that if the
car—rule is abolished or amend»
ed it won't make Grinnell into
another Drake or Coe. What-
ever the outcome, we’ll have our
selves to answer to and that
will be a pleasant change.
