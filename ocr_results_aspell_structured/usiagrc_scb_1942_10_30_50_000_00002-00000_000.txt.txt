Why Break Our Necks?--—

Every man in college knows that he has a
fair chance of having his neck broken some-
time in the future. Why hasten the chances
while he is still in Grinnell‘.7 True, no cases
of broken necks have been reported. but
there have been sprained ankles, buised
legs, etc. resulting from tlle crude cinder
paths that adorn the campus. Cinder walks
are nice when they have cinders on them.
But our paths are overgrown with clinkers
and boulders. Greatest offender is the
Rocky Road to the Quad running parallel
to the highway.

There is a perfectly good cinder—making
machine in back of the heating plant. The
hub-bub caused by our “invasion" has died
down. There is no reason why' we can not
have walkable paths before snow covers
the boulders making it impossible to dodge
the obstacles. The men feel that the con—

ditioning obstacle course gives them the
proper training along- those lines. The girls
don’t want any. Before there are too many
unnecessary cripples \l'alking around the
campus, let’s put cinders‘ on the paths and
contribute the boulders to defense.

The Excep+ion lo lhe Rule---

Grinnell is a llonderful institution. Any
student \l'lll tell you that. Grinnell has its
rules and regulations, and all the students
are ,Very careful to follow them, even if at
times they seem rather peculiar.

Take, for example, the problem of proba-
tion Students must refrain from taking part
in any outside activity. All their time must
be Spent in study until the period of proba-
tion is over.

Grinnell’s book of rules and regulations
goes into even further detaili To quote, “A
student who is placed on probation for any
reason by a faculty or administrative coun-
cil, if a freshman, shall not spend more time
in athletic practice than in physical educa-
tion for which the freshman athletics is
substituted." ‘

Now consider our freshman football team.
Last Friday the freshman squad was to have
played Cornell’s freshmen. It was called
off because too many of the players had
been placed on probation. And yet, dun‘ng
the past week, these same players have
been reporting for practice regularly.

If the rules on probation are to stand,
the time which the freshmen are using for
practice should instead be used for study.
But if the rules are going to be ignored,
why bother to call off the game at all‘.7
Two hours, more or less, will not help or
hinder a grade point average.

Why not allow the freshman squad to
continue its games? Let them schedule
another game with Cornell, The increase
in freshman enthusiasm and class spirit
would more than make up for the breaking
of a ruler

Army Welcomes Spectators For
Weekly Reviews On Saturdays

The army unit's program of "re-
stricted areas" has worked almost
too well as far as McEachron
field on Saturday mornings is
concerned.

In two Saturday morning reV
views of Company A, only a
handful of braver students and
faculty members have braved the
restricted area policy and causes

quelit “college and army discip~
line" to watch the formations.

‘We aren't removing the re-
stricted area boundaries, “Capt.
G. w. Ball said chiiesdny, “but
there’s a lot of roam around Mc-
Eachron field that is open to the
public and the ai-my unit would
really welcome any spectators for
the Weekly review."

The entire field is visible from
the top row of stadium seats, as
well as from the roadway adjac-
ant to the field itself.

The Grinnell high school band
is providing music for the he.
views, Boll said.

The company inspection begins
at 10:45 a. m. on Saturday, Ball
said, and the marching formations
follow immediately.
