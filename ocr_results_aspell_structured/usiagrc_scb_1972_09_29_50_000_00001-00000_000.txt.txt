Governor Ray greets students and townspeople, celebrating the opening

of the local Republican Headquarters.

Governor Roy Passes Through

A crowd Of about 150 was on hand
Monday aﬁernoon as Governor
Robert D. Ray cut the tape at the
Republican headquarters at Fifth
and Broad, to launch the Republir
can campaign for Poweshiek and
several neighboring counties. Ray,
who earlier in the day had affirmed
his own candidacy lor reelection,
told the Republicansand ouier in-
terested onlookers that the guber—
natorial campaign would be one or
“promise vs. performance."

Ray was not supposed to deliver a
iormal speech but beiore he cut the
tape he told the Crowd of 75 who
gathered inside the headquarters
that ”we are in a very enviable
position,”

Ray rated an end to the dralt as
more pressing than the question of
amnesty, and on the war he told the
sale that, although he did not want
to go into detail, it was apparent
to himthatPresidentNixon had made
progress in reducing the number or
troops from 549,000 to the present
level of 30.000.

Governor Raypointed out, however,
that being Governor of Iowa was a
full-time job and at various times
during his visit he commented on
drug abuse, gambling legislation,
revenue sharing, and taxes. Rav
noted that last year loWa had “the
lowest per capita tax increase of
any state in the nation outside of
one.”

NUMBER 6

College Pub Referendum Passes

by John Wylie

students voted overwhelmingly in

Tuesday's opinion poll in favor of
having a pub cntheGi-inncllcampus.
The iinal tally was 497 students
(54%) in favor, 2oz (36%) opposed,
and l abstaining.

Despite elaborate eilorts to insure
a large student turnout, only 62%
of Grinnell’s 1264 students partici—
pated in theopinion surveyThesun
vey was not binding; rather it was
engineered by the Student Services
Committee to measure student senr
timent about the proposed facility.

Survey Coming

According to Business Manager
Ralph Pomerenk, the poll showed
that there was not heavy opposition
to the establishment of a campus
pub...and little else.

at a Wednesday meeting oi the
Student Services Committee, it was
decided to refer the matter back to
the Facilities and Food Service Sub
Committee for further consid-
eration.

Pomerenk told theSdzB thatJames
Hamilton, a member of the Com-
mittee, was preparing a more exr
tensive questionnaire on the order
of a market research survey, which
would be administered to a selected
group of students. This Would give
the Committee some basis forplan-
ning the exact facilities to be instal-
led at the pub.

Schwengei Discusses Issues

by John Wylie and Terry Wolf

Republican Congressman Fred
Schwengel, appeared beloreabout 75
people at a PPPE lecture Friday
for a question/answer session, iol-
lowed by a dinner with ten Grin-
nellians. The iowa Representative
came out poorly in the lecture but
well during the dinner.

Representative Schwengel is in the
midst of a close contest with the
Democratic candidate for the lirst
district seat, Ed Mesvinsky.

Schwengel mentioned his opponent
by name only once during his Grin—
nell visit, charging that, "Mezvlnsky
was not author of one bill or one
ammendment that was passed and
signed into law" (during his term
in the lowa legislature).

John Kent, Mezvinsky's Campaign
Coordinator, admitted inatelephohe
interview with the sold that the
charge was true in atechnical sense,
but labeled it a “smokescreen”.
He said that, while Mezvinsky’s
name does not appear on any laws
passed during his tenure in the Iowa
House from 1968-1970, many changes
for whch the Representative had
worked vigorously have since come
to pass.

Schwengel allirmed his support tor
the reelection of President Nxon,
sighting as pluses the chiel execu-
tive’s stands on revenue sharing,
weliare relorm, “pollution so-

lution”, improved relations with
Russia and China, mass transit, and
home rule for the District of Col—
umbia.

Commenting on the Nxon ioreign
policy, he noted, “I think his will-
ingness to change his position on
communism and go to China and go
to Russia and say that we're going
to start doing business with you is
a great plus."

While landing Nixon’s ﬂexibility
in foreign affairs, Schwengel cited
McGovern’s inconsistencies as that
candidate’s primary minus. “The
biggest minus that i see in George
McGovern is that he just wobbles
all over the place. lie has no lirm
position, he's not consistent.”

Schwengel criticized McGovern’s
judgement in the Eagle-ton Case, and
noted, “He just doesn’t have the
ability to surround himself with cap»
able people to do the job that has
to be done.”

The Congressman appeared more
defensive than he had been during
his appearance at Grinnell last
spring. Members of the audience
seemed to be rankled by Schwengel's
use of Phrases such as “Chavez's
outfit” and “Schlesinger and those
other farrouters”, He also implied
that he thought that many of the
questions had beenengiheeredbyhis
opponent’s supporters.

Schwengel’s seemingly delensive

-WATER WOES -

First the power . .

now the water . . .

what next???

Grinnellians may have noticed decreased or nonrexistent water

pressure during the past week.

The problem was city wide,

according to spokesmen for the Grinnell City Water Works.
Water Department workers discovered Thursday that pumping
equipment at the «7 well, which provides the bulk oicriunelrs

water, had broken down.

Water was immediately brought in

from the #5 and IIB wells, hut itwas insufficient to meet the city's

demand.

pressure began dropping to near zero levels Tuesday when the

300,000

gallon water tower ran dry.

Some water was being

pumped directly lrom the reservoir, but this was insutiicient

to meet the city’s needs.

Full water service was restored to Grinnell Thursday.

posture may be explained by. the
attempts 0le few individuals to ask
overly, specific, embarrassing
questions, an extremely heavy schr
edule and the proximity oi the up
coming general election.

Predictably, Schwengel was asked
his views on the liberalization of
marijuana and abortion laws.

“0n abortion...l agree completely
with the Republican platform fertile
State Of Iowa—-that’s apretty liberal
platformﬁwhich says that it should
be decided by the mother and the
doctor.”

On marijuana legislation, he com-
mented, “We need to sometime to
give consideration to some iorm oi
legalization ol marijuana, it tor no
other reason but to control it."

At the dinner following the interr
view, Schwengel discussed several
issues in greater detail,

Schwengel asserted his belief that
Maurice Stans and other high-level
officials were not involved in the
Water-gale ariair if [or no other
reason than the stupidity of the at-
tempted bugging.

At one point during the discussion,
a student hinted at a possible com-
parison between the recent acts of
Generals Lavelle, Westmoreland,
and others and the case oiJopanese
General Yamashita, who was exer
cuted ior war crimes iollowing
World War 11. After some con,
sideration and with a note oi pain»
lul resignation, Schwengel agreed
with a suggestion that war crimes
trials illight be in order for some
Ameiicnn generals

Cost projections areanothermajor
problem in planning the pub. Poms
erenk's “very rough, off the top ol
my head estimate" is that it will
cost $lo,ooo to $20,000 to set up
the kind oi pub currently being dis
cussed. This would include air cons
ditioning and air circulating equips
ment, sound prooling, andconstl‘uce
lion ofa bar.

Pomerenk commentedthat,assnm.

a proposal would he readied tor the
Trustees metting in early No-
vember, it would be as specific as
possible at that time, he told us,
but “we certainly wont be able to

There has been no specific discus

sion about the iinancing of the pub.
Pomerellk said that Committee
members uete assuming that the
College would loan working capital
to the pub, which will be expected
to pay the money back.

Private Club
According to the current projece
tions, the pub will be organized
as a private club, with its own
otiicei-s and staii. independent olany
existing College organization This
organization would be responsible
for repaying the College lrom its
revenues

The Facilities and Food Service
Sub Committee will study the pub
further, and submit a report to the
entire Student Services Committee
