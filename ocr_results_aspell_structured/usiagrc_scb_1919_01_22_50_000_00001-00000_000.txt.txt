Matlack Explains Principle of
Three Colleges as Applied
to Dormitories.

SELF GOVERNMENT PART
OF THE GRINNELL SPIRIT

Judgment of Upperclassmen Is
Dependable — Are Actuated
by Loyal Spirit,

That the development of a men's lilo
for men is the normal aim of all con-
neeted With the men’s dormitories was
the opinion expressed by Dean of Men
H. IV. Matlack in an interview last
night. .

The principle of a men's college for
men, and a women's college for Women
was Set forth by him as follows:
“Gl'innell has made a splendid begin
ning toward the establishing of a Col-
lege which gives to Women the dis—
tinctive advantages of a Women's col—
lege and to men the distinctive advan-
tages of a men's college, coupled with
the advantages to he gained from a
coeducational institution.

“The natural center of the men’s life
is the men's quadrangle. Although i -
complete, this quadrangle already is
becoming the normal center of the
Grinnell man's life, and with the addie
Gun of the men’s union, for whiCh We
all earnestly hope, the men of Grin-
nell will come into their own, With all
the privileges and opportunities for
stndy and fellowship that any College
can afford.

“" Patience 1s Necessary.

”The immediate problem," he said,
“is to recognize that the standards of
life in the men's quadrangle are in a
slow process of formation. “any
problems have to be met and solved.
Patience, forbearance and good nature
must be exercised by even'one, If

‘mis is done, Wholesome, strong and
lasting standards of living and charac-
ter will be developed among us.”

Dean ‘Matlack further expressed
himself as being conﬁdent that the
men could and should govern them
'selves,

To Iinvc Self Government.

”Self Government for the student
body," he stated, “is one of the dis
tinguishing featureseof the Gl'innell
Spirit,

“I believe that the judgment of men
of the type of the Grinnell uppers
classmen is dependable. I am conﬁ—
dent that our men are actuated by a
real spirit of loyalty to principles of
the college and good citizenship, and
that they are capable of ultimately
establishing a standard of life for men
here which will be normal, and con-
ducive to high standards of scholar-
ship and public service.

“The natural expression of govern—
ment for men is through the house
chairmen and house committees. The
chief problem before us is to cultivate
a sense oi responsibility for the welv
fare, not only of the men, but also of
the college as a‘ whole, and to co-
operate to the fullest extent With all
the forces which have the best inter
ests of Grinnell at heart."

Soldiers Find New
Conception of Home

Prof. H. F. Evens, recently 3', M.
C. A. worker in France, said that the
experiences of the American soldiers
in France have given them a new con-
ception of home and religion, in his
vcsyer address last Sunday,

“Home consciousness was very
strong over there," he said, "and it
grew as the months went by, Careless
lads over here have been learning over
there the joys 'and blessings of home,
the love of home, and all for which
it stands."

A tribute to the work Prof. Clara
E, Millard who has been doing in
France was given to Prof. Evans by
one of his co—workers, who said that,
because of the pioneer work which she
did in nursing, it was commanded by
the general that the "Y” should have
women in the nursing stations.

”Jazz 'em up, razz ‘em up, start the

which a charming chorus brought cab-
aret life into Grinnell.

On last Saturday night the Cottage
Five Cabaret opened the season by
introducing Flve's Foolish Follies, The
Two Nuts and Eva Sanguay with her
chorus, The cabaret is located on the
roof garden of Cottage Five's sub-

but as a rule business and domestic
affairs were forgotten in enjoying cab—
aret life to' its fullest extent. Eva
Sanguay’s song, “Treat Me Rough
which was composed by the popular
song writer, Foul Stewart, proved to
be the biggest hit of the evening,

If a, fighting spirit will win the

opponents and will be able to show
more against the westcincrs than they

Men Are Improving.

Hard and strenuous workouts each

varsity practice started two weeks

ability and look better each day. Every
man has bad a chance to show what he

Fresh Don Nighties
And Take Toll of
Entertainment

“All Freshmen men out! Put your
pajamas and nightics on." Tbc two
strange commands startled the men of
the men's dormitories into life non-
day evening as racing ﬁgurcs in white
rushed howling down the stairs and
along the cloistcr. It was the annual
freshman “sllirtvtail parade" and the
class was out with many strange look—
ing I'lniforlrls flapping in the wind.

”One- iile-tll'e-two. Onernine-two-
two.” With a regular but tar from
monotonous cadence the crowd startr
ed for town and “treats" at the ex,
pcnsc of the tradesmen. They Visited
the Strand and informed the manage-
llnout that they wished to scc a show.
They did. Also‘ at the Lyric, where,
however, they spent more time yelling
than watching the film,

The Grinnell Sweet. Shop was an»
nounccd to be there with the ﬁght at
ter the noi y ghosts were treated to
candy ban. They then raided Candy-
ldud, where they were ﬁlled with more
candy! They had pie at the Mct and
pcid a visit to Hopkins, and then have
mg completed their shopping tour they
headed for the Quad and marched
down the loggia-serenadlng each cote
[age with raucous yells as they passed.
It was a wild night and the men re-
turned to the dormitories tired but
hcppy, with not a trace lcft of voices
or hungry fcclings.

“Treat me rough, boys, treat me
rough,”7e\’en though she is a “pi-u-
deut miss" like the girl in the song,
this is what she sings all the time now.
Tile song is the last one written by
Paul Stewart before he left Grinncll.
It was written for "Miss Eva Sang?
way” and her chorus at the Cabaret
given Saturday night by Cottage Five,
The girls say it’s the kind that sticks
by you, and no matter where you go
in the Quad, you’ll hear someone sing-
ing, humming, or whistling ”Treat Me
Rough.“

Contributed.

With the appointment of President
J. H. T, Main to a position on the gov»
crnnicut board to investigate the prob—
lcms of relief for Armenia and Syria
it was thought that Grinnell could show
no greater appreciation of the honor
confcrrcd than by turning over this
sum to him to be applied as he might
desire.

This choice is especially ﬁtting be-
cause of the work mat the Rev, George
White and other Gl'innell people have
been doing at Marsovan, Turkey. Dr.
White has been vice-president of the
American college maintained there for
many years.

President in London.

President iloin is now in London,
where the party is awaiting passports
from the British government before
going to the interior parts of Armenia
and Syria,

Grinnell has aided in many other
ways in ra. ing the $121,000 quota for
lows. Several of the faculty alld stu-
dents spent all or part of their vaca-
[Ions in promoting the drivc in various
Darts of the state.

Mason Ladd, working in southeast»
ern sccu'on of Iowa, has instrumental
in persuading many commumucs to
pledge their full quota and. more.

RADIO STATION
AGAIN CLOSED

Rte-Assembled Plant Denied Right“
to Operate.

The college wireless station, which
was opened and set up by the class
in radio communication, must be closed
and not used until notice is received
from the office of the Secretary of
Commerce that amateur experimental
stations may be reopened, according to
a letter received last week by the
physics department from that office,
The letter was received in answer to
a letter sent requesting permission to
opeil the station for experimental
work.

At the beginning of the \var all
amateur stations were closed by the
government and the commercial sta-
tions were operated by the ncvy. The
Grlnnell station which was used
mainly for experimental purposes and
for receiving the correct time from
the government'observatory at Arling-
ton, Va, was dismantled at this time
and the apparatus lent to the 339th
artillery regiment at Camp Dodge.
which is the regiment to which
Lieutenant Willard Ray is attached.
When this regiment went to France
last summer the instruments were re-
turned to the college and the set was
assembled by the radio class, which
has now been discontinued.
