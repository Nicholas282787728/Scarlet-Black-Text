Male student approaches Grinnell police
April 30 attack may not be related to Midwest serial rapes

BY JILL ERICKSON
News Editor

An unidentified male student at Grin-
nell College “came forward to acknowlr
edge that he was the person being sought
by authorities" in the alleged sexual as»
sault of a 19-year—old female in her dorm
room April 30, according to an article
May 8 in the Grinnell Herald»Register.
Grinnell police Sgt. Randy Hanssen

Thursday afternoon conﬁrmed the con ,

tents of the May 8 article, but Hanssen
would provide no additional information
about the ease.

”The information that we have pro-
vided is all the information that we will
provide at this time,” Hanssen said. No
arrests have been made, and Grinnell po-
lice are continuing to investigate. Unless
charges are ﬁled, police will not identify
a suspect.

Progress made thus far in the investi-
gation “suggests the April 30th incident
may not be related to the possibility [that]
the attacker [is] the serial rapist" respon»
sible for assaults on several rural Midwest
campuses during February and March,
according to a Grinnell Police Department
press release dated May 2. The press re-
lease was reprinted in part and made avail-
able to students via the college’s vax sys»
tern.
A ﬂyer posted Thursday midday by
students on campus stated that a Grinnell
student had “confessed to involvement"
in the incident. Nicole Cable ‘97, Dan
Buettner ‘97, and Dave Newville ‘99 said
they posted the flyer because they felt the
administration had failed to provide stu-
dents with basic updates on the investi—
gation after May 2.

”We were also attempting to speak to
the larger issue that students and the ad-
ministration fail to adequately address is~
sues surrounding interpersonal violence
on this campus," Cable said, Cable and
Buettner distributed an email with simir
lar contents to at least 149 students and
campus organizations. The contents of the

End-of-year recycling

BY LINDSAY HAGY
Staff Writer

After classes are over and ﬁnals are fun
ishcd, the nextchallenge for Grinnell students
wilbepacking up to leave. In order to cut back
on waste and to share with those who are less
fortunate, the Community Service Center and
Facilities Management haveteameduptourge
students to dispose properly of unwanted be»
longings.

According to Community Service Center
staff members, unwanted belongings that
could be useful to others can be placed in yel»
low bags and then packed in large boxes lar
beled “Second Mile." Both bags and boxes
are available in ﬁrst-ﬂoor dorm lounges. The
boxes can be brought to 1127 Park St. or to
the farthest north bay at the machine shed
across _ﬂ'om therugby ﬁeld. Students also may
call the Community Service Cenm at 2.69-
4247 to have their donations picked up. All
donated items will be distributed to local
homeless and domestic violence shelters,
churches, and families in need.

Useful items include clothing, unopened
packaged food, laundry detergent. shampoo.
conditioner, lotions, hair spray and personal
items, small appliances, shelving. plastic
wastebaskes, books. text books and oﬂice
supplies. large items such as mgs and fumi-
ture should be placed at the curbs. Students
also should put cash refundable recyclable
items in Carl Carts before leaving campus.
Non-refundable recyclables can be brought to

recycling bins under Gates Tower and be
tween James and Haines halls.

Items leﬁ in rooms or hallways will be
thrown outby Facilities Management. Facilir
ties Management is not allowed to make the
decision to keep valuable articles. so students
tnust put items in the proper places or the
objecB Will end up in landﬁlls.

CSC coordinator Amy Ellen praised Fa»
cilities Management for their help on this
project.

“This isa very busy time for them," Etlctt
said. “They have been very helpful. It's just
as easy for theln to throw it all away, but they
don’t [if items are put in proper areas]. This
indicates extra effort on their part.“

‘ Facilities Management also has helped the
CSC by donating old dorm furniture when
dorms are renovated, Ellen said. The CSC’S
studentassistant, JR. Osborn ‘97, said: “Our

hopes are to have people know about this so
that if there is somed'ting needed by some

one, instead of it being thrown away, it will
be brought to the collecting sites. We would
also like to raise the awareness on part of the
campus commumty that so much goes to
waste."

Osborn and Emily Andrews ‘97 will stay
in Grinnell into the Summer to help the CSC
and community members sort through what
is collectedAny students who will be in Grin-
nell are strongly encouraged to help with the
prOJBCK. Questions can be directed to Amy

to its May 8 publication. Crady also em—
phasized thatcollegc ofﬁcials have touched
base with police almost on n daily basis,
including during a meeting with police and
Btecmcr late Wednesday afternoon.

“The police did not share that infor»
mation with us,” Crady said. “I can't say

anything about that. I don't know how
[the Herald-Register] got the informa-
tion."

Both Hanssen and Crady voiced an-
ger that the term “confessed" was used
in the ﬂyet and e~mail. The term was not
used in Breemer’s article.

“We feel that it’s irresponsible." Clady
said. “We're looking into the situation
right now."

“Nobody can say whether he's guilty
or not. Nobody can even say there‘s a
crime yet," I-Ianssen said.

Newville emphasized that he, Cable
and Buettner were not asking for details
to be released about the victim or the al-
leged assailant.

“This is a public safety concern,”
Buettner said. "This is about why stu-
dents are not being given information that
is directly relevant to their personal
safety.“

Buettner, Cable and Newville main-
tained that semantics were not at issue.

“WhetherI said admitted or acknowl-
edged or confessed, I don‘t see that it
makes much difference, because con-
fessed is essentially correct,” Buettner
stated, “and the larger issue is why were
we not given this basic information by

. Student Affairs."

Following the disbursement of the ﬂy-
ers, a reprint of the Herald—Register‘s ar-
ticle was made available to the campus
community in the late afternoon Thurs-
day on the vax system. Crady empha-
sized that the college would not provide
any additional information without the
consent of the police department.

“We’re not in any position to jeopar-
dize the investigation," he stated. Other
ofﬁcials including President Pamela
Ferguson declined comment.
