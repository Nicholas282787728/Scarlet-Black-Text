Sarah Patkcr’07 has been playing marimba
ever since hei middle school physics teacher
commissioned the wood shop instructor to
craft a set of the African Xylophone-like ‘in-
struincnt. Parker and her parents soon joined
an adult marimba course in her hometown of
Portland, Oregone, Now, weeks after being aCe
eepted to Harvard graduate school for Chemr
istry, Parker won the competitive Watson Fel—
lowship and will spend the next year traveling
around Africa to study marimba culture.
Although Parker heard aboutWats'on Fel-
lowships when she was still a child (she first
remembers her dad explaining them as “an
opportunity to research the use of ﬁmo clay
around the wor'ld for a year" when she was 10)
she had not originally been interested in ap»
plying for one, Parker says what prompted her
successful proposal was the application process

Grinnellian chemistry star Sarah Parker ’07 snags
a competitive Watson scholarship which will take
I around Africa for a year to study marimba culture

itself, which forced her to consider what she
would do for a year irshe could do absolutely
anything. She remembered attending a nerfor-

Thisluly, Parker will travel to South Afrir

ca, Botswana and Namibia, She is not allowed ‘

to return to the United States for one year or

inance at Grinnell by a well-known PrestlgiOusstay in an area in where she's previ-

mariraba player rrom Africa. Parker
began to think about the possibilir
ties orliving with and learning from
someone like him for a year.

Then, when Parker told her adviser
that she didn’t believe she had enough
time to complete the extensive Watson
application, her adviser adamantly encoun
aged her to submit:

Out of 16 initial individuals, Grinnell
chose Parker and four others to compete
for the national award. In the final pro-
cess, Parker interviewed wrth former Watson
scholars. Finally, in Mareh,she heard the good
news and posted an ecstatic entry on her Plan.
“I got the Watsonl!" she wrote, “And now I
have no idea what to do!!! In a great way!!"

Pioneers

ously spent time. “The Fellowship

is supposed to push you out of your

comfort zone, and they are very good
at that," she said.

Parker hopes to find African hosts

at a wide range of institutions. Right now,

she has heard baek primarily from upper-

class boarding schools, as they have more

access to global communication than do

the more rural schools or organizations,

In every country, she will he researching

the effect of the marimba on youth culture.

While manmbas are originally from west

Africa, they were introduced to South Africa

during the 19605 as an instrument to reach

children traditional music Without being bit

ascd towards any speciﬁc ethnic or regional

group.

Musicians shaped the instrument to incor-
porate musical traditions from various areas
and cuimres, both in its physical appearance
and the method or playing. They transposed
traditional music onto the marimba, with a lot
of inﬂuence from the mhira, an instrument
Westerners often refer to as a “thumb piano” (a
label, Parker adds, that does not do itjustice).

The list of instruments Parker plays is eye-
brow-raisingly lengthy: piano, tlutc, oboe, sat-
ophone and harp. But the marimba, she says,
is unique, "Marimba is a highly interactive
instrument," she said. Marimbas are played in
groups without a director and there is no sheet
music. Since these aspects make malimba not
very conuc‘ive to course work and so much of
her time is dedicated to her other musical in-
terests;tnarimha has always been Parker's "just
for fun” instrument.

Parker also pointed out that although
marimba lacks the type of formality seen in
much or the music practice and performance
familiar to Western culture, , it can be easily
played by a "nonemusician." Marimbas have
the beneﬁt of allowmg an independent, mus
sically-inclined woman like Parker to further
challenge herself.
