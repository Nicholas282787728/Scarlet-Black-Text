Emmanuel ’5 Gift

team (2005)

Inspirational true story,
narrated by Oprah

A gift indeed. Every once in a while
we hear the story of a petson overcom-
ing insurmountable odds to triumph in
the face of unimaginable adversity (sec
2003's Trutbing 1hr Void). And while
many such stories inspire awe and ad—
mitalion, few actually get us thinking
“maybe I could do that." Emmanmli
Gift, narrated by Oprah Winfrey, manr
ages to be one of those few, because it
isn’t about the superhuman—it's about
what a regular person can do to help
those around him.

The documentary starts in Ems
manuel Ofosu Yeboah’s home in Ghana,
where roughly ten percent of the popu»
lationisomc two million pcoplwarc
disabled Most, because ofintense disr
ctimination, are reduced to begging for
alms. Some shine shoes for a dollar a
day, including Emmanuel, who was
born with a deformed leg. Because of
the burden the disabled pose to impov-
erished families, many parents abandon
their children or commit infanticide.
Emmanuel's own father deserts the
family after his birth, and his loving but
sickly mother dies at thirty-seven. But
she instills in her son the sense otpridc
and selfrworth that eventually inspires
him to prove to Ghana just what the
disabled are capable ofdoing.

on a bicycle donated by the Chal-
lenged Athletes Foundation], Emmanr
uel rides 379 miles across Ghana using
only his left leg. Winning support with
his leadership and example, Emmanuel
starts a crusade for government attenr
tion to disabled rights, spearheading
issues of public accessibility and mobil—
ity, employment, education and general
discrimination. He gains support for
disabled sports, establishes the Ema
manuel Education Fund (which grants
scholarships to disabled persons un»
able to afford schooling). and wins at
ceptance for the disabled at the King's
palace in l<ibi.

The documentary features disabled
athletes Jim McClaren, Rudy Garciae
Tolson and a host of others who join

in Emmanuel's cause. Look for Robin
Williams in award presentation foot—
age.

Emmanuel's message is one of
empowerment, of helping others help
themselves and of inspiring people to
do what they didn’t think possible.

Borat (2006)

Five shining stars for
American dream

As an American, 1 strch to under
stand and accept other cultures, for I
believe that tolerance is the glue that
holds the land of the free together.
Thus, while watching 347ml: Cultural
Lminingr afﬂmllimﬂr Mule Benefit
Glorious Nation of Kaznk/Jrzml, a film
about one man’s efforts to add ﬂavor
to this great big melting pot ofa courlr
try we live in, my heart swelled like an
eagle's chest and I cried red, white and
blue teats.

In this documentary, we watch as
a Kazakh man named Borat tours our
beautiful nation, spurred on by a heartr
warming love of our culture, but mostly
ofPamela Anderson.ln his interactions
with pcoplc along the way, we see how
even a man from a tiny Village in the
middle of nowheie can find love and
happiness in America. In addition to
providing us with this uplifting retell
ing or the American dream, this film
reminds us ofhow lucky we are to live
in the us. of A. seeing a fullrgrown
man who is oblivious to the wonders
of Christianity, women's suffrage and
table manners struggle to navigate his
way through the cultural labyrinth of
the Western world truly opens our eyes
to our good fortune. I can only hope
that this movie is shown in Kazakh-
stan, so that their people may see that
the golden rays ofWestern culture can
penetrate even the thick fog of their
ptovincialism.

Go see this charming movie, so
that the next time you see a guy in a
grey suit chasing around a chicken, you
won’t run away in fear, but simply say to
yourself: “He’s probably from Kazakh-
stan and doesn't know that nuggets are
on the dollar menu."

Only Human (2004)
ﬁfths?

Awkward humor is a
little too awkward

Sm: onouor (Only Human) by
husbandrandrwifc team Dominic Har
raii and Teresa de Pelegri is an attempt
at a sweet ramily comedy, though it is
more likely to make you smile than Mr
tiially laugh out loud.

The film begins with Leni (Marian
Aguiletci), a Spanish Jewish woman,
bringing her fiance Rafi (Guillermo
Toledo) to meet her family, who are
not yet awaie that he is a Palestinian
Muslim. The expected glossrwho’sr
comingetoedinner shenanigans are just
getting underway when the movie In’
ttoduces a plot twist in which Rafi may
or may not be an accidental murderer,
and his victim may or may not be Lcni's
filll‘lcls

TUESDAY

COURTESY li'lTP://OUTNOW.CH

The farcical absurdity of the situa-
tion that ensues is supposed to be dark-
ly comic, but much of the execution
comes off as uncomfortable and a little
creepy in a way that creates confusion
about the movie’s tone. You can tell the
directors are trying to make you laugh,
but you aren’t always entirely sure why
they think you will.

Where the movie shines is in its
characters, who are all warm and char-
ismatic and wellrperformcd by the
film's excellent cast. We care about the
people involved, but We may not care
enough to stay engaged in the rambling
and awkward plot, which takes sccmr
ingly random turns like introducing
and then immediately ul‘rlnll’oduclng
a second death. The humor that derives
from the personalities of the various
characters is more effective than the
obvious jokes about Rafi coming off as
a weirdo to Leni’s family because he's
trying to cover up the possible killing.

only Human has parts that make
you grin, parts that don’t make you
grin, and parts where you wonder why
or even iftlus scene is supposed to be
funny It also totally swipes thc ende
ing gag from a classic Marilyn Monroe
film.
