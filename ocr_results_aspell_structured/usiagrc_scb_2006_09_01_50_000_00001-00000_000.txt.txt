New kid on campus

Good food, bad
lines mark new
dining hall

Bv CAITLIN VAUGHAN AND NORA Coon

For students in past years, the quality of the dining hall food
ranked high on the list of complaints about the school. The new
dining facility in the Joseph F. Rosenfreld ’25 Campus Center was
supposed to change thatdand many believe it has. Complaints now,
however, focus on how long people have to wait in line before they
can get that improved food.

The problems with lines in the dining hall are two-fold. Waits
outside the dining hall can last ten to 15 minutes at peak times.
Inside the dining hall, popular mnde»to-order stations like pasta
and stir-fry mean more time
standing in line.

Dick Williams, director
ofDining services, said stu-
dents should have patience.
“People forget about stand-
ing in line at Cowlcs.” He
says that lines are more visible at the dining facility because it is a
central building where everyone goes to eat.

On Monday, lines stretched out the door ofthe Campus Center
and into the street. Neal wepking ’10 worried whether he would
get a chance to eat. “I don‘t know if I’ll be here [for lunch]7I have
class to get to." he said.

Wepking said he has skipped lunelr twice because ofthc line to
get into the dining hall. Williams admitted that long lines formed,
but said that on Tuesday there was no line to cat by 12:20 pm.

Extremely long lines only form at a few peak times, such as noon
and a pm, Williams suggested that students come to meals away
from those times to get shorter waits. Students with tight sc ed
lllcsﬁuch as a elassos getting our noon and another starting at
12:45 p.m.—may not have this ﬂexi 1ity.Exterrdeol dining hours, in
the original plan, were supposed to iillcvratc lines by giving students-
more time to eat.

Getting into the dining hall is only lralrrhe struggle for students
in a rush Long lines for fresh food can drive some to pro-made op-
tions."1’ve eaten [salad] ever since I came here because of the lines,"

a handful of options.
including "sandwich"
and “vapor" Out-takes
will only be open dur-
ing non»peak hours lor

Rumor—There are
plans to add a second
P-Catd checker.
Fiction—While the
dining hall is designed
so that it is possible
to have multiple P-
Card checkers, Dining
Services Director Dick
Williams said by e-mail
that adding another

increase crowds in the
area where food is

a worker's strike.

Center not
yet done

Six to seven weeks left

rsv RACHEL FIELDS & T. J. HAWLEV

When prospective students visited
last spring, they were told to expect
a brand new student dining facility
and student union. Instead, returning
Grinnell students were greeted with
buzzing power tools and clouds of dust
as they walked through construction
sites to enter the Joseph F. Rosenfreld
’25 Center.

Vice President for Student Services
Tom crady has overseen the campus
center project since its inception more
than 12 years ago. Crady said that the
remaining construction will be con-r
pleted within the next six to seven
weeks, and expressed sympathy for stir
dents affected by the delays.

“We can handle this six [more]
weeks," crady said.

Crady said that the construction
delays were mainly due to problems
transporting materials to the work
site. Marble ﬂooring for the dining
hall and elevator was held for weeks
rrr New York City customs. After be-
ing cleared. the material was shipped
to Weitz Construction headquarters in
Omaha before finally being brought to
Grinnell. The company also had dir-
ficulty keeprng wood paneling for rhe
walls in stock.

Recent weather conditions have
also contributed to delays. Some lantle
scaping has been postponed due to rain,
and workers have recently workttl in
bad weather in order to complete the
building as quickly as possible.

SGA reform
on agenda of
Hall, Billups

BY HARRV KREJSA AND JusTlN ERICKSON

A cool and collected pairisGA President Chris
Hall '07 and Vice President Michael Billups ’077
were planning the future oftheir administration. with
Billups laughing and Hall smiling rn gym shorts and a
bandarra.At the core oftheir plans is a desire to fulfill
goals unmet by last year‘s SGA.

Like the administration of John Bohman '06 and
Chris Ochoa ’06 before them, Hall and Billups want
to clarify self-governance, streamline SGA and tackle
financial issues between students and the college.

One of last year’s administration’s priorities was a
clariﬁcation ofselr-govcrnance, especially in the rvake
ofseveral drugrrelated arrests During the year, Ochoa
formulated a document defining self-governance, but
rtwrs not publicized, Hall and Billups want to star-ta
campus drscrrsoion based on Ochoa's documentf‘D'ls-
cussion of what [selfrgover'nance] means is extremely
important," said Hall. “Selfrgovernancc is a thoughts
ful process being thoughtful of others, and expectr
ing them to be thoughtful ofyou.”

Hall and
Billups believe
the best way
to ensure the
r e s p o n s i b le
use of self-
governance is
through the
Judicial Counr
crl ()udCo),
which has been
controversial at times.]udCo is composed ofa taculty
member and six students and hears cases where stu-
dents are thought to have severely violated regulations
or have infringed on the rights of their follow stu-
dents. It determines innocence or guilt and has some
authority to levy punishment. Billups said that many
believe that JudCo is contrary to the nature of selfr
governance, but he disagrees. "It is there for that frve
percent ofpeople who abuse self—governance."

Hoping to continue down last year’s path of res
form, Hall and Billups have set their sights on improv—
ing SGA’s operations this year. They hope to instill
more “institutional memory" in an organization that
holds elections every semester and maintain an agen—
da’s momentum through the year even as membership

chagges.
