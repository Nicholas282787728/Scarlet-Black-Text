NAFTA Debated this Week
During WID Symposium

By Riva Sharples

AFFA,itsimpacton women,
and its impacton the coun-
tries of Canada, the United

States, and Mexico was one of the
key issues discussed this week dur-
ing Grinnell’s annual Women in De»
velopment symposium. Most of the
week’s WID lectures focused on the
policies and practices of economic
dcvelopmentregarding women. One
lecture dealt with women and devel-
opment in the Philippines and any
other covered the issue of women's
health in Palestine.

The issue of NAFTA was de-
bated at a panel discussion Wedncsr
day.

NAFTA, which stands for the
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment, is a proposed arrangement be—
tween Canada, the United States, and
Mexico that wouldallow for the “free
tradcofgoodsand services"between
the threenations,aceordingtoNancy
Naples, an assistant professor of So—
ciology and Women's Studies at the
University of California at Irvine.

“NAFTA was signed by George
Bushrightbeforetheendofhispresir

dency ended," she explained. “The
agreement is going to come up to a
vote before Congress in November.
Clintonisnbig supporteroftheagree—
mm, but it is very importantthat we
understand all of the issues behind it
before we support it.”

NAFTA notonly allows for free
trade betweenthethreeceuntnes,but
also contains a lot of smaller clauses
and arrangements that might cause
problems, according to Naples.
“The document is over 200 pages
long, and it covers a lot more than
free trade,” she said. “One example
is that after seven years, one clause
says that Mexico can export sugar to
the United States ifthey have a sure
plus. This could cause problems for
the UnitedStates. Andthat'sjustone
example. We need to keep in mind a
few things when looking at NAFTA:
thedepression of wagesitmightcause
on both sides of the borders and the
environmental and health concerns.”

John Mutti,professoroflntema-
tional Economics at Grinnell Col-
lege, shed light on the more positive
effects the document might have.

“What NAFTA does is provide a
treaty framework,“ he said, i‘Once a

treaty is signed, a treaty commits you
asacountry, NAFTA would provide
some certainty in Mexican affairs
and certainty brings investment. An
economy matattractseapilalwillspur
development,”

The affect NAFTA might have
on farmers was the main concern of
panelist Denise O’Brien, an organic
farmer and political activist who
farms and lives near Atlantic, Iowa.

“] havebeen workingon NAFTA
for 3 lo 4 years," she said. “And the
farmers I represent have some pretty
big concerns about it. One veterinar-
ian I talked with said that it will take
20 years to get rid of tuberculosis in
Mexican milk. Also, the Mexican
gevcmment lets farmers use hor-
mones that are not approved for use
here, so there would deﬁnitely be a
health concem with free trade. And
we already have a surplus of milk in
the United Suites as it is.“

O’Brien, who says that she is
“all for international trade,“ ques—
tions the expediency with which
Clinton is going about the NAFTA
plan.

“Clinton, with his republican al-
