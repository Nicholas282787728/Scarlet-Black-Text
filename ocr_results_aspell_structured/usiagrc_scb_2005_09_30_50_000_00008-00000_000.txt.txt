OPINION

Sépiember 30, 2005

 

Students in my rutoiiul and I went
to hear Jane Goodall at Drake Univer—
sity in Des Moines on Sept. 22, This
famous priniatologisr spoke about fol-
lowing her childhood dieam to study
animals in Africa, about making the
best ofyour opportunities, and the be“,
cm of supporting inquiring minds.

Mostly she spoke about peace
and making this world a bcrrer place,
a place where orangutans and chimps
can live in their natural habitat, a place
where your opponent is your neighbor,
not your enemy.

In my words, I would say that her
talk was about choices. The choices
that we make in our daily lives are as
important as the choices companies
make about their logging operations or
profits. There are the obvious choices,
such as not buying products made with
palm oil, which is an,ingredient taken
from plants grown in farms that are de-
stroying the natural habitat of the great

the scarlet and black

apes. But there are sllbtle ones, too.
Choosing to considei your opponent
your neighbor rather than your enemy
is one that Goodall mentioned

Choosing education over ignorance is

make many choices many times in the
course of a day or a semester, but how
often are we deliberative, reﬂective and
aware ofolir choices?

Choice is a cognitive construct. It

will and conscious mind. (The behav

iorist rebuttal' is a future column.) It
is amazing to me that so many things
in life appear to be unchosen—as irwe
have to feel this way because ofx or
we have to
act this way
because of
y. But upon
r e fl e c t i o n,
we find that
by choosing
what to feel
or how to act, we are working With the
situation rather than against it.

It has helped my attitude many a
late night when I choose to grade par
pci-s rather than being forced to grade
them. As you know, choice isn‘t easy,
but it is easier than ﬁghting apathy To
borrow from Indian/1 lane: Midi/M errt
Ci‘umdt‘, choose wisely.

Whether it be problem solving or
enjoyment of mere existence, choice is

a powerful tool Do you choose to pro—
crastinate on assignments? lfyou are a
procrastinator, you have chosen to be.
it not, you would choose to rearrange
your life to be piepared in advance or
deadlines. (Those of you who hare to
be late know what I mean.)

Choose to sleep! Students (and
fellow faculty) too often choose to be
awake 20 hours a day and push them
selves beyond productive limits. Better
yet, choose to sleep at night! Choose to
bounce out ofbed when the alarm goes
off at 7 am. Choose to never use the
snooze alarm. Yes, I'm serious,

lfyoll are still reading this column
(pseudoinsomniacs stopped, I’m sure),
my take-away message is that peace
begins with ourselves, with our choices.
Knowing what to choose is what edu-
cation is all about. World peace begins
with ourselves. Choose to live an edUc
cared life, and peacefulness will be in-
side ofyou, by choice.

Dialing 911: when U.S. law enforcement breaks the law

Chenibic-looldng children, barely old enough to be
in elementary school, gazed at us from across police
lines. Standing next to their parents, they held signs
that depicted anal sex and proclaimed in bold letters,
“God Hates Fags,"

They had come to protest the awarding of the “Mat-
thew Shepard Award" to an Iowa City activist. The
scholarship, named in honor of
a gay University orWyomiug
student brutally murdered in
1998, recognizes the achieve-
ments otgay and lesbian Iowa
high school seniors.

' Home from Grinnell
1 lined up with town City
community members to “
show support for the high school student activist. My
desire to leap across the' street and rescue the small
captives of their parents'hatred was tempered by belief
that these protestors lacked meaningﬁll inﬂuence. 1 was
comforted by the fact that counterrprotestors greatly
outnumbered protesters. Police made sure protestors
did not step out of their designated areas. The law was
on our side.

As I left the protest, I remember thinking with
satisfaction that 1998 was long
gone. I thought there would be no
death in the new “Culture Wars”
ovcr gay rights in America. I was
wrong.

the nation’s fifty largest police departments.

A Native American transgender woman reported
to AI that two Los Angeles Police officers beat and
raped her in an alleyway, yelling "whore" and “tag
got." In San Antonio, police wrongtiilly accused a
Larimi transgender woman of stealing and reportedly
“seaiched” her genitals while refusing to provide badge

numbers, In Brooklyn,
New York, two lesbi-
ans of color called 911
after homophobic ate
racks of physical and
veibal abuse.

According to re
ports, one woman was
bleeding from the head but when police heard it was
a homophobic crime, they told ambulances to leave
without aiding her. Kelly McAllister, a white trance
gender woman, was allegedly beaten. tied and dragged
across pavement by police in Sacramento, California.

AI said police placed her in a jail cell with a man
“who struck, choked, bit and raped her. That inmate
received a mere three-month sentence. No ofﬁcer has
been disciplined for the incidents surrounding Kelly’s
incarceration."

Bursting the Bubee

Wrongful search, arrest and incur
ceration are not the only problems.
Torture of LGBT individuals per-
sists in prison. The ongoing case of
Roderick Johnson, released in 2003
from Allred prison in Texas, dem-
onstrates prison guards’ complicity
in social torture ofLGBT prisoners.
Johnson ﬁled a 2002 lawsuit against
seven prison officials who he says violated the Eighth
Amendment prohibiting cruel and unusual punishr
ment. A witness said Johnson was sold for $3 to 57 to
be raped many times over an lsrmonth period.

According to the New Yai‘l’ Times, Johnson’s suit
says prison onions “failed to protect him and took sar
distic pleasure in his victimization" as a sexual slave.

Defendant Jimmy Bowman reproduced victims
blaming myths about rape in his testimony According
to the New York Timct, Bowman claimed evidence of
rape required “possible broken bones” and “sometimes
might be a little worse." As decades of legal scholars
ship have shown, the absence ofbroken bones does not
indicate conscur to sex. Even implied threat otviolence
makes any sex act a rape.

Threats against Johnson weie explicir- witness [or
tified that Johnson would be beaten and stabbed for
physically resisting ripe. Yet Jimmy Bowman insists
that Johnson’s “seven written pleas for help" cannot
prove rape. Bowman’s belief that guards should not in
tervene until prisoners are almost dead demonstrates
severe problems in the institutional structure of pris-
ons. Prisons must undergo reforms and guards must be
taught to prevent sexual violence

Police departments musr implement training and
policies regarding interactions with LGBT individu—
als. AI notes that Sergeant Brett Parson has pioneered
training about LGBT communities for police in the
Washington DC area.

The city of Hollywood has created a Transgender
Task Force Regardless of their positions in the “cul-
ture war citizens should aid these groups to protect all
people from rape and violence.

As Johnson’s case continues, we must work to en—
sure thatTexas complies with International and United
States law. People who want to help ensure that law ens
forccmcnt omcials treat all individuals justly can con—
tact elected officials as well as prison representatives to
ask what they are doing about discrimination against
LGBT people.

Contact Mike Viesca, spokesman for the Texas De-
partment of Criminal Justice, which runs Texas state
prisons. Ask him what concrete reforms Texas plans to
implement to prevent sexual slavery Urge Sacramento
county Main Jail to discipline omcers responsible for
Kelly McAllister’s brutal arrest and incarceration We
cannot allow law enforcement to break the law any
more.
