Did you

National
Chemistry
Day? -

by Marc Bass

A highaschool chemistry teacher
once said to me. ”Marc, chemistry
is electrons!” Several years later.
Mark Dultield iclass of ’87) said,
“Chemistry is my lilel ” Sometime
early in 1937. the American
Chemical Society declared,
“Chemistry is everywhere: " Well,
all oi these may very well be true,
but in the case of Grinnell College,
chemistry is on the second floor (or
third floor, it you like the new
numbering system) at the science
building.

By this time, you are all asking
yourselves, ”What is he getting
at?" Well, what i am getting at
pertains to that third quotation
from the American Chemical
Society (herealter known as the
ACS) when the Acs so aptly, and
quit correctly, declared that
chemistry is everywhere, as Larry
Bird and Magic Johnson might say
about Converse AllrStars, they also
decided that Eriday, November 6.
1987 would be “National Chemistry
Day.” That is where i iinally come
into the picture. i am, along with
Bryan Coughlin, the «so-president
oi the Grinnell College chapter of
the Student Affiliates oi the
American Chemical Society
(hereafter known as the SA-ACS)
It is in this capacity that i write
this article, so don’t worry 7 no
more angry young man routine!

Anyway, some months ago, at a
departmental meeting Mr
uhlenhopp announced that this Na-
tional Chemistry Day was coming
up and he thought it would be a
nice idea tor us to do something to
recognize the occasion in some
way. Mr. Minelli, the SAVACS
tremember your abbreviations
now) adviser, agreed, and he sug»
gested an open house that alter-
noon [or other students, Well, heck,
this didn’t seem like it was enough
work. I mean, we had GEES to
study tor, and grad school applica~
tions to work on, and many other
projects to deal with, but still
Bryan and l weren’t reeling
challenged enough. what did we
do'l We went to John Hopkins over
invAdmission and got a list of local
iwithin a (is-kilometer or approx
imately 40~mile radiusl high
schools. Mri Minelli then wrote to
these high schools and personally
invited their chemistry teachers
and students to join us {or our open
house.

Okay, this is where you, the
students, faculty, stall, and ad
ministration of Grinnell College
come in. I am now inviting you to
join us tor our open house. “What
is in it for me?“ you might ask,
huts! When else can you come up
and see Mike ”Charlie Tuna"
Giardello play around on a very ex»
pensive computer in a very cold

To the Editor:

You know, all the debate over
core curriculum and Waldo Walker
is providing some very interesting
evidence tor a theory on cultural
regression in the 19805. There have
been some very wellrsupported
and evocative letters printed in a
well~respected student campus
publication recently about why
core curriculum is a sort of Anti-
Grinnell phenomenon; you know,
why isn't Grinnell just llke any
other college except (or its open
curriculum, right?

But what gets me is some or the
more basic maniiestations of
anger on campus about core curs
riculum. Quad is now being inun-
dated with tray artwork and
engravings on the subject. The
other night, nothing could shroud
the profound words ”STOMP
WALDOH and ”NO WAY
WALKER" permanently scratch
ed on the tray.

But what appears to be the true
culture sample, if you will, are the
HECTORS on campus. The one
that I think epitomizes the Walker
issue in particular is the one in the
Main Hall lst men’s room. A HECV
TOR with sharp teeth is chewing
on a tiny little ﬁgure of Waldo
Walker, who is screaming for help
The title 0i this anonymous work
appears to be “Hector’s Revenge.”

Now, while it‘s all well and good
that people can express their opi-
niDns ireely on campus, this HEC-
TOR scares me a little. While some
well-Written letters in recent 8 and

thermite reaction (a favorite at
Chem 129 students and prois
alike). And it you happen to catch
one oi the “Chemistry Magic
Shows” (wardrobe courtesy or
Mr, Wubbels), you will get to
watch Bryan and me strut our
stuii. Who knows, maybe we will
make one small mistake, and you
could be witness to one of those
great chemistry accidents you
thought only happened in Times
Beach or Chernobyl!

So, it you are just hanging
around this afternoon, between
1'30 and 4:30, say to yourself (in
your best German accent), “Okay,
in dees case, we go to the
chemistry department open
house!” Show up for the whole
afternoon or just one hour. It Will
be painless and fun, honest. Oh,
and by the way, there will be
FREE REFRESHMENTS. Was
that subtle enough ior you77

newspapers about current issues
such as the Bork nomination, the

up with the earth.

Now don’t anthropologists
acknowledge the existence oi sym-
pathetic magic in the Neolithic
age. or at least in a number at
speciiic cases, that wounded
animals painted on cave walls
were meant to be representative oi
ones that would be killed later in an
organized hunt? Could this be the
