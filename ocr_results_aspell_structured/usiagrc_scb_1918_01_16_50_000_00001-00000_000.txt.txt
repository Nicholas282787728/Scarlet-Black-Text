From my shelter. I might say from
the "rats" head quarters or the Hat

I am Very happy despite the rats,

roar of cannon. and the scream ril
shells, "like the last wail of lost

The interior of my underground
dwelling is even less cheerful than the
landscape outside. It lacks light. and
above all things a stove. I sleep on a
stretcher hung from the ceiling, over
which runs a road. whereon all night
long troops march. munition. trains
and great guns roll. creaking and
grinding over the stones of the way.
Nevertheless I sleep very well. provid-
ed a stretcher bearer does not call me
because some poor “poilu” must he ta-
ken to the hospital. or if the divel'A
sions of the rats do not grow too
noisy.

stationed on a canal, and we move our

It takes only a minute to light my

SUIENTISTS WILL BE
NEEDED AFTER WAR

Professor Hendrixson Says Gov-
ernment Must Now Employ
Many Amateurs

“There are too many amateurs in
chemical work already,” said Prot.
w. S, Hendrl son during an interview
yesterday. "The urgent need of cheni-
ists has brought many men of incum-
plete education into government posi-
tions."

Prof. Hendrixson emphasized the tree
mendous need of educated men today,
especially in technical lines. He point-
ed out that ii the war continued. the
progress of the world would'he seri-
ously hindered thru the lack of train-
ed men to carry on the necessary
technical operations or the country.
The officers and important lneu in
government service today are college
graduates. The continuation or the
war makes it necessary that there be
no laelr of men capable of becoming
otticeis.

’l‘clls l’llrllosr‘. (Ii Drillt

“The draft is no disgrace.” the pro
fessor remarked. "The government
organized a selective draft that men
who could best serve their country by
continuing their education now, could
do so. while older and better prepared
men could ﬁll the present need.

"The draft age has been set at 21
for a reason—that the young men. uni
der the draft age, who intend to study
technical subjects. may finish their
education and be valuable later on."
