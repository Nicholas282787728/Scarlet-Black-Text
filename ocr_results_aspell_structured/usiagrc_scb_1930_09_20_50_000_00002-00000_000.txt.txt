GROUP CONFERENCES 0N VOCATIONS.

Group conferences on vocations, which were
held “'edncsday afternoon for the benefit of all
the new students, are an innovation in Grinllcll col-
lege this year, and mark the introduction of a
practice of great significance to all stndcms and
consequently to the college.

Ill a recent article in the Satnrda Evening
Post, “Why Students Fail.” there were included
two reasons, and the only two reasons, according
to the Writer of the article. why students succeed.
One of these reasons was proper motivation.

The selective methods by which Grillnell
chooses those entering its portals insures a high
degree of intelligence among its cmbr ' ~ ndcnts.
To help these students connect their ab es to the
driving power of a sound ideal is, ill a large meas-
ure, the purpose of the newly inaugurated confor—
ences on vocations—to provide the motivation to
success.

The leader of each conference attempted to
give the students an accurate picture of wllat they
could expect ill the line of work they had chosen.
The courses necessary to their college preparation
for the work. the conditions to be In“. null the
obstacles to ho ovcrcolllc. as Well as the advanton s
to be expected in the actual practice .of the nor
itself, all formed a part of the picture. It is llnp-
cd that the student, posse sing a lruc knowledge
of the work he " to do will he better ahlt: to fit
hilllscll‘ for tho, ta .

Perhaps the conference on “How to Choose n
Vocation.” conducted for those who had no defin-
itc plan of actinll scloctod for tllclllsclvrs. was. the
most important ol' the entire schedule of lllt‘t‘l’ll
for to uttclllpt a ccllt-g‘c course without a doﬁllilo
goal is almost certain to invite failure

DOES COLLEGE GUARANTEE A JOB?
By Pros. .1. ii. T. Main
(From The Grinnell Good News, July, 1930)

A business man said to me the other day, “My son
graduated from your college and is still without a job.”
This man estimates the value of a college education at
zero because his son is not an a monthly payroll, The
son was the failure, not the college!

A college does not guarantee a job to everybody:
nor does life guarantee a job. College and life are
alike in this. The college does open doors to life’s
highway where opportunities are to he found by those
who seek them. College shows opportunities where
none was seen before. It gives us an acquaintance
with ourselves; it makes us at home in the world; it en-
riches our spirits and expands our understanding of life
in numbcrless ways. It does all this and moreiif we
do our part as partners in the business.

The reply to the man who has a son without a job
is just like this: 90 per cent of those who go
to college do get jobs. A considerable number become
famous in them. And all of them as a result are qual-
ified to he more useful as citizens in our free country.
The boy without a job didn't use his advantage!

No the college doesn’t guarantee a job. It does in-
finitely more. it does things that cannot be measured
in terms of money. It opens the way to many jobs
never imagined by the one out of college.

The college does guarantee to help you get ready
for a job. It guarantees to help you make the right
choice among many possible jobs. A wrong choice is of—
ten El tragic mistake. College guarantees to give an
initial advantage that will carry you far, if only you de-
termine to go far.

Opportunity will not push you into success. Rather
you must often take a slim chance and make of it a
great success, That is where you show, with the help
of your college, your native power.

Life is short. Four yea-rs out of it for college is .1
heavy draft on time. No! it isn’t a draft at all, It is
the miracle moment which makes time last longer. We
do not live in years but in deeds. Fifty years lived by
one who knows how to work and serve and achieve is
equivalent to a 100 commonplace and uninformed years.
Four years in college is the atom of radium which makes
of‘cliance a challenge and an opportunity to live glor-
iously and abundant. it will, if you use it, make
life an ever growing urge to further achievement.

THANK YOU
(From The Grinnell Register, Sept. is, 193m
The first issue of The Sear-let and Black, the col—
lege paper, made its appearance on the streets and on
the campus Wednesday evening, and proved to be a
very creditable publication.

The issue is filled with college news and carries, too,
a liberal amount of advertising. While the majority of
the students are not hack yet, the publication was weir
corned by the fresh who are getting into the swing of
the school spirit.

The Register congratulates the editorial staff and
the‘ business department of The Scarlet and Black upon
their initial effort.
