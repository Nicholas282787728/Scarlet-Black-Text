Council Asks
For Changes.
In Cul' Syslem

Unofficial suggestions for
changes in the present class cut
system were niade at the Stu—
dent Council meeting last night:

Members suggested that any
student confined to the intir.
mary for illness he excused
rroru classes I: that idea is not
accepted by the personnel board,
the council suggested excuses
be issued for a minimum of two
days in the infirmary instead of
the present three.

It was felt an unlimited ac.
tivity out plan would he more
practical than the present plan
which gives a maximum of six.
Various ideas about allowing
additional ems were discussed;
one idea was to base the num»
ber of cuts on the grade aver»
age of students. Several council
members said that students have
not been properly warned when.
they near the end of their quota.‘

Much of the confusion con.
Cemingyithe new cut sysbem is
due to a misinterpretation made
at the student leader’s conier-
ence last spring. The council
stated that class attendance
could be improved if faculty
members would give more in.
teresting lectures.

it was announced that a
United Nations conterenoe would ‘
be held at the University of
Wisconsin, March 23, 29, and‘
all. Room and board charges at
the conference will be $5.50.
Anyone is eligihle to attend.
