Rape can and does LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

happen at Grinnell

Onceagain,thewriting on thewallhascausedcontroversy on theGrinnell
campus~this time on the wall of the women’s bathroom in Burling Library.
The first reaction to this issue on the pan of many students was shock. At a
liberal arts college in a small midweslem town, where students are suppos»
edly enlightened and mature, one likes to think that ugly things like rape and
sexual harrassment don’t happen.

But naivete will get us nowhere. The truth is that these things HAVE
happened and need to be faced. And
something is terribly wrong if victims
of rape and harrassment feel that the
only place in which they can express
their pain is on a bathroom wall.

How did this situation go so far?
Have Student Affairs and the Presi-
dential Hearing Board, the avenues
through which action against such incidents is taken, failed victims of rape
and harrassment? Action has been taken against some offenders, and Student
Affairs has attempted to provide counseling for victims. In addition, the
college has changed some of its policies concerning conﬁdentiality and has
attempted to clarify the process by which action is taken in order to aid
victims of such crimes.

Butts this enough? Apparently not, for many victims still complain that
Student Affairs does not have enough background in rape counseling to
effectively deal with these cases. What is necessary, then, is mandatory
training in rape counseling for resident advisors, Presidential Hearing Board
members, and student staff members, In addition to this, education about
rape/sexual harrassment should be mandatory for students in order to both
prevent these incidens and inform students about what actions to take if
these incidents do occurl Finally, victims should have somewhere to voice
complaints about the handling of their cases.

The forums held Wednesday and Thursday night show that Grinnellians
are willing to face the problems of rape and sexual harrassmcnt headron.
When made aware of the problem, students showed their concern.

But next time, let's hope it doesn't take writing on a wall for us to realize
what is rightbefore our eyes.

SGA cabinet ignores student input

To the editor,

I am writing in response to a dis-
cussion I had with my hall senator
this evening. She mentioned two
things I found very interesting. One
was the continual suspension of the
“Golden Rule” by SGA this semes-
ter. This rule stipulates that senators
must be informed of any business
subject toavotc 24 hours in advance.
Thislcisasenaior thinkon the matter,

and also seek the opinions of their
constituency, By violating this rule,
the cabinet is able to sneak items
throughloint Board. One item passed
in this way wasan appropriation ofan
additional 51,000 for the Coffee
House. This brings me to the second
item. Apparently a senator brought
up the issue ofsmoking in the Coffee
House. ThoCabinct member running

Imposters collect beer money

To the editor.

Last Saturday two members of the
student body falselyclaimed torepre-
sent ISO. They walked around North
Campus collecting money for beer
for the ISO party. On behalf of the
ISOcabinetand thelntemationai Stu-
dents Organization at large, I would
Iiketoinforrn thceampuscommunity
that we did not serve beer at our party

and that we never intended to do so.
ISO has nothing to do with thecollec-
tion ofmoney; it was initiated by two
single individuals. The ISO cabinet
condemns their action and encourr
ages all the Sludans who made con
tributions to collect therrmoney from
these two individuals.

the Coffee House was essentially a
private business, it was not up to the
senators who represent the student
body at Grinnell to decide whether or
not smoking is allowable in the Cofr
ice House. Regardless of how one
feels aboutthisissuc,Cabinet'sposi-
tion |S astounding. Why can’t the
students of Grinnell who gave, not
lent, the $4,000 to start the Coffee
House have any say as to what the
environment in there should be? This
“business" was initiated and over-
seen by SGA, so surely SGA has the
authority to discuss this issue, This
incident is telling of the imperious-
ness and condescension that much of
the SGA cabinet has shown towards
the general student body this year. It
is irksomc that the concerns of stu~
dens are shoved aside for the pet
projects of SGA.

THE REAL WORLD
Interning With Leo the llama

I‘m getting a little stressed about
my summer plans.

I‘m an English major intending to
go into editing, and for the summerI
ﬁgured I'd ﬁnd myselfari internship
withanicelittlepublishinghouseand
settle down to learn the ropes of basic
book-making.Noproblcm,lthought.

I did thercsumc thing (as honestly

cover letters that were slicker than
banana peels dipped in lard, and then
I flipped strategically through
Burling'sAmericariPuinshcrsGuide
and mailed off my package to all of
thepresses thatwere located in scenic
areas with low monthly precipitation
averages and at least one four-star
rcstraunt.

I was amazed at how quickly I got
a response.

“Hello, is this Laura Moran?“

I sat up blearily, trying to unravel
the tangled who's, whatfor's, and
whyAeight-a.m.’s that were slogging
around in my brain.

“Umm. Yeah. Whozzis?”

“Good morning, Laura!” The
woman’s voice was suspiciously
cheery for such an early hour. Oh

“Laura,thisisMaryCostello,frorn

“We'd love to have you inlem this
summer,” she burbled. “How soon
can you start‘!“

“Uh.. .Igetouton May 15,” I said,
a little hesitantly. What, did she ex-
pect an immediate committmcnt?
“Actually. I haven't heard from the
other places yet—"

“It’ll be fantastic," she continued,
"You'll love It here! And I’m sure
you'll getalong with the animalsjust
fine."

“What7”l must’ve misheard her. I
thought. Eight 2i.m. ear wax.

“Oh,just a handful, really," Mary
clariﬁed, “We’re down to just the
goats and the cattle, and Randy‘s fer»
rets. Oh, and of course Leo."

“Leo?"

”The llama."

“Oh,” Something told me that I’d
hooked 2i fish that was a little too big
for me to handle. “Look, I was soriof
hoping for an emphasis on publish-
ing. I mean, I'm an English major—”

“Oh, don’t worry, we all speak it
here," she assured me blithley.

“That‘snotthepoint,"Isard,starir

“I’ll be WHAT?!”

“Well, we could put you in with

“Look, I don't thinki"

”And you'll eat like a queen! Just

Clearly, it was time for decisive
action.
