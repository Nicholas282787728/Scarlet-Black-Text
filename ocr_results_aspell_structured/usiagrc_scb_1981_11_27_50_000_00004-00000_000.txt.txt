To the Editor:

Recently, there has been a great deal of
confusion regarding the dismissal of two
Grinnell College staff members. We, as a
group of individuals closely associated
with the Computer Center and the men
fired, are concerned with the damaging
rumors being spread and [eel a need lor
further clariﬁcation of the issue. Since the
administration has stated a reluctance to
release further information as it might
prove damaging to those men involved,
we, as close associates of Mark Grundler,
director at Administrative Computing, and
David Renaud, assistant director of Ad-
ministrative Computing, wish to present
our view of the events that transpired.

On Wednesday, Nov. 18, Mary Verkade,
an academic programmer, was observed
accessing the personal computer lites of
other people's accounts, The next morning
this irregularity was brought to the atten-
tion of Mark Grundler, who filed a formal
complaint with Executive Vice-President
Waldo Walker. Later that day Thomas
Moberg. Ms Verkade's supervisor and the
director oi Academic computing, met
with Walker to discuss this action's possi-
ble status as a violation of college policy.

That afternoon, Mr. Grundler and Mr.
Renaud were called into Mr. Walker's ol~
{ice and presented with termination
papers. Mr, Walker listed the charges as
“obstructing academic computing" and
also cited Mr. Grundler‘s and Mr,
Renaud‘s memberships in a certain group
known lacetlously as the “Tom Moberg
Fan Club.“ At this time, Mr. Grundlei‘ and
Mr. Renaud were shown messages copied
from their mail files which connected
them with this primarily student associa-
tion. The members of the “club," had ex-
changed some messages in the computer's
electronic mail system, primarily as a ten
sion release for computer users who were
dismayed with some of Moherg's policies.
The actual message presented to Renaud
Thursday simply asked the "fan club"
members it they wished to receive com~
puter mail from him.

When given his termination letter, Mr.
Renaud immediately requested that the
reasons for his dismissal be specified.
Walker stated that the membership in the
fan club was evidence of unprofessional
conduct, but would give no explanation tor
the charge of "obstructing academic com-
puting." As Renaud was not working in die

Come to’ihis special event!

academic computing system. we find this
charge somewhat questionable, Likewise,
Grundler's dismissal was attributed in
part to “obstruction of academic com-
puting" as evidenced by a message he had
sent to Renaud, implying that Moberg's
policies would lead to a loul-up oi the
academic computing system

These are the facts as we see them‘
Given our understanding of the situation
and our association with Mark Grundler
and David Renaud, we feel that our his
sights might prove helplul to others in the
campus community, At this time we would
also like to express our immense
dissatisfaction with the “rings, and the
way in which this matter was handled in
the first place, Mr, Grundler and Mr.
Renaud were faced with termination
papers beiore they were even warned that
their positions were in jeopardy. and thus
had no opportunity to answer these
charges.

Secondly, the situation has raised
crucial questions about the security oi
computer mail files. During the investiga
tion which led to the dismissals. mail files
of several staff members and at least one
student were accessed Without their

knowledge or consent. Though both Mr.
Mnberg and Mr. Grundler had the right to
authorize such searches under certain cirr
cumstances by virtue at their positions,
the justification given, i,e., that the "Tom
Moberg Fan Club" was a violation of Col-
lege policy, seems somewhatlai-ietched, if
membership in such an entity is grounds
for searching staff and student mail files,
one wonders if the college security policy
is not totally meaningless.

We hope that the above statement has
served our purpose in enlightening the
campus community as to our views. We
feel that the facts as herein presented do
not justify the dismissals of two of the most
knowledgeable members or the computing
staff. While we recognize the difficulties
inherent in making such administrative
judgements, we strongly urge Vice-
President Walker to unconditionally
reinstate Mark Grundler and DaVid
Renaud to their ionner positions. —
