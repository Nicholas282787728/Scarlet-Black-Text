Mr. and Mrs. Car-l Compton, both oi
the class of 1913, are now in Omsk,
the new capital of the All-Russian gov-
crnmcnt, doing work among the refu-
gees of the community. Compton air
ter his graduation, went to Mar-seven,
Turkey, as instructor in Anatolia col
lege. He assisted in the defense of
the college against the Turks, and was
in some interesting diplomatic misel
sions in that country.

A letter from Mrs. Compton appearing
in the Des Moines chllster, tells. or
some of their adventures.

Looking to America.

“We’ve been here at Omsk about
two weeks trying to get some informa-
tion about the refugees wlro are strung

.all across Siberia. There are 300,000
in Siberia alone and. countless num—
bers in Russia. There is practically
no work for them and no place to live
except in box ears, and most of them
are penniless. w ter will come to
this particular region in about ﬁve or-
six weeks, although it‘s hard to realize
now *(Aug. 9), Many of them arc
sick now with cholera and typhus and
there is actually no medicine at all in
this part of the country. There iS
perhaps food enough to feed them, but
there isn’t nearly enough money to
buy the food with. Carl has been
working with refugees in Samara, but
it's been just like pouring water into
a sieve because the mass of refugees is
no better oft today than they were a
month ago. He started a hospital
there, and a soup kitchen, but he felt
that he must ﬁnd out it there is not
some way to reach the majority of
them. His idea was to start some
industrial work and in that Way give
employment to thousands, as we did in
the Caucausus last winter, but there
seems no possible way to get hold of
raw material.

Men Dig Trenches
On “Day of Rest.”

Build Obstructions for Bayonet
Course a Nearly Completed
Now.

The “day ot' rest" granted to the
men Friday was used to great advftll»
tage in digging the trenches and build-
'ing the various obstructions iu the
bayonet course which is being built
southeast of the barracks. The course
is fast near-lug completion. The men
who were digging did not look very
sick, according to outsiders who had
heard the report that the men were
sick and could not come out.

The bayonet course will he the scene
of some exciting battles or practice
battles when it is completed. 'It is an
elaborate affair with many lines of
dummy men to stab when the men
rush over the top with their hayonets
ﬁxed.

The men who were not put on the
digging gang found many things Waite
ing for their attention. The “‘1" was
closed tor the ﬁrst time since the men
have been .here and they noticed the
loss. The civilians were in great Lle-
rnand to get candy bars and other ar-
ticles down town. i

Hal-s Been at Camp Shelby in Home
Service 7 Now on Way to
France.

 

Professor Paul Peck spoke to the

in the quadrangle droning room
mm; night on the nature of Red
Cross work in the camps.

For the past seven months Professor
Pcek has been a Red Cross worker or
a "worry alleriotor" in_ Camp Shelby,
MiSS sippi. At present he is making
a.tour of the camps in this country to
compare methods and complete his
training before he leaves for France
at the end of this month.

Aim Is Non-Seemrlhn.

“Humanitarian is the aim of the
aim of the Red Cross, for the relief of
'phy icai and mental Suffering," he
said.

its purpose is not educational or re-
ligious or for entertainment, as is that
ol the Y. M. C. A., or the Knights of
Columbus, or the Jewish Welfare Soci—
ety, But it is strictly non-sectarian.
supportedby the people of all faiths.

Relief of TWO Kinds.

The relief it offer-s i of two kinds—-
military and civil. Civilian relief is a
large branch of the work, which aims
to protect from want the families ot
soldiers and sailors.

Investigation of home conditions
form a large part of the work in camp,
he said. When a man applies for- aid,
strict inquiry is made, then if the
conditions warrant, the man is loaned
or given money, or recommended for
s furlough, or whatever may be his dif:
ﬁcuity

That the Red cross works in league
with the officers, Prof. Peck emphar
.sized, in that the organization never-
recommends a man for dismissal from
the army, but simply conducts investir
gations, omitting any application.

NEXT PROBﬁElM To SAVE
WORLD FROM DEMOCRACY

Says Germany Deserves Stern
Punishment s Fears America
IS Softening. '

Despite the quarantine of the S. A.
T C. and the general tear of expos—
,urc to the “tin", a considerable crowd
nus present in the chapel last night to
lbcar Sir John Foster Fraser give his
lecture on “The Checker-board 01 Eur
Liane."

In a very clear and entertaining way
'Sir Fraser explained the world Situaal
tiou as it is today and took up one by
one some or the problems which must
be faced in the reconstruction

First of all he spoke ot the Balkan
Aploblem. “\‘atlnllallly there," ire said,

 

to catch the ﬁfteen men who were Boxing the Favori—te Pastime at‘nis not decided by race or langua a,
S

but by r.elrgrou Self determination
there wrll moon that they will soon fly
at each other's throats again. The
only solution is new boundary lines
h'scd on race with freedom of relig—
ion.”

Real Russia Democratic.

“Russia is another great problem but
not so difficult if understood. The
real RI sia is the most democratic
country in the world. patriotism there
is akin to religion itself. They fought
for Holy Russia as well as the Czar.
No other country furnished a battalion
of death. But the Russians as a na-
tion lack continuity or will power.
Thcir- philosophy is ’never mind’, a
philosophy which will inevitably re»
lard their progress. So what Russia
needs in these black hours is not criti—
cism but sympathy and understanding,
especially from the U. S. whom she
has conﬁdently set up as her model."

or Italy he said: “We joy in the
triumph which the Italians have bad.
ltaly has gloriously redeemed lrerselt.
Little Belgium, too, is being restored
unto herself. To France not only we
01 this generation, but those 0! tuture
generations unborn owe a debt that
can never be paid. But it isn't for
any one to say that this country did
better than another. '. Each one did its
b'est for its own welfare and that of
the larger cause."

Great liritain Bears 76% Casualties.

The real test in this war has been
suffering. Great Britain’s share then
is only too forcibly'revealed in his
statement that during the last year of
the war she has had more casualties
than all the other allies put together
England herself has borne 76% of the
total casualties of her empire.

“The war has now come to a termi.
nation almost like a snap," he said.
"Bulgaria went out of the war. Tur—
key has gone out, and yesterday the
British fleet anchor-ed oil Constanti—
nople. The day is not far off when
the Turk will be moved out of Eu~
rope. The great ramshackle empire
ol Austria no longer c ists. Poland is
coming into existence as also the
Checho-Slovaks, and all the small noo—
ples are seeking Selivdetel'lnination.
One or the great problems awaiting
the statesmen or the world is not only
to help these small provinces in their
efforts at self—determination but .to
help them to appreciate the claims of
other peoples."

Turmoil in Central Countries.

"We are now trying as best we can
to_ bring about an abiding peace. But
we are now witnessing another trag-
odyatllrmoll throughout the central
countries. Something lige mob rul'c
may gain the mastery in Germany. But
it,is necessary that a stable govern—
ment be established there if the world
