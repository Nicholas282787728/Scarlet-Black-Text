Supposed College Student Makes
Way With Hundred Dollars
From Local Stores.

After depositing bogus checks in
two local banks, 41: reputable looking
young man who represented himself
to he Alfred Evans of State Center. it
new college student, succeeded in
inv-iegling local merchants out of
about one hundred dollars ln a few
hours last Saturday morning.

and the Merchants National Banks
he received 530 from the Savings bank
and 525 from gale Mel-chants hank,
together with hlank check books. Are
ter buying a $6 pair of shoes from the
Grinnell Shoe Company, a $34 over-
coat (mm the MoMurray Clothing
Company, and getting an eighty cent
lunch and change from a $5 check

Later in the day Mr. D. M. Arnold,
oi the Grinnell Shoe Company. SuS-‘in
pccting that all was not as it should
he. got in touch with local bank of»
iicials who in turn wired the state
Center bank, which denied that Mr.
Evans had an account in thcir insth
tution.

Altogether the swindler. who was a
serious looking young man of about
twenty. well dressed. and fitting his
part cleverly. got away with about
a hundred dollars. leaving local mel'r
chants sadder and wiser. If new
studcnts have difficulty in having
thcir chechs honorcd at local husiness
establishments. they may thank this
lellow for their diiticulty.
