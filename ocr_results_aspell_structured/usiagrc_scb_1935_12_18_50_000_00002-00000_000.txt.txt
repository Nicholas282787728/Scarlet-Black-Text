LEGITI'MATE STAGE ADVANCES

With the marked success of the Globe
players who have recently presented Shake-
spcarian plays through out the lniddlerlvest;
with the success of the recent production of
“Romeo and Juliet” at the Shrine auditorium
ill Des Moines; and with the splendid produc»
tioll of Sidney Howard’s play, “The Silver
Cord,” by our own department of drama, it
would be well for us to recognize the present
trend towards better drama through out the
DﬁddleAVeSlC.

The taste of the theatre-going public is
under goings. radical change. Middlerwesternv
ers are no longer satisfied with only screen
productions and radio plays. They are den‘lflndr
ing the real thing. They are demanding 'thc
legitimate stage.

The audience of 4500 persons who gath-
cred ill Des Moines from 90 of Iowa’s-99 coun-
ties and from several neighboring states to see
Katherine Cornell ill “Romeo and Juliet”
should mean a great deal. It is evidence that
the middlem stern public is demanding good
stage productions.

The splendid response of. Grillnell students
to the “Silver Col-d”, which was made possible
for them through the cooperation of the Stuv
dent Council and the department of drama,
should mean a great deal. It is ddditional
evidence that this middle-western trend towards
the legitimate stage is present on our campus.

, These organizations are to he, collgrfltllldtcd
for recognizing the present trends toward
drama and for furthering the movement on our
campus hy making it possible for all students
to see really worthwhile college dramatic pl‘o-
ducticns.

Letters to Readers

Dear Editor,
Scarlet. and Black,
The Editor

I want to express my enthusiasm over the
splendid work done in producing “The Silver Cord."
The direction, stsglng and acting were unusually
fine. It must have taken courage to select this type
of play ,and reel talent in portraying such a dell-
Cate social theme.

The psychology of the play was scientifically
sound, and therefore profoundly signiﬁcant. No
Havelock Ellis. The play would have done justice to

doubt the author was influenced by Freud and
an Ibsen.

There is no denying the fact that Cnslaving
emotional attachment to one's parents may lcnd tc
disastmus social maladjustmellts. The illdlvidual is
bound with a subtle “silver cord" \vhlcll prevents
him Irom living freely, from bcmg on his own, from
mcklng desirable and successful contacts. The bane»
ful influence of parental fixation ls evident in col-
lege,‘ where students, usually in their first year, find
themselves yearning to gp home every week-end and
at every opportunity. A home offers security. It air
so offers the protection of childhood from which the
student must break away lf he is to become mature
and independent.

But. this is no vahcl lesson to condemn famlly
ties, to wholly deny the value of mother love. A rec
cent dlecry in psychology asserts that maternal sf
fectlcn, expressed in kisses and caresses and sollc
tulle, is necessary for the healthy, normal gmwlh of
the child. Children ralsed outsule the home, either by
the state or m orphan homes, often grow up with
an abnormal emotional development. Love is the
fruitful soil m whlcll the flowerlng bud of childhood
grows to full bloom.

What is the answer to the problem presented in

in the enlightenment. of parents to the how and why
of rearing Children. Love lntcrfused wlth lbLelll-
gent understanding is the essence of true parent-
hood. Selflsbness springs from greed, but ls £054
tereu by ignorance. Mrs. Phelps, in the play, mlght
not have been such a devastating lnfluencc had she
fully realized the consequences of her allrabsorhing
affection. '
The drama. department merits the full appreclar
Lion of the community for making possible at Grin—
nell such a work of art and liberal education as "The
Silver Cor , -
Sincerely,
Manuel Brown

Other Opinions

THE GIFT on THE GIVEK
(Donne Owl)

“The gift without the giver is bare." There is
an eternal rush to llfe that pushes us on and on—
fsr beyond our own imaginative expectations. We
have so much fun going places and experiencing
tnfles that We never pause to think of the unknown
graces that we pass up or let fall in this race we
are running. We enter all sorts of activities; we
are present at every social function; We all want to
be the whipped cream on top of the baked apple#
but as for doing little things, like smiling when
some one irritates us or talking to the lone girl in‘
the parlor, or telling a. chapel speaker that We en-
joyed his talkithese things we haven't much time
for; people would say we were hypocrites or apple
polishers anyway, so why botherl

why bother? Why, because any little act or
Word that makes life happier for even one person is
worth bothering about.

There is grave danger in our airplanlng about
and that is that with speed we often lose slncerlty.
Ouralives become a superficial cloak of efficiency!
we live to impress. We glve gifts because it is the
thing to do; it makes us “keen," “lovely," ”adore
able," and “snotzy,” And because we don't have
tlmc, we ask someone elsg to do our gift shopping
for us. “on, any little thing, just so you don’t go
over a dollar."

Gifts should mean either a desire to Ming nap
plness to a person becsuse we love that individual
or they mlght express appreciation for some qual-
ity of character present in another but transmitted
to us through assoclctlcn. A gift should fit the re-
ciplent. It may be a material present; it may be
an encouraging conversation: it may be just an em
llvcncd pet on the shoulder, But, whatever the gift,
there must be behind it and supportl g it a sincere
giver;for "A gift without a giver is bareAWho

,glvcs hlmselt vu’th his alms feeds three: himself, his

hungerlng neighbor, and Me."
