POOL HALL

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

By MAX ROSS

The reaction of the Pioneer fool:
hall team to the heartbreaking de-
feat at the hands of Creighton yes-
terday needs no explanation, but
without any attempt at more coir, l-
ing, it can be said that their exhibir
tion against the crack Blllejay outs
fit was one of the best seen on the
local field for some time, Coach Watt,
Captain Graflund, and his men have
nothing to feel bad about after the'
splendid showman

5- a s
Although their long string of un-
defeated contests on “'ilrd ticld has
been broken, the Pioneers had a
strange trick of fate played ,upon
them, since their caliber of football
against Creighton in defeat was bet»
ter than in any of the games on the
schedule in their four years of susA
tinned \ietory.

x 2 a
It was a wonderful sight to see
Grinnell's “thin red line" resist the
charges of Cornie Collin, the Blue
jays AlIrAn-lerlcan candidate, Creigh-
ton was outplayed, even though only
by a slight margin, but bad the
breaks been with the Grinncll team.
the score would probably have been
reversed.

e r »
The best play of the day came
when nick ullrich pulled a quick kick
over CoIIilI‘s head in the last quarter.
The ball was put in play on Grinllell's
1&de line, the Ide soiled over
Collin’s head, and as the latter stood
in his triads watching the boil, it

 

came to rest in the very corner of the
field where it was downed by McKee
on the 2-ynrd line. It was only one
of 1| number of good punts, but it was
the most spectacular play of the
panic.

Creighton pulled a good bit of
strategy at the end of the first quar-
ter With the ball inside their own {he-
yard line. The Bluejays rushed the

~ ball for two plays, keeping it in their

possession until the quarter ended.
The two teams then changed sides,
and Collin, now with the Wind at his
back, punted out of danger

a a k

Frank Duncan was harder hit by
old Lady Luck than any of them, for
it .was he who dropped it touchdown
pass on the goal line in the last min~
ute of play. The lanky and is not to
be blamed in the slightest, tllongh,
because the slippery boil, the icy grid.

Duncan continued his excellent
work displayed in the Drake game.
He caught the "spot" pass from
Clark on the play which gave Grim
bell its touchdown in thelt'ourth
quarter. In addition, he made several
nice tackles, once breaking through
the entire Bluejay interinrenee to
smear Collin for a 10ryard loss.
