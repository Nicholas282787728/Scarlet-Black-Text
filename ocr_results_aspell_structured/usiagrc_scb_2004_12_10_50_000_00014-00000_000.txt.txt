Exploring Grinnell's calendar

According to the November 19, 2004 stab, a student
initiative asked for the addition of one or two additional
bulier days at the end ofa semester, Currently, sanirday
and Sunday sene as bulfers, so the proposal would be to
increase this number to 3 or 4.

The S83 article stated, “many or Grinnell College's
peer institutions ofhighcr learning already have at least one
day or an entire week as a reading period prior to exams.
including Carleton College, Wesleyan University, Duke
University, smith College, i—larmrd College, Amherst
College, Yale University Williams College, swarthmore
College and Bowdoin College among others."(S&iB, No-
vember 19,2004, p. 3)

While in this note I do not take a position on this prior
posal, it is important that the entire academic calendar be
considered as a whole. What follows are seveml observa—
tions regarding the semester calendars for rhe fall semester
2004 from each of the schools listed in the 5&3 article.

‘ Grinnell and Duke are the only schools on the
list with 14 weeks of classes (plus exams). Five have 13
weeks ofclisscs, and the remaining four have less than 13
weeks. (Carleton is on the quarter system and its ﬁll quarr
ter contains only 9.4 weeks of classes.)

~ Comparing Grinnell and Duke (with 14 weeks of
classes, plus otams), Duke has a fall break on days, rather
than a week. Both Grinnell and Duke have 2 weekdays
oﬂffor Thanksgiving.

‘ Only Swarthmore and Grinnell have a full week
break in die fall, in addinou to Thanksgiring. only Grin-
nell,Amhcrst, Swanhmorc and Bowdoin have 7 wcckdays
of holidays/break during classes (before the exam sched
ule); no schools have more; seven schools have fewer days
(ranging from o to 1).

" Contrary to the daim in the sons, swanlrmore,
Carleton, Amherst, and Grinnell have exactly the same
number orbulrer days (2), although the butter days for the
other schools are not weekends.

* Frye schools have more holidays (breaks during
classes, buffer days) than Grinnell:

'Weslcyan (10 holidays) has a May niidesemesrer
break within a 137week semester and shifts their entire
schedule about 1 week later (ending December 22).

* Harvard (29 holidays) has only 12.4 weeks of
classes and teams are in January, beginning 24 days after
classes end.

‘ Yale (12 holidays) has 12.6 weeks of classes.

’ Williams (10 holidays) has 12.2 weeks of classes.

' Bowdoin (11 holidays) has Zone-day holidays and
1 twtrday break during classes and a 134vcek semester

“The exam periods for several of these sd-tools ins
dude weekends; some schools give exams on Saturdays
and Sundays.

These notes do not argue for a Change in Grinnell‘s
weelq for example, Grinncll could choose to have Exams
Tuesday through Friday rather than Monday through Frie
day. This would add a hulrer day wiLhout changing the
OVCrrtll sdicdule.

Similarly these notes do not argue that Grinnell
should have 14 weeks of classes, although traditionally
mat has been viewed as pronding the time required for
appropriate coverage ofneeded material.

Also, (host: notes do not argue rlrar holidays should
not be shifted from holidays during a semester to butter
days. For example, following the Glinnell calendar from
rhe 1970s, classes could meet the day arter'l'hanksgiviug.
This would allow the addition ofan om buli’er day while
maintaining 14 weeks ofclasscs, Similarly, Gi'iiincl] could
consider abolishing the week-long break in October in {re
Vor orbulrer days.

All college calendars ninction within overall goals,
involving class timc, breaks, and exams, Ofcoursc, more
time can be allocated at one place, but this requires cithcr
lengthening the semester or taking time from somewhere
else. Since time is inelastic, one cannot add butter days
without taking some other actionThc basic issue is what
balance works best.

SCIPE does what?

We've always wondered what it was that the student
group SCIPE acruaily did. It seems to make a big deal
out of itself but we've never actually realized the point of
its existence \Vnﬂt least until a recent issue of the Gone
zit/l Htl’ﬂ/dtngim‘Vr In diet issuc, we saw SCIPE's leadn
and animating spirit, Eli Zigas, praise rhe uluafonscrvar
tive, homophobe, State Rep Danny Carroll for showing
integrity uncommon among public oﬂicials as a result of
his recent “apology" for a piece of literature that implied
Grinnell students did not have the right to yotc in Iowa.
in this sovcalled apology, Carroll apologized only because
there actually are not “1,000 east coast liberals"at Grinnell
rather than for rhe implication that Grinnell students are
secondeclass citizens, Apparcndy, Carroll's integrity con-
sists ofa promise that, in the iimrrc, he will more accurate-
ly count rhe number ofpeople who don't deserve rhc right
to vote. We are frightened at the moral blindness that this
implies, praising an extremist who has shown a continual
disregard for the nindanrenral civil righrs ofGrinnell stu-
dents, Unfortunately, this is only part ofpancm ofSCIPE,
in their attempts to “boost political awareness."

In late October, they held a debate between Danny
Carroll and his opponent, Eric Palmer on the issue orgay
man-iage, a topic that was not prcia‘ously an issue in that
state house race, or virtually any other state house race
in the state. Although it may be a relevant issue fsderr
ally, it ignored the issues that were at stake in 75th House
District like the Iowa Values Fund. property taxes and
sdiool district oonsolidarion. By ensuring the fact that
Eric Palmer believes in civil rights for all Americans was
publicized rluough rural, socially consermriye parts of the
75th House District. the dcbatc made certain that Danny
Carroll was reelected by a slim margin on Election Day
Thanks to this, Carroll can now spend two more years
promoting his ulna right—wing, atemist agenda in Des
Moines. It’s good to know that SCIPE has ﬁnally done
something and made tr dilrcreuce,
