“His'liujcsi Dunkcl' Beau " drain .
tized from Mar Leon Wilson' tar
eal hooh which will he pi sentetl hi
the 0hr to-lallis litei ir societies I
the Colonial theater F do, eieniiis,
A1)! 19 i a study in the ps eholeey

‘ it is a memorable and

not; development or "A5 a man
Ulinkcth.”

The liooh. which s a deiigllltnl cml-
li'ibutiun to . we on literature, h'lS
been tuined into a supcrn izti, wot a-
day, laughable comedy which ever) one
who ends it will want to see. And
the “Bunker Bean" enthusiast u l be
amused by the play even if no is not
,eonipletely satisﬁed.

i'ilzll‘)‘ Robbi s .. The Flapper

1n the impersonation ot The Flapper,
Miss \lzu'y Robbins has a real oppo .
tuuit tor aetine. Grandma the D .
men; the gloatcst pitcher the world
has ercr lotoun; the blatant Bulger:
the u ey Billthazztl'idil have stepped
lile»iiko and welcome iroin the pages
of the book. ,

Those who laughtcd immoderatcly
at \Vilsoll's story of Bunker Bean and
reread it several times, u l tind that
the dramatization [allows the book
with surprising and easy ﬁdelity and
tells enough ot the story of a cowed
and eredulous youth, Eunkoi Bean
(Andlew Hunter”, who became l '11eg
when he has tr lwd into believing
himself the reinear ation of Napoleon,
a blood-thirsty Doge, and an Egyptian
king of the prcdynastie era.

lilopes With The Flapper

This deli n of grandeur lasts long
enough for him to date everyone, make
a fortune on the stock market and
elope \ tli The Flapper. And even
tho his dream came to an end it had
lasted long enough ior him to realize
that whereas he was nothing but
George Upstart, that was all one had
to be to get along in this world of
bluff.
