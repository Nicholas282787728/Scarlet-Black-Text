Administration considers buffer days proposal:
Need to reduce academic pressure emphasized

by Catherine Ingrassia

.\ii derision this been made yet. but the
Cuiiiiiiittee on Academic Standing
tC.A 5,) reviewed the proposal submitted
by the student Committee for Butler Days
iOct.15,1982 5&8). In a meeting last Tues»
day, the committee discussed the proposal
inrormally and planned lurthcr discussion
of the issue at their Nov. 9 meeting.

Until then, a subcommittee headed by
Professors Herman and Haas will in»
vestigate the present academic situation
at the end of a semester in terms of the ac-
tual amount of work required. They will
poll the faculty to determine the number of
finals given in comparison to the number
of take-home exams.

Because the biggest obstacle to obtain»
ing additional buffer days is reluctance to
change the present calendar, which olnits
buffer days, the GAS. is looking for other
ways to ease the academic pressure found
at the end of the semester.

Among the alternative proposed are the
addition of a “dead week "stipulating that
professors cannot assign papers or exams
due the last week of the semester, ProV

lessor Lalonde noted, "If all papers were
required two weeks before the end of the
semester, the end or the term might be
made less worrisome."

Dean Frazer said she would like to see
"earlier feedback to students about each
class as'to whether they are passing or
not," Such a progress report could be
helpiul and important to some students by
giving them a better sense of academic
direction. Similar policies have been sues
cessl’ul at other collegﬁ, according to
Frazer.

Furthermore, Frazer said that the C.A.S.
is working for a more optimum use of the
exam schedule. Presently the finals for
less popular class times are put right at
the beginning of the week, while the more
popular slots are at the end. A further stag-
gering oi exams could help lessen the
burden, although, Frazer noted, "There is
no miracle cure."

Frazer and the C.A.S. seem to be in
favor oi taking some steps to ease the
academic pressure. However, not all

For the third ,, tr. in a row. discussion
at Wednesday nights Joint Board meeting
centered on the recently adopted by-law
change which prevents voting on new
business motions not included in the agen-
da. The author of the by-law, James Hall
President Matt Golden, asked JB to zip
prove an amendment to the by-law which
would further require SGA to post the at
tual text oi new business motions for mm.
sideration.

Golden pointed out that the amendment.
which changes only olie word or the by-
law, merely represents a Clarification of
its intent and does not change the meaning
of the original proposal.

While most Joint Board members ex7
pressed support tor the amendment.
several representatives questioned its
validity in the speciﬁc case of an son letr
ter to the campus community. They
argued that it is ridiculous to iirst include
the letter with the agenda, then vote on it
and then republish it. \

Countering this argument, CSL mcmhcr
Steve Berkson maintained, “Students
have a right to see anything discussed by
this body.” When members added that, in
such cases, one hyrlaw could easily be
suspended, Berkson cautioned against exr
cessive use of rulesiispension stating that.
“If (the motion) is not pressing, the rules
shouldn't be suspended." Golden added
that suspending the rules is an “incredibly

slimy maneuver.” _
, Discussionsoon ended, and the motion

’ was passed. Because it is a bylaw amend-
ment, JB approval will be required at next

week's meeting before it comes into effect,
Golden then made two new business mo-
tions concerning funding for the “James
Hall Bachanal." The first request was for
$65 to be used for publicity, The second
was tor $60 to purchase T»shli‘ts for hall
residents working at the party. Golden ex-
plained that he had been forced to bring
the requests belore Joint Board due to a
cancelled Finance Committee meeting.

Vern Juel. Finance Committee chain
man, expressed his reluctance to approve
the request because the application ror
funds was filed at. the last minute and the
outlay for Tshirts would “set a precedent
of compensating people for working at par
ties " He added that. James Hall has suffi
cient liall funds to cover these expenses unr
ill the) can be considered by the Finance
Committee,

Reinforcing Juel's argument, SGA Vice»
President Mark Bradshaw informed JB
that the funding application was not lully
completed before its submission,

The ensuing discussion focused on the
issue of paying students who work at par-
ties,

Because Golden's motions were not in»
cluded in the agenda, JB was forced to sus-
pend thc by-law change in order to vote on
it The request for publicity iunds was ap
proved, but the Tshirt money was not
allotted.

in other business, Bradshaw and Social
Coordinator Allison Paich informed JB
that all of the 11 applicants had been
chosen to work on the security nice. They
explained their selection was based on the

laculty members believe unanimous stu-
dent support ior butter days exists.
Lalonde said, “Many students whom i
know and speak to do not give me the im»
pression that this is the burning issue of
their time.”

Dan Nissenbaum, a member of the stu-
dent Committee for Buffer Days, em-
phasized “the need to focus attention on
the time constraints and die large amount
of work that builds up at the end of the
semester."

Through the proposal the committee
hopes to start some sort of process at
negotiation that would result in more time
to study through either additional buffer
time and/or other alternatives to ease
academic pressure.

The committee encourages students to
speak with their professors and EPC
representatives to make their feelings, on
this issue knoivn.

Generally the administration recognizes
that the academic pressure does exist, but
it does not concede that one extra day

applicants’ responses to questions regar~
ding hypothetical emergency situations.

JB members were quick to express their
dissatisfaction with the selection process
Several members stated that the small
number of applicants iorced the selection
committee to accept all who applied
regardless of their competency. Respon-
ding to this accusation, Bradshaw main-
tained that they “did have a choice"
because any unsatislaotory applicant
would not have been hired despite the shore
tage of security people,

Specific questions were raised by other
members as to the committee's knowledge
or the behavioral record of the applicants.
Finally, it. was noted that no JB represenr
tative was present during the interviews
as had been planned. Bradshaw apologized
for the oversight, but Younker Hall m.
President Mike Cameron maintained that
his apology did not make the committee
decision any more valid stating, “The in
terviewing process was not what JB asked
it to be. I‘m not sure if this is legitimate.”

The linal arguments centered on the [act
that the selected students were notpresent
at the meeting for questioning. crctchen
Fisher, Gates Hall president. stated, "I
don't understand the point of us approving
them when we don't know them.” Hailles
president Pete Hautzinger expanded on
this idea saying.
“I kind or ice] like we’re being cir-
cumvented here. . . i think we should vote
no and start over." Finally, Cowles l-laii
president Steve Lisco moved to postpone
the approval or security guards until they
are able to appear before JB He aided that
those students already selected should be
allowed to work at campus parties in the
interim, Havmg already suspended the
new business byrlaw to allow tor a decision

would make a great difference. President
Drake feels that the present calendar is
“pretty good" and believes, “An extra
day is not the most vital thing.” .

Differences between students' in—
dividual study habits obviously exist and
nothing can be done about that. in light of
this, Frazer thinks that “It's more useful
to ease academic pressure than to add one
more day. You‘d run into Peterson's law —
you can add one or two or three more days
7 there's no perfect number."

In addition, Frazer admitted to the ad-
ministration‘s reluctance “to start Chang»
ing the calendar because we have looked
at the permutations; one change starts a
chain reaction."

Ultimately the decision lies with the
faculty. Frazer feels that it is impossible to
predict their response to either butter days
per se, or to the other alternatives offered.
Formal discussron will begin on Nov. 9 and
culminate in a recommendation to the
faculty on November 15 or in early
December.

ment. The motion passed by one vote,

Represenkiltive Michaelene Kelly then
presented a letter regarding a change in
the P/F deadline to a later date in the
semester than the present one. While
members were in tavor of endorsing the
letter and were prepared to approve it.
Read Hall President Vic Rudolph pointed
out. "It doesn't matter when it's passed
ithis semester's P/F date has come and
gone) . . .we might as well try to submit
the best piece of prose possible."

Berkson dien suggested the forma-
llon of an ad hoc committee to work on the
letter. JB approved his suggestion over-
whelmingly

In other business, Juel announced that
the open Finance Committee meeting to
discuss the expenditure of the SGA reserve
surplus has been changed to next Thurs-
day at 7:30 pm, in ARH ii.
