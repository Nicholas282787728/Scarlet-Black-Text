1s Gl-inneligcing to allow compul»
sory chapel to become a lecture of our
college me? After many years or
voluntary attendance shall the school
have to employ stricter measures to
secure the proper interest in this
exercise? we remember not long ago
when 2i Student either Went to chapel
or irept oil the campus, But are
the upper classmeh doing their duty?
Du the old sLudean have Enough
reverence for the traditions to properly

The upper classmen can do much to
make the chapel service when it ought.

Thesuggesbion made by President, '

iiain that it might be well to change
the chapel hour to twelve o’clock has
not met with much iavor among the
students. The prevailing sentiment
seemsto favor the present hour, One
argument adranced is that there are
more people on the campus irorn eight
till teu o‘clock than during any other
part oithe day. Agilitthat the real
purpose oi the service would be lost
wmlrg at the close oi the days work
rather than at the beginning. it has
beensuggested that the library should
not. be opened till after chapel except,
icrolasses and kept opened till ten
o’clock in the evening, It seems to
us that this is a matter to be settled
among the classes to discourage and
discountenance . the use oi college
buildings for any purpose whatsoever
during the chapel hour With the
united action oi the classes a senti-
ment would soon grow which would
