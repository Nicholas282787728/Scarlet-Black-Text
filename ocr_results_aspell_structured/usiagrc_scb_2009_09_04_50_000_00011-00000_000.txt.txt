I did to get here

Students who put the journey before the destination

BYJUMI BELLo ,,

It often takes a lot of time and work to
get to nowherHspcclally to a towh like
Grinncll. sometimes the drive is so long or rho
layover so intense that when it is over you find
yourseltstnring up at he JRC asking, “How the
fuck did I get here?"

Gtinnellians come from all over the world
and somehow manage to converge in a town of
nine thousand where it can seem to some that
the closest taste of mainstream Civilization is a
mega-Walmarr and the wildest thing you can
do is drunkenly attempt to ride the tractors
next to Noyce late at night. Many Grinnellians
sometimes just need to get the F‘k out of here
at all costs. Bur some are going to get the (“It
out with style. Some just have a taste for the
quest.

Last year, Eric Ritter '12 spontaneously
planned and spent six days in his heat-up, eighe
teen-year»old white Camry driving to campus
for N80 from his home in Connecticut. “1 just
knew that i wanted to drive to
school crossecountry, I’ve al—
ways wanted to do that," said
Ritter. “Even though it’s only
halt the country, I knew that
I'd make an adventure out of
it.”

And Ritter did. The ﬁrst
stop on his journey was a K-
mart patking lot. Driving
down 1—80, Ritter spotted the thousand-car
parking lot and, becoming curious, pulled over
to observe the people walking in and out of
the store. He decided right on the spot to learn
about them. He put on a pair of sunglasses,
a clean shirt, stood at the store entrance and
asked people about their Lives. He claimed he
was a representative from a websire that he
made up: mydailylife.com (which, unknown to
Ritter, is a run-of—the-mill biog).

Ritter particularly remembers one elderly
couple. “This couple said, ‘every other Sunday,
we go to Kamatt. We live thirtyrﬁve miles
away and it’s the highlight otour weeklmlzitter

was over.”

”Ir died in Ihesnow/n a// its
glory at 70 mph. / knew it

Beanagman '08

said. “I remember thinking to myself that there
are definitely better things in life than having
Krmart be a hisweekly highlight ofexlstence.”

After leaving Kemart, Rirter stopped in a
small town to look for a thrift store, only to
ﬁnd rhar the only convenience store in town
had been attacked by wild boars. Ritter said
that a woman told him “for some reason, they
were attracted. A herd of about 15 went into
the store.went cmzy and then ran out."'

On the last leg of his journey, Ritter
stopped in Indiana to purchase some ﬁfe’
works, illegal in his home state, and set them
off outside his car, not really knowing what he
was doing. “I watched them alone, sort ofgig-
gling to myself,” Ritter said.

While Ritter arrived in Grinnell in the
spirit of Jack Kerouac, Nic Wilson ’12 decided
to take on a different set of hot wheels when
he biked home to Minneapolis for fall break
last year. “it seemed really ridiculous, some
rhing really impossible," Wilson said. “I've

never done anything like
that. It was something like
300 miles." But Wilson
did it. Prior to leaving, he
read up on the necessities
of longrtetm hiking and
bought the equipment for
it, along with some camps
iug gear.

Wilson slept for two
nights in state parks in his hammock rent.
One of the places he stayed at was a park
called Beaver Creek, right near Patkersville,
IA, where Wilson ended up eating a meager
dinner of cheese and crackers at a gas station.
After three long days of biking, Wilson ﬁnally
made it home. “By the time I got into Min’
neapolis that day. it was dark and I had been
on the bike for ten hours. I was pretty much
hallucinating."

Despite his hallucinations,Wilson couldn’t
help but insist on the point ofrhe comfort that
being alone on this trip brought him. “Today,
you’re never really alone. You have to try. You

time, I was. I’d be on state highways, county
highways, so thered be hardly any rmtac. so
I’d be completely alone on my bike for eight
to ten hours a day . . .which was really nice."

While Ritter and Wilson took one-way
journeys on the road, Benj Wagman ’08 went
there and back again Samwise Gamgee style.
"it was really just let’s get out of here for the
weekend and go have some fun," said Wagman
of the trip he and Sean Miller ’08 attempted to
take to Columbia, Missouri during December
of their freshman year.

The third and most important member of
their guild was the “red and rusty" 1988 Toyota
Celica GT stick shift Wagman had received
from his uncle for his sixteenth birthday. “It
had all kinds of problems, It wasn’t weather—
proof, but it was very charming," said Wagman,
who also requested that the car he referred to
as “weathered" and “determined” rather than
“shitty."

Wagman’s hometown, warned that the car
wouldn't make it back from Iowa alive. “He
was totally prophetic," Wagman said. True to
the mechanics words, just outside of Macon,
Missouri, the determined little car “died in the
snow, in all its glory, at 70 mph," said Wagman.
”I knew it was over." -

With a busted car, Wagman and Miller
found a pay phone, called a tow truck, and
ended up trading in the teenaged vehicle for
80 dollars in cash. Sitting in a McDonald’s
with rhe car stereo and all their possessions
wrapped up in a blanket, they decided to do
what any “dudes" would do in their position.
“I spent that 80 bucks on beer and bowling,"
said Wagman.

After their “fuck it, let’s go bowling”week-
end, they ended up wending their way back to
Grinnell, through the generous rides of both
strangers and distant acquaintances to whom
he is forever grateful. “And that was that,"

Wagman said. “My car ms gone but it was a
really fun weekend.”
