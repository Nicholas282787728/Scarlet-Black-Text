Jayson \Nright's '09 MAP, “The Ties That
Bind," explores issues ofsexuallty, shame, and ill-
ness as well as those of compassion, strength and
love. Co-dirccted with Caitlin Davies. the show
debuted last night and will run through Sunday.

In a series orthrce vignettes. Wright collects
the histoly of gay relationships around love, one
fering and compassion. This lirst piece, entitled
“Voices in Time," follows gay issues rrom the
late sixties to a possible tiiture.Tlie second piece,
“Summer Qiartet.” oxploles the loss and fear
betwccn four friends, one ofwhom has been di»
agnosed with HIV. The play develops this focus
on the intel'rrelarional repercussions of HIV in
the ﬁnal section,“Looking Back,"ehroniehng the
story of two lovers living with HIV.

The characters flush from anger to sup
port, from devastation to love, and have already
changed the perspectives ofthc actors themselves.

- “These type of things are so easy to push
away but tapping into the sense of total loss
completely changes your perspective," Kevin Tru-
del'12 said. deel plays Vince, the best friend of
an HIV victim,

“Ties That Bind" also pays homage to the
fortitude and strength of love,between same sex
partners or otherwise.

“We did a lot of improv exercises . .s to estab
lish friendships and connections between actors,”
Wright said.

“I broke down quite a bit in rehearsal,” Lexy
Leuszler ’12 (Julia) said. "I think the hardest was
playing those improv games and talking about an
emotion as diﬂicult as griefand absolute loss"

In addition to forging bonds over shared
hardships, the actors welc asked to build a back
story around the first time a fellow character got
drunk and other hilarious “past monienrs.”The
effect is an onstage closeness is M ballemble as
it is devastating.

Despite its focus on the repercussions of the
AIDS epidemic, the play also promises a degree
of hope in its focus on inter-character relations
ships. The show’s tinal vignette focuses on the
relationship between two men, only one of whom
is HIV positive.

“The ﬁnal piece really brought home the
concept of disease and the reality or living with
it," said Rev Damgh '12, who plays Danny, the
HIV negative partner, “The process really wid-
ened my perspective."

Wright asserts that the piece is intended to
touch the audience in some way, but leaves the
speciﬁc: to the audience. Whether the cumular
ﬁve eﬁ'ect of his three semesters of work is shock,
sadness, empathy or tear, it is most certainly also
a profound awe in the power of human compast
sion.

Millard Fillmore: Old History, New Sound

By Max CALENBERG

Millard Fillmore became President on July
9, 1850, after the death of Zachary Taylor, He
was the last member ofthe Whig party to hold
office and his failed reelection campaign err
suted his now persistent obscurity.

More than 150 years later, Flllmore’s name
and legacy has become an obscule pop culture
and historical reference, which will now enter
the music world thanks to a new band of four
Grinnellians.

Brian cavanagh-strong '09 (keyboard),
Adam Thein ’10 (bass), Natl: Rcdrnan '09
(drums), and Mike Weslander’o‘) (guitar, lead
vocals) formed the band Phineas Gage oyct
fall break as all four met in the basement of
1010 High Street, playing together through»
out the week. After winter break, and some
soul searching, they changed their name to
Millard Fillmore to avoid any confusion with
the ever popular other Phineas Gage, a hard—
core metal band from Watertown, MN.

The guys still meet several times a week
in the same basement they formed in with a
low ceiling and even lower head banging pipes.
They listen to a recording of their live show,
discuss arrangements and practice. Being a
freshly formed band, the members know they

are still growing together.

“I don't know we know what our sound
is yet," said Redman. “We dent know how to
categorize ourselves, and maybe the object is
to not do that."

Initially, the group was, understandably, a
bit short on material

“You know, when we started we played a
lot of covers because we were experimenting
with how we sound," said CavanaglrSttong,
“But as we started writing more music it
seemed pretty uniﬁed, Right now we are in a
stage ofplaying mostly original work but using
our favorite covels to supplement that,"

The songwriting process normally begins
with Weslancler.

“Most of the stuffl write is just on my
acoustic giitar," says Woslander, “I show it to
[everyone] and we’ll change the chords, lyric
passages and melodies, which makes it our
music and not just mine."

Much of their original material sounds like
the sum of their individual inﬂuences, which
range from John Mayer (Weslander) to theatre
music (CavanaghrStrong) to Van Morrison
(Redman) to Rush (Thein), Weslander sings
in a gentle tone, breathing the words out of
his mouth, Brian never allows his upbeat keys

boarding or his voice to get submerged, and all
four commonly join together for rich harmo—

vibetThe sound is friendly while still Contnln’
ing enough energy and variation to make it the
main focus ofa bar scene.

As (or next year, after three members have

MICHELLE FOURNIER

graduated, the group may still be able to get
together to practice and play gigs, as all of
them may remain in low.

That plan reafﬁrms their laid back ap-
proach. Why worry about the long-term out-
look when a quality jam session can happen
right now?
