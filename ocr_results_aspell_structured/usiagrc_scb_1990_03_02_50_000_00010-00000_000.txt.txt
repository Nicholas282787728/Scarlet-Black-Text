an overriding consideration in the
selection of professors, which is
exactly what existing Marxist-
Len‘tnistgovemmentsdo. Theonly
difference between the two is that
under a Marxist-Leninist
government only one ideology is
tolerated. whereas ML Washbum
might permit several ideologies to
be represented. However, this
differenceisnottcn-iblysigniﬁcant;
it is one of degree rather titan kind,
and moreover Mr. Washbum's
program would strictly control the
inﬂuence that each ideology will

future crowded conditions caused
by the closing of several college~

known as “Aqua House," will be

The speciﬁcations for the dorm
are still far in tire future, but Drake
suggested that the dorms capacity
could reach 90 students, He added
that the large number of occupants
wouldenablcthedorrntobedivided
into two residential units, The loca»
tion of the dorm also has not been
decided. but Drake stresses the
probabiltity of a south campus loca-
tion.

The upgrading of Grinnell‘s
computer facilities was also ap-
proved. According to Drake, the
system’s word processing capabili-
ties will be improved, but that this
improvementwillbeatasignificant
cost to the college.

accomplishments of Western
constitutional democracy that he
overlooks is protection from such
intellectual persecution.

Finally, I see no way that ML
Washbum’sproposalcould everbc
put into practice, Universities
would have to determine which
views may be represented on their
campuses and how much each
should be represented by ﬁnding
how widely those views are
acceptedby the general public How
do we find the extent to which a
cenain(verycornplex)bcliefsystem
is represented in the general
population? Bytakirtgan‘ideology
census" every 10years? Moreover,
suppose that a particular view gains
many new adherents among the
current faculty. Would we have to
stop hiring new faculty who accept
tint view (at least until the next
“ideology census”)? 1 don't see
how Mr. Washburn's system can
avoid such absurd consequences.

Caccamo wants his

is incredibly important irt a play of
this nature, because of its aural

ACLU’s positions “mostly
libertarian” is an accurate
description.

Finally. Icomc to ML Berger’s
comment about Kitty Dukakis. l
have nothing against making jokes
about those in the public eye, but
thccommentaboutMs, Dukakis’s
drinking problem was rude, and
insensitive. Alcoholism is a diSCaSC,
a sickness. Laughing at someone
because of it is akin to laughing at
someone who is crippled. “What
do you call a Quadraplegic on the
floor? Matt! Ha ha.” I got sick of
hcaringjokcs like these a long time
ago Thcyjustaren’t funnyt Neither
