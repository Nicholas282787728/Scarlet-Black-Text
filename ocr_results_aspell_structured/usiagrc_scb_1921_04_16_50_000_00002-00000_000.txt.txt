that annually the sophomore class one

as have been its predecessors. For
most of us the other affairs can take
place next year but there will he no

more one large iormul event should

That much at least is necessary.

The expense of this banquet will
not need to be large. When divided
up among the class it will scarcely
be noticed and the whole will not at-
