Small Town Symposium
reflects misplaced

priorities

tomorrow night the college will end
the symposium on Small Town. in
America. After George Drake gicot his
closing remarks the college will finally
turn off their public relations machine
and will open up their chechhoahs and
begin paying the bills for this highly ex-
pensive public relations and marketing
venture. Yet aside from paying the

' bills, the college must honestly tutlt

. itself; was it worth all the money and
more importantly, is this what our cob
lege administrators should be doing
with their time? ‘

During a semester when the college’s
faculty is seriously concerned about the
real loch of time to pursue academic
research and other professional goals,
it seems alrrwu obscene that top of-
ficials in the college’s administration
took enormous amounts of time to pur-
stte what seem to be an expensive and
rather mediocre publicity stunt. While
faculty flee this campus in search .of
more research time and higher
salaries, this college administration has
spent thousands of dollars and hun.
dreds of hours to stage a publicity stunt
that marginally beneﬁts any Crinnell
student.

While Nollelt House has been throw-

« iug a party for American small towns,
this college is struggling to deal with
enormous problems that seoerely
threaten the quality of the education
offered. Although George Drake, Tom
Marshall and Bill Deminoff may think
that Grinnell, Iowa is a great place to

live, crinnell College may not be as
good a place to go to college. Granted
that Tom Wolfe and Hugh Sidey wilt hr.
ing attention to the college, but na-
tional attention will not solve the fact
that this college can‘t hold on to the
quality junior faculty and that many
important and popular departments
are quite under staffed.

There is no doubt that the college
needs to advertise itself and that there
is a need for public relations. And in
fact bringing speakers to campus is a
good way to gain publicity for the col.
lege while offering something educa-
tional to the student body. Yet, it seems
the Small Town symposium is not far
the students, it was purelyfar publicity.
Considering the college administration
scheduled the symposium when it did
(the week before mid-semester ex-
amination) and that there were no
students on the organizing committee,
merely emphasises the point that those
in Nollen House never intended to hold
the Nymposl'um for the student body.

Perhaps this point has been
bolabored too much in the last four
years, but again it appears that with the
small town symposium, this college has
lost sight of its educational foundation»
while seating for publicity.
Although crinncll College may get all
sorts of publicity from this symposium,
we at the college must consider the cost
incurred for such publicity. After all
the hours and dollars spent we may
know more about small towns, but do
we hone a boiler collt-_e?

The Human

Element

by Jim Duncan

Susan Sat down heavily in the wilYgrass,
the spikes poking through her slacks. The
jolt oi pain in her arm squeezed her eyes
until they blurred, There was the sharp
sting of blood and salt on her lips where
She hit down in agony of the moment. She
felt so damn fired. The arm throbbed, and
with every beat there merged a hotstab or

delirium in her temples. Her skull and ,

neck felt battered and weak; her tongue,
like muscular sandpaper, rasped across
razor-split lips. The heat In her feet was
stilling and her ltngernails crawled like
polished beeue backs until only the bi-
planes circled patiently among thc swimr
ming Clouds and blue waves and the
screeching of engines...

She suddenly regained her senses with
the furious heating or wings and the op
pressive stench oi stale, moulting
feathers. She cried aloud as wingtips slapr
ped her face and neck. and she waved her
good arm and clenched list violently. The
scrawny-necked vulture screeched again,
surprised at the suddenly very live corpse.
and fled to the sky,

Her body lell back against the cool jab oi
the tall granite boulder, drained, Through
red eyes shot with veins, Susan saw the sun
dipping in the mountain: 7 maybe a cour
ple of hours of daylight left She had to find
shelter before then.

Susan looked back uphill at where she
had rested, under the tree next to the
boulder, then realized that it wasn’t a
boulder at all! Not until she stood away all.
a distance did ll. become obvious — the
arms, the head, the Wide-flat nose 7 that it
was a statue, roughly carved by primitive
tools, eroded by nature and time. Hope
welled up again This was the place where

the merchant had told them to look, to find
the one who might know whether her hus-,
band, Will, was dead or alive. La Tierra de
Estatuas.

She stumbled downhill, pausing occae
siunally to listen Her arm [winged again
and she winced, The music had started up
soon alter Susan’s discovery of the statue.
Mournful, the notes floated and swelled
upon the upsweeping valley airs, the moist
tendrils of warmth that lingered in stroke
her bare, bruised arms, limp hair, and
slashed cheeks. She breathed deep of its
vitality, and of the voice of the reed flute.
It whispered a whim of comfort, of a
downy bed and of a steaming pepperoni
pizza to strangle the gnawing, twisting
creatures in her stomach. Its murmur
spoke to her of sorrow and loss of identity
and loneliness And it beckoned her deeper
intothe lushness oi the virile jungle.

Susan swept aside the fronds and
cautiously stepped into the sloping
meadow where a statue, similar to the one
she found earlier. stood erect under the
shielding arms or a gery-bark guernovana
tree. She could see the feet of the flute
player sticking out from behind the statue.
The song was slow; each note held and
mingled with the others to mold together
the sense 0f the jungle and the past, and
the solidness of the poised statue, and the
knee-buckling weakness of the body, and
the ardent hope [or answered questions.
Susan eased toward the statue and circled
around to where the lluteplayer leaned
against the granite. and sank to her knees
belore him. The music stopped as Will
smiled and looked out from under the
broad straw hal. He raised the reed flute to
his llps again. and the new song danced
around both of them.

 

View from the Outside

by Paul Draus

I sit upon the porcelain throne and look
over the latest ramblings of the so-called
“shithouse philosophers." As I shift my
weight back and forth on the cold, hard,
white seat, I ponder the etchings of those
students whose creativity reaches its max-
imum capacity at the same time their
large intestines reach theirs.

I guess that the Burling john is just one
of those crazy aspects of the Grinnell EX-
perience that I haven't gotten around to
enjoying yet, I don’t know. I mean, rd like
to be able to write all over the insides of the
stalls, but lot some reason, every time
nature forces me to leave my books and
head on down to the facilities, I‘m always
in such a hurry that I forget my pen. Silly
me. I guess that’s why I have to settle {or
writing these columns in the newspaper;
it‘s not nearly as convenient, and it’s pron
bably not read by as many people, but us
liberal, well»rounded renaissance Grin-
nellians have to find some way to express
ourselves.

I may start sewing writing utensils in
my undergarments, just to be sure that 1
Lake advantage of my right lreely to
deface college property at least once
before I leave this venerable institution.

But enough about me; I would now like
to pay my respects to those young men and
women who have devoted their time to
making what would normally be a stark
five minutes into a veritable educational
experience,

Flrst at all, I’d like to congratulate the
guy who keeps drawing “Bill the Cat” in
all the different interesting positions in

which I’ve seen him portrayed, I’m sure
Mr. Breathed (Bill's creator) would be
proud ll) see that there are those here at
Grinnell, who are gifted with the same ar-
llSﬁC talent that he has. Nut to mention
originality.

And I'd like to thank the list~makers.
I’ve always wanted to know which women
on this Campus like to bathe in wet nnodles,
or enjoy watching pro wrestling, or who
actually eat those beef and mushroom lur-
novers. I’ll bet the people who are on those
lists wonder why they get strange looks all
the time, too. Oh well, lguess ruining pea-
ple’s reputations is just one at those things
that you can't avoid at a small college.
People will gossip, that’s a tact, and you
can bet they’ll take whatever juicy urtr
substantiated info that col-n5 within ear-
shot and make ll. permanent with indelible
ink all over some public structure if they
get hall a chance, It's just part of the fun.

Then there are those people who write
asking tor inrormatlon. “What do you
know about so and so, has anyone been out
with so and so?” I don’t know about
anybody else, but I'm sure to trust the ad-
vice of someone who scrawls anonymously
on a bathroom wall. I think that's how a lot
of men first hear about their future wives,
isn't iii I see a lot at people writing back,
saying, ”Oh yes, she likes warm, sensitive
men, who know how to express themselves
and treat her with the respect she
deserves. And she makes a hell of a turkey
casserole." What a way to enter a relation
ship Who needs a first date. anyhuw’! Just
read the walls, pal. They’ll tell you all you

need to know.

And Last, but not least, are my favorite
people: the heavy thinkers. some at the
Burling contributors are so articulate that
I wonder why they’re not producing major
works. You know who I mean, they're
always involved in some raging political,
moral, ethical or religious debate which
succeeds in crowding all the young would-
be authors off the wall. Their statements
usually go something like this: “Vietnam
was a blatantly moralistic expression of
capitalist strength for the purpose of furor
ing the blah blah blah..." And then there’s
the one that goes, “The lowest rung in hell
is reserved for these who believe in it out of
fear." Of course, these are poor recrear
lions oi the actual phases used. l guess 1
have a hard time grasping the ideas, much
less remembering them. Anyway, even ill
can't undersiand what they’re talking
about, I have nothing but admiration lor
these toilet paper saints, who choose to use
their bowel movements constructively in
order that we, the Grinnell Student bwdy,
may have a truly well-balanced learning
experience.

But, [must admit, my lavonte anecdote
garnered from the old Burling basement
isn‘l. really very intellectual at all. It’s so
simple that even I can remember it. It's
more of a traditional piece, the kind that
you're just as likely to see in 3 john at the
ball park as in the Grinnell College library.
It goes like this; “I saw you take that shit,
now put. it back."

Now that's a classic
