Gilman, and beyond this turnott,
Route 6 slopes downward in a graceiul
curving arc, At the bottom of the hill
you will pass where an anonymous
political science professor once tried
to murder {our students by rolling
over a Volkswagen they were ri ‘ng
in. B_ut don't dwell on that chilling fact
(the professor is still at large, by the
way), tor you must now cross a small
bridge and begin another long,
yadual climb past Lloyd Durr’s exV
otic animal farm.

At the top of this hill you may en-
counter camels, ostriches, llamas, and
mules. (half pony, half zebra) Mr.
Du‘rr‘used to raise ordinary sheep on
his farm, but decided to turn to more
unusual and unrecognizable animals.
Racing lore contains the tale of the
promising Scots racer, Lewis
Macstuart, dropping out o[ the Tour to
make acquaintance with one of Durr’s
wooley herd.

Further along the road lies a noun
try club, BJ’s Oakroum Restaurant,
and the subdivision of Oakland Acres.
After this, the hills become more pro
nounced and the road swings down,
around and up, past a turnott to Rock
Creek Lake and some home sites. The

next landmark along the Route re»
quires a bit or cycleportaging at the
present time. This is because there is
a bridge out across a stream Whlch
you must traverse by a construction
access road. (A very short hike, I
assure you).

After surmounting this obstacle, the
route takes you up and around some
more hills past the rugged, wooded
slopes of “Sherm’s Hatchery," an ac-
tual cattle ranch that was written up
this summer in the Des Moines
Register.

Soon afterwards, the hills flatten out
into the broad and fertile Skunk River
Valley, and you must cross a bridge
over the mighty Skunk and the Rock
Island railroad tracks before climbing
the hills on the far side and finally
coming in view or Kellogg and another
of Iowa's ubiquitous water towers,

Kellogg is not located directly on
Route 6, but on a northrsouth county
road (T 22). To the north, the road
crosses a set of rolling hills past
Kellogg and eventually runs into E 17,
which goes through Newburg. This
creates a sort of “Kellogg Loop," tak»
ing you back to Grinnell through
Newburg,

To the south, the road goes past an

[-30 interchange, a gravel road that
leads to the college's bio preserve, and
a couple of small towns until it
reaches the turnoff for the somewhat
larger, and more interesting, towns of
Sully and Lynnville.

I must confess that l have not been
along this way for quite a while, huti
do recall that the entire Tour de Lynn-
ville et Sully makes a very substantial
35-40 mile loop, .

Searsboro
Classique

The rlde south on Route 146 to the
town of Searsboro and back is, franks
ly, one of the more uninspiring trips in
the annals of Cycllng. There is often
heavy trarnc between Grinnell and
1-80, there are no hills or notable
sights to speak of until just outside to
Searsboro, and for some reason the
wind seems to blow more unmercifully
than usual along this stretch of 146,

Nevertheless, many tamous racers
have made their names ln the
Searsboro classique, and in tollowing
their route, you do get to see the
Golden Sun Feed tower and the Grin-
nell Mutual Reinsurance Company up
