The Pioneers turned the ball over 23 times
to Knox’s 16, “Decreasing turnovers has been
a goal for us. While 1 feel we are doing better,

"Our main focus this
semester was our three
Midwest Conference
games," explained Coach
David Arsencault. "If we
are able to win one or two
games diis week, our sca-
xon has started off very
well. Even widi the heart-
breaking loss against Knox,
I’m pretty pleased with our
2.1 league record.“

After two weeks ofplay
Grinnell holds a 3-1 over-
all record and is 2r] in the
conference.

In their season opener
the Pioneers downed Mt.
Mercy, 134.123. Last sea-
son they played a barn»
burner at Martin LutherY
prevailing, 141.137, in
overtime. "There is no
qucstion that we're playing
quality opponents this
week," emphasized
Arscneault,

Grinnell had one primary goal for the six
ﬁrst-semester mes, to win its three home con.
ference match-ups. In the three games played
last week, the Pioneers prevailed twice. Mon»

Beloit."

Paramount in the
victorywasGrinnell's
ability to cause 43
Beloit turnovers. In
