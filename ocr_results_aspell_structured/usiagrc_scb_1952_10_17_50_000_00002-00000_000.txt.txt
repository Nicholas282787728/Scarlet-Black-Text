According to Webster

“Boycott” is a transitive verb, meaning . . . “to com—
bine against a pel‘son(s) so as to i . . prevent or hinder
the conduct of his business . . . as a means of punishment
or intimidation." It has nothing to do with boys or cots
although the confusion is quite understandable at this timey
of the year. A

When the Student Council passed a unanimous reso-l
lution to boycott the college laundry and cleaning agencies‘
until they are returned to their old homes in Cowles and
Main, they didn't bother to consult us. We reported the
news and gave it front page space because lve thought it
was a move deserving of such priority. More than two full
weeks have elapsed since that decisive meeting and in that
time the Council has done nothing to follow up its recom~
mendation to the student body.

Every student on the Grinnell campus is represelitedl
at least once on the Student Council‘Since the Council
vote was unanimous it appears that representative studentl
opinion is likewise unanimous. Why, then, are students
still patronizing the college agencies which they have just
legislated against? Why is the student legislative body
sitting back, so impotently‘l

If the students don’t care to back up the Council
in its resolution, it is the duty of each hall and cottage to
instruct its delegate accordingly. That's “hat we have a
Student Council for and that's why this paper bothers to
report the activities of that Council.

Forbid Them N if

Several years ago a tight little group called the Board
of Religion was organized to supervise the religious ac—
tivities on campus.

Meetings were conducted informally; members were
liable to spend whole evenings discussing the personality
of a prospective member. An annual steak fry was indiS<
criminately financed by church funds, and the organiza-
tion was becoming more exclusive and self-satisfied year
by year. The board itself became a “figurehead and a mere
prestige organization, for the actual work was carried on
by the Dean of the Chapel and the faculty advisor.‘

Ollt of nearly 100 applicants last spring, 10 students
were invited to join the board. This, plus the fact that
some of the old members realized their clique was dis-
couraging help from conscientious workers, caused the
board to set up a committee for reorganization.

This committee has already proposed several changes
in policy and attitude, ranging from ushers for Thurs—
day moming chapel to chili suppers in Pine Tree.
Though the basic organization of the board will remain
the same, we feel that this change in attitude is.in itself
a forward step. The assumption that more students want
to work for the board than are now being included will
be proved correct only if the students take the board up
on its new willingness to accept criticism and help.

We hope the board members will find that their pro-
posed program for expansion is justified by the help they
receive from the students.

sitting on the steps smokingmiyi
cigarette. ,

The cigarette was half smokedy
and since there is no smoking
Goodnow hall, he,
must have lighted‘ it outside. Il
met Mr. Lovell waking down
the street in front of the chapel.
There could not have been Sufi
ficient time for Beardsley to get
to the propeller after Mr. Lovell
left the office and still smoke
half of a cigarette.

Beardsley Wouldn't have
smoked in a building where
smoking is not permitted and
I've never known him to save
butts since he rarely smokes
his own Cigarettes and there-
fore has no motivation for such
thrift.

Still, what was Kloth doing
in class ahead of the bell? I
felt that I had to be sure be
fore I dared to make any final
deductions. After all, someone
else could have moved the 9170-.

seems possible, the propellery

from the previous day. But, Mr.
Lovell has borne no ugly gash
on his head so the propeller
must have been vertical when
he left his office. Who else
would have moved it?

if Sneaky Bill hadn’t turned
the propeller it would have had
to turn itself since the others
in the class were either girls
or sophomores or both. They
weren't what anyone would
normally assocalo with propeller
turning.

i said to myself, ”Bill is up
there; I’m sure of it." With that
I bounded_up the remaining
flight of steps, ignoring the fact
that class did not commence for
another six minutes. i drew in
a deep breath and burst into
the classroom.

There he was, just as I’d}
known. I walked over to his‘
desk and said, .“Bill, 1 know,1
that you were here!" .

He was startled, “How did
you know, Bruce?” he asked.

“By the propeller,’ I smugly
replied. “But what are you don
ing up here so early?”

“I ran out of cigars," saidl

of Drake university.

that the Student Council “had

still in the tentative stage."
