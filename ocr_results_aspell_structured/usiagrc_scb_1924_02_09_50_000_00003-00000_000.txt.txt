gestion oi strength. In contrast the
new religion is one oi three dimen-
sions and is constantly struggling to
obtain an intellectual nod moral per-
spective by putting the things most
worth while in the ioreground and rele—

the middle distance and the back-
ground. Dean Sperry admitted thltt
one has to be a bit of a heretic and a
blasphemer ii he is going to find out
whet is worth while.

“mindamentsllsm is a return to the
art oi two dimensions and the giving
up the search ior perspective in moral
life" he said. The iundamentalist may
hope to hold, up the human mind in
those phases oi religion which seem
to conﬂict with science but to use the
words of Galileo, when he was forced
to recant on the movement oi the
earth about the sun, "it goes on for
all that"

The reason that liberal Christianity
has not conquered the land, in his
opinion, is because we are content to
sit on the sidelines like the spectators

Dean Sperry denim-es the present
tendency oi American students to sit
on the sidelines at athletic contests
rather than to engage in sports them-
selves. This is what he termed as
vicarious athletic exercise He further
stated that the age oi the stadium has
never been the great age of human
society and that they are an cvidcnc
of decadence. ,

The reason we are content to "sit
on the sidelines" Dean Sperry said, is
because the present organization or so—
ciety prevents us from utilizing the
creative instinct. To satisfy this de—
sire we take up an avocation but be—
coming tired of this we drop it and
content ourselves with sitting idly by
and watching others do the creative
work.

"The main charge against the scien—
tific method is that it has deprived
man of the necessity and occasion for
creative efiort", he said.

The critical attitude oi the sidelines
is at work in religion where the same
situation exists. Criticism is not in
itself bad, in the mind of Dean Sperryv
when it is accompanied by real c
atii-eness. The only service oi cri -
cism is to give permanently valid
,stufi in which you can go to work
again in the creating spirit.”

Starting with a quotation from Tol-

in life isfer man tounite with man

simple," he said. There is loneliness
all over the world. People seek
friends in the church but in their
place and only dogmas and creeds.

In speaking of the religious signiﬁ»
cance of friendship. he said: "We be»
iieve in God as a theoretical proposi-
tion, but ﬁrst oi all we believe in that
Person who has been the incarnation
of God to us through friendship. The
main office of the Christian church, he
continued, is to vindicate 'the friendli-
ness of the universe

The secret of this duty lies in the
keeping of the imagination, according
to Mr. Sperry. To understand people
,we must he able to put ourselves in
their place and that takes imagination.
“Anil religion is the force which must
add the creative power oi imagination
to what we have at hand.

Dean Sperry declared that there is
a tetrtium quid in any social experi-
ence between two men. This third
element may be represented by the
apex of a triangle while the base line
subtends the two individuals.

“The trouble with the world,” he
said. “is that we do not have an idea
high enough to unite us with all sorts
and conditions oi men. We sre‘not
subtended beneath the angle of the
vertex.”

There is only one idea big enough
to subtend along the base line all sorts
and conditions of men, in the opinion
of Mr. Sperry, and that is the idea
of God’ "We must go the long way
around through God,"

several ideas for healthy and Chrish

games and folk dancing, or passive—

gestions as to things which the church
can do to promote Christian recrea—

She told of seeing the Passion Play
and oi the inspiration received from
a visit to the home or Anton Lang.
"There was a spiritual something that
I have never had in my life anywhere
before," she said. "It was greater than
any thing I have ever heard, more
tremendous than any music which I
ever expect to hear." Her second sug-
gestion was a recreational club ior

THIRD BRADSHAIY LECTURE.

“Jesus: A Portrait in Oil," was the
subject oi the third address given by
Prolessol‘ Bradshaw before the Felr
iowship conierence Thursday morning

Taking the iourth gospel as his
text, Professor Bradshaw showed that
here tor the first time Jesus was
shown to be a real man, suliering and
rejoicing as the others did, In ad-
dition to this the fourth gospel dem—
onstrated the fact that salvation was
then at hand, that no future miracle
must occur in order to make the real—
ization oi this salvation possible.

In closing, Proicssor Bradshaw de-
clared, " Jesus may not he Omnipotent,
but still be is the means oi salva-
tion, Gail’s word for the world is
Christ,"
