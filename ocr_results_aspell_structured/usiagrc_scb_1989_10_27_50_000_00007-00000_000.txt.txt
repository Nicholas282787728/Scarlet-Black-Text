whether to reroute passenger-train service through
central Iowa. The new route would mn on Chicago and
North Western tracks only 20 miles nonh of Grinnell,

Amtrak, which new uses a
route that cuts across southern
Iowa,hasconceded that itwould
be cheaper and more profitable
to reroute passanger service
through central Iowa because
more passengers would use the
service.

WS

Rep. Tom Tauke, Republican of Iowa, told reporters
last week that he had offered an amendment to a House
authorization bill requiring Amtrak “to study the short-
term and long-rem consequences on passenger reve-
nues and operating costs of rerouting the California
Zephyr through northern Illinois and central Iowa over
the tracks of the Chicago and North Western,"

The proposed route would run through nearby
Marshalltown, Ia,

Amtrak has balked at the plan
despite strong lobbying.
