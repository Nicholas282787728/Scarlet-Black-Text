 

Scott “Doc” Lewis

° fades away

By Russ Winick

There is no truth whatsoever in
the rumor that Scott “Doc” Lewis
is being redshirted this basketball
season. Nor has the rugged 64
senior forward entered his name
on the hardship list for the NBA
draft. instead, his absence from
the familiar hardwood at Darby is
a simple case of “not being
psyched."

Lewis, a threeyear letter-man
and the Pioneer’s leading
rebounder last year, recently
decided to call it a career after
months of deliberation. “The
overall feeling I have is that I’ve
been playing basketball for a lot of
years and I feel it’s time to Stop,"
Lewis said. “There’s no one big
reasonirather a lot of in-
terconnected reasons floating
around in my mind,"

LEWIS noted that it takes a
great deal of time and effort to go
out for a sport and he sees no sense
in doing it half-heartedly. “1 just
don‘t feel I’m willing to put out
enough effort to make it worth-
while.” he said. Lewis has decided
that other pursuits will yield more
enjoyment.

The pride of New Wilmington,
Pennsylvania, Lewis was a
popular figure both with his
teammates who had elected him
capmin for this year, and the
vociferous Pioneer fans who
frequently hurled ethancleinduced
exhortations in his direction. Lewis
stressed that he feels no

animosities towards anyone, and
added that last year’s 1-20 record
was not a big factor in his decision.
”Hell, I’ve been on losing teams all
my life," he said. “My team during
junior year in high school didn't
win any gamesiat least last year
we won one!”

LEWIS WAS bestowed the
nickname “Doc” several years
ago by former hoopster Rico
Williams, who, believe it or not,
likened Lewis’ playing style to that
of the slightly better known
“Doctor J," Julius Ervingi The
long-haired, bearded history
major, who sports librarian's
' spectacles and antique Trshirts,
definitely plans to go to the home
games and renew his solidarity
with the loudmouths in the
bleachers, ‘

He realizes that he “might very
well miss basketball once the
games start. That's something I’ll
have to deal With when the time
comes. Right now I’m perfectly
comfortable with my decision."
Coach Art Peterson. and the
returning varsity cagers all said
they respect Lewis' decision,
adding that his ability and per-
sonality will surely be missed.

LEWIS SEEMED nonplussed
about the probable adverse
reaction of NBA scouts. “Pro
basketball gets all the publicity,
but the real big money nowadays is
in horse racing. I want to be a
jockey.” he said.

 

Knox defeats Pioneer’s goal

By Colin Sacks

There was excitement in the air
before last Saturday's soccer home
finale against Knox. A win would
give the Pioneers a 3-} conference
record and the conference
championship.

game. He was greeeted en-
thusiastically by applause and
cheers.

But on Saturday. the Pioneers
lost a heartbreaker, 2-1.

Grinnell’s footmen had expected
a close game. It was hoped that the
home field advantage would play a
major role. Although two starters,
D.J. Mcouitty and Gary qumkin,
were slightly injured from
previous games.

The first half featured excellent
defense by both teams. Pioneer
goalie 'Dan Dunlop played an
especially good half and the first
stanza of action ended scoreless.

Less than a minute into the
second half the Grinnell defense
was caught on its heels and after a
sudden break-away pass the

Pioneers found themselves
trailing, 1-0. The large crowd never
lost enthusiasm, and was soon
rewarded with the tying goal.
Speedster, Mark Bailey, breewd
by the Siwasher defense and lofted
a perfect centering pass from the
right wing. Center Frumkin

The goal that lost it for the
Pioneers was rather anticlimactic.
Substitute goalie Jim Michaels was
unable to handle a tough shot and
the rebound rolled gracelessly off
the foot of a Knox forward into the
Grinnell net.

The morale of the team and the
crowd dropped noticeably after
that goal and not even the superb
cheering efforts of Adeena Swig
were enough to rejuvenate them.

On the brighter side, seniors
Frumkin, Mark Krause and
Denny Minami all played well in
their last game at Grinnell. Since
they will be the only seniors lost to
graduation this year, next year’s
turnout is expected to exceed forty-
five. And so, as Grinnell’s soccer
buffs bundle up and take it inside
for the winter, they can be hopeful
about next year.

Harriers

By Tim DeCoster

At 11:00 tomorrow morning, the
starter's pistol will ring out the
beginning of the 1977 Midwest
Conference cross country meet.
There is a strong possibility that
thirty minutes later, the Grinnell
squad will have won the conference
championship for the first time in
seventeen years.

The fivermile race, which starts
and finishes by Darby Gym, is the
culmination of a Season that has
seen the Pioneers win every meet
in which they ran except their own
Les Duke Invitational. Grinnell
finished third in that meet to
overpowering Luther and local
rival Central, but has since
gained revenge against Central by
upending the Dutchmen three
times.

The three teams that Grinnell
will go against tomorrow for the
first time, Carleton, U. of Chicago,
and Lawrence, Could all be cons
tenders for the championship.

The Pioneers ended the year on
\ltS regular season at the Central
dual meet, thus establishing a 36-2
overall record, and completing the
year undefeated in dual meets.

For coach Ray Obermiller and
his squad, the season was a series
of tests before the all-important
conference meet. Grinnell will rely
on its strongest asset, depth of
talent, to vault the team ahead of
the visiting schools, Depth has
proved to be especially valuable
through the latter part of the year.

Out of this depth has sprung
perhaps the team‘s most powerful
weapon, the Pioneer Pack. While
individual runners from Various
teams are splitting the top places
in the races. the Pack is expected
to collect a series of the necessary
middle points while forcing the
third, fourth. and fifth runners of
other teams into poorer finishes.

Terry Drew has consistently
placed as Grinnell's top finisher
this year, personally winning three
races, and setting a new school
record for the five-mile. Close
behindDrew has usually been Paul
Reich. followed by the Pack, which
was born at the Central Ina
vitational, consisting of Tim
DeCoster, Dick Gilbert, Kevin
Key, and Bill Brown.

Grinnell‘s women team ended
their regular season at the Central
invitational by placing a sure
prising third and defeating a
powerful Luther College team in
the process. Throughout the
season, Grinnell’s top finishers
have been Toni Heiman, Julia
Carver, Sarah Birchford, Yafa
Napadensky, and Laurie Bailou.
The team finished with an un,
blemished 5-0 dual meet record.

Today, coach Kit Wall will at
company Carver and Heiman to
Ames to Compete in the three—mile
regional meet. The meet features
some tough competition, such as
Iowa State’s Vetter twins, who
finished one-two in the Big Eight

meet this year.

The Grinnell womens field
hockey team finished its 1977
season with a record of 4-7-7.

Coach Cindy Winkler com-
mented, “I think that it proved to
be an exciting season and the
quality of our hockey has improved
over last year’s play."

The Pioneers scored a total of
twenty-three goals this year, The
evenly
distributed among the members of
the forward line. Sophomore Kim
Krutilla was the high scorer with
eight goals.

“I was extremely pleased with
the offensive performance,"
Winkler said,

Although the team did drop
seven games. they were all close
matches.

There are four seniors leaving
the team this year. They are Sheryl
Walter, .lill Kriesky, Katie Duffy
and Val Peterson, Duffy
played goalie this year and it looks
as though that will be a tough
position to fill next year.

Winkler stated in closing,
