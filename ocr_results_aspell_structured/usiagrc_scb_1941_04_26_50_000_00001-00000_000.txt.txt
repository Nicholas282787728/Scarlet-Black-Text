Variety Show Plans, Changed

"No Open Dale
Available Now,II
Nelson Sl‘a’res

There seems to be no open
date for the performance 01"
the Ray NelsonaAntllony Vl'a.
lleli-Mal‘k Moody Musical
show, according to Nelson. The
original date of May 16 was
changed last week to May 15 due
to the Midwest conference track
meet at Beloit. Some of the the
members of the cast would have
to go on that trip.

“Then, out of a clear sky yes-
terday," said Nelson, “We found
that the high school commence-

’ merit play cast would need their
auditorium for dress rehearsal on
May 15, That sort of cramps our
style, as that was where the
show was to be produced."

Another attempt to move the
date, this time to May 26, con-
rlicted with the high school
Junior prom, so now the only
solution seems to be the can—
cellation of the show, according
to Nelson.

"However," Nelson stated, “It
all the members of the cast will
definitely be eligible, and if some
of the events scheduled during the
week of May 19 to 24 are can-
celled, there is still the remote
possibility that the show can be
presented tlieh."
