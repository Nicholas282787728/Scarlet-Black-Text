has had two financial campaigns in
recent years, the first of these ending
in December, 1905, and the second in
April, 1914. Each of these added to
the college resources a half million

ones have caused Grinnell to be ree-
ognizetl as one of the standard col-

The Department of Public Affairs
has perhaps aroused the greatest in—
terest. This was organized about six
years ago, and includes the subjects
of finance, political science. economs
ice, and the numerous problems re»
toting to commerce. Work in this
department has grown to notable pl'o~
portions. and has incorporated itself
as an essential part of the curriculum.

The founding oi the Health Depart-
ment marks a new era in the physical
life of Grinnell. and is not excelled
by any Iowa institution. inasmuch as
it has for its head a phy. eiau oi high
