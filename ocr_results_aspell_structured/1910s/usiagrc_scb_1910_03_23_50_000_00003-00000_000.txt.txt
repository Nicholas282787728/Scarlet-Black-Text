It is reasonable to believe that we would
not constantly dwell upon the merit of
Adler’s Collegian Clothes if our experience
had not taught us to thoroughly respect
the Wonderful value one obtains when he
buys a garment of this well known make.

In quality they have no equal.

materials throughout is one oftheir strong

characteristics. When

it comes to the

question of style, we have never seen gar-
ments from any other maker which

possess these artistic lines and which 'so
strongly appeal to the young man, who
demands every feature of fashion.
would like to Show you a few of the new

Spring Suits and Cravenetts and let you

try on your size, whether you want to buy

or not.
