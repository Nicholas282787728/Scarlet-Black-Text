At the satire time that the American
people are trying to sell their manu-
factured products the European nae

ter nation is stepping from the ranhs
of those nations than produce all they
need to eat to those of manufacturing
nations. and as this process goes on
the competition for international mlm

dispose of their mauuiactureu products
and with the proceeds buy the needed
foodstnn's and raw materials, grows

“There is no duestron nut that right
here is where you can lind the root or

“and it loohs as if we are likewise to

in: or the irontier is the increase inl

the cost or living. Tllls is due to the
fact that the ratio of the population
to the production or ioodstuiis has
enormously increased. The immigrant
is also a iactor in this sitrratioii. He
has increased Lhe consuming side witlr
out in a corresponding degree increas-
ing the producing side.

With the ending of the irontier there
is hound to he a. change in the Ameri-
can mind, it was here emphasized. The
old idea that our natural resources
were inexhaustible is new passing
away and we are learning the lesson
of cullsel'vaiion‘ almost too late, said
Professor Ross.

Looking at the spiritual side of the‘

question. it_ uas pointed out that the
West was the place where social equal

been the cradle of political deiiiocrar.,
That the frontier has been the home
of American freedom, was a strong
statement or the speaker.

Concluding, Professor Ross said:

"Does this mean that we are going to;
There are

European nations with no free land
that have developed in the direction
of democracy,7France, Switzerland,I
and others, And so alongside the phi
sical West that has gone there is a
spiritual West. This spiritual West is
there still,

Eruund in this country that is dominat-
ed by the physical West."

Professor Ross spoke to a. crowded
chapel this morning on the subject,
"The Problems of Women and the
Family." The changes in woman's

economic and social position. due to
the industrial trairsiormations of (he
last forty years, constituted the theme
or an address that was heard rrrti
great interest by the audience.

in the first half oi this century,
when all the necessaries oi liie were
manufactured the home, women
were of as equal economic importance
in the support of the family as ineir.
But today the factory supplies most
of the articles formerly made in the
household. The change has talien place
from household production to factory
production, leaving women with a large
amount of unoccupied time.

"What has been done h, the inmates
of the household with the time thus
released? One of the consequences of
the shrinkage of the duties of the
household has been a great migration
of utlmal‘i'led Women from the houses
hold into industry," said air. Ross.
At present there are shout nine million
women. nearly all rrmnarricd, earning
money oursnle of the home, This has
created rery suddenly the groin. [ll‘vll-

“now are the women who stay in

forced to talrc some lirrid or employ-
“lent to offset tlle ultimate expense to
the home of the factory sisiem of pt'or
ductiorr.

’l‘lle llives or the wealthier iueir are
absolutely released from the necessity
or working and are therefore turning
their energies and time to other fields.
Some are in religious and social work,
some are deroting themselves to the
instruction and training of their cliilc

But the most important field outside

rTlle situation as it now stands is with

‘ The speaker emphasized that the 0th

lSHOULD BE REALIST AND
IDEALIST, SAYS MR. MAIN

Inspiring Address Given By Presi-
dent At Vespers.

The l‘act alone that Jesus shorted
us how to “Va is an oierwlielniing
claim on us,”
his Vesper talk Sunday afternoon
There are two types of people in the
world, said the speaker. the kind that
loan see only today with no regr d for
the iuture, and the other who dreams

about the iiiture and are careless and
indiirereiit about the present, There
must be some interaction between to-
day and tomorrow, emphasized Mr
Maui, and the achieving type of man
is the one who urites both in due pro
portion.

Jesus has a realist, said Llle speaker,
in that he saw things as they were and
didn't hesitate to far-c them; and he
was also an idealist in that he saw
things as they were goiirg to he and
always saw a good future for men
