victory when Hort closed up a gap of
nearly ten yards between himself and

half mile relay, Grinncll was able to
dcieai Drake for the [ninth time this
year in the annual dual meet held last
Saturday afternoon on Ward Field.
The iinal score was 65% to bug
and before the short relay, the last
event ol the meet, was run, Drake held
the lead by one point. By upsetting
the dope in the two mile, Sprinkle gave
five points toward the winning count
and Van Dorn added three with a
third in the long race The result ot

all the way through. and the closeness
of the score kept excitement running
