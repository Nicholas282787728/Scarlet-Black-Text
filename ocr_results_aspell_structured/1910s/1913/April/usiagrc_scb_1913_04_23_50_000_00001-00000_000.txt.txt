“CHRISTIANITY
AND COLLEGE MAN”
AT CHAPEL.

MBHNING GLASSES SHUHTENED

Dr. Black and Dr. Scares Here

for Fellowship Conference—
Long Chapel Thursday
and Friday.

Glitlncll is entertaining a hundred

and twenty-ﬁve visiting ministers and

delegates to the Fellowship Conici-ence,
a union meeting or the Des ltloines and
Grinnell Associations or the Congrega-
tional Church, and the addresses of
Dr. Hugh Blaclt and Dr. Theodore G.
Soar-cs are attracting enthusiastic audi-
ences of towrr and college people. The
addresses by Dr. mach on “Christian-
ity and the Modern Man," scheduled tor
four-ﬁfteen on Tuesday. Wednesday
and Thursday, have been changed to
the chapel hour and classes are being
shortened to lul‘tysﬁve minutes in order
that thc students may all licai- thorn.
The address yestcr day alteration was
introductory and its vital interest and
the ltecn wit of the Speaker have been
the subicct oi much comment. Dr.
Elaclt discussed the present gellcral l'e-
liglous unrest, showing how it need
not be alarming, that change in Hall;
ions conceptions were as natural as
detclopmcnt iir men and that in the
end a stronger attitude toward lile
could be secured, for “religion is tun-
darncntally present."
