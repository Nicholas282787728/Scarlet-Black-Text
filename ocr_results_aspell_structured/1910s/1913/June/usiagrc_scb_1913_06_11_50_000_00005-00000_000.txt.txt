Saturday morning in Herrick Chapel,

iiy ot a high standard. The easy stage
presence or all was especially come
niritdublc. For the 'ileziliers, a new
plan was tried out: A general Sulle
lest was posted three hours before the
contest, and then each speaker was
given some special phase at this geib
etal topic. The spcttlter was given
his separate topic six minutes helore

many times demonstrated his worth as

Neetihain and Mr. Brann are much on
it par its to ability. Eotll lizive a clear
eniiiiciation and pleasing voices, and
sing with ease and assurance.
