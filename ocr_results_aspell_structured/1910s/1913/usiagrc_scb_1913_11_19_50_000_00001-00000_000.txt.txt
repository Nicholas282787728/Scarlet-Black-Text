LARSIIN AND ANDERSON ARE ﬂIIT

$4.20—FOR A VICTORY AT MOUNT VERNON—$4.20 I

 

 

Four dollars and twenty cents is the fare to Mount Vernon,—the price to you of a victory over
Cornell. Is it worth the money? You, Seniors, who have seen Grinnell defeated tllree years in succes-
sion, in what is always the crucial game of the season—is it not worth a ﬁve-dollar bill to help make
your last football season in Grinnell a successful one? And you, Freshmen, will you not feel well
repaid for this nominal sacriﬁce if you are permitted to witness 2i. victory Over Cornell at the outset of
your career in Grinnell? Sophomores, Juniors, this may be your last chance to realize an ambition
always held by Grinnell students.

According to the latest reports. a Grinnell special to Mount Vel' non is practically assured. The
time of departure will be announced at the mass-meeting Friday night. The Cornell Special last year
brought to Grinnell nearly the entire student body of the college at Mt. Vernon, and this bunch went
out and out-rooted Grinnell on their own ﬁeld! Now, it is up to us to pay them back in their own
coin. The failure of the Grinnell “rooters” lost the Cornell game last year. Let them win it back
next Saturday.

Every man in Grinnell is expected to appear at Blair Hall at nine o'clock tonight. The societies
will adjourn at that time, and in conjunction with the other men of the institutionwill hold the biggest
men’s mass-meeting ever held in Grinnelli Attendance is not 'option Lil—every man must be there.

'A committee is worldng on plans for the “inferno-raiser" next Friday night. At this time,
every student not having it good excuse must decide to go to Cornell or be ostracized. Decide now,
and save two days of worry. We'll all be there!

Between now and Saturday morning, talk footballﬁtailk Cornell!

(Continued on Page U

If you cannot possibly go,

don’t tell any one; if you can, tell everybody. All that is necessary to start the procession to Cornell,
is to have ﬁfty men say they are going, while those who are not going keep their sorrow to themselves.
Make it seem unanimous, and it will become so.

This is our last chance to redeem the record of the season. Our success depends upon the size of the
crowd on the Cornell Special next Saturday. If you lack conﬁdence in the ability oi the team, just

recall that holocaust that struck Penn College last Friday when,

with the advent of Witters and Little,

the team found itself! Looked pretty good to see Formation “B” tear up the opposition once again,
didn’t it'l. The difference at that time was not in the addition of the two players, it was in the accom.
partying acquisition of conﬁdence—of spirit, by the members of the team. A united student body
back of the team, and accompanying it in the invasion of hostile territory next Saturday, will renew
that conﬁdence, and make it possible for us to Walk over any team Cornell ever put on the ﬁeld.

Come out tonight, and get the Spirit. Add to it for Friday night, and Saturday morning will I

witness a northward emigration of the entire student body. Yes, and morewif each member does his
part, the returning crowd will bear no resemblance to the glum tr ainloztd that came back from

Des Moines after the Drake game. They will have experienced the

j oy of accomplishmentﬁof a victory

fairly won, and the ever-to-he-rem embered “Return from Drake” of Nov. 16, 1912, will be repeated.
