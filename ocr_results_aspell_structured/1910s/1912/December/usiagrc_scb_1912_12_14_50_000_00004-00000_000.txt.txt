The greatest retarding inﬂuence is
doubtless the English movement wlitcli

Cairie Nation type, hunger strilres,
postal robberies, etc, the American
women have cool-med themselvcs to
couiieous and conservative campaign

The seemingly sudden

change in American politics. until the

with great movements, social, moral

the tact that reforms among men are
shortliied and that they need the metal

which cultured, wide-awake, thinking
women will give them.

it the movement continues with its
