Sttttlciltr of Gnmtt‘ll:

Sincc reading lull class letter,
i am nnprcssed wltll the number ot
school teachers ill our milks. it is
also intelcstiug to notc how many
are ﬁlling yo 3 creditable positions,
which some one else may be cagcr to
ﬁll and could all as w ell, cveu ttlo it
does hurt our cgotisnt to think so.

i wish to otter a suggestion tor thc
consideration oi the graduat' g cla
wtlo are, just about now, writing lot.
ters or application, asking protcs ls
tor l-ecolnlncndutiolls and wondering
it they will be able to evade the neces-
sity or a teachers agency.

We have heard chapel and vespcr
talks on “Se '63" and telt inspired
to do something worth willie. it you
truly wish to render service, there is
a big ﬁeld waitig tor you in the Schools
of the American Missionary Associa-
tion.

Tile teachers in their schools at pres-
ent Seem to tail into four classes:
Those who cannot get positions any-
where else and have dritted into it:
those who are getting experience and
will then leave iol- something else;
thoso who lore the work and hope to
accomplish a genuine service by mak~
ing it their liteworh; and those who
are using it as an apprenticeship for
foreign work.

its ﬁnancial rewards are not large,
though they are in eitect little helow
the ﬁrst wages or the average teacher's
position, and one may really save more
than the average teacher in a small
iowa town. There are the adranmges
or travel, new scenes and experiences.
There is a certain satlslacllon, which
one does not necessarily tallo as per-
sonal. in being told that it you were
not doing what you are, the people ior
whom yoll work would be deprived ot
tho privileges they now have.

Talia Beach lnstitutc as an example:

it has been located in Savannah
since the sixties and some of the most
inﬂuential colored men ot the city
were graduated [ruin it, tor example,
the editor or the “Savannah Tribune”,
3 weekly papcr l-un entirely by colored
people. Then there are prominent
colored doctors and lawyers in the city
who began their Education in some oi
the American Missionary Association
schools have or elsewhere. They deep-
ly appreciate the privileges which have
been given to them and are loyal
friend oi the Association.

Savannah has no high school tor
the colored youth and our ambition is
that Beach lnstituta should all this
position adequately. A low more con-
secreted workers would go iurthcr to-
ward solving the “race problem" than
many books written on the subject.

May not some oi: the inspired Grin
nell students be looking tor just such
an opportunity? One at its graduates,
Rev. ii. Paul Douglass. is a Secretary
oi the Association. and is always glad
to hear that a Grinnell student wishes
a position in one or the schools. Taro
a look at the "American Missionary"
llagazinc in racl; in the Library read
ing room and see it this is not what
you want.
