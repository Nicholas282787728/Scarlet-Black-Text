THE CHIEF JIUSICIA

At the conclusion of a Festival ill
which the artistic and enjoidble [eats
tires “are largely due to tile eitorts of
one man and the points 0[ Weakness
and {allure to others and unavoidable
by that man, we should pause to recog-
nize simply the debt which Grinnell
owes to Professor George L, Pierce.
With his time and energy taxed by
plentiful routine duties, he carried on
the musical and ﬁnancial arrangements

for our biggest event in this line and .

its comparative success was made pos-
ishle only by his throwing all he hod
into it. He tirelessh drilled a chorus
which was cxnsperatingly indiitereni.
irregular and unresponsive He had
to malie big plans with small capital
and eniorco rcosonaoly good attendr‘
auce against the obstacles oi small in
lerest and universal “hrolrcness”
among the students. He was hump
orod by the un aeonnnodatlng und dis
gusting attitude of a selirsallsﬁea or.
chestra manager. But, in spt'

these things- he surcccdrd in giving to

College and tho community what it
