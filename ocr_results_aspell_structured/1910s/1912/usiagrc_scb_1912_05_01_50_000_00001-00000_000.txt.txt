the determination of the Junior Board
to make the book a real rcmindcr of
tile happenings oi the past year.

The dcdicnliou oi the book to Pro-

ution opposite Mr. Pct-it's picture are
echoed by all the classes as well as
Nlnctccu Thirteen. The printing and
engraving are most excellent, and do
lnuch toward giving the hook its artis-
tic appearance. Thc engravings are
probably the host which have ever
appeared in a Grinncll Annual, and the
pictures are prolusc and for tile most
part carefully selected. The shadow

Tho picture oi President Main in his

Some distinctive lcatures of the
