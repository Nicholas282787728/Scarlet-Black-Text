“llLlJJiBAIJS” TALK :1

Old-Time Players See Hope for
Grinnell in Her Fighting
Spirit.

Dr. E. S. Evans in a reminiscent
mood said: ‘The last Amos. nnnell
game that I remember \\‘as one in
“Mali I played eleven years ago. Grin-
nell won 230. Since 1901 \\‘e have not
won a game from the Aggies. Up until
1898 uheii Allies won ironi us by a
score of 45-0 I do not rtLall another
Ames victory. Since the game of '93
Amos has ollt\\€ll‘lll,\'. at least, regarded
the Grinnell game as more or less of a
practice contest, but there is no telling
what the Gl‘lltlllEll Spirit may (lo next
Saturday. I hope We can regain the
seemingly lost art of deﬂating our old
opponents."

lilr. Janna, Assistant to the Presi-
dent, “as more optimistic than some
of our older alumni. He said Our
defense must be better than it has
been showing in the last few days, but
We cannot predict “hat our famous
Spirit will accomplish against Amos.
I believe we have n i-aiilai-ltalile team
on offense and it nml' be unfair to
judge harshly ot our defense nhell the
men are shifting positions as they are
and when they are not keyed up to a
ﬁghting pitch. I say that there is a
possibility of holding Ames to a low
score and that our fast backﬁeld will
push the ball over [or a touchdown. or
two, I have all the hope that Grinnell
will in and I Will indeed be greatly
surprised if \\e (lo not pla\' the best
game of the Season thus I‘al

Dr. C. E. Hal 's, an old Ul‘ilmell
football coach in the unofﬁcial (lays
said: “The advantages of thls Amos
game are many. “'9 have been beaten
by Amos steadily for ten Yours and the
man who goes into that game with a
ﬁghting Spirit year aftel 'ear is indced
worthy of his place on the team. On
the other hand, that player who, gii ing
up against his stronger opponents with»
out struggle lai‘s liiinselt' open for
membership on the Scrubs. Thou, too.
our tendency to over-conﬁdence in the
following games is eliminated, l'ol'i
should We Win it \\'(l\ll(l be bl' a Very
narrow margin.

I am of the opinion that \\e should
not over-exert ourselws in [his game:

‘ \\e should set neither our t in liol our
spirits too Inllrll on edge. “or our Iuls
hol'tant games are l'ct to coma. The
anti-climax ol‘ defeat Ina' dishearten
us if \\e have too slrongh hoped for
victory and (to not win it But I do
not want to give a Deal h illlprrs on.
I have not seen either team in action
this year and Grinliell may have the
stuff this )eﬂl' to whip Allies. I hope
so. It would be a great \ir‘torl' for
hEr." ‘

Meetings

Rally Tonight.

The st or ﬂu cl talk to llie
lnell last night is found ili llie words of
Jesus to his deciples when he said. ‘1:
any man will come alter me, let him
tlom' liimsell‘. and take up his Cross
mid {allow me."

“The ﬁrst (ssential to a Cllrisliziti
his is sacrifice and selfrdellial; oror-
comiiig the personal eilj itellts of a
selﬁsh nature and turning toward
things or a material service (or others."
The second essential, as linrrey puts .
is for man to “bear his cross." Tho
courage and strength of a man to
sland for his convictions and let all the
world see him in his beliefs, is one
way a. man may “bear his Gloss."
Again, man may liclll hear his cross
by becoming ailiilhtrd and bring an
aolive member in the church. Laslly.
Jesus said, that a true Christian will
“roilow me." Huii-cy pointed out the
three rlasscs of men in the world
todr . Men who are ﬁghting lor what
