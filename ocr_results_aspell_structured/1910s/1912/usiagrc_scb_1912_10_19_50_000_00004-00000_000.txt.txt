PROF. PECK LEADS Y. M.‘

Talks on Action in Christianity at
Thursday Meeting.

In a quiet, nlsnrttymalx talk, Profes-
sor Paul Peck spoke to the men or the
young Men's Christian Association
Thursday cvtuing on the subject of
”Action in Christianity." preparatory
to the llurrey meetings at n -t week.
“l.\li\n‘s Actions." said Fl'ofessor Peck.
“dependonore upon his ballots and
disbelrels than on environment. Be-
liets are, therefore. at the greatest im-
portance for as a man things. so is he."
You cannot aliord to think the evil
thing for sooner or inter, inevitably,
that thing will be written that all may
SEQ. '

Faith is the basis or a man's
strength. its importance is shown by
the many times it is reiterated in the
New Testament There we read that
it We had iaith the size of a mustard
seed we could move mountains. “This
may seem exaggerated to us," Mr. Peck
said, "but it. is merely the oriental
method of limiting impressive the met
that laitlr is the source at the strength
of man, And it is Llle ioundation at
an active aggressive Christian life."

Christ was nlwal ddllve — never
passive. Huh-(ls a. codingly practical
in the application of religion to over
day life. “Faith without, norks, l
lrci n'thont action.“ rolicltlded Mr.
Peck, "is it very illllleI'Iet-t Christian
Ilicfnot a me that is real and true,
And we should all, in looking tor-ward
in the meetings of the ("timing ucclr.
determine to be ﬂ‘doer "
