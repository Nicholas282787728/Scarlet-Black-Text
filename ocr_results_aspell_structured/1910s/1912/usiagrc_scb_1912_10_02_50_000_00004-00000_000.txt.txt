or the play concerns a man and a no
man happily married and surrounded
with every luxury that money and our
turn can secure. But the husband is
an unbelierer, an atheist, n ithout faith
of any hind.

There is a jarring note in the house

with the peace and love or its members.
No one notices this until a friend or
the husband comes, Father Kelly, 9.

deep insight into human nature and a
divine love for his iel\ow men. And
when stress and trouble comes, when
the home is wrecked and husband and

courage and faith that saves them,
di-ii s away the clouds ot suspicion,
doubt, mistrust, and brings them hoth
