[Bx H. w, i‘IATLACK-l

The Glee Club which is the pride ot
Grinnell and justly so, gave its eigh-
teenth annual Home Concert last eve
ening beiore an audience which nearly
ﬁlled Herl'ick Chapel.

Allin all the good things which
have been said about previous clubs
are true or tlils one. As a musical
unit it is perhaps the most etlicient
oi the several able organizations the
college enjoys. This year‘s club is
especially excellent in ﬁne ciiccts,
such as delicately graded pianissimo,
clean intonation in subtle harmonic ere
iects, and ﬁne blending. There is a
mar-lied improvement in the trecdom
and elasticity ot phrasing: both
breathing and phrasing are quite irce
ironi the mechanical and stilted habits
generally iound in
singing. This mastery ot ﬁne pin-as-
ing, and ﬁcxibiiity in tempo, is the
best ieature oi the club’s work, and
has been acquired only l the most
patient drill; it could not have been
attained had the personnel oi the
club been less musical, iior under a
director oi less than the truest musical
instinct.

The ﬁrst tenor section was especially
line in ariiet eiiects; in iortissuno it
was not so good, as the brunt oi the
battle scented to tail on one or two
singers. The second terror, in spite
or Mr, Manuel's absence, carried its
part well: but there was a proiionnccd
aggressiveness of individual voices,
duo to their reduced number. The
baritone and bass sections are sllleilr
did, it is a pity to read the iateiul rig
iires .. '12" after so many names iii
these two sections, tor ll will be diifis
cultto bring new material up to the
present standard,

The program aborrndcd in bearrtiiui
music; its most ettective iiniiibers, as
music, were Mcwlmod's ‘Al senre" and
Chaflii's “Shams oi‘Sigllillg.” other
numbers were hilly as enjoyable as
thes : as a matttr oi iact the most
enioyabic numbers at a gleeolub cons
cert are not necessarily the ﬁnest urn-
sic. and this leads to tire sirggcstion
that’our home coiiccrt programs liaro,
in genoral, been too consciously mus r

iii-st two parts oi the program wtrc a
little too unrelicvedly avc: and
their grarity was tiooponcd by a loud»
ency to sing too slowly, cspe ally in
the “Songs or the Soulhland."

or its pieces is or the ghost quality,
and is ot a degree ent' iorcign to
amateur musical organiations. and

First Time Yesterday — Mr
Hanson Leads the Service.

The Seniors made their ﬁrst appear

the entire class “as present and the
cap and gowns added a touch that was
quite impressive.

“Sons of old Grinnell,” he gave the
address. taking for his theme the well-
:roundcd physiological fact that our
apprecl tion of liie is limitcd wholly
by our own experience. Tile old
phrase " xperieuce is the best
teacher" should be changed to “experi-
ence is the only teacher.”

it is very natural lor us to think
that we possess an intuitive power at
appreciating things outside our e ,
perience but in reality we see in lite
oilly what we are loolring tor and what
we are prepared to see.

Sometimes in harshly judging olh»
crs our fault lies in the iact that we
rend our own particular experiences
into the lives at others. We are not‘
in a position to sympathize with a p
son in a time or trouble unlcss we our-

LIVELY “FUNERAL" FRIDAY

Freshmen Refuse to Die at Sopho-
more Request. and Strenuous
Time Ensues—No Bard Results.

A bit of excitement was lurnished
following chapel yesterday morn-
ing, when some Sophomores attempted
to present a “stunt” Celebrating the
death (7) or the Class of 1915. A
head-board for the grave, a coffin, a
hoarse and a iuneral procession iorur
ed the center of an impromptu scrap
between a number of Sophs and the
enraged ﬁrst-year men. Tllc funeral
was indeﬁnitely postponed because of
objections on the part of the Fi'esl‘i'
meii, who were more numerous than
their elders, The Freshmen persisted
in as iting their right to live and al-
togcther the obscquics were decidedly
lively. The “stunt" originally plan.
