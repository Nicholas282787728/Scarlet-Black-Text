Meeting is Strongest One In Re

Dl'. Steiner addrcs ed ‘1. M. Thurs-
day evening on the subject: “The For»
sonal Relationship or God to Man." 13i-
way oi introduction, Mr. Steiner stated
that he was unable to tuliii the rash

religion is one at the heart, not oi
the nillldisonleilling he knew. hrrt

ligion when he read the New Testnr

came to linow Christ.

Mr. steirrer named three ways in
which religion become real
through a personal aeriiiairrtance with
God. rirst comes prayer, which may
not change God's purpose, but changes
the man. The second inﬂuence in los-
tering this relationship is contempla-
tion ot the Word or God. And the third
element is real iinselirshness, which is
absolutely disinterested, and without
airy ulterior nrotivc. it is primarily
thru these three ideals that a personal
relationship uitli Gail may he brought
