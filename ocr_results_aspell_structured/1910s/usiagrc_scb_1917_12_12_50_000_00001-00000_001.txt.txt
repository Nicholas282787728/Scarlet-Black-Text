Tells How Heavy Floods

Place Will Not Be Habitable for
MonthsiLoss Will Total

By Helen Mnchchron

TECHOU, Chins—The life of a miss
sionary in this port oi China does not
lacls variety just at present, for we
do not know what is going to happen
next. Tcehou has come in tor the
hoods and is simply unmhabrtable.

Last Friday at 9 o’clock the rep t
came from good sources that the bank
of the Grand canal had broken a sec-
ond time and that they were not t
ing to darn it up any more. hiu Mac-
Eachron right away began to get
things in order over at the boys‘
school and at our housththat is, mov-
ing things up out of the cellars.

{’0th Into Cellar

By noon Saturday it was’ pouring
into our cellars like a waLerffill—the
most gruesome sound you ever heard
—and by Saturday night it was all
over the compound, so that about 9
o'clock,Mr. MacEachron and 1 went
calling over to the ladies' house on a
raft. I forgot to say that he had

, built a raft Friday afternoon, and he
and Lyman Cady built a bigger one
Saturday morning.

Sunday morning the water kept ris-
ing, and by 6 at night it was over the
ﬂoor of our porch, so we carried all
or our books and dishes upstairs and
put the furniture up on bricks about
eight inches off the ﬂoor, as we ug-
ured at the rate the water was rising
it cohld not get up much more than
six inches by morning. Well, it rose
ten inches in the night and was six
inches on the door by morning, so we
had to move everything upstairs.

Forced to Leave

Monday morning we decided to
leave as soon as we could get away,
and packed trunks furiously all day,
putting in the most valuable of our
things—bedding, silver, linen, best
pictures, all our clothes, etc. The
water was rising an inch an hour
then, and we were afraid we would
have to lose some things All this
time we were sleeping very poorly—
about two or three hours a night. We
left Wednesday morning.

Baby and I had to crawl out of the
second story window to the boat. We
landed in a dry spot in Techou, which
happened to be right behind the
church. We had to unload the small
boat and have all the things carried
across the city to the canal. 1 hope
that 1 never have to look on such a
scene of desolation again.

Mnny lire Drowned

The native mud houses iall down as
soon as the water gets under the
foundations, and hundreds had fallen
down and the people had fled, The
report was that forty oi fifty had al-
rcady hccn drowned in Techou. A
good many of the streets were banked
up in a pitiful attempt to keep the
watcr out a little time. The walled
city was shut up and it was the south
suburb that was getting the water.
The people all gathered and followed
and asked ii we were afraid and
where we were going,

We have been fairly comfortable on
these boats. They are about 5 feet
wide and about to feet long. There
are live boatiooo, a woman and a
child, two servants, besides ourselves.
so you can imagine how crowded ltis.
We have a sail, and four men row all
the time. paul packed that big Amer-
ican ﬂttg we had, and Lee Miles also
had one. When we started the boat-
men asked for a flag, as they wanted
to hoist the U. S. colors for protec-

_ tion. In such panicky times there is
no telling what the natives will do.

NORRIS THINKS GERMAN
IMPORTANT IN BIOLOGY

l’roiesstir Heller 3 TIME Alllnl‘icll will
lie Biological Collier Wllell Wm:
Is Over

That the German language is in the
trout rank of foreign , languages
uccessary to the exhaustive study of
biology, and that it will continue lo
be important, no matter what the out-
come of the war, is the opinion of
Prolossor H. w. Norris as expressed
in a recent interview.

In comparing German with French
ho Said: “There are probably tcu
references in German to one in
French.” One of the reasons for this
preponderant use of German in bio-
logical writings, he'cxplained, is th.
tendency of Norwegians, Swedes, 'and
scientiﬁc investigators of all neigh-
boring small countries to publish
their works in this language. He
pointed out that German research has
been mostly elaboration of details
rather than of pioneer nature.

v s. to he biologlenl Center

Professor Norris thinks that the
war will help to make the United
States the headquarters for the blur
logical field. "Since the war began
Americans have been forging ahead
tremendously fast, and if this progress
continues 1 look to see the biological
center shift to the United states after
the war,” was the professor's opt/Dr
mistic opinion, He pointed to the re
cent rapid development of biological
journals in this country as an ima
portant indication of thc movement,

Regardless of the after-~thc-war de»
vrlopments, “it will be a long time
beiore we can ignore German," he
continued.

DOMPARES GERMAN WRITERS

Professor l’errlug I lisses Lileru-
Lure of Sociallsﬁc Authors

Present Germ. r Shite imposed Upon
Fcnple by Autocruiic G0", He Says

To condemn the whole Germzm lit-
erature since Goethe and Schiller
seems to cast aside the documents
which express the aims of the Ger—
man people as conti sted with their
imperial government‘is the view c.
pressed by Prof, R. H. Pei-ring in
chapel Tuesday.

From the standpoint of a strident
of German litcraturc. he defended the
socialistic writers, who “dug deep into
the human heart and human society."
He said the present Gcrman state was
“not developed from and instituted by
the people themselves, but imposed
upon them by n government still rc-
milling autocratic power.”

"Will the German people awaken to
their old-time social ideals and the
sense of their own rights?”'he asked
in conclusion.

Disclldses Tuberculosis
Professor J. W. Gmlnaway spoke in
chapel Monday on "Tuberculosis as
the Great Scourge uf the War." He
suggested that students guard them—

selves and join ill the crusade lo
stamp out this disease.

GRINNELLIANS ON BOTH TEAMS-

Follr Varsity Men on All-State
and Former Fresh Captain
on Army Team

The mythical allrslate collegiate,
iootbnll team suddenly a mood pbys
iral proportions at D Monies last
Saturday and defeated the cluster
Camp Dodge team by a 74) score, The
game was played at the Drake stad-
mm in a temperature that hovered
around the zero mark all during the
game.

Four Grluuell mcn — Augustine,
Watt, Osgood and Hoyt— played with
the collogians, and a former Grinnell-
ion, George Whitmcr, played with the
Camp Dodge warriors. Reed of lowa
had the honor of making the only
touchdown of the game in the third
period, after his teammate, Green—
wood, had blocked a punt which rolled
over the army's goal line and which
heed recovered for a touchdown.

Johnson of Morningside klckedl‘the
Suzi].

Weft Is Sm

Watt is mentioned with Johnson as
the star of the game. His work as
defenswe back was especially good,
and he made the best showing when
11. came to handling punts. He did
not fumble a single punt, despite the
extreme cold, and only once did he
[oil to make at least a 5—yard return.

One of his returns was instrumen-
lnl in securing the only score of the
game. Robertson of the army minted,
and Watt tore off twenty yards before
he was downed, putting the ball on
the army's 30ryard line, A play fa—
miliar to Gi-innell faus~a forward
pass from Augustine to, Watt—was
good for eight yards, and on the next
play the Collegian: made it ﬁrst down.
The army recovered a fumble on the
next play, but yet-e penalized ﬁfteen
yards, and Robertson Was forced to
pilot from behind the goal post, the
touchdown resulting when the kick
was blocked and Reed recovered.

Not it Financial Success

Thu game was played to raise funds
{01 the equipment of a gymnasium at
Camp Dodge, and was decidedly not

only a few people attended the game
