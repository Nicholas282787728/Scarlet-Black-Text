HE SPRINTED.

If one had happened to pass along
a. curtain street in the city oi Chicago
twenty years alga he would, have nor
ticcd a small building bearing the sign
"‘Arinour 5. Co., Meat Packers." Pass-
ing along that same stl'et today, one
sees groups 0[ buildings covering
acres, each hearing that saluc name.

Almost overnight J. Ogden Armour
has developed his small company from
one doing a few thousand dollars
Worth of business a YGal' to a. great
corporation which in 1918 reported to
thc government sales of $8ﬁ1,000,000.

He didn't recline in his easy chair
reading the sporting page of "The
“Vorllls Greatest Newspaper” While he
waited for business to came his way.
He stayed awake nights devising new
schemes to bring him more orders, and
he put those new schemes into prac-
tlce the next morning hciorc he had
a chance to forget them. His enthusi-
ash) never waned, it was always at
White heat.

Opportunity is alive and kicking to»
day just as it was then, but the days
when it came to tlie (1001‘ and knocked
have long since passsdrthey were
monuments to the stone age even when
Armuul' started in business.

The man who lopos along will al-
ways be eating Opportunity-s dost. Ar-

FLOWERS FOR THE BANQUET

A. certain feeling toward the Girls'
“Honur G" banquet has grown out
of the custom of sending ﬂowers on
this occasion. This sentiment is ex»
pressed by many girls at the quad-
rangle when the annual question of
issuing an invitation comes up. It
really is an affair of the yearyet many
a girl hesitates to ask a guest because
“he'll think that he must send
flowers". When so many girls feel this
way, a man may he assured that. altho
the sending of flowers is 8. Very grac-
ious thing to do, there will ho no “of—
fcnsc” i. he docs not do it. In fact.
many a girl would sincerely feel hap—
pier about it. ,
