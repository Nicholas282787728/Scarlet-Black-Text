last year. It could not star in the
headquarters of the stall any longer
and the payments had stopped as there
weer so [ow Building One incn hack.

so the girls of'Cottngc One came
forward offering to take the piano into
111 ii'lng room, continuing the buy
111g of it.

In this \\'ay they are hecnuig the
piano "in the family" while the \l‘zu'
lasts, Needless to say, every girl is
delighted with the heeutilul addition to
the living room.
