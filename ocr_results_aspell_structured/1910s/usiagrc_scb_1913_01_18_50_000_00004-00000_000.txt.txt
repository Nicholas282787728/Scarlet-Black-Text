A HEART TO HEART
TALK ABOUT
VALUES

By “values" we do not mean
to sell inferior goods at a lowcr
price-”but sell the remainder of
our past season's choicest stock
at prices far below what the
merchandise is really worth.

You want good goods with
each season-wand by making
great price reductions twice a
year we are able to disposc of
the broken lots and lines and
oﬂcr only the new creations at
the time you expect them.

There's a reason for that
word, “Values"iwc'vc tried to
make it plain.
