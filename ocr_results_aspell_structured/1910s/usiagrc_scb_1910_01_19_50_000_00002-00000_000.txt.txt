THE VESPER SERVICES.

“1 would like to know what time
this service begins," was the remark
made by a senior last Sunday ii lien,
on coming into the service just as the
hell had started to ring, he tound him-
sel: late. It is certainly to he desired
that every one be prompt in coming to
the Vesper sci-vice, hut when the. ssh
vice may begin anyuhere within live
minutes before or alter the proper tiiue
it is rather diiiicult to he prompt. This
necessitates considerable i stiiihancc
in the seating or many late coniers
and breaks into the harmony of tho
service [or those who come on time
There is nothing in our college hit»
that is doing more to hring the overt
age student who is a regular attend
out or these services more into ‘lltll'r
mony with the host in tho woild illilll
the Vesper service. A caroiul alien-
tion to some at the dctni ooonerioii
with it, \l ill do much to make it till an
even larger place in the li or those
wllo attend.

What a. small appreciation some mem-
bers of the community have ot‘ the op-
pnrtunity that is theirs. Those mem-

in view oi the present keen intei-esl

hedged ahout hv limitations which
make it a mere lllsl. resource. Such a
change would also satisiv those who
want a more spectacular contest than
the present rules encourage.”

From the Daily Pllllcelouian: “But

Care must he exercised not to let the

“I don't like this idea at the raise in
prices tor the entertainments given by
the different college organizations,”
said a Senior this morning. “lVllen i
first came toci-iiincll sevsiiti ivc cents
was the general admission pi ice to the
concerts and plays. Last year this
was raised to one dollar. It seems to
me that all orguii tioiis giving enterr
tainments would do well to cut down
expenses to the point where the old
price would he adequate. The lower
the cost of strictly student activities
the more general the participation in
them and the more satisfactory will be
the conditions of college lire."

"I Wish there was some means oi
keeping a full account of some of the
chapel talks we have had this year,"
said a regular chapel attendant the
other day. “In years to collie, if we
could only read over these talks. what
a line experience would he in store for
us. Those we have heard this year are
well worth keeping in a permanent
term.”
