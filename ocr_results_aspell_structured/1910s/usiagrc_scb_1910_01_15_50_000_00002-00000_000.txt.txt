Al: honor “G" club lads heen sue
ge'sted tor Grinnell. In other institu-
tions the men who have won the ntlr
letic emblem are frequently organized
.lnto a club. If there are those with
sultieient interest and time to
on the work or such an nl'gonl'
Grinnell it might aecompl some
good. It is something to think about
'at any rate.

These responsible for the operation
of the heating plant are certainly to
be commended for the excellent man
her in which the buildings about the
cammls have been kept harm so for
this whiter. No one need stay away
from the chapel se ice for fear the
building will he cold, it the past leiv
Weeks is any indication of the way
it will be warmed in the future, The
students appreciate the excellent work
which is being done.

THE 3.4 D.

For the tirst time in a number of
‘years the hand has been organized on
a basis that promises to he permanent.
This year there has been more than
Ithc usual amount ot good material
'present in the college ad with the HSA

‘good band by spring. Another year
with continued otiort the orgnui 'ttiotl

SEMESTER REVIEWS.

In two weehs the wort: or the iirst
halt of the college 3 or will be about
completed. So for apparently the only
practical means of clash-t: such a ne-
rlod or Work seems to he by uiittan
reliews done under high lil'l‘ksm'n rm.

‘ deniahly had as the s stem is, a more
sensible attitude toward these re-
views would go tar to improve collrllr
tlons. That some people uor them
selves into a rather pronounced I‘o n
of hysteria at such times, is no credit
either to the college or themselves,

For the present at least, all the stu-
dents ot the college must take part in
this work. Such being the case. tuo
things can he done which will bring
a much more wholesome atmosph -e
to the Grinnell campus at the close
of the semester:

1. Prepare now by c -eiully planning
the Work of the next two weeks
, 2. When the time comes write to

' the hest of your ability and target the
grade. Every student who has done
his work has the one essential thing
the course ottersso bcttcr ability to
do, and a wider appreciation of the
great roots of life. A blank paper
might be a far more eloquent state
ment than eight pages oi closely writ-
ten copy.

FOR A LIBRARY.

Many students in the college look
forward to the time when they will
have a library that will be a source ol‘
comfort and pleasure to them. For
the actlve life demanded today there
is no more certain comfort and no
more needed balance than that which

A HIGH HONOR.

Again a Grillnell man has brought
recognition to his Alma Mater in the
that of his selection as the next Rhodes
scholar at Oxford from Iowa. Grinnell
sent the first man train Iowa to enioy
the privileges ol study in a great Ellis
lish university. It is gratifying to
note that just five years from the
time our first representative wont,
Grinnell is again to be represented.

Ziegler has hrot as great rccognition
to the college for its Work in training
men, as any student can bring at this
time. For this tact and [or the fact
of his Root] fortune, the Scarlet and
Black extends the congratulntions and
