E' ‘ DECORUEI
1-25” PRO PA‘I‘RIA Mom

The college inourns profoundly and
sincerely the logs e; the seven men
ivho gave tip their lives while in serve
ice here. The death of these lads,
who we“: just on the threshold of
their college life, has totlched tis
deeply more deeply than is possible
oi e. pt-cssion.

They were part c: the vast army 01'
men who have given their lives while
in service. No less than the lads in
France and Flanders, they were serv-
ing for their country’s sake. They died
hatt'ling against a foe mighty as shall—
fire or gas.

In remembering them, the faculty
has a warm appreciation ol their co-
operation and service, a'nd their coin-
panions, a memory of tried friendship
and unselﬁsh devotion to duty. They
'tvere good soldiers, brave gentlemen,
and trusted friends.

men of the s. A. T. c. last Saturday
morning is published elsewhere in this

The desire for a college education
is inherent in every young man who is
awake to the nceds and opportunities
ot the hour. Those men who entered
college last fall tor the ﬁ t time
should plan to continue this year's
Work. he old men are eager to do
so. They lincw \vhaL Grinncll means,
the opportnni rs and p ileges she
