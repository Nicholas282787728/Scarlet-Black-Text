Beans Organize

Another "onery" society has been
organized for the senior girls. The
Ivory Dome Society sprang up full-
grown in a single night.

Absolutely no qualiﬁcations are nec»
essary for membership in this organi-
zation. One simply belongs. The great
mystery of the society is, "How one
knows she belongs." This secret is
cherished carefully by all the meme
hers and will he handed down from
generation to generation.

Rumors of scholarship qualiﬁcations
merely show how well the real secret
hits been guarded thus far. lndignant
members deny that scholarship has
any connection whatever with the ore
genization and scoff at the notion that
thirty hours of c and ten hours of D
are required, as some of the envious
have suggested.

The Ivory Dome society has estab-
lished a precedent of energetic, instan-
taneous organization which threatens
to shatter one of the seasoned tradie
tions of Grinnell.

DRAFTED MEN WILL BE
TRAINED AT WISCONSIN

Between 2,500 and 5,000 drafted men
will be stationed on the campus for
training this spring and summer, if
present plans mature. They will study
in the university laboratories, shops
and class-rooms some of the technical
work for their military service calls.
They will probably live in temporary
barracks, and of course be in uniform
and on government pay. It is prob-
able that a similar plan will be ca
i-ied out at each of several universities

matter by the goierninent so far.

CHRISTMAN IS IN
CHEMICAL PLANT

Works in Proximity to Large Vats
of Nitroglycerine

The following paragraphs are taken
from a letter written by Adam Christ-
nian '17, who is now in the government
chemical department at Dover, N. J

“I am supposed to be in charge of
the solvents that come into the lab
oratory, but I have two other fellows
trained to do all the work, and am
usually roaming around the plant,
picking up all the information I can,
and rubbing elbows with the ‘wops.’
‘Wop' is a‘ class name for cheap labor
that isn't cheap, and in the last analy—
sis is not even labor. You have to
cultivate the ‘wops' to get along with
them,

“It is appalling to a newcomer to
go into a nitroglycerine neutralizing
house and see the deadly fluid come
pouring down into the neutralizing
vat thru lead troughs. It is beyond
my imagination to conceive what
would happen if some slight jar were
to set off a vat of nitroglycerine."

Gi'l'nnell's basketball team faces
what will probably be the hardest
game of the entire season when they
meet Ames at Ames Friday afternoon.

All available dope does not give a
balance in favor of either side. Ames
since winning the game on the local
ﬂoor has been beaten by Iowa and
Kansas. In the Iowa game the Ames
team only made one ﬁeld basket, scor-
ing the remainder of their nine points
on free throws by Aldrich, The local
team since the Ames game has beaten
Coo twice and lost one game to Cor-

Team in Good Condition

The scarlet and black quintet is in
good condition, having come through
the two games last week without any
injuries which would deter any of the
men from playing in their respective
places on Friday. In all probability
the same lineup will start the game
Friday as started the game at Cornell
last week—Hammond and Garner at
the forward positions, Augustine at
center, Sewer: and Cass. guards.

Sinners Will Throw Fouls

Hard practice has been instituted
by Coach MacEachron during the ﬁrst
part of the week. snort passes and
short shots have been used with telle
ing effect on the freshman in the score
book. Hammond seems to have ac—
quired a. new eye for baskets, judging
by the way he was tossing them thru
the ring at practice last night? Som-
crs will be the mainstay from the foul
line, having shown more ability there
than anyone else when under ﬁre,

One week from Friday the strong
Cornell team will be met on the home
ﬂoor, and a fast, hard game is exA
Dected.

ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES
NEARLY DEPUPULATEI]

Masefield Says the Only Students
Are Men Who Are Unﬁt
for Service

That the universities of England
have become almost entirely depopur
latcd within the last three years, ex—
cept for a few wounded soldiers, men
who have been rejected for service, and
a small iiuiiiher who are too young to
enlist, was the statement of John
Maseﬁeld, the English poet, who lec-
tured here last Saturday, in a special
interview granted to a Scarlet and
Black reporter,

Universities, such as Oxford. which
had an attendance of 4,000 students
before the outbreak of the war, now
have scarcely more than 200, accord-
ing to Mr Masefield. Practically all
of this reduced attendance took place
before the draft went into effect, near-
ly every ablerbodied man having en-
listed during the ﬁrst year of the war.

“'oiucn Curry 01] Work

Notwithstanding this, the conscripts
of the British army- have never been
looked down upon by the volunteers.
but have always been considered on an
equal footing with the first men to
enter the war in England.

The women of the United Kingdom
have cutered nearly every branch of
work which was carried on before the
war by inch alone, Mr. Maseﬁeld tic-
clared, Aside from becoming agricule
turists, they are working in nearly ev-
ery department of the munitions fac-
tories, and many have become skilled
mechanics.

ll'ollle Gather Oltl )[etnl
One of the principal occupations in

.which women have become engaged is

the gathering of old metal receptacles
from all over England, boiling and
sterilizing them, and manufacturing
them into various kinds of implements.
Mr Maseﬁeld paid a high tribute to
Norman Hall '10.
Story itcbenel"s Mob,” was one of
the truest and most. exact pictures of
trench life which he had ever read.

Criticism of the social life, and sug~
gesticns for modiﬁcation, are at pres
