service in which many Grinncll and
college people are interested is that
of col. Charles M. Saltzman to the
rank or Brigadier General.

General saltzman was horn at
Panol'a. Iowa. and graduated irom
the Pal-lore. schools when H. A. Field.
or this city. was principal. and later
from the Guthrie County High School.

Mr. Saltzman was a good student
and a capahle young man. much
above the average in enterprise and
trustworthiness. When a mere boy
he learned telegraphy in the Panora
station, just for ion. and used to
spend much of his spare time in the

charge Well. he tooli good care of
the business and stood in well with
the road oiticials. Notwithstanding
this he found time to play ball and
the quite young he was a good player
and a good pitcher.

His work in the station was so
well donc that he was ottered a place
in the Wabash station at Des Moines.
where he worked several months and
during vacation.

In late he entered Grinncll College.
expecting to take a course here. hut
was tempted to take an examination
in the spring oi 1880 for West Point.
ranking first and receiving the alps
pointment from Congressman Hull.
There was no politics in it, just
merit.

While in Grinnell he proved popu-
lar in college, standing well in class.
playing ball. taking part in literary

for he was a bright talker, and
as sting at the Rock Island fl ight
station, as beiore for the fun of it.

While here he hoarded and zoomed
at lurs. Hibbnl‘d‘s in the home now
occupied by D- March Green.

At West Point. he attended to husiv
ness. as a cadet did as the upper
class men told him to do. blacked
their boots when told to do so, and
as he told the writer, once. got along
ﬁnely, He graduated. entered the
army and served in Cuba. He soon
became an expert in signal and telcr
phone work and an authority on ﬁeld
telephones when the system was now.
He was promoted to captain. then
major, then colonel, and now holds
the ranking otiicer in the Signal
Corps.

We last met General Saltzman
three years ago at the reunion oi
graduates oi the Guthrie County High

School at Panora and he was the
same genial. [run-hearted, delightful
man which made him iricnds when a
boy.

Always genial, true. honest and
industrious. he earned his promo
lions and his tricnds of thc boy in
the eighties are proud of the success
ol the man now.

Mr. Saltzniaii is about it: years old.
and owes much to his "bringing up."
His rather, "Joe" Saltzinan, now lies
ccascd, was enc ot the rare men oi
