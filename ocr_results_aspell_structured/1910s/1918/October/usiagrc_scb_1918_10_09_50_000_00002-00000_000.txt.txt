The beginning of a year is always
thought to be the time tor decisions,
There is the old tradition or “New
Year Resolutions . When the old year
with its Iailures and mistake s be-
hind us, we can, in eilcct, stait anew.
We can make our plans ior another
and a hotter year without the discoine
farting rememhrnncc that we are hot
continuing something. We can put ere
erythiug in the background All that
is ahead is untried, and unspoiled.

In a very real sense tl is the be
ginning oi a new year. Everything
is hetero us. There is the challenge
ot the unexpected and the joy oi the
unknown. The old college years are
behind us, in this pressing time, are
tor-gotten. We hare entered a new col-
lege in a new year. To you who are
freshmen there is the chance tor reso-
lutions, tor putting into expression all
the ideals that belong to a college and
its lite. To thc upper-classmen comes
the chance to correct what they hare
iountl talse and unworthy.

Now is the time to decide what you
are going to make or this year—
o-helher you will “Ilnnk it" or whether
you will make this year worthy of he-
ing rcincmhercd. It , a year full oi
promise. Are you going to put into
it youi host—in pork and play and
inﬂuence? .\ ikc this year your best.

Saturday C lzl‘cll begins her toot-
hall son. The lillerlip is new. The
men hare practiced under dilticultics
hccansc oi lack of time. They are
meeting a team whose strength they
do not know.

But the old Grlnllell tight in c ,
man on the team. They are all go—
ing out to win. All Giiiinell must
he hack or them.
and show the team we
them.

Evcl iody out, and show what the
old Gi-innell football spirit is, Every—
body out car the game Saturday—
ttntl root for the Scarlet and Black.

We thought about a little poem we
read somewhere as we splashed oil to
class ’slnorning:

The rain it raineth on the just

And on the unjust fellas—
Bnt mostly on the just

Because the unjust have the justs'
