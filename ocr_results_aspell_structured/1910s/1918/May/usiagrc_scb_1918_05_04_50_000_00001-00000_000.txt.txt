Dmmatist’s Nature Is Revealed
From Eight Different
Sta-ndpoints

AS PROPHET, ADVOCATED
IDEAS OF IMPORTANCE NOW

Believed in Nobility of Character
and Not of Money, Talent
., or Birth

Ibsen as a man, a painter, a poet, a
prose wri er, a play wright, a patriot,
a preacher, a pessimist, and a prophet,
was the subject of a lecture by Fl’ufes-
sor w. H. Sclloﬁelrl at the chapel hour
Friday morning.

In describing Ibsen the nan, Pro
lessor seliorield gave a brief history ot
his pic.
dirced his ﬁrst play, “Catalina," at the
age ot 13 while an apprentice in an
apotlrecary shop, The work met with
no success and the edition which he
had been forced to seek help to pro-
ducc served to wrap up pius anti nc
tiles at the corner grocer-y. "Th
iu-or-lr, holllevel'," said protessor Schoa
ﬁeld, ”contained the germs or great
ness oi his later works.“

Left Norway at, do

At the age oi so he lctt Norway and
sailed r'or Italy with his tarnily arid a
capital stock or two hundred dollar-
altho he spent 27 years away from
home, “he became a truer Norwegian
as he saw it in perspective."

His death in 1906 marked the entl of
a tile which exempliﬁed the tr-agical
contrast ‘ between achievement and
happiness.

"In appearance,” said Protessor
Schorield, “he was short, stocky and
suggestive of sell-control and will
power.” His great care of details anti
regiila ty ot habits were other char--
acter ti s w ich were emphasized.

w 'IIO‘I to Be Artist

Ibseu’s hrst desire u as to he an art-
ist," said Proies or Sclioﬁeld. “He
had an instinct for details and was a
caretul strident of phy cal setting."
The magniﬁcence of nature attracted
him. .

As a playwright . sen led the stage,
He was not led by it," said Professor-
Schoheld. ”We are all ghosts haunted
by old, dead opinion," was one of II)»
seu‘s thoughts.

As a patriot Ibsen was a citizen ot
the world "His love or country was
only a transition state," explained
Protcssor Schoﬁcld. He had no conﬁr
deircc in the masses and believed that
democracy made the state plebeiau.
In this connection Professor Schoﬁeld
remarked, "This war is to malrc the
world sate tor democracy. We may
have to ﬁght another one to make deni-
ocracy sate for the World.”

\l'a I’het or Truth

As a preacher. Ibsen stood out
against social sham. “I is great dread
was the lie," was the statement ot
Professor Schoﬁeld, "He was above
all the. poet ot truthtuliiess."

As a pessimi ~t. Ibsen said of himsclt,
“I do riot believe in the perpetuity oi
any human ideal, but I do belic e in
the perpetuity of THE ideal." “IIe lie-
li veil that one must always shatter

- idea -, put that one inirst also have
the ideal ever peter-e him," explained
Protes or Schoﬁcld. “Heaven and
earth shall pass away, but are ideal
shall not pass away," said Ibsen.

As a prophet, Ibsen advocated wom—
cirs rights long lictoro the movement
gained popular recognition. lie bca

BELOI’I‘, \vis., nay 3.~Eelmt coir

The tri-mesters will terminate l‘eSDCc»

As a v, ar measure it will enable airy
students who are called or desire to
help out in the labor shortage which
occurs upon the terms in the spring
and summer, to leave at the end or a
completed course instead
with the courses unﬁnished. It will
also enable them to return and take
up their work again, exactly where
they left on.

in connection with the summer
school term, wh n will be equivalent
to a tr niester, any students so desir
irig will be enabled to complete thcii
college education in three years \v‘lLllv

quality of the work involved. This is
a great advantage to many students

Iy advantageous during the war as it
will allow some young men to grodir

In connection with the change in the
length of the terms, Belolt has adopted
a new class schedule system. It is a
block system or tour recitatioiis a

three classes held on alteiiiatc days.
This is being done in order to carry on
