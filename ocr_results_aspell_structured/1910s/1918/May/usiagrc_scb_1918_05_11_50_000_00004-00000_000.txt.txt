THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Cyclone Turns
Cold Shoulder

Displeased With Last Reception,
It Furnishes Conversation
But No Excitement

Now i don't want to worry you
toll at all but the barometric pres-
sure is the lowest that it has been
since the cyclone iii 1ss2. 1 don't
witnt you to worry, you understand,
but it loohs like we were due tor a
cyclone that will hlow you ott the face
of the earth in about teir minutes."
This was the chcerlul news that was
handed around Grinnell Thursday
evening arid has since been veriﬁed
by hartliug an Nuckolls.

They report that their barometer
stood at 28.29 in. while normal for
this altitude is .00 in. While not
prepared to say whether or not it
was the lowest pressure since the
cyclone, Mr. Niieliolls says it is the
lowest he has en in the tcir years
he has been oh, rring it.

But so tar as ihc cyclone iias can»
eerncd Gr' ircll wasn't on ilre map
and it pa. ed on without hardly so
much in way or courtesy as to blow
dust iir our faces. Possibly it is still
sore about the reception it got the
last time it was here,

It is said, yoir know, that the town
turned iii instead of out on the some
sion. Then again it might have heen
icenrinced that the .lunio - could do
‘a better job or wrecking than it could
‘hope to accomplish. One thing oni-
tilltly iriend did [or us all unconscious—

IL put new Dell in the weather as a
topic or conversation. No one can say
that they were bored by the subject
Thursday night. Many were keenly
;oisappeinted in the Cyclones failure
to piit iii an appearance. They had
beg‘i to trope that something r ally

ting and out oi the ordinary might
some day occur in Grinnell.
