Says ‘Ragtime’ Has Come to Play
Distinctive Part in Our
National Life

“Community singing is beginning to
liaie a real place in Am ~ietiii lite,"
said Prof. H, \l'. liatlaek in an inter-
view this morning.

Protessoi- Alallack, who is president
of the state Inuslf. tCaCllC S’ {ISSOCIHV
tioll, gave a tail: on this.subicct at the
annual convention or the association
in Des Monies reeentli.

some Upholds )Ioriile

"The realization oi the need of more
singing is being brought by the pres-
eiit war," Protessor natlaek eontinitcd.
“Song is the best uzty oi upholding the
morale oi the eoimtiy."

“Those songs that we used to call
‘l'agtime' now play a distinctive part
in our national lite. Before the war
this light type at music was held in
disdain by many musical authorities.
who are now advocating its univei al
use. Such songs as ‘Dl'cr Theie‘ will
put more men mm the top' than any-
thing else 1 know of. it encourages
men over there, so why should not
popiilai songs pitt our home enter-
prises and, ammo all, our spirit cone
cerning the war, over the top?"

Is Drill in lionie’ Camps

“Camp authorities have realized the
need ot outside iaetors to keep up the
spirit of their.lnen," Protessor Matlack
continued. He cited the rule torcing
men to attuntl song drill at Camp
Dodge. “Leaders perform on plattorm
like our yellrleatlers at our toothall
games," he added.

“Community singing,” he said in
conclusion, “is only song drill in the

, great home camps, where it is just as
necessary as in m itary camps that
the morale he maintained.”
