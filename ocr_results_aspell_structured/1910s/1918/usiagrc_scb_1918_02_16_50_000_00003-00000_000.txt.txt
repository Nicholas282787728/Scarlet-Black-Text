Professor H. S. Canard Discovers
Productivity and Food
Value of Soy Bean

Professor H. S. Canard, in conduct-
ing a series of experiments recently
before the Naturc Study club, has deny
.onstrated that the soy-bean, formerly
a product only of the far East, can be
cultivated in this country as an excel-
lent meat substitute,

The bean contains 20 per cent fat
and 40 per cent protein. It is so ricti
that at the supper given by the Nature
study chili, the members fniiiid they
had eaten enough protein for two
meals. or, according to some stand-
ard for :1 Whole day.

Cost Is Law

In this country the soy-bean sells
at ten cents a pound, in contrast with
the navy been at 20 cents, containing

'only half the amount of protein. in
fact, this vegetable furnishes four
times as much (or the money.

It far surpasses the navy bean in
productivity, for a single soyrbeau will
produce from 40 to 100 seeds. It is
adapted to wet or dry soil, to warm or

 

cold climate. Two hundred variet‘ s
have been cultivated in China and in-
pan for ages past. To some extent
the soy-bean has been cultivated tor
enriching the soil in the southern
states of this eountt Tun or three
varieties will mature in Iowa.

. Uscll for Oil

The U. s. Department at Agriculture
is pushing the plan for the increased
cultivation and use of this product. in
the for East, besides its food value,
the bean furnishes oil for cooking pur-
poses, and is manufactured into a bean
curd.

Manchuria last year had a. million
tons of soyrbeans for sale at one cent
a pound on December 1. One shipload
0! this cargo has recently reached San
Francisco for distribution.
