aiilc regret that students. {acuity and
alumni alike witness this change, be-
cause or the exceptionally high stand-
ard upon which the retiring manage-
ment has placed the paper, Very low
strident publications in the west, in
tact, in the 9111' e countr , have been
raised so high in the estimation oi all
three classes as has The Scarlet and
Black during the past year. two do irot
be. into in saying that the 1917-13
Scarlet and Black has been on a par
with or even better than any college
newspaper in the United states. and
that it has certainly rrcvct- been ex-
celled by any Griimell publication.

giron the student body air opportunity
to esprcss itsclr on various questions

A now system or news gathering
has boon instituted, that or “inns,” or-
“beats,” instead ot a

city da s, and is even now being
copied trom Griiinell by other collegc
papers. The business idc, too, has
progressed out of all proportions to

it is with gcriuinc regret that we

Black’s only aim to he a newspaper,
and a lle\lspapcr [rec fl'alll Sensation-

rt corrospond to thc rulcs oi tho great

We hope thr'rt our r’clatioir rip with
the student body will be as cordliilrtts

is just retiring, and it is oirr dcsirc
that we may canopcltitc with tho incr—

have the rot rrrg minor and business
manager, ioi- we intend to support
them at all times.

Tho coming roar will be oirc oi the
liar-dost, it riot the hardest, in the his»

conditions will bring about problems
which we have never bctor-c irrct, and
which, iii their very nature, will he
