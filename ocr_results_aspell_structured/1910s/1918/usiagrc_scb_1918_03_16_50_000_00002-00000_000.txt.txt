SOCIAL LIFE.
(rroiu ilir Monmouth Oracle)

One of the prime Iunctions oi the
college is, supposedly to so cultivate
the social side of its students that
when they 'get out into the wolld they
will he marked by their ahility to sur—
roiind‘theiiisolvcs with a distinctive
social atmosphere, to meet people ct
all classes and to feel at ease in any
society. and to conduct themselves
with social poise no matter what the
situation.

Well and good, but from the college
side we pick up exchange alter exr
change, with laiiienta ‘ons and more
lanicntations about the inadequacy oi
the social {system in the various col-
leges. One live college paper from a
live school reminds its readers that
their college has outg wn the “hack.
water college" stage, and inust find
forms or social expression consistent
with the advance. No less than three
or our exchanges have come out with
thoro editorials on this Subject since
our last issue, and this is but an ex—
ample of the gelieial condition re-
necting itself through college papers.

We have ahout come to the con-
clusion that social life will take care
or, itselt when young men and young
women are thrown together in the
average co-educationai college if (and
me in lies the secret; IF the loims or
leg mate social life open to .young
people are not siibiect to niohihitory
rules on the. part ot the particular col-
lege‘ author ies, and just to the ex-
tent to which legitimate forms of so»
cial life are interfered with is the so-
cial lite (inadequate. Of course all
hangs on the interpretation oi the
word “legitimate." ,

with a streak oi luck that would put
Dame Fortune herself to shame, won
from the red and gold quintet by a
score of 2i-2l. The game was one of
the cleanest, iastcst and hardest

playing, the game uas decidedly iii

Professor Hendrixson said that three
people could save enough ti-oni their
daily rations to iecd one soldier and
yet keep in the host physical condition.
if this is true. it is time we were i‘indr

duce the amount oi iood consumed and
perhaps increase proportionately the
amount 0f \VitLelI used.
