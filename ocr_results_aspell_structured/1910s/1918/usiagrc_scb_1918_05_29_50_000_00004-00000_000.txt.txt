Plauvlus Lunks Wilh Favor
[in Galdenels and Small Boys

Pluvlus, the god or rain certainly
has been favoring the ga' ‘
and the small lads in the vi
girls are wondering how on "earth”
they are going to get their twelve

hours at gardening in belore examv

time. Mr. Conard has his microscope
ready to discern between the onions
and the weeds. But nothing bothers
the small boys. They are spending all
of their spare time swimming around
over the top 0: the rhubarb plants in
the “Swimming hole" that covers the
southwest corner of the college gard-
on.

Seriously, very much damage has
been done to the garden by the heavy
rains of the last two Weeks. The
road makes it impossible to keep the
Weeds back. Moreover, no little
amount of worrying is being done by
the girls who need from 6 t0 8 hours
more 0! work in order to earn their
gym point.

The resident alumnae of the Calo-
cagathian literary society entertained
the members of the present society
very delightfully at the H. W. Matiack
home on Friday afternoon. Although
the weather conditions prevented an
outdoor party as had been planned, the
many who attended enjoyed a very
pleasant time in the house and on the
porch. Light rclreshrnents were serv—
ed.
