In a slow game, marked by roughr
ness and-loose handling or the hall,
the varsity began the season Saturdar
evening by defeating the treshmen ﬁve
with a 27 to 11 count. This contest
was substituted for the Carleton game
which was scheduled for that time

The first half ended with the score
12 to 5 in favor oi the varsity, and
their lead was never threatened. Gar-
iier, at forward, led both teams in me
dividual scoring, making a total of six
ringers. Evans was the best scorer
for the freshmen, making four or their
five ﬁeld goals, besides ringing one
tree throw.

The ti-eshmep were at a disddvam

game, as the game was not arranged
until the crowd began to or re im-
the Carleto- contest. They were care
less about their team work and about

considerably. The line-up:

The Carleton ﬁre started the game
with a rush and betore the spectators
could realize what had happened they
had rung up four points. Hammond
then made two free throws, and Sour-
ei-s, who played a wonderful game
thruout, added pop to the local ﬁve by
tossing two ﬁeld goals in rapid suc-
cession, At no time (1- ing this stage
of the game was either team tar in the
lead and when the hair closed the
Grinnell team was one point ahead.
Play in the second halt was as close
as in the ﬁrst, with both teams guard»
ing better and forcing the forwards to
make long attempts at the basket
which otten went wild For a tune it,
looked as it the visitors were going to
win as they spurted and took the lead
lrom the local ﬁve. This lei-id was out
down when Hammond threw a ﬁeld
basket aiter the ball had been worked
down the ﬁeld to a point directly be~
ucatli the Gl'innel goal. With one
point needed to tie, a foul was called
on a Carleton player and “Pitt” threw
the basket atter time had been called.
Ciedit must be given the Carleton
men tor the brand oi basketball they
displayed. They were heavier and
more rangy than the Grinnell men and
made good use ol‘ this advantage.

“The greatest freedom is the volunr
tat-y yielding of personality to all the
great loyalties and obligations of hu-
man life," declared Professor J. D.
Stoops in his vespei- address last Sun-
day.

He stated that the social pressure or
the war would do away with the po
Sillilil)’ that any student in college
could he a water or he dissatisﬁed.

“The great st thing re who stay at
home can do," he said, is to organize
our thinking and l g so that We Will

present or iii the coming tin . The
only 1' 'ﬁcation we have these day
is in homes, ng up our will to the
fundamental loyalties for which men
