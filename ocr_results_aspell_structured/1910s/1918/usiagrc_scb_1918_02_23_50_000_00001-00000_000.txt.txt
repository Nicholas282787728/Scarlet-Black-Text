Albert, King of the Belgians, tlic citi.

King Albert‘s chief quallﬁcalioh to
the throne, according to Rev. Hzlyr
wood, was the intimate, ﬁrsthand
knowledge which he had of his peer

from a book, he put on overalls and

Kaiser \ sits Belgium

In 1912. tivo years after King Ale
bert's coronation, the Kaiser paid a
visit to Belgium. He was dressed in
his white uniform, which. the speaker
ohscrved, was as close as the Kaiser
would ever get to being an angel.

At this time he laid before Albert. in
secret session his plans for invading
France and asked permission to come
thru Belgium, “Albel s answer," said
n -. Haywood, ”was to introduce a bill
into the Belgian parliament creating a
Belgian army." The. bill, he added,
was not passed till 1913, giving the
Belgian army which opposed the Gel»
mans just one year of training.

llad Tu» Alteruati as

In 1914, King Albert knew that he
had two alternatives. Either he must
throw every ounce of the military
power of his country in the path of
the German army and see his country
destroyed. or he could yield to the
wishes of the Kaiser, who promised
that in such event “not a single pear
in the Belgian orchards would be
touched "

Fomer Assistant of Hoover in

Conservation Talk

“Starvation of the entente has done
more for Germany in two years- of the
war than force of arms could have ac-
complished in ten years."

This declaration, quoted from a high
German niilitaiy authority. was made
by in. John B, Lord. a member of the
Belgian Relief Comm on, who has
worked under the direction of H P.
Hoover, America's food administrator,
in the United States and Belgium, at a
chapel address Thursday. The speech
was tlic ﬁrst at a s ties of lectures on
food conservation which will be ‘deliv-
t-rcd before Grlnuell students at regu-
lar intervals up to March 19.

“Starvation has been Germany's
greatest weapon in the war," he cone
tinned. “So effective has it proved
that families in many iegions of
France are forced lo subsist on one
and two~fllsh meals, with bread and
ehccsc their principal article of diet.”

The Clying need for food has led
them to invent a bread which is com-
posed of 70% whole wheat ﬂour and
30% of ﬂour made from potatoes, oats,
rye, corn and barle.

PROGRESS OF MEDICAL
SCIENCE IS VIVIDLY
PICTUWIECTORE

The Value of Bacteriology and
Anti-Toxins Is Explained
by Dr. J. W. Clark

PRES, S. P. POWELL OF
‘ HOBART COLLEGE SPEAKS

Compares Fighting of Fire to
Fighting Germany at This
Critical Time

Di .l W. Clark, professor in the
Po 'cllmc in Chicago, gave an address
Friday afternoon on ”The Golden Age
of Medlehl Science."

“We take the marvels of today's
science for granted," he said, "but let
us step back into the late s . es of the
last century and sec the conditions ex-
isting at that time."

Luck of Prom Thou

Dr. Clark then pictured the lack of
progress in medical science at that
time, when a compound fracture meant
almost invariably an amputation, when
diphtheria canted oft whole families,
and when hospitals were regarded not
as curative places, but merely as reb
tiges for people who were too poor to
be cared for in their own homes.

i “During the Civil War he contin—
ued, “suonu cut of every 30,000 ty-
phoid fever victims lost their lives
from that disease. Today, among the
$0,000 in the allied armies who have
the disease, scarcely IDO men lose
their lives. This remarkable reduction
in the death rate is due to the results
of iacciuation.

The EHIIL' hxpcrimcnts

He told in some detail the thrilling
story of early experiments which has
sulted in the new science or bactcriob
ogy. “More and more anti—toxins are
gradually being discovered," he said,
“and much is to be hoped from recent
studies of leprosy, tuberculosis and
the hook» m'm,"

Dr. Cla ,- told the story of the disc
cm’ei‘y of the cause of yellow level-
when a commission of brave men, hav.
ing satisﬁed themselves of the cause
of the disease, proved to the world
by sleeping with yellow fever patients
and by wearing their unwashed cloth-
ing, that the disease is transmitted
only by the mosquito.

history will honor These

“Sallie day," said Dr. Claik, “writers
of history will devote lcss space to
Caesar and his wars and will accord
such men as the members of this
conu sion the place which they de-
ser e.’

After Dr. Clark's lecture, President
.uaiu called to the platform President
s, P. Powell of Hobart college, New
York, who has recently returned train
a visit to the wcstcru Ii-ont.

l’l' ‘NII'III rowell Talks

"Fellow and uuhyplieuated citizens,"
rrcsideut Powell began, “when your
house is on ﬁre you do not stop to
wonder what caused it. You put that
fire out. Uncle Sam is ﬁghting be
cause he has tremendous cause. No
one can fail to see the issue.

“Germany is going to be beaten,” he
continued, “because she is not worthy
oi her enemies, She seems to know
ere ythiug and understand nothing.

thing which makes us put it across."

Co. C Pays Tribute to
Men Leaving for Camp

In order to pay a ﬁtting tribute to
the men who have been drafted from
Poweshick county, and who left this
morning for Camp Dodge, Company C
of the college battalion marched to
the station and stood at pr -cnt arms
while the train pulled out,

A large crowd of Griunell people
