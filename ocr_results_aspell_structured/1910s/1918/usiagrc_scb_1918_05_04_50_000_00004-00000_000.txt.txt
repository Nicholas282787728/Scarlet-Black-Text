Schoﬁeltl Shows Inﬂuence of Wal-
lace and Bruce Biographies
in Scotland

The inllucnce ot literary biography
on shaping the destinies or people and
nations, was the feature of :1 lecture
on old Scottisll literature delivered by
Prof, 1 . Sehotield iii the auditorium
of alumni recitation hall Friday cve~
nlng.

“Biography," he said, “perpetuates
the ideals of a nation.” In illustrate
‘ing this he cited Washington and Lili-
eolil in this country and Bruce and
Wallace in Scotland,

Professor Schoﬁeld showed how the
conception of such men's characters
are not trile conceptions out idealized
ones. Our idea ot Washlngton, he
pointed out, is gained from a parson' 5
book urittcn for Sunday School pul-
noses
Eliibotli Itlmll' in Men

"All nations," he said 'enihotly their
ideals in certain men. The details or
their character are changed aiid the
ideal zed character is accepted as
true.“ Bruce and Wallace hold this
place iii Scottish histo
' The conceptions of the characters of
these two men was gained trom two
biographies, one by John Barber of
Bruce, the other by unknown author of
.Wnllace. “These two hooks have
transierlned Scottish history," he dc-
claret].

Barber he described as the m‘chdea»
ccn of Aberdeen, an amiable mall with
high ideals. Scotland was crude in
those days and the book was tor the
purpose or teaching the youth lessons
in chivalry and patriotism.

Is R001: 01' "lite

The life of Wallace, Professor Scho-
ﬁeld presented as a long, bitter story.
Instead of being written by Harry, the
1; 'nd hard, as popularly supposed,
Protessor Schoﬁeld said that there was
no doubt that it was written by a
sophisticated court poet.

The hook was written in the light of
political events and as political propae
ganda "it is written in a spirit of
hate, revenge and cruelty and has done
an incredible amount of harm," stated
,Pi‘otessor Schoﬁeld.

in contrast to this work of hate.
Protessor Schofleld presented the “Im-
itation of Christ," written by Thomas
a Kempis, which existed at the same
time. "This book," he said, “was the
tavorite ot the present Kn -er Wil-
hclm's father, whereas \Vilhelm's fa—
vorite author is Machiavell ”

CALLS CHAUCER
THE .“LOVE POET”

Schoﬁeld Lands Personality of the
Early English Writer

"Chaucer, the love poet, the benign
poet, beloved of all and enemy ot
none," was the theme or Prot. w. 1'
Schodcld's lecture in alumni auditor
um Thursday evening.

. l-lc contrasted him with Dante, lio
poet to reverence, while Chaucer is
the poet to love, because [ion] the‘ he-
simnns to the end of his works he
had the same glad personality. “He
is. because he is, and we accept him as
such, as a godsend,” he said,

"Next to his cha- ctcr, his style is
the (Lung that linger ., he continued,
“for it melody itself. His “Tr [us
and ci-essioa" is more artistic and sun-
tle than anything ever attempted in
English."

He ch ractcrized the portraiture of
Clutucers “Conterbul Tales" as one
ot- the ﬁnest hits of literature given to
the world, for the poet was gouially
and conrteonsly interested in the trail-
ties or people. in Professor sehoheld's
words, "He was fond of the heating,
pulsating life or human beings,"

The deeper side of Chaucer's nae

ture is found in his philosophy of lite.
he stated, tor truth is the great word
that runs through all his work,
» ‘He is a man who has not only writ
ten enchanting thing dehghttnl sto-
ries in a superior artistic manner, but
he is also a poet of singular swcctncss
and beauty of character, who trained
his character as he did Ills art, to
reach the goal or pcrlcction,”
