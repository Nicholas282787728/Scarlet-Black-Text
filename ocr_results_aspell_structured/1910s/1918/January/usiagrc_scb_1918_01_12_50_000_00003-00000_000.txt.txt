I Thinks Men Are
More Democratic

Mrs. Brubaker, Matron at Men’s
Dormitories, Speaks From
Personal Experience

“Men are more democratic than
girls," is the conclusion or Mrs. Brik
halier. matron of the men’s dorini-
tories. "If they have disagreements to
settle, they do it between themselves
instead of ear g the matter to some

~ one else." M .Bruhakci- was {oi-moi»
ly ehanerone in the Chi Omega house at
the University of Colorado at Boulder.

“As tar as orderliiiess is concerned
1 think they measure up very well with
the girls." she declared. his. Brue
baker mentioned that they could not
wash dishes my well, and added, in
speaking or student help, that the boys
did remarkably well considering that
many probably never had done that
kind or work betel-e.

She expressed the opinion that girls

, would not have put up with the incon~
veniences such as have been existent
in the unﬁnished condition of the
men's dormitories during the past iew
months. She says that the men are
more reasonable in their demands than
girls.

“Are they noisy? i would just as
soon have men in the house as girls."
(There were 22 girls in the sorority
house. Practically eight times that
numher are in the men’s dormitories.)

Mrs Bi-uhaher expressed no little
pleasure in being associated with the
Grinnell young people.

The Second Great
Cyclone of Grinnell

From cover to cover there is a fresh, hearty,
energetic air which is positively refreshing, and
it is to be hopedthat- the “Cyclone” will sweep
over the country in all directions, giving every
one who sees it a glimpse of the active, healthful,
earnest life of the students of Grinnell college.

That is what The Pulse stated in substance

"Otherwise it would he simply an
