When Grinncll lines up against
Drakc {or their annual football cpl]—
itcst, in the Blake stadium next Sat-
lurday it will be the twenty-third time
itheso two ancient rivals have met on
ttlie _ ' ‘ on. They met for the ﬁrst
time in the [all oi 1597 when Grinnell
ivimded the blue and while a 3&0 heat-
ing.

"lie Drake game has always been
one at the big battle. oi the football
season and has always received its
share oi attention from foot hall fans
and critics.

Drake “'ins Twelve Gaines.

l Thc records or these two teams
show that Drake has won twelve cone
tests \vllilciGl'illllell has returned vic-
tor in ten. There have been no tic
games. Altlio the Bulldogs still have
a slight advantage in victories, the
Scarlet and Black teams have been
gaining on their rivals with in
straight triumphs in as many yea
The ﬁrst oi these was the 5570 drub-
bing handed to Drake in 191a.

Seine interesting “dupe" may he
found in the scores oi prcyious yea
In the twenty-two "dross played,
[Drake has scored a total of 31?, points
to 216 for Gi-innell. The farmers his
advantage in points is due to the fact
that the Blue and White piled‘ up big
scores in some oi their better years.
‘Dl'ilkc has shut out Grinncll in nine
contests while the Scarlet and Black
teams have turned the trick six times.
‘The Bulldogs rung up the biggest
score when they won by a 57-0 count
iin 1904, Gl‘illncll's highest score was
lin the 53-0 game. in 1915.

Illlpnl'tnllt Contests.

Two of the most important contests,
at least irom the Griniiell viewpoint,
'were those at 1912 and 11115. In the

warriors triumphed over their rivals
with ~a 1370 count, breaking Dral

winning streai oi tour years' duration.
In that 5870 rout in 1915 Gi-innell
trampled on the Bulldogs with a veng-
eance alter the Blue and White had
beaten tllmn tor three straight years.
‘Practically the entire Grinnell student

 

r
'iimph. Minnesota was the only team

‘that ever defeated Drake by a larger
lscore. Another game that showed the
lold Gi-iniioll ﬁght was last year’s in
which Grinnell heat the Bulldogs 2m

.liees oi Augustine and Walt. all-state
