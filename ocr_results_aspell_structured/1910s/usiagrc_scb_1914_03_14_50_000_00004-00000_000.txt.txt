Every college girl becomes discone
tented at some lime or other, says liliss
Burner. No matter how happy or
successlul she has been lllere comes
an undeﬁned longing tor something
better and higher. Many try to satisfy
this craving with morality, but mor—
nllty is simply in accompaniment, not
an cud in lite. A purely moi-hi person
is like a stove with no lire.

others use theories, said the speaker,
and speculate about religion, This is
as dilierciit Ironl the real thing as
smelling a wild dowcr dilters irom a
wordy description or it.

Some think culture or church mem-
bership can take the place or real re~
llgion. others make the mistake of
spelling social service social service
with capitol “5’s” when it must he
simply an overﬂow ot the love in the
worker's heart.

Some people have begun all right,
but llorc not cur ’ctll it tor enough
“One does not take the advice oi n
