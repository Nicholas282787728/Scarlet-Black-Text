DDLLEDE DHDIII SINGS ANTHEM

Centering his thought about the
words, “I come not to bring peace, but
a sword” President J. IL T. Main
sounded a trumpet call to action in his
baccalaureate address to the members
of the college graduating class in the
Congregational church Sunday morn-
ing. it was a stirring presentation oi
the “divine unrest" through which civi-
lization and the cause or right are
steadily moving iorward through the
generations. it was a virile message
to right doing which stirred the prrlses
oi all who heard.

The complete test uns tound in two
passages oi scripture; irom Luho xii;
14, “Glory to God in the highest arid
on earth, peace, goodwill toward men"
and trorn ilatthew 10:34, "Think not
that i am come to send peace on earth.
I come not to send peace, but a sword."

“Nothing is ﬁnished that has tile in
it,” declared President Main in open-
ing his address. “Lite sthcsp it and
meaning oi the universe, It envelopes
and permeates the universe, Eve .
thing in the universe is incidental to
the spirit or lire."

God created the earth and ior-thwith
gave it over to man with the command
that he replenish iL and subdue it. The
world was instinct with lile, but with
life in its cruditv, Man went iorth
into the world and the ages have
witnessed his steady progress hrrt the
universe is still lull oi unsolved prob
lems. it is our task to solve these
problems. We are worlrillg out the
unending destiny or the world. We
have solved innumerable problems only
to ﬁnd greater corrirontiug us. Shall
we ever wholly subdue the “arid?
Shall we solve every problem belore us?
Never, But we shall have our vic-
tories and iii our victories we shall ﬁnd
our peace. This is the dcstini oi the
world. it s lull oi the energrc ol lite

The unﬁnished world is in the hands
oi unﬁnished man. Man himselt at
the beginning was a world equally
crude with the world he was set to
conquer, but a world full ol llossibilir

cover arid he was gileu man to dis-
cover. in this hruuan world as in the

The great temptation 01' our age is

,seuse or personal impotence hangs
like a nail in our moral heavens, and
works like an insidious disease In our
moral lives. \Ve have become com

the world in which We live, The real
nioi-al danger of onr time is that of

thinks of himself more highly than he
ought [0 think there are tell who think
of themselves more meanly than they
