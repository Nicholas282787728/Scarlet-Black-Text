is very easy to stand oii' oii Hie sidc
inns and tell how it should be done,
and quite another thing to get into the
rough and tumble or it and win a
game. lion-ever, a losing train is a dlS’
agrscahic advertisement to an insti-
tution. and sends prospective students
elsewhere. Either (iriimcll as a col-
lege should get into the spirit at the
game. or it should ahandon intercor
legiute sport and devote iiscll to other
l'orms ot athletics.
