Dear Mr. Jaqlm:

We’ve just ﬁnished our third Christ»

he is really to
start back to sclioo: again. I‘ve been
using my vacation getting caught up
in work and writing to long neglected
iriends. When you have classes twin
3 a. m. till i p. m, and are on the
athletic ﬁeld with the hors niost cvcry
day from 4 HI! 6, and ‘llhell you have
8. meeting ot‘ one sort or another every
day in the week out Dneiii'ell. by the
time you prepare your lessons, correct
papers, etc., you don't have time for
much of any thing else.

There are two American tutors here.
We are supposedly in religious \\‘orll,,
but we are so husy teaching English
:llat we have little time {or anithiiig
else. But after all, 1 expect that we
do more good or helping derelop their
oninds and hr simply- giving them the
best example at morality and honesti
that we can than by any niiinher or
sermons. .lloet ol the hois come here
with their minds deliberately closed to
all religious teachings But the
absolute conﬁdence in the Ame loans
and ti st and respect them tar ahov
their own people. And that shes us
an inﬂuence that can't help hut have
results. A Tui-hisli o ’al rcccntlr
said that their schools could “teach
lessons" just as well, nut that they
could not "teach Character" as the
American schools.

The Shaiitiing Clir _ in Uiiii-ersitr.

China is my cagcr today to add
all that is host in the learning and
life of the West to all that is nest in
her past. No institution in China has
had a greater part in creating this do»
sirc than the Shamllug Christian Uni»
rersity. located in North China in the
great Province of Shaiitung.

The members of the American Pie
hvtorian ission and or [he English
Baptist Mission, hotli Missions having
a strong wo t in snantung, agreed to
unite in organizing three colleges, an
Arts College at ii'cihsoln, a Theologi»
cal college at Tsingchowlu, and a
Medical College at Tsliiaulii..

other evangelistic .ll sions in Shan-
tung oi- ddjacellt proiinces were in-
iiicd to enter this Ullioll. At re-
cent annual meeting at the niicrsity
Council it was resolved "That we in.
vite hcth committees of ariimoll
alumni, ilie one iu amine“ and the
other in China, to consider the p’ossi»
hility or providing a professor in one
or more ot the colleges oi the Shah-
tiiiig Christian University, and it pos»
sihlc also to provide a residence for
each." The united colleges are called
~ ‘lle Shantung Christian University."

The ﬁeld of this Ullil't‘l-slly consists

hoi-t' us of thc adiacont Pl'ovlllces ol
Chili, iionan, Kiting Lu, and An llivei.
a territory with a population at he»

imagine only two colleges or Unircr-
sities iii the United States—one east
and one wesl. or the Mississippi, and
the land not even touched with the
