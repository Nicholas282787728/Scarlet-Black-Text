"The iloral Bases of Personal
Power was the suhiect of President
Fitch's address at Y. it. u A, Thursday
evening, The stirring talk that he
gzre was heard by the largest crowd
of the year. which nearly ﬁlled the
Association rooms.

The ﬁrst thought iii-ought tor-ward hy
the speaker was that in every man
there lirc anihitioirs, aspirations, and
desires, and that in every true man
there is the nnrhltion to become a
leader; not only to hare power over
people hut to enjoy their personal con—
dcnca and respect, For the attainment
at this aiuhition. Respect. ot self is
the greatest asset a map can possess
and tlri. is usually desti-a ed hy the
great sins which have always ucsot
manhood, Tire great pity ahorrt it is
that these sins use up the power in a
niau that normally would aid him in
the cttorl, to attain his ainhitions.

it a irran has that desire in him
which compels him to take risks, iuv
stead of gamhling away his time, he
should take those risks which. if sum
cesslul, will hcrrcht the race. Such
~ ks were taken hy Darwin, Colour
hus. E t. on. and they gar-e soincting or
real ralrie to Ihe world.

in regard to drinking, the speaker
declared that there was ahsolulely no
excuse tor a youth trying to stimulate
hin elf with drink. when he does so,
it is a confession that he lacks within
him that stimulating irillucirce oi
youth nhiclr every young man should
possess.

in conclu president Fitch
brought out the fact that sell-respect

Truly great men car iirto mature life
