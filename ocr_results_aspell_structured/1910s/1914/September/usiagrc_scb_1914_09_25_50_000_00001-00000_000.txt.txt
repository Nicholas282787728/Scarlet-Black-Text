“ALIEN T0 GITIZE’N”
DH. STEINEH’S BOOK

AUTOBIOGRAPHY 0F GRIN-
NELL FACULTY MEMBER
PUBLISHED.

Dr, Steiner Makes Great Appeal
Through Telling of Life»
Story~Work Strongly
Sympathetic.

Doctor Steine s autobiography,
“From Allen to Citizen," has just lelt
the prcss ot the Fleming H. Revell
Company, This is of Prof, Steiner‘-
life story and is of especial interest
to Grinnell people who are so well ac-
, quaiuted with the author.

The sld is told in a most must
llul and gr plug style and the reade s
interest is held lroln lilo I'llst. it is
characteristic of Dr. Sleiller‘s ade
dresses and talk as Cl‘lllllell knows
them, and» the reading proves more in-
terosllng than al . conceivable novcl.

Pl-otcssor Steiner has wrillen many’
books on the immigrant question, but
he could not work out a better way
of accomplishing his purpose than
he has in his lire story. In this we see
every condition wlliclr the immigrant
is forced to endure train the time he
leaves his native land until he becomes
an Alllelican citizen.

in his introduction Prat. Steiner
says, "On the whole, that which hap-
pcned to me has happened—is happen-
invite others"; and we loel drawn by
this strong plea that the new inimi-
grant may get that fair chance, “that
contact “Mr the vilal forces 01 our
INew \Vorld civl izalion which has
prcred so ellicacious in my own
case."

“There are countless ones who live
and die without know-lag that America
is not a stepmother who grudges us
our wages and cares only for our
brute strength.”

The cause for which Prof. Steiner is
ﬁghting is a strong one and he has
entered into it with his whole heart.
The writing of his lite star has meant
that he lay hare his whole life.

“This making a record of one's life
' not an easy or pleasant task, i
have alu” s shrunk trom it, especially
as it ronui ed the laying bare at my
soul, and the analys s oi those throes
which touched my religious llfe."

Prof. Steiner shows no aggressive
feeling in his work, but rather a deep
sympathy. ”This book was not written
to incl-case prejudice llut rattler to
allay and it 1 answer the dues ion.
‘llow we do it,‘ or more especial if
llris record teaches some one ’How not
to do it,’ l shall rejoice to have written
this hook, even lholrglr the wr
volved great struggle and slrc -,

The work itself is a matserpiecc and
must he read to be appreciated. 1t

any lihl-al
Dr Steiner dedicates this new hook
to his children.

lNORRIS TALKS ON HARVARO

Returned Exchange Professor Says
Harvard Excels Grinnell
In Democracy.

COMPARES STUDENT TYPES

Prof. H w. Norris, l lely returned
from six months spent ill the East as
lln ard Exrlla-lge Pruiessor, talkcd
rcr, interestingly and nmusingly in
chapel Fl' ~ g on the subject
of The Harvard Student.

allnl‘il of hono , If a man deserves
rocogunion at a hands of his college
mates he can‘ count on receiving it.
That cl-inlrell is less democratic than
llarvard is due partly to coreducatlou
in Grinnell.

As a place for graduate study, Har-
vard, with Boston an additional ate
traction, otters splendid opportunities
But undergraduate lite is hardly so
praiseu'ol'tm the Grlnnell under-
graduate is better cared for than the
Harvard yearling.

There are three noteworthy classes
among Hal-lard men: The rich snobs,
the uufortunatcs who go through the
courses with no college interests, and
the leaven of llre whole,—lhe sane ma
jority “who are in constant rebellion
to things as they are."

Professor Nor is found himself tre-
quently comparing the Grinnell with
lhe ltarrard man. otton to the latter's
detriment. The llarvard men are less
tastehlllr dressed. though often more
extravagantly; they disﬁgure theme
selves with huge sheila nmed study-
glasses; l tart, according to the
lspeaker, A Harvard student can
