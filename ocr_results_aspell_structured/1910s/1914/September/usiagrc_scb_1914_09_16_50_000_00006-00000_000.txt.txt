Women’s Dormitories, which are to
cost over $150,000 and will accommo-
date 150 wonren ot the College. have
been completed, and already the feline
dations are being laid. lt will not be
long alter the returned students have
settled ior the opening college year
when the new “Shack” will begin to
take actual shape and term.

The contract lor the new dormitories
was let on July 20 to the Bailey arsb
Company, of Minneapolis. Tile cone
sideration on the general plans was
tlseboo. R. V. 'Phclps, the construe
tion superintendent now in charge,
arrived the ﬁrst part of August, aird
since that time the work or Ll‘ﬁnsfol‘v
mation has proceeded rapidly. Tire
building will be ﬁnished by August 15,
1915.

As can be seen troni the excavations.
the plans tor the dormitories provrde
tor three buildings. a large central
building and two adjacent dormitories
or cottages.

The largest and most southern ey-
caration is the location or this central
building. which will be the center at

on the east side at the building. The
dining hall will be lnll two stories
and is to be ﬁnished in Gothic style.
A large coi or connecting the main

There are to he no rooming iaerlities
on the ﬁrst door oi the central builds

will pro de tor about ﬁtty girls.

A long, covered corridor, running
north and smith on the west side at
the two adjoining cottages will con-
nect them with the main building. They
will also bc connected thru the base-
ment. so that the plans tor the three
really constitute one big building.

These two smaller cottages join the

 

central building on the north. and will
