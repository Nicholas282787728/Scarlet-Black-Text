Will Be Held For

Three hundred and fifty Grinttell
students are planning to go to Des
Moines today to witness the Drake
Grinnell game. A large majority of
the crowd will go on the special tram,
but a considerable number went to

. Des Moines last night, and a great
many more have taken the early train
this morning

The special leaves Gl-innell at s: 5
this morning and will reach Des Moiltes
about ten o'clock.

The Freshman team is to be taken to
Drake, in accordance with the custom
at former years. About twenLyrﬁve
Freshman players will make the trip.

The band, also taking the pilgrim
age, will be on the special this mornv
lng, ready to deliver the “goods".
With the varsity men, this totals about
sixty-ave persons who are being taken
to Drake with their expenses paid.

The game will be called at the Star
dium at 2:30 P. M. It is planned to
have all the Grinnell routers in one
section or the Stadium, and the men
and women will be separated as the
yell leaders believe this \vlll be the
must efficient method of organizing
the routers.

“stop Thief" is billed to appear at
the Princess in the evenlng, and as it
is the occasion of the Annual Football
Night at the theatre, a great numbe‘r
oi the Grinnell routers will attend the
entertainment.

The special will leave Des Moines
about 11 o'clock F. M., in order to ale
low plenty of time for those Who do
attend the show to make the train.

The University of Missouri has
adapted it novel scheme for the pur-
pose of enlorcing students to attend
classes. Under the new regulation a
student forfeits one credit for each
total of seventeen absences during a
semester. It is expected that this rul-
lng will greatly stimulate attendance
in all Courses.

Crowd Kits Snake-Dance Before
Meeting at Gym—Speakers
Make Spirited Plea for
Drake Trip.

“Some mass meeting!" From the
time the crowd left the Men's Gym and
started down town, led by the Band,
until the lost “Grinnell we yell” was
given after the speeches. the ofiicial
pep thermometer kept rising until it
registered close to the boiling point,
and another "Duck Drake” mass
meeting passed into history last night
At least three hundred loyal Grinner
linns will be on the train this morning
as a result.

After supper the crowd congregated
at the Men's Gym and from there
marched through the streets, the Band
at the head of the procession, down-
town, where more yells were given with
a vim that forebode evil for the blues
sweatered Bulldogs. Then the parade
made its way back to the Gym Where
the "pep»fest” began in real earnest.

Captain Witters told what the team
would do if only given the combined
support of the student body. Pat‘s
talk was short and to the point and
expressed the sentiment of the whole
team.

Staut Turner, an old Crinnellian
who has carried the Scarlet and Black
to victory many times In years gone
by, gave a talk that was as impressive
as forceful, and urged every true Grin-
nell man and woman to journey to Des
hioihes with the team today.

Then netha Wagner, “the human
hair generator,” followed with a
speech in a manner that left no doubt
that there was at least one member
of the fair sex that intended to go to
Des Moines and risk seeing the team
“Duck Drake."

The yelling was much better than
before the Leander Clark game, and
made the walls or the old Gym ring
with the real note or confidence and
loyalty of the College.

The taculty generously allowed a
few minutes after chapel Thursday
morning ior another demonstration
and revival for today's battle. The
band greeted the crowd as they came
from the building and added much to

 

the success of the short session.

A mass—meeting of all the girls oi the
College Thursday night went far to
ward deciding the doubtful ones on
the Drake question before the demon
stration last night.

The band met with the representa-
tives of the tair sex at the Y. w. and
heading the procession, marched
through the downtown streets to the
“Met" where a iced was indulged in,

Speeches served to keep the revival
or spirit at its height and each girl
made a strong appeal for the journey
to Des Moines today. The arguments
of most of the undecided ones were
battered down and finally nearly every
girl present was pledged to take the
special this morning. Grihnell will
have the largest crowd of girls in the
ranks of the fans today that has ever
gone to help “Duck Drake” as a re-
sult.

GAMES WITH DRAKE
NUMlﬂEIGHTEEN

BULLDOGS AND GRINNELL
HAVE NEARLY EQUAL
NUMBER VICTORIES.

WﬂRSTYEAR FDR GRINNELLIEN’DA-

Scarlet and Black Wins Three
Successive Games After a.
Disastrous Defeat by
67 toDScore.

Eighteen Drake-Gt-lnuell football
games are on record in the many years
of athletic relationship between the
Scarlet and Black and the Des Moines
institution.

In the whole history, Grinnell has
been decidedly able to take her share
of the victories, althu Drake has often
overwhelmed the Scarlet and Black in
post conﬂicts, much more than the
Grinnell squad was able to do with the
Bulldogs. Grinnell has won seven out
of the games played, the victories run-
ning all along back into 1897.

The year 1904 was the most disase
lruus to Gl‘inllell when Drake piled up
a score of (57 points, and the Scarlet
and Black failed to tally. The followV
ing year, however, Grinnell regained
the lost ground, and also won the two
following years.

In 1912 came the memorable defeat
of the Bulldogs by a 13 to 0 score,
when Grinnell took advantage of the
Blue and White over-conﬁdence and
made a touch-down and two goals
from the ﬁeld, holding her opponents
scoreless.

The annual contests at the Stadium
have been unusually lial’drlought and
close in the last few years, and today's
game promises to bear out the state-
ment.

FDR DRAKE SLASH

DEFEAT 0F SATURDAY
LEAVES HUSKIES IN
GOOD SHAPE.

SAYS DRAKE HAS ADVANTAGE

Drake Delphlo Expects Hard Game
But Favors Blue and White.
Norris Will Replace
'Doc’ Little.

Gl'lnuell is ready for Drake. These
two rivals of ntteen rears linerup in
the stadium today with every man

keen for the tray and with both elevsus
in the best at condition.

The Drake Delphic says the Bulldogs
expect a hard battle but have appar:
ently “the edge on Grinnel The
story continues to say, however, that
the Scarlet and Black always play
their best against the Blue and White
and that even a weak team is to be
feared from past experience.

The wearers of the "G" are in the
best of condition and are going into
the conflict this afternoon with a (1&4
termination which has formerly made
victories, with the brand of sup-
port and rooting for which the annual
visitors to the stadium are noted.

The Drake student body undoubtedly
expects a victory this afternoun, es-
pecially alter the successes of the
Leander Clark and Central College
games, but comparative scores never
did make acceptable done in the mix
with Grinnell. The teams are evenly
enough matched to make possible a
surprise for Drake similar to the one
Grinnell handed out two years ago.

Since the surprising defeat at this
hands of Leander Cldl'k last Saturday,
Coach Fisher has been Working his
squad hard in order to remedy the de-
iccts which were Visible in the Scarlet
and Black eleven in the initial game.

Much of the time has been spent in
coaching the interference, in an at—
tempt to prevent a repetition of the
performance or last week, Fool‘ inter-
ference was one of the main reasons
for Grinnell's failure to gain against
Leander Clark, and if it can be reme-
died, the Scarlet and Black should
be able to gain ground consistently
against Drake today.

The team is considerably handicap-
ped by the loss or Little, who will be
unable to play the remainder of the
season on account of injuries.

“Bugs" Norris has been getting out
daily, however, and has been used to
advantage in the back-ﬁeld. Norris is
the fastest man on the squad and will.
undoubtedly start at “No, t1" today.

The- line has been considerably
strengthened, with the efficient coache
in; oil Joe Greenwood, and will un-
doubtedly put up .1. better game than
last Saturday. ScllWah has been-
"coming into his own" and played an
especially good game in the scrim-
mage Thursday.

Whitmer has been showing up well,
and seems to be booked for at trial
against Drake today.

Crass, Macy and Severeitle will also
get ﬂ. chance in the game it there
is any possibility of using them to ad-
vantage. Cross may be used at end.
and Sevel'eide will probably get a. good
trial at the pilot position.

Fisher has sititl very little about the
game today. He has given the men
all that he could, and expects every
member of the team to play the best

 

game possible.
