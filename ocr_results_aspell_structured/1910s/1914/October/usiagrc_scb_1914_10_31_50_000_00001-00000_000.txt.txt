the Evening,

The Freshmen assembled in the
men’s gymnasium last night ior their
ﬁrst social event oi llie year which
took the lorm or a "hard times"
party.

The idea oi "hard times“ was car-
ried out to pericction by the varied
costumes and disguises which appear-
ed on the door. litany oi the Fresh-
men were dressed as “Old Maids" and
“hobo’es,” and these classes of people
attempted to and certainly succeeded
in expressing the popular idea or
“hard Limes."

Flashy shades or red and yellow
were very popular among the cos»
turnes and the varied colors gave all
appearance oi iesii , to llle motley
crowd,

Some oi the men in particular were
pel-iectly disguised alld could not be
recognized hour the balcony, The nee
grocs wcre especially well “madeaur-
and their appearance contrasted sharp
iv with that or the remainder oi the
crowd.

ill-luv iorms oi amusement were oi-
iered lor the entertainment or the
revelers. Swings and teeterrtutters
were much in demandL hcillg kept ill

-collslnnt use.

Those who were ullable to ﬁnd any
or lllese vacant started oldrfashioned
games, such as (lromllleJlallilkerchief.
and ing-dutchman. Tlle Virginia

oi amusement.

The hilarity oi the crowd drowned
out the eiiorts ol a iour iccc orches-

north side oi the main door.

Ibeireshments were served later in
the evening to those who stood in line
