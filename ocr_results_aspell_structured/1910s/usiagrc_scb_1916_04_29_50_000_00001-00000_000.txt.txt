5010 Work Will Be of Unusual In}
terest This Year—Part II To
Have “Stunt” For Usual
Popular Appeal.

c For the first time in Grilluell's ilisl«

my the home cullt‘el‘l‘. hy the Men‘s
Glee Club is to be looked [or-ward to
as part of the annual May Festival
program. The appearance will be.
made a week from tonight, when the
opening concert will be given rri Her»
rick Chapel.

The new arrangement resulted lroln
the desire of the Festival management
to incorporate into their program as
many attractions of general interest
as'possible. It was also the desire oi
the club to rid itseli of the respon.
bility of managing a home concert.
Lack of a May pageant or athletic
event on Saturday preceding the or»
chestral concerts will be largely made
up by this added attraction.

A pr'ogiam, unusually interesting
because Bf three solos in addition to
the club conuibutions, has_ been deflr
nitely announced. Heiheit Grey, (one
or, and Philip Kelleher, baritone, hill
both appear, While Ml‘. Peck, \‘iolin
instructor, will give an instrumental
selection FAY! ll, designated in the
program as containing “something
different,” \lill probably have the “5*
Hal popular appeal in the form of 3.
novel Stunt. The uolk of the club,
Particularly because of (hell [we con-
cert {Bill's at vacation time, is anticl-
