EDNFERENBE RAGE
BEGIMATUBDAY

Coe Game Is First of Series to
Decide the Championship
of Conference

With the Iowa game tucked away
in the victory bag. the Grinnell wal-
riors are turning their attention to
the game with Coe here next Satur-
day. lThis game will he one or thc
ﬁrst of a critical series in the Iowa

conference.

By defeating Iowa, Grinnell has a
good look-in at the state title, but
must wait until the end of the sea-
Son to make that claim good, How-
ever. the Iowa. conlel‘ence title is
still at large, and Coe. Cornell and
Gl'innell are on hot on the trail.
The game Saturday will eliminate
one of the contenders, so it is eel»
tain that both teams will make a
‘deterinined scrap for the Vietcn’.

Good Scrap Expected

The least that can be said is that
_Grinnell is Optimistic. The Iowa
game has instilled a. goodly amount
of conﬁdence in the local camp, and

, it is believed that the team can go
the rest of the schedule without los-
ing a. game, At the Same time [here
is a feeling that no game can he Won
in the future without it good scrap
and both players and tans are look-
ing to the hardest games to come

For the most part, the men came
out. of the tray zit lows in good cone
dition. Minor bruises Were numerous
and Grant is laid up with a. chipped
hone in his shoulder. It is not cerr
tztin whether he will be used again
soon or not. It is possible that saw
