is all the ‘dlcrry Widow‘ was and more. i
it represents the latest 11) dancing, the}
best in music and the most original ini
comedy or any musical comedy of the,
type that has appeared here in several
seasons. Rather, perhaps, it should be
said, the piece is a type in itself,

“Dorothy South, who sang the lead-
ing i-olc last eveningi is admirably cast
tor the part oi the 'Pl'lllcess,’ A voice
as soft as velvet with a wide range,
grace and agility as a dancer and a
pleasing couuctry are qualities she
possesses iii abundant measure. She
has an able second in Ethel Boyd, who,
as Grace Ilolbroolt, is apt to be talrcii
tor the star at her lirst appearance.

“The play ' set in three acts with a
wealth or scenic cilccts. The chorus is
exti‘itol‘dlllaly in its diversity or cos»
tuining. In tact, it doesn’t look at all
like the ordinary run oi choruses, And
greater volume oi sound is made by
twenty—lire voices than has been heard
here in several years.

“Among the song hit. arc: ‘le Like
To Be a Qllittel‘,‘ ‘I Wish 1 was an 1s-
land in an Ocean 01‘ Girls.‘ ‘1 Nccd Al-
lection,‘ by the Princess ‘Pat,’ The
Shoes or Husband Number One as
Worn By Number Two,’ and ‘TWO
Laughing Irish Eyes. ' '-

Mcacliain also picked or: four ring—
ors. Bagge did some pretty dribbling,
and eluded Drake's captain for two
good goals. Swan's foul throwing was
“A No. 1," and his guarding was above
reproach. He and Soiners held the
Drake forwards scoreless.

Erwin Sfilrs For Drake.

Smith, Ervin and \Vzirnoclr played
the be t game (or the Bulldogs. The
latter's height enabled‘ him to make
some wonder-[ill stops at higii passes.
Smith made three haslrets,»onc uf them
coming after a long dribble. Ervrn's
ioiir ringers in the iirst half were all
pretty shots.
