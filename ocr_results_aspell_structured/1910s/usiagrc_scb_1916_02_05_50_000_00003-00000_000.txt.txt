GRETCHEN STEINER AT Y.W,T).A.

Member of Class of 1915 Tells of
Social Settlement Work,

“Social Service Viewed From the
Settlenieiit'v was the topic treated by
Gretchen steiner at y. W. Thursday
hight,'this being the second ot the se~
ries oi the association's vocational
talks.

“Settlement work," said hliss stein-
er, "means neighhorliness spelled ii ith
capital letters."‘ Personal experiences
in connection with Christodora House
in New York, where the spealicr spent
the past lew months, and a review or
the worli oi the House were given in
an interesting manner by Miss Steiner,
emphasis being placed upon the nnin,
her oi phascs oi the \mrlgipilysical,
spiritual, and educational.

From the standpoint of money-male
ing, settlement nork was not recom-
mended except to those deiinitely
equipped lor some one line or work;
but irom the standpoint oi the joy or
giving, the speaker pointed out, a his
iield and gratifying results await the
person who has a real love ioi- peos
pie.
