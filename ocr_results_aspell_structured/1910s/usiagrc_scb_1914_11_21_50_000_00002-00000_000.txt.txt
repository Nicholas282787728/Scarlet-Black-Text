"GIVING” IS Y. W. SUBJECT

Eva Hall Leads Helpful Meeting
Thursday Evening,

"Giving" was the nhjert illstli. ell
hi- Eva Hall at Y, ll, Thiirsdar night.
Four different. phases of giving wore
treated.

“When we give monei
with a. willing spirit, was the iii,t
point made by Miss Hall. “tor it not
onl_ helps along the cause ior uhicli
it is intended, lint also helps us to he
unselﬁsh."

In giving our time to various activi-
ties, we must use our own judgment
and divide our time honestly. Giving
joy is everyone's duty. the leader cin-
plinsized, (or it lies within evel'yone‘s

‘ power.

In closing Miss Hall pointed out that
the most important part of giving is
selirgii‘ing. tor it includes all others.
We should give our best and truest
selves not alone to others. but to God
and His service. and in the very truest

lspirit, for “the gift without the giver

is here."
