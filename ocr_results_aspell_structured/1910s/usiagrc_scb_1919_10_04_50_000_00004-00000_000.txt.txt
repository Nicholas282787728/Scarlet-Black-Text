“All or us are in a measure fresh-
men this year," declared Prof, n, D.
oritriur at the v. M. meeting Thursday
night. ”The new men from [lie high
schools and the old men back from the
army are all asking if they can make
good.

“College is a place to train people
to make fewer mistakes in lite, The
various courses are valuable in that
they show us the mistakes of Others.
Foﬂege is neither all study. nor all
society, nox- all religion, but is a real
community in which all inllucnees are
mingled.

”’Ille emotional side or lire ls ant to
be neglected and the intellectual (were
emphasized. The r is the only organ»
izzttiuu in school working among the
men for the furthering of the highest
ideals of life and therefore evcl'y Grin—
hell man should be behind it and
boost."

If you fail to get your S. it B.
