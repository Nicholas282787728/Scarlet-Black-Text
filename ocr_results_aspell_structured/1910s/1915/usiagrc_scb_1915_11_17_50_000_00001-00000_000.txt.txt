game at the season with the prohalile
result that it will he a battle royal
hetueep two elenly matched elevens.

Gr-iitiiell hoped to in .

Grinnell is conceded the odds in the
coming game and is generally doped
as the probable winner. Although Calm
nell has the etlge iii a comparison at
the Carleton and Leander Clark games
with each oi the teams which meet
Saturday. the Vernonites could only
tie the Highland Par-tr team which de-
ieated Drake 16 to 13. Grinnell holris
the advantage here by having given.
Drake a 53 to 0 trouncing. Out of this
tangle or scores, Coe emerges a victor
over Finger's men by 1-1 to 10, while
the ncAlmonites deieated the Crimson
17 to 5. giving them an apparent ad-
vantage over the purple Warriors. .1

in the game last Saturday Cornell
had Coe heaten 11) to 0 until the last
quarter, when they weakened and al~
lowed their opponents two touchdowns.
This battle was an important one for
the lit. Vernon team, and they are
hard pressed to get into smooth run—
ning order ioi- Saturday's game.

hiaiiy who saw the Coe-Cornell game
Saturday are predicting that Cornell
will give the locals the hardest light
it will he the lirst time
this year that the local line has been
perceptinly outweighed, and us the
heavy Cornell toi-wards have been al~
most inrincihle in their previous games

rit is thought that the two lines will

tight on comparatively cieii terms.
Coach Finger oi Cuiiiell has seen the
Scar LLEllill iii ritt on three times. and
it is lircly tliiii he has made no minor
