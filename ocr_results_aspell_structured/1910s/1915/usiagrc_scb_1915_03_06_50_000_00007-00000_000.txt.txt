College Democracy
15 Big Factor.

A college, two-thirds ot iillose men
are more or less sch-supporting and
in which over halt the men earn trom
$100 to me a year—such an institu-
tion is Grinnell as shown irom a set
or statistics compiled irom reports oi
last year iu regard to college expenses.

The tact that such a large majority
of Gl'illnell work their way
through college is indicative ot the
met that apportumties tor work are
numerous. Added to this iaet is the
significance oi the'two employment bu-
reaus, the one maintained hy the ad-
ministration and the other by the
Y, , . Q. A. These two agencies to-
gether elticiently provided work tor-
all who desired it during the term.

The actual expense in hard ﬁgures
is also at interest. According to six
tistics oi the bu , IS the average
expense, ior men, working and not
uorlring, is appro. nretely 3450. Di
this amount $300 is ﬁxed and invarL
able, except when equivalent work is
done, consisting of:

Board and Room ............... $190
Tuition 100
Semester Fee .. . . to

$300

To this amount must he added incl—
dentals which var from 320 to $200,
depending upon individual tastes.

L ulouce oi the absolute democracy
at (' iunell is to he had in the root
that the College honors the than who
