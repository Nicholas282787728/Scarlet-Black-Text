ers who appear on the field again next

But the that that so large a riurtibcr of

there will be no serious loss of iiiﬂ‘

Nelson and Little will be the only
artists lost through graduation, and
as a result it ilnion will have a squad
of veterans \iilll which to build ilp his

every positron, especially for .c ends

Freshman squad, is iegﬂi‘iled lay tiiaiiv
as the most promisrg quarterback
that has appeared on the Grinnell field
in years and it is confidently eypcciod
that he will he a prominent contender
in 1916. To the file or six men who
have been used at the ends this 1 ar
will be added sevcral likely Freshmen
and it is not unreasonable to predict
that the coach will have little trouble
in turning out two fast pairs of wing
men.

Backficid Should Be Wonder.

Grinncil loses no men in the back-
fieid and if this were not enough to
promise a fast and heavy set of backs
next fall, there will be added real stars
from the yearlings. Grant and Da" are
fast men, Kasper and, Fitch have Elem
working in the Flash backfield and
will make likely candidates in back
or wing positions.

In all probability h Clarch will fill
captain Nelson’s po Lion iii the centcr
of the line. "Red" w held in reserve
for this position during UI‘ season ptst

big captain has not had tirric cited for

nccted that the Scarlet men will hi-c-
sent one of the strongest forward wall»:
in the statr.

McAlmolI will begin the loll; season
with an entirely different proposition
on his hands from tliat wli -h he faced
last September, as he will know his
men and what ire can eypect from each
individual. Ari abundance of material
will leave no uncertain _ n develop-
ing an efficient and wcllai'uulided m
chine. The Scarlet cohorts will begin
the season as a marked aggregation
which has a reputation to maintain in-
stead of with one to make, and Gun-
nell routers are looking forwa to
1916 for another season's succe '
football.

Walt, at quarter, is a mail whose
work this season has been on the phe-
noriieiial order. Altlluiigh an inexpe-
rienced candidate at the start of tho
seasoir, he iras made good with a veh-
geance and proved that he could run
the learn successfully besides being one
of the most consistent members of the
backfield in advancing the ball. His
work iii returning punts has attracted
favorable comment wherever he has
appeared. Meek, as under-study to the
regular quarlreback, has been a hard
ﬁghtel- throughout theseason and with
a severe test of his mettle in the Drake
game he won a reputation for himself
by his efficient work.

His work in defense has been a stellar
feature of tile elel'en's play arid oppos-

states 'iile notice because of his ability
to advance the ball, Augustine has cut-

has counted five times by field goals.
