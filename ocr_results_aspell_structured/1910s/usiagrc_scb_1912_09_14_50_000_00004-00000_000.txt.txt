DR. STEINER LEADS CHAPEL
Gives Splendid Address at the Fri-
day Morning Service,

Iloeloi Steiner (leli‘ ed a Splcllilill
addr rss in Chapel Friday morning. His
talk dealt with the quaIlilCS and char-
acteristics which inalie nations as well
the the citizens of nations. His ﬁrst
point was loyalty to duty, the loyalty
which makes one go forth to his dut
cheerfully, considering it, whatever it
be, :1 special favor from the Almighty.
Secondly, he must be "persistently par
tian and patiently persistent," letting
nothing hinder him irorn the comple-
tion or his task. Doctor Steiner's third
point was that one must learn to do his
war hith efficiency. Haste does no
good when it is haste “Ilich accom-
plishes nothing. And lastly one must
submiL to his superiors and to the
power above all with an Intellectual
submission Mrich does not question in
its obedience. Mr. Steiner concluded
by saying that all these points are as
{our ﬁngers unit-h are held together
by a thumb, u hi I! is faithful reverence
for and trust in God, combined with
prayer.
