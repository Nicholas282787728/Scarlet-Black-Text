saloon," he said. "I am opposed to the
whislry business in any iorm. Now, if
anyone here tonight knows any strong-
er terms which 1 might make, I wish
he would tell me when i leave this
hall so that I might use them next
time. And I have no compromise at
any kind to make with the business."

Mr. Havner's idea of the Governor's
part in enforcement o; the liquor laws
was instructive. “If I am elected At-
torney General and it the Governor
should come across the hall to my of—
fice and tell me to discontinue any
prosecution against the bootlegger
that may have been started. or should
advise me not to institute any proceed—
ings 1 might plan on, I would tell him
to go back across the hall and look
arter his own business, and 1 would
see that the laws were properly one
forced. The Governor, even it “wring-
ing.wet," could not interiere with any
prosecutions the Attorney General
might think necessary, Mr: Banner on
gued, and tor pl'oof he quoted from the
state constitution on this point

Following ltlr. Hay-tier, Lieutenant
Governor Harding discussed at length
the liquor and road issues. He was
frequently interrupted by the applause
or his audience who. as it soon became
‘evident, tast came to sympathize with
him.
