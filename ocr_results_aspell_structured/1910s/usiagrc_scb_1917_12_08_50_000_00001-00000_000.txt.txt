dAﬂﬂBSEN MASTER ARTIST

rihyiug Characterized by Rhythm and
Accuracy or Tuuc

Presents Scxtette From “Lucia” Ull-
itccolrrpltnicd as Encore

In his violin recital at Herrick
chapel on Friday evening Sascha
Jacobseu showed himself a lilastcr
at his chosen instrument. I-lls play-
ing was characte d by a well do-
Veloped sense of rhythm and accu—
racy of tone. This was especially
true of the three rlance movements.

Several elieores were demanded

during the program. For one of
these Mr. Jacobsen played the sex-
tctte from "Lucia" unaccompanied,
in which two pal-ts were distingui h-
zthle. .
Kreisler's violin arrangement of
Bach: "Freludio,” played by Jacob-
son, Contrasts with the simple ar—
rangement interpreted by the Trio
do Lutece last month.

Miss Alina Putnam deserves special
attention for the sympathetic manner
in which she played D‘Il‘. Jacobsen’s
accompaniments. The broltcn time
in the "Preludio" was a real test for
an accompanist.

No Cons at All’
Is Varsity Song

Football Men Go Thru Season
Without a Single ”Con”
in Studies

Grrnnell athletes are Gr'innellschnl-
ars. Anyone who doubts that state~
lnellt can look at the record of the
toolball team for the past season.
out of the twenty or more men who
wcrc eligible for varsity games, not
one of them was kept out, of any
game because of a "con.” Pretty
good, hubl

The season was a memorable one
as far as games won goes, but just
as much emphasis should be placed
on their other record; no “cons" dur—
ing the 1917 season. The one led to
the other. It would have been im-
possible to have had so successful a
st-ason had a, good share of the men
been down in their studies. On the
other hand, it is not too much to be-
llcve that the exercise of the gridiron
was beneﬁcial to the studies.

It is claimed that the members or
tile varsity have rewritten the words
01 a popular song, and that they are
now singing:

“No cons at all! No cons at all!

We Went tlmi the season with no

cons at all!”

GIRLS ADOPT WAR MENU

A group of s'vteen girls at the Uni»
versity of Missouri has adopted a
“war menu" to aid in food conserva—
tion. Cereal sweetened with syrup
instead of sugar, whectless and meat-
lcss days are (Ill included under the
new regime. Flues of ten cents will
he Collected from slackers who leave
bread, butter, or sugar in their coffee
cups.

year’s varsity, will referee the series.

TIILLEFSIJN WILL HETlIIIN

Coach Is Under Three-Year Gen.
tract With Grinnell

Coach Tollefson will return no
Gr'ihhell as tootball coach next fall.

A three-year contract has been
drawn up, which will hold unless the
\var interferes. Spring practice will
also take place the same as usual.

At present Tollefson is the assist-
ant county auditor of Hennepin coun~
ty, with his unice in Minneapolis.

HIT] GHAMPIITNSHIP IN 1893

The last time that the state title
was settled without a doubt in layer-
of Griunell was in 1893.

That year the scarlet and black
played both Ames and Iowa, deteat~
mg the former as to s and the latter
as to 14. Since then Crinnell has
never played them both in the same
season, and comparative scores have
never been decisive enough to settle

Ireshmen, 'l

 

the matter.
