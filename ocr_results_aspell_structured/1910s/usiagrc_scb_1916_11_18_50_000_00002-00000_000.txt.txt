it is interesting to look pact. over
the editorial columns oi The Scarlet

meat on the treatment Colllcll gave
us at the Mount Vernon toothall game
last Noreuihcr. tinder the title, “our
Hand, Cornell," the attitude of our
neighhoiiug institution is praised in
the highest terms, all or which only
emphasizes the necessity- tor prorid-
ing them a liberal herth on our ironie—
coining program next week. The ed-
ito ial iollows
"ii erer a ting iootbnll team and
a visiting hody ot rooters were royally
received and royally entertained, it
was last Saturday when Grlnuell play-
ed Cornell at Mt, Vernon, Cornell has
a reputation for good sportsmanship
and clean athletics wherever she has
athletic relations, and she certainly
maintained her reputation when the
Grinnell team and its supporters, the
oldest ils she knows, were her
guests this year. Any crowd can
cheer the opposing team when it is
a losing one, hut the institutions are
scarce in Iowa which have a spirit
‘ and student body that cheers their op-
poncnts as victors, as did‘ Cornell ai—
ter the Glillllell victory Saturday.
Both sounds were bouqueted alter the
game, one oi the ieatures ot the sea-
son tor the visitors, and at no time
during the day could a Grinnellian he
in want and not have a Cornellian
ready to shou- his hospitality .ilay we
soon he able to repay such royal treou
inept. llci our hand. Cornell!"

it has been suggested that Grinnell
students show a vital interest in ncxl.‘
week‘s Homecoming by writing their
alumni friends and extending to thcm
a warm imitation to attend the three

iraiiare during a rainstorm, and a
naval light including the ’llklng ot a
monster passenger liner h, a siihinaiu
inc, are the features ol the great tiliu
spectacle “Ciri lion," which
presented at the Colonial yesterday and
which will he repeated tonight.

“Civilization" is one ot the host mov
ing picture dramas that has ever t-
cd Grinnell. It is a master-nil pl'odllt‘x
tion portraying a uiasterlul ideal in a
masteriul way. The idea or world
peace will always grip an American
audience, and especially one in Griir
iiell, where it has heen so irequently
discussed.

When shown at the Colonial last
night its war and peace scenes, Won-
doriullv realistic as they seemed,
hrought ireouent applause iroiu the
audience it is seldom that a local due
dicnce applauds the mories, so that

that the picture is unusually well like
ed. That is the way “Cirll atioii" was
liked last night!

‘lt it intended {or the intellectual
class or people, and incidentally tor
the colege person, leaving one to do
his own thinking. Last night it care
ricd with it the evel'rllallntillg, un-
chri ian scenes or war, then in an
allegorical way presented the “low.
not hate" deal of peace
