The Evolution or College Baseball is
the subject or a rcr interesting and
suggestive article by H. s Pritchett,
President ot the Carnegie Fautidiilioll,
tor the Advancement oi Teaching,
wh lr appears in the April ‘issue at
Scribner-'s magazine hir. Pritclrett
writes tronr the standpoint or one who
was a college player or more than av-
erage ability and who had at the cams
pletion or his college training the op-
portunity to enter pr-oiessional ranks.

In a general preliminary slaLemem
relative to the early introduction or
baseball, the obviorrs merit oi the game
from the standpoint oi both player and
spectator and the gradrral change both
in the game itseli and its incidental
ieatrrres, Mr. Pritchctt leads up to
the hear-t oi his criticism or the mod-
etn college baseball games.

Some or the practices wlr -n he es~
pecially condemns is the practice oi
the players keeping up a continual
chorus oi cries as soon as the pitcher
takes the hall. while there in .' be
some excuse tor this practice in the
protessional game, wirerr introduced
into college games. it is vulgar beyond
expression The college games oi the
old day. when each man did his work
without screaming were indeﬁnitely
superior to the games oi today, and
they oiier-ed just as gootl opportrruity
for team play as can be attordeii by

\‘ths indiscriminate yelplrrg."

In general, however. the writer be-
lieves that most ot' the undesirable
practices in baseball as well as other
games have come flmn the presence oi
the protssicnal coach. He says:

“The college game has liLLle Lo 1052
in skill and everything to galrr in fair-
ness and decency by returning to the
plan oi leaving the direction oi the
same entirely to students and by
eliminating the proiessional coach.
The college should go out oi baseball
as a business and talte it up once more
as a game."

Tire increase in the expense oi main-
taining college teams is another ol‘ the
undesirable developments ilii'iilelil to
the pr -errt game, Tire increase in
ruonev paid tor elaborate anti irrrrr . s7
so » iprncrrt, the elaborate and his
urious traveling ai'l'iiilf'iimcitts provid-
ed tor long trips and the utter- tour
or the idea oi a training table all come
in tor a very generous share or the
criticism.

in respect to the expense involvetl
and the results achieved the writer-
makes a v at eitective contrast in the
methods iollowed at West Point and
Harv- As he had a boy playing
on each team last ycar he teols tarrly
familiar rvitlr conditions in each iiistir
tntiorr. At West Point baseball i 93‘
sentially a game Trips are iew and
short, there are no admission charges
to the games and the team plays with-
out the training at a coach, At Har-
VEII'Li nothing Liiai. money can secure is
spared to train the tearri ior the sear
son's games, yet iir spite oi this coir
trast in work, in an early some last
year, "the two nines played so nearly
the same game that diiicrencc between
the two was very small."

Another element present in the old-
tinre but generally absent now, was
the ”hospitality and simplicity" oi the
oid matches. Teams entertained each
other and mingled on a basis oi ”inter
collegiate comradeship and friendly
association.”

In conclusion Mr, Pitclrett makes
this very signiﬁcant statement: “I do
not believe the game will ever be what
it ought to be until our colleges irave
the courage to take action that will put
the game back into the hands on the
college boy."

to replace that altordctl in oitl east

That it was hard to secure accommo-
dations in the earlier da, - oi Grinnell
college was a well ltuow iact to the
older rseidcnts. students could not
ﬁnd accommodations or any sort in
some cases and sorrre oi 'the college
men used to take such quarters as the
loits ot wood sheds. Lumber at that
time had to be hauled ironr my to
one lruudrcd miles by wagon and
houses were hrrilt small. Moreover
the idea scorned to prevail that it was
not possible to keep students in one's
house and roomers and boarders with
any proﬁt. Al. one tinre betore the cy-
clone when rooms were not easily to
he had, two young men occupied a
room in the lott oi Pr-oiessor Parker’s
woodslred at his home in Chamberlin

tal eleruents oi ensemble rrrnsic are
concernedinimck shading, blend, are
ticulation, intonatioui the boys are
practically letter periect, excelling in
these points any club that I have ever
hear-d, here or elsewhere. The club's
program ranged as usual irom the pa»
thctic to the burlesque and train the
sublime to the ridiculous; no element
could have been spared, and ii there
was any sirpcrtirrity it was ii the seri-
oirs rather than anything else. The
best numbers on the musical part at
the program were the madrigai “When
the Bird Piiiering Goes," “My Old
Banjo," and two at the ehcores, the
"Piscah‘ix" and “You Were More Fair.
in the portrayal oi the delicate senti-
ment, in the latter the club’s work
is splendid and strikes the ditticult
mean between superﬁne precision ann-
spontaneity.

Dur Glee Litrhs have been as a rule
inclined to carry musical reﬁnement so
tar as to impair the iree and joytul
spontaneity which is the vital ele»
merit oi glee music, and especially a:
a college club made up oi the vigorous
type oi manhood which Griuneli is
proud to claim. in this respect last
night's concert marked a real improve
ment, especially after a couple oi inv.
ial encores had removed the inevitable
sell-consciousness oi the ﬁrst numbers
it seemed to be a pan, of the scheme C(1-
pass tr-om the artistic to the iarsical,
and the transition was accomplished
most eiiectively, The long wait he
tore the third part oi the program was
portentoirs in its indication oi some-
thing startling. When the wonder-int
musical aggregation presided over by
our old friend lierr- Knppelmeister Von.
nrummelstcin appeared astonishment
knew no bounds: and when they began
to play astonishment gave way to
iimllzemcni, which was about to culmi-
nate in ir-enzy when the tinrely Cui-
lapse ot Kappehneister- saved the day.
This stunt is a great improvement en
tire hoary slums oi iormcr concerts and
served not only to demonstrate many
ohscurc musical geniuses in our midst,
but also to reveal the pertect ladies
some or our men are. The final med-
lev lert nothing unsung. save “Rags"
