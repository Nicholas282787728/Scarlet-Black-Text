BURNELL MAY GANGEL
GAME WITH GHIIINELL

Scarlet FCYt‘l‘ Epidemic AI Mt. Vernon
Institution )[lty Cause Cancella-
tion of Game with (Ian'-

ue)‘s Men. .

Cornell may cancel the return base
ketball game with Grinncll scheduled
for the Mt. Vernon floor next Satur-
day night, according to an announce-
inent made in the last Cornellian.

The game with Upper lcwa on the
Cornell tloor dated [or iast night was
called off by the author ies because
or the severe scarlet Ievcr epidemic at
the neighhoring college. The purple
and gray fans are mourning that the
team will now have two weol wide
out a game “before the all-important
Gl‘lnnell game which is on the bill for
next Saturday." Further commenting
on this game. however. the Corueniau
says:

“There is a possihility. and a strong
possibility that it may he necessary to
call otf the Grinnell game also. Call-
ing this game off. however. would via
tally attcet the team's standing. Using
lplayed games as a basis or doping.
lthis game now looms up as the coir
terence championship hattle. It is
. true that Grinnell has deteated Cornell
[once but it Cornell can win the sec—
'Ond game, she will stand on even terms
iwith Grinncll, but at the head of the
percentage column, since Grinnoll does
not play as many center-once games as
‘does Cornell.”
