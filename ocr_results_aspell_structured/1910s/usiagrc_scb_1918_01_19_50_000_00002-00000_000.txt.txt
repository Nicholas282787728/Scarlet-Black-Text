FOR REAL PREPARATION

The adoption of military uniforms
would do more to increase the effici-
ency of drill than any other one thing.
Men in nrnrorrn would train more se L
ously. They would better realize the
purpose hehrnd the drill hour-s.

The question of expense is perhaps '

the most marked objection. it is a
real problem. Dr. Spragiie has made
the smtement that cheap uniforms
would be expensive in the long run.
They would not give sufficient service
to be worth while,
acceptable uniform could be bought
for is $20 or $25, and that sum to many
college men is almost prohibitive at,
this time. However, a good uniform
could he used by ulldel‘rclassmcn next
year and by other men who enter the
army.

'0nc step in the right direction, how—
ever, could be taken at once by team -
ing all cadet officers to appear in tini-
form, It would give the sergeants and
corporals the distinction which they
deserve at the armor or on the drill
field. It would be a big factor in keepr
ing up strict military discipline.

After all otiicei-s are uniformed, it
may be possible to Work out some ﬁr
naneial plan whereby the men of one
company at least may be helped to
buy uniforms. And by another year
it is to bc hoped that all Grinncll men
will be ill uniform, and taking regular
drill work two or three times a Week.

LIVE “Y” MEETINGS

Now that the Y it. C, A. building is
closed to conserve coal, it might be
1m siblc to try an experiment. that ote
fers an opportunity to change the zit-
titudc toward "Y” meetings brought
out in it communication from one of
the students in \Vctlllcsday’s Scailct

and Black.
The auditorium of Alumni hall is an

The least a really '

adin' 'ftble place for meetings of some
kind., but it is a little too formal for
the best type of Y. I. C. A, meetings.

If "Y” meetings were held at the
men's dormitories for a few weeks as
all experiment, it is entirely possible
that greater interest and enthusiasm
would be shown. The club-rooms
should be ﬁnished within one week,
and they will then be excellent places
for lnforrndl meetings. A group of
men gathered around the ﬁreplace, n
wellelrhcd facility mail or downtown
business man who has the personality
needed to inﬂuence a college group, a
short song-fest with the men about the
piano, offer possibilities for "Y" meet-
lugs as yet untouched.

The plan could at least be tried a
few weeks in difrerent club-rooms

BUILDING ONE COLD
WATER MAIN BURSTS

Considerable inconvenience was
caused at the men's dormitories Tiles—
day evening by the bursting of one of
the main cold water pipes. A defect-
ive joint gave way under the pressure
and necessitated the shutting off or
all the water in the dormitories for
most. of the afternoon.
