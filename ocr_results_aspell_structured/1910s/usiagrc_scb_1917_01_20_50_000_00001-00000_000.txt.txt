CARLETON, Mmll., Jan. 19.——Spe-
cial to The Scar-lct and Blael For
the first time in three years Carleton
college was defeated in a basketball
game tonight, and it was the Gl'ilincll
five that did the worn, 211716. The play
was ncarly equal, as far as getting
bash-eta was concerned, each side land-
ing crgbt, but Grrnnell won the game
through Swan's excellent work from
the foul line.

Gl'innell went into the game mm a
changed lineup, due to Augustine's
enforced absence. Worth was shifted
to center, and Baggc went in at for-
ward. The work or the new combina-
tion‘ was especially good in the last
half, for it was then that Grinnell won
the game. The defense was good on
both sides, but Grinnell excelled in
getting shots while Carleton made
their few trip gmld. .

Cur ,Iiul Was in Lead.

Carleton took the lead in the first
half, and clearly out-passed the Grin»
iiell team. The score at the end of
the period was 3-7 for Carleton. The
scarlet and blaclt five staged a come-
back in the second round, anti badly
outplayed their opponents. bfcaeharn
broke loose [or four bashets in this
period, and this enabled Gl'iilnell to
pirt the game on ice.

Citptnins Are stars.

The captains of the two teams put
up the best game of the evening. Welr
slions. who has b‘een Carleton’s main-
stay in past games, tossed three has-
kets, and his play was consistent
throughout. Swan got his usual counts
or, birt his toiil throwing was the best
he has shown yet. Out of five tries he
inadc four points, exactly the margin
between the scores. The whole Grim
rrcll team played a fine game, and
their work was appreciated by the
Carlcfoir router-s nho cheered for them
