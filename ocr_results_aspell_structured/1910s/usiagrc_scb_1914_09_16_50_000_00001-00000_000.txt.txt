PRES. MAIN’S ADERESS

Opening Service Draws the Larg~
est Attendance in Years
This Morning.

ADDRESS GREETS NEW CLASS

Speaking hetore toe largest crowd
i students or added in the
chapel tor a similar exercise, Presl»
dent Main gave the opening address of '
lhe year this morning, impressing
upon ‘the new Freshman class the sig»
nihcairte at their presence in the col-
lege environment, and the meaning of
the four years oi college training in
Grillnell,

In a word of welcome to the strident
body as a whole, President Main said,
"I lejolce that you are here, and that
I am here with you. This chapel is theI
central place oi the college, the center-
ot its democracy and the secret of its
power. This opening school year is
a new one in our lives. it is a new
bil‘lh [or us all."

He told the Freshmen oi the found»
ing of Gl'lllnell College, of its open»
ing in ISIS, and of its steady growth
in the past seventy years. “For sev-
entv year. rid .llr. llain, "Gl'lllllell
has been waiting for the class, that is
now seated in this chapel. '

"The campus here, the buildings.
the equipment, and all, are a more in»
dication of the greatness of Gl'lllnell.
There' is a reality here that each
Freshman must ﬁnd tor himself. The
greatness oi Gi-inriell will come to you
slowly with the passing ol years as you
go on tow-aid graduation, brrt even
their the true greatness of this college
will not be realized.

"In order to appreciate the true
value of Gi-innell you 'inust give your--
selves to yoirr work here, Then in
utter years when you have engaged iii
lite pursuits the lull Slgniftcallce oi
this college will he clear to you.

“llost of you, perhaps, have come
to Glillnell with preconceived ideas
as to your abilities and notions, They
will act as a hindrance to you in lor-
war-d progress
we all are marching lot-wart] to a
greater home. that hoiire where our
life work lies. '

Lester Fceze ll, has accepted the
position or legal assistant to the Sec»
retﬂly or the New York State Depart»
