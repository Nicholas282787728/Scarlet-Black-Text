tars-t SXlLtIl day Crinncll accepted
defeat at the hands of Dutuque. The
victory was fairly won.

But for those who tell their faith
in the ability of the Scarlet and black
team to win beginning to be put to
the test it would be well to investigate
the data 0[ Saturday's game.

According to figures published else
it herein this issue Grlnuell gained 132
yards in scrimmage and Dubuqiie 154
yards. Duhuouc made 69 yards in l'e~
turning punts while Gl'mncll totaled
87 yaids in the same way.

In other
Black had the punch. From the stand
point of ﬁght they fully equaled their
opponents.

The intensity of practice work has
increased. The freshmen are making
a special effort to give the 'varsity the
hardest kind of opposition. Men and
coaches are doing their utmost to
make every remaining game a victory.

The vi il thing is that the college
stand behind the team to a man. If
every man and woman does his or her
part as well as the members or the
football squad can be depended upon
to do theirs Gl'iulicll will be able to
celebrate a victorious football season
at Than' g ing time.

puted (taking the ﬁgures just quoted

Out of Game.

With Lhe Washington university com

the Crinnell eleven is working over-
time in order to he in the best pos-
sible shape. That this will he one of
the hardest games on the season’s
schedule is made evident by the show—
ing of the Fillers so far this fall, and
by the fact that practically all of their
3. A. T. C. champion team are. back
this year.

Last Saturday the bikers won their
ﬁrst conference game of the year, tier
fcating the strong Kansas Aggie clew
en 14 to o. The Agglcs had previously
played Missouri to a d to 5 ti . Mis-
souri defeated Amos 10 to 0, giving
Washington a fiftccn point lead over
the Scarlet and Black squad.

Loss of Whiimcr Felt.

Grinnell will be handicapped by the
absence of Whitmei, who will be im-
ablc to play because of on i ‘urcd
knee. "Whit" has been playing a
whale of a game at center, and the
forward wall will be weakened by his
absence, MCLamll will probably play
enter, and Daubeubergcr, who went
‘into the Dubudtie game, may be used
at Red's tackle. Schultz who is sure
faring from an injury to Lil the, may
also be unable to get into the game,

The Film , who were, M uri val.

foremost honors again this year, and
based on their showing so for their
chances are good.
