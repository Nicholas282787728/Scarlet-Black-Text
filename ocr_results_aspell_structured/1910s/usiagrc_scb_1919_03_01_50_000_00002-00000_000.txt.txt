SOCIAL LIFE.

It is certainly, not to be regietted,
hutrathei atact over which to he 1-
joiced that another toi ard step, even
the small, has been taken 111 G1innell 5
social life. When the junior class re—
jected the timeworn "kid party" in
tavor of a more digniﬁed form at en—
tertainment it served due notice to the
"outside world" that it was in step
with the onward march of progress
which should at all times typify Grin-
nell lite.

Kid parties, hard time socials and
the like have run their race in Grine
itcll. All such affairs seem to have re-
ceived their death blow with this late
est action of the class of '20.

in the average middle western city
the community affords a social life
which fulﬁlls the demands of the
young living there. Theaters and
valiolls otbel high glade places of
amusement form an essential pait of
the iespectlvc local life

Few theatrical attractions can he
brought to a town the size of Grlnnell,
for only occasionally are the people in
a position to support there. There re-
mains, therefore, nothing except tile
movie, and even the best of movies.
such as we have at the local theaters,
grow tiresome after a time. So we
have only to decide whether we shall
go to the movies, or whether we shall
go to the movies.

Naturally, therefore, it falls upon
the college to furnish a torm oi amuse
ment which is acceptable and pleasing
to the greater majority of its students.

This is a crucial time in the history
at Grinnoll. One misstep on the part
of thc administration would have a
decidedly injurious cttect on the rue
turc ot the college. It is so with every
institution at this time more than ever
hetore. 0n the other hand, a step in
the r glit direction will work wonders
toward the rebuilding and strengthen-
ing at the college alter the difficult
period thru which it has just passed,
and will have a far-reaching effect
\lhicil can he telt tliiu years to come.

social lite of the right kind is a
highly essential part at any college.
Just now, ttiat institution which “gets

, the jump” will he THE institution for
the liiturc, but the college which re—
tuscs tn progi- .5 must slowly. liut
surely, close its doors.

NAMING THE COTTAGE'

Grinnell men, of late, have been
quite insistent upon the subject of
their desire to have their buildings
named appropriately. Perhaps across
the campus the girls at the quadrangle
want the same personality and indivul»
iiality added to their “college homes."
Altho “cottage" has a little more of a
homclike atmosphere ahout it than
“building," still a name like “lIears
Cottage” will always carry more as-
sociations with it than "Two" or
“Five.”

There are as many ﬁne Grinnell W07
men as men under whose names the
gii-ls' cottages might go. In many
schools a r inctivc name for each
house or dormitory means much My
waid the development of inrlividual
standards and ideals. So while the
names are being chosen tor the dormi-
toiics, cannot the quadrangle come in

for its share at blessings?

NSSON REFUSES GOLD
MEDALS.

When three prominent national goo-

societies sought to honor

SLGTQDSSDII, recently, [01'
his distinguished achievements in the
arctic regions, by awarding him gold
medals, they met with an unexpected
l'esponse from the great cxplorer.
Courteously the latter ieqiiested them
to have the medals struck in bronze
instead or in gold, and to allow him
the dittcrence in cash between the cost
of the two medals.

Astonished though they were at ﬁrst,
when they heard his reasons the men
who sought to honor him gladly ac-
ceded to his appaieiitly uiigracious
suggestion. 111-. stotansson explained
that he wanted the money sent to tho
widowed mother or the late Henri
Beauchat, iii Fiance, to a. .t in the
maintenance ct her and her lamily.

Bcauchat was the authiopologist
of the last stctanssou arctic cxpcde
ticu and w..' fiozeii to death
after the sinking or the Kar ik
r. dowed mother has hcen iii dcspcr
ate straits since his death. To add to
licr inistortnues lici- Sollrillrlzllv was
lulled in the war, and her daughter
has licoomc a chronic invalid.

"The value of the medals would be
the same to me whether they new of
bronze or gold," .\lr. Stetansson ex-
plained, with a smile. “And how much
hotter it would lid 11‘ the unhappy films
ily 111 my old comrade could reap the
heucltt ot‘ the (ll'llcl'cucc in their cost."

This has tincn done. Last December

stiiwcd on Mr. stcrttusson the "Daly"
iiictlul, 111 Janh 'y the National Goo-
ginptiic Sccteti awiidcd him the Hub-
