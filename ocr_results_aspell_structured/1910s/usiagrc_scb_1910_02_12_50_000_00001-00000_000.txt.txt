15‘ to 13. Close guarding and more
actuiate passing on the part ot the
Scdl'let and Black Tire accounted ior
the victory The Grinnell team was
playing in tiprtop ior-in and in the first
lew minutes played the Hull'lieye ﬁve
all their icet. Baskets in quick sub-
ccssioii by B. .7, Carney and Slutz put
G nhell in the lead ior the entire
game. ioiva iought hard to overcome
the lead, and at one time were within
L\l'0 points oi tying up the score, but
a sensational basket by siutn gave
Gl'inncll a margin oi three points at
the end or the ﬁrst liali. The ﬁrst per-
iod ended: Griiinell, ltl, lona, 7.

The same lineups raced each other
at the beginning oi the second liali.
lowa came hack strong and ior five
minutes oi the hardest kind oi playing,
neither team was able to score. slutz
broke the spell with a brilliant basket
lrom the center oi the held, and role
lowed with another almost instantly.

t this juncture oi the game, time was
taken out on account oi a slight injury
to B, Carney, who was playing u won»

hraced desperately, and ior a tow min-
utes the Grinuell men were hewildered
by the accurate passing and excellent
team work at the lows ﬁve. By some
oi the prettiest door work oi the even-
ing, Schmidt edged the only two held
goals scored by Iowa in the second
liali. The game was marred consider
ably hy roughness on both sides and
thereieree was iorced to eliminate

irorn the contest. This slowed the
work oi both teams porceptibly, and
no iiirther scoring resulted on either
side.

The game throughout was characters
ited by the ﬁerce struggle oi each man
wit hhis opponent, and this resulted in
considerable roughness which added
some spectacular interest but little to
the quality or the game, The work oi:
the tirinneli guards was the feature oi
the play; hath hicEachi-on and Carney

strong game, and was the main iorce
in hreaklug up the Iowa teamwork.

work for Grinncll, edging hve haskets
