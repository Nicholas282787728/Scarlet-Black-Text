In 1897 the Scarlet and Black. met
Amos with the determination or winmg
out the 72-0 detect of the year before.
C. E. Ham-1s uf the class or '96 de-
scribes the game:

”It I See Grinnell play football for
twenty-ﬁve years I expect never again
to see a. Scarlet and Black team keyed
to such a pitch of fighting [renzy as
that which laced Amos in ’97. Nor
are any or us likely to see such a
heart—orcahing tinish. With the score
1276 in our favor Allies, vastly super-
ior in weight, placed the ball on our
five-yard line with ﬁve seconds left
to play, and the two teams standing
directly under the goals. A touch
down meant a. certain tie. Failure
meant die sweetest victory Gl'iuuell
ever tasted. All hinged on one play.
Dyer, the Aggie fullback, came crash-
ing into the left tackle Opening; the
line opened momentarily. Dyer was
met by the i-eduubtztble Bertie Gray,
Grihhell’s left half, and the game end-
ed with the ball on our two-yard line."

In 1914. Grillnell experienced per
haps the most disastrous tootball sea—
son in her history. Coe had piled I111
cighty-tiv’c points against the Scarlet
and Black and only one Victory had
brightened the course or the schedule.
According to custom the last game or
the season was with Cornell. The
dope was overwhelmingly in [aver at
Cornell and the sport sagcs prophesied
an easy victory for the Purple and
White“

The game was played on Saturday.

big "pep-feasts” in the history of the
