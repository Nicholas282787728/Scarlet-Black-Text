Director Pierce is to he heartily

commended on the inethott ho has
chosen ior providing seats at the Hot-
ntann recital next Friday. some time
ago iear arose that there would not he
seats enough ior those who hold see
mester iee tickets, especially when it
was discovered that there were only
752 places ior 799 holders or the ices.
Now, however, the diiiiculty seems to
have been oiercoine, ior- a time at
least. ‘

The method he has chosen is one to
antee a seat tor each semester tee
holder. Nu tickets are to be sold to
town people until alter eight o’clock
on the night or the concert. Aiter that
time any vacant seat may he reserved
by any outsider tor a given price.
Proicssor Pierce is keeping a list oi
those who will he on hand to buy a
ticket, and sales will he made in the
order or application.

The above method is one or iairnese
to all. The holder oi a semester tee
ticket should by all means receive
iii-st consideration. This is given hr
allowing him to take any unoccupied
seat in the house hciorc eight o'clock,
when the opening number is to be

gltar

played.
The method taltes the town people

Sundays issue oi the body Iowdtu
contained lengthy comment upon an
editor l in Salt day‘s Scarlet and
Black entitled "The Brutal in Foot
hell." Alter quoting the editorial iri‘
iull the iowan s

“The ahove editorial, which appears
ed in The Scarlet and Black at Grin-
ncll College yesterday morning, shows
what Grinnell thought nhout Iowa lie-
rcre the game, antl the general opin»
ion that i stitution or learning has roi-
Iowa athletics in general. The Daily
rowan must commend The Scarlet and
Black ior matting a plea tor elcen
sportsmanship among her athletes, cv-
en though their opponents are oi the
’kill and cat v out' type oi men who
stand ior ‘whili. is hrutal iii allilctios.‘
We iecl, lioirerer, that the assertions
made against the athletes oi the Uni-
versity are entirely unwarranted and
without foundation. Iowa did not play
Grinnell in looihali last year, so iL'
must be some ancient grudge upon
which they are now iiarpii gipel'hnps‘
one which has been handed down to
them rrom generations past. i t s «

the shore seems to indicate that eren
the state University has hton a little
scliutoiiseious on this point. For in;
stance, in the tiuotation it will he no-
ticctt that the Daily low-on ttoes not
emphatically deny that such a reputa-
tion has existed in the past. It is only
said that the assertions made against
her present roothall team by The Scar-1
let and Black “arc entircly unwarrant—
ctl anti without iouiidation," As to
iowa's past reputation ior roughness,
iro nu t 0): t that it has cnistod; as
to a brutal element in last Satur-
day s game, we must admit that there
was practically none.

To tell the truth, we were agreeably
sin-p sett in the kind or sportsmanship
shown in the game the other day. It
was or a kind any college or univer-
sity might well he proud, Naturally
a certain amount oi roughness must
appear in any hard fought contest, anti
prchahly did hceome eridcnt at Iowa
City, hut as a whole there was no
hrutal element in the game. it was
clean throughout and played accords
iiig to the highest standards in ath-
leties. Each side t ed to ii'n by [not
hall skill, the proper way [Orally team
to. ﬁve ior victory. For that ire calls
gratiilotc lowa athletes as well as our
own. We rcioiee that otir own state
in,titution has succeeded in attaining
such a standard and hope they may
continue to maintain it:

THOSE l-‘H'Ii FORWARD PASS

“The Grinneil touchdown come as
the climax to some of the most hril-
liant and spectacular playing oi the
aitcrnocn, Five toru-ard passes, all
or them successiul and all at them on
siiecessiie play-s, were utilized to talte
the ball over. The r at these went
irom watt to Augustine irom the
middle oi the iicld and was good for
20 yards. Another tlip trom Wait to
Gottys was good ior it) more and a
third added 5 yards. Itei-c Watts
pushed a iourth to ugiistliie that went
to the Iowa 7 yard line. and with the
Gi'iliuell stands clamoring wildly ior
a touchdown against the Universit-
eleven. \l’aus tried another forward‘
pass which went to Barrett standing
on the tar side oi the last white line.
The assortment oi passes tlentoralized
the second string hacltiieltl which was
playing detcnse tor the Hawkeyes alid’
every play went or: with remarkable
smoothness. IL was a touchdown earn-
cd without question by sheer llrillir
ancc.”7Thc Daily rowan.

The first High school Decirtmittory
contest or the year will take place
Saturday evening in the high school
auditorium when the ﬁrst div ion

with almost nothing ltnown oi the ‘
strength or Boloit and with the local
team crippled, Grimicll goes to the
Wisconsin college town next. Saturday
with the hope that they can bring
home a victory.

The only idea that can be gained as
to Beloit's team is that a year ago
they were ens y tlcieated licie hy a '2.)
to it score. At that time the Grinnell
team was inexperienced and tlic Beloit
squad it s seemingly iieak. H tn
are no stronger this year an easy rie
any can he iooltcd.

a inncll's luck in toothall has re-
ccived a iatal htow since ”Fill/i \ att
hecainc the rietini or a very scr
injury received in last Saturday s
game, The exact eaitsc oi the iniuiy
is unknown, hut it is thought that he
lids either hurstcd or clogged a hlood
vessel, An operation was portornied
last night, and his memory is not cxs
pectcd until atter the Geo game. “'ali.‘
is the iirst man this year to he put
out oi the game on account oi inju es.

The loss or \t'att will materially
weaken the team, ior ho is the surest
man on the squad to receive punts,
Jesse Day will pilot the team against
Boloit, anti undouhtodty will prore to
he as good a tiold general as Watt,
hut he is unahlc to hurt torward pass
es and cannot run a broken iield as
Watt did. “Dick" Schulz will play,
the liali teit vacant by De . He will
prove a valuable man. ior he is iast ‘
can throw torirard passes, and ii necs‘
cssary can punt, as he is Augustine's
tinder-study in that line.

The rest oi the tcain will remain
intact with Railety and Getty, tight-l
ing ior right end. lta'itety proved to
he too light ior the Iowa game, but,
against average ends he can holtl his
own. Getty-s is inexperienced, but the
lawn game probably gare him neccs-,
al'y practice which will prove value
able for the rest or the season, He is
especially good in picking the pigskin>
out or the air.

With “Dad” Hoyt getting hack into‘
last years term the line looks as
strong as any in the state. sinith did‘
ieniailtnhly irell in the last game furl
heiiig a. new man, and “Dad" will have;
to improve greatly to heat him out oi
the tackle position. Smith, Osgood,‘
and Hoyt are as good as any trio or
tackles in the state. i

Martin anti Wires played strong
games and icr~ seldom permitted the
line to he punctured. McAlmoll is llllr‘
DI'OHHg at guard, but must lictpiire
