ci-ess betore a large audience.

“I aslt the dueslion; have you a will
that will push your physical strength

it through to the end?" rid the Fresh
dent in opening his tallt. "That. is the
spirit that saves ttie world t i slazr
nation, that serves it, the spi t that
has titted nien irom the shell heaps,
irom the cave dwellings. That is the
spirit that will vindicate your 'ght to|
live.”

"The will to do is heroic in all life,"
the speaker continued. “It is the dead
wall or impossibility that makes the
will to do interesting. inst tnat thing
that makes lite in some measure heroic.
Lite doesn't consist in knocking down
straw men, but it does consist in clear-
ing up the mountains and wildern scs
hetero you in many guises."

“I pray that vou will not lind life
easy. iiy prayer ror you is that ,\' w
ill ﬁnd lire hard, but have the hero
spirit to rejalce in the hardness and
victory. The tli icultics or tile, even
the impossibilities, are the lirst ele-
ments oi success Success is the pro-

cess oi knocking the diiiiculties out.

“Do you ltnow that there are mil»
lions oi un -ptored regions in the
world ior you said the President in
concluding. 'I‘llel'e are unnumbered
regions where the creative spirit is de-
manded. The world s waiting tor pion-
eers. or course you will meet ridicule
and opposition, but the will to do at-
Ways meets ridicule and considers it
part 01 tile ilav each one or you be
one who never turns his bank.“

The national 2th yard dash, brought
about by agitation on the part at Dralte

week, and it is announced that Smith

ing oi Chicago, Carter of Wisconsin.
Earlier at Northwestern, Holmes or

tically certain to be entered. These
men probably represent the best tur-

event will draw the widest interest

Predictions have been scattered all
