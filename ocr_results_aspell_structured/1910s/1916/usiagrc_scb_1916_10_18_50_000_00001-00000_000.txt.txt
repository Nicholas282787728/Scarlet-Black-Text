one more play oi the highest standard
Dramatic critics all Ol'el' the counti

not able to reach an agreement cori-
coming the time or holding debates or

ruled that those schools would enter a
now triangular league (or this year.
such a league was discussed at some

A book containing nothing, but Grin—
nell songs is the latest ellurt being
published by the College Ofﬁce. This
will be ready for distribution :hortly
before Christmas.

The plan is to have the first edition
contain all of the songs which have
originated in Grinnell or which have
become an inherent part of the Col-
lege music. Already a list 0! some
thirty havejdeen collected and several
more are to he added at once. Most of
these have been written by local mn-
sicians and are of value on that ac<
count. Many are songs which are un»
known to the present generation of
Grinnell students, While others are
those composed since the graduation
or torn-ior men and women,

Detailed plans for the book are near
ly Completed, but it is desired that any
others not yet in the collection and oi
any value as student songs should be
included in this first edition. These
shuultl be ones \vthll have either Orig—
indted in Gl'inhell Dr which have be-
come an inherent part of the College
music. The llst of songs which follows
is as complete as it is possible to ar-
range at present. It ’therc are any
others when should be included, it is
hoped that alumni and student: Win
report them to the office of the School

end of a 17 to 7 score on Iowa field
