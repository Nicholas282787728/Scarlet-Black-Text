ALL GIHLS’ SIIDIEIIES
AIJIIPI BUSHING RULES

ilii Meetings.

Rushing rules, radically ditterent

trom any formerly used in thc socie-
ties, were adopted by Caloca; Phi
Delph, Aegis, Ellis, and sorosis, at
their regular business meetings on
Friday otternoon:
» Democracy and time tor unbiased
Judgment, both trom the standpoint of
the society and non-society girl, are
emphasized in the new rules. Pre-
vious to this action upper-cls s girls
coiiid be tolien in at the beginning of
the year, Rushing, in the accepted
meaning oi the term and in the re-
stricted sense as used in Griunell, was
forbidden by the inter-society rules
adopted yesterday. ,

The plan which has just been (lav
vised, is to divide the non-society girls
into (iv groups and to have each
group v7 t, in rotation, the tive (Ills
icrent societies. Every society girl is
to be assigned, by lot, one girl irom
each group whom she is to invite and
take to the open meetings which occur
twice a month. Besides giving the
uon-memhcrs a lair and niiprcindiccd
view or the various societies, the plan
is thoroughly democratic. It is hoped
it will do awav with the hesitation oi
somegii-ls to Visit a. societyoi which
they are not members.

Atter’all ilie societies have been vise
itctl in this way, the ioriner non-ru‘sh»
ing rules hold. ’0 Freshman can lie
talien into a society. i\'o mempcr can
take her invited guest to a meeting, or
show any extraordinary attention ot-
ter the invitation has hecn extended.
These rules hold until alter Chi-ist-
mas. when the next term oiriccrs are
elected, and members may- be taken

with the adoption oi the new society
rules, nos held by Calocagathinn socis

The results of the interelass series
last spring gave Ben Ellsworth, '19,
the singles championship. During the
summer he was easily defeated by Ed
Pottle, '17, iii the Central iowa tourna—
ment. Ralph Mom-head, '13, would
prohobly be the most likely winner,
hut as yet he has not returned to'
school. From the Freshman class

looked upon as the best prospect.
