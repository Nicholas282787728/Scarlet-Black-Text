Fourteen hundred and fifty dollars
had been pledged by Grinnell stirderits
and faculty members up to six o'clock
last night for the relief of prisoners
in the war camps of Europe. The
greater part of the money was raised
in at Chapel service for this purpose
yesterday morning, at which Profes-
sors Evans and Steiner, and two stii»
dents, J. B. MacGrcgor and Mary Stim-
son, were the speakers

individual pledges ai-eraged two dol»
lars. Many, liowevcr, exceeded that
amount, ranging from five to ten dolsl
lars, and one amounted to twenty dol»
lars. it is eapected that may contri-
bution i ll be paid within a few days,
after which the money ivill be for-—
warded to the secretary of the inter»
national Y. M. C. A. committee in New
York City. Supplies, colisisting of ya»
rious articles of food and clothing. will
then be purchased and forwarded mi»
mediately to the prison camps. No
money will be retained either here or
in New York for administrative pur—
Doses. -

Dr. Evans in his speech laid great
emphasis on the ter-ible conditions
which prevail in the war camps, not
only among the allies, but to an equal
extent among the Germans, Hungari»
ans: and Turks. "One of the greatest
factors of the war," he declared. “IS
the fact that there are six million
prisoners among the three thousand
prison camps of Europe, scattered
from France to Serbia, Three hun»
dred thousand college men are
eluded in this number, for they were
among the first to respond to the can
to war. Only the poorest food and
the coarsest clothing are allowed
them, and some have not even been
permitted a change of clothing since
their capture."

Dr Steiner made a plea for large
contributions, stating that less had
been done for the prisoners than for
any other class of people affected b,
the par. Their need, he declared, was
equally, as great. J. B. AiacGi-egor and
iliary Stimson responded in a direct
appeal to the men and Women of the
College.

The total budget of the war prisoner
fund to be raised by the National Y.

had in eastern institutions caused the
amount to be raised to a quarter of a

in this way more dormitories can be
built at any time, and it is probable
that three more will be constructed
next ‘car if the first ones prov-c pop»
iilar with the men. As the money for
these buildings is all derived from
bond issues, the construction of dor»
mitorres in no way interferes with or
postpones the building of a new gym:
nasiiini, a music hall, or a science
hall. These other buildings, not being
income producing, cannot be paid for
by a bond 'ssiie, but the con. motion
of the dormitories takes no funds from
the college endowment. As soon as
gifts are received by the College in
sufficient ainouuts to assure the cons
struction of other buildings they will
be erected, irrespective of thc number
of doi-mitoiies being built. it is more
than probable that one new college
structure will be started next year,

dciiis For ‘tiets.

Although it has always been the
policy of the admin stration to op-
pose fiatcinities and sororities, nev-
cilheless it is manned that an agita-
tioii for the former has been started
in Giiiiiicll by several students proin»
iiient in college activities.

in eicry case when a similar agita-
tion has been brought up in the past
it has utterly failed in its purpose on
account of the strict decree of the ad-
ministration against fraternities and
sororities. This time, as formerly, the
College emphatically states that there
will positively be none of them in
Grinnell. T s is final, according to
the authorities.

Ll‘illli‘l‘s Write Lama's.

The agitation, as it is being eariicd
on, is interesting. Letters have been
written, or are being written to the
pi osidents of prominent colleges
where fraternities are allowed. The
exlcrior purpose of this con spend»
once, as far as can be ascertained is
to get reliable information concerning
the benefits or injuries resulting from
fraternitrc in colleges. When conch.»
sivc material has been collected, the
leaders in the movement will probably
present it to the college authorities.

After answers are received from the
various colleges, prominent alumni
iiill be approached ou the question.
The combined results of consulting
alumni and college presidents may
either iiigc, or discourage, the leaders
mm bringing another phase of college
life into Griniiell.

By “D ’ g open the lid" as much
as possible, one plan of the agitators
was found. it is such that they would
hi e two cottages iii the new men's
dormitories converted into ' rat"
house They argue that fraternities
cannot harm Gi-iiinell, due to the at»
uiosphorc and spirit that is so well
established here, it is the sincere be»
not of these students that fraternities
would not injure democracy and that
Griniicli needs them in order to fur»
nish social functions that will divert
from the monotonous part .s now
hold. The College authorities disagree
with them in (his respect.

This question has been discussed
quite frequently among the students,
cspocially by the men. already two
of the men literary -ocleli s have
heard speeches advocating fraternities
for Grinncll. iiaiiy of those who heard
this attitude became personally inter--
ested in the question. Just how far
the fraternity agitation will be carried
depends upon the correspondence re»
ceivcd from the communications to

 

alumni and college presidents.

The Grinncll sruiad is working hard
to get into shape for the final game
of the season with Cornell on Friday,
November 24. The contest will decide
the conference championship. Today
the football mcii are enjoying an open
date for the first time this year.

Last Thursday the varsity played
the Frcshincu in a game of two fif—
tecn minute babes. At tiic end of the
contest the score stood 12»f. in favor of
the varsity. all during the first half,
the entire line of the scarlet and black
was composed of substitutes. on this
account, the ycarluig backfield gained
through the opposing line at will, and
pushed Fraser over for a touchdown.
Thcy failed to kick goal,

Forward PﬂSSK‘S Work Well.

\thn the first st 'ng men were
rushed in at the beginning of the sec-
ond half, the Freshmen could not make
appreciable gains. "Fuzz" and “Mike"
worked together at forward passes,
that netted two touchdowns. In both
cases Augustine failed to kick goal.
The varsity made their last touchdown
within two minutes after receiving the
kickoff. with a series of end runs
and aerial passes the final six points
were made just before the whistle
blew.

At present, everybody on the squad
is rceorcring from all injuries and
bri acs that they may have received
this season. The only man on the
hospital list is Gingles, who is nurs<
mg an infected leg; but with a full
week to recover, he Will be in readi<

By defeating Penn yesterday, Cor—
ncli still remain. with Grinneil as an
undefeated toa i in the conference.
Nevt Saturda- the Methodists tackle
the fast Coo to n, and Grinncil meets
Penn. Either one of these games may
proved stumbling block to either Cor.
iioll or Griiiucli, but should both teams
ivin fi om their opponents, the contest
here November 1i \\\II prove the de-
cisrl‘e game in the race for the confer—
ence championship.

in the coming week Coach McAlmoD
will put the i .iiy under stitf scrim-
mage with the lTl'cslllilo-i, The p .
mary object of these contests is to
give tlic new men on the team experi-
ence that cannot be "a cd unless-they
are enabled to participate in real foot-

Among the Freshmen that have been
playing against the va iiy there have
appeared seicral men of real football
calibre. Joe biarklcy ins been able to
penetrate thc varsity line as often as
many of the men the scarlet and black
have met this year on the gridiron.
Another fast halfback is non McMu
ray. who has been pia ing a great
game for the yearnngs, on the de-
fcnse. Fraser at oiiartcr has run his
team in good shape and returns punts
in an admirable mariner. Playing at
left end nay Dimit has more than once
stopped tlic long end runs of the var-
sity. lie is very shifty and difficult
to "clip." The entire Freshman team
has offered better opposition to the
rarsity than several of thc colleges
the arlct and black ltas played this
year.
