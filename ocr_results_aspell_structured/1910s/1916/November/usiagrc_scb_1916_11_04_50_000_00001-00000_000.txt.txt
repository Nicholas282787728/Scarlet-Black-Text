“Every human being in his develop

interesting anti highly entertaining
talk by Dr. TV. S. Hall at Chapel
Thursday.

Beginning with the earliest stages
of man's dcvclopnicnt, arid tracing his
history through sul'agcl‘y, barbarism,
and the age of Chivalry, he drew a very
clever and wholly logical analogy in
the youth of today.

BATTLE WITH DRAKE

in Eight Contests.

When Grilulcll and Drake line up
tor their aunual‘gridiron battle today,
it will he the twentyrtirst tirirc that
these ancient rivals have met on the
toothall iield. The iii-st game between
the two schools was played nineteen
years ago, Grinnell winning out by a
30 to 0 score,

A glance hackward over the years
reveals the iact that Drake has been
triumphant in thirteen games, while
Grinnell has returned victor in eight.
There have liocn no tie scores. Ale
though the pine and white have a
slight advantage in games won, Grin-
hell's glory appears no less diru when
the ditterence in the size 01 the two
schools is considered. With this tact

who have won these eight games.
Drake Made More I'oin .
Sallie interesting ”dope" may he
gained by or study of past scores. In
tho twenty games Drake has scored
a total of 306 points, while Grinncll

agc in points scorcd is accounted for
by the tact that whenever victorious,
she usually has run up a iairly large
score, at the some time "whitewash-

Arc in Good Condition.

With a patcllcdrup hacklicld, Crin-
nell presents itselt against Dr-alto to-
day in the worst condition the scarlet
and hlitck has tonnd itsell yet this
year, Captain Barrett's hand has been
in such bad condition that he has not
even been out in a suit all week. Be-
sides “Brat," Day and Schulz are on
the hospital list with various injuries. .

The injury that Jesse Day received
last Tuesday has proven to he more
serious than it appeared at ﬁrst. Ai-
ter a thorough examination, it was
round that Day received such a hard
hlow in his hack that he was atteeted
internally. He has not been allowed
to participate in any scrlnon’iages this
week, Thursday alter-noon was the
first time that Schulz was ahlc to ap-
pear even in signal practice His
right leg still hothers him and he is
unable to get around on it with speed.
However, with Day on the hospital
list, it will he almost necessary that
“Dick” start this atteriioon's contest
at right halt. Grant, who escaped trend
the Coe game without serious hatter-
ing, will appear in Barrett’s halt.

)lucli Depends on “Mike."

"Mike" is as good'as ever at full-
back, and should prove a power in
both deiciise and ortensc against the
hluc’ and white. He has kept up are
same spectacular printing all week,
and much will depend upon his ahility
to send spirals as high and tar as he
did at Coe.

For the iii-st time since the Iowa
game, "Fuz ,. \Vatt is in good physi<
cal condition. He will be able to run
punts this atternoon in the satire style

 

which he showed earlier in the sea‘

The Bulldogs will undoubtedly rise

Coach Glaze has been drilling the
Drake team behind closed go. but it
has looked out that he is placing all
his energies towards building up a
thorough system or aerial passing. The
open play that -ill hc used by both
teams will iurnislr an exciting game
for spectators. It would not he a sur»

According to Dial: a coaches, the
team is in the best shape that it has
been in all the year. The Northwest-
