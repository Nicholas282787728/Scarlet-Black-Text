These were the opinions that greet-

struction of a Women’s Quadrangle.
the iirst step in Grinnell's great build-
ing campaign, two years ago last
spring.

All were agreed that such a group
ct buildings was a nccessity. Grin-
nell’s enrollinent had grown to such
iigurcs that some provision tor housing
the women was imperative if the Cole
lege was to maintain its distinctive
character. For years a new home for
Ike women had been planned; it had
been discussed at every meeting oi the
Bonrd‘of Trustees; it had been in-
cluded in every report of the Presi—
dent. But the same nnanswerablc ar-
gument had come up each time _ the
College had no funds tor the purpose.
True, the endowment lied been in
creasing at an encouraging pace, but
it was all needed to increase the
equipment in the laboratories and li-
brary, fur professors‘ salar s, and for
general cvpenses necessitated by a
rapid increase in enrollment.

proposed a plan which had long been
in his mind. As a result The Griunell
College Foundation was organized as
a distinct corporation, and‘wllll the

The next step was a Recitation Hall.
The Alumni Council had often discuss
on undertaking some big ontornr e.
and as a recitation building w par

would mean more to him than to an
outsider, it was most litting that the
alumni undertake the financing or
such a building. A ﬁnance committee

lllllers to Follow Before

By President J. H. ’1‘. Main.

The building program or Grinnell
College is one that is based upon ceiu
tain dciinite ideals or education and
lite. These ideals as related to the
\Voniens Quadrangle have been dis-
cussed at various times and in various
publications It is not necessary to
repeat them 'here. The ideals that are
to he observed in building the Mens
Quadrangle have been carefully stu~
died and the buildings. we believe, will
adequately embody them.‘

The Alumni Recitation Hall exem-
pliiies, in a building primarily tor edu-
icatlonal purposes, the same (update
mental idea. This building is for non-
lahoratory subjects. For that reason
it was deemed essential that it should
be near the Library. Not only that.
It was deemed essential that it should
be connected by a commodioiis corri-
dor. This connection was made, In
the interior arrangement it was de-
cided that the ofﬁces, the roeitation
rooms, largo and small, should have
all possible iacilitics tor study and
class room needs. it was also decided
that it should have an audience room
ior “Community" purposes. it was
ielt, moreover, that it should he' a

for the highest. ideals of training and
education that Gl'ilmell is eager to
achieve.

Other buildings for educational pur—
poses will tollow in order, and in near ,
relation along Eighth Avenue east,
and than on an avenue through the -
campus towards the south. Three ad-
ditional buildings are planned tor this
group, all immediately iiocessaiy, In
the order of their possible location
they are as follows: A building tor
Physics and Mathematics; is building
ior the biological Sciences; it builds
mg for Chemistry,

These buildings are each necessary
at this time. It is impossible to over-
emphasize the need for them, Every
citort is being made to secure funds
for their erection. They will be built
in accordance with ideals similar to'
those illustrated in the Alumni Reci-
taiion Hull. They will each be the
subject of special study with 2t View
to making them adequate for the pres-
ent day and for an indefinite future.
This group of three hllildlllgs should

cost not less than $400,000. ,
