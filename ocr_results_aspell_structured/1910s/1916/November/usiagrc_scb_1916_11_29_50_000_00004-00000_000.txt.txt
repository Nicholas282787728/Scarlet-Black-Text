That definite ll'ol‘k’llpun the con-
sti-uelion ot a new music and tine arts
building, which will outr'nal any sin
lai- structure in the middle west, will
begin within two years, was learned
from the College author ies yester-
day. Worlt will probably begin during
the present school year, but certainly
not later than 1913. It is also planned
to erect a new men’s ~mnasiiun short-
ly aitci- its completion. The latter
building will be constructed just south
of the running track, and will be mode
ern in‘ every detail. A large swimming
pool will be one of its tcatui-o .

Will Be On South

Thc music building it l consi
three units. one each for music, the
arts, and a studio or oilice building.
They will be arranged on tho south
campus in the tom of a semi-circle
and will be connected by an open-dil‘
corridor, the center ot,wliich will be
an' Italian court. The new plan will
provide a centralization of all the inn-
sical work of the College.

New] its irelneiidous.

Demand for better equipment in this
department has been veiy urgent for
a number or years, but owing to a lack
of funds construction has been deter-
red. The building now in use is one
of the oldest on the campus, having
been erected shortly after the cyclone
in issz, and at present it is entirely
inadequate to meet the needs of the
department. It has even been found
necessary to use Chicago Hall as an
overflow. The new structure will be
modern in every respect, and will he
built according to latest designs in an
chitecture or that type. Alumni Hall,
as the present School of Music is cum-
monly hnown. will not be torn down,
but will he slightly remodeled and
used exclusively as a society hall.

A new structure is needed badly.
One reason tor the necessity ot the
new building is shown in the increas-
ing number or the faculty each year.
A1. present twelve instructors are em—
ployed, tour vocal and eight instru-
mental, and plans are under consider-
ation to materially increase that mime
