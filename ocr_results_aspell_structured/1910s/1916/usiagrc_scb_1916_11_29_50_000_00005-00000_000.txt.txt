When the question, “Why did you

conic to Grinnelli". was recently asked ‘

of ten prominent Grinnell men, they
replied almost without exception, “l3e~

cause it is one of the best Liberal Al'tsl

colleges in the middle west."

one man who was interwewed said,
“i visited all the leading Liberal Arts
institutions in Iowa, and the most
prominent ones in neighboring states.
As a result I am thoroughly convinced
that Grinnell offers the best opporu—
nities for a Liberal Arts education of
any institlltiou in the middle west."

Many of the men thought that Grill-
‘llell alumni appealed to them more
than did the alumni of other institu-
tions. Often times the influence of.
some high school teacher was the de-
termining factor iil their choice of a
college. i

The organization or fraternity called

Locill Cllupler In 1907.

 

Until 1907. the state University‘ot
Iowa was the only institution in the
state which had a chapter of the na-
tional organization. During that year,
Iowa College, or Grinnell as it is now
known, applied to the National Colllb
on for membership. On September
12, 1907, at a meeting of the National
Council at the Society Lleld at Will-
iamsbul‘g, Va., Iowa College was unau»
lmously granted a chapter in Phi Beta,
Kappa fraternity. There are at pres
out about seventy such chapters in the
colleges and universities at the United
States. Iowa has two of these, Alpha.
Chapter at Iowa University, and Beta
Chapter at Grilnlell.

Churn-r )[elllbcrs Selected.

When the charter was granted, a
committee composed of President I.
H. Main, Professor H. W. Norris, Prn<
lessor C. E. Millet-d and Professor Jes
so Macy “ere delegated to choose the
charter members of Beta Chapter. A
few of these charter members were:
President J. H. T. Main, Professor H.
\V. Norris, G. E. White, R. l Fletcher,
James Hill, Mary Chamberlain, and
Professor Jesse Macy.

The influence of Phi Beta Kappa is
due, not to the maintenance of a high
standard of scholarship. hut to the 3L4
titllde which the society takes toward
a better and richer development along
all lines ot intellectual acluevemeat.
