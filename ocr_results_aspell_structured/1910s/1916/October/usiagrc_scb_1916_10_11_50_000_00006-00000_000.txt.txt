will bring home a victory next Satin» 1"“1'
day. But the season is much earlier
than at that memorial game last year,
and the team has not hit the stride
that it bad then. Besides that, the
team lacks the wonderful ottensrrc
work ot "Red" lichai-oir on the line.
Grmneli expects strong opposition
rrom Iowa, and Iowa hnows it will rt»
eeivc on unrelenting opposition from
Grinnell.

Teams have been chosen for the in.
tcrcloss mired doubles tournament to
be played on th week and next.

Ettcll class enter two teams to com-
nctc with the other three classes. The
tolll'litrliicnt will he won by the one
getting the most points, each match
counting One.

The Senior teams include Lorna
Palmer and Ralph Potlle, rvrnirretl
Almy and Arthur Parsons. Birth inl-
lel' and Floyd Staiishc y, and Iieleu
Simmons and llaroltl Falikc represent
the Jlrnio The Sonhoinores lizwje
picket! Mn orie Frinlt and Dudley
. Cowtren, Louise Peel: and Senor-man
to play tor their class honors. The
Freshman teams are Marian Garland
and Dchlytci', Esther Roberts and
Brim-1y,

The outcome or the tournament will
be well worth watching, since all the
class teams seem to be unusually
strong. it is the first athletic event
or this kind to be held in Grinnell, and
it merits support. The tournament is
being managed by Ruth Gingles, ’19,
tr-om the w. A. A .Boartl, and Ralph
Pottle, '17.
