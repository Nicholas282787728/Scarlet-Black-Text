IS SUBJECT i ' CHAPEL

The lrto and works oi Rahindrauath
Tagore, the ”Shakespeare oi India,"
was the subject ot an interesting Cho-
pel tallt hy Professor Ryan yesterday
morning. The great Hmdoo poet gave
a lecture at Iowa City Thursday night
which Professor Ryan attended, and
yesterday he conveyed his impressions
to the Grinnell student body in Cha—
pel. ‘

Tagore was characterized as a
"propagandrst with a message which
he is getting across." The subject or
hrs lecture at Iowa City was “The
Greatest Evil of the stern c ' '
tion, Nationalism." HS purpose, so
said Proicssor Ryttll, was to try and
tell the Western people that all the
lrncr qualities of manhood had hcen
crushed out hy Nationa , n. Man has
hccomc a mere automaton under its
hunctul intlueoco, according to him.

MISS WEEK ’ ART EXHIBIT
BEL“ SHOWN IN LIBRARY

The exhibit by hirss L. Weeks ot
Gl'iuucll in the art room or the library,
represents some of the best work or
lowa artists. Miss \Vccks' paintings
have been shown in the east and they
are ranked high by present day art
critics.

The artist's best work, perhaps, is
in portraiture. Something more than
a mere likeness may hc tonnd in each
painting of this type.

The picture or llrs. Evans is, per-
haps, the best known of Miss Weeks'
portraits. Dl'. Steiner on seeing this
picture is reported to have remarked,
“This is really a significant work ot
ar- " 1t indeed compares iavorahly
with portraits which hang in some ol.’
