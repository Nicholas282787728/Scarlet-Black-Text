ALL-CDNFERENCE T131111
Opinions will always d1iier as to
who should he on an All-Conference
football team. ‘Thel'e never will be
an eleven picked which will be satis-
factory to all.

The choice ct All-Conference men
that has been made by a ieadmg Iowa
daily and which we are_p1~inting else-
where in this issue will probably be
objected to by many. It 1s, however,
about the most unprcjudiced choice
that could he made and coming irom
such a Coe and Cornell stronghold as
it does, it means iar more to have
such preferences given to Grinnell
men. There, it anywhere, an authority
would play to the sentiment at those
institutions.

HIGH COS S.

Complaint aiter complaint has been
scored this year against the high cost
oi running a newspaper-7mm 1n eveiy
section 111 the United States.

The Scarlet and Black has been
just as hard hit as any oi the other
papers, Tremenduos advances have
been made in the cost 0[ print paper,
oi labor, ot cuts and of nearly every
‘item which enters into our expense
column. These are th1ngs we could
not help, but have had to take them as
they have come along,

Consequently, we are holding a "pay
up" day next Monday when we wish
that every one or our ubscribcrs
would pay 11p their subscriptions. Two
dollars means much to us at pres
ent 1n settling our contract payments
1; table will be stationed in the 1,1-
hrary all day and some one 11111 be
there to receive your money. Dont
forget to pay 111)!

WHAT Till: HERALD St“,

The Gr hell Herald, in commenting
on the decision or the College Dramatic
Club and the Elks to give “Prunellh
agahr tor the bcueiit ct poor children
in Grinnell, has the iollowmg to say:

(1) The cooperation oi the college
studcnts. What a tine thing it is tor
the college studcnts to turn in and
work with the town people for the
joy and betterment ot the children.
These college students are more anx-
ious and willing to cooperate tor the
good. oi the town than is generally
.known; but too often thc ways and
means are not clear. Here is a den-
nite thing. Quickly, willingly, ireely
do they other all they have. Thanks;
and the “kids" will say "Thzluks”—in»
deed.

(2) Community Spirit
more the community spi t is ﬁnding
expression at Christmas. During
Christmas week the whole community
get together wrlhngly, harmoniously
7:111 with the common purpose oi
'making the whole city happier and
better. Last year we had a good
Christmas; this year we are going to
have ahettcr one because we are! We
congratulate and thank the college
students. That is the spirit. And
don’t iorgct your home town and the
home folks. And to the Elks—Go on!
Go on!

Largely ror this reason, but also be-
cause no college students will attend,
and especially since the purpose of
the project is so praiscworthy. the
Faculty have granted permission to
the Dramatic Club to repeat their play
