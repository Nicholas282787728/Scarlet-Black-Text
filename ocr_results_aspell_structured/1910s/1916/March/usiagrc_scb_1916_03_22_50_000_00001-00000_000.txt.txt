The incidents leading up to tile do
tion by Grihhell and Beloit were
plained in The Scarlet and Black last
Saturday Briefly, the cause or the
cancellation or the debates by Griunell
was the tact that Knot sent a repre-
sentative to the Grinne -Coe debate,
while Carleton was represented at the
Grinnellt‘ornell contest here on the
same night.

Debating authorities in Griunell were
greatly pleased at the stand uhioll Bc-

tion against scoutin llad Belolt re-
fused. to break relations with Carleton
and l\ ox, Grinnell would have i..
the alternative ot rci’using to debate in
the Quadrangular or meeting Knox and
Carleton under protest.
