Floressor Stoops gme a talk at Y.
15. meeting last Thur day night on
“The Relation of ilic Individual To So,
ciety As a \Vllolc." starting with Car--
lyle's statement, “We have no right to
exist," he showed a man's duty to so-
ciety.

We should link ourselves with a 50‘
cial system to become a strong indi-
vidual, he thought, “We are parts of
a large family and we ought: to be
planning a family,” said the speaker.

Professor Stoops emphasized the
{act that seeking happiness for its own
sake could not make one happy. “To
get the best out of life." he said, “we
should lime a life richly adjusted to
the old institutions and traditions.’
Thus the prime object of college is to
discor-ci ouisclics, he thought.

In conclusion, he iilgcd that Grin»
hell‘ nicn awaken to their social due
ties. He feared that Roosevelt's state
ment, "We are losing our moral rigor
—we are in danger or losing our-
souls," was coining to be true. Unless
the United States arc to become like
the European countiies, according to
the speaker, a new iewpoint oi the
world should he taken.
