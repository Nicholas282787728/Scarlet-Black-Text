Saturday morning, when practices
have been scheduled as lollow
Freshmen at 3:15, Seniors and Juniors

Clocli‘.

Basketball is to mean a great deal
more this year than it ever has her
lore, according to Miss Andersen
Practices must be attended iaithfully
to earn it place on the team. No
games will he played until alter
Christmas, but those this year arc to
be impoltanl ones and amount to more
than those of last year.

Captain have been chosen for the
different class teams: Virginia. Klein-
me [or the Seniors, Francis Hershey
for the Juniors, and Marjory Frillk for
(he Sophomores. The Freshman caps
Lain will be selected inter.

Last year the interclass series was
won by ’19. Since no class has won
the cup given by Mr. H. W. Somers
for winning the College championship
three Successive years, this Sophs have
a good chalice to take the trophy.
