. VISION IN TEACHING.

Forty-eight members, over fifty
per cent of the Seniors, have deﬁ-
nitely decided to accept positions
as teachers in preparatory schools
during the coming year, accord-
ing to an investigation carried on
by the Scarlet and Black during
the past two weeks. This is an
amazingly large proportion, and a
tendency so general in a college
graduating class furnishes abund
ant material for serious thought,

Very few college graduates who
become teachers in preparatory
schools enter upon their new clu-
ties with an adequate conception
of the responsibility devolving
upon them. For a large majority,
their choice is only a temporary
one, and is intended to afford an
opportunity to prepare for other
work. Upon these especially
would he urge a consideration of
the real signiﬁcance of the work
they are about to undertake, tem-
porary though it may be.

Few of those who advocate the
“honor system” for college work
realize that the necessity for such
a system might be entirely obvi-
ated if preparatory school teach-
ers could he given a conception of
their work as embracing more than
the mere development of the intelr
lect.

Most of the "cribbing” of which
college students are guilty is done
without a realization of the true
sign cance of thcir action. They
consian' ”“c‘r a iv to cheat
without being caught as entirely
commendable, and in the majority
of cos _, it is doubtful if the ethir
cal issue arises at all. At any rate,
it is not uppermost,

Such a condition can only be
met in the early trai ng of the
studcrl, The moral issue involved
in such practices should be thresh-
ed out with the pupil before hi"

life prirciples are formed. and'

then the evil tendency will not
crop out when it is too late to
offset it
‘ en V'I‘ID become teachers
upon grade ion are given charge
of athletic; in their school. Here
they have the opportunity to deal
most effectually with another
problem confronting the college
of today—the problem of securing
honesty and sportsmanship in ath-
letics.
The college man who possesses

tells him to “use his ﬁsts when the
referee isn’t looking," If all high
school athletics were taught such
principles, the cracked coach
would be working on the streets,
for a living, ‘

'Ihese are only suggeﬁions in,
tended to indicate the vast ﬁeld of
opportunity open to the teacher in
like preparatory school. In such
work, most of all, there is need
