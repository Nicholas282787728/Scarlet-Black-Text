Griunell Spirit is often unjust in his
criticism.

At any rate tlrerc is a dilterchcc of
opinion and the only way for the two
groups to understand each other is
through the willingness ou the part of
both to take the trouble to really
know and undcrsland the other.

We are a college tarnrly . rrving for
a better ironic. Let’s get acquainted
and see it that doesn’t give us a boost
in the right direction.

G
CRITICISM.

Here as in many other places there
omlcili's i0 he an idea on the part of
some that criticism is blaspliernous
and not to be tolerated.

Constructive criticism is the basis of
irogress.

T so who object to criticism see
oui- the destructive side.

There are many in Griuncll who all
dcrrtly hold everything connected with
it as perfect and impossible of im-
provement. With this conception ct
Gl-innrll anyone who criticises anve
thing about the college is merely des-
troying that which is good.

Those who stop to consider know
that Grinncll is no more per-tect than

“Self government tor the stridentl

of Men ll. w. tilatlack in an inter-view
printed in the last issue at the Scarlet

statement the publicly cxprcsscd sen—
