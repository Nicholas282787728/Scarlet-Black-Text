lilimur Says That English Dephrtluellli
will Esmbllsh Clil'as III Use of

Persistent rumors which have been
circulating during the last rew days
seem to indicate that. a new division is
to be added to the English department.
According to the rcpnrt, all students
who are doing ineiiicicnt work in eith»
er written or oral English in any de-
partment ot the College will be re-
quired to take a course in the struc-
ture of English in addition to their
regular studies, and without credit.
Present. conditions indicate a large
clilss. At the time of going to press.
no details of the plan could he Ieai'nr
ed.

Such a system as is being contem-
plated is in use in many of the larger
institutions of this country. notably
Harvard, and is proving of great bene-
iit to the students both belore and af»
ter graduation. it is gratifying to note
that the plan is receiving attention in
Grinnell, it is stated, and it is hoped
that its acceptance will be a matter of
but a few days.

NOTICE.

training requirements should sign up
for winter activities by November 30.

De Pauw has just elected its third
football captain of the season. The
former squad leader had to be r -
tired on account or injuries which will
prevent their ever again taking part
ill the game.

Ennthall men at the University or
southern Calitornia enjoy an opportu-
nity that they believe to be unique.
Every afternoon after practice the en»
tire squad reports for a dip in the
