The Freshman ela , representing
seventeen states and onc foreign coun—
try, that entered Grinnell this fall, is
the largest in the history of the instlr
tutioii. The official enrollment totals
321, 43 of tirese being unclassified stu—
dents. The men slightly outnumber
the women. Out of a class of 278,
there are 141 men. or the 43 uhclassi-
fled students, there are 27 men. Most
of these expect to graduate with the
Freshman class.

ity Girls Refused Admission.

Owing to the largest enrollment of
women in the history of Grinnell, eye
ery room in the Quadrangle was occue
pied before the close of the registrar
lion week, As a result, entrance ap-
plications were refused to over fifty
because of this scarcity of rooina. The
increased number of men presented
)0 such difficulty, because of the fact
that all men room in private homes.

Unusual Ability Shown.

Among the Freshmen, there are
many men of exceptional ability, both
in athletic and literary lines. Several
high school football, basketball, ten—
nis and track stars are registered
among this year’s Freshmen. In the
realm of football, such high school
players as Mal'kley, Whitmer and Mar
Murray are numbered among Crin-
nell's large yearling squad. Brierly
and Slusher have won honors in va-
i-ious state tennis tournaments. In
high school basketball, Ziegler, Car-
ner, Hammond, Rolnig and De Ruyter
are not unknown quantities, In the
ﬁeld of debating and oratory, this
year's Freshman class has quite an
aggregation of high school stars. In
debating, such men as Smith, Fuller,
Breed. BrieI'ly and Tobin have won
honors in the various high school (167
rating contests over the state, while
in oratory Whitney and McCarthy have
each carried off honors in their dis-
trict. ‘

the largest yearling football squad of
any time in her history. In the inter—

Freshmen placed more men in the

BROWNSVILLE, Te. Nov. ls. 1916,
~To the Editor: I received iour lat
ter today and I was sure glad to hear
froni you, A letter or an s. is B. from
Grinnell is as acceptable here as a
canteen of eool water on a twentyrmile
hike.

The follows are out on a fifteenrday
hike now or "Red” licLareii would tell
you all about the “doings“ down her-.c
A few or us fellows were left in
camp and owing to that your letter-
was 'considerably delayed as it was
forwarded to the army's present posi-
tion some twenty miles north of this
city. We get plenty of these hikes
and will for some time. Forty thou—
sand troops are engaged in the present
“war” game, and the Iowa troops are
gaining all the advantages. The army
from Brownsville is called the “Brawn
Army," while the other twenty thou-
sand troops from San Antonio cum—
posc the "White Army.” The "Brown
Army” is supposed to be an invading
force from the Gulf, and the "Whites"
are to repulse them. Similar games
are played down here occasionally, but
seldom on such a huge scale.

Our camp life is pleasant enough
while in quarters and our tents are
large and eomtortahle. The papers up
north have acquainted you with all

such particulars though, I suppose, but
don’t let them convince you that all
we are doing is grubbiug cactus, for
it isn't, If the United States is ever
forced to take up arms against some

Work has been for the troops. When
we arrived here we were a pitiful
sight to say the least but now the
regulars admit our worth.

I are unable to master the Spanish
language. I intended to take Spanish
my junior year, but have changed my
mind, though it is a soft and beautiful
language. The Mexicans go and come
across the river as they wish. A few
of. theni are educated, but the majority
are of the poorer class and bear the
characteristics which northern people
believe them to have. They make good
football players, being small and wiry
and hard to tackle. “Red” has been in
several gridiron mixes down here and
Anson tSnialleyr, too, plays some. but
it is too early for football Regiment
teams are to organize Thanksgiving,
and later a brigade team.

I think we will be home before long,
although no one is sure. I'm sure of
one thing and that is that I wish to get
back and the rest of the fellows feel
likewise. We envy every man that
has the pleasure to make Grinnell

happier We will be,

This fall’s football season has been
splendid, including the Iowa gamer
You know that Iowa game was one of

couldn't have won that game, for Iowa
held the horseshoe,

We are glad to hear- of the large
Freshman class. That must have been
some class scrap.

BY the way, have the Men’s Glee
Club and "bums” had a go yet this
yearl I'm going to bring some cactus
home and introduce a new initiation
for Freshmen next fun. It's harmless
but invigorating and alter once mak-
ing it bed of it, a man can always keep
his feet under him. Coach McAlmun
would do well to havc 2t row of cactus
plants for the fellows to practice dodg-
ing around; I guess that is Why the
Mexicans are such good open field
runners.

Well, Wait, I must stop, for tattoo
has blown and this must be mailed.
“Red," Smallcy and I an send our best
wrslies,‘ and may Grinncll be at the top
in all.

Hoping to hear from you soon, sine
cerely yours. Donald Parker.

 

 

 

 

 

The excellent record made by Grin-
nell iu iootball this year is due in no
small measure to the scrappy Fresh,
men squad which has offered stiff op-
position to the varsity throughout the
season. The year-ling team is compos-
cd of real fighters, and their recent
game with the vurstty proved that the
class of 1920 contains some players of

When Criniiell and Cornell lined up
tor their annual gridiron battle last
Friday, it was the seventeenth time
that these old rivals harc met on the
football ficid. Their fi st game was
played in 1900, Grnnlcll winning by a
s to 0 score.

During thesc s teen years Gririnoll
has triumphed‘ in ten games, while
Cornell has been the victor in me.
There was one tie score of 5 to 5 in
1904. Although the scarlet and black
have a double advantage in the nnm<
ber of games won, Cornell has the
honor of piling up the largest score.
This was in 1910 when Cornell defeat-
ed Gl'inne'll by a 25 to 0 score.

Grinncll llus Most Points.

Some interesting “dope" may be
gained by a study of the past scores.
In the sixteen games played, Grinnell
has scored a total or 119 points, while
Cornell has totaled mm. In spite of
the fact that the former have won
twice the number of games, her small
advantage in points scored is due to
the fact that whenever Cornell was
victorious, she usually ran up a larger
score and at the same time "white-
washed" Grinnell. In five of the con-
tests the scarlet and black eleven fail.
ed to score, while in four Cornell fail-
ed to make any points. Beginning with
the opening of football relations with
Cornell in 1900, Grinnell won nine sue-
cessive victories, and not until 1909
did the Methodists succeed in breaking
the hoo»dou by a e to 0 score. For
four more years the Cornell eleven
held the scarlet and black machine
scoreless. But in 1914 Crinnell broke
this successive string of victories by
the famous 1-1 to ll walloping.

Cornell Won ill 1912.

Among the most famous games from
a Cornell standpoint were those of
1912 and 1913, In 1912 Grinnell had
succeeded in breaking Drakes win-
ning streak of four years' standing
with a 13 to 0 score only to lose the
Conference title to tire nearby college
by a 10 to o defeat, In the 1913 game,
Cornell was outplayed, hilt was lucky
enough to score a safety and win 2

Ciiii‘t Flu-get 1915 Giulio.

Probably two of the most famous
games [loin a Crinnell standpoint,
ucrc tllo. of 1914 and 1915. The al-
in t disastrous season of 1914 ended
in a brilliant comeback for the local
College. when all "done" was upset
and a superior Cornell team was beau
en ll to 0. Tire 1915 game can never
be forgotten by those who witnessed
it. McAlulon’s warrior-s emerged vic-
torious by a score of 13 to 6, thus
gaining the undisputed claim to the
Conference title.
