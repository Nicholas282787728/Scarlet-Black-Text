“RAMONA is a dramatization of Helen Hunt Jackson's famous story
by the same name. It is a great panorama of true to life touches that reach
the hearts of all. Th: picturing of the lives of Ramona and Allisandro
brings out the little known Indians' side of the settling of California by
by the whites, as well as giving an understanding of the Mission life of
those days. It rivals the “Mission Play."
