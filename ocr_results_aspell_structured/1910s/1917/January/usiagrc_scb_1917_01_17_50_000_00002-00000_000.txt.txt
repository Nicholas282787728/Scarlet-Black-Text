put to rest ith the announcement that

oi continence and of progressrior
that reason it was thought best to‘
make the emblem’ represent Grinnell

We don’t think it is necessary that

A few people must be reminded that,
the Gl'lnnell spirit does not show it-
selt in cheering when iouls are called,
at a basketball game Nor when any
player plays rough. These are <lis-‘
couriesics which Grinncll has tiicd to

 

avoid.

Why not? Because a crowd of the
best sportsmen cheer tor two reasons,
to show their appreciation and for on»

‘p ass in the Grinncll ncgi

courageincnt. Applaudlng fouls does
just the opposite and helps to develop
the poorer and “outlaw" side at the
game. It's discourteous, too. So don't
cheer when at ioul is called.

The Work 0! the band at the game
last night deserves high praise. It
was a vast improvement over the play-
ing at the previous game. Grinnell
appreciates efforts like that.
