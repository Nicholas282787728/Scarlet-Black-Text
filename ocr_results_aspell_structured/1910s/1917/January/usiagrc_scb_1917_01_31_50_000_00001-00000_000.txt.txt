The Grinncll basketball five lost
their first game of the season last Sat-
urday night at Iowa City, when the
state University team took a hard hat—
tle by a 19716 score. This leaves Iowa
as the only team iii the state which
has been undefeated by a state rive.

As was expected, the game was
largely a guarding contest, and while
honors here were about even, Iowa
was lucky on long baskets and this,
coupled with more foul throws, was
enough to cop the long and of the
score. Iowa made one more basket
and one more free throw than did
Gi-innell. In the entire first half but
three field goals \vei'e.tlil'owll, Iowa

the end of the hall, 8.5.

goals, hei'tl olson scoreless, and stop—
ped Berriell with one counter in the

scoreless.

Next Saturday rirgirt Gr hell will

here which may have a bearing on the
