A oiovcmcnt for a permanent mer
moi-ral for William U. McAllnon, prob-
ably in the shape of a bronze tablet, is
being initiated jointly by the Honor
“G" Club and The Scarlet and Black.
At the meeting of the club on Monday
evening it was voted to have a com-
mittee appointed to carry out plans
for raising funds for the work. Lewis
Earrott, Lester Watt, and Lcmucl
Wiics were appointed to take charge.

It is the intention to make the loc-
morial the rcsrilt or a whole-college
movement and not merely that of a
single organization. Everyone will be
given an opportunity to contribute a
small sum, either by handing it lo one
or the committee or by mailing it to
The Scarlet and Black.

It is expected tha tit will he an easy

already sent a one-dollar bill to Thc

example.

taken by the “M” Club of Minnesota

Grout Gallic lgainst Iicp-
~lcr of Cornell.

in a game marred by many personal
fouls, and slowed up by more held
balls, Griullcll trinimcd Cornell last
night in a rough and tumble contest
by a 15—7 count. »

The scar-lot and black team was ul.l<
doubtcdly the better, and had they
played the cntirc game as they did by
streaks, the scorc would have been
much larger. Each team played a
close guarding game, and the orer—
an. icty to hold down the number of
field goals was responsible for an un-
usual numbor oi personal fouls.

‘ “.lrlggic" Scraps Kepler.

The fans were inter-cstcd mainly in
the scrap bctwccn kcpler and Angus-
tilic at the pilot position. The former
had landed twelve ringers m a pre-
vious game with Highland Park, and
erci-yonc was watching to see how
"inure" would hold him, From the
score shoot it would seem that Kepler
had the goods on the local man, but
such is hardly the case. He got two
baskets, it is true, hilt he never moved
out of Grinuclls hall of the flour, and
both shots were from a distance. while
Augustine was all over the court, and
his floor work was simply immense.
He showed up especially well in “feed-
ing" the hall to his team mates.
Su‘nu Lends ill Scoring.

Kepler's two baskets were the only
field goals Cornell landed, as they
were blanketed by the Criunell guards
every minute. Their long’ shots were
wild for the most par . For Crinncll,
Swan led in the scoring with two bas-,
kels and three iouls. Worth also cop-
pcd two goals. Nor tossed one-
corrntcr, but his star work was in
guarding, as he broke up countless
dribblcs and passes. llcncham, as us-
ual, played a fighting game, and got
array with some pretty dribbling and
one basket.
