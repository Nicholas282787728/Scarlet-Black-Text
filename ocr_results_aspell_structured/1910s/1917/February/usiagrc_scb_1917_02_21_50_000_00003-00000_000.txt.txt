As soon as the wcather became cold

cement heated to mix concrete. Dul'r

by usiug boiling water with which to
mix the concrete. As the weather bc-
canic colder, boiling watcr was not
sulricicnt and a tire was built in an
'rlltl bollel' around which the sand was
heaped. This proved satisfactory, but

tendeut, w. 13. dchi-egor, and he in-
vented the present system by which
the exhaust troni the engine on the
imlxture runs through a coil cl pipe
buried in the sand pile. The rcsult is
a nice warm pile or sand, which, were
it not for the cold wind, some of the
