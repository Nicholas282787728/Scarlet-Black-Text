Sensational shots and close guards
ing were the features of the senior-
freshman clash in the class basket-
ball,sel'ies last Thursday afternoont
the upperclassmen coming out on top
by an 18-11 score. This game leaves
the seniors in the running for the
championship, as they have not yet
lost a game. _ .

The seniors presented their regular
lineup, Augustine and Watt making
their appearance at center and guard.
The ’1S»el's took the yearlings com
pletely ott their feet in the ﬁrst bait.
and registered 13 points without al-
lowing their opponents m score. The
team—work was all that could be de-
sired, and they displayed a much
greater ability to locate the basket
than was evident in their game with
the juniors.

Freshmen Best in Second

The second half was all in favor of
the freshmen. They came back with
a lot of ﬁght, and got loose for some
pretty baskets, most of them coming
as the result of close playing of the
ball. Vinsel led the attack, and was
ably assisted by Crane and Macy. The
Seniors were somewhat weakened in
this round by several substitutions.

Somers and Watt were the stars of
the senior machine The former got
loose lor three neat ringers, and did
great work in breaking up freshman
plays. Watt got one basket, but his
big work was in throwing fouls. His
record for the game was perfect,
as he made all four of his tries
good. Vinscl and Crane starred on
the freshman offensive, and Macy's

. delensive work was good.

scrves honor-able mention for his era
fective sneaking. Considerable credit
is due naﬁety for the way in which
he argued the main issues of the con-
test in the dual negative rehuttnl.
The others spoke in a very creditable
manner.

There was a clash oi arguments
thruout the debate. Institute cone
tcnded that there is a need for price
controlling, and that it is both work-
able and beneﬁcial as a permanent
policy. As opposed to this, Forum
argued that there is no need for price
controlling, because the conditions
which now exist Will not exist after
the war, and furthermore it is im.
practicable and unsound in principle.

But Annual Tour During Spring
Recess Is Planned

Owing to the inability of the Men’s
Glee club to secure good concert
dates, no trip will be taken during
the Christmas vacation. A number
of small towns were secured, but
rather than face the possibility of in-
curringaﬁnanoial loss, it was thought
best to cancel the entire trip.

Christmas trips in the past have
never been as successful as the
spring tour, so the business mane
users are outlining a schedule of
twenty days, to be followed at that
time, to include the time of both
trips. II: is possible that the tour
at that time will be taken thl'u
