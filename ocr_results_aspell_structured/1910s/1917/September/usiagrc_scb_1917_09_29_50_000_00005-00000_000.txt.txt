Building One Has
Want" Comedy But
Without The HEI'D

Building one or the men's dornis
was. to a liniite dexltznt. the setting
[or one of the standard comedy
ﬁlms where the hero (or heroine)
floats out oi his apartments in a
bath tub. The water was decidedly
present but the heio failed to put
in an appearance. .

All that is- ltnown is that shortly
before supper tithe Thursday night
inmate. or the building discovered
water oozing from under the bath
room door and upon investigation
i'onnd that in some unknown way
a lavatory had been broken loose
from its moorings and water pours
ing trom two broken pipe. Before
the flow could be stopped the water
stood several inches deep in the
part of the cloistei- direcaly adjoin-
lug.

If the villain who perpetrated this
dastardly deed is so badly in need
of a bath as tilis action would in—
dicate. the men of the building
extend a cordial invitation to him
to come around most any tinle and
they are willing to fix him up.
