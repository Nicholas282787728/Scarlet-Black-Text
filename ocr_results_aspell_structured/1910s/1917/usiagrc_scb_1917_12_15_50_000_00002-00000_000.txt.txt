PROFESSOR STEINER
That Dr. Steiner is absolutely loyal
is the ﬁrm conviction of Grinnell stu-

dents and iaculty members.
' We who know Dr. Steiner as our

fliend and teacher ﬁnd it hard to lie-
lieve that anyone could question his

' women of the class become charter

devotion to Amer 1ca7the countiythati

means SD much to him He came to
America because he believed in the
things that this country stands tor.
and the things that this country is
ﬁghting for now. He has devoted his
whole lile to the spread or American
ideals oi democracy and liberty, both
\here and in Europe. He has worked
with the immigrants: has helped them
to see the principles upon which this
nation is based.

That this sentiment prevails gen-
erally over Iowa. as well as here in
Grinneil, is sbown‘hy the iollowlng
editorial comment iound in two rep-

resentative paper

The Cedar Rapids Gazette. edited
by the lather oi Verne Marshall.
whose services as ambulance driver
at Dead Man's hill, near Verdun, have
brought him considerable praise, says:

“No one should seek to mar the
fame nor to impede the work of Dr.
4. A. Steiner uf Grinnell. ach, whose
heart beats only for democracy. It
would be well if there were more
such men—ii we bred more at them
at home instead of narrow-minded
politicians, whose sense or self puts
the greatness of the nation in shadow
to their eyes Dr. Steiner is one of
those rare apostlcs of whom the cause
or freedom has too few."

The Des Molncs Register has the
tcllowing comment to make:

“The Register does not know of
any man of foreign birth who has
dcne more to popularize the Amcl'i»
can ideal in Europe and among the
foreign born immigrants here at home
than Dr. Steiner. He came to Ainere
ica hilnscll because it was America.
and he has helped thousands or oth-
ers to come to America because it
was America. No man ll , done more
to make it easy for the immigrant to
ﬂml himself and to undoi- and his
cnv1ronlnvut.

“A testimony to the distinguished
service D. Steiner has rcndciod in
this way. a testimony that ought to
silence every voice of Cllti '5m in
Iowa. is the call the American Llr

A striking nrguiiient lor the study
or aciniun in .imcrican colleges and
iiiiircisities was given in ILII editorial
iii Tlic independent tor Dcccinhcr 5,
under thc licadlllg, "Alliel‘ica Dcitf

The editorial poiiilcd out that our
diplomatic mi sions had been liiiie
dared in all their woik because the
secretaries and attaches were not in-
iniliar with thc language 01' the
coiintrir to which they werc accred-
ited.

We should become familiar with the
language of our allies, and we slioiilil
also luiow the language or our cuc-
lilies.

1913.

When the seniors of today were
freshmen, Grinnell was so different
in many respects ironi what it is at
present that it is hardly recogniza—
ble as the same institution.

The treslinian oi the class or '13
made his “dates" with freshman
girls who lived in the ”Shack,” but
today the mention oi the “Shack”
means nothing to an undcrclassman.
He ate his meals at a ulixed board
has clubiuuless he classed himself
as a "rouglpncclﬁ" today any sus-
gestion ol mixed tables is considered
as an advocacy or a great social
revolution.

the change trom the crowded class
rooms oi “Chi“ to the ivarin, light
and ventilated rooms of the new
building.

Now, the senior man has the op-
portnnity to live in the most com»
:pletely equipped and best furnished \
men's dormitory in America.

But not in buildings alone has the
'lseer watched Grlnnell's advance.
The entrance at the freshmen into
track the spring of 1915 started the
upward journey of Gi-lnnell athlet-
ics, which has culminated in a root»
ball victory over the state Univer-
sity and a season without a. detect.

But thru all this outward growth
the Class oi '13 has held to the true
Grinnell spi it.

It remains the hope or all who
can ieel that spirit that the new
Gl‘lnnell may continue its advance.
but that the things which made the
old Grinnell a worthy contrlhntion
will continue to be its foundation.
