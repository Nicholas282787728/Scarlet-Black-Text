Tire value ot Licul, Geiger-s work
in Gl'lullell was well demonstrated at
the eenrpetit' c mllilaly drill held on
Word nold yesterday otter-noon, Al-
thorrgh he has been here but a few
weeks, he has so trained the men that
they made a very eredrtahlo showing
which indicated a grasp or some ol
the fundamental principles or military
work.

Little wa- done in the way or actual
training hctorc LIeuL. Geiger arrived,
because ot the inconvenient trrrres the
drill had to he held under the arrange»
incnt with the Ulll\ul'sil.y or town men.

Lieut. Geigcr'has endeavored to in»
terest all Griunell men in military
training, and even went so tar as to
organize a new company or men who
had not had the opportunity ot taking
the work when it ﬁtsl licgan this
spring. Now this conipauy oi men
can hardly he told from the others.

The introduction ot a military train
ing day, with a competitive drill and
appropriate ceremonies, and the
awarding ot the color-s to the winning
company are customs which will do
much toward making military work a
success here next year and in the years
following. The weekly lectur-os deal-
ing with military science and army
lite and customs hove neon especially
valuable to the men who are expect-
ing to get into regular army work
within the next lcw months.

Grim-loll appreciates Limit, Geiger-s
work, and thairks him tor it. llc has
shown hiurseil to he not only a callable

THE EDITOR‘S RECOMI’ENSE.

Broken in health because or con-
tinued over—work, V, w. Srtbin retired
from the editorship at the Ossco Re—
view last week, In his valedictory he
says: "I lliive made a few [Hands and

 

a devil ot a lot at enemies." That is
one thing that every newspaper man
can say. The conservative editor is‘
condemned because he is conserve-i
live, and the radical is damned be~l
cause he stirs things up. it the pcnsl
cilrpllshcr is impartial lie is branded,
as o “fellcerstl‘addlerf' it he takes:
sides he is narrow and higoted. Hi
there 15 an error that is displensing,£
all the king's ho- es and all the klllg'Si
men cannot con ince the disgruntled
one that the mi, take was not intenr
tional. it one man is praised his come
petitor is ottcnded. ll some duo’s name
is in the paper one week arid not the‘
next the someone will he “peeved"
because it was in the first week and
outraged because it was omitted the
second. Every reader expects the ad-
itor to know all ahout the scandals oii
twenty years ago, all or the intricate
ianrily connections, all or the tamily,
skeletons. And in addition the editor,
always has to contend with a total ig-‘
norancc ainoug his readers of the me—
chanical part or rrs work, the lules
and aims that guide trim. But. the tow
tricnds. the occasional good \l'ol'ds,‘
