Military training in Grinnell College
will be a thing of the near future if
Lhe decision of a mass meeting held
last Monday night is realized. At that
time two hundred men of the college
met and at the close of a long session
a petition asking the faculty to install
some form of training in Grinnell was
signed by 125 students.

Appluml Motion.

A motion put by Lloyd Taylor, an
instructor in mathematics and physics,
was passed with land appTause. It Was
to the effect that a telegram be sent
to Senators Cummins and Kenyon, in-
forming them that the men of Grillhell,
in a mass meeting to consider mili
tary training in the college, declared
their patriotism and loyalty.

Favor Compulsory Kind.

Near the end of the meeting a rising
vote was taken to find out whether
student opinion favored compulsory or
voluntary participation in military
training. A majority of the men pres»
ent arose in favor of the compulsory
kind. A committee was then appoint-
ed by Fred Kﬁltenhack, chairman of
the meeting, to work out a plan which
would be practical. Bernard Carney,
George McAlmon, Richard Budlong,
Eli Osgood, Louis Parker and Frank
Markley were placed on this commit—
tee. In a short session after the ad,
juurnmeut u! the mass meeting these
siy men concurred in the opinion that
any system which would be establish-
ed would have to be compulsory. The
plan which seemed to be thc most in
favor made it compulsory for Fresh
men and Sophomores and elective
with upper classmon.

More Is Opposed.

Speechcs pro and con were given by
prominent men during the evening.
Those who spoke from the platform
were Bernard Carney, Prof. C. E.
Payne and Maurice Fridlund. These
talks were followed by a lively open
discussion in which tcn or twelve men
took part. Opposition was voiced by
501 Gilberg in this part of the proc
gram. Prof. J. F. Ryan was one of
those who spoke in favor of military
training.

Tells oi Encampment.

Bernard Carney told of how much
had been accomplished in thc short
time spent by the men in the Plattss
burg encampment last summer where
he himself went through the five
Weeks’ training furnished there. He
reminded his hearers that drilling was
no fun and that they must go in to
stick if at all.

Maurice Fridlund brought out the
immense need for military preparedr
ness in the country and stated that if
America were to stick to her policy of
voluntary service in the army it could
only be made possible if there were
enough mcn trained for officersianrl
the college men are the logical ma—
terial for these, he stated.

The College Baud furnished music
before the meeting.

Among the girls who entertained
their mothers over the week-end are
Mary Gladys Thompson, '19. Dorothy

Mchrliindalc, '20, Gladys Fletcher,

In a game in which the result wast
ever in doubt Grinnell lost to Ames
in basketball by a score of 25 to 20
last Saturday night. The Score was
tied again and again during the con—
test and but a few minutes before the
end of the game it stood 16 to in:
Then the Ames crowd began to make?
their shots good and kept the lead un-il
til the end of the contest. Paige made
two baskets in the last two minutes. L

The first period ended with the score,
9 to a after a fray marked by the Ag-
gies' inability to cagc their shots. In
the second period they had apparently
recovered and most of their tries lo-
cated the ring. Grinucll showed good;
marksmanship throughout thc game,
though very few of their shots were}
long ones but were rather earned after‘
the ball had been advanced by good
team work.

Smut mugs night

Swan made good from the foul line
eight times out of nine and threw two
ringers from the field, so that his
share of the Gl'illnell score was curls

.dcrablc. Paige was also successful
from the white line, cagiug five out of
six trics. He led in individual points
with a total or fifteen, The five field
goals which were chalked up to his
credit surprised Grilmell fans as he
was guarded by Captain Swan. They‘
are accounted for by the fact that the,
Grinnell leader played all over and,
that the Ames forward succeeded on a‘
few lucky long ones.

Augustine played a good game, play-
ing all over the floor, while Erskine,
who held down the ring position tori
the Cyclones, hung down under tbc'

This method of attack led to a switch

DAN DANDE DNLY AT THESE

’l‘crpsicllorists Not Allowed To Attend
Auy Duuccs Din-lug College Session
aﬁeld First llig Affair
on March 22.

Direct super , on of vacation danc»
es has been assumed by the College as
a result of action tab... by the faculty
at a special meeting last Monday when
provisions were made for the holding
of six vacation dances a year on the
campus.

The six college dances are scheduled
to take place, one each on the night ‘
before college opens,‘ on Thanksgiving
cve, ou the first night of Christmas
vacation, between semcsters. on the
f 'st night of spring vacation, and one
during commencement. A student
committee in cooperation with‘ the
Dean of Women, will have charge of
the plans. Attendance will be limited
to students, faculty and guests of the
college,

Bun 0n Term Dances.

No sharp change is involved in the
new policy since no dances will be al-
lowcd during term time. It is under-
stood that any dancing off the campus
will be strictly prohibited.

The new policy results largely from
dissatisfaction felt in connection with
former vacation dances that have been
held in the down town district. The

,strictly non—comllleréial character of
dances under college control will pro-

vide saner and more wholesome con-
ditious, it is believed.
Hits Precedent.

The action of the faculty colues as
a climax to a large amount of discus-
sion and agn'tatiou concerning the danc-
ing question as a whole, It seemi
certain that the removal of vacation
dances to the campus will be welcom-
ed by Students as an addition to their
social life. Oh the other hand, the
firm stand of the faculty in regard to
no termdanciug settles that question
definitely. '

A college dance on the campus is

’not without precedent, since last June

a commencementuance was held in
the Rand gymnasium.
