Perhaps the most dimcult program
given by El. V' (30 studullt was pres
sciitcd hy Glut s Downing ,.i pupil oi
Mr. Errgstmiii, in her l'eoititl recs
day evening.

Miss Downing has a. promising lyric
soprano vaicc which was at its nest
in the heavy program .4. certain
artistic ﬁnish and n distinct contlh
made the recital particularly interest-
mg.

The program opened with "0, Had I
Juliars Lyi-c," by Handel, in which
Miss Downing showed a splendid techs
nique. It was followed b~ the melo—
diolls “Were My Song \iith Wings
Prevrded," by Hahn, delightful in its
pisiiissiiiic edcct.

One or the most ﬁnished numbers
was Mozart's "Non so piu ccsa soil,”
where the singer's good tone color and
style ‘wcrc especially vis'bi. The
plaintiv "The Dew is Spaihli by

was sympathetically inter»

The two songs by Liza Lehman were
most artistically done. “Lullaby” was
sung caressingly and ill clear tones,
while "Snake Charmer" was brilliant
and in coloratura style i

“Mignon,” by d‘Hordelot, and "Orr
pheus and Hi Lute,” liy llanney, twe
charming lyrics, contrasted with the
romantic “Life and Death" by Coler-
ige-Taylor, and “Birthday/J by \Vhitv
ing. In both types Miss Downing
showed her ability to vary her mood
as the selection demanded.

:lIiss Downing was most sympathetis
cally accompanied by Mrs. Dotter-
Weich.

A delightful song recital wits given
by winiIi-cd Alluy, Monday evening, in
which she was ass 'led by Mrs. Dots
terweich. accompanist.

Miss Almy's clear enunciution and
splendid Voice control made her pro-
gram especially pleasing. In all her-
songs Miss Almy's range was most
noticeable, combining the hill and
round upper tones with the clear
lower ones. .

In the ﬁrst group, ”The Alpine
Rose," by Parker, was the must ape
pcaling. The two lyrics, “It was a
Lover and his Lass" and “Spring,"

- is given a sympathetic interpreta-
tie

“Long Ago, Sweetheart Mine," by
MaeDuwell, was sustained and had an
even color throughout. “What the
Chimney sang," by Griswold, and “The
Victor," by Kenn, were full of dram-
atic power.

In the last group, "Slave song," by
clel Riego, as well as the rest of \l’ s
Almy’s program, showed a well dcvvle
oped technique. The climax of "Love,
I Have Won You." by Ronald, was
especially well done.

. ss Almy is the pupil at Mr. Eug-
strain.

Dr. and MisE. A. Sterner are expect-
ed home this evening after their res
cent stay in New York city.

EVENING 8 :15

THE STAR: A mere slip of a loss, a Wholesome, sprightly, charming Wood violet. How else can one typify Anita Stewart? Radiating the spirit of joy and mat;-
uralness, imbuing all her portrayals with that subtle quality of “soul."iAnita Stewart’s characterization of “The Girl Philippa,” reaches the highest
point of her dramatic achievements. She has beautyislre has charmishe has magnetism. She is dainty in manner, poised in action and finished in
performance. Her wide range and control of delicate emotions, her ability to register her feelings and thoughts so as to convey them to the and-
ience, her rare grace of body and her finely chiseled features not only make her the ideal Philippa, but America’s most popular heroine.

THE PLAY: “The Girl Philippa,” from the pen of America’s greatest novelist, is zt tale of two hearts told in terms of love, war, beauty and adventure, aglow
with color and romance, alive with movement and action, set in an atmosphere charged with secret agents society intrigue and blood lust—the magic
spell of the author‘s genius has woven a splendidly delightful love theme that charms and pleases. “The Girl Philippa” is as fragrant as the wild
rose. Its tempo is like the speed fire of a machine gun. The story plays the music of the heart.
