First. Invasion of Foreign Ter-

Saturday

FGWERFUL ﬂu? DEVELOPED

Iowa Aerial Squadron Is Feared
Since the Skirmish With
Nebraska:

Following the successful capture of
the second line of the ciiem 's
trenches last Saturday, Captain Au-
gustine ’ rcasscmhliug his forces for
his or 'e on the third line trenches
at iowa City next Saturday. This
is the ﬁrst time that the Grinneli
army has invaded foreign territory
this year, and they ille looking for»
ward to a tough battle.

In case Griunell wins the contest
next Saturd ', a big step will be
taken toward the capture of the
enemy’s capital, State Championship
In the 1916 campaign, the Iowa forces
succeeded in repulsing the scarlet
warriors, with the result that Grin-
ncll lost her rating as a ﬁrst rank
power. The defeat came only after
a most strenuous effort on the part
of the Iowa veterans.

New Chief of» Slnli

'However, conditions have been
changed in the iocal camp. A new
chief of staff has been secured from
our powerful ally, llinncsota U,, and
he has the advantage of having a
veteran army with which to work, It
is evident from the ﬁrst two battles
that he has developed a powerful al-
tack, which will cause much trouble
to,lhe Iowa defense next Saturday.

In defensive tacti s the Grinncll
battalions have also shown to ad
vantage, easily i-epulsing the two in-
vasions which cucniv scouts have
made on scarlet territoiy.

it is believed that thc lowa aerial
squadron will bear watching in the
coming contest, In a ﬁercc skirn so
with Ithe Nebraska heavy artille
last Saturday, lowa made her best
gains by the aerial route, and it
seems that this part of the Hawkeyc
attack is yet well developed,

Capt. Augu inn Is “Ace”

In past battle honcrcr, Captain
Augustine has proven himself to he
an "ace" in this particular branch
of tiic sorricc, repeatedly breni ng
up formidable i-ai , by enemy fu‘m»

that he will lose his cunning before

The vote, while comparatively light,

was heavier than it has been for the
two preceding years. the 244 ballots
contrasting decidedly with the total

Hard Game Is Ahead

1 IOWA FIELD, IOWA CITY, 1a.,
Oct. l”——Still out of condition front
the severe battering received in the

9' game with the University of Nehras»

ball squad entered the ﬁnal stages
of practice in preparation for the
contest with Grinncll college on Town
Field three days hence. The Hawk
eyes have scrutinized the record of
the scarlet and black so tar this
season and are fully aware that a
hard game ! ahead of them.

Despite the severe drubbing handed
the Gold by the powerful Cornhuslicr
aggregation. Iowa's lino performed
the best at any time this season. and
it is not e‘qlectcd'that any material
changes will be made in order to
stop the Grinncll backs. 0n the left
side of the line, Coach Howard Jones
is particularly ivell satisﬁed. At e d,
the veteran Ree aliho weigh
but 155 pounds, is credited by many
to be one of the best defensive men
in the west. hblr supporting him
in the tack 9 position is Jewell, who
is not an "I" man, but saw some
- ity experience last year. Kelly,

. eleven, is
beyond a doubt a ﬁxture at guard,
Lillif IS l’l'ublolll

The right side of the liiic has been
a perpetual problem to the Iowa
coaches, and although it is not our

colleges and universities plan to

A total of $35,000,000 must be se-
cured throughout the United Santos

The fundamental plan of the cam-
pillgn‘ is to furnish "Y" men for the
American soldiers in France, and was
originated at the request of General
Pershing, commanding the United
states forces on the European
front, Kei-ensky, the Russian pre'r
mier, has also expressed a desire
that the Y. M. c. A. of the United
States adopt such a plan in order to
"put the morale in the Russian line
and save the day through its morale—
saving force.”
