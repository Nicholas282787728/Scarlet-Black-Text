THE SUNDAY TEADITIO

some change on the Sunday tradi-
tion seems desirable and necessary
after the student referendum the other

No.12

day. While the vote of the men and.
'Omeu's‘

the girls not living in tbe
quadrangle should not be decisive, the
fact remains that a majority of the
quadrangle girls voted against the
present tradition.

Undoubtedly many of the students
who voted “No" on the general ques»
tion of Sunday dates desire a modifi-
crttitur in the present Sunday tradition,
even tho they are against any radical
change. On the other and, probably
a majority of those voting “ch" de~
sue a modiﬁed Sunday rule rather
than a complete overthrow of the Slin-
‘day tradition.

W at changes should he made in the
Sunday traditioni

Two modiﬁcations have been the
subject of general student interest this
last week, and deserve serious coils
sideintion. >

Perhaps the more popular one is to
have dates permitted Sunday morning
and afternoon. and until 8 or 3:30 in
the evening. This would make it pos—
sible for the men and women to go to
church and vespers together. and
would permit dinner parties at the
Quadrangle and men's dining r om.
The great majority of Grinnell Sll‘
oi-s are here for Sunday. and while an
output-town visitor now makes a sun-
day date legal. there seems to be no
reason for denying Sunday dinner palu
ties to other students when guests are

not present. .
With this plan. the evening would

still be free for the development of
community life. both at the women's
Quadrangle and the men’s. dormlr
tories.

The other modiﬁcation frequently
suggested is to permit Sunday evening
dates from G to 10 or 10:30. Dates
woulddint be permitted the rest of the
day except for special reasons. as they
are now.

Either of these plans would he an
improvement over the present Sunday
tradition. Either would preserve the
desirable distinctive features of a

Grinnell Sunday.

nize football; I said. in my opinion,
there should be no intercollegiate
football in America this year.

With the editor of the Scarlet and
Black. I agree that football is a better-
preparation for iiiilitar service than
collegiate military training, and tho
doubting the correctness of the Staten
incnt that football training cut a big
figure in securing admission to the
training/camps, I feel fully convinced
that football practice has played a

‘Vel‘y important part in the securing of
l commissions.

In my talk I said. “Are
we loyal to the real men who have
proffered to their collntiy their all.
when we act as tho a football victory
was the only thing on our mental
horizon?" This was the point of the
whole talk—the one thing that seems
to have been overlooked—H, W.
Norris.

IN CAMP: The fact that Grinnell
has a good football team in no way
brands the school as one housing
slaeke To me that is a very absurd
idea. Nor should athletics or an , kind
brand it as such. This particular
period demands courage. manhood.
and a sound body. Athletics will pro-
duce that result.

Has it ever occurred to you folks
that no ﬁtting substitute has been of»
tered to entirely take the place of all)»
letics? Of course, Military Drill will
be the answer——but that alone is not
adequate. First, it does not offer the
right kind of mental relaxation. Sec
ond. it becomes mechanical after a
short time and makes a machine out
of a man. Third, the fellows in school
will get plenty of that to fill in spar-e
moments when college days are over.

Body building is one of the big needs
of the country and a necessity for one
going into military service. Why not
get that in college. and by approved
methods of the past? The host men in
camp‘ her-c are those who have had lots
of athletic experience. It is no dis»

tennis. Far better toi- him to be tend-

The Real Issue

In behalf of the strident council, 1
wish to protest against the umust
criticism voiced in the communication
in last Wednesday's issue. We wish iti
310 be understood that the student

‘tlie students, and believe it our duty
its support the opinion of the rnaioiitv
iil‘l‘espectlve of our own personal idea
We deny any unfairness iii the vote
taken. and also the accusation of haste.
Th'- matter of sunday dates has been
agitated for years and everyone had a
more or ‘less deﬁnite opinion on the
matter.

The real issue is no longer one can-
‘Cernlrtg dates~it is now whether
ldemocrtlcy and majority rule are the
controlling factors of social life in
Grinnell.

As we have said beiore. the matter

of Sunday dates should be a settled
~i.tl‘i:.tir as far as the students are con-
cerned. since they have so decidedly
isllown‘their preference on the matte
tBut the matter is only an incident of
the real issue. it simply happened to
be the thing which came up at th
time to test out the big vital matter
that is, the place that student opinion
occupi s in the social life of Grinnell.

If this matter fails. then democracy
not only has failed. but majority rule
has been shown to have no place in
Grinnell life, Also it would clearly
demonstrate that the student council
is truly what it has often been called.
a mere tigurehead.

lf Grlnnell has been distinctive and
unique in this matter of the power of
the majority in her social life, let its
