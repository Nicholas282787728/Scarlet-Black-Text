FRESIDENT MAlii
‘ DISGUSSES DATES

“It Is a Question for the Women
of Grinnell to Decide,”
He Says

"I am not talking against dates, hut
against snap judgments." This and
several other shots against what he
apparently considers false conecp
tions composed the big shells that
President J. H. '1‘. Main ﬁred into the
'eanni or those who believe that the
vote taken last week should he ﬁnal
in deciding the Sunday date question.

A point on which President Main
placed emphasis was the diherentation
between old and new students. "Arc
ﬁve weeks in college enough to give a
student such acquaintance with the
standards or the college to entitle him
to the same consideration in a vote
as the older students?" he said.

Must Have liiinrmt-d Majority.

Tlieprcsident stated that he was
willing to accept the opinion or the
major of the students as expressed
hy a vote. but it must he an informed
major .

’ “It a question," he continued, “tor
the women of Gl'mnell to decide with-
out any coaching ti om the men. Also
it seems reasonable that the women
of thc,uinier classes should have the
dominating inﬂuence in a decision of
this kin:

In regard to illc‘gal dates, he said
that it was not a question or legal
Sunday dates versus "Cooper school
yard dates," as illegal dates would
continue even it the Sunday tradition
were aholished. "It is a question or
whether or not the tew who have such
dates should dominate thc opinion and
custom or the institution."

MEN AT ALLENTIJWN PLEASED
WITH IDWA GAME, SAYS PREHM

Ernest Prelim, iii a recent letter, ex-
presses the happiness of the Grinncll
boys at Allentown over the.result or
the Iowa game. The extract tollows:

“When we heard that Grinnell beat
Iowa we were about as happy as any
one could he, although we had seemed
to know instinctively that the game
was ours—oven hetore it was played.
Mike Augustine has a worthy hunch
ot toothall men, and they will merit
the state championship if they get it—
and I really believe .they will.”
