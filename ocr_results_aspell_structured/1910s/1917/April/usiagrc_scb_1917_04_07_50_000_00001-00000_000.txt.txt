For Pow Freshmen,

In new or the fact that the demand
ior rooms in the new men's quadran-
gle has thus iai- greatly exceeded the
accommodations that are being prcpttr»
ed, the college administraiiou has vot-
ed to build two additional units of the
group immediately with the c‘ eeta-
tion that they will be ready to occu—
pation in the fall. The decision to
build was made at a meeting of the
college trustees and the directors oi
the foundation last Saturday.

Sixty more men will be accommos
dated in the twoadditionnl buildings
that will be constructed. This will en.
able the college to house appro. mate.
ly two hundred men in the new , oup
oi buildings. Tlicse accommodations
are hardly expected to take care oi
the demand.

Contract To Bailey-harsh Co.

The contract for the new buildings
has gone to the Bailey-Marsh Company
of Minneapolis, which has done prac-
tically all of thc Gl'inncll building
work for several years. Constriictio
is to commence immediately and evel
effort will he. made to have the build
ings ready for occupancy when col-
lege opens no. September. The col-
lege foundation will issue bonds to
iinance’ the enterprise as it did with
the other men's buildings and with the
women's quadrangle,

An opportunity will be given for
men who have secured rooms in the
four units of the quadrangle now be-
ing built to move into either of the
additional buildings in case they so
desire. It is probable that a majority
of the additional accommodations cre-
ated will be taken by incoming fresh-
men.

_ The two new buildings will be built
north of the ones being constructed at
present. The fifth of the group will
front on Park Street. running, on a line
with buildings two, three and four,
The sixth unit will he the northern-
most of the present group and will run
east and west parallel with the first
building which fronts toward Profes»

"\Iy country, I heal you calling me,"

the first week of vacation. '1 6 two
men, who entered school at the begin-
ning of the second scmeste- aiter a

was called out Monday, March 28, they
were forced to bring the Gl‘iurlell life
to an abrupt end and join their comr
pany at Cedar Rapids.

Wertz was still in Grinncll when the
call came, but lelt that day for Cedar

KELMAN DELIVERS
GREAT WAR LECTURE

Pastor of Elliululrg Cllln'cll Gives Viv-
id Description of Life ill Trenches
in Frilllcknﬂlcs Will's But
Tllilllis This One Neces-
sary For Peace.

Dr. John Kelmau, pastor of St.
George's Presbyterian church, Edinr
burg, Scotland, gave one of the most
interesting lectures heard in Grinnell
this year, when he discussed “Life in
the English Trenches.”

He told or his experiences at the
front, how it felt to be under fire, and
the moral and physical effects of the
war on the British soldiers.

“War 15 Price For Peace." .

“I hate war," Dr. Kclluall declared;
"it is the hell of hells. I am now a
peace at any price man, but the price
we must pay for peace is this war,
which we must win to secure peace
for our children and iiiturc gellerar
tions,"

The lecture was informal, and utter

(Tents and townspeople crowded dl'nlllld

America’s entering the war, and to
look at his official photographs taken
at the front.

Alli-ice To America.

“If I have any ad cc to America,"
Dr. Kelman said, “it is to caution tier
against underestimating the strength
of an enemy. preparation for war has
meant to England not only the making
and' collecting of munitions but the
mobilizing of the man power, the W07
man power. the money poiver. the food
supply, and the application at cfliciellr
cy to all our industires. The war is
costing England 535.0%,000 per day
and thousands oi lives. The help we

menace and financial credit."

Dr. Kclman is well known as an
author. He wrote “The Faith of Rn-
bcrt Louis Stevenson" and other able
works.

"Next station~G unell—bl.“

Those words sounded "pow’iul" good
to the Glee Club men this afternoon
as the 12:50 Rock Island rolled into
the station, completing the spring tour
of the club through southwestern Ior
iva. incidentally, the trip was one of
the most successful in the history oi
the organization, from the viewpoint
of pleasure as well as finance. One
of the men, rather heavy set, and a
well known center on the or -on, had
just been cautioned by every indivi ,
ual member not to forget his overcoat,
a habit which seemed to fasten itself
upon him at every station. and which
-had once cost him a date.

Dinner At: Boone Feature of Trip.

One or the features of the trip was
the s. o'clock dinner at the home of
Royal Duckwortli, '19, in Boone, on
the evening or the club’s appearance
lin that city. Several old ”grads" who
‘lvel‘c present assisted in rendering a
'pl'cllmillilry concert at the close of the
l(ltllilel'. A similar feature was the any
{nual banquet of the Council Bluffs and
Omaha alumni, held in the former ciiy,
at which the club were guests A t
through the Thomas D, Murphy face
tories at Red Oak, the home or the
'lul‘gest exclusive calendar industry in
the world, was personally conducted
by Archer Payne, '09, a former mem-
her.

and overloaded iv o baggage, signalled
the engineer to stop, while "Froggy,"
thinking himself 'iultle to arrest and
imprisonment, speedily reti-aced his
steps toward the station. The l t
seen of the train, it was slowly gain-
iug speed around the curve.

The tour, entirely in southwestern
Iowa, was made through one of the

'ehest sections oi the middle west,
and took the club through some oi the
finest cities and towns or the state
Tlic people were everywhere very hose

A system oi niililai- training will
be begun immediately in G ’iincll as
the result or a faculty vote taken
Thursday afternoon A increment for
some system of training was initiated
by the men of the college at a mass-
ineeting heldsevcral weeks ago. A
second Inassdneeﬁng will be held next
Monday evening at which the faculty
plan will be presented and discussed.

According to present plans as an,
nounced by Dr. Spi-ague this morning,
Waldo Nor s, president of the student
Council, Wt preside at the meeting as
the representative of the student body,
while George McAlmon will speak as
representative of the student commit-
tee on Military Training, of which he
is chairman. Dr. Sprague, represent?
ing the faculty committee, will c
plain the details of the plan and give
any information that is desired. As
the system will be voluntary, the prob-
lem of enrollment probably will be
taken up zit this assembly.

Cnp . mllmzt will Help.

Captain Mumnla, u! the State uni—
versity, who was in Griuncll Thurs—
day looking over the ground, has ob
fercd to come to Grinuell once a week
and supervise the training, and to give
a course in the theoretical side of
warfare on the same day. He will
bring two assistants with him so that
thorough training can be given the
members of the Gi-innell corps. Cap—
tain Munima went to Des Moines yes—
tertlay to ask the Adjutant General for
the services of two officers to take
charge of the work during the week.

It is too late to secure the equin—
inent from the government before the
close oi school, but much of the nec-
essary drilling can be given without
it, and the course in the theory of war-
fare can be given just as well, so it
will not be as much of a handicap as
one might think.
.uimy Will Go To Camp.

To any strident contemplating going
to one of the government training
camps next slunmor, this additional
training cannot help but be of great-
est valiie. There is a movement to
enroll a large number of the men of
tlie seni - class to take the training
ofiered in one of these camps, probe
ably the one at Ft. Snelling, Minne—
sota. which is the nearest.

I . necessaiy to have only one hung
dred men to carry out the plan of mile
itary training. and it is expected that
an enrollment of two hundred will re-
sult from the adoption of the system.
One hundred twenty five ineu signed
the petition which was pre. nted to
the faculty alter the massmoeti g held
a while ago, and from the way the
war spirit has grown throughout the
oouniy, as the actuality oi war is
brought home, two hundred is not too
large a number to expect.

Membership in the corps does not
car _‘ any oblif'atiml nor Sllbjt‘ct the
member to col by the government.
The main purpose is to give elementary
training and make a man physically
fit to enter one of the training camps
or enlist.
