would prove superior from a ﬁnancial

need for a change.

King was easily the star of the con—

itest, and his oriliiaut work in the
closing rehuttal went a log way to—

EBetz, for Chi-esto, proved an unusually
5clear and rorceiul speaker. Herriott

proved equally strong debaters for

The purpose of the summer camps
is to train 10,0011 omecrs or take
charge or the ilrst hall million troops.
The men who make the most sati
lactory records at the camps will r
ceive the ﬁrst appointment as oil
cers, in August or September, and
most of the others will be put in the
reserve corps‘ for use when the second
halr million men are called to the

most or the colleges over the coun—

try are giving diplomas to seniors
who are admitted to the camp next
month, provided their work has linen
satisiactoiy so tar during the year.
Credit is heing given undorclassmen
who leave college for the same reason.
While no omeial action has been taken
here, it is probable that the Grinnell
men who enlist will he treated in the
same way.
The expense of the summer camp
is being borne by the government, al.
