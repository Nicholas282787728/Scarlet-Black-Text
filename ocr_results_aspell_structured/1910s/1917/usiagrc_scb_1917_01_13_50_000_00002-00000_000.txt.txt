Probably it there is any subject
.which needs to he brought to tiie at-
tention oi Grinnell students it is ith
regard to the hidieions expenditure or
their own money, or semester rec ap-
propriations.

Recently, in despair, lliztlly people»

have urged The Scarlet and Black to
utter a protest against the way in which
the y: l. c. A, Lecture Course was

~ being run, and especially against the
return engagement of .Alired Noyes for
next Saturday night. A large propor
tion of students are seeing their 567
mester rec money, much oi it earned
only through strictest economy and
hard labor, expended tor a man whom
_ they have already heard, with whose
personality they have become ac—
-quainted and who has absolutely no
attraction lei- them. It is an absolute
waste of their money, they thinlt, And
it is.

What is the purpose or the Lecture
Course, anyway-v it is to bring stir
dents into touch with some of the
greatest personalities of the day. in
the case oi Alfred Noyes, who was
here last year, we already have made
our study ot his personality as tar as
one can go at any lecture. Collier
quently, why rcpcat the study, paying
student money to do i
is unfortunate and loohsh.

she wants it good one. Not. ing but u

it was interesting to watch Coach

game last Wednesday. At first he
termed it is “practice game," but he

excited as any man on the sidelines.
Some of his phrases were: “Come on,
Nels, get some pep;" “Collins, use
your noodle:” “Collins, get your mam"
“Who's that man (Worth) 7'“ “What
