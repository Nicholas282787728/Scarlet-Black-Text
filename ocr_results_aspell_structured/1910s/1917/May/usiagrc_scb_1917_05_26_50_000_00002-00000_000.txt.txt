TO THE OLD BOARD

in commencing our duties or edit:
ing and managing The Scarlet and
Black for the coruing year, we al‘e_
glad to have an opportunity to express ‘
our appreciation to the old managed
ment tor their work during the past
few months. Their record has beenl,
an admirable one. They have inade‘
the Scarlet and Black a larger and ai
newsier paper. They have increasedi
its circle of inﬂuence, particularly
throughout the world outside or col—.
lege.

But even more signiﬁcant than the
physical changes, has been the de-
velopment of a greater spirit or car
operation among the members ot the
stat. Organization has been the Revs
note from the first. iollowed by 1.th
strengthening ot the loyalty ot the
suit members. Few starts have work»
an together with such unity of pur-
pose, few have become so permeated
with the idea or friendliness and link

tual aid.

The holding at a statt house par-t
and conference at coliax, followed by
dinner parties and picnics, the ini-
tiative taken in starting the organiza-
tion ot the iowe college Press asses
ciation, and the securing or a number
or prominent newspaper men to ad-
dress the staff during the year have
resulted in unitying and strengthening1
the start to a remarkable degree. And
the result to the college has been al'
better newspaper.

it is tor these things in particular,
that we thank the old management.
They have pointcd out paths which we
hope to follow torther. Their inﬂu-
ence will last more than one genera
tion or stat: memebers.

it is with genuine regret that we
have to say goodbye to the graduating ‘
board members, Their friendship as‘
well as their help has meant rnuch‘
this year, and can not help but be an
inspiration for the future:

NEXT YEAR

The Scarlet and Black has but one,
airnathat is to he a newspaper. The
more nearly we can make our college
paper contornr to the rules and ideals
of the great newspaper world outside,
the more satisﬁed we will be. The
time has ceased, it it ever existed,
when a college paper should be a
mere academic sheet, a ”review”, or a
literary pamphlet.

A5 Harvey ingharn has emphasized‘
so many times in his talks betore us
the past year, the ﬁrst duty or a neWSr
paper is to tornish news. And news
is everything that interests the circle
01 readers.

We believe in a newspaper with al
"unch," a backbone. Convictions and
feal'lessness or expression are as
necessary (or a. college newspaper as
they are tor a metropolitan journal.
We believe it is better to have a wrong
idea now and them, and to make an
occasional mistake, than to have no
ideas at all.

Editorially we are making a slight

optimistically, we will make our plans
enthusiastically, and we will carry
them out to the best or our ability.

OUR HIGH 5 “00L GYES"S.

Today Grinnell is again the host to
many high schools or the state. we
hope that our guests will bccome ac-
quainted with the college, not only
with the buildings, but with the stud-
cnts, and to as great an extent as pos—
sible iu the short stay. will feel the
spirit which makes Grinnoll dittcrent,
—R. C. B.

THE VALLEY ME

The entering or . men in tho Ml5v
souri Valley conference meet at Alnes
today is a sign that once again is
Grrnnell holding her own with the
largest and most prominent univei»
srtics in this section of the country.

The simple tact that college of {our
successfully con-
tinue in athletic competition over a
w c period of years with institutions
haying four to eight times that Illllnr
her of men is a mark of distinction
tor the college.

The track season did not end with
the conference or state meet tlr
Grinnell's ”place in the sun” is further
being determined today. and the ath-
letic achievements of the year will not
be complete until Julie 9, as at least
two wearers of the maltese cross will
strive for honors in the Western Cone

.fcronce meet. ‘

REGISTER TODAY.

College men of military age should
note carefully the article appearing
on another page of today's issue in
regard to registration under the come
pulsory service law. The opportunity
of registering by mail is one that

lshonld be taken advantage of imme-

diately.

The onlcial registration day, June
5, comes in the midst of examination
week, when tcw students will be able
to return to thei homes. No one
cares to run the risk of getting the
registration card in later than the
appointed day. The result might he
serious.

Prof. Gannaway has been uﬁcia‘tly

,appointed to handle the registration oi

all Grinnell men away from their
home towns, He has the necessary
cards, and can give instructions in re-
gard to the details of the law.

See him today.

A COLOR BATTALIO

In every school or college where
military training is well established,
the competitive drill is one oi the tear
tnres oi the year. Companies drill
constantly for mouths,‘ in order to
have the honor of being the crack
squad or color battalion.

Grinnell is just starting work in
military training. but owing to the
foresight of the men in charge, we are
to start the custom of competitive
drill next Friday.

A regulation army ﬂag will be given

,the company that makes the best ap-

pearance in the afternoon's work.

Every Grinncll man and women now
has a chance to "do his bit" to en-
courage the worlr in military tr ing.
First, he can lend his support by at—
tending thc exercises next Friday
atternoon. Second, ire can contribute
his mite toward buying the honor dog.

The college has relused otters from
individuals who were willing to pay
the ten or iitteen dollars the dag
would cost, preferring that a group
of alumni, or a large number of the
college body would contribute a little
for the fund.

The Scarlet and Black will be glad
to receive contributions from any of
its readers. A limit 01 twenty—ﬁve
cents per person is being made in
order to give everyone a chance to
get behind the project. Donations can
be put in an envelope marked "ﬂag
fund” and dropped in the business
