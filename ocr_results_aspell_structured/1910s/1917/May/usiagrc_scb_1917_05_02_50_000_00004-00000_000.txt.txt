The recital of compositions by

Lorna Angeline Palmer, '17, Tuesday

as a revelation to music

' Palmer showed her abllr

nut her own fancies in

the instrumental numbers without

varying from the technical term.

while adapting the moods to at the

various poeiiis, the accompaniments
brought out her originality.

The Sonota, written in the usual
form was played by Miss Palmer. The
ﬁrst movement lillegro ma non troppo.
disclosing the theme, was followed by
the song»lilie Andante, the most “,19'
lodious part or the Sonata. The Min-
uet was gracelul and had a dancerlllie
hainiony, while the Allegro Risoluw
brought the whole to a climax, sumr
niing up the other three movements.

The Song Cy le, “The seasons," was
sung by dladis Downing, who gave
to each the interpretation which it de-
served. The slumber Sons, "Little
Boaiic," suns charmingly by Miss
Downing with a delightiul Violin Obll»
gate played by Grace Scary, was one
of the most beautiful parts of the pro—
gram.

The three violin pieces iverc well
interpreted by Grace Scary. . Melody
in Irish Mood was a pleasing bit or
reeling, while Lamontatioii expressed
a deeper and more protound senti-
ment.

These numbers, like the rest or the
program, showed Miss Palmer‘s abil-
ity to vary in style and mood.

The last number, a string Quartet,
was played by Miss Scary, Mr. Gray,
Mr. Peck and Mr. Pierce. The nu—
dante Cantabile, as the name implies,
is a song-like movement. It was well
sustained and melodious throughout.
The iiinuetto, in regular lorm, gave
a prominent part to the ﬁrst Violin,
with contrast produced by Pizzicato
