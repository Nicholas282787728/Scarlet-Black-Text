Announcement of a Women’s Edi-
tion of the Scarlet and Black is to he
made. The number, largely devoted
to the interests of Grinnell, women,
will be published next Saturday.
start girls will do all of the repol
ing and editing. MiSs Agnes Car
son, who has been on the staff longer
than any other, will be the editor
or the issue.

__’_’_.

And now atter reading that Prof.
H. w. Norris gave a paper on "The
Eyeball and Associated structures in
the Blindworms," one student wants
to know how a hlindworm can have
eyeballs.

New mottos for college men have
been invented by the Daily Illin
“Plant a potato," “Pick and pickcl a
pickle," “Propogate a pumpkin," and
“Grow a grapefruit."

“AMEN/i 'S GREAJ‘EST FAULT."
Actuated by what they consider

their patriotic duty, over one hundred ,

Grinnell men are going to leave the
community within the next ten days.
some will join the army or go to
training camps, other will go to a
farm or some other line 01 helpful
labori

In making their decisions they

should consider America’s greatest
fiault#tl.\e crime of waste." it is

' waste of training if a man doesn’t
do what he is fitted for.

For instance. it a man has been
studying to be a doctor he should not
think for a moment of leaving his
studies. Thousands of doctors will
he demanded in the next two years
and he is one of those who will he
needed. For him to join the navy
would he a great mistake.

if a good farmer, who knows noth-
ing about military training should
join the army, he would he likewise
doing a great wrong to his counti-
The place (or him is on the farm.
Ant] if a well informed student or
military training who had norcr,boen
on a farm should go to the rural disc
triets, his mistake would be just as
great.

So when Grinnell men make their
decisions we hope they will he pati
otic to their country and remember
“America’s greatest faultithe crime
of waste."

"Shortage of food is one of thc serir
oils hitses of the world war. The
r c wheat held on larius lloicli 1.
1017, was 101,305,000 bushels. as
against 244,445,000 bushels the year
previous. on March 1, 1917, there
was in the country mill and elevators
iii the United states 01,000,000 hush-
els,o1 wheat, as against 133,000,000
bushels March 1. 1016.

“On March 1, 1917. the corn i'u»
scrvc held on tho (Mills ot thc United
states was 730410.000 bushels, as
against 1,110.550.000 bushels a year
'hrevious.

"Thc average condition of wheat
throughout the United Status April 1.
according to the latest government i ,
port, was 02 l per cent, as compared
to 73.3 per cent a year ago and 30.2
per cent lor the ten year average

“The United States in 1915 or ,

lduced 10 bushels of wheat per capita.
,lii 1015 it produced a bushels per
capita and consumed 0 173 bushels.
i “A serious crop failure oiving to
prolonged drought in Argentine, has
lelt that country with but little, it
any surplus, and an embargo has ler
ready been placed upon some ioorl
products.

“The United states potato crop in
1010 was 34,000,000 bushels less than
lin 1015 and lli,000,oon bushels less
‘tldivul in 1914. The carb- potato crop
in Texas has been injured by severe
‘fi'osts, which will curtail the produc
ition from that locality.

l “The production of wool in the

united states was approximately 205.-
000,000 pounds. The annual consump.
tion of wool in the United States is
approximately 000,000,000 pounds."

These ﬁgures more a threatened
