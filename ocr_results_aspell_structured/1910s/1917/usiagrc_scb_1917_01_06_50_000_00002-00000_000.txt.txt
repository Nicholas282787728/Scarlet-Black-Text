Willi a suddeniicss that caused Grill»
'riellians [0 almost gasp for breath,
came the news of the death of a man
who has to. two y-eais heeii dear to
the hearts of eveiy one iii Grinnell.

“Coach" 11chlinnir came here but
recently almost as a strangcr. His,
recommendations were so laudatory
that we would not believe. Yet in
me liricf space of two short seasons he
has convinced us that ho had disci»
plinc, friendship and ability to an ex-
tent that knows no end.

One of the most prominent charac-
teristics of "Mac,” as he was frequent-
ly called, was his shining personality
which won for him friends every-
where.‘ In fact, the name of McAlmon
can not be remembered without at-
taching to it this ever present charac-
ter.

They say that he has leit us. but he
hasn't. The spirit of optimism and
confidence that he has brought to
Grinneli is a thing which will live.
His contributions to the spirit of the
institution is without hounds. HIS
contribution to the spirit of his friends
is just as immeasurable. His is a
wonderful instance of one kind of fin-
mortality.

We are lost in sorrow for him, but
we cannot help but ieel better over the
fact that we paid our tribute to him
before the end came, thus to make him
the happier in the last days of his all
too short life.

Ul’ ONE MORE STEP.

Was the convention worth while?
This was about the first question that
was put to staff members when they
returned home from their two day ses
‘sion at Colfax last Monday and Tues»
day.

The meetings crystalizcd into a
greater determination for work and a
”better knowledge of how to give The
Scarlet and Black a higher standard.
The program or news work as well as
the series of speeches were among the
most valuable contributions that have
been made to Gl'illllell newspaper cir-
cles'mi' some lime.

Yes, the meetings were worth while,

and it. is hoped that more can he held ‘

in the near future.

The program of speeches was open-
ed. Monday afternoon With A short talk
by the Editor on “Organization and Its
Problems." “The Hotel Colfax" was
explained by Mr. Dickerson as the sec
and number, luxd Ed Hadley, of the
Des Moiues Evening Tribune followed
with an address on ”HOW To Tame a

"There is o. lot of routine shift that

have no doubt but that within a mile
of Colfax you could rind scores or iii-
stances of feature stories that would
bring hundreds of dollars.

Country 0r City?

When a member or the stafl asked
the qucstion, "Is it better to go into a“
country newspaper or a city newspav
lici. , Mr. Inghain replied; “If you
are looking for ,the big position, go
into a city daily From there you can.
work into a position of honor. Howe
eve , f you want to live a life of ease
and comfort, with plenty of money,
there is nothing that will pay as well

One of the staff ventured to ask con-
cerning the field for girls in newspa—
per work. "There is plenty of oppore
tunity,” stated Mr. inghani. “It she
has any literary talent in feature writ-
ing there is a very large field and a
big demand. I don't believe I would
recommend her going into a city like
Des Moines unless she wants to get.
into higher circles she had better not
do it."

Mills Gives Experiences.

Tuesday morning Professor Buck
gave a short talk to the staft on “An.
Dreciation.” Bert N. anus. advertis-
ing manager for the Bankers Life In-
surance Company of Des Muines, dee
li1-c1-ctl the final address on the pi J
grain Tuesday evening. He discussed
largely his own experiences 1vl1ilo city
cditcr of the Des uloincs Capital and
gave many suggestions for feature
stories. 1

One statement 111. Mills made was
that the biggest men are the best men.

clined to do favors, he stated. He told‘
of his 'llel'ience in interviewing Am:

nell a few years ago. A certain Grine

Editorial comment means libel suits."

“Pulling off a 'scoop’ is the biggest
thing in the newspaper world," saidi
Hadley, "out a. scoop hy underiiand
methods is the smallest thing. One
thing that a newspaper does insist on
is that a story be gotten by legitimate;

Ingliuin Outlines Field.

1111-, Ihghaln's address largely e
plained the nature and field of news—
paper work. “Many people think that
the important duty of a newspaper is
to express public opinion," he said.
"I would say to you that it is to fine
nish news. You will find only a few
men to dispute this, for it has become
the common opinion today

The field of newspaper work was
outlined by 111. ingham; “There are
iour distinct departments of a news—
paper today; as an exponent of opin-
ions, to publish news, advertising and
circulation. if you are thinking of go—
ing into newspaper work you must
choose one of these four fields. it is
necessary that you analyze the field;
early and long before you undertake to
go into any actual work."

“Be a Pressman," Advises.

"if you are wanting to make plenty
of money, then be a pressmnn,” .111.
lnghain advised. “The pressiiiaii the
highest paid man in our building. if
any of you have any mechanical in—
clination 1 would ad ’ you to look
‘into the possibilities of running a large
newspaper press."

“It is harder to write editorials than
t is to write news stories. An editor-
ial writer does not require as much
literary ability, but he does need
shrewd judgment and a wide knowlei
edge of affairs to enable him to Me
tpress an opinion on tiny subject. He
must have a knowledge of thc world."

“Feature writing, on the other hand,
requires less All round ability, but
more literary ability. it is the most
