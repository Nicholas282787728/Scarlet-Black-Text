THE SCARLET AND BLACK

YES. IT WAS A MUST TERRIBLE AOOIDENTI

But the “News Story" Reporter Gould Nut See the Remains of the

Russian Gaunt Alter t

Funnyﬁthe things some people do.

You see, it all happened this way:

You have heard of the kind of peo—
ple that become so inspired with their
work that they can't forget it, haven’t
.you'.’ Well, down at Colfax too many
speeches effected one of the visiting
reporters this way. Continually he saw
news stories, he "smelled them a block
off," he dreamed them, and it is said
that occasionally he ate them a ten
courses, once.

Now, just as 3. Billy Sunday sermon
intakes a man got up out. of bed to pray
in the middle of the night, so did these
inspiring speeches turn the reporter
into a midnight “Sherlock Holmes” or
“Detective Burns.”

A fast train \Vhirl‘ed past the hotel
at top speed. Its shrieking whistle
rent the still cold night and awakened
the reporter's room mate. And there,
at 4:th a. m., leaning halt out or the
window and gazing into a black, zeroA
like darkness, was the "news story"

“What's the matter?" drawled out
the YOOD] mate, sensing something un-
usual, /

again.

still no answer. The “news story"
reporter Came back to bad.

“What can be wrong?" the room
mate queried a. third time.

Then slowly, and half Sleepily as
he rubbed his eyes, the reporter ex—
plained: "I may have been dreaming

he asked

You see, a Russian count was just run
over by that train that went by. It‘ll
make a tine story: ’Russian Count
Killed By Train! HOW does that
sound?”

But he couldn't see the count’s re
mains from the hotel window that
cold, dark morning.
