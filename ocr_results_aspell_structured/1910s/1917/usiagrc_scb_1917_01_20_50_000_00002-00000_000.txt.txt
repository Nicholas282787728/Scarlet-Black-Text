That uhat we are inclined to place
the most emphasis upon may be of
very slight importance in lite is indi-
cated by the departure from Grinnell
ol iiike Augustine, the college’s greate
est all-around athlete. His father’s
sudden death put on his shoulders the
7 burden of supporting his mother and
the younger children of the tamily. and
ot operating the tarm ironi which
comes their sustenance.

Augustine has been much in tho‘

public eye tor several months. He was
the unanimous choice or critics for all~
state ioothsll honors. and was the
mainstay or the basketball team. The
Register not long ago ran a well 71»
lustrated story about his rise in ath=
letics. Yet here something happens
which aitects his lainily lite. and all at

The college athlete is of interest to
itho public only when he stirs them by
this dccds. what he does on the foot-
ball field or the track 7s at little imr
Iportahce in his own lite. He could get
‘the same physical development in the
gymnasium and demonstrate the same
superiority to opposition by driving a
hog to town. But the struggle on hold
Iol' track appeals to the imagination.
‘ztntl what is at slight importance to the
lparticipant focuses attention or thou—
sands o7 followers.

So if Mr. Augustine, iii addition to
the sorrow occasioned hy the tragedy
in his lamily. feels the ditticnlty ol
giving up work that was attracting at.
tention and applause, he may find con-
solation in considering that those who
applauded him wcre really only satis—
fying some oi their own desires. and
that their failure to take interest in his
tutui-e work is no reﬂectan upon the
importance oi that work.

stiupsonian: “Isn't it rcally queer
the way people sometimes change their
minds? For instance, it was only
about two weeks ago that a Grinnell
‘wrrteup in the Des riolues Register
istatcd that Grinnell was scheduled to
‘ lay a 'practice game’ with Simpson

'on February 12.
7ment was expressed that Simpson
might be able to come back enough to
make the game interesting, it could
only be regarded as a strong practice
contest tor the Grinncllians. But the
morning alter the antes-Simpson
game, Grinnell decided that their alum-
ni would he substituted for Simpson
in giving the varsity practice. And
just a day or two ag , another Griir
nell writeup stated that Simpson was
‘tlie only ‘big team' in the state that
Grinnell 77 as not to meet! We do not
know which school will turn out the
better teaiiiiwe believe they will both
be strong. But we feel that it is a
trifle egotistic for one school to spook
or a ‘1ir‘actlce game' with another in-
stitution that has every reason to be
able to at least otter lair competir
tion."

upon him at his father’s death. He
