The Cornellian: ”According to the
press announcement last the
faculty at Grinnell have decided that
changes Slmlla!‘ to those mettle at.
Cornell a year ago are a good thing,
and proceeded to adopt practically all
of them. The admission requirements
have been made to more directly con—
term with the work of the high schools
just as a year ago our own faculty
decided practically or accept the stud
ent from accredited high schools.

“Incidentally the same action was
taken in regard to the degrees. The
Bachelor of Science degree is abole
ished, major work offered in all scie
ences, but for the completion of all
courses only the degree of Bachelor
of Arts is given."
