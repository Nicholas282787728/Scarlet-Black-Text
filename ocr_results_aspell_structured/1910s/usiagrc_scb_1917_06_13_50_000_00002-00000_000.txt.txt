COLLEGE 0R MILITARY SERVICE?

The high school senior who 1' wavering in his
_‘ choice between college or milita . scl'1icc for 11
ryear will do 11 011 to consider the following pardr
graphs by Fr lt‘nt )Iain, of Glinllt‘ll:

“The great opportunity, and I could almost
say duty, of ore ' mall under 21 is to gut
IGEItli for a larg'cl ser1ice to his countri [,1 L1
or three y'eals from 11011. If n hm should e\ei‘
go to college. he should go this tall. so that
he will be able to prepare himself for s it":
to the nation.

HThe gorernlnent does not want these
younger men in the army and liar or tllc1'
would have been included in the selectli'c Lll'ait
law. The gorol‘nlllent wants the older and bet-
ter trained 111911 11011 and e' eats the others
to prepare thclllselyf e later.

“The men over 21 who are 1) ssed over ill
tllc first draft, or who are ph. 'ally unable
io entel military sortiee, halc tllt‘ same 0111101»
tnili _ i1 5 fall, and the) sllould return to col-
lege as usual.”

Giinnell offers ullusnal opportunities to the new
students nextycar who wish to prepare for national
scl‘rico. Extensive milita ' training. and a broad
and comprehensive Curri ululn iii-o interrstinn fru-
tures planned for the year. And the new lllell '
dormitories and the women's quadranale 1
insure a complete and enjoyable College ll

religion.

"Jesus belongs to Construction and
government, 11' spirit is the warp
and woof of c ation and of pros;
ress. His spirit is life. We have been
treating Jesus as a religious teacher.
He is more. His gospel is the inclur
sive standard of right. living. Truth
and right are the elements of la. ing
peace and World federation. They are
bound to succeed. at at. once, but in
the View of Christ centuries are but'a

ured by eternity. Liberate Christ's
gospel from the Conventional linlits;'.
from the little handbags in which you
are Carrying it about.

The Supreme Idealist.

“These principles must be realized
through us. Jesus is the supreme
idealist because he saw the truth ﬁrst.
He proclaimed the soul as priceless
and set the mark of eveilasting life
before all peoples and nations. He
wns the greatest idealist and he was
also the greatest worke His'is a
gospel of everyday work. Christ’s
gospel becomes his gospel only as it‘
becomes inearnated. Get. control of
the world. This is what the gospel is
for. ldunlists are prone to give up the
world rather than to conquer the
world. Christians are living in a wel—
ter of good will rather than reorgan-
izinv institutions and business life on
a fall' basis. It. is the business of the
Christian to be at the front in the
ﬁght for righteousness. The religion
of Jesus Christ must master politics,
business, international relations, the
instruments of production and of dis
tribution. It inust master the world
It must use the methods of intel_li-
gence and hard work inspired by the
spirit of the Christ. it must do this be-
cause Christianity is nothing more
than the expression of God in 11121.11 so
that ultinmtr. success is sure. The
gospel of Jesus must win because it
is human nature in its ultllnate reach.
but it must win through men. .

"Jesus cannot be reduced or reﬁned
to any department of life. He was
and is the universal umn. He is com-
ing out of the tomb today and will
shine with renewed power and glory.

Sneaking directly to the members
of the graduating class, President
Main said:

"This your of 1.117 is large in the
annals of the world, Jesus Christ, the
master of the ages, was never more
master than now. But no more will
