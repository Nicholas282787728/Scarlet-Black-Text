Hi; Allccrtl‘scd at Last.
There was a man in our town.
And he was wondrous wise;

.llc swore (it was his policy)

He would not advertise.

But one sad day he advertised.
And thereby hangs a tale.

The ad. was set in quite small type
Ami headed "Sheriff's Sale."

Rogers N. Stricltlano, n football star
on the ‘Wentworth Military Academy
team. also hears the honor at having
his picture printed in all the maga-
zines in the country when he was one
year old as the best. example of what
malted mill: could do.
