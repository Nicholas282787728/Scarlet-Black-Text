Tile playing of the Grinnell orches-
tra was a revelation to those who had

work which this organization has been
doing all year under the direction at

is not large but iL is flexible and the

is able to call Iorth would be a credit
to an ’Ol'ganization many times its

A BRILLIANT YEAR

NEEDI-IAM TAKES FIRST IN
FIN'AL SPEAKING
CONTEST.

PPIZES ARE TD DE INCREASED

Founders of the Contest Will Make
Additions of at Least
Fifty Per Cent in
the Future.

The ﬁnal speaking contest or the col-
lege year, the Hill Prize Contest for
Men, together with the Hill Sight Sing-
ing Contest was held in Herrick Chapel
Saturday morning at top. o-clspp,
Drins Needlmm, Jay Minkler and due
Carter took the three prizes ior speak-
ing wllile Paul Sprague and Paul Bart-
lett won the two prizes tor singing.

Tile contest was or an extremely high
order and made a ﬁtting climax oi the
years work in Public Speaking. The
ﬁnal test at a man’s ability to speak
is his ability in extemporaneons work
and the Hill Prize puts the emphasis
in the right place. The high order at
the speaking done is evidence at the
constructive value of the Hill Prizes.
Tile only thing to mar the occasion was
the ahscnoe oi tlle usual large crowd
which was kept away by the hard rain
that iell all morning.

One oi the ieatnres oi the contest
was a speech by the Reverend James
L. Hill, one oi the donors 01' the prizes.
Dr. Hill intimated that he was well
satisfietkwilh the contest ,ond in view
of the exceptionally high standard,
he has given out the statement that
the prizes will in the tutors he raised
at least ﬁfty per cent. lie wishes to
make tlle two contests two oi the hig-
gest things oi each Commencement

Tllc speech oi the prieewinner, Dring
Needham, was on "Tile Foolishness of
War." For his ﬁnal college contest.
Needham came across in his old “sil--
ver tongued orator" style, and easily
walked oii with ﬁrst place. it is well
that every one or the three prize win-
nors are Seniors, hllt it is also to be
regretted that these three men can com-
pete no more ior Giinnell.

Minlller. winning second, chose “The
Great Need oi the Church" lor his
topic. There is a steadiness and con
rectnass about Minkler‘s speaking that
wins him many a place. His prose-r
tatlon was very eliectire.
