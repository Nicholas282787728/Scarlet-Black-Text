Practically all the re sity men are
members of these three houses. The
manner in which they will line up will
present two tennis so erenly matched
that it would take a high powcrcd mic-

once. The supremacy or the two teams
will be fought out in a battlc in which
every contestant will display all the
football knowledge that he has over
learned.

The backfield for the Hoyt House
Supei-bas will be composed of Angus
tinc, Day, Schulz, and Markiey. The
opposing offense of the Bouquets will
be Barrett, Grant. E. Macy, and Watt.
There is no apparent advantage for
either team in their backs.

The Superba line will consist of
Martin and R. Hoyt at guards, "Dad"
Hoyt and “Father" Smith at tackles,
Fleming and Bohlman at ends, and
probably “Smoke” Brown at center,
Hall was originally slated tor the hey-
stone position, but he had an accident
which will prevent.

For the brilliant Bouquets, Mathcws
and Wires will be at guards, hichlmon
and Osgood at tacliles, Akcrman zturl
D. Macy will cavert at ends, and Get
teys will play center. again in the
line the difference of the two teams
approaches zero.

According to the latest reports from
the front at feh‘ necessary articles have
been added to the original compact for
the battle. The game will be played in
twelveqninute quarters with five min-
utes intermission between halves.

her three maiden aunts, Prim, Prudc,
and Pl'haci'. 1n the first sccncs she
is elf-lilic, full of questioning and ot
wonderment. Into this little retreat,
so far removed from the bustle of the
world, comes a troupe of mummies,
each emblematic at some spirit of fol-
ly of the age. Picrott, a person or
grace and authority, young, careless
mid gay, paints to her the world as it
really is, woos her with lurid song
and torrent poetry, and with the aid
of his associates carries her away. At
the close she has learned the sadness
of the world and is no longer innocent
or care.
