BUTTTRAGTURS FDR ITTTRMS
HAVING LABTTR TRUUBLES

Riot Clillscll “’lleu Bailey-H
'Sll Brought in a Gang of Mexi-
chlls From Dos Jluilms to

Break Local Strike.

(From Gi'mnell Herald.)

Grinncll had its ﬁrst taste of labor
trouble Monday morning. when an
altercation developed at the depot
over the bringing in of a gang of
fourteen Mexican laborers to work
on the new dormitories at the eols
loge. The men hlzd been hired by the
Bailey-Marsh company, which has the
contract for the buildings and which
has refused to recognize the laborers'
union. The men were accompanied
by A. R. Earl, one of the Bailey-Marsh
company's veteran foreman, who has
been on the job at VVootlwai‘t'l, where
the company has been erecting the
buildings for the state colony for
ehileptles. He had ﬁnished his work
at Woodward and the company in—
structed him to recruit a gang of
laborers in Des Moines and to bring
them to Gl‘innell to go on the job
here.

When the train arrived yesterday
morning 0. F, Bailey of the Bailey'-
Marsh company was also on’board. R.
D. Marsh of the company and Super--
intendent MaeGregor were down to
meet the train. So were the strikers.
who had heard that the Mexicans were
coming in and were down in force.
As Mr. Bailey and Mr. Earl with the
laborers alighted from the train, the
altercation developed immediately and
went so far that Mr. Bailey declares
that twice threats Were made against
his life. City Marshal Shaban ap-
peared on the scene and took M)‘. Earl
and Mr. Bailey with him to the city
ofﬁces. In the meantime the Mexi-
cans were escorted by the strikers to
the labor hall and ceased to be fac-
tors in the situation.

The situation today shows no
change. The Bailey-Marsh company
is still determined not to recognize
the union and the union is just as in—
sistent on being recognized. This is
the only difference, as the company is
paying higher Wages to the men who
are on the Job
