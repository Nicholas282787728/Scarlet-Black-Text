.t GRINNELL It. 0. T. C.
A Reserve otliccrs Train is Corps
has ﬁnally hecn granted Grinnell by
war department authorit

1t is a matter for the serious cone
sideratiou oi all Grinncll mcn.

hlnur or them have just completed
an s, at. T. c. caper- iice which, due
to iiiiiorcsccn conditions, left a poor
imp ss n of the military. it was an
experiment carried out under practi-
cally impossihle health conditions.
Naturally it could not succeed.

An unusual condition such as was
existent during the s. e. T, c. can
not blind thinking men to the great
cdrantages of military training at the
present time and under lavorahle cir—
cuinstaiices.

Thc R. o. T. c. will introduce mili—
tary trai ing under siich conditions.
it is not the s. A. T. c. and is in no
way connected with

The s. A. T. c. placed the emphasis
on the ini tary and made the academic
life subservient in every respect. 1t
was,the arniy ﬁrst. last and always,
and the rest or the time for ordinary
pursuits of college life.

it is the purpose of the government
that the R. o. T, 0. shall he introduced
into college without in anyway .dis<
turning the academic side. The mili-
tary work under this systcm will he
precisely comparable to any college
course or three hours except that little
in the way of preparation will he re-
quired. or course college credit will
not be given.

The R. o. T. 0. requires no barracks
life and entails military di ipline and
authority only during the time actur
ally devoted to iui tat-y work which
will amount to three hours each week.

Work in the R. o. T. c. will take
the place of the phy, al training now
required or all ireshman and sopho-
more men. It offers innumerable ad—
vantagcs over physical training with
no disadvantages unless an added hour
or class room work is counted as such.
chardicss ol une‘s personal views

on the suhject, universal milimry‘

training seems inevitable tor the very
near tuture. The R. o. T. c. is do
signed to lit college men, who are the
natural leaders oi the country in many
lines of endeavor, to lead in military
life. Those who complete the work
will take their places as oliicers
rather than enlisted men in whatever
m itary program is adopted.

For the trcshmnn entering college
in itary training is as vitally import
ant as are mathematics or English.
It is even more important in that it
bears a close relation to all at his
other activities. .

The average man enters college with
a lax, unorganized system of life, luill.
ta , training teaches him the princl»
pics of discipline and self control
which will make for succcss in what—

UNIFORM OBLIGATIONS.

In connection with the privilege oi

sired to call attcntion to the military
requirements such privilege carries
with it. For example, no soldier will
be permitted ever to wear part or his

Carpenters, machinists and stu-
dents are all alike in the sense that
they are all workmen. The carpenter
is an expert with the hammer and
saw, the machinist with his wrenches
and the student with his hooks. A
carpenter constructs a house irom
ilonr joists to raitcrs with lils hammer
and saw, the machinist puts together
an intricate mechanism with his
wrenches and the student weaves his
iahric of knowledge by means or his
hooks.

There is apparent ouc vcrr radical
dittercnce between the caipruter anti
the machinist and the student. The
carpenter has a chest complete in
every detail in which he keeps his
hammer and saw. Bctore putting
them away he assures himseli that
they are in proper condition. it they
are wet he dries and oils them; it his
saw needs sharpening he attends to it.
The machinist has his rock in which
he hangs his wrenches. Each is kept
in its proper place ready tor use.

How does the student care for his
books? Where he keeps them is an
unsolved mystery. Not a sign of a
hookcase is ever to he seen. They
are so rare in the rooms of the aver-
age college student ss to be classed
as a curiosity.

Ordinarily one or two hooks can be
found in the waste haskct, several
more can ordinarily he pulled out from
under the hcd.‘ The lew which are
absolutely necessary to academic work
are scaLtel'ed about the desk with, pro—
ken hindings and torn and mutilated
leaves.

student workmen build by hooks.
They deserve as much consideration
as do the saw and hammer or the car-
pcnter.
