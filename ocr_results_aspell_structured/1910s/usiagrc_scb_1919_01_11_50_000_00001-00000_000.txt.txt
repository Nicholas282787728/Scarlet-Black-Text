The granting of a. Reserve Officers
Training Corps unit to Grinncll at this
time is the result of an application
made late in November at the time oi
the announcement of the intended dc»
mobilization of the S. A. T. C.

Agitation tor the establishment of
'an R. o. T. C. at Griunell was initiatcdi

parcdncss and has been continued up
to the present time.

The Reserve Officer's Training Cm‘li’s
is not in the least like the military
training offered by the S. A. T. C.
The training is not compulsory. The
government does not compcl anybody
to enroll in the corps. College :tutllori»
ties may, however, allow the men to
take this drill instead of the regular
physical training work.

The government provides uniforms
for the men and assigns officers to
direct the training. This consists of
three hours a week minimum of drill,
witnonc additional hour a week for
theoretical instruction. The men may
live where they please and will not be
subject to military discipline crcopt
duﬁng drill hours. Barracks are not
to be maintained.

None of the expenses of the men will
be met by the government except durs
ing the summer camps to which the
men will be sent. At these camps,
however, all expense will be met by
the government, Also, men, who have
had military training previous to the
S, A. T. C. will have part of their subs
sistence paid for to encourage them to
continue the work,

At the end of two years a certain
number of men will receive commiss
sions as reserve officers.

violinist, comes to Grinnell tonight for
the second time to give a concert un-
del‘ the auspices of the School of Music

truly American artist ever since she
started appearing in concerts. She
has studied under many of the famous
masters in Europe and has appeared in
concert in all parts of the world and
before many distinguished monarchs
of the countries of Europe. Ono sca-
son she toured the provinces of Eng
land and in the spring of 1905 she
made a tour of forty concerts in South
Africa. Since that time she has tourcd
this country annually. Last year she
toured the cantonments in the country
and appeared in the Liberty theatre of
nearly every camp in the country.

Shc appears tonight at Herrick
Chapel at 8 D, assisted by Axel

The ﬁrst tour of tho series or s
class games were run off accor
schedule. Thc Seniors by winning
from tho Snplloluows and Frosbmcn
tied for second place, With the Juniors,
in the cellar position. i

The ﬁrst game of the series wasr
won by the Soniors, who played thel
Sophomores cit their feet during thcl
entire game by thcir iast passing and
accurate basket shooting. The Sopllo- ;
mores did not seem able to get to,
gcthor at any period of the game and
were torced to take the short end or
the score. ‘

In the second game of the series the
Juniors lost to the Freshmen 20714.
The Juniors presented an entirely new .
lincup, all ot their last year’s team be-
ing in the service. Miller, the Frosh
captain, was unable to play on account
of illness.

The game was rathcr slow, the
teams showing only a little real bass
list ball during the entire game. Tho
.lunio s lost the ganic chiefly thru poor
dctcnsivc work After taking the short
end of a 12-3 score in the ﬁrst half,
the Juniors came back strong in the
second halt and cut down their opponr
ents’ lead to two points. The Fresh
offensive came back and scored three
baskets which put them out of danger-
tor the rest of the game.

, The Seniors continued their winning
streak in the third game, trimming
the Juniors 16 s. The play was too
slow' to be intorcsting and the game
was mar-rod by numerous fouls on both
sidos. Thc Scniors did not play the
game which they put up on chucs-
day, but the play of tho Juniors was
much better than that which they ex-
hibitcd against thc Freshmen. The
The Seniors could not get started thru
the inability of Gettys to get the tips
off at center,

The fourth game between the SophOr
mores and Freshmen was won by the
second-year team 18—10. The teams
were more evenly matched than in any
of the previous games. the Sophomore
aggregation being strongthencd by the
addition of Crane, who put up a good
game on the floor, altho lacking in
ability to get the leather thru the iron
ring.

The Sophomore team looked more
like the tast team of last year than it
did in the first game, and kept the
Frosh on their toes thrnout the entire
gamc. The fast work of the Sophs
kept the Frosh from being dangerous
at any stage of the game.
