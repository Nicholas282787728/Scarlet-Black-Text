Ailllcltc iiiincgcr II. J luill report.
that nineteen men are already signed
up tor tau track. runny of whom will
engage in the cross country contest
to be staged Friday, Oct. 2

The cross country iini will be nrcr
the same course as in previous years.
This is a distance or approximately
tour miles. The start is madc ti-oin
Ward licld, going north and west' till
Broad street is reached, then noith
again across the gel: links ot Grimlcll
Country Club. Here the course torus
cast, following the road to the school
number 2, next turning south until
Eighth aieniie is reached. The inn is
further made str out west along this
avenue and ends with one lap around
the track on Word field.

Roy Brown, '15, took iii-st place in
the cross country contest staged last
year. This prevents him from coin-
peting again. Paul niacCregor, '17,

'and Addison Sprinlile, '13, won sec-
ond and third places respectively.
These men probably will participate
again.

The present cross country record is
19 minutes and 20 seconds, held by
George Clarlr or the class of 1910. No
one has been able to beat this time in
the last six years. Three prizes are
awarded for the ﬁrst, second and third
places, They consist of appropriate
gold. silver and bronze medals.

The majority or men registered for
traclc are nnderclassmen, which points
to underclass winners of the contest.
It is probable that Sprinkle, J. B. Moor
Gregor and paid MaeCi-egor will be
out later in the season. it they do, the
tact that all three of these men are
veterans in or s country contests and
that two have won their G's in track,
will tend to lower the hopes ot undeiu
classmen.

That it tuberculosis sur cy of (mm
hell is to be made immediately attor-
Christmas was brought out at the
meeting of the Boom club iuld other
interested parties held in the assembly
room 01 the Grinnell Savings bank. It
was addressed by Dr. John H. Pack,
of Des lollies, secretary of the Iowa
Association for the study and Preven-
tion of Tuberculosrs, who made a very
interesting talk and sketched the plan
of the survey.

Tile plan is to send a trained nurse,
experienced in detecting tubercular
cases to Grinnell immediately after
Christmas, and she, in cooperation
with the doctors, will make a careiul
canvass of the community. The re-
sults thus secured will be tabulated
and will be used as an indication of
the need for a. tuhcr-culor hospital in
this county.

The members of the Doctor club
are cniltusid tic over the plan, which
ihcy hope will be an important tactor
in promoting better health conditions
in Gi-inhcli.
