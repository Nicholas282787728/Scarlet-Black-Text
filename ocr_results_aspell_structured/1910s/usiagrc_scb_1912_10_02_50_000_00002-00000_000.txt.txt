If;
FOOTBALL EVERY DAY.

Now if ever is the time for Grin-
nell people to talk football. The
season proper opens next Satur-
day and it is up to us now to show
what the spirit of the year will be,
\Ve feel conﬁdent that the season
will develop a team that will make
us, straighten our shoulders when-
ever the word “football" is men-
tioned, but right now it is lime for
us to talk football, encourage the
men who are getting out and to re-
solve to treat all comers as true
sportsmen should. The Grinnell
Spirit must be seen to be believed.

PROSPECTS ARE IMPROVING.
Several people are thinking of
coming to Grinnell next year, we
know, because the names of thirty-
three “prospective students” are
on our list. Of this number nearly
half were sent by alumni. of
course thirty-three is is. goodly
number but even if 'several more
names are left in the Seerlet and
Black'box we shall endeavor to see
that letters lire written them and
that occasional copies of our paper
are mailed them. Let’s have a. big
Freshman class next year.

The Scarlet and Black is always
ready to print communications on
live topics, but the editor must
know from whom they come.
Three hundred words ought to be
a maximum, for articles of this
kind, too, Evil communicatisr
