With Smalley probably out of the

daily progress, prospects for the opens

although by no means hopeless. Pal-ir—

men on their heals With paddles, and
after their songs and dances before
the sleepy-eyed girls, who were none
too Willing to see the Tim of the thing,
they made tracks for the dormitories
again. It was over as suddenly as
it started, and maybe some of the
sleepy [l'osll had hardly fully awakened
before they werc'~in bed again.

No one can verify the rumor, but
it is hinted that the sophs instigated
the little outing to get it back at the

lI.'S. GREAT PRIIFITEER
NATIIINiYS SMILEY

Italy Spent Six-Eighths of Her
National Wealth to Help
Win the War.

“We stand out as a great proﬁteer
nation," said Prof. Smiley in a chapel
talk Friday morning. “This is no time
to say we are not concerned in Euro-
pean affairs. Bolshew‘sm in Italy
means bolshevism here. We must
realize that our wealth does not be
long to us and we must aid our allies
who are facing iinancial ruin."

“All of the allies had some selﬁsh
motives for entering the war," he con-
tinued, "but perhaps Italy was the
least altruistic. She wished to rec-
tify her northeast boundary which was
only partly established when she push-
ed Austria back seventy years ago.”

Italy Millie Greet Sacriﬁces.
Comparing the sacriﬁce of Italy
with that of the United States. Prof.
Smiley said that Itsly sent ﬁve million
men to the front, one-half of whom
were killed and one million of whom
were wounded. In addition thousands
suffered in Austrian prison camps. If
the United States had lost propsrtio
ally, we would have sent sixteen mi
lion men to France and would have
suffered three million casualties.

Italy spent six-eighths of her na—
tional wealth in this war and sf.
eighths of our national wealth would
be two hundred and twentyrsix bi
lions. That looks pretty small beside
the twenty-one billions that we act-
ually spcnt.

Prof. Smiley has only recently re
turned from Italy where he spent ten
months in war work.

Will the person who took a straight
handle black silk umbrella. from the
entrance of the gym the night of the
”General” kindly leave it at the Herald
office?

[IRINNELI MEN AID

Marshal to Fight Forest
Fire in Rockies.

Ed Young,
Thomas. '23, While camping in Mon-
land this summer, were drafted by the
U. S. Fire Marshal to Join fill the able
bodied men in the vicinity of Monarch,
Mont. in ﬁghting the forest tire which
raged on a small range of the Rockics
near there.

This particular ﬁre was started by
careless campers and it proved to be
a stubborn affair to contend with,
since it was a. crown ﬁre. A crown
tire is impossible to stop until it
reaches show or an open ﬁeld. ,For
this reason the rangers never try to
stop such a ﬁre except in the valleys.
This they do by cutting iii-e lanes,
which are about ﬁltecn feet Wide.
However, in this particular case the
ﬁre was so strong that it jumped these
loncs several times. This meant that
new lanes had to be cut,

rn-c Is Wonderful Sight

Young says that a forest fire is a
most wonderful sight. White ashes
fall for miles around like a heavy snow
storm The sun Shining thru the
densc smoke has the appearance of a
huge red hall/ while at night. the ﬁres
which burn at a great height, make
the surrounding country as light as
day.

At slack moments the ﬁghters
amused themselves by chasing small
cubs and other animals up and down
the lanes and by watching the thou
sands of birds flying in front of the
tire.

Rangcr stations, connected by tele-
graph and more recently by wireless,
are located throughout the mountain
forest regions. The rangers have the
some authority as military command-
ers have in time of war. They may
take over hotels, lodging and boarding
houses for the use fo their ﬁre ﬁghts
ers. They may draft automobiles,
teams or anything they need, for their
use. They also have the privilege of
drafting all ablebudicd men for the

 

purpose of ﬁghting forest ﬁres.

and Black, is rapidly recovering from
