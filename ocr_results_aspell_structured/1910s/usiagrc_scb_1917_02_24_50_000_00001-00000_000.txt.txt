The extensive changes in the Me
quircd studies at Grinnell, which were
irrst announced in the last issue oi
The Scarlet and Black, have imally
been completed and approved by the
iaeulty, and ivere announced this
morning.

The abolishing oi the Bachelor of
Science degree was perhaps the most
noticeable change. Her-carter the col-
lege will give the bachelor oi Arts de-
gree ior completion or the regular ioni-
year course with any subyect as major,
and the Bachelor oi Music degree ior
the completion oi the special course in
the School oi Music.

ruiir choice, lliiili. or iireek.

The~ehanges in the group require-
ments begin as early as the freshman
year. The iirst year students here
aiter may take their choice oi a course
in mathematics as oiiei-ed at present,
or oi six hours work in Greek or Late
in, in addition to their required lang-
uage work.

The requirement or one year's work

in hinglish and oi a three hour course‘

in scrence remains as betore. A year's
wurk in history, economics, or politi-
cal science will still he required.
‘l'hat has been known as the require-
ment in philosophy, however, is now
denominated a requirement in psy~
chology or philosophy and may be met
by any one of three courses offei ed by
these departments, including a. new
three hour course which will be of-
Iered by Fmiessor Millard m the hist-
cry of phllosophy.
Twenty Hours Language.

In language all Students must pr
Sent twenty hours, ten of which must
be of half-major grade. There is no
requirement as to what languages
must he studied, and the modern lang-
‘unges may be substituted 101' the Clas
105 without any stipulation as to ma:
jar and minor under this arrangement.
as has been the case before.

Indrvrdual students can probably dew

teriliinc how these changes Will aiiect
them, but the Registrar states that she
will be glad to consult with any who
feel uncertain about the matter. She
has requested, however, that no in-
quiries along this line be made until
after-
more accurate irrior-rrration will be on
hand for all students and no special
investigation will need to be made for
each case.
Entrance IS Easier.

A third change has been made in re-
gard to entrance subjects, which will
make it possible For a student to enter
Grriinell without having studied an
ancient language, provided he has suit-
able substitutes for it in modern lang-
uages, mathemati ~, science, etc. These
students so ildlnittcd must be from
accredited high schools, and must have
made distinctly lrrgh averages in their
preparatory school worh

students, and that is English.

The reason for th - change is that
the college believes it t not good edu-
cational policy to require or students
wilo cuter college that they carry ex-
tra work iii order to remove en ance
deficiencies. This new plan more adee
quately meets the need oi a large nuine
ber of high school students.

tonipulsory Training.

The question oi military
which has become trillion»
the last iew weesk, has brought forth
numerous advocates and opponents on
the Grinucll campus.

That Grihnell should take a lead
among midwestern colleges, either tor
or against military training, is the
view oi all approached on the subject.
Just what iorm is wanted and what
would be the best, no one seems to
know. The opinion of urose recently
back iroin the border is that compul-
sory military- training in colleges is
inevitable, and they are willing to do
their "hit" with the rest. Others seem
to iavor a series oi lectures by some
military expert to give a better knowle
edge oi war methods

“harder Ciiiiip rt riiiliu-e," Says.

“Red” McLai'en, whose time in the
servree has just recently expired,
states that compulsory military train-
ing would be a fine thing and that it
will undoubtedly come within iour
years. As he puts it, “The guards
will have to come ironi some place.
and it they can be trained in college
they will he better prepared.” It is
his view that ii many more summer
camps are held like the one on the
border, the men will become so dlSsaLr
lsl d that they will not enlist in state
m as hereaiter. The camp idea in
times oi peace has not succeeded on
the harder, he thought.

All the students who have expressed

oi the whole situation as he looked at
it when he said, “Knowledge oi war

He also emphasized the matter oi
discipline and obedience to orders as
a lasting result oi such training in
college.

17—15, indicates fairly well the close—
iiess oi the play. The iii-st liali was
distinctly Iowa’s, but Grinnell certain-
ly carried oii the honors in the second.
The outstanding icaiiires oi the game ‘
were iast, accurate passing, strenuous
iloor work, and air tight guarding. It
was a heart breaking contest or speed.
and there was not a dull moment in it.
It lacked the brilliance, perhaps, oi
lormer contests, as there were iew, ii
any, sensational baskets, The Iowa
team seemed to miss Banhick little, ii
any, and they certainly displayed a,
iiruch better all around oiiense, than
they did when they were depending on
the work or their individual star-.-
