(From The Purdue Exponent).

America's colleges have proved that
they ring true by the sterling peiu
romances of their sons in rnllyiug to
the’ cause or Democracy. Even the
pr-oiessional iokesters have realized
that the “college mall" shit is no ion-
ger appreciated. The college man has
Justiﬁed his e istence; and the joke-
sters no longer carry the crowd with
them when they attempt humor- at the
etpense of the college men.

The nation's colleges are said to
have given 150,000 men to the colors.
ehclusll‘e of the s, A. T. C. force. And
01 that glorlDlls con ibutioo, ht least
5,000 gave up their lrves “that the 118:
tron and the world might live.”

tirrrirt Sternnilnot. 'zd.

Alina hiatcrs have heard at the “'l

complishinciits oi the sons with pride
and joy, mingled with grrol at the loss
oi so many of the young men in whose
hands the destinies of the nation will
lie in the next decade.

The college man is made of the
right stuii, otter all.

And the poor funny man loses zoo-
other inspiration.

THE END 01“ A PERFECT DAY.
(From The Michigan Daily.)

Did you ever wake up on one of
these ﬁne mornings and feel that you
just about owned the World? You
jump out of bed as full of energy as a
dynamo, and you are ready to do a
week's work before dinner.

You sally forth to your eight o'clock

with a swing to your stride and that

joy of living in your step. You take
that empty scat n to that fellow
Jones Nice follow, Jones. You have
alw _ wanted to know him better.
So now you greet him with a nod
and a smile, and you feel so satisﬁed
with yourself that you could sing
aloud.

in a moment or two you notice an

illusive fragrance, a tingling pong
cncy, an odious odor, a la iar—ah
Juicy Fruit! And not only is there
this trespass on your olracto v sense,
but you heeoinc suddeuly aware that
although Jones is speechless, yet he
is not silent. '

You on not escnpe. You can not
dcieml yourself. There is only one
consolation, and thnt is that your tie.

“sir-e to know Jones hetter has he
realized and satisﬁed. Anti you leave
the classroom with most of the joy
oozing out or your vstem, and a
cynical thought taking its place.

There are two kinds or people—
those who ehew gum and those who
don’t.

Due to the unsettled conditions or

that Griuricll has hecri without any

Now let us, the students, made these
dances distinctively Grinnclliau.

To do so means GRINNELL DATES,
