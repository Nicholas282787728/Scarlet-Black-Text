The “Constitution” of Today—Electrically Propelled

HE U. S. S. “New Mexico,” the first

battleship of any nation to be electri-
cally propelled, is one ofthe most important
achievements of the scientiﬁc age. She not
only develops the maximum power and,
with electrical control, has greater ﬂexibility
of maneuver, which is a
distinct naval advantage,
but also gives greater econ-
omy. At 10 knots, her
normal cruising speed, she
will steam on less fuel than
the best turbine-driven ship
that preceded her.

Six auxiliary General Electric Turbine-Gen»
erators of 400 horsepower each, supply
power for nearly 500 motors, driving pumps,
fans, shop machinery, and kitchen and laun-
dry appliances, etc.

Utilizing electricity to propel ships at sea
marks the advancement of
another phase of the elec-
trical industry in which the
General Electric Company
is the pioneer. Of equal
importance has been its
part in perfecting electric
transportation on land,
transforming the potential
energy of waterfalls {or use
in electric motors, develop-
ing the possibilities of electric lighting and
many other similar achievements.

The electric generating
plant, totaling 28,000 horse-
power, and the propulsion equipment of the
great super-dreadnaught were built by the
General Electric Company. Their operation
has demonstrated the superiority of electric
propulsion over old-time methods and a
wider application of this principle in the
merchant marine is fast making progress.
