splendid service rendered by Dr. I-Iel'~
bert F. Evans, in connection with the
Y. M, c. A, work in France. As direc

Areas, he was able, by his untiring cf-
torts to give to his camp the reputa—
tion of being one of the very best in
France.

”We greatly regret that he comes
home somewhat broken in health, and
trust that it he does take up his due
ties at the college his work may be so
arranged as not do burden him unduly
until he shall have fully recovered"

NUVAHSITYDEBATES

Freshmen Will Probably Hold
Only Forensic Event of Year——
No Varsity Coach.

During the

Varsity dcba ng will not be started
this year, according to a decision or
the Debating llumn reached at tlluil"
ﬁrst meeting \vcdnosdny attornoou It
was decided to leave the question oi,
the Merrill and Illtcrsociely debates,“
‘until some latcr time but tbc opinion!
or most of the members present wast
,in favor of discontinuing all dcbatingl
for tho rest of tins college yml'. with}
the exception of the freshmen inter-V
lsucicty debates. 1

Debate prospects wcro unusuallvi
good this rear with three varsity inch 1
‘Slllitll, mud and Meek and two ya i
‘altcrnates, Bochmlcr and bioscr back;
'lu school. Tbcrc was also abundant;
tmotcvial to [reshmcn debate s of last,
year. It was decided, bdwcvrr. that
tbc year will be too crowded with
most or the college events coming
within a few months. The speaking
contests will be scheduled the latter-
part of February and the ﬁrst of
March and the men were in ravor of
concentrating their attention on these
rather than the debates.

There is also the problem of a doe
hating coach to he raced if the debates
are held. Prof. E. D. Strong, former
coach or debating is still in govern-
ment service and Maul c Fridluud,
’18, who coached last year's team, will
be attending the Harvard law school.

Freshmen debates will probably be
held early in the season. but a ﬁnal
decision in regard toihis was not
reached.

The prize for the Merrill debatc,
amounting to the income of $1,000, will
be held over until next year. in case
it is ﬁnally decided not to hold the dc-
hate this year. The next Merrill de-
bate will be between Institute and
Forum societies.
