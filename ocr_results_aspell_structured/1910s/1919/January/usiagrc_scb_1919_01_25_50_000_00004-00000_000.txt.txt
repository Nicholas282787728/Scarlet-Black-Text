L. I... Dickerson Heads Washing-
ton Department—Sends Books
For Overseas Men.

Sending more than 300,000 reference
books to France in a period of ten
days is the work at L. L. Dickerson,
former Grinnell college librarian, now
in charge of the OverrSeas Educa-
tional Work at the United States
Library department at Washington,
D. C. in a letter to Grinneli friends,
he outlines the problems of the office
and tells of his surveys at the largest
nitrate and powder plants in the east.

He Writes, “You probably will he
interested to know that the Army Edur
eational Commission is starting an
ambtious program in France, a pro-
gram, which involves the opening of
advance classes wherever there are
as many as 500 men. The subjects
run from dry farming to Chaucer.

“We are equipping 500 small
libraries in France for this special
Work and in these will place a uni—
form set of from 500 to 1.000 books to
supplement the text book work. We
are prepared to spend an even mile
lion dollars to carry on this work if
advisable."

In telling about the office work in
Washington, Mr. Dickerson says that
they keep a force of 100 workers busy
all day and a night force until mid-
night. Fifty thousand volumes have
been shipped in three days by this
force.

Surveys were made of the big gov—
ernment nitrate plant at Muscle
Shoals, Ala, and the Old Hickory pow-
der plants near Nashville, Tennessee,
for the purpose of establishing library

includes at those places. Mr. Dicker-
son says: "The plant at Muscle shoals
is reputed to have cost sixty million
dollars since last February. They are
making air nitrates there. But the
most magical of all is the big DuPont
Works near Nashville. Housing facilia
ties for 40,000 Were nearly complete
when the armistice was signed and the
plant was producing. There are all
modern facilities for the welfare of
employees,—three community houses
that are superior to any others I have
seen,-they are not unly tremendously
big but they are beautiful. In the war

A circular of the Library War Serv-
ice of the American Library Associar
tion sent by Mr. Dickerson is an ap-
peal for every unused book to ﬁll the
demands of the army in France.

It says in part: "Do not think that
because hostilities have ceased the
need for books for our soldiers over-
seas arc ended. On the contrary, it‘
is even greater than when they were
keyed up by the stimulus or active
warfare."

All kinds at text books are badly

Y. M. ON THURSDAY

Y. M. C. A. Secretary Speaks to
Men on "Left Handed. Men.”

"c'nton Smith, until recently an
army Y. M. c. A. secretary at Camp
Dodge, gave a tall: at the Weckly meet-
ing or the y. in, Thursday night, on
"Left Handed Men."

“In the time of the tribe of Benja—
min,” he said, "left handed men were
considered as worthless, and Benjamin
cast all of them out of his tribe. But
they banded together and practiced
stone throwing, which they were bet-
ter able to do than right-handed men,
and became the sharpshooter: of Ben-
]anlin’s zu'my. Don't think because
you are handicapped that you can’t he
of use. Do what you can, and you
will ﬁnd that your Supposed failing
will probably hc 'our success.”
