THE SECOND STEP.

The second year or dormitory life

has commenced with the beginning or
, the second quartet

At the beginning of last year Grin—
nell men started in on a dormitory
career without precedent or experience
to guide them,

ings here the regular and necessary
activities of existence. Gradually dlse
cover-iss- welc made and precedents

established and at the cud of the year '

a long step lOl‘llal‘d had llccll taken
in the development oi dorlll'ltory life.

At best; however, it was only one
Step on 6 road whose end cannot yet
be seen. For the patsL six centuries
Oxford and Cambridge hare been
steadily building up 3. deﬁnite and dis-
u'nctivc life for its men. The work‘is
not Yet complete and never will he as
long as the universities continue to at—
tract men to their halls.

In beginning this second step G ‘

ncll men have the opportunity or gu-I

ing far in the direction 0! the making
or a deﬁnite and distinctive Grinnell
dormitory atmosphere. The tact that
the present college generation is
pioneering in this work gives their ac<
tlons supreme importance over those
which will come later. Grinnell men
or coming years will he vitally inﬂu-
enced by the forces which are put into
motion in these tormative years.

Precedent. traditions, ideals fostered
in these days will form the lounda-
tion upon which Grlnnell dormitory
lire in the future will either stand or
fall. Consciously or unconsciously
this lite is being developed How
much better if each man sees to it that
his bit is directed along the line or
making the dormitories to come repre—
sentative or the Grinnell spirit.

G—

It would seem that men in advanced
English courses are as scarce as inc
ulty members in chapel.

AN EXPERIMENT.

. When an ill appears the ﬁrst ques-
Lion is what is the cure. A menace to
human happiness is the mysterious
disease of so many varying :tud insid-
'ious forms which, if iatal, results in
tajlure. In seeking the remedy some
help can he obtained by examining the
men who have successfully [ought off
the malady.
Ferdinand Foch.

As thc leader oi six million men repr
resenting as many ditiereut nations,
Marshal Foch was ahlc_,to crush the
invincible armies of Germany and dic-
tate to her humiliating peace tel-ins.
Hardly a conspicuous (allure.

“He is praised, he is blamed. He
does not care. He keeps going!" This
is a quotation applied to him by an
oiiicer who has been intimately con—
nected with him during his campaigns
in me rcccnt war. Marshal Foch did
not escape failure by waiting for suc-
cess. He was not content to obtain a.
good position alld then do his work in
a way which kept it for him but did
not advance himi “He keeps going!"
He didn't mark time.

"To make war is to attack" was his
watchword. The Germans learned the
truth of the statement to their sorrowr
Applied to his own lite it has been
“to live successinlly is to advance."

Snow-white and soul- whiter

The good forefathers dream;
Sky- blue and truc- blue with stars that gleam arighta
The gloried guidon oi the day; a shelter through the night.

To every star and stripe
The Drums beat as hearts beat
And Fliers shrilly pipe!

Home land and far land and half the world around,
Old Glory hears the glad salute and ripples to the sound

And oh, how much it holds——
secure within its folds!

Beat quicker at the sight;

Red and blue and white.
The one Flag, the great Flag, the Flag for me and you——
Gloriﬁed all else beside—the red and white and blue.
