MUHDERED AT MIDNIGHT
SUGGESSFULLY STAGED

Steepten Gore Company With
Vaudeville Couple Make Hit
at W. S. G L Show.

“Murdered at Midnight", presented
by the Stncptin Gore Stock Co, in
Alnnini Recitation hall, Friday, March
7, was .1 “howling" success. With an
all-star cast, the compani- presented
a “heart rent-ling" melodrama to a
very appreciative audience. chinnl
Devere Dalton, the “deep dyed" vile
lain, was convincingly played by Jean-
ette Lowrey, Ruth Glngles was the
gentle hut valient Cm'tcton Gridley,
the hero. As Virginia Dalton. the misr
treated wife or the villain, Mary
Thompson plead pitcously, “Do what
you will with me, but do not unkc the
child.” Helen Hoag as Flossic, a
chorus girl; was sufficiently "chorusy."
Little Willie, the villains son, who
was just “thelven”, was cleverly played
by Pauline Donner.

Stage properties, such as the power
plant and the engine were very
realistic. ’

Lornhel Richardson and Anna Lois
Clark as St. Claire & La Rue gave very
satisfactory presentations of the two
vaudeville acts; "Kids" and “After the
Show."
