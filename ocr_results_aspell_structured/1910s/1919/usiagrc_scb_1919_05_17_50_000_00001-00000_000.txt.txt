“Till lsll Efficiency in Starving Al'—

Scarlet and Black. The article states
that since President Main ' regarded
as ”Conservative and judicial rather
than emotiunal in temperament" the
message thus acquires greater force.

there is not enough effort needed on

“You ask if all Ru ians are as uni

The people understand that they are

America permit Germany to gain con-

Mme. Bresbkovsky opened her lec-
ture by telling something of her own
experiences at the hands of the for-
mer government. When she was still
very young she began to teach the
peasants on her latheris land. Before
long she was arrested and after being‘
held for three years under conditions
too strenuous for many to withstand
she was scuieneed to ten years It
held labor. At the end of three and a.
half years she was rcleased from bdrd
labor and placed in solitary conduc-
ment in Siberia.

Conditions Bull In Siberia.

In telling of conditions in Siberia
she said: “We were g en very. little
food, we could neither ,ceive or write
letters, were not allowed to get news
of on. sort, and under no circumstan-
ces were w , allowed to see each other.
The government thinking that we
would ‘vc rrp after this tomo-c sent
officials .to see each one of us who
were in solitary conﬁnement and I am
very glad to be able to say that not
one of them would repent their acts
and return to Pctrograd."
