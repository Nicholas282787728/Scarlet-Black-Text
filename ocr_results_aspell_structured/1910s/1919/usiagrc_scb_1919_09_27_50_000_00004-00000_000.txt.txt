RAWS N REFUSES
TO BE CANDIDATE

Former Grimeuian Withdraws
From Gubernatorial
Contest.

Charles A. Rnwson, of Des Moincs,
one of the biggest boosters [or Gilmell
athletics and who has always befriendv
ed the Scarlet and Black in every
way, has announced his withdrawal
from the coming guhematorlztl race.
This comes as a disappointment to
Grinnell alumni and students, as they
had counted on the Des Monies man
as the strongest entry in the moo.

Before going to France with the
Y. M. C. A. last winter, Mr. Dawson
annnnnoed his intention of being a
Candidate for the highest state honor,
but since his return he ﬁnds that the
business situation will not allow him
to make the necessary campaign. The
race has now narrowed down to
Moore, Havner, Kendall, Deeins nod
Keuhnle.

Mr. Rowson has hundreds of friends
among Grinnoli alumni, all of whom
had hoped to support him in his com-
paign for the Republican nomination.
