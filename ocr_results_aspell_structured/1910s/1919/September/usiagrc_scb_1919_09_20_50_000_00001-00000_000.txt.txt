“General,” Will

The annual General Reception,
which will be held this evening at the
Men's Gymnasium, promises to be
tamer and more uninteresting than
ever. The committee has been work-
ing hard on the arrangements and in
spite of their earefulness, some un-
lucky (or lucky) men are escorting a
whole squad of fair young damsels
to the annual “Deception."

In an effort to make the party calls
more enjoyable, the committee has
provided informal entertainments in
each cottage. '

You cannot afford to miss the Gen—
eral, whether you are in school for
the ﬁrst time or not. Who knows?
Maybe you will see some attractive

SMILEY BACK FROM WORK
IN OVERSEAS Y. M. G. A.

Who Italians are loyal to the Alps
eriean people," said Prof. C. N. Smil-
cy, in an interview, with a Scarlet and
Black reporter. “Before the trouble
ovcr Flume, President Wilson was
worshipped almost as a Saint, after-
wards he was regarded as a rascal,
but the feeling of kinship with the
American people never wavered. The
Italians were more courteous to us
after the trouble than before, if pos-
siblo."

Prof. Smiley, who has just return-
cd from a year's sci-Vice with the
Italian army in the Y. M. C. , was
so fortunate as to be in Paris during
the celebration over the signing of
the Armistice. The excitemcnhcould
not be imagined, Ilc says, and the
affectionate demonstrations of the
French toward the Americans was al—
most embarrassing.

In Italy, Prof. Smiley’s ﬁrst work
was at Mirandola with the Italians
who were returning from Austrian
prison camps. From every traihload
of prisoners numbers were taken off
to die from starvation, as the dict of
the Italians in Austria had consisted
exclusively of boiled carrots ‘

From Mirandola Prof. Smiley was
sent to Naples where he was regional
director of south Italy for seven
uioiiths. The territory included eight
hospitals at Naples and sixty at Flor-
ence, where mutilated soldiers were
being cared for. American soldiers
who were on leave of absence were
looked after also, and given free trips
and a pleasant tune. Thirteen Y. M.
C. A. men assisted Prof. Smiley in
this work.

The last mouth of his stay Prof.
Smiley was educational director for
the Y. I. c. A. in Italy. This work
was divided in two parts: classes in
English for officers in the Italian
army, and classes in ‘eading and writ-
ing Italian for the illitoi-ates. Eighty
per cent of the people of south Italy
are illiterate, so there was a great
opportunity for service in the second
Class. This Work was organized under
Italian sergeants who had been train-
ed in normal schools. One training
school was located at Milan.

Prof. Smiley landed at New York
Aug. 9th, and ’came at once to resume

s duties in the college. /

mendation and appointment by a com-
mittee of five men in each state. The

of Pres. Jessup all of these men are
Rhodes scholars.

the committee this year on scholastic
abilit Athletics and outside activi-
ties will be considered secondarily.

permitted to offer four candidates for
the Rhodes scholarship. The ﬁrst
student receiving the appointment will
leave for Oxford to commence his
studies in October. The'second will
start in January.

The Rhodes scholarship fund was
established by the will of Cecil
Rhodes, the famous British explorer
'alld statesman.

it provides for a fund of $1500 year-
ly, to go to the student Winning the
scholarship. Owing to the increase of

Carelessness Results
In Horrible Death
To Ancestor

Did you ever hear the story of the
mystery creature whose bones are
shamelessly displayed in the College
museum? It is a sad tale, and proves
the old saying that pride goeth before
a fall. Here are the facts (7)

In the days when Iowa Wzls swamp
and quicksand, long centuries before
the time of colleges, or general recepe
tions, it was inhabited by birds and
tree animals, who lived a peaceful and
contented existence, for from annoying
intruders.

One (lay, however, there was a ter-
rible disturbance. A monstrous and
terrible animal came bursting into this
tranquil place, threatening to destroy
the peaceful inhabitants. Just as he
was about to do his worst, a kind prov—
idence guided his feet into a quick
sand, and he was swallowed up in a
iffy—tn be feared no more.

So he remained, unhonorcd and

unsung, until some of his bones were
found under the corner of Fourth Av-
