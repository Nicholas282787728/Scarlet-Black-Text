MAN RELIGIOUS BY NATURE.

“Religion is the universal conscious-
ness of an unseen presence," declared
H. L. Haywood at Vespers Sunday
afternoon. "Man is religious by his
Very nature,” he continued, "and the
realization of an unseen presence is
the basis of our highest accomplish-
ments. This mystery expressed would
disclose inﬁnite tenderness and love."

Your Name Is Ruth?
You Are One of
Many.

is your name Ruth, Helen, Mary,
Elizabeth or Dorothy?

if it is, you belong to “the common
herd." A peek at the college direc-
tory tells us that there arc 20 girls
named Ruth and lo who answer to
the name or Helen. The Dorothys
and Marys are tied with 14 each and
Elizabeths and Franccses claim 13
apiece. The Margarets only count
12. but there are several Margciys and
lliariories to make up for their poor
showing.

Some of the more distinctive names
of college women may he traced to
French. Spanish, italian and Indian
sources. But alas! pour Yorick! A
great many or them are "just names"
and that‘s all there is to it.

Did you ever hear at these names he-
rore you came to Grlnnell: Ngai, Adri-
enne. Charlene, Gatesie, Izetta, No-

Gouldi

There are several “only ones or
their kind" in school this year, for in.

Rosmel‘, Zaneta, Zella, Millie, Wanda,
Anginette, Lorene, Wynona, La Nor.
Isa, Ardath, nude. Dona, Eifrella,
Estherlee, Clementine, Zeta and Reta.

New read the list over again. Don’t
they suggest to Your mind Lhe rest of
the name? That's Where these girls
seem to have it on their less torn»
nate sisters who have not a name hut
a label. But perhaps that’s putting it
too strong.

Ho-hum. what's in a name?

Certain Strikes Are

are involved should he declared un-

ed D. W. Norris, editor of the Mar-

cent address. ‘

”We are in a state of social on.
rcst, but conditions will eventually
right themselves. I'IOWeVer, agitators
should not be permitted to take ad—
vantagc of the present situation and
cause tie-ups oi public necessitels.
Compulsory arbitration is the only
relief incasure that will be erlective."
