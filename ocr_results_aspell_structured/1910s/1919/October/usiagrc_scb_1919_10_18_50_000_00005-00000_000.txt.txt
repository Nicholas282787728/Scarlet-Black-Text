THE REIGN OF THE RAIN.

In the time when 'twas dry

From mine-shaft to sky,

When the ﬁelds all were Here

That were anywhere near,

We sighed lol- the Reign of the Rain.

In the time of smell crops

When the brnnks were all stone
And the deWs were all glme,
We sighed {or the Reign at the Rain.

But the season came on '

When the Ford Wouldnt run,

And the garden was flooded all o'er,

And the rain beat in at the dour.

Then v;e.MOC!CED at the Reign or the
am.

New we can't well altord

To feel quite so bored;

1!. it's dry and not Wet do nut fret!

If it's wet and not dry don't forget

How we’ve mocked at the Reign of
the Rain. S. El. W
