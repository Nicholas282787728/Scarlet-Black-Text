Traveling in a special Pullman car,
and given a big Sendrctf by the crowd
of routers who came down to the sta»
tion, the Grinneil football team left at
6:45 last night for St. Louis, where
they play Washington University this
afternoon. This will be the second
Missouri Valley conference game for
the Scarlet and Black.

Plans on leav'lng were to drop the
Pullman at some town along the way,
so that the men could get a good
night's rest. Continuing the journey
this morning. they expected to arrive
in St. Louis before noon. Accompany—
ing the team were Coach Tollefson,
Doc Huff, Trainers Hoyt :Lnd Yarn,
and Dr. Hopkins. A number of fans
also made the trip on the Pullman.

Whit-mer Taken with Team.

Despite his crippled knec, “'hitmer
Was taken on the trip, although the
chances are slim that he can get into
the game. He was still using a
crutch, and unless the need is great he
will probably remain on the sidelines.
Shoesmlth, who broke a small hone in
his hand in practice this Week, vas
able to return to practice last night.

Coaches and men realize that today’s
game is one of the hardest on the sea—
son’s schedule. Coming out on top
of last year's championship scramble,
the Pikers are out after another vice
tory. They are reinforced this year

Contrary to the sentiments express

T. Spencer has discovered that the
Democratic administration is appar-
ently putting on an honest administl'a‘

Two years ago Professor Spencer
heeded the call of patriotism and funk
ed over a ﬁfty dollar pair of special
lens ‘opera glasses in response to the
government’s call. The nominal sum
of one dollar was paid for the glasses.

Having classiﬁed the glasses with

Not so the government. The glasses

BEAUTY CONTEST Ti]
BE GYGTQTEFEATURE

Beauty Contest To Be Revived in
”Super-Cyclone” —— Hold
Signup Monday.

A contest open to everyone to ﬁnd
the best ﬁghting name for Grinncll's
athletic teams Will be opened next
Monday under the auspices of the
Honor G Club. A mice of one frcc
1921 Cyclone will he oiferde to the
person submitting the best name for
Grinnell’s teams.

Blanks to be ﬁlled out with the sug-
gested name are printed on the ﬁrst
page of the Scarlet and Black today.
They will be collected at tables which
will be provided for that purpose Mon-
day and Tuesday in the lower hall of
the Recitation building. Contributions
in the way of yclls, songs and slogans
will also be received at these tables.

Athletes Are/Nameless.

Since Grinnell cntcred inter»eol»
legiate athletics, her teams have
gone into battle without a
name other than warriors for the Scar-
let and Black. The need of some sin»
gle‘word to denote our athletes has‘
materially hampered the Grinnell root~

 

by several stars who returned from
the army. Reports emanating from the
Piker camp indicate that the st. Louis ,
players are in line condition. Coach,
Rutherford has been di ling his merit
hard all week in breaking up crinncll.
plays and in perfecting his offense.
Captain criesedeck and Mal-nuard.
who have been on the hospital list, are
back in the fold and will he in action
today. ‘
Expect Iteversnl of Form.
While Grinnell fans realize that the
game last week must be discounted be-l
cause of the obvious off-form dis
played by the Scarlet team, they are
not expecting too much from today’s
contest. coach Tollefson has been
drilling his men in tackling aild pass»
ing, on which they appeared weak in‘
.the Dubuqne game. Grinnell support‘
ei‘s al'evcunﬁdeht that the team \vill,‘
have regained the form which it diSr!
played at times in the Ames game. ‘
The lineup today will be slightly
changed hccause or'tlie absence of
'Whitmcl‘ and Schultz. Knies will
probably be started at center, although
Dauhenhergcr may go in at tacklc and
McLai'en talre the pivotal position as
he did in the game last weck. Knres

college, and should give a good ac-
count of himself. Minty will start at
Schultz’s half, as Schultz ' still suf-
fering from an injury to h. shoulder.
Minty displayed one form in the Du—
buque game, and should almcfu' lo
good advantage today. The remainder
o: the lineup will be the some as that
which started against Dilbuque.

ORIGINAL COMPOSITION BY
HENRY IS WELL RECEIVED

Ah audience which packcd Herrick
chapel greeted Miss Margery Maxwell,
soprano of the Chicago Grand Opera
company. and Hr. Harold Henry, pia
ist, who appeared in a joint recital in
the second number of the recital
course last night.

A telegram received Thursday aftr
ernoun reported that Miss Frances In-
grani, who was originally scheduled to
appear. would be unable to come to
Grinnell because of illness. Miss Maxi
well, however. proved to be a very
worthy substitute.

Generous With Elicorcs.

Miss Maxwell greatly pleased the
audience with her gracious umnner.
She has a voice which is rich and
beautiful in quality, and she sang .with
an case which pleased. “Waters or
Minnetonlrzt”, by Lienrauce, “as up-
preciated by the audience perhaps
more than any other number. as the
depth and quality of Miss Maxwell’s
voice appeared to particular advantaze
in this song. Miss Maxwell l'el gen»
erously responded to the eneo of
the audience, giving one encore attcr
her ﬁrst group of songs and two alter
the second group. “0 Didn’t It Rain,”
a Negro sp ual hy Burlcigh, coming
as it did immediately after last night’s
momentary downpour, amused and de-
lighted the audience.

Displays Finished Technique

Mr. Harold Henry must also come
in for a large share of the honors at
the evening's concert. His technique
was especially ﬁne, and was displayed
to good advantage. “The Dancing
Marionette”, one of the piznlst’s own
compositions, was appreciated to such

an extent that the audiencc made the-

artist repeat the number. Brahm's
"Ballade op. 10 No. 4" was perhaps
the second choice of the audience, al-
though the "Fantasia quasi sonata"
was also Very popular. This was the
heaviest numbel' on the program, and
was well executed by Mr. Henry. Mr.
Henry had a great deal of variety tu
his program, and he combined poetic
imagination with skilled technique to
make real musicianship.

\VASHINGTON, D. C., Oct. 25.¥PrcsV
ident Wilson today issued the follow-
ing proclamation to the members 0!
the American Red Cross and to the
citizens of the United States of Amer—
ica:

"AS President of the United States
and as President of the American Red
Cross, I recommend and urge a gener—
our response to the Third Red Cross
Roll Call which opens on November
the eleventh, the ﬁrst anniversary of
the signing of the Armistice.

"Twenty million adults joined the
Red Cross during the War, prompted
by a patriotic desire to render service
to their country and to the cause for
which the United States was engaged
in War. Our patriotism should Stand
the test of peace as Well as the test
of War, and it is an intelligently par
tl‘iotic program Which the Red Cross
proposes, a continuance of service to
our soldiers and sailors Who Tool: to it
for many things. and a transference
the problems of peace at home of the
experience and methods which it ac—
quired during the war.

Monitor-ship Important.

“It is on membership more than
money contributions that the stress of
the present campaign is laid, for the
Red Cross socks to associate the peo—
ple in welfare Work thruout the
land, especially in those communities
where neither official nor unofficial
provision has been made for adequate
public health and social service.

It is in the spirit of democracy that!
the people should undertake their own
welfare activities. and the National
Red Cross wisely intends to exert upon
community action a stimulating and
coordinating influence and to place
the energies of the organization he-
hind all sound public health and wel»
fare agencies.

End Foreign Ilcliei.

The American Red Cross does not
purpose indeﬁnite prolongation ot its
relief Work abroad, a, policy which
would lay an unjust burden upon our
own people and tend to undermine the
self-reliance of the pecplcs relieved,
But there is a ncccssary Work of com-
pletiun to be performed before thel
American Rcd Cross can honorably
Withdraw from Europe. The Congress
of the United states has imposed upon
the Red Cross 1!. continuing respollsr

tary of War to transfer to the emeri.
can Red Cross such surplus army
medical supplies and supplementary
and dietary food stuffs now in Europe
as shall not be required by the army,
to be used by the Red Cross to relieve
the distress which continues in certain
countries of Europe as a result of the
war.

ncscrvcs Illltliusiltstic Support.

To ﬁnance these operations, to emu
clllde work which w s begun duringv
the war, and to carry out some come
pal'atively incxpcnsive constructive
plans for assisting peoples in eastern
Europe to develop their own welfare
organizations, the AlllCl’iCElll Red Cross
requires, in addition to members 'p
ices, a Sum of money small ill com-
parison with the gifts poured into its
treasury by our gcncrous people dur—
ing the war.

Both the gl'ezttcl' cndul'ing domestic
program and the lesser tcrnporary for»

hope that its peacetime membership

Red Lights Remind Noise
Makers Tn Use Soil Paddle

The Quadrangle loggia has recently
brought forth a crop of beautiful red
lights. It is rumored that their burn

necessary pianissimo.

Of course, the more poetic girls,
when they start up the loggia, shiver»
ing, to breakfast. say that the rosy
blow makes them think of sunrise in
the springtime ’n’ everything, but
whatever you think of, the fact re
mains that in front of each cottage a
red light sheds its warning ray. Those
who live on the loggia say its a danger
signal; it will be dangerous for any-
one hereafter to come down that ruddy
district at some unearthly honr ex-
plaining to her roommate with squeals
