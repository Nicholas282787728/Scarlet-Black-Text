"No mans philosophy of lile is atlcr

the note of tragedy in life that is heard
by us all at some time or another, and
meet it triumphantly." declared Rev.

"There is no way to escape these
unexpected tragedies of line, but we
can shape our own experience. What
anything is to you depends on What
A man must determine the

“Socially. we are in the midst of
Pan's pipings. with unrest on every
