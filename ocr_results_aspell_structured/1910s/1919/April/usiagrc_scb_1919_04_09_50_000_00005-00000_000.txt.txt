team of two years ago. who had re—
cently been discharged from the navy,
was substituted at center in the sec—
ond half of this game.

On February 15 the locals won from
the state Teachers. Exeept lor the
close ﬁnish, the score being 18-17, it
was largely devoid 01 interest.

Fast Game With Amos.

Ames provided the fastest game of
the season on the home ﬂoor when the
Sesrlet and Black defeated them 25—20.
The tardy but successlul winning rally
was started by Hammond with a baSr
km, from the center of the floor. The
Ames mix was the fourth conference
game, Grinnell now having won three
and lost one.

Huff's men rcceived the worst drubr
hing of the season in the return game
with Cornell played here February 2s.
The local ﬁve went. to pieces as the
40-15 score testiﬁes.

By a. narrow margin Gi‘innell lost at
Amcs the iollowing week. This defeat
dropped the Scarlet from second to
fourth place in the conference. Crane
and Winter starred for Grinnell and
allho the locals outplayed the State
College in the second half the score
was 2522

Drake Loses Again.

There were two more conference
games to Wind up the season after
the Bulldﬂgs were met and defeated
in in midweek game. The Blue and
White staged a. last-minute rally but
Were unable to gain the lead, the con-
test ending 1546. The giant guards,
Gettys and Winter, starer for Grin-
nell.

Nebraska. defeated the local team :at
Lincoln in the ﬁrst 0! 3. two-game 'ser—
ies. The ﬁnal crack of the revolver
cut short a Grinnel! rally which left
the Combuskers on the long end of
the 27~15 score. In lnis game Ham-

mond scored seven or Grinneu's 15
points.

The Iowans took revenge intho clos-
ing game 01' the season, however, by
nosing out the Nebraslmns 22—91. As
in the second Dmkc game, Captain
Hammond helped to win with his phe—
nonlenal foul-shooting, realizing six
free throws out of eight chances.
Linn’s guarding was also a feature or
the game. This win ended Lhe season
and tied Gi'innell with the Huskers
for third conference honors.

Seven Chief Men.

Tile chicl men representing Grinncll
during the past season were Hams
mend, Crane, and Evans at forward;
Winter, Linn and Gettys all. guard; and
DeRuytur and Gettys at center. Han»
mood starred with his baskermshuot»
ing, and Crane, probably the lasLesl
man on any Iowa, basketball team,
with his wonderful floor work. Evans
showed up well at times but was iu~
consistent. Winter was Grinncll's best
bet at guard, always putting up a.
steady game and playing thrnout the
entire season except for about ﬁve
minutes. Linn, tho small, was a Scl‘ir
ous handicap to any forward, and
starred particularly in the fl 1 game
with Amos. Gettys, who started the
season at center, was switched to sub-
sctltule guard. His I'ﬂnginess and og
gressivencss made him quite Valuable.
DeRuchi‘ played a. polished game at
comer and at times appeared like it
third forward.
