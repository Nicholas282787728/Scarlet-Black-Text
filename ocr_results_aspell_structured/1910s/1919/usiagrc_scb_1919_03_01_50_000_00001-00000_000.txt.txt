scoring. Cornell scored almost at

"Grinnell," he continued, “is unique
in the fact that its chapel is a minus
tary scr cc rather than a compulsory
one.‘ Practically every other college
in the country holds a compulsory
chapel service. but Gl‘illnell feels that
the {value at such a sewico is seriously
impaired by any idea of compulsion.
but m such an illeztl to succeed we
must have the support of the students.

“There is a great distinction bcr
twccn the words compulsory and
obligatol-y,'; said Prof. Noble. . lsiiy
things such as voting and our loyalty
to friendship are obligatory but can-
not be said to be compulsory. Cul-
chapel scrvicc, zllLllo it is not complll»
sci-y, should be looked upon by the
students as an obligation which they
owe to themselves and to Grinncl.
