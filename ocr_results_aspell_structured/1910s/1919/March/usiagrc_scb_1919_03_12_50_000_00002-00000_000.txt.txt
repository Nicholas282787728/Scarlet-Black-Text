It has been said that patience is a
yii‘tue. Someoiic else has added, aptly
' indeed, that patience in time ceases

this attribute. Perhaps that man lived

in the dormitories, and had waited, par
tieiitly, for those dormitories to he
christened. .

_ Scarcely anything remains to he
said on the subject of naming the 0101's
mitories This topic, which has so
long been a favorite with Scarlet and
Black editors, and a by-word with
contributors to "What-DosYou-Think”,
has been nearly exhausted. But still
we continue to reside in Buildings
I-VI. St‘ill visitors remark on the
beauty and attractiveness of the
Building i elubroom. Must this
continue indeﬁnitely? ,

Griuncll has a number of famous
alumni who, if the ‘matlel' were
brought to their attention, would

» doubtless gladly lend their names to
the dormitory buildings occupied'by
the men. Certainly no appellations
would be more pleasing to the men
themselves for their college homes
than the names of these former Grin»
nelliaus who have attained fame in
the world outside. A certain high
standard would at once assert itself
to the hiiildiiig named after a particu-
lar individual which would be main-
tained as a living memorial to him,
and would serve as a reminder of the
higher things even after his death.

Doubtless this principle could be ap—
plied to the quadrangle cottages as
well. A recent communication from
a Gi-inncll woman on the subject indi—
cates that the feminine pul'ﬁou of the
college are asgeztgel' as the men to
have their units given permanent
names.

Grinnell honors and respects her
graduates and ex-sttidents. What bet-
ter method could we choose of showA
ing to them our appreciation of their

services, past and present, than by‘

naming for them our college homes?

WHAT} Ilﬂ‘ YDU THINK?

_ ‘iHIEN‘,

The tiiiio will come when Griiinoll
will change her social traditions to
keep pzteu nitli het- ltoi ~tic enrolh
iiicitt and athletic progr in most
unis Griiiiicll has made tremendous
strides, but social tlirie hasn't been
iiiitcli iiuprorenicnt in the last twenty
years. (irinnoll is no longer 1]\’U\il\»

lego ranks hill; the best in the Middle
li’o. . Rut socially tho nicrnge jcl'lcr
naior college coiupttrcs quite favor-
ably with Grlitncll. ‘

All this is admitted by many uiidciu

. graduates, the writer believes. and lie

. certain tltat the great body of alumni
graduated in the last few years holds
this opinion. Even faculty members
ltitve been known to crprcss a similar
il'lcw. it is certain that changes will
come eventually, hut why not NOW,
this yeari

The Scarlet and Block pointed out
in an able cditorinl that this is the
crucial time in Grinnell's history. The
college has recovered from the effects
of the war much more quickly than
the average institution. ‘The next few
years arc full of promise. But if
some change is not made in the
social policy, the type of student that
Grinnell wants will inevitably choose
one of the western colleges, which
it not quite equal to Grinnell in most
,ways, at least puts as much emphasis
on attractive social life as it does on
other undergraduate activities,

An excess of social life would he as
nndesirablc as the present lack of it.
‘lant there is no need of_ going to the
‘other extreme.

The club rooms of the men's rlorlnlr
tories would he admirable places for
informal dances on Friday or Saturday
’evenings. House moLhels could chap-

 

erone these parties, and they could be ‘

managed by the men of the buildings
‘at little ex ensc. Not only would they
be attractive social afiaii-s, but they
[would help to develop that much de-
‘sired thing called “house spirit,"

ii a dinner party is hold at the Wo-
_l\lel1’s Quadrangle there is no reason
,why it should be forced to spend an
evening at the movies when there is
’an attractive little dancing room in
‘Ceutral building. There is no reason
'u-hy the literary societies have to con-
'fine their social activities to joint
meeting, dinners and picnics. An
'occasional card party and dance might
vary what has become monotony to
many, And why should there be a
ban on dancing at Faculty teas?

Regulation of social affairs is need
cd of course. But an informal dance
