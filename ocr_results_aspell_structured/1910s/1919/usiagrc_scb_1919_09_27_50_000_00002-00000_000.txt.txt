when, with the necessary amount or
patience and cussing. you ﬁnally get
"15d", and there are never more than
and undisturhed conversation.

When conditions get to the point
that men have to install private phones
in their suites to insure any service at
all it is time something was done.
Ever since this attroeity was first
committed edllol‘els and communica-
tions have been written, protests have
been ninde by the student council, and
the men, collectircly and individually,
have pleaded and begged that some-
thing be done. But nothing ever has.

action is not only here but is almost
too’old to vote on. IT'S SOMEBDDY'S

Sonic people. tell us that there is no
such thing. Perhaps they' ~e right, but
we think that the matter 0 heing Cour»

Courtesy costs absolutely nothing
and its returns are enormous, Cam'—
tesy is a little thing in itseit hot it
has a rcinarhable significance. It is
so easy, in our daily lite in the doi-
mitoi-ics and quadrangle to iorget the
little reiinenieiits that stamp a gentle»
man or lady.

It is easy to torget to say "please"
or “thanh you" and the many little
phrases that are simply marhs ot re
spect. it is not hard to be polite, it
is simply a habit and is a. habit that
is \vorth forming.

College is supposed to develop roe

contest, of every pep meeting. A
hand can generate more pep and en-
thusiasih in a given tune than any
other known source.

The hand is a vital part of this

, college, and it is up to every one at
,ns to support it. It you can pl
any kind or a hand instrument it is
your duty to report for hand prac-
tice. It tahes more than enthusiasm
to make a band. it takes MEN who
are willing to devote some of their
time to this phase of college life.

And the rest of its can do our part

,toe, by supporting the hand in all
its activities. The least we can do is
to lend the hand our moral support.

Let's all hoost tor the hand, the
generator of all college spirituaud
the most enicient supporter of the
team. You owe it to the team as well
as to the hand.

was ever heard of. It never was any

and more aggravating than ever."

It you have never used this wonr

its advantages. It never takes more
than ﬁfteen minutes to get through to
