Moser's oration, entitled “Arm-tub

He showed how the United states is

governing that country than any other

Mr. Middleton could ﬁnd no place

Thursday evening's concert is a tub
utc not only to the hai-o-caiucd ability

melodic and dyn inic eitccts inherent
in each compos ion pi-ovod that the

on the part of these tour players to

Mr. Middleton’s program was ar-
