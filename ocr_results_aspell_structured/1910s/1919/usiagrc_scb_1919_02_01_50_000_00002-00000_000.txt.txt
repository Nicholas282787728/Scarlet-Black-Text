ol uny iiii-thci- noicl wailare on land,
he is once more taking up his pen
to let down the events oi college life,
as ucll as the opinions and more
whinis ol the student body in gen
ei-nl which are dnily playing their
small port in torniing the history of
the institution.

But we cannot pass to the new ordcr
Without mentioning the remarkable
worl: oi the retiring editors. Never
hetorc in her history has Grlunell been
compelled to lsce such at critical
period as has existed since the opening
ot college lost September, and never
before has the spirit tor which the
school is iamous been displayed to bet-
ter‘ddvahtage than in the work of
these editors. Assuming the oiiicc
with practically no experience in the
managing of a. poper, Miss St. John
and \i Noel have maintained the
place among the mid- western college
and university news papers which the
Scarlet and Black has long enjoyed.
To them and to their start or reporo
crs, composed largely or women, is
due 2. great deal oi credit for the high
standing which they have held,

Grmuell has been placed in a. new
light to the men returning from us.-
tionol service. Having been absent
tor a. seemingly long time, we are more
ﬁrmly convinced of her real wo th,
and are more determined than ever be-
torc to place her in her rightful push
tion among the colleges or the coun-
try.

The Scarlet and Black wul continue
its policy of being snewspnpcr. it
we can relate the events and incidents
oi our college hie, as well as when
student opinion in its brocdcr sense.
with Perhaps an occasional suggestion
which may he accepted or rciccted ac-
cording to the will ol the majority,
then we shall have lnlhllcd our place
in the lite of the college. As hits been
the case with the post mnncgcmcnt,
