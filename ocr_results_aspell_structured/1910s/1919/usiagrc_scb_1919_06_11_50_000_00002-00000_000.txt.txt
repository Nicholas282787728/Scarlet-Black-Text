War savings stamps have a particu-
lar inter est. lor college students. They
present a sate investment or the size
which is uiost likely to ﬁt the thin
pocket books

Al. present we have no immediate
use for “money in the bank." For this
reason the majority of us take pains
to see that o‘ur funds do not strike up
much of an acouaintauccship with the
deposit side of the ledger,

It is re easy to forget that some
day it is barely possible that “dad”
Won‘t be handy to answer a franticl
s. o. s with a lire saving cheeh orl

Uncle Sam drawing a good rate on
interest may prove a welcome friend
in such an emergency. l

More valuable than the actual
amount of money put into savings!
stamps is the habit of thritt whichl
they develop, Americans have always
prided themselves on. being "good
spenders.” Europeans have learned
the value of thrift In their own advan-
tage and our discomhture. l

Uncle Sam is still selling thritt‘
stamps. Buy some and get the habit. l
