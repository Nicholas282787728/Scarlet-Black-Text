Rare Chinese Flowers
In Botanical Gardens

Several Varieties ct Chinese plants
now fcini an interesting corner in the
Botanical Gardens and are growing
lust south or the toolahousc. These
are very unusual in American gni
dens, although some of the plants rc-
semble American var' ties.

A few at those now in bloom are
A garden balsam with red lloiver
viulluge vines; “Joseph's Goat," a l'edr
leafed plant; Chinese pumpkin; Kur
Qua. an ornamental vine; Tuthua,
a giant iiiiitcr melon, and two varieties
of Chinese beans.

The Botanical department is also in
receipt of a large illustrated book on
the Botany 01 Chum, the present or
Mr. Kuuk. The book is printed partly
in Chinese and paitly in English, and
is the only extensive literature on
Chinese flora available here.

PREP SUHUUL REAL
GRINNELL IN CHINA

College Is Also Asked to Help In
Institution of Higher
Learning.

In order to lll‘omote the unity of
interest and support at home and um
ity of action and viewpoint on the ﬁeld
it was decided to select a. certain 107

 

 

entity in China and to concentrate
Grluuell interest on that section. A
portion of Shantung province lying
about 'l'cchon and Tsinantu was sel—
ected. 1n the broadest sense then the
term GrihnelHIhClliha would include
the work cari d on by Grinnell pew
ple ‘in that region whether they be
teachers, ministers, doctors, nurses,
athletic directors, business men or
anything else. In this sense the re—
lation is rather indeﬁnite and is large-
ly a matter of sentiment
is Extension of G iuneil.

But the term Grinncll—in-China is
also applied to the preparatory schools
at Techou. it is to these institutions
that most 0 'pur support goes. Here
the connection is Very close. In ad—
"tion to tarnishing the personnel and
giving Lhe support, Grimell through
its committee representing faculty,
students and alumni, has a voice in
shaping the policies and planning the
work. In this sense Grinnell—in—China
is more than a place where we send
men and money. It is an extension
at Grinncll.

hi addition to these preparatoi
schools Grinnell has been invited to
share in the higher work of Shautung
Province. n union illler»dcn0mlmttion—
al institution with departments of liLl-
el'ltl arts, medicine and theology is
now under construction at Tsiuoufu,
the capital or Shantung, about eighty

miles from Teciiou. Under the present l
plan Grinuell is to provulc tin-cc lnr
structors in this institution. They are i
to he supported by an endowment of
$100,000. The American Board will
furnish ollerllalf at this of Grinncll
