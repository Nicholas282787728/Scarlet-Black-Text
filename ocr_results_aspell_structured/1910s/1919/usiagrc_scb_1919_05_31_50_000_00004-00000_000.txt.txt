Prof. Lavell Changes
N ame of Recent Book

“Reconstruction and National Life"
is the Litle of Prof. C, F. Liwell's new
book which has just came from the
press, The title was formerly given
out as "The Basis of Europe’s Racon-
Stl'llctiolli"

The summary of the book as stated
by the printers is as follows: "The
purpose of this book is primarily to
suggest and illustrate an historical
approach to the problem of recon-
struction in Europe. This problem is
not regarded as mainly the affair of
the Peace Congress or even of gov—

ernments as such, but as essentztllly
a matter or national adjustment. Pro-
fossor Lavell takes the ground that
each people must in the inniu work
’out its own snlvetion on lines deter—
mined by its own history, character
and attitude to liftkthilt from each
nations struggle toward freedomv ore
der and self-realization will cornc its
own reconstruction. This 'evolution
is studied in four countries, France.
Germany, Russia and Britain, and in
all or those reconstruction is viewer]
not as an external process, but. as the
expression or a dynamic notional life."
