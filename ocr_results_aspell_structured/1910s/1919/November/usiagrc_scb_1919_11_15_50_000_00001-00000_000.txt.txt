DUNSANY HOLDS ONE 01?
OLDEST IRISH TITLES

Has Gained International Fame as
Poet and 'Author in Period of
Eight Years.

Lord Dunsany, famous lrish 131a)“
wright and poet, author of "Tales of
War" and “The Gods of the Mountain."
will be heard at the Congregational
church Monday night under the aus-
pioes of the College Lecture course.
He will lecture on "My Own Country,"
embodying also some or his experi-
ences in the Great War.

"At the beginning of the war, Lord
Dunsany was Captain in the Fifth
Royal Innskilling Fusiliers. Until he
was wounded in the Dublin riots he
was stationed in Londonderry drilling
recruits; then, before leaving tor the
trout in December, 1916, he was, for
a time, in barracks recovering from
his wound.

Plays Successful.

As a playwright and poet, Lord Dun-
sany has an international reputation
than can hardly be excelled. His dra-
matlc career covers a period of only
eight years, but he has proved that
those eight years have come to a most
wonderful fruition. The stage presen—
tations of the Dunsany plays have
met with growing favor, the most suc-
cessful of which have been "The Gods

- or the Mountain," “King Arglmiues,”

“The Golden Doom," "A Night at An
Inn," “The Lost Silk Hat," and "The
Queen’s Enemies," which were most
successfully produced by Stuart
Walker in his Portmanteau theate

‘."l‘he Gods of the Mountain" will be
remembered as the one—act play given
here by the Portmanteau players two
Years ago.

Deals With Fairyland.

Critics say that ”Lord Dunsany’s
poetry builds the more mysterious
kingdoms, where geography ends and
fairyland begins, with gods and heroes
at war, and the sirens singing still.
In a land oi nowhere, in a timeless
age, around the gods 0! his own cre—
ation has the dramatist woven his
plays. His "own country” is an imag-

lnary Country with the inhabitants [lab l

terncd alter his own ideals. The ele-
ment of surprise and his intense eager-
ness are Dunsauy's chief delights.

Besides being an author. Lord Dun-
sany is one of the oldest titles in Ire-
land and Great Britain, for he is the
eighteenth holder of the baronetcy
created in 1439. Lady Duusahy. the
daughter at Lord Jersey, has accompa-
nied him to this country.

Teachers’ Convention
Honors Grinnell Men

At the recent: session of the Iowa

was elected to bend the Iowa. Associa-
tion of Mathematics Teachers tor the
cooling year. Prof. Griffith was also
honored its leader of The English
Round Table for 1920.

tussuu STUDENTS
HEAWULUTIUN

Colleges Center of Bolshevism,
Said Ter-Michiaclian, Ar.
menian Student.

"There is a very great difference
between the student life in Grinnell
and that of the Russian universities.
declared Sarkis Ter»Michiaelian, Gr n-
nell’s new Armenian student, in des»
cribing his experiences in the Land of
the Czars.

Preceding the Revolution the stu-
.dent in Russia was the agitator for a
better order of things; he was the her-
laid of the Revolution itself. The great
mass of the people are ignorant and
can be reached only by the spoken
word, so the student went about tell-
ing them of a new day."

"After the wretched political situar
tion and the propaganda itself had pre—
cipitated the outbreak in 1915 disCCn~
tent seized the universities," Sar-kis
went on to say. Small bands began
to gather here and there to try to dis—
cover what they really thought about
the events which were happening with
such rapidity. To their astonishment
no two students held the same opin-
ions.

Universities Storm Centers.

"Universities became the storm cen»
ter of the early days of Bolshevism.
Practically all the Jews favored a
,radical break from the old regime
which gave them a chance to stretch
ltheir limbs that were so cramped from
Ioppress‘ion. Up until this time gov-
lernment agenés were at work on the
‘campus, reposﬁng all those who op-
‘posed the Czar.”

Sarkis thinks Grinnell is a dandy

 

mines, and he is especially interested

‘in the Scarlet and Black. In the
,“gymnasium” or secondary school at
his home in Tiflis, Russia, where he
went for eight years, groups of stur
dents published little papers which up-
heldlthe ideals and hopes oi Armenia.
They were carefully circulated to
avoid conflict with the Russian govern-
:ment. The University or Warsaw.
iwhel'e he studied medicine in 191s, had
:51 large publication but it was con-
‘cerned chiefly with political news and
paid but slight attention to student ac-
tivities.

‘ Dunsany Really Quite

A Human u IS Expert
Marksman.

Altho a leader in the literary world
Lord Dunsany must not be thought of
as a purely literary man. He is in
reality quite the opposite. Ai heart
Lord Duuseuy is a Quiet, home loving
man who spends most of his time at
his beautiiul country estate where he
gives his attention to his hobby,
marksmanship, He is an expert shot
with a revolver—in fact he is consid»
ered the beat in all England and Ira-
land. in connection with this excels
lency be is very fond ot hunting. When
at home his time is divided; he spends
the day hunting and the evening read»
ll’lK.

Something oi the true character of
|the man may he gained from the fol—
Ilowing extract from one of Lord Dun-
Isnuy's letters:

“We used always to waste the ﬁrst
man of the summer in London and
then come home and play cricket and
talk rabbits with a small rifle; then,
about September, go on a visit to Scot-
:llmd Cr Verbs-hire, dcel‘~slalking or
shooting grouse; their home again7
to spend the winter fax-hunting."

MAY PETERSON SINGS
Tl] LARliAUDIENBE

Dramatic Sense and Spiﬁt Add to
the Completeness of
/ Her Work,

"I‘M WEARIN’ AWA‘ JEAN”
’ FAVORITE OI" AUDIENCE

Miss May Peterson, “The Golden
Girl of the Metropolitan," charmed
the audience, which illled Herrick
chapel last night.

Miss Peterson combines a voice of
unusual beauty and ﬂexibility, with a
charming personality. She won her
audience immediately.. Her hue dra—
matic sense, her ability to throw her-
self wholly into the spirit of her songs,
her facial expression, all added to
the completeness of her work.

“I’m wearin' awa', Jean," which
seemed to be the favorite of the and
ence, displayed the rich smooth duality
oi her voice, and a splendid breath
control. The appearance of a music~
loving member of Gl‘innell’s feline
menagerie detracted somewhat from
the effect of "Allelujah" of Mozart,
which was sung with an appreciation
of the varying emotions.

Miss Peterson was generous with
her encores, giving seven in all, in
response to the demands of her eager
audience. She played her own accoln~
paniment to "The Little Irish Cal"
and “Dawn.”

Mr. Gordon Campbell played
accompaniments.
