The hardest game of the season with,
the Coe College eleven last Saturday
left the Cornell team badly shattered,
and confronted Coach Finger with the
possibility of having to make a. whole-

four men will probably still be on the

“If the king of Siam visits the

hyanahdlt, a student from Siam. in a
recent intelwicw.

Sudha explmned that it has been,
thought for some time that King;
Vajil‘avudh planned to visit Europe:
and America but on account of the
death 0! his mother last month, he
will postpone this proposed trip for
sometime.

Kt will be remembered that Siam is
one 0! the feW remaining countries
which are ruled by absolute monr
archs.

Sudha spoke of King Vajurvudh as
a Well-educated, broad-minded mon—
arch, who always has the welfare of
Siam at heart. His brother, M.
Longkla, is at present studying sani-
tary engineering in Massachusetts.

This is only a part of the king‘s '

plans whereby good may he obmined
from other countries, according to
Sudha. A number of Siamese stu-
dents ltre sent to each of the larger
European countries and to the United
suites each year in order that they
may study peculiarities of these coun—
tries. Most of these students are
sent to England (King Vajirzwudh i
himself a graduate of Oxford).

By this method of education Siam

and use this knowledge to advance

“Art is any work that is supremely

Speaking with reference to the War,

mage. wul'tmer is still bothered with
his knee, but is out running signals
and may get into scrimmage before
the end of the week. He Will be back
at his old job at the pivoml position
Saturday, in all probability. Slnalley,
who was kept out of the Geo con-
test, is again at the light Wing posi-
tloh.
Leiuloy Lacks Credits.

Lemley, who has been playing a
regular guard, has not been out in
suit since the cue game, and prob-
ably will not appear against Cornell.
Scholastic impediments seem to be

are that he will be unable to remove
the "coll” before Saturday. Knles,
who played a. whale of a game at
center against One, is being used at
Lelnley's guard, and no doubt will
