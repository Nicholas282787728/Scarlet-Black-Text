Do You Think
Mother Grinucll will be
glad to see her children.
Grilulell is the spring ol‘
Fouﬂl.

The recreation hour wns‘n
success.

Thanksgiving time draws near and
brings with it thoughts or home and
mother with roast turkey and pumbe
kin pie in the foreground of the men»
tail picture.

The homecomings oi Thanksgiving
value than can be
sherbet and

have a greater
reckoned in terms of

cranberry sauce.

A loyalty to the family gives a re
in a fl‘esheued and strengthened
purpose gained irom contact with the
spring from ivhich the original forces
of life have sprung.
A college is the intellectual and
spiritual mother of her students.

The Freshman brings to the halls of
learning a plastic mind ready to be
molded. As a senior he leaves them
with his mind stored and his mental
attitudes ﬁ 'ed.

\ Alumni who return for homecoming
will be able to recognize the results
of their trip when they return to their
wo Having broken thru the con—
nning sordid boundaries of everyday
life and gotten once more a clear view
of the ideals with which they went
forth into the world he cannot help re-
turning to his life station with a pori-
iied and strengthened purpose

The turkey and pumpkin pie are
also promised and in even greater
quantity than formerly. Football
cake served hot from the gridiron with
Dramatic Club sauce will he a feature
or the menu.

~——~a— _

It you are an Alumni and are gets
ting old, or think you are, come back
[O'Grmnell and take a..plullge in the
spring of eternal youth.

The success of the ﬁrst recreational
hour held lasi Saturday proves the
popularity of this new experiment of
social life.

It’s informality served to bring the
quadrangle and dormitory groups to—
gether in a way which has long been
desired and never realized,

In its first trial under ﬁre dancing
has proven itself worthy.

Let those who doubt attend the next
recreational hour,

_.__._a_........

The committees in charge of home—
coming are urging that alumni mix
with the college students in order that
they may discover that the college has
not changed.

l. The committees are wise in asking
the alumni to look beneath the sur—
face. New campus buildings and dif—
ferent standards of the superﬁcial
campus life may lead the unobserving
to condemn the present Grinnell as
different from the institution which

they attended. ‘

Inasmuch as the world advances

and thcieioie changes Glllmcll has
kept price.
dn lllulllllus need only look below,
these suriacc changes to ﬁnd the same
eariicst Gl'ilmell Spu‘ll. which has lullr

Grinncll-coinell game from whitl. our

the Scarlet and Black. The psychology

by large scores
the season iuto
tcain which was

all but one game of
a lighting, winning
able to triumph over
Jinx and dupe.
' Conditions are not so hopeless for
Saturday’s game as may were in 1914
but stlll the outcome is far from car»
talnl

Eight hundred meters at [he pep
mecting Friday night and eight hull—
dl'ed luvlllclhles at the game can make
the outcome certain.

it has been done belorc. it can be

done again.

l WHAT no You THINK? i

As long as there is a Griunell, and
as long as there is n Quadrangle, we
will probably always have those fowl
women who take out their spite by;
l
below hiears and Central cottages. li!
those who do it would put their clever—
ness to more constructive thoughts,:

throwing Witter down on 01056 passing

their efforts would be more appl‘ecv
tried, and if the stunt were a new one,
the men would surely take it as ajolie,
but alter the ﬁrst few years a “joke"
gets rather old, and an new one is quite
in order.

As it happens those who threw the
water Tuesday night caught two VlSiv
tors from our neighboring university
to the east, and the impression of
Grinnell and the Grinnell women,
which they carried home with them,
can be judged from that fact that be-
ing visitors they carried no extensive
wardrobe, and had (a go home drench-
ed. s or course the men made excuses,
out what excuses they were!

Miss—Bum:

 

Personal Impressions of Lord Dunsany

Iu speaking of Lord Dunszllly in 2“]
interview [his morning. Professor
Liwcll said:

“Ill the ﬁrst place, Lord Dlmsal'ly is
a most human, agreeable person. i
have met plenty of people in America
who were snobs because of money.
because of social position in their
village 01' town, or because of descent
from the dyflmvel; lull. Dimsany.
lord of a Twelfth century castle, of
5,000 acres in Menth, a baron who
traces his descent far beyond the age
of Columbus, is less of a snob than the
President of many a soueedunk Woe
man’s Club We could have invited
him to a wienie picnic down by Al'hol‘
Lake knowing that he would have out
switches and helped with the ﬁre as
wholeheartedly: as any of us. Neither
is he swelled as to his head in regard
to his literary eminence. He lifts a
naive pride in his work and makes no
bones of the fact that he is all artisL
and a poet. But it is as nilLlll'Ltl and
inoffensive a pride (lsl our [wide when
we boast of our Tomatoes or lettuce
hlLel' good work in our gardens.

I told him about Bicl‘staflt's remark
that he was rather 3t proud and
llztugllty pel'soll, Very conscious that he
was the 18th baron Dullsally, and he
explained “2|th by saying that Blar-
stzttlt had never seen him. The states
meut obviously amused him, and of
coulse it is not tl'ile,'as allyoue would
know who talked to him [or ﬁve min?
utes,

He did remark, however, that. lie was
conscious of being the Km Enroll in
one regard, that'if he yids the 13th
oi his line it was high time that the
Barons Dunsftlly justiﬁed their exist-
once by doing something wol’th While
instead of living on their estates and
httving it good time. TVhen it was
suggested that the older Barons bad
after all done something he admitted
that his comment must not be [alien
loo literally, for his forefathers had
done their share of ﬁghting and hztd
taken a part in every war for the last
four hundred years and more. not he
appeared to think that modem condi-
tions [Equil‘ed something more. Alto-
Eether his rank and descent seemed to

 

be rcgardcd as imposing a responsi—
bility, not as giving him the right to
look down on the common world from
a suncrcilious height."

There is another thing. The manu-
script from which he read on Monday
evening was beautifully written (with
8. quill) without a single re‘vision or
cream It was both the ﬁrst and the
last writing of it, He is one of the
few writers who can express himself
with immediate and spontaucous per-
fection 01' form. He never rewrites
or corrects When his idea gets to the
point of white heat in his head it

comes out in just the right Words, .

rhythmic, clear, felicitous, with not
the slightest sign of crudity, (llflllse-
ncss or obscurity, which are of course
the signs of carelessne, and hasty
work. it sounds miraculous, hot it is
a fact.

Also the manuscript contains won-
derfully effective illustrations in color,
his own work, put in for the guidance
of the stage manager. They are care—

less as to drawing, but they are won-

derfully oliective in color and design.
The picture or the king on his golden
throne. the embodiment of regal bride,
and of the two prostrate acolytes, was
a joy to behold.

Finally, he has a thoroughly alive
and unafectetl interest in what he
sees. He took obvious interest in the

bilildillgs,'-iu the campus, in Profes— .

sor Spencer's collection of stones, in
the sliclf oi new books in the library,
in the iowa soil, and in the sunset
over the pl'ttirie.‘ President Mains
car was put at his disposal tor the aft—
011100“, and accompanied by several
menibc’rs of the faculty, he saw some-
thing ef the town, the surrounding
country, and the college, stopping for
half an hour at the Quad for tea with
Miss Read and Mrs. Kline. He was
apparently not bored tor a minute, and
he talked not at all of himself, his
castle, his rank or his literary achieve—
ments, but always of what he was see—
ing or of things other people talk
about—politics, spiritualism, the fu—
ture of Europe, or the excellence of
the jam‘tliat he had on his bread at
the Quad.
