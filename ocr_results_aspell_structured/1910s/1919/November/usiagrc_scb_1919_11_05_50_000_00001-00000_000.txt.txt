“Not any of you knows a thing about

light shade of mourning since Hal—
lowe'en night. The board walk is no
more! A group of loyal t?) Grinnel-
bans, unable to restrain their enthusi—
ziSrn over the Pioneers, the night, and
the walk, banded together in the noble
cause, and, working with a will, soon
ended the career or an ancient instituv ,
ticn. Many were attracted to the
scene by the noise of the endeavor,
but most of the deed was done and
the planks were burning merrily

The townspeople, together with
‘lnany Dorm and Quadites, were fully
convinced that the old Griuncll has
returned and that, contrary to com-
mon opinion, Ghosts, Jack-o'—Lanterns
sud bonﬁres have not yet passed from
the student program.

The walk, like all traditions, died
hard. However, by the time the last
plank crumbled, Grinnell‘s new silic-
wslk was fast becoming an actuality
and the fans were recompcuscd.
