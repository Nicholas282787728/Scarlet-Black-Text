A MEN’S COLLEGE FOR MEN.

G r i n n e l l is distinctive among

institutions of higher learning because
of her ideal of a college for men to-
gether with a College for women.

For the past ten years, according to
Pr idem. Main, the college adminis~
tration has been striving toward this
goal. Points of Contact between the
men and the women of the college
which would render either group de~
pendent upun the other have been re-
moved as they have made themselves
evident.

The women were given a natural
unity in the Quadrangle ill order that
they might develop a unified Social
life.
ed the men ill the dormitories.

Thcse steps'have already been (alien
and it is now time for another which,
though less extensive, is none the less

The same advantage was grant-

rnal tn the acooniplisliuioiit of the (197
- red goal.

in each group ot buildings as the
president says "tlleic is natur
unlit oi nil in residence," . t the same
,time there still remains a (creed rele-
‘tioiiship between the two through the
coiiecntrntiou oi dining mom and
kitchen management u ii d or Quail-
i-aiigle supc ion.

The dependency of the men on
Quadrangle authority through this
arrangement is the only apparent ob-
stacle iu the lcalizatlun oi a college
tor lnen alone which implies fulidar
mentally that it he by men alone.

i The. present system of combined
{management (‘ntalls a constant inter»
.[cl’ence with the lite oi the men at
:nlany points.

i The men oi the college are justiﬁed
in asking that this obstacle be re-
moved and that they be given the
chance of developing uuhampered
their own» group lite.

Now is the logical time to remedy
the fault. The present dining room
and kitchen management is dudihg
that the task or caring tor both places
is too great a burden for it to bear
comtoi-tably. The whole question of
iced has been opened by the student
council and a. lasting solution should
be adopted.

We suggest a complete sepaiatiou
of the quadrangle and dormitories in
matters of management as such a
solution.

The story of the lost Indian and the
Union Paciﬁc railroad holds a lesson
for the present age.

Sci-oral rcais rotor-c the ﬁrst iron
horse had completed the trill frolu AL-
lnntic to Paciﬁc an Indian of a far
western tribe was ﬁlled with the de—
sire to cross the mountains which had
always shut in on the West and see
what lay beyond, '

Shouldering his pack he started out
toward the coveted goal. But once
the loothills were past he found him-
self confrontcd with a jumble of toW‘
cring rocky peaks whose precipitous
sides appcared to otter an insurmount-
able barrier to his progress.

Directly before him a perilous trail
wound upward to the heights. At one
side a smoother path led into a yawn
ing valley. He chose the latter.

Years later the engineers oi the
Union Paciﬁc railroad Came to the
same spot and were conironted Wlth
the same problem. They chose to sur-
mount the seemingly insurmountable
and alter prodigious eitort succeeded,

“men they had penetrated several
miles into the mountain {astness they
came upon an aged Indian living alone
in a rockrwallcd valley.

Eventually the engineers reached
the sunny slopes or California While
the Indian died in the Valley trap.

The sunny slopes are [or those who
drive a trunk line through whatever
obstacles may be in the Way. The
mountain desolation ot ideals im-
realized will fall to those who take
the line of least resistance.

“'3 venture the statement that the
mountain desolation Will be thickly
populated and that those who reach
the sunny slopes will die of loneliness.
We base our statement on an observa-
tion of college students.
