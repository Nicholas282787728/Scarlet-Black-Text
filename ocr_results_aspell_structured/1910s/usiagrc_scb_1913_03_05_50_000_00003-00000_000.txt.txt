THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. THE TERM
“Dry Cleaning ”

IS OFTEN MIS-CONSTRUED.

Many believe “Dry Cleaning" to imply the mere removal of
individual spots by local treatment, and int‘ltcd this belief has been
glvzn birth by hundrsds of lint-using clubs," “clothes pisssers." tzilor
shops. cm. whas: most valuable asset is 2 sign on the front door. mis
stating that "Dry Cleaning" is don: within.

It may be a surpris: to many that a well equipped “my Cleaning"’
plant olten removss as much as a small teacup lull of dirt and
grease lrom a single suit of clothes. So thorough a cleaning (as can
only be given by one having the equipment necessary) is absolute
insurance against spots reappearing and ample assurance of your
clothes having been thoroughly disinfected.
