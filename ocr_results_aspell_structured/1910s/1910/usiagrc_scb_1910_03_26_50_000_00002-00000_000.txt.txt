NUMBER .98

The editorial column of this issue of
the Scarlet alld Black is given over-
to some suggestions that have apnea
ed in some oi the Freshmen editorials
that were recently prepared [or one
of the classes. They are especially
suggestive ilr one respect and that ls
the interest which the Freshmen, ill
common with many other students in
the college are taking in the student
llie oi the institution, While this
interest may create some little uni-est
for the time being it will ultimately
result in a in more wholesome college
life. than is possible at the present
lime.

An active, intelligent interest in the
conditions at college life is a certain
and efiective means of training for a
larger citizenship when the student
leaves the college compus.

NATIONAL AFFAIRS.

Oberlin has a custom which lnigirt
well he brought to Grinneli. There
every loul‘ years, at the time of the
national political conventions, the stu-
dents hold a lnimic convention with all
the workings of the original, There
are the temporary chairman, hernia
nsnt chairman, national committee.
and delegates representing cvsry sec-
'tion oi tile country. The convention
develops parlimcntarians much octc
ter- than any other college institution.
it develops an inter ill politics and
all national airail and nmlies rloszsi»
ble a straw vote, aluays all intcroso

THE 0L. Pv‘Ul‘IJI.‘ m.

Among the many drilerollt p is
of college liic, thorc is out» or gr _
value and illlporhlucc, wllicll ls, llOl'Cl'
iilclcss, probably the least lctogll . 1;
namely, ill class prayer meeting.

A little Liwilgiliiui colisliieliition \Viil
readily reveal its llllpoltuutc: in fact.
its value can scarcely lie overestimated
The lncmhcrs or a class gathering hy
themselves ror a short religious r-
vice once a week, lcuds a tone to the
whole college lirc whicll is not follrrd
elsewhere. it supplies the missing
link, so to speak; it gathers no the tim-
gled meshes and ravclled cllds of a
week’s work and llrings all into a srir
gle, uniﬁed whole.

Here in the class pl‘aycl'mcetilig, the
students meet each other us they
really are, nothing feigned, nothing
pretended. Each comes illto closer
touch and more intimate relation with
his fellows sod ﬁnds in them a l'eadl'
welcome for his irlcnlship. Here are
always found those who are most in
terested in the welfare of the class, as
in chapel are always found those who
are most concerned tor the lvclfsre oi
the school. Hence we ﬁnd that in
the class prayer meeting lies the nu-
cleus oi clsss spirit, and since class
spirit goes to make up college spirit
and it is the spirit of a school that
“does things,” the class prayer meet-
ing, their, is certainly of a value greats
ly underestimated in the present day.

THE INTERVIEW]-

“One or the iron. us is that, oiieli
the speaker does not tail: loudly
enough so that lie in the rear of the
Ilulldilrg can hear- him," said one oi
the Freshmen recently. Sometimes,
as in the case of several or the recent
talks, the leader did not speak distinct
ly and the joke or pun “as lost to us
while the others enjoyed it.

“Occasionally the lecturer addresses
his remarks to the Seniors on the
front rows and we feel ‘ieit out‘ and
consequently uninterested. Under
these conditions it is rather difficult
to sit quietly and to listen with hilt
pretended interest and this, I think, no
counts for our rather ungentlemaniy
