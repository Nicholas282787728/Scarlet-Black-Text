ArrREcIATION.
Professor Steiner called attention in

the Tuesday chapel Sel‘VlCe to one ot
the simplest and most practical ideals
Rlisk‘ i's

of life when he suggested
statement to be able to appreciate we

thily and "to be worthy oi apprecia-

tion.“ as the one great thing to be (187
sired in life. The more one thinks
about this the more comprehensive it
becomes. If [our years in Grinnell will
have helped the men and women at the
college to this ideal, those (our years
will have been well spent

BASKETBALL.

It is becoming a generally recogiii.

tact that unless something is done to

‘ change the character of college basket.
ball as it is played today the game is
doomed. Two nights ago the tuo lead»
iiig teams in the state met for tiie has
netball title. Those who saw the
pitched battle say- that it was ilntlmlhlr
edly tar rougher than ioothall. The
personal shock in the game is just as
great and the protection ailordcti the
basketball player is less than that re-
eeived hr the roothali inan, Two men
were ruled out oi the game riular tor
slugging. How times did that
occur on any oi the college gridiroiis
in Iowa last fall?

And yet uractiralli all that is iloorlml
to correct the present game is to lil'c

’lne tact that the rcieree asseits him-

the rules. There are two leatlil‘es
under the iiitul’collegiiite rules which
tend to make the game rougher than
under the Y. M. C. A. rules, the (Ir )ble
and the rule regarding the nosstl '

at the ball when it goes outside.

from these two features the llifcl‘vcolle.
giate rules are stricter and permit of {I
more scientiﬁc game of basket ball
than is possible under the other rules,
provided ol course ofﬁcials campcl the
players to play basketball.
