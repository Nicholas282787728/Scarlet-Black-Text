Black has scoured a rather comllluio
summary or the talk:

Although some kind of study ocr‘ur
pies a large part of the lite of evcrv

some, vcrv few persons can tell how
to study, and pr: :llr no one is
dciinilcly taught km to go at the

volumes have ever been written on

He formulates the processes of stillll
in eight points, cach of which is club,
orated in a chapter of his book. The
points are:

1. The lindiug of sucrilic purpose
tor the study, or knowing what kind
of mini-motion you are looking for,

2. Supplementing the text by in
tcrpretations and illustrations from
your own thought,

3. The orgalliy iioil of the iacts ctllr

for School of Music.

The trustees or Grinnell college took
an absolutely imperative step when at
the mldwlntcr meeting, held yes»
lerday, they raised the tuition from
$55 to $70 a year. The change was
lust of all due to general economic
conditions. As conditions are now, $70
does not mean as much as 555 did a
low years ago. The college obeyed the
unwritten rule, followed by practically
all colleges, that thc amount of thc tui-
lion shall be equal to halt tnc cost of
sending the student through the col-
lege. The average cost of a student to
the college per year is slid. Ilcncc
:he tuition is made $70,

The step was when by the trustees
only after careful investigation had rv

The committee in charge were
instructed to secure more definite
preliminary plans for a bulding for
the School of Music and also to confer

1n the earliest colleges the greatest
