A Vt’slcd Chair.

The chapel scrrir is already out: ol
the host things “'0 lml'C in Grlliiiell.
But there is one thing thnt would add
greatly to the attractiveness ol’ Illis
beautiful s 'ce mid that is it r ted
choir. Last year the thoir C\'D\'K‘s:cil
a willingness to wear the \CStilICntS
but did not tool llir' should go to the
expense of prottdi g them. This is
a duty that the college council might
very properly loot; alter. Some sort
or an arrangement might he made
whereby the students could turn
part or the neressar, l‘und while the
college liiorided the rest, This much
is certain, no greater single improve
ment could be made in the resper so '
ice than to have a choir in restnients
A vested choir would give a dignity
and beauty to the service in keeping
with the sp -it of the horn.

One of the recent graduates at the
college, a man who has no professional
interest in music “lotc: "What
wouldn't i give to hear some oi the
Vesper music now, I didn't real e
in college how much I would miss it
when 1 lelt." This suggests the
thought that there are many who do
not alall tlieliiscll'es or this opportu-

My Dear Mr. Somers:

My severe illness since the ﬁrst or
the year has made it impossible loi- inc
to thank my friends at Gi'innell, thru
you, tor all their kindness to me. To-
day I am able to write a few lines and
in them I wish to say “Thank you”
from my heart.

It has been a hard battle, but it is
almost ﬁnished, and tho 1 haro nercr
feared on its outcome, yet 1 can heart-
ily say that I’m glad it’s orcr with.

A few more weeks or rest and quiet
and I hope to take my place in the
ranks, fighting the battles oi lite.

I shall not try to come back to
school this year hecztusc I do not think
