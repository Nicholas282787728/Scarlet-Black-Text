WISCONSIN'S EXAMPLE.

In another column or the paper Kips
pears a statement of the recent ruling
of the Board or Health of Wisconsin,
By that act all puhlic drinking cups
are done away with. So far the state
hoard of health at Iowa has not taken
such drastic artion. This is, however,
not an indication that there might not
be a need for such action.

A FRIEND.

Grinnell college has lost a friend in
the death or Dr. E. W. Clark wllo has
had very real interest in the college
tor a good many years It was his
privilege to be connected with the (2017
1356 in an olficial capacity as it passed
thi-u some of the vital periods of i .
history. It is our pi 'ilege in paying
tribute to his memory to hear in mind
the part he played n the development
of the college during the past years.

CRITICISM,

There can not he too much or the
right sort of criticism and that iiii
vidual or institution which resents a
discussion of the various ieaturcs more
or loss vital to its e cute can lliirrll}
hold a tenable position. There is, haw»
ever, another iorm oi criticism which
is unworthy or a college man or war
man. For a carel’ul coiuprehcnsi
