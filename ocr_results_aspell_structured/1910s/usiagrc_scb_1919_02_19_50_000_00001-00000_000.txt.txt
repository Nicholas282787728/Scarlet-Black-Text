nell now has two victories and onc dc
feat. marked down in the percentage

column of the Missoun Valley Confer-
elice.

Grimm]! In Fourth Place.

Amos is in sixth place in conference
standing while Grinncll is two notches
higher. However, Aines has played
more than twice as many conferencc
games as the locals, having played
seven conference games while the
Scarlet ﬁve has played only three. The
farmers have also lost to Iowa. and
Simpson but no dope can be obtained
from either of these two games since
Grinnell has not met either team.

It is probable that Coach Hatter
Walter will start the same ﬁve men
against Grinncll whom he started
against Iowa last Saturday. “flute and
Miller at forward, seems to he the best
lineup that the Ames coach has round
so far this season. In the IolyarAnles
game each Ames man counted at least
once from the ﬁeld with the exception
of Bob Miller. Shepard tossed three
out of four chances from the foul line.
His accuracy. in foul-throwing may be
a big factor in the Ames score Sature
day.

Slime Lineup to SW‘

The same line-up will start the game
for Grinnell as was used at the be-
ginning of the Teachers game last
week. Crane and Hammond at for-
ward, De Ruytel' at’ center. with Win»
ter and Lion as guards was the coin:
binationwhich began the game with
the pedagogs. ‘

The Scarlet ﬁve has won three
games and lost two while Allies has
lost more games than they have won.
11 Griunell wins the victory it will give
the Scarlet ﬁve a better hold on fourth
place with a chance for third if Miss
sonri loses this weekend.

Baroness Says Germans Are Same

"The thing I most fear,” said Mule.

to a Scarlet and Black reporter, "Is
that the Americans will forgive the
Germans too easily. They are as [the
sequlous now, as halo c, they were are
rogant. Take the varnish off, and they
are all alike."

She said that one of the causes that
spurred the French on to victory was
to see long lines oi refugees fleeing
from their homes, passing die soldicrs
who were going to thc front. There
would be-a line of refugees on one
side of the road, and a line of soldiers
going in the opposite direction, on the
other side. Many of these iciugccs,
she added, wont to Algeria, \vhel'c
