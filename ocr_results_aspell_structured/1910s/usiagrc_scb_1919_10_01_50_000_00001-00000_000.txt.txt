WORLD WAITING FOR
LEADERSHIP-STEINER

Intellectuals Not To Be Sneered
At Says Prof. A. E. Steiner
In Vespers Address.

THREE WAYS TO RESTORE
NEW ORDER ARE POSSIBLE

"Millions of toilcr-s are straining
their cars to hear the new Hosanna,
and the wise men are wandering thru
the deserts ol doubt and criticism in
search of the new born king who is to
make over the world," said Dr. A. E
Steiner at Vespers Sunday. ”Newspa»
[leis may sneer at the intellectuals
such as Anatole France, H. G. Wells,
Thomas Hardy- and others, but since
the barrage of propaganda has quieted
down, socially-minded urou crcr
whore are ﬁlled with profound disgust
and weariness.

“Our institutions are intlccay.
Christ (lied after a brief tbirtymne
years, Ioaving a following small in
numbers, but signiﬁcant in power, Ar.
ter two thousand years, He has count-
less pr-orcsscd follower-s, but their-
power, ll not insigniﬁcant is negli-
gible. Spirllnal counsel was provided
for our boys at Verdun but it was not
-allowcd at peace table in Versailles,
\vbcrcitw mor-cncedcd. But more
and more, the fears, hopes, doubts, and
beliels of the pcoplc are beginning to
be universal."

New Order Sought.

There are three u , , thF-ouglr which
(be new order may be sought. First,
it may he sought thru legislaliou. Legv
islatioll was once trusted, and the law
was considered acurb for the unscrunr
nlous. But it is regrettably true that
the unscrupulous have acted as a curb
on the low.

“Tile second War is turn anarchy,
but the anarchist is doubtless wrong.
There can he no progress without ore
dor. But order is not progress, There
1’ beautilul order in a cemetery, but
‘llrrc is no progl‘c's.“

"The third way is lbru religion, and
thru it alone can new men he created.
At best, religion is s. way of life, at
worst, a way out at life. Only as men
live by the rules of Christ will we have
1' ice and progress. '

oi enduring persecution for the sake
of ils ideals. We are not willing to
pay the price. We, have expected the
row world to come without any
trouble, either thru a sudden miracle
of God, or thru evolution.”

“This day is one for which the, world
has been waiting, and now a new call
has come. Let us enlist under the
banner of Jesus and become His apos-
ties,"

Faith in Lawlessness
Is Unpardonable Sin

“The one nunardouable mental sin
is to have faith in lawlessness,” de-
clared Frof. C. E. Lavell in chapel
Monday morning. "It has never been
more difficult to preserve mental sim-
ity and perspective than now, and there
never was such a need to do so,

“We can not solve the problems of
the world by ignoring the {acts and
quoting ’God's in his heaven, all's right
with the world.’ The innocent do sub
for in reality. It is necessary to turn
to the ideal as expresscd in ﬁction, not
only for rest, but because the right is
fundamental."

COMMUNITY HOSPITAL TO
CARE FOR SERVICE MEN

Another important commission has
l’ust been accepted by the Community
Hospital. Official announcement is
made that the hospital maudgemcnt
has just signed a contract with the
War Risk Insurance Department at
the Public Health Service Bureau to
take care of any soldiers, sailors, mare
incs and nurses from this vicinity
who may need hospital attention.

"Everyone trusts,” said Dr. P. E.
Somcrs, “that there may not be much
need of such Service, but this is in
harmony with one or the actuating
purposes of the Hospital organization
and is an important feature in the
[Iublic service side of the hospital
functions."

departments to take over the work or
men. L. A. follor several months of
negotiation. No libraries were main-

great success of the work under the

Poles Deserve Our
Support—Prof. Peck

“The Poles need and deserve our
sympathy,” said Pl'ol‘. P. F. Fcck at
chapel Tuesday morning. "Poland
looks to America as a land of common
ideals, Poland is a new, and yct one
of the Dldast of nations. In the Fif-
teenth and sixteenth centurres she oc~
cupicd at territory larger than France,
and the partition of Poland stands out
as the greatest wrong of the Eighteenth
century. Through all these years
she has preserved llel' racial sense re~
markably Well, and Poland today is
one of the most interesting of the
newly-establi bed govcrnlnents.”

SALVI THE WORLD FAMOUS
HARPIST APPEARS FRIDAY

When Only a. Child—Is

imuons harp virtuoso, will open the

who had been booked for the ﬁrst rc-
cltal. Illness forced Miss Peterson
to postpone her Grinnell appearance
until late in November.
Only Twenty iii-o rears old.

Signor Salvi, although but twenty—'
ﬁve years of age, has already held two
calltineuls spellbound by his mar-vole
ons genius. He has been a sensauon
which it is given to only a chosen few
in all history to be. When but a
mere child he was playing for the-
hoyal Italian Court and since then he
has held the enviable positions or
lrarpist for the orchestras of Milan,
Paris, Naples, Venice and Florence,

He was “little short or a scnastion”
in his recent concert in Orchestra
Hall in Chicago, according to Herman
Davies writing for the Chicago Ameri—
can. “Salvi is a personality in the
music World; be has revolutionized
the art of harp playing. The volume
of his tone is ample enough for four
har-pists instead of one and yet his
pianissimo is ethereal," continues the
same critic. Alter his appearance in
Des Moines, Cortesi in the Des Moines
Register said of him: “His perform»
once was the most remarkable demon—
stration of the possibilities of the harp
ever given in this city."

Is Also a Composer.

Salvi's genius also extends into the
ﬁeld of composition, Over four hun-
dred works embracing operas. sym-
phonies. concertos for his own instru-
mcnt and var us lighter forms have,
come from his pen. His opera "Count
Verdi" was recently produced with tre-
mendous success by the La Scala Opera
company in Milan.
