Ali advance of titty dollars per year
in the charge for board and room at
the women's Quadrangle, making thci
total expense $300.00' for each‘callege
year, was voted by the Board of Trust-
ees of Grinnell at_their annual meet-
ing. The new policy has just been an-
nounced by the administration and will
take effect next fall. No increase in
charges will be made during the sc-
mester which opens next week.

The reason for the raising of rates
is given as the great increase in the
cost of food products which are by far
the largest item of expense in the
maintainance of the Quadrangle. An
investigation or the finances of the
quadrangle when contrasted with the
extraol’dinary rise in the price of on
table necessities disclosed the fact thatl
an acute situation is certain to come
up when the present year has closed.
Hence the Board of Trustees decided
to raise the rates.
Not For Proiig Says.

The policy of thc Board is complete-
ly set forth in a statement by Presi-
dent Main, which follows: "It must
be understood mat this change in fig—
ures does not indicate any desire on
the ‘part of the college authorities to
increase the charge. It is merely an
attempt, perhaps not an adequate one,
to preserve an equilibrium between
the cost of living and the charge for it.
The cost of table necessities has gone
up from so to so per cent and in some
cases even more. The increase ap-
proved hy the Board is an advance of
only zu per cent. If we look at the
figures on the basis of conditions,
there has been no increase in the
charge. The figures are merely an inn
ﬂex ot conditions over which the col-
lege administration has no control.
The college authorities propose to
maintain their policy of adequate
nrcintairiancc without protit."

A Flitt Rate.

Tire administration states that there
will be no change in the policy of
charging a ﬂat rate to all the women
living in the Quadrangle. This plan
was adopted when the quadrangle was,
opened and although there have been
strong objections to tho system the
administration believes that the plan
has been so satisfactory as to warrant
its continuance.

A comparison with colleges in the
cast which have the dormitory system
_has disclosed that the ratcs charged
in those schools are without exception
higher than the rates here. even
when the proposed increase is taken
into consideration. And the accommo—
dations offered in many of these easte
em institutions, the, administration
says, are inferior to those provided

- here. There is no wcstcrn college that
otters a basis for satisfactory coma
parisoa with Grinnell.

"His work on Ward field was su-
nreine, because as a man he was su-
preme." This was the tribute paid to
the late coach William U. McAlmon,
by President Mttin in chapel Tuesday
morning.

Mr. and M L, V. Phelps and
daughter entertained Dr. and Mrs.
Brock at dinner at the Quadrangle on
Sunday.

 

There will be no gll'ls’ basketball

The Wisconsin Players. one of the
best recommended companies of act-
ors in the middle west, may appear in
Grninell sometime in Febr'ualy under.
the auspiccs of the college Dramatic,
Club. The step was decided upon at.
a meeting held last night.

While this is an entirely ncw pro-l
ject to be undertaken by the club, it
met with great enthusiasm when pre-i
sented for consideration at a meotin
at that organizauon last night. a com
mittee has been appointed to manage
the proposition and the minor details
are now being worked out.

Act For Art‘s Salt .

The Wisconsin players not for art’s
sake. They have met with great suc—
cess in Chicago and other cities and
towns of the west where the company‘
has appeared this season. ‘

What the prcscntation will ho is as
yet unknown. The company travels
with a repertory of some three or four
bills, each or which consists of a group .
oi short plays or far-cos depicting the
life of the middle west. One at these
groups will be selected. I

The date will be so arranged as not
to conflict with the two society plays
which appear dnr g the same month. I

The (late of the chess murnament
with Allies, and the rules under which
it is to be played have been definitely
fixed according to a very cordial
agreement reached by the two col-
leges.

Saturday, February 24, was finally
decided on (is the most convenient date
fur boLh sides. The match is m be
played at ARIES this year, as it was
played here last year. The 1916 match
was won by Gl‘innell and was the first
intercollegiate chess match in the
state. It is hoped to make this an an-
nual ctfair, alternating the place of
playing each yca . A cup is offered
every year, this year’s cup being on
exhibition at Battling & Nuclmlls‘ now.

In a. round. robin tournament there
is always a chance of a dark hul‘se
showing up, but at present it appears
that the three of last years team who
are still in College are pretty sure of
places. Those are Hamid, Taylor, and
Jack Mathews. The Ioul'Lll place is

Thc new Recitation building will en-
able the ccllegc library to have some-
thing it has long needed—more room.
Just what will bc done with the in-
creascd space is the problem which
now contronts the powers that be,

Onc of the most important plans is
to convert onc ol the rooms made was
cant by the removal of all classes to
the new building into a “Grinnell and
lows Room." This space will be set
aside exclusively for material on Grin-
nell college, the city of Grinnell, and
the state of Iowa. At present the li-
brary has on hand a vast amount of
material relating lo these subjects, and
it will take several months to index
and file the references on the college
alone. There will be card indexes to
the conspicuous facts in the college
history, to prominent alumni, the fac-
ulty, literary societies, athletics, dra-
iuatics. publications, and every other
phase of college life.

Are Too Modest, Says.

“The most difficult thing," Librar-
ian Dickerson says, "about getting an
important part of such a collection—
pcrsonal history—is the modesty DI
Grinnell mcn/and women. 1 wish we
could convince all who have been or
are connected _with the college in any
way that their history is the college
history, and that anything published
by or about them has a place in this
collection. Old photographs taken
during college days are especially val-
liable. We are urging our friends to
forget the virtue of modesty just long
cnough tolsend us those stray bits of
news that make such a collection val-

arable."

To Store Documents.

The room which has been used for a
ncwspnpcr and loafing, room will be
practically hermetically sealed, the on-
ly entrance being trom the interior of

‘Llle building. Valuable documents and
An alternate will possibly be chosen:

papers, some at them a hundred years

.old. which are now being slowly de<

stioycd through the action of air and‘
light, will be stored here where they
will be safe lrom nll liar-in. This work
will be undertaken at once.

Willll's Iol'rii linolr's.

In connection with the proposed
cllitugcs in the "Lib" thcrc wrli be two
complete tiles of the college publiea»
tione, one to be kept in the new “Iowa
Room" and tlie~other to be stored in
the vault. Librarian L. L, Dickerson
says that books and pamphlets on car-
ly Iowa history are among the most
difficult to find in the book market to-
day. and about the only way to get
them is to find them in homes.

The files now in possession oi the lie
braiy are not quite complete, as the
list below shows. and it is hoped that
alumni who hilplmu to have the miss-
ing numbers will donate them to the
