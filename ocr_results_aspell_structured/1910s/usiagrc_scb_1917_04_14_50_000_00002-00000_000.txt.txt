SQTURDAY, APRIL 1-}, 1914.
“This soldier business is a seiious
business. It is by no means a had of
roses. It. may mean your life." So
said Captain lilumma last night and
for a moment military drill lost a little
of its pleasantness.

"They took it up Well. It would

make some of those Iowa City Iellows‘

sit up and take notice to see how the
Grinnell men took hold of it tonight,”
This was the way Cadet Captain A. G.

‘ Brawn emphasized the success of the
ﬁrst drill last night,

Captain hiumnia stands with "Doc”
Huff on the military training vs. ath-
letics proposition. “Some think it will
conflict with athlcﬁ s." he said last
night, “but it doesn't. The only place
it can is in regard to actual tilncf'

' THE TiiYOU'I'.

Is it worth while to try out {01‘ a
position on The Scarlet and Black?
This is the question which will he
asked by many students in Grinnell
this week. For their benefit we might
sum up the advantages of such work.

The two Colfax conventions have
given staff members a good his ht ins
to what newspaper work is First oi
all it makes its reporters into boasts
ers, for it seems that no "knockers"
ever survive as newspaper men. It en-
courages WidesaWakeness and makes
its participants into men who are alive
to all things going on about them. It
gives good training in the writing of
good English, and invaluable training
invllle psychology of public opinion.

Positions on The Scarlet and Black
stall will get the reporter into touch
with real newspaper work and will
teach him something of the makeup of‘
a newspaper. It also will get him into
close sympathy with the vm‘iuus phase
es of college life. Tlle reporter may
also become eligible for a managing
position during his senior year. ‘

It is planned to continue in the fu—
ture the new activities the start has
engaged in this Year. Series of prac-
tical speeches by outsiders such as
the ones by Ross Crane, Alhcrt Shaw
and others this year, will he planned.
The Colfax meetings also are assured
tor the future. These and other imr
pmvemcnts are expected to give smlf
members the best training possible for
practical newspaper work.

So if you are wondering as to wholly
or it is worth while to try out, you can
answer the question ailirmatively if

 

 

you are interested in newspaper work
at all.
