THOSE Wm. tLES

iii-prides are of two kinds turd are
cla. iﬁed according to their location
and cause. The wrinkles wtiicli have
unjustly monopolized the name are 107
cated on the forehead or crrrrc down
troru the nose around either . he of the
month. They are caused try worry oi-
grouch and should he m’mdetl, The
second type of skrir corrugations have
a tendency to clinrh Ilpl'iil'd from eith-
er corner of the month and appear in
hunches at the outer corners oi the
eyes They are (inter manifestations of
good nature and should be carefully
cultn-atcd. In fact. the nest way to
avoid the ﬁrst variety r's to keep a good
supply ot the second.

There are times when those grorrctiy
wi-iiiklcs seem to grow naturally. For
instance, a dormitory dweller arises at
sel'elleﬁflceu and finds that the heat
hasirt arrived yet; he rushes down to
hr-eakt ~t iii time to see the hood wait
or locking ttrc doors; he gocs hack to

' room and tools awa~ so niricli time
that he is late to l s eight o‘clock.
(in top of it 's he gets hack a semester
cram marked E and in the next class
he has to wiite an unexpected qrrii hy
eliciting the end all of ti _- pencil

Such a condition or life i bound to
bring the had kind or wrinkles Thank
Heaven that there are Iizlpm' \ 'tilkles
arailnblc to keep them from hcing
trial.

And the licst thing about it is that
we have these useful wrinkles entirely
at our call. They do not dcpend upon
health or happiness or previous (mildly

Tuit-L T0 QL'I'l' “PIPE" t‘ouli,

(From the Michigan Daily)

In tune or peace we havc often heard
it . id tiiat the college leader is to he
one of the future leaders of this coun-
try. This same maxim applies in war
times, The only dirtcrcncc is that col-
lege men have air even greater duty to
perform during and alter the war.

Second semester elections have been
made, but there still time to change
the blanks, and substitute other cor
es. if the government is encouraging
college educations at present. it is rce-
ogniring that they are ralualrlc. Small
things have no place in today's crises.

what pleasure is afforded him in reading Th: Scarlet and
It makes him forget the disagrccablc side ofsoldier-

It means as much to him as a letter twice a weak,

who do not receiv: The Scarlet and Black. Many of
these were in Grinnell last year, or at rile beginning of
