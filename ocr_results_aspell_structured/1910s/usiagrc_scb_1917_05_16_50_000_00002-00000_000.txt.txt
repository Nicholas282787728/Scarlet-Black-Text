THE COLLEGE NEWSPAPER.

Among college people there are
many driierent ideas or rrhat a college
newspaper should aim to do. some
oi these are quite mistaken views
while prohahly a rer tew are not.

“The greatest serrrce a newspaper
should render," says Harvey irrgharn
of the Des .lloirres Register, “is to fur-
nish rrewsn" Some editors will insist
tlrat the newspaper should mold prior
lic opinion. according to lrirn,.hut only
the oaicidl organs oi corporations and
other orga ' ations should do this.

And so, it the college newspaper is
to he a rcal newspaper its ehiet duty
shorrld he to tin-rush news. Otten
wiren there is a preponderance oi
hows it is necessary to reduce the
length of extensive critie.nis oi re-
citals, concerts, chapel services, ves-
pcrs addresses and Y w .tailss. To
some extent these are news and
should he gircn space, out lengthy
rerlews of these over s more prop.
er-ly ties rrc space in magazines
rather thn newspapers.

Ellm‘ts of newspapers on the other
hand, should he directed towards get-
ting and puhlrshing irnportaut {acts
which are newsy and unknown to any
great extent. They are drstrihutora
oi irriorruatiori. and as such should he
or immense value to the community.

)IORJ‘LiDON l ELOI’E.

Because he eloped last W,_k with
Mis Marichluhood, a prominent stil-
tlclrt at Mol‘lliligslde College, Don Van
Horne, has been 5 pended hy the
president or that in titution iriitil per--
innncut suspension can be directed
by the lactulty, according to a 1'97
par-t published last Saturday. Miss
Mallood was the daughter ot a well
known Sioux City physician, and van
Horne w s a senior at or 'ngsidc,
an assistant in the clicini. i-y depart-
ment there and also a member or a
debating tcillvl V\'lli(‘i\ was to represent
the college in a contest tonight. He
was .pendcd, according to Dean
Lillian B. Dliuulitt, because “a rule

hlisltod hy practically all colleges
automatically ends the course of the
student who nil cs."

That a man should be expelled hes
cause he his 05 seems ridiculous on
the race of it. If he neglects studies
the case ‘- lunch diircrent, hut the re-
port gives the irrrcrencc that Van
Horne was c. ellcd by mere marry—
ing. or com 2 colleges should not
become unsate'places tor parents to
send children, bilt where the girl re»
sides at. her own home the situation

 

is driferent. We hope our colleges
have not degenerated to the exterr that
a married man cannot get an educa-
tion. iowa, dunes, and sonic others
have students who are married.

I: the student is expelled, why not
do the same with the professor and
instructor who marry? The analogy;
is almost perfect. We wonder what:
lior-ningsrdc will do with those oi its
tactulty who .lnal'l'y? Would any
dare to try it? We somewhat doubt
the completeness of the report. It it
is wrong, then it is to the interest
oi liorningside to have it corrected.

We want students, faculty and
alumni alike to consider the “Conl-
illllnreatioils” column ol the paper an
open forum tor the discussion at any
side or any question,
