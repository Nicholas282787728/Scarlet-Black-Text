The base baii season [or this year
,has been a very successful one from
my standpoint. We had a bad Slﬂi’l,
which “as unfortunate and would “if
doubtediy have been avoided if we
had had at least one old pitcher on the
staff. If Jnruigtin had remained he
would‘have steadied‘lhe team in the
ﬁrst part of the season.

The fact that the team has improved
with every game is a source of deep
satisfaction to me. During the hitter
part of the season we lost but one
game of the last ten played and that
game we lost on a “ﬂuke."

The ﬁelding and batting of the team
was all that the student body could ex-
pect. We had more hits and rillis dur-
ing the season than our opponents.

The inﬁeld was the best in the state,
but in the early part of the season the
outﬁeld was poor on account of lack of
experience. At the close of the season.
however, it compared favorably with
any outfield in the sti-ite. The battery
came \I pto expectations and perform
ed well after the early season.

I think the student body are with me
when i say that the fellows on the
team performed as well as they could.
i wish to take this opportunity of once
more thanking the fellows for the way
they i-allie dnround me and stayed hy-
mc during the season.

Ziegler was the real leader in bat-
tihg and ﬁelding. hilt I think the palm
should go to Capt. Greenwood, who
Played in every game and batted at the
rate of 310%. Joe made an ideal
captain and l was fortunate in having
such a true sport to work with,

Carney was the most brilliant ﬁelder
and at times his work was phenome-
nal.

some indi ldual work follows:

Ciolldiess sliics ushered in the ﬁrst
event of Commencement week, and a
blight srln smiled down ripon the Class
of Nineteen 'i‘en as they ﬁled into the
cilhpel Friday morning to attend their-
last chapel exercises together. As
Professor Matlack began the organ lire»

feet. and paid honor to the class about
to graduate.

Tile music modulated into the much»
loved "Dear Lord and Father or Man-
kind.” and the audience look up the

the Senior Class Hymn, composed bi’
Mabel Clark.

the absence of these. has produced. All

Ecstahd‘s 'Les Romanesques” was
well presented on the campus on Fri-
day evening. by the Sylvan players of
John Nicholson. The play is admirably
adapted to out-ofrtloor presentation and
us say, kindly satire is a happy note to
strike at tbisseason ot the year. '
" All of the parts were credl‘lably
given, Mr. Nicholson was especially
successful in h interpretation or the
inimitable Sti-afoiel, Possibly the at-
(ecLlVeness of the part would have been
increased by a makeup less broadly
farcical. The same may be said of the
soullery maid Alnbrosine. in acting as
Weli as in makeup the part; would
have bad a ﬁner humour ii burlesque
had not been carried quite so far,

The lovers were as selltlmentally ro-
mantic as Rostand would have had
them. Mr. D' ' percinct was verY
effective, and his many friends in
Grinnell llili heartily congratulate him
llpon his success.

Rostantl puts a good dell! of real hu-
man nature into the characters of the
neighbors Bel-gamin and Pasouinct,
and the interpretation of both parts
was admirable,

The play was a real addition to the
festivities of commencement week. It
is to he hoped that out-ol-door perform
unces of this type may in the future
become a more frequent feature of
Grinnell dl'amatics,
