“I will bring the battle ﬁelds of
France to the very door of every man.

the parting remark of D. W. Griffith
to Premier Lloyd George, the Br ‘sh

Well he succeeded is attested by
crowded playhouses throughout this
and other countries. '
Through passports issued to bin] by
the French and British governments
Griffith was granted the freedom of
cven the front line trenches, taking
miles at ﬁlm of many thrilling battle
scenes.
