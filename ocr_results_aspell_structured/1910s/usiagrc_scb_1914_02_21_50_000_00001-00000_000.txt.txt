and “La Favoritd" were the two most
enjoyed numbers sung by Flauleill
Loli'l Konopasek and it. ilarcel de
noiizon on thei joint recital program
at the Congregational church last
Wednesday evening. The concert was
a beneﬁt tor the church choir, and
netted a ‘neat sum to that organization.

Fraulein Konopasch has never before
appeared in recital in Grinnell aiid her
melodious voice, powerful in the tones
of the upper register, was a i-evela
tion to her friends

M. de Bouzoii's dramatic instinct was
displayed to good advantage in these
duets with the Fraulein. His expres»
sire race and constant gestures vital-
ized the opera scenes. He was in .-
cellent voice, his harytone notes blend-
ing well with Fraulein .Konopasek's
tones.

Prof. Mallach accompanied the two-

artists, adding an effective touch to
the ﬁve numbers which cunllll‘isetl the
program.

GﬂV. GLARK DELIVERS ADDRESS

Students at Friday.
Chapel in Commemoration of
"Washington? Birthday.

Aiming in Griiinell an hour late,
a la Hugh mach fashion, Gov. George
W. Clai-ho. yesterday morning ads
dressed the student body in commem-
oration of Washington's Birthday. His
chapel talk treated or the necessity for
the application of the great political
principles or our ﬁrst President to
modern politics. in part (:ov. Clarke
said:

“We speak of politics as the ‘game'
of llolitlcsias it it were mere play.
There is no more room tor the play-
ing of a game 01 politics than tor play—
ing a game in the ﬁeld ot business oi a
great corporation. Theoretically, the
gorernment is a big trust operated for
the people; practically, it is otten.a
big trust operated in the ‘game' ior
DerSOlIlil gain.

“In times of war, men will sacrilice
their lives, even, for their country. It
should be found true in times 01 peace,
as well as in times of war. that the
pair tisiii ot men should prevail.

'n elasliness should ever he the
view or etery man, Let the man ele-
vate his politics to the same ethical
standard as that he uses in his T)\ISi*
ne, s. 1 tell you, inoi-al force s the
strongest iorce in the world today. and
it was the lacl: or such force which
lost the pi idency for Daniel Wooster
ﬁlm was in. loci . Nothing is more
deadly to )ollt' own individuality, to
your oivii me, than to refuse the die-
lalos oi your own conscience."

In closing Gov. Clarke said, “On this
day, in coninicnioiotion of the birth oi
W -hingtoii, [commend to you the dis-
intere-tcd, answer-ring public life or
Washington, and ask that you apply his
principles in own ideals and
life."

ing the basket featured the contest.
The visiting center made every point

playing a clever guarding game against
Loner.

Coe’s defeat, which eliminated all
their hopes tor the state title was
due to the plainly superior doiensive
Work of the Scarlet and Black quintet.
The visitors were allowed few chances
to score and what attempts were sue-
cessiul were made under unusual dl’fs
ticiiities.

Tharp Lt-mls ill Scoring,

Captain Tharp led the scoring for
Gl'lilllell wit hthree ﬁeld goals, and
put up an unusually fast game at the
forward position. “Dickie" had been
confined for two days with a had
cold, and was hardly in shape for last
night‘g encounter, but still was able
to car off iiidi dual honors and help
win another victory for the only un-
deieated basket ball the in the state.

Norris and Sherman, both in a orip~
plea condition, played the entire game
at guards tor Glimieil, and each held
his man scoreless. ”Bugs" also made
a couple oi bashets rroin scrimmage
tor the Crinnell total. "Billy" played
safe during most or the game because
