SAYS PEOPLE CANNOT WAIT
FOR ACTION BY COUNCIL

Editorial in Des Moines Register
Points Out Need for
Haste.

A recent cablcgram from President.
J. H. T. Main to the American heade
quarters of the committee for Armen-
ian and Syrian Relief urges immedi-
ate allied or American milita inter»
vention in Turkish Armenia, to insure
restoration of their homelands to the
thousands of reiugees suffering from
hunger and sickness, without waiting
for formal action by the peace confer-
ence creating an Armenian mandatory.
Hundreds Dying D 'ly.

The cablegram further states that
more than 330,000 Armenians, huue
dreds of whom are dying every day
from starvation, typhus, and cholera,
are concentrated along the boundary
between Russia and Turkish Armenia,
unable to go to their homes in the
latter region because the allied force
there is insufficient to cope with the
Turks, Kurds and Tartar-s who have
taken possession of the territory and
propose to hold it by military might.

An editorial which appeared in the
Des rioines Register yesterday morn-
ing offers a very sincere compliment
to the abilities and character of Dr.
Main and at the same time supports
wholeheartedly his appeal for inter-
vention. Extracts from the editorial
follow:

Mimi's Name Slltlllltl Curry Weiglll.

“Mr. Main’s cable to the American
committee for Armenian and Syrian
Relief, urging military intervention
by the Allies or America to stabilize
conditions in Turkish Armenia so that
massacres may be stopped, food sup—
plied and disease alleviated is one
more recognition of the actual state of
affairs in the region from the Cauca-
sus mountains southward and weste
ward,

“Coming from a man of Dr. Mai 's
type and training, it should carry
wcight that it has been hard to accord
to other observers who, being Euroe
pcans have not always been credited
with disinterestedness.

"Dr, Main’s appeal for help, it will
he noted, emphasizcs haste. Moreover,
it emphasizes military hclp. With
probably all the usual American dis-
inclination to accept commitments in
the darker places oi the world, and
with certainly no liking for military
measures as a general thing, his ex-
perience as head of humanitarian ree
lief efforts has convinced him that
quick action is imperative and that
only action of an effective nature will
do,"

The following articlc concerning
Alex Miller, c- ' 8, a former nrember
or the basketball squad, is of interest
to Grinnellians. It is clipped from a
special dispatch from the $81!: le15-

defeated for tlle division champione
ship by Battery 0 of the 121st ﬁeld
artillery last Week. It was the ﬁrst
defeat for the signal lnerr in two year ,
and Would not have happened but for
the fact that Corn. Miller, the best

Juniors May Nose Out Second-

Men to Fight for Third.

With an increasing number of men
getting out for track every night, the
annual home meet to be held on Ward

hotly contested. It is probable that
only men who get out this week will
be allowed to compete, so a number or

ISOplls and Juniors Best Bet.

The race for ﬁrst place appears to
be between the sophomores and jun-
iors, with the former a slight favorite.
But should the other two classes cut
in on the soph score to any extent, the
juniors may be returned winner. The
sopbs have four stars in Hass, Vinsel,
Evans and Crane, who are counted on
for the majority of points, but Larsen,
Linn, Winter. Hibbets, and someoth
ers are sure to add a few counters.

The juniors have a well-balanced
team, but hope to count heavily in the
distances. in which they will cater
Gordon, Kua, Seer-ist, and Smith. Minty
should prove a heavy scorer, as should
Bill Hoyt. Her-riott, H. Daubcnbcrgcr,
Henderson, Smith, and. several others
may also he counted on for points. The
juniors will be greatly handicapped
should noehmler, who is ill at his
home, fail to return in time to annex
the polc vault.

dent Main ru the Caucasus region, as
a member at the American Commis-
sion for Relief in the Near East, writes
of the ter blc conditions in that corru
try, Extracts from his letter follow

"Our ship, the U. S. s. Wostmount,
was the first American ship in these
waters. We reached here llarch 1,
with a cargo of 5,000 tons of flour, a
complete hospital, 3 motors, 52 sewing
machincs, some cotton goods and
thread. 5,000 blankets, 1,000 cases of
condensed milk, 5,000 pairs of shoes,
some other small store , aud four pa,

"We are now in Batum which is the
most southern port of Russia on the
lElack sea, cut off from the rest of
the country by the Caucasus moune
tains,

“In this small section of old Russia
lying south of the Caucasus mollnr
tains between the Black zlnd the Cas-
pian seas there are nearly a dozen
local governments, caclr claiming com-
plete independence and seeking to
isolate themselves from each other.
They quote President Wilson's 'Sclf
‘iletel‘nlindtion for small nhtiuns‘ pol—
icy in deiensc of their actions. This
country needs badly some strong nae
tion, as England or America, to take
over absolute control.

America Must, Be Arouscll.

“America must be aroused to her
duty in taking part of the burden of
governing Asia Minor and all this
part oi: the worl It is going to be
necessary soon in Russia, too. Terr
times as many troop ships as we have
cargo vessels, and a billion dollars
for government instead of one hun-
dred million for relief would be the
true economy of this country, if you
people could see it. England seems
lready to do it all alone if she has to,
Ihut America must come over for it is
really too big a Job for one country to
undertake."

In concluding his letter he adds this
note which seems to indicate that he
considers it most imperative that
America's duty is clearly to send
troops and help to this country:

I “I feel so strongly that America
;luirst do something over here that I
,am afraid that 1 have let it spoil nr
vlctier by reiteration, But I hope that
on get to thin ng somewhatthe same

Haas Is Sensation of Drake Meet
—Stiff Wind Slows Down Run-
ners on Straightaway.

GRINNELL TAKES FOURTH
PLACE IN MILE RELAY

Bad Tonchoff at End of Second
Quarter Loses Distance for
‘ Local Team.

Winning out over a ﬁeld of the best

‘runners in the middle wost, Carl Hass,

'21, pl'ovétl to be the sensation of the
tenth annual Drake relay carnival at
Des liorucs last Saturday, when he
won ﬁrst place in the special hundred-
yard dash, breaking the tape in :10:1.
Gl'inllcll's hall‘rlnile team rang up
three more points when they copped
nrst honors rn the Missouri Valley
section of the short r ay in 1:31. By
taking fourth in the mile relay, Grin-
nell received a total 0[ nine points.
For the ﬁrst time in the history or the
Drake relays the Scarlet and Black
competed in the university class.

It was decided this afternon to enter
Hass in the Penn Relays which will
be held at Philadelphia nxeL Saturday.

Wind Slows Runners.

A stiff wind blowing down the
straightaway slowed down the run-
ners cons erably. so that the hundred
went in .1 .1. Altlro many local tans
believed the Griunellmau would place,
most sports writers did not even r c—
ognize the probability or his entering
the race. Johrrsou, the_much touted
Michigan sprinter, was generally can—
ceded to be the winner. Butler of
Dubuque ﬁnished a close second, and
Hayes of Notre Dame came in third.

In the Missouri Valley section of the
short relay, the local team had a hard
battle with Kansas all the way, but
Cowden, after being given the baton
on even terms with his oppencrrt. out—
ran him and won by a safe margin,
The other members of the team were
uiiuty. Hass, and Vinsel. ulichigan won
the Western Conference section, run-
ning it one and one-fifth seconds faster
than the time made by the Scarlet
team.

Place In line Itclay.

Grinrrell took fourth in the mile re~
lay, which was non by Nebraska,
Missouri taking second, and kansas
third. Crane ran a wonder-rill race
[or the n L quarter.

The Scarlet and Black ran second
thruout the second quarter, but a bad
tor hoff was rrrade at the cud of the
hal rile, and so much ground was lost
that neither oi the last two Scarlet
runners could make up the distance,
altho .‘lmiy made up enough to put
Grirurell in fourth place.

Gr urll will not send any teams to
the Penn relays this weekend altho
a good slim ug could he made. Grin-
hell is no in class two in the Penn
mcet, which is a high rating for a
college.
