The never-aux players have been

Through Payne’s Absence.

Available registration figures show
that two hundred and seventy-rive stu-

fact that no new courses are being
offered. All courses are lecture.

The large registration, together with
the l‘thscnce of Professor 0. E. Payne,
who is in the east studying, has made
the history department considerably
