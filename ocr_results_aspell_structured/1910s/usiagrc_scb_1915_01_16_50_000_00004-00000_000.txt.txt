To the th-irrllell Students, Gleetlllg:
Tlle present world colldi or »
llrillg us to a. stupcudous chal-
lenge and it is ot that l worrld w rite
lou today. The challenge is to our
faith in ideals and the vision, we have
had ot the human race Tiling in peace
'arrd prosperity. To see a great nation.
such as Germany has heeu, pl-colaillling
to the World the doctrine that there
ever-
German culture and the llm'ltzu'islll of
the Slav, makes one question whether
oilr-‘taitll ill tlle feasibility 0: world
hrotllcrhood is a practical matter. or
whether- it is . upl_t the tantasl- oi ille
class room dreamtw. Can the German
and the slav live in peace together,
each mailing tor a greater people than
either could hoconle alone-l is the day
llslcl- to appear when men ot all races
can sit down together and rejoicc in
each otllel“s success without hurting
ritals consumed by hidden jealr
Ousles'.’ shah questions challenge the
r depths ot our lives. To these
questions the experiment at Amerlcll,
into which all races hare tlowcd, is an
answer- in ltscli. And .let there most
ever and auoll he ir-esh lnauliestalions
or our railll ill the coming lll-othel-hood
ot mall in which not only the Slav and
the (‘rermllll shall have a part,
