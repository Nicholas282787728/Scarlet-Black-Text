A sporting editorial which recently
appeared in The New York Evening
Post on the suhicct of Grillucll’s dds
mbittahce to the Missouri Valley Con-
ference, speaks in high terms of the
college as the “ odmother of Iowa ath-
letics." The editorial is reprinted be

Gl'inneli (Iowa) college has been
admitted to the Misscuri Valley Con-
ference without the slightest ripple of
interest in the East, and, as it ap-
pears, in the West Yet any college
that Produced a Speedy Bush is en-
titled to something more than per-
functory mention, Speedy. as many
know, transferred from Grinnell to
Princeton, but it Was at the Iowa seat
that he acquired his dazzling sprinting
ability. And he is not the only pro-

duct of this institution, which, as a
matter of record, is known in a 1‘07

Iowa. It was Grinnell who provided
half of the ﬁrst college baseball game
ever played on the soil or the Hawk-
eye State when she sent her team up
against Iowa State University In ISSS.

legiate football Was inaugurated in
1839, the Grinuellites dccisively beat

whethcr the sport was a new sort of
tatting or a variation of crokinolc.
Grinneli also went in for socccr when
the Middle West, or most or it, would
have regarded the name as uggestiug
some new wrinkle in breakfast loods.
In other words, Grinnell has been
"there" for many moons. in the late
nineties Grinnell's football elevens
used to meet those of Wisconsin, Mills
nesota, and Chicago and extend them
to .the utmost, if not beat them. Fol—

years, but in 1916 Gl'inneil had a good

With but one letter man in college
at the opening of the season, the Grip-
ncll quintet enurely reversed advance
dope and battled its Way ta a tie for
third honors in its ﬁrst Missouri Val-
ley Conference race, Winning five out
of the eight Valley games.

The ﬁrst two games were played
with the Cornhuskers on the local
floor. Lack of practice and Lhe con—
sequeut poor teamwork lost the ﬁrst
game for Grinnell 24-14. But the
Scarlet tossers showed a complete re-
versal of form in the second mix,
breaking up thc Nebl‘askans‘ plays and
winning 16 to 15. Captain "Pat”
Hammond, Griuhcll’s only veteran.
who had just returned, started at for-
Ward in the ﬁrst game.

Kepler Wins Cornell Glune.

In the third game which was with
Cornell at Mt. Vernon, Grinnell lost
her ﬁrst non-conference game 31-16.
Both teams played on the defensive,
Kepler’s long distance shooting for
Cornell being the main factor in their
victery.

The next game was at home with
Drake as opponent. As always, Crin—
nell won from the Bulldogs, tho it took
an extra period, the final score being
