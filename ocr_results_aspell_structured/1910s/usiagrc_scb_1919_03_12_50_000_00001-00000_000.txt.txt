Norwegian Explorer Is Pioneer In
Proving Theory That No Sup-
plies Need Be Carried,

MAKES TRIP WITH
‘TWO NATIVE FISHERMEN

Party 1‘s Given Up As Lost After
Sixty Days by Canadian
Government.
Vilniaruur Stefanssou, world-rained
modern methods in his
lecture at no ch t- lapel Sallll'ilﬂylel'r
cnlug. fr. Stefausson has been the
pioneer in proving that it is possible
to live off the country in any part of
the arctic. ‘ This does away with the
theory of Peary and other arctic cx-
plorers that it is necessary to take all
food with the expeditron.

In a polar expedition backed by the
Canadian government and headed by
Ml: Stefansson in luuti practically all
of the food aird other or nary equip
ment considered ncce _a at that
time to arctic exploratrcn went down
with the only ship lost during the trip
north.

Starts With Fishermen.

Mi-_. Stefzurssori proposed to start
liv g off the land. Finding iro vol-
unteers among his -men- he at last
started with two Norwegian ﬁshermen
hired by the dxy. The party of
three made a ninet -s eddy trip, ac-
complishing all which they set out to
do. They did not miss a meal nor
suffer undue hardship. At the end of
sixty days they were given up as dead
even by the Canadian government.

The fuel problem is solved by the
two hundred pounds of blubber, or ex
ternal rat, which an average seal ear»
ries. With the seal bones used as
wicks this serves as an efficient cook-
ing nre. '

The clothing and housing problem
has been done away with by Mr. Stef-
ansson dependently. Whereas former
travelers in the arctic regions used

"tents he has learned the secret of
igloo construction. This secret, which
has remained a mystery from the white
man for so many years, is that of leanv
ing onc block of snow against another.

Maintain Comim‘tahle Temperature.

The temperature inside the igloo can
he maintained at ﬁfty or sixty degrees
Fahrenheit which makes it possible to
remove the clothing in comfort and
thus prevent a collection of hoar frost
in the garments

In beginning his lecture, \Ir. Stair
ansson put his audience through a
course in the “University of Polite Une
learning."

I-fc pointed-out that contrary to the
general belief of the extreme cold or
this riorthcrn countrv,thc lowest he
had ever seen tlle'lhel‘mometl‘ was 57
degrees below and he expressed the
opinion that at the pole thc thel‘n‘lnlnoe
ter seldom would drop below 60 do
grees helow.

He ventured the statement that less
snow falls in the arctic than in. the
northern part of Iowa.

Professor \V. s. Hendrixson intros
duccd the spoa er. He spoke of him
as a world ci zen, a man who had
prepared rightly to do a great work,
and a man whose chief interest was
that of humanity.

Lecturer Says Conditions Differ
Mdterially From Those
In the North.

"Polar exploration in the north is
far different from polar exploration
in the South," was the statement made
by Vllhidmlu‘ Stelausson, the lttluous
arctic explorer, in an interview during.
his recent visit to Gl'innell.

”The larrd around the south pole i .
as level as the floor, there are no
animals to distur-h‘any food-which is
left for the return trip. The trip can
be made in the summer time when the
temperature never gets below 30 dee
sress below zero. These are some
of the conditions which make polar
exploration in the south a compara-
tively simple matter.

Conditions Adverse In North.

0n the contrary all conditions in the
north are adverse to the explorer. The
north pole itself is in the middle of
the sea as is all the sourrou'ndiug
country. This makes it necessary to
travel when the sea is frozen and
the temperature hovers around so be-
low zero most of the time. It is ime
possible to leave any food tor it would
not he in the same spot even the next
day since this sea of ice is continu-
ally moving about."

Stelansson is the ﬁrst explorer who
has depended upon the country to fur-
nish his subsistence. While traveling
over the sea his food was nrade up
almost entirely of seal meat, wlrilc
during his land explorations cariboux
were his sole source of maintenance.

When asked as to the tcasrbihty of
an expedition to the pole via aeroplane
he said, "The plan as a stunt or as an
achievement for aviation is perfectly
possible, but its .r-aluc as an explora-
tion worrld he vciy slight."

Famous GrinneﬂiansSpeak at Dinner p
0f Alumni Association in New York

New York, Mar. 10.7Forty-tu‘o a ,
tended the annual dinner or the Gl'lnrl
ncll College Alumni Association of the
Middle States, at the National Altsl
Club here Friday evening Samuel
Strauss, editor of the New York
'l'ilrres, acted as toastrnaster. Short
speeches were made by Dr. Edward A.
Steiner, Theodore Burton, former Unit—
ed States senator from Ohio, and Al-
bcrt Shaw, editor of The Review of Re-
views.

Professor Steiner is now living with
his family among the immigrants on
the upper east side and studying cone
ditieus among the foreign population
for the American Immigration com-
mission. I'le rclatcd many incidents
of his work.

Senator Burton, who spent thrcc
years in Grinnell as a rnemher of the
class of 1872, told a number of stories
of the early days of the college. "I
believe in the country college," he

said, "It has many advantages'over
the city school.“

Albert Shaw, ’79, remarked that he
remembered the old days, too,
much preferred the New G nnell that
he saw when he return :1 for com-
iueucemcirt last June.

' ’ve” dd enough of ,the simple old
things," Shaw said. "I’m glad to see
Grinuell get her ﬁne new liuildings.
l’tl like to See her get more endow-
ment and double the proffessors' sale
dries."

In discussing the lack of serious
purpose among many collegc students,
Shaw remarked, that college lrclpctl
prolong youth. "Why not let the un-
dergl'tttlnittcs be juvenile?" he said.
He added that while he thought intel-
lectual interests came litter in thc life
of young men at the present time, the
profes, anal and graduate students are
characterized by sel‘lous nur use.

Samuel Strauss was ' given the
honorary degrce of Doctor of Laws at

but-

unite“ in 1315,

Among the guests known to the
pr cntday undergraduates were ur.
and Mrs. Scott MocEachr-on, Harold
