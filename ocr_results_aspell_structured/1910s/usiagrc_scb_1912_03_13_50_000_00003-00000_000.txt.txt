PLAY HERE MONDAY NIGHT

Have Never Appeared in Iowa Exe
cept in Grinnell.

That Griiiiioll is to hear a marvel'
lons organization again Monday night
is lurtlier evidenced by the astoiiish~
lug w - in which the Flunzalz‘ys re-
oeiitly won their way to the hearts or
the London (- lics. The following
tlippings show how “arm was their
reception in the gran British cit};

"The periornianre," said The Lon-
don Morning Post, “was one or the
most perfect kind and will riinlr as the
most remarkable that has been given
by a quartet of diiiei-ent nationality
lo lllzlt or the composer,"

“Snell playing as theirs is rarely
hear , declared The Westminster Gn-
zette. For perfection of ensemble
and beauty of tone they are certainly
unsurpassnble,"

"Tile reputation which these players
have already gained in London," said
The London Times. “will be increased
by last night's concert, {or they played
once lnore with extraordinary (lelimcy
and vigor combined. The delicacy of
the solt passages was not lessened by
the rigor \\lll(‘ll underlay them, and
the igor or the loud passages was
not ill lliiishcd by the delicacy with
r ith the siiinlicst nuances were obs
server." ,

‘ he fine blend oi tone," said The
London Standard, “the complete undeln
standing existing among the perioi i»
am. an dtho breadth of outlook nian
[ested by each individual player.
brought about an interpretation as in
tellectuai as it was delightful.”
