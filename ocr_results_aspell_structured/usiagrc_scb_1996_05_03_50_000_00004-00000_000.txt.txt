Dear Todd,

lnPiers Anthony’s popular book,
On a Pale Horse, he is a confused
young man who tries to act with
compassion and do the right thing.
In Neil Gaiman’s Sandman series
and spitroffs, she‘s ii beautiful young
woman With a great sense of humor
and quite a bit of understanding. We
try to create an Incarnation of Death
which we can understand, an lncare
nation we would trust to treat our
friends and ourselves gently. Samar
times those creations can even be of
some help, though we know they’re
all fabrication.

When I received word that Lisa
had left her life infront of an oncom-
ing train, I had the brief idea of
Death standing there, hands on her
hips, telling Lisa in an exasperated
voice whata stupid rhingsbe hadjust
done. So, it‘s aflcllonimoststorits
of the afterlife must be fiction, given
the religious contwdlCUons of the
human race. It was also a brief corn—
fort—the idea that there could still
be some sort ofLisato be told off and
also, I must admit, the idea that some
one would do so.

During the past month and a
halfl received word of the death of
Tim, one of my oldest friends, and
the death of Lisa, my house mate for
an extended period of time. In the
event of a possible afterlife, I would
like to think that things are going
considerably better for them than in
this life. At any rate, they may be
generally agreed to have left this
plane, and those who knew them
must deal with it somehow,

If there is a particular knack to
"dealing with it somehow,” I have
never mugl'lr on. It doesn’t become
easier, no matter how many times I
lose someone I care about. Perhapsc
that is for the best; the thought of
“getting used to" the deaths of my
trienris and loved ones is coldly rer
Voltlng.

In some societies there are time
als. I wonder if they are of any
comfort? Should I shave my head;
wear black; sit at home and wait for
people to bring me casseroles? At the
very least, such rituals require a cor»
rain amount of community under
standing. I wrll perform what have
become my own rituals. I will re—
member to eat, work. and sleep. I
will tell stories of comfort to myself
and stories of lives to orhers. [ will
remember

Yours,

Sunday, May 5th, at 7.00 PM in
Herrick Chapel with a musical style
different from that people are nccus»

YGB performs a mir of tradi.
tional and contemporary gospel n1u<
sic. The traditional gospel music is
like what is sung in black gospel
churchcsdnsunday mornings. Cori—
temporary gospel music integrates
base and guitars with more of a hip—
hop beat.

They have no set songs to per»
form, but instead choose from a thire
ty song repertoire as the concert bar
gins. YGB head of choir committee
and four yearYGB member, Delaney
Dixon, ‘96, remarks “YGB doesn‘t
go in with user agenda [to concerts],
we do whatever the spirit hits us
with. We hear the music and we
sing."

To learn their wide range at
songs, the choir practices for three
hours every Saturday morning froth

Celtic Pride is a fluffpiece supr
posedly about the loyalry of basket-
ballfans, butwasreallyaboutmakmg
a bad film that preys on basketball
fandom. It has the content of a
situation comedy stretched into an
hour and a half. Even Damon Way—
ans' ( the Last Boyscout ) star power
and Dan Ackroyd (Ghostbusters )
couldn’t save this movie.

Dan Akroyd and his nutso friend
play crazed Celtics fans on a ram«
page, Galvanized into action by the
tearing down of Boston Garden after
the championships, this pair of half-
wits decrde that kidnapping Damon
Wayans (whosechatacter is aMicha—
el Jordonesque ballhog for the team

etics a victory on their last game

the film is devoted to their ritualiza—
[ion of the game and insane good
luck tactics. A master slave relzv
tionship is played between the loyal
Celtic fans and Damon Wayans

when the [\vcedle/dee and tweedle—
dum fan club is forced to release
Damon Wayan and learn something
very important about team loyalty.

decided that noone had funded the

would have been better.

Richard Pitt, membershatlbeenhav»
mg trouble practicuig at home, but
have been energized for the past
month after their [out during spring

break,

The Cliou began their tour with
problems because some sriicieiits in
the tenorsection could not go on the
trip. A week before the tour began,
severalclicirmembershodtochclnge
into the tenor section and learn the
new part. By the second week, those
who hncl shifted into the tenor 590
[ion became comfortable with their
roles and the choir had several mem.
arable performances.

One of the performances that
energized the choir for the rest ofthe
trip was at a predominantly black
retirement home. “The energy the
choirgotfromthe audience balanced
out the energy from the choir The
choir didn’t have to work up audi«
encc participation." Pitt said.

On the tour the choir went to
Chicago,St. Louis, Kansasciry, and
St. Paul, They performed at the
DuSable Museum in Chicago (or
alumni and had concerts forchild ie n
