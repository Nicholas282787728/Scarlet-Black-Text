'WHAT ABOUT CHAPEL?

0n the front page of the Scarlet and Black
are some figures that are of significance to
every Grillnell man, woman, faculty meme
her and administrative official; in fact to
every person interested in Grinnell’s \vele
fare.

What do they mean? Just this, that at
the present time, on the average, ollly a
little over oneetenth of Grinnell’s student
body cud faculty attend daily chapel!

Here at Gl‘innell we are proud to say that
in keeping with our democratic spirit we
have voluntary chapel service It has been
voluntary ever since the time of President
Gates, and may it ever be so.

It is to be admitted that there has been
a change from the religious and moral
values of a generation ago, and that Gl'ill-
nell is not alone in having experienced that
change; but that fact is still not a valid
enough excuse for the lightness with which
chapel is treated at Grinnell,

Grinnell college has an intense religious
background; it was built on that and it
must be maintained to a large extent on
that basis, This is not to say necessarily
that we are to go back to the methods and
practices of one or two generations ago, but
a way must be found to restore our chapel
service to its rightful place as the rallying
point for the religious feeling, necessary to
any campus, but vital to Grinnell college,

This condition of disinterest in regard to
chapel is aggravated on several points, In
the first place, students that attend chapel
have become a certain group that varies
very little from day to day. This means that
not only is there very little shifting of the
chapel attendance, but that approximately
nine-tenths of the students at Grinnell
7167167‘ attend chapel at all!

It is to be admitted with pleasure that

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

the ones that do go are there because they
want to be there, and they want to get
something from the service that is given.
it is better to have 77 thinkch than 400
sitter , but there can be little doubt of the
fact that if we had 400 sitters at chapel
we would have more than ’77 thinkers.

It is not asking too much that out of a
Grillilell student body of 7'10 there should
be 400 at chapel each day!

We abhor the idea of compulsory chapel
and yet there can be a very good case pre-
sented why it should be compulsory rather
than the way it is at present.

Someone might say, ”Well, why not dis-
continue chapel? of what use is it anyway?"

It is to be leared that such an attitude
would not express the true sentiment of
the speaker, for it is in reali v an attitude
of inability to cope with a tuatioll rather
than a complete negative position. Anyone
has only to think twice to realize what it
would malty mean to have chapel discoll»
tinned, Let u. not be cam-lied away by the
momentary fueling of pleasure at the dis-
ilii'sml of a perplexing prob/cull

For, we might just as we'll face the facts
and admit it is a problem that must be
solved. Chapel today leaves practically
everything to be desired and little to be
realized. lt isitoo much to hold the students
entirely responsible for the low chapel at—
tendance. It is also correct to say that the
average student follows the crowd, and
therefore there must lm it way found 113/
which the crowd will want to conic to chapel.

The chapel problem is a problem for every
Grillnell student. Tile Student Council as ,a
group has pledged its cooperation in trying
to find a solution for this problem, and the
Chapel committee, Scarlet (Mid Black edi~
torial board and other especially interested
students are spending their time coopel'ae
tively trying to‘ find a satisfactory solution.

It is, however, largely up to each student,
individually, and in respective groups to of
for suggestions and help in finding- a way
to make chapel mean something once more

to Grinnell.

THE BIG GAMEi

The Grinnell student body, together with
the rest of the supporters of our basketball
team, is anxiously looking forward to the
big game of the yeareDrakc at Des Moines.

The fact that the Bulldogs won their game
here has not dampened the hopes of the
Grinncllialls, who have risen to a new high
after the Creighton game.

The brand of play that the team showed
then is good enough to beat Drake, or any
other conference team, for that matter. En-
thusiasm is running high on the campus,
alld Friday night the team will have the
whole—hearted support of the student body.

Although the fellows who play Drake will
have the moral support of every Grinnellian,
they’re in .for a real battle. They will be
playing at Des Moines, away from their
home ground. The fans will all be for Drake.
They will, that is, unless enough of the stu-
dent body makes the trip to Des Moincs to
keep up the spirit of the team with their
active support.

The team needs a group of its owll falls
in the fieldhousc, reminding them that, will
or lose, G innell is behind them.

The trip to Des Moines can be made
cheaply and easily. A special bus will take
students from the campus to Youllker’s Tea
room, where a “GI-innell Night” has been
planned The bus will return after the game.

Cost of the trip is nominal, but it is an
opportunity to have a lot of full, and at the
same time seeiwe hope; Grinnell beat
Drake.

Let’s give the team a lot of support for
its big game! G

The schoolboy’s dream that someday he
will be president is a thing of the past. A
coed in the University of Chicago school of
business in a survey of 1,980 public school
children in Kansas City found that the
attitude that money is hard to earn is
common to all groups. Forty per cent of
the pupils feared they would be unable to
get jobs of any kind when they got through
school. ,

OPEN FORUM

To the Editor 0[ the
lscnnLnT AND BLACK
‘Dmu in Rowley:

I'm told the phlase should be
“intestinal fortitude," but rm sure
you‘ll llllilcxstnllll what 1 menu
when I say it’s what the Honor
“G” club no longer has

There need be no doubt, also,
that I refer to’theu- failure to
take what might be called the
customary attitude and action on
the rcnegmg of a Victory day

This particular inexcusable luck
of consistency is not their fault.
What happened utter that is.

Back in the days when men
were men and HOHOl' “G" men
were even more so, they would
have organized n flunk day and
would have carried it through by
force, if necessary.

Then they were so powerful that
they were accused of trying to
rule the Campus; no one hears
anything like that now, They
couldn't do it If they tried; but,
what is even more pitiful, they
don’t try.

In the Honor G we used to
have an organization that wasn't
afraid to stand up against the ad-
ministration when the occasion
demanded. Regrcmhly, they have
also come under its spell.

May I request [or a
prayer over a passing spi
spirit of Griilnell,
