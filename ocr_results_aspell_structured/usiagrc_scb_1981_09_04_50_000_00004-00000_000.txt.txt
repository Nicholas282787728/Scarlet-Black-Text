. The challenge

As we begin another year here at the college in the cornfields one issue
seems to be bothering us more than anything else: the inability of stu—
dent government to do anything of real importance.

We get the feeling that the SGA is doing a lot of “just going through the
motions” and that nothing of real substance is being accomplished For
example, at a visit to a Joint Board meeting last spring we found that the
members spent so much time “recognizing” each other, that they got
bogged down in the world of parliamentary procedure and ended up con»
ducting very little business.

And what of the business of SGA'Z Are running shuttles to the liquor
store, making available low-cost records and tapes and running one us»
ed furniture sale the kind of activities that we want the SGA to consider
priorities? Well, we bet that you can guess our answer to that. We do
believe that there is one specific area in which the SGA needs to im-
prove The SGA needs to become a more effective and more represen-
tative body.

By becoming more effective we mean that the SGA should mke a more
active role in determining policies that effect student life, and in order to
do that, the representatives to Joint Board have to take more time to
find out what the concerns of their constituencies are. In other words,
hall presidents should get off their phones and find out what is bothering
their fellow students.

In the past, SGA reaction to issues like the F—grade and the dorm
renovations has been very weak because nobody even stopped to find out
what the entire student body had to say about it.

In light of this we would like to issue a challenge. A challenge to the
SGA, and specifically Joint Board, to concentrate their efforts on
becoming a more effective and representative body, There is a lot of im-
agination and intelligence in the students that make up Grinnell College.
How about finding out what they have to say and acting on it?

Welcome, and welcome back. This is the obligatory beginning of the
year editorial telling you what the Scarlet 8: Black is all about

First off, for all the returning students, you should have realized by
now that this 5&8 looks entirely different from last year’s. We on the
staff felt that the old format had outlived its usefulness — basically we
felt it was boring, so we decided to try something new.

This new newspaper format is one that we think is better suited to the
needs of the campus community. We’ve expanded our in-depth news
coverage as well as our sports section and we’re now able to do justice to
quality pictures with our full-sized pages. We have also departmentaliz-
ed the paper in order to give it a “cleaner” look.

Another major part of the obligatory opening editorial is the line that
states “this is your newspaper, so let us know what you think,” Well,
thatjust is not true, It is, in a sense, our newspaper. It is our job to deter-
mine what fills the pages and our job to find out what is happening. And
that is where you come in, because it shouldn‘t just be our newspaper.
You, our readers, should be vitally involved with what appears in the
Sari}. That means you should be sending letters to the editor, calling
staff members with ideas or problems that you think the 8&8 should ex—
plore and generally taking an active role in communicating with the
staff of the paper.

We‘re glad to be back and we do look forward to hearing from you,

Enjoy this semester. '

Black/ white stalemate c

View Grinnell from a different persp

Being at Grinnell during New Student
Days can be an insightful experience for upi
perclassmen. The other day, as l was
reading in a hall lounge, I overheard an
animated discussion between a group of new
students, who were comparing notes on
their respective high schools. As the conver
sational focus swung from sports, to class
sizes to social life, one freshman remarked
how different Grinnell’s racially varied stu-
dent body was from that of his allswhite high
school. Others in the group chimed in with
memories of rigid ethnic cliques, racial tenr
sions and limited interaction between
blacks and whites, which they were hoping
not to find at Grinnell.

”Yeah, well that’s the way it goes,"
shrugged one member of the group. “But
who cares? Blacks here are probably just
like the ones everywhere else. They get in
easy just because they're black, they party
together, get lousy grades and then bitch to
everyone else about it," The gentleman then
concluded his thoughtvprovoking commen-

tary by declaring that he saw no need to get _

to know any of Grinnell's blacks, “since
they'll probably all drop out in a month or so
anyway."

Having been a black, and a student at
Grinnell for three years now, I was obvious
ly perturbed to learn that I would be droppr
ing out so soon, yet a moment's reflection
convinced me that my informant had over»
simplified things a bit Which worries me.
Although l am certain that the extreme
narronmindedness of this speaker does not
typify the Grinnell community, it does
reflect certain attitudes which are harmful
to the college as a whole.

There are two mayor educational arenas
Ior students at a reSldenlial college such as
Grinnell, One is, of course, the world of

academia, which is our major reason for
seeking a diploma, but the other, also highly
essential domain is our social education.
The ability to deal effectively with others is
a skill essential to a fruitful life and is more
likely to be developed if an individual in-
teracts with a wide variety of people.

It would obviously be impossible for any
student to spend more than one month at
Grinnell without experiencing some of this
social interaction. Yet it is highly possible
for students to limit this interaction to peo
ple whose backgrounds are similar to their
own. This is seldom premeditated;
everyone gravitats naturally towards in»
dividuals with whom one feels a kinship of
some sort. Yet encouraging this natural
tendency is harmful if it limits ones con-
tacts with those who represent the un-
familiar

The most noticeable instance of such a
division is the gap which many feel exists
between Grinnell's black and white com-
munities. In recent years, blacks at Grinnell
have been accused of having separatist
policies and being unwilling to interact with
the rest of the campus Blacks have in turn
denounced Grinnell‘s white population as
unconcerned with and unreceptive to black
needs. The situation has become a
stalemate with both sides apathetic to the
complaints of the other,

Yet things need not remain unchanged. A
new year has begun with new people on
campus How can we as a community halt
the Vicious circle of accusations and strain-
ed relations?

The solution is simply to View Grinnell
from a different person‘s perspective To
white students who see Grinnell's blacks as
clannish and aloof, I say this: have you ever
considered how you would act in a foreign
atmosphere where people who behaved like

Thoughts on returning

to school

At least hope springs eternal

First of all, i live in one of the houses on
Park Street, When I arrived, I noticed
sonicuiing new on my house and, in fact, on
all of the'residence houses. ilove it, What an
incredibly original idea. Wooden fire
escapes

Last Sunday morning, right after I finish
ed reading my student handbook, I decided
to go to brunch. There was an amazing line
at Cowles. Quad was about as bad. On the
way back to my room, i noticed the registra-
tion line for freshmen and transfers at Dara
by was backed up to the health center.
Paranoia lives! We all have to get in line an
hour early to avoid waiting in line for a half
hour once the doors open

I noticed something else Cutting gives
new meaning to the phrase, “If this line
were moving any slower it would be going
backwards “

Now that we're a week into the school
year, I imagine the freshmen women have
caught on and stopped carrying purses
That means we won't see purses again until

the prospectives start arriving.

I still haven't found anyone who has found
fitted sheets that fit the beds here. Except,
of course. that company that will rent sheets
to students

Here‘s something interesting, Approx-
imately 526 Students live on north campus
while only about 395 live on south, However,
north campus contains eight washers and
nine dryers While south lays claims to [Cl
washers and 11 dryers. This, of course, wlll
be remedied when the students living in
Loose move back to Rawson and Gates
When that happens, north will have twice as
many students, Also, twice as many
washers and dryers. because south will lose
nine washers and seven dryers.
