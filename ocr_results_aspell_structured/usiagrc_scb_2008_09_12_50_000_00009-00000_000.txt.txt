When oltl,cducarcd folks sign their names,
they often have a small army ofinitials follow—

not playing around, Clearly hc knows things,
about whatever those letters stand for. Isle is
taken seriously.

So in an attempt to seem important, I've
taken to following my last name wrth my class

Now, this was just a spectrﬁller my frrsr

Smokefree Air

Last week’s article “College responds softly
to the Iowa Smokefree Air Act" did a nice
job ofproviding an overview ofthe new state
law banning smoking on many businesses and
facilities throughout Iowa—including both
public and private educational institutions—
and the challenges surrounding enforcement
of the law

We would like to thank those in the cams
pus community who are doing such a great job
cooperating with this new law. We are also
writing, however, to clarify some comments
made in the article and place them in context.

While self-governance will Continue to
play a vital role in the enforcement of this new
law, that does not mean that the College will
not enforce the law.

As President Osgood highlighted in the
very same article, the campus cannot “nullify a
law"and will -. . .aucmpt in good faith to apply
the law." The quote that referenced Campus
safety and Security offrcers will not enforce
the law was in regards to the issuing of tickets
and monetary fines.

only Grinncll Police Dcparrmcnr offrccrs
will be issuing tickets/monetary fines in rela-
tion to this law. But Campus Safety and Secu-
rity ofﬁcers-‘or any other student, faculty, or

staff mcmhcrimay ask people who are smoke
ing in a nonsmoking area to stop smoking
and/or leave the area.
We hope this clarifies enforcement of this
new state law.

Register in Iowa

When I turned 18 two years ago, 1 had an
important decision to make. I knew I need-
ed to register to vote somewhere, but where?
Minnesota or Iowa?

In high school,I had been an active particir
pant in local elections and fair strongly about
electing quality officials to the city council
and the school board, Soon after arriving at
Grinnell, however, i stopped reading my old
local newspapers, and gossip from my parents
became my only source of hometown polirics.

I realized 1 had to register in lowa. I read
the Des Moines Register and the 3&3. I earn
and spend my money in Iowa (and bencfrt
from Iowa tax law regarding students). I am
an Iowan.

Besides, I knew absentee ballots would be
a hassle, If] somehow remembered to register
for one, I probably would not pick it up be
cause 1 check my mailbox so sporadically. if
I managed to pick it up, I better have filled it

our right there in the maiiroom lest it become
buried on my desk.

As ahuge Al ankenfan,1nearlychanged
my registration this summer back to Minne-
sota,

After slowing down,I realized that l was
thinking as a fan only, not as a Democrat,

Independent-thinking Minnesota may be
labeled a swingrstate, but its core values align
with the Democrats. It will be close. but neir
ther Franken nor Obama need my vote there,

Iowa's races are much more tentative.

In 2004, Iowa went to Bush with just over
10,000 votes, much less than one percentage
point

Meanwhile in Minnesota, Kerry enjoyed a
relatively comfortable rhree point load.

In our local state representative race, Eric
Palmer is defending his seat agarnst rival Dane
ny Carroll.

As a true progressive, Eric Palmer rs hclp-
ing ro make real change in Iowa.

This fall, I hope to support Palmer in the
election as well as he has supported me in the
Iowa House,

I encourage all students to do rhe same, es-
pecially native Minnesotans, and the first step
is registering to vote in Iowa,
