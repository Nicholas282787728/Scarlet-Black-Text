pm when most

radio, the FCC will soon reserve free
quencies of 88-92 FM. for large non
commercial radio stations.

Station Manager Steve Brull ex—
plained, “Although it’s not true in
Iowa, in metropolitan areas, a ten-
watt station congests the available air
space and effectively blocks a much
larger area than it actually serves
In changing the frequency, KDIC will
have to modify the transmitter at a
cost of a little over $1000.

The move is seen as both a plus and
a drawback by staff members. Rayfiel
feels “a change in frequency means
we'll be up in a range where we carry
less weight.” _

But Music Director Bruce Hoffman
pointed out, “To get down to the bot-
tom oi the dial, you have to have
KDIC in mind." Hopeiully, changing
the frequency will bring in more
listening by people who happen to
come across KDIC on their dials.

of chief concern is the renewal of
FCC licensing scheduled for October 1,
1979. Said Brull, “The form is being
checked over by our law firm in
Washington. l'm not really concerned
about KDIC, however.” Brull’s wor-
ries stem from rcc policies regarding
KDIC‘s sister station in Dayton, Ohio,
WDTN.

The college purchased WDTN some
time ago as an investment, and the
FCC licenses both stations through the
trustees of Grinnell College. “They
(the FCC) see the trustees as one enti»
ty, and if either station screws up...lf
WDTN messes up, it may reflect bad»
1y on KplC,” said Brull. Close tabs

will be kept on WDTN over the next
few weeks to determine KDIC's
chances of renewal.

Theft and vandalism problems also
plague KDIC. Buck commented, “Last
year a new mixing board was put in.
We lost some major equipment. It’s
scary that people can be so totally
selfish.” Chasins agreed, saying,
“Stealing of records really bothers
me. It's just so selfsdefeating, Some
people don’t take it as a very profes-
sional thing. Sure we‘re a tenswatt col-
lege station, but it you're going out
over the airwaves, you do have some
responsibility.”

When outright theft does not deplete
the record supply, inflation causes
record companies to pull in their
horns, often damaging the small
record companies that KDIC relies on
for their alternative format.

Many have either gone under or
been swallowed up by major com-
panies like CBS, RCA, or Warner
Brothers, Hoffman elaborated, “it’s
almost a panic situation. A couple of
people I’ve been working with got can-
ned last year. i wondered why I
haven’t heard from them. There are a
few labels dedicated to a certain kind
of jazz. but it‘s going to be very tough
for new companies to break in. It’s not
a very secure business.”

A perennial problem is drug use at
the station. Last year, allegations and
counter-allegations between staff
members concerning an alleged reluc-
tance to enforce FCC regulations on
drug use at radio stations led to ten-
sion among staff members.

Brull does not anticipate this pro

blem this year. “Station policy was are
ticulated very clearly at the opening
meeting. There will be no drugs at the
stationsperiod. If someone wanted to
do a show on drugs, that is his own
business, keeping in mind the quality
of the show must be maintained. If it
declines for any reason, the DJ may
lose his slot,” stated Brull.

Despite these innovations and
distracting annoyances, KDIC
management remains unanimously
committed to alternative programme
ing and radio in general. On radio
news, Bowen commented, “Radio
presenu a story in a way you can’t
present it in a newspaper—wiui the
sounds and emotions, and television is
too dramaroriented, too films
oriented.”

Tom Hayfiel is also optimistic.
“1(ch provides an opportunity to _
hear music you’ll never hear on any
other radio station, Commercial radio
has gotten into quality control, making
sure the beer tastes the same in St.
Louis as it does in New York," noted
Rayfiel.

Hoffman compared the KDIC pro»
gramming favorably with other sta-
tions, saying, “The commercial band
is a license to make money. The trend
is toward less and less songsr Com-
mercial radio figures that you'll listen
for an hour-and-a-half, so if you listen
for six hours you'll hear every song
four times."

Added Hoffman, “After the first few
weeks it runs pretty smoothly, It's
kind of incredible. There's always so—
meone over there broadcasting 20
hours a day, seven days a week."

At a meeting in South Lounge on
Sept. 17, the wile of Kansas
Republican Senator Bob Dole kicked
off another long political season in an
appearance sponsored by the Grinnell
College Republicans and the Program
in Practical Political Education
(PPPE), Elizabeth Dole was here to
talk about her husband‘s bid for the
Republican nomination ior president,

A former Federal Trade Commiss
sioner and a Harvard Law graduate,
Ms. Dole focused her talk on her huss
band’s campaign and answered ques—
tiuns about his views on a wide range
of issues. Several dozen students and
others attended her presentation.

Ms. Dole opened her talk with the
comment that her husband had talked
with her and asked his mother before
deciding to run lor president.

Besides poking a little fun at Ted
Kennedy, she said that her husband
predicted two months ago that Ken
nedy would be Democratic nominee
for president.

Ms. Dole discussed those attributes
that she feels qualify her husband for
the presidency. She stressed his long

experience in government, including
18 years in Congress Ms Dole cons
trasted her husband’s experience with
Carter's lack of understanding of the
system, pointing out the high expense
to the nation of paying for Carter's
“on the job training.”

Another distinguishing feature she
highlighted was great personal
strength. Dole was twice wounded
and twice decorated for his service
during World War II. He returned
from that war 30 percent paralyzed
and had to overcome great odds to
recover. She said his inner strength
makes him a uniquely qualitied
leader. Decisive, courageous leader
ship is What We need and what the
Carter Administration fails to provide,
according to Ms. Dole.

From there, she outlined her hus-
band s stands on a wide range of ,
issues, noting especially that he tries
to propose positive alternatives to the
Administration s policies.

Speaking for her husband in the
area of energy, Ms, Dole said that the
most important step to take is to en-
courage greater production of oil and
