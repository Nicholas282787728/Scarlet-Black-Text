Howand what comes through the“grape{I’ihé

by Tom Arenherg

The course most likely to receive
the highest Grapevine rating tor
class quality is one that requires a
lot of time and is taught by a run
prutessor who is temale and un-
married. At least. that is what the
results ota study by teacher James
Miller and his Public Opinion class
indicate.

Miller. a protcssor ot political
science. used a computer and
Grapevine it to rind what tactors
uiost determine class quality
ratings in the Grapevine. He round
that the amount oi time spent on a
class was the most important
element. .

Two other taetors. both or lesser
importance. were teachers'
marital status and rank. Using
these three elements. Miller said
he could predict class quality
rating

The amount oi time spent on a
class was determined from student
ratings in the Grapevine, Miller
said the influence of this factor
may be explained by class
reputation. He said certain classes
are known to require a lot or work
so only academicallyroriented
students ivho enioy large
workloads register tor them Thus.
they are likely to give the courses
high ratings. But regardless or the
explanation. he said the finding
”casts some doubt” on student
complaints about academic
pressure. '

Miller said the “happiness
theory” may account tor the in
fluence of marital status. The
theory says that single women are
supposedly happiest in lite,
tollowed by married men, then
married women and tinally. single
men. who are supposedly least

happy. Miller thinks a teacher's
degree oi happiness in lite is
reilected in classroom perr
inrmance, which in turn streets
class quality,

The influence of teacher rank
may be attributed to a student
misconception, according to
Miller. He said students assume
that full professors are the best and
that quality decreases as rank gets
lower.

Miller admits that the study is
not perfect. The basic difficulty is
that itwas based on several ratings
in the Grapevine, the most im-
portant being class quality.

He listed several {laws In the
Grapevine, he studied, which may
have influenced student ratings.
First, he said it presents a
description of a teacher and asks if
the instructor being evaluated fits
the image, rather than allowing the
student to originate his own pic-
ture

Second. he said the Grapevine
does not ask about all aspects oi
the classroom situation. Most
notably missing, he said, was an
evaluation oi student input. He
said, “The Grapevine makes
students look like passive rather
than active elements of a class. It
encourages the view that students
are victims,"

Third, Miller said the visual
image or having rating scales in a
column makes it diffucult
psychologically to take drastic

jumps irom one side or a row to the-

other when placing check marks.

Miller said he hoped the
Grapevine would adopt a new
questionnaire that would be more
sensitive to the process or class
evaluation. He said such judgment
was more sophisticated than the
student publication makes it seem.
He advised students to be
somewhat skeptical when reading
it.

He added that he thinks most or
the teachers whose opinions he
knows are either hostile or in
diirerent to the Grapevine.

Associate Professor or Political
Science Robert Grey said he
sympathizes with the Grapevine‘s
intention. but when asked it being
evaluated publicly bothered him.
he replied, “On an abstract. in-
tellectual level. no. But on a
personal level. yes "

Another teacher expressed in
ditierenee. “It doesn’t bother me,"
the protessor said. and then added,
“But i think it is a basic treedom
tto evaluate publiclyt.” The
teacher added that hershe does not
read the Grapevine.

Professor oi Spanish Beth Noble
made favorable comments about
the circulation of ratings. “I don’t ,
object. I think it serves a good
purpose . . . Students have a right
to print whatever they want,” she
stated However. she added that
she thought it might be a
depressing experience for some
teachers to get “clobhered” by low
ratings.

Miller said he thinks the
Grapevine has an inﬂuence on

teachers. although the effect is

small and unconscious. However, .
he commented that problems are
better resolved in a classroom
situation or on a face-to-face level
with the instructor, rather than
through the Grapevine. He warned
mat teachers may not know how to
correct a low rating because the
publication is usually somewhat
vague,

He said he thinks many students
use the Grapevineto express anger
towards a teacher. Miller said he
was surprised by “the lack of
civility” in many comments

He added that the results of the
study. as well as his explanations
and opinions, may be applicable to
all the Grapevines oi recent years.
He said he has not yet looked at the
latest. edition.
