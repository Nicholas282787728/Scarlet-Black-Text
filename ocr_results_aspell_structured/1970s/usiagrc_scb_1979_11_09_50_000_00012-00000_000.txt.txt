“I am trying to teach the students at
Grinnell to budget their time to win,‘
says field hockey coach Merry
Orsmsby. Evidently she has them can-
vinced; some of these scholar jocks
have been practicing twice daily ever
since the team was invited to the
Association of Intercollegiate Athletics
for Women (AIAW) Region 6 Small
College tournament which will be
played this weekend at Carleton,

The sun sets every night on practice
as field hockey lingers on, overlapping
the pre-season preparation of the
winter teams. Ormsby may have to
stretch this ”time for winning"

philosophy to the limit for her field
hockey players as they have a fifty
fifty chance of making it to the na
tionals in Priceton, New Jersey, later
this month.

Ormsby sees no reason why Grinnell
students should raise an eyebrow at
the prospect of a national tournament.
She says, “The fact that Grinnell
students know what a total commit
ment is, 1 think, is a big plus, I don’t
see why Grinnell students shouldn’t
win,.,l demand total commitment for
a varsity sport and I feel that I've had
total commitment."

After having coached basketball and

softbal l at Mount Union College and
field hockey at Youngstown State,
Ormsby admitted that Grinnell “took
some getting used to. It’s a lot more
liberal than I expected. I'm not used
to people telling me, ‘well, I‘ve got
this chemistry lab,’ or ‘I pulled an all~
nighter and i just can‘t make it to
practice today.‘ "

Nevertheless, Ormsby, with her
perpetual enthusiasm, has found Grin-
nell quite to her liking. Said 0rmsby,
”What appeals to me most is that the
students have a big sayeso, It helps me
enjoy my job more because I know
what I do is [or the students ”

Gridders score Bower’s Day win

Grinnell College averted a winless
1919 football season by topping Lake
Forest 20 16, in a Midwest Conference
Blue Division game Saturday.

Playing before an Edd Bower s Day
audience at Rosenbloom Field the
Pioneers wrapped up the season with
an overall l~7 record and a 173 mark in
divisional action.

“It was a tremendous victory,” said
first-year coach Ed Dombrowski. “We
played one of our most consistent oi-
fensive games, moving the ball well
both on the ground and in the air. We
were almost ﬂawless on defense, keep—
ing Lake Forest in relatively poor
field-position much of the time."

~0fiensively, the Scarlet and Black
were led by co~captian Fred
McDougal, who started the game at
fullback and then shif cl to tailback
when Gene Reid was injured in the
third quarter.

McDougal, selected as Pioneer of
the Week, scored a touchdown, kicked
twoextra points, ran for 81 yards in 20
carries, hauled in two passes for 77
yards, returned a kickoff in yards,
and had a 45-yard punt.

-His touchdown, which put Grinnell
on the scoreboard in the second
quarter, came on a 50 yard screen
pass from quarterback Tom Hanseter.

G nnell 5 other touchdown came
early in the fourth quarter on a 6- -yard
pass from l-lansetter to tight end Dave
Smiley. This play gave the Pioneers a
low lead.

The two Pioneer TDs were sands
wiched around 40~yard and 287yard
field goals by Pete Nierman.

Hanseter enjoyed another good pass-
ing day, hitting on 11 of 19 tries [or 156
yards. Top receivers, in addition to
McDougal, were Smiley, three for 43
yards; split end Kevin Oakes, three
for 23 yards; and Reid, two for 11

127

yards.

Reid added 57 rushing yards in 16
attempts before going to the sidelines
with a banged up leg.

Lake Forest cut the difference to
2045 on a ADryard pass interception
with 4:43 remaining in the contest.

Winning isn’t everything

by Rob Stdon

For Martha Brown, this is the first
year at Grinnell. She has already
coached the women's volleyball team
and now coaches the women’s swim
team. “Grinnell has been a total lear-
ning experience,” says Brown.
Although she has taught sports [or a
long time and has always been “an ac-
tive athlete," this is her “first year as
a college coach. It is sometimes difv
ficult, but i enjoy it," she says.

Coming away from an “inglorious”
volleyball season (2-250), Brown feels
that the record does not reflect a terri-
ble season. “It did not matter when
we lost as long as the team played
well together.” or those games where
the team did not play well together,
she says, “It really was frustrating
Volleyball is a team sport which re
quires an immense coordinated effort;
a coach can only tell the players so
much "

On this point, Brown says that she is
grateful to the captains of the team
who “acted as a liaison between the
players and the coach; they helped
develop team spirit."

Looking forward to the swimming
season, Brown feels that she has a
“strong team with some excellent in

dividuals," 0f the 25 women par-
ticipating, 10 of them are freshmen.
Brown cites three who are who are
particularly talented: Penny Bates,
Marcy Mann, and Beth Vilen (a
diver). “The team has a lot of. depth,”
says Brown,

Unlike volleyball, Brown has exten-‘
sive background in swimming. As an
undergraduate at the University of
Delaware, she swam on the women's I
team and since then has coached syn~
chroiiized swimming (water ballet).
“Swimming is much more of an in
dividual sport, " says Brown. She says
she “likes giving individual attention”
to the team members,

Right now, Brown is worried about
the upcoming meet with UNI, “We
just haven’t had enough practice," she
says.

At Grinnell, Brown hopes to start a
class or a club in synchronized swim-
ming, She also hope to restructure the
athletic training rooms, A certified
athletic trainer, Brown says, “Right
now, the training facilities need a lot
of work ”

.iohn Pfitsch, director of athletics,
says, ”Grinnell can be a difficult place
to adjust for a new coach,.,ivtartha
Brown has so far done a fine job."

Scarlet & Block,
