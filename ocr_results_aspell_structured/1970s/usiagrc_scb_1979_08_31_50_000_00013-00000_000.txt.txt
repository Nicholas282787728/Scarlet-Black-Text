Will they ever leave us alone? After
countless insults, sneers, putdowns,
t-shirt slogans, and ballpark riots,
antisdlsco fanatics Show no signs of
slackening the frenzied pace of their
persecution campaign. Neither the ob-
vious popularity oi disco music nor the
liverand-let-live attitudes of
discophlles seems to avail against
these latter-day Puritans, who respond
to toleration with bitterness and scorn.

To those of us who realize the intrinr
sic value and significance of disco,
this violent backlash seems puzzling

trenchant social commentary of the
Village Peoplel Yet not only do the
discophobes live (if you can call it liv-
ing) in such a depressing world, they
seem intent or dragging the rest of us
into it with them.

Unlike their enemies, discophiles
are some of the most inoffensive and
open-minded people around, refusing
to condemn other types of music while
enjoying their owr1. You never see

we ask is a place where we can ring

 

“Therefore, anyone to whom

the Village People does not appeal

is asexual and a forlorn deviant

from the mainstream of human existence.”

 

and inexplicable. Nevertheless, we
must try to understand the
dlscophobes, for a glimpse beyond the
surface of their irrational rantings and
ravings reveals sobering insights
about their motives and goals
Ridiculous and pitiful though they
seem, they represent a real threat to
the values and traditions that made
America great.

Instead of allowing everyone the op-
portunity to shake their groove things
and thus promote happiness, physical
fitness, and human understanding. the
discophobes would have us all stay at
home contemplating the culture of
narcissism and the Me Generation
while listening to the Grateful Dead
(whoever the hell they are).

The vibrant energy and enjoyment
of life that disco embodies, they would
strangle in a web of dour repression,
passivity, and dullness, leaving a colv
orless void in place of the intellectual,
physical, and emotional stimulation
that is disco.

Imagine, if you can, a world bereft
of the fresh originality of KC. and the
Sunshine Band, the epic sweep of the
Saturday Night Fever Suite, the haunr
ting melodies of Donna Summer, the

our bells and have our last dance. Yet
we are denied even this, {or
discophobes continually go out of their
way to make life difficult for us, even
to the point of staging a Teheran-style
demonstration in Comiskey Park, in»
spired by their own narrow-minded
ayatollah.

Closer to home, in the Pub, We are
subjected to a barrage oi bland, out—
dated tunes blaring forth from a
jukebox that was clearly meant for
Macho Men and Bad Girls

But why? What causes this
relentless oppression and the constant
persecution of a iorm of expression
which has brought joy to so many peo
ple?

Alter racking my brains and con-
sulting with numerous Soviet, Ugan-
dan, and lranian specialists, l have
Cilille to the conclusion that virulent
discophcbia is no harmless or tran-
sitory phenomenon.

It is rooted in dt-i p-seated social and
personal conditions, namely bigotry
and/or sexual impotence. Since disco
is the only type of music which brings
blacks, homosexuals, Latinos, and
other minority groups together with
run»of-the-mill white people, it is clear

that only a firm believer in Aryan
racial purity could object to it. .

These discophobes are people who
prefer “Deutschland uber Alles” to ’
“Disco Inferno” and would rather
listen to Anita Bryant than Anita
Ward. They are repulsed by the sigh
or people of different colors, sexes,
and sexual preferences sharing the
same kind of experience on a common
floor.

Still other discophobes object to the
erotic and explicit manner in which
many people dance to disco, and well
they might, given their unfortunate at-
i'lictionl The connection between disco
and sex is well known and has been
long established by respected .
authorities. As Glenn Hughes says, the
Village People appeal to anybody sex-:
ual. Therefore, anyone to whom the
Village People does not appeal is asexg
ual and a forlorn deviant from the
mainstream of human existence.

The much-maligned disco beat is
merely an extension of the elemental *
rhythms of the universe; indeed, if it
were not for the disco pelvic thrust, *
life as We know it would not exist.

obviously, much of the strident
criticism of disco is derived from a ’
subconscious but desperate desire of
the sexually impotent to cover up th
fact that they can’t perform and to
denigrate those who can. .

This is not a problem to be taken ;
lightly. Unless the insane spread or
discophcbia is checked. it threatens to
abridge equal opportunity and jeopar~'
dize the very survival of the human
race, while making the interim to
doomsday extremely boring in the ‘
bargain. ,

It is up to all of us discophiles not. to
stand idly by while this happens. De-
fend yourselves! Take a discophobe to
the YMCA today and, knock on wood.
we will survive.
