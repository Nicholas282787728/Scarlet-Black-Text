Turner expressed the concern that

Withers: An 'Enubler"

by Ken Winokur

The word relate has beenoverused
so much that is has become a trite
chiche. When Sam Withers, the re»
sident adviser for Gates, Dibble, and
Cowles uses it, it takes on the
toil meaningotasincere expression.
Withers was a student at Grinnell
from 1964 to 1968. Because of this
experience, he seems to have an
unusual insight into studentlite here.
“As a student I found out a lot of
the problems students have relating
with people, Students haven't
changed much even though physical
and social conditions have changed
a great deal.”

After graduating trom Grinnell,
Mr. Withers went to Chicago to try

- to apply some oi the things he had

learned. “Life at Grinnell didn’t

,have much of a sense of urgency.

I had a desire to experience and
relate the practice and theory of
learning. Do all of these theories
have any lunction?” he spent a year
and a halt administering aptitude
tests, as a protessional psychome—
trist.

Withers lelt his job giving tests,
and entered Chicago Theological
Seminary in the tall at l970, He ex-
plained that this was a step that he
had wanted to take for some time,
He is Still enrolled, and will receive
his Master of Divinity degree in one
more year.

The job at RA appealed to Wile
hers as an excellent opportunity.
”I wanted to do anything that I
could to facilitate better relations

’between students.” The job also gave

him time to decide what he wants
for his future Although he is not
completely sure what he wants to
do, he is oriented towards become
ing a pastoral counselor

Although wthers has a good idea
what he wants to do as an RA, he
ieeis that much or what he is doing
doesn’t accomplish his goals, ”We
Spend a lot of time looking at what
is going on, and I attend a lot oi
meetings " Withers views his posir
tion as that of “an enabler", “I
don't' see the roll of RA as some-
one who intel‘jects himself into the
problems of other people, but not
standing on the sidelines either.”
His goal is to be “helping people
solve their own problems",

Withers considers his job as an
RA as almost limitless There are
[ew things that he would like to do
but are restricted by his job "I
can experiment and try almost any—
thing I want.” His only complaint
is that his peer group is too small.
He feels that he doesn't have enough
people with which to discuss his
ideas and opinions concerning the
things that he is doing

Aside from his duties as an RA,
Mr. Withers is also carrying out
the duties of chaplain, and helping
with a women’s group, Since the
permanent chaplain is away this
semester, Withers is doing thework
oi the chaplain’s oilice, and is re
sponsible tor Chapel services. He
is also working With a group ot
women students deceminatinginiorr
mation and counseling sexual prob
lems.

Committees Examine SGA Structures

by Elaine Carey

A Constitutional Reform Commit-
tee and a Judicial Council Reform
committee have been created “to
scrutinize present organizational
structures, to ascertain their pref
sent uses and effectiveness, and to
maximize the responsibility and elr
ficiency of each organization,” ac
cording to John Pfeffer, SGA Vices
president.

The purposes of the committees
are to study the inconsistencies and
ambiguities in regard particularly
to students’ rights as defined in the
Student Handbook in contrast to the
son constitution itsell, especially
in regard to the Judicial Council,
Pfeiier stated that because olvague-
ness in the constitution, the Com—
mittee, he hopes, will ”go through
the constitution with a tine Comb."

A special committee was [armed
tor the review of the Judicial Coun-
cil in relation to students rights be»
cause “the Judicial Council hasn’t
worked etleclively [or several
years.” Pietter commented.

One suggested proposal calls for
the abolition of hall Judicial Counr
cils and replaces them with an
Office of Community Rights which
would serve as a Student advocate
or defender. ’i‘wo Judicial Conn,
ciisuone each for North and South
campusﬁwould be established con-
sisting of one member selected from
each hall. These organizations would

respective campuses but would not
affect the All Campus Judicial Coun—
cil which would continue to hearapr
peals and violations or the campus
at large. The main improvement
ol this particular proposal over the
present system, Pfelter noted, is
that the new structure gets the coun-
cils out or the dorms.

The committees are open to those
who are interested lnworklng, coin-
menting, or proposing improve-
ments to the structure and etiiciency
at these areas. in order to obtain
