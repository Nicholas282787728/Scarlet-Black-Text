 

, Soccer starts slowly
by dropping first
two matches

By Colin Sacks

Last Friday night, the Holiday
Inn in East Beloit, Illinois was
littered with partying athletes.
Some took to relaxing in their
rooms, some played poker and
some headed downtown in search
of other forms of debauchery. It
was Grinnell College’s soccer team
trying to forget its 5-0 loss to Beloit
College earlier that day.
Saturday, the team played better
in another contest although they
again lost, this time to University
of Wisconsin at Platteville, 3—2.
At Beloit, excellent ball control
by the Buccaneer halfbacks and
the inability of Grinnell's forwards
to put the ball in the net led to the
Pioneer demise on Friday, The
Pioneers were still in die game at
the hali, trailing 2-0, but were
greeted in the second half by a
strong headwind which squelched
any chances of a Comeback.
Starting freshman fullback
Jorge Morote was injured Friday
and was replaced by another fresh~
man. Don Pollard. Pollard showed

The strategy paid off and the team
played well, though it lost,

Early in the second half Mark
Bailey, with his dazzling speed,
busted through the Wisconsin
defense and scored, breaking a 1-1

could not hold the lead. A

All upperclassmen agree, “The
freshman class this year is more
conservative." This statement has.
been said about the lastrfive fresh-
man classes and is nothing new to
the Grinnell student of the 1970's. It
has become such a cliche that even
the townspeople in their gossip
speak about the new and conr
servative kids who attend the
college. How does everyone know
that conservatism is here? Each
person has his own answer.

Some say that you can tell by
merely observing the shorter
hairstyles on campus. Others see
the change by noticing the
“unrowdy” and polite attitude

The Pioneers now hold a 0-2

conservatism, The halls no longer
have the sweet smell of marijuana
waiting through the corridors.
Instead, a stench of expensive
European perfume swamps the
hallways. One Poll—Sci major
claims the hidden clue lies simply
in the new influx or Young
Republicans. one live-year
Grinnell veteran says he knew
conservatism had returned after
eating his first meal in the dining
hall. When asked to explain his
reasoning, he responded, “Fewer
expletives occur in dining room
conversation,”

ALL OF THE above statements
may or may not be correct
barometers for measuring conr
servatism on campus, However.
one major and not to be ignored
barometer has passed by
everyone's eyes: the 3&3 sports
page, Sure, most or you now think
that I am iacetious in presenting
something so absurd. However, let
me warn you that my contention
deserves to be explained more
throughly,

In the 1890's conservatism
reigned throughout the world,
including the hamlet of Grinnell
The newly founded 8&8 began
printing during these iormative
years and devoted a large part of
its print to sports, The newspaper
always devoted a large portion oi
its front pageto sports and the rear
pages covered nothing other than
sports. The sports editors’ names
were honored and listed in the staff
box following only the names of the
editorrin-chief and associate
editor.

THIS love for sports and Sports
writing lasted throughout the
period covering ww I, prohibition,
women's suiirage, ww ii, and
even into the beginnings of the Civil
rights movement. in the early
1950’s serious political reform and

 

boycotting began to be a part of the
Grinnell Experience Athletics at
this time remained iairly
legitimate as the swimming, tennis
and golf teams won divisional
titles.

The late fifties brought athletic
success and, in turn, athletic inr
teresl. Almost all Grinnell sports
teams won conference titles and
the sets sports page publicized
them accordingly. One could
hardly read a whole page without
stumbling upon an article
discussing a sports team, It wasn't
until civil rights became a touchy
subject and Viet Nam arose, that
the 5&3 sports page and editors
realized their honeymoon had
ended.

AT THIS time, longrhaii‘s. yipr
pies, hippies. freaks, druggies, and
even worse sorts attended Grinnell
College. Grinnell affiliates now
reminisce about their legendary
existence, Their campus activities
became known on a national level.
In 1966, the long-haired radicals
reached their Climax It was this
very same year_that the soils
sports editor was not listed in the
staff box, One can easily believe
that there was no sports editor
because less than a page covered
sports.

As Viet Nam dwindled and
slowly died, the sports page
gradually returned to its normal
size. The San sports page
resembled the ssh sports page of
the late 1950’s. Although the
Grinnell Losing Syndrome (GLS)
maintained existence in the late
1960’s, the sports print covered a
full page. Most oi the articles spoke
of the potential rather than the
factual Despite this, Grinnell
Students read with Interest the full
page of Grinnell sporting defeats.

Now, IN 1977. things appear
positive for the sports page and
Simultaneously conservatism has
grown within the campus com-
munity. This year, the sports page
no longer occupies the last page as
in most previous years. Fewer
advertisements clutter it, and the
articles receive more student
attention.

Who knows, maybe soon the
sports page will grow an additional
half page. Or maybe there will be
an occasional lengthy, sports
feature article, If so, remember
what implications are associated
with these new sports page ace
complishments, and belore you
retire tor the night remember what
this weatherman has said: read
the barometer. ,
