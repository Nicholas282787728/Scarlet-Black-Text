by many as its most appealing
feature.

“I‘m impressed with the way iolk
dancers hang on to each other," says
Jo Crawford. “All across the country
you tind this network or dancers ready
to welcome you. it's greatl"

Another attractive aspect of folk
dancing is the relaxed atmosphere “I
like it because it's not all overwhelmr
ing commitment," observes Jeff

Sherk. “I can drop in when I feel like
it and always have a good time "

For the more dedicated, however,
dancing is quite a commitment, “Folk
dancing is a habit that can stay with
you a lifetime,” asserts Crawtord.
“That‘s why it‘s such a perfect cani-
pus activity. College is a preparation
for life, and dancing can be a part of
that. You‘d be surprised at the
number or Grinnell grads that go into
lolk dancing professionally, as
teachers or performers ”

While most of Grinnell’s dancers
don’t aspire to such a level of protes-
slonallsm as undergraduates, the en.
thusiasm which goes into their perfor-
mances is phenomenal. Speier com-

Politics

As the nation approaches the 1930
election year, the presidential race
promises to be very exciting. The in-
cumbent has tower people agreeing
with his policies than any other presir
dentin modern times It seems that
every Republican (ex-something is run-
ning against Jimmy Carter, The
Democrats are begging Senator Edr
ward M. Kennedy to run. Governor
Jerry Brown of California is planning
to run, but is not sure when to launch
his campaign.

The field of Candidates running [or
the Republican nomination is already
crowded. and combined with the three
Democrats running with non»
candidacies, the campaign is bound to
coniuse more thaii a tow people, With
every political pundit and his mother
analysing this campaign more than a
year before the election, it’s no
wonder that people are contused.

In my civie»minded way, I have put
together a simplified analysis of the
campaign thus far and it should help
those oi you experiencing any dif-
liculties keeping the candidates
straight Just remember these two
facts: 1) three Democrats are Colic
sidering running, and 2) cight
Republicans have declared their cane
didacies, two are considci ing declarr
mg, and one has already dropped out

realize the amount of work and effort
involved in putting our shows
together. Bctwccn learning the

audience, and making the costumes,
we put in an amount oi time Coln~

30 nationalities, the two annual dance
concerts, one during Parents'
Weekend and the other in late spring,
are always enjoyable and well
attended
The high quality of these perfol'r
mances is all the more amazing con
sidering that some at the participants
may have been dancing only a tew
months There arc never any try-outs
for shows. Anyonewho is willing to
.learn the dances is welcome to par-
ticipate. a fact appreciated by all,
“It's important that everyone gets a
chance at the spotlight," says one
group member, “Oi course we want to
give good pcrtormaiices, but we also
want everybody to he a part.”
Another student put it this way:

“l ve always been a klutz. where else‘
could I get up on stage in a iancy
costume without iccliiig idiotic?
Nowhere. " ,

Yet, even Without. the perloi-mances,
most group members would still be ,

reasons for their continued interest. “I
was searching tor the ultimate truth, a
guiding ligiit on which to base my lite."
intones Leslie Sobel through a haze of '
incense “Dancing has given a new‘
dimension to my litel "

Although research on possible brain‘
damage due to excessive dancing has
not yet been completed, several .
dancersdo hypothesize that tolk danc-
ing reilects personality. “It’s the best
way I can think of to get rid of your
inhibitions,” says Jon Paulos Kathy
Haskins agrees saying, “It's so rela

best: ”For me it's like the line in the -
