Millions must be invested

We are about to experience a change in lifestyle more dramatic than any such change since the in- j
dustrial revolution. The days of a highly mobile, rapidly growing, wasteful society are over

But few seem willing to face this reality. People still drive eight- cylinder autos which could feel at _.
home on the sea, the 55 m p h speed limit 15 still ignored, and many still set their thermostats at 60 in -
the summer and 80 in the winter Americans just are not ready to live in a world of reduced means, .

And that’s a shame, because there seems to be nothing on the technical horizon that would indicate
a new, cheap, and plentiful fuel to replace oil. Like it or not, lifestyle changes will have to be made. i

Nonetheless, people want to put off these changes as long as possible. When our plans for this issue
became known, several people responded: ”You’re not going to bore us with another energy'
issuel. 7" '

But ignoring, or putting off, the problem will only make its eventual impact more sevei e, Such an
idea should be appalling to “liberally educated”students and to a college that prides itself on such an - -
education.’

Grinnell College cannot afford to sit back and hope that someone finds an answer to eneigy pt 0- .
blems The college must actively work toward finding solutions to the problem.

This means encouraging other ACM schools to seriously consider significant calendar changes it
means pooling academic talent to work on energy projects, And it means vigorous conservation pro- ' '
grams and intelligent examinations of campus problem areas .

For Grinnell to significantly alter its calendar without the consent of other ACM schools would .
cause serious problems. Athletic schedules and cooperative programs would be thrown into chaos.
But the other schools are in the same energy boat as Grinnell. And since their endowments are not as , ,
healthy as Grinnell's, they’ re sinking even faster than we are.

Grinnell cannot just sit burning the last few drops of our oil supplies hoping that new fuels and
technologies will be developed; to do so would invite financial ruin. Science professors must be en-
couraged to do research in areas concerning energy. To assure these projects do not overburden, ',
teaching staffs the projects can be done cooperatively between several colleges,

These things though important for Grinnell s immediate future, will pay off most heavily in the , _
long term

For the short-term, Grinnell must concentrate on conservation. This includes both conventional»
forms of conservation, and also more drastic forms. Some of the campus’ most attractive moder ‘
architecture—the Forum, Burling Library, the Fine Arts Building—must be viewed from an energ
perspective Beautiful though it is, Grinnell cannot afford the Forum as it is now constructednor
the Burling Library ' '

Severe changes' 1n the structures must be made with energy conservation in mind, ,

What we re suggesting will not be cheap—the college will probably end up sinking several million ’
dollars on such a program. But there' is no choice.

Grinnell has a very healthy endowment, which is sitting around gaining interestiinsurance for
the future of the college, so we re told, But the truth is, without major changes in the college‘s energy’
program, Grinnell College has no future

Endowment dollars must be directed into investments which will make the college mot e efficient -
than it is now. A well- coordinated, concerted campus effort must begin now—the futut e dividends of '1
which will be more valuable than our stock portfolio, .

We call on President Drake to move energy to the top of his list of priorities. We suggest he {1 ea _,

Ken Browning from his other vice provosorial duties so that Browning may spend his last months at '
Grinnell developing a plan for the future. By the time he leaves Grinnell, Browning should have
developed a comprehensive, innovative plan of action. ,

Time must not be wasted. The era of scarcity is coming, and it will wait for no one. ' l5
