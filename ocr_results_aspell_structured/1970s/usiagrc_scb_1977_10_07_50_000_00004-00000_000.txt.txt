CBS initiates

worthy cause
with STOPIT

Concerned Black Students (CBS) inaugurated its
“Students and Teachers Opposed to Practices Intolerable
and Timid” ISTOPIT} campaign with an open forum one
week ago yesterday. The results were impressive.

Advisor Charles Davis and the CBS speakers outlined
worthy goals: increases in the number of non-white faculty,
staff and administrators, in the number of non-white
students, and in the number of courses pertaining to non-
white minority groups.

i CBS ANNOUNCED plans to have monthly meetings with
administrators and established committees to help pursue its
goals. It appears that CBS is adamant in its efforts and is
planning to focus on numerous points of access.

The key question is how far CBS will push STOPIT. No
percentages were outlined at the forum as desired levels of
non~white students and faculty among the Grinnell College
community. We hope CBS will push for levels close enough
to the national level of non-white Ph. D. holders and of non-
white qualified (by Grinnell’s current standards) high school
graduates to maintain the quality of this college’s faculty
and student body.

BECAUSE GRINNELL'S small non-white town and
college community makes this school unattractive to non-
whites, it is very doubtful— regardless of vigorous recruiting
effortsithat we could attract percentages of non-white Ph,-
D. holders and qualified graduates far above the national
levels. So, to maintain quality, we suggest aiming for levels
equal to or slightly above the national percentages. We
encourage CBS to be active and strong in its STOPIT ef-
forts, but cautious about setting desired percentages.

A large crowd attended the open forum, owing to a good
job of publicizing by CBS and, most heartening, to a genuine
interest in the issue among students. The effort to establish
and keep good relations with the community lapsed a bit
during the fonim. Many considered Davis' behavior to be
abrasive for much of the forum. For example, his tone toward
music professor Theodore Solis was considered by many to
be inappropriate, To be sure, he did make a nice gesture by
publically apologizing to the editor of the S & B for earlier
behavior, but his behavior at other times was considered by
many to be overly caustic.

WE SAY this to provide constructive suggestion for
maintaining good community relations. Such good relations
are often the key to gaining rather than losing the support of
marginally interested people.

From early indications, Davis and CBS have established a
worthy cause. We urge people to support it.

Letters to the editor

Memo editor Deminoff defends
decisions on handling of student notices

To the editor: Ms. Vicki Fontanini
alleges “outright and uh-
compromising censorship” on my
part as editor of Campus Memo
(S 8r B. Sept, 30). Ms. Fontanini
builds a lengthy philosophical and
political case based on what she
believes are my personal views on
various matters. I think the better
approach to the issue is simply to
gel at the facts. The facts either
show “outright and unr
compromising censorship" or they
do not,

1, Ms. Fontanim says I dcleted
the name of Anita Bryant from 3
Memo notice because I am
presumably in sympathy with Ms.
Bryant (1 am not) and because the
notice as submitted called her “a
crusader against human rights.”
The fact is the item called her
something more than that. The
epithet was a mild one, but it was
nevertheless name-calling. Do we
wish name calling to any degree to
characterize a publication of
Grinnell College?

2, MS. FONTANINI calls my
actions “uncompromising." She
implies that l suppress notices and
claims that she is “cheated out of
the Simple right to know what other
students are doing on campus.”
The fact, however, is that, on
deciding to delete the references to
Ms. Bryant, I called the student
who submitted the notice, told her
of the deletion, and proposed an
alternative so that the substance of
the notice could still appear. I
suggested that the item be com-

 

bined with another Women’s Group
notice which mentioned the same
subject, The student said that this
was unacceptable, and i then
asked that she rewrite the item,
She did so, and the notice, headed
“A Day for Human Rights," ap~
pears on page 7 oi the Memo in
question, and the other Women's
Group notice appears on page a.
Does this constitute an unr
compromising abridgmenl or the
student's right to know7

3 Ms. Fontanini says that i
suppressed a notice about Grin-
nellians‘ participation in a
demonstration at Kent State. The
notice submitted to me was not an
announcement of an event, and
nowhere in it did it refer to
students taking part in an event.
The item was a declaration or
affirmation of support tor op-
pressed peoples, with a clusing
line on behalf of the Spirit of Kent
and Jackson State. Why turn back
an item that has so laudable an
intention? Ms. Fontanini says it's
because of the ”editor’s refusal to
publish an opinion undoubtedly
contrary to his own." No, that is
not the reason. it is, rather, that
Memo is just that: it is a
memorandum to the campus; it
provides information that helps
students and others with their day
today business at the college. It is
not a journal of opinion or a vehicle
for polemics. If it were, the cost of
producing it would be far greater
than it is now and it would not
serve the purpose it was founded

 

for. Each week’s notices now run
anywhere from eight to 11 pages.
For an llrpage Memo, some 7,000
sheets of paper are used in its
production. How much would that
increase it we opened it to
manifestos, declarations, and
debate? And what would happen to
Memo as simply a Vehicle of in
formation?

4. MS. FONTANINI sees me as
humorless and prejudiced because
i deleted a onerliner from a gay
community notice oi a meeting.
But the fact is that the notice itself
ran in the Memo;fhe joke added
nothing.

6. Ms, Fontanini says that I do
not “support" the announcements
submitted by gay, ieminist, and
leitist groups. 1 don’t know what's
meant by support in this context.
My job as editor is to run an
nouncements that are submitted to
us as long as they do not violate
anybody's rights. it inclusion of
items in Memo is any criterion for
determining prejudice, it should be
noted that there have been 16
notices (three. nine, and four,
respectively) included in the live
issues of this year's Memo from
the three cups mentioned above.

FINAL; AND more at-
firmative y, I would like to say
that. far from viewing Memo as a
vehicle governed by prejudice and
censorship, I see it each week as a
reflection of the richness and
variety of experience that is
Grinncll. i cannot fault anyone who
wants those qualities preserved
and protected. William Deiiiinoff

Prosecution of guilty individuals,

stands as key issue at Kent State

To the editor, First of all. I would
like to thank Rob Henak and Kurt
Shroeder for their letter to the
editor in the September 30th issue.
Grinnell is indeed known for
progressivism and activism, and
we should maintain these at
tributes no matter where we stand
on a given issue. As Mark Krause
said in his article In the same issue,
there are “no easy answers," and
certainly no solutions will be
reached unless we are willing to
share our opinions. Apathy is
unacceptable in a society
dominated by conflict

Furthermore, we must be
receptive to each other's views A
conservative who understands
(and perhaps even accepts to some
degree) the liberal viewpoint is
both more constructive and more
persuasive ior his causc than one
who denounces all liberals as
idealists. Of course, the reverse is
also true. As things now stand, I
wouldn't like to find myself
positioned between Kurt Schroeder
and Bruce Weindruch late at night
in the pub.

 

BUT i have been digressing
lrom the start. What I really want
to comment on is the controversy
over the gym being built at Kent
State. Of course, for the gym to be
built, and for the issue to end there.
would be an atrocity The
slaughter of. four students by a
government agency cannot be
Iorgotten. But we must remcmber
where the issue truly lies. A Sinai]
but significant mistake appeared
in the September 30 issue. Four
”student antivwar protesters”
were not killed on May 4, 1970.
Sandra Sclieuei' was walking from
her class and was not participating
in the demonstration, The National
Guard claims that they shot
essentially in selfrdeiense at an
aggressive crowd. This is
prevarication. Sandra Scheuer was
approximately 300 yards away
from the gun which fired the bullet
that killed her. She was no threat to
anyone, Indeed, most of those
wounded were more than 100 yards
lrom the nearest guardsman. We
have here a case of murder and we
must treat it as such.

 

THE GYMNASIUM issue is an
ethical one, but it has brought back
into the public eye a much more
important issue: the Kent State
massacre remains an unsolved
murder. We must direct our anger
and frustration toward making
sure that the investigations of this
incident Continue until those
responsible are brought to justice,

it looks as if the gym l5 going to
be built But we should not consider
this a defeat. The many speeches
and quiet demonstrations and
services I saw there last May 4,
seven years after the shooting,
assured me that the 'Kent State
lssueis not about to be forgotten. if
those responsible for the shootings
are iinally prosecuted. we can let
the gym stand as a symbol of the
establishments unsuccessful
attempt to sweep the issue under
the carpetia great concrete irony.

Don't misunderstand me—l
would rather the gym not be built
on that site. But We must not let
this symbolic issue overshadow the

original, more important one. 0
