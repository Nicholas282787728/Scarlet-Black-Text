The Marriage of the Deformed Prince

El nino estaba solo
Con la ciudad dormida en la garganta.
— - Lorca

The child is watching you alone; you are held fast

Inside a stunted chamber where animals cry the past;
The twilight’s norms mix wincing with the celebrants’
Ritual objects on the alter: the high priest's armaments;
His spies are laced with wonder at the open heresies

0f the dwarf with throat inhabited by sleeping cities.

The longrawaited marriage of the deformed prince

Is a nameless festival, unique; the sacred things
Themselves inhabit cages of split space. The nobles call
For scapegoats in behalf of Magic. Deviation‘s thrall

Is flattened by the childhood ofa foreign Moon, disguising
To be simultaneous with suns in random rising.

The dwarf is mute; the priest is stubborn in the whip's employ,
He fears the dormant cities in the torn throat of the boy.

The cities, ribbed with amnesia, spined by suns in rage,
landscape-lined, the cities choked with laughter maze

Before us, nerveless beads. The dwarf is locked with silence,
His throat is full of mind and cities and primeval violence.

The whip is black and pliant as it cuts across the skin

Of dwarf<hide. Cities lurch and spew without; within,

The child awakens in the dwarf’s marred brain; remembrance
Animates the cities as they pour upon the floor. By chance

01 lodges in the eye of the deformed prince; thus thrown,

The cities sprout. The dwarf is watching you alone.

Song

(he day Iplucked the cluStered nerves
Which hung beneath the sea’s tight skin;
A tactile impulse drove in curves
From surface—earth to earth within.»

One day the mind's dark bastions fell
To tcndrils in disarray;

(he day I stirred and cracked the spell
Of the armies of decay.

Spun tubular, in metal veins
Ipeeled and sucked the earth;

Iceﬂowers, globes, and acid rains
Came with me to my birth.

affairs. Again the felt self~
satisfied and proud. But things

around him seemed so quiet,
no one else was reveling in

this inward fanfare, and the
man was actually a little ash-
amed of himself when he looks
ed around to find only a very
few houselights were on.

It was a very sleepy night
out, with a before dawn feel-
ing about it. Things seemed
to be out of temporal context.
Now, either he was late, or
everybody else was early, or
something like that. He lcnew
it was the wrong time for the
milktruck which drove past.
And that paperboy on the cor-
ner, sleepily rolling papers
with his frozen fingers, using
those same rubber bands used
in parlays ofjusticewithevery
junior high school teacher in
the world, why he was aston-
ishing. Yet the sun had gone
down only a half an hour ago.
The man with the black curly
hair lo-iew that the only people
up at this hour, even if it was
the wrong hour, were the old
ladies in flower print dresses
who had gotten up to water
their african violets before the
Morning Star Gazette was den
livered. He looked up from
the sidewalk atone ofthe large
porched houses and spotted a
hatted lady peering at him.

Look out! Oh look out! shrier
ked the lady in the navy blue
broad brimmedhatandmatch~
ing shoes, as she ran out of
her house and down the stairs.

Don’t let him catch you in the
thigh!

No mam.
mam.

But would you please tell me

said the man. No

what you’re talking about?
There was a man about like
you, said the lady with a wild

look in her eye.

He was just walking down by
the sea, why he wasjustwallﬁ
ing on the seashore in the sand
and all ofa sudden out of no-l
wheres an Angel of the lord
jumped him from behind ohmy
god, who was gray and you
could see right through him,
and they commenced grapplt‘
ing and wrestling like as to
kill each Other. You’ve never
seen the way they picked each‘
other up and slammed him
down in the sand, you could
hardly tell at all that theywas
getting tired except they was
out of breath right from the
start. God they must have
wrestled half through the night
and you could just see that
every time the angel went for
the thigh he was serious be-'
cause it looked like as if he;
knew he could close it down.
Of course, I knew that he was
cheating and every time I seen
him at it, I got my umbrella
ready to dive in and square
things up. Not that Iwas age
ainst the angel and for the
man, you understand, it’s just
that I'm against cheating es-
pecially when they was rag—
ing down the seashore the way
they was. Why it was sucha
close fight they fought themr
selves through half the night
to exhaustion until the man
finally grabbed the Angel by
the arm and threw him plumb
in the sea.

That's. That's really a vcry.§

Very interesting story. said

the man to the old lady, and,

without further comment, still
breathing hard, set off down

the beach witha great feeling
of exaltation, of exhiliration.
Never before had the cry' of
the gulls through the fogsounr
ded so exalted, sublime. As
he heaved his breath in and
out deeplu, deeply smellting
the fog which seemed tocarry
not only the smells of the sea,
but also their inner spiritual
meaning, a devil slipped him
by each arm.

Well. well. well. And Hello
on top of that. said the first
devil.

Greepop them salmonrrom-

Ders.
The man with long crooked

nose giggled. Why here were
those same fine fellows from
the card party, and looking so
dapper too. He burst out lau-
ghing. He laughed out loudand
long and hard, staggering up
and down the beach holding
his sides, breathing in deep
fogs and stuttering out little
heavens. He fell over in the
sand. The second devil took
this a a cue to whip out a
soprano saxophone and dance
by the sea tootling bizarre
squeaks and honks. The other
sat down one large egg- shaped
and smooth rock.

You know, there really isn’t
any sort of preparation you
can give anybody for this sort
of thing, said the first devil,
spitting out crosses on the
beach.

The man opened one eye in
a reverse wink at the devil on
the smooth rock, and was seit
zed again with an uncontroll-
able and hysterical laughter.
He rolled over and over in

'the sand gripping his sides

and shuddering in ecstasy. He
continued in his hysterical

rapture sporadically through-
out the remainder ofthenight.
Occ sionally he would stop
laughing and, in smooth shalt
low breaths, start offtosleep,
With a confusing myriad of
kaleidoscope sounds and visa
ions swirling in his head. But
every time this happened, one
of the devils would start things
up again with one of those in,
credibly funny comments they
were so good at making. It
finally came tothe pointwhero
the man very politely asked
them if they would kindly disr
appear. This was something
they were only glad enough to
do., but they weren't quite as
cooperative as the eye initiai’
1y led the man to believe. In
fact, it was only visibly that
those little devils disappeared
and they still hung around,0ut
of sight, making \vise cracks
and pestering the manwlth the
long crooked nose. Butfinally,
near dawn, he was able to lg’
nore the humorous running
commentary on his thought
processes which they hadbcen
lnterjecting since they had
disappeared from view, ondhc
was able to go to sleep for
short naps between laughs.

His walk in the gardens had
been a pleasant ono,antlcrosr
sing the room, [he man with
the long crooked nose went to
the Window and looked out. His
neighborhood appeared very
peaceful and green. The win-
‘dow in front of him jumped
several small lumps in aniirc
down and away trom him, then
curved slowly in an atctlpancl
away from him He sat down.
The man was slightly peeved.
There was [his difﬁculty with
iiiCSC two devils concerning

when they were going to leave,
and, in fact, whether they
Were going to move into his
home, as well as his head. He
wondered if it Wasn't an act of
unnatural pride to want them
to go. He became actually an-
noyed at this prospect, and
sat staring vacantly out the
window in an irritating con-
fusion.

Psst.

The man blinkedveryslowly.

Psst.

It was the man’s cat calling
him from across the room.
The man rubbed the side of
his nose and looked at his cat.
There was something about
her that made her look very
wise today. He went over to
pet her gorgeous thickcarpet,
and bending over her, he knew
not to resist when she gave
him a funny thousandsrofr
years‘old look. With her front
claws out, she grabbed him
with a terrifying gentleness
by the temples, and, as he
pulled his face down to hers,
the man felt oddly certain
that she was going to say
something to him. In a high
raspy voice that he certainly
couldn't have heard at any
greater distance, she said to
him,

Don’t stick your eyelashes
in my eye.

sounding positively ageless.
Standing up straight he smiled
at her With his eyes, and she
jumped several small jumps
in an are down and away from
him, then curved slowly in an
are up and away from him. As
he sat peacefully down again
at the sunny green window, he
know that the devils were gone.
