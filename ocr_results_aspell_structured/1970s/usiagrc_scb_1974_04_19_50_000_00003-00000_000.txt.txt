Pigs To Roast ll‘l Relays

(The ﬁrst in a series of articles
about the 2d annual Grinnell Re-
lays)

The organizers of the 2d Annual
Grinnell Relays have announced pl-
ans for an expanded program of fun
and frolic accompanied by liberal
doses of Milwaukee‘s ﬁnest bever-
age. This year‘s Relays are slated

for Saturday, May 4 on Ward Field ’

and in the surrounding environs.
Plans include a greatly expanded
program from that presented ayear
ago. In addition to the actual Re-
lays, an outdoor Pig Roast is plan—
ned for the Satruday evening meal,
and an outdoor ﬁlm extravaganza
is scheduled for that night.

The Relays will include several
races in which liouid refreshment

will play a significant role, as well
as ping—pong ball shot~put, pie eat—
ing. pyramid building, egg tosses.
and other events. Jerry Ran-taker oi
Saga Food Service continued that
Saga will put on the Pig Roast in
place of the regular Saturday night
meal. The meal, to he served at
Ward Field, will feature a whole
roast pigs.

The chairman of the Finance Com»
mittee said that the fund raising dr—
ive is still not complete. The Relays
still need approximately $100 to
carry out the day‘s activities.

The chairman said that several
halls have not contributed to the
Relays as yet, and that this is
where the remaining funds must
come from.

by Celestine Bloomfield

I’ve heard from varying sources
that the SPRINGFLING was a suc—
cess. i wouldn’t know. i was too
busy making sure that everything
ran smoothly and of course every—
thing did not run smoothly. Alter
nearly killing a trusty crew oi eight
(over twenty people promisedto help
me decorate), ldiscoveredthotthere .
were nasty rumors going aroundthat
the band had cancelled out. This was
Saturday morning.

On my way to the bus station, I
found out that the band was indeed
on its way, but i kept my ticket
just in case. This hand was already
a replacement for the band that
had «already cancelled on us. ico-
nld write a hook on the million and
one ways to turn down a gig in Grin-
nell, lowa. Cute one liners like,
“Iowa? Where‘s Iowa?” or an out—
right, ‘We're not coming to no
Iowa!” or, “Sure we'll come for
10,000." (Ten thousand?) “Dollars
or course." At this point your me—
mory band supplies you with the
information that this is the same
group that had the $3,500 price tag
last semester. And the heat goes
on, and on, and on,...

Bock in Derby Gym i ﬁnd that the
sound company has iorgotten about
its contract to provide sound at Gr-
innell on April 6. That was enough
to make me fall apart at the seam .
For your general intormation let
me intorm you that we have to rent
a sound system everytime thereis a
concert in Darby.'rhatsound system
comes from Anicom Sound out of
Minneapolis, Mnnesota and to the
tume or 3550. Sometimes we even
have to iork out $200 for a piano
out of Des Moines, because no one
in the music department will coop-
erate. Thank the Lord that we found
a benevolent saint this time.

By this time I have the music,
liquor and decaraﬁo'ls well in hand,
but I’ve got to find a crew to work
that night. Most of all i need some—
one to work the door. it's a lowly
paid job and just as undesirable.
By requesting that everyone have
a ticket 1 can more or less control
the crowd, but we did have some
trouble. The biggest trouble was
Junior l-l‘gh School and High School
students. 1 did put three youigsters
out. Who had purchased their tic—
kets, i do not know. but their money
was refunded. l later caught another
at the beer keg. Campus parties are
or rather should he ofi.limits to
these underage patrons. 1 know that
some of the townspeople have a
lowly opinion of Grinnell College
students. To these parents l most
deﬁnitely urge you to keep your
child at homo or provide other en.
tertainment {or them other than the
Forum or Darby concerts.

i would like to say a tew words
about the clean—up committee. Th—
ere was none. lvly iriends had begun
to avoid me long berore the party
was over. They were afraid that i
would put them to work again. I
had promised the folk dancers that
they would be able to rehearse in
the gym. Suiday morning at 10:00
l was in Darby Gym meaning and
mopping — alone. i didn't realize
the foolishness or this until 12:45.
I dropped what i was doing and left.
By seven Sunday night i had no voi—
ce or strength and it was all i could
do to collapse on the floor near my
bed.

Speaking of folk dancers, they are
not responsible {or the fact that
Captain Beerheert will not appear

on Grinnell’s campus. Not only is
it ridiculous that two mzu’or events
appear right together, but we sim~
ply could not attord it. Stop blaming
the folk dancers and go and enjoy
their concert.

In closing I would like you to stem-
ember this year ior its Although
you may have noticed, a lot of hard
work went into providing you with.
At times i think I should have
blown all the budget on one can--
cert, then I would not have had a
problem of stretching the money
until the end of the semester. 1
would like to see the senior class
Start a fund to raise money to bu—
ild a place that will hold all of the
student body {or a dance or con-
cert. A place with a good sound sys»
tem and good acoustics is deeded
at Grinnell College. I would like
those who complain about notseeing
a Roberts concert to start doing
something about .

KiliC SURVEY RESULTS TOLD

eFM showed that almost 75% of the
students at Grinnell College listen
to the station, but that more than
50% listen for only one hour per

10% of Grinnell’s smdents are lis—

ponding rated the quality of Kate
