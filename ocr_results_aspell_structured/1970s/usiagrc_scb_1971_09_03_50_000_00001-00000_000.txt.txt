full diplomatic immunity.

tition from aTV footballthrila
ler and the Charlie Chaplin
ﬂicks in the South Lounge,
the CHP’AWS Board finally
managed to hold the first of
its regularlysscheduledweekr
1y meetings last Mondaynight.
it was quickly obvious that
SGA President Shelley Floyd
intends to move fast, as she
ripped through a full slate of
discussions and presentations
in about an hour and a half-
in great contrast to the con-
tinuallys dragging Senate meev
tings of the past.

Floyd, Clotlelter Speak 0n Grades, Credit, "liberal Arts”

by John Wylie

Three basic problems should

occupy the attention and en
ergies of members of the
Grinnell community in the
coming yearaccording to Pro-
fessor Beryl E. Clotfelter,
Chairman of the College Fac-
ulty, and Miss Shelly Floyd,
SGA President. In speeches
delivered to the Opening As-
sembly of the college Tuesn
day evening, Dr. Clotfelter
stressed reevaluating the ty-
pes of work for which the cola
lege should give credit and
examining the school’s cur"
rent grading policies, while
Miss Floyd stressed the ne—
cessity of defining exactly
what a liberal arts education
should be.

President Leggett and Prof.
Clotfelter . . .

In his address to the 85*
sembled students and faculty
members, Professor Clot-
felter discussed the history
of the past several years at
Grinnell, and explained that
each change had been made be-
cause of certain assumptions.
He noted that past practices
in the two areas which he
felt should now come under
consideration are also based
upon certain assumptions...
some of them valid and some
of them invalid.

The first set of assumpt-
ions he discussed concerned
why a better education may
be obtained by going to col—
lege than from a privately
organized program of study
and travel. He said that "th-
ere is more to getting an edu-
cation than learning facts,and
the other parts are the re-
sults of human interactions...
enthusiasm can be infectious,
but it is more likely to be
transmitted by the spoken
word than by the written
word.” Dr. C10tfelter added
that a second set ofassump-
tions is needed to justify a
small liberal arts collegelike
Grinnell, since small classes
are not the most efficient
means of transmitting infor
mation. “What we offer that
most large universities cannot
offer is small classes taught
by mature scholars where
questions can be asked, dis‘

cussion can occur, andpapers
can be read by the profes-
sor."

Clotfelter stated that the
new academic requirements
must be considered “some
thing of an experiment" and
that “its success willbe some
indication of the validity of
the assumptions underlying
it." The assumptions under
lying these changes were 1)
“that learningtakesplace best
when it is self motivated."
2) “that students differ so
much among themselves that
no single course or set of
courses can be designedwhich
is appropriate for everyone”,
3) "that no single body of
knowledge is so ‘ important
that every educated person
must know it ,. or at least
that if there is any such body
of knowledge, it has been con
vered before students reach
college", 4) "that college
students are sufficiently mar
ture to accept responsibility
for their own edumtion,
choosing what they want to
learn within the range Ofmat’
erial offered by the college,"
and 5) "that the essentialpart
of the college education is
contact with teachers on a
small group basis. Hence the
requirement of a Freshman
tutorial."

Clotfelter continued that,
”Our practice has been to

. . . listen to Shelley Floyd's
speech.

allow credit only for work
involving verbal manipulas
tion of abstract concepts,"
with only two exceptlDHS’SCi‘
ence labs and art. He noted
that not all liberal arts cols
leges have the same exclur
sions that Grinnell does, and
that those exclusions are con
stantly changing.

Referring to the issue of
grading systems in general,
Cletfelter said that several
assumptions are used to jusn
tify the use of grades: 1)
”that students need and de-
serve evaluation", 2) “that
part of the function which the
college performs in societyis
that of an accrediting inslis
tution" particularly in the
case of graduate schools,
3) "that grades arenecessary

Volume 80 Number 2

Taking over the duties of
what used to be the Student
Senate at Grinnell, the Board
heard reports from various
campus organizations on plans
for this year's activity and
discussed the mechanics of
appointing students to several
committees which still have
vacant positions. The major
position now open is that of
member-at-large of the new
Education Policies Commit
tee, which conducts a con-
tinuous review of the school’s
curriculum. After some de-
bate reyrding the manner of
selection, the Board decided
that an all-campus referen-
dum will be held to choose
the member. Nominees should
apply to the SGA.

Social Plans

Rick Sturgeon and Giristy
Lewis, IMChairmen, briefed
the Board on the types of
IM activities planned for this
year. Many activities as pos*
sible will be co~ed, Sturgeon
said. Individual halls will be
choosing hall 1M chairmen in
the near future, as the foot-
ball season is scheduled to
start in mid-September.

John Kyle of SRC gave a re
port on the recreation acti-
vities planned for the next
few weeks, and notified the
Board that there is a new
bus available for use by SRC
and other campus organiza'
tions taking recreation trips.
Canoeing trips, bike hikes,
etc., will be starting soon.
Social CoordinatorEd Levine
described to the Board in
glowing terms the run of con-
certs planned for the next
few weeks. The philosophy
by which his Social Coordi'
nating Committee operates is
that the students would rather
have a number of small con-
certs, and have something
happening every weekend, than '
have a minimum number of
big names come here andhave
very infrequent concerts.
Some members of the Board
raised objections to this phi-
losophy, particularly since the
activities listed sounded less
than exhilerating to some. X
vigorous degate ensued, many
people talking at once--and'
the decibel level rising in ins
verse proportion to the num-
ber of people listening. Af-
ter several minutes of verbal
exercise, the various parties
subsisted and Levine strolled
out of the room, his philoso-
phy intact.

Budget

During the course of these
reports, some discussionalso
took place regarding the fact
that many of this year’s off-
mmpus residents have no
CHP - AWS representation
since their houses were not
college residences last year.
The matter somehow got lost
in the confusion; hopefully it
will be dealt within the future.
Next week’s meeting will be
held at 9:00 PM Monday. 4
budget meeting is planned for
the near future-ras soon as
the finance committee has
prepared a tentative budget.
