FOG adds computer, drops junk food items

by Trcnn Clelanll
Grinnell's new computerized
identiﬁcation system, a radical
and permanent departure Irom
tradition, is just the lirst step in
“the whole computerization of our
dining system,” according to Food
Service Director David McConnell,
Under the revised plan, which
McConnell developed this summer
with the help or junior Scott Porter,
students will have only one I.D.
cardiand one board number~for
the duration of their Grinnell
careers. Until last year, new cards
were issued to students each year,
and the dining halls used a manual
Check~off system which involved
scratching DH one's board number
on a long number sheet. This
procedure was replaced last year
by an ID. system based on that of
Wooster College. instead ol relying

on numbers, a sticker on the back
of each card indicated the meals
lor which a student was eligible
The cards, which were subjected to
much handling, tended to fall apart
easily and the plan was discon»
tinned.

McCONNELL ESTIMATES that
the computer will save the food
service $2.000 a year, solely in the
cost ol materials (largely film and
laminated paper) necessary to
produce new cards. The computer
will be reprogrammed annually to
accord with students’ changed
board options.

it is highly unlikely that errors
about the status ofone's board plan
will be made under the new
system. If discrepancies occur
between rejected data and a
student's claim, the board number
will be crossschecked manually

with a list from the Registrar’s
ofﬁce.

REACTIONS TO THE drastic
modernization oi the 1D. system
range lrom accusations of “the
beginnings oi an Orwellian State“
to praise for its elficiency Fresh
man Roberta Royal “couldn't
ligure out why that thing ithe

all” her lirst day on campus, and
wondered, “will they search my
purse on the way out?” Royal and
her roommate, Kathy O'Brien,
have since resigned themselves to
the system. “At least the people
who punch in the data are nice. .i
don’t feel like a number because
everything else at Grinnell is so
personal," O’Brien said.

Ren Reed, a sophomore
graduate of the old school of ID.
checking, feels that “this is just so

much red tape to go through. .It
doesn’t really hothcr me, but it
seems like just another step
toward a giant bureaucracy."

criticism by claiming that the only
difference for students is lhat time
and money will be saved.

“It's all in your individual
perception. It you want to view
yourself as a number, that‘s ﬁne
We could go on a name basis, but
that would take more time and
result in Ionger’ lines. I think you
have to. decide that you are still
treated as a person in the dining
room." he said.

THE CONVERSION oi the old
LD. system to the new is only a
shortsrange goal or the come
puterization. A “mediumrrange
goal,” according to McConnell. is
to determine attendance during

certain times of a meal in order to
iudge the amount oi food which
should be prepared. Previously,
attendance records were Simply
estimated and often resulted in the
production of too much or too little
load.

The key long-range goal is to
program all the bids from sup
pliers which McConnell receives
into the Computer in order it) “take
the guesswork out of knowing
precisely where we can get items
of food at the best rates.” In the
past the comparison oi bids was
done manually and involved
countless hours of time and oiten
incurred mistakes. McConnell
estimates that the savings on the
bid analysis alone will cover the

.cost of the two $1,500 terminals.

This Summer. Governor Robert
Ray signed a law that altecls
nearly half of the freshman class.

The law. which raises the legal
drinking age to 19 tclrcctivc July
1}, is aimed at preventing high
school youths from drinking.

Anyone who turned 18 belorc the
measure took effect can still
legally drink but others may find
themselves looking tor away to get
around the law.

TllE CAMPUS PUB, winch is
operated zis a private club, has
already been allccled by the
changed law. Manager Tony
Montoya is now being strict about
who is let in. He says he regrets
turning people away, but points out
that the Pub could lose Its license if
it serves liquor to minors. At the
college, 176 of 403 freshmen find

themselves in that position. and‘

Large numbers create crunch

by Dill! Flynn

Approximately 1,250 students

for 52 students it spells “tem»
porary housing "

The problem. according to
Director oi Housing Susan witt-
perm, has two primary causes
Most importantly, attrition is
down, "This year." Wittpclin says
“we have about 70 more ups
pcrclassmen on campus than we
have had in the past." Also. she
adds. the number of new students
is higher than \\a' expected The
renovation of inlrs Hall. she
says. does not affect the situation.

As a result. Wittpenli has been
forced to squeeze students into
wherever she can filld space Thus.

last year now house students.
Large freshmen doubles and three

four students, respectively. The

several studcnl occupants.

the college contacted students who

Students who never showed up.
Wittpenn terms the situation for
the rest as being "hopelul" but she
adds. “i wouldn't want to make
llny predictions. Sn tar. our
predictions have not been too
good.”

SHE ADDS THOUGH tlial
surprisingly leiv complaints have
been voiced by students ill the
temporary housing, indeed, shc

“ that she has heard un~
conlii-med reports that students

suspects that this is more because
of the roommates than the living

situations,” she points out. “They

The room is carpeted, we've got

it's a good _ l~up. We all like to

students are being patient. and
that cve‘vtlne \\‘lll be in better

She hopes |hat the situation \\ill
not occur again next year "We
have several singles that are large
