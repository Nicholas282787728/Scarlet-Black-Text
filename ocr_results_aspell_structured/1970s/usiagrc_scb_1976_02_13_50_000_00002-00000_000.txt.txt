opportunity to abandon what
Waldo recognizes as the Grinnell
stereotypeAthat of the intellectual
being—and “open up” on a per-
sonal level, Amy Burger expressed
a similar attitude, commenting
that there was really “nothing you
couldn‘t say,”

Topics considered ranged widely
(including Sexuallties and body
language, graltitti, values, smell,
and decisionrrnaking, tor a very
random sampling), and all were
fairly equally acclaimed in terms
of their importance. Judged
particularly striking, however,
was the homosexuality discussion
which brought awareness and
understanding oi alternative
lovestyles.

In addition, the consciousness-
raising exercise conducted

separately by sex was seen as
especially valuable unc~
particularly for the men. Whereas
women seem to have ”gotten that
together on this campus," as
Margie Wekselman observes, men
are not otten afforded the op-
portunity to explore their
maleness. According to Mike
Wiener, the session provided most
men with a feeling of relief and
exhilaration.

workshop dramatically altered
their perspectives on sexuality,
there is probably a good deal more
