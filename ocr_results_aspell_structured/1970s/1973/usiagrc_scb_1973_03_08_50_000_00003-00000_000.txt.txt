KDIC term, and John Hansen ‘was
named the new Chiel Engineer.

ies until next fall, while the new
KDIC board will take office follows
ing Spring break.

In an interview following his ap—
pointment, Wylie said that his plans
for the Scarlet and Black next year
include a possible revision to a
newsmagazine format rather than
the newspaper format typical of the
85th in recent years, and also a
further emphasis on a more jour-
nalistic style of writing,

He stressed the need for more in
depth reporting of broad campus

to assure maximum use oilndividual
Grinnellians’s talents.

Scherler‘ emphasized to the Ser
that he Wants the station to “be-

highly necessary educational re-

administration policy."

The college now operates on abude
get or about $6 million and “any
losses approaching $300,000 are
substantial to say the least,” said
Leggett. Furthermore, because at
the comprehensive charge (tuition,

In the past two years Grinneli’s
black jazz ensemble, more com-
monly known as Mother F, has
gained a lot of recognition. During
the past two semesters Mother F
has performed on several occasions
on Grinnell’s campus and also at
The Number, a Grinnell nightspot.
The versatile eight member jazz
group has also traveled to surrouna
ding places such as Coe College
in Cedar Rapids, la. and Simpson
College in lndianola, la.

On March 10, Mother F travels
to Madison, Wise. {or a one night
stand in a well known night club
there. To top this off, Mother P
will participate in a competitive
jazz testival held at Elmhurst Col-
lege in Elmhurst, 111, from March
16718. Grinnell’s Mother F was one
at five groups chosen to compete
in the jazz combo category out of a
total of 67 entrants,

absorb further increases.

“The total of these charges made
to students accounts for 70 per
cent of the operating budget," Leg—
gett continued, “50 that parents
are obviously carrying a heavy bur»
den of instructional costs. The rest
must be raised in other areas, and
the federal area is. from all the
signs we have now, no longer avail»

Correction

The statement in last week’s 5&5
that consideration of calendar
reform proposals was dropped
“at the suggestion of Dean Waldo
Walker" is somewhat misleading.

Dean Walker says that, at that time,
he tell that the faculty was satis—
tied with the calendar as it stood,
and that there were other issues at
the time which he felt were ofgreater
immediate interest.

However, he stresses that he does
not oppose discussion oi calendar
reform proposals.

time. He described this as “a pol-
itical failure of monumental size”.
The new wave oi political prison—
ers has increased the political cone
sciousness of the prison popula-
tion. Bagdikian attributes situations
such as Attica to this change. Ac-
cording to him, more prison pro-
tests and uprisings occur than the
public knows about.

Bagdikian described Huntington,
where he stayed for a week, as
better than most prisons, but Still
somewhat typical.

”Nothing is the same. The reality
oi normal life disappears, There’s
no reminder.” Another important
aspect is that a prisoner is totally
reliant upon other inmates, They
are the only companionship, and
instructors,

When asked about the solution to
the problems of prisons, Mr. Bag-
dikian could only answer that the
basic reform needed is intne society
that makes these prisoners all pol-
itical prisoners. He said that an end
is needed to economic deprivation
and racism.

Human Sexuality: Awareness

Communication through touch and body movement was the subject
or the opening tilm in last Saturday’s Human Sexuality conference.
A dance therapist explained how her work with normal and dis»
turbed children opened their worlds to emotional contact with an
other person. The lilm set an awareness tor the remainder ol
the dayelong conlerence which incorporated lilms and discussions
into a consciousness~raising experience tor the 85-odd partici»

pants.

Directed by Cay Community Services at Minneapolis, which is
a nonprofit organization sponsored in part by the National Mental
Health Foundation, a group at live men and women led the confer
ence. These included a man and a woman from Gay Community
Services, a woman from the newlyeestablisheg Lesbian Resource
Center in Minneapolis, a drug counselor [or the Public Health

Department, and

a student from the University of Minnesota.

These people served both to stimulate discussions and as resource
persons, particularly with regard to their own sexuality and feel»

ings about same.

Other films throughout the morning and afternoon led to dis-
cussions exploring various themes concerned with sex. The group
members generally agreed that a warm, two—way communication
during lovemaking is a crucial element in a potentially damaging

emotional encounter,

The leader of one of the groups correctly identified a discussion
problem familiar to most of us, that of Grinnell over-intellectual-
izing, and an attempt was made to keep remarks on a personal
context. Most participants felt that, had this been a ground rule
in the groups and had their size been limited, discussion would

have been tar more successful.

As it was, the general function of the group was to raise innum»
erable questions in the minds of the participants, which were
barely tapped during the brief discussion periods. Students telt
overwhelmingly that there was a great deal of potential generated
in many areas by the conference, and are eager to see more ac»

tivites in these areas.

Suggestions to the Sex Education Committee ranged from pleas
for a repeat of the ccnierence so that more of the campus could
have the experience, to ideas about further problems in the areas
of human sexuality. Students felt that continuing, small discussion
groups on both the physical and emotional aspects or sex would
alleviate some of the tensions and ”peer pressure" on campus

regarding these matters.
