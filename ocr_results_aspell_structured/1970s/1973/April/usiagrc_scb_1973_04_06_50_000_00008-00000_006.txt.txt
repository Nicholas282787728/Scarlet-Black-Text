SURBAN STUDIES-

by David Weston

Grinnell College oiiers many diverse our
campus programs 0i the many programs
I had the opportunity to be the first Black
student Irom Gi‘innell to paitlcipate in the
Urban Studies Program It onels interested
in politics oi a large city, Blackrwhlte res
lations, educational crisis, housing, etc.,
then you would be wise to go on this pros
grain. The program entails all oi these
things and more. and it all happens in the
most politically exciting city in the world,
Mayor Daley's Chicago.

While on this program you will havethe
opportunity to do iieltl»wdrk and research
according to your interest or your major,
Political science mayors may be placed
with a law OIIice or firm, Senator's office,
urban planning, etc, or sociology people
may be in community development projects
or rehabilitation and so on, it’s all accor-
ding to what you want and you are almost
guaranteed your choice no matter what
your major,

I had the opportunity 0! working with
Senator Richard Newhouse and his stall.
You become a member of the office, there
{or you are expected to put in as much
work as everyone else. So don’t expect to
go on Urban Studies and relax the whole

Journalism. While working as it freerlance
reporter for Muhammad Speaks newse
pepr, l was given onrtherypb training and
tutoring which complimented the classesl
had taken at Grinnell involving the princi~
pies and background oi the lield oi yournal~
isui

Anolher job I had working in the capacity
oi an advertising counselor {or the Chicago
Tribune newspaper iurnished me with an
abundance ol exposure oi what runningabig
city newspaper is all about. This job also
gave the easy accessibility to the editors
and reporters on the Tribune staii which
proved to he very ploiltable resources in
the writing oi on independent project on the
perspective or the Black Press

Aside lrom my work assignments, I grew
intellectually and spiritually as I learned
more about the economic, political, and
social order of our society As I was able
to tackle and criticize the wrongs OI our
system, i also lound myseliin the position
where I had to devise diiierent alternative
solutions to the problems in order to have
a peace oi mind, This, I ieel, isthe most
rewarding educational experience one can
have when he is put into such a situation
where he is forced to see and deal with
the world realistically, and just by him being
in the center of it all, he isn't allowed to
cop out.

The classroom situation is that of 3 Sem-
inar-discussion type. Many Blacks through
out the city in key positions are visited or
brought in to give talks on their involve
ment or their organizations' involvement
and their eiiect on the city and its people,
especially Black people.

Urban Studies is a very exciting and
awakening program, so muchrthat l ieel
it should be a one year program. One
semester is not enough time to get as
involved as one would like. If you are
interested in people, the wellare oi peo-
ple and yourself, I urge you to check into
Urban Studies. Urban Studies is life and
people and that means you.

URBAN STUDIES -

by Roune Brown

The type oilearning process gained through
experience and exposure and sometimes th»
rough contusion. That’s the best way i can
describe my experience on the Chicago
Urban Studies program last semester.

0! course, such a rewarding experience
isn’t all peachy, that's why l had to inter-
ject that confusion in this learning process
is deilnitely an integral part oi the whole
program. But it's through this contusion
that knowledge, common sense, and exper»
ience is strengthened.

I Incorporated my semester on the Urban
Studies program into a type of internship
which allowed me to receive skills and ex-
perience in my major of Communication/

I can safely say that the Black section
oi the Urban studies program 0! Chicago
provides a rewarding and viably useiul
Black educational experience. The program
examines various levels oiBlack conscious-
ness including one's own philosophies in
terms oi their political, social, personal.
and academic attributes and how they a!-
fect the Black community and the organi—
zations within that community. It also
aids the Black student to analyze his role
in his own Black home and college com-
munities and how those philosophies apply.
It has been my experience to know that
most students on this program leave their
respective colleges within the ACM con-
glomerate in a state oi intellectual pur»
suit, frustration. intuierableness,aczdemic
exhaustion, or because they can no longer
endure the sterility oi the Grinnell-lype
atmosphere. They leave because at theisti-
lation from many of the real facets of the
Black experience so that they come to the
program in ignorance at where they stand
on an individual’s level or where the Black
“Nation" stood. I went for twothings,lirst,
to re-establish my peace of mind but more
importantly to establish my place in the
“Grinnell Experience" in a relaxed atm05v
phere in the midst of a vast reservoir
of independent Black thoughts and actions.
in summary Grinnell College provrdcs
only a limited educational experience for the
Black student so in order to fulfill his
needs he has to consider other avenues
of Blackness.
