Greenhouse Glories

by Sherilyn Lee

Greenhouses are naturally filled
with ovei-benr g, ﬂowerrbearlng
and iIDii-IIC‘ili'il'lg plants, and the
livermotued greenhouse adjoining
the Science Building is no excep-
lion. Yet, Grinnell's greenhouse ho-
uses much more. two orange ch-
eeked Waxhills. one nightingale, two
red-eured wnxliills, and a pair of
"budgies" (otherwise kilownas par-
akeets).

First introduced a year and a hall
ago, as an experiment, ttie orange—
cheeked wnxbills proved to adapt
Very hell to the humid conditions
in the greenhouse, and according
to Dr, Durkee, the birds introduced
aIIer them have adapted eVen las~
ter and more easily.

Presently. the birds all seem to
like the Tamer-end, a tree begun
about ten years ago when Dr. Chris-

Jittot Joins Stuff

Paul Jinot, a native of Saint-Et-
ienne France, has been appointed
to a position as Assistant Prote5v
sor oi rrench, according to Dean
Waldo Walker.

Jitiot, a lather or two, holds den
grees trom the Universite de Lyon
and Brown University, and has held
teaching positions at Brown, Tem-
pie University, and the Phillips
Exeter Academy
He studied French at Pennsylvanr
ia State University under a Ful—
bright Scholarship in 1957, andserr
ved as a Reserve officer in the Frs
ench Navy from I959 to 1961.

In addition to his teaching duties,
Jinot plans to Continue research
into a computer-assisted linguis—
tic analysis or French.

tiansen brought back a seed from
Venezuela in his pocket.

“The birds Certainly seem very
happy here," said Prot. Durkee,
“The tinches always tly together,"
and then he added wIth a gleam
in his eye, “but none oi them have
nested! They were all raised com-
mercially. . . .We Just have to as,
slime they’re miSrsexed!

”We buy them trom a pet shop
in Des Monies whenever we get
some cash," Dr, Durkee smiled.
“They range in price,..the red-ear-
ed waxbiiis were three dollars a-
piece...”

As in most greenhouses concern-
ed with maintaining the balance
in an ecosystem, there is the probe
lem oi insect control Everett Wood,
the Biology technician whom Dr.
Durkee calls “one of the most vale
uable department members”, re-
lated “Last year, some student
brought in a plant with white flies
on it, and we’ve been having prob
lems ever since....Some plants are
more resistant than others. There’s
not much you can do with white
(lies, We sprayed them a little
--something non-toxic. That works
tor a few days, and then they’re
right back again. We don't like to
spray...‘{ou know, they’re on such
an ecology kick here..."

“We navent's used insecticides
for two years," said Dr. Durkee.
”We can’t follow the same things
that commerCial houses do because
oi the variety of plants...Resistant
forms develop ,,andinsecticidesare
dangerous....We’ve tried other met»
hods: We’ve added insects, earth-
worms...The entymology class led
by Dr. Christinnsen often collects
same .We tried a few hundred lady—
bugs a couple of years ago but it
didn't workuqu, Wand washes the
plants and this helps. He also keeps
the plants separaged enough irom
each other to protect them Irom
crawling insects, and he mixes pl-

ants. Planned ecologyntliat’s some
ething that everyone talks about now,
but Mr. Wood came upon that on his
own!”

The birds have even helped in abat—
ing the insect probleml “We coul~
dn’t have had the birds if we used
insecticides," pointed up or. Dur-
kee, “and in tact, they tend to eat
the bad insects.

“But actually," contided Dr. Dur-
kee. “their presence is mainly Ior
pleasure!"

The greenhouse, although officially
considered a collection oi plants
tor teaching purposes and student
projects, is full oi pleasurable p1-
ants. Over the weekend, the Coral
Vine, which Dr. Durkee brought
back trom Costa Rica, began bl-
ooming. “Why, we‘ve had this tor
three years already,” said Mr.
Wood, “and this is the first time
it’s bloomed. on, Dr Durkee was
so happy when we saw them. He
said the tree he got the seeds from
had flowers much larger than these
but I think I rather like them like
this!" And he delicately pointed to,
wards the miniscule, millimeter—
large baby pink flowers.

Forwarded To Trustees

by Kyle Schaub

Alter returning irom mid~semes-
ter break, some Students were pl-
easantly surprised to receive a let-
ter from Curt Gorrell, student re-
presentative to the Educational Pol—
tales Committee, thanking them for
writing letters to the Board oITrus-
tees on behalf of the Communica-
tions department.

These letters, which were written
by majors and nonrmajors alike.
were Xeroxed over break, and now
are being torwarded a low at a
time to the Trustees. It is hoped
that in this manner the Trustees
will then have enough time to read
all of the letters before their up—
coming April 14 board meeting, wh-
en they will decide the iate of the
department.

Although 40 letters have already
been Collected, Gorl'ell has Set the
goal at “100 well-written, sincere

letters from the students to the
Trustees.” If other students are
also interested in expressing their
leelings, such letters should be ad-
dressed to the Board of Trustees
c/o Glenn Leggett, and deposited
in Gorrell’s box to be forwarded.

The Concerned Communication
students are using the letterewrit-
ing campaign to demonstrate actual
student interest to the Trustees
tor the continuence of their depart—
ment, So tar, both the Executive
Council and the faculty have voted
to recommend thedepartment'sdis—
establishment.

President Leggett will carry the
faculty's recommendation and his
own to the April trustee meeting.
What the Concerned Communication
students hope is that there will
also be a stack at 100 letters re-
commending the majors’ position
supported by other students for the
retention ot the department by the
Trustees.
