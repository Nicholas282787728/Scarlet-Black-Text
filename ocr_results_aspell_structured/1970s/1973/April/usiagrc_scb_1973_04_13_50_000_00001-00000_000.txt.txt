Housing Situation
Center Of Debate

by Steve Nunn

About 150 students and iacuity attended Dean Waldo Walker’s open iorum
Wednesday night to dicuss campus security, which was on the agenda,

and student housing, which wasn't,

The discussion about housing centered on a proposal drawn up by Cowles
President Laura David which proposed returning to room draw the rooms
currently reserved for freshmen, house presidents, student advisers,

and black clusters,

The points relating to rooms bios
cked ior ireshmen, house presi»
dents, and student advisers received
little discussion at the meeting.
Most oi the debate over housing
was between those who questioned
and/or challenged the black cluster
system as it is currently adminis

tered and those who supported it.

The basic argument oi those who
Want to return black clusters to the
general room draw was that blocks
ing for the clusters reduced the
choice of rooms available to the
rest oi the campus unduly,

There were some indications that
opponents of the cluster system
would be better satisfied if some
cluster rooms were blocked in some
of the less desirable dorms, such
as Cowles and the Norrises.

The basic position of those who
supported the cluster system as

proposals relating to the hous-
ing problem Wednesday night.

currently designed was that there
were very few rooms blocked off
for it and that it did not reduce
the choice available to the rest
of the campus appreciably.

Some questions were asked about
the viability of the cluster system
in general. Those who opposed it
argued that it aggravated racialtens
sions and diiierences by eniorcing
a degree of segregation.

Those who deiended the system mas
intained that abandonment of the
cluster system was a refusal to re-
cognize the existence ofa problem
that would not go away, even it
the cluster system were dropped,
and that clusters were a valuable
tool in aiding the black adjustment
to the predominantly white value
orientation or the campus.

The meeting was disorderly at ti-
mes, involving a considerable a-
mount ot shouting and emotional

outburst irom both sides. Later
Ms. David dropped unblocking black

clusters from her list of propos-
ed room changes.

Several students, however, includ—
ing SGA President Scott Well, eXr
pressed satisfaction with the meet-
ing because it got out into the open
issues which had not been previ-
ously dealt with publicly.

The debate on housing was pre—
ceded by discussion oi security
on campus.

l‘he current concern apparently is
a result of numerous thefts of Stu.-
dent possessions and of the recent
murder of a University of Iowa
student on the Iowa City campus.

“It’s a terrible mess you’ve got-
ten yourselves into," agreed Pres-
ident Leggett, who said student pr-
essure irom prior years had re-
sulted in a kind of on»campus due
process of law that tied the ads
ministration's hands when dealing
With infractions of college rules or
of the law.

The time was when administra-
tors cnuld expel a Student if they
believed he was breaking the law,
but that time is past,” Leggett

Housing Clarification

by Ellen Yaeknin

Recently, there has been a great deal or contusion and anxiety over the
Black Student Housing proposal. l-lopeiuily, this article will clarify some
oi the issues. The touowing is a summary or what has happened:

immediately aiter spring break, the Black student housing Committee
submitted its proposal for blocked-oil rooms. The Committee had been
asked by the Chairman oi the student Housing Committee, iim Tederman,
to select rooms which would oontorm to the BSHC»proposed black cluster

system.

Tederman and Bob Jacobs, also on the Student Housing Committee, iris
formed the Black Student Housing Committeethat many of the chosen rooms
were not satisfactory for various reasons, andaskedlt to submit a revised
proposali In many cases, Tederman and Jacobs gave black students new
room choices, different from those which had previously been selected,
Many black students were ultimately assigned fourthztnd fifth room choices,

On Monday, March 26, the Student Housing Committeeaccepted the Cluster
system rationale, The speoiiic room proposal, however, was amended to
ensure a more equitable distribution of rooms for 197445. Point 3 stated
that a committee or two Students from the Student Housing Committee,
two students from the Black Housing Committee, and one representative
from the Office of Student Affairs would choose the rooms to be blocked
within each dorm in conjunction with the appropriate House President,
Black students participating in the cluster system would then draw into

these rooms.

on Wednesday, March 28, the Social Policies and Regulations Committee

passed the amended proposal, 5-2-1.

At the Joint Boards meeting that night, a numhel‘of Students voiced
their opposition to the proposal for this year, claiming a dispropor—
tionate number of the best rooms on campus had been blocked off. The
rationale of the black cluster system was passed, 10-24. After much
heated debate, however, the speleic proposal for 1973-74 was defeated,
7-8—3, A motion to invoke point 3 for this year passed, lS-Orl.

Price Rise Hits Forum Grill

by John Wylie
Faced by skyrocketing prices irom suppliers, SAGA Food Service
raised prices on most foods and beverages in the Forum Grill on

Monday

The increase, the first 'since a partial raise in September or
1969, marked the end oi the “dime coke” which had become a Grill

trademark.

Food Service Director Jerry Ramaker explained that, although
prices were raised five or ten cents per item, Grill prices were
still “cqual to or below” prices of any commermal restaurant

in Gi‘innell.

He added that the Forum Grill has been “a consistent loser"
for SAGA, and that the operation had already lost more money
by the end of January of this year than it did in all of 1971—72.
Student reaction to the change appeared to be mixed Some stus
dents threatened to boycott the Grill because of the raises, others
indicated little surprise at themovebecauseofthe widely discussed

rise ill raw food prices.

A tew students complained to the SAGA management under the
mistaken impression that part ot the yearly 3530 board tee paid

by students is used at the Grill.

“Tllzlt's completely wrong —— we don't get any Board money {or

the Grill," Ramaker noted

“And when I told one girl who com-

plained about the real situation, it cooled her on iairly well.“

"You'll hear a loud whoop irom my oiiice if the Grill ever breaks
even Thedaythecrill makesanyproiit is the day I'll start lowering
prices again," Rniitaker concluded.
