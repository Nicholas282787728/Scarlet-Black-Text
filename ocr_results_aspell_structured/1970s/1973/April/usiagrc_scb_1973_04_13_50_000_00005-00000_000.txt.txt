Take A Pill And It Will Go Away

by lack Doppelt

A British scientist recently wrote
in the magazine, New Scientislnbout
a ”boy birth pill" which would as-
sure a 90 percent male birth rate
or better through selective lertili-
zation.

Such innovations have been discus-
sed for years. What is noteworthy
about this article is that the scienr
tist, Dr. John Postgate of Sussex
University, suggested its use as a
method of population control, noting
that a rapid transition to a lemale
minority would he the most direct

route to curbing population growth.
Now I'm not one to question science.

The last time I did, I asked,“I I all
the people were to congregate in one
area on the earth, would the earth’s
rotation be distorted?

And yet, when the realms olsci-
ence, politics, progress, humanitar-
ianism, and common sense collide,
i get very insecure about the sur
vival of humanitarianism and come
mon sense. ‘

Let me elude to a lew pertinent
examples: l

During World War ll, Arthur Com—
pton, one or the scientists engaged
in the Manhattan Project, took a sec-
rct poll among the scientific working
at the atomic energy lab under Stagg
Field as to how the atomic bomb
should be employed Only 15 per
cent voted for full use of the bomb
on the concentrated targets olero-
shima and Nagasaki. Over 70
per cent were in iavor of providing
the Japanese advanced warning or
holding an innocuous test demon~
strating the bomb‘s power to the
enemy. ,

As it turned out, humanitarianism
and common sense were eternally
scarred along with the Japanese.
A few years later, when J, Robert
Oppenheimer, chairman of the At-
omic Energy Commission. refused
to participate in the development
of the hydrogen bomb because at
his impenetrable moral convictions,

_ he losthis government security cle-
arance, was branded a communist,
and was not exonerated until Lyn-

don Johnson acceded to the Presl»
dency.

About live months ago, a "big bro-
ther" system being studied by the
Nixon (i am my brothers’ keeper)
administration's Office of Science
and Technology was disclosed by a
House Committee. The plan boasted
a proposal to put special FM radio
receivers in all homes and cars
so that the government could Come
lnunicate directly with Citizens 24
hours a day and would educate chil»
dren to become good world citizens.
The document did acknowledge that
there may be “some concern about
invasion of privacy,”

But we all know that the governe
ment would never do anything so
inhumanei But, Remember the Ano-
maly! The lamous case ol Buck v.
Bell in 1927 is enough to keep a
cynic like me on his toes when pros
gress steps on them, The Court
sustained a Virginia law allowing
the state to sterilize Mrs. Buck,
a mentally deficient parent or re-
tarded children, On the grounds that
“three generations of imbeciles is
enough” as Justice Oliver Wendell
Holmes put it. He rationalized that
if a government could dralt young
men to defend their country and pose
sihly die, then it could sever Fallo-
pian tubes with no compunction at
all.

By such distinguished logic, ii the
government can still draft young
men, then i see no reason why it
can’t impose selective fertilization
to control population growth, Just
to make the question less remote,
let us suppose that the government
is not as imperious. Let us suppose
that it merely permits the use hi
this “boy birth pill.” '

Now, we have a similar scenario
to the recent Supreme Court deciSr
ion on abortion. The decision is left
entirely to the person taking the
pill. The government should guaranr
tee certain zones of privacy. ll
popular sentiment about population
control were heightened enough, it

Alston: Freedom

To the Editors:

My immediate response to son’s
recent editorial was to reflect on
the infantile nature of many of the
students I come in Contact with on
Grinnell's campus. I, afiablack man,
felt very offended when these studen-
ts are given the opportunity to play
the petty political games with the
destiny of black folks as their father
are now doing,

Then, too, Ireflect on the desires
of this student body to legitimate
Gay and lesbian activities on this
campus. How can people of such
moral deprivation dictate what is
good and bad for black people?

i am firmly committed to acquir—
ing the political ireedom of black
people so as to achieve a moral
freedom which is free from theper-
versitles of a degenerate mentality,
I feel the cluster system is one step
toward achieving this moral and
political freedom, and another step
toward solidilying the black come
munity.

loddengaard: Ego

To the Editors:

Gregg Dallner’s recent column,
”Micky Spillane--I the Jury” he dis-
plays more clearly than usual his
narrow minded egotism,

Moral absolutism, which Mr, Daff-
ner praises so highly, has been one
of the most destructive forces in
history, It has been responsible for
the Crusades, Nazi Germany, the
Mid-East Conlllct, and the Korean
and Vietnamese Wars. It’s fine to
kill people it they are evil, and, or
course, God is on our side. Conllicts
do not occur in black and White,
but in grey vs. grey, Good and Evil
are ligments ol one's imagination.

Furthermore, he viciously attacks
everybody who does not idolize Spil-
lane’s violent, sexist hero, Mike
Hammer. Although there clearly
is a gull between the moral absol-
utist and liberal intellectuals. there
is no justification in calling the late
depraved, cruel, corrupt, and lm»
moral. This type of attack is just
another example of destructive
moral absolutism.

Perhaps if people like Mr. Duffner
were more tolerant of other peoples
ballots and lilestyles, they might
lind that ”happy endings" canoccur
without one side being destroyed.

Tom Loddengaard

llld shed their “Victorian social
concern” about leaving conception
to the grand conceiver, anti slamo,

“congratulations, it’s a boy "

In Justice Blackmun’s decision iii
the abortion case, he stressed that
”modern medical techniques” had
a strong influence on the Court’s
judgment. it is preciselythe infinr
its scope ul scientinc progress
that, l think, introduces a pl'ovoce
alive twist to, specilically, the door
tion ruling and, there broadly, to
the question of the hazards of sci-
once.

The era when scientists could just
experiment and discover without
mural restraints had eclipsed with
World War II, if not sooner And
yet, in light of the abortion decision
sanctioning sell-judgment, can scir
ence and society be anymore secure
about the humanitarianism and com-
mon sense of each individual? Or
will “millions leap at the opportun-
ity to breed male?”

Making

by Jim Alt
In case nobody noticied, it has been
quite a while since I wrote a col-

umn, since belore Spring break,
intact.

My only excuse is the extraore
dinary amount oi psychic energy
which one burns in making a “life-
decision", the kind that cannot be
reached without lirst asking "What
the hell am i doing with my lilo?
what the hell do i WANT to do with
it?" seniors. at least, should know
what I mean.

Those sorts oi questions are not
much fun to wrestle with, and like
most people I avoid them until con-
fronted directly, lmean, ”free'will”
looks good on paper, but it is pain-
lul to exercise. And introspection
may be a stock-in-trade at Grins
11911, but I sure hate to ACT upon
it.

Actually, I had a lairly easy life-
decision, a choice among three dis~
creet alternatives. The rational ape
proach to such a choice ls to Come
pare the advantages and disadvane
tages of each possibility in view or
a set at goals and to pick the most
attractive alternative.

On a more complex level this means
assigning a weight to each relevant
criterion of chOice, gathering infor»
mation about the alternatives and
scoring each on these criteria, and
picking the alternative with the grea-
test welghted total score, The nos
tion can be further refined by assi»
gning probabilities to the inevitable
elements of uncertainty within the
alternatives

You can take my word, as a some-

times—econo ist, thatsucllruleslor
rational deci ion-making are easy to
devise and difficult to argue with,
They put a shiny gloss over the tact
that some value system -- some
philosophy _. is needed to assign
weights to decision critleria; and
that philosophy itself must ultimr
ately extend beyond the reach at
human reason,

This fact, coupled with what eco-
nomists call “imperfect knowledge"
7— and what i must call Grinnell’s
unsatislactory preprotessionul co»
unseling system .. led me to make
an essentially nonrational (not “ir-
rational”) decision on the basis of
very little inlorination and in the

Professor Charles Beye of the Boston University department of Classics
Spoke in the South Lounge last Wednesday on the topic 01 ”Women in the

Homeric Epic."

The life Decision

lace bl great uncertainty, , or in Mr
her words, the usual sort ol human
decision.

I! you do not agree with these ob-

servations, you must by now think
me contused and possibly a bit stu-
pid. Even il you understand whatl
have said, you must ask how one
goes about living with the results
at a nonrational decision, ,.a guess,
actually.

Most people are skilled atconstru-
cling a plausable rationale alter the

fact,
quite convincing themselves W that

the decision was in some sense
“correct”. Given sometime, 1 im-
agine that I too will develop a ra-
tionale that is satisfactory to those
who demand reason, or atleaslrea-
sons.

As for myself, 1 am not unhappy.
l at least thought about the impor-
tant facets and implications of the
alternatives ,, after all, that is what

convincing others H il not ,

sleepless nights are all about, The
decision that finally popped into my
head (seemingly of its own volition)
and announced “THIS is what you
want,” although not rational in an
expressible sort ot way, is nonethe-
less one with, which l can live in
peace.

And perhaps that feeling springs
less lrom my beliel in the decis-
ion’s quality -- its “correctness"
-- than from the fact that it is MY
choice. I have nobody to blame, or
to thank, for its consequences but
myself. I alone am responsible, and
at least I can BELIEVE that I am
right.

Somehow, it seems to me that just
having a choice to make, while ne—
cessarily prior to making a choice,
is also more important. For given
uncertainty in life, wouldn’t you
rather take your chances with a
choice that is your own than with
one that is not”

lEAP: A Cheerful End

by Fran Cutler

Professor Ken Christiansen, the
current director or LEAP, announr
ced last week that the interdisciplin-
ary LEAP program will be termini
aled at the end of this semester.
The reason for this action, Mr,
Christiansen explained, is that the
LEAP program has succeeded in ful-
filling its major goals and institu-
tionallzlng its major functions in the
community,

From the time of its inception th-
ree years ago, LEAP was designed
as a pilot study directed toward
the assessment and abatement ofen—
vil‘onmental pollution and naturair
resource wastes lnlhe first semesA
ter, participants 'Sifled through and
weighed all ol the garbage produced
by the college, in an attempt to ids
entify and measure the effluents pmr
duced by the college In subsequent
semesters, LEAP formulated action
proposals for the abatement ofthese
effluents and began work on them.

A partial list ofLEAP’s wide range
of activities include the establish
merit ol u paper recycling program,
a chartered bus and a ride board,
a one and one hall year study olheat
energy use resulting in a proposal
to decrease heat energy, the organi~
zation oi Earth Day celebrations, an
analysis of and general publicity
on the phosphate content or major
laundry detergents, publication of
the EcoeAction Handbook, n contin-
ued investigation of the leusibilily
of can and bottle recycling, tllelllstie
tutlon of lhe use of health foods {It
Saga, and the retnhlcttlug of paper
for sale in the Book Store.

LEAP also administered a Com-
munity survey with the generousaid
of the Gi'lnllell Lion‘s Club, the re~
stills of which have led Io Ii solid

waste proposal for the town oiGrin»
hell to be presented to the city coun»
cil. Most important however,
LEAP’s presence has promoted a

We Eco-mt

general awareness ofenvironmental
problems, an awareness which has
manifested itself in the increase in
dormitory solid waste outputand in
the increase in the use ol recycled
paper and of returnable containers
on campus. In the last year LEAP
has been analyzing erosion and the
associated water pollution in the
Rock Creek Lake watershed,andhas
been studying the effectiveness of
the community’s water recycling
plant.

Although the LEAP pilot study will
olliciolly end this semester, its
programs will be continued. LEAP
has made an attempt to institution»
aiize its programs into the struc-
tures oi the student and city govern-
ments, assuring that its activities
will be continued Thocampuspaper
recycling operation has been insti—
tutlonallzed undertheausplces olthe
SGA, and beginning next year the
city council has promised to take
over the town newspaper recycling
operation. Mr. Christinnsen has
promised that he would sponsor
willingly any independent project on
environmental problems He has
urged that Students uilll these in»
tel‘ests become involved In ISPIRG,
PACE. the Sierra Club or the Alid-
obon society,
