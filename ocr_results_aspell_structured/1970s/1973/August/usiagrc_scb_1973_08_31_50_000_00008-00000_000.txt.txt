.NCAA Adopts

by Dave Cotvert

KANSAS CITY, MO The National
Collegiate Athletics Association's
Baseball Rules Committee has offi-
cially adopted both the designated
hitter rule and aluminum hat as of
the 1974 season.

According to Dick Siebert, secre-
tary—editor oi the Rules Committee,
"the designated hitter rule will ess—

‘ elitially be the same as used by the
American League. The only differ
ence in college ball next season is
that the pitcher can also‘ be the
designated hitter,"

The aluminum hat option was app—
roved by the Committee by a unar
niiuous vote.

Although Grinneli is a member'm
the NCAA, the new rulings may not
apply to Midwest Conterence plays
Athletic Director and baseball coach
John Pfitsch told the S KL B earlier
this week that the Midwest Confer
ence baseball coaches met in Nov—
ember, and that at this time the
question will be discussed and pro-
bably resolved. When asked {or his
own opinion on the issue, Piitsch

- Commented, ”Now I'm a purest in
baseball and I'd probably vote a,
gainst the designated pinch hitter."
He added, however, that the desig-
nated hitter rule would allow more
players to get in playing time. As
tor the question or aluminum bats,

Plitsch, predicted that the dominant
point of consideration would be (is
nancial. Grinnell isn’t the only schr
001 with economic woes. '

Ask anybodyabdutlastyear scross
country team and you'll get the ans-
wer, “Injuries." Only two runners
on the team escaped injury and they
were superstar Dan Hildebrand and
“Most Improved" Bob Brown. Uilr
fortunately, neither runner will be
here this tall. Somehow, however,
there ‘is an air of confidence on the
squad. Coach Obermiller is also
quite optimistic and is looking ior-
ward to a good year.

Juniors Dave Raul), Bob Shields,
and Tom Howlanti should carry the
bulk of the work. Raub had a knee
injury for most oi last year, but
in outdoor track he was making res
markable progress and should be the
number one runner. Shields ran well
last year despite an illness during
mid-season. Howland had mono last
season but iinished the year quite
strong.

The remainder of the varsity should
be made up of sophomores Mark
Blanchard, Frank Morton, Russ Da-
mtott, Paul Kennedy and treshmen
Cliiiord Cusin and Judah Garber.
