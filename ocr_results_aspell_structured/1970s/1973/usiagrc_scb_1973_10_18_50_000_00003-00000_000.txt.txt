Rothenhetg: the Price of Being Chicken

To the Editors:

when you were a kid, what was
the Cheapest meat available? Chick,
en. And now that you're a fullr
rledged adult (well, almost-»you can
vote and drink but cannot help go»
Vern Grinnell), what is still the
cheapest meat, 'if any meat may be
called cheap these days? Still chicks
en.

The next question you may ask
yourself is: what meat does SAGA
serve in the smallest quantities?
The answer again is chicken, Leave
ing aside the barbecued chicken
of Saturday nights, since that is
usually the time for unusual entrees,
an astute observer might notice
that SAGA hardly ever serves that
leathered bird that has oftentimes
been the mainstay of protein for
people who must keep theirfood bills
to a minimum. The next question
might easily be; Why???

The answer lies in SAGA Dave’s
honest explanation. Chicken is just
too popular; we eat too much of it
when it is served. We eat so much
chicken, in fact. that SAGA finds
it more economical to serve us
beet which we will consume in much
smaller quantities but which is

much ‘more expensive.

There is a lesson to be learned
lrom all of this, believe it or not.
There are certain meats which we
all abhor, such as mystery meat
and those hamburgers (even my cat
won’t eat them-400 much“filler”).
Contrary to popular opinion, there
ls a way to force SAGA to change
its serving habits, thus enhancing
our Own eating habits All we have
to do is consume enormous amounts
of whatever we really detest and
SAGA will have to substitute some
other (hopetully more palatable) food
for it. Who knows? Maybe We could
even bring back chicken.

or course, there is one danger in
this master plan: the Health Center
would probably be swarming with
tomain cases within a few hours
after the plan went into effect.
How much mystery meat or how

,many hamburgers can one stomach

deal with, after all! But one must
make sacriﬁces for The Movement:
one must sacrince one’s present
health for the future culinary good
of the entire college community.

Tenders. Yacknln

i would like to take this oppor-
tunity to thank the laculty forteach-
ing me one oi the most valuable
lessons 1 have learned since coming
to Grinnell more than three years
ago, It’s incredible to me that i
could have believed such a myth
for so long, but rm willing now to
admit my toolishness: l actuallybe-
lieved that grinnell college was
more than a‘hardened, conservative
institution; I believed that it was a
dynamic, forward-thinking, and con
cerned community, whose members

'actually cared about the problems

and frustrations of the various cone
stituent groups! Today’s vote at the
laculty meeting, which eiiectlvely
vetoed purposeful discussion about
the problems or students in gover
nance among the members of the
”Community" and which simultan—
eously denied that any problem exv
isted really jolted me. It shouldn’t
have. i knew that Mr, Wall’s propo-
sal was going to fail, but my prob
lem, I suppose, was that I wanted
so much lor it to pass that I can
vinced myself that the [acuity would
be convinced ol the necessityiorthe
independent commission.

Thank~you, Grinnell faculty, for
teaching me that even at a small
institution like Grinnell the realir
ties of politics and power are more
important than the ideals of shared
experiences, shared mistakes, she
ared successes, and shared learn
ing. I had mistakenly thought that

Grinnell would be able and willing
to transcend some of the realities
of the “outside” world to actually
transform some 01 the ideals into
realities, it only on the scale of a
small Midwest college community.
But ideals cannot even be amended
when those in control reiuse to talk,
and you have decided that it is not
worth it to talk. (Don't forget: the
Executive Council and the Faculty
Organization Committees are clo-
sed, studentrless committees; what
kind of discussion is reallypossible
within those committees?) Maybe
you were doing all of us “idealist”
students a favor by voting to ige
nore us; it probably would llavehurt
worse (although it’s hard to see
how) it you had established the com
mission only to anticipate turning
down whatever proposals came out
or it, But to presume that is only
to presume that any proposals would
have been against college interests,
and the obvious analogy to such a
presumption is the declaration of
guild without the proof. (One rhee
torical question; do you equate “coir
lege interest with "faculty inter
ests”’.’).

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK OCTOBER 18, 1573 PAGE THREE

The question which still remains
is, ”Where do we waning ldealists
go from here?” As members of
Dean Walker's Plant Physio,
logy class suggested, maybe we are
being silly by playing our little
games. perhaps it’s time to stop.
We’ll stick to things like deciding
when the next SAGA fast will be,
and deciding what dorms should be
coed, and leave the “touchy” areas
of academics alone. After all, geta
ting involved in academic policy-
making involves an awlul lot of
responsibility, and as the Executive
Council mandate stated rather per-
emptorily, “students,..are not to be
held responsible for their results
(those or academic policy deter
mination).”

i can’t accept such an end. Be—
cause my primary concern while at
college is academics, l disagree
with the Plant Plinio class that
getting involved with academics is
merely “playing games." But I'm
still lett without an answer to my
question: “Where do we go trom
here?H Perhaps there is nothing
left for Grinnell students to do 1
believe that the question will ul-
timately have to be faced by the
faculty once again, but by then, it
may be too late. institutions which
manage to survive are those which
adapt to new and changing situations.
Unless Grinnell is willing to con-
tinuously examine itself with a view
towards adapting, Grinnell’s insti-

tesson’ .

tutional shell will survive, but its
history or progress and concern will
certainly die, ,

And I don't think that this pros-
pect is just bitter speculation. SevA
eral students came up to me after
the meeting today and told me that
if they knew before they came what
they know now about Grinnell, they
wouldn't have come. I understand
what they are feeling, even it the
faculty refuses to understand. But
the faculty’s refusal to listen may
become a moot point. For pretty
soon the intelligent, concerned stu-
dents are going to stop talking and
pleading and begging to be heard;
pretty soon they’re just going to
stop coming to Grinnell, only to be
replaced by students who don’t give
a damn about academics When this
happens, the laculty will have only
themselves to account for the meta-
morphosis.

One final comment: A few weeks
ago, i was explaining to a trustee
of Grinnell what had been going on
concerning the debates overgovern-
ance. Whe I told him that i didn’t
think that the faculty was willing to
talk to us, he laughed and said,

“Oh. come on. What kind of file
culty would refuse to listen to and

talk with its students? Isn’t that
part or their ion?” at least now
i don’t have to answer him. You,
Grinnell faculty, already have.

Alumni Decry Executive Privilege

To the Editors:

As Alumnae of Grinnell College,
we read with dismay the article
concerning the deplorable actions
ol son VicerPresident John Potts.
it is a shame that such trivial
incidents at Grinnell continue to
make such a splash in the Des Moir

'nes press. The entire incident, hDWr
_ ever, shows the extent of Grinnell

myasma; orinnell students in gen
oral and son oiticers in particu-
lar often tend to lose a sense oi
perspective,

We could not help but notice the
parallel between this incident and
the events in Washington concerning
VicesPresident Agnew. In light of
Agnew’s recent resignation, thenext
logical step is for, John Potts to fol-
low sult (a laudable course, in our
opinion).

Why not just forward a transcript
of the whole affair to Eugene lone-
see; he alone could appreciate it
for what it is»-absurd,
