Candy Huggins: Help Here

by Devon Griffith

From some trained counselors, one
might tear an unbearably soupy strr
ing oi standard phrases and condoe
lences. But talking with Candy Hag-
gins, resident adviser ior Clark and
Norris halls, is a simple, “nOrnon-
sense” experience. She is quite un-
aiiected and extremely candid.

All the Same, she is quitethoroughr
ly trained as apsychological counse-
lor. At Southern Illinois UniverSity,
she iirst received her BA in Eng
lish, but also included several psy-
chology courses. Later, at thesame
school, she Obtained an MA degree
in counseling psychology, in this'
phase oi her training she grew more
experienced in clinical counseling--
now the realm of her greatest in—
terest.

liaggins_irankly admits that her
choice at Grinnell ‘Was an “aces
ident." "That was the first place
that asked me to come for an
interview ,. and I needed a job "

We Bombed In Grinnell

by Toni Knapp

11' last week’s faculty colloquium
was an indication of things to come,
perhaps we should run cartoons
instead. it wasn't the worst public
exhibition; i heard Norman Mailer’s
party was a bigger bomb. rrom
viewing the list of lecturer’s, this
columnist expected something akin
to a John Birch critique of the
communist party. Alas, at least
that Would have been interesting.
instead, we were subjected to two
hours Dijon-event, highlighted by
a stupendous display oi trivia, Vir»
tually none of the important ramifir
cations of Watergate were touched
in any detail.

Mr. Wall’s explanation of the hist-
orical precedents, as far as they
went, was at least iniormatlve, it
not always topical, However, all
through his analogy oi the Jeffer-
son, Hamilton, Burr aiiair, i had
a sneaking suspicion that he would
culminate it by mentioningthedeadr
ly Hamiltoanurr duel as some sort
of lesson: Perhaps Nixon and Ervin
could go at it on the mall, but
Nixon would probably have the guns
iixed, anyway. Instead Wall simply
wasted ten minutes calling Nixon a
crook, something he could have done
in a sentence.

Mr. Grey spent a good deal ot his
time vainly attempting to prove he
had a different opinion, It turned
out to be about as important a diii.
erence as exactly how many angels
will‘ fit on a McGovern button. If
that is the best this campus can do

for diversity oi opinion, maybe we’d
better open a Grinnellaln-Athens,
or a Grihnell-inrMoscow program.
Grey's point that Watergate might
have helped weaken the executive
was hardly startling, liis opinion at
programs that whould be enacted
while Nixon’s out ior the count, was,
however. Even McGovern eventually
backed down on the thousand dollar
a year scheme. Grey could have at
least done the same. ‘

ii the elections last year proved
anything in‘electing an unpopular

Rhelonic . ..
Unlimited

president in the middle oi a warand
a scandal, it was that the people
did not want McGovern’s programs,
Grey did not attempt to prove that
the country (you remember, all those
hicks without the beneiit oi Grinnell
education, just waiting iorour grad-
uates to tell them what to do) had
changed its mind. To say thatMr,
Grey's talk smacked of at least the
ilavor oi elitism is to put it mildly

Mr. Jones, perhaps, addedthe most
in his analysis of the eiiect of the
Watergate abroad At leastit was re-
ireshing in that it was the type oi
lecture which attempted to shed

some light on the question,

If the lecture part oi the program
accomplished nothing, the question
and answer period proved concluSr
ively the banality oi the evening.
One interesting point oi constitutions
al law as to whether Nixon could be
prosecuted beiore being impeached,
was quickly lost in an ivy league
inside joke. ‘

To top the program on, we heard
a closing remark that Watergate
was a very “Republican" thingtodc.
The point, while iloating in its

author's ideological prejudices,was .

apparently that the money ior the
Republicans encouraged the illegal
activities, and somehow that is unir

one to Republicans. lf Watergate,

proved anything, it is that these
things are strictly byrpartisan Cerr
tainly American Airlines wanted
something for their money, butto use
a local example, I really doubt that
East Coast unions gave thousands
to the lows Democratic Senate nomir
nee out of the kindness of their
hearts. In addition, the kind of po-
litical espionage, as was mentioned
by another panelist, was in no way,
limited to one party.

it Thursday’s showlllustrated any
thing it was that an issue as well
known as Watergate makes a poor
topic oi discussion, especially in a
potentially closed community such
as Grinnell, We can only hope that
the idea of colloquims, which is good,
is transformed into better realities
in the future, both in the nature of
the discussion, and in the differences
oi opinion among the participants.

Richard Nixon: Superstar

by J. c. Woods

There is no doubt in my mind
Richard M. Nixon has to be the
greatest President in the history
oi the United States! Why, you ask?
Because he has endured more pain
and humiliation for his country than
any other President in American
history. And to what end was this
endured?

in order to bring the American
people to a new and greater era of
glory; to return to the ilabby Amer
ican mind, rotted by Roller Derby
and ieminine hygiene spray comm-

ercials the magic ingredient that,
made the dreams of Manifest Des-

tiny reality, The mystic quality that

will return us to the top or the heap.
I’m talking about CHARACTER.

First, Mr. Nixon did not allow
us to turn tail and run from Viet-
nam. Character demands patience,
and Vietnam taught us patience
We had to have peace with honor
(or to be more accurate, pull out
with honor). Why, you ask” Because
to allow America to give up a
fight in utter Surrender would have
been demoralizing, The people at
the Pentagon would have cried ior
days. The ammunition manuiactur-
ers would have cried for weeks. The
peoplein the Ghettos would have
cried ior minutes(to welcome home
their murderer-junkie sons) No,
we must have peace with honor.
Face must be saved.

The Watergate is so contrived
that it is obviously a Presidential
plot to develop our inner resources.
Nixon was, by all polls, going to
win the election handily His aides
had no real tears from McGovern,
Why would anyone spend money
they could so easily embezzle? (Mr.
'ocan proved how easy it was to
rlproff CREEP). Notice the name oi
the Presidential re-election commie
ttee (CREEP). Even it has villanr
ous connotations. The President has
built a web of guilt which lorces even
his staunchest supporters to pragr
matically examine their govern
ment.

Mr. Nixon, by using ii brilliant
combination of export-economlcpo»

licies has helped to relieve a pamv
pered American oi its vanity and
weakness. A iew short years ago we
were the great superpower who each
year spent a quarter of its wealth
trying dilligently and vainly to ieed
the world (and the rest in an equ-
ally dilligent and equally vain att-
empt to blow it up), Now we are
stuck with eating grilled peanut

Not much, though.

, Mr, Nixon has served us well
He has drunk Of the bitter Vial,
donned his crown of thorns, and
borne his cross with all the turtle
tude that has made America great,
and from what l heard onthe streets
all summer, he will soon reap his
reward. The Pope is getting his
best robes dry—cleaned in order to
prepare to start proceeding tor the
first Quaker ever to beCANONIZED,

Furthermore, she appears to have
suffered a case of the “WhatrAm-
I-Doing-Here Blues.”

Many ireshmen would probablyun»
derstand Candy’s initial depression
when she first began at Grinnetl,
She worried that perhaps she had
made the “wrong choice" incoming
to the college, Although she did
grow more “satisiied” here, she
nevertheless has her reservations
about the Suitability of this job {or
her. Other employmentpossibilities
'might have included both more ace
tual counseling and greater (inane
cail reward, she says.

Haggins says that the role oi the
EA at Grinnell is but dimly delined,
“This is more a Situation of pub-
lic relations than oi counseling,”
she explained, Throwing parties and
studyrbreaks, as well as tacking
the right names on the right iaces
are among her iunctions--all eiiorts
to keep the dorm socially comforr
table.

But there is some counseling here
ior Haggins, ior which she seems to
have enormous enthusiasm. She desV
cribed with animation the various
types oi counseling she iinds most
often here. First, she said that
there is the academic type ohcoun-
seling, ior which she usually reiers
the advisee to his or her adviser,

Other students, knowing that she
is employed part»time at the Ca-
reer Services Office, seek vocation»
al aid irorn her. A third group or
Grinnellians come in for the "light
rap” type of service.

"These are not the kids that just
come in and say, ‘Hi, I have pros
blem.’ ”, she elucidates. They Ot—
ten initiate a general conversation,
during the course of which some die
fiiculties that the student is having
may be illuminated. Finally, there
IS an occassiohal opportunity for

what Haggins terms “in-depth coun-
seling" . lnl such a case, the pro-
blem is usually presented directly
and immediately,

in advising, she draws upon both
her training and her intuition. "I
have a pretty strong intuition,” she
asserts with a knowing Smile. Added
to intuition and training, she bel-
ieves that sensitivity, empathy, and
a sincere concern for others are
essential traits for an adviser, She
recalls that even in grade school,
iriends frequently came to her with
their problems.

Unfortunately, she feels, many
trained counselors “don’t give a
damn.” Many will say, “Yes, I
know what you mean,” but actually
they do not. She added that some»
times people who abound in goodi
characteristics for counseling do a
better job of helping others than
those who are formally trained to do
so.

“i won’t spend another year in
the residence halls," Candy main-
tains when asked about her plans
tor the iuture. She longs ior a men
“structured” counseling. situation.
She does not, however, exclude the
possibility oi counseling ior a col-
lege in an off-campus setting.

Thoughts ion Privacy

by Michele Rothenburg

In the past iew years I’ve heard
many complaints about people study-
ing or talking about studying all the
time, Although this problem is so-
metimes in the mind oithe observer
it is more often due to the priva-
tistic attitudes held by many college

are very similart their parents
and other elders W cm they often -
criticize.

One aspect of this conflict is that
although students are supposed to
have idealistic ideas about education
and the importance of interaction
they‘ seclude themselves to work

’Round the Clock

 

students, Although this privatism is
evidenced by the amount at time
spent studying, it has also been re-
cognized in attitudes toward the
”Outside World.H

In a national poll oi college senr
iors done a few years ago, Jeff,
rey K. Hadden and CRM, inc. iound

that “Privatism’s idealogy is ale,

truistic, for it acknowledges the prie
vileges oi private existence—as rim
ghts to all men. But in practice
thi true concern for others is
diametrically opposite to the ethic
of privatism at its logical extreme-e
selfrindulgence...” Essentially,th-

' ey concluded that although students

seem to have a clear picture of
society and are idealistic about the
way it should be, their actions

most oi the time. One student re-
cently remarked that “Outside oi
school, work usually involvesinter-
acting with other people, but at
school people tend to close them<
selves off in order to work."

Many times I’ve talked with people
stunned by the iact that they could
not find one iriend to talk with dur-
ing a particularly diiiicult period.
“It’s unnatural to study as much
as some people do around here”
complain some. On the other hand,
many students would agree that
people should have the right to
study as ,much as they desire. it
seems that there should lie some
point at which the right to privacy
ends and other altruistic ieelings
reside.
