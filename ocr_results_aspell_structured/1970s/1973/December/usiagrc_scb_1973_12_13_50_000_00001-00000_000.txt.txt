THE ERINNEIJI: SE‘HRIJET 8i BUTT-2K

VOLUME 32, NUMBER 15

The theit late Saturday oia maSr
ter key to all North Campus resi-
dence halls neccessitated the re-
placement Tuesday 01 3’16 locks.

Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn
estimates that 550 students live in
the eight residence halls affected.

Dean of Student Affairs Jim Ted-
erman said the key was returned
anonymously late Tuesday. The key,
which had been taken from the room
of an unidentified Resident Adviser
sometime Saturday, was slipped unr
der the door of that Ra’s room Tue
esday.

Hawn emphasized that the return
of the key did not alter the neces-
sity oi changing all the North Cam-
pus locks. He noted that it would
have been possible to have the key
copied under certain circumstances,
although he would not speculate as
to whether this had been done.

Saturday

College officials first learned of
the miSSing key from the Resident
Adviser late Saturday evening,
Meeting Sunday, they determined
that the key had probably been stolr
en, and that it would be necessary
to immediately replace all locks
on North Campus.

Hawn flew to Minneapolis late
Sunday, and spent the next 24 hours
supervising the manuiacture oi 376
lock cores and 752 keys at the Best
Lock Company plant there.

Meanwhile, students were advised
of the situation Sunday through their
house oiiicers. They were cautioned
to take special precautions to pro,
tect valuables until new locks could
be installed.

Students on many residence ﬂoors
instituted informal agreements to
insure that the floor was not left/
unattended irom Sunday through Tu—
esday.

Tederman announced Monday in a
letter to the student body that the
theit had necessitated the replace-
ment oi North Campus locks, and
that a deposit system was being in-
stituted to insure better key control.

This year, keys will be issued un-
der a “negative deposit” system.

9 COMMITTEE

MAILRISES

WASHINGTON, D.C.~Although
members of Iowa’s congressional
delegation report a drop in mail on
the issue of whether or not Pres»
ident Nixon should be impeached,
the House Judiciary Committee res
ports its mail count is Climbing,
A spot check December 5 showed
hat the Committee received 800
letters on the issue that morning.

To date, the Committee has re,
ceived 180,000 letters favoring imr
peachment and 11,000 letters show»
ing some degree of support for
Nixon.

In contrast, First District Con-
gressman Ed Mezvinsky (Dela) is
receiving ten to iiiteen letters perl
day supporting the impeachment in-l
quiry, and one or two per day sup ‘
porting the president.

Mezvinsky is a member oftheJud
iCIary Committee, which has the dut
of determining whether impeachr
ment proceedings against the Pres-
ident will be instituted.

which means that students who fail
to return keys at the end oi the year
will be assessed a $5 fine, Failure
to pay the line will result in holding
up transcripts and/or registration,

Tederman explained that the sys-
tem was necessary to provide an
incentive for returning keys at the
end oi the year, and to protect re—
sidents of all halls on campus, since
each room key opens all outside
doors to all residence halls.

Hawn estimates that the rush re
placement job cost the College abr
out $1800. However, Tederman said
Tuesday that it had already been de
cided to replace the entire North
and South Campus lock system H
a job that has not been undertaken
in at least twelve years, according
to Hawn.

An exact timetable for replace-
ment had not been determined at
the time the key disappeared.

Distribution

Workmen installed the new locks
Tuesday, while Resident Advisers
and members of the Physical Plant
staff distributed keys to students.
I-Iawn reported a iew minor prob-
lems with balky locks, but said
that, overall, the operation had gone
very smoothly.

Hawn and Tederman agreed that
the incident could have a good side-
effect if it emphasized what Hawn
calls "key consciousness,”

Both men have indicated that came
pus residents have, in general, been
quite careless with keys, and both
said Tuesday that they hoped this
incident would make people more
aware of the problems posed by
lax handling oi keys.

New Masters

Tederman noted that Resident Ads
visers will no longer have a single
master key tor the entire campus
they serve. Instead, they will be
issued a set of master keys, with
one key ior each residence hall.

Tederman said he has no iniorr
mation about who was responsible
for the theft of the key, or about
why it was stolen.

A Poem For Those Of You Who Are Gomg Away

You're a iunny bunch oi people
With your yeans and crazy hats
And it's not so much a matter
at your being young and beautiiul

0i six iull weeks without you

I grow a little apprehensive
And a little underjoyed

For you always keep us dancing

Or that your righteous indignation 0n 0“, mm“ mm“, was

Is always iun to have around.

Rather it is that when I think

And without your agile heads to poke us
With the horns oi your dilemmas
We might just tell quite iast asleep

And wake up with the tremors or the poison
That sets in when no one asks a question.

I know everyone deserves vacations
But we’ll miss you one and all
Have a merry, happy holidayI

Tell your iolks hello ior us‘

And when you iinally do come back

We’ll meet you at the bus'

ation are moving the GLCA oiiice

ings between representatives oi the
two groups, and exchanges oi stu—
dents and iaculty among ACM and

GLCA programs,

According to Dr. Bernard S. Adv

genial, and to a considerable ex,

Youth Fare Stalled
by Energy Crisis

WASHINGTON, D.C.~The nation's
iuel crisis is apparently responsir
ble, in part, for the delay in House
Committee hearings on two bills
which would reinstate air discount
fares.

According to Kevin McCormally,
press aide to First District Con-
gressman Ed Mezvinsky (D-Ia,), no
hearings have yet been scheduled
for HR 2693 and HR 3859, which
would permit discount fares under
certain conditions to those 21 and
younger, 55 or older, the handicap-
ped, and ministers oi religion.

The Senate passed similar legis-
lation on November 5, iollowing a
Civil Aeronautics Board ruling last
year that such lanes are discrimin-
atory.

McCormally says Mezvinsky will
support the discount [are legisla—
tion when it reaches the iloor oi the
House.
