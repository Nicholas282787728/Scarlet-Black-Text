OSKALOOSA, IA--The Grinnell
basketball team returned from the
William Penn Tip ff Tournament

. with a third place tinish, losing to
William Penn 64-58 Friday night
and defeating a tough Graceland sq-
uad 83-82 in the consolation game
played Saturday night.

The team was impressive in both
games, erasing deficits of 15 and 12
points, respectively, and displaying
a team spirit that has been absent
in recent seasons. Bench strength
and strong team defense were the
keys to Grinnell’s outstanding play.

Friday nights 64-58 loss saw the
Grinnell squad challenge a tall Penn
team. Ahead 28725 at half, Penn ex~
tended their lead in the second half
to 50-35. But Bill Bailey's clutch
shooting (28 points), strong defen-
sive efforts by Dennis MossandJim
Casey, and the tremendous allrar-
ound play of Paul Delaney and Chip
Hall off the bench, pulled Grinnell
within 4 points of Penn, 58754.
Penn’s height advantage, however,

provided the winning margin in the
final minute.

Then Grinnell showed some agv

Despite the loss, Grinnell proved
to be a much better team than it
has in previous years. Grinnell
had experienced wrestlers in each
weight class and appeared to be in
good physical condition Engram
and Hamby were superb in their
opening college matches. The meet
was not one-sided and the final
outcome was not decided until the
final match, One thing which the
team does need work on is take-
downs and displaying a little more
offensive wrestling. Grinnell wrest-
les Simpson again January 29 at
Indianola.

The team has one more match
before Christmas break, against
Kirkwood on Dec. II in the RE,
Complex.

ing of Hall and Nick Williams. Br—
lice Johnson, Casey, and Delaney
made key steals, helping to shut
out Graceland in the final minute.

and having fun is the idea. Sure sp»

Mulling over turkey and stuffing,

the mind. Friends, soatteredacross

again except for an occasional re-

like that one, are a chance to re-
live days gone. and to wonder about
those to come. Old friends and at
hletes; some are still and some are
not. Some have changed, some have
not.

Some talk with pride of their sc-
hool's athletics while some talk
half jokingly about their school’s
failures. The former class presi»
dent speaks of his Ivy League sch-
ool's failures not in hard terms
but as philosophical matters. The
former football star is playing at
another Ivy League school. It‘s nice
to hear that some schools have found

Saturday, only to be soundly trounr

With Iowa State dominating most
aspects of the meet, and the fine
Luther and Augustana teams on hand,
the understaffed Pioneer squad was
never in contention. The pointtotals

Coach Jean King's Pioneers were

loss of five regular team members
to the throes of academia Also,
this was the first meet for the
Grinnell squad, but midrseason for
Iowa State and Augustana. For Lut—
her it was the season finale.

Despite no winners, several diss
tinctive performances were turned
in by the six women making the
trip. Notably among these were the
fine 400 free style fourth place fi—
nish in a field often of Peggy Ellis
and Jill Hoover's fifth in diving.

2:00 P.M. The opponent tor the

Athletes gripe about workouts and
