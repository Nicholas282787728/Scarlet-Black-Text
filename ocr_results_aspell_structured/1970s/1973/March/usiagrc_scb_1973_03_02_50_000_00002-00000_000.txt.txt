Proposes 4-1-4 Calendar

by John Wylie

Junior Mark Willcher has produced

a proposal outlining seven options
through which Grinnell could imr

plement a 4-1-4 calendar.
in his rationale, Willcher states

that the ideal solution to the de-
clining or stabilizing enrollment
now iacing Crinnell is a program
that “attracts and retains students
of a high caliber without a major
increase in the budget.”

A 4+4 program would, he feels,
closely approximate this ideal solur
tion by offering a wider variety oi
courses and perhaps reducing class
sizes.

He also notes that the program
would allow Students the option of
intensive study in one area and
maximise the possibilities for off
campus research and field trips.

This, he feels, gives both students
and faculty members greater flex-
ibility in their academic lives Un-
der this program, he feels, faculty
members would be able to offer
many courses which are currently
impossible.

Options

Willcher‘s seven options range
irom a basically independentvstudy
oriented program with attention for
cused on off—campus work and a

bare minimum of Students allowed
on campus, to a program in which
all students and faculty would re-
turn to Campus two weeks earlier
from Christmas vacation forspecial
courses.

Intermediate proposals would spe-
ciiy which students and iaculty mee
mbers would be required on cam
pus, based on Course enrollment
or participation in approved ott-
campus programs

Willcher’s proposal is the latest
in a long series oi calendar change
proposals brought iorth during the
past several years. There has never
been any real coordination oi these
proposals except tor a report pro-
duced last Spring by an SGA Com.
mittee on Calendar Reiorm,

Senior Dori Dagenais, who chaired
the Committee and drafted its final
report, complains that despite the
eiiort which went into the work, it
has largely been ignored - although
willcher does mention the report
brieily in a iootnote to his proposal

Still another suggestion, developed
by Dr. Beth Noble, was based on the
Dartmouth Plan, which allows stun
dents to arrange their calendar
from two long and two short “sem-
esters” during each calendar year,
Her proposal was dropped from ace
tive constderation last Spring

SGA Vice President Anne Walter
told the 5&5 that considerable wo»
rk was done last Spring during the
“think tank" meetings on calendar
reform. She added that considerae
tion of reform was eventually drop»
ped, however, on the suggestion
of Dr. Waldo Walker.

Willcher’s 4—1-4 proposal has been
discussed with a number of student
and faculty leaders, and is being
forwarded to the All College EPC
for further consideration.

Bombing Prompts PC Meeting

by Brent Schondelmeyer
E Following the announcement or resumed United States bombing
in Laos, the Peace Collective met in emergency session Friday

night to plan strategy.

Addressing the group, History instructor Richard Kagan remarked
that, “one must see Laos and Vietnam in separate terms,”
In trying to exhibit a “Solidarity oiobjection”tu renewed bombing
in Laos members in attendance reiterated some of the ideas
heard on the campus in successive springs: 1) student boycott, 2)
oliicial college statement, 3) picketing munitions plant, a) eiiigy
burning, 5)‘organization oi the townspeople. No copy of The 0r—
ganizer’s Manual however could provide the means and the ends

desired by those present.

0n the perpetual question oi where to hoist the halyard and what
accouterment should adorn the flag one student questioned the
“intent or profit oi manipulation of symbols.”

A ieeling offrustrationanddisorientationcharacterized the meeting
as the urgency the individual members felt was not shared by the

campus at large.

One or the members suggested that Grinnell help raise money to
re-build the large Civilization hospital in Hanoi hit in 5.52 raids
beiore the cease fire. a guerrila theater that was planned tor the
Grateful Dead concert in Iowa City was not done for a number of

different reasons.

But, Saturday morning the E h c man ran the ilag up the pole
in central campus once again having attached the weathered black

crepe streamer

Freshman Game Tested For Orientation ,

by ken Winokur

Freshman adjustment to college is
an old problem for Grinnell In an
eitort to iind a way to help alle-
viate this probelm, Sam Withers,
resident adviser for Cowles, Dibr
ble and Gates, is experimentingwith
a project called the Freshman Year
Simulation Game.

Thirty students played the game
Thursday, Feb, 15 to test the el-
lectiveness oi the activity. The
game, developed and administered
by Wayne Brian ofDrake University,
requires participating ireshman
students to make decisions as to
how lnuch time and effort they will
put into various aspects oi college
life.

Each student is given a list of
activities and questions relating
to their ideas on academics, social
personal and political lite, and car—
eer choice. To play the game, ea-
ch student must complete as many
activities or questions as possible
in the alloted forty minutes. There
is not enough time to do all of the
items so prioritie’sr'mds't‘be estab
lished.

Activities in the game are quite
varied. Some include: listening to
and taking notes irom a short taped

lecture, asking a stranger to dance
and then having to hum the music,
and having to write the opening to
a speech.

At the end of the forty minutes
students break up into groups or ten
to discuss aspects of the game.
At the beginning of the game, each
participant records his goals in
each of the five catagories. During
the discussion the goals are com-
pared to the achievements.

According to Withers the game
segment is not the most important
aspect of the entire activity, It is
simply the “vehicle" to promote
discussion. The game is intended
to provide participants with a com.
mon experience with which to dis-
cuss freshman problems.

The game played at Grinncll last
week was only a pilot test. The
thirty students who participated

were not all freshmen but Withers
feels that they can provide valuable

Those who purchased items at
the fKDIC auction last Saturday

their payments. Checks maybe
given to any member otthe KDIC
executive board

information concerning the effec-
tiveness oi the program. A iinal
judgement will not be made until
a questionnaire is distributed to all
participants.

Nevertheless, Withers comment-
ed “1 think that the people invol—
ved felt that it was interesting and
they seemed to g involved." The
questions and acti ities were con»
ceived with Drake students in mind,
and Withers feels that they will
have to be changed ii the program
is to be used at Grinnell.

Earlier in the year Withers held
discussion groups with freshmen
to approach common adiustment
problems. Withers feels that these
discussions were unsuccessful and
that the cause was that the par
ticipants had no common experie
ence. Withers hopes that the sl'mr
ulation game will provide the come
mon experience and will theretore
be effective.

Withers and the Deans office are
considering using the simulation
game next ear as part oLnew stus
dent days, Until 'a 'full analysis of
the results has been made‘thefuture
oi the program at Grinnell is on
certain.

SCHAUB (from page 1)

The week betore midesem, Gorv
roll was informed that if the re—
port was to have any value, it had
to be finished by midesem break.
A one»week extension was obtained
by the rather frantic students, and
the report was finished by NOVem~
ber 1 by six students who volunr
teered to remain over break and
work.

Later in December, the Executive
Council looked at the report and
Called in Mr, Vanderpool, Carroll
and Cameron Peterson (another
Concerned Student) to defend their
statement.

One week later the same three pear
ple were also asked to appear before
the Educational Policies Committee
concerning the same statement, John
Lang, the outside expert, was also
present at this meeting,

Mr. Vanderpool appeared once
more in January alone beiore the
Executive Council to explainthe case
once more.

During the months of January and
February, Ms. Hiser asked Pres-
ident Leggett about the Executive
Council’s progress on the matter,
but received no statement about
the direction the Council was like
ly to take.

On Friday, February 16, the EXr
ecutive Council released its for»
mal statement tor the iirst and only
time, which was stulled into iac-
ulty mailboxes. The issue then ap-
peared on the floor of the Febru-
ary 19 faculty meeting that was
so heavily attended by students who
had been encouraged to come by
Communication majors and SGA ole
ficers,

A closer analysis is needed of the
three positions on the Communion»
tions issue. First, the Executive
Council is playing a numbers game
since the Trustees have limited the
number of faculty positions to 103,
This means that new iaculty people
can only be added when other pos»

itions become vacant through lea-
ves of absences, sickness, dismis-
sal or retirement. The Communi—
cations department has two such
positions at the moment, with Hie
ser and Prescott's retirements. He»
nce the Council sees a rather gol-
den opportunity to kill Communi»
cations and win three new salaried
positions which can be reassigned
to other departments, such as Math
and History,

Another bonus to the numbers gar
me would be the reduction of the

total number of departments to 24.

instead of 25, which was described
at the faculty meeting as really
being too many {or a liberal arts
college or this size and reputation.
Both sides of the issue agree that
the present Communications de—
partment is weak and that a change
is necessary Thedisagreement ae
rises as to how the problem should
be solved. The Executive Connoil
thinks the department should be
scraped, while the students think
that revitalizing the department th-
rough currlcultim and faculty is a be-
tter solution. The theory behind a
Communications discipline would
seem to be the more valuable aspect
to look at than the attempt in 1969
to string together the areas ofjour—
nalism, speech and speech correb
tion.

Another argument that the Coune
Cil's rationale seems to hint at
Concerns the high number of dour
ble mayors within the department.
It is suggested that these students
can fall back upon their other ma-
jor, picking up some torm or com»
munication courses offered in other
disciplines. What they fail to see
is the high correlation between Co—
mmunications and other departme
ents, and the obvious lack that these
double majors feel about the com-
munication aspect of the other der
partment, such as political science.
Budget is another area at misun-
derstanding. The Executive Coun»
cil feels that if the Communicar
tions department is kept, it means

expansion. And-expansion means
more money, especially in the area
of mass media such as radio and
TV.

This reasoning is completely ops
posite of the Concerned students’
report which shows that the stu-
dents understand budgetary restric-
tions. They are only asking for
maintaining the present department
funding and iaculty positions, and
are even willing to take a reduction
to a two~man department because
they teel that the new program
they have set up can still be effec»
tively carried out, The glamor coure
ses or radio and TV would be taken
care or under the options of plus
2's for which most of the equip-
ment has already been bought. How—
ever, this aspect of the Communi-
cations department will not he em-
phasized ior the same reason that
it just costs too much.

In the Council’s rationale, they
seem to have forgotten that one of
the options the Council could have
taken was to accept the students’
report tor revitalizing the existing
weak department However, it stated
only three maintaining the status
quo; rethinking, revising, and expane
ding the program; or eliminating
the program. Somehow the real rea-
son for the recommendation thatthe
department he dropped is masked
under the rubric of “priorities”,
The SGA had taken issue on this
point, and questions exactly what
are the priorities of Grinnell Cole
lege, who determined them, and why
they are kept Secret. Also, student
input at the level open to it now is
extremely high in thedecision-makr
ing process, instead of at the be—
ginning when rationales are being
moulded. A iaculty meeting involves
too malty people to work effectively
since holding a discussion becomes
very formal and distant
Thus the root of the problem is
the definition of the priorities the
Executive Coulicil used in develop-
ing their rationale to disestablish
the department of Communications.
