Grinnell Opens London Campus

by Kyle Schaub
A new dimension has been added

to the students’ recurring problem
or locating Grinnell College (or
puzzled minds oI Iriends and rel-
atives, besides denying its exist-
ance in Ithaca, New York and Mt,
Vernon, lowa. As of fall 1974, there
will be an OIIical “Grinnell—in-Lon-
don,H as well as “Grinnell»in»Grin-
nell, Iowa.”

The entire program is being or
gahized by the college, under French
prolessor Victor Vei-rette’s direc»
tion, and will be stalled by Grinnell
professors with assistance Irom
British scholars and artists. Bet»
ween 40 and 50 students will be
accepted, with the majority from
Griunell. Mr. Verrette stated that
an open policy to other schools will
be offered with the intent to create
a mixture ot student types.

Courses in London will be based
on a humanities and social scien-
ces outlook rather thanthe narrower
ﬁne arts perspective oi the ACM
London/Florence semester. The de»
partments the Grinnell-in-London
stait hope to teach are anthropole
ogy, history, literature, art, poli-
tical science, economics, interdis-
ciplinary and international studies,

INDEPENDENTSSJQZ'B

cumulated some background.
independents at the zooelevel, on
the other hand, could bepreliminary
work. They would be similar to cur
rent guided reading projects and
would not necessarily require a
paper or any other tinal product,
According to SGA Vice—president
Anne Walter, who is on the commit»
tee, these 200»level projects might
be more closely supervised by the
faculty director than their 300»level
counterparts.

Plus-2 projects would remain much
as they are and could be either ins
depth research or introductory
guided reading. They would however,
have to be closely tied to a course,
which is not the case with the 4-
credit independents.

The proposals include a recom-
mendation that credit be given to
faculty on their teaching loads for the
independents they undertake to sup—
ervise.

They also prohibit use or nonfat:—
ulty personnel to supervise projects

religion, and natural sciences.

The protessors will attempttotake
as much advantage as they can trom
their London surroundings. Methods
they will use to teach include team»
teaching, guided reading, seminars,
lectures and discussions. To sup»
plement these tactics, professors
will encourage educational trips. at-
tendance at plays, movies and poli»
tical activities and museum visits,

For the semester abroad, students
will take between 12-16 credits, The
semester itself is divided into two
periods; September l—November 10
and November ll»December 20.

During the lirst nine weeks, stud»
ents will take two to three cour-
ses ottered by the iaculty. inde-
pendent projects will not be allow—
ed during the ﬁrst period although
guided reading tor two credits is
permitted.

The second period is much more
flexible, with a choice of {our op»
tions, Students can elect the core
course in London (an interdiscip-
linary study or contemporary Eurv
ope), independent projects in Lon
don, Great Britain as well as in
other European 01‘ African couna
tries, travel tor no credit, and
group independent projects.

and the sponsoring oi independents
outside the director’s department
except where the director has “de-
monstrated clearly an expertise in
that subject ”

otlecampus independent work wo-
uld be regulated as well The pros
posals state that academic credit
“generally will not be granted for
oil-campus independent study,” Ace
commodatiuns can be made, howevr
er, for independentworkdone in con»
junction with oflrcampus study pro»
grams recognized by the college.
Final say on whether projects do or
do not tell within the guidelines ap-
pears to rest with the Dean. Some
student members of the EPC, who
see regulations as being as much
Iur the Dean as the students and
Iaculty, believe there should be an
appeal lrom the Dean's oiiice, pos»
sibly to the Academic Standing Com—
mittee, when independents are
rejected.

The guidelines are an attempt to

incorporate independent study within
the Iaculty’s teaching load and to
bring more planning and advising
into the independent projects, ac-
cording to committee members.
