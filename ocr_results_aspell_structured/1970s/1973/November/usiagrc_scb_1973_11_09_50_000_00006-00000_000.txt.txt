'AGE 6 THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK NOVEMBER 9, 1973

TexlL of Leggefl'Sfaiemenf

President Glenn Leggett yesterday issued the follow—

ing statement
current energy crisis:

to the Campus Community about the

“The current national shortage of fuel supplies is such
that all industries and institutions must take definite
'steps to conserve energy or face far more drastic
measures as these supplies begin running out. Until
the college is informed that fuel will again be avail’

able on a normal\basis,

I must direct all members

of the campus community to do the following:
“(1) Turn out all lights, whether incandescent or

ﬂuorescent,

which are not required for reasons of

safety or other necessary use. Students should nOt
leave residenceshall rooms withOUt turning off the swh
itch, and faculty and staff members should turn off
lights in all classrooms, laboratories, or offices when

these are not in use.

“(2) All thermostats in academic buildings and re-
sidence halls have been set at 68 degrees, and approp-

riate lower than- normal

temperatures have been set

. in other buildings and facilities. To save fuel, do not
interfere with these settings by opening windows or

taking any other measures designed
Wearing sweaters and using additional

. temperature.

to change the

bed clothing at night can be just as comfortable as

raising room tempera ture.

"The college is carefully monitoring the fuel situa-
tion and making assessments and projections based

‘ on all available information.
l will be made in due course."

Mississippi is one of Australia’s
top rock groups and after listening
to their album, “Mississippi,” just
released in the United Slates by
Fantasy Records, their success ls
very understandable. They are an
excellent folk-rock band, at Iheii‘
best one of the very, very best,
highlighted by crisp, lull produc-
tion and a fine sense both (or elec~
tries and acoustics, this three man
combo composed 0! Russ Johnson,
lead guitar and vocals, Graham
Gable, rhythm guitar and vocals,
and John Mower, vocals, has pill
forth here a distinctive, varied col-
lection of eleven songs reminiscent
in some ways of the early works oi
America. The songs are melodic
and original, written individually
by Johnson and Cable, and range
in style from suit, Slow {01k to
electric, almoslshard rock.
Johnson is an excellent guitarist,
and his electric lead has full, 217
most synthesized (one in a very
unique fashloh. His mellow, har-
nlonic riffs seem to get hotter each
time around and blend in extremely
well with both the backing orcheSs
lrailon and Cables rhythm acouss
tic guitar, On one selection, "DO
I,” from the second side of the al—
bum, Graeme Lyall adds tenor and
soprano sax, and 3| times Johnson’s
sound is so rich as [O confuse
the brass with the Strings. He does
his best work on this out and also
“Feel Alone," “Save The L’al’ldH
{ind the superb Cut, “Kings of the
World.”

”Kings of the World,” written
by Goble, was selected as Aus-
tralia’s besi single for 1972 by the

Federation of Australian Commers
cial Broadcasters, and I would have
to think that the song would do ex~
tremely well on the American charts
if released as a single here. The
vocals, by Gable, are probably the
best on the album, which is very
good indeed, and the contrast bet-
ween Goble’s solo leads and Johns
son's harmony vocals on the refrain
of the song are particularly impreSr
Sive.

The lyrics on the album are uni
complex or strikingly imaginative,
but they are coordinated well to the
music and are better than average,
saying things well, though simply,
Goble’s are perhapsthe sirongerly-
“CS, and “Kings of the World” and
“Feel Alone” are perhaps his best
eﬂoi‘is on the record.

Where the lyrics at times are sim-
ple, the music rarely is. Never so
complicated as to get caught up in
itself, the production and mixing,
particularly of the bass and lead
and acoustic guitars is faultless.
1! is the kind of sound that is so
clear it is like‘a transparent union
of sounds, each layered on the
hexi, but placing no weight upon
it The acoustic guitar work is Mr
ten as fine as the electric, and G07
hie, given credit on the album insert
only for rhythm guitar, plays some
fine lead acoustic on ”Save The
Land” and some Diner selections.

While “Mississippi” is not good
enough to receive a rating of Sn-
perb, they are an excellentnewband
and certainly are proficient at what
they intend. If their music is yours
also, you should have a fine album
on your hands, and certainly more
oilhe same in the iulure.
