A Second Edition

The recent publication of the faculty-evaluation handbook under
the editorship of Jack Doppelt and the auspices of the SGA repre-
sents the completion of a long and arduous task begun last spring.
It represents much directed energy of individuals around a con-
crete idea.

In a conference with other ACM student government leaders this
past weekend at Coe College, SGA officials were surprised to
find that as yet they were the only school who had completed
such an undertaking. Other schools had considered student faculty
-eva1uations for some time, but were waiting for the parental
approval of their administrations. Perhaps Grinnell will serve
as an impetus to these schools in similar endeavors.

The “institutionalization of the grapevine" by a faculty hand-
book is a significant step in the student's ability to direct his
own education. Between the faculty evaluations and the course
syllabi, the student, with the direction of his faculty advisor,
can formulate a schedule that better approximates a teaching
style and course load that is compatible with the student.

The faculty-evaluation handbook should be required reading for
all faculty advisors -- the reason not to determine in what per»
centile they stand in relation to their colleagues, but to aid them
in advising their students. An advisor’s knowledge of a professor
and a course in many cases is just as susceptible to distortion
as a student’s. This is not only the first time that a faculty-eval—
uation handbook has been made available to the student body,
but to the majority of the faculty as well.

it is necessary that further faculty-evaluation handbooks be
planned. As yet evaluation of a professor’s performance in his
first semester courses has not been attempted. A close examinv
ation of evaluations of professors show that they may excell in
some of their courses, but are not rated as highly in other cour-
ses,

Certain factors, like accessibility to students, tend to remain
consistent, but others like knowledge of the field and preparation
for the course can differ drastically.

If the faculty-evaluation handbook is to avoid a perpetuation of
judgments about a teacher as a grapevine tends to do, then a reg-
ular publication of the handbook is necessitated. if not, fermen-
tation of any “Institutionalized Grapevine” is in store. Faculty
members whose teaching careers have just started may be inhib-
ited in their growth as teachers, by dated evaluations which make
no allowance for a professor’s improvement from year to year.

New faculty handbooks are also important if students are to have
evaluations on new teachers, and new courses. The handbook at-
tempts to evaluate both of these.

Some concern was expressed by the statistical validity of evalua»
tions based on partial returns of the surveys used for the evalua-
tion. A more complete and accurate evaluation could be gained.
The administration should allow any future facultyrevaluation
handbook to make use of the required class evaluations which
students must complete each semester at registration. This, we
feel, is not an unreasonable request.

0n the part of the SGA, we would applaud them in their initial
effort and encourage them to make immediate plans for a facultyv
evaluation handbook for next fall. We feel that this organization
should create a committee whose primary responsibility would be
the publication of such a handbook.

It is necessary to continue the faculty»evaluations if they are to
maintain their validity. Completion of the handbook only encourages
its continuance.

We feel that SGA has made significant steps in many areas of
student concerns. Though they feel stymied in the fullfillment of
major ideological and political goals, they have continued work
in many of the areas they designated for themselves upon taking
office last spring. Their perplexity at Certain events has been
accompanied by a persistency in yet others "BS"

Gales Demands Refraction

To the Editors:

Since becoming a resident of this
“fair" city some five or sixmonths
ago i have been attacked verbally
and physically by local rednecks,
bigots, and racists. I knew that it
would be rough being the “only
nigger in town” (college niggers
don't Count cause they seldom lea-
ve the campus). So I matte up my
mind that I would stick it out and
not be Scared away. But the shit
has gone too far! I was once force
ihly ejected irom a bar because
my date was a white woman. I was
refused serum in another bar for
being "nothing but a mum nig-
ger." My bike was hit by a motor-
ist who crossed three lanesin order
to do so and then obviously forgot
to stop (I just happened to be riding
the bike at the time). I've been as-
ked to leave town. I’ve even been
ordered to leave Grmnell “before
it's too late,” But I’m not going
to run.

Now it appears that l have not
only the rednecks oi the town to

fight but also the rednecks of the
campus. It seems that John Wylie

and the s 31 a are nOW attacking
me. John, friend, buddy, pal, why?
We were in the Same tutorial. We
even worked SAGA together. When

Crazy House:

To the Editors:

We would like to discredit an ill,
lounded story aboui popcorn and an
off campus house.

Evidently two students havespread
the story that on Halloween night
they unexpectedly ended up tripping.
They attribute their experience to
LSD or a similar drug contained,
they say, in popcorn balls distribr
uted Halloween night by Crazy Hour
se. And further, it seems, they re
ported this story to college offir
cials and elicited the administra-
tion’s expected outrage.

We would like to stress a few pols
his. First, we did not put any LSD
or any other drug in our popcorn.
For verification we suggest you
ask any of the other so or so stu-
dents, including ourselves, who ate
popcorn at Crazy House that night.
Second, the two students did notbot-
her to express their outrage to us.
but instead preferred spreading sto»
ries. We would suggest that these
two students try to remember what
else they ate Halloween night.

Our outrage does not end here
In response to a story told by at
most two students, the son has
printed an article entitled “Pops
corn" in their Nov. 9 issue. This
article states: “At least two Grins
nell students were affected by pop-
corn balls containing a drug belies
ved to be LSD,” The story desig-
nates “a college-owned off campus
house” as the source of the candy
We feel this article implicates our
house ior two reasons- first, we
have been the specified object oi
the above mentioned rumors, and see
condiy, we were the only college-
owned oii campus house distribus
ting popcorn balls on Halloween
night,

We think it might be iruiiiui it

But that isn't the point of this

one.

But John, you've printed lies! I'm
20 not 19. I was not arrested. After
being followed around townl was
stopped at three am. The man who
allegedly made a complaint about
me stealing a bottle of liquor has
denied dmng so. There was no
.22 caliber anything found anywhere
in my car. John, just stop and think
for a minute. A concealed weapons
charge is classified as a felony
and carries a penalty of five years
and the bond is usually set at
$5,000. What makes you think that
I would be released on my own res
cognizance for a second oiiense
when my bond was set at $5,000 for
a first offense? Had I been carry-
ing a concealed weapon and then
been released on my own recogni-
zance, l'd be long gone by now,

no crime) and I will not tolerate

To the Editors:

The administration on this Cam-
pus seems to have finally taken
some half-hearted steps towards
decreasing our use of heating oil.
The temperature in the college oi-
iice buildings has been lowered. But
there seems to be a general lack
oi action in the area of largest
waste, the dorms. To decrease the
use of Oil to heat the dorms, the
temperature is lowered. By decre
easing the amount at heat necess-
ary, the college saves oil. Brill—
iant! My congratulations to the ore
iginator of that idea. But has the
college not realized that there are
other methods equally effective?

Except for the South Campus log-
gia, this college seems to be lin—
aware that storm windowshavebeen
invented. instead, the Vast expanses
of single—layer glass are protected
from the cold by screens. I doubt
if they are very effective. Admitt~
edly, there is a substantial invest
ment required in the initial pure
chase and installation of stormw'
dows, but i see no wisdom inputting
the problem Off. Surely the cost
will not decrease in the next few
years, and most likely, will incr-
ease manyrfold. And in the mean»
time, the college Continues to heat
half of Grinnell. Would not this be
a good use ior the added revenues
derived from the recent $5 million
increase in the college's endows
ment fund? or will another pros
ject, as equally beneiicial in the ens
tire campus communlty be found?

look forward to Scrapping the ice
