for racial justice in the United Star
tes, visited the Grinneu campus in
October, 1967 During his stay Dr.
King received a honorary doctor
rate citation and presentedamoving
sermon at the Convocations’ "Colic
ege Church.” Social change con-
cerned Dr, King most in his speech
of 1967.

He Said, “The job is before A-
merica: to get rid or racial in-
justice, and anyone not working at
it is sleeping through a revolu-
tion," a revolution to overcome
the longstanding problems Oldis»
crimination in society. Dr. King
also challenged legislators to act
by saying, “While the law may not
change the hearts of men, it does
change the habits oi men. And when
the habits are changed, pretty soon
there will be attitudinal changesand
the heart may get changed in the
process."

Dr. King stressed the need for
legislators to use their potential
power to an enthused audience of
students, parents, alumni and tar
wnspeople.

Grinnell Police Chief Bill Pe-

begin a crackdown on bicycles

Peters says Grinnell city or—
dinances require a white head

He adds that the crackdown
is in the interest of salety for

equality was shot and killed. How-
ever, the memory olDr. Martin
Luther Kings' speech of 1957 was
still tresh in the minds or students
at orinneli and thus the Concerned
Black Students initiated the idea
ol a Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund.

The tund was first started by
many benetit attairs and matching
donations by alumni, to date the

Scholarship Fund has grown to ac
pproximately $35,000 and each year

Grinnell Students participating in

Quint Views U.F.W. Progress

by Robert Quint

in recent weeks many people have
approached me asking abouttheboy-
cott oi,lettuce and grapes. There is
some contusion. Some people belive
some contusion Somepeoplebelieve
that the dispute between the Team-
sters and the United Farm Workers
has been resolved. i can only tell
them No, ””3 NOT TRUE.Theboy-
cott or all non-UFW lettuce and
grapes continues; there is no change.
This tact was contirmed the Satur-
day betore last when 1 attended an
lowa UFW convention in Des Moines.

Attending that —_

meeting were a ,
number or United WERSEEWM,

Fm“ Worker prospective
presentativcs "—
from all over the
state including two representatives
from the Chicago area * Gustavo
Gutierrez and Roberto Acuna. Also
attending were two strikers from
California who have recently come
out to work on the boycott.

First on the agenda at this meet—
ing was a discussion or the present
boycott and strike. One of the ori-
ginal strikers speaking in Spanish,
explained the current situation with
the Union. Senor Paloma . 63 years
old - ordinarily a member or the
ranch committee at San Salito, now
works on the boycott out ofChlcago.
He spoke to us not only or his
many experiences in the fields of
California but also of his new ex-
periences and hardships as a boy-
cotter.

Second on the agenda was a gen»
eral discussion of the events that
happened at the First Constitutionr
al Convention 01 the United Farm
Workers Union AFLvCIO. Thatcone
vention began on September 21 of
this year and lasted until late Sep-
tember 23, taking place in Fresno,
California. That convention was an
historic event, it not only marked
the lst national convention for the
UFW but also was one of the first
proletariet conventions in Ameri-
can labor history. The atmosphere
at the convention was reported as
being “tremendously exciting, 317
though there was a definite lack of
experience.” Farmworkers for ex»
ample do not own the expertise
or such things as parliamentary
order One example olthis waswhen
one Chicano suddenly stood upinthe
middle of the Convention floor and

asked the speaker “who the hell
was this Mr. Robert that everyone

was talking about.” Oi course he
was referring to Robert’s Rules Of
Order

However, part of the excitement
of the national convention was that
it presented an open forum for the
expression of all farmworkers. A—
mong the many and various resolr
utions passed at the conven-
tion were: a condemnation of re—
cent events in Chile; iuii support
for the oppressed workers in South
Airica; and, an official protest oi
the dictatorship of the Marcos re-
gime in the Phillipines,

Returning to the Des Moinesmeet-
ing however, a linal and most im-
portant item on our agenda was a
discussion at the recent events that
have been happening with theTeamr
sters Again to reiterate s there
was only a ”tentative accord" rear
ched between George Meany of the
AFLrClO and Frank Fitzsimmons
of the Teamsters. it was an ”acc-
ord” that at tirst “appeared" to
look good because the Teamsters
leaked it to the straight press in
such a way that the news led peer
pie to think the boycott was over
although the agreement was he-
ver signed. Then, two weeks ago
at the national AFL-CIO convention
the Teamsters made their presence
felt by officially reneging on their
part of the tentative agreement.
Fitzsimmons made it clear that
the Teamsters had no intention at
all or leaving the fields. The Team-
sters were up to their dirty tricks
again.

Our discussion lasted until about
1 p.m. in the afternoon after which
we all went out to picket a Dahl's
supermarket r the biggest seller
of non»UFW lettuce and grapes in
Des Moines. The picketting of that
store proved ditiicult. in my opir
nion, repressive judicial torces in
Iowa have successfully stymied any
etteclive picketting by the passage
of an injunction which clearly denies
the people the right to peaceably
assemble and express themselves.
That injunction states that picker
tters cannot speak treely to cus—
tomers who enter me store's park-
ing lotI and that they cannot carry
placards that bear inscriptions urg~
ing persons to boycott Dahls. It is
my opinion that such an injunction
must be busted no matter what
the judge says (the Honorable
Gibson C. Holliday, District Court
Judge oi Polk County). The iirst
amendment of our present US. cone
stitutlon supposedly protects the

Clark Curtails

Travel Program

WASHINGTON, D.C.~Senator Die
ck Clark (DrlA,) has announced
through an aide that he will curtail
his travel plans because of the en-
ergy crisis.

Pete Smith, press secretary to
the Senator, is encouraging news-
people to Conduct interviews by telr
ephone rather than in person to
conserve fuel

Smith says that Clark will be cute
ting back on his trips irom Wasnr
ington to lowa, and that while in
the state, he will not cover as many
areas as he has on past visits.

Clark will rely on what Smith calls
“as efficient a combination" of
commercial air transportation and
private automobiles as possible
when travelling in Iowa.

Finally, Smith notes thatClark re-
lies on automobiles provided by stall
members while in the state, but
adds that, “we will also be trying
to line up volunteers who will swap
us an economy car whenever the
only stall car available is a gas
hog.”

rights or free speech - supposedly

Anyhow, that Saturday a cop came
up to me several times, made some
threats and went away. He told me
not to do this and that, He told me
that contempt of Court was a sens
tence without bail. What could I
say - ijust ignored him.

After three hours of picketting we
all called it quits r a little dis-
appointed and a lot cold. We met
for another short meeting and then
I headed home - Grinnell College,
pure pleasure.

Back at Grinnell again people con-
tinue to ask me about the boycott
and how it’s going. Some even ask
me about what else we at Grinnell
can do to help farmworkers. I have
a tew suggestions: l) boycott Gallo,
Guild, and Franzia winesl If anyone
is unsure of which wines are made
by Gallo, Just check the bottle — I
it is from Modesto, California it
is Gallo A please don’t buy it.
Certain of the popular Gallo brands
are : Hearty Burgundy; Burgundy;
Spanada; Boone’s Farm; RhineGar-
ten; Vin Rose; Port, White Port;
Pink Chablis; Straightsherry; Thun-
derbird; Tyrolia; and, Chablis
Blane. 2) work on some fund raising
project to aid families who are out
on the strike, and 3) come with me
to Des Moines on Saturdays and
help picket tood chain stores.

People, the boycott goes on. Farm-
workers still need your help. Si se
puede.
