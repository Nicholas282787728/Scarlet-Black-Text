by re. Woods ,
The sensation was somewhat akin

to that oi going down ior the third
time in warm molasses. It was too
much. Watergate did enough to dis-
credit our President, but last Sun-
day night had to be one oi the worst
blows our President has suffered
to date. Now I am sure America
is certain: television is out to get
President Nixon. After all, they
could have reiused to give his En»
ergy Crisis speech air time!

I think that America has been hit
terly disillusioned; I know that I
was. Dicke’s image is that of the
sharp, shrewd, heavy-handed,ruth»
less Cossack Chieftain riding out
of the Siberian Steppes to Stick it
to the Democrats. Only the Chief-
tain is on a hobbyhorse. He was
the strict father who, for senti—

mental reasons. still claims his
{16-year-old married daughter as

a dependent on his income taxes.
He was the sadistic lover who,
as he draws back the lash, says
sadly, ”This will hurt me more
than you," and lies badly.

Up until 5:59.59 PM C.D.T. Suns
day, Nov. 25, 1973, Ihad a clearly
crystalized image oi our beloved
leader, that, is Captain Bly in dia-
pers With a copy of the latest Har-
ris poll in one hand, a Ouija board
in the other, watching “Patton”
while twiddling a two-inch hard
on with his toes. In plain English,
i thought he was kind oi a nut
with macho problems and hemorr»

holds. Now that has all changed.
My image oi the President has
undergone drastic change. i no lon»
ger think oi him as mentally un-
balanced. I've marked him oii as
criminally insane. (The main crime
being that we can't cut the power
to the white House.) 1 sat there
absolutely agog, instead or the us»
ual ugly, scowil‘ng, jowly iace,there
was an unusually ugly, grinning, jo-
wly iaee. He looked as if Anita
Bryant had been to Key Biscayne to

and starta nationwide Larry Welk»
type sing-along or for somestrange
animate creature to fly out of the
woodwork and do a commercial
ior Florida orange juice as Amer»
ica’s cheapest source oi energy.

There has been much talk about
reforming the Presidency. Some
say public financing is the way.
others say more contribution dis-
closure laws

 

 

But I say that that point is not
at issue. Over the last thirty years
we have had seven Presidents. six
with pronounced emotional prob-
lems FDR with his grandiose sc-
hemes sent this country into a con~
stitutional crisis by almostdestroy»
ing the Supreme Court. Harry Tru-
man's problems are obvious, Eis»
enhower was sane, Kennedy caused
crises after crises by policy of
brinkmanshlp and thought himseli
the savior of the World, or at least
Viet Nam and Cuba. Johnson had
an ”Alamo Complex” and Couldpull
out of Viet Nam without victory.
Now we have Nixon.

The Presidency is such a huge
and diiiuse iob that now, unlike in
the early part of the century, when
anybody could be President, and al-
most everyone was, the only types
now are people who are power»
and prestige—hungry enoughto brave
the aggravation In my opinion,
in order to be that power»hungry
one must be diseased. Therefore,
I am advancing a proposal, instead
oi continuing in our present merry
way or electing our President, l
suggest we draft. Nader for Presi-
dent'

Professor Karl DeLong will give
an illustrated talk on “The Que»
tico-Superior and Boundry Waters
Wilderness Canoe County” Tues»
day at 730 pm in Room 1’11 of the

0n Improving Grinnell’s Saunas

by Kyle Schaub

KLAGENFURT, AUSTRIA»»Ever
since the Munich Olympics, Euro»
peans have enioyed a heightened de-
sire for physical fitness, Wherenow
the adiective ”healthy” reigns as
the sincerest compliment that a
person can bestow. One can seethis
philosophy in action in the ”Hallen»
bad,” a physical fitness complex
which uses swimming and other
watererelated activities for pro»
moti'ng and maintaining health,
Despite a charge of $2.00, I was
persuaded by a friend to visit the
sauna section ofthe KlagenfurtHall-
enbad, which is owned and operated
by the city. 1 was also partly per-
suaded by my curiousity in thatl
wanted to compare the sauna here
to the one in the complex. Some-
how there had to be a difference.
and l was not disappointed.

First of all, a European sauna
lasts two hours, and is meant to
be a very relaxing, healthful ex»
perienoe. At Grinnell, one uses
the sauna if he can afford the time,
and then usually for a maximum
oi hali an hour. As for philosophy,
one Hallenbad pamphlet compares

the correct sauna to a “body oil
change;” great for the circulation
and the central nervous system. The
brochure also claims that a sauna
promotes a woman’s beauty, a tired
man’s energy and Justly deserves
the title of the “Finnish Fountain
of Youth.” No one at Grinnell ever
said that, but neither has anyone
tried to sell the advantage of a
regular sauna. But the fact remains
that Europeans use a sauna under
a different frame of mind.

The sauna in Klagenfurt is also
more than a woodrpaneled room
electrically heated with a pile of
rocks. There are actually three
separate saunas here one is ex»
pected to use: one similar to Grinv
hell's, a steam room and a zero—
humidity hot air room. Command—
ing the center of the complex are
two identical pools which differ
only in their respectivewatertemp»
eratures - one is a fluid ice cube
and the other an outsized bathtub.
After every sauna period, one is
expected to eagerly enjoy the bene»
fits from both these pools. Thenor»
mal hearty soul keeps making the
rounds until he physically and men-
tally iinishes the two-three hour
cycle. A pause every hour is en-
couraged, and one can even order

other options include a massage

always, have a few more options.
an exercise room, a room open

comiortable enjoyment of this
healthy experience.

Meanwhile, back at Grinnell, the
sauna must attract its visitors purer
ly from its own warm soul. The
accompanying instructions iniorm
the user of limitations instead of
how to take a “proper" sauna. 0n
the other hand, in Europe there
are even instructions describing a

Workshop -- Outlet For Photographs

by Ken wiuokur

Over the years photography has
battled to esmblish itself as some
thing more than simple documens
tatiun or an insignificant game. The
War seems to be winding down
but Grinnel] is one of the last
zones of conﬂict. This year, with
the advent oi the photography Wo»
rkshop, photography may gain the
upper hand in the battle.

book has acted in a limited fashion
as a gallery, but its publication has
not been something to rely upon,
Last year, the Communications De»
Dartment made a small effort to
provide instruction, but everyone
knows what happened to the Depart-
ment. Now a new alternative has
stuck its head in the door

Last year, John Silverman, a stu»
dent with an intense interest in
photography. worked to establish
a much needed focus for Grinnell
photographers. The Photographic
Workshop, 2 product of this work,
started operations just after mid-
Semester break. Darkroom space
has been provided ior twenty stu-
dents and meetings are being held,
to provide a iorum ior photogra-
phic development on campus.
Silverrnan’s original plans for the
workshop were grandiose and am-
bitious. Since formal education is
nonexistent at Grinneli, Silverman
hoped to establish a program of
workshops held hyvisiting lecturers
and personal instruction hyGrlnnell
students. Unfortunately, lack of

the

funds and cooperative interest has
prevented the realization of these
goals.

The workshop, as it now stands,
may all short of these large plans,
but it does periorm several impor»
tant iunctions. previously, no dark-
room space was available ior the
general student body. The workshop
has saved the Steiner darkroom
from being dismantled after the
demise of the Communications De-
partment. Twenty Workshop mem—
bers are now able to use this dark»

room for their extracurricular
work.

Workshop meetings are held weekly
ior photographers to view and cri-
ticize the work of others, to teach
history oi photography, and to dis»
cuss technique. These meetingsare
open to the entire student body.
silverman hopes that these meet»
ings will encourage interest in the
serious study of the field. Accor-
ding tu Silverman, one indication
of the success of the program will
he the quantity and quality oi phot—
ography on campus. “As iongas peo—
ple are getting together and making
pictures, they will have to get bet»
ter."

The iuture plans of the Workshop
are somewhat uncertain. Hopefully,
next semester weekly photographic
exhibits will be established. The
ultimate goal, according to Silver-
man, is that the workshop will li—
quidate itseii by developing enough
interest in photography to hring
forth sensible formal instruction.
This weekend's craft exhibition
and sale will provide the student
body the first chance to view work-
shop member‘s photographs.
