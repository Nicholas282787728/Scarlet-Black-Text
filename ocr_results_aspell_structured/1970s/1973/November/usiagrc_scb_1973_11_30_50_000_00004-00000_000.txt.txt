Evaluating
Evaluations

s the semester draws to a close, the specter of increasing eval»
ions of every sort faces the average student.
recent weeks, students have been asked to evaluate the Health
vice, the Food Service, the Residence Halls,the relative merits
small town vs. urban life, their own sex lives, and a myriad
other institutions, situations, and problems.
erhaps the most memorable was prepared by the Iowa State
partment of Health which asked students to evaluatethe ”Grinnell
” ~~ if they had it, where they thought they contracted it, and
uld they like to have it again. Which reminds us . . . that was
- and a half months ago, and the evaluations still have not been

ut, the proliferation of evaluations poses a serious problem,
ause the more evaluations students are asked to prepare, the
.5 seriously they are likely to treat them.

ean Waldo Walker mentioned recently that some students are
ked to prepare as many as four separate evaluations for each
their courses at the end of each semester.

ne is used in the preparationofthe Faculty Evaluation Handbook,

ile a second is used by the Executive Council. Hopefully, these
n be combined, improving efficiency and, in all probability,
ality of the finished analysis.

epartment EPC‘s often ask students for evaluations of specific

chers. Finally, the faculty members themselves often ask for
.luations of each of their courses from the participants in the

gain, the evaluations serve valuable purposes. However, it

pears to us that all four evaluations could be combined into one

-11 thought out, centralized unit. It would be a tremendous time

ver, both for the average student and forthose who must analyze

e completed forms.

Ither evaluations causeproblems as well. It hasbecome a Grinnell

d to evaluate, survey, and question on every topic imaginable and

-duce “the Grinnell experience” to statistically incomprehensible

reds and iotas of information. We are, we admit guilty of

nning surveys ourselves. We would run more, but we do not

'sh to make the problem any worse than it already is.

Surveys serve a valuable purpose, both for the institution in ev-

1uatihg itself and its components, and for its students as a part

f their education. However, we fear that at times such evaluations

ecome a crutch, with the prevailing sentiment being, “If you don’t

now how to solve a problem, run an evaluation.”

Perhaps a more rational system of evaluating the need and pur-
oses of evaluations will result in fewer needless surveys and

ore useful information for the community.

Speaking of evaluations, there is another type of Grinnell evalua-
ion that is under a constant state of evaluation. Grinnell’s grading

ystem is presently in the process of undergoing its annual altera-
ion, and we feel it is, perhaps, time to call a halt and examine

e results to date.
in the past few years, Grinnell has instituted credit/fail, abolished

redit/fail, established A, B, C, Erase, and is now considering a

ew system which would retain the present grading structure but

ould create a new system for reporting grades to students and
ecording them on students’ permanent transcripts.

The details of the new plan are unimportant at this time, as it
5 still under consideration by a Sub Committee of the Educational
'olicies Sub Committee of the Executive Council.

But, the constant changing of the grading system is important.

he changes in the past few years have been so numerous that the

egistrar has given up on trying to have accurate grade report
‘orms printed.
, Instead, the College’s computer is programmed to cross out the
lutdated information and substitute the current grading system.

-t the rate things have been going, the computer may next have
0 be programmed to cross out what it Just substituted for the
ieleted system.

i We think that, before any change in the grading system is made,

t should be thoroughly enough considered to guarantee that it

ill last for more than a semester or two, Two years ago, Shelley
l loyd (former SGA president) wrote, as she recalled her four year
tint at Grinnell, about a visit to the Registrar’s Office.

“Mr. Seller was busy writing a description of the new grading
ystem, to be attached to the history of grades in Grinnell’s re-
ent past, already several pages long, that accompanies all trans-
ripts.” That was two years ago...by now, the history probably
resembles a science-fiction novel in size (as it always has in

ontent),

Perhaps the best sign of the pervasiveness of evaluations though
can be seen in of all places a graffiti dialogue found in one of the
nathroom stalls in the Forum basement.

One student wrote, “Have you ever thought that writing on these
walls is akin to building sand castles?" To which a second scrib-
bled » “3.3 Idea was good, but you did not elaborate enough."

Women’s Conference Coverage Questioned

To the Editors:

1 would think that the 5&5 editor
would assign a reporter to cover
a feminist conference who either
knew something about conferences
or something about feminism, I am
glad that the reporter's stereotypi-
cal ideal of a feminist was dispel-
led by the women from neighbour-
ing colleges. Bufbeginningwuh such
a perspective as she had hampered
her understanding and resulted in
her vision being very shallow. It
is not only housewives who are
“under the mistaken impression
that the women’s movement requir-
ed that all women burn their bras
and become lesbians." but also
people such as Ms. Redman, This
type of ignorant and insulting cal—
egorization of people is what the
women’s movement is trying to
combat. I find it offensive that the
only article on our conference was
written from such a limited view—
point.

What is Ms. Redman’s idea of
liberation? I Sense that she speaks
of some kind of Ultimate Libera-
tion wherein women pay no atten-
tion to their appearances. Does she
believe that certain outside app-
earances preclude interest and in-
volvement in the women's move-
ment? IS there a finish line that one
crosses and is declared Liberated?
i suggest that the finish line is in
Ms. Redman's mind and is yet an-
other stereotypeuthat of the Lib»
erated Woman. To what norm will
she be required to conform?

We had hoped that many people
(that does include men) who were
interested in women’s issues would
attend the conference; of the women
and men who came, some had had
no experiences with feminism her
fore, others had had a great deal.
The movement is attempting to make
women aware of how they are ex-
ploited in this society and how they
can Start to deal With it,

Two more points. The workshops
were organized so that women from
Grinnell and from other schools
would be sharing their ideas and
experiences. Many women's groups
have no leader, but are made up
of women who take the initiative and
give of the resources they have
This is the format we planned the
workshops around; some of them
went very badly, but others were

extremely fruitful as far as inforr
matinn - sharing, brain - storming,
and discussing personalexperiences
within the topic, and they generated

a great deal of excitement in the
women and men who were involved.

To excite people with ideas and

plans was what we intended to do;

I think we were Successful,

Regarding the notion of “concrete

results,” I should say that the mar
jority of conferences(includlng none
feminist) that I have attended were
geared, as was ours, to discovering
other people's thoughts and pro-
jects relating to speciﬁc topics,
and no specific plan for action was
aimed for. If in the course of the
conference we managed to interest
some people in feminist ideas, I
would consider this “results;" I
might add that one does not see
an immediate change resulting from
consciousness-raising activity, and
things are bound to seem as if
“everything is again as it always
was.”

Finally I am unclear whether Ms.
Redman considered the Grinnell wo-
men’s group as "outsiders who put
on a show" or whether she rnisA

takenly thought the conference was
put together by women who aren’t
connected with Grinnell. After hav-
ing worked long and hard with other
members of the group to organize
this conference, I am angry that a
reporter can not be botheredto make
a simple phone call to check the
facts. As far as I can determine
there was no effort on the part of
M5. Redman or the editor to con-
tact Grinnell feminists so we might
have directed Ms. Redmah to the
workshops that might have better
suited her interests and/or pre-
sented a second viewpoint. lwoulrl
hope the SffB will be more careful
in the future about putting opinion-
ated and personal experiences in
the paper as the only coverage of
an event as important as the femi-
nist conference.

_—__—_—————

To the Editors:

i am in complete agreement with
one aspect of Deborah Redman's
observations on the Women’s Con»
ference: it was “One View,” The
conference was a major event on
campus and as such was, lfeel,
deserving of more than a personal
biased and uninformed commentary.
The S and B was told about the con»
ference well in advance, and was
asked to send a reporter to a plan-
ning session, and to cover the con-
ference. They did none of these,
There were several photographers
present, and now we find they sent
someone to cover the conference
from an editorial perspective, but,
alas, no news story. Isn‘t the cam-
pus deserving of better treatment?
Many people who were unable to
attend sessions would have liked
to know what went on, not just wh-
ether or not one S and B staff
member thought anything worthwhv
ile happened.

i found Redman’s ignorance of her
subject matter insulting. I cannot
believe that the feminists on this
campus could have created her
impression of “butch haircuts and
bulging muscles,” and as for bear,
ds. they are worn only by some of
the men, Her preoccupation with the
physical appearance of the confer—
ence participants also roused my
ire, as this is something the We.
men's Movement is turning away
from. I would rattler have seen the
space given over to some of the
exciting ideas which were discuSr
sed at different times during the
weekend, or some mention of the
good feelings which were shared by
conference participants

Before passing off the conference
as worthless, she might have my.
ed with its “organizers" (for lack

of a better word), as to its pur—
pose: the sharing of ideas, exper-
iences, and problems of and by col,
lege women's groups in the Mid-
West, She might have mentioned
our Saturday sharing session,where
representatives from each school
shared their accomplishments and
problems, or some of the mealtime
discussions when people from dif-
ferent schools got to know each
other. And, had she asked us, we
might have been able to suggest
workshops of greater potential in—
terest to the entire campus than
those She attended which were aimed
more toward those wishing to our
rich their involvement in the move~
ment. As for her final suggestion
that Grinnell people get together
afterward to discuss the confer-
ence: we did and do; every Sunday
evening at 7:00 there is a Women's
Group meeting open to everyone.
Admittedly the conference was not
perfect, and no one is asking that
its faults be overlooked, but we had
expected the s and B to produce
something resembling a news re—
port, and beyond that had hoped
for some indepth coverage. For
contrast i suggest looking at the
two articles on the ACM confer
ence in Cedar Rapids, first a news
story, followed by a personal perr
Speclive of the event. Why is it
that the S and B can give better
coverage to events out of town than
to those on campus? The bright
spot of this S and B issue is found
on the sports page, in Dave Sch,
ecter’s investigation into the smle
of women's Sports. This is a great
start into one of many areas which
could benefit by some investigative
reporting.
