13 Passes Four Amendments

by Mike Breed

Contrary to the expectations of
this observer, the Joint Board did
meet this week with exactly the 19
members required tor a quorum
present at the meeting.

Student Coordinator Craig Kugir
saki opened the meeting with a dis-
cussion of the Cabinet's request to
President Leggett that the black are
epe be returned to the flag asarea»
ction to the resumed bombing in
Laos and Cambodia, Leggetl has
honored the request. Some House
Presidents, particularly Laura Da»
vid of Cowles, thought that the cab»
inet had exceeded its authority, but
no ,vote was taken on the issue.
Vice-President Anne Walter re-
ported that a decision whether or
not to make the Craft workshops
permanent was in the offing; that
lsLITE was losing its funding and
that people should sign the peti-
tion in the library and write their
congressmen; and that an action
was being Considered which would
redefine the role of the Aleramr
pus EPC in relation to the Exe—
cutive Council which would give the
EPC power in decisions such asde—
partmental size and composition
(but not in personnel matters).

The J43 then approved a letter
from the Peace Collective to var
ious politicians condemning the re
sumed bombing by a 7-2-7 vote.
A stronger letter, outlining the gr-
ievances in greater detail, was ov-
erwhelmingly rejected,

Then Came a series of amend-
ments to the constitution. The fir—
st four were proposed by Vice~
President John Pfeffer, and repre—
sented what he considered to be the
most important changes in the re
cently proposed and defeated total
revision of the constitution.

An amendment removing the mem-
bers of the ailvcampus EPC from
the J-B passed by a lseo—z vote.
This was reasonable since most of
the EPC members never attend J-B

 

meetings.

The requirements for the Student
Auditor’s position were changed,
also by a 16—072 vote, Previously
the Auditor had to be a senior,
the new regulation would permit
Juniors and second semester Sope
bomores to hold the position.

A third 16»0-2 vote passed an
amendment to change the mechan—
ism for removing ollicers. Now
hall presidents may be removed
from office by a two-thirds vote
of their dorm, rather than requir»
ing an all-campus election,

The most important amendment
passed changes the nature of the
Judicial Councils. It eliminates the
hall Judicial Councils and estabr
lishes instead north campus and
south campus councils and an 0i-
fice of Community Rights, This
passed by a 16-04. vote.

To become effective, these amende
mentS must also gain the approval
of the student body in an all cam-
pus reierendum. A date has not yet
been set for this vote.

Now for the third and last in—
stallment in our quick excursion
through the committee structure.
This week the most elevated level
will be dealt with, the Committee
A structure.

These committees were estab-
lished three years ago in an att-
empt to involve students directly in
the decisions which affected life on
campus, The three major commitr
tees are: Student Services, Counr
seling, and Social Policies and Regr
ulations.

Student Services deals mainly with
the dining halls and SAGA, the for-
um, and the health service and pol-
icy concerning these areas as they
relate to the welfare of the stun
dents. Mr. Walker, Mr. Kimbo, Mr.
Pdmerenk, a faculty member, and
four students sit on this committee.

The Counseling Committee has
been dealing with choosing S.A.S,

Ms. Schaumburg quoted Ralph Na-
der, who said in a recent article,
"The reason libraries are being
cut so much is because librarians
Squawk less.”

Her reply was, “They’ll be sure
prised when they discover yust how
loud librarians can Squawk when
they’re aroused,” Outside Grinnell,
she knew of organized efforts tor

in Waterloo, but she expected more
reaction elsewhere as people be

ably, if universities made Contri-

In his lecture, he emphasized the
need for the effort towards more
public interest in education coming
from within the campus, andtheim»
possibility of this unless ”there is
the common ground of a shared
purpose on the campuses ”

Dream Together

“In doing this, it is important
to build on the triumphs and ace
complishments of the past,..and in
doing so, you mustn't be afraid
of dreaming, because the kind of
cohesion, the kind of goals, the
kind of sharing ol an experience
must always be based on dreams.

"As you know, Martin Luther Ki-
ng wasn't afraid ol talking about
his dreams. I think it is also im-
portant that, in doing this, the gen,
erations can dream together, and
not apart, and that we let the cola
leges help us regain the shared
ground that we need to regain, not
in different lactions separated by
age groups."

College Study

At the Monday news conlei-ence,
Hechinger said that, although he
was at Grinnell as part oi the
College’s evaluation program, he
was not being asked to make any
formal reports to any segment of
the campus community.

However, Hechinger spent much of
his visit at Grinnell talking to many
different groups, “l've learned a
great deal since l got here”, he
told the 53:8.

Although Hechinger expresseda st»
rong testing that students should
play a greater role in almost all
areas or decision making within
colleges today, he indicated that he
did not feel students had any place
on the Board of Trustees of an Ills
stitution,

questions about a faculty memberon

a conflict of interest. I think the
board of Trustees is a governing
body and ought to be an outside

However, he noted that he thought
student interests could he served
well by appointing a recent graduate
of the school to a one or two year
term on the Board. Hechinger noted
that such a system is now in effect
at several major Eastern universi-
ties and that it appears to no work
ing well,

Budget Cuts

ministration budget cuts in the field
of education, Hechinger expressed
concern that educational institutions
could be hurt seriously. He expialn~
ed that, according to the Adminis-
tration, money that would have been
spent on the categorical grants to ede
ucational institutions will insteadbe
forwarded to the states for distri-
bution under revenue sharing.

Hechinger expressed concern,
however, that the states would ignore
the less powerful groups among
their citizens - the poor, and the
racial minorities — in distributing
the revenue sharing money.

Turning to the proposed Nixon Ade

Vegetarians Seell Alternatives

by Michelle Casey

Eating on board has become easier for vegetarians this semester
as a result of the institution of more and varied vegetarian foods
from the SAGA food service at Quad Dining Hall.

According to the lists posted outside Quad and Cowles for in-
terested vegetarinas to sign up, there are approximately rorty
to forty~five real vegetarians eating on board, and at least as
many non-vegetarians who are interested in eating basic foods,

Bob Konschak, unit food manager at Quad, estimated that between
twenty-five and one hundred servings ol a particular item have
been consumed on any night,

Bob explained the reason for concentrating vegetarian meals at
Quad. 1! is hard to make less than fifty servings ofa particular“
food, so it cuts down on waste and makes it less costly to maine
tain vegetarians foods at one dining hall instead of wasting tood
at both dining halls.

Two of the main problems with serving vegetarian lood are the
difficulty in obtaining supplies and the fact that the cooks are
unused to preparing it. SAGA has run into problems obtaining
different types of grains and other supplies because they must
order in bulk as there is not a great demand for this type of food
in this area.

This problem is exemplilied by the recently obtained yoghurt
that vegetarians will not eat because it contains gelatin. SAGA can
not find a supplier for yoghurt that will not contain gelatin. The
recently used yoghurt comes trom Wisconsin, takes some time
to get delivered, and would be unusable if it did not contain pre-
servatives.

Bob does not see any way around this problem; SAGA can't make
its own yoghurt because of lack of facilities and the necessity
tor a dairy license, which is quite expensive.

SAGA, however, plans to keep the yoghurt, because everyone
else has been eating it. The cooks have been trying as hard as
the management to serve suitable vegetarian dishes, but they are
unused to handling such foods.

Vegetarians have been searching for places to obtain supplies
to help solve that problem, and as the cooks become more ex-
perienced with vegetarian foods, this situation will probably no
longer be a problem, The whole thing is an experimental process
since SAGA has not run many of the main dishes before and must
rely on student feedback for evaluation of the results. From the
verbal comments that he has heard, Bob feels that the vegetarians
seem pleased with the new lood program.

Vegetarians have attended food committee meetings to make their
opinions known. SAGA has obtained some recipes from vegetarians
and is dependent on their feedback to determine future plans for
vegetarian meals, Bob feels that SAGA has tried to geta general
idea of what foods they want in concentrations that are sufficient
for them.

SAGA wants to make it possible for them to balance their own
diets and eggs, cheese, etc. He says they have tried to compliment
loods high in protein with those high in usable protein, and to make
sure there is a balance of food from different protein groups, as
no one group is enough.

Bob teels SAGA’S aim is to try to keep everyone happy while
watching costs. With the way meat prices have been rising, it
could be cheaper to have vegetarian entrees at meals it' a supplier
that was not too expensive Could be found.

Bob feels that present vegetarian food service at Quad Will con-
tinue at least until the end of the year. Then it will be up to the
Student Food Committee to decide future plans based on the stu-
dents' feelings.

A group ol vegetarians has gotten together to term a co-op for
next year. in the proposal they submitted for the co-op, they ex»
plained some ol the reasons whythey lelt it was necessary for them
to live together and prepare their own vegetarian food. saying
“We want to stress how much more there is to being a vegetarian
than )ust not eating meat."

The corup plans to do “serious research in nutrition nndlhe
various ways cl preparing food to gain the most benefit." Lisa
sturz, a member of next year S Cerop, saidthat the co-op will share
the benefits of this knowledge with SAGA
