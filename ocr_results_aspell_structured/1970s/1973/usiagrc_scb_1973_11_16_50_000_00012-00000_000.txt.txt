Complete 0-8 Grid Season

by Tom Sherrell

GALESBURG, ILrvThe Grinnell
football team recorded its first wlnr
less season in 21 years as it lost
the final game 10 Knox, 38-14. A17
though the Pioneers were outscored
by an average of 37,5 points to 4.6
points in each oi their nine games,
the players and coaches felt that
much had been learned and the sea-
son was not a total waste, Everyone
agreed that the Knox game was
the best effort of the season. The
Knox coaching stall concurred, sayr
ing that the Pioneers gave them a
lot more trouble than they expected.

Tom Goetz was the outstanding Cir—
innell runner as he performed well
at both the fullback and halfbackpo—
sitions. Goetz scored both of Grin-
nell’s touchdowns, on dives of 1-
and l/Zryards, and racked up 88
yards on the ground. This brings
his total for the last three games
to 254 yards or nearly 95 yards
per game. On the season, he has
scored 24 of the Pioneer’s 42 pol-
nts. Dave Wopat kicked both con-
version points in the Knox game.

Knox's major scores cameonasl—
yard pass reception by allrconferr
ence end candidate Steve Kubicki
and on runs of 67- and 21-yards
by quarterback Mike Villopek.

The hard-hitting Grinnell defense
forced Knox to fumble the ball five
times. Linebacker Bob Kister re-
covered two of thefumbles.Corner-

back Jim Briles hauled in one in—
terception and narrowly missed two
others. in contrast, the Pioneers
gave up only one rumble and one ins
terception.

Looking back over the longseason,
Coach Edd Bowers commented. ”I
was pleased the season ended on
a successful note. It’s hard to say
1 have a bad feeling about it, even
though we didn’t win a game," Bo~
wers pointed out that the team was
very young and that the players
learned a lot. He cited learn unity
as the factor that kept everything
irom falling apart.

Assistant coach Maurice Hunt ad»
ded, ”I thought the guys played a
good game. Inexperience hurt, rm
not disappointed. We can look for
ward to a hell of a lot more suck
ess.”

Senior defensive tackle and out
going captain Tom Kalhorn viewed
the season philosophically and stm
ted, “Hemingway would be proud
oius."

The Knox game marked the end
of a career for four seniors They
are Kalhoi‘n, John Potts, Bill Warm
Ten, and Don Aldrich. Two other
seniors, Wally Bowers andJim Brim
les, may or may not have another
year of eligibility to play iootball.
Replacing Kalhorri at captain will
be sophomore Goetz. Jim Casey
and Nick Williams will return in
the other two captain positions.

soccer coach Tom Vanderllyden put
in a whole new team, giving his
first team a breather. With barely
enough players for one team, field
hockey coach Sandra Hoth wasiorc-
ed to stick almost entirely with
her starters,

When the 15-minute iirst hair had
been played out, Vanderhyden uni
leashed his starting team again.
Despite several sparkling defenr
sive plays on the parts of Schwartz,
Nancy Breul, and Maren Dougherty,
the women were unable to clear the
ball from their end of the field.
Late in the game a pass from
freshman Mark Schwartz, brother
of the senior iield hockey goalie,
found Calvert open in input of the
net and the soccer team led 3-0

Women Push For Equal Status

by Dave Schechier

While women’s groups are pushr
ing for athletic equality across the
country, here at Grinnell a similar
movement is underway. Ms. San—
dra Hoth, Grinnell women's staff,
has written a proposal that asks
the faculty to “sanction and supr
port a program of intercollegiate
athletics for women.” The proposal
is a good one and merits passage
by the faculty.

The proposal is presented in an
attempt to satisfy “an area oi de-
monstraled Student need." Current-
ly, Hoth says that approximately 50
women compete on teams in tennis,
volleyball, swimming, and field hoc-
key. Only field hockey currently
plays a lull schedule; the other do
not due to scheduling problems. In
the past women’s intercollegiate
sports here have been limited to
informal competition and sportSr
days. However, the era or sports
days is over; the women want and
should have intercollegiate status.
The proposal holds that there is
enough student interest to warrant
this status, In summarizing the ra-
tionale behind the proposal, it
reads, “Women students are cap-
able of athletic competition, they
are anxious to have it and should
not be denied the opportunity to com~
pate.”

Grinnell is a member ofthe WIAC,
the Women's Intercollegiate Athletic

. ,1.

Commission, This is a sub group oi
the national women athletic organl’r
zation, like the men's NCAA. The has
tional parent group discourages any
school irom giving athletic scholar-
ships to women, despite repealing
a rule stating that member schools

could not.

it is hoped that badminton, fenc-
ing, track, soitball, basketball, and
cross country can be added to the
women’s programs. Currently,
there are iour women running on
the men's team.

When asked about women compet»
ing on men‘s teams, even if there
is a women’s team in that sport,
Hoth replied, “That is a question
arising with all of the colleges
currently getting into women'spro-
grams. My personal feeling is if
there is a women’s team, women
should compete on the women's
team.” I agree with that sentiment,
However, iioth realizes that ”at
times women could get better comm
petition with the men.”

The current women’s budget of
$580 comes irom the Special Pro-
grams line or the physical educa-
tion budget. lioth estimated that the
Women will overrun that budget this
year The proposal calls ior a buds

Revise sports Schedules

by Dave Schechier

Schedules for Grinnell's winter
athletic teams may have to be a!»
tered just like the school year, ac,
cording to athletic director John
Pfltsch. While no finals plans had
been made as the paper went to
print, it would appear that the athr
letes will return to school on Jan»
nary 26 As a result of the res
arrangement, some basketball, 5w-
imming, and wrestling Contests will
be attempted However, Pfitscn in-
dicated that Grinnell is currently
the only school in the conierence
that he has talked with (including
Belolt, Coe, Cornell, St Olai, and
Carleton) that is having a similar
fuel problem.

The re-arrangement of schedules
hinges on when the administration
allows the athletes to return, and
reopen: the Physical Education
Complex, which will he closed for
winter break. “They want to make
a minimum adjustment for athle-
tics," said Pfitsch of the admins
lstration,

Basketball coach Edd Bowers may
have six of his games rescheduled.
This is most important since there
is no iinal league tournament for
basketball that decides the league
winner, as there is ior swimming

and wrestling. The women’s events
have been re—scheduled already.
The swimming team faces the pr-
oblem of an unheated pool and the
cancelling oi the Grinnell Relays,
one of the bigger meets on their
schedule. The meet will hopefully
be postponed until one week be-
fore league finals, thus changing
the Midwest Athletic Conference
championship meet back one week.
The wrestling squad will also have
meets rescheduled if possible. The
re-scheduling Will be a topic of
this weekend’s Midwest Athletic
Conference meeting at Coe liiCedar
Rapids.

Housing and feeding of the return-
ing athletes have not been finalized
as of yet. one of the major prob,
lems with the MAC is that the sch-
ools will not get together and form
a single academic calendar for all
of the Conference schools. Pfltsch
indicated that Grinnell has prop-
osed this several times in the past
but that no action would be taken.
However, with the possibility of
other MAC schools facing fuel shr
orlages this winter, this might be
a good tlme to re—think that plan
through. It would make the handr
ling of athletic crises like this
much easier.

Hoth also requests that female sc~
holar athletes be sought after like
male scholar athletes. Admissions
director Nicholas Ryan commented,
"The admissions staff will be plea-
sed to provide interested prospec-
tive Students with information about
Grinnell’s Women's Athletic pro-
gram, as well as to encourage th»
ose scholar-athletes indentifled by
the athletic staff to Consider Grin-
nell. Also Called for is equal pubr
licity for women's Sports, The 31013
sports staff will make every effort
to give equal coverage. Buildingand
Grounds has been called upon to
keep the fields used by the women
in good shape.

The three basic things called form
the proposal area separatewomen’s
athletic budget, faculty approval of
schedules, and academic credit gr-
anted for women comparable tothat
of the men,

Sports lllustrated recently told a
story worth quoting in full. “when
a girl at a Connecticut High School
wished to be a member of her sch—
ool’s boy’s varsity cross country
and indoor track teams since there
were no girls teams in those sports,
she was prohibited by a state reg-
ulatlon irom participating on the
boys' team. In a court ruling onher
case in 1971 Judge John Clarkl-‘ltz—
getald ruled against her, in his post
case statement, he said, "Athletic
competition builds character in our
boys. We do not need that kind of
character in our girls." What kind
of character is that'.7
