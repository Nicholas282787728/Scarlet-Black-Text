Censorship Is A Four letter Word

by Gregg oaitner

American politics is a grotesque
example 01 the anti-intellectual,
antieprincipled country into which
our nation is rapidly degenerating.
As a political monument, and {un—
damentally all important example
of the validity of this claim, I of—
ier iii prootvcensorship,

The spectacle oi support ior cene
sorship, is perhaps the gravest
threat to American freedom pos-
sible. On the one hand we have
the Bill or Rights, and in partic-
ular the first and ninth amendments
therein, On the other hand we have
the F.C.C.

While the liberals are up in arms
over Mr. Nixon’s latest move to
take away the licenses of stations
oi a liberal variety, these same
liberals support such wide and sunr
dry controls as limiting violence
and banning cigarette commer—
cials on T.V.

Meanwhile, we hear claims such
as Newton N. Minow's, that “there
is censorship by ratings.,by adver-
tisers, by networks, by aiiiliates
which reject programming oitered
to their areas. ”

And of course, there are those
who want sex out of the cinema
“Censorship" pertains only to gave
ernmental action No private ins
dividual or group can silence at man
or stop publication..only the gov-
ernment has this power. The right
to ireedom oi speech means the
right to advocate one’s views or co-

mmunicate one‘s ideas and to hear
those consequences such as unpop-
ularity and lack of support. Politi~
cally its function is to protect disr
sentors and unpouular minorities
for ”forcible suppression”.

lronically, any censorship in prin-
ciple sets the precedent of the

“right” ior any and all suppres-
sion oi speech, Thus, it the gov—
ernment can supress the advertis—
merit oi Cigarettes one day because
oi their alleged danger to public
physical health, then they can supr
press Tom Wicker the next by
claming his danger to public men»
tal health. Although the actual tran-
sition may be somewhat slower,
the process has begun The rest
is but a matter oi time.

But this is an issue or principle,
the principle oi an “individual’s
right to free speech”. “A right
is a moral principle deiining and
sanctioning a man’s ireedom oi
action in a Social context.” Yet it
is the nature oi the moral and per
litical principles which define Such
rights that is ignored by those who
seek to abolish censorship.

Like any other right, “the right
of free Speech" has two Sides to
it, On the one hand it protectsine
dividuals from forcible suppression
by others, while on the other hand
it does not guarantee anyone the
support, advantages or rewards oi
popularity which they have not
gained, That is, when the Bill oi
Rights says: “Congress shall make

no law ,,abridglng the lreedoin oi
speech, or oi the press...", it does
not demand that private citizens
provide a T.v series for every
would-be actor and political ttieoe
rist.

But it's an elthel‘ror, all or note
hing issue Either one accepts the
principle of an individual's right
ot ii-eedom oi speech and opposes
all censorship as a Violation of this
right, or one reyects this principle,

In January, 1961, in a case lnvolVr
ing censorship oi motion pictures
(Time Film Corp. V City oi Clli-
cago), the Supreme Courl ruled in
iavor ot the censor, by a majority
of one, The dissenting opinion, by
Chief Justice Warren stated: “The
decision presents a real danger oi
eventual censorship ior every iorm
or commnication, be it newspapers,
Journals, books, magazines, ielevi
ion, radio or public speeches. i
am aware oi no constitutional prinr
ciple which permits us to hold that
the communication or ideas through
one medium may be censored while
other media are immune. It is not
permissible, as I read the Constitu—
tion, ior government to release one
movie and refuse to releaseallother
because of an officials concept oi
the prevailing need or the public
good.”

Such is an ominous warning to us
all.

Duly Visits Alaska’s Shrinking Wilderness

by David Crow

1! your picture of native Alaskans
is one of people living in lgloos,
going about in their kayaks hunt»
ing walrus, you could perhaps pro-
fit from a talk with Marjory Daly,
Dyer. Christmas vacation she V15-
ited er daughte .and her daughv
ter”s husband Anne and Rudy Hoe
ward, both teachers in a small
school in the village of Tanama,
only about one hundred miles from
the magnetic North Pole The peo»
ple o[ this village are not Eskimo;
MS. Daly said that instead they
are Indians, culturally and linguiSr
tically similar to both the Nava~
jo, with whom she grew up, and
the North Vietnamese, whom she
has studied extensively

To reach Tanama, a village oi
about 400 people, Mrs oaly (law
by airline to Seattle and thence
to Fairbanks. From there She boa-
rded a bush plane for the flight
north to the tundra, landing on Ii
small improvised airstrip. “The
sensation,” she said, “was one oi
continuously climbing-~past the for—
ests and over the mountains. Yet
when we landed the elevation was
only zoo feet.”

The unusual atmospheric condi-
tions this far North might seem
strange to someone troiu the “low-
er lorty-eight,“ she noted. There
was no daylight at the time oi
her visit, the sun only rising a
few degrees above the horizon and
disappearing aiter forty minutes.
While it was Visible though, there
seemed to be not one but four suns,
an optical illusion produced by the
prismatic eiiect oi tiny ice cry-
stals Suspended in the air. The moon
was visible 24 hours a day, Dur
ing this particular trip the weather
was unusually warm. When she left
Tanama it was 20 degrees and
when she arrived in Des Molnes
it was -20 degrees. Another time,
though, it was -79 degrees when
she was there, exclusive of the
chill factor.
only about 10% ot the original Al~
askans are Eskimos, most oi whom
live within 50 miles or the water.
The remaining 90% are lndians, sp-
lit among eleven dilierent tribes.
Those of Tanama are members of
the Athabascan tribe. Their ec0n~
omy is Varied: there is hunting
and iishihg, trapping ior skins,
placer mining ior gold during the
summer, and iireiighting. For the
latter occupation, one man is sel»
ected as boss of the crew. He then
recruits men of the village and

they are trained in various fire~
iighting techniques, including par—
achuting into otherWlse inaccessi-
ble areas. The men of one village
work as a team, brought into tires
as a unit.

One source ol sterotypical satis—

, (action areithe dog sleds used ior

transportation. yet here too there
are discrepancies. While the Eskis
mos harness their dogs in a {title
shaped pattern, the Indians run
theirs in single tile, And while
the villagers still say “Mush!" to
start their teams, they say “669‘”
and “Haw‘” to change course to
the right or leit

The dogs are quite iierce and must
be kept chained 0!" controlled by the
whip. on the average, about one
child every two years is lost to the
dogs. The lead dog is the object or
the rest of the team’s hatred, since
he is fed at the expense oi the other
dogs in order to iit him iorhis more
arduous task. IS it true that Ms.
Daly won a dogesled race” “I came
in second," site said modestly.

Ms Daly was especially anxious
to convey a sense of the fragility
of the environment oi the tundra,
and the fact that liie there is mar
ginal She went out on the tundra,
she said, and saw there her iirmly
implanted tootprints oi tour years
ago, She saw the bloated stomachs
oi children suffering from hunger.
And she explained how the proposed
Alaskan oil pipeline would effect
the Indian villagers she had come
to know,

Their iood supply, she said isprinr
cipally the meat of the caribou and
oi the muose. This is supplemented
during the winter with dehydrated
potatoes and rice which are flown
in. The moose is like a horse.
its meat containing little fat. The
caribou is more like a cow, and
is related to the reindeer The fat
it yields supplies the huge number
oi calories consumed in simply
keeping warm. There are still large
numbers oi these animals left in
Alaska' during her visit, she saw
herds estimated at 6000, But, Ms.
Daly said, these animals will not
come near an area disturbed by
man, such as a pipeline. Even a
buried pipeline, carrying the oilat
temperatures high enough to main-
tain its viscosity at a suitable level
would melt the permairost, creating
a permanently disturbed area across
which the herd animals would not
migrate. Ms. Daly said bluntly that
the result of the pipeline would be

the starvation oi the Indians

Ms, Daly was quite concerned that
recent oil and gas shortages in lawn
and elsewhere might have the et—
iect at raising support ior the pipe
line, currently barred by an ills
junction while a suit by various
environmental groups is pending.
She reported that the shortage was
widely assumed to be an intentional
one, created by the oil companies
to get construction oi the pipeline.
That, she is sure, would entailthe
destruction oi a culture and oi peo-
ple ior whom she has conceived
a proiound admiration, sue maln-
tains we would all be the poorer
