COMMUNICATIONS PROGRAM

sMore Support Than Ever

by John Wylie

“I’ll bet you that a year from now
we will have a more broadly based
and iaculty supported communica-
tions program than We’ve ever had
before,"

President Glenn Leggett denies that
April’s trustee action disestablishs
ing the department of communica
tions as a separate administrative

‘ entity was designed to limit the
communications program.

in fact, he noted, the trustees ch-
arged the administration in strong
terms to provide a communications
program at least as strong as the
one cttered under the departmental
system

However, Leggett says that pro
grams in communications can and
should be offered through the other
departments at the collegeuespeo
ially sociology, political science,

. psychology, and english,

Leggett stresses that a thorough
examination of Grinnell’s curricuv
lum is necessary in order to dev
sign an effective communications
program.

‘fl want some practitioners in this
business to come in and to look
at the situation and say...this you
ought to be doing...this is a grad.

uate school function...this is some—
thing [don't think is important."
Leggett noted that currently there
is no one in the Grinnell commun—
ity capable of providing such an
independent assessment,

program came in response to a
Scarlet and Black survey of the
incoming freshmen which revealed
that only a handful were aware that
the department of communications
had been disestablished.

Leggett said that they had not been
notified because the decision of the
Trustees was regarded as a mere
administrative change, rather than
a major change in Course otterings.

Dean of Admissions D, Nicholas
Ryan, however, did notifythosepro»
spective students who had listed
communications as their primary
academic interest ot the change.
Of those written, he said, “one 01‘
two” changed their minds about
coming to Grinnell. ,

Leggett summed up his teelings
about communications as a disci-
pline by noting that he is an Eng-
lish professor, and that it is his
View that communications is one
of the primary skills to be taught
at a liberal arts college.

. Admissions

by John Wylie

President Glenn Leggett and the
board ot trustees Wednesday issued
a major statement on priorities in

Q’admissions policy to the executive
council and the college community.

The statement stressed the need
for ,both quality and‘ diversity of
students at Grinnell, and noted that
Grinnell’s recruiting program sh-
ould take into account special stu-
dent talents in academic areas, jour-
nalism, art, music, athletics, de~
hate, and other areas.

“Because such talents are usually
accompanied by a strong motivation

.towards accomplishment, students
oi this kind represent a pool at
desirable applicants and a valuable
means of sustaining diversity," the
statement continues.

Athletics are a major area of one
deavor encouraged by the statement.
Noting that there is a long history
at Grinnell scholareathletes who
have been successtul in theirchosen
careers, the authors call tor ”ace

ﬁknowledging [that talent in athletic
'competitlon, when coupled with aca»
demic proticiency, is commensurate
with other forms at special talent
and can accordingly enhance diver-
sity at Grinnell 't ‘

Three admissions priorities were
also stressed admission at more
sons and daughters ot Grinnell al-
umni, more Iowa students, and more

"lninority candidates.

. Each oi these groups provide the
college with badly needed diversity,
the statement says. in discussing
giving prelerence to lowans, the
statement notes that, in recent
years, the College has experienc-
ed ditticulty in attracting students

“with small town and rural back-

grounds.

Police say Gates and a companr
ion, Richard Shultz at Brooklyn,
were'stopped by officers ,atter com~
plaints were received about erratic
driving.

Officers ﬁrst found the marijuana,
on the front seat of the car, and
then conducted a thorough Search
of the car With the permission of
the occupants,

According to Chief Bill Peters,
officers found one pistol concealed

in the car, along with another pack~ ,

totaled less than one ounce,

Priorities Set

The statement continues, “Grin—
nell may be international in its out-
reach, but its roots run deep in
Iowa, and the absence ofa reason-
ably strong lowa contingent lessens
an appropriategmix at the student
population to no small degree."
Faculty members are urged to
involve themselves in the admiss—
ions process by “talking to and
corresponding with applicants on a
personal basis.” Faculty attention ot
this kind can be tacilitated by the
Admissions Ottice and can result
in the enrollment oi students who
might otherwise choose institutions
that utilize such taculty contacts
on a regular basis.”
