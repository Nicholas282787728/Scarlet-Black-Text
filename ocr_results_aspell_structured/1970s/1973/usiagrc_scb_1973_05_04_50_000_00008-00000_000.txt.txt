Vazales, Beeman Perform

by Brad Vazales

The tennis team journeyed to Coe
and Cornell last Saturday in hopes
of lettering their 0-2 record. Un-
fortunately, all the Pioneers could
manage was a split, losing to Coe
6—3 but beating Cornell 5-4.

In singles, only Brad Vazales at
number one and Dave Beeman at
‘number two won their matches. Neil
Trabich, Rick Kellar, Pete Doerlng,
and Lee Lasky went down at posi-
tions three-six respectively. In dou-
bles, Vazales and TrabiCh came
through at number one, butthe other
doubles matches were lost by Grin-
nell,

In the afternoon, the Pioneers sc—
ored well at Cornell. Vazales, Beer
man, Trenton, and Doering all won
their singles to put the match at
4-2 in“ favor of Grinnell going into
the doubles.

Doering-Lasky lost at third doube
Ies and Eeeman-Kellar lost at 567

Nevertheless, five games were sqe
ueezed in last week, starting on
Thursday, April 26. The feature
matchrup has to be a battle of the
undefeateds, as Read and Off Came
pus donned their monkey suits and
headed for the diamond (the soc»
cer field). When the dust had ole»
ared, Off Campus had whipped the
South Campus boys 15-11. In the
other Thursday game Haines whip-
ped Gates/Langan 16-10.

On Fridayethe Profs caught Dib-
ble/Cowles with two big runs in th-
eir last at bats. The score was
Profs ll, D/C 10. Also that after-
noon, Smith found the win column
again, triumphing over James/Cle—
veland 14-10. The lone Saturday
game saw Read avenge their loss at
the hands of OC with a win over
Younkers for a score of Read 10,
Younkers 7. For Younkers it was
their first loss; they’d only played
one other game.

Smith and Haines arethe onlyteams
with future games scheduled against
Off Campus. These are the only
teams who can keep DC from going
undefeated in softball, as it did in
basketball.

Baseball: Drop 2 To Rains

by Marty lker
There isn’t much I can tell you
about last Saturday’s doubleheader
at Cornell. The first-game score
was 10-0 We didn‘t have ten. In

the second game, the Iinalwns 15~3,'

We didn’t have fifteen either. So it
goes. some days it lust doesn't pay
to get up out oi bed

In all, there were eight home runs
hit in the two games. None of them
belonged to us. Maybe it was the
“home field advantage"

Not many of the hits were ours
either.

What can i say? Our hitters were-
n’t hitting and our pitchers weren’t
pitching. It’s about that simple, The
defense wasn't too bad though, if
that’s any consolation.

Oh well, wait till next week‘ We

play Coe at home this Saturday,
weather permitting, and plan to re»
turn to the .500 mark in league
competition, which, in other words,
means that we plan to take both
games. That would create a three-
way tie in the Iowa division of the
Midwest Conference and force some
sort of playoff for the division ch~
amplonship. it's a “musbwin.”

“do-or-die” situation, so it should
be exciting,

Since you all can use a bit of a
break and a lot of inspiration about
this time of year, why not come on
out to the North Field tomorrowand
cheer us on against those clowns
trom Coe (weather permitting).

When you see them, you’ll know
\what I mean.

Huff Tough In Shot Put;
Hildebrand: Record Marathon

by Dave Raub ,

Despite some good individual performances, Grinnell suffered from an
overall lack of team depth, resulting in a disappointing tiith place finish
in the seven team Central Invttationztl last week. The performance was
especially disappointing for those who remembered the team Championship
Grinnell had won in this meet last year,

Chip Hail continued his amazing progress in the javelin throw, tossing
the spear 168 teet tor 3rd place and Grinnell's iirst points. Barry l-luii
muscled the shot 50’ 10", just one inch short of the Grinnell school
record, to Win first and add six more points. Unfortunately, this was to
be Grinnell’s only win. Grinnell took fourth in the 440 relay, using three
perfect handoﬂs to heat a couple of faster teams. Dave Wright missed
winning the long Jump by about 2 inches, going 21 it., 8 inches tor third.
Later he duplicated that finish in the triple jump,

Dan Hildebrand ran the mile in 4:29 but finished a close second to Marty
Rathje of Wartburg, whose team won the meet. An hour later he came
back to finish second again in the 3~mile, followed by Dave Raub in third.
Jim Fallace ran a good 51,910rthirdin the 440, then led off the third place

mile relay team for another third.

Grinnell sent its usual contingent of nerveless marathon runners to the
Drake Relays, along with the 440 relay team. Running his best race of the
track season, Dan Hildebrand Smashed the Grinnell record for the marathon

by nine full minutes, covering
minutes.

the 26 miles, 385 yards in 2 hours, 44
He finished 23rd in an event which attracts runners from all

over the country. Russ Damtoft, Jumping Jim Townsend, and Bob Brown

also ran the distance for Grinnell.

Judy Weigel and Roberta August, representing thercweshiek County
international Track Club, ran 13 and 14 miles respectively oi the grueling
event. They were two oi the first three girlsever to enter the Drake
marathon, and both plan to run the entire distance beiore their college

careers are over.

Golfers Bogey At Drake

hy Arturo Tapia Jr.

Last week the Grinnell Sandbag<
gets suffered a disappointing defeat
at the Drake Relays. On the two
day tournament the Pioneers finiSr
hed well back in the strong field
of competitors.

The first day proved to be a big
surprise as the Pioneers shot some
excellent golf on the long and dif»
ficult North course of the Des Mo-
ines Country Club. The sandbaggers
were paced by Long Hitter Tred—
way who shot an 80, which could
have been much better had it not
been for a horrendous double bogey
on the last hole. Deadly Touch El—
lensnn played well and came in at
El while Controlled Hook Friend

finished with an 83 after a Slow stv '

in with one of the highest scores of
the tournament. Overall, the Pio-

versities which participated.

The second day, however, was a
drastic reversal of the first day.
Plagued by strong winds and con-
crete greens, the sandbaggers shot
disappointing scores. The only
golfer who played decently was Con-
trolled Hook who came in at 82.
Apart from him, the rest of the Pi-
oneers would like to forget the sc—
ores they ended up with.

Deadly Touch Ellenson had an 85
while Classic Push ended with an
87. Long Hitter and One Putt also
were never able to put it together,
and finished with high scores. The
Pioneers had a second day total of
343 which left them way behind in
the field.

Coach Bowers was quite dejected
after the tournament. After early
signs of improvement, the sand
baggers fell apart completely, and
disappointed everybody. The only
explanation the coach would give
was the sandbagger’s poor short
game. He only hopes that the Pio-
neers pull themselves back together
again for this week’s dual match
against Knox.
