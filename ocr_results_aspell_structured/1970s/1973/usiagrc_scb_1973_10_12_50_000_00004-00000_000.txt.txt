File Under 'F’ .

One of the most bemuddling inheritences of an editor is the per-
sonal filing system of his predecessor. Stamps are not found under
“Stamps," ~but filed under “Postal information.” Thus when an
SGA official came to us looking for proposals in previous years
on governance, we found the information under “Faculty Reorgan-

, ization.”

Stuck between numerous mimeographed sheets was an article
written by President Leggett for The Centennial Review in 1970
titled “The Small Private College: An Equilibrium Between
Change and Constant Values.” The timeliness of his comments
caused one to wonder if the article had been prepared for the
Presidential remarks that set the stage of neutrality, before dis-
sension reigns in faculty deliberations over major issues. _

One remark was of particular note. Leggett observed, “We
cannot go back to the time when the limits of student decision-
making were clearly understood and accepted by all parts of the
campus community. In a small college especially, we have to
find the new limits and the limits have to be rationally intelligible
for students and faculty, and then for alumni and parents.”

The question of who governs is the basis of political science. As
asked of this institution, it has provided a continuity to this place
that preceeds even the Grinnell experience. Recent years have
found the quantification of the statement to include _, “Who governs
and to what extent?”

In our residence halls the school has rightly abdicated a felt
responsibility to act in loco parentis and have left governance of
these areas to the students. This was not possible until new limits
rationally intelligible to all concerned were agreed upon.

Much distortion now clouds the discussions surrounding the existing
and proper roles of constituents in regards toacademic governance.
The Executive Council has stated their position explicitly,

/

“Though the role of the students in academic policy making is
necessarily subordinate, students are key sources for understand,
ing and evaluating both our educational process and proposals for
its improvement. Effective machinery for a contribution from stun
dents toward formulation of academic policy is essential if that
contribution is to be of value. So~also is the effective co-operation
of students in organizing and participating in such machinery.”

It is our belief that the Executive Council statement has answered
bluntly for the students who necessarily should govern prima facie
and more importantly to establish limits on what extent.

The machinery of the Executive Council was created in the fall
of 1970 on a trialbasis. Sufficient time has expired at this point
to judge the\capabilities and limitations of the existing machinery
from the consumers standpoint.

Many faculty members have argued the point that all that is nece
essitated is to “hone" the current mechanism. One can hone a
kitchen knife, but it still may notbe the right instrument and possess
the capabilities with which to dissect problems which face the school,

The situation requires a board of examiners who understand the
machinery currently in our possession. Its entire function, rather
than individual irksome parts, needs to be looked at closely from
outside the current framework. It may determine that the mechane
ism is dated and should be willing to look for new ideas among those
institutions which Grinnell attempts to emenate, But the task needs
to be undertaken immediately,

One panel of the Liberal Arts Conference suggested that Grinnell
could be what it wanted to be. The problem is we have yet to more
oughly decide this except on an ad hoc basis. We have yet to strike
that equilibrium between change and constant values in the area of

academic governance.

Form follows function and we must determine what that function
should be. The opportunity presents itself at this point to begin

such a task.

We know the existing limits of students in academic governance,
but are unsure of the limits to our patience. Postponement of the
issue is not unlikely, and Scott Weil may not be around to be
kicked, but the issue will persist.

We urge a Commission on Governance.

Oswald: Chile Hysteria llot Needed

To the Editors:

It seems that someone went wild
With a piece of chalk this week; I
refer to the Chile "Statements"
plastered all over campus Tuesday
morning. i think someone’s enthur
slasm is becoming overbearing. i
do not know to what constructive
goal all this advertisement is di-
rected, but I do believe that it is
getting out of hand.

The main cry of the Chilean supp-
orters on campus is that Chile’s
“death" is to be blamed on “Amer-
ican interest," a good point,Isuppr
use, but look at it again: if “Amer,
icah interests” are to blame for
the bloodbath in Chile. What makes
you think any Chilean wants any
more Americans (however “good”)
butting their wellvmeaning noses
back into Chileangovernmentalbus-
mess?

I also wish to point out that, no
matter how unjustly and cruelly the
present government got there, they
are running things, They have cl-
amped Chile tightly shut to any
outside influences, SO, even if we
wanted to (Week of Solidarity) or
should give our help, how can we?

Rep. Admissions Stall?

To the Editors:

This letter should not, in any way,
be misconstrued to be an indict-
merit against any individual mem»
ber of the admissions staff, but ra»
ther it is an attempt to make some
observations in light/ of the cone
cerns expressed in this area,

Firstly, it seems to me that an
admissions / recruitment
staff should reflect thegeneraltenor
of the campus. It should be reprer
Sentative of the student body in
terms of sex, race, and, tondegree,
physical appearances, What strikes
one immediately upon viewing our
present staff as a whole is its
sameness: .e., male, Grinnell Col-
lege graduate, Elf-jock, Short hair.

When I wander around campus, I
see very few students who are cast
in this mold, Can a preefreshman,
never having been on the Grinnell
campus, get a true picture of our
students from these representa~
lives? Can they adequately describe
what the “Grinnell Experience" rer
ally is7 or how women are viewed
(tr View themselves?

They might very adequately pore
tray an image the administration
and/or alumni would like to see
in its representatives. but is this
the image that will attract pree
freshman (The important goal, I
hope.)

Mayber the admissions staff can
answer “yes" to all of the above
quusiionsmif so, fine, but i tend
to doubt it. It is time to take a
look at not only» our recruiting
policies bui our recruiters is well,

Name withheld upon request,

No one is getting in OR out of the
country, Instead ofbeating ourbrea-
sts in grief for the thousands of
dead and lamenting American guilt,
stop the hysterics, do a little se»
rious thinking, and inform the cam»
pus community of a goal for which
concerned parties can strive.
Meanwhile, stop obtruding your
hysteria on me. I resent beingblud-
geoned by the issue at every step
on the loggia (especially at 8 or 9
in the morning) and I resent hav-
ing my campus environmentdefaced
to display your grief, And as for
the “decorations" on the classroom
blackboards and Staircases
of ARH...!

Kurz 0n Recruiters

To the Editors:

lam writing this letterin response
to the one appearing last week
with the headline - “Friedman Bl—
asls Kurz, Supports MarineRights,”
Indeed, I feel Somewhat prompted
to reply, but i would like to make
it explicit that i am not “blasting"
anyone. As a matter of fact I enr
courage anyone to come over and
discuss divergent (or for that mat-
ter convergent) points of view.

I do not want to rediscuss the
entire recruiter issue. First, i would
like to pose two questions: What
about the "freedom” and “rights"
of the peoples of Vietnam, Cam»
bodia, and Laos to choose their
own type of government? And, what
about their “freedom”and"rights”
to live a life of peace, as Opposed
[0 the violent influence (spiritually
as well as physically) of U.S. mili-
tary and industry?

Secondly, l propose the following
to be adopted as Grinnell College
policy, hopefully acceptable by all:
All institutions, organizations, and
individuals shall beallowedtoopene
ly express their views on this came
pus, through the distribution of lit-
erature, public meetings, lectures,
or discussions open to all, or th-
rough other means of honest and open
communication. There shall be no
formal recruitment allowed of any
individual by any institution, organ-
ization, or corporation except by
those concerned with the future ac—
ademic education of an individual.
This regulation shall not deal with
student and other college related
organizations. Informal arrange-
ments communicated directly bet—
ween students and the recruiter,
where the college is in no way iiir
volved, will be allowed.

I hope that this proposal can be
voted upon by the entire campus
community - students, faculty, and
administration.

Miller 0n Student Rights

To the editors:
. As a member of the South Cam—
pus Judicial Council and Having had
some experience with KDIC, I read
with interest your article concern-
ing theroccrd thefts, particularly
the part dealing with the now offi—
cial procedure for confiscationofthe
stolen records. I feel that this pro—
cedure is a violation of a student’s
rights and i will have nothing to
do with it.

To quote from the official dice
tum:

...entry shall be permitted in any
person who secures written authe
orization from at least two meme
bers of the North or South Campus
Judicial Council. These members
must be on the Judicial Council
which has jurisdiction on the cam-
pus where the student room to be
entered is located. The authorized
person must be accompanied by an
officer of the hall or by any meme
ber of the residence hall’s staff,
and these have no option but to
accompany the authorized person.
At first reading, this appears to
be nothing more than the allowance
of some type of Search warrant
But when one digs into it, the lack
of regard for student rights is
appalling. This policy says nothing
about the student being present when
the “authorized persons” camarﬁ
in other words, breaking and enter-
ing is all right And even if the
person is present, is he/she aIIDWr
ed to see the “Written authorizrh
ticn”? As I read it, not if the
avenging angels don’t want him/her
to. In fact, there IS nothing that
States that the officers of the hall
who are supposed to accompany
the “authorized persons” have to
see the written authorization. When
these facts are taken into consi-
deration, the policy looks more
than a little bit like the federal
“NOrKnock” law (John Mitchell's
brainchild). One begins to get Vlr
sions of G. Gordon Scherler and
his crack squad of record, agents
blasting down some student‘s door
with Thompson sub-machine guns
and leargas grenades to get at
“The Best of the Archies ”

I do not condone the stealing of
records from KDIC. Iundersland
the problem first hand--more than
a few times albums that I have

wanted to use for my show have
been missing from the KDIC ar-
chives. However, the present solu-
tion is as bad as the problem itv
self. if not worse.

The concept of a Judicial Council
is that it willprovidejusticetothose
who have been wronged. There is
no justice involved in ordering
break-ins (despite John Ehrliche
man’s opinion). My duty as a mem-
ber of the South Campus Judicial
Council is clearrrl shall issue no
“written authorizations" to anyone
allowing them to enter a student’s
room without that student's know-
ledge and permission,

Jeffrey S, Miller
Mears Hall

Ed. note--At our request, the Office
of the Deans of StudentAftairspro»
Vided the following answer to Mr.
Miller's letter.

”The policy referred to in Mr.
Miller's letter may be found on pa-
ges 33‘39 of the current Student
Handbook Promulgaled a number
of years ago by the Student Affairs
Committee (the predecessor of the
Social Policies and Regulations (SP
an) Committee), it is certainlyopen
to interpretation. Firsl, any person
or organization desirous of gaining
access to a student room mustshow
substantial cause for doing so. Se»
condly, it is not the intent of the
policy in he a “no knock" one or to
leave the accused in the dark as to
the charges ’

Granted, this is a very ill-de-
fined policy, but at the present time,
it is the only policy in this area.
Contrary to campus myth, thepnlice
do have the right to enter campus
rooms without giving 24 hournolice,
providing they have a search wirre
ant. This policy was intended in
he a method whereby the college
community could deal with its own
problems and, as such, it is the ob—
ligation of individual judicial coun—
cil members, when approached, to
review the evidence brought before
them (much as a judge would do)
