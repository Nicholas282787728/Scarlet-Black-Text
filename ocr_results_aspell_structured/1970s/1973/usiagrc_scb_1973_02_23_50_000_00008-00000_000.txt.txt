Hoopsters Visit Coe,
Beloit - lose Twice

by Dave Calvert

Grinhell's varsity basketball team,
its home season over, went on the
road last week and dropped Friday
and Saturday night games to Coe
and Belolt. The double loss ended
the Club's winning streak at one
and brought Grinnell’s record to
2-9 in the Midwest Conference and
2-16 overall,

Playing for the first time this
season against the strong Beloit
team that has lost only to Coe
twice (they beat us 9754) and St.
Olaf (they beat us 83-38), the Pi-
oneers looked tough in tile first
half. Down by only five points at
the midway break, Grinnell seem-
ed to have a. chance Despite con-
sistent shooting by the Pioneers,
however, Beloit rah their lead up
in the second half and gained a
70-55 victory. For the Pioneers,
the big story was Freshman John
Haigh, l-laigh hit 9 of 13 Shots (the
team as a whole connected on no
less than 26 of 57) and finished
with his season and career high

Bowlers Win

by Keva Stubbs

The Crinnell Bowling team sucs
cessfully ended its first match by
defeating the Grinnell High School
team on February 7th by a score
of 3 to 1.

Ken Ellensou of the Pioneers led
the team to victory with a 599 ser-
ies and games of 223, 139, and 232.
Barry Huff assisted the team with
his manpower to finish second witha
526 series, Richard Rosson and Da-
vid Weston completed the team.

Rod Allen was high man for the
High School team with a 484 series,

of 20 points. No other Pioneers
hit double figures, Paul Siemers
did a good job as he came off
the bench to score 7 points and
rebound well,

Winless in its nine prevtous road
games, Grinnell was not expected
to give Coe any trouble Saturday
nightssand didn't. The undefeated
kohawks, with 19 wins this season
and n 24»game winning streak eXr
extending iroin inst season, rushed
to a commanding 49-sz halftime
bulge. Led by center Bill Carrit-
liers’ 21 points, Coe posted a 97~
54 triumph and thereby clinched at
least a tie for the Midwest Cons
ference championship Haigh nnd
Senior Chuck Patterson led Grinr
nell scorers with 15 apiece,

This weekend the Scarlet and Bias
ck travel to Northfield, Minnesota
for a Friday night duel with St,
Olaf and a Saturday afternoon clash
with Carleton As any Grinnell stur
dent worthy of the name knows,
the Carts are one of the two clubs
that have fallen before the Pioneer
assault, With that win Grinnell’s
allrtime record against Carleton is
3044, Allrtime against St. Olaf
Grinnell is l4r26,

Swimmers 'l'tilte Knox, luther

by T, R. Key

Buddha showed that lie is alive,

and well this weekend. The Fans
cake squad turned into angellood
cake on Thursday and defeated Knox
62750. The turkey squ’ad seemed
to he fired up but didn't get roll—
ing until the so free A one~two
finish by Mike Beye and Ron Bras
miner led the way to even greater
things,

During the 1M ,Turkey Bob win-
ters showed how it was done setting
pool and school records in a time
of 210 5 After a routine one-two
finish in the diving, a second see
are for Knox's Varik in the 100
free came turkey Bob. Head to
head again with [(nox’ Zimmerman,
Bobby again set school and pool
records, this time in the 200 back—
stroke (2-10 6). The 500 took the
chuckles out of the Knox coach as
the meet was iced with two events
to go.

Luther

Moving on the turkey squad did
proceed to gobble up the field at
the Luther invitational. Turkey Bob
once again led the way by winning
three events and being named most
valuable swimmer of the meet. T.
Boh set a meet record in the 1M.
of 2,12 2 and then rested. Later he
also won the 100 free and the 200
back

Luther was truly a team effort
as Grinnell massed 272 points. Fir
nishers in the top six were: Bob
Brown, 5th in the 500 and 1000
free; Al Btesh, 4th in the so free,
Mike Beye, 5th in the 50 free and
4th in the zoo breast; Tom Rowat,
4th in the 200 free and 3rd in the 200
fly; J Fleck, 2nd ill the 200 back
and 4th in the 200 I.M.; Dale Stir
herler, 5th in the 200 fly. Our med-
ley relay of Bi-ammer, Beye,Scherr
ler and Reed finished in first place
and the iree relay of Btesh, Bram»
mer, Reed and Kuwait placed third.
on. by the way, because of the lack
of significant competition, diver
Larry Huntoon set a relays record
of 329.70 points. Huntoon was fol-
lowed in second place by Mr. Pres
paration “H" Mark Burton.

Buddha's Future

The final dual meet of the season
is with conference contender Corr
hell on Friday. A liberated Buddha
will decide on a home at that meet.
On Saturday, several of the over
the-hill gang alums will battle the
Turkey squad. Just watching thede-
crepit old men hull and puff should
be good for a few laughs,

Next Friday and Saturday the Tur-
key squad flies to Ripon to bring
home the gold from the conference
meet, Gohble!

Hockey Defeat;
Team Confident

by Jeff Dick

Last Sunday Grinnell’s hockey team
traveled to Omaha to play Creigh-
ton and lost by the narrow margin
of 3 - l, The two teams were pretty
evenly matched, both young and fair-
ly inexperienced. Creighton prob.
ably held a slight advantage because
they had already played ten games
while Grihneli had only played bnce
previously, ’
Creighton opened up the scoring
in the first period when a shot re-
ﬂected off one of the Grinnell de-
fensemen and into the corner of the
net, Creighton's second goal didn’t
come until midway through the se-
cond period when a defensive lapse
allowed a Creighton skater to get a
breakaway shot on goal, Grinnell's
goalie Mike Levy partially blocked
the shot but it slid behind him into
the net. Then in the third period
Grinnell got their goal. Al Frey
and Jeff Dick (Grinnell‘s only Verr
mantel-s) teamed up to score the
goal that made it 2 r l. On a “min-
attire" rush Jeff passed to Al for
the shot and then tipped in the rev
hound. Creighton added an insurance
goat near the end of the game as
a shot bounced off of Levy's shoul—
der and into the net,

The entire Grinnell team played
much better in this game than in
the Drake game. The defense played
a little better, especially goalie Mike
Levy. He took 37 shots on goal,
only allowing 3 to get by him, and
he also covered up for many of
the temporary defensive lapses. The
passing and shooting were also im—
proved as Grinnell took about 113
shots on the Creighton goal. As the
team continues to improve its ap-
proximately 20 members aregetting
psyched up for a victory,

Those who made the trip to Omaha
and played well were Don Aldrich.
Larry Breskin, Jeff Dick. Dave Fla-
ten, Al Frey, Steve Larrick, Lee
Lasky, Mike Levy, .lay MacAiee,
Barclay Shultz, Bob Smith, Steve
Snider, Dave TenEyck, and Keith
Tyler. Mary Levy accompanied the
team and kept statistics. Afewplay-
ers couldn’t make the trip, some
due to injuries, including Jon Silln
(he wanted some ink).

Everyone skated hard and the play
was fast, hectic, and rough attimes.
Everyone was exhausted at the end
of the game but wanted to play more.
Therefore, the team scheduled two
more games in Omaha. This Sunday
night they will play the University
of Nebraska at Omaha, and a re-
match with Creighton was also sch~
eduled for the near future,

Women Swimmers Drop Tw

by A. Drowned Rat

The Grinnell fishes got off to a
great start by drowning the Grace-
land girls in a swim meet last sem-
ester, However, ihiS semester the
University of Nebraska and Iowa
State proved to have faster fins,
despite the arduous workouts con-
ceived by Coach kingfish.

On February 3 the “school" true
veled to Ames where they were
promptly beaten by the whales from
Nebraska and Iowa State. Tile highs
light of the day was Margaret Mine

now’s graceful gliding through the
water in the 50-yard freerstyle,
which gave Grinnell six of its 22
points. The second highlight of the
day was Betty Barracuda’s near
second in the 50—yard backstroke.
Other fishes who contributed their
efforts are Gail Goldfish, Ann Ans
geifish, Janet Guitar—fish, Jill Gups
py, Amelia Angel—shark, and Bon—
nie Bluefish. l‘he team Suffered by
the absence of two of its fine flip-
pered friends, Sweat Stingray and
Amy Anchovle. ,
