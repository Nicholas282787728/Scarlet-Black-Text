Cleared there were three undefeated
teams: Off Campus, Profs, and
James/Mears. Close behind, at 2-1,
were Haines and Loose. That there
have been no forfeits and that the
retereeing has been an all-time
Grinnell peak in quality is due lar7
gely to the efforts of Tim Gold-
buff and Dave Gitlin.

Cleveland/Main quickly estah7
lished its position in the cellar
on Monday, January 22, by succumb-
ing to E. Norris 57-34, as Bob
Arnold tallied 23 points for the

Off Campus, recently bolstered by
the addition or iormer varsity play7
ers Bill Bailey and Rick Williams,
handily defeated w. Norris l by a
score of 77743 Bailey scored 32
points. Also that night Loose heat
back Cowles 43737, and Haines cnn7
quered Smith 49727.

Tuesday night iound Dibble pitted
against Read, and the Dibble Bufti’s
polished on the South Campus boys
61-48, as Freshman Tom Goetz
poured in 20 points, Despite Chip
Hall’s 20 point effort, the Profs got
by a tailGates/Langan Squad, 40-37.
Greg Fallon’s 23 led James/Mears
to victory over Younkers, as Rick

close loss to conference Champion
Ripon (58-55) proved to darken the
two victories.

These results of the triple dual
conterence meet evened the squad’s
record at 272.

Double winner Bob Winters stim7
ulated our fowl friends with his
wins in the 200 backstroke and the
200 individual medley. The highest
ilying turkey or the day was ob7
viousiy diver Larry Huntoon, who
won both diving events,

Other of our feather friends also
performed well. John Fleckenstein
earns the turkey oi the week award
[or his fine Swims in the 200 in7
individual medley and the 200 back.
J, Fleck (r‘leckenstein) is doing an
excellent 30b of replacing absent
Mark Williams.

Mike Beye swam after years of
studied practice and is showing great
improvement in his breast-stroke
times. He must be working out more
than we know about. The Panamanian
wonder, Al Btesh, is also swimming
like an otter

to be the toughest competition the

Hoopsters Eall Twice

by Bruce Johnson

The Grinnell basketball team lost
to two Midwest Conference title con-
tenders thls past wekend in Darby
GymnaSlum. Both Knox and Moh—
mouth took advantage ofGrirlnell’s
{rigid shotting percentage to post
their victories. Knox outscored
Grinnell 60755 Friday night, while
Monmouth won 83766 Saturday even-
lng.

The fact that Grlnnell took more
shots from the field than Knox har-
dly seemed to make any difference
in the Friday game, The big factor
was shooting percentage7—Grinnell
shot 28% while the Knox team put

Chuck Patterson 8, Jim Casey 4,
Jeff Dick 5 and Bruce Johnson 6.
Monmouth easily handed Grinnell

for the Pioneers. Leading scorers
from Grinnell were Rick Sturgeon
with 10 points and Bruce Johnson With
