Faculty Alters EPC, Practica

by Don Dagenais

Approving a proposal irom the
all»college Educational Policies
Committee, members of the faculty
voted Monday to limit to 8 the num—
ber of practicum credits which may
be counted by students towards the
124 credits needed for graduation.

The former limit, established the
ree years ago, was 16.

The faculty also approved, with
some revisions, a motion by the
Faculty Organization Committeeab-
olishing divisinal Educational P07
licy Committees and substituting
a mechanism whereby course chane
ges will be approved by the iaculty
members of the division rather
than by a studentvfaculty EPC.

Second Class

Action on practicum credit was
taken largely because members oi
the Academic Standing Committee
have recently observed that stu-
dents petitioning for academic over»
loads frequently refer to practicum
credit activities as “somethingtltey
would do anyway", indicating, in
the words of Dean Waldo Walker,
that they considered practica “se-
condeclass credit."

Credit ior participation in activir
ties such as theatre productions and
musical organizatins was initiated

alter the Haveman Report in 1967.
At that time it was called "car
curricular credit" and carried a
b-cretlit limitation. The limitation
was upped to 16 credits in 1970.

Associate Professor oi History
Don Smith offered a brief history
ot the proposal, suggesting that
the original purpose of practicum
credit was that it was useful ”as
a means of introducing students to
parts of the curriculum that they
might not otherwise become
acquainted with.”

When students begin talking sub-
stantial numbers of practicum cre-
dits in the same department, how-
ever, Smith noted, ”it is no longer
introductory but repetitive."

Although members of the depart»
ments of Theatre and Music poin»
ted out that the rationale for prac-
tlca has long since superseded that
original concept, they indicated sub-
stantive agreement with the pro-
posal.

James Wyly, Associate Professor
of Music, observed that the new
limitation would have little effect
on the two departments since 8 cre-
dits is already the current limif
tation for practicum credits in one
department. \

Earlier, Associate Professor of
Theatre Sandy Moffett had distrib-
uted to the faculty 8 statement
in basic agreement with the prOr
posed Brcredit limitation.

Chipping Away

Student Brad Clompus spoke to
the faculty in opposition to the
move, saying that practicum cree
dlt has “immeasurably broadened"
his own’Grinnell education, and that
ii the faculty sees it as “second-
class credit" it should state the
issue as such and not go “chip»
ping away" at pi-actica in hypo»
critical fashion.

Most faculty members, however,
indicated that student statements
to the Academic Standing Committee
had indicated that the studentstheme
selves regarded practica inalesser
light than regular courses.

All of which was not to indicate
that the activities themselves were
disapproved “The question of whee
ther or not we will give credit for
some activities is not the same
as whether or not the college en»
dorses them,” pointed out Gene
Wubbcls, Associate Professor of
Chemistry.

Newly-elected EPC student reprer
sentative Leonard Kurz argued that
many students see expansion ofpra»
cticn as a way of opening up the
college to “innovations and newpror
grains,”

Physics professor Beryl Clots
ielter, however, argued that to give
practica credit for various types
of work experience would alter the
college's academic directin, “That
is not the kind of business the col-
lege should be in.” He did add,
however, that such experience may
be valuable In itself.

Following an unsuccessful attempt
by French Professor John Klein-
schmidt to table the motion until
next September, the proposal pas-
sed by a vote of 2941—5.

Divisional EPC’S
The proposal to eliminate the di-
visional EPC'S came from the Fa-
culty Organization Committee, The
original motion, as presented by
committee chairman John Dawson,
provided that one faculty member
from each division be designated
as EPC representative, and that
that person would be responsible

'for receivmg course proposals irom

individual departments and forward—
ing them with additional relevant in-
formation to the all-college EPC.

The proposal eliminates all Student
input at the divisional level,
Abolishment of divisional EPC's,
said Dawson, is necessary because
the committees are currently “a
poor use of faculty and student
time” and because “the device has
not succeeded in effective curri‘e
cular planning.”

”The department,” noted Dawson,
“is the center of initiative." Such
an elimination, he added, could be
seen as “raising the question as to
what the divisional level sllould be

NUMBER 31

Students Protest
Focuify’s Actions

by John Wylie

Dean Waldo Walker's final open forum of the year produced an
SGA recommendation for structural changes in the college gov-
ernment coupled with threats of strong action it negotiations with
the faculty, administration, and trustees do not begin shortly.

Walker and Faculty Organization Committee Chairman John Dawson
came under heavy attack from a group oi students assembled Wednesday
night in South Lounge for the faculty action Monday reducing the maximum
number of practica credits allowed towards completion of degree require-
ments and the elimination of the divisional EPC’S.

SGA President Scott Weil presen-
ted in six part plan to the meeting
which would make the all-campus
EPC a standing committee of the
College and Trustees, rescind the
two actions taken at Monday's he,
ulty meeting, and begin the process
oi establishing a community governr
ment at Grinnell

Brad Clompus then presented the
“lever" developed by Weil and other
individual cabinet members -- dis-
tribution of a letter to incoming fr-
eshmen that would “expose the false
premises that Grinnell presents th-
rough its admissions material”.

Student leaders have decided that,
tor the time being, a proposed
letter to high school guidance coun-
selors will not be sent.

Weil would not release the text of
the letter to either the $513 or the
Joint Boards of the SSA, claiming
that it was only a working document
and that it had to be kept secret
“for the good of Grinnell” until and
unless it was actually used.

While remaining uncommitted on
the tactics used, the Joint Boards
gave Weil and the Cabinet its un—
animous support on the issues rai-
sed at the open meeting earlier.

CAB: Youth Fares Die June I

by John Wylie

Airline youth fares will end within
one year unless legislation to pre-
serve the special rates is passed
by Congress before June 1

According to an announcement from
the Civil Aeronautics Board, special
discount youth and family plnnfares
will start being phased out on that
date, with further increases sctier
duled at six month intervals.

Under the plan, all youth and fam-
ily discount fares would be elimi-
nated by June 1, 1974.

According to spokesman for lowa
Senator Dick Clark, there are cur
rentiy hearings being held by the
Senate Aviation Subcommittee on fir
ve separate pieces of legislation
which would continue the special
rates.

The spokesman said that there was
a very strong reaction to the can
announcement, and that it appeared
some kind of legislation would be
approved prior to the June 1 dead-
1' e.

ailernnon between 1-4 pm. in South

The most sweeping proposal,
51705, would provide special dis-
count fares not only [or those under
21, but also handicapped persons,
and persons over 65, Under the
proposal, not only airlines but also
bus and rail companies would be
required to have the special fares.

Under the present CAB ruling,
youth discounts, whicharecurrently
25% for reserved space and 33%
ior standby, would be cut to 17%
and 22%, respectively in June. The
discounts would be out again in
December, 1973, and eliminated 31,
together the following June.

A spokesman for the Grinnell’l‘ra-
vel Center said Wednesday thatthey
have received no official notifica-
tion of the CAB ruling.

She added that the Travel Center
would continue to make bookings
under the present fare structure
until told officially not to do so.
if prices for tickets are changed,
she concluded, the passenger would
have to be notified.

mics, iewelry, prints, painting and other original works.

Reaction

Dean Walker refused to make any
immediate statement about his re-
action to the forum, noting that such
a reaction would require careful
thought.

Walker told the SkB Thursday
that he could make no statement
until president Glenn Leggett reA
turns to Grinnell, and until he and
Leggett can meet with Faculty Ch—
airman Phillip Kintner, members
of the Executive Council, and other
concerned partie .

Leggett, who is in New York on
a fund-raising trip and business
for the College Entrance Examina- .
tion Board (cars), oi which he is
the chairman, was informed of the
developments by telephone late w .
dnesday night. He plans to mal .
lain his original schedule, and re»
turn to Grinnell late this afternoon.

Meeting Comments

Student comments at the Wednes—
day meeting focused on four basic
issues: faculty responsibility and
ability to govern, the position of
student input and authority in acae
demic and personnel matters, the
effectiveness and value of Divis-
ional EPC’S, and the Worth of cre-

dits for practicum.

Many students blasted the taculty
as irresponsible and unable to gov~
ern itseli, citing the low turnout
at faculty meetings, such as the one
Monday attended by only as voting
members.

Walker responded to the comment
on low attendance by noting that he,
too. thought this was unfortunate.
The faculty had a quorum rule dur-
ing the first part oi the year, he
added, but the regulation had been
dropped when faculty members found
it virtually impossible to maintain
a quorum.

His answer did little to satisfy
the students, who then turned their
attack against Dawson. The Chair,
man of the Faculty Organization
Committee defended the faculty a»
ginst the charges of irresponsibil-
ity and incompetence, claiming that
the group did a great deal of work
in a year, although much was done
at the committee level.

However, in response to a poin-
ted question from Weil, he did
comment that, “at times, we’re not
a very eiiicient group”.

Some students demanded to know
why student input was systemati-
cally being eliminated. Both Walker
and Dawson denied the charge, say-
ing that they considered such input
extremely valuable.

However, they drew a distinction
between input and power, claiming
students were being “protected from
the faculty” by being removed irom
any personnel dealsions.

Newly elected EPC representative
Leonard Kurz then charged that the
present system, in which current
faculty have most of the input onwho
