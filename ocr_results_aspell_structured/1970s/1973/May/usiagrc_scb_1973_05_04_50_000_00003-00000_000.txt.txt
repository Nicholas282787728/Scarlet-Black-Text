Record Rip-offs Rampant

Record theits at KDlC-FM have reached epidemic proportions, as
any station listener can testify. According to Station Manager Dale
Sclerler, the station is able to keep only a fraction of its new
records lor more than a day or two,

"We actually have fewer jazz and soul albums today than we had
at the beginning oi the year -- despite the {act that we are getting
good record service from the jazz and soul labels”, Scherler

told the. 5&8.

The station receives a number of listener complaints about
the small record library, and Scherler blames most of them on the

record riproff problem.

“Most of the requests we get are for albums that were in the
station library at one time or another. But people keep “borrowA
ing" the dlbums,.,and that ls usually the last KDIC sees of them".

Scherler stressed that KDIC albums are actually community
property for the Grinnell campus, and are therefore best used
when they are in the station library.

“They aren't really doing anybody any good at home, except the

guy that stole them".

KDIC is attempting to improve its library, and Scherler asks
that anybody in the campus community who knows the where—
abouts of a station record return it to the station.

“It isn’t even necessary to ask their permission”, he commen-
ted. “After all -- did they bother to ask permission when they

stole it

Impact Study Printed

by In SEE stun writer

Excerpts from a study by students
Richard Buddin and John Hansen
concerning the economic impact at
Grinhell College on thetown ofGrin-
nell have been published in the Apr
ril, 1973 issue of College and uni-
versity Business magazine.

The study, which was completed
last Summer under the direction of
Economics PraiessorRobert Voertr
man, concluded that collegerrelated
buying brings over $3 million worth
of business into the Grinnell com-
munity, and that the total of college-
stimulated business volume amounts
to almost $6 million.

Following the lines of a model
developed by John Caffrey and Her-
bert H. Isaacs under the auspices
of the American Council on Educa-
tion, the Study analyzed local bus-
inesses and college records to es-
timate the monetary impact of the
college on the Community

already elicited four requests from
college presidents throughout the

Joint Boards Meet; Budget Approved

by Mike Breed

The new Joint Boards kicked Off
their term Wednesday night witna
meeting in the South Lounge. Fol-
lowing introductory remarks by Fr-
esident Scott Weil they dealt with
upper level appointments and with
next year’s budget.

After introducing himself and his
Vice Presidents Weil reviewed the
failures of last years J-B, saying
that the cabinet had tried to push
through programs about which last
year’s House Presidents were under
informed, thereby creating an at»
mosphere at mistrust. He called on
this year's House Presidents to
‘work together’ with the cabinet.

He also outlined three areas which
he thought would be ofmajor concern
to the new board. First, he called
for an investigation of SAGA load
service and an exploration or alter—
natives to SAGA; second, he called
for a similar investigation of the
Health Center and an effort to make
it more responsive to student's
needs; and finally he called for a
review of SGA committees to make
them more responsive to the cam-
pus community.

This was followed by the approval
of Joe Genereux and Bob Ruhlastne
new Student Coordinators. Some one
jections were raised about the phil—
osophy behind the operations of the
Coordinator's office; until now it
has been viewed as independent of
the sea cabinet, and the new ap-
pointees will function as part of the
cabinet, but the appointments were
passed by a 13~3~0 vote.

Appointments of Ed Hirsch as tre»
asurer, Celestine Bloomfield as So—
cial Coordinator, and of Henry Ja-
mes, Pam Jagnow, and Sybille Scott
as Assistant Student Coordinators
were also approved.

The appointment of Don Bognanno
as 3 Judicial Council member was

the perfect

occasion

Applications for the position will be
re-opened and a committee (ii House
Presidents was chosen to do the
interviewing.

Jack Doppelt was approved as the
editor of the faculty evaluation book-
let to be published by SGA. He pre
sented samples of an objective ques—
tionnaire to be distributed by .Ile
faculty evaluation committeeand ex—
plained that information would also
be gathered through the EPC’s.

The main item at business was
approval of next year’s budget. Tre-
asurer Ed Hirschpresented the bud-
get and explained that it was basis
cally the same as last year’s, with
a few salary cuts and an increase
in the Social Coordinating budget

SGA accounts are to be funded
at $2,715, a reduction of $207 from
last year. This reduction comes
mainly from the elimination of the
SGA secretary, whose duties have
been taken over by the Student
Coordinator’s ofﬁce, and a reduc—
tion on some of the other salaries,
Salary levels for the coming year
are $350 for the President and Vice
presidents, $300 apiece for the
Coordinators, $150 apiece for the
Assistant Coordinators, and $150 for
the Treasurer. ‘

Each hall will receive $5.10 for
each student living in that hall; this
is the same level as this year.

Public Events committee, which
sponsored events such as the Pro
Musica this year, suffered a cut
from $7500 to $5000.

KDIC was cut approximately $400.
with the assurance that they could

ask for more money if they had
major equipment breakdowns. The
KDiC Station Manager received 3300
in salary, the Program Director
$200, the Chief Engineer $300, am
the Production Manager $l50.

The Auditor’s Office was cut from
$730 to $640. This was because of
salary reductions for the Auditor
and his Assistant.

The Cyclone will receive $300 in
the coming year. One thousand dol-
lars was appropriated for the rac-
ulty evaluation booklets, with the
understanding that the booklets wu-
uld be sold in order to regain some
of this expense.

Social Coordinators budget was
increased $4,300, in hopes 01 Im-
proving the offerings next year.

Roman coinage was changed to cop-
per and washed with l to 2 per cent
silver. Thls resulted in rampant
inflation and a return to the bar»
for system. And this, Patterson
contended, was one of the contrib-
uting factors in the fall of the R0-
man Empire.

The remainder of the two day ses—
sion was spent on sectional ses-
sions (ranging from Conservation
to Economics), dinner, and the pre»
sentation of awards.

This was the iirst time in the Ac-

nell had hosted the annual meeting.
Professor Irving Fishman handled
arrangements for the gathering.
