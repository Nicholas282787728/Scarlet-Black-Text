in hindsight to be most perceptive: “l'm

in February, student concern over an in.
dependent policy statement by Dean Walker
quickly iaded into the background when a
Marine Corps recruiter, one Captain Pair
row of Des Moines, visited the campus torn
day to discuss Marine careers with Grin-
nell students. Although several students
with genuine interest in the Marines had
interviews, a group oi others conirouted
him in the Career Services Office saying
that “college campuses should remain pul'e
oi military propaganda.”

Editors of the 5818 expressed in an edi—
torial that such a restriction would give
rise 10 a Situation in which “not allinformZir

tion is available” and students would “have‘

to base theirthought processes on one.sided
intermatlon.” While other students expres-
sed basic agreement with the editorial
stance, an open discussion ollhe question
in the South Lounge a iew days later re—
vealed widespread disagreement over the
issue.
Communications Department

The real issue of the Spring, however,
was the question of the Communications
Department. Established only last year
as a combination oi speech, journalism,
and general medialofferlngs, the Depart-
ment was the subject of intensive review
during the first semester and was evens
tually given a stamp of disapproval by the
Executive Council.

Fund Cutdiis

Oi concern throughout the Spring was action
by the Nixon administration to cut support—
ing {nods to colleges and universities th-
roughout the nation. Grinnell itself stood
to lose about $300,000 or available lunds,
according to President Leggetl, and most
altected was the popular l-LITE program
or interlibrary exchange, part' ipated in by
several colleges and universities in Iowa.
Meanwhile, the campus securityissuegrew
in proportion lollowing the thelt or stereo
equipment irom student rooms one April
weekend, students conlronted Dean Walker
with the problem in one oi his open (drums,
and in a large meeting in ARH Auditorium
the next week thedisciission continued. SeVr
eral proposals were aired, until the issue
was linally resolved with the institution or
security patrol to Cover both ends of cam—
pus on weekend evenings, The patrol began
on May 4.

Black Student Housing
SGA President Scott Well, who attained
a narrow election victory over two oppon—
ents in February, soon faced the iirst cri.
sis ol his new administration: the black
housing problem. Although the Joint Board
and SGA oiiicials endorsed and implemen»
ted the “cluster system” oi housing, which

getting a job alter graduation? OI attending
the graduate school oi our choice? in short,
”Is there llie atter Grinnell?“

An sols poll taken shortly beiore the end
or the year indicated that seniors were
on the whole cautiously optimistic about
their iutures. 35% wishing to go to gradur
ate schools had been accepted, the survey
revealed, and 73% oi those got into their
iirst choice school 01 those who wanted a
job, 55% expected to iind the kind oi work

The sheet such experiences will have on
our iuture lives is uncertain, but low or us
can say that we didn’t go through a great
deal or change here. We may like it or
despise it, but we will certainly never tor.
get it.

In a key faculty meeting on February 20
over two hundred students showed up to
oppose the proposal, but after a consider
able amount of debate the faculty accepted
by a narrow margintne recommendationthat
the department be “disestablished.”Des-
pile further student efforts to thwart the
proposal before the Board of Trustees, the
Trustees voted four weeks later to approve
the action.

Despite the loss of the department, stur
dent opposition to the disestablishment
represented the most organized student
movement ot the year.

Sports

In Spring sports action, the Ploneersfared

little hotter than in the fall. The basketball

had been in eiiect since '71-72, problems
in the procedure and basic disagreements
over the system itsell created a great deal
or concern.

Following an editorial in the sol: which
called the system “a dangerous extension
at a bad idea,” students wrote a long
series of letters to the paper over the
housing situation and blaclewhlte relations
in Grinnell overall. The letters revealed
an element or discontent and uneasiness
over race relations which had until that
time remained largely beneath the sur—
face.

Outlook
