Nightingale Supports lettuce Boycott

To the Editors:

I ieel that i must speak out in far
vor oi the lettuce boycott. Persons
ally, i do not feel that 99.9% at the
people, let alone 67%, have the
right to tell others how they must
live, Yet I see the boycott ot letr
tuce (and grapes) as a moral is,
sue, and because it is a moral is
sue, it should be treated differently.
i may be challenging a person’s
ireedom to eat lettuce, but I also
feel that a iundamental part oi in-
dividual freedom is the ability to
makeimoral decisions.

The farm workers are fighting
not only for better wages and liv-
ing conditions, but also for respect
and human dignity. Anyone who has
seen any of several documentar-
ies on migrant workers has surely
been insensed by the condition they
are in. And the fact that their chil-
dren are inevitably bound tothe land
produces only a perpetual serfdom.
Who among us would ieel dignified
as a slave, picking food tor others
to gorge on?

I have seen students become upset
about Vietnam and Kent State, being
in the minority, yet demanding that
these are moral issues. BobShields
asks, ”Why can’t the students be
allowed to decide the question ior
themselves?" A wishy-washy type

- solution like this will not work.
Most students _really do not think
about what is happening as they
pass the salad table. After all, how
is my not eating a bowl of lettuce
going to do anything? The time
has come to do something person—
ally. Commitment is an act, not a
ward. It is hard to say if it will
change things, but to take a stand
and show where your loyalties lie,
is something which is necessary,
particularly at Grinnell, where we

I really don't enjoy playing the
role of a test case, but the prinr

college newspaper and whom the
paper is written for is critical.

The issue of using a real name

having to lace the immediacy oi cere
tain situations.

I am speaking of sacriiice, and oi
commitment, Yes, 1 am a vegetar-
ian, and yes, I do not like leatlet-
tuce. But it surpasses my under:
standing why someone would be op-
posed to killing animals, yet silent
to the oppression of his fellow
man. ‘

We are all part of the system.
We may not change it, but by com
mitment we may enable ourselves
not to take part in it, Camus said,
“Our brothers are breathing under
the Same sky as we, justice is a
living thing”. As long as there are
individuals who are willing to sac-
rifice and commit themselves to a
cause in the name oi justice, denoun-
cing a scheme of things which favors
oppression and suiiering, justice
will live. But it can just as easily
die, The lettuce boycott is only one
small example oi the struggle. But
it is a necessary one. Please, vote
yes to boycott grapes and lettuce.

It took a while to get to, but It
finally noticed President Leggett’s
remarks about the Communications
Department, or more to the point,
the lack of it. His point, it seems,
was that the absence of the departe
merit as such was going to stimur
late the communications programs.
Grinnell College could analyze the
situation and initiate studies in thee
se areas. Now, l'm not a college
president or anything, but 1 sort
of had to scratch my head at that
logic. Why did we have to elimi-
nate the department to examine
programs needed? How are we to
do better without the department?

An analogy might be made that
Leggett seems to be telling us that
we can drive better if we throw
away our car. What is ominous,
however, is that the ”logic” of his
statement could be carried to its
conclusion. Maybe we could have a
better fine arts program Without the
departments,

After all, we could stick voicelesA
sons in the biology department. And
how about American studies, or poll-
tical science, or sociology? Just
think of the great College we could
have if we got rid Of all the depart-
ments...HMMM.

Two articles buried behind the d»H
headlines in the Des Moines Register
recently clicked in this writer's
mind. First, the army is short oi
volunteers. Second, a certain air
iorce general recently redecorated
his private plane with racing stripes,
a freezer, carpeting, and of course,
a trash masher. Not that I object,
mind you, the importance of neat
trash is paramount to the military,
we mustn’t fall behind the Russians,
and have you ever had a gin and
tonic without ice...Yech.

However, it seems like the mili~
tary could solve its enlistment pro
oblems by using some of the met»
hods above that are presently only
being used by the brass. How about
customized tanks for the hottroddr
ers? Think of all that wasted wood
on rine stocks, maybe a handcar.

sort or like the warning on a cig-
arette pack, it you can’t take it,
turn to the Sports Page.

Anyway, one point made at the la-
culty colloquium was that Ameri-
can politics have lost their civil-
ity. i believe a large part oi this
civility is the ability to understand
and respect opposing points ofview.
This was lost to Nixon and com-
pany, and I’m afraid to the Grin-
nell community. l have talked to

Rhetoric . ..
Unlimited

too many students who hate cer-
tain politicians simply because they
don’t like their opinions,

Senator x is simply not an honor-
able man who has a different value
system, he has to be, ior too many
people, a redneck fascist; or a per-
verted communist. Why the hell is

it so hard for Grinnell students to
respect, say, int. Grass for his
strong beliefs about federal spend-
ing. even if they violently disagree
with it. It sometimes seems that
only politicians have any respect
for each other. Idealistic student
types attack the opposing politicians
who debate against each other for
hours, and then have lunch toget-
her. This is the way it should be.
Those persons not lost in their own
rhetoric may have noticed that con-
frontation politics haven’t been an
exactly spectacular success.
Undoubtedly, those of you who have
read this far are shaking your
heads from side to side, not us.
As a political dissident on this
campus, however, I would say that
Grinnell is as narrow-minded as
any stereo-typed southern small
town. it is enough to oppose a per<
son, while still respecting him, to
have the urge to reduce a political
opponent to a sub»human level is
beyond normal politics and distinct-
ly lacking in any sort oi civility.
in addition, on the pragmatid level,
it achieves nothing.

the Grinnell Relevancy Pogrom

by J. C. Woods

I am a black and therefore at Gre
innell l’ve had quite a few advane
tages. First, as soon as I arrived
here I had to adjust from the urbanv
Southern, predominantly black-peo-
pled environment in which I was
born and reared, to a rural-Nor-
thern predominantly white-peopled
environment--a change I took im-
mediately in stride.

Secondly, i, like so many students
here, found myself unable to afford
Gi’innell, even on a full scholar-
ship, So I was given a job at SAGA
and I used the money from it to
provide me sustenance.

Lastly, I entered the classroom and
discovered my greatest resource--
the Memphis City School System,
especially the inner-city (black) sc-
hool, doesn't prepare their students
for Memphis State, much less Grin-
nell. But I applied myself diligently
to my work and now i, by estima-
tion, am considered a match for 75%
of the student body‘in literary prowA
ess (considering Mr. Youngberg’s
letter, this iigure may be higher).

When I got here two years ago,l
couldn't’ write a stop sign. Now you
are probably wondering why 1 call
the above advantages. 1 am sure

that you are a white-suburban‘mid»

' The Implications 0f Applications

by Michele Rathenberg

Applications are one of the most
frustrating activities invented. Per-
sonally, lhave known very t‘ew people
who actually enjoy filling out appli—
cations. Ask any senior whois about
to apply to graduate school or for
a job what their feelings are on
applications, -

Most likely the adjectives will
range from mundane, mediocre, and
trivial to meshugge, bothersome,
and ridiculous. For that matter,
ask any ireshinan, transier stud-
ent, or independent major,

Although there are various types
of applications, unfortunately, one
does not get a choice, Some are
rather innocuous, simply asking for
name, mother’s name, father’s
name, date of birth, and address.
(or other variations on that order.)
Then there are job applications
which ask for informatiun un Dne’s
schooling, school applications which
ask for information an Dne's jobs
(and other responsibilities), essay
applications, research grant applie
cations, loan applications, housing
applications, independent major ap—
plications,

Some app lca ions can prove to be
a great source of entertainment and
conversation. Occasionally it is kind
or interesting to debate possible
answers to absurd questions or to
attempt to out—guess the form, Ano-
ther possible activity is to speculate
on the answers of fellow applicants.
Actually, one might begin to wonder

why nobody has invented “The Ap- ,

plication Game,” where the contes-
tant with the most appropriate (-ly
absurd) answers gets a free visit
with a psychologist.

(i wonder if the complexity of an
institution can be measured by the
number of applications it provides?)

Grinnell (fortunate college that it
is) has an abundance otapplications.
Atter admission, one can apply to
iinancial aid, a job, a leave-ole
absence, nffvcampus study, a stur
dent advisor position, committees,
independent study projects, and in-
dependent majors. Of this list, there
are two which Will serve as good
examples, no offense meant to the
ose who design them.

Student Advisor applications trade
itionally inquire, ”Why do you wish
to be a student advisor?” This qu-
estion has two basic answers: 1)
Because I want to help other peo-

jor questions prompting the
proposal and the majorthemes
that unity the proposal intoa
coherent body of study and
investigation.
I iind it very tempting to reply to
the first portion of the previous qu-
estion with a simple answer suchas,
“Ever since I was a childlwanted
to find out how Cities operate and
that .is why i would like to major
in Urban Studies,” Although this is
not actually the exact case, the
question prompts innumerable eq-
ually disastrous responses.
Although it seems that applications
are inextricably a part oi contem-
porary society, it can also be the
the bane of one’s existence.

Now things become tricky, how do

you phrase number one in a unique'

way, and how do you disguise num-
ber two? Fortunately the selection
committee does not base its sel-
ection solely upon these written
applications.

“Independent Major Application Fo»
