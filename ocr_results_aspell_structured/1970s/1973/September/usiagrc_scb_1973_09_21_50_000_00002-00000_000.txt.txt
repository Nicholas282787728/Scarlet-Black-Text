Workshop Gets In Focus

by Douglas Halsey and Dianna ott

Atter much discussion on propos-
als and Counterproposals and atre-
mendous amounbof individual eifort
on the part oi its student coordinr
ator, lion Silverman, |heI Grinnell
Photography Workshop will become
a reality early next week.

The date is unsur says Silver~

'man, because potential workshop
members still have to be inter
viewed by the three coordinators,
Jon silverman, Lucia McMillan and
Doug Halsey. However, Silverman
hoped that this would be completed
by Monday, As soon as the 20 meme
hers oi the Workshop are selected,
the darkroom in Steinel llall will
be made available |o lhern.

Ever since the photography course
at Grinnell was discontinued last
year, concerned photographer Jon
Silverman has been working to es,
tablish a photography workshop on
campus. It’s very close to reality
now, scheduled to open next week

The workshop will be operated in
the darkroom localed in the bases
ment of Steiner Hall and will Offer
lessons in photography to beginners.
it will also provide n much needed
darkroom for the use of serious
photographers not connected with
the Scarlet and Black and Cyclone
staffs
A fee oi $15 per semester will
be required from participants to
cover the costs of chemicals and
paper.

Up to 20 people will be able to
participate in this early stage Sp~
ace is a big problem now, and as

the workshop iinds space to eit-
pand, greater numbers will be able
to participate, Selection ot partic-
ipants will be based on their ser-
ious intentions about photography

' Silverman chose a quote tromiohn

Szarkowski’s Looking at Phologra-
phs — lUU photographs train the Mu-
seum of Modern Art to sum up his
feelings. "It can be said with car»
tainty only that photography has re-
mained ior a century and a quar»
ter one or the most radical, in-
structive, disruptive, influential,
problematic, and astonishing phen-
omena of the modern epic."

Silverman, who will co-direct the
workshop along with Doug Halsey
and Lucian McMillan, feels that it’s
“adisgrace the.5chcol doesn't have
instruction in photography".

He reels that photography is an
art and that it “should have a pie
ace in the art department”.

“The purpose oi the workshop,"
Silverman says, "is to encourage
the clear intelligent communication
and development of ideas related to
photography and a practical under
standing oi, and respect tor, the
tools, processes, and techniques
oi photography. In other words, th—
ose involved with the workshophope
to become creative photographic
thinkers and skilled photographic
craftsmen.”

Regular critique sessions will be
planned to evaluate the work of the
participants, and as soon as it can
be organized, an exhibit oi their
work will be on display 'in the
College Forum.

Grinnell History Preserved

by Laura Miller

Unpublished manuscripts oi the
famous Irish poet William Butler
Yeats, preserved in the Grinnell
Room at burling Library, recently
were rediscovered by a visiting pro-
iessor from’ wtttenberg University
in Springtield, onto,

Professor Conrad A. Balliet and
his wiie spent several dayslast
week searching tor material on
Yeat‘s lover Maud Gonne, apuhlic
iigure who iought {orlreland'sfreer
dom. Ealllet has been,working on
her biography tot-the past twoyears,
and is planning his third trip to
Dublin this summer. ,

The transcripts originally were
copied by Grinnell ProfessorCurtis
Bradford while on leave lll Dublin.
However, Yeat’s tamily ever since
has refused permission to publish
them.

Restrictions have been placed on

, the manuscripts, and so they re
main locked in the recesses of the
purling basement, surrounded by a
iascinating collection ol priceless
booksvand Writings which fill the
Grinnell Room and vault.

The Grinnell Room holds a collec-
tion which vividly recounts the his-
tory of the school — photographs,
scrapbooks, yearbooks, and newspa-
pers irom the end ot the last Cen-
tury. There are pictures of Mears

SGA Debate Drinking, Hobbs

SCA has found an appropriateplacc
to hold its meetings. it is not in
the austere, business-like confines
of ARH nor is it in the friendly,
informal South Lounge No, it is
instead in the murky, drunken ate
mosphere of the newly opened Pub,
It was there that the Joint Board
meeting was held Wednesday, and
the long hidden rowdiness oi SGA
iinally was tlaunted.

Significantly, nothing of real imr
portance emerged irom the meete
ing. Most time-consuming were the
approval of a new campus drinkr
ing regulation and the non»approval
of a committee appointment The
remainder of the meeting was com-
posed or simple reports and a more
usual routine oi rubberstamping oi
committee appointments.

At issue in the new drinking reg»

ulation was a clause prohibiting
drinking at public (as opposed to
college) events, Several members
at the Boards asked it this wasn’t
really a restrictive measure in what
was supposed to be a recognition
oi the actual drinking practices,

Rick Faust, a member olthe Comm—
ittee on Social policies and Regula-
tions, replied that the disputed proe
vision merely made the written par
licy legal Actually, there will be
no more euiorcement than beiore,
i.e none. As aptly summed by John
Potts, “I’m sure we would drink
wherever we‘d please betore and
I‘m sure we will do exactly the
same.”

But when it came to approving
Craig Hobbs as New Student Days
co»chairman, SGA did not do the
same. Led by Martha kosher, a
wave of criticism concerning Hobb‘s
past periormance on the committee
soon swept the meeting in the enr
suing vote, Mears, Cleveland, Ja-
mes, Read. Loose (l), Cowles and

Norris (2) contributed to a 13-] !
rejection or the appointment. A new
selection committee was composed
of Joint Board members that 'will
try to find a more acceptable candle

Comyns added, “I've always th.»
ought oi' Nader’s efforts as being
too distant from me and to hear
someone who worked closely there,
just kind of made it come alive."

Along with enthusiasm, many idv
eas came out of the weekend in
the woods. "I came out with num-
erous ideas tor our local," Kathy
said. One of these ideas had to do
with forming a community aware-
ness committee associated with SGA
so that perhaps the two organiza-
tions can work together.

She said that she thinks the local
will be much more effective this
year. “We have more people willr
ing to help organize and with this
larger core group we can get a
lot more done," she said. “The
potential is all right there,”

Smith, who is new to lSPlRG, res
marked that she felt more encour-

aged about projects. “But in a way .

it was discouraging when i saw how
much there is to be done,”

Smith, who will work mainly with
co-ordinating the survival projects,
said that she felt she was really see-
ing ”what's at the centerofthe orga-
nization--as far as staff, and as
tar as how it’s organized ” “I got
the idea about what ISPIRG is really
about- ~the idea oi looking around and
iindihg things wrong in the system
and trying to correct them by work
ing within the system," she said.

Comyns, also a newcomer, said
that the retreat gave her “a sense
of how much impact ISPIRG can
really have.” “I became aware at
what potential the group has,” she
said, “It gave me a perspective
really,”

The retreat also gave her a sense
oi direction into which way she can
go with ISPIRG. “It got me inter-
ested in nuclear energy and the idea
of a nuclear moratorium," she ex»
plained, “I can help by finding out
the iacts myseli and then making ot-
her people aware too." ,

She concluded, now feel sor

He sums up his philosophy by not-

Greenberger, another newcomer to
ISPIRG, said that the retreat gave
her “a much greater understanding
at what lSPlRG really is and the
power it really has--especially on
a statewide basis, "It gave me an
understanding of the abilities of the
people working for lsleG——very
fine and talented people running the
organization,” she continued, “I
kept thinking that herelam spending
(or wasting) $4000 a year on school
and they’re living on and doing all
those things ior $4000 a year. it
just shows real dedication.“

the survival projects, because they
don‘t take so much time and eff-
ort, will be really good for getting
people involved.

she continued “If people‘only real-
