Faculty Refuses Commission

by John Wylie

Grinnell’s faculty voted Overs
whelmingly Monday to reyect a mo
tion by Joseph Wall to authorize the
creation of a commission to study
the role of students in academic
governance.

By a vote of 27 to 48 with 5 ab-
stentions, faculty members defeated
a plan that would have created a
special ad hoc committee appointed
by the President of the College,
chaired by the Dean, and consiste
ing of two taculty and two students.
Student leaders viewed the defeat
as a direct faculty slap at students,
but some faculty members analyzed
the vote as nothing more than fa-
culty determination to guard their
prerogatives against administration
encroachment.

One such iaculty member noted that
the proposal, as stated, called for
the President to name the two fac~
ulty members of the commissione—
a function normally performed by the
faculty organization committee.

He added that the faculty right to
appoint their own committee mem-
bers was thejealouslyguarded back-
bone of iaculty political power, and
this consideration was a major
cause of the Wall proposal's de-
feat,

Debate

Debate centered on several major
issues: proper level ot student in—
put in various areas or College go-
vernance, the communications pro-
blem between students and faculty,
and the proper forum for discussing
changes in the governmental struc-

ture.

Debate on the proposal was wide-
ranging alter the meeting was chang»
ed proceduraily, from a iaculty
meeting to a meeting ofacommittee
of the whole, to consider the broad
issues.

Wall began the debate by reminding
his colleagues of the historical con—
text of his motion. He noted that
no real examination of governance
has been undertaken since the Betts
committee four years ago.

The current Sub-Committee on Ed-
ucational Policies of the Executive
Council was one outgrowth of this
Committee, he noted, and that body
was established on a trial basis.

However, no review of the body’s
effectiveness had been attempted by
the faculty, despite the trial nature
of the Allrcampus EPC.

He concluded by describing his pro-
posal as “modest" and expressing
surprise at the “depth of opposi—
tion” to it. ,

But John Dawson, Chairman of the
Faculty Organization Committee,
argued that the issue was a sub
stantative one, concerning the cone
stitutional system under which Grin—
nell functions,

stressing that he was speaking as
an individual, Dawson said a commi—
ttee composed equally 0! students
and faculty would probably produce
a report advocating similar equall—
ty in academic governance, a “sta-
tus that is not be be."

In a document issued earlier in
the day on behalf of the Committee,
Dawson made a clear distinction
between student input and student
responsibility. He cited the former
as extremely Valuable, but said the
latter was a matter for “the pro
fessionalism 0f the Faculty and Ad
ministration" because they were
professionally accountable for aca—
demic decisions.

Robert Voertman argued inanother
document that the real issue, which
had been placed in terms of plac-

(APR) basis The law is designed
to allow consumers to “shop for

on the same basis at all institur
tions, the report says,

However, the ISPIRG study claims
that some lenders are answering
telephone inquiries with rates fig-
ured under the “addeon” or “dis
count” interest systems.

Under the add—on system, aperson
taking a $100 loan with 5% addron
interest would receive $100 but pay
annual interest on $105.

Under the discount system, with a
5% rate, the $100 borrower would
receive only $95, but would pay
annual interest on the higher am-
cunt.

Either system, quoted alone, pro-
vides a deceptively low interest fi-
gure, according to the ISPIRG re-
Pol-t.

Siudent Charged With larceny

Senior Wayne Wiley. was arrested
Monday by Grinnell Police on a ch»
arge of larceny in connection with
the theft of a bicycle.

Wiley was arrested at about 4:15
pm. near the Gibson’s store in
downtown Grinnell alter the bicy»
cle's Owner, senior Charles Taylor,
recognized his property and called
police.

Wiley will appear in Magistrate‘s
Court here tomorrow, at which time
the exact charge will be determined.
If the charge is grand larceny, the
case will be referred to District
Court, otherwise, it will be handled
at the magistrate level.

Wiley is tree on personal recog-
nizance pending his court date.

Taylor says the bicycle was par-

ing more “power" over academi-
affairs in the hands of students, was
actually one of communication.

As such, he continued, it was .
matter that should be handled in a
regular fashion through existing
channels.

President Speaks

As debate neared its end, Presie
dent Glenn Leggett, speaking irom
a prepared text, said that the pre-
sent distribution of power appeared
proper,

However, he said that major por-
tions of the structure were operat—
ing on an ad hoc or temporary ba-
sis, and added that students Should
have a prerogative “for aposition
articulated and recognizable beyond
our rather ad hoc present way of
operating." .
Aiter several parliamentary mo-i
ves, Allan Jones suggested that the
issue was important enough to be
considered by the faculty asa comm-
ittee of the whole for several meet-
ings.

His idea was defeated, however, on
a show of hands vote. As the 6:00
adjournment deadline rapidly app»,
roached, Wall’s motion was pre-
sented unamended, and, was defeated .
on a secret ballot vote (moved by
Dawson),
