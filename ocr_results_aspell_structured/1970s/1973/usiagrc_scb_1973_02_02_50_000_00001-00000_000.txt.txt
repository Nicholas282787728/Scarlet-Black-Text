Much Stolen Furniture

by Don nagenais

Under pressure from the Office
of the Dean of Student Affairs nu-
merous students have been returns
ing furniture stolen from dormir
Iory lounges this week.

Although in previous years the
Office has contacted specific stu-
dents about returning furniture,this
week represents the first time that
a return policy has been put into
widespread use.

The policy was undertaken, As—
sociate Dean of Student Affairs .Iim
Tederman told the S&B Wednesday,
because of the great increase this
year in the numbers of furniture
pieces found missingfrom hallloun-
ges. An inventory conducted overthe
Christmas break discovered a total
of l54 pieces missing at an estimated
purchased value of $7700. The ac-
tual replacement value is much
higher. “The furniture is quite ex-
pensive because it is sturdy, in-
stitutional furniture” said’Teder-
man.

Approximately one-third of the
missing pieces were identified by
college maids during Christmas
break as they entered student rooms
to close windows and turn off the
radiators. Most of the pieces, how-

ever, are simply missingr»and their
whereabouts is unknown to the Ofs

lice. Tederman suspects that most

of the pieces are in off~campus a-
partments.

“If this keeps up," he said, “we
may no longer have any lounges with
furniture.” The list includes '72
chairs, 32 tables, 17 lamps and sev—
eral sofas, draperies, bookshelves,
benches, etc.

In order to retrieve the pieces
discovered in dormitory rooms by
the maids, the Office of Student
Affairs sent out a mimeographed
letter earlier this week to persons
with dormitory furniture in their
rooms. According to arrangements
made with BELG, the persons were
supposed to have returned the pieces
by 4:00 pm. Wednesday. or else
face a $l0.00 fine and have the turn»
iture removed at any time by one.

“Please understand that this letter
serves as a 24—hour notice to enter
your room if you do not follow the
above procedure,” the letter cons
eluded.

By late Wednesday afternoon, most
of the identified furniture had been
returned.

"At some Eastern schools the
problem has gotten so bad that they

Communications In Crisis

by Steve Nunn
Prospects are apparently dim for the Department of Common-

ications .
The department,

which has 22 majors, has been under evaluas

tion by the Executive Council since last fall. The Council is cons
sidering dropping the department on the grounds that it may
not be possible to replace two retiring staff members, Velma

Hiser and Herbert Prescott.

It might be better to employ the college’s resources elsewhere
“if we can’t staff the communications department as we should,”

according to the administration.

Department chairman William Vanderpool went before the Exe
cutive Council Jan. 5 to urge retention of the department, but as
of this week he had received no response from them.

This is because, the Council says, it has not made any decisions.

“The Council‘s recommendation to the President will come when

it comes,"

commented Dean Waldo Walker.

Meanwhile communications department students and faculty are
waiting, and Curt Gorrell, delegate for the communications dc»
partment on the Humanities Division EPC, thinks the Executive
Council is “overly concerned with short term goals.”

“Cut three faculty members here, kill this department, and
other departments will have that much more latitude and money

going for them,” he said.

Should the department be cut, Communications majors presums
ably would be permitted to finish out their courses of study. This
was the procedure when the college last dropped a department,
in 1969-70 when It terminated the campus ROTC program

Walker said the end of the Communications department would
not necessarily mean the end of the major. ACommunicalions
major could be done either through independent study or through
a subsdeparlmental interdisciplinary program such as those that
now exist in black studies and in urban studies, he said
Walker said the Council could have a recommendation ready
for the faculty by February or early March.

The faculty must act on the recommendation before it can go
to the Trustees, who will meet in April.

NUMBER I9

Independents Concern Campus

by Brent Schnndelmeyer

"Draw,” the man said and thus
began Dean Walker’s first of what
he hopes will not be the last, open
Forum between college students and
administrators.

Students met his challenge, firing
back endless questions all taking
aim at recent administrative action
to limit independent projects.

Dean Walker at the outset of the
Forum stated where he derived
authority to limit independents.
“Deans are empowered by the Board
of Trustees by by-laws to admins
ister the academic program of the
college." In addition, the Educationv
al Policy committee “quite clearly
stated that the Dean would monitor"
the operation of independent pro—
jects.

when asked why the dccisionto lim-
it independents was made so late
Dean Walker responded, “Mr. Wall
didn’t get his data survey completed
until about two weeks before the end

now have to bolt the furniture to
the floor," said Tederman.

Ralph Pomerenk, Director of Col-
lege Services, told the 5&8 Wed—
nesday that the college does not reg—
ularly budget money for the purchase
of furniture to replace that stolen
during the year, and that the college
has not been able in the past few
years to purchase replacement pie»
ces, although it does re upholster
old pieces to lengthen their lives.

In previous years, said Tederman,
the college has discovered that stu-
dents may steal dormitory turniture,
have it stored withthe C&K company
over the summer, then take it to
their new rooms the next year.

The Social policies Committee will
be meeting in the future to discuss
the problem further.

of the semester. . . .We really did—
n’t expect the data to be as quite
clearly cut as it was "

Beginning with the 1966-67 aca-
demic year students were enrolled

for a total of 833 credit hours of
independent work and guided reading
projects. Expanding tremendously
Over the next five years, this number
increased to 3755 credit hours for
1971-72. Associate Dean Hamilton
pointed out thatthe college currently
has a smaller faculty than in 19667
67 teaching the same nunlber of
courses, yet supervising four times
the number of independent credit
hours. independents currentlycon-
stitute one-fifth of the credit the col-
lege grants annually.

AS the evening progressed Walker
reaffirmed his position to students
not present at the beginning of the
Forum.

“We contract the faculty member
to provide us with a product and we
are the ones who are responsible
for in the final analysis assessing
whether or not that faculty member
has provided that product. We can
sit here all night and talk about
individual opinions, about whether
an individual faculty member who is
teaching 15 students on independents
and 57 students in the classroom
is offering more than another fac-
ulty member who is teaching three
students on independents and 27 stur
dents in the classroom, buI I stand
on the stated position that there
is a limit, which if thefaculty mem~
bor goes beyond the product that he
is giving the student forthe student’s
contract with the college is greatly
diminished and it is the college's
‘buSiness to monitor that product."

Many students present felt that the
faculty member could be the best
judged of his time and capabilities.
Associate Dean Hamilton remarked,
“Many of the faculty members have
felt unable to impose the kind of
limits on the independent projects
they handle that they would like to
impose. Many of them feel greatly

CONSTITUTIONAL CRISIS‘

Blame Rests with Congress

by Barry Zigas

Blame for the present Constitu-
tional crisis in the US Government
rests not with the Executive, but
with the Congress. Senators Dick
Clark, Harold Hughes, Iowa Lie-
utenam-Governor Arthur Neu, and
the Honorable Fred Schwengel rea—
ched this consensus last Sunday
before an audience of 100071500
in Des Moines’ North High Schs
001.

The occasion was a National Con-
stitutional Crisis Forum,sponsored
by 16 Iowa religious and public in-
terest groups. Moderated by Grinv
nell President Glenn Leggett, the
three-hour presentation ranged over
many problems. The main focus was,
however, the current dominance of
national government by the Presi—
dent.

The birpartisan panel found theme
selves in basic agreement concern-
ing the erosion of Congressional
power. Sen. Dick Clark spoke for
all when he opened the session by
stating that Congressional power had
steadily declined “primarily out of
a lack of will on the part of the
Senators and Congressmen,” Clark
traced the origin of the present cri—
sis to the Depression. Then, he said,
the country needed a strong Exes
cutive with “unusual powers" to
solve the massive problems of the
Depression. This mandate for strong
presidential government was ex-
tended through WW II, Korea and
the Cold War, right down to the
present,

Today the Executive is stronger
than ever before in the nation’s
history, Clark Iold the packed house
“We’re at a point," he said, “where
Congress passes laws, but the Pres-
ident implements only those he likes,
and kills those he doesn’t with the
stroke of a pen ..

Lieutenant-Governor Arthur Neu

overburdened with the independ~
ems.” The faculty is "not in the
nay saying profession" and feel
many times unable to refuse student
requests for independents.

Behind the “short term interim
expediency measure" to limit indEs
pendants are more fundamental
questions. In response to a com»
ment by a student for the need “to
set up a better independent pro-
gram” Dean Walker replied. “I
couldn't agree with you more." Dean
Walker expressed a need for the
college to develope a philosophy corl~
cerning independents and determine
what the independent project re-
represents. “Should it represent,”
Walker asked, “a rather very rig—
orous new real proiect and not a
re-hash of something thaijustdoes-
n’t happen to be offered in the
classroom in that area?" This will
be but one of the many questions
that the Executive Council Subcom-
mittee on Education Policies will
need to consider when it meets to-
day at 4 o’clock to discuss among
other things, independent projects.

when asked if the Open Forumwas
planned because of student response
to independent limitations, Walker
replied that the Forum was planned
before any actions of independents
were taken. If student interest 6on-
Iinues Walker would like to have an
open Forum on a bi-weekly basis.
In addition to Deans Walker and
Hamilton, Chairman of the Faculty
Mr. Kintner, Dean oiStudent Affairs
Mr. Kimbo, College Registrar Mr.
Seller and Director ovaollege Ser-
vices Mr. Pomerenk were present.

day. The election will be held

scored What he called the “dom—
inance and arrogance ot the Pres-
idential establishment", He mains
tained, as did the other speakers,
that Congress Could reassert itself
if it tried. The power of the purses
strings, he pointed out, gave the
legislative branch an absolute check
on the President, should they but
choose to exercise it.

This was really the nub of the for-
um. All of the speakers Said that
Congress could exercise effective
leadership, but only if it was wills
mg to reorganize, Fred Schwengel,
former U. Representativefrothe
Fli‘sI Dislricl, advocated an end to
the seniority system in Congress.
According to Schwengel, the pre»

sent sysIem stifles much talent and
prevents capable young people from
rising according to their merit.

Senator Harold Hughes went even
further. He likened the government
to a mirror: “If you expect lit
tle," infoned the Senator, “you get
little If you demand little, you get
less." Hughes, who wrapped up the
presentations, receivedtwo standing
ovations, and was interrupted re-
peatedly by applause as he spoke.
He agreed with Schwengel, whom he
termed “a close and long-standing
friend", buI Said IhnI even if Con»
