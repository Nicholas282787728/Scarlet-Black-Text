”Renew. Expected More

by Gordon Edelstein

High school productions are usually
quite inconsistant There are often
a few talented people in the cast,
but in order to include as many
people as possible, the directol
has got to put people on stage that
don t belong there.

In large productions, the director
usually has a hard time filling the
cast, let alone ﬁlling it with talented
people. But on the whole, high sch-
ool productions have as many holes
as a piece of swiss cheese.

The college theater’s production
of Broadway Review last week was
painfully reminiscent of those high
school productions. Briefly, Broade
way Review was a series of scenes
and songs from plays thatare repre
sentative of Broadway’s develop-
ment. The production, arranged by
Bruce Halversnn, contained music,
drama. comedy, dance and musical
comedy. Halverson showed some
real creativity, but did not do j‘us»
tice to the excellent set designed
by' Jim Reeder, which could have
been used with greater productivity,

ﬂarietta Martin and Denise lversnn

use

i appreciate llalverson’s dilemma
oi having to cast people in multiple
roles, but that tact, does not make
some oi the pedestrian performan-
ces any more pleasing to watch.

Surprisingly, i found the usually
more difficult non-musical scenes
better than the majority oi the
musical numbers. The two opening
cornball scenes had some good tour
ches by both Halverson and the
actors. Backed well by Cecil Lytle
on the piano, these scense captured
the camp intended lfolind Joe Felds
man especially good in the snidely
whiplashiaii interpretation or Byke
in Under the Gaslight. Little Mary's
ascent in Ten Nights in a Barr—
oom provided a good finish to a
play that was somewhat lacking.
I appreciate the difficulties of do-
ing moral dramas, but the acting
and the directing could have been
tighter.

The golden voice of Mike Darragh
was featured in lndianLave Call, the
Cole Porter medley, Oklahoma and
West Side Story. Darragh certainly
has a beautiful voice, but it lacked
the vital punch and power that Broads

name ity Marty sacns

dance to the tune of "Tea for Two“

in a selection from Broadway Review.

The Iconoclast

 

. t .m. gt, “a“:

way musicals demand. This power
was also lacking in Gary Koch's
voice in both Camelot and Oklahoma.

Barry Huff’s courageous attempt
in the very difficult Emperor Jones
was soldewhat effective. Hut! en-
gaged the audience into the terror
that the Pullman porter Jones was
feeling. Huff has talent, so it would
be nice if we could discern what he
is trying to say, in other words,
he needs to work on diction, Haiver-
son added some fine creative touches
to the O’Neil Script,

Two plays were standouts in the
first act. Adding Machine strongly
reminiscent of lonescoian style was
done sharply and with imagination.
Wating for Lefty contained the best
piece of acting in the entire produc-
tion. Brian Mann was powerful and
sensitive in his portrayal Of Agate.
Mann definitely has talent that should
be developed and cultivated further.

As Stanley kramer would say “on-
wztrd and downward” came the se-
cond act. Bye, Bye Birdie 'thuugh
visually interesting lacked punch
and West Side Story was almost
comical, "Everybody Ought to Have
a Maid” was a good song which
lends itself to some interesting ch-
oreography, but fell flat. A vignette
which worked surprisingly well was
The Crucible as the play showed
some real verisimilitude.

The argument can be made that
because the Broadway Review was
fun it should not he criticized in
the way I have done. Just because
it was fun, doesn't mean that it
was good theater, Going to the
Longhorn is fun for that matter.

There were some good scenes
and some bad ones, but as a cho—
rent whole Broadway Review failed.
This is not to ignore some fine
performances among which was Jo-
anna Churgin whose singing oi “Day
by Day” filled Roberts with a vital-
ity a Broadway musical should have;
and David Gaines light-hearted per-
tormance.

The failure of Broadway Review
was especially disappointing to me
because Reader designed suchagood
set and Halverson showed some real
creativity in segments of the re
view.

Race: A Miscegenttted Issue

by Gregg Daffner

The only way racism will be des»
troyed is by weeding it out at its
roots. Only by rejecting collectiv-
ism radically and categorically and
then accepting and living by individ-
ualism can racism be destroyed. So
long as the belief in collective res-
portsibility, collective Worth, collec-
tive identity exists, so shall racism.

Individualism alone can (and will!)
conquer both oi these evils by two
means: Persuasion and Example,
In a rational discussion racismhas»
n’t a chance because it is fundar
mentally irrational. Since actions
speak louder than words anyonewho
genuinely opposes racism can do
something. Individually one can
judge each man’s worth by his Own
merits and one can place social and
economic embargoes on those who
do practice racism.

Some have argued that this won't
Succeed since The System has Insti-
tutionalized racism. That is, since
Negroes are presently at thebottom
due to racism, then judging on the
basis of merit necessarilydiscrim-
inates against them. Therefore,
these people contend ”special priv—
ileges” should be given to them.
This however is a mistake on two
accounts, First, special privileges
(hiring blacks and women before
white males etc.) necessitates the
ferior quality, (lithe persons grans
ted this privilege are not in fact
less qualified then they don’t need
special privileges , only an even
chance). The presence or under
qualfied workers (i. e teacher, man.
ager, etc.) not only remiorces ale
ready existing racism but fosters
it anew

The second reason why reverse
discrimination is evil is thatotten
it is directed against innocent vice

tims, While there were Justgrounds
ior believing white slave owners
should have paid reparation to their
slaves, to extend that argument
to living whites is absurd. The slave
owners were individually guilty of
a crime, whereas white men today
did not colnlnit those crimesand us-
ually aren’t even related to those
who did. Even it my father were a
racist, that is no Justification for
penalizing my career. For negroes
to hold whites collectively respon»
sible tor racist policies is simply
an act offrustiation, and for whites
to accept such guilt is masochism.
There has been a lot of talk re—
cently about how the government
uses New , Speak (contradictory
language) to ohfucate the issues,
and many think it is an ugly power
plot The tact is, almost everyone
is doing it especially‘the “intell»
ectuttls” and we now face a con-
ceptual dilemma. I Submit its evir
dence the language and intentions
of those who support ”CivilRights”
laws (i. e only those laws which
force private individuals not to dis-
criminate on the basis of color,
creed, etc) llcre we have an odd
paradox indicative oflitleral thought:
If the majority of Americans really
favored these laws and wereopposed
t0 racism then the laws would be
democratic but unnecessary. if the
majority was opposed to racism,
then certainly they would not dis-
criminate :tnd Negroes would not
he dcnied jobs and housing etc,
However ii the majority opposed
these laws and were racists then
not only were the laws antisdemOr
cratic but also anti—liberal. If lie
beraiisnl maintains a belief in “mi—
nority rights". thCn liberals must
remember that the smallest mine
ority on earth is the individual

Thereiore, to he consistent, they
must support the racist’s right to
be racist.

The reason why liberals are inthis
dilemma is precisely because they
are inconsistent. They support”mi»
nority rights” when convenient.
They maintain that racists must
sacrifice their rights on the grounds

Wall Reflects On New Role

by Steve Nunn

Joseph Wall, former dean of the
college and now professor of his-
tory and commencement speaker-
designaled for this year’s senior
class, was recently asked by the
5&8 to reﬂect on the State of the
college, country, or both, and this
is what he said.

Watergate and Vietnam

Wall links the Watergate issue to
the climate of presidential arro-
gance that grew up during the We
tnam war.

”It’s easy to get caught up in the
headlines, of course, but I do the
ink this may turn out to be a
major event, the beginning oi a new
period in our history where the
power ot the presidency will de-
cline and that or Congress will
grow," he said.

“There are similarities to the lat—
er years of the nineteenth century,
when the presidency was played
down after the Reconciliation per-
iod.”

And, he added, this could meandit—
ferent candidates in 1976 than those
who are now considered likely.

An actual resort to presidential
impeachment would be very ser-
ious but is not impossible, Wall
thinks. .

Watergate. complicates an already
bad situation for Republicans in
Iowa, where farmers were already
discontented with the economy and
the questions that surround the wit»
eat sale to the Soviet Union. And,
said Wall, the state is likely to
continue the resultant Democratic
trend that was evident in the ‘72
election,

But, despite “good” student activ-
ity during the ‘72 political year,
Wall predicted a decline in the le-
vel of radical political student ac-
tinn.

This could be because studentsare
“turning away irom what they be
lieve is a dead ende-it could be
moral exhaustion rather than ap-
athy,” he said.

Their withdrawal could mean a re-
emergence in new directions or
could be simply a cyclical swing,
he said,

"At any rate, it's happening all
over, not just at Grinnell. it’s kind
of eerie, how all the campuses are
doing the same thing,”

inaction in the radical area off
campus may well cat ry over to the
college environment, according to
Wall.

There will be, he thinks, a return
to more traditional methods of col-
lege administration, at Grinnell as
well as other colleges and universi—
ties.

As evidence, he cites response
in one of his current classes to a
civil liberaties test.

Wall gives the test each year to
his class in constitutional history.

This year, ask‘ed whetnel‘Z'Yhey
agreed or disagreed with a state-
ment affirming students’ right to
"participate in basic educational,
operational and policy decisions of
the institution" they attended, 63%
of the class said yes

Last year, 87% of the class had
agreed with that statement

Quality oi Education

Wall also said he hoped there
would be more interdisciplinary te-
aching at the college in the future,

“Things like the new humanities
project l’ll be teaching next year
help breakdown the depai-tmentali-
zation of knowledge, ‘and a small
school like this is in a good pos-
than to cross disciplinary lines
like that,” he said.

Wall is joining several other lace

Grades On A Two Way Street

by Jack Doppelt

During the upcoming buffer days
and final period, all students will
be asked to fill out a faculty evale
uation and recognition form. The
results of the questionnaire plus
collected information about each
faculty member will be compiled
and published in the first public
faculty evaluation booklet ever to
appear on campus.

The booklet will be available in
October, suiiiciently in advance oi
preeregistration ior second sem~
ester.

The purpose of the booklet is two-
fold:

1) to guide each student in select-
ing courses,

2) to steer each Student toward
or away trom certain teachers and
advisers who do not correspond
with theI student’s own interests.
The present system of keeping the
results or the taculty evaluation qu»
estionnalres confidential defeats the
purpose oi both these objectives.
Aside irom these primary goals,
the booklet should engender a few
salutory byproducts, such as cone

veying intormation to the teachers
and the administration,

Over the past few years many stu-
dents and iaculty members havebe-
come aware that the College hasof—
ten (inducted its faculty dismissal
poli ies on a distorted premise.

it is often the case that a faculty
member who does not particularly
distinguish him (her) sell in class,
doesn’t attract attention, but does-
n't rock the boat either is retained
here. The assumption unconsciously
acted upon is that the faculty mem-
her is “adequate," in the most
vapid sense at the term.

on the other hand, a faculty mem
her who is “adequate" in class,
but does attract attention for any
number of reasons will be method»
ically scrutinized, and oftentimes
released, Reason for dismissal: Gr-
lnnell is a ”teach or perish” insti-
tution, and this faculty member did
not "excel" at teaching

What the faculty evaluation booklet
will do is convey how the students
evaluate their teachers’ credentials
in the “teach or perish” arena, a

forum in which a collective student
viewpoint is almost exclusively nppr
ropriate

Some questions on the evaluation
lorm have been geared to convey to
fellow students the successes orde-
flciencies in a particular course or
teacher, such as the quality otclass
readings and the teacher’s ability
to clarify readings and lectures
Other questions will inform Stu»
dents at what they should expect
from the course and teacher, such
as quantity or class reading, quans
tity of written work, and importance
placed on attendance. This informa—
tion will give students all opportun-
ity to match their own predilection:
with the requirements at each coul's
se.

The booklet will also include the
teachers' areas of expertise. liISSr
ertation topics, and thelreduciltional
backgrounds in an eiiort to guide
students to the Iliost helpful and
knowledgeanie source in any given
area, information of this Iidtui‘ewlll
