SGA Candidates Address The Issues

by Terry Wolf

Plans of this year's Candidates for SGA
President range from a possible scrape
ping of the RA, program to the abolition
of faculty tenure, SophomoreRod McVeigh
and Juniors Harry Derdel-ian and Scott
Weil related their views in publlc State—
ments and in separate interviews with
the 5513 [hls week,

Both Derdel‘ian and Wei] consider the
reenactment of a credltsfall option as a
top academic priority. The two also agree
that students would have a greater input
into the decisions about hiring and firing
proiessors if students were made mem-
bers of the Executive Council, Derderian
would like to see the abolition of faculty
tenure and he says that “some profs are
just dead weight and should be gotten
rid of.”

McVeigh told the 55:5 thathehasn’t made
up his mind yet on the issue of credit-
fail, but he agrees with Derde ' and Well
on the need for greater flexi ty in ac-
ademics. ”Students should be given the
chance to take their courses any way they
want to,” McVeigh said. The sophomore
candidate also feels that ”work study is
a must." Derderian emphasizes that stu-
dents should publish their own course des-
criptions.

Social problems hold more interest for
McVeigh and he cites as a major source
of these problems the lack of direction
felt by many students. McVeigh isa mem-
ber of the Public Events Committee andhe
ieels that the committee's programs this
year have made a significant contribution
to the social and academic atmosphere,
much more so than those speakers who
attract only small crowds.

Derderian, in a comment apparently dir-
ected at the Public Events Committee
events, noted that ”the practice of sche-
duling a significant number of events in
Roberts Theater should be re—evaluated.
Stud ts pay forthis entertainment in their
acli es tee; they should be entitled to
see every presentation."

and be held accountable tor the spending
of all social funds” is another of Der
derian's social platforms. well too Sees
a need ior publicity oi the social coor»
dinator's actions and he contends that the
function oi social planning should be “the
concern of the entire SGA, not one single
commiteee,”

To make possible a broader social pro-
gram, Well suggests that a “substantial
portion" of the money now paid by SGA
in salaries--$4,980--be funneled backinto
the social budget or into hall funds. In
place oi salaries, SGArpaid oincials mis
ght receive practicum credit.

The RA, and Career Services programs
brought criticism from Weil and Derders
ian. both suggestedthatproiessional couns
selors be hired for the Career Services
Office and Well hlnted that funding for
this change might come from the $36,000
now being spent ior the RA, program,

jority of the votes cast, there will be a

Those unable to vote Monday should

for implementation are not. In general,
the candidates feel that SGA has been
either too busy with its own affairs or
too concerned with issues of no rele—
vance to the campus.

“What types of real things was SGA talk-
ing about this year?" nerderian asked.
“Jurisdication over pinball machines, and
dogs and cats, Pinballs, cats, and dogs
should not be a major concern.”

The committee structure is “uni
workable”, according to Derderian,
and the Joint Board is ”too involved
with thrivia." In his vlew, “most of the
good ideas are killed right now in com-
mlttee and in the Joint Board."

Derderian denied the rumor that, as an
offvcampus representative to the Joint
Board, he has attended Very few meets
ings. Records confirm this, butDerderr
in said that he had left a number of
meetings early because of the irrele-
vance of the issues being discussed

"Nobody wants to go to a meeting that’s
going to be petty, and i don’t either.”
Derdcrian said. “Half of the glrls at
the meetings sit there and knit scarves
,,,’1‘hree fourths of the Students on Cains
pus would say that it’s bullshit and woule
dn’t attend the meetings "

on lts size. McVeigh, Mears Hall Pres-
idem and member of the Joint Board,
told the $113 that he doesn’t see the need
ior cutting any oiiices. in his words,

“hacking away at oiiices is not going
to pull them in line and put them under
control.,.if there is control, the size of
the bureaucracy doesn’t make much difs
ierence and l think the size we have
now is controllable.”

McVeigh sees the President of SGA
as a “liaison man" and he believes
that the Joint Board needs to take back
power from the committees and the SGA
Cabinet. One or the ways it might do this,
he sold, ls to “instruct the President
that ii any issues come up he has to uni
mediately nutlfy all the Joint Board meme
bers."

if elected, McVeigh would try to give
back to the Jomt Board some of the
power the Executive now holds, because
“if it is not given back, it'll be taken
back, or else the whole thing will crum-
ble.”

Although Well does not fursee making
any changes In the physical structure
of SGA, he plans a basic functional shift
for SGA. “If my platform is adopted,”
he remarked, “SGA Wlll ceasetobe meres
1y a representative oi student opinion
to the administration and iaculty; it will
be much more of all advocate of student
rights. For that, you need a unified stu-
dent body that ls not going to waste a lot
oi time quibbllng over power and juris-
diction."

Weil complains that “argument back
and iorth among students prevents us irom
doing constructive things" and he sees
unity as essential to his brand oi politics,
which he describes as “conflictrarlem
ted.” Without unity, students are uns
able to compete eilectively in a system
which, according to Well, is comprised
of five classes: the administralion, the

trustees, the alumni, the iaculty, and the
students,

”We can accomplish everything my pla~
tlorm proposes," Well says, “by umiying
our position, convincing at least two at-
her power classes to support our cause,
and isolating one or two classes which
oppose us,”

Well is critical of the committee system,
as are Derderlan and McVeigh but for
a different reason. He repeated to the
Ska the contention of hls campaign state
ement that “the Administration has co,
opted SGA into dolng the Admlnlstratlon's
buskurk,”

Derderlan also sees the need for con—
{mutation politics; McVeigh does not. Ac-
cording to McVeigh, “The Administration
and faculty are as anxious as we are
to correct this atmosphere. They must
be worked with and not conironted."
Commenting on student power, he re-
marked, “I don’t even understand why
the question would come up, why people
would argue over it. i see it as open
and shut. If you look at it in economic
terms, the students are the employers.
It boggles my mind to think that our wis-
hes wouldn’t be the most important thing
on campus."

McVeigh claims that his experience”far
exceeds” that of the other two candidates
and he adds, “Like it or not, you have
to be ln lt (SGA) to improve it.” Mc-
Veigh is a member of the Student Ser—
vices Committee. the Finance Commlls
tee, the Public Events Committee, and has
in the past served on several other come
mittees.

Derderian is also a member of the Joint
Board but he was reluctant to claim his
nasl experience as qualification. Instead
he noted: “I know a lot of people on Cam-
pus and I feel I can best represent their
interests because I Ltm attuned to their
thinking ll

Weil was Assistant Student Coordinator
ior one quarter last year, but he claims
that his real qualification for the job
IS his experience with Saul Alinsky’s
Community Action Program in Chicago
