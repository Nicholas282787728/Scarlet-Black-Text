Greenburger: Report From Japan

(Ed. note: Grinnell student VII
creeuburger is currently in Japan
on an ACM program, The SdiB asked
her to relate her experiences. The
replyz)

To the Editors:

I can give no rave reports about
being in Tokyo or about the lnter~
national Divison of Waseda Univer-
sity. it has deﬁnitely been one of
the most trying, confusing, diffi—
cult times of my life. There is no
possible way to conceive of the
things that one's mind, body, and
emotions go through during this ex-
perience unless you go through it
yourself.

The program lacks flexibility. It
creates a dilema and leaves you no
way out of ill Tokyo and the Mk—
usaibu (international division) are
O.K. at first. They allow many
foreign (American) students a way
into Japan who ordinarily would not
have considered coming.

Classes are taught in English (exA
cept for Japanese) and Toky'o as a
city provides many conveniences for
the Westerner. So Westerners with
no background of Japan or Japan-
ese can come here and be gradu»
ally “eased” into the culture. But
it doesn't take long, through Classes
and living with a Japanese family,
to pick up a working knowledge oi
Japanese and become iairly famile
iar with the culture and habits of
the people.

There is a lot of time to travel
in the tall, too, so i would say
that after maybe three months most
people begin to ieel tied down by
the program (school mainly). That
institution which opened their eyes
for them then becomes a source
of constraint. It progressively he»
comes a heavier and heavier weight,
holding one back irom moving on to
new things.

As I said, Classes are OK. 7 es-
peclally for one with little or no
background in the culture. A few
are even stimulating. But because of
the physical necessity of coming to
school five days a week (for maybe
only one or two classes a day) and
spending two or 3 hours commuting,
one is prevented from doing other
more meaningful things, and a lot
of little pieces of time here and
there are easily wasted.

To get into specifics and Speak
for myself (though I know many who
ieel exactly the same way), now that
l have a iair background in the lan»
guage I would like to live among

the people, spend much more time
using the language and mastering
it, and also get away from Tokyo.

1 hate Tokyo Sure, there are some
good things about all its resources,
but I can get those in the States.
Its been an excellent experience to
live in a city, to live in the life
oi a commuter, to be able to be—
gin to comprehend the frustrations,
hecticness, and extreme loneliness
of this kind of life. And if you have
to live in a city, Tokyo is extremely
safe and has excellent transporta-
tion systems. But l've had enough,
From the travelling I’ve done, i
know that the rest of Japan is in-
credibly different from Tokyo, Its
beautiful, charming, warm, friendly,
and peaceiul. There are so many
fascinating things out there “trade
itions and arts hundreds and thous-
ands oi years old, and people that
are human and full of a very differ—
ent way at life irom what I’ve ever
known. But all I can get of it is
bits and snatches.

I hate to condemn the program be-
cause l don't know if l would ever
have come if it hadn’t been for it.
It certainly has allowed me more
than a year's worth of “education"
and experiences that have broaden~
ed my life tremendously.

Clemons, Gorrell,
Wynn: Support

To the Editors:

The students here possess great
potential power. The most viable
way to actualize this potential is
through strong leadership in the
Student Government Association. We
feel that Henry James possesses
the perspicacity necessary todeiine
problems and the personal qualities
needed to solve them.

We know that he is the Strongest
candidate. Therefore, we heartily
endorse Henry James for SGA Vice
President.

Grinnell Needs The Cuban Trojan

To the Editors:

We wish to call to the attention
of the Grinnell College community
the most deplorable and inexcus-
able massacre oi that gem of on
niihological achievement, the Cuban
trogan (Priotelus temnurus). These
illustrious avians exemplify the
highest ideals of the American per
son. Now, what are the highest id-
eals in the American person? Mania
fest destiny, a square deal, a great
society, a new frontier, and peace
with honor. The mere factthat some
dastardly denizens have formed a
clandestine collusion to extermin-
ate this innocent inhabitant of the
SAGA sugar bowls eiiectively ill»
ustrates the gross lack of concern
for the bio-system of the world!!!

We vocii'ermusly protest this eco»
logical travesty and the ramiiica-
tions which will reverberate throu»
ghout the echasystem (sic), pervad-
ing even the lawliest aspects of the
natural equilibrium. We demand that

these grave injustices perpetrated
not only against the Cuban trogan
(Priotelus temnurus); but also 3g,
ainst all thriving organisms, be
immediately and permanently race
tlfledll This can only be done by
reinstating the Cuban trugan (Pri~
otelus temnurus) to its rightful and
deserving place in the sugar bowls

Yacknin° Grinnell Needs Attitude Change

To the Editors:

Back in Grinnell alter being away
last semester, I started talking to
people to see what I had missed.
Most of conversations went some»
thing like thi

“How was last semester?”

“Boring."

“What was so boring?"

“Everything. Classes were boring,
teachers were boring, the library
was boring, concerts were boring,
even getting drunk was boring."

“Well, why'd you get drunk then?”

“I was bored."

i don't think the response is as
funny as it might seem, nor does it
mean that my friends are pretty
boring people. On the contrary, i
think the feeling is more pervasive
than even I am aware of.

To be bored, especially nn a small
campus, portends an extremely dan<
gerous situation. A bored mass oi
people becomes lethargic, passive,
and apathetic. it does not initiate
action; it does not react to events
which warrant response. sadder yet,
'people begin not to care.

The editorials in the past issues
oi the sol; provide examples oi the
predicament i am trying to deline,
The January 25th editorial dealt
with the "annoying" student evaluar
tions, and called for a new type
of "all<campus evaluation system
which deals with a qualitative, not
only quantifiable data,” The edi»
torial in the February 2nd SllB dis»
cussed the self-imposed problems,
the insensitivity, and the meaning-
less organlzallnn which will seek
out the real desires and needs of
students and let itself be used by
them when the need arises."

Both these editorials, in trying to

suggest solutions, seem to hit the
nail on the head. Unfortunately, nei—
ther of them is driving the nail into
the right board. It is obvious that
things have to change, but i quese
two the target Of the solutions pre
sented. The problem with the queSr
tionnaires is not some inherently
”annoying” feature; people don’t
fill them out because they don’t rea-
lly care about them. Similarly, the
SGA’S structure does not prevent
it from meaningfully representing
the student body; the SGA cannot
claim to represent the student body
because too many students do not
care whether SGA represents them
or not.

i ant not suggesting that question,
naires and institutions should not be
revised to meet the changing de—
mands oi the College. Eut start pro—
bing deeper. It is essential, l belie
eve, that a change in attitudes oce
curs among members of Grinnell.
Students have to realize that they
are the most important members of
the College, and then be willing to
act as if they cared. it’s not time.
consuming to become Involved In 30-
me aspect of campus life, and it can
even be meaningful. I canndtbelieve
so many exstudent council preslr
dents and valedictorians do not have
the ability to get things accom»
plishcd,

At the same time, a change in
attitude is not the sole responsir
bilily oi the Students. I am rather
tired of the argument which some
faculty members frequently as
pause: “Why should we be excited
about what we’re teaching when Our
students obviously don’t carc?"Stur
dents might not care, but frustration
and boredom do not flaw one way.

When a proiessor is unexcited a-
bout what he is teaching, it is ex—
tremely difficult for a student to
be excited about the course. All
aura of excitement stimulates cure
ioslty, and curiosity is the link to
knowledge, What a professor gives
to his students is not a function
oi how many hours he talks. but
rather, how he communicates.

Neither is the administration im—
mune irom criticism, The adminis-
tration must not merely listen to
the faculty and students; it must
demonstrate a great deal oiconcern
for them. It must not deal merely
with salaries, maintenance, and
stolen furniture; it must actively
cope with the intangible concerns of
the college, such as faculty»student
~admlnistratlon relationships and
campus depression,

A change in attitudes at Grinnell
will not come naturally. To change
Oneself must be an active, conscious
decision, and lt IS a difficult one.
Nor will it be achieved quicklyi
Questionnaires and constitutions can
be written in relatively short order.
To change people takes time.

But such a change is possible, and,
I believe, widely desired, I believe
a sense of pride in Grinnell still
exists among students, iaculty, and
administration This pride can be
resurrected to provide a positive
direction to the College. Once the
direction is established, it will be
easier to break out of the bore
dom syndrome. For just as depres-
sion and boredom are contagious,
SD is enthusiasm. And enthusiasm
may be just the bOOStGl‘inllellneedS,

Oelke. Student ’D'a'rk' Room

To the Editors:

May I take this Opportunity to re~
ply to Mr Jonathan Silvcrman’s
letter in the $518 of Feb. 16. I
have much sympathy ior his point
of view, and have ielt for many
years that our college should not
only oiier a course in general pho-
tography both as an art and as it
technique, but also have a dark
room available to the student body.
This dark room should be Open
only to those who have demonstrae
ted the knowledge to use the la-
cilltics properly, or who are under
instruction.

I will not attempt to argue the
hobby aspects oi photography ver-
sus its aesthetic ortechnical values,
however I do believe that is is an
excellent activity with probably carv
ry over into the post college years.
It does seem that with over a mil»
lion dollars invested in the P.E.
complex a few thousand could be
iound to accomodate the growing
number of students interested in
photography.

On the other hand, i can well un—
derstand the hesitancy oi the ad
derstand the hesitancy of the ad—
ministration to fit up a dark room
open to the student body at large.
Any facility of this kind which is
everyone's responsibility is in the
end no one's responsibility. The
matter of upkeep is the principle
problem.

i speak irom over thirty years
or photographic experience on or
about the campus. This includes
three years of teaching a fourcred—
it Course in photography and ten
years as sponsor of a student cam-
era club which had a sporadic ex-
istence for that period with dark
rooms established in three differ-
ent locations.

artistic potential is in be develop

Mayrent: Special
Vision Needed

To the Editors:

Basically, i agree with Bob Cocks
that perhaps the romance is gone
irom liic at Grinnell. However, hav-
ing recently been a visitor at Drake
University, where people do indeed
observe “those exquisite little dif-
icrences,” l ieel somewhat quali-
fled to assert that such a system
does not lead to romance, but rat~
her to a very strange, very guilty,
and definite disproportionate empe
asis on-enot romance at all, folks,
but plain old sex.

That kind uf situation~-panting in
the parlors, pawing in the park"
is what truly vitiates both romance
and whatever value and meaning
sexuality might have in a relationr
ship.

I agree that there is too much
homogeneity in the way people tree
at each other here, but I think it
has very little to do with women
acting like men (whatever that me—
ans) or men acting like animals,
or with the externals Mr. Cocks
mentioned at the end of his letter.

All of the letters on this subject
exchanged so far have neglected what
many people feel is most imporv
tant: that sexulaity is Something wn,
ich can be found in its best and
most poweriul state only very deep
inside someone, and that very often
It takes special and loving eyes to
see It. perhaps the unhappy and fru-
strated people on this campus need

dltlDl’ls with equipment in good work
ing Order. This means that anydar I
room facility open to the studen
body in general must have a per-
son in charge who is present a
all times that the room is open,
and who is responsible tor its cone
dltion and use

Herein lies the catch. It is not the
first cost, but the upkeep, largely
ior supervision, that is expensive.
An unsupervised darkroom goes
down hill fast both as to equipment
and working conditions. Somebody
works until two or three o’clock
in the morning, ends up dead tired,
and leaves the place in a mess. it’s
human nature, The next person who
tries to do some work finds the
trays left with residues of dried
developer, hypo spots all over the
work bench and floor, and cigarette
butts piled in the corners. Ispeak
irom experiencel

I would support amove toward pro,
vidlng an adequate, well equipped
photographic dark room, with indiv-
idual lockers, for general student
use on the Grinnell campus, but
only under adequate control. it sh~
ould be open only at stated hours
during the day or evening, and have
a trained student or other respon-
sible person present at all times
not only ior supervision, but also
to advise on the use and care of
equipment.
