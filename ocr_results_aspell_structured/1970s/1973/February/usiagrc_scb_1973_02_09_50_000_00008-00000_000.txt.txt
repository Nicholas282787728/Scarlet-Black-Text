Icemen Comeih, lose

by Jeff Dick

Last Friday night, Feb. 2nd, the
Grinnell Hockey Clubtraveledto Des
Moines to play Drake University at
the Des Moines Ice Arena, In the
preliminary game the D. M. Capir
tols lost to a league foe For awhile
Grinnell’s team was wondering if
they were ever going to take the
ice. The referees from the first
game were using our club’s locke
er room and wouldn’t let us in.
While we waited Drake’s team took
the ice and had a lot oftime to warm
up.

Finally our twenty»mztn team
“stormed" the locker room and took
it over. Then when we took the ice
most of us almost collapsed from ex—
haustion after one lap because it
wasn't exactly Barber Plaza. After
we warmed up tor about twominutes
Drake was ready to begin. The oi-
ficial referees never showed up so
a couple of Drake students were
used, Once they found a whistle the
game began.

One of Grinnell’s injured players,
Bill Kaiser, served as the game’s
bench coach as the team’s regular
coach, Mike Levy, is the goalie.
Grinnell had four lines of forwards
and three lines of defense and Bill
moved players on and oil the ice
as everyone got a chance to play

Out of the three periods Gri »
hell’s team played one good perr
iod r the last one in which we
tied them, 2 - Z Grinnell’s de—
iense wasn't so red hot during the
iirst two periods as Drake scored
5 goals in each period. The dual
socre then was 12 . 2. Mike Levy
played remarkably well in the nets
as he turned back 39 shots. Our
team only got 12 shots on their
goal, but we treated every shot
on goal as a goal. We also figured
that if we held them under 15 goals

and if we got any then we’d conside
er it a victory Thereiore, we won,
and everyone had a great time.
Grinnell's goals, were scored by Al
Frey, unassisted, and Jay MaCAfee,
with an assist from Steve Larrick.
Bob Smith played a steady game
deiensively, and several others also
played well, including Larry Bre—
skin, Joe Genereux, Dave Flalen,
John Onstad, and Mike Levy in
goal.

Our club travels to Omaha for
another game on Feb. 113th We
practice three times a week, usually
with a short scrimmage session on
Sunday atternoon around 3:30,

tor GatessLangan and Wes Fujii
and Gary Diers both scored 20 for
the losers. In the last game of the
week, East Norris decimated
Younkers' aluminum foil tour 61—
33. Bob Arnold bucked in 23 for
overinflated East Norris.

In interest group brball the Out
side Bombers semircrushed Skid
Row 6551. The Bombers were paCr
ed by Dave Gitlin’s 20 points. The
vogi Lobers, aided by Karma Greg
Fallon’s 26 points, mesmerized the
Breed 66-30. Chemistry outreach-
ed the Turkey Basters 48-30 and the
Knights Slew the Bulls 93738 as Sir
Bill Bailey dueled his way to 39
points for the Knights.

Simpson Spikes V-Bollers

by Lynn Lichtenberger

In a contest that was tougher than
its score might indicate, Simpson
defeated the women’s volleyball
team 15712, 1572, 15710.

Play in the ﬁrst game was much
improved over last week's loss,
as the team showed the results of
practice. Volleys were sparked by
Setups, and a iew spikes madetheir
appearance. However, Grinnellserr
ving was shaky, and the Simpson
squad reached 15 points first,

The second game was terrible.
Since this was the clutch game,
the tension mounted, and the wom-
en iorgot to function as a team,
This game illustrates the prob-
lems I see with both Grinnell woe
men's teams: nervousness in comps
etition is compounded by mistrust
for each others capabilities The
result is people playing as indiv-
iduals and missing plays that would
have been simple if teamwork had
been utilized.

These problems are understand»
able. First, most Grinnell girls

have never participated in compe-
titive sports. Therefore, they have
never learned to channel their game
tension into constructive nervous-
ness, to use that adrenalin to imr
prove their play, Second, lack of
team sports for women has re
sulted in women not learning to
cooperate and work as a team,
Winning is not important; team
work and trust are,

The third game bears some of
this out. It did not count, so the
pressure was eased. Coach Hoth
had admonished the team for its
distrust, so they weretrying to work
as a unit. The 15-10 loss does not
reveal the good play, but an im-
proved team was seen, Some fine
over-hand serving by Sue Biese,
iahtastic spiking by Mary Jane Elam,
and a timely block by Lynn Lich—
tenberger contributed to the play.

The women’s volleyball team has
the potential to be excellent. Ey
teamwork, utilizing the valuable
tools Ms. Hoth is presenting, and
relaxing, this team could be fine.

Wrestlers
Improved

by Rick Nightingale

Although losing its iirsttwo meets,
the Grinnell wrestling team has
shown notable improvement. Under
the expert coaching of Mike Peter-
sen, the wrestlers are better dril—
led, better conditioned, and stronger
than in recent years.

The Pioneers lost their first meet
to Simpson by a score oi 4072.
Rick Nightingale lost a superior de-
cision at 118 lbs 12-2. Butch Gates
(134), Arnie peters (150), Charlie
Nash (158), and John Straley (190)
were all pinned. John Dougherty
and Jack Couch won by forfeit at
126 and 142 respectively. Simpson
won by forfeit at 167 and 177.

On February 5, Grinnell was de-
looted by Coe 4976. Joe Ferrell de-
cisioned his opponent 10-1 in an ex-
hibition match at 1151bs. Rick Night-
ingale upped his record to 2~l (his
first a pin against Knox) by pinning
his man in 3:39 at 118 lbs to score
Grinnell’s iirst and only points.
John Daugherty was decisidned at
126 by a score of 14—1. Coe claimed
forfeits at 134, 142, 158, 167, and
heavyweight. These five forfeits ac-
counted ior thirty points. Charlie
Nash and Dennis Walters were pin~
ned at 150 and I77 respectively.
John Straley almost decked his op-
ponent, but lost a close struggle
9r6.

The next home meet is Tuesday
night, at 7:30, versus Dubuque. Wr-
estling meets take place in the PE.
Complex.

Aquamen Take 2nd Ai Rockford

by T. R. Key

Grinnell’s turbulent, terrliying, tr-
ussed-up tankers traveled to the
eleventh annual Rockiord Relays
last weekend and brought home secs
0nd place honors

The meet was won by a very pow-
werful Wheatun team. Grinnell fir
nished in second place, in a tie with
host Rockford, Rockford was a co-
winner of the Grinnell Relays here,
so our team did Well to tie with
them, other teams participating
were North Central, IIT, Eureka,
North Eastern lllinois, and George
Williams College.

Grinnell survtved the morning pres
limtnarles in all eight events and
then scored well in the finals, The
lone victory for the Pioneers was
in the individual medley. Lastyezlr’s
winners and recordhnlders,the Nerf
squad (Winters and Rowal), joined
by senior Ron Brnmmer, edged out
tough Wheaten tor iirst place honors.

The turkey squad managed second
place in three oi the events on
Saturday, The medley relay team oi
Winters, Beye, Rowat, and Reed
finished Close behind Wheaten asdid
backstrokers Brdlnmer, Fleckenr
stein, and Winters, The ZOOryd.
ireestyie relay team oiBtesh, Reed,
Waterdog, and Beye swam well to
finish Second.

Grinnell also finished fourth in the
400 fly/breast relay (Scherler, Mar—
tin, Rowat, Beye). fourth in the 400
iree relay (Brammer, Btesn, Wal-
derhaug, Btesh, Fleckenstein, and
derhaug, Reed), and Sixth in the
distance medley (SO—100450400)
with walderhaug, Btesn, Flecken-
stein, and Brown,

1 don't know why I always iorget
the lilypad divers. Maybe because
they usually target to practice. Well,
the divers fought an uphill battle
last weekend, but managed to pull
in a second. Mark Burton, return.
ing to action at Rockford, looks like
he is getting the kinks out of his
noseplugs. Larry Huntoon didn’t
wake up until the afternoon. lstill
don't know who he borrowed his in—
ward 1 1/2 from, but a good dive all
the same.

This week end our fowl friends
fly away (they wish) to meets at
Luther on Friday and St, Olaf on
Saturday, where they’ll battle Coo,
Carlton, and St. Olaf.

This week’s trivia question is: What
turkey squad member has been seen
with what namesake from the old
Andy Griiiitn Show?

NOTlCE: this reporter takes no
credit whatsoever for inﬂuencing
