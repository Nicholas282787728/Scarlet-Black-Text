Elections for the two SGA Vice-
Presidencies will be heldMonday
in the Post Office.
One male and one female vice~
president will be elected. Junior
Pete Rainer is the sole male
candidate, while junior Sybille
Scott will'face freshman Terri
Yasdick for the female position.
VLC. Woods and Mark Hanlsch
withdrew from the race for the
male vicerpresidential position.
All three candidates expressed
general agreement with the Polk
cies set down by SGA President-
elect john Hansen, and a desire
to aid Hansen in accomplishing
the goals he has set down.

ructure. she believes that "al-
though there aren‘t a whole lot
students involved, that's IIOISaY’
ing there can't be." Scott feels
that many people are wary of
politics today, but thinks that,
If SGA is Concerned With stu*
dent problems, “then students
will become interested."
To improve Grinnell social li-
re, Scott “would coordinate all-
campus activities with halls.Th'

ere's definitely a social problem _

on campus, especially for Black
students." Scott would like tosee

‘ more Grinnell activities which

would fit in with Black students'
pre-Grinnell backgrounds. This,
she contends, would ea se soinc oi
the problems faced by Blackstu»
dents in adjusting tacampus life,
especially in entertainment.
"Every month you get this cal-
endar full of things to do and
you find out that most of Lhe th-:

0

ings on the calendar aren't real-
ly things you like to do. Social
life is often confined to what we
can dig up ourselves."

Scott would like ‘SGA to play a
greater role in the formation of
academic policy. “The Educ2r
tional Policies Committee, tome,
does nothing but make the stu—
dents feel that they are a part
of the decision’makmg processr
its a type of pacifier. Lenny
Kurz, who resigned irom the
EPC, saw from the inside that
it just wasn't working the way
it should."

Scott contends that Collective
thinking is vital if thc SGA is
to be a functioning body. ”l_‘d
like to get out there and work.
1 like to think that, when prob-
lems arise, 1 (2m dealwiththem."

Terri Yasdick set-s Opening up
better avenues of communication
as important to improving the
workings of SGA. This wouldalso
invite more students into thegov-
erance process, she feels.

"Solid lines of communication
between the student body and
student government are very im’
portant if the government is to
function efficiently and in 3 IE"
prescntaiive iashion."

Yasdlck feels that Communicat
tion is L‘speclally lacking wtth
underclassmen. As an underel‘
assmon, Yasdick feels that she
could "remedy the situation a
lot by being able to deal on a
closer basis with other under
classmcn who don‘t get informar

Palmer: Out Of ISPIRG To Seek House Seal ,

AMEs, LArrGeorge Palmer exe-
cutive director of the Iowa Stu-
dent Public Interest Research
Group (ISPlRG), will take a th-
ree month leave of absence fr"
om that post to seek the Demi)’
cratic nomination for state rer
presentative from the district
which includes Ames.

Skip Laitner,.envtronmental co-
ordinator for the group,will ser‘
ve as acting executive director
until June.

Concern that College facilities
aren't being used to their full-
est extent was expressedby Yas-
dl'ek. "Money should bealloo’dted
to fix up the rally wagon for its
use by groups not necessarily
affi ated with the Student Recr
reation Association."

Along these lines she added,
“There is a lot of room for op-
ening up and creating newjobs on
mmpus so that there would be
more available jobs for students
both receiving financial aid and
those who need them but are not
necessarily on aid. Positions as
campus operators for job-sock-
ing students should be explored.

Yasdick's major academic cone
cent is a reexamination of the
credit-fail system. "The option
of the credit-iail system men-
tioned by Hansen could be rid of

a lot of needless Dressure for
those students who do not nec*

essarily go on to graduate schr
ool." Yasdick would like to work
independently, presenting alre-
ady formulated ideas to Presi-
dent Hansen for his opinions.
Pole Rélner is concerned with
the secrecy on campus realizr
ing that "a lot of the ,decisions
that are made by the adminiS’
tratlon and ti hell of a let are
made by the executive council
directly concerning students, yet
these matters receive no student
input. A lot of these things can
really affect students, suchas the
decision to remove one position
in the sociology department. The
Executive Council does not relay
its working to the students."
Reiner feels a need for "more
communication for the Students
from the Executive Councilorher
than the presei‘it random system

of announcements. "I endorse
having the SGA President or so-
me other student oifictal sit in on
the Executive Councilmeetings.",

‘If the committee is to serve st—
udents, it is necessarythata stu-
dent be in there watchingand con-
tributing a student's perspective
to the decismn-makingprecess."
Reiner was not sure whether
or net the students should ham:
3 vote on the committee.

To channel more student input
into the S.G.A., “students must
feel that the SGA is doing some-
thing, and the only way to do
that is [0 do something." One
suggestion Rainer makes is that
the S.G.A. could play a very im'
portant role in insuring the Co“.
[inuatlon of the Institutionalized
Grapevine. Reiner also reclsthat
the grading system should change
back (0 include the‘full line of
grades and the Credlt’ﬁail option.

Reiner would like to see a more
positive social atmosphere arr
‘ound Grinncll College. “The SIU’
‘dcnt Adviser program could be
one means to this goal. There
should also be more concerts,
possibly in conlunctton with other
schools. Moreallacampusactivir
ties, like digger-dinners would
be effective, if just for hanging
out and meeting people,"

"The S.G./\.," Rainer remark-
ed, “has enough input. If it could
enact even two or three of the
proposals that came out in the
presidential
kept busy for quite a while. We
must try, first to accomplish th-
ings by workingwithin the frame-
work provided, Without being sub-
servient to the faculty or adminr
iStrat‘ion.”
