B & G strike: the Week in review

by Douglas llalsey

Late Thursday evening oi last
week, a group oi concerned
students. calling themselves
Students for a Just Settlement, met
in Crazy House to again discuss the
issues oi the slrike By their own
admission they i‘iere sympathetic
to the B&G cause yet they were
also seeking some means to bring
about a rapid 0nd to lhe strikc.

They agreed that the main thrust
of any activity should be directed
toward pressuring the ad»
ministration into more positive
action in settling the strike. As
discussion ensued, several
proposals \\ere brought upiand
rejected. it was thought that a
blockage ol college trucks supr
plying Saga iood service might be
an eiiectirc means oi voicing their
concern Yet it was rejected ior
reasons at possible legal reper-
cussions and probably increased
student animosity, especially since
the majority of the students on
campus were on Saga board plans,
rather then gain any signiiicant
student support

Another proposal dealt with the
occupation oi Nollen House, a real
occupationea take over, but again
there were legal repercussions
which could not be ignored,
Eventually, it was agreed that an
“occupation" in such a way as to
make their pressure known and
ielt in the daily activities oi the
great white house, but not in a way
that would in manner impair its
operation would be the most
signiiieant action which could be

taken-essentially: sit in. l'

The next morning, Friday the
13th, aiter each had packed some
personal belongings and bedrolls,
16 students entered the ads
ministration at about i am They
were almost immediately cone
ironted by President Glenn
Leggett, who in no uncertain terms
iniormed them, “You’re in
trouble,” but asked them to meet
with liiinseli and Dean Walker in
the third ilonr conierenee room oi
Nollen House The group was at
that point iiilorined that they laced
suspension and possible expulsion
it they did not leave the building by
3.30 am (in tliclr meeting the
previous night the subject oi
possible suspension had been
brought up. and it was decided that
it would he a ~'sk they would have
to take to bring about the desired
pressure 1

The students appealed lor an
extension oi the time limit in order
to ConSlder the matter and were
granted until noon They were
iniormed that the administration
had just completed a new set oi

come at a Very lnopmtunc time
that ”new set oi proposals" was
the colleges iinal oiter, 25 cents
and 26 cent raises and the addition
oi 1 holiday, granted at the
college's discretion, after the
second year oi service

As the group met, it became
obvious that they were facing iar
graver consequences then they had
realistically imagined. They were
laced with probable immcdiate
suspension oi undetermined
length, a week, a month, a
semester, li they were suspended,
they would not be allowed to reside
in any college-owned housing or
use any college lacilities, and this
would significantly hamper any
iurther actions.

In a more practical sense,
several oi the group were seniors,
and they lelt that the tact oi" 00’
cupying Nclien House was not a
signilicant enough action to
warrent the Consequences of
suspension. it was better to stay
“alive,” they felt, and try to Work

Binding arbitration hasically
imolvcs the Federal mediator

the l\\‘0 sides a list oi 5 names of
per sons who are quoliiied to act
as arbiti-atois. Each side with.
draws the names oi two per.
sons, and the remaining one
becomes the arbitrator.

Another source loi- obtai ng
a list or qualified arbitrators is
the American r\rbitratioii
Assoc. in New Y Whatever
the source, the limil selection

a thorough and detailed study oi
the strike situation, taking into
account problems oi both sides

proposal which he has found to
be the best settlement plan. The
plan must be automatically
