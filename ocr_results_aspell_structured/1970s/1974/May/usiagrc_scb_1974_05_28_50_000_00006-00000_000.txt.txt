Tederman: Four:

by James Tederman

When you plagued Grimell as freshmen,
I was an R.A,, as sophomores an Assis-
tant Dean, as juniors an Associate Dean,,
ans as seniors the Dean of Students. it
seems that I have climbed up the Ladder
with you. I donft know how all of you be-
came seniors, but I became Dean simply
by per-severing. Everyone else in the Stu~
dent Affairs office left each year and, not
knowing what to do with me, the College
promoted me. i hope this isn’t the same
path you have taken to your Bachelor of
Arts degree. _
Four years ago, Jane, Caine and I lived
in Younkers as Resident Advisers. That
year, I can remember seniors lamenting
to me about how straight, conservative,
and serious you were compared to pre—
vious Grinnellians. There was talk of a
conspiracy in the Admission office to get
a "new breed" of student.

In short, many seniors of l971 felt that
Grinnell was drastically changing, that the
freshman board scores were going down,
and that the College would soon collapse.
It is ironic for me to hear many seniors
in the class of '74 saying exactly the same
things about this year's freshmen. Some
things never change.

Still, Grinnell students do act differently
today than they did when I came he re five
years ago. If I were to make a gross gen-
eralization, it would be that Grinnellians
today are futuristic and goal oriented in
their outlook as opposed to the more im-
mediate “here and now" attitude of past
years. Students then were not as pre-
occupied with themselves, grades, grad-
uate school‘s, jobs as they are now, but

rather with Vietnam, Cambodia, Kent St—
ate, the draft, racial violence, student
power, B it; G strikes, demonstrations,
and the closing of the College. These
were burning moral issues that deman~
ded committed personal decisions and im-

mediate action. They were issues that
permeated every aspect of College life.
1 don't really think that people were
different then than they are now. Today’s
freshmen are no better or worse than you
are. They simply are faced with different
circumstances which require different re-
sponses. Inflation and unemployment are
much more subtle issues than war and
peace and they cause us to react in dif-
ferent ways. ,

Many of my nights in 1970 were spent

Spider Rabbit in Capand Gown

by John Schechter

Hi, I’m Spider Rabbit. Goa, it’s nice to
be here. This is a newspaper column.
They made me say that. Personally, I'm
not sure. The only other time Ihave been
in the newspaper was the time I got cau-
ght walking out of the A and P with eight-
een pounds of fresh mushrooms under my
coal.

with time off for good behavior, I made
it out here in time for New Student Days.
Which brings me to my topic.

When we were freshmen, I’m sure my com-
peers remember, Grinnell College was a
different place. I mean it was in a different
place, They moved it the summer after our
sophomore year.RememherWomen’s Gym?
They lost it.

Don’t rub it in; B and G is Still pretty

, embarrassed about it.

The new site of the college is on a plot
formerly occupied by an independent Gr-
eek city-state. The Romans destroyed it,
and then the barbarians destroyedthem, and
then the English made it a colony. We

bought it from the English for $24.89 plus ,

tax. The tacks were easy to find; the
Romans plowed them into the ground along
with the salt. The English are still laugh-
ing. So this college has a lot of history and
stuff behind it. Cheer up, we could be in
Utah,

Coming to Grinnell right after reform
school was quite a shock. (I would have
said Culture Shock, but it’s hard. to type
wearing finger cymbals. I‘m 0.K., you’re
0.K. Chingl Krishna. Actually, I'm just
awful, thanks. How are you?). It wasn't
all that much of a shock, becauseourS.A.'s
had some of the good old games for us,

just like when we used to be the 67th and
Locust Kakodaimonistai. That's Greek for
Bad Boys.

See, I did learn something. Anyway, what
with the old Read Hall Knife-Throwing
Contest and stealing Earl Creoelius’s tow-
el while he was in the shower so he would
shock some guy’s girlfriend, we had a good _
time. We would have had fun anyway, but
we were all learning to work within the

system, so they had it all planned for us.

Read Hall even had a “mixer” with the
girls in Mears. There were rumors about
what was going on-over in the Norrises,
but they were probably just rumors. They
made me say that, too. Hi, l’mSpider Rab-
bit

But now, after four glorious years of fun
and frivolity and SAGA Ranchero-radish
Delite, we have to leave. And breaking up
is hard to do, do wah diddy. Some ofus
have not had enough yet and are going to
grad school. Some are going to medical
school. . .

Forty grand a year by the time they're
thirty—five. Not bad, guys. And most of
us, the great class ofSeventy-Four,areen-
terrng the real world of work.

Plastics, Benjamin.

Sadder Budweiser, we all have to grow
up. Sniff. This wiiter leaves behind his
happy undergraduate years with a lot of
memories, a few regrets, and the hope
that he makes it back to Jersey with the
damned U-l-laul on the tail of the car.

Is this long enough, Jack?

In closing, let the old Spider Rabbit add
his best wishes for the future to all of you
who are' leaving. Go get yours, clowns.

Two years from now I should be on my
way to grad school, a job or possibly the
happy home. With the way events have been
shaping up this is how an interview to grad
school would be in 1974.

"Have a seat. My name is Juan Sofer.
I'm the admissions counselor here at Law-
bords University. According to my re-
cords you are Darryl Echt from Grinnell
College?"

“Yes, sir, it’s a small, liberal arts coll-
ege in the midw . . ."

“I‘ve heard of Grinnell, It’s the school
that sponsored a naked Playboy bunny
convention a few years ago, wasn’t it?"
Mr. Sofer interrupted.

"Well, not exactly. It is a well-respected
school. Darryl explained trying to cover up
the incident. "Let’s get down to brass
tacks and Ihope we don't get stuck. That's
just a little incisive wit I like to add to
make you feel welcome," Sofer interjec-
ted tacklessly. "It seems that we are mis-
sing recommendations from all yourfresh-
man, sophomore and junior-year profess-
ors."

“I couldn’t avoid the omission. During my
sophomore year, two of my politicalscience
profs resigned along with one of my histo ry,
sociology, and educationprofessors.So they
couldn’t very well write a recommendation
wgen they weren’t there,” Darryl explain-
e . ,

Year Bedfellows

talking people down from bad trips (once
there were eight people humming out in
one evening). I can’t truthfully say that I
miss that, yet once in awhile when Potts
and crew have a party on North Campus,
or when John takes a sudden dislike to
the Saga menu, I have a lingering wish that
(to parody the quote of a well known
campus figure) “acid was»back and back
big." ,

I have also spent countless hours with
some of the inconspicuous members of
the class of ‘74, such as Scott Weil, Ellen
Yacknln, Joe Genereux and Bob Ruhl. It
is always a joy to know students like
these four, who never cause any prob-
lems or have any great impact upon Grim,
hell but instead silently pass through four
years known only by a few professors who
have them In class.

Until a few weeks ago, I was under the
mistaken notion that John Wylie was a
member of the class of '74. Upon finding
out that he was not, I immediately peti—
tioned the Committee on Academic Stand-
ing to give him senior status. The com-
mittee, however, took an unusually hard
line and refused my request that John be
granted 32 practicum credits in journal-'
ism and be allowed to graduate this spring.
I am now considering an appeal of this
decision to President Leggett.

I can also remember some of the sen-
iors of "II thinking that Harry Derderlan
was the wave ‘of the future and that the
world (and Grinnell with it) was going to
degenerate into barbarlsm and a pile of
broken beer bottles. But "never give a
damn" Harry has somehow‘ maintained
an excellent GPA, is going on to a very
respectable med school and will probably
be a future president of AMA. Thin s are
not always what they appear to be. Right,
Harry?).

So my parting words to you as seniors
are, yes, Grinnell will change -- just as
some of you have changed since coming
to Grinnell, and just as the world chang-
es. There is, however, no conspiracy in:
the Admissions office to get a “newbreed”
of academic grinds ad freshmen, and the
freshmen are not nearly as diﬁerent from
you as you might wish to think.

“That explains those. What about your
physics, communications and philosophy
courses?" Mr. Safer inquired. ,
Trying to retain his confidence, Darryl
continued, "My physics prof retired. So
did my communications prof, and the phil-
osophy professor had a dispute with his
(Iletpartnient and decided to leave a year
8.9L

”Why did you take only one semester of
math and one of German? Did you lose
interest?” the counselor drilled.

“No, you could say the college lost re-
quirements. I would have continued in
those disciplines, but there were just so
many other courses in a limited four-year
period," Darryl answered convincingly.

Your first two years, you received four,
C’s. Can you explain that barely passing
tirade?"

visibly perplexed. Darryl responded that
he saw nothing wrong,wlth a 2.0 and never
considered it “barely passing."

. “It says' at the 00p of your transcript
that a C is the lowest grade above fail-
ing," Sofer said as he pointed to the tr—
anscript.

Darryl with his eyes transfixed on ”1.13.

145" tried to interpret why a C in his
first two years was not at all similar
to the C in his senior year, which, by the
way, he would have taken credit-fail if
there were still such an entity. Thor-
oughly confused, he attempted to explain
that his advisor would have elucidated had
he not been on sabbatical during Darryl’s
senior year.

Sufficiently confused. Juan Sofer decided
to level with the Grinnell grad.
“Why should Lawbord U. accept you over

a competing student from another school
if your exams are the same?"

Grinnell is a prestigious liberal arts sc-
hool that allowed me to reap the benefits
of the professors on a more one-to-one
basis than larger schools.” ‘

"One-on-one is an idealistic goal but
Grfnnell has a student ratio of about 20-
1 now, doesn’t it?" the counselor queried.

“Yes, but the students are ofthe quality
that spurs intellectual discussion," Dar-
ryl Echt reason-ed. ,

“I’ve heard that Grinnell has abolished
minimal SAT requirements. Has that af-
fected the standards at Grinnell’?“

"What it has done is allowed all types
of people to attend Grinuell. We don’t have
a homogeneous elite anymore. We’ve re»
placed it with a much broader base."

“That‘scomforting to hear. From look-

ing over the lists of applicants we get
from Grinnell College, you'd think the
school was located either in New York
or Chicago," Soler said lightly.

"You see, that is one of the problems
that we are slowly solving. We are in a tr-
ansition period now. The grading system ’-
is complex and confusing because Grinnell
is moving toward the total elimination
of letter grades. We had to increase the
student faculty ratio to keep the school
out of the red and we eliminated SAT's
to lie-emphasize such smid forms of eva-
luatlon. And the exodus of professors just
demonstrates their quality because they
are continually striving to better them—
selves."

“Those are impressive goals. It is dis-
appointing that grad schools such as this
are lagging so far behind and still con-
sider grade point averages and present
statistics of each person’s undergraduate
school. It has been enlightening talking to
you," .Iuan Sofer complimented.

As Darryl Echt walked out of the office,
the admissions counselor asked if he would

call the student from Iowa State into the
office.
