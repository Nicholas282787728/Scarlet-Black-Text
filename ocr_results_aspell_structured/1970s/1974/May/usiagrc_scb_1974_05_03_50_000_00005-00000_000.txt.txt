on Radical Philosophy

ested in his pl‘lilosoplw and method
and their applicability to education
in the United States.

For marry years now educational
thinkers in the United States have

been speaking about our educational ,

institutions as rents of social con»
trol “used as aninstrumentto deoc-
trinate the younger generation...into
the values, presuppositions, and
logic of the given culture." Although
people are socialized or “induce
trinated” by more than educational
institutioris, the educational insti—
tutions of the United States have
railed in their great democratic
function (oi permitting all people
to deal critically with their world,
so that domination by and rorma—
tion or a perpetual elite would be»
come impossible).

Dehumallization

Paulo Freire writes about the de—
humanization in Latin America re—
sulting trom economic conditions,
from indoctrination, rrom treating
men and women as objects in social
institutions and relorm movements.
His educatiotsl methods are at—
tempts to overcome this indoctrin.
ation, to restore man’s role in the
histor1cal process as ana‘ctive,cri-
tical entity.

He argues that educators cannot
indoctrinate msn tor rreedom but
must dialogue with their students
on pro'olumo which concern both
students and educators. There is,
then, no real teacher, but an organs
izer; all are active in the learning
process, a process which involves
not only thought but action as well.

Reviews Montgomery and Cobham

by Bruce Green

It never rains, but it pours, l.rl
the last two weeks, just when I
only have two more columns to
write before the end of the year,
l get about ﬁfteendecords from
various sources including Elektra
and Atlantic. So the next two edi-
tions of my column will each in-
clude reviews of two albums, at
least. This week I will review the
two Latest releases by Melba Mon~
tgnmery, a very good country music
vocalist, and jazz-rock drummer
Billy Cobham.

the '
HE Ill

speaks out

Cabham’s new album, Crosswihds,
(Atlantic SD 7300) is fantastic. A
suite called “Spanish Moss~A So-
und Portrait, " consists of {our com-
positions by Cobham: “Spanish Mo-
SS,” “Savannah the Serene," “St-
orm.” and “Flash Flood."“storm"
is a great drum solo composition,
Cobham playing against the back-
ground sounds of waves and winds.
Cobham is one of the best drum—
mers in modern jazz-rock, certain-
ly the fastest pair of hands in the
business. He creates rhythms and
cross-rhythms with the routine ease
of Hank Aaron hitting a homer. He
also writes very good music, with
complicated rhythmic structures,
such as “Spanish Moss,” where the
meter seems to be nine beats to the
bar.

The backup musicians on the al-

burn and also good: Randy Brecker
on trumpet, Garnett Brown ontrom—
bone, Michael Breaker on Woodwi-
nds, John Abercombie on guitars,
George Duke, keyboards. Lee Pas-
tom on Latin percussion, and John
Williams on bass.

All of Cobham’s records are ex-
cellent, from the ones recordedwith
Miles Davis, andthe Mahavlshnu 0r-
chestra, to the latest. His other
compositions which appear on this
album are ”the Pleasant Phea-
sant,” “Heather," and "Cross-
wind.” They are all performed well.
and the whole album is good.

Melba Montgomery’s latest album,
“No Charge" (EKS 7507s) is plea-
sant country-western vocals andba—
ckground. The lyrics are notinspir-
ing, but the whole album is well-
produoed, well executed, and profe-
ssionally recorded.

The title tune on the album is a
teareierker about a mother whose,
son confronts her with a bill for
his chores, whereupon she pres-
ents a bill for her love and mothers
hood-"no charge, hence the title.
It lacks depth or wisdom, but is si~
mple and pleasant, like the whole
album.

Country music is pleasant to Lis-
ten to, and l have been listening
to it for many years, as my fat-
her is an addict of good country
music. Miss Montgomery is not
great, in the sense that Johnny
Cash, Hank Williams, or Roy Cl-
ark are great, but she is good en-
ough to be considered listening ma-
terial. Unless you are a hardcore
Country Music freak, you won’t en-
joy it at all but for those of you
that are. it is good. See you at
the Relays,
