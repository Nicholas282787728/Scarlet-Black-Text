STUDENTS LEAVING GRINNELL

Explain Departure Reasons

by Abbi Swanson

Actual facts and figures will be
forthcoming from the Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Office, but it appears
that there is an increase in student
transfers and dropouts this year.

A trend toward transi'rring seems
especially prevalent. Janet Devin, a
{re shpe rson from New Je rsey, is di-
ssatsified with the ‘traditional’ ed-
ucation she has received atGrinnell.
Janet remarked, ”experimentation
is uncommon here, and academic
credit is rarely given to students
for outside, related work experi-
ences." .

Disillusioned

Louise Dix, a student from Litt-
leton, Colorado, is also very dis-
illusioned by the academic facets of
the ‘GrinnellEiqzerience.’ “Grinnell
College is becoming too natural sc-
ience oriented, to the detriment of
students whose interests Lie in the
social sciences." Her interest is
in the field of communications, and

Dix feels that she would be
academically stiﬂed and unchallen-
ged here at Grinnell.

Michael Chessler, a sophomore
from New York City, may take a
leave of absence in order to join
the lsraeli army, Unlike manytran-
slerring Grinnellians, Mike is not
unhappy Willi his educational expe r-
ienoes at Grinnell, and would return
to the college. Another sophomore,
Bruce Silverman from skokie, 111.,
may leave to work on a kibbutz in
Israel.

Closer to Home

Emily Moos, a treshpe rson from
Highland Park, 111., is probably tr-
ansfe rring to the University of Chi»
cage, for the purpose ofbeing closer
to home for a semester.

A sophomore transfer from Pres-
cott, in Arizona, may not return in
the spring of ‘75, because he feels
that the potential, academic and ot-
herwise, is not up topar atGrinnell.
“Located in the middle of Iowa,
Grinnell’s extracurricqu activi~
ties are limited. in addition, too '
tle emphasis is placed on inte rdis-
ciplinary studies here.”

informal Process

Information for this article was
obtained through an informal inter-
view process, and in so doing, this
reporter ran across only on instan»
ce (though assuredly there are more)
of a student dropping outofGrinnell.
A freshman from Haines Hall, an

nell for personal reasons, and a st-
rong belief that this college was not
meeting his desires.

This is the last Fatman column oi

review an album, or discuss jazz

Tonight, in Herrick Chapel, at

plays the lute) Will present a fat:-
ulty recital. He will be assisted by
Aaron Mastroski on guitar, and
will perform works by Attaignant,
and Heimr Villa—Lobos, among ot—
hers.

As this is the last column I Will
be doing this year, I would like to
thank a few people without whose
help, none of this would have been
possible. Steve Hirtle and Carlson
Smith, who waited patiently for re-
view records, and did exactlythe
right thing at the right time. The
Staff of the Scarlet and Black who
put up with my inexperience andlack

or typing ability far more than was
required. even of a saint. Anna
Ramsey, without whose help the
Campus Music News sectitm wou-
ld have died a long death. And
last, but certainly not least, John
Wylie, without whose guidance in
times of stress, and shoulder, in
times of pain, I would never have
made it through the semester inane
piece.

Finally, thanks to all of you out
there who read and enjoyed my col-
umn this semester. Have a great
summer, and
