All Stars see stats, 0-38

by Dave Calvert

In the early sixites the New York
Yankees, then in their heyday, had
a couple or longball hitters they
used to call the M&M boys: Mantle
and Maris. And they weren't bad at
what they did.

Grinnell has apparently come up
with its own M&M duo on the
championship faculty football
team, and they do almost as well as
Martinek and Mitchell,

Following the taculty and
staffers’s pasting oi Langan-Smith
who were regular season in-
tramural champions, Chris
Sodoma'orgaized a student “all

brass. The prols eagerly accepted
and the teams mobilized Sunday,
Nov. 17, at south field for the much
anticipated showdown.

The game had hardly begun
when the M&M boys made their
presence felt. Alter a short prol
drive, Martinek found Mitchell ln
the end zone tor a iive yard touch-

game.

Later in the first half, “fleet
footed” football coach Maurice
Hunt, on deiense, trapped “highr
hurdling” Dan Hott, on offense, in
the All Star and zone for two points
and a 10-0 half time edge.

The second stanza saw more
woes for the All Stars, as “little M"

breaking the back of the student
representatives. The All Stars
watched helplessly from here on
in, as the prots ran up the score to a
devastating zero.

in the two games the mats have
played this year, they have out-
scored the opposition 73-6.

Included on the Winning team, in
addltion to the MEiM klds, were
