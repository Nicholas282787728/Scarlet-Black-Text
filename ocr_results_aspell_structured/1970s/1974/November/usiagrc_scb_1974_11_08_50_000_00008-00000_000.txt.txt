CEDAR FALLS, IA—Three
members of the Gi'innell field
hockey sqad were selected for the
All-Iowa team during the Iowa
College Selection Tournament held
here Saturday.

Mary Jane Elam, a senior
playing her last games for Grin-
neil, will fill the right inner positron
on the “A" team. Marnie Zabel and
Lenore Miller, also seniors, will

coach. iiiidi‘a llolh. lining selected

Elam was the leading scorer for
the Pioneers in regular season
action with six goals. She was
responsible for Grinnell's only
score aginst Luther in the afr
ternoon. when the Pioneers went
down 3-1. Luther fielded a very
strong team that got around
Grinnell with very clean stick-
work

The real excitement was in the

Graceland for a rematch of its
earlier severe loss Grinnell took
the ball from the opening bully and

player was heard to remark, "This
can't be the same team we played
before!” _

The only score of the game came
for Graceland on a quick play at
the start of the second half Elam
put in a shot for the Pioneers late in
the second half only to discover a
whistle had been blown to stop
play.

The game was indicative of the
improvement Grinnell has made
since the beginning of the season.
The squad won its last two regular
season games, the final win taking
place on Halloween in Iowa City. A
strong offense overwhelmed the
Hawkeyes by a score of ago. Ellen
Gradv got the first score, \yhile
Elam netted the final two,

Grinnell finished with a regular
season record of 2-4-3

quarterback for Chicago. Time and

again a tough Pioneer defense
forced his passes to go incomplete.
Midway in the fourth quarter he
did complete a touchdown pass,
and after a missed conversion,
Griniicll led 3576.

For Gi‘innell it was their Second

A tremendous effort by the

fcnsive play to defeat Chicago, in
its second year of intercollegiate
play after many ars of club
football, 'l‘omnrro Gi'liinell can
bring its record to a and ti. below
what many team members had
hoped for at the beginning of the
season. but better than has been
seen here in several years.

MT. VERNON, IA—The dream
ended Saturday when Grinnell's
soccer team tell before a strong
and extremely psyched Cornell
squad 2-0 here. The loss broke a
five game win streak for the
Pioneers extending back to Sep-
tember 21 and dropped their record
to a still respectable 5-2.

The question is. could the varsity
football team have beaten the
faculty and staff intramural
football team Sunday afternoon at
North lM field? And the hypothesis
is not all that ridiculous.

0f the ten faculty and staffers
out on the field to challenge IM
champion LanganSmith, fully five
served with distrinction on their
college football teams. Take Mo
Hunt, out of University of Ken
lucky, who was drafted by the
Kansas City Chiefs in the fifteenth
round, 0r Ron Mitchell, a 240-
pounder who picked up four letters
per year at Kentucky, including
service as a captain on the football
squad

Then there were Tom Latimer,
who played ball for University of
Missouri. and Dick Van Scotter, an
allsconference end while at Beloit.

And'tl’lc brains behind the outfit
came in the form of John Martinek.
all-conference quarterback from
University of Wisconsin at
WhitewaterMartinek. stepping in
for his first time with the team,
came up with ten basic plays and a
potent game strategy: pass, pass,
pass.

Never much doubt

Surc.enough, unfortunately for
L'anganSmith‘. the Profs came out
throwing and ran up a bit right at

the outset. Scoring on their first
three possessions, the Profs soon
led 21-0. The touchdowns were
logged by Pete Smith and Hunt,
both on Martinek tosses, and
Latlmer on a 5»yard ramble,

After the half the faculty and
staffers moved right back into the
scoring column, running up the
score on a pair ofscrecn passes. 0n
the first, Martinek found Van
Scotter open on the flat and 30
yards later the Beloit grad. was
alone in the end zone. The lst Profs’
TD saw Latimer amble 10 yards,
for Martinek‘s fourth TD pass of
the afternoon.

The hig“E"

Langan-Smith comeback with a
late tally when running back Ed
Taylor dashed 35 yards through
soaking wet grass for the touch-
down. By then, though, the vaunted
L-s offense, masterminded by QB
Craig Zippe, had been effectively
stifled. It ended 35-6.

For the Profs. it was a long
overdue win, coming as it did after
a summer and fall of informal
practicing and psyching, it also
relieved somewhat the sting of last
year’s losing teams in iM
basketball, volleyball, and softball,

its for L»S, mybe if they hadn’t
been thinking so hard about those
paper-s waiting for them after the
game,: i. , . , - ,

Urinnell beat Cornell in a home
game earlier this year so. Six of
Cornell’s eight encounters involved
shutouts. as the Rams Shut out
their opposition five times,

...iiut no cigar

Given the wet field and
numerous injuries hampering the
Pioneers, Cornell outplayed
Grinnell through most of the game.
While the Scarlet and Black
mounted numerous strong attacks
and had the normal quota of oh so
near misses, the Rams made life
miserable for goalie Gary
Frumkin, who was forced to make
Save alter save.

Several arguments marred the
second half, especially after
Cornell's second goal, which was
“debatable, to say the least."
according to one Grinnell fullback.

Coach John Pfitsch already has
one eyeon next year, and with good
reason. Although six varsity lets
termen are up for graduation, a
deep squad seems set for next year
even before next year's freshmen
show up.

Graduating this year are cap-
tians Dave Calvert, Mark Hanisch,
and Sandy Rikoon, as well as
forward Lester Use and halfbacks
Phil Foster and John Hinde.

Returning starters include
forwards Peter Shearer and Dave
Wynberg; halfback: Wade Lee and
Ron Spritzer; fullbacks Roy
Eichengreen, Denny Minami, and

Several reserves seem headed
for much more playing time, in
cluding Mark Bailey, Sherman

Mark Krause, and John Lom. And
