Q by Betsy Gilman

The American Civilization sequ-
ence, l and U, is one of the 'most
popular courses at Grinnell; 10%
0f the students enroll in it each
semester. Yet until this year wo-
men have been conspicuously ab-
sent from the reading list, although
the contributions they have made
to society and the problems they
have faced have sometimes been
discussed in individual sections.
This year a iew essays by women
have been read each semester.

But that was all,
so this semester WERgﬂDNﬂﬂ
a group of women ,
has spent many @EMPEMWE
hours research—
ing ”other works by women--novels,
poetry, letners, essays, and so on

which could possibly be included
in the Am Civ reading list for next
year. The impetus came from Peg»

gy Shinnel', who dropped the collrse

in February when she realized that

no major works by women were in—

cluded in the bibliography.
Evaluation

Starting in March, she and [our
other women began to collect the
names of books which might be
usetul for the Am Civ readings,
with the encouragement of depart-
ment chairman Charles Cleaver.
They accumulated well over two
hundred titles to begin with, mai»
nly from booklists used by Ameri-
can Studies departments at other
colleges and universities, but even-
tually narrowed this down to a list
of about fifty.

“One tllingl’ve learned,” commen-
ted Katy Janney, a member oi the
group, “is how little I know about
women writers." Anotherlact which
struck all of tllose working on the
project was the irequency with which

Civ Bookllst to Include Women

women novelists write about their
protagonists committing suicide or
going insane, and in tact how ollen
tllls happens to the authors them-
selves.

On April 2,] the students met with
the iaculty in the department and
presented theirwork. The profes-
sors heard the reasoning behind
most of the choices that had been
made. in fact behind the whole pro-
ject, and discussed the books they
thought would be st fit into the course.
in order to maintain some degree of
continuity in the book list, so that
majors who took the classes two
years ago would not be ata disadc
vanmge with those who take it next
year, the department has a policy of
changing only three or [our books a
semester. But they indicated that
more works by women would almost
certainly be included. A Iinaldecis-
ion should be made this week.

'Al 8; Ricks’ Up for Grabs

Many options exist for next year’s
operation of Al KL Rick’s, and the
owners, Seniors Al Frey and Rick
Jelinek, presently are considering
alternatives for the late at their
newly established sandwich shop.
Although they own a year license
for the operation, legal ramillca—
tions of this one future ownership
are unclear.

Having Saga Food Service take
charge at supply and planning tor
the enterprise is one possibility.
Though students would still man—
age the shop, saga would handle
tlle time—consuming tasks involv-
ed in ordering and bookkeeping.
With Saga’s help, Al KL Rick’s could
be expanded to a seven-day week
and possibly obtain discount prices
on supplies.

SGA also voicedplansforthe Iutune
of the sandwich shop. Vice-presi-
dent Terry Yasdick would like to

convert Al Kl Rick‘s to afull-time
delicatessen. It was recommended
at lzlst week’s meeting of the Joint
Boards that this proposal be con—
sidered a goal for SGA during the
upcoming year.

Other students are interested in
assuming command from the two
owners, However, Al warns them
that ”u students run it. they’ll
have to deal with all the planning
which takes a lot more time than
students have.”

Competition for the rights to Al
Ki Rick’s has heightened as the
year draws to a close. A1 laments
the actions by various groups to
“go over our heads on the matter.
we’re very interested in the fate
of our business and anyone who
would like to continue the opera-
lion 0! A1 and Rick’s should at
least consult us first.“
