Cracking the halls
° of ’higher' publishing

by Mike Chessler
nook Editor

At the outset of every semester,
when I'm standing in the bookstore
purchasing my new books, I
usually wonder who wrote this
book and who published it? As it
would be quite difficult to seek out
each and every author of a select

'niumber of possible course books, I

' decided to find out the answer to
the latter question, since in
arranging for reviewers copies of
new publications (notice the new
weekly book reviews) I had to vi 't
a number at publishing houses.

Here follows, in abridged form,
the travails of a new book editor
attempting to procure reviewers
copies of current and forthcoming
books from the major houses, with
definite, preconceived notions.

.while in New York for a week.
TIIEPIIELIMINARIES

Before I begin, I should like to set
up the preliminaries. In every case
I asked the person at the front
desk, or in the office I was reierred
to, the following question: “I would
like to know how I can arrange to
be put on thelist tor the mailings of
reviewers’ copies?” This
followed, of course, a proper in-
troduction.

The morning I attempted this
yenture was clear and warm, an
exceptionally unseasonai day It is
quite possible, too, that there was a
full moon that night

My iirst stop was the venerable
Oxford University Press. Oxford is
one of those places that you know is
going to he impressive, even before
you get there It would not dare be
any other way. You make sure you
walk softly, stand up straight and
speak only when spoken to. In fact.
when I was standingin the elevator
waiting to arrive at the right floor,

Much to my dismay, I got stuck
in the elevator. Oxford was on the
Izth floor. Everyone else in the car
had gotten out on the 10th floor
And somewhere between the llth
and min floors, the elevator tailed
to move. It Just stood there, or
whatever elevators do when
they're doing nothing.

I waited for about a minute

It didn’t work, Then came the
moment of choice, Should I or

So I pressed thelarge red button on
the bottom of the panel marked
“Emergency.” And suddenly some
divine power began to pull me and
my suspended friend (now enemy)
to our appointed floor.
"'1‘ GOT ME‘

Appropriately Ilustered, I
proceeded to the reception room at
Oxford I asked the receptionist, a
stately woman in her late fifties,
with reading glasses suspended on
a pearl chain around her neck, the
question I presented at the
beginning of the article. To which
she replied in a tinely turned New
York drawl, “Ya got me.”

After another minute or two of
discussion and clarification, she
deemed it appropriate to call the
publicity department and see if
theyknewwhatwasgoingon Well,
they didn't. They told the recep.
tionist to call another department,
the name of which I could not
immediately ascertain It later
turned out to be promotion. Why
promotion and publicity were two
separate departments is beyond
my meagre wisdom and probably
an intricate part of the Eriioiis'
scheme not only to win the
American book market, butalso to
uttterly confound and dismember-
it

too early for any sclf respecting

left my name and address, told
them they would be hearing from
me and waited by the exit to try my
luck with the elevator again.

Here I met up with no difficulties
or amusements, so I'll proceed to
the more interesting third stop:

It becomes immediately ap-

plus edition, in nearly 40 volumes,

perhaps more important, they are

'EAIILY PUBLISHING UGLY‘

Arno, like most of the medium
sized publishers I Visited, had a
suite of rooms in a fairly modern
office building on Madison Ave. In
order to get into the inner sanctum,
where publicity takes place, I had
to deal with another receptionist. It
was a surprise at tirst, for not only
was this one in total control of the
situation. she knew exactly who to
call to find out about my request.
She told me that a gentleman
would come out in a moment to

out that most of their books don't
even come with them

PMSLEYMAN

A short while later. a man
dressed in a \‘cry bright paisley
pantsuit emerged from a door
behind the receptionist’s desk and
asked me to come ill. He shook lily
hand with his left hand and with his

he lead me in.

The quarters were so close and
cramped. that I thought he was
going to ask me to sit on his lap,
Amazingly though, there appeared
a chair from undcl' his almost

pleased to be asked to sit. A brief,
though detailed account of Arno
followed with the ultimate goal
being the rejection of my request

Noam Chomsky

 

By Michael Cllcsslcl'
hook Editor

The first question one may ask
about this book is- is the title a
Joke? With the current state of
world affairs and especially there
in the Mideast the prospects for
peacewr any sort of settlement7
Seem to be quite dim.
Solutions

The solutions to this situation7
that is the whole of the Arahrlsraeli
conflictiand the immediate
forebodings of war are difficult
and exceedingly complex, to say
the least The introduction oi sane
thought into the arena of emotions
is crucial Even though there has
been no dirth of this discussion, it is
still quite necessary to infuse
sensibility and intellegence into the
issue to divert all of us (Arab,
Israeli, etc.) from the blinders of
extremism and conservative
passion. Cllomsky’s book, Peace in
the Middle East? attempts to make
such a contribution.

The bulk of Cllolnsky's writing in
this hook is not new In fact, only
the extensive introduction and the
final essay were written ex.
clusively for this volume The
remaining essays (four of theml
are collected from his y iiigs and
lectures over the past five years,
The third essay is essentially
irrelevant in light of the current
situation, yet It lends interesting
insight into Chomsky's thought
during the years of the “war of
allritlon 1196743).”

Socialist Binationalisln

Save the third essay (see,
above), the remainder of the book
centers around the theme of
socialist binatioiialisin, Chomsky’s
consistent position tor many years.
IIis well documented essays iustify
his reasoning, and leave the reader
with a good deal to ponder in light
of the current rhetoric manufac-
tured on both sides, Socialist
binationalism, though only
obliquely defined, is the
recognition on the parts of the
Israelis, Arabs and Palestinians,
that the only just solution to the
Mideast crisis is the establish-
ment of a blnational state, in a
larger socialist framework, that

Middle
East

peace?

would allow the Israelis anti the
Palestinians to live in mutual
cooperation, under the aegis of a
larger, representative governr
mcnt. The prospects for such a
solution seem to Chomsky, to be
the only just end to the chronic
hostilities. “A movement to create
a democratic, socialis| Palestinei
optimally, integrated into a
broader federationmthat
preserves some deglee of com-
munal autonomy and national self-
government is not beyond the
bounds ot possibility . . , Admit.
tedly, the possibilities seem
slight.” (is-ti)
One Solution

The tinge oi pessimism at the
end of the preceeding statement is
not Without justification, but the
crucial point remains this is
perhaps the only solution, tor in
commenting on the current Israeli
policy of dependence on a temporal
military superiority in conjuction
with the parallel Arab policy
lighting until they win, Chomsky
notes that, “plainly. in the long
run, the policy is suicidal. since
Israel can lose only once, and the
need to rely on a single superpower
tllie U.S) and to accept in.
creasing international isolation is
no less risky (than the arguments
of defensible boarders vs. land
concessions for a Palestinian
state) from the standpoint of
security.“ llast

Many of the specifics in his
arguments are dated
by recent developments (viz. the
Rabat conference). but the bulk of
what Chomsky says is still viable
_W|Iile one must not let Chomsky do
his or her thinking. the book, with
its inevitable lack of definitive
coherence owing to the format.
should be read and considered.
Although I am left. at times,
partially unsatisfied with the
actualities of his primary thesis.
Should the time for its im-
plementation ever come, what
Chomsky has to say (and l have
only here touched on one aspect of
his thought) is valid.

This is all important htlok
dealing head on “ill! our of the
worlds most pressing problems. i

jcct to some of it, an intcllcgent

iiipi-csent hysteria.
