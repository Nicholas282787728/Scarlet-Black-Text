Tuition examined

By Tom .irciibci-g

Like almost every other small
liberal arts college across the
country. Grinnell has been plagued
with financial difficulties. Raises
in comprehensive lees are ex-
pected to be as substantial
elsewhere ill the nation, with many
topping the $5.000 mark.

Grinnell's $350 increase will
bring in about $64,000 more
revenue, according to Dean of the
College Waldo Walker. The total
operating budget will be increased
to $7.785.180.

Walkcrsald thatrnoney acquired
from the board fee raise will be
spent to balance higher operating
costs and to provide more com.
petitive salaries. especially tor
proiessors and associate
proiessors.

41} Percent Given
lroi-Aiil

A major portion oi the increasc
in the operating budget will be
directly returned as financial aid,
Walker said that the amount of aid

proportion to the fee raise. He
added that 40 percent of the yearly
income is spent in iinancial aid.

Walker estimates that the
tsculty will receive an 3.5 percent
increase in wages next year, and
thus predicts another increase in
the comprehensive ice for 1976777,
He also cited inﬂation as a factor
for the annual climb

According to the dean, salari s
for assistant professors and
structors are competitive with
those of other small liberal arts
colleges. However. he said that
proiessoi- and associate proiessor
salaries were not.

Faculty Cuts

Whereas faculty salaries are
increasing. the number oi faculty
is decreasing, Walker said that the
number of taculty members to be
cut has not yet been determined,
“The number will be kept as
minimal as possible,” he said.
Rumors that ten to twenty staff
positions will he cut is much too
high a figure. according to Walker.

the topic in terms ofstudents rights
and said that the era was ending
when it was legitimate to protect
individuals from themselves.

President Leggett has assigned
Nicholas Ryan and Charles Seller
the responsibilty of deciding how
the amendment will aliect college

bellei that legal aid Wlll probably
be brought in to advise the ad

the law goes into cllect. Leggett
stated that “if students line up at
our offices demanding to see their
records. they may be within their
legal rights,"

response to the bill is still un-
certain. Some speculation has been
made that Willi the loss of cone
