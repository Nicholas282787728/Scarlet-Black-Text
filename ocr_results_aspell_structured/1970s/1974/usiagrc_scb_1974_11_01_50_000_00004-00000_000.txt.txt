Some may roactto the prediction
that the Democrats will win a
massive victory this Tuesday by
deciding not to vote. Such a
decision would be an unfortunate

mistake

It is clear that the Republicans
are goingto make every attempt to
cast this bigger and better Dcmr
ocratic majority in the role oi the
inflationary devil who exercises
total control over the budget and is
responsible for all of the country‘s
ills, Sweel dreams, Indeed. Un-
fortunately. they are only dreams,

V1ewpomt

The Congress has always been and
will probably continue to be
reluctant to override the
Presidential veto. Even when
override attempts are made, the
Democratic majority turns out to
be less of a majority than the

ministration against Congressional

However, regardless of how
many additional seats the
Democrats gain, the Republicans
are going to bring out the spectre ot
the “VETO-PROOF CONGRESS”
and claims oI “Destruction of the
two-party system.” In fact, Ford is
already dragging the chains, with
attacks of this sort.

If the Democarats are able to
command the majority needed to
overrride vetoes, they will be
accused of imposing their Wlll on
the country. The blame ior any
problems which ‘occur in 1976 will
lie with the Democrats. for it is
they who controlled the legislature.
“Ford tried to put the country on
the right track but didn’t have the
support of Congress," so the
argument would go,

On the other hand, if the
Democrats make significant gains,
without reaching a tworthirds
majority, as is likely, they will still
be held responsible for inﬂation

case. the Democrats will have to
contend with the, accusations of
the Republicans, without being
able to balance these accusations
with a record oi comprehensive
and innovative legislation.

These charges will be made
regardless of the political balance
oi power. Students supporting
progressive legislationare urged to
VOTE, so that a liberal Congress
will be able to assert legislative
initiative and control through the
enactment of such things as
Comprehensive National Health
Insurance, a Guaranteed Annual
Income, and antiepollution and
antitrust legislation.

Whether the Democrats can find
a candidate who can unify the
party and deieat Ford in 1975 is the
subject of much speculation and
perhaps, a iuture column, But the
Nixon policies of the Ford ad
ministration are more likely to
persist for Four More Years ii the
Democrats do not elect a Congress

Races to watch

by Jessica Olipcnlu'im

Governor

Massachusetts:
Dukakis vs. Sargent

The political gap between the incumbent,
Republican Francis Sargent and his
challenger, Democrat Michaeli Dukakis is
exceptionally small.

Dukakis isn‘t attacking Sargent on most
issues since he supported them from his seat
in the state house of representatives. In the
lead as oi now by a large margin, Dukakis
states mat the difference comes in ad-
ministration. His would be more oriicient.

With the shadow of Watergate close at
hand, Dukakls is also promising the cleanest,
most open campaign in the history oi
Massachussetts politics.

Ohio:
Gilligan vs. Rhodes

If the Massachussetts race can be
characterized by the similarity between the
candidates involved, then the Ohio race can
be seen as its direct opposite. The election
involves incumbent Democrat John Gilligan,
who fits the mold of the intellectual liberal
and Republican James Rhodes, a hardhosed
conservative oi the back-slapping, stumping
school.

Gilligan has made his reputation on
upgrading public services, such as the urn
dernourished school system. A iormer college
instructor, he is also responsible for the states
for st income tax.

Rhodes, who was the man in the Governor’s
mansion prior to Gilligan, is noted ior having
kept taxes at the lowcst level of any state in
the nation and leaving public services as they
stood.

Rhodes has a way with the public, while
Gilligan has a way with the press and also
boasts the financial backing oi organized
labor, Gilligan, at present, is ahead by a
small margin.

New York:
Carey vs. Wilson

New Yorkers may be seeing the light at the
end of the Nelson Rockefeller tunnel with the
outcome of the race between Democrat Hugh
Carey and Republican incumbent Malcom
Wilson,

Though Wilson may have proved himself a
capable administrator in the role of
Lieutenant governor, ior 15 years he will be
hardepressed to keep the Republicans in
power in Albany without the old Rockefeller
charisma, , , '

and other problems. Republicans
will accuse them or unwillingnesss
to compromise with Ford. In this

Hugh Carey has earned the reputation as a
middleol-theeroad liberal wiﬂn his moderate
environmentalist position and cautious stands
on taxes and busing. An Irish Catholic backed
by Lieutenant Governor candidate Mary
Anne Krupsak, Carey can pull in much at the
ethnic and female vote,

For his team, Wilson has made the rising
crime rate his big issue, claiming that Carey
is soft on crime. He has promised New
Yorkers a clean state, with streets and
subways free at muggers and rapists.

Senate

New York:
Clark vs. Iavits

New York is again the scene of an inc
teresting race with the battle between the
statewide standard, Jacob Javits and his
attacker, Ramsey Clark.

In 18 rather colorless years in the Senate,
Republican Javits, as a relatively liberal
Jewish New Yorker, had iairly strong support
from both liberal and conservative fronts.
Never an outspoken leader, Javils has lost
some of his liberal Vote with his delayed
reactions to the Viet Nam war and the
Watergate scandal.

Now from out of the left he is faced with
Ramsey Clark, an outspoken liberal from
Texas who has been wooing New Yorkers
from Javits' Side. His famous plays include
his notorious trip to Hanoi during the war,
where he attacked US, policy.

Clark was also one of the first to speak out
against the Nixon administration’s
wiretapping policies, long beiorc it became
fashionable with the onset of Watergate.

Javits still maintains his lead, though it is
rrighteningly narrow, with elections so near.

Kansas:
Boy vs. Dole

A race that has been close from the
beginning is the senate campaign going on in
Kansas between incumbent Senator Roberl
Dale and Democratic Congressman William
R0 ,

Each candidate is faced with a label which
Will hurt at the polls. For Dole it is his his
volvcment witll Watergate, a position which
will take most of the money in his expensive
campaign to overcome.

William Roy, a medical doctor, musl
contend with the stamp or abortionist. He has,
as an obstetrician, delivered many babies
and has openly performed several legal

abortions , .
Roys' campaign issue seem to rest on his

supportoi public health and a strong stand on
environmental problems. Roy currently holds
a commanding lead.

in 1974 which is capable of enacting
legislation which bear

progressive Democratic stamp.

Iowa’s First District Republican James

JAMES SCIIABEN

The 1974 Iowa Governor‘s race appears to
be a typical case of challenger versus in-
cumbent, with Iowa State Senate Democratic
leader, Jim Schaben, going against
Republican Governor, Robert Ray. Schaben
as challenger has taken the oltensive
throughout the campaign accusing the third
term governor or being a big spender who
advocates policies that tend to hurt low and
middle~income groups, Ray, on the other
hand. feels that Schaben‘s candidacy has
been run on a stream ot “constant criticism”
that lacks any real substance.

_ Schaben’s major criticisms were outlined
in an eight page tabloid which Ray has since
termed “deceitlul garbage." Schaben’s
literature states ”In six years Robert Ray has
doubled the state budget, added too people to
the state payroll each month and-raised
personal income tax by a third.” Ray refutes
