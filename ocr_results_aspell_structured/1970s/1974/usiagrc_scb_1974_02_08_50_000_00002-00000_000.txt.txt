Fuel'Crisis Shuts Down Ice Machine,

Many places have gotten colder

in Grinnell, the ice on Barber P17

because oi the fuel shortage.

mes Hamilton said Monday that the

Arts Center, which normally sups
plies cooling power tor the skating
rink, will not he used this year.
Hamilton said that, in past years,
using the Fine Arts unit has put

severe strain on the equipment and
has cost the College over $1,000
for power.

Jean King, assistant professor Di

that the unit “had neverbeenstrong
enough" to maintain useable ice
during warm periods oi the winter,

King, who has coordinated skating
activities on the Barber rink, said
that she thinks the ice now on the
rink, which was Irozen naturally
after the area was ﬂooded with
hoses, will probably last almost

as long without using the compres~
sor as it would have if the equip—
men! were kept in operation.

She added that members of Grins
hell’s hockey team will work the
remainder of the winter to keep
the ice in useable condition, [or
both hockey practice and general
student use.

King estimated that the College
has about three dozen pairs ouig-
lire skates, valued at about $400,
in the Physical Education complex

GENERAL TELEPHONE MID-WEST DISTRICT HEADQUARTERS

11th Kl PRAIRIE STREETS

For the past two years thousands
oi lowa residents, including off-
campus students at five colleges in
the state, have been aliected by
General Telephone Company rate
increases, initiated in April, 1972,

Customers were notitied oi the
change at that time, and collection
at the increase began in August.
The campuses anecied includeWalr
dorr College, Forest City; South-
western Community College, Cres-
ton; Western Community College,
Clarinda; Lakes Community Coll-
ege, Emmetshurg, and Grinnell.

The rate increase was the Iirst
since 1963 On January 4, the Iowa
Commerce Commission ruled Gene
eral Telephone’s increase unjust.
The IICC rationale for the ruling
was that the phone company would
be receiving n 14 per cent return
on equity, as opposed to the l2 per
cent rate of return which the Come
mission regards as lair.

As a matter oi standard operat-

ing procedure, General Telephone .

was given twenty days lo respond to
the Commerce Commission’s order
that they reiund a total or $2.7
million dollars to their customers.

On January 24, the Company peti»
tioned tor a reharlng belore the
ICC The Commission has 30 days
to consider General Telephone’s
request.

Ahoui February 24, the ICC must
respond to General Telephone, eit~
her allowing a rehearing permit»
her allowing a rehearing, permit»
ting no rehearing, (in which case
General Telephone has recourse to
appeal that decision) or providing
the Company with no reply, in which
case the increased rates will con-
tinue to he collected, as they are
now. ’

In the event that General Tele—
phone musi provide reiunds, spoke-
phone must provide refunds, spoke
esman Bruce Kotchey asserted that
all college students cliected by the
increase during the 197243 aca—
demic year will be repaid in lull
whenever possible.

The remainder of the phone coms
pany’s customers will be billed ior
luture service in much smalleram~
ounts, rather than receiving a lump
sum for repayment. Over 200 Grin,
nell students are affected, with 132
registered as ottrcampus with tele—
phones during the 1972773 year.
