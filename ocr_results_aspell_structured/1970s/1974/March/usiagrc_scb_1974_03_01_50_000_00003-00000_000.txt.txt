HEALTH CENTER CHECK- UP

Students Complain About Health Services

(Ed. note—Jeri Z in this series
on Grinnell health care examines
student opinions and grievances all—
out college health services.

Responses obtained in a recent
survey represent a broad spectrum
of opinion, both from personal ex-
periences at the Health Center and
from the efficient operation of the
“institutional grapevine."

Because the questionnaire asked
for command only from students
who were NOT satisfied with ”the
health services offered by Grinnell
College,".primari negative coul-
inents were received.

Part 3 of this series will look all
health services from the view oithe
practitioners, rather than that of
the patients.)
by John Turnbull and Louise Dix

The ad hnc Committee to investi-
gate the Health Center recently
conducted a survey to explore stue
dent opinions aboutthe college health
service. Comments that were rer
Ceived varied from “I think that
they are doing what they can” to
"The Health Center is a great
place to visit, but I wouldn't...”

Out of a total of 366 responses,
314 students expressed some sort
of dissatisfaction with the present
health care service altered.

Out of the 52 students who said
they were satisﬁed with the ser—
vices offered, several of them ex-

pressed positive Comments such
as

» -“I think that the services are
sufficiently adequate for those who
have only ‘shortterm' illness, which
they very well specify in their pur-
pose etc. Students should realize
that in a town of this size and with
the nearncss of the local hospital,
the services provided at the Health
Center are adequate.”
----“lt's better than any Air Force
or Army dispensary I've ever been
I t.
- “When I had mono, they gave
me the peace and quiet lneeded."
--——“I used the Health Center for
three days when 1 had the flu and
I thought they did a good job."
But the majority oi the comments
were negative and criticallnnature.
There were many suggestions on-
ered for the improvement of the
present services. The need for a’
doctor in the Health Center raised
the largest numbers of comments
with 131 students feelingthatthereis
such a need on campus. As one put
it, “I would expect the healthcenter
to know enough of what they are
doingr-the nurses say, ‘Well,idon't
know, but..’ Why don’t they know?
There should be adoctortheretoo."
Other comments receivedincluded:
a---“There should be a qualified
physician on 24-hour cal’l who can
do more than give you an ace band.
age and an aspirin.”
mw'l'hey (the nurses) don’t really
act as anything more than ascreen-

lng deviceiorlocaldoctors.

As this last comment suggests,not
everyone is satisfied with thequality
or effectiveness of the care they
receive at the center. Seventy-six
students responded on this topic.
These responses included such
things as:
~rrr”l don’t think thatitgivessufi'i»
cient attention to many, people’s ill-
nesses by saying, ‘You’ll be all
right, go home and sleep, etc."‘

Another comment made was that
”the nurses have always been very
nice, but very little help. lhave
visited the Health Center several
times and although they are reSr
trlcted in what they are allowed to
do, I have never received anytreat-
_ment that was at any use. I have
always been told to go to the doctor
at my own expense.”

One student also saidthatbasically ‘
three thingswerewrong atthe center
including “wrong diagnosis, un-
friendly people, general incompe-
tence." Others noted:
~rrr“l was once given two pain-
killers which should never have
been mixed and it caused me to
almost be hospitalized." ’
.mulld never go to that place
unless i was dying and there was
nothing more they could do to hurt
me.” l

Another major complaint was the
lack of a gynecologist on campus
or in the town itself. There were
56 students who saw a need for a
gynecologist. Suggestions included
having a gynecologist come to the
college once a week or providing
transportation to gynecologicalcare
in iowa City or Des Molnes, “There
is an obvious and serious need for
some sort of specialized gynecolo»
gical service....Something must be
done. Women on this campus ob-
viously need gynecologicalattention,

Where can one pick up a good 59,
cond-hand brain, a cutrrate heart,
a solid sense of courage, or a bal—
loon ride to Kansas? Why, at the
“Annual Big StudentrFaculty Aucr
tion," of Course! This year’s fes-
tivitles will he held at 9:30 pm,
Friday, March 8 at one of Amer-
ic‘a's great marketplaces, Darby
Gymnasium.

Unlike all previous years when
half of the money received was dos
nated to “charitable" organizations,
the entire proceeds fromthis year’s
auction will be given to the campus
radio station, KDlC-FM, in order
to replace and maintain some of
its older and more expensivebroad-
casting equipment. Station ollicials
said there is currently no money
in reserve to cover major equip
ment failures. They are especially
concerned about the station’strans—
mitter, which is KDIC's single most
expensive piece of equipment.

The “Caller” for this event will
be Dick Sears who has donated his
services at Grinnell auctions for
more than ten years i

“What exactly does one find at
an ‘Annual Big Student-Faculty Auc-

and the problem cannot be ignored
any longer,” stated one student.

Birth control counseling and diSr
tribution was another topic of cone
cern. One student stated that there
was a need for birth control serr
vices “to provide information on
sex, drugs, v. o., etc. it could ‘rer
place what Revolving Door once
provided,"

Additional remarks were:
»-—-“Perhaps the Health Center
could play a more active role in
the college’s lite. For one thing,
we could certainly use some em-
phasis on women’s health prob»
lems; lor another, there is a lot
of very useful, important informa-
tion (if only in the form of book-
lets) that they could dispense,”
~---“No birth control information
and, on this campus we need it.
I never go to the Health Center
because there advice is no better
than the kids' here.”

Along with the Question of dis-
pensing birth controldevices and/or
information, came the question of
the dispensing oi medicines in gen-

eral. .

”The inability of the staff to
administer drugs, prescriptions,
counseling is difficult to work with.
Even simple advice about health
aids or tips to get over a virus
would be nice."

- “Anytime I go there, no matter
what’s wrong, they just give me
the same old yellow cold Capsules
and useless cough medicine.”
"nuyor a sore throat, they lumpr
ed me With three kinds of reme-
dies, said'one might work. Please
let them know which one.”

Office hours and visiting hours
also Were gripes of the Students
surveyed.

----“Stupid visiting ruleswshould

day. Intensive care allows more

my friends, is just about anything
imaginable. For example, Bob Jae
cobs has donated all the beer four
people can drink. Other ”sure-
sell” items includethe“President’s
Dinner” (for eight persons) ieatur-
ing “leg or Leggett,” the “Dean's
Dinner" (for six, and you can real»
ly “spill your beans” if you like)
with WaldoWalker,anoriginalDem-
inolii painting, two world»ianious
deLecluse cakes (not the originals,
however), five John Wylie dartbOr
ards, untold boxes of KDlC records,
and, in addition to these, South
Campus' residentgourmet, “Soggy”
Dave McConnell is donating a com-
plete foreign menu dinner (buyer’s
choiceﬁhe’ll cook anything) ioriour

or course, it you wish, you can

. donate Just about anything you can

think of: services, parties, dinners,
bric-a—brac, crude oil, chunks or
coal, Edsells, pets. . .even room,
mates i suppose (What do i hear
for a “John Williams7”). If in
doubt, contact Dale Scherler (ext.
516), Frank Stoller (ext. MB), or
Michael Harris (ext. 218) and
they'll set you straight about who

than that "
- "For one thing, the hours are
poor; who gets sick from B-ltl:30
or 12:30»z:307"

The personality or the stall and the
atmosphere of the Health Center

were commented upon by many of
the students

--»-”Tnis is nota drop- in place»
by the very atmosphere, one can't
bring up birth control, nutrition
problems (i.e. vegetarianism and a
balanced diet, etc.). perhaps infor—
mation seminars on health issues
could be held there.”
----“lmpersonal is very hard to
trust the nurses. Nobody talks to
you (when you stay there)"

----“l’ve been quite unhappy with
the overall attitudes of Certain per
sonnel at the Health Center...studer
nts' needsmustconformtotnerules,
instead of having the rules conform
to the needs of the students.”

The doctors in town were alsocri-
ticized for their attitudes and their
“incompetence." "A more intimate
Dr. - Health Service relationship"
was asked for.

Many students seemed to feel that
the Health Service fee was a com-
plete waste of money for what they
received for that fee.

-- —“i never use the Health Center
and resent paying $45 for Tria-
minicin.

« rnr $45,1Cduld provide myr
self with inﬁnite quantities of Can-
tac and cough syrup..,l deﬁnitely
feel i'm not getting my money’s
worth.”

”.411 think the Health Centerwas-
tes a lot of money because people
don't use it very much. ”

Transportation or the lack therea
ol was brought up by a lew stu—
dents.

A- -“If some kind of transporta-
tion to and from the hospital for
sick students would be arranged,
it would be a lot more humane.
w-“l walked in with a sore loot
and they did not know what was

wrong, but they didn’t think it was
sprained. They suggested that I
walk down to a doctor’s olfice (six
blocks away) about it I took a
taxi, and found out that I had a
broken loot. "

Several of the students who res—
ponded to the survey admitted that
they had never used the Health
Center facilities but were still neg»
ative about the services because of
things they had heard about it.
One student remarked that he had
never used the place but he had
“heard so many had things about
it.”

One student said, “i fear getting
sick and having to go there because
of what has been said about the
service “

A student who freguently dealt with
the Health Center, concluded, “Let's
either close the Health Center al-
together, or drastically overhaul

,n

its role at the college!!.

or what you may give away. Or, if,
you preler, drop a line in the
KDIC box in the Post Office deSr
cribing the article (or service) that
you wish to ”unload” and they’ll
even come and pick it up,

it you happen to support lndolence,
you can bring the stud to the aucA

cannot make it, fear not, for you

thought of contingencies for every
thing!)

So mark down Friday, March a

tions, get a wheelbarrow full of
money and truck on out to Darby

don’t forget, budget Credlt'terrns
are available. .Honestly, you
Can’t find deals better than those
