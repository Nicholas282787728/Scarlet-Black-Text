The alleged racistactivities of Wo-
odworth and Abler did not beginlast

em previous semesters, according
to CBS spokesmen.

There are claims by CBS that Abe

comments on racialbackgrounds and
student competence that betray a
bias.

This bias is further documented,
continued the spokesmen, by thegr-
ades received by black students in
their classes,“Everystudentwrites
one or two bad papers, but consis-
tent C’s are hard to believe."

Further allegations concernadopt—

system is racist, and the claim a},

Main Thrust

The main thrust of the black po»
sition dealt with the Administra—
tion's alleged attempt to join the
Sociology and Anthropology depart

. merits by compromising the viabil—
ity oi the Sociology department.

They further content that when
Paul Metzger was hired there was
no intention of rehiring him, and
that this was evidenced by his title;
Visiting Associate Professor of Sov
ciology.

They continue that they are in ”no
way pleading Metzger’s case,” but
they they were attempting “to raise
the campus’ level or awareness”
to what is happenmg.

When asked how many channels
CBS exhausted, they responded that

dents at which Ms. Abler was con-
fronted at several ouier meetings,

when asked it they thought that
they had gone too far, the ans—
wer came, “What would you have
done in this situation? Next ques~
tiunr”

They were asked if they thought
ihel'r action was Suicidal. The aHSr
wer was a deﬁnite yes, but one
spokesman summed the organiza-
tional position by saying, “what
are we supposed to do? Sit On our
hands? Black Studean on this Cam-
pus commit academic suicide eve
ery day, a little extra today can't
really hurt us,"

Response

Woodworth and Abler denied the
charges at racism. ln a letter to
sociology majors dated Wednesday,
they also denied that they were a
“monolithic dyad," and Said that
they were not trying to seize con»
trol of the department.

They said that they had “fought
from Wednesday to Saturday of last
week to keep the third position in
the department, and we lost,” They
urged recipients of the letter to
voice support tor them to Leggett
and Walker “if you disagree” with
the CBS statement.

Black Faculty

Ln response to the CBS allegation
that, "During the past four years,
out Of sixteen black faculty and
stall members, only four have re-
mained at Grinnell for a period of
one year," Hamilton Thursday re-
leased figures that showed:

Decision~Making

Another allegation, that Black fac-
ulty members “are not given full
conSideration in departmental de-
cision-making processes” brought
mixed responses from Black lac»
ulty,

Cecil Lytle said he “definitely
agreed" that the statementwastrue,

,but declined further comment. He
said he and other Black faculty
would issue a statement within the
next week.

Rogers Gurira said that he had not
been at GrinnelJ long and that he
felt he did not have sufficient infor-
mation to make a judgement

Clifford Reid refused to comment
on the charge. Three other Black
faculty —» Peter Bodunrin, Charles
Davis, and Marily Leonard ~ could
not be reached for comment on the
charge.

Other Grinnellians eat special die
ets on a voluntary rattler than med-
ical basis. The vegetarians repre-
sent the largest such group, and
Saga has tried to accomodate their
requests.

Saga changes its prepared menus,
which come from its home office
in Menlo Park, Calilornia, so that
meatless items are offered atevery
meal,

Although served in both dining
halls, the meatless items with
higher protein content are empha—
sized at Quad. Jerry Ramaker, Food
service director, commented that
Saga labels the special items “me-
atless” instead of “vegetarian”due
to a difference otoplnion with some
students about whatconstitutesa ve~
getarian meal.

Another special area that Saga
covers is bakery goods. Aided by
a helper, pastry chef Don Phillips
creates the baked desserk and SD-
ecial breads daily except Sunday,
Located beneath Quad, the bakery
has been operating tor 32 years.
Ramaker considers Phillips “tre—

In 1923, Watt became editor and
publisher oi the Storm Lake Regis-
ter, a position he held until he pur—
chased the majority interest in the

Grinnell Herald-Register in 1944. .

LB. Watt

Watt served as president or the
lowa Press Association in 194849,
and was awarded the association's
highest honor, the Master Editor—

Publisher title, in 1955.

He was active in many civic or
ganizations in Grinnell, villisca,and

case of special food nights where
the number of entrees is apt to
be large and specialized, Other-
wise, food preparation is handled
entirely by Saga personnel,

Ramaker emphasizedthatthe cook-
ing is usually done the same day an
item is served,despite the 500 meals
which must be served on each cam-
pus at each meal. Produce and veg-
stables are cleaned and prepared
the day before serving, allowing
more time for cooking items Such
as meats. ‘

Two women on each campus begin
the-breakfast preparation at 6 am.
and are finished by '7 a.mi, whenthe
food for lunch starts its path to the
palate. When the doors open for lu-
nch at 11 a.m., dinner preparation
has already swung into action.

Criticism has been leveled at Sae
ga concerning nutritionalstandards.
in 1972, an inedepth, student-re-
quested nutritional study was run
on Saga load.

The visiting nutritionalisthadnnli—
mited access to recipes, weekly
menu plans and made unannounced
checks on iood and storeroomsupp-
lies. The resulting technical opine
ion was that there was ample nu»
tritional value in the variety of!-
ered. . ,

Pomerenk stated that people must,
however, eat correctly and pick up
a variety of items, instead oicon—
sistently eating cakesand otherlow-
nutritional items. He mentionedthat
the list of items offered every day
in line and on the salad bar is con-
siderable, and surprisedthevisiting
