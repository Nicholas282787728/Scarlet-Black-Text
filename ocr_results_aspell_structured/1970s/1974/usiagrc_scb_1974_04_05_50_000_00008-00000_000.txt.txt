CONGRATULATIONS to Bob

eI-ican swimmer. Winters. triple
event winner in the conference
meet. placed 10th in the 100 yard
backstroke at the NCAA College
Division swimming and diving ch-
ampionships held at the beginning
of spring break.

Site for the meet was the beautr
iiul Belmont Plaza pool in Long
Beach, California. Winters. 3 jun»

swimming 54 6 to qualiiy 11th. He
also finished 22nd in the 200 yard
backstroke. with a mark of 2:07
Both times are new Grinnell vars-
ity records.

but the Trojans took second to
win the title. The meet featured
no less than five new American
records. offsetting a dissappointing
periormance by John Kinsella oi

Indiana who failed badly [sixth
twice! in his bid to be the first
swimmer ever to win the 500 and
1 650 yard freestyle titles for four
years in a row. The meet marked
the end of the Olympic star‘s
career.

MORE BAD PREDICTIONS:
Iowa State not winning the NCAA
wrestling title as predicted (taking
fifth with Oklahoma winningl.
UCLA. also once thought to be
invincible, did not win the NCAA
basketball title as predicted Wars
the Carolina State beat Marquette
ior that one). Spring predictions:

Arizona. Arizona State. Texas.

for the Atlanta Braves ians lwho

torsee Henry Aaron hit his 714th

But not playing him in the iirst
games at Cinncinnati for this
reason would not be good for

feels that he can. Baseball com
missioner Bowie Kuhn was correct
in “advising" Braves owner Bill
Bartholomey that- Aaron should
play against the Reds. Also. it is
time that some sports iranchise
owners stop chasing the almighty
dollar. NBC television will follow
Aaron around until the two home-
runs are hit and will preempt
scheduled shows if needed to give
reports on the home run effort.
One must remember that Aaron is
not just I home run hitter but a
.300 hitter who knocks in nearly
100 RBI‘s a season for the Braves.

Diamondmen Drop Opener

by Marty Iker

Tuesday was a close to -perfect
spring day. But it was closer to
perfect Ior William Penn than
Grinnell as the Statesmen downed
the Pioneers 103 in the non con-
ference season opener on the
North Field. The game had a good
turnout and the spectators were
treated to an event that wasn't
listed on the Activities Calendar
when three Grinnell men streaked
around and across the diamond
halfway through the game.

Grinnell mounted scoring threats
in the lust and iourth innings
before cracking the ice in the
seventh. In the iirst. shortstop
Craig Zippe walked. stole second
and third. He attempted to Score
on a wild pitch but was called out
at home on a disputed call when it
was ruled that he had failed to
touch the plate. In the fourth.
pitcher Wes Fujii walked and
John Haigh followed with Grin-
nells first hit. a booming triple to
left Center. However. due to a
baserunning mixup. Fujii was ca.
ught in a rundown between third
and home.

Batting with one out in the
seventh. Haigh again sent a long
left held that
actually cleared the fence but was
pulled back in with a magnilicent
backhand catch by the Penn outfi-
elder. However. Paul Delaney fol.
lowed with a double and scored
when Bill Johnson did the same.
Johnson was then driven in by
Mark Hnnisch‘s single to right.
Grinnell's third run Came in the
eighth inning when Wes Fujii
again walked and was advanced to
second by Craig Zippes sharp
single into left center field Zippe

Neimen Eye Good Season

by John Lom
The new greemnggrass, the fuels
low an», the buddIng tules. and the
gentle singing of birds all point
to the arrival of Spring? No
stupid! It’s tennis Season lime. With
seven returning lettermen irom last
year's squad and a crop load of
talented freshmen. this year's Gr-
inIIell college tennis team appears
to be destined for greal success.

New coach Thomas Vanderhyden.
ieels optimistic about the Pioneer’s
chances this year because oi the
apparent increase oi depth on the
squad. This is evIdent in that with .
less than a week to go before the
iirst conierence match len players
are stIll deadlocked In a vIcIous
scramble to claim the six posir
tions on the varsily learn. Senior
Brad Vazales. last year's number
one singles player and Conierence
semIrIInalIst, appears will retain
hIs premier posItIon. but the rest
or the rankings are stillpretty much
up in the air,

Along with Vazales. other returne
ing members irom last year’s team.
are Andy Bloom, Neil Trablch, RIr
cky Keller. Lee Lasky. Paul Van
Schilfgaarde;.llm iloiiert. Dave Brr
amal‘l. and John Lom. To complir
ment lhese hardened vets are new.
comers Bob Rossen, Dan Edwards.
MItch Schoen. palirwIn.loeTopper,
Geoff Wyatt and Mark Krluchenia.

LookIng iorward lo tomorrow’s
match agaInsi Monmouth College,
Vanderhyden predicts an easy vice
tory against nteam lhat barely de-
feated the Ploneers’ J.V. squad last

steamed around first and headed
for second before he realized that

Fujii had not gone around to
third. so he had to reverse field
quickly and scramble back to first
base. Penn's throw to first was
wide of the mark allowing Zippe
to get back saiely and Fujii to
advance to third.

After a confident Penn pitcher
said “Ho nint goin nowhere"
zippe stole his third base oi the
game putting both men in
scoring position Dave Wynberg
followed with a single. driving in
Fujii. but Zippc was again called
out at home.

Although tagged for ten runs by
the Penn offense. Grinnell's pitch
ing staii looks quite promising.
Plagued by wildness and a jittery
defense. less than five runs were
earned.

Wes Fujii pitched the first five
innings and looked good desite
sporadic control problems. He gar
ve up seven runs. only four oi
which were earned. Paul Delaney
iollowed with three scoreless inn-
ings. He gave up only one hit but
walked four.

Dave Gates made his pitching
debut in the ninth inning and
looked sharp. I-Iis control was
excellent. as he struck out the
first man and got the next two to
ground to the right side. This
should have gotten him out oi the
inning. but two errors allowed
these two men to reach base and
subsequently, three unearned runs
to score. I

Despite the loss. there were
many bright spots in this game
for Grinnell. First. the pitching
staii has shown its great poten.
tial. Second. the offense appears
to be much improved over last
season.‘ and third of all. the
defense promises to be solid.
though it had its shaky moments

With this game under their belts
and a knowledge of what they
have to work on, the Pioneers
have been preparing for their
conference opener at Goa tomor-
row and should be ready to go.
