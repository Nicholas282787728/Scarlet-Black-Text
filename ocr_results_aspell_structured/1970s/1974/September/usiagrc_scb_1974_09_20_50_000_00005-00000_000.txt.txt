Weekend emphasises careers

by Tom Arenberg

“Generally. l was pleased,”

alumni executive secretary
Dorothy Palmer said about the
alumni weekend that ended Sun»
day afternoon. The conierence
covered two days of iormal
iscussions and informal social
gatherings that occurred on
campus and at the Grinnell
Country club

Thirty ive representatives and'

22 alumni admissions volunteers,
along with administration, laculty
and students, attended the con-
ference. Alumni organization
coordinator Jan German said that
all of the invited alumni attended.
Among those were persons who
had graduated as early as um and
as recently? ast’ye

ddcd that she was pleased with’

the campus response especially

with that of the students, who had

never been involved before.
Loves Grinnell

Some alumni said they are active
in alumni programs because they
love Grinnell and are still loyal to
it. ”It meant a lot to me and it. still
does," one alumni said.

However, when another member
was asked why he still cared about
Grinnell, he rcplie “I didn't until
Kcame back. I didn’t until I Went to

‘the football game and even though
we were getting killed 33-8, the
stands were packed and the tans
went wild when it bacame 33-14. I
didn’t until I went to a prot’s house
and people just kept dropping in
and talking all night. No where else
in America would those things
happen. Bringing back the alumni
is the best thing a meeting like this
can do.”

The eonlerence began Friday

ith the alumni becoming
i acquainted with the college and
each other. Saturday started with
an opening session and small group
discussions about Grinnell’s
future.

One member said the
discussions, because of their in
lormallty, were ”the only wor»
thwhile talk sessions on the
schedule”. The aspect that con-
cerned almost all groups was

hether or not Grinnell was

adequately careeroriented. Most
groups sta d that the college had a
responsibi ty to help prepare the
students [or a career, and that the
college did so.

Howcvcr, Dcall Waldo Walker
maintained that “Grinncll will
continue to bc a liberal arts college
until liberal arts colleges are dead
and gone" Most of the groups did.
howcvci. iavoi expansion of

srojects similar to the San
riancisco career internship
program

Worth the money
Another concern was how to

convince the students that G‘l-in'n'ell~ '

is worth the money needed to at
tend—a sun that Walker said might
have to be increased due to inc
flation. He continued by saying
that exploitation of Grinnell’s
“personalness” may be the key.

“The personal attention received
at Grinnell is an unbeatable,
positive gain,” he emphasized. He
explained Grinnell’s 124. student
laculty ratio and said he would
“throw them up against any other

' instutution in the country.”

in summary ol the Saturday
morning discussions, Palmer
reported that although the groups
had stated no goals or objectives,
concerns had been brought into
locus, with the main concern being
whether or not Grinnell provided

Today marks one week since the
beginning of the “hour lockup ot
all loggia and residence hall doors.
During the week there have been
numerous persons locked out
because oi [oi-gotten keys which
“may account,” according to
James Tederman, dean of student
affairs. “(or broken doors in
Norris, Main, and in the loggia at
Haines and James."

Another two weeks

“As it looks now. the lockup will
continue for at least another two
weeks," reported Tederman. “But
it people give it a chance and aloe
ept it, the lockup may continue
indefinitely.” He added “although
the lockup may be an the
convenience, it is the only way to
otter any security other than in-
dividual rooms,”

Tederman said that talking with
resident advisors last Tuesday did
not reveal that any major com-
plaints have been voiced against
the new procedure “However
there've been a low cases where
doors have been blocked or tied
open in addition to the three
broken.”

Saturday alternoon

No tangible accomplishments
were made at the separate
meetings, lor just representatives
and alumni according to Palmer.
She said. “You can’t program the
same things lor each area. Each
club area is a ditfel‘ent case," She
said that she believed the
representatives went home in
spired to institute whatever they
thought useful, and that support
was the best thing the alumni office
could ofier.

During the past week of the
lockup there have not been any
reports received by the oilice oi

However, some thelts are reported
directly to the Grinnell police
department, as Colleen Conway
did.

Conway’s new fivevspeed bike
was taken either late Sunday night
or early Monday lrom Clark hall.
“I reported it to the police Monday
afternoon," she said, “Then
Tuesday morning they called me
and said they recovered it, saying
only that it was a group of boys
from town who took it.”

Roger Koester said that as a result
of the conterence, “the volunteers

they’re supposed to do," He said
he expects the volunteers to

students and have more secondary
Contact with them.

Aware olchanges
According to Palmer and
Koester. the best aspect of the
weekend was that it brought
alumni back and made them aware
of the changes that had occurred
since they left. German added that
it was the first time that alumni,
administration, faculty and
students had been lormally
brought together lor interaction".

so glorious “

”Well. I don't know Irving. Do
you really think they'll like it?"

“it can't fail. All we have to do is
have a “Sltrln” about something.
Anything will do "

“But lrving, there aren’t any
important issues that we can
legitimately protest about,"
despaired the Chairman

“We can always invent
something Hmmmlnm, I've got
it," irving yelled yubliantly. “We
can protest the B in G strike.”

“Irving, that’s lantastic, slicer
genius,” the leader applauded.
“But one question, whose sidc are
we on? You see, I’m kind of new at
this and 1 don't know What to do.”

“It's simple," Irving replied.
“We support whoever is against
the College. That's the way all of
the revoluntionary books tell you to
do it.”

“But then. what do we do?”
queried the Chairperson.

“Well according to my in-
troductory book, The
Revolutionary Render. we should
occupy the Administration
Building and write a statement
expressing our concerns. We could
start it: ‘We the people . . .' Just
like the Constitution Boy, then the
Alumni will really get sentimental.
They'll probably give thousands of
dollars to the College.”

“Irving that's wonderful," the
delighted chairman said “But are
you sure the Alumni will like it’:m

“Of course they will! After all,
we're doing this whole thing [or
them."
