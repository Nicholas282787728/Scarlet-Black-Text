Back in the winter of i895s96
students at Grinliell were really
living it up. The gray days or their
parents were rapidly being
replaced by the “Gay Nineties."
The Columbian Exposition of 1892-
93 in Chicago's Jackson Park
ushered in the electrical era, The
Great White Way was made white
by the first large public display of
electric lights.

The kerosene lamps in Mears
Cottage went out and in came
”bulbs," hanging [mm the ceiling.

a collision course. Though strife
has occurred between some
multinational corporations and
their host countries, Learson
pointed out that it is entirely Within
the best interests oi a company to
keep peace with their host country.

In regard to the argument ot
multinationals controlling the
governments of their hosts
countries, Learson countered,
“Multinationals have only one
powe'rithe power to invest." He
emphasized that the sovereign
nations have the power to make the
laws which the foreign companies
must obey.

Exportation oi jobs, capital and
technology is attacked in the fifth
myth. Learsen argued that in-
dustries went oversees because
they could not compete any other
way. He added, “By manufac-
turing abroad We hold a market we
would otherwise lost." He felt it
would be a tragic mistake to heard
all our technological knowledge.

Learson summed up his speech
on a positive note. “Much of the
critictsm often directed to
multinationals is true to a limited
degree, It is true often enough to
perpetuate the myths that have
grown. Men run them and men are
not perfect But the multinationals
deserve more than just criticism.
They are a valuable contribution to
the economic and soClal well~being
of the world’s people. They
promote international uns
derstanding.”

After listening to Mr. Learson’s
lectures and in some cases talking
with him informally, Students
made both positive and negative
comments in regard to their en-
Counters.

“Learson showed good verbal
agility, as evidenced by his lungs
Windedness and extreme ﬂuency at
saying nothing," commented one
student.

After listening to the Monday
night lecture, Dennis Walters
remarked, “His speech per se did
not allow his personality to come
out. [Lyon talk to him on a more
individual basis, you can see how
he got to his petition. He has very
strong views on the role ct cor-
poration in a capitalistic society.

Commenting on questions that
the audience posed to Mr. Learson
after the lecture, Dennis said,
“There were some really asinine
questions about the relevance ot
capitalism that were totally unr
called for in such a discussion
about the rcsponsibility of cor
porations, They (those people)
showed their ignorance ot the

matter as well as a lack of respect

for Mr. Learson,”

But Edison did more than lighten
and brighten your life, he filled the

DURING THE Christmas
vacation of 139536 the national
news media were reporting the
discovery in Germany of a strange
new radiation that enabled Prof,
Roentgen to “see" through opaque
objects like wood and skin. but not
bones. He could “see” the bones in
his hand. Almost immediately
Prof, Almy was able to repeat the
experiment here in Grinnell.

The physics museum had its
inception in a desire to bring
phySlcs to Grinnell Students
through its rich history, em-
phasizing it as “natural
philosophy" within the context oi
contemporary cultural and
technological changes, The chief
argument tor an historical setting
is that in the great discoveries, like
the electron in 1887 by J.J.
Thomson, the experimental set-up
is usually relatively simple. it the
complexity ot the apparatus masks
the “idea” the phenomena would
never have been discovered.

THE MODERN XVRAY tube and
associated equipment that tills a
lead lined room in the local
hospital hears little resemblance to
Almy's tabletop setup, yet the
lesson~tn»be-learned is the same.
Teaching physics historically
required that we salvage
everything possible from the past.
I use the word “salvage" ad-
visedly. In the early 1930‘s we were
using students on “made work”—
the forerunner of the WPA in 1935.

Several students were employed
by Almy to “clean up the place;"
(the second and third floors of
Goodnow) much of the ac-
cumulation of the years that was
unidentifiable and obsolete was
thrown out. I made several trips to
the college dump with these same
students to recover and salvage
equipment. Some of these are now
among the choicest pieces in the
museum.

Some of the more interesting
apparatus includes electrical
equipment brought to Grinnell
from Davenport when lowa
College moved here just prior to
the Civil War. Just how this
equipment survived the tornado ol
1m is not clear, as both college
buildings were destroyed and the
ruins ot the one housing the
sciences burned.

THE SMITIISONIAN Institution
in Washington was founded in 1846,

some of the early electromagnetic
apparatus is almost identical to
those in the Smithsonian, The most
extensive and complete collections
are in acoustics, optics.

dating back to the 1390's. Much of
this equipment was purchased new

hope to incorporate a series oi

In cooperation with the National
Bicentennial the museum has
arranged a special display, which
was timed to be unveiled on Sep-
tember 5th, the date on which the
Continental congress met at in-
dependence Hall. The central
feature of the exhibit is a 200 year
old mathematicsesurveying
“cyphering book" written by lsaac
Millar in 1774. The book has been
loaned to the museum by Harriet
Millar Gale,

ISAAC was Mrs, Gale’s great-
greatrgreatrgreat grandfather and
wrote the book while apprenticed
to a surveyor. He later became the
State Surveyor of Virginia. About
50 years ago the book was
exhibited at the State Historical
Society, University of Wisconsin.
The book is unique in that the first
text printed in America did not
appear until Nicholas Pike's
“Arithmetic" in 1788.

. Script books were in general use
in the States during the early ’80’s.
The display also features the
College‘s tirst physics text book,
used in Davenport, and printed
about 1850. For “atmosphere” the
display includes other
memorabilia such as a 46 star [lag
that hung along side a black-
bnrdered picture of McKinley
during the month of mourning,
following McKinley‘s

assassination, Sept. 5, 1901, in
Buffalo.

This special display will be
dismantled during the last week in
October and we invite students and
facility to take a look.

THE MUSEUM operates without
funds and up to now has made icw
attempts to acquire additional
material We have, however, made
our interests known to some
alumni and friends and have
become a repository at a wide
variety of Grinnell treasures,
everything train a well tattered
HonorG flag to the medical kit of a
lady doctor (Grinnellian ’89).

One alumnae wanted to endow a
chair of physics but the best she
could do was to give us a solid
porcelain bed~panl These latter
two items will be part oi our
premedical display as soon as we
have additional space. Further
plans include an exhibit of ap-
paratus made by students during
the 1935 WPA program and an
unusual collection of Japanese war
loot consisting of electrical and
optical equipment.

This booty was in a cache or-
dered to be destroyed, and was
salvaged by Grinnellians who
couldn’t bring themselves to
destroy it. What to do with it? In a
day when families no longer have
houses with big attics and
basements, or barns, or sheds it is
easier to throw it away than save
it, But two hundred years ironi now
even your text-books may be in~
teresting!
