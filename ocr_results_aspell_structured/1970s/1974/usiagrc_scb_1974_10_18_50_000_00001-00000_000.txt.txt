direction of Some Darlington,
lecturer in German, on Friday

."will present the German radio play
raeume (dreams), written by
post-WW ll writer Guenter Eich.

position and conversation class,
who are presenting the play as a

Transformation

Darlington feels that the lran-
sformation from radio to live
performance has been carried out
imaginatively by the use of visual
and auditory effects. She hopes
that the audience's attention will
be rivited on the slides While the
dialogue will inobtrusively, yet
vividly surround the listeners

A open reception will im-
mediately follow the play, which
will last an hour. To save time,
only four of the total five dreams

Mary Daly, professor of philosophy from
Boston College, launched the ship of radical
feminism into a new space time, where “the
sexual caste system” and “unequal access to
physical and spiritual wellrbeing” are left
behind.

Before taking oil, Daly elaborated on the
alienation of the female identity in a
patriarchial world She felt that society has
“particularized, trivialized, universalized
and spiritualized" the image of woman to
prevent active feminism from changing the

God the Father, believing that women cannot
benefit from such a male deity.

Language problems

Language problems were also a concern of
the 1974 Gates philosophy lecturer. Daly
preferred to use “rapism” in place of
“sexism,” and ”Covenant” to describe the
bonding process of sisterhood to promote
independent feelings of anger, pride, love and
Courage. She also saw the new radical
feminism Operating on the boundaries of
partiarchial institutions and universities, in a
space invisible to those outside the Women‘s
movement.

According to Daly, the “quantitive leap"
demands being a radical feminist since “just
a little bit feminist" only weakens the
movement while_ still receiving the lull
punishment from society. The leap also
requires a new definition of self, the cosmosi
and the ultimate reality, To this end, Daly
praised the historical independent qualities of
the witch who demonstrates the charac
teristics of the modern radical feminist: “one
who questions everything, who has her own
thoughts,”

nouctions

Audience reaiion to Ms. Daly ranged from
hostile to active support. The lnost negative
response occured during the question-and-
dnswer session when Daly said that she would
not accept any questions from men; a policy
that she has followed for two years,

Her powerful use of loaded words such as
“rape" and "Cxorcism‘Y to describe
traditional sacred institutions also made the
audience lecl uneasy about her insistant
claims of outrageous scxism But as the
purpose of the lecture was to “bring to the
campus the cry best of modern thought on

Misconceptions

Anne Abler, instructor in
sociology who helped organize the
seminar. feels that many people
have misconceptions about social
work. “When most people think of
social work," she stated. “they
think of the welfare worker." MS,
Abler explained that there are
numerous other occupations open
to students wanting to go into
social work.

Possible jobs include work with
retarded children, with family
health services, work in juvenile
courts, rehabilitation, community
organizations and even in various
businesses and industries. John

workers sit dismally by their desks

Death of
a Legend

by Ellen Wright

With a pack of wolves streaking
in pursuit, the greenhorn sled
driver urges his exhausted dogs on
in a Curdled frenzy. “Mush!” he
screams as the overloaded sled
careens through the Alaskan snow.
He turns, the cape of his city coat
flying, to pump out crazed rifle
shots. The sled topples, along with
the beautiful lady passenger who
barely makes it to her feet as she
flounders through the snow, The
wolves are closing in.

A likely scene? Considering only
the behavior of the wolves. no. This
incident from last weekend's
Cinema film. “The Call of the
Wild,” perpetuates legends about
\volves’ hostility to man.

Wolf expert David Mech writes
that there have been no sub-
stantiated cases of nonrabid
wolves attacking humans in North
America, “On the contrary, they
are extremely shy of man and
usually try to avoid him as much as
possible." (Maybe the movie
rescue by Charleton Heston was
unneeded.)
