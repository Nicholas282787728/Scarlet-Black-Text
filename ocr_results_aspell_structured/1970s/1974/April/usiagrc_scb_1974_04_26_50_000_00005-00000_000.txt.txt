WASHINGTON, D.C.—-Whenwe fir:-
st arrived upon the scene here in
our nation’s capital, the seat of all
power, the first stop on our ltlh—
erary was 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue. (For those of you who are not
cognizant maybe WH will spur a

few memories.) —

We nonchalantly
ﬂashed our press @E@§@Wlll

we Sign“ bl prospective

the award-winn-
ing, well-kknown—

journalist, John Wylie, and were
rudely shocked at our reception.
Not only was the guard at the gate
unimpressed by the fact that we
represented the second~oldest coll-
ege newspaper west of the Mississ-

ippi, but the occupant. in an un-
legget-like mumer refused us an
audience. Chagrined, our comefed

idealism was shattered. He done
stomped on our hearts and mashed
them suckers ﬂat.

Rebutfed. but undaunted. we found
the elusive {lo-series bus, caught
an N-A, and returned to what we
hoped would fill the void in our
hearts. We searched for a citadel
of intellectual security to replace
the womb-like atmosphere ofBur-

ling. We searchedhigh and low, mcs- ,

tly high, until wefound the American
University Library. It did not stack
up. Although it had wooden trestle
tables. the graffetti did not match
the standards set by the scholars
of Hurling. Not only that, but the
over-powering silence was not con-
ducive to conversation. Disheart-
ened and disoriented, we went in
search of the social life compar-
able to that which we had known
and loved so dearly in Grinnell.

Our first attempt was carressing
and conve rsing with the popular Dan-
ish vending machine. The meaning-
flll relationship was out of order.
The Grinnell Experience had failed
to sufficiently prepare us forthe au-
tomatic give and take involved in
such a situation.

Taking the campus by storm was
our next Lactic. However, this led
to an apocalyptic situation.We stuck
out like sore thumbs, i.e., we did-
n’t fit in. We talked about detassel-
ing corn, and they talked aboutLon-
guyland. We read Intellectual Di-
gest and they thumbed through Cos-
mopolitan. we chortled over the
SALE, while they shoveled the BS.
Sunk in GROUPTHINK, we tried
to muddle through.

Our encapsulated isolation was sh-
atte red when walking across campus
in our Grinne‘ll tvshirts, we were
accosted by screaming sirens for-
lornly chanting, “Seeburger,Fobes,
Scarzinzski, Douglas, SEEBURGER,
FOBES, SCARZINSKI, DOUGLAS,
etc.” We then realized our manifest
destiny was predetermined by the
acts of our predecessors on the
program. Everything suddenly be-
came crystal clear....,..the White
House reception, the vending ma-
chines. the library, and our sore
thumb.

From then on, it was down-hill.
Too long, we had searchedfor some-
thing that could only be found in
our past. We all took incompletes.

Jalte:Reprimands Theater Department

To the Editors:

The following is an noon letter to
the Executive Con

As a graduating theatre major who
has participated in the modern dance
group since my freshman year—,1
feel co‘niwlled to express my feel-
ings about the recent resignation of
Ms. Babe Voertma', l believe that
my perspective as both a theatre
maior and 3 dancer is unique and
might be a valuable contribution to
your consideration of the matter.
Before a fina‘ analysis canbemade,
the opinion of a person like‘myself
should be heard. To the best of my

MORE ‘

knowledge it has been ignored in all
of the recent generalizations about

"student. opinion" of Ms. Voert-
man’s work.

In the Week that l have known about
the resignation I have given the
issue a great deal oi thought. It
has forced me to look back on my
four years of close Contact with
Ms. VDertmall alll analyze my Work
with her. l came to Grinnell with
nine years of dance training be-
hind me and with serious thoughts
about pursuing dance in a profes-
sional capacity. lam leaving Grin-
nell with those same intentions and
believe that my participation in the
dance group has afforded me the
chance to improve and mature as a
dalcer. Ms. Voertmen had much
to offer me and I believe that She
has performed a vital function (or
the Grinnell community. Many peo—
ple come to Grinncll with previous
erpcrience in dance, others als-
cover it after they get here [see

the dance program under Ms. v0.

ful one {or both types u.r students.
If anything, it. is restricted by lim<
ited facilities 31d time for the
number of interested persons.

Willle the present controversv was
sparked by the theatre department’s

criticism of Ms. Voer'tman‘s duali-
fications as a director, I feel that
the department’s disapproval goes
beyond that point. It
that they_have expressed themselves
on a matter of taste, which is not
a valid basis upon which to eval-

2 professor, Another Dos -
might be a judgmcn: based
on ersonality differences.

Mn. Voertmnn has expressed the
fact that she has felt a tension or
barrier between herself and the
rest of the department over the past
few years. I am afraid that l must
sympathize with t‘iese feelings. it
seems that the “dancers“ and their
concert have long been looked upon
as a burden to the department on
I have felt that our behavior in the
theatre has been harshly or unduly
criticized. There was an extremely
uncomfortable air aboutour rehear-
sals in Roberts; i am afraid that
had any of us known aboutthe resig-
nation prior to our concert. all hell
would have broken loose.

In conclusion I must join others
who have reprimanded the theatre
faculty‘s handling of the matter,
whatever their motives might have
been. The gradual dissolution of
lines of communication has noplace
in a tomlnllnity like Grin'loll. Tile
excuse of ”distance" is a poor
one. When people in Mears find the
walk to the library too far,the cam—
pus is in sad straits. When thehall—
way between the dance and design
studios becomes impassable. a sit-
nation like the one we are nowiaced

with is created. For the past few
years dance has been ignored as an

integral aspect of the theatre, for
the wrong reasons, and to the det—

riment of Grinnell‘s theatre majors.
I would only hope that Ms. Voert-
man‘s services could be solicited
anew, though as things stand, the
chances are slim. Hopefully the
same mistakes will not he made
again.

Unfortunately l' ﬁnd Mr. Halver-
son‘s explanation to the theatre
majors inadequate. Ironically l was
informed of it through second-hand
sources as a copy of the statement
failed to appear in my mail box.
l call on you now as members ofthe
Executive Council to be alert to the
dangers of suchabreakdownin com—
munication because l do not think
that this is an isolated incident. Bit
it is sad that. it occured where it

oral communication as its frame-

Lee Morgan

Memorial Album

By Bruce Green, Music Editor

Being a devout reader of Down-
beat magazine for many months,
1 was very surprised to find that
Blue Note records had issued a
memorial album to lee Morgan,
since I had no idea that lee Morg~
an had paSsed on. How I missed
this 1 will never know, because lee
has been one of my favorite hopper
trumpeters for many years. But
that is immaterial to the record
at hand.

Whether or not lknew he was de-
ad, the issue of the memorial al—
bum indicates that such is the case.
My feelings for this man date back
to my senior year in high school,
when I first heard his horn with
the Dizzy Gillespie big band of the
late fifties.

l have most of the records he

speaks out

made with that band, a record he
made under his own name with
the personnel of the Jazz Mess-
engers, with Art Blakey, that he
was a member of for so long.
I have his Blue note double al-
bums also. and they are fantas-
th.

This Memorial Album CBN-LAZ24—
G) is one of the most fantastic sets
of recordings of Lee Morgan‘s en-
tire life, and my only regret is
that they waited this long to put it
out. It contains sides I have been
booking for for many many mon-
s.

”The Sidewinder." Dee's Classic
composition, is onthis record, along
with “C5012," “You Go To My

Head," “Just One of'fhoserhings,"

and several other pleces.The album
is a classic one; just the manand
his quinhet. No synthesizer, noover-
produced jazz essays, just a simple
trumpet man, backed up by the likes
of Billy Higgins, WayneSllorter, and
Pepper Adams.

Since they ale reissues, they date
from the early sixties on, and the
latest was recorded ln‘71,“Ceora"
is a lyrical, smooth piece by Mor-
gan, which indicates where Freddie
Hubbard came from stylistically.
Good solos, particularly by Morgan,
good backup by other instrumenta-
lists. and very good engineering.
Blue Notes engineering in this re-
cord should be commended greatly,
even aside from the merits of the
record itself.

There are three blues, of which
the “Sidewinder” is the toast. all by
Lee Moll-gen. Morgan may be re-
mombered more for his composit-
ional talents than for his horn pl-
aying, since it is beautiful in its
diversity. This performance of the
”Sidewinder" is marked by very
spirited solos by Morgan, Hanke
Mobley, and Hal Mabern, the pi-
anist. Biuy Higgins lays down a so-
lid drum backup, and comes in for
a solo himself, on occasion. The
other two Lee Morgan compost ons

Clarification

Last week’s editorial and editorial cartoon on the resignations
f the so—called “Wall Committee” appear to have been mlsm

erpreted in many quarters.

To set the record straight: we were not supporting either arty'
n the matter involving the Concerned Black Students (CBS an

J. Richard Woodworth and Anne R. Abler of the Department of ‘

ociology.

We will not support either party in this matte r. That dete rmina
ion is up to whatever body President Glenn leggett and the other
involved in investigating these charges feelis most appropriate
Our editorial was aimed at the entry of the AAUP into the cas
n such a way as to make members of the "Wall Committee’
eel that they could no longer continue. We intended no allegations
about any of the principals of the case inconnectlon wrth tha

entry.

We felt that the committee had a chance to separate fact fro
iction in this situation. We still feel that this or a similarbody—
operating free from outside pressure and publicity--provrdes th
best forum for handling these charges. ,

Our concern is not only for the futures of the individuals an

organizations involved in this case but also for the future 0
Grinnell College. Partisanship on our part, ill this type of sit

nation serves no useful purpose

 

are good, but not in the same vam
as either “Ceora” or “Sidewind-
er.”

One of the things that makes lee
Morgan the great trumpet man he
was, is that he was at home in any
musical environmentr Two tracks
on this album show it, as they are
both popular standards, rather than
the modern~sounding compositions
that he plays so well. “Just one
of Those .Things" is a Cole Por-
ter classic, and is performed beau-
tifully. “You Go To My Head." ano‘
ther ballad played in uptempo, is
not as good as the former, but that
is due, at least in part. to the fact
that it simply wasn’t the song the
other was,

All in all, this is a classic off-
ering of classic performances by
a classic trumpeter of the hard
bop school. RIP Lee, we'll miss

you.
