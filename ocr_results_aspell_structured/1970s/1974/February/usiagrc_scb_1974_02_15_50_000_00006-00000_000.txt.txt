PACE URGES
ZONING
COMMISSION

Members oi the Poweshiek Assocr
iation ior Conservation and Ecology
are urging Poweshiek County civic
leaders and municipal officials to
meet with the County Board of Sue
pe‘rvisors at 10:30am. Monday, Fe—
bruary 25 at the Courthouse in
Montezuma.

Lyn Cavanaugh, Chairwoman oi
the Environmental Committee at
the Grinnell League of Women Var
ters, said the group will urge the
Supervisors to appoint a County
Zoning Commission

Cavanaugh said Poweshiek County
is one of the few Iowa counties with
neither a County Zoning Commission
nor a county land use policy,

She added, “It has been ten years
since zoning was seriously consi-
dered for our county. Valuable ta—
rntlands and recreation areas have
been put to other use during this
time.”

Cavanaugh said the group lavors a
policy which would prohibit con
version or top gradelarmland or re
creational areas to other uses with,
out prior public hearings,

As,it presently stands, by the ins
heritance tax law upon the death ol
her spouse, a woman is often torc-
ed to payyheavy taxes on the proA
perty she inherits from her late
husband, In the opposite situation,
the husband is not required todoso.
This law hasalready causedtremenr
dous losses to a number of Iowan
women, especially the elderly, who
can be subjugated to government
coniiscation or property it unable
to bear this tax burden

By the lowa rape law, corrobora-
tion evidence must be so speciﬁc
as to include license plate numbers
and complete physical descriptions
oi alleged rapists (by the witness),
This is necessary even if medical
evidence can prove the victim was
iorcibly raped.»

Ryan discussed statistics on the
nature oi the 248 reported rapes
in 1973 (many are assumed unree
ported). in 85% oi the cases, iorce
was employed in 40%, there were
two or more oifenders and one vies
tim; 759/, were completely planned,
and 11% were at least partially
planned. Rape is also on the steady
increase, as opposed to other are
lmes Such as robbery and theft,
The Women’s Caucus believes that
ii rape was raised to the status at a
convictionable crime, by abolishing
the corroboration requirement, its
incidence would drop sharply

at the Grinnell meeting, one as a

Presently, in Grinnell HighScbool,
sex discrimination Still ﬂourishes,
First oi all, girls are only allowed
to enroll in home economics cu“,
rses while boys can only take shop.
Even at their own requests, girls
have been denied the privilege oi
partaking in shop classes.

Secondly, only males are teaching
social studies at Grinnell High Sch»
OOl, Due to the glut on the market
of social studies instructors,a pre—
requisite ior a person who wishes
to be hired in that field is that he
must also be an athletic coach,
Until last year, only men’s extrar
mural sports existed in the Grins
nell public schools.

Among other allegations that the
Grinnell Women's Political Caucus
plans to investigate are possible
discriminatory hiring and promur
tlon practices at the General Teler
phone Company, a mayor employer
in the community.

The constituents oi the meeting
included mostly teachers and pro»
tessors’ wives, although some
homemakers, college-students and
two busmesswomen were present.

Leaders oi the caucus hoped that
as a result oi the group's actiVi‘
ties, people in the town would be
come “more aware" oi problems
faced by women in Grinnell, in 107
wa, and in the worldsat—lhrge.

Spock: Radical

by Douglas Halsey

Dr. Benjamin Spock addressed an
overflow audience at TheUniversity
of town campus last week, and cal-
led ior the need for radical poll-
tics in future dealings with the
American government ironically,
Spock was sponsored by the Joint
Committee on Amnesty,

When Spock was originally app-
roached to speak on amnesty, he
declined, saying that he didn’t feel
he was suiiiciently informed on the
subiect to speak honestly

lnstead, Bob Mayer, co-ordlnator
tor the Plains States bureau of the
War Resisters League was inclu»

Politics Needed

The plattorm oi the People's Par-
ty, Spock stated, generally iollowed
these guidelines.

1, Withdrawal oi all American
lorces trom ioreign soil.

2 Close all tax loopholes.

a, Abolish poverty and provide
$6,500 minimum tor a family or 4
with the money saved in parts 1

ded in the evenings program toadd» -

ress the subiect oi amnesty dirEr
ctly. Mayer is a CO turned drnit
resister and counselor and works
out at Kansas City.

Spock gave a briei background oi
his college liie, interjecting stories
01 his very conservative initiation
into politic “It wasn't until I
transierred, n the middle oi med
ical school, to Columbia...that as
{or as I know, i ever talked to a
Democrat, let alone a Socialist!"

Spock described his involvement
in the Peace movement as a “step-
by—step development” whiciibecame
intensive alter Lyndon Johnson be»
came President. Johnson had asked
him to speak on his behali during
the campaign and Spock being ita-
ttered accepted Alter all, he said,
next to Goldwater, Johnson was a
peace candidate advocating no es-
calation, no bombing and no troop
involvements.

Upon his election, Johnson Called
Spock into his new otiice and said,
“Dr Spock, l hopel prove worthy
oi your trust.“ it was but three
months after this that Johnson Sent
American troops into South Viet~
nam Spock recalled,

in the summer oi 1967 Spock join»
ed in the “Call to Resist Illegal
Authority.” a petition distributed
and signed throughout many of this
country’s universities and colleges,
and took a moral stand in tavor oi
amnesty. This move began his deep
involvement in the anti-war move
ment

Spock took the opportunity to add-
ress and give his opinions on sev-
eral issues in America's involve-
ment in lndochlna and the nation
in general. He called the Tonkin
Guli incident, which Johnson pro-
iessed to be provoked by North
Vietnam, ”...one oi the dirtiest
irauds ever played on the Ameri—
can people” and cited the Ameri»
can military as being the real an-
tagonist

Spock then turned to politics, and
stated outright that the extreme

‘lack oi adequate medical care in

this country showed that the Fed
eral government wasn't seriously
interested in the weliare at its peOr
pie, This fact and the growing gen-
eral discontent among youngAmerl—
cans with their government's po
cies prompted the meeting of rad-
ical and activist groups in 1971 and
the iormalion oi the People’s Par-
ty, to encourage radical political
activity. The Party nominatedSpock
to run as their candidate ior PreSr
ident in 1972

9, Have school boards made up oi

the college level, of Students and
laculty.

Spock then turned the podium over
the Robert Mayer. Mayer, a quiet,
bearded, young man, spoke directly
on amnesty, He related hisperscnal
experiences oi talking withaMarine
veteran and then later picking up a
hitchhiker who turned out to be a
drait evader. He was traveling, as
apparently all resistersandevaders
must, staying nolongerthanamonth
or so in any one place.

“Many,” said Mayer, "just get
tired of living in a constant state
of fear, and eventually turn them-
selves in'," through such organiza-
tions as SAFE Return. By doing
this they only avoid a prison senr
tence. Desertersturningthemselves
in still receive a dishonorable dis-
charge.

Mayer, like Spock concluded on an
appeal/tor direct action to stop US.
involvement in Southeast Asia, and
a call for universal, unconditional
amnesty,
