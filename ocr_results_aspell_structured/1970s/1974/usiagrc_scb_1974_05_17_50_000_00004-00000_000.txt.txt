Kellar, who fought and scrambled
back after losing the first set to
take command by 2-6, as, 7-5;
and Paul Van Scliilfgaarde, who de-
spite a problem shoulder “aoed”
his man 6-4, 6-3.

Tuesday foul weather freeoed out
all play- off action scheduledforear-
ly in the week pushing back the
essential North Campus elimination
derby and the South Campus penn-
ant tilt.

Featured in the South will be the
much anticipated Read-Off Campus
battle. The winner of that will get
the privilege of facing the North
run-off victor; either Gates-Lan-

gan, Norris, Younkers, or the Pr-
ofs.

Casey has stated that he would
like to get the divisional play-offs ‘
taken care of at least by tomor—
row, allowing ample time for the
final inter-division tilt to decide
the Grinnell College champion.

Read all about it in the August 23
issue of the 3&5 (it’Ll be a while).

Flush: It’s G/l, Younk

by Dave Calvert
Gates- Langan and Younkers came
up with impressive North Campus
run— —of{ wins in late lM softball
action Wednesday, putting them in
the North Campus final, Also com-

pleted yesterday was the southern:

divisional playoff, featuring lieavily
favored on Campus and tightly knit
Read.

Mac Field was the scene of the
Gates/Langan » Norris tangle, a
game won handily by G/L 5-0. It
was the first shutout in recent IM
history, and featured a spell-bind-

ing performance by ace hurler Rick
Nightingale. (5 l). The crafty vet»
eran allowed but four hits in walk-
ing none. No slouch with the hat,
the varsity wrestler clubbed aba-
ses loaded second inning single for
the winning margin.

Out on the soccer field things went
smoothly for Younkers, as they
knocked the Profs around for a 13—
3 “10 run rule” decision. Senior
moundman Rick Faust stifled the
big Prof sticks and the outcome
was evident early.

Tennis Tourney Drags On

The elimination process continued
this week in the Grinnell Mixed
Tennis Tourney as the second round
drew to a close.

John Pfitsch and Mary Damngaard
found the going easyasthey defeated
Ellen Yacknin and Wayne Moyer,
6-2, 6-0. Also scoring a decisive
victory were Glenn Leggett and
Cathy Lee over Bob Donelan and
Tracy l-luling, 6-1, 6-1.

Allen Jessen and Carol Braezael

matches when they trounced Tom
Safley and Michele Rothenberg, 6-1,

Walker and Carol Nielsen got into
play only to be overcome by Linda
Peden and Kent Christian, 6-4, 6-1.
Victor Verrette and Chris Ryan

Patty Jassak, 3—2, 5-3.

Craig Zippe and Susan Price con—
tinued their winning streak by eli-
minating John Haigh and Sara Keene
in a close match, 7-5, 6- Pat

CORRECTION

All kinds of apologies to Syb
George and Patty Jassak, whom
we have wrongedl The correct
outcome of their mixed doub-
les tennis match last week with
Hal Goodman and Ellen Grady
was 10- 2 pro set victoryiorthe
George/Jassak tandem.

Brenner and James Fudge also squ-
eaked by their opponents, Jeff Reed
and Jen Jenkins, 6-4, 7-5.

Third round matches, the quarter-
finals, are to be played by Wed-
nesday, May 15. However, as oflate
Wednesday afternoon, none of the
matches had been played/The semi-
final round technically should be
completed by May 17, but this now
appears unlikely. The winners ofthe
tournament will be announced in
the August 23 edition of the 3&5.
