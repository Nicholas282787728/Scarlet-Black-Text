HineranlL Images

by Douglas Halsey

What Brian Harris has tried to
do in his photographic exhibit at
East Street Gallery is portray a
poem through photographs.

“The show is really a poem,”
says Henry Wilhelm of ESG," to
be taken as a whole, with Visual
images instead oi words."

Harris, an assistant proiessor oi
German. said he had been taking
pictures, seriously, ior about 2
years. Intrigued by the immense
power oi non-verbal communicar
tian. and the relations of verbal

visual imagery, he concentrated on
photography, as he says. “tried to
translate word imagery in poetry
into visual imagery."

But Har‘ris readily admits that he
is not entirely concerned with
such loity objectives. “There is a
certain bitterness in my photogra-
phy," he remarks. l-larris also
admits that he is. perhaps subcon-
sciously, trying to give his interp-
retation oi America. So are a lot
oi photographers. But his pictures
are marked by a clean, straight

tablished his exhibit to reveal his
personal changes. as well as put
up a show with some audience
appeal.

“Itinerant Imageshy Brian Hare
ris" consists'oi 22 photographs.
Harris chose the title ”itinerant"
because he wanted to reveal to
the observer the fact of his
personal changes, as‘well as re
vealing that the photographs evol-
ve from an external to an internal
sphere.

I however, did not find this the
case. To the contrary, to me the
sequence was the opposite, evolv-
ing from an internal to an extern—
al sphere.

f rward a preach Harris has es’ The show begins with several
““ ' '- ' ’ images oi old abandoned houses,
internal pictures which gradually
reveal glimpses oi iields through
open windows. There is a sense oi
space in this series, revealing the
outside world from an internal
angle, The completion oi this briei
series is an external photograph oi
the outside oi a house.
Harris then juxtaposes a series
oi human pictures. some quite
sensitive. with the inanimate
houses. The human images quickly
become mirror images. Harris is
concerned with trying to portray a
sense oi being in two places at
once. Thereiore, a transition is
created by Harris revealing his‘ ff , ”ontolonin
own image in some of the mirror- / “(WWII/iii ill
ed images. The mirrors evolve ””M/IIIV/Y/mlllt “intro“
into a briei series oi purely // - , ‘ = ‘ i
geometric photographs. the bold MlW/f/ﬂ/l/{ﬂlmlm ll
patterns oi piping and coiled hose.
Next is a picture which is, to me,
a cacophoney oi shapes and pat
terns, with a bold .. ‘74 RULES"
on a brick wall and a disturbing
hand in one corner oi the print.
The show orieily returns to more
mirror images, concluding with a
print revealing the humanness
that Harris is concerned with, a
print showing a shadowy iigure
“escaping" irom the mirror.
East Street Gallery is well worth
visiting anytime, and is particu-
larly intriguing now, because oi
Harris's exhibit. The Gallery is
located at 723 State Street lacross
irom the Grinnell railroad depot)
and is open from 2-8 PM daily.
Harris'show runs through April 30.
