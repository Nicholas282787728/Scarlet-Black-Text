c KDIC Remodels, Boosts Schedule

by Sherman Boone

Hark! What's tha’t new soundcoming
across the airways? Why it’s KDIC,
of course, and it’s a WholenewKDIC
for this semester Not only have
noticeable physical modificationshit
the station, but a variety olprogram
changes will also be poppingupdur-
ing the course of the nextiewweeks.

by just walking into station head-
quarters high above Darhy Gyme
nasinm one can readily tell that
profound changes have already been
made. in addition to the new con,
trol board added late lastyear,there
is a new record library (housing
close to 3,000 albums) and an extra
tape library. “Studio B“ has been
transformed into aConferenceRoom
for “round-lame” discussions.
There has even been a new AR
turntable and headphone set plac—
ed in the record library to enable

RATIONING

disc jockeys to preview new ree
leases, thus keeping all records

on the premises.

Program and Music Director Fre
ank Stoler notes that the addition
of the auditioning equipment will
help station personnel keep abreast
of new acts and new artists who
might not otherwise receiveairplay.
“We hope to make a wider variety
of music available to the campus,"
said Stoler.

The most noticeable change, how»
.ever, is the enlarged news’ room .
headed by News Director Warren
Smith . which will be open through-
out broadcasting hours lor mem-
bers oi the college community to
get immediate news reports from
the AP wire, Also, it is intended
that summaries of wire reports
will be placed on a bulletin in the
Forum for those "Forum Rats"

Student Needs‘ Overlooked

by John Wylie

More than 2 million American
college students may be left with
out gasoline if the Federal Gasoe
line Rationing Contingency Plan is
implemented as it is currently out-
lined.

Any student who attends school
outside of his home state would
either be forced to travel home to
pick up his rationing coupons or
would be left without gasoline.

Current contingency plans, issued
by the Federal Energy Office Jan»
nary 16, state, “Individual drivers
would go to distribution centers to
pick up cunpous...Conpons must be
picked up in the same state inwhich
the driver's license and authorizae
tion card were issued.

Carolyn Porter, a spokesperson
for the Region VI Federal Energy
Office in Kansas City said that the
present regulations apparently
would deny gasoline to students
attending school away from their
home state,

She added that an updated con-
tingency plan would be issued by
the national Federal Energy Office
shortly, but that the problem which
would face some college students
had not been raised to date.

Arthur Robdell, Executive Direc-
tor of the National Student Lobby
in Washington, is trying to arrange
a meeting with Federal Energy Di-
rector William Simon to discuss
the effects of rising fuel costs on

commuting college students
Robdell and Simon’s aides arealso
discussing other effects of the fuel
crisis on students, includinglengthy
winter vacations and increased pri~
CBS for books.
lows Studean '
More than 50,000 Iowans would be
effected by the rationing problem,
according to the most recent fig-

ures compiled by the united States '

Office of Education. .
‘ or these, about 29,000 are nut-of»
state students who attend school in
lcwa, and about 22,000 are Iowans
who leave the State for college.

Nationwide, 2.35 million students
leave their home states to pursue
college degrees. According to law.
Beets, Region VI Director of High-
er Education in the Office ofEduca—
tion. almost one out of every three
college students enrolled today at—
tend school outsidetheir home state.

Set Aside

Current rationing contingency
plans would set aside five per cent
oi each state's total gasoline allo»
cation in a special pool, to be
used in allocating hardship cases.
However, there are no provisions
in the hardship regulations now en-
visioned which would cover outeof-
state college students.

1N GRINNELL, the Office of Stu»
dent Affairs estimates that 1100 of
Grinnell‘s 1200 students come from
outside Iowa. Of these, about 100
currently have cars on campus.

who never have time to listen to
the radio.

The improvements were made p0.
ssible by a $500 grant irom the
College arrangedby PresidentGlenn
Leggett.

Another $500 donation, tromTrus-
tee Walter straley. paid accumulat-
ed debts stemming from the sta-
tion’s Associated Press news ser»
vice.

Program changes will also bequite
apparent when KDIC resumes nor
mal broadcasting hours this semes»
ter. In addition to increased air
time for jazz and classical music,
there will be quite a large number
of “specials” to be broadcast. For
instance, there will be a l4vweek
BBC series on China and a ten—
week radio drama entitled “Moon
Over Morocco,” produced by the
253 (”Zero Bull Shit”) Media, With
sound effects imported all the way
from Morocco! Other more inforr
mative programs include the Latin
American Press Review, "In Black
America,” “Dateline: Grinnell"
(with John Wylie), the ISPlRG re—
Port, “The Rest of the News" (a
Monday night special put together
by former students in the lthica,
N.Y. area concerning topics that
don’t always get their fair share
oi reporting), and a number of lece
tures broadcast from the Univer-
sity of Texas at Austin. Tentatively
planned are old radio shows such
as ”The Lone Ranger" and "The
Green Hornet" to be broadcast at
half past twelve each morning.

The most fundamental change at
KDlC, however, is not one of equi e
ment or setvup; it is one of atti-
tudes. Stoler and Station Manager
Dale Scherler readily agree that
there will he a “new" KDlC this
semester. The station intends to
open its facilities to enable active
and open participation by all meme
bers of the Grinnell College Come
munityi It is their wish to “open
the airways” to serve KDIC'S lis~
tening audience with more than just
music.

FDA: Two Products Could Kill

' Special to the Starlzl ind Black

WHITE PLAINS, NY—-Nada Man—
gialetti (‘72) of the Westchester,
Putnam, and Dutchess Counties Bet-
ter Business Bureau Wednesday an—
nounced a warning issued bythe Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) ab-
out two health food products which
contain dangerous levels of hydro-
gen cyanide,

The products, Aprihernand Bee—
Seventeen, are sold through health
food stores. FDA scientists es—
timate that 20 Apriken capsules

could kill a college»age adult, and
that five Aprikern capsules or two
packets of BeerSeventeen could be
fatal to a child.

Mangialetti told the Scarlet and
Black, in a written statement, ”If
anyone has bought either of these
products, destroy them immed-
iately.”

The products are manufactured by
General Research Laboratories of
California, which has not recalled
them from the market. Mangialetti

Bus line Schedule Changed

by Jody Schwartz

Some things are speeding up in-
stead of slowing down as a result
of the new national speed limit of
55 m.p.h,, as noted by Lawrence
“Bo" batiey, local Greyhoundagent
and operator or Battey Texaco at
Sixth and West.

Despite confusions with new sche-
dules. Battey has noted a pickup in
the Greyhound Bus service, attrie
buted to uncertain plane schedules
and potential dry gasoline pumps.

The new schedule reﬂects thetime
losses created by the slower speed
limit, increasing some out-of-state
layovers. Extended layovers espece
ially affect the southehounddestina-
tions on the Jefferson Lines, while
the northbound routes remain base
ically the same. Battey recommends
that people plan trips ahead of time
to assure making difficult connec-
tions.

The new schedule:

Westbound
Leave Grinnell 815 a.m., arrive
Des Moines 9:30 am.

Leave Grinnell 12:50 p.n'l., arrive
Des Moines 2:15 pm.
Leave Grinnell 6:55pm., arrive Des'
Moines 8:05 pm.

Eastbound
Leave Grinnell 10:20 a.mi, arrive
Iowa City 12:20 pm.
Leave Grinnell 5:05 pm, arrive

plans to initiate legal action to
prevent further shipments of the
two products.

She urged anyone knowing of st-
ores still selling either of the pro-
ducts to telephone the FDA otfice
