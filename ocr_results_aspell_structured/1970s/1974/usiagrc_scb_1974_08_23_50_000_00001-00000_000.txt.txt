B&G strike

remains unsettled ‘39-»

Members of the Building and
Grounds labor force walked off
their jobs July 25 after negotiations
in the seventh termal negotiating
session since May 21 proved un-
successful.

Representatives oi the College
have been in almost constant in
formal contact with the
representatives of Teamsters
Local No. 90 since May. but no
agreement has been reached up to
Ihis date.

All of the BkG labor force is on
strike. although only 63 workers
are union members. The other 15
employees are respecting the
picket lines. Management, which is
non-union. has continued to work
since the walkout,

Pay raises and Vacation time
have emerged as the two major
issues in the continuing dispute.
The College has increased its
original oiiers lor the proposed
tweyear contract to a s 24 per hour
acrosstlie-board increase in pay
for the first year of the contract.

The second year oi the contract
permits a zz-cent per hour across-
thehoard increase in pay, plus an
additional holiday with pay and all
additional week of paid vacation
ior employees with iiiteen years of
service. The current Contract
permits an employee to take six
paid holidays at year and a two-
week paid vacation.

Delays

Waldo Walker, executive vice
president and dean of the college.
ieels that a major cause oi the
delay in settling a new contract
was the inability of the local
bargaining unit to bring their
demands into narrower issues, He
stated that irequent new demands
and split issues Within the union
were the main drawbacks which
prevented an early settlement.

Walker is now hopeful that the
negotiations will proceed swirtly
now that the union demands are
wellri‘ocused. He said that the
College needs the services of the
physical plant labor iorce to run
efficiently, and that the employees
need their salaries. Walker ex
plained that the strike pay which
the workers are receiving does not
nearly compensate for the wages
which have been lost in the month-
old walkout.

In defending the College’s
position at the bargaining table,
Walker emphasized that wage
increases were “virtually identical
to the settlement made by Drake
University with their physical
plant labor force.” The 8 per cent
salary raise also “compares quite
favorably with the average 6,6 per
cent aise which the faculty and
administrative stall received,”

been harassment of management

ditioning lines, nails in service
drives glue and putty in locks and
unidentified callers have all been
officially presented to the union
representative.

Union members feel that the
College has unfairly used other
union and nonrunion labor to
complete tasks normally carried
out by the striking BSzG workers.
Walker responded that the College
has acted legally within the Fair
Labor Practices act which defines
who may and may not work when a
union is on strike.

Effects

Although quite a lot of scheduled
work was finished before the
strike, several items were not
completed during the remaining
days of summer. Between 40-50
rooms need plastering, but the
plasterers are honoring the picket
lines and will not cross them while
3&6 is on strike.

The new storm Sashes for Car-
negie are only two-thirds com-
pleted, and renovations in Darby
tor the new computer center and in
the science building for the Rush
medical program also remain
incomplete, Saga Food service has
been hampered by truckers who
will not cross picket lines and
deliver foodstuffs. All of the lure
niture in the collegeowned off
campus housing was moved in by
administrative personnel, who
have also had to do their own office
clean-up.
