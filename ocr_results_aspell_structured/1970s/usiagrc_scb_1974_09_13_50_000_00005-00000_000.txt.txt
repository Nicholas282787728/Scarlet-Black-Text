Strikers si’r & kni’r

Vida eroteheted green, gold, and
orange yarn into an armchair
cover, and lda clicked knitting
needles bound in burgundy yarn,
making a sweater. Seated in lawn
chairs, they Chattedand watched
trattic as they began the second
hour of their afternoon.

Now they are strikers, but
normally Mrs, Vida Allen is a maid
on north campus and Mrs. Ida
Weaver is a telephone operator.
Five days a week and six hours a
day they sit, watch, and wait for
the end,

Mrs. and Allen and Mrs, Weaver,
both farmers’ wives who live in the
country, have the 12 p.m. to 6 pm.
shift for traveling convenience
The male strikers stand the night
and weekend shifts, while the
women hold the fort during the
daylight hours. As long as one
person remains, the other may go
to get a candy bar or an ice cream
cone, so that their six hours aren’t
completely motionless imr
prisonment in their strike spot.
Boredom is prevented by changing
locations and Sitting companions.
This was the first time Vida and
ida had been together in a week
which gives them more to visit
about.

For six hours what is there to do
besides visit with each other,
exchanging recipes, and sew'.’
Talking to students passing by is
the highlight of their shift. Students
are the recurring topic of con-
versation whether it is visiting with
them or inquring how conditions
are in the dormitory or asking it
that student lived in Clark
basement and isn’t that one a
senior. That's why Cowles is one of
their favorite locations because
they can watch the teams practice
and converse with the numerous
students frequently crossing their
path.

The only hint of discontent with
their striking duties was as lda put
it, “there's a surplus oi noise and
time," at their location in front of
the Fine Arts building with trucks

Iowa in review

by John M. Wylie ll
News Director. KDlC-FM

Grinnell's little 13-man police
iorce has its own detective squadi
perhaps the smallest law enr
torcement unit in the state to have
a full-time detective,

police Chiet Bill peters said he
had “been toying with the idea tor
some time" beiore he appointed
Sgt. James Ahrens to the newly-
created post of detective sergeant
last year.

In June, Ahreiis resigned his
Grinnell police commission to
become deputy sheriir of
Poweshiek County. But the
detective iorce lives on, with Det.
Sgt. Darrell Lamb as the fullrtime
investigator.

Peters said he hasn't noticed any
decrease in the crime rate since
Grinnell’s onerman detective
squad was inaugurated But the
case load in District Court has
risen dramatically.

“l've never seen so many cases
in District Court. That’s because
we're breaking cases now that
would have gone unsolved before,”
Peters explained.

There's no Cannon-Kojack-
Tcnefly razzle dazzle involved. just
legwork and know how.

Peters said the biggest ad
vantage or having a lull-time ins
vestigator is the increased
flexibility it gives his department
in dealing with major crime.

He cited the recent savage at-
tack on tavern operator Roy
Johnson as one example.

iohnsor was severely beaten and
relieved oi his billfold while he was
closing Duffy’s Tavern in down
town Grinnell. There were iew
physical clues.

A team from the Iowa Bureau of
Criminal Investigation (BCI) was
called in to assist Grinnell police.
Lamb was able to devote as much
time as necessary to coordinating
eitorts in the case. Peters said.

“That’s the big advantage. The
old way, I'd be doing that kind oi
thing~until i got snowed under
with paperwork. This way,
someones available to do the job,"
Peters said.

Grinnell’s onerman detective
force is unique, Peters said, He
noted that Newton, with a 26 Dr 27-
man department, has no detective.

Peters said he will be better able
to assess the eitectiveness or
Grinnell's detective program at
the end at the year, when all the
iigures are drawn together tor the
department‘s annual report

But, ior now, he is pleased,

Politicians throughout the state
are making charges and counr
tercharges about the issues, But,
nobody has spotted the real issue
yet: waste.

For example: Jim Leach
suggested restrained iederal
spending. He issued a press release
about it. Ed Mezvinsky fired back
wi another press release con
taining his ideas on inﬂation.

, . Leach came back with another

missive, praising Mezviiisky’s
”Conversion" and inviting the
freshman Congressman to vote tor
him in November.

We can assume that war will go

lt’s wasteiui, but i suppose
