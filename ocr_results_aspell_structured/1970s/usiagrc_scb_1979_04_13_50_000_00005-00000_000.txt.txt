Control: exercising restraint

The art of control is a tascinating
and extremely poweriul art. We
learn how to control very early in
life: in fact, those who learn to
master the art gain respect and
admiration from their peers.
Controllers quickly become
leaders while the controlled are
easily manipulated. For the most
part, our society considers the
ability to control a positive
characteristic. Controllers are
strong, assertive, and sure oi
themselves. They are natural born
leaders. Or so it would seem

Control is manifested in various
ways, even here at Grinnell. Men
control women, woan control
men. friends control friends,
teachels control students, Students
control each other, the list is as
long as the number of possible
Combinations of human inter-
action. Unfortunately, many of us
fail to realize that control can be.
and often times is, very destruc»
tive.

TAKE FOR EXAMPLE a
hypothetical school boy named
Johnny who happens to be very
assertive. When little Johnny first
realized he Could control his fellow
playmates, undoubtedly he ex-
perieneed a sense oi superiority
Perhaps his teachers even praised
him for taking the initiative. More
importantly, his playmates
probably succumbed to his
directions rather than take the risk
of interjecting. Airaid they may
lose Johnny’s friendship, the other
students iollowed and placated.

A couple of years ago I observed
a class at one of the elementary
schools here and discovered a case
similar to the hypothetical
situation above. A bright, young,
attractive Asian ,student had
recently moved to the area. At first
she spoke no English. but she
quickly learned to communicate

 

with her American counterparts. I
was amazed at the rate at which
she acquired the language. lThis
simply affirmed the phenomenon
that generally children are better
able to adapt to a new area and
acquire a new language thaii are
adults.)

AT ANY RATE, the other
students were in awe of the little
girl. and they tended to “ooh" and
”ahh" over her Everyone wanted
ll) be her best friend. They all

classes are small enough so that
the students can, if the spirit so
moves them. participate in a lively
discussion (as long as it's not
Monday morning or Friday af-
ternoon or there’s no. warm
weather). Many students ieel they
could contribute a great deal to the
class. but often hesitate to do in
because of a dominant few who
manage to alwavs control the
class. Those dominant few will go
on to make the better grades and

Controllers become leaders and the

controlled are easily manipulated

wanted to play Wlth her during
recess I must admit, I was also
tempted to “play favorites" with
her simply because she was so
beautitully unique

inevitably the situation grew out
of control. The blame could not be
placed totally on the little girl, for
all were at fault; but nevertheless.
she learned to use her power and
influence in a very controlling and
destructive fashion. She would
have the other boys and girls doing
things to satist her seliish whims.
of course. the others thought that
this would win the little girls love
and affection. As might be ex»
pected. it did not,

THE POINT TIIAT l am trying
to make is not that control is a bad
concept, To the contrary. being
able to take control of a situation is
an admirable accomplishment, To
lead a discussion group or make an
ingenious suggestion or organize a
demonstration are all ways oi
taking control, being a leader. Yet.
when we take it to the extremes,
control becomes harmful.

the raw end of the deal.

or COURSE, lain exaggerating
the issue somewhat QUlet people
also make good grades and become
successful The point IS that the
dominate controllers are oiten
inconsiderate and sell-centered
l'm not trying to put anyone down
because. Lord knows, I talk too
much Sometimes. But there is
much to be learned irom the silent
majority. As a matter oi tact, they
probably know a great deal more
than most oi us since they have
learned to listen well to others.

As far as personal relationships
are concerned, it is tar better not to
try and control each other. Neither
the controller nor the controllee
can beneiit irom such a

_relationship. for they each lose

sight of themselves. The con-
troller begins to think he or she Is
never wrong and the contr‘ollee
begins to think he or she is never
right. Those who try to dominate a
relationship fall to realize that by
suppressing the thoughts of the
other. they are suppressing a
unique identity.

For the lime that we are here, we
should learn all that we can. We
should try to get the most out of
liberal arts education, considering
how much we had to pay ior it. We
should learn to be self~confident
and grave, But we should also
learn to be considerate and

Word has gotten back to lbe'desk
that the views oi one particular
albeit infrequent columnist are
somewhat jaded, The term having
been left undefined, the Columnist
chooses to interpret the statement
in the least pejorative tashion
allowable within the graces of a
clear Conscience.

However,lhis does not mean that
the implications oi such a critique
go unfelt at home. Quite to the
contrary, one finds that in such
Situations itis often best to swing to
the opposite side of the pendulum
to jar one's complacency,

FOR THIS REASON an entirely
new and previously untapped
populace has been sought for
opinion polling in the new,and now
nevereendingsearch this columnist
has undertaken,

The quest tor. a fresh view oi
Grinnell College and its relative
existence in the world led me to the
doors of a somewhat less liberally
oriented academic Institution for
five to twelve-yearrolds, located
south of town.

The following, then, is all the
information on the college and its
occupants i could gather irom the
six to eight-year-olds.

“l'tilililtifiE STUDENTS are big.
They like to jog and are usually
dressed to jog. They go to the donut
shop in the middle or tne nignt.
They play football, shoot hoops and
play frisbee in the park sometimes.
They also play this on the Campus
but we never go there,

You go to college to study about

“TO GET lNTo college you have
to get past tenth grade, after that it
is also ox to get married. it you’ve
got any money that's your own
they expect you lo give it to them
You also have to know how to cook.
t’l‘his last comment is perhaps an
insightful peek at the real con-
lroversy surrounding the

“College is hard,‘)ut if you listen

spank you back or break your neck

what options are left» to the
frustrated dean of students. “Tell

WHAT CAN YOU get With

At this juncture we humbly
return to our roots in reality, where
surprisingly enough. much of the
above is confirmed In official print,
I i-eicr the reader to page 40 hi the
197379 Academ't‘ Catalogue of
Grinnell College, Where it is
written:
