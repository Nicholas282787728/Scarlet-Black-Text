The Pine at the Edge o! the Field

The golden crow:
the yawn of its wakefulness"
ﬂight of the scotch pine.

wheeling over the pine
‘in the sunrise, the tar caw
of a last crow.

Smell of prairie pine--
in the wind an existence
I had lorgotten.

woven with Autumn snow,’
the bird’s nest in the scotch pine, held
to the light ot moon.

In these immature . ,
pine cones, winged seeds awaiting

a return to dark birth
a

The shortest oi trunks;
branches winding like mountain creeks;
useless?--pine growing.
at

Longrt‘lrawn train whistle;
snow lalls soitly on evergreen--
letting my eyes rest.
,

Needles stiii' with ice
sway as one in the blizzard--
stone wstness of trunk.

in this single pine,
snow deepened mountain torest;
clouds shroud luminous.
a

now free the roseate
cloud, responding; as free as
the scotch pine, rooted.
s

This lone branch, drooping
over the horizon with the
sun in its setting.
:
These brie! winter days
clouds vanish with the setting sun:
so clear now scotch pine.
e
Tonight, a tailing star?
Pine’s still branches bright against
the silence of black.

The sameness 0f the All
Is getting me down.

The changes are many,
But seem far between...
And I'm bored,

And wanting to leave

it behind.

She said yesterday
She’d run away toO---
That we’d go somewhere,
Only to return

later, or maybe never.
Only to see

some new laces,

some new countryside.
And maybe a forest or two,

So today we’re escaping
Tomorrow we’ll return
To Reality and Here,
And doing what we must.
Still don’t know what
THE MUST is.

Still searching for it,..
Still running from it,
And towards it,

at the same time...

Or maybe just around it.

Been running around it
Alot lately...

Maybe that’s the sameness
in itself.

Maybe the Change
is a need to settle down.

But that’s too restless.

Plaid

We are plaid,
woven by rate
you go west
I north,
and on occasion
we intersect
and blend
you are red
I am blue
but in our short moments together
we are vehement purple.

Returning

Lookv

look to the still branch.
See the way it bends near to
the river Suiattle, each leaf fixed
in the void, each leaf the edge
of the void: a bird in motionless ﬂight
caught against the speeding beyond
oi the river that gushes with
a darker glacial strain 0! winter Wasted
Still“

where each point expands, .
blood bursts the membranous wall, spewing
into the river, becoming the river
tree oi mending roots->1
am no more than eyes lilled
with maggots and earth-revolving worms;
the spade plunges into the sod
and hands pluck my eyes from a split
head and teed them to the tree fish,

upon reading ITALLA, MAGISTRA ARTIUM Ind remembering mark

the dint at a smile, ah, the hint of warmth;
reaching to touch, to be touched, to be held

(behold! the) moon: 3 jest, a wist-
inl smile oi the day must passed by

the past, eye see (remember) a distant thought:
a name, a hand, a look, the eyes (deep and brown),

the smile...the name is so very far away,
mark, i think, perhaps, no matter...still

i hold close to me the warmth ot that time:
the hand. the smile, touching, holding, an,

he weakens me with the strength ol many lonely
knights, with the love oi many fair maidens,

the soldiery ol his eyes, the armory of this
love, holding me. convincing me, coercing me

i want...i want...i want to hold, i want to
hold onto...something...someone;

searching for
the past leads (leaves) me lost (or the wont

and want of the real; instead i seek the realm
oi moon; (behold! the) moon: wistful, wanting;
