Arts director
answers Irwin’s letter

To the Edito n responding to Pat
Irwin’s cr ism of I-Iancher
Auditorium (12-10-76. I). 4) in the
matter of the Modern Jazz Quartet,
I hope to be honest and objective—
and friendly. Among all the
colleges and universities in Iowa,
The University of Iowa and
Grinnell College have particular
bonds of interest and friendship.
Those bonds are far more im-
portant to the U of 1 than readers
light infer from Pat Irwin's letter.
\ Hancher Auditorium’s position
toward an MJQ concert at Grinnell
was not intended as a slap at
drinnell College, nor at Grinnell's
students. It was a position taken in
fairness to the Auditorium’s own
student patrons at the U of I.
Having subscribed, beginning last
April, for a series of 1976-77 events
which includes the Modern Jazz
Quartet, and now paying
discounted student prices from
$2.50 to $4.50 for that individual
event, Ll of I students are making a
substantial contribution toward
bringing the MJQ to Iowa. The
Auditorium did not feel that it
could authorize an arrangement
which would make the same
concert available to Grinnell‘s
Qtudents for substantially less than
U of I students must pay for it.
I know that student fees at
Grinnell support your visiting
{ultural attractions, I can

 

therefore understand the basis for
Pat Irwin's point of View. But U of I
students not only are helping to pay
ior bringing the MJQ to the state oi
Iowa: they're also paying for the
hall in which such concerts are
held. A portion of student fees at
The University of Iowa are
assigned to retire the bonds which
made Hancher Auditorium
possible.

Although Pat Irwin’s criticism
was exclusively of Hancher
Auditorium, the MJQ is to appear
also at C. Y. Stephens Auditorium
in Ames—on April 14, the night
before its appearance at Hancher.
Even with student discounts equal
to those at Iowa, ISU students will
pay even higher prices than U of I
students for that particular at
tractioniup to $5.00.

The MJQ contracts with both
I-Iancher and C. Y. Stephens were
finalized many months ago, with
Hancher and Stephens dividing the
costs equally ior bringing this
group to the state. Had Grinnell's
potential interest in this particular
event been known at the time
Hancher‘s 1976777 schedule was
being planned, it might have been
possible to work out a financial
arrangement satisfactory to all
three institutionsior even more

 

institutions, if other colleges also
were interested in sharing the
overall costs. Perhaps it will be

possible to work out some such
planning arrangement for the
kinds of programs in which
Grinnell has a special interest.

Grinnell College students and
staff members have attended
many events in Iowa City since
Hancher Auditorium opened here
in 1972. We value that interest
highly—not because Grinnell at-
tendance is essential to the
financial success of any given
event, but because wide regional
interest helps to justiiy Hancher's
comprehensive annual program of
events, many of which are enorr
mously costly.

One of the greatat sources of
pride to the students and faculty
associated with the Iowa Center for
the Arts is the Auditorium's role in
making it possible for thousands of
Iowans throughout the state to
share each year in the richness of
live performances by many of the
world’s leading artists in music,
drama and dance. That pride is
enhanced by the fact that while the
University maintains and staffs
Hancher Auditorium, it does not
subsidize its program oi visiting
attractions. That program was
established. and must be sustained
from year to year, by box office
receipts. Very sincerely, Loren
Hickerson, Director

condition in which we Students
have put ourselves. Not only has
my separation from Grinnell
Enabled me to look at us from an
outsider's perspective. but also
" ing with students from all over
le ACM has shown me that our
problems are not limited to our
selves. The problems are
widespread, affecting the whole
intellectual class of our generation.
Most of the students on this
program are white and mid-
dleclass. (I can't speak for the
blacks on the program—they seem
to consider themselves a separate
people with lives and problems of
their own. Besides, idly talking
about our relations with blacks,
ough fruitful at times, is all too
,n an easy way to avoid con-
minting our relations with our own
people.)
Our background is in the wealthy
suburbs and, it being the official
c to be of. for, and by The
ple, we hide this background
like dirty underwear. When the
white, upper-class population is
discussed, we stare at the floor
uncomiortably. We are ashamcd~
perhaps rightly so~of the world
our parents have built. Yet at the
same time our guilt forces us to

live in conspicuous consumption,

 

_Spending a semester on the
Urban Studies program has given
me an exceptional view of the

sneer insanely at ourselves. We

we say, we are narrow-minded, we
are oppressive (but we couldn’t
wait to go home to that wonderful
house for Christmas),

To watch us tear ourselves apart
is sad indeed. And, in our frantic
critlsm, we turn on others close to
us, At one meeting, we listened to a
woman from the southwest side of
Chicago who spoke to us about the
Marquette Park area. Marquette
Park is Chicago’s answer to South
Boston, except the whites are
fighting not busing but open
housing: We rose up in righteous
wrath'and denounced this woman’s
racism and the racism of her
neighbors. We gave no thought
whatsoever to the fact that she was
no more racist than us, and very
little thought to the complexity of
her background.

The southwest area is a working-
class community composed of
lightly-knit ethnic groups. These
are people who just barely make a
living, and their homes and neigh-
borhoods are as sacred to them‘ as
their Catholic Church. I am told
that these are neighborhoods
where a man can step onto his back
porch, throw a rock in any
direction, and hit a relative. They
are communities, where a fellow
lives with his heritage and 'his
people every day and doesn’t want
to lose them.

We don't understand how this
attitude can make people panic, To

us, a family, a neighborhood, mean
nothing. How many oi us have
relatives within walking distance
oi our home? How many of us
really expect to live on in our old
neighborhood? Damn few, I
suspect.

We are rootless, and that is how
we think of other people. Behind
our condemnation of the people of
the southwest side lies an
ignorance of, and even a contempt
for, working people and the
working way of life. I can‘t stress
this contempt enough. It is a result
of our leisurely upbringing and our
own self-satisfied, critical life-
style.

The young leftist in America is
caught between his rebellion from
his own upperrclass roots and his
disdain for working people.
Lacking a social group upon which
he can inflict his ideology. his
vision of radical change becomes
intellectualized, becomes a mere
object oi speculation.

In Chicago on the Urban Studies
program. I have been in many a
sorry gathering of coniused
students who discuss the coming
revolution We converse dreamily,
“If we can forge a coalition of
blacks. latinos, militant women,
and college students, perhaps . .
Or we reflect back to what our
older brothers and sisters did in the
late IBWS—to that time when, if
only we had been born five years
earlier, we world have been
glorious: we would have done
something. When the conversation
ends, we arc depressed,

By turning away from those who
raised us (the upper class), by
looking down upon the majority of
our country (white working
people), and by idealizing the very
people among whom we will never
have a place (the blacks), we have
effectively paralyzed ourselves
We are a class, we are a
generation, cast adrift. We have
nowhere to go. We have doomed
ourselves to a life of inaction and
guilt.

Bizzarro

by Mark s. Anderson
I was recently talking with
someone who left Grinnell after a
few years with no intention oi
returning to this school. She was
lamenting the fact that She had
merely left the school, the city, and
the “Experience" quietly. There
was no ceremony for her. If she
would have stayed on for another
year or two, she could have gone
through with commencement, thus
punctuating the Grinnell phase of
her life. As it stands now for her,
and for so many other faces that
have disappeared from campus,
the “Grinnell Experience” is a
dangling participle; an unfinished
symphony; a James Joyce story;
a. . . uh, . . . well, whatever it is,
it’s a shame that those who choose
to abort their “Experience" and
transfer or drop out must do so
without any kind of official byebye
from the school. Maybe Pres.
Turner could hand out a citation
for valor to all of those who tried
and, unfortunately, failed to cope
with Grinnell for their “n,
dergraduate years. This could
have a ceremony attached to it,
complete with' costumes and a
speaker. Ican see it now...
it is a Tuesday morning, just one
week before the commencement
exercises for the class of '77. and
the dropouts from the last four
years are about to celebrate their
decision to leave with an ap
propriate ceremony and a few
words from the speaker, Gary
Cooper. All of the empty beds and
extra floorspace in the off-campus
houses and apartments have been
occupied in the last few days as the
dropouts have returned to
Capistrano for one last iling. The
Longhorn and the Pub are co

 

commencement

sponsoring this event, seeing as
they are the ones who will profit
the most irom it, The non-grads
are now lined up and are awaiting
the presentation of the citations.
Instead of the traditional
graduation robes, they are wearing
bathrobes. I don‘t know why, so
don’t ask me.

As I look down the line of
bloodshot eyes, uncombed hairs,
and Colgate smiles, I recognize
several faces, among them Dave
Angsten, Amy Benecki, the Hound,
Laura Fredendall, Ezra, Pam
Griffith. Fred Hirsch, Ben Katz,
Scott Meltzer (who? . , .), Kim
Morourley, Betsy Mullen
(0migodl) Janet Sink, Rich
Stohlman, Fred Thiemann, Dave
White, and Dave Wagner, who is
standing in the rear of the line
muttering, “Why am I here? I
graduated, I think . . . I did, didn’t
I". Ithink I musthave by now. . .”

Now the candidates for the
B.E.A. degree are filing past the
President of the College. (0h,
Bachelor of Evasive Action.) First,
Pres. Turner assumes the stance of
a stern administrator; hands on
hips, frowning and glaring at the
former students. Then the latter,
with hands in pockets, shufﬂes
feet, looks sheepish, then shrugs
his or her shoulders. The President
then breaks into a huge grin, and
they shake hands while the dropout
receives a certificate with one gold
star on it for every semester he or
she served in the Grinnell EXv
perience. At the end, Chris Puts
nam, representing the non-grads,

. gives the closing words: ”I don't

know about the rest of you, but I’m
going back to bed."

Maybe that is how it all would
look. Maybe not. Who cars.
anyway?

15 there honor
at Grinnell?

To the Editor: Last semester is
weeks behind us and yet a seething
anger remains irom an almost ally
class cheating incident. It is
probably a common situation:
several students made special
arrangements to take a final in
advance of the scheduled date.
Classmates acquired the questions
and were able to do the specific
sort oi studying that would make
finals nobody's headache. In this
case, the professor was contacted,
and a new exam was written. Case
rests, right? Wrongl My anger is
accompanied by a gnawing tear
that Grinnell has taken a turn for
the worse.

One aspect of Grinnell that
seems essential to an institution of
its nature, or oi the nature it claims
to be, is the “high code oi personal
honor" called for on page ii of the
197647 Student Handbook.

Academic integrity is important

to our lives at Grinnell. Each time
a professor makes an assignment .
or leaves a class unmonitored
during a test, heshe depends on
the honor of those students to do
their own work. Each student
depends on the honor of the others
to insure a fair evaluation (grade,
ii you will). Students who arrange
to take exams early depend on
themselves to insure that their
grade does not suffer because
others have prior knowledge.
(Besides getting to go home
earlyl) We all depend on each
other here because the reputation
oi Grinnell depends on our respect
of this code.

A complacent attitude toward
the disintegrationuof academic
integrity promises only a certain
loss for all of usinothing less than
our selfrrespect is at stake if we
participate in cheating or sit
silently by as others do.—i\'alne
