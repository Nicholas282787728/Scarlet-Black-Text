Harried social programmer answers all your questions

You‘d probably better un.
derstand my motivations for
writing this article if you‘d ever
been ousted out of a nice warm
bath by a telephone caller who
wanted to know if Tiny Tim is
available on the lecture circuit.
(He is.)

The college's social program
prompts a lot of curiosity. so let me
ensure the serenity of my future
baths by dealing with the Ten Most
Commonly Asked Questions in one
fell swoop. The question and an»
swer format is supposed to create
an impression of frankness and
sincerity.

Q. Why won't you creeps hire my
Uncle Ernie? He’d be great in
South Lounge.

A: WE WOULDN‘T want to
interfere with his familial
obligations. But if you have a
recording oi him, Eric
Christiansen will try to listen to It
wiUu an open mind, And if Uncle
Ernie isa disco king whose rightful
place is North Lounge, speak with
Leslie Taylor.

Q Why do you creeps schedule
general interest activities during
my special interest group's
Weekend‘.7

A: There is no such animal as a
soverelgn weekend in our social
programming, If we did not
schedule any ”general” events no
a weekend that had been reserved
by a group, the calendar would be
very strange looking.

For example. November's four
weekends include events for the
Gay Community. the Women's
Group, the international Students
and Concerned Black Students

It' we considered those groups as
the sole reSIdents oi the weekends,

 

We would not have had the WaltZt
the Loose Hall Ball, the Bill Evans
Dance Co, To Have and Have Not,
All the President's Men, Lenny and
the Film Classics Program, among
other events.

OBVIOUSLY. weekends
have to be shared and events
juggled to accommodate everyone
A lecture on “Norwegian Yodeling
Techniques” can't be the highlight
of Saturday night, however
editying; students can't and
shouldn’t be forced to do something
that doesn’t interest them and it’s
only fair to provide a wide variety
of events, particularly on
weekends.

Q. Why don't you creeps get The
Rocky Horror Picture Show?

A: THE FILM WAS here just last
year: the film committee tries not
to repeat itself within a three or
four year cycle. There are so many
other terriﬁc films the campus
hasn‘t hadiwhy don't you Rock
IIoi-ror fans start lobbying for
them7 Or at least for one of the
newer cult films? C'mon; Rocky

provided for general use. Although
SGA is not required to give any of
the money to special interests, they
do support worthwhile events when
possible.

If you've'been unable to get
social program money for your
special event. it‘s probably
because the planning land spenr
ding) is done up two months in
advance and the money gets
tighter as we get into the year.

Q: WIIY HAVEN'T We had a
ventriloquist?

A: Uh. I dunno, Someone did ask
this. What can i say? Do you know
a cheap one? We had a call from a
mentalist who wanted to read
minds in Roberts Theatre. He
claims he will find his check no
matter where we hide it, It's sort of
like a ventriloquistiwould that
do"

open space

Q' What‘s this I hear about
popcorn at the movies?

A: Yep. We‘re negotiating a big
popcorn deal.

Q: when are we going to have
the Grateful Dead?

A: SIGII. TIIAT kind of money is
at the University of Michigan or
UCLAt not here. We probably
couldn't afford a lecture from
Jerry Garcia's mother. I know this
is a hard truth to grab, like iinding
out that's your father in the Santa
Claus, suit. but . . We are touI‘r
takers. not tour-makers. We don't
pick out the group we want: we
find out who will be in the area and
then grovcl. wheedle, beg, plead
and pray.

Major concerts are similar to
acts of God. The Major Concerts
Lommlttee (John Buckwalter, Ben
Simon) can tell you about what's

available and check your family
tree to see if you have a distant
relation to a rock or jazz star that
we could use.

Q: WHY IS TIIE FILM program
so slanted”

A: Slanted towards what?! The
people who dislike foreign lllms
think it'sslanted in favor of foreign
films. The people who dislike
Pauline Kael think it favors the
films she applauds. Some people
think we need more films with Asta
the wonder dog. The only way to
tell when the program is balanced
is hen the complaints are evenly
divided.

I think that makes ten.

Q: Why don‘t we have any films

any star of your choice i Hc s my
fave.

A. Good idea Ask Hudson
Miller, film chairman, Joe
Diiesterhaus or Michael Steiner
about it. They wantsuggestlons.

PLACING STUDENT and
faculty nonrvoting members on the
Board of Trustees as an additional
mode of studentrfaculty interaction
would not only promote better
relations among the three groups.
but would also provide the trustees
with more information and
viewpoints before they make their
decisions. ‘

Often the trustees are too far
removed from the college's actual
problems, For example, many
trustees were ”surprised"vand

Wllh the alumni, faculty and

harm the college and the trustees
