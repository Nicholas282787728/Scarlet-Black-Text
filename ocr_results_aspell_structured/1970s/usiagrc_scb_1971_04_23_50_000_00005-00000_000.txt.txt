48 New Siudenl Advisers Chosen

by Yvor Stookley

The Final Selection Commit-
tee for Student Advisors chose
48 applicants last week for
student advisor posts for the
1971-72 academic year.

The committee, composed of
thrcc resident advisorsrr Bill
Abdallah, Rosemary Ash, and
Ed Leong--and three students
"Bill Kilpatrick, Joanne Men
dak, and chairman Lesa Che-
raskin» - considered 85 candb
dates for the positions.

"Most of the candidates ch07
sen," said Ed Leong, Clark
RA, "were mainly freshmen
and sophomores due to the
lack of juniors applying for
selection." Of the 48 students
chosen, 26 are men and 22
are women.

i general ceiling for the
number of SA’s was set at 50
to 60 students, btit the com-
mittee members did not feel
they were required to fill a
quota. "We didn’t go with any
borderline cases,” comment
ed Ed, "we simply chose those
people we felt could best do
the Job.”

Students interested in be-
coming S>\’s next year were
asked to file an application
with the Student Dean's office
indicating why they were in-
tcrcsted in student advising,
any experience they had had
in this area, and their will-
ingness to work with Resid~
ent Advisors and undergo
some sort of training pro-
gram.

Recommendations were also
requested and each candidate
was interviewed by a team of
students and RA’s.

“it was impossible to accept
everyone who applied," said
Bill Abdallah, RA in the Norr
rises, “If nothing else wejust
didn’t have room for 85 SA's.
Things got rolling late this
year. We hope to improve the
selection process.”

Most of the committee mem-
bers, however, expressed gee
neral satisfaction with the scl-
eclion process and the group

of students who were chosen.
“I don't think it was the fail"
est selection method p05.
sible," added Ed Leong, “but
it was the fairest for the given
situation. I'm reasonably hap‘
py with the group we have
selected. I’d say l’m pretty
optimistic about them."

The Committee noted, that
one of the factors which figs
ured into the rejection ofa
number of the freshman appli-
cants was a consideration of
experience. Many of these
people should be encouraged
to reapply next year if they
are still interested.

Several charges of bias have
been leveled at the committee.
Some questions have been rain
sed as to whether any "far
out" or ”individual” types of
students were systematically
eliminated from considera-
tion. Ed Leong said “There
were as many “groovy" as
”non-groovy" types selected.
I don‘t think this was ever one
of the questions. if there was
any kind of bias, it was a Sla’
tistical biaswrrnot too many
“far out" people applied for
the job."

There has been some criti"
cism of the committee as exr
hibiting racial bias. To this
Ed Leong said, “i feel it is
a totally unfair criticism. I
voted for whites. I voted for
blacks. I voted for Asiatics.
I voted against whites. I voted
against blacks. Ivotedagainst
Asiatics."

The committee will be sub»
mitting a detailed list of re-
commendations forfuture selr
ection of student advisors to
the Student Dean’s office and
the Committee A counseling
sub- committee. Among the
changes to be recommended
will be an improved briefing
of interviewing teams, earlier
application deadline to allow
for possible rerinterviewing,
and an improved recommew
dation blank aimed at presen-
ting a more balanced picture
of the individual including

Radical Garrett Talks on Vietnam

by Bill Knecht

Banning Garrett, Southeast
Asia Editor for Ramparts ma-
gazine, coauthor of Two,
Three, Many Vietnams, and
self»styled ”intellectualgur
errilla," delivered three lec-
ture-discussions to Grinnell
inhabitants this week.

“The Present Situation in
lndo—China” was the topic of
the first presentation. Gar-
rett traced the history of the
Viet Minh movement in Viet-
nam from the earliest French
involvement up to the present
day, with special emphasis on
U.S. attempts to remake the
Vietnamese culture.

weaknesses and strengths.

Two features intended to st-
rengthen the student advising
program next year will in-
clude much closer “teamr
work" between hall officers,
RA and SA's, a proposal for
the appointment of additional
student advisors during the
year in consultationwith RA’s,
house officers and students in
the halls, and the “tiring" of
nonreffective student advis-
ors.

The SA’S Will be placed fol'
lowing the House Presidents
Clcctions according to where
they can work best as a team
with newly elected presidents
and assigned Resident Advir
sors.

Four of the current resident
advisers will be returning in
the fall. They are Rosemary
Ash, Bill Abdallah, Prudence
Millite, and Steve and Irene
Mohr. Three others are yet
to be named. They will be
placed along with the student
advisors.

Garrett feels that the U.S.'

is trying to dEStroy the clas-
sic Vietnamese culture in or
der to institute an American-
ized form of capitalism there,
much with the same attitude
that religious missionaries
have long tried to remake
religious beliefs all over the
world. He followed American
attempts, initially ones to
try to “win the hearts and
minds of the people," noting
the failure of these efforts,
and the final breakdown to
attempts to control only the
behavior of the people, when
it became clear that the ideo-
logical battle had been lost.

Garrett elaborated on the
massive physical destruction
the American presence has
wrought on Vietnam and its
neighboring countries, ex-
pressing concern as to "when
ther there’s going to be a
Vietnam 1ch to rebuild,” con-
sidering the effects mass
bombing, burning and defoliar
tion have had on the ecology
of the area.

According to Garrett, the
pressure of recent NLF ”vice
tories," coupled with the
domestic situation in the U.S.,
might force Nixon into an
invasion of North Vietnam, in
a lastrditch attempt to beat
the liberation forces before
the upcoming presidential elr
ection. This might even in-
volve the use of tactical nu~
clear weapons, he thinks. In
the event of such an invasion,
he feels that the possibility of
a Chinese intervention would
be highly likely.

Garrett says he ”absolutely
want(s) to see an NLF vic-
tory" and feels that the Vict
Cong would pose the best al-
ternative to the preservation
of peace and of the culture of
Vietnam.

in a panel discussion with
Professors Al Jones and
James Magee, Garrettdiscus-
sed the role of social scien-
tists in the planning of mili-
tary strategies. He cited nu~
merous cases of pure socio-
logical and anthropological
research being funded by the
Department of Defense and
the Agency for International
Development for the purpose

leggeii Pleads For
Usual Caps, Gowns

President Glenn Leggett is~
sued a plea at Monday's faculty
meeting for all seniors and
faculty to observea traditional
commencement this spring.

Leggett said that a tradition-
al ceremony "does not dim-
inish us as individuals or as
a college in any way, and I
believe it may enhance us
institutionally in the public
and private mind.

He pointed out the import
ancc of the event to some face
ulty, some students, the trus-
tees, himself, visitors and
especially parents. “Under-
standably, parents want to
have some good feelings about
it; they want a measure of
the academic symbolism and
a ceremonial that will reﬂect
their own commitment of mo-
ney, effort and above all, a
son or a daughter to this adds
demic enterprise.”

Leggett said, "I enlist the
support of both students and
faculty for a traditional cere-
mony with caps and gowns for
students and faculty."

While not enthusiastic about
die idea, the Senior Year Co-
mmittee has decided not to

oppose President Leggett on
the matter.

Steel Sees Us As Imperialisi

Last Sunday night, author
Ronald Steel presented a pic-
ture of Americans as apeople
who would like to believe
themselves idealistic and
anti-imperialist, but have
recently come to the rcalizar
tion through the Indochina war
and other post-World War II
actions that “We have been
deceiving ourselves."

In his lecture on America
as an imperial power in the
midrtwentieth century, Steel
portrayed recent American
foreign policy as one ofmainr
taining the status quo in the
world, through numerous dir-
ect and indirect interventions
in other countries and the two
major land wars in Indochina
and Korea.

Steel said American policy
makers have defined the na~
tional interest as the suppres-
sion of revolutionary governr
ments throughout the world,
especially through indirect
military and economic sup»
port to friendly regiemes.
According to Steel, the ideo-
logimly basis of this perceir
ved national interest and the
policy derived from it lies in
both old isolationism, which
carried the implication that
the United States was better
and more idealistic than the
rest of the world, and the
anti-communist ideology, bed
gun originally to gain popular
support for moves needed to
counteract the Soviet Union’s
expansion in Eastern Europe
rather than any danger from
communism as an ideology.
Once the rhetoric of Amer-
ican foreign policy beanie
established, Stet-l said, policy
makers thought in those
terms, of trying to create a

world situation lavorablc to

America as an imperial coun-
try. Vietnani, Stcel believes,
was no abberntion or “quag-
mire"; it was a real part of
our policy of trying to control
the world under ”itlcaliStic"
and antircommunistic mote
ives.

America, Stccl contended,
has built up an “informal ems
pire” in the post world War
II era. It is an empire n0t
built on the control ofterri-
tories, but on the control of
them, often by such dcflses
as “Vietnamizaiion” ~ the
execution of American policy
objectives by the Vietnamese.

Whether or not the direction
of our policy can be changed
red lly depends on whatits mu~
scs are. Stccl believes iliat
bOth the liberals who believe
that ”our heart is in the right
place", but we were not \l’ist‘
enough to avoid such “quiigy

mites” as Vietnam, and the
radicals who believe that the
policy is economimlly deter-
mined are mistaken.

Steel believes that we can
change our direction in foreign
policy by changing our ideas
that we should create the world
in our own image; he believes
that we should channel the
native idealism which got us
involved in the world siniation
in the first place into creating
a foreign policy ofdisinvolw-
ment. Such a change may be
the work of a generation, he
said, and it requires primar»
ily education ofall thepeople.

During much of Steel's lec-
ture, A black cat, presumably
symbolic of recent \n‘ierican
foreign policy, walked around
and tried to sleep on the Stage
of Roberts Theater. By the
time of Steel’s sonieulint op»
[imiSiiC conclusion, however,
the cat had left.
