magnificent rock and roll band.

Who Are You is lively music
which doesn‘t reflect an iota of
impending death. and while not a
particularly strong album. Pete
Townshend and the Who showed
inspired optimism in its creation.

It is an album of seemingly
unrelated songs, but as 15 usually
the case with the Who, an
overriding iiavor or theme is
discernible. Here it seems to be a
reaction to contemporary soCiety,
a kind oi modern day

the “cantus lirmus,” and songs
such as ”Sister Disco," “905" (a

commentary on current SDCtal and
musical phenomenon.

It’s sci fi time

by Michael Greenﬁeld

This weekend’s films could
probably be characterized as the
good, the bad and the ugly.

The Day the Earth Stood Still
begins with the unlikely
proposition of an ominous
spaceship landing in (where else?)
Washington, D C. From the
spaceship emerges a man called
Klaatu and a wonderiul robot
named Gort, who reside on a planet
hundreds of years ahead of ours

The visitors are received with
general hostility. suspicion, and
tear. Klaatu ultimately gains the
trust oi a young war widow, hei-
eleven year old son, and a
distinguished scientist. These red»
blooded Americans lleln him pave
the way for the delivery oi his
message Sound a bit trite? Well,
what did you expect? Nonetheless,
this is not a bad film compared to
Death Race 2000.

David Carradine, who at limes
has shown the rudiments of a
superb actor, stars, if you want to
call it that, in this Iilm about all
ultrasviolent transcontinental
race. Carradine plays the role of
Frankenstein, the past champion.
and sauntels around the screen in
a spooky black outfit, moving the
audience to dislike him intensely,

Crashes occur like clockwork
throughout the mayhem. where
hitsand-run driving is the national
sport and the winner of the race is
determined nntonly by the position
oi linish, but by points gained by
knocking oil hapless pedestrians.
Il taken with a grain of salt, the
movie could pass [or humorous.
but little else.

Finally, we are being invaded
this weekend by The Creature

which will be shown in a novel
manner. It you have never exr
perienced a CH) lllm, it is nothing
but pure, unadulterated ion,

In the film. the monster is found
lurking in the stagnant, primordial
depths oi a mysterious tropical
lagoon

His goals and aspirations are the
same as man‘s, which leads to
your basic human»against~non-
human struggle representing our
prehistoric struggle against other
species. The iiglit and normalcy oi
the real world above the water is
irequently contrasted With the
’lark, and often macabre world
below. AS [or the ending, wcll l'll'
give you one guess

surprisingly, they lack the in
tensity. When Roger Daltrey proV
claims, “there’s just one thing leii
in the endiyour guitar and your
pen...” you have a ieeling he
means it but you still aren’t quite
sure.

in contrast. other ventures such
as “Sister Disco," “Had Enough,”
and “Love is Coming Down" sound
basically like lost Quadruphenia
tapesfthereby not straying too far
from the essential meaning behind
rock and roll

Musically, Who are You is full ol
excellent ideas which are
weakened by Townshend's
overiiidulgencc with synthesizers
and strings. This is a less personal
album for Townshend than his
previous one Who by Numbers)
and the producers seem to want the

 

album to sell.

Although they’re a bit diluted,
the Who shines through. The
thrashing guitar and the thun»
dering drums are present but, not
protruding with the insane con»
viction oi the past. Roger Daltrey
sounds good, and the production,
while weak, is not intolerable.

Who Are You should do well. both
as a collector‘s item and as a
record. [Ls faults are tmostly)
understandable, the music is good,
and it is, after all, the Whoiot'
course a legend, This probably is
not how Pete Townshend and the
Who wanted to go out, but who can
say” At. this point, I'll Stop and let
Rolling Stone go into a
deeper discussion oi the Who and
its hi5tory~ I reel tears coming to
my eyes.
