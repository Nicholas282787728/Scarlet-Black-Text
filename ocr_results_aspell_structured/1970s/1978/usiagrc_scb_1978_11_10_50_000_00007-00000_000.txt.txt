secreuiry, reports that while no
official vote was taken, an in-
formal show of hands by the
members present unanimously
endorsed the decision to raze
Mears. These alumni represenr
tatives, some of whom toured
lvtears, accepted the observation
that the building simply was not
safe alld that the costs of
renovation were too much

When word of the trustees'
winter decision lirst leaked outlast
June, several taculty members
expressed their concern and made
inquiries. Any actual demolition.
President Turner then said, was at
least three years in the future, a
condition the trustees were to alter
in October

Meanwhile, laculty members
brought the question of Meal's's
future before the {all meeting of
the iacullyrtruslee committee. a
body where issues or mutual
concern can be discussed Trustee
members of that committee were
delensivc about the issue. ac-
cording to one tacult participant,

THE TItUSTEI ‘ reportedly
stressed the same points or
Mears’s dilapidated condition and
the exorbilanl cost ot repairs, No
mention was made of plans to
spend undoubtedly an even greater
sum on Norris. a building less than
20 years old, nor were iaculty
members apprised or current
considerations to close Mears next
June

Several questions persist
regarding the trustees' decision to
go against the recommendation or
the Dober Report. Why opt for
what appears clearly in that report
to be the least destrable of three
choices?

to 't', ACCORDING to
President Turner, was the deciding
factor. However, he admits there is
as yet no clear estimate oi the cost
of adding a [ourth floor to Norris,
as yet no clear estimate of the cost
ot razing Mears; and as yet no
Clear estimate of the Cost of
restoring the west facade ot Main
Hall, which will require extensive
attention if Mears comes down

Turner acknowledged that these
tigures, particularly the latter, will
probably be considerable How
then could the trustees, with so
little concrete information, be so
confident their decision was
tinancially prudent, even betore
one introduces the possibility of
tederal assistance or support trom
concerned alumni and friends for
restoring or rehabilitating Mears?

FINALLY, ON THE financial
aspects of the decision, the Dober
Report also stated that the $349,500
tigure might be considerably
lowered by having some of the
work, such as carpeting, painting
and other minor renovations, done
in-house by the college's own ex-
tensive physical plant stall, This
smff has been employed often in
the past [or similar work on other
buildings which the college has
chosen to renovate. How seriously
was this possibility explored?

Even were Mears to cost the
same or somewhat more to
renovate, do not aesthetic, historic
and Sentimental constderations all
weigh more heavily in its iavor
than does compounding the
mistake of Holiday Inn North, as
Norris is cynically called by
many?

WHAT ARE THE real costs oi
restoring Mears as a cottage
residence? What would be the costs
of rehabilitating it for an alter»
native use or for a combination of
residential and other uses which
the Dober Associates suggested in
their report7

If the building's practical service
as a residence is past, could it not
be protitably adaptediwhile
preserving its essential features—
as a study center or an honors
college? As office space? As an art
gallery? As a new home for the
psychology department in order
that Goodnow be restored Dr
rehabilimted as an art gallery?
Should either Mears or Goodnow
be deemed feasible [or the gallery
now envisioned by the college at an
estimated cost of $500,000, the
college could abandon that plan
and perhaps have the gallery in a
National Register building Con-
verted with the aid of federal
iunding.

THE TRUSTEES Should also

financtal ramifications, This
