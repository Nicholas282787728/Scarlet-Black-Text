Mo-ped menace looms

Once again, as a new semester
starts. we Grinnellians are too
much immersed in our own per
sonal problems and concerns to
take note oi a growing wave or
terror which threatens to engulf us
up to our chins. our mouths, our
nostrils. our tear ducts, etc.

No, we’re more interested in a
freshman’s first bakery run and
avoiding thelines at Cowles than in
addressing the evil which
threatens to transform the Grinnell
Experience into a hideous mockery
of its former self. More momentous
even than the housing shortage, the
pronouncements of doomsday
prophets, or the insidious
metamorphosis of Grinnell
students from radical activists to
capitalist running dogs futilely
pursuing the mechanical rabbit of
wealth around the greyhound track
of exploitation, this ominous new
development threatens to disrupt
campus \life even more than does
the accreditation report. I am
speaking, of course, of the Mo-ped
Menace.

BUT WHAT'S SO menacing
about mo—peds, you may ask?\
They’re harmless little machines;
relatively quiet, practical, easy to,
ride, and above all chic and
European. Exactly! But that's
what makes them so dangerous! In
the hands oi a certain type oi
warped criminal mind. the mo-ped
assumes a lethal significance far
removed from mere trans
portation. Giving a mo-ped to one
of these sick youths is like putting
Dirty Harry in charge of a
Minuteman silo.

But who are these sick youths,
you may ask, as you tremble with
fear and trepidation, Well, I’ll tell
you. A new breed of student is
infiltrating Grinnell, arising from
the teeming, afﬂuent suburbs of
our nation. Usually raised by their
housekeeper in broken homes on
the right side of the
tracks, these kids have known
nothing but abundance and
prosperity all their lives. From the
very beginning they’ve had a rough
time of it—unlimited toys, good
schools, easy access to drugs and
alcoholiand they feel trapped and
cheated by a society that offers
them nothing more than the fate of
their parents as well-paid, co—opted
doctors and lawyers.

mom THE perspective oi these
uniortunate young people, society
is a boring road to nowhere.
Without hope, the jaded scions of
suburbia turn to soccer, punk rock,
marijuana, and other diversions to
occupy their decadent minds, but

 

The Scarl

 

these things too soon lose their
appeal, and our nowrhardened
delinquents discover the moped.

The mo-ped gives them a feeling
of power and identity. a powerful
weapon with which to thrash out
against the incomprehensibility
and injustice of the world. On a mo-
ped a suburban delinquent can
roar up and down sidewalks,
dislodging Boy Scouts and old
ladies; Weave in and out of
crowded lounges and loggias; ride
roughshod through polite coma
munities, leaving havoc and
destruction in his wake, and do all
this without compromising his
image or removing his Levis, down
jacket, and alligator-emblazoned
shirt.

GOD ONLY KNOWS how they
did it, but by some subtle and in-
sidious process, the mo-ped-borne
brigands are now among us, in the
very midst of Middle American
culture and enlightenment.
Already several gangs have been
iormed on campus, making their
fiendish presence known through
the fear and terror they inspire in
their Victims. President Turner is
too frightened to admit it, but he
didn’tshave his beard just because
he was tired of being mistaken for
Orson Welles. One dark night along
Park Street. poor old ART was
jumped by a moped gang known
as the Scarsdale Slashers and
forcibly shaved.

In a similar vein. the ritual
slaughter of the pigeons that used
to most on ARI-l was the work of the
North Shore Knightriders, Aghast
at this senseless orgy of violence
and destruction. Courageous hall
rep (and clean-cut Midwestemer)
Ace Bowers sought to introduce a
Joint Board resolution banning mo»
peds from campus, but was cruelly
attacked and beaten by a masked
band of moped desperadoes before
he could even get to the meeting,
Obviously, the proper authorities
are helpless in the face of the mo-
ped menace.

WHAT. THEN ARE we to do? AS
Lazlo Totll. a hard-bitten product
oi the mean streets oi Westport,
Connecticut. defiantly puts it,
”There‘s nothing the forces of law
and justice can do to stop us. If
they outlaw or register mopeds,
we can still get them on the street.
Ifthey arrest us, our parents'll just
bail us out." Indeed, nothing short
of a total reform of the subculture
that produced these misfitséa
massive suburban renewal
programiseems even iaintly
likely to have any beneficial effect.
Until then. no one is safe.

Urges tuition tax credit support

by Ted Vlamis

Few issues have been so clouded
by political posturing as the
proposed tuition tax credit, Rather
than being reasonably debated, it
has become a political football
kicked back and forth as each
person involved attempts to get
hiSrher plan adopted so that heshe
can claim credit for relieving the
tax burden of the middle class.

The motives behind the tuition
credit, which would extend a tax
credit to parents or students
paying tuition. are easily un-
derstood. The most immediately
evident motive is the tax relief it
gives to the already over-taxed
middle class.

THERE HAVE HISTORICALLY
been two criteria for granting tax
breaks. The first is extending
breaks to those with major ex-
penses, such as medical expenses,
which affect their ability to pay.
Tax breaks are also used to en-
courage activities considered to be
good. giving rise to the investment
tax credit, as well as tax credits for
charitable contributions. home
insulation, etc. The tuition tax
credit meets both these criteria.

Americans are justly proud that
in our nation the individual reigns
supreme, The protection oi my
dividual rights is a primary cons
cern of the Bill of Rights.

IN RECENT YEARS. however.
massive government interference
has begun to erode this his
dividuality and to homogenize our
culture, stifling creativity and
innovation in the process. If we are
to remain a collection of unique
individuals and allow creativity

‘ and innovation to flourish, we must

allow alternatives to the ins
creasingly pervasive role of
government in education.

In addition to this, there is
another reason why the preser-
vation of a strong private school
system is essential to our national
wellrbeing. The manner in which
one is taught to think substantially

iinfluences hiSrher subsequent

thought. it all are taught in public
Schools, all will tend to think alike,
the result that the
proliferation of new ideas will be

‘ greatly diminished.

WHAT THEN ARE the
arguments against the tuition tax
credit? Perhaps the most serious

 

charge leveled against it is that it
is unconstitutional, because many
rivate schools are reli iousl

affiliated But all kinds of non .
profit organizations are given tax
breaks. The fact that
many of these organizations are
religious is a coincidental fact and
does not make such tax breaks
unconstitutional.

Likewise. the fact that many
private schools are religiously
affiliated is a coincidental fact.
The effect of the tuition tax credit
is to aid students, not religious
organizations.

IT IS INTERESTING to note
that in 1876 the Republican Party
platform contained the lollowing
plank: . ,We recommend an
amendment to the Constitution of
the United States, forbidding the
application of any public funds or
property [or the benefit of any
school or institution under Sec-
tarian control,” Note that people
who opposed aid to sectarian
schools realized that to make such
aid unconstitutional would require
a constitutional amendment.

The argument that the tuition tax
credit will somehow destroy the
public school systems stems irom
a blind. governmentrknowsbest
mentality. Those advancing this
argument seem to think that public
education is in some way superior
to private education, and thus is
more important.

EXAMINATION OF THE facts
shows that a far more real danger
is the decline of the private Schools
which has occurred in recent
years. Ninetyreight per cent of the
decline in elementary and second
ary enrollment from 1965 to 1915
occurred in the private sector.
Private college enrollment, Which
accounted for over 50 per cent of
total college enrollment in I95l. has

Much has been made of the cost
of this program which will rang
from 1.2 to 4 billion dollars,
depending on the iorm which
comes out of the House~Scnate
conference committee. One must
bear in mind that this is not a new
cost outlay: it is a decrease in
revenues With all the waste in
government, 34 billion can easily
be cut from the grossly bloated
budget.

PRESIDENT CARTER, in a bid
to personally take: credit for
relieving the tax burden of the
middle class, has proposed to in
crease the existing grants and
loans programs, while threatening
to veto the tuition tax credit. Th
superiority oi the tuition tax credit
should be evident to all.

Under the President's program
much of the money would go tol
bureaucratic red tape; not so with
the tuition tax credit, Th
President's program also fails t3
help those who need help th
mastithose too wealthy to qualif
for financial aid, but too poor t
bear the high cost oi education.

THE MOST RIDICULOU
argument made by those oppose
to the tuition tax Credit is that it i
merelya windfall for the rich. Thi
is nothing more than an ad
homlnum attack on a very worth
while program in an attempt t
pick up some popularity by ex-
ploiting tired class war themes.

The principle DI a graduated ‘
income tax is that people should
pay in proportion to their ability to
pay, When one incurs expenses
which lessen his- her ability to pay
it is only titting that he—she be
given a tax break. To deny this to
some would be the ultimate in

Garbage What a mess

It is hard to be witty about
garbage. it (garbage. that is) does
not lend itself to, well, witticisms.
ColumnistJack Anderson once had
his garbage inspected by the
government, true, and it was
thrown out of windows in medieval
Europe, but on the whole. it is
difficult to sustain the public's
interest in plain, everyday. run-ofr
the-mill rubbish.

All of this would not be bad if the
reiuse were not so ubiquitous. As it
is, though, one cannot walk across
campus without seeing beer bots
ties cans paper cups and other
artifacs of the college population. i
It is worth inquiring which
segment of the college is engaged
in this, and the answer is lamenr‘
tably obvious: students. It is us.
We are both the perpetrators and
victims of the refuse that blots the
campus.

WHY IS THIS? I cannot believe
that anyone likes to litter, and
surely no one thinks that garbage
beautifies an area. so what is the
reason for it?

There are any number of an
swers at this point. One can argue
that we are lazy. selfrcentered,
careless, thoughtless. or any
combination of the above. And
alas! thewoist part is that these
answers are the correct ones, We
are lazy, selfrcentered, careless

and thoughtless when we leave
such junk lying around, waiting for
B&G to pickup after us. As much as
we shrug it off. it is hard (indeed.
impossible) to reconcile our
behavior, And ironically. it is an
instance where we could do
something [or once instead of
fuming about “student input.”
Even stranger is the fact that we
don't even have to do anything;
instead, simply retrain from doing
something. It is so simple a matter
that writing about it insults the
intelligence. But the problem
persists, and shows no signs of
going away by itseli,

IN THE LONG run there is no
way to convince someone that not
littering is any better than his
tering. The benefits are so obvious
that they are selfrevident, In the
end it all comes down to caring.
Either you care about the en
vironmentor you don’t. Ifyou don’t .
care about the environment,
substitute “Grinnell College" in its
place. Or “other people." There
will be no change. though, until we
decide to’ care about something
other than ourselves. Un~
fortunately, that is not in vogue
these days.

The converse of all of this is to
.care about the land, to take care of
iwhat we have lcit. I believe there is
something intrinsically good about
such an attitude, above and beyond
the obvious material benefits} a
sense oi proportion, or balance, is
restored. Though we may think
differently, we cannot abuse the
earth forever, and we are not its
master. But once again, there is no
way to impart this to one who
chooses to Ignore it.

ALL TIIE SAME. there is
something sad in the indifference
with which we pollute the land-
scape; Ican’t help but ieel that we

_ areglosing something that is
irrecoverable, and that We will be
the lesser for it.
