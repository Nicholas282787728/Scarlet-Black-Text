Miller lashes GOP’S Turner

hyi icBerry .

Tom Miller, the Democratic
challenger to lowa Attorney
General Richard Turner in this
fall’s election, spoke to a small
audience in South Lounge last
Monday on “Why Turner Must
Go "

Miller began by attacking his
opponent's interest in highly
emotional issues that do not con-
cern the office of Attorney General
Such as his opposition to the
ratification of the Panama Canal
treaties.

MILLER claimed. “this tells US
a lot about Richard Turner. What
he did was completely in
consequential; he had nothing to do
with the lawsuit (a suit by some
members of the House of
Representatives who claimed that
the House must approve any treaty
that involved the release of U.S.
propertyt. Still. time and money
were spent which only served the
purpose oi linking Turner's name
with a popular issue. Turner is
hoping that in November people
will remember that they were
opposed to the treaties and that
Turner opposed the treaties,"

Miller charged that this was
similiar to the technique that
Turner used' in the 1974 campaig ;
when Miller was also >
Democratic candidate. “He did
everything possible to publicize the
issue 'of capital punishment by
suggesting that the person to be
executed choose his own means of

 

execution. . .” Miller went on to
explain that the issue of capital
punishment is not within the
authority of the Attorney General,
but rather a concern of the
governor and the legislature.

Miller cited another recent in
stance of this tactic: Turner wrote
a highly publicized letter to the
legislature asking them to legalize
the drug laetrile, which is alleged
to be eiiective against cancer
However, Turner knew that it
would be impossible [or the
legislature to act since the bill was
not on the legislative calendar and
there were only two weeks left in
the session. Miller concluded that
Turner was emphasizing issues
outside his own control “because
he doesn’t want to run on his
record."

POINTING OUT that the budget
for the Iowa Department of Justice
was $2,300,000, Miller contended,
“we do not get that much out of the
Attorney General's office."

Miller stated that, ii elected, he
would Structure the office and staff
around substantive issues rather
than those which have a high
potential for publicity. Among his
top priorities are the enforcement

or the Family Farm Act, an in-
,vesiigation oi the economic power

ol large grain companies, in-
vestigati'on of railroad aban-
donment proceedings, and can
sumer protection.

“You won’t see my name in the
papers as often as you see Turn

 

ner's, but when you‘do, I will be
doing something substantial."

MILLER STATED that he in
tended to restore respect to the
office of Attorney General. He
claimed that Turner is not
respected because he is so
publicity minded and partisan,
and that his opinions are not well
received. Arguing that the At»
torney General’s most important
role is the quasirjudicial function of
handing down opinions in-
terpreting the law, he contended,
“The reaction to Turner's opinion
has been ‘it’s one man’s opinion.’
They are supposed to be
authoritative. . . .Come November,
Iowans will have an Attorney
General they can respect.”

MILLER SAID that he was
optimistic about the campaign,
since as an unknown and under»
financed candidate in 1974 he was
only deieated by a ieiv percentage
points. This year he is much better
known throughout the state and
feels that the voters are growtng
tired of Turner.

Tom Miller was born in Dubuque
and attended Loras College, Alter
Eming his law degree at Harvard
in 1969 he worked (or Vista and
legal services in Baltimore and
served on the start of then-lowa
Congressman John Culver. He also
taught at the University of
Maryland Law School before
returning to the town oi McGregor
in Clayton County in 1973.

Rowdy Rélay‘sretum to campus

by Blake Domics

“No lessons are so quickly iorgotten as the
lessons of history,” These are the words of Mr,
Peter Karney, distinguished Grinnell historian and
Relays mogul, when asked about’ the origins oi the
annual event known as the Grinnell Relays. '

”The mists of time have shrouded much of the
truth about what triggered this recurring spectacle
oi degeneracy,” said Karney tersely. “From what
scant records have been preserved we have
deduced that the idea ripened slowly in the twisted
brain oi a young naval ofﬁcer with a tendency to
indulge in great amounts oi torpedo juice Many
years later. he succeeded in usmg the authoritv cl
hispositionas a Grinnell College faculty member to
coerce several impressionable dupes into staging,
under the guise of an athletic event. a rebellion
against conventional mores. Instead of pronding
the traditional disinhibitory substances, they
audaciously altered “beer for the masses.’

"THIS REVOLT might have been ruthlessly
squelched had several members of the ad-
mlnistrative elite been permitted to act," Stated
Mr. Karney, who is also known for his insightful
political commentary. “But the moderate voice at
PresidentGlen chgett prevailed. ‘Beer is back,’ he
said, ‘and back big,‘ Leggett, oi course, was later
deposed Many scholars believe that his removal.
and the subsequent institution of the present
monarchy. were largely a result oi his reluctance to
take decisive action against the conspirators

“So the first Relays were allowed to blight Ward
Field, and the revolutionaries thereby obtained
surricienl iniluence among the populace to carry out
a similar celebration of intcmpcrance the (ollowmg
year. thus altering iorevcr the systems of social
stimulalion at Grinnell. The rest iS history "

AFTER ALL present had ﬁnished applauding his
lecture, Mr. Karney recounted some of that history,
Much of it, he said, centers around the monumental
iigure oi David TenEyck, who, according to Mr
Karney. was once mistaken by an inebriated Mark
Blanchard tor a giant Relays keg Blanchard was
rcportcdly disabled pcrmanently when he tried to
obtain beer from Mr Tanyck's belt buckle

Prominent economist Lee Arnold, who stumbled
by at this point in the interview, described Mr.
TenEyck differently “TenEyck was a Statistical
anomaly. The concept oi marginal utility iust didn't

BOTH SCHOLARS recalled the Relays evening
when Mr, TenEyck rolled off a roof on which he had
been Snoozing, and awoke only long enough to
request a beer.

Both Mr. Kal'ney and Mr Arnold predicted that
this year s Relays would unfortunately, take place
both also expected as Mr. Karney succinctly put it,

debauchery,
