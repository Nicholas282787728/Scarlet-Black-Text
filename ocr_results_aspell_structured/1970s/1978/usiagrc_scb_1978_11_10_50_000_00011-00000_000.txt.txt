No groups ot Grinnell students spent tall break bicycling and
backpacking through the Ozark Mountains, a total ot ten students
experienced the warm weather, steep inclines and a seemingly
endless stream or dry creek beds.

The backpackers traveled dirt and gravel roads searching for
waterwhlle drinking in the beautiful mountain scenery. Their path
was mostly uphill. but the six were rewarded with impressive
vistas overlooking the Buffalo River.

The cyclists had rough going in the hilly terrain steep climbs
were relieved by soaring downhill runs, But many or the roads were
rather primitive and the dirt and gravel took their toll on both bikes
and bikers. The riders tmally retreshed themselves at Lake Bull
shoals, the lirst abundant supply of water they found.

The groups met in southern Missouri tor the drive back to
Grinnell. each person having had an exhuasting but exciting time

Sees field hockey turnaround

by Sarah Brichford

Life is not all chemistry tests and
labs for senior Minje Martinezi
Athletics have been an integral
part or her Grinnell career, as they
have been tor an increasing
number of Grinnell women.

A four-year field hockey veteran,

tivities? You bet! Awaste of time?

MINJE. LIKE MOST of her
wammales, had never played field
hockey before coming to Grinnell.
She checked it on a list which she
ﬁlled out before she started school
tour years ago. Shortly afterwards,
she received a note in her box
announcing practice. “I hated the
first weeks of practice but it
worked out and I'm glad I went
out," says Minje, “Field hockey
for me is the most together team
spiritrwise.”

Indeed Minje's first season was
tough. With only one returning

GRINNELL WOMEN are more
serious about their athletic pur»
suits these days but the unique
philosophy of Grinnell sports
shines brightly. ”It‘s pretty
evident that women's athletics are
m the upswing. More people are
interestedallraround,” says Minje.
“Because sports are not extremely
intense at Grinnell more people
stay out tor a team because it's
enjoyable, but you can win."

At a ripe old age or about ten
years, hockey is one or the two
oldest women's intercollegiate
sports. The other oldstimer is
tennis.

they fell to Carleton h-t)

made the difference. She ﬁgures
you can have fun and win at the

us the sticks and say, ‘well, good
luck.’ Somehow you always telt
that she thought you could never
win."

The combination of skilled
players in the class of '30 and

‘ Winkler's coaching did the trick for
Grinnell, “We won which was quite
the thrill," says Minje, “A big
comment made by specmtors was,
‘It's not boring to watch anymore.‘
We had a 200 per cent im-
provement over the previous
year." Although the team did not
iinish with a winning record, they
had made tremendous gains

tradition was on its way, During
Minje’s junior year the team went
7-55. However, the state tour-
nament was Somewhat of a
disaster for the Pioneers who
finished fifth out of Six teams, Due
to an odd fie~breaking rule.
Grinnell lost two tie games on
penalty strokes.

The Pioneers rebounded to
compile a very successful record
this season “This year was really
sallsfying because we came so
close to regionals," reflects Minje,
“I guess my hopes were especially
high because of all the losses
during my freshman year.”

THERE HAVE BEEN positive
changes in crowd support as well,
although field hockey’s increasing
popularity fell prey to the usual
antics ot the ab squad, Minje
recalls, ”During my first year I'd
get my roommates out there to
watch but now we get lots of
support especially from the soccer
team. A couple of years ago
someone moaned 3 ref and called
one of the other team's players a
Neanderthal woman. That team
lost and their coach blamed it on
our bad crowd,” Who else but the

ob squad?

In the four short years that lvtinje
Martinez has trod upon the turf of
Mac Field as a member of Grin-
nell's field hockey team the
aspirations ot her and her team»
mates became reality.

circle of competitive women’s
teams, but thanks to dicehard
participants like Minje, the
Pioneers are able to hold their own

were able to score." Coach Bowers

commented. “Our defense was
scored upon in three long plays,
lwqrcverses and one long pass. We
lost to the number one team in the
blue division."

Bowers reflected on the Pioneer
Season: “We were better than our
zero and four record indicated. The
two-division conference helped us
a great deal this year. We went into
games thinking we had a good
chanckall we needed were two or
three key men to have a good ball
club.

“GUR DEFENSE was ranked
number one in the blue division,"
Bowers continued, “Mainly due to
four adept seniors: Steve Bolesta
and Ken O'Barski were a great
asset to our defensive line, Charlie
Gogel was a very good linebacker
and Dave Seeberger was very good
at the defensive end position,”

Discussing the future Bowers
added. “offensively we lose center
Chris Mal, guard Chris Bowman,
Al Camp and Cornell Rudov, The
departing seniors will greatly
affect the defense in terms of size
and experienced ability If we're
going to make a showing or any
sorts In the conference nexl
year,we're going to have to rely
heavily on incoming treshmen in

, hopes that they have had some
