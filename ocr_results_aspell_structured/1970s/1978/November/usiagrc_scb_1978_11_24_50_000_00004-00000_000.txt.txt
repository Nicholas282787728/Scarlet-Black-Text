THE NOVELIST began his Work
experienceiin Grinnell with what
amounted to a very non-literary
J0b~peeltng potatoes at a small
restaurant in town called the
Grinncll Kitchen. The experience
made a lasting impression on Hall.
and he describes the proprietor of
the “Kitchen" as a “pot-bellied
man with close set eyes, and
always with two or three days'
growth or heard on his greasy
face.”

After his graduation in 1910 Hall
left Grinnell and his illustrious
career in potatoes to become a
social worker in Boston. He Worked
With the Boston Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children.
In 1914 he Ieit his job, vying instead
[or bicycle travels through Great
Britain.

WHEN WORLD WAR I began in
Europe Hall joined the British
Expeditionary Force and became
a machine gunner in France. He
returned home late in 1915 and
Joined the US. air service when the
US. entered the war, While serr
Ving, Hall was shot down and taken
prisoner by the Germans.

Hall‘s military experiences
proved worthwhile in promoting
his career as a novelist, as he was
commissioned, along with Charles
Nordho“, to write a book about
American volunteer airmen serr
ving with the French during the
war. in 1920 these two authors
published their first coauthored
novel,1‘hc Laiayette Flying Corps.

AFTER A shortelivcd career in
military writing, both Hall and
Nordhoii “went native" and
moved to Tahiti to pursue their
careers as novelists. They co-
authored many books during the
1920‘s, but they had no real success
until 19112 with the publication of
Mutiny on the Bounty.

Hall and Nordhotf co-authored a
total of 12 books while in Tahiti.
During Hall‘s solo career he
published an additional 17 books,

't\vo plays and numerous stories

and essays, including the best
selling antirwar novel, Lost Island.
He also did what amounted to a
great deal of correspondence,
writing frequently to a number of
Grinnell professors.

The elfect Grinnell College had
on Hall’s works remains unknown
Yet no one can doubt that his
literature has filled the thoughts
and Imaginations of his readers
with images of beautiful, faraway
places and romantic characters.
Undoubtedly, these images were
Conceived in a place other than
Grinnell,
