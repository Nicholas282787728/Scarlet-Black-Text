,Hess: Goldwater to New Left

by Bob Mitcncll

He says he lives by barter, wants
to establish highly decentralized
neighborhood governments and
developed a respect tor the
working class after he left the
Republican Party,

But Karl Hess. who once wrote
speeches for Barry Goldwater's ill~
fated presidential bid, says he
hasn’t changed his views very
much since 1964.

“l HAVEN'T changed too many
of my basic positions or
preierences..,l think the most
basic one is responsibility. I iavor
responsibility over rights~I think
rights are an illusion."

Hess appeared on campus as

part of a lecture program in honor .

of political science proiessor Ed
Gilmour, who is retiring at the end
of this semester. Hess has worked
as a press editor ior Newsweek, as
a welder and has coauthored the
book Neighborhood Power. which

outlines his vision of neighborhood
autonomy.

TODAY IIE LIVES in Berkeley
County. w. Va , where he says he
welds, writes and belongs to a
group interested in appropriate
technology.

After Goldwater's crushing
defeat in 1964, Hess lived in a boat
on the Anacostia River in Washing l
ton, D.C., where he and hlS neighr
bors did salvage work “and all
things that can be associated with
living on the water.”

HE THEN MOVED to a
Washington neighborhood, where
he became active in community
organizing.

He owns virtually no property
today, he says, because the In-
ternal Revenue Service placed a
100 per cent lien on his property in
1966, when he got “pissed off” and
refused to pay his taxes.

NOW HE EXISTS ”largely by '
barter." he says, “and I get small

Federal drug
inquiry in Iowa

An investigation by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics into the use
’ and sale of drugs at Cornell College and the University of Iowa is
- apparently under way, according to a recent article in the Cor-
nellian. The investigation might also extend to other colleges in the
Cornell region. the article states. The information about the in
vestigation was acquired by Susan Green Crim, dean of students at
Cornell and former assistant dean here.

Green Crim denied that the College has been contacted by any
federal agents have been on the Cornell campus. Assismnt Dean
Susie Wittpenn, who has talked with Green Crim, says that at
present it does not look as if the investigation will extend to Grins
nell. She adds that the investigation centers on dealers of hard
drugs.

amounts of cash, They could send
me to jail . . .but that just means
they get to feed me tor a year.

“When I was working they took
three paychecks in a row, 1 said,
‘that doesn't leave me a helluva lot
to live on,‘ They said, ‘we don’t
care.’ And I think that‘s proper.
After all, Why should thieves
care?”

HESS OWNS “no car, no nothing.
I built a house recently, a really
fabulous house. I don’t own it, but I
live in it.

“I believe people should carry
their own weight,” he adds. “I just
don‘t think the federal govern-

ment is doing anything that needs

doing."

HESS SAYS HE has absolutely
no regrets about his involvement in
the Goldwater campaign and
would do it again “under those
circumstances."

But, he adds, “I would introduce
a much more skeptical attitude
about the national security
state . . . It lthe campaign) just
accepted it. That was a dreadful
mistake."

HE SAYS HE inserted the now
infamous phrase “extremism in
defense of liberty is no vice;
moderation in the pursuit of justice
is no virtue” into Goldwater’s
acceptance speech at the 1964
Republican convention, but adds
that he didn't “dream it up,"
People were irightened by it, he

 

says, because they “derive from
what you say what they want to
hear.”

Goldwater, says Hess. “could
have got up and said ‘apple pie‘
and people would say, ‘He‘s
threatening to bomb the world with
apple pies.’ I don’t see why anyone
should be scared of the words.

”AS A REPUBLICAN, I had
always been involved in the notions
that working people are the enemy,
that they are greedy, that great
institutions are required to keep
them in line," he says, But his

experience as a Welder changed his
feelings. “I discovered whenI went
to work this is not true . . . I never
had an opportunity to investigate
this when I was in politics." He
first conceived of neighborhood
government while he worked as a
welder.

Hess prefers community got/cm-
ment to national government
because accountability is greater
at the local level. “If a community
makes a decision that's a bad
decision, the community should
bear the responsibility.”

Witness the fall of Nixon and Lear

by Larry Pindcr
No one really knew what to
expect from Alan Pakula’s 1m
film version of Woodward and
Bernstein’s All the President‘s
Men. The politicallysminded
worried that the film might
sacrifice integrity to entertain-
ment. Others were concerned that
what they saw as a thriller, a
detective story. might be hams
pered by editorial. -
Obviously, Pakula had a thin lin
to tread. Pakula’s quiet style,
however, treads that line nimbly.
Political statement is restrained;
the audience hardly needed to be
told who the villains of the piece
were. Instead of becoming the
diatribe against Nixon's crew it
could have been, the work is a
newspaper story or the best kind.
ROBERT REDFORD as
Woodward and Dustin Hoffman as
Bernstein perform brilliantly and
are supported by some of the finest
actors working in film. Jack
Warden plays the; Washington
Post's city editor and Martin
Balsam appears as Howard
Simons, Post managing editor,
As Ben Bradlee, Jason Robards
turns in a small but rousing per-
formance, and Hal Holbrook does
the impossible by bringing “Deep
Throat,” the reporters’ inside
source, to credible life. Robert
Walden plays Donald Segretti,
dirty trickster with the Committee
to ReElect the President, and
Jane Alexander quietly plays the

one committee employee willing to

ALSO DESERVING Credit for

the film’s success is Gordon Willis,
cinematographerJ-lis decision to
shoot scenes in the Post newsroom
to add deep vision was a line one.
We see principals moving .and
acting with extras, providinga
backdrop to the foreground drama,
whic nds greatly to the film’s
credi y.
Willis's photography, in comr
bination with Pakula’s subtle
handling of his actors, makes this
one of the subtlest films of recent
years to attract the general
public‘s attention.

PRODUCING Shakespeare’s
King Lear has troubled the
theatrical and literary worlds
almost since the play's iirst per-
formances. Even recent literary
critics say the play is better ap-
preciated through reading than
performance. This weekend’s
second film is a 1971 version of the

play by Peter Brook, based on a
Royal Shakespeare Company
production he directed nearly a
decade earlier,

Brook's version is based on the
notion that Lear is an absurd
drama, almost like the plays of
Beckett. Values of the Middle Ages
and the Renaissance have
disintegrated; nearly everyone in
the play, good and evil, dies by the
final scene. and the two most
important. Lear and his daughter
Cordelia, who reiuses in the play's
opening to use rhetoric to express
her filial love, die to no end
whatsoever. By the time of his
death Lear has been reduced to an

l almost clown-like state.

Paul Schoiield plays Lear well,
and the restoi the cast is composed
of such British actors as Jack
McGowran, irene North, Alan
Webb, Cyril Cusack and Patrick
Magee. The film was shot in Den-
mark.
