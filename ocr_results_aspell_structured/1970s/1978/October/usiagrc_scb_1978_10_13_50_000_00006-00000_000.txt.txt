Film festival devoted
to Altman’s work

by Michael Greenﬁeld V
in keeping with past tradition,
this weekend brings the year's lirst
film festival This particular
festival celebrates directorial
achievement. oiiering three
marvelous works by Robert Alt-
man Each film is different. but tlle
common denominator \Kl‘IICh
connotes superb film IS. indeed. the
directorial genius of Robert Alt-
man.

l’m sure that in one way or»
another everyone has some
knowledge of M‘A'Sﬁll (1910).
However, lor those oi you who
haven’t, a little inside information
should help,

JUST AS conventional war
movies find the action in the
shooting, M‘A's'll, a military
acronym for Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital. finds it in the bleeding,
The film has solved the major
problems in dealing with war and
soldiers by going iull iorce with the
insanity. It's excruciatingly
humorous, yet it magically retains
a sense of what is sane and
precious in life; namely, life.
MM is much more than a one-
joke comedy, and the audience can
easily spot that the genuine lunacy
here is the war. .

Donald Sutherland and Elliott
Gould play brilliantly together in a
sly, easy camaraderie oi men who
love life too much to live it by in
fantile rules. Equally brilliant is a
complementary duet of ianatics
played by Robert Duvall and Sally
Kellerman. He's a religious nut
and chief surgeon and she's an
army nut and chief nurse. Their
seduction scene is as funny as
anything you’ll ever see in a movie.
But because one could go on in
definitely about funny business in
this movie, I’ll end with nothing
more than a see it‘,

CALIFORNIA SPLIT t1974) is a
lilm about gamblers, portrayed by
George Segal and the lovable
Elliott Gould. The characters
Suffer the fierce loneliness that
Altman perceives in American life
This film is implacable and
menacing. It is sometimes very
iunny although the underlying

 

mood is sober.

The gamblers’ numerous conr
Versations crowd the film with

world ni gambling and oi gamblers

where even the toasters have gone

ELLlOTT GOULU'S
l'ormance is periect,
disguises a lonely iace
gregarious ape's mask;
loneliness is concealed under a
cloud oi buiioonery Although i
didn‘t really enjoy this film the
first time I saw it. the second
viewing yielded extremely positive
results, as it should ior you.

Three Women is Robert Altr
man’s most personal film. as it is
the transposition of a dream Alt-
man had about two girls who meet
in a mysterious collision oi emp-
tiness. It’s the same dream of the
vast American wasteland that
disturbs so many dreamers, Alt-
man turns it into a beautriul poem
of horrified Compassion. He takes
the bleakest visions and
paradoxically transforms them so
that they are ablaze with light to
Stir us into the exhilaration of
discovery,

IllS DREAM 0F three women
expresses his sense that humans
have become more vulnerable than
ever to pain, loss and betrayal.
The iilm has an originality and
beauty of form that moves you
beyond the iorce oi its insight.

The three main characters
display acting at its deepest level.
They range irom the twisted in»
nocence oi Sissy Spacek. to the
haunted, prophetic beauty of
Janice Rule. to Shelley Duvall,
whose utter sweetness turns
grotesque under the sun, Although
I know some people have a
passionate dislike for this film, 1
highly recommend it, even though
my credibility might deteriorate,
but. what the hell .

Note: Three Women will be
shown tonight at7215 pm In ARl-l,
not 9:30 in South Lounge as
scheduled for Friday night.

Russian films offer insights

by Jeff Meisles

So what it you can’t pronounce
the 47 names that you hear in the
first five minutes of an Eastern
European film? With the iollowing
information you can amaze and
enlighten your iriends with your
scholarliness and enjoy the movies
which have been brought to
campus by the committee on
Russian and East European
Studies

In an effort to inform Grinnell
students of the many intricacies oi
Eastern European culture, the
committee is presenting a special
program on the Soviet and East
European cinema

THE Fler’lS AFFORD students
a unique opportunity to see many
films not normally available for
screening. For instance. next
Thursday. Katina Kl'ilsnaia tThe
Red Snowball Trcc) will be shown
at9:30p m. at the Grinnell Cinema
free of charge The movie has
never been commercially released
outside of the Soviet Union, and is
available in the United States only
in “university circles."

The film deals with a member of
Russian organized crime who
attempts to “go Straight“ by
returning to a simple rural life, and
ends up warding oii attacks by his
former associates from ”the
mob.” According to the description
which accompanies the film, the
movie provides “unusual insights
into the seamy world oi petty
hoodlums and the superstitions
filled rural existence of con-
temporary Soviet villages."

THE WORLD OF Russian film
making is as interesting as the
films themselves. For instance. the
Soviet government does not like to
admit that there is a crime
problem in Russia, and the
production oi Knlina Krasnaia was
allowed only because the director,
Vassili Shukshin. was well-liked by
Brezhnev.

of Shadows oi Forgotten An-
cestors. the first Russian film
shown this year, has not been as
favored by me government. He is
now in jail. The official charge
against him is homosexuality, but
it is more likely that Russian of-
iicials were tired of trying to
censor Paradyhanov‘s outspoken
opinions

GOVERNMENT censoring also
plays a large part in many oi the
films produced in Russia, ac
cording to Russian proiessor
Harley Balzer. Russian citizens
are not permitted to see scenes
containing sex or religion. Since
these commodities are not taboo to
Western audiences, Western
versions of Soviet films are often
censored far less than the versions
available commercmlly in Russia.
For instance, Russian audiences
viewing Andrei Rublcv did not see
the pagan orgy included in the
version shown at Grilinell, Also a
four-part version of The idiot iust
finished production, and while
Westerners will see all four parts.
Russians will see only the less

 

controversial two parts.

One tip in watching the films,
according to Balzer. is to “pay
special attention to symbolism and
Cultural values, but don’t drive
yourself crazy trying to follow the
plot. Some of these films are art
films and don't have logical plots."
This should not detract from their
appeal, however, because they
offer iascinating insights into
Eastern cultural values.

SO FAR, large turnouts have
shown that students are generally,
appreciating the films, although
comments on them range from
“they stink" to “they‘re great."

These films, a combination of
both recent and classic works,
offer students an unusual opr
portunily to see him not normally
available to_American audiences,
gain an understanding oi Eastern
European cultural values, and
spenda night away irom the books.
in iuture weeks, more attention
will be paid to films of East
European countries other than
Russia.
