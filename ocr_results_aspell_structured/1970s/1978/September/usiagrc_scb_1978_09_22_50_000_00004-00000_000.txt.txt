Campus warning system

should be implemented

It’s a bit ironic—not to mention selfish—to talk about
luck when one discusses the tragedy that hit the Grinnell
community last Saturday. Six people are dead. businesses
have, been destroyed and other property has been
demolished.

The tragedy. however. could have been a lot Worse. What
if the tornado had swept through the main business district
or residential area of Grinnell or through the campus? In this
respect it was lucky that many times more people were not
killed or seriously injured.

THE POSSIBILITY of the event should be considered~
tornadoes are an allrtoo-common phenomenon in Iowa. The
present campus warning system for such a Calamity is sorely
inadequate. Even if the warning sirens had gone off in town
and on campus. are there many people who would have
known what to do? The answer is no. Throughout the storm,
people partied. played in the rain and stayed in places which
were potential death sites. Perhaps it was even fortunate
that the campus sirens did not go off because many people
might have panicked or simply waited in bewilderment.

In fact, there is no campus warning procedure or plan of
safety action in the event of a tornado or other such disaster.

This situation is not only dangerous but also inexplicable. .

To wait for a disaster to occur is ridiculous. We now know
that this is not a trivial issue or an impossibility. The
Student Affairs office should come up with some ideas as
soon as possible.

ONE RELATIVELY simple solution would be to instruct
SA's during workshops on how to handle such a situation.
RA’s, too. should have a plan of action for alerting students
and getting them to safety. Instructions should be posted in
all dorms regarding what to do in the case of an emergency.
Presently, only directions for safety in case of fire are posted
in the dorms.

Last Tuesday night a potential crisis occurred again.
Tornadoes were sighted in nearby towns. This time people in
some dorms were instructed by RA's to wait in dorm
basements until the storm warnings were over. Some people
took this seriously; others did not. People in Burling sat ill
the basement for half an hour waiting for the storm to
subside. Still. some people remained oblivious to the

potential danger or chose not to heed the warnings.

HAVING A FORMAL warning procedure that tells
students what to do and where to go will make everybody
more aware of the severity of the situation. Perhaps the
warning will have enough of an effect that the often stubborn
and unhelpful student will not mind Sitting in an
inhospitable basement or pit for half an hour or so.

We suggest that a campus warning system and safety
procedure plan be drawn up as soon as possible. As
melodramatic and fatalistic as it may sound. if nothing is
done the next time may be too late.
