Gasp! Grinnell gridders glorifiedgame

by Nancy Gould

“Athletic sports have played an
important part in the development
of Sturdy citizens that Grinnell has
sent to all parts of the World . . .”
The Cyclone, 1903.

Though not exactly a current
belief among Grinnell students,
during the late 1800's that motto
reflected a prevalent feeling on the
Grinnell Campus. Perhaps the
popularity of this sentiment was
inﬂuenced by Grinnell's football
teams of the late 19th century,
which struck fear in the hearts of
rivals throughout the Midwest.
Grinnell was once the undisputed
football powerhouse of Iowa,

FOOTBALL furor emerged on
campus sometime during the early
1880’s, when college iootball ivas
beginning at the Ivy League
schools on the East Coast. Grin-
nell’s newspaper, The Pulse.
urged the students on campus to
organize a team and learn the
game that was so popular in the
East. The school resisted until late
in 1889, when a few students “sent
for a ball” and organized the first
Grinnell football team.

Training immediately began for
Grinnell’s first contest, which was
to be played against the awesome
Iowa City team, then referred to as
the State University of Iowa.
Spirits were high for the game, but
the campus was not overly con»
fident with their new team, In
order to boost team moral, the
school paper again did its best to
encourage the Grinnell players by
printing the following: “we have
balls, we have grounds laid out . , .
cheer up, boys—there’s hope,”

THE DAY of the game finally
arrived. Crowds of fans travelled

In EB Focus

 

to Grinnell to see the game. Iowa
City fans overflowed with con
fidence. The crowd claimed they
came to Grinnell “to bag a few
cornfield canaries.” The fans from
Iowa City were undoubtedly
shocked when the ”Canaries" from
Grinnell won the game by an
impressive 2470 score. This game,
incidentally, gave Grinnell the
state championship for that year.

Needless to say. the Iowa City
team was not content with its loss,
so a rematch was scheduled for the
following year. Again Grinnell

, bested lowa City, by a score of res.

This victory initiated Grinnell's
reputation as a football terror.

BY 1892, Grinnell's football team
had become quite a powerhouse in
the Midwest, thrashing opponents
in nearly every game. One of the
team’s most notable performances
came against another influential
team from Iowa. Although the
competition was tough, Grinnell
was too much for the Des Moines
YMCA. Grinnell solidly defeated
the men from Des Moines by a 132-
0 margin.

With such an outstanding season
to reflect upon. Grinnell met Iowa
City for another rematch in 1893,
Again Grinnell was victorious, by
the score of 36-14, However, the
Victory celebration was short-
lived, as the game was “marred by
an unfortunate event,” While
“ladies and gentlemen" from Iowa
City carried a banner through
Grinnell, one Iowa City Woman
was struck by a Grinnell student.
The event was called “an uns
pardonable outrage” and it in-
creased bitterness between the
schools.

IOWA City played another game

I

 

with Grinnell during 1894, The
game was close. with the two
teamstied lz-lz early in the second
hall. Then a Grinnell player
snatched the ball from an Iowa
back and ran, “unnoticed," for a
touchdown. tEvidently he was
quite thin)

Eventually the Iowa City team
discovered the sneak touchdown,
lmmediatelv surrounded the
referee and successfully convmced
him that the ball had been downed
before the score, Despite bitter
complaints from the Grinnell
team, the referee insisted that the
touchdown had not been made.
Grinnell then left the field, for-
feiting the game.

AFTER the lamous “downed
ball” incident. Grinnell refused a
rematch with Iowa City during
1898. Instead Grinnell’s schedule
was increased to include other
teams that were not quite as well
known as Iowa City. One of
Grinnell’s heartbreaking losses
came at the hands of Deane
College, by a score of 5-0. Grins
nell's strategy in this game was
described as “a weak developed
attack of swell head.” It was not
until the last few minutes that
Grinnell “realized that Deane had
a points.” It was reported that
“more than one stout athlete gave
vent to his grief and shame in
tears," after this traumatic loss.

Grinnell’s final rival of the 1300's
was Drake University, which
Grinnell played during the 1899
season. Armed with exceptionally
clever insults. such as claims that
Drake “didn't know the difference
between a noseguard and a touch

‘down," Grinnell began the game,

The amazing wit of the students,

however, was no indication of their
athletic prowess and the iron
gridmen of Grinnell were drubbed
42-0, _

THAT same year Grinnell faircd
well against other teams that are
well known today. Grinnell
defeared the University of
Nebraska 12b, the University of
Pennsylvania 23-5, and tied the

ask about those 5’s: scoring was
different back then I H

In l500, a drastic change took
place in Grinnell‘s pattern of
victories over “name” schools.
During this year Grinnell suffered
a momentous loss to Iowa
University, 5272.

SIMILARLY mediocre seasons
were played until 1909, when
Grinnell devised an ingenious
system for securing victories,
Rather than constructing a new
game plan, Grinnell simply altered
the calibre of the teams it played,
This season saiv two impressive
victories for Grinnell~one against
East Des Moines High School and
the second, a 63-0 victory over that
Midwestern legend, Newton High
School.

Subsequent seasons proved
equally difficult for Grinnell, The
Coach of the 1911 team “realized
early in the season that a number
of men did not understand the
fundamentals of the game," which
-may have posed major difficulties
on the playing field. By 1914 it was
Ievident that Grinnell players were
still having minor problems with
those fundamentals and during the
season Grinnell was defeated by .
Carleton 6370, by Coe 85-0 and by
Monmouth 7570,

OBVIOUSLY, Grinrlell's status
as a great football school had
changed drastically by the dismal
season of 1914. Though few football
seasons since have produced as
many substantial defeats, Grinnell
has never been able to match the
stunning victories ofthe late 1800's.
The school must currently be
content with digging up old records
and dwelling on those days when

OK.

So what
technology?

Appropriate technology refers to
technologies thatiare small scale,
low cost and worker controlled,
technologies that protect the en-
vironment, fit into esmblished
cultural patterns and meet the
basic needs of people. Examples
include simple farm machines,
solar heating systems, windmills,
waste recycling systems, and
scaled-down industrial processes.

But appropriate technology
(A.’I‘,) is not merely the
technologies; it is also the
philosophy that underlies them, It
is the belief that a new social order
is possible in which man has
control of the technological
processes which provide for his
basic needs in the best way
possible for society and the en-
vironment.

PROPDNENTS of what is called
low-cost technology, intermediate
technology. soft technology,
correct technology or A.T,, are
disillusioned with the modern
technological order.

Once upon a time it seemed as it
bigger could only be better and
that the increasing scale and ef»
ficiency of our modern
technologies could only improve

is appropriate

man’s condition on earth. But
disillusionment has grown about
life in industrialized societies and
about foreign aid to developing
countries, causing what many
term the appropriate technology
movement.

ITS advocates are challenging
the traditional values of growth,

efficiency and large scale
production. “Their aim is to give
individuals some choice of the way
in which they will live, to give
communities choices in the
solution of local problems, and to
give nations further choices in
their development schemes,"
slates William N. Ellis in En-
vironmental Conservation.

The late E.F. Schumacher,
author of Small is Beautiful, whose
,works have been instrumental in
‘popularizing the idea of ap-

propriate, or as he calls it, in-‘

termediate technology. en-
courages an emphasis on self»
reliance and decentralization.

HE TERMS Western cultures

polarized," and encourages the
development of small towns. He
calls for appropriate technology to
fit into his Small framework,

But Schumacher emphasizes
that decentralization should not
only be concerned with technology,
but also with the organizational
structure of communities. In
termediate technology should
apply to health care and the
education system, both of which he
believes have become large,
complex and often unresponsive to
human needs.

BUT A back to the Stone Age or
Garden of Eden movement is not
what proponents of AT. are ad-
vocating. They are not claiming
that all large scale technology is
bad. They are trying to provide a
complement to, rather than a
substitute for, modern technology,
Nicholas Jequier explains in Ap-
propriate Technology: Problems
and Promises.

GROUPS in Western countries
and in developing countries are
working to develop such alter-
native technologies. At a
Washington state prison farm the
Ecotope Group built a methane
system which will convert the
waste of 350 dairy cows into
methane gas, which will be used to
save more than $10,000 a year in
the cost of fuel and fertilizer,

Reliance in Washington, D.C., has

found that with rooftop gardens,
basement agriculture, waste
composting and solar energy, a
city block can become nearly in»
dependent for both food and
energy,” Ellis reports in the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists.

IN THE Philippines, an en-
trepreneur built up a starch
separation plant using $10,000
worth of second-hand washing
machines as his only equipment.
“The efficiency of his plant was so
great, and his production costs so
competitive, that the ‘efficient’ one
and a half million dollar plant set
up in the same region had to be'
closed down,” Jequier states in
