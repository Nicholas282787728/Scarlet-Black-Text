reassignment is technically
possible if circumstances call to:
it.

HOWEVER, WALKER said in a
meeting with some players and
others Sunday morning~a
meeting called to inform Walker of
the Situation—that Peterson would
remain as coach for the duration of
the Season.

Walker said in a later interview
it was too early to speculate on
possible options for next year.
Plitsch said that if plaver
dissatisfaction remained at the end
of the year, a recommendation
from him to Walker that Peterson
be reassigned is “a possiblity”.

Between the Thursday and
Sunday meetings, many players
decided they did not want to quit.
By then, many were convinced that
quitting would accomplish very
little. Also, Kingma noted that “a
big reason we decided not to quit
was that we love to play basket
ball.”

A MAJOR PLAYER Complaint
was that Peterson had not
established satisfactory com-
munications with the team.
Players often thought Peterson
iailed to tally publicize and explain
starting lineup selections and
game substitutions

One player said. ”The day before
the game there was no idea who’d
be playing."

The rational tor Peterson's
decisions was not Selfrevideilt,
many players said. Tony Whitaker,
who quit last Semcster, Said, “My
main problem was trying to “I?
derstand what he was doing and
why." Several players
acknowledged that they thought
Peterson often inexplicably hen»
ched players performing well.

MANY PLAYERS said the
communications problem was
linked to poor player-coach rap-
port. which was another major
player complaint Whitaker said
Peterson “wouldn‘t open up, . .He

It " Another commented, “He was
not very friendly. He was kind of
cold.”

Players also complained about
pregame talks of questionable
benefit, boring practice sessions
that failed to use time as produc-
tIvely as possible, poor use of time-
outs during games, and iailure to
use praise to build team conﬁdence
and spirit.

AT LEAST five players who quit
the team during the course of the
season said that dissatlstactlun
with Peterson was partially, it not
totally, their reason for quitting

Peterson said. “It complaints in
general are heartfelt then they’re
valid. Whether or not they are
justified is a matter of question I
believe they (the players) really
felt they.had some complaints “

ABOUT THE complaint
regarding communication,
Peterson said, “There was no at
tempt on my part not to coins
municate.” He added, however,
that in some Specific instances last
semester he did not communicate

“One oi my errors was that I was

someone why he starts one game
