Baby's Arms"

Lester Flatt, rolling into Grinnell
for two shows tomorrow night at 8
and 9:30 pm. in South Lounge. is
one of the most important artists in
the history of country music.

in the course oi his career, Flatt
has been directly involved with
some of the most prominent artists
in bluegrass music, such as Bill
Monroe and Earl Scruggs. With
these men, Flatt actively par-
ticipated in both the creation of the
bluegrass idiom and in
popularizing it throughout the
country.

_FLATT'S involvement with
country music began in the late
1930's. During this period, he
played semi»professionally in
many small, “old-timey" string
bands in eastern Tennessee and
western Virginia.

When he joined ”Bill Monroe and
His Blue Grass Boys” in 1945, Flatt
became active in a revolutionary
new style of country music.
Monroe, whose band featured a
particularly hard-driving, up~
tempo sound that was unique in
country music, had a young banjo
picker from North Carolina named
Earl Scruggs, whose unusual
three-finger picking style became
the trademark oi bluegrass music.
During his three year tenure wim
Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys,
Flatt coauthored with Monroe
many bluegrass standards, such as
”Will You Be Lovin' Another
Man,” “Sweetheart You Done Me
Wrong,“ and “Cabin on the Hill."

As developed by Monroe,
“bluegrass” music has several
distinct characteristics. In-
strumentally, it features a banjo,
ilddle, mandolin, and a guitar,
although some groups have
dropped both the mandolin and
fiddle. Vocal arrangements in
bluegrass are performed by duets
or trios. The most important
characteristic oi bluegrass,
however, is that it |S played on
acoustic instruments without the
benefit of percussion,

BOTH FLATT and Scruggs
stayed with Monroe until 1943,
when the hectic traveling schedule
maintained by the Blue Grass Boys
proved too wearisome. Flatt
joined Scruggs to form “Lester
Flatt, Earl Scruggs, and the Foggy
Mountain Boys,” one of the most
important bands in country music.

The Foggy Mountain Boys were
an immediate success in the
Southeast. Along with such
emerging groups as the Stanley
Brothers, Jim and Jesse and the
Virginia Boys, and Don Reno and
Red Smiley and the Tennessee
Cutups, the Foggy Mountain Boys
helped popularize the new form of
string band music which they
learned from Monroe. Because of
Scruggs‘s reputation and banjo
ability, the Foggy Mounmin Boys
emerged as the most popular
bluegrass band in the country.

THE POPULARITY oi the band
was reinforced in 1953, when they
signed a contract widi Martha
White Mills, a ﬂour company, to do
an early morning radio show on
WSM of Nashville. By January,
1955, they began a syndicated
television show for Martha White,
and had become members ot the
Grand Ole Opry.

Flatt and Scruggs also benefited

American folk music that emerged

something “any other part of the
.economy" would do in order to
achieve a fair return in the
marketplace. Boyle believes that
the AAM has a good deal of tacit
approval throughout Iowa.

JOHN Kopsa. an area farmer
who was interviewed last week,
conceded that “it is hard to tell how
big" AAM is in lowa, Kopsa
commented, however, that there is
a general consensus among [are
mers that some action needs to be
taken to alleviate the poor
economic conditions. Kopsa, like
Boyle, cited the need for organized
action by farmers.

“All types of farmers are in-
volved in that they all agree that
something needs to,he done.
Farmers traditionally have had a
hard time sticking together. Right
now, though, every other part of
the economy is organized except
the farmers. The new generation of
farmers realize the need for united
action more than their fathers
did,” he said.

Maynard Raiiety, a local farmer
and member of the National
Farmers Organization, (NFO),
commented in a private interview
that he is skeptical whether the
AAM will have any lasting,
measurable success. Raliety was

 

quick to enumerate the short run
benelits garnered by a movement
of AAM’s intensity.

“lT (the strike) has stirred up
publicity, and certainly has got a
few more people thinking. But its
accomplishmenm will probably be
minimal.H he said.

Railety saw a future [or we per

range, organized, carelul plan
ning. He made it clear that all
farmers, regardless ol their
organizational loyalty, were
sympathetic to the idea of parity.

“BUT T0 get parity price,
farmers must pool their talents. If
thirty per cent oi all farmer
produce could be sold through one
marketing agency, then, and only
then, could 100 per cent parity be
ascertained.” he said.

According to Boyle, the AAM is
needed because “formal
organizations," such as the NFO,
“have not done their job."

RAFFETY. however. sees the
NFO playing an important role in
theAachievement at 100 per cent
parity.

“The NFO has been involved in
collective bargaining (or twenty
years now. Progress has been slow
because it takes time to change

among Northern urbanita in the

pearance at the Newport Folk
Festival, a writer for the New York
Times praised the “brilliant
bluegrass instrumentals" of the
duo and compared Scruggs to
Paganini.

THE FOGGY Mountain Boys
achieved real commercial success
in 1952, when Paul Henning,
producer of the program “The
Beverly Hillbillies," asked them to
record the show‘s theme. Their

charts in the early months of 19$:

came in 1968, when the group‘s 1948

DESPITE THE differing per-

certain that the American farmer

Boyle Tuesday night, when he

in the movie Bonnie and Clyde. By
1969, they were Columbia Records'
second most popular country are
tists. Only Johnny Cash sold more
records than they did.

Flatt and Scruggs leit an i
delible mark on bluegrass music.
Many of their recordings, such as
”Roll in My Sweet Baby’s Arms,"
“Salty Dog Blues," ”Orange
Blossom Special," and “Foggy
Mountain Breakdown” have
become bluegrass standards. In
addition, the group was technically
innovative. In the mid-fifties,
Scruggs developed tuning pegs
which allow a banjo-picker to
accurately retune the banjo while
playing. This produces a peculiar
slide effect which adds an unusual
dimension to the banjo. The group
was also the first bluegrass group
to include a dobro, an openrtlmed,
unamplilied guitar which bears a

resemblance to a steel guitar.

1N llltifl, Flatt and Scruggs broke
up, One of the major reasons ior
this split was that. in the midst of
their greatest popularity, the
sound ol the Foggy Mountain Boys
had changed No longer were they
a bluegrass band in the strict sense
of the term, As they had become
more and more popular, the Foggy
Mountain Boys began to periorm a
wide array of nonrbluegrass,
“folk" material, ranging from
works by Dylan to Leadhelly. They
had also begun using a number of
non-bluegrass instruments in their
group, such as the harmonica and
the twelvestnng guitar, Flatt.
according to critic Ncil Rosenberg,
“was not comfortable” with this
new [olkrrock material. Scruggs,
on the other hand, wanted to ex»
periment with more non-bluegrass
idioms.

Since that time, Flatt has
returned to more traditional
bluegrass forms. His current
sevenepiece band, the Nashville
Grass, is large for a bluegrass
group. It is reminiscent of the
Foggy Mountain Boys in that its
repertoire includes many old Flatt
and Scruggs standards, And its
personnel has included former
Foggy Mountain Boys, including
dobro player “Uncle Josh”
Graves, current tenor and guitar
player Curly Seckler, and the late
fiddle player Paul Warren.

THE BAND currently has two
noteworthy instrumentalists.
Kenny lngraham, the banjo
player, is an extremely quick and
competent picker. In addition to
lngraham, there is Marty Stuart, ‘a

'remarkable ZD—yeariold mandolin

and guitar picker from
Philadelphia, Mississippi.

With this band, Flatt is helping
maintain and preserve the
bluegrass sound with which he has

been so closely associated.
