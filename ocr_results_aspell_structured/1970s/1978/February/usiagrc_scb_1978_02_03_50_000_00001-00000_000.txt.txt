Class size an issue

By Dan Blum

Underenrollment in many upper
level classes has created the
problem of maintaining an even
level of distribution in class size
without compromising the liberal
arts orientation of the college

A study conducted by Dean
Waldo Walker indicates that there
has been a general trend towards
lowered enrollment in many two
and three hundred level courses.
Figures for 1975 and 1in showed
that 109 per cent of all classes
contained five students or less, and
38.4 per cent contained under ten:
The survey for 1977, however,
showed a reduction in classes of
less than ten students, indicating
that the trend may have (em,
porarily slowed or completed its
development. ,

WALKER identified several
departments that have been
particularly afflicted. Certain
upper level biology and physics
courses have frequently suffered,
as have the classical languages
and the upper level modern
languages.

Beryl E. Clotfelter, physics
department chairman,
acknowledged mat many of the

 

Nevertheless, underenrollment
in the upper courses can lead to
overenrollment in the lower»level
offerings. suggesting that many
courses may not be operating at
their optimal size. Turner,
however, feels that any across-the
board reduction in upper-level
classes would be undesirable,

“A VERY important point is that
if we get into a numbers game
syndrome, we_would be doing a
disservice to the major. 0n the
other hand, each department
should ask itself if it is designing
the most efficient spectrum of
offerings; whether a particular
course is necessary,“ he said.

THE question of whether a
course is necessary to a major
raises more problems. Clotfelter
commented,.“fn the physics
department we have been able to
cut all but the essential courses
because we are aware of graduate
requirements. But these
requirements would be more
difficult to determine in other
fields, such as English or some
social sciences, because their
graduate programs are much less
smndardized.”

The administration plays a

quite small. He added, “We have
some chemistry and math majors,
but generally the size of our classes
reﬂects the number of physics
majors.”

SOME departments seem
not to have been affected. For
example, Professor Peter Connelly
of the English department claims
that “I have observed ﬂuctuations
in the level of enrollment in some
courses, but I can't detect any
trend whatsoever." President
Turner commented that “I don’t

it, “The departments staff their
semester any way they want. i
personally think there are too
many underenrolled courses, but
as long as the departments wish to

them a lot of ﬂak.”

HE mentioned several
possibilities for compromise. Some
courses could be taught in after
nate years, or have their various
sections combined. Yet such
measures must take into account
the varying levels of ﬂexibility
between different major
programs. Such'a solution would

Accepts presidency in Iran

Woman declines post

An assistant to the president of
Oberlin College, Carolyn spatta,
wholast week was reported to have
been offered the position of Vice
Provost and Affirmative Action
officer of the college; has declined
the position, the 5&3 learned. ,

Noting that Spatta was the
college's first choice, Dean Waldo
Walker, who is conducting the
search for the new Vice-Provost,
said that he was “very disap»
painted" with her decision to
decline.

ll Spatta had accepted the
college's offer, Walker observed,
she would have assumed the
position by the first of March.
“Now, I can’t possibly see anyone
coming in as Vice-Provost before
the first of May, possibly as late as
July,” he said.

Copy law

by Andrew Schultz

Warning,

The next time you plug a nickel
into the Xerox machine, you may
be breaking the law,

Students are probably aware of
the differences in their course
materials for this semester.
However, students, and teachers
as well, are probably unaware of
the full extent of the new copyright
laws, enacted January 1 of this
year. Anyone ignorant of the laws
may become an unwitting violator
of them.

THE NEW laws were drafted to
restrict the massive and
unregulated copying of materials
that was taking place in every
educational institution in the
country,

Steve Pandolfo, assistant
librarian for administration,
described two conﬂicting interests
affected by the law: the interests of
the authors, and those ‘of
educators.

PRIOR TO the law, authors and
publishers of books, journals, and
other materials had their works
copied without permission,
Royalty payments were not being
paid for the copied materials.

Pandolfo mentioned one case of
the abuse of an author’s copyright
A large state school had taken a

'book, copied it in its entirety, and

then had it rebound, The “new”
book was sold in the school
bookstore for a marked-up price.
But, Pandolfo insists, this type of
ﬂagrant abuse is an exception.

THE interests of educators are
also at stake under the new law.
Teachers have the need to pull
materials together from diverse
sources. Often, no single book
exists that can cover the material
for such wide-ranging courses as
American Civilization or Medieval
and Renaissance Culture, In the
past, teachers have borrowed from
various sources in order to prevent
making students buy 50 books for a
single course, Copying was a
wonderful convenience for both
teacher and student.

The new lawis very complex and
vague, according to Pandolfo.

Spatta chose instead to accept
an offer from a small Presbyterian
school in Teheran, Iran Where she
will assume the office of president.

While the college received 65

applications for the position, as of
yet, only two candidates have been
brought to campus. The second
candidate, Kenneth Browning, an
associate dean at the
Massachusetts institute of
Technology (MITl, has not yet
been offered the Vice-Provost
position. Walker said that at this
point he is still unsure whether
Browning will be offered the
position or whether the college will
reopen the search.

Although the college's first
choice was a woman, Walker
would make no promises con-
cerning future candidates. Only

one other application was received
from a woman and Walker noted
that she ”doesn’t fit the job at all.”

The position of ViceProvoSt
became vacant last semester with
the resignation of William Barrett.
Walker is handling the duties of
ViceaProvost until a replacement
is found. William Demlnoff is
currently the school’s Affirmative
Action officerl

The position of Vice-Provost was
created by President Turner in his
1976 administrative
reorganization. The ViceProvost’s
particular concerns are budget
preparation, expenditure control,
personnel procedures, and direct
oversight of plant and service
units. The ViceProvost is also the
Affirmative Action officer of the
college.

poses problem

Trying to use copied materials in violation of the new copyright
law could he just as dangerous as trying to pass off these bills as the

real thing.

Basically, the law requires
teachers to ask permission of the
author or publisher, and pay
royalties if required, to copy parts
of books or journals.

DEAN Waldo Walker issued a
set of guidelines to professors last
month concerning the new law.
The guidelines were a con-
densation of the law as it affected
teachers, and were compiled by a
committee of authors, publishers,
educators, and members of the
House Judiciary Committee.

Under the guidelines, teachers
may make single copies of book
chapters, journal articles, short
stories, essays, poems, charts,

pictures, diagrams, and cartoons
from any source, as long as these
copies are only for individual use.

MULTIPLE copies for

classroom use may be made if
three criteria are met. These
criteria are, in effect, legal co ,
‘ditions. They are: brevit
,spontaneity, and cumulative er
lfect. If a teacher makes copies
that do not pass these legal tests,
then the teacher may be breaking
the copyright law.

Brevity means that copied
material may be no longer than 250
words for a poem; 2500 words (10
pages) for prose. No copy of any
