Barrett reports on minorities

hy Kathy Willhoite

Over winter break Vice~Frovost
and Affirmative Action Officer
William Barrett's status report on
women and minority employees at
Grinnell College was made public.

Issued to President Turner,
Dean Walker, and the faculty, the
report deals mainly with the status
of women and minorities in the
professional administrative smff
during the present 15177 a school
year. The report rile 'ons no
names, only the admi strative
rank, salary, sex, and minority-
majority status of each ad~
ministrator. ‘

ACCORDING TO the report,
“Of 48 administrators, 18 are
women including one minority, and
one is a male minority: none are
represented in the first two levels
where policy is presumably made.
Four of the women appear to be
underpaid based on salary,
longevity and responsib ty; one
man appears to be overpaid; the
President and the Dean promise
corrections for 1978-79 ”

Barrett utilized the ads
ministrative ranking system which
was developed by Dean Walker
and used by last year’s Affirmative
Action officer, Mary L, Eysenr
bach, in the 1976-77 status report.
The ranking system classifies the
professional staff into five levels,
according to power. Within each
level are ﬁve staff salary quintiles,
which classify the membels of
each power level according to
salary rank.

LEVEL 1, which consists of the

president and the vice-presidents,
and Level II, which consists of the
senior administrators, both con-
tain no women or minorities. Level
III, “managers of units or sub
units”, includes eight people, three
of who are women, and all receive
lower salaries than the five men at
this level.

Level IV, ”principal
professionals", is composed of 15
people including six women, one oi
whom is a minority; one woman is
in the top pay quintile, two are in
the second, one is in the third, and
two women and one minority are in
the fifth pay qui ile.

OF THE ll‘i people at Level V,
“administrative assistants, ads
missions oliicers, physical plant
managers", eight are women, one
of whom is a minority; one woman
is in tile top pay quintilc at this
level, two are in the third, two are
in the fourth. and three women,
including the minority memr
ber, are In the bottom quintile,

According to Eysenbach's
similar status report, 14 out of 44
(32 per centl Grinnell ad-
ministrators were women last
year, with the mayoriiy falling into
the lower salary quintilcs of their
rank§

ALTHOUGH THE Barrett and
Eysenhach reports both deal with
the status of women and minorities
in the professional administration,
Eysenbach also reported ex-
tensively on their status in the
faculty as well.

Last year,
Eysenbach’s

according to
report, women

comprised only 12 per cent of the
regular facility. This year, Barrett
noted, ”24 or 22.6 per cent of the 106
faculty who hold or share the 100
regular appointments” are
women. However, the number of
tenured women remains constant
at four (or seven per cent).

Flu bug threatens

by Marikay Kameczura

Grinnell schools are facing the
possibility oi a flu epidemic. but
college health officials are
reluctant to predict whether or not
the virus will cause a serious
health problem on campus.

Irma Hall, the administrative
supervisor at the Health Center,

.does not believe that the college is

about to feel the effects of an
epidemic and refuses to speculate
on the number of students likely to
contractthevirus.

A nurse at the Grinnell Come
munity Junior High School reports
that the level of absenteeism has
gradually risen since Christmas,

but she does not feel the level is
sufficiently high enough to be
considered an epidemic. Students
may be out of school for reasons
other than having the flu,
However, flu seems to be the best
explanation, since parents have
described symptoms of fever,
headache. dizziness, vomiting and
severe coughs, all of which are
common symptoms of the inn
fectious disease.

The superintendent of Grinnell‘s
public schools agrees that it has
not been substantiated that flu can
be blamed for the increase in
absenteeism.
