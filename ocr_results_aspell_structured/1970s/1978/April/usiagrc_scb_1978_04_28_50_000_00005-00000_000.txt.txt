Confronting the Real World

“But what
about"”

This question, from a ireshman
in my dorm, has been running
through my mind at odd in,
tervalsievery time i have to write
a column, as a matter of fact, I
suppose he wanted to know the
deep, cosmic significance of what I
Write. What does it all mean? Wllat
are the underlying themes? Before
I get carried away with English-
majortype verbiage, 1 will answer
simply. It‘s about things people
tincluding me. obviously) run up
against in their Grinnell careers.
This week I was going to write
about depression because it
seemed ubiquitous, but a friend of
mine vetoed that subject, He Said
we know all about it anyway. He
may be right, especially after last
week. Last week seemed like one
long rainy Monday, but now the
monsoons seem to be finished.
Things are looking better.

FOR ONE cheery tidbit, did you
know that Grinnell students can
function in the Real World? I had a
bout of dealing with the Real World
Just Saturday. Nothing serious, I
assure you, it was a brici attack,
but intense. I went with a friend to
Iowa City to look ior an apartment
for next year. We found quitea nice
place. after looking at some real
holes. First. there was the apartr
ment in the basement Not only did
it get no sunlight, the ceiling was
6'2" high. Those of us who are 5'11"
and like to wear shoes have
problems in apartments like that,
Then there was the apartment in

I got a real sense of ac-
complishment from finding an
apartment The only time either oi
us had ever looked for an apartr
ment was when we were on the
Grinnellrin-London program in
some ways, that was harder than
looking for an apartment in Iowa
City. We didn‘t know London, we
had jet-lag, and we were paying for
the nat in currency that was as
meaningful to us as Monopoly
money, '

0F coursc. the apartment we
found in London was only ior a
brief lime period. You can live in a
pretty crummy dump when it's
only ior three months, but you have
to bechoosier when you‘ll be there
longer. We did have a beautiful
apartment in London, though It
was green Green walls, green rug.
green couch. The hotrorange
Curtains provided tasteful contrast
to the monotonal color scheme.
The focal point oi the living rooni
was the lovely paintrbyrnumber
rendition of’ an Asian woman.
From unknown depths of a warped
imagination. one of my roommates
christened the woman Heidi
Colucci.

The apartment was for four
people, but the people upstairs said
that there had been six to eight
Arabs living there before us, They
must have been strange agents,
going by what they left behind. We
found an Arabic crossword puzzle,
a charming set oi chest X~rays,
and, in various odd places, hunks
of hair and used razor blades.

cl ean people either It was the first
time I Ve ever had to scrub a kit-
Chen window with steel wool In
order to have transparent glass.

TllE aiorcsaid kitchen was the
one in which the infamous “Mouse
Who Fell to Earth” episode took
place. (Fortunately. I was gone for
the Weekend.) As Leah was
washing the dishes, 3 mouse leapt
from the top oi the hotrwater
heater into the middle of the floor,
The mouse was wounded in its fall,
but not hurt enough to be caught
immediately. First, it had to be

chased around the kitchen (which ,

was the sile of a walk-in closet) by
three people They iinally trapped
it under a pot.

Now, what to do with the mouse?
Bludgeoning it would be messy,
flushing it down the toilet would be
risky. since we didn't know any
plumbers, and drowning it in the
sink would be distasteful in the
extreme. Finally, they slipped a
piece of paper under the pot. and
threw the mouse out the window.
Not nice. but effective, since It was
a Second-story window.

I looked ior mousetraps in the
apartments we vislted in Iowa
City because I don’t want to have

Arms protests constructive, not detrimental

To the editor: The frustration and
anger l lelt upon reading David
Blatt S column on ”Disarmament.
Another Look" was exceeded only
by my regret at his cynicism
about the feasibility of an imr
mediate halt to nuclear weapons
production. I find it completely
depressing that David believes
that the nonviolent protest this
weekend at the Rocky Flats
Nuclear Weapons Plant is “neither
wise or efficacious" and has a
“disastrous" goal. I could write
pages refuting his mistaken
assumptions and trying to con»
vince everyone oi the total ab»
surdity of increased proliferation,
but I will leave that to Beth Barr
net's Open Space article,

No letters?

To the editors: My curiosity was
certainly piqued by your editorial
of 14 April lamenting that you
never get letters any more, Send-

even have come to depend on this
source of supply, Surely a little
ingenuity could be brought to bear
on the problem. Or perhaps it's just
the time of year. Sincerely yours.

What concerns me here is the
implied apathy in David's words,
the wercan'traffect-therpowersr

theme in conversations I olten

“little guy” can't change things.

unrealistic to believe that the

Nuclear protest is
the rational solution

L“
, i
by both Bari-let

The threat of nuclear war is
increasing because of dangerous
technological developments such
as the cruise missile and other
more accurate missiles. Increased
proliferation of nuclear weapons
coupled with growing political
instability in many parts oi the
world heighten the chance that a
nuclear weapon might be used. and
suggests that limiting nuclear
conflict would be difficult. Possibly
most trightening oi all is the
growing feeling that detente has
failed and that an unending arms
race is inevitable

To accept such a view oi human
lolly seems to me to be the height
of irresponsibility. It seems
equally ioolish to acccpt the of
Iicial complacency that, despite
long. drawnout and largely unr
productive arms negotiations. all
ls well and that the arms race
presents no serious threat to our
security.

GOVERNMENT officials have
been blinded by a mentality that
makes detclltc and disarmament
impossible. This mentality IS
generated by the iundamental
assumption thatthc key to security
hes in the amassing of killing
power as a means of displaying the
force of our national will. The
vision oi diplomats. as they
bargain at the SALT tables for the
reduction of armaments, is
seriously distorted by this
irrational understanding of
security

Since the beginning at the SALT
negotiations. stockpiles on both
Sides have doubled, and newer.
more hideous and accurate nuclear
weapons have been introduced,
Thus, while arms controllers
advocate gradual disarmament
the actual 1number of arms has
spiraled upw.ards making the
environment much more
threatening to both Sides.

In his article ”Disarmament:
Another Look.” David Blalt argues
that a “public outcry” against
weapons prolileration is neither a
valid nor effective way of
pressuring the government in the
SALT negotiations. He states that
the issues are complex and implies

that rather than allow for potential
jingolsm on the public 5 part only
the “experts" Should deal with
such technical problems. This
notion ilatly contradicts
democratic theory which holds
that the testing of ideas in the
political community is the best
way to avoid the catastrophic
errors that can result from the
distorted vision of isolated leaders.

THE ONLY way to stop the
escalation of the arms race is [or
both sides to communicate to each
other their intention to stop. We
must realize that the true threat to
Our security rests exactly with the
myth that megatons of killing
power will insure our safety. In
realizing the insanity oi this myth
we must then accept that the
necessary first step is to make a
courageous initiative that conveys
our intention to stop the nuclear
arms race.

The World Peacemakers
Committee in Washington DC. has
outlined specific initiatives that the
President could make at the up»
coming U.N. Special Session on
disarmament, The pledges would
Include: to cease all nuclear
weapons tests everywhere, to
suspend for three years all plans
to develop and acquire new nuclear
weapons systems, to establish a
commission to convert the military
waste of our resources into
creating constructive job op-
portunities and meeting basic
human needs. and to work toward
outlawing nuclear weapons, just as
biological and chemical weapons
are now banned by international
agreement

NONE OI" these initiatives would
change present realities or, as
Blatt suggests, stimulate the
Soviets to “press their ad
vantage." As one World
Peacemakers member put it, “We
would still be as capable of
destroying the Sovuets under the
outlined conditions as ue are able
to destroy them now and the
Sovxets would be as capable of
destroying the United States than
as now, What these initiatives
would do Is reduce the tensions
between the two sides and indicate
a sincere intention of redefining
the meaning of global security.”

The madness of allowing our
securitytobedelinedbystructurcs
ior blowing up the globe is obvious.
Encourage everyone to par
ticipate in the efforts to arouse
people to the dangers oi nuclear
war which threaten to bring
unimaginable horrors to millions
and to threaten the very founr
datinns of civilization

We’re ready
for skip day,
