Applicantquality improves

by Debbie Weiner

The number oi applicants for
next year’s freshman class has
gone up, and their qualifications,
as measured in terms of class rank
and SAT scores, have improved,
according to Director of Ad-
missions John Hopkins.

So far. the number of ar»
plications received is running 10
per cent over last year. Seven per
cent of the applicants come irom
the upper fifth oi their high school
classes. 5 per cent more than last
year. according to Hopkins,

As or April 4. 1,054 students
have applied to Grinnell Last
year, 975 had applied by that date.
Hopkins predicts that, by the end of
the year, applications will have
increased 10 per cent over last
year. One hundred students have
been admitted under Early

hundred and thirty new students
are expected to arrive on campus
next fall, three more than last
year. This includes approximately
70 transfer students

The increase of applicants has
not been concentrated in particular
geographic areas, but has been
nationwide, according to Hopkins.
“The geographical distribution is
holding,” he stated. Forty-two
states are represented so far in the
applicant group, and 28 foreign
students have applied. Policies
regarding geographical
distribution “remain pretty much
the same." Hopkins says. The

AA progress Viewed

by DanFlynn

Grinnell does not, as one student
sardonically notes, have more
affirmative action (AA) com-
mittees per white AnglorSaxon
Protestant male than any outer
school in the country, but ai-
firmative action clearly is a
popular concern at Grinnell.

Furthermore, there are not, as
campus myth has it, five AA
committees, but the school does
have an active AA committee, and
there are several other
organizations that are keeping an
eye an affirmative action.

YET even with this much con-
cern, many studenm do not really
undetsmnd what AA is and how it
works. Roberta Atwell, chair»
person of the Affirmative Action
Advisory Committee, the college’s
official AA committee made up of
faculty and students, defines AA

simply as “positive action for past

inadequacies.” William Deminoff,
acting college AA officer, adds that
the college is under both “moral
and legal sanctions” to achieve
and main in a balanced faculty
and administration.

A balanced faculty: this is Where
problems arise. In attempting to
balance the faculty. the college
tries to maintain a percentage of
minorities and women that roughly
matches the percentage of women
and minorites among all degree
earners. Butthat's not as easy as it
sounds: statistics in these areas
are, according to former Vice-
Provost William Barrett’s
December 1977 AA report, at best
fragmented.

THE DATA currently used for
hiring comes from an earlier
report compiled by former Dean of
Curriculum Mary Eysenbach. The
report shows that the percenmge of

same as last year, while the math
score average has increased 20
points to 590. The average SAT
scores for admitted students are
580 verbal. 610 math.

Hopkins attributes this increase
to “ a few more applicants with
better scores.” Just a few scores in
the 700’s can greatly aiiect the
average, he states. He stresses
that the ”increase in quality in
terms of grade point average" is
more important, as “it is a better
predicter of ability to graduate
here at the college." He adds. “We
had to come of age with the SAT'S,
and discover that it wasn't cutvandr
dried, , .those tests do not measure
motivation and attitude, the most
important factors." He also
believes that “lhc hoard scores are
deiinitely culturally biased"
Grinnell takes this into account
when considering minority up
plicanls. he states

And they were reminders, We. too,

How did we get here"

John Hopkins. director of Ad-
missions. puts it succinctly:
“students choose a college [or
fickle reasons.”

But there is a more coherent
process behind getting people
interested in Grinnell. There are
many roads that lead to Grinnell,
and all are paved with the hard

made to attract people to the
college. Where do people hear
about Grinnell?

“A good school,” Hopkins said,
“should have no diiiiculty in going
out asking ior applicants "

Italso helps to have their names.
The Admissions Office purchases
names from the Educational
Testing Service's (ETSl
Student Search bureau. For a fee
l25 cents per name), the ETS sends
colleges such as Grinnell a list of
high school students, usually
Juniors. who both score well on the
PSAT and who rank in the upper
portion of their class.

THIS year Grinnell purchased
some 67,000 of these names from
ETS. Students whose names
Grinnell purchased live in one of
the school's top 18 states or

What does the Admissions oiiice
do with all those Wafﬂes" Direct
mail is the answer The 57,000
students are sent a letter. a glossy
30 page booklet entitled ours-lions,
which gives it briei overview oi the
college. and an application for
admissions. This year. the Ad

publication to the direct mail
packet. the first issue of Questions

HOPKINS believes the

admissions material. He says the
other admissions publications are
adequate in general terms, but do
not tell the students anything
”about the flavor of the school. . "
