FUNDS FOR purchase of ad,
ditional pieces and maintenance of
the eXisting 750 works come from
the Rosenlhal Fund and En-
dowment, and amount to about
$5,500 per academic year. Because
the collection depends on a private
gilt instead oi the college’s
operations budget, the committee
is allowed a great deal of
ﬂexibility It can accumulate its
money rather than having to spend
or forfeit allotted College funds.

THE PLANS FOR THE Darby
supplement were still on the
drawmg board when Glenn Leggctt
took over the presidency oi the
college. President Leggett's
director of development conferred
with the athletic coaches on
campus. who deliberated over the
building‘s design.

The director of development sent
Coach John Pfitsch to Washington.

Now that you’re back on campus, you’ll be seeing a lot of a young blond fellow.
That will be Congressman Leach, who wants your vote it) send him back to
Washington. If past campaigns are any indication, he'll probably wantvlo talk
about how tough your schedule looks this semester. . .Dr how you think the
Pioneers might do this fall. Instead of that kind of smalhtalk, we have a
suggestion. When you see Mr. Leach. ask him one of these questions:

l. Why did you vote against the Office of Consumer Representation that was
favored by Iowans twortorone?

. Congress considered a bill meant to provide loans to student coups and food
Coops that have trouble gelling bank financing because they’re ”nonprofit.”
Why did you oppose it?

.Why did you go along with the auto companies and vote against strict cleanrair

standards?

, The $2.3 billion allocation for the Nimitz nuclear aircraft carrier has been
called ”the most wasteful defense appropriation in a decade.” Why did you

vote to build it?

. Isn’t the so-called Kemp-Roth tax cut plan really iust Republican campaign
talk, and not a serious tax reform proposal at all?

IF YOU'DON’T LIKE THE ANSWERS YOU
GET FROM MR. LEACH ON THESE QUESTIONS,
THEN GET TO KNOW dick myers, the

PEC politics: how to build a gymnasium

government grant for the PEG.
UPON IIIS ARRIVAL in
Washington. Piitsch was
astonishedto find the HEW official
extremely congenial and the two of
them conversed for most of the
afternoon During the course of the
meeting Coach Pfilsch was sure
prised to iinri that the oilicial was
cnthilsiastic about Grinnell's
project and knew a great deal
more about Grinnell than one
would expect iroin a Washington
bureaucrat.
It turned out that this
official Worked
directly under Harry Hopkins, a
native Grilinell resident who at-
tended the college and later
became one of President Franklin
Roosevelt's closest advisers.
UNDER THE .»\L'SPICES of a
Depression work program, Mr
Hopkins had previously directed
the official to do research on the
history of Iowa. Much of this
research was periormed at
Griiinell, which accounts for the
official's respect for the institution,

Coach Plitsch received a per-.

sonal guarantee that Grinnell
would receive the maximum grant
possible for the PEC The one
provision was that the drawings ior
the PEG had to be finished and
approved by January 1, 1968, as the
grant program for higher
education buildings was to be
phased out during the remainder of
that year.

AFTER COACH Plitsch's return

 

to Gl'innell a committee was
tormed to design an ideal complek

The architectural firm of
Skidmore, Uwings, and Merrill
designed a building with an
estimated cost of 3 5 million
dollars. The board of trustees
would not approve this plan
because loo much ol the cost would
not be covered by the grant. The
firm revised their plans. with this
cost estimate cut to uppioxiiiiateiy

and was submitted to HEW before
the January first deadline. On
March i, 1968, a lederal grant oi,
$500,000 was approved. in addition
Grinnell received a three per cent
loan for an additional $500,000,

With the government grant and

influence was indirect, Hopkins
played a large part in the creation
oi today‘s PEC.
