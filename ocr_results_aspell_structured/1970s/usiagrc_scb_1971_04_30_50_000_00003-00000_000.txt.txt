Grinnelliuns Form Baha’i Cluli

by Jeff Dick

Many Grinnell students and
members of the Grinnell come
munity are presently investi-
gating the Baha'i World Faith
and there are now severalop'
portunities for further an’
estigation.

The Baha'i Faith is consid*
ered a World Faith fora num-
ber or reasons. Baha'is, mew
mbers of the Baha'i Faith,
live in more than three hunr
dred countries of the world.
They are people whoformerly
had differnet and conflicting
religious backgrounds. Some
were Buddhists, Jews, Musr
lims, Hindus, Catholics, Pro—
testants, or had no religion at
all. But in the Baha’i Faith,
they have found a sense of
unity that makes the competir
tion of sects and denominati-
ons seem unimportant to them.
Baha'is are people of differ-
ent national and racial backs
grounds, but the Baha's te-
achings have given them a jir
achings have given them a hi-
gher loyalty , the loyalty to
humanity. it develops worlds
mindedness. Also, the Baha’i
Faith does not have any pr-
iesthood or professional clerr
gy, and an everrincreasing
number of people throughout
die world have found it to be
a practical, spirital religion
with the mission of uniting
the world in one common faith
and one order.

Basically, Baha’is believe in:
One God, the oneness of man-
kind, independent ’ vestigar

tion of truth, equality of men
and women, elimination ofpr-
ejudice of all kinds, and un-
iversal peace upheld by ,a
world government.

These are just a few of the
beliefs that make up the for
undation of the Baha’s World
Faith. Baha'is know from in-
creasing experience that this
Faith can save menand women
from the hatreds, thepessism,
the corruption, and the mate
erialism of an age. They know
because they have seen it and
experienced it. They invite you
to investigate this Faith and
share in this spirital adven-
ture.

A Grinnell Eiha’i Club has
recently been formed for this
purpOSe. The members of the
club meet every Tuesday for

a PDR dinner and also for ,
study classes that have been ,

arranged during the week.
Also, every Thursdaynightat
9 p.m. in Younker Lounge,
some of the Grinnell Baha’is
are present to talk about the

'Faith as well as many other

things of interest to the in-
dividuals attending. On Sut‘r
day, May 9, at 4 p.m., there
will bea Baha'iprogram which
all members of the Grinnell
community will be invited to
attend. There will probably
be Baha‘is from other parts
of the state present as well.

Rock Creek Summer ProjectL

A group of fiteen students,
headed by Tony Wheeler, will
study the environment of the
Rock Creek lake watershed
this summer under an$18,000
grant from the National Sci-
ence Foundation (SNF).

Students in anthropology,
economics, biology, and oh-
emistry will study and try to
correlate biological and oh
emical levels of pollution with
the economic and social uti-
lity of the lake area to its
users.

The project is one of apr
proximately 125 interdiscipr
linary studies in the area of
the environment by five to
fifteen undergraduates studs
ents, which are funded by the
NSF this year under a new
program.

The five students who or-
ganized theproposal to NSF
and who have been doing itr
dependents this semester in
preparation for the summer's
work -- Wheeler, Anne Wal-

.ter, Peter Doering, jim Far

ulwell, and Mike O'Connor--
will work on the project for
twelve weeks this summer.
Ten other students will work
for ten weeks.

Wheeler told the 58:13 that
believes the project has very
“ambitious" and "tar reach-
ing" goals. If the group can
achieve their aim of develop

perspective on media in ‘a

talked about the problems of
getting the ”bias of truth"
into news. The other radio
people at the conference, from
KDNA in St. Louis, hada lot:
of things to say about the trials
of none commercial radio. r

Jenny Stone of Solidarity
Films and the crowd from
Cold Shot in Minneapolis eX’
hibited very different attitu-
des toward their work. Jenny
constantly emphasized the po-
litical effects of her collec-
tive's work, while the Cold
Shot folks injected some polir
tical satire more seconarily
into their works, which were
more culturally oriented. Both
groups' films were vastly
different from Hollywood's
products. Leonard Henny from
Films For Social Change made
a powerful statement for sin-
cerity and radicalism. Anam-
biguous figure among the cone
ferees was Dan Rottenberg.
Managing editor of the Chi-
cago Journalism Review and
a “straight" journalist, his
criticism of the established
press showed that much ofthe
dissatisfaction with our media
is rooted in very American
traditions.

The symposium participants
made a good, blabby team. The
students who got in contact
with them, one way oranother,
learned a lot.

ing a‘ complete environmental
study of Rock Creek Lake,th-
eir methodology, results, and
recommendations will have
immediate implications for
the many lake environments
throughout the country simir
lar to Rock Creek.

The Rock Creek Lake and
Environment Studies team
(”Reckless") will investigate
the "biolog'cal and chemical
levels of pollution by taking
"chemical analyses of water,
sentiment, and soil samples
in the watershed and correl~
ating these to levels of pi-
ancton, bacterium, and bot—
tom fauna," Wheeler said.
Those basically scientific pa-
rameters will be related to
economic and social parame-
ters which govern the use
of the lake. These economic
and social parameters--me-
asures of the use and need
of the lake by farmers,homer
owners, and recreational use
ers V will be determined by
questionaires and by eco-
nomic cost analysis methods.

The techniques of biological
and chemical sampling and
analysis that will be used
during the summer are being
worked out this semester by
Wheeler, Anne Walter and
Peter Doering, who are doing
Independents related to the
project.

Mike O'Connor, of the eco-
nomics team, is dfveloping an
nomics team is developing
extensive computer program
to be used to compileandana»
lyze the questionairre data,
Jim Faulwell is developing
the questionairre. In the soc-
ial studies area, the team is
finding that it must develop
most' of the theoritical aspe»
cts of the preliminary work;
there is no previous work to
draw on.

The project’s immediate goal
is to determine if the levels
of pollution fit the needs and
wants of the community, or if
there is some practical sole
ution to the eutrophication the
lake is undergoing. The pre
sent life expectancy of the
lakE, Wheeler said, is ten
to twelve years.

Wheeler hopes that the gr-
oup will come up with a set
of solutions to correct the
rate of eutrophication, which
will be feasible from both a
scientific and the community's
standpoint. In this area, the
interdisciplinary nature ofthe
group is especiall valuable -
group is especially valuable -
it will orient them toward ﬁ-
nding solutions which are
within the economic capable
lities of the community.

Already, the project meme
bars have contactedmany loc-
al and state organizations wh-
ich have offered to help them
or work with them. For eX*
ample, the 19a soilandwater
conservation commissions
have provided maps and stat-
istics, the Iowa State Univer-
sity hygenic labs have aided
them in settingupanalysis sy-
stems, and the Farm Bureau
and State Park Commission
have offered assistance.

The group asked the lowa
State School of Agriculture
Engineering for help in under-
standing farming practices,
and the school responded by
offering them theassistance of
two graduate students, aswell
as giving them material to
read concerning agricultural
procedures and techniques.
The grad students assist and
work with them without any pay
other than travel costs.

Wheeler hopes that the solu-
tions proposed by the team
in their report, to be sub
mitted to a national conven-
tion of the JSF early next ye-
ar, will be significant enough
that they can be published
in a scientific journal. The
total report, however, is ex-
pected to run aroun 500 or
600 pages, and it will be a
big problem just to condense
it.

The ten students other than
mose already mentioned are
Deborah Allan, Earl Crecel‘
ius, Judith Galeota, Susan
Barisas, Carol Patterson,
Mary Stuart, Bruce Meisenh-
eimer, Clark Reinders, Donna
Robinson, and Rick Eisenman
(a Knox College junior who
lives in Grinnell).
