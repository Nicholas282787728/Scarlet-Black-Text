“Honors”
Program

reviewed

The curriculum committee in
meeting Thursday' tabled con-
sideration of a proposal for a new
“honors” program authored by
Dean oi Curriculum, Mary
Eysenbach,

Graduation with honors is given
to senior members who are
recommended by their department
and approved by the Dean oi the
College. According to the college
catalog in order to qualify “a
student must on the basis of seven
semesters oi college work have

. achieved at least a 3. 4 grade- point
average in the major iield and a
cumulative average oi 3. 2. ”

The proposal for a new “honors
program” would take emphasis
away on “achievement' ln terms of
credits accumulated and grades
obtained" in favor of a program
which would “measure the quality
ofa student's education in terms of
structure. discipline and coherence
rather than quantity of work or
GPA’S.”

Under Eysenbach’s proposal the
new program would require that
admission in to honors would have
to be obtained prior to the start of
the student’s senior year. Ade
mission would be gained through
“closed book, in-Class" com-
prehensive examinations which
would be based on preparatory
work in the student’s major and the
ability to relate material from
secondary iields.

Following admission to the
“honors program” the student
would be expected to write a B.A.
thesis which would require two
consecutive semesters of work.
The thesis would be presented to a
three-person committee ior ap-
proval.

Under the proposal, departments
would not be required to oiier an
“honors program.”

The vote to table passed 773 but
not before the committee had
sufficiently aired many of their
concerns.

g The proponents oi the proposal
saw it as giving coherency to a
student’s education at Grinnell by
requiring honors candidates to
demonstrate competance in
disciplines other than their major
field resulting in a more integrated
liberal arts education. The honors
program would provide the “inc
Centive of recognition” for
students to pursue such a course.

Dean Eysenbach commented

-’ that ”the faculty has been remiss
in not offering such a program.”
An existing “faculty advising
system unbacked by an incentive is
not going to change the pattern" oi
course distribution by students.

Betsy Scheuerman, student
member of the committee, was
concerned that such an honors
program would cause departments
to put pressure on what they
considered to be their outstanding

6 students to participate.

There was wide concern ex
pressed that other routes be

available to students to. achieve,

, ,“honors”. Dean cysenbachstated_

“I don’t like the existing honors
program, but I don’t know whether
this should be the sole one.”

in tabling the motion, sentiment
was expressed that the committee
would be receptive to other
proposals for honors program
based on other than grade point.

In other action, an attempt was
made to reconsider the Curriculum
Committee’s approval of a
proposed inter—disciplinary course
on Medieval Culture,

The proposed course, intended to
be altered next spring, would be
taught by two professors drawn
from the iollowing departmentsi
history, political science, art, and
English. The course would be a
“depth study of three or four
selected areas” of development in
Europe between 800-1650 A.D. and
be offered for four credits.

There would be three sections of
the course offered and they replace
three sections oi History 101A
European History 1759 to Present.
Credit granted would be either in
th Humanities or Social Sciences
D sions.

The course was an object of an
SGA resolution passed Wednesday.
Student sentiments expressed in
the resolution and concerns on the
part of the Humanities Division
resulted in an attempt to reconr
sider the committee's_ previous
approval. Reconsideration was
moved by Randy Magee oi the
Russian Department.

The resolution stated: “The
current procedure tor approving
new curriculum assures extensive
discussion of the nature and
consequences of courses by all
members of the academic com-
munity. However. we feel that the
uniqueness and magnitude of this
course, as one originating from
several departments and divisions
has hampered such discussions."

The objections of the Humanities
Division were related to their
expected current approval of a
Course for which there was a lack
oi a syllabus to consider. The
division withdrew their support oi
the course earlier this week in
favor of further consideration.

The course, because it is inter-
disciplinary, requires the approval
of both the Humanities and Social
Science Divisions. However,
departmental educational policy
committees on which students are
involved do not have to approve the
course even though iaculty
members of the department will be
involved in teaching the course.
Educational policy committees
that would be affected are English,
art, history, and political science.

The consequences oi the
Humanities Division Withdrawing
support of the course are un-
certain. The approval of the
Curriculum committee still stands
as the motion to reconsider failed
64.

Final authority in all curriculum
decisions lies with the College
President

The Saga fast, media iinances

the attention of the SGA meeting
Wednesday night under the
leadership of the 1975-76 SGA
cabinet.

The Living Hope Community

Nigeria, has been chosen by a
unanimous vote oi the Joint Boards
as the beneticiary oi this
semester’s SAGA last.

The organizer and principal in»

The campus~wide last, scheduled
for Friday, April 25, will give each
board student the opportunity to
make a contribution to the war-

Nigeria by skipping dinner.
Although the exact amount of the
contribution has not yet been
determined, it should be in the
neighborhood oi 72 cents per
participating student. Sign up
sheets will be available at all
dinner lines next week.

Dave Calvert, Clark Hall

that the money would be used to

Nta would assure that the money
be used ior hungry people and not
ior large organizations or
bureaucracies.

Campus media organizations
gained financial independence
from the Student Auditor. The
business manager will now be able
to draw funds directly from the
Treasurer’s otiice, creating
greater ireedom in purchasing
since the Student Auditor is often
not available for necessary and
immediate transactions,

The power of the Business
Manager who will handle funds for
the Grinnell Book, KDIC, and the
Scarlet and Black was questioned
by some Joint Boards members
fearing excessive control over
funds. The Student Publications
and Radio Committee, who
presented the motion, allayed this
worry by replying that the SGA
treasurer would always have
access to the books and any illicit
handlings would allow the Joint
Boards or the committee to fire the
business manager.

The Grinnell Relays obtained $55
from SGA. Joint Boards members
expressed dismay that the amount
requested was so small, but the
relay committee assured SGA that
unless unforeseen circumstances
developed the funds were sut-

'Turner
looks
ahead

“In This Place, In This Hour"
was Herrick Chapel Saturday
morning. shortly after the
President’s Medallion was placed
upon the shoulders of A. Richard
Turner as ninth president of
Grinnel College. Turner delivered
the Inaugural Address. centering
on the students at today whom he
calls the “dreamers, planners. and
builders" with vision and action for
“enormous problems (that) will
render our lives less than human,"

Turner called Grinnell 3 training
ground for the ”master builder"
who will juggle the contradictions
generated by change. The college
stimulates change, taking students
in a “new direction as they
discover Worlds here that make it
hard to go home again.” As a place
oi tensions which any college
should be, the tensions of the larger
college iamily are “preferable to
the hell oi general content and
paciiic agreement.”

The future of the “citizen
builder,” who by age and
education is an individualist, will
depend upon “subordination oi
individual prerogatives to an
unprecedented imperative of
political cooperation, a
cooperation realizable only by
those whose sense oi seli truly has
given them a sense of others.”

With the changing world, Turner
remarked that with “shifting
truths it is hard to embrace
values.” The only morality widely
acceptable is an informed choice
based upon commitment born
from a Continuing examination of
the nature of truth.

The education of the citizen,
according to Turner, lies in the
attitudes oi teaching and learning
underlying the curriculum.

The president was concerned
that iaculty and teachers labor at
forming habits of mind rather than
building particular com,
petencies. “I believe that
students and faculty alike should
explore the poles ot thinking,
trying on one hand those
disciplines with particular respect
ior precision and tact . . . on the
other hand, all should experience
the arts and letters with meir
reliance upon intuition . . . ” Ad-
ditionally, every student should be
fluent in a second
Whether it is verbal,
mathematical, visual, or auditory,
Turner claimed, because any
presents a new experience at the

Trustees
drop
program

in a unanimous decision, the
Board of Trustees last Saturday
voted to terminate the program in
communications studies at the end
of the semester.

President Turner explained the
Trustees’ action, noting that to
stall a department would require
one to two iaculty positions. One
tenured member of the com—
munications department is
currently on leave, but Turner
emphasized that no come
munications courses would be
altered even it the person were to
return to Grinnell.

The trustees, Turner elaborated,
were not “philosophically” op-
posed to a communications
program, maintaining in the
motion that a good strong liberal
arts education was an appropriate
base for a communications career.

Concern was expressed by some
students that existing internships
with local media would be
discontinued, lacking an advisor of
academic rank to evaluate the
work and grant credit. Turner
stated that possible arrangements
might be made so that the ins
ternshlps could continue.

The discontinuation of the
communications program all but
spells the end for the Grinnell ch»
apter ot Women in Com-
munications founded here in 1923.
The organization requires that
members must have taken at least
one communications course in
college in order to quality tor
membership, a requirement that
future students will be unable to
meet.

William Deminoff has taught the
two communications courses at
iered this year. but resigned trom
his iaculty position in order to
devote his time to his duties as
director oi college relations and
special assistant to the President
Responding to the termination oi
the department, Deminoff Come
mented, “Given the current
economic constraints, I un-
derstand the Board’s decision and
accept it."

Natural resources and lonliness v

suriaced in the address as Turner’s
worries for the student. “Can we
continue to allow students to leave
this place without a thorough
understanding of the issues in-
volved in the proper stewardship or
earth and her creatures?" “For
too many the campus is a lonely
place. yet we must ask it in a
world of lonely. people, it makes
sense to be lonely alone.“ . .
