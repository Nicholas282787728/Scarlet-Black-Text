All Housing Here' Is Tight

More so than in the past,
Grinnell is now facing an ex-
tremely tight housing situa*
tion. The problem is due to a
number of various reasons in-
cluding an increased enrolk
ment, some late enrollments,
and some situations where off
campus housing deals fell thrr
ough.

According to figures from
housing director Jim "l ieder-
man, there are onlysix spaces
for men on campus, three of
which will go tofreshmenpree
sently living with the RA in
Main. The situation with w0e
men's housing is not too much
better, with only nine openings
available.

Tiederman said that the cole
lege likes to keep its dormir
tories full but he expects

things to ease considerablv
second semester, when Grin-

nell will lose students thru
graduation, leaves ofabsence,
dropouts, and cancelations.

Aslronomy,Anyone?

In response to Mr. Clotfel'
ter's star~gazing invitation to
students a couple ofweeks ago,
several students have recently
banded together to form a
Grinnell stargzing society.
The group, which presently
consists of aboutlSmembers,
gathers near the 50-yard line
of Ward Field at 10 o'clockon
Monday and Wednesday evens
ingseeproviding, of course,
that the sky is clear.

Bob Sparks, unofficial group
leader, reports that within a
week or so the group willprOe
bably have access to the var
ious college telescopes, and
will begin star-gazingin earne
est.

Students interested in partie
cipating in the group are welr
cortte to contact .Bob Sparks
atie’xt. 213.

Figures from last year show
that there were 1218 students
first semester and there were
only 1132 second semester- .
an 86 student loss. There are
presently 1249 students.

There are presently eight
college owned and operatedoff
campus houses. Also, more
than 100 students live in none
college off campus housing.

Another problem constantly
confronting Mr. Tiederman
and office is the ever ensuing
complaint of thenon‘compati‘
bility between roommates.
Mr. Tiederman emphasized
"it is very difficult to obtain
room changes so everyone
should try to make things as
livable as possible in existing
housing."

Should one desire a room
change for next semester the
Office should receive a writ-
ten request stating the reason
for the change.

a number of students still
have not found satisfactory
housing, due to the tight hous-
ing situation and late regis-
tration.

with Friends

One student who was inter
viewed by the 5&8 did not ar-
rive on campus until several
days after registration; he had
drawn a single in Cowles last
year, but thought he would
transfer this summer. He was
assigned to a double this year
by the deans of StudentshOW’
ever, he wants a single, and
is currently staying with fri-
ends in various halls.

Another student, who had not
preregistered or drawn a
room last year, arrived a
week after registration. He
stayed with friends for a few
days, then was placed in Clark
Hall, and was later resettled
in Read Hall. ‘

New Frat Not To Discriminate

Wednesday, September 22,
will go down in Grinnell 50cc
ial history asa red- letter day,
for it marked the birth of
Alpha Sigma Sigma, Grinnell's
first social fraternity. Fife
teen men and one woman joined
to form the first chapter; at
last report membership has
more than doubled.

The founders state that the
purpose of Alpha Sigma Sigma
is "fun," whichwas described
as “having more good
keggers." The group plans
to organize a large kegger at
the earliest possible date,

in keeping with the doctrine
of equality for all, Alpha Sigc
ma Sigma membershipis open
to any interested party; all
one needs do to become a
member is tosign the charter.
Accordingly, women have been
joining the group and now come
prise about one-third of the
membership. The founders
reportedly expect the meme

bership to rise.

' ’ library Researches Book Disoppearonces

by David Nicolai

Thefts of librarybooksareat
a level serious enough to war-
rant a fiveeyear study of the
problem, but not so seriousas
to cause the library staff to
consider any security mea
sures in the near future, ac
cording to Mrs. Mary Wyly,
Reference Librarian in Che
arge of Circulation.

The library staff is now in
the second year of its five
year study, in which they are
taking complete inventory of
the most frequently used col-
lections in the library. By
noting all missing books, they
hope to be able to estimate
the actual numbers and per
centages of missing books.
Although the staff has yet to
compile and study manyactual

figures, Mrs. Wyly said that
approximately 3%of the books
on which inventory was taken
during the 1969- 70 school year
were missing, and that this
percentage increased slightly
last school year.

Mrs. Wyly, removing the
possibility of future security
measures because of their
high costs, thinks the onlyway
to combat this problem is to
change student attitudes to-
ward the problem. She feels
that students’ attitudes have
improved in at least one res‘
pect during the last two years;
whereas formerly blame fora
missing book was usually
placed on the library staff,
students now seem to realize
that their peers are usually

responsible for the loss ofthe
book.

However, she also thinks that
many students are unaware of
the importance ofcheckingout
all books they take out of the
library. For instance, during
a two—month period last year,
660 books which had not been
checked out were returned to
the library.

Mrs. Wyly emphasizes that
the librariansarenotattempt-
ing to keep track of students
by asking them to check out
all books they use, butmerely
to maintain a record ofthe loa
cation of all library books.

founders claim, to “avoid all
the power struggles and cgo~
tripping” that are character
istic of many suchorganir

costs involved are voluntary

A statewide studentemsed
consumer advocate organizae
tion is in the process of being
established. Joe Hyland, who
is a member of Ralph Nader's
organization, briefly visitetl
Grinnell on Friday inanefforl
to create some enthusiasm for
this project. Unfortunately,
only three students turned out
to speak with him.

The proposed organization
would be fundedbyan increase
of three dollars per school
year in the tuition of those
students who would desire to
contribute. EXtensiveorgani-
zations based on campus sup*
port have already been set up
in Oregon, Minnesota, Ohio,
and Connecticut. Funds raised
from the students would be
used to hire a full time pro'
fessional staff of consumer
advomies. Hopefully, college
and graduate students would
supply the necessary inali-
power to research topics of
interest, The results would
then not only be publicized
but also placed before the
appropriate legislative body.

It is important to note that
elective represetntetivos fr-
om participating institutions
would fully control the pron
fessional staff and the areas
of research. Thus, there isan
intriging possibility for creat-
ing an on going and viable SIU’
dent coalition.

The important queStionwhich
must necessarily be faced by
Grinnellians is whether such
activity is worthy of the ex
penditure of time and money.
in my own mind, there is
little choice as the only plau-
sible manner for one to afr
feet the inertia of our societal
institutions ls‘b'y bringl gor-
ganized pressure and incrimi-
nating publicity on thoseareas
in which change is desired.

If anyone is interested inas-
sisting in the organization;
contact Phil Sasich, Shelley
Floyd, or Mike Siegel.
