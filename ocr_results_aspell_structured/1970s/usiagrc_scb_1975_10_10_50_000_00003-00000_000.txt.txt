Sunny surprises

Although some rumors had been ﬂoating
around for several days the dismissal of classes
on Tuesday was, on the whole, a well kept secret
The decision was not made public until Monday
night, Many closed their books and hit the Pub or
the bakery.

Various events were planned for Tuesday with
most of them taking place in front of the Forum,
Students turned out for the activities and others
relaxed on their own. But, getting people out of
their books and into the healthy sunshine is never
an easy task at Grinnell. For a stubborn law not
even the sight at Turner tooling around in a golf
cart or a Virgin sacriﬁce at the central campus
sculpture could pry them away from the glories
of Hegel, calculus or constitutional law. Not
many students were aware theta few members of
the “power elite" actually took over the
President’s Office in Nollen House, even though
the only resistance met was in the person of the
president’s secretary.

It was a relaxing, refreshing break [or some, a
day to catch up for others. Though it is too bad

that there were those who felt forced to Studv.
the day, on the whole, was aVJob well done.
