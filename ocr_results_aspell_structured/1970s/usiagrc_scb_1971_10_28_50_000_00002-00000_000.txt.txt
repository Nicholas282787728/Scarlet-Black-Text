The Great Schism

By September, 1972 the administration will have moved its offices from
Burling basement totheWhiteHouseThis move will open Hurling basement
to be used as originally intended, for the storage of books We would like
to propose that at least one other space on campus he put to the use for
which it was originally intended.

We refer, of course, to the Forum Basement. The pinball machines now
occupy spaceoriginallydesignedasaworksliopareai‘or student publications
and organizations adjacent to the $515 and Cyclone offices We have lived
in uneasy tension with the pinball machines all year, though it was largely
the journalistic efforts of J.C. Labowitz iniast year’s 5&5 that brought the
machines to the college {or the lirst time. The coming of a yearbook stall
headed by four coreditdrs and a business manager will evict the 5&8
editorial staff from one of the two offices where some quiet can still be
found. Unless the Pinball Noise Crisis is corrected, the yearbook Staff
will share nightly headaches with the newspaper staff. The combined
staffs of the two publications will need more room than is now available,
since the 5&5 now utilizes the entire copy room for three days of Ihe
week

The machines sometimes provide unfair competition to the wise counsel
and leadership of the editorial staff. Editorial judgements should not be
punctuated by the dinging of bells. At least one 5&8 photographer has been
known to indulge in pinball when he should be in the darkroom, Editors
and business managers who occasionally indulge in pinball should be
doing it on their own time anyway, so they would not be unfairly incone
venienced by the removal of the machines from the forum basement.

There is, happily, an easy and obvious solution to our woes. According
to a recent article on our sports page (the authority on matters athletic)
pinball has become an intramural sport. What could bea more fitting
location for these blinking pieces of athletic equipment than the new
sports palace on north campus?

{This Solution to the problem should not be Iakendsdefinitive (unlike the
solutions we normally propose in our editorials), and there may be better
locations for the pinball gallery. it has been suggested that the basement
of the downtown office building would be an ideal location, because the
ﬂashing lights and dinging bells would add authentic atmosphere to the
operations of the computer center. One of the proposals is to move the
pinball machines to one of the corner lecture rooms in the Poli Sci Der
partment, tor the convenience of Mr. Magee. other possibilities nearer
to the heart of campus are the electronic music studio, the physics laborae
tories, and the SGA office (if, as it is rumored, SGA bureaucrats would
like to move to a larger office).

As Abraham Lincoln might have said if he had had pinballs next to the
oval office in the White House, "A house divided against itself cannot
stand. The Forum Basement Cannot exist half free press and half enslaved

Well, it's med-sem again, atime
for running away from the Grinnell
experience and writing short
columns. Since the space ailotcd
tor my column is too short to review
a record, it gives me an excuse to
give the second bi-annual KDIC a-
wards. Winners are chosen on their
format, particular DJ traits, and
how much they pay inc.

1. The Best Show , This pres-
tigeous award is given tothemaster
of the “Tripple Ripple”, R. Marshall
Barber, it is a heartwarming sight
indeed to watch nostalgic tears of
happiness flow as Marshall spins
those memorable discs.

2. Best DJ Voice: Marshall comes
to mind again but honorable mention
goes to John Seely. His touches of
true proiessionalism make his show
great (Also he's on the board and
it never hurts to praise the staff.)

3. Best Non-Show r The Gaines
Boys have done it again; actually
they haven’t done it again. Since
they’ve been stiﬂed at KDIC they’ve
taken up pantomime. Better to be
seen and not heard?

4. Best Soul Show - No doubt about
this one. The Bold Soul Sisters have

Morning 7»lO slot. Three cheers to
OHS. Principal who refuses these
hard-working kids to put up signs
advertising their OWN show. It’s
minds like these who wind up being
elected Iowa’s Attorney General.

Well, that’s it for awhile. To move
onto a more serious vein, KDIC is
worth listening to, this year more
than ever. in general programming
has improved 100% from previous
years. Tile station is more organized
than ever before as the boardmem-
bers really care. The special pro-
gramming has been truly excellent.
The station’s even getting decent
records ilito the library, thanks to
more hard work by the board. And,
believe it or not, not as many
records are getting ripped off by
cheap DJ’s.

So, it your Mom asks you what you
want ior Christmas/Chanukah/or
Rudy LaRusso’s Birthday, tell her
you want an FM RADIO! How else can
you hear good music etc. without
hearing ads about toothpaste and
cross~y0ur-lleart bras? (Finally
to please Mark Sableman, lwill re
view a record he has asked about;
Red Stewart’s new one. It’s great.)

Urge Equality
For Pengums

To the Editors:

We are writing in the interest of
all fair-minded students of Grin-
nell. pertaining to the EPC issue.
We are of course referring to the
deplorable lack of representation
of campus minorities on the EPC,
and possible solutions to it. Our
specific concern is the inhuman
plight of the Antarctic Penguins of
the college community, victims of
at least 400 years of oppression at
the hands of a prejudiced society.
Supporters of Antarctic Penguins
(SAP) is the group of students that
will rectify our guilt problem--
we mean, our Penguin problem.

The tirst step toward equality, of
course, is a seat on the EPC. Fore
tunately, the precedent set by The
Concerned Black Students makethis
a purely periunctory gesture hardly
worthy of discussion. If concerned
blacks should be given a separate
vote on educational policy, Antarc-
tic Penguins deserve equal treat-
ment.

We have also noticed the distinct
dearth of Antarctic-American fac-
ulty and staff, and we feel that
Antarctic penguins deserve just as
much token representation as anyone
else.

Lastly, it has come to our atten-
tion that the number of Antarctic
Penguins entering the college has
not varied in 125 years. This zero
enrollment figure smacks of quota
regulation, and we are considering
also demanding that the Admissions
Committee be composed of 51 per
cent persons of Antarctic descent,
to ensure a fair chance of ad
missions. However, lest the college
community take us for a hunch of
radicals or bigots, we will not start
agitating for this measure untilCBS
does, at which time we will decide
who is more oppressed and suf-
iering, and therefore moredeserv—
ing of the benefits of the Liberal-
Guilt Syndrome.

Just by the way, Antarctic Penguins
are sometimes pretty good students.

Outraged By
Shrew Tamers

To the Editors:

As a member of Thursday night’s
iirst-act audience of “The Taming
of the Shrew" l am inclined to say
that l was more than mildly outr
raged, I don’t know what one can
expect from Grinnell College thea-
tre, or with what criteria one even
begins to determine what is good
college theatre, and what reeks.
Maybe someone thinks that modern
theatre should produce ”gut" re-
actionvany gut reaction, And per-
haps in this way, theperformanceof
“The Taming of the Shrew" was
“valid”. But l doubt it. Shakes-
pears was a master of his art, his
capacity to touch people has “with
stood the test of time" — hedoesnot
need Grinnell student actors to in-
toxicate or otherwise pervert his
poetry.

It saddens me that Shakespeare is
no longer taken seriously, maturely
or sensitively by the Grinnell
Theatre Department, and I would
strongly recommend that student
actors take a good look at their fel-
low artists. the musicians, who at
least make an effort to contribute
serious performances —- before the
theatre department attempts aver-
sion of “To Stone a Mockingbird”.

Grading Article

To The Editors:

Last Thursdaybrought an unusually
busy and hectic night to the $513
office, It was probably very late in
the evening when John Wylie made
an addition to Patti Tompkins’ ari-
cle about the student meeting on
the grading issue last week. I sym-
pathize with the conditions which
probably caused him to erroneously
paraphrase my comments, But be-
cause his mistakes distort, if not
completely obscure, certain argu-
ments of Mr. Parslow, I feel I
should call attention to them. The
article states:

Mr. Morris Parslow, arging that

Grinnell was an elite school where-

in students competed to gain ade

mission and continue to compete
after their arrival, argued that the
school can not have a Situation
where some can and some want to
compete, that somewerejustgrade
grubbing to stay in the institution.

John took his information from the
minutes, written by myself and not
yet approved by the committee, of
the last All College EPC meeting.
Those minutes read:

Mr. Parslow spoke to the Value of

grades as a part of the educational

system at Grinnell, arguing that

Grinnell is an elite school, for

which students competed to gain

admission and in which students
compete after their arrival. He
does not believe that the school
can have a situation where some
can and some cannot compete. Mr.

Taylor thought that not all stu—

dents want to compete, that some

were (asihe secretary paraphrases
his argument) just grade-grubbing
to Stay in the institution.

Clearly, the SEE article puts words
into Mr. Parslow’s mouth, andsince
my name was given as the source of
information for the whole thing I
hasten to make the correction.

Porlrays Smoolh’ ‘Giumio

by Elliott Lewis

Shakespeare's ”The Taming of the
Shrew" opened last rursday to one
of the three capacity crowds that
appeared during the weekend per»
formances in Roberts Theater.

As are most opening nights, last
Tursday being no exception, the en-
tire cast and audience seemed to be
filled with a natural anxiety, which
was compounded in the audience
when a planted drunk and frantic
usher interrupted the opening mo-
ments or the play. (Sources say that
the male was effective because the
drunk was type cast)

Alterwards, the play continued with
the first scene provingtobeagesta-
tion period for the audience to be-
come accustomed to the somewhat
jumbled Shakespearian lingo.

Through the entire first act the
cast seemed to be nervous. However,
after the beginning Ofthe second act,
the lines were smootherandtheplay
in general moved along at a more
comfortable pace.

The character of Grumio, por—

trayed by Dennis Mackler, was one
of the smoothest of the acted parts.
The overall stage appearance of the
entire cast was colorful and pleas-
ant. Effective use of the stage and
its props were maintained through-
out the entirety oftheplay. The main
set was a large wooden platform with
a raised level to the right of the
stage. Well-coordinated lighting
made it possible for the viewer to
see what was happening both on the
platform and on the stage. This is
a good concept in stage production,
and was commendably done,

The lake drunk scene was effec-
tive, howeveraudienceplantsas well
as audience-participation gimmicks
are fast becomingaclicheintheatri»
cal productions. Discretion should
be exercised carefully when using
these devices. In "Shrew" it was
done tastefully and added a new
ﬂavor to the alreadyehumorous plot.
Opening nights are always bad
trips, especially for non—Shake-
spearian actors in Shakespearian
plays. in this production, almost the
best was made of a strange play.
