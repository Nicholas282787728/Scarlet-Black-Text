Cliitinns Presents Greek Music, New And Old

by Althea Kallas

Dr. Sotirios (Sam) Chianis, anethe
nomusicologist irom SUNY-Bingr
hamton, presented facts and impres-
sions about Greece and Greek folk

 

Cretan Lvra

music last Friday night in the South
Lounge.

Dr. chianis has been going back
to Greece every summer for the
past iiiteen years, taping tolk music
and collecting folk instruments,
transcribing the music, and writing
theories about it. He shared these
protessional items, as well as slides
he has taken while working there and
anecdotes about his experiences with
the Greek people and their customs.

A specialist in the music of the
Cyclades island group, Dr. cniams
played some recordings of light and
lively music from that area, which
he then contrasted to heavier, more
heroic mainland styles. The differ
ence in the music, he feels, stems
from the personalities ofthepeople.
In order to understand the songs
you must understand the people.
And il is difficult togeneralizeabout
musical styles, because anyonevile
lage probably has a completely dit-
terent repertoire train a village iive
miles away
For westerners, Greek folk music
is technically unusual, as is shown
in their use of diflerent scales and
meters. Thesound and derivationis
more Middle Eastern thanEulgarian
ar Yugoslavian, and the meter,orten
in 5, 'I, 9, or even 2‘5. is divisive,
made up or groups or two and three
beats (tor example, the beat ot a
song in 7/5 is Xxx Xx Xx) Greek
instruments, including the santouri,
bouzouki, zurna, nughera, lyra,
gaida, laouto, and baglama, are

§

Gaida
(Goatskin)

sources at rich and unusual sounds,
rolk songs, however, are begin,
ning to see the use ot accordions
Ltnd, more generally, folk music is
slowly being overcome by the pop-
ular music or Greece, yust like vil-
lages are being progressively wes-
ternized. Since Greek music has all
been carried in the oral tradition,
most commonly passed from grand,
mother to grandchildren, Dr.
chianis is trying to recordas much
at it as he can, especially that of
old people, and get it written down
before it is losl. He is doing this
mainly tor the Greek people, so they
will have their talk heritage contin-
ually available to them.

Slides of old shepherds, fathers
with sons, women on the doorstep

(their gossip place), and local scen-
ery, showed the workerrmusicians
beautiiully, and hinted at what Mr.
Chianis stressed, that music and
celebrations are an integral part of
the Greek spirit and their way of
lite

The Music at Greece, which Dr,
Chianis helped put together, is an
excellent recording With accom-
panying booklet or comments and
photos, and is available [or $4.95

Law School: Requires Willingness, Commitment

by dc. Lahowitz

(Ed. note: to. Labowitz, star col~
umnist tor the sub two years ago, is
presently attending Southern Metho-
dist University Law School. At the
request oi Associate Dean oi stu-
dent Affairs Jim Tederman, he has
written the tollowing article’con—
earning his own experiences tor
current Grinnellians thinking of at—
tending law school. We’re morethan
happy to welcome him back.)

For about 125 years, law school
has been one of the things that Grinr
hell graduates do after Grinnell.
The last couple at years have seen
a whole lot oi Grinnell grads, and
lots or other people, trying to get
into law schools. and some have not
been successful. But some of those
who do apply and then go to law
school do so in a very haphazard
way, such that their chances for
admission, and then success when
they are in law school, areimpaired,
Having sniiered through a massive
culture shock while enduring the
first year of law school, I was asked
to otter some help to those who are
currently struggling with the possir
bility or applying to and then attenr
ding law school. All I can otter are
my experiences and those second-
hand stories or my triends at other
law schools, and lots at generalir
zatlons that I hope apply to most
law schools.

There are two separate questions
involved here: first, the decision to
go to law school at all; and then,

First things first Law School is
not Grinnell College. Law school is
not a social science, consciousness—
raising, howetorsaveetheeworld eXr
perience, at least not the first year.
Across the board, at the most 5007
ially-conscious universities as well
as those at the other extreme, law
schools are the bastions of the Pro,
testant ethic, success-oriented,
competitive, conservative. A large
percentage at those attending law
school anywhere are there to make
money, lots at it, Believeit--y0u will
be going to school With a lot oi
people who are just not at Grinnell
in any great numbers, and you will
probably have trouble identiiying
with them and their goals In addi—
tion, to make (in understatement,
legal education is not veryprogrese
sive. The nature ot lawﬁstatusquo,
processoriented, businesserelated
”tends to be conservative and at-
tract conservative people as admin-
istrators, professors, and students.

Learning Law

Law schools see their function as
training lawyers. Now, many of
those in law school may not want
to be practicing attornles (and 40%
will not go into practice of law),
but that does not change the basic
function of law school Particularly
in the ﬁrst year, it will heimpresscd
upon you that you are learning law

quires a commitment. and law schr
ools are seeking to cull out those

who are neutral to the idea or those
just passing a pleasant tew years
looking tor a direction. The chart
and commitment involved in law sch-
ool, particularly in the iirst year,
are tremendous, and there really
isn’t room tor indecision. Eithel‘you
must commit yourselt to working exr
tremely hard and submersing your-
sell in law school, or you will have
diiticulty putting up with the whole
thing and leave, it there is any in-
decision in your mind as to whether
you really want to go through what
law school is, i would say you will
be better on taking on a year and
make a decision betore you start.

Having built a case against law
school, let me detend it tor a while.
The educational system may be ctr»
chaic, the professors patronizing oi
students (and almost universally
sexist), and the Justice system in
America almost completely screwed
up, but the education seems to be
worth the eitort involved in getting
the degree. Most importantly, law
is the process tor change and tor
action. even at the same time that
it is the vehicle tor the status quo.
Very early in law school you realr
ice that this is where it can happen,
where you can do something and see
some results The degree is a real
tool tor whatever you want to make
with it Most significant to me is
that you learn much more than just
law..you learn how to think and to

analyze, and to study. Then it is just

a matter of how that is applied, in

law practice or elsewhere
Be objective

Whether you are still undecided or
in the midst oi applying, lthik the
ﬁrst thing you should do is go over
to lowa City (or any law school)
and see what the thing is like. i
mean, study it, study what thosepeo-
ple are doing, be objective, put your-
sell in that situation, talk to peo-
ple doing what you will he doing
(it is amazmg to me tiow nonclnilant

my class was in deciding to go to
law school, like it was a decision
about where to go tor Thanksgiving
break.) Use some care and take some
time and effort. Talk to Grinnell
people who are at Iowa and see what
they thinkerebbie Nye Nathanson
”71, Greg Vranicar ‘72, Bob Lebell
‘70, Neil and Dane Onerheim, Mark
Meyer ‘72, andothers areoverthere
and I am Sure that they will help
you out. Take the time to go over
thereuand get an idea about law
school you can’t get trom Barron's.

In applying to schools, be realise
tic about your own qualiiications.
Apply to where (1) you have some
chance or getting in and (2) you might
like to spend at least 3 years.
Competition is sofiercethat“sale”
schools are rare anymoreBuidon't
overlook your state university law
school, since you have as good a
chalice there as anywhere. Outside of
the outstanding schools (Harvard,
Michigan, etc.) and then the very
good schools(Georgetown, Hastings,
etc ), most law schools fit inlo 2
categories, and all the schools in
each caiagory are pretty much the
same. lowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin,
Washington U. are all national law
schools, which means you have the
flexibility at being able to go any
where and practice. The other cata—
gory is local schools,,tike Drake or
Kansas U., which arepreparinglawe
yers to practice in those areas
So you have to be pretty certain at
where you plan to practice it you go
to one of those,

clinical Programs

There are some things you can
learn about the school trom its catae
log. See it they call themselves a
national or a local school. National
schools are universally ot better rer
putations than local. Check the lib—
rary lacilities. Seewhat coursesare
ottered and emphasizednliusiness
and tax, criminal law, philosophy at
law, “action" courses on rights and

issues (women, environment), etc.

A real good indicator oi the pro-
gressiveness oi the school is the cl
nical program—~the programs for
practice in legal aid clinics during
law school. More progressive
schools will have more and Varied
programs, or even require clinical
wor . Check onthe requirementsior
graduation--that can beabig hassle,
it you don’t want to study income
tax and it is required. See what the
governance of the school is like -
that can indicate a general attitude
towards students, which is generally
highly patronizing. Students have
just recently begun to participate
in law school governance.

Are You Willing
in sum, law school is dtiiicuit to
get into, and then is ditticult to
put up with once you are there. it
you are willing to make the effort
and submerge yourselt in it, then
there isn't much question that you
will be able to get through. Idon’t
know if tor any one individual it
is the best education atter Grinnell
vanyone applying to law school
should check into other graduate
programs like Urban Studies and

Public Affairs, partly as a safety
valve in case all those law schools
turn you down (you can go to grad
school, get a master's and reapply
to law school With much more chance
at success). But check into such al-
lernatives and see if there is some-
