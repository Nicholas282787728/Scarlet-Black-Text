NYC outlook grim _

by Dave Wick

Last night, Ray Horton, alumnus

and former iaculty member of

’ ' Grinnell, lectured on the financial
status of New York City. Horton,
present staff director of New
York’s Temporary Commission on
City Finances. brieﬂy summarized
the history of New York’s financial
situation citing various reasons ior
the potential deiauit.

According to Horton, the basic
problem has arisen because

{leaders of New York have com-
mitted almost a decade of errors in
the area of money management.
Former Mayor John Lindsay had a
liberal activist philosophy and a

Qiegislator's spirit. Therefore, he
lacked the ability to manage the
city iinancially, Horton stated.

The city was also receiving large

, sums of state and federal money

.Qwhich was not needed. Con-
sequently, the money was spent
before the end of each fiscal year,
However, these increased eXs
penditures were not going to public
services but, rather, to objects oi
no measurable increases and
output.

A third major factor presented
by Horton was that New York
never recovered from the national
recession of 1969-70 Yet, the city
. continued to spend when it had no
-l¥more income. instead of cutting
expenditures or raising taxes, the
banks began to borrow and created

‘_ growing debts.

Future prospects for New York

bare not too hrightpsaid Horton. He
expects the work force to lose
100,000 people within the next five
years and, with unemployment at
its present rate, these workers will
not have much chance in the job
market. Horton believes that the
city must Cut one billion dollars
from its spending within the next
three years to avoid worsening the
situation,

Theepresent administration is

laying oii fire, police, and
sanitation workers in order to stir
up complaints. They hope this will
inrce the state to produce iinancial
assistance. However, sharp ser»
vice losses will result, Horton feels
an alternate method should be
utilized that would not bite into the
work force. ,

Horton commented that with so
many commercial industries
leaving the city to find cheaper
oiiice space, the number oi empty
offices is on the rise. He foresees a
drop in the cost oi this space
thereby prompting the return oi
these industries, Horton also ex»

pects depressed wages resulting
from unemployment. He feels
these two factors will contribute to
the salvation of New York,
Although the outlook is grim,
Horton feels that the chances
against default are fairly good. He
sees President Ford unable to deny
loans and loan guarantees to cities
if those cities do what he asks,
Horton added though, ”i am
convinced that default without
quick resolution will affect the rest
oi the country. It New York City
defaults, the borrowing market
dries up and produces shock
throughout the country.”

:Grant aids flexibility

by Lynn Voedisch

Expansion of curricular ol-
ferings and improvement of
faculty will be the major benefits
of the $200,000 Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation grant which the
College is to receive. The fivesyear
faculty development program will
be used to “meet new priorities in
liberal arts education."

President A. Richard Turner
said that expansion of existing

idepartmcntal programs or the
development oi new inter-
departmental studies will be the
major considerations for the use of
the new grants. Funds from the

” grant will be used to provide new

., study and training opportunities
ior senior raculty members,
particularly in th humanities and
social sciences (1' ans,

Turner said senior taculty
members may use the grant funds
to strengthen themselves in an
established area of their field, to
move out to the periphery of a
quickly-moving field, or to prepare
themselves for a new inter-

disciplinary program.

Dean of the College and
Executive VicesPresident Waldo
Walker, and Dean oi Curriculum
Mary Eysenbach will supervise the
procedure ior implementing the
grant and devise an appropriate
program for next year. Topics
which have been suggested for
consideration are: Rural Studies,
international Studies, and
Women’s Studies.

Turner stressed that no program
has been decided on although the
grant had been anticipated. “The
area we focus on will be decided by
where upcoming discussions go,"
he said. He stressed that Student
and departmental input will be
instrumental in the final decision
making process, and hopes that all
interested parties will present
suggestions to Deans Walker and
Eysenbach.

The laculty member chosen to
benetit from the grant will spend
time; probably a semester, in
normal advanced graduate work

or as a visiting scholar under the
direction oi a university specialist,
in order to gain new cxperience,

ii the faculty member leaves
campus, the protessor will be
replaced by a person who will
continue the traditional or related
offerings and advise in the for-
mulation of the new program.

Visiting scholars will come to
Grinnell during the year to aid in
developing the program. and
Grinnell faculty members will
work through the summer on the
program. Also, funds will be
available to individual faculty
members {or summer research
directed at gaining competence to
undertake new programs.

After five years, symposia will
be held for faculty from other
colleges to share the research
results of the program.

Turner hopes that the benefits of
the Mellon grant program will
offset some of the restrictions
which the college will ieel due to
faculty cuts.

Willard Depree. African specialist, discusses the U.S.-African policy
conflicts of the 197ﬂ's with students and faculty members.

Depree: racial strife
crucial to Africa

by Debbie Weiner

Roberts Lecturer Willard
Depree, a member of Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger’s Policy
Planning Staff, was on campus
Monday and Tuesday. He talked to
several classes, ate with students,
and on Monday night spoke on
us rAfrican relationships, Depree
was graduated from Harvard
University and taught political
science at the University of
Michigan berore moving on to the
State Department where he has
served tor two decades. Among
many foreign service assignments
he has held posts in Ghana, Egypt,
and Sierra Leone.

Dcpree identifies the conﬂicts
between southern white Airicia
and black Africa as the major
problem confronting America in
respect to African relationships.
The State Department wants South
Africa to reduce apartheid. and is
in favor of self-determination in
the Portugese colonies, America
has supplied aid to various nations
to this end,

However, with successful
economic interests in South Africa,
and a long history of friendship,
Depree said, America is unwilling
to take decisive steps against her.
(We vetoed the expulsion of South
Africa from the U.N.) As black
Africa calls [or definite action, the
U.S. is caught in the middle.

“In the United Nations, we're in
a heap of trouble" over white
Africa, said Depree The unified
Voting bloc of black African
nations constitutes a powerful
force in the U.N.

Depree charged that Congress is
hindering efforts to push white
Airica towards racial equality by
refusing to impose a trade em-
bargo on Rhodesia. An . arms
embargo is already in eiiect. ”I

share the impatience of the black
Africans,” he stated. Unless the
trade embargo is enacted, he feels
no Substantial shift in policy will
come about.

Our policy in regard to South
Africa is one of “communication
and restraint.” The State
Department encourages American
firms in South Africa to promote
racial equality, but meets with
little success, Many American
diplomatic posts have been filled
by blacks and all State Department
functions in South Africa are in-
tegrated, The State Department
supports citizen groups which try
to tight apartheid, and the US,
does not sell arms to South Africa.

America’s ambivalent stand
about South Airica and our past
support of Portugal have hurt our
relations with black Africa. We
continue to send aid to many
nations, but in some cases the sum
is nominal. As a result, states
Depree, “We have become less
relevant to the . . . black Africans. '
The Third World’s newfound
political power, especially in the
U.N,, has contributed to’ this."

Another major reason for the
someivhat strained relations with
Africa is the relatively low priority
given it by the State Department,
according to Depree. US. interests
in Africa are small Compared with
our interests in other parts of the
world.

Strategically and economically.
American interests in Africa are
few. However, America does have
a real interest in Africa as a future
source of raw materials,
Politically, oi course, America
wants Airican support. since
African countries constitute Over
one-third of the votes in the U.N.
Their help_is needed, said Depree,
in solutions to global problems.
