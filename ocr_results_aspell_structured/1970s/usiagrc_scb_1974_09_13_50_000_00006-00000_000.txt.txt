City reiuvinafes Arbor Lake

By Anne Deiiiiiioit

The remains of Arbor Lake,
located in the southwest corner of
Grinnell, consist of a large, silt-
filled, L-shaped basin surrounded
by a wooded area. The lake bed is
overgrown wttli grasses, A thin
stream gurgles as it cuts its way
through the moist, sandy bed. A
muddy path, otten obstructed by
tree roots, runs along the north
side of the lake. Because trees
block most oi the direct sunlight,
the air is cool and fresh along the
shaded trail.

Walking along the path, one can
visualize the Arbor Lake of the
past, Arbor Lake was once a
popular resort and the site or a
wide variety oi recreational and
entertaining activities.

concerts, such as pertonnanc - by
a local mandolin and guitar group,
were popular at the lake‘s handr
stand. Fishing, swimming, and
boating were standard pastimes at
the lake.

During the winter, ice skating
was a nightly occurence, Each
evening someone would build it tire
on the bank to warm icy skaters.
According to a 1914 issue or the
Grinncll llcrnld, automobiles
would shinet ' eadlights on the

in 1921, several people reported
seeing an alligator in in the waters
of Arbor Lake. The alligator was a
pet oi a woman in the Grillnell
area. “A woman even committed
suicide there,” shuddered Mrs, J,
D. Stoops, curator of the Grinnell
Historical Museum.

Financial History

Arbor Lake has a long and
complicated linanclal history. In
1902, the Grinnell Water Company
came into existence and by 1903 the

company had created a soil water’

lake for manufacturing purposes
The Grinnell Outing Club. formerly
the Grinnell Gun Club, leased the
lakefront area in response to a
popular demand tor boating and
skating A tree planting campaign
was‘also conducted. Clty Manager
Ted Clausen speculates that the
name Arbor Lake may have been
an outgrowth oi that campaign.
From 1902 until 1914, [\rbor Lake
experienced tunes of both great
popularity and disuse, Because the
recreational aspccts oi the lake
were secondary to its orgiual
purpose, private iundlng to
maintain the lake as a resort was
oltcn lacking. During the 1920's the

city of Grinnell recognized= the
maintenance of Arbor Lake as a
community matter. Since that
time, the city‘s role with regard to
Arbor Lake has been repeatedly
Considered.

Due to water Contamination,
swimming in Arbor Lake was
prohibited in 1949. The tollowing
year. a tank Car of ammonia burst,
spilling its contents into the stream
which led the lake. As a resultv
most of the lake‘s aquatic life was
killed. In 1968, Arbor Lake was so
badly polluted that a deClSlon was
made to drain the lake Within three
years of that date.

The 1973 Park, Recreation Area,
and Open Space Plan tor the city of
Grinnell presents possible plans
tor an Arbor Lake development
project. The purpose oi developing
the Arbor Lake area would be ti)
create a community-wide park
offering a wide range of
recreational facilities. The
development would also ease the
strain on other Grinnell parks,

Development

Theoretically, the development
would be done in stages, whenever
adequate lunds are available tor
various parts or the proyect, The
ﬁrst stage would include Clean-UP,
erosion control, construction ol an
entrance and parking area, sewer
and water service, and shelters,

During the last stage trails,
picnic arc-as, a playground, and an
open ganic ticld might be added

city Manager Ted Clausen
reported that the general intention
now is to restore the lake bed and
I‘e-crcate the lake “Plans \\'Ill
come to (I head in the next few
months." commented Clallsen,

In late September. the city will
entertain bids [rum contractors to
remove the silt [mm the lake bed
If restoration is definitely rlccldcrl
upon, work will begin during the
coming construction season
Regarding whctlicr the plans will
actually be implemented. Clausen
concluded, “We'll have a better
idea this fall."

Larry

byFriInklinStoler

Larry Coryell has long been
regarded as one oi the better
guitarists in the jazz world. In the
60’s and until the past two years,
his talents were basically
unrecognized. During this time he
rronted a small group, usuallv
quartet or quintet 7

However, as word about Coryell
spread, he began to change. He
attempted singing, which be
abandoned after the initial try. He
then began to play at rock concert
halls. and started attracting in-
torest with the rock audience.

This past year saw Coryell's
most dramatic change, the tor»
lllation oI the Eleventh House.
Supposedly, it was to fill the space
left vacant by the breakup ol the
Mahavishnu Orchestra,
