THE SCARLET AND BLACK

BBers Lose Three, End 2-20

The Grinnell Pioneers' bas-
ketball season ended on a dis-
mal note as they lost their
three games by wide margins.
The Pioneers nosed theirfinal
season's record to 2- 20 over
all and to 2716 in the Confer-
ence as they got creamed by
St. Olaf, 107767, demolished
by Carleton, 91-72, and
mopped up by Coe, 106-76.

Against St. Olaf, fouls, for

once, were no problem as the'

Pioneers kept fairly even with
the Oles. Instead, they were
outgunned from the field by
47 field goals to 25, as Grinv
nell put on a poor offense and
a poor defense. The first half
was a poor one as Grinnell
played lackadaisiaally; itend-
ed with the Pioneers on the
short end of a 50736 score.
The second halfwas Grinnell's
usual poor half; they played
even sloppier and were out-
scored 57-31 for the final
margin. Bob Burnett andGreg
Bombinski led Grinnell’s ofr
{enslve effort with 24 and 10
points, respectively. St. Olaf's
Don Halvorson led allscorers
with 26; EricBundgaardadded
19 for the Oles. '

The Carleton game was,very
nearly, a rehash of the St.
Olaf game. Grinnell did nor
play anywhere near as well

Alston 2nd

Last week in the conference
meet, Grinnell almost had a'
winner in Washington Alston.
He advanced to the finals in
the 177 lb. weight class on a
lastrsecond pin and a decision
in an overtime match. In the
championship event, Washwas
pinned in four minutes and
fourteen seconds in one of the
best matches of the meet.

Grinnell also had a fourth
place finisher in heavy-weight
Don Aldrich. Although he got
pinned twice, and infactnever
won, it probably was a just
reward for having to wrestle
whales and giants.

Grinnell won one Other match
as the old dude Steve Hutch-
ings won his first pairing

Saturday as they had three
weeks previously in their up~
set of the Carls. The Pioneers
kept the fouls down for the
second game in a row, but,
for the second game in a row,
the Pioneers were shot down
from the field to the tune of
37 goals to 26. The front half
ended with the Carls up 42~24.
However, this time, Grinnell
bounced back with a good half
as they matched Carleton point
for point down the stretch to
lose by only 91772. Burnett
and Bombinski again led Grin-
nell with 24 and 15 points.
Mark Wheeler and Stu Alexe
ander sparked Carleton with
19 and 18 points.

After getting laid low over the
weekend, the Pioneers were
unable to get it up against Coe
Tuesday night as the Pioneers
were blown off the court 106*
76. Grinnell actually was still
in the game after due firsthalf
ended; they trailed by only 9
at 49-40. However, in the sea-
son‘s finale, the SecondrHalf
Fade Syndrome hit hard. and
the Pioneers were hit hard in
the final half, being outscored
57-36i Tuesday's game saw
Grinnell get into foul trouble
again as the Pioneers not only
were outshor from the field,
40 buckets to 32,but they were

12-6, but then lost twice. He
almost proved that smoking
isn't too bad for you, or may
be he did?

Over all, Grinnell placed 7th
in the tenrteam conference
meet. Other members of the
team who went were Jack
Couch, Bob Donelan andErnie
Rose.

The season Is over andmany
are thankful. Being awrestler

a lot of missed meals

outscored from the Free Strip,
26-12, as well. Overall, the
Pioneers playedaprettyshod-
dy game as turnovers gave
Coe several easy fast break
buckets.

Tuesday night’s gme saw
Grinnell's fans in fine form,
however. Rarely has there
been the spontaneous display
of OBness that there was Tu-
esday. Indeed, the comments
about several Coe players'
personal habits (and even ab~
out Coe‘s cheerleaders, who
looked like a second string
Jr. High cheerleading team)
became so vociferous and
vehement that they prompted
a Coe fan to come across the
court and inform our fans of
what he thought about their
cheering. The Coe fan was
then given a standing ovation
by our guys, and, at the start
of the second half, several of
our larger fans went over to
the Coe side to keep the Coe
fan from getting lonesome.

Right on, guys. --r\a speaks

Silksters Surprise, Place 2nd

The mini-indoor track sea-
son drew to a close last Sat»
urday with the Pioneers placr
ing a surprising second. Led
by an inspired Coach M¢do~
welingrrod, Grinnell finished
ahead of everyone (including
Chicago University) except for
Carleton. The meet was not
close as Carleton had70 points
to Grinnell’s 54.

Barrel] Huff was the biggest
man in the shot put as he sent
the poundage 46' 9" for a gold
medal. Charlie McGrath won
the two mile run in a great
effort for the little man The
only other first place was in
the distance medley relay in
which Philos Morales, Billy
Swan, Charlie, and Eric Jahn
went the distance.

Eric, Charlie, and Philos
teamed up with Scott Weil to
place second in the two mile
relay. Their time was a min-
ute faster than Chuck alone
ran the event, for those who
are interested.

In the polish vault, the Alton
acrobats placed second and
third, with Chrisy beating
Dougie. Also coming in third
from Clark second was Jim
Pirolli in the high jump. Jon
gray overcame many obsta-
cles as he placed third and
fifth in the hurdle events. The
mile relay of Swan, Bill Sch-
ooler, Paul Lewis, and the
”Shorewood flash" Curt Gor-
rell ran in third position.
In other relay events, Grinr
nell took fourth in the 880
relay and fifth in the sprint
medley. Unveiled in those eV’
ents were Paul Lewis, Carl
Brenner, and Mark Siegfried.
This second place is definr
itely net a discredit to the
team, as was the swim meet
fiasco. The team placed much
higher than expected and is
looking forward to the outdoor
season and Grinnell’s only
possible team championship
this year. Another chance,

Grinnell Swimmers lose Conference Meet

Unlike the other articles
about the GrinnellAqua Jocks,
this one will be slightly more
serious. The reason is that
this year’s MCswim meetwas
no laughing matter for the
previously jovial Grinnell
Aqua Jocks.

The Ripon Redmen unquestr
ionably swam well to defeat
the Arjocks, take Dilly the
Duck, and the first place tr07
phy. The finalscore was Ripon
81, Grinnell 71, Cornell 58,
etc, etc.

ley relay, Ripon eclipsed a
1968 mark; and in the SOOryard
freestyle, Andy Applebee of
Cornell bettered last year’s
record by three seconds.

Bruce J. Rollie was once
again the standout swimmer
for Grinnell. He outstroked
Ripon's Haffner in the 50 free,
and unleashed a winning an-

only other individual winner
for Grinnell. He bettered his
freshman mark in the 200 br-

honors.

Prep Roundbnllers
lose To End Season

Grinnell’s Young Pioneers
closed their season ona losing
note,’ just as their varsity
mentors did lastTuesday. The
preps, however, made a game
of it while losingto Coe 96795,
to drop their season’s record
to 2-9.

The preps generally followed
a version of the varsity's los-
ing script in playing one good
half and one bad half. True to
form, however, they couldn‘t
follow the varsity's example
accurately, as they put their
good half last. Playing slop-
pily, the Young Pioneers tr-
ailed by 59-32 at the half,
but, on the strength of Bill
Bailey’s gunning (he finished
with 36 points) and solid play
by Dennis Moss and Jeff Jen-
sen, the preps came storming
back in the second half, out
scoring Coe's freshmen
63’37. The rally fell short,
however, and Grinnell's basr
ketball tradition was keptalivc

as the preps lost 96-95.
