- Gregg Golden will study civil

rights in England, France, and
Norway next year under a $7,000
Watson Fellowship recently
awarded him. He will compare the
civil rights of citizens of those
countries to the First Amendment
rights oi Americans by speaking
with proiessors oi law. members oi
the legal protession, and jourv
nalists; completing legal
researc and observing current
trends in each country.

One of the largest obstacles that
Golden foresees in his study is
learning to read Norwegian He
also anticipates some difficulties
with the governments oi each
country: the Norwegian govern
ment will offer little assistance in
his study, but it won't block him, he
thinks, While France will be
“somewhat reluctant” to help him,
“especially in view oi the student
riots and strikes of the late ‘605.”

Golden spent a semester in
England with the InterFuture
Program and studied a local olice
iorce in northeastern Englan , but
only aiter initially being denied
permission by the British govern
ment to do the research, on the
ground that his topic was “sen-
sitive and controversial." His topic
was the restrictions placed on the
police in the areas oi Search,
seizure, arrest, and interrogation.

Before spending his semester in
England, Golden had studied the
same topic with the Grinnell Police
Department through six months oi
observation while riding with the
police, as a research project for a
course. The first night Golden rode
with the police was the night that
The Number was raided, and
Golden nearly had his head
knocked off when a patron mistook
him ior a narcotics agent. The
Grinnell research became the first
hali oi the InterFuture project.

The fellowship, which was
granted to 71 students in the
country. is given by the Thomas J.
Watson Foundation in memory oi
the founder of International
Business Machines Corporation,
Thomas J. Watson, Sr. Golden
plans to begin his iellowship in the
fall.

it can be shared with others, we

The Pub Club is operating in the
black, has repaid half its loan, and
has hired Paul Gertman as the tulle
timc manager ior next year.

Last year, the Pub Club trana
sacted approximately $30,000
worth oi business, The expense oi
beer, soda, snacks, and other
edible items ran about $15,000,
while other costs, such as wages,
taxes, insurance, and advertising,
totaled another $15,000. The net
proﬁt irom operatio1s amounted to
a little over woo, which, together
with $1200in membership iees, was
paid out to the loan irom the
college trustees.

The trustees loaned the Pub
$6.000 to get started. The
agreement was to repay the loan
within 24 months if possible. The
time on the loan will run out at the
end oi May, but manager Mark
Nissen ioresees total repayment oi
the loan by then as “close to ime
possible.” The loan, Nissen stated,
will probably be renewed and paid
in full next year. Last year, $2,500
of the loan was returned and
another $500 was paid in January,
leaving only $3,000 unpaid. A
return to the members might be
possible next year, Nissen
predicted, once the loan has been
paid and suiiicient equipment is
installed.

The proiits and membership iees
irom this year have been spent on
equipment such as chairs, bar
stools, and a tap box, costing ap-
proximately $15,000. Last semester
$332 was brought in by mem-
bership sales with an additional
$400 received this semester as of
February, and each month has
showed a proiit.

The Pub employs 19 students,
who are hired through the
Financial Aid Office. Ap-
prox1mately $9.000 has been
salaried to students whose wages
are set according to responsibility
and seniority as employees.

Paul Gertman, '74, has been
hired by the Pub Club Board of
Directors, and will replace Nissen
during exam week in May. A new
board will be elected in April at the
annual stockholders’ meeting. This
meeting will discuss the financial
status of the Pub and use of profits,
as well as elect the board. The
board sets policy for the Pub and
makes financial decisions. It has
been much stronger this year than
last, according to Nissen, and has
run the Pub. The precedent has
been established, he believes, for a
strong, active hoard to run the club
and direct the manager.

People interested will submit
their names to the Board for
consideration, The Board will
narrow the names and present
them to Pub members ior a vote,
Chairman of the Board Bob
Winters said. Three faculty and
student positions on the board will
be elected. . .

gets
protests

The Varsity News Stand, located
at 017 Broad Street, received
complaints last Friday irom un»
named persons who alleged that
obscene material was on display
Where minors could view it. The
complaints were brought to the
attention of David Danforth,
Varsity owner, by the Grinnell
Police and County Attorney Don
Schild. No charges were filed.

The major part oi the complaint,
according to Schild, was the’
visibility oi the back portion oi the
store, which minors are not
allowed to. enter due to the
“hardcore” nature of the items in
that section. “The objection is not
that these materials exist, but that
they are placed where minors can
see them while walking to the pop
machine or pinball machines in the
hack of the store," Schild eXe
plained,

A curtain has been ordered by
Daniorth to comply with the
complaint, but he will hang it on a
conditional basis. if the curtain too
greatly obstructs his Vision of the
area, it will be removed.

Danforth has removed Male and
Stng magazines to the hack sec
tion, along with some other
magazines which have recently
changed editorial policies and now
print covers displaying iull frontal
nudity. These magazines were due
to be moved to the back, Danforth
said, although the complaints
moved him to do it sooner.

National Lampoon 199th Bir-
thday Book and Apple Pie remain
on the shelves outside the closed
area, although complaints were
made against these. “I won’t move
ones like National Lampoon. 1 told
them (Schild, Police Chief Bill
Peters, and Detective sgt. Darrell
Lamb) that we could have a
committee come in and suggest
What to do with these magazines,
then take the matter to court.”
Danfurth said.

Danforth remarked that most
people who have comented on the
complaints “think they are
ridiculous charges' . “Most people
know what’s in here; if they don't
like it, they Won't come in." The
complainants are “so concerned
about a little bare skin, when
nothing is said about the blood,
guts, and violence on a lot oi
Covers, such as Wrestling
Magn'Linc.”. .
