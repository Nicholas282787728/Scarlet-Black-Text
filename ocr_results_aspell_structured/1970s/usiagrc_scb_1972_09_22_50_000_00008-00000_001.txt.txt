Five Haiku of Summer

Sunrised pollen cloud -
raven winging lo Iall iir
lo gaze on day binlii

Vellowed hemlock needles

weave through the still summer air
sound of their falling.

Swaying wilh me wind:

the bobbing yellow voices
of the sunflowers.

Stirred from his sleep

my puppy biles (hrough the air,
chasing spunering flies.

One crickelâ€™s creaky song -
and through the swirling clouds
bursting yolk oi the moon!

S.T. Wellman
