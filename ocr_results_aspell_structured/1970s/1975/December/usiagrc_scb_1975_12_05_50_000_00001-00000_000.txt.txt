:And Mozart used
ca clavichord . . .

by Tom Palltea
Electronic sounds, some
familiar and some not. have been
issuing from the small room next
to the elevator in the Fine Arts
Building. The room, not much
bigger than a typical dorm room, is
the music department’s studio run
.py Alan Leichtling and is used
basically for the composition
course.

, Unlike his predecessor, Eric
cwis, whose classes worked more
with live performances, Leichtliog
has his students deal more with the
study of completed compositions
and with the technical procedures
involved with electronic media. As
Leichtling understands it, Lewis
saw electronic music as the music
of the future, while he himself feels
that it is not the ultimate, but just
another media that can be used in
conjunction with other established
ones.

However, use of the studio has
not been always a satisfying ex
‘perience this semester due Ito
massive mechanical failures. The
udio was not operable until
October, and since then the syn-

thesizer and three of the four
Q

speaker systems have become
nonfunctional. Due to the fact that
most of this equipment will have to
be sent out for repairs over
Christmas vacation, and that new
equipment worth about $4000 has
not arrived yet, Leichtling doubts
if the studio will open at the
beginning of second semester.
However, he feels that by the fall of
1976 the studio should be running
smoothly without the constant
worries of equipment breaking
down.

Most of the refurbishing of the
studio, Leichtling said, is being
financed by a generous grant front
Dean Walker's budget. He ex
plained further that the whole
music department is being shown
great generosity by the ad-
ministration, which he feels is
definitely needed to get the
department back on its feet. With
five of the seven instructors in the
department new to the faculty this
year, Leichtling sees a new
beginning that will lead to “a good
department in the framework of a
liberal arts school."

epartments split cuts

by Janet Pope is Lynn Voediseh

Acting upon the Board of
Trustees recommendation that
three faculty positions be cut for
academic year 1976-77, the
Executive Council voted to make
fractional cuts within various
departments. The art department
will lose threersixths position;
theater, onersixth; economics, one
sixth; history 1 (there will be no
replacement ior a sabbatical
vacancy); physical education,

Practicum credits examined

by Rosa Miclinya
and Debbie Weiner

Practicum credits provide a
chance for students to receive
credit for participating in various

ﬁtivities. The music, theatre,
nthropology and physical
education departments all offer
n acticum courses.
.In the music department, one

wredit each is given for par-
ticlpation in the orchestra, singers,
chorus, collegium musicum, and
the gospel choir. It is possible for
students to enroll in more than one

"practicum per semester. However,
a maximum of eight credits may
count toward graduation.
Associate Music Professor James
Wyly sees a “terrible problem” in
this limitation for some students.
Pcople who want to enroll in more
than one practicum per semester

'ght be inhibited from doing so

ecause, after the maximum of

eight credits is reached, no more
credit will be given. However. he
pointed out that the Eight credit
limitation was the result of a
.culty-wide decision made after
careful deliberation two years ago.
Thc decision applies to all areas of
‘practicum credit.

Theatre 101 offers credit for
“participation in a theatrical
production in a position of major
responsibility." Generally, a

istudent earns one to three credits
per semester. Students can earn

two credits for a major role in a
major production, or for a major
position on the technical crew. One
credit is given to students who play
a minor part in any area of theatre

production. Sandy Moffett, theatre

department chairman, said that
credit is given not as an
”evaluation of role performance.”
but for participation and come
pletion of the work,

The Physical Education
Department gives credit for
participation in intercollegiate
sports, physical activity in
struction and performance clubs
such as fencing, folk dancing, and
modern dance, Participating in
intercollegiate athietics earns one
credit for two seasons, receiving
instruction is worth one-fourth
credit each half semester, and
belonging in clubs earns one credit
for two seasons,

The anthropology department
has offered various practica
throughout the years, including
Museum Display Design and
Experimental Archaeology. This
year, Anthropology 103 is being
offered for advanced students for
one credit, Students in this course
serve as assistants or discussion
leaders for introductory anthro
classes. It offers students a chance
to look at this subject from a diia
[erent perspective, according to
department chairman Ralph

Leubben, in that there can be a
practical application of course
material. In addition, some
students have enjoyed the op»
portunity to lead discussion
sessxons. .

Dean Mary Eysenbach reports
no major complaints with the
credit system. but she would like to
see practicum programs in the
form of field Work in more
departments.

President A. Richard Turner
believes the present system would
benefit from evaluation; “a total
look at the picture is needed.” The
system was not the result of any
“comprehensive design." Practica
credit programs have been in-
stituted one at a time on a random
basis. Changes in the system could
be made a number of ways. Credit
could be given for any “worthwhile
activity,” although the problem of
defining “worthwhile activity”
would arise. Another alternative
would be to consider all practica as
extra-curricular activities, and not
give any credit. He feels the an-
swer lies somewhere in between
these two extremes, with emphasis
placed on those activities that
“dovetail with classwork,” Ac
cording to Turner, “Credit should
be associated With academic en-
deavor.”

three-sixths; psychology, three-

sixths, and biology onefourth. The

cuts are designated in terms of
sixths because each professor
teaches six classes per year.

So far, departments have
decided to make cuts which affect
only professors who teach in part-
time positions; no iull faculty
positions have been eliminated.
lrving Fishman, biology depart
mentchairman, explained that one
position will be reduced from one
half to a fourth provided the
professor accepts the change. in
economics, chairman Robert
Voertman explained that a position
would also be reduced by a frac-
tion. The other departments have
not yet decided where they will
make cuts.

Chairperson of the iaculty,,Ar-
nold Adelberg, explained that
cutting from the departments was
a complicated and longrwinded
procedure. “Technically speaking
we tried to make cuts which would
cause us aslittle harm as we could.
in all cases when we had to cut, we
looked at size of the department,
looked at the personnel available,
and then decided which positions
could be cut up or down. In any
case it‘s much better to nibble
away at the partrlime positions
than to eliminate a position en-
tirely,” he explained.

According to Adelberg, there
was some feeling among the
faculty that a budget deficittcould
be accepted for next year to avoid
cuts in faculty positions. Such a
policy assumes that enrollment
will increase in the next few years.
However, the Trustees felt that this
wouldn’t be worth the risk.
Adelberg said that last year the
Council recommended that one and
one»half positions be sliced.
Adelberg explained that the
Trustees were dealing with
reduced enrollment figures when
they decided in favor of three cuts
this fall.

There has been some adverse
reaction among the faculty to the
restrictions for next year, but
Adelberg believes many un-

derstand the necessity of the
decision for next year's budget, at
least. The Executive Council is not
planning on cuts for the year after
next, but it is always conceivable
that they may be required.
Adelberg believes that additioml
restrictions will cause com
siderable unfavorable reaction
among the faculty. He sees
reductions as having a
demoralizing effect and en«
dangering the variety of innovative
programs which make Grinnell
unique.

“There will be more and more

internal pressure within the
departments as they worry more
and more about their own
programs being restricted,"
Adelberg noted. “Also, every time
there IS a Cut there is the risk of
making the school less attractive
to prospective students.”
' The administration, which will
study the feasibility of ad-
ministrative and service job cuts
this semester. gave the student-
faculty ratio as he crucial factor
for restricting faculty positions
first. The studentriaculty ratio,
currently approximately l:l0,
lower than that oi any other ACM
school, is the most clearly
recognizable fact the Trustees had
to work with at the present time.
There is at the present no
corresponding objective standard
for administration staffing.

Adelberg says that if enrollment
does increase for next year there
may be no need for additional cuts
in coming years, Currently the
college is appropriately staffed for
1250 students. If the College can
draw this many students the
financial problems may stabilize.

Presently, applications received
by the college are running about 40
ahead of last year at this time. D.
Nicholas Ryan, Dean of Ad-
missions and Financial Aid stated
that, considering recent trends,
this figure is encouraging.
However, he commented that it is
still too early to make any
predictions about next year's
enrollment. '
