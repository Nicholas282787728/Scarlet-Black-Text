Banana” last Saturday as the
Siwash won the Midwest Con-
fercnce swim title, beating
Grinnell 3204303, Ripon, in third
with 222 points, led the other eight
teams in the final standings. Still,
both Buddha and Grinnell’s fans
had plenty to smile about, para
ticiilarly the performance ol Bob
Winters.

wrap it up

by Rick Nightingale

MONMUUTH, ILL.7The
Pioneer matmen concluded their
season last weekend, placing
eighth at the Midwest Conference
Wrestling Tournament at Mon
mouth College. Although no
Pioneer wrestlers placed, five of
the seven wrestlers advanced to
the consolation semi-finals. 1W0
wrestlers, Mark Genereux at 150
and l-iosca Engram at 167,
narrowly missed placing in the top
four.

Ccncrcux lost his match against
Carleton by a score of so, and
Engram was defeated only in the
last ten seconds of his match
Engram also turned in a decision
in one match and a pin against
Carleton in another. Scott Beers
and Dan Mosby Won decisions.
Beers scored an 11-3 win over
itipon at 126 and Mosby won over
Lake Forest at 153, And Rick
Nightingale pinned Carleton's
Maureen Tumulty at 118.

The Pioneers could have finished
as high as fifth had it not been for
cricual injuries to Bo denosa and
Bob Donelan. Grinnell turned in its
most successful season in six
years, picking up two dual meet
wins. Several wrestlers turned in
winning seasons and all won at
least one match along the way.
chosa, at 190, led the Pioneers,
carning an til record before being
sidelined with a knee injury.

Grinnell loses seniors Mike
Darragh. Donelan, Genereux, and
Nightingale, but a nucleus of CX~
perienced wrestlers, headed by
deRosa, Engram, Mosby, and
Beers, will be returning. Next
year, Mo Hunt's grapplers should
lurn in even a belter season. with
an excellent shot at several in:
dividual championships and a high

tcam placing in the conference, ‘ ‘

Winters‘ victories were pool

isrcnce records). part of the
seventeen pool and nine MWC
records that were set in the two-
day meet.

Also on the victorious medley
relay were Greg Olson
ibreastrokel, John Chambers
lhutterflyl, and Tom Rowat
(freestyle). Olson provided exr
Citemcnt in the lOOrbreastroke
when John Lonnes of Cornell edged
him tor first by .02 seconds Olson,
as Doug Johnson did as a freshman
last year, dropped his times
considerably in taking iourth place
in the 200»breastroke and 2001M.
Johnson swam to fifth in the 500-
free, and slxths in the 1650 and 200-
freestyle events.

Chambers had intended to lake
the 400-[M final easy, saving
himself for the IODrbutlerfly final.
During the iM, though, Chambers
saw himself even with the field and
proceeded to finish fifth. He came
back to take third in the today and
fourth in the zonally. Winters‘
tsllow senior and coccaptain, Tom
Rowal. plcked up a fourth in the
IUD-backstroke and fifth places in
the many and ZOO-free. Though the
loss of Winters and Rowat's swim
talents, as they are graduating,
will be a large one, the loss of the
team leadership will be just as
large.

The coming prospects

Though he had never dived
before this year, Joe Wombach
showed good promise for the
future. taking fourth in the one-
meter diving, while teammate Ray
Bierstedt came on strong to ﬁnish
ninth. Another freshman showing
promise was Bob Nourse. who took
eleventh in the zoovl'ly Al Btesh
and Steve Miller sprinted to eighth
and tenth, respectively, in the loo-
trse on Friday; the next day they
finished fifth and eleventh in the 507
free. A] Six joined Olson with lime
drops in the breastroke, swimming
to fifth in the 100, and seventh in
the ZOO-breasimke. Also, Mark
Smiley swam a good 1650 for
Grinnell but just missed the top
twelve.

Steve Varick of Knox solid' ied
his claim as the conference's best
freestyler, winning the 200, 500,
and 1650, The latter two were in
pool and MWC record time while
the 200 was a pool mark, He also
anchored Knox’s winning BOO-free
relay. While Winters made the

backstroke look easy, Mike Mum
did the same in his specialty.
Owner of Knox's inﬂated banana,
Muro moved his 6'4" frame fast
enough to set pool and MWC marks
in the 100 and 2007fly. Knox simply
swam well enough when they had
to, winning the meet with a third
place in the 400-frce relay while lhe
Pioneers were seventh.

Grinnell's 400-medley relay and
ROD-free relay (Chambers, John
son, Rowat, and Winters) along
with Chambers in the ZOO-fly, Olson
ln the ZOO-breastroke, and Winters
in the backstroke events now go on
to the Division III nationals during
break,

_Alter the meet Grinnell coach
Ray Obcrmiller will be looking
back at the team’s improvement
ovér the pastseason, and on to next
year and the task of replacing
Btesh, Bierstedt, Rowat, and
Winters.

we're void in a few, too,” he said,
The Contenders

Probably the Fioncers’s best
chance for a win lies with triple
jumper Miks Nadalsky. Nobody in
the Conference has yet topped his
performance in that event,
Nadalsky is also strong contender
in the long jump.

Jim Briles is considered one of
the top contenders in the 600, and
Jim Fallace could take the 440.
Coach Van Scatter is also op-
timistic about the chances of the
mile relay team, all the members
of which run subrsérsecond 440's.
Others who could place in their
events are Tcrry Seeberger, Mark
Blanchard, Mark Schultz, and
Mark Bailey.

Last Thursday, Grinnell was
defeated by Coe and St. Amborse,
but topped Iowa Wesleyan in a
quadrangular meet. Nadalsky was
the only Grinnell champion in that
meet, triple jumping an excellent
43"11” . Nadalsky also placed Scond
in the long jump.

Other placers included Briles,
second in the 60 : Raub, third in
the mile with 4:25. , Schultz, third
in the 60 and in the 220 hurdles;
Fallace, third in the 440:
Seeberger, third in the 1,000;
Bowman, third in the 300; and Tom
Howland, finishing a strong third ,

Bailey. Haigh lead cagers to success

by Dow Calvert

Bill Bailey and John Haigh
finished first and second in Mid-
west Conference scoring and
Grinnell boosted itself to its best
basketball season in five years
Saturday by defeating Carleton
handily, 82- 67. The Pioneers
dropped a heartbreaker the
previous evening to Cornell, losing
in overtime, 62759,

Bailey and l-iaigh, who had en-
tered the final weekend tied point
for point for loop scoring honors.
very nearly finished in an actual
tic. Bailey's two-game total of 37
(19 and to) gave him an 18.25
average and edged Haigh's so 114
and 22) for the crown.

Bailey, a senior, is the first
Pioneer basketball conference
scoring leader in over a decade,
accomplishing what Grinnell‘s Jim
Mifflin did in 1963764, back when
current athletic director John
Ptitsch Still coached basketball.
This is the first time ever that
Grlllncll has boasted the top two
scorers in the conference.

The bad old (lays

Gl‘inncll seems to have moved
into a new era in baskctball. This
year saw the arrival ol 8 new and
ficl'y head coach, Ron Mitchell, as
well as a’ top notch junior varsity

mentor; John llickS~HCrshey, This

year saw none of the highly
publicized quitting incidents of
previous seasons, and fewer of
those careless Snickers on the
parts of students when the team
lost. Finishing 8714 for the season,
and 6-10 in conference action, the
Pioneers pulled off their best effort
since the 1969-71) cagers had the
same results.

Since [963794, the last time a
Grinnell basketball team put
together a season winning record,
Grinnell has been, not including
this year, 41-175. In four oi those
years, the Scarlet and Black nailed
a pitiful two wins for the entire
year,

Grinnell vs. Cornell

Friday night's contest pitted the
Grinnellians against a strong
Cornell team, and the game was
knotted Virtually throughout. It
was tied 28~2Sat the end of the half,
and aitcr a scesawing second
stanza it came up lied again, this
time at 55-211]. The five minute
overtime period wllich followed
proved to be all Cornell, however,
and the Rams walked bit with a 627
59 decision, Cornell became only
the third team lo beat Grinnell
twice this year, the other two
doublerwinners being number four
Lake' Forest and number one Coe.

Bailey tallied 19 against Cornell,
Haigh added 14, and Gunnar Thors
another 10. Gary Van Gorp led the
Rams with a 22-point performance.

Five players for Grinncll hit in
double figures in the Saturday tilt,
however, and Carleton found itself
outplayed throughout. Although
the Carls stayed within three in the
first half, a Pioneer burst in the
second round, triggered by Haigh,
catapulted the hometowncrs to an
insurmountable 13-point ad»
vantage with 4:24 remaining,

Moments later, Coach Mitchell
began to withdraw his starters,
beginning with seniors Bailey and
Rick Williams. The two received a
standing ovation from the wildly
partisan crowd lasting several
minutes, No sooner had the crowd

settled, when Halgh look a seat,‘

setting off another sustained
ovation. Before the game ended,
with Grinnell ahead 82-67. 13
Grinnellians had logged playing
tlmc.

Five Pioneers ended in double
figures, led by Haigh’s gamchigh
22, Bailey followed with 18, Bruce
Johnson pitched in 12, Scott Lewis
tabbed fl, and Williams tallied 10,
Mike Giudici led The Carls with 16.
. Scnioi- guard Johnson, the only
man‘nn the squad withifour full

years of Grinnell basketball under
his belt, missed most of the second
half after Carleton's Bruce
Feathers rammed into him near
midcourt, knocking him to the
floor. Johnson sustained a knee
Complication which inhibited his
style at the all campus Cowles
party that night, but which seems
now not to have been serious.
Johnson was playing one of his best
games ever for Grinnell, with 12
points already in the books. The
playrmaking guard finished sixth
in Grinnell scoring this year,
trailing Bailey, iiaigh, Thors,
Williams, and Lewis.

Scott Lewis, a 6-4 freshman
forward, came up with the only all
time Grinnell season record this
year, setting a new field goal
percentage mark. Lewis shot 46 ior
BS from the field, for a percentage
of 55.4. That erased the previous
Grinnell record oirJohn Sundell,
who shot for 51.8 per centin 1963764.

Grinnell’s sports situation is
blossoming on many frontssin the
win column, in the varied and
equal nature of the athletic ofr
ferings, in fan interest and ac-
ceptance, in campus
coverageiand seasons like the one
just completed by the Pioneer
basketballers will undoubtedly
continue‘those trends.
