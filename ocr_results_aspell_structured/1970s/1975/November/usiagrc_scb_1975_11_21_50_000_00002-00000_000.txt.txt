Last week the Grinnell Computer
Services center made some
deimite changes to increase ei-
iiciency, and Wednesday came up
with some other definite
possibilities ior improving services
to various areas oi the college.

As of Wednesday, Nov. 14, the
computer has been reserved
between 7 am. and 11 am. for
administration use
Separating administration time
from academic and other usage
time will shorten response time for
all parties.

in addition, academic usage
time has been extended two hours,
until 2 am. Monday through

Honors,

advising

discussed

A booklet about academic ads
vising and a proposed change in
the honors system are the major
topics that the Curriculum Council
has discussed this semester.

Mara Porper, Chairperson of the
council,'explained that a booklet to
aid advisers has been published
before, but that a more com-
prehensive one is needed, She said
it will include ideas of what role an
adviser should play and also
general iniormation about various
departments. This iniormation
would help advisers council
someone who wants information
about which they were not
lamiliar,

No speciiic change in the honors
system have been considered this
year. However, according to Jim
Freeman. Porper explained that
the present honors system has only
minimal requirements and allows
for a large amount of discretion
within each department. Presently
the only comprehensive
requirements are a cumulative
G.P.A. of 3,2 and GPA. in the
major at 3.4. Porper explained that
there is no continuity and that an
effort is being made to fashion
somc sort of honors requirements
instead of the present minimal
ones.

The Curriculum Council is made
up of one representative from each
EPC ”Educational Planning
Committee). Meetings are held
whenever Porper calls them. The
Council acts in an advisory
capacity and Porper is interested
in getting as much student input as
possible. Though the council ltself
has no real powcr, iour oi its
members vote on the Curriculum
Committee. Poi-per, Mark Miller,
from Humanities: Phyllis Ladd,
from Social Sciences; and
Freeman, from the Natural
Science are the council’s
representatives.

The Scarlet and Black, November 21, 1975—pir2

Computer center economizes

Thursday. Students may stay
later, it was decided Wednesday,
as long as a Usage Consultant is
present,

According to Computer Services
Director Mark Grundler, another
streaml‘ ’ng move may be to soon
install coin operated terminals in
the Forum for students to play
games such as Star-Trek, Grundler
said this would free terminals in
the center ior more important
functions. while helping to pay ior
non-academic usage. Grundler
said installing the cathode ray tube
(CRT) terminals instead oi typing
terminals in the Forum was a
“definite possibility.”

The center itself will also be
using more CRT’S in the future
since they cost several hundred;
dollars less than printing terminals 3
and do not use paper.

To increase eiiiciency and
diminish waste, the center also
recycles or sells its used paper,
and uses the revenue to buy more
paper.

Grundler said that rapidly in-
creasing demands are being
placed on the computer. He sees
the necessity oi purchasing a piece I
of equipment costing $20,000
dollars in the very near future but
funds will not be available for at
least one year, he said. _‘
