i‘» Over the years, the women’s movement has meant different things to
different people, At tirst many had the idea that a true feminist was a
manrhating single, careerorientedwoman, l-lowever, ideas like this have
given way to a feminist philosophy which encourages each person to ‘do
their own thing,’ regardless ofsex or any preconceived notions oi society,

3' Women, hampered for so long by the expectations of others, are gaining
a new awareness oi their own capabilities, Yet, in many ways society is
not yet ready to allow them to pursue their goals, To implement change,
women are working individually as well as collectively in many groups
and organizations throughout the world, At Grinnell some women
Jtruggle for liberation within the sphere of their own lives and some have
formed a Women’s Group and are working collectively. But whether or
not women concern themselves with the Women’s Movement they are
bound to run across it in conversation at some time during their lives at
Grinnell.

in putting together a spread about women at Grinnell the door was wide
open because Grinnell women are involved in all aspects of campus life
and many oi the Women's Movement.

Though the articles presented here do not come anywhere close to
covering the totality oi women’s lives at Grinnell, and may not even be a

representative sampling, they do speak ior at least some of the women at

‘Grlnnell. .

Afﬁrmative action orders
non-discrimination in hiring ’

by Rosa Miehnya

Federal Executive Order 11375,
effective October of 1568, requires
any college receiving more than
$100,000 in federal funds to file with
the government a Written plan for
affirmative action. According to
Mary Eysenbach, Dean oi the
Curriculum and AffirmativeAction
Officer, Grinnell does not receive
that much federal funding.
However, efforts are made to
comply with the basic ideas; after
HEW compiled a set of coma
prehensive guidelines, Eysenbach
prepared an “internal working
summary" in the fall of 1974,

In short, the college must
practice non-discrimination ton
grounds of race, religion, sex, or
national origin) in its hiring, while
making certain that women and
minorities have not been “un»
derutilized.” If the percentage of
women and minority members
hired does not reflect the number
in the candidate pool, the college
should practice affirmative action
in seeking qualified applicants.

in her summary, Eysenbach
explains the concept of affirmative
action. “It requires additional ef-
fort to recruit members of groups
formerly excluded, whether ex
cluded deliberately or mad
vertently. The premise . . , is that
unless positive action is un-
dertaken to overcome the effects of
,. , exclusion and dlscriminatinn, a
benign neutrality in employment
practices will tend to perpetuate
the status qut) ante indefinitely."
Such efforts chieﬂy involve ex-
tensive advertising so that
qualified candidates will be aware
of any positions available.
Eysenbach noted that the
number of Women in the candidate
pool is increasing, with more
women completing PhD.
requirements. Once applications
are received, one can follow up on
those submitted by under
represented groups, At the same
time, however, it is not legal to
ignore the applications oi qualified
white males. According to
Eysenbach, one must exercise

great caution to insure that equal
opportunity laws are not
overlooked in the quest for at-
firmative action, In the end, she
stressed, one must choose the
candidate who seems the most
capable.

While an increase in the number
of faculty women would be
“educationally desirable,”
Eysenbach expressed her belief
that women instructors as role
models constitute only a subtle
influence on women students.
Although“this influence is not
entirely unimportant,” she stated
that at the college level, such
models become less important to
women who “have become more
conscious of the ways in which they
have been encouraged to aspire to
motherhood and housewifery.”
Since the l95fl‘s, feminist
movements have become more
visible and feminists, more vocal;
Eysenhach feels that this change
has been a greater inﬂuence on
women students than role models.

Emphasize Sim/iariz‘ies

People have asked me about the
Women’s Group at Grinnell and
what it is. I can’t really answer
that because those of us who are
directly involved aren’t really
sure. At this point the Group is
emerging from several weeks of
meetings and organizing and
trying to define ourselves. We
have, in essence, been mapping out
the structure for the Group, which
will hopefully last until someone
wants to change the structure and
has the dedication to do it.

The past weeks have not been
easy for those in the Steering
Committee. At times I have
wanted to leave because the
frustration of Working with eight or
nine other people and seeing little
progress was getting too great. I
was told countless times to trust
my sisters and support them. This
was not easy, because i knew i
could not be trusted, so why should
I trust others“! I don’t know what
kept me in, but I'm glad I stayed
because we reached a turning
point, and now we know where
we're going.

We have structure and a start
towards my conception of a
definition. But most importantly,
the behind the back cutting down
has gone. Something changed, and
now the women in the Committee
have learned to deal honestly with
each ouier, and perhaps learned
how to Compromise a little for the
sake of something larger. We’ve
learned how to be in a group, and
how to function.

Can this be applied to a larger
body of women, perhaps all the
Grfnncll women? i believe it can.
We are a group of women with
diverse interests and ideas. This is
good. But perhaps we are
polarized, which is not good.

The Women’s Group is a small
unit serving only a small fraction
of the college women. There are a
variety of reasons for this. First of
all, the Group will work to serve
those who come and present ideas.
We can’t be asked to have a
presentation or a goal it it’s never
occurred to us. We work on what
we need. We reach some people,
but not nearly enough.

This brings me to the more
important problem of polarization.
I believe that the very name
“Women’s Group” connotes a
group of radical women who hate
men and burn their bras. I am
REALLY tired of that crap. It isn’t
funny anymore; it never was
iunny. The Group is made up at a
variety of women, with varying
degrees of ”radicalism" and
feminism. I don‘t think any of us,
at least not those on the Steeering
Committee, hate men, and to my
knowledge no one has burned her
bra. So why the old myths?
Perhaps because no one will get
u u t a n d take a chance.

Maybe you will meet someone
with different ideas. I hope you
both survive. College is supposed
to be a time of growth and ex-
perience but one doesn't grow by
constantly meeting and seeing the
same people, Closing one’s ears to

the few different ideas that trickle
in during classes. No one wants a
change, we just want an open ear
and an open mind. This is not to say
that we are not guilty of the same
things. I know I have pro-supposed
ideas, but I’m trying to learn to put
them away.

Grinnell College is, supposedly,
a liberal and tolerant school. I
wonder many times if we aren’t
just patting ourselves on the back
for no reason, The “tolerence” I
see means not punching someone
out for a different idea of lifestyle,
and more often it is closing oneself
off from those different from us.
We tolerate, but are we tolerant? I
see a difference.

In the next few weeks, hopeiully,
the Women’s Group will present a
series of programs and open
houses for the campus. I hope that
maybe, Just maybe, people will be
willing to ignore their prejudices
and come to a program that in-
terests them. You don‘t have to
join a committee, or agree with our
politics. But we are all women and
we do have Common needs, like
health care. At a film on Women’s
Health Care I should see seven or
eight hundred women. I might see
fifty,

What i am trying to say is that
it’s time to look at our similarities,
instead of our differences, Take a
chance; go to the program come to
the center. You might meet a new
idea or you might have a good
time. And I promise you won’t be
handed a match.
