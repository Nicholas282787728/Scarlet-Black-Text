by Dave Schechter
Grinnell and Knox are the teams
that will fightit out this weekend in
the PEG pool, as they vie for the
Midwest Conference swim title

.‘ along with eight other‘teams. Four

defending champions return from
last year's meet and many Grin-
nell pool records should be broken.

while the Pioneers and Siwash
are expected to- have the best
chances for succeeding St. Olaf
(who has since left the conference)
as champion, Cornell, Ripon, and
Carleton will attempt to play the
spoiler’s role.

Bob winters is returning to
titles in the IUD
backstroke, zoo backstroke, and
zoo individual medley, which he
has won for the past two years,
Steve Varick of Knox is the
defending champ in the too, 200.
and soo yard freestyle races. Mike
Muro of Knox defends his too and
zoo butterﬂy titles, and John Koch
of Cornell is the defending
champion in the so free.

This year’s meet features three
new events. The tooo free has been

9 dropped in favor of the issofree. an

event swum at the NCAA cham-
pionships. Also new are the Boo free
relay and the 400 individual
medley.
Who's gonna win?

Favorites are hard to pick as
coaches like to keep their line-ups a
guarded Secret until the latest
moment possible, in this case last

night’s entry meeting. Still, here
are the people to watch in the
various events:

Distance freestyle~Varick of
Knox is the easy choice to win
whatever freestyle races he enters.
Still, Lars Peterssen oi Carleton,
Bill Ebinger of Cornell, Jeff Nelson
of Ripon and Mark Wright could
pose a threat to Varick.

Spring freestyieexock and
Ebinger of Cornell are the
favorites in the sprints, Others to
watch include Pat Swanson of
Knox, Phil Benezra of Carleton,
and Al Btesh of Grinnell.

DivinngeWayne Sturtz of Cote
is the favorite followed by Tom
Cmelija of Ripon, Joe Wamhach oi
Grinnell, and Tom Cutter of
Lawrence.

Butterfly7Muro stands above
the other swimmers. but John
Chambers of Grinnell is among
those hoping to narrow the
Siwasher‘s chances of victory.

Backstrokwlf Winters lost it
would be an upset, but that doesn’t
mean that the competiton is easy,

Steve Tomlin of Ripoff and Benezra
will press Winters,

Maimen off to conf. meet

by Rick Nightingale
The Pioneer matmen concluded

cheir dual meet season last

weekend, losing to Knox 28718, and
to Carleton 27-17. Against Knox,
Scott Beers i134) pinned his ops
ponent. Hosea Engram (177) and
Rick Nightinglae (118) won by
forfeit. Against Carleton,
Nightingale won with a pin
, (Carleton’s woman wrestler did
not make the trip), Beers won by
forfeit, Dan Mosby won by a 1273
decision at 167 lbs.. and Engram
restled to a 5-5 draw.

The losses left Grinnell with a
record of 2a, and were disaps
pointing since the Pioneers could
have won both meets if Bob
Donelan and Bo deRosa had not
been injured, both wrestlers are
out for the season and will not be
available for the Conference
Tournament

Grinnell concludes its season
with the 34th Midwest Conference

tournament at Mons
mouth today and tomorrow
Grinnell’s lineup will most likely to
Nightingale at 118, Beers at 125,

John Douglierty at 134, Mark
Genereux at 150, Mosby at 150,
Engram at 167, and Mike Darragh
at 177.

Day} of rest

by Dave Calvert

So where’s the story on the
women’s swim team, the team
that’s undefeated in six dual mees
and which was supposed to wrap
up its season Tuesday at Knox?

i thought you might ask that.
Here’s what happened, briefly.

[t snowed like crazy all day
Monday, depositing a half a dozen
inches here in Grinnell and more
than that in the eastern part of the
state, Worried about the prospects
of an accident, and with head
Coach Mike Daley out of town due
to a death in the family, team cos
captains Jill Hoover and Gail
Machala called Knox Tuesday
morning and had the meet Can-
celled The womcn are through
until next year, but it sure was a
sweet season ,

 

Koch, Zimmerman, and possibly
Pat Mitchell of Knox. In the 4001M
entries are unsure as we go to
print, but if they swim it, Cham-
bers, Mitchell, Tomlin, and Carl
Gunderssen of Carleton have the
best shots at winning it.

Mitchell and Tom , Rowat of
Grinnell are the “garbagemen” of
their respective teams. So as we go
to print it is hard to predict their
races though they could square off
in the butterfly.

Relays—Grinnell and Knox have
the fastest medley and BOD-yard
tree relays, while Cornell and
Carleton join these two at the top of
the 400 free relay listings.

Now to pick a winner—l can't.
The meet is expectd to go to the
final events, possibly down to the
400 free relay. Fins, no matter how
many firsts Grinnell and Knox can
rack up, a combination oi two
things will decide the outcome.
First, how each school’s number
two swimmers place; and second,
how much of a spoiler threat
Cornell, Carleton, and Ripon pose.

Intramural basketball has at
long last come to a close with the
crowning of ClarksGates as Men’s
League champion. You millions of
readers will recall that last week
CowlessRawson emerged from the
Coed League ranks to sit atop the
Latimer Cup, long symbolic of true
championship. ClarksGates fended
off a stiff challenge from Younkers
5244 in their championship game
Wednesday night. First, however,
let us take a look at how C-G and
Younkers made it to the cham-
pionship game.

In the quarterfinal round of the
playoffs, the Profs skipped by
Norris 7560. Not meaning to offend
intentionally, it was obvious from
the rather Slim margin of victory
that the Profs were struggling.
What was obvious in the quarter-
finals was to become reality in the
semis, however. mo Johns led all
scorers, Hershey with 2o for the
victors and Lom with 21 points for
Norris.

Younkers received a forfeit from
Langan which was probably as
close as the Langan team could
come to winning anyway, despite
the play of dazzling .lon R.

MainrMears stifled competitive
but defective Smith 5229 as three
Main-Mears bucketballers scored
13 points apiece. Mike Harris led
good 01' Smith. also scoring 13
points (isn’t this amazingl). And
when the scores of the other three
players that scored for MsM are
totaled, they also equal 13 points. if
only Jeanne Dixon were here to tell
us what all the unlucky thirteens

one of the Midwest Conferences premier buiterflyers.
Chambers, churns through the water in his favorite cvent. Chambers
will be one of Grinnell’s hopefuls in the confcrcnce swim meet, which
is going on atthe pcc today mid totiitit'row.

Clark-Gales is number one

mean!

In the final game of the quarter-
finals, Clark-Gates blitzed,
blasted, and bombed on Campus
7625. With the score 4043 at
halftime in favor of CG, the out-
come was never in doubt. Paul
Delaney put in a blistering pera
iormance, scoring 23 big ones.

The semifinal games were
leagues apart as far as quality of
play was concerned, Clark-Gates

enjoyed a laugher over Main-
Mears by the score of ooao.
However, at one point CG led MM
31-1 which is about as lopsided as a
score can get. Rick Drimalla
scored 20 points for the winners,
And in the upset of die year
Younkers squeaked by the Profs by
2 points, 6563.

The Profs led by a comfotable (in
point margin with less than two
minutes to go but the hustling
Younkerites came storming back
to score four unanswered baskets
and secure a berth in cham~
pionship city. The dynamic duo of
Mike Hopkins and Dave Van
derle scored 24 and so points
respectively for Younkers, while
the Profs were paced by Ron
Mitchell, Hershey, and Mo Hunt.

Diamondmen to make

by Rich Arnold

Rather man spend midsemester
break in the cold and snow of the
northern United States, Grinnell’s
baseball team will be spending one
week of that break in warm and
sunny Texas, The lone star state
has beckoned and the Pioneer
diamondmen have been attracted!
While Texas is famous for its
unpredictable weather, Coach
John PfiLsch and the squad all hope
for decent Conditions in order for
the trip to be both productive and
financially justified.

interest in baseball is par-
ticularly keen this season; Texas
beats Frostbite Falls any day!
Budget limitations and tran-
sportation difficulties necessitate
that no more than fifteen players
be allowed to make the trip. Coach
Pfitsch has set two main guidelines
for who goes and who does not.
They are‘ 1) Two weeks of indoor
practice to be held prior to the
break which should give an ins
dication of who the top fifteen
players arc, and 2) anyone who
wants to go along must run.z| mile

in under six minutes. Pfitsch is
hopeful that these two Criteria will
weed out those who do not really
want to dedicate themselves to
working their hardest for a wine
ning baseball season, and leave
those who do.

The trip itself will be partially
subsidized by the baseball budget,
and partially by student funds.
Expected costs to each player
should run around $40. The team
will get the first week of mid-
semester break to themselves, and
then regroup at the Grinnell
campus early Sunday morning on
March 24 for the long trip to Fort
Worth. They will spend three
nights in Fort Worth practicing
before leaving for Ranger Junior
College in, of all places, Ranger,
Texas.

The Grinnellians will play three
doubleheadcrs there against the
Ranger JC’s. Baseball, not Cotton,
is King at Ranger, and it just so
happens that last year the number
one Junior college baseball team in
the nation was none,other (than)

The championship game was a
bit of a surprise to this seasoned IM
basketball observer as Younkers
shut down the potent Clark-Gates
offense in the first half, while
Vanderpool was scoring pracr
tically at will, The score at half-
time favored Younkers 2146, In the
second half CG's big guns began to
hit and the whole team outhustled
Younkers. Delaney, Drimalla, and
Al Clark provided the offensive
fireworks while the defense stiﬂed
both Vanderpool and Hopkins. C-G
scored 46 points to Younkei's' 23 in
the second half, two points more in
that half than the men from
Younkers scored all evening.

High point man in the game was
Clark-Gates’ Drimalla with 20
points, followed by Delaney with 15
and Clark with 12. Vanderpool
outdistanced all scorers on the
Younkers squad with 18 points,
Players were emotionally wrought
after the game and tears were
dropping like President Ford's
popularity. One of the victors,
a sentimental senior who knows
who he is, although I shall claim
some sense of journalistic honor
and keep my sources secret, said,
”This is the happiest moment of
my life!” That is what IM
basektball is all about.

Special commendations and
thanks should be bestowed upon
Noble Young, Chris sodoma.
Grant McLaughlin, John Hershey,
Tom Latimer, and a bevy of other
bozos, for without them there
would have been no intramural
basketball and we would not all be
the better for participating in it.
