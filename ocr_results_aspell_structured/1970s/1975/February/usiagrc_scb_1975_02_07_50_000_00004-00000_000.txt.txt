Dorm care for
sheets and “slums

Dorm care means more than the college linen service. The
college has always cared for the day to day up keep of the dorms
by means ofB & G. Just like dirty linen though, the buildings
will only take so much washing and mending before they start
to give way at the seams,

The connection of a healthy mind and a healthy body has
finally been recognized by the college as it appears that
renovation is a serious administrative concern rather than just
a “future” plan advertised to prospectives. The verbal support
of dorm renewal expressed by the administration is a laudable
commitment, especially in the face of financial constraints the
college faces. A written financial commitment would surpass
humanitarianism and soar towards godliness, almost.

The physical plant is to be especially commended for their
agreement to dispense with the red tape maze and rigid
restrictions on student painting. In such a liberal academic
atmosphere, why should we stifle the body, when we try not to
stiﬂe the mind'.7

Since we possess such abundances of intellectualism (as
proved by our board scores), surely we can accept the im-
possibility of actualizing some decorating schemes due to
physical weaknesses and intolerances in the structures fondly
termed dorms.

To the Editor:

The Student Coordinators' 0f-
fice, in association with the Student
Government Association, is
available for use by students
seeking answers to questions or
redress of complaints regarding all
aspects of student life. The coor-
dinators. who act in an omr
budsman capacity on behalf of
students when issues arise, en-
courage you to use the Coor-
dinators’ Office if you are 9X7
periencing diiiiculty in resolving a
problem with the Administration, a
faculty member, or other
groupis).

This year the members of the
Coordinators Office, Ed Hirsch,
Ricky Stokes and myself. have not
only been working on problems
related to the Health Center, the
Institutional Grapevine, SAGA,
and academic Violations, but alsoi
on more complex issues involving
the quality of student life at
Grinnell e student - faculty
relations, living conditions in the
dorms, and the problem of
“academic pressure." We are
working closely with the Deans of
Student Affairs and the Dean of the
College to find solutions to these
problems.

In the next several weeks we will
try to promote some student-
faculty interaction by sponsoring
a series oi student-faculty dinners
and study breaks which we hope
you will attend. We also hope you
will attend your dorm meeting this
Sunday and give your opinion on
what should be done to improve
both the physical and social
aspects of dorm living. Your input

Maybe the fact that there was an

American foreign policy is on the
brink of a new era as the pressures
of energy shortages, natural
resources, severe imbalances in
the flow of capital, and food strain
traditional alliances and new
factors suddenly rise to
prominence. Next week Grinnell
hosts a major conference designed
to deal with the food crisis and
United States foreign policy, a
topic which only recently began to
receive consideration in the Ford
Administration The list of
speakers, panelists, and invited
guests speaks of the complexity of
problem and of the variety of
groups with an interest in the
nature of the final policy. Parr
tlcipating in one way or another
will be economists and politicians,
policy planners and farmers,
reﬂecting the complicated web of
issues: foreign and domestic
agricultural policy, domestic in-
flation, balance of payments,
existing foreign policy com~
mitments, population control, and
environmental destruction.
Perhaps the most significant
aspect of ﬁle food problem is the
lack ofa coordinated and qualified
bureaucracy to develop a single,
integrated American approach to
deal with current starvation and
decreasing perrcapita world food
production.

The present policy planning
procedure involved the Depart
ment of Agriculture, the State
Department-AID, the Treasury
Department. the Office of
Management and Budget, the

Council of Economic Advisors, the
Council on International Economic
Policy, and the stalfof the National
Security Council.

The obvious danger lies in the
formulation of a mum-directional,
possibly contradictory policy.
though the recent (if nominal)
interest Henry Kissinger has
shown can be counted as a plus.
Behind the current flutter of ac-
tivity in Washington looms a
disturbing questi which policy
makers seem unwi ng or unable
to answer: what is or should be the
basis for aiding or not aiding
starving regions? Just as the
tragedy of the Vietnam in~
terveation resulted from a series of
actions which were sometimes the
result of another step into the
quagmire, but more often the
result of not challenging previous
policy assumptions, the United
States Could soon find itself
engaged in a massive food relief
program that has no ﬁrm set of
distribution criteria other than
serving certain special interests.
Essentially the issue of who shall
live and who die must be met.

The current approach to the food
crisis by policy planners ac-
centuates the common tendency to
deal only in derhumanized con-
cepts. The exisiting slucture oi
food aid provides a case in point of
the terms the problem is seen in,
national security, Furthermore.
the practice amounts to de facto
“triage," a decision at whose lives
are valuable and whose are ex

. pendable.

The basis for American food aid
has been and still is PL 430, “Food
for Peace.” which was first passed
in 1954 as means of dealing with the
large American grain surpluses. It
contains two major types of aid,
Title I and Title II. Title I grants
are made for dollars or convertible
currency with long term, long
interest payments. The political
overtones of Title I aid rose in 1972
as reserves fell due to crop failures
around the World. Thus, while the
budget remained constant at just
below a billion dollars, the rising
price of grain meant a decrease
from 6.1 million metric tons of aid
in 1970 to 2.5 in 1973 to an estimated
less than one million in 1974.

The recipients of the limited
amounts of available aid included
the high priority countries of
Vietnam, Cambodia, South Korea,
and Pakistan. AID figures show
that the “security” related
countries of Cambodia, Israel,
Jordan. Laos, Malta, and Vietnam.
Recent reports indicate Ad-
ministration plans to raise the aid
to South Korea form $30 million to
$124 million. Also slated for sub
stantial amounts of aid are Chile,
Indonesia, Israel, Jordan, Syria,
and Egypt. None of these are listed
by the United Nations as requiring
food aid for humanitarian reasons.

The case of Chile is one of par-
ticularly blatant use of food as a
tool of foreign policy. Only three
days before the coup that toppled
the government of Salvador
Allende, the United States rejected
a cash offer for needed wheat. Just

a month later a credit sale that
amounted to eight time the total
amount commodity credit given
the Chilean government in the
Allende years was approved,

Congress acted, at the prodding
of Iowa Senator Dick Clark. to
restrict the amount of PLABU aid
that Could be used for political
purposes. Secretary of state
Kissinger has been attempting to
change the classification of
Vietnam from “political" to
“humanitarian" in what promises
to be the first of many attempts to
avoid compliance.

Title II aid is given directly to
volunteer agencies, other govern
ments, and United Nations
agencies. Since 1954 $5.6 billion has
been donated, reaching a peak in
1972 when 62 million people were
fed through regular programs and
an additional 27 million through
emergency relief. Those figures
have dropped dramatically in the
past two years. In 1973 $290 million
fed 63.5 million people 45 billion
tons of food; in 1974 $267 million fed
45.6 people 2.9 billions tons of land.
Title II aid has not been subjectsto
the same sort of political use that
Title I has, but the future prospects
ior the program are dim. There is
some doubt that any money Will be
available this yard

Thus one set of criteria has been
in use of determining which people
eat. However, as the bureaucracy
moves to meet the food crisis. we
must decide if aiding the hungry is
the right thing, and if so to whom
on what basis.
