Ullrich, Grinnellian
now and then

.-

What is a scholar athlete? Tom
Latimer, college director of
recreational Iacilities, has a
special definition. “What is the
epitome or a scholar athlete?
That's easy, Dick Ullrich,"

And who is Dick Ullrich’! A
Grinnell alumnus with a
remarkable life story.

Ullrich was born in Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, September 14, 1910.
Seven years later his family moved
to Des Moines. Living there until
1928, he participated in several
high school varsity sports. He
learned to love handball, which he
calls, “the king of the fourrwall
court games."

In 1928 he migrated northeast to
Detroit, Mi.—sans lamily. There

he helped build cars for Essexv

Automobiles, a job he didn’t enjoy.
However, he also joined the Detroit
YMCA basketball team which
previously had won the world
YMCA championship and sub
sequently went on a winning tour of
Canada, At this point he had to
choose a college.
Decides on Grinnell

He picked Grinnell College. in
part, he came to Grinnell because
“I loved sports and it was a smallr
college athletic powerhouse.”
Other reasons included his close
friend then (and to this day) Harris
Cuggeshall ‘29, and the prestigious
academic reputation Grinnell
possessed. Incidentally,
Coggeshall, asuperb tennis player,
and Ullrich teamed up to win the
state of Iowa handball doubles
championship eleven times.

During his four years at Grin-
nell, he quarterbacked thc lootball
team, played on the basketball
squad (selected All-Missouri
Valley in both sports). He lived all
four years on Dibble third in a
triple and claims “it was the life."
(He also worked Saga and was a
straight B student).

Drartcd By nears

Drafted by the National Football
League’s Chicago Bears, Ullrich
tried out following his 1933
graduation. He stayed with the
Bears for six weeks but failed to
survive the ﬁnal cut to eighteen
players. He played for a season
with the Tulsa Oilers of the old
American Football League and
then married Lois Hadley of Des
Moines. From 1934-39. he
simultaneously worked for
General Motors and played for the
Des Moines Comets football team.
He left both jobs in 1939 to enter the
Frye Manufacturing rirm. only to
enlist in '41 in the Navy. stationed
in the Atlantic, he advanced to
lieutenant commander before the
war ended in '45.

Upon returning, Ulirich cone
tinued his dual life, He worked for
various rubber and plastics
manuiactnrers, and referred
many high school and college
basketball and football contests. In
1961 he joined the first reiereeing
crew in the newly formed
American Football League. Some
of the teams were the New York
Titans (now Jets). the Dallas
Texans (now Kansas City Chiefs)

and the Los Angeles Chargers

as good shape as he is when l’m his
age." ullrich will be celebrating
his sixtyrl'itth birthday in Sep

When asked what Grinnell meant
to him, Ullrich explained, “After
your family, comes your college . .

continued. “A large majority of the
close friends I retain to this day are
Grinnell graduates.” As to the
