“Moving up, moving out”

Dean of Student Affairs

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to the Student
who wrote to the editor last week
(“moving out, moving up”) concerning
the new office that will house academic
advising,'carccr services, and student
affairs next year. I believe that your
concern is justifiable and i would like to
attempt to answer specifically two oi
your questions:

1) Who pays for these decisions?

2) Who has input into them?

i have been trying for the past three

years to get the three oiiices mentioned '

above into one building. My motivation
has not been to get a better office (in»
deed, the new one will have more space,
but will not be as nice as the one we are
leaving), but to improve services to
students, if a student has emotional
problems. they usually also have
academic problems, and if they have
academic problems they often have
career problems. The counseling,
academic and career services offices
are presently spread out over the entire
campus. This makes it very difficult to
coordinate these services, even when
all three oilices are trying to help the
same student. It is hoped that with the
offices together, there will be better
communication and cooperation
amongst them, that a student will have
one place where he-she can go with any
problem (and not have to run around
the entire campus), that we will be able
to offer co-counseling to the student
having both personal and academic
problems. and that we will be able to
more effectively use the Resident
Advisers that work in all three offices,
It is also advantageous to be close to
Nollen House so the Dean of Off-
Campus Study and the Dean oi the
Curriculum can be brought in when a
student’s problem involves those areas,

Your letter to the editor stated that
the creation of this new office was
“inadvertently reveled" for the first
time two weeks ago in the S 5t 8. This is
not the case. The creation of this office
was publicized in the Maerune, 1974
and July-August, 1974 issues oi the
Gl'inncil Magazine. The concept of such
an office was presented, by me, to the
Counseling Committee, which consists
of four students, Dean of Student Afr
fairs, Director of Academic Advising,
College Chaplain, one Resident Adviser
and one iaculty member. The Coun»
seling Committee approved the con-
ceptn and recommended to the
President that such an office be
created. Both last year’s and this year’s
SGA Cabinet were aware of the project
and have talked with me about it.
Contrary to your letter. there has been
student input mto the decision.

Your other primary concern was
“who pavs for these decision?" As was
mentioned in the Grinnell Magazine,
the class of 1925 is iinancing this project
in memory oi one oi their classmates,
Robert Fell. The money for the house is
not coming out oi current funds nor the
endowment.

The vacancy of our present offices
Will benefit the students in at least one
other way. The unoccupied space
created by the relocation of the Student
Affairs and Academic Advising offices
will make available needed space for
student groups in the Forum.

l hope i have answered some of the
questions you have about the office, and
perhaps overcome some of your ob»
jections to it, If not, I am more than
willing to talk personally to you, or to
any other interested persons, about it.

Vice President for Institutional Development

To the Editor:

1 am not one to normally submit a
response to a ”letter to the editor,” but I
do want to set the record straight as
regards some of the statements made in
last week’s issue concerning certain
College expenditures and signed by
fourteen Grinnell students.

(1) It is true that the student deans’
offices and other offices dealing with
student services are to be housed
together in the future, This has been long
overdue and will bring together in one
place many of the services which com-
plement one another but are new scat-
tered about the campus. The “new
building" referred to is the College—
owned house immediately south of Nollen
House (where President Turner rem.
porarily lives). The renovations.
however, will be paid ior not through
student lees but by the Class of 1925 as a
50th Anniversary fundrraising project in
honor at and memory of a classmate,
Robert Fell.

(2) The “Coronation” of President
Turner will not be a lavish affair, but
compared to the usual activities
surrounding an inaugural, quite modest.

(3) The “Food, Famine, and Foreign
Policy” conference was slightly eXr
panded version of “The Rosenfield
Lectures,” paid ior through an en-
dowment established ior this purpose
some years ago.

(4) The conference on “The American
West” likewise was not paid for by way oi
student lees, The project was iunded
through private ioundation monies
granted expressly for this purpose._

£5) The off-hand reference to both
conicrences as “two expenswe public
relations coups” is at least naive-and at
best misleading. If our public relations
was improved through media coverage.
fine. But more important. both events
were conceived as affairs which would be
of intellectual interest to both the
academic and the wider community. We
need and require good public relations
with our publics, And we need continuing

programs of a high order which will
bring to the campus speakers and lec-
turers on subjects of special interest.
Neither is mutually exclusive. But the
Central focus for all such affairs is the
student.

(6) Last. week's authors said that
“student and iaeulty are now having to
pay the costs of self-seeking ads
ministrative decisions," reiarring,
presumably, to the above concerns,
Perhaps i, too, am naive, hut insofar as l
have had anything to do with these
decisions or their financial implications,
Ihave neither seen nor heard anything in
this regard to justiiy such a cynical
statement. On the contrary, these sorts of
decision are made precisely with
students in mind. . to provide better and
more eiiicient services and, hopeiully. to
keep the place intellectually Viable. We
may not always be right, but we do lry.l
should like to know who the “self
seekers” are.

(7) Neither the tearing down of the old
Colonial Theatre nor the Women’s
gymnasium “cost" the College taculty
members—that is, had (nor have) any
bearing on reduction oi iaculty size. Had
the gymnasium been used for a specific
purpose (and many were proposed). the
whole structure would have had to be
torn down to a shell (if, indeed, that was
possible at all) and rebuilt at a fantastic
cost. The building was a potential death
trap, and despite the modest numbers
within the community who lobbied for
retaining the iacility because oi its
“unique architecture" or for other
reasons, the administrative decision
was, I think, sound. As to the Colonial
Theatre, the property will in due time be
sold and the College should suffer no
financial loss. indeed, we hope to come
out ahead oi the game.

i am not trying to portray the ad-
ministration as a bunch of omniscient do-
godders. We have our own hangups and
prejudices, But on the issues raised by
this particular group oi students, I ielt
that a response was in order.

ISPIRG alert: Stop nuclear now

Open Space

We must ask the questions, “Will
our economy become unglued it we
do not continue to double our
energy consumption each
decade?”
needed as an cnorgy source?" “Is
it safe"” and “ls it economical?”
The Ford Foundation and Rand
Corporation reports suggest that
energy conservation can give us
latitude to choose between energy
systems, Using less cncrgy does
not necessarily mean a lower
standard of living. Sweden, for
example. has the same per capita
income as the U.S,, while cons
suming halt the amount of energy.
With 6 per cent of the world's
population. the U s. consumes do
per cent oi the world's energy. At
this rate our oil and natural gas
reserves will be totally depleted
shortly after the year 2000,

Utilities are
desperately pushing nuclear
energy in an attempt to meet rising
consumer demand and recoup
their investment in uranium.

Critics have suggested that
utilities oppose solar energy
development because they can not
monopolistically control the sun.
Japan presently heats and cools
400,000 homes with solar energy.
This alternate energy source has
great potential, but only in terms oi
the demands placed on it by the
economy and by society.

initially the problems associated
with nuclear power seemed simple
enough thermal pollution and
radioactive emission during
normal operation, A closer
examination oi nuclear power
uncovered safety issues of more
farrreaching significance.

A 1965 Study, released this year

» by the Public information Act, was

“ls nuclear fission'

currently .

abandoned after 1000 pages oi the
report were completed. Dr.
Schcsenger, a scientist who
worked on the study, explained
why the study was aborted.

This 1965 study was to have
updated a study completed in 1957,
wherein the results of the worst
possible nuclear reactor accident
were calculated, in the ’57 report,
3.400 people would have been
killed, 45,000 injured and $7 billion
in property damaged Nuclear
power plants in 1965 were five
times larger than the plants oi '57.
The indications of Dr.
Schesenger‘s report were that the
nuclear industry would be liable
for $22.4 billion in damages in the
case oi a cataclysmic accident.
This was up irom the ’57
calculation of $500 million. Utilities
can presently aliord to ignore
these iigures, as the Price
Anderson Act limits their liability.

Additional , safety questions
concerning the Emergency Core
Cooling System (ECCS) and
radioactive waste disposal have
still to be resolved. The ECCS is
designed to Cool the reactor in case
of a major accident. in computer
models and actualconditions, the
ECCS has consistantly failed.

A recent example of mechanical
problems are “flaws” discovered
in the “fcedwater sparger" system
of the Number Two unit of the
Quad-Cities Nuclear Station at
Cordova, Illinois. This system
sprays water into the core oi the
reactor. The reactor will be shut
down until at least mid~April as a
result or the iindlng.

The three plants that serve
Iowa, Cordova, Palo and
Brownsville supply about 45 per
cent of lowii's electrical needs

when operating at peak eiiieiency,

Maurice Van Nostrand, chair~
man of both the Iowa Commerce
Commission and the Energy Policy
Concil (EPC) will have recom-
mendations on the nuclear
question ready for the legislature
within a month,

A bill calling for a 5 year
moratorium in lowa was recently
introduced by Rep. Gregory
Cusak. Cusak realizes that “the big
problem is the disposal ot nuclear
wastes, We really haven’t iigured
out what to do with them.”

Plutonium is the most toxic
substance known to mankind, It
does not occur naturally, but only
as a by-product oi the iission
process. One speck oi plutonium is
suiiicient to casue terminal lung
cancer it inhaled by a human.
Plutonium is also the raw material
used to construct atomic bombs.
The AEC. now the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, presently
can not account for a lull one per
cent oi the plutonium in their
stockpiles. No one knows it this
material has been lost or stolen,
Neither possibility is appealing.
Terrorists with a moderate
knowledge of physics could con
struct a crude bomb with
plutonium, or simply release it in a
water supply, We must not con-
tinue to license these plants while
hoping that a technological
solution to these problems will
occur.

Nuclear power plants are not
reliable, When iirst built, the
plants were calculated to run at 80
pcr cent of full capacity and time.
The current national average for
these plants, however, is 54 per
cent efficiency Plants ol

r than

seven years operate at only 30 per
cent capacity.

Utilities plan to compensate ior
these ineilicient losses by building
larger and equally inefficient
reactors, with their attendant
safety hazards

The capital being placed in the
nuclear market produces a
significant drain of monies that
could be used to develop alternate
energy sources, promote mass
transit, etc. ,

ISPIRG urges Congress to phase
out nuclear power, Legislation is
needed which aims at achieveing a
zero energy growth (but not a zero
economic growth), Practical
measures include requiring ef-
ficient insulation for new con-
struction and promoting railroad
freight service.

A bill. imposing a nationwide
moratorium on the construction
and operation of nuclear power
plants, will soon be introduced to
the US. House of Representatives
by Representative Fish. Mike
Blouin and Tom Harkin of Iowa
both support the bill. Strong op-
position by the utilities is expected,
Public support of the moratorium
is critical NOW. Please write your
Representative and Senator im-
mediately. Urge them to reallocate
money to alternate energy sources,
especially solar, impose strict
energy conservation measures,
and STOP NUCLEAR NOW! Send
your letters air mail to us. House
of Representatives and U.S.
Senate, Washington, D.C. 20515.

Mezvinsky is located on page it.
