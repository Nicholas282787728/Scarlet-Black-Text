Humanism redefined

by Doug scliiiltz

while redefining or rcclarifying
an terms such as humanism and
religion and incorporating new
ones such as functional ultimacy
tl relative atheism, Dr, William

. Jones presented his case for
“Secular Humanism as Religion,”
the title ofthis year's Gates lecture
series, held Sunday and Monday
evening this week in Roberts

"Theatre.

In his first lecture Sunday flight
entitled, “The Case for
Humanism: Problems and
Prospects" Dr. Jones, Associate
Professor of the Philosophy of
Religion at Yale Divinity School,
discussed _why he believes
humanism is a viable equal

mternative religion to Western
theism. In so doing, he gave his
definitions of humanism and
religion, arguing that calling
oneself a religious humanist which

' does, is not like calling oneself a

married bachelor as some might

protest
one of the leasons Jones ex-

lalned why humanism has not
been accepted as a valid religion
stems from the misconception that
religion is the same as theism
‘Rcligion, Jones said, has as its
purpose salvation for Mankind, the
defining of man’s ultimate reality,

While theism has tied man's
salvation or ultimate reality to
God, humanism offers the belief in
human freedom, that man controls
his own destiny, as its guiding
principle.

Jones emphasized that
humanism is not equivalent to
atheism, “Humanism does not
require the death of God. All it
requires is the affirmation of
human freedom,” he said.

in this context he also argued
that there is no such thing as ab
solute atheism anyway, only
“relative atheism,” That is,
because a Christian would deny the
validity of any concept of God but
his own, he would be an atheist
relative to theperson who believed
that “God" is demonic, or a tree or
a rock.

“The humanist does not regard
the Christian God as ultimate
reality, but he does not disregard
ultimate reality,” Jones said.

The concept that man is and
must be free to choose, regardless
of God, Jones termed the “fva
tlonal ultimacy of humanity." It is
functional because it allows man to
make decisions of right or wrong.
We are forced to judge because of
0m uncertainty of whether God or
something else is the ultimate
reality

Harris: slash taxes by
eliminating loopholes

by Dennis Hansen

Restoring democracy in
America emerged as a major issue
in former U.S. Senator Fred
Harrls' (DrOkJ campaign speech
on Monday night in the South
Lounge.

Harris' appearance was the first
in a proposed series oi visits by
presidential contenders sponsored
by the Grinnell College Program in
Practical Political Education.

What makes him different from
other candidates, the former
Senator claimed, is his belief in the
fundamental need for “a fairer
distribution of wealth and power in
America.” He repeatedly stressed
the need for redistributing wealth
and power away from corporations
and wealthy Americans, and back
toward the average American.

Attacking the philosophy of
allowing some level of unemr
ployment to exist permanently,
Harris called for a policy of full
employment.

“No person willing to work ought
to be out of work," said Harris. He
also demanded the termination of
“welfare for corporations" in the
form of government subsidies to
oil, electric, and other cor-
porations, in his opinion, the oil,
automobile, and gasoline in
dustries are under monopolistic
control and should be strictly

In his second lecture, entitled
“Religious Humanism and
Theism, the Coming Debate,”
Jones, a Black man, illustrated the
problem of man's uncertainty and
the need {or man to act as if he
were free, through the problem of
ethnic suffering Using the
question put by Albert L‘amus in
his novel The Plague. “Should a
priest call a doctor?" Jones asked,
“How can l demonstrate (know)
that the punishment (sickness) 1
am enduring is not divine punishr
merit? If] (a priest) call a doctor,
am I abandoning my faith?"

Theism, Jones asserted, leads to
passivity, because it is more
consoling, lt has offered ultimate
justice to suffering ethnic groups
as compensation for injustice, or
divine punishment in this life.

But this divine punishment,
Jones said, presupposes the
ultimate benevolence of God in the
first place. if some theologians
have denied God’s omnipotence to
explain the problem of evil and
ethnic suffering, Jones asked why
we cannot also deny God's omnir
benevolence.

The problem of ethnic suffering
is forcing theism, according to
Jones, to move closer to humanism
by realizing the ”functional
ultimacy of humanity,”

regulated by the government.

On the subject of energy, Harris
proposed increasing energy rates
for industrial users to help ensure
an adequate supply of fuel at a fair
price for private citizens. He also
suggested that energy cor-
porations not lower rates lor inc
creased energy use, but take the
opposite tack.

Proposing an immediate tax cut
of 515 billion, Harris suggested that
such a out should be accompanied
by eradication of tax loopholes for
the very wealthy. He expressed his
concern that the average
American has been greatly
overtaxed in the recent past,
and at the same time rich
Americans have not been paying
their fair share.

Harrisoutlined his program [or a
“foreign policy of new
cooperation." The cornerstone of
this policy is that it must be based
on principle he said,

“It has been ihe policy of our
government that when we get
outside our own national boun-
daries we feel bound by no prinr
ciples. This has decreased our
influence in the world. You could
hardly find a country in the world
(today) where U.S. endorsement
would be welcomed,” observed
Harris.

is missing in our

(current) foreign policy is a
statement of the kind of World we
would like to see.” Harris called
for Americans to decide first what
kind of America they want and
follow the same set of guidelines in
ioreign policy, While he believes
American inﬂuence in the world is
small, Harris said “we needn't
make things worse.”

The second basic element in
American foreign policy must be to
make that policy a public one.
Harris advised. He also sees a need
for reconsideration of America’s
relationships with other
democracies, China, and me Soviet
Union, Another segment of this
public policy must be support for
the people of the world, not just for
the worlds governments.

An internationalization of
problems and the need for the
approval of the American people
for the foreign policy strategy
chosen are the final two elements
of ihe "foreign policy of new
cooperation" proposed by Harris.

Harris said that he has wide
voter appeal and a campaign
organization in torty~threc states.
He supports the policies of the
present U.S. Congress and pledges
to work with it, if elected. to
restore the principles of American
democracy.
