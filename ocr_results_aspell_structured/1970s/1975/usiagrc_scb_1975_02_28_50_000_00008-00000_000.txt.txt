The New Polytheism, by David L.
Miller; liarper ll Row, 1974. iiiipp.
$4. .
by Michnchhessler
Book Editor

The question of belielin God, and
the inherent debate on His-Herrlts
existence, has become of
necessity, a moot point, But for
those still left with the need for
some sort of beliel, or the
recognition oi a higher power, the
omnipresent argument has now
been ingeniously expanded, and
perhaps hopelessly complicated,
by Davis L. Miller's new book,’l‘he
New Polytheism.

Miller here proposes that the
past two millenla have been the
scene of a usurpation of vast
magnitude. The victim has been
the polytheistic world of the an-
cient Greeks. with the culprit being
the Judeo-Christian tradition and
its thorough-going negation of the
possibility of a “polyphonous”
heaven.

Myriad oi deﬁnitions

To support this thesis, Miller

offers a myriad of definitions

Grinnell Scarlet and Black, February 28, 1975*):4'8

And the lords spake

giving credence the notion mat
because all thought, “reality”, and
“self” is not completely one-
sidedithat there is more than one
way to interpret a ieeling or more
than one aspect of that feeling—
that because of this, he ieels the
divine structure of the unlverse is
not a monism but a vast
polymorphism where each idea or
consistent, reaction is symbolized
by the presence of a dillerent god,
and not harbored in the previously
established and heretofore
benignly accepted conception of
one God.

Range ni arguments

His arguments range from the
substantial to the debatable t0 the
juvenile. The substantial aspect of
his thinking is the basis train which
he reckons a need to appreciate a
polytheism, This is wholly derived
from Neitzschc’s death oi God
theology. “By polytheism Neitz-
sche means that lurking in all the
“poly” and plural abstractions at
our scholarship is something very
concrete and real,“ (1'). 3)

Ideas disintegrate

Although Miller disdains the idea
that he is attempting to evolve a
system oi polytheism, it is more
than apparent that he is trylng to
establish a core of ideas out of
which he may develop a theology.
It is in this attempt that the sub
stantial components of his though
border on the absurd. Whereas
most modern religious thinkers
relish the idea of debatability, {or ,
that gives life to their potentially
stagnant ideas. when the subjects
oi debate become too amorphous
and, cease to have internal
coherence (although Miller would
say that this is the Working of the
gods in their Various degrees) the
superstruct e of a set of ideas
begins to di ntegrate,

This begins to occur most im-
mediately in his early definitions,
“Socially, polytheism is a situation
in which there are various values,
patterns olsocial organization, and
principles by which man governs

GRINNELL

his political iite . . ‘
Psychologically, polytheism is a
matter of the radical experience of
equally real, but mutually ex-
clusive aspects oi the self.” (pp. 3-
4)

Greek sources

The argument is further
developed by examples irom
Greek sources and ample
quotations from the corpus of
religious thought over the ages-
with special emphasis on that .
the past mo years. As the book
progresses, his conceptions
become much less concrete and it
appears that he wants to create an
ambiance rather than a firm Set Of
ideas

The fifth chapter is Miller's
attempt to give substance to his
notions and draw ”real-lite”
parallels between the stories oi the
gods and goddesses and mose
situations in our lives that these
stories exemplify. For exampl’,‘
“Urballilation bears the imprint or
Athena. And when it disintegrates
into street riots and muggings it
forgets that Athena, too, had to
make a place tor the turies." (p.
68) All of these stories are “the
deepest structures of reality.” (p.
80)

Polytheismmorality? \

When all is said and done, Miller
otters some interesting ideas that
will probably be tossed around i
a while. But some major question
are lelt unclearly dealt with, the
major one being the place of
morality in a polytheism evolved in
a postrmonistic era.

perhaps, in the long run, Miller
only offers another “way out,” A
contemporary pantheism
sprinkled with literate symbolism.
And one still gets the impression,
whether pantheism or
monotheism, that all these ways of
explaining what some (eel as beirb
beyond human reality,
metaphysical, are still nondivine,
bogus notions, striving to fill a real
or imagined void in the merely
human.
