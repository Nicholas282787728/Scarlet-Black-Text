Diamondmen tanned and prepared

The 1975 Grinnell Pioneer home
baseball season gets under way
this afternoon (weather per-
mitting!) with a doubleheader
against Upper Iowa beginning at 1.
If the hold is dry enough to play
on and the weather holds, the
Pioneers will start their con-
ference season tomorrow with a
twin bill against the Kohawks from
Coe College, also at i. As everyone
knows, but just as a reminder, the
baseball diamond is north of the
outdoor tennis courts, west of the
outdor track, and borders the south
side of the golf course.

This year’s team has a distinct
advantage over past Grinnell
squads because the players were
able to practice in the golden
sunshine or warm Texas over
break. Sixteen players made the
17rhour trip to Texas the latter
week of midsemester break, and
were rewarded with good weather
most of the week. The weather

turned cold last Friday, so the
team packed up and leit ior lowa a
day earlier than planned.

Two full days were Spent in Fort
Worth, where twoaday practices
were held in 7p-degree-plus
weather. The first game of the
season was a scrimmage game
against the Texas Wesleyan
College junior varsity. (The TWC
varsity had swept a doublheader
lrom Notre Dame the previous
day.) The Pioneers dropped this
game to TWC, so, but got solid
pitching iroin Chris Sodoma and
the Grinnell bats met the ball
irequentiy and continousiy, a trend
that was to continue,

Not all the time in Fort Worth
was spent on the field, however, as
many opportunities were provided
tor the men to take advantage oi
and enjoy. Right across the street
from the team’s hotel was a block

were spent basking in the sun by
the edge of the empty swimming
pool. Some team members were
fortunate enough to meet a Fort
Worth policeman, but only to help
melt an Otherwise icy situation,

Having arrived in Fort Worth
late Sunday night, the team packed
up and headed to Ranger, Texas,
home oi Ranger Junior College, on
Wednesday. A game was
scheduled with one of the RJC
baseball teams (they have a great
many boys out for baseball) later
that afternoon, but the Weather
dictated otherwise,

Living quarters were a bit more
spartan at RJC than the hotel in
Fort Worth had been, but one the
team recovered from their initial
shock and terror, the form shaped
up just fine. RJC specializes in
athletics, with academics taking a
distant second, and the stay in
Ranger was, in Coach Pfitsch's
words, a “socializing experience.”
The Ranger players were helpful in
making the Pioneers‘ stay in
Ranger, which appeared, at iirst,
to be a bad dream, an enjoyable
and beneficial one.

Bad weather permitted only two
games to be played against the
Rangers, both Grinnell losses.
Ranger won the ﬁrst game sl
behind solid hitting, fielding, and
pitching. Mike Grejbowski showed
good stuff on the mound tor the
Pioneers in his season‘s debut after
a long layori, and Paul Delaney
blasted a homerun for Grinnell’s
only run.

The second game was a 7.0
Grinnell loss but again good pits
ching was apparent, this time irom
Craig Zippe and Lorne Robinson. It
must be remembered at this point
that RJC is the defending national
junior college baseball champion.

runners and unable to move them
around when men did reach base.

All things considered, the trip
was a success. Two things were
obvious even to the most ignorant
observer: 1) This year's team can
hit and won't be the strikerout
artists of yesteryear, and 2) pits
ching appears to be a plus rather
than a negative as in past years. it
nothing else, the team became a
more cohesive unit because of this
trip, and this alone can only help in
generating the right attitude
