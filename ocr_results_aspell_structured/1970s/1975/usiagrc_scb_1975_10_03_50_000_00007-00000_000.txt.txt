When the Earl Van Sandt family
discovered their well water‘s
nitrate content was 200 parts per
million, 10 times the standard sate
amount. they decided to start
tarming organically. That was in
1964. Now their water is back to a
sate limit. although they are not
presently using that well. Although
the Van Sandl’s work a 175 acre
tamily rarm. they may be more
familiar to Grinnell students as
owners and operaters of Van‘s
Health Food and Antique Store at
1501 6th Ave.

Van Sandt Showed his farm last
Saturday to members ot
Townhouse the college cusop
which is studying local culture.

The Van Sandts switched to
organic farming not only because
of bad water, but also from what
they had read and heard “It
seemed the logical thing to do "

a ”“931:

According to Van Sandt, it seemed
more efficient and On-
vironmcntally sound than tarming
with chemical fertilizers

Van Sandt explained that
organically grown corn has a
deeper, better root system than
chemically lertllizcd corn Such
surface-hound Corn is more
susceptible to wind damage than
organically grown corn. Van Sandt
also explained that the Chemicals
in most fertilizers kill the small
earthworms which help to
replenish the soil.

The Van Sandts do not use many
modern technological methods
which they consider wasteful. For
instance Van Sandt explained that
modern corn haryesting
techniques remove too much at the
stock along with the corn itseli,
rather than lettingitlay in the ﬁeld
to return to humus. Consequently.
the Sail becomes harder to work,
forcing farmers to buy heavier and
more poweriul equipment

Van Sandt also criticized modern
techniques for harvesting and
drying corn Often the corn is
removed from the cob as it is
harvested and electric blowers
(using considerable energy) must
he used to dry the Corn. Van Sandi.
reels that allowing the corn to dry
naturally on the cob is the
preferable method, a drier corn is
obtained and shelling the corn
after it has dried allows the Cubs to
be used as bedding for animals

Van Sandt discussed many
aspects oi iarmtng in general with
the students. and expressed a
desire to see more students out at
his farm. Students interested in
touring the Van Sandt iarm, or any
of a number of other local farms
