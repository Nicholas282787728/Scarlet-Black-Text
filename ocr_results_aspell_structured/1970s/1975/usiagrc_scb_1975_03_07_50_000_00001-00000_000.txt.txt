In order to assess the extent, it
any, oi an alcohol problem on
campus, and to serve as counselor,
Mitch Kelber, a specialist from
Oakdale, will be in residence at
Grinnell for the month of April.
Oakdale is an organization
associated with the University of
Iowa Hospitals in Iowa City.

According to Associate Dean of
Student Affairs Diane Ruyftelaere,
ther have been a number of in-
dications this year that drinking is
a problem Some indications have
been obvious such as property
damage. Most have filtered
through RA’S and students cons
Cerned about other students.

Ruyffelaere said that the college
years, l7 to 22, are the times when
people: patterns, such as drinking
habits start iorming, There is a
critical need, lherciore, Ior ins
formation, education. and couna
seling,

in the four weeks he will be here,
Kelber will serve mostly in a
counseling and educative role.

by Carin De Pres

After the four weeks, he will leave
Ruyffelael-e and the_RA's some
guidelines or plan oi action, it is
hoped.

In an informal meeting, Kelber
concluded that it was going to be
hard to reach students because oi
the “social setup" at Grinnell.
That is, lirst or all, drinking and
Saturday night crashing seem to be
a pastime highly accepted, or at
least tolerated, by both students
and officials. Second, there are
those who drink discreetly, alone in
their rooms.

Kelber thought the most ef-
fectlvc way to accomplish his task
would be to set up informal,
regular meetings to which anyone
interest could drop in. He said
he might also set up a working
reference bibliography for RA's ,
and a shortaterm summer Center
for problem drinkers it necessary.

The main task in any situation oi
this nature, Kelber explained, is to
“help people discover the cons
sequences of their actions,”

Generaerelephone of the Mid
west, owner of phones in Grinnell,
has recently announced a change
in rates and customer refunds due
to excessive earlier charges. Long
distance rates will increase, and a
new onesminute direct dial rate
plan will go into ellcct April 3. The
company is also sending out
refunds for excessive rates it
charged between August 19, 1972
and December 31, 1974,

On February 23, Northwestern
Bell Telephone Company ﬁled a
request with the Iowa Commerce
Commission llCC) to change some
of its rates. The changes have
already been approved by the
Federal Commerce Commission.
Unless the decision is reversed by
the lCC, tlle new plan will take
sheet on April 3, RE, Morgart,
general manager ci General
Telephone explained why his
company is also changing its rates.
In a statement released Weds
nesday he says, “Uniform rates for
these services, regardless of which
company provides them, has been
an established principle ior many
years. It has been and continues to
be the policy of our company to
concur in this concept and to
concur in the rates and tariffs of
the Northwestern Bell Telephone
Company for these services.”

The proposed changes include a
new one-minute direct dial rate
plan. Callers will no longer be
charged for a minimum three
minute period. Calls handled by
operators, including station-tor
station, personattrperson, and
collect, will remain at a three-
minute minimum rate, which will
be increased. Changes will also be
made in wide Area Telephone
Service (WATS) and certain ins
tercity line rates.

General Telephone is now
reimbursing customers tor the last
rate increase it attempted in April
1972, they requested an increase in
telephone service rates irom the
ice The higher rates were placed
in eiiect under bond on August 10,
1972, However, after lengthy
hearings and investigations,
General Telephone was denied any
increase in rates we ruled
against the company because,
under their increased rates,
General Telephone would receive a
la per cent return on equity, as
opposed to the 12 per cent rate oi
return which the commission

regards as fair,

General Telephone is appealing
the legality ol certain portions oi
the ruling in district court. But
refunds of the increase in rates
collected between August Ill, 1972
and December 31, 1974 are being
credited to March and April
customer statements.

Refunds to students who had
telephone lines last year will be
mailed to them at their last for-
warding addresst General
Telephone‘s deadline for refunding
customers is May 1. It a student
has not been located by that time to
receive his refund, the money will
be turned over to the state for use
by the commission.

pound
devalued

personal expenses ior next
year’s GrinnellrlnaLondon
program were outlined Wednesday
nlght, A few veterans of the 1974
session attended the meeting to
discuss iinancial experiences
with the 1975 participants.

Transatlantic travel was the first
expenditure of concern to the
future Londoners. Regular air fare
is estimated by Professors
Caulkins and Jordan to cost $795
round trip lrom New York City to
London. Professors Caulkins and
Vcrette headed the l974 Grinnell
delegation to London and
Professor Jordan and Lalonde will
replace them in 1975.

A less expensive travel option is
possible, according to Caulkins,
who is checking a charter flight
arrangement with Central College
on else. This cooperative charter
flight between Grinnell and Cen-
tral College was employedplast
year, but may not be leasible this
year due to the academic calendar.
Central presently plans departure
a Week later than Grinnell. The
CIEE arrangement flies from New
York City to Paris lor $335.

A third suggestion was offered
by John Benecki, a 1975 par-
ticipant. Benecki had researched
the option ol travel by ship. In his
View, the Russain of Polish lines
could be traveled for around $280.

Banking while in London was the
next financial burden discussed.
Most of the former Londoners
advised obtaining a Bank-
americard or American
Express Card to facilitate
availablity oi spending money.
Traveler's checks were recom-
mended for their ease of cons
vertability. The strongest warning
given by last year’s group was to
plan ahead two to three weeks lor
money needs due to mail delay to
and from the US.

A survey was taken during the
fifth week of the 1974 program to
determine weekly housing and food
costs. The results of this survey
were presented to the 45 new
Londen members.

Expenses for one week averaged
$21.55 ior housing. Food, on the
average, ran $16.38. The lowest
prices given for these items were
$13 for housing and $7 for food.
Housing at its highest totaled
$33 and food went to $30. The total
weekly expenditure averaged $40 a
week. 1974 Program Director v,s.
Vcrrette suggested counting on an
inﬂationary factor oisioo, bringing
the total to $700 for housing and
food.

This was the first formal
gathering of the 1975 program The
purpose oi discussing iinancial
matters now Was to allow students
the chance to talk to parents or
guardians during spring recess, By
vacation, letters will be mailed to
parents requesting statements ol
flnancial responsibility, and
medical releases.

Alter vacatlon, the group will
reconvene to take up curricular
matters: and . preregister.

erases
students

Student schedules for the current
semester were eliminated from the
data bank of the computer ap-
proximately ten days to two
weeks ago, The cause of the
erasure is unknown, according to
Computer Services Director,
Jmaes McDonald.

The missing schedules were
discovered after the Registrar's
Officrrigequested a printing of the
midseinester check of student
schedules, Dean of Records
Charles Seller noted. The problem
has been solved though according
to Seller, because his office has
back up records His office is
presently in the process of
manually updating these schedules
with changes made after
registration.

The manually updated records
will be forwarded by the
Registrar’s Office to the Computer
Center to be placed into the data
bank. The information must be
replaced in order to print and
distribute grades at the end of the
semester

Seller stressed that no in-
formation prior to this semester’s
student schedules were lost.

For the last three Fridays, the
computer has been inaccessible to
students The College has been
attempting to connect the com-
puter to the University of Iowa
computer. Before the acquisition of
the college's own computer, the
link to the University was through
a 3780 terminal. The new computer
can not operate through the old
link, causing massive physical
Changes to be made McDonald
stated that a meeting with the
University of Iowa is planned for
next week to find the cause of the
erasure.

In order to complete the cone
nection to the University, the
college has to establish with
General Telephone and then also
the Bell System in which Iowa City
is included. Once. contact is
established, the University's
computer will be programmed to
‘recognize’ the Grinnell computer.

The problem with linkage has
caused considerable problems.
Linkage can be attempted only
once a week and in order to do so
the University computer must be
shut down to all other users. These
include fourteen other Colleges and
a few high schools in the state.

Users can currently Corns
municate with the college's
computer from remote locations on
campus, but can not make con-
nections the Iowa City computer.

This weekend, the remaining
problem of calling the University
computer will be worked on by
people coming from Milwaukee,
Massachusetts, Davenport. and
Des Moines. McDonald stated that
they “are pulling all stops to get it
working this weekend," because
the lease on the IBM equipment
expires in about 3 days, At that
point, the college will have to
return the equipment, but will be
unable to do so unless the new
computer is iunctioning,
