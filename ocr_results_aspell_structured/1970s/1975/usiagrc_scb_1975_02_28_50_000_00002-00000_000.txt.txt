telaere, the emphasis will be on
developing counseling skills and
technique. “There is no exs
pectation that S,A.’s will be
professionals; rather, the training
program will concentrate on
specitic counseling ‘skillsi
listening, information gathering,
developing alternatives, crisis
counseling, ethics, etc,” she
stated.

The training will be done in
weekly meetings with the Resident
Advisor, using video tape, role
playing and personal assessment
exercises. “This will provide ex
cellent experience for anyone
interested in the fields of counr
seling, social work, or any or the
helping professions as a Career,”
