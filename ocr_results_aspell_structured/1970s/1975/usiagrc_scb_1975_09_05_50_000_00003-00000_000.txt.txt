The Grinnell Scarlet and Black, September 5.1957—11. 3

PDP 7745 unhooked from Iowa City—

3 Computer Services comes of age

I By Doug Schultz

I wasn‘t going to be impressed. I
just knew I wasn’t going to be
impressed. I shouldn‘t have had
such prejudices, bias being against
good reporters' ethics, but I’d
always found computers Coldi
impersonal. I was sure Grinnell's
new PDP 1145 (even their names

y are coldiwhy not Lucy or Bill?)
‘ wasn‘t going to be much different
as I approached the Computer
A Services for the latest routine
news. My leelings were im-
mediately confirmed as I entered
the building annexed to the west
side of Darby. A cold blast of air
shocked me as I left the humid 90
Q’ degree heat'outside. Even the door
handles were frigid.

Inside was another WurId~
futuristic, like a space center,
pitifully clean with ultra-modern
architecture. But simplistic, and
cold, not like the old Grinnell home
i had yust lett, with its warm
woodwork, carpeting, and no air-
conditioning.

While my prejudices about

\computers were not to be wholly
eradicated, they were dulled
somewhat, I was in for a rather
pleasant surprise toward the end of

‘my interview with Mark Grunler,
new director of computer services,
who replaced James McDonald
after his resignation last spring.

Grundler, who has worked with

‘ computers for 10 years, came to
Grinnell last lall to work as an
assistant. director of Computer
services. Prior to coming here he
had been at the University of Iowa
at Iowa City. Familiar with their
computer, he was a valuable
resource when Grinnell‘s come
puter was linked to iowu City, a
source of many problems last year.

When the time came to name a
new director. Grundler ap»

7....proached the selection committee
and told them that since he had
)een working with this particular
computer and its problems longer
than any of the other candidates,

‘4.— he felt he was the best man for the

.ipb. Apparently they agreed.

The multitude of problems which
arose last year, and in part forced
McDonald’s resignation, were two
foldimechariical and ad-
ministrative. Grinnell's computer
was linked to lowa City initially

because that computer held much
information, from academlc
programs to administrative
records, which Grinnell’s did not,
That setrup soon meant more
troubles than it was worth.

Seven other colleges were using,
the computer in Iowa City, Some of
Grinnell’s systems, such as
grading and credit~granting
procedures, were unique and did
not fit in with others in the com-
puter. Furthermore, such a link-up
meant there were three or four
distinct places for major problems
to occur, making maintenance that
much more difficult, It somcming
was not right at either end of the
line, it could be along one or both of
two telephone systems connecting
them. Topped oil with a basic lack
of communication, one had royal
problems. Both first and Second
semester’s grade reports were a
month or more late due to com-
puter malfuntions.

For the most part, Grinnell is
now running on its own system.
According to Grundler,
registration went “smoothly, in
record time in fact.” With a little
bitof testing and a trial run or two,
grade reports could he done within
24 hours alter all data is collected.

I was slightly impressed.

The other major problem last
year was simply one of un-
derstaffing. Not only was
the director in charge of ad-
ministering and maintaining the
computer and its seryices, but he
was also teaching courses in
computer science,

This year, Tom Moberg was
hired as an instructor in computer
science as well as a statistician
familiar with the Iowa City link.

Moberg and Grundler, along
with faculty members and
students, are developing programs
for the computer that can be used
in all departments and areas oi
endeavoretrom pure statistics to
computer graphics. They have just
recently received a matching
grant from the National Science
Foundation to do research in
graphics. science, and math

But Grundler stressed that,
above all, any student has access
to the computer, from 7 (“‘8 am,
to sometimes one or two in the

morning. Usage assistants are
there to help those who have little
experience with computers.

Essentially, the computer is a
tool {or the college to use in
research in all departmenm, from
biological analysis to linguistics,

Besides the time it will save in
doing research, Grundler em-
phasized that exposure to the
computer alone is valuable to the
student, as the “world out there"
becomes more and more com-
puterized.

Grundler said he was surprised

at the number of freshmen

familiar with computers this year
and the level of expertise of those
he has met. But he said he has seen
first and second graders in cities
such as Des Moines learning to use
computers, and he expects them to
continue using computers as a tool
throughout their education. He
sees the computer, therefore, as a
valuable recruiting attraction for
the college.

I was impressed.

One of the most modern facilities
of its kind, the PDP does most jobs
in half the time it takes other in-
stallations. According to Grundler.
it has “unlimited capabilities.”

I had to see this “wonder" for
myself.

We passed through a room full of
terminals. I could sense its
presence alreadyea bewildering
feeling, We then approached the
door that would bring me face to
face with the heartless complex of
circuits and lights. But as we en-
tered the room, where it stood like
a monolith, 1 was astounded. it was
warm, a pleasant surprise from
the 65 degree climate oi the outer
office. Warmth radiated from the
