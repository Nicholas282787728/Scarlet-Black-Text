iiEood budget

3The new proposed SGA constitutional amendment con-
tains provisions for the overhaul for the old system of budget
approval. According to the measure approved on last
Wednesday night, the budgets for coming years will be
prepared jointly by both the old and new cabinets. The new
cabinet will be elected in March and serve an “internship"
with the old cabinet until May. The budget will be approved
after spring break, but the old president and vice-president
ill be around to advise the new people.
This proposal, which will go up for an allocampus vote, is
more than a compromise proposal. It actually serves all
hose involved more readily than the original proposals did.
«a is one of those ideas which should have come to mind long

ago.

The amendment, will remedy the problem of frenzied year»
. .d budget preparations (editorial of Oct. 31), but will not
ake away the power of the new cabinet to make its own
budgetary decisions. If the two cabinets cannot work
together, a “safety clause" has been provided, which allows
for a thirty-day budget revision period at the beginning of
the new academic year. So if the ”internship" fails, there can
still be room for educated change.
We support the adoption of this new amendment and urge
the student body to vote for passage of this much needed

inform.

Phony liberalism at Grinnell

To the Editor:

When I arrived on the grounds of
Grinnell College two years ago as a \
prospective student, Grinnell
seemed to be a very liberal in-
stitution With many liberal
students. Alter I got here and
settled down I didn't see liberalism t
at all. But I did see it used as a
“front” becausc of the desire of a

during Black Cultural Weekend. To
me this is a good indication of

Vl‘lere the attitudes of the “liberal

students” are coming from.

Sure we will praise a movie that

was ﬁlmed 30 years ago thathas no
significance today, but we won’t

ake a couple of hours at our time

to observe an account of black
existence today, If the “liberal

lot oi students to attempt to studentsl'are againstsuchathing

separate themselves from then

as conventionalism,

then there

upper middlerclass backgrounds should have been a little better

and conventional homes All the

efforl and desire to find out about a

talkon Grinnell’s campusseems to race oi people with whom they

be liberal this and liberal that, but
you've got to mean it before you
can go around preaching it. In
other Words, there is a big dit»

attend classes and live with every
day.

The movie incident is just one

example of this indifference. What

{Hence in appearing to be liberal I’m trying to stress is that students

and actually being liberal. t

If there is so much liberalism on
this campus, then how come there
weren’t 20 white Students at the

ry to appear liberal by wearing

certain clothes, growing long hair,
and

organizations on campus. All these

Where You Save. . . Does Makes Diﬂerence

a place liberal. l have come to a
conclusion that deep down inside
the “liberal students,” they are not
much different from their con-
ventional parents. I can un-
derstand students wanting to be
liberal and being for positive
changes in satiety, but I can't
understand how mere appearances
can help them achieve a liberal
philosophy.

I have more respect for the
student who admits his Conn
servatism and explains it, than tor
the student who merely leads me
on to believe that he is liberal.
That’s just being a plain ordinary
phony.

To conclude, I think dial. in order
for students to be liberal they must
deserve that title and really be
sincere and truthful with themr
selves. Here on campus students
don't know quite what it takes to be
liberal.—Name withheld
