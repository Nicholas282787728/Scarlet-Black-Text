Siblings

Unlike some students who rarely
venture off the campus, members i
oi the Big Brother-Big Sister
program are getting involved with
people in the town. The program
had a meeting Wednesday night
where students chose little
brothers and sisters from a list of
names provided by Audrey
Pedersun, counselor for Grinnell
schools, Throughout the year, each
student will meet individually with
their little brother or sister as well
as participating in parties with the
entire group,

The program is now in iLs sixth
year in Grinnell. It was started by
Wes Fu i, a college Student. This
year Al Clark is chairman of the
group. Clark was pleased with‘
Wednesday night‘s turnout
However, he commented, “I have
about on kids and only about 30 Big
Brothers and Sisters so tar.

“ii there is anyone interested in
the program I would appreciate
them getting in touch with me at
Ext. 254 or Box 1091. There‘s a
definite need to help these kids‘.’
Clark explained that he had a littl

brother last year. This year he isl
going to continue seeing him as‘
well as meet with and get to know
another little brother. ”It was
really a riot," he stated. “I had a ,
lot at fun and became very close to
my little brother." 1

“It’s a line program," come
merited Davida Alperin “It‘s not
like working for a political came
paign where your candidate may
lose as well as win, and many
times you don‘t seem to have any
direct impact. But in this you see
the kid Smile and react directly to,
you."

Pedersnn explained that usually
she asks teachers to recommend
kids who would beneﬁt by having
Big Brothers or Sisters, However,,
this year, Pederson chose the
children herself, Some of them are
handicapped, however most oi
them are kids who just need some
attention.

Enthusiasm at the meeting
seemed high, Students were asking
about their perspective little
brothers or sisters. some were
making plans to call the families
later that night. When one girl
found out that her new little sister
lived on a {arm and has horses she
exclaimed, ”I found a fantastic
little sister.”
