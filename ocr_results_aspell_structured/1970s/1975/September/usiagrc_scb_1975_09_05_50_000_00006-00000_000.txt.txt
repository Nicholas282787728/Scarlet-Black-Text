Hepburn. by Charles Higham.

reviewed by Michael Chessler

I guess that a review at the best
selling biography of a best-selling
actress is not the place for any
pointed remarks about the
philosophy of biography writing, it
there is one, but the essential
failure of this work to offer much
more than a Collection of anec-
dotesr albeit interesting ones,
about the actress in question
makes one wonder ii the goals oi
such a study should be Set in a
realm other than the spuriously
conversational. Nonetheless, a
subject that invites fascinating
study and results in an oblique
testimonial inspires such
questions,

Any addict of the late night flicks
can probably tell you some in-
teresting lact about Katherine
Hepburn, either about her films or
her private life. l-ligham tries to
relate all of these, But while this
satisties the gossip impulse with
story alter story, in chapter alter
Chapltir‘the reader asks whether or
not the bulk of this biography
mightnot have been collected trom
an anthology of screen magazine
articles,

Without my seeming difficult,
this book has led me to ask why
write a “popular” biography when
the subject is so rife with material
tora study of greater depth Surely
Hepburn is more interesting as an
actress and more singular as a
public iigure than to warrant a
study that is more talkative than
probing. And this is where my
original question of the
“philosophy" of biography writing
comes up. (I will make it short).

Without invoking Boswell and
avoiding all reierence to any other
discussions on the matter (in other
words giving my own opinion) the
question of what‘ makes good
biography has always put the
writers of such auspicious tales in
the precarious position of being
continually unsure oi not only how
to present their researches, but
also what researches to present.

rs Matthews’ recent biography
of TS Eliot led many people to
reconsider this question It is no
coincidence that Auden left in-
structions in no uncertain terms
that no biography oi him be
written. And C01 sist -nt with this
fear and general distrust
Katherine Hepburn has made it a
point to avoid the biography
hunters

This book is more of a com-
parative interview (thin line here
between that and a biography)
than a biography in the true sense
oi the word. lligham’s joy in
bagging Hepburn tor the basic
series oi interviews that comprise
the skeleton of this book is not to
be demeancd, but in his job as
chronicler of herlile he might have
offered more.

without making his study a
critical biography to the exclusion
of the element of popular one
tertainment, a great deal oi
analysis of the films themselves is
wanting. The point here is that
Higham needn’t abuse his
privilege of being blessed with a
good subject by raking up all
aspects of her life to the point of
obscenity. He can present her lite
in a very respectable manner, as
he indeed has. But the public
product oi her liie, that which is
most immediate to the rest at us,
her tilrns, are ion as unscathed as
she is. Higham can write about his
subject's private lite with
prudence and respect while at the
same time treating her creative
efforts with a much more critical
eye.

Katharine Hepburn was a
radical before her time. Coming
from a home where the child’s
right to free expression was never
doubted, she had her own deeply
felt views on a number of matters,
She wore pants continually when it
was still treated with scorn, she
had very definite views about
marriage, and was in general a
lighter for womens rights betore it
became imperative.

“Marriage is a series of
desperate arguments people ieel

The Corner

passionately about,” she says.
Further, “an actor should never
marry, not even another actor,

’You're too involved with yourself."

Early in her career, though,
Hepburn married socilite Ludlow
Ogden Smith. The marriage lasted
three weeks. 0n the event Higham
notes that, “she much preferred
him when he was not physically
and domestically her husband, and
in tact he became her life-long
friend.

Always the individualist, her
future relations would follow the
some lines, without the mistake oi
marriage Higham brings this out
in her friendship with Howard
Hughes: “She was enormously
attracted to hi : he was an in-
dividualist, an isolated loner, and a
hypochondriac, who brought out
the nurse in hero”

Hepburn is one oi those people
who never thought twice about
saying what was on her mind. The
set of A Bill of Divolrement
presented one of those op-
portunities. As Higham .‘elates:

“After playing her first scene
with Barrymore, she was heard to
mutter, ‘He's all beaten up He's
overacting.‘ l' Between takes that
first day, Barrymore invited her
into his dressing room. Once there,
without warning he ilung all his
clothes off, Kate was astounded
