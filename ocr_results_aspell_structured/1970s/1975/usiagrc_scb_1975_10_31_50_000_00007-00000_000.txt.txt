Dear Editor:

Twenty angry women, (com
prising quite a tormidahle listl,
wrote a letter to the last issue at
the 5&3 to insult and condemn the
author of lands and her series oi
columns on the lite and trials oi the
Grinnell woman, According to

ilheir letter, among other vile
deeds, Ms. Kramer is
treacherously “Ioisting” women
back into the stereotyped icmole
loles that these twenty injured
women have struggled so
energetically to avoid. it

asionishes me how they have
endowed the columniscwith such
an abundance oi power and in-
fluence over women here.

But perhaps if these Sells
righteous twenty were not so ob»
viously irightened and insecure in
their own sell-images, they might
divine some vague inkling of [he

columnist's true intent. it they
could overcome their laughably
childish yindictivcuess, they might
realize that though her articles are
indeed Critical of Grinnell women,
they are critical with a hoperully

criticisms of women’s [cars
weaknesses, and sell~deceptions, it
is apparent that she wishes her
readers to_critically analyze
themselves in the light of her ob-
servation . to find something of
themselves in the models she
creates,

However, maybe the outraged
twenty behcve that his. Kramer’s
column would be more
enlightening it she continually
Commended Grinnell women for
some preteneded activism and
moral courage, when in actuality
many women obviously do sit alone
in their rooms and teel miserable,
lonely, and helpless. If these
twenty think that such pandering
lies are the route to liberation. I
sincerely doubt that any oi them
will advance farther than a sub-
