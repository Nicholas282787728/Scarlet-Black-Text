by a very loud group around 2 am,
and that, upon investigating the sit»
nation, he discovered Williams,
Erichiord, and Ebert sitting in the
third floor hallway. Heasked them to
leave, and they eventuallydid, Later
he discovered a screen in a restr
room window bent in half and a rad-
iatol‘ cover broken off the wall.
His assumption that the accusedhad
entered the building through that
window and thus caused the damage
was the only evidencepresented durr
ing the hearing in support of the
destruction of property charge.

SGA Vice President John Pfeffei,
a Read resident. was the next wit-
ness questioned. He was “booking"
in his room at about 2 am. when
he heard the noise. He looked out
a second story window over the
logia, and was hit with water from
a tire extinguisher held by Clay
Williams. Pfeffer added that two
BdiG workers arrived at about this
time, and the group broke up and
headed off in several directions.

Charles Taylor, a James resident,
testified that he was awakened by
“a bunch or people dancing and sing—
ing on the logia roof”. A low min—
utes later, he continued, Clay Wil~
liams “pounded" on his door and
“demanded" to use his window to
gain access to the root, When Tayr
lor relused, he said, Williams be
came abusive. “Williams said,
‘You’d better lock your door or I’m
going to get you’. i was unnerved.”
Taylor added that a few minutes lat-
er a large quantity of beer was
poured into his room through the
window leading to the roof.

The final three WitnessesﬁNick
Eurhules, James Gates. and Paula
McDermott-»admitted to being a
part oi the group during one part
of the night or another. All three
admitted that the group was loud
and was drinking, but none admitted
to seeing the accused using lire exr
