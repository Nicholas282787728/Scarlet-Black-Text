Amphibs make splash

Women third at Ames

by Dave Schechter

Despite finishing third in last
Saturday's Iowa State meet, this
Week had an anticlimatic tone to it
following the women’s Miracle
Relays of two weeks ago In fact, it
was only decided this past week
that Grinnell would drop its protest
over Kearney State’s win at the
Miracle Relays,

Tomorrow Grinnell faces
Carleton for the first time in
women‘s competition. Com-
menting that Carleton has a strong
overall women’s athletic program.
Grinnell Coach Mike Daley says he
expects tough competition.

Key Grinnell performances this
past weekend came from the zoo
yard medley relay team and
Virginia Munoz in the 20d freestyle.
The medley relay team of Margo
Wessner, Gail Machala, Munoz,
and Sheryl Huntoon placed second
with a school record time of 2108.6.
Munoz clocked 212.6 for a school
record in the 200, and earned
another third place in the 100
butterﬂy. Wessner finished third in
both the 50 and 100 backstroke
events.

Daley noted that Grinnell placed
“about as expected." He felt that
rugged competition from Iowa
State had a “psyching out" effect
on his squad.

Iowa State won the meet with 399
points, followed by the University
of Iowa, 247; Grinnell, 172; Luther,
ill; and Northern Iowa, 106.

troubles, but not without some
good news, The Pioneers went to

The Carleton Carls defeated the
Grinnell varsity basketball teami
9181 last Saturday in Northfield,
and the Pioneers will be lookingtr
revenge tomorrow as the Carls
come to Darby Gym

The visitors own a 7-5 lea e
record, which, surprisingly, 3
them in third place. Grinnell is 5-3
and in Sixth spot, Overall, the
Pioneers are 5712. They haye
compiled a 4.2 record at homegi’.
are no on the road.

If Grinnell wins one more game
this year, it will equal last year‘s
conference record, Head Coach
Ron Mitchell says he thinks this
year’s squadhasproven to be more
talented than last year’s, even
though the records will not be
much different. He notes more
bench strength and more back-
court scoring as the main P
provements.

After tomorrow’ 5 contest,
Grinnell ends its season with two
home games next weekend against
the twotop loop teams, Corrie
Coe. Their combined record is 21-3.

At Carleton last week, Pioneers
Scott Lewis and John Haigh
combined for 37 points, but it was
not enough to overcome Carlet
advantage in trips to the foul line.
The Carls shot 32 free throws to
Grinnell's 18, and registered 12
more oneapointers than the
Pioneers. Grinnell trailed by only
two points with three minutes to
go, but the Carls then opened up
the game.

Haigh still trails the conference’s
top point-maker by three~tenths of
a tally in league averages, but he is
now chasing Cornell’s Bury
Hopkins. The leader for most a e
season, Coe's Leonard Cooper, ids
dropped behind Haigh into third
place.

The Grinnell junior varsity temp
played its first game in two t,
and fell to William Penn, 57-59,
there last Monday. Coach John
Hicks-Hershey said he thought the
team was at a disadvantage
because several players were not
able to practice the preceding
weekend. Joe Kingma and Bill
Knox were Grinnell’s high scorers,
but Hicks-Hershey said he thought
Mark Blanchard turned in the best
overall performance.

Drive for timer to start Sunday

by Tom Rownt

This Sunday and the two Sundays
following, the PEG pool will be the
sight fora joint effort on the part of
the college and community in an
attempt to raise funds for an
electronic timing device. This
electronic timing device would be
complete with touch activated
pressure pads at the finish line and
would be accurate to one one-
thousandth of a second. Other
features of the timing device are
the elimination of human error in
both the timing and the judging of
close finishes.

The fund raising effort is divided
into three categories. The first is
the Celebrity Swim this Sunday at 1
pm. followed on the next two
Sundays by Swimra-Longs for
endurance by the various coma
petitive swimming groups
in the city The celebrity
Swim features four-man relays
with each man to swim one lap of
the PEG pool Approximately forty

teams have paid the twenty dollar
entry fee with teams coming from
the doctors, lawyers, other
business firms, as Well as four
teams from the college. Some of
the college‘steam members will be
John Martinek, John Worley,
Roger Koester, Mo Hunt, Ray
Obermlller, Barry Huff, Susan
Wittpenn, Sue Crim, Mike Daley,
Dianne Ruyffelaerc, Jim Teder-
man, and John Pfitsch.

The following two Sundays will
see both the women’s and men’s
college teams as well as the city
age group team swim in an en
durance effort to raise money.
Each swimmer seeks pledges at a
certain rate per lap that they
swim. The sponsor then pays to the
timing device fund the rate per lap
times the number of laps the
Swimmer can swim in one hour.
This is a very popular form of fund
raising and has raised large
amounts of money for other groups
in the past, '

The timing device itself will cost
an estimated six thousand dollgs
The device can time for six lanes in
swimming and also is capable of
use in track and field timing. It is
hoped that the money will be raised
in the Celebrity Swim and the
SwimaaaLongs. if the money is not
raised this year the Swimrarlong
concept will be repeated next year
to raise the balance of the cm
