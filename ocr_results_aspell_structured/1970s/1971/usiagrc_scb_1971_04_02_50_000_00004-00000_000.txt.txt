Bookstore Budget Told

by Carolyn Ashbaugh

Part II: More on the Financial
Considerations

The college operates the
bookstore, which falls under
auxiliary enterprises in the
budget. No outside chain has
any financial interest in the
bookstore, and the manager's
job is strictly a salariedposi-
tion. Any profits which the
bookstore generates return to
the generaloperatingfund, and
the college absorbs any losses
.it sustains. Vice ’president
Lambie released the following
ﬁgures for the fiscal year
1969-70 concerning the book
store operation:

Y/E 6‘30‘ 70

Net $1378 1.0%
The figure with which the
business officeprimarily con
cerns itself is the percent of
gross profit. (In the 196970
fiscal year, 23.3%) This figure
should reflect, in the estima-
tion of Mr. Lambie, any dras-
tic increase in shoplifting. It

has remained relatively cons
stant over the past several
years. Mr. Lambie does not
anticipate a martable increase
in this figure with the addi-
tion of new items for sale in
the addition to the bookstore,
but would hope that the gross
profit figure would reach25%.
The figures indicate a 1%
profit margj. However, exe
penses of light, heat, book-
keeping (which is done downs
town), postage and insurance
‘which the collegeprovidesare

L not figured ’lﬂto these expens
ses. Neither is the amortize-

ment on the addition to the
bookstore. Thus, in reality,
the bookstore has been oper'
ating in the red, and the c017

PerCent lege has subsidized its oper-

ation.

Mr. iambic speculated that
the larger area might encour-
age a shift in the balance be—
tween the percentage of book
sales and supply sales (sups
plies include everything he-
sides books) which mightalter
the gross profit figure. When
asked about the effect of the
curriculum change upon the
bookstore, Mr. Lambie anst
wered, "This is nOt to reflect
upon the desirability of the
change, but it is going to cost
the bookstore money." Again
the high cost of returns, inn
accuracy in ordering and the
diversity of books ordered
enters the picture.

Mr. McEee said that 25% of

Wilhelm And Neuman File lawsuits

Henry Wilhelm and Krystyna
Neuman have each filed new
lawsuits during spring break.
Henry is seeking $5,000 damr
ages from S-R Publishing Co—
mpany of Wilton Junction, Io-
wa, in a suitwhichstems from
the seizure of copy andphOtos
of the Pterodactyl, Grinnell’s
now defunct underground
newspaper, onMarch13,l969.

Krystyna accuses Cedar
Falls Mayor William w. Mc-
Kinley and assismnt Black
Hawk County AttorneyAllen E.
Olsen of illegally seizing and
destroying a number of her
photographic negatives on N07
vember 19, 1969, also in cons
nection with Pterodactyl.

Henry has a $50,000 suit
pending against Grinnell Col-

lege which stems from the
worldsfamous Playboy inci-
dent in February of1969. That
suit is still mired in technical
difficulties surrounding such
important legal questions as
“What is the proper name for
Grinnell College?” (Answer:
The Trustees of Iowa Col*
lege). Henry and the college
have both filed two briefs; it
is now Henry’s turn again.
Henry’s publishing company
dispute has a court date set
for May; and the company has
expressed an interest in sett'
ling the case out of court. The
idea behind the ,suit comes
from none Other than Iowa
Atty. Gen. Richard M. Turner.
Turner and his agents were
found guilty of illegal seizure

Vote On Cigarette Machines

leggett Hands Down
Visitor Policy

The college administration
has issued a new policy state-
ment that declares they will
have any "uninvited or unr
registered visitor" about
whom complaintsare received
removed from campus.

The statement, released by
President Glenn Leggett to the
campus community Thursday,
also says thatthe college shall
"take any other legally san»
ctioned apiipn believed ap
propriate for the protection of
college persons and pres
perty."

The statement implies an
apparent administration belief
that transients may be rest
ponsible for some of the im
creased theft and damage to
college buildings.

The 8&8 shall analyze the
new statement, its rationale
and some reaction to it, in an
article to be printednext week.

all cigarette vcnding mach-
ines. The rationale for the
latter suggestion, as submitr
ted to the Senate by Jared
Gottlieb, is as follows:

The Senate should cause the
cigarette vending machines to
be removed from campus.

Cigarettes are one of the
major causes of death today.
It has been the policy of the
Senate to oppose unnecessary
fatalities. Therefore removal
of these machines would help
to prevent these deaths.

The growing of tobacco is
against good ecologiiral prac-
tice. Tobacco plants wear out
the soil they are grown in.
Furthermore the crop that is
grown is put to no beneficial
use, but rather is burned and
wasted.

Tobacco smoke within build-
ings causes air pollution proV
blems.

For these reasons I urge you
to remove the cigarette vendr
ing machines.

by Iowa courts in the case, a
ruling which the Supreme Co~
urt recently refused to over
turn.

Part of Turner's defensewas
his contention that thecom-
pany had turned the materials
over to him voluntarily and
that therefore he had seized
nothing. The suit echoes this
allegation that “The company
voluntarily and illegally tr-
ansferred the newspaper’s
copy and photographs to age
ents who handed them over to
Turner.

Krystyna took the negatives
which she alleges were seized
while she and three others
were being arrested at the
University of Northern Iowa
for distributing Ptero. The
four were all charged with the
distribution and sale of alleg-
edly obscene material (Ptero).
Her film was impounded as
evidence.

The charges were dropped
in May of 1970 when a county
District Judge ruled that the
obscenity law was unconstitu-
tional; however, when she
tried to get her pictures back,
ten negatives were missing.
The district judge ruled that
the pictures mustbe returned;
but Krystyna's lawyer quotes
Mayor McKinley as saying,
"l'll burn them before I’ll
give them lack."

Applications for thefullnyear
jobs of editor and business
manager of the Scarlet and
Black are now open. All applir
cations must be in the mailbox
of 5&8 advisor HerbertPres-
cott by Friday noon of next
week.

The application should in-
clude a statement of qualifi-
cations, plus a list of plans
for the paper.

Next year’s business mana-
ger will most likely receive a
salary of $200; he will work
with an advertising and a cir-
culation manager withslightly
lesser salaries. The jobs were
all combined this year.

The editor's salary will be
$500, with an option for him to
divide part or all ofit among
his staff as he sees fit.

Fun In Ecology, Or The Green n9 Oi Grinnell

by J. C. Labowitz

At the risk of sounding like
Mrs. Hutton’s fourth grade
class writing about What I
Did Over Spring Break, I
would like to introduce this
week’s opus by recountingso-
melhlng‘lhat happened to me
over break. I was skiing in
Colorado on an absolutely
beautiful day, with clean air,
incredible mountains and gen-
eral all around natural beauty
(for further poetic descrip~
lion, don‘t watch this space).
Anyway, I was skiing down
this mountain, which is pretty
exhilirating in itself, when a
guy went past me and he had
a set of earphones on and was
grooving to some tunes from
a cassette recorder thathe had
over his shoulder. Thatstruck
me as incredible — 1am res
ferring him to LEAP for either
remedial instruction or im-
mediate recycling.

All of this brings us to that
topic of topics— ecology. While
I have not been buying any US
Steel or Boise>Cascad2 stock
lately, and I did write my eons
gressman about the SST (hur»
ray for concerned citizenry),
I have been attempting to as
sess priorities on this thing
and, to put it simply, lam

logy.

So, you ask, what'l7 I have
been disgusted, during my
three years at Grinnell, about
one specific case of ecology
raping. This is something that
the majority of students see
every day and may add to
themselves, sometimes while
they are walking to the post
office to read about the latest
efforts to save the Grinncll
ecology. I am referring to the

piece of ground immediately
outside ARI—l ll towards the
Women's Gym. At one time,
at least once since J. B. Grin'
nell arrived, that piece of gr-
ound had grass and an occasr
ional squirrel on it. Now, be-
sides a large number of stud»
ents every day,allthatisthere
is either mud or hardtpacked
dirt. Frankly, I am amazed
