H-R Editor Explains local Views

by Lynne Ogawa

A1 Pintler might easily be
called one of the most influ-
ential men in shaping townat-
titude towards Grinnell Cole
lege and its students. As
managing editor of the “Gri~
nnell Herald-Register,” he
oversees the production ofthe
paper that reaches over 90%
of the greater Grinnell comma
unity.

He feels that the "Grinnell
HeraldrRegister’s" role in
the community is to "report
accurately wtthouthysteria all
the news that occurs within
the area." He also feels
the paper should try to pro-
nwte the best possible rela'

tions between the studentsand,

townspeople. But Mr. Finder
does not see the HeraldrRen
gister as a public relation
organ for the college. “i
don't think it is the role of
the paper to report milk and
honey where there isn't any
but conversely, I don't think
it is the role of the paper
to make the vinegar ten times
worse."

Much of what students do is
of little interest to the town
and Vice versa, but in certain
sensitive areas ofmutual cone
cern, Mr. Finder says great
care is taken in writing the
stories.

One current area of mutual
concern is whether ornotcol-
lege students should be al-
lowed to vote where they at-
tend school. For Grinnell,
this question must be resolved
soon as a new school board
will be elected September 13.
Here, Mr. Finder disagrees
with Iowa Attorney General
Richard Turner who opposes
students voting at a college or

Luniversity town unless they
plan to reside there after
graduation. Mr. Finder st-
rongly stated, "I think Grin—
nell College students should
be permitted to vote." He
does not believe the student
vete would drastically change
election results. “I don't think

the student is one person.
They’re not going to be all
yes and they‘re not going to
be all no."

When asked about the town
attitude towards the college,
Mr. Finder said the "long
term attitude” is that Grinnell
College is an excellent sch-
ool which does an excellent
job. As for the "short term
attitude”, he said it blows
over very quickly.

He expanded on the “short
term attitude" and said: "All
of us have our sacred cows
and when you step upon them,
we react. It's just as dif’
ficult for me to accept some
of the things my children do
So many of us have been rai-
sad in a period (depression)
which is difficult to trans—
late into today’s times."

The major preoccupations of
the depression were food, clan
thing and shelter said Mr.
Pinder. Today, students do
not have these preoccupations,
but have other concerns”
racial problems, poverty, ecr
ology, warn-rand rightly so.
Still Mr. Finder cannOt fully
"translate” his value stanr
dards as tempered by the de-
pression, World War I], and
other value standards ofother
years. He also believes the
student cannot fully under-
stand his (Finder‘s) values as
they were shaped by other
times. "I think this is the
crux of the problem" he sta-
ted,"and the answer lies in
trying to understand and apt
preciate each other's views."
Mr. Finder first came to Gri-
nnell in 1949 when he and his
wife left Chicago to work on
the Grinnell HeraldrRegister.
She handled the society page
while he reported on general
news, tookpicturcs, developed
pictures-"did almost every*
thing that needed doing.

He has had no formal train‘
ing in newspaperwork and has

learned all that he knows thr‘
ough 22 years of practical ex-
perience. He likes the size
of the paper because it gives
him informality and freedom.
His staff of 21 work on a first
name basis and Mr. Finder
feels he can “do what must’
be done and say what must
be said."

He admits that when he first
came to Grinnell, he had pre-
conceived notions about the
town that "exploded” in time.
For example, he mentioned
metropolites regard small
midwest towns as provincial.
”It's simply not true!" he
declared. Grinnell, he be
lieves, is an unusual commu-
nity because of the collegeand
town combined.

pardize the credit-fail sys*
tem, the validity of giving
credit for a D grade will be
challenged.

in all probability there will
be some discussion as to the
validity of maintaining the D
grade within our grading SyS*
tent at all. Along with this
there will be a review of the
entire concept of grading and
our position in relation to
graduate institutions in this
matter.

A second question the com-
mittee may handle is that
of developing some specific
guidelines and restrictions for
drawing up independent ma-
jors. There is an increasing
number of students applying
for independent majors and it
has become necessary to cla-
rify the option.

There are several facets of
over-ail curricularevaluation
that also must be considered.
later in the fall there should
be a critical review of course
distribution as part of an on-
going evaluation of the no»
requirements system begun
second semester last year.

The committee may also res
View the course-evaluation
system that it instituted last
spring. The nature of the cure
riculum can be radically in-
ﬂuenced by the procedure of
reviewing andapproving court
ses.

Although the All-College
EPC has been very SUCCeSS‘
ful as a source of student
opinion, it is not necessarily
the most effective means of
involving students inacademic
decisions. The committee thus
has the responsibility of evar
luating itselfandpossiblypro-
posing an alternative, more
effective arrangement.

In the meantime, though, the
committee has considerable
influence in determining the
academic nature of Grinnell
College.

Coffee House

The second Coffee House Recordings Concert-~on the Ame-
rican Folk Tradition--will be played next Thursday afternoon
at 4:00 pm. The first concert reviewed the beginnings of
the three major developments of folk music: religious music,
country music, and the blues. Thursday's concert, Part II
of the series, will trace the development of the religious
music. The remaining two forms will be presented in sub-
sequent weeks.

It has been estimated that more than half ofall American
folk songs are religious in content or origin. Folk hymns,
shouts, anthems, jubilees, holy blues, gospel songs, and of
course the spirituals comprise a large part of our folk
herigage as well as contribute much to our modern Jazz,
soul, and rock forms.

Give Rare Book

Mr. and Mrs.3amucl Rosenthal have presented to the College
a copy ofa limited edition of the Gospels printed in 1963. The
book, one of only 320 copies, contains woodblock prints of
some of the works of Bartolomeo DiGiovanni (149%).

The text is set in Giovanni Mandersteig‘s Zeno type and
was printed on a hand press.

Mr. Rosenthal is a member of the College’s Board of
Trustees.

Phys Ed Complex
Sept. 20th is the date now set for the final opening of the
new Physical Education Complex.
Facilities for students will include courts for basketball,
volleyball, badminton, tennis, handball and squash, as well
as ranges for archery and golf and rooms for wreStling,
gymnastics and dance. Vending machines will provide refresh-
ments and study rooms will be open to those who wish to
combine study and recreation. Hours for the building will
be from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.
The swimming pool is already open to students and faculty.
Hours are posted at the pool.

Wilson Fellowships

This fall, for the first time in more than twenty years,
there will be no Woodrow Wilson Fellowship competition.
Among college professors, and those college seniors who
are thinking of becoming professors, this annual competition
has become as much a part of the fall term as football.

In announcing thatthe fellowshipprogram would be temporarily
suspended, H. Ronald Rouse, National Director of the Wood-
row Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, said, ”Funds cur
rently available to the Foundation for first year graduate
fellowships are being used to support over 200 Fellows
during the 197172 academic year. Frospects for securing
new funds are uncertain.

“During the coming year, trustees and officers of the Foun*
dation in cooperation with representatives of the academic
world, will design a new fellowship program taking into account
recent developments in graduate education and in the teaching
profession, and seek funds for this new program."

A total of 213 Woodrow Wilson Fellows will be supported
this year at 69 graduate schools. Fellowships are being held
in reserve for 25 others who have had to postpone graduate
study because of military or alternative service.

Uncle Sam’s Club

A Grinnell's Uncle Sam’s Club, made possible by studentvo-
lunteers, will soon begin this year's recreation program for
the children in the town of Grinnell. The club, located ina
clubhouse about a mile from campus, is an opportunity for
students to improve [Own’gOWl'l relations while also becoming
involved in a worthwhile program away from the pressures
of academia.

The clubhouse, which just received a coat of pann and new
curtains, will be open from 3:30 to 5:00, and from 7:00 to
9:00 Monday through Friday for high school and junior high
schooleaged groups.

Student volunteers are not burdened with the responsibility
of planning the activities (artsand crafts. games, dancing, etc.),
but anyone with new ideas is welcome to try them. Uncle
Sam's Club may also be used for the outside project required
of those students in Developmental Psychology.

More students are always welcome to help out for an after
noon or an evening a week. People are needed throughout
the semester. Anyone interested in the program should
contact Joan at X463, or Anne 8., at X 451.
