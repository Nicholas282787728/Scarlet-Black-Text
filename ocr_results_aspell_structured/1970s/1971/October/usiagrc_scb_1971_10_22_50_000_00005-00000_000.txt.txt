l—LEAP ‘
The Consciousness 0i Pollution

by Bill Knecht

Environmental pollution is essentially
the result oi two iactors: number one,
the mechanisms oi production and, num
per two, the mechanisms oiconsumption,
A lot is said about how we create things
that pollute the environment, but very
little is said on why we seem to get so
much pleasure in doing so.

polluting is really a very pleasurable
kind or activity. Whodnesn’t enjoyhaving
a car to drive around in, newspapers to
read, deodorant [0 keep us fresh and beer

proiligate seems to imply a sense DI
treedom—-a sense oi Matt's supremacy

taut it God had made us to be so tree,
he would have made us twice as smart
and hali as proliiic, so to speak, Nature
has the capacity to absorb the products
at our heady enyoyments, but only to a
certain degree. Man as a species can
only enyoy treedom and supremacy when
he has a very large resource and eis
ituent-absorbing base to support him in
his richness.

in our seemingly never-ending quest
tor sex we have managed to create more
little pleasuresseekers than the land can
manage. What we notice today as iecal
material and oil itoating on our waters
is just Nature‘s way oi telling us that
there are too many human beingsaround
doing too much pleasure—seeking,

Uniortunately tor us, we have sure
rounded our existence as a species with
an aura oi wrathiul righteousness. We
talk about "natural rights" to be tree.
or course, “ireedom” involvedtheireee
dam to squander resources, to dump toul
substances on our lands and in our
waters, and most oi all, to create
more than one replacement ior our
selves to carry on our habits oi “irees

Ii would go against a thousand lltlle
religious and social ethics to consider
that we lower our population to bring
Man and Environment back into hare

““m‘diiy. So,’in‘st"ead oi the 'sii'nple‘s'olue
tion, we must resort to a harder one.
i am speaking oi lowering perecapita
pollution,

Lowering industrial pollution will be
relatively easy Mass opinion and legis-
lation can be tocused on individual busi—
nesses to torce them to give up their
“rights” to squander and to pollute. The
real stickler comes when we consider
what kinds oi garbage each and every
one oi as is responsible ior every day
oi the week.

To eliminate some at this efﬂuent,
individuals would have to personally
consent to sacriﬁce some oflheil‘ “freer

dam" to consume and to waste, We
could no longer be tree to enjoy our
selves and to torget the world that is
responsible ior our wellsbeing,

To ask this is patently ridiculous, Who
will sacriiice freedom Ttiat is what
America stands ior.

The solution to this knotty problem is

not as diiiicult as it seems, We reiuse
to sacriiice our individual ireedoms,
but there is someone rigtit acrossi in
us who is more than happy to sacriiice
ours ior us Wading through his garbage,
we suddenly realize that no personal
sacriiice is necessary. As long as we
are content to live with his garbage, no
problem exists, Naturchas comethrough
ior us again, solving a problem we could
not solve ourselves Everything is iine
once more.

But gee whiz We iorgot that we no
longer have the ireedom to enyoy an
uhpolluted environment We get sick a
lot more than we used to The “wide
open spaces” we used to enyoy are a
lot less wide open. And there isn't a
place within twenty miles where we can
escape the sight oi a beer can. We iind
ourselves longing tor the “good old
days,"

Well sir, the good old days are gone
to stay Nostalgia doesn’t clean up the
roads And it looks like the old type oi
proiligate mentality has to go, too.
in thirty years we wan'thavethe“l'ighl”

apathy.

The whole situation sounds like para-

He could be ght Every man, woman

To ask tor a change oi consciousness
is to ask the impossible. America is the

oi those brave enough to spit in the eye

New Major Guidelines Decried

by Cardivn Asliliougli

Ttic guidelines regarding independent
mayors enunciated by the executive couhe
cit last week are a great disappointment
to those or its who looked upon the inde
pendent mayor as an expansion or inde
pendent study. The guidelines appear to
me to be designed to quell any indepene
deuce a student may wish to assert by
declaring an independent major

t perceive the decision as a move to-
ward curtailing independent study The
guidelines demand that the independent
mayor consist oi 32 credits or course
work exclusive oi independent study,
whereas other majors consist oi 32
credits including indcpcndont study
Tlllt‘tydwa credits oi course work re-
sults in a more rigid structure than any
at the institutionally deiined courses oi
study

with the exception oi a very iew, stue
dents were not consulted in these mats
ters The measure went rapidly iromtne
Academic Standing Committee through
the allscollege EPC (with iew modill»
cations and little dissent) and on to the
Executive Council An issue oi this
magnitude should tiave been brought to
the attention oi the student body.

Does Dean wall have the Dowel- to veto
an independent major, andwhat recourse
does a student have once denied his

decisions

As i see the independent mayor. it

Rock Garden:

“CHARITY BALL” is an album cut by
iour girls, and it's probably the iirst

is not to say that women haven't made it

Flack. etc etc. But ior some reason
there have never been any good allegirl
rock bands. however, this article is not
about women's lib and rock. (I never
could understand seeing thousands oi

talked oi girls who were “hunky tonk

that the group is still in the beginning

“Charity Ball”. This is the one that’s
been overplayed on the radio, but is ewe

and the vocals aretightand precise. Good
instrumentation with a heavy bass beat
gives the song drive,

“What Kind oi Lover” was written by
the organist/pianist, Nicky Barcly.
There is no doubt that she has the most
musical talent oi any oi the girls, both
in writing and in playing. Her voice

American Black Culture Defined

by Elliott Lewis

An important iactor in a reasonably
well iunctioning institution like Grinnell
is the successiul communication between
students, Parents andiaculty. Two weeks
ago an intormal rap was held between
each oi the three. Those participants
were Airl'»Amerlcan Studies protessor
v, Bray Thornton, Jazz pianist-music
director and iatheroilluane, Billy Taylor
and myselr, a concerned and inquisitive
Freshman. what started as a iriendly
discussion turned into one ot signiii-
cance tor Blacks and most people in
general.

The rap started more or less when
Mr. Taylor stated that American Black
culture is not that oi Airica nor is it
oi a European origin even thongii both
have played an important part in the
tormation oi the American black culture
“We have developed our own culture
which is more American than anything
else in this country, however, blackness
cannot be deitned in terms oi behavior
or art iorms like standing on the street
corner or the blues. its because or this
that there is such an identity crisis
going on right now. No one knows what
is supposed to be black and what lsn'| "

Mr. Thornton then said that this hust-
ling oi blackness is a mayor result oi
the identity crisis. “Those things that
are considered as black are now open
market ior commercial gimmicks This
is true in our cities and colleges in-
cluding Grinnell.”

“Thal reminds me very much ot a
program i was involved in, in which a
Jazzmobile would go around and give
periormances ior people who normally
never get the opportunity to see the

calibre oi entertainment that was being
presented Much oi the time the people
would yust wait around and see what
other people would do, could it be
considered acceptable without crowd
consent?

l interrupted by saying that i had
noticed thatthe Elack poweriront seemed
to be particularly importanthereon cums
pus because oi miseducation and mis-
understanding. l exemplitied my state-
ment by explaining the iacts behind the
nineteen black Freshman number that
has turned up tor the last three years
despite the iact that oi the so that air
plied in excess oi so were admitted. t
then said that this reeling oian unwritten
quota was yustiticd but bciore jumping
into action the right people should be
scen.

Mr. Taylor surmised that Grinnell,
as isolated and White as it is, Couldn't
possilily be the rigtit school ior every-
body, That could easily be a reason no
more than nineteen Blacks show up each
year, and the students, particularly the
blacks, should realize this it they are
presently unhappy with the Grinnell en-
vironment

"Its very possible” added Thornton
in response to Mr. Tnylor'sobsel'vatlon,
“Tllts is typical oi a slavctypcresponse
that has been prograined into so manyoi
our minds. This hole playing has tostop
in so many instances it is entering to
what whites expect to see and what they
want to see Irom rtlacks in a Black
cottltltultlly."

“Tile tecling is today that blacks may
be looking tor a supermarket type cote

lege where you can get anything you
want." explained Mr. Thornton “and
because oi that so much exploitation oi
black students is taking place in our
colleges and sometimes by the other
black students in the college."

Bockoning a response on the iact that
a number oi black students had gone to
Chicagos Black Expo Mr. Taylor said,
“Its a big event and a iinegesturebut so
much oi it is a one man show. Every
thing Couldn’t possibly be eiiectively
covered. For instance, David Baker
irom lndiana university wasn't asked
to help supervise the musical activities
and he should have been the tirst."

t then asked isn’i that a iorm oi a race
ripoii in that so many oi the well in-
tentioned events turn into iarces and
deieat their entire purpose?

Agreeing, Mr, Thornton said “Every
brother simply is not a brother. And
you'll iind that is particularly true here
where so mucti hustling oi Blackness is
going on,"

The discussion continued ior well over
two and a halihours with many otherideas
and experiences given. As tar asa reso—
lution was concerned, none was reached
where it was seen as impossible to res-
solvc the massive iininber oi problems
facing young people, young black people
anti young black students, My personal
gain or such a discussion can only be
rcilcctcd as a boost to my broadening
realizations on the art oi being Black.
l ieel that many otthe things said were
representative oi those members oi the
community being represented and is a
positive sign tor a radical change oi
things to come in the very near tuture.

(The executive council says 32.) More
specitically, i would see such topics
as Marxist impactonthe socialsciencos,
Airican studies, or Asian studies as
valid subjects oi independent mayors ior
which there are not suiiicient courses
available at Grinnetl to meet the recent
requirements oi the Executive Council.
(Mr. Guroliwouldarguethatpeoptewishe
ing to concentrate in these areas should

The point is that i see education as pro-
viding a methodology ior study, not as
providing all the "facts” a person needs
to know. My experience with educationis
that one learns by doillgwtllat is, unless
someone actually does original research

mind that Gl'lnnell students go elsewhere
(an ACM programs, ior example) to do
essentially to credit independents. Ale
though Grinnelt College at the present
time is not structuredto i eadilyaccomoe
date such projects (to iaculty loads,
which need examining apart iiom this
issue), i think the college could accomo»
date a limited number now and should
continue to allow the expansion oi indea

i will concede that at the present time
the increasing move toward independent
study deprives classes~nntl thus other

those students engaged in independent

would do well to attempt to institutions

emanates irom the iaculty, which holds
the monopoly on knowledge, i would see
desirable an increased emphasis on stu-
dent discussions and presentations re~
garding both academically recognized
independent proyects and other special

it remains my iii-m conviction that it
is the sole responsibility oi each s|u~

that each student accept this responsis
