The Surface of Maite Laurids Brigge:
The Search for a Compositional Principle

by
Pat O’Connor

Part I

Malte laurids Brigge is learning to see. "I don't
know why it is, but everythingpenetrates more deep-
ly into me and does not stop at the place where until
now it always used to finish. Ihave an inner self of
which I was ignorant. Everything goes thither now.
What happens there I do not know."The "inner self"
Brigge is discovering is something very much like
Aristotle’s sensus comunus, an organ of sorts com*
mon to the higher animals, in which sensory per-
ceptions are organized into experience, memory,
imagination, dreams; the impact ofa total percep-
tion--visual, auditory, tactile**is not rendered by
the individual senses themselves, but by a composi»
tion of separate stimuli which we may call “exper-
ience”, and which is always much more than the
sum of its perceptual parts. Brigge’s problem in
the beginning of the book is to account for this
process of composition, and to define for himself
what it is that his “inner self" adds to his exper-
ience over and above mere perception.

Before Brigge can ask who he is, he must define
what he is; that is, how does he perceive, and what
is his relationship with the external world on the
most elementary level. Brigge is a surface, and his
senses are a set of surfaces. His “contact" with
reality at this point stops with his skin, his ear-
drums, his eyeballs. He is a blank sheet of paper,
a mirror, a passive set of impressions. "I am the
impression that will change." (P. 52) But then we
must ask, “Is a human beinga surface?" or "Is he
a hollowness, a void, an area of non-beingwhich has
been merely covered over with a surface which,
while it defines the emptiness inside, also separates
it from the environment?” Is Brigge's surface a
barrier between him and reality, or is it the means
whereby he may contact it?

We find in the Notebooks many instances ofexzreme
paranoia surrounding images of surfaces breaking.
One of the earliest in Brigge’s life occurs at the
house of his grandfather, Count Erahc. Inside the
Count’s large, vaulted dining hall, twelvenyear-old
Brigge feels totally engulfed in its "darkening
height, with its never quite clarified corners"
(P. 31), and, unable to define the boundaries of the
room, he loses sight of his own surface.

. . . it sucked all images out of one without

giving one any definite substitute for them.

One sat there as if dissolved; entirely with-

out will, without consciousness, without

desiro, without defence. (P. 31)

Without defence! It seems that Brigge here sees the
periphery of his body as somehow protecting him
from the intensity ofdirect experimentalcontact with

reality. It would surely have been much too heavy an
experience for a little child to “see"a flower stand
up and cry ”Red" (P. 24), or to “hear” a shattered
window-pane, "its big splinters laugh, its little ones
snicker". (F. 14) At least if the childwere comfort-
able, not to say safe, within his own skin. Remember
how Brigge extracts himself from the void of the
agonising dining-hall situation?

I remember that at first this annihilating

state almost caused me nausea; it brought

on a kind of seasickness which I only over-

come by stretching out my leg until Itouched

with my foot the knee of my father who sat

opposite me. (P. 31)
The sense of touch, unlike sight, hearing, smell,
does not depend upon the media of space to commu-
nicate itself. It is not a spatial relationship, it is
two surfaces coming into direct contact with one
another, an encounter. Brigge, by means of this
simple gesture, has re-established his surface. His
balance, his will, his consciousness, his desire, his
defences have returned. The adult Brigge undergoes
a similarly shattering experience when he witnesses
a grieving woman who seems to have torn her face
off, broken her surtface. He shudders at the "naked
flayed head without a face." (P. 16) But it is the
emptiness of the defenceless head thathe cannot hear.
Why is nothingness so unbearable to Brigge?

It is my contention that Brigge must conceive non-
Being before he can experience Being. Two passages
in the book make this contention inevitable. On page
14 we find two paragraphs which depend on tension
for their coherence. The first paragraph describes
Brigge’s agony as he lies in bed, bombarded with
noise from his open Window. The noises are chaotic,
unconnected, brutally personified, and seem to have
an existence all their own apart from their sources.
The startling paragraph that follows begins:

These are the noises. But there is something

here that is more terrible: the stillness.
Can stillness and sound possibly be described except
in terms of one another? This is, it seems to me,
the reply in the latter paragraph. What is sound but
a punctuation of silence? After all, silence is neces-
sary, that is to say, it is a continuous existant,
whereas sound is a contingency, an accidental interr
ruption of stillness. Whatever we perceive of sound
must always depend to some extent on the stillness
before and after the sound; loudness varies according
to the degree of silence that has been displaced, and
upon the distance the soundmusttravelthrough still-
ness before it reaches the ear. Unfortunately Erigge
is not yet prepared to face silence, nothing-ness, itself
at this point, The second passage that Ihave in mind

is on page 25, in which Briggs describes two scenes
in totally different Ways. The first is a view of the
streets of Paris in the early morning. The depth that
this description attains is only asperfectas that in a
painting: Brigge could be describing to us a huge
mural, since “everything related to expanse--the
river, the bridges, the long streets, and the squares
that squander themselves--has taken that expansein
behind itself, is painted on it as on silk.” There is
no room in his description for anything that cannot
be contained, framed, ”broughtintoa few right, clear
planes". Brigge here is looking at something, he is
mere spectator and has no implied relationship to
what he is seeing, It is anvovdimensionalscene. But
the following paragraph is a description ofa three-
dimensional experience, a composition in, which

Brigge is an integral part. It is an aggregate of
relationships, in which the space between andaround
the objects is as important as the objects them-
selves. "In the street below", it begins, and imme-
diately Brigge becomes a part of the composition,
since its location in space has been defined in terms
of himself. Looking into (rather than at) the scene,
Brigge’s description takes on a new spatiality.
Prepositional phrases hold the scene together:
”. . . on the front of it lengthwise . . . Behind
that, crossways . . . up towards. . ." And his "third
person” is already hinted at, since the whole scene
is moving down the street even as he describes it.
Motion is, after all, a direct function of spatial
relationships~an activity which takes a body from
one point in space to another. This is an experience
in the true sense of the word; Briggeis a part of his
perception and his perception is a part of him. in
this sense, his surface has been broken; he hasa
window on reality, an “out-look".

We know that the rest of the book is going to deal
with Brigge's expanded experience and how he utit
lises the compositional principle. His art will no
longer be like his experience-tit will be his exper-
ience.

is it possible that despite discoveries and
progress, despite culture, religion, and world-
wisdom, one has remained on the surface of
life? Is it possible that one has even covered
this surface. which might Stillhavebeen some
thing, with an incredibly uninteresting stuff
which makes it look like the drawingnroom
furniture during summer holidays? Is it
possible to believe one could have a Godwitht
out using him? (Pp. 28, 30)
"God" here is the compositional principle in all
things.
