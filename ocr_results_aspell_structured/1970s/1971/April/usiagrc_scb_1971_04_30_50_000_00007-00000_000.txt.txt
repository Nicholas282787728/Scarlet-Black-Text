Peoples’l‘Trenty Goes To Town

Today, tomorrow, Monday,
and Tuesday signatures for
the Peoples' Peace’l‘reatywill
be solicited by forty students
and a number of townspeople
in downtown Grinnell. The vol»
unteers will man three tables
in the downtown area, '

In addition to the signature
campaign, several other acti-
vities are planned. Today State
Representative Art Small jr.
(Dem.-Iowa City) will be in
Grinnell to speak about his
reasons for introducing legis-
lation in the Iowa House of
Represenmtives ,calling for
withdrawal from Vietnam.
Rep. Small will be at the

Seminary Talk

(continued from page 4)

Discussion also turned to
roles for women in the min-
istry. The panel noted that
women serveas seminarytea-

‘chers, as religious counsels »

ors, and as college chaplains,
but that few. denominations are
willing to allow women inpar-
ishes.

“The prejudice is pathetic,"
said Ruhe. "Theyhada woman
minister on What's My Line
last year, which shows how
freakishly they‘re still re-
garded."

Spell suggested: ”There's
definitely a problem, but a lot
of younger people feel differ-
ently about it. lthink yousolve
the situation by just getting

into it. '
