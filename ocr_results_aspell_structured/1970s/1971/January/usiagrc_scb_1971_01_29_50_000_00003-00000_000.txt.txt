Senale Considers Killing Sell

Following the announcement
that the carop housing pro-
posal described in Iastweek’s
5&8 had been approved, the
Senate Tuesday night took up
the momentous question, to
whit, should the Senate selfr
destruct?

The argument ran that comr
mittees provide allthe student
government action. They do
the work and make many de-
cisions. Furthermore, since
the senators - either as a.
group or as individuals - have
little contact with the admin
istration, they do not even
serve as a communimtions
link. It was Ida Gudema who
finally said right out that the
Senate and the office of SGA
president should beabolished.
Committees would then take
over the job ofstudentgovern-
ment.

A number of objections were
raised at this point. Andy
Loewi defended the office of
the president because some
individual ought to have an
overall view ofwhat is happen-
ing in Campus politics. Earl-
ier, for similar reasons,
Loewi criticized Al Cohen's
proposal to create an SGA
vicerpresident. Loewi claim-
ed that havinga vicerpresid-
ent would not only lighten the
president's workload(cohen's
intention) but would also prod
bably leave the president less
knowledgeable and thus 1655
effective in decision-making.

President Glenn Leggett
will not be able to leave on
his scheduled trip in Feb-
.ruary as planned, due to the
health of his wife. The trip
has beenpostponedindefin—
itely; President ,,Leggett
hopesltorgo either next fall
or a year from now.

The Senate's existence was
defended on the grounds that
it must serve as a committee
watchdog and as a focal point
for student opinion. Counter—
ing this came the suggestion
that the AWS- CHP Board could
fill such a role. House presi-

dents wouId talé a political
as well as residential respon-
sibility. Their positions in the
halls wouldpresumably insure
sensitivity to student opinion.
The provocative discussion
is to be Continued at next
week's Senate meeting.

Uncle Sam’s Club Asks For Volunteers

Uncle Sam's Club provides
activities for Children and
youth from four years old
through high school age. Any
Grinnell child is welcome at
Uncle Sam’s Club and no ch-
arge is made for use of the
facilities or participation in
the activities. The club house
is located on the corner of
Third Avenue and Pearl St’
reet. Over 400 young people
a year are regular members
of Uncle Sam's Club.

Uncle Sam'b Club depends on
Grinnell College students to

help supervise the club’s ac-
tivities after school and in the
evenings. The club particular-
ly needs help this semester
because the director, Mrs.
Thomazin, was very ill over
Christmas and is not yet up
to handling all the kids by
herself.

If you would like to lend a
hand and help Town- Gown re-
lations atthe same time, check
in your mailboxes {or a slg‘rr
up sheet. If you didn’t get one
or if you have any questions,
Call Johanna Ward at ext. 301.

library Joins Teletype System

On January 25 the Grinnell
College Libraryand four other
academic libraries joined the
Iowa Library Information
Teletype Exchange (In LITE),
a system supervised by the
Iowa State Traveling Library.
Its purpose is to liberalize
and simplify inter-library
loans among members. Each
day a "loop" of requests will
travel around the academic
teletype network with each
library sending the books it
has and adding its own re
quests.

Any student or faculty mem-
ber may request books not
available at Grinnell through
I- LITE.~ Towdo so, onenhouldl

crecy is the result of the St'

formation is power. If the
people have little information
about what the government is
doing, there is small chance
that they will challenge it.”

To implement the use ofprov
fessional economicanalysis in
government, Haveman called
for the creation of an office of
professional economists whv
ere Congressmen could obtain
objective data. “There are at
least a few Senators whocould
use such an office because -
