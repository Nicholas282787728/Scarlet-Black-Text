Coach Pfitsch has been the
coordinator and prime mover
of the new Complex during the
past few years. During an
S E: B interview, he expressed
an almost unbridled enthusia-
sm for the Complex and the
philosophy behind it. A staunch
advocate of multi-purpose ia-
cilities, Coach Pfitsch was
lavish with his praise of both
the building and thearchitects
who designed it. Not onl doe_s

GRINNELL TRAVEL CEN-
TER , Let us tell you where
to go.

Apartment for rent for sum-
mer. 1027 Broad, one block
from campus. Nice place for
three people, total rent $55,
will negotiate. Bob Pegram,

the building have a ”hell of
‘a lot of space," butwhat there
is is useful for a number of
different activities. In this
way there is no chance the
building will soon be out of

or too small. Solid con-
struciipn, good materials and
ingenuity of planning, he feels,

. will prove the decision to in-

vest stich a large sum to be
worth it in y'ea'rs to come.

With the problem of‘building
the Complex nearly over, Pfit-
sch sees the next problem as
being the integration of the
Complexginto Grinnell life. In
spite of the naturalattractive-
ness of the facility, its sheer
immensity will be bewilder
ing at first. Considering nat—
ural tendencies to be over-
awed by size. Pfitsch tenta—
tively plans to introduce the
Complex to the community by
a series of Complex-warming
parties. If the finishingtouch-
es an be completed before
New Student Days (and all
indications are that they tan),
entering freshmen will not un-
likely be greeted by a series
of tours and athletic exhibi-
tions, liberally interspersed
with parties, foodand dancing.
An “open house"wil1then fol-
low, with similar activities
for upperclassmen. Groups of
two or three individual halls
will then be invited to partake
of the facilities in a festive,
informal atmosphere. Event~
ually, everyone will have had
his or her turn togetacquain-
ted with the new building and
to have a good time.

Pfitsch plans to continue this
spirit of informal recreation
into a new recreational and
athletic policy stressingcam—
puswlde participation in in~
formal, self—actualized fun.

~ The Phy. Ed. Department-com -

ceptualized the Complex as a
method of making individual
and group recreation a deeper

part of the Grinnell Exper‘
ience.

Requirements are becoming
a thing of the past at Grinnell.
in their place is an amazingly
progressive effort to make
Education a personalized,
self-mutivated activity. Per-
haps in the foreground of this
experiment is the Phy. Ed.
Complex. Its philosophy is to
try to attract students to the
joys of group and individual
recreation by offering a vast
array of facilities where they
may go to develop old skills
and to discover new ones. By

the application ofdynumiclea-
dership and infectious enthut
siasm the Coaches hope to
foster a Summerhlllian ali’
mosphere where students can
learn to appreciate recrear
tion as fun rather than as a
chore.

It is strange that Grinnell
should approach selfeactual-
ized education through its
Physical Education Depart
ment. Perhaps it has in mind
the tEnets of the social psy-
chologist: let the body lead
and the mind will follow.

No Pels In Co ops

eted by the college.

President Leggctt met with
the committee to explain why
he vetoed the recommendation
that corops be allowed tohave
pets (on the unanimousappro-
val of co-op members.

He stated thatthe college was
responsible for the health con-
ditions of the buildings and
that pets are potential health
hazards. He was also con-
cerned about the pressures
that might be placed on stud‘
ents who did not want pets in
the co ops. 2-. _

The committee voted to sup:
port Leggett’ 5 position by a
6-2 count, reversing their
earlier vote.

be permitted during the first
two weeks of classes, provid
ing there is room available in
the tutorial to which the stud-
ent wishes to change. HOWV

a widely advertised practice,
and advisers and tutors should
not encourage switching for
other than serious consider-
ations or circumstances.

Course Offerings Revised

(continued from page 3)
Non majors who take these
courses will meet, probably
once a week, with a regular
four credit classics class.
McKibben believes this ar-
rangement will be beneficial
to students who are interest—
ed in classics courses, but do
not want to read material in
Latin and Greekuand it will
also be helpful to the majors,
by providing new' ideas and

viewpoints in discussions.
German: The biggest change

in the German curriculum will
be a course on 20th Century
German literature in trans'
lation. it will be open to Studt
ents with no previous German

training and will deal with‘

contemporary German prose,
poetry and drama;

Mathematics: Math 122 (In-
tro to Math 11) is being dr-
Upped and Math 121 (Intro 1)
will be offered both semes-
ters because Math 127 (a re-
latively new course, “Ca1-
culus, Probability, and Slat-
istics 1) now covers the mats
erial in 122. Thejother lower
level change is the addition of
Math 134, a one—credit com-
puter programming workshop
offered in conjunction with
Calculus 11 and available only
on a credit-fail basis.

At the upper levels, the jun‘
ior analysis course (3417342)
is being dropped and the cur-
rent senior algébra course
(4217422) will become the
standard junior course. The
analysis course will be re
placed with a new senior level
sequence, “Topology” (431)
and Analysis" (432).

Physical education: Some of
the most exciting curriculum
changes for next year will be
occuring in the physical edu~
cation department. A wide
variety of new P.E. activities
classes will be offered rang
ing from handball and squash

to skin diving.
The expanded and more di~

versified course offerings wh-
ich are planned are centered
largely around the new physi'
cal education complex. Court
ses in self-defense sports—-
karate and judoen, elemen-
tary diving, gymnastics ap-
paratus, synchronized swim-
ming, free exercise, trampoe
line, officiating, andthe treat-
ment of injuries will also be
offered.

One of the most interesting
of the new Phys—Ed activity
courses is one on.specnating
team sports. The course will
be designed for thoseinterCS'
ted in learning to appreciate
the major spectator team
sports .1 baseball, football,
soccer and basketball.

Pfitch saidthatinsomeareas
a problem of getting person-
nel with the necessary exper
tise exists, and an increasing
number of students will be
used in these areas.

Another new area which is
currently being debated wid-r
in the department is the estabt
lishment of various sports
clubs. A karate club or a
gymnastics club would pro
mote continuity within the
sport and encourage mutual
assistance toward improve-
ment. Participants could
more easily advance from one
level ofproficiency toanother.

Dunlorilr Receives NSF Granl

A $19, 500 National Science
Foundation grant to Grinnell
College will extend for two‘
years a research project be-
ing conducted by Joseph D.
Danforth, Dack professor of
chemistry. .

The grant, effective for a
two-year period which began
May 1, will finance mnforth's
study of "Kinetics and Chem‘
istry of the Decompositions
of Solids." He has been doing
work in this area the last two
years under an $11,000 NSF
stipend.

Included in Danforth‘ 5 study
during the upcomingtwoyears
will be an investigation of
plastic used on the nose cones
of retentry rockets. He also
plans to survey gasketmatere

ials used in high* temperature
atmospheres and the mechan- ,
ics by which the materials
decompose.

laura David, a freshman
from Creve Coeur, Mo., will
serve as a student research
assistant to the Grinnell che~
mist this summer and during
the 1971~72 amdemic year.
This is the fourth national
Science Foundation research
grant for Dr. Danforth, who
has been a member ofthe col‘
lege's faculty since 1947. He
initiated Grinnell’s program
of government-supported re-
search in 1948, and since that
time the college has received
numerous federal grants for
bath faculty and student pro-
jects.

Preps To Attend Workshops

(continued from page 4)
and projects either within or
outside the "academic" st-
ructure. We are [hoping to get
people together in small
groups to discuss the philos~
ophy of education in the broad-
er sense, and thou to explore
a specific way in which an
individual or group has used
his (its) initiative to open
channels in the educational
process. This is not to prer
clude the possibility of some-
one who has done interesting
work within a course struc-
ture from presenting a sem‘
inar. Tentative seminar topics
include LEAP,: alternative
media, the cold war, the Oil-
tural Revolutionl in China and
a program by Rilssian House.

Sunday morning there will
be another lightlbreakfasi in
the dorms. We will be invit-
ing faculty,administratlonand
their families. We hope the
new students will be well“
acquainted with 'the total col-
lege community, even before
classes begin. Mr. Haas is
planning a chapel service for
l

11:00 A.M. Sunday afternoon
will be pre-registration for
new students with a possible
option of continuing the sem-
inars from the previous day.
The all‘ campus picnic will be
Sunday evening, and the Folk
Dancers are planning a pro-
gram.

We hope to present a well~
balanced and integrated in-
troduction to Grinnell. Above
all, we want to make the new
students feel welcome. We
hope upperclassmen will be
available at all times to help
the new students With any
questions they may have, and
we will have an information
bomb on Central Campus or
in the Forum.

Senior Gill

The Senior Committee an-
nounced that 160 members of
the class of ’71 have contri‘
buted $1,450 to the senior
class gift. The gift, designa-
ted for purchasing library
books, will be presented to
President Leggett at the Sen-
ior Class Dinner.
