Soccer - Near Win

by Luigi Schwartz

The Grinneil soccerteam wasdealt
its third loss of the season lastsat-
urday. Knox college wasthe opposing
team. This was the second loss ofthe
season to the Siwashers.

The game was close, as the 2-1
score indicates. The iirst goal came
about half way through the second
half as a Knox forward dribbled the
ball past the Grinneii goalie. The
score stayed 1-0 for the remainder
of the hall,

Throughout the second half the
teams fought an even battle. The
deienses dominated the game until
about threeefourths of the way
through the half. At this time Steve
Korstaad broke loose Onatastbreak
to score his ninth goal oi the year.
With the score lied and fiveminutes
remaining in the game, Knox scored
the final goal on a direct kick,

This coming Saturday the Pioneer
kickers will meet Cornell. Grinnell
beat Cornell earlier inthe season so
both teams will consider this an im-
portant game.
