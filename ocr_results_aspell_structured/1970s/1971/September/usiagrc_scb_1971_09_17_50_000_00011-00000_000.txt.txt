Correspondenu:

by Curt Gorrell

Based upon excerpts drawn
from a lengthy personal inter-
view, this week’s column is
designed to acquaint Grinnell
College students with a public
representative of the state of
Iowa. This, an introduction to
United States Senator Jack
Miller, presents those of his
views which the author has
considered to be relevant to
the interests ofGrinnell's 5w.
dent body.

Vietnam

in biographical material
released by Senator Miller‘s
office staff, his stance on the
Vietnam War situation is de-
fined as support for “Presie
dent Nixon's policy of ‘Vietnae
mization’ as better than the
extremes of all out war or
immediate withdrawal."Elab-
crating upon the basis for his
position, the Senator stated
that, ”There has been a basic
objective...that has been re-
peatedly stated over the years
...and that was that South Vi-
etnam should have its chance
to live its own life - to have
freedom ofselfdetermination
in accordance with a cardinal
principle of the United Nae
tion’s Charter."

With the opportunity to ex-
press their self-determiner
tion approaching the Vietna-
mese people in their current
upcoming choice of “Thieu”
or “NOeThieu”, Senator Mil—
ler expressed disappointment
"in the way things shapedup."
Although he deems as encoure
aging Thieu's recent State'
ment that if he will resign if
he received less than one-half
of the votes, the Senator also
believes that it is important
to speak of what percentage
of the vote should actually
turn out:

"Suppose he (Thieu) might
say, 'well, if 60% of the eli~
gible voters go to the polls
and I don’t get half of that
vote, I'm going to resign',
that would be a little more
meaningful to me..."

When seeking comment a-
bout recent congressional at‘
tempts to shorten the war, I
was reminded by Senator Mil-
ler that, “Some people think
in terms of American With’
drawal - well, that doesn‘t
necessarily end the war. We
could withdraw our troops [0*
marrow, and that war could
go on for 50 years - I don't
think it would , but the point
I make, if you want to settle
the killing..the best way to do
it is by negotiations."

Miller places a high prer
mium upon negotiations, bee
lieving that they could be "...
the most longrlasting way to
settle this thing.’ His own
outlook is that ' settinga fixed
date is something that would
kill off the possibility of end—
ing this whole thing by nego-
tiations...and I frankly think
that the pendency and all the
debate on these fixed date
resolutions may well have de-
terred North Vietnam from
getting into serious negotia-
tions."

Draft and Volunteer Army

Changing from the topic of
military service involvement
to military service organiza-
tion, Senator Millerdiscussed
the feasibility ofa plan to red
place the process of the draft
with an allrvolunteer army.

In the Senator's words,
“The hard, cold facts of mil-
itary life are that during 1972
and 1973 there are hundreds
of thousands of men whose

military obligations will cease -

and they will be coming out of
of cutbacks in U.S. military

1:).

force levels many of these
men will need to be replaced.

Also, it is recognized that
many of the men who current-
ly volunteer for service do so
only under the pressure ofthe
draft. "If you take the draft
law off the books,we have been
told by plenty ofwitnesses who
are knowledgeable, there area
great many people who would
never think ofvolunteeringfor
the armed forces."

Thus Senator Miller, ale
though he supports the con-
cept ofa volunteer army, he—
lieves that a transition to the
reality cannot occur over-
night. People would be well
advised not to “...jump the gun
on it, because if they jump the
gun and the thing fails, then
the chances of having an allr
volunteer force, I’m afraid,
are almost irrevocably rue
ined."

Demonstrations

Seeking to determine the
effect that various demonstrar
tions, marches, etc., would
have upon a UnitedStatcs Sen~
ator , one man these tactics
are designed to influence, I
was cautioned by Senator Mile
ler that one cannot simply gen-
eralize "demonstrations".
However, his basic response
was: ”...Violent demonstra-
tions , forget them
more harm than good...”
ereas, "...peaceful demon-
strations, and I’m talking av
bout peaceful in the bestsense
of the term, an be helpful if
they are united."

Miller cited public opinion
as an important guide for
policy-makers, and said "If
the demonstration offends
public opinion I don't thinkit's
going to be effective in getting
policy-makers to do what the
demonstrators hope to do."

"When I'm a dissenter...
when I vote yes for something
and I know it's good, and I'm
defeated, I'm frustrated. Be-
lieve me I know what it is for
a dissenter to feel frustrar
tions. But what do I do - go
sulk in my tent and say 'Well,
the stupid idiots, they should
have passed my bill'? No. I
keep working at it, and Iwill
continue to keep working at
it. So I think you have to be
patient, I think you have to be
optimistic, and...it's not going
to help you any to say, ‘Oh,
they're a bunch of silly “in,
compoops‘. I have lived with
these frustrations...and yet I
am optimistic."

Youth Vote

With the new minimum
voting age the politicalavenue
has been widened to accomo-
date and channel the energy of
youth into politics. Senator
Miller visualizes the impact
of the youth v0te and the den
gree of youth involvement in
politics as a ”T‘worway strr
eet". Not only is it important
for the young people to exert
themselves, butalso for“sen-
ior party members" to take
“some initiative to get with
the young folks so you can
have a sharing of ideas..."

Miller himself Is very
much concerned with young
people, (“If I had my druthers
I’d like to do nothing for six-
ty days except move around
and rap with the people on the
campuses...“), and it was in
our discussion about youth,
about the hopes and ideals of
young people and about their
discouragement, that the Sens
ator was most openly moved
and deeply involved in the in
deas he projected.

“Most of the young folks
are idealists. Most of us here
in Congress are idealists too ,
but what's the difference? Qir

‘Senh‘iorﬁﬂiller Speaks To $8.3"

idealism, based upon having
gone through the throes , after
all we were all young folks
once too — our idealism has
been leavened with realism.
You don't get realism just by
reading a book - you get re-
alism through the hardknocks
of experience."

“the thing that does hoe
ther me is the fact that there
are a few politicians who, so
to speak, lead the young folks
down a primrose path, using
their - abusingtheiridealism
, getting their hopes up in the
clouds and knowing better,
knowing that they’re not going
to end up in the clouds , they'—
re going to end up on a lower
plateau or maybe not ending
up at all , and then the next
thing you know you have a
lot of our young idealists who
are frustrated and disappoin-
ted and it may take years for
them to come out of that."

”How much better itwould
have been, instead of leading
them down a primrose path,
to point out that the path is
pretty prickly, and to give
them some guidance basedup—
on experience. And then your
idealism is going to come thr-
ough. It may not come through
as fast as some people would
like, but it’ll come through...
and it's very, very important
to the future of this country."

You may or may not hold
or support the same goalsand
policies as Senator Jack Mil-
ler; take his words with as
many grains of salt as you
deem necessary. But in my
own final assessment Ifound
the man bOIi‘l forthright and
sincere, and Iain reminded
that agreement is not necesr
sarily a prerequisite to rash
pect.

City Music --

by Bill Thomas

During the last summer I
lived in the Black Ghetto of
St. Louis. That had a lot of
disadvantages in itself: and
my white skin didn’t make ita
lot easier (my hair was Inns
enough that my whiteness did-
n't help much with thepolice).
Many good things for me did
come out ofliving there, much
new awareness.

One of the best things was
that I got to hear a group of
black musicians play real
music for their Brothers and
Sisters. Do you know what I
mean? They played what peo-
ple seem to call avani-garde
jazz. Now, I heard Cecil Tay-
101' when he was here, but I
discovered a vast difference
between listening to a group
of black musicians play for a
mostly white audience in R07
berts Theater; between that
and walking into an old build-
ing (tavern on one side, burnt-
out house on the other) with
the smell of good barbecue in
the air, knowing enough of the
people there to not feel too
uncomfortable about being
white, sitting down in an old
chair and listening.

They were members of the
Black Artist Guild, which is
like the AACM in Chicago.
The leader was a poet named
Ajule’ of the Shadows. Two
brothers, twins, as a matter
of fact, had fixed up the place
where they were playing; they
sold sandwiches, soda, fruit
juice, used books things like
that. They didn’t have enough
money to pay musicians, but
there were often people play-
ing there.

The music began with all the
instruments playing soft and
muted, no solos or fancy riffs,
jus t a soft layer of musical

Initiative Fund’s New look

by Chip Shofstall

The Joint Board this year approved a plan by George Shybut,
Finance Committee Chairman, to consolidate the Speaker's
Fund and the Initiative Fund. The consolidated committee
became officially known as the Initiative- Cultural Fund Com-

mittee.
The Joint Board approved the allocation of $4,000 to the

InitiativeeCultural Fund and requested that the Committee
recommend guidelines for doling out the money. ,

Besides providing some necessary historical perspective
on the development of the Initiative- Cultural Fund, the main
thrust of this article is directed at you, the students of
Grinneli College. This money has been set aside bythe
joint Board to finance events which are studenteinitiated.
Each and every student is encouraged to at least think about
some original way to spend some of this money. Very broadly
the money is available for any cultural event which may be
said “to contribute to the further enlightenment and/or
refinement of campus opportunities." Such functions as spe-
eches, lectures, films, symposia, discussions and poetry
readings are eligible for funding.

This is the first time that money has been allocated es—
pecially for the funding of Smdentrsponsored cultural events.
Everyone has either heard some fantastic speaker or poet,
or seen some great film. Thus, in a sense, we are attempting
to tap that great resource of ideas that the student body
collectively holds.

The committee also has the necessary latitude to finance
social events which are not of a private nature. Hopefully,
some all~campus social events will be initiated; the money
is available, the initiative is needed.

Although the committee especially encourages the develop-
ment of cultural activities whidi can benefit the entire
student body, it will in certain cases fund student groups
wishing to participate in cultural activities outside of Grin-
nell.

All students and student groups are encouraged to apply
to the committee. Student groups may be either official or
unofficial, "e.g." a group of friends who have a good idea.
The fund has the potential to provide a much broadened
array of campus cultural events; however, the burden is on
the intellectual and imaginative initiative of each and every
Grinnell student.

A Confusion 0f Metaphors

sound. The music was strange
enough to me that I began to
perceive it in metaphors. I
began to think that the music
sounded like a flowingstream,
but that didn't fit, soIthought:
a stream of honey, no, amud-
dy stream, a blue stream, a
flow of stones instead of
water? I was still trying to
fit the feel of the music with
familiar (though by now pres
try surreal) images,when sud-
denly a change happened and
the sound became hard and
clear, and I thought, ”Ah,now
it's like a hot stream, like a
stream that would flow off a
mountain ready to erupt intoa
volcano" but that didn't work
any better, and the music con-
tinued to go through changes,
dragging me with it -- me
struggling to align the stra-
nge sounds with my meta-
phors.

Then something a friend had
once said came to me, about
modern jazz being the music
of the city, of the black per
son in the city. I think Ire-
member leaning back then,
and I know I felt almost a
physical ~relief. Now I star-
ted hearing things in terms
of old mr engines and smoky
buses, concrete, bricks, and
painted wood, neon lights and
parking lots that glitter beaur
tifully in the sticky heat of
the day from an even coating
of broken glass. I now was
following the musicmore eas
ily, choosing my images from
the urban, artificial, constr-
ucted landscape, rather than
from the countryside. I was
still having some trouble; as
fter all, I had only been liv-
ing in the city for twomonths.

September 24, 1971

I was listening, thinking a-
bout how the music was me-
chanical rather than organic,
when the musicians began to
really get into one part of
the number. As they played, a
picture began to form in my
mind .. I mean the picture
actually formed right there,
not later, in leisurely reflec—
tion, but right then, in the
energy of the performance. I
first started seeing weeds
growing in the cracks ofside»
walks, then I saw the scrubby
bushes growing among the
garbage and trash in the air
leys, and then Isaw —— there
is this kind of tree, the‘lo-
cust tree, that springs up fast
and can be found in scraggly
condition in abandoned or un-
tended areas ofa city, break-
ing up cement and pushing a-
gainst old buildings ,, Is'aw
a locust tree growing in a
frame of concrete, crumbling
and breaking the concrete,and
forming a new, organicorder.
The music, the jazz, in which
I had been unable to perceive
an order now seemed to be
the vision of these artists
of a different order, affected
and shaped, like the locust
tree, by the struggle with
the mechanical and limited
rationalism, but in nature,
organic.

Now, when I struggle with
people who don't see my hopes,
or who like the mechanistic
Order (which I see as stif-
ling). or who hi some way
seem to me as the concrete
to the living tree, that music
actually helps me out. I see
the change as the necessary,
and can also see it now as
the tree.

For me, this article was
about radio stations.
