Approve KDICr-«Budgei

by Don Dagenais

In a short, efficient meeting

last Monday night the Joint
Board took major steps on
three fronts by unfreezingand
approving the radio station
budget, approving Initiative
Fund guidelines, and appro-
ving a plan for giving off
campus students Joint Board
representation.

The matter of the radio sta-
tion was the first order of
business. SGA President Shel~
ley Floyd opened the discus
sion by reading a Statement
from the Publications Come
mittee requesting that the Bo-
ard approve a $300 level for
all KDIC salaries.

Student Coordinator BobMe-
yer informed the board that
he had taken the KDIC inven-
tory list down to Grinnell
station KGRN in order tohave
it checked out. The KGRN
man saw only one minorprobr
lem with the list, he repor-
ted, and that concerned the
necessity of buying an extra
[WO’ cartridge tape deck which
KDIC has plans to purchase.

Chief Engineer Bob Sparks
defended the purchase of the
tape deck, and lectured the
Board and Meyer on ”my
nOt having been informed"
of this action. "KGRN is our
only direct competition," he
noted, and added that he felt
"my integrity is in doubti"

Phil Sasich, in reply to Spa-
rks, said that the budget-
f-reezing action “was not an
attack," and that no KDIC
staff members should take it
personally. Nonetheless Star
tion Manager Clay Leeargued
that the station was ”dealt a
low blow" by being restricted
in budgetary matters, and that
the Board "undermines its
credibility" by taking such
actions.

Charges and counter‘cha-
rges flew back and forth for
a few minutes until Shelley
decided to end debate. Nor-
ris Hall president Sam Cle-
mons inserted a last obser-
vation that “it‘s a wonder
these guys can operate such
an efficient station on such a
limited budget." Withthat Loe
ren Hart moved to unfreeze
the station funds and approve
the KDIC budget as recom-
mended by the Finance Come
mittee. The Board quickly did
so, and the matter oithe radio
swtion came to an end at
last, with a final apology from
Shelley for ”any ill will that
was interpreted."

Chip Shofstall presented to
the Board a policy statement
from his Initiative-Cultural
Fund Committee for debate
and approval. The Committee
has received “lors of appli-
mtions for funds" for various
types of projects, he noted,
but "the thrust of it is cul~
tural. Hopefully people will
be able to use their own ima-
gination and initiative."

The philosophy behind the
Initiative Fund, according to
the statement, is “to provide
the greatest service to the
greatest number ofstudents.”
Accordingly, private parties
will nOt be funded, Chip said.
Furthermore there will be
enough appgcations to use up

all the Initiative Rind money,
therefore no money will be
available for hall functions.
With little debate the guide
lines were approved.

With its last order of hu-
siness, the Joint Board faced
up to a major weakness in
its own structure, i.e. that
offrcampus students have no
SCA representation. AWS
President Kathy Ellis reporr
ted that there are presently
47 students living in co-op
houses (3.8% 03$ student
body), 53 students living in
project houses and ParkStrer
et residences (4.2% of the
students) and 112 students livr
ing in nontcollege owned hou-
sing (8.4% of the students).
She recommended that the
coop and project houses be
given one Joint Board repret
Sentative apiece, and the off-
campus residents in none
college owned housing be gi-
ven two representatives. The
motion passed with little dis-
cussion.

A Grinnell Fraternity?

Grinnell's first and only frar
ternity was formed this week.
Basing its philosophy on the
pursuit ofhappiness, the group
is dedicated to the proposi‘
tion that al' members are to

be intoxicated equally.

Whizzing by with his bookcart, Tom McBee rushes fresh

supplies to the shelves.

McBee Begins Second Year

by David Walker

Last year, in the fall of
1970, Grinnell students re
turned to find a new bookstore
open on campus. For those of
us who remembered the old
basement bookstore with its
sky-high shelves, thin aisles,
and poor selection of books,
the new bookstore, With more
than twice the floorspace,was
an exhilarating improvement.
Here was space to display the
newest books, records, jour-
nals, and posters. The class -
room supplies were removed
from the area of book dis-
play. The lighting was ader
quate. And the biggest plus
was the new bookstore mar
nager, Tom McBee.

Tom, who has worked for
bookstores and companies in
Montana, Washington, Oregon,
and Iowa, has now been at

Ogle’s Chips Win Wolerbed In

by Sue Lindsey

A truly exciting event took
place in Loose Hall on Sa-
turday, September 18. The
South Campus Cookie Contest,
sponsored by Cal Emery, was
judged in room 610. Kathy
Ogle’s prizewinning chocolate
chip cookies were chosen on
the basis of quality, quantity,
and originality, andKathy wal~
ked off with the prize, a 6
foot by 7 feet waterbed.

According to the sponsor,
Cal Emery, it all begn with
the waterbed. Living on first
floor, he could not keep his
fantastic bed. After he dis-
cussed the problem with Fran
Cutler, they mme up with the
idea of making the bed the
prize in a contest; more spe-
cifically, a cookie-baking con—
test. With a couple of flares
and a let of imagination, they
began to publicize the ups
coming event. Becausewater-
beds are banned from upper
floors, it seemed obvious that
only people living in pits on
uld bother to enter. So this
was not made a part of the
rules. A dozen cookies had to
be entered by September 17
to be eligible.

The judging was done by six
obviously welltqualifiedyoung
people: Peter Horowitz, Judy
Markewich, Fran Qitler, Pe-
ter Van Oilin, Jeff Robinson,
and Cal Emery. Each judge
cast a vote for two different

batches of cookies, and the
baker of the cookies receiving
the most votes won the water»
bed for the rest of the semesr
ter.

The winning chocolate chip
cookies by Kathy Ogle outdid
Peter West's cookies that
“lookied like pretzelsand tas-
ted like animal crackers"
were first runners-up. A tie
for second runner-up resulted
between Bruce Bonnewell‘s
magic "gooey bars"andMarr
jorie Daly's old- fashioned su-
gr cookies. According to Cal,
it was a tough decision.

In a recent interview, Miss
Ogle smted that she has been
a cookie baker from wayback.
Her cookie career at Grinnell
began about three years ago
when Dr. Crossett gave his
famous lecture on virginity
to Dibble and Main Halls.
Cookies were needed on that
occasion and for the party the
next Saturday. Kathy ended up
with the job of baking 1,000
chocolate chip cookies. (Are
you paying a :.ition, SAGA?)
Since then her cookie career
has included such things as
baking cookies for the football
team and all of her friends.

Grinnell for a year. It was a
year, he says, for setting upa
new store and accumulating
information about the services
a bookstore can make avait
lable. In this new year he
hopes to hear a lot more
from people at Grinnell on
their interests in subjectsand
authors. Last year, for the
first time there was an em-
phasis on books not in the
course lists. Brautigan, Ar
delle Davis, Fuller, Hesse,
The Whole Earth Catalogue,
architectural series, garde-
ning and farming guides, and
other books found nowhere
else in Iowa were on the
shelves. There are catalogues
of hardback and paperback
books publishedvery recently;
individual orders may be
placed.

Cookie Contest

By special request,Miss Og—
le, South Campus Cookie
Queen, has consented to give
this newspaper her prizewinr
ning recipe which is, by the
way, original with her.

Ogle's Chocolate
Chip Cookies
I c. butter
1 c. dark brown sugar
1/2 (2. white sugar
2 eggs
1-1/2 tsp. vanilla
1 tsp. salt
1 tsp. soda
2-1/3 c. flour
2 c. chocolate chips
1 c. chopped nuts
Cream together butter and
sugar until light. Beatineggs,
vanilla, salt and soda. Add
ﬂour, then add chips andnuts.
Bake at 350 degrees for 8
to 10 minutes, being careful
not to overcook.

Ironically enough, Kathy catr
not use the bed. When asked
why she entered the contest,
she replied, "When I saw
the announcement, I couldn't
resist the challenge."

Deciphor SAGA

Usually a joke remains a
joke, but not in the case of
the south campus ”What does
Saga stand for?" contest held
the past two weeks.

Sophomore John Davis was
the lucky winner with his Sap
definition of, ”Suicide At»
tempts Gone Awry." He col~
lected his free dinner at Arh~
vano's (a medium size ancho-
vie and sausage pizza) the
same night he was announced
the winner.

Originally, the contest was
just a joke to see what peo-
ple would write down. Later,
two friends of the originator
convinced him to reallyaward
the stated prize because the
entries were getting so good.

Davis brushed off the award
lightly saying, “I won because
I put down my hall floor and
room number. But you have
to admit it was an impartial
contest because hardly any-
one put their names down,
just hall and floor numbers."

Incidentally, Saga actually
comes from the last four let~
ters of an Indian word which
the food service took for its
name when it smrted inNew

York.

According to SAGA
Jerry, the name which they
originally wanted for their fl-
eding business was the In»
dian name for Geneva~"Ka-
nadesaga."

Sire To Speak

Next Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday, Dr. James W. Sire
of the Inter- Varsity Press
will present a series of three
lectures in the South Lounge
on the subject of “Literature
as a Vision."

The 7:30 P.M. Thursday lec-
tures will focus on the philo-
sophical viewpoints of reality
found in we, 'by GigM. 1101):?
kins, Dylan homas,,and Fran
nz Kafka. Examples will be
drawn from a number of per
spectives, including Chris-
tian. pantheistic, materialis-
tic, and agnostic positions.
The lecture will endwitha de-
tailed look at the nihilistlc
perspective presented in the
short stories of Kafka.

The Friday lecture will beat
4:30 in the afternoon. Mr.
Sire will discuss two answers
to the nihilistic vision, found
in Hesse's “Siddhartha" and
J.R.R. Tolkien‘s "Leaf by
Niggle."

In the third lecture Saturday
evening at 7:30, Mr. Sire will
examine Saul Bellow’s “Mr.
Sammler’s Planet" and com-
pare the Christian views found
there with the more orthodox
views of John Updike and C.S.
Lewis.
