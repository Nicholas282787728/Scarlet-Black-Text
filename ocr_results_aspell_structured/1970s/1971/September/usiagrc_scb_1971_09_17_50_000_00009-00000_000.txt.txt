The Music Scene:Weallier Repor

by EiiiOtt Lewis

Since the conception ofWE/ir
THER REPORT, much has
been said about their music.
The individual members ofthe
group have made a lasting 1m,
pression on jazz listeners for
some time.

Many can connect names like
Joe Zawinul with Cannonball
Adderly, and Wayne Shorter
with Miles Davis; however,
the combination of giants like
Zasinul and Shorter, along
with an unbelievable bassist
like Miroslav Vitous, created
for music lovers a truly orir
ginal sound.

Weather Report’s first ai-
bum is only a sampling of the
wide horizons of sound in
store.

The opening track on the first
side, entitled "Milky Way,"
creates for the listener the
same effect as looking at ce-
lestial bodies from different
windows of a space craft. If
the stars couldsing they would
sound like the unique blend of

acoustic piano and light opera
sax.

“Umbrellas” is a story of
rain and the fury ofa storm.
Vitous’ electric basswithfuzz
attachment is a Streakofligh’
tning in the shower of sound.
Not to be omitted is the via
sual percussion of drummer
Alphonze Mouzon and percusr
sionist Airto Moreiro.

”Seventh Arrow" is a de-
vastating combination of son
prano sax, FeliderrRliodespir
ano, and the furious drum-
ming of Mouzon. The gene.
rated excitement brings to
mind some form of warfare.
The cutting edge of Shorter‘s
Sax is as potent as anyarrow.

Probably the most beautiful
cut on the album in "Orange
Lady." in a ”Downbeat“ ins
terview, Zawinul says he
wrote the song about his wife
and the sadness that living
in the city can bring. imcllow
inner movement with much
percussion represents a trip
to the country where Lhere is

710m 740m Ahead: Ulla 55m 70 le, 7W

by Barry Zigas

Aland is a small Finnish
island lying midway between
Sweden and Finland, Sixhours
seattime. Boats leave every
day from three competing
company quais. A long, slow
ride across the sea.

"I come here, no ilot too
often. Oh, maybe once a
month"--eldcrly lady trar
veiling with a friend.
Ski.‘ 20 for the passage and
overnight accommodations in
a private home.
”It's not usually so cheap.
We generally charge much
more. But, you know, very
few go just now. It‘s getting
cold."—-the travel agent.

Powerful twin diesels propel
the ZOO-foot long ship. Thread
it through the innumerableis-
lands and islets of the Stock
holm Archipelago. The shore~

happiness. The return to the
first part is the return trip
home, which, too, is sad, but
the percussion remains as a
memory ofa happy time.

"Orange Lady” ’5 melody
line is a fantastic combinar
tion of Shorter’s sax playing
and Vito‘s bowing his string
bass in a manner that has to
be heard to be believed.

Side two opens with a cut
entitled "Morning Lake." It‘s
all there. You can hear the
birds and insects and the sir
lence of the leaves on trees
glistening in the freshly*
dewed dawn. The electricpiat
no and electric bass (equipped
with wa-wa) create the sen-
sation of water moving and
tricking along in a secluded
forest.

Almost a sequel to "Morning
Lake" is ”Water Fall.”
Much of the same coloration
is used With the exception of
Shorter playing a stronger
melody line. Once again the

line is covered with cvcr-
greens and boulders. Summer
houses for Sweden's great
middle classnestlethere,em-
pty in early autumn.

After four hours we enter
the choppy, open sea. in two
months this bay will be frozen
over from shore to shore-7
siXty miles of salty ice. Gre'
at iccbreakers regularly keep
the shipping lanes open, but
the rest is all ice. You could
skate to Finland.

Jackpot

At cvcry doorway one is
assaulted by one-armed bon-
dits. Almost twenty of them
complement the ship, braced
in pairs or triplets, offering
a “fantastic” jackpot. None of
them is ever silent. As soon
as one anxious gambler fades
away, another sidles up and
claims the great, noisy box.

1 Opens New Horizons Of Sound

percussionist should be noted
for his inventiveness in inter-
preting nature and its beauty.

A semi-blase feel is estab
lished in ”Tears.” A slow,
deliberate melody is develor
ped and then accelerated into
an up tempo, funky, vamp.
Mouzon is credited with the
vocal howls that are moving in
the same vein as the title.
The voice adds a human feel
to their already graphic mu-
sic.

Closing out is a more tradi~
tional type jazz tune called
“Eurydice.” Apowerfulwalk-
ing bass line is set up by Vie
to and very fluid soprano sax
solos over Zawinul’s electric
keyboard. It should be added
that Zawinul also takes a nice
solo on this cut.

The music is new. But isn't
everything? As Zawinul puts
it‘, “The music is a sound
track for your head, and it's
all related to live." Listen
to some Weather Report.

They cost one krowna chance,
but if you‘ve been around and.
have foreign currencies about
you, Finnish SU penni pieces
((11er or Danish krowns(.70
kr.) will serve just as well.
During the whole twelve hours
no one hit the jackpot; most
people iaskedhad lost, somea
lot, most only a little bit.

Roulette
There‘s a roulette wheel on

board also. It‘s operatedmost
oi the trip, except when bingo
is on. The real action isatthe
restaurant, the bars, and the
duty* free shop. People smoke,
drink, and eat with graceless
abandon; tobacco and alcohol
are the priority items. Once
ashore, an army of Swedish
houseineS‘ror theirmothers
-- will invade the lomlsuperr
markets, snapping up meat
and meat products at a sub-
stantial savings. Everything
is cheaper in Finland, some-
times by as much as 60%. Q]
the ship and in Finland cig-
arettes cost half-ardollar for
a pack; in Sweden they are
nearly all over a dollar.
Temperance Movement

The Swedish government has
deliberately driven the prices
of tobacco and alcohol up.
With tobacco it is through
heavy taxes; in the case ofal-
cohol, anything stronger than
3.6% beer is sold by the gov»
ernment, and only by the gov-
ernment. From the mid- 30's
till 1956, as a result of a
compromise between a str-
ong, wellrfinanced temper»
ance movement and a gener—
ally hard- drinking population,
alcohol in Sweden was strict-
iy rationed.

in the early days lWentyrﬂve
was the minimum age and the
limit was two liters of wine
per month. The ration card
could be revoked by local
authority if sufficient proof
showed the person guilty of
abuse or generally poor mor—
al standing. In 1956, the gOV’

[HP Campaign: Support Your local Tree ‘

by Bill Knecht

Local Efﬂuents and Abate-
ment Procedures (LEAP) oft
fers these timely tips to help
you support your local tree.
Remember that ailpaper, in~
cluding the rag you are now
reading, was once a living,
breathing, oxygen-producing,
completely biodegradable
tree. It may seem a shame
to take a perfectly good tree
and mush it up to make news
print, but that’s the way it
goes. The world is a rough

place.
_ Turn On

Until recently, people used
to throw away old papers and
burn them up. Then they dis
covered that old papers could
be melted down and turned
into new papers again. This
turned a lot of people on.

To be turned on yourself,
first get yourself some old
papers. Almost any kind of
paper is all rightwwhite, C0.
lored, shiny, brown-r you
name it. Collect them in a
wastebasket until you are rea-
dy to be turned on. Then pick
out all the old grunjy kleen‘
exes, pop bottles, cellophane,
tin foil, bubble gum wads and
cigarette butts and put them
into a pile. Call this "Pile
'A.‘ ” Then snatch out all
the clean white and colored
paper, envelopes withoutthose
blasted little cellophane win-
dows in them, paper bags
and flimsy cardboard (the unr
corrugated kind). Call this
“Pile 8". NOW, the idea is

that Pile A won't make very
good new paper, wheras Pile
B will.

EGSY Test

As is typical in the world
of reality, for every item
that easily goes into File A
or B, half a dozen will ob-
noxiously defy classification.
in these cases, pretend you
are a paper digeSter digesting
paper at the recycling plant.
If the thing you are wondering
about would make you barf
then it probably should go
into Pile A.

The final step is no sweat.
Pick up Pile A and chuck it
into the trashcan. Pick up
Pile l3 and fling it into the
specially-marked boxes in the
hall nearest you. You might
want to sort out the news
papers and magazines into a
special pile, but then again,
who reads newspapers or
magazines?

Anguish

Recycling paper is a bit like
those “Save the Children”
tearjerkers we read about in
Time Magazine, only instead
of money we donate time and
instead of children we save
trees. ’\nd although we've got
plenty of kids right now, no
one can say we’ve got too
many trees.

At any rate, for every scrap
of paper We throw out, another
tree lets out a cry of anguish.
And that is a cosmicbummcr.

Support your local tree.

a ti by Joyce Nakamut'a

Getting up the effort to sort your trash into clean paper, newsprint and garbage is easy if you
consider your local tree’s viewpoint.
