4Kimbo: leaves To Be Curiailed

Dean of Students Conney
Kimbo revealed Wednesday
that the college will no longer
be granting personal leaves to
students who wish to take a
semester or two offfrom sch-
ool, although academic and
medical (including psycho-
logical) leaves will still be
granted.

Kimbo asserted that most
students with a solid 2.0 av-
erage who take a semester or
two off will be fairly routines
1y readmitted, so that the per
licy willprimarilyaffect those
students on ﬁnancial aid.

Under the old leave policy,
a student was guaranteed the
same level of financial aid
when he returned. The college
was often left with unused fin-
ancial aid funds (needed for
entering students) if the studs
ent decided (as was frequently
the case) not to return.

Under the new policy, a stu-
dent cannot be guaranteedfin-
ancial aid; in fact, if he skips
first semester, it is unlikely
that any financial aid can be
offered him second semester.

In addition, Kimbo told the
S&E that the college is trying
to tighten up its academic

Grinnell students were surf

reason to believe that a stud-
ent is asking for an academic
leave even though planning
not to return, the leave may
not be granted.

Kimbo stated thatmanystuds
ents take a leave as a safety
valve, even though they do not
plan to return. This leaves the
college's admissions picture
very cloudy since those who
do return tend to inform the
college of their intentions very
late.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Greek Tragedy "Baccha ” Tngen

The Grinnell Theatre De
partment will present a mod-
ern staging of the ancient
Greek tragedy “The Bacchae"
Wednesday, Friday and satur~
day nights at 8 in ARH Audie
torium.

The most original feature of
the play is the music, com?
posed and directed by Greg
Gaines. Encompassing rock,
jazz, electronic and other
contemporary music, the in-
strumentation includes a rock
group, horns, Woodwinds, str
rings and percussion.

The music and the untradir
tional stage, properties and
customes contrast the read-
ing of the William Arrowsmith
translation of the Euripides
play.

The play centers around the
conﬂict between the god Di-
onysus and Pentheus, King of
Thebes. The play opens as
Dionysus comes to Thebes to

kill Fentheus in an act of
vengeance.

The natural emotional vis-
ceral world of Dionysus is
placed against the ordered,
mainly intellectual world of
Pentheus in the play. Each
man, uncompromising in his
ideology, ultimately is shown
that the one cannot live with-
out the balancing force of the
other.

The modern stagingdesigned
by james Reeder, is used to
emphasize the contemporary
parallels of the play. Scaffol-
ding, ladders and ramps keep
all the action in the middle
of the audience. The scenery
is unobtrusive, but the cos-
t-umes are colorful and ele-
gant.

The idea of the play is to
make everything as simple as
possible. It has been limited
to what is absolutely neces-
sary; nothing on stage is with-

WWSpealts on Architecture

weonesday evening Dean Jo-
seph Wall spoke in Roberts
Theater on “Architecture in
Grinnell", which he claimed
is ”net necessarily a con-
tradiction in terms."

Using two slide projectors,
Wall showed pictures ofarch~
itectural styles in their native
locations next to pictures of
how they were "bastardized"
when transported to the “hin-
terlands" -- i.e., Grinnell.
His running commentary was
a mixture of dry humor and
affection for 'the admittedly
odd assortment ofstyles found
in Grinnell.

Grinnell, founded in 1854,
was located on a bleak, bare
stretch of prairie. The first
house built, Wall said, was
called “Long House" and st-
rongly resembleda canalboat.
From thatstart, Grinnellbuil-
dings borrowed successively
from various New England
styles, from early and late
Greek revivals, from Gethic
revival (". . . which caught
the imagination of the Amer
ican academic world. Your
wmpus ‘had to have an ivy~
covered Gothic building"),
and from twentieth century
styles.

Each of these styles, when
transported to Grinnell, un-
derwent modifitmion and, in
some cases, strange mutilar
tions. He said that the tower
called the Widow's Watch in

one New England Style was
originally built for wives to
watch for their mariner hus-
bands returning from sea. He
duly hated the irony of build
ing a Widow’s Watch in an
Iowa house.

Wall also developed his the-
cry of turrets in houses, say-
ing that ”If you hadn’t made
it quite all the way to success,
you only ran the turret part
way to the ground; while if
you were a success, you built
it the full three stories." He
then showed Greg Guroff's
(hiStory) house as an example
of the former style.

In closing his talk, Wallprer
sented a unique interpretation
of the Poweshiek County Nate
ional Bank building, whichwas
designed by renowned archi-
tect Louis Sullivan. In his later
years, Wall said, Sullivan fell
out of favor in architectural
circles and was reduced to
taking commissions where he
could find them; as a result,
he designed a lot ofsmalltown
banks in the Midwest.

Wall postulated that Sullivan
was understandably bitter, and
said of his Grinnell bank de‘
sign: “It is all a great satir-
ical joke. It seems to me that
he (Sullivan) has built a great
moneybox, with the ornament
over the door as its clasp.
And with its stainedglass win-
dows, it becomes a temple for
the twentieth century!"

I've decided to have a slight-
ly different type of column
this week, sort of in the form
of Donald Kaul’s "Workings of
an Idle Mind." First of all,
there are a lot of records to
review and not toomanyweeks
left. Second, I don’t have the
time this week to go to the
trouble of closely (7) review-
ing one album. (Honesty is a
virtue.) Third: One gets bored
doing the same thing each
week. Ask J. Edgar Hoover if
you don't believe it.

First of all, let me excite
you by telling you that a new
supergroup MAY be in the
making. (I stress the word
"may.") I just bought an
album entitled “Emerson,
Lake, and Palmer,” and it‘s
pretty damn good. There‘s
one song called “Lucky Man”
which is being (over) played
on AM, but it's a beautiful
ballad. This is the only song
on the album, however, inwh-
ich there is any amount of
singing. All three are excel-
lent musicians. Emerson
plays a fantastic piano and
organ-~plenty of firstrrate
jazz with a classical sound.
Some of this album is slightly
boring, but most of the music
is fast, exciting, and excel-
lent. Give them four or five
months and they may take it
to the old big time.

Short comments onsome new
albums:

Chicago III. I was really disr
appointed by this one. After
#2, I was expecting great th-
ings. Number Three is boring
and repetitious. One worth-
while cut is “I Just Wanna Be
Free." RatingHCe

Two Years Car-The Bee
Gees. This is truly obnoxious.

out a purpose.
The music is usedto enhance
,the moods of the play, to help
place the play in its contem-
porary setting and because the
Bacchanalian feeling seems to
demand music.

Doug Cloud and Stephen Ia-
Roque play the principles.
Laura Korach and SteveSlatiu
portray Pentheus’s mother
and grandfather.

The chorus includes Ruth
Ferry, Patty Loeb, Ann Gar‘
rison, Deni Deutsch, Susan
Monasch, Rhonda Andrews and
Nora Ellis. Other cast mem-
bers are Larry Grimm, Earl
Crecelius, Marty Sachs,Mar-
ilyn Musser, Lee Edmond and
Mary Margaret Brown.

Director of the play is Don-
ald Boros, assisted by Jane
Freidson..Rob Sackett is the
stage manager; Jane Buch-
holz, properties head; and
Susan Perkins, castume mis-
tress.

Musicians include Bob Ruhl
and Jeff Kowalski, percus-
sion; Washington Alston. st-
ring bass; Richard Strong,
electric bass; Peter Keeps
news, electric piano; Tim
Benson and Greg (hines, gui-
tars; Rod Gleysteen, trom-
bone; Roger Franz, alto saxo-

mpet; Jane Buchholz, oboeand
English horn; Sam Adler, elr
ectric flute; and JaySouthard,
electric violin.

It is so bad that it is funny,
_except it puts you to sleep
gbefore the third cut. The one
Egreat cut, "Lonely Days"

can’t come close to saving

his one. Rating-F

E Pearlujanus Joplin. One
good thin : the record com-
panies did nOt try and make
this a "Joplin Memorial Alr
bum.” Anyone who had the
notion that Joplin wasnomore
in her prime must hear

“Pearl." It leaves no doubt
that she was really just be-
ginning. The back up band,
Full Tilt Boogie, is alsofirst-
rate. Rating~A~

Friends--Elton John. Elton
wrote all the music for the
motion picture with the same
name. The music is good A
heavy piano sound and power-
ful but mellow voice. There
are a lot of Paul Bucla'naster
arrangements, which means
plenty of orchestration. If
you're not tired of the typical
Elton John sound, this album
is good. Rating-E-

I’d like to commends-(once
again)--Penguin Dave Feld-
man for his show on KDIC.
The Beatle Poll was excel-
lent, and he kept half the
campus up 'ti13A.M.ansious—
ly awaiting Grinnellians' top
10 Beatle songs. Who'd a
thunk "I'm Looking Through
You" would have beat out
“Hey Jude." Which only goes
to show that the esoteric Gr-
innell students desire for the
eternal conscious myth far
outweighs the quest for esthe-
tic perspicacityl
And don't forget, Banana is
