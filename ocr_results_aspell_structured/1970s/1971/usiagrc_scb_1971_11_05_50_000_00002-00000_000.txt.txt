TRUSTEES from page 1

sures they face at Grinnelll She
felt that the academic help could be
best provided by having regular tu-
toring sessions, ratherthanby wait-
ing until students sense they are in
academic difficulty, when it is often
too late in the term to do much good.
She said her personal opinion was
that freshmen should not be put
into the cluster system, since they
should be exposed to as many dif-
ferent groups as possible. after
their freshman year, students could
elect to draw into the cluster arr
rangement. She said she suspected
that black students not intheclustel‘
system may be doing better aca»
demically than students in the sys»
tem. One of the Trustees asked
whether Alicia considered Grinneli
a good college for a black student,

Good School

Hlf he’s enough of an individual to
cope with the problems he’ll face
here at Grinnell, its a good school
for any studen.” In reply to a
question later in the meeting, All—
cia said that, in her opinion, many
students in the cluster system may
be hurting themselves in the longs
run by limiting their opportunities
while they are at Grinnell.

Mr, Obermiller, waiting in the
audience to give his report, cone
firmed that students in the clusters
have not done as well academically
as those who do not live there, The
Dean of Students’ office informs the
SM! that 27 of the black students on
campus are living in the clusters.

City Recruiting

Alicia asked why the college does
so much of its recruiting for blacks
in the cities like Chicago and urged
that an effort be made to recruit
more students from other areas of
the country in addition. This would
give students a chance to meet and
work with black students from many
different social and economic back-
grounds. She said she found out
about Grinnell almost by accident
in her home in Shreveport, La.

Recruiting Goal

Dean Walker explained that it is
the goal of the college to recruit
as many black students as possible
from as many places as possible
The problem seems to be one at
efficiency to some extent. since
admissions people can spend more
of their time making productive con-
tacts in a city area than elsewhere,
Since Mo Hunt has been hired this
year as an admissions counsellor
and knows the Garerhicago area
well, he will be going there to culr
tivate contacts with high school
counsellors and others. Walker said
that it is necessary to establish
some rapport with counsellors,
since the admissions staff is unr
able to talk directly with students
in many high schools. Over a period
of time the admissions staff tries
to cover as much of the country as
possible.

A PASTRY
COME SEE US TODAY,

Mr. Obermiller then gave a brief
report, in which he discussed the
tutorial system and the new n07
requirement curriculum.

Wall Report

Mr. Wall then reported on the res
gistration for first semester. The
total number of credits for wllich
students have signed up is a bit
above 19000 Well then gave de-
tails about lotal credit enrollment
by departments, noting that "the
mis is pretty good" in the top ten.
He then supplied breakdowns ofaver
rage credit load/faculty member by
departments and in later discussion,
supplied an estimate of the range in
total credit load per individual far
culty member. Details of
tllis report are expected to be given
to the faculty at next week’s meet
ing.
Salaries Compared
Brief mention was made of the es»
tablishment of the search commi-
ttee to encourage hiring of more
black and women faculty members
This was followed by the results of
a comparison of Grinnell's salary
Scale to that of other schools. Wall
scale to that of other schools.
“We are hiring at a very compe»
tetive level but are not keeping this
up in the higher ranks,” said Wall
He concluded that we may be hiring
at salaries higher than are neceSr
sary to get good people His final
recommendation was that, if pos—
sible, faculty members be given a
raise at least equal to the cost of
living increase, in accordance with
an Executive Council resolution of
last June.
Miss Noble
Miss Noble then presented a re-
port on behalf of the lull time pror
fessional women with faculty rank“
“all ten of us”. In her concise,
factual report she showed that was
men faculty members are not paid
the same salary as men taculty
with comparable rank and experi—
ence, that they are given very few
positions of responsibility through
out the college, and that promotions
are very slow in coming to them.
“A double Standard seems clear,”
she said, and she urged the col-
lege to correct these inequities
which do exist by hiring more high—
ly-qualified, lull time professional
women and by providing the same
salary scales and opportunities for
women as for men faculty,
Next Week

The SftB will carry more in depth
reports next week about Miss No-
ble’s report and recommendations,
about Mr Wall’s report on credit
loads.

The Trustees discussed the ques-
tion of a tuition increase for next
year, but no final decision could be
made until President Nixon a“,
nounces details of Phase ll. As
reported in last week’s SKtB, the
amount of the tuition increase will
be directly tied in with the size
of the increase in faculty salaries.

(Editors’ Note: Welnvitecomments
from students in reply to Mr. Wynn’s
question. All comments should be
“printable.”)

To the Editors:

_In reply to Sallie c. Vel'l‘ette’s
recent letter regarding the recomr
mendations presented to the college
by certain faculty wives, several
points should be made:

1) Most of the criticisms raised
in the letter appear tobedueto mis-
understandings of the position adop-
ted by these women, misunderstand-
ings partially attributable tothe fact
that the original paper, aspresented
to theadministration,wasnecessar-
ily severely condensed tor the sofa.
The original paper, for example,
makes it clear that the group does
not feel that the college has a “duty
or obligation” to faculty wives; it
merely asks that the college Seekto
understand and help them whenever
possible. The school’s motive need
not be primarily altruistic, more-
over, since,'as‘the‘administralion
already well realizes, Grinnell lt-
Self as it now Stands can not in the

future hope to successfully vie for
the increasing number of desirable
male job candidates whose wives
have professional training and am-
bitions,

2) The women who collaborated in
the preparation of the originalpaper
were not identified in the 551.3 artir
cle due to their sheer number (Well
over 30). Anyonedesil’ing lo knowthe
identities of these women is
welcome to attend any or all of the
group meetings

3) There are indeed vel ified (but
alas, not “documented") instances
of all of the grievances implied by
the recommendations (names and
departments are understandably
withheld). These al‘ecerlainly few in
number and constitute rare excep-
tions to the usual, essentially ens
lightened college practices, How
ever, nearrperfecllon need not prer
clude perfection; there is clearly
room for improvement, The ori-
ginal paper does not illally way chase
tise the college for such abuses as
occur, it merely suggests ways in
which the school Could prevent and/
or handle them The recommenda-
tion that the college interview future
niale candidates [or specificindica-
tions of their wives’ professional
ambitions, for example, derived
from the allegation that the college
has in the past falsely implied to
some male candidates that their
Wives would ultimately be hired
Whether or not these allegations
are ]ustiiied, both the candidates
and the college would be protected
by a procedural policy which would
prevent lllis sort of 5' ualiqn from
arising, "

4) The charge thatthe recommen-
dations request “specmlslatus”ior

inal ballot, distributed early last
week, and the committee’s original
suggestions. The committee thought
a second ballot was necessary be
cause of the dissatisfaction of some
with the number of “political” and

”mediavcreated” people onthe first

list. On the first ballot, novelist

Joseph Heller and philosopher Her-
bert Marcuse received the greatest
number of votes.

When seniors’ preference votes are
tabulated, the committee will turn
the three or four most popular names
in to president Leggett's office, and
Leggett will begin sending out invi—
tations.

facully wives lS l‘atliel wide oftlie
mark. The original paper makes it
clear that the professionally quali—
fied faculty wile is normally asking
exactly what Mrs. Verrelte pres
scribes tor llel’ to “be considered
on her own mel‘ s, andnol,,,because
she is a faculty wife." (and, cons
versely, lo not be exploited or dISr
criminated against because she is a
faculty wire), The problem here, as
the recomfnendatlmis surely make
clear, is that such “equal oppor-
tunity" is notalways available to her
due to isolated instances ofmale and
professional prejudice

The recommendations that the colr
lege consider creating courses apr
propriate lo a woman's professional
skills is merely a further request
for “equal opporfilnity;” this has,
in the past, been done for lnen. The
recommendation that pal‘trtime and
split-time positions be created for
both men and Women is political; it
would help the college attract and
accommodate future male candle
dates with professional wives, and
vice versa The request thztl acar
demically qualified (underscore
H qualified”) faculty wives also be

nsidered for advisory positions is
e Sed on a widespread feeling that
there is among faculty wives an un-
tapped wealth of knowledge and ex-
pericnce which could benefit both
Students and anoverburdened faculty
in a small college town so cut off
from large cities and universities.
The professional use ofthese women
would further help to fulfill the wo-
men students’ request tor more
academic women to interact and
identify with, and 'would alleviate,
the resentment felt by those faculty
wives who already perform acar
demic advisory servicesforthecolr
lege in return for neither monetary
reward/nor professional recog-
nitiun.

As to the valid charge that women
in general are asking to be given
you preference over equally or net
terrqualified men as I understand
it, this is already current college
policy. Nobody would justify a long
term program of this kind, but
prompt redress for past inequities
Sometimes necessitates a tempo-
l‘ary imbalancing of the other side
of the scale Grinnell's record of
hiring women is so poor that only by
instituting temporary drastic mea—
