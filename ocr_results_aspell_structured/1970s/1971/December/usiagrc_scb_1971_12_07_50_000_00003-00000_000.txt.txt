Budget Siblllllon: More Students? Search Procedures Formed

by Don Dagenais

The informal trustee meetings this
weekend focused on several long
Standing problems of the current
budget which have only recently
come to be or great importance be
cause of current iinancial squeezes.

Budgetary difficulties of the college
slem largely irom the great capital
expenditures of the college extending
over the past ten years. New build-
ings during this time include Burling
Library, the Fine Arts building and
Roberts Theater, Norris Hall, the
Forum, the Book store, additions to
the Science building, and rennovar
tions in A RH.

bean Wall in a September, 19‘11,
address to the Faculty noted that
“the large deficit in the Plant rund
occurred because mayor expendi»
tures for Plant additions were not
balanced by a gift flow to the Plant
Fund. It was not possible to divert
unrestricted gifts to the Plant Fund
because the everrincreasing cost of
Current Operations necessitated
that all gift flow be directed to this
use."

Dean Walker considers this a dane
gerous situation. Grinnell now holds
an annual endowment of approx-
imately $13,000,000 at a time when
“many economists suggest thatcol-
leges oi the type and size ofGi'in-
nell should have endowments of at
least $25,000,000 to ensure a fairly
‘secure’ financial future." in order
to get the Current Budget on its feet,
and to again direct the endowment
flow towards the deficit in the Plant
Fund, the college must find ways to
increase the money flow into the
current expenditures budget.

In January of 1970 a faculty com—
mittee was formed by Dean Walker
consisting of Mr. Allen Jones, Mr.
Voertman, Mr. Verrette, Mr. Wube
beis, and Dean Wall. The committee,
at that time entitled the Committee
on Administrative Services and
Cost, had the power only to make
recommendations to the administra-
tion on budget priorities and possible
solutions to the everelncreasing
problem.

'ln September of 1970 the committee
was renamed the Budget priority

Wall To Complete
Book During leave

Mr. Joseph Wall, Dean of the Cole
lege and Parker Professor of His
tory, wnl be on leavenext semester.
He will teach one course at Brown
University in Providence, Rhode
Island, and he will do research on
a book now under contract with 0x-
iord University Press.

In Dean Wall's absence, Dean of
Administration Waldo Walker will
be acting Dean oi the College, Dur
ing the first month of next semes»
ier, Mr. Walker will also be acting
President. while President Leggett
is on leave,

Dean Wall's book, to be entitled
“The Election of 1872: The Unmak-
ing of 8 Revolution”, will be a study
of that election with reference to
Reconstruction. ilis thesis is that
1872 was the crucial election in
undoing the social evolt that was
promised by the Ci il War and Re
construction

Mr. Wall has already done some
research on his book, and expects
to complete that at Brown and do
most oi the writing as well, He
hopes to have his book ready by the
Fall of next year

Planning Committee, and, with the
absence of Mri Jones, continues un—
dci- the same iuncticn today.

During the 1970—71 academic year
serlous budget constraints were
placed on the various departments,
and as a result of the careful control
of expenditures the college finished
the year $95,000 in the black. This
was immediately applied to the
$256,000 Current Fund deficit dur—
ing the two preceding years. As
Dean Wall said last September, how-
ever, ”in view of the large Plant
Fund deficit and the Current Fund
deiicit irom previous years, [would
still have to say that...Grlnnell’s
financial problems are serious but
not critical."

Cost cutting programs are cons
tinuing, and as a result, despite ine
flation, the 1971—72 budget is
smaller than the budgetfor 1970771.
However, Wall predicts that it will
be impossible to keep expenditures
down at that level for long.

The problem is complicated by the
administration’s desire to increase
faculty salaries. Guidelines estabr
lished by the Trustees state that
there must be a direct one-to-one
relationship between the percentage
of tuition increase and the percent
age of salary/wage and operational
cost procedures, As salaries rise,
tuition must rise alsoi

No decision has been made in either
area, however, primarily because
the college has not yet received
definite indications from the Cost of
Living Council and the Pay Board
as to what the levels of increases in
salaries and tuition can be. “We
have to get the level of tuition in—
crease settled pretty soon,” Walker
said, “but we have to wait for the
Pay Board to tell us what limitar
tiuns we have.”

A tuition increase does not have
to have the general Trustees’ ape
proval. "We will just make a der
cisioh, and then write the Trustees,”
Walker said. “In any case, we
WILL balance the budget."

The Budget Priorities Planning
Committee last Spring issued a
report to tne administration Citing
their recommended solution to the
problem in the short-run, at least:
an increase in the student body.
This is merely the method by which
the college would increase the stu—
dentzfacully ratio. Three years ago
the college had a ratio of 9.3 [acute
ty members per student; next year
the ratio is projected to be 12.2:1.

Mr. Voertman, member of the
Budget Priorities committee, told
the SM? that ”in the last thirteen
years the college has developed an
impressive physical plant but en»
rollments have remained virtually
unchanged. So the physical plant
operation budget has increased relnr
tlve to the college’s direct educa-
tional budget, although both have
increased in absolute terms. Weare
underutilizing our overhead costs.”
The Committee recommends that the
student body be gradually increased
to l500 students over the next few
years.

“We have more plant than we
really need for the student body,"
said committee member Mr, Wub~
bels. ”So we advocate more stu—
dents to make use of it."

Several problems arise from this
recommendation, however, primar
ily concerning housing and admis»
sions policy. As Dean Walker said
in a memo to the Committee in

November, “the size of our appli-
cant pool is extremely small for a
college which has or aspires to have
a selective admissions policy.”

”The college has a‘very nCademlr
Cally well-qualified student body,“
said Wubbels, “but we don‘t select
them!” The strong academic repu~
tation of the college creates a sel-
ectivity iroiri discouraging poor or
only moderately welquualified stu—
dents from applying in the first
place, the Committee feels. There
fore last year only 200 applicants
out of 1200 were rejected.

Solutions to this problem are dil—
licult. Only way to accomplish an
increase in the applicant pool would
be to “make an effort to broaden
the quality range of students to
whom we tender offers of admis
sion.” Walker said. This would deA
crease the college’s standards for
students. The policy might not be
as disastrous as it sounds, Walker
points but, for “Colorado College
has done this quite gracefully for
years and turns out products who
appear to be no less qualified than
our graduates."

The housing problem should not
be solved, the Committee feels, by
building more dormitories. “We can
use houses the collegeowns now,"
Wubbels said, "instead of renting
them to faculty, They would accom-
modate 100 students at least," And
perhaps ii the town was made aware
of the necessity [or student housing,
enough off—campus facilities could
be provided. “Nobody has really
explored the possibilities,” Voertr
man said, “But I feel confident
that housing could be provided
through the town market.”

The Budget Priorities Committee
has also done some investigation
into the weights placed on various
parts of the budget, “There are many
value judgments concerning budger
tary trade-oils," Mr. Voertman
mentioned. “Last year we cut the
P.E. budgets by about $10,000 out
of a $50,000 budget," Wubbels noted.

“The major cuts came in come
petitive sports, specifically interr
collegiate athletics "

These matters are all still under
debate and by no means settled.
Solutions to the problem do not
readily present themselves, but,
as Walker notes, the college MUST
solve its budgetary problems in a
short period at time. “I guess what
we really need,” Wubbels noted,
“is for a great grandfather some
where to drop a million dollars out
or the sky.”
