Need Of Repair

Events of the last two weeks have pointed out a disturbing thing about the

”Grinnell College Community” »— that as a community it is need of repair.

At the student pressure meetings two weeks ago many students mentioned
that they saw a lack of what one might call community spirit among students,
and that they had no clear sense of the purpose of Grinnell College or the
goals which individual students should be striving for. This, some thought,
was one reason that many students were working too hard at their studies
and were not maintaing their health and sanity.

The occupation of Burling library by black students and the ensuing negoti—
ations is the most dramatic signtodatethat the “community” is in disarray.
That the members of CBS felt it was necessary to take such a drastic step
to bring their grievances to the attention of the rest of the community and
to have them dealt with in a satisfactory manner seems to be a vote of “no
confidence" in the usual channels for dealing with such problems. In the last

two years particularly many students,

faculty, and administrators have put

quite a bit of time and hard work into making committee structures and

administrative procedures that would be responsive to the needs of students,
and would be responsive all the time, as problems developed, rather than

just when they became especially noticeable or bothersome. in fact, it was
Bill Thomas' remark in the Autumn of 1959 that students should not accept
Ucrisis” type problem solving, that was the spur to the student Power

movement here.

Many reactions of other students to the actions by Concerned Black Students
seemed to contain too little concern for what was both an important problem
and a significant sign that our community needs to become one where open
and frank discussions and actions can take place on any subject, And many
faculty members expressed dissatisfaction With the fact that they were not
well informed about what was taking place in the negotiations. It is unfor»
tuhate that the situation prevented the participation of most students and
faculty, and that their knowledge, viewpoints, and ideas for solutions are
only now coming out, after most action and most of the important discussion

is already over.

We hope that next semester students, faculty, and administrators will
return to Grinnell resolved to face our weaknesses as well as our strengths,
to analyze them and to act on them together, and to go about building the
model ”Grinnell Community" cautiously yet conscientiously, remembering
that the task is not easy and that there are some difficult problems and
differences, but also remembering that the task is worthwhile, and requires

our best effort.

 

Doors Mediocre Without Morrison

by Ron Medvin

The Doors were one of the best
American rock groups ever to play
together. They were also the most
inconsistent rock group. At times,
they sounded like they could be the
Stones of America. Other times,
they sounded like a cheap American
type. But one thing was sure. The
Doors were Jim Morrison and the
Doors. When Morrison died last.
summer, the Doors, and the music
world, suffered a terrible blow.
Morrison was one of the most dy-
namic and brilliant performer—com—
posers ever to enhance rock music

The Doors are still around, and
they are trying to provethatthey can
still make it without Morrison On
their new album, other Voices they
sound as if they are putting a half-
hearted effort into their work. There
is no doubt that Morrison is sorely
missed.

This entire album is acollection of
mediocre tunes. There is not one
song, or even a small part ofasong,
which generates any excitement,
Doors fans may be angry to hear
someone think a Doors album is
poor, but you have to be quite a
devoted fan to like anything on this
album.

The musical theme of the album is
“weakness”. ”In the Eyes of the
Sun” is a soft rock number with a
nice electric piano background.
There is also a consistently quiet
but moving bass background which
enhances the song, but the music
on the whole is sluggish. It is typir
cal 0f the whole album. The music
is...nice, thereare nomusicalllaws,
but the power of the old Doors is
not there.

”Ships w/ Sails“ begins with a
beautiful instrumental section high—
lighted with a conga percussion sec-
tion. But it gets to be pretty repetir
tlous, and again, the whole thing
sounds weak. The song has an organ
solo which sounds like a low7key
copy of “Light My Fire”; the very
fact that it is, in fact, so lowrkey
accounts for why the song doesn't
come at ross It does have somenice
images in the lyrics: ”Well you ask
how much i love you/Why do ships
with sails love the wind?/...Till the
four winds bring you back to me/

25 December 7, 1971

Don't count your memories/Think
of me as just a dream/Just likethis
melody I sing.” But the singing too
lacks emotion, you just can’t imir
tate Morrison.

Morrison is missed the most in
“Tightrope Ride" ahard-rock num-
ber with a repetitious sound. The
lyrics are very good here. It's a
song which could have been written
to Morrison after he died: “But
you’re all alone / Like a rolling
stone/Like Brian Jones/On a tight-
rope ride," Morrison died of a
heart-attack, which many feel was
brought on by the amount of liquor
and speed which he used, The music
tails to live up to the lyrics, and
another poss'bl good song is ruined,

lithium

The songs on side are even
worse. it’s hard to distinguish be-
tween them; they all sound the same.
They are all, with one possible eit-
ception, boring. The exception is
“i'm Horny, I’m stoned”. It's a
lively, fast rocker with a great rag
piano solo. The harmonies are a bit
weak and out of tune, but this song
does come across well, The lyrics
are serious and moving, again pos-
sibly referring to Morrison. “Well,
l’m tired I'm nervous, f'm bored,
l’m stoned/Don't you know life ain’t
easy when you're on your own.”
This song is really the only onethat
you can call a “good” song on the
album, The other cuts lack sub»
stance, lack drive, and are generally
boring.

It seems as if the other Doors are
going to miss Morrison more than
they might think. They are either
going to have to find a new lead sing-
er, someonc who at least approaches
Morrison’s style, or else produce
better music It is nice to see that
the other three musicians did not
Just give up. But they could have
waited a little longer to put out a
first album; waited until they were
competent enough to do so.

Theft

To the Editors:

This past Friday, November 26th,
two color silkscreen prints by Susan
Gardner were taken from the corri-
dor of the Scheaffer Gallery in the
Fine Arts Building where they were
on exhibit, The prints, “The Man Le-
my 5." and "Yellow Chair,” were
values at $60.00 each. Thefts from
the exhibitions and College Collec-
tion this semester now total closeto
$500.00 in value. Our insurance
company is putting pressure upon us
to terminate our policy or make it
3500,00 deductible, which would be
tantamount to the same thing.

Accordingly, we have cancelled the
last scheduled show for this semes-
ter, “Contemporary Phorography
Since 1950," a collection of 50 photo-
graphs circulated by the George
Eastman House of Rochester, New
York. The items were simply too
small and too portable. We are also
giving consideration to the possible
cancellation completely or in partof
next semester’s exhibitions,

it is our feeling that the thefts of
these works of art, the large scale
thefts of equipment from the Depart-
ment of Music and the wholesale
thefts of books from the Library are
part of a general disregard by many
students for the collective resources
of the community. It has become a
“jag“ to “rip off” the College. But
this is ultimately a self destrictive
”jag. " Therts of books have reached
epidemic proportions. Losses in art
and photography alone have
amounted to thousands of dollars in
the past few years. In a number of
recent instances, these losses have
seriously crippled the preparation of
art courses and the subsequent as—
signment of critical readings. The
loss of art books is particularly
damaging since many of the slides
used to illustrate art lectures are
prepared from the pictures in those
books.

in a community such as Grinnell,
cut off from major art centers and
museums, the impairment of an art
exhibition program and the large
scale loss ofart hooks and equipment
only increase that isloation. Ulti-
mately, it can be the kiss ofdeath to
a lively and up to date program in
the arts. ,

To date, students have shown little
inclination to exert the kind ofpres-
sure on their peers that would re-
duce such losses. In lieu of the ex-
ercise of sich collective peer group
pressure, we feel that it is incum»
bent upon the Faculty to do what is
within its power to cut theselosses.
Therefore, we are making the fol-
lowing recommendations to the fac-
ulty:

i) Unauthorized removal ufbooks
from the Library, Works ofart from
exhibitions or the College Collec-
tion, or equipment and suppliesfrom
any department carry with them the
mandatory punishment of expulsion
from the College.

2) The Library Committee begin
immediate consideration of a system
of controlled access and inspection
for the Library to be made opera»
tional as soon as the move of the
Administration from Burling Base-
ment is complete. This proposal
should be returned to the faculty for
implementation before the move
from Burling Basement is begun.

Courses

To the Editors:

It is my feeling that partaftheprob-
lem we are now facing is that someof
the work we are doing is unnecessary
to the skills a student receives in
courses, I am posing as one solution
to academic dissatisfaction an empha»
sis in classes on analysing educational
objectives and means. lnasense, stu-
dents will be able to form a type of

And Reviews

contract with each class they take.

Consider, that in some cases, alarge
number of papers and tests may not be
the best medium by which a student
can learn. The emphasis in many
courses is not on what happens in a
class, but instead on the papers and
tests a student turns in for evalua-
tion. Because of an emphasis on what
can be evaluated, papers and tests,
the skills that are developed in a
classroom with other people are de-
emphasized and forgotten, The
classroom, theoretically a viable
educating structure, is then not used
to its fullext extent.

1 agree that education must be some
what individualized, but not isolating.
At Grinnell, in at least the last month
of every semester and earlierin some
classes, the classroom clearly be-
comes a secondary tool. The primary
learning tool becomes the typed page.
Students and faculty should begin to
consider whether papers are indeed
the best and only method to learn by.

An over-emphasis on paper writing,
though, is just one example of many
policies that are assumed beneficial
without being questioned. To avoid
misplaced priorities students should
discuss and be aware of what each
class will demand fora semester.
During the first week of class students
and faculty could talk about the best
methods for making a course a suc-
cess. This way the ilow olasemester
would be controlled to the extent that
everyone knows why they are there,
and how they can best go about learnv
lhg.

in some cases professors would not
be willing to implement students’
ideas into their course, It may be a
right of a professor to run a course
in the way he sees fit, In these cases,
at least the student would, know the
professor’s position and would be able
to determine if his needs could be ful—
filled in that class. If not the students
would have the option of dropping the
course and not signing his contract. i
believe through this procedure both
students and professors could function
with confidence in an academic atmos»
phere where everyone knew that a
clear-cut relationship existed be-
tween the work an individual did and
what the course offered to him.

i do not think though, that you can
legislate a policy forcing professors
to change their courses as students
see fit. But it seems like a simple
procedure to delay digging into the
course material immediately after
registration long enough to discuss
how a class is going to berun and why
that way is the best approach. This
community would be stupid to begin
another semester without stopping and
trying to determine the best way we
can learn.

Blacks

To the Editors:

in the present controversy over the
fulfillment of black demands there
seems to be a refusal on the part of
the white community to confront the
reality of the situation. The occupa-
tion of the library and the presenta—
tion of the manifesto represents a
black power move--power to deter
mine college policy and increasethe
amount of resources allocated to the
black community.

Examples at the white community’s
response to this power move indicate
that either it does not realize what
the situation is or feels too intimi»
dated to express it. The NBC Many»
festo is both childish and cowardly.
Mesmerizing oneself in the throes
of white racist guilt may have some
psychological benefits, but it does
not make the problem of a power
struggle go away.

The white community has a signir
ficant and legitimate interest in
these proceedings. If some of the
more important black demands are
fully Satisfiedr—eg” the admission
of 200 black students and the re~
structuring of the financial aids pro-

gram to pay for this increaseuthe
white community is definitely going
to be hurt. Grinnell College has lim-
ited resources. An increase in the
allocation of resources to blacks
which do not directly benefit the en~
tire community means that white
students have to suffer Eltherwhite
students receive less financial aid
or through a cut in the academic
budget the quality of their education
is reduced, These are legitimate in-
terests, connected with the basic
survival of the white community and
the institution as a whole. It is dan—
gerous for the white community to
cloak a largely economic issue in
moralistic terms.

A well—led, organized, and unified
black community has accomplisheda
brilliant tactical Victory in this
phase of the power struggle. The
black community now has strong
advantages. The white student body
is incapable of intelligent, rational
response; it is fragmented and
confused to the extent that public
expressions or guilt and crude wit-
ticisms are all they can come up
with, The Administration is notorr
iously “wishyrwashy”.

I would like to counsel the black
community to heed the lessons of
history; the victor is often best
served by kindness to the van-
quished, The advantages of today
may not always be present, The
white community may eventually
realize that it does have a legitimate
interest in these affairs; that its
ability to attend Grinnell in the
rirst place and the subsequent value
of a Grinnell education may be ser»
iously in danger. Communication be»
tween both communities, firmly
grounded in a mutual understanding
of the legitimate interests of both
sides, may lead to a tolerable solu—
tion. Without this communication,
however, tensions build up. If there
is a danger that the white commun-
ity, intimidated to the point that it
cannot express its legitimate inc
terests, will respond in irrational
ways, there is more bra danger,l
feel, of long term white student
withdrawal than backlash retaliatory
measures. The black community and
the Administration must remember
that as white students departsodoes
white money, which, after all this
institution runs on.

Evaluations

To the Editors:

1 would like to express my dismay
at the manner in which student eval—
uation of faculty is being handled,
The nature of the questionnaires
presumes that the only issue at
stake is recontracting a person,
not improving the quality of his
courses.

It would seem much more desirable
that questions be designed to givethe
individual instructor feedback on his
courses in order to improve that
course. Very likely, each instructor
and his class should determinewhat
questions are important in evaluat-
ing their course, Questionnaires in
themselves presume and promote an
impersonal atmosphere; they sug~
gest that in some sense the Students
are passing judgment upon a faculty
member ror use by an outside arbi-
trator Of more immediate value is
a situation in which students feel at
ease to suggest improvements in a
course and to work with the instruc-
tor to create a situation of intellecA
tual interchange,

The concept of impersonal ques-
tionnaires implies that theburdenof
responsibility for the course lies
with the instructor, and that lfsome-
thing goes wrong, it is the instrucA
tor's fault it tends to perpetuate the
dichotomy between teacher and Stu»
dent, and to underestimate the stu-
dent’s responsibility for a success»
ful class. A class in which thereisa
