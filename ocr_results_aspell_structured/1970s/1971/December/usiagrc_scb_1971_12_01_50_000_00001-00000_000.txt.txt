Students who went up to the doors of Burling library Monday morning found chained
doors and posters with slogans such as

The chronology at events relating
to the Black occupation of Burling
Library and the negotiations or the
Black Maniiesto on Monday, Novem-
ber 29 and Tuesday, November 30,.
are listed below to the extent that
they can or have beendeterminedby
the SELB.

Early Monday morning, around 6:00
a.m., all or almost all Of the black
students on campus met in Younker
Lounge.

Those students who had not known of
speciiic plans ior occupying Burling
and presenting the Black Manifesto
to the administration Monday were
then told of those plans.

Around 7:00, several of those stue
dents Went to the campus mail room
and began distributing copies oi the
Black Manifesto in mailboxes They
did not complete the stuiiings, and
leit a large stack at copies on a
counter in the mail room

At 7:15, most of the black students
went to Burllng library. They were
able to get in the building by a door-
left unlocked by the night watchman
They asked the watchman to leave.

The night Watchman leit the build-
ing, and hotiiied President Leggett
that the black students wereoccupye
ing Hurling

President Leggctt, caught shovele

immediately to the library. l-ie are

was later Joined by Deans Walker
and Wall

Leggett, Wall, and Walkermetwith
a group of about ten black students in
the President’s office, and were pre»

broke up, so that theadministraloi‘s

the blacks conieramong themselves

cerned things which werebeingdone
already by the administration, or
were already being done

Leggett told the son that he was
surprised that many blacks wereune
aware oi some oithe nctionsalready
In process

Among the reasons the meeting
Monday morning took iour hours,
President Leggett explained, was
that there was a need tor explanae
tions of the administrations past
actions with regard to black stue
dents, and the administration asked
blacks to explain what some ot the
points oi the Maniiesto really meant,
stripped oi the rhetoric

Also discussed Monday morning
were the reasons why blacks iclt it
necessary to hring their grievances
in the way they did.

Leggett said that the black students
told him they telt this (occupation oi
Burling and the Black Manilasto)wns
the only way they could bring ate
tentioh to the way black students are
mistreated on this campus.

Also, during the morning, many
blacks leit and entered Burling. The
best estimates indicate that there
were approiomately 55 black stu-
dents in Hurling at thetime Leggett,
Wall, and Walker arrived.

Mr. Henry Alden, head librarian,
was admitted to the building by
blacks He worked in his ofﬁce
several hours during the morning.
Alden was the only white person
outside oi Leggett, Wall,and Walker
who Was allowed in the building bee
tween 715 am. and 1230 pm
Many students approached the li-
brary Monday morning without real-
izihg that it was being occuped.
They saw posters with such slogans
or questions as “Do You Deny Us
As Black People The Right To Be
Free?", and “We Are All American
People Proud Of Our Blackness,
We Want To Express Ourselves And
Our Blackness anur Academic Lite
On This Campus "

Some white students tried to push
open the front doors to the library,
but the inside push handles were

chained shut.

Blacks sometimes stayed in the
entrance alcove and opened the doors
‘or other blacks who wished to leave.
or enter the building.

At midemorning, Dean oi student
Aiioirs Conney Kimbo returned to
Grinnell irom lowa city He went
immediately to Hurling, was ad
mitted by black students atthedoor,
and joined the group in the Presi—
dent's oiiice

One black student leit Burling as
an oiiicial delegate to the Student
Government Association. He coh-
ierred with the SGA cabinet, several
house presidents, and some other
students both at the SGA oiiiceihthe
Forum and by telephone irom Bure
ling.

At that time, the possibility oi
calling an all campus meeting under
the auspices of SGA, or under SGA
and the black students jointly, was
discussed, but the decision was made
to not hold any such meeting.

Several private students who had
planned a meeting themselves ior
the evening also called it on

in recent developments with the
negotiations between college oi—
ticials and the Concerned Black
students:

"College representatives met with
CBS negotiators tor the greater part
oi today. No oiiicial statements were
made by either CBS or the college
negotiating team heiore the son went
to press this aiternoon.

W A special iaculty meeting was
scheduled ior tomorrow aiternoon.
A proposal approved yesterkay
evening by the Executive Council,
which would establish a separate Ade
missions Board to consider admis-
sions oi black students whose cre-
dentials iall outside the general
guidelines set by the Admissions
Committee, will be considered then.

-- A meeting ofsome six to eight
Trustees with the black students has
been scheduled tor 11:00 a.rn. Sun-

planned to come to Grinnell to res
view the budget and several others
who are coming specialwiilbehere.

S&B Extra

This extra edition oi the Scarlet and Black is being published so
that students will be kept up to date on the many events oi the last
iew days, mainly the actions taken by black students and the negotia-
tions now in progress on the demands oi the Black Mamiesto, but
also the numerous acts oi vandalism occurring in the past day and

one half.

This newspaper may serve two other purposes

it may give the

campus an up todote news reportotherthan the Des Moines Register
and the college ihiormation oitice, and it may serve as background
and a point or reterence ior any iactual matters ior the discussion
between white students and CBS representatives. Those meetings
would probably be best spent in discussions oi the rationales ior
the points oi the Maniiesto and oi iuture plans rather than discus
sions and questions about past events,

We hope there are not too many glaring errors in this paper; but
undoubtedly there will be some mistakes we hopeyou will apprece
iate our eiiort and correct us at or beiore the meetings tonight.

The Editors

with CBS representatives reached a
strong consensus that iniormaticn
could best be relayed to Students in
such meetings.

One oi the CBS negotiators Law—
rence Wright explained the meetings
to the SELE “...we have agreedafter
we investigate to make public pree
sentations about what we are about,
to give some indication oi courses
in which negotiations are taking
place, and to explainthe manilesto ”

The locations at the tour meetings
are Cowles lounge (all students live
mg north of Rawson hall), Younker
lounge (all students who live southoi
Gates on North Campus), Loose
lounge (all students who live north
oi James hall on south campus) and
Main lounge (all students who live
south of Haines hall.

Tuesday evening house presidents
met informally with CBS represent~
atives to discuss with them the ties
mands they have been negotiating
with the administration.

The meeting was notaiormalmeet-
ing at the Joint Board, because no
minutes were kept and the meeting
was never iormally called to order.

CBS representatives had requested
that no members of the pressbe ad,
mitted and that the meeting be closed
to students who were not either
members of the Joint Board or
members 01‘ CBS Since the Joint
Board cannot constitutionally hold
tormal closed meetings, the pro-
ceedings were made lniormal,

Sources who attended the meeting
gave a sketchy report to the Still
of the proceedings.

CBS representatives tirst dis
cussed pointehyepoint the rationale
behind the demands in the Black
Maniiesto and answered questions
irom those present.

in the ensuing discussion board
members seemed sympathetic to the
general aims of the black students.

Many members oi the anrdslgned
a petition oi general support which
was circulated by one oithe house
presidents (not by CBS).

Finally, Board members discussed
with CBS how best to inform the
campus about the situation

it was eventually agreed that meet»
lugs similar to their own he held
around campus where CBS repres
sentatives would be given the oppor
tunity to explain to students their
reasons ior making the demands
they did.

The final topic was whether SGA
should try to be represetnted at the
negotiating sessions

After some discussion there was
a general consensus that the SGA
cabinet should make an attempt to
he represented.

This was communicated by meme
hers oi the SGA cabinet to CBS,
which held a meeting late in the
evening to discuss strategy tor to»
day's bargaining sessions and to
consider the questions or SGA rep-
resentation

SGA spokesmen had attended the
lust negotiating session Mondayaf-
ternoon, but they leit when the CBS
representatives asked them to»-
heiore any serious negotiating was
undertaken.
