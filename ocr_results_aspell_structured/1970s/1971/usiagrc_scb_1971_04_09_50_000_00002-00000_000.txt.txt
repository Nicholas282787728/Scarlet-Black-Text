loose Ha

by Debbie McKnight

The Loose Hall experiment
originated last year in a con-
versation between then freshr
man John Pfeffer and Loose
RAs Skip and Flo McMullin.
An ad hoc committee of Loose
residents then formed to con-
sider the matter seriously.
Pfeffer, Bill Kilpatrick, and
Mary Stuart signed the orir
ginal proposal to create “het-
erogeneous floors" in Loose
this year. Their aim was ”to
allow a better understanding
of the opposite sex as per-
sons." Loose was suggested
because of its size and multi-
ple bathrooms per floor.

The Housing Committee,
Deans Lowe and Kimbo, and
the campus in general found
the Loose experiment an ac-
ceptable new living situation.
It was a logical outgrowth of
the limited coed situation al-
ready in Loose and the Youn~
kers, and it was compatible
with the general spirit of dorm
freedom, which has increased
steadily since the campuses
integrated three years ago.
Loose was responsible for
some extension of that free-
dom. Its existence made ridi—
culous all reference to the
old 84-hour-a-week opens,
except in the case of individr
ual floors with self-imposed
restrictions.

As the first year ofthe Loose
experiment ends and two other
halls are designated for simi-
lar arrangements next year,
evaluation seems in order.
Overwhelming con cen su s
finds the coed situation suc-
cessful. Many residents inter~
viewed for this article found
it almost difficult to discuss,
saying that after the first few
weeks they had stopped think-
ing of coed floors as any kind
oi“ "experiment."

Resident's Views

Following are excerpts from
the interviews which offer
some observations on parti-
cular advantages and disad-
vantages. Most complaints ab~
out Loose might be leveled at

all of Grinnell dorm life. An.

effort was made to concentrate
on the coed aspect.

John Pfeffer, as one of the
originators of the plan, had
rather high hopes that were
not completely realized. He
saw the faults of Loose in
terms of general campus con-
ditions:

"We wanted to alter menand
women’s attitudes toward each
other. I don't think the dorm
progressed as far as it should
have in this kind of change.
As a result oflastMay’s traur
ma, people’s mood on this
campus was quite different in
the fall from what it usually
is. Relations were more str-
ained. It was harder to have
any community life. Also, last
May scared a lot of people.
They began to see the need for
studying, so they spend less
time in the dorm."

Bill Kilpatrick shared some
of Pfeffer’s disappointment
and said, "It's a good thing
neither Pfeffer norI werehall
president. We were such zear
lots about it. But Ido like what

happened this year. Wewanted
a close dorm. It‘s good as far
as dorms go here. l’m con-
vinced that the idea was a
sound one.

”If you have a coed dorm
that's coed by floors, it’s very
easy to just mess around with
the guys orgirls onyour floor.
If you're going to have a coed
dorm, it should be really coed.
Now when we play frisbee it's
with both men and women ,
they’re your friends and they
happen to be of both sexes.

“Last year Iappreciatedwo-
men as people. This year I
appreciate them as objects.
Now I can look at women both
as people and as ‘sexobjects.’
Seriously. The two aren‘tmu-
tually exclusive. I guess this
year I learned a lot about my
own sexuality. I've also be-
come more frank with girls.

"When we were getting this7

thing together, the big ques-
tion was always 'what about
the bathrooms?‘ We weretry-
ing to get rid ofa lot of those
kinds of inhibitions. If Loose
Hall has failed, it is in the
degree to which people still
have those hang-ups."

R A 5 Comment

Bob and Mary Flanagan re
ported being "pleased" at
their appointment as RAs for
the experimental hall.

”Most of the problems I
anticipated hadto do with some
rather perverse ideas that
people pick up about how colr
lege-age men and women re-
act to each other," said Bob.

Mary suggested one problem
which had arisen: ”In the be-
ginning some women felt that
they weren’t getting to lcnow
each other here. Many had
lived in women's halls before
this year, and they missed the
closeness with other women.
They felt that they were re-
lating almost entirely to men
just because it was a coed
dorm. I think the sexattitudes
discussions we've been having
arose partly from their need.

“But there haven’t been any
serious problems with Loose
as a coed dorm. This is pro—
bably because the people who
drew into it really wantedthis
kind of situation."

Shelley Floyd, women’s pre-
sident, said she "went into
this as a kind of experiment,
thinking that it would be a
good experience whether it
worked or not.

”Living in Loose has rein-
forced some of my previous
cynical ideas about the tradir
tional ways couples relate in
our society. Datingis probably
gone for good from this came
pus, which I think is fine.
But without it we’re sort of
ﬂoundering around for social
forms. I think coeddormsmay
replace dating as the source
of social interaction.

in a coed dorm. Because there
are so many opportunities for
spontaneous social life all the
time, you don't feel a com-
punction to go out every Fri-
day or Saturday night."

Loose Drawbacks

Mike Swackhammer, elected
men's president this semester
when Ed Hirsch left campus,
has lived in cored dorms for
three years, “so this isn’t a
lot different for me. The coed
situation is especially good
for freshmen, making easier
for them to know more
people."

More interested in the debate
over close dorms and ”apart-
ment living," Mike said,
"There’s always a conflict
over whether interests inside
or outside the dorm are more
desirable. I don’ t know quite
how it should be resolved. If
you had a four year dorm,
you’d have to get to lmow the
people in your ball. That was
one of the strengths of the
four-year system. But one of
the reasons the old hail sys»
tem fell apart was that people
began to feelactivities outside
the dorm were more import-
ant. There just isn’t a real
press on campus now for close
dorm relationships, and the
people who want them are a
minority.”

Second floor SA Annc Igara-
shi observed: "Cm a coed
floor you're exposed. It‘s ease
ier to sort of ‘blend in' and be
part of a kind of-herd on a
single sex floor. But on a
coed ﬂoor you‘re forced to be
more an individual."

Four freshmen girls earned
dubious fame first semester
by living in the pit study
lounge. Withdrawals let them
move into two ordinary doubr
les second semester. Window-
iess and isolated from every-
ming except the laundry room,
the study lounge had obvious
drawbacks. Asa quad, its chief
problem, according to Jean

In spring...

Tracy, was that "somebody
was always asleep."

Katie Puckett, anorher resin
dent, told the advantages:
"There was always somebody
to talk to, and a lothappening.
With three roommates each
of us met a lot more people.
We were also lucky in justbe*
ing a super compatible group.
Even though the quad was iso-
lated, its uniqueness and size
made it a gathering place for
the floor and other people,
too.”

Lynn McMahon added: "Liv—
ing in the quad and in Loose
really colored my views of
Grinnell. I thought everybody
had good friends who were
boys. In generallhadanideal-
ized View."

The most frequent com-
plaints about Loose were its
noisiness and the lack of pri-
vacy. Two people also com-
mented thatthe dorm isalmost
loo self» contained:

“We’re not exactly extras
verted. There’s no incentive
for leaving because the dorm
has everything - good lounge,
laundry room. Other people
may come to our parties or
watch TV here, but we rarely
go to other dorms."

”A girl from another dorm
visiting here said people igr
norc outsiders. They onlytalk
to other Loose residents. So-
metimes we give a cliquish
impression.”

Criticisms

If these observations are
correct, they are probably
due to the building's physical
plant and to some success by
the hall leadership, rather
than to anything inherent in
its coed nature. Activities like

cert, the 1950’s sock hop, and

ways grahsatintimacy ‘wow,
we have a chance for deep
interpersonal relationships
here.’ But they don‘t realize
that along with the good parts
were are bad things about
being close. By living here
you learn some of the less
pleasant things about people,
and unless you're prepared
for it, that might be a shock.

“People talk about learning
not to see each other as ‘sex
objects.’ I'm not so sure that
living here really does change
people's views about the oppo-
site sex. Maybe it just brings
out and makes clear the atti’
tudes they already have.

“I didn't think guys here
looked at us sexually. [thought
we were just friends. Then
one night I was in a conver-
sation where some boys were
talking about this game they
called 'the power play.‘ It in-
volves something like trying
to see which of them can coma
pletely get the attention of
some girl in the room.

“i told them what they were
doing was an example of re
acting to women only as sex
objects, and they couldn't even
see what I was talkingabout."

Attitudes developed over a
lifetime will not change thr-
ough one quick semester in a
coed dorm, but perhaps more
experience with this arrange-
ment really can create “better
understanding of the opposite
sex as person' and as sex."
