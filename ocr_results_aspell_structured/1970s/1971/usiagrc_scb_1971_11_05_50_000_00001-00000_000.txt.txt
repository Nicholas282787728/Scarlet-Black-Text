The Grinnell draft board has notir
tied the 55:8 that under current
selective service policy, a regis-
trant born in 1951 or before may on
his written request relinquish a
deferment in Class 1-3, ”-5, ll-A,
me, or III—A This policy makes it
possible for a registrant with a
lottery number above 125 to enter
the First Priority Selection Group
(class 17A) in 1971 and thereaiter
be assigned to the Second Priority
Selection Group in 1972

This action would limit draft vul-
nerability in the iuture except in
case of major mobilization.

Any man wishing to take advantage
of this opportunity must have his
written request to his local board
wltll u postmark on or before Dc-
cemlicr 31, 1971, The request ior
i-eclassiiication under this policy
will in no way deprive a man of the
right to be considered foranydeferr

Womeus Gym

The Trustees had voted at all
earlier meeting to tear down the
Women’s Gym; Shelley urged the
board to reconsider the decision,
primarily because of the building’s
historical and aesthetic interest.
Terry Clifford then took the floor
briefly to explain the role oi this
year’s Student Coordinators.
Kathi Ellis informed the hoardthat
the Counselling Committee is pros
paring to evaluate the counselling
program at Grinnell to see whether
it is meeting the needs of students
under the new curriculum,

Trustee Questions

One ofthe Trustees asked why there
was less interest in graduate school
now than before. Another asked whee
that the disenchantment among stile
dents with the business community
continued. Another asked whether
students were taking an interest in
elections, the local Grinnell elec~
tions in particular, Somediscusslon
{allowed each of these questions.

At this point Alicia Thomas asked
whether the policies of the college
affecting black students were to be
discussed at the meeting. She had
come to the meeting because she was
concerned about some rumor she
had heard concerningthesepoli es.
Specific rumors she mentioned CD"-
cerned a possible quota system for
black admissions and posslbtetrus»
tee dissatisfaction with the black
students on campus

No Quota System

in the ensuing discussion, various
members of the Board of Trustees
assured Miss Thomas that'in the
several discussions they have had
that involved black students in one
way or another, therewasneverany
sentiment of the sortshementioned.
Nor was it the policy of the college
to iunctinn on a quota system for the
admission of black students. Dean
Walker pointed out that although in
each of the last two years nineteen
black students entered the college
this was not because otthe college’s
policy so much ashecauseoichance,
since last year, for instance, 50
black students were offered adv
mission. Walker said that about 22%
oi the financial aid program being
used for freshmen students was
going to black students,

Younker Experiment

In response to questions from the
Trustees, Miss Thomas suggested
that the college might re-evaluate
the cluster system in the Younkers,
because she felt that it has not
functioned as it was expected to
when it was formed.

She thought that the original Cons
cept oi the cluster was good, and
that is why she joined, She pointed
out that black students, especially
freshmen, were expected to be able
to get help and advice from other
black students to helpthem copewith
whatever academic and sociaipres-

Once again, midesemester break
this year was the last chance to get
rid of pets. The Social Policies and
Regulations committee, unable to
find an alternative, decided at their
open meeting on Oct. 22nd, that the
current anti-pet rule must stand.
Eight students attended to defend
their animal iriends, but complaints
or allergies, noise, odor and over
crowding won out. The Dean oi
students is responsible ioreniorcing
the rule, but he has not disclosed
proposed methods,
