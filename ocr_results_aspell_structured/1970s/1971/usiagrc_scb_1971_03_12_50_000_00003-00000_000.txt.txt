THE SCARLET AND BLACK

RA Morris Observes GrinneII

Rather than havtng a report-
er present the reporter's view
of his ideas, R.A. Dave Morris
diose to write his own inter
view.)

I decided to be a Resident
Adviser because the job desr
cription seemed vague enough
for each R.A. to derive his own
interpretation of what he is to
do. I found this to be true. The
life of an R.A. is some mix*
ture of freedom and insecure
try.

I came to Grinnell, Iowa, as
one who has spent all his life
(except travel on vacations)as
a resident of California. Iwas
born in Los Angeles and raised
in its suburbs. I left that city
(never to return) for Santa
Barbara where I did my urr
dergraduate work at the Unie
versity ofCalifornia, graduat-
ing in 1968 with my E.A. in
Sociology. I later didgraduate
work- at U.C. Berkeley for a
MA. in the Sociology of Educ
cation.

Moving from Berkeley’s 27,
000 students (plus the sur-
rounding cultural/political
community) to Grinnell's ’200
student body (onerthird the
population of my high school)
has been a strong contrast.
The most noticeable change
has been a loss of personal
anonymity.

This is especially true in my
function as an R.A. instead of
the student Ihavealwaysbeen.
I feel the only difference be
tween Grinnell students and
myself is that 1 am three to
five years older than most
students. In this difference is
my only strength as a count
selor. »

Look at it this way: suppose
you are twenty years old. Try
to visualize the next four
years of your life and what
changes you may go through
as a result of those years.
Will those changes make a
difference? Of course. Well,
I‘ve already had those four
years.

I see my function at Grinnell
as being an older person who
is available for personal dis-
cussions virtually twenty four
hours a day. I am older, yet
not so old that I do not clearly
remember my own life as a
student. Idrawmy pay because
I'm making myself available
to Grinnell students every day
for eight months of my life.

had a course in it. The major

part of my counselingfunction
here is listening, acting as a
"sounding board" againstth
ich students can listen to their
own ideas. However, listening
is nOt necessarily a passive
role. I try to be receptive.

Often, thoughnotalways, Stur
dents talk about problems-7
about decisions they are facr
ing. Inever (I hope) make de-
cisions for students, for de-
cisions should be made by
those who have to live with the
consequences ofthe decisions.
I feel my job is to make sure
the person making the decisr
ion is aware ofallthepossible
alternatives from which he
may choose. I try to ask good
questions.

I’ve been working part- time
as the college's Institutional
Researcher-if anyone inside
or outside the college wants
facts about the college, Pin the
one who’s supposed to find out
those facts. The conclusion
I’ve reached after encountere
ing many facts isthatGrinncll
presents a high quality educae
tion. Student-faculty ratio is
on the whole a good indicator
of a school's quality, and Orr
innell's 11101 is excellent,
especially when compared to
almost all other institutions of
higher education in the coun~
try.

Yet I wouldn’t call Grinnell
an ideal campus. My graduate
career at Berkeley taught me
that education is not the mon-
oply of the classroom, that
what is gained in the class
room is affected by the envir-
onment inwhich the classroom
exists. In this year I‘ve been
spending at Grinnell I’ve been
making a few observations
about Grinnell’s environment.

Many people at Grinnell are
afraid of other people. When
I walkaround the campus many
people I pass pretend I'm not
there. Their eyes see me and
pretend they haven‘t; their
ears hear my footsteps and
pretend they haven‘t. Whatam
I that my cxistance cannot be
acknowledged? I can only think
that those people are afraid
of me, are threatened by me.
Why?

Many of us haveremarked on
this year's general apathy amr
ongst students, amongst our
selves. There seems to bca
loss of the drive to ”got in
volved"—-to put forth effort.
What is being said when only
one person on campus wants
to put forth the effort neces-
sary to be student body pm,
sident?

This lack of any sort ofspirit
has of course affected educa-
tion at Grinnell. There is so
rong evidence of a spectator
frame Ofmind" ”Imight learn
something ifsomeone willmo-
tivate mc." Unfortunately, ed-
ucation inside or outside the
classroom takes effort and

those who try to supply moti—
vation to others may soon be
come exhausted.

It appears thatGrinnell's gen
eral apathy is a national
phenomenon in colleges this
year. A good deal of this may
be due to a loss of direction.
Why put forth effort unless
there is an end to aim for?
Politics, whether student or
civic, are means to ends, but
what are the ends? In what
directions do we want to
travel?

My own life has beenaffected
by this. In June I return to
California and I don't know
what I’m going to do. I have
no plans for the future. Jobs,
the usual stand-bys, are hard
to find; there aren’t enough to
go around. I think I’ll search
for a direction to take.

Donahue To Teach Transcendental Meditdi" it

by Tricia Smith
and Nancy Wilson

According to MaharishiMaA
hesh Yogi in The Science of
Being and Art of Living, "Ed-
ucation aims at culturing the
mind of a man to enable him
to accomplish all he wouldlike
to accomplish in the great field
of life. Education should necr
essarily enable a mantomake
use of his full potential in the
field of his body, mind and
spirit. But it should also deve
elop in him the ability to make
the best use ofhis personality,
surroundings and circumstan-
ces so that he mayaccomplish
doe maximum in life for hime
self and for all others. There
are tremendous possibilities
latent in these fields which
are never fathomed or unfold-
ed by young people during
their student life, which is the
most precious time for build-
ing up the career of man."

Maharishi Mahesh Yogi proV
pounds a philosophy of life
with a practiml purpose in
mind. He wants to introduce
people to a simple technique
which will enable them to ex-
perience even greater fulfill-
ment in life. The technique is
called transcendental medita-
tion. It does net involve con»
centration or contemplation.
The correct practice of the
technique involves no effort.
Herein lies the beauty of
transcendental meditation, it
is natural.

In his commentary on the
Bhagavad~ Gita, Maharishi
Mahosh Yogi says that “the
technique may be defined as
turning the attention inwards
towards the subtler levels of
a thought until themindtrans-
ccnds the experience of the
subtlest state of the thought
and arrives at the source of
the thought. This expands the
conscious lnind and at the
same time brings it in contact
with the creative intclligence
that gives rise to every thOU’
ght.

It should be noted thattrans~
cendental meditation is nei~
that a matter of contempla-
tion nor of concentration. The
process of contemplation and
concentration both hold the
mind on the conscious thinke

mg level, whereas transcen-

dental meditation systematic
ally takes the mind to the
source of thought, the pure
field ofcreative intelligence."
The benefits gained by the
regular practice of transcen-
dental meditation, two 15 to
20 minute periods daily, in-
clude more energy, creative
intelligence and happiness.
The greater energy enjoyed
by meditators can be under-
stood scientifically.

"Oh, but life goes on and on

I'll survive." So, you thin
you've written a great son
and you want to make a few
bucks by recording a single.
Before proceeding any fur
ther, listen to the new album
by the Kinks, “Lola Versus
Powerman and the Moneygo-
round, Part One." You remr
ember the Kinks: "Well Rese
pected Man", "Just Like Me"
and other such pleasant nos*
talgia. During the latter part
of the Sixties, they slithered
into oblivion. And now, 1971,
they reappear with a brand
new album, making sure that
everyone knows they’re back
by cutting a single from the
album, titled, of course,
"Lola,"

Can Ray Davies' Kinks make
it in the blistering Seventies?
Surprisingly, yesl Their new
album is, simply, a very good
album. The music is light,
original, and often just fun to
listen to. Briefly, the album
tells the story ofa rockgroup
who record a hit single.

The first song, ”The Con-
tender", is aplea for success.
“I don’t want to be like a fas-
cist dictator/a saint or a sine
ner, I want to be a winner."

The technique can belcamed
in four one and a half hour
sessions of instruction by a
qualified teacher of transccn
dental meditation. Mr. Charlie
Donah‘ue will be giving two

Thursday, April 1, at [land

room 171. The lectures are
free. Come learn more about

the moneygoround/I onlyhop E‘Lola" does not fit into the

ctual story; rather, it is the

ong which the group records
to become a big hit. Davies
never tells us whether Lola is
a man or a transvestllt". The
line, ”Well I'mnOt the world's
most masculine man/But I
know what I am and I’m glad
I'm a man/And so is Lola."
can be read either way.

Well, "Lola" makes ll to
Number 1, the "Top of the
Pops". But all the money is
on the "Moneygoround" H
(quoted at the beginning of
this article.) By the time (110
money is given to various pubn
lishers, technicians,and other
nethings on themoneygoi‘ound,
nothing is left for the perfor
mers.

Nothing more of profound inn
terest can really be saidnbout
this album. There are other
good songs, such as “\ Long
Way From Home", a beautiful
Davies’ ballad; and "Apes
man", which sounds like a
carbomcopy of “Lola." How-
ever, I must say again that
this is a very good album.
There is really not much ar-
ound that isworth buyingthese
days. If you have a few dollars
you feel like spending, pick up
a copy of Lola . . .; you’ll be
pleasantly surprised.
