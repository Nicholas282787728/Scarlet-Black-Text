leggett Tells Academic Restructuring Plan

To: the College community
From: Pres. Glenn Leggett
The following proposal is one
I hope will have enough support
from the faculty and student
body so that i can present it
for information and approval
at the April meeting of the
Board of Trustees. Substane
tively, the proposal has two
parts: (1) a recommendation
for a divisional reorganization
to be effective September 1,
1971, and (2) a recommenda-
tion to modify the operating
procedures of the Executive
Council so that students may
be involved directly in educae
tional policy determination as
early as March 1 of thisyear.
The first part, which is mostly
an attempt to improve opera-
tional efficiencies, will rem
quire approval from both the
faculty and the Board 0fTrus*
tees. The second part, which
impinges directly on lntellee
tual (and emotional) convicr
tions, should have at least inn
formal consensus on the part
of the Grinnell teaching and
student community. Though I
have devised the operational
procedures of the second part
to fit the firstpart, the second

is really not substantively d5,
pendent on the first. The es-
sential idea of the second
could be realized under our
present divisional arrange-
ments. Accordingly, it may
be thought desirable to sep-
arate the two parts in faculty
and student discussions.
Some remarks about why I
have decided to make this
particular proposal are per-
tinent. Early last fall I began
to organize in “governing p0,
licy" language my thoughts
about a rather complete rem
organization of the College’s
structures for academic de»
cisionemaking’. I had felt for
some time that a way should
be found to incorporate stud—
ents formally into educational
policy determinations. In
addition, I was dissatisfied
with the divisional arranges
ment, particularly for two
reason ' (I) the large size of
the humanities division made
it difficult for its divisional
chairman to regard himself
as truly representative, and
(2) there was an isolationist
quality in the special division
in which the departments of
Education and Physical Edur

cation found themselves. Ifelt
too that the members of the
Executive Council, in being
forced to deal as a totalgroup
with all personnel and most
educational policy questions,

as well as with general col-

lege matters, had too full an
agenda to be as effective as
they might be. At the same
time, I wanted an academic
structure that preserved the
responsibility of the faculty
for making the final judgment
(prior to the President's and
the Trustees' approval or
disapproval) on issuesinvolv-
ing faculty personnel and the
basic educational direction of
the College.

In developing a description of
such a reorganization I faced
several problems. There was
not only the problem ofbring-
ing into a coherent structure
the convictions I just ex-
pressed above, but also the
problem of making sure that
the language of my intentions
was clear andaccurate. These
were composition problems
and could be resolved by ask-
ing persons to read and dis-
cuss various drafts with me.
But at least as important was

HavemanRapsECQnomicPolicy

by Debbie McKnight
This semester's series of
visiting lecturers got off to a
promising start lastThursday
when Robert Haveman spoke
“er D.C. Policy Makers
and Economic Analysis." A
Grinnell faculty member be
fore 1968, Haveman spent two
years on Congress'JointEcoe
nomic Committee and is now
at the UniversityofWisconsin.
A large audience of students
and faculty turned out for what
Haveman promised would be

“rather cynical remarks."
He contended that more fre-
quent use of objective econe
omic analysis would promote
efficiency and fairness in fed
eral appropriations. Haven
man's experience with gov-
ernment has convinced him
that our political system re-
lies heavily on what he called
the “conflict avoidance mech-
anism," which works against

such efficiency and equity.
Because it is ”a near catas~
trophe for a legislator when
he must publicly take a posi-
tion which will alienate some
group, Haveman said, "most
Congressmen do all they can
to avoid taking any strong
stand."

Especially in the case offed-
eral spending, lhismechanism
makes legislators “impose
costs covertly, over a large
number of people and not over
any identifiablepower group."
Haveman illustrated this point
with the government's res-
ponse to water pollution. It
would be politically danger-
ous to fine industries for
waste emission, but neither
can the government risk giv-
ing direct subsidies to busie
ness for pollution control. So
Congress skirts the issue by
aiding municipal waste treat
ment plants. Suchaction relies

on public ignorance of the fact
that most municipalwaterpol-
lution is due to industrial, not
human waste. The federal gov-
ernment pays cities to clean
up after business. Only theun-
organized, powerless, indivi-
dual taxpayers lose.

Federal programs are also
prevented from receiving ob-
jective consideration because
of what Haveman called
"structural interest group
bias" within committees. Frr
eshmen legislators are as-
signed to committees by their
party leaders. Thepartylead-
ers put the man where he will
have the best chance to work
for his own re-election. A
senator from Wyoming may
be put on publicworks. There,
instead of looking at the suit-
ability of various irrigation
programs, he only works for
whatever will bring the most
money to Wyoming.

Congress' self-centered ore
ientatlon is implemented by
executive secrecy. ”The fed
eral budget," declared Have-
man, “is impossible toundere

career of understanding It."

the procedural problem ofhow
to present the propOsal for
reorganization to faculty and
students. I had hopes that I
could meet with smallgroups,
then incorporate into re—
visions of the proposal as
many of their suggestions as
I thought pertinent, and so
proceed step by step to those
ultimate bodies, the faculty
and the students. ldid have
conversations with theExecu-
tive Council, with the Faculty
Organization Committee and
with the executive cabinet of
lhe Student Government Ase
sociation. The differences
within and among the groups
were too great for me to ten
solve within terms of my orie
ginal plans, which includednot

College Senate, and a con-
comitant elimination of divis-
ional Edumtional Policy Com~
mitteES.

While these discussions were
going on, half the year was
coming to a close, the faculty
had gone through a prOtracted
debate on the requirements
issue which postponed other
matters, and rumors of what-
is , the , president‘s - propo-
sal , why - doesn’t - he- let -

January 1, taking everything
into account, I felt that any"
proposal lmadewouldhave the
best chance ofbecomingoper-
able for next year if it were
frankly designed as experi-
mental and could get consid-
eration from the total college
