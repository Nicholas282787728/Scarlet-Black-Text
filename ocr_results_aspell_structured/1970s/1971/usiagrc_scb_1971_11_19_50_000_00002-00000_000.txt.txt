Tells Phase H Uncertaini)’ Sear liCommmeeMeeis

by John Wylie

President Glenn Leggett is become
ing increasingly concerned with the
effects on the college of the lack of
a definitive Phase II policy onwages
and prices. Leggett discussed his
concern with the 5&8 in an inter-
View Friday alternoon.

The President reflected on the fu-
ture oi the college. Hisflrst concern
is the raises whichthe faculty, under
their current contracts, are entitled
to but have been unable to receive
due to the Wage-Price freeze. Leg~
gett sent a letter to the faculty on
November 9 indicating that it might
be possible to petition the Council
on Wages and Prices forpermission
to pay the raises retroactively He
has remained in close touch with the
college’s attorneys, and indicates
that he is eager to pay the raises.
“The money is in the budget andl
feel the faculty is entitled to the
raises. We want to pay these raises
just as soon as our counsel gives us
the go ahead.”

or even greater concern to Leg-
gett are the indications that Under
Phase ll, wages may be allowed to
rise more than twice as much as
prices. To the college, this would
mean pressure to raise laculty sa
aries more than it could raise tu

tion to cover the raises. Under the
terms of the guidelines which have
been discussed solar, which provide
for price increases no greater than

2.5% and wage increases of up to
5.6%, the college would obviously be
placed in an untenable position.

“It isn’t like a business”, Leggett
commented. “A business can grant
raise its prices 1% and still be
ahead, because it can often increase
productivity, But how can a college
increase productivity? We’re edur
cating students .and that requires
certain expenditures that will con»
tinue to rise, not decrease."

Leggett sees problems in in-
creasing the student body to raise
additional revenue. "It isn’t reallya
problem of size We can convert
some of the Park Street residences
to student housing Without too much
difficulty. But I’m not sure we can
attract, say, thirty new students to
the college under our present ad-
missions procedures and fixed fi-
nancial aid budget."

Although the first Semester is not
completed, work on the budget lor
19724973 is well under way. Dean
of Administration Waldo Walker has
roughly outlined expenditures...but
is stymied at the moment by the
indecision on Phase II. “Dean

Using a comparative slide approach
and an extremely entertaining luw~
key manner, Dean Joseph Wall lec»
tured last Monday before a large
gathering in Roberts Theatre on the
architecture of Grinnell. The basic
subject of the lecture was what hap-
pens to styles developed in Europe
and the East Coast when they are
transplanted into the ”hinterlands",
that being the plains of central Iowa
upon which Grinnell was con-
structed.

Beginning with the first structure
back in 1854, a building of dubious
appearance and termed by Wall as
”Grinnell's first coved dormitory,”
he traced various styles reﬂected in
Grinnell's architecture. Examples
of important developments were the
use of wooden ornament, later
wrought iron, the Greek classic re»
vival, and the use of the cuppola.
Wall also mentioned the work of
important American architects,
most notably Henry Hobson Richard-
son and Louis Sullivan.

In Richardson's work he found the
only relation in architecture of the
East Coast that could pertain in any
way to the highly entertaining and

brought an enthusiastic reaction
from the audience, the only applause
prior to the conclusion, It is fin»
portant for the college, Wall stated.
that it set an example for the town
in maintaining its architectural her-
itage.

Wall also gave a very entertaining
theory on Louis Sullivan and the
small town banks, ofwhich the Power
shiek County National Bank is afine
example Termlng Sullivan's banks
satires on wealth and banking in
general, he found various aspects of
the bank as pointing to this satire.

Dean Wall concluded the lecture
with a look at today, noting that
Skidmore, Ovungs, and Merrill, the
firm that has done the recent Grin»
nell buildings and is one of the best
firms in architecture today. Healso
found time to Christen the building
on the southeast corner of 4th and
Broad "perhaps the ugliest building
in America."

Entertainment and education were
in pertect harmony as Dean Wall
presented this appraisal of the di—
verse and interesting Grinhell arch-
itectural scene.

Walker can’t do anything, at least
on the income side ot the budget,
until we can decide onatuition raise
tor next year.”

Timing is important for several
reasons. First, students will begin
to be accepted under the “Early
Decision“ plan in December, and
“it is not a good policy for us to
have to tell them ‘We can't tell you
exactly how much it is going to
cost’ ” In addition, the budget is
scheduled for presentation to the
Executive Committee of the Board
of Trustees of the college at their
January meeting, and it will take
some time before that to get the
budget into final shape.

Leggett concluded, “I had thought
that surely by today we would havea
concrete policy to work under. lcan
only hope that we will have a firm
statement by the Cost or Living
Council in the near i‘uture...but the
headlines 0f the last few days have
certainly not been encouraging."

Board Finds Mystery Fuind, Maybe

by Sue Lindsey

A discussion olproposed recipients
for the proceeds from the SAGA fast,
action on a report from the Finance
Committee, and a discussion of
“academic pressure” as surveyed
by Phil Sasich occupied the CofHPr
AWS Joint Board for most of its two
hour meeting Tuesday night.

Proposed recipients of SAGA fast
money include East Pakistani Refur
gees. Another suggested recipient is
Weliare Boy's Town in Pusan,
Korea. Shelley Floyd has read lete
ters typed by theI boys themselves
requesting help, since the cropfailr
lire has created quite a problem for
them this year. Shelley also received
a letter from UNICEF. They are cone
corned about US contributions tolhe
UN and how a cutback would affect
organization like UNICEF. They also
requested that Grinnell students
write letters to Congress asking that
aid not be cut.

Yvor Stoakly spoke on behall olthe
Foreign Student Board. This year
the board was unableto bring any new
foreign students to Grinnell who
could not otherwise afford to. The
pop machines are not yielding as
much profit since the change to hot
tles. it was also suggested that the
money might be used to send a stu
dent as representative to the Associr
ation of World Colleges and Univerr
sities Conference this January in
Denmark. The cost would be about
$350. The Soledad Brothers Defence
Fund was also considered, but was
considered too political a move.

Discussion on the Foreign Stur
dent Board’s request was lengthy
and involved. Phil Sasich movedthat
the board receive the money, It was
seconded. Loren Hart mentioned,
however, the existence of a myster—
ious $6,000 savings account for the
board. Apparently no one is sure it
exists, but the Finance Committee
receives interest on it. Carolyn
hshbaugh suggestedthat money from
the plnball machines be given to the
board. It was decided to check into
both the mysterious $6,000 savings

Finance Committee chairman
George Shyhllt reported to the board
regarding the allocation oi various
odd Soil lunds The following were
passed by the Joint Board. l-lis com
mittee suggested that $57.11 lelt
in the Foreign News accountbe used
to buy subscriptions to the London
Times and the New York Times
for the Forum, to be later donated
to the library; that $250 from the
now inactive Young Dems and Young
Reps, originally from the Sloan
Foundation, be given to the PPPE's
speaker's fund, that $23 trom a
previous Student book coop, leg‘ally
belonging to SOA, be given to the
SGA supply limit, and that a stand~
ing member or the Finance Com
mittee be present in a non~votlng
capacity in meetings of those coins
mittees receiving money. The folr
lowing suggestions are to be con
sidered next week that money be
given to ball funds and t0 the 1972

operating; that a bill lrom the 1969
Cyclone be paid irom oBbR rather

budget lor public events
Phil Sasich began the discussion
about “academic pressure" bytell-
ing about the disbelier on the part
oi various pr-olessors that such
pressure exists onorinnell campus.
Phil decided to run a survey in his
hall. It involved on out of 95 people
in Loose. He lcels Loose is lairly
representative since it is so large
and coed. The lost question cone
cerned how many hours the student
spent studying encli tiny. The aver-
age was ss hours per day, with
35% studying lorB-thours,another
third for 6 hours and another third
below 475 hours

The search committee was lormed
alter numerous complaints that
there is a lack at orinuellolproe

college had no black faculty mem

which appeared in last weeks 5&5

with the Search committee's list of

if they had noticed an increase in
the load. About 75% replied yes, and
half of them thought it was due to
either upper level courses or more
diligence on their part. About 50%
said they were not able to keep up
with their work, and several more
were barely managing. 75% of the
upperclassmen had pulled an avere

garding the use of speed. one half
either had used or planned to use
speed. or those, the overage num—
ber of hits was 7 for both fresh-
men and upperclassmen. Three
freshmen had each used 25 hits of
speed, one had used 30, Eight
upperclassmen had used 16 hits
each, with I having used 30 also. To
quote Phil, ”1 consider these pretty
freaky statistics.” .

In the discussion that followed,
most of the house presidents spoke
of an unusual numberofpeople com—
ing to them really mixed up with so
much work. The RA’S seem to be
getting pretty much the same res-
ponse. Since talking to the prots
as representatives of the Joint Board
has not been very ellective, it was
suggested that the students theme
selves get together and go talk to
the teachers responsible.

Carolyn Ashbaugh, from the Li-
brary Committee, had several sug—
gestions about the future use of the
rooms the administration will soon
vacate. The general concensus was
that it would be a good idea to bring
the periodicals from downtown and
put them there. she also suggested
that students be allowed to take
magazmes out for a week rather than
one day. Donna Rothenburg made a
motion to that effect; it was seconded
and passed, The question of voting
without a quorum came up and was
dealt with very eltectively. It was
decided to take a vote on whether
voting is possible without a quorum
if no one calls for a quorum count
Shelley Floyd called for a vote on
the issue, but Loren Hart called for
a quorum count. The matter will be
on next week’s agenda.
