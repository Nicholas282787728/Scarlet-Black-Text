They’re off against Knox!

Wresilers Dynamic In Defeat!

Grinnell's wrestlers‘ still
have not won a dual meet in
three years, but a moral vic»
tory was registered against
Simpson. The final score read
26~12 in favor of the Redmen.
The Pioneers had to forfeit
15 points in the meet because
of lack numbers. After run-
ning over to the Stat Lab in
Carnegie, I have computed
that the actual mat score was
1211 Grinnell. The twelve
points are a season high as
four Wrestlers popped into the
win column.

Bob Donelan was impress»
ively victorious, 10—1. Wash-
ington Alston museled his way
to a 14—3 win followed by Don
Aldrich, the heavy, winning
his third Siralghtmatch,16‘5.

The fourth wrestler was a
normal human the week be
fore, and made his first ap-
pearance a happy affair. Ral-
eigh Buckmaster beat his ope
ponent 8%. Following Ral-
eigh’s route to instant wrest»

No luck

The SecondeHalfFade Syn-
drome took its toll again last
weekend. Grinnell dropped two
more in the final stanza, losr
ing at Knox 74, S8 and atMon-
mouth 7258, to run their Con-
ference record to 210.

Against Knox the Pioneers
were actually trailing by only
one free throw, at 31-30, at
the end of the front stanza,
but the Siwash came on in the
second half outscoring Grin»
nell 4348, to blow the Pione
eers out of the game. Grinnell
continued its neW‘found ways
of keeping the fouls down; they
actually outscored Knox by two
at the Free Strip. However,
our Hoopsters only fired at
a 37.5% clip from the field
while Knox canned 50%oftheir
field goal attempts as Grina

lership, Steve Hutchings and
Ernie Rose came out the fol-
lowing week to try to help

Coach Hunt to a victory by-

filling up the weight classes
somewhat. If there is a 118
pounder’ in the reading aud-
ience, your presence is re
quested.

Last Saturday the team res
verted to form as they lost
both ends of a double dual.
Central won 38-5 with Jim
Pursell winning on a forfeit.
Coe won 48st). Coe got 20
points in forfeits and Cen-
tral 15.

Last Wednesday, in the con-
fines of Darby Gym, the grap-
piers took on William Penn.
it is quite possible that a win
is in the air. Washington Al-
ston is dropping weight to
177, so that he can wrestle
guys more his size. lfforfeits
do not get the team, the team
could get a big lift for con-
ference.

THE SCARLET AND BLACK

February 26, 1971

A'Jocks Swamped, NolL Sunk!

The Grinnell Super-Stars,
the swim team, won a bitty
and losta biggie. Mauling Knox
on Thursday, 69-35, the
guppies got guttered at Rock
Island Illinois by Augustana
110 to 98. The Augiemeetwas
called ”The Viking Olympics
and was a quadrangular. Tho
erefore all was not lost as the
boys beat Rockford College,
88, and Loras 22.

Against Knox, the star was
Steve Ward, (Gabby), who sm-
ashed the pool record in the
160 IM. He approvingiynodded
his head as his favorite friend
applauded in theaudience. The
favorite friend of Lawrence
Huntoon wasnot there andpro~
bably for the better, as Ponv
toon set a school record in
the diving but lost to a nobody
named Wright. Larry alsohad
to pay Hines for watering his
rats. Larry is also taking up
knitting to calm his nerves.
Let's hear it for Iarry.

At the Olympics, Gabby was
the only possible star, if you
can single one out (or distin-
ction. Gabriel set an Olympic
record in the 100 freestyle
with a 50.5. This is now the
best time in the conference in
the event. Gabby also was a
big factor in the 400 freerelay
that is now the possessor of
the iastest time in the confer-
ence by 5 seconds. Other trir
vial members of the relay
were Mike Daley, Jim Cams,
and Rollins.

The reason for the loss at
Augustana was that "they
dune been hadl" Now diving
is a judgment where the coa—
ches sit around and guess at

Again For B-Bull Team

nell continued to combine a
poor offense with a clean
game.

Against Monmouth, Grinnell
went back to its early season
form of losing games at the
Charity Stripe. In spite ofan
even poorer offense here than
at Knox (the Pioneers only
potted 37.1% of their shots),
they were outscored from the
field by only two buckets.
They gave away the other 10
points at the free throw line,
scoring 12 and giving away
22. They did manage to stay
close in the first half, but the
steady stream of gift shots
that Monmouth enjoyed en~
abied them to pull away in the
second half.

may remember, beat Grinnell
badly the last time out, as the
Pioneers were coming off the
brawl with the Rednecks of
Ripon. The important thing of
this weekend, however, is that
Ripon must stay in our dorm
for awhile. It seems that one
of the causes of the donneye
brook at Ripon was that, dur~
ing die game, their coach
came over to the Grinnell
bench and said something to
the effect thatour Hippiesplay
as dirty as they look. I say
that just hemuse they're all
gay blades doesn’t mean we
have to use razors. There-
fore, rise up Friday, Grinnell

With three weeks left in has
ketball season, Clark, at 6-0,
seems to be a good pick towin
the crown. They easily disr
posed of the Profs 64-45, and
hang only Haines between them
and the championship. Haines,
meanwhile, handily disposed
of Loose to run their record to
5-1. Smith beat borh teams of
the Profs, and now stand 61.
They have yet to play OC,
Haines, and Loose, who is yet
to win a game. Cowies had to
battle Loose into double over
time to beat the hapless crew
from South Campus.
