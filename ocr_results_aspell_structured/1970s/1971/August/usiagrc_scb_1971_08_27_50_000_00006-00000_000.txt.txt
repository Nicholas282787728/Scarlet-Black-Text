S 8. B Interviews Grinnell RA’s

Resident advisors will be liv*
ing in seven locations around
campus this year. This re-
presents a decrease by two in
the number of filled resident
advisor suites. The S & E
has interviewed all of the Re
sident Advisors, with a view
to providing students with
more of a personal introdutr
tion to them thanwouldbe pos-
sible by examining their vits
ae.

jim Tederman, promoted to
assistant Dean this year, was
a Resident Advisor last year;
the S & B asked him to bri-
efly describe the role of the
Resident Advisor.

Four principal functions
make up the Resident Advi'
sor's job, according to Ted-
erman. Counseling of stu-
dents is the first he listed;
Resident Advisors will work
closely with student advisers
in their halls, and they will
be involved with both the Menr
tal Health Center and Revolv-
ing Door.

"The Resident Advisor
should take a facilitating role
in hall government, givingad—
vice on how to get things
done - thus acting primarily
as a resource person,” says
Tederman. Tederman did in-
dicate that the Resident Ad~
visors should take an active
role in planning events for
the hall, encouraging activi-
ties which they think would
be worthwhile or interesting.
In part, Tederman sees the
Resident Advisors' role to be
that of "graduate student in
residence", an Interestingadr
dition to a college campus that
does not abound in graduate
students.
We of last year's Resident
Advisers have returned, Ro-
semary Ash, who will be liv-
in in Main Hall, and Prue
dence Milite, who is assigned
to Gates Hall.

Rosemary Ash returned to
Grinnell this yearbecause she
found the job "interesting”
last year, and bemuse she
enjoys the fact that her job
permits her to ”have as much
contact with st'udents as the
students and 1 want, because
there are very few adminisn
trative details to get in the
way." She likes the fact that
she can structure her day as
required and does not have to
follow a set routine each day.

She finds it "very plea'
surable" to workwith students
and likes the informality of
Grinnell life.

Rosemary's hobbies include
reading, classical music and
opera, and Italian -- she once
lived in a small town near
Florence, Italy, on a special
summer program and still
corresponds with the family
with whom she lived. ”Mo-
stly, I enjoy spending my le ,
suretime with students and Ot’
her people; I like activities
that involve contact with peo-

Prudence Milite returned to
Grinnell because she "liked
to be able to do a variety of
counseling." Sh helped run
the career s’erv'_ soffi'ce last
year, in addition to organizing
a Trgroup (a sort ofmarathon
group-counseling session)and
carrying out the counseling
necessary indayrturday dor-
mitory life.

Her hobbies include fishing
and camping; she spentpart of
her summer backpacking inup
smte New York and at the
Mt. Lassen National Park in
California. She likes to write
poetry occasionally, and her
favorite kinds of music are
Jazz Blues and Classical.

Before coming to Grinnell,
Prudence worked for the Nan
tional Council of Churches
in a frustrating attempt to get
that organization to provide
financial backing to various
groups in deprived areas. She
originally mme to Grinnell to
gain experience in counseling,
since she plans to make a ca-
reer in that area.

Paul Braun is a new Resi-
dent Advisor, assigned to
Clark Hall. He came to Gri-
nnell, from Indiana Uni-
versity, where he was a Re
sident Asst., because he was
attracted by the size of the
school. This will be his ﬁfth
year working in resident
halls. ”I am impressed by
die friendliness of people I’ve
met at Grinnell,” "and it
seems possible here for an
indIVidual to know a great
many of the students on came

pus."

Paul’s outside interest (sic)
is sports. He likes snow skin
ing, water skiing, baseball,
softball, football. Healsoputr
ters around with the tools
contained in the large toolbox
he was last seen carrying.
The new Resident Advi»
sor assigned to Langan Hall
is William (Will) Wilson, Jr.
He comes from the University
of California; while there he
worked for a time with the
Santa Barbara Probation De
partment and was a counselor
at the Lampoc Federal Corr

Schwubs

rectional Facility. Sincehe is
interested in counseling coll'
age level students for a car-
eer, Will expects to benefit
from,experience,,in an,area of
counseling new to him.

His hobbies and interests
are numerous. Once a pro-
fessional jazz musicianrrhe
played conga druerrWilson
naturally likes music, especi-
ally soul. He is a rated chess
player, and rumor has it that
he once beat the state champs
ion of California in a match.
Photography, horseback ride
ing, jogging, travelling, and
writing poetry are some of
his other interests. Lastyear
he visited Europe and Nora
them Africa. Since he is
considering writing his own
biography, there is no point
in the S & B's trying to do
a more complete job than

Assigned to Haines Hall is
Gary Rasmussen, who re-
Cently finished an MA in Gui-
dance and wanted to get some
experience “to find out wher
ther I want to continue in the
counseling field." Also, this
job gives Gary a chance to
leave the state of California
and live in the Midwest for
awhile.

Gary's primaryhobby is \vrir
ting, an area he took up only
after he had an undergraduate
degree in sociology. He once
collaborated on a piece for
television and has written sea
veral short stories, his ia-
vorite literary forml He has
written a film script, which
he was unable to sell, and has
acted in a few one act plays.
One of the most shocking e -
periences in his life was (Ils-
covering that most of the Hole
lywood stereotypes, which he
had read about all his life,
WEIe true. This he discover-
ed while living in Hollywood,
He lived in Denmark for six
and one half months, and has
many interesting experiences
to share about his trip.

Allen Schwab is our Resin
dent “dissertationwriting”

working on an English PhD”
and with his wife Phyllis will
be sharing the RA suite 1“
the Younkeirs, Allen has had
n‘o professional training in C0’
unseling, but he hasworkedas

a residence hall advisorstaff
member for several years.

Besides English, Schwab's
interests include classical
music, especially Mahler
symphonies. As a graduate
student, he once taught an in
terdisciplinary course in R0-
mantic Music and Romantic
Literature. A theatre ham,
Allen may try to encourage one
of the halls to put on a read
er's theatre production. (It
is rumored that he once playr
ed the part of Scrooge in a
production of' "A Christmas
Carol" by Charles Dickens.)
Phyllis shares his interest in
music.

Paul and Pam Wrightman
travelled most of this past
summer, after being married
on June 5. Both like to back-
pack; they also share a strong
interest in non-violence. Paul
says that he has spent two
years working on a project
concerning the development of

Friday, August 27, 1971
nonrviolence in JudedChrist-
inn thought. Pam taught high
school the past two years, in
California, where her subject
areas were psychology and
philosophy. Paul enjoys paint-
ing.

The Wrightman’s came to
Grinnell partly ”to get a vi-
carious experience of being a
student at a small college."
Pam is interested in Working
With college age people, since
she may want to make a car-
eer of working with that age
group.

fall option, and grading.

Under the criteria now es*
tablished for practim or co-
ciirricular credit, credit could
easily be expanded to many
activities ofi campus. Wall
asked the faculty to consider
the desirability of this.

\lso, when very large num-
bers and proportiona of SIU’
dents stop going to graduate
school from Grinnell, Wall
said, “then we cannot so eas-
ily avoid our career respon-
sibility as in the past.”

With regard to credit-fail
and independent projects,
Dean Wall’s suggestions para-
lleled those of Mr. Clotfelter.

”There is a very real dan-
ger to our students under the
present creditrfail system",
Wall said, ”as long as We
allow a D grade to be counted
for credit."

independent projects present
a problem, according to Dean
Wall, because there are not
enough standards to insure
the quality of the project, and
because indcpendents are ova
erloads for the faculty. Last
semester, of approximately
3700 separate course of-
ferings, almost 10% were ins
dependents.

One possible restriction on
independents, Dean Wallmerr
tioned, is a restriction on
the number of independents a
student can take; currently,
the only restriction applies to
the number of credits of in—
dependent study taken in one
department.

Dean Wall also encouraged
a discussion of alternatives
to the present grading system,
and he said that fairly ”swee-
ping" alternatives may be
considered.
