Unique Moni

by a staff writer

There have been numerous
whisperings surrounding the
new belle of Grinnell this
semester. It is not too diffi-
cult to notice, hardas one may
try, the neW‘found gusto in
the eyes of inquiring "aspirt
ants". Maybe finalement, this
is what the college needs. New
inspiration! Who is this mys-
terious redrhead, who Whisks
in and out of the Forum, leav-
ing an unmistakable scent of
Chanel numero cinq'.7

“Really, I am a very shy
person,” says Monique Carr
don, nouvelle assistant to the
French Department, and wel-
come addition to La Maison
Francaise. She is an Ameria
can Studies major at the Uni-
versity of Nice, France. “I
study English and American

literature, American Civili-
zation, phonetics and Spanish,
and plan to go into the tourist
industry." Of course, we are
all interested to lu-lowher first
impressions of Grinnell. "It
was very difficult the first day
to understand people, espec»
ially when they were speak-
ing together. It was very u
eh v penible -- painful forme
not to understand. Now it be-
comes easier. 1 can under-
stand.” Naturally in thelreag-
emess to practice speaking
French with her, the people
here forget that she would
also like to practice her Eng‘
lish. In Grinnell, Monique ap-
preciates "the smallness, the
quietness, the snow, it is very
different from whereicome."
She found the general ambient

Calendar Plan Disadvantages

ents are more easily excited
about issues in the spring.
Whether or not it is an ad
vantage to avoid this potential
excitement is debatable.

Point 5 could also be stated
as follows: A later terminal
date is often of great conven-
ience to parents who have
children in Other schools.
Thus point 5 can hardly be
an overwhelming advantage.

The first disadvantage cited
by the Committee isnotstated
as strongly as it could be.
The hardship on the biology
classes basically means that
these students will get very
little of the field work that is
integrally involved with their
classes. Field classes taught
in the spring are not readily
adaptable to thefallsemester.
The calendar change could
also drastically affect those

independents that are field
oriented. (14 studentsare cur-
rently doing such independent
projects). The biology stud»
cuts are a minority on the
campus, but the fact that the
proposed change would alter
the quality of education in the
biology department should
matter to the whole campus
community.

Another important disadvarr
tage not cited by the Commit-
tee is the fact that students
(and I imagine faculty) get
very depressed during the
winter at Grinnell. Addingarr
other week to this would not
do much for student’s overall
mental state which naturally
affects their ability to get
anything out ofaoademics. 01
the other hand, spring here is
delightful and a positive force
in mental attitudes.

The choicelas to whether-1o.

change the calendar seems to
be one of convenience versus
academics.

There will be a student opin'
ion poll concerningthis issue
Monday in the lunch lines.

of the people much freer, less
superficial than in France.
"Of course, this Is maybe
just a first impression. "
Monique loves to “(Hire du
ski," and is interested in Mad
ern Dance, films and classical
music. She doesn't lcnit.

Little by little, the generally
icnown stereotype of zee
French nationality is breaking
down. For example, the other
night a group was messing
around discussing the pOssi-
bilities of obtaining wine
gratis for a fondue party at
Pine Tree (behind Cleveland,
for the curious). "Winel? I
don‘t like winel" said
Monique. A general silence
ensued, until at last, no longer
able to contain her surprise,
one of the Americans asked
her, “What do you drink at
meals then?" it was a very
matter-OPEC! answer that
shoeked themall. ”Why, Coke,

Mayrent, the co‘op didn't
really get started until Sep-
tember of this school yearbe»
cause of the need for student
help.

The co-op provides super-

a relaxed, informal atmosc

Uncle Sam’s Club

Uncle Sam's Club is a re»
creational club for [own child-
ren staffed by Grinnell Col-
lege student volunteers. Tw-
enty‘one students have signed
up to work this semester,
according to Johanna Ward,
who supervises volunteers.

Uncle Sam's Clubhas a meet
ing house at Third and Pearl
Streets equipped with pop and
ping pong tables, a jukebox, a
television, a piano, arts and
crafts supplies and wrestling
mats. The club is open after-
noons and evenings Monday
through Thursday. The club
has a Director, Mrs. Robert
Thomazin, who is employed
by the town or Grinnell Re-
creation Department. The club
receives money from the Uni-
ted Fund and is free to child-
ren.

Volunteers plan arts and
grafts activities, supervise
volleyball games andplay with
the children. Johanna says
that, if you're a volunteer you
do your own thing. The clubis
unstructured and she says she
“is trying to get it a little
more structured." Johanna
said she would like to get the
college wrestling team to work
with the children.

The club, she says,isaplace
for children to go and meet
their friends. Started in i902
by two Grinnell students,
Uncle Sam's Club is the old-
est volunteer program on
campus.

Volunteers generally workin
groups of three. Johanna says
that the club could definitely
use more volunteers. Volun-
teers are taken at the begin
ning of each semester. Stud-
ents become volunteers by
contacting Johanna.

VISTA

Two VISTA volunteers, Kathy
Campbell and Leslie Lind-
stromberg, have organized a
big brother and big sister
program for town children

and college students. Accord-
ing to Leslie, approximately
forty college students have
volunteered to be bigbrothers
or big sisters to eighty childr
ren attending public schools.

She says that the program
will pair students with child-
ren who need individualatten-
tion and do no: receive it from
their parents. Children in
public elementary and junior
high schools who need a relaa
tionship with an older person
are referred to the program
by teachers and principals.

Leslie says that theprogram
gives students a chance to
work with a child on a one-
to-one basis and provide the
child with someone to talkarld
listen to and play with. Leslie '
saw the need for such rela-
tionships for children and got
the idea for a big brother
big sister program while
working as a volunteer at
Uncle Sam's Club.

She states that she still needs
more volunteers. Students join
the staff by calling her at
