The incredible Grinneil re-
commendation is rivalled in
enjoyment value by the roast-
ing that is given Carlton. I
cannot begin to describe it,
except to say thatldidn't know
that they admitted either nuns
or bovines into the Carlton
student body.

In any case, the Yale book
is worth $1.95 just to read
those two descriptions and
to bask in the glow that you
will derive from them. Ben
sides, you can send the book
home when your finished and
reassure your folks that their
money is wellrinvested. And
those Yalies do need your
money to buy the rest of the
smte of Connecticut. I think
Mr. McBee has a copy or two
in the bookstore.

.Ieong "A Man For All S

by Paula Speliz

All of us at some time have
been influenced by rumor, Ed
Leong, R. A. in Clark admit-
ted that word of mouth was in»
deed his first contact with
Grinnell College. It seems
that while Ed was attending
Yale Divinity School he fell
prey to a conversation of a
Grinnell alumnus describing
his undergraduate school, a
midwestern institution with
a superior academic reputa'
tion. Because Ed “wanted to
experience what it was like to
live at an American liberal
arts college and also wanted
to understand somethingofthc
American educational SyS’
tem," he applied for the R.A.
program at Grinnell and was
accepted. Ed, a native of Hong
Kong, was educated in Aus-
tralia at the University ofNew
South Wales, where he recei-
ved a E.A. honors degree in
Psychology and then in 1967
mine to the U.S. and compler
ted work for his Bachelor of
Divinity degree at Yale.
Commenting on the American
school system, Ed said that
the American system was
much more flexible-ﬁt en-
courages the student to develr
op and seek his interests.
"The American school sys
tem is truly liberal arts."
Upon being asked how he view-
ed the Grinncll College stud»
ent, Ed said, ”I find Grinnell
students to be of very high
caliber both in academics and
in their status as human bet
ings." He also mentioned that
he was very impressed with
the abundance of “aesthetic
talent" possessed by the stu—
dent body as a whole. Beyond
recognizing the capabilities
of Grinnell students Ed ex
pressed concern over the
apathy and ambivalence of
Grinnell students as an acti—

With regard to his position
as an R. A. Ed said, “I fun'
ction as a fricndrra sort of
man for all seasons. I don’t
want to be defined in the sense

'of the RA. role. It's basic-

ally a kind of freerfloating
position in which one rises to
meet certain demands, doing
whatever is necessary. Obs
viously, I can'tmeetevcry dea
mand, but as a friend I can
only do the best thing for my
friend. There were guidelines
given for the job, but guide
lines generally fall down and

become useless. It demands
simply a situation and a res-
ponee."

Besides serving as R.A. for
Clarke, Cowles, and Dibble,
Ed also teaches a non-credit
photography course, is in-
volved with the Revolving
Door, and aids Denis Haas
in informal religious servir
ces. After this year offriendr
ship and learning with Grinr
nell College, Ed plans on re-
turning to Australia where he
will work on VOwtiOnaI plans
in either psychology or pas-
toral ministry.

Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Yer
ung have recorded single ale

in rock music which began..bums. NEil Young has made
sometime in the middle of last; the most, with After the Gold
year is going to continue for; rush being his best effort,
quite a while. 1970 was the; and one of the best albums of
year in which things began to; the year. Steven Stills also
quiet down. And 1970 was theEiielVeased his first solo album,

year that rock groups faded
into oblivion as solo artists
dominated the music scene.
Whether this change is a per
manent one remains to be
seen.

Groups started breaking up
when more and more of the
musicians found out they could
make good music on their own.
Of course, the Beatles were
headed for this late. John and
Paul were both excellent songs

writers, and the conflict of‘

two superegos was too much
to hold a group togEther. Not
to mention George, who found
out he could also write excel'
lent music. john’s first solo
album is musically a huge
success; Paul’s album of a
year ago sold many copies but
had very little to offer in the
way of serious music.
Buffalo Springfield was anr
Other group filled with
"superstars." Both Steven
Stills and Neil Young come
from Buffalo. They joined up
with Crosby and Nash to form
the supergroup, C,S,N&Y, but
this group was surely fated to
a small lifespan. There was
no way that four top-rated
musicians could last fora long
period of time in one group.
Although the group has not of
ficially “broken up", it is
doubtful that they will record
with each Other again. (They
do have a live album coming
out shortly, recorded a few
months ago.) From the break»
ups of various groups come
the solo artiSts, whichhas be-
come the trend of music in
the 70’s.

and while not as good as any
of Young's records, it has its
good moments. Both Crosby
and Nash have solo albums
waiting to be released.

The 70's introduced solo
artists who were not off—
springs of a group. James
Tayler was by far the best
solo performer of this new
age. His two albums were
both million sellers, and he
easily became the most wider
ly listened to performerﬂo V,
1970. (The rest of his famil
also have recorded solo a1-
bums, Livingston's probably
being the best of the "other
Taylers.”) Elton John, an
English singerrcomposer,
made it big in the States 10*
wards the end of lasr year,
and is continuing to prove
that he is one of the finest
performers to enter the music
world in quite a long while.
Rod Stewart is another great
soloist. While not as well
Icnown as Tayler or John, his
record Gasolene Alley is
becoming more andmore pope
ular. And speaking of rasping
voices, Joe Cocker was an-
0ther big starof197u, although
he (unfortunately) seems to
be fading. Dave Mason estab
lished himself as a pctentittl
"superstar" with his first
solo release. Even Ringo Starr
proved (to some) that he can
sing some pretty good Country
and Western.

Groups are not entirely dead.
Jefferson Airplane is still
widely played (although there
has been talk of the group dis-
banding permanently). And
there is no denying that The
Rolling Stones still are the
best rock group around. (Lis-
ten to Get Your Ya-Ya’s Oil.)
And there are The Who, and
Sly and the Family Stone. But
when you compare this with the
number of good groups some
two years ago, this is not
many. The oncoming of solo
artists parallels the youth
movement as it stands today.
The "Movement" has reached
its low point, as the level of
student apathy has grown con-
siderably since last May. We
can only guess whether rock
groups, like the audience they
perform for,ai'c dcad, or when
thcr they only lie dormant,
waiting for the explosion to
start them moving again.
