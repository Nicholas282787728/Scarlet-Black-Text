Brighter Future For Campus

A brighter future is in store for
Grinnell, thanks to the efforts of
the New Construction and Land
scaping Committee and their
campus lighting program. Two
examples, which have already
been installed, are located in
front of the post office and also
in front of Goodnow Hall. All
of the remaining 26 fixtures will
have the same globe-shaped den
Sign which provides the maximum
illumination with the minimum
glare.

Eight of the new lights are in the
P, E. Complex area, while the
other lights are in other similar

dark spots around campus, such
as the walk between Hurling Lie
brary and Mears, the Science
building area, and the walk near
Steiner. At the present, all of
the cement bases for the posts
have been laid and final install-
ment will be completed as soon
as the upper portions of the 26
fixtures are received. Mr. Pome-
rank, college Business Manager,
said that the final delivery is ex-
pected belore the end or Novem~
bar, and installation will then be
made as rapidly as the electri—
cians can handle it.

'Bioa’rd Peruses Pinball Profits

A proposal from Mr. Dawson oithe
Public Events Committee, aFinance
Committee Report, a discussion of
the uses or money from the pinball
machines, and a discussion of the
Tuesday night meeting on academic
pressure occupied Monday's meet-
ing ofthe Joint Board in South Lounge
at 9:00 pm

Mr. Dawson presented a proposal
lor the new Public Events program
to bring a more varied type of en-
tertainment to Grinnell campus
This would include such things as
theater groups, Orchestras, ballet,
etc, He suggested that $5000 could
be raised Irom Student and Admini»
stration Budgets, with another$1000
coming {rpm the general budget.
This would result in It $6500 cut in
the popular concerts lund, and a
$1500 cut in the Initiative Fund. The
general opinion was that it isagdcd
idea, but there weredoubts aboutthe
source of the money to finance the
program, Many tell that so much
money should not be taken from the
fund lor popular concerts. The lact
was brought up that the type or pro—
grams suggested would he the kind

What - No Transcripts For

by Craig Murphy

The rosyrcheeked women in the
outervutiice in Burling Easement
act as a reassuring symbol to the
often confused students who enter
the Registrar’s Office with queSr
tions. ”Actually neither the petir
tion for withdrawal or incomplete is
‘easler'; they really are dillerent
things." “You have until today to
get your application in, so run right
down and send it out, and don’t {or
get to put a stamp on the envelope.”
The motherly demeanor of one
secretary slipped last week in the
presence of a fearless SM! editor.
Checking out his ‘beat’ the editor
asked, "Is anything interestinghap-
pening here?” The secretary, think-
ing perhaps he had lost his way and
was on the wrong campus, announced
that if someone doesn't change the
grading system the freshman grades
wouldn’t be reported. The muckrak-
ing editor, sensing a small story
about the livelihood of an entire
class, sent a lreshman (of course)
reporter to investigate.

“Actually, the freshmen should not
fear, or hope, we'll lose their
grades,” explained the Registrar,

Course ProposalFormulalecl

Colorado College’s “one course at
a time" calendar idea may be pros
posed at Grinnell. Mr. Ronald J.
Kunz (Anthropology) indicated that
he was currently working on modi-
fying the Colorado program, and
would larinalize his proposal short-
ly after the Christmas holidays.

Under the Colorado College plan,
students take only one course at a
time, with each course lastingthree
and one half weeks. This allows each
student to take lour courses per se-
mester. Colorado’s program has
been running for a lull year, with
great success reported.

Mr. Kurtz's proposal would allow
the first semester of the academic
year at Grinnell to remain under
the traditional semester calendar.
This would allow for courses inarf,
languages, and some sciences, and
other disciplines which benefit from
the full semester of time allotted.

The second Semester would be set
aside for more intensive work in one
area, Kurtz points out that his pro'
gram would be a real boon for many
departments. “Say theAnthropology
Department wanted to give a course
in Timbuctoo. Well, under this pro-

gram, ii the money could be lound,
they could pick up tor three and a
half weeks and go."

Kurtz had hoped to present his pron
posal during lirst semester, but
pressure of his position on the Exe
cutive Council and at finding new
personnel for the deparment have
prevented him from spending the
necessary time on iormalizing his
plan. He has talked to some col—
leagues, and reports that their re
action is, on the whole, lavorable.

He is hopeful that the holidays will
allow him time to get caught up, and
that he will be able to produceafirm
proposal shortly alter vacation, He
urged students, laculty, or adminis-
trators interested in a proposal to
make the calendar more ﬂexible,
this way or another, to get in touch
with him.

Administrative difficulties in

implementing such a proposal are
bound to exist, Knrtz continued.
However, he indicated that many of
these would have been solved by
Colorado, and that the time between
acceptance and implementation here
would be ample for solving any ad,
ditional problems.

He saw no reason whylhe proposal,
il accepted during the spring se—
mester, could not be implemented
during the 1972-1973 academic year.

to be held in Roberts rather than in
Darby and a limited number of stu—
dents would be able to see them. It
was decided to wait and get Ed LEV
vine and Chip Shofstall to talk to the
Board about their feelings about the
suggested changes. Each hall presi—
dent will try to find out what general
opinion is toward an action of this
nature.

The Finance Committee report by
George Shybut included a suggestion
that $360 be taken from GBKzR and
be divided among the halls and coops
for study breaks during linals. It
was voted on and passed. George also
suggested that $100 be taken lrom
GBGLR for publication of the year-
book. Actual cost of publication is
32500, with photographers supplies
costing between $500800, and artist
supplies being about $300. The cost
of mailing, layout, etc. brings the
total budget to about $4000. Of this,
about $1100 wlll come from subr
scriptions, and hopelully $2000 will
come from advertising. Karen Auer»
bach moved that the additional $1000
be taken from GBcR with the Stlplk
lation that any extra money be re

Mr, Seller. Grinnell gradesarekepl
on legal size pieces of card, one for
each student. The grades are clacked
out by the computer in various col»
unins, indicating when the courses
were taken. In the corner ofthe card
the present grading system is
printed, making it quite simple for
another institution to read the photo-
graphed copies. Simple, that is,
disregarding the college seal which
makes it ollicial, and disregarding
the facI that few Grinnell students
have all their scores recorded under
the present system. To solve the
latter problem an enclosure, ex—
plaining the various gyrations otthe
grading system or the past lew years,
is included with the transcript.

The Registrar's Office has run out
of these cards and will have to re-
order new ones when it comes time
to record freshman scores. Mr.
Seller has delayed ordering as long
as possible in hopes that he will
catch the grading system after it
evolves another step. Present stu-
dent attitudes indicate that changes
are in store {or the system, butMr.
Seller is afraid that they won’t take
place until alter the firstofthe year.
This will mean that freshman tran~
scripts will require a second en-
closure, a waste of paper that could
be avoided if action on the grading
system were taken beiore the first

turned. The motion was carried.

Greg Sayre from the Forum Sub-
committee on Student Services re»
ported on the money received lrom
the pinball machines and plans {or
its use. There is now $1600 in the
fund. The committee is thinking
about using the money (or the pure
chase ol‘ at least one new projecter
for use in the South Lounge, new
records for the listening room, and
possibly an intercom for talking
from the listening room totheforum
desk. The question ol using other
funds alloted to the committee came
up, and no one knew exactly what was
available. It was decided to get a
report from Mrs. Hawk and the com—
mittee on the use of the other funds.
The matter will be dealt with next
semester,

The rough draft {or an outline to
be used in a discussion onacademic
pressure on Tuesday night was dis-
cussed. The generalimpressionwas
that it is a rather awkward time to
deal with the problem, out the only
time available. Karen Auerbach
moved that the outline be sent out.
The motion was carried.

Freshmen??

semester scores of the new class
have to be recorded,

The new record cards will be
ordered in the smallest number pos—
sible and may diller lrom the present
form even it the system is not
changed. Mr. Seller feels the present
cards are a little coniusing. They are
a bit like trying to decipher Sanskrit.
The Office will attempt to remedy
this.

In other action of the past week the
Registrar’s Office requested course
offerings of the second semester to
be sent to them by the various de—
partments, This is the first step in
scheduling. The Office requested
that departments limit the number of
courses ottered in the most popular
periods, those which meet in the
late morning and alternocn on Mon-
day, Wednesday and Friday, to give
students greater choice. 56% of the
courses this semester are given in
the live most popular groups, making
it almost impossible for astudentto
register in allthe courses he wishes.
New guidelines should reduce this
figure to 47%.

Mr. Seller is convinced that the
lapses that, “those with pointed
ears,” noticed in his ottice are
quite temporary. and that, given the
various problems the office has to
lace, it does a pretty good 30
