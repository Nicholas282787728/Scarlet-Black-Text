Bakery Provides 2 a.m. Study Break

by Lynne Ogawa

it all started three years ago. A
bunch of students were out all night
and happened to drop in atthe Danish
Maid Bakery. They left with fresh,
warm doughnuts.

Now, the early morning trek is an
established tradition, bringing a
daily total oi 15»le students to the
bakery. The trip begins as early as
2:00 am,

According to
owner, the number increases around
exam time.

Mr. Hansen says he and his son,
Bill, enjoy theearly risers. Thestue
dents do not interlere with their work
at all. “We work around 'em," he
said,

The Hansens start at 1:00 a,m.and

George Hansen, '

work till about 11:30. The making of
bread and doughnuts occupythe very
early hours.

When students arrive, they are
likely to see the endoithedoughhut-
making process, the dipping of the
doughnut into the varioustoppings——
chocolate, vanilla, nuts, coconut,
etc.

Before, the dough was mixed,
raised, rolled, cut and raised again
in a warming box lit byalittle steam
burner. Then the doughnuts are
tried

Some are frozen to be warmed
later. The process is repeated again
at 7:00 am. '

Doughnuts are [he best»sellers.
“Over 50% oi our business is dough—
nuts,” said Mr. Hansen--“all types

(This is the tirst at a series of
articles in the son on teaching
methods at Grin-tell. in this article,
junior philosophy major Moioe West
compares the approaches and lech—
iiiqiies that Mr. Worley, Mr. Nasser,
and Mr. Klausner use in the Intro-
duction to philosophy course.)

As the present philosophy Depart-
ment Chairman, Mr. Worley says
that there are, by “departmental
agreement," two general objectives
for the introductory course. First,
the course should be such that, after
he has completed it, a student could
look at the other course offerings
(Ethics, Aesthetics, etc.) in the de»
partment and understand at least
what particular areas these courses
will cover. Secondly, the course
should be such that it introduces the
student to general philosophic prob»
lems (epistemology, metaphysics,
religion, etc.) and some or the “big
names” (Plato, Aristotle, Kant, etc.)
in the history of philosophy.

As regards his own introductory
class, worley says first, “lhatethe
title. It should be ‘Introduction to
Philosophizing.’ ” He makes the
distinction between the doing ofphi»
loscphy and the subject matter which
such action produces, and he points
out that it is the first, philosophiz»
ing, which he hopes to relate to stu»
dents.

Worley says he assumed that most
students already have some kind of
personal philosophy when they walk
into his intro. class. They have al—
ready been inﬂuenced by and ac—
cepted many ideas encountered in
sunday school, science, psychology,
etc.

However, since many of these phi»
losophical ideas were acquired in-
directly, the individual student ac-
cepts them in a generally uncritical
fashion. And Mr. Worley hopesthat,
by presenting important philosophi»
cal ideas directly, he may enable
students to be more criticaiofthem.

This is, of course, where the doing
at philosophy, philosophizing, comes
in. By showing the student exactly
what it is that he has accepted, Wdr~
ley hopes that the student will then go
on to re»evaluate and rearrange
some of his own ideas, to philoso»
phize about them.

Worley’s readings begin with prob»
lems of logic, and then include the
writings of several major philosoph-
ers (Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant,
Descartes, Sartre) he uses onlythe
original sources in covering these
philosophers, and he justilies this
choice by saying that “a student has

the right to meet at least one tirst»
class min ”during the course,Wor»
ley doesn’t assume that this mind
will necessarily be his or that ola
commentator on the philosophers
which his course includes,

As regards his testing procedures,
Mr. Worley says that for the last two
semesters he has not askedaspeci»
tic question on his exams. Ratherhe
has left it up to the student to decide
what part of the material he wishes
to discuss, and how he wishes to dISr
cuss it. Worley says that he does not
necessarily know “what is going to
turn the student on,” and thatsimple
regurgitation of material is not de-
sirable, since "by deﬁnition a me»
chanical answer is not philoso—
phizing.” “Fur better or worse,”
he says, a test “is a learning pro»
cess."

Another interesting aspect of Wor—
ley’s method is that he asks his stu-
dents to resubmit all work which is
below a c level. He believesthat this
helps in two ways. First, since many
students, particularly freshmen, are
somewhat trightened by the be»
ginning logic section, it gives them
more coniidence that they won’t get
hurt by it. Secondly, this practice
gives the students a notion that the
course is not simply a battle be-
tween the teacher andthestudents.
"I don’t want D‘s or F’s,” Worley
says. or, as one student put it, “It’s
harder to ﬂunk than to get an A."
Mr. Klausner’s major objectives
in his introductory classes are to
introduce the student to the diseip»
line. of philosophy, its problems, his
her disciplines and subject matter,
as well as to acquaint him with phi-
losophizing itseli.

Klausner says that hetries to com»

blue the problematic and historical
approaches. He also hopes toget the
students to do some personal phi»
losophizing by introducing them to
new ways of thinking, Strengthening
their critical powers, and enabling
them to analyze the reasons fortheir
own beliefs. He also hopes that stu»
dents will find some “intellectual
kinship" with a particular phi-
losopher or philosophic problem.

Klausner says that he would liketo
have smaller introductory classes,
since with large classes heis unable
to use his tavorite method of teaching
--the ”Socratic method." instead,
he is now forced to use a lecture
style interspersed with discussion
He feels that this method is some»
times inadequate, andthatsomestu»
dents are not stimulated into phi»
losophic renection.

Klausner hopes to reach the indi-
vidual student by changing a “vague
perplexity” ol belief into a more
critical attitude. He feels that he
must approach the personal inter—
ests and problems of students in—
directly, however, since “philo»
sophy is not high-classycounseling."

Some students have interpreted
Klausner’s objectives in this regard
as simple “regurgitation” ofmaterv
iaI learned either in reading or
class. They do not believe that
Klausner’s method in testing or
evaluation encourages “creative"
thinking or interpretations of phil»
osophic material.

The reading for Klausner’s intro—
ductory course is takehmainly from
a text entitled “Philosophy: The
Study of Alternative Beliefs”, which
he (and an ex»crinnell prolessor)
wrote. He says that using such a
text is partly a way of saving some
time. He recognizes that this is not
the only way to provide philosophic
material, but it is tlleonewith which
he “feels most comfortable.”

However, in order to give students
contact with original philosophic
writing, Klausner assignsa critical
book review on a book of their own
choice.

Mr. Nasser believes that current

philosophical study has become
overly concerned with so»called
“first philosophy," with problems of
metaphysics, epistemology, etc.
students get the impression (a wrong
one, he leels) thatphilosophy gener»
ally deals with abstract metaphysi»
cal problems which have no bearing
on the lives we lead.

Mr. Nasser hopes to impress stu—
dents with the fact thatphilosophy is
as much an “historical product” as
other writing, thatphilosophers have
always been inlluenced by, and have
in fact been trying to influence,
their social environment.

Mr, Nasser's introductory read-
ings reflect his attitudes and aims.
While he does cover such problems
as logic, metaphysics, and ethics,
he also assigns books such as “Dis~
obedience and Democracy,” “Cone
cerning Dissent and Civil Disobedis
ease," "The Underachieving
School," and “Teaching as a Sub-
versive Activity,"

These latter books reveal Nasser’s
belief that the philosophy of educa»
.tion is a very legitimatediscipline.
He hopes that his students can read
books in this area and evaluate the
authors’ philosophies by reference
to their own personal experience in
the educational process. He hopes
that philosophy can be related in
this way to the actual lives of its
students.

oi doughnuts."

Statistics Confirm his Statement,
From a basic doughnut dough, the
bakery produces 30 dozen glazed
doughnuts, 40 dozen cake dough»
nuts, 16 dozen longjuhns, 16 dozen
ccneys, 14 dozen bismarcks and two
dozen twists daily.

When asked if he had a secret
which accounted for the doughnuts’
success, he said he uses“aricher
dough of my own.”

In addition to the daily doughnut and
bread making, the Hansens bake
cakes, cookies, pies and danish
pastry.

Monday is cooky day, 250 dozen
cookies to be exact. Tuesday is
allotted to cakes, Wednesday to pies
and Thursdays to danish dough.
The bakery contains six freezer
shelves, 4 retarder shelves (cold
but not that cold) and a warmer to
keep the goods fresh until sale.
Mr. Hansen originally started as
an accountant. But in 1936, he he-
came like his father, a baker. In
the family tradition, Mr, Hansen's
son will eventually take oveg the
Danish Maid Bakery.

Thus students can rest assured
that this Grinnell experience will
endure {or at least another genera-
tion.
