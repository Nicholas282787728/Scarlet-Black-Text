It’s like the South Chicago Y, only
smaller and a hit shabhier. There’s
lots ot noise, a little organization,
and a lot ot full This then, is the
us, or Uncle Sam's Club. It’s ti-
uancially backed by the United Fund
with some aid lromthetown ofGrin-
hell and its purpose is to provide a
place to get together tor everyone
irom prerschoolers through high-
schoolers, altiiough the club is pri-
marily tor yoniiger children.

Located on pearl street on the
south side oi town, it is situated
in the pooier section ol Grinncll
The residents are trom the lower
income bracket and their children
make up the large inaiority ol those
attending the club.

The Unele Sam’s Club building is

large and brown on the outside and
wouldn't be very eheerlul on the in-
side were it not tor tlienoiseand the
contusion oi titteen kids engaged in
everything trout coloring to sllmsllr
ing against walls in toy cars, Ttiere
are some old wooden tables and
chairs, a terribly ollrkey piano, a
miniature high Jump. and a variety
oi games, hooks, and other equips
ineiit. Downstairs there is a pool
table

The place comes to life about 3 00
pin wtien preschoolers arrive from
home and grammar school students
(up to about nine years oltl) arrive
from school There are also A few
jtllllorrhlgh school students. Mrs.
Thompson, the middle-aged woman
who is in charge or the club, ex-
plnlned that, though these oldel'stu-
dents didn't really belong there, she
lel them stay since “it was better
than them hanging around the pool
rooms in lawn." (Shades ot River
City, lowa).

Ml's TllOlIlpsuIl also stated that
college stutlcnls are desperately
needed to work (it the club. ”Th0

club is actually supposed to be a
college proiect,” she said, "the
college students are welcome to
come in at any time.” Shecontinued
that there are any number otpro-
jects that can he done and it any
funds are needed they can be obtained
through her. “Working at the club
is a great way to get to meet the
kids ot the community,” she con-
eluded.

The program (or younger children
runs Monday through Thursday from
3:00 to 5:30 and Saturday afternoons
from 2:00 to 5:00. On Wednesday
nights, there are programs for
fourth and fifth graders and on Mon-
day and Thursday evenings, pro-
grams ror junior-high and high
school students. “But the real help
is needed with the young children,”
Mrs Thompson stressed. Cuuking
and sewing classes CDllld be Started
tor the girls she said, and organized
sports were needed (orallthe Child-
ren. “This can only he done with
help irom the college. We've had
students working here since the club
opened Iouryears ago and it’salways
worked out very well.”

This year, the Grinnell College
rolk Dancers have been going over
to the club on a quasi»weekly basisi
Complex dances were pertormed and
easier dances were taughtThepro-
gram has been a successful one,
according to those who have partir
cipated in it.

There are also a number of stu»
dents working at the club now on an
irregular basis. According to one of
these volunteers, the club is a good
one but could be improved with a
more structured program

This is what Mrs. Thompson is
working on now. Sltehas thebuilding,
the funds, and the kids-mow all she
needs is some workers. So--please,
remember Uncle Sam’s wantsyou!
