Are We Overworked?

All signs indicate that students, whatever the reason, are working harder
this year than they did last year. Library circulation is up, and rumor has
it that better quality work is being done this year.

in themselves, these things are not at all alarming, and they may reflect
a law rather obvious iacts about the present. Competition ior good jobs,
fellowships, and places in graduate and professionalschools is more intense
now than it has been in recent years; even if students do not feel constrained
to compete intensely with other Grinnell students, they need to remember
that they are competing with students at other schools.

President Leggelt closed the first faculty meeting of the year with the
inierence that a good teacher “pushes our students so clearly and excitingly
that they are happy to work beyond their immediate capacities." in some
courses this hint may have been taken very seriously, as many students
think. Clearly, students are pushing themselves harder academically now
than in any year since we have been here.

what worries people about all this is that some students are driving theme
selves too hard, to the point where they may break down before finals are
over. There are reliable reports that many lreshmcn, especially, are not
getting enough exercise, sleep, and relaxation; and that a large amount oi
speed is being consumed, as a stimulant to keep people going at the books,

We do not think that the increased interest in schoolwork is in itself at
all alarming. Nor is the fact that some professors are working students
harder than they did last year, This may reflect a rededication to the one
interest we are all supposed to have in common, the pursuit of knowledge
In addition to the tighter situation with jobs and graduate school admissions,
and enthusiasm of many students for the new Curriculum, there have simply
been fewer diversions this year than in the recent past, when more students
and professors were involved more often with the anti~war movement or with
other forms of social protest and political action. This has left more time
ior study and for class preparation.

There are students who cannot handle what seems to be much greater
pressure without overworkingthemselves, this group wlll exist however great
or small the workload may be, but when there is more work there are more
such students.

But the problems each of these students face are individual ones. Each
student must set a realistic goal for him or herself, and he or she must
learn to work efficiently Within individual limitations. There may be those
among us who can study twentyethree hours a day for a month at a time
without collapsing, but the rest of us should plan into our Schedules the
sleep we need, whether it be six, eight, or ten hours each day. It would
do no harm if we all tried to get some exercise now and then. Planning
these things takes a kind of selfrdisoipline which is not emphasized at
a college like Grinnell, but it is important. It would do one little good to
graduate from Grinnell with an honors degree and be unable to walk across

. the platform to receive the diploma.

This kind of discipline requires that one begin papers earlier than the night
belore they are due, and it requires thatprolessors give a reasonable amount
oi notice when they assign a paper or test. The Grinnell rule requires a
weeks notice, and we hope all proiessors are giving at least this much warns
ing. And professors ought to do their best to spread the work through the
semester. The kinds of situations in which students have five to ten large
papers due within one or two weeks atthe end oi the semester usually result
from very poor Scheduling on the part of professors. The increased use of
take-home exams and almost “openended” paper assignments has aggra-
vated this problem, and it is one clear Case where professors could help by
a greater variety of work, especially at iinals.

Mostly, however, personal academic problems need to be faced by the
individual student, and student advisors and counsellors are more than
willing to help any student solve the problem which academic pressure
creates for him. It seems to us that the responsibility of student advisors
and hail officers is to try to encourage students who may be overdoing it to
relax and to help them deal with the specific situations they face; and the
responsibility oi prolessors is to keep in mind the possible overall eiiect
of their personal enthusiasm for specific subjects or specific methods of
of teaching or evaluation.

The Doppelt Effect
'- Pressure Groups

enough time ior one's eyes to adjust
much less to relieve any academic
pressure. That was last Thursday
night.

But academic pressure remains
and has reached epidemic propor—
tions, l have witnessed a lot more
physical illnesses, temporary mell~
tal breakdowns, and proiessors
backlashing at accusations ofslaver

ty and administration has mainly
been restricted to Controlling the

underlying causes,

Too many discusslons have harped
on the conflict over whetherthere is
more academic pressure this year
than in previous years,

"I have three more papers this
year than last "

“My tutorial is really interesting
and is taking an enormousamountof
my time ” (ImplicationnHumanr
ties was as stimulating as a pair of

Humanities, Overall

“Last year 1 only used sixpencils,
and I’ve already used nine so far
this year That’s not counting the
one I gnawed out oi frustration.”

Do we have a barometer to measure
the pressure? All the reasons, no
matter how valid, and all the coun—
ter-denials are mainly statistical
trivialities. What matters is that
many students are becoming neu~
rotics and dropping out. So what it

Nose Grows

There is no question that we have
an extensive work load, out lhave
never incurred such a rash ofhypOr
chondria. We've discovered the ulr
timate, allrencompassing excuse.

“Oh, I had planned to write Mom,
but there’s so much academic pres
sure ”

“I would use the phys. ed. complex,
but my study breaks only include a
cup or Coffee ‘atthe forum anda max.
imum oi two trips tothebathroom.”

“I wouldn’t know anything about
hall impersonality I’m always at the
library "

People have censured meior having
a, big nose. I blamed it on academic
pressure. lt grew another inch.

The problem with this snowballing
eiiect is the possibility oi an ava»
lanche. Legitimate grievances stand

a chance, but impetuous complaints
emit an aura oi seeking “the easy
way out,” With a paper to do, it’s
astounding how easy it is to plead
academic pressure.

everthrow the System

The argument that academic pres
sure is a malady ol our present
system and only inhibits learning
must be approached from a more
radical angle than diminishing the
work load or adding a holiday or
emphasizing the Revolving Door.
To rid academic pressure, you must
overthrow the system which pro
vokes it; and the possible reperCuSr
sum or that are still being dis
cussed.

The resounding complaints con-
cerning academic pressure have
dwelt on burdensome workloads and
demanding proiessors. But many
students succumb to academicpres»
sure because of their outlooks,
moods, worries, etc., no matterhow
high their actual work load registers
on the barometer. One paper can do
it.

Harmless, Hysteria

l like to believe that each oi us has
interests that can serve to relieve
academic pressure, But my beliels
were almost shattered as a result or
the blackout last Thursday. Theinie
tial reaction to the blackout was
“now how can I iinish my paper?”
But that soon changedtothe glorious
realization that we'd been provided
with an excuse to relax. Laughter,
calm contemplation, and harmless
hysteria lollowed.

Then, Thomas Edison camebackto
haunt us, Well, that was it.The study
break was over and all the pressur»
ized students returned to the books.

The Heroes Relax

Except a few. Those are the herds
of this parable. Those are the ones
who stretched their study break
without the use ouuicy Fruit, Those
are the ones who decided that the
heating plant wouldn’t regulate when
they would relax, Thosearetheones
who didn't complain that they had to
get back to the old grind. Those are
the ones who sulier from academic
pressure, but can combat it and not
let it get them down. Those are the
ones who comiortahly satthere mak
ing iun oi the peoplewho perpetually
sit at their carrels and now, in need
oi a candle, couldn’t remember
where their rooms were.

And those are the ones who had no
complaints because instead oi being
in an electricityrless room, they
were now relaxing in a room
equipped with a iunctioning stereo,
popcorn popper, coffee pot, and
strategically placed candles.

Freaks Party, War Per'sisls

by Terry wall

In a recent taped interview for the
Washington post; Senator Thom»
as r. Eagleton (D. Mo.)lamented the
iact that, in trying to gain support ior
a particular issue in the Senate, he
was inhibited by the brief“attention
span of his colleagues". ll, aiter
having made Senators conscious or
a problem, action was not taken on
the problem shortly thereafter, the
chances oimaintaining awareness on
that issue, Senator Eagleton noted,
were virtually nil, This phenomenon
has by no means been restricted to
the Senate. .

In April or this year, over 250,000
demonstrated in the capital, virtu~
ally filling all space between the
Capitol and the Washington Monur
ment. Last Saturday, November 6,
a slim 2500 marched down Penn-
sylvania Avenue irom the Capitol
to the Ellipse. What happened?
Even the fact that Saturday’s
marches were to he of a regional
nature cannot tully explain that lact
that, in Washington, a city oi five
major universities, only 2500
showed up. Can it be that the attene
tion span of those who marched this
spring is no longer than seven
months, or do they believe, with
some yustiiiable cynicism, that

peace marchers are now simply
beating a dead horse?

I suppose I came to this march not
knowing exactly what to expect
Friends had told me of the exhilir
rating ieeiings oi solidarity, power,
and hope that had characterized the
march in Washington last spring
With this glowing image in the back
oi my mind, and having heard the
optimistic predictions of a turnout
of 25,000, I Could not help but feel
dismayed by the size and the nature
of the crowd that had gathered at
the Capitol. There was anything but
the sense oi urgency that the slogan
for the march -- "Out Now'” --
seemed to imply. Nor was thereany
great sense oi solidarity, tor, to me,
solidarity implies a joining oihands
of people from all walks of life, In-
stead, there was only similarity,
uniformity.

when we started out, we were urged
to walk four abreast that the rear
might not he so close to iront. As we
walked up Pennsylvania Avenue an
occasional chant of peace now rose
up but quickly trailed off. The

Washington Post described
Saturday's march as “hauntingly
tranquil".

When we arrived at the Ellipse, a
small crowd had already assembled.
A rock band was playing and kids

everywhere were drinking beer and
smoking dope. I couldn’t help won-
dering ii this was a peace demon-
stration or Just a party ior freaks.

There was the usual iare ofspeakr

things to say about the president, l
thought, when thereare so many real
things he can be criticized ior7

Amid the torrent oi cliches, only
I. r, Stone, socialist writer, really
attracted my attention, Expressing
some oi my own leelings, Mr Stone
said: “The time oi demonstrations
oi this type is really over. Thesitur
ation is much morecomplicated than
we can lace with simple minded slur
gans...We’ve got to stop just tnlklng

could be "no Dunkirk in Vietnam.”
Early in the Nixon Administration
this seemingly plausible explanation
satistied me. Three years later, i
can no longer be satisiied by that
explanation. As Herhlock- noted in a
recent editorial cartoon, during the
three years oi Nixon’s withdrawal
program, 18,786 Americans have
died in lndochina,

Huxlable Notes
Isolationism

To the Editors:

Many people have been concerned
over the increase inacademicpres»
sures at Grinnell. Those people who
have not been secluded in their
rooms all last week now that many
discussions have taken place on this
topic. Admittedly, more students are
studying harder at Cirinnell this
year. In addition, though, many
courses here have increased their
work loads. This situation has had
some bad consequences.

Many ireshmen, as well as upper
class students, are spending all of
their time here cloistered in their
rooms. Social interaction has thus
been drastically reduced. Granted,
a college education must involve
some studying but there is more to
education. Students must also learn
how to live with other students, I
see a definite lack of this type of
education at Grinnell this year.
Besides this general isolationism,
there have been a number ofserious
emotional traumas over academics.
During a freshman yearthat is trau-
matic anyhow, the increasedpres-
sure makes it even more so. lnever
worked as hard during freshman
year as most seem to be working
now. One further indication of the
magnitude ol the problem is the
quantity or amphetamines being
used lor the purpose at studying. l
believe we are last approaching an
intolerable situation at Grinnell,

To remedy this, Ibelieve every
proiessor should consider the
course work for his Classes, and
whether it would be possible to
lighten the load. Particular com—
plaints have been heard from many
students concerning courses in Biol,
ogy, Chemistry, Am. Civ., lntro
Psych, Anthro, some history
courses, and some of the upper—
level language courses. hlso, lurge
the faculty de declare the Friday
and Saturday aiter Thanksgiving as
buffer days without classes. These
actions will help reduce the pres—
sure.

Finally, any students whoareupset
about work loads should talk to their
proiessors, and to Dean Wall, or
Dean Walker. Tell them your con-
cerns. Through theseactionswewill
be able to achieve a better allraround
living situation at Grinnell.

p.s. As a letter to the editor irom
me would be repetitious, I share
Bob's concern over this issue. Let’s
