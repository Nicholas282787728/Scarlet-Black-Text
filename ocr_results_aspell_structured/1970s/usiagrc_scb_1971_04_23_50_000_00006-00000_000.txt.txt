THE SCARLET AND BLACK

Reorganization Debate Continues

Philip Kintner, professor of
history, was elected chairman
of the Faculty Organization
Committee at Monday's fac-
ulty meeting.

Also named to the committee
were L. H. Durkee, professor
of biology; David Jordan, as
sistant professor of history;
John Morris, newly promOted
associate professor of psy‘
chology; and Gene Wubbels,
assistant professor of Chemo
istry.

Debate on the Executive Cou-
ncil's reorganization proposal
continued. Chairman of the
Faculty Beryl Clotfelter told
the faculty that the two basic
purposes of the EC plan were
to free the EC of some of its
duties so that it could engage
in more long-range planning,
and to involve department ch-
airmen more in the college
operation. '

He suggested several modi-
fications of the EC plan, fol-
lowing several ideas that had
been expressed to him.

They included deletinga secs
tion of the EC duties that
appeared to overlap with the
duties of the Committee on
Educational Policy (EPC),
providing for the election of

an independent chairman of
the Faculty Organization Co-
mmittee (instead of the chair-
man of the faculty), and de-
leting thc profision that the
divisional executive commit
tcc approve all course chan-
ges and changes in major pro"
grams and replacing it with a
section that calls for the com-
mittee to review the previous
year and to make projections
for future years.

Clotfelter’s presentation was
followed by general discus-

sion.

The only substance to come
out of the debate was an am'
end by Greg Guroff, assistant
provessor of history, thatwas
passed by the ﬁculty prohibr
iting any faculty member from
serving on the EC for more
than two out of every four
years.

Al Jones, professor of his-
tory, proposed and then WIIh’
drew a motion exempting the
office of the chairman of the
faculty from the restriction.

parts, speaks with Grinnell faculty members Al Jones
and James Magge. Garrett advocated an NLF victory

Jones asked the question "Is
this to maintain 'The Em~

not forget that the initial d5,

perhaps to try to eliminate
what it originally perceived
to be evidences ofa monolithic

gee interjected the hope that
Garrett was not asking all
social scientists to stop work-
ing simply because bad men
in the Government might get
hold of their results. Garrett
said that, indeed, he did not
hope that this would be the
case, but that they would do a
little looking before they leap-
ed into government-funded
Asian research projects.
Garrett's last session was
an informal one on the future
of "The Movement,” in which
he outlined some of his ideas
on effecting a cultural revol-
ution in America. These in-
cluded "studying the Pig"
(those political and intellec»
tual leaders of the current
culture), "defend(ing) our
culture," and making use of
modern technology, media,
and art forms to bring home
the message of peaceful cul-
tural revolution to the People.
