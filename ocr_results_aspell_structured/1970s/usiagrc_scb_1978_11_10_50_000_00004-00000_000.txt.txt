Save Mears!

The trustees have decided to tear down Mears and add an
extra floor onto Norris. Hard to believe. isn’t it? In fact,
most people’s first reaction to this statement is, “you’ve
got to be ioking . . .”

Unfortunately, this is no joke. The decision was made
with very little publicity or consultation of the campus
community. The trustees did not exactly keep the matter a
secret, but neither were they particularly forthcoming. In
fact, when one 5&3 reporter asked a trustee it the Board
anticipated any maior changes in the physical plant' In the
next few years, the trustee answered simply, “No. " Un-
doubtedly the Board knew that its decision would be un-
popular and controversial.

MOST PEOPLE WOULD agree that Norris is the least
desirable dorm on campus. Very few seniors and iuniors
choose to live there; most of the residents are freshmen
and sophomores who had little or no choice. It has
problems with noise, insulation, healing and cooling.

These problems are certainly correctable, but an even
more important factor aggravates the situation. The
building itself. because of its sterile, uniform style and
motel-like ambiance, is just not a very attractive place to
live. The outside of the building is ugly and the inside also
leaves much to be desired. These problems cannot be
rectified, but surely we should not compound them by
adding on to the building, making it even more conspicuous
and forcing even more students to live there.

THE OTHER HALF OF THE issue involves Mears, the
second oldest building on campus and certainly one of the
most unique and pleasing aesthetically. Mears has many
faults that deserve attention. To fix it up would prove
costly. However, the costs of rehabilitating Mears must be
weighed against the benefits: not only does Mears offer an
attractive place to live, it also graces the appearance of the
college and provides a concrete reminder of the college’s
rich past.

The administration seems to'be busily trying to wipe out
any and all physical reminders of the college's past (see
open space, p. 6). This is a crime. A liberal arts institution
thrives on the interaction between ideas of the past and the
present. its physical surroundings should reflect this in
teraction as well as the college’s growth. Since Mears and
Goodnow are the only remaining symbols of the college’s
beginnings, their preservation takes on special im-
portance.

THE W77 DOBER REPORT, the housing study upon
which Grinnell is basing its current renovations, recomr
mehds the resin tion or rehabilitation of Mears. ”We do
not favor demolition,” the report states. it adds that the
costs of fixing up Mears might be alleviated if Mears
“becomes recognized as an historic landmark and qualifies
for matching Federal funds.” This event appears likely, as
Mears is expected to be named to the National Register of
Historic Places this January.

We ask the trustees to reconsider their decision about the
fates of Mears and Norris. We also strongly urge the rest of
the campus community to express their opinions to the
administration and trustees. Dates for the enaction at these
plans have not been finalized. This is one case in which an
expression of community opinion may go a long way
toward avoiding a terrible mistake.
