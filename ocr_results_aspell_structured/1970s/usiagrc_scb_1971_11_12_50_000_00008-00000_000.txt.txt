Booters lose

In their eighth game of the season
the Grinnell soccer team Suffered
their fourth defeat. This unforlunate
event was precipitated by a strong
Carleton offense which scored three
goals while their defensive unit shut
out the Pioneer offense.

Although they allowed three goals,
the Pioneers did not play a bad
game. Goalie Lee Edmonds led the
unit by making many diiticult stops.
By far the most exciting of these
was his repeat of last week’s save
on a penalty shot. Other outstand-
ing performances were turned in
by iulibacks John VidetichandRoger

Hockey Contest
Held At Ames

In a series of three close games,
the Grinnell women's field hockey
team emerged semi-victorious last
Saturday with one win and two losses
after a long and tiring day on the
field of play.

The three games were played
against the University of Northern
Iowa, in which the Grinnell team was
defeated 170; Iowa State, in whichthe
home team won with a ﬁnal score of
1-0; and Iowa Wesleyan, which wasa
3-2 loss. A total of six teamspartir
Cipated in this tournament, held at
Antes, which heralded the end ofthe
field hockey season.

The teams were paired off by a
random match system, in which the
captains of the squads picked numr
hers and the squads matched ac-
cordingly.

Poor playing conditions and a
strong wind were cited as factors
which affected the overall perforv
mance of the Grinnell team. Hows
ever, team captain Laura David
feels (as do the sports editors ofthe
5&5) that the team truly deserves
recognition for its efforts in this
past hockey season.
