'uiid, while his new proposals are
ending In SGA Athletic Director

ohn Piitsch feels that Frankle is very
glcal with his proposals, Piitsch has
elicd on Frankie as an adviser to the
dministration in this regard.

Three years ago, when Frankle

ame to Grinnell as a freshman, all
lat was available to him in the area
l'fi‘eerweights was a set of

omemade barbellsi‘strange concoc-
ons of steel pipe and cementrfilled
ans." As a dedicated weightlifter,
rankle then brought his own set from
ome. He set himself up in one of the
'am locker rooms but because of the
otential danger to other students. he

llowers worked out amidst the noise,

wimining Coach Ray Obermiller con-
idcred the situation a health hazard
nd oiiered Frankie a section or the

‘rankle, “the room was piled high

ith wall~to wallrjunk.”

Frankie admits that his enthusiasm
or weights is perhaps unrealistic
>ompared to other athletes who want
o develop for whatever particular 30
ivity in which they are involved.

evertheless, Frankle insists that his
leas for improved training laeilities

'eels strongly that weight training is a
~ommon denominator ior all athletics.

parts which prevails at Grinnellxﬁ
While Frankie fantasizes Of a train»

arpetlng, air conditioning, etc., he
now: that lils dream is an im-
.ossibility al Grinnell. Nevertheless,

Frankle and some of the other
members of the weightlifters club
have gone out and sought signatures
for a petition which attests to the need
for improved weight iacilities Over
200 signatures were gathered in a
short period or time. Presently, many
of the coache e also petitioning for
improved fac es. Coach Ed Dom»
broski has expessed a willingness to
teach a course inrweight training to
the college community.

As a result oi Frankle's pressure
and the interest expressed by several
coaches, Pfitsch has discussed with
his colleagues a variety of ossible 0pc
tlons for an improved weig t room.
”No deciswns have yet been made,"
said Pfitsch. Meanwhile, Frankle has
taken his proposal to SGA, where it
was denuded that the weightlifter:
should approach the trustees directly.
As such, Briles and Tom Helpenstell
are writing a letter expressing their
concern. The letter will point out how
weightlifting helped each ot these two
athletes to achieve all—American
status.

While Pfitsch is in favor of an im-
proved facility, he cites two major
problems: one, he says, is finding the
money, the other is vandalism.
Piitsch's previous experience with
loose weights is that they get stolen,
He anticipates the added expense of
student labor fees in order to monitor
an open weight room. Pfitsch does not
necessarily blame students for past
vandalism, but he does suspect outside
people who “visit” the campus

While the issue of weight training
tacilities is perhaps making waves
among students, athletes, and
coaches, at the higher levels of ad
ministration the issue is unknown.
Waldo Walker, dean oi the college,
had never been informed of a specific
request for weight training lacility
iunds However, when he was told
about the SGA stipulation that

Pulleys play on important part in pumr
ping iron
weightlifters appeal directly to
trustees, he said, “I do not approve or
it ”

Walker explained that the trustees
do not appreciate being approached by
individual interest groups, The '
trustees donate money to a general
fund from which the college ads
ministrators decide the appropriate
allocations. The system is one in ,
which the president represents an of— .
ficer of the college as a liaison bee .
tween the interests of the college and 1
the trustees. it interest groups go
directly to the trustees without the
president‘s knowledge, the system
eventually breaks down. .

Walker added, however, that if the :
school administrators refuse to fund a :
special interest group and the din on '
campus becomes great enough, the- .
trustees should perhaps know about
