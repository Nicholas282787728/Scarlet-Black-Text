Grinnell College’s second semese
ter academic calendar has been
altered in response to the Contin-
uing fuel crisis.

Under a plan implemented Monday
by President Glenn Leggett iollowe
ing unanimous endorsement at aspr
ecial taculty meeting, Christmas var
cation will be extended two weeks,

0 until February 4, with the lost days
to be made up by shortening mid»
semester break and slightly leng-
thening the academic year.

Second semester registration win
be held Sunday, February 4, with
classes beginning at 8 am. the
following day. Spring recess, ori-
ginally scheduled to begin March

plan, but will end April 1 as ori-
ginally scheduled.

. Second semester will end May
25, with Commencement May 27
and Alumni weekend Friday June
7 and Saturday June 8.

other Measures

Other energy conservation mea-
sures already in effect or being
implemented include maintainingall
building temperatures at between 56
and 68 degrees and closing all re-
sidence halls and academic build»
ings (except Burling Library and
those administrative buildings wh»
ich normally open) during Christe
mas and Spring breaks, with tempr
eratures in these buildings cut to
between 50 and 55 degrees.

Arrangements are also being made
to have housekeeping work perfor»
med during daylight nd early even-
ing hours in adm istrative and
academic buildings.

Associate Dean of the College Ja—
mes Hamilton has been named as
energy conservation coordinator,

_i~le reports receiving a iew com-
plaints plus several suggestions for
conservation since Monday’s deci-
sion was announced.

Student Reaction

Student leaders were informed Nev
vember B that sudden developments
in the energy shortage would prob-
ably necessitate a change in the ac-
ademlc calendar.

House presidents met with their
constituents Sunday, thenassembled
at a special meeting of the Joint

Boards to make a recommendation.
Students appeared to be almostunv

animous in their feeling that almost

Cut lhe lights

At least two‘ major lighting dis-
plays and a traditional 24 hours
a day Grinnell gathering place have
been eliminated by the energy cri—
sis.

Feter Parish, President of the
Grinnell Junior Chamber of Com-
merce, announced Wednesday that
the Jaycees have cancelled the an»
nual Christmas home lighting con.
test,

Parish said that, although formal
entries are not required for the
contest, he believes that about 100
homes were decorated for it last
year.

Dave Barns, Chief of the Grinnell
Volunteer Fire Department, has an.
nounced that the large radio tower
near the Police and Fire station
at Fourth and Spring will not he
lighted up for Christmas this year.
The darkened tower will represent
a break in a tradition started in
1963, four years after the building
was constructed.

Steven Ward, manager of theGrin-
nell Chamber of Commerce says
decorative lights in the downtown
business district will be turned oft
at the end of the business day as

an energy saving measure.
ward also said that stores re

maining open late for the Christ
mas season will close at B p.m.,
one hour earlier than in past years.
However, these stores will observe
the traditional 9 pm. closing hour
during the last week before Christ»
mas Day,

Finally, a three year old Grinnell
tradition will end tomorrow, when
McNally’s Super»Valu store will
end its 24 hour-per-day operations.

Virgil oroth, co-owner ofthe store,
said Wednesday that by operating
the grocery from ’7 a.m. until ll
p.m., the convenience or customers
would still be served while enough
energy would be saved each week
to heat several school classrooms.

any alteration in the College‘s pre
sent structure would be preferable
to extending the academic calendar
beyond the end or May.

After some discussion of the eff—
ects of various proposals on stu—
dents, the House Presidents voted
in favor of a plan almost identical
to that approved the next day.

Major eﬂects of the calendar ch-
anges appear to center on the six
week period between semesters,
which has academic implications,
and the shortened Spring break,wh-
ich carries with it financial prob-
lems for some students.

Students and faculty have noted
that the longer Christmas vacation
could provide an opportunity ior
work on independent projects and
advance work on second semester
courses.

The Committee on Academic
Standing was askedduringMonday’s
faculty meeting to consider the aca-
demic implications oithe lengthened
vacation. One strong feeling expres—
sed at the meeting was that syllabi
and reading lists should be distri—
buted before vacation toaid students
in their advance work,

Concern has also been expressed
for those students who live long
distances from Grinnell. Dormitor~
ies will he closed during Springvar
cation, but some students said that
it would be financially impossible to
return home for a period of little
more than a week.

lems at the station.

Demands Extra
Classes End

Dean of the College Waldo Walker
has issued a statement to the fac-
ulty asking them to stop the prac-
tice of holding additional class meet—
ings.

Walker says that complaints he has
received have centered ontwopraCr
tices: scheduling extra meetings to
cover additional material, and giv»
ing examinations outside of sche-
duled class time.

in his statement, Walker notes,
"i hope that those who have made
such arrangements will decide on
their own initiative to refrain from
continuing this practice rather than
waiting for official action by the
appropriate agencies.”

Walker added that, if there is not
voluntary cooperation, necessary
action will be taken to insure that
extra class meetings do not con-
tinue.
