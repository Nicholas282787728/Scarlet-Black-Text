Plan Bike Workshop,Co-op

by Dee Dee Goldie

it all goes well, hike riders will
have a place to iix their hikes and
meet other riders this Spring. The
bicycle repair ice-operative, being
organized by Tom Vanderhyden and
Rail Acton, is to be located under
Mears Hall in the 01d Revolving
Door.

Tools, lubricants and solvents will
be available and Acton or Vander-
hyden will show riders how to re
pair their bikes. Bicycle tools are
very specialized and expensive, and
the average hike owner can rarely
afford to have enough to make ne—
Cessary repairs.

A facility like this would enable
a rider to fix his bike himself,
without having to go to a repair
shop. It would also be a place,
according to Acton and Vanderhyr
den, where riders could organize
group trips and races and sell us
ed equipment.

“Hopefully, it will he a place tor
people who like to ride to find other
people and ride with them” said

Acton. Acton is hoping that the‘

co-op could become an organizing
Spot for other Outdoor activities as
well. ,

Backpackers, campers, hikers and

Scarlet and Black mum hy noug Nnisty

omers could arrange activities the
rough the co»cp.“ I’d like to think
oi it as a hillboar Acton said,
“that could be used by everyone
with an interest in the outdoors.
“We estimate we'll need about$230
tor tools,” Vanderhyden Said. He
was guaranteed $100 irom the Inir
tiative Fund in December, and is
hoping to get $100 more from SGA,
He feels the nature or the printed
is one that SGA should be Willing
to fund. “This won’t be a transient
activity. I feel it will growintime.”
Vanderhyden is sure there is en
ough interest to sustain the co-op.
”I took a survey of interest in DeCs
ember and 1 got approximately 240
replies to it.” Acton added ”Look
at all the bikes in the loggia. There
are definitely a lot 0t bike riders
here.” i

“I didn't want to make it a coup,
but Initiative Fund Wantedsomesort
of protection for their investment.
They telt that it people paid a
membership tee at say, $1, they
would be less likely to Steal tools,”
said Vanderhyden. ‘

Acton, who owns his own bicycle
Shop in Michigan, is hoping that
eventually the co-op will be able
to purchase minor bikeparts whole

sale and sell them to Comp meme ‘
bers. This would help riders to
save money, as they could install
them themselves at‘the Corop.

“Rad and 1 have a vested self
interest in this. We both ride and
would like to ride with others. I’d
especially like to teach people to
take care of their bikes. There are
so many bikes in the loggia in var-
ious states of disrepair,” Vander-
hyden said.

Acton and vanderhyden estimate __
that the {10-01) will be open hy
Spring. “1 think it will open right
before break or shortly after,"

said Vanderhyden.

United Farm Workers (UFW) ices
burg lettuce rates as the only Saga
Food Service item that is on stand
mg order with suppliers, according
to Jerry Ramaker, FoodServiceDis
rector.

Due to student stipulations, Saga
has irequehtly had to send back she
iploads oi head lettuce atter diSA
covering it was not UFW, Ramaker
added that Grinnell is the only sch—
ool so particular about lettuce sou-
rces, and that suppliers whogeher—
ally order 100 Cases of lettuce at
once will not caterto Grlnnell, which
uses only 10 cases a week.

Suhstitute greens are purchasedhy
Saga when head lettuce is impossible
to Obtain. Ramaker noted that this
is trequently the case. Thus less»
favorite greens tend to be offered
exclusively.

Lettuce difficulties are not the
only problems Saga must solve.Ch-
eese has been another difficult item
to obtain. Remaker explained that
there was simply none to buy he-
tore Christmas and that the syn-

thetic cheese offered last week was
a case of “that or nothing."

The truckers’ strike has also p1-
ayed havoc with menu planning.
Ramaker stated that Saga does not
know irom one day to the next
what actually will be delivered, and
that the uncertain items range trom
meats to produce to canned goods.

Saga must also contend with inﬂar
tion and rising tood prices. Although
Saga signs yearly contracts at ne—
gotiated prices, suppliers may raise
the levels it they can show cause
tor the increase.

As an example, milk suppliershave ‘
raised their prices three times this
year. Farm prices have also Cau—
sed problems by rising 34% during
1973.

The tollowing list includes price
increases from December 1972 to
December 1973 Di Common items
which Saga purchases
