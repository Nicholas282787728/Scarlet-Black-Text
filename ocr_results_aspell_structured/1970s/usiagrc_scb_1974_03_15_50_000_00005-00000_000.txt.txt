Tunslall: Health Center Of lillle Use

To the Editor '

The article in last week's ShB
entitled "Doctors, Nurses Disv
cuss Health Center" presented
a remarkable phenomenon: the
nurses interviewed were clearly
in a position of answering their
own question even as they asked
it. The viciousvcircle nature of
the "discussion" seemed to the

blatant and obvious; but for those ,

who perhaps only skimmed the
article (as I did the first time),
here follows what appears to me
to be a self-evident paradox?

On one hand, the Health Center
nurses profess an utter mystifi-
mtion regarding thenegative Sti-
gma attached .to the H.C. Why is
our rapport with the students so
poor? they wonder. Why don't stur
dents come to us when they are
sick?

Ch the other hand, they make
very clear as both in the article
and whenactuallydispensing serr
vices ._ that there sre'definite
limitations on the services they
can offer. They Can't diagnose,
they can’t prescribe, they can't
run lab tests, they can't set
broken bones. The H.C. is staf-
fed by RNS; they all want us to
understand that after a point,
there is nothing hey can do but
refer students to doctors in town
for professional care.

These two attitudes manifested

Hansen: Vole Reiner

To the Editors:

I wish to thank everyone who
supported me in the election this
week. I would add something to
the effect that "I will do my best
to earn the confidence you have
placed in me," except that the
phrase sounds awfully trite.

It may seem strange that [am
once again appealing for your
votes so soon after the election
Nevertheless, that is what I prov
pose to do.

I met Pete Reiner just this
year, but his repunation had alr-
eady spread far and wide. (yes,
even as far as Norris I’hll) As
an SA, he has been known as a
warm, concerned, person with
a real flair for communication.
He has shown himself to be am-
azingly perceptive; able to meet
every siniation with decisive,yet
thoughtful.'action. He hasn’t had
much experience with SGA (an-
other point in his favor) but his
experience as an SA and on stu~
dent-faculty committees convin-
ces me that he is not likely to
be sucked in hyphoney sugar
coated arguments.

I need Pete Reiner in Student
government. He's a man of inde~
pendence, who will take a good
deal of the pressure off my job.
More importantly, you need Pe-
te Reiner in student government.
It is ofparticularimportance this
year to put the very best people
in ofﬁce. If the studentstaccom-
plieh nothing this year, I think
that even I would be inclined to
vote for DIgi-tek in next year's
Elections.

Sincerely,
John Hansen

To the Editors:

I wish to give a public expression
of thanks to Dean Bob Jacobs for
conceivuig and coordinatingthepro-
gressive dinners this past Saturs
day evening. My wife and I found
it to he a delightful experience,
an excellent way in which to meet
and ialk with fifteen different stu-
dents in an oil-campus seningJ
was pleased that some thirty or so
faculty, administrative, stall dining
rooms in homes were volunteered.
I am concerned thata significant
number of students wanting to share
in this dinner were notable to be-
to participate.

I hope this program will be cone
tinned. It’s a good one!

by the staff of the H.C. are abs
surdly incompatible. Nurses: be
it lclown that we DO undersnand
the very tangible limitations on
your services. That is, very
simply, why we don't come tothe
H.C. It is a waste of time. A
student with a cold does not
need an RN to tell her/him to
rest, drink ﬂuids and chew Vit-
amin C. If the student becomes
sick enough to need an antibio-
tic, s/he will need a doctor to
prescribe it, At what point did
the sick student need the "inter
mediate" care of the H.C.’I At
no point. The H.C. is in fact

rendering useless -- or at best
superﬂuous _, services. That,
Htc. Staff, is why studentsaren't
coming.

If I am mildly sick, I know how
to take care ofmyself. Mymother
taught me how. If I am verysick,
I will make a phone‘mll to a
doctor. and setup an appointment.
My mother taught me how to do
that too.

In short: Why go to McNally‘s
via rt. 8!), if you can get there
by going down 6th and turning
left on Main?

To the Editors:

The purpose of this letter is to

not be served unless I included
in this letter those persons who

most unenjoyable season.

First, I _want to thank the few
referees who volunteered their
services when I needed them:
Chip Hall, Dave Guittar, Ed Mc‘
Claurin, Wes Pujii, Bill Warren,
Tom Grauman, and several 0-

ed on the basketball courts. Des-
pite Dean Walker‘s conclusion in

there is a Black-White problem

numerous fights between blacks
and whites at the Complex that
had nothing whatsoever todowith
basketball. Blacks andwhitesare
frustrated. I am sorry that Mr.
Pfitsch and Iwere forced to es-
tablish the Ila-fight clause in the
early stages of the season but
we observed rather quickly that
some studentsandprofspossessa
ed little or no emorional maturv

also that l was only going by
the rules when Dennis Moss and
Bill Bailey were not permitted
to play I.M.‘s after being thrown

Brooks: $8.3 'Wishy-Washy'

To the Edit!)

I simply cannot resist thisdelis
cious opportunity to comment
upon a certain revealing letter
to the editor (Feb. 22), and upon
the S St E as a Whole. The letter
to which Irefer is from "a for
mer s a E editor who has pros-
tituted his journalistic soul for
public relations,“ congratulating

'the s a e for ”turning out a

very professional»looking news-
paper." The nature of the 5 8r I3
Style and content under the pres-
ent editorship is thus aptly desa
cribed: its journalistic soul has
also been prostituted for public
relations. The content is wishy—
\vashy and the Writing is boring
and Often inaccurate. By the
choice of subject matter to be
covered (or ignored) a distorted
image of Grinnellhasbeen creat~
ed. The most striking example
of this distortion was the neglect
of the Midwest Feminist Confer-
ence last fall, which received
only minimal attention when it
should have been considered a
major campus event (whilonear-
ly [/4 of the front page of that
issue was wasted on an offensive
and inane Cartoon about Winter
vacation.) Priorities?
A few specifics:

1) Your headlinesare consistent-
ly vague and confusing, unimagr
lnative and awkward. They donor
inform me, and usually dis—
courage the from readingthenrt-
iClC itself.

Schlesselman: lauds
Dinner

T0 the Editors:

I would like to commend Bob Ja—
cobs for his brilliant idea of the
studentefaculty progressive dinner
last Saturday. As far as I could
tell it was a great success and I
thoroughly enjoyed it. It’s a great
way to meet professors and their
families in a non-academic atmos»
phere. I also thought it was really
nice of the faculty to invite us into
their homes and feed us like kings!

I think this should become a tra—
dition at Grinnell because it’s a de-
licious way to relieve academic
pressure and find out that profes-
sors are real people.

Joy Schlesselman

2) Your cartoons display neither
wit nor good taste. If they are
meant in the tradition ofthepolir
tical cartoon, where are their
political barbs? If theyare meant
as comics, Where is their humor?
3) Need I recount the unpreceden-

ted number of errors in report-
ing which have Occurrcdthispast

The S gr B has become no more
than a P. R. rag, at about the
same journalistic level as a
small - town high school news"
paper. Even when there is a bit
of exciting news to be had, you
fail to cover it In depth. I my-
self couldn't figure out what the
hell you were talking about in
your scanty coverage of the CBS
demands last week. (Another in'
one from page tartoonl)

I do not deny that there havc
been good articles from time to
time, but the quality of these
exceptions is self - evident and
need no further commendation.
Why is it though, that the only
consistently interesting section

Bernslein: Vole Vasditk

To the Editors:

The candidacy of Terri Yasdick
for SGA vice president brings
innovation to our mmpus in the
form of representation of the
underclassmen (lower classes?).
So much of SGA information is
spread by word of mouth. Since
the SGA cabinet and joint boards
are largely comprised of upper-
classmen, the freshmen and cope
homorcsoften hear very littlepr-
esenmtion and discussion of is*
sues affecting the student body
until they are closed. Through
Terri and her friends this in*
formation could be disseminated
to a much larger percentage of
the mmpus community. In addi-
tion, lower class grievances wo-
uld be heard as it is less likely
that an underclnssman wouldfeel
intimidated talking with some—
one So close to their situation.

Terri is advocating better use
of tampus facilities. An example
may be seen In the rally wagon.

Impeachment,

Politics And
Streaking

by Fred Horecky

What relationship could there
possibly be between impeach-
merit, politics, and “streaking,“
you may rightfully ask. Ihope
to make it painfully evident to
you that such a relationshipdoes.
in fact, exist.

Following a news conference on
March 5, President Nixon fora
mally acknowledged the existence
of that latest college fad,
"streaking." When a reporter
told the President that he was
getting gray, he replied, “They
all that streaking." The Presir
dent must have been relieved to
hear good-natured gnfaws from
reporters for a change.

The President and his party,
of course, have been doing quite
a bit of “Streaking" themselves
lately. The GOP has suffered
successive defeats in Michigan,
Pennsylvania, and Ohio. AS that
immortal sage Dylanmight char
acterize Nixon's current situa-
tion, "Even the President 0!
the United States must some-
times have to stand naked."

Bite the Dust

Public ofﬁcials have laughed
this current fad off as “good
natured college fun." The Att-
omey General of Iowa, Richa
ard Turner gave “streaking“
his ofﬁcial, leyl blessing. Nike
on (Zn joke about it. That same
Attorney General was eagerly
seeking blood from eight Grinnell
College students who stripped in
protest of Playboy in 1969. That
same President used to go off
on tirades about the degredaa
tion of morals and pornography.
Have these men changed their
attitudes?

Hardly. Streaking on college
campuses is a welcome indica-
tion to these men of the Current
political mood. To cite the Des
Moines Register, "The public
finds that (Streaking) easier to
tolerate and understand than stu-
dents who want to end a war,
fight racial injustice. orpromote
some other worthy muse by ring-
ing a bell or sitting on steps or
marching down the street."

What implimtions does the cur-
rent "streaking" fad have for
campus politics? Clearly, it re-
presents part of a continuing
trend toward self indulgence and
irrational outburst. Don‘t get me
wrong. I have no objection to
naked bodies. It is simply that
“streaking" is indicative of the
apolitical mood that exists on
campuses. There has beenagen-
eral abdication of politiml res,
ponaibility.

In 1969, Grinnell College stua
dents were stripping to protest
Playboy. ,Today they strlp to ex
pose themselves in bridal shows,
logias, and the Pub. Have the
times changed? Yes, but thlsnew
form of nudity can probably be

she also plans to work for the
opening of more jobs on campus
for students. Talk to Terri this
weekend to discuss other goals
she's seeking.

Terri has shown herself to be a
good organizer and hard worker
on her floor and is anxious to
expand ‘her scope of activity. I
strongly urge your support in the
upcoming election, i.e., Take the

explained by the fact that the
calibre of Grinnell student has
been radically altered, As the
Forum bathroom graﬁtti asks,

"Have you looked at the cur-
rent freshman class .. pseudo
jocks, ﬁfties types. and arts
farts." It's not just the Fresh
man, though. The student body
generally seems to be elipsing
into degeneracy. ,

I have become very nostalgic
as of late when I hear the Jeff-
erson Airplane: "Look what's
happening in the streets, got
a revolution, got a revolution!"
Yet, those days are gone, Ifear.
The active, radical, and some
times violent sixties have been
replaced with the smug, quie—
scent, and potentially fascistic
seventies.

We ran all just very easily
"streak" our way through four
years of a Grinnell edumtion.
There is analtemative. Why don‘t
you stop and think about what
you might do to help ensure the
impeachment of Richard Nixon?
Write your congressmen. Look
around to see whats happening
on mmpus. An impeachment
symposium is being planned for
Grinnell, and plenty of volun-l
tests are needed.

Lenny Kurz and I hope to put
out a weekly column that will
deal with current political deve-
lopments, centering around the
Impeachment issue. We would
like to Offer the use of our col-
umn to any commentator of a
radical, leftist orientation Who
can signiﬁcantly contribute to
an understanding of American
political institutions.

Weil: Vole Rainer

To the Editors:

I'wish to endorse Pete Reine!
for SGA ViceaPresident. Rainer
has been one of the most effec-
tive and conscientious Student
Advisors on campus for the past
two years, and has spent this last
year serving on the counselling
committee. He is commitedto st-
rengthening the counselling ser-
vices on both the amdemlc and
personal levels.

Some people may question the
need for endorsing the only an-
didate running for office. I wish
to emphasize the importance of
voting. This year a number of
faculty members constantly cla-
lmed that our ideas were not re-
presentative of the student body
“this despite the- fact that we
were elected to represent the
students on a well articulated
platform of student advocacy. In
order to make Student Govern- ._
merit more effective with the‘
faculty, please show your sup-
port and vote for Pete Rainer.

, Sincerely,
Scott Weil
