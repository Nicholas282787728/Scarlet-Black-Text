Draft Counselling‘Cenier In Service

‘ by Jim Skarzynski

The activities of the Grinnell
Draft Counselling Center have
already begun in earnest. The
Center has an office in Room
ii in the Forum basement.
Olrrently, the officehas hours
four days a week. Office hours
are: Monday 1-3, TuesdayS-S,
Wednesday 1-3, and 7-9, and
Thursday 10‘ 12, and 375. '

The office presehtiy has four
trained counselors. However,
starting this Monday evening
meetings will be held to ac-
quaint students with the See
lective Service System. Those
interested in becoming coune
selors or those simply curious
about the working of the sys-
tem are invited to attend the
meeting or contact Jeff Fac-

teur for more information.
No assignments will be given
at the meetings, but certain
readings will be recommen-
ded.

The counselling service will
definitely play a more active
role in the students' lives
this year. By far the grear
test affectedare the freshmen.
This is because as of Julyl,
the Senate House Conference
Committee decided to abolish
all IIAS (student deferments)

cancelled.

Since inallprobability fresh‘
men will not be eligible for
student deferments, the Coun-
selling service will work pric
marily this year with Con-
scientious Objector and phye
sical deferments. Therefore,
all interested freshmen should
visit the draft counselling cen‘
ter to discuss possible ave~
nues of deferment.

However, upperclassmenare
also affected by the new lot-

and Ii-A (junior college and tery system. FDriftheirnume

vomtional) deferments. Also
the status of the ISC deferr
ment was changed. In thepast,
a student's induction was can-
celled if it interrupted a se-
mester's work. Now, an induc
tion can be postponed, but not

Requirements for a music
major have been changed to
allow each studentmore flexi-
bility in planning his own pro-
gram. Students are no longer
required to follow a set 56*
quence of courses to obtain
the major.

The fact that "more people
are coming into the departs
merit who are interested in
fields completely outside of
music" is one of the main
reasons for the new require-
ments for the music major,
according to Prof. Richard
E. Howe, chairman of the
music department.

General Majors

Howe stated that many Grin-
neil students are interested
in the major in the broad
sense rather than as specific
preparation for professional
work. Half of this year's mu~
sic majors are planning work
after, graduation thatﬁqes, not
require any specific, traditiOe
nal undergraduate preparaa
tion. These "generalmajors"
go into a "scattered group
of fields" such as socialwork
in VISTA, music libraries,
and work with civic and bur
siness organizations. The man
jors do a great variety of
things not necessarily related
to music at all.

The general revisions in the
whole college curriculum set
the precedent for the changes
in the Music department ac
cording to Prof. Howe. Ano-

ther reason is thatsix ofeigh—
teen- majors work in off
campus programs. Howe sta-
ted that “they go away, miss
two requirements, and we
don’t know what to do. The
new system facilitates off-
o‘impus study. Howe said that
he thought it was healthy to
accomodate more students
who have varied interests in
music. Howe emphasized the
importance of individualplarr
ning ofali majors.

Another reason for the re—
visions is an increasing in-
terest in specialadvanced stun
dies, Howe explained. He cir
ted several examples of ad»

vanced studieszArea Studies-
a study of the music of a
particular culture such as
non-western music or Ameri-
can music; Ethnomusicology,
a mixture of anthropology and
music centering on primitive
cultures; Aesthetics,a combi-
nation of music, philosophy
and other arts; and instrument
building which was initiated
by Prof. Wyly's work with
the harpsichord last year.
Some students have rebuilt
harpsichords in thepast. Free
fessor Jeremy Montague set
up a shop last year which
built percussion instruments.

Howe also cited an interest
In organ building.

The new Jazz offerings this
year have high enrollments,
With thirty people in Prof.
Montgomery's special topics
jazz course and eighteen per-
sons dolng special studiowork
in jazz, Prof._Howe predicted
that there will b’e‘several
Very good groups performing
jazz this semester. He said
that performances ina coffee-
house setting are planned.

Student Reoctlon

Budget cuts will hit the de-
partment in the. area of pub-
lic performances this year
with money for the series
of guest performances cut in
half. The department's ability
to buy or rent scores of con-
temporary music has been
hampered. Howe saidthat over
a long period of time this
could result in a loss of per
formance variety.

The Music department wants
to hear student reaction to the
new introductory courses in
non-western music, American
music, contemporary music,
and the Jazz courses. These
courses were announced quite
late and although enrollments
are high, the department would
like a better idea of what the
whole campus thinks.

her is above 200, they should
definitely contact the draft
counselling office in order to
cancel their [1-5 deferment.
Only those students withnum-
bers to 140 are expected to
be drafted this year. There-
fore, those students Withnum‘
bers above that will be placed
in a secondpriorirypool. The
so people will not be drafted
unless all 365 numbers of
the following yearare drafted,
and this is a highly unlikely
situation. But to be eligible
for this pool, the studentmust
cancel the IIeS' deferment.

No freshman student should
feel that he is completely
without means of deferment.
For example, Jeff mentioned
that after discussing possible
means of deferment with a
student last week, he disco-
vered that the student wore
bands on his teeth, a possible
means of deferment.

Nor shouldmost students feel
they lcnow all there is to lmow
about Selective Service proce-
dures. Thisyeartwo ovherime
portant changes were made.
The IV-A deferment which
previously deferred the sole
surviving son from military
service has been changed to
defer all family members
from service if one member
of that family died while in
service. Another important
change was made in the ap
peals procedure. Whereasbe~
fore a student's file was sent
to the state appeal board, a
student may now plead per-
sonally before the board. Sea
condly, a student may nowhave

witnesses present at his ape
veal to the local board.

Jeff emphatically states that
the Grinnell counselling ser
vice only presents the student
with his possible alternatives
concerning the draft. Nor does
the office place any pressure
on a student to accept its
advice. All decisions are the
final responsibility of the stu-
dent.

Students are encouraged to
direct their questions to a
member of the service for a
complete discussion of their
particular problem.
