by Peter Jaroff

Not everyone spent the isso’s in
suburban California surrounded by
hamburger joints and jukeboxes,
Some, like the characters in Peter
Bogdanovich’s The Last Picture
Show (1971), grew up in small,
dying towns scattered across the
American flatlands, The
“nighﬂife” consisted of a pool hall,
an allrnight cafe, and a single
movie theater. The “strip" was the
one business street in the com-
munity.

Timothy Bottoms (Sonny) and
Jeff Bridges (Duane) are the
central characters in the film‘s
tiny Texas town, attempting to
Come to grips with the desolation
which is sure to follow their lm-
pending highrschool graduation.
The closest they come to the
realization of their dreams is at the
movie house, the closest they come
to heroes is aging Sam the Lion
(well performed by Ben Johnson),

The Last Picture Show was a
stunning debut tor Bogdanovich.
whose nicely understated direction
avoids exploitation of difficult
material. The cast, which also
includes Cloris Leachman, Ellen
Burstyn, Cybil Shepherd, and
Eileen Brennan, is superb
throughout. The New Yorker
called the movie “a film for
everybody . , . a kind oi straight»
forward, involving, narrative
picture that doesn’t often get
produced anymore.” Un-
fortunately, Bogdanovich has not
lived up to the promise he
demonstrated in The Last Picture
Show. but this remarkable effort
remains, and should not be missed,

S&B
receives
thanks

To the editor: I would like to give a
special thanks to the 5&8 slaves
who for the last three years have
kept me informed on campus
activities and issues. Members of
the campus community know that
the 5&8 magically appears in their
boxes every Friday atternoon, but
few are aware of the amount of
time and energy that has gone into
that publication the week before.
Perhaps the closest analogy to
being on the paper's editorial staff
would be to that at taking an extra
class at Grinnell guaranteed to
make you pull all-nighters two
nights a week plus an additional
two to three hours of work a day
the rest of the week.

The 5&8 has done more to
promote the often talked about but
often neglected goals of “com-
‘munity awareness,” “student
input,” and “studentrfaculty-
administration-alumnirtrustee
intercommunication” than any
1 other single institution on campus.
Weekend, meal-time discussions of
the news and opinion items of the
5&8 attest to its usefulness as a
.catalyst for discussion oi college
issues. My thanks to all those
students who have taken on the
tremendous responsibility and

work involved in putting out this '

This weekend’s showing of
Breathless (1959) marks the first
time in at least four years that any
work of Jeaanuc Godard‘s has
appeared on campus. Breathless,
along with Francois Truffaut’s The
400 Blows. is the most famous of
the French “New Wave” films that
forever altered world attitude
towards the cinema This film was
Godard's first fullrlength
production, and it involved many
of the “New Wave” founders.
Breathless is based on an original
story by Truffaut. Claude Chabrol
Supervised the production, and
Raoul Coutard photographed.

Jean-Paul Belmondo launched
his career with this iilm, playing a
“Parisian cool cat" on the run
from the police He has a brief
affair with a treacherous
American girl (Jean Seberg), and
together they portray what Roger
Angeli called “two disorderly,
disconnected, nihilistic young;

Response to

To the editor: This letter is in
response to the article on EPCs in
last week’s 5&B. We feel that our
position as the Spanish EPC was
misrepresented. Although there
have been times when the taculty
and EPC members have
disagreed. we are Satisfied with
the cooperation we have received
from the faculty. The members of
the faculty have been particularly
responsive concerning curriculum
matters and they have imr
plemented a number of our
suggestions. In response to student
requests. they have willingly of-
fered their time to present projects
which were of specific interest to
them.

In conclusion. we Wish to state
that any dissatisfaction we might
have felt was due to temporary
misunderstanding, and not the lack
oi responsiveness of the laculty, as
the 5&3 article stated last week.
Laurie Rothcnberg, Carol God-
schall, and Ann Lion

To the editor:

In regard to the recent SKB
article on the attitudes of the
SEPCS: I was quoted as stating
that the economics EPC was
“listened to but not highly
regarded” and that “the EPC is

Bogdanovich debut

Godard’s ubiquitous microphoroyﬁ
successfully capture the scraps of
detail which form the background
for this modern gangster movie.

My boss politely suggestoes
several months ago that I order
Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid. and
because I don‘t relish the thought
of knocking on heaven’s door. the
film is here this weekend. You all
know the true tale of Billy the Kid,
and the record of things that he did.
He lived in New Mexico a long time
ago, when a man's only friend was
his own forty-four,

Sam Peckinpah loaded the story
with a liberal dose of knifings and
shootings, but the film lacks
the tight editing characteristic
good Peckinpah. Bob Dylan wrote
and performed for the soundtrack,
and makes his first (and last,
thank God) film appearance, Th
rest of the cast includes James
Coburn as Pat Garrett, Kris
Kristofferson as Billy, Rita
Coolidge as his girl, Slim Pickens,
and Chill Wills.

EPC article

not presendy carrying enough
weight in influencing the “out
come" of departmental decisions

Iwould like to state that neither
oi the above statements are direct,
quotes, but rather paraphrases c’
parts of a conversation I had with a
member of the Student Coors
dinator's office. The paraphrases
are also printed out of context.

The statement that the EPC wa
“listened to but not highly
regarded" was intended to convey
the idea that I believed the EPC’s
opinion had more weight with
respect to faculty evaluations than
it did with respect to hiring
procedures,

With respect to the second
statement, I believe that it is as
much, if not more, a criticism of
the student members of the EPC as
it is of the faculty—Daniel Paul
Finkellnan '

Due to a lack oi communication
between the suidcnt Coordinator‘s
otiico and the 5&3 and sum
irregularities in the interviewi , .
process. last week‘s story on EPCs
contained some crrors. We regret
tilt-in but feel that, with those
exceptions noted above, the story
adequately represents the status oi
EPCs at Grinnell.red.
