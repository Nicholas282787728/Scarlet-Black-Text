a team of the Fioneei's' talent

would lose all of its league Contests -

and linish with rather poor
statistics The team has ninth out

in total defense.

Pioneer coach Mo Hunt said he
did not think the untimely injuries
or the tough schedule were
primarily responsible tor the
team‘s disappointing season. He
said the squad lacked confidence
