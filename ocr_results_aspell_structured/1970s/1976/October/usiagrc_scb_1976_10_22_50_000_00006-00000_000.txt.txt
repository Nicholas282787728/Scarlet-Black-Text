Trustees meeting

tc-oiitiuttctl lroiii page ii

that a very poor decision was
made ,

in discussing budgetary matters
with the Trustees, the major area
we iocused on was determining
what the pi-iinarv strengths and
weaknesses of Gi .incll are. This
question led the discussion to four
general areas of concern, all of
which are directly related to
budgetary matters: ii the size ol
the faculty, 2) recreational, social,
and cultural programs
iiiing. 3) residence hall im-
movements and physical plant
maintenance, and 4) the Iood,
health, and counseling services.

The concern that was brought
to the Trustees‘ attention was that
the administration is considering
budget reductions in some or all of
these areas. it appears to us that
the administration alone is
determining what Grinnell's
budget priorities are, This is a
totally unacceptable position to
take

We urged a shirt irdm the
administration's negative outlook
oi trying to determine where cuts
should be made to a View of how
services can be improved or
maintained. The Implication ls that
the school Should be looking for
uiore funds. iinding new capital,
and increasing enrollment Also,
we pointed out that any long-term
decision made, such as the
reorganization, should be assessed
for its short-term impact,

While we must continue to
persist in our attempts to develop
some way oi maintaining the
current quality oi social, cultural,
and recreational programming,
and shall Continue to work towards
and insist that the College develop
a meaningiul Attirmative Action
policy, we are concerned about our
role in decisionrmaking at the
College, and particularly what our
role is with regard to discussing
and implementing the ideas which
grow out of the White Paper
discussion. The general issue of
student input is being discussed at
the Workshop on Student input
being conducted by s.G.A, with
President Turner and Deans
Walker and Tederman.

In addition to raising concerns
about the reorganization and the
White Pupcl'. two concerns were
presented regarding speciiic
student services on campusithe
Health Center and the residence
halls

With regard to the residence
halls, we reiterated the importance
oi residence hall improvements
both in terms oi physical
deterioration of the halls and in
terms of the need to tailor the use
oi space more closely to the needs
of Grinllell students. Specific
reference was made to the study
conducted last semester of the
student body which indicated that
a signiticant majority oi students
would like to have separate arcas
within their living space in lihich
to sleep and study,

We made a more detailed
presentation regarding the almost
total lack oi services provided by
the Health Center. Several
problem areas were presented.
The first was the reduction of hours
at the Health Center from 24 hour
nursing care to 12 hour nursing
care We Indicated that the Student
monitors were so restricted and
the limits on who could stay over
night were so tight as to make the
Health Center almost totally
worthless, particularly in terms of
overnight care. We asked that
hours be expanded to the previous
level We were also disturbed by
the lack of educational services
available at the Health Center and
proposed that the Health Center
should be providing courses in iirst
aid, nutrition, personal hygiene.
Cardio-Pulminary Resuscitation,
and a variety of other related

courses in the health field.

Finally with regard to the Health
Service, we emphasized the need
for having a doctor on campus. A
doctor, even partstirne, seems to be
necessary because town doctors
are already too busy. because they
don't make house calls, and
because they are not readily
available in emergency situations.
We ielt that bringing a
gynecologist on campus would be
particularly important. as women
on campus currently have to go all
the way to Des Moines for
gynecological services.

On the White Paper specifically,
we responded to each oi the seven
areas raised by President Turner,
The positions expressed reilected
the views of the Cabinet and were
also designed as a starting point
for student discussion.

1) We believe that Grinnell
Should continue to maintain ethnic,
socioeconomic, and geographic
diversity, as well as continuing to
draw students from other coun-
tries. We believe that thls diversity

is one at the features that attracts
students.

) We believe that the College
has a significant impact on the
personal growth and development
of each student, whether it would
like to or not, ' In
order to increase the likelihood of a
positive impact, we bleievethat the
Academic Advtsing structure, the
Counseling structure (R A.’s and
sits). and the general orientation
oi the College towards personal
growth and development must be
examined.

3) We believe that “shared cx-
pericnce” is a healtliyconcept and
one which Grinnell should dedicate
itself to, We believe that Shared
experience occurs through such
things as convocations and faculty
student coiiee hours,

We believe that
core courses may represent a
greater loss than the advantages
they provide, through the reduch
tion of faculty time and ﬂexibility,
and through the introduction of
greater requirements and the
resulting loss ofsstudcnt control
over their schedules.

4) We endorse the notion that
Grinnell should make more of an
eiiort to relate what happens at
Grinnell to the outside world and
These experiences could be ac
complished through the one
Couragement of internships with
alums and Trustees, through the
use oi adjunct professorships,
through the awarding of credit for
practical or extracurricular at»
tivities, through increased spons
sorship or joint iaculty-student
research projects, and through a
renewed commitment to relating
theoretical discussions in the
classroom to practical events
outside of Grinnell At the same
time, we don't think that Grinnell
should become a vocational or
eveii a pre-proiessional school,

5) With regard to devoting more
attention to the problems or a
global society, we believe that the
College should sustain and enhance
it 5 financial commitment to the
presentation of expert speakers on
many subjects and should continue
to bring symposia to campus on
topics oi current interest,

6) We believe that Grinncll
already is distinctive and that we
should capitalize on our strengths.
Among our selling points are our
student-faculty ratio, an
already substantial commitment
to quality student services, a
unique social. cultural, and
recreational program. and a highly
qualified and accessible faculty.

7) Finally, ah yes. a joyiul
community. What can we say”
Grinnell has been a joyful com»
munity in the past, and in tact
continues to be joyful in some
ways. We disagree with those who
say that it just happens however. A
joytul community requires an
effort, it requires trust, it requires
communication. and it requires
sensitivity to the needs and per
speetives of each oi the par
ticipants, This is what is lacking at
Grinnell today, and we all have to
make an effort to make Grinnell
truly joyous once again.

Ms. Bucksbaum summarized the
trustee sentiment, “While no at»
iicial Trustee position was ar-
ticulated, we listened with great
interest and much care to the
presentations, both in committee
meetings and at lunch,” Ruth
Montgomery expressed the view
that “the Trustees definitely
seemed impressed by what we
were telling them. but they also
indicated that they are not at this
point prepared to act on what we
said. it seems like it's a storing-up
