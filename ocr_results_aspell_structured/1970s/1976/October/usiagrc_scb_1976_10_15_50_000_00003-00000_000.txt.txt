Some people collect stamps,
some coins. some bugs. There are
people who attend Star Trek
conventions, There really are such
things as flea circuses. sword
swallowers and bearded ladies. 0n
Loose 2nd there is a guy named
Lawrence Brow. An'unassuming
type, he is a seventeen-year-old
Grinnell freshman from Madison.
Wisconsin. Larry, however, has a
penchant for hitting people as hard
as he possibly can with swords and
clubs.

No, this is not an expose oi S&M
on the Grinnell campus. Larry is a
member of the Society for Creative
Anachronism, lnc. Periodically,
Larry and some fellow society
members get together at tourr
naments, don authentically
reproduced medieval garb and tor
the sheer pleasure of it, whack at
each other with swords. The
swords are actually made out ol a
sturdy, yet pliant, imported wood
called rattan. The helmets worn
are made from old freon tanks
which are cut, shaped, and padded
to fit the specifications of one’s
head. Pads which cover all areas oi
the body are mandatory and Larry
claims the matches are very sale.
These tournaments are generally
attended by anywhere from so to
150 people.

The SCA was formed eleven
years ago in that hotbed of
radicalism, Berkeley, Caliiornia.
it is a nonprofit organization
which was initially started by
history students who were in-
terested in doing some research
through actual experience,
Various estimates place the
group’s current membership at
anywhere irom 5,000 to 10,000
members.

The Society divides the con-
tinental United States into four
separate kingdoms. These are: the
Western Kingdom (which covers
the West Coast), the Eastern
Kingdom (basically the north
Atenveldt
(literally the Kindom ol' the Sun,
which stretches from Arizona to
Florida). and the Middle Kingdom
(covering the area roughly bor-
dered by Kansas and Wyoming to
Ohio. Tennessee and Canada).
Each kingdom is subdivided into
principalities. provinces, baronies,
cantons and Shires (which is the
basic three-person unit). cover.
ning this whole medieval universe
is a Board oi Directors more

ycoloriully known as the Imperial

Seat. Each area has basic oiiicers
which keep the organization

i running as smoothly as any feudal

state,

There is a method to all this
madness, The Society’s intention is
to recreate, as close to reality as
possible, the medieval liiestyle oi
any typical 14th or 15th century
lord or lady. The by-product oi all
this insanity is a lot oi fun and
some interesting historical insight.
Many arts of the Middle Ages such
as mead~making (a sweet honeys
winel. cartography, weaving and
the making oi drinking horns are
explored. Each member adopts a
fictitious medieval personality,
researches the background oi this
person, and becomes him or her at
Society iunctions. Because oi the
general intellectual bent of this
pursuit, the combative aspect of
the tournaments has become
nothing more than an interesting

sidelight. Generally, the primarily
college-age students just get
together and speak of Dark Ages
type topics. (Example: Lord to his
lady: “I find the peasants to be
revolting." Serf A to Seri B: “The
King sure is strong. he’s the only
guy i know who can swim the moat
lengthwise")

Larry is one oi the son members
who is still “into” pugilism. At
tournaments, he assumes the
identity oi Lars Vilhjalmsson, a
10th century Viking irom the House
ii Twelve Tongues.

His interest has reached the
extent that he is currently com-
pleting a chain mail vest. At this
point, it needs sleeves and a bit
more length, but Larry already
looks simply stunning in his 25

pounds of 14 gauge galvanized

Tournaments are held, in dif-
terent areas, about once every
three to four months. There are
two crown tournaments every year
where the best fighter becomes the
Crown Prince. Six months later,
his coronation is held and he
becomes King oi his particular
kingdom, Each knight is tighting
(by prior agreement) ior a lady. li
he becomes King, she lollows him
to the top as Queen. Each contest is
scored by the honor system. That
is, it is up to the person being hit to
honestly say Whether it would have
been a telling blow or not. A smack
on the arm means the loss of the
use of that arm, which must be
placed behind the Victim’s back. A

people not accepted are those
interested in the occult, Le. witches
or wizards. Larry said the society
does notwantto get involvedin any
possibly delicate religious aspects.

While at Grinnell and without
any transportation, Larry hopes to
keep his hand in his hobby by
possibly starting a local SCA
chapter. Within six short weeks, he
has already coerced his roommate
into “going at it" in the courtyard
between Loose and Read. His next
idea for a creative project is to
build his own set oi plate armor.
Larry’s hobby has met with ac-
ceptance here and at his home
where his parents allow him to
pursue this activity because u

bash on the leg puts the fighter
down on one knee. Head and chest
shots are killing blows. Anybody
who has seen Monty Python and
the Search {or the Holy Grail will
recognize the realism inherent in
this scoring system.

One must be able to effectively
spar with a knight beiore being
eli ble for tournament com-
petition, and women are now
eligible for combat. There are all
kingdom tournaments once per
year and once in a while the Middle
Kingdom will wage war with its
Eastern counterpart. For iun,
Arizona occasionally raids
Caliiornia. People very rarely get
hurt. the worst injury Larry has
seen being a broken collar bone.
Larry says that it you are ”real
good, you don't even get touched.”

Larry enjoys the people he has
met through the organization and
has been a member for tweaand-
a-hali years. He regretiully notes
that some people join the
organization ior its escapist
aspect, but doesn't feel this to be
the norm. Mostly, the ranks consist
oi intelligent college students who
are academically interested in
medieval culture, but this does not
exclude an occasional pipe litter
and male nurse. The Middle
Kingdom King raises flies to test
pesticides on. The only type oi

cycle it’s OK,” In fact, his [oilf-
ieen~yearold sister has joined the
group. With Larry’s initiative,
chivalry might well return to all
Gothic campus and the girls in
Gates may tinallyJind some real
knights in shining armor.
