The ssbls continuing saga of the
committee structure at Grinnell
leaps forward this week to look at
five more committees: Admissions
and Student Financial Aid,
T‘ibrary, Physical Education, and
Student Publications and Radio

(all standing committees of the
faculty) and Public Events (an ad

committee)
' Some of these committees work
merely in an advisory capacity,
while others have more power to

t and make decisions. None have

gular meeting times. and
although all meetings are open to
anyone interested in attending.
meetings are not publicized in any
way.

The function of the Admissions
and Student Financial Aid com-
mittee is primarily to advise the
Director of Admissions and
Financial Aid, It also serves as a
“forum for discussion,” according
Q committee member Gene
Wubbels. for any problems or ideas
related to these areas. This year
the group has considered the

‘.ement of Admissions Stan-

rds, recommended that the
Black Admissions Board be
abolished, and interviewed can-
didates for the post of director of

issions, making a recomr
niendatiun t0 the administration
They have also discussed ad-
missions in general. including
trends in admission and this year’s
admissions effort. The com-
mittee has no power to act or make
decisions; however, they do make
recommendations to President
Turner. The actual job of ad.
missions (reviewing aDDlications.
etc.) is done by the Admissions

mented member Jeil Beller. He
and Mr. Wubbels both feel that the

mmittee is fulfilling its function,

“could do a lot more," as

bbels put it. He would like to see
more people involved in the ad-
missions process, particularly
students and alumni.

The Physical Education Com»
mittee is also involved in hiring a
new person; in this case, someone
to replace Sandy Hoth. They have
interviewed one candidate so far.
As with the admissions committee,

the tWo meetings they've had this
year they ve discussed the
women‘s basketball program,

Jepsen admits that the com-
mittee‘s functions are not that
broad or important, but believes
that “it’s an important vehicle to
have” in that it serves as an extra

agency to help discuss problems,
The committee has been more
active in previous years, he noted,
For instance. the policy on
women’s sports was formulated
through the committee.

As with most other committees,
meetings are open, but students
are unaware of them. Both Jepsen
and committee member Virginia
Munoz think the committee is
basically fulfilling its function.
However, Munoz feels that the
committee should have more of a
voice in interscholastic affairs. “1
thinkit could do more,” she stated.
She would like to see “more
frequent and regular meetings.”

The Library Committee also acts
mainly in an advisory capacity.
They approve the allotment of the
book budget drawn up by Librarian
Christopher McKee. They also
discuss student complaints and
various library policies, This year
the Whole committee has met three
times.

Davida Alperin feels the com-
mittee acts as a safeguard.
although main processes could
continue without it, “We could be
doing more if more people thought
of coming to us with suggestions
and criticisms," she added. “We
can’t go in and turn the library
upside down without knowing
specific complaints,” However.
Chairman Dennis Perri believes
the committee is accomplishing
everything of which it is capable.
“I haven't found any particular
issue that the committee should be
dealing with but doesn’t have the
power to act upon," he stated.

Students on the Committee also
function separately as an EPC.
They write evaluations of
librarians, conduct student sur-

veys and interview potential
library staff members.

The Student Publications and
Radio Committee is essentially the
publisher of the college. It deals
with the budget alloted by SGA to
the 5&3, Grinnell Book, and KDIC.
It also deals with extra money
from subscriptions, revenues, and
patrons. $18,000 is given by SGA to
the three publications, which
constitutes only half of their total
operating costs. sport tries to
make sure each publication sticks
to its budget, and also tries to make
sure that the jobs are done. In no
way do they inﬂuence content.

“I think the committee’s worked
hard this year to be financially
responsible [or the publication,”
Schondelmeyer stated. He in-
dicated that part of the problem of
past years has been that not
enough effort has gone into
planning the initial budget. He
believes that the committee should
have its own reserve fund for
unforeseen situations,

The committee meets often,
although not on a regular basis.
Recently. they redrew the budget
for KDIC. Meetings are not
publicized, but any student wishing
to attend should contact Ruth
Montgomery.

Last year’s Public Events
Committee planned three cultural
events ufthe 1975-76 season on their
$13,000 budget: the Manhattan
Proiect, the Tibetian Folk Opera.
and the “I Musici di Roma”
Chamber Orchestra. This year’s
committee will plan next year's
events after they receive their
budget from SGA. So far, the
committee has Worked on
publicity, posters, and tickets for
this year’s events.

John R. Hopkins, chairman of
admissions operations at Syracuse
University, New York, has been
appointed admissions dean, said
Dean Waldo Walker.

Hopkins will take over ad-
missions on July 1 when Nicholas
Ryan will step down. Ryan, who
submitted his resignation last
summer, will remain dean of
Student Financial Aid.

A native easterner, Hopkins has
served as assistant and associate
director of admissions at Svracuse.
Hopkins received his BA, degree
in Latin from the College of Liberal
Arts at Syracuse and his M. A.
from the University of Illinois in
1965 and 1957, respectively.

Starting a small alumni program
in admissions and gearing so.
missions publications toward
different stages of prospective
student interest were two ideas,
Hopkins suggested, as possible for
inclusion in the Grinnell ad-
missions program.

ln a telephone interview this
week. Hopkins explained that
starting to build a small group of
alumni who are well informed can

be influential in admissions and
career development. Syracuse has
done this successfully, said
Hopkins. This alumni group would
be expected to infuse enthusiasm
and the personal touch into the
community, where prospectives
are, and provide access to any
information requested, he said,

Admissions material distributed
to prospective students should be
geared toward their interest, while
presenting the college honestly,
Hopkins said. For example,
Hopkins explained that a high
school junior shouldn't be sent
material on curriculum when his
interest, at that point, is probably
atmosphere. Once the student has
applied, curricular information
should be supplied, Hopkins said.

impressed With Grinnell on his
three day visit. Hopkins noted that
everyone on campus seemed
generally concerned with the
“college going in the right direca
tion,”

Ryan called Hopkins a ”super
guy with good Judgment." Ryan
liked Hopkins‘ approach and stress
on the prompt personal touch with
students.
