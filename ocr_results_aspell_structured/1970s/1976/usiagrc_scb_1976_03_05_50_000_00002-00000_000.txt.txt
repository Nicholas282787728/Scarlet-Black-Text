Trustees discuss concerns,

The Board of Trustees held the second of their three yearly
meetings last weekend. Launching a fundraising campaign,
tenure, admissions and dorm improvements were the major
items discussed.

SGA representatives Matt Cohen, Pam Curry and Kathy
Kramer discussed dorm improvements and budgetary cuts
with the Board. “We were Well accepted," commented
Curryi According to President A. Richard Turner, the
trustees are very concerned about dorm improvements

Kramer explained that the students discussed quantitive
versus qualitiative budgetary cuts with the trustees, She said
that quantitive decisions shouldn't be the only considerations
when making budget cuts and that there seems to be a lack of
student input into budgetary decisions.

According to Cohen, “The trustees were receptive to the
need for greater communication between the trustees and
the student body." Cohen. Curry and Kramer plan to send
letters to the trustees thanking them for their interest. Cohen
said that he hopes that information about different aspects of
campus life and student feelings about them can be sent to
the trustees in a few weeks.

Late Wednesday afternoon, a couch in Drew Bergman and
Bill Black’s room on Dibble third caught fire. According to
Bergman, the couch, which was made out ot strawrlike
material covered with synthetic cloth, was next to a heated
radiator causing it to ﬂame up. The curtains in the room
immediately caught fire, also. According to Bergman, “A
whole bunch of students got together and put it out. There
was a lot oi teamwork involved.” Fire extinguishers were
used and the ﬂaming couch was thrown out the window.
Bergmansaid thatpart of the wall and radiator in their room
was blackened. “I realized that the couch would get hot
sometimes,” commented Bergman. “But, i really didn‘t
think it was going to burn. it kind oi shocked me.”

As a part oi Budweiser's national “Clean-Up" campaign,
the Grinnell Beverage Co., inc., has offered to supply a truck
to take paper to a recycling plant in Ames, if a student or
groups of students can be found to coordinate the effort. The
project would be entered in the nationwide contest which is
offering $1000 and $500 cash awards to the conductors of such
projects Dick Pastels. oi the Grinnell Beverage Co., inc.,

According to a proposal by
Haines' Haleroordinator Bob
Tracy, “the hall Coordinator's
office should be an umbrella
agency for social, recreational,
and service activities within and
throughout the residence halls." In
addition to the redefinition of the
hall Coordinator’s role, Tracy's
plan calls for the establishment of
a Campus Coordinators’ Com»
mittee to Coordinate and direct the
efforts of the hall Coordinators and
also suggests that the hall coorr
dinators be chosen by a selection
committee. Tracy cites two
problems in the present situation
which prompted the proposed
changes: 1) the nonacademic
environment is left too much to
chance, and 2) very little
deliberateness and direction is in
the definition of the hall Coor-
dinators’ duties.

Under the new guidelines the hall
Coordinators' responsibilities
would be: a) to serve as hall liaison
with campus organizations; b) to
direct publicity for activities; c) to
help develop projects in and be
tween halls: d) to administer hall
funds; ande) to represcnt the halls

Hall rep change proposed

on the Campus Coordinators'
Committee.

The Campus Coordinators’
Committee is necessary, says
Tracy, because oi the need for
more dialogue between halls, The
committee would be composed oi
the hall coordinators, two mem-
bers of the Student Affairs staff,
and would be chaired by the
student coordinator. it would have
four basic functions: a) to serve as
advice and support group for hall
coordinators, b) to facilitate
organization or, all-campus
projects, c) to work with SGA
students coordinating committees,
and d) to conduct hall coordinator
workshops.

Tracy proposes that the hall
coordinators be selected rather
than elected to ensure that
qualified people are chosen, He
thinks that the selection process
could become much like that used
for Student Advisors,

The Student Affairs Office and
the Student Coordinator‘s Office
both support the proposal. Student
Coordinator Matt Cohen sees two
beneiits from Tracy's proposal,
First, it provides a structure by
which hall Coordinators can work

together to improve inter-darn
relations as well as stretching the
dollars allocated to dorms. Second

between the student coordinator,
hall coordinators, and dorm

0n the whole Cohen believes the
suggested method of selecting hall
coordinators is an improvement
over the present system. His only
concern is that the original
proposal includes no mechanism
for removing hall coordinators, but
he added that this aspect could '16

is taken,

Tracy will be present at two open
discussion sessions next week to
discuss the proposal They will be
held Monday at 10:30 pm and
Tuesday at ti p.m., in Haines

proposal will be prcsented to SGA.

Recommend therapy survey;

by Elaine Ashbaugh

Poweshiek County’s Mental
Health Clinic provides therapy for
approximately to per cent of
Grinnell College’s student body as
well as for permanent residents of
the area, Through the college’s
financial arrangements with the
clinic, students may receive five
free therapy sessions, although
fees, roughly $20 per hour, lor
subsequent visits must be paid
entirely by students.

Students come to the clinic in one
of two ways. Most otten, a resident
advisor or counselor in the
college's Office of Student Affairs
refers a student to this form of
therapy. Students may contact the
Mental Health Clinic on their own.
however, it they prefer.

Recently, the college‘s in-
termediary function and the clinic
itself have been under Cons
sideratinn by both the Counseling
Committee and some individual
students. Partially. the 30 per cent

evaluation of the program.

Committee members suggest
that a greater use by students of
on-campus counselors may ac
count for the decreased use of the
mental health clinic, Dr. John
Daniels, director of the clinic,
thinks that the clinic does not have
enough contact with the college,
especially with such counselors as
the resident advisors and Student
Affairs personnel. At a Counseling
Committee meeting Tuesday
morning, it was decided that these
and other questions and problems
would be submitted for response to
students. who have received
clinical service,

A semirformalized survey sheet
will be compiled by two members
of the Counseling Committee and
submitted to the committee for
recommendations of changes and
ultimate approval. Approximately
five weeks before the end of the
semester, Health Clinic officials
will distribute survey forms to
students who have used the clinic.

direct and direct clinical services
during the last July to January
period. As Committee Chairmayw
Rick DiBello stresses, unless tht.’
survey shows anything really
drastic, no foreseeable changes
will take place. He considers the
program an integral part of the
college and believes that the
college's feeling oi responsibility
toward the students lies behind the
continuation oi the program.
