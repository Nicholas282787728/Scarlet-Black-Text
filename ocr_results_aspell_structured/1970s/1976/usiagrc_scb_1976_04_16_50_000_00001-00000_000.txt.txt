Health Center
:changes staff

by Janet Pope
Wednesday, President A,
Richard Turner and Dean Waldo
y \ Walker made the final decision to
goiter the Health Center schedule.
llealth Center hours for next year
will be a rim. to a pm. Monday
through Friday. 10 am. to 3 pm.
on Saturday, and if a nurse is
available. irom noon to 3 pm
Sunday, At all other times a
student clerk will be on duty.

Because registered nurses will
not be on duty 24 hours a day,
students requiring a nurse’s care
will have to go to Grinnell General

g. Hospital, because they will not be
gable to spend the night in the
‘ Health Center.

The revision was made due to a

$10 000 cut in the Health Center

‘5 budget, Speaking about the

ithange, Irma Hall, administrative
supervisor of the Health Center,
said, "1 am genuinely sorry that it
has to be done." However, she said
that personnel was the only area
where substantial cuts could be
made.

Ralph Pomerenk, director of
college services, looks at the
situation lrom another angle.
According to him, the nurses at the
Health Center are ”terribly un-

. derutilized,” ”Most ACM schools
.are doing what we’re proposing,"
he stated. “We're Just coming to
grips with it now.”
_ Student clerk duties will be
limited, according to Pomerenk.
Clerks will handle calls made to
the Health Center, make
arrangements for transportation to
the hospital, and care for students
‘ who do not need a nurse’s care but
wish to sleep in the Health Center.

Pomerenk said that he hopes to
hire eight or ten students for clerk
positions. “We hope to get them
lined up tor this spring and 'give
them some instruction so they will
be ready to go in the fall,” he ex.
plained.

Hall said that doctors in town
have been Consulted and are not
opposed to the proposed changes.
Pomerenk said that students will
be encouraged to go to their RA’s

.Ur‘or assistance with medical
problems.

The proposal includes a sentence
‘ stating that when an epidemic

strikes the college community, the
Health Center Will be temporarily
staffed 24 hours a day.

Also included in the proposal is a
"yetipulation that the new schedule
‘ will be evaluated betore the end'of

first semester next year. “If

' a higher pre

changes need to be made, they will
be made," commented Hall. She
continued saying, “I would hope
that everybody could approach it
(the new schedule) positively and
give it a chance,”

Early this semester, Pomerenk
informed the Health Subcommittee
of Walker’s decision to cut the
Health Center budget. According
to Russ Damtoft, student member
of the subcommittee, Pomerenk
recommended that the cuts be
made in personnel.

Damtoft said that after
questioning Pomerenk about the
Health Center budget. it was ap-
parent that personnel was the only
area that could be Cut without
making a drastic change in the
present services.

When the subcommittee meeting
was held to make a final recom-
mendation, Damtoft was the only
student member that showed up at
the meeting with Pomerenk and
Hall. He did not fight against the
main thrust of the proposal. Alter
discussing the change, Damtoft
said that he did not oppose having
clerks on duty at night. He said he
would go along With such a change
because he believes student sera
vices comparable to this year will
be provided at the same cost.

However, Damtoft said that the
reduced weekend hours do bother
him, “I tried to get more weekend
hours (at the meeting with
Pomerenk and Hall), but I was up
against a stone wall,” he said.

Damtoft was able to get a
paragraph included in the proposal
stating that the college will pay
any hospital room and board ex.
penses which insurance will not
cover. This would occur when a
doctor says that the student would
have been able to stay in the Health
Center ifit was stafled by nurses 24
hours a day.

Turner and Walker added to this
part of the proposal, stating that
the college will pay hospital costs
when needed until they are able to
review insurance arrangementsror
the 1977-73 school year.

Pomerenk said that the in-
surance policy will stay the same
for next year. However, the
lollowing year the college will
probably offer an optional plan, he
said. Right now, Pomerenk exa
plained that the college requires
everyone to take a minimal plan,
which is included in the com-
prehensive fee. A change would
provide ahrller optional plan with

Yearbook dies

byJanetPope

Last week, the Student
Publications and Radio Committee
voted to discontinue the
publication of the yearbook at
Grinnell. Lack of student interest
was the primary and immediate
reason lor the decision. “Having no
applicants for yearbook editor. we
voted to have no yearbook,” ex-
plained Gordon Brown, editor of
The Grinnell Magazine and
professional adviser to the year-
book.

However,sincethatdecisionwas
made, sophomores Carin Depree
and Van Tsagaris have expressed
interest in co—editing next year's
book. According to Brown, the
committee has not yet decided
whether to reconsider their
previous vote.

Depree said she was ready and
willing to edit a yearbook next
year. “We can do it," stated
rsagaris. “We have a bunch of
people that are willing to do it.
They know it’s alot of Work. But we
don't know if the committee will
reopen it."

Last night at room draw 325
people signed a petition expressing
support for the yearbook, Depree
said. “I guess onlyabout 500 people
go through room draw, so it was a
pretty sizeable portion,” she
commented.

Both Brown and Brent Schon-
delmeyer, committee chairperson,
expressed doubt about whether
SGA would be willing to allot
adequate funds for next year's
book. Finance committee mem
bers are citing the answers of the
approximately 160 students who
have responded to a recent budget
survey, distributed by the com-
mittee just after spring break.
Many students rated a yearbook
low on a priorities list.

In '65366, Grinnell's yearbook
was sent to the publishers who in
turn contacted the administration,
stating that they believed certain
portions were potentially libelous,
said Ruth Prescott. associate
director of college relations.

The manuscript and photographs '
were returned to President Glenn
Leggett, Prescott recalls, and were
given to the college lawyer, who
found 32 instances of potential
libel, Prescott explained. After
receiving the lawyer’s report,
administrators decided not to
publish the book, Prescott con-
tinued.

in ‘67—’63 two books were
published, each with a different
approach, according to Brown. The
next year, another Cyclone was
published. In ‘69770 and ‘70-’71, no
yearbook was published at Grin-
nell.

Then in ‘71-’72, Neal Trabich and
his staff obtained student monies,
sold ads and contracted a printer in
Montezuma to produce the book,
explained Brown. This book met its
costs and according to Brown, was
wellreceived by students.

Also editing the book the
iollowing year, 'l‘rabich and his
staff incurred a debt. The ad
ministration, SGA and the

,' publications : committee made an

agreement to put the yearbook
under the jurisdiction of the
committee. Brown was named
adviser and guidelina were set up
requiring a yearbook staff to
submit a budget to the committee
and pay off the debt, Brown said.

The ’73-’74 yearbook, edited by
Glenn Sigmund and Marvin
Barnes, met its costs, made its
payment on the previous year’s
debt and paid staff salaries, Brown
reported.

The following year, after
graduation, when the yearbook
was not completed, Barnes took
materials with him over the
summer and continued to send
pages to the publisher, Brown
related. However, Brown said
there were still pages missing at
the beginning of school this year.

During me fall, according to
Schondelmeyer, a letter was
received from the publisher saying
that materials were missing from
the book. During October, several
students completed the missing
sections.

The book was ﬁnally released at
the beginning of this semester.
”Due largely to the efforts of Jim
Freeman (this year’s circulation
manager) all the books are sold,"
reported Brown.

However, the book went $2500
in debt according to Robert An~
derson, college treasurer. Along
with the S900 deficit still left from
the 7217;} book, the total yearbook
debt amounts to a sizeable sum.
Anderson said that he would like to
see a book continue, subject to the
budget controls initiated this year,
because that is the only way the
debt can be paid.

in October, when examining the
iinancial records of ’75-'76 year-

book, edited by Barnes, Schon-
delmeyer said that the committee
found evidence of financial
mismanagement and improper
budgeting. Schondelmeyer also
said, “It seemed that the person
who was editor was not spending
the time it would take to put the
book out."

This fall, communication links
between Barnes, the rest of the
staff and the publications coma
mittee were very poor, according
to Brown.

The committee met on October
23 to discuss the performance of
the editor. They met again on
November 4 with Barnes, “He was
there and he tendered a
resignation,” stated Schen—
delmeyer. He said the editor told
the committee that he could no
longer operate as editor because
the committee kept questioning his
authority.

Subsequent to Barnes‘
resignation, Schondelmeyer said
the committee discussed whether
they wanted to publish a book.
After deciding affirmatively, the
committee requested applications,
hired a staff and prepared a new
budget contract with Josten’s-
American Yearbook Company.
“We also made efforts to put the
book under closer financial
scrutiny," Schondelmeyer said.

Presently John Lam, editor, and
Lucy Rosendahl, associate editor,
are in charge of putting out a
smallerrsize yearbook. Both are
optimistic about its prospects.

“They met their first deadline
and are presently working on their
second one,” commented Brown.
“The material 1 approved for the
first deadline is excellent. it’s
looking good.”
