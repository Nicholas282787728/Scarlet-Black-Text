The Grinnell men's track season
will commence tomorrow at»
ternoon. April 10, as the Pioneers
host the Morgan Taylor In
vitational Track Meet. In all, some
l_4 teams are expected to par-
ticipate in the meet, Coach Mo
Hunt commented that Grinnell
“may not look as good as we really
are, because many oi the per-
formers have not reached their full
potential ”

‘I-Iunt pointed out that the
Pioneers Will probably not score
heavily in the early meets. “We
have some good performers," he
said, “but We don’t yet have the
depth that you need." He con-
tinued, "I think it will take us a
While |o develop that. depth, but we
should be able to achieve it,”

At this early point in the season,
Hunt was slightly hesitant about
naming any of those he expected to
consistently pertorm well for
Grinnell, but he did drop a few
names oi men who should tigure
prominently in the Pioneer
scoring Among those be men
tioned were Ken Green and Mark
Schultz in the sprints, Mike
Nadalsky and Lincoln Marshall in
the triple jump, and in hurdles,
Steve Bolesta and Dale Lamb

About the middle and long
distance runners, Hunt was unr
sure. “I can’t. tell just now who is
going to run what or how they are
going to run," he commented
Wednesday. “After things settle
down a little, We'll know more what
to expect. I don’t know how we’ll
stand in relation to some of the
other teams.” he added.

Hunt’s plans were shaken up a
little bit more at last Wednesday’s
practice. During a lime-trial
running oi Ihe too-yard dash,
ireshman sprinter Tim Caver
pulled up with a pulled muscle. The

practice came to an early finish. as
Hunt did not wish to risk another
injury to his team in the slightly
Chilly afternoon. Caver is lost for
the Morgan Taylor meet and it is
uncertain when he will be able to
return to action. Hunt has been
raced with the problem oi iinding
two more runners for the mile-
relay squad, oi which Cover was a
likely member. Hunt had
previously been searching ior just
one more runner for the relay,

Coach Hunt Stated that this will
be an “especially tough week, ;
since we have meets back-to-back, ‘
so to speak.“ Following Saturday's
Morgan Taylor meet, the Pioneers
travel to Dskaloosa for the William ‘

There are a lot oi elbows in action in this rugby picture, but owners
oi those joints are occupied by more passive activities than the very
physical game of rugby. After last Sunday's Rugby Club opener
Grinnell and UNI got together tor the traditional sharing oi the keg.
Although losing to um in the rugby match, Grinnell more than held
their own in the keg draining session atterwards. Tomorrow and
Sunday the Rugby Club is away, but next weekend the club returns
home tor a match with the Des Moines “a" team. Heads will roll and

beer will ilow again—that's rugby!

opener

by Bob Meyer

Last Tuesday the Grinnell
College goliteam opened its season
with a last place finish in the
Grinnell College Best Ball In-
vitational. Eight other teams were
represented, with the University oi
Northern Iowa the victor,

By “best ball" is meant that
each school has three two-man
teams represent their school The
score tor the squad is counted by
taking the better score between the
two players ior each oi the
eighteen holes. The school's final
score is the summation of the three
tworman teams’ scores.

Grinnell's three teams were: I)
sophomore Mike Hopkins and
freshman Rich Fendler; 2)
sophomore Dave Vanderpool and
junior Larry Callison; and 37
freshmen Frank Halley and Matt
Kaplan, Grinnell‘s final score of
225 was seventeen strokes away
from the winning UNI total.

Coach Edd Bowers did not ex-
pect much from his young team
which only has two returning
upperclassmeniboth oi whom are
only sophomores, Bowers believes
that as the season progresses the
golf team will do better than their
last place finish of last Tuesday,

The coach is pleased With the
play oi Hopkins, Vanderpool, and
Kaplan Their individual scores
were among the ten best of the
invitational. They received little
help irom their partners, however.
This lack of help is one of Bowel's‘
major concerns. Bowers does not
look iorward to an impressive
team record, but he feels that this
year’s experience Will improve his
young goliers ior tuture seasons.

The squad's next match is away
at Coe Tuesday. There will be [our
schools at the match: Cos, Cornell,
Grinnell. and Knox.

Seven backs. Points are scored on

equivalent oi a touchdown in

The game is a cross between
soccer and American football,

developed from rugby. it is played
with a ball the approximate shape
of a football but 2“: times the size,
The sport contains many in

these mean and more I suggest
