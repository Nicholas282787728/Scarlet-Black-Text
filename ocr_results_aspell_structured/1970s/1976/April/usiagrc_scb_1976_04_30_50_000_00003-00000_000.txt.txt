’ Hackes urges involvement

by Doug Schultz

After running the gauntlet of
Washington political shenanigans,
power plays and a bit more mud
included, all from a Washington
media perspective, iormer
Grinnellian Peter Hackes, of NBC
News, Washington D.C. concluded
his discussion Monday night tin
South Lounge) on an optimistic
note He urged Americans to take a
“get involved” approach to
American politics.

Hackes stressed that the way to
make American politicians keep
their promises is through a “doeite
yourseli democracy."

This implies getting involved not
just at the national or state level,
but locally, in Poweshiek County—
making sure “good, honest
politicians" are put in othce, for
county attorney, county sherili,
state representatives, etc.

To do that, Hackes stressed the
effectiveness ofletters to the editor
and to Congressmen. Contrary to
popular beliel ”Candidates and TV
management do read letters" and
do pay attention to them. The need
for citizens to influence media
would seem all the more important
it, as l-lackes claimed, “television
will be the single, most important
tool not only in the upcoming
election, but in shaping luture

[attitudes about defense, enert-ZV.
' environment, and ioreign policy.“

The fact that Americans are
once again getting involved in an
election after the mdeals of
Vietnam and Watergate shows that
Americans have decided that
“democracy is worth preserving
..,ifit’s going to work the way wt
want it to, we’ll have to do it our

 

In addition, Hackes said that
Americans should counteract the
general trend tor politics to stress
charismatic personalities rather
than issues. He admitted that the
media (TV) has had its influence in
that trend. “Issues are boring, let’s
face it,” he said, “personalities are
interesting,"

For much of his talk, Hackes
presented his observations on the
upcoming presidential election to
the large crowd. including many
faculty and townspeople, in South
Lounge. He indicated that Carter
seems to be easily the Democratic
front runner, as he keeps gaining
momentum. Carter has Won the
most black votes to date and he ls
tar stronger than Ed Muskie tour
years ago, who was the front
runner at that time, But a large
number ol “uncommitted”
delegates (234 to Carter’s 283) and
a “stop Carter movement”
threaten to split the party. In the
event at a split at the convention,
the likely choices, he said, would
be “Ted” or “Hubert,” although he
thought it highly implausible that
the Party would nominate Hum-
phrey. “It could split the party
worse than in the McGovern
days." lie noted that the last time
the Democratic convention was In
New York, in 1924, it took 101
ballots before John W. Davis was
nominated.

Hackes noted that the possibility
ior “monumental mudslinging is
great, with Watergate as the main
focus,” but he said “blaming
Republicans for Watergate is guilt
by association, like Mc-
Carthyism.”

THREE LEVELS OF SHOPS

concern tor the department Atwell
enumerated three concerns of a
two person department which
weigh on her mind. With two
people, she said, lhe perspective of
the department is limited. The
workload will increase for Atwell
and Wellborn and they will not be
able to after special topics or
tutorials, she explained.

“It’s not an impossible
situation," Atwell remarked, “We
can live with it.” Wellborn echoed
her unhappy acceptance ol the cut

To alleviate the load, the
Education Department may
petition the Executive Council to
add at half-time position, Dean of
the College Waldo Walker said.
Atwell intends to make that
request this year. ’The half-time
person would teach elementary
and secondary math and science
methods, Atwell thinks.

The “American Educational
Thought” course will be dropped
from the curriculum next year, to
be replaced by “issues and Per-
spectives In Education.” Atwell
said.

The special education program
with Drake University, along with
other special topics such as
educating the mentally retarded or
alternative schools, will be
eliminated. The two tutorials
taught by education will have to be
taught by other departments,
Atwell Said. ,

Atwell and Wellborn will both be
carrying heavier teaching loads In
order to provide the basic courses
for teacher certification, Although
they will be teaching over 12 hours
per semester, they will receive no
extra compensation from the
college, Atwell said Wellborn
estimates his load will total about
18 hours, Atwell will have about 12
hours, but both will have several
student teachers to observe and
hold conferences with, which will
further increase their hours.

The help of the third hall-time
person will prevent the work irom
becoming overwhelming, Atwell
said, She noted, however, lhat it is
often hard to find a halfslimc
person who is committed to the
college and willing to spend time
with Students.
