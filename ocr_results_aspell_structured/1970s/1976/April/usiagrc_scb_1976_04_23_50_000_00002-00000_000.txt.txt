’The Hostage’

Performances of the theatre department’s final major
production of the year, Brendan Behan’s “The Hostage,”
which opened last night, continue tonight and tomorrow at 3
pm. and Sunday at 7 pm in Roberts Theatre.

Probably Behan's best known work, “The Hostage" takes
place in Dublin and focuses on a British soldier taken captive
by members of the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The IRA
hopes to use the soldier to gain the release of an lRA member
condemned to be hanged by the British Army.

Sandy Moiiet directs the play.

Filing in Hoth case

A special appearance has been iiled in the Sandra Hoth
case pending in Poweshiek County District Court, Dean of the
College Waldo Walker said. The special appearance contests
the court's jurisdiction in the case.

Sandra Both, assistant proiessor of physical education,
filed an appeal in court last month against the college with
President A. Richard Turner and Walker as respondents and
the lowa Civil Rights Commission. The appeal protests the
finding of me Iowa State Civil Rights Commission’s in
vestigation of Hoth’s denial of tenure and termination of
employment by the college and the college’s decision to do
both.

The special appearance says that die court has no
jurisdiction over Walker and Turner, who were not served
original notice in the case, Walker explained. It also says that
the court has no jurisdiction to consider the appeal of the civil

* rights commission ruling. Also, the appearance asks for the
cause to be dismissed, Walker said.

John Phillips, counsel for the college, is handling the case.

By—law changes approved

by Doug Schultz

At a well-attended meeting
. Wednesday night, SGA Joint Board
approved a proposal to amend or
adapt by-laws affecting several
administrative positions and a
proposal to redefine the role of hall
coordinator and establish a sup-
portive committee. Joint Board
also‘heard discussion and debate
about the Finance Committee’s
proposed budget ior 1976-77, but did
not vote on its adoption.

A proposal by Matt Cohen,
student coordinator, defines the
student coordinator as an om»
budsman-like executive with in-
vestigative powers, who may
appoint up to three salaried
assistants and nonsalaried
assistants as needed, all subject to
Joint Board approval. The
proposal also makes the social
coordinator a cabinet position, and
fuses the SGA treasurer and
ﬁnance Committee chairperson
into one cabinet post.

Finally, according to the
proposal, which establishes an
election board, the election board
chairperson shall serve as the SGA
secretary and administrative
assistant to the president and vice
president.
