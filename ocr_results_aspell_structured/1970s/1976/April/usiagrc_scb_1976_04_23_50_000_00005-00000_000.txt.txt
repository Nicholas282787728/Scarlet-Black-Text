Northfield, Minnesota is the hot-
bed of activity this month. Crime is
raging on the northern campuses,
On March so and April 2 a pizza
delivery man was mugged on
Carleton’s campus. The first at-
tacker netted 5180 and one pizza.
The other attacker was not as
lucky; he netted 8136 without a
pizza Students are suspect. No
arrests have yet been made. We
must confess it’s a new one on us.
Who has ever heard of a mugger
who absconds with a pizza? Saga
must be pretty poor in Carleton.

Secondly, some reporter on the
Carletonian stat! spent a good deal
oi energy investigating a rumor
that five St, Olaf women were
expelled from school ior operating
a prostitution ring. The St. Olai
Dean of Women wasn’t talking and
the Northfield police were com—
pletely mum on the issue. The
rumor was unsubstantiated. It
Should be remarked that such
things are not unknown. Reliable
sources reported that two Sweet
Briar coeds were arrested for

Charles Mingus will appear in
South Lounge this Saturday night
for two sets, at 9 and 10:30. He
will provide what probably is the
most attractive evening oi music
thus tar this year His expertise as
a writer, arranger, and bassist
date back to the 1940's, when he
entered the jazz scene with such
notables as Charlie Parker, Art
Tatum, and pianist Bud powell.

Born in 1922, Mingus moved irom
Arizona to the Watts district of
LA, From lessons on the trombone
(with which he became
frustrated), he moved on into Cello,
and iinally in high school began to
play the string bass. As a jazz
artist he represents music oi an
era of jazz which is the essential
jazz sound, and has remained an
innovator ior nearly forty years.
Mingus' bands, known as the JAZZ
WORKSHOP. have produced such
notables as Eric Dolphy, the
brilliant alto saxophonist and
flutist, Roland Kirk, Jakie
McLean. Jaki Byard and many
others, His Current Workshop
ieatures George Adams on tenor
sax, a wellestablished pianist

Women have to get through
college some way. We don’t make
much as waitresses and barmaids.
Besides, we don’t get athletic
scholarships.

colorado College women are up
in arms over the huge blunder
made by the school paper's editor
there. The editor published a photo
of two briefly»clad bathing
beauties in a March issue. The
photo was stolen from Sports
Illustrated. No credit was given to
the magazine The women were
especially incensed because the
caption beneath ore photo reierred
to the colorado College program in
the south of France. The editor was
fired, and women on campus made
public statements renouncing his
sexist statement.

Coe College had a knock ’em
dead conference on women held on
April 14. Speakers at the cons
ference, too numerous to list here,
included many prominent women
in the publishing field. Connie

named Don Pullen, Danny Richr
mond on drums, and Ronald
Hampton on trumpet.

According to Nat Hentoif, a
familiar .ime on jazz albums and
magazitn reviews, Mlngus’ music
is ”Thu llision oi lyricism. gen-
tleness, and force , . . ”

Mingus’ own musical philosophy
is reilectcd in his statement,
“What’s so iunny is some people
think a composer’s supposed to
please them. but in a way a
composer is a Chronicler like a
critic. He's supposed to report on
what he's seen and lived.”

Mingus' music is highly
esteemed throughout this country
and Europe, and his Workshop
ensembles have always been
considered among the best around
by jazz appreciators. He plays
clubs, concert halls, and even
small colleges, always striving ior
the utmost periection in sound. As
fortunate as we are to have him
appear at Grinnell, the success of
any such concert always depends
on the receptiveness of the
audience, Let's hear what he has to
say.

Chung of C.B.S. spoke on women in
the media and Washington politics.
The program was truly imr
pressive. Grinneil'with its token‘
programs in women's studies
looked pale in comparison, Maybe
iLs time to stop making fun oi Coe
College. The women there, despite
their make-up and high heels, are
much more politically advanced
than Grinnell women. -

That says a lot for our sister
schools.

Finally, word came irom Brown
University in Providence, Students
there are celebrating spring by
viewing the 60’s ﬂick “Where the
Boys Are." George Hamilton in his
starring role depicts a Brown
undergradwho picks up a young N.
Y.» U coed off the Beach in
Daytona. The students at Brown
still think this ﬂick is an all-time
ravorite. My source says it’s
because Brown men, stranded as
they are in Providence, can't pick
up any iemales, Voyeurism must
fill the gap. Hope you enjoy the
showing. guys. Get oii on it.

This is your big opportunity!
Hall representative and coor-
dinator elections are being held
this coming week. If you have
ideas about what you think SGA
should be doing ior students and
are willing to devote time to ac-
tualizing these, then you should run
[or hall representative or hall
coordinator.

Joint Board needs members who
are wi rig both to represent ei-
fectively their halls in SGA
decisions, and put time into
initiating and developing needed
proposals dealing with student
concerns. Every effort will be
made to make efficient use of
meeting time by advance
publication oi agendas and reports,
but this will only be effective if

representatives take time to read,

them in advance.

Likewise, if you have deflnite
feelings about what a hall coor-
dinator Should do to enhance the
atmosphere of the dorm, then
nominate yourself for the job. The

Coordinator's role should not be
limited to planning parties but
should extend to a more general
development of community living.
Ii student government is not the
area in which you can make your
most effective contribution to the
community, then make sure that
you elect someone who can.
Think about what roles you want
your hall representative and
coordinator to fulfill. Attend these

.meetings and question the can-

didates about what they intend to
do. What role do they want Joint
Board to take? what type of ac-
tivities should the hall coordinator
organize7 How do they plan on

representing you? Only by showing
your interest in these elections and
continuing it throughout next year
can you expect a student govern-
ment to exist for more than its own
sake.

The first step of the process of
electing hall representatives and
coordinators for 1976-77 will be this
Sunday at 6:30 pm. at meetings in
all hall lounges. At this meeting
hall members will discuss what
they expect from their officers and
nominations will be taken. 0n the
following Tuesday at 7 p in.
elections will be held after hall
members have had the opportunity
to question the candidates.
