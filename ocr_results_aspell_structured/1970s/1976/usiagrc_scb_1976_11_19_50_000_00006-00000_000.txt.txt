WHY IS
SIGLINDA STEINFULLER
DEAN OF BEER?

WHYNOT?

(And now the word from Siglinda)

  
 
  
   
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  

Fellow Beer Persons,

Life is full of unanswered ques—
tions such as: Is there intellie
gent life elsewhere in the
universe? And if so, do they
wear socks?

ln beer, however, there are
no unanswered questions.
Because there is only one
word for beer, and you know it.

Schlitz.

Therefore, as your Dean of
Beer, 1 suggest you research the
essential rightness of the word
for yourself at your next social
function. Or even your next anti-
social function.

And please note: The recom~
mended source material for
locating the word can be
found in any phone
booth. In other words,
look in the Yellow
Pages. Under “Beer.”

Thank you.

WHEN IT'S RIGHT,
YOU KNOW IT.
