Faculty approves Kissinger degree

by Bob Mitchell

in a meeting last Monday, the
Crime“ iaculty voted 27719 to
recommend to the College Board oi
Trustees that lienry Kissinger be
given a honorary degree should he
be the Rosenlield lecturer next
Semester

Kissinger is one oi wo present or
ioriner cabinet oiii s to whom
an invitation has been issued The
other is iormer Deiense Secretary
James Schlesinger

The faculty‘s vote iollowed a
recommendation ironi the laculty
council that Kissmger be given ati
honorary degree. This proposal

met With considerable opposition
irom some iaculty members, who
either felt that the College Should
not give honorary degrees to
lecturers as an inducement to
speak here. or that the College
should not give honorary degrees
zit all Another section of thC
iacuity objected to giving
Kissinger a degree because oi the
way he has conducted American
foreign policy.

Arguments in iavor ol reconl»
mending the presentation ol an
honorary degree were that
KissingCr has helped to bring about

Significant change in foreign policy
and history. and that the awarding
of honorary d ees Should not be
based on political considerations

Alter the vote was taken.
President. A Richard Turner said
that. given the closeness oi the
vote. he would not recommend lo
the Board Di Trustees that an
honorary degree be given, but he
said that the taculty had the optit§~
oi rejecting or sustaining ht.
inntion The iaculty reiected it
overwhelmingly, and now Turner
