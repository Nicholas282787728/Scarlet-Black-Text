Honors plan debated s

byJanet Pope

Proposals for an Honors
Program have been discussed by
the Curriculum Committee for the
last year and a half, Presently, the
committee is again discussing an
honors proposal. Two weeks ago, a
committee meeting ended before
much talk about honors took place.
Earlier this week, Donald Irving,
chairman of the committee, said
that the proposal would probably
be talked about at yesterday's
meeting.

Presently, the college sets
minimum grade point
requirements for honors and
allows each department to
determine its own standards for an
honors major. The proposal now
before the committee would
abolish the present program and
institute two requirements. it
would require “completion of an
‘honors major’ and successful
compleu'on oi some form of senior
project; a thesis, examination, or
other distinctive work."

Members of the Curriculum
Committee vary in their opinions
about the proposal. Mary
Eysenbach, dean of curriculum,
and several faculty members
expressed their support oi the
proposal. However, student
members generally are opposed to
it.

lrving supports the present
proposal. He terms the present
system “inequitable.” He said that
the proposal would “put some
rationale“ into an honors program.
He regards the honors program as
a “recognition of excellence" as
well as a step to give students more
options.

Presently, honors requirements
vary from department to depart-
ment. A 3.4 grade point average in
the major field and a 3.2
Cumulative grade point average

6th, aww .-

are the only college-wide
requirements. In many depart
ments, honors candidates are
recommended through informal
evaluation by department mem-
bers. ‘

Roberta Atwell, faculty member
of the committee, stated that she
thinks the proposal encourages
departments to think about what
honors means and let the students
know about the program.

Marc Geller and Mara Porper,
student members of the com-
mittee, do not see the need for any
type of honors program at Grinr
nell, According to Porper,- the
presentproposal is being instituted
in an attempt to alleviate the
problems in the advising system,
rather than on its own merits.
“Instead of attacking the advising
system they’re developing
honors," said Porper. According to
Geller, there are serious problems
with advising that cannot be
alleviated with an honors program.

Geller and Porper believe that
an honors program is a con-
tradiction to the philosophy oi
Grinnell. “Grinnell is sort of a nice
place,” explained Geller. “It lacks
stratification of students. This
proposal would create academic
stratification.”

However, .iim Freeman, also a
student member, said, “It's
ridiculous to be worried about
stratification. It’s going to happen,
It's just formalized with this
proposal.”

However, Freeman does believe
that an honors program goes
against Grinnell’s philosophy. “It
is saying that this student has
picked a better program than that
one," commented Freeman.

Eysenbach does not think the
stratiiication argument is an
important one, “We’re not setting
up separate courses. it's a step

that’s saying, with meat behind it,
what we think is a fine program
and leaving it up to the students to
pursue it or not,” she explained.

According to Mark Miller,
student member of the committee,
an honors program would not add
anything to the college’s general
academic offerings. Along with
Porper and Geller, Miller fears
that an honors program would
restrict ﬂexibility because the
decision to participate in an honors
program would have to be made by
the beginning oi the junior year.

Freeman called it a
psychological lock. “A student is
admitting defeat if he gets out,"
commented Freeman.

Geller and Porper tear that
honors is a step back towards
requiremenm. Porper expressed
the belief that faculty and ad
ministration are concerned at the
lack of a definition of a Grinnell
education. She sees this as an ef-
fort towards definition with
requirements to iollow.

Arnold Adelbcrg, faculty
member of the committee, com-
merited, “I think that the students
are reading into this proposal more
than exists. There is no evidence
thatlcan see that this isafirst step
towards requirements or

stratification. It's possible, but I _

don’t see it."

Adelberg stated that he would be
in favor of sending the proposal to
the faculty, even if there is some
opposition within the committee.
“It would be worthwhile if it
stimulated discussion,” Adelberg
said.

Irving explained that if the vote
on the proposal was tied or if it
passes with a substantial number
opposing it, it would be sent to the
faculty with a minority dissenting
report.
