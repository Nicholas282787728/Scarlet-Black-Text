Sheryl Huntoon's facial ex-
pressions ranged from tears to
exhaustion to sighs of relief, telling
the story oflastsaturday’s Miracle
Relays. Not just Huntoon’s, but the
racial expressions oi the whole
‘Vomen’s swim team were on a
'roller coaster as the meet see~
sawed back and forth, With
Kearney tNeb.7 Slate College
» ally edging out Grinnell by one
point for the title. or did they?
it seems that Kearney broke a
rule, by entering a swimmer in
ur events when the rules allow
[or a swimmer to be entered at
most three times. AS this article is
being set to print, the official
winner of the meet hasn't been
decided. if Kearney’s 400 yard
freestyle relay is disqualiﬁed then
Grinnell wins and will have suc»
cessfully defended its title.
Controversies aside, the com-
bination of over 100 swimmers and
a packed balcony made for one oi
he most emotion—charged meets
ever to take place at the PEC. All
of the relays were close, with first
place often being decided by less
ﬁan a second, in the end, the
rinnell partisans left with
memories of some very tired

swimmers who had turned in
excellent periormances.

Following the first relay, the 400
yard medley relay, in which
Grinnell took second, was the 850
free relay. After Renee Reichart's
so yard leg, Cathy Hankes’ loo
yard leg, and Mary Forsylh's Zoo
yards, the event still wasn’t Sets
tled Huntoon raced Cheryl Bates
of Central Missouri State in a 500
yard leg that left Grinnell fans
hoarse irom cheering and lluntoon
completely out of breath, Bates
touched first to give CMS a win by
.8 of a second.

With the lead changing hands
throughout the meet, Grinnell
placed second in the 100 iree relay.
third in the 300 individual medley
relay, third in the diving and third
in the 300 butterﬂy event.

Still. Grinnell Stayed at the top
without having won a single event.
In the 300 backstroke event the
lead changed hands several times,
Reichart and Cindy Smith
swimming the first two legs for
Grinnell. When Margo Wessner
entered the water she was down
five or ten yards to Central
Missouri State. stroking with a
steady smoothness, Wessner

destroyed the opposition to give
Grinnell a victory by 4.8 seconds.
Her Split time of 1:0 8 for 100
yards was under the time set for
qualiiying ior the women‘s
nationals. Should she do the same
in a 100 yard race she could
become Grinnell‘s first qualifier to
the women’s nationals,

Crinnell was disqualified for a
false start on the second leg of the
300 yard breast stroke relay sen-
ding the meals outcome to the
iinal race, the 400 yard free relay.
Again the race was close, with
Huntoon providing a thrilling finish
despite being edged out.
Augustana touched out Grinnell
4:15 0 to 415.5 to win the event and
give Kearney the title.

Overshadowed by the Miracle
Relays was a 81741 thrashing that
Grinnell handed Luther in home
action the evening beiore, Cathy
Hankes, who was told two years
ago that she would never be fast
enough tor the team, provided the
highlight of the evening, winning
the 500 yard ircestyle.

sHoth critical of tenure, priorities

by Dave Schcchtcr

Charging that Grinnell College
demonstrated “a lack of inv
stitutional integrity," Sandy mom
has expressed displeasure with the
reasons given for the decision not
to grant her tenure, In her
dissatisfaction noth has pointed up
several problems‘in the tenure
structure.

3» Hoth, an alumnus of Grinnell, is
#n assistant professor and has
aught and coached here since
1967. in addition, she was chair-
woman of the Physical Education
‘Department this year until she
“signed.

The Board of Trustees denied
l-ioth tenure last spring, upon the
recommendation of the Executive
Council. When a professor is not
granted tenure, his contract exv
pires one year after the decision
not to tenure.

Hoth was not granted a hearing
heiore the council and her appeal
went to a Committee containing
members of the Executive Council.
she noted, “For them to reverse

2 decision would have been to
admit that they were wrong in the
first place." College President A.

jicnard Turner explained that no
enure nominee receives a hearing

(and that Hoth agreed to the appeal
process described above.

The Iowa State Civil Rights
Commission reviewed Hoth's

tomplaint in which she charged
that her contract was terminated
because of her sex, and decided not
to take further action.

“1 was told that i wasn’t capable
of keeping up with the pace oi
expansion in women's athletics . . .
My mind was spinning. To be done

iby a program I started on this
ampus,” remarked Hoth. She

admits to being a better teacher
than coach. adding that, “There
are very few women in this country
who have not learned their
coaching within the last two or
three years, I was not hired as a
coach."

She claims to have been told by
Dean Waldo Walker that her “lowe

key approach was not a good
coaching philosophy." Hoth
pointed to Ray Obermiller's cross
country and swimming teams as
examples of a successful low-key
approach. She also claims to have
been told that the college felt that it
could find a “better person."
Turner would offer no comment on
this.

Of the four tenured members of
the Physical Education Depart—
ment, two males recommended
tenure, one male made no coins
merit, and one female recom-
mended further investigation. This
was included in the report of the
Civil Pu'ghts Commission. Turner
stated that in any tenure con
sideration you do not proceed it

doubts exist, and for him, that two
tenured department members did
not recommend tenure demon-
strates doubt. “We usually leave it
to the faculty to determine what
faculty come and go,” noted
Turner.

Forty random student
evaluations of Hoth produced
generally favorable reactions, yet
the Executive Council seems to
have placed inordinate weight on
one negative response out of eight
given by the field hockey team,
coached by Hoth. Turner com-
mented that no conclusions should
be drawn without knowing lhe
contents of every evaluation.

Hoth charges that the college
does not support physical
education programs. ”I don’t think
that there's much interest in or
respect for this department. They
don’t think that this should be a
tenured department," commented
Hath.

She also believes that the
college’s commitment to women’s
athletics is couched in expediency.
“It Will continue as long as its
convenient and it can be done
without strain . . . The women’s
program is relatively cheap to run.
if we find ourselves without
competition close by, as I believe
we will in the next few years, it will
get more expensive." she said. The
women’s budget for this year is
around $8,000, the men's close to
$40,000. Both did state that the
women have received every dollar
requested.

Hoth differs with athletic
director John Pfitsch‘s
“philosophy of using part time,
nonaprofessional people” to coach,
such as other faculty and resident
advisers. Hoth also believes that

the college has oiiered more sports
than it can adequately handle. "My
approach is to do What you're going
to do well, and not have programs
if they can't be well handled.”

l-loth expressed a lack oi ops-

timism regarding the luiure of
women's athletics at Grinnell.
“The college is not making any
effort to improve the program.
They‘re paying lip service to it,"
stated Hoth.

in light of expansion in women's
athletics Hoth stated that she could
not understand the cut of Donna
Mack's part time position in the
physical education department. As
a result the college is seeking
someone to teach folk dance which
Meck now handles. About staff cuts
Turner Said, “Almost without
exception they involve part time
positions. We would rather do this
than make a cut of whole programs

. This is not the application oi a
mechanical plan to cut any
department.”

Hoth contends that she resigned
as department chairman because
of the way she Says that Walker
would routinely go to Pfitsch on
matters concerning physical
education. She further stated that
she was never informed of Meck‘s
Cut. Therefore, rather than be
circumvented by the ad-
ministration, she resigned as
chairwoman.

Sandy I-Ioth has a bitter taste
remaining in her mouth as a result
of the decision. “I have to feel that
I've been screwed to the Wall. l've
been shoved under the rug,”
declared Hoth. The handling of her
case has left Hoth with concern for
the integrity oi a liberal arts
college like Grinnell.
