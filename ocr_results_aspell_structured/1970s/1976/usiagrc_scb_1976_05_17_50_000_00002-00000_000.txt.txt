A sen/0r editor's View:
Where are we
headed A.R.T.?

Departing tomorrow with bachelor degrees in hand, we
stand with a liberal arts education giving strength to our feet
and knees which support our persons. Leaving, we believe
Grinnell has been a strengthening inﬂuence in our lives, but
we wonder will it be the same for those behind us?

As alumni now, we still have a great concern and part in
Grinnell College. But what we wonder now is, where is
Grinnell headed under President A. Richard Turner?

Perhaps the presidency is all image and personality. If so,
we’re healthy and growing. Our president seems to thrive
and succeed at alumni parties across the country. The ideas
he has initiated so far have been “great,” to use an over-
worked adjective. After all, he's given us skip day (so he can
drink beer and ride in a balloon?) and awards for Iowa
teachers at graduation (which is well and good for public
relations but not exactly powerful and momentous ad-
ministration).

Turner is quite involved with Development and the up—
coming carnpaign. Fine, but he is perhaps too involved.
James Avison, vice president for institutional development,
has recently resigned, saying it was time to move on. But
maybe, he felt crowded and pushed out by Turner's in-
volvement.

If some substantial, solid administration has evolved from
Turner‘s office, perhaps we miss it for the rhetorical, circular,
meaningless “ruminations" and explanations which he quite
entertainingly employs to melodically talk his way around
everything, never saying anything.

Listen to him “ruminate” on tenure, the issue he's stirred
up and now is avoiding, using, and abusingiperhaps to be
amusing? First, he claims it is a faculty issue and decision,
then he claims it is an administrative one, and then he leaves
it hanging.

Now we know who actually makes this place function—
Dean Waldo Walker. And thank god for that. Without
Walker, there would be no budget, no one to tell faculty they
aren't rehired because there is “too much" tenure; no one to
talk to students about college problems, and attempt to
solve them. Sure you can always get into see Turner and talk
at him, He will talk back around you, but invariably he will
return to contemplating questions about the future of the
college. Fine, except the future will 'not be created out of such
eternal pondering. .

Moving down the administrative ladder, we face Dean of
the Curriculum, Mary Eysenbach. As a militant watchdog of
Student Handbook curriculum “rules,” the dean is superb.
But, We entered Grinnell wanting a ﬂexible, open, innovative
curricular approach. That kind of approach is appropriate to
the “liberalrless” of Grinnell. The idea now appears to be ”fit
the student to the curriculum” instead of the curriculum to
the student. This office and clean must be responsive to
students, because students and curriculum is what Grinnell
is all about.

Fortunately, we have faculty whose main concern is
teachin Many of them have remarked how remarkably free
ofpoli king the faculty seems to be. Between the faculty and
the students, the dedication and desire for liberal arts at
Grinnell is evident. When or will we be able to say as much
for the “third branch?"

Grinnell has given us our education, our start in life. It has
been like having a bowl of Wheaties for breakfast every
morning which makes us big and strong. As we turn over our
Wheaties to classes behind us. will the college administration
have made them soggy? We most sincerely and nostalgically
hope not.

As alumni, we can give to Grinnell as it has given to us. As
students our input was often suppressed or minimal, but as
alums, it will be actively sought. In giving our loyalty,
dedication, and dollars to Grinnell, we should demand wise
and honest administrative care of our alma mater.
