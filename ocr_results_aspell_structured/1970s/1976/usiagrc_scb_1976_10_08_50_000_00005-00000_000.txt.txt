“Have i ever wanted to leave?
Not really. no, Sometimes things
get tough but you know. you on-
counter tough things wherever you
are ”

The family concept is very
strong in religious communities.
Everything is shared, and
everyone is equal, “I feel like this
is my family You get to know the
people you live with and we feel
really close. Two of the sisters here

world forever. Our order is an
“active” one. more or less out in
the world, teaching and nursing,"

The subject of the new nursing
home is a topic close to her heart,
Started in July oi this year the
hospital administration expects to
move in by January of 1977. The old
St. Francis Manor will no longer be
a nursingcare facility, and the
nuns do ,not know if they will
be allowed to continue living there.
“We don‘t know what they’re going
to do with this building. The state

{ire inspector condemned it, But I

Europe to see 700 year old
buildings? If those over there stand
so many years ours can too, We are
a wasteful nation. , . In ten years
that new building will be obsolete
and they’ll have to build another
one,”

Sister Stanislaus expressed
ambivalent feelings about the
changes brought about since
Vatican II. (This was a Vatican
Council. held In the midrlgoo’s
under Pope John that decreed that
all religious orders should revise
and update their roles within the
total structure of the Church.)
“Pope John opened the window but
I don’t think he wanted to go this
far. I think the changes have

original idea, It's a good thing that

the words of the Office now. But

things. We used to takea new name

now you can it you want to. we
used to wear our wedding band on
the right ring finger, but Paul
changed it to the left hand like any
other married woman."

Many of the most evident
changes occured in the traditional
habits worn by nuns. Most orders
now wear “modified" dresses,

 

shorter in length, less severe and
less Medieval than the old habits
twhich otteii weighed up to twcnty
poundsi. “But many sisters are
choosing to go back to the
traditional, conservative orders I

most of the zoo sisters in my
mother house don't keep the veil
anymore either Ilike the veil. I'm
used to it,”

When asked about the recent
Controversy revolving around
ordaining women bishops in thc
Episcopalian church and the
related issue of women as priests,
Sister Stanislaus asserted 2i firm
position, “I don't approve of it. If
Christ had wanted women to be
priests or bishops He would have
ordained a woman as one of the
twelve disciples A woman has a
role to fill just as a man has a role
to fill. and I don’t think a woman
could be a priest ”

As to the future or her own order.
the Franciscans, Sister Stanislaus
does not see good prospects: “I
tear for the future of our order I
know I'll be taken care of, I can go
to [he Mother House and they'll
take care of me. But we only had
two novitiates this year. My class
had iourteen, the year before had
seventeen. the problem is too much
permissiveness. now young girls
can go anywhere. and do
everything. The only way I could
have gotten the education and
opportunities I have had is through
the Church I’ve had two careers,
nursing and teaching. I feel very
lucky . . . fulfilled ”

I have this friend I call on to
make sense, when Ican only make
spaghetti out of the most abstruse
of economic graphs. His com-

ﬁeoretical mathematics cun~
tinually astounds me, cone
sequently, he has my greatest
admiration and respect.

We got to talking the other day
about the changing weather pat-
terns and the number of natural
disasters that seems to have lately
multiplied to a dangerous
magnitude. “Are things really
getting worse,” I inquired. “Or
does it just appear that way

‘ecause ofour improved system oi
global communication?"

After a moment's reflection, and

‘en with hesitation. he replied

quietly, “They say we’re going into
another ice age."

“You mean they’ve settled the
question?" Iasked, eager to know.
“Wasn’t it just two years ago that
they were carrying on a great
debate about whether we'd all
freeze, or try, to deathi"

Having finished just before this a
discussion of some manemade
disaster, like the probability of
World War III, I was In a suitable
frame of mind to think about the
end of the world anyway, so I
pressed my friend on ior details.
“Won’t it take a long time?" I
asked.

”Not necessarily. There’s this
theory that the earth could change

has to explain the mastodons,”

Yes, I had heard these things,
And then considering our own

Leach

makes

non-campaign stop

.rini Leach. congressional candidate from thc First District, in a
noncompaign stop on campus last week.

The grandson of former Grinnell
College Trustee J. A, Smith (the
donor of Smith Hall), was on
campus last Friday. He was here
not to inspect his relatives legacy,
but to discuss with two political
science classes the role of a
congressional candidate. He,
James A. Smith Leach, is
challenging incumbent Ed Mez-
vinsky for the opportunity to
represent Grinnell College and the
rest of the First District of Iowa in
Congress

Leach‘s appearance was a non
campaign stop, but he seemed to
impress the group with his "is
telligence and his candor.
Professor Stone said he was “very
impressed with Leach’s ability to
articulate the complexities of his
campaign . . . he is unusually
reflective and realistic about his
campaign, His views of how the
electorate views him were very
useful.”

Professor Gilmour said bluntly,
“Leach is a damn good candidate ,

. the kind both parties should
offer "

Two of Grinnell College's most
active Democratic students, both
committed lilezvinsky supporters,
had words of praise for Leach, Jlm
Jensen said, ”The First District is
lucky to have two such good
candidates running. No matter
who wins, the district will be well-
represented." Jon Nciderbach

said, “If I had to vote for a
Republican, I‘d vote for Jim
Leach. He is very intelligent."

The entire session was a
questionranswer period about
diiferent aspects oi the campaign.
Leach said that most voters. while
they do not call themselves
Republicans, are close to
President Ford on the issues
Although he is aware that most of
the‘electorate does not care about
the issues, Leach said he believes
that he ought to run an issue
oriented campaign As a
challenger, he must give the voters
a reason to vote for him rather
than the incumbent. It is his hope
that his image with the voters will
develop around the issues
dismissed.

Because of the geography of this
district, Leach said, TV ad
vertising would not be very el‘r
fectlve for the cost involved.
Therefore, he plans to use more
radio and some newspaper ad»
vertising,

Leach acknowledged the dif-
ficulty in deieating a twoterm
incumbent, But. he hopes he can
attract the support of several ins
dependents and Democrats who
may vote for Carter for President.
