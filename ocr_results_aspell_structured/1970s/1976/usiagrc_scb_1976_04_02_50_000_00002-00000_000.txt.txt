Concert series lauded

Grinnell’s pioneering in bringing top jazz as well as rock,
folk and blues perlormers to the campus was lauded In a
March 27. 1976, article in the nationally famous musicians'
magazine, Billboard. Writer Jim Fishel called it “one of the
best-balanced concert series of the past decade,” in spite of
the relatively small concerts budget with which Georgia
Dentel, Grinnell's activities counselor, must deal.

Fishel stressed the great diversity of artistic talent which
has appeared at the college, giving a synopsis of the top acts,
and pointing out that Grinnell picked up on many of the top
performers before they achieved national or international
renown.

Finance surveys

The SGA Finance Committee has distributed question-
naires concerning the SGA budget to a random selection of
over one-mird of the student body in order to survey students’
priorities concerning SGA expenditures for next year.

The survey breaks down the budget into 11 categories
(yearbook, newspaper, radio, major concerts, movies, small
concerts, ini 'ative fund, hall funds, general and other social
costs, administrative costs, and public events). It asks
students to consider the quality of services rendered and the
relative importance and costs of each item.

The committee hopes for a high rate of return and asks
students who received copies oi the survey to return them to
the SGA mailbox by Monday.

Sociology meeting

Next Thursday evening at B p.m., ilse Leitillger will meet
with sociology majors and other students interested in
sociology. Meeting in Younkel-s Lounge, Leitinger will
discuss the new curriculum and other topics of interest in
sociology. . .

by AbhiSwanson

Christopher Hunter. who is
presently pursuing a PhD. in
Sociology at Princeton University,
has been hired to fill the second of
two positions in the department of
Sociology at Grinnell tor the 197647
academic year. A third position in
that department will be filled
during the course of next year,
according to Dean Waldo Walker.

Hunter and Ilse Leitinger, a
candidatehired earlier this winter,
were on the campus during spring
recess for two days, engaged in
designing the sociology curriculum
for next year.

The most radical curricular
changes that have been proposed
concern the structure of the
sociology major per se. Currently,
an introductory course in sociology
and a minimum of 32 credits are
the sole requirements for the
major. Certain courses, such as

The Scarlet and Black, April 2, 1916—1). 2

Propose sociology changes

“Sociological Theory,” are
strongly recommended, In
response to student opinion within
the department, proposed changes
in the major for next year include
requiring of three more courses, in
addition to the introductory course.
Tentatively, these would be
courses on “Methods of Empirical
Investigation," “Sociological
Theory," and a seminarfwhich
would serve as a capstone of the
major and encompass recent
research in several sub-fields of
the discipline.

Other proposed revisions include
the elimination of three special
topics courses presently being
offered, as well as courses entitled
“The Community” and “The
Sociology of Law." The content of
these five courses would con-
ceivably be included within the
framework of alternative offerings
in the department, such as

”Political
“Deviance"
Disorganization."

The rationale for these and other
changes proposed by Hunter and'
Leitinger is based on the premise
that all sociology majors need an
exposure to basic sociological
theory and methods of research, in
order for them to more fully
comprehend the multifaceted
discipline. The tentative
requirements would not be
retroactive for present declared
sociology majors. Both Hunter and
Leitinger realize there may be
some problems during the tran-
sition period next year for majors @
who may desire to take new Course
offerings, but who do not have the
prerequisites ior them, and
therefore “permission of the i
structor" will be liberally in-
terpreted.

Housing decisions reached

by Elaine Ashbaugl’l

Last Monday afternoon, the
Housing Committee finalized
decisions concerning dorm
designations for next year's Quiet
Hall, Writers’ Hall, and Intentional
Democratic Community.

A new idea in community living
on the Grinnell campus is the Ins
tentional Democratic Community
(IDC). The three upper ﬂoors oi
Dibble Hall have been assigned for
use by this group. The lDC plan-
ners, particularly Blake Downs
and Ginny Rose, have drawn up a
four-page social contract setting
forth goals of the community,
rights of individual community
members, general organization of
the group, etc. Each Grinnellian
wishing to join the IDC must sign
this contract, which speciiically

School bonds defeated

by Tom Rowat

Voters in the Grinnell-Newburg
School District rejected both of the
school bond issues presented
March 23. Both proposals failed to
reach me 60 per cent required for
passage in the referendum. The
proposal to spend $3.5 million to
build a new junior high school
gained 56.9 per cent of the vote,
while the proposal to spend $400,000
to remodel the old junior high
received only 50.6 per cent.

The story was a familiar one as
the town of Grinnell approved the

stresses community sharing of
interests and tolerance and u“.
derstanding of each others in»
dividual rights.

At present. 23 students have
decided to participate. Of the
group consisting of 1 upcoming
senior, 12 upcoming juniors, and la
upcoming sophomores, 9 are
female and 15 are male.

Although the Writers’ Com-
munity originally looked as if it
would fill an entire hall, the
community now consists of four
students~Ed Peaco, Mark Maire,
Clay Jenkins, and Chris Anderson.
They will occupy 4 singles in
Dibble Pit. They plan to share
ideas and support each other in
their writing endeavors.

The Housing Committee
designated Smith‘ Hall ‘as Quiet

bond issue for the new junior high,
but the outlying areas of the school
district defeated the proposal. The
school officials are encouraged but
not happy With the results of the
referendum. School Superin-
tendent Mike Slusher» stated in a
Grinnell Herald-Register article,
“It seems that are community has
accepted the board’s position that
the old junior high is not worth
repairing and that new facilities
are now being seriously con-
sidered. I think that 57 per cent is

Hall. This year, the quiet com-
munity’s first year, the committee
had also Chosen Smith as Quiet
Hall. '
Although a significant, but
relatively small, number of
Grinnellians actually plan to
participate in one of the specific
dorm communities, students ap.‘
pear to defend strongly their right ’
to have such living arrangements,
if they wish. All 465 students who
answered the question or whether
or not the socially-directed student“
community option should be ’
available, (asked on a housing
questionaire handed out to
students last fall), replied ”yes."
Susan Green Crim, assistant dean
of Student Affairs, emphasizes that
any group can appeal to the
Housing Comm tee for hall space.

encouraging," ‘

State law requires that six
months pass before another bond
issue is put before the voters.
President of [he Grinnell-Newburg‘
Board of Education. Kenneth
Keenan, is in favor of trying at that
time to get another bond issue
passed by the voters. Even ifa new
junior high is approved at that
time, the students in the junior and
senior high schools have at least
two more years to look forward to
split shifting.
