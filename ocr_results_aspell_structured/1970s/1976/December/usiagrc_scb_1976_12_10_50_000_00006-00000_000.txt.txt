Both Goodenun and Buck concur
that part at the problem lies witii
course oflerings. which they
suggest could be madc to retiect
more topical interests, tlitis
drawing more women and
minority protcssors But, says
Buck. this may not be effective. "I
was amazed to find only one
woman in the English Department
at Gi'inliell. oven tiiougli there are
so many women l‘inishing graduate
school in English" Retention is

also seen as a problem by buck, .

"No single man or woman. and ten
minorities, would “ant to Stay in

should try to hire at the mid-levels,
while getting the most excellent
short-term people available . . 1
think the primary problem of
retention centers around the
community as a small-town, rather
than with any fault of the College."

Goodenow sees the formation of
the job description as the critical
point for any real affirmative
action in hiring, He maintains that
these descriptions can and Should
be written in such a way as to make
the job more attractive to women
and minority candidates as well as
assigning duties that more women
and minority candidates are
qualified for. Unfortunately at this
point, and in light of the way the
new administrative positions were
defined. Goodenow asserts that
”the College just seems to have no
sensitivity to this " The new Vice
Provost postion, he indicated. is an
example oi a job description uhich
almost immediately precludes any
women or minority candidates.

To help remedy this situation
Coodenow suggests a meeting be
set up, perhaps in the spring, to
address these and other rclatcd
questions and to convene a group or
peoplc to come up with some

 

creative solutions. Buck urge
more organized student pressure
and secs this role as a crucial one,
"Students need to demand (on,
sistently and concretely that the
composition of thc iacuity and
administration more closely
resemble the composition of the
student body and Society.”

The problems ot aihrmative
action at the College were made
painfully clear to some members
of the faculty by the recent ode

Roberta Atwell, Associate

the belief that “the hiring

(We) wish you tranquil nights of pleasant dreams.
(We) wish you velvet moonlight from above

And ioys of home beside the firelight’s gleam.

And friendship’s hand along life’s winding way.

And all the very best of Christmas days.

Next on the affirmative action

Citing retention as a major hurdle.
Eysenbacli offered the View that
“the only possibility for increasing
the number of women and
minorities on the faculty is through
higher level appointments."

Atwell was ”brought in over the
top" at the associate professor
rank in 1973, but as she points out,
this method oi placing women or
minorities in higher positions is
generally cost prohibitive Instead
Atwell proposes faster promotion
to remedy the retention problem.

affirmative action problem as

“The tact is th v (women and
