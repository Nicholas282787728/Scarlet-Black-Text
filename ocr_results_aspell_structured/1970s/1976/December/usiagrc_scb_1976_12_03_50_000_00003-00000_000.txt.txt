by Catherine James

n recent weeks the
n a m e s G o R P
(Grinliell Outdoor
Recreation program
and Kathy lucCluskey

have been tossed around quite a,

hit. Evidence suggests, however,
that Iew people in Grinneii truly
know what GORP is or how it
operates, Ostensibly GORP is an
”outing club ” its real purpose is to
provide any interested student
with an escape irom campus and a
chance to do something in the great
outdoors more challenging than
tossing a frisbec. A ievv hours away
from Grinnell can do Wonders for
one‘s "personal development.”
GORP can provide students with
gear tor private recreational use.
Backpacks, sleeping bags, etc. can
be checked out by any student
More technical gear, such as
saving and climbing equipment,
ca be used only by those whose
qu‘ 'tieations are known. in ad-
(Illion to private trips, GORP is the
organizational sponsor lor most of
the all-campus recreational
outings As a general rule, these
excursions are administered on a
"first come. first serve" basis,
People on a GORPsponsored trip
can check out whatever gear they
need far that particular trip.
GORP House was created to
consolidate the organizational
core Both of the coordinators and
'he treasurer live there, making it
easier tor McCluskey or any other
interested person to get in touch
with them, The house was not
intended to make GORP into an
elitist clilb Within reason. anyone

The coordinators are available to
assist in the planning andor
execution of these activities.
Despite the rehiriiig ot Mce
Cluskey, the outlook for the
coordinating of next year's GORP
activities is still a bit bleak. Mc-

Up until this time, as stressed
during tiie connict regarding the

provided much assistance in both
ttie planning and the execution or
many GORP activities in light of
her new job description she is
presently trying to ”wean"
students irom her leadership
although an apparent lack ot
student participation is making the
transition more difficult For this
reason, GORP members em-
phastzed support tor the
organization is now more time
perative than ever. Unless more
people help plan and execute ac-
tivities, GORP will graduate all DI

Concerning this year's activities,
events are planned a month ahead

held the first Thursday of every
month. A variety ol student opinion
is vital to insure a variety oi acV

small number of students attend
these meetings, and GORP par-
