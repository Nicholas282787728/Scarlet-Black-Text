Committee Meetings Closed

by Don Dagenais

Students and non-member iaculty
personnel will not be allowed to
attend iaculty committee meetings
unless speciiicaily invited, the fac—
ulty decided last Monday in app-
roving a proposal oi the Faculty
Organization Committee Themove,
taken alter considerable debate and
after several substitute motionsand
amendments had been defeated,
changes a policy which has been in
effect ever since the second laculs
ty meeting of the 1970-71 school
year.

Five of the affected committees
have regular student members and

Trustees Raise Fees, Reiect
Pllti And ISPIRG Proposals

by Don Dagenais

Members oi the college’s board or Trustees, meeting on campus last
weekend, approved a $200 increase in the comprehensive teeter next
year, reinsed to approve the establishment or a pub on campus and re-
jected a plan tor the iunding oi the iowa student interest Research Group

for the second semester

In other action, the Board added another member and also designated
the President of the Board of Dreams of the Alumni Association as an

ex oificio member of the Board.

$195 at the new ice increase will
be added to the tuition charge, $3
will constitute an increase in the

Student Activities Fee, and $2 will
be added to the Forum Fee, which
pays ior equipment and Forum supr
plies. The increase in the Activ-
ities Fee had been recommended by
the Joint Board of SGA

In a letter mailed to parents yes-
terday, President Leggett explained
the tuition increase as “made manor
datory by an over-all proiected rise
oi approximately iive per cent in
the operating budget of 1973474 over
that of 1972473.” The rise, he said,
was “in line with that sustained in
previous years” and was made necs
essary primarily because of inilan
tion,

The college, Leggett noted, will
“take action to increase its finan-
cial-aid resources and will consid~
er the tee increase as a delinite
iactor when determining the iinane
cial assistance required by iamiiies
of our students ’

The total comprehensive charge tor
students will total $4,050 for the
1973774 year

Like the Idea, But...
in a resolution passed Saturday

Trustees and representatives irom

concerning the pub issue, the Board
said that it “approves the concept oi
the establishment of a Pub on cams
pus, hut withholds approval of an
actual establishment until it has,
through its Executive Committee,
been given a iuller statement oinced
and or legal, iinancial, and opera
lional iactors which give more as
surance than presently oi its sucs
cessflil and efficient operation.”
The resolution, in eiiect, places the
matter back in the hands of the
Student Government Association,
which must provide more detailed
information to the Trustees con,
cerning the matters speciiied
ISPiRG Funding
On the matter of ISPIRG funding,
the Trustees received a resolution
which had been passed by the Joint
Board advocating a tuition Charge
“checkroii” funding plan, in which
students would be assessed $1.50
:1 semester on the tuition bill as
the contribution toward state and lo-
cal ISPRIG groups. Students not
wishing to contribute to the organ-
ization could, under the proposal,
have been able to obtain refunds by

Post Election Mood:Con¢ern

PPPE’S election night party pros

degree or satisiaciion, very much
like the election itself, An early
Clear indication of the Nixon lands
slide led the predominantly McGovn
ern-supporting students to concen-
trate more on state races, partic-
ularly those in Iowa.

With many students returning irom
a long day of political activity, some
beginning as early as 5 am,
the otter of free food and hot coffee
seemed the initial attraction of the
South Lounge party The crowdgens
erally numbered about 100, some
planted firmly in front of one of the
three televisions and the rest wans
dei-ing irom one to another, inhopes
of seeing the results of Iowa or
home state elections.

Any sense oi tenseness or even
much disillusionment was strangely
lacking irom the group, perhaps be
cause the final result of the nation»
31 election was known so early, The
victories oi highiyiavored local cans
didates were the topic of Constant
discusSion, resulting from the Care-
iiil attention paid the campus vote
by these candidates. The commenta-
tors' opinions were observed and
challenged, particularly because oi
the contrast between network inter»
pi-etaiions. Events oi the day at
various headquarters and polls'
throughout the state were compared,
the prevalent emotion being a sense
of satisfaction at the work accoms
plisiied.

Occasional hnrsts oi applause rose

irom one television or another, as
the final results of important elec-
tions became known, and the abid—
ing impression at the end of elecs
tron day remained one oi somewhat
saddened satisiactlon,

Election results remainedthemain
topic Diconversation throughout the
next day and the rest of the Week,
with various interpretations of the
meaning of the overabundance of
split tickets put iorih. The iuture
oi politics in America and partic-
ularly, oi the Democratic party,
were debated over breakfast, lunch,
and dinner, Very little bitterness
was expressed about the results
of the national election, although
people were serious and almost
somber on listening to George MC-
Govern’s concession speech the ac-
ceptance speeches anresidentNix—
on.

The results or local elections ale
most appeared to repudiate a sense
of loss in the national election.
This reeling was brought out by a
McGovern worker at the state head-
quarters in Des Moines, who noted
that now people would simply have
to explore other avenues oichange
such as ISPIRG and CommonCause.
Those looking ior ways oi chnngs
ing the society would have to start
on the locallevel, rather than cons
centrating solely on nationalissues.
This sort oi commitment appearsto
be almost the exact opposite of the
dissillnsionment teit after the I968
conventions and campaign. Grinnell
students, it seems, were looking
toward the future
