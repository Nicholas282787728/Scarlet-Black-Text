Vote March 23

Vote yes on the $3.5 million school bond issue to build a
new junior high school in Grinnell. Vote no to the other issue
to repair the old junior high for $400,000. Above all, vote
March 23.

The Grinnell community goes to the polls March 23 to
consider the fate of education in town. The issues are critical
to education received by all Grinnelliansitown and college.
(For information about the issues and the school situation
see page 1 story.) .

The closure of the junior high this year and split-shifting
have had a negative quality effect on the education of the
town’s high school students. The town’s poor educational
system may begin to seriously take a toll on our college
education unless positive reform is initiated through a bond
issue.

Charles Seller's departure from the college for the sake of
his children’s education could be just the beginning of a
number of exits caused by the declining quality of education
available below the college level. Many faculty and ad-
ministration members are deeply concerned and troubled
about their children’s education. This problem could force
some of our quality educators to abandon us in order to
provide their children with quality education.

True, we as college students don't pay property taxes,
which pay for such issues, but we do provide a healthy chunk
of the town's economy. A study in 1971-72 showed that
college-related business amounted to almost $6 million,
which was then about nine per cent of the total business
volume for the town. We indirectly help pay financially and
now we have an opportunity to prevent paying
educationally.

We believe that the $3.5 million issue should be the only
one passed because it provides a permanent, sound solution

"to the problem. The $400,000 issue for repairs would be only
a temporary measure, delaying the inevitability of the need '
for a new building. Unfortunately, if we vote for both issues,
the likelihood that only the $400,000 issue will pass is great.
The town never before has been receptive to building an
entirely new building and still may opt for the cheap way out
this time. If we vote for the $400,000, also, our votes added
to town votes will allow town-dwellers to duck the need. A
vote for the $3. 5 issue is a definitive commitment to im-
proved education, not a stopgap tactic.

in order to vote, students must register by March 13.
Registration may be completed, by anyone 18 years old by
the election date, at the School Board Offices (above Grinnell
Office Supplyi or at the Grinnell City Offices, 819 Broad
Street from 8 am. to 12 pm. and l p.m. to 5 pm. weekdays.

Since the election is during spring break, students must
request absentee ballots from the School Board Office or pick
up an official request form in the Forum. Official forms are
not necessary; students may submit a signed handwritten
personal request.

lack of drugs on this tour. The only
thing I've seen is the white
powdered insulin Dylan has to melt
and inject every couple of hours for
his diabetes. Sometimes he has to
inhale the powder so it will get to
the diabetes faster. I never knew

tonight before the Show. He ate two
harmonicas for dinner—without

“Allen,“ as everyone calls him, as
that is his name) sensed this. He

“You are not the old Springsteen,
you are not the old Springsteen."

what the encore will be tonight.

sound generous until we compare it
with the allowance for Amherst

to a Sad conclusion. How much is
the tuition at Amherst anyway?

On the lighter side we’ve heard
that suicide is the big issue at
Marminn Military Academy. some
cadets were pushing the point
when they insisted that mercy
killing should be considered in the
same category. A protest flurry
came up when the ”Right to Life”
organization mentioned that
confusion on these issues could
