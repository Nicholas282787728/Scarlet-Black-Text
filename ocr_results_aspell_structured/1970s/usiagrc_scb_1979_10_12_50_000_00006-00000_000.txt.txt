' At its October 4 opening, the Sum-
mation Gallery drew a fairly large aur
dience. Although it has started out
small, Voltz and Sheeder expect it to
grow, and hopeiully develop a follow-

ing as the year progresses,

The main question people seem to
have about the art gallery is: “Why
have it at all7 There are other oppor-
tunities for student art display on

campus " According to the explana-
tion at Summation Gallery next to the
American flag at the entrance, it was
started “to combat the sterility or
these institutional walls."

If you can’t get to Benny’s . . . .

It’s 1:59 a.m., you're hungry and
you don’t have the transportation or
‘ the money to go to Benny's. What do
you do? As you quiet your grumbling
tummy a thought comes to youimake
, a bakery run.
This Grinnell tradition has been goe
, ing on for about ten years. In 1969,
some unknown college student irom
California wanted to watch the bakers
make their morning goods. After wat-
ching for a few nights he asked if he
could purchase some doughnuts.

The baker obliged the student's re
quest, and soon the word got around
that fresh doughnuts could be bought
and were available when students
needed them most: in the wee hours of
the night when studying is over and

'the stomach yearns tor a treat.
. The Danish Maid Bakery, lounded in
' 949 by the father at the current
, wner. John Hansen otters over 30
kinds of doughnuts and other pastries.
The bakery also sells bread Cake, and
:dinner rolls during regular business
:hours.
< A recent investigation of the bakery
:revealed the following array of
oodies: ten different kinds of cookies
including Date Creme, Chocolate

Istudents as well as four year students,

Iiew Many of the students have come
to the United States for the first time
» The {ourVyear students come
rimarily to get a better education
» nd to experience a ditlerent way or
life. The United States otters the unis
que experience oi providing a wide
range or small colleges.
Grinnell otters a great deal at per-
sonal attention, and smaller classes
Exchange students, who are only
here lor one year, attend tor similar
;reasons. As exchage student Naoklo
~Mirna said, “I camehere to see how
Americans live and to discover a dif-
terent aspect of my own country by
visiting a foreign country'

Mirna, a 21 year- -old exchange stue
dent lroin Wasseda University in
Tokyo, Japan, came to Grinnell
through the Great Lakes Colleges

(Such as chocolaterovered, white-
i‘rosted, peanut-coated, coconut-
sprinkled, jimmicrspacklcd, and oven
plain), and iavorite pastries
(bismarcks, cremehorns, apple tarts,
longjohns, and cinnamon SWil‘lsl,

Many hours and hundreds or pounds
oi flour and sugar go into the produc-
tion of these late night munchahlt‘s
Hansen begins making his wares at
”‘00 pm and doesn't quit work until
noon the next day.

In a single night. Hansen reports us-

Associated Colleges of the Midwest
(ACM) exchange programs. She is a
psychology major and hopes to teach
elementary school alter completing
her education in Japan,

When asked why she chose Grlnnell,
Mima replied that she was very in
terested in the pre-school program. In
Japan, she is unable to conduct tests
and work with children the way she
can at the Grinnell College Preschool.

Perhaps the most significant dil-
fcrence she sees between Wasseda
University and Griiincll is the size oi
classes, and the way in which they are
conducted. There are no small col»
leges in Japan, only large universities.

Mirna said, “I'm doing what I really
want to do " She is involved iii the
preschool program, and playing the
harpsichord and tennis. activities she
does not otten get to do in Japan.

During tall break, She and Mayra
Solis, an exchange student irom Costa
Rica, plan to go to the Smokey Motili-
tains with the Grinnell Outdoor

this adds up to over 20,000 pounds of
flour, and more than 15,000 pounds at
sugar (all kinds) used to make the
bakery goods.

The Danish Maid Bakery is located
on Fourth Avenue across Irom Cun»
ngham’s Drugstore. It opens at 2:00
a m , Monday through Saturday, tor
selling doughnuts and cookies; fresh
bread is available after 4.00 am.
Regular hours are i to 5,

So, the next time you get a late
night attack of the “munchies," strike
back with a bakery run,

The cosmospolitan side of Grinnell

also has plans to visit New York and
parts or the East coast.

Mima is very glad she has come
here because people are very lriendly,
and she has a greater amount of
freedom.

Mayra Solis, also an exchange stu~
dent, is from Heredia, Costa Rica.
Unlike Mlma, Solis has completed her
education and has been teaching
English. She is essentially a graduate
student in English, having studied five
years at the University oi Costa Rica.
Her degree is weighted somewhere
between a B A, and an MA

Also a member oi the ACM pro
gram. alter a year at Grinnell she will
return to the University 0t Costa Rica
lor another two years to attain a
higher degree,

Although Solis will be receiving no
‘credit [or her work at Grinnell, this
does not bother her. She says she
came here to improve her English,
alid to better understand the
American way of life, She feels that it
it very important to have this basic
understanding oi the English I
