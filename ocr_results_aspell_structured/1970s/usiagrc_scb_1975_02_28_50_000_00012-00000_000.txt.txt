Gl'ilmcll Scarlet and Black. February, 28, 197%”, 12

Sometime ago I was struck with the
thought that, at several at older buildings
which have existed at one time or another on
this campus, the college has lew
photographs. Ancienland colossal Blair Hall
and the old Women's Gym come to mind.

Therelore, much to appease my own sense
of guilt as a phatugrapher, I spent a Sunday
afternoon in ARH, trying to caplure on lilm
some of its imagery.
