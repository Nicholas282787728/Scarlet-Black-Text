Summer Jobs.
In torra Plentitul

Iowa's summer job prospects are
good despite the energy crisis and
slumping economy, according to an
area director of the Iowa State
Employment Service.

Berhie Berger, a Marshalltown ole
ficial of the Service, said Sunday
that, although there would be fewer
jobs in service stations and manu»
Iacturing, added jobs in construc-
tion, farming, restaurant and lodg-
ing industries would more than take
up the slack

Speaking on the KDIC-FM public
affairs program, Dateline: Grinnell,
Berger also said out-offstate stu-
dents who feared not finding jobs
at home could probably count on
finding summer employmentin Iowa.

He said students considering sum-
mer work in Iowa should apply now
through the Grinnell office of the
Iowa State Employment Service, lo-
catcd in the Veteran’s Memorial
Building.

John Adams, Associate Director of

i the] Career Services Office, said
students seeking summer employ
ment should carefully investigate
the Iirrns they apply to. He said
that, if they have any doubts, they
should contact the state employment
service, Better Business Bureau,
or Chamber of Commerce before
starting their jobs.

Berger said many jobs would be
available in the four county area
around Grinnell which is tinder the
jurisdiction of his office.

leach Rakes

Rolling farmland, small manufac-
turlng cities, and the closest elec-
tions in the nation over the last
decade mark Iowa’s First CongreSs
sional District.

Jim Leach, a Davenport Republi
can, ls the only announced Candi
date to offer opposition to Demos
cratic incumbent Ed Mezvinsky of
Iowa City.

Leach was at Grinnell last week,
,seeking signatures tor his nomina-
tion papers and talking with “the
largest block, from aneutral point
of View, of voters who are not com-
mitted in one direction or another. "

A graduate oi Princeton Univers
Sity in 1964, Leach continued his
education at the School of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hop»
kins University and the London Sch~
001 of Economics, emphasizing ec—
onomics and Soviet IOlitICS.

JAMES LEACM

Leach has served as a State De
partment foreign service officer
and served as a delegate to the Ge-
neva Disarmament Conference and
the United Nations General Assem-
bly. He is currently president of
Flamegas, Inc., a family—owned en-
terprise which markets propane gas
in a tour state area.

He calls himeseli a “moderate"
Republican (”I'm not as liberal as
Ed Mezvinsky”) and he sees Cam-
paign financing ~- particularly Mez—
vinsky’s campaign financing »7 as
“a very very vitalissueinthis cam-
paign.”

Leach said he would limit individ»
ual contributions to his campaign
to $500 and that he would reiuseany'
cutrof-state or special interest mo»
ney. He says this offers a sharp
contrast to Mezvinsky’s campaign
Iunding practices in 1972.

Leach Claims that the Mezvinsky
campaign received $7,500 from the

dairy lobby, $20,000 Irom “eastern
unions,” and almost 90 per cent of
its tunds from Outrotsstate.

He said the dairy lobhy contribu-
tions were from the same source
as the donations to president Nix»
on’s re-election chart, and that
Mezvinsky subsequently voted tor
an increase in the parity price
of milk.

plan as one possible option.

“I think that we have to maintain
some sort of price for private fr
nance, particularly in limited sums
ot money The main thing is that
we have got to move away from
the concept of large gifts.”

Leach Ielt that a combination of
Watergate and Mezvinsky’s incum
bency would make his election di
ficult. “Watergate is the underly-
ing issue Of the campaign. It has to
be. It is the one truly popular is-

of the contributions to the Melvin-

Iowa.

But the contributions reﬂected lo—
cal support, he said, because the.
majority of the contributions were
made by national organizations atthe
request and largely at the expense

“This is a phony issue because
national support directly relates
to local support," Kent said.)
Leach was “dubious” about total
public financing of campaigns, but
felt that Congress should “moveto-

They Only Come Out at Night

by Sherman Boone

Some said it would never happen.
Others claimed that there would be
great danger involved. Still others
ran for fear of their lives.

But it happened, and happened wie
thout a hitch. Yes Iolks, the arm»
ual Loose Hall Ball was as succ-
essful as one could ever hopefor.
Darby Gymnasium was packed last
to Capacityr-as the student body
rocked from 9:30 until I a.m. to
the sounds oi the John Bailey Ex-
plosion, brought here direct, live
and in person all the way from Kas
nsas City.

Promoters Noble Young and Ellen
Rosker did an excellent Job in the
setting-up and coordinating of the
various features of the hall, which
included dancing, fine music, wine,
cheese and crackers, beerzndabar,

The most entertaining [eitures of
the Ball, however, werethe students
themselves. Not only were there
”Joe College” types clatl in blue
denims and T—shirts, but there was
also an amazingly exquisite assort-
ment of character types.

While in no way was it as color—
ful as the Loose Hall Bridal Show,
the hall did feature gangsters, lut-
men and "mulls" a’ la 1930's, a
fairly fairy Godmother, a “greas—
er" or two, a scantily garbed Pat—
rician senator, a giant frog and a
sixrtoot, three-inch transvestite
vampire elf. Not bad for lethargic

Grinnell students. . . _

Of course the hall, originally see
heduled to occur in the vicinity of
Valentine’s Day, was not. intended
to be an out-andsout costume pare
ty. And how much did the formali»
ties cost? According to tigurespro-
vided by promoter Young, the cost--
excluding the bandeetotaled a mere
$560, with a lot of the “slack”
being taken up by "donations” frs
om various dorms, the Initiative
Fund and SGA. Of this total, $40
was spent on cheese (supplied by
Saga). $ll5 on beer and $252 on
wine and booze. (I often wondered
how much it would cost to “blitz"
an entire campus.) The cost was
really not that prohibitive, consids
ering it comes out to about 50p
per student.

Of course there are many inter
esting stories and anecdotes that
will be recounted in the weeks to
come (or at least until Break) but
the most humorous heard by this
writer thus far involves the Dire»
ctor of College Services, Ralph
Pomerenk. The story, according to
Bob Jacobs anyway, is that Mr. Poe
merenk took a scientifically meas
ured portion of the gymnasium floor
to see what the effect of brew would
be on boards. Needless to say, the
use others who wound up on the He
oor Saturday night are indeed gratee

ful to this inquisitive administrator
for his experiments.

 

sue the Democrats have, and it
is something they are going to do
their best to keep before the pub-
lic mind, I doubt very much if we
will have a vote of impeachmentbe—
fore the election.”

While acknowledging that “Water-
gate is a rnillstone around every

Republican’s neck,” Leach did not ‘

divorce himself from the President.

“The President has done some
very forthright things for which I
think the people Should give him
credit, a lot of courage in areas
that haven’t been reflective of st~
rungly conservative points of vi—
ewl” Leach cited the detente with
Russia, the opening of relations
with the People’s Republic of Chi-
ha, and US involvement with negs
otiations in the Middle East. .

Leach said he is “withholding jud-
gement" on how he would vote on
impeachment, noting that the issue
is one that would require his know—
ledge of the evidence against Nixon.

Mezvinsky’s many liberal stances
have caused Leach to question Mez-
vinsky's ability to effectively repre—
sent his constituents. He Said that
Mezvinsky’s “liberal voting record
is an issue,” and criticized the
Congressman for failing to go on
record with speciﬁc remedies for
many national problems

Leach called for massive tax re~
forms directed at the oil industry,
and suggested breaking up some
large companies. “The oil com-
panies have used the shortage sit»
nation which has existed this last
year in this country to raise pri-
ces beyond those which I think
are justified.”

Leach tavors amnesty if it is
coupled with some form of compul-
sory alternative service for those
people “who made an individual
choice to leave.”

He Called capital punishment “the
ultimate depravation or freedom,"
saying he opposed measures to rein-
troduce the death penalty.

Leach plans a campaign started by
volunteers, noting that running “ags
ainst any incumbent in any year is
tough .. especially (againstjaDerm
ocrat in a Watergate year."
