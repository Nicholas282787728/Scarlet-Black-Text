Staggering numbers of students
enter Grinneil considering a pre-
med program Grinnell boasts one
of the finest science departments
in the country and has a con-
siderable reputation for getting its
students into medical school.
However, while the reputation
remains the same, the ﬁgures on
admission of Grinnellians to
medical school do not. The per-
centage of students accepted has
decreased trom close to ninety per
Cent [our and five years ago to 81.2
per cent during the years 1973-74,
and 53 3 per cent most recently.
tThis figure is still well above the
national average oi 329 per cent.l
Biology Protessor Irving Fish-
man, Chairman of the Health
Profession Advisory Committee
tthe committee overseeing the
med program), parallels Grin-
nell's recent failure to get its
students in medical school with a
national trend at more students
applying and thereiore less being
accepted He states that Grinnell
still has a line reputation among
medical school admission staffs for
producing line students and
writing accurate rer
ommendalions of candidates.
Fishman consxders the rear
commendation. written by the
committee. an important aspect oi
the admission procedure. The
committee attempts to write an
accurate, honest, two or three page
recommendation “as an adjunct to
the straight number game of GPA
and MCAT" (Medical College
Admission Test).
He notes that a medical school is
less likely to believe a college
which sends five outstanding

glowing recommendations than a
college which will send tWo ex-
cellent recommendations. two
recommendations of adequate,
well prepared students, and one
not recommending the particular
student.

Guillermo Mendoza, also a
biology professor and former
chairman of the committee, sees
the problem of reduced acceptance
as threefold, He mentioned the
tremendous crush of students
applying to medical school noting
that many admission staffs must
select 150 candidates out of 5,000
applicants.

He is more concerned, however,
with the excessive use of the MCAT
in judging students. He considers it
a poorly devised and used test in
lhat if one scores below a certain
grade his admission is almost
nullified. Only six per cent of the
applicants with GPA above 3.0 and
a MCAT score below 500 were
admitted to a medical school.

He is concerned that “many of
the bright students tat Grinnell)
are not taking the MCAT's
seriously" while many other
colleges otter courses in preparing
the student for the examination.
His last contention is that grades,
iormcrly a main judging criteria,
are not a distinguishing factor any
more since practically all students
have extremely high grade
averages. He cited the example or
a Phi Bctta Kappa student with a
3.5 average not being accepted at
any medical school,

obviously, the going is tough tor
any pre-med student. Mendoza
recommends applying to one's
home state med school and lots of
hard work.

The otf~campus housing system
for GrinneIl-Rush medical students
has often been accused of isolating
its members from other Grin-

The Gi'innelI-Rush students,

and elitist. are twelve individuals,
ten of whom live at 1002 and 1019
Park Street, (The remaining two
have apartments.)

When the first Grinnelerush
participants arrived at the
beginning oi last year, they
became residents at 10oz Park
Street and at a second, but non
college owned, house, This policy
of separate housing is being con-
tinued, presumably because it
worked well last year in the minds
oi many. however, a lack of
communication arises because of
this barrier and thus destroys any
good which might otherwise come

irom the housing division.

The only other disadvantage
from the point of View of the med
student was that studying can take
on epidemic proportions. No one
can make an excuse for not
studying. because he knows he
does have the same courses as his
busilyrstudying housemates

Although some people
acknowledge that last year's group
of Grinnelerush-ers were almost
invisible and that their par-
ticipation in the activities or the
rest oi the campus was limited.
today's group thinks oi itseli as a
real part of the college. And, even
though they’ve nicknamed
themselves “The Lemmings"
(because where one goes, they
“all" goito class, to labs. to Quad.
to the PEC). their friends are not
exclusively drawn irom within
their small Circle. As Denis
Branson said. “I think We're as
much a part oi the Grinnell
community as tparlicipants inl a
program like this can be."

in the opinion of the med
students in collegeowned housing,
being on full board helps them
meet and interact With the rest of
the campus. Participation. ior lhe
first time. in intramural football
also brings them more iully into
general campus liie.

Many advantages ot’the separate
medstudent housing u ere cited by
the Park Street residents. At the
beginning oi the year the Grinnell-
Rush students arrive earlier than
the majority of the Grinnell
College community Being close to
each other during those first days
brings about a general iamiliarity
With fellow med studenls, before
the onslaught oi other Grln~
neIIians tSince all but three of the
Grinnell-Rush people had
previously attended colleges or
universities other than Gl‘innellv

: this was especially helpful.)

In addition, since all med
students lake the same or similar
course loads. the house lends to be
much quieter than an ordinary
dorm floor would be. No one has to
rim around asking others to
"Please! Be quiet: I'm trying to
study ' -

The fact that these students are
isolaicd in housing, and also in
mosl of their courses. still leaves
the impression that they are a
separate group within Grinnell
College. Gary Dausmann. who
attcnded the University oi Denver.
stated. "I don't lccl that I'm
strictly in medical school, cul off
from the rest of [he Griilnell
community. Living in thc house
doesn't seem to isolate us.”
