Women’s Role Slowly Changing

by Ann Cassel

Hiring women and creating an ac
ceptable working atmosphere for
women on the Grinnell College came
pus has become an issue of major
importance only withinthe lastyear.

Two reasons for the suddenrecog-
nition of the issue were given by
Mary Gae Wyly, Associate Librarr
ian and Instructor in Music.

The Department of Health, Educar
tion and Welfare began to put preSr
sure on colleges and universities
within the last yearto practice equal
opportunity employment. In Ms, Wy-
ly's words, “The administration was
runningrscared,"

“Last year was the first yearthere
was an upsurge of interest in wom»
en's liberation." Consciousness
raismg groups among the women ia-
culty and faculty wives wereformeti
and women's needs on the Campus
were discussed and enumerated.

Beth Noble, Professor of Spanish,
disagreed on this pointby sayingthat
most of the women in the forefront
of the push for women’s rights on
Campus last year were not affiliated
with women's liberation She added,
”I don't have to become liberated
because I already am.”

During the last academic year {3*
Culty women who had worked here
in the last five years Submitted
formal documents of requests for
change to the administration, These
requests included the need for sa-
lary adjustments, the appointment of
women to faculty and facultysstudent
committees, and a women consultant
,to the Executive Council. The ration-
ale behind these requests was the
reeling that if new women faculty
were to be hired the environment
for women already employed would
be improved,

Salary adjustments have been made
for the most part and women are
generally paid on the same basis
as men But according to Jean King,
Assistant Professor of Physical Ed-

ucation, there is at least one case
where this is not true, She affirmed, f
though, that on the whole, improve

ments have been made in the salare
ies of women faculty members.

Equal representation of women on
committees is a difficult request to
fulfill due to the present ratio of
women and men on the fullrtime far
culty. Twelve women are employed
as full-time faculty as compared to
91 men. As Ms. Noble stated, “You
can’t get up and scream about pute
ting women on committees when
there aren’t any.”

As for a consultant to the Execu-
tive Council, as Ms. Wyly said,
“The Executive Council consults
who it wants to consult." Ms, Noble
expressed concern about women as
regular members of the executive
council, pointing out that there had
only been two women members since
she's been here.

Ms. King referred to the adminis-
tration’s reaction to proposals made
by women last year in a meeting
with Eva Cadwallader, a Candidate
for a position in the Philosophy
department. “They made a lot of
brash promises last year that they
didn't live up to, but they're work-
ing on it."

There was also concern last year
among both faculty and students
about the male domination of the far
culty and a push was made by facul—
ty women ior the hiring of more
women faculty. Ms. Noble stressed
that these women should be highly
qualified, full—time women. She exA
plained that women in partstime and
lecturer positions are “last on the
totem pole" and are often cut from
the staff as soon as money gets tight,
Women on this campus ‘need to
“move from a strong base” of tulle
time women who are able to"moves
up”.

The college advertised that they
were especially looking for womenin
the available openings and six new

Student Canvass Urges Support

Twenty-eight students have been canvassing members ofthe Grin~
nell faculty during the week to identify the extent of faculty support
for a possible reconsideration of the decision taken at last week’s
faculty meeting to close faculty meetings to outside observers.
The canvas, now in its final stages, will also hopefully identify
some of the reasonsfortheexclusion oi non-members from faculty
meetings held by those who support the new policy.

Anne Walter, SGA VicerPresident who has been involved along

with other

members of the SGA cabinet in organizing the canvas,

told the SittB Thursday thntallhough the resultsare not yet complete
she has been “encouraged by the amount of interest shown by both
students and faculty in the matter.”

Ms Walter has this Week been able to find a faculty member who
was anxious to make the motion to reconsider, and is therefore
confident that the issue will he again raised at (in upcoming faculty

meeting

The motion [0 reconsider must be made by a person who

voted for the move at the time of its original presentation.

women faculty were hired. ButWaldo
Walker, Dean of Administration,

' “We didn’t make as great a
gain as we had hoped...we don‘t feel
we have enough.”

Departmental hiring of women was
done under pressure oi the Execus
tive Council and the administration
last year according to Ms. Wyly.
She stated that most of the faculty
hired after the first of May were
men. Both Ms. Noble and Ms. Wyly
expressed the concern that the de-
partments didn’t make a sincere
effort to hire women, but did Soonly
when pressured from above.

Problems Connnue
Willi Concert Plans

by John Wylie
Problems continue to plague Grinnell’s concerts and public Events
programs, The last minute replacement oi Indian dancer Manjursi is only
the latest in a series of headaches which have hounded members of the
Social Coordinating and Public Events Committee. Pacific World Attrac—
lions, the New York hocking agency which handles Manjursi’s engage-
ments, received a wire from the dancer on Monday saying that she would

be unable to make her United States tour,

Rod McVeigh, who was handling
the concert for the Committee, im-
mediately set out to find a replace-
ment. After consulting the Com-
mittee, he agreed to a replacement
concert by a better known male dan-
cer, Ehaskar, who dances with afa—
male partner.

According to McVeigh, Eashkar is
normally booked for a higher price
than the Committee had planned to
pay Manyursi, The Committee feels
that the cancellation may actually
result in the Campus getting a bet-
ter performance for the money being
spent. All tickets already issued
for the Manjursi concert are valid
for the new performance, which will
be presented, as scheduled, at 8:00
pm Saturday in Roberts Theatre.

Concerts]?

Elliott Lewis and the Social Coor-
dinating Committee have also been
plagued with uncertainty and last
minute cancellations.

Members of the Committee had
been assured by the prime booking
agent for Commander Cody and the
Lost Planet Airmen that he was
“90% sure” the group could and
would perform at Grinnellon Nov-
ember ll. However, the tentative ar-
rangement was cancelled only a few
weeks before the scheduled concert

Several other performers inclu »

ing Boz skaggs and Larry Corry-
ell, were contacted by the Com-
mittee, but none were able toappear.
Final arrangements for the Banana
and the Bunch and Mighty Joe Young
appearance were not completed until
Thursday eveninguless than 48
hours before the scheduled concert.
Pro Musica - Still

Members of the Public Events
Committee continued to be under
fire for the mishandling ofsome as
pects of the New York Pro Musica
concert at Grinnell last month. in
a three page report prepared hyAs-
sistant Student Coordinator John
Turnbull , lack of organization in the
planning for ticket distribution,
domination of the Committee by far
culty, and an expensive private rec
caption for Pro Musica which was
closed to all but a few students
and faculty members were cited as
serious problems.

That report concluded by noting
that improvements had already been
made in the Committee structure,
including the appointment ofa stu—
dent member ot coordinate each of
the remaining events. Turnbull also
noted that Mr. Dawson, currently
Chairman of the Committee, had exv
pressed a desire to “not become
associated as a member of the com-
mittee in the future".

New ISPIRG Head Voices Concern

by Ken Winokur

The purpose of lSFlRGisgenerally
thought to be to improve the stan-
dard of physical envtronment in
Iowa. According to MaryJane Wynn,
newly elected state board chairper-
son fOr IowaY this is the effect, but
not the main focus.

“The most important thing is to
increase public involvement in the
public decision making process; in
government, on school boards, crin
corporation production. It’s an at-
tempt to inform the public and give
them input.” Inshort,it’sanattempt
to urge the public to “lake initias
tive"

Ms, Wynn does notdiscount the
more concrete aspects of ISPIRG.
She has plans to promote several
important programs at Crinnell
looking into: legislative monitoring,
organic farming, and consumeredue
cation. She feels that her most ims
portant duty is to act as a “catal-
yst”. "ISPIRG is now in the stage
of going from argnnizing to getting
people charged up with research.”

Opposes New [PC Plan

by Anne Walter

One of the items before the faculty next Tuesday is a recommendation
from the AllsCollege Educational Policy Committee to increase the stu—
dent membership on the Divisional EPC’S from two, as defined by the
original legislation, to one student representative from each department.
This item seemingly a minor structural change, becomes more signifi-
cant in light of the recentlyrpassed proposal from the Faculty Organiza-
tion Committee to close faculty committee meetings to all nonvmembers.
The new legislation is fuzzy on the point of these particular committees
(the Divisional EPC’S are under the Alerollege EPC, which is a subs
committee of the Faculty Executive Council), but if it applies it would
reduce the Divisional EPC student participation to a maximum of only
two individuals.

The proposal from the All-College EPC arose out of a desire to alleviate
some of the confusion that prevails in the Divisional committees. The
original legislation, which provides for two student representatives,
hardly coincides with the actual current practice. The students in most
departments elect individuals to the Departmental EPC from which
a representative to the Divisional EPC is selected; therefore, each der
partment is in fact represented on the Divisional arc. The messy part,
however, comes in when it is time to vote on an issue.

Who is going to decide how the two student votes will be cast? Will there
be two real student members and 377, depending on the division, semi-
or secondsclassmembers? Will this privilege of membership rotate from
meeting to meeting or be decided by lot? This situation becomes more
absurd when taken in Context with the purpose and working procedures
of the Educational Policies Committees. The EPC'S are designed as forums
for discussion of courses, departmental and' divisional programs and
needs, the pros and cons of such questions as the need for major require-
ments, credit limitations, and criterion for the granting of credit. During
the meeting individuals have the opportunity to air their special concerns
and raise questions about the particular course or policy question being

disc ssed.
