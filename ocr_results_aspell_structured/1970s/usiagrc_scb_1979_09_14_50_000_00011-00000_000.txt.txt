SaintrSaens. and Bruck. That, of
course, it you don‘t count Carole
King’s Tapestry alhum. King played
the cello for You've Got a Friend and
Way over Yonder in that record.

Although he has never done a solo
album, Ken Goldsmith has done extenr
sive work in T.V., commercials. and
movies. He worked on the soundtrack
from the movie The Godfather.

The reviews of the recordings by the
Mirecourt have all been exceptionally
good. If you‘ve always thought
chamber music was something only
played at bridge clubs, try something
by the Trio, you’re likely to be
pleasantly surprised.

Trio televised

this weekend

The Mirecourt Trio will be featured
in a special hour-long program on the
Iowa Public Broadcasting Network on
Sunday, Sept. 16, at 9 pm, The pro-
gram will be aired on all IPBN chan-
nels, including Channel 11, Des
Moines, and Channel 12, Iowa City.

The presentation. entitled “The
Mirecourt Trio at Salisbury House: An
18th Century Concert," was taped in
the Great Hall of one of the most
magnificent mansions in the Midwest.

Surrounded by priceless antiques
and art objecB in Des Moines‘
Salisbury House, the Mirecnurt plays
works by Mozart, Beethoven, and
Johann Hummel.

To try to reproduce as faithfully as
possible the way the music sounded to
an 18th century audience, the trio uses
Grinnell College’s Broadwood piano,
which was built in 1804 and is an exact
duplicate of one owned by Beethoven.

The group will be heard playing the
Trio in c Major by Mozart, the
Trio in G Major of Beethoven, and
the “Turkish Rondo" irom Hummel’s
Trio Concertanle in F Major.

Besides performing these works, the
members at the group will discuss
18th century music and the difficulties
involved in trying to duplicate the
sound as the composer heard it on
contemporary instruments.

An IPBN cultural presentation, the

ragram is produced and directed by

mmy-Award winner John Beyer. The
one-hour special is the second that
IPBN has completed on the Mirecourt
Trio, one of the country's outstandivrﬁ
chamber ensembles.
