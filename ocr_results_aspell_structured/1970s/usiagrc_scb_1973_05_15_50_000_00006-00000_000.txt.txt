committees, leaving one with the detinite
impression that perhaps the pressure had
seemed more ominous than it actually was.

Much oi the campus, as letters in the 5518
pointed out, felt the whole thing was just
people looking {or an excuse to get out oi
work they should have had done longbetore.

The Library Take-Over

The real crisis or the year, the one
which will probably have the most long-
range eitects on college policy, was the
take—over ot the library in November by
members oi Concerned Black Students,
along with a Black Manifesto distributed
to the entire college community explain—
ing the move and listing demands.

Campus opinion was widely split on the
issue, ranging trom iull support to unsp—
eakable bitterness and a parody “Mani—
testo." CBS held meetings with students
and Trustees clariiying its position, and
undertook extensive negotiating sessions
with the administration.

in the end, President Leggett, along with
the Trustees, agreed to the institution or
a black studies mayor, the creation oi an
Admissions Board for Black Students and
the rounding oi a black library and black
housing committee. He also agreed to look
into the other demands, related to lood,
entertainment and oounslling, and see it
any of them were feasible,

The issue smoldered under the surface
despite this agreement, and in February
a group of CBS members, frustrated by the
slowness in establishing the black library,
began removing books from the 20th
Century Room and replacing them with books
relating to Black Studies, This met with a
firm stand by Dean Waldo Walker, who calls
led tor a quick end to the proceedings, and
received little campus support. The issue
was resolved when a section of the 20th
Century Room was set aside for the Black
Library.

The Nasser Hiring

Just as the library takeovers were waning
as subjects of conversation d debate, we
were involved in another cri one which
more at the campus could relate to as ins
siders, as participants, instead oi simply
supporters or opponents.

This was the whole question oi the con-
tract oi Alan Nasser, Instructor in Phila-
saphy and avowed Marxist. At the suggess
tion oi the Philosophy Department, in oppose
ition to the student~EPC, Nasser’s contract
was not renewed tor the year 1972-73.

ﬂint Scarlet and lildtk v]—

Nasser brought what was normally a conll~
dential decision berore the whole campus,
accusing the administration at a lack of
trust and irankness in reaching and ration-
alizing its decision.

student interest in the issue grew, and
eventually a list ol student demands, inn
eluding equal representation on all EPC’s
as well as Nasser’s rehiring, was presen-
ted to President Leggetti A reconsidera—
tion at the entire question brought a reaiis
irmation oi position on both sides. Final
resolution oi the issue did not come until
Nasser's resignation was received during
the summer.

Responses to the Bombing

The college reacted quickly and violently
to President Nixon’s announcement of re-
newed bombing in Southeast Asia, a reac-
tion that was shared across the nation.

Six students began a last and encouraged
others either to join them orto show support
in other ways; an iniormation center was
set up to coordinate all anti~war eiiarts
on campus and to keep up with antiwar
movements throughout the country; a letter
writing campaign was begun to all Senators
and Congressmen; an ad was placed in the
Des Momes Register calling for a bomb-
ing halt; marches through the town were
held on three successive evenings, with
over 600 people, students, faculty and
townspeople, involved in each one, a one-
day strike was approved, with many al—
ternate activities set up; information booths
were established on the sidewalks of town,
in an eiiort to make the town more aware
at what was going on.

Was any or this successlul, or at least
meaningiul? We heard that question many
times during this hurry oi activity and cer-
tainly afterward, and oiten asked it our-
selves, And who is to be the judge? This
crisis, perhaps more than any other which
had involved the campus that year, was
a real one, one 0! actual lite and death.
And we had showed concern, and tried to
have an eiiect.

The college did not close that year, as
it had in 1970, and many tried to discern
why, to evaluate the difference in “mood",
in the type 01 student or the type of crisis.
Perhaps it was, as some said, a recogni-
tion of the futility of the 1970 action. But
the feeling on campus was a positive one,
not one of deieat. We had taken another
stand, not as great, perhaps, but a clear
and deﬁnite one, It was not total coma
mitment that year, but it certainly was
total concern,

when we returned to Grinnell in the (all
at ‘72 to begin our ﬁnal year, many changes
had taken place. The old women’s gym
had been torn down and for the ﬁrst time
we could see North Campus [mm the Forum
without obstruction, Waldo Walkerwastohe
the new Dean of the college, theadministra»
tion had a new home in the old White House
(renamed Nollen House in honor ol'a for»
mer Grinnell president), and our student
government had a couple or vacancies as
the result of the resignation of two class
members, Terry Wolf and Loren Hart, as
Student Coordinator and Student Auditor,
respectively.
Women’s Gym

The demise ol the women’s gym had been
a longtime in coming. Constructed in 1900
under President Gates, it had long been a
source of irritation tor the college cum~
munity because at the lack oi upkeep and
the tendency of the structure to crumble.
Despite protests irom those who admired
the unique architecture, President Leggett
iniormed the college community of the im»
pending demolition by letter shortly alter
the close of the ”ll-72 school year.
Wrecking crews began the removaloperas
tion in midaJune and brought the building
down with a couple of well-placed blows.
The main supporting beams, it turned out,
had cracked completely through, leaving

little support for the walls and ceiling.
Within a low weeks alter school began,
sodding ol the lormer site was complete
and students were trudging across the
grass where, only a low months betore,
the old building had been standing.

Walker Becomes Dean

The appointment or Dean olAdministratlon
Waldo Walker to the post vacated by Dean
Wall’s resignation aroused little surprise.
Walker and Wall had begun pertormlng ad-
ministrative duties together uponthe resig-
nation of Dean James Strauss in 1969, and
when Wall left the Deanship to resume
teaching Walker was the “overwhelming
choice,” in the words or President Leggett,
of virtually the entire college community.

James Hamilton, a Grinnell graduate oi
1965 and Assistant ProlessoroiEconumics,
was appointed to the newly—created position
of Associate Dean of the College to assist
Walker in both the academic and business
areas.

Alter thirteen years in “temporary" quar—
ters in the library of Hurling basement
the administration in 1973 finally moved
into its own home~Nollen House. Presi-
dent Leggett and Deans Wall, Walker, and
Hamilton were given the second lloor (the
one with the better View), and “Nollen
Second” was to become campus Jargon for
the center of administrative power
