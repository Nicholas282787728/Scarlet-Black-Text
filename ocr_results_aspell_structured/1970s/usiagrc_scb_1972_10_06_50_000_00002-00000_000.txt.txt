Instructor HaroldKasimowis a new
and welcome member of the also
new Religious Studies Department,
He is noted not only tor his class-
work but also (or helping the Jew-
ish students on campus learn and
preserve their culture

Mr. Kasimow said that he realizes
many students may have lost inter
est in religion due to the tormal,
and often uninteresting religious
programs that they were exposed to
when they were young. The courses
and activities that he is directing
are aimed at promoting a desire to
learn “There is a very good Spire
it here. More and more people are
interested intinding something about
their tradition and culture."

Although there is no {Ormal Jew~
ish organization, students, with the
help and guidance otMr. Kasimow,

on on all Jewish holidays. Also,
classes are being taught in Hebrew,

Born in Lithuaniabeiorethesecond

Germany, and eventually to New
York. He attended the Jewish Theor
logical Seminary, for live years,
and thendid graduatewoi-k atTcmple
University. He is currently work-
ing on his dissertation for his mas-

Mr. Kasimow chose to come to
Grinnell because here he would be
able to teach more of religion than

The SGA also provides the lead
ership required tor the smooth and
etiective operation or the dayrtor
day matters brought beiore the slur
dent body. The elected represenr
tatives oi the student body have the
task of actively campaigningior stur
dent interests, and making decisions
regarding those interests that re
ilect the mood and temper oi the
student body at large, Those repre~
sentatlves should investigate, and
indeed scrutinize, the existing pros
grams on campus, and either leave
well enough alone or encourage reg
term or abandonment of those pros
grams that are useless or deleter-
io‘us to the student body and the
college community. implicit in this
is the responsibility of introducing
novel ideas ior social and academic
progress within the community.

Overall, the SGA leadership should

before the iaculty and the adminlsr
tration,

Finally, the SGA has allowed it
sell to remain both flexible and mo
bile enough so that it may change
its direction and/or priorities at
will, or so that it can deal with
issues of immediate concern or of
crisis nature Without a breakdown
of structure. The committee strucs
ture becomes one oi investigation
and recommendation, and one that,
on issues at extreme importance
on issues of extreme importance,
can be bypassed. Hence, the Joint
Board may choose not to refer a
matter to a committee, but to han-
die it itselirrli it is of prime im»
portance or ii it is by nature lim—
ited in time. The option is there.
In conclusion, I would posit [our
major functions [or the Student Gov
ernment Association, 1) to serve
as a iorum tor student opinion and
activity, and as 2i ”Sounding board”
to the campus at large for student
interests; 2) toprovidealneohanism

transterring that sentiment into proe
grams tor constructive change; a)
to provide adequate representative
leadership tor student voice and
action; 4) to remain flexible and
mobile so as to easily racilitate
any student request, movement, or
direction. All Of these functions
directly deal with the responsibilr

just Judism. He is interested in
many ot the eastern religions, es-
pecially lslam This is alsotherea-
son that he decided to go into ed-
ucation instead of becoming a Rab-
bi. “it's felt that it you’re going
to become a rabbi, you can’t i -
volve yourself in other traditions

He feels that “a study of other res
ligions might be looked downupon ”
Although Grinnell College is some
what isolated from all other Jewish
communities, Professor Kasimow
ieels that the Students are not par
ticularly disadvantaged, “It a stur
dent goes to college in New York
City, he doesn't leel anything spec-
ial about his religion. He takes it
(or granted. Here, when students
are away lor the tirst time, it
seems more precious Most stus
dents aren't interested in synago-
gues anyway, Grinnell has no tor-
mal organization, but there is more
happening here than many schools
with iormol organizations. He cone
cedes that being this isolated can be
a problem for some. “There are

some students who would rather go
to a rabbi.”

Since there is no synagogue here
in Grinnell transportation has been
arranged to a Des Mollies temple
on holidays. Because it is impracs
tical to go to Des Moines every
week, Mr, Kosimow is holding an
informal religion class on Fridays.

Mr, Kaslmow explained that hewas
pleased with the new Religious Stur
dies Department, ”Considering that
it‘s the lust year for the depart
ment, and that we’ve Just gotten
started, 1 am very happy, I'm also
happy that there is such a great
interest in taking religion courses.
The courses were Closed even he—
tore the freshmen had a chance to
register. There’s a great attraor
tion to religion, All over the counr
try religion departments are open-

have to enlarge itselt because of
the great demand,
