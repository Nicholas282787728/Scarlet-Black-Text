most oi the game. Knox ended the
Contest with a school record of 36
offensive plays. Despite this, the
Grinnell deiense played extremely
well. Bowers thought Ken

Pioneer coaches regard Monmouth
as this year's toughest rival.

serves in \‘l’edilesday's match here with Central College. Mc-
Fadden, who plays in the top position, came out on the short end of

formance of the season in lhe
upcoming two iinal games, Coach
Cindy Winkler thinks her squad is
ready to put it all-together. The
team travels to Graceland on
Saturday and meets Iowa in Iowa
City on Wednesday for the final tilt.

Getting on the scoreboard early
will be the objective of the
Pioneers as they face Graceland,
an aggressive team that they heat
er earlier in the season.

After playing undeieated and
untied Northern Iowa to a 070 tie in
Cedar Falls on Friday, Grinnel]
dropped a 1-0 decision to Luther on
Saturday, making its record 2732

In what Winkler called an
“exciting experience," the
Pioneers quickly adjusted to the
artificial turf in the UNI dome in
play an even game with the host
team. Winkler mentioned the
excellent play oi the entire deiense
and praised goalie Stephanie
Nelson for some fine saves.

On Saturday, Luther scored
midway through the tirst hall,
while the forward line of Grinnell
never generated an attack.
Winkler called it a “blah game,”
but mentioned that with a new
offensive pattern and continued
good work by the deiense, the team
should pull together for the final
two games,

down, making the final score
