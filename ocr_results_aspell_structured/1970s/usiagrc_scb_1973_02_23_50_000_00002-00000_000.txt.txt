Renowned in the world of Japan—
ese literature, Professor Donald
Keene has amassed an incredible
list of honors. Yet, his personality
is not an overbearing one. Instead,
he is quiet~spoken and somewhat
shy. As he speaks, one feels one
is only catching a glimpse at him,
as one would a dew drop on a bra
nch on a misty, Japanese spring
day.

Presently, Dr. Keene is in the se-
cond year ol a threeeyear con.
tract with Columbia in which he
teaches and is on campus hall oi
the year. The other half of the
year, he goes back to Japan to do
research, “I've been working on a
history or Japanese literature...
It’s endless. It seems that whene
ever I think I’m Iinished, someone
comes along and tells me about an
author they think is very impor-
tant and whom I have nevel‘heard
of before!"

But a smile spreads over his
face. ,
Donald Keene is also one at the
translators of Japanese literature.
“But one can't live on translat-
ing alone....For instance, French,
one can do that in a hall an hour,
sitting in lront oi a typewriter.
But with Japanese, you have to
read it and let it soak in and ass

similate by itself And then, make
it sound like English in the end!”

The languages themselves diiier
radically: “English is monosylla-
bic. Japanese is polysyllabic This
can cause a problem if one is tran»
slating poetry. .Words have shape
and color.,..For instance, kanashii,
because oi its very long sound,
conveys much more than the word
‘sad’ does in English

The Japanese have words that we
do not have. For instance, they have
words for two colors together, as in
a kimono. There is a word...iorwhe
lie with red showing through from
a layer underneath...And all one can
do in translating is to write a des-
cription."

According to Dr. Keene, descrip—
tion and detail is what distinguishes
Japanese literature from that of
any other language “English wri-
ters are so vague, They say, ‘She
came in like the wind.’ Japanese
writers would describe her cloth-
ing, the way she Walked.

Banquet. In it, he described some
kinds oi patterns, ways of dyeing a
kimono, which Icouldn’t understand,
In the same book, he had a menu

dividual department size and compo:
sition ought to be discussed in the
appropriate EPC's. As these would
not be confidential matters either
in actuality or by delinition, any
recommendations and accompanying
rationales may address themselves
directly to the issues rather than
merely insinuating them.

In summation, by realizing and acts
ing upon the realization that the
departmental composition oithe cole

tion and not a personnell question
as this Is currently defined, Grine
nell can rationalize its process of
educational policy making simulta—

her, She was the expert on thatl
And when I asked him about those
dishes, he said he didn‘t know what
they were either-me had called up
a restaurant and asked them to send
him the recipes or their three most
expensive dishes, and that's what
they had sent him!

HI think Mishima is one at the few
writers who does not knowthe coune

grew up in the city And yet in all
Of his works, he describes nature in
great detail.

"Most people don't believe me when
I tell them this, "Professor Keene
recalled, “I was with Mishima...
we were walking around the garden
and (perhaps tor use in the novel
he was working on) Mishima asked
the gardener what that certain tree
was. Well, even I knew that—-It was
a pine tree There are different
kinds oi pine trees, and the gardener
told him it was 0-matsu. The name
means male pine tree. There’s ano—
ther kind of pine:..which means fer
male pine tree. Well, Mishima went
through all the trees in the garden
and it so happened that they were all
o-matsu. And Mishima said, ‘Itthese
are all o-matsu, how do they get
baby matsu?’

Often, when one becomes involved
with a ioraign country, one becomes
disillusioned with his own country,
the ioreign country, or both, EutDr.
Keene said thoughtfully, "I have
never gone through that...But I may
yet-»one never knows about these
things!"

He vehemently professed though:

is the gossip. in New York, people

in other ways though, he contessed,
“I do iind myseltbecoming more and
more attracted to Japan." And per
