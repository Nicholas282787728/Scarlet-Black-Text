by Lynn Voedisch

Pub Club, inc, or the campus
pub to be situated in Main Hall's
Gardner Lounge, will swing into
operation soon this semester. Alter
a run with legal snags and construce
tion delays the pub is now well
under way, with the oiiicers ready
to accept memberships in the near
iuture. Construction should be it-
nished in two weeks.

Plans for the pub had been held
up since last spring by conilicts
over city zoning ordinances. Pre-
viously, Grinnell College was sit-
uated within a strictly residential
area. which precluded the establish—

Mark Nissen, the pubs manager,
said that this presented the City
Attorney with a chance to evaluate
all the zoning laws dealing with the
College. Since such businesses as
SAGA food service have been opere
ating on campus ior years, the city
felt the zoning ordinances needed
evaluation.

The ordinances were not changed
but amended to make business activ
vities on campus acceptable. Nissen
said that Grinnell was presented with
the chance to adequately spell out
permissable College activities.

Think that the school. year is too
long already? Well, stop complaine

prolonged their toureoi-duty two
weeks to write extra papers and read
extra books.

These now seasoned Grinnellians
participated in an extended rresh-
man orientation aimed at better pre-
paring them for Grinnell academic
life.

This new program arose out or
discussions by the college's 1“an

to Dean Jim Hamilton, it was de-
cided that “many” Grinnell stu—
dents could beneiit irom a program
that would reinforce reading and
writing skills. The eighteen stu-
dents were chosen from the list oi
freshmen already admitted to the
College.

The program is an extension oithe
Freshman tutorial and has the same
goals oi teaching composition and
reading skills, “but moreso.“ Acc-
ording to Dean Hamilton, these stu-
dents required some extra exper-
ience in these areas. “We could have

Although it is too early to judge
the eiiectlveness or the program,

Patterson said that he “would ale

he had a “large jump” on the school

Ihe sameiidea, “Instead oi coming
to school and being Shot in the
face with all oi the work, we had
an introduction,” Not everyone was
entirely enthusastic. One student
was not entirely sure that the pro—
gram was worth all oi the time
and eiiort, and compared it to her
“7th grade orientation.”

Mr. Charles Davis, one of the
instructors in the two week pro-
gram remarked that, “i'vc per-
sonally seen a markedimprovement
in composition and critical reading.
The initial kickofi oi the first two

rial in the upcoming year."

Emphasis was placed on the indi-

problems. The use oi school and
community resources such as the
Revolving Door, the Resident Ade

The student Advisors are pertorme

students oi each ﬂoor, the Resi-
dent Advisors and the house presi—
dents. Joint meetings with the SA,
HP, and RA will continue through
the year.

For an example oi the actual iunc-
tion oi the SA, the students played
the Freshman Simulation Game. Ee-
sides being useiul in understanding
how to handle iloor problems, every-
one iound it very enjoyable.

One SA remarked that the orient-

not being too hectic. The test Oi

l-‘irst, all bicycles in Grinnell
should be registered with the
police department. Registration
is a simple process, requiring «
a short visit to the police de-
partment where a description
of the bicycle, its serial num-
ber, and the name and address
or the owner are recorded.

Each bicycle is then issued al
license. The cost is only 25c,

and the benefit isabetter chance
of recovery if a bicycle is sto—

Second, anytime a bicycle is
left unattended 7 even briefly r
it should be locked, preierably
chained to a solid stationery
object.

Peters stressed that the pres
sent situation is not unusual,
and that bicycle theft is a con-
tinual problem ior all police
departments.
