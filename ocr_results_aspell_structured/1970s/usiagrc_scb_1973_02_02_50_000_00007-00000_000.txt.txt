I, Walden III By Henry Wilhelm

by Tom Graumun

Across from the old Grinnell
train depot is the home of Henry
Wilhelm, a Grinnell College drop—
out and former criminal. To a few
he may be considered a social der
viant but he is better recognized
in international circles as one ofthe
outstanding producers of photogra-
phic equipment. In its tirst tew
years, Henry's East Street Gallery
has achieved such fame, that Henry
calmly states, “Almost every ser-
ious photographer has heard oius."
The East Street Gallery has never
advertised but has relied instead
on reierences made in photograe
phic journals and books, including
the Time-Life series. Henry has
published a manual which also serv
ves as a catalog. Used by numerr
ous universities as a text, Henry
has sold some 12,000 copies. In a
small, oneeroom workshop in the
basement of the partially refurbish»
ed house known as the East Street
Gallery, Henry and four other work—
ers produce print and film washers.
The level of demand far exceeds
their production schedule so that
the current demand will occupy them
until J11

gested, they would nonetheless elect
the same chairmen as presently sit
as a result ot seniority. The
problem, according to the Senator,
lies with the legislators themselves.

Hughes compared recent Presi-
dents to kings who ran their govern»
ments by decree, force, and intimie
datioh. Only when the people rise
and protest Congressional acquiee
sence in such rule would Congress
act to change it. What is needed,
said the senior Senator, is a change
in the nation’s conscience.

When, at one point, Hughes noted
that Congress had the legal power
to stop the president by impeach-
ment, the audience broke into wild
applause. It was the longest inter—
ruption of the afternoon. The Sena-
tor later" felt constrained to note that
he had only stated the {act that ime
peachment is Congress’ ultimatele-
gal recourse against the president.
He strongly stated that he had not
meant to suggest impeachment pro-
ceedings against Mr. Nixon.

Hughes personally pledged that he
would do his utmost to oppose Pres-
idential power. He promised to act
”in committees, on the iloor, on
appointments and during the budget
hearings” to bring the focus oigov-
ernment back into the Capitol. He
acknowledged that concerted action
by Congress to reassert its Consti-
tutional rights might precipitate a
serious crisis. But, hedeclared, “Ii
it takes a 'crisis to set things right,
then Congress should instigatea cri-
sis." This comment drew warm ap~
plause.

When Hughes had ﬁnished speaking
the door was opened to questions.
The majority of the questions came
from residents of Des Moines’ Model
Cities area. They claimed that the
program was moribund and inimical
to community interests, and asked
Hughes what he would do to fix
this (Sen. Clark had left earlier
to catch a plane), Hughes responded
by pledging his continued support
of Model Cities, and urged his inter-
locuters to organize politically and
use their power to pressure their
representatives to react to their
complaints. Schwengel also voiced
his concern over the complaints,
and pledged his support oi action to
change the situation for the better.

Responding to a query about abor-
tion, Hughes became solemn. “I’m
not a liberal in this area," he Said.
"I'm a conservative." He placed
himsell on record as disagreeing
with the recent Supreme Court de-
cision on Texas' abortion law (that
ruling declared that state laws pro-

Much of the uperation’s success
is owed to a patent that Henry se-
cured on his type of print washer,
This washer simply performs more
eiiectively and more rapidly than
others. Although the washers are
expensive, excessive cost is elimi-
nated as the washers do not pass
through an intermediary, but may
only be acquired by direct mail

Sunday Drinking May Come

by John Wylie

(Des Momesy—lowans wanting a
drink on Sunday currently have to
go to another state to get it, be»
cause current Iowa law prohibits
the sale of alcoholic beverages and
beer on Sunday.

All this will change, however, iIa
bill recently introduced in the Iowa
Senate becomes law. The measure
would permit food establishments
which do 40 per cent or more 0i
their business in non-alcoholicpro-
ducts to obtain a special liquor lie
cense allowing Sunday sales of ii-
quor by the drink and beer,

One of the measure’s co-sponsors
in the Legislature, Senator Kathe
erine Shaw, told the 51:8 recently
that her main reason Ior sponsoring
the bill is economic.

"I represent a district near the
Illinois border. Iowans wanting a
drink with their dinner on Sunday
must cross the border to get it,
and many do. In addition, the Iowa
law makes it very difficult for Iowa
restaurants and clubs to compete
with their Illlnms counterparts,”
Senator Shaw introduced a similar
measure in the last session of the
Legislature, but it died without con-
sideration due to the strong personal
opposition of the Speaker of the
House.

However, the Senator is more con—
{ident about the bill's chances in
this session. She explained that, not
only is there a new Speaker oi the
House, but also that a freak oi the

eluding Saturday Review and Ms.
have expressed interest in publishr
ing a story on the East Street Gal—
lery. Their interest centers not so
much on the production aspect but
rather on the coroperalive style that
the operation currently uses and the
one envisaged to begin In six months.
At present, workers hold transitory
positions and those living in the
house share chores. Eventually,
Henry would like to add an adjoining
factory which might produce autoe
mated equipment.

Henry hopes to institute some un-
usual practices in his cooperative
setrup within six months These i ,
clude a labor credit system where
by desirable work pays less, Amount
at work will be based on personal
standards, and hours worked will be
ilexlble. He hopes to attractworkers
ol diverse backgrounds, ages, and
interests while he hopes that they
will make a long term commitment
to the enterprise, Henry projects
a total democracy and freedom oi
expression. This freedom of expres»
sion will extend to the Gallery’s
own printing presses which are ten-
tatively planned. Workers will be al-
lowed to use these presses for per
sonal expression, even producing
radical literature it they so desire.

In the near future he ioresees
a large market tor a print drier
that he has developed. Much of his
spare time is spent on future plan»
ning. As he talks, it sounds more
and more as though this highly suc-
cessiul businessman is planning a

Island line.

calendar has enhanced the mea-
sure’s chances of success.

“New Year’s Eve fell on a Sunday
this year, and there was a mass
exodus from Iowa to the Illinois
establishments, which were open as
usual that night This, I hope, will
help to locus attention on the bill."

Grinnell has live restaurants which
would oualiiy tor Sunday liquor lie
censes under the proposed measure.
Jerry Besson ot BJ’s told the Site
that they would definitely apply tor
the special license ii the bill be
comes law. Tom parmley, owner of
the Longhorn, said the matter would
require a good deal of consideration,
but that he would “almost certainly
have to apply for the licenseinorder
to reamin competitive".

Bob Globus, owner of JD’s, said
that he had just been released from
the hospital and had thereior not had
time to consider the measure. Mrs.
Ronald Clayton, assistant manager
oi the Grinnell pizza Hut told the
58:8 that a decision ot that nature
would have to be made at pizza
Hut's national Headquarters in Wi-
chita, Kansas.

A spokesman for Wayne’s Steak
House, the iiith Grinnell restaurant
which meets to per cent qualiiicae
tion, was unavailable for comment,
The proposed Grinnell College Pub
would not be eligible for a Sunday
license under its current plan.
Senator Shaw's measure (SI-47) is
currently assigned to the Senate
Commerce Committee.
