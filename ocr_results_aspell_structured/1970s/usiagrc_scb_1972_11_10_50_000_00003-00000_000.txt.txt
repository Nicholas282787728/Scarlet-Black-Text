iness meeting 72 hours runningand
a relaxed social atmosphere often
pervaded the ISPIRG State Board
weekend rctreat held at a 47H camp
in Luther, Iowa, November 475,

There was important work to be
accomplished, as the ISPIRG student
representatives chose priority
areas ior research during the next
six months, But an equal emphasis
was placed upon social interaction,
board members getting to know each
other as people, students and staii
relating as individuals.

New veices were heard as large
delegations from is schools ape
peared. ah awareness oi the need
tor student initiative and responsle
bilitv was evident as a number of
strong Student leaders assumed new
roles in the organization, A new
Executive Council was chosen; Pat
Huston, State Board Chalrperson,
relinquished the helm to becomethe
delegate at large to the Executive
Council; and Todd Friedlandel‘, re,
search Director, resigned.

Set to the task of defining re-
search priorities, students based
their decisions upon information and
suggestions presented by lowans
during a series of statewide public
hearings in September and October.
The priorities encompass (l) agri-
culture and rural lite, (2) govern
ment accountability and responsive
ness, (3) individual ireedoms and
rights, and (4) public health and
saiety.

is hoped that the leadership oi the

dents to monitor the activities oi

Ms. Wynn noted. “We continually
hear the iowa legislature labeled as
a ‘special interest’ body which lg»
nores the needs oi the general pub-
lic. But people seldom are given
any substantiation oi those charges
it the legislative process is to be
responsive to the needs oi the peo
ple, then the general public must be
provided with objective iniormation

tions within and the controlling me

Breakdowns oi speciiic goals and

include (i) the duality oi medical

The definition of projects, an oute

less tangible, but equally impor

SGA Calls For Faculty Reconsideration

by Mike Breed

The Joint Board took action on
many minor matters in a rambling
three-hour long-meeting Wednesday
night. Aiter reports from Anne and
John abut actions taken at the Trus-
tee’s meetings (reported elsewhere
in this journal) there was a short
but pointed discussion about the aims
and goals or student power on cam
pus.

The impetus for thediscussion was
the faculty's action this last week to
keep student-taculty committeel
meetings closed. This came after!
the Board had voted overwhelminge
ly last week to recommend that such
meetings be kept open. General une
happiness with the faculty's action
was expressed, but there was also
a undercurrent of dissatisfaction
with the attitude the tacuity has had
toward student input all year.

It was pointed out during the dis-
cussion that silice some at these
committees were ioint committees,
with students chosen by SGA Sitting
on them, that the Joint Board could
go ahead and set up its own alter-
native set oi guidelines ior commi .
tees to follow. It was finally dew
cided, however, to try to have the
faculty action reconsidered after
students have had a chance to talk
to their profs. Since the faculty ac,
tion abrogated a promise made to
CBS last spring, action is planned
by that organization also. The na-
ture oi its move was not announced.

it seems strange thatafter somanv
years at struggle by students to at-

tain a meaningiul Voice in college
governance that a change in atmose
phere would suddenly render us ree
latively powerless again. Thetaculty

seems to be oblivious of the fact
that the college should be an intel-
lectual community the nature oi
which should be determined by all
or its members. (Oi course, the lev-
91 of intellectual interaction here
outside of Classes, even between
fellow tncuity members, has become
nearly nonexistent.)

The longest portion ot the meet
ing was spent discussing where the
money from the SAGA fast will go.
SAGA each semester allows stile
dents to sign tip one evening a 56mm
ester to last. One at the dining halls
is then closed and El cents is given
to the beneiiting organization ior
each student who signs up not to eat
the meal. Several groups applied to
receive the money, including “Bread
not Bombs, CBS, the Peace Collec-
tive, AFSC, UNICEF, and CARE,
Alter a long discussion overthe Var-
ious alternatives and Ways of deale
ing with the money, a soeso split
between CBS and the Peace Collec-
tive was agreed Money to CBSwill
go directly into the Martin Luther
King scholarship iund, and money
to the Peace Collective Will help
pay their operating expenses and
support charities in when theypai»
ticipate.

The Board then voted to Send the
Treasurer's and Auditor‘s guide-
lines back to committee Paul Loti—
don, Chairman of the Finance Come
mittee, had been asked to resign

and did so, effective Nov. 8. Mi-
chele Conway, Auditor, has announe
ced her intention oi putting her own
guidelines proposed into effect with»
out the approval oi ttie Board. This
action is to he eiiective Sat, Nov.
11. The Board, however, passed a
statement directing her not to take
such an action. The status of the
Auditor, Treasurer, and Finance
Committee Chairman is up in the
air ior the present. Applications
are open for the office ofSGA Trea-
surer.

To add a lighter touch to the meet
ing, the Board voted to abolish the
lSrminute debate limitation which
they had passed Sept 18. Since this
limitation has been ignored since
its passage (or at least hasn't been
eiiective-4M SAGA last discussioll
lasted 4'7 1/2 minutes by Chairman
Pleller's count) this was a reason-
able action.
