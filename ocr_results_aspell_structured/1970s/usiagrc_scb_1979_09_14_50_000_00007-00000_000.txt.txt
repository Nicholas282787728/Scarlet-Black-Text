Rewarding rural escape

by Kate Hughes

This summer, i was involved in a
new experience working with under-
privileged children from inner New
York City. I worked as a camp
counselor for the Fresh Air Fund on
Sharpe Reservation in Fishkill, N.Y.
Most of my campers were lower class
blacks or Puerto Ricans lrom South
Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan,
or Staten Island. \

There are dozens of Fresh Air Fund
organizations throughout the country,
but the original Fresh Air Fund is
located on 43rd Street in downtown
Manhattan.

The Fund was started 102 years ago
with the Reverend William Parsons
and his Friendly Town Program. He
took a child from the city into his
parish in the country tor the summer.
Every suumer, the Fresh Air Fund
placed a child trom the city in a home
in the country.

in the 19405, a man named Sharpe
donated 1,000 acres of beautitul, r‘noun
tainous land to the Fund. Since that
time, Sharpe Reservation has grown
to 3,000 acres of land. There are two
boys’ camps, a girls' camp and an
unusual camp that mixes handicapped
with nonchandicapped
children. Two manmade lakes, a
planetarium, and a model farm are
also on the Reservation.

Approximately 2,500 children are
sent to the camps in Fishl-(ill for two
weeks at a time, While 11,000 Children
are placed in the Friendly Town Pro-
gram.

Beverly McEntarier, director of the
girls' camp, which is otricially called
Anita Bliss Coler or Camp ABC for
short, said, “These children have the
unique opportunity of spending a few
weeks of their summer in a very new
environment."

McEntarfer has been with the Fresh
Air Fund for nine consecutive years
and says there is somethin very
specia about seeing the ki s enjoy the
woods {or the ﬁrst time. McEntarl'er,
like myself, iound out about the Fresh
Air Fund in a summer employment
catalog while she was attending coir
lege in the Midwest. Asked why she
keeps coming back, she says that the
she simply enjoys camping, has
received continual promotions and,
more importantly, loves kids

During my last weeks at Camp
ABC, 1 interviewed several of my
campers who were nine and ten years
old, the youngest kids at Camp ABC.
Most of them said that they wanted to
stay in the city because they were use
ed to it and had a lot of friends there
They liked the quiet of the Country,
but because they weren’t use to the
bugs and the new surroundings, they
l.l wanted to go back to the city.

i talked to a Iew of the older
campers, 13 and 14 years old, and
more of them Said that they did want
to get away from the city. When asked
what they did in the city when they
were not going to school, all oi them
told me that they went to jams in the
park (jams are discos for children) or
played handball or coke-aring-a-lario
in the streets. In the country, they go
boating, sw1mming, and do arts and
crafts, which are all new activities to
them.

i became very close to one little
girl from Queens, New York, who told
me why she does not ieel comfortable
where she is living now and wants to
move to the country. There are two
men in her apartment building who
carry wine lll hugs and try to scare
her, She is afraid to live there because
of the winos who say
they’ll beat her up She likes the coun-
try because it looks dilierent;’the
trees, the grass. and the lake/are all
new to her.

Another feature of the Fresh Air
Fund is the diversitv of its staff
members. There were a number of
foreign counselors working at Camp
ABC, as well as at Hayden Marks. and
Pioneer, the boys' camps, About 30%
of the stall was lrom out of state. The
rest of the stalf was from New York
City; many of the counselors were
once Fresh Air Fund campers
themselves. I worked with a woman

from Panama who has been living in
Brooklyn tor several years.

I learned a great deal about children
and life in the city from a child‘s
perspective. It is an extremely deman-
ding job, one in which you have to be
totally committed 24 hours a day, but
the rewards are well worth it. To
teach a child a new skill, such as how
to row a boat, take a picture, or to
simply sit by the iishing cove and talk
after a long hike gives one a very
warm feeling as a little girl opens
up to your and becomes a child
once again.

These kids are no different from any
other kids except that they do not
have the opportunities to enjoy the
outdoors and get away from being a
“forced" adult,

I recommend this job to anyone who
is truly interested in working with
children who need a great deal of at-
tention but, in return, can teach you a
it); about yoursell and their way of

l e.

There are very few camps left of
this type. The children pay nothing
and the organization receives all oi
the money from private donations and
nothing from the government.

Please contact me. Kate Hughes,
ext, 253, if you have any questions
about the Fresh Air Fund or would be _
interested in working for them. I
guarantee that it will be a memorable
experience.
