Board back books

By a four to one margin. the
Grinnell School Board approved
Wed. night the Reconsideration
Committee recommendation that
the Godfather, Summer of oz, and
the Exorcist remain on the high
school library shelves.

Although the School Board’s
decision was the first deﬁnitive
action taken in the book banning
controversy that has been raging
since last fall, the war is far from
over

For one thing. the Recon-
sideration Committee, whose task
it is to decide whether all the books
in question are “appropriate {or
educational purposes," has yet to
decide on four other books which
are charged obscene and vulgar by
lay preacher, Ben See. Those
books, Soul On ice, Black White
Cuckoo's Nest. and Flowers For
Algernon will be considered at the
March 4 committee meeting.
March 4.

Following those recom~
mendations (no action, structure
books’ use, or remove from
shelves), the Committee must
consider charges on additional
books by several other people,
mainly Rev. James Turner.

Furthermore, the issue could
carry on still iurther depending on
the actions of Mr See.

He has recourse to an appeal to

the School Board or eventually
legal action, beginning with County
Attorney Don Schild. Although he
has not made any flat declarations,
all indications are that Mr. See is
far lrom ready to lay down his
righteous arms.

Over 20d people attended the
meeting forcing it to move {mm
the Board Offices to the Junior
High Auditorium across the street
Two other controverisal issues
were also on the evening’s agenda.
The board heard the state fire
marshalls report on the Junior
High which was just shy of a
condemnation and voted to sell
Cooper School, as it is also unsafe
for children.

But the main attraction was
deﬁnitely the book issue. lt
prompted claps ol feeling from
both sides of the question, but the
applause meter registered heavily
in favor oi See’s opponents.

The lone dissenter on the hoard,
Harold McCulloch, said the Board
should vote on the issue using the
same reasoning with which uley
had prohibited smoking during
school board meetings. Just as the
Board had banned smoking
because it was offensive to non
users without deciding who could
smoke and who couldn‘t, so the
board should remove those books

which are offensive to “non-
users.”

Metaphorical debate ensued as
to whether lilth, like smoke, does
indeed drift into one’s face.

See highlighted his arguments
with the results of What he belived
to be a valid cross~section oi the
community in which 80 per cent or
532 people supported his position.
See said he was surprised at the
Board’s decision and that they
were letting down 80 per cent at
their constituents

Undaunted, Mr. See commented
that those who approve of
“wallowing in this kind of
literature,” like everyone else.
“will one day have to answer to
God,” and that though this battle is
lost, “God never loses a war.”

KDIC
joins
Pacifica

The Grinnell College radio
station, KDIC, has become an
airiliate oi Pacifica, a program
service. According to KDIC
Program Director Steve l-lirtle,
Pacifica is a “fairly major net»
Work" with four stations across the
country. New York’s WBAI is a
Pacifica affiliate,

One ol the major aims of
Pacifica is to “explore causes at
Strife between individuals and
nations which plague mankind
with war,” Although the programs
generally deal with government,
economics, and politics, the sera
vice also offers a selection of radio
plays and music, Speciiic
programs produced by Pacifica
include shows about the activities
of the CIA. the underground
movement in the United States,
and the Attica issue. The service
also provides tapes of interviews
with authors who have written
books pertaining to subject matter
covered by Paciﬁca,

Two to four hours of Paciﬁca
presentations will be used this
semester on a trial basis.

While KDIC has set aside
Tuesday nights irom eight to nine
{or Pacifica programming, the
balance of Pacifica broadcasts will
be presented at random in the
afternoons and at night. “It looks
like there are going to he a lot of
exciting programs," says nirtle.

KDIC plans to produce programs
to submit to Faciiica for
distribution throughout the
country. The station's first en-
deavor will be a program about the
conference on American Culture to
be held on campus. Hirtle en-
courages groups on campus to
submit tapes.

The Pacifica service is being
paid for through the present Kch
budget, The cost of the service,
which is determined by the number
of programs used by the affiliate
each week, will be in the neigh-
borhood of $500 a year,

Dorm committee born

Another committee is born. This
one is the Resident Hall Im-
provements Committee, created
by Bob Jacobs. associate dean of
student affairs,

The committee will include the
director of the physical plant, Dale
Hawn; director of student ser
vices, Ralph Pomerank; an SGA
cabinet member; three students
chosen by SGA; a resident adr
vlser; and the chairperson,
Jacobs.

The function of the committee
will he to consider requests from
the community for students
initiated and executed hall im-
provements,to make recom-
mendations on such requests to the
Physical Plant, to Consult in the
implementation of approved
requests, and to work with the
Physical Plant on all campus
aesthetic improvement.

The committee can only
recommend that requests be
executed. it lacks power to ap-
prove requested improvement
projects. The physical plant
director will be responsible to the
committee for explaining the
impracticality of denied requests.
The physical plant is under a tacit
obligation to President Turner to
actuate the project it at all
ieasible, according to Jacobs,

Student painting of rooms, hall,
and lounges is virtually guaranr
teed, he stated, it done in a
“Supervised atmosphere" in order
to alleviate B StG's concerns about
proper use of- equipment and ap-
plication of paint, A small subs

committee of the committee will
hear petitions for painting to
hasten approval of such proposals.

Aesthetic lounge improvemenm
will be channeled to another
subcommittee which will confer
with the Physical Plant and the
particular hall involved on the
repair and betterment of lounges.

The Students on the committee
will be selected early next week by
SGA and the committee will con-
vene after Tuesday‘s general
meeting of the original dorm
renovation committee which
conducted last weeks‘ hall
meetings. SGA is accepting ap
plications until tomorrow for this
committee. The student members

will include a north campus
resident, a south campus resident,
and a resident from oficampus,
collegepwned housing.

The rationale for the invention of
the Committee is to help strengthen
hall and floor unity and to build
better student morale through
student involvement in im-
provements, According to Jacobs,
the committee can fulfill this by
providing a quick means of
decision~making on student
proposals. Numerous imr
provements can be accomplished
with minimal funds and the
combined labor of students and B
&G he maintained.
