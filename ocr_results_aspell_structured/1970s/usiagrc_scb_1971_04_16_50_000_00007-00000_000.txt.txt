Right to deny pay and acad-
emic credit to members of
the campus whoare on strike;‘
and the concomitant obligation
to accept legal strikes legally
conducted without recourse to
dismissal of participants.

All members of the campus
have a right to fair and equit‘
able procedures which shall
determine the validity of ch~
arges of violation of campus
regulations.

The procedures shall be st-
ructured so as to facilitate a
reliable determination of the
truth or falsity of charges, to
provide fundamental fairness
to the parties, and to be an
effective instrument for the
maintenance of order.

All members of the campus
have a right to know in ad—
vance the range of penalties
for violations of campus re-
gulations. Definition of ade-
quate cause for separation
from the campus should be
clearly formulated and made
public.

Charges of minor infractions
of regulations, penalized by
small fines or reprimands
which do not become part of
permanent records, may be
handled expeditiously by the
appropriate individual or co-
mmittee. Persons so penal-
ized have the right to appeal.

In the case of charges of in-
fractions of regulations which
may lead to notation in para
manent records, or to more
serious penalties, such as
suspension or expulsion,
members of the campus havea
right to formal procedures
with adequate due process,

‘ including the right of appeal“

Members of the campus elf“
arged or convicted of viola-
tions under general law may
be subject to campus sanctions
for the same condu‘ct, in ac-
cord with campus policies and
procedures, when the conduct
is in violation ofa campus rule
essential to the continuing
protection of Other members
of the mmpus or to the safe-
guarding of the educational
process.

‘ ~ In case of tatal or partial
closures due to strikes, we
suggest immediate cessation
of pay and academic credit
for those directly participat-
ing. The campus “should not
make claim to beLhe onlyarea '
of society where strikes are
costrfree to their partici‘
pants. Workers uniformly for-
go their pay as they withdraw
their services. They are sub
ject to the costs of strikes as
well as the potential benefits.
Persons on campus can hardly
expect the one and only "free
ride.“ A cost~free strike,also
is not an effective means of
demonstrating moral conviv
tion.
