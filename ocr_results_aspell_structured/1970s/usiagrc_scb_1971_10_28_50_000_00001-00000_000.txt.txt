China Admission 2

lo Ull Natural

David Hamilton, Visiting Professor
of History, told a capacity crowd in
the South Lounge Tuesday night that
he felt theonly surprise surrounding
the admission ofthe Peoples’ Repub-
lic of China into the United Nations
was the plourality in favoroithe Al-
banian resolution for China’s ad»
mission.

l-le regarded the decision to admit
Cllina and remove Taiwan a natural
outcome of the recent alteration of
American policy toward China.

Adam Malik, president ofthe United
Nations General Assembly, ex—
pressed this opinion when he said,
“If the United States has been willr
ing to come to terms with the mainr
land government at the expense ol
Waiwan, why shouldn’t other counr
tries also follow Suit”!H

Hamilton also saw China’s accepr
tahce as a move consistent with the
United Nations' Charter. Since the
question oi which of the two govern
ments should be seated in the UN
has centered around which is more
representative of the people of
China, Hamilton feels that Taiwan
has not been expelled, but instead
has lost the credentials of repre
senting China.

The speaker was relativelycertain
that China would accept the invitar
tion for membership without insists
ing on a reaffirmation of the prinr
ciples in a declaration which desig
nated Taiwan as an integral part of
China.

Students Discuss
Classroom System

A general discussion oieducational
and grading systemsal Grinnelltook
place Sunday atternoon from 4:00 to
5:00 in the South Lounge. About
thirty-five students attended the
meeting which was organized by
Carolyn Ashbaugh,

The discussion topics ranged from
the possibility of a no—grade or
credit/fall system to the lack of
academic exchange by students.
Carolyn Ashbaugh said, “i don't
think grades are the basic issue,"
and expressed the idea that funda-
mental problems lay in the basic
classroom learning situation. The
general consensus seemed tobethat
students are dissatisfied with their
Classes and this is due ln partto the
pressure ot the grading system and
in part due to the poor conditioning
and laziness of the students.

Recruiters
‘Dlsuppolnted’

Two recruiters for Vista and
the Peace Corps who were on
campus last week met with dis
appointingly few students, the
88th learned Tuesday.

According to Kathy Crow, one
of the recruiters, the turn—out
for last Tuesday night’s firm
about ACTION programs “wasn’t
one of our record-setters.
(there were) tour people, include
ing the projectlonlst 'l
And although Kathy and “Noosh”
Nishillara were here all day
Tuesday, apparently no students
(other than an stiB reporter)
went to see them at the new
Career Services office.

Kathy and Noosh left Grinneli
a day earlier than they had
planned last week, but they plan
to try again, possibly in the
near future.

Council Opens Records To

Watson fellowship Candidates, Dive
isional files on Executive Council
proceedings, and internal operations
ol the Council occupied the attention
ol the Executive Council in its Octor
ber 20 meeting.

The Council unanimously approved
the names of Meredith Dodge, Ed-
ward Hirsch. Norris Stubbs, and
Gregory Thielmanh as Grinneli Col-
lege’s candidates for the Watson
Fellowship,

Mr. Morris then madethe following
motion:

1. “That a the be established by
each or the Division Chairmen, open
to members of the faculty and any
others designated by the Executive
Council, in which will be placed:

A. All institutional research data
employed by the Council in the
decision making processexcept
that of a highly personal nature
(such as individual laculty sal—
aries).

B. All proposals concerning De
partment size, staffing require-
ments, and curriculum that are
being currently considered by
the council except mattersofin-
dividual laculty salary, tenure.
promotion, and contract renew-
ai.

, All proposals and iniormation
relating to the otherbusiness ol
the Council which do not involve
personnel matters.

2. The Council may, by a majority
vote, prohibit the inclusion at any
particular document in the laculty
tile or may include any document it
wishes therein which would other-
wise be excluded by one or more of
the provisions in paragraph 1
above,”

The motion was unanimously
passed by the Council, The new sys
tem replaces the previous rather
haphazard method oirecordkeeping,
which had no central nling system
other than the Secretary's minutes.
Some individual members of the
Council kept personal records olthe
Council’s proceedings, but these

were closed to any outside inspece
tion.

The Council tllenbeganadlscussion
of its own internal operations. The
primary focus wasthe means oipre-
sentlng administration proposals to
the Council. No final conclusionwas
reached, and the Secretary, Mr.
Parslow, was asked to draw up a
statement for the use of the Council
at its next meeting (which was held
yesterday).

The issue of faculty size iS still
pending, with requests from boththe
History and Russian Departments
still to be decided upon, in addition,
members of several departments
are taking one year sabbaticals, and
the C0unctl must decide whether to
replace them for that sabbatical, and
if so, whether for a half or a full
year term Dean Wall is hopefulthat

pied most of the Council's time for

Woman’s Movement Report

The Board will hold an open meeting
Sunday at 9:30 A.M. in BurlingViEWr
ing Room. President Leggett, Deans
Wall and Walker, and Shelley Floyd
will present reports to the Trustees.
This session will be primarily de-
signed to bring the Trustees up to
date on events on the Grinneli
Campus.

Shelley will present ideas of the
women’s movement on the Grinneli
Campus to the Board, Along with
Terry Clifford, she will discuss
women’s ieelings President Leg-
gett indicated that the four women
on the Board might propose speci-
fic recommendations on the wo»
men’s movement, especially as it
relates to Faculty hiring.

The final session of the Trustees,

an Executive Session, will begin at
1:30 Sunday afternoon. Four major
items are on the agenda: Report
of the Investment Committee, Re-
port ol the Committee on Trustees,
Approval of Acting Deanship, and
Approval ofBlaCk and Womenlaculty
resolutions.

Faculty Raises?

The report or the InvestmentCDm-
mittee will be purely hypothetical
since the details of the Phase TWO
Wage and Price Freeze have yet to
be announced, However, President
Leggett indicated some 0fthe issues
they would raise. ”if raises in
salary are permitted under Phase
Two Guidelines, a raise in faculty
Salaries at Grinneli will be virtual
necessity it laculty morale is to be
kept at a high level."

The President alsoindicatedthat no
such raise could come without a
raise in tuition. "A raise in tuition
is inevitable r if it is allowed(hythe
Commission on Wages and Prices)
it is merelyamatterotwhenahdhow
much,"

In addition to raising faculty saiv
aries, Leggett indicated that there
were severalothercriticalneedsthe
college will have to face in the next
year.

“We did without some things tor a
year that we simply cannot put off
for another year", Among these
Leggett included: Departmentsupply
budgets, which were sharply cur-
tailed ior the lollrmz academic
year; rennovation of wiring and
plumbing in classroom buildings;
needed work on college-owned
houses which are being converted
into student living quarters; and
maintaining the present student/
racully ratio of 122:].

Who Will Rule?

Since Dean of the College Joseph
Wall will be on sabbatical second
semester while holding a visiting
Professorship at Brown University,
it has been necessary for President
Leggett to appoint an Acting Dean
for that time period, Leggett will
also be absent from the Collegeuntil
February 20, meaning that Waldo
Walker, who will serve as Acting
Dean, will also be Acting President
of the College for a month. "We‘re
putting a lot on bean Walker ior
those months. However, lexpectDr.
Clotleiter will assist him a great
deal, especially on the Committee
work."

The final item on the agenda will
be Board Consideration of three
resolutions endorsing the actions of
the Executive Committee in the
areas of Black and Women’s re-
cruiting for Faculty positions.
