My President The Millionaire

by Jack Doppelt

Richard Nixon; president, corpor-
ate lawyer, and real estate holder,
has officially become a millionaire.

By reaching that golden milestone,
Mr. Nixon has fulfilled all three
of his life-long dreams. This ac,
hievement was harder to attain than
the Presidency, but easier than
marrying olt Julie and Tricia.

Reaching the million dollar pla-
teau was no mean task and Mr
Nixon can confidently say that he
did it all himself. The only two
giits he has ever accepted have
been Checkers and a kiss on the
cheek from Sammy Davis, Jr.

Mr. Nixon prides himself on self-
motivation and self-initiative. His
politics, from the work ethic to his
war on povertyrprugrains, reﬂects
his personal beliefs. He strongly
adheres to the scientific maxim,
“Nature Abhors a Vagrant.”

Just like baseball players who
remember the hit that broke the
record, the President will cherish
the transaction that put him over
the top. Mr. Nixon sold two lots
in Key Biscayne, Florida, realiz»
ing a gross profit of $96,900. Ir-
onically, the monumental deal which
jettisoned the President into the

Brevuy Finds large Audience

by Elaine Carey

Brevity, a magazine published we-
ekly, is appealing to more mem-
bers of the college community. st-
alled by six English majors, Bre-
vity, has been in existence torthree
semesters and has a circulation at
approximately 150.

Editor sherry Mayrent documented
the rise in popularityv of Brevity
on campus by stating that on the
average of five new Subscriptions
are received, weekly, The main si—
gnificance of Brevlfy was cited by
Ms. Mayrent in that “it separates
so much" as halt the subscriptions
are noannglish majors or profeSA
sors.

The enjoyment of writing and read-
ing Brevity, the creation or a sense
of intellectual community between

million dollar club where most ofhis
triends reside, occurred in Key
Biscayne, the home of friend and
member, Bebe Rehozo.

Disclosure of his financial states
ment is testimony to the view that
the event was particularly signifir
cant to the President, a man who
is not known for publicizing any
tinancial matters, personal or pol-
itical.

The Millionaire’s aides say that
irugal saving has accounted for most
of his increase in net worth since
residing in the White House. He is
also the first President to receive
a $200,000 a year emolument, twice
that of all Presidents since 1949.

Most friends claim that Mr. Nixon
could earn much more than that if
he were in private life. Most critics
are willing to take up the wager
if only for argument sake. Many
have contended that since Mr. Nir
xon has attained all three of his
lifetime goals, he might as well
retire and enjoy the fruits of his
successes.

With his savings, property and
United States Savings Bonds (Serr
ies E), Mr: Nixon could buy David
Eisenhower a dog and give his pole

outlet other than formal papers for
writing, and support ofdepartmental
communication are the goals set
forth by the staff.

Assisting Editor Mayrent are as
Sociate editors Martha Rosner, Sue
Steinwall, Jim Hubbard, and Mike
Breed. Barbara Swift is editor of
poetry.

The publication includes poetry,
essays that are serious or light,
reviews, and parodies, tor example
ion professors. This year, a main
type "of‘=11teraturc published in Bre-
vity'is'an epistilary novel which any»
one may add to the series. Other
projects slated for this year’s pub-
lications include puzzles, a series
dealing with women in literature,
magazine prose, and moral essays
based on the 18th century.

Anonymous articles are received
quite often which Ms. Mayrent con»
siders significant because Brevity
allows recognition of opinions in
print without names which has ob—
viously encouraged more spontan-
eous expression from people. A1~
though the staff desires the public
cation to result from spontaneity,
at least half of an issue is written
by the staff.

Woods: Romance And the Ego

To the Editors:

At this point I feel that all the
previous writers have missed the
boat. Ms. Peters and Ms. Hughes
came closest to an explanation of
this situation, but the scope of their
letter was too narrow to encompass
the problem. These ladies feel their
wants and needs frustrated by males
who are either too afraid and/or
too “independent" to give enough
to make a relationship work. Well,
my dears, I fear the situation is
the same on the other side of the
sexual line. Once on my second time
out with a girl, she told me that
we mustn’t see each other in this
manner again. We had gone to the
movies, When questioned why, she
responded that she didn’t want to
be tied down for the rest of her
College Career! The most fragile
part of the male, and I imagine also
in the female, is the ego. It is
treatment such as the above that
has made me leery of campus roe
mance. Ladies of that type make
the founding of a meaningful relat—
ionship a venture that could well
end in disaster. Slow boiling in oil
is the only punishment 1 can lmar
gine as more painful. The price of
failure makes one think twice.

There is a theory of history that
states that all changes in the cour-
se of life and history demand a
catalyst and that in the realm of

people, changes demand an icono—
clast, Not a talking iconoclast, at
doing iconoclast, The theory is cal-
led the Sheep Theory. it continues
that most people are slaves to con-
vention of some sort and will not
stray from their norm unless led
astray by someone who is doing the
same thing in a better way. imagine
you are in a crowded supermarket
and that there are two checkout coun-
ters. One has a long line and the
other none at all. Many people feel
more secure in the long line and
you come along and opt for the
short one. You will find yourself
followed by an unholy horde who
see the short line as better and
more secure because at your pree
cedent,

My box number is 1193. Anyone
iemale wishing a new iriendship
to develop with a rather decent
male, but are not alraid of it be-
coming more and/or losing your
individuality, please notify. I re-
peat, friendship. This is not an
all-Campus proposition. Treat it
as such and it simply will not work.
Yes, in my own bullheaded way i
am serious about this. Writing lets
ters and debating doesn’t do the
situation any good, but it is my
hope that one person moving into
the open will make others feel more
secure in following suit.

itical career that springboard that
David needs to catapult himself
into the nearest lake.

He could travel the world as he has
always wanted to do. Or take a var
cation in Massachusetts and get to
know how the other half lives,

He could just stay at home (which-
ever nne he so chooses) and watch
television, and then call the neighr
boring stations to complain about
the news programming.

He could help John Connally with
his campaign. And help him decide
on a party.

He could abolish his bronzed boots
straps.

And most importantly, he could
hohnob with Bebe and selected mil-
lionaire friends without feeling like
an out»of—place politician...now that
he’s one of the gang.

Orchestra

by Dave Crow
The Orchestra concert last week

had same ol the best playing this
reviewer has ever heard from that
body. Granted, it was not perfect,
but it nevertheless had a quality
of gusto about it; it was alive.
Three works were performed. Two
were “oldies but goodies”»—Pur-
cell’s Trumpet Voluntary and Sch-
ubert’s 8th, the “Unfinished” sym—
phony. One was a very interesting
piece by Zoltan Kodaly (yes, that
is the Kodaly of musical education
fame). It was the intermezzo to his
“Hal-y Janos" which I suspect most
of the audience, in company with your
reviewer, had not heard before.
The brass performed with distincs
tion and polish in the Purcell, most
especially the soloist, John Can-
field. This piece went quite well,
staying with the brass almost wholly
in tune and periorming with an in-
imitable vigor. It was perhaps the
best done pieceoi the evening. The
Kodaly was a Very delightful little

Legislative

by Fran Cutler

If Grinnellians are not willing to
change many of their ecologically
unsound habits, possibly they would
consider an alternate method of
purging their eco~conscience. Tho-
se with a strong attachment to
SAGA’S paper napkins may preter
to exhibit their concern for the
environment in a more political
manner. As residents oflowa, Grin-
nell students should take an active
role in supporting the passage of
important conservation proposals.
Recently, Iowa’s Conservation
Commission has made a farsighted
proposal to the lowa legislature,
calling for an Open Spaces Acquisi—
tion program with a iundmg of $1,
000,000 per year. Lands acquired
through this new program willcome
only from willing sellers and not
through condemnation. it appears
that this wise and moderate pro—
gram will protect lands which can
never be replaced. Once acquired,
lowa’s Wild and scenic areas will
never wear out or become obsoe
fete. As the years pass, they can
only grow in value to the public.
Although this proposal is clearly
in the best interest of Iowa, the
Legislature in its traditional reluc-
tance to appropriate money for con

Raises $726

by Ken Winokur

This years KDIC auction raised
3726 Saturday. Half of the money
will go to the Martin Luther King
Scholarship Fund. and half to KDIC.

The most expensive item auctioned
was a dinner for four at the Arm
alias with Professor and Mrs. Jo-
seph Wall. The dinner was bought
by Barry Huff for $52. An italian
dinner for eight, given by Mr. and
Mrs. William McKibben of the clas-
sics department, was sold for $50.

The auction, held in Darby Gym,
was run by auctioneer Dick Scars,
a Grinnell townperson. John Seeley,
manager of KDIC commented that he
was satisfied with the results Of the
auction. According to his estimates,
more people came this year
than last. He feels that this is quite
encouraging because many people
were in Iowa City at the Grateful
Dead concert.

rect, in that is playing fairly well
and exuberantly, one would not ex—
pect the flatness to creep in. per.

in the music. ,
Overall, the quality was impres-

sive, especially to anyone who has
been familiar with the Grinnell Col-
lege Orchestra for the past several
years. It has been Very mucha “free
form" organization, with a fluctua-
ting membership and a new con-
ductor every year. it has had a tra-
dition of anything but excellence.
While it has not yet attained to that
status, the achievements of Mr. John
McLeod, who is the orchestra’s
conductor as well as the Manhattan
Quartet’s 2nd violin, have been little
short of miraculous. It is must un—
fortunate therefore, that Mr. Mc—
Leod will not be returning to Grin—
nell next year. He will, it is cer~
tain, be as great an asset wherever
he does go as he has been to Grin-
nell. One can only hope he will have
a worthy successor'here.

ools, organizations and individuals
will participate in the celebration
of Earth Week ‘73 during the week
of April 9—15.

This year, the emphasis will be on
the urgent national need to conserve
our energy resources and to deter-
mine the best possible alternatives
to our current energy probelm. Fu-
thermore, an attempt will he made
to gain some perspective from Earth
Day 1970, up to the present - to see
where we have been, what our-cur-

Solve the problems which remain.
If Grinnellians begin quickly to we
ordinate specific programs, there
is no reason why the entire Grin-
nell community could not participate
in Earth week ‘73. This week pro-
vides the perfect opportunity for
paper napkin users to show that
they too, have an Eco—conscience.
Major focus will also be given to
the costebenefit factors involved in

a transition to a decent environ-
ment.

urinuefl’s annual Theatre Dance Group concert will be presented at
