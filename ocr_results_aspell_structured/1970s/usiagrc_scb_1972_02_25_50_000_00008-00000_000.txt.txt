Track Team Ends
Win Streak 0t 2

by Chris Madson

Well, the winning streak snapped
at two. In a meet that came right
down to the last two events before it
was finally decided, the Wartburg
Trotters proved too powerful for the
Grinnell squad to handle.

There were the usual bright spots
for Grinnell. Chuck mounted another
assault on the iorty~year old Grin-
nell two-mile record (it was set in
1922, before we realized we weren't
jocks) and drew away from the ﬁeld
to finish in a strong 9:335. Uniore
tunately, the old record Stayed out
in front, too, and is still alive and
well on the rickety record board on
the east wall of the P.E. complex.
9:225, Pilbrow’s old record, is
still a mighty respectable time, Just
ask Chuck,

Dave Wright picked up his third
consecutive double win, taking the
long jump with a 19111.1/2” and
the triple jump with a 40’4”. It was
a good thing Dave was there to help
preserve the reputation of the Grin-
nell field event men. Usually one of
the strongest units on the team, the
rield men took a whipping at the hands
of various visiting athletes, Barry
Hun, a victim or the recent plague,
did not compete so Grinnell's shot-
put efforts were severely hampered,
and Jim Pirolli’s absence in the high
jump was also keenly felt. Chris
Madson vaulted but had to settle for
second in the face of 3 13'6" Wart-
burg jump,

The runners did well. Jon Gray won
the intermediate hurdles (again), and
John Hesshurg ran a smooth 1000
yards to break the tape. Phil Morales
doubled in the 440 and the halfemile,
pulling away with nailing, devasta-
ting sprints in the last hundred yards
in typical Morales fashion. The other
point getters for Grinnell were Dan
Hildebrand who ran third in the mile
and iourth in the two-mile, Steve
Shroeder. third in the 660 yard run,
and Terry Seeoerger who finished
fourth in the 580.

The chagrined but resolute group,
the Grinnell Striders face another
tough meet this Friday, February
25, against Coe College and other
assorted opponents, in the P. E.
Complex. The question that I'm sure
is pulsing in all your minds is: "Can
the runners come back after such a
stunning blow to their morale?”
The only way to find out for sure is
to drop in about four o’clock and
find out...or wait for another bril—
liant analysis at times, distances,
and heights in next week's column.

90-79 Revenge On Cornell

by Curt Correll

There was a discernihle note of
amazement in the unidentified home
court fan's voice as he commented,
“These guys really look tough.“
And they were Pioneers 90 e
Cornell 79.

And there was a discernible note
oi amazement in the unidentified
varsity basketball player’s voice as
he commented. ”Where did they ime
port this Crowd, the Big Ten?” They
must have. When in recent history

Bob Burnett puts up a shot over a couple or
Cornell defenders last Saturday, scoring two or

and [n

his 32 points for the game.

He has now Scored

over 1,000 points in his career here.

MATM EN MORALVICTORY

by Sigi Ma Offenbach

Although the Grinnell wrestlers
were easily defeated by the Loras
matmen, the match was replete with
moral victories. Being the last home
meet of the season, our valiantgrape
piers gave the large contingent or
rootel‘s a lot to cheer about. Grin-
nell garnered two victories, which is
a record for a home meet this sea~
son, and collected six points, which
ties a record. The battlers from
Loras only pinned two Grinnellians,
and this is another record for this
season's home meets, Even though
the score was a lopsided 37 to e in
Loras’ ravor, it was definitely an
interesting, if not exciting, meet.

The meet started with Rick Night-
ingale’s match at 118 pounds. With
feline celerity Rick’s opponent
almost pinned him twice and racked
a score of [E to nothing Our next
wrestler, Butch Gates, one of our
newcomers, got pinned in less than
two minutes Now Butch knows What

it is like to be a wrestler. Then
Arnie Peters, a newcomer at lin-
pounds, fought ardently but was
pinned in the last period.

The 1513 pound match pitted two
wrestlers who seemed iairly equal
in Skill and strength. Our own Bob
Donelan proved to be the victor,
eklrig out a 4 to Z decision. John
Pursell also had an entertaining
match at 1’77 pounds. Although he
fought with agility and power, he lost
5 to l,

The return or Washington Alston
at 190 pounds provided most or the
pyrotechnics tor the evening.
The score was a lopsided 14 to 7,
and we sure are glad to see Washe
ington hack on the mat tor the PICA
neers. Again Lee Gleysteen’s match
at heavyeweigltt pitted our195 pound
man against another lowa Fats. After
almost pinning his obese opponent,
Lee finally succumbed to the pin
(or should 1 say the other guy
squashed him.)

~11 was a crucial win ior us," said
Coach Ray Boyd “in addition to
avenging our worst dcicat oi the
season (a 70744 thrashing delivered
hy Cornell in January), it gave us a
good opportunity to move up in the
standings."

Grinncll bolstered its season
record in conrcrcnce play to 440,
and although the pioneers still trail
in ninth place, they remain but one
game out or sixth.

A special feature attraction ofSate
urday's contest was Bob Burnett's
attainment of 1,000 - plus career
points. Scoring 32 against Cornell,
Burnett raised his college total to
1,031, making him the ritth entrant
to Grinnell's 1,000 point club.

The Pioneers embark on the tiual

Swimmers Victorious(Again)

Tomorrow - Cornell. Next week
- the Midwest Conference And
if last weekend was any indication,
the swimming Pioneers should
emerge as the top team in the
league,

in the final home meet 0f the year
last Saturday, the Grinnellians
drowned highly regarded Carleton
and Coe by scores or 82-31 and
72-41 and blasted St. Olai 88725.

The three victories rail the Scarlet
and Black’s dual meet victory string
to 24, and unless they are upset hy
Cornell tomorrow, are Virtuallyase
sured oi recapturing ”Dilly the
Duck,” awarded to the team with the
best dual meet record of the year.

Last Saturday's meet saw several
outstanding pertnrmances by Grim
nell athletes

The top exhibition was given by
Steve Ward who set a new pool
record of 23.1 in the 50 freestyle,
Ward also took a second in the 100
freestyle,

Tom Rownt was also impressive,
winning the 200 individual medley
and the 200 butterfly. Larry Huntoon
and Pete Bernstein shared the (lin

Grunt . . ,

mg honors with Larry taking the
required segment and Pete winning
the optional dives

Bob Winters took two seconds,
while Mike Daley took seconds in
both the 200 and 500 freestyle.

The Conference hopes of the Pioe
neel's seem to rest on two trips of
swimmer-s Senior captains Mike
Daley, Jim Cams, and Steve Ward
are all capable of winning or finish-
ing high in their events, But they
alone Couldn't win conferencei

All season long, the Grinnell vicA
tories have heen won on the points
of three freshmen, Tom Rowat, Bob
winters and Pete Bernstein All have
been Consistent winners and should
by now have the confidence needed to
excel even under conference
pressure. Relatively untested com-
pared to the seniors, there is, how-
ever, nc reason to doubt that they
won’t continue to do as well,
