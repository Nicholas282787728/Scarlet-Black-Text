Sometime between the weekend
before finals week and May 15, 1979, a
RodgersVGretch combined drumset,
valued at between fifteen hundred and
two thousand dollars, was stolen from
the Fine Arts Building's Room 106. It
belonged to me and Gary Michaud.
Even though i feel incredible grief, i
realize it is impossible not to get com»

June letter, sent in reply to my letters

Discophobes unite against

To the editor: In the August 31 issue
of the S & 13 Mr. DJL, Blatt opened
his argument in the detense of disco
music with the question. “Will they
ever leave us alone?" He was referr-
ing to what he regards as a current
wave of protest against disco music.
This is absurd. As a discophile, i must
in turn redirect this question.

Disco music and all the manisl‘esta»
tions of the disco industry pervade in-
evitable. it is disgusting, One can no
longer go out in public without hearing
a blast of ”Freak Out” or ”Join the
Navy.” Even on remote beaches there
seems always to be one disco fanatic
who carries with him some sort of por-
table machine which blasts out the
mindless tempo of disco. I hate it.
Holding my ears from this frenzied.
ratrtat-tat, I am only left to ask, ”Will
they ever leave us alone?”

As I hear it, disco is noise pollution.
It is unrelenting and abusive. As for
the ingrate on the beach, there is little
alternative but to bear with him until
he picks himself up, puts on his nylon
disco shirt. and goes home. I only wish
that the whole disco fad would follow
the same process, Go home (wherever
that is).

I could write on and on about how
vile the disco culture is. However, I
feel personally insulted, because the
Village People do not appeal to me,
Mr. Blatt has said that I am “asexual
and a forlorn deviant from the
mainstream of human existence.”

This is, of course, very rude of Mr.
Blatt. it is, i suspect, the character of
a discophile. But in his article, Mr.
Blatt has gone even further in his ex-
planation of what he calls “the cone
nection between disco and sex.” He
says “the disco beat is merely an ex-
tension of the elemental rhythms of
the universe,” He goes on to say that
“if it were not for the disco pelvic
thrust, life as we know it would not ex-
ist.” ‘

of inquiry on the matter, came from
Mr. Fudge, clearly stating that the
college cannot “assume responsibility
for the personal property of students
or staii.”

My concern now is to inform you,
the arts performer, You have come
here to Grinnell with your instruments,
in order to obtain cultural livelihood,
as well as to contribute to a variety of
social and musical events that help
personiiy Grinnell as the small liberal
arts college that it is. If you have an
instrument at Grinnell, think about the
consequences of losing it here,
because it is a reality.

I strongly urge you to take out some
kind of personal insurance and/or talk
to the administration about the
possibility of providing some type of
school or student coverage.

Secondly, I urge you to pay close at-

This is an interesting observation. I
must point out, however, that no mat-
ter how intense his admiration for the
Village People, between them, him,
and “the disco pelvic thrust," the
perpetuation oi life as we know it, will
never exist. Regretfully yours, Rob

To the editor: David Elatt has ap'
parently been reading too many
paperback psychology books. Accorr
ding to his recent article on
”disConhobia,” a dislike for disco
music is indicative of deeprseated sex—
ual hang-ups.- Better yet, he suggests
that discophobia is the province of the
sexually impotent. Hmm. A large
percentage of my parents’ generation
hate disco. ii David is right,
then ha of us must have gotten here
by artificial insemination.

Okay, so maybe disco does appeal to
our normal, sexual instincts, So does
pornography, yet i would hesitate to
assert that all those who avoid reading
Hustler are “asexual, forlorn deviants
from the mainstream of human ex-
istence."

As a matter of fact, I would balk at
most of the statements in this
preposterous article. Particularly
outrageous is Blatt’s premise that, as
disco is the only form of music with
cross-cultural appeal, _“only a firm
believer in Aryan racialpurity could
object to it." _ ' g ,

Does Blatt actually equate a distaste
for the stridency and repetitive beat
often found in disco with racist per-
suasions? Come onl

Such sweeping generalizations sound
mighty peculiar, especially when con-
trasted to Blatt's praise of the
”open minded” discophile. How dare
he call for a liverand-letrlive attitude
toward disco, and then disparage
other genres as ”bland and outdated”

To the edito - David, you ignorant
slut. To begin with. discophobia means
fear of disco. I do not fear disco; I
simply detest it with every fiber of my
being, as do the other innocents you so
unjustly vilified in your recent article.

We disco-despisers are not
“latter-day Puritans," bigols, or impor
tent wonders; we are merely or-
dinary, run—of-the-rnill music-lovers
who differ from discophiles in only one
major respect: we have taste.

I shall refrain from such sweeping
generalizations as: “Discorlovers are
exhibitionists (a sexual problem as
grave as the alleged impotence you
imparted to us) ;” why stoop to your ,
level? .

I shall, however, point out that ,

regardless of who Glenn Hughes is, he
has neither the evidence nor the
authority to state categorically that
“the Village People appeal to anybody
sexual." Such a statement is clearly
fallacious and merely serves to
underscore the weakness of your
argument—if such a pack of
outrageous misstatements can be
deemed worthy of the title
“argument,"iwhich I personally‘find
highly doubtful.

Fantasy, perhaps, Argument? Hard-.
ly. Arguments should be rooted in and
supported by logic, riot unsubstan-
tiated assertions such as,‘ “Discophobia
is rooted in...bigotry and/or sexual im—
potent." You’ll certainly never can ,
Vince me that disco is wormy or my
ears; you have, in fact, motivated‘me
to rush out with all due haste and buy
a “Disco Sucks” t-shirt, Susan K.
