These three young men just made the
discoveryof a lifetime.The oldest is 34.

Remember when h young men eould get uhe‘id in busi-
ness simply by growing old? it was n good s stem for
those with a little talent (Ind II lot of patience, but today's
technology moves too inst to wait for seniorit'

At Kodak. our extensive involvement in In e resenreli
hns made the need for fresh, young thinking more pi -
ing than ever. So we hire the best new talent we possibly
can. Then we do both of us a fever by turning them loose
on real problems, and giving them the freedom and re
sponsiliility they need to solve them.

That's how three Kodak scientists in their early tliil'e
