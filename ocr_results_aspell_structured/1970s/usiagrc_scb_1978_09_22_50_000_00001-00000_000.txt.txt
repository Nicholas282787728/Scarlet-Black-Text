Sinking dollar bits japan program

by All“? lion-land

The falling dollar almost resultr
ed in an unexpected early return
[or 39 students, representing
various colleges, studying oit
campus this year in Japan,

Two students from Grinnell are
currently in Japan participating in
the program sponsored by the
Associated Colleges of the Midwest
and in conjunction with the
Great Lakes College Association.
The program. centered at vt‘aseda
University in Tokyo, consists of
courses in Japanese culture and
language and includes living with a
Japanese family for the duration of
the stay.

THE 40 PER CENT drop in the
value of the dollar on the Japanese
market over the past 15 months
aroused speculation that the
colleges might have to shut down
the program immediately. Accord
ing to Roger Koester, the director
oi oil-campus study at
Grinnell, the ACM faces about a
350,000 deficit this year as opposed
to only about an $8,000 deiicrt in
previous years.

Because of the extreme decline
iii the value of the dollarifrom 300
yen per dollar last year to 130 a few
months ago and its present stan-
ding oi only about iiitpCharies
Cleaver. professor of English and
American Studies and head of the
Japan program here. says that the
colleges are “trying to tind money
irom other sources ior this year "
He maintains that the thought of
calling students home emerged
solely because “when we worked
out the budget last year, we
couldn't have predicted such a
dramatic drop in the dollar."

LAST THURSDAY and Friday
Cleaver traveled to Earlham
College in indiana to meet with
other educators about the
dilemma, “We couldn't just call
the students home because tvc'd
already made a contract with
them." Cleaver says, Instead, the
group worked out a rCVised plan
for the coming yc'

“We'd like to stay th Waseda,"
Cleaver asserts. “because they
hold a high reputation among the
Japanese, employ experienced
Engtis speaking teachers and
have worked with the program tor
15 years." lie goes on to say that
Waseda seems favorable to the
suggestion that the university
contribute more iinancialiy than
it has in the past

THIS YEAR. 'rIlE program dir~ '
ectors are asking Waseda to remit ,

the students’ tuition tor the spring

 

term, allowing students to
Continue their studies at the
university. The rebate would ac~

’crue to the ACM program.

According to Cleaver, Japanese
students in America havc
benefited from tuition remittances
for many years as a gesture of
“good Will" on the part of the U,S
Now that the economic tables have
turned. Japan is being asked to
reciprocate

FOR NEXT \F R; the admins
tors plan to implement cost cutting
measures. The program will last
{or only eight and one half months
as opposed to the current i2
months, Students will have the op»
tion oi remaining in Japan tor
another three months on their own.

“Students can make money
teaching English.and in fact most
do get jobs sometime during the
year.” Cleaver points out. “It's not
uncommon for a Student to earn
ten dollars or more per hour." He
notes that the jobs range irom
instructing business executives to
tutoring individuals or informal
small groups,

ALONG WITH Till-1 reduction of
time spent in Japan. the cost will
also rise from around $5,500 to
about $6.500, The ligure Still covers
the cost of tuition room, boardv
and transportation to Japan Stu-
dents participating will still
receive the full 32 credits. “We'll
ju: have to Work them a little
haider." shrugs Cleaver,

In the event that the dollar Slides

the directors of ACM and GLCA
designed another program. in

 

dependent ol Waseda. Under the
alternative, Students would attend
college in a smaller city such as
Hiroshima or Sendai.

lil.0i\(; wt'l‘ll 'l’llr} change.
Cleaver indicates that course ole
ierings would narrow somewhat
and the culturally heneiiciai
family living In the current
program would probably be out at
the question,

Paul Miglini'nto.4 senior who
participated in the Japan program
last year, expresses shock over the
possible program cut. “The ex
perience is so valuable that it's
impossible to summarize it in only
a few sentences." he declares, He
also comments that it is uiir
lortunate that the amount of tilne
spent on the island would be
lessened. but. that it would not be
extremely hard tor students to
complete courses.

On European markets the
dollar continues to lose value, but
at a much slower pace and otten
the trend stops or reverses itseli
tor short periods its tar as
other offrcampus programs.
Koester assures that the declining
dollar will not radically affect their
extstence or curricula. The prices
[or some of the programs will
probably go up. depending on their
locale. but otherWlse he notes.
"We're Still in fairly good shape."
Healso states that at no time would
a program be completely
discontinued it it were at all possts
ble to set up an alternative. or to
hook up with one ottcred at another
School.
