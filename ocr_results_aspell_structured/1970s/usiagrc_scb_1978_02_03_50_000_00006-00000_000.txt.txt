Fantasy festival ﬂicks:
two cbeapies, one biggie

by Nancy Carpenter

Do you sense some clever
psychological manipulation in the
arrangement of recent week’s
movies? Someone out there seems
to think d'lat the pump can be
primed by scheduling what we
refer to politely as “econo-ﬂicks"
all week, leading up to a Big Exc
pensive Movie, which will un»
doubtedly look all the bigger by
comparison. As Ms. Poppins would
say, “Just a spoonful of sugar
helps the medicine go down." Even
so, it would take a terrific amount
of Sugar to make The Lion in
Winter look less Silly or Sound less
ludicrous

The film purports to deal with a
historical theme, an episode
between Henry H and Eleanor of
Aquitaine that takes place in the
winter of 1133. It doesn’t pretend to
be factual; director Anthony
Harvey called it his “in-
terpretation” of the times,
Katherine Hepburn and Peter
O‘Toole play the middle-aged

than his cumulative average,

Doernhoefer realized in
retrospect that he “worked harder
than needed. I didn't give the
assistants enough of their own
room or responsibility.”

Natker feels that she will be able
to cope with the time problem by
acting on that same idea. She is
considering dividing one or both of
the assistant positions into two,
creating a few more levels. Rudov
is planning on contacting people
who have shown interest in SGA,
such as unsuccessful candidates
for hall represenmtive, to do the
volunteer work which would be
helplul in lightening the burden.

SHERlNIAN FEELS that a
“professional" is needed. “I would
go so far as to suggest that the top
three cabinet members take

- academic leaves of absences, so
that their only responsibility would
be to SGA.” He felt this should be
an issue in the upcoming officer
elections, His reasoning was based
on his view of SGA effectiveness.
“If you take SGA as a whole, the
impact within the last semester
has been very insubstantial."

Doernhoefer, who was an
assistant last year and a volunteer
his freshman year, has many
suggestions for improving the
office. He strongly believes that
two student coordinators with two
assistants each are needed to
accomodate the expanding office.
He felt this would offset the
problem of “just getting out of one
major project, like the blood drive,
and then finding you must start
preparation for another, such as
the shuttle buses." Staggering the
two coordinator‘s terms, so that
one is able to benefit from an unr
salaried apprenticeship in the
office, he feels, would make the
office much more effective,

sparring partners, who fight
constantly and viciously, then
realize that they really do love one
another.

The sets are majestic, the
costumes are pretty, but William
Goldman's script is a shmaltzy
bore. Look forward to lines like
”The year is 1183 and we are all
barbarians," “Dear, dear, what
shall we do with Mothert,” and
“Have you found a way to sell
everybody?" “Not yet, Mummy,
but I’m working on it." Critic
Arthur Schlesinger pointed out that
the Word “motivated” was
probably not bandied about in 12th
century conversation quite so
often.

The two cheap (and interesting)
films from the Fantasy Festival
that will still by playing this
weekend are Ivanhoe and A
Connecticut Yankee in King Ar-
thur’s Court. Ivanhoe, with Robert
Taylor, Elizabeth Taylor, and Joan
Fontaine, is the wellrknown tale of
chivalry and court intrigue, in

which the Normans and the Saxons
struggle for power and Ivanhoe
fights to ransom Richard the Lions
Hearted. There are low of ﬂashy
knights and blushing ladies in the
old MGM style. A Connecticut
Yankee, based loosely on Mark
'Nain's classic, is equally ex-
citing. lt's so bad, it’s good.
Crooner Bing Crosby is a Yankee
lad who gets a bump on the head
and wakes up in 16th century
Camelot, As the publicity release
says, “he introduces the knights to
such modern conveniences as the
wink, the safety pin, and the lariat,
which adds a new dimension to
jousting tournaments,” Bing sings
“Busy Doing Nothing” and other
BurkerVan Heusen tunes.

The first film of the Film Nuir
series will be shown tonight. Out of
the Fast. with Robert MitchUm,
Rhonda Fleming, Kirk Douglas, is
concerned with crime, deceit,
corruption, two-faced viciousness,
infidelity, and duplicity, Have a
fun evening.
