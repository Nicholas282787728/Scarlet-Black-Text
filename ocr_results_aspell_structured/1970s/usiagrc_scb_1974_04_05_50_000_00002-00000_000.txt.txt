by John Wylie

William Gannon. candidate for
the Democratic gubenatorial nomr
ination, used a Tuesday visit to
Grinnell to level a blast at the
Director of the Iowa Crime Coma
mission. l

Speaking to a group oi about 20
students in South Lounge, Gannon
called Iowa Crime Commission
Director George Orr ”incomper
tent" and said he should be
removed from his post.

Asked to comment on a publir
shed report that Iowa law oiiicers
would need $10 million,worth of
radio equipment to coniorm with a
state law enforcement communion
tions network oi which Orr is the
principal architect, Gannon replied
with the blast at Orr. .

”Get rid of George Orr. He's
demonstrated his imcompetence.,
He's in the public trough as deep
as anyone could get,".he said. He
added that. Orr is a retired mili~
tary oilicer on a pension, and
that Orr should be removed so
“that yob (could go) to someone
who's competent.“

Gannon described the Iowa Cris
me Commission as an example at
the Iowa Legislature “appropriat-
ing Iunds blindly without knowing
what they are buying."

One legislative function should be
to watchdog the executive branch
oi government, he said. II the
Legislasture does not do this, he
continued, as governor he would
have a watchdog agency “ior’ our
own information."

‘I Can Win'

Asked if could defeat Governor
Robert Ray, Gannon indicated
emphatically that he could.

Iteierring to Ray's six years in
olﬁce. Gannon said many voters
had told him they were ready for
u change. “Ray's bureaucracy is as
good as it can get. He's appointed
everyone he can appoint. It’s time
tor a change."

Although Gannon said his first.
task will be winning the Demon
cratic primary, he never menti.
oned any of his opponents by
name. «

He is one of four contenders for
the Democratic spot on the Nov-
ember ballot. Other candidates are
Clark Rasmussen,‘ former admin-
istrative assistant to Senator Har-
old Hughes (DrIAJ, James Schn-
beh. minority leader oi the Iowa
Senate, and James Crawford. a
late contender for the nomination.

Monopoly

Gannon expressed concern over
what he called "conception to
consumption" control of food prr
oduction by some large corpora-
tions.
- He said the way to prevent'such
“integrated, vertical control" is

antitrust action on the state
level.

Other points made by Gannon
during his visit:

*A moratorium On construction of
nuclear power facilities in Iowa
would be‘of little value, since
there are already plants in op
eration both in Iowa and in
neighboring states,

*Iowa's penal system needs to

become more rehabilitation ori-

ented.

"Strip mining should he auowed

insure that mined llnd c be
restored to its original condi ion.
*Iowa needs a land use policy
that favors small industry for
small towns and minimum gr-
owth for urban areas. But the
policy should be conceived and
enforced by local elected ofﬁcials.
‘A Gannon administration would
hold public oilice hours ior cit-
izens both in Des Moines And in
county coururouses.
‘Discriminatlon against homosex-
uals should end.
