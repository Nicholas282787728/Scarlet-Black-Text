tended by the composer," said
King. it is with this perr
soniilcation oi chamber music
that the Trio hopes to make its
appeal to all audience As
King stated. “Classic music
can be a big turnoii it not
presented well. The physical
motion comes from understanr
ding the music We are not
conscious of our gestures "
Classical music is not the ex
tent of the Mirecourt concerts:
jazz, ragtime, and most any
type oi music are included in

eplember M, 1979

their boasted “total reper-
toire.”

They have gone through
almost all the trio literature on
record and are especially fond
of periorming world pre-
mieres. Having done premiere
periormances oi music written
in the 18405 and Y505, the Trio
likes to do at least one
premiere every year. An ad in
Composer‘s Journal exr
pressing their desire to per
iorm premieres keeps them
supplied with fresh material.

Before coming to Grinnell,
the three musicians were
together on the teaching facul-
ty of California State Universir
ty at Fullerton, One night in
1973, they discovered a mutual
“burning desire to form a
piano trio." For two years, they
remained full time teachers at
Fullerton while at the same
time practicing (usually not
until 10:00 at night), perform-
ing, and establishing
themselves as a trio.

As individuals. they were do-
ing movie soundtrack \vnrk,
commercials, and various
other periorming tasks. Then
in was, while on their way to
New York for a Carnegie Hall
debut, they stopped in Girnnell
to audition, and soon
thereafter replaced the
Manhattan String Quartet as
the College’s resident musi-
Cians.

Now, with a much more flex-

, ible schedule than that afford»
‘ ed by the California school, the

Trio enjoys interaction with
students outside the classroom
as well as in. Later this year,
they plan to perform an are
rangement with Tim Poison
and Blair Martin, two student
musicians. They indulge In
what Jensen describes as
“luxurious practice time,” and
have ample opportunities to
promote the appreciation oi
their music.

Goals of the Trio for musical
development at Grinnell in
clude their wish to see SGA
concert iunds more evenly
distributed among a variety of
types or music, such as Jazz
and folk, including bluegrass.

They would also like to see
more oi an exchange between
the students and the per
iormers brought to campus. it
was suggested that performers
