ity to hear a fuller exposition or
those views at a meeting or all can-

Jared Gottlieh

Historically student governments
are characterized by a great deal of
idealism. Some people try to start
from scratch in their quest for imr
provement; successtul student goVr
ernments use the values or the past
to build tor the future The elliciency
at an organization results from steae
dy changes, not abrupt transitions.

Indeed I believe SGA should be com-
mitted to a policy at responding to
student demands, but SGA should not
seek changes ior changes' sake. A
moderate progressive government,
not radical chaos.

Each candidate must present pie
in the sky; here are some of mine:

(1) Yet another restructuring oi
the grading system, to allow credit
grading to serve students who would
entirely iorego grades and to serve
students who wish to take a course
without fear in a iield outside their
abilities; but the present use oI
credit-fail to artificially raise GPAS
must end.

(2) To iorce a reevaluation oi the
present extra tuition charges.

(a) To establish a regular system
oi iunding campus cultural minority
groups and to re-estahllsh the Initias
tive Fund as a support oispontaneous
student interests,

(4) To assure an end to petty stu-
dent tyrants who control and sche-
dule social activities Activities
chairpersons are coordinators; thcy
coordinate Student wishes and ideas,
not their own. Just one or two (less
pots significantly affect the Seoul
climate at this college.

(5) To get more student participa-
tion in the administrative process
of Grinnell, There is student power
available when students are willing
to treat administrators as persons,
not ‘them'

Chris Freeberg

in my experience with the All—
College EPC, I’ve found more stu—
dent opinion is needed, House Presi-
dents should survey their students
and report these views on academic
matters at the SGA meetings.
There may be no answer to the so
cial situations but we must flow to—
gerher as a student body on all
issues, especially those concerning
particular members at that hotly.
The Student Coordinator should be

elected. He controls more student
money than any other single student,
and should report to board meetings,
for more publicity, and because he
can virtually control our entertainr
ment.

A stlldent coalition should be
tormed among the students oi the
ACM colleges. It would enable easier
communication oi common research
projects, be easier to secure stu—
dent research grants, etc.

We can make valuable input into
the iaculty on academic concerns
such as team teaching, independent
study, opinions in the case of tar
inlnations, is Mr. Nasser, etc.

i welcome at any time comment on
these or any other topics that cone
earn you.

Mary Jane Wynn

a good deal oi Grinnell's formal
education .. social structure -- is
gone. What's lett? .. lots at things
to be reconstructed within a new
understanding ot liberal arts.

I am running for SGA President
because I believe i have the energy,
persistence, perceptions. organiza-
tlonal ability, and ideas necessary to
help guide us to redeiine our educar
tional and social situation Cries of
trustration and boredom indicate a
need ior mobilization oi intellectual,
emotional and creative resources.
(I would like to till the role at a
catalyst in such a mobilization.)

Immediate action in the inllowing
was are means to bridge the gap

Students Pass Meyer Proposal

. by Steve Nunn

A tour hour meeting in the South
Lounge Tuesday night ended With an
agreement by the Philosophy depart,
ment's EPC to reconsider the con,
tract oi Alan Nasser, and with the
adoption {or presentation to the 13C,
ulty ot a proposal dratted by the
Student Coordinator’s office and
amended by those present.

The proposal calls for a more for-
malized and significant structure for
student input into educational policy
matters below the Executive Council
level, A friendly amendment added
during the meeting rests the final
say on these matters with the ma-
jors and the iaculty oithe department
concerned.

The meeting was originally going to
be an informational session for stur
dents interested in the details of
Nasser's recontracting, However on
Monday night a group oistudents met
together and iormulated these de
mands: 1) student voting represen-
tation on the Executive Council,
2) equal Faculty—student represen-
tation on the departmental EPC
level, and 3) that Nasser be rehired,

Another Nasser meeting was
held last night. story on page a.

“—

In response to word of these dEr
‘mands, Student Coordinator Bob
Meyer drafted his proposal early
Tuesday morning. On Tuesday after-
noon he discussed it with President
Leggett and Dean Walker, who said
they would "encourage the iaculty
to consider the matter promptly,”

Meyer’s proposal was approved at
the meeting, with one amendment
added. The proposal makes depart-
mental EPC’S mandatory andpro»
vides for equal student—iaculty rep-
rentation on them. It stipulates that
recommendations be submitted to
the Executive Council "with no dis—
tinction being made between diSpGr
sitions originating irom students
versus iaculty," It also provides
that if either faculty or students are
personally interviewed by the Exe—
cutive Council, the other must be
also.

The amendment rests ”ultimate
decision“ with the majors and in—
structors oi the department in ques—
tion, it the Executive Council ruling
dissatistles the department EPC

library Circulation Rises

Library circulation in the area oi
Black Studies took a sudden jump
Tuesday night, when black students
checked out over ado books irom
Hurling during a onerhour period
students checking out books would
only tell the sob that they were do
ing independent study prolects and
needed the books lor that purpose,
All the books were checked out till
the end oi the semester.

At about 10:00, 39 to 40 black stur
dents began torming a long line at
the circulation desk. Each student
checked out seven 1 volumes at a
time, and some individuals were
seen going through the line twice.

Most oi the books were loaded into
a van parked outside the library and
transported to the Black Cultural
Center, where black students moved
the books irom the van into the side
door Most black students leit the
library about 11-10. The last books
were apparently taken into the Gene
ler shortly oiter ll 30.

Henry Alden, Head Librarian, was
working Tuesday evening, even
though he was scheduled to leave tor

Chicago early Wednesday morning to
attend a meeting concerning the ACM
Periodical Bank. It seems that the
library had received an anonymous
call earlier Tuesday; they were inr
Iormed that a library demonstration
or some sort might take place in
connection with the Tuesday night
meeting to discuss the decision of
the College to tire Alan Nasser
(Philosophy) aitcr next year. Such
an action was indeed discussed in
the meeting, which was taking place
while the books were being checked
out.

Acting Dean of the College Waldo
Walker happened to call Alden shorts
ly after the long line formed at the
circulation desk to see whether any—
thing unustlnl had happened yet
Alden told him that several black
students were checking out books,
but that no violations of library rules
had taken place or seemed likely,

The Library stafI members Con-
tiniled to go about their business,
although the students on the circu-
lation desk were unusually busy
stamping cards.

in the speciiic case oi Nasser’s
contract, the students on the Philor
sophy EPC agreed to reconsider the
entire issue on the basis oi a clear
and detailed sampling oi student
opinion.

This appeared to satisiy a condi-
tion Mr. Worley, the chairman oi
the philosophy department, had set
earlier when he said in a signed
statement that he ”would ask the
philosophy Department to begin re»
consideration oi the recontracting or

Meeting

member, said the EPC would survey
philosophy majors, nonrmajors who
have taken philosophy courses irom
Nasser, anyone who has a philo‘
sophy course irom anyone in the tier
department, and finally all students.

Butcher also said there would be a
meeting or all philosophy majors
soon after spring break to discuss
Nasser's contract He indicated the
EPC would be guided by the matters,

The critical point of the meeting
appeared to be a lack of confidence
on the part of those present, The
question oi "trust” was repeatedly
raised,

locals Dominate Delegation

by steve Nunn

In a smokeriilled room in Monte
zuma, Iowa, under the chairmanship
of Bob Claims of JD's fame, the
Poweshlek county Democratic con-
vention did its thing last Saturday.
Delegates were elected tor the next
stage in the process oi national con-
vention delegate selection, which is
the first district convention in Iowa
City next month. Several members oi
the college community were elected.

Of its 26 allotted delegates, the
convention sent 6 uncommitted, 9for
McGovern and 11 for Muskie.

The meeting also adopted Ii slate at
liberal platiorm resolutions iorpre-
sentation to committees at the dis
trict convention. John Ptltsch, PhySr
ical Education, was elected county
Democratic chairman.

Members oi the Grinnell College
community selected to go to Iowa

Vote Change

By a vote or 49545 .yesterr
day, students approved a prior
posed SGA Constitution change.
As revised, the Constitution now
provides for two SGA Vice
Presidents to take the place oi
the current c otHP President
and awe Board president.

City uncommitted were David Jere
dan, History; Ed Moore, English;
and Pete Smith, Physics. Going tor
McGovern were Fran Cutler; Jack
Doppelt; Fred La Croix, Librarian;
Mary Sweeney; Virginius Thornton

History and American Studies; and
Robert Voertman, Economics.

Grinnell alumnus Phil Mears, who
now lives in Malcom, was also elec-
ted to the McGovern delegation.

Grinnell people going tor Muskie
were Ben Neftzger, Director of the
Computer Center; John David
Renaud, and Al Rosentield.

The meeting ran overtime, and at
one point Globus Cracked, “The sta-,
tutory convention will convene at3
am.” By the time the statutory con~
vention really did convene, around
10:30, the problem oidelegate selec»
tion was not one or competition but
simply one oi iinding enough people
willing to go and kick in $15 “volum
tarily" to Democratic critters at the
same time.

The onset of apathy this provided
was well illustrated by an exchange
between two Grinnell protessors
one at Whom, toward midnight, told
the other he would make ngooddeler
gate to the statutory

Looking up irom the chair by the
Wall to which he had retreated, the
second prot responded, “Don't you
dare even mention my name!“
