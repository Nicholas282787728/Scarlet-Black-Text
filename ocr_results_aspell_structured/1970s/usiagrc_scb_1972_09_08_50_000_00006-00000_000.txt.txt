Bike Hobby Becomes Business

by Maxine Lowy

The shed at 1425 Prince Street
overﬂows with tires, air pumps,
screws, paint, brushes, many un-
identified objects and bicycles-1nd
more bicycles. This impressive
array of paraphernalia is the result
or a hobby begun by Don Sowerr
wine.

Eight years ago, Sowerwine, anate
urally iriendly and cheeriul man,
began fixing bikes [or the neighr
borhood kids. Intended as a leisure
time project after working fullvtlme

on car bodies and fenders, it exe
ploded into what is now a fullrscale
bicycle sales and repair shop. Al-
though all kinds (107, 3-, ‘5»speeds
and 3-wheelers) and makes (Kaikofe,
Pegasus, Peugot, Batavus,. , -) can
be lound in the shop, the ten-speed
bikes predominate since these are in
greater demand.

Sowerwine Ieels himself to be es—
pecially lucky to have stumbled upon
this unexpected business at his,
which has gotten heavier every year.

able reception in lowa City, be said
that that incident ”will change our

Adults.” He believes that he can
relate successfully to the younger
voters, having visited over 300 coir
leges during his Congressional
career (including several visits to
Grinnell) and numerous high schools
as well.

His district contains numerous col-
leges, including the University of
iowa, Wesleyan. Parsons, St. Am-
brose, Marycrest, tive junior coi-
leges, and now Grinnell. Several

other schools border the district
and have many students who will
vote in the first district.

Schwengel hopes to make an ap-
pearance before the Grinnell student
body later in the year.

After a quick cup oi Coffee he rises
to leave again, oifto see somepeople

five-year boom in bicycle sales to
be iollowed by a prosperous period
{or the service people. Himself an
avid bicycle enthusiast, Sowerwine

attributes this rising popularity to
increased television promotions and
the fact that health centers have
recognized this as an excellent way
to exercise.

Sowerwine knows many college stUr
dents, most of the faculty, and even
President Leggett, who hedescrioes
as an “all-around good Jpe.” He
feels close to the college commun»
ity and believes it benefits the entire
town by broadening the public’s
mind.

Speaking as a friend to a iriend,
Don Sowerwine gives students a few
useful tips for protecting their bi-
cycles. With a third ofhis customers
students, Sowerwine advises them to
protect bikes With a heavy chain or
cable padlocked to a post of some

kind As an added precaution, he
suggests registering bikes at the
police department. Sowerwinecom-
mented on his hope that “anyone
caught stealing bicycles will re—
ceive such Still penalty that they
will be afraid to read about it.”
The next time you need a break
hop on your trusty or rusty bike
and pedal over to see Mr. Don
Sowerwine, You‘ll have had a nice
Chat and will have given him a few
minutes of rest that he, too, could
use.

Once again the Used Book Store
is alive and operating in the base~

stores compact cubbyhole. the
books cover a range of almost every
Grlniiell course and are all in ac7

ceptable condition, _
Originally an SGA proiect during

the sixties, the Used Bookstore came
into its own under the leadership of
'72 graduate, John Boyden At this
point the bookstore is run inde-
pendently by its volunteer staff. All
money made is used for the pur-

chase of new books; the bookstore
staff is not paid.

A separate bank account is main»
tained in town for the storealthough
there are no real profits. This has
resulted in a “cold war with the
auditor’s office," according to
Gregg Golden, because all student
accounts should be held by the school
au'ditor. The bookstore stubbornly
clings to its autonomous ways.

“No, we are not buying any more
textbooks," stresses Golden. Wore
ers at the bookstore have been left
with a surplus of miscellaneous lit—
erature and hope to clear out much
of their stock during the sale, Sepr
tember 10 through September 17.
The sale hours will run from one
through three p.m. and seven through
nine p.m. daily. Hardboundtextbooks
will all be priced at two dollars,
paperbound texts at one dollar and
small paperbacks at titty cents.
The staﬂ wishes to remind students
that textbooks for second semester
will be purchased irom students to-
wards the end of the semester.
