A College taxi
service to airport

Completing finals does not necessarily mean an end to
semester agonies. Many still face the problem of getting to the
airport. The signs marking the semiannual exodus to Des
Moines plaster the dining walls before the tUrkey feathers hit
the floor, There is no reason (or transportation to the Des
Moines airport to be so inconvenient and haphazard.

A possible solution for the current frustrating system would
be to organize a shuttle service to the airport with the fleet of
the College’s rally wagons during exam week. The service
should be run twice daily, at 8 a.rn. to make the morning
flights, and again at l p.m. to catch the afternoon and evening
departures. Students should be expected to pay a minimal fee
of Si to help defray costs, and the maior portion could be

subsidized by SGA.

The same solution could also be used in January when
classes resume. The shuttle service could run Jan. 13 and 19
from the airport at 1 pm. and ii p.m. to return students in

time for classes.

Signrup for the shuttle service Could be handled either
through a mailbox stuffing or at tables outside of the dining

halls.

Organizing the endrofrthersemeste'r crunch out of town
would be very beneficial to students who are already under
severe academic pressure. We urge SGA to seriously consider

financing such a service.

Price: advisers
dictate courses

To the Editor:

I have had the unpleasant ex
perience, as a junior transier
student declaring a major field of

study, to discover that the English .

and History Department chairmen
disregard the requirements
(stated in the College Catalogue)
for their respective majors. I have
been intormed by Mr. Moore,
{English Department Chairman),
that to receive an English major I
must take 3 Shakespeare course.
This is contrary to the major
requirements that are recorded in
the current college bulletin,
Likewise, l have experienced the
same problem with Mr. Jordan,
History Department Chairman,
when I changed my major from
English to History. Mr. Jordan
refused to sign my prerregistration
card for next. semester until I
acquiesced to his demand 0] ads
ding a European History course to
my schedule. This, too, was in
direct violation of the History
major requirements aslisted in the
College Catalogue which
“recommends” an European
History course, but does not
require it.

Whelhcr or not 21 student. can
have a “good" English major
without a Shakespeare course, or
have a “reasonable" History
major without a course in
European History is not the issue.
What is crucial is the power that
advisers have over students who do
not conform to lheir
thinking. If an adviser does not
sign a student’s c *d. the student
cannot register and hence cannot
graduate An advisers role should
be to advise, not dictate.

Another disturbing thought is [he
tact Ihat these two Department
Chairmen are not ethical enough to

way of‘

inllow the guidelines that their own
departments have established. is it
too much to ask that these gen-
tlemen adhere to departmental

policy? And if they cannot follow

these procedures with a clear
conscience, then to change them
and notify the College Community
what the new requirements are?

Mr. Jordan tried to justify his
dictatorial stance by explaining:
“Since you are a new student, you

haven’t had the benefit of being
advised by one of us,” Just what
does he mean when he uses the
word advise?

I am not implying that all adr
visers think and act along these
lines. It is my behei that most of
the protessors at Grinnell fulfill
their duties as advisers quite
capably and admirably. Un-
fortunately. there are some
notable exceptions

I talked to Mary Eysenbach,
Dean of Curriculum, and her
response was: “How can you

course?"

Illusion of Iibe ty

by Ken Talbert

Speaking on the “Democratic Myth in a Capitalist
Society,” or. Claude Lightfoot, a leading black
American communist, struck out against What he
considered to be the illusion of liberty in out
“democratic," system in his presentation in the
South Lounge, Friday, Nov. 22 lie discussed what
he telt were the “misconceptions people have oi our
‘democratic‘ System.” p _

Lightfoot said the Lockean ideal claimed “politics
should be the elitist expression“ rather than an
expression of the people, and that ”preservation oi
property is the essence of government " To
Rousseau, Lightloot credited the belief that in
government, there should be formal procedures
which would allow dictatorship, or fascism, if or
when the capitalistic system is threatened by the
“tyranny oi the majority" .

Lightloot said the authors of the Constitution tried
and succeeded in many ways in accomodating these
ideals. The ”democratic way” betrayed the in-
terests of the American people irom its very con
ception. “Democracy in this society is designed to
defend capitalism,” he stated.

» Speaking more oi the present, Lightioot felt that
the United States now stands at a “Crossroad bet»
ween democracy and fascism," Using Watergate as
an illustration, he pointed out the iallacy in saying

Peck:

that Watergate and the resulting resignation of
Nixon and many oi his aides proved that the
American system worked. Nixon’s resignation
proved little, he said since Watergate was more a
downfall in the system, “rather than an individual
downfall"; and although we are rid oi Nixon, the
system that allowed him his tyrannical powers still
exists.

Lightfoot noted that in times of crisis there is a
concentration of power in the ofﬁce of the
presidency as provided ior by our governmental
system: He felt. this was well exhibited in the use of
the military by several recent presidents to wage
full scale undeclared wars in Korea and Viet Nam.
Also, the use of National Guardsmen in numerous
cases of domestic unrest showed that the president
also has the power to wage undeclared war Within
the US Thus the capabili ' exists within any
presidency to institute a fascist state.

When asked what actions would be effective in
reversing this fascist trend, Lightfoot pointed out
the necessity of removing the military/industrial
complex from the source of power, of making the
legislative branch the mainstream of government,
and iinully, Ior the American people to unite and
discard the American “democracy” for a more
equitable socialist option.

Counter spies

by Third World Group

Winslow Peck, a former intelligence analyst tor
the super secret National Security Agency oi the
Federal government spoke Nov. 21. Sponsored by
the Third World Group, Peck presented a slide show
depicting highlights of the clandestine actions or
“dirty tricks" of national security iorces since
World War II.

Peck is currently working with approximately 150
iormer intelligence workers, researchers, scholars,
students. and a low journalists in creating a Fifth
Estateian alternative intelligence community
Their aim is to use the techniques oi government
intelligence agencies as well as new techniques to
spy on the agencies themselves, exposing any
abuses oi power, corruption or experiments in
technoiacism

Peck pointed out that there is no need to use
illegal methods as 80 to 90 per cent of the in
iormation on all government activities, including
the most secret actions oi the CIA, can be found
through scientific research.

Winslow's speech and the slide show stressed the
need to fully understand us global strategy in order
to understand Watergate, drug busts, police sur-
veillance, wiretapping or the CIA and FBI. The
Slide show demonstrated that foreign policy and

domestic policy are merely two aspects oi the same
global strategy.

Winslow called these actions experiments in
technofascism Technofascism, he explained is
probably the last form which fascism can take in
the late twentieth century, This form is a result of
modern technology which enables our security
forces to maintain social control and enforce
government policy. However, it is the same as
Classical fascism, for both are the final option
available to the power elites in any given capital
society to maintain the political slatusquo.

chhnoiascism represents the last attempt to
prevent mass participation in the processes of
society and as such as a “last ditch solution to the

—power oi the people. The key to its defeat is constant
vigilance and struggle ”

Winslow found Grinnell to be especially receptive
to the message of the Fifth Estate, “Grinnell is an
excellent example of the fact that the movement is
not dead but is just reexamining its understanding
of the world situation and of the ways to proceed.
Students ability to promote change is undeniable. If
this were just a utopian dream or a new left fantasy
the government wouldn’t have spent all that time
and money trying to stop the student based antirwar
movement.

Darragh: corrects misquotation

Dear sirs:

In your article on the Public
Events Committee on Nov. 22, two
issues were rather confused Being

(coming primarily from a

decrease in the Major Concerts

a student member ol the com-
mittee for three years, as well as
an oceassional employee ior iour
years, I realize the complexity oi
the situation. However, i lhlnk the
issues should be set straight,
First, after talking to Mr. Fudge

. about the withdrawal of the music

department monetary support, we
came to the conclusion that he was
misquoterl. He did not feel that the
linal calendar oi events presented
by the committee was short on the

dance that was referred to did not.
in tact materialize in the programs
presented for either 197142 or 1972-
ii, The major reason that the
music department withdrew its
funds, be ielt, was that the specific
interest areas oi the individual
faculty members were not being
met. I found this to be the case
irom my own experience, For
instance, I was told by Mr. Wyly
idircctor oi Collegium) that he
thought the committee would not
have been interested in bringing on

policy

to teach a poetry seminar and tor
tenured iaculty members to hold

slumber parties in their
classrooms

ililorj sicbci-L

bers gave the same argument»
except that they wanted a quartet.
One other member wanted a
composer (his speciality).
Although these arguments struck
me as rather closerminded at the
time, what the department has
done with their money this year
cannot be argued with Lena
Horne will be coming second
semester to sing with Young,
Gifted and Black. Through per
sonal contact with her, they got her
for a songea very good song, I
might add.

The second issue deals with John
Hansen‘s statement. Hansen states
that SGA supports Public Events,
but I dispute this. The committeee
continually has had to light to
maintain student lunding, Last
year, both Mr. Cavanagh (the
current chairman) and I lobbied
will] the 197243 SGA to increase
their iunding. We were assured of

budget), But when John Hansen
came into power and the budget
was put into effect, we discovered
that our funding was cut back to
the original $5.000 oi the previous
year. When I looked into the
matter, I found that the money was
again directed into Major Conr
certs, Major Concerts had ab
sorbed the $2500 that had been cut
from our budget the year before.
As far as I can see. Hansen’s claim
that “the politics within the
committee caused the initial
reduction” is completely false. I
have seen no evidence of this in the
past three years on the committee.
What I have seen is an emphasis
on rock concerts at the expense of
high culture. Whether this be the
result oi a short-sighted SGA or a
short-sighted student body. I tool it
is indeed deleterious to the liberal
arts education Grinnell oiiers,
