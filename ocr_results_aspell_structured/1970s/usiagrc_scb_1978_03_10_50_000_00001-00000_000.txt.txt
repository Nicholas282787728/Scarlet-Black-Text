Faculty approves end-of-course evaluation

by Mark Mayer

The faculty voted 48 to 24 at last
Monday’s faculty meeting to adopt
an Executive Council proposal that
will replace the current system of
student evaluation of faculty
members’ teaching performances
with an end-of—course evaluation
system.

The proposal accepted by the
iaculty on Monday is the same
proposal rejected 30 to 29 at the
February 13 Faculty Meeting, No
revisions were made in the
proposal between the two
meetings.

.\5 A result of the proposals
passage, the present system of
evaluation, based on 40 intervtews
with randomly selected students
who have taken one or more
courses from the instructor being
evaluated. will be replaced with a
system based solely on endot-
coursc evaluations. Under the new
system. all professors Will be
required to hand out a standard
evaluation form to all students
either during the last week of
classes or during the final
examination period,

 

According to Dean Waldo
Walker, end-of—coursc evaluation
forms will probably be distributed
at the end of the present semester.
It is possible, though, that im»
plementatiun oi the new system
may be delayed until next
semester.

UNDER the provisions of the
new system. data gathered will not
be used ior iaculty personnel
considerations until three
Semesters’ worth of data is
accumulated Accordingly, the
present evaluation system will
continue in use until the first
Semester of the 1979-30 academic
year,

Under the new system. the
completed iorms idr all proiessors
being considered for promotion or
tenure will be collated and sum-
marized by the departmental
EPC, Summaries of the professor's
teaching periormance will then be
sent to the Executive Council for a
personnel decision. Copies Will also
be sent to the chairperson of the
appropriate department and to the
instructor being considered for
purposes of iaculty development.

Moyer shines in great debate

by Eric Berry

Reaction throughout the campus
community to Monday's Panama
Canal debate between Iowa At-
torney General Richard ’lurner
and Political Science Professor H
Wayne Moyer indicates a general
consensus that Moyer outsargued
Turner on the issues,

Yet there is also an awareness
among members of the faculty and
civic leaders of Grinnell that
Turner's argument was not
calculated to appeal to a college
audience.

MOYER. spcaking first, held
that the treaties presently before
the Senate passed two basic tests.
Ratification, he argued, is in the
best national interest, and it is
consistent with the principles on
which this country was founded,
While explaining the provisions
of the treaties, he pointed out that
the U.S. would retain a 5 to 4 ad
vantage on the committee that
would controlCanal policy until the

that the Panama Canal treaties
should be ratified,

The debate was held in front of
a boisterous overflow crowd in
Roberts Theatre. The moderator
waSHistory Professor Joseph Wall.
It was sponsored by the Grinnell
College Republicans.

Introducing the debaters,
Wall likened Turner’s appearance
on campus to Egyptian President

.Anwar Sadat's journey to Israel,

He was referring to,Turner’s long,

year 2000, and that the payments to
Panama would be covered by the
increased Canal toll. Also. Moyer
asserted thatthe overall cost of the
new treaties to the U.S. economy

would be only $12-14 million, and ‘

that the maintenance of the
military bases in the zone would
still cost less than the maintenance

Japan and Korea

Turner spent part oi his twelve
minute opening statement talking
about the Ptel'odactyi, streakers

procedure, unlike the present,
student EPC members will not be
involved in collecting the students
responses There will be no more
interviewing.

Alter faculty rejection of the
Council's proposal on February 13,
a letter urEinE reconsideration and
further discussion of the CounCll's
proposal was sent to all faculty
members. The letter was drafted
by Professor of Anthropology and
Executive Council member Ronald
Kurtz and signed by nine other
faculty members,

THE letter noted that the
proposal originally failed ior a
wide variety oi reasons, including
administrative problems, amr
biguities in the proposal, and
concern over undue reliance on
statistical data. it was felt that
many of these problems would be
cleared up in iurther discussion
“A number oi people who_voted
against the Council's motions
nevertheless accept some of the
Council’s assumptions," the letter
read, “Clearly there is a need lot
more discussion and for

and Donald Kaul, the columnist for
the Des Moines Register. He
proceeded to recount the history oi
the Panamanian revolution,
emphasizing that the U.S. did not
instigate the insurrection. Ac»
cording to Turner, the new treaties
would require the U.S. “to pay $30
million a year or more." He also
emphasized that “we built it” and
“we own it."

IN rebuttal. Moyer challenged
Turner’s claim that the U.S. owns
the Canal, citing a 1948 Supreme
Court decision that ruled that the
Canal was a territory over which
the US. does not have sovereignty.
Moyer also argued that theU S, did
not purchase the Canal Zone, but
rather had purchased the right to
use it,

After the rebuttals, the debaters
were questioned by a three
member panel consisting oi
History Professor Alan Jones,
local businessman and life-long
Republican Dick Poynter, and Ted
Vlamls, of the Grinnell College
Republicans

Turner stated. in response to
a question'irom Vlamis, that if he
were a Panamanian and knew the
history of the Canal, he would
support retention of American
sovereignty. He said that he was
more concemed that the U.S.
would appear as “fraidy cats”
to the World, having backed down
in Panama as well as in Vietnam
and Cambodia, than as an im-
perialist oppressor.

l AFTER the debate, Turner
commented that his historical
emphasis was appropriate.

“I got the whole argument in
eventually, and the history is
necessary if we are to understand
why we are not oppressing these
people.” he said.

Most students interviewed after
the debate ielt that Moyer made

picture oi iaculty development and
evaluation,” the letter urged

in THE meeting. it was quickly
and overwhelmingly voted to
reopen discussion on the Council's
proposal,

Kurtz reviewed some of the
reasons why the Executive Council
wished to bring its proposal before
the faculty again He argued that
the present system is flawed, that
it misrepresents student opinion
and that it does not provide ior
faculty development as well as

evaluation This, he claimed was
unfair to tunior faculty members

KURTZ also addressed some of
the criticisms leveled against the
proposed system in the February
13 meeting. most notably by
Associate Professor of English
Peter Connelly,

Kurtz argued that the new
system will not lead to “popularity
contests.” as Connellv had claimed
earlier. He maintained that ”the
proposed system does not argue a ,
lack of laith" in the faculty, as
some had argued at the February
