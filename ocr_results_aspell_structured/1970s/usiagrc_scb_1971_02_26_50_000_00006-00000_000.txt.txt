Flannguns: 'RA Flexible Job’

by Barb Rabyne

Bob and Mary Flanagan, RA's
for Loose, feel that living
there hasn't been anything but
an advantage for them. After
receiving a BA in English,
Mary taught 7th grade and
betame "interested in work
ing with college students on a
personal level." Bob had re-
ceived a MA in Religion and
a Master of Divinity from the
Christian Theological Semin-
ary. As a church youth work
er, he has had experience in
counseling.

~ Before arriving at Grinnell,
Bob "had looked on the job of
RA primarily in terms of
counseling. However, in the
course of working with this
dorm, which is gifted with ex-
ceptionally good officers and
SA's, ‘the role of counseling
is pretty well handled by
them." Mary added, "in

Loose, our rolehas been more
as a facilitator and supporter
of student activities, and ine
volves getting to know the
students as friends. That has
been the enriching part of the
job."

The Flanagans feel that their
activities should be largely
conﬁned to the dorm. last
semester, they were asked by
the Board of Religion to lead
Interpersonal Relation groups
in the dorm, and this SemeS’
ter, Mr. Haas asked them to
lead an Engagement and Mar—
riage discussion group. They
are also encouraging sex dis-
cussion groups in the dorm.
”The RA should be involved
in the life of the hall and she

‘ ould be concerned With what
goes onthere," Bobsaid. "It's
very important for an RA no:
to think of his job as primar-
ily problem solving. The em-
phasis is on working with SELF
dents and the RA must have
something to offer to the hall."
“It's important to (are enough
to get involved," Mary added.

Bob admits, “The fact that
we don‘t have a private life is
sometimes frustrating, butwe
find the communal type ofliv-
ing very rewarding also. Most
of the people here respect our
need for privacy." “Be»
sides," Mary said, ”the Job
is ﬂexible enough. Every day
is different. You never know
what to expect. It's demand-
ing. but I em'ov it."

Bob feels that there's de-
finitely a need for a coordinr
ator of counseling. “1 see the
RA system as still an experi-
mental program, organized
with the idea that the hall is
a self-governing body and the
students are able to govern
themselves. It's important to
get RAs who can not only
counsel students, butcanwork
as advisors assistingstudents
to run the halls, and making
the hall system work.”

What are the Flanagan's gen-
eral impressions of Grinnell?
Mary "really likes the inde-
pendence and flexibility which
the students have here. We
heard it was very liberal and
the students were concerned..
It's interesting to see the role
students played in abolishing
requirements." However, she
also feels, “Grinnell isapro‘
tected world. Every chance
students can take to break
away from her during vaca-
tions will be beneficial to
them."

Bob agreed with Mary that
“the general approach to edu-
cation here, independent
study, and experimentation
with life styles, allows stud-
ents much freedom. Whatdisr
appoints me most, is that a
large number ofstudents seem
to be satisfied to remain wh-
ere they are. They're notwile
ling to go out of their way to
relate to people who are dif‘
ferent from themselves. 'T‘hr
ere needs to be a balance be,
tween ”doing your own thing,’
individual desires, and social
needs. There is frustration,
but sometimes they seek sec-
urity as students rather than
seeking other humans across
the spectrum."

one departmentand 24- credits
overall. (The limit does not
include special topics.) This
limit must be approved by the
faculty as a whole, since it in-
volves general college policy.
‘The subcommittee has also
recommended that the general
limit on credits for a major
be raised from 30 to 32. The
figure of 30 Was established
when the college had mostly
three credit courses. That
recommendation also must be
approved by the faculty.

McBee Serves As Middleman

Part I: Problems and Philos-
ophy of Bookstore Manage-
ment

"The bookstore has been a
second class citizen," says
Tom McBee, the manager of
the Grinnell College Book
store. Not just at Grinneli,
but across the country, book-
store managers must face
“students who think they are
being taken, faculty members
who expect the manager to
read their minds and publislr
ers who don't give a damn.”
In his role as mediator be-
tween the publisher and the
college community, the book
store manager is particularly
isolated; he is the “middle-
man" in a double sense--first
as the distributor of goods
and services in the capitalist
economic system and second
as the arbitrator between the
desires and needs of students
and faculty and the interests
of the publishers.

Students rank first on Mc—
Bee's priority list. “My first
obligation is to the students,"
he said in a conversation whr
ich stemmed from the Lib‘
rary- Bookstore Committee's
concern over shoplifting in the
bookstore He is glad to have
his office where he is acces-
sible, where "people can ask
all the questions they want.I
will be happy to talk to any
organization, any group of
people (about the bookstore)
with a day's or a half day's
notice. 1 don't want to waitfor
a crisis or problems toarise,
because then people's minds
are already made up. Come
plaints don't always get back
to me; I would like to hear
them. I'm not hiding anything
and I would be awfully dis-
appointed 'if‘people'thought I
was'." Throughout the'converr
sation McBee showed hisgood
faith in the student body.

The recent curriculum ree
vision is having a decided im-
pa ct upon bookstore ordering.
Whereas in the past one could
anticipate a given number of
students taking a certain re
quired course in any semes~
ter, today one can anticipate
virtually nothing. To further
compound the problem, 200
students did not pref register
for this semester, and many
changed their registration up
on returning-to school in Jan»
uary. Certainly it is,andmust
remain, the right of the stud-
ent to change his registration.
However, a longer period of
pre-registration (which is
being planned) and publication
of book lists before pre-regis-
tration might help students to
decide more conclusively and
would thus facilitate bookstore
ordering. (Thanks to LoniCa»

milli for the suggestions.)

The sarcalled "paperback
revolution" further complica»
tes ordering. Asmanyas 12 or
15 paperbacks may be sub-
stituted for a textbook in a
single course. Ina coursewith
an optional list of 40 books-—
which is certainly not to re-
ﬂect upon the enlightenedout-
look of its instructor—the in»
structor must guess howmany
of his students will pursue a
particular direction in the op-
en-ended course in order to
estimate the number of copies
of each book to be ordered.
Another ordering problem
stems from the fact that cop-
ies of successive books used
in a course do not sell equally
well; in fact, each book sells
fewer copies than its immed—
iate predecessor. Perhaps
100% of the enrolled students
buys the first book, but only
60% buys the last. And some
books said to be required turn
out not to be required. With
new courses each semester,
the “paperback revolution",
revised booklists each sem~
ester and more books per
course, it becomes impera-
tive that the bookstore receive
accurate faculty orders on
time.

Once faculty members make
dieir educated guesses as to
books needed, the question
becomes, ”When will they
arrive?” or “Will they ar-
rive?" Communimtions be-
tween bookstores andpublishe
ers are slow. If the book is
available, it will take two or
three weeks to arrive, most
probably three. However, if
the book is out of print or
otherwise unavailable, the
manager will likely not learn
of the situation until about the
time the book is expected to
“mew/met. itoo oftentcoin-
cides with the time the book
is needed for class. Some pub»
lishers do not do their own
printing. They buy a certain
amount of time from aprinter
per month and if the printer
runs through the time, jobs
which are not done wait an-
other month. The publisher,
meanwhile, may be out of
stock.

its value in handling. The typ‘
ing of orders is not included
in this figure, but studies
elsewhere indicate that it
costs $1~$2 per letter in per
sonnel time. To return a single
copy of a $2.50 book would
cost $2 or $3. Rather than re
turn just a few copies of a
book, Mr. McBee would hold
them on the shelves in hopes
of selling them or wouldmark
them down. Postage is high
now and will probablygohigh-
er; freight rates have gone up
and postage will go up in the
next ﬁve years. In fact die 4th
class book rate may be nearly
eliminated by 1975.

What about books which do
not sell? Returns are expenr
sive, and return policies vary
with the publisher. A small
minority of publishers permit
no returns. Another minority
permits returns for only 60
or 90 days. A minority of
large publishers permits 100%
returns for 9, 12 or even 15
months. However, most pub-
lishers are now restricting
returns on the basis of the
previous year‘s purchase. A
common figure forallowed re-
turns is 20% of last year’s
sales. However, assume that
last year the bookstore bought
$1000 worth of books from a
company, and this year itbuys
$5000 worth. On the basis of
last year's purchase it can
return no more than $200
worth of books. It is stuck
with any unsaleable books in
excess of this amount.

Mr. McBee's primary inter
est in the bookstore is in de-
veloping the book section. "My
first obligation is to build up
the book department. My
really important contributions
are above and beyond books
used in class. I believe in a
dynamic store, in getting a
lot of new things-~sothatpeo~
pie will want to come in, want
to read, want to buy." He
views "wanting to buy" as a
step forward in building one's
interests and knowledge. To
McBee, the bookstore and the
library are the two most im-
portant thing on the college
campus. Students will not at-
tend classes all their lives,
but the skills and desires they
acquire in reading will be
theirs all their lives
