IOWA STATE UNIVERSITYV‘Widespread sex discriminar
tion" was discovered at lowa State University in Ames by
a recent study headed by Dr. Marguerite Scruggs.

Among the finding were that women faculty members were
discriminated against in hiring, salaries and promotions-
that iunds for women’ s athletics are significantly less than
those for men 5 programs, that women are notably lacking
in the schools top level administration; and that women
students are discriminated against in certain classes.

Scruggs is quoted in a copyrighted story inthe Des Moines

~Register as noting that, “in being this way, the university

is really reflecting the society of which it is a part, so it

is really not surprising".

The university recently hired an aiiirmative action officer
who will be charged with recommendations to end all types
oi discrimination at the university.

PARSONS COLLEGE--Following several years of ilnancial
turmoil, Parsons College in Fairiield lowa staged its final
exercises of Commencement on June 2.

College ofiicials had hoped to reach an arrangement with
the schools creditors, to allow the school time to rebuild
its enrollment. However, Federal Bankruptcy Judge Richard
F. Stageman ordered the school to post a $250,000 bond,
and college officials cited this, coupled with projections oi
continued low enrollment, as the reasons for closing the
school.

no Fairlield campus, as large as that of Drake univer-
sity, is presently standing vacant, awaiting the arrival
of another tenant -- which currently seems unlikely,

UNIVERSITY OF lOWA»—A controversy over the value of
the pass»iail grading system at the University of lowa
erupted in July with a prediction by the Dean oi the College
at Liberal Arts thatiewerproiessors willallow such grading
‘ in their classes.

Dean Dewey Stuit revealed the results oi a study show-
iiig that, as passeiail has increased, so has the average
Grade Point Average (GPA)--while overall quality of work
in the pass-tail courses has dropped,

Stuit recommended that his colleagues at U oi I carefully
examine the value oi pass iail grading relative to the stu
dents performance.

Non-resident tuition at the University oi Iowa has been
raised $100 per year for undergraduate students and
$250 ior graduate students.

The increases were, in eiiect, caused by the iowa Leg~
islature’s decision to cut $2.6 million from the State
Board oi Regents budget.

Politics

DRUG LAWS--Vance Bourjailly, author and University of
lowa professor, predicted in the August edition of Harper’s
Magazine‘ that marijuana will be legalized in Iowa by 1980.
Bourjailly bases his prediction on an analysis oi changing
voting attitudes. According to his schedule. the 1976 Iowa
Democratic platiorm will advocate outright legalization,
while the Republican stance will iavor decriminallzation.
In [978, he estimates, marijliana legalization advocates
will win the needed seats in the Iowa Legislature to push
legalization through in the 1979 session.

LEG‘lSLATURErvThe Iowa Legislature completed a is?
day session on June 24, devoting most oi its time to spend-
ing bills and consideration oi the state budget tor the next
two years Speciiic legislation is discussed under indivi-
dual headings throughout this summary.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK AUGUST 24, 1573

Sunday Liquor, Rock Music,

LioUOR—Signiiic‘ant action concerning sales oi liquor was
taken on two ironts by the 1973 Iowa Legislature.

The age of majority was lowered irom 19 to IE, meaning .
18 year olds can now buyanddrinkliquor, enter into binding
contracts, and sue and be sued.

In addition, after heated debate, the legislature approved

.a plan to allow the sale of liquor by the drink on Sunday.

A special license is required, and only establishments in
cities and counties which have approved Sunday liquor
sales are eligible to apply.

In addition, only commercial establishments which do 50%
or more oi their business in nonralcoholic products are
allowed to apply for the special licenses.

The Grinnell City Council approved the Sunday sale or liquor
in a meeting July is.

EDWARD MEZVINSKYVIowa Congressman Edward M8Z~
vinsky announced July is that he and his wife Myra are
temporarily separated.

The Mezvinskys, who have been married l2 years, are
“trying to work out their problems” while Mezvinsky is
serving his first term in the House.

The couple was separated several weeks beforetheoiiicial
announcement from Mezvinsky’s Washington ofiice.

SENATOR JACK MlLLER»Foi‘mer Senator Jack Miller,
who was deieated in November by Democrat Dick Clark,
was named to a federal judgeship by president Nixon in
late June -- with Senate approval of the appointment
taking less than so seconds,

Miller was named to a $42,500 per year associate judr
geship on the US. Court oi Customs and Patent Appeals
in Washington.

POLITICSrvGovernor Robert Ray is on the horns at an
interesting dilemma. ,

Ray must decide whether to run for an unprecedented
fourth term as governor (which, under the newly approved
constitutional amendment, would last iour years) or to run
against Iowa’s Senior Senator, Harold Hughes.

If Ray runs for governor, he is considered to be almost
lnvinceable. Control oi the governor’s chair almostassures
continued Republican domination of the statehouse ,, an
important tactor to Ray in light oi the Democratic gains in
the last general election.

On the other hand, some analysts see Hughes as being
more Vulnerable in the “374 election than ever before
in his political career. And, a victurv over Hughes would
be anothernpward step in Ray’s political career.

A decision is expected later this year.

JOHN SCHMIDHAUSER--John Schmidhauser (D-Iowa City),
a former lowa Representative who was deieated in the l972
Democratic Primary by current First DistrictRepresenta-
tive Ed Mezvlnsky, has left Iowa.

Schmidhauser, who has been teaching at the University
oi Iowa is leaving the state to become Chairman oi the
Department oi Political Science at the University ofSouthern
Caliiornia

Schmidhauser upset Republican Fred Schwengel in 1964, and
served in Congress irom 1964 to 1966. However, Schwengel
deteated him in 1966 and returned to his seat, holding oil a
Schmidhauser challenge in loan.

Palo, IA moved a step closer towards completion in mid
June when the atomic Energy Commission (AEC) approved
a final construction permit for the facility.

Officials- of lowa Electric Light and Power Company in
Cedar Rapids say the iacility is 93% complete and that
loading of the reactor will begin early in the fall.

Several Iowa environmental and public interest groups,
including the Iowa Student Public Interest Research Group
(ISPIRG) have opposed the facility. They iorced an additional

environmental impact hearing May 3, which resulted in the
iavorable arc decision.

BICYCLING IN IOWA—-Interest in Iowa bicycling and bike

GAMBLING-Polk County Sheriff’s deputies carried out the
largest gambling raid in the county‘s history on July 10.

The deputies, heavily armed and moving in strict secrer
Cy, raided three taverns and an upstairs apartment, which
they entered by battering down the glass door with a shot—
gun.

West Des Moines Police were unaware of the raid in their
city until almost a quarter of an hour after the raid began.

However, the Polk County Grand Jury refused earlier
this month to bring indictments against any of the seven
men arrested in the raid.

A controversy over the composition of the Grand Jury is
continuing, and the iinal outcome of the raid is still unclear.

nocx MUSlCnIowa was the site oi two major rock ies-
tivals over the summer. A scheduled test in Jones County
was cancelled for July 4, but another festival was held in
Davenport on the holiday.

About 5,000 music fans crowded the mud filled levee
showgrounds to hear nine bands play for a lull day. There
were no serious problems the day of the concert, although
a Davenport alderman was arrested for criminal trespass.

However, Davenport oiiicials seized some assets of the
concert promoter, primarily iencing valued at about $2200,
because concert promoters allegedly failed to clean up the
concert site.

A second rock festival in Burt on July 3 was shortened
when a ilght erupted between members oi rival motorcycle
clubs, The Buifalo Creek Jamboree drew only about 900
participants. .

Food'Supply:
Very light

“Unbelievable."

Saga Food Service is having trou-

ble getting almost every kind or
food, according to Jerry Ramaker,
food service director.
“It used to he that we called supp-
-liers to find out how much some
thing would cost us. Now, the gueSr
tion is, can we get it at all, And
often we can’t.”

In addition to the widely discussed
meat shortage, Ramaker noted that
a long list of other foods are either
completely unavailable or are avail»
able only in limited quantities. He
cited peaches, apple sauce, andpeas
as Just three examples.

“Its important tor all the people
eating in the dining halls to take ,
only what they can eat. The food in
our garbage will simply make the
shortage that much worse at the
next meal.”

Ramaker is sending a short letter
to all members ofthecollegecomm-
unity urging them to help conserve
food.

He added that, although steaks have
so iar been unavailable, he is still
hopeiul that steak can be obtained
in time for the first regular Sate
urday night dinner on September i,
“We will have good meals. But
we may not have three entrees ior
awhile, Just ask everyone to be
patient —- it’s a diiiicult time for
us."
