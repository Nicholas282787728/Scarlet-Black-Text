no alternative but to pay {or
everything themselves “The Overall
cost per year," said St Thomas, “is
around $1000." The club must pay |tS

», own tournament tees, which run $100,
union fees, which run 375, referees,
hotel rooms gasoline. He said that
“this did not even include wear and
tear on the cars or the cost of
uniiorms." Players have to provide

, their own uniiorm. The jersey costs
$20, the pants cost $10, the socks cost
$750. plus cleats, which average 325.

St. Thomas also pointed out that it is
a tradition for the host team to pro-
vide a party tor the visiting team other
the game. He says “it is the only sport
where it is expected that the players
play the game and then come off the
ﬁeld to get drunk and talk about the
play.” Hawbaker says that “to not
provide a party tor the visiting squad
is to not honor the tradition and to soil
the reputation of the home squad.” He
also painted out that “it all comes out
oi our own pockets."

While the average player is cons
stantly contributing money to the
team, players such as Hawbaker and
St. Thomas have dropped as much as

3300 during a year. ”There is no other
way tor the club to exist,” said
Hawbaker.

Both Hawbaker and St. Thomas
worry that this year the expenses will
be overbearing They expect to have
to transport as many as 40 people to
away games.

Athletic Director John Pfitsch says
he ”sympathizes with the players, but
mat it is not 'thin his department to

give them money,” Pfitsch also says
that he doubts the rugby club will be
admitted as a team “because of’ ‘
economic and personnel problems
already existing within the athletic
program." He said that “ii a coach.
