LETELIER colnnicntcd Monday
night that Allende’s election in 1970
occasioned great optimism among
the Chilean people.

“There was joy in the streets and
so much hope , . , everybody was
excited. , . I wish I could bring you
that exhilarating ieeling of people
who felt dignity for the first time in
their lives,” she said.

DESPITE this general feeling of
optimism, she stated, Allende's
plans to nationalize banking, in-
stitute land reform and nationalize
the mines were very discomforting
ior the Chilean right wing. i

“(Allende's plans) . , . were not
beautiful for the people who had
traditionally held power and
prestige. tThey) felt threatened . . .
with this equality around, they ielt
Sort of naked," she Said.

LETELIER argued that the
junta's desire to eradicate
Marxism amounted to a full-
ﬂedged assault on the population.

“They have declared war On
Marxism, and they have declared
war on all the people who have
supported Allende. That was halt
the population," she said.

BOTH Lctelier and the Chilean
resistance movement have
maintained, despite their deep

“We do believe in democracy,

dictatorship are trying to restore
democracy through democratic
resistance, which has manifested
itself through a clandestine press.
university movements, cultural
events, and unions," she said.

Although opposition to the
Pinochet regime has focused
primarily on the political abuses
which are occurring in Chile,
Letelier recognizes that there is a
sociO-cconomic, as well as
political, dimension to the issue of
human rights.

"I GIVE every human right
great importance. But first, you
must be alive, healthy and be able
to read to have freedoms such as
freedom of the press, . I don't see
how you can guarantee freedom of

said,

plans to invest over tsl billion in

she said, “they Won't need bi»

as not to reveal his deception.
Newman challenges the iniamous
Minnesota Fats and becomes so
caught up in the struggle to win
that he sacrifices everyone and
everything before he comes to his
senses. Tile film’s grand climax is
the big pool game, a nerve-racking
contest for both participants,

Newman not only looks nice but
acts well, too. It’s good to see him
without Robert Redford lurking
about. The scene in Which Newman
explains to his girlfriend why he
has to play pool may well be the
best thing he’s ever done, Other
excellent acting includes Jackie
Gleason as tough, awe-inspiring
Minnesota Fats and George C
Scott as a sleazy gambler. Piper
Laurie, who was so intense as the
fanatically-religious mother in
Carrie. plays Newman’s neurotic
girliriend.

Tyson's statement as a "fresh
current of air coming in to that
stale room.”

On the negative side, however,
she pointed to the statements of the
iormer Secretary of State, Henry
Kissinger, and thc currciit under-
secretary oI State, both of whom
have refraincd from criticizing
PilioChet's human rights records
while they were in Chile

JIMMY Carter, according to
Leteller, has been viewed “ith
hope by the Chilean people in her
opinion. he has a genuine concern
(or human rights. even though she
feels this Concern has manifested
itself more in cases involving
socialist countries than in those
involving us. allies.

"I think he is genuinely in-
terested in the issue. I Cannot doubt
that he is interested, What is im
portant is what kind of human
rights he's most concerned With,
and also, i don’t know about his
understanding about countries that
are dependent on the US,” While
he criticizes socialist nations who
are out of the American sphere of
influence, dependent nations
“would benefit enormously if
social, economic and cultural
rights were the principle factor in
their relations with the United
States,” she said,

CLEARLY. one of the main ob-
jectives of the Chilean exiles like
Letelier is to maintain in-
ternational pressure on the
Pinochet government. Such
pressure, she feels, gives the
people of Chile “tremendous
strength to do daring things." This,
according to Letelier. is necessary
it the Chilean people are ever to
restore democracy to ”the faithful
replica of paradise."
