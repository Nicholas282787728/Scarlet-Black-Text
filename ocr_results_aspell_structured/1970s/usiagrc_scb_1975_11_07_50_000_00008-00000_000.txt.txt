It had been four years since the
Grinnell football Pioneers had won
a road game and one decade since
they hadregistered a shutout. Both
streaks were “ruined" last
Saturday when the team defeated
lhe University of Chicago, 2870, in
Chicago.

Against the improving. but still
weak Maroons, the Pioneers
gained yardage almost as they
pleased. The team moved between
the twentyryard lines mostly on the
running of senior fullback Tom
Goetz, who had one of his best days
of the season \vith a little more
than 150 yards rushing, Once near
the twenties, the pass attack took
over. Grinnell quarterbacks threw
four touchdown aerials from
around that territory,

The defense was Cqually efr
icctive, The Chicago passing ate
tack was almost nonexistent and
the Pioneers stopped the running
game. with the exception of a low
long gainers. Grinnell is now 4-4
