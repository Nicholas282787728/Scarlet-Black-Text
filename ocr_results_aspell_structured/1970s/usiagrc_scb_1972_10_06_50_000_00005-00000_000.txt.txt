(Washington, n.c.)--wtien we dis
persed tor the summer last May,
one could confidently appraise the
Grinnell campus as a Confined or»
senel of McGovern supporters. Most
campuses were reporting a similar
unity oi purpose.

For many, it was the upheaval of
tour years oi impotence and anti-
cipation. it was the lermentation oi
a cause, There were the rumblings
oi the Democratic primaries fore—
boding the eruption of the student
vote.

Who would have expected such a
sudden disintegration oi unity and
exuberance? it is like the little boy
who, upon receiving birthday pre
sents, furiously explores them until
one runs down and he loses interest,
a sad tale tor a bunch of saga-
cious college students who should
realize the necessity to broaden
one’s base; to mold a cause into
a campaign that must galvanize some
45 million voters.

McGovern’s unpardonable mistake
was responding to his people’s faith
with concrete proposals on the mate
ters that have aggravated and stye
mied those people ior as long as
rve been around to be aggravated.

Washington
Report

People’s memories are so short
that they don’t recall what they have
been reaching toward ior iour years.

They don’t rewalk all the marches
that they knew were fruitless.

They don't rebuy all the items
and services which “used to be”
so much cheaper a,_iew yearsago,

They don't refeel the astonishment
and outrage at the blockade of Hair
phong Harbor.

They don’t reanalyze how they
themselves predicted that Nixon
would deescalate the war right be~
fore the election at the expense of
soldiers and civilians during the
interim.

They don't remember thatdissent-
ing college students were thegreat—
est single cause of the war's con—
tlnuation.

And they don’t resee all those doce
umentaries and pictures of the
maimed. the dead and the dejected.

All they see are McGovern's ace
onomic, military and educational
proposals that all of a sudden have
assumed the brunt of discontent.

i rechecked newpapers and journals
spanning the last four years and dis-
covered that McGovern was not the
President. It was a fellow named
Nixon who has since changed his
name to The President.

That's the same guy whose im-
peachment students clamoredfor
even realizing who the alternative
was,

That’s the same guy who, in 1961,
said- "This is not the time for em-
barking on huge new spending pro-
grams for domestic purposes, This
is a time to put America's secur—
ity and solvency tirst, There is no
question but that our expenditures
ior deiense, icr mutual security
abroad, ior space exploration. must
be sharply increased.”

That’s the same guy who, in 1972,

believes it is still not the time.
That’s the same guy who, ln1968,
said “The reason I favor the Oil
depletion allowance is that I do not
want us to tail behind ill developing
our oil resources,"

That's the same guy who, in 1968,
pledged “an administration where

those at the top will not give aid
and comiort to the lawbreakers in
America." That's the same guywho
harbors aides with transmitter
fetishes.

That‘s the same guy who, in 1962,
asked, “what are our schools for
it not for indoctrination against com-
munism?” That's the sameguy who,
seven years later, claimed that “in
every state the public schools are
literally the guarantee otthatstate's
lite and growth and health.”

That's the same guy who, in 1963,
promised "that ill were president,
i would give the vice president
major additional duties in helping
administer the domestic tunctions
of government. one oi the iirst of
these duties would be to involve
himself directly and personally in
this entire ettort to move govern.
ment closer to the people and to
make it more responsive,”

That’s the same guy who, in 1967,
said: “There must be strong, in»
dependenteminded men in the cabi-
net. They must be encouraged to
speak up and they must have power
in their own right.” That’sthe same
guy Wally Hickel and Robert Finch
believed.

That's the same guy who, in 1962,
proudly announced. “one ofthe great
marks of America is that we have
never in our history discontinued
political discussion, even when we
have been at war."

That’s the same guy who, in 1964.
said: ”Opposition to the war in this
country is the greatest single wea-
pon working against the US.“

And that’s the sameguy who, in
l969, perceived that "therehas been
and continues to be opposition to
the war in Vietnam on our cam-
puses. We expect it, However, un-
der no circumstances will I be
affected by it." And that’s the same
guy who has kept his word.

So, when; in 1968,‘ that ‘same guy
said: “Those who have had a chance
for four years and could not pro-
duce peace should not be given
another chance", why Shouldn't we
respond.

As students who have waited and
marched and pleaded for the op»
portunity to make a difference, now
is not the time to get squeamish
and lose faith.

Listen to a guy who has worked
with you for eight years as a Sena»
tor when he says that the students
who vote for Nixon don’t know which

way is "up”.

Soft Machine: The Early Years

by Scott Mason

The English rock scene has ale
ways struck me as being a bit more
creative than that in the united
states. Perhaps it is because they
are culturally removed trom the
sources oi rock that the Englishzire
continually able to produce music
that transcends or combines ItS
roots. On one extreme there are
the Stories; on the other end or the
spectrum there is Soft Machine, a
band that really has no rock coune
terpart in this country.

First heard warming up audiences
tor a production oi Desire Caught
By the Tail, Pablo Picasso's out-
rageious erotic work, the Soit Ma-
chine next made a record breaking

tour oi this country, playing back—
up to Jimi Hendrix in his first
appearance with the Experience

Their iirst album, Soft Machine,
made its appearance in 1967, and is
something of an underground mase
terpiece, Soft Machine was iormed
during the days of the rock trio:
Hendrix, Cream, Blue Cheer. At
its inception, the Machine, too, was
a trio, but with a diiterent twist,
they had no guitarist, but rather

 

 

 

 

l— Quortet Mixes Media

by David Crow

To a large and rather boorish aud-
ience, the Manhattan Quartet gave
its second concert of the season.
There was scattered applause aiter
the first movement of one piece,
and some people appeared to have
difficulty keeping still while the
quartet was playing, which i iound
most annoying.

Playing under these less than ideal
conditions, the Manhattan acquitted
itseli rather well, it unevenly. (i
say ”itself" because at their sup-
erior ensemble.) All through the
evening this uneveness was dis.
played It began with Mozart's Quar-
tet in a Major, K 453, The Hunt,
which started off with a good first
movement, and then a lousy second
movement, owing to substantial inr
tonation problems. Judith Glyde
sprang back with some magnificent
cello playing in the Adagio, and the
fourth movement came off about
like the first.

Then came the Kirchner' Quar—
tet No. 3 for Strings and Elece
tronic Tape, which left this reviewer
unimpressed, The lights went out,
save one, and it began, i tried to
allow tor my biases against this
sort of thing; but even at that, the
piece was, tor me. “A tale told
by (in idiot, full of sound and fury,
signiiying nothing." There seemed
to be little interface between the
tape and the quartet, and tape vol-
ume was sometimes askoch too

much, Frequently, the quartet was
lost in the shuffle, and I can only
say that, within the limits of the
genre, they played well,

After the intermission came what
I thought was the best effort of the
concert, namely the Quartet, Opus
44, No. l of Menelssohn The first
movement, Molto Allegro Vivace,
was in my opinion. brilliant. It wits
dramatic, it was taut, and it was
unified. But then came the Men~
uetto The playing here was posir
tively shaky, especially on the part
of the first Violin, Eric Lewis, A-
bout midway through the third move
ment, however,Mr. Leulisseemedto
get hold of himseli again, and re—
couped with playing lully up lothc
high standard he set in the first
movement. Tllc quartet finished with
a wellrexecuted fourth movement

What are we to make of this 05,
cillatmn? It seemed to me that
the group was too wound up. This
was emphasized when they stood
to receive applause: the expres
sions on their faces were really
grim l have a modest proposal to
make, 1 would like to suggest that
the group relax a little bit, even to
the point oi eincying themselves.
I believe that then their playing
would more consistently lie at the
levels they iiuvc shonnthemselves
capable oi. Also, this would con
tribute to that magic relationship
which sometimes builds up between
periormers and audience.

boards, Robert Wyatt on drums,
and Kevin Ayers (later llugh l-lope

their instrumentation, was unique.
From the verybeginning,theirdrive
was to synthesize the sounds Chan
and rock in an electronic context.
They were not afraidoistrangerhye
thms and unusual chord pror
gressions at a time when most
other bands were still playing oti
blues changes. Robert Wyatt’s
vocals were an integral part oi the
music, combining his truly unique
voice with some oi the strangest
and mast beautiiul lyrics i have
ever heard.

Soft Machine Volume II remains
an undiscovered masterpiece of
rock music. It was one of the most
complex albums to appear in 1968,
complex enough to make me put
it down aiier two listenings Each
side is conceived as a suite, an
uninterrupted series of songslinked
by instrumental improvisation.
Though they still played as a trio,
Volume II reflects Soft Machine's
growing musical maturity in its
extensive overdubbing of horns and
keyboards The recording is ex-
cellent, each instrument standing
out clearly; it's sad that both this
album and Soft Machine are very
difficult to find (lily more in this
country.

Side l begins with “A Concise
British Alphabet,” a symphonic-
like recitation of the alphabet that
preludes the closest thing to hard
rock Soft Machine ever did, "Hie
bou. Anemone, and Bear.” The song
deals with boredom and madness as
the alternatives in llfe:

In “Hibou” is the essence of Soft

Machine's poetic message, a mes—
sage that is chieiiy the conception
of Robert Wyatt. His songs reveal
his frustration at the impediments
contained in the mundanltles of life,
yet simultaneously admit their sur-
iace importance, and his own pre»
occupation with them (witness "Why
Am I So Short"" on the first 31‘

electronic textures of sound super»

Wyatt, despite his fine drumming,
is preoccupied with voice, melody,
and lyric, while the chief focus of
Ratledge and Hopper is with the

music itself, the sound and the

this direction, as can be seen in

the following three albums; Wyatt's
dissatisfaction with this trend re-
sulted in his leaving Soft Machine
