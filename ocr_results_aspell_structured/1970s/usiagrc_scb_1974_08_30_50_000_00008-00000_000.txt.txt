Water polo organized

Water polo, one of the toughest
Sports around, is back at Grinnell
in a big way this year, Instead of
the loosely-structured interest
group with two or three inter~
school contests that it was last
year, the sport has risen to become
a club with a fullstlme coach and a
iairly extensive schedule,

status in swimming while at
Grinnell. He still holds three fresh-

Introduced to water polo in 1969
as a Grinnell sophomore, he played
three years on the makeshift team.
With this preparation he was able
to compete in an organized league,

miller. Instead of the usual 15 or so
runners out, Obermiller has been
limited to only nine serious runs
ners, oi whom two are injured.

The big story in cross country,
however, is that the term “cross
country" no longer implies just
men. With this year’s
revolutionary movement into
women's intercollegiate sports, six
dedicated women are out for the
squad, All oi the women out have
done some running betore and they
look tough.

Like every good coach, Daley
looks ahead to the season with a
good deal oi anticipation and faith
in his players. “If we get between
10 and is players,” he commented
Wednesday afternoon, “we’ll be in
very good shape because we’ll be

Daley would like to emphasize
that water polo is a coeducational
sport, open to the entire Grinnell
community. Games will fall bets

Martmek sees grid hope

by Dave Calvert

Grinnell has picked up three new
coaches this year-rRon Mitchell
(see last week’s S 8' B), Donna
Mack (see next week’s S & B, and
John Martinek (keep reading).
Mortinek is really only a part-time
coach, his principal duties lalling
in the field of biology.

Martinek was secured through
the new Rush pre-med program
and will be instructing in anatomy.

His weekday afternoons, however,
will be devoted to filling the role of
offensive backfield football coach.

Ne’tmen fail
to conquer

by John Lom

In what was very similar to a
balloon exploding from too much
hot air, the Grinnell College Tennis
team terminated its season with a
noiseless pop. What turned out to
be one of their best dual match
seasons, in which the netmen won
seven of twelve matches, the
Pioneers almost fell into the bot-
tom depths of the Midw‘est Con-
lerenee Championships.

At the season finale in Cedar
Rapids, the Pioneers were only
able to reach the Semi-finals in the
no, 1 singles, no. 4 singles, and no.1
doubles competitions. The major
point makers were senior Brad
Vazales (no. 1 singles and
doubles), freshman Dan Edwards
(no.4 singles), and fourryear man
Neil Trabich (no. 1 doubles).

It was apparent that the
Pioneers went into the conference
meet with overrarnbitious hopest
They were too smug and over
conlident, but they quickly showed
that they were only brittle old

Let's hope that the new crop of
Pioneer netmen will be made from
a different and more successful
recipe.

Russ Damtoft and Paul Kennedy.
Some depth may be found in
sophomores John Chambers and
Lincoln Marshall.

The biggest rub for Obermiller is
that only two lreshmen have seen
lit to come out. This is apparently,
according to Obermiller, because
the expansion of football has drawn
away some potential runners, and
because many freshmen are
reluctant to commit themselves to
a sport as time consuming as cross
country this early in their
academic careers,

Obermlller, also head of
academic advising on campus, is
eloquent in his support of extra
curricular activities for every
student, and encourages anyone
interested in running to consider
cross country as an appropriate
activity.

While admitting that “it‘s a little
discouraging not having more
lreshman support," Obermiller is
quick to affirm his confidence in
the team has got. “I'm still op-
timistic,” he said in a Wednesday
interview, “We’ve got excellent
quality. Most of our runners have
run a considerable number of

miles this summer. We should do
fairly well."
The Women
For the women, also coached by
Obermiller, all seems well. Not
only is the turnout for the squad

larger than might have been ex- ,

peeled, but several very fine
runners are in the line up. Two
freshmen. Lisa Klose fro
olympia Heights, 111., an
Christine Stiedley from someplace
in Minnesota, seem to be moving
into positions at team leadership.
' The other four women, however,
are also experienced and cons
fident. They are Judy
Wiegal,Bertie and Laurie August,
and Marian Stevick. Because
women do not run the four and five
mile courses that men run, one and
a half and two’mile distance tilts
are being arranged by Coach
Obermiller.

coincide with men’s meets, and

most valuable player last year.
Elam, a Senior, was chosen last
october to represent Grinnell on

football as starting quarterback,

As a sophomore he led his squad
to the conference championship,
and as a senior cocaptain he very
narrowly missed turning the trick
again. “We missed by eight
seconds,” groans Martinek. “That
was one oi the low points of my
life." Martinek was, however,
named to the All Conference team
for his quarterbacking skills in his
senior year.

TlllancUllivcrsity

Not content with just a 13.5. irom
Whitewater State, Martinek moved
on to Tulane University, where he
studied anatomy. He emerged
from Tulane after tour years
with a Ph.D, Football at Tulane?
“Sure, we had the championship
intramural football team for the
whole University,”

Martinek went right on to Ohio
State, where they have a pretty,
fair football team of their own, and
served as an Assistant Professor
for five years. No football in-
volvement there, however.

Football opened back up for
Martinek with his appointment at
Grinnell this year, and he’s glad to
be here. Sharing much of the op-
timism flowing from all sides of the
Phys. Ed. department these days,
Martinek is impressed with the
hustle and enthusiasm of this
year’s football squad,

‘Clean Slate'

“Everybody‘s putting out and
working hard,” he declared earlier
this week. “Those who are back
are sick and tired of taking it, and
those just entering the program
are used to winning. In a way,” he
added, “it's good not to have a lot
at returning lettermen, since we
can kind of Wipe the slate Clean.“

As for individual offensive
prospects ior this year, Martinek is
very high on two freshmen
quarterbacks Paul Crane and
Randy Ravis. He praises both as
“good ballhandlers and good
throwers” and rates their in
dividual chances of starting as a
toss-up. As far as other offensive
backs, Paul Delaney, Walter
Pearcey, and Tom Goetz are likely
starters, although Martmek gives
sophomore Greg Lee a shot at the
tullback position.

The overall picture for football
this year appears good, and much
of the creditmnst go to thefine new
coaches Grinnell has picked up. 1t
would seem the only ingredient not
yet here for a winning football
team is strong fan support, and
there is no reason to doubt that will
come on opening day, Saturday,
September 14, right here at Ward
Field, against Coe,
