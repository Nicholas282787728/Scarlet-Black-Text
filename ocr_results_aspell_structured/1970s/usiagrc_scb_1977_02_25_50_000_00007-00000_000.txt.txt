Women

Six women have advanced to
national competition as the
women's Swim team has concluded
regular sea son action. In defeating
Augustana 89-38 this past Satur-
day, the women closed their season
with a 4-0 dual meet record, Other

hlights included first place
fishes in the Miracle Relays and
Iowa College Relays.
Coach Mike Daley expressed
satisfaction with the year, stating,
(his was the best women's team

rinnell has ever had.” As
evidence, he pointed to the fact
that 26 of 39 school and pool records
fell during the season, Against
Augustana 10 records were either
tied or broken Kathy Keller and
Nancy DuTeau both collected two
individual victories to pace the win
over the visitors Irom Rock Island,
Ill.

Keller‘s best chance in national
Competition should be in the 100
yard breaststroke, while Daley
gives Margo Wessner a good

hance at placing in the 200
ékstroke. Omers competing in

tercollegiate Athletics for

Clarion, Pen , will be Renee
Reichart, Virginia Munoz, Sheryl
Huntoon, and Becky Chipman.

Reviewing the season, Daley
commented, “Personally and
individually their (the swimmers)
personalities have developed in
positive ways . . The swimming
program has been a positive in-
fluence on peoples’ lives.” The
program has come a long way in
the three years that Daley has been
coach. “The workouts have gotten
harder (4,500 yards averaged per
day as compared with 3,200 yards
three years ago) and more records
have been broken each ywr,” said
Daley.

While Cindy Smith is the only
swimmer that will be lost to
graduation, the future of the

program is in doubt as Daley may .

not return to the college next year,
About the future Daley would only
say, “If I do leave 1 just hope that
they find someone who is a swim
coach . . , The people who will be
here and those that will .come
deserve this.”

The Grinnell women’s basketball
team completed their season
Monday night wth a loss to the
William Penn J.V., finishing with
an o7 record. Even though this
record and the scores of the games
were unimpressive, they do not

Aally reflect what happened
ring the course of the year.

From the beginning the team
lacked experience, familiarity
with one another, height, and

th. Furthennore, they faced

orients who surpassed their
level of play. The first game
against Upper Iowa resulted in a
634K) loss, the closest though not
the best-played game of the year.
The team had good outside
shooting and a fairly strong
defense, yet they lacked stamina
and a more consistent fast break.
In the second game against the
Central J.V., the Pioneers lost 72»
39, once again exhibiting a

adic defense, due to a lack of
endurance,

After winter break, it was ap

t that Grinnell would lose
teir remaining games, but the
.women retained a positive attitude
and tried to play at their optimal
level. In the third game, once again
against Central, the Pioneers lost
86732. Against Graceland, Grinnell
lost 74735,. In both games the
women lacked equilibrium in the
shooting and the scoring as
Stephanie Nelson was forced to
carry most of the offensive load.

The next two games against the

 

Luther J.V, and the William Penn
J.V. were the high marks of die
season. In both games the Pioneers
scored 43 points, the highest total
ever accumulated by a Grinnell
women‘s basketball team. They
exhibited their offensive
capabilities by reducing a 14 point
deficit tu6 in a period of two-andar
half minutes, Against William
Penn, Grinnell played their best
game by preventing their taller
and faster opponents from
breaking away.

Last Monday, in their last game
against William Penn, the team
lost 73-29, as they failed to
penetrate their opponent‘s delense
and gave up points radily,

During the season, the women
gained valuable experience and
skill, Their stamina increased to
the point where several players
remained in games [or the entire
40 minutes. As a team there were
marked improvements in passing,
dribbling and shooting, as they
grew more poised and [amiliar
with each other. Individually, the
team leading scorer for the season
was Stephanie Nelson with 69
points, followed by Chris Stidley
and Kim Krutilla each with 55.

According to coach Winkler
there is “lots of room for im-
provement, it the attitude remains
positive." She commented on the
“selfrimprovement at the Skill
level,” which gave the women the
positive motivation to explore and
enhance their potentials.

men to conference

opening of the Midwest Conference

meet one week from today. Team
workouts have decreased in
yardage and increased in in-
tensity; the stress is on speed
rather than endurance. One home
meet remains, tomorrow afternoon
at 12:30 pm. against Carleton and
Coe.

In the past week Lawrence,
Ripon, and Cornell fell by large
margins to the Pioneels, None of
these teams provided much
competition [or Grinnell, all losing
by margins of 25-50 points. This
gave coach Ray Obermiller a
chance to experiment and solidify
his line-up for the conference
championships.

Tomorrow's meet marks the
final home competition for several
swimmers, Those graduating from
this year's team are cocaptains
John Chambers and Doug
Johnson, Kent Ramsey, and Dave
Schechter. Others not expecting to
return next year include Bob
Nourse and Randy Craig,

Two members of the team.
Chambers (in the butterﬂy) and
Norm Zimmerman (diving) have
qualified for the NCAA Division III
championships to be held at
Oberlin College during spring
break, It is hoped that several
others will qualify either tomorrow
or during next week's conference
championships at Iowa City.

Offense
shines

by Mike Salsich and
, Caleb Sullivan

The men’s varsity basketball
team lost their 19th and 20th
games, falling to Cornell on
Saturday (97784) and lowa
Wesleyan on Tuesday (9cm),

According to official statistics of
all the colleges and universities in
Iowa, Grinnell, with a record of o
20, holds the worst defensive
record. giving up 99.6 points per
game.

However. this record is. not
reflective of some moderate
achievements. For example, the
Grinnell team has the second best
offense in the league, with 36.9
points per game. Amidst the
frustrations and disappointments
of a \vinless season, Grinnell
boasted the second and tenun
ranked scorers in the league (Paul
DeLaney and Carl Warner) and a
consistently well balanced offense.

The JV basketball team took on
Cornell’s JV and lost the contest by
a score of 33-71. The Pioneers led at
the half, 39-38, but were outscored
in the second frame, 45-32. Jon
Chazen led all scorers with 19, Joe
ngma had 18, and Jeff Green-
berg 10.

Support for the varsity’s final
game would be much appreciated
and well deserved. The game Will
be played this coming Saturday at
l p.m, in Darby Gym

Grapplers
psyche up

by Bob Meyer

Last Saturday, the Grinnell
wrestlers lost a close match to
Carleton, Coach Mo Hunt felt that a
couple particular matches stole the
momentum and enabled Carleton
to squeeze by, 26-17.

The matches that Coach Hunt
relerred to were wrestled by
Richard Lee (158) and Harvey
Peguos (hvyt.) Lee fought the third
period of his match trailing and his
opponent stalled so that Lee's
opportunity for victory would be
extinguished. Pegues, fighting the
ﬁnal match With the team trailing
by six points, was forced to aim for
the pin, His change of strategy
proved risky as he lost the match 7-
3.

Grinnell wrestled strongly in the
light weight class. David Green-
wald (118) won a superior decision

(5 pts.), co-captain Gordon Staceyi

(134) won a major decision (4 pm),
and Frank Corrigan (150) won by
decision (3 pts.)

Grinnell is ranked sixth out of
nine teams in this weekend‘s
Midwest Conference, to be held at
Ripon College, Hunt is confident
that Grinnell will outrscore
Carleton and most likely fair better
than Ripon, and hopes to capture a
third or fourth place overall.

Men’s quad

by Tim DeCoster

Defending conference champion
Coe easily beat three other teams
last Friday as Grinnell hosted
another indoor track meet. Cor“
743/4 ts allowed them to defeat

(Centr (53%) and William Penn
‘ (25%). Grinnell was fourth with 25
l points.

The Pioneers once again put on

‘ their “Heave , H0” act in the shot
put. “Heave” (freshman Tom
Briles) won the event With a toss of
46’ 101/4”, the same'distance as his;
winning put last week. ”Ho”
(sophomore Dave Leech) was
second, about two and a half feet
short of Briles's mark, and over a
foot ahead of the third place

’ finisher.

Grinnell’s only other victory was
captured by senior Lincoln Marc
shall in the triple jump, Marshall‘s
distance of 43' 5%” was about a
foot and a half further than Cen-
tral’s second-place jump.

Sophomore Tim Caver and
junior Greg Neighbors each pulled
in second places for the Pioneers.
Caver was second in the 660yard
dash and Neighbors was runnerrup
in the pole vault.

One dim point in coach John
Pfitsch‘s plans is the injury suf-
fered by Glenton Davis in the
opening meet. Piitsch is hopeful
that Davis, one of the team’s top
sprinters, will be back in action in
time for the Midwest Conference
meet next week in the PEG.

Women’s
dual

Last Friday, in an unscored dual
meet, Central College outclassed
the Grinnell woman’s track team
[or the second time. Despite
Central‘s obvious dominance, the
Pioneers exhibited a good team
effort and an overall improvement
in their individual events.

Sue Henken jumped 13 feet, a
personal best, to capture second
place in the long jump. Kim
Krutilla placed third in the 220yd.
dash with a time of 30.2. Janice
Tave also took third in the 440 yd.
dash with a time of 70.0. The
Pioneers 880 yd. relay team,
comprised of Mary Jo Ladu, Cathy
Gillis, Sue Henken. and Laurie
Cragei took third place, and im-
proved their previous time by
three seconds.

According to coach Dick Van
Scotter, the team lacks experience
and depth and therefore has to
“work hard to be competitive." He
is optimistic about the upcoming
Grinnell Invitational on March 12,
saying, “until then they will just be
grinding away.”
