station, is experiencing a resurgence
in participation. Various changes in
FCC regulations have created a new
interest in KDIC and sparked recent
innovations.

ioi‘ts in the Carter White House to
eliminate red tape, now allows potenr
tial disc jockeys tDJslto obtain broad-

“instant" licenses, flooded KDIC With
requests ior shows this iall, causing

everyone could get a show ..We
thought about going to huur-and~a»hali
shows and in that way using twice the
DJS, but that would have destroyed
continuity. Next semester we hope to
please more people,"
