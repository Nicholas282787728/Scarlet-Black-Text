move further south of the border,
from Dixie to Guatamala, as Grinnell
welcomes R011 Hudson to South
Lounge for 3:30 and 10:30 Saturday
evening performances. His repertoire
includes everything from classical to ,
Latin to contemporary music.

In addition to perrorming, Hudson
will host a workshop for, as Perform»
ing Programs and Activities Counselor
Georgia Dentel pum it, ”whoever
wants to come and learn how to play
guitar, or play it better,"

Born in the small Indian village of
Cohen, in the mountains of northern
Guatamala, Hudson received his first
musical training from his missionary
parents. It was there he learned to
play guitar and several other musical
instruments, including piano, organ,
and marimba, and picked up his ap-
preciation of the rich musical
background of his native land

At the age of 17, Hudson came to the
United States, where he continued his
musical education in Oklahoma and at
the University of Texas, After being
“discovered” by the consulate general
of Guatamala in 1970, he toured exten-
sively throughout the us, Canada,
Europe, and Latin America. Hudson
regularly visits 80 to 100 American
schools each year.

Hudson’s concerts rlast approximate—
ly two hours, during which he mixes
his music with a variety of anecdotes
on his experiences in Guatamala.

A typical program includes such
numbers as Scarborough Fair.
Classical Gas, traditional
Guatamalean and Spanish iolk songs,
and pieces trom Jesus Christ
Superstar and J.S. Bach.

A highlight of the concert promises
to be his performance of the first

last four years transcribing this com-
position for the guitar.

Because of Hudson's wide
background of musical knowledge,
guitarists of all types and abilities are
encouraged to attend the workshop.

Though not scheduled to do so at Grins -

nell, Hudson also speaks to Spanish

Hudson is currently touring on the L ,
heels of the release of his fourth I
album of Spanish and classical music
Various press blurbs promise an in- ~
teresting and entertaining concert by
this exceptional instrumentalist.

Takea tension-filled study break

Suspense and intrigue characterize
this week‘s film Committee choices.
Sorcerer (1977) is the story of how
tour men risk their lives and why they
were willing to; and Knife in the
Water (1962) is Roman Polanski’s ins
triguing study of the conﬂicts between
three people spending the weekend on
a sailboat.

William Freidkin’s Sorcerer starts
slowly by giving the audience lots oi
background inrormation on the main
characters, This is necessary to ex
plain why they are willing to assume
the risks they do once the main plot
gets established (whlch doesn’t until
the movie is half over).

What happens is an oil well in an

underdevelolped nation is sabotaged
and the workers need nitro-glycerine
to put out the fire that results. The On-
ly problem is that the explosives are
200 miles away and have been
mistreated in such a way that the only
safe way to move them is by truck.
Driving two hundred miles over
treacherous mountain roads (with
more than one dilapidated bridge)
doesn't strike anyone, especially the
drivers, as terrifically safe, but our
protagonists volunteer to do it
anyway.

Freidkin's fine direction and John
M. Stephens’ and Dick Bush's
camerawork give the last part of the
film a haunting, eerie quality which
