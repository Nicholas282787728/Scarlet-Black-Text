New CSL structure may abridge
SGA’ s social policy role

by Anne Rowland
'i‘his weekend SGA President
Greg Youtz, Dean of Student Afr
fairs Jim Tederman and senior
Rob Henak plan to draw up a
proposal which would probably
exclude Joint Board from the
social policy making process,
Under the new structure Joint
Board would still be responsible for
appointing student CSL members.
SGA would also be given some sort
iof power to remove student CSL
members However, CSL
proposals Would go directly to the
president of the college without
Joint Board action
THIS PROPOSED compromise
Came after sometimes heated
discussion of two reorganizational
plans. one written by Tederinan,
the other by Henak.
, Youtz said, “It will be a policy no
one will be happy With but that's
the essence of compromise.”

AA guidelines released

by Bob Mitchell

In an effort to remove “Short
comings and ambiguities,"
Kenneth C. Browning has revised
the college‘s affirmative action
policy.

Tile new guidelines, deviscd by
Browning last semester and
released to faculty and Staff last
week, now extends to all employees
of the college. They have been
approved by the Affirmative
Action Advisory Committee,
President A Richard Turner,
Dean of the College Waldo Walker,
and the college’s legal advisors.

l

it‘s all»
the

judge the success of
fii'mative action efforts,
guidelines said

“In establishing these minimum
and more challenging aspirations
this program establishes a Starr
(lard by which nlembers of the
college community may judge the
success of the affirmative action
efforts,” the document says,

This year 21.5 per cent of the
college's faculty are women and
4.5 percent are classes as minority.

Grinnell, however, should strive
to go beyond these minimum goals,
the report said.

Current status of AA

by Bunny Neff .

“We have to know where we
are," Said Vice Provost and Af-
firmative Action Officer Kenneth
C. Browning, referring to the 1978-
79 Grinnell College Status Report
on Women and Minority Emr
ployees, which he issued Feb. 14

The report, which for the first
time covers all people who work
for the college, divides the em-

The guidelines amend an earlier
affirmative action program drawn
up in April 1977, and cover hiring,
retention, promotion and tenure
policy for faculty, hiring, retention
and promotion policy for the
professional staff and support staff
and the administration of the af-
firmative action program.

A minimum goal for faculty

' hiring, the guidelines say is that
the number of Women and
minorities on the faculty match the
pergemage of female or minority
doctorates or equivalent degrees
within a certain field, This means
the college’s minimum goal should
be “not less than” 20 percent
female and three percent minority.
the report says.

The guidelines also establish
“more challenging aspirations”
which call for 25 percent of the
faculty to be female and five
per to have minority
background withing the next five
years.

These minimum standards will
allow the college community to

 

develop full

ployees into five categories: the
regular faculty, the protessional
staff, other faculty, the support
staff, and resident advisors.

IN THE TEACHING faculty,
women hold 24 of the 111 positions,
or 21.6 per cent as compared to
last year’s 2m per cent. Although
this reveals almost no change in
the number of women faculty

(continued on page 2)

“The college should aspire to do
better, that is, to be a model not of
the world as it is, but of a world
with less race discrimination and
less sex discrimination that in
contemporary American society."

Each department is also
required under the new guidelines
to “actively seek" women and
minority candidates for new
positions by:

stating the college’s interest in
hiring women and minority can
didates when sending graduate
departmens notices of openings;

contacting women and minority
groups within professional
asSociatiutls; and

getting in touch with persons who
know potential female and
minority candidates.

In screening candidates, the
guidelines require “extra
resources, ,be expended to
information on
promising Women and minority
candidates including those.

The guidelines say the Dean of
the College must notify the af~
firmativc action officer of any
departmental recommendation for
a position and the affirmative
action officer must present any
leasons for objecting to a can-
didate in writing the executive
council and the Affirmative Action
Committee,

The college also needs to in-
crease the number of women and
minorities among tenured faculty.
the report says, and “this need
may more than outweigh” other
consideration.

The college must pursue this
tenure policy, the guidelines say,
even though it poses a financial
risk.

“The extra financial risk implied
in this commitmentithe
willingness to risk something in
financial flexibility and perhaps to
incur some costs through
decreased curricular ﬂexibility in
order to retain fully qualified
women and minorities—is part of
the college‘s financial comr
mitment to affirmative acu'on."

The guidelines also say the
college’s goal for its professional
staff is to “have women and
minorities as well as white males
at all levels.”

In searching for new staff per
sonnel, the college may wish to
look internally or externally the
report says, a decision outside the
school is appropriate when
there are no women or minority
candidates among current em-
ployees.

During an external search, job
supervisors should “actively seek
women and minority candidates”
and employ referral services
which concentrate on handling

. women and minorities

Searches are not required “when
it is clear that the promotion
recognizes the growth of a person
or expansion of a job," the report

‘ says.

In selecting support staff emr
players, “the guidelines call for
“serious consideration" to be
given to “promising” minority
candidates and applicants for

 

who, on the basis of limited initial
information, do not rank as high as
some white males.”

positions dominated by members
of the opposite sex.

ORIGINALLY. Tcderman's
policy included four changes.
These are
.adding students and faculty to
tllc committee to raise the number
ofstudents from six to nine and the
numbei‘of faculty from two to four.
The student members would
henceforth be elected by the
student body,

.specifying the president or vice
president of the SGA as one of the
members;

.rcmoving the Joint Board input
by having CSL approved policies
go directly to the president of the
college.
callowing the committee to vote
without going into executive
session.

llciiak‘s proposal appeared to
suggest structural changes
diametrically opposed to Tederr
man's. His policy dealt more
power to SGA by allowing Joint
Board to remove a student
member by twfirthlrds vote of the
hall or sidcnts. any CSL-amended
proposals to go back to Joint Board
as new proposals, and Joint Board
to initiate social policy proposals.

TEDER. V CLAIMED that the
faculty wa h't well enough
represented, prompting him to
recommend enlarging the com»
mittee. l-le justified the need to

 

increase the number of students to
maintain a student major' y on the
committee. “I was the one who got
the students to be in the ma yoi-ity in
the first place. I feel it's important
that students have the most say,"
he said,

At the same time, Tedcrman
,cited the present committee

structure as being too slow in
decision-making “i believe our
present structure is too cum»
bersome and time consuming," he
‘said. “I think We should stieamline
iour decisio' -making process. “

\ios’r \ll- Mucus stated that
-he faculty was already fairly
represented, and that adding more
oeople would only cause problems
.inding meeting times and It would
also hinder group decisionmaking.
English professor James Kissane
said, “A larger committee would
bcvtoo uniiicldy. Getting nlore
people involved is not the way to
get the faculty involved."

AT LEAST ONE administrative
representative spoke in favor of
electing students atrlarge instead
of having them appointed, Director
of |he Physical Plant Dale Hawn
said, “If the student body sees the
CSL as important as the Joint
Board. thcnthcy possibly should be
