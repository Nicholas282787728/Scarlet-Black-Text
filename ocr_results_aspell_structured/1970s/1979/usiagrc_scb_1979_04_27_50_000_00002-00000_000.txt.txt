The Ultice of Student Financial
Aid has instituted a new policy to
IllCltdse lhc :imounl of \i’Ol‘k'study
aid in students aid packages ior
noxi rcar

"It's not a terribly liig change."
said Director oI Admissions and
Financial Aid John Hopkins in
explaining the policy which will
aiicci approximately lOtJ students.

“UPI-(INS siun rule change
Came after the college failed lo
pass an audit of its financial aid
hooks last year The college mler~
awarded somC students on
linunmal aid and it Showed up
when auditors, hii‘Cd annually by
thc college, were removing the
books as part oi meeting obli-
gations tor the federal governe
iiient.

in the past, the college awarded
aid on a priority basis, It tried first
to award grants to students, then
made lotiii arrangements. and
then. it necessary added some
workrstudy aid. As a result of this
policy. the college did not give out
its full amount of workrstudy
money allotted to it by the Office of
Education,

FOR ANY institution that
receives iedcral money, lailure to
spend the allotment is taboo. When
the Office of Education noted
Grinnell had not given the money
to students, it cut this year's
budget by the amount the college
had not used.

Overawarding came about when
students on aid, who also worked in
campus jobs. were paid amounts
which put them above what was
calculated as their need

WHAT IT AMOUNTEI) to was
that the college was paying
financially aided students out of its
own pocket when it could have
been using iederal workstudy
money to pay them,

Under the new policy, the college
will be using all oi its work-study
money. “We will end all oi our
money this year." Hopkins said.
Further. the College will try to
award financial aid beyond the
amount allotted to the aid office, in
order to Show the Oifice of
Education that it will need an in
crease tor the ioliowtn'g year.

WHAT DOES THE new policy

mean for the 100 or more students.

who will be on some amount oi
viorkrstudy aid? Hopkins and
associate director or admissions
and iinancial aid nick Vos con»

will be involved in some kind oi

concerning the total effect of the

Hopkins responded that six to

has seen shows that students on
Workrstudy are better organized
because they know their time is
precious.

iiNO'l‘llER CONCERN is the
question .ot studcnt preicrcncc.
Some students would rather not
it ol‘k. but instead receive their aid
in the form of loans. Vos said low»
interest loans are very attractive
to students with great need.

The mathematics of these loans
is simple, Students can borrow

This points out a third problem.
What if a student works too much"
Under the rules of lilorkrstudy, if a
Student reaches the limit of liilecr
allotment. ihcn’ hershc must
stop working. But Vos said that
adyustments could he made so that
some oi the loan portion could be
transierred into the \vorkrstudy
category.

Vos added that this action could
be taken it. say. an employer like
the iood service ran intoa probl .
with some of its workers reaching
their limits in workrtime These
students could have their packages
adjusted to allow them to take
more pay. less loan.
