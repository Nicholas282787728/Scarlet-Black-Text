Editor Laurie Cragg and “In
stitutionalized Grapevine” staff
members slid questionnaires
under students' doors last Weds
naday as part of efforts to revive
the course-rating magazine.

THE GRAPEVINE question-
naire consists of 16 questions
evaluating the professor, seven
questions relating to requirements
in the course, and three questions
comparing the course to other
course offerings.

The Grapevine is designed to
evaluate course work and faculty
performance. It createsa listof the
amount of work required in the
course and also includes in-
structors' commens on how the
course format may be changed.

Cragg has introduced several
new features for this year’s
edition. There will be no
publication unless a minimum of 65
percent of the student body
responds.

In addition, course evaluations

imore realistic and helpful to

will include sections specifying the
number of students who dropped »
the course, and the work load will .
be detailed quantitatively.

CRAGG SAID THE publication
faces a number of serious obs
stacles, .

“The biggestproblem, of course,
is getting enough student response
and overcoming the prejudices
already formed against the
Grapevine. Also, we have no
student access to official course
evaluations," she said.

“We’re running on a tight budget
from SGA. We’ll either have to
charge students for the magazine
or limit copies to one per dorm. I’m
also short of staff and would apr
preciate volunteers," she said.

NONETHELESS, SHE is 0}}
timistic about the Grapevine‘s
chances of success.

“What we‘re going to come out
with is a general overview of
courses rather than a biased
viewpoint, and I think it will be

Grapevme returns to campus

students trying to choose the right
courses and get the kind of
education they want."

IN 1977, FACULTY members
registered a protest with SGA
against Grapevine, alleging that
editors were “soliciting spiteful
remarks” and evaluations were
“likely to be inconclusive,"
Student response in the following
year was so low that the editor
cancelled publication.

But Ron Kurtz, chairman of the
faculty, said Cragg's innovations
will improve the publication.

“WHILE I AGREE with the

previous criticism of Grapevine, I
feel that some of these changes will
considerably improve its quality."
Since Jack Doppelt launced
Grapevine in 1973, the
publication has declined in terms
of Volume and attracted fewer
student responses. In 1975, the
response rate to Grapevine
questionnaires was 55 percent,
while in 1977 it was 27 percent.

Charges involving KDIC dropped

by Dan Flynn

As a result of last semester's
controversy at KDIC, the Student
Publications and Radio Committee
will attempt to clarify the station's
operational policies and
procedures in an effort to avoid
future confrontations. ,

Last semester, charges and
counterrcharges between Station
Manager Kurt Anderson and
Communications Director Elliot
Pollack occupied the SP&R
agenda.

Eventually, the committee
decided to drop all of Pollack's 42
charges against station
management. Terry Walker,
faculty representative on the
committee, said the general
consensus of committee members
was that Pollack‘s charga were
minor.

“We felt that ﬂiey were minor
difficulties. or~in other cam‘
that they were things people were
trying to work on," she says.

KDIC adviser William
Deminoff adds that some of the
ideas in Pollack’s charng will be
considered when the committee
attempts to work out guidelines for
station operation, He said he hopes ,
these guidelines will increase
communication between staff
members ,

Walker Said this “should not be '
construed as a disapproval of
Kurt’s actions as manager. He has
brought about many im-
provements at the station."

She feels Pollack’s complaints
stem from his previous experience
with commercial radio stations.

“He doesn't understand that at a
lowatt station these things are
minor," she said,

Pollack said he is dlssappoinled
his charges were rejected, He feels
they are subslantive, even if KDIC
is a lD-watt station and thinks the

committee did not give adequate
consideration to his charges.

“I was led to believe that I was
going to be given a chance to
present evidence to support my
charges,“ he said. “Their dropping
the charges totally shocked me.”

He hopes affairs at the station
will improve this semester, and
says he Will continue to speak out
when he feels the need to.

While the committee members
did not reprimand Pollack as
Anderson had asked, they did
instruct Pollack to perform his job
“with a conscious effort at
cooperation.”

The problems at KDIC were seen
by many as merely a personality

 

conflict between Pollack and
Anderson. Anderson implied
agreement with this theory at a
SP&R meeting late last semester
when he suggested that, whatever
the results of the SPhR invatiga-
tion, it would be difficult for he
and Pollack to work on the same

staff,
Deminoff seems hopeful the two

can work out their disagreements
and work for the betterment of the
station.

“They both come from very
different backgrounds and have
different skills to offer the station.
I’m very confident that if they can
work together the station will be
better for it.” he said.
