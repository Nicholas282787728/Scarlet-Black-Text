Carter indecision hurts prestige

‘by Paui T. (‘artcr

Today, Grinnell students are
more concerned with academics
and their careers in
the years to come than current
evens.

But it's time now to take notice of
the events going on around us. For
the last three years. President
Jimmy Carter has brought
American prestige to a perilously
low point. The actions oi the
President are seen as a guide for
other countries as to how America
will act or react to various
situations. Because of Carter's
policies. the rest of the world views
the United States as quite in-
decisive. ‘

Why is prestige so important?
The answer lies in three pertinent
areas—econom . military. and
political support.

THE (‘LOl'T THAT tth.S. once
wielded in the Middle East. for
example. has slowly eroded away.
A case in point would be the
situation in Iran. President Carter
was. ill-informed about the

situation there. and thus handled it
poorly.

with loss of prestige and respect,
smaller countries are just not
willing to accept U.S. policy.
America needs oil. If asserting its
power protects the now of oil. then
so be it.

MILITARILV. THE U S. has not
responded to the Soviet buildup of
conventional weapons. Some might
argue that the US. should be a
paceselter in the reduction of arms

‘ production. But why are the

Soviets building up their weapons°
The answer can only be [or future
military contlicl.

Politically. Carter appeases
people rather than asserts his
authority. He stood in public and
let the Mexican President attack
the state oi U.S rMexican relations
by relerring to past injustices. The
human rights policy he initiated
was an honorable position to take.
but he has done little to enforce it
Jews in communist block countries
are not aided by the ad
ministration.

AMERICAN (‘REDIBILITY is
not as strong as it once was.
Today we may appear some-
what strbng and the ad-
ministration lries in project an
image of approaching problems in
a lhoughtlul way. ‘ But apr
pearances can be deceiving,

Two. three or to years trom now.
smaller Countries will think twice
betore accepting us. aid. They
might tear that the us. will not
support them. These countries will
turn somewhere else {or
assistance,

TIIE U NEEDS its allies to
remain st g. Being assertive is
necessary in a world where others
are testing one's cvery strength.

Strong leadership is needed at

this point in time. Clearly. the
present administration lacks the
backbone to handle problems,
Whether in the lulure American
leadership lied within the
Republican or Democratic parties
is a decision to be left to the
electorate in NOV. of 1980,
