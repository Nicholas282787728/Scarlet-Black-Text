studio in ARH 123 is feasible at this
time, but Verrette could'n’gt estimate
the cost. He said that a consultant
ii-om lowa city would be vis‘ ing Grin-
nell in the near tuture to give an
estimate on the cost oi repairing the
old equipment and the additional costs
for setting up a new studio, .

“There needs to be a staff of
students to take care of the studio,"
Verrette stated, “but it would also be
a good idea to have some workshops
for both students anti faculty
members. ”

Presently. no one at Grinnell has the
technical or practical experience to

take on the responsibility for a video
studio, The lacility needs to have proc
perly trained people who know the
correct procedures tor the use oi video
cameras and their maintenance, he

said.
With the moving or the equipment,

the Language Lab has taken on the
responsibility tor the equipment, ii a
student or faculty member wishes to
take out a piece at equipment, they
can contact the Language Lab and
sign it out.

One of the nlght attendants is con-
cerned about the present condition or
the equipment because attendants

don’t know about the correct pro
cedures ior setting up and running
most of the video cameras and
monitors “It is a real hassle, ” one
worker stated “When people come to
the lab to take out equipment 1 don i
always know ii we have it. "

It seems that because the equipment
is being moved to ARH to proVide
more ODDortunities for students and
faculty to use the equipment more easi-
ly, there must be a more eiiicient way
to keep track oi the equipment. The
main problem stems from the lack oi
available storage space in the
Language Lab

it you don t like concert movies, and
find that they are generally boring
and often have the worst music from
the Concert, then The Last Waltz is a
film you won‘t want to miss. Martin
Scorsese took a look at all the concert
movies which were nut at thd time and
decided that the problem was that
looking at a concert from the audience
is boring it you aren't part oi that au-
dience. The best way to do a concert
movie, he deClded, is to start out to
make a movie and invite people to
come listen to the music, instead of
going to Woodstock or Altamont. _'

If you couple this idea with the fact
that the Band was going to quit work-
ing and wanted to film their last con-
cert, you have The Last Walu. The
music is varied. from country to rock
and roll. and uniformly excellent. The
concert was at Winterland and
featured, among others, the Band,
Neil Diamond, Joni Mitchell, Muddy
Waters. Neil Young, Emmylou Harris.
Ringo Starr, The Staples, Paul Butter»
field, Van Morrison. Eric Clapton, and
Bob Dylan.

The cinematography is far superior
to that in any other concert movie to
date, The cameras were set up both on
the stage and in the audience, but _
most oi the shots are onstage or
backstage, There are also clips irom
Interviews shot for the movie intercut
with the music. The Band uses this op-
portunity to reminisce about the 16
years they spent on the road and
especially about the eight years they
spent playing in small clubs and bars.

This is a movie that anyone who
likes rock and roll should be sure to
see. Even it you don’t like concert
movies, give The Last Waltz a chance,
it might surprise you.—T.S.
