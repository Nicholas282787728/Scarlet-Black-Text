 

An Excuse
for Existence

Cynics’ dreams vanish

Against the backdrop

of a hard Chicago winter evening,

The commuters trample their dreams

And leave morning newspapers

Scattered an the emplt train seats

For the porter lo pick up and throw
away.

They get off the train at cardboard
houses,

Where their minds turn off and on

With the changing of the television

channel.

The nightly news is on so frequently,

—Mary Spengler

The spot-
light on you

It's all a joke
Give you enough rope
And you'll hang yourself.
Play thls game
Search for fame
You'll fool yourself.
Believe the dream
Hearing children scream
You'll blind yourself.
Sign on the line
Pay out the fine
You'll cage yourself.
Close the door
Hang on the floor
You'll enrege yourself.

— Brian Howell
