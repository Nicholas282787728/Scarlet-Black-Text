raise awareness about these issues
and to generate publicity.

in November, the group participotrd
in a demonstration at Iowa’s only
nuclear power plant at Palo. The Palo
plant had been Closed for repairs. The
demonstration was held to demand
that it not be reopened and to support
workers in a labor disqute over saiety
at the plant. With money raised from
student government sources and bake
sales, about 30 people from Grinnell
attended. ,

A second, larger rally concerning
the Palo plant took place on April 21 in
Cedar Rapids. About 25 people went
under the sponsorship or both Mobe
and (IPIRG),

Rawland thinks that Mobe ac
complished the goal of establishing
itself as an active, working group on
campus last year. Evidence oi this is
the amount of controversy Mobe has
raised and the presence or debate over
their Activities in the S & B and
elsewhere

Prospecb for next year look good, if
one goes by the large turnout at an
open house held last Sunday by Mobe
and IPIRG. Rawland predicts that the
emphasis this year will probably be on
nuclear power, which seems to be the
main interest of this year’s group, The
group has yet to discuss its goals and
decide on a focus of activity.

IPIRG is a much older organization
at Grinnell. It describes itself as a
“Naderish” group that gets involved
in a variety of environmental, con-
sumer, and energy issues, IPIRG is a
statewide organization, and there are
similar “PIRGS” working in many
states. The group at Grinnell has a
budget that comes from a $2 fee that
members can pay with their tuition,

Late last year, 1?ch sponsored a
panel discussion with members of the
college community about the use oi
energy on campus. It involved Vice
Provost Ken Browning, the head of the
heating plant, and others. rtaised at
the discussion were questions about
energy ineiiicient buildings on campus
and what can be done about them.

The possibility of the college ex-
perimenting with solar and wind
power was largely rejected the by ad
ministration says Stephany Sanborn,
this year’s IPIRG coordinator.
However, she says they were more
responsive to other suggestions. An
energy committee has been establish-
ed on campus by the administration,
partly as a result oi student (IPIRG)
interest, One student sits on the com-
mittee.

This year about 40 new ireshmen
and transfer students have expressed
an interest in IPIRG. Sanborn is ops
timistic and predicts that this year
heavy emphasis will be placed on
alternative energy sources.

Last year, Mobe and iPIRG had
many members in common and the
two groups worked together on several

August 3i 1979

projects. However, it must be said
that the groups are distinct in
character and emphasis. From the
looks of it, there may be more
divergence this year between them.

Both organizations try to focus on
issues about which something can he
done and both seek greater awareness
of various problems and their soluv
tions.

One main difference between them
seems to be that IPIRG focuses on
getting action from local bodies, such
as the Iowa Legislature, the Grinnell
City Council, or the college ad
ministration, while Mobe pursues

more sweeping national reforms.

IPIRG has a history of taking un-
conventional causes and convincing
those in positions oi power that they
are reasonable and sensible. To do
this, Sanborn emphasized the need to
have expertise in the areas which the
group talks about. she is pleased that
in the Grinnell group this year there is
one person who runs his own solar
generator and several others who
have had practical experience work-
ing with other alternative energy
sources, such as power from animal
wates.
