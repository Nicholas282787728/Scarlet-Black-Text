Security problem unsolvable

by John illnnriel

Campus thefts are an unsolvable
problem with no easy solution,
says Jim 'l‘ederman, Dean of
Student Affairs

“We try to figure out a solution
but it's one of those impUSSlble
problems," he said. “They've hit
some public places which makes
people think it's a crime wave "

GRINNELL POLICE Chief Bill
Peters said at least seven larcenies
have taken place at the college
since the beginning at the year. He
said thefts are a “hit and miss
thing," ,

Additionally, he said, “Just
about anybody can get in tthe
dorms), These things are hap
pening all the time. ltis a problem.
but no more so than it has been."

Tederman said the nature of the
thefts, such as the two cash boxes
stolen from the Forum disk and
the recent theft of an AMVF‘M radio
tapevturntable lrom behind the
Forum desk, bothers him, The date
of the turntable unit’s disappear-
ance, discovered April 9, is
unknown because it was not used
ior approximately a two week
period.

is the Texaco star Red? 1

Doing business with communist
countries is treasonoos, says the
author of a shareholder resolution
which would limit Texaco lnc.'s
dealings with eastern bluc coun-
tries.

”Corporations who have
dealings in communist countries
are committing outright treason
for their own profits," said Patrick
L. Smiley.

SMILEY'S PROPOSAL would
add the phrase “The corporation
shall avoid business with com-
munist countries” to Texaco‘s
articles of incorporation. Texaco
management and David Crosby,
the college's Corporate Respon»
sibility Oilicer, oppose the
proposal, but Rob Henak, head of
SGA'S committee that monitors
shareholder resolutions. says he
favors abstaining irom voting. The
proxy will be acted on Apr. 24.

Communists are bad business
risks, Smiley says.

“THE COMMUNISTS' political
intrigues show they cannot be

The uncertain status of Mears
Cottage remains unchanged
despite the building's recent ad-
mission to the National Register of
Historic Places, says Vice-Provost
Kenneth Brownin .

There are no irm plans cons
cerning Mears ior next year, said
Browning, and there is a “good
chance" the onetime women's
dormitory will be empty when the
fall semester begins. Goodnow

inclusion on the register
“doesn’t diminish your ability to do
anything you want to with the
building” and doesn't prohibit
demolition unless federal funds are
involved. he said.

Mears and Goodnow Hall were

 

trusted.” he said. “We should
direct our resources toward our
own economy and our free worlr!
allies."

Edward Williams, a spokesman
for Texaco. said his company
neither owns nor operates in-
dependently any operations in
communist countries, “We own a
small business through Cal-Tex, a
joint venture with Standard of
Southern California. and gave Red
China license to use a process to
produce fertilizer," he said. “But
I'm not E‘tWr'll‘C we have any direct
dealings rwith communist coun-
tricst,”

SMILEY SAYS TIIE company
still has interests in communist
countries and the Angola cns

‘terprise is an exception in light oi

the recent political events. “The
company had some investment in
Angola belore the communists took
over and they should try to get out
it they can do it without losing their
shirts. but the proposal is meant to
further prevent and curtail present
investment,” he said

Crosby says he opposes any

erected in 1388, was designed by
Charles D, Marvin, and Goodnow,
built in 1884, was drawn up by
Stephen Earle.

The Search for an architect to
evaluate the feasibility of con
verting Mears into the head-
quarters for the psychology
department and Goodnow into a
home {or the college’s permanent
art collection, first proposed by
President A. Richard Turner, is
still underway, Browning said.
“We have a list oi potential people.
We haven't chosen anyone yet.”

It’s not clear when an architect
will be selected. he said. but he
hopes one could be chosen within
the next month. “I'd hope we could
get things going along that kind oi
time frame". , .

restrictions which would promote
discord between nations, “The
better the trade relations. the bet»
ter the world will learn to get along
together,” he said. “The proposal
would put a lot of political strain
between us and communist
countries."

ALTHOUGH CROSBY HAS not
submitted his proposal to vote
againstSmiley's amendmentto the
Trustee‘s Finance Committee, he
said he assumes the college will
probably vote with the manage
ment.

SMILE ‘ l’lt0P( i\li defines
“communist countries" as the
Soviet Union and its eastern
European satellites, Southeast
Asian regiincs, Cuba, The People‘s
Republic of China, North Korea,
Mongolia. Macao, and Tibet. It
mentions no nations in southern
Africa.

Management's response says,
“the company's flexibility in
conducting business with foreign
nations should not be lettered by
rigid bylaw provisions or policy
directives which would limit its
ability to respond to changes in
world conditions."

THE COMPANY ACTS Within
the limits oi U s, loreign policy, the
Statement says. “If the stock
holders want to affect foreign
policy we think they should go to
the government," says company
spokesman Carl Davis.

Rob Henak disagrees with the
company’s view at itself as a non-
political influence. “The general
statement that a corporation
shouldn’t be politically involved is
contradictory.” he said “I think
the stockholders show their sup-
port by giving or Withholding in
dustry,“ .

Crosby said no letters from
students have yet reached his
office, but Henak said he was in the
process of writing one, urging the
college to abstain because of the
contradictions. “I feel trade
restrictions are wrong, but the
generalized statement the com-
pany makes is inconsistent with
our statements toward South
Africa."

 

 

 

PETERS ATTRIRUTES the
crimes to ii “pattern that's been
going on for years." He said the
police department has no evidence
on any at the recent thclts but
added. “I don't think it's a certain
group ”

'l‘ederman said that over breaks
all halls arc locked and two night
watchmen go through dorms.
However. they spend much of their
time checking mechanical
systems “Realistically." he said,
“the problem is that we have a
large campus, an awlul lot of
buildings, and many places lor
access into buildings."

TEDERMAN is NOT optimistic
about the possibility at using on»
campus storage in residence halls
during these break periods
because he [ears that a thief might
be able to take a greater number oi
valuables more quickly. But if the
problem worsens, “We may have
to think of storing students'
valuable items over break,” he
said.

The addition of extra security
personnel would not practically
accomplish anything, he said. The
Simplest solution Is a 24 hour
lockup which has been instituted in
the past. “But even n M the lockup
doesn't work because students
block up the doors. If students
would cooperate, I‘d like to in-
stitute a 10 pm, lockup, however,
this kind or system is only good as
long as people are cooperative,"
Tederman said.

BUT HE SA"). “1 can't see any

real solution."

He said Sometimes an increase
In theft occurs right at the end of
school due to a decrease in the

ry oak tree. . .’

number of students present.

Also. internal theft peaks thelast
week before breaks, llc said
Tedcrman lccls it may not he a bad
idea to try the it: p m. lockup the
last lew days of finals and see it it
nnrks. ”My only hesitation is that
people hr .ik door windows nlien
they don't have their keys," he
said.

PETERS S “D students must be
security conscious. He mentioned
the locking of dorm doors and a
keen eye towards outsiders as
important deterrents of thefts
Peters said, “if a few people get
together, make sure you know who
is there."

Tederman added, “We've put a
lot of money into the locks and
doors in the renovated halls."

WHILE NONE OF the stolen
stereo equipment irom the dorm
break-Ins has been located yet,
Peters said the police department
frequently checks out pawn shops
in other towns, “If I can find the
equipment. then we can start
worrying who look it.”

He said, ”when you do have
something missing, report it ims
mediately. [tmight be at the police
station lying around,"

ALSO. SAID Tederman, it is a
good idea to write down the serial
number on items such as stereos
and television sets. Standard in
surance policies often cover these
kinds of thefts.

Peters believes warmer weather
will trigger an increase in bicycle
thefts, Meanwhile, it one is
missing, Peteis suggess that the
student come down to the police
department and look for it. The
department hasa full rack of them,
