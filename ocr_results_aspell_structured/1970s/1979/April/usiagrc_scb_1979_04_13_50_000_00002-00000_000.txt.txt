Find Service survey

Thumbs down on K- Loaf

by Marikay Kam eczura

Cheese lasagna? Yes Pizza'.l
Yes. But Special K loaf? Forget it.

Grinnell students expressed
these and other Sentiments in a
survey distributed on a lavorite
subjectifoodibefore spring
break by the food service.

CHEESE LASAGNA was the
winner of the cuisine popularity
contest attaining an average score
of 3.9 out of a possible five. Pizza
also scored well, said food service
director Dave McConnell, Special
K loaf. with a [.5 score. will not be
seen much longer on the menu due
to is widespread unpopularity, he
said.

McConnell says this survey is
conducted every other year to
appraise the menu and get
student feedback about individual
items. The data is then evaluated
for the composition of a new menu,
he said.

TIIIS YEAR ONLY 33 percent of
the students on board responded to
the survey, but McConnell said he
thinks the percentage adequately
reflects campus opinion on the
quality of FOG. "Generally, 1 think
the menu's in pretty good shape,”
he Said

He said he aims for meals which
average a 30 score This goal will
be attained by presenting popular
entrees with those that are less
popular but still nutritious and
tempting to a suiticient number or
diners,

“OBVIOUSLY. WHEN YOU get
something like Special K loaf one
night,” McConnell said. “you're
not going to have a balance on the
menu because students don't have
too much of a choice, So for a
better balance, we'll drop the
unpopular item or interchange it
with a more acceptable entree
from another night‘s menu."

The survey results give food
service an indication of what on
trees should appear more, or less.

should be dropped altogether, he
said. In general, said McConnell.

creased, he said Because of the
positive response to pizza, Mo»
Connell says he intends to increase
its appearance at meals to once a
week as opposed to the two times a
month it is served now.

McConnell Said he believes some
popular items cannot be on the
menu too often because they have
already reached a saturation point.
“Omelets were highly rated, but i
think we have them out often
enough.”

ROAST BEEF AND chicken kiev

have never sampled any of the 33
types of soup offered throughout
the year. “I‘m just amazed at the
number of students who don’t eat
soup,” says McConnell. “Maybe
we should start a campaign to
promote soup and Sandwich."

The salad bar was universally
acceptable, McConnell said. Some
interest was expressed in having
more premium condiments such as
cheese or chopped eggs more often.
“We don‘t see any change there
due to economics."

MOST STUDENTS agreed junk

also did well with a 3.5 rating. Fish
entrees, except for salmon
croquets, were quite popular and,
like many vegetarian dishes, may
be on the menu more often because
of that popularity.

He says liver and onions which
rate a IOWrscoring 2.3, will stay on
the menu at least once a month
Although 48 percent oi the students
surveyed couldn't stand it, «11
percent rated it as good or better.
“We'll keep it. because a decent
number of student like it, it’s
nutritious and it doesn't require
extensive advance preparation."

Connell Said he would like to
reduce the amount of reiined sugar
at meals by introducing water-
packed fruit and by investigating
alternatives to especially sweet
pies and Cakes. He said he also
intends to designatea day on which
students can sample new entrees in
addition to what is regularly or
iered. Changes resulting from the
survey data will take place
gradually with the more radical
changes appearing next semester.

One change that appeared after
break was Sell-made Sack lunches.
McConnell approved the innovation

what they want, It's also a nice
option for those who want lo eat
