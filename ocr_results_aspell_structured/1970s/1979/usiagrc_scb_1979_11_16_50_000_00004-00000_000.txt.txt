Senator Edward Kennedy may be a
leader in the United States Senate, the
brother oi two great political leaders
of the 19605, and a darling oi the
liberals, but at Grinnell College last
Tuesday, he talked like just another
politician.

Speaking to a packed house and the

local and national media, Kennedy at

tacked President Carter by calling the
sounds from the White House ones of
uncertainty and retreat. Carter, he
said, accuses the people oi malaise.
yet there is mismanagement and
malaise present at the highest levels
of the administration.

Kennedy’s speech was clearly
designed to drum up popular support.
To this end, he made repealed frontal
attacks on Carter's leadership. Yet
throughout his statement, Kennedy
tailed to stimulate any intellectual
evaluation of the issues.

“We have a President Who does not
take charge himsell but delegates all
authority to others," Kennedy said.
“The only response we have heard
from this administration is on the
issue of wage price guidelines, I agree
with voluntary price guidelines but 1
strongly disagree with how they are to
be implemented (by the present ad-
ministration).”

“The degree of uncertainty (in
Carter’s administration) reflects itself
in the decrease of productivity and in
novation. i say it's time to end 12
years oi Republican rule and put a
real Democrat in the White House
once again” Kennedy added.

Kennedy also challenged Carter‘s
passing off of the oil situation to his
advisers when he stated “If we are to

succeed in holding down the price of
oil, the President must get involved
himself.”

Kennedy additionally believes that
the decontrol policy of Carter's ad
ministration is unfair and thinks the
country needs an honest windfall proe
fits tax, ”not a fig leaf over
the..,enurmous proiits." Americans
must “reduce our dependence on
toreign oil" and look to viable synr
thetics: “We must never permit our
nation to become a Victim."

Kennedy’s policy discussion lacked
merit. The senator must have forgot
ten he was speaking to an audience at
an institute of higher learning.
Delving into Several aspects of his
statement, contradictions emerge as
the product oi his eiiort to promise too
much.

For instance, the senator remarked
he favors “conservation through in-
centives to homeowners and in
dustries." As of now, similar incentive
ellorts have been relatively ineffective
in reducing the consumption of fossil

iuels. Deregulation, perhaps the must
efective means through which to
reduce consumption, was discarded by
by Kennedy.

The senator failed to otter a pro-
gram to prevent the United States
from becoming, as he said, “beggars
at the OPEC banquet table,"
Kennedy also discussed the ad
ministration’s inability to curb inflar
tion, stating that when Carter took 0i-

»iice in 1977 inflation was less than 5%,

but it has since tripled, Kennedy at-
tacked high interest rates, yet basic
monetary policy has included high in-
terest rates in an inflation reducing
strategy. Kennedy has said he op
poses high interest rates since they
may stillc economic growth. He feels
Carter’s present policy is “a tinkering
with problems of inflation and the
economy. The single action the ad
ministration has taken With will con-
tribute most to inflation is the
deregulation of oil prices.”

The problem with his analysis is
that he fails to see that a lower inilar
tion rate means a trade off resulting
in higher inter‘e t rates. '

Kennedy also hinks the United
States can't resolve malty problems
around the world but can at least be
a moving force, In reference to a
question about the boat people, he
responded, “I think all Americans are
enormously concerned over the

Bomb threat proves hoax

Grinnell police received an
anonymous bomb threat while Ted
Kennedy was speaking at the college
Tuesday.

The call came at my p.m,, less
than 15 minutes after Kennedy arrived
on campus to speak; the caller claim»
ed the bomb would go oil in 17
minutes.

According to Dennis l-laltcrman oi
the Omaha Secret Service Office, the
threat was still under investigation
Wednesday,

Secret Service officers had arrived
in Grinnell beiore the Kennedy speech
and a routine sweep or Darby had

earlier sweep, done betore the crowd
entered the gym, no order to evacuate
the gym was given.

“How we react hinges on what we
know about the place that we're in
prior to the visit,” Halterman Said.

The routine sweep beiore Kennedy's
arrival included all nooks and crane
nies oi Darby, and the building was
closed to unauthorized personnel until
the Crowd was allowed ill at about
11:20. Thus, it was unlikely that a
bomb could have been planted in the
building, the Grinnell Herald-Register
