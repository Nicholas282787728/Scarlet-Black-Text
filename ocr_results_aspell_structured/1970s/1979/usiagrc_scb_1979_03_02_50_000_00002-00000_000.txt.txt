or tenured positions, six faculty
women have tenure, an increase of
two since last year. Despite this
increase, Grinnell falls short of the
national average of 16.5 per cent as
reported in a study by the
American Association of
University Women, Browning said,
“There hasn't been as much
progress as people might have
thought ” The report states that it
is unlikely the college will reach
the national average because
of promotion policies.
MINORITY FACULTY have
Increased from three last year, to
five this year, and one minority
faculty members holds tenure this
year, Browning said that the
primarily white population of
Gl'lnnell has “made It difficult in
the past to attract minorities."
The professional staff, com-
prised oi such varied positions as
president, senior administrators,
and writing lab stoii members,

contains 59 appointments. Twenty-'

six positions are held by women.

YOU’I'Z SAID the most im-
portant component of a successful
presidential campaign is that the
candidate avoid underestimating
the perceptiveness ol the student
body.

“First, I would advise the
candidate to take a specific Stand
on issues that are salient to the
campus community," he said.
“Second, he or she should have

faculty are men; eight of ten
persons holding or sharing full-

time positions are men; and eight

of ten persons holding part~time
positions are women.

The support staff contains the
workers in the physical plant, food
service, and managerial clerical
positions or the 139 employees, 70
are men, 119 women, and two
minorities, with men heavily
populating the managerial posts.

THE DAT/i SHOWS no salary
discrimination among any of the
employees, Browning cited a

positive example of the uselulnoss
of the annual report when last year
four women “appeared to be un-
derpaid.” The college evaluated
the situation and rectified the
salaries,

Because the college has no
contracts with the federal
government; it is not obligated to
follow the Affirmative Action
Mandate, but Browning feels the
faculty variation achieved under
Affirmative Action will provide
role models and give studenm a
broader education.
