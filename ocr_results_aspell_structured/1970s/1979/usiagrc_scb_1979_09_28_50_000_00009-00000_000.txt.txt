ossibility is to start the school year in mid-August to

he advantage of the warmer weather

Browning thinks this idea has two major problems,

ne is that starting school early would take away
nmc ot the time that Buildings and Grounds uses to
mplete its summer renovation and refurbishing

roiects. .

“They get a lot or work done during the summer
ionths," Browning said.

Another problem is that beginning the school year
arlier does not really address issues oi saving
nergy. The real bite on the college’s supplies comes

March. At this crucial time, supplies tend to be
w and only good weather prevents them from being

eoleted.
For this winter, Browning believes the fuel supplies

ill be enough to get us through until March. He
aid the college will cut energy use to a minimum
etween semesters.

“We’re really going to buckle down during winter
treak," Browning said. He added that savings made
ver break will provide enough fuel to adequately
eat campus buildings while staying within the presi~
ent’s guidelines. “We think, with a little bit of conv
ervation, we can get through. We will not have pet)»
ole who are freezing this winter," he said

What are the long range energy
perspectives for Grinnell College?
Philosophers and physicists would on
viously dirier regarding the “Correct"
answer to this question. Accordingly,
while philosophy Professor Jack
Worley and physics Professor Charles
Duke are concerned about the energy
situation at Grinnell, each has a
decidedly different outlook as to which
direction the college should take to
meet its iuture energy needs.

Duke feels that Iowa coal may soon
become a major source of fuel [or the
college as oil prices rise and supplies
shrink, Warlcy agrees that coal would

be a ieasible form or energy, but only
it the Iowa strip mines were reopened.
This would provide a convenient
source, but steps would have to be
taken to make sure the coal was burn-
ed as cleanly as possible.

Will solar energy ever otter aviable
alternative when fossil fuels are ex-
hausted? Duke believes that the
“solar alternative just isn’t here yet,”
but he thinks the college will eventualr
ly get around to using solar energy,
He points out that it is very difficult to
adapt solar panels to existing
buildings. “The only buildings on
campus which might be suitable for

Plans for the middle distance

The medium-run, the middle
distance oi energy planning, is often
ignored. What action can be taken in
the next tew years, while there are
still suppllies of oil?

Vice provost Ken Browning pointed
out that with oil supplies depleting,
“you have to look around at something
else,” He said the college is looking
carefully into the possibility of converr
ting the physical plant from an oilr
burning to a coal burning system.
Recently, Director of the Physical

.lember 28, 1979

Plant Dale Hawn attended a con-
ference on coal-generated heating.

“We're getting as idea of costs and
we have to examine it for the future,"
Browning said.

As far as alternative energy sources
are concerned, Browning believes it is
an open question. He said that the col»
lege would not rule out alternative
sources. Unfortunately, Browning
says such sources as solar power are
“a little ways away from being
adopted by an institution."

solar energy collection would be the r
PEC, Herrick Chapel, and the Fine I
Arts Building,” Duke continues, _ ’ I
“because those are the only structures
with large 'walls with a southern ex-
posure." He asserts, “It is much I
easier to build new buildings daigne
for solar heating." If the entire roof
of Herrick Chapel were covered with
solar panels, it would only produce
enough energy to heat about 70% 9 '
the building. ‘ g
Duke also stresses the difficulty of ’
transporting and storing solar energy
after it is collected. “It is much more‘
efficient to have the panels on the- ‘ '
buildings that are going to utilize the
solar energy." It would be nearly im~
possible to install solar panels on the ,
dorms, and therefore very difficult to «
make use of solar energy as their heat»
source. '
Duke concludes, “In the long run, . ,
Grinnell Will get energy from a large, ._
variety of technologies, including solar
energy, wind power, cargeneration,
etc. But we, as a college, are not in, . _
any position to develop the necessary ,
technology at this time. We'll just '
have to wait for the technology to
evolve." ‘ .
Worley is in favor of a schedule shift i
rather than implementation of advance ‘
ed technology. “If they put solar
