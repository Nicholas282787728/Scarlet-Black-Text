Martyred Again

Hold up your watercolors.

For me to see.

You put them together so well,

So righteously unartificial.

They practically hang in the air

Waltlng to be noticed,

Like my thoughts across the roorn,

Hovering about the edges

Of your drawing pad.

You tried using charcoal,

But there was no depth for you.

And painting canvas

Could not withstand your holiness,

There was nothing left to do,

But return to watercolors

And dive into yourself again.

» Morning

Requiem

There was
A
Black and white sunrise
This morning.
At dawn
The robins chirped
Silently
In two-part harmony.
The breeze
Rustled the trees on the

leaves
And blew the sun away.
The cloud
Fell down in cotton balls
And
Covered the ground
With a summer snow.
And someone said,
"There is something wrong

with the world today."
And
No one
Listened.

Fslleh Wonder washes hsir

Jesus Christ becomes s bear ‘

Trimming 0“ the Make-stir.
Cheese,

Hettyert splits its rash in threes;

[Spilling nickels here and there.)

“John Ihe Baptist. Iell me, please,
Where the honey mites bees."
“Honey, from my poinl of view,
noesn’t raise: it builds with glue.”
(Jolmhy tickles asker’s knees.)

So the Baptist rolls a few

And ﬂoats on Ihem to the zoos

God and Mary have a lrysl;

Bear lllrns into Jesus ChrisL

(cttchhld Joseph cries boo-hoo.)
