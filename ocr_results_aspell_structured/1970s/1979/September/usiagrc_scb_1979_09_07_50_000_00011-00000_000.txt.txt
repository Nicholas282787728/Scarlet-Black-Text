:Blcyclé "studneSS" made easy

First, no offense, “stud” is a generic term.

New, start riding. As those in knowledgeable circles say (smugly), “It’s not
the hike, it‘s the rider.” Make sure the hike is properly adjusted to fit you, that
the‘seat position is comfortable and feet are properly placed on the pedals. Toe
clips and straps help here, and also with pedaling (up to a 40% increase in effi-
ciency), They are the one truly indispensable accessory for serious cycling, so

get themii‘ you don't have them.
:Next, learn to use your clips; perfect

the "ankling" technique of pulling up as

wellias pushing down on the pedals, so as to get them moving in a smooth arc

and at a steady cadencei

_ Don’t tryto push gears that are too high: if in doubt, always shift down and
spin fasten Try not to wobble or swerve while on the road, keep to a straight
line and put all of your energy into the pedals.

It’s also more efficient to ride with your hands on the lowest part of the
handlebars, with elbows bent to absorb shocks. This position reduces wind
resistance and makes you look like a racer. Of course, to really look like a
racer, you must have a prestigious bike and appropriate cycling clothes, so if
you can‘t afford to look like a “stud” you should try to ride like one. .

close. You also get to see the town of
Searsboro, which is sort of a quaint
and unusual place, reminding many
racers of their homes on Sicily or the
Pyrenees.

After the only real hill and curve on
the road, you can see the town and its
tiny “consolidated" school nestled
along the railroad tracks and tucked
between 146 and a hill. Less visibly
prosperous than other small lowa
towns, Searsboro boasts more potholes
per capita outside oi New York or
Elgood, West Virginia, a couple of
large grain elevators, and the once-
r'eknowned Little Bear Inn, which used
to be a favorite haunt of some Grinnell
College students until it developed a
rowdy and unsavory reputation.

Yet, perhaps the best part of the
Searsboro Classique is not along route
146 at all, but down an unobstrusive
and mystically inviting turnoff about
six miles south of Grinneilt This road
leads west and south to a town called
Ewart, into a countryside vastly dil-
i'erent from the huge open fields along
146,

The land is rolling and lush, dotted
with streams and woods, like a
sprawling pastoral scene. Around the
tiny town of Ewart itself. the land has
actually encroached upon the built-up
spread of civilization that is so ram-
pant elsewhere, a heartening develop-
ment for those of us who don't like
what's happening in West Des Moines,

Corn and soybeans now grow where
houses and streeLs were, so that very
few buildings are left. The effect is
fascinating.

Giro di Malcom

Past Ewart, the road continues on to
an intersection leading lib-Highways
”6 (to Searsboro) and 63 (to
Montezuma). Highway so travels
north from Montezuma to cross the
last great bicycle route, the Giro di
Malcom.

Saplember 7, W79

in contrast to the other side of town,
Route 6 east of Grinnell is relatively
flat and devoid oi memorable sights;
moreover, the slabs of concrete pave-
ment were not set evenly, so that your
tires go kathump, kathump, kathump
continually. The great racers,
however, have eagerly put up with
these inconveniences to participate in
this traditional 25vmiler, the Giro di
Malcom. '

Though the route begins on Highway
6, it does not stay there: after about
five miles, past the giant white Cargill
Seed Plant and two rolling hills, a
macadam road jogs off to the south,
across from the intersection with the
closed portion of Highway 63.

This is Old Route 6, and it turns
parallel to the highway after a decepv
tively steep hill and gravel road in-
tersection. Old Highway 6 is a very

ll

pleasant and lightlyrtraveled road,
generally flat, passing old barns. _a _ _.
radio antenna, and new farmhouses.

In front of one oi these houses is the
Ponderosa spread of Burdette _
Farley‘s Angus ranch. It was near. ,
here that Guillermo diStrange wa
tacked by a huge st. Bernard, whom,
he beat sadistically about the face and
neck with his Zolal pump. . . .

Too soon. Old Route 6 intersects , ,
Route 53, on which you turn south: ,‘
travel the two or three miles of mo ,e
rough-surfaced concrete road to arrive
at the town of Malcom. Perhaps best .
known [or its bar. the Poor House, and
its all-night restaurant and truck stop;
Benny's Nature Cabin, Malcom is- .
really not that much of a swinging, . ,
town. It seems an aged, tired com»
munity, with the usual churches, _. ,
school, watertower, and city park, but
very little new construction or , . .
maintenance of its once-fine old
houses.

If you go back to Old Route 6 an .
continue east for live more miles, into._
increasingly wooded and hilly country,
you will eventually approach a long
sequence of genuine rollercoaster .
hills, heralding the town of Brooklyn;-

About half as big as’ Grinnell,
Brooklyn contains a charming
business district, a notable church at
the top of a hill, and the intriguingly
Victorian Hotel Brooklyn.

Even more interesting, it is said, is
the legendary country along Old Route.
6 toward Victor and Ladora, toward
the Amana Colonies. i would
elaborate, but few oi the great cyclists
have seen this area, for it was along
Old Route 6 that the incomparable
Jacques LePell ascended into that
Great Bike Shop in the Sky. The rest
of us have been afraid to follow him.
