‘My summer? —Don’t ask!’

My preparation for returning to the
“Big G" after another long, lousy
summer includes more than just
raiding my house of all removeable
sundries, art prints, and albums. 1
must also prepare myself for the big
question, "How was your summer?"
which, of course, is asked by every
living being on this campus who finds
your face even vaguely familiar.

This semester I thought I’d Come up
with the perfect enviable answer. I
spent the summer in Martinique work-
ing on an internship with
“Gentlemen's Quarterly. I only got
$5.00 an hour but,..I decided to take
the job anyway as it would look great
on a resume, etc..,” 1 must say the
answer worked effectively in drawing
green responses or “Gosh" and
“Golly" till someone made the obser-
vation that for having worked in Mar
tinique my skin was still white as an
Iowa winter.

Okay, so 1 was lying Let the truth
be known. Now that the Pope and
Jane Fonda are coming to Des Moines
and the town truly is “The Surprising
Place," I‘m not ashamed to admit I
spent the summer there. i worked in a
hardware store, no less, right across
from the fairgrounds. Benefits of the
job included free tickets to the
fairgrounds the night before the fair
started, to watch the concessioners set
up in a last minute panic.

Well, it you saw your way through
my enviable summer, 1 also saw my
through yours.

One guy told me he spent the idyllic
Summer in Grinnell..,“1t’s so laid
back around here in the summer, Peo-
ple really know what they're talking
about when they mention the lazy,
crazy days of an Iowa summer.”

Yeah, right. I’ll tell you the real
story. The guy criticized B S: G all
year for never doing anything, then
worked for them all summer, not do-
ing a thing.

I have another friend who gloried in
having snagged a prestigious intern»
ship working for an Iowa paper.
That's a joke in iLselt. Then, it came
out in an a ' ht bull session that his
only responsi ty was copying the
local livestock report.

Some unfortunate people are forced
to spend their summers working at
jobs so repugnant to their loltv moral
principles that it is really amazing

they don’t return to school with ulcers
and psychological hang-ups.

For example, consider the problems
of being a MOBE member who, in
order to return to school, is forced to
work the summer in his father‘s com-
pany. Tragically, the company owns
large shares of stock in South Africa
and two southern nuclear power
plants.

There is the real life example of the
girl who petitioned McConnell to do
away with junk food at food service, If
pressed, she’ll tearfully admit she
spent her “vacation” peddling
Twinkies and Ding-Dongs at a day old
thrift store.

After hearing several of these sad
stories, I realized how silly it was for
me to pretend I did anything exciting,
interesting, or meaningful during the
summer break. Face it, i spent the
Summer in the real world I’m finally
coming to grips with the fact thatI
will probably always work in a hard-

High Holy Days slighted?

Dear Editor: For those who do not
already know, Parents‘Weekend has
been changed to the weekend of
September 21-23. Also, for those of you
who may not know, September 21 and
22 are the dates of Rosh Hashana, the
Jewish New Year Celebration. It is a
time for families to join togemer in
celebrating a joyous year , one of the
most important days in the Hebrew
calendar.

Approximately onerthird to onerhalf
of the students at Grinnell this
semester are Jewish (some more or
thodox than others). By placing
Parents’ Weekend at this particular
time, the college is literally forcing
these students and their families to
make a decision whether to observe
the rites and rituals of their faith, or
to attend the events of Parents‘
Weekend.

In talking with some members of
the college administration, I was in

Anyway, i for one am taking a vow
never again to ask the dreaded ques»
tion, “How was your summer?" I
don’t want people to feel so ashamed
that they lie about what they did.
Neither do I want to hear about their
meaningful, soul—searching summer

New Zealand. Especially while I

formed that the change was being
made because there was “absolutely
nothing going on culturally on campus
the weekend of October 576 (the
previous dates of Parents’ Weekend),
whereas September 21722 are very rich
in Cultural activities." I was told that
“there won’t even be a football game
here during the October weekend."

My question is: why can‘t the colr
lege switch some of these “cultural
events?" I feel that this predicament
could have been avoided completely
had more consideration and organiza-
tion been used in planning the college
calendar.

Many students and faculty, both
those who are Jewish and those who
are not, are greatly offended by this
move. I’m positive that I’m not the on-
ly Jewish student who was looking for»
ward to seeing my family, and will
now not be able to because of the High
