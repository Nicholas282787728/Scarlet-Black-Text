has played with everyone in jazz,
from Charlie Parker to Ornctte
Coleman.

in his 30 years as a proiessionai
musician, Paul Bley has left his
streak in the tradition of jazz, yet
at the moment he plays a note. he
struggles to escape the jazz
tradition, to improvise genuinely

improvisation, a vital element of
jazz, is one oiBley's main pursuits,
Improvising, says Bley. is the
opposite of practice. “You can't
practice improvising because
practice is the repetition oi
something to be able to execute it.
The same training Will destroy the
process at improvising."

It is not too surprising, then, that
Bley does not own a piano. ”You
have to play in the place where you
intend to play, with the players you
intend to play with. Obviously.
playing In your irontroom will only
make you a good lront room
player!”

Not owning his own piano has
skilled Bley m the art oi playing on

vantage of playing a lot of in
struments is that in about sixty
seconds you can get a good over
view oi a particular piano. You
immediately find out that this is
not a full instrument, but a partial
instrument. Of thesis keys. perhaps
only 15 are useful,"

Paul Bley’s talent at quickly
learning to play instruments has no
doubt helped him to innovate. In
1963, Bley became the first jazz
musician ever to play a synthesizer
in a live performance. in the mid-
70's, as part oi a trio including
Dave Holland and Barry Altschul,
he stacked an electric piano and a
harp synthesizer on top oi a

Steinway grand piano, allowing
him to move fluidly from one
keyboard to another. Bley in-
