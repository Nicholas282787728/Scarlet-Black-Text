Readers from extremes differ on gays

To the editior: We salute the 5&3
lohattempting to explore the issue oi
homosexuality, lor it does exist on this
camws and is a relevant question for
both straights and gays.

However, the task set forth in last
week’s a‘rticle’ito “find out what
Grinnell is like for gays”— is an im-
possibility. _It would be possible to
focus on a single gay student and ex-
plore her life as a homosex-
ual However, when you try to ascer-
tain characteristics of a diverse group
of individuals with only one personali-
ty trait in common, you are reduced to
dealing in generalizations.

We feel it is necessary to discuss
several points within the article itself
which we feel need some clarification.

First of all, the GCGC is not
divided according to sex; it is open to
people of both sexes However. there
also exists a "womyn’s” support
group formed in order to adequately
fulfill the needs of lesbians. Both
groups work together by sharing infor-
mation and support on political issues.
Also, financial support for both
groups is drawn from a single SGA
fund.

Second, our objections to identifica-
tion oi gays in the article were
misunderstood. They were not due to
any reservations oi publicly admitting
our homosexuality because of feelings
of guilt or shame. Rather, we [eared
the misrepresentation that could arise
from a few individuals speaking [or
the entire comminity.

Thirdly, many quotations were inacr
curate or misconstrued, resulting in
incorrect and unjustified conclusions.
Also. due to the length of the article
and the effort to present an overview
of the issue, many questions raised
were dealt with insufficiently,
ultimately leaving the reader with a
very shallow level of understanding.

Lastly, during Mandel’s interview,
no moral questions were raised, nor
was a justification of our positions or
orientation sought. it was therelore
very upsetting to he confronted with

anti homosexual opinions based on a
moral interpretation of the issue in the
form of the Inter-Varsity Christian
Fellowship’s stand.

We will not attempt to refute the
Fellowship’s position on homosexuali-
ty here, nor deny them the right to
their opinion; however, when attempr
ting to produce a tolerant and accep-
ting atmosphere toward homosexuali~
ty, it is counter-productive to leave the
reader with anti-homosexual sen-
timents.

In conclusion, we find it rather
disconcerting to be confronted with
the notion that we must be
“psychiatrically” understood

Homosexuality is not a disease;
lifestyle. There is nothing to under»
stand except the fact that homosezh,
uality is merely a sexual preference
that does not control or dictate our“
lives. ”What. homosexuality really
is an emotional attitude or orien-

tation that can possibly manifest itself
in sexual expression.

it is just one oi the many aspects of
our personalities what must be _
understood are our feelings and at-,
titudes, and understanding leading to
acceptance of homosexuality as a way
of lite. Sincerely,Ruth Gresser.‘

Offers Biblical interpretation

To the editor: In response to the
author oi this quote:

“ ‘The Bible,’ according to their
spokesman, ‘forbids the practice of
homosexuality. There is nothing in the
Bible which condemns men and
women having homosexual desires.
The condemnation is in actual in-
dulgence.

“ ‘God realizes that homosexuals
are not necessarily responsible for
their sexual preferences, just as
heterosexuals aren’t, But the act of
homosexuality is a sin explicitly pro-
hibited in both the Old and New
Testaments.‘ "

My dear brother or sister in Christ
Jesus: In the love of Christ Jesus I
would like to entreat you to re-
examine scripture in both the Old and
New Testaments, The following scrip»
ture verses from Thompson’s Chain
Reference Bible (King James version)
should suggest certain revisions in the
statement above.

“For the life of the flesh is in the
blood: and i have given to you upon
the altar to make an atonement for
your souls: for it is the blood that
maketh atonement for the soul."
(Leviticus 17:11)

“Thou shalt not lie with mankind as

Instructors skip class

To the editor: One assumption
students have is that teachers will
show upror classes, In the case of

P.E. classes, however, this assump-
tion does not appear to hold true.
Not only has our teacher not shown

with womankind; it is abomination.”
(Lev. 13: 22)

God 5 concern is with our soul, first,
and then the desires of our soul which
find physical expression.

“Ye have heard that it was said by
them of old time, thou shalt not come
mit adultery: but I say unto you that
whoseoever lookem on a woman to
lust after her hath committed adultery
with her already' in his heart. ”
(Matthew 5. 27 ,23) *

God isthe definition of Holiness ahd
Righteousness. He cannot tolerate im»
perfection, for there is no contradicA
tion Within himself. God cannot
tolerate mankind except through the
atonement of the blood. All of
mankind needs to be washed in the .
blood of sacrifice. At one time, a pure
lamb was sufficient, But that wasa.
foreshadowing of the sacrifice of - '
God’s lambidesus of Nazareth.

Homosexuality along with all other
sin separates man from God. Man
must be washed by the blood of Jesus.
This can occur only as an individual

Jesus, and believes that Jesus Is his
