What’s wrong with society?

All interview with author and
educator Jonathan Kozol
highlights this week’s KDIC
special programming. Recorded in
1975, the interview includes
readings from anol’s book 'l‘ltc
Night is Dark and I Am Far From
Home.

Kozol believes that our system of
education has been very successful
at what it does, which is to provide
the children of middle and upper
classes with rationalizations for

- their priviledged places in society
The schools assure them that their
easy existence is not at the expense
of those less fortunate and fosters
apathy by discouraging action
against injustice with the rationale
ization that “lhat’s the way things
are and always have been '-

Space. Braxton’s
final frontier

' ‘mtONY BMW)“

 

by Steve Brull

Although Anthony Braxton is
known as an avant-garde jazz
musician; the music on this album
is best classified as modern
classical or Twentieth Century
music. In this realm Eraxton is in-
iluenced by the works of
Stockhausen and Cage, in the
tradition of the White avant—garde

This Work follows Cage in its use
of multiple orchestralism. It is
scored for 160 musicians, divided
int four orchestras of 40.
positioned in a circie with the
conductor in the middle. The
audience sits in and around the
orchestra. Being over two hours
long, this work is captured on six
quadrophonic sides, and leatures
the Oberlin College Orchestra.

ONE IN A series often pieces he
has planned that explore the
possibilities of multiple or
chestralism, Braxton is concerned
with the location of an individual
sound source and the patterns of
sound movement created by the
Whole orchestra. To this end he has
employed lour orchestras, but'
further control of the ”spatial
dynamics" is gained by having the
musicians sit on swivel chairs.
where they can alter their ins
struments’ positions,

With the invention of a new
notation system. Braxton can
speciiy the precise trajectory oi

explains that the significance oi
this is in making the performing
space an integral part of the
performance. The sonic dynamics
oi this composition now resemble
more fully those loundin nature. in
Braxton‘s words “to experience
the realness of this composition is
to experience a living and
breathing universe "

This composition is calm,
flowing, and symmetrical, N0
regualr rhythmic pulse is found;
instead, the music ebbs and flows
by quietly. We hear none of the
wild frenzy that he exhibited here
last February. Tone colors are
dark, though translucent. The
climax comes in the middle as the
trumpets lead the brass section in
a barrage of bright, bursting
chords, piercing the dark, somber
section that precedes

THE ALBUM SHOWS us
Braxton the intense intellectual,
and as such the music feels Con-
strained. As he works to specify
and control every orchestral ut-
terance. the work loses spontaneity
and gut inspiration. Indeed, the
value of this piece ltes in its in
novative use of spackwhich if not
heard in quadrophonic is less than
spectacular.

But don't despair, Braxton plans
ahead. This composition is but one
in a series of ten that explores
space. For example, by 1932 he
plans to complete a work for ten
orchestrasiat different spatial
locations but connected by
television. By 1985 he hopes to
finish a work for 100 orchestras—in
four different cities but connected
by satellite

TIIEN IlE WILL become more
adventurous. By 1988, he plans a
composition for a planets; live
planets by 1990; between star
systems by 1995; and set for com-
pletion by the year 2000, a work ior
orchestras located between
galaxies.

Whether or not these works are
realized, their conception leaves no
doubt as to the location of Brax-
ton's imagination.

Star-studded film fare planned

by Robin Radespiel

Once again this \ieek's film
Calendar is starrstudded, with
performances by Barrymore,
Bergman. Lombard, and Rains,
and directing by Hawkes, int
chcock, and Polanski All three
films mix humor with drama to
produce tine, thought-provoking
entertainment

Twentieth Century (1934, 91
mins,), directed by Howard Hawks
(The Big Sleep. To Have and Have
N00. with a screenplay by Ben
bloom and Charles Macarthur, is
one of the original “screwball"
comedies. The film stars John
Barrymore as Broadway producer
Oscar Jaffe and Carole Lombard
as Lilli Garland liormerly Mildred
Plotkal, the lingerie model from
Hoboken. NJ. \Vho Jaffe turns into
a star.

THE TITLE REFEKS to the 20th
Century Limited Train aboard
which much of the film takes place.
Garland and Jane accidentally
meet on the train after a long
separation, during which Lilli has
become a Hollywood star and Jaife
a penniless producer of Broadway
flops. Jalfe's only means of
avoiding bankruptcy is to convince
Lilli to star in his next play, a task
he undertakes aboard the 20th
Century

Although the film is considered a
comedy, it has serious, dramatic
overtones. Despite the abundance
ot theatrics, Twentieth Century
manages to deal with the often
tragic consequences of success and
stardom,

THE CONTINUAL sense of
motion and “rapidrfire” dialogue
provide the film with vitality and a
fast pace. further enhanced by the
Clever performances of Barrymore
and Lombard Incidentally. this
was the film that lifted Lombard
to stardom.

The Alfred Hitchcock Film
Series' contributton to this week's
film fare is Notorious (1946, NZ
mins.), a spy thriller starring
ingrid Bergman, Cary Grant, and
Claude Rains. Ben Hecht and
Charles Macarthur are also
responsible for this screenplay,
distinguishing themselves as
versatile and creative screen-
writers,

THE SCENARIO IS not unr
common: an American agent
(Bergman) on assignment in South
America marries the head of a
group oi German spies (Rains) in
order to watch him, although she
loves another American agent
lGrantl. However, Hitchcock and
his writers take this ordinary plot
and create an incisive exploration
oi personality and human
relationships.

instances of Hitchcock's added
depth abound. For example.
Bergman is not a patriotic martyr
but in fact a “notorious" woman,
famed for her drinking and
romanttc liaisons, who is working.
for the government to atone for her
father's treasonous crimes, Even
more complex is Grant's
character, who is far from the
suave dehonair spy one would
expect him to be Rather. he is a
man who is afraid of women,
trapped by his emotional restraints
and insecurities

ONCE AGAIN Hitchcock
demonstrates his brilliant direch
torial abilities, His use of close-
ups, long shots, and changing
camera perspective add to the
suspense and emotional intensity
oi the film. To truly appreciate
Hitchcock one must be aware of
these techniques and certain
significant motifs which reappear
throughout his films In Nolorious,
be sure to watch for double
characterizations. the many in'
stances oi drinking, and various
Freudian themes.

Rounding out this week’s film
calendar is The Tenant (1976, 126
mins ), a chilling exploration of the
human mind, directed and written
by Roman Polanski (Chinatown,
Rosemary‘s Baby) whostais in the
leading role. in the supporting

 

roles are: lsabelle Adjani, Mclvyn
Douglass, and Shelley Winters.

TIIE PLOT SURROUNDS the
life of a file clerk (Polanskt) in his
newly rented apartment, formerly
inhabited by a young woman who
jumped irom the Window to her
death. The man’s empty life in his
barren apartment is accompanied
by a growing paranoia and belief
that his neighbors are trying to
drive him to suicide, as they did the
previous tenant. The audience is
posed with a frightening, unan-
swereable quesioneis there really
a conspiracy against the tenant or
do these evils exist in his mind?

Polanski skillfully combines
horror with humor in his
examination of the human mind.
He boldly explores themes rarely
dealt with in film, such as tranr
svestisism, schizophrenia, and
suicide, In doing so, he succeeds in
making a strong statement on
modern urban life and the
loneliness and paranoia it creates.

A final note: the Russian and
Eastern European Film Series is
sponsoring the showing of The
Grasshopper 11955, 90 mins.), a
Russian film directed by Samson
Samsonov. Based on a story by
Anton Chekov, the film stars
Sergei Bondarchuk and Ludmllla
Tselikovskaya,
