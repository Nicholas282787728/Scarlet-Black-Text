Each college in the United States
has the opportunity to nominate two
candidates for the scholarship, which
consists of $5000 a year {or their junior
and senior years of undergraduate
study and two years of graduate
school. Grinnell has two candidates
this year: Jim Goodlellow and Sharon
McKee.

Goodfellow, from Wisconsin, plans
an independent major in Soviet-
Americans relations while McKee,
from Iowa, has declared no major as
yet but is leaning towards an-
thropology.

A recommendation lrom a faculty
member and an essay were the first
requirements for the scholarship.
Seven students were nominated, wim
Goodfellow and McKee being chosen
to represent Grinnell. They now go to
the regional level in their home state,
which requires a test and an addir
tional 600 word essay on some aspect
oi public policy. Four students are
then chosen to compete for the final
state award. , _

This year’s candidates were chosen
by a committee headed by Assistant
Professor Wait stone. He says he is
pleased with the candidates this year

and although Stone believes it is a
long snot, both Goodielluw and McKee

have an excellent chance at the
scholarship. He also encourages
ireshmen to participate in next year’s

competition.
Senior political science major Dave
Blatt, a present Truman Scholar, feels
the award is “an excellent opportuniv
ty, although only time will tell as to
what Klnd OI prestige is associated
with it, This will come when the
scholars go on to accomplish, since it
has only been awarded since l977.“
