The organization of Concerned
Black Students (CBS) is not the ace
tively militant group it once was.

CBS has fulfilled its two original
goals, the establishment of the Black
Cultural Center and a black library in
Burling. Simultaneously, the group
has expanded its basic function while
nearly all black students at Grinnell
have participated.

Founded in 1953, CBS provides a
feeling of common ground for the
black student. The organization has
never attempted to isolate blacks from
whites, but instead tries to create a
“feeling of home.”

When CBS was organized, only ten
blacks attended Grinnell and many
had academic problems because they
were reluctant to go to whites for help.
Thus, the organization's function then
was similar to today’s: an organiza-
tion of black students to help black
students at Grinnell.

Today, 38 of the 41 black students
are active in the group. CBS is struc-
tured much like other organizations its
spokesman, Charles McKinnon, is
much like a president or chairman,
and acts in an official speaking
capacity. Other students {ill posts such
as treasurer and historian, which per-
form the less publicized yet vital func-
tions of the organization.

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs
and minority advisor Barry Hurt func-
tions as an administrative liaison.
Funding for CBS comes from SGA and
the administration.

The group’s success stems from the
fact that its members possess similar
background characteristics and in-

terests, For instance, due to their com-
mon heritage, many members discuss-

advocate of black issues '

ed the televismn special Roots in a
way that was not possible with other
members of the campus community.

CBS sponsors two major
weekends~Black Cultural Weekend in
die fall and Black Martyrs Weekend in’
the spring. The two are similar, but
Black Martyrs Weekend provides
more emphasis in terms of programs
and is a “bigger production,” accorr
cling to McKinnon.

One major group goal includes the
renovation of the Black Cultural
Center. It is an off-campus house
located at 1003 Tenth Ave, which can
tains a black library separate from
the one in Burling, black artifacts,
audio-visual equipment, and a general
history or CBS. Two persons elected
by CBS members at the end or the
school year for the next year live
there and are responsible for its
upkeep. The center is also used to
house prominent visitors,

A second objective is to increase
black enrollment. McKinnon pointed
out that general enrollment has
recently increased, yet the number of
black students has been decreasing.
He does not pin the blame on the ad-
ministration but remarked, “They are
responsive and hardworking," The
end resule, however, have shown lew
positive advances. McKinnon reels
that the next rew years will be impor~
tant,

One major undertaking is a Black
Prospective WeekendAlthough he
does not View a significant increase in
black Students as a likely short term
result, he believes that if the college
continues its commitment, more black
alums will be produced and that can
only help the situation.

Weekend focuses on the black struggle

Thursday, November 1, 1979, marks
the beginning of the Black Cultural
Weekend. This is an annual celebra-
tion sponsored by the members of the
Concerned Black Students organizar
tion. This program has been v' bly ac-
tive since 190071, in order to. f
provide to the black students of Grins
nell a cultural and political arena of
black expression in the way of events.
This, in turn, aids in the effort to
maintain their unique cultural identi-
ty, The second objective of the
weekend Is to enhance the extension of
the Afro-American experience into the
white community,

The theme for this year’s Black
Cultural Weekend is: “The Elements
of the Black Aesthetics,” Specific

‘ elements such as poetry, art, music,
and dance, have assisted blacks in
their adjustment within an American
society ruled by a white majority.
Moreover, these elements have served
in upholding African survival, hopes
for freedom, and a means of com-
munlcation.

The understanding and knowledge of
the black struggle is not only impor-
tant in the lives of the black students
of Grinnell‘s campus, but in the lives
of the community as well. By organiz-

Also tied to the problem of attracr
ting black students is the scarcity of
black professors and the problem of
retaining them McKinnnn sees the
biggest obstacle as one of incentives;
other colleges provide more fringe
benefits and higher salaries for black
professors. Additionally, many schools
are able to capitalize on the fact that
they have a larger black iaculty and
can thus attract even more black pm,
fessors.

The institution of a larger number of
black-oriented courses has met with
the greatest success. McKinnon said
the college is committed to adding
more of these courses The mayor
mrget is the AtrosAmerican Studies
Department, which is an inter
disciplinary concentration. cos wants
at least two blackrrelatcd courses
taught per semester. However, once
again, the problem is that there are
few qualified professors on campus to
teach them.

Finally, the organization aims to in-
crease campus awareness of CBS and
the Cultural Center by exposure to the
remainder of the campus body
through such programs as the two ma
jor weekends. Equally important are
all-campus parties, lectures, and
speakers, which are presented
throughout the year “We just want to
encourage the campus community to
ask us about CBS and to come over to
the Cultural Center and find out what
we’re about,” stated McKinnon.

Although some students perceive the
organization as being segregationist,
McKinnun remarked, “We’re working
to cater to the special needs and 1H7
terests of minority students that SGA
can't reach.”

ing social, cultural, and political
events which are in essence, an ex-
pression of our innermost feelings,
these endeavors will prove to be ad
vantageous to not only the black
students, but the campus as a whole.
The Black Cultural Weckend is one of
these types or events.

This weekend is a time ior enjoy»
ment, as well as a time to learn about
the black experience. The iollowlng is
