Wall Drake says will ”have as free a
hand as possible in designing the pro-
gram ”

Although Wall says. “I still only
have a general idea of what the pro»
gam w1ll be like,” he nonetheless sees
several pluses to the new program. He
thinks it will be a “fine elaboration"

from the editor

This week’s 8&8 is only eight pages due to production pro-
blems relating to the Thanksgiving holiday. Because of these
problems, we were not able to cover Wednesday’s Forum drink-
in as we would have liked.

The big news this issue is the return of Joe Wall, who will
head the college’s new program in public affairs, The program
was set up by the trustees to honor Joe Rosenfield, one of Grin-
nell’s major benefactors, and to improve the college’s public af»
fairs offerings

Also, in focus this week, is an article on facts and fiction con-

Schultz researched and wrote the article.

“alternative newspaper" and finds it sadly lacking—in the ideas
section.

By the way: for those who were looking forward to the “fall
literary supplement," it will be part of the December 7 58:13.
Better late than never.
