Tull review misses mark

' ‘To the editor: Although as a Jethro
Tull tanatlc I enjoyed the recent
r‘eview of Storiiiii-atch. I think it was a
little 0“ the mark, I can’t disagree
withvyour interoretations~i don't even
own the album- but I think Ian Anderr
son does.

Iln-a recent interview for the Parrie
sin (a Midwest rock rag), Anderson is
asked if “the message oi Storiiiwatcli
is that we are about to run out oi
petroleum, and into a new ice age?”
(Where did we hear that interpreta
tion bei'ore'l !) Anderson replies:
".Well, i think you're being a little bit
dramatic about your interpretation, In
“North Sea Oil,” ior example, I'm On-
ly relerring to the pecularitles ol the
British Alliance, economically speak-
mg.”

3 Anderson didn't sound too serious
about the ice age either: His exact
words: “I certainly don’t expect
(another ice age) for another six-
thousand years. And I doubt it I sllall
be around then Certainly not if the
critics have their way." Good luck

To the editor: For the last few days,

Molho misunderstands world politics

To the editor: There are a few things
bothering me this week, and one of
them is David Molho’s Iran editorial
oi last week. David speciiically adr
vocated the use of U.S. Marines to
rescue the hostages held in the u s.
Embassy in Tehran, Such a policy
would be ill advised and counter»
productive,

David is right that the invasion of
an embassy is against international
law, and that it is an act of terrorism.
However, it David had been under an
absolute dictator’s rule (or 25 years,
he might be less disposed to worry
about the applicable international law
in the situation. This would be
especially true in relation to the own
try responsible for supporting this dicr
tator through the years. Yes, you
guessed it, that country is the us. In
1953. the CM. was mainly responsi-
ble for the Shah’s overthrow oi the
democratically elected government of
Mohammed Mossadeq It hardly

To the editor: There are a few things
that are bothering me this week. Some
are very serious, and some aren’t so
serious, and one is David Molho.
Molho's perspective oi the current
situation between the United states
and Iran would seem to reduce the
delicate matter of international rela»
tions to a playground sculllc. As he so

they oppressed.

But now to the use of Marines:
David doesn't understand the political
implications of the situation. The
Ayatolluh Khomeini is using the
Shah’s Us Visit to try and cement his
own power in Iran by turning the peo-
ple’s attention trom his government to
a scapegoat, the us. Iran's Prime
Minister, Mehdi Bazargan, and his
government resigned over this. The
Ayatolluh is becoming politically
isolated inside Iran; he will not rule

now to save himsell, and the continued
escape ol the Shah from justice is the

position when any tlyspecked little

gross oversimpliflcation. It should also
be noted that the “Ilyspecked little

Mollio’s reliance upon ”international
law" is also rather irrelevant, and, as
we shall see later, inconsistent. Yes,
the American embassy and those who
