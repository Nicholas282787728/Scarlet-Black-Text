'B&S: slanderous and unworthy of support

' to the editor: I'd like to respond to
the’attack on SGA from the staff
members of the B 8: S. They contend
that Joint Board‘s refusal to give them
money “amounts to an attempt to
stomp out opposing positions and to .
maintain the dreary status quo.”

Although I question now, as I did at
the meeting, the validity of an anar-
‘chist organization coming to an
organized democratic body for fund-
ing, I'd like to point out mat the lack
oi monetary support did not come
because of opposing political view-
points, but because the Board seemed
to feel that the first issue of the B St S
was slanderous at best, malicious, and
not worthy of being supported.

As to the charge of maintaining the
status quo, I’d like to remind the
editors that Joint Board has, in the
past, supported alternative publica-
tions, The Gadfly as a case in point,
and will probably continue to do so if

Skip Day spirit lacking

To the editor: For those of us who can
recall Grinnell students who lamented
the decline of revolutionary fervor on
campus with real alarm rather than
the currently fashionable nostalgia,
the recent Skip Day can be regarded
as nothing less than a corrupt and
blasphemous event.

Never mind the fact that the
veneration of’the perceived expres-
sions of the “flower culture” has
degenerated into vandalized lawns and
day-glow paintings on Republican
faces. Ignore, too, the widespread ate

itendance of classes and the general
“business as usual" attitude so suc
cessfully promoted by the campus

, Establishment.

, . Forget even that the very term
“Establishment” suggests more
strongly paranoia on the part oi the
one using it ﬁlan the undeniable ex~
istence ot a powerful vested interest in
the status quo, We Still must face one
fact that no honest Grinnellian can ig-
nore: Skip Day was a dud.

And why? The music on the lawn
was louder and better than ever, yet
fewer sat and listened. The sun was
warm and the day perfect, yet many
enjoyed it only as they scurried off to
lab. Gone were me traditional
‘la‘mens at the scarcity oi
hallucinogens; instead, we heard the
complaints of the dealers who couldn’t
unload.

The answer is simple: some respon-
sible person or group preferred the
egoistic glory of telling friends when
Skip Day was coming to the 135 visi-
ble satisfaction of pleasantly surprisA
ing everyone. Everyone I saw told me
'on' Friday that Tuesday would be,
weather permitting, Skip Day.

. in contrast, consider 1976, when the

it feels there is some political or social
worth to the publication.

Personally. I teel that there is a
place for an alternative publication,
especially for “a forum for creative
expression of uncommon views,"
however, the B 8: 5, thus far, does not
seem to be what it it claims.

I'd also like to add that, initially

having felt the idea behind the B & S
was worth funding, and after reading
the first issue and how the staff of the
B dz S feels about Joint Board, l intend
on suggesting to the Board that if the
subject ever comes up again, that it
tells the B & S staff members to find
tunds from those whose position they
don’t find putrid, Maris Natker

Claims facts in draft commentary misleading

To the edi r: I found the topic of
last week’s open space, “Confronting
the draft,” extremely interesting,
although 1 disagree with the authors’
conclusions. If the authors' realized
that the Individual Ready Reserves
are unpaid people who have not re
enlisted, they could not reasonably
base their arguments on lRR »
availability. Further, the statistics
they used regarding the IRR are

significantly incorrect and misleading,

a lunatic pounding on dorm doors and '
yelling “To the Pub!” at 9 pm. when
the event is known in advance, it
ceases to be spontaneous in the least;
rather, it becomes a predictable op-
portunity to catch up on one’s studies.
Work is postponed with Skip Day in
mind, and the day itself is destroyed
The spirit of Skip Day has been
cruelly raped by the dark iorces of
pre-medical Disco and creeping
Republicanism. Skip Day needs no [lf'
ficial sanction, no SGA money for beer

in concluding, i would wish that
from this time forward. well-meaning
student “activists" would realize that
people are entitled to their own opinr
ions but not to their own facts. In
order to avoid the greatest infringe—
ment of libertyiwar and oppressive
subjugationia peacetime draft
registration may be necessary. It so,
I will support it, “not to promote war,

or bands. Celebration is less tangible
than toilet»papered trees and stand-in-
line beer.

A far better Skip Day could be had
as it once was-with a budget of $10 for
printlng signs and a group of responsi-
ble people planning in secret. The
students of Grinnell should not stand
for this humiliating debacle! er
PEACH THE SKIP DAY COMMlTr

Leadership ain’t what it 'Youtz’ to be

To the editor: Well, the red-haired
Messiah strikes (out) again. Last
week, a quotation from David Kramer
appeared in the s & B's article on Skip
Day. In what has to be the silliest
statement or his career, Kramer label
ed almost all the people who went to
class mat day “nerds.”

Incredible, Here we have the SGA
president insulting at least one-third of
the student body. Really inspires con-
fidence in one's leadership, doesn’t it?

Let me remind Mr. Kramer of a tew
things. First of all, Grinnell College is
primarily an academic institution,
much as we would like to forget it.
People come here to earn degrees, not
just to blow up balloons or paint
sidewalks.

of course it’s great to have diverr
sions like Skip Day, but that's all they
should be diversions. To lose sight
of the principle goals of a Grinnell
education would be fully.

If I had wanted a school where the
emphasis was on partying and toilet
paper assaults, I would be attending a
place like Southern lllinois University,
reputed to be the number one party
school in the country.

Yes, Skip Day is an enjoyable in-
stitutlon. and I don’t begrudge this
semester’s skippers their frolic. Yet it
bothers me to hear other students
criticized so harshly for fulfilling their
academic obligations,

Does Kramer think that those of us
who sweated Tuesday afternoon away
in biology labs or studying in Burling
really preferred to be there? Sure, we
were tempted to join in all the fun out
side the Forum, but concern over mid-
sems can he a pretty effective deter-
rent to Skip Day madness.

Regardless of Kramer’s claim that
“if nobody goes to class, there is no
class,” many professors continue to
hold students responsible for work
missed on Skip Day.

Kramer's comments were uncalled
for and irresponsible, If the Messianic
hope sincerely wishes to be an effec-
tive representative of the student
body, he would be well advised to
start showing some sensitivity
towards student concerns.

Otherwise, he may soon hear quite a
few of us “nerds” complaining that
SGA’S leadership ain't what it Youtz
to be. sincerely. Melissa L Wyllie
