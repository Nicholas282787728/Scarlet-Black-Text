The Lawrence Vikings built a
large first half lead and held on to
beat Grinnell, 24712, last Saturday
at Lawrence.

Staying mostly on the ground,
the Vikings put all oftheir pointsﬂn
the scoreboard before Grinnell had
any. Two oneryard touchdown
runs, a short scoring pass, 1 rec
onerpoint conversions, and a i
goal came in the iirst hall and gave
Lawrence the lead,

The Grinnell offense was almost
totally ineffective in the first three
quarters against the tou h
Lawrence defense. The Pior. Ir

were able to shut off the Grinnell
running attack.

Grinnell had a net total of onlytts

three first downs on the grow .
The Vikings also put a heavy rush
on Crane in the fist three quarters,
thus hindering the passing game as
well. The Pioneers recorded only
