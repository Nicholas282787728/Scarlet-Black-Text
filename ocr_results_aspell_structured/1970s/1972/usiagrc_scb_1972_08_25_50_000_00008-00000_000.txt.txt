.Eew There To Cheer -

"The Thrill 0i Agony and the Ecs-
tacy ot Defeat" - this poetic injus-
tice invoked by oft-quoted Grinnell
athlete/scholar Chris Madson<72)
is an expression quite applicable
to the feelings confronting that at-
hlete participating in cross country
distance running. For him there is
little glory lauded before cheering
crowds; rather the rewards come
on a deep personal level with the re-
cognition OI sell—confidence and the
knowledge of sell-fulfillment, At

ot personal goals, "It is a tough,
demanding sport," says Obermille

In reflecting upon the upcoming
: cross country season Obermiller
finds, at this pointxthat, ”It’s just
a question mark.” The team effort
may be hampered early in the year
by health problems and a lack or
by depth, ”This is one or the least
experienced teams Grinnell has had

in the last tour or live years." But

spirit, and (Madson‘s First Law)

This brings up an important point,

and with so many newcomers now
arrivmg this is a good time to
stress it. AS ohormilter puts it,
”The great part ol Grinnell ath-
letics is that there is a great opp-
ortunity tor someone who's never
tried athletics to come out.” This
isn't yust talk, it’s true. And oper»
miller believes that it’s particularly
true for cross county, where
“everyone gets to participate."

onermiller hopes not only that wome

able to participate with men in
competition ranging trom tennis to
track. In considering his own role
as cross country coach, Obie
