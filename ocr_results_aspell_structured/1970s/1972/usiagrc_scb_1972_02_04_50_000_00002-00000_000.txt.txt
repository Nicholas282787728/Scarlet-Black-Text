_ The Scarlet and Black

Joint Board

Monday members of the Joint Board discussed the grading pros
posal that will soon be approved by the Educational Policies

Committee.

This discussion is the first of several which they

will have of matters under consideration by Committees. Several
students, including some members of the Joint Board, participated
in a group discussion or the issue during the previous week, They
brought to the Board a report of the major questions and issues
they had discussed and considered significant; house presidents
were able to begin their discussion at that point.

Several such study groups will probably meetduring the semester.
Their activities will enable the Board as a whole to take informed

action to prod the committees.

Committees could be urged to

consider certain ideas or to take specific positions on issues they

already are discussing.

We favor the Joint Board's approach. It is a method which Will
help make our present committee structure work as well as pos

sible.

We hope that the discussion groups will continue to deal with
fairly Specific and well-defined issues. More is to be gained by
encouraging rather specific actions than by encouraging something
as undefined as “a full discussion ot academic pressure at Grin-

nell’ ’.

If the Joint Board divides such issues into their various

aspects and encourages discussion of the most important of those,
student government could accomplish great things this semester.

Survey Grad Students

Attitudes or America’s graduate
students on topics including the value
of their undergraduate and graduate
careers, student activism, and per»
sonal goals were surveyed by the
American Council M Education Al-
though taken in the spring or 1969, the
recently published survey contains
numerous valuable insights that are
still applicable.

The 33,000 students were divided
into nine tield categories which re-
veal consistent views on all the
al background. Law students, social
scientists, and art and humanity mas
jors professed basically liberal
ideas, while business engineering,
and education students tell on the
more conservative side (lithe scale.
Traditionally the law and business
students have had quite similar bar
lieis, Among the questions were in,
quiries about the motivations they
had for going to school, Law and
business students, 80.2 and 72.8
respectively, were in graduate
school for the prestigous job that
would result. The desire to continue
intellectual growth and increase
earning power were cited by approx-
imately 90 percent or those sur
veyed

One of the major factors foralmnst
60 percent otthose surveyed was that
through schooling they could Contrir

bute to society. Approximately three
quarters or all law and social science
students professed this belief. Three
quarters of the sample believe that
they could serve mankind by
pursuing a graduate degree, although
only one half the business students
held this view. Surprisingly, about
half believe that realistically an in-
dividual can do little to change soc—
iety.

There were many issued raised that
are worth noting, including;

,. Oyer one half favored giving
undergraduates a controlling role
or voting power in decisions on stu—
dent discipline.

-- Over one third approved unre-
servedly or with reservations of
emergence of radical student acti»
vism of recent years with one half
of the law and social science stu-
dents responding favorably.

-- Nearly one third believed that it
is all right to get around law it you
don’t break it. Business and law stue
dents were the greatest supporters
of this idea.

"Forty-four percent believe there
is too much concern in courts {or
rights of criminals although only
18.6 percent of the law students

agreed.
-- Only 39.x percent would delin-

itclv choose the same discipline it
academic training started again.

oh the day when all the law

Stuff

BEST DOG: Bullet, Rin Tin Tin
(Rinny), and Lassie.

Bullet proved best.

BEST HORSE: Trigger, Buttercup,

silver, Fury, and the horse that
carried Jingles.
Fury won hoofs down. Trigger
couldn’t even keep up with Bullet
in a footrace, Jingle’s horse was
always trying to catch up to Wild
Bill, Buttercup lost on name alone,
and l have inside intormation that
Silver was bleached.

BEST SIDEKICK: Jingles, Tonto,
Gabby Hayes, Chester, and Ber-
nardo (the mute trom Zorro).
Tonto’s grunt would have been
enough, but he clinched the award
in this scene:

Lone Banger: Everyone is dead?
Captain Reader was my brother.
Tonto: mmm. Too bad.

BEST LINE: Oh Pancho, oh Cisco.
Hey wild Bill, wait tor me. Wool,
Woof (Lassie). Here girl (to Las
sie). Heigh—o Silver, away. Move

Someone always stole the gas from

pair or suspenders. But the river-
boat kept aerollin' along.

Penny ran a close second tor ale
ways being by the radio transmits
ter, but Dale was queen. She was
the liberated woman at old wes-
terns. She wore pants and always
had the Sons otthe Ploneers do the
cooking. She was tough and shot the
gun out or the hand or any hombre
(she never killed) who threatened
her Roy. Notice her last name is
Evans, not Rogers. For all we
know they may have yust been

SOUND EFFECTS WINNERS: Slash

This is to inlorm you that education
and viable lile styles exist outside
the ivy covered, gargoyle-embel-
lished walls of Grinnell College.
True, having left the Harvard ot
the Midwest we realize that access
to its counterparts in the Ivy League
and to the better high schools in the
environs of Evanston, Illinois will
forever be denied us Alas.

Here amidst the Goyem, (forget not
the Flrst~~and lath-"amendments
ye liberals), cradle of reactionary
dogma, we live as did those great
American Nobel Prize winners sans
Pearl Buck. This place is the center
of such mum-levelled conscious-
ness and tree expression that has not
been seen since Scott and Ernest
were in Paris after the Great War.
Here, Male Chauvinism is supreme
and women mind the stove and liberr
ate themselves in the traditional
roles. Here the counter culture sits
directly at the counter.

Friday night, January 28, saw the
Manhattan Quartet give their concert
in the second weekend of the charm
ber Music Festival. The group,
originally from the Manhattan School
of Music, gave a technically pror
ficient, but dull, performance.

The Hayden Quartet No. 46, Opus
20, No. 4, lacked an emotional ele-
ment. The Quartet played every note
right, but had no “soul” that turns
those notes into music.

Bartok, which is supposed to be
their forte and of which they played
the Quartet No. 6, came on as a
piece played only note for note, or,
in the words of one person, it was
as if they decided beforehand to play
it section by section without con—
necting the sections with the whole,

The Ravel was overdone. This was
Ravel’s only Quartet and the Marie
hattan Quartet milked it for all it
was worth.

I feel some of the fault for the
dullness was where the concert was
held v in Herrick The Herrick
acoustics are not known for their
brilliance. All things considered,
the Manhattan String Quartet was a
proficient group who happened to be
dull ,, but not to the point or boring
people.

Sun., noon~2, 5‘8 p.rn.
