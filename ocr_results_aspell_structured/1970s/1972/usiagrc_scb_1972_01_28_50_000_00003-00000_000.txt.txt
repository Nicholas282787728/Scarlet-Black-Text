semester SGA budget, the allotment i“
of funds for a guest speaker, and a
discussion of the priorities for this
semester highlighted the Joint Board
semester highlighted the Joint
Board’s meeting Monday night in
Burling basement.

Mr. James Magee (Political Sci-
ence) requested $200 from SGA funds
to supplement funds already re-
ceived from PPPE, the initiative
Fund, and other sources on campus
to finance the appearance of Neil
Sheehan. Sheehan, a Pulitzer prize
winner for his coverage of the Viet-
nam War, presently writes for the
New York Times and is known as the
journalist who broke the Pentagon
Papers. Expenses and Sheehan’s fee
will amount to approximately $550.
and will insure an all—campus ap»
pearance in addition to smaller
meetings with student groups includ-
ing Mr. Magee and Mr. Jones' Cold
War Seminar. The motion to grant
the funds wasunanimously approved.

Budget discussion was next on the
agenda with George Shybut, chair-
man of the Finance Committee, pre~
senting the budget for the spring of
1972. The most significant change
in the proposed budget from last
semester's is the deficit which will
run somewhere between $477 and
$595 depending upon the final en-
rollment for this semester. There
is a $50 increase in funds for the‘
Student Coordinator’s Office to
finance the three new assistant co-
ordinators who are replacing Terry
Clifford and Craig Hugisaki. There
will also be an $80!) decrease in
KDIC funds.

Shyout also proposed the adoption
of the policy of zeroing of all ac-
counts at the end of the semester.

Yearbook To Ilse
Community-Thom

Question: What’s been missing at
Grinnell for the last thrceyears?
If you said “the National Pinball
Superbowl” you were wrong. The '
correct answer is a yearbook.

After three years on leave (due
to lack of interest) the “Grinnell
Book” has returned, or at least
about 300 subscribers hope so. The
theme of the ‘71-’72 yearbook will
be “Community.”

Its new format will break away own
the traditional layout, where hails,‘
athletics and other activities form
neat categories. Instead, phenomena
that characterize a community, such
as growth, change, conﬂict, cooper»
ation, and competition will be porL
trayed in text and photography.

“We’re attempting to have a year-
book that will be an artistic work
as well as a record," said Raul
Doughty, photography editor. Duo-
tone prints and panoramas of the
campus instead of the usual dis- .
connected fragmentations will be
featured. ,>

Because money and space are lie
mited, it will be up to the seniors
themselves this year to see that
they get their picture taken by
contacting editorsin-chief Martha
Wacker or Paul. They would ’ap~
preciale receiving any student art—
work or photography which can he
submitted to Box 12222.

The yearbook is financed by' ads,

his plan would result in the SGA
taking back all funds not used dur-
‘ing the semester and reallotting
them to those groups that need
further funds. It would also present
the accumulation of funds by cer—
taih organizations. By zeroing the
accounts, approximately another
$1000 would be given to the Hall
Fund'account, whose funds were
rapidly depleted last semester. The
proposed budget and the adoption
of aeroing of accounts was unani-
mously approved. ‘

A proposal to release 3100 from

General Budget and Reserveto cover
the damage to the squash equipment
incurred by the P E, department
will be acted on in the future when
more inlormnticn is received by the
Joint Board. _

During the remainder of the meet
ing the priorities for this semester
were discussed, The consensus was
that the important issues this see
mester will be attemtlng to reform
the present academic calendar, find
a new credit system, and investiga»
ting the DOSSIbiiities for more in-
dependents like the 12 credit Rus»
sian History course.

McGovern Supporters Meet

, The McGovern supporters on cam»
pus, as well as intermediate number
of others, met in the South Lounge
last Thursday afternoon in the first
of a series of weekend meetings and
quasi-caucuses that led to the pre»
cinct mEetings Monday night.

A scheduled speaker from the Mc-
Govern national campaign failed to
show up--he had car trouble-~but
almost all of the 40-45 students
stayed for aﬁout an hour’s worth of
organized pep talk from Mary
Sweeney, Mia Voertman, and Jack
Doppelt. ,

Many Sweeney gave an opening talk
which concentrated mainly on Mc-
Govern’s .‘ impressive list oi
"firsts,” mentioning among other
things that he was the first Demo»
crat to be elected to the Senate from
his state, South Dakota; that he was a
principal architect of the new "open

- convention’ procedures that the
Democrats will supposedly follow
this year; and, of course, that he has
been an early and consistent oppo-
nent of the war in Vietnam.

' Jack Doppelt then assessed Mc-
Govern's position in the primaries.
To a degree, Doppelt denigrated the
importance of New Hampshire and
Florida; where McGovern will al~
most certainly do badly, and
stressed instead the primaries in
McGovern‘s home area of the Mid—
west. Doppelt laid particular empha-
sis on Wisconsin; saying that Mc-
Govern people there gave the state
crucial importance in the campaign.

Mr. Voertrnan spoke to the question
of McGovern's showing in the polls,
which is pretty dismal. He urged
students not to switch to other can»
didates, specifically Muskie, if their
only reasonlor doing so were 'fear
of being stuck ,with a loser. Voert-
man said the “minimum” he can
personally do is to, stick with a cane

‘ didate when his position accorded

with his own, and he implied strong—
ly that others should do likewise.

About forty students, most of them
McGovern supporters, met in the
South'Lounge Sunday night to hear
Greg Vrahicar outline themechan-
ics of the precinct caucus that took
place Monday, Immediately follow—

SGA funds and subscriptions..Des»" ,

pite a rather late start, the Staff -

hopes to have the book out by the.
second week in May.

lhg Vranicar, Tom Souttiwick of the
national McGovern campaign staff
held a question-andsanswei‘ session
about his candidate,

Vraniear held the meeting to fa»
miliarize those students who wanted
to attend the caucus with the situa—
tion they would confront. He also
distributed an outline of caucus pro-
cedures and regulations (which, ins
cidentally, bore only a superficial
resemblance to the way Dick Sans
ders, first ward committeeman, ace
tually conducted the caucus)

The meetings major achievement
was clarification of the residency
requirement. The party, it des
veloped, was willing to let all elie
gible voters participate in the caus
cus, regardless of where they would
vote in November, The only proviso
was that participation in the caucus
would mean disqualification from
voting in primaries outside Iowa ._
in a primary, for example.

lEAP, PR Office Recycle Paper

Grinnell has been doing a lot of paper work lately -- almost nine tons’
worth, to be exact That’s the amount of waste paper reclaimed on campus
by LEAP during the last semester, and sent out for recycling

The mixed paper collected during the foursmonth period up to Dec, 18 came
to 6,830 pounds; newspapers, 7,220 pounds; colored ledger paper, 3,100
pounds; and white ledger, 410 pounds. The total was 17,550 pounds, Or just
under nine tons, in addition, there are several thousand pounds of paper that
have not yet been sold for recycling.

The persmonth collection for the second semester should be about three
tons.

The College is increasingly using recycled paperfor its publications, Among
these iS the pripewinningas-page admissions booklet -- ”The Sharingoi
Grinnell” .. whose 15,000 copies were printed on stock made from the loo
per cent reclaimed waste paper.

The rationale for this was that the

Democratic party was anxious to
have everyone participate in some
form of prevelection activity, to
delegate selection, and wanted to
make the procedure tor doing so
open and easy.

When Vranicar finished, Torn
Southwick, a McGovern campaigner
from Harvard, talked with the heaVle
1y prosMcGovern audience about
their mutual candidate SoulhwiCI-t
emphasized McGovern’s integrity
and denied that he could not will in
