Editing the 5443 this year has been in challenging, sometimes
hectic, and very worthwhile experience for us. But tlle task,
completed now except for the final, Commencement issue to be
published May 23, would have been impossible without the detllr
-cated help we have received from those whose writings and
pictures have appeared on these pages week after week.

We could not begin to estimate the amount of work required to
produce a single issue of the 5&3, but each article represents
a commitment of time which is significant and frequently consule»
rable Even a short article can require two to three hours of
research, and reporters have to complete their stories by a
definite deadline k in addition to their own always pressing
academic responsibilities. Photographers often get too little
credit, because they can put much effort into taking and processing
pictures,only to discover that the pictures did not turn out as
expected. Those whose names have appeared on the masthead
through the year deserve to be recognized as having contributed
to the Grinnell community; Without their help there would have
been no newspaper.

Special thanks are due to those who have contributed articles
or columns almost every week and to those who have helped us
with assignments, copy reading, and layout. These people have
helped us even when they have been very busy with academic work,
and for them academic work must and should come before the sols.

We would be remiss if we did not especially mention those liidlr
viduals whose contributions to the 8&8 have consistently been
far beyond what could reasonably be expected from them, Terry
Wolf was invaluable to us as assignments editor for the first half
of this semester. Dori Dagenais, who has been our copy editor
all year, has helped us throughout with many different aspects
of the paper. Finally, John Wylie has earned his title of Associate
Editor; with out his skillful reporting, his uncallny ability to
uncover important stories, and his willingness to take important
assignments on short notice, this year’s 8&3 would have lacked a
great deal.

Mr. John Morrissey, publisher of the Montezuma Republican, and
the people at the Republican and the Sutherland Printing Company
who have worked on our paper have been more than helpful to
two editors who knew virtually nothing about the technical aspects
of printing and the newspaper business whenthey began the editor-
ship last August.

We thank all members of the college community for their patient
cooperation with us and our staff throughout the year. We have
done our best to provide fair, accurate, and complete coverage of
campus news, as well as an open forum for the expression of
opinion. We hope we have not fallen too far short of your expecr
tations.

The Scarlet and Black:

Upping The Ante

Mr. Nixon made it clear that his decision is irrevocable unless
two conditions are met: the release of all prisoners of War and
an internationally supervised ceaseefire. Hanoi has shown repeatedly
that it is not impressed by force, however. Each new US. initiae
tive on the battlefield has only hardened the resolve of the North
Vietnamese and the Viet Cong. For this reason, the llkllllood that
the administration's decision to mine the harbor will force the
enemy to capitulate seems slim.

Prisoners of war have been the biggest problem for the adminis-
tration, of course. And it is a virtual certainty that they will be
kept by North Vietnam until U.S. withdrawal is complete. As to
the proposal for an internationally supervised cease-fire, the idea
should be appealing to all concerned. On that point, the North
Vietnamese would be wise to agree.

What will happen next is anybody‘s guess. Whether or not the
President made the right move can be debated at length, but only
the results will show that. Yet there can be no doubt that the U.S.
has upped the ante. And the history of this abominable war shows
that escalation has not hastened its end.

We fervently hope that what has taken place will not lead to an
even graver international situation, though that possibility is very
real indeed. And if it crumbles whatlittle progress has been made
in the area of US. relations with Moscow and Peking, then all
the people of the world are losers.

Suggests lhett Precautions

To the Editors:
Another weekend has gone Iiy. nnd
nun-c motel-hi1 goods ui-c missrnp
liurn student lomils. ll saddens me
to think that there are students on
this campus Wllo would steal liorn
their fellow students just to innke

n buck, but lguess that's a . d
reality 1 linve to lnce up to. What
saddens me more is thin students
who have things 11])de on don‘t
report lt‘tu d> tlle police and h)
college officials, and that those
students who know who the offenders
are don't say something to some-
body Go get these lliillltual stealr
ers off this campus lMMEDIATELY!
It is up to us, the students, to put
an end to all this outright burglary,
for if we do not do so, more of us
will lose Oill' villued stereos or gulr
this (And 1 don‘t mean neccss
only that these goods have only a
monetary value You all know how
treasured anything that makes music
is around Grinnell )

Let me, their, other some sug
gestions to tile student body nt
large:

1. Report all missing items to
(at lenst) your RA and the Dean
of Students Office lftlle item war~
rants it, call tlle police. They are
very friendly and are quite Willing
to help find your stolen article(.s)
2 if you know anything at all about
some stolen goods; it i your duty
to report this information to your
Student Adviser. RA, or House
President. Someday, if something of
yours gets ripped off. you’ll wish
someone would give you a lead.
3 Don't be afraid to challenge a
suspicious looking person Walking
around tlle dorm, I know that’s n
rattler vague category, but it'sille
end ot the year and someone wnlk-
ing with a turntable ought to at
least be taken hole of.

4 Don't buy anything you ttlink
might be not. You can he nabbed
by the police [or receiving stolen
goods, which is a crime. And re
port it (RA, sn, up, police, etc.)
if you think someone was trying to
sell you a hot iteln.

We‘ve got to catch tllis sienling
business righr now, before it gets
uny worse. I think that most or us
would like to return to the days
of first semester when we could go
to class and ienve our doors open
(not only unlocked) and when We
could go to the bathroom without
having to worry about whether we
should have locked our doors. How-
ever, we can't just think about how
idyllic it was then. We have to Do
something to change the present
situation’

Criticizes Worley

To the Editors:

when I ran for next year’s philor
sophy sec 1 did so hoping that i
could reverse the department’s de-
cislon to oust ltlan Nasser. Ibe-
cnme a major largely because of
excellent courses l had had and

anticipated having hpm him. Need; ‘

less to say, i have some reactions
to the newest recommendation of
the philosophy department, Clearly
the department's action challenges
the EFC'S recommendation that Mr.
Nasser be offered n two-year non-
terminal contract. This recommen-
dation was based on a poll of majors,
the results oi which appeared in last
week’s article. Brietly, well over
any, of the majors desired Mr.
anser to stay.

of the year, it seems that many
people are so removed {rpm the

can assure you that it is real,
but that is not enough, yoll must
come to that realization yarn-sell.
You lnust think about what you see,

it you people wnnr the war to end
you will have to venture from the

gives you from the criccrs of war
and impress upon yourselves und

to change your complacent nriilude

possibly he reelected. You now have
the vote and the opportunity to use
it for something you claim to believe
in It you do not take advantage

This calls into question the seri-

Remarks

At the mass meeting when u was
decided that the Nasser case was
reopened it certainly was not stipur
lated that a reaction as overwhelm»
ingly favorable as this would not
he deClslve. in speaking with Mr.
Worley and in listening to his taped
interview 1 can only conclude that
he Lind the department are equiiwr
caring on the notion of how student
sentiment is determined; that he is
making the [ﬁndings of the poll seem
ambiguous when they are crystal
clear. Mr. Worley will argue, for
instance, that most instructors get
only a 27% “bad" response whereas
Nasser’s “bad" response is no
lower than 17% among majors. From
this he concludes that Mr. Nasser
is “above average" as an instruc-
tor. Wrong-Jim two polls are not
comparable! We were not making a
comparative judgement about Nas-
ser's teaching ability, in the sense
that the usual Student evaluation
[orm does. Rather, we were afﬁrms
ing our inith in his teaching and
recommending that he be offered
a two—year non-terminal contract.
Why attempt to analyze the EPC'S
recommendation as anything but
that? Certainly We were aware when
we were being polled that we were
judging much more than classroom
competence: we were announcing
that we wanted Mr. Nasser to stay.
i suppose that the department
members could opt tor a defense
of their action based on the arguA
ment that they have no responsir
billty in the hiring and firing or
sin", that they are merely express-
ing an opinion. But such defense
would evade tlle question or respon-
sibility. The fact is that by recom-
mending to tile Executive Council
that Mr. Nasser be given a one,
your terminal contract the depnrb
ment has taken a ginnr, ii not den
cisive, step in the removnl oer.
Nasser. The department has embar-
ately disregarded (or nlisihtei»
preted) that sentiment.

Certainly students acknowledge the
fact that they are being polled, that
they are being consulted, and they
are being asked to interview We
renrinl replacements for Nasser.
However, our central concern is that
Mr. Nasser be kept at Grinnell and
that the faculty’s recommendation
be reversed. Given the successive
appearance or charges raised
against Nasser, i can only con—
clude that the department has lust
its perspective and now molds its
arguments to its desire to get rid
oi Nasser.
