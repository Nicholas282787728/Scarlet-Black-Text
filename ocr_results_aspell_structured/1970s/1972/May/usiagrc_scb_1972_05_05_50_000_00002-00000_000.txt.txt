Chemistry Research Proiects Continue

by Merry Wiesner

Three members oi the chemistry
department uill he using students
to aid in summer research projects,
lauded by various agencies which
will continue along lines begun over
the past iew years

Mr Luther Erickson Will be con-
tinuing his work begun at years ago
on metalrkelate compounds. pitrtic»
uiarly investigating platinum com-
plexes 01 amino acids, Working
with John Gangei and Pete Nelson,
he will be synthesizingthese com
pounds and, through analyses at
their peculiar spectra, making oer
tailed assessments as to molecular
geometry

Mr, Erickson sees the student
input on this particular project as
assistance. Since the problems are
already well—deﬁned, he Views the
work this summer Asa testing sessV

rived from last summer's work to
the compounds themselves. Last
summer's results, hopeiully soon
to be published, drew some ten
tative conclusions on one particue
lar system oi compounds, and this
summer the team will be extend—
ing the Work to related com~
pounds.

Funded by the National Science
Foundation, Erickson's project can
be seen as pure research, with no
immediate applications, although
they will be exploring potentialities
in a variety oi areas.

Wuhhel‘s research ill the photos

be a continuation and broadening
of former work. Although there
is widespread research in thephotoe

that reaction occurs and exploring
the generality of that reaction.
Although no deilnlte conclusions
have been reached on the problem
to be explored this summer, protr

the initial problem has alreadvheen

Funded by an American Chemical

He added that those who invoke

,_ Gwendolyn Brooks, 1960

by Merry Wiesner

Gwendolyn Brooks, pultizer Prizer
winning poet here last weekend as
part oi Black Murtyr's Weekend,
sees her-sell lirst as block, and
then as a woman. She stresses
the tool that pocts liiust see them—
selves iis part at lhehiach comm,
unity, alid notes lllztt there seem
to be diiierent standards oi judip

ing black and white poetry. Al»
though she has been writing ior
nearly 40 years, this seliconsciuuse
ness grow out oi the 1967 black
wi-iters’ conioience at Fisk Univer-
sity, which was a turning point loi-
tier, giving herd new understanding
oi what was going on intiie world,

Although tier poetry oltentinies ree
veals the tact that she is a woman,
Miss Brooks doesn't see herseli
as having a “telltale eye."

In an eal'lyrmol‘lllllg rap session
Miss Brooks discussed hcrt aining
wltli a small, hilt enthusiastic group
oi about 25730. Site stressed the
importance or taking poetry to the
people, reading it in taverns and
parks and related some interesting
incidents about the reception that it
olten gets there.

lt'l’iilay evening she lolloued her
own advice alid presented a poetry
reading to a crowd which tilled the
South Lounge. .xlreliiely well re-
ceived by the entirc audience, she
told ol common problems, hopes
and tears. The tone at the whole
session, and. indccd, at lunch ol
hei- wilting, was expressed in the
title at one at her earliest yitlenlss-
