Faculty Reiects Credit Proposal

by Ann Cassel

Members of the faculty defeated a
motion to exempt certain depart-
ments from the 48 credit limitation
last Monday, and tabled a motion to
allow a student from each depart.
ment to be a voting member on die
visional Educational Policy Come
mittees. Exemptions of from the 48
credit limitation received the most
lengthy debate, The motion pre—
sented referred speciﬁcally to the
first 10 credits in introductory coure
ses in the Classics and Russian dee
Dartments.

The proposal was submitted to the
faculty by the Educational Policies
Committee, Two student members of
the EPC opposed the motion on the
basis that allowing for more than
48 credits in one department fails
to provide a well rounded liberal
arts education.

Two main reasons for the motion
were given by members ofthe Clas»

Anderson To Be
College Treasurer

Robert W. Anderson was named this
week to the position of Treasurer
of the College, President Leggett
has announced. Anderson, who cur-
rently serves as Controller of the
college, has been with Grinnell since
1968. Mr. Donald Lambie, who cur
rently holds the positions of Treae
surer and Vice-President for Bus-
iness, will continue to direct the fi»
nancial branch of the college man.
agement in his latter post.

Thomas R. Ackerman has been ap-
pointed Director of Annual Giving,
it was also announced, Ackermanhas
for the past three years been the
Director Of Alumni Affairs at Simr
pson College, and in his new post
will work in Grinnell's Development
office supervising the annual solici—
tation of funds from alumni, prie
vate donors, the industrial commune
ity, and other contributors.

sics department. Most students enr
tering the Clas 'cs department, they
said, have little or no preparation
in Latin or Greek so must learn
both languages before participating

in upper level courses, The tie»
partment also offers a much broader
area of study, including‘literature
and history, than just a basic lane
guage program.

Lack of preparation ofentering stuv
dents and the many faceted studies
in the department were also given
as reasons for a waiver of the lim-
itation in the Russian department.
Dennis Whelon, Assistant Professor
of Russian supported his case by
saying, “What would the English den
partment do if they had to teach
their students English before be
ginning substantive studies in the
field?”

Another point made by Whelan cone
cerned a semester in Leningrad open
to Students after Completion ofthree
years of study in the Russian lan—
guage. Grinnell students accepted in
this program would not be able to
count credits received, as they would
then exceed the 48 hour limitation
in the department

Crosselistlng of courses and pos
sible rulings by the Academic Stane
ding Committee to waive the credit
limitation in special cases were suge
gested as solutions to these probe
lems.

it was noted that in the past the
Academic Sanding Committee had
failed to allow any waivers of the
departmental credit limitation.

Professor of Physics Beryl Clote
felter then presented an amendment
to the original motion allowing for
those students taking introductory
courses in both Latin and Greek
to include only one of the languages
in the 48 credit limitation. The
amendment deleted any reference to
the Russian department. After some
discussion the amendment was de-
ieated almost unanimously.

A motion was made by John Wore
ley, Assoclate Professor of Phil~

 

 

Personal Perspective

 

 

osophy, to refer the proposal back
to the EFC, instructing the com-
mittee to discern what is meant by
“limitation.” He called the present
limitation a “spurious limit”, as
seriing that courses far exceeding
the limit could be taken in a diSA
cipline by cross—listing. “Saying
‘crosselist your way out ol it, boys’
is hardly legitimate legislation.”

After brief discussion he withdrew
his motion, feeling that the faculty
should discuss the limitation, not
the EPC The original motion was
defeated 20-2972.

The faculty voted to table another
motion presented by the EPC. This
proposal involved inviting a repree
sentotive from each department to be
a voting member on the divisional
EPC'S. The motion was tabled due
to a questioning as to whether di-
visional EPC'S would remain in ex-
istence.

Campus Atmosphere And
Student Behavior

by Ron Medvin

Late night in Clark Hall, most
everyone asleep. Suddenly, the fire
alarms shriek. there is a chilling
sound of a woman screaming, and
several girls open their doors to
find red paint splattered and dripping
on the floor. it is no coincidence
that these girls are those who had
testified at a Judicial Council hear»
ing held a few days before.

The first snowfall, an unexpected
blizzard brings out large groups of
students from North Campus. Tothe
sound of “charge” on a bugle, South
Campus is attacked. Although South
puts up a good fight, the contest is
brief and North emerges the victor.
A few lounges are wet with melting
snow and some loggia windows are
broken, but no one seems upset

It is obvious that these two inci-
dents are very different in nature.
The former appears to be a bla—
taut form of intimidation; students
being harrassed because oftheir ine
volvement in‘ campus judicial
proceedings, The latter is a spone
taneous effort that turned out to be
a great tension reliever. What is une
fortunate, however, is that there
have been too many cases of intim-
idation, vandalism, and malicious
behavior occurring on the campus
this Semester. If these activities
have not increased from previous
years, at least they seem to be more
noticed.

What are the reasons for this be
havior? Students have many opine
ions, “academic pressure", "not
enough to do socially", and “gen-
eral boredom and frustration within
the student body” It is obvious that
there is no one simple answer.
However, it does appear that stue
dent morale is low. Many students
here seem tired and disinterested
with Grinnell life, the attrition rate

is still high, The atmosphere on
campus, even on many weekends,
is heavy and often depressing.

it is this kind of atmosphere that
can lead to “campus rowdyism”,
for when the mood is low, students
more than ever need to burn off
steam. This is also the kind of at-
mosphere which often make inci-
dents seem worse than theyactually
are, word travels fast in a small
school and rumor is mixed with
fact until an incident is blown far
out of proportion. And while there
are some Students who infringe on
others’ rights, there are also those
who complain if the noise level rises
above the level of a church service.

President Leggett agrees that the
campus spirit is down, “The morale
is low...it has been a strange year
all through the academic world, The
number of unhappy students here is
greater than its ever been before. He
points out that students are often
worried about the value of a lib-
eral arts education; Jobs are hard-
er than ever to come by. and this
neWSA-true or notncan make astue
dent feel pretty insecure atacollege
like Grinnell But as to the low mor-
ale, Leggett says that “there is no
simple solution "

Leggett admits that there have been
a number of unusual incidents this
year. A senior girl was inyured
when a pumpkin was thrown at her
from a car as she crossed a street
Guns have been fired on the campus,
And students, ”especially in Raw-
son, Gates, Dibble, and Clark” have
been plagued with an excessive
amount of noise Some oftheseinci-
dents may not have been caused by
Grinnellians. Yet Leggett does feel
that some students haveparticlpated
in many acts of “freewheeling,
pointless vandalism. The amount of
furniture breakage this year is in-

credible,” he says.

He sees nothing wrong with a good
jag, but sees little humor in much
of what has gone on, Constantly set
ting off fire alarms is not funny;
it is pointless and annoying, not to
mention it being against the low,
And he makes it clear that intimi-
dation of students will not be tole
erated; the rights of all students
should be protected. Leggett is not
against anyone having a good time,
but all too often one person’s “good
time" infringes on the rights of
others living on the campus.

Are there any answers? As Leg»
gett said, simple solutions do not
exist. But he does have ideas. First
of all, while he feels that academic
pressures have not really increas-
ed over the years, pressure does
exist and this Creates tensions for
many students. Next semester, Leg-
gett thinks that the “deans and (as,
ulty should meet with students and
talk about what the professors ex-
pect from them. For example, a
prol should explain why he is as—
signing a paper or exam rind what
purpose it serves. Sometimes, stue
dents put pressure on each other!”
Tile relationship between students
and profs is lairly close, but ser-
ious meetings could help both stu-
dents and faculty alike.

There is also room for social
improvement, The amount of money
for social events has been raised
The Pub, if approved and construct-
ed, may help

Leggett has mixed feelings about a
campus pub if it turns into a place
where students go only to getdrunk,
“it could be a disaster " However.
the atmosphere could markedly im»
prove it the pub ”is operated as
it should be," Leggett says, It should
be an area where students and flic-
ulty can meet socially, where they

Alter hearing Mr. George Barlow
speak, one IS quite ready to under-
stand and believe the expresslon,
“the Lawd works in mysterious
ways.” Mr. Barlow captivated
his audience Wednesday night with
his first public reading, held approe
priately in the Black Library now
located in the Twentieth Century
Room.

With mastery, Mr, Barlowtrans-
ported his audience from the present
to the glories of the past and back
again. Colorful sketches of his
childhood in the California “Vil-
loge” were a cause of mixed emo-
tions Mr. Barlow's world is one
of pain/happiness/lire/death. He
does justice to each of these, With
his wife’s giving birth to a new
daughter, Erin Ayanna, his priori-
ties are redirectedon life, which he
tries to share with his audience.
He tells of the loving moments

Leggett does feel that there have
been cases of unnecessary vandal-
ism occurring this semester and that
solutions to curb this behaviormust
be worked out,

John Pfefter, an SGA Vice-Presie
dent, agrees with much of what
President Leggett says, but feels
that “rowdy behavior has not in»
creased this year. However, more
people are upset, and unusual ac—
tions are more noticeable. What
first may be funny gets redundant
and tiring when it's repeated over
and over again.” He agrees that
there are some rowdykids, but most
students are merely out for a good
time. ”It's healthy!” Often, they
have no place to go, and this is
where the problem lies, accordingto
Pfeffer, “Students are asking, one
way or another, for more things to
do;~sumething to excite them—eto
raise their morale.”

He feels that some students com-
plain about any form oibehaviorthat
is in any way out of the ordinary,
“It is important to recognizethedif—
lerence between a lag and malicious
or solely disruptive behavior,” he
says. Playing a tape of Tiny Tim’s
laugh at 3 am, from atop Goodnow
was a harmlesse-not to mention hyse
terical--gag that occurred two years
ago. Even setting off a fire alarm
can be funny, Piefier says, but when
it is repeated it becomes highly ane
noying and dangerous Students are
used to hearing the alarms, and are.
not responding to them, There could
be quite a disaster if there were a
tire and no one paid any attention
to the alarms, There is little chance
of a bad fire, but it is possible,
and it has happened before.

Pfeffer feels that some students
have unnecessary fears of others.
It is important that these students
“try to get rid of these fears,”
But there has been intimidation,
such as the Clark Hall incident
mentioned above. “These things
have to be prevented,” he says
lie also feels that ”there is a fear

Varied Emotions

Mr. Barlow displays a deep sensie
tivity to the problems that the brOe
titers and sisters of his national
family encounter. His beliefinpeo-
ple gives him a determination and
arrogance that is reflected in his
poetry. He says of himself con-
cerning his religion:

l'm hat religious m the traditional sense, but
[am a believer l believe in my loved ones
and myseli. and i believe that willie mad dog
oppression chn/wili_ he rlpnnu oll lam
religious

His constant Search for truth and
the affirmation of his Own beliefs
has led him to research and (levee
lop (for a poem) the history of one
of the largest attempted insurrec-
tions, led by Gabriel Prosser. Care—
ful research has led to the develop-
ment of a story that history has
found convenient to ignore. “Ga—
briel” constitutes the last section of
Mr. Bariow‘s book and is also the
title poem. The book Will be pub-
lished by Broadsides in Novemberof
1973.

Mr. Barlow sees history as a cone
tinum. The Gabriels, Nat Turner’s,
Denmark Vessey’s and many others
die, confident that they will be re-
surrected by the Don Lee’s, Nikki
Giovannis‘, Michael Harper's and
Goerge Barlow’s. It is ithe pen of
these writers that will begin to re
write the history of this country.
Their works are true expressions of
a nation waiting but ready to rise.

likely identical in nature and not
conscious enough of our own feele
lugs and expressions.”

Pfeffer sees two possible solue
tions to the low campus morale.
“The social activities fund needs
more money to expand and improve
the organized social events on came
pus. Also, we need to have more
personal communication between
students." it seems harder to make
close friends this year; people ape
pear more withdrawn. Noticing that
students open up within the social
atmosphere of the Longhorn, Pief—
fer feels that a campus pub could
help improve students' inter~per-
sonal relationships. “it's a place
that can provide a socialalternative,
Like the 'Horn, it will be a social
gathering place, and not a place to
get drunk.”

Pfeffer points out that the social
responsibi itiy should not be lelt only
to the social committee. ”Thereore
not enough hallactivitiesthis year,”

‘he says. “Where are the halldances,

coffee hours, and parties that we
used to have" Unlike past years,
there exists a “lack of spontaneity"
among students. We’re too serious,
and we worry too much about aca-
demics, it would be nice to eat a
meal at a table wllere the talk was
about something other than the
amount of work each student has to
do

But Pfeffer feels that some come
plaints of academic pressure are
justified, and that the facultyispal‘te
ly responsible. “Some profs appear
to want quantity, not quality,” he
says. “Profs should explaincourses
at the outset, providing a detailed
syllabus of course work, They should
explain the motives for papers (ind
exams, There is also a lack of my
terrelation between the social and
academic activities,”

The general conclusion reached
from all of this is that most evel'ye
one agrees that the spirit on the
campus this year is down; the more
ale is low, and too many students
are bored or frustrated. But solue
tlons do exist, and all Of \Is-rstue
dents, faculty, and the ndministrne
tion--niust find them ”The blueSiS
a bad thing;” something that Grine
nell should do without,
