announced candidates--Chisholln,
Lindsay, Muskie, Humphrey, Mc-
Govern, McCarthy, and Jackson. He
then asked all those who supported
any of these candidates to proceed
to separate areas ofthe gymnasium.

After this was accomplished,
Humphrey had 4 supporters, Chis-
holm 11, Muskie 21, and McGovern
104. Lindsay, McCarthy, and Jack—
son received no votes. There were
also twelve uncommitted persons.
To receive one delegate, a candle
date must receive 15% of the vote.
Since the Chisholm group did not
receive this amount, but was still
near the necessary total, Mr, San-
ders allowed the Chisholm group 10
minutes to persuade other partici-
pants to switch sides. .

During the ensuing period, the
Chisholm group did receive enough
votes to get a delegate, and other
participants changed candidates as
Well. Fran Cutler told the SlfB that
she and the ten other original meme
hers of the Chisholm group were able
to persuade people originally for
McGovern to join their group ”be—
cause we thought it would be an or
fective strategy for McGovern to
have somebody to the left..,,Ii' we
got to the county convention and saw
that Chisholm wouldn't have 15%,
then we would move over to Me»
Govern.”

Several more people entered the
caucus late and decided to partici-
pate. The final tally was: Lindsay
6, Chisholm 23, Muskie 34, and Men
Govern II5. Thus, both Chisholm
and Muskie were entitled to one
delegate, while McGovern received
the other six.

In a field of three candidates, two
of them studentsJ‘ather Tan Creti
of the St. Paul‘s Episcopal Church,
was elected to the post of the Muss ‘
kie delegate, and Al Rosenfield was
appointed alternate. The Chisholm
group needed a primary to narrow

. the wide field of potential delegates,
all students. The final victors were
Francis Cutler as delegate and Su—
salt P. Morrice as alternate,

The six McGovern delegates, cm;

sen from a wide field which included
two townspeople, were Mr Virginius
Thornton, Bob Santee, Hob VOOI't-
man, Jack ooppeli, Mary Sweeny,
and Ellen Uackmin. The alternates
were Dick Boudiu, Mary Lou Clot-
feiter, Chris Nielsen, Mary Ann
Bron, Jim Douglas, and Anne Wal—
ters.

Father Michael Tan Creti of St,
Paul’s Episcopal Church, Ward l's
Muskie delegate told the 5&8 that
he personally would like to go on to
the State convention, expeclally oe-
cause of his own concern with sev~
eral state environmental bills.

He said that he is for Muskie be,
cause he is “the winning candidate...
ne can best bent Nixon and that’s of
paramount importance in my think—
ing. One doesn't take a kind of risk
with a candidate just to prove a
cause when this is at stake.” Father
Tan Creti also said he thinks Muss
kie “can reach a very large group
of people in this society, namely
lower middle class America...he’ll
bring the best out of them.”

Elections were then held for the
Statutory Convention, Mr, Sanders
was not sure of the function Of this
group, and when the 5815 questioned
one of the Cirinnell profs as to this
group’s function, he too was hazy
about its purpose. It was described
as a committee which had outgrown
its purpose. Delegates to this com-
mittee were apportioned according
to the number of delegates won by
each presidential candidate, The
McGovern delegates and alternates
were the same as the delegates to
the county convention except that Mr,
Sanders was elected to take the place
of Jack Doppelt. The Muskie dele-
gate was Father Tan Creti and als
ternate Mrs. Dorothea Lalonde. The
Chisholm delegates were James s.
Hubbard and alternate Michael Cul-
len.

Next several voice Votes were held
to determine the support for sevv
eral local candidates, John C. Culs
ver was given support to run against
Jack Miller for the Senate seat to be
filled this year. A voice vote was
also held to determine which of the
Democratic candidates for governor

was most popular . The Scandidates
were William Gannon, lohn Taps
scotl, and Paul Franzenburg. Taps
scutt was supported strongly. Hows
ever it should be noted that most of
the students had no idea who any of
the candidates were Rather they
supported Tapscott after several
professors and students stated that
those who like McGovern wouldnlso
like Tapscott.

The caucus then Voted on Jones'
and Voertman’s suggested resolus
tions to be forwarded to the County
Convention from the First Ward of
Grinnell. They were as follows.

Be it resolved that the Platform of
the Democratic Party recommend

1. That the Congress act to bring
about the complete Withdrawal of all
U.S. forces from Indochina prior to
the 1972 Presidential Election.

2. That a minimum of $20 billion
dollars be cut from the annual appros
priations for the Department of Des
fense, and be instead appropriated
as contributory funding for expanded
programs of rural redevelopment
programs, development of new ci-
ties, and the rebuilding of central
cities.

3. That much needed tax reform be
based on the corporate and personal
income taxes, by elimination of the
oil depletion allowance, and the close
ing of other tax loopholes for the
corporate rich, not upon a regress
sive value-added tax.

4. That there be a Continued
strengthening of the constitutional
requirements for equal rights and

TWO other additions were made
First, a proposal that the legal
rights oi adult citizens be extended
to those eighteen and over was
passed Secondly, a motion wns made
that possession and use ollnajlluana
be legalized. At this point Mr San-
ders quickly dropped his rather
casual manner of running the calls
cus. All those who supported the
resolution were asked to stand and
be counted, and then the opposing
group was identified and counted.
The final vote was 34.20 support-
ing the amendment,

Sophomore Cal Emery, wllooffered
the resolution that the party come
out for the legalization of majljuana
told the SELE that he thought “because
it's important to people, a lot of
