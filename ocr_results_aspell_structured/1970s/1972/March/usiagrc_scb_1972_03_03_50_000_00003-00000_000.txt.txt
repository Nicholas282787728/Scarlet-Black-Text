Profs Are Political Aciivrsis

by Steve Nnnn

Some members of the faculty here
seem to have been born political.
Others have achieved politics, and
still others have had politics thrust
upon them. But by whatever route,
there are (now) several who con-
time what one DI their number 63115
"the long and lolty tradition” of
political activity at this place.

The chief exemplars 01 this tradi-
tion, by all odds, are Mr. Gilmour,
Mr. Jones, Mr. Plitsch, and Mr
Vanderpool. Among them, these {our
have held seats on the city council
and the School board, the County
chairmanship oi both parties, a state
senatorship, and various positions
at the precinct level,

Obviously political activity in-
terests them all. But they have (life
terent ideas DI what politics is about,
and each has his own reasons for
being involved as deeply as he is
or has been.

Gilmour clearly enjoys politics; he
has been everything lrom a precinct
committeeman to a state senator
and two—time congressional candle
date, with several inebetween posir
lions along the way.

Enjoyment aside, he thinks active
party work is the “must pragmatic"
way to iniluence society, despite
what he views as the shortcomings
oi the present political system.

Gilmour ieels that although iaculty
political involvement has been high
in “peak years“, it tends tn he shorts
term and oriented to one issue or
one candidate.

Mr. Jones, who has been Democra-
tic county chairman and also a city
councilman, says, “I certainly don't
do this because i like it.“ But
Jones seems to lake a certain pride
in his political activity nonetheless.
His work on the city council, lllcir
denially, is said to linvc improved
town—gown relations and to have done
much to dispel ttic suspicion ot the
college that exists among some Seg—
ments oi the townspeople.

Mr. Fiilsch, like Gilmourandiones
a Democrat, says he is in politics
because “I like being in a position
oi decision-making, normally called
power ' But, Ftitsch adds, he has
a “lair amount or idealism" and
liked to have a part in getting done
what he thinks should he done.

.loini Board Meeting

Plan 12 Co-Ed Dorms

by John Wylie

Housing proposals tor next year
and a plan {or a Jewish Cultural
Weekend occupied the Joint Boards
in their Wednesday Meeting in a
meeting dominated by quorum calls,
the Boards never reached the most
controversial issue on their agenda,
discussions at the Nasser and Stu-
dent Power issue.

Housing

Donna Rothenberg presented the
Housing Committees recommendav
tions tor next year to the Boards
Four single Sex dorms will remain 7
Clark and Rawson for women, Dihr
ole and Gates [or men. South campus
will be entirely men 9*including\
James Hall, which Will have experlr
mental coed bathrooms on the second
and third tloors.

Originally, Clark had been planned
as a men’s hall, but several Clark
residents appeared at the meeting
to plead for a Change. Clark resi-
dents claimed, we gaining reputa-
tlons as “animals” and “jocks”.
Changing the hall to a women’s
dorm would alleviate the problenl,
they ielt.

The remainder of the committee's
report (which is described in lull
in this week’s Magazine supplement)
was adopted without alteration. The
black Housing Committee report
was also discussed, but since it had
not yet been acted on by Social Pole
lcies and Regulation Committee, on
action could be taken.

Following the Housing Committee
report, there was a brieidiscussion

of the problem oi line Cutting at
SAGA It was tlle general consensus
of the meeting that there were no
really ellective Ways oi dealing wltll
the problem

Conilict

Members of the Associated Jewish
students than appeared to request
$400 irom GBKrR tor the JewishCul—
tural Weekend they are planning [or
the last weekend oi April. As the dISr
cussion oi the plans continued, it
deveoped that Black Martyr Weeks
end has also been scheduled for that
weekend AJS said that they had
cleared the date with Dean Wall’s
otiice two months ago and that Miss

’ Dentelihad notllled them of the alps

parent contlict only three days ago.
Changing the date would be a virtual
impossibility, they said, because al~
most all other weekends were now
also booked and because the sche-
duled speakers could undoubtedly not
he gathered together on the same
nights another time.

Phi] SaSlch went downstairs to cone
tact Lawrence Wright about the
Black weekend, but by this time it
was apparent that a quorum was no
longer in attendance, Alter liiteen
minutes olphoning, it became apparr
eat that attaining again a quorum
would be impossible,

The members present decided that
any discussion oi lhe student Power
meeting oi the previous evening
should be postponed until a later
date, 'rlieretare, a special meeting
was set ior Sunday aiternoon at 4:00,
and the meeting was adjourned.

the Democratic county chairman for
Poweshiek County, at the county con-
ventlon in Montezuma.

For several years in the sixties,
he was on the school board, where
one of his biggest victories, ”alter
a great battle" was to get a salary
increase (or town school teachers-7
to $5000.00.

Piitsch has some dissatisfactions
oi his own about iaculty participa»
tion. “You know, some oithose peer
pie have pretty good brains. And with
very little etiort on their part, they
could contribute a lot,” he said.

Mr. Vanderpool, the only Republir
can in the group, really did have
political greatness thrust upon him.
One night he skipped a party meet-
ing to attend some lunction at Grin-
nell House and later discovered he
had been elected county Chairman in
absentia.

Since then, he has continued in pol—
itics both because he likes it and
because, as he says, “one ought
to be involved with the Community,"
Like Gilmour and Pﬁtsch, he does
not think there is a tremendous
amount of political interest on the
Iaculty’s part, He indicated, hows
ever, that his perspective was oi
an outsider, a Republican among
Democrats,

Though he observed that most Grins
nell students would probahiy be
Democrats it they entered partisan
politics, he emphasized that they
would be welcome in the Republican
party as well.

The others echoed Vanderpool in
advocating local student political
activity and in being optimistic about
the etiectiveness it Could have, Gilr
mour, who though PPPE has cone
sistently advocated student politics,
indicated that he would like to see
some Students run (or ofﬁce in the
town, Pﬁtsch also saw a great pee
tential in the Student vote and said
there were several Grinneil stu-
dents who couid be politically effece
tive in the town it they were willing
to make the etion.

Jones went the furthest in his pre-
dictions about the student vote. Stu-
dents could, he said, be "an organ—
ized bloc or some power here.”
And he ioresees this happening with
in the next ten years or so. AS
“habits or participation" grow,
Jones thinks, increasing numbers oi
students will come to see that, at
least tor the tour years they are
resident here, this is where they
could have the most eitect.

Iowa legisloii

by John Morrissey

A Follow-up on previous topics in
this column:

Agreement in both houses has been
reached on all provisions oi the
”majority rights Lit [8" bill except
drinking age (see SdE, Feb. 4)
The House has stood iirm on age
18, while the Senate has maintained
its stand on a 19-yearrold drinking
age.

AS a result, the bill has been as-
signed to a conierence committee or
Senators and Representatives. The
committee has met only once to date
(Wednesday), and according to Sen.
Joseph Coleman (Fort Dodge), no
discussion has yet taken place on
points of disagreement,

A bill to appropriate iunds ior
bikeways in Iowa will probably not
be draited tor the current legisla»
live session (5&3, Feb. ll).

Rep, A. June Franklin, would—lie
sponsor of such a bill, was advised
that the allocation of state trust
funds for blkeways would be found
unconstitutional. According to res
search analyst Thane Johnson, as
signed to draft the bill, Iunds which
Rep. Franklin wanted to use can
only be used ior highway construc-
tion, and for sidewalks in towns and
cities. Consequently, Johnson has
not draitcd a bill tor appropriations,
and was awaiting further word from
Franklin as to where she will try
next ior funds.

An act to establish bikeways is

vides ioi no spaciiic appropriations.
In tact, it does little more than per.
mit the construction oi hikcpaths.
Money must come irom private
donors or tiom funds “as appropri-
ated by the c .1 Assembly” (but
the Assembly is under no obligation).
Rep Franklin has tried to give sub
stance to this act by bolstering the
above appropriations ause , by
seeking speciiic iunds ironi some

Sponsors oi the i use bill to put
