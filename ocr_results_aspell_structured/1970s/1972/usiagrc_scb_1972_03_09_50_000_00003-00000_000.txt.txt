Faculty Books In The Works

by Janet Shuldiner

Grinnell has never been considered

a “publish or perish” school but
nevertheless there is a considerable
amount of scholarly writing by the
(acuity, In an incomplete survey oi
books and articles currently being
written by Grinnell staff members
most departments were discovered
to have at least one member work-
ing onra book and all departments
have articles in the works.

Books that are presently being
written or are awaiting publishing
include such diverse topics as the
Glorious Revolution in Maryland,
the role of the FCC, Spanish
organ building, abstract algebra,
child development, radical social
theory, and the sex education con-
Iroversy.

Mr. David Jordan’s The Glorious
Revolution in Maryland awaits pubs
lication hopefully by late 1972. In
this case Study of the colonial revo-
lution in the wake of England’s Glo-
rious Revolution Jordan suggests
basic ideas on the colonial politics
and society at the end of the 17th
Century, and early 18th Century,
The colonial revolution in Maryland
is viewed as part of the evolution
of social. political and religious in-
stitutions, This unique approach der
picts the revolution as a 17th Cen-
tury phenomenon which was a lore-
runner of the American Revolution.

An annotated collection of the
Shakespearean criticism of Gran-
ville Barker by Edward Moore is
currently being considered ior pubr
lication. Barker is recognized as
one of the few critics who has made
a permanent contribution to inter
preting Shakespeare. Viewing the
works as a director DI Shakespear-
ean plays, Barker approached the
plays as stage productions to be seen
and not to be read, The collected
criticisms will combine works now
available With works Out of print

Alan Jones is currently working on
a book based on the Supreme Court
decision, Munii vs. Illinois (1877),
which will be published as a part of
a Randomhouse series on leading
constitutional decisions, Dealing
with the Midwestern Agrarian Radi-
calism and reaction to the power oi
the railroads, Jones is depicting the
decade of the 1870‘s as a whole.
This decade was marked by vio-
lence, red scares, reform and reac-
tiOn.

James Hottois and Neal Milner are

jointly compiling information for
The Sex Education Controversy: A
Study oi Politics, Education, and
Morality for the D. C. Heath series
on Politics of Education. Both are
interested in community conilict
controversy over sex education and
are testing their hypothesis about an
education problem that has not been
imposed from the outside like buss
sing. There are no other works that
academically study this problem.
Their information was based on
questionnaires filled out by 540
school districts superintendents ac,
ross the United States. Although
every district in the United States,
over 5,000 districts,'received ques-
tionnaires, only do percent respon-
ded. The first Chapter will be pub-
lished by the Midwest Political Scir
ence Association this spring.

Charles Jepsen has
three chapters oi a junior, senior
level abstract algebra book which
would be appropriate tor the junior
level here. McGraw Hill along with
several other publishers are anxious
to publish the textbook.

The contemporary responses to the
late 17th Century poem, "The Hind
and the Panther” by Dryden is the
basis of one oi Edward Foster’s pre—
sent projects. The long and obscure
poem deals with Roman Catholicism
which Dryden converted to. The re-
plies were written within iour years
alter the poem was published in
1687 and were all by Anglicans. Fos-
ter is attempting to characterize the
questions of political and religious
poetry in the 17th Century through
the use oi Dryden’s poem.

Last spring Beryl Clotielter
started writing a text for his Uni~
verse course. He taped his lectures
irom last semester and is trying to
use them as a basis for the text.
There will be more oi an emphasis
on cosmology and large Scale struc-
ture and less on the earth, moon, and
solar system, There are several
publishers interested in the hook and
he hopes to send samples to them
within a few weeks.

James Wyly is writing a book on
Spanish organ. building of the 15th-
18th Centuries. Originally the inter
mation was compiled for his disci—
tation, so Wyly will have to return
to Spain to continue research, By
studying remains and reading docur
ments of contractors Wyly has been
investigating this branch oi organolr
ogy.
