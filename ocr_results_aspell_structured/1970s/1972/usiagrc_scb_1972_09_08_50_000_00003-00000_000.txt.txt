Edna Haggins,
Problem-Solving
Resident Adviser

by Michelle Casey

”It's nice to have an older person
living in the hall situation who has
gone through the same type of ex-
periences as the students,” says
Edna Haggins, new resident adviser
for Clark and East and West Nor-
ris Halls. She feels that a res-t
ident adviser should be a person
students could come to for informal
rap sessions, to discuss problems,
and ask for advice.

Ms. Haggins has always been ins
terested in Psychology. Her life
peg ambition was to be a psychias
trist, but she decided on counseling
because of the necessity to obtain
a medical degree tor psychiatry.

A native of Indianapolis, lndiana,
Ms. Haggins attended Southern Illi-
nois University in Carbondale, llli-
nois. She obtained her BA inEnglish
literature and her MA in guidance
and educational psychology. While
she was a graduate student, she ac
quired two years experience asa
resident Counselor on an assistant—
ship basis, and took a practicum
in the clinicall center there She
is currently trying to get into a
PhD program inclinicalpsychology.

Ms. Haggins chose the resident
adviser job at Grinnell over two
other offers becausethe others were
in large university settings She
tigured she would get better experv
ience here and get to know more
people on an individual basis. A
smaller college, she feels, makes

it possible to get more involved
with the students.

"I was impressed wtth the stu-
dents when they iirst came in,”
was Ms. Haggins' tirst reaction to
Grinnell, She added, "I feel a lot
more confident now that I’ve met
the students.”

MS. Haggins feels there is adirect
relationship between her previous
work as a resident counselor and her
new position as residentadviser be
cause it is basically the same situa-
tion of living in a dorm with the
students. Disciplinary duties were
included in the resident counselor
position, however, which she didn’t
like because it tended to separate
one from the students. Her work
in the clinical center was different
as it was arranged on an appoints
ment basis a few times a‘ week

So far, she finds Grinnell much
more relaxed and not as structured.
The setup here makes it possible
to structure your own situation, she
thinks

in addition to her RA duties, Ms.
Haggins will be working at Career
Services, using experience she
gained working tor a year as a
personneil interviewer. She is also
trying to audit two Psychology cour-
ses Working with the Black Cul»
tural Center and becoming relatives
1y active in the Women's Rights
group are among her other plans.
For relaxation, Ms. Haggins likes
sports, naming swimming and tennis
as tier tavorites, and collects coins.
While a counselor should have syms
patny, Ms. Haggins teels it is more
important to have empathy. Perhaps
she summed up her teelings about
her new position best when she said
simply “I like helping people solve
problems "

SGA activities oithe pastweekhave
been limited to John Pfeffer trying
to Save himself from a lynch mob
organized by Main, Mears and
Cleveland halls, and Anne Walter
consorting with bigwigs of ISPIRG
in Des Moines. Each of these topics
is adequately covered elsewhere in
this journal, so i am relegated to
the limbo of columnist-in-search-
ot-a-topic. This problem is
compounded by the fact that I
am also the SGA reporter who has
never been to a meeting of the
current SGA.

With the above considerations in
mind I thought it might be edify-
ing to you all to embark on a brief
history of SGAva topic which Dean
Wall rightly saw fit to leave out of
his “History of Grinnell” lecture
week before last.

Tradition has it, though this is
obscured in the dim past, that once
SGA consisted of separate Council
at House presidents (all male) and
Associated Women Students (obvis
ously female) hoards. This, of
course, went along with the segrev
gatlon of campuses and other meds
ieval practices then present.

Five or six years ago the then
SGA President, Ric MacDowell, en-
gineered a reorganization into the
”council of IE”. While retaining
the A.WlS. and C. of HP. boards
the real power was transfered to a
group consisting of lo senators alar-
ted at large, the A.W.S. and C.
at HP. board presidents and the
SGA President.

This move proved to be an extreme-
ly foresighted one as the emphasis
on campus at this time turned from
more mundane campus affairs tothe
war, women’s lib., and campus
social issues such as opens and
co-ed dorms (yes, believe it or not
as few as four years ago we had
E4 hours a week of allowed co-ed
visitation which a dorm could dis-
tribute as it saw fit, with the re-
striction that no Visitation could
occur between two and six a.m.).

Behind the effective leadership of

SGA President Tom Thomas the sins
dents became an organized force on
campus and pushed many changes

ISPIRG Petition

The ISPIRG petition is only about
25 signatures short ol a majority of
the student body, ISPIRG promoter
Karen Auerbach told the S818 Weds
nesday. Te petition, which requires
a majority of student signatures in
order to make Grinnell a member
of the state ISPIRG group, should
be completed by Monday when John
tC. Neubauer, Executive Director of
lspmo, will visit the campus.

Students who have signed the pe-
tition but have not yet paid the $1.50
[SPIRG support fee should do so as
quickly as possible to Karen Auer-
batch or to Mary Jane Wynn.

The petition, once completed, will
be Xeroxed and a copy sent to the
state ISPIRG headquarters in Des
Moines, where Grinnell will be of-
ficially listed as a member of
lSPlRG. At that‘ time the support
monev will also be forwarded to Des
Moines; according to ISPIRG regus
lations $450 of the money plus 1%
of the funds collected on the campus
will then be returned to the Grinnell
lSPlRG chapter in order to fund local
ISPl'RG activities.

Auerbacn and Wynn emphasize that

through. The next year was the real
banner year for student power, While
SGA lost some importance under
the jag leadership of Jim Lew there
were many politically active stu-
dents on campus involved in the
moratoriums, student power move-
ment, the Boo strike, and finally
the closing of the school after Kent
State.

The year before last Andy Loewi
followed Jim as SGA president and
managed to permanently entrench
students in the school’s bureau-
cracyl The merits of this move are
debatable as the Council of 13 soon
died from frustration and students
again lost interest in SGA.

The Senate (of which I was a
member) sellsdestructed at the end
of that year and returned power to
the halls in a form much the same
as that of several years ago, Shels
ley Floyd’s regime last year was
remarkable only because nothing
happened all year.

Having come a run circle in struc—
ture (now the A.W.S. and C. of HP.
presidents are called SGA vice pres-
idents) it will be interesting to see
how far SGA slips out of its activ-
ist rule. The nature of the student
body has also changed radically in
the last two years, a factor which will
of course influence the role of SGA.

When and if they ever hold a meet-
ing (scheduled time and places >Wed.
night at 7:30 in ARH 11) it would
be good tor everybody to attend
at least one. They're dealing with
important issues again this year,
particularly judicial reform and
budget reform.

New Presidents

Two halls elected hall officers for
the current year at hall meetings
held last week. In Cleveland hall
Lynn Lichtenberger was elected as
President to replace Craig Kugi—
Saki, who resigned the positionear-
lier alter his appointment as'Stus
dent Coordinator. Vice-President of
Cleveland will be RameenArmajani.

In Maine hall Al Rosenfield was
elected to the VicesPresidency to
fill a vacancy for that position.

Nears Passage

the petitionvsigning process is not
over when 50% of the students have
signed. They would like to gather as
many signatures and contributions
as is possible overthe ensuing weeks

"participating colleges in other
states have had as much as 95%
of the student body join,

“After the petition is signed, it
is up to the student how much com-
mitment he wants to make," Auer—
bachvtold the 5&5 “There will be
plenty ot chances tor people to get
involved.” The local ISPIRG group
will soon begin to initiate prejects
in the local community concerned
with various aspects of the public
interest.

ISPIRG supporters addressed the
Resident Advisers on the subject
at a meeting last night, and plan to
try to get the taculty involved by
circulating a petition which, although
it could not be counted for member»
ship purposes as can the studentpe»
tition, would demonstrate faculty
support for the idea Eventually
ISPIRG supporters anticipate that
the town of Grinnell could become
involved as well.
