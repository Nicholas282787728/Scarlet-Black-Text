Florence Offers ManyTopics

Amidst all the rumors lhatBurling
Library is slowly being interred into
the earth at the rate of 1/2 inch a
year, I have discovered a viable alr
ternalive, Not that there is any
inkling of truth to these calumnles,
but the nickname Burllng the Titanic
can be a bit scary.

The allernative is a small rectangr
ular room stuck between Mears Hall
and the passageway to Main Lounge.
It is called The Florence Lewis
Library...by no one.

No one who studies there knows its
name,

Most of the 343 books (by last count
"David Gaines, Feb. 9, 1972) have
”Lewis Library” inscribed in them.
Someone went to painstaking effort
to imbed MS, Lewis Into our un-
grateful hearts, And for naught? No,
I sing oi her generosity.

The room itself is filled with
warmth that is inversely proportions
al to that of most libraries. The
warmth isn’t due to the fireplace
which has been sealed up. But the
room with its Early American revo-
lution iurniture tends to grow on you.

On a corner wall hangs a list ofthe
Grinnell Women in War Service.
This is significant to the themes of
many of the books in the room.
Mears had not long ago been the
stronghold of the conﬂuence of the
prim South Campus women. Many
still claim it is. I beg to differ I
live there,

But not so long ago. women ot
iervent Christian upbringings barri-
caded themselves in Means. They
must never have been at a loss for
topical reading material.

The library has a multitude of res
ligious works, such as “At Play in
the Fields of the Lord,” “Torches
Through the Bush," a collection of
"The Student Hymnary," and ”At
Worship,” There are also many

Chaplain Solves
Serious Impasse

To the Editors:

I have received a copy oi a letter
given to the son on January 20 ior
publication, a letter concerning the
existence and needs of homosexuals
on campus. The son has not pub-
lished this letter because it is not
signed. The writer of the letter
apologizes ior not signing the letter,
but doesn’t trust the reaction of
straight fellow Grinnellians.

Because of the importance Of the
letter, 1 suggest the iollowing solu-
tion to this impasse: that the writer
of the letter speak to me personally
(with the understanding of complete
confidentiality) to determine if the
letter is serious (I believe it is);
that on my recommendation, without
any name given, the letter be pub-
lished in the next 5&3 (the editors
are agreeable to this procedure) in
order that the questions and issues
regarding homosexuality on campus
may be discussed iurtner in an open
forum.

To the Editors:

In view of one of your latest issues
in which the ’liberalcamp’ had much
opportunity to redundantly exchew
their cud. I feel an obligation to
raise the banner of rationality and
perhaps to allow the clear. bright
rays of truth to shine through the
oftenrtimes impenetrable miasma of
wishyrwashy American political
thinking.

Much talk of late has been devoted
to the relative merits of the motley
assortment of disestablishmentar-
ian candidates, i.e. those who could
be united under the label of ‘anti-
Nixonites'. Although Such talk is
a Valid antiscorbutic for the selfr
induced soporiferousness of that
Widespread ailment “Forum
Bore’m”, and also a line way to
stimulate (or vitiate) "meaningful
interpersonal relationships", it is

books oriented toward women. “W07
manpower" and "The Husband”
would induce any woman in search
of her identity to browse.

But Florence Lewis offers much
more than two topics. A 1954 edis
tion of The Encyclopedia Britannica
oiiers aid in contemporary courses.
It is the type of reference book that
has George Washington listed I732-

). Vietnam wasn't even called
Indochina then The volumes are
dedicated to President Eisenhower
and Queen Elizabeth the Second
They emit about as much informar
tion as a mute Doberman Pincher.

The room contains a low eye catch-
ers such as “A Bell for Adano“ by
John l-lersey, “The Song oi Bernar
dette” by Franz Werfel and “Modern
Biology" by Moon, Mann and otto,
which I treasure because I used it
in high school.

It also contains some puzzlers:
“Some of my Best Friends are
Soldiers" printed in 1944, “The
Inner Life of Abraham Lincoln,”
printed in 1883, and "The Modern
Use of the Bible,” printed in 1924,
which is about the time The Bible
was conceived.

You may not feel Florence Lewis
is any alternative to Burling, but
it’s not sterile, competitive, and no
one will tell you to keep quiet...
except me. I live next door.

To all those people I mislead, Nellie-
belle was Roy Rogers’ jeep and Dale
Evans' horse was Buttermilk. For-
give me! To all those people who
came to me and so vehemently indi-
cated that to me; try this; Who
drove Nelliebelle? Who played Bret
(not Bari) Maverick and on what
other show did he star? I’ll show
you trivial experts. (TURN TO THE

those piercing truths which pop the

convictions.

We mustbeginwiththepremisethat
all recent presidential administrar
tions have been basically inter—
changeable in their accomplishr
ments and failures. In the domestic
and foreign spheres these presidents
have all adhered to the same basic
principles: the “American Mission”
to the world, support‘oi business, a
system of bureaucratically impeded
social progress. Harry the True was
as hawkishly powerrminded as any
in his decision to drop the bomb,
President Eisenhower; the Republi-
can darling, did, however, Counsel

president Kennedy, God’s gift to
Peter, Paul, and Mary, was respon-

Boosts Washington Semester

by Terry Wolf

For those of you who might like
to step out irom Saga. the Longhorn,
and the Pizza Hut, I'd like to recom-
mend lhe Astor Restaurant, which
features cheap but good Greek food
and an occasional belly dancer. No,
the Astor is not on the outskirts of
town, or even in Des Moines; it’s
located at 20th and M in the heart
oi Georgetown.

li you're not fed up with the iood,
maybe you’d like a different kind of
class. How about a fourrcredit ins
ternship in the office ofa Senator,
Congressman, or Ambassador?

These are just some oi the oppor-
tunities which are afforded the Grins
nellian who lakes part in the Wash-
ington Semester, an oii campus
program from which Curt Gorrell
and I just returned. If this sounds
like a sales pitch, blame that on the
fact that Curl and I (and all other
Grinnellians we‘ve talked to who’ve
been on the program) have iound the
Washington Semester to be a thor-
oughly enjoyable and educational ex-
perience (a rare combination these
days); and in any case one which
merits more attention than is given
it by the three line description inthe
catalog.

The Washington Semester is actur
ally not one program, but three.
The regular government semester is
the largest program, divided into
three units of approximately 25-30
students each, The urban semester
and international semester are the
other two programs, newer and
somewhat smaller and with some»
what different structure, but just as
good. All oi the programs are divi-
ded as follows:

1) a double seminar session worth
eight credits. These sessions entail
meeting anywhere from three to five
times a week with officials from var
ious government agencies or repre-
sentatives from the press or lobby
groups -- in thepast, these sessions
have featured Senators John Ken»
nedy, Hubert Humphrey, Barry
Goldwater, Congressman Wilbur
Mills, ex-Ambassador Averell Hare
riman, and Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas. Sessions like
these are generally better for ego»
boosting and writing impressive let-
lers home As a rule, the more in,
formative seminars are with not so
glamorous figures.

2) A research project worth iour

credits. This project, which in the
end contains the real blood, sweat
and tears, is one which takes you both
to the Library oi Congress and to
government officials, not all of whom
are crying to give outinformation to
overzealous students. If the project
deals with questions oi foreign polr
icy W in which case one must deal
with the Executive Branch or be
forewarned that while this is not an
insurmountable task, it is not unlike
trying to squeeze blood from a tur-
nip, a final hint on the research pro—
)ect: those who seek out not an ob—
score, but a relatively unstudied
topic have a greater likelihood ofob~
taming information from officials
and of producing an original paper
than do those who pick out more
current, “hot" issues.

3) The final four credits of this 16
credit semester are earned by take
ing either a course offered by Amer
ican University or an internship like
I mentioned above. Curt and I. both
Grinnell snobs, feel that a course
from AU would be on something less
than a par with a course from Grin-
nell and that an internship is a far
better way to make use oithe oppor
tunity of being in Washington. Curt
worked for Congressman Fete Mc-
Closkey (R.-Cal,) and Iworked for
Senator Stuan Symington (D.~Mo.).

Committee hearings, White House
press conferences, State Depart
ment briefings, and embassy parties
also provided opportunities to study
the political process and meet people
involved in that process.

As we understand it, next semester
the international program is going to
be restructured to include "task
forces.” These five or sinman
teams will work in conjunction with
Congressional staffs to research and
develop positions on current foreign
affairs situations, A few other slur
dents and myself became involved in
this type of activity informally,
working with the staffs of Congress
men Diggs (D.-Mich.) and Fraser (D.
Minn.) in an attempt to remove the
Byrd amendment from the military
procurement bill.

As in any other semester, as much
ii not more learning took place out
side the scope of the academic pros
gram. Both Curt and I found that
living in Washington was in itself
half the experience. Unlike Grinnell,
where parking is iairly ample, where

it takes ten minutes to get from one
end of town to another, and where
KGRN broadcasts ”no dispositions
in J. Edd Lincoln's court...and a
quiet night overnight in Grinnell”,
the 5—mile drive from All to the Hill
takes an hour in rush hour. When
you get there there isn’t any park-
ing and it you get out oi your car,
the chances of being mugged or raped
or both is an even 5050. So maybe
it’s a hassle to live in the city, but
if it's a hassle, it’s still exciting
The drinking age is ill and there are
more places to go in Washington than
you’ll ever be able to get to.

I can't complete a description of
the Washington Semester without
mentioning our home base, The
American University, Compared to
Grinnell, our dorm rooms were rel-
atively modern and sterile, and the
people cold. It’s not even a nice
place to visit ,_ and pretentious?
Anyplace called THE American Uni»
versity has to be Fortunately, most
ot our contact at ho was with people
in the Washington Semester. Mast
had come from small colleges in
states that start with vowels, and
unlike Grinnell, broad geographical
distribution insured a fairly heter-
ogeneous group of political opinion.
For once, our traditional Grinnell
liberalism was Challenged in an aca-
demic situation by equally informed
persons with different viewpoints.
This new perspective proved stimur
iating.

For those who might be considering
the International Semester, Curt and
I both recommend International Polr
itics as a good background course.
The stated prerequisites are a jun-
ior standing and some background
in the field of political science.
(However, seniors are accepted, and
one need not be a political science
major.) Although Grinnell has a
quota of two students for the fall
semester, there have been openings
in the past which allowed some Grin-
nell Students to attend the spring
semester and more than two to go in
the fall. For further information
about the program, see Mr. Alan
Jones or contact anyone oius who've
been in the program for more in-

nate.

The “liberal” Democratic party
then gave us Lyndon Johnson who
warmed the hearths of those that
live in Goldwater flats with his air-
mailed missives to Hanoi and his
Dominican picnic,

President Nixon is no Albert
Schweitzer but he is pulling troops
out of Vietnam at a steady rate.
For all intents and purposesapress
ident's party affiliation or his own
personal political idiosyncracies
are subjects of neither interest nor
consequence. It is easy to c. wright
through the forests ofthe New Frons
tier Cll" the gilded towers ofthe Great
Society and find the mills of Pitts—
burgh puiiing away unconcerned. The
ineluctnble forces of history have
powers far beyond those of mortal
men.

We must seek criteria other than
“ideological progressiveness" for
judging the relative merits presi—
dents, past, present and potential.
political science, i.e. cynical his
tory, tells us that next to that which
actually happened the most im-
portant thing in the political Wel-
tanschauung is that which people
believe happened. If people believe
things are going well, or if they can
see the immediate possibility of
things going well they will be happy.
Since that which is actually happen-
ing is either impossible to deter-
mine, totally beyond the liliputian
grasp of our own eiiorts, or justthe
same old bullshit we’ve been getting
for the past twentyrfive years; and
since it Is a political, psychological,
and spiritual truth that it is ulti-
mately much nicer to be happy than
sad, Descartian algebra leads us to
the conclusion that the best presi-
dent is the one whose administration
creates the greatest happiness for
the greatest number ofpeople. Jerer
my Bentham redefined and trium-

phant in contemporary terms.
President Nixon’s administration
has been marked by a succession of
political moves oi such unprece-
dented unpredictability, that lne "3,
tion has been infused with a practi»
cally hallucigenic euphoris that
comes from a feeling that damn near
anything could happen and that the
various possibilities are just as
likely to be wonderful as not. This
is a far cry from the dismally de—
pressive pessimism that pervaded
the nation and perverted mentation
during the previous administration.
Undoubtedly there are those mis-
guided souls and unsuspecting utor
pographers who will protest: ”Our
country would still be in the mercir
less grip of the robber barons if it
wasn’t ior the struggles of cru-
sading, progressive leadersl”
There are two replies to this form
of insipidlty: I) If you imagine the
country is not still controlled by
Standard Oil and the likes then you
probably haven’t read much since
you left Bth grade; and 2) if you
still look for liberal, progressive
acts and attitudes as a criterion for
presidents I would simply point out
that President Nixon has recently
uncorked the two most progressive

acts oi the past twenty-five years"
the raprochement with Red China
and the wagerprice Controls,

Why trade staccato bursts of eu-
phoria interspersed by periods of
laughable incredulity for a boring
four years of well-intentional frus-
tration and sincere schlepism’? Let
us realize once and for all that the
only man suited ior the Presidency
at this time is Mr, Nixon.

Having reduced my arguments to
the simplest possible terms and at
comcomitantly having reduced any
potential critics to a position some-
where around the lower reaches of
abject hopelessness, I now have only
one wish; that I have succeeded in
some small way in planting iresh,
potent seeds in the much too barren
iields or current political thought.
Some will say that l have merely
been playing the devil’s advocate in
the midst of a morass of mono-
minded morons; but no, Ido notpres
fer to tease hell yet. For although
this may be a “wasteland” indeed,
in words one may still discover
rich, greening American pastures
of intelligent commentary and as-
sorted beansprouts.
