Bender Criticizeslegisluiors ‘

by Steve Nunii

Rich Bender, Assistant to the
Chairman of the state Democratic
party, spoke last Tuesday to a mod-
erate-sized crowd in the South
Lounge concerning reapportionment
in Iowa. Bender's talk, sponsored
by the Program in Practical Politi—
cal Education, Compared the process
of Iowa’s reapportionmeni process
to putting together a jigsaw puzzle
where all kinds of pressures, some
of them conflicting, inﬂuence the
shapes of the pieces.

He blamed public indifference for
the inequities which have forced
court»authored reapportioument
plans like the one recently devised
for lowa. Surveys have shown, Ben—

'der Said, that “there is no topic the
public is less interested in than res
apportionment. But there is nothing
the legislature cares about more,"

The problem is that legislators’
goals in reapportionrnent are not 31»
ways those oi the law. For example,
Bender noted that individual legiSr
letters are concerned about the party

makeup of their own districts, about 1’ .

the potential for opposition in elec»
lions, and even about thegeographic
size of their districts: they don't
like to travel too much, Frequently
legislators will wheel and deal with

When you know

it’s for keeps

one another to work out these ques:
tions while the requirements of the‘

law and public interest get relegated
to lower priority.

The Iowa legislature, under court
order, has made six dilterent at-
tempts to reapportion itselt, allot
which have been tounu unconstitu-
tional, because they have exceeded
the tolerance allowed undcr the one
man—one vote decisions at recent
years,

The legislature was taken to task
before the state supreme Court, in
the most recent case, by a coalition
that included the AFL—CIO, the Leae
gue oi Women Voters, the lowa
Civil Liberties Union, and the Demo
cratic party Apparently persuaded
of the legislature’s incompetence,
the court drew up a plan of its own
for reapportionment.

This plan, which will be in effect
for the election this year, must be
reviewed in ten years if not chal»
lenged sooner, and similar reviews
must be undertaken at ten year in-
tervals for all succeeding plans.

The reviews, however, will still
be the prerogative oi the legisla~
lure, unless it is challenged in
court; and Bender was not optimis-
tic about the possibilities for any
more strict attention to letter of
the law in the future
”When a legislator’s chances tor
reeeiection conflict with the law’s
requirements," he said, "the law
is going to lose."

i speak of bold men in a place we

Rodents, and the Pit was their lot.
They looked at their world, and they
round it lacking; trapped below earth
without color or warmth. But out of
the bloom an idea was born, a rose

Clark Pit Goes Aesthetic

A community was formed, and in

laughter they shared a sense of
creation.

A camel appeared where the plas-
ter was peeling; footprints and tree
limbs arched over the ceiling. Paints
- blue, black, green, yellow, red,
orange and on , now covered dull
blege in a variety of forms, Yet
though the idea was fine. and the
party was fun, as with many good
things it was carried too far.

Though the people were many, the
artists were few, and no one had
imagined what free paint in the hands
or academically pressured Grinnel-
lians would do, The next day, when
their minds cleared, the Rodents
looked out - and found for their

A proposal to set up sate bikepaths
is going smoothly, according to
Brian Davidson, statewide organizer
of “Cyclists for Bikepaths in lowa”
(CEI).

The proposal, if adopted by the Iowa
legislature, would appropriate a de
signaled amount from state highway
funds specilically tor the construc-
tion and maintenance of bikepaths.

Currently the CBI is collecting
written support from schools and
campuses throughout the state.
Grinnell students have posted pc-
titions on bulletin boards on campus

“We hope to get 2,300 signatures
by February 19th to send to the
legislature,” said Carol Patterson,
senior and campus organizer for the
CHI.

-The petition reads:

“l, the undersigned, feel that there
is an immediate need for state built
bikepaths in lowa. I would like to
see:

(i) One percent of all' highway funds _

to be used for building blkepaths, or;
(2) A comparable amount to be alloe
cated, without delay.

I expect my representatives in all
government positions to work for
this, and will use my vote accord-
ingly."

Davidson, 3 student from Des
Moines, is skeptical about obtaining
1% of all highway funds tor bike
paths The bike~supporlers have re-
adjusted their goal to $90,000, ac-
cording to Davidson.

A iederal highway revenue—sharing
program has allocated funds for
bikepaths but only upon request of
the state highway commission. The
commission has yet to act on the pro-
posal.

The purpose of the statewide effort,
according to Davidson, is to reduce
pollution hazards while promoting
sate bicycle recreation.

“Most people don't go out on hikes
because it's unsafe, and those who
do, take their lives into their own
hands,” cited Davidsoni

Those interested may write to
Representative A. June Franklin
(Dem., Des Moines), sponsor of the
proposal in the lowa House; Claire
strand, House representative from
Grinnell; or Contact Carol Patterson
at 6-6042.

So, as the Chinese bike manufactur-
er, Thieu Whee-ler says, “Lide on.”

quarters a zap Comic Book. "My
God”, cried the Rodents, “What
will we diff”; for the people were
many, and the artists were low, but
even artists were hard to find when
it came time to clean up the mess.

But the Leader of Clark provided
the rationale: ”A halfeassed job’s
better than no job at all." So
sparked by desire, determination,
and fear (for BELG wasn’t likely to
take kindly to this), they scrubbed
and mopped and sponged and swabe
bed and wiped and cursed and la
bored until their lair was once
again reduced to its natural ster»
ility, Almost.

For there were those who’d had
foresight, who saved some of the art,
and here and there paintings yet
brightened the walls. And today as
you read some or the best still re-
main, and Clark pit now shines, an
enlightened domain. (aesthetically,
at least).

Faculty Nixes
Evaluation Plan

The Magee proposal for laculty
evaluation by the faculty was voted
down in the first stage of debate at
last Monday’s taculty meeting.

The faculty seemed to be concerned
during the debate with increasing
contact in a professional or semi-
protessional sense, but they were
unwilling to embark on the strum
lured, time—consuming Magee pro-
posal.

The faculty also passed a re-
commendation to the President and
Board of Trustees that a department
of Religious Studies be established.
The Executive Council had twice
denied the request to establish such
a department. A major in Religious
Studies will not be considered until
a specific major program has been
defined and gone through the EPC’s.

The Executive Council's original
denial was based on two points.
They were unclear as to what “re-
ligicus studies” means and thus
questioned its validity as a major
discipline.

Religious Studies has existed at
Grinnell in tact but not in name,
thus the establishment Of the depart
ment, some faculty pointed out,
would pose no immediate financial
burden while providing the admini- '
stratlve advantages of separating
Religious studies from philosophy.
