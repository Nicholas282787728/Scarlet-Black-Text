Students Canvass For McGovern

hy David Nicolai

Approximately thii'tyGrinnell stu—
dents invaded Lincoln, Nebraska,
last weekend in order to help as-
sure a victory tor Senator George
McGovern (Deiii., South Dakota) in
the presidential primary held Tilesr
day. During the two days spent in
Lincoln we received It real intro-
duction to the “nittrgritty” work
ot politics.

The chartered bus left Grinnell
around 5'00 Friday atternoon and
arrived at Lincoln at 9:15. Despite
the long bus trip we managed to get
a couple of hours work uccomptisih
ed at McGovern headquarters that
night. An equal number at students
lroin Kansas University arrived a
low minutes after we did. (It was
interesting to note the very small
number of volunteers front the Uni-
versity ol Nebraska, which is lo-
cated only about six blocks lrom
McGovern headquarters

The guys were scattered among dit—
iereiit apartments and homes, and
many iound themselves sleeping on
the floor. But the Gi'innell girls
were more fortunate; they slept in
a rather luxurious sorority house
at the university. ‘ut' the rest oI
the weekend they were comparing
notes about what they had learned in
their hi‘iei introduction to the
wonders of Sorority life.

Saturday was to be the day tor loot
canvassing, a process in which every
registered Democrat in Lincoln was
visited by u McGovern volunteer who
attempted to elicit his opinion about
the motor issues and about
McGovern‘s candicacy. The weather
could not have been more uncoopr
erative; not only did raililall slende
ily throughout the tiny, but also the
temperature managed toliuvei' inttie
high 40’s and low 505, We all res

turned from oilr two to tour hours
ol loot canvassing completely
drenched,

The work did not end here. We
wrote personal letters to various
people to whom we had talked during
the canvass and looked up telephone
numbers and phoned in a canvass of
people not found at home or still un-
decided about the primary; tiled
cards for every McGovern supe
porter, and more.

The culinary delights supplied for
its by the Lincoln McGovern people
were something else. Greasy dough-
nuts, grensicr potiito chips, iiplogiia
sandwiches, and sloppy yoes were
the standard {arc for the weekend.

Doing this "dirty" work or polle
tics was evidently a rude awakening
[or some or the naive students.
Distress was expressed by a low
students over the fact thiit we were
“iorging” the sigiiatui s of promi-
nent Lincoln Denioc is on post-
cards. Alsu, some disillusionment
was expressed when Senator
McGovern was toi-ced basically to
back down somewhat on his prev-
iously voiced stands on legalized
abortions, ltll iliiiiii, :Iiiil amnesty
for (it'nit (lodgers litter the itppt. [-

Although there wui' times when
McGovern headquarters appeared
o totally disorganized mess, the
local organization actually |iir sur-
passed that oi any other (tnildiilat

luce: Viet Nam Worse

Don Luce, :i Iiorticultili‘alist af~
itlttitell with the World Council of
Churches, gave two lectures here
last weekend. Mr Luce spent
12 years in Vietnam--irunl 1958 nne
til 1971, and he Sliys that lifter all
he has seen he Ieels obliged to tell
the American public the truth about
the Saigon gavel nment.

During the last is years a million
Vietnamese children have been Ore
ptianed and crowded into special
villages, villages where education is
nun-existent and medical supplies
scanty. Many civilians who have
been spared troni mutilation keep
busy tiy manutacturing nrtilicial
linibs, but. there lire virtually no
resources tor dealing with the psv-
chological problems that result
iroiii the loss or an arm, a leg. ci-
a linger.

Mines, bombs, and booby traps are
more of a threat to the civilian
population than to the soldiers, Luce
reported; and he cited a survey by
a Quaker organization that showed
37% ct civilian inpiries are intlict—
ed by Americans,

Detrllilition has rendered 200,000

acres at larmlund useless or years
to come, and important crops like
sugarcane aiid ttic sap irom rubber
trees must oiien be destroyed tor
security reasons. Once the world’s
second largest exporter of rice,
South Vietnam is now an importer.
Luce said that the cost of living
rdse some [lily pei'centbetween 1969
and 1071.

American economic aid to Vietnam
is alien ridiculous, says Luce, We
have provided a television station,
which they did not ask tor and will
not be able to afford when we leave.
We have supplied X-ray equipment
where there is no electricity, and
good roads for our tanks, said Luce.
We have supplied food to bombed
villages, and replaced destroyed
houses with wooden ones.

Ttie iilin was made three years
ago' according to Mr. Luce, things
have gotten even worse since then.
New weapons and increased bomb-
ing are creating scars iroin which
the Vietnamese may never recover.

Grinnell's iinancial managers don’t
look like oil tycoons, but according
to Anderson, there is an active oil
well among the College's properties,
although it accounts lor only a very
small proportion of tiie total land
holdings. He also noted that there
are potential oil holdings in Kansas
which have not been developed.

These arms are leased to private
individuals, who actually run the
land, The thrill operations are under
the supervision of Mr. Lainhie.
College iai-in holdings are gratlih
ally decreasing, since the nne
dowment Fund no longer makes larm
investments. The farms whichthe
College nowowus were gilts to the

The College also owns a number at
houses in Grinnell, which are rented
to faculty members. The hnuses
came to the college as gills through
the year, and the rental income now
goes into the endowment income,

Griniiell also owns 8 terms th-
roughout Iowa. About 2200 acres oi
land have been left to the college,
and these farms now have a total
book value of about $600,000.

in recent years, a number or these
houses have been Converted into on
campus student residences. Since
the Endowment Fund must receive
rental income from each of its in»
vostments, the Current Opere
ating rund oi the College pays the
Endowment Fund “rent” for the
houses Mr. Anderson didn't mention
whether students would be evicted
it the College was late in paying
the rent to itself

College income from these rental
properties will decrease sharply in
1975 because, under Iowa law, the
School will then become liable {or
property taxes on all rental prop-
erty it owns.

Through its endowment fund, Grin-
nell College weiii's many hats. Its
investments range from farmland to
oil wells to store buildings, and the
fund's iiicunie provides $725,000 for
scholarships, Professor's Chairs,
and current operating expenses.
