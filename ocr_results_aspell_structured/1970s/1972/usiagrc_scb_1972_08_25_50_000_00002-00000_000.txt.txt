Fuller Delivers Commencement Address

Four Baccalaureate speeches and a
Commencement address by R Euckr
minster Fuller last May 24 brought
a Grinnell career to a close for the
Class of 1872.

Baccalaureate, which was moved to
Darby gym Irom its scheduled out
side presentation, because threaten-
ing rainclouds made good their
threats, teatured serious and
humorous and serious addresses by
seniors Janet Smith, Ed Hirsch, R
Marshall Barber, and faculty mem-
ber Pete Smith.

Janet questioned whether the litter
alizatioii in the Grinnell structure
over the past four years have ace
tually represented true progress tor
Grinnell students, After sumarlzing
the major changes in housing, acar
demic requirements, and school
regulations, she asserted that many
at these had been poorly thought out
and damaging to the school.

She concluded, ". .the most
important word in ‘liberalrarts tra-
dition’ is tradition: literally, ahand-
ing over or giving across, inherent
in this is a respect for the achieve—
ments of the past. We should grate~
tully accept this heritage, make our
contribution, and further its Continr
uance.”

Pete Smith's speech compared the
College to a hologram-a three die
mensional photograph. Both the Cole
Iege and a hologram are imperfect
unless all parts are interacting in
perfect harmony. Members of the
class of '72, Smith said, had helped
focus the energies of the students
into meaningful and coherent input
into the administrative process, thus
improving the hologram,

Ed Hirsch addressed the teelings
ot' apprehension which accompany
college graduation. He asserted that

John J. Okumu, a Grinnell graduate
of the class of 1962, will be Heath

ence and Scholar-imllesidence at

ett told the 3&8 Wednesday. His
wife Laura will serve as a lectur-
er in comparative education in the
Department of Education.

0kumu, a native Kenyan, received
in 1966 his Ph.D. degree Irom the
University of Calitornia (Les Anr

sities, indluding schools in Tan-

years Dkumu was the head of his

the liberal arts education is still
valid, and that society will have to
adjust to accept the skills or the
newly educated young. H .soclety
won’t be much better or worse than
the people themselves. It the people
change, then sooner or later the
society must change.”

Marshall Barber concluded the
program with a speech he called
Notes from under the Table. ATem-
perate View. He used his KDIc
radio program as an example of“my
quarrel , , .with those people who
take themselves so seriously that
they are intolerant of those who
don't,"

He noted that, during the two peak
periods 01‘ anti-war activity in the
Spring, KDIC had become a virtual
communications arm of the antirwar
movement, ignoring the desires of
what he estimated as half the
campus

“In conclusion, I question the teas
Ibility of a college using its limited
facilities {or too many grandiose and
rococu schemes to save the world.”

The following morning the clouds
cleared and the sun shone bright for
the Commencement exercises,
which were held on the central cam-
pus grass behind Herrick Chapel.
Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the
geodessic dome and a noted scien»
tist, inventor, and humanist, dee
livered the main address of the day
prior to receiving an honorary Doc-
torate of Letters from President
Leggett.

Fuller’s address presented an op-
timistic View of the future for the
class at '72. While acknowledging
the problems of pollution and over—
population, he asserted that they
could be solved with present day

Nairobi in Kenya, and has served
in recent years as the Dean of Arts
and Sciences at the University.

Several Grinnell students have str

at the Colorado College Summer
Session where he has been a meme
ber of the summer faculty.

The Heath professorships are paid
for by an endowment which provides
for the appointment of an alien as
visiting professor at the college.
The most recent Heath professor
was Englishman Jeremy Montagu,
who served as Heath Professor of
Music for the first semester of the

In The Public Interest
Student Group Seeks Support

The lowa Student Public Interest
Research Group is alive and well,
and it its supporters on the Grinnell
campus have much to say about it,
Grinnell will soon be participating
in its publiceinterestmriented ac-
tivities.

ISPIRG (pronouncedlike ”ices
berg") is only one of several simi-
lar state organizations created
around the country during the past
two years which plan to operate as
an organized public interest insti»
tution under the direction ofstudehts
from state colleges and universi»
ties The idea, originated by workers
in the Ralph Nader organization in
Washington, D C .has been growing
on college campuses across the
country since 1970,

Minnesota and Oregon colleges bee
gan the process or torming their
ISPIRGS in the tail of 1970 and since
then numerous states have either
formed the organizations or are
presently in the process otdoing so.
The idea is that college students
from every institution in the state
contribute $1 t0$ 3(depending on the
state) per year to a central public
interest organization, run by student
representatives from the particir
pating colleges, which will then use
the money to hire' professional
people to direct the public interest

. campaigns undertaken and to give

assistance to students undertaking
projects at their own. A Director
will be selected, it battery of laws
yers and science researchers hired,
and administration procedures tier
Vised.

The organization oversees state—
wide ISPIRG Campaigns and gives
assistance to public interest organi-
zations at the College level cone
ducting their own locallyroriented
projects. In some states the col~
leges participating in the organiza—
tion devise courses which relate to
ongoing projects and sponsor stu-
dent independent research projects
which will be used in the process
or investigating possible areas of
interest.

Don Ross or the Washington-based
Nader organization is the national
coordinator for the State Public In-
terest Research Groups, and recoms
mends national projects as well.
The idea, according to Grinnell
Student Government Association
Vice»President Anne' Walter, is to
create ”an organized public inter»
est body to oppose institutions which
do not operate in the public inter-
est, such as businesses, big agricul»
ture, and some government
agencies,” Power is institution-
alized in favor of the non—public
interestroriented groups of the
society, according to the ISPIRG
view, and the creation of such

a Public Interest organization is an
attempt to balance the situation.
The State Board of the Iowa Slur

has suggested a number of possible
projects. Hearings will be held this
tall at various participating colleges .
concerning agricultural problems,
problems of discrimination in Iowa
employment as reported by the Iowa
Civil Rights Commission; the
alleged non-regulation otsupposedly
”regulated industries, the Iowa
pollution problem, particularly colt»
cermng the Mississippi River, and
various consumer and healthy

oriented problems,
Other projects have potential as

well. Proposed studies include an

examination at advertising in Iowa
communities, a study or credit pol-
icies by Iowa businesses, a look

into property tax assessment pracA
lices to check for preferential treat
ment or conflicts of interest, an eXr
amination of the effectiveness of
government services ottered to the
small Iowa tarmer, and many other
projects as well.

ISPIRG has already begun to Send
out newsletters to Iowa congressmen
to inform them of the group’s ac
tivities and has received favorable
publicity in the Iowa press,

The Iowa organization was created
last year when at tourteen Iowa
colleges a majority or the students
signed petitions supporting the lor—
mation of ISPIRG and the particl-
patiou at their college in the or»
garlization. Fee collections at those
colleges have begun this fall. As
an indication ot the enthusiasmns y,
of the 1600 students at Iowa state
University have agreed to pay the
ISPIRG tee.

Representatives from the fourteen
colleges and several other in,
terested institutions, including
Grinnell, have participated this
summer in the process of select-
ing an Iowa director and other mem-
bers of the state statt. John C .
Netibauer, twentyrfourryearrold
graduate of Drake University exper-
ienced in consumer-oriented ser-
vice organizations was chosen as
State ISPIRG Director. Other staff
were chosen as well, Including Todd
Friedlander, a Grinnell graduate
from the class M1969, who will con-
centrate On directing the research
aspects of the organization.

Grinnell’s status in ISPIRG right
now is as an interested outsider.
Although several students became
interested in the organization last
year, a petition was uevercirculated
to the student body because oI con-
Ilicts with antiwar demonstrations
and other campus concerns last
semester. Nonetheless campus
ISPIRG enthusiasts plan to circulate
the petition during the first weeks
of this Semester and will begin col»
lecting money trom interested stu-
dents who wish to support the or-
ganization. Mary Jane Wynn and
Karen Auerbach, who instituted the
Grinnell drive last spring, have ex-
pressed an interest in representing
Grinnell on the statewide board.
SGA VicerPresident Anne Walter
will be attending a statewide ISPIRG
meeting on Sept. 2.

ISPIRG enthusiasts will begin the
petition signing drive by having a
table at Registration next Tuesday.
All students interested in seeing
Grinnell become active in the or-
ganization are urged to sign either
at Registration or during the early
weeks of the semester
