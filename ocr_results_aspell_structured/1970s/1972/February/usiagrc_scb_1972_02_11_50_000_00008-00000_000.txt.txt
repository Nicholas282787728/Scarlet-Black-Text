the Cornell two-mile relay team,
four runners sprinting a half-mile
apiece. Chuck also came back five
minutes later to help the Grinnell
two mile relay team to a victory.
Dan Hildebrand, heir apparent to
McGrath's distance running throne,
had a fine day, winning the mile,
taking a second in the two mile, and
helping out on the twoemile relay.
Afterwards he commented, “ll was

Burnett Tries For l,000

by Curt Gurrell

Victory. That word, standing alone
as the opening sentence, sums up in
itself the important message of this
week’s basketball article, Grin-
nell’s Brball team, which trekked
last Friday to frozen, arctic Apples
ton, Wis., established there a 56»59
victory over their rivals from Law-
rence.

The cage rs were not only ellective-
ly able to contain Warden of Laws
rence, who entered the game as the
third leading conference scorer with
a 190 point per game average (and
who left with five fonts and only l2
points), but they also registered a
potent offensive punch in the person
of Bob Burnett, who celebrated his
return to action with 30 points . The
victory constituted the second in
conference play, and the third over
all for Grinnell this season.

Uniortunately, moving westward to
Ripon the next day, the Pioneers met
With much stiffer opposition. Al-
though convincingly beaten atRlpon,
where our traveling troupe booked a
19 point deficit to go down to a
92-73 defeat, for those of an optir

mistic demeanor who search for
silver linings, it is encouraging to
note that, after Ripon jumped to an
early 16 point lead in the lirst half,
the two teams played and scored on
a reasonably even level tor the re-
mainder of the day.

Burnett again led the scoring at—
tack for the good guys with lSpoints.
He was aided by senior Greg Bom-
binski and sophomore Dennis Moss
who also climbed to double figures,
scoring 23 points combined.

This weekend the Pioneers, fins
ally scheduled to once again enters
tain locally, will host matches with,
of all institutions, Lawrence and
Ripon. Tonight the hoopsters will
seek a repeat performance over
Lawrence, white tomorrow alter-
noon they will attempt to decisively
turn the home court advantage
against Ripon.

An added attraction to this Weeks
end’s tilts will be But) Burnett's
attempt to become the fifth Grin—
nellian to score 1000 points in his
college career. Bub currently needs
just 43 points to crack the barrier.

DUBUQUE, COE SMASH WRESTLERS

by Sigi Mt Offenbach

“I thought it couldn’t get worse.”
But it happened; the Grinnell matmen
were shutout twice. The Friday
match pitted the undermanned PiOr
neers against the Dubuque College
Spartans. The Spartans, in true c1357
sic fashion, speared the Grinnellians
to the mat Then came the Coe Col-
lege Cohawks, who also round the
Pioneers easy prey. Considering
that both Coe and Dubuque were sec,
and in their respective conferences
a year ago and that Grinnell lore
felted 48 points, it came as no sure
prise that Grinnell was defeated.

The Friday match against Dubuque
College offered little excitement to
our hearty Grinnell tans. Rick
Nightingale and Lance lsen both
were pinned in their matches. At
152, Jack Couch had a fairly inter-

esting match. After almost putting
his adversary out of commission,
Jack unfortunately succumbed to the
pin. Then Bob Donelan almostpinned
his opponent in the first period or
his match. After missing his golden
opportunity, Bob’s back was also
flush to the mat. Then came John
Pursell’s match at 191 pounds. Ale
though John’s opponent looked like
he could easily chew rocks (if not
boulders), John fought diligently and
wasn’t pinned. A sincere compliment
to John. Then Lee Gleysteen, our
relatively light heavyweight, was
confronted with a fire-breathing,
Behemouth. Easily 300 pounds,this
massive hulk quickly dispensed of
Light Lee. Poor Grinnell was shut-
out, 57 to zip,

On Saturday the Grinnell matmen
found themselves on the mat with

Grinnell’s AquarJocks continued
their Winning ways last Friday with
a victory over Knnx, extendingtheir
dual meet string to 20. At the Rock-
ford Relays on Saturday the Pit)-
neers finished second to the host
school in a strong lSrteam field.
The results at Knox showed Gri
nell on top by a score of 71-41 with
eight individual winners, Dan Weiss
Won the [000 yd. freestyle as well
as the 200 yd. butterlly The Beak,
Mike Daley, won both the 200 yd.
ireestyle and breastroke. Gabby
Ward was Grinnell‘s third doubler
winner with Victories in the 50 and

‘ 100 yd. freestyle events. Tom Rowat

was Victorious in the 200 back and
_ Bob Winters placed first in the 200
yd. individual medley.

At Rockford, Coach Obe’s squad
took two firsts as they were topped
by Rockford by a score of 42 to 30.
Rockford was the same team that
Won the Grinnell Relays here on
January 22. A meet record of 3100.7
for the 3th yd. individual medley
relay was set by Winters, Rowat,
and Mark Williams. Pete Bernstein
took individual honors in the l-meter
diving, teaming with Larry Huntoon
for the team title.

The swimmers take on Monmouth
in a dual meet at the RE. Complex
tomorrow aiternudn and will go up
against Carleton, Coe, Cornell, and
Stl Olaf the following weekend at
home. Carleton and Cornell are
rated with the best in the conference
this year.

the fighters of Coe. This time every»
one was pinned except Bob Donelan.
Rick Nightingale found his back on
the mat in the first period, as did
John Pursell and Lee Gleysteen.
Again Lee had a Brobdingnagian
opponent; he must he complimented
for having the courage to go on the
mat with such a beast. Jack Couch
also was pinned, but his fall came in
the second period. Again Bob Done-
lan almost defeated his adversary,
He and the Coe man he wrestled both
had an equal number ol points, but
Bob lost on riding time 3 to 2. As in
the Dubuque match, Coe got all the
marbles, the score was an identical
57 to nothing,

But don’t get depressed sports’
fans. This Week Grinnell voyages
to Monmouth for a double-dual con-
ference meet, and I can’t cover the
matches. instead we may have a
human interest story (or a diSr
interest story, as the case may be).

Knox Erosh

Grinnell’s freshman basketball
team took to their home court at
Darby Gym with talent and determin-
ation last Tuesday night, but lacking
in height, and tinaiiy in points, they
succumbed to a strong freshman
squad imported from Knox, 80-57.
Knox was able to control the boards,
and added to that an impressive
shooting accuracy, boasting a 52.5%
average for the game as a whole.

in spite of the wide 23 point mare
gin which separated the teams at
the final buzzer, the junior Pioneers
made a contest of the match, clos-
ing to with a points midway through
the second half, But Knox reasserted
its dominance in rebounds, and in
the last minutes consistently pene—
trated Grinnell’s defense for a slew

of close-range baskets to sew up a
victory.

Team leaders in Grinnell’s futile
effort were Nick Williams, with 15
points, and Jim Casey and Rick
Kellar. who tallied 14 and 12points,
respectively.
