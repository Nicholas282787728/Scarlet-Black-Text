Predicts

Future
Housing

by Bill Thomas

Predicting possible luture devlopments
in housing could start with seeing what
changes have happened. Five years ago, all
the men lived on North Campus, the women
on South Campus, Members 01 the opposite
sex were to be one’s dorm only (mm 2
in s on Sunday atternoons. The rule was
actually eniorced with some lrequency. Only
seniors could live of! campus, and the 601*
lege-owned houses (4 oi them) were mainly
for senior women, By student initiative
(occasionally backed up with considerable
pressure), several changes have been made:
visitation hours are now determined by
students; men and women live next door to
each other (just like in the real Worldl);
many juniors live on campus; and out of
six college houses, tour are now studentr
run coeops.

The rate of change seems fast, but in one
sense it was very slow. For each ol the
above changes, it was necessary iur stu-
dent government ottlcials to engage inardu.
ous discussions with administrators con-
cerning everything irorn morals to pre»
dicted drops in alumni {ind other gifts to
the college The [act that, at each step,
student morals took care 01 themselves
and the college's lriends proved able to
understand change didn't help much.

One thing which may make iuture changes
(aster, and at the same time better planned,
is the establishment last year of the hous-
ing committee, which contains a healthy
number of students. it this group main-
tains a healthy number of students, future
changes may come with less struggle.
Some oi those future changes are obvious.

The number or co-ops will certainly con-
tinue to increase {or a while. Segregation
by sex in the college dormitories may well
disappear entirely. Other changes are less
sure. It present trends toward breaking
down the separateness oi the classroom
continue, there will be more special interest
groups seeking to live together - the ele-
mentary education ﬂoor, the Local Efflu-
ents basement, or the Accuituration studies
annex. This movement would mitigate the
present campus atomism, in which each

individual Student cheeses a room iroi’n
nearly the entire campus (usually on the
basis 01 where she or he can get the most
physical space). This would greatly enhance
cohesion in the living units; for example,
look at the coeops and project houses. This
would in t rn produce a revival of hall and
floor activ ies.

Another possibility for change iies Wlth the
town, and its willingness to make housing
available to students. It appears that, at
the moment, students are filling almost all
the space available to them in town. The
possibility at a student apartment complex
has been talked about tor years, but has
never materialized. With the college's de-
site to increase enrollment, the availabil-
ity oi town housing is an important variable.

Students have at times expressed an in-
terest in working in isolation with a small
group, in a situation which makes day to
day 1i 1g the prime part or the learning
pFOC9)S» in pursuit of this, people suggested
that the college acquire one or more farm—
houses, with a small amount of land. Such
a living experience could in many ways be
regarded as almost an ”away semester”,
like the ACM programs, but the campus
would be close by, enabling at least good
contact with laculty Such arrangements
exist at some other colleges, where stu—
dents do such things as lG-credit indepen-
dents in communal living.

In general, things seem to point toagreat—
er diversification oi the possibilities of
living experience altered by the college.
Also, they point to an increased group orir
entation. More changes than we could pose
sibly predict will occur it students continue
to move away from a passive acceptance and
toward an active leadership in determining
their living options
