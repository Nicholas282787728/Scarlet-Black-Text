'18 Courses Have
40+ Enrollment

Eighteen classes this semester
have enrollments of more than forty
students, according to figures the
SSH has received from Registrar
Charles Sellers. Total enrollment
for the second semester is 1187
Students; 64 fewer thanfirstsemes—
ter.

The most heavily enrolled classes
are: Biology 122(Durkee, Fishman)
103 Students; Introductionto Philos»
ophy (Worley) 100 students; Course
in Search of a Topic (Schwartz) 94
students; Universe and Its Struc-
ture (Clotlelter) ’79 students; Gen-
eral Psychology (Morris) 49 stu-
dents; Man and Environment (ChriSA
tiansen) 63 students; Introductianto
Economics (Voertman, Hamilton) 52
students; Inorganic Chemistry
(Fisher) 51 students; Genetics
(Mendoza) 50 students; Developmen-
tal Psychology (Morris) 49 students;
Christian Scriptures (Haas) 45 stu-
dents; Foundations of Modern Physs
ics (Gale) and Contemporary Reli-
gious Thought (Eurkle) 44 students;
British History II (Don Smith) and
Survey ot Art (Trotter) 42 students;
Introduction to Social and Cultural
Anthropology (Caulkins)4o students.

Class enrollments were obtained
February 2 and were correct as of
that date.

613 males and 574 females are en-
rolled this semester as full-time
students; last semester there were
638 men and 613 women -- for a
total of 1251 students.

The attrition rate is less this year
than it was between semesters last
year, when the student body dropped
by 86 between semesters. Second
semester last year there were 1132
full-time atudents on campus.

Administrative personnel could not
pinpoint the reasons why there is
such a decline in enrollment between
semesters, since most students who
withdraw do not State their reasons
for leaving.

Charles Seller, Registrar and
Assistant Dean of the College,
pointed out that many Students are
participating in offrcampus pro-
grams or the ACM such as the Urban
Semester and the LeMoyneaowens
Exchange Program this semester.

State Senate Approves
l9 (18?) As legal Age

by Jack Doppelt

The Iowa Senate granted to year
olds full legal rights, Wednesday,
with the exception that the purchase
and possession of alcoholic
beverages be limited to 19 year olds.

The House had previously given 18
year olds “complete" legal rights
by an overwhelming margin. The
bill now goes back to the House for
confirmation,

The Senate, however, had reserva-
tions about some of the implications
of granting complete adult rights to
18 year olds. “We have to protect
high school students,” said George
Milligan (Rep, Des Moines), spon~
sor of the amendment limiting al—
canal to those over 19.

Senators concluded that most 18
year olds are in high school tor at
least part of their senior year. “It
is easy for someone‘to buy the six-
pack for his 15, 16, and 17 year old
friends and give it to everyone in
the car,” said Senator DeKoster of
Hull.

Senator John Tapscott, a Democra-
tic candidate for governor, believes
that bypassing 18 year olds is anact
of discrimination. ”ll that youth is
not able to handle liquor at the age
of 18, he will not be able to handle

Costa Rica Program up For Grabs

Economics Department Chairman
Robert Voertman, a founder and
strong supporter of the ACM Costa
Rican Development Program, is
asking Grinnell College to study the
feasibility oi assuming sponsorship
of the program should ACM decide
to drop it. In an interview with the
5&3, Voertman indicated that ACM
had showed its intention of“farming
out” as many of its overseas pros
grams as possible, and that Grin-
nell seems to be the logical candi-
date to pick up Costa Rican Develop-
ment.

The program, begun in 1964, has
long been supported by large num-
bers of Grinnell students. Voertman
indicated that until very recently,
almost half of the Students participa-

Faculty Sell-Evaluation

by Anne Waller

Determination not to get bogged
down in proceedings carried the
faculty through debate and passage
of a proposal ior increased membe
ship on the Freshman Year Commit-
tee and a series of faculty organiza-
tion proposals. The Magee proposal
for faculty evaluation, introduced
last fall, finally made it back to the
floor and will continue as the first
item on next week’s agenda.

The Freshman Year Committee is
a Student—iaculty»administration
committee dealing, obviously, with
special programs and problems of
the freshman year, including Such
things as the tutorial program. The
membership was augmented this
Monday by addition of the assistant
Dean of Students, a freshman to be
selected by SGA, and, a black stu-
dent to be designated by CBS. The
last representative was approved
despite concern as to how represen-
tative CBS is in terms of all the
black students at Grinnell and the
meaningfulness of this legislation
in terms of race relations at Grin-
nell.

Faculty Organization?

Proposals from the Faculty Organ-
ization Committee were revisions
to the FACULTY HANDBOOK,ON
ELECTIONS —- SCHEDULES AND
PROCEDURES. The proposals in~
cluded changing the selection of the

chairman and members on the Fac-
ulty Organization Committee to
coincide with the academic calendar
year and thus the other committee
selections; a reordering oi the
schedule of elections such that they
commence with at large taculty posis
tions, divisional positions, and de~
partmental positions; and changes in
the nominating and balloting procedr
ures for atrlarge elections to
encourage wider participation in
these elections.

Final item to be discussed was the
Magee proposal for taculty evaluar
tion by other faculty. This proposal
suggests establishment at a three
member faculty team to evaluate one
of their peers in the classroom
This, Magee asserts, would allevir
ate the problem otinaccurate evaIUr
ation caused by tile unevenness of
student evaluations and would theo-
retically help improve the indi-
vidual’s teaching pericrmance
through the members’ suggestions,
criticisms and observations of
teaching methods The issues here
seem in be whether classrooms
should be open to other faculty and
whether the time involved in such an
endeavor is worth the hcuelits which
would actually accrue.

The Magee proposal and a recom—
mendation to establish a Department
of Religious Studies will he the first
items on the agenda this Monday.

strip Mine Study

Current emphasis now focuses on
an Alcoa Aluminum strip mine pro-
ject occurring in the General River
Valley, home or the program. Slur
dies are being conducted by the par
ticipants to determine the biological,
sociological, and economics effects
of the mine operation on the sur-

rounding area. Several years will ,

be required to complete the study.

Students participating in the Costa
nican experience take a few classes
at the University of Costa Rica in
addition to their field research, and
hold seminars in the ACMaowned
house which serves as the program’s
home. Those who are not fluent in
Spanish spend their mornings forthe
first weeks of the program intntens
sive language training. The partici-
pants live with various Costa Rican
families during their stay in the
country.

Voertman indicated that the pro-
gram is an excellent overseas learn-
ing opportunity, unlike some offs
campus study Opportunities which he
described as little more than glori-
fled guided tours. The program’s
greatest asset, he feels, is the
trained resident staff. Since the
staff lives in Costa Rica year round,
it had developed a familiarity with
the area and an intimacy with the
people that would be impossible
for visiting protessors to obtain.

Logical Choice

Voertman feels that Gi‘innell should
be the logical choice for the adminis
stration of the Costa Rica Program
because he has worked closely with
the program since its inception and
will visit Costa Iiica in March at the

request of Robert Hunter to study
costs and possible modifications of
the program. He notes that two other
Grinnell professors, biologists Ken-
neth Christiansen and Laverne Dur—
kee, have served with the program.
Other colleges involved have at most
one professor familiar with the pro—
gram’s operation.

Voertman also feels that the pro-
gram is an effective teaching/learn—
ing experience and should be ma
tained at its present level. He defia
nitely does not want to see it degens
erate into the “overseas guided
tour” type of program. Grinnell
management, he believes, would
prevent the program’s deteriorr
ation.

Grants Cut Costs

Voertman is uncertain about pass
sible costs to the College -- this is
one of the issues he intends to exa-
mine more closely in March. How—
ever, the study program has always
received large foundation grants
which have prevented deficit opera»
tions. it is Currently operating under
a $100,000.00 National Science
Foundation grant. One of the duties
which the college would assume if it
took over the program’s operations
would be the work of continuing to
attract such grants.

Voertman concluded that Grinnell
should assume sponsorship of the
program if it will not cause either
a great manpower drain or an added
financial burden for the college.

emphasized

“We are merely trying to protect
the youth, not discriminate against
them,“ cautioned Eugene Hill of
Newton.

Amendments granting alcoholic
privileges to 20 year olds and re
taining the present age limit of Zl
were both deieated. An amendment
granting drinking rights to onlythose
over 43 was facetiously proposed by
Senators Minette Doderer and Wile
liam Palmer.

The majority rights bill had given
18 year s all the privileges and
responsi ties of adulthood except
that social services, such as foster
care, would still be provided tothose
in School until the age of 21. These
rights include marrying without par»
ental consent, obtaining a chauf—
feur’s license, being legally liable
ior contracts, and licensing to praCr
tice professionally.

In referring to students under 21,
Senator Dean Arbuckle of Jefferson
contended, ”they're not concerned
about present restrictions and
they're not in any hurry to have it
changed."

To those who are, the bill should
become law July 1, but may be ens
acted through emergency legis-
lation. This would then become law
April 17, in time for finals.

Hill Urges
Drinking At 21

by John Morrissey

One of the more active participants
in Wednesday's Iowa Senate debate
on the fullsrights-at-IB bill was the
senator from Grinnell's district,
Eugene Hill (ReprNewton). Senator
Hill proposed an amendment that
would retain age 21 as the legal
drinking age.

Hill said that 50% of all fatal acci-
dents ih lowa are caused by drunk
drivers. Of these drinking-related
accidents, 40% involved young adults
between 18 and 21 years old. Thus
his amendment would provide “a a
measure of protection to the driving ,
public, including those 13 to 21 years
old," :

Hill recognized that today‘s 2
18-yearrolds are “bright, and know
ledgeable, and enthusiastic, but they
laCk the maturity necessary" to be 5
able to handle liquor. This maturity, ;
he said, ”comes only with age and .
experience,” ‘

Hill’s amendment was defeated, but
so was the provision to make 18 the
legal drinking age; the Senate de-
cided that 19 was more fitting. Be»
for the bill becomes law, however,
it must be ironed out in a Senate-
House conference committee, has
cause the House voted to establish
legal drinking age at 18.
