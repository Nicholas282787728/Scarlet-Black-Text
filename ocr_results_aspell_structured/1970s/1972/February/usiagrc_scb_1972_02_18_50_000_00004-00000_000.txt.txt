Black Library

The Black Library is a good idea. Centralizing the library’s
holdings on Black Studies would aid serious students of the area to
locate needed materials more easily. Many black students wish to
have the Black library so that they can use is as a special place to
study and to find handy the manh books now scattered throughout
Burling’s collection that deal with their past and culture. it the
books were in a central location it would be an inducement to other
students to browse and become familiar withacollection of writings
which many of us should know more about.

We do not think the library’s collection would be damagingly
'ragmented, because all the books would still be in Hurling and
would be indexed in the central card catalog. Because of the catav
loging system used herebooks on most areasare scattered through-
out the library anyway. A person looking for several books will
usually journey to several parts of the library. Compared to the
present situation, any inconvenience imposed on someone who needed
a book in therBlack Library would be minimal. For research in
the area of Black Studies much of the inconvenience would be
eliminated.

So, unless the cost of the project is overshwleming, a permanent
Black Library should be established. The estimated cost of res
cataloging the collection is about $10,000 , $5 per book. We think
this estimate is a high one and that the actual cost will turn out to
be well within the means of the college.

Ted Glick

A movement is now underway to bring Ted Glick, one of the defen»
dants in the Harrisburg conspiracy trial andaformer Grinnell stu—
dent, to campus as a speaker. The Joint Board endorsed the proposal
at Wednesday‘s meeting by the rather half-hearted vote of 6-4, with
live abstentions.

Glick attended Grinnell for two years, leaving in 1969 after his
sophomore year. Most seniors remember him chiefly for his acti-
vities during the spring ‘of 1969: His most dramatic action that
semester was to invert the American flag on central campus, as a
distress signal to protest the war in Viet Nam. This created an
uproar; townspeople were angry and PoliceChief Bill Peters came
on campus and took the flag into custody for a day. Students decided
in a lengthy meeting in the South Loungethat lasted after the Closing
time of the Forum to canvass the communityand explain their views
on the war.

After leaving Grinnell Ted actively worked against the draft; he
eventually served a term in prison after being convicted of partici-
pating in a raid onadraft board office. Last spring, Glick became a
defendant in the Harrisburg trial when the government shifted the
locus of the indictment from an alleged plot to plant bombs in
the Washington, D.C. sewer system and kidnap Henry Kissinger
to an alleged plan to resist the draft by violent means.

Ted Glick’s distress over the war was no doubt sincere, and it led
him to a series of rather extreme actions that semester. At a draft
resistance rally the day of the flag inversion, he turned his draft
card over to Mr. Haas, so Mr. Haas could forward it to Glick’s
draft board. Later in the year, Ted declared he would last until the
faculty undertook to remove ROTC from the Grinnel campus immedir
ately. (The faculty had already voted to phase out the program over
the next three years.) Finally, when Curtis Tarr, who now heads
the Selective Service System and at that time was leaving his post
as President of Lawrence University totakean administrative posi-
tion in the Air Force, was awarded an honorary degree at the 1969
Commencement, Glick and others were on hand to protest by briefly
disrupting the ceremony.

Glick would like to come to Grinnell and speak on “Non-Violent
Revolution" or "Pilgrimage for Freedom”»- or so he writes in
the form letter Mr. Haas received. Some members of the Joint
Board of House Presidents who remember Glick as a hallmate
and classmate (he was even an 5&3 columnist) seem reluctant to
encourage his visit. Perhaps this accounts for the unusual 6-4-5
vote giving the Board’s support to Mr. Haas’ efforts to bring him
here.

The Doppelt Effect

Grlnnell -- One Of 47 Safe Places

Grinnell, Iowa (Population, content)
has been declared one of the 47 “safe
places” to live in the United States,

In a sazrpage book, Safe Places,
to be published in March, David and
Holly Franke listed our budding
haven as one otonly seven such towns
in the Midwest.

To quality as a safe place, the town
had to have a lower crime rate in
1969 than the national average. Those
communities that listed any demons
strations or riots from May, 1968
through the end of 1969 were
excluded.

It is comforting to know that any
activities on campus in May, 1970
have not been regarded as demons
strations.

Grinnell had no murders, rapes
or mayor robberies, and only three
auto thefts in 1969.

“Once We established that it was
reasonably safe, we attempted to
determine whether the community
was also a pleasant and desirable
one in which to live, ” the Frankes
wrote.

One or the overriding factors in
classifying Grinnell “liveable” was
the “cultural, social, athletic, and
recreational advantages of having in
its midst one or the nation's most
respected small liberal arts col-
leges.”

That can only refer to old dope—
infested, rape—rumored, and food»
poisoned Grinnell College. We have
tinally done it. in print. Grinnell
College has been vindicated. Viva
la Franke.

The Frankes note that in their 3-1/2
month, 20,000 mile trek, “we found
that no place, however small or iso-
lated, is sate trom the corrosive
inﬂuence or drugs,"

To the Editors:

It’s a minor point, i know, but in
the interests of journalistic accur-
acy and out or respect for a close
friend, I feel obligated to point out
that Ann Cassel’s article, Six Have
Tried and Died Here (in the Feb. 11
literary supplement) should really
have been called Seven Have Tried
and Died Here. It's hard to fault
Miss Cassel for neglecting to ins
clude Montage, of which only one
issue was ever published, in her list
of Grinnell's literary magazines.
But it strikes me as unfair to prev
tend, deliberately or not, that Gary
Giddins’s noble experiment never
happened

Gary was chosen editor oi Nous at
the end of the 1968-69 school year.
Funds for the publication of a lite-
rary magazine had, Ibelieve, been
completely cut, and the Scarlet 5:.
Black had taken the magazine under
its wing. Gary planned to revise the
format or the magazine and feature,
in addition to fiction and poetry,
interviews, criticism (of anything),
student artwork and photography,
and anything else that people might
care to submit. He also had no come
punctions about soliciting contribu-
tions from people who neither at-
tended nor taught at Grinnell Col-
lege. He changed the name at the
magazine to Montage and put out an
impassioned call for writers, art-
ists, and typists.

The response was something less
than staggering. Gary didn‘t quite
emerge empty-handed, but it was
all he could do to scrape up enough
material for his first issue by the
end of the first semester.

Alter numerous weeks oi editing,
layout arranging, and hassling with
printers, most of it done by Gary
singlerhandedly, Montage made its
debut in the Spring of l970. That
historic Issue contained, among
other things, interviews with B. E.
King and author Robert Reisner,
excerpts from M. M. Liberman’s
Maggot and Worm and John Keeble's

Many students wonder whereGrinr
nell College has achieved the dis-
tinction of being one of the top ten
liberal arts colleges, The Frankes
point out that The Ford Foundation
and the Rockefeller Foundation rank
Grinnell as one or the top eight
liberal arts colleges to receive sub—
stantial grants for educational inno»
vations

”One of the top eight" of course
means the eighth, lf we were seventh,
they would have written ”one of the
top seven.” So, ighth isn’t bad.

The Frankes Vi ited Grinnell in
August, 1970, when the college was
deserted. However, the remarks of
the townspeople cast a favorable
light upon townrgown relations. Be-
cause they were pressed tor time,
the Frankes’ direct observations
were limited Much of their statISr
tics about Grinnell, from education
to medical facilities, came from
Chamber oI Commerce-style pam-
phlels.

Al Finder, the managing-editor
of the Grinnell Herald-Register, re-
ferred to in the book as “the offlr
old] town Crier,“ showed the
Frankes the town. “Unemployment
is practically nil," said Finder
“Anyone who wants a job can find
one, except some college students
looking for part—time or summer
work.”

Grinnell students have been fortu-
hate enough to temporarily inherit
the safety of the Grinnell sanctuary.
But two students have been sheltered
in "safe” towns tor a good part or
their lives.

Ruth Karnath has lived all her life
in Winona, Minnesota, a town also
designated as a safe place. She was
aware that Winona was a relatively

pressive sampling of student writ
ing, artwork, and photography. Co—
plEs were proudly stuIled into mail»
boxes. A distressingly ( but not uni
typically) large number found their
way into trash baskets without ever

Gary accumulated enough material
for a second Montage, including
several short stories and a pre-
viously unpublished manuscript by
Lenny Bruce, but Grinnell shutdown
in the wake Of the CambodiarKentr
Jackson horror before the issue went
to press.

Montage never caused much of a
stir (except among those who both
ered to read it) and it is likely that
few people even noticed its absence
from Miss Cassel's list. But the
work and the pure love thatGary put
into it deserves to be remembered.
Gary Giddlns was a Grinnell ins
dividual, with “the compunction to
think for himself” and a natural
aversion to “the ordinary and trite”.
A sentence or two acknowledging
the existence of Montage would have
been appropriate,

To The Editors:

I’d like to add a parent's observar
tion of your food service Saga.

We had lunch there in the dining
room on Sunday, January 16, 1972.
There was adequate food and the var
iety ordinarily would be satlSv
factory; BUT the chicken that I had
was bloody and tasteless, the potar
toes appeared to be an instant mix,
cold and tasteless; the gravy rapidly
congealed into a yellow tasteless
blob

My husband chose the stroganoff
with noodles. His complaints somer
what echoed mine; the mentappeared
old and the gravy was a whltetastev
less blob.

The food was not bad food but pre
pared without thought to either its
flavor or visual appeal.

It would seem a little more care in
preparation and seasoning would go

safe place, but recalls that “my
brother was a Juvenile delinquent in
9th grade and our lug boat was van—
dalized now and then.”

Ruth added that Winona isabitlars
ger and is still quiet and calm. “But
my parents are starting to lock the
door. There are only the twootthem
left,” she said.

Ruth views Grinnell and Winona as
“similar places." She preters
smaller towns, out plans to spend
part oi her future in Minneapolis
working for the Bureau on Indian
Affairs.

Terrence Seeberger, who has lived
in Tiffln, Ohio (another safe place)
tor the past three years, can’t res
member any crimes in Tillin.

“The usual offenses involved
getting picked up for speeding or
drinking,” he recalled.

Terry pointed out that Tlffin is
bigger than Grinnell and “might have
had a little more to do.” Terry also
mentioned that the label “safeplace
mentioned that the label “safe
place“ might imply a “dead town”
to some people.

The Frankes book, Safe Places in-
cludes examples of many varied rec-
reational and social activities In
Grinnell that should dispel these
doubts, However, there is one puz-
zling sample. The book mentions
“fishing and plcnicking areas at
Lake Nyanza Park ” This must un-
doubtedly have been taken from
Grinnell promotional literature be—
cause the sole fish surviving in Lake
Nyanza was last seen spitting up
mud.

But thanks to the activities offered
by Grinnell College, the Frankes can
honestly proclaim, “who says small
towns are dead7”

a long way toward easing some oithe
justifiable complaints about thelood
service.

Further after having sampled the
food I find it hard to understand why
action is not being taken at this time
(not next year) to improve the food.

Possibly the President of the Col»
lege and his Deans should make a
practice of eating daily tor an ex-
tended period (let's say a month) in
the dining room for their evaluations
of the food.

To the Editors:

Last week’s SLIB report on faculty
recruitment said, “Two people have
been interviewed for the American
Studies position, but neither ofthem
completely tilled the qualifications
necessary, so the department is still
looking,” It is imperative that this
report be corrected. The fact is that
the Executive Council originally auv
thorized a joint appointment in Ans
thropology and American studies.
The two departments have been unv.
able to Iind anybody qualified forthat
job. In American Studies, we have
interviewed two candidates who are
extraordinarily well qualified, in
rather different ways. Either Candi»
date would be very nsetul to the
college. We are presently weighing
the value to us of each of them, and
considering alternative job descrip-
tions. It is my hope that an utter can
be made to one of them soon.

Charles G. Cleaver,
American Studies

Editor's Note: when contacted by
the SliB last week Mr. Cleaver said
that no offer had yet been made to
a candidate in American Studies and
that the candidates so far inter-
viewed did nol fulfill the qualifica-
tions stipulated for the job. We were
not told that the department was con-
sidering a change in the job descrip-
tion, so we incorrectly assumed that
the department was still looking for
suitable candidates.
