The Scarlet and Black

Mngee Discusses International Crisis In Tuesday Class

Alter very little sleep over 250
students and faculty members pack-
ed ARH auditorium Tuesday morning
to hear James Magee's (Political
Science) 8:30 speech on the present
situation in Vietnam. Mr. Magee
prelnced the talk w‘th a personal
opinion that this cri s in Vietnam
is probably the most serious policy
decision made by the U.S. Since the
Cuban Missile Crisis.

Mi'. Magee summarized the implis
cations of our military action in
relation to the parties involved and
gave some insights into Nixon's
personality. Assessing the present
military tactics he surmised that
they will have little effect on Han-
oi’s present offensive and that their
full impact will not be felt for weeks.

He used Nixon's personality as a
partial explanation ior his tactics,
From “reliable sources” he said
one gets the impression that Nixon
is “belligerent and responds in
aggressive tough ways.”

Probably the major concern otmost
of the audience was the decision’s

read some Vietnamese poetry. One
of the poems observed that “some-
times anger is the only form ollove”
and another urged people to “strug-
gle ior peace”.

After Mike Rosenfeld reviewed
Nixon‘s speech and reported on the
latest news developments, Russ
opened the floor to townspeople for
their comments. Mrs. Sydney Chips
man, who organized actions in town
during the Cambodia invasion two
years ago, said she thought the meet
ing was on to a good start and urged
those present to carry on with their
activities. She said she had yust
taken her 4—yearvold son to the
Indochina exhibit at the Memorial
Building that day, and that the child
had kept pulling her back to part oi
the exhibit that showed children who
had been mutilated during the war.
“when he asked me, ‘Why do we have
wars, Mommy7', I couldn't answer
him," Mrs. Chlpman said “Can we
answer him here tonight?"

Dean of the College Waldo Walker
then expressed the “deep regret”
of himself and President Leggett
with the situation in Vietnam. He
said he would support “any con-
structlve action” to alter President
Nixon's decision.

Before the suggestions tor action
were discussed, a few others made
comments, It was clear that few of
the people in Herrick that night favA
ored closing the college; in tact,
many students suggested that the
college should stay open longer,

Phil Sasich seemed to state the tone
of the meeting with his initial
comment. We are all angry, “he
said," and we have to keep that
anger.” He suggested that the action
chosen should not be “a shot in the
dark thing," but rather a continuing
demonstration of opposition to
Nixon's policies. “Maybe we are
getting a little beyond the tactics
of the past Idon't know But we
have to remember that Richard
Nixon and the instititutions of this
country are the enemies, not the col-
lege or the townspeople or the
American people. What we want to do

is castrate Richard Nixon'”

Russ McGregor listed the sugges—
tions proposed at the Griniiell House
meeting earlier. The l2 suggestions
included proposals for blocking rush
hour traffic along Interstate 80. a
candlelight march through Grinnell

types oi marches or picketing
in town, a demonstration (including
civil disobedience) at a munitions
plant, blocking ot a Rock island train
carrying munitions, a telegram
drive from Grinnell, 3 march to Des

the way, keeping the school open
with the provision that students could
get extensions on workssperhaps

Tuesday to approve this). estate-
ment by President Leggett in behali

international effectsssporticularly
with regard to the Soviet Union.
Since Russia does not have control
over Hanoi it is not free to re-
spond as it did in Cuba, Mr Magee
thinks, Nixon's speech was essen—
tially an ultimatum t0 the Soviets
and North Vietnamese, Mr Magee
believes that Nixon has left no out
that would allow any of the parties
to save face, His demands to the
North Vietnamese ior an internas
tionally supervised ceasefire and
a return of POW'S are liable to
be unacceptable in their present
iorm. Since Russia is no longer
conventionally and strategically
interior to the U.S., she will have
to react it her ships are damaged
and their action could greatly ems
barl‘ass the United States.

The talk then opened up to come
ments and questions from the audis
ence. Gregory chri-oti (History)
and Robert Grey (Political Science)
said they ieit Russia would be com—
pelled to respond and recalled that
Krushcllev’s fall from power was

ties Union and other similar organis
zations tor legal help, and a dems
onstration against General Tele-
phone and Electronics (which has a
regional office in Grliinell). Someone
suggested from the door that
students should go to Washington to

‘ protest or that a town-wide fast he

organized

The discussion which followed"
for almost one and a half hours"
rambled from point to point. but most
of the proposals were discussed.
David Abel (Music) began by say»
ing he was glad that so many tac-
ulty members had come to the
meeting, recalling that he had been
one of a very few laculty to attend
the student meetings two years ago.
He hoped that some of then) would
“hang around for the action” later
on.

The ideas to block Interstate 80,

to march to Des Moines, to act
against General Telephone,- to stop
a munitions train received little
support from the group, and they
were hardly discussed. However,
the suggestion to demonstrate at a
munitions plant received support
from many of those present. One
student suggested that Nixon himself
had recommended that we should
keep the weapons oi war out or the
hands of “international outlaws"
and that blocking operations nta
munitions plant would accomplish
exactly that: Others suggested that
such ii demonstration would accoms
plish the goals of doing something
eiiective and getting publicity. Mike
Siegel urged that any action at n
munitions plant which was being cons
templated by a taction oi the stud-
ent body ought to be presented to
the whole group, because “it will
reﬂect on us. ” The matter was
never resolved at the meeting, zip-
parently because no definite course
of action had been chosen A meet-
ing was scheduled for later that night
in ARH to further discuss the matter.
One student suggested that students
at other schools be contacted and
given an opportunity to participate
in such a demonstration.
Neither the proposal to launch a tele-
gram drive or to ask President Leg-
gett to make a statement was even
discussed at the meeting.

Students discussed the pros and
cons of going to Washington; one
pointed out that it would he a method
oi responding immediately and
directly to President Nixon, But
one of the students wllo had gone into
Washington two weeks beiore to sup
port the Gravel bill said it would
accomplish little without some ef-
iective organization, which would
have to be nationwide. Jenna Finch
suggested wailing ilntil people in
Washington decided what should or
could he done. James Magee (Polls
tical Science) said that the Wash
ington police could handle crowds oi
up to 250,000 people “with no
sweat”, and said that he felt such
a demonstration would have little
effect
Several times students mentioned
the possibility of closing the school
or oi making special arrangements

in dlly |lle result oi his handling
oi the Cuban Missile Crisis

Even Sine-Soviet relations may
force Russia to act, it she does
not respond, China will have to
Alan Jones (history) suggested
that Nixon‘s speech indicated a clls
huge in the aims oi the United
States There no longer seems to
be a commitment to support the
South Vietnamese; the speech indi-
cated that we are now interested in
getting our own troops out at Viet~
ham and not continuing to support
the present government

The analogy with the Cuban Mis‘s
sile Crisis was used throughout
the discussion Mr ouiroit iclt

ior students to get incompletes in
their work. The sentiment of the
meeting generally agreed with Jenna

Finch. who said that the school
should remain open, so students can
stay together and continue working
together to oppose Nixon, Other
students urged that the strongest
possible gesture should be made in
opposition to Nixon, even iiit niennt
closing the school. others urged that
the school he closed only ior very
definite and deliberate reasons
None even urged that the fliculty meet
in the near future to vote on the
question

There was lengthy discussion on
whether a march should he held
and what sort of a match it should
be. Mitch Erickson urged that a
march that night could "serve as a
focal point" for actions oftlle group
Mike Roseni‘eld suggested that silent
marches had not been effective in the
past. “The time to be soft for peace
is past," he said, “and now is the
time to be loud ior peace ” The
discussion of this point was cnms
plicaied because many seemed to be
trying to decide whether a march
or a demonstration at a munitions
plant, (but not both) should be staged.
One student suggested that both kinds
of actions were possible.

Mr, Magee presented a Sense of
proposals which included organi he
a petition campaign on campus, a
march oi some kind downtown during
business hours, a petition drive
downtown, and an attempt to send
panels of “instant experts” from the
college to talk to groups in the come
munity.

He stressed that he thought that
the nature of the war hail fundamen-
tally changed and that the Current
situation“nas the possibility of being
at least as serious as the CubaiiMis-
sle Crisis " He felt that attempts

Rev Neu‘ell Davis of the United

suggested that an eiiective method
would be lor the whole college corn»
niunity and anyone else who cared
to come along to march every day
at a certain time in the aiternoon
through the downtown area. The
first such Inarcll was scheduled for
Tuesday aiternoon,

There were several proposals ior
setting up a bail fund. About $2000
dollars remained in hall social
funds, and students suggested that
they be reallocated to the hail innd
One student said that the money ior
the senior gift could be given to
the bail iund.

After more than an hour and a hail

Anne Walter suggested that n
candlelight niar through town right
away would “give us a chance to
make an immediate gesture." She
urged that the meeting adjourn so the
march could begin Rev. Davis otter»
ed to get Candles from the United

Church of Christ for use (luring the
march, and suggested that marchers
quietly sing something like "Give
Pence a Chance" as they walked
along

When the candles arrived the march
began Some students from the meets
ing had gonc to the dorms to ins
fol‘ln people that the march was lak-
mg place, and several people who had
not been at the meeting appeared
for the march

Marchers softly sang such songs as
“Give Peace A Chalice". "We Shall
Overcome”, “America”, ~Where
Have'All‘ net-”lowers Gone", Kilms ‘
baya”, and “Blowing in the Wind”,
The line was about iour blocks long,
and at any given time, diiierent
parts oi the line were singing tour
or live oiiierent songs.

The march route was as follows:
irom Herrick Chapel to Sixth Aves
nue, then West to Broad Street,
then north to 8th Avenue, then West
to Spencer Street, north to 9th Ave»
iuie, east to Spring Street, north to
10th Avenue, east to Main street,
south to ‘ltll Avenue, east to Park
Street, north to the alley by the
Fine Arts Building, around central
campus, and to nagpoies. The march
ended with four minutes oi silence
around the iingpoles at about 2:15
a.m.

About haliivay through the march,
Grinnell Police and iowa Highway
patrolman began guarding iniei's
sections through which the marchers
passed to prevent traiiic accidents
The march was peaceful and without
incident.
