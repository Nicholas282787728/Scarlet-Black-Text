Tonight and Sunday evening the in
ternational Weekend provides the
campus with a showing ortwo Akira
Kurosawa’s films: The Throne of
Blood (Japanese title, Castle of the
Spider’s Web) and The Bad Sleep
Well.

These films use two different time
periods (16th and 20th century Ja-
pan) to deal with the same theme:
the plight oi the individual during
a period of intensive social and mo-
ral change. Kurosawa's focus is ale
ways on the attempt of the individ-
ual to control his life in :l society
which is patterned to contain and
channel the individual. Only during
times oi great social upheaval (like
late Ashikaga; late Tokugawa
Yojimho, Seven Samurai, and post
World War ll) can the individual
escape from the crunch oi social
patterns.

The epic quality in Kurosawa‘s very
socially conscious iilms isportray-
ed in the resolution of the tension
between the freed individual and the
resurrection of the social order.
Only those who do not understand the
struggle (the peasantry in The
Throne oi Blood) or who iully der
dicate themselves to one side or
the other prevail. The hero in
The Bad Sleep Well is avenging
the murder of his father by the
President oi the Company. He wa-
Vers in his commitment and is thus
also murdered by his Iather’s mur-
derers. The President and the Com-
pany survive.

The key element which eliminates
the melodramatic is the complica-

tion that in fighting the evilness of
society one becomes equally evil.
The hero in The Bad Sleep Well
recognizes this and in his attemptto
revive his own humanity his guard
is let down and he is murdered In
The Throne of Blood the hero des-
troys himself in his search turpOWr
er. The broken continuity oi social
relations elicits his vain attempt to
take power. He is destroyed in the
process.

Kurosawa’s two films combine soc-
ial comment with great drama.
Throne of Blood mingles Noh and
Western acting and music in a sa-
mural tale (based on Macbeth)which
builds up through murder, conspir-
acy,"and ghosts to a stunning clir
max. To provide tor more realism,
Kurosawa ordered real arrows used
against the hero. The effect is spece
tacular. The drama in The EadSleep
Well is more intellectual: the story
unfolds through the Juxtaposition oi
the false from the realnwhileview-
ing what appears to be a iormal
proper wedding ceremony, we are
informed through the comments of
the newspaper reporters that the
groom is marrying the boss‘s
daughter not ior wealth but to get
close enough to kill him!

This film is one of the most dra-
matic exposes or modern Japanese
business and political power andthe
relations between the two, The Pres-
ident oi the Company makes aphone
call to someone high up in governe
ment beiore liquidating his accuser.
This is a dramatic act because it
reaches into the close connections
between big business andbiggovernr
ment. The modern commentaryplus
the plot results in a powerlul pre-
sentation, If you’re interested ina

leggell Calls For Conference g

Nov-lulu! 17, 1972

“t

president Glenn Leggett in an article appearing in last Sunday's
bes Moines Register called ior an iowa conierence on higher
education and the professions in order to “ﬁll the vacuum which
now exists in student expectations ior the lite they wish to lead
aiter graduation." Observing that the plans ior the American bi-
centennial in 1976 are proceeding in a :‘halting" manner, Leggett
suggests that a series oi such state conierences may lend more
importance to the bicentennial observance than would an agenda

at celebratlons

The article appeared opposite the editorial page oi Sunday's
Register as one oi a series oi “Guest Opinion” pieces published

by the Des Moines newspaper.

“With turbulence and tragedy marking our involvement in In-
dochina and a host at tough issues aiieoting the country domese
tically,” he said, “it is not easy for us as citizens to look toa
time when we can be in a celebratory mood.” Rather the most
significant tribute we could pay the iounding iathers is to exert
“the same hard eiiort that they made in charting what this nation

should be.”

Appropriate would be “carefully planned grass-roots discussion
(5) oi the objectives and logistics oi American progress," and
since "the iuture oi this country is maniicstly represented in (the)
educational system,” an analysis oi that system and the profesr
sions [01‘ which it trains should head the list oi discussion prior-

ities

Such conierenccs, Leggett concluded, would not only assist stur
dents in iuliilling their goals but would also “bring together those
groups, both in and outside the educational system..., who must

E communicate if we are to restore some sense of community

in American life "

Joint Board Debates Guidelines

by Mike Breed

Yes, folks, the Joint Board met
again this Week for another thril-
ling adventure into the world of sem-
antics and nit-picking. Top items
for consideration this week were
the Treasurer and Auditor guide
lines and the new, improved pet
policy. Uniortunately, but expect-
edly, they took so long rehashing
the wording on the guidelines that
they never even got to the pet po-
licy, so that will have to come up
next week.

A report from the Student Coor-
dinator’s Otfice on the Pro Musical
concert was also distributed. Many
mistakes were made in the organie
zation of the event, and the report
seems to have done a iairly de-
cent joh of picking these out. Per-
haps the most glaring mistake was
that “Student members of the com—
mittee were never utilized in the
preliminary planning oi the event,
not even in an advisory capacity."
Rod McVeigh, one of the student
members on the committee, was
present at the meeting and ﬁelded
questions about the report. Although
he said the report was “basically
factual” it was generally his opin—
ion that the problems encountered
arose from the inexperience or the
committee members and had been
ironed out: structural changes have
been made in the committee since
the Pro Musica concert.

This Still leaves open the whole
question oi the expensive reception
which followed the conceit-this res
caption used up one—third olthe come
mittee’s incidental expense fund
Clearly, the best interests of the
student body at large were not rer
presented when such a small, exe
pensive gathering was iunded out or
student monies. And, of coursg,

there is the issue oi student money
(HORRORSZ‘) being used to purchase
alcoholic beverages,

0n the whole it would be uniair
to judge the whole program or the
Public Events Committee on the
basis oi one concert. Clearly This
takes were made, but the plea oi
inexperience is probably valid.

By passing the guidelines tor an
SGA Treasurer, the Board iormal-
ized its wish to divide the tuner
tions or policy making and book
keeping The guidelines themselves
are relatively simple. Their enacts
merit, however, clariiies the role
oi the Treasurer as the policy mak
ing intermediary between the Board
and the Auditor The treasurer will
also serve as Chairman oithe Fir
nance Committee. in this role he
will be responsible for submitting a
proposed budget each semester to
the Joint Board,

The Auditor’s guidelines are much
more extensive and complicated.
Basically they set a general adminr

istrative policy for the Auditor and
formalize many traditionalpolicies.
An important change is that they
provide for an "open voucher of
$10 or less” to be issued to Hall
Presidents on request, This will
allow for more ﬂexible planning
of events, Reimbursements Will be
made to the House Presidents on
approval by the SGA Treasurer,

During one ofthe discussions Craig
Kugisakl came up with what must
be the SGA quote ofthe year~“what
are we discussing anyway?” The
House Presidents seem to be'living
in the dream world that whatever
they do will last lorever and has
to be perfect. They should realr
Ize, oi course, that the things they
are modifying are modified every
year :ad intinitum.

The proposed pet policy should be
good tor a lot oi discussion, Among
other things it makes licensing man ~
datory, provides for iines ii animal
owners tail to comply, and pro-
vides for a Student Dog Catcher.
All in all its a really complete
documenthcovering subject ranging
irom having insects as pets (slricb
ly iorbidden) to a list of legitimate
complaints (e g. displeasing odors)
"and will probably be controver-
sial no matter what the Boards do
to it. l-lopeiully, whatever is passed
will penalize pet owners who dise
regard the rights of others but will
not put up too many administrative
obstacles to pet ownership,
