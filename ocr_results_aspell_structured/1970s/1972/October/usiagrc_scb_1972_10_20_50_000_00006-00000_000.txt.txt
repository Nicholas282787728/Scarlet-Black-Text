When this 25-year-old researcher
wanted to investigate a possible cancer treatment,
we gave him the go-ahead.

We also gave him the right to fail.

At Kodak, it's not unusual for a 25ryearrold like Jim
Carroll to win the title oi senior research physicist. Like any
company involved in a lot of basic research, Kodak has lelt
the pressure of modern technology and the need (or young,
tresh thinking. So we hire the host t cnt we possibly can,
and then give them as much respensi lity as they can hanr
dle. whatever their age.

We have departments and divisions, like any company.
What we don’t have are preconceived ideas about how an
expert scientist’s time should he spent. So when we received
a request lrcrn the medical community tor assistance in ex-
perimenting with lasers as a possible cancer treatment, we
turned to 25ryearrold Jim Carroll, who is deep in laser techs

nalogy, and gave him the go~ahead. He built two half-billion
watt laser systems, one of which Kodak has donated to the
National Institute of Health, .

The lasers proved unsuccesslul in treating cancer, but
we’d make the same decision all over again. We entered laser
technology because we have a stake in business, We let a
young researcher help the medical community look for a
means of cancer treatment because we have a stake in the
luture or mankind.

To put it another way, We’re in business to make a
proﬁt. But in iurthering our own needs. we have oiten fur—
thered society's. Alter all, our business depends on our soci-
ety. So we care what happens to it.

Kodak

More than a business.
