5000 Iowans Heat McGovern Speak

Hughes and a rather lengthy cam-
paign speech by Sen. George Mc-
Govern.

Those attending the largest polie
ticil gathering in the state yet this
year heard the Senator repeat his
charges about the Nixon adminis-
tration's closeness to big business
and the John Connelly types, and for
the ﬁrst time in the campaign, reier
to his opponent as ”Tricky Dick.”
He also wondered it his campaign
would raise much money throughthe
dinner because “after tour years
of leon‘s inlloticn, a law pieces
of chicken and an apple cost al-
most on " , ,
Despite what many say about the
type of person who supports Sen
McGovern, this crowd was as dis
verse as any. While there was a
noticaole number of students, there
was a large contingent oi union peo-
ple, obvious because or their UAW
jackets, and many senior citizens
who applauded wildly when the Sen—
ator charged Nixon with deceit in
claiming credit for the 20% increase
in some] security payments.

Brock: Nixon’s Active Appeal To Youth

by Steve Nunn

sin \lttsltmglvll tun-en.
Washington, D. C.-7Tennessee’s
41—year-old Sen. Bill Brock is head
of Young Voters for the President,
yuuth wing at the Nixon campaign
in an interview, Brock looked back
over his etlorts at rounding up
first-time voters for the man who
is, according to an inscribed photo
hanging in Book's senatorial ole
lice, “his triehd, Dick Nixon .,

chair, toying with one or the dozen
or so pipes he keeps in a rack lust
behind him, Brock maintains itis

'all paying oil.

“We don’t concede a single state
to George McGovern. We want to
take all 50,” he asserts,

His strategy to do that is twor
fold

First, he campaigns in the name
of the President, not of the Re
publican party (“though of course
we hope some 0t it Will carry over
to the party”)

And he considers it important to
give young voters a high degree
at autonomy and responsibility in
the campaign.

That, of course, contrasts with
charges o1 ”management" and
“orchestration” that have been levr
eled at the Republican convention

also corordlnated.

These charges are overblown, aCs
cording to Brock’s press assistant,
Bill Goodwin, who was also present
during the interview, Goodwin wasa
prime organizer at Miami.

“We just organized, we had to.
We had thousands or people-swe’d
never handled anything that big. But
orchestration? You can’t make peo»
ple yell like that,” Goodwin said,

"And there was no chaperoning,”
he added, ”They didn’t have tocome
along to the convention or to meet
the President if they didn’t want
to.”

But he concedes that those who did
not participate in the organized ac—
tivities were"ontheiz‘own,"TranS-
portation and other services were
provided only lorohicially approved
functions.

Brook‘s strategy tor Nixon is the
some he used two years ago inTenr
nessee, when he defeated liberal
Sen, Albert Gore,

“Gore looked down on the young
people, and he didn’t get a very
big youth vote, though he thought he
would,” said Brock. “Youth was
asking for a voice. We gave it to
them, We knew they could he more
effective with their contemporaries
than we could anyway.”

Tapping the youth vote, Brock iS
convinced, provided his margin o1
victory over Gore. in tact, hethinks
the McGovern Camp mayhave stolen
its methods from him,

In April at last year Brock sug-,
gested applying the idea he hadused
for himself to the national cam-
paign. Nixon, he reports, was“very
excited” and gave the go-ahead.

Now the youth campaign tor Nixon

the east coast," Brock says

As strong on campus as all?

Brock says yes, sometimes stu-
dents go to the McGovern voter re—
gislration table only to turn away
and come to the Republican one,

“I think it breaks down more by
region than by type, We have found
that the young voter is intluencedby
the whole community, including the
campus but not just the campus.
Faculty are the most important
single iniluence. Except in high
school, there it’s parents and Peer
groups, . says Brock ofthecampuss

noncampus distinction.

Brock tries to schedule his talks
to student groupsto includeintormol
rap sessions where he can listen
as well as talk.

He has tound Nixon's biggest plus
is his conduct of toreign policy and
the economy. Approval ishighonthe
trips to Moscow and Peking and on
the regulation of the economy

The biggest minus: Watergate.

Brock, of Course, knows that he
is building himself a constituency.
He did not unseat the Silver Fox
at Tennessee by being stupid,

Whatever happens in November,
there will be a growing national
body at young voters who will re—
member who Bill Brock is,

What does he say, then to the al-
ready growing speculation that he
may be a youthrsupported altet'n:
ative to Spiro Agnew in 1976?

Well, all he will say is, “Every
freshman senator has a right to
dream,"

But he doesn’t have to [owe the
smile.
