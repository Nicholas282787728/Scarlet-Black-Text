Wall: Progress M Dean

by Ken Winokur
Dean Joseph Wall has been teach-
ing history at Grinnellfor 25 years.
Three and a half years ago he
assumed additional responsibility
by becoming Dean oi the College.
At the end of this semester he will
resign his position as Dean, and
resume teaching and doing historical
research full time.
Why oluntarilyleaveahimportant,

ous job as Dean, to return
to teaching? Simply because he ielt
that he could have “a more direct
effect on a Student’s education.”

tucky, and will be published by
Thomas Y. Crowell.

Although busy at his administrative
position, Wall has found time to
spend in the classroom His con-
tinuance in teaching seems to have
helped keep him abreast of the’cur—
rent situation at Grinnell. “There
have been a great many changes both
academic and social”.

independent study is one area that
Wall views as important. “I think
that we need to consider the whole
relation of independent study to the
regular coursework. The movement

Three year iellowships will be oitered tor study or work leading to

toward independent study has beena
healthy move, but has developed
without much planning or sense oi
direction.” Wall encourages some
iurther development in this area,
Another area that Dean Wall views
as important is that oi career plan-

Last year, while on a one semester
leave from Grinnell, Dean Wall
taught at Brown University in Free
vidence, Rhode Island. It was there
that he made the decision to resign
his position “My experience teach—
ing at Brown made me realize that

i wanted to get back into teaching
and doing research, When I took the
Job (as Dean) three and one half
years ago, i was pretty much ccn—
vinced that I didn't want to stay
in college administration for the
rest of my professional life. Since
the major curriculum changes I had
been particularly interested in what
had been adopted. I felt that I could
do more by teaching and doing rec
Search,”

The historical research that Dean
Wall refers to has led to the publi-
cation of three books, with a fourth
to come out soon. One ofthese books,
a biography entitled AndrewCarn-
egie, has received two literary
prizes: The BancroftPrizein Amer
ican history; and The Iowa Library
Prize for the best book written by
an Iowa author in 1971. His newbook
will be readings in Contemporary
American history, called Interpret-
ing Twentieth Century America.
This book was written with Profes—
Sor Richard Lowitt, professor of
History at the University of Ken»

ning and counselling. “I certainly
welcome the internal Study of our
college goals that President Leg-
gett has indicated in his talk to
the faculty this fall. One area we
have to be concerned With is ca—
reer planning and counselling.
Fewer students are going on to grade
uate school, and there is a growing
concern oi students about what you
do with a Bachelor’s degree,”

Dean Wall noted many other
changes since his initial exposure
to Grinnell as an undergraduate stu-
dent. Beside the obviuus physical
changes, like coeducational housing
and student body size, Wall men-
tioned "a great many changes in
curriculum", a younger faculty, and
a somewhat different student body.

“I think that the students are of
a higher quality. They are also
more liberal in their political and
social outlook. There is a greater
stress on academics, and less em—
phasis on formal socializing.”

Wall feels that students have had
tremendous impact on the direction
of education. He thinks that many
students “feel frustrated, but they
have made a positive effect,” He
Said that irom the college's begin—
ning, when Grinneil was an aboli—
tionist school, that the students and
faculty have been concerned with
"the social issues of the day”.

As Dean, as a teacher, and as a
researcher, Dean Wall has shown
a committment to education. It is
this committment that has allowed
him to move successiully irom one
end of education to another. It is
also this committment that has kept
him in step with progressive educa-

tion.
