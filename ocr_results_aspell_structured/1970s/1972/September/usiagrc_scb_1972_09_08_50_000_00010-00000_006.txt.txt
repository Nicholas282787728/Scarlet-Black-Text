Lettuce Boycott:
Issues And Background

A boycott oi lceberg lettuce is going to be
to be discussed at the Student Committee
meeting September 13 at 7:30 pm. in the
basement of ARH. A referendum on the
issue of the boycott will be considered;
a referendum to allow the students to ex-
press their opinions concerning the current
struggle to unionize migrant lettuce work—
ers in California.

At the present time, Saga is serving
“Teamster” picked lettuce. The United
Farm Workers have asked tor a boycott
of this lettuce and of nonunion lettuce.

The Background

Now, there probably wouldn’t be this
controversy 37 years later if the farm
laborers had been included under the pro
visions of the Labor Relations Act of 1957.
But, they weren’t. Farm laborers haven’t
had and still don’t have the Opportunity for
etiective collective bargaining.

As long as the larm workers were unable
to protect themselves with the provisions
of this law and at the same time were uni
able to protect themselves from strike
breakers all organizing efforts ended as
failures.

In 1967, under the leadership of Cesar
Chevez, the United Farm Workers emerged
at the forefront of a movement that had
been unsuccessful in the continental United
state {or 100 years.

In l9'10 the United Farm Workers peti-
tioned the huge lettuce industry or the Sali-
nas'valley of California for Secret ballot
representational elections. It was a drama-
tic, clear Cut strike at the most powerful
concerns in agriculture.

If the UFW could unionize the lettuce work-
ers, none of the big agribusinesses could
take the movement lightly. lT’l‘, Grey-
hound, Tenneco~~(which controls land in
California and Arizona twice the size of
Rhode Island), and Standard Oil, to name
just a few or the big agribusinesses, might
easily be forced to sign UFW contracts
someday.

But the lettuce growers returned the let-
ters of the United Farm Workers unopened
and went to the Teamsters looking for help,
The Teamsters and the growers signed con~
tracts, which, the teamsters later admitted.
were signed to protect Teamster jobs rrom
strike disruption. ‘

Deprived Of representational elections, the
UFW called a strike against the growers
including the ones with Teamster contracts.
And, on August 24, 1970, 7,000 workers
walked out.

With production cut by Sixty six percent -
by the growers own figures (as reported
in the Washington Post), {our major firms
rescinded thEir contracts with the Team~
sters and signed contracts with the UFWr

On March 26, 1971, the Teamsters coune
tersigned an agreement with the UFW
agreeing to honor the urw‘s right to or—
ganize the fields and to withdraw from
the lettuce fields. This pressure, in March
1971 brought the growers to the UFW bar-
gaining table

The UFW contracts that were won provide
tor the agribusinesses to rerorm their prac-
tices across the board, changing every as-
pect ot the lives of the migrant workers
pect oi the lives of the migrant workers -
something the Teamsters’ contracts did not
even attempt.

In UFW contracts the agribusinesses are
required to contribute 109‘ for each hour
worked to the Robert F. Kennedy Medical
Plan. In addition, the Contracts require
the companies to consult with the Union's
Health and Satety Committee iniprmingpo-
licies relating to pesticides, equipment and
all other aspects of the Work which might
effect the health or safety of the Workers.

The contracts further provide thatthe com-
panies must furnish, pay for. and maintain
adequate toilet iacilities, drinking water,
two [0 minute rest periods a day, first-
aid supplies, cholinesterase tests iorwork»
ers employed as applicators when organo»
phosphates are used, and the elimination of
various economic poisons. Finally, no
discrimination by sex is to be allowed.
These are revolutionary demands for farm
labor. The United Farm Workers need to
ask for these things because farm workers
suﬂer from numerous hazards and hard—
ships,

The following facts compiled, from sta~
tistics of various government agencies
illustrate the problem well.

“The life expectancy for migrants is 49
years.”

“Approximately 375,000 children between
the ages of 10 and la pertorm larm labor.
The most common reason {ortheir employ
ment is the low wages paid to the iamily
hreadwinner, which are not sufﬁcient to
meet the minimum family expenses,"

“Children who engage in such arduous
labor become undernourished and under-
sized.“

The Salud Medical Clinic in California’s
Tularc County found in a recent survey
that eighty percent or 774 iarm workers

interviewed suffered pesticide poison—
ing symptoms,

A California Health Department survey in
1969 revealed at least 150 Cases per 1000
workers had pesticide poisoning.

The average per capita health care ex-
penditure in 1967 for migrant was $7.50
The average health care expenditure in
1957 tor the total population was $200.

Fortunately, the situation here at Grinnell
on which the students are probably going
to be asked to vote on is much simpler
one than the history of farm labor organi-
zing. Jerry Ramaker told the SitB that
any decision on what type of lettuce is to
be served is up to the students
The United Farm Workers are trying
to change the lives or thousands oi Ameri-
cans locked into a vicious cycle oi poverty,
disease and exploitation. The message the
union is voicing is political as well as
economic. The UFW already has a medi-
cal clinic opened at the UFW retreat cen»
ter in Delano, Thirteen service centers
are operating.

Corretta King, holding the same ideals of
nonviolence as her late husband and of the
United Farm Workers, has pledged the
Center for Nonviolence for the use of the
boycott. The Urw is trying to get pledges
of support in thirty metropolitan cen-
ters,

This is a movement that is encompassing
the nation, and it encompasses it in more
ways than one. it successiul, their or-
ganizing will eiiect allAmericans bybring-
ing a large segement of our population into
the twentieth Century.

The UFW is only the latest in a long
string at unions altering help. The let-
tuce fields of California are only the lat»
est testing ground for an American dream
that has {aileduat least for one segement
of the population. Farmlahorers are among
the most poorly paid and underprivileged
people in America,

They are looking for friends throughout
the nation to help them earn What they
think are a lewpbasic rights--the right
to organize, the right to decent wages and
working conditions, and the right to a dig
nitied life style. to a decent education,
and to decent health care.

They ask [or the right to be free from
hunger and poverty Perhaps, students at
Grinnell will get to help judge this move
ment themselves, individually, and perhaps
they will judge it differently than I ah,
viously have.
