Sports, the pope and other profundities

Before I commence to discuss more
trivial matters, such as the pope com-
ing to Iowa, I would like to make
amends to all those wouldrbe sports
readers whom the 5&3 has most
notoriously abused. I, too, was shock-
ed, appalled, and disgusted by the
lack of sports news in the third issue
of the shin. I ask you, what are three
people fiddling around compared with
the aesthetics, grace, and competition
of a field hockey or volleyball game?
(Remember it s not if we win Or lose,
it s how we play it up afterwards.) So
this week, regardless of what the 5&8
staff plan's for lay ou,t l m at least
devoting part of my column to. . .

SPORTS NEWS

Monday marked a big day for the
“Racquetball Rahsl" as mixed
doubles team Reese and Miller won
their first game in four years, wiﬂl a
final score of 2173. Asked how they
managed to win by such a wide
margin, Reese replied, ”Our biggest
strategy was to call out the score in
French and Chinese. That way our
opponents Were intimidated by our
language abilities and they never
could figure out they were behind."
Miller added that the fact the opposi-
tion never showed, thereby forfeiting
the game, was also in their favor.

about these things without getting
emotional.) In addition, it is the first
time EVER a pope will venture out-
side of New York City, cross the ma»
jestic Mississippi, and get to the heart
of this great nation,

Needless to say, it will be billed as
the biggest event ever to occur in Des
Moines. Iowa. (Des Moines has been
waiting patienuy for any event to oc—
cur for a long time.) The city is
beside itself in anticipation, and is
completely preoccupied in making
sure this blessing for the “Big Apple
of the Midwest” goes off smoothly.

The illustrious local papers are do—
ing their hit by ﬂooding their pages
with such social concerns as the
widowed, aged, homeless, and hungry,

Department stores are offering pins,
pendants, t-shirts of “the skiing
pope," mugs, and commemorative
portraits of Pope John Paul Ill

Fearful of blundering in front of the
pope, me people of the “Surprising
Place" are diliggitly researching
Vanderbilt and Post‘for proper papal
etiquette. Some major concerns:
Does one genuflect in front of the
pope? What is the status of ring kiss-
ing? What is the proper pronoun
(your, ours, his, mine) to preface
”Holiness" in addressing the pope?

“If you think lie goes home
and listens to tile ‘Dead,’

you can think again.”

Now, on to less pertinent mat-
ters ..... The pope’s upcoming visit to
Iowa will have monumental impact
not only on Iowa and Des Molnes, but
also Grinnell. Because the vast
significance of this historic visit will
be incomprehensible to many Grin-
nellians, I, a proud, native lowan,
would like to digress and consider for
a moment: I) the extensive prepara-
tion on the part of Iowa for such a
divine visit, 2) how this papal visit will
affect cloistered, impotent, humorless
Grinnellians, a) what the pope has to
do with the absence of a sports page in
the 5&3. 4) how the pope relates to
disco, and other such
"historydnrthermaking” topics. I
shall get to these and other concerns
presently,

First, the facts: The October 4
papal visit marks only the second trip
by a pope to the United States in the
history of the world since God created
heaven and earth! (Sorry, I can’t talk

September 28, 1979

Everyone is extending warmest
welcomes to the pope in the form of
billboards, classified ads, amend-
mean to “Garage Sale” signsI and
painted mailboxes, Traditionally,
commercial competitors such as Tasty
Taco, Taco John, Taco Casa, Taco
Bell, and El Banditoes, are col-
laborating to mark this historic event.
Their efforts include specially printed
styrofoam cups and wax paper
packaging greeting the pope in four
languages. (They hope nobody calls
their bluff on the Polish.) A small
“Litterus Non” graces Hie containers.

One of the most problematic worries
that faces the Des Moines Catholic
Diocese, at least , is what to do with
all of Iowa’s liberated women during
the papal visit. Doubtless, they'll
want to be right up there in front, just
like everyone else. when therpope
comes. It's especially embarrassing
to push back all those women who
have, for the last several years, so

aptly aided in serving the Eucharist
and in reading scripture during mass.

I’ve heard rumors that a pep rally is
being planned, just prior to the pope’s
arrival, for all those consciousness» .
raised Catholic women. They will be
kindly asked to give up their _
legitimate functions, and positions,
(“just this once girls") and don pro—
per veils and attire Meanwhile, the
bishop and priests will be praying
fervently for good behavior.

1 bet you're saying to yourself, lay
oif Des Moines already and tell us how
the pope affects us cloistered, impty
tent, and humorless Grinnellians.
Well, the best way to do that is to tell
you what the pope has to do with the
absence of a sports page and how “His
Excellency" relates to disco.
Because, by all appearances, these
are the only issues plaguing Grinnell
students today

About sports. well, you and I know
Hie pope is all for them. He skiis, he
skates, and he enjoys a good
“football” game every now and then.
But everything has its place. Just as
the pope doesn t ski before mass, . _
neither should Grinnell be so preoc-
cupied with the profanities of a game
on the dawn of an historic papal v'uit.
The issue focused on the Mirecourt.‘ .
Trio. “Rather to solicit music from
the spheres," right? (By the way,
that's Shakespeare )

As for the discophohe discophile con-
troversy, we can assure ourselves that
the pope sympathizes with the ’philés.
what else do you think the pope does
apresski’l if you think he goes home
and listens to the “Dead, " you can
think again. .

One more thing, according to Da ‘
Blatt, the pope personally granted ails
dience to Jacques Morali,
(producer-director of the Village Peo-
ple) and absolved him of his mortal
sins, thus assuring him safe passage

to heaven.
