ll McKee returns from conference

with Dober; planners study space

By Patti Hahn

Christopher McKee. Librarian of
the College. returned last Thurs:
day from Cambridge, Massachu-
setts, Where he met with architects
of ﬂ’le Dober and Associates firm to
discuss the ”reblocking of Space”
needed in Burling Library,

McKee also spent a day in
Minneapolis to meet with the ar-
chitectural firm of Michaud,
Cooley, Hallberg, Erickson and
Associates about other structural
problems that plague the library.

THE increasing dilemma of
insufficient stack space has caused
McKee and others to look for
altemativu to the existing library
situation. Among the possibilities
being considered is a
reclassification project, an ex
tension of the mezzanine level, a
organization of the current floor
plan, knocking out walls in the
basement level. and a conversion
from the large study tables to
individual Carrels or “study»
stations.” McKee refused to

speculate on the possible costs of
the renovation.

A goal has been set to develop
stack space for 400,000 volumes,
which would provide adequate
space until 1997, with ap-
proximately 9,000 books added
each year. McKee does not expect
any large external changes on the
library, however.

A preliminary sketch of existing
space has been drawn up, which
the library staff, The Library
Committee, and the President of
the College will all review before
further action is taken. Richard
Souza, a structural engineer of the
Dober firm, will visit Grinnell next
week and form a final opinion as to
the space condition of Burling.
Mechanical engineer Robert
Erickson, 0f the MichaudMCooley,
Hallberg, Erickson and Associates
firm will also be here next week to
look into the additional difficulties
of inadequate heating and air»
conditioning, the inefficient use of
energY, insulation. the lighting

system and noise control. McKee
predicts that approximately five-
eighths of any change made to
Burling will be of the mechanical
nature.
Cambridge on October 3 for a two-
day work session to re-evaluate the
suggested layouts, which will then
be the basis for final drawings.
McKee commented that the
changes planned for Burling must
get underwayin the near future. ”I
think that it's clear we really have
at best only four to five years for
additional collection growth in
Burling library. That, in fact, is the
most optimistic prediction. I could
see us running out of space in four
years. As far as the other features
of the building are concerned, the
need for a quieter. more congenial
study area is immediate. Given
these time considerations, its
obvious that since the work will
have to be carried out in a series of
stages, construction ought to get
under way within the next 24
months,” he said,

yield. Why? Because we are in a
financial struggle ourselves. The
name of the game is maximum
access for students, lowest charges
that are possible, most financial
aid that is possible, etc."

Turner added that “it would
further be said that colleges have
in the past and Will continue to
produce precisely the sorts of
people that will enter those com-
panies and hopefully become the
executives, the lawyers and so
forth who can work constructive
change. Our most constructive
way to produce effective change
may have a lag factor in it."

TURNER also cited another
argument against divestiture, this
time not only moral, but also
possibly legal: “Very often when
money is given to (the College),
this is precisely with the
stipulation that it be invested for
maximum return."

Turner sees proxy as a viable
alternative to divestiture. If
stockholders disapproval is made
public, the corporations will feel
the heat. “They’ll movt%however
little, however cautiously, towards
a more responsible position.”
Divestiture of blue chip stock,
rather than allowing for the at
tempt at corporation reform
through the pressure of
stockholders proxy voting, would
divorce responsible people and
organizations from a viable
method of voicing complaint.
Turner states, ”If we Sell 20,000
shares of something, someone else
will pick it up and no one will know
the difference.”

THE PRESIDENT ended his
statements on investment policy on
a correspondingly temperate tone.
He stated that you have to weigh
what you can do to reform the
government “over and against
what you do to the economy and the
people who are actually living,
loving, buying” in that area.
“That's where I think you have to
he very careful about the super-
liberal positioniparticularly the
far-removed,” he stated.

As well as considering inr
vestment policy, Turner discussed
the school’s energy problems.

WITH increasing fuel costs, as

Correction: In last week’s article
concerning the SGA budget, it was
stated that the assistant student
coordinator would get a $75 raise.
The article should have Said that
all three assistant student coor-
dinators would each get a $25 raise.

 

well as environmental con
siderations, Grinnell College is
giving high priority to energy
concerns. Window replacement,
apparently conserving significant
amounts of heat, will continue, All
new plans for renovation (of
Burling, the dormitories) will give
high priority to energy con
servation.

TURNER believes that the
Energy Committee is important to
the College’s energy use policy,
adding, “That’s something we
have to really get on. I was
disappointed that more didn’t
happen last year.” Personally, he
believes that a heightened energy
awareness campaign should be
encouraged. He thinks simple
“messages on the light switches"
would save a lot of energy. In
addition, he suggests that a
building’s lights could be shutoff at
least partially during “slow" hours
of the day, rather than in-
conveniencing numerous people by
simply shutting down entire
buildings several hours earlier at
night.

Concerning the White Paper,

 

Turner noted that in the confusion
of last fall’s reorganization, the
Paper received negative reactions.
However, he added that this was
true “probably not by virtue of the
content (of me Paper) so much as
of the climate of the Whole fall."

“The one thing that the White
Paper really flushed out~out of
the alumni, out of the faculty, and,
I think, out of the student b0dy~
was we really want to stay on a
Very conservative~in the best
sense of the word—course. We are
a liberal arts college. That has
been our strength. That’s the
strength of the people who are
here,“

“THAT‘S viable," Turner con-
tinued, “that's What we want to
carry into the future. And I think
people would go so far as to
say that that may really be a fairly
brave posture when the temptation
is to get kinky, to go vocational, to
have very contemporary programs
and that sort of thing. Everybody.
just with a few minority voices
here and there, is saying, ‘No
way!’ We really want to stay on a
liberal arts course."
