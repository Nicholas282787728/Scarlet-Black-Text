Stereo typing typists

This summer I endured,
hopeiully lor the last time, the
spirited life oi a secretary for the
us. government. oi course, ii 1
had a column last fall, my opening

,sentence might have been the
Same The lure oi security, cons
[acts for the future, and money (l)
drew me into the seat behind the
t'pewriter and in front of the boss'

Ce once again.

I assumed that the non
lieberated <1 cringe at the word
sexist because of it accusing

,urc) attitude that prevailed
around me was caused by my job.
Secretaries, stereotypically. not
only type, file, and do the letch
work, they also have to be a main
object of the olfice beautification
program. But exchanges with
other Grinnell women revealed
that perhaps not only secretaries
are subject to a narrow deﬁnition
of the abilities of women.

-\'F‘amily counselors, bank tellers,
and swim team Coaches all seem to
encounter a different attitude [mm
the one that we are accustomed to

. t Grinnell. Here, women can

rrect a male who uses chairman
instead of chairperson. Outside of
Grinnell, a woman might get less

work and more attention it her
skirt is short

Itis easy to exaggerate the sexist
attitudes oi the majority of the
population. Not all lellow ems
ployees ask you when you are
getting married and giving up your
silly ideas of law school. That kind
at conirontation is rather easy to
deal with. The subtle statements of
people are the more irustrating
aspects of being around non-
liberated individuals

For example, I naively assumed

édndcr

that hiring would now be iree irom
bias for white males. I witnessed
my boss interview three males ior
every one female even though the
number oi applications and the
qualiﬁcations [or the two sexes
were comparable. The result was a
stall oi males with the typical
token proiessional woman. Also,
the only upperrlevel iemale staff
person (i.e. boss) was assigned to
the Oliice Designing Task Force
while the males held seats on the
more substantive Committees.

Perhaps I new sound rather
idealistic to the reader; my
sheltered life at Grinnell has lead
me to expect more liberal attitudes
outside oi the campus. But after
ten torceiul years of a movement
that has never lost its momentum
lalthough it has changed direction
many times), I would hope that
ideals would stop being platitudes
and would become reality in other
than liberal colleges,

The ideals that l speak oi are not
only that Women feel liberated and
know their own body, but that they
are able to get equal consideration
ior iobs.and equal treatment and
pay for the labor.

Women, perhaps after or during
their examination of what it means
to be a woman, must be aware of
the political meaning of feminism,
Others attitudes will Change only if
women assert their rights in the
social and political arena,

In the future it will not be enough
to leel lree or stereotypes oi the
iemale ii society is still coniining
you. Perhaps this is a call to action
alter experiencing the conlines.
But I learned that I will press [or
others to see me as an equal, as I
see myself,

What It Might Have Looked Like

Nothing to do

by PanlStcinbrecliei'

One of the most oiten uttered
laments on campus these days is
the eternal “But there’s absolutely
nothing to clot” Perhaps it is time
ior everyone, especially the new
ireshman class, to realize that the
chieisocial survival technique on a
small lowa college campus is not to
wait for things to happen, but
rather to take an initiative interest.
Alter all, the science uiiding and
library only have ii [9 joy and

at involved—join Circle K!

Two weeks of the college year
has passed. The novelty oi
returning to or starting college
should have faded away. Quizzes,
papers, and researching in the
library will soon have become a
monotonous ritual oi our college
experience.

However, right on this campus
an organization by the name at
Circle K oiiers an opportunity to
break away irom this monotony It
olicrs an opportunity ior “con-
cerned” students to become
“INVOLVED" in community and
campus service. Through Circle K
you can become “Involved" In
Action [or the Youth and Elderly.
Public Health, Consumer

Protection and Social Priorities.

Circle K is the “People
Organization."

The People Organization,
because the world is people.
Because the only real problems are
people problems As an
organization we hope to begin
working on these problems,

What is circle Kl

Well, its the largest college
service organization in North
America, It is also a group of in-
dlviduals who are concerned about
others We are so concerned that
we are willing to spend at least an
hour a week at a Day Care Center,
or visiting an elderly person at the
Mayllowcr Home or Just rciidci-ing

service ' wherever it is needed.
Circle K members believe that
through “personal service” on
campus and in the community we
can help others and in so doing,
build our own character.
