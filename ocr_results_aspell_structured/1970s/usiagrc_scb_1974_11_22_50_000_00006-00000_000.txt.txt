Catching up with American Review

respectively. sins each.

For those unfamiliar with
American Review, let me briefly
introduce it. This is a magazine of
new writing, that is published in
book IDrm. ‘It comes out three
times a year. Each issue contains
what is probably the best in
current literature. not current in
its loose usage, but current in all is
immediacy. offering the reader a
wide and vaired cross section of
world, though mostly Western.
poetry, prose and analysis.

Skip Poetry

AR 20 contains an amalgam oi
material, the least notable, in my
opinion, is the poetry. The two
works that most impressed me
were EL. Doctorow's nngtimc
and Peter Handke’s ll Sorrow
Beyond Dreams. Both or these
stories are masterpieces. Doe
torow's is taken trom a Torr
ihcomming novel, as is his The
Pyramid Club in AK 21, Both stand

on their own.
Freud. White. Houdil .

Doctorow’s Ragtime is one or
the best pieces of irony and satire
that I've read in a long time. The
story obscurely deals with the
early years or this century, though
avoids concentrating on any one
event or person. The closest
associations we have are Freud on
his ﬁrst and only visit to the States,
Stanford White (the architect).
Houdini, and the upper and lower
classes of New York.

Calculated Ulidcrstatenicnt

The satire of the times is
hilarious and the irony more than
painlul, Doctorow has that
precious gift at calculated unr
derstatement that, at the Same
time. makes you laugh and yet
wonder why you are laughing. He
makes you question what you're
really laughing at.

I would, it possible, quote the
whole story but that is impossible.
Rather, some of the better parts
are: “Across America sex and
death were barely distinguishable

not auspicious. A row protessional
alienists understood his imv
portance, but to most of the public
he appeared as some German
sexologist, an exponent of tree
love who used big words to talk
about dirty things. At least a
decade would have to pass beiore
Freud would have his revenge and
seehis ideas begin to destroy sex in

the shoolrthe-chutes and Freud and
Jung took a boat together through
the Tunnel or Love. The day came
to a close when Freud tired and
had one of the fainting (its that had
lately plagued him when in Jung’s
presence (to), (And tinally alter
Freud's return from America , . .)
He (Freud) said to Ernest Jones,
America is a mistake, a gigantic
mistake (18). " And so on, until it
hurts, really hurts.
Dross

Between Doctorow's and Han-
dke's pieces are 120 pages at dross.
But the finale is worth the price of
admission.

Recognized

Handke is just beginning to be
recognized in the United States. He
is already a major literary ﬁgure
in Europe. His play Kaspar is
considered a masterpiece or the
modern theater, (This is what the

better literary journals relate as A
Sorrow Beyond orcamsis the tirst,
but surely not the last, work by
Handke that I have read.) Soon I
hope to do a major work or his on
these pages.
Mother's Suicide

i\Sorrow neyonrl Dreams is the
story or the process of a mother’s
road to suicide as related by her
son, a writer. The style is cold,
hard, and straightforward. All
sentimentality is rejected either as
a given at the outset or in the
process at the telling.

The broad parallels the story
suggests should not be the subject
of only a Iew lines. so I shall avoid
any type oi analysis. Rather, all i
can do is urge a reading or this
remarkable story—remarkable
not only for the content and its bold
presentation, but also tor the
brilliant manner in which We are
presented with the tale. First we
begin to notice the mother can
sumed certain thoughts and ideas,
then the son, while telling the
story, and then ourselves, in
reading it,

rm the one person who have been
experiencing it. I've been U.S.A.
for 750 days. I came from Korea,
and rd spent part or llth and 12th
grades of high school in Hawaii.
then I came here.

My everyday’s life in here has
been a process or learninge

started to realize one thing: “the
World should know each other
more than now.” Every action is
carried out based on un-
derstanding, but understanding
can’t be without knowledge, This
world should know each other
more for more understanding. It’s
amazing that there are so many

without understanding. All we
know about each other are the
history or wars. History or humans
seems to be a history of war. What
have we learned about the other
country in school? For example,
what is the first thing to come up in
your mind when you hear the word
Korea? Maybe Korean War. I’ve
believed that I knew a lot about
U.S.A., but I couldn't answer Well
when I asked mysell a question.
“What do you know about U.S.A.7"*

this country, U.S.A.. now.

i really want to have a chance to
understand others, and I guess
there are lots oi others like me in
Grinnell. We better share our
knowledge and understand each
other more. I’m t ’ king of three
activities as possibilities tor next
semester: 1) Korean language
class in not only language, but also
a bit of culture; 2) weekly ethnic.
activities with cooking, games,
songs, etc; (using 20 foreign
students here), and 3) open
discussion.

Anybody agrees with my
thoughts or interested in these
activities or have any other ideas,
leave me a note (Box 435).
