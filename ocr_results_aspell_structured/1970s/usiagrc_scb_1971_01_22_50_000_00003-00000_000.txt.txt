Elton’s Second Album Even Better

by Ron Medvin

i971 has started out with a
roar in the rock music world,
with the release of Elton
John’s secondalbum,’1‘umbler
weed Connection. Back inSep-
tember, I said that Elton John
would be the next rock super-
star, and it seems like he has
achieved this distinction even
faster than I thought. His cone
certs in Fillmore East were
all sold out; even Bob Dylan
went to see Elton twice!
“Your Song" has become a
giant hit on AM radio’s top 40.
Elton John is now at the top,
where he belongs.

His second albumis different
from the firstin one important
way. Unlike the first, the or
chestration is absent. This
album lets the listener hear
Elton John's superb work on
the keyboards, both piano and
organ. "Talking Old Solde
iers", in fact, has Eltonplay-
ing alone, and the song is
hauntingly pOWerful. "Burn
down the Mission" is probably
the best song on the album,
and it definitely has the poten*
tial of becoming one of the
year's best songs. Elton
writes all of his own music,
and it is all excellent. His
lyricist Bernie Taupin has
improved considerably from
the first album. The lyrics
are not as stiff nor as affec-
ted as some of his songs on
the first album. And Paul
Buckmaster is fast becoming
one of the best arrangers in
the musicworld. He has wisely
left out the orchestra which
covered much of Elton John's
genius in the first album.
There is no doubt that Elton

John has proven himself; he
needs no orchestra for sup-
port. His voice is bothpower-
ful and beautiful. When he
sings a song like “Country
Comfort" (a song he wrote
for Rod Stewart) the listener
(2n hear the strong excite-
ment which Elton John geners
ates. He also can singa soft
love song, such as “Love
Song", written by Lesley Dun-
mn. (This is the only song in
the album not composed by
Elton John, and Lesley does a
fine job as a backup singer
on her song.) "Amoreena"
and ”Where to now St. Peter"
are two songs similar to
"Your Song," and they are
both incredibly beautiful
songs.

The year is still young, but
this Will be onealbum thatwill
be hard to top. (Hopefully, this

year will be an ”awakening"
from most of last year's dis-
asters in the music world.)
Starting next week, this col-
umn will officially become a
"column," known as ”The
Rock Garden". (Sound like
that show on KDIC Friday
afternoons? How about that!)
Anyway, there are some EX’
cellent albums to be reviewed,
as 1971 really is starting off
well. The first "official" cols
umn will review Jesus Christ:
Superstar which was released
a few months backbutwhichis
just beginning to catch every
one's attention. (Listen for the
complete rock opera today,
Friday the 22nd, on "The Rock
Garden", startingatdnlu P.M.
on KDIC.) Meanwhile, stay
tuned (7) for LutherAllison on
January 30th. More on Allis

Quening the exhibit at the
National Gallery of Art, Dir-
ector J. (hrter Brown smted,
"When Apollo ll left the earth
in July, l969,toachieve man’s
first landing on another
heavenly body, the world
watched through the medium
of television. At Cape Kennedy
was a group of artists who
interpreted the historic event
in their own ways. Artists
were at Houston in the control
room for the landing on the
moon and on the carrier in
the Pa cific for the splashdovm.
Thus, we have a record for
the future ofsome of the great
est moments. of the present
through a medium that is as
old"a‘s our recorded past --
the intimate, human medium
‘of the artist's eye and hand.”

Artists have been invited to
Cape Kennedy and otherNASA
sites for seven years to re
cord in whatever way they see
fit America’s early steps into
space. The artists have been
chosen from a wide spectrum
of the art community to include
varied styles from the tradi»
tional to innovative work such
as Robert Rauschenberg.

THE
GRINNEll

HERALD-
REGISTER

 

President Glenn Leggett is
tentatively planning to leave
in early February fora two-
month leave of absence, de~
pending on the health of his
wife.

Leggett plans to visit Whit-
man College, a financially
successful institution, and
Reed College, which is going
bankrupt, to see how they have
handled their finances. He will
then visit New Zealand and
Australia and travel to Kenya
to spend about a month with
his oldest daughter and her
husband, who is an instructor
at the University of Nairobi.
He will return to Grinnell via
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Leggett's leave of absence
was made possible by a grant
from the Danforth Foundation.

Keeble Writes
Crab Canon

John Kceble, Grinnell
English instructor, is the
author of "Crab Canon,"pub'
lished in December by Gross
man Publishers of New York.
The 320*page novel concerns
the dilemma of David
Roschenstein‘s shattered
parentage and his struggle to
resolve it. The story is told
by eleven people who surround
the main character. He and
the others find themselves
drawn to Lagoon, Wyoming’s
Pentagonal Valley, where the
inscrutable machine, the giant
crab, looks over them.

The work is described by its
publisher as ”a modemwesr
em, a catalog of grotesques,
an engrossing quest novel, a
technically brilliant and
deeply moving first novel.
'Crab Canon' is for anyone
who loves the West (old or
new), who loves modern
fiction, who loves terrific
writing." Excerpts from the
book appeared earlier in the
magazine ”Confluence" and
in last year's Grinnell College
literary publication.

Keeble is currently working
on a bibliography of James
Joyce with David Hayman of
the University of Iowa.

determination and plentv of

South Dakota. Prof. John
Crossett could enlightenusall

assorted other topics. Zalman
King (Grinnell '63), noted TV
star of "The Young Lawyers"
could talk about the problems
in American jurisprudence
and how to tell Lee J. Cobbhe
is a great man.

But perhaps the most well-
informed and best qualified
speaker we could have is a
person who has spent half his
life concerned over what is
happening at Grinnell, its
dorms, its problems. He is a
person who is universally
liked, and attracts attention
wherever he goes on campus,
and is unafraid to speak his
mind at any time on any
subject. I therefore propose
Caine Tederman as a com-
mencement speaker, provided
he takes his football helmet
off first.
