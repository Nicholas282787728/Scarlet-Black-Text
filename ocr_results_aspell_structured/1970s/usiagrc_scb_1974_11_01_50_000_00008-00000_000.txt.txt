It will be the kind of game that
Grinnel] College belongs in,
against a school of the same
variety. Tomorrow's first-ever
encounter between Grinnell and
the University of Chicago should
also be Grinnell's second football
win of the season,

Grinnell goes into tomorrow‘s
game trying to rebound from a 27,

Ripon over break. The Belit loss
Ripon over break. The Beloit loss,
points scored against Ripon can be
considered a good sign against a
team as per‘enially powerful as the
Redmen from Wisconsin.

A 403-yard offensive effort
against Ripon couldn’t stop the
hosts as they dropped Grinnell to a
1-5 conference record and a i-S'
mark overall. “We played well
enough on offense to win, but not
well enough on defense," said
Coach Edd Bowers. “We moved

Injuries, murky weather, and a

somewhat for both players and
fans. Senior Co-Captain Sandy
Rikoon sat it out with a painful
sprained ankle, and regular
fullback Mark Schwartz never
made it to the game from his

squad is enthusiastically racking
them up. No previous Pioneer
soccer team has won

team can lose only two), swept all
its home games, won five in a row,
or achieved two shutouts in one
Season. III addition, Grinllell has
scored more and yielded less than
any other team [0 date. And if the
Pioneeers win tomorrow they will
clin h a share of the Southern
div 'on title, another first.

As for Gl‘iiincll's shot at a Conr
ference title, itnppears slim. Even
by beating Cornell tomorrow. no
automatic prospect, the Pioneers
will likely find themselves tied
with arch ival Knox. If both teams
sport 771 records, the squad with
the higher ratio of goals scored to
goals yielded will move on to the
conference title bout, to be held
November 9 on the field of the
Southern champion.

Entering the final week, Knox
holds a strong lead in this depart-
ment with a 2&7 scoring edge,
compared to the Pioneer 2179
mark.
