MAC Sanctions Monmouth

by Dave Schechter

CEDAR RAPIDS, IAr-As a result
of alleged recruiting and financial
aid violations in their basketball
and football programs, Monmouth
College has been suspended by the
Midwest Athletic Conference from
league play in these two sports
tor two years, beginning with the
1974-75 season. The action was
taken by the faculty representatives
to the conference atthcleague meet—
ing at Coe College, on Nov. l'lrlxt
In other action the application of
Lake Forest (IL) to join the MAC
was approved and returned to the
member schools for ratificationwi-
thin sixty days. On the basis of
a preliminary vote Lake Forest
will join the MAC next year,
The faculty statement said, “The
conference takes this action becau-
se of its finding, aiter extensive
discussion, that the athletic pro»
gram of Monmouth in two sports
(football and basketball) has been
inconsistent with the spirit and pr—
actice of the Midwest Conference.”
The vote on the sanction was 8»0‘
2 with Monmouth and St. Olaf, wh»
ich is leaving the conference this
year, abstaining.

The suspension against Monmouth
provides for the "loss of confer
ence standing" for the 1974-75 and
1975776 athletic seasons. Thesanc-
tions are to be reviewed at the
end at the two year period. Mons
mouth may schedule games with
MAC schools if the schools wish,
and they are still in full standing
in all other sports.

Several incidents concerning the
Monmouth football coach, including
a threatened lawsuit against the
conference by an ineligible Monr
mouth football player, were included
in the list or particulars against
Monmouth, to be released later.
There had been questions asked
about Monmouth's practice of aw-
arding $500 no-need academic schr
olarships, an early admissions date,
and the awarding of other scholars
ships.

Grinnell lost to Monmouth 50—0
in football this year in a game
marred by racial insults. In soc,
cer, Grinnell was the alleged vic-
tim of rough play by the Monmouth
hooters. The Illinois school has
suffered a decreasing enrollment
and allegedly relaxed admissions
standards which some felt have
compromised their academic stan~
dards. It was felt that the emphar
sis on athletics at Monmouth had
gotten out of hand.

Chuck Jepsen, Grinnell faculty
representative, wouldn’t elaborate
on the charges against Monmouth.
lie expressed dismay at the fact
that the sanction received as much
publicity as it did.

Athletic Director John A. Pfitsch
announced that Grinnell will not
schedule Monmouth in football and
basketball during the next two
years. He commented, "the pro—
grams of emphasis at Monmouth
has an extreme in it at this point.
They have been here in the league
for years and they haven't been
that way, and its just a recent
thing, in the last three or four
years. The feeling was that this
penalty was a penalty that should
be invoked.”

Richard D. stine, president ofMon-
mouth said, “While the college re»
cognized the seriousness of this
judgement, it is grateful that the
conference has provided the oppor»
tunity for necessary adjustment."
Jepsen commented further that
alone none of the charges were
extremely damaging, but that ad-
ded together over the period of
several years, the sanction was
the best action that could be taken.
Pfitsch Concluded that it was nice
having Lake Forest in the MAC,
said that the Monmouth situation
as it evolved, was sad and he
hoped the trend of oversemphasis
on athletics across the country co—
uld be turned around and that purely
amateur athletics could experience
a resurgence of growth.

Bakery Schedule For late Night Runs

by ken Winokur

Ah, those warm Bismarks (jelly
doughnuts to the ignorant) There
is nothing like a fresh Danish to
get those juices ﬂowing for that
all»nighter. It is not news that
Grinnellians make late night trips
to the bakery, but how many know
exactly what they are getting? in
this time of consumer education
and information, why is it that
everyone is still in a muddle about
when to get the cookies fresh out
of Hansen’s ovens?

Many people seem to think that
2:00-2:30 a.m. daily is the prime
time to visit the bakery. This is,
of course, when the basic seler
ction of doughnuts is first fin-
ished. But, that is just the tip of
the iceberg. Hate night people and
earlyrbirds should be aware that

Roy, Governors Hear Nixon

by Steven Nunn
Scarlet ind Black specili currtmoatit

MEMPHIS, TNs—The nation’s Re-
publican governors assembled for
their winter meeting here. Fifteen
of the eighteen GOP chief execu—
tives attended the meeting, where
they toured the local Schlitz brew-
ery, listened to country music star
Johnny Cash - and saw president
Nixon as he pursued “Operation
Candor,”

The meeting with Nixon, accord—
ing to lowa Governor Robert Ray,
produced little new information
other than some financial details
on San Clemente which the Presi-
dent revealed in response toaques»
tion from Missouri governorChris-
topher Bond.

Nixon told Bond that all governs
ment expenditures on his property
were for security reasons and that
the heating system was replaced,
at a cost of $60,000, because it
was gas-operated and the Secret
Service thought this was less safe
than an electric system.

The government did not pay for
heating Nixon's swimming pool, as
ocording to Bond, since there is
no heat in the swimming pool
Questions about the length of Nix-
on’s tenure in office arose, and he
was quoted by Tennessee's Win~
field Dunn as saying he was “not
going to walk away” from the job.
Nixon also told the governors that,

if there were any new Watergate

“bombshells” waiting in the wings,
he did not know about it.

(it was less than 24 hours later
that the White House revealed that
an 18 minute segment of one of
the suppeonaed Watergate tapes had
been obliterated by a strange tone.

Later, the white House admltted
that the President was aware of
the tape problem when he gave his
“no more bombshells" assurance
to the governors.)

According to Ray, almost the en~
tire discussion between the Presi—
dent and the state executives was
devoted to Watergate and topics such
as energy and the economy were
not much touched on.

On the first day of the conference,

0 the governors heard from a panel

consisting of George Gallup of the
Gallup Poll and Irving kristol, a
former editor of Commentary mag»
azine who now is a protessor at
New York University.

Nixon was apparently impressed
that Kristal had come to the con»
ference, reportedly remarking to
Gov. Dunn, “Like all great writers,
he really Writes better than he
talks,” then adding, ‘He talks ins
terestingly, too. i think some or his
prose is terrific."

Kristol told the governors that
the crisis or confidence in govern»
ment was a phenomonen that antes
dated Watergate and would outlive
it.

It was not confined to the United

GOV. ROBERT RAY

States, Kristol said, but was a pros
blem in alltheWestern democracies
due to conﬂicting demands on their
governments from the people, who
demand on the one hand increased
government services and, on the of
ther hand, lower taxes.

Kristal said there were three prir
mary obstacles to effectiveness and
efficiency in modern democratic
government; the poutlcians wholike
the bureaucracy minimally effec»
five, the way it is, because they
retain more power that way; the
mass media, which needs conﬂict
and crisis to make good news sto—
ries; and lack of patienceonthepart
of the electoreate,
immediate solutions to social pro-
blems aren't possible, Kristo] said:
“Things can’t be done, at least
not done well, without patience."
Gallup told the governors the ef—
iect of Watergate was more severe

than they might think and, contrary
to many analyses, had been a sig-
nificant factor in the local and state
elections held a few weeks ago,
Watergate would continueto bea ma
jor inﬂuence with the public, said
Gallup. “as long as it remains on
the tront page.”

A crowd of severalthousandgreete
ed the President when he arrived
at the riverfront motel where the
conference was held. Republican
Party officials had distributed tick—
ets to party stalwarts so that they
could be admitted to the roped»off
area near where the President stood
to Speak, those without tickets being
relegated to the back of the crowd.
One Woman reported being ejected
from the area, despite havingatick—
et, because she was carrying an
anti-Nixon sign.

After most of the crowd had diSr
persed, a group of about 2540
young people, including the student
government president at Memphis
State University, Staged a small-
scale demonstration advocating the
President's impeachment.
Governor Ray said he left the
meeting with a feeling that the
President will be “going to the
press and to the public” with his
version of Watergate and that he
would make available the tapes and
notes he has on the Subjectvarlous
governors disagreed, after the cons
versation with the President, on
whether the tapes were going to
be made available to the public and
the press or only to the court, and
on how many of the tapes would be
made available.

Nixon also seemed to have decid—
ed to cooperate and confer with the
Senate’s Watergate committee, Ray
said, although, according to another
governor, he did not feel obligated
to go down to Capitol Hill "and
appear under the klieg lights."

Asked by a British newsman to
assess the attitude of Iowans on
Watergate, Ray said that there was
great support for the presidency
in his state, but “confusionand min
ed feelings” about the President.
But Watergate did not play an im»
portant role in the recentlowaelec-
iiohs, he said

Symposium

by Robin Recant

Six Grinnell alumni participated in
the Law Symposium held at Grin»
nell on Friday November l7andsa-
turday, November 19. Themajorth»
eme of the symposium was Women
and Minorities in the law. Present
on the panel were Deborah K Mc-
Knight (.73) Northwestern Univer~
sity law student, Jon R. Gray (‘73)
University oi Missouri at Kansas
City law school, Gregory M. Coggs
("70), University of Michigan law
student, Hubert A Farbes (‘69)

United states Air Force attorney,
Ann M. Lusin (64), parliamentar—
ian of the Illinois House of Repre—
sentatives, and Arthur H, Travers
(‘57), acting dean of the University
of Colorado Law School. John Ad-
ams acted as moderator.

The first of the three seminars
held was entitled Minorities in the
Law. a major point expressed by
the panel was that they went into
law school believing that their law
education would enable them ln
some way to help change society.
However, law school definitely de-
tracted from their idealistic motlva»
tion. They found that the atmosphere
pushes them toward oontormity, es-
pecially in the first year, when all
students may take only required
courses. poverty Law, CivllLiberr
ties and other related fields are
slowly becoming integrated into the
curl lculum tor upper level students
alth ugh these topics are bitch in,
clilt ed in broader courses. At Nor»
thwestern, credit is given to third
and fourth year students for work-
ing as Legal Aid advisors.

Financial imperatives were anot-
her factor in causing many aspire
ing poverty lawyers to go into cor-
porate law, as many students must
borrow federal loans in order to
complete legal training and find the
emselyes in great debt when they
graduate.

of all groups engaged in law, wom-
en seemed to taoe the greatest dis
crimination. Judges, firms and cli-
ents often had adverse reactions to-
ward female advocates, although
this was also the case with black
and long haired lawyers.

Law as a Career was the topic
tor the evening discussion. Many
people, the panel said, are under
the impression that a law degree
generally leads to the actual court
room practice of law. This is just
not the case, as the vast majority
of law graduates go into rather

mundane law-related fields such

nose to the bakery.

Before anyone starts throwing
their ”day»olds" at me for spoil-
ing the adventure of Grinnell’s most
unique attraction, let it be known
that this schedule is not all in»
clusive. The whims and Ways of
Hanson’s wily bakers are likely to
manifest themselves in strange and
unpredictable ways. Turnovers and
“Horns" come only when the time
is ripe, and cookie day is not al-
ways all cookies.

Now, Grinnell student, you are
armed to the teeth with all of the
information necessary forexistance
in sugar heaven.

Held On law

as accounting, income tax adjust-
ment and municipal bonding.

Grinnell students expressed con—
cern with admissions requirements
into law school. HubertFarbessaid,
”Take what you enjoy-—your major
is relatively unimportant. Grades,

however, matter quite a bit. Gray
was convinced that “admission is

a totally random process.” Panel-
ist McKnight added that writing
skins were the greatest asset for
law school, and that any courses
that can provide you with these
are definitely helpiul.

Acceptance into law school is to-
ugh, but not as dimcult as finding
an interesting and well paying job
when you leave, as thousands of law
graduates are pouring into an ever
tightening job market.

The final seminar dealt with Wo-
men in Law. Law schools are pre-
sently seeing a large increase in
the percentage of female attendants.
Gone are the days of rejecting wo-
men from a legal education because
of the lack of female washroom fa»
cilities in law school buildings. The
Northwestern freshman class bo-
asts nearly 40 percent lemale en,
rollment as does the University of
Chicago and Colorado. Women are
beginning to be accepted on an equal
basis to men. Formerly only the
very top undergrads in law school
were female.

Women must confront extremely
difficult problems locating jobs in
the legal field, and when they do
iind employment, a plethora ot new

issues often arise. Many firms
and judges still express derogatory
ideas about women's abilities as
advocates, and are still under the
stereotype that lawyers are sup»
posed to be men. As more women
enter the field, the situation is im»
proving, but there is Still a long
way to go

The law symposium helped to dis,
pel many myths about law, both 3c,
academically and asacareer.ldeal_
istic students may have been a bit
crushed when they heard about the
limitations of a law degree (such
as the shortage of interesting jobs,
and possibilities in the area ofpuh-
llc servtce oreinted fields) and the
dilliculty oi pursuing their goals
while in law school On a slightly
more optimistic note, Debbie Mcr
Knight remarked “I Went to law
school with the idea that lcould
use my education to help people.
It'll be hard, but there’s got to be
a way."
