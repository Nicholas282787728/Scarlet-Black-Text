Grinllell's 1973 baseball squad finally swung into action yesterday aitei»
noon against William Penn College on the new North Field, The opener
had originally been scheduled on Tuesday and was to have been a doubler

However, poor weather and wet grounds forced postponement first until
Wednesday and ttien until Thursday, when only a single game was plnyetl.

prior to Thursday’s game, Coach Ray Boyd was wary about the team's
deiensive and offensive skills. After the game, he praised the work of
the ioiir pitchers and chided the teamfor its sloppiness in the other depart

ments.

Boyd and the team, however, are quite optimistic about their chances
this season Bolstered by the addition of several very talented ireshmen
and a junior and the return oiyunior Wes rngii, the Grinnell lineup looks
stronger than it has in years. The pioneers are working as a team, and
everyone is having a good time and looking forward to the possibility oi
the first winning season in quite a while.

Grinnell's iive hits were divided among Craig Zippe, John daigh, Rich
Arnold (all freshmen) and Jeii Dick, last year’steam batting leader. Zippe
had two hits in four attempts and Arnold hit the best ball oi the day, a
double, in his iii-st Grinnell atom. The basernnning oi Wes Fugii baffled
Penn all day and accounted ior the Pioneers’ first run, when he drew
the throw to second on a delayed steal and enabled the runnei-on third

to score on the play.
