A place to hang one’s heft *

by Toni Panteo

Returning to school after a tour-and-
a-half week vacation meant, for many,
adjusting to a schedule of studying and
classes. To some returning up»
perclassmen, though, it also meant a
week of sleeping in lounges, constant
trips to the student affairs office, and a
period of disappointmens, confusion,
and growing bitter feelings because of
the problems arising in room allot-
ments.

Arriving at Grinnell, several juniors
and seniors, some of whom had been
away on approved off-campus
programs, found that they had either
been placed in doubles or triples with
underclassmen or placed in no room at
all.

One case is that of senior Tom
Grauman. Last fall while studying in
Costa Rica he wrote his adviser to pre-
register him and to inform the school of
his return to campus this sesmester,
which she did. “I returned to find I had
no room, and Bob Jacobs and Jim
Tederman denying that they had any
knowledge of my returning. i had in
tended to move into the RA. suite in
Gates, which John Haigh was moving
out of so as to make a single for me, but
instead I was denied the room and it
was given to a first semeser junior. I
had a week of sleeping on a couch in the
lounge of Gates pit with no place for
clothes or storage, conditions which did
nothelp in keeping up with class work, I
finally received a bed and chest of
drawers but I think something is wrong
when a senior comes back and has to
worry about getting a decent room. rm
permanently in the basement lounge
but I still feel justified in claiming that
the. R.A. suite Should be mine.”

Sylvia Cate, a junior who returned
this semester from the urban studies
program, also had room difficulties.
“Last spring while still on campus I
talked to Bob Jacobs and he assured me
that when I returned this semester I
would have a single, but also added that
I should write in October and inform
him formally that I plan to return to
campus, which i did sending also a
housing form.

However arriving at
school Saturday the 18th I found I was
placed in the outer room of a three
room triple. After a week of living out of
two suitcases and discovering that
Jacobs wasn’t willing to start making
room change until the 22nd or 23rd
leaving several rooms unused and
empty, 1 was placed in a single in
Dibble."

Sylvia also said she experienced
great difficulties in getting back to
studying because of the unsettled
pattern of that week. in considering
why the problem occurred, Sylvia said,
“The situation was a slap in the face or
punishment to amke it more difficult on
people who decided to study in an off-
campus' program instead of stay on
campus.“

Assistant Dean of Student Affairs Bob
Jacobs, who is in charge of student

housing, explained the problem this
year as arising from the fact that even
though enrollment stayed the same
there was an increase of juniors and
seniors returning to campus who
wanted singles with not enough opening
up. “Furthermore, even though there
was a room shortage, we could not open
Dibble annex because it would have had
to be single sex because of the fact that
it has only one bathroom,” He added
that even though there are un»
derclassmen living in singles that
should be doubles and doubles that
should be triples, the school has no right
to move anyone together to open up
rooms unless they get a request for a
room change from the individual. ”I’ve
made about 200 placements and
changes this semester; some had been
made on a temporary basis just to give
everyone a bed. However, to solve the

problem altogether I wish we had full
enrollment at all times so I wouldn't
have to make these placements and
changes."

Returning to Grinnell atter a year
and a half absence, Diane Winters also
found herself roomless. ”My situation
is different than most and I don’t have
much to gripe about since I did even-
tually get a room on short notice, but it
seems that the whole problem stems
from giving out singles out last
semester like they going out of style
and not considering that the attrition
rate could be small."

with the recent difficulties and room
drawings a few months away, there
seems to be warrented a new look at the
present procedure for possible ims
provements and overhauling.

Visual tribute to Iowa.

by Douglas Halsey

Portrait of iowa, introduction by
Paul Engle. Photographs by John
M, Zielinski and others. Adams
Press, Minneapolis, Minn 1974 176
PP-

"Look at the map of iowa and
squint a little—" says author Paul
Engle, and “there is the stylized
outline of a hog. . the chunky,
rectangular shape. . .of a well-
cleaned carcass." So begins this
book’s colorful and unique look at
the state of Iowa.

Portrait of iowa is the type of
Book I have been looking for, until
now, without success. It is a cone
temporary photographic
testament to a fascinating state.

Paul Engle is a wellsknown Iowa
writer and poet, who founded the
Program in Creative Writing at the
Universitv of Iowa and presently
directs that University’s In-
ternatlonal Writing Program.

Engle’s introduction is a
humorous and folksy prelude to a
visually exciting book. For his
stance, he remarks that Iowa is in
the middle of a lot oi things. It is
ranked twenty-fifth in both land
area and population among the
fifty states, and culturally is “the
middle ground between the ex
tremes of American life.“ To
some, this may indicate
.mediocrity, but ,to.an Iowan, I
think, this means div rsity

Engle’s many anecdotes lend a
warm and friendly tone to what
might otherwise be a rather cool
book of photographs. He notes that
climate is a unique feature of Iowa,
mentioning that the thermometer
once fell from 65 degrees to zero in
a matter of six hours at Ames. “In
between a range of temperatures
from thirty below- zero to one
hundred and ten above, lives a
very cool citizen, undismayed even
by the risk of tornadoes.” Then
there is the old Military Road of
Iowa's history, which ironically
was only a plow furrow, and never
used in war. A farmer was hired
for the job, and. with a team often
oxen and a sodbreakin plow,
drove a iurrow from ubuque
through Iowa City and on south.

John Zielinski, working in both
black and white and color. has
divided the extensive photographic
section of the book into eight
sections: Rock (mostly limestone,
Iowa was once an ocean floor;
Water; Farmland; People;
heritage, Arts: Working; and
Fairs Each is a small visual essay
in itself, but is blended with the
other sections to produce an in-
teresting photographic essay on
iowa. It is interesting. i find,
because it makes no attempt to be
a history. it there is one thing there
is plenty of in iowa, its history.
Aild if there is another thing there
are plenty of, its history books
about Iowa 50 I found Portrait to
be a visually refreshing look at

contemporary ontf th a reﬁll '
, {layering oi-her‘itag - .-

Refreshing as it is, though, some
ofthe photographs are rather poor.
Some otherwise adequate pictures
have been enlarged to cover nearly
two full pages, making the reader's
eye notice the extreme graininess
rather than subject. other
photographs show poor selection;
they are over exposed, under
exposed or just plain dirty and
dusty. Granted, there are a lot of
pictures, but numbers should
never obscure the visual quality of
a book of photographs, especially
that of a professional, This small
criticism aside, the book does offer
quite an accurate and extremely
diverse look at the land, people and
activities of the state of Iowa.

The photographs of the book.
taken by Zielinski and others.
range from vistas of the
Mississippi and Missouri Rivers to
student strikes in Iowa City. They
capture the ﬂavor of the state
without becoming repetitiously
burdensome. The ratio of black
and white to color photographs is
good, because the color
reproductions are not high quality,
and on the Whole the book does not
try to assault the reader visually
by cramming its pages with pic-
tures. Instead, Portrait of Iowa is
an even blending of photographs
which represents the diversity of
its nature, and the solidarity of its
cultural position. John Zielinski is
an iowan whose photographs have
been given national attention on
the pages of Time and Life and -
