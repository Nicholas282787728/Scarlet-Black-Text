Water Polo is on the rise in
America and Grinnell is no
exception. We have here on
campus the nucleus of what
promises to be one of the
best water polo teams in the
history of the sport here.
Water polo has a short his
tory at Grinnell. Started two
years ago with only a handful
of members, it is now a burr
geoning team with fifteen reg-
ular players. As of yet the
sport is not inter-collegiate,
but hopes are strong that it
will turn varsity within the
next few years.

A team consists of seven
people; six players and one
goalie. The "tank" (better
known as a pool) in which the
game is played is twentyrfive
meters by forty-eight feet,
with goals at either end. The
rules are a mish-mosh of
soccer, hockey and polo. The
ball utilized looks like :1 vols
leyball, except that it's yellow
and weighs a fewmore pounds.
Water polo is an easy game
to play. All players are en-
titled to the use of one hand,
either right or left. The goa-
lie is the one and only except
tion because he is entitled to
the use of both hands, right
and left, or left and right, de-
pending upon how he feels at
the moment the ball is tossed
towards him. Another rule is
that no player who is floating
around in the tank can touch
the bottom. All manipulation
of the ball must be made
while the player is swimming.
Again, as before, the excep-
tion is the goalie who is al-
lowed to stand in the water
to defend his position.

Plays in water polo are pat-
terned after basketball plays,
and as in foOtball, the names
of the shots are colorful and
indicative of the actions in~
volved. For examples wehave
tipshots, backhand, whipshots,
and the everrpopular bounce
shot. . .
Because the team lacks
varsity status, several of the
teams first games will be
played against the high school
teams in the area. However,
the team did play against the
University of lowa on Tues-
day, and lost, 16-5. In addir
tion to the game against U.I.,
Coach Chris Freeberg is
hopeful of orgnizing games

Pioneers Fifth In les Duke

by David Raub

Saturday the Pioneer cross
country team hadtheirbiggest
home meet of the year, the 4-
mile Les Duke Invitational.
Sixteen teams showed up to
make a field of about 150 runs
ners.

Individually, Chuck McGrath
placed 4th for Grinnell, fac-
ing his toughest competition
yet this year in several little
all‘AmErican runners. Corr
sidering the tough course
(Country Club golfcourse) and
the very fast early pace (4:45
for the first mile, his time of
21:03 was excellent, though
nearly a mile behind the Wins
net. Dan Hildebrand and Paul
Miller also ran fine races,
coming in 24th and 3rd res‘
pectively, with Paulrecording
the best time of his career,
22:43.

Next were Mark Cochran,
who finally seems to have re-
covered from his knee injury,

Soccer T
“f

and Scott Weil, followed by
non-scorers Terry Seeberger
Torn Howland, and Bob Shir
elds. All five ran good races,
but unfortunately Grinnell's
team score suffered because
the last three had not been
designated as a part of the
varsity team before the race.
This was an unavoidable er
ror, since the varsity seven
are usually the first 7 fins
ishers in the previous week's

race. _ _
The final team order of finish

was Luther, Loras, Agustana,
St. Olaf, Grinnell. This is a
sign of the headsto- head con»
frontation shaping up between
Grinnell and St. Olaf for the
conference championship a
month from now.

This Saturday the Pioneers

will try to extend their string
of 15 straight dual meet vic-
tories when they meet Corr
nell and Parsons. The race
will start and finish at Ward
Field duringthe footballgame.

Grinnell's Steve Korstad dodges between two defenders in a
drive for the goal, but it was all to no avail: despite his
score The Pioneers only tied Monmouth 2.2 last Saturday.
Tony Wheeler scored the other Grinnell goal. When the final
whistle blew Grinnell Coach Keith Fisher wanted to play out
the tie, but Monmouth's coach declined.

The Scarlet and Black

by Mike Daly

Yea verily, the Grinnell
Commie Plot won a football
game, the first this season.
Duded up in scarlett from
helmet to knee pad, the Reds
stumbled past aweak Carleton
team, l9~7.

True to tradition, Grinnell
played at the level of football
of their opponents; in this
case, weak. However, the de-
fense managed to hold on crur
cial fourth down plays, and
the offense provided the “e.
cessary points. Mario Bog~
nanno, playing beth fullback
and middle linebacker, scored
Grinnell‘s first six points on
a two yard drive over right
tackle. However, Carleton
came back to lead 7-6 athalf-
time, when Mark Donaldson
found Willie Worthan open in
the end zone for a TD.

Third quarter action ums
lifeless until the very endwhen
Nick Russo smashed Carle~
ton‘s wouldrbe punt receiver
and Ed Hirsch recovered on
the home team 27*yard line.
As the fourth quarter began,
Hurricane Henry Corona
scored on a 25 yard counter

Whoopi'd‘o - - We Win!

play from the 27,usingabeau-
tiful cutback and some sur-
prising down field blocking.
Barry Huff’s conversion was
good and Grinnell led 13-7.

Fleet-footed Jon Grey com-
pleted his best day rushing
with a 4*yard soul power
plunge off tackle later in the
final quarter for the Reds last
TD. The remainder of the
fourth quarter, Carleton tried
in vain to riddle the Grinnell
secondary with passes, but
excellent coverage by Nick
Russo and Jim Pirolli pres
vented any set ring.

For you statistics buffs, HE
Eill "Wizzard” Dicks was 12
for 22 for 114 yards passing;
Pirolli caught 4 passes for 50
yards, and Ed Hirsch wught
5 passes for 51 yards. Carle-
ton had l4 first downsto Griw
nell's 12.

Next week's fun and games
will be on Ward Field against
those mean and nasty Cornell
Rams. It's Alumni Day, so I
encourage all OE Squaders to
get out and recruit an alum-
nis for the OB cheering sec-
tion. Remember we need their
dough! Ram on!
