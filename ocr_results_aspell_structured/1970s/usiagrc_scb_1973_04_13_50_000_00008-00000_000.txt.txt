levy Blanks Coe 1-0

by Marty Iker

Grinnell’s Pioneers travelled th»
rough a strong, cold wind last Sat-
urday to take on the cocky Kohawks
oi Coe in Cedar Rapids and quickly
cut them down to size by handing
them a brilliant er loss in the first
game oi the conierence twin bill,
Senior Mike Levy pitched the fin~
est game oi his Grinnell career,
allowing the Kohawks a mere three
hits and two walks enroute to Grin-
nell’s first victory and first shutout
in quite some time Levy received
great backing iroin his deiehse, es
pecially outiielders Brian Cook, Wes
Fujii and Jeff Dick and second base»
man Mark Hanisch, The whole de-
fensive effort was brilliant.

Although Coe hit some good shots,
someone was there to haul them in
in almost every instance, Coe’s
three hits were scattered through
the iirst, third and sixth innings;
one other Kohawk reached base
by virtue oi a Grinnell error

The Pioneers scored their lone run
early and made it last In the see
Cond inning, first baseman EillJohn—
son broke out at a personal dry sp-
ell with a single and was advanced
to second by Mark Hanisch’s san
rifice bunt, Levy’s infield grounder
moved Johnson over to third and
he scored When a low pitch hit
the plate and bounced straight up
in the air.

Coe’s late inning threat to tie up
the ballgame was eiiectively thwar-
ted by Levy and catcher Jack
Hamman. The first hitter for Coe
reached base but was gunned down
by Hamman’s throw when he at-
tempted to steal second after the
second hitter had missed On a hunt

attempt Levy struck out that hat—
ter and retired the next man on a
pop-up back to the mound, ending
the game.

Obviously taken aback by the slun-
ning fii'strgame periormalice by the
pioneers, Coe started their second.
game oiiensive early, They capi-
talized on Wes Fujii's control trr
oubles ior a fiverrun first inning
aiter Grihhell had jumped out to a
1-0 lead in the top of that frame.
Grinnell made it 5.4 with three
runs oi their own in the top oi
the second, but Coe Came back
with five more in their next atr
hat oii ruiii and reliever Craig
Zippe Things settled down the rest
oi the way, as each team added one
more run, the final score being 1%
5 in favor of Coe.

Hitting stars of the day were Craig
Zippe, who went ionr-ior-seven, and
Bill Johnson, who added a triple
in the second game to his single
in the first.

A pleasant surprise was Zippe’s
masteriul handling oi Cue’s big bats
during the last iive innings, when
he yielded only one run. Although
Zippe wasn’t slated for much action
on the mound, he is a welcomeaddi-
tion to Grinnell's small but deter
mined pitching staii.

The snow has put a damper on out-
side action for the past week, but
the Pioneers have been Working out
indoors and are looking eagerly
forward to their next game, the date
oi which is, as yet, uncertain. How—
ever, Spirits are high, and the team
is sure that last Saturday's victory
was only the iirst of many to come.
Look out!
