Most people concerned are
satisfied. it seems, with the gains
Grinnell has made in hiring
women. Currently. women make
up about 23 per cent of the college
facultyiabout the percentage of
women degree holders in the
country However, complaints
persist coneerningthe inequality of
salaries at Grinnell. According l0
Barrett’s report. four female
employees are underpaid.
Deminoff notes that both President
Turner and Dean Walker have
assured him that this will be
corrected.

"I HOPE we get some better
results from future hirings Right
now I question the administration's
sincerity.” He concludes, “the
future of STOPIT is up to
students.”

Both Deminoff and Atwell,
however, feel that the school is
doing everything it can do to
recruit and hire blacks “The
applicantpool for blacks is small,”
Deminoff begins “One science
department has an opening which
received 65 applicants, and, as far
as we can tell. none of them are
black, and only three are women.”
He goes on to relate an instance of
one black potential Candidate who
would not consider Crrlnncll
because of the Size of the town.

ATWELL iltltls that in the past
there has been a problem with
retaining blacks. “The town of
Grinnell has no black com~
munity. and when black
professor's children grow older,
the family often moves to an area
where there is a black community

“Last year. seven per cent of the
faculty was minority. but we lost
several black professors this year,
and in a school this size every
person isa percentage point. Seven
per cent just about matches the
grad school percentage of
minorities, so that was pretty
good, but this year we don't look
as well." This year there are three
blacks at Grinnell tone of whom is
on leave), thus the percentage of
black faculty members is slightly
under three per cent.

GRINNELL'S AA policy
demands that “very serious at
tention“ be given to women and
minority candidates. Atwell's
committee and the affirmative
action officer are charged with
making sure that this is done. The
committee meets at least two or
three times per month, and
welcomes anyone to come and
complain or comment on AA,
Atwell says that complaints are
looked into, and then the com-
mittee reports back to the person
filing the complaint “If the
committee believes that the entire

community should be notified, it<

will do so,” she adds,

Besides the official college AA
committee, NOW, STOPIT, and
potentially SGA are ready to
monitor and comment on af-
firmative action policy.

,in is apparently alive and well
at Grinnell. and those involved
hope the college will continue
moving ln a positive direction, “We
have had some success, especially
With Women.” Atwell concludes,
“but we must be careful not to rest
on our laurels. The entire come
munity is aware of the problem i
hope we retain that awareness."

CSL revision sought

by Kathy \Villhoitc

The Committee on Student Life
debated a proposed amendment to
rliles governing its Structure
Thursday evening,

The proposal. submitted by CSL
Joint Board representative Greg
Youtz and SGA President Joll
Neiderbach. suggests that policy
proposals which the Joint Board
and CSL cannot agree on go to a
Conference committee ConSlSiing
of three members ,lrom each
organization According to the
amendment, “ this conference
committee shall make every effort
to formulate a policy proposal
acceptable to both the CSL and the
SGA,"

Under [he current struclure, in
case of a deadlock, both the

_CSL and the Joint Board proposals

are presented to President Turner.
\\llo theft chooses from the two

This .\'t-:\v procedure of trying
to work out differences and settle
on a compromise before going to
Turner would ensure that the CSL
“won't be able to ignore the Joint
Board," according to Neiderbach
it also would make Ims
plementalion of college policy
more difficult, which Youtz feels is
“a good thing."

The proposed amendment also
gives son power in setting CSL's
agenda. the Joint Board “may
recommend topics, . .and the
Committee shall give due con-
sideration to these recomr
mendations.”

Under the amendment. CSL
members may be removed by a
twothirds vote of the appointing
body: the Joint Board. This

provision is included to avoid
future confusion, such as that
which occurred recently, over
SGA's right to remove committee
members.

CSL member Marca FOX agrees
that “the relationship between CSL
and SGA must be clarified," but
she disputes the assertion that the
Joint Board has the power to
remove CSL appointees, Although
student CSL members are ap-
pointed by the Joint Board, she
clmms CSL “is not an SGA com-
mittee. . .lt is not a sidearm of
SGA "

Youtz asserts that an effeclive
mechanism for removal of CSL
members is needed, and says that
the necessity for a two thirds vote
of the Joint Board is “an efficient
restraint vlithin the mechanism."
and would "avoid capricious
removal of CSL members by the
Joint Board.”

Neiderbélch calls the amendment
“a relatively moderate change"
Its intent is to “insure what is
supposed to be a student govern
ment process from being
monopolized by a few extremist.
unrepresentative students."

WITHOUT lhis modification.
Neiderbach predicts the CSL will
become “more politicized" and
Joint Board members will be
compelled to choose CSL members
based upon their political stance
rather than on “what rational
decision makers" they are and
“how good of committee persons
they will be."

The CSL. Chaired by Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman.
consists of six students appointed
by the Joint Board. two faculty
members, and four ad»
ministrators,

Both Youtz and Fox predict the
controversy over the structure of
this committee will not be resolved
quickly. “It‘ll probably go on
several weeks,“ says Youtz.
