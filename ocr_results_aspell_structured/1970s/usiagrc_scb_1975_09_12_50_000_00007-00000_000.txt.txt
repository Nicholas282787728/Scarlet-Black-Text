Skelly‘s Truck Stop appears to slumber by day. hut in pre-dawn hours

things are considerably dilrerent.

To the uninitiated Grinnellian,
the truck stops oi Grinnell are just
another part of that “other World”
that seems to exist beyond the
invisible academic and social
,ooundaries delineated by The
Grinnell Ekpcrience. Oh, what a
pity it would be to spend four years
at Grinnell without actually ex-
periencing one ol lhose euphoric,
late night Skel-runs,

There are actually two
lruckstops ln Grinnell’s vicinity
(both Skelly’s by some strange
quirk ol coincidence), but they are
really quite diiterent. Hallner’s
Truck stop is the closest, and also
the best known. Located on High
way 146. right off l-BD, Hanner's is
a small truckstop by anyone's
standard. Ah, but it has character!
Oh, the experience oi those late
night Skel-runs listening to WWL'S

with unforgettable M00»Cow
Cream Dispensers.

A few words on the Moo-Cow
creamers might be in order. First,
they do not actually Moo when you
tilt them. Second, let’s not be so
naive as to think that the whitish
liquid that usually comes out of the
obnoxious dispensers is actually
cream. Third, they are for sale, as
are almost all ol the fixtures at
Hanner’s~make a decent offer

hours. Hopefully this is only a
temporary catastrophe,

Farther down the road is
Dickey’s Prairie Home oi Malcom,
the other lruckstop in the Grinnell
vicinity. Dickey's is much larger
than Hanner‘s, and it Hanner’s

“Put color in your sex life with

prophylactic in tour exotic colors"
(blue, red, black and green), or
“Get together with a Cutie Nudie

Or how about, “Pandora's
Box, a grab bag of sexy surprises."
Not to mention, of course, the
stimulating “Tickle your friends
with ‘Frenchie the Tickler’. At
11:30 you may wish you had this.”
Last but not least is a warning

Health: “Veneral Diseaseran

Dickey's does have a number of
other attractions that Hanner’s
can't match. such as good
Southern-style biscuits and gravy
(Kentucky Will‘s favorite), 3 pin-
ball machine that literally cannot
be beat, and decent coilee with real
cream.

A trip to Hanner’s or Dickey’s in
the wee hours at the morning,
makes you ieei like a real part of
the towel trucking cultureiand is
also a lot of fun. Dickey’s in
Malcom is too far away to become
habit forming, but let’s hope
Hannar‘s opens up tor late night
indulgence soon.
