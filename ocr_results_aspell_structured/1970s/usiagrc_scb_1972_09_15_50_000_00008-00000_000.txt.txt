Football Season Begins

tomta at College hei insist
Eight freshmen and {our ' Other
newcomers to the Grinnell football
squad hold down starting spots in
the offensive and defensive line~
ups when the Pioneers host Coe
College at 130 pm, in Ward Field
Saturday.

It will go into the record books as
a nonrloop affair although both clubs
are members of the Midwest Confe-
rence. When the conference Voted
to pare the league schedule trom
nine to eight games for 1972, the
Grinnell-Coe contest was one of
the games deleted. But the two
long-time opponents agreed toopen
the season witha noneconi‘erence
tilt.

”We have been making good pros
grass, but we still have an awful
lot to do," said Coach Edd Bowers,
whose 38-man Grinnell squad in
cludes 16 freshmen. Bowers is
pleased with the quick adjustment or
the freshmen to college football and
is hoping the addition of size in the
line and speed among the backs
and ends will perk up the Pioneer
offense and toughen the defense.

Senior veteran quarterback Jeff
Dick directs a passing attack that
has been sharp in early practice
sessions, but a lack oi consistency
in the running game concerns Eo—
werst ”Dick has been throwing the
ball well," he said, “and, despite

the loss of Jim Pirolli and Ed
Hirsch, the two top pass catchers
in Grinnell iootball history, we have
a good group of receivers.”

Lack of depth at the quarterback
position is perhaps Bowers’ blge
gest worry, Freshman Craig Zippe,
the number two man, is currently
sidelined with a knee injury.

Freshmen tabbed for starting jobs
tomorrow are Brent Allison, Brian
Cook, Scott Fackrell, Jim Fallace,
Tom Goetz, Wayne Murray, Monte
Tomson and Dennis Walters. Other
newcome'rs in line lor tirst-string
jobs are luniors Wally Bowers and
Mike Rosenfeld, and sophomores
Jim Casey and Chip Hall.

Hildebrand Heads Cross Country

by John Lotn

One of the most rigorous and
demanding sports is cross—country
running. This is a sport that re-
quires full dedication and great
amounts or patience. Crossrcountry
running can bring rewards in many
ways. Sure, coming in first is every
runner’s dream, but, by lust being
able to finish the course brings
great satistaction. it is uplilting to
an individual who knows that he is
operating at his maximum elfin
ciency.

preparing i‘oracrossecountry seas
son requires hours oi hard runlung,
The Grinnell College team is no
different. Eachcross-countrycoach
has his own training methods and
Coach Raymond Obermliler'has his
own also. First of all he has the

in a continuing effort to preserve Grinnell’s tine reputation,
the on Squad will once again strongly participate in cooperation
with the various Grinnell athletic teams. Once again, we hope to
cheer our boys to victory, while at the same time raising general
havoc and enjoying ourselves in the process.

We must never forget that we do not make fun at our team; rather
we do anything to destroy the moral fiber of our opponents, thereby
insuring a complete physical, mental, and psychological victory
for the Pioneers. (Not to mention getting together tor some good
times after the game with those dynamite Cornell cheerleaders
with the purple “C" on their chests.)

Which brings me to the point. Our first BIG GAME is this Saturday
against the animals from Goa and we need all of you at the GAME.
(Remember, you do not join the 0B Squad, you are the OB Squad.)
Bring Ramos and whatever else that will make you feel and act
the fool. Remember, it you can’t laughatyourselt, at least let others

laugh at youl "Pigskin

rnniiers gradually increase their
running distance as the season pro-
grosses.

Those runners who have had pre-
vious cross-country experience
would naturally start at a greater
distance level than the novice run-
nel'. Once the runners have estab-
lished their peak, they run about
six to ten miles it day during the
scllool week. and on weekends they
rlln about fourteen to sixteen miles
on their own.

What Coach Obermiller stresses
most is having a variety or work
outs and increasing their quality.
Ohermiller has such an array of
practices that he usually doesn't
repeat a specitic drill until two
weeks after he first introduced it.
In increasing the quality otthe work—
outs, Obermiller, for example has
the runner run hills instead of flat-
lands, thus causing the team to run
a little harder.

After having the best conierence
runner tor the past tour years and
accumulating eighteen straight dual
meet victories, the Crime“ team's
future is hard to predict. The team
will consist or only three returning
runners, but they will be joined by
foul-teen new and eager prospects,
Here the question or experience

could prove to be vital.
Another problem is that the team
has already suffered some injuries
to key runners. However, it is
hoped that the great enthusiasm ot
the team will do more than make
up for the gap Still, the team

Will be hard pressed to equal its
third place conierence showing. Dan
Hilderbrand will be the team’s lead '
runner this year and with his capa—
bilities, it might not be too long
betore some of Chuck McGrath's
records are broken.

This year Grinnell will participate
in both dual meets and “big” meets.

A dual meet is one where a team
runs against two other teams. The

distance or the course is usually
tour miles long but this may vary
at some meets, In a dual meet a
team can Consist Of an unlimited
amount of runners,

A “big” meet usually Consists oi
about fifteen teams. Here, the com-
mon procedure is running seven men
and counting the top live scores.
This brings us to the question of
how scoring is done in a meet.
The team with the least amount of
points is the winner. The runner
who finishes first counts as one
point, the runner who tinished second
counts as two, and so on down the
line. So, it Grinnell's runners
finish first, third. fourth, seventh
and ninth theteam is awardedtwenty
iour points.

Though crossecountry is not a big
spectator sport, if one has a slight
knowledge of long distance running
he can appreciate the dilterent and
distinct styles of the runners. Th»
rough cross»country running one can
discover how far his physical capar
biiities can take him and one can
be quite surprised by the result,
