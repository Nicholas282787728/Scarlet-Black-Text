People’s lobby Tactics Succeed

by Maine West

During the last three weeks
there have been several types
of anti-war protest in Wash*
ington, D.C. At the basis of
each of these demonstrations
has been the same strongded»
ioation to nonrviolence, but
each has developed a different
tactic.

The April 24 march on the
Capitol was much like that of
November, 1969 in size, and
even more non-violent and
festive in mood. However, the
People's Lobby of AprilZS- 30
and the May Day activities of
May 1 - Sare both the outcome
of a growing feeling that big
marches just are not themost

,appropriate or effective res-

ponse to the war in Southeast-
Asia.

Policy Set For Darby Concerts

The Social Policies and Reg-
ulations Committee has con-
cluded three weeks of debate
on the Darby concerts prob-
lem.

They have made the following
recommendation:

(1) that all college students
be admitted to Darby by pre.
senting their ID card
(2) that 600 guest tickets be
made available on a first-
come first? served basis
(3) that during the firstthree
days tickets are available one
should be given to each stud-
ent who presents an ID card
(Al) that after the third day
tickets be given to Grinnell
students in blocks of up to
five.

A fifth provision, that any
remaining tickets be made
available to the public the day
before and the day of the con-
cert, was defeated by a very
narrow margin (4’3).

The committee attached a
rationale for the recommen-
dation thatmentioned ensuring

rights and privileges of stud‘
cuts with respect to interfer-
ence from transients at con-
certs, but recognized that one
of the students' rights is to
entertain personal guests.

The committee's recommen-
dation on parking regulations
has been accepted by Presi-
dent Glenn Leggett. Allsopho-
mores, juniors and seniors
may now bring cars to cam-
pus. They must all be regis-
tered and stickered.

Students on flnancialaidmust
clear any car with Director
of Financial Aid Nicholas Ry-
an, who may adjust the aid of
anyone who does bringa car.

The committee will discuss
implementation of the new
rules next week down at the
Longhprn. Dean of Students
Conney Kimbo suggested that
the Burling, ScienceandDarby
parking lots would probably
be placed off limits to stud'
ents, with the possibility that
violating cars might be tick-

Tutorial Guidelines Proposed

The Freshman Year Com~
mittee, as authorized by the
faculty, has considered guide-
lines for the establishmentand
conduct of the Freshman Tut-
orial program.

The objectives of the prog-
ram are as follows: 1) topr0*
vide the enteringfreshman the
opportunity to participate in
a learning situation whichdifr
tors in both form and method
from the standard lecture/
discussion class of his high
school experience; 2) to per-
mit the student to explore in
some depth a particular topic
of interest to him and his in~
structor; 3) to illuminate
methods of inquiry rather than
the mastery of a particular
disciplinary subject; 4) to
give special attention to writ
ing and the critical analysis
of tests; 5) to provide initial
preparation in techniques and
methods for independent
study.

6) also, to serve as a prac-
tical orientation program for
the use of the library; 7) to
improve the present under*\-
class academic advising pro?

gram by combining the roles
of tutor andacademicadviser;
8) to promote the scholar/
apprentice relationship be
tween tutor and student in a
small group learning situa~
tion; 9) to enable the tutor to
give special attention to the
individual needs and interests
of the students in his tutorial
in planning their academic
program; and 10) to allow ex-
perimentation in teaching
techniques which will have an
inﬂuence upon the whole cur-‘
riculum of the college.

The guidelines proposed by
the committee are as follows:

1. Experience has shown that
group meetings may be bene~
ficial. To maintain the nature
of the tutorial, however, it is
suggested that the tutors meet
frequently with groups of no
larger than four students to
discuss and criticize individ-
ual projects andpapers. While
preparation for independent
study and learning is a goal
of the tutorial, the tutorial is
not an "independent” and the
tutor will be responsible for
giving structure to the prog—

ram.

2. Except in unusualcircum-
stances, at least four pieces
of written work from each
student shall be criticized by
the tutor and returned to the
student during the semester.

3. Four (4) credits will be
granted for successful com‘
pletion of the tutorial.

4. All tutorials will be gra-
ded on a Credit/Fail basis,
with written evaluations by
the instructor which will be—
come part of the student‘s
record. Students will receive
this evaluation. Instructors
will NOT provide a grade al~
ong with their assignment of
CIEdit/Faii.

5. In the process ofselecting
or assigning students to tut-
orials, the entering freshman
will inform the collegeno later
than 1 August ofhis choices "
ranked as among five (5) tut-
orials. Whereverpossible, the
student will be given one of
his five choices as a tutorial.

6. Students selected for the
special sections will be invi—
ted to take the tutorial in a

sored by the People‘s Coali-
tion for Peace and Justice,
was an attempt by individuals
to communicate theirgrlevan-
ces and demands to the federal
employees whose decisions
both continue the war andser-
iously affect the quality of
American life. The target
institutions were Congress,
the national headquarters of
the Selective Service and the
Internal Revenue Service, and
the Departments of H.E.W. and
Justice.

May Day was an attempt to
"stop the government" be—
cause it had not yet stopped
the war. That the participants
did. in fact. hope to be effec-

tive is documented by the tre- '

mendous planning and strate-
gizlng tint went into this ef‘
fort.

Any evaluation ofthe success
of the People's Lobby or May
Day must be done with regrd
to their stated purposes. The
People’s Lobbyaohievedmany
of its aims. May Day, however,
was a failure. And there are
reasons why these facts came
to be.

The People’s Lobby succeed-
ed not because the lobbyists
actually got to talk with the
employees of the target insti~

tutions, but rather bemusethe
protesters used symbolic ex
pression when direct commu-
nitation ms impossible.

The People's Lobby succeed-
ed at the Selective Service
when, after already being for-
ced to walk away from work
through several hundred sing-
ing and chanting demonstrac
tors, the employees returned
the next morning to find a
"human carpet" covering
their path. They were invited
to walk over this carefully
choreographed double layer of
human bodies, as a symbol of
the way in which the draft
tramles over human lives
each day. The employees then
watched as 250 lobbyists were
slowly arrested and carried
peacefully to jail.

The People’s Lobby succeed-
ed at IRS when several hunda
red employees disobeyed offi-
cial directives, to ignore the
lobbyists and pull the curtains
on their office windows, and
came to share thepies offered
by members of the War Tax
Resisters organization. The
pies were cut in pieces pro-
portional to the manner in

‘ which tax spending is divided

between defense, health, wel-
