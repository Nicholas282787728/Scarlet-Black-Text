Censorship obstructs

it has been brought to my at
tention that in the past few weeks
there have occurred three in-
stances of outright and un-
compromising censorship by the
editor of the Campus Memo. which
merit recognition by the campus
community as a whole.

ApparenLly the editor of the
Memo misunderstands, and
concordantly mistrusts gay ac-
tivists. when a member or the gay
community submitted the an-
nouncement for the group's first
meeting two weeks ago, the second
and ﬁnal sentence of the an
nouncement was omitted. The
second sentence was added [or
humorous effect; the sentence
read: ” Afterwards we (the gay
community) will recruit at the bar
(in the Publ" I am told that the
editor feared that some people
might think that'the gay com-
was actually going to' “recruit”
(for the Army?) in the Pub. But let
me assure him and anyone else
who might harbor Similar fears,
that the gay community doesn’t
need to “recruit” at the Pub, nor
elsewhere on campus. People are
busy “recruiting” themselves
whether others like it or not.

THE other two instances of
censorship by the Memo editor
occurred this past week. A
member of the women’s group
submitted an announcement which
mentioned Anita Bryant’s name
and urged everyone in the campus

 

community to join the demon»
stration in Des Moines Oct. 14th
against Bryant, whom the original
announcement claimed to be a
“crusader against human rights."
This time, the editor of the Memo
didn’t want to risk any legal bat-
tle(s) with Anita Bryant over her
status as a “crusader against
human rights."

Are we to presume, as the editor
of the Memo seems to, that Anita
Bryant would waste the time,
money and energy to support a lost
cause (her own) in the courts?
Furthermore, could anyone
present a rational argument that
Anita Bryant is not a “crusader
against human rights?” Let me
say that if she “crusades" against
gay rights, then she crusades
against millions of people’s righm
as humans, including my own, and
that doesn’t make me feel'the least
bit happy.

The third instance of censorship
occurred when a member from a
group of concerned students of
leftist political persuasion at-
tempted to submit a general notice
of interest to the entire college
community, The notice, which was
to announce their participation last
weekend in the demonstration at
Kent State, was refused on the
grounds that it was not appropriate
material for the Campus Memo.
Doesn't the Memo exist to serve
the entire campus community.

Cause of death: boredom

Death by boredom is the most
painful death known to man. It's
more painiul than hanging, kicking
or heating. it has been recently
proven more painful than death by
whining, for years thoughtto be the
most excruciating death on earth.
All the victims of this fate (and
there are more than you would
expect) are found \Vlth a look of
unbelievable torture on their
faces, an expression that is seen
more and more everyday.

Boring someone to death or just
boring someone to a point oi pain
without killing him is becoming
more popular by the minute, A
very famous case of boring
someone to death a iew years back
seemed to trigger the popularity of
the torture. A girl was bored to
death in the Palace Movie Theatre
in New York City by watching a
King Family triple ieature, There
were thirty or iorty people in the
lobby who did nothing to aid her.
True, the bystanders did not want
to get involved, but I think there is
something in everyone that wants
to see others in the pain oi
boredom, and 'this is what
restrained the moviegoers lrom
helping the poor girl.

HAVEN'T YOU

ever seen

 

someone purposely use boredom to
inﬂict pain on someone else? An
irate wiie, ior example. The
Smiths (not their real name) go to
a cocktail party when, after a few
drinks, Mr Smith proceeds to do
his imitation of an allsmoose choir,
when he finally returns to his seat
(and Mrs, Smith), she begins to
babble on aimlessly about her
frozen Zinnia collection and about
how Babka Neazskl isn’t getting
enough cheese The result is ob
vious. Mr. Smith and all the guests
cringe with pain and hold their
cars, while the host promises never
to invite the Smiths to a party
again.

But boredom is used even more
ingeniously. in many countries
under military rule, torturing with
boredom is a highly eiiective way
of getting information from subs
versives. One oi the most popular
tortures in Chile (not its real
name) is to strap the student,
professor, or any other political
enemy to a chair, and then to force
him to listen to soldiers reading
scripts irom the old television
series “My Mother the Car.”
However. this is a very risky
torture; since the pain is so acute,

 

 

bulk of this community?

As an individual who finds much
value in the basic concepts of
socialist- and lesbian-feminism, I
am hurt by the Memo editor's
decision to censor all or part oi any
announcements which concern my
plea ior human rights. As a student
at this college, I am cheated of the
simple right to know what other
students are doing on campus and
oii, and why they are doing what
they are doing.

FINALLY, as an individual and
asa Grinnell student, Isuffer in the
long»run, as does every other
Grinnell student, from the Memo
editor's refusal to publish an
opinion undoubtedly contrary to
his own. With his refusal to print
Anita Bryant’s name and the
statement that she is a “Crusader
against human rights," the editor
of the Memo was in effect sanCs
tioning the actions of Anita Bryant
and refusing to recognize the fact
that She led an effective “Crusade"
against human rights. Apparently,
the editor found it difﬁcult to uns
derstand gay rights to be one of
many human rights desperately in
need of responsible support.

The editor should have sacrificed
a few of his personal beliefs and
probable misconceptions (as
fostered by a predominantly
\vhite,male, heterosexual society)
and taken the “risk" to support the
announcements submitted by the
gay, ieminist and leitist groups.

some prisoners lose consciousness
or die beiore they can speak.

ANOTHER less violent type of
boredom is used by pickpockets.
As you are walking down the
street. the iirst pickpocket. or
“hook" as he is known in police
jargon, walks up to you and
whispers something very boring in
your car, such as the stock market
ﬂuctuations of the last three years.
Then while you are recovering
from the shock of such Sudden and
blatant boredom, the second pick-
pocket (the “line and sinker”)
snatches your purse or wallet and
you wish you had listened to Karl
Malden and had purchased
travelers cheques.

So, as you can see, the uses of
boredom are many, and this is just
a mere sampling of what to expect
in the iuture How many
unrecorded uses of boredom go by
every day, no one knows.

BUT THERE is a thread of hope.
Scientists are experimenting with
boredom for possible use as a
laxative, and many other major
breakthroughs are expected
anyday. From here on it‘s
anybody’s ballgame.—Bill

Grinnell’s progressivism needs revival, rejuvenation

To the editor: We would like to
respond to the article by Bruce
Weindruch in the September 23
issue While it is commendable
that he believes the term “Grinnell
Way" should encompass more
than just the “liberal" point oi
view, it is not the misuse oi this
expression that accounts lor the
unpopularity oi conservative
campaigns. Spcakers, and the like.

Grinnell is wellsknown as a
progress've institution, both
academically and socially, and will
naturally attract .morc students
with liberal leanings. It is this
reputation that the students enjoy
and wili wish to perpetuate; hence.
Paul chezy ovcr Philip Crane.

regardless of worthiness.
we, however. are worried that

Grinnell's progressivism goes no

iurther than its reputation. It
seems that a large section of the
student body is coming down with a
case of “utopia fever.” This
disease is Characterized by the
failure to care about anything
outside one’s own little world,

It is sad that more people don't
realize that their ”own little
world" extends beyond the
periphery oi Grinllell College. Rob
and i had trouble iinding just live
people interestcd and caring
enough to on up the car tor the trip
to the Kent Statc rally, Granted,
K S U is 600 miles away, but the
fact that the tragedy could have
occurrcd on any campus having
'demonslratlons at that time should
bring the issue much closer to the
Grinnelllan’s heart. Though I
would be more than happy to be

proven wrong on this point, any
major activism seems to be con-
iined to a minority.

One of this minority, Jon
Nelderbach, wassubjected to some
rather scathing remarks in Mr
Weindruch’s article. Mr.
Neiderbach‘s current activism in
South African human rights, as
well as his interests in the farm
workers and aiiirniative action, is
very admirable in that he is
showing that he cares about
someone besides himseli He is as
right in working for these im
portant issues as Mr Weindruch is
in Co-chalrlng thc FordsLeach
committee.

So Mo Udall lost, is it, Mr.
Weindruch, only right to back a
sure winner? Gerald Ford lost, too,
Rob lleiiak, Kurt Schroeder

The elements of progressive social
policy, especially as they aiiect
large groups of minorities (eig,
affirmative action plans), should
be supported by all responsible and
concerned members of the college
community, including the ad-
ministration and those who are
employed to encourage open
,channels of communication and

plea for human rights 1

understanding.

LET the Campus Memo truly
serve the campus c0mmunity~
may it not reilect merely one
man’s prejudices or one
ideological viewpoint, Let it reﬂect
and respond to the needs and
ideologies of many groups oi in-
dividuals throughout the Grinnell
campus.

 

 

Open Space

By Mark Krause

I am pleased to see that Jon
Neiderbach and Jim Stuart have
brought the issue oi US. corporate
investment in South Africa's
apartheid system to this campus,
South Africa’s Whites have secured
one of the highest standards of
living in the world by enslaving
their black population. South
Africa’s blacks are confined to
impoverished reservations (the
bantustans), being allowed to
leave only to fill jobs as servants,
factory workers. or farm laborers

The area outside the bantustans
is in realitya national labor camp,
in which blacks are assigned
places to work, eat and sleep. Their
movements are restricted through
the passbook system by a security
iorce which dwaris any other in
black Africa, Besides freedom, the
blacks are denied association with
their spouses and families,
education, and the ability to think
for themselves. The [act that
blacks earn incomes does not alter
the reality oi slavery, Those in
comes only keep their recipients
from rioting along with their
children, who have no incomes to
lose.

AMERICAN corporations, in-
cluding ones Grinnell College has
invested in, have $16 billion in
vested in South Africa (about 17
per cent oi the total ioreign in-
vestment there), from which they
generally get a 20 per cent annual
return. But divestiture will only
soothe our consciences, not attack
the problem,

First of all, almost none of those
assets can be removed, They would
only be sold to new owners, who
would perpetuate apartheid, and
probably earn as much in proiits.
Management can be retained or
easily replaced. The loss of direct
access to U 5. technology would be
no real loss, since Similar
technology can be bought or
developed locally (South Africa
already has atomic power and
advanced aerospace industries).
Only a trade embargo would hurt
the South African economy,
especially since the U.S. is South
Africa’s biggest trading partner.

MilliE importantly, the black
workers of South Africa are ac-
tually priviledgcd in comparison to
those still on the bantustans and
the unemployed ol neighboring

 

 

countries, who emigrate lo South

NOW. IF Grinnell and other

educational institutions were able
to lorce American corporations to
divest themselves of South African
assets, those corporations would

tries to invest in.

Foreign investment is generally
supported as a means of bringing
modern industries to un-
derdeveloped countries. But those
modern industries generally
produce raw materials for export
to developed countries (wllo set the
prices) or luxury goods for local
elites, using imported machinery
and manufactured materials, and
providing little employment Since
divestiture of South African assets
would not appreciably harm the
apartheid economic system, and
would lead to further exploitation
oi other people, it is hard to support
on any but moral grounds

The real question is that of in
vesting in economic imperialism,
which few of us really oppose,
because we all benefit from it.
Many of the things we buy are
cheaper ior having been made with
raw materials from un-
derdeveloped countries that US
companies paid minimal prices
for, Remember what fun we had
when oil sold for a dollar a barrel?
Other goods are cheaper for having
been put together in countries
where laborers earn subsistence
wages, and taxes, which could fund
expanded social services, are kept
low to attract investors. Foreign
export markets also help keep
American workers employed.
which is one of our greatest needs.
Finally, repatriated profits
(usually many times larger than
the original investment) help iurid
our charities, public broadcasting
T.V. shows, museums, and
colleges like Grinnell. Discons
tinuing investments in the un
derdeveloped world and ending
imperialism would necessitate
lundarnental changes in our
economic system and liie style.

BRUCE \Veindruch's hero,
Phillip Crane. and other con~
servatives are so impressive
because they see it is in our own
interest to preserve our exploitive
relationship with the Ill'ls
derdcveloped world in the name of
preserving our economic system
and democracy. 0n the other hand,
our great liberals are unable to
make the hard choices between
their admirable social consciences
and the comforts of home. But the
problem is not repressive exs
ploitation by white supremacists
as much as it is our own selfish
exploitation oi the underdeveloped
world. We must look the real issue
square in the face and make hard
choices. if we reject imperialism
““5 only presents ncw hard choices
of whether to Continue on ex-
ploitive hic style or adopt a
counterculture, and whether (0

or try to end imperialism through
