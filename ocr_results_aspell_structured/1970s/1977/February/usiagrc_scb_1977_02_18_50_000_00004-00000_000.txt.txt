Consider
SGA election

They're coming up fastgsGA presidential elections, that
is. Nominations are due on Thursday and ‘meet the can-
didate’ sessions will begin Sunday, March 6.

Though it seems early to begin thinking about next year,
it is necessary that leaders be nominated and selected soon
so that they may have an opportunity to intern with this
year’s president, Ruth Montgomery. That means it is
necessary to be thinking about who is going to submit
nominations.

So why worry about it? What’s the student government
good for anyway? Several things:

Though it has often been a battle, it has been demon»
strated this year that student opinion, presented collectively,
can effect changes in college policies. And though the
student government involves only a minority, SGA is still
the students' only formalized voice on campus.

Though student governments will not, very fortunately,
have reorganizations to protest every semester, there will
always be issues to which students should address thema
selves. Right now, Alumni Executive Secretary Grace
Davidson’s abrupt firing should be examined for any in-

dications about personnel management at the college as well '

as for its damaging effect on employee morale and the
concept of “the joyful community.”

Student opinion can also be important in formulating
ideas about specific proposals for new programs, along with
participation in on-going study of such things as advising
and counseling and dorm renovation.

AS well as being a Channel for student input and a think
tank for student. ideas, SGA allocates and administers
student activity fee money. Next year’s budget will total
over $80,000. Whoever is selected as president will be
involved in decisions about how much money will go to
finance concerts and movies and to support the 8&8, KDIC,
the yearbook, public events and hail funds.

Though very little seems to go on at Joint Board meetings.
SGA does deal with many aspects of student life throughout
the year.

The president is, of course, in charge of the SGA
bureaucracy. The president may also set definite goals and
directions for student government, Ultimately, the president
should be receptive to student interests, be able to pick
among them and pursue the most important and promising
concerns.

We are fortunate this year to have a president dedicated to
>making SGA work for the students. It should be our concern
that next year's president continue in the same vein.

No, not everybody is cut out to be SGA president. Not
everybody even cares about SGA. But the president can
perform an important function on this campus. Those at all
interested in the future direction of the college should
consider who they would like to see submit nominations on
Thursdayiand encourage them to do so.

open
letter

To thc editor: An Open Lelter to
President Turner and [he ltd-
ministration:

As a senior and an alumnusio
be, I am saddened and concerned
by your treatment of Grace Lang
Davidson. The abruptness of her
unexpected dismissal causes me to
wonder about your motives. 1 do
not question your right to organize
the administration of the college as
host you see fit. However, because
each member of the college
Community bears a certain amount
of responSlbility for actions taken
by the college, i must protest that
the treatment of Mrs. Davidson
has been both insensitive and
unfair. showing either an
ignorance or a simple disregard of
accepted standards at decency and
respect. Furthermore, actions like
Mrs, Davidson's dismissal can
only harm the college, calling into
doubt as they do the college's m7
tegrily as an employer What sense
of security can employees expect
when the college acts so deClSlVely
without apparent reasons”
Qualified people Will find Grinnell
College unattractive if the Climate
is to remain so autocratic

it is Wilh a sense of real disap-
pointment that I write this letter
While I entertain no illusions about
the “real world,” i certainly ex
pected a higher Standard of con-
duct from Grinnell College?

firing

insensitive

To the Editor: Some sort of
ceremony usually accompanies the
termination of responsible human
work Contracts. It eases the
transition from the known to the
unknown. It softens the blow. It
shows respect. Everybody knows
this. But there was no ceremony
for Grace Davidson.

Secretary at the Fine Arts
Building for two years, Mrs
Davidson was promoted to Alumni
Executive Secretary in June, 1976,
She started to learn her new job.
Then the “re-organization"
machine turned in her direction.

There was apparently no “would
you stay on until your contract
runs out and help train your
replacemcntiuno “we'll try to
use you some other placeunoi
even a “thanks for trying."_

So abrupt. 50 cold. No come
passion or consideration for a
person who had done her best, a
woman whose life has been in-
timately connected with Grinnell.

Wouldn’t it have been the decent
and gracious thing to do to have
thanked Mrs. Davidson publicly
ior her work? What kind of people
are responsible ior this outrageous
insensitivity? Jeanne Burklc

Thanks

Keep honors‘
program

To the Editor: SGA President Rul’
Montgomery has now publicly
aligned herself with those wishing
to abolish Grinncll’s honors
program (last week’s s & a).
Great. Amid all the ”yawns”
which Ms: Montgomery spoke oi, i
would like toadd a voice protﬁting
any proposed abolishment in this
program, Allow me to make a few
observations about this

First, while the college may
prize an attitude of learning,
dedicated to the pursuit of
knowledge as an end in itsehgs
anyone who looks upon this
statement as anything more than
an idealist ciple to be at
tained qualita ly (not quan ‘
titativelyl suffers, in my opinion,
[rum gross naivety. [think it fair to
say that Grinnell has not yet
reached the stage where we may
completely push aside practical
considerations in favor of the
loftier exalted ideals.

Secondly, Pre 'dent Mont»
gomery should 'have perhaps
quoted the passage on page 6 (not
7) of the Bulletin a littlé further.

“ . . it Welcomes the Sense of
achievement and the pleasure that
come with learning l " imagine
that! One might be led to believe
that those baser valua in life su '
as “achievement" had been
superseded in these enlightened
‘70‘S. Could it be that some of us
(all conservative freshmen. no
doubt) welcome the challenge
achievement, or for that matter,
any differentiation at all in this
place of learning populated solely
by those scoring 750 SAT‘S and 30
ACTS? i would like to suggest that
however ideologically “impure" it
may be, however animalistic
(maybe even “common?”) it
sounds, a few of us prefer. the
object of the hunt rather than the
beauty of the trail.

Ms. Montgomery further attacks
the existence of an honors progrg
on this campus because it seems
“vague" and does not Specify
requirements equally applicable in
all departments i must admit
my capacity here in Grinneil ,3
had never even occurred to met
suggest that the Art department is
essentially the Same academically
as say, the Economics department
or the Math major the same as the
English majorior is this also
“unfair segregation?" I suspect
the truth iS that they are not, and
that requirements fair or even
accepmble to one department may
not necessarily be lair or ac-
Ceptabl e to another My contenti
is that the very obscurity whit
seems to dismay President
Montgomery so (might one a -
plaud discretion?) may in fact
the very strongest argument it has
in iLs favor.

l therefore protest as strongly as
is possible against any discon»
tinuance in the honors program,
which is not, 1 repeat, not to be
taken as an argument suggesting
that it is perfect, and no changes to
it are possiblwit is in fact not. by
any means, perfect. In my opinion
the program could be made bet
leriperhaps by formulating
honors requirements applicable to
each division of the college. '7‘
honors program for one majorir
in the Science division would then
be difierent from the program
followed by one majoring in
Humanities These requirements
should be clearly specified, tic
minimum GPA requirements

alone kept the same across all four
divisions. Yet it Should be Clear to
all that the answer to this problem
is not quite that simple—it will not
go lnvay it it is ignored or
abolished. and it is not possible to
claim the question is itself invalid
if we do not understand it
