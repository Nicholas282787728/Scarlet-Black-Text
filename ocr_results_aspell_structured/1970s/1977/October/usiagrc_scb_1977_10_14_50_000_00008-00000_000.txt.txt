The Skip Day that almost wasn’t

By Dick Gilbert
and Justine Doherty

Skip Day dawned bright and
beautiful much to the delight of the
Grinnell student body. Judging
from the atmosphere throughout
the day, Grinnellians felt that the
timing couldn’t have been better.

Complete with three kegs in
central campus, students with
painted and glittered faces danced
in the Sun While other Grinnellians
listened to students performing
music and watched the antics of
various members of the Student
Government Association.

THE STUDENTS couldn’t have
been more pleased about having an
entire day off to do as they pleased.
For once, the weary pre-meds and
prevlaws were given a much
needed and deserved break.

Skip Day's history is an unusual
one. According to SGA President
Jon Neiderbach, President A.
Richard Turner initiated the event
in the spring of 1975 at his
inauguration as President. Instead
of the usual pompous ceremonies
which accompany an inauguration,
Turner requested that the students
he given a day off. The oveil
whelming success of the day
prompted the faculty, concerned
with finding a way to alleviate
academic pressure, to vote to have
a skip day once a semester. Thus,
skip Day was born with the idea of
being as spontaneous and un-
structured as possible,

NEIDERBACH said em-
phatically that although skip Day
lhis year coincided with National
Armband Day, it was totally ac-
cidental. Interestingly, Skip Day is
never planned more than two or
three days in advance. Sunday
night Neiderbach decided Wed-
nesday would be a good day. The

 

weather Service in Des Moines
predicted Clear weather for the
day. “an important part in a party
atmosphere,” Neiderbach said:
The wheels started rolling for the
Wednesday activities,

Neiderbacn's committee. con-
sisting of SGA Vieeepresident
Linda Cornelius, Student Coor-
dinator Gary Doernhoefer.
initiative Funds Chairperson Rich
Houston, and Secretary Coorr
dinatur Lori Harrison, had no idea
as to when skip day would be held
prior to Neiderbach’s actual
decision. Due to the incessant
harassing by fellow students, the
committee spread a rumor that
skip day wouldn‘t be held until
alter break. Another rumor that
Skip Day wouldn’t be on a Monday,
Wednesday or Friday also proved
false. Neiderbach rather in-
dignantly stated that “there
almost wasn’t a Skip Day because
of the overwhelming expectations
of the student body and its constant
badgering." '

NEIDERBACH expressed
amazement that no one guessed
the Wednesday date because
Tuesday afternoon groups of
students watched him unload
crates of champagne into the
form. He claims the food service,
the Pub, and certain individuals
who must be notified in advance
are the biggest leaks Thus, the
preparation began, requiring up to
fourteen hours of Neiderbach's
time on both Monday and Tuesday.

The committee‘s goal was to
keep the day as informal and
spontaneous as possible because,
as Neiderbach said, “creativity is
the key.” He felt that the day “ran
along very smoothly and suc-
cessiuily.”
