Male cagers :ri

drop three

By Russ Winick

Maybe it was the weather, 0r
finals pressure. Whatever the
reasons, Grinnell had the kind of
week that drives coaches out for
toupees and players for Jack
Daniels.

It began last Friday with a rude
reception at Lake Forest, in the
format :1 92‘59 thrashing by the
powerful Foresters, whom Grinr
nell coach Art Peterson expects to
win their division of the Midwest
Conference. The next night saw
Grinnell on the short end of an 83-62
game at the University of
Chicago’s antiquated fieldhouse.
Things weren't any better back at
Darby Tuesday night as the
Pioneers lost, 77»56._to an ex-
perienced, wellcoached Central
College contingent that may easily
win the Iowa Conference cham-
pionship.

Most of what little the players
felt like saying about thae Conr
:tests wasn‘t printable. However,
junior-guard Frank Orth did affirm
that ”we didn’t play together ofr
fensively or defensively in any of
the three games like we did against
Simpson," referring to the
Pioneers’ only victory thus for in a
1-5 season. Peterson expressed
disappointment because he,doesn’t
feel G'rinnell played as well against
those tough teams as it should
have. “We weren’t mentally
prepared,” the coach observed.

Nobody is throwing in the towel,
however. Despite the, lopsided
scores: Peterson believes the team
is improving. He is heartened by
the play of freshman center-
forward Pat Walsh, Grinnell's
leading'scorer in each of the last
three games and 5’2” swingman
Mike McCurry, another yearling.
But Peterson won’t be satisfied
until he sees more movement and
overall improvement in the or
tense, including better free throw
shooting} plus harder cone
centiation and a reduction of
mental lapses on dﬂense.

A.home game with Carleton at
7:30 tonight is next for the
Pioneers. The cagers demon»
strated‘against Simpson that’they
are capable of playing inspired
basketball. A victory over Carleton
would' be most welcome. for it
would give Grinnell a share of the

division lead for at last a month

Grinnell’s lettermen are no;

they swagger down our town’s
quiet strees. The college‘s foot—

athletes certainlvare deserving of

But what of one of Grinnell’s lesser
known teams, one which must face
the world in civilian clothing and
draw no gaping stares lrom awe-

Grinnell's bowling team?

The men’s Volleyball Club
wrapped up its play for this
semester with a strong showing at
the Hawkeyc Classic Invitational
Tournament last Saturday. The
club, coming off an unimpressive
showing the week before, earned a
as record and the consolation
bracket championship at the
Hawkeye Classic.

The tournament was split into
two founteam divisions. The
competition was set up as a round-
robin with a twogame match
against each of the teams in the
division. Grinnell was 24 after the
round~rohin ended. The top two
teams from each division went to

'were Bob (31') Taylor, Steve (the

the bottom two played in the
consolation bracket, Grinnell was
3-1 in consolation play and wound
up in ﬁrst place in that bracket.
Coach Tom Latimer was very
pleased with the results, saying,
“We were as good as any team
there. We just have to overcome
our problem of inconsistency."
That problem showed in the fact
that the club beat the eventual
tournament champions in one
game, but later lost a game to a
club with an 0-6 record. Cited by
Latimer for playing excellent
games were Mike Moody, whose
hitting was too overpowering for
most of the opponents, and Steve

Last Saturday, at the Luther
Invitational, the Grinnell
aquawomen finished in the money.
overtaking Northern Iowa in the
final minutes, the Pioneers placed
third behind power-houses
Wisconsin-LaCrosse and Luther.

The female fish leaped out to an
early lead as the 200 Medley
Relay team, composed of Nancy
DuTeau, Debbie Jalowiec, Ginny
Munoz, and Sheryl Huntoon, totally
devastated dieir rivals. However,
the lead was short-lived and the
swimmers fell back into a see-saw
battle with UNI for third place.
After Jan Walker and Carrie
Bergfalk f' ished third and fifth,
respectively, in the diving com-
petition, Kathy Keller’s third in the
100 Individual Medley set the
stage for Grinnell’s final spurt.

Down to UNI by two points with
only two evenm remaining, the
Pioneers outscored their rivals
18 to eight. In the 100 Breast,
Jalowiec and Lynn Westley
finished first and fourth. respecA
tively, and the zoo Free Relay team
of Keller, Jalowiec, Munoz, and
Huntoon finished third. Thus, the
women left Decorah with their
competitive desires almost
fulfilled. (However, they did return
to Grinnell with their stomachs
totally lull filled after “piggirlg
out" at a steak house.)

Last Monday’s duel against
Drake was postponed due to snowy
weather. With no make-up
Scheduled, the next meet is not
until after break.

Volleyballers return from Hawkeye Classic

again next January. The first home
match will be held Saturday,
Feb. 11, and will be Grinndl's first
conference tournament.
