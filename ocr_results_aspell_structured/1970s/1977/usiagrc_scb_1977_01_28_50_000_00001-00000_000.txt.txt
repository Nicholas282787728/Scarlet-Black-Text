Dentel signs while McCluskey waits

by Dave wick

Last month, Georgia Dentel
completed negotiations with the
College and signed a new three
quarter position contract, under
protest. Kathy McCluskey has not
yet signed a new contract, but has
made a verbal agreement with
Waldo Walker, Dean oi the College,
to sign a halt position contract.

Dean Waldo Walker, coma
menting on Deniers signing under
protest said, “I don’t know what
the protest means. She wasn’t
torced into signing. 1 don‘t know
why she protested.”

Walker added that he doesn’t

ticipate Dentel bringing a

wsuit against the College and he
will not worry about one until the
legal papers are handed to him.
Should that occur, the case would

handed over directly to the
allege lawyer. Dentel is being
legally advised to withhold all
comment and thus reiused to say
anything for quotation, ’

Under the new contract, Dentel's
duties encompass most of those
stated in her full time contract.
These include booking and signing
performing artists for social
events, the arranging of support
services for these artists such as

lighting and sound, and the ad-
vising oi the Movies, Concerts,
North Lounge, and Public Events
Committees,

McCluskey has verbally agreed
with Walker to sign a halt position
contract, it it meets with her ap-
proval, However, Walker has
neglected to issue her contract thus
far; therefore, McCluskey is still in
the negotiating stage. The con
tract, when' finally issued, will
basically give McCluskey the
responsibilities of teaching the
classes she now teaches as well as
maintenance of phys, ed. and
G.0.R.P. equipment, explained
Walker.

Discussing the original
reorganization decision regarding
Kathy McCluskey, Turner ex-
plained, “She was teaching more
phys. ed classes than we were
aware. These classes are the most
popular on campus," To iuliill the
curricular requirements, Mc-
Cluskey was relieved of her
G.0.R.P. duties. .

McCluskey doesn’t appear bitter
about her new status but, rather, is
interested in the success of
G.0,R.P. in particular and
recreation in general. She has been
busy trying to prepare the

G.0,R.P. program tor her
depature so that it might continue
to run smoothly.

“If we all bust our butts, we can
come up with a good program,”
she commented.

McCluskey has not brought in
legal counsel as of yet and does not
plan to unless she encounters
problems with her new contract,

Turner explained that one reason
for last semester’s attempted

reorganization was the belief that
Tom Latimer, director oi social

and recreational programs, was

“underjobbed.” As a result of
Dentel'and McCluskey's new
contracts, Latimer has received
the responsibilities of producing
the campus activities calendar in
conjunction With William
Deminoff, director of College
Relations, and supervision of
concerts, previously handled by
Dentel, as well as the direction of
G.O.R.P, [ormei‘ly directed by
McCluskey

Latimershopes McCluskey will
aid the G.0,R.P. program as a
resource person. McCluskey
herself indicated that she will act
unofficially in an advising
capacity. Although McCluskey‘s
leadership will be missed, Latimer

Kathy McCluskey

seems optimistic. “1 don’t think oneRAlwlthoutdoorinterestswill

No leads to room
ransackings, burglaries

by Trcna Cleland

A rash of dorm burglaries which
took place during Christmas
vacation has left Grinnell police
mystiﬁed and thousands of dollars
worth of audio equipment missing,

According to Susan Green Crim,
assistant director of Student Af-
iaii‘s, at least 32 students returned
to Grinnell on or around Jan. 23 to
find their rooms ransacked and
expensive equipment stolen,
Fourteen oi the burglaries
reported were in Smith alone,
while the remaining eighteen were
in Clark, Gates, Rawson, Langan,
Loose, and Mears, As [or as can be
determined. only stereos, tape
recorders, and radios were taken.
Other personal possessions, in
cluding expensive leather jackets,
watches, jewelry, and cash, were
left untouched.

Dale Hawn, director of the
Physical Plant, believes that the
thefts occurred over the Christmas
weekend. between Dec. 25 and 27,
when only one watchman was on
duty,

“At a time unknown to us, bet»
ween Friday noon and Sunday
noon, access to the dorms was
gained by breaking out windows.
On Close examination of the
buildings involved it was found
that licc S to i'onms had been
gained by removing transoms over
doors. The police were notilied, but
not having an inventory it was
impossible to delannmc what had
been taken lllltil the students

 

returned Our staff notified the
president, the dean. and the

student dean When the detective
arrived, he was assisted in a
complete tour of the area,” he said.

Hawn explained that during the
weekend after the burglaries were
discovered, the security patrol was
enlarged and men patrolled both
North and South campuses 24
hours a day. However, now that
students have returned and the
campus is well-populated, there
are no plans for additional security
either during the week or on
weekends.

David Rosenbaum. who lives in
Mears, returned from vacation to
[ind thathis room had been entered
and that his $800 Stereo was gone.
The Window to his first floor room
had been jimmied open with a
screwdriver which was left behind.
Rosenbaum theorizes that, ” . .
what happened was probably tor a
couple at weeks before break
people cased out the dorms" in
preparation {or the breakrins, No
other rooms on his floor were
disturbed.

Most, it not all, otthe burglarized
dorms were entered through loggia
windows, giving the thieves
(reedoni to walk through the halls
Phil Brown, who lives on Smith
third, also was n victim

"l lust arrived back Saturday
and went to my room . . it was
obvious that the place had been
torn apart. obvious that someone
had gone through the room . . my
stereo was gone." he said,

Apparently. as was the case in
other dorms. the thieves hurl clir
tcl‘cd the dorm through the with

 

dows and the individual room by
climbing through the transom. In
Brown’s case, they made on with
his $600 stereo. Although Buildings
and Grounds had replaced the
transoms, neither Brown nor any
of the other Victims had been in
{armed of the theits. According to
Hawn, students were not notified of
the burglaries because of the
frequency oi unreported room
changes and the possibility that
confusion would result.

Although students’ personal
belongings are not covered by
school insurance, Green Crim
believes that many of the victims
can be reimbursed through lamily
insurance policies

“The College is just not prepared
to cover students’ personal items , .
, most students should be able to
collect under their parents’
homeowners policies.” she Said.

Detective Jay Stevenson of the
Grinnell police force says that
there are no suspects in the case
and that not much more than
routine investigations could be
made in each of the rooms because
|l was not clear exactly what was
missing. \

“We didn't take fingerprints
iingerpnnts aren't that helplul it
you don’t have a suspect," he said.
Ste ‘ on also said that he is
the ung to see it the equipment
has been icnccd.

Dcleclivc Stevenson also asked
that anyone whose room was
burglarizcd and who has not yet
rcportcd it should n him at
police headquarters,
