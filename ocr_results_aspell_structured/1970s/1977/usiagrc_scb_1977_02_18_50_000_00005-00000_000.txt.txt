The Prophet pursued

by Mark s. Anderson

.Saturday night came around,
and I put my red bandana on my
big head, tucked Hegel into my
pocket, ignited the Borkum Riff in
my $25 meerschaum. and
descended upon the Loose Hall
Ball. I struck a pose, and watched
all the drugged out children per-
form for each other. The fact that
the college condones such

Qdisgusting decadence made my
head swim, and l nearly fell over
and broke my halo.

_ Don‘t turn away, please. I was

, only doing my“- Bob Aldrich

‘vimitation. Readon. lt'won’t happen
again, I promise. Actually, I was
pretty decadent that night, as were
many others who had an equally
enjoyable time. Ifeveryone does it,
then it can‘t be wrong, right? Don't
answer that, mom.

But, that isn’t the point of this
article. Nothing,

Anyway, iwas ting the men's
bathroom in theiibrary, and sat.
down to read the original works of
future poets and fascists, There
were a few of the usual jabs at
campus celebrities, limericks, lists

\of the best and the worst,
.arguments between gays and
jocks, “graffiti" spelling debates.

 

and some unusual prerNeanderthal
wall drawings. Sure, there was
more, and it would be nice to
discuss the duclod jokes, but this
newspaper is only so long, What
was most stunning was this cryptic
message: “The pestilence is soon
upon you my people, my shit. Suck
my ring or die, The choice is
yoursiThe Prophet Of Doom."
Like I said, stunning.

Also known as TPOD, this
oblique genius has been haunting
the halls and Walls of this college
as long as l have. I decided that it
was time to seek him out and learn
from him all I could before I must
leave this place. i began pursuing
him. I didn’t know where I needed
to look, but I must have been doing
something right, because I
received a note in my mailbox
saying only “D." I kept searching.
The next day, l walked into the
forum bathroom, and saw the word
“knowledge" written in excrement
on the mirror,

As you can well imagine, i had a
troubled sleep that night. I
dreamed that I was sitting at the
base of the central campus
sculpture whistling the theme song
from “Leave It to Beaver.” A dog
appeared with a roll of toilet paper

 

in its mouth I took the roll from it,
and it ran off howling. I then
unrolled the paper and found this
message: “Following the cryptic
instruction written in mirror-
letters under the seat, the novice
snorted four groundrup vivarins,
placed his head in the position of
reverence, and flushed, thereby
clearing his sinuses and invoking
the great ones name. Soon, a
blinding brightness filled the
temple, the janitor pulled the
seeker's head up, and shook him
roughly, telling him that the
library was closing. Realizing that
a true vision oi the Proph would
probably leave him a gibbering
maniac at his level of religious
enlightenment, the novice decided
to make contact with the mortal
incarnation. Fat chance." I awoke
ln the bathroom, standing in the
toilet tank with my mouth full of
toilet paper.

I took this as a warning, as
should you, dear reader.

I WILL NOT RISE TO THE
MEDIUM OF THE PRINTED
WORD—The Proph. (ed. note: The
last sentence was added after the
article was turned in to us. No one

The GrinnellslnsLondon program
has the potential for being an
exciting and innovative departure
from the conventional liberal arts
,Oeducation which is otherwise ofs

‘ fered by Grinnell College. Of
course. we all know that Grinnell is
yet in the habit of giving credit for

experiencing life However, what
Grinnell doesn't seem to recognize
is that it is possible to incorporate
the practical experience oi living
in a city, in a cultural and political
center, and in a ioreign country
into an academic framework and
have that learning experience be
both valid and valuable. The
planners and the implementers of
the Grinnellrianondon program
seemed to miss this point almost
completely in the handling oi this
year's program, If Grinnellrinr

ondon is to be successful it needs
something which will set it apart in
some way from British univer-
sities. The most obvious way to
do this is to make the program
flemble. experimental and
’responsive to the needs and wants
of its students. Otherwise, students
may as we” attend British
universities \Vllei‘c at least they
have access to the library, union
and other college facilities,

Last year we werc led to believe
that the professors. both Grinnell
and London. were planning to
utilize at least some oi the many
resources available to them in an

 

Changes suggested for
Grinnell—in-London

attempt to enhance our “book"
learning. Wealsc expected that the
topics for the courses would be
suiiiciently researched and that
the time and energy expended on
planning wouldat least be up to par
with Grinnellsinslowa. The Lands
scape in Literature class sucs
cessfully fulfilled these ex-
peciations. However, the political
science and social studies courses
fell dlsmally short of our hopes,
London, being an important
political center, is packed with
resources to which the pmfessors
might have turned in planning
their courses. For example, there
are numerous London journals
which deal with the Very topics we
were considering in these classes.
Instead we relied unnecessarily on
numerous and expensive books, It
appeared to us that many of the
courses were put together
haphazardly at best with little
insight into what resources were
available, little or no apparent
direction to the courses, and
reading lists which were unr
necessarily extensive and, in some
cases. somewhat outdated

There was a pi-oblcm with the
British professors which needs
serious consideration. It is difficult
in rctrospect to discern exactly
what it was that the majority of the
British professors n ere driving at
in their classes They never
dcfllled what it was they were
looking for from us. Consequently
there was much contusion among
studenls in these classcs‘when

,ooori opooe, open opooo open opooe

grade time rolled around. This
problem was explained away in
part by the differences between
teaching methods of the American
and British systems. however, it
was also attributable to the
inability of Grinnell to come
municate its basic goals for the
program to these professors.

These problems are not inherent
in the program but rather they are
solvable with some time, energy
and creative thinking There were
a number of constructive
suggestions made at the recent
Grinnell~insLondon meeting which
should be taken seriously by the
future planners oi the program.
Among these were the recom-
mendation for the formation of
some sort of GrinnellsinsLondon
EPC, and the recommendation for
the development oi a resource
network which could be used by
professors and students alike. We
would also like to recommend that
a paid position be created for
administrating the program This
would ensure that there is someone
with whom the program receives
top priority and who will take full
responsibility for the problems
which may occur

New proicssors should be
required to arrive in London at
least two months before the
beginning ol the program in order
to establish contacts. Scout out
resources and incorporate these
fully into their course plans It does
no one any good for the classes to
begin discovering these things
halfway through the semester

We hope that the people planning
the future Grinnellsln~L0ndon
programs will not take these
comments merely in the light of
“Oh. you know, all Grinnell
students are complainers,” as one
prolcssor was heard remarking at
the recent GrinncllsillsLondon
meeting Rather we hope that they
will be seen as well-thought out,
constructive criticisms regarding
a good idea which sccmcd to get
lost ill a lack of continuity, lack of
creativity and a lack of basic
commitment to the incorporation
oi the “London experience" into
the Gl‘|nliCll-lllrLonan academic
framework.

 

 

 

Short timer’s
attitude

by Tom Panzer

In the Navy they call it a “short
timer's attitude." Three and a half
years ago I was the victim of a
severe case oi this commonplace
malady. As the time approached
for my departure from the fun and
games oi Navy duty I spent less
and less energy working, and vast
amouns of time on the cultivation
of a tremendous indifference to
everything connected with that
branch of the armed forces.

The symptoms of a “short
timer‘s attitude" are obvious to the
victim and all those around him. I
witnessed many cases before I was
struck down myself. Work is either
left undone or is pushed on to the
new guy who is transferred to take
the short timer’s place. During
working hours endless games of
hangman and ticstac-toe are
played with the boys instead of any
useful work being accomplished.
Of course to the short timer the
phrase “useful work” is
meaningless, because he has
concluded long ago that any type of
work in the Navy is totally useless
and without any redeeming social
value. When the Chief is not around
the short timer spends his time,
depending on his inclinations, with
a game of solitaire, a new issue of
Playboy, or, if he has intellectual
pretensions. with something a bit
more literary and a bit less pic-
torial.

After working hours the short
timer goes slightly berserk, The
sight of the barracks and all those
uniforms nauseates him. The bars
in town send out a call that draws
him nearly every night. Because
female companionship oi any iorm
has been nonexistent for a period
that seems like a lifetime to the
short timer, he constantly falls in
love with bar maids in lousy bars
around the city. Since each
waitress has seen a few thousand
short timers pass through (and
pass out), none are very impressed
by his romantic protestations.

The last night the short timer

pends in the Navy he gets roaring

drunk. puts the convertible top
down on his car, and drives around
the city gazing at the stars, Luckily
he does not kill himself, and
arrives safely at Grinnell College a
few days later with a liver that is
slowly recovering irom the shock
of all that alcohol consumed during
his final military days,

A number oi things have hap
pened in the past three and a hall
years and all were very dissimilar
to my avy experiences. Even so, I
now find myself with another
classic case of “short timer’s at-
titude." The symptoms are,
however, somewhat different this
time around, although there are
some similarities. I still indulge in
occasional solitaire games.
Playboy still has its obvious at-
tractions, and I do even read a
book for one of my courses now and
then,

Academic work has lost much of
its charm for me, although I must
honestly admit that I have never
overworked myself during my
years at Grinnell, Many books
have gone unread and many poorly
written papers have been given to
proiessors, who are fated to peruse
far too many such literary aborr
tions. My “short timer's attitude”
makm it difﬁcult, if not ims
possible, to take academic work
seriously, 7

Female companionship has been
available for the last three and a
half years, but in many ways it
causes more problems than a total
absence of women. The insoluble
problem of the sexes remains a
central concern of existence, but
my relapse into the “attitude"
reminds me that a satisfacmry
resolution is probably an im-
possible dream. sol refuse to tail '
in love with any more bar maids.
Besides. Grinnell has a rather
limited number of bar maids, and
the man operating Duffy’s usually
fails to arouse any passionate
notions on my part.

On the other hand, drinking
remains a very real maniiestatioii
of the “attitude.“ My consumption
of alcohol is gradually escalating,
and it may very well end in a
crescendo of drunkeness not unlike
my final Navy days. Duffy's is
slowly becoming a second home for
me, Any Grinnell student in the
throes of the “attitude" should
become intimately acquainted
with this fine institution. Duffy‘s
must be one of the best kept secrets
in town, because very few college
students are seen within its walls
. . . but I am beginning to wander
off to a different topic entirely.

My. current case oi the “at-
titude” differs entirely from the
original inlection in one important
aspect. My final Navy days were
ones of hope because I had a
destination when I departed, the
campus oi Grinnell College, and I
was also leaving a life that I'hated.
Now I have no definite plans for my
iuture. which obviously leads to a
degree oi uncertainty and ap
prehensiveness. Frankly, I do not
care to leave the secure existence
at Grinnell College. In my final
Navy days I wanted to forget a
distasteful past, while in my final
college days I want to forestall an
unpromising future.

No matter what happens bet
ween now and the end of the year
(as I finish this column the 100 days

party is only hours away—more

alcoholic lubrication) I have a
feeling the conclusion will be the
same as three anda half years ago.
The last night I am in Grinnell I
will get roaring didnk at puiiy's,
put down the convertible top on the
car, and take a late night drlve
around town. One thing will be
different. however. I won't be able
to stare at the stars because it will
be raining.
