Mixed with rock music

Group finds old-time fun at fair

by Mark Mayer
and Toni Arenberg

From the brightly lit Midway
lined with sleazy freak shows and
two-bit carneys hawking their
rigged games to the steamy
livestock barns filled with
bellowing animals and their
anxious hopeful handlers, the 1977
Iowa State Fair proved to be as
diverse and alive as Iowa itself.

Entrance into the fair was
achieved only atter lengthy and
careful negotiation of the mama
moth parking lot that was turned
into a veritable swamp by con
tinuous rains and the tires of in»
numerable pickups,

AFTER a quick $2.50 to get into
the fairgrounds, we tound our-
selves smack on the Midway
surrounded by flashing, roaring
carnival rides with such exotic
names as the “Yo-yo,” the
“Twister" and a diabolical looking
machine called the “Super Loop"
that was sure to give your breake
fast a chance for a repeat perr
iormance.

Mingled with the rides was an

Judging from the large namher of
people purchasing tickets, P T.
Barnum was perhaps a better
judge of people than we give him
Credit for.

Leaving the Midway, where it
seemed the whole world was for
sale, we strolled to the livestock
barns. The transition was im-
mediate and abrupt.

The barns, sprawling, perv
manent brick and mortar buildings
dating mostly from the 1930's. were
quiet and peaceful. The ground
was covered With fresh Sawdust
and straw; the air was predictably
pungent.

THE CATTLE barn was full of
various sizes, colors and breeds of
cowsiunbelievably huge beasts
when you stand next to them. The
sacks of milk hanging from some
of the cows seemed enormous and
looked a bit painful. Bags oi Kent
Kattl Bulk high protein feed were
everywhere. The only unime

rigged) by a motley but vocal

Crowd.

“Hey there hotshot, win a prize

STILL further down the Midway
were the freak shows. One dollar
got you in to see AnnrMarie (the
twoeheaded lady), Vampira (the
lady who can grow her hair so long
so fast that you can’t see anything
when she takes her clothes off),
Richard (“the world’s smallest
living man") as well as a collection

pressive sight in the barn was the

champion bull of Iowa who
declined to wake up for our Visit.

He looked small,

Unfortunately, all oi the hog
competition was over by the time
we arrived at the Fair so the Swine
Earn (the largest of the livestock
barns, a mammoth structure with
over 1,000 stalls) was almost
empty of pigs Even the special
stall designed for the largest boar
in iowa was empty except for a
sign noting that this year's
champion weighed a mere half ton.

THE HORSE barn, however,
was full of activity and across the
street in the Livestock Pavilion,
the Quarterhorse Show finals were
getting underway,

With its circular rink, organ
music and banners. the show
looked like a hockey game, We
were badly out of place there,
Nearly everyone wore some kind of
cowboy hat and looked liked he had
Spent his life around horses, We
couldn’t tell a good horse ride from
a bad one.

There was an established pattern ‘

for each of the horses. They trotted
straight into the rink, came to an
abrupt halt and began stepping
backwards. The riders, who
ranged from a young boy to a man

in a suit and tie, were giving ,

commands to their horses, but it
was hard to tell how. The horses
then took on in circular gallops.
There were a few other
maneuvers, including an im-
mediate stop from a full gallop. It

didn‘t look like the horses legs 1

were made for that sort of thing,

AFTER about. ten rides Within a
particular class of horses, the
announcer said the result would be
given momentarily. Soon, a voice
came slowly over the speaker. “We
have a Gold Malibu Classic]. .”
Our first thought was that a Gold
Malibu Classic horse had won
Actually, a Gold Malibu Classic
car had its lights on outside. The
winner was the first mount we had
seen. The horse and rider came out
for a quick photo session.

Though we didn’t learn much
about western riding, we did learn
one thing: horses are magnificent
animals. Strong, yet graceful, and
almost perfectly coordinated. Not
once during a gallop did it seem
that a horse needed more than one
leg on the ground at any time.

WHILE most of the animal
shows concerned the tour major
groups—cattle, horses, swine and
sheep—there were also contests for
geese, ducks, chickens, pidgeons,
Sheepdogs and even one for cats.

Tucked away under the Grand-
stand and thus ignored or
overlooked by most visitors to the
Fair was the Textile and Culinary
exhibit combining in one large
display some of the most
remarkable creations in lowa. The
textiles Showed good taste and the
food, we were sure, tasted good.

THE FOOD stretched forever on
long wooden display tables. it
looked like the world’s largest
family reunion was about to begin:

vegetables of all types, preserves,
jams, jellies, butters, fruits,
candies, muffins, buns, breads of
every shape, size and texture,
cinnamon buns, brownies, and
more cakes and pies than the
imagination could comprehend
We wondered who you had to know
to be a judge at one of these things.

From the number of blue (first
place) ribbons she received, Mrs.
Keith Phillips of Centerville must
he the best cook in the state, if not
the world We counted five firsts
and an innumerable number of
seconds and thirds for her. If we
ever ate her cooking, that is what
we‘d have: innumerable Seconds
and thirds.

The cooking prizes did not go to
women only. Robert Davis, irom
no where else but Grinnell, won
two blue ribbons.

THE TEXTILE display wasn't
quite as spectacular though there
were a couple of beautiful patch
work quilts that caught our

 

attention. A handstitched quilt
depicting all titty states won iirst
prize,

From there we went to the
Agriculture Building, a huge
auditoriurnrtype building cram-
med with booths displaying the
iinest produce in lowa: corn,
wheat, oats, barley, soy beans;
bushels of apples, pears, plums
and grapes; stalks of celery and
rhubarb; squash, muskmclons,
pumpkins and some huge water
melons that probably weighed over
one hundred pounds. Everything
was on open display. The people in
charge must have been very
trusting,

ALSO IN the Agriculture
Building were elaborate displays
sponsored by such groups as the
Iowa Egg Council, the iowa Pork
Producers Assoc, and the Iowa
Beet Packers Association. The
lowa Dairymen's Association even
had a fullesized cow molded out of
butter.

Fresh fudge was being cooked
somewhere down on the main floor
and the smell, mixing with the
many varied smells of the produce,
was intoxicating a sort of aromatic
ambi'osia.

Alter touring the voluminous
food exhibit and the Agriculture
Building, our appetities were in a
state somewhere between eX'

As daylight began to fade, we
ambled over to the main grand- '
stand for a Fair-ending concert by
The Outlaws and Kansas. The
crowd was noisy. certainly ene.

There seemed to be no one over 25.

throughout the crowd.

And at the close. like magic,

concert was over.
