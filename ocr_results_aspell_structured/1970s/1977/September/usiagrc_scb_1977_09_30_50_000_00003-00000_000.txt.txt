Tide of activism washes over Kent State

Editor’s note: The following is an
account or the history leading up to
the Sept, 24 demonstration at Kent
State and of the events that OCA
cured on that day. It is written by
Rob Henak, Carrie James, Kurt
Schroeder and Jim Stuart, all of
whom participuLed in the
demonstration.

On Thursday, September 20.
construction began on the new
Kent State University gym annex,
l being built on Blanket Hill, the site
of the May 4, 1970 killings of four
student antiawar protesters by the
Ohio National Guard.

Last Saturday, at a demon-
stration called by the May 4th

Yet, after iunds were approved
in March, 1974, Kent State
University administrators ap-
proved the Blanket Hill site. Ac-
cording to a May 4th Coalition
member, the site was pushed
through by Health and Recreation
Dean Erickson without the
knowledge of faculty or students.
Opposition to the site was strong
among the faculty It was almost
certain that, if allowed, the faculty
would have Voted to move the gym,
Students were not informed of this
decision until the summer of 1976.

SINCE the 1970 killings, students
have been calling for the establish-

 

 

 

Coalition, 5,000 students and young
working people came from across
the country to protest the building
of the gym on this site. Among
those demonsmating were rive
Grinnell students: Will Gleason,
Rob Henak, Carrie James, Kurt
Schroeder, and Jim Stuart.

GENERALnlans for building the
gym date rrom the mid-issue. In'
1966 and 1969, land was bought for
the future construction of the gym,
In all, seven sites, including
Blanket Hill, were considered. But
in March, 1974, Kent State
University President Glen Olds
announced his opposition to the
Blanket l-lill site. in addition, a
plan had been established in 1963 to
leave as much open space as
possible on the campus.

Those demands, which remain the
Coalition's major goals, are: to
move the gym; establish a not
business as usual policy on May 4
in memory of those killed and to
commemorate war resistance; to
dedicate the four unnamed
buildings to slam students; and
to gain official university
recognition of the injustices done,

TllE Coalition then joined “Tent
City” protesters, already do
cupying Blanket Hill, in an effort to
stop construction, This occupation
lasted for over 90 days. it ended
July 12, when 193 protesters were
arrested, including Sandra
Scheuer‘s parents (Scheuer was
one of those killed), Alan Cantora’s
entire family (Cantora was
wounded in the shootings), and
Dean Kahler, who is paralyzed as a
result of wounds received on May
4, 1970. On July 29, 62 protesters
who had reoccupied the site were
arrested.

Coalition lawyers attempted to
block construction through the

- courts, arguing that the site should

remain untouched, pending the
conclusion of the civil suit filed by
the parents or the slain students
against the state of Ohio and its
governor, the national guard and
university officials. They also
claimed the site should remain
untouched while the federal
government studied the possibility
of declaring the site a National
Historical Landmark. However,
Supreme Court Justice William
Brennan refused to block con
struction, thereby reversing an
earlier decision in favor of halting
construction.

ON September II. 400 Kent
students tore down the fence
surrounding the site as part or a
demonstration to build support for
the September 24 demonstration,

Last Saturday, September 24, a
spirited group of 5,000 protesters,
showing the nationwide opposition
tothe Blanket Hill site, gathered to
accuse the Kent State University
administration of attempting to
obliterate the memory of the slain
students and of violent repression
of antiwar sentiment, Speakers
included Alan Canfora and radical
attorney William KunsLler. Can-
fora and others emphasiwed that
the Coalition was not relying on the
courts to win its fights, but on “the
mass struggle of the people"
Kunstler defined the lawyer's role
in the struggle as providing a delay
tactic by exploiting contradictions

in the system and legal battle.
There was a small group of
counterrdemonstrators and
neutrals saying, “Build our gym,
We've heard enough lies."

FOLLOWING the rally, the
protesters marched to the four
unnamed buildings and dedicated
each to one of the slain students,
sprayrpalnting the student’s name
and the slogan: “We will never
forget and never forgive ” The
Music and Speech Center was
dedicated to Scheuer; the library
was dedicated to Jeffery Miller;
the business building to William
Schroeder; and the art building to
Allison Krause.

The marchers chanted slogans
such as “Long live the spirit of
Kent and Jackson State,” “The
people, united, will never be
defeated.” and “One, two, three.

‘lour, what are we out here righting

for? Move the gym, move the gym,
move the gym, now.” The mar-
chers then advanced onto Blanket
Hill,‘ture down the six-foot chain
link fence, and stormed the cone
struction site, while the police
videotaped the scene,

TllE police videotaped the scene
in the hopes of making iden-
tifications at a later dattkif

arrests were called ior~rather
than making arrests immediately,
which might have touched off
violence The protesters wore
masks to avoid being identified as
well as to defend against the
possrble use of tear gas Such a
possibility did exist, since the
entire protest was emotionally
charged,

Once at the site, the [our
demands of the Coalition were
again proclaimed and the
demonstrators voluntarily left the
construction site. The march then
returned to the library for con-
cluding speakers and dispersed,
promising to return on October 24
for another demonstration and
possible occupation of the site.

THE large turnout at Saturday’s
demonstration showed that the
fight to halt construction of the
gym is not over, but is rapidly
growing. The movement is not only
among students, but has strong
support from workers and
minorities as well, Many of the
demonstrators viewed this
struggle, along with struggles
against apartheid and of \vorkers
trying to retain control or their

 

unions, as the first wave of a new
tide of American radical political
activism.

Decision upheld

Joint Boards voted last Wed-
nesday night to uphold its decision
to rescind its prior ratification of
the four student members of the
Residence Hall Advisory Com-
mittee.

The decision to uphold, which
passed by a 16-2 margin, means
that the hall committee currently
has' no student members and is
without a quorum.

The vote came on a proposal by
Linda Cornelius, SGA Vice
President, to allow all current
student members of the committee
to Continue their terms while
nominating a new student to
represent South Campus on the
committee.

Cornelius's proposal was
necessitated by the fact mat the
current student members of the
committee do not fulfill the
representation guidelines that are
found in the Student Handbook.
These guidelines specify that four
students should be selected to the
Committee with one student
representing north campus, one
representing south campus, and
one representing college owned off-
campus housing. The regulations
also call for one at-large student
member.

Prior to the vote, Assistant Dean
of Students Susan Crim spoke in

 

favor of Cornelius’s proposal,
Stating that she felt comfortable
with Cornelius’s proposal. In
urging adoption, she emphasized
the need for the committee to get
underway in its task of reviewing
and lanning hall renovations,

Of-campus rep Doug Spitz,
however, spoke against the
compromise measure, saying that
it would not represent offrcampus
students. He also expressed the
belief than an off-campus
representative on the committee
could be found.

After the meeting, Crim ema
phasized the necessity of quickly
finding student representatives for
the committee.

“I asked me Joint Boards to have
the interviewing team committee. .
select the p itions and Joint
Boards to confirm them as soon as
possible so that the committee’s
work is not delayed,” she said.

The SGA committee responsible
for selecting students to this
committee selected four north
campus students. in violation of the
above guidelines. in spite of the
fact that there was one applicant
for the South Campus position.
Because of this violation, the Joint
Boards voted 13-5 in favor of
rescinding its original con- .
firmation of the four student
members.
