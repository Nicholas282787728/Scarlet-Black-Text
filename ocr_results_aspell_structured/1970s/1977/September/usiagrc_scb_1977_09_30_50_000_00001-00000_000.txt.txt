Joint Boards adopt
portfolio statement

By Tom Pantea

Wednesday night SGA approved
a statement on Grinnell College’s
investments in companies doing
business in South Africa. This
statement calls for the College to
use its investment portfolio to
being economic pressure against
the South African government’s
policy of apartheid.

According to the SGA statement.
SGA believes that the College
should in the future carefully
consider its moral and ethical
commitments when making
decisions regarding stock in-
vestments and proxy votes.

in response to this statement,
SGA unanimously approved
the following requests:

1) That the College release to the
campus community signiiicant
information concerning en~
dowment funds invested in come
paniﬁ and foundations that do
business in or trade with South
Africa.

2) That the College’s trustees
distribute to the campus com»
munity a statement concerning the
College’s support for an end to the
apartheid system in South Africa.

3) That the College support or
introduce stockholder’s resolutions
at the annual meetings of coma
panies in which U16 college owns
stock, mandating immediate
compliance with United Nations
economic sanctions and an im
mediate end to all business tran-
sactions in and with South Africa.

4) That the College, when
deciding upon future invesunents
and proxy votes, carefully consider
the implications of its actions in

light of the college's public com-
mittments to a moral and just
world, and also in light of the
opinions of the college community
on relevant issues.

An additional point was debated
and finally tabled unﬁl a future
date. The point is a request from
SGA that the College sell its stock
in all companies in which the

College's stockholder resolutions'
are not approved and that continue .

to violate United Nations economic
sanctions against South Africa
after a reasonable period, ie one
and a half to two years.

Originally Mark Sherinian
moved that the above request be
completely struck from the
proposal, an amendment that
ended in deieat, Rich Caplan then
moved thatthepointbetabled until
further information could be ob»
tained on the extent of the College
investments in South African
related companies Some of this
information, if obtained at all,
would not be forthcoming until
after the Board of Trustees gives
its approval for revealing the
portfolio’s contents, This in
formation cannot he nhtainad until
the November Trustee meeting
Caplan’s amendment passed by a
margin of two votes, 13710-1.

Jon Neiderbach. SGA president
and one of the major backers of the
proposal, feels the unanimous
approval by Joint Boards of four of
the five points indicates strong
desire that a firm stance be taken
by the College toward its moral
responsibilities as a stockholder
with holdings in South Africa.

By Dan Blum

With a history of involvement in
the antiwar and prison reform
movements as well as a long
career in the ministry, the liie oi
Porter French reflects a con-
tinuing. conscious devotion to
improving the condition of his
fellow human beings.

served an internship in a
Massachussetts hospital, during

working there. After he completed
the internship, an opportunity

PETERS stated no minors
would be allowed to remain in any
place of amusement or business
during these hours. Any Grinnell
College student under the age of 18
caught violating this ordinance
would be brought to the police
station, then taken back to the
college. A letter would be Written
to his or her parents stating the
circumstances under which the
student was apprehended. A
second offender would be taken to
his or her resident adviser and a
third offender would be taken to a
juvenile officer.

Use of automobiles by minorsi
either as passengers or driveisA
would also be curtailed by the
proposed ordinance during the
seven hour curfew period. Minors
traveling within the city limits or
whose trips originated in Grinnell
could be stopped and subject to the
provisions of the ordinance.

lN particular, the ordinance
would curtail the activities of one
distinct group of townspeople and
students: those who cruise the area
and “scoop the loop." City At-
torney Don Schild commented that
the amount of traffic during the
time of the curfew should
significantly decrease because
“kids from other'towns with
curfews cruise around Grinnell,
since we are one of the few towns in
the vicinity without one."

Exceptions to the curlew rule
would exist, however. Those
persons travelling to and from
church, municipal and school
functions would be exempt as
would minors whose jobs
necessitated breaking oi the
curfew. The ordinance would also
exempt travellers passing through
the city without a stopping point in
Grinnell.

(‘l'l‘lNG rising rates of van-
dalism, Peters commented that the
purpose oi lhe ordinance uould be
to try and curb Ihcsc offenses
Schild added that most such
vandalism occurs in the \‘lcillity of
schools and parks.

Considering the effectiveness of

 

prepares curfew law

the proposal, Schild said, “1 cerr
tainly don't think that the curfew
would solve the problems for two
reasons. First of all, it's not going
to be able to Control all juveniles
and all crime caused by juveniles.
And secondly, a lot of the problems
that citizens are concerned with
now are caused by adults"

KEGARDLESS of his
unidealistic appraisal of ordinance
effectiveness, Schild commented
that “At this time. I support it." He
feels that most of the Grinnell
citizens back the curfew, but adds
that “it is a tool for certain family
situations. You have to approach
the problem from all avenues. This
is a partial solution to a large
problemt” Peters stated that
“Grinnell citizens are in favor of it
because vandalism is increasingly
high during the summer and it then
becomes a police issue.

When asked about the possible
infringement of personal rights,
Schild replied that “it Will not
affect minors’ rights. The courts
would hold up the ordinance. If a
person violates this, they're
violating a city ordinance. it would
he the city attorney’s office that
would handle the case."

ALTHOUGH the proposed or—
dinance for the time being, would
be strictly enforced and all
violators brought to the station,
Peters says that “When things cool
down, [will ask the council to kick
out the ordinance There's not one
member oi the council who really
wants the curfew.”

Schild feels that it is necessary to
regulate and control the problem.
without unnecessarily curtailing
activities that are not part of the
problem, Cllief Peters commented
that “I have always received good ’
cooperation out of the college,”
adding that he feels lhc police
department Will not have any
problems with Grinnell College
students Attorney Sciilld said. "It
is unfortunate that we have to limit
the activities of the college
students under iii since they are
not part of the evil."
