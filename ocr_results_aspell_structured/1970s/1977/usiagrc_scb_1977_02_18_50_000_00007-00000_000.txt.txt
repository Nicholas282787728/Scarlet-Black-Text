*Varsityr downed;
,second JV win

by Mike Salsicli

Last weekend, the men's
basketball team traveled eastward
to Illinois to play three Midwest
Conference rivals and lost the
Contests

On Friday night. the Pioneers
met the Monmouth Scots in a high
scoring game, The Pioneers lost,
116 - 90.

Originally, coach Art Peterson's
crew planned to shut off Mon~

O outh's inside game. The team did
.n fairly good job of this but Mons
mouth rose to the occasion and
began scoring effectively from the

. outside.

As the Pioneers adapted to this,
the Scots' two big men, Andy Sottos
and Roger Sanders, went to work.
By game‘s end. the two had netted
24 points apiece.

It is obvious from the score that
Grinnell's offense was clicking that
night. The Pioneer's attack had
four men in double figures. Senior
Paul DeLaney put in an out»
standing effort, scoring at poins.
Scott Lewis netted 14, Roy Shepard
l2 and Carl Warner ten,

Saturday. the Scarlet and Back
traveled a short distance to
Ga lesburg to play the Knox College

Eiwashers. Grinnell dropped the
game. 10188.

The Pioneers played a strong

first half. After allowing the op-
,nents a 1072 lead, the Pioneers
ought back and kept It dose. In the
first half, the Pioneers had a 50 per
cent shooting average, compared
to Knox’s 46 per cent, but the op-
ponents got off nine more shots
than Grinnell and led at halftime.
49-45.

The second halt did not go as well
for the Pioneers as they were
outscored, 5843.

DeLaney again played a superb

 

game as he pumped in 25 points, 18
oi these in the first half. Bill Knox,
pushed into a starting role because
of the absence of Gunnar Thors due
to sickness, responded well as he
scored 13 points and pulled down
six rebounds.

On Wednesday, the Pioneers bit
the dust again as they went down to
defeat for the 18th time, at the
hands of the Coe Kohawks, 98nd

The story of the game was all too
familiar to the Grinnellians. The
team played an excellent first half,
and seemed to have the cagers
lrom Cedar Rapids at bay. With
6:07 showing on the first half clock,
Roy Shepard pumped in a 2orfooter
that put the Scarlet and Black on
top. (1023,

From that point, things began to
go downhill for Grinnell. In the
second hall. the Kohawks began to
slowly pull away. An aggressive
deiense and an exciting offense
featuring overhead dunks sparked
the opponents in the second half.

The team has three more games
remainingthis season, two of these
being home contests. The Pioneers
play Cornell at 7:30 pm. tomorrow
in Darby, lowa Wesleyan on
Tuesday at Mt, Pleasant and then
return home for the final game,
against the University of Chicago,
on Feb. 26.

The junior Varisty pulled off
another victory as it edged
Coe's JV. 9997, The game was a
thriller from buzzer to buzzer, as
the team extended its streak to
two, The JV'S powerful offense
wrecked havoc on the Kohawks as
four players scored in the double
figures. Jon Chazen had a spec
tacular game as he netted 29
points. Joe Kingma scored 20, Phil
Guttman 15. and Jeff Greenberg
14 The JV: record stands at 243,

Women
by Sur- iienken
and Patricia Muller

The women’s indoor track team
ran a non~scoring dual meet
with Central Friday. As expected
for a first effort, the times showed
a need for improvement, but in
many cases they showed a high
degree of potential. Thus far, the
women have benelited most from
the experience of running together
as a team.

Over the past week, the women
have been working hard in practice
in anticipation of another non-
scoring dual with Central,
scheduled to be run in Conjunction
with the men's meet tonight. Coach
Dick van Scotter is expecting
steady improvement in his squad
as the Season progresses,

Grinnell
trio reaches
nationals

by Bob Meyer

Coach Mo Hunt believes that this
year’s Grinnell wrestling squad is
the “best team since the cham-
pionship team of ’65~'66,” His belief
arises from the fact that three
Grinnell wrestlers have already
qualified for nationals. Hosea
Engram (8-2), Richard Lee (114-1)
and Gordon Stacey (ism expect to
be traveling to nationals with
perhaps one to three other Grinncll
grapplers. Hunt thinks Raul
Cintra~Leite (190), Rich Corrigan
(153), David Greenwald (118) and
Harvey Pegues thyywt.) have
excellent chances of placing in the
upcoming Midwest Conference
Meet, which would allow them to
enter nationals.

Last Saturday, the University of
Chicago was smashed by the
strong Pioneer team, 4211. Hunt
admitted that Chicago did not offer
the Grinnell grappleis much of a
challenge. Grinnell's 42 points are
the most recorded by a Pioneer
wrestling team in the last eleven
years.

Grinnellscored 18 of its points on
three forleis, Co—captain Engram
(167), Lee (1587 and Pegues pinned
their opponents and won lb more
points for the Pioneer squad,
Engram's match lasted only so
seconds and Pegues pinned his
opponent in less than two minutes.
Corrigan and co—captain Stacey

Tomorrow, the squad travels to
Northfield to Wrestle its last dual
meet of the season, against
Carleton. Hunt looks forward to a
victory, which would give the
Pioneer wrestlers a 545-0 record
for the ymr. This would be the best
record a Grinnell wrestling team
has compiled Since the cham-
pionship squad of '65-’56,

Men lose
first outings

by Tim Caver

The Grinnell volleyball Club
team opened its initial season in
Macomb, 111., last Saturday by
losing to Graceland, Western
Illinois and the University of Iowa.
The team did well, although it did
not win a game, The only match
the team was really out of was the
match against Graceland, which it
last, 1571, 1541.

Because coach Tom Latimer
wanted to give the entire team
experience, the Grinnell junior
varsity played the third game of
every match. The JV fared little
better than the varsity, losing all of
its games

Starters on the varsity were
Dave Blough, Eric Edwalds, Steve
Fernstrom, Neal Fleming, Mike
Moody and Peter Gerstenberger,
with Guy Blaylock, Mark Peterson
and Chuck Platter coming in as
substitutes

other varsity losses were the,
15's agains WIU “A,” 15-7, 15-9
against WlU “l3" and 15-7. 156
against Iowa. The team's next
competition is March 12 against
Carleton, Drake, Iowa State and
the University of Minnesota, at
Lamoni, 1a.
