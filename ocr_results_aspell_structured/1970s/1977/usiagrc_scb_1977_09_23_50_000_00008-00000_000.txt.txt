The life, the breathless
inimitability of dance are not
expended through performance
alone. This pulsating uniqueness is
the dancers themselves. Such
energy and emotion showed up
vividly in a discussion with
members of the American Ballet.

Between applying make-up,
dressing and limben‘ng for Sun-
day’s performance, these artists
were wonderfully enthusiastic
about sharing their experiences in
dance. They displayed a gracious
sense of family atmosphere
among themselves and shared this
with visitors.

THOMAS Banasiak, Larry Hunt
and Roberto Medina are members
of the “family." They first
discussed the composition of the
American Ballet. Besides the two
regular members of the company,
guest artists are invited to perform
with them. For the Grinnell per-
formances, Suzanne Farrell and
Peter Martins were the scheduled
pair.

Roberto explained that Martins
was unable to appear due to a back
injury. John Prinze, he continued,
Was then contacted on short notice
and was asked to perform with the
company. The particular version
of “Waltz Fantasy” which Prinze
danced at Grinnell was
choreographed for him by George
Ballanchine.

THE COMPANY had some
minor mishaps during Saturday’s
performance. Approximately eight
minutes of a number were lost
when the tapes had to be changed
after an amplifier blew out. The
trio of dancers said they merely
improvised until they became
reoriented with the music and
then finished Hie ballet. In ad
dition, the ceiling of Roberts
Theatre was leaking which
distracted and dampened the
audience. '

Asked if these technicalitia
upset the company, Roberto
replied that “everything is an
experience (and these misforr
tunes) add a little salt to things.”
He pointed out that “the kids back
stage from the town and college
.were tremendously helpful,” He
recounted that when fighting a
cold, he was attended to in the
wings by a Grinnell student who
brought him orange juice. So, all
things considered, their time here
was enjoyable, they said.

ALL THREE went on to praise
the Grinnell audience, sounding
much like the cover of a review
magazine. Larry exclaimed that it
was “a wonderful audience!”
Roberto was impressed by the
Saturday audience’s per-
severance with the dripping
ceiling. Thomas applauded the
crowd with a “Bravo”. claiming it
as “the best we’ve had on this
tour,” They felt that they were 50
well received because “dance is
becoming a growing art that
people are enjoying and becoming
aware of.”

As dancers, they are aware of
many things that must be
sacrificed for the theatre. They
listed money, free time, lovers,
food tcspecially tor the women)
and “every other thing you can
think 0!“ as secondary priorities.

CONSEQUENTLY. Larry said,
“your best friend is pain and you

learn to deal with physical
problems. You‘re never off work.
You have to be alert all of the time
and you‘re tired all of the time."
Thomas emphasized that “you
have to alter your entire body
structure to enter the realm of
classical ballet." Roberto added, “
. . . you learn to respect other
people’s bodies as well (as your
ownt"

In rendering advice to young
aspirants, they maintained that
one must be realistic about dance.
“Nothing is ever easy and you have
to face that: If you know and accept
that, you can live With it the rest of
your life.” Larry pointed out that
“it‘s not a glamorous life like you
hear about movie stars. The
glamour is in the performance."

Suzanne Farrell

you perform, it's nice. It doesn’t
happen very often, but i felt that it
did Saturday night,”

ROBERTO described it a little
more metaphorically: “I like to
visualize music . , . my body is my
instrument.”

It seemed ﬂ'ley could have talked
all night about their profession, but
an audience was waiting and they,
as finely tuned instruments, were
ready to turn the lovely strains of
their individual expressions into an
enchanting orchestra of
movement.

THE YOUNG laly Roberto,
Larry and Thomas supported that
night, Suzanne Farrell, is as
polished off stage as she is
mesmerizing on stage. She
graciously and eloquently

different influences which
Ballanchine and Bejart have upon
her as an artist. Ballanchine, she
feels, “allows more freedom of
interpretation, though neither is
too restricting. (But) l am myself.
I take on the color of the person l‘m
dancing with and try to com-
pliment that Color.”

WHEN ASKED if she preferred
one dance form over another, she
replied, “I like everything. It
would be terrible to do the same
thing all the time. For example, I
couldn’t do 1,000 performances of
‘Hello Dolly.’ ”.

Farrell has danced With other
partners besides Martins, but
speaks very highly of their work
together, She remarks that they
“havea nice relationship. My trust
gives him conlidence and we’re
very supportive of each other."
Among her other partners has been
Edward Vilella of the New York
Ballet.

FARRELL feels she is at an
especially exciting juncture in her

While she would have liked to perform a classical
piece which is the style she is renowned for, she

rather mischievously added, ”It’s fun to play tricks

on the audience.”

 

Cautioned Roberto, “You should
dance for yousell, never anyone
else because you can never make
anyone happy unless you're happy
with yourself."

PART OF reality in the
professional world is working ltHZ
hours a day. Actually, six to eight
hours are spent in dance alone.
However, this company does not
carry a large personnel staff and
the dancers must also run through
sound and lighting systems and
check costumes and technical
cues.

What then, makes it all Worth-
\vhile‘.7 All three were caught up
in this topic because for each,
dance “Is so personal.” Larry
commented, "If you can find even
one person in the audience who
understands What you're feeling as

discussed her career Saturday
after having finished her solo,
“Bolero,” choreographed for her
by Maurice Bejart and substitued
into the program due to Martins’
absence.

While she would have liked to

perform a classical piece, which is
the style she is renowned for, she
rather mischievously added, ”It’s
fun to play tricks on the audience.”
(This performance of “Bolero,” by
the way, was the first time it had
been presented outside Bejart’s
company).

FARRELL explained that
“Bolero” was an unusual oc-
currence because most solos are
Slated for pas de deux (dance for
two) and are not seen as whole,
distinct pieces in a program.

She also spoke briefly of the

career with Ballanchine because
“he’s at an unusually creative
point." He is currently working on
several ballets, among them “The
Gypsy,” which will feature
Farrell.

In the future, she wants to stay
healthy so she can continue to
dance. ”Dance is an addiction,”
she admitted. But when she does
retireiusually, dancers retire
around age 4Mshe would like to
teach because “i feel I have
something to offer Students since
I've been through it all.”

With such a talent as hers,
Suzanne Farrell will indeed have
an immeasurable storehouse of
experience to share, but for the
time being. ballet lovers all over
will ano-y hcr marvelous onstage
gifts.
