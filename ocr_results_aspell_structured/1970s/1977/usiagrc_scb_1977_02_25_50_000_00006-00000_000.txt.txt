Movies this week
explore Jewish life

by Bill waldner

Despite what your calendar tells
you. both of the films this Week are
part of the Jewish Cultural
Weekend activities. Both films
show. in their own way, the clash
between traditional Jewish culture
and modern culture. and both films
are entertaining and engaging.

The Apprenticeship ole Buddy
Kravitz stars Richard Dreyiuss
(American Graﬂitti; Jaws) as
Duddy, a nineteen year old Jewish
boy who is determined to hustle his
way out oi his middle-class
existence and go all the way to the
top, The Kravitz family lives in
Montreal where Duddy begins
working in the dining room oi a
rather crass resort hotel. On the
advice at his grandfather that
success in life is ensured only if one
owns property, Duddy sets out to
make his fortune and buy his land,
He out-maneuvers his fellow
waiters lmuch to their
displeasure) and attempts to make
some really big money by making
[ilms of Bar Mitzvahs. The way
Duddy sees it, he would much
rather make money pfi of some
other scheme, but Kleenex and the
home permanent have already
been invented. L

Dreyfuss does a ﬁne job of acting
in this very funny movie, which,
though prone to a few excesses, is a
wellrdone and captivating iilm.
Duddy is the kind of non-hero
underdog that you can't help but
identity with.

The film Hester Street is the first

 

etfort of its writer-director Joan
MiCklin Silver. ltis a film about the
American immigrant experience,
and the assimilation of Jews into
American culture, Ms, Silver
captures the texture and quality of
life on the lower east side of New
York. it's almost as iI the
photographs oi Jacob Riis had
been made into a film. Hester
Street is a line example of what a
talented independent filmmaker
can do on a relatively small
budget.

The film takes place in IBQG and
tells the story oi Jake, a Russian -
Jewish immigrant who has been in
the United States for three years,
and his wife Git], who has recently
arrived. To Jake, who has already
become somewhat assimilated into
the American way oi liie, his wiie
represents the past—the Old
Country he has left behind in
Russia. Gitl speaks nothing but
Yiddish and is still faithful to the
Orthodox Jewish ways that Jake
has discarded. To Jake, who has
fallen in love with another. more
“modern” woman, Gitl is no longer
a desirable wile.

Carol Kane, with her neo-
Raphaelite lace and quiet acting
style, gives a stunning per»
lormance as Gitl, while Steven
Keats struggles to maintain an
accent in his role as Jake. Hester
Street might seem a little slow at
iirst, but give it a chance—it's
worth it,—Bi|l Waldner, c-o Jasper
