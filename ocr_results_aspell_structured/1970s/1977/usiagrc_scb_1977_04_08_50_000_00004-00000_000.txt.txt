EPC guidelines
’ required

Suspicions, misunderstandings, and bad feelings
abounded during the recent attempt to hire an East Asian
history professor for next year. Certainly much of the
conﬂict could have been avoided had specific guidelines been
established delineating the rights and powers of the EPC in
such a situation.

We believe that formalized guidelines making more
uniform the rights of all EPCs must be drawn up. And
further, efforts must be made to ensure that both faculty and
students understand and adhere to these guidelines.

Steps toward this end are already underway. Pat Irwin,
chairman of the Curriculum Council, has given Dean Waldo
Walker general guidelines for the standardization of EPCs.
Walker plans to draft a formal document outlining EPC
guidelines for the future.

With regard to the establishment of guidelines governing
EPC rights and powers, we recommend the following: Each
EPC must have a formal advisory role in hiring decisions.
Students on the EPC should work with the department
faculty in defining the position to be filled, aid in preliminary
interviewing, and meet with the candidates when they come
to campus. ,

The EPC should then submit their written recom-
mendations to the faculty for discussion. If the EPC and the
faculty are in disagreement, formal guidelines should be
established whereby the EPC can present their recom-
mendations to both the Executive Council and the
Curriculum Committee .

Unfortunately EPC participation in hiring processes tends
to overshadow other EPC functions. Guidelines for EPCs
should specify bi-monthly meetings between EPC members
and faculty. EPC members must have the responsibility for
reviewing and proposing new courses.

EPCs should also be responsible for conducting interviews
and compiling information in_ an evaluation of a current
faculty member. They should have a formal advisory role in
all tenure and contract renewal considerations.

Other responsibil es should include involvement in long
range planning and initiation of informal discussion sessions,
such as the Wall Street Journal discussions held by
economics majors.

The EPCs are the best group to compile evaluation of
department courses. Instead of piecemeal Grapevine write-
ups. EPC members should be in charge of it review process
for each course.

Presently it seems that.EPCs meet to try and have their
opinions heard in hiring processes. to do evaluations, and to
plan parties. They should be more than pinch hit
organizatons with different roles in different departments,
They must be standardized: their powers must be defined:
and they must operate as an integral part of' each depart-
ment.

Graduation
conﬂict

To the editor: ThiS week a fellow
senior pointed out that graduation
(May uthi fell on the Jewish Holy
day shavuos. which com-
memorates the day the Laws were
handed down at Mt. Sinai. It is not
my intention to force the ad
ministration to incorporate the
Jewish holidays into the college
calendar. It is my intention to
declare my indignation and
amazement, because this is not the
first time this kind of thing has
occurred in {our years here. Three
years ago. Parens and Alumni
Weekend was scheduled on Yom
Kippur, the holiest day of the year
for Jews. Another weekend had to
be scheduled to accomodale
Jewish ParenB and Alumni. Large
parties with big cash expenditures
on alcohol and munchies have
been scheduled on Passover.

All I ask is that the rights of
Jewish students, parents, and
alumni be respected by a simple
consultation of a calendar or ap
propriate sources that live in the
campus community, As Social
Coordinator, I am aware of the
scheduling difficulties that can
arise, but the academic calendar is
laid out months or even years in
advance, and some allowance
could be made. if graduation was
May 25th, instead of May 24th,
there would be no problem 1 hope
these considerations are made in
the future. Robert Render

Norris needs water —"
proof windows rather

than new curtains

To the editor: Spring, I gather, is
dorm improvement time and
Norris Hall has been deemed the
proud recipient of a new crop of
curtains. Nice of them

The monsoon before break,
however. hinted rather obtrusively
that curtains may perhaps not be
enough. Norris Hall, being a
product oi recent capitalist con»
Struction, Seems to have been
somehow patterned alter the m.
famous Chevrolet Corvair: have it
rain, and one is confronted with
what is commonly referred to as
extensive leaking; have a good
healthy wind and one begins to fear
structural collapse; but have it
monsoon (as was the case a few
weeks ago) and one diagnoses such
previously unforeseen phenomena
as internal puddlirlg. warping of

the record collection, and elec-
trocution by Stereo. 1 exhausted
my entire week's allotment of
bathtowels in a valiant but often
unsuccessful attempt to keep my
valuables out of the range of
penetration, Regardless at even
my more successful efforts
however, most of the materi
occupants of my room will never
be the same.

The point I am ever so intently
trying to make is that there are
few considerations in the way
“dorm improvements" in this
place which could conceivably take
precedence over “new curtains."

You're giving a dying man a new
wardrobe when what he needs is

Competition is
purpose of .
collegiate athletics

To the editor: It is well that the
editors of this paper have taken the
time to look at the state ofathletics
at Grinnell It is important to
examine all aspects or the
“Grinnell Experience," The
editorial tssa, 34777) concerned
itselfwith the prevailing attitude of
some teams here at Grinnell. It
seems that winning is no longer
important to many of the athletes
here at Grinnell, This is a sad state
of affairs.

Intercollegiate athletics do not
exist tor the purpose at pure

recreation or, as the editorial put,

it, “participation." Intercollegiate
athletics exist on the principles oi
competition and excellence or
performance, not solely tor
recreation and participation. For
those who wish to participate only
Grinnell College has a fullprogram
of physical,educauon'classes, and

an excellent intramural program.

The true purpose of in
tercollegiate athletics is to find out
how we as athletes will handle the
challenges of competition, will we
as athletes rise to the challenge of
thls pressure or succumb to it? It is
not necessary to win all of the time
to beasuccess but to lose all of th
time does not say very much of our
ability to overcome the pressures
of competition.

No school the size of Grinnell
College can support the iinanci i
drain on equipment, facilities, and
iaculty time to support “par-
ticipation” programs on the in-
tercollegiate level I believe that
the desire exists in enough athletes
at Grinnell to i'ustily a truly in-
tercollegiate athletic program.
They have the spirit of com-
petition, all they need is. the pride

-in their program: Toni noun
