Save the Equal Rights Amendment

by Ellyn Toscano

The Equal Rights Amendment:

Section 1. Equality of rights
under the law shall not be denied or
abridged by the United States or by
any State on account of sex.

Section 2. The Congress shall
have the power to enforce by ap
propriate legislation the provisions
of this article.

Section 3. This amendment shall
take effect two years after the date
of ratification.

On March 2, State Senator
Eugene I'lill from Newton in
troduced a resolution calling for

(the nullification of Iowa's passage
of the ERA. 0n the same day an
estimated 200 to 300 antirEM
women dressed in pink and

arrying loaves of homemade

bread marched into me Senate
gallery in support of the
resolution. The resolution now goes
to the Senate Judiciary Committee
and although at this time it ap
pears the committee is favorably
inclined toward the ERA, a switch
of two votes would be fatal. If
approved and reported out of
committee, it would then go to the
Senate floor for a vote. Then, if
passed, it would be referred to the
House of Representatives.

As of this time, 34 of the

9 Local lunatic laments lack

by Tom Paltzer
Before this academic yar runs
ibrough its usual mundane course,
Grinnell should have its first an-
nual Lunacy Week. During this
very special period the humdrum
activities of the college should'be
totally disrupted by acLs of lunacy
and-or degeneracy, The Grinnell
Relays may be a first tentative
step in the right direction, but the
Relays last for only a couple of
days, and will be incorporated into
Lunacy Week.
To start one general rule for the
'iveek should be stated. in order to
drive the campus truly crazy, all
drugs and sexual activity of any
type will be banned until the
climactic event of the week, All
those who are caught submitting to
temptation will be sent to live for a
month in Burling Library, where
they will spend all their time
rivriting original graffiti on every
inch of wall space in the structure.
Degeneracy squads should be
formed to oversee the smooth
operation of the week’s festivities.
These squads must be handpicked
from among the most degenerate
and vulgar individuals on campus.

33 states necessary have ratified
the ERA. It will become effective
in two years following passage by
four more states.

Opponents of the ERA have
imagined many negative results of
ratification of the amendment, The
Senate Judiciary Committee, the
courts and experience with equal
rights amendments in state con-
stitutions have proved these fears
groundless. Fighting sex
discrimination in individual court
cases and through passage of his
cremental legislation through the
Congress has been slow and
ineffective in dealing with the
problem, The change can only
come through the passage of a
Constitutional Amendment with its
massive legal, moral and symbolic
impact.

Here are some facts about the
potential impact of the ERA,
borrowed from a pamphlet
published by Common Cause:

AGE OF MAJORITY: State laws
which set different ages of
majority for men and women will
have to be amended, Whatever age
is chosen will apply to both sexes

BUSINESS: Laws which require
women to meet special
qualifications to engage in
business. such as requiring a

These people will be the shock
troops that catalyze events. They
will supervise the daily activities
enumerated below, and also create
any spontaneous events that might
become apparent as possibilities
during the course of the week.

Now for the activity central to
each day of the week.

Monday: All persons who have
not Visited the PEC in the last two
weeks tprobably half the campus
or more) will undertake a forced
march to this facility, and be
commanded to run a mile. Those
who have a time higher than six
minutes for this distance will be
incarcerated in the PEG until
they can break this barrier. The
load service will have to make
special arrangements for the
shipment of food into the Complex
since a few unfortunate souls may
spend the remainder of the school
year vainly striving for this goal,

Conversely, all people who
frequent the PEC will be tied to
their beds for a long enough period
of time so that all their muscles
turn to mounds ofjelly, Also. while
they lie In bed, a teleVIsion with all-
sports programming will be kept

EDUCATION: The impact of the
ERA on education will be eXr
tensivc. For example, women and
men will have to be considered on
an equal basis for admission to
state-run schools, Allstemale and
all-male public schools will have to
be sex-integrated. Discriminatory
“tracking" of girls and boys leg.
mechanics for boys and home
economics for girls) will be
prohibited, Such courses will have
to be available to both sexes.
JURY DUTY: States which
excuse women as a class from jury
duty on the assumption that
women have family responr
sibilities not shared by men must
amend their laws. If an automatic
exemption is granted for family
responsibilities, it must be
available to men as well as women.
LICENSES: States will not be
able to exclude women from obs
taining any type of state license.
Nor will states be able to place
more stringent requirements on
women than on men for qualifying
for such licenses. Examples are
liquor, sports or business licenses.
SEXUAL ASSAULT: Children
and adults of both sexes are sub
ject to many of the same kinds of

on twenty-four hours a day, with
Howard Cosell as the only an-
nouncer.

Tuesday: All chemistry majors
will be locked up in a laboratory
until they discover a chemical that
can be sprinkled on institutional
food to magically make it taste like
mom’s home cooking. These
people will be in a great deal of
trouble, because this task will be
roughly equivalent to the search
for the philosophers stone, If the
stone happens to appear in the
midst of their researches, the
entire Science 'building can be
transformed into gold, and then
slowly dismantled to solve the
college's financial problems.

Wednesday: The S848 staff will
have all copy in on time, and all of
it will be concise and well-Written.

lunacy. indeed.) The issue,
however. will be a pornographic

THE DRAFT: Congress has
always had the power to draft
women, At present, there is no
draft but if there were, under

‘ERA. both men and women would

be required to register. Congress,
however,
exemptions and defermenm from
military service. According to the
Senate Report on the ERA
amendment, “Those women who
are physically and mentally
unqualified or who are con
scientious objectors, or who are
exempted because of their
responsibilities (eg, certain public
officials or those with dependents)
will not have to serve. just as men
who are unqualified or exempt."

There is a great deal of question
as to whether it is constitutional to
reselnd an amendment once it has
been passed by a state. According
to the U S Constitution Article V,
Congress proposes amendments
and state legislatures may ratify.
In 1973 the Senate Judiciary
Committee stated that once a state
legislature has exercised in power
to ratify, it has exhausted its

has the power to set,

 

power,This has been supported by
past actions of Congress when it
declared the 14th Amendment
ratiﬁed in the states of Ohio and
New Jersey which had originally
ratified and later voted to rescind.

NOW has organized a campaign
to prevent the move to rescind
Iowa ratification. Grinnell's state
legislator, Joan Orr, is a strong
supporter of the ERA and thus,‘
need not be contacted. Other
means suggested byesNOW to
lobby against this move are to
Write letters to the editor of the Des
Moines Register and lo call radio
talk shows.

The ERA is both a symbolic
recognition of the need for real
equal rights [or all citizens and a
mandate for change. It will have
both a psychological and legal .
effect. It is up to supporters of the
ERA to lobby for its ratification.
The struggle for its passage will be
played out in sixteen states and
changing just a few legislators‘
votes could make the ERA the 27th
Amendment to the Constitution.
Although it may not even be con
stitutional to rescind ratification,
lowa must continue support and
State Senator Hill’s’ resolution
must be challenged.

slingshots and eggs will be used as,
weapons to pelt anyone venturing

rotten eggs anyway.

The fight will be to the death with

one campus for all their Grinnell
years will be considered
unquestionably loyal. Those who
have lived on both campuses will
be regarded with distrust by both
sides. Those who show the slightest
sign ofdisloyalty will be sent to live
in the animal room of the science
building. Eventually they will
escape to live in the tunnel system
beneath the college, making life
hazardous for the B&G workers
who must go down there. The
losing campus in the Relays will be
sentenced to a lifetime at Gl'innelli
and all made lifetime members of
the SGA. The winning campus will
