Trustees to consider capital Campaign

Grinnell’s Board of Trustees will arrive
on campus this weekend for its
November 5 meeting, the most important
of the three regular annual sessions. The
day is tightly scheduled for the Trustees,
who plan to discuss numerous topics.

According to Grinnell president A.
Richard Turner, major discussion will
center on the proposed capital campaign, a
concentrated effort to raise approximately
18 million dollars for the college. The
campaign, tentatively scheduled to begin

this Decmeber, will be under the direction ,

of the Office of Development.

Turner predicts that “the great bulk of
the money will come from private sour-
095" while government aid, grants from
private foundations and gifts from

businesses will contribute a smaller
proportion.

Concerning use of the funds gathered by
the campaign. the Trustees will discuss
items listed on a so-called “need table."
These include operating funds of about
four million dollars for the next five years;
money for renovation of dormitories,
Burling Library, Goodnow Hall, and
Gl-innell House; addition of an art gallery
to the Fine Arts Building; construction of a
building with minimal facilities on Conard
Biology Preserve; and expansion of the
science library. In addition, Turner noted
that the campaign will tentatively attempt
to raise considerable endowmenm for the
arts, contemporary affairs, teaching
profusorships, research, financial aid,

library acquisition, and modest expansion
of teaching of Asian subjects.

Turner believes that the Trustees will
approve most of these items with little
discussion, with talk centering instead on
specific dollar amounts for each item,
“The dollar figures have changed and may
still change,” Turner noted, not wishing to
release the proposed dollar amounts
at this time.

Affirmative Action Will also be discussed
this weekend. A 'h-ustee subcommittee has
been considering the issue, in
addition to the subcomittee‘s input,
Student Body President Jon Neiderbach
and several SGA cabinet members will
address the entire Board on this topic at
9:30 am. Saturday in the Burling Viewing

Room.

Nciderbaeh and the other cabinet
members also plan to present' the SGA
South Africa resolution, which calls for the
voting of a proxy by the Trustees, at the
9:30 meeting. in addition, they plan to
propose a student activity lee increase of
$10 to help finance the expanding SGA
involvement in bringing speakers to
campus as well as simply keep pace with
inﬂation.

Ina 11:10 a.m. session with the Trustees
Committee on Community Life, students
representing the Committee on Student
Life, newly formed this year, will tene
tatively discuss an alcohol policy calling
for limitation of alcoholic consumption.

Fairbank views U.S., China

By Dan Blum
John K. Fairbank, as one of America's leading
China‘ specialists, has consistently been a voice
crying out in the wilderness for America to learn
about China and base its consideration of China
policy on a rational understanding of the differences
in culture and priorities between the two coun-
tris rather than on hysteria. It was Fairbank who
coined the phrase: “The century where China had
to learn to live in the Western world is past, now we
must both learn to live on the same planet.“

Born in South Dakota in 1907, Fairbank was
educated at Harvard and made his first of many
visits to China in 1932. His understanding of the
.facts in China must have often been a source of
considerable frustration to him as he watched
America, laboring under misconceptions about
China and its relationship to the Communist world,
become involved in two costly and tragic East Asian
wars.

‘DURING the McCarthy period, Fairbank was
accused of being a Communist for publicly asser—
ting the necessity of China’s representation both at
the UN and at any disarmament talks. Today,
however, containment is a relic of the past, and the
new policy is “normalization,” Fairbank now en-
joys the prestigious academic position of Chairman
of the Council of East Asian Studies at Harvard
and is frequently consulted by governmental bodies
concerned with US-China relations.

THE school of China specialists tends to divide
along two lines on the question of the origin of
Chinese Communism, One side sees the revolution
as an inevitable response to imperialism, While the
other considers it to have been brought about by the
Japanese invasion and the Communists successful
exploitation of peasant nationalism during me
period. Fair-bank stands somewhere in the middle of

 

the spectrum. He feels some kind of social
revolution was inevitable.

“IF the revolution had not had Communist aims,
it would have had something very like them,
mobilization of the people and getting rid of foreign
influence.” However, he acknowledges that “the old
way of life was a stable way, it had its beauties. It is
difficult to tell if life was unsupportable before the
revolution. 1 think it became unsupportable after
the Japanese invasion. That was a letdown for an
entire modernizing generation. The Chinese
Communists came in as Saviors at first."

Whatever the origins of Communism in China, it

7 is now an established fact, and Sinologists differ in

their appraisal of the Revolution. Certainly, it has
had its oscillations. it has seen sharp swings bet
ween the two often contradictory policies of
promoting social change and answering the
pressing need for economic development.

FAIRBANK suggested the following framework
for evaluating the revolution‘s conﬂicting goals.
“Mao stood for bringing the peasants to modern
life. which probably represents the people as well as
anything. That this is' a different objective from
simple economic production is seen in the effort to
get Chinese citizens to work without hope for profit,
Obviously, this is a very utopian kind of ideal. The
people in power now have instituted wage in.
centives and private plots in the hope of increasing
production. After all, the country faces an enor-
mous food supply problem because of its population
problem ”

FAIRBANK describes the new regime as
revisionist in the sense that it has “given up social
revolution because other things are overriding.
You've got to get production to feed people, you
have to organize the state, build up defense.

, ‘Gang bang’ provides
alcoholpolicy test‘ ‘

ByJohlISllunmay
The James Hall Gang Bang,
being held tomorrow night,
Saturday November 5, is an im.
portant part ot the issue con.
cerning alcohol use and abuse on

Grinnell campus, .
According to both Dean of
Student Affairs Jim Tederman and

‘ President of the Student Govern»

nlcnt Ass [landed Neidel‘bacll,
the major problem is the
possibility that Grinnell College is
encouraging alcohol abuse.
Although Grinnell does not wish to
promote a total ban on hard alcohol
at campus parties, it also Wishes
to avoid a system whereby
students drink too much. In the
words of Neiderbach, “a System is
needed to promote rational, sen-
sible and moderate drinking."
FURTHER. it is the opinion of
some Grinnell students and faculty
that students should not have to
paya fee which is used to purchase
hard alcohol if they do not wish to
drink it. Similarly, many feel that
money normally spent on hard
alcohol could be better spent in
other areas. Other, more minor
issues include the lessening of
liability problems for the college.
In open, all-campus parties there is
a Chance that Grinnell could be
held responsible for any injury

 

money‘s worth by drinking a lot in
a short time, Equally important.
however, is the hope that more‘
people will be served to their
Satisfaction, Also, only those
drinking the alcohol will be forced
to pay for the alcohol

THERE HAVE heen numerous
arguments against the James
method for serving hard liquor.
Some feel that Grinneil has been
fortunate enough to have a
tradition of free parties. ln the
minds of these students and faculty
members, James would be
breaking this tradition. According
to Tedcrman, however. open bar
parties have only been in existence
for a few years, thus refuting the
argument of a long free bar
tradition, Some feel that paying for
mixed drinks could lead to a trend
of paying additional fees for all
entertainment. Tederman spoke
out against this argument as well,
stating that such a trend would be
unlikely due to the morality in;
volved in the ‘liquor issue in con»
trast to the amoral character of
most other entertainment, Finally,
there are some who argue the
James method discriminates
against the hard alcohol drinkers.
According to Tederman,
discrimination in this context is
unavoidable, so keeping

proven to be a direct cause of too
much alcohol consumption.
Although the chances of this are
slim. the possibility exists,

The James Hall method involves
the sale of tickets in advance,
Students buy a 25 cent ticket for
each mixed drink they wish to
consume at-the party. The money
collected is in turn used to pur.
chase the alcohol, Student
government funds are used to
purchase only beer and soda. It is
hoped that this method will err
courage greater control of
drinking, more emphasis on
gradual alcohol consumption and
less emphasis on quick drinking, It
is also hoped that the tickets will
erase the feeling of getting one’s

only alternative.

Other proposals and alternative
methods of change include
bringing one’s own alcohol to
parties or banning hard liquor
itotally. However. both of these
ideas have met with opposition.
Banning hard alcohol completely
has met Strong negative reactions
and bringing alcohol to parties
could lead to greater abuse and
possible injury due to broken liquor

began the examination of the
alcohol policy. The committee was
