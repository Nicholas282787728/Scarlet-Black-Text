Film features desolation in the Big Apple

By Michael Greenﬁeld
it may not be overly presump
tuous of me to say that many of you
have heard Something about the
film Taxi Driver. So belore any
sort of formal review of the movie,
it would be fair to say that
whatever you might have heard
about the film is probably true.
Yes, the ending of the film
somewhat resembles a battlefield .
. . it is extremely bloody, So if you
are repulsed by the sight of blood,
maybe you should leave about ten
minutes from the end. However,
the film as a whole shines. in many
respects it is one of the finest films
ever made. Taxi Driver is a
disturbing, frightening film, but it
also has the excitement that goes

with its vision of the big city.

THE CITY is New York. From
the opening shotithe gushing and
hissing of steam emerging from a
manhole~you know exactly where
you are. In essence, the director,
Martin Scorsese. tells us that the
film is about thepressures that boil
up in the streets of cities. Through
these streets drives 'lravis Bickle

he’s interested in the blacks of
South Africa and the gymnasium
at Kent State. Now don't go grab a

that. I'm not debating the rights or
wrongs oi either issue. l just
question their importance to the
majority of Grinnell students.

AS OF THIS writing. the Joint
Boards have spent the majority oi
their time discussing South Africa
and Kent State. The only products
to come from all this discussion
have been a vague resolution about
writing a letter condemning the
building of a gymnasium on
Blanket Hill at Kent State, and a
policy statement on South Africa.
As far as the resolution for the
diverstiture of stocks in companies
involved in South Africa, the Joint
Boards have tabled it twice.
While many board members
are indecisive about the divestiture
issues, a small group of students,
unhappy with the job the SGA has
been doing, are trying to make
themselves heard. Mark
Sherinian, assistant Student
coordinator told me, “Maybe there
is some concern for moral issues
like South Africa and Kent State,
but I'm sure there’s a group of
people on campus who consider the
Joint Boards on Cloud Nine in the
first place. Now. with issues like
the ones we've dealt With so iar,
they see us going into outer-space.
Credibility will, in the end, be
based on what it (SGA) does to
enhance the environment of
Grinnell College and to better the
lives of the student body."

GREGG Edwards, hall rep from
Mears, put it this way: “Every
week we have a new moral issue to
discuss. We’ll (SGA) be the great

Edwards added, “The SGA has
really misperceived the Kent State
issue. Many people have come up
to me and asked, “Doesn‘t the SGA
have anything else to talk about?
isn’t there anything at Grinnell to
talk about?’ "

ONE OF the most vocal critics of
this years SGA is Bob Greenberg,
who said, “We're not representing
the students, We’re not doing what
we’re supposed to do. We’ve
wasted a month now, that‘s four
meetings, discussing South Africa.
The SGA is turning into the folly
that the students think we are i
feel like i'm butting my head
against a Stone wall. People don’t
listen and I get frustrated,"

Sherinian most appropriately
sums up the feelings of those who
criticize this year's SGA: “The
Joint Board members must come
to the meetings with concrete ideas
instead of opinions, What happens
now is they voice their opinions, a
statement is drafted, and that’s as

 

night,” he confida to the diary
that initially offers some outlet.
The streets are a neon-ﬂickered
nightmare of prostitutes, pimps
and criminals, all 01 whom leave
their disease for him to wipe off the
seat of his cab.

HE DEVELOPS a crush on a
beauty in the distance, ultimately
alienating her by taking her to a
porno movie. Then he tria to
rescue a young prostitute from her
pimp. Eventually, he turns himself
into a walking arsenal. determined
to stand up and make his
declaration: “Here’s a man who
would not take it any more. who
stood up against the scum and
filth." After he is foiled in an
assassination attempt, we are

far as it goes. Traditionally, this
has always been the problem with
the Joint Boards, Maybe it's about
time that people took an interest in
trying to bring relevant issues to
the SGA and personally take part
of the burden oi solving those
problems.”

50 HERE we stand, a student
body with a president Who suggests
irrelevant issues and student
representatives who spend most or
their time attempting to deal with
them. Please, don't misunderstand
me, this is not meant as a personal
attack on Jon Nelderbach In fact.
Idon’t blame him for pursuing the
issues he does because the way
student elections work at Grinnell,
he’s been led to believe that we
want him to act that way. But, if in
fact, i’m to understand the
criticisms of some members of the
SGA, and if i'm judging the
feedback from many students I
talk to on campus' correctly,
then there‘s serious doubt in my
mind that our SGA president is
acting in our best interest.

”National Armband Day" ac-
ti ties here on campus. These
activities included the distribution
of red armbands to commemorate

the slayings at Kent and Jackson
State. a rally on central campus in
the evening, and and the placing of
crosses on central campus. The
rally attracted just under 25
people, falling somewhat short of
what committee organizers had
hoped for. The placing of crosses
was also timed to coincide with the
visit to campus oi Marine
recruiters.
