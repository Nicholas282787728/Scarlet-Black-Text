Trains nearly gone, inﬂuence lingers on

By Elaine Ashbaugtl

A town initiated by a hoarse
voice and a pistol fight, planned
around a single red railroad sure
veyor’s flag, and purchased for a
minimal sum oi $2 per acre (rather
than an expected $30) through the
fortuitous discovery of an old prey
emption lawito what sort of
thoroughly uncivilized area could
such a history possibility pertain?
Why, to Grinnell, of course.
founded on the dream of western
railroad expansion in 1354.

Josiah Bushnell Grinnell of New
York City had lost his Vuicekno
small problem tor a preacher
However, taking the advice oi
Horace Greeley to “Go West,
young man, go West," J.B. adr
\ rtised for fellow colonists
"desirous of educational facilities,
and oi temperance and oi
Congregational ailinity, who wish
to settle on some new western
railroad or one projected,” (Philip
Bridgham, History oi the First
Three Years oi the Village of
Grinnell.)

Initially, J B, looked over some
land of his wife's near a railroad in
Missouri. However, Missouri‘s
slavery rendered such a site un-
satisfactory to such an ardent
abolitionist as J.B, Grinnell. 0n

Grinnell‘s return trip through
Illinois. an argument over slavery
ended in the drawing of pistols.
Undoubtedly, bloodshed would
have ensued had not a Mr. Henry
Farman intervened to save dB.

This chance meeting and ensuing
iriendship ultimately determined
the character and placement of
J.B.’s proposed settlement—
Famam just happened to be the
director of the Chicago-Rock
Island Railroad,

Farnam's engineer, Mr.
Theodore Bacon, kept J.B. in-
formed about railroad develop-
ments. “I am convinced in my first
impression that you choose a
location at once on township EA),
range 16 west, near what is known
as Lattimer’s Grove. It is the best
prairie I have seen, well watered,
400 feet above the Mississippi river

' on the summit and on the natural
line of a North and South railroad.
should one be built." Furthermore,
Bacon assured J.B. of a stopping
place on the ChicagoRock Island
line.

B. became convinced that on
this probable railroad junction his
settlement should be located.
Despite the differing opinions of his
fellow colonizers, IE. and com-
pany arrived at the present site of
the Grinnell Rock Island depot in
the spring of 1854. Gathered around
the single red surveyer’s flag,
another "council" was held. J.B.
predominated and Within hours
purchased 5000 acres at the Iow
City land oflice. ' ' - ' '

 

 

With a $50,000 incentive posted
by the people of Iowa City to the
railroad builders if a locomotive
reached their town by midnight of
December 3), 1855, the eastern
Iowa section of the ChicagoRock
Island track was completed within
seconds of the deadline. The stalled
locomotive was actually pushed
into the Iowa City station by the
willing hands of workmen and
townspeople alike.

Although the town of Grinnell
sprang up around the proposed
railroadjunction in 1854, the actual
tracks of the Chicagoﬂock Island
line were not completed until 1863.
The passenger and ireight tran-
sport provided by this line became
instrumental in Grinnell’s
economic and demographic
growth.

In 1871 Grinnell iinally became a
railroad junction with the com-
pletion oi the north-south Mina
neapolis-St.Louis line. According
to the Grinnell Herald Register oi
May 22, 1958, “the spacious plat-
forms of the Union Depot were
covered with Citizens who had
come to show their interest and
secure a ride If accommodations
would allow."

Ultimately, the already over-
crowded train pulled outito the-

firing of cannon and waving of

flags, with only about 75 Grin-v

nellians aboard. Searsboro (of
Little Bear Inn fame) was reached
in hall an hour.

The train stopped a few miles
further on tor the driving oi the
iinal spike. with a telegraph wire
“attached to the polished spike and
another wrapped around the
hammer which was to send it
home...the electric circle was
made complete when the hammer
rested on the spike. Each tap was
heard by friends in New York.”

Grinnell‘s two lines provided
both passenger and freight service.
Passenger service on the north
south line was daily.

Grinnell College, as well as the
town, has long been closely con
nected with the trains. Not only do
the Minneapoliert. Louis tracks
run right through campus carrying
daily trains, but many Grinnell
students at one time travelled over
these and the Rock Island tracks.
Trains provided the major form of
transportation for Grinnell
students for many decades.

In his memoirs, 19044919, Louis
D. Hartson, later Professor
Emeritus of Psychology at Oberlin
College. remembers that “seventy
yars ago it was the practice for
older students to meet freshmen as
they arrived by train." Up-
perclassmen often recommended
housing for incoming freshmen
since Mears Cotmge, the only

wesl route since 1863.

dorm on campus provided housing
ior only a small percentage oi
women.

The day alter his arrival, Harte
son hired himself out to haul trunks
from the depot to the students'
lodgings. His day's earnings of
$5.25 “was more than I was to earn
in a day for many years to come.”

On a September day in 1906. two
young men eyed each other across
the aisle of a passenger car
crowded with students bound for
Grinnell and Iowa City. Both were
freshmen on their way to Grinnell,
Both were nearly penniless, a fact
which changed their chance
meeting on the train into a bond or
friendship, One was James Nora
man Hall (of Mutiny on the Bounty,
Men Against the Sea. The
llurricane reknownl: the other,
Chester C. Davis. who became
head of the AAA (Agricultural
Adjustment Administration) in
President Franklin D, Roosevelt's
administration and later president
of the federal reserve bank in St.
Louis

Grinnell College, as well as its
individual students, used the
railroad [or transportation. In
October 1541 some 250 students
took a five coach special train to
the Grinnell-Drake classic in Des
Moines. The $235 tickets covered
both admission to the sports event
and the round-trip train fare. The
11:45 pm. return train from Des
Moines was to arrive in Grinnell at
l a.m. “Women on the trip will be

 

expected to be in Within fifteen
minutes after the train gets in,"
the October 3 Scarlet and Black
reported,

According to a Grinnell student
of the early 1950‘s, last minute ,
rushes to 8 a.m. classes wer«_
impossible—long trains regularly
crossed campus at 7:55, just in
time to detain last minute class
dashers.

The ‘50'5 also saw the frequent
use of trains as a back-drop for
yearbook pictures. Waving
students hanging irom coach
windows and groups oi students
arriving at the depot showed up
irequently.

Passenger service to Grinnell
died in 1970. Although Several bills
were proposed in the Iowa
Legislature as late as 1974 which
included revival of passenge
service to Grinnell, no such acti
has taken place. Amtrak, running'
across southern and eastern iowa,
provides the nearest passenger
service. Even ireight service to .

standstill.

Although the railroad no longer
ofiers practical service to Grinnell
students, it does provide the back-
drop for a few ireshman romances
and good practice in walking a
straight line. And the occasional
rumble of a train or an infrequent
sighting while on an excursion to
the library reminds Grinnellians
that the trains are not totally exVA
tinct.
