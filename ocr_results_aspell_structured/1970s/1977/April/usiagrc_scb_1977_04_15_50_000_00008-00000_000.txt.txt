The curator wears tennis shoes

by Thomas Michael Paltzer

Richard Cervene is one of those
people who tackle life with a great
amount of exuberance. He needs
this quality, along with vast
quantities of energy, because he is
kept very busy in his dual role as
professor of art and curator of the
college’s Permanent Art Collec-
tion.

Not many students know of
Cervene's role with the permanent
collection. In fact, many students
are probably ignorant of the
existence of the permanent art
collection owned by the college,
The collection was initiated in 1961
with three paintings. Before this
beginning step the college had only
the rental collection, which con
sisted of good reproductions along
With a few original works. This
Collection has also been continued
down to the present.

“As a Valentine’s gift, I am sure,
I had a note on February 14, 1972
from the dean‘s office asking me to
be curator.” Prior to this time, the
chairman of the art department
was given the additional duty of
overseeing the collection. Cervene
felt it was an honor to be selected
for such a post, and readily ac»
cepted. He says the collection is
“absolutely stunning for a college
of this size.” In the past sixteen
years the college has accumulated
6B1 works, some through gifts. and
others have been purchased. In»
eluded are Works by Rembrandt,
Picasso, and Calder,

One major source for the per.
manent collection is the Marie
Louise and Samuel B. Rosenthal
Fund that was started in 1966 for
the purchase of original works.
Recent acquisitions have included
the Rehling collection. and a
collection of African art from Zaire
donated by Kenneth Adelman, ’67.
Both of these gifts are being
received by the college in
segments. A show of some Zairian
works will begin on the 20th of this
month in the Forum, Some of the
wooden African works have begun
tosplit in storage, and Cervene has
applied wet towels to them in an
effort to seal the cracks. This
emergency procedure has been
successful thus far, but he does not
yet know how to permanently

, repair the damage,

One of the major problems with
the collection is the lack of
adequate storage space on cam»
pus, The part of the collection not
on display around me campus,
roughly half, is stored in a
basement room of the Fine Arts
Building. This storage area has no
air conditioning, and the cooling
system is turned off throughout the
rest of the building during the
summer brea ’This is a less than

i I . I . I I ideal condition-for'the‘storage of '

 

 

valuable pieces of art.

Access to the works in storage is
also limited because of security
considerations. Since they are
stored in protective Wrappers,
viewing these works is further
complicated. Students can,
however. see the stored collection
any weekday morning when an
employee is working in the storage
room.

Cervene ultimately envisions a
study-research center someplace
on campus where the collection
canoe stored, and where students
and faculty can do extensive
research on the Works in the
collection. Cervene says the
collection is a “very important
teaching tool and good public
relations, frankly."

In some respects Cervene feels
the investment by the college In
works of art is better than stocks
and bonds, “The real value of the
collection, however. is being able
tolook at the original." In his View,
no reproduction can do justice to
a fine piece of artwork.

Fort Dodge, lowa is Cervene’s
hometown, where he grew up in a
house only two blocks from the
home of the parents of Joseph
Wall, another Grinnell professor,
After attending high school in Fort
Dodge he came to Grinnell in the
late ’50'5, and graduated with a BA
in art. Cervene was a typical
Grinnell student in that It took him
until his junior year to decide upon

at Grinnell he had intended to be an
American Studies major. After
Grinnell he attended both the
University of Iowa and Yale
University on fellowships.

At that point in his life, he says.
“the lastthing inmy mind was that
i would ever come back to Grin-
nell,“ A one-year contract was
open, however, and Cervene has
been teaching Grinnell students in
his unique style since that time,

He is one of the few members of
the campus community who can
act excited about being in class at
eight in the morning. Cervene’s
lecture style is interesting because
he tends to yell certain words and
phrases at his audience, which
does keep students awake early in
the morning. His lecture on kchh
in Intro to Art is worth an entire
semester’s attendance, He is also
among the select group of faculty
members who include Jack Purcell
tennis shoes as an integral part of
their wardrobe.

Cervene was a student when the
North Campus dorms _were all
male. He lived in Smith during all
four of his years at Grinnell. Each
dorm, or “house," as they were
called then, had a housemother.
The freshman students went
'through an extensive period of

 

prepping." They had to wear a
beanie with their class year em-
blazoned across it, and had to do
various menial chores for up-
perclassmen. .

On “Hell Night,” when all the
freshmen were formally initiated
into the house, Cervene was
assigned the task “to get a big
ladder, and put names on all the
lampposts downtown." The police
were alerted by his housemates
and he spent a couple of hours in
the town jail before they liberated
him Cervene feels there was a
“particular kind of hall feeling”
that does not exist on campus
today.

either a great success or it fails
miserably. He has looked at some
completed works and said,
”The damn thing, I did it. and I
did it wrong.”

Despite his loyalty to the
college, Cervene says he needs the
summer vacations to get back into
a frame of mind where he is
“anxious to holler in classes,” He
retreats to an area with a tropical
Climate for his summer breaks, He
does most of his painting during
these periods, In the sixties he
spent eight summers and a six
month period in Acapulco. On his
first trip down to the resort, Cer-

Even with these misadventures
at Grinnell, Cervene still thinks it
is a good place to be. For an in»
dividual interested in art, he feels a
liberal arts education is par-
ticularly important. Those who go
to art schools or conservatories
“get to be a mechanic of the arts;
they need ideas." He thinks all
courses, even such as science and
literature, can be important in the

»later career of an artist, even

though he admits “nobody Could
have told me that while I was a
student here,”

Cervene would be an excellent
recruiter for the college. He says it
is “nice to be proud ofa place even
with its ups and downs.” He thinks
Grinnell is a friendly place, and
that the school’s “track recordl
isn’t very bad for cultural events."
In the race lor new students
Cervene thinks these aspects of the
school are important. “A sunny

vene knew very little Spanish, but
he had decided to think of Mexico
as “an extension of Texas.” He
found it nearly impossible to
complete such necessary tasks as
the purchase at fuel for his car.

prospective comes to campus for a
visit

Besides teaching. Cervene is an
artist in his own right. He has sold
many works, and has had shows at
the Des Moines Art Center and the
Forum, among other places. His
early work was “very ex-
pressionistic and romantic.”
Recently, he has been making
color field paintings in which he
tries to reduce his favorite subject,

the Caribbean, to an abstraction.

Cervene says he uses “color

qualities that are, for me,
emotional." He is not interested in
the ”photo realism style that is
mechanical. Imake a decision, and
I want that to show." The major
problem with this type of work,
according to Cervene, is that it is.

the two elements he considers
crucial for complete enjoyment of
the summer months, “I like the
water and the sun. I get all my
energy from the sun."

A few yars ago, during the
summer of 1971, Cervene took a
vacation which included an eXs
tensive tour in Africa. He was in
Uganda when ldi Amin took over
political control at the country in a
military coup. He and some
companions were returning from a
safari to a national park when 9:

to travel only during daylight
hours on the long trip back to the
capital. Kampala. Once the
Cervene spent most of the time
his hotel room, and says that t e
drums that he and other aliens in
the hotel heard at night “sounded
straightdut ofa B western movie."

Before the coup in Uganda,
Cervene had obtained a letter of
introduction from a travel agent to
one of his colleagues in Nairobi,
Kenya. Upon his arrival there
Cervene Went to see this woman,
and was immediately invited to a
cocktail party at her uncle's home
that afternoon. After some gentle
persuasion he decided to accept
The woman picked him up at
hotel and drove him quite a
distance out of the city. At that
point Cervene says he was
beginning to think “What cocktai
party?”

He and his escort eventually
entered a hmvily guarded estate,
and approached a palatial home.
Before entering, he asked his
companion where they were, and
she replied that her unsle was

and said to himself, ”I think I have
to have several of these." He fl.‘
eventually speak to Kenyatta for a
few moments, and found him to be
a charming man.

Although Cervene has no definite
plans to leave Grinnell in the
future, he likes to keep his opt
open. Next year he will be on a
leave second semester, and is
thinking about a trip to Japan, a
part of the world he has never seen
before. That means next year
students will be able to listen to
him “holler in classes" for only one
semester,
