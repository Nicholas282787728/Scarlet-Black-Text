SGA should
not subsidize
booze

Can SGA afford to spend money on alcohol next year? The
answer is no.

This year approximately $7,000, out of a total budget of
$84,861, was allocated to buy alcohol, representing 8.4 per
cent of the entire budget. This sum is a rnisallocation of
funds which SGA cannot afford to repeat next year.

It is the duty of SGA to disburse lunds Iwhich are
comprised of a $65 activity fee from each student) in a
responsible manner. $85,000 is not a lot of money considering
the services SGA must provide. The expenditure of nearly 10
per cent of that figure on an item that any student can easily
and cheaply purchase for himself makes little sense. Why
not allocate the money for projects where “the product" can
not be purchased on an individual basis, such as public
events, movies, and concerts?

The activity fee has not been increased for next year, yet
costs in most areas are going up. Some areas of present
expenditure will have to be cut just to retain the present level
of service.

SGA expenditures on alcohol should be the first go go.

Large all-campus parties such as the Loose Hall Ball and
the James Gang Bang are traditional facets of Grinnell social
life that should continue. But SGA should not continue to
supply free booze to the entire campus.

Although SGA could not sell alcohol because of licensing
restrictions, the Pub probably could, and at a relatively low
cost. This plan merits further investigation, for, if im-
plemented, aLrnost 10 per cent of SGA’s budget would be
freed to finance other activities.

The SGA Finance Committee is currently preparing
recommendations to submit to Joint Board for allocations of
next year's funds. One recommendation should be to cut
alcohol from the budget.

Imperial
presidency? ‘

Joint Board members approved one constitutional
amendment and defeated another one Wednesday night.
They should have passed them both.

The amendment they approved stipulates that hall
representative elections be held at the beginning of second
semester as well as at the end of each year. Such a change is a
positive one because an additional hall rep election will in-
crease hall rep accountability to hall members, It will also
increase interest in past and future Joint Board actions.

Freshmen and second semester returnees would be in-
cluded in the selection process as a result of the new
amendment. Second semester, all members of the hall will be
more knowledgeable about the people that live around them
and better able to select an appropriate person to represent
them on Joint Board.

Though continuity may suffer somewhat and some
bureaucratic hassles may result from any necessary new
committee assignments second semester, the benefits of the
amendment are such that we recommend a yes vote when an
all-campus referendum is held sometime during the next
couple of weeks.

The amendment that Joint Board voted down,but should
have passed, is the one abolishing the pri ilege of the SGA
president and vice president to choose their rooms before the
rest of the students that live on campus.

These two officers choose to assume Ll, duties of their
respective offices and receive salary compensation lad-
mittedly minimal, but some of the rest of us are working for
peanuts as well] for their work. They are not entitled to and
do not need special room draw privileges. Neither the
location nor the size of their rooms has anything to do with
administrative efficiency. Personal telephones are adequate
for communication and the SGA offices provide ample
meeting space.

Jon Neiderbach and Linda Cornelius should decline to pick
their rooms before room draw. More than a nice gesture. it
would improve their image and build their student support.

Sure signs of spring: The swallows return to Capistrano. the buzzards return to Hinckley (Ohio). and “169»
students return to the Forum terrace.

 

Cooperation instead of competition ‘

To the Editor:
A public letter to Mr. Rowat:

Your letter of 478777 proposes the
idea that personal growth and
development can be achieved by
“the challenges of competition." it
is disappointing that many people
in our society agree on this concept
of competition providing the
motivation to achieve and the
notion that challenges lead to
success or failure.

But what about the implications
of such propaganda? Indeed, you
fail to understand any of the
principles oi learning and
motivation or you would realize
that challenges and conflict are not
an essential stimulus to elicit a
person’s response and per-
formance. Yet many people like
yourself have continued to
brainwash other people into
working against each other instead

of with each other. This concept of
competition seems to me to be a
common theme in history and one
which had led to aggression, war,
and insane selfishness. I cannot
rationalize any amount of per-
sonal accomplishment through
competitive actions when the
nature of such involvement is
contrary to the progress of har-
many, friendship and human
cooperation,

If we encourage such physical
competition and involvement,
what will become of our ability to
develop our minds and to think?
Athletics and physical exercise
should have its “true purpose" in
developing the organism’s
physical level of optimal
homeostasis. Just as mental
practice is for the purpose of
mental development, physical
practice is for the purpose of

physical development. Your letter
implies that the “true purpose" of
athletics is to gain emotional and
psychological accomplishments by
meeting the “challenges of com~
petition”, and to measure our
ability to overcome pressures, yet
it remains clearly apparent that
we can gain and measure our
accomplishments without the
element of competition, Your
notion of athletic challenges
assumes the lack of any possible
personal motivation arising by
itself.

If man is to survive then we must
work openrmindedly toward that
end. if we spend our time
wastefully competing against one
another we will never become
united but will remain polarized‘
through conilict and unnecessarily
limit our awareness of human
potential—Louis Ganousis

Provide more Passover foods

To the editor: i believe the failure
of the Food Service to provide
adequate preparation for this
Jewish Holiday can be directly
traced to a misunderstanding as to
the relationship between religious
requirements and the respon-
sibility of the Food Service.

Upon the realization that the
purchases made for the Passover
Observance would be insufficient
to meet demand, Mr. McConnell
explained that one, students oi
other faiths were treating
Passover food as a snack which
accounted for the unexpectedly
high consumption level, and that
two, the Food Service was not
willing to remedy this situation
because of financial cone
siderations. I believe Mr, Mc~
Connell suggested that an ad-
ditional $1,000 Would have to be
spent beyond their present outlays
to accomodate the demand for
special Passover foods.

I believe that this position,
although sincerely held, cannot be
supported considering the present
set of commitments the Food
Service provides to other religious
groups and nationalities. Twice a
year the Food Service prepares
elaborate celebrations for
Christian holidays and does not,
under the guise of financial con
siderations, restrict those of other
religious persuasions from en-
joying these meals, Furthermore,

Taylor
misrepresented

To the editor: Due to a misunr
derstanding l was misquoted in the
April 3 issue of the see as saying
that I “was as well qualified to
judge the competency of a can-
didale as the professors on the
history faculty ” What 1 in fact
said was that l was qualified to
have an opinion regarding the
academic qualificatlons of lhe
candidates that should be

 

on other occasions during the year
the Food Service provides special
ethnic meals and is able to either
bury its costs or receive adequate
compensation for its efforts.

The Food Services' respon-
sibility to provide the necessary
food for Jewish holidays cannot be
viewed in the second light,
discretionary, but must be viewed
as an obligation to Jewish Students
who comprise close to thirty per
cent of the student body. Because a
portion of that number do not
choose to observe Passover
strictly, that Should not be con
strued as to give the Food Service
discretionary power in deter-
mining whaf numberlcan or cannot
participate.

There is another aspect which
puts this issue into a proper per-

 

spectiye. The observance of
Passover does not necessitate the
purchase of any food other than
matzoh. The only requirement,
that the Food Service ca ‘*
reasonably be expected to fulfill, is
that yeast and pork not be used
and that milk and meat not be
mixed in the preparation of Jewish
food, These requiremens do not ' *
beyond the realm of practicality,
the Food Service does not have to
serve its meat on bread and is free
to serve chicken and other basic
foods, which are currently on the
menu, without incurring any
additional costs.

i sincerely hope that these
problems will be resolved so that
this situation does not arise again.
