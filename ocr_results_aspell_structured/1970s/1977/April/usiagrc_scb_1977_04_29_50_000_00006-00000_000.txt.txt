Affirmative
acﬁon

lcontinued trom page 1)

Both Lei Ann Marshall and Scott
McMurray, student members of
the Ad-hoc Committee, expressed
a desire for more student
representation on the committee.
However, they both explained that
they recognized that the faculty
members should have the most
weight on the committee.

The program states that the
Advisory Committee should be
informed about matters con-
cerning affirmative action at the
college and make policy recom-
mendations to the president.
When it receives reports of
violations of established college
procedures it is empowered to
determine the facts to its
satisfaction and take steps that it
believes appropriate to inform me
college community of its findings.

Publicity is the only sanction
which the committee can impose
when it believes procedures are not
being followed. Therefore, as
Roberta Atwell and Tracy Huling,
faculty and student members of
the Adrhoc Committee, resped
tively, both explained, the success
of the program is contingenton the
good faith of the campus com-
munity.

Huling thinks the program is an
excellent one. “I think it in-
corporates very well the major
concerns of the committee,” she
commented, “The whole proposal
commits the college to extra effort

the Ad-hoc Committee, thinks that
the program is a good piece of
work. However, he expressed
frustration at the limited scope of
such a program. “The frustrating
thing is that so little can be done to
increase the number of women and
blacks on the faculty,” he ex-
plained.

Kissane said there is no reason to
expect the program to accomplish
anything dramatic. “The best
thing that can be said for it is that it
ought to improve our future hiring
process. It won't be very effective
in redressing the balance," he
explained,

Besides Atwell, Eysenbach,
Huling, Kissane, Marshall and
McMurray, members of the Ad
hoc Advisory Committee included
Patricia Brenner, LaVerne Durkee
and Glenton Davis.

Eysenbach’s report stata that
the status of women and minority
employees at Grinnell is not what it
should be.

The document reports that 12 of
the 99 regular faculty positions are
held by women. Only four women
are tenured; professors Noble and
Percas de Ponseti in Spanish;
associate professors Atwell in
education and Wack in physical
education. This puts the per
centage of tenured women faculty
at 7 per cent of the total. According
to Eysenbach’s report, this
number is no higher than it was 10
years ago.

Though 20 per cent of untenured
instructor and assistant professor
positions are held by women, this

 

implying extra money and extra
resources to redress past wrongs."
Jim Kissane, faculty member of

figure is still 6 per cent below the
expected numbers in these ranks,
when the number of female PhD.

 

recipients between 1970-5 is con
sidered. Eysenbach concluded,
“Thus the higher percentage of
women in the bottom ranks at
Grinnell is not sufficiently large to
rectify the imbalance in the
tenured ranks.”

Because three of the four tenured
women will retire in the next ten
years, the report states,
“ ‘Business-as»usual' for the next
ten years will result in a Grinnell
tenured faculty in 1937 which is Still
85 to 90 per cent male and white."

0n the other hand, Grinnell has
done well in hiring minority group
members with respect to the
potential pool of applicans. The
report states, “Minority group
members are 7 per cent of the
Grinnell faculty this year, . This
figure may be compared to the
estimate that minority persons
have earned about 6 per cent of the
total of recent Ph.D’s in fields
taught at Grinnell.”

However, at present, there will
be only two black faculty members
on campus next year, Rogers
Guirira and Charlie Davis.

In her report, Eysenbach states
that there does not seem to be
salary discrimination against
women in faculty positions, but
that salaries have not been used to
attract women and faculty to the
college.

However, women among
professional staff members
generally receive the lowest pay in
each of five categories of authority
and responsibility, the report
states. Dean Waldo Walker said
that a significant number of these
salaries have been raised for next
year.

KING or EEERSe

An Italian masterpiece;
an American musical ‘

by Peter Jaroff

Bernardo Bertolucci is one of the
most talented and controversial
directors in film today. The 36
yearrold filmmaker already has to
his credit Before the Revolution,
The Contarmisl (my allrtime
favorite movie). and Last Tango in
Paris. In The Spider‘s Strategy
(1970), Bertolucci demonstrates
the form and techniques which
have made his films exciting and
provocative,

Bertolucci used a Borges short
story entitled The Theme of the
Traitor and the Hero as the basis
for the plot, Athos Magnani, Jr.
returns to the little Northern
ltalian town where his father, the
anti-fascist leader Athos Magnani,
Sr., was assassinated some thirty
years earlier. Athos, who bears an
identical resemblance to his
famous father, has been called
back by his father’s mistress, who
feels that the assassin still lurks at
large in that very town. Athos
resists getting involved in the
mystery, but before long he is
swallowed up in his father's
legend, and becomes inextricably
involved. His discoveries throw
new light on the activities of his
father and his father's comrades,
and Athos’s search ends with a
surprising turnabout.

Admittedly, the plot does lack
something when compared with
the best mysteries or suspense
thrillers. But Bertolucci more than
compensates for the weaknesses of
the plot. Perhaps more than any
other director, Bertolucci knows
how to exploit all the potentials of
color photography. The S ider’s
Strategy makes the highly-touted
B y Lyndon look like it was
filmed in blackrandrwhite. It is a
little-known, seldomrseen but
deeply beautiful film, and well
worth your while.

 

Meet Me In st. Louis (1944) i5
one of those movies which will
delight some people with its in-
nocence and light-heartedness and
nauseate others with its sugary
sentimentality. Whether it delights
or dismays, this film represents a
genre unique to American filmA
the movie musical. Vincente
Minelli directed this old chestnut,
which stars Judy Garland, Mary
Astor, Leon Ames, and sevenryearr
old Margaret O'Brien, who drew
rave reviews for her engaging g
performance. _\

The Smith family lives in St.
Louis in 1903, the year before that
city hosted the World’s Fair. Mr.
Smith wants to move his business
to New York, but his family, for a
variety of reasons, protests. That‘s
not the whole story, but it’s pretty
close to it. It would be unfair,
however, to ignore the songs and
settings which really make the
movie work.

Minelli, along with Stanley
Donen (Seven Brides for Seven
Brothers) and Charles Walters
(Easter Parade) was responsible
for the regeneration of the movie
musical in the 1940’s and ’50’s. As
an example of that genre, Meet Me
in St. Louis is a nostalgic,
exuberant salute to America"
past. .

A collection of early Walt Disney
cartoons will be shown twice this
weekent, on Saturday night before \
The Spider’s Strategy and «73‘
Sunday night before Meet Me In
St. Louis. This collection includes
“Skeleton Dance” and other “Silly
Symphonies." Take advantage of
this chance to see Disney’s work
prior to the cutesy an-
thropormorphism of Bambi or the
banality of Charlie the Lonesome
Cougar and the like. (An-
thropormorphismrlike that, huh?)
