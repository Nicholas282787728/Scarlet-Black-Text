Consuming beer is obviously a
rare means to any productive end.
Qowever, one talented and en-
terprising professional actor has
harnessed this popular indulgence
to add weight while characterizing
Falstaff for the Grinnell College
Theatre Department’s presen-

tation of Shakespeare's Henry lv,
Part I.

Jim Baker, the dedicated per-
former just described, has por-
trayed characters ranging from
Ben in The Sunshine Boys to the
title role In Macbeth. He has
erformed with such renowned

mpanies as the Oregon
Shakespearean Festival, The
Guthrie Theatre and most
recently, the Milwaukee Repertory
" mpany.
. Jim and his wife, Mary, have
been here since Monday and will
remain until May 9th. Before our
interview began, both chimed
enthusiastically that Grinnell “is
such a pleasure compared to the
city." They had just finished a
round of golf, exhilarated,
refreshingly inquisitive about my
interests and those of my
photographer and most responsive
to questions.

A native of Conrad, Montana,

Jim became interested in acting‘

from the moment he performed in

his first high school play senior
year. Since then, his involvement
in theatre has intensified with
every role. “Every role I've played
has affected me," he commented.
Mary added, “He’s constantly
working, his mind is always active.
It's amazing.” Along with acting,
Jim has directed educational
theatre

Commenting on actors and
acting, Jim pointed out that he
hasn’t taken a break since 1969. He
lava what he’s doing. Mary, ad-
mitting she was initially hesitant
about the acting profession,
stressed that it is “the most valid
lifestyle I've seen,” specifically
noting how honest and receptive

“It‘s a great lifestyle," she
continued. “You‘re constantly
moving and you discover how little
you really need." She told how
after marrying Jim, they threw
open their moving van doors and
said to Mary‘s eight brothers and
sisters, “Help yourselves.” They
haven’t seen those possessions
since. Now, along with the
essentials, they have only their
cooler, goli clubs and television on
the road.

Referring to specific stereotypes
placed on actors, Jim mentioned
that most of his actor friends are
homosexual. However, he said
that such a fact doesn't
necessarily support the stereotype
that all male actors are
homosexuals. He dismissed the
eccentricity often attributed to
actors as false, but explained that
actors cannot get credit cards
because creditors feel acting is so
transient as to render it risky.
Basically, though, Jim doesn’t see
too many stereotypes,

He then proceeded to relate how
he happened to be contacted to
come and work with Grinnell
Students: ”Sandy (Moffett) had
seen me as Volpone with the
Milwaukee Rep, knew I had played
Falstaff before and asked me if I
was interested.” Jim was in
terested and here he is.

Jim has worked with students
before in the American Cone
Servatory Theatre and the Pacific
Conservatory of Performing Arts,
among others.

According to him, there is a
substantial difference between
professional and student
productions. in a professional
production there is a defined

astuteness in directing.

No production difficulties have
cropped up yet, Moffett and Jim
both agreed that Shakespeare is
challenging. Jim humorously
revealed his adoption of
Shakespeare: “Shakespeare
scared the hell out of me the first
time I read him. The first time I
saw him (performed), it made all
the difference. Now he doesn‘t
scare me at all, I‘m just intrigued
all the time."

Discussing the play itself, Jim
emphasized that While it contains

Montgomery, as a direct result of
last fall’s campus-wide referen-
dum on whether FOG (Food Of
Grinnelll Should boycott non-UFW
lettuce. At that time Montgomery
called Dennis Ryan, of the Iowa
City Boycott Committee, to learn
where union lettuce could be ob-
tained, Ryan remembered the call
and this spring made a request of
his own: to hold a statewide sup-
port meeting at the college.

Why Grinnell? The School is “not
exactly a bastion of union ac
tivity," admitted Montgomery.
But it is centrally located in Iowa.

Grinnell students were welcome
to participate in all the day's ac-
tlvities, which included a morning
meeting, lunch at Amos Gottlieb's
house, a speechﬁssentially a
question and answer period—on
migrant workers in lowa and a
film: “Viva la Causal” Several
Grinnellians attended the morning
meetings and several more joined
the discussion on migrant workers,
which was led by Lando Valadez,
of the DesVMoines based Iowa
Boycott Committee.

Perhaps the gorgeous weather
dissuaded students from stopping
inside South Lounge to listen,
although a table setup outside the
forum bearing UFW leafleb and
buttons attracted some interest.

Perhaps, too, a certain confusion
over the issues involved kept
Grinnelllans away, All those

continue to represent workers in
the agricultural transportation
industry. But it Still remains for
the California growers to negotiate
contracts with UFW Many
growers are abiding by previous
agreements made with the
Teamsters, or are employing
workers who are represented by no
union at all.

Thus, although “a good pere
cenmge of the population thinks
that the boycott has ended," only
30 per cent of California lettuce is
UFW-picked, according to a
participant in the conference. The
boycott is to be phased out
gradually, as more and more
growers sign UFW contracts.
Many are reluctant to sign.

Grinneli Students were as well or
better represented at the meeting
as their Iowa counterparts. A
woman from University of Nor-
them Iowa remarked that she was
the only union supporter on
campus and that her support ac
tivity consisted of dropping daily
resolutions into the food service
suggestion box urging that it
boycott noanFW lettuce.
