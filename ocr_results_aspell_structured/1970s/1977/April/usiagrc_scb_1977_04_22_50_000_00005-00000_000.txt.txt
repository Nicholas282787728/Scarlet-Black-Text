A“

by Matt Cohen

The phrase “imperial
presidency” became popular
during the Nixon years, a time of
Prussian»suited White House
guards, of paranoid White House
staff, and of leadership dedicated
not to the public at large, but to the
special few who made large con-

mindset and country club mem-
bership. It is thus unfortunate
indeed that the editors of tile 5&3
would even risk implying that
there is an SGA “imperial
sidency” at Grinnell.
\ There are really two issues in-
volved in my concern about the
editorial entitled “Imperial
Presidency?" My initial response
who cares that the President and
_ VP. get preference in room draw!
Given the variety of problems and
potentials of Grinnell, there seem
to be better topics to editorialize
about, For example, the 5&3

 

tributions or possessed the right'

i editors might discuss the
possibility of a midyear vote of
confidence for the SGA President
and v.l>., as has been proposed for
Hall Representatives and Coor-
dinators. But to equate preference
in room draw with an “imperial
presidency” seems ridiculous
indeed.

There is a more important issue
involved, however, and it concerns
the \v‘ ingness of the Grinnell
campus to, accept and support its
leaders.

My impression has been that this
year's SGA president. Ruth
Montgomery, despite some
mistakes or oversights, has done
more to avoid die trappings of an
“imperial presidency” than any
other SGA presidentof the last four
years. What is regrettable is that
Ruth’s effectiveness has been
limited by the unwillingness of the
student body to provide their
support,

For example, the 8&3 has ac-
tively refrained from the sort of
cooperation with the SGA cabinet
which might have enhanced the
effectiveness of each and
minimized duplication of effort.
Attempts to have announcements
of SGA activities appear have
frequently failed, making it harder
to escape the charge that son is
isolated and doesn't solicit student
input. Overture: by the cabinet
aimed at cooperation on in-
vestigations or objectives have
met with considerable resistance.
In one case, a .survey by the
Student Coordinator’s Office on
Off-Campus Housing and an in-
vestigative report by the SM;

occurred simultaneously, with no
knowledge on the part of either
group as to the activities of the
other. A more recent example is
the editoral on Booze, also in last
week’s 5&8, which might have
incorporated the current efforts of
the Counseling Committee to
develop a policy promoting
responsible use of alcohol on
campus.

Admittedly, fault lies with the
Cabinet as Well as the 5&3, and the
SM; has effectively treated a

'variety of important campus

problems. The concern remains.
however, that a fear seems to exist
of being overly cooperative, of
risking compromising exclusive
credit for a story, or of a loss of
objectivity by virtue of cooperation
with SGA. The SGA leadership and
the 5&3 are both outlets for and
advocates of student concerns, and
should recognize their common
interests and objectives.

At the same time, the Joint
Board has all too often both refused
to accept the leadership of the
Cabinet and refused to demon
strate leadership themselves.
Here, too, the Cabinet. and par-
ticularly the Student Coordinator's
Office, might have worked harder
to develop a cooperative rather
than adversary relationship with
Joint Board. Nonetheless, many
attempts to receive input,
suggestions, and feedback from
Joint Board have met with little
success. While some members
have been responsible voices for
the concerns of their halls,
requests for input from the reps
on such issues as the

The social consciences of
ﬁlleges such as Grinnell often
.. c'm capricious and even fickle.
Like a social butterfly at a dance,
we flirt first with one “cause” and
then another, ﬂitting away when

novelty wears off and the
relationship begins to demand
more than we care to give.

One “cause" which perhaps has
managed to hold our attention
better than most is the effort to
achieve equality. This concern has
taken several different forms;
equality for blacks and other racial
minorities, equality for women,
and equal opportunity for people of
varying political and religious
pgrsuasions being the examples
"t come most readily to mind.
G nell was founded by an
abolitionist, was one of the first
a ges to become coeducational,
is admitted blacks shortly before
the end of the Civil War. The
present nature of the campus is
stringently egalitarian. Elite
fraternities or sororities would
not be tolerated at Grinnell. Even
the mildest forms of distinction are
accepted with some em»
barrassment.

All this is not to say that the
college has achieved equality in all
respects, for it clearly has not.
Many controversies over the past
few years have demonstrated this
ﬁne, but they have also
demonstrated that the college does
possess a conscience which is
sensitive to inequality.

We have seen fit to judge people,
nton the basis of race, sex, or
re.lgion, but rather on the basis of
merit. We have thought it unfair to
exclude anyone for any reason not
somehow reflective of their
character or worth as an in-
dividual. Nor would we give
preferred treatment to anyone as a
resultof their wealth, social status,
or other characteristics for which
an individual cannot claim credit.

While we subscribe to such

notions of equality, our concrete
commitment to them is
questionable. For all of our
professed dedication to equality
and our abhorrence of anything
remotely resembling aristocratic
elitism, the college nonetheless
perpetuates a system which
inherently and unjustly denies
equal opportunity.

I am referring to the manner in
which the college selects,
evaluates, and rewards its
students. These functions are
performed without any regard to
the individual worth of a person,
and are based solely upon their
intellectual ability. Intellectual
ability isa characteristic for which
a student can claim no credit, a
characteristic which is not
reflective of strength of character
or of merit.

By merit, I mean the sort of
qual‘ 'es in a person that we might
intuitively recognize as having
been obtained through that per-
sons effort, rather than having
been come by naturally with no
effort. 1 mean the sort of quality in
a person that we might intuitively
respect, rather than stand in awe
of, as we might stand in awe of
someone’s size or shape. Qualities
such as integrity, courage,
diligence. and concern are
examples of what i consider
meritorious. A student who obtains
an “A" with little effort is not
meritorious in this respect, while a
student who gets a “C" after a
maximum‘effort would be, ln-
tellectual ability is no more a just
basis for the judgment of in
dividuals than is athletic ability,
sexual prowess, or any other
talent.

I do not deny that the effort and
attitude devoted to the realization
of an individual’s intellectual
potential are valid criteria by
which to judge someone. Grinnell
makes no attempt to judge people

 

in this manner. however. One may
speculate that the present methods

 

of selection and evaluation might
somehow loosely and indirectly
mirror merit, but this is not certain
and my own feeling is that they do
not.

I realize that thoughts such as
these are utter heresy, and are in
conﬂict with what most people
would conceive of as the purpose of
the college. But the purpose of the
college is education. We have not
interpreted that to mean just the
education of white, AngloSaxon,
men, but we have interpreted it to
mean just the education of smart
people.

The college‘s admissions
material used to include a quote
from Donald Kaul's column that
said, ”It’s not so hard to turn out
smart graduates when you just let
smart kids into your school in the
first place. ” The quote made sense
to me, but I couldn’t understand
why the college would include it in
its official publications, since the
statement implies that we are
actually an ineffectual and elitist
institution. The statement was
made by Kaul when he granted
Grinnell Iowa’s Most Overrated
College Award,

It seems to me that we have no
reason to be proud of the college if
all it can claim to do is supervise
smart students as they accumulate
enough academic regalia to be
awarded a degree. The education
of the already intelligent seems not
an overly difficult task. Our real
challenge lies in me education of
people of all levels of abilities,
rather than in the continuation of
the clubby elitism of the socalled
intelligentsia. If we are indeed
committed to equality, and if we
are indeed an institution whose
purpose is education, then the
selection and evaluation of
students will be made solely on the
basis of merit, and not. on the un-
fair basis ol innate intelligence, I
suspect that this would be more
than we would care to give to the
cause of equality, however.

reorganization and the White
Paper, prior to Cabinet presenr
tations to the trustees, have gone
unanswered.

Where the Cabinet has in
troduced issues or proposals for
consideration, we have often
encountered either passive
acquiescence or active suspicion
that we were trying to railroad our
ideas. Often the complaint has
been heard from Joint Board
members that we have failed to
consult with them sufficiently, but
Joint Board members are relucA
tant to volunteer when requests for
assistance or input are made.
Again, leadership cannot occur
unless reps are willing to be in-
volved, take the risk of trusting the
leadership, and demonstrate their
own leadership through their
willingness to discover and ar»
ticulate hall concerns and
cooperate with the Cabinet in
addressing those concerns.

The fault does not lie only with
the Joint Board reps themselves
however. in may cases, hall
members are unwilling to devote
the time and thought to provide
their reps with the input they
require in order to be effective.
Students rarely approach their
representatives to express their
concerns about a particular issue.
Moreover, representatives are
rarely challenged when they fail to
provide information about SGA
activities and proposals or fail to
solicit feedback on campus issues
from dorm members. Regrettably,
many students are either apathetic
or unwilling to accept and support
the leaders in their halls,

from the student body.

In fact, one wonders whether
President Turner could ever be an
effective leader at Grinnell. In
addition to a series of stylistic,
political, and philosophical errors
for which blame must be laid with
the President, Turner's ef-
fectiveness is also severely hin-
dered by the hesitancy of any
campus constituency, even prior
to the reorganization, to give his
ideas a fair evaluation. Attempts to
legislate, to change, to redirect

stituencies on campus—the

respond with suspicion and
closed-mindedness. Each con-
stituency is wary of threats to its
turf. Each assumes an ulterior
motive on the part of the initiator
of the proposed change. While
there may at times be grounds for
suspicion, the campus seems so
preoccupied with suspicion that it
fails to see any forest through the
trees. Healthy evaluation is im-
portant, but the amount of time
and energy devoted to finding
things to be suspicious about is
detrimental to the interests of the
college.

If Grinnell is to be called a
community, we must continue the
precedent established by Ruth
Montgomery’s SGA Presidency of
openness, honesty, and sensitivity
to all segments of the campus,
rather than establish leadership
based on personal gratification or
desire to enter law school. We must
develop a College Presidency
based on candidness, interaction,
foresight, and community
cooperation, rather than a
Presidency of isolation, mutual
distrust, and decisive in-
decisiveness. Finally, we must
have a faculty capable of putting
the interest of the college as a
whole before their interests as
individuals or as a collective body.
In a community with few women
staff and a rapidly disappearing
black staff, with tough and growing
economic constraints, and with an
unsureness as to our purpose or
role, we must ‘ask hard and far
reaching questions and we must
give the college leadership can
structive support.

“Imperial,” according t
Webster's Dictionary, implies a
special -nr superior position' ‘or
belief, Grinnell can ill»afford either
constituencies which believe
themselves to be in an imperia
position or misleading accusation
as to the existence of such bodies.
The challenge for this campus is t
transcend the petty backrstabbing,
political infighting, or indifference
and develop instead a communit
characterized by mutual respect,
constructive thought and criticism,
and shared purpose.
