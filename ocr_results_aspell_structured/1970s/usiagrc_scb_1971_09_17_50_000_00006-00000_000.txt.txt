The Iowa Open was held two
weeks ago at the Montrosc HoV
tel in Cedar Rapids. This
annual event is sponsored by
the Iowa Chess Association.
Prof. Arnold Adclberg and I
were among the competitors
in the ‘Open’ section. l\s of
5:00 p.m. Sunday there were
three undefeated players (nei-
ther of them Prof. Adclberg
or myself), and another com-
petitor for first place stillhad
an uncompleated game from a
previous round. Prof. Adele
berg had a respectable score
of three wins and two losses,
one ofthe latter beingto Iowa’s
top ranked player, Jon
Fraukle. The following is a
rather pretty game from the
tournament in which Black’s—-

Part Two of the Report outs
lines the difficulties facing the
college as it attempts to rev
cruit black faculty members,
administrators, and resident
advisors.

The report also notes a dis-
parity in the numberofwomen
presently holding teaching or
administrative positions, sta-
ting that, “Social and econor
mic mores in the United Sta-
tes have. until recently, been
such as to deny equality of
opportunity to women except
where suffrage is concerned.
The college admittedly has
work to do and Will stive to
fulfill its responsibilities and
to comply with Fedcral and
other requirements."

Part Three of the report
deals With contractors work—
ing on projects for the col7
lege. Specifically mentioned
are Gilbert Builders, Inc.,
the prime contractor for the
new physical education com-
plex, and Saga Food Service.

Uniﬁed effort

The report states that Gilt
bert employed one black and
two Indians on the PE com,
plex, and was asked in a
letter from College Vice Pro-
sident, Donald Lambie, [UPI'O’

ploys five part time black
students among 140 workers,
although none of its 40 full

ficulties in convincing black
workers to relocate in Grin'

causes of this problem.

allowmg visitors on campus,
conferring awards, and invit-
ing guest performers and lece
turers is the subject of Part
Four of the report. it is also
noted that a policy of non-
discrimination has always
been standard for members of
visiting athletic teams.

Part Five of the report takes
note of continuingharassment,
overt and Otherwise, which
black Students have undergone
in the city of Grinnell. The
establishment of the Grinnell
Human Rights Commission
will hopefully help alleviate
this problem.

The conclusion of the re

port states seven goals for

the future:

1. That current recruit‘ngproV
cedures continue until the
student body is composed of
at least 10% minority stu»
dents.

2.That recruiting procedures
be expanded for the adminie
stration and faculty, with the
same 10% goal in mind.

3.That any discrimination a»
gainst women in college hire
ing, promOtion, or salary
practices be eliminated, and
that the number of women in
faculty and administration
positions be increased by 10%
in the next four years.

4.That an active recruitment
program be begun to bring
minority group members ins
to employment on the cleric
cal, service, and physical
plant staffs.

5.That the college insist on
documented evidence from

BUDGET

How much is an SGA cabinet
officer worth? Mario Bognair
no proposed that the Finance
Committee should “call them
in, and ask them what the
Job consists of," l\ boisterous
round ofhooV hahs ellSUCL! from
the radio staff. Shybut ex-
plained the Committee’s ra-
tionale for the equalized SEI!’
ary levels, namely that there
is HI‘lO valid criteria" for
determining what anybody will
be worth,-and that salaries
are “token payments" any*
way.

n um 1011ch

B rather Tom

Bill Thomas supported Shyr

but's argument by pointing
out that the quality of past
SGA presidents has varied
considerably, and that it is
impossible to tell ahead of
time the kind of job a stu-
dent body president will do.
The SCA President of three
years ago, he noted, did a
fine job and probably descr-
ved more than his salary, but
the very ne>tt year Jim Lew
deserved far less. A few spec-
tators were hears to observe
that the outstanding SG‘\1’71”
esidcnt in Thomas's xaniple
was, of course, his brother
Tom.

R eferendum?

Bob Sparks related this sale
ary dispute with the previous
one concerning the radio sta—
tion, again addressing himr
self to the question of by what
arbitrary process salaries
should be set. lie suggested
a “referendum to the student
body as a whole", which br'
ought forth spontaneous apple
ausc from all but Phil Sass
ich, who complained that aim-
rage students would have no
idea as to what the salary lee
vcls should be. General cons
sensus was that he missed
the point.

Shybut, after a quick con*
ference with his Committee
members, quickly came out
in support of the Sparks proV
posal, noting that the Board
~ ould "let the students de-
Cidc...it's their money!”

Nobody else seemed to take
the suggestion seriously, hoW'
ever, and the debate ended with
nothing scltletl. Sasich's mo
tion to raise Shelley‘s salary
was defeated and so was one

by vian‘iéhg‘r‘ﬁﬁﬂlse all sala-
rics to $400.

Benjie Katz pointedly asked,
"Why raise salaries at all?
They couldn't do it for the
money...Jcsus Christ! Why,
they just make the sameasthc
radio station staff." Sparks
was heard to murmur “But
we aren't making anything rir
ght now," which produced
scattered bursts of laughter.
The last bit of business was
to briefly debate upon andpass
:i motion to raise the SGA
secretary’s salary to $100 a
year from the Finance Com-
mitteo's recommendauon of
$50. Secretary Ellen Yacknin,
madly scribbling that down in
her notes, was seen to smile
for the first time during the
meeting.
