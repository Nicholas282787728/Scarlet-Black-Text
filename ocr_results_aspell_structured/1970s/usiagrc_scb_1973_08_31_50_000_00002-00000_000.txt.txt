HOUSING TIGHT

'No’ Vacancies

by Ellyn Toscano

”Extremely tight housing condi-
tions” exist at Grinnell this fall
according to the Tssistant Dean
of Student Affairs, Bob Jacobs. He
attributes this to a lower attrition
rate.

Jacobs reported that although there
is no noticeable shortage of furni-
ture, proper distribution has not
been achieved>lle also commented
on the fact that some students failed
to return borrowed furniture.

As it stands now, some double
rooms have only one dresser. Ja-

cobs remarked that in this type of
situation, drawer space in the desks
would compensate for the lack of
dresser drawers.

At this time, there are only six
single rooms availabe with approxi—
mately 25 requests pending. Al-
though it is possible, transferring
rooms at this time will be very
difficult. Jacobs speculated that
these conditions will be eased by
the end of the week as the number
of students returning to Grinnell
is ascertained.

the all campus paper recycling drive

LEAP leapt into action in its first
year by compiling an ace-action
handbook for the college, as well
as investigating the residential heat-
ing system, converting the vending
machines to bottled drinks, creat-
ing the ride board, and preparing
radio programs.

In the community ofGrinnell, LEAP

Volunteer Bureau Formed

by Liz Sexton

A group of Grinnell residents are
involved in the formation of a vols
unteer bureau, under the leadership
of Don Schild, a Grinnellrattorney.
Schild said that the idea behind the
organization is ”to discover talents
among all citizens ofthecommunity,
assist in arranging for their utilir
zation and enable various organizar
tions and agencies, including schor
ols, to enrich and supplement pre
sent experiences and opportunities
offered through the use of volun-
teers."

Schild added that often volunteers
do not get to participate in programs
best Snited to their abilities, Also
many of the methods of recruiting
are haphazard and inefficient. The
bureau hopes to coordinate these
efforts, and help vpotential volunr

teei-s find their place.

in general Grinnell College has an
excellent record in supplyingvolun-
teers. Bill Deminoff, Director of
College Relations and an original
founder of the bureau, hopes to set
up a meansby which students can
volunteer their services

ln an interview he pointed out that,
for many college students, volunte-
ering is a way of life. He said

that students need to be needed and
involved. The Volunteer Bureau

hopes to allow these students an
opportunity to have their talents
utilized. ‘

As the bureau is still in the plan-
ning stage, no office has been set
up yet. More organizational meet-
ings are planned to crystallze the
bureau's plans.

problems in Jasper County.

The initial purpose of LEAP as
stated by Kenneth Christiansen was,
“to identify college environmental
problems, develop solutions.”

In April 1572 LEAP was dissolved,i
having fulfilled some of its goals
and failed in others. The SGA has
taken the responsibility of organiz-
ing the college’s paper recycling
collection. Wednesday night the SGA
appointed seniors Doug Halsey, John
Canfield and Susan Laier as co-or—
dlnators of this service for fall 1973.
Halsey said that, hopefully, aforce
of “one volunteer per hall floor”
will be working alongside, the co-
ordinators. They will see that the;
two clean paper deposit boxes on
each floor contain the appropiate
contents: newspapers in one and
ledger paper in the other. White
ledger paper includes nonrglossy
sheets printed with black ink‘of none
glossy unprinted material. A major
collection will take place once a
Week

A limited number of openings
remain in the Craft Workshops
Courses offered range from lea»
thercraft to relief printing, and
the cost is small.

Complete information is avail—
able from Nina Adams, phone
517.

The collected paper's destination
is Darby gym where more volunr
teers are needed to sort the paper,
and prepare the bundles for City
Carton Company in Iowa City. The
volunteers can then finally relax
and consume the provided refresh-

Econ Impact Studied

DES MOINESWA study of the eco—
nomic impact of Grinnell College on
the city of Grinnell was profiled
recently in an editorial in The Des
Moines Sunday Register.

The study, conducted by junior John
A. Hansen and recent graduate Ric—
hard J. Buddin under the Supervision
of Economics professor Robert
Voertman, revealed that about so
million of the city’s business volume
comes from the College

The editorial continues by noting
that there are so private colleges
and junior colleges in Iowa, and
that their estimated total economic
impact is $120 million.

Portions of the Grinnell economic
impact study have been reprinted
in various publications.

Reports Given To Faculty

by Brent Schondelmeyer

At the first faculty meeting of the
year, held last Friday in South
Lounge, Administrative and faculty
representatives 'outlined some of
their concerns and observations for
the coming year at the first faculty
meeting of the year, held last Fri»
day in South Lounge.

Chairman ufthefacultyPhilipKint-
her in his report to the faculty
noted a definite rise in the number
of high grades awarded at Grinnell
citing figures from 1964772. He
noted, however, son's concern with
the “Credit-Erase” grading sys-
tem and felt that it would be an
issue in the coming year,

President Glenn Leggett felt the
constant discussion of grading s‘ys-
terns was a waste of time feeling
that the competitive instinct was
in the people and nut in, the grade
ing system '

Dean Waldo Walker commenting
on the grading system felt that the
current system was adequate, but
“needs some more refining.” The
new grade system allowing students
to drop a course in which they
made lower than a C Walker felt
gave the student a "false sense of
security" disguising his academic
progress in credits earned.

Another area of common concern
was admission. Walker remarked,
“Admissions as far as Grinnell
College goes, becomes the #1 sure
vival problem” This was the first
year that the college admitted stu-
dents for the fall during the sum-
mer months. The current admiSr
sions picture is strong, but Wal-
ker cited demographic figures that
showed a decline in the number of
students available to colleges in the
next ten years.

In echoing the sentiments of Kintr

ner, Legget urged the faculty with
the COroperation of the administra-
tion to "look at some of our infl—
exibilities" and look for more me>
aningful approaches in academic
presentation. Legget told the fac-
ulty, “We’re better than our re-
sources should allow us to be."

Walker stated that despite the fact
the current operating budget closed
in the balance, there was a $1.1
million deficit in the physical plant
fund. The deficit has been com-
pounded by difficulties in holding
faculty and administration within
their budgets and the large number
of renovations required in various
building on campus in the last 0011’.
ple of years.

Much‘of' Kintner’s reportdealtwlth'
student—faculty relations, "The col
lege has been extremely fortunate in
having cool heads and flexible think-
ing at all levels.“ Remarking fur-
ther Kintner felt “it should be p0»
ssible to set forth precise limits
for both bodies, and to create a
new structure for campus govern—
ment which would carefully delim
student participation ” This he felt
however, would diminish student p0,
wer as the ”student power move-
ment appears to have passed its
peak, and to be declining.”

Commenting on the desirability of
new programs Kintnel‘ warned,
“New programs have a way of be--
coming permanent as faculty are
tenured; will they survive the sp
cious present only to becomet
bane of,existencc fur the next ge
neration of students?" Kintner did
not prefer the total revision of
curriculum characteristic of five
or six years ago but instead pre—
ferred ”a slower, safer method,
while recognizing that change is the
essence of education, as well a‘
history."
