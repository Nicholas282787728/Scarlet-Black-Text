Tracksters
Toke Third

by Chris Madson

The Indoor Conference Track Meet
has lost a little of the old sparkle
The title of the meet itself is a miss
nomer; St. Olaf, the number one
track power in the conterence has
not shown up for indoor Conference
in the last three years.

Cue won with 56 points on the strong
performances of their hurdlers and
sprinters, The University of
Chicago, a nonrconference entry,
took second with 63 points, and an
uninspired Grinnell squad scored 45
points for third place.

Grinnell distance men turned in
their usual solid performance in the
distance medley, three solid perforr
mances by John Hessburg, Dan
Hildebrand, and Phil Morales put
Chuck within fifteen yards Of the
Coe miler 0n the final leg ofthe race,
The Coe runnerdidn't have aprayei‘.

Chuck also came within a whisker
oi winning the twormile relay, too,
until the Coo anchor man fouled
him in the last fifteen yards of the
race, The officials wouldn’t diSr
qualify the Coe runner, however,
so the Grinnell win was only amoral
victory » satistying, maybe, but
not much of a help in the team
point totals.

The Scarlet and Black

McGrnth got his revenge in the
two»mile with an easy 9 52.8. The
only man near him dropped out oi
sight alter the first mile, and after
that chuck was all alone. As iar as
competition in the twormile goes,
that’s where Chuck is likely to stay,
too - way out ahead oi the pack.

The blow to the Pioneers’ scoring
came in the iield events, Grinnell’s
strong iield contingent succumbed
to mediocre winning performances.
Barry Huff couldn’t get unti-acked
and placed second behind a 4710”
Carleton toss, Dave Wright had to
settle for third in the long jump
even though the winning jump was
only 20'11”. Christ Madson had a
strong vault at 13’6” but took a
second behind the U. oi Chicago
vaulter who also edged Jim Plrolli
in the high jump with a 5’11” jump;
Jim’s best jump was 5’10”,

That was it, The kind of meet
we’d like to forget as soon as
possible,

Swimmers Upset In loop Meet

by Al Schoene

The favored Grinnell swim team
was upset by defending champion
Ripon in their bid for the Midwest
Conference championship last week.
end in Beloit. The final tally showed
Ripon on top by a margin of 273 to
251

The loss was a tough one for the
Pioneers who had several bad breaks
and problems with iatigue and pres
sure. on the whole, though, the
swimmers did an excellent job,
and probably deserved to win.

The opening event, the 400 medley
relay, was won by Grinnell in the
most exciting race or the meet as
Jim Carns withstood a withering
challenge from Ripon’s Bruce Hafi-
ner. Toni Rowat, Bob Winters, and
Mike Beye all swam excellent legs
on the relay

Mike Daley continued Grinnell’s
fast start by winning the next event,

the 200 freestyle in a time of 154.7.
Rowat and Winters then finished
third and fourth in the 200 individual
medley.

Steve Ward captured the Pioneer‘s
third victory with a strong 22.8
50 freestyle, Carns took fifth place
in the event,

Winters and John Fieckenstein took
third and eighth in the 200 back
stroke, and then came the first of
Grinnell's mishaps Due in large
part to a peculiarity in the structure
of the pool, Tom Rowat was disquallr
fled in the prelims of the 100 butter»
ily ior tailing to make a touch pro-
perly. Beye tinished twelfth.

ward and Beye took third and iiith
in the 100 breaststroke, and Daley
and Dan Weiss finished the day’s
events with third and tenth place
finishes in the 500 freestyle. At this
time the score stood at Ripon 159 ,
Grinnell 149,

B-Bttll Ends With losses

by Al Schoene

The Pioneer cagers ended their
season on the down-beat last
weekend as they lost to (Zoe and
Beloit in Darby Gymnasium. The
two defeats gave Grinnell a season
record of 5-16 overall and a con»
ference record of 444, good only
tor ninth place,

Against Cce Friday night, Grinnell
kept the game close until about mid-
way in the ilrst half, with the score
21-20 at one point. Everything fell
a‘part the rest oi the game as Coe
exploded to a 47—27 halHime lead
The game was never in doubt as
Coe coasted to a 90417 Victory.

The game wasn’t without its ex-
citing moments. The refs fouled out
Greg Bomblnski early, with his last
foul being called for letting himself
he run over by a driving Coe player.
Showing amazing quickness and agil-
ity, Coaches Boyd and Bowers
dashed onto the court to draw a
technical foul. Boyd also gave an
exhibition of semaphoring with a
white towel from the bench

Rick Faust suffered a knee injury

as he was blocked into the third
row going in for a lay-up. Despite
his valiant efforts he was unable to
remain in the game long enough to
get his iree throws.

The Beluit contest wasn’t the dis~
aster of the Coe game, but Grinnell
again came up short by a score of
52752. Down only by two points at
half-time, the Pioneers came back
from a 12 point deficit with about
14 minutes left, to close to Within
three at 50747, Grinnell was unable
to get the ball away from Beloit’s
slowdown at the end and let them
get a iew easy laysiips to cement
the victory

Bob Burnett was sorely missed in
both games, although Dennis Moss
put in two line performances scoring
15 and 18 points. Burnett finished
his college career with a fifth place
finish in the loop scoring race, but
just .2 oi a point per game behind
second place. Bob was easily the
top loop scorer over the past three
years with 952 points in the confer-
ence, but was never able to come up
with the scoring crown.

Troubles really set in on Saturday
as the pool’s filtering and ventilation
system malfunctioned, causmg poor
conditions. According to Mike Daley,
“it was like treading water ina large
bowl Of clam chowder.”

Weiss and Bob Brown took eighth
and tenth place finished in the 1000
freestyle and in the 100 back. Win-
ters took a second and Fleckenstein
finished Sixth Rowat came back to
a third place finish in the 200 butters
fly While Mark Williams, who was
{orced to miss Friday's action, took
a sixth alter a long bus trip to the
meet that morning.

Ward piled up some more Grinneil
points finishing third in the 100 free
despite drawing the highly iiii»
favorable outside lane. Carns took an
eighth. Daley chalked up a third in
the 200 breast, after a bad start with
Eeye taking tenth.

Divers Pete Bernstein and Larry
Huntoon took second and third places
respectively with Huntoon pulling off
probably the best dive 0f the meet to
move up from iiith place.

The 400 freestyle relay capped off
an already discouraging day when
Grinnell's entry was disqualified on
a questionable ruling that we failed
to touch the wall on one turn,

in sum it was a disheartening loss.
Grinnell could have won but for those
little things which kept piling up and
eventually spelled defeat.
