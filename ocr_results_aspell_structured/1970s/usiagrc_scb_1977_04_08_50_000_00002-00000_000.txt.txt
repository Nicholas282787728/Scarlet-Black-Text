found for offices

The office of Development, the Treasurer's Office. and the Office
of College Relations, all of which were housed in the downtown
Office Building but had to relocate when the college sold the
building to G.’I‘.E. Data Services earlier this year, are to be per-
manently located in a college-owned house at 11035 Park St.

The house, a duplex, is currently used to house faculty. it will
undergo extensive renovation in order to accomodate the three
offices. The cost of the renovation, according to Director of the
Physical Plant Dale Hawn, “could run as high as $100,000.” The
money allocated for the renovation will come out oi the funds
received from the sale of the downtown building.

The Service Bureau, which was also housed in the downtown
Office Building, has been permanently located in the BM} Service
Building on Tenth Ave. The other ﬂiree offices, however, will be in
temporary quarters until the renovation of the house is completed.

The house presently houses two members of the faculty and their
families. Hawn estimates that the renovations will be completed
approximately six months after the house is vacated, The college IS
now attempting to find other housing for these families so
renovation can begin as soon as possible.

Hawn's office is drawing up plans for the renovation ”to meet the
space needs of the individual offices," The actual renovation will be
undertaken by both Brio personnel and a private contracting firm.

Phi Beta Kappas anrfounced

by John Strauss

Twenty six seniors and five
juniors from Grinnell have been
admitted to the prestigious
organization of Phi Beta Kappa
this year. Elected last month,
these students were officially
recognized last night in a formal
awards ceremony,

The list of seniors elected in-
cludes Laurie August, Matthew C.
Brennan, Susan M. Dujack,
Suzanne Farver, Daniel P.
Finkelman, Neal W. Fleming,
Carol A. Godschall, Celia I.
Goldwag, Devon B. Griffith,
Estelle S. Gross, Donald F.
Heiman and Tracy L. Huling.

History

Continued from p. l

termed the “national security
mentality" oi the history faculty
throughout the selection process.
He felt that the disagreements that
have arisen were a “question of
lack of communication, and it was
not our fault."

Robert Taylor, a senior who has
studied in Hong Kong and has
specialized in Far Eastern studies
at Grinnell, felt that he was as well
qualified to judge the competency
of a candidate as the professors on
the history faculty.

Richard Peterson was also
dissatisfied with the relationship
between the EPC and the history
faculty. He voiced some com-
plaints that were fairly common
among the EPC members, “Some
faculty appreciated our time and
effort~but did they value our
opinion?” It was his impression
that “some faculty members had
preconceived notions."

Kintner denies this last charge,
and said the members of the EPC
could be accused of the same thing,
since they had obviously discussed
the candidates among themselves
before they talked to the faculty
about them.

As a result of the Climate of
dissatisfaction on the part of both
the faculty and the EPC, cir-
cumstances developed which made
the hiring of a permanent in
structor impossible [or next year.
For an interim term of one year,
Professor Nakahara of Waseda
University in Japan was hired as
Yang's replacement, Waseda
participates with the Associated
Colleges of the Midwest in their
East Asian exchange program.

There is general agreement that
the EPC Should have an important
role in evaluating the quality of a
potential candidate’s teaching
style. Professor of English and

American Studies Charles Cleaver
made the analogy that, “the

cobbler makes the shoe, but the
wearer has to tell where it pin-

Other seniors chosen are Karen
A. Kahn, Neal A. Klegerman, Lei
Ann Marshall, Claudia J. Morgan,
Polly Morrice, Teresa A. Perrin,
Richard N. Peterson, Janice K.
Sharp, Marjorie C. Skotheim,
Frank S. Smith, Sam Tanenhaus,
Robert P. Taylor, Clarice Wilson
and Dale Worley.

The five juniors chosen as Phi
Beta Kappa are Susan E. Duffey,
Keith R, Harmon, Darren L
Hoover, Donald L, Renfrew and
Ben J. Spiegel.

To be chosen as Phi Beta Kappa,
seniors must complete four
semesters in residence at Grinnell
and be in the top 20 per cent of their

ﬂ

class. Juniors must complete five
semesters and be in the top a per
cent of their class. These lists of
students are then cut down by 3Q».
executive committee and Chapter
members. Eventually major ade
Visors are contacted and omer
activities are accounted for.

Harvev Brooks, Pierce
professor of technology and public
policy at Harvard University,
addressed the new members at the
awards ceremony. His topic was
“The Expert and the Politician."
Brooks is one of the country’s top
experts on technology and public

policy. §

 

 

ches."

There is also general agreement,
however, that the role of EPC’s
remains too vague and ill defined.
“The whole EPC structure ought to
be more uniform across the
college,” according to Professor of
History and American Studies
Alan Jones. He decries the
amorphous quality of the
relationship between the faculty
and EPC in the Various departs
ments of the college. “Department
variation on role. voting power and
access to material creates in-
vldious comparison.”

As an example of possible in
vidious comparison, the art EPC,
as opposed to the history EPC. has
one vote as a group in the final
recommendation decision. In the
philosophy department, both the
EPC and faculty have the power to
veto the other group’s preferred
candidate. Yet another variation
exists in the hiring procedure of the
political science department. In
this case the EPC has access to
personal letters oi recom-
mendation, if the individual
candidate so agrees.

Dean Waldo Walker explained
that it is college policy not to allow
students to read letters of
recommendation due to their
confidential nature He said that he

 

is not aware of any legal reason
that prevents students from .
reading the letters. \§

The entire situation has led to
varying degrees of disillusionment
among the members of the history
EPC. On one extreme, Straus has
suggested, as a possibility, that in
the future the EPC Withdraw from
the hiring procedure entirely,
Peterson, though admitting to
disillusionment and disap-
pointment, would not advocate any
type of radical action such as the
total dishanding of the history
EPC,

The administration
acknowledges that there ar
serious problems with the campu
EPC system. Initial efforts have
been made toward a solution of this
dilemma. Dean of the College
Waldo Walker said, “I have been
working on making more uniform‘
the utilization and application of
the EPCS.”

Unfortunately, any future
solution will come too late for the
history department's present
predicament, Any future attempts
at hiring for this position may
suffer from the repercussions of
this year‘s events. As Guroff said,
“The difficulty of filling the
position next year will be shrouded
by the circumstances of this year." '
