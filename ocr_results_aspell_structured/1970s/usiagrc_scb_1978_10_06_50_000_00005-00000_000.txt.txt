Military inv

On October 10, recruiters for the
United States Marine Corps will
appear on the Grinnell campus; in
coincidence with this event, a
group of students has organized a
Set of informal activities aimed at
raising the consciousness of the
campus community regarding the
philosophy oi the military and the
dangers of militarism in general.

We do not question the right oi
these recruiters to be on campus;
any individual or group has the
right to come and make their
position known. However, by the
same token, we have the right and,
we feel, the responsibility to
present an alternative viewpoint.

OUR ALTERNATIVE is based
on three premises: 1) military
service dehumanlzes those who
participate in it; 2) our cultures

current emphasis on the military
has significant harmful effects on
society; and 37 there are peaceful,
more constructive alternative
modes oi service to one’s country
and mankind available.

Military “Service" dehumanizes
everyone involved When a recruit
reports for military training, he is
stripped of all sense of individual
identityihis head is shaved and all
personal possessions are taken
from himr In the Words of
sociologist Erving Goffman
(Asylums. p. 16), “Admission
procedures might better be called
‘trimming' or ‘programming’
because in thus being squared
away the new arrival allows
himseli to be shaped and coded into
an object that can be fed into the
administrative machinery of the
establishment."

IN FACT, HE IS no longer an
individual at all; he becomes a cog
in the military machine, This
dehumanization goes as tar as to
include physical abuse of the
recruit; there have been numerous
cases in recent years of abuse,
even killing. of recruits during
basic training.

Once the recruit becomes a cog
in the machine, he is indoctrinated
to military values, a set of Values

most oi society. The recruit is
taught the “positive” values of
mindless obedience to authority. of
unthinking jingoistic nationalism,
of hatred of the “enemy,” and of
Wanton killing and destruction. In
general, the recruit is ingrained
with a complete lack of respect for
the individual and for life.

THE MILITARY IIAS at least
two significant negative effects on
society. First, it takes resources
away irom societal problems
which demand attention. Between
1946 and 1975. the United States
spent $1500 billion on defense; this
figure exceeds the value of) all
commercial and residential
buildings in the United States. In
1974 the United States expanded
over nine million man-hours of
labor on defense. tSeymor
Melman, The Permanent War
Economy.)

These figures represent
tremendous losses of resources
which potentially could have been
devoted to public transit. alter-
native energy sources. rebuilding
oi cities, providing fuller em-
ployment, or any number of

constructive outlets.
SINCE WORLD WAR II, the

United States has devoted ap-
proximately 30 per cent of its
research and development to
military research. as compared
with, ior example, Japan or West
Germany, who devote well over 80
per cent to civilian research. Is it
any wonder that Japanese and
German consumer products are
significantly outselling their
American competition, given that
our research and development has
gone into military technology, with
no assurance of return for the
civilian sector?

Second, the military imposes
extremely disproportionate burr
dens on minorities and the
disadvantaged, Recruits for the
military come largely from the 17
per cent of American youth who
are unemployed (the figure for
black youth is 34 per cent). Blacks
constitute 26 per cent of all
military recruits, compared with a
6.3 per cent figure for officers. One
imilication of this is that in the

direction Lad-steam

event of a war it will be the poor
and minorities who are sent to the
front lines and who Will be the first
to die. America asks the op
pressed, who have the smallest
real stake in society, to sacrifice
the most in order to preserve that
society.

IF ONE WISHES to serve his
country, military “service” is not
the only, nor the best, service
available. There are peaceful,
more constructive alternatives
available such as the Peace Corps
and VISTA just to name two,

These alternatives can certainly
be considered service, in that the
individual is giving of him or
herself for the general good of
society and mankind. These
alternatives are engaged in con.
structive work, improving life for
those being served.

IN ADDITION. THESE alter-
natives actually increase our
security ior check Soviet ex
pansion, it you prefer) by in
creasing our credibility in the
developing world. The primary
lesson to be learned from Viet Nam
is that we cannot win purely
military victories in Third World
countries; we cannot win victories
in developing countries without the
support and trust oi their
populations. We cannot win their
trust through threats and coercion;
we can only do so through sincere
efforts to improve their socio-
economic situations and by
committing ourselves to human
needs over the military establish
ment at home.

American society has paid a
great price ior its military
establishment. It has dehumanized
both those involved and its entire
culture, it has inﬂicted serious
negative consequences on the
entire society, and we have
neglected viable alternatives. thus
alienating possible allies in the
developing world. How long must
we continue to pay this price?

For a.iuller presentation oi this
issue I urge you to attend the ac
tivities on the evening oi October 9
and all day on October 10,

and it wiped out several spectators
who were busy watching the show.
I made my escape, grabbing a
large piece of rind for a shield. and
my last view oi the room was or an
egg being lobbed in the direction of
the g-stringed periormer, I never
found out Whether it hit her, I’d like
to think it did.

There, and who says the Grinnell
Experience isn’t an exciting, ever
broadening part of today’s world?
Not me, that's for sure.

Now that we ve finished with
entertainment. let's talk about
food. There’s a line from a song
entitled “She's My Girl” by Tom
Lehrel‘, one of the all-time greatest
‘malevocalists, which goes, “ . .ior
breakfast she makes coffee that
tastes like shampoo; I come home
ior dinner and get peanut butter
stew. , Sounds pretty far-
fetched, huh? You wouldn't eat it,
would you?

SURPRISE! I was in a Soup
mood one evening at beautitui
‘ Cowles. and i picked up a bowl of
What looked like clam chowder
mixed with mud. Although bent on
eating soup no matter how off
white it was, just out of curiosity I
threw a “what is it'l” over my
shoulder as I continued down the
cafeteria line. “Peanut butter
soup," came the cheeriul reply, I
told myself it was a joke and sat
down to eat. ‘

Well, it was no joke. There was
definitely peanut butter in there,
and it wasn't even Skippy. I won't
even attempt to spell the sound my
mouth made when it tasted that
foul concoction. I still have
nightmares about George
‘ Washington Carver. Peanut butter
‘soup? Come on. McConnell. 1'11
‘ make you a deal: you leave the
peanut butter in the sandwiches
l where it belongs, and I won‘t ask
‘ you about your salary.

Here are some things to say to
people you've just met, ii you want
them to have a really had first
impression oi you and think you're
dreadful) These little bits of ice
breaking conversation rank right
up there with “Hot enough inr
you?" and ”What’s your favorite
kind of linoleum?”

1. What's your maior?

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2. What’s your tutorial?

3. Why did you come to Grinneili

t, where are you from?

5. Don‘t study too hard, now!

6. What hall do you live in'l

7. Who's your adviser?

8 Don’t you think Turner looked
better with a beard?

THERE‘S SOMETHING about
parties that has me puzzled. Often
times there is a stereo cranked up
so high that you can’t even hear
yourself scream, which forces you
to say “What?" to a lot oi people
who take that to mean you have
nothing worthwhile to talk about
and walk away.

Now don't get me wrong, I'm no

Choice, It's just that I feel this
strange need to hear what people
are saying to me, and if I can‘t and
they can‘t hear me, I feel like
maybe I haven't communicated.
Perhaps I'm just screwed up.

OII, WELL. ONE solution to this
problem would be to have more

that was the best weekend so far
