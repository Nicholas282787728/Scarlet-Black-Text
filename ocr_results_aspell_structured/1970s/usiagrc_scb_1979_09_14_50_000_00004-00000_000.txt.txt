Math lab mirthful

by Matthew Reomes

Almost a year after it was initiated,
the Math Lab, alias the “Mirth" Lab,
has found its place at Grinnell. It was
re-christened the “Mirth" Lab by
students, director Mark Jones explainr
ed, because of the sense of humor he
interjects while aiding students with
their math difficulties.

Early last November, Jones opened
the lab based on the idea of
mathematics professor Gene Herman,
who saw the need {or assistance in
classes involving mathematical
calculation.

Arnold Adelberg, chairman of the
mathematics department, said that
“the ﬁrst line of defense” for a stu-
dent experiencing problems should be
to see his own protessor.

In explaining his role as director,
Jones said. “I’m here to help anyone
with mathematics . . . when studying,
it’s sometimes good to have someone
to talk to." He added, “l‘d like people
to know the lab is a place to work. I'm
really trying to encourage people to
come and work so they can ask ques-
tions as they solve the problems,”

The usefulness of the Math Lab was
illustrated by Adelberg: ”A student
in a Calculus course finds out his
backgound in trigonometry is not good
wough. He can then go to the Math
Lab to get filled in.” Jones agreed,
saying, ”I can otter help on a onertor
one basis; I can attend to special
parts oi any section with which
students may need help” but pro
iessors cannot take the time to cover
in detail.

The Math Lab has an offical place in
the math department, being included
in the department's budget. Adelberg
and Jones did point out, huwevcr, that
an informal relationship exists bet-
ween the lab and the science laculty
as well.

Through the problems brought up at
the lab, it is possible for protessors to
find out which, it any, are special pro-

blems that may require lurther ex-
planation in their classes.

The best way to utilize the lab, ac-
cording to Jones, is to bring in a
speciiic problem. Using that as a star
ling point, he can judge the “severity
of the case."

The Math Lab is currently open
from 9:30 to 3:30. Monday through
Friday. Jones is in the process oi
working out a new schedule including
student assistants, which should

study programs because “there are a
lot of rip-oils out there.“

AS director, Caulkins’ oliice hours
will be Tuesday through Friday after-
noons on the first ﬂoor of Nullen
House.

According to Walker, Koestcr’s
other duties will be “farmed out” to
other administrative personnel and
faculty. Walker will handle internship
and independent study applications,
and Maxine Paul, registrar, will mke
over Koester's position on the Come

enable the lab to stay open on nights
and weekends,

A new program, math concepts, was
initiated this fall.

September 476 Jones ran mree one
hour classes, covering basic math con»
cepts, trigonometry and algebra, and
calculus.

As long as students continue to show
interest, Jones said, “it's a beginning
of the semester activity which I‘ll be
trying to continue.“
