Neil Young‘Fur From through’

by Ron Medvin

There seems to be one particular
game that music critics play time
and time again When a periormer
first begins to be successful, they
lavish much praise on his music. But
alter he has proved himself, the cri»
tics seem to make a poliit oi trying
to destroy him Take Neil Young.
He was labeled a sure superstar a
iew years ago, and now critics seem
to be rushing to point out how bad
his latest album is.

Well, I am not a music critic--
I have never pretended to be. (I
give my opinions, but I expect pew
pie to make up their own minds in
the end) So i can say that Harvest
is a very good album. It is not as
great as After the Goldrush, which
became an instant classic. But it
certainly is not “boring or dull",
to use some other critics’ words.
The album as a whole takes and
Country sound; it's a lot softer
and simpler than his previous music.
The first cut, “Out On the Weekend"
is the pericct example ofthis change
Neil Young is still there, as is his
distinct harmonica, but this song is
quiet, lacking any iorm oi rock, The
same is true for the title ctlt "Hare
vest”, which is nnlorlunately the
worst Cut of the album. This is
because oi Young's voice, which
lacks the feeling present in the other
songs. It is a very repetitious song

.,...ll:ttil

are nice, Young's lack oi emotion
does them an injustice.

“A Man Needs a Maid” once again
proves that an orchestra~(London
Symphony)~can enhance a song.
This song is astonishingly beantiiul,
but quite niystilying lyrically. It
may lend a clue to the relationship
oi Young with Carrie Snodgrass: “l
was watching a movie with a lriend/
I fell in love with the actress/She
was playing a part l could under-
stander/A maid,,A man needs a
maid.” But what's all this about a
“maid"’?!'7 The orchestra does get
carried away at times, especially
when one hears loud Chimes that
creep out oi the background,

“Heart of Gold" you no doubt have
heard enough by now, it's a pleasant
song that fits in with the rest of the
album, and harmony by James Tay-
lor and Linda Ronstadt is welcomed,

“Are You Ready [or the Country” is
musically a lot of fun It has a per-
sistent “oompah” beat, and some
excellent harmony by Dave Crosby
and Steve Stills. (Nash is also on
this album, but they never appear
as CSNXtY.) There’s some fine guir
tar work that has an unmistakable
George Harrison whine to it, Speak-
ing oi the music, the back-up band,
the Stray Gators, is excellent
throughout the album

One oi the :tlbum's best songs is
"Old Man”. It's another Country
number, and Neil Young's singing is
at his very best. Once again, Taylor
and Ronstadt provide the extra Von
cnls and there is more of the Hare
rison guitar sound, not to mention a
gently added banio, Once again,
Young speaks oi his need tor love.
“I need someone to love me the whole

day through/All, one look in my eyes
and you tell me that’s true.”

“There's a World" is another song
with the London Symphony and it’s
a good song gone bad, The reason
is severe ovel‘production--(some-
times known as “Phil Spector syn-
drome”), The beginning sounds like
the opening of the Christmas show
at Radio City in New York, ,

Another partial failure is “Alas
bama". Alone, it could be a drar
matic song. but one can't help com
paring it to “Southern Man" and then
there is no comparison. This song
lacks the drive and power which
characterized “Southern Man",
Even the subject of the song is
similar: “What are you doing
Alabama7/You got the rest of the
union to help you along/ What's
going wrong?”

“The Needle and the Damage Done"
is another antirheroin song, in Case
we’re still too stupid to get the mes
sage. ”l've seen the needle and the
damage done/A little part of it in
everyone /But every junkie’s like a
setting sun,” It’s done live, but you
can’t tell 'till you hear the clapping,
The vocal is clear and bright. Un-
fortunately, the song as a whole
lacks a definite melody, but Young’s
treatment oi each line makes up
for the overall weakness.

The album closes with “Words/
(Between the Lines oi Age)”
There’s not much to say about this
song that hasn't been said about
other good songs on the album,
Young’s vocal comes through again,
this time with help from friends
Stills and Nash. The song is long,
maybe too long, and his lyrics are
more complicated and vague than
usual. I’ll let you make up your own
minds about this one. (See! What
music critic would do that?)

Just to say it again don't be
tooled by those proiessional men.
Take it from a friend. Harvest is
a good album, in fact it's one of the
better albums I’ve heard in awhile.
it may not be another classic, but
Neil Young is iar irom through.

Madam DeLecltlse, who became
well known among new laces in Grinr
nell College during the iolk dance
concert Friday and Saturday night,
is the former French instructor in

to make her Classes lively and tried
to give the "feel of the country
(France)” as Well as basic instruce
tion in the language. "I would tell
my students stories about my fame
ily and my experiences "

The Grinnell French teacher-also
witnessed the return of several
oi her students as young profes-
sors, including Al Jones (History)
and Richard Cervene (Art)

Alter her retirement Madam De
Lecluse busied herself witli so many
diilerent activities that She did not
experience the empty ieeliug ol re-

cooking lessons, does her own gar-

Grinneil has friends in high places.

Although the “Playboy" case was
lost on technical grounds (did they

declaring that a student Wearing

Lecluse's appreciative attitude to-
ward the Educational system at that
country She is rather critical oi
the American ”hour, credit” sys-
tern. “in France you don't get
credits like Gold Bond stamps in
the store," she said,

when asked about her opinion oi
the abolishment oi requirements
in College, she expressed her
sorrow and said' "(or a liberal
arts education they should have
certain basic courses . . and a
person's education is not wellv
balanced ivithout them.”

Madam De Lecluse's classroom
rules were unique throughout the
campus She would not allow smok-
ing and bare feet in her classes,
"I don't want to see your dirty
soles aiid dirty test in class,” she
would tell the students.

Her appearance in the folk dance
concert on Friday and Saturday
night was the highlight oi the pro
gram Madam De Leclnse started
the iaculty dance iour years ago and
she seems to enjoy working with
the group. '

When asked about lter feeling t0~
wards fine arts she said, “Classi—
cal music is my liie; unfortunately
i don't play any instruments." with
all the affection toward music Ma-
dam De Lecluse dislikes modern
music to the point that she asked
Eric Jensen not to get oiiended it
she does not attend his concerts!

Madam De Lecluse is ’72 years
