Diary of a Faggot

mysell. But Why?

When i was eleven. I was supposed
to shower with the other guys in gym.
This was impossible because I would
become aroused and suffer the
familiar I'tdlcul87lagg0i, The coach
used to embarrass me by telling the
class I refused to shower wilh them

And where could I go tor help? who
could 1 tell about my problem? who
would understand? ,lx'o one, No one
wanted anything to do with a queer

when I was tout-teen, Irememher
looking up homosexuality in the
library's card catalogue There was
one book. It defined homosexuality as
a Sexual attraction Irlr the same sex,
It said that homosexuals were
misogynists

It stud that homosexuals were sick
and needed to be cured. l thought that
t was a homosexual, out. according to
tile book, homosexual feelings were
“normal" during adolescent years.
Maybe it was "only a phase “ I need»
ed someone to talk wilh and there was
no one there, i heard “lem, faggot,
queer, sissy," and it was so diiticiilt to
reach out when no one liked me.
wanted to talk with me_ have anything
to do \Hlil me.

said something about this locked-away -
secret and even my parents rejected
me. .
Although they said that they loved
me, I was warned not [0 mention ”it".
to anyone else: “It would disgrace the
tainilyl” I agreed to see a
psychologist, to change, to be “cured"
to make people proud of me and love
me

I met With Nancy, my psychologist,‘
over and over heiore I realized that
she knew nothing more than i did, But
She was convinced that I was “sick" ’
and needed to be “cured.”

Ididll'l “ant to he a faggot, so I
resorted to more drastic ideas, Isug-
gestcd shock therapy. l had read an
article about people receiving elecr
ii‘iCill shocks when they would respond
favorably to homosexual stimuli.
Maybe this would work tor me, but I
was too scared

My dad suggested going to a pro
