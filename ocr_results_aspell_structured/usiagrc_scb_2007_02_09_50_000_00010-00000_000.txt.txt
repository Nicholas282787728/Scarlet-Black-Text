Grinnelligentsia (or the absence thereof)

Colleges. as hotbeds of intellectual

late. In order
to do this, we need to actively partici-
pate in the mental life of both campus
and beyond.We also need to be willing
to challenge old knowledge where necr
essnry and to introduce new directions
for intellectual Engagement.
Unfortunately, we students are not
doing nearly enough to supplement
nnd nctively direct Grinnell’s growrh as
an intellectual community. This is prit
mnrily because, on the whole, we often
fail to consider ourselves as more than
passive members ofrhc community. We
look to professors and gmest speakers to
tell us how to think and what to think
about. On the one hand, this makes
sense: professors have read more and
tend to know more. They have a let to

offer us in terms ofour own intellectual
development. However, this is not high
school. it is no longer enough to make
do with spoon-fed knowledge: we must

be active and

critical learn-

ets.
The life
of a Grinncll
student is
fairly dc-
manding: we
need to be
on top of our classes and extracurricular
activities while maintaining some SCIYIT
blance ofa social life as well as ﬁnancial
and emotional stability. Thus we are,
understandably enough, weary of any—
thing related to school by the end ofthe
day. We reach a point that we can barely
wait for classes to finish not so that we
can get back to our readings and other
intellectual activities, but so that we can
eat, drink and be merry (leaving glib
pseudorintcllectual discourse for a plan
B). Our lives increasingly suffer from
intellectual poverty and we are too busy
to even notice. Almost every weekend,
we go to Harris or High Street parties
and get trashed. Inebiiation may have
its time and p1acc,yct in my opinion,

engaging in drunken mindless activi-
ties like grinding and playing beer pong
surely has no place in any intellectual
community

When we take a break from the
intellectual task of critical thinking,
we relinquish our ability to make “1’
formed decisions. Many of us become
uncritical thinkers on weekends and
weeknighrs and anytime we are not
in class. Slowly, we become uncritical
thinkers even while in class. After all,
as the great saying 7 which applies to
oui minds as well as to a host of other
things — goes: If you don’t use it, you
lose it.Thcre is no sphere of life that is
closed to critical thinking. Even while
engaging in grinding or beer pong,
there is no reason we cannot simulta-
neously engage in thinking. There is
always food for thought. We can mull
over the power dynamics involved in
post-Harris hook-ups or the chemical
processes involved in making popcorn.
Critical thinking points out the choices
we have in any given situation and thus
leads to informed decisions and the
happy endings that ineVitably follow.

We must not think of intellectuals
ism as privileging pure mental activity
over physical activity. The Cartesian

Februay 9 2007

mmdrbody split has led to the idea that
we cultivate the one at the exclusion of
the other. That might explain why some
of us have trouble imagining athletes as
brilliant students. ‘Iftlicy aie spending
all that time on their bodics,..,’ so the
argument goes. Utter rubbish, as rhc
empirical fact that some of our best
students are also good and dedicated
athletes goes to show. There is no rear
son we should not be both intellectut
ally and physically active. There is ev-
ery reason to be both. Similarly, critical
thinking requires notjust that wc think
critically, but also that we then engage
the world on the basis of that thinking.
Intellectualism at its best is never hypot
critical and always in earnest.

In a world iun by a populist antitint
tellcctualism (of the variety that elected
the current president ofrhis fine coun-
try). we must take seriously the task to
seek, ifnot truth,at lcasl’undcrsranding.
We must strive to make connections
between seemingly disparate events,
to see possibilities within actualities
and realities behind illusions. Active
learning and critical thinking are our
foremost responsibilities as students, as
citizens and as members of our come
munity.

Is the Swedish welfare state exportable?

In the 2/3/07 issue ofThe Economist, President
Bush was quoted ns praising the US economy’s un~
expected 3.5 percent growth output ‘in the fourth
quarter of 2006. Bush commented on the realities of
income inequality, noting that education and skilled
workers are the key componcnrs for dealing with it.

But the budget that President Bush most recently
proposed features cuts in Medicare and Medicaid,
giving less money to states to cover children in famir
lies at twice the poverty level or more and maintaining
an eight pcrccnt cut in Medicare payments to doctors.
Additionally, domcstic ngencics such as schools nnd
local governments will only see a one percent annual
increase in their budgets, Comparatively. the Penta-
gon will receive an 11 percent increase in its operating
budget (Associated Press, 2/3/07).

It is more than cleai that Bush’s proposed 2007
budget does not align with his aforementioned state
ments on' the importance of education and income
inequalities. .

Now try explaining this discrepancy to a Swede,
Nordic pragmatism has taken the form of the so,
cial-wcifare state in Sweden since the 1930s, provid
ing individuals with protection from their families.
This protection entails access to excellent schooling,
healthcare, and government assistance from “Krybbe
to Grav," meaning a Swede is not constrained as much
by the socio—economic clnss ofthe family into which
he or she is born.

away from hefty financial aid packages for interna
tional students. In Sweden, education is free from
dayrcarc all the way through higher education. Frida’s
apartment is paid for partly by government subsidy
and partly by government loans. She teaches spin-
ning classes in exchange for free gym membership
(yes, 1 was given a tall, leggy, beautiful Swedish room
mate, although she isn’t blonde) because she doesn't
have much to worry about other than getting an edut
cation. Every citizen of swc-
den enjoys this privilege.

Ofcourse, nothing in life
is free, but those taxes that
seem astronomical to Alnen’

Fiscally, Sweden has committed to run budget sur»

Support for the social-welfare state has persistv

The social-welfare state faces pressure from unt
employment and shifting demographics. one np~
proach to unemployment proposed by the New
Moderates features cutting unemployment benefits
from 80 percent to 65 percent compensation. The
idea is to encourage people to seek new jobs and disc
courage “free riders." one obstacle to employment is
that it is somewhat risky to hire anyone 7 employees
are tenured fairly quickly and an unofficial minimum
wage is enforced by the
labor unions that hold
significant political
clout (The Economist
9/9/06).

The welfare state
will also be tested in
coming years by the ag—
ing baby—boomer generation, A shrinking employee
base will not be able to afford the costs of care for
increasing numbers of retirees. Nordic pragmatism
will prevail in this situation and l have no doubt their
social engineering prowess will tackle rhc issue.

It is hard to make a direct comparison between
American and Swedish policy because of the sheer
size ofAmerica’s population. Sweden has the same
number of citizens as people living in the greater New
York metro area.

As of now, it looks like the Swedish model does ‘

not see a bright future in the United States but there
are certainly tenets of Swedish policy from which the
