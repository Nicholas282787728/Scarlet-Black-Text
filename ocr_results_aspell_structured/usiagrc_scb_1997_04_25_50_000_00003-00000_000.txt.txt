When store clerks follow you around: body piercing. at Grinnell

BY KEVIN MCGOLDRICK
Staff Writer

“Ye shall not make any cuttings in
your ﬂesh for the dead, nor print any
marks upon you: I am the Lord,"
reads Leviticus 19:28 in the Bible
Many people of Christian back-
ground have used this passage to at-
tack the adornment of the human
body. yet this rarely stops the grow»
ing number of people who continue
to pierce their body at an increasing
rate. In an article on the World Wide
Web, “Overview
of Body Pierc-
ing", a piercing
enthusiast ex—

“much of the re

tions to bring
spirituality and
meaning to the
frenzy of modern
urban life,"

Piercing is not
just an art or
hobby, but has
become an indus-
try which has now taken the contemr
porary ritual of making money to a
new plane. For instance, recently the
Association of Professional Piercers
developed a set of limited edition
phone cards which can be “recharged
at 33 cents per rrlinute, of which 20%
will continue to beneﬁt the APP."

In addition to its capitalistic nature,

LheAPP and the piercing industry has
attempting to establish itself as a pmr
fesslonal occupation. They now have
Open Meetings to “convene for sev-
eral days ofscrlous discussion about

ultimately the right ”to the peace of
mind which comes from knowmg
that their piercer knows and practices
the very highest standards of slcrll-
izatlon and hygiene."

Despite these attempts to normnlr

izc and regulate the plcrcing iitdusr
try, picrcccs still enjoy a certain
S|Igm£l inAittei-icau sucicly. “People
fear you," Chris Bidlcr ‘98 explained
with n conniving, wide eyed grin As
he lapped up thc smilc, senior An-
thony Cammztrala described how for
him II is “entertaining to watch other
people look at other people " In this
case he is the Object ofothcr pcoplc‘s

body.

He said, “I
wanted to get
one sincc ﬁfth

mom said I had
to wait until I
was eighteen or
I left home."
Then he left
home for an in-
lcrnship with
the Secretary of
State of Illinois
and a weckcnd
aflcr Easlcr he
got his first
plClcing, His
second piercing
he got while he
was as, he de
scribed, "tripping iny nss off," at lhe
LullapaloozaMusic Festival. Then at
tho end of his freshman year he got a
nose piercing followed by a nipple
ring the following January. Asked
how he could possibly remember the
where and when of it all, Bidler
chimed in “Il's pretty hard to forget."
Cdlllmill’ala sees his piercings as not

only 1| “conscious decision to look
different," but as mile markers in his
life. However, they were not only
“souvenirs" but some served as life
style changing experiences for him.
His 14 gauge (refers to width) tongue
ring he got when he was a sophomore
meant he had to an extent ”re»teach
himself to speak" but he added that
“I also quit smoking because I had
something else to do with my
tongue " While piercings are not ac-
ccptable in many oflhe work places
Caman’ata has worked at he has man-
aged to maintain his piercings,

One of Cammarata‘s piercings
winch often makes people who are
slmilarlyendowed cringe is hisscro—
tum ring, According to BME (The
Body Modiﬁcation E—Zine), cock
rings can be entirely safe if rubber
or leather rings are used. However,
some danger comes into play with
the use of metal rings. According to
BME, “Metal
rings can bc haz-
ardous; if you
put too small of
one on your non-
erect cock, your
cock may be»
come so erect
that you can no
longer remove it
7 and if it is too
tight, it will pre-
vent your cock
from softening.
This may in-
volve a trip to’ the emergency room
and the use of bolt cutters No joke."
According to BME, rings on female
genitalia lend to be much safer with
tearing still being a danger. Ultir
mately for both men and women
cock rillgs can add an extra degree
of pleasure to life. An anonymous
sophomore who has a Prince Albert

“Ye shall

— Leviticus 19:28

said that he enjoyed his piercing be-
cause it provides him with a good
pickup line, but added, “Piercing can
enhance a woman’s experience but
not really mine."

While there al-
ways is a danger
to piercings,
Cammarata ex-
plained that the
only bad thing
about his
piercings are in
the “middle of winter when there’s
major metal in your head it hurts.“
But despite that he said, “I have no
plans of taking any out right now,"
and he insmuates that some of the
rings will become a life long com-
mitment, Ultimately, his love of
piercings come down to the fact that
when he saw them on other people,
as he said, “I ﬁgured I could be
down.”

Another ﬁrst
year student
who will remain
anonymous and
who had numerr
ous earrings
said, “I would
never get a
piercing on any
other part of my
body." However,
she has been exe
cited about the
large number of
complements
she has gotten on the caning she has
now. She described a situation in
which one day she walked into the
Health Center because she had a
runny nose and soar throat. Then as
the nurse proceeded to look down her
throat she screamed “Oh my good
ncss!”. The first year continues, “And
I was thinking there was pus or

something and then I she says, No]
love your earrings! Where did you
get them?” There is a ﬁne line be-
tween these compliments and the
Biblical attitude
that adornmenls
are crude and
self defacing.

While people
who get their
bodies pierced
have different
views on the act
of piercing itself most seem to agree
about the best place to get pierced.
Arbuckle's in Cedar Rapids seems to
be the favorite place among piercers
at Glinnell. As Bidler said, "Don't
vouch for any place else," People
must be careful when going for
piercings as there are many shady
piercing places across the state of
Iowa. The APP has issued guidelines
for piercing shops, The following list
show some of their guidelines:

(1) Ear piercing guns are not
adequately sterilizable and should
not be used. .

(2) All needles should be
preste 'lized and disposed of after
one sitting.

(3)A new pair of latex gloves
should be used for every procedure,

(4) The room used for
piercings should be kept clean and
disinfected frequently.

(5) Should only use appropri-
atejewelry in piercings. Appropriate
jewelry is made of high quality stain-
less steel, solid 14 k or, 18 k gold,
niobium, titanium, platinum or a
dense, low porosity plastic,

In addition to these it is imponant
that the plercer provide information
about disinfecting and cleansing the
piercing after the work has been
done, in order to prevent infection.

 

Tattoos:

BY LINDSEY HAGY
Staff Writer

Everyone from Dennis Rodman to
Pat Boone (though his are fake) are
now sporting tattoos , needless to say,
Grinnell students haven’t allowed
themselves to be left out of what the
Des Maine Register has cited on it’s
list of What’s Hot for 1997. Many
Grinnellians can be seen with perma
nent pictures on their ankles, arms,
chest, and other various body parts,

Puncture tattooing has been dated
back as early as 8000 BC and is still
very popular. As Claire Rambo ‘98,
who has a tattoo of a ﬂower on her
ankle, says, ”I think tattoos and pierc-
ing go through stages. A long time
ago they were beautiful and a sign
of strength, but then we became
“civilized" and they were equated

with primitive, savage people. But
now, we are going back to our roots,
we are getting in touch with the earth,
and so we are going back to tattoos
and piercing. So it is not just rebelr
lion against our parents' generation,
but it‘s a movement towards getting
in touch with ourselves and our past
and getting back to nature."

The motivations for and attitudes
towards these colorful body displays
vary greatly from person to person.
Rambo got her tattoo as a form of
liberation and to see if she could go
through with the pain. Darcy
Troutman ‘98, who has a tattoo of
two ﬂowers on her ankle, also sees
tattoos as means of proving oneself.
“...itjust seemed like such a not me
thing to do....I still kind of like it
when I see people from high school
and they say, ‘Wow, you’re the last
person 1 would have ever thought I’d
see with a tattoo} It makes me feel
like a rebel or something,“ she said
Similarly, sophomore Jenny Sawr
yers, with a tattoo of a gecko on her
lower back, says “It was more like
an impulse thing, a sense that that I
had the freedom to do what I wanted
to with my body.”

Others see tattoos as an art form or
a way to express themselves. Fresh»
man Daniel Lopez, who has the word
“unity" written in old English on his
upper left arm, says he had this tat-
too done “as a form of deep personal
expression...l knew that ifI was go
ing to get a tattoo, it had to be of
something that would remain impor
tant in my life. I knew that I would
always believe strongly in the need
for racial and cultural unity. Also, it

art, fashion, and rebellion

is kind ofa reference to the punk and
ska musical movement. “Unity" is a
song by a band called Operation lvy
who was one of the first bands to in-
tegrate Ski) and punk music as well
as theirideals ofa peaceful chstence
based on unconditional
acceptance..beautiful," Senior Emily
Ferrigno, who has alattoo ofa moon
and a spiral on her ankle, says ofhcr
tattoo, “For me it doesn’t really mean
anything too signiﬁcant, It's more of
an art form. I like tattoos that people
come up with themselves because il
means more.“

Ofcourse, there is the issue that tat-
toes are a trend, Ferrigno says, “I
deﬁnitely think it’s a fad, But who
the fuck cares? Get a tattoo if you
want one " Junior J,C. Cochran has
a tattoo on the left stde of his chest
which is “of the Chinese character

“In 99% ortltc cnscs I’d siiy people

would have to say I equate tattoos

because I thought it was trendy.”

 

 

Julie Roberts '97 recently had this dmgonﬂy tattooed on
her leg in Iowa City. Other designs that seem 10 be popular
with students arc/lowers and various slogans and logos.

Tattoos often end up having great
sentimental value. Sophomore Paul
Conn has ”ﬁve tattoos, my favo '
being a' s‘pc‘rin‘nround’r‘in'cg’gfwhich.
also looks like a suit, a tribal b‘a’n’dj"
and a black flag sign, I have 3 on
my legs, one on my shoulder, and
one on my hand. I really like them
because it kind of documents who
you have been at different periods of
time; what you believed in, what you
liked, etc, Even ifyour views change.
you can still look back and say ‘this
was me at one time?" Senior Rachale
Green, who has a ring of flowers
around her belly button and a tattoo
on her ankle which she designed her-
self, which is a combination of a
sprite, a woman, and a Unitarian Uni-
versallst symbol, says, “I think it
means a lot now becausel had it done
during my ﬁrst time to Costa Rica.
Also I am really close lo the woman
I had them done with now.”

These eight Grinnell students also
had different predictions for how
they would feel about their tattoos
once they got older. Troutman says
of her ankle tattoo, “I know
it's going to really suck when I go
for job interviews and if] get a job
where I have to dress nicely, it’ll look
sort of idiotic." Rambo feels very
differently about her tattoo, “In forty
years, it is going’to be so much part
of my body. Kind of like a nose or
and elbow. It is just going'to be there,
I think that I will still enjoy having ,
it, I will probably have ll retouched
in a few years It is me‘, it is not a
foreign hung on me, I thiltk iiothlng
ofit..." Cochran, ina way, combine:
these views by saying, “I can't forer
see the future, butI have agood idea ‘
that I won't give a rat's ass about it.
Since I'm not covered with tattoos I
won’t be grossed out. and even when
Ido get all saggy and wrinkly, I'll be
so nasty I‘ll ﬁgure, what does a llllle
more nastiness hurt. I‘m sure I won't
be out at the beach flashing my faded
tattoos at anyone, and even ifI do,
will Icare’l It’s an old man's prerogae
live not to give a fuck what the world
thinks, isn’t it?"

Concerning having the tattoo ap-
plied Fcrrigno said, “It hurt, but the
guy was pretty cute." Rambo agreed,
“It lturt like hell for the first few mine
utcs, but then it was the biggest high
I'd ever had ill my life. I think that’s
why lhey‘rc so addictive." Conn and
Cochran, who is planning to gct a
second lntloo this summer, agreed
that tattoos arc addlclivc,

 

A new brand of art

BY ERIN HUSTINGS
Features Editor

Next time your parents make a
snide remark 'aboul’yollr bbdy piercl
ing or iattoo;-or about the prevalence
of these body modiﬁcations among
the Grinnell student population, tell
them to be glad you and your friends
haven’t been branded. Branding, a
practice your parents probably only
associate with livestock. is quickly
becoming a popular alternative form
of body art.

Branding has been done to humans
for centuries. In nonAWestern cul-
tures, branding and scariﬁcation is
often used as a rite of passage. Euro-
peans branded their criminals with
marks such as an S on the cheek and
a fleur de lis on the shoulder. In more
recent history, many AfricanrAmeri-
can fraternities have had and con-
tinue the tradition of branding ini-
tiates with Greek letters. Notables
like Jesse Jackson and Emmitt Smith
of the Dallas Cowboys sport these
marks.

Human branding is a delicate op-
eration, due to the many curves and
few flat surfaces on bodies. Brand—
ing is accomplished with several
small irons. usually 1/16 to 1/32 of

an inch thick, cut to ﬁt the topogra-
phy of the body. The irons are bent
into the desired shapes and heated to
a temperature of around 1800 de-

around 2 seconds, the branding re-
sults in a third-degree burn, which,
according to experts. is preferable
because it destroys nerve endings and
hum less then minor burning, The
area branded will-never regain sen-
sitivity. but after scarring will usu-
ally have healed as much as possible
within approximately two months.
Third degree burns are known for
their propensity to infection, so carer
ful aftercare is vital to successful
branding. Brandees must cover their
markings with anti-bacterial oint—
ment and sterile dressing for the ﬁrst
forty»eight hours after the work has
been done. Brands must be kept
moist, and it is recommended that
multi-vitamins be taken until the
bmnd is healed. “ ‘
Although it may seem a bizarre
decoration, you can only pierce and
tattoo so much before the fascination
and available body space‘begin to
wane. Within a few years one might
well pass brave brandees in the log J '

 

gias of Grinnell.
