Bowen, U. of 1. Storm Center,
New Grinnell College Head

This was the headline in the Chicago Daily Tribune
of April 9. To quote choice passages: “During his three
yearsiBowen was a continual storm center. His adMinistra-
tion of the college created widespread faculty dissent and
resulted in charges that he had attempted to substitute
radical economic theories for those favoring free enterprise.

“Controversy over his work as Commerce dean broke

into the open after more than a year of secret bickering
in 1950( when Prof. Donald Kemmerer charged that Bowen
had forced Prof. Ralph H Blodgett out of the faculty. Blod-
gett had left to take a higher paying position at the U. of
Florida".
I It went on to say that Bowen was a champion of the
deficit spending theories of the late J. M. Keynes, and that
he, had ousted Blodgett because the latter was a free enter-
prise man.

After listing to the talk going around the campus it
seems that whatever the Tribune says against Bowen con-
vinces both student and faculty that Bowen will prove to
be one of the best presidents that Grinnell has had. We
want to publicly thank the Chi Trib for its fine work and
thank them for taking us back to kindergarten where we

too played in the mud

Letters

To the editor:

Have you ever wondered
how Grinncll's student govern—
ment stacks up in comparison
with other schools? Last week-
end three of us had an opporv
tunity to meet with tepresenta~
tives of all the Midwest Con-
ference schools and compare
notes on student government.
The occasion was the annual
Midwestern Conference on Stu»
dent Government held this year
at Carleton.

The conference opened Fri-
da night with an address by
Dean Kiile cf Carleton and short
talks by representatives of each
school on some aspect of stus
dent organization. Here we first
discovered something which was
in be driven home again and
again throughout the ccnfer.
ence. Grinncll, with all its
shortcomings, is still ahead of
most schools. Such things as
student enforcement of rules
and joint student-administration
committees are not found at
most schools.

Most councils have from 12
to 21 members and are com-
posed of hall or fraternity rep-
resenlatives and/or class offi-
cers. They usually have more
financial power than our Coun-
cil. The Council at Lawrence

Open letter to Board of
Religion applicants

The Board wishes to express
its appreciation of the interest
and concern of each one of the
45 who applied this year.

We wish that it were possible
to accept everyone who made
application, but with only nine
positions to fin this was clearly
impossible, As always it was a
matter of having several good
persons for each position. and
the decisions were not easy to
make. But we tried to make
make them without reference to

personal friendships cr regard to,

We urge those of you who are
freshmen and sophomores to
apply again next year. This is
the second year of application
for some who were chosen this
year. i!

u Ty
by Art Travers

In 1933. our Congress repeal-
ed the Volstead Act. In 1955
the administration of this insti-
tution formally outlawed the
spending of hall money for
“nail picnics". What is the
creeping menace from which
our protectors have seen fit to
guard us?

Spring is here and in ihe
spring a young man’s fancy
lightly turns to getting out on
the roof with a pair of binocu-
lars and surveying the Loose
sundeck. To protect us from
ouselves, however, the women
have passed certain regulations
These rules pertain to the at
tire Worn by the women stu-
dents decorating said sundeck.
They likewise govern women’s
garb in other areas. To wit:

1) Bathing suits are prohibs
ited in the loggia.

2) Shorts are forbidden west
of the M. 8: StlL. tracks unless
Covered by a coat.

3) Bermuda shorts may not
be worn downtown.

4) Pedal pushers (or any
thing briefer) may not be worn
to lunch or breakfast.

5) Halters are not allowed
outside.

6) Girls crawling in and out
of windows opening on sundccks
must be Covered.

There may be more but these
will do.

Now, do not mistake me. I am
not for wholesale frolicing on
the green in birthday suits or
ﬂimsies. (Or am I?) I would,
however. like to go on record
as saying that I feel that die-
tating to anyone as to what he
or she may wear (beyond the
common rules of decency) is an
infringement upon Godsgiven
rights.

Let us stop and think a mo-
ment. (A moment passes.) Did
you stop and think? Wasn’t it
fun? It seems to me that this
should be done more often be-
fore such rules are placed into
effect.

The evil in a bathing suit or
shorts and a halter is. after all,
only in the minds of the spec-
tator. l. for one, fail to find a
particle of lewdness in either
outfit, and God knows the tem—
perature has made such cos—
tumes practically necessary.

Does anyone want several
pairs of binoculars, Cheap?

Report, dated April 14: “Dur-

ing the course of the meeting”

Mr. Wynberg asked the Council
if he had the right to vote at
meetings. He was given lhc
right to vote, inasmuch as he is
basically a student at heart. Be-
sides, he's been voting all year
long. anyway, and it wouldn’t
do to upset precedent at this

Reviews Maverick

Edward Luck (speech) was
elected chairman of the new
Committee on Publications this
week. The new committee which
replaces lhe Board uf Publicas
licns was the subject of con-
troversy during its formative
stages due to the change in
student faculty ratio, and publi-
cations representation.

Ragsdale, representing zhejour-
nalism department; Don Brooks
M. J. Poynter, and Ken Kasses
ibaum. representing the students-
at-large; and Jerry Tryrnlinson
representing the publications.

A letter from the editors of
MAVERICK was presented rc-
qucsiing that MAVERICK be
given authorization to continue
publication. The main' policies
proposed were as follows: six
issues a year, selling at 25
cents per copy or $1.35 for a
year‘s subscriptilm.

Profits would be divided on
a percentage basis among the
entire operating siadf and con-
tributors, except for a sum set
aside as a reserve fund. MAV-
ERICK would have full freedom
to solicit advertising.

The Committee will meet
again on Tuesday to consider the

bring outmoded portions up

rigid that lthey have had to be
rewritten frequently.

ty committees. George Drake
will serve on the committee
on Public Events and Betty
Gough and Dick Lehre'r will
