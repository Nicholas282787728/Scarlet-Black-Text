APRII. PEACE WEEK

This week is National April Pence week.
The movement is sponsored by numerous
peace organizations, and many colleges in
all parts of the country participate in its
program. A wide variety of programs is
used Classes go on strike in demonstration
against wa' Other campuses sponsor
parades, carrying signs which give vent to
their vehement feelings on the subject.
Fiery speeches are given expressing the
sentiments of various students in no un-
certain terms. Many students fast, and
others live on war rations for a day. At
Oberlin, the Organizations Council is per—
forming a mock mobilization program for
the next war.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

Some of these activities are more
worthwhile than others, but all of them
attempt to demonstrate the student feeling
on the subject of war and peace. Every
student should realize that this question of
war vitally affects him. The students of
today are the governors of tolnorl'mv. War
is not some vague problem that is to be
looked at from afar, and forgotten. It "
something that we all may have to face in
the near futule, and a problem we should
all approach with a serious and intelligent
attitude Student opinion, if properly
utilized, can have a Vast effect on the
course of affairs in this country.

The plebescite taken Monday night con-
stitutes the Grinnell program [or April
Peace Week. It could have been much more
elaborate, but it will have accomplished its
purpose if it does no more than to bring
every student to the realization of the
problem he faces, and to the realization of
the part he may have to play in our future.

OUR OWN “AQUACADE”

Thursday will see the revival on a
greatly expanded scale of a college “water
carnival," sponsored by the Splash club
under the guidance of Doyle Reynolds,
swimming coach.

Judging from Billy Rose’s success with
the Aquacade at the Cleveland exposition
last summer, such a show should be popu—
lni'. Like that show it has its share of
feminine pulchritude, and while the girls
are not as famous as Eleanor Holm and her
colleagues, we’ll wager they will “be all
right” in those white bathing suits.

Purely aside from such considerations,
however, we are glad to see the idea of a
water carnival revived: Also, we are glad
to have men as well as women participating.
The show ill its present form is in every
sense a college project and one of interest
to every. one.

Tomorrow’s the night when our own
“aquacade” will startle the campus with a
display of hitherto unheard of skill and
beauty.

GIT MEANS GO
Reprinted from the Daily O’Collcg/ialt
A team of purebred Percheron horses,
block, sleek and heavy animals, has a dozen
times the ”go” of a couple of old, holly nags.
When the teamster says “git,” the former
team can go. Pul‘ebi‘eds have what it takes
to get results. Nags are not worth their salt
No organization can function at near
capacity with inefficient supel'alilluated elli-
ployees. When the manager commands “git,”
they have no go. They, like the team of
nags, are not worth their salt.

The prize application letter
written by one of the current
graduating class was that sent
by a senior in Kelly to the Bell
Telephone company. Beginning
with the sclutcticn "Darling,”
and continuing in similar vein
throughout, the message would
undoubtedly have evoked an im—
mediate reply had it been read by
company officials, The letter was
never read, however, for the said
senior discovered after mailing it,
that he sent the note intended for
his girl to the telephone company
and vice-verse. .An urgent tele-
gram to the prospective employer
retained the intimacy of the let-
ter for me couple.

Ever since Mrs. Leonard. 0|)-

rabbits housed in her cottage two
years ago, the boys of Sigma
Delta Chi have been searching
for a new type rabbit to over
come her objections. They are
now happy to report that Mrs,
Lconard no longer need worry
about the rabbits keeping her
awake at night stamping their
feet, should someone in her cot-
Lage win the award. While the
committee is not disposed to re-
veal the type of animal to be
presented, they guarantee' that
their night antics (the rabbits,
that is) will not cause sleepless
nights at the quadrangle.
