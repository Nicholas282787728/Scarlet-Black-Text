Sacred Harp singers
preserve old art form

by Lucy mattingty
Grinneti students have a chance

to “discard their earthly material
t matters and raise their hearts and
minds to more glorious heights" on
.Sunday, April it, when the
Celestial Sacred Harp Singers will
appear in concert in licrrick
Chapel, The concert, which begins

at 7 pm, will ieature traditional

.iiapc note singing by the Celestial
Sacred Harp Singers, gospel and
radio hymns by an octet, and a
dulcimer duct,

The original Celestial Sacred
Harp Singers icelestial is their own
adjective) were the result oi an
independent research project done
three years ago by Joe retdman,
’75. He was a theatre and music
major interested in traditional iolk
singing. Traditional sacred harp
singing goes back much further,

thowever The music in The sat-toil
Ilzu'p II ‘mnal. which the Celestial
Singers use: dates from the 13th

Eenlury in New England. The
hymns are religious in nature and
are hased on Scripture passages or
events which affected the lives of
the writers.

The major dliierence between
the hymns these writers produced
and “regular” hymns is that it is
not necessary tor the Sacred Harp
Singers to be able to read music.
Sacred harp music is based on
intervals; a certain pitch is given
at the beginning oi the hymn and
the singers proceed by intervals
recognizable by the shape of the

otes.

Pal lrwln, director of the
Celestial Sacred Harp Singers,
pointed out that the purpose oi this
group at Grinnell is ior enjoyment
hd ”celestial decadence " He said
that the 25 members of the choir
are not music majors, but just
students who like to get together
and sing.

The Celestial Sacred Harp
Singers are one oi a very low
choirs oi this type. lrwtn stated

choir is on the Bicentennial Roster
in Washington, Dc. as a group
which is preserving American
tradition. They have sung at
churches in town, the Lion's Club.
(‘il‘innell High School, and can
occasionally be iound singing in
the Forum or library,

irwin commented that the Iuture
OI the choir is uncertain since “the
nucleus is still members from the
original group founded three years
ago.” However, he feels that
they're really ”celestial folks
trying to bring celestial music to
the people,” He’s “seen the iuture
oi sacred harp singing and it’s the
Celestial Sacred Harp Choir!“

condemn the real murderer of Dr.
King; to expose the collaboration
of our ‘Iaw and order' and White
racism: and to continue the
struggle by giving materlal sup

to an April. 196t'l edition oi The

recognition sought

Bierman, who has been respon-
sible for getting other Grinncll
historical attractions registered,
consulted Todd R, Mozingo,
historic preservation ofﬁcer [or the
State Historical Society in Iowa
City. about the buildings’
preservation.

Wall said Mozingo thinks there is
a very good chance that the
buildings and the Campus could
become registered. The only
nineteenth century buildings
remaining on campus, Mears and
Goodnow are both architecturally
outstanding, Wall said. Goodnow.
tor example, is “a iine example oi

Richardson architecture,”.he said.
Made of rare Sioux Falls granite, it
was built right alter the great
cyclone oi 139s, Mears is a iormer
president's house.

Chances of the entire college
area becoming recognized appear
to be good also, Wall said, because
many oi the dorms are examples
of old Skidmorc. Owing and
Merrill architecture, a nationally
prominent iirm. Many oi the
neighboring houses are also
historically signiﬁcant.

President Turner has expressed
enthusiasm for these efforts.
