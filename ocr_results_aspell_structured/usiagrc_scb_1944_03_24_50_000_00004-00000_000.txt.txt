Governmen’r and
Year's Acﬁvi’ties

student government at Grinnell
has always been one of the inside
tutions of which we as students
here are most proud. We look

into the policies of other schools.

and find we are very far ahead
of many in our actual working
pattern.

1 was asked to write about stu-
dent government, but I've found
it very hard to limit my discus-
sion to so few words as I am al-
lowed here. Our government is
very democratic and very success-
ful, which are two of the highest
merits I could give it. Let me
try to tell you briefly our system
and relate a few of the things we
as leaders of the student govern-
ment are called upon to do.

Our organization is fairly sinlr
pie 7 it copsiss of the three
bodies, the Lop governmental
group being the student council
This in itself is composed of two
councils, the central and the gen
eral council. On the general
council are students elected from
each of the balls or cottages to
represent those groups. This body
meets with the central committee
once a month to discuss general
campus problems. The cential
committee is the working governs
ing body, composed of nine incin-
ners: two representatives from
each upper class, plus the League
Board president, the president of
the Council of House Presidents
and the president of the student
council The central committee
meets once a week and discusses
anything within the province of
student interest. We, in other
words, draw up the policies,

Under the student Council,

are indirectly connected to this
general scheme and we all workl
together.

In general the student council’s
10b is to listen to everyone's
gripes, discuss them, and decide
what can be done. We are a kind
of mediator between the students
and faculty in many cases, but
this is only the beginning. Let's
take a look at the past year and
point out the events in which the
student council has played a d!»
rect part.

In the spring we sponsored an
event called Spring Dayiwhich
no upperrclassmen ever forgets
This is the time when we all take
a day off a both students and
faculty and have ourselves the
time of our lives, cleaning up thei
campus, having a big picnic lunch;
and looting the rest of the after-i
noon.
