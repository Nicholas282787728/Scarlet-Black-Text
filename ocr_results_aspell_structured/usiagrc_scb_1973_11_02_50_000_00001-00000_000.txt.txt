ording to separate Scarlet andBlack

ponded to a written survey distri-

‘jbuted Tuesday. The students:

' Favored resignation 72% to 16%,
with 13% undecided. ,
Favored impeachment proceedings
76% to' 11%, with 16% undecided.
Felt the President was not justl-
fied in firing Archibald COX as
‘ Watergate special prosecutor 91%
to 5%, with 3% undecided.

The survey was administered Mon.

lation by White House lawyers that
some oi the controversial “water-
gate tapes" had never existed.

Poweshiek County

A random telephone surveyoiWes-
tern Poweshiek County residents,
which included Grinnell, Malcom,
Kellogg, and Rock Creek plus some
outlying rural areas, had markedly
different results.

Of the 88 residents surveyed:

50% felt the President should not

resign, while 31% felt he should

and 19%,were undecided.

. .26% felt the President should be
impeached, while 52.8% felt he
should not.

47.3% felt the firing of Cox was
not justified, while 34.2% felt the

President made the proper deci-

sion.

This sampling covered till resi-
dences with telephones in the Grine
neli or Maicom exchanges, and his
eluded rural areas of the county
and parts ofKellogg and Rock Creek.

Calls were made Tuesday and Wed-

'nesday, with the iinal calls coming
' after the White House tapes ann-
ouncement. However, respondents
were either not yet aware of the
announcement or had not had time
to think about the development when
contacted

Reaction to the latest Watergate
development appeared to be stune
ned disbelief.

Ed Gilmour, First District Demos
cratic Committeeman, describedthe
revelation as “incredible ” Headd-
ed, ‘Something has to give. Its
Orwellian."

And historian Joseph Wall, who is
leading a Grinnell Committeetoime
peach the President, noted “This is
just one more preposterous act in
the whole drama, If this doesn’t
finally canvince the American peo-
ple, then anything can go."

IN WASHINGTON, earlier in the
week, members of Iowa‘s Congres»
sional delegation reacted to floods
of mail about the unfolding Waters
gate developments.

CONGRESSMAN SENATOR
ED MEZVINSKY DICK CLARK

First District Congressman Ed
Mezvinsky, a member of the House
Judiciary Committee which is now
investigating the possibility oi im-
peachment, commented, “It took
Mr. Nixon’s own eratic and reck-
less actions ot the past week to
push millions of Americans to be-
gin to think the unthinkable: that
there is a critical need today to
begin impeachment proceedings”

Staff assistants to the Iowa Demo-
crat said that 1200 letters and tele»
grains had been received in the
Washington Mezvinsky office since
Cox was iired, at which more than
1100 called for the beginning of im-
peachment proceedings,

They added that the mail volume

, had not decreased as they had ex-

pected alter Nixon agreed to re-
lease the controversial tapes to

Federal Judge John Sirlca,

Aides to laws Junior Senator,
Dick Clark, reported that as of
Tuesday‘ night 1671 letters, teles
grams and recorded telephonemes-
sages had been received urging the
impeachment of the President, while

and Katie Simonton.

They added that, of these, 325
indicated that the correspondents
favored impeachment despite the
release oi the tapes. ‘

in a news column writtenlastweek,
Clark noted, ”Few' times in our
history has this country experienced
such a compelling need ior iirm and
open leadership as now.” ,

He continued, “Coniidence in go
verhment is a iragile item. it takes
a long time to build, but it can be
destroyed relatively quickly.

“American cannot afford that. We
need the strength of our people to
back us up when we act, on both
domestic and international fronts,

“The only way we can get that
strength is by trusting the people
and giving them totally trank and
honest government.“

Many individuals have commented
on the recent events. A Grinnell
student noted, “The presentadmini-
stration is the most corrupt in
American history.”

Another said, “i feel that Nixon
'is mentally unbalanced and has been
ior some time.”

A third, who indicated support ior
ithe 'President, noted “A man is
innocent until proven guilty."

sts added lite to the discussions,

For the tirst time, a woman is

cil, while Grinnell’s iirst 18-year

"old municipal candidate is staging

Dr’s office.

selleproclaimed socialist, Andy Mce
kibben, has declared publicopposis
tion to five-term incumbent mayor,
Floyd Beaver, and is a serious
candidate, although his name will
not appear on the ballot.

The first woman to enter Grinnell

‘beauty salon owner, who is running
ior one oi the two atvlarge council
seats. Vying with her are incum-
bents John Hotchkin, Kevin Grliiin,

GANG BANG
The James Gang Bang will
be held in the Quad dining
hall tomorrow irom 9 p.m.
to about 1 a.m. Joint Sess-
ion, a band from Kansas City
will play beginning at 9:30.
Beer and punch will be ava-
ilable along with munchies.

Wallace, and John Miller are unope
posed.

All the candidates perceive definite
problems facing the city ot'Grinnell.
Major issues raised at the meeting
included establishment of more low:
rent housing, better city planning,
zoning beyond the city limits, and
expansion of public facilities,

improvements in city employee
heneiits, continuation/01' newspaper
recycling, pedestrian crossing lie
ghts ior Highway 146 and ways at
increasing community spirit were
also discussed.

Alt present agreed that the hous-
ing problem is the most important
issue. They also agreed that proper
city planning is necessary to avoid
“last minute” repair jobs, and that
a zoning ordinance to cover con
struction near Grinnell but outside
the city limits is needed.

Mayor Beaver expressed a desire
to continue to run Grinnell as effecs
tively as possible. He expressed sps

ecial interest in lutureplanningdure'

ing his sixth term in diiice.

‘ Mckibben is advocating “sociale
iSt” city government "aimed atime
priving the quality of life for the
people.“ Toward this end, he intro-
duced ideas for low rent housing
and housing tor the elderly, and
substantial improvements for the
city park system, especially Arbor
Lake.

Among the ail-large candidates, Etc
seman advocated planning and said
beneiits ioi- city employees should
be increased to bring them in line
with those available in commercial
positions

Grillin, running lor “either my
fourth or fifth term," felt that cur—

rent city programs should beallow-
ed to develop to completion. Healso
indicated that attention shouldbegi-

yen to the maintenance of facilities '

and the eiiects of an impending
15% property tax hike.
Lucille Ahrens stressed the need

, tor city planning and development.

She emphasized that “Grinnell is
our town (and) should be put on
the map.”

John Hotchkin, who has twenty
years experience in Grinnell city
government as City Clerk, Mayor,
and Councilman, feels that this gives
him an edge in serving the city.
One oi his major concerns in this
campaign is the Grinnell watersyse
tem.

In the First Ward contest, Rick
Ramsey indicated strong supportfor
city planning. Ramsey wants acum-
plete assessment ofthe current “li-
ving space” situation, without a
great deal of bureaucratic snags.
He said consideration should he gis
yen to reducing the standard lot and
street widths as one possible solue
tion,

Ramsey also urged strong support
for the Grinnell Humaanghts Come
mission, adding that it should ac~
tively educate the community about
discrimination and associatedprobe
lems. '

Paul Ahrens, Ramsey's opponent, ,

agreed with Eiseman‘s proposal for
city employee benelits, and added
that the possibility o1 pedestrian
lights ior West Street (highway 146)
should be investigated,

The polls will open at 7 a.m. and
remain open until a pm

‘I HAVE DONE THE DEED'MH‘ (

PETS, PUB, PEACHMENT

SGA Covers Gamof

by John Turubull
Cowles Absent.

This Wednesday the Joint Boards
came together after mid-sem break,
and amid much minor banterlng,
confusion and Halioweenfervor, acte
ed upon several significant issues.

First in the order of business was
the Pet Policy. Members of the
Pet Board came before the Joint
Boards asking for opinions oi the
very lenient enforcement policy of
the pet regulations so tar this year.
Until now, only those dogs involved
in reported biting incidents have
been put under scrutiny. No lines
have of yet been levied,

Faust, a member oi the Pet Board,
cited “substantial rumorsthat high-
ersups of the collegewere consider-
ing abolishing pets altogether” be
cause oi the laxity of entorcement
policy. Ellen Yacknin thus made a
motion that the Joint Boards ask
the Pet Board to enforce the cur-
rent rules as they are for all pets.
Ensulng discussion as to the approe
priateness of the motion and ques
tions at its severity did not keep
it from being passed«ll»10s0 alter
several close votes.

Faust indicated that with suchsups
port for action, the Pet Board will
begin to enlorce the pet policies
to the letter, beginning November’7.
This will include the “catching”
of any dog not on a leash or within
voice command of its owner: An
open forum for discussion oi this
matter will be held November 7
in South Lounge 111730 pm
Later action in SGA had John Han-
sen asking for the formation oi an
ad hoc ate'large committeeto“stildy
the student role in college governe
ance" and research possible proe
posals that could be brought belore
the iaculty. The membership of this
committee was hoped to be mostly
nonAsGA students, willing faculty
and any other interested new faces,
Unanimous approval was given name
sen, Kessler and Sloan to term this
committee,

»

The sudden increase of the board
rate last week also came to SGA’s
attention No student input was in-
volved in the action as Scott Wei]
cited the administration’s excuse
that they “had waited too long and
action had to be taken immediately.”

Monitoring the success at etiorts
made by SAGA with regard to im-
proving the quality and quantity oi’
their iood will be undertaken by '

the Committee on Student Services.
Towards the end of the Joint Bo—

ards meeting, Rick Faustbroughtup
another question regarding campus
fadillties Specifically, he asked
where complaints against the mana—
gemth of the Pub might be direct—
ed. He was told that as far as SGA
can be concerned, ”the Pub is a
private corporation" that makes
its own operating policies. Thus
the only possible organization tor
arbitration would be the Office of
Community Rights. Pub manager
Mark Nissen indicated his present
policies would soundly reflect his
past actions until further notice.
In a somewhat lighter note, SGA
also decided to follow Coe Col-
lege's lead and send letters to
Senators Hughes and ClarkandCon-
gressman Mezvinsky calling for
support or presidential impeach»
ment. Nixon would also be asked
to resign. President Leggett and
anybody else on campus were urg-
ed to follow now both Grinnell’s and
Coe‘s student government’s examp-
les.
