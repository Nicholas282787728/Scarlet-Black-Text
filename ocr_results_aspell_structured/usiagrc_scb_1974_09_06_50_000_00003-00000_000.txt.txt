—It’s peace he desires

by Abbi Swanson

As oi September second, the
query ”Can I please have a bus
ticket to Chicago?" and all similar
requests, will no longer be
responded to by Bo Battey.
Otherwise known as “Texaco Bo,”
Battey has been a iamiliar iigure
to hundreds of Grinnellians during
the past six years.

Bo has made the decision, “for
reasons oi health and wealth,” to
discontinue managing the Grinnell
Greyhound Bus depot, located at
80’: Texaco, on the corner of 6th
and West.

_ DepotTi-ansierred

Due to managerial difﬁculties,
the transier of the Greyhound Bus
station to the Park Hotel, 315 Broad
SL, has been delayed for the im-
mediate iuture. in the meantime,
Bo will continue to operate the
depot on a contingency basis.

Further, and for similar reasons,
Bo has decided to abandon the
gasoline business at Texaco
completely. Negotiations are now
in progress in thc search tor a new
leasing agent for the substation.
Bo’s hopes are that a local in-
dividual would be iound before the
15th 0i this month.

Transitions

This appears to be the last in a
series of recent transitions at Bo's
Texaco. Included among those was
the transier of the UrHaui rental
service, once rendered by Bo, and
currently located at Rick's
Phillips 66 station, located at the
junction of Hwy. 146 and Interstate
80.

Meditators add

Addressing approximately 40
Grinnell students last Tuesday,
Roger Leahy gave an introductory
lecture on Transcendental
Meditation. The presentation,
which lasted 40 minutes, was given
in Science ‘71. The lecture was
considered to be a requirement ior
those wishing to learn the
technique oi Transcendental
Meditation. The same introduction
was repeated on Wednesday, Sept.
4.

Leahy oi Fella, Iowa, is certified
by the Students’ International
Meditation Society as an instructor
of meditation. He defined Tran-
scedental Meditation as “a
technique or deep rest which is
preparation ior activity, yet has
eiiects on every aspect of life.”

He stated that aiter a student oi
Transcendental Meditation had
attended the two required lectures
(the second one to be given at a
later date) and paid a fee oi $65, he
was then given three private
lessons, totaling «to hours. During
this time period the student is
taught actual technique,

Anomer moderation at Texaco
was the recent installation of a self-
service gasoline pump. Also, for a
short period of time earlier this
spring, Bo closed the gas pumps.

Attended the College

Bo is no stranger to Grinnell, or
to other parts of the state of Iowa.
in 1946, B0 moved with his family
to Oskaloosa. Iowa, where he
completed high school in 1948. Bo
then attended Grinnell College for
one semester, leaving in February
of 1949, Bo’s brother also attended
the college, graduating in 1951 as
a student in journalism. He was. at
one time, editor oi the Scarlet and

City in February 1949. There he
was to reside ior almost twenty
years.

Initially, Bo helped his uncle
keep bread on the table by
assisting him in aspects of the
photography business.

Sells Pctunias

various reasons provoked a
change in jobs for Bo alter a short
period. His next enterprise was the
sale oi petunias in a plant nursery.

ditional instruction that may be
desired to expand the student’s
knowledge of technique or theory.
Meditating

Leahy went to explain that
Transcendental Meditation for 20
minutes twice a day results in a
rest that is twice as deep as sleep.
This rest, according to Leahy.
removes the individual’s tensions,
allowing the individual’s System to
heal itself.

Several scientific studies were
distributed to the audience which
supported the beneiits claimed by
Transcedental Meditation. Some oi
these beneiits were improvement
oi memory, an increase in
academic grades, improvement of
both physical and psychological
health, and a reduction of personal
anxiety.

Misconceptions

In the course at the presentation,
Leahy answered questions that
pertained to misconceptions about
Transcendental Meditation,
Several Grinnell students inquired
whether Transcendental

a welder's assistant. The Weider
demanded slightly more work than

Bo desired to after, so this job '

lasted only for six days.

Wishing to widen his horizons of
experience, Bo next iound work as
a truck driver tor the guano
business. As ii from habit, this not
particularly pleasant job lasted
one-and-a-half weeks,

Dry Cleaning

Subsequently, Bo iound himself
in Henderson, Nevada, employed
as a driver tor a dry cleaning
route. His consistently getting lost
on the winding streets prompted a
quick termination of yet another
job.

Bo then managed the Boulder
Theatre [or about six months,
marrying the popcorn girl,
Jeanette, in the process

Too lnany headaches forced him
to vacate that position, and he
commenced selling souvenirs in “a

On his return to Nevada. Bo
operated a photographic shop for
live years.

Then, ior one year, Bo sold '56

oi suo accounts, extended from
Cedar City, Utah, to the Mexican
border.

Following two anda hall years of
on-the»road sales, Bo opened, in his

tor the remaining seven years of
Bu's residence in Nevada, he
worked as a hydroeturbine
operator on Boulder Dam

It is almost six years to the day
that 80 and Jeanette Battey, with
their three children, returned to
Grinnell and leased the Texaco
station. Reminiscing, he recalls
that Sept, 3, 1963 was the day he

opened ior business in town. “After _

six years oi this, it’sa wonder I’m
not in a home,” Bu remarked.

Asked about his fondest
memories while working at
Texaco, Bo quickly responds that it

Meditation could prove harmful to
some people, and ii Trans
scendental Meditation might
prevent them lrom delving into
other areas oi mindexpandment.
Leahy answered that nothing
harmful has been iound in Tran-

practiced as taught. so long as the
individual can separate what he
receives from Transcendental
Meditation and what he receives
irom other types of mind-
expandment.
