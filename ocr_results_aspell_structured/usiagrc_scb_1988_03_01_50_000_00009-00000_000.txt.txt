If a proposal to institute
general education re
quirements came up next
year, what would you do'.7
What actions would you
take?

Rob Killion

Contrary to some of my pubs
licized campaign statements 1
would not impose a stricter core
curriculum. i would, rather, op-
pose any sort of stricter core
curriculum. First of all, as
the chair of Student Council
and Curriculum 1 would imme
diately let the arc chairs and
representatives know what’s go—
ing on so they can get back
to their EPCs where 1 think a
great majority of the work has
to be done in individual depart7
ments, throughout the faculty in
those departments, and through
meetings between the EPCs and
the department chairs. 1 would
also ask the s and B for 337
sistance and use any publicity
available to keep the students
aware of what’s going at all
times. Because if there was ever
any suggestion of a proposal for
a core curriculum, that’s some
thing that strikes a cord, and

rightly so, with so many people.
It would be dangerous, it would
be wrong, it wouldn’t be a good
idea for anyone involved if for
any amount of time I didn’t let
the students know what was go
ing on. To summarize, through
Student Council on Curriculum
I would let the EPC chairs know
what’s going on and have them
work within their different de-
partmerits. I would keep the
students informed about what’s
going on. And thirdly, I’d
be very vocal in the curricu7
lum committee about my disap-
proval of this as the main stu-
dent representative of the Stu-
dent Government Association.

if there were specific require
merits saying every student had
to take one of these courses, one
of these science courses or this
math course or this language
course, then 1 would disagree
with it. 1 like the way the sys.
tem is setup now saying we have
to take something in each divi»
sion. 1 might agree with some
thing more strict than that but
not a core curriculum. 1 would
leave it as open to the student
as possible because the decision
should be left to the student.
Anything less than that would
not be liberal for the student,
and that’s who is basically get
ting the education.

Cathy Baldwin

llopefully I would be ahead
of the game in already insti»
gating my proposal to asters
tain what exactly the consenr
sus is on this campus. As far

Expertem‘e

working with the professors 7
also with Student Council on
Curriculum 7 with professors
coming in, I’ve been in contact
with them asking questions, like
Mr. Smith and others. I’m
beginning to lose my train of
thought. I general, I’ve worked
with them, I’m familiar with
them, I feel 1 know how to deal
with both faculty and adminis-
tration. I’m not going to go in
and make demands. 1 know you
have to give and take. And 1
think l can do it.

Vice-Presidential Interviews

as, is this program of value to
our college or is it something
which would hurt more students
than it would help. l can’t say
right now what the overall stu—
dent opinion is, it’s diverse as
is our campus. 1 would meet
that proposal with another pro—
posal or at least a statement of
what this campus thinks about
it. Because before with the 3-2
Idon’t think that type of state-
ment came out. It was left to the
EPCs to deal with their depart.
ments and tell them whether or
not they thought it was a good

idea and work with them on the
proposals that were to be for»
warded to Dean Duke. This
time 1 would like to see this cam—
pus united BEFORE the prob
lem arises. if such a proposal
would come out i think 1 would
immediately begin proceedings
through the Student Curricu-
lum Council and the EPCs and
through Joint Board. it needs
to be more than just EPC reps
resentatives. Too many times
representatives are not entirely
representative of the people they
are supposed to be representing
which is unfortunate, and an
other problem I‘d like to work
on. But it concerns all stu-
dents and so as many opinions
as we can get. Maybe surveys
would be the answer or a spe
cial adrhoc committee could be
set up. There are a variety of
ways to approach the problem,
but 1 think 1 would begin in Cur~
riculum Council by determining
and ascertaining what the gen.
eral opinion ofthe campus is and
then Write a statement to that
effect.

Stephanie Redman

One thing that’s very impor7
tant is obviously ﬁnding out how
students feel, and 1 think gen-
erally the campus is highly ops
posed to any sort of structured
curriculum, if for some rear
son there were an overwhelming
rush of support for that sort of
thing, I’d work in every possi-
ble way to achieve it, with the
administration and the faculty.
But 1 have a feeling that that
would not be the ease.

Chris Gunst

I’m very against it. 1 would
start out saying ‘no we don‘t
want this,‘ but there’s a dif—
ference between core curriculum
and core requirements. 1 don’t
want either. i have more than
kind ofa vested interest in it be
cause I’m dyslexic and 1 cant
have big classes. 1 think core
curriculum or core requirement
would institute some big classes.
l would do everything within
SGA’s power, which would be
start an initiative, discuss it
with all the members of the
trustees, faculty and adminis
tration because basically 1 think
it’s a bad idea. They’re reason-
able people, they‘ll see it’s a bad
idea. And if they don’t, then
we protest like we did over 3-
2, and write an initiative. Ev-
ery time the Academic Advis
ing Committee meets, you rant
and rage. l3ut sadly, as 32
showed, the administration can
pass something like that right
over our heads. We can’t do
much, but I’d do as much as pos—
sible.

Tom Worth

1 would oppose it because
that's the reason I came here.
That’s tlle reason a lot of stu~
dents came here, and I feel that
I’d be representing student opin-
ion by opposing it directly. It
depends on how strongly the
people, whether it’s Walker or
the faculty or whoever’s propOSr
ing it, feel about it, and how
much power they have to get
it through. If I feel we have
enough power 7 if it goes to
Curriculum Committee, and we
have three students and, I think,
four faculty 7 if we can get

How realistic are your
campaign promises?

Rob Killion

I believe my campaign promr
ises are very realistic because 1
am very familiar with the job
have worked with Ali ElSalfar. 1
know the work he’s done, 1 know
how he works, 1 know what can
be done and lknow what can’t
be done. And i think my cam.
paign goals are realistic because
1 have made a good balance be
tween things that l can promise
1 can do and things that 1 can
say 1 will work on to the best
of my ability. For example, 1
can promise that there will be an
son student handbook. And 1
can say that 1 will work as hard
as i can to get more faculty af-
ter the initial year of 3.2, and
I’ve been careful not to give the
impression that I’m promising
that. 1 think I’ve struck 1 good
balance between the promises i
can make and the things that 1
can work at.

Jet“ Fields

I believe my campaign prams
ises are realistic. I have
promised to try to do many
things. 1 have promised to work
to do many things. I will work
to do these things until it gets
to the point where they can’t be
done. There are certain things
that I refuse to lose on, such as
getting more professors. That is
something that I will not lose on.
we will get more professors. 1
have yet to make promises for
substantial things because it’s
diﬂicult to say ‘I will do this‘ un-
til 1 actually get there. 1 know
what I want to do, I know how
I want to do it, and I know who
can help me do it. That’s what
my promises are

Cathy Baldwin

1 think they are very realistic.
I don’t propose any sweeping
measures for anything, because
1 know there are three types of
time frames. There is the stun
dcnt time frame, which is com-
prised of four years in which you
live and work and play at this
college; then there is bureaus
cratic time, which I think ova
eryone knows about; then there
real time, that most of the world
functions on. There are times
when a student comes to you
with a proposal and, for exam-
ple we started a proposal for the

student Center because it was
a need that needed to be ad»
dressed, my freshmen year. It’s
taken us three years, moving
back and forth through various
channels, to plan and organize
and ascertain exactly what are

three students’ and a few profes—
sors’ support, then we’ll just op-
pose it directly, and 1 think we
could probably stop it. If not,
if it looks like we can’t get that
kind of support and it’s going
to go through, if there‘s nothr
ing we can do to stop it, which
seems to be the case more often
in academic issues because stu-
dent input is limited 7 oh yeah,
and also referendums, I think
that would be a really effective
tool if the students are against
it. But also, as l was saying,
if it looks like it‘s going to go
through, the faculty want it, the

the needs of the students, and
formulate something that was
presentable. 1 think a lot of
times it’s very difﬁcult for stu-
dents to see how things work,
what channels we have to go
through, how many people are
involved. The more people in-
volved, the longer it takes to
get a decision. I think knowing
those channels can speed things
up.

In the implementation of the
3.2, I propose to try to make it
as smooth and as quick as pos-
sible, and painless for the stu7
dent body. The idea of making
it painless I don’t think is terri-
bly realistic, it’s bound to hurt
someone down the line. As vice-
president I would be chairing
the Student Curriculum Coun-
cil. Charlie Duke and various
faculty members have said that
it’s going to be a lean year, It’s
going to be a trying year, a test»
ing year. I think that, in that
sense we have to have our feelers
out and, working through the
EPC’s and Curriculum Coun
cil and taking that information
back to the Curriculum Corns
mittee is the best way to resolve
those problems quickly. ‘

Another issue 1 was address-
ing was the core curriculum. It’s
kind of died down as the 372 has
taken the forefront, but I think
that it’ll probably pop up again.
Again, 1 think the more coma
munication and available infor-
mation we have on what people
think and what people want, the
better we can determine what
our goals are. i think that more
discussion is certainly in order.
1 think that we can probably
come up with a general idea
from the students, through the
EPC’s and Curriculum Council,
where we stand. So far we’ve
been tossing around opinions.
I’d like to draw up somcthing
that says ‘this is what the cane
pus tlnnks,’ if it does become a

viable issue, then we’re prepared
to deal with it.

Stephanie rtedmrrn

I’d say very realistic in that
I’m not promising anything that
I don’t think can be achieved.
12m not really promising any
thing. There are a lot of things
that 1 think need attention, that
need work, specifically outlined
in my statement7332, buﬁer
days, some things that have
been going on. As far as that
goes, iL‘s more a case of doing
what you can to make this cams
pus a better place rather than
trying to change, achieve radir
cal change. in that sense 1 think

next, lastrditch effort 1 would
put forward is trying to come
up with something that’s in be
tween what they want and the
students want. Like at Obera
lin, they have a 16-16-16 distria
bution requirement. And say,
“Okay, well, you want some
thing more towards a core cur.
riculum. How about this.” And
so, if we can‘t avoid it en.
tirely, hopefully propose some-
thing that‘s not quite as strict
as what they want. Because
you have to work with them.
It’s hard to just simply oppose
them.

my goals are very realistic. Like
1 said, 1 know what it takes to
get things done on this cams
pus. There’s a structure that
you have to work within, and by
knowing that structure 1 think I
can achieve.

Chris Gunst

Very realistic, 1 think. rm
not advocating a week of buffer
days. 1 think Ali’s half butler
day proposal is a good one. I’d
rather see a day at least, but
I’ll go in and see what we can
do. I’ve never really been satis-
fied with the administration say.
ing ‘we can’t have buffer days
because of the schedule.’ 1 re-
alize that a2 has been passed
and it will be implemented. The
problem with that is that three
faculty is ridiculous. Grinnell
should be a place that fosters
opportunity, not cuts it back. If
we want to be best in the counr
try or whatever, that’s not the
way to do it.

On the sports teams, i think
we need sports teams but we
can’t lower standards. We just
can’t. Where we can help is
where athletes are getting loans,
maybe we can give them grants.
I realize that in SGA, to get
anything passed you have to
compromise with the faculty or
the administration. And that‘s
tough. We have to compromise
from a position of strength. We
have to know what we want and
start from there.

Tom Worth

I’ve categorized them into
what 1 think is very realistic
down to what is not very realis-
tic, I’ve been actively trying to
get ideas from students, one of
them is getting a student on the
Executive Council. In passing I
asked Mr. Don smith about it,
whose on the Executive Council
and he just said “no way, there’s
just no way,” shocked that I’d
even mentioned it. But that
would be a great place for stu-
dent input. I’m going to talk
with a few other professors, but
that’s one thing that I’d like to
do that i don’t think will hapr
pen. Also, some colleges have
put students on the board of
trustees and 1 think that would
be another good thing to do
which 1 don’t think will hap-
pen. And then-l have other
ideas which l think very well
can happen. One idea which
has been tried twice before and
failed twice before is a student
designed interdisciplinary con-
centration. I feel strongly about
