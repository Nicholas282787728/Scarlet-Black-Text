ty cash, the union announces that
320.000 was taken, hoping to make a
killing on the insurance. The robbers
become furious and decide to bribe the
union, using a notebook they took
which contains information about il-
legal loans. Llntortunately, this gets
tlle union furious, which isn’t a very
healthy thing to do,

Everything irom the acting all the
way down to the editing is superb, The
direction is excellent, catching ovcry-
nuance as we see the robbers’ attitude
change irom nervousness and an-
ticipation when they break in, to brash
overcunfidence when they decide to
bribe the union, and finally to a kind
oi paranoid hear when both the police
and the union are after them. All of
this combines to create a very power-
iul, believable portrait of union
politics,

which Way is Up stars Pryor in
three diiierent roles Unrortunately,
Pryor is not at his best in any of these
roles: in two of them he is at his
worst. Throughout the movie, we
watch Pryor as he unwittingly gets
himself into a number of funny cir»
cumstances.

Some oi the scenes are hilarious, but
this is the exception rather than the
rule. The acting is very spotty, with
Fryers wonderful comic liming work-
