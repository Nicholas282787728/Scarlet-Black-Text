Kenyon and his peers took turns leads
mg the gloup through tough terrain. “One
tiny we were su‘andcd out on a tldgcline
hecause of a massive thunderstorm that
was right overhead,” Kenyon recalled. Sit-

nons lilte these ploduccd valuahle lead-
ership skills that he uses in everyday life.

Kenyon's science .nretest led him to
hiochemistty, a major that allowed him
to immerse himself in heavy topics while
pursuing hrs- goals ofcllnlcalwotk in rnede
icillc.

“The big
plan is I would
lake to some-
thing directly

sort of a
elurieal care

mer, Kenyon

found himself
at New York City's Bellevue Hospital,
where he found his calling,

“I worked on a [medical screening]
team that gave free health checktups to
minority populations in the erty and ecee
uomically disadvantaged populations in
the City,” Kenyon said. “I am interested in
tho science aspcct orir, but 1 really do like
working With people "

Kenynn's most recent research echoes
the internship VVotklng with Professor
David Campbell. Biology, he has been
studying malaria epidermology in the

hate enthusmst, insomniac

backdrop of refuge: populations in Paki-
Stan.

“What I r:ally like about it is it's kind
ofa combination ofthe sclencry aspect of
discase transmission and what I’ve learned
in my microbiology advaneed elective and
the social SCICI‘AEE studies that I've don:
here,"

Though he’s enjoyed hrs Gtiunell (xi
perieucc, perhaps Kenyou‘s low point was
the time he was discovelcd by one of his
blochem colleagues passed out under his
study cartel in Noyce. “I had been Working
through Friday night and wanted to get
up early on a Saturday," Kenyon said, "and
so I thought, well I could go home, like a
normal person or 1 could sleep undcrncath
this httle tieslt thingy because 1 don’t have
a life and I really \vztntcd to get this done."

When he's not working away sleeps
lessly m Noyce, Kenyon actually does have
a life.

For the past four years, the Griuuell
Grifﬁn rugby team has been a constant
source of l'ccrcation for him. “It's ‘cause
I got cut from the football [cam my freshr
man year of high school," he explained as
his discovery ofthc sport. Kenyon plays on
a club tmm with Gllnncll students as well
as community members.

Kenyon has since jolmd the football
team, which he values for the sens: that
he feels like part otsomethmg larger than
himself,

“Football was kind of the first t:al
sense ofcommunity that I got at Grinnell."

Kenyon also recollecrs walking for the
"legit” Grill. “It was just kind of one big
ol’ party."

But the most important part of Kcnr
you's seven semesters at thnnell has been
the conﬁdcncc he has gained in hrs path.
“The bAggcst thing was a very real sense of
ownership about what I’m doing with my
life," he said.

In the summer, Kenyon will return not
to his native St. Louis, but to New York
City, where he will merge has interests
of tesealch and clinical care at the NYU
Hospital and Belleyue Hospital.

Kenyon recalls the doubt about his fur
ture that :xlstcd before coming to Gnlmell

“I always hatl this kmd ofvague notion
of modicine, but not really] always kind of
questioned lftllis was really what I wanted
to do.” Kenyon said, “Even if science was
whatl really wanted—and even to be per-
fcctly honest with you, if higher education
was something I wanted to do with my life
in that time."

“The challenging environment here,
and the demands that academia place on
you really in a lot orways was a hit of a
struggle at least at ﬁrst for me, but at the
same time .x was this catalyst that allowed
me to really allow myself to say ‘this is
what I want to do’,"
