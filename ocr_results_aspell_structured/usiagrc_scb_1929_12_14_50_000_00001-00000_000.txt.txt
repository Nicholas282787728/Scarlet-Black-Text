Much Praise.

By Helen Kingery

To criticize dispassionately “Em»
peror Jones" is as impossible as to
relate calmly a harrowing experience
one has just been through, “Ema
peror Jones" was not an enjoyable
play, it was not even what one might
csdl a stirrrulating play; the play its
self, the acting, and the production
seized one's imagination too relent-
lessly for. any comfortable calcula»
tion What»ever. The steady dull
thump of the tomdtoms, the writhing
formless fears with their glittering
eyes, the phosphorescence of ,the
Crocodile’s jaws were a nightmare
actually endured.

The gripping illusion of this play
could not have been exerted without
a tremendous co-operation of all
those sharing in its production, but
the maximum of admiration must go
to Emperor Jones himself, played by
Clifton Lamb. Eugene O‘Neill has
given unlimited opportunities for im-
aginative interpretation; Mr. Lamb
exhausted every one. blent with an
emotional intensity that must have
impressed more than a college audi-
ence with its awful sincerity. If.
Mr. Lamb had not lived frenzied
panic, his spectator could have felt
his own heart pounding. his own
lungs bursting with breathless con-
vulsion; the hallucinations in die
forest were vivid to us dnly because
'Mr. Lamb saw them with an im—
agination keyed to the most ..vivid
One felt in him all the awful fears of
civilization confronting the ele-
mental.

Settings Realistic

Mr. Lamb's own acting must have
been intensified by the ’reelism of
his surrounding, All the hours
spent on the settings of this play,
which were in charge of Virginia
Read, must have been fully greti~
fied by the effect produced. Foliage,
lighting, costuming, properties, and
makeup, produced by Evelyn Edens
burn. Robert Haines and David Bair,
Vivian Esusher. Earleen Rosecrans,
and Virginia Riniker, were intrinsic
contribution to an atmosphere witlr
out which the play would have been
merely a powerful intcrprepation.—
although the atmospheric illusion
could have been more successfully
preserved had the curtain been
handled a little more conventionally.

others Actors Good

Actors other than Mr. Lamb were
given comparatively less chance for
showing any range of dramatic tal-
ent, Richard Phillips,7Smithers, the
Cockney trademiwho figured large-
ly in the first act. and appeared
again to deliver the valcdictum on
the “blarsted niggers" as the curtain
fell, employed his Cockney powers in
quite another manner than in “Wine
ﬂows" of last spring. His ability to
be perfectly at ease and in command
of any role constantly commands our

Professors, Coaches, Administration

Use Movies to TeachfPredict Talkies

Motion pictures are now being us-
ed in four departments of Grinnell
college. and in as many different
ways, Dean John S. Nollen has even
predicted that talkies can be used in
foreign language instruction.

Coach G. Lester Duke ﬁrst took
movies of George McCully Grinnell's
star highsjumper last year in order
to prove that McCully followed the
national rule which provides that one
foot must precede the other over the
bar. in several meets the judges
questioned McCully's style, but the
movie clearly showed that his one
foot did go over before the other.
Coach Duke was also able to point
out technique in hurdling and high
jumping by means of ﬁlms.

“I think before long movies will
be taken of the ﬁnish of all import—
ant races, so that there will be no
controversy as to who was the win-
ner," Mr. Duke said. Several years
ago one of our star men, Paulu,:went
to the Pennsylvania relays and the
judges gave him only second place.
although the pictures that came out
in the paper the next morning, show-
ed clearly that he was ﬁrst. If
movies could be taken of the ﬁnish
and developed within ﬁve or ten‘ min-
utes, these situations would not
arise."

Circmistry Movies Shown.

Once every week for about a Sem—
ester during the last three years
Prof. L. P. Sherman of the chem-
istry department has shown ﬁlms on
the making of different chemical
products. but he thinks that tslkies

will be even more instructive in the
future. When he attended the con-
vention of the American Chemical
Society last year a lecture with the
talkie was given by Dr Ervin Langs
mmr, chemist for the General ElecA
tric company and one of tlle out
standing scientists in the United
States. The picture showed Dr.
Langmuir speaking, and gave close-
ups of Lhe work he was doing with
his hands, so that the audience could
see the details much better than if
he were really speaking,
‘Alumni Soc College

As part of his work keeping the
alumni informed on what Grinnell is
doing Henry w. Matlack, alumnirsec—
retary, has taken two reels of movies
which will be available for gather-
ings of former Grinnell students at
any time. These ﬁlms include scenes
of all the buildings, football games,
the Homecoming crowd, the faculty,
the women's dancing class, and the
football men in practice. The pic-
tures were also made with the idea
of incrcasing interest in Grinnell
among high school students.

Since movies are'being used so

much in high schools and junior col-,

leges Prof. Milton Wittler of the
education department is teaching his
prospective teachers how to use the
.movie camera and projector.

“Visual education is being stress-
ed in schools all over the country.
and it is necessary that students
who are planning to teach should
know how to operate a camera,
Professor Wittler said.

January Issue of Magazine
Has lndividualistic Idea
for Theme.

The January issue of the Melteascr

vidualistic situation as the campus

taff.

The interview which appears in the
alumni section is with Mr. Charles A,
Rawson, noted business man and
public official. Kenneth Clayton is

feature by Robert Swift, entitled "In-
dividual Thinking” carried out that
theme of the issue. The other fee»
turo entitled Free Speech is by Sylvia

Freshmen Lead
in Cage Series

Beat Seniors, Juniars; Are
Doped to Defeat Sophs .
This Afternoon.

A fast and accurate freshman
basketball team had practically’as-
sured itself of the interaelass title
yesterday, by overwhelming both the
juniors and seniors in‘ their ﬁrst two
games of the interciass basketball
series which started Wednesday and
will end today. Only their game with
the sophomores rested between them
and the championship today and it
was not expected‘that this game would
present great difficulties. The score
of the frosh—senior‘game was 33710, of
the frosh-junior game, 20-14.

The series opened Wednesday after-
noon, with the seniors beating the
sophs in a close game. 18—14, and the
freshmen winning from the juniors.
Yesterday afternoon the preps walked,

i ran and climbed all over the seniors to

win by the score of 33-10. While it
was generally expected that the preps
would win, still the game was predict-
ed to be Closey but the seniors, lack-
ing substitutes and teamwork, faded
out of the picture before the game
was many minutes old.
Sophs heat Juniors.

The second game Friday afternoon
witnessed the closest game of the
series so far, the sophomores getting a

for two new men in the fray with a

men may he changed for defensive
work.

Ruff and Minier, both lettermen,
will probably see action. Both work-
ed as forwards last season but Minier
may go in at guard this season.
Murray, in addition to being a good
forward, works at guard and Wil»
helm can be shifted to forward.

Coach Cord Lipe of the visitors
plans to start O'Brien and Ruehl at
forwards, Andrew at oented, and

Capt, O'Donnell and Shipley at
guards.

Although Marquette is a nonescon-f

ference opponent, the rivalry be-
tweentthe two Schools is keen. The
visitors are in search of revenge here
due t the disappointment which they
received on the gridiron this ,t'all
when Rllff’s placekick with two
