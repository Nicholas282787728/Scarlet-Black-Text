Learn true liberal values

When I first visited Grinncll,over
a year ago,l always arrived the same
way. We’d pull off [-80, drive down
West Street, and turn onto 6th Street
after we saw the little green sign that
said “Grinncll College: Right.”

When I first visited Grinnell, as
a prospie, Grinnell College was line
ear. The “front" of the college was
the row of academic buildings down
Park Street; the library, South Cam-
pus, Forum,and other buildings were
all behind that front facade.

Today, entering my sec-
ond semester at Grinnell, the
college is a box. There is no
from, just an inside and an
outside, Grinnell has become
a home, and that means a
change in perspective,

It's amazing how imr

can be, An issue that
often appears to a
two-dimensional

out to be a complex
fl'll’téc*(llli'lcllslollill
body. For example,
President Bush has
made a big deal over the past sev-
eral years about the “transfoimative
power otlibcrty."

To a rightrthinklng Dcmocrat,
ofcourse, this comes across as a my
nipulittive smokes-crccn. All issues or
application aside, though, he’s on to
something here, When was the last

what a beautifully sublime book To

is. It’s important

This doesn't mean
agreeing with them,
just being able

A large
portion of America is more
ally opposed to the idea of gay

marriage, A not negligible niir
nority believes that homo-
sexualiiyitscltisasinand
that TOLERANCE of

a homosexual lif

is a sign ota dec _
social fabric.

Now, that
kind of (l‘llllk’
ing wouldn't ﬁnd
much support at
Glinnell. But I would say that dcnic
grating the people who hold those
opinions as Biblerthumping Nettl‘r
dertha isjust as dangerous.

It may not be possible to reach
rapport with socimteligtous consti-s
valivcs ou the issue of gay marriage.
But making the effort to undeistand
why so many people in this coun-
try havc deeply felt moral concerns
about gay marriage will benefit liberal
Grinnellians even if this action isn't
rcciprocated.

Perception can make a big differ»
ence. on my ﬁrst visit to Grinnell, as

liberal Grinnellianl.

IfGi‘innell students really want to
do their part to “use then knowledge
and their abilities to serve the com-

statement declares, then understand
ing the perspectives of those who her
have differently than us is an excel-

Pro-life, eh?

“Is it an ice cream truck?"

"Maybe it’s ScoobyrDoo's Mystery Machine Van.”

"Oh, wait what’s the big fetus on the side?"

It’s not too often that students see a multi-colored, fer
tus image~clad Vim darting down 8th Avenue, In this “Truth
Van," members of a group called Missionaries to the Pre—
Born orowa disseminated anticabortion literature through-
out campus last Friday. we poke fun at the group to help
suppress our revulsion at their antics.

Included in their “literature" were pamphlets that shOWr
cased dismembered fetuses and compared Planned Parent—
hood to the Nazis. It's hard to
conceive of a more disgusting and
tactless way to present an ideologi-
cal perspective. Necdlcss to say, we
share the outrage orthc vast major
ity of students, faculty, staff and ad-
ministration toward the incident.

In addition to grossing everyone
out, the actions of Missionaries to
the PrerBorn will most likely ens
trench the bitter divisiveness that
characterizes the abortion debate.
Last semester, the 5813 ran a staff
editorial calling for greater dialogue
on abortion. It’s hard to envision a constructive conversation,
however, when one side views the other as Nazis.

With that said, it's also important to remember that not
all pro-lifets are raging Christian fundamentalists.While ran
tional discourse will likely fail to achieve results with Mis-
sionaries to the Pre-Born, it will almost certainly do so with
moderate groups such as the Grinnell Pro-Lire Group. A to-
rum bringing together voices on campus from both sides of
the aisle would he a welcome response to Friday’s evei ~ It
could simultaneously show our unity as Grinncllians against
political demagoguery and also demonstrate that we can
transcend the bitter strife separating most prorlifers and pmr
choicers.

It’s unfortunate that Missionaries to the Pre-Born appears
to be more concerned with inducing shock than with produc-
ing results, Although most ofus on staff are pro-choice, we
do recognize that abortion is an extremely difﬁcult decision
for a woman to make; the very act ofchoice should be avoid—
ed ifpossible, but made widely available ifthcre are few other
options. President Bill Clinton operated from this perspec»
tive and saw the abortion rate plummet 22 percent during his
term. Rather than continue on a downward trend, Christian
pro—life theologian Glen Stassen notes that the abortion rate
has risen substantially under President Bush. In fact, 52,000
more abortions occurred in 2002 than would have been ex»
pected based on the previous trend.

President Bush’s destructive economic agenda lies at the
heart of the increase. Two—thirds ofwoinen say they abort
because they cannot afford a child. Ahikc in the unemploy-
ment rate and decline in average real incomes has done much
to exacerbate some women’s fear that they lack the means to
suppoit a child. IfM' ‘lOl‘lill’lCS to the PrerBorn utilized their
zeal to advocate for progios ve economic tefmm, they would
more effectively achieve their own ends. Since Christianity
teaches that fruits (results) matter more than words (Luke
6:43745), the group's own values suggest it should shift to a
more pragmatic, and palatable, approach. Plus, a “Social Jus—
tice Van" would be way cooler anyway.
