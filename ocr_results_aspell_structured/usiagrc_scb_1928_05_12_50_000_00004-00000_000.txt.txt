Another beautiful memory was odd-
ed last night to the constantly grow-

formed the appropriate setting for the
fourteenth annual Men's Glee Club
concert. The walls of the chapel have
already echoed with many harmonies,
but none oi more direct appeal than
the varied melodies of last night’s
concert.- Nobody ever liked the music
that ”everybody likes” better than the
large audience which listened eagerly
to all three parts of the program.
