passed a plan to better the finnne
cial standing of Macy and Car-

dent, 10 per cent of every man's
social fee goes to the Council of

'House Presidents for operation

They may lead a dogs life. but
it's a good one! One of the most
attractive feminine members of
the Grinncll faculty, who doesn't
want her name mentioned, has
turned canine fancier, and now
owns two big dogs.

Having met the dogs personal-
ly, i can say that they’re good
dogs (And we like them.) Susie,
an lrish Setter pup, is as stream-
lined as a Zephyr, and as Lempel'e
amcntai as a race horse. Jock, a
Springer Spaniel, is the moie
solid and dependable type of ca-
iiine They are both show dogs.

Jock was named for the dog in
the play “Outward Bound," who
was always sitting in the win
dow.

Several days ago. Jock was sold
to a man living about five miles
west of Grinnell. One morning.
the woman uhose name we can’t
mention. got a phone call saying
that Jock had broken loose from
