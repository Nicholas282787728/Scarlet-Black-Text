aécept a 21 t0 7 defeat last'SatlIl‘daYv

HUME FRIDAY

Annual Clash Feature
of Day w Locals Out
for Big Victory.

IComing out of the hard Kansas Ag-
gie game with few injuries but a lot
of experience, the Pioneers' are well
primed for the Cornell game which
will be the big feature of the Crinnell
Homecoming this Friday. Last Sat-
urday the team played the best foot-
bell that they have shown so far this
season and considering the fact that
they were outweighed about fifteen
pounds to the man, they made a very
good showing and kept their heavier
opponents on their guard throughout
the game. if they play anything like
that brand of football against Cornell
they should have little trouble in dis-
posing of the Methodists.

The lineup will probably remain

unchanged excepting at-lcft end
