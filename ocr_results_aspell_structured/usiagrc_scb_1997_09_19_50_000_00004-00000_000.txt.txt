Wait a minute he graduated! .

BY LAUREN WOLFE
Staff Writer

Every year. the art department
chooses from a number of applir
cants one graduating art student to
stay for an extra semester at
Grinnell. After submitting a dozen
works and an essay on what he
would like to do with the time, Evan
Wilcox. ‘97, was granted the ninth
semester an fellowship.

“It's nice to be back in Grinnell."
he said. “I get to go to the Dari
Barn.” “

Wilcox is using this fellowship
to teach himself how to paint.
“That’s kind of the point of the
whole thing.” he said. Though the
felloWship is formally in painting,
Wilcox experiments with all kinds
of styles. especially collage and
mixed media.

This feels like an entirely differ
ent thing than I’m used to." Wilcox
said. “They pay me. and I don't pay
them.”

Wilcox believes this will be a
good experience. “They give you
enough to live on and free time for
your art, which is really hard to get.“

”The other thing the school gets
out ofit is getting me to do errands
for the profs, stufflike inventory and
cutting legs off tables,” he said.

The program has one require
ment: that Wilcox display his works
from this semester in a show at

ARTS & ENTERTAINMENT

Burling Library. “lt’sjust whatever
Ican do to [ill the walls." he said.

Currently lte's planning all art
sale in order to sell some of his
older works, “I'm still leamlng how
to paint, so lots of my old stuff

“The real process
of inspiration is
more intuitive. If I
tried to explain it,
it would just be a
rationalization [of
my work]. ”

doesn‘t appeal to mc, but maybe
it'll appeal to other people.”

‘Wllcox's work has been iniiUr
enced a great deal by the German
artistAnselm Kielcr. According to
Wilcox. Kiefer is a soil of artistic
historian. Until the collapse ofthe
former Soviet Union, he liOCllr
mentetl through his art the plight of
a divided Germany. “[His Work is]
about exercising demons and giv-
ing portents to the future."

Attention to all you Grinnellians
looking for something that is going
to make you think hard: look no fur-
ther. you‘ve found your movie. Par-
trait ofa lady is gotng to keep your
brain working overtime. and as
much as I hate to say it, in sort ofa'
good way.

My ﬁrst reaction to this ﬁlm by
Jane Campion (based on the novel
by Henry James) was. and I know
I’m going to burn in hell for this.
“chick ﬂick.” For lack of better ter-
minology, and I don‘t want to get into
the philosophy and debate behind
this, I‘m going to say that nothing
changed my reaction. In fact, over
time it was rather reinforced. I have
a feeling that the majority of males
aren’t going to find much for themr
selves in this movie The females
who viewed the movie at the same
time _I did however. found it very'
good. So. let's break it down.

Isabel (Nicole Kidman) is a
woman in 1872 Europe from
America who apparently is the best
thing since dairy products. Within
the ﬁrst halfhour ofthis two-and-a~

- half-hourbeast. she gets proposed to
umpteen billion times. Of course,

. Isabel is a 90's type gal who doesn't

: want to settle down and many a rich
boy. She is really spunky and likes
to be free of such things, and it‘s a
real disappointment when she 'falls
for a true jerk. Osmond (John
Malkovich), prompted by his evil
crone Madame Merle (Barbara
Hershey). Her spirit and will is bro-
ken by an evil man. along with any
character sympathy you might have
had up until that point.

Which brings me to my latest
complaint with Hollywood films.
There have been a slew of movxes
being made that really focus on por-

traying something, but what is often
forgotten in all the great shots and
spend effects and plot twtsts is to
build some sympathy between the
audience and at least some charac-
ter in the ﬁlm, For instance. I started
to have some sympathy for
Osmond’s daughter, but eventually
it was killed ilialiarslt manner, She's
not very interesting anyway, which I
suspect is linked to her belilg raised
by nuns (kind of like Tarzan. but
more boring, as Tony Parsons put it.)

Anyway, on to the good aspects
ofthe film. The costumes must have
cost a fortiinc. btit it‘s well worth the
look (Top hats, corsets and bustles,
oh my) The cinematography is su-
perb. except for all the weird slanted
angle shots that I could‘ncvcr ﬁgure
out. and some singing beans that
have been occurring over and over
in my dreams lately. The acting is
actually gteztt, despite the fact that
the dialogue borders on
Shakespearean In complexity, and
you get to see Shelly Duvall really
whacked out, which Iconsidcr to be
a bonus in any film. Oh. and did I
mention the weird black and white
shot of a nude Nicole Kidman? Be-
sides those things, you're going to
have to deal with a plot that is about
exciting as a tree stump, weirdjumps
in time, and ending so awful 1 was
screaming at the television. so‘me
editing that apparently cuts out some
important scenes. and the introducr
wry-credits with a lot of weird
women dancing around in a forest. I
still haven't ﬁgured that one out

The film gets 3 out 0H rejected
proposals. mostly because some
people are going to come looking
for "it: with a but ill give it anything
lower and lily head still hurts from
watching it. I guess I’m masochis-
tic.

can be done in a similar Way. or ap-
proached in a similar way even if
the end result is not the same," said
Wilcox.

Another major influence has
been the author Cormac McCarthy.
”1 don’t usually start projects think-
ing about visuals." he said. “I'm
more influenced by ideas.”

“He’s a brilliant, brilliant author.
I don’t know how I could read any
ofhis books and not be inspired. Be-
sides just dealing with American
myth and its culture and identity, his
works are basically...about how
miserable it is that everyone has to
walk around and be human, be mor»
tal and have to die.”

Turning these ideas into art is
“kind of a difﬁcult process," said
Wilcox.

He usually begins by brainstorm-
ing. How do these ideas connect?
What does he want to say about
them? Then he‘ll write up a pro-
posal for himself. outlining what he
thinks he’d like to do.

“Usually proposals like that just
end up being embarrassing later on
because you usuallyjust go offinto
something else when you start
working.”

Wilcox said most of the ideas that
originally provoke him to start a
project basically frame what it is
he’ll do. “The real process ofinspir
ration is more intuitive. If I tried to
explain it, it wouldjust be a ratio;
nalization [of my Work]."

Ideas and inspiration are fasci—
nating, said Wilcox, but they’re also
just not enough. “I don‘t think I
could work for eight hours a day in
painting sustained on just those
ideas." .

However, Wilcox doesn't really
plan on becoming a fullrtime painter
anyway. “It would be nice to be a
great American artist." he said. “I'd
earn money. But the problem with
that is you go and see the work that
you’ve already heard about three
dozen times. and you’ve already
been told this work is great and
wonderful, so you can’t go in and
approach it on your own terms.
From an artist's point of vtew, that’s
not very good.That’lljust get in the
way of what you’re trying to com-
municate."

What Wilcox would like to do
eventually is to graduate school,
“but for the moment I‘m gonna go
live somewhere like a real person
and see if] can’t work someplace
at the same time.”

Most jobs for young art majors
are computer-based. “Every little
business wants their own stylish
little web site,” said Wilcox. “Somer
thing like that Could be fun.”

But managing a full timejob and
balancing that with his own per»
sonal artistic pursuits could be
tough, he said. “It‘s not so easy to
pull a forty hour a weekjob and still
go home and paint."

And if none of this satisfies him?

“There's always flippin’
burgers."

Part two in an ongoing series
of KDIC Dee-Jay interviews

BY ANDREW ETTENHOFER

Last week I ititerwewed the very

have only

‘00 and

Preston
‘00.

AE: Tell me ﬁrst about your
show.

5?: It's called ”Sounds to Make
You Cry." It's every Tuesday from
1:00 pm to 2.00 pm. The basic
premise is just that — we want to
see if we can make people cry.

CMt It’s kind of like an experir
merit. We wanted to know if Vibratr
ing speakers can induce tears. So we
play a variety of music — and not
just depressing stuff — to test our
hypothesis.

BP: It’s a sociological experiment
with a touch of physics.

CM: So far, though, we have only
found that we make people angry.

BP: One guy told us we sucked.
But that‘s just one test subject. We
haven‘t got enough feedback to
know if anyone has cried yet. So we

strongly encourage our listeners to'

let us know their reactions.

AE'. Since this is your first ra-
dio show ever. I want to know
more about the'pmcess that led
you to KDIC. How did you guys
meet?

CM: We actually were long-time
childhood friends.

BP: Yeah. after spending 19 years
together in the belly 0le whale. you
really get to know the other person.

AE: And why did you guys want
to do a show?

CM: It’s a substitute for cocaine!

BP: Well.llikemusicandhe likes
to talk. I mean that's basically our
show. We are like two ordinary
roommates chatting. and itjust hape
pens that the whole student popular
tion is also listening to our banter.

AE: So tell me how the ﬁrst
show went.

CM: Well, it was certainly an ex
periment , an experiment on how
well we can use the equipment.

BP: On how well we care to use
the equipment...and how well we can
pick music.

CM: We played Frank Zappa.
Wesley Willis, and the Transform-
ers theme song,

8?: We weren’t as consistent as
we wanted to be.

CM: But. again. we haven’t got-
ten enough feedback to know for
sure. We just don’t know if anyone
cried. _

BP: We recorded the show and we
still need to the listen to the tape. But

really

show.
CM:
Ye all,
we are
s t i l I
there inside your radio even ifyou
turn it off!
- A_E: Are there any responsibiti.
ties to being a KDIC DJ?

BP: Not to steal the music up
there.

CM: And they (KDIC) makc itso
hard to doi I mean it's hell to be in
the studio and all the music is locked
up.
BP: Oh. another responsibility is
to drink lots of booze and smoke a
lot of cigarettes -especially if you
spill the stuff all over the console.

CM: They (KDIC) also want you
to urinate on the console.

AE: What other musical or me—
dia experience do you have?

CM: I came close to being a porn
star. My butt appeared on my home-
town news.

BP: Not only do we play music.
we also listen to music. We are also
the creators of music. We have a pot»
table studio and record a lot.

AE: And what can we expect
next week?

CM: [want to play the “Buy Re-
cycled” PSA. _

BP: We hope to be more
fluid...and have more fun because we
are pleasure mongers!

CM: We also want to explore the
possib es of the equipment up

- there, like broadcasting two differ-

ent songs simultaneously.

BP: Maybe we will even make our
own PSAs.

AE: What are the his! and worst
parts about being a KDIC DJ?

CM: Women....they're the worst
pan.
BP. It‘s too early to tell. We do
like these interviews. but we hate the
publicity.

AE: is there anything else you
want to tell the readers before we
conclude this interview?

CM: No. You got your interview!
Get off our backs!

BP: Piss off, beard guy!

want to be interviewed, vax me at
