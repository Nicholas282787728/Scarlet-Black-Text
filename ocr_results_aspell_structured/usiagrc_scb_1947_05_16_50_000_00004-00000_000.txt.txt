While engaging in a bit of
golf the other day, we achieved
several things . . . namelyafive

lost balls, a horrible sunburn. and . - ‘
lshup and a guaranteed annual,

a bushel of dandelions.
We dedicate the next seven.
days as Dandelion-Picking Week
all pastureenthusiasts have
found to their dismay that the
local course is infested, invaded,
and over-run by those little yel-
loiv plants, but no one does any-
thing about it. If each golfer
makes it a point to out one dan-
delion on each hole every time
he, or she, plays tbis.week, itV
would contribute to repelling the
invaders 'The fairways are too
far gone to help now, but at least‘
the greens could be improved.
Take along a knife and do a
little hacking next game, but

 

use that sarcalled finesse to safe-
guard- against any holes where.
the dainty little (naughty,
naughty) nuisances make their?
haven. l

Latest rumor to ﬂoat over the
campus has it that a Professor in
Economics (Labor that is) has
accepted a baseball contract for
this summer, only hitcl-i thus far
seems to be the contract-terms
. said Prof. demands a closed

wage for the remainder of his
life. Look for him in the lineup
come June tho, for collective bar-
gaining will bring obout a final
settlement.

Tex Kaufmann performed like
a true champion against the

letngan softball Leamvin the title

but tore off the metacarpals ofl

Tex‘s pitching hand, yet he oon-
tinued and pitched Dibble to VIC'
tory.

Golf

Golfer of the season seems to
be Dave Holman. This sun-kissed
lad is a trifle erratic though . . .
having posted scores ranging
from so to 105, depending upon
which foot he kicks the ball with,
or which arm he uses for a hand-
mosliie. Here’s to more and better
results, Dave!

Dibble is hard at work deter-
ming an intramural golf team
for the coming tournament. Lang-
an is also rumored to be grooms
ing a squad of par-busters, but
Rawson (with Sky Baker lapping
the field) will be tough contends
