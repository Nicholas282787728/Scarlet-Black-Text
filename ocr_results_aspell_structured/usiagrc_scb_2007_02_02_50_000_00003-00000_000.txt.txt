Joint Board tabled the bill as a whole, due

[is] to bridge the gap between the President
and the students,”said Billups.

But Lienneman saw this role as too ambigs
uous. “They're describing it as a catcheall po-
sition," she said. “I don’t want my president to
be a catchall." She argued door-knocking and
other direct interactions with student was best

Brendan Baker ’06 and Vice President Chris
Ochoa'Oé. Licnncman,who was dating Ochoa
at the time,joined in this opposition.
Members of the committee last semester
chose to divide these two questions. While
the debate over the role of Concerts and Films
died in Joint Board, SGA unanimously voted

reserved for senators.
Last year, President
John Bohman ’06 sent
the proposal to the
SGA reform commit-
tee, where they com»
bined two ideas in one
bill. In addition to a
new VicesPresident,
who would take over
many of the President’s
duties on committees,

the bill also removed Concerts and Films com-
mittee chairs from their positions at chiics»

to amend its bylaws and create
a second Vicerpl‘osidcnt.
Because the bylaws were
already amended, this new
amendment sewed only to
create election policy for the
position and adjust constitu-
tionnl syntax. Had the nmcnd-
merit failed, SGA members
would not have a clear course
of action. “We have no prev
edent for a bylaw being ap

proved and passed and the amendment fail—
ing," said Nick Blencowe ’08, Administrative

While the amendment had enormous
ramifications Within SGA, few students knew
about it. Except for a poorly attended SGA
and student Campaign for Increased Political
Engagement (SCIPE) forum, there was little
effort to educate the campus on the issue.

It was only after Lienneman postered the
campus that SGA mounted a campaign to in
foim students. “I don't think anyone expected
to have to advertise,” said Student Services
Coordinator Julie Edwards who is a member
of Election Board.

Blencowe, anothcr member of Election
Board, chose not to advertise in a neutral
manner for fear that it would “numb"studenrs
to the senatorial elections. He later worried
that in doing this, not enough students would
be informed. “I still feel like we didn‘t do
enough," he said.

Billups concurred. uSGA failed to talk
about [the amendment] last semesterwlien we
had time for it," he said.

SGA officials did not think most students
would be interested. “What we’ve found in

ing its policy of need-blind
admissions, and also meeting
100 percent of demonstrated
need. Only thirteen other
institutions in the nation
implement versions of both
ofthese policies.
Additionally, for the first
time, the college plans to
index merit aid. Previously,
students receiving merit
scholarships, which do not
increase, were forced to
cope with tuition increases
without corresponding help
from the institution. Under
the new plan, merit aid will

increase in proportion to
tuition increases.

With many dependent
on ﬁnancial aid, the hike
has generated controversy
Students, in particular, res
sponded With skepticism
and confusion given the
considerable ﬁnancial re—
sources available to an in-
stitution with :i 51.4 billion
endowment. “We have such
a huge endowment," said
Haley. “[This hike] is just
not necessary or essential."

Administrators respond
to such criticism by point—
ing out that the college‘s

cost, despite its consider-
able resources, for outpaces
its revenues. According to
surnncr, Grinnell spends
nearly $80,000 each year
per student, for more than
it currently makes in tut
ition revenueTrustees often
mention that the school is
too dependent on its en-
dowment, the interest from
which accounts for nearly
50% ofthe school’s operate
ing budget.

According to Sumner,
this is in part because so
many students are on finan-
cial aid. “Our nettuition rev-

enue is not so great because
90% of our students have
ﬁnancial aid,” said Sumnei,
“and they have it in hugely
suhstantialainounts.”
Grinnell's revenues are
further attenuated as the
school also receives much
less from gifts and grants
than peer institutions. “The
trustees have been anxious
to...genemte more gifts and
grants, and more net tuition
rcvcnucs,"said Sumner. The
school's alumni giving rate is
a low 37% and many alumni
who do donate cannot give
as much as they would like.

Passed amendments

I. . CND SenatorAddition

Initially proposed by CND Senator Justin Abramson,
the amendment increases the number of senators for the
CND cluster from three to two. With the completion of
the Cowles apartments, the CND duster will add 45 new
beds and bring its total to the same level of LooseHead
and East clusters both of which have three senato . . -

the past is that students don’t care at all about
SGA reform," said Blencowe.

But at least one student did care. After
a conversation with Lienneman, SGA Vice
President Michael Billups '07 knew her ope
position.

“I could see in her eye at that moment that
she [didn't like the amciidment],”he said. “But
Ididn’t realize she'd become a one woman army
and pursue it as forcefully as she [did]."

Others were upset by some of her posters'
allegations. “Some of her posters described
Cabinet as inefficient,”said Edwards. “I think
that is unnecessary."

Though the amendment passed, Lit
cnncmrm was reelected to Joint Board and
will continuc to agitate for reform. she said.“lf
there are tensions, I’m not going to let it scare
me away.”

Because the amendment includes a sun-
set clausc, Joint Board will reevaluate the new
position at the end of next year. "Pass or don’t
pass we will have to have a dialogue," said
Blcncowe.
