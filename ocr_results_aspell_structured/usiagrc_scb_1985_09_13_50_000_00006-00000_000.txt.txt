The second workshop focuses on the ac-
tual use at the computer. A student User
Consultant teaches this workshop, pro-
viding a low tension atmosphere (or
students new to computing.

The students are taught how to word pro-
cess. send electronic mail, and even how to
make a term paper appear longer than it
really is. Students are encouraged to use
experimentation an the computer in order
to familiarize themselves with the Various
commands.

Most-academic computing at‘Grinnell
takes place on the PDP 11/70 timersharing
computer. Although the technology of the
PDP is litteen to twenty years old, its large
timersharing capabilities and its tradir
tional use at Grinnell make the PDP a very
busy computer. However. the PDP will be
eventually phased out as the college’s new
VAX 3600 comes on later this fall.

The new vax will have many more
capabilities than the PDP, as well as have
ing lour times its speed. Computer Ser
vices is also building up a large number oi
stand-alone microcomputers at many
places throughout the campus in order to
meet the need [or word processing.

In fact Moberg sees the acquisition of
these microcomputers as the primary im-
provement of the system over last year.

Although Grinnell does not have a Come

~puter Science major, Moberg believes the

theoretical work done through the
mathematics major provides a solid base
for graduate studies in computers (the 001*
lege does otter an interdisciplinary con-
centration on Computer Studies).

Moberg emphasizes that computer
science is not “just programming," butrer
quires “good problem solvers good con-
sultants and people skilled In human rela-
trons”

As an example or the success of com-
puting at crinnell, Moberg mentioned that
five students worked Over the summer,
These students updated programs and
documentations for Computer Services.
Mobcrg expressed satisfaction in his
Grinnellrtrained employees. He also
pointed out that the last two computer
analysts hired by Computer Services have
been Grinnell graduates.
