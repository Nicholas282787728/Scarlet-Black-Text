Lounge renovations
following schedule

by Jessica Weisel

As part of the series of
renovations of campus buildings,
the Housing Committee has ap-
proved plans to renovate dorm
lounges at a rate of two per
summer. The plan involves ren-
ovating one lounge on both
North and South Campus to
make them more attractive as
well as more capable of with
standing student use.

“Lounges will not follow the
same hall schedule" that the
trustees set, said Diane
Dougherty, the director of student
housing, “We will be upgrading
lounges quicker." The trustees
have allocated funds for the reno—
vation of one dorm each summer.
The dorms will be renovated ac—
cording to the schedule followed
during previous renovations.

Haines and Smith have been
selected as the first halls to have
their lounges remodeled. The
renovations will include an up»
grading of the furniture, lights,
paint, and floor. Dougherty said
that The Housing Committee
“would like to capitalize on the
positive aspects of the lounges

while allowing the Physical
Plant to maintain them." One
aspect that she emphasized was
the restoration of the original
wood floors in many of the
lounges. She explained that car-
pet has been mounted over wood
in many halls, but returning to
wood would be more attractive.
Wood may also be cleaned more
easily by Physical Plant staff.

As well as restoring the wood
floors, the Housing Committee
has recommended the purchase of
more durable furniture. Accord-
ing to Dougherty, the furniture
currently in tlic lounges is resi-
dential furniture and is not strong
enough for lounge use. She said,
“We‘ll put forth money to restore
lounges and make them more at-
tractive, but also to make them
capable of handling more peo-
pic."

The furniture being considered
is more formal than the furniture
now in most of the lounges.
Daugherty explained that the
renovated lounges “may have the
appearance of a Main Lounge.”
