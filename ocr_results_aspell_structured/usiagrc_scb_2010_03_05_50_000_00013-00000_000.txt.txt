BY SowMoN MILLER .

The Mens Tennis team (e2) picked up two wins and a loss
this weekend, beating Wartburg College and the University ofWis-
Consiana Crosse Saturday at Warrburg and losing at Carleton on
Sunday. Head Coach Andrew Hamiltonwas happywith the team’s
play and result,

“VVe had whatl would considera pretty keyvictory against Unir
versiry ofWisconsin-La Ctosse," Hamilton said. “Even though we
lost to [Carleton],1 moughtwc played a pretty good match.”

Despite their success,]unior Captain Juan Carlos Perez ’11 still
thinks that therewas a lot of room for improvement over the week
end.

”Last year, we would beat these teams pretty handily, and this
year we had to ﬁght a lot," Perez said. “Last weekend was a
experience and we learned from it, and now we’re going to show up
as ifwe’re playing a ranked team every time."

The team lost three of last years starters including their star don—
bles teal-n, Dan LaFountaine ’09 and Nate Fox '09, who ended their
Ganndl careers in the quarreriinais of last years National NCAA
Division III tournament.

“Last years' team was the highest achieving meris team in the
modern era at Grinnell," Hamilton said. “Every year is diherent. ..
we need to be focused on what's at hand this year."

The Pioneers want to continue their success and that means
another Midwest Conference Championship. According to Coach
Hamilton, Gririnell has Won the title for six straight years and seven
of the last eight.

Perez spearheads their effort. as the No. 1 singles player and,
along with Martin Dluhos '12, on the No. 1 doubles team.As such,
he has played some key matches already this year, including against
Carleton's top singles player, the 12th ranked player in the region.

No match, however, was as big for Perez as his near triumph
over NAIA 5th ranked nationally Remy Caﬁ’ardo ﬁom Graceland.

“Remy last year killed me. Absolutely killed me. it vim: 5-0 5-2,
and I didn’t even have a chance," Perez said. "This year, I've been
working really hard. .1 feel like I’m playing the best tennis of my
life, so I felt like I had a better shot ofheacing him this year. I was
not afraid."

Perez played Caﬁardo close, eventually falling +6 75 5-4. As
a captain and as one of the team’s veterans, Perez is picking up more
responsibility offtl-ie court as well.

“I was used to just following my leaders. My captains would tell
me what to do and how to do it,” Perez said. ”This year. . .I'm one
of the ones who has to come up with what to do and how to solve
problems and how to recommend some things to Coa

Joining the team this year will be three ﬁrst years, including ls-
han Bhadkamkar ’13, who plays both singles and doubles. Bhad—
kamkar appredates how much the team welcomed him and his
fellow ﬁeshmen.

“One of the amazing things about our team is that we have
incredible camaraderie, that you doni really ﬁnd on a lot of other

college tearns,"Bhadlranrkar said. “You’ll find the guys doing home-
work together, eau'ng dimer together. Even when we weren’t in sea-
son we spent a lot ofcime together."

According to Bhadkamkar, this translates to improvement on
the court.

“VVe’re making each other better,"Bhadkaml<at said.

“My hope is for us to continue to he focused on the singles court
and to have the players individually continue to develop their play-
ing styles," Hamilton said. “As a team one of our main concepts over
the next couple ofweeks is to get better at doubles."

To this end, coach Hamilton plans to adjust the 2nd and 3rd
doubles teams and test their process over the next few games. He
hopes to see improvement by spring Break, when the team will face
a sand of highly rated opponents on the road, including Luther,
University ofWisconsianhitewater, and the University ofChicar
go—a top 15 turn nationally. Perez sees the Spring Break trip as a

measure of the team.

"During the Spring Break mp we’re going to be playing a couple
ranked teams,” Perez said. ‘We're going to be able to evaluate our
standing."

Coach Hamilton hopes that this tough schedule will prepare the
players for inrootiference matches in April

”We deﬁnitely will be trying to get our level up so that when we
play those conference opponents... we'll be playing our best," Ham-
ilton said.

These matches include the ﬁrst home match of the year, which
doesn’t come eiilApi-il 17 against Coe College.

“I’m hoping that we can get as much fan support as possible for
our 4 home matches inApril,"Bhadkaml<ar said.

The team’s next game is 11:00 am. tomonow at St. Ambrose

Track and Field finish indoor season, ready for sun

Ev RON CHlU

The Grinnell Men’s and Women’s Track
team finished the indoor season with opti-
mism by taking sixth place with 60 points
and ninth place with 15 points respectively
at the Midwest Conference Indoor Chamr
pionships last weekend in Galesburg, 111.

“Our team did pretty well. We had a lot
of personal bests and some top 10 ﬁnishes
all time for our team," Kyle Lynch~Klarup
'10 said. “Our sprinting team did quite well
and out 4x2 team was fantastic."

Both teams beneﬁted from stellar indie
vidual and relay efforts. For the men, David
Montgomery'lo secured both the 3000 and
5000 meter run titles. On the women’s side,
the Pioneers took fourth place in a distance
medley while Hannah colter '12 picked up
seventh place in the 5000 meter run. The
men’s team enjoys versatility within the
team that it has not enjoyed before.

“This year, we have several strong
points. our sprinting program has really
taken off," Lynch-Klarup said. “We have
great hurdlers and 200m and 100m runners
are doing really well with Mike Martinez
and Winnon Brunson. Our distance crowd
is getting stronger, led by Dan Krauss and
David Montgomery."

Coach Will Freeman noticed the im-
proved performance from all across the

team, noting how some people who have
been in the program have matured their
abilities.

“[We are] much more balanced," Freer
man said. “We're going to he scoring a lot
of points from field events, from jumps,
throws, hurdles and sprints. We’re going to
get points from all ofthe groups."

The men’s team performed well in spite
of several injuries to important contribur
tors.

“We were missing some key people
that could have given us some points," said
Montgomery. Freeman noted that team-
mates Dan Krauss ’12 and Mike Galla-
gher ’10 were among the crucial losses to
the team last weekend. Lynch-Klarup was
injured after the first day of competition.
Despite these injuries, team members re-
mained hopeful for the prospects of the
outdoor season.

"We've been having a lot ofinjuries but
somebody else always steps up," said Scott
Phillips ’10.

Coach Freeman said that the indoor
season had more priorities in staying
healthy and avoiding long term injuries
while building up strength for the outdoor
season,

“The smart thing was to hold them out
because of injuries that could have poten»

tially created problems for the outdoor sea-
son," Freeman said.

The women's team this year has a con-
siderably smaller roster than most teams
both in the past and compared to other
teams this year. With many women on
study abroad programs this semester, the
team has had difficulty being competitive
across all the events.

“More people have to be accountable
for performing at practice because we have
a smaller team,"Colter said. “It can be hard
sometimes because more numbers means a
larger pool to earn points.”

Despite the numerical disadvantage,
team members remained optimistic about
overcoming this particular challenge.

“In terms of team score, we did not
score really highly," Sachi Graber '12 said.
“People did really well on an individual
level and we're pulling together. It's defi-
nitely advantageous to have more people as
a team, but we're making it work and we’re
also getting a chance to be closer."

In addition to battling injuries and ﬁll’
ing the roster, both teams also encountered
difﬁculties in training indoors with the
College's current facilities. The current in-
door traclr at the PEC offers limited train-
ing opportunities for the team.

“Our team tries to not run on the sur

face of the track because it causes injuries.
So we're limited to running on suppler
mentary mats on one lane," said Lynchr
Klarup.

'We'rc competing against a lot of
schools that have good indoor facilities
while we don’t,” Montgomery said. “It's al—
ways been hindering."

Coach Freeman expressed additional
difﬁculties in starting the indoor season
four weeks. later than most teams, offer-
ing less preparation for the MWC indoor
Conference Championship. However,
Freeman reiterated the importance ofstay—
ing healthy for the outdoor season.

"We're a top three team outdoors when
we're healthy. I’d like to see us Top Three,”
Freeman said. “It’s a realistic goal and we
have the people to do it. People need to be
healthy to do it.”

The general feeling is that the team has
all the pieces together for a highly success
ful outdoor season. As the warmer weather
rolls in, the team hopes to truly shine.

“We really feel we have great poten-
tial for this team outdoors," Freeman said.
“We're pointing for the second weekend
of May and hopefully we will all come (Or
gether."
