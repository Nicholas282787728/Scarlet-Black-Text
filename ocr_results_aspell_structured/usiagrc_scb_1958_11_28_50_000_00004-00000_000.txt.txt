Swimmers Prepare
For First Meet;
“No Weak Spots"

Grinnell‘s swimming team,
coached .by lrv Simone, is well
into its fourth week of practice
in preparation for the season
that will open Saturday, Dec. 6.
The squad includes Six sopho-
mores, iive iuniors and three
seniors.

simone tabs this aggrega—

tion as potentially the finest
to represent the Pioneers in a
pool for some time. He points
out that while Grinnell has
few individual stars, all 14
men can turn in a more than
capable performance. There
are no weak spots on the
team, and every event is filled
by two or more strong swim-
mers.

By events, the team member;
are: Art Johnson and Tom Du<
hols, backstroke; Jim Jacobson
and Buddy Frank, butterfly;
Bill Murray and Bill Hendrey,
distance freestyle: Bob Grindey
and Doug Kirchner, breast~
stroke; and five freestyle sprint-
ers, Stan Norman, Dick Bresna-
han, Pete Lysne, Jack Eiel and
Bob Rikkers. George Keith does
the diving, with support from
Bresnahan.

As tohow the team will
fare, this season, Simone
would not comment other than
to say that the holes opened
by graduation had been more
than filled by his sophomore
contingent and that the team
was in excellent shape, having
already turned in practice
times which compared favor~
ably with conference records.

The coach did caution, how-
ever, that other league teams
were reputed also to have added
strength since last year. The
Dec. 6 meet, a triangular against
Lawrence and Cornell at Grins
nell, could very well tell the
story. Lawrence comes to the
campus with the conference
breaststroke and backstroke
champions and Cornell has one
of the finest hreaststrckers
around. In any ease both teams
are rated as very strong this
Year and will test the Pioneers
right at the start.

This meet will be followed
by a trip to the Knox Relays
on Dec. 13, and then there
will be no more meets in this
area until after Christmas'va-
cation.

Today from 4 to B p.m. a
swimming clinic was to be held.
It featured the Grinnell swim-
ming team in an intro-squad
meet and demonstrations of all
types of strokes and turns, dives

and other skills.

The 1953 IM swimming meet
will be held tomorrow, begin—
ning at 3 p.m. The races will
be held in heats, and the wine
hers will be determined on a
comparative time basis. Cowlcs

was the surprise winner of last
year‘s meet and will be a strong
contender to repeat this year.

Cowles jumped to the lead in
the 1M volleyball league by de-
feating South Younker, ﬁve
games to one, dropping them
into the second slot. Cowles’
season record to date is 23—7,
and South has a 27—9 mark. The
season is past the half-way
point, and the race is narrow-
ing clown to three halls: Cowles,
South and Clark. Cowles and
Clark have seven losses,
South has lost nine,

ball, lowa was, until that Sature
day, the undefeated conference
champion.

Not 25 miles distant in Co»
dar Rapids, at the same hour,
Coe college, Midwest Confer.
ence champion and unbeaten
in elevcn games, was upset by
Grinnell before some so Pin»
ncer fans. One was, until Sat-
urday, the undefeated confer
cnce champion. That game
took place in Kingston Stad<
iuin, where on the same turf
the day before, the Buckeyes
had polished their heels to
fleet past Iowa the next day.
Like lcwa, Coe’s season had
seen seine close wins, but nev—
ertheless. they had won. Like
Ohio state, Grinnell had become
a disappointment to themselves,
their followers and maybe even
their coach! I sat in the mist
and cold in lowa City, in a seat
a few million TV viewers would
have scalped tickets for. How I
wish I’d been sitting in one of
a thousand empty seats in Ce-
dar Rapids, watching the Pio-
neers hang one on Coe that no
one there will ever forget.

To Coc that must have been a
mythical afternoon, stopped by
resistance unexpected and met
with a force too tough to de
fend. To Grinnell, this was what
they’d practiced, planned and
sweated for all season, only once
getting the job done.

Two months ago a lot of
fans, myself included, felt as
did the coaches and players
that this team had the stuff.
if it could just “jail." But
Grinnell didn't: jell all season,
as we saw week by week.

This got tough on players,
tougher yet for coaches, and
fans got thinner, and excuses
got poorer. The Mondays after
Saturday get colder and sorer.

I thought Grinnell would be
lucky to finish within three
touchdowns Saturday after fol~
lowing the conference season
and reading about ,cde's 13
stonewalied seniors. But I got

fooled, and you got fooled an.

Coe got beat; the hardest heat
ing they ever had to take an
one they‘ll still be wonderin_
about next fall when they com-
to Grinnell.

But: Grinneil‘s coaches and
players didn’t get fooled. They
just used the stuff they‘d
learned as a team. The stuff
most oi us had lost faith in.
This was the most earned vlc
tcry that any coach or playe
or any Grinnell team in histor
could ever earn, even back t-
1889. No Grinnell tcam coul-
better be prouder than this one
As a past player I know this
For now, all of you at Grinnel
and hundreds of we others ca
come out of our corners an.
raise again the “Spirit of Grin
nell.” It should be a lesson n-
Grinnellian ever forgets,

With no Rose Bowls, no vic
tory banquets, no packed stad
iums, T.V. or broad headline
this was the upset of the na
tion. Just plain guts, faith in .
goal not reached, and determin
atian of these players an-
coaches against all odds mad
the team a real champion.
