We're Over The Top - -

The ringing of the chapel bell Tuesday
morning announced to us, the students and
faculty of Grinnell College, that we had gone
over the top in our drive to raise money
for the World Student Service Fund.

No tangible reward will be given us fol
having contributed so generously and
“hole-heartedly to this fund. But we knew
that before we gave! Ours is a true satisV
faction, derived from the knowledge that
many imprisoned boys will benefit from
our donations. Each of us has helped some
lad, less fortunate than ourselves, to con
tinue his education, Not because we had
toibecause we wanted to. We realize full
well that those of us in college are the
“pi" ileged few,” especially now. By this
magnificent gesture Grinnellians have
proved beyond a doubt that they recognize
the importance and material value of edu-
cation.

It makes one have faith in humanity to
consider the results of this drive. We may
be a small college, but size has not hindered
our might. The World Student Service
Fund drive is the supreme evidence of the
justification of America's educational phil-
osophy. Thanks, Grinnellians.

l Try, Try Again - -

l Perhaps they serve who only sit and write.
lIn that hope, we reopen the que'tion of
comprehensivcs and course examinations.

Mention is made of the slackening of
student el'iO't in general Class wolli ii'
course examinations are not required. Yet
for yeal'siwell, long enough to become a

adition anyway—the expedient of reqllir
mg 21 'B' average in courses outside one’s
major field sufficed. Why was the system
changed? All we want is all answer.

Secondly, this year 01' all years, with
winter comprehensive-s scheduled immedir
ately after a vacation, and sanduiched in
with lduating' festivities and course ch
aminations too—all within a maximum of
3 weeks and perhaps lessimay we point
out that any slackening in general class
work will not be attributable to only a pre-
sumptive sense of security resulting from
having passed comps.

For those many students who will be
taking comprehensives iii the spring, yet
another argument can be advanced. Ac-
cording to campus rumor, those comprehenr
sives will be given shortlyivei'y shortlyi
after spring recess. Let us face facts and
realize that people just don’t study during
vacations. Let us face facts and recognize
that many students cannot go to their
homes for so short a period, and hence will
be descending upn Aunt Letitia in Daven—
port for the weekkthere is something has
ically contradictory about being a house-
guest and a student simultaneously. Let
us face facts and realize that seniors in the
May class will know, almost a month be-
fore graduation whether they have sucess-
fully cleared THE big obstacle which stands
between them and a diploma, and having
jumped over comprehensives they don’t
particularly care if they bump a toe on a
class mark. Let us face the fact that the
faculty itself would hardly refuse a diploma
to one who did well in comprehensives and
slipped on a course grade. Or would the
faculty be so humanely inclined?

We ask, hopefully, again, and with an
attempt at Miltonian patience, we await
your answer.
