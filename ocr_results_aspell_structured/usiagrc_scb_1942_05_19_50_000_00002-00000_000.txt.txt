O The New Majors.

The announcement of three new majors for
Grinnell students signifies the beginning of
a new period in the college’s development
It may be taken as an indication of future
moves which will further facilitate the se—
lection of a “personalized major” for every
upperclass student. As such it should be
welcomed by that group of students who
have found the deparmentalized major 21 re-
stricting one.

Specifically, this plan will allow a stu-
dent to cut across departmental divisions
and to combine those courses from sev-
eral departments which for his particular
needs will provide a well-balanced and
comprehensive field of study.

For the time being at least, it must be
remembered that the addition of these new
majors in no way replaces or nllllifies the
regular depaltmental scheme of majors. Up
perclass students may continue to confine

Praised for Weekend Concerts

Last weekend was highlighted

their course of study to one department if
they choose. Likewise, it does not excuse any
student from the general distribution re-
quirements set up by the college. It effects,
in essence, only upperclass students choos-
ing their major field.

But for those students it is a happy solu-
tion to one of Grinnell’s oldest problems. It
will have immediate effect for some who
have been attempting to combine the very
courses treated by the new majors. It may
have an even wider effect if the plan is
expanded in the future, and Grinnell stu-
dents are eventually able to work out, with
their advisers, an individual and personally
satisfactory major.

O The Old Order.

“The old order changeth, yielding to the
new.” These familiar lines of Tennyson are
most appropriate for students at Grillnell
this year. For with the retirement of Miss
Lowden, Mr. Lavell, Mr. Stoops and Mr.
Wittler, another milestone in the history of
Grinnell College has been reached.

The greatness of Grinnell has been built
upon the achievements of such leaders as
these. P cognized throughout the country
[or their scholarly work, they have still
found time to make countless student
f endships and contribute to the “greater”
Grinnell.

Students ill the future will miss the
gentle humor of Mr. Lavell and Mr. Whitt—
ler‘s inevitable smile and cheerful greeting.
No longer will the digniﬁed Ml: Stoops, with
personable Cheetah trailing behind, be seen
strolling around the campus at twilighti
eager for a chat with one and all. Miss
Lowden’s ready smile and sparkling wit will
no longer grace our classrooms

It is hard to say goodby to these friendly
and inspirational teachers it is comforting
to realize that their contributions will live
on in the spirit and traditions of Grinnell
that they symbolize.

1,, Due Wednesday

with two delightful concerLs by
two Grinnell college musical ‘or—
genizaiicns.

On Friday night the Men's
Glee club, under the direction of
J, Forrest West, presented its
forty—eighth annual home concert,
and Sunday afternoon the Cen-
tral Iowa Symphony, conducted
by Glenn D. Swan, played its final
concert of me season,

Peck Soloist.

David E, Peck, concentmestcr
and professor of violin, was solo-
ist at the Sunday concert, and
his performance of Bruch’s “Can-
certo for Violin in G Minor" de-
serves much praise as is truly an-
tistic feat.

Women Soloists.

The Glee club concert also fea-
tured two members of the Woe
men's Glee club besides me of its
own members as soloists. Miss
Jean Bates, Soprano, sang Mas-
Sol-let’s “Gavotte, from Manon"
with a» beautiful vocal quality,
while Miss Barbara McMurrcy,
comralto, in singing “Habanera,
from Carmen" by Bizet, displayed
is fine effect in the answering
back and forth with the chorus.

Gerald Vandenberg, bal‘itﬂne,
sang with an excellent full tone
Gounod‘s ”Le Veau D'Ol‘, from
Faust.”

“Ill-17. and West Perform.

Also outstanding on the pro-
gram were the performances of
Warren J. VVirtZ at the piano,
and West who sang the power—
fully phrased “Credo, from Otelr
lo" by Verdi.

Orchestra Well Received.

The orchestra concert, although
poorly attended because of adver»
se weather conditions, by a much
smaller audience than the Glee

club’s full house, was equally well
received however.

Played most effectively was the
dynamic fantasy overture, “Rus-
sian Easter” by Rimskerol‘sa-
kcff, although Arensky’s mcicdic
“Variations on a theme by Tsch-
alkowsky” were performed most
beautifully by the strings.

A unique feature of the concert
was an explanation by Swen of
the Various motifs or themes of
Mendelssohn's “lnnglc's Cave Ov-
el‘ture” and of the "Russian
Easter Overture."

0n the Whole both musical
groups were very successful. They
were well balanced and had a
fine blending of tone. The en-
thusiastic reception by their re-
spective audiences only served to
confirm this critic’s impression
that a supurb job of conducting
was done by both West and Swan.

He added that although the
Cadahouts realize the college's
point of view, the club is essen-
tially designed for students, and
as such, should be permitted to
charge outsiders a nominal fee
for its social activities.

This does not mean that 'the

that he hoped to smooth things
out through talks with adminis-

He announced that in event the
