Next year’s juniors fight
for off-campus privileges

ANDY WIEDNER
STAFF WRITER

The off—campus situation has
become very sensitive this year with
the exttzrlarge class oi 1997 iinally
making its way to the top of the
onnnell pecking order. Originally,
there were 165 spots available foroff»
campus living next year and because
more than 165 seniors applied, no
,uniors were to be able to escape Me
in a dorm. But, due to the efforts of
two members of the class of‘98, pos—
sibly as many as 28 juniors will be
allowed to live ol‘ﬂcampus.

Emily Davis and Elise Piannenr
stiel. two soon<to<be iuniors both
had signed leases on apartments iot
the coming year and were hottiiied

to find out that they might not be
able to live off/campus Both knew
that many others had also signed
leases and would be equally outraged
so they decided to see what could be
done to change the situation.

Afterdiscussing the matter with
DeanforStudentAffaitsTolnCrady
and Housing Director Oda Callison
to see what could be clone, szlnncn»
stiel and Davis decided to see how
much support for their position they
could muster up on campus. With a
hastily organized campaign, the two
collected 525 signatures on a pcti.
tion during one dinner alone and
over 52 emails from ,uniors who
would be aiiected adversely by the
situation

Armed with their petition and

thcemail responses, Ffannenstiel and
Davis once again talked to Crady
and got permission ior at least 13
juniors to live offecampus with a pos«
sibility (or 15 more spots. Davis and
Piannenstiel are happy with even
the small number of spots because
“it's alot better than :ero" but still
ieel that thecollege maybe inadvert—
ently misled manystudents, through
it‘srectuitment literature, into think
ing that they would, almost as a mat«
ter of course, be able to live off—
campus with claims that almost all
juniors and seniors who want to will
be able to live off—campus. Dams and
Pfannenstiel took the effort to lobby
(or the extra spots for Juniors “be«
cause ,uniors also have valid reasons
to live off-campus ”
