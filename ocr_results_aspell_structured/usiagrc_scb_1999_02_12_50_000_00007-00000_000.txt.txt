The WEEK:
Carlos Macias

BY SARAH LIEBMAN
Staff Writer

Carlos Macias is warm and ins
ful, a realist who possesses genuine
optimism.

Macias will behappy in May when

he graduates with a major in Psychol»
ogy. ,
“I didn't think 1 was going to make
it," he said. He'd seen friends leave
Grinnell. For him, attending Grinnell
meant leaving his community Kilt he
feels he can use his education to help
his community.

This summer, he and Beniamin
Rodriguez worked with a Des Moines
nonprofit group to provide leadership
training in a work environment to at.
risk Latinos. _ ‘

Macias expressed concern that the
Des Moincs Latino population is of—
ten ignored and the school system
doesn't have resources to help these
students. His program provided are
students with role models and in turn

"dieythemsclvcs become role models."
Aftergraduation, Macias hopes to
return to California and wo‘rk in a His-
panic organization for rwo years he—
.. fore going in grad school.
While here at crinnell, Macias
. became very active. He described
Grinnell as “a great college, but there
is something missing” making it “very
dimcult for multicultural students to
cope here."

He is pleased with how
multicultural students band together.
“it brings you closer to your roots to
be army from them," he explained. Ar
Grinnell he has formed friendships
“stronger than anything [he] could
imagine before.“

last year Macias served as presi-
dent ofSOL, senator, and member of

the space committee. He found it
very hard to he one of just two
multicultural senators trying to rep-
resenr 25 percent ofthe student body.
When he went abroad to Mexico last
semester and was not allowed to join
political organizations because he was
an international student, he found
it odd not to be as involved in the
community as he was at Grinnell.

While raking a Full course load,
serving as SOL presidenr, senator,
and a member ofthe space commit»
tee, Macias worked 2550 hours a
week. However, he claims this is a
normal load.

Noting that a higher percentage
of multicultural students work at
cowles and Harris, he realized rhar
often these students, due to finan-

Now, in his last semester, Macias sees
that because he attends crinnell, he has
privilege. “I have to learn to wield it re—
sponsibly," he said. While he hopes to
use his education to help his commu—
nity, he wonders “does that mean I’m
whitewashing my community?”

At Grinnell, Macias feels he has
learned to empower himself. He believes
that while the college 'should provide

Macias would like to wish the

lfyou’re reading this, it means that
for some reason, an article about
Valentine's Day caught your eye.
Whyi

Did you think it might offer tips
on how to “snag a sweetie"? Maybe
you already have someone in mind,
and hopefully, you are in his or her’s.

But let's switch the focus from the
recent media hype, bombarding us
with sex, candy and cheapcheapcheap
diamond engagement bracelets.

Valentine’s Day, unlike other “mar
jot" holidays, doesn’t necessarily affcct
everyone, or even a large portion in a
pleasant way.

' Its a subyectivc experience depend-
ing on the obvious variable—do you
have a signingant other?

our ofrwelve Grinnellians, picked
entirely at random from the student
directory, only two had signiﬁgant oth-
ers to speak of, with whom they were
planningto spend rhisvalenrine's Day

The other ten, a couple ofwhorn
asked how the hell I knew they didn’t
have anyone in particular, gave an in
tcresting mix of responses when asked,
what their plans/feelings were about
Valentines Day.

Several students merely said they
were going to do what they always do
on the weekends, regardless ofthe Day.

"‘l’m all for love," said John Actnl
.01 “but it’s no biggie ifyou don't have
someone."

Ben Blchm ‘02 agreed, saying “I
don't plan to do anything special.”

One student, Christopher Freer
man '99 didn’t express any bad {cel-
ings towards valentine's Day, but
wasn’t particularly excited. “It’s an-
other day. I'm not going to go out
and picket people buying chocolate:
or anything," he said.

KimSmith ‘02had the samcidea
in mind, “Same old, same old. it
doesn’t bother me too mudi. The
singingvalentinesarekind ofannoy-
ing..."

still, somepeople make special
plans even ifthey don’tincludealovc
interest.

"l’m actually really dieetiul about
it this year, its a day you can celebrate
all kinds of love...i'm just going to
do something fun, irseemed lmpor»
ranr to do this year,“ commenced
Megan Love ‘01.

Rebecca Rush ‘02 plans to send
valentines to her friends saying, “...it's
like my roommate says, Valentine’s
Day can be the most horrible day of
the year ifit's exclusive to Just sweet-
hearts.“

“1 think all ofus [her friends] who
are single are going to have dinner
and seevvhar’s going on on campus,"
said Abby Copcman ‘01. “it kind
ofborhers me that we only rake one
day out ofrhe year to tell people we
care about them."

Nate solmose ‘00 had particuv
larly strong feelings about the sub—
ject. “lfl had a sweetheart, i would
try to make it special...l would re
spect the day irl had someone, Why
do we really need a Valentine’s Day?
lfwe’re in love, 'we should celebrate
ir everyday,"

Several students not included in
the survey rook it upon themselves
to plan an anti-Valentine’s day to be
shared by any students that ﬁnd
themselves alone.

“The Jilted Lovers’ study Break
is for rhegrcat masses orus who need
to purge the remaining feeling of
being fucked over in past relation-
ships," said Marie Mapcs ‘01. “Ca-
rharsis does a body good.”

The Break is going to be held on
Sunday at 9 pm, in Norris Lounge,

and the activites planned include writ-
ing valentines to past loves, followed by
destroying these valentines.

”Tent them up, burn them outside
on rhe grill, attach to a dart board,”
added Mapcs, “stories will be told, and
we will laugh and cry together."

The highlight ofthis event is a song
and dance to be performed by Jessica
schmidt ‘02, Margaret Seater '02 and
Phillip shaffner ‘02.

it could easily be argued that the
twelve students selected randomlyaren't
afairindicarion ofGrinnellsdatingpool
on a large scale, or how crinnellians feel
about Valentines Day in general.

Judging from these students how-
ever, ir isn’t as big ofa deal to singlestu-
dents as this article perhaps planned to
make it.

or maybe there's a huge protest
forming, staging a demonstration
against all of those tiny cards with bad

pressions.

Residential livingar Grinnell usu»
ally evolves over three stagcsi on-
campus housing (mandatory for one
year), off—campus collegcrowned
houses and nonecollcge-owncd apart-
ments and houses,

stage oneofrhisevolutionary pro-
cess entails dorm life, which makes
one privy to such exciting things as
making new friends (from being
forced to live with and endure all their
idiosyncrasies within enclosed spaces),
experiencing the joys ofsrudy breaks
that actually involve food and alco.
hol (ifyour HSC knows what's up),
and staying awake well past the witch.
ing hour, 1in spite ofyour eight o'clock
class the near morning), philosophiz-
ingabout issues ofconrroversylike eu.
thanasia, capital punishment and ve»
ganism.

oh the downside, dorm life can
severely intrude on your need for pri—
vacy. Plus, walking toweleclad back to
your room after having showered in a
stall full offun little personal souvee
nits that other people chose to leave
behind (like nasty hair balls) can
sometimes seem like too long a trek.

Then ofcourse, there are the shal-
tercd windows, ripped curtains, bro.
ken lounge furniture and destroyed
towel racks that appear almost every
weekend morning, that everyone in
the dorm gets to pay for as, mysterie
ously enough, noonc ever seems to
know who’s responsible for the dam-
age. ‘

Moreover, any parry thrown in a
dorm can be broken up as easily as
makinga phone call to die 1m: com»
plaining about the noise level [yeah
so hellooo? It’s a P-A-R-T—Yi.

Joseph Newbold '02 says that he
likes dorm life because it is located
close to everything. However, his
complaint is, “a new SA who provides
alcohol to all the floor residents on
weekday nights — nor that l mind the
alcohol consumption . but a belliget»
enr ruckus on aThursday night can
be bothersome, Also, the microwave
is all the way down in the pit!"

tiiiant ii am my . . .

1t wlMYmts oar atraoaearr
'm ”(K as a we uterus
none more“

Amber Marsh '00 says that living
in die dorms is nice because “you aren't
responsible for anything other than
yoursclfand ifsomething goes wrong
it is fixed quickly. Also you don‘t have
to cook and you are always around
people, which is great."

On the flip side or the coin, she
says that, "there are soo many people
with colds and I don’t like the phone
systemispcciﬁcally, long distance
charges.“

Some people tirc ordorm lite and
prefer to move away from the protec—
tive boundaries of college. Andrew
Choqucllc ’00 opted to live in a non
collegeowned house, speciﬁcally the
White House (ofluau and blockpaity
fame), and says that the pros ofliving
offcampus are‘thar “it has given me a
lot more space to live. Alongwith that,
the space allows you to get away from
the hectic lire in the dorms. Havinga
house also has become a great bond-
ing experience for my housemates and

1— plus it is a great place to throw .

parties.”

However, Chequette also feels that
“living off campus can sometimes
makes you feel like you are out orthe
loop ofwhat is going on in the dorms
and the social aspects of communal
living. I think this communal living
is an important component in a com-
plete college education and sometimes
1 miss that,"

Some people hold a slightly diffetr
enr view or living in noneeollege—
owned houses. Art Schroeder .00
claims rhar, "many ofthe err—campus
houses that are not college owned are
in a state ofdisrepair and decay, The
landlords of these houses should be
arrested as slum lords... i mean, have
you ever seen the White House? A
friend of mine lived there this sum.
mer and let’s just say he had a less than
pleasurable cxpenencc. . .although die
house does throw some great parties."

Allison Brummell ’01 opted to live
in a college owned house this year be.
cause she wanted the privacy and per-
sonal space made accessible to her by
living offecampus.

in addition, Btummel said, college
owned houses are in much better shape

than nonrcollegCrowned houses and
she wanted the perk of not having to
clean the house herself.

Drummell claims that living on
campus can sometimes get lonely as
people don't stop by to visit as often.
not on the brighter side, “ifyou want
to rhrow good parties, you definitely
need a house."

Cody skarning ’01 wants to move
otrcam pus neat year since he “does not
want to live in the dt rms all fouryears
here. lmnr alittle variety in my hous.
ing arrangements from year to year. I
also think irwould bode well for team

housemates will be b-ball players.”

All said and done though, housing
in Gtinnell ultimately boils down to a
personal preference, be is dorm lire or
ofhcampus housing.
