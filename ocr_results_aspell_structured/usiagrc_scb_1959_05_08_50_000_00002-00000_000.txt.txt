Sweat, Scream, Plan—For What

In the spring, young men's fancies tllru to thoughts of
I( e: At least, that is the best excuse that can be given (bee,
sides the fact that the pl incl-s didn't plan and the followers ‘
didn’t follow) for the fiasco last Monday night that some
people had the audacity to call the Spring Riot.

1n past years (or at least so we are told), the cries were l
“Let's go south," “Come out girls," and “Come in and get

This year after a dozen or so firecrackers and a fewi
; Ions of badly aimed (in most cases) water, the cry was
an apathetic and heartless “Oh, llell, let's go to the Union!“
And then the juke box wouldn't even work for awhile! i

Of course, the problem was evident from the first. Whyi
sl' eat, scream, plan, and 1' getting fined to free the girls,
“lien most of the girls were already free and even lnore
b d with the whole mess than were the men?

So the interrupted walks, golf games, bridge g'ames, and'
((llnnell tradition should let such a thing happen on riot
nightly studies were resumed. ‘
Of course there were the (IIE‘AIIEIITIS. But there was no

And with no cause, what need was there for determ-
on, daring, and just plain llorsing around ".7
Last Monday night represented a first great meeting
and clash of TRADITION and REFORM. _

Now we are faced with a problem. We must take true;
(ii ion‘and continue the planning, scheming. yelling, andl
tl ats involved in freeing tlle girls from their ”prison”?

,l'e:orln, represented in this case by extended hours, and allow
tile girls to ruin our frame freeing of fantastic frustrations.

In trlle collegiate fashion, we must try to hare our riotl
and late hours too (for traditionalists, the cliche is “have
or ' cake and eat it too").

Therefore, it is strongly recommended that in the fu-l
tl'- , the Committee for the Commencing and Execution of,
ti . Spring Riot (the CCESIl—we certainly need a New Deal
of some type) collaborate with the combined powerhouse of
the CofHP,’the AWSB, the SC, and the NW (night watch-
lnin) to impose 10 pm. hours on the night of the Spring’1
D-ot to insure the men a cause for which to r'ot.

Of course, such a rule would he a dead {I away as to

night of the riot, which is alvays kept a deep, dark

Therefore. next time, planners and followers, couldn't
we wait until midnight to lunch ollr crusade for the Iibel‘ar‘
tun of‘tlie Gl'iunell damsels who. as mentioned before, really
dmt' give a damn about being liberated in the first place?

- Acid
and
Base

by J. r, Vulgarish

Editor's note: The iolliiiving
is a modest proposal suggest.

‘ cd by J. P. Vulgarieh, a well

knuun cigarette magnate, for
the solving of th- economic

difficulties one meets in high-
er education.

It is a sort; (act which those
nliddlvclass parents face who
are not able to send their Cl‘ill‘
(iron to college without conside
arable sacrifice.

After the initial expense or
supporting their oiispring dur-

ing the stages of lower edum- “

tion, the inllowing years,
which should be years of leis.
nre and comicrt (if not. in-
deed, luxury), arc transform—
ed by college expenses into a
nightmare oi skimping, bor~
rowing, and endless toil.

And the sntiering thus ini-
poscd i perhaps even worse im-
the c ldren, who are iorccd to
ohscrvc their parents and dean
cst relatives growing thin and
haggard from the blood-sucking
expenses oi kccping them at

college.

But a far
terrible aspect oi the problem
oi middlcclass children in col—
lcglate education is thc sapping
away of the i _ ltutions' cndom
ineiits by the scholarships,
it ill-aid, and inonclary giits
whi i are needed to sustain this
nonpmductivc multitude for the
ncccssary iour ycai-s.

The i'unds”)vhicli should be
used ior physical expansion
oi the plant. audio-visual edu—
cational aids, psychological and
sociological research projects,
and publicity, are all, used
merely to sustain the costs oi
keeping tiie students in school.

I think it will be agreed by

all that this prodigious number,

or children supported by‘tho
endowments and gifts ci a few
successiul people (who are al~
rcady ci-ievnusly overtaxcd by
thc government) is a great 507
L-ial grievance, and, above all,
ii bad business proposition

To the Editor:
Grinnell. like most of the,

collcgcs o[ the United Stalcs,§
has enyoycd lhc hcnclits nl‘
highly lnlelllgent and encre
guilt labor at almost no cost to
itscli.

The employment
dents by colleges has some-
how hcen immune to come
inonly-nrcepted wage Stands
ards. The $.65 an hour that
is paid to most students ems
played at Griiiiiell is one-halt
oi the w' onsidcred n inir
minimum in today's economy ,
by the ample.

It is 50 percent lcss than the
outdated minimum wage sci by
the national government [01‘ In»

mercc.

The

of stil-

inpst cxploued minority
groups, such as the Pump
nican in Ncw York, get paid
$1 an hour to clcar table tops
in municipal restaurants whilc
college students get 3,55 an hour
for the same lob in Cowlcs and
the Quad.

xi we were to raise wage?
moderately, say to 5.30 an
hour, several things might

‘a handicap,

 

happen at the same time. The

iirst eiiect oi a rise in wages ,
would be a rise in the coir
lege's costs. This might be
reileeted liy an increase in
charges ior tnitioii, room and
board.

But at the same time this ln~
crease in costs to the students
could be partially mitigated by
ra ing the amount oi financial
aid to those who need it.

In this way, thc effect of,
the wagc increase would be tol
redistrlbute more equitably thej
burden of payment for educa-l
tion between the working Stu-l
dents and lhc students who are}
iinaiicialiy strong enough to‘
hear a greater load than they}
arc doing now. l

Those students who workl
as many hours as possible l
now, because oi extreme
need. would be helped by a
raise in wages. The incre.sed
cost to tlle‘cullege would be
partly compensated by a re—,
duetion in their need ior iiu-

We iecl that the lniormatiou
received by the senior class
regarding the Graduate Reu-
ords examination was entirely
misleading and inadequate.

de»elnphasis of the neeesslty ici-

eeived on the examination will

through his entire post-graduate

career,

To the junior class may we
heartily express our sincere
hope that you will not be as
misled as the senior class was
and take advantage or our
misfortune,

It you are told next year, “It's

‘not the type of exam you can

study tor." don’t believe it.
ciarnining is not necessary, but
review is essential.
