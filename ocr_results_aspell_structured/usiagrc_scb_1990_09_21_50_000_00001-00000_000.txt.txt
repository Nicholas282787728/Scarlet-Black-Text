Grinnell Raises
Awareness of
Harassment

By Joshua Ford

Homophobic incidents and re-
lated harassment have raised cam»
pus concerns. according to several
sources, including the minutes of
the first Student Government As-
sociationmeetingwhichmentioned
the occurrence of three such inci-
dents.

Dean of Student Affairs Tom
Crady said that he was concerned
about the increase and encouraged
anyone who feels they might have
been harassed on the basis of “sex,
race, national origin, sexual or
affectional preference (or) handia
cap" to report the incident to either
a resident advisor or the Student
Affairs office.

Crady stressed that all repons
are conﬁdential and that no action
will be taken without the student‘s
full Consent. At the student‘s
discretion, this consent can be
withdrawn at any point during the
process.

The nature of the harassment
thus far has been vague, but has
included defacement of Grinnell
Lesbian/Gay Alliance’s posters.

Harassmentofindividualshasbeen
rumored, but ,because of confi-
dentiality, cannot be conﬁrmed.

Dave Clark, a resident advisor
and head of the Human/Gay
Resource Center, stated that ha-
rassment of individuals often in-
cludes verbal assaults on students
entering or leaving the H/GRC.

“It takes time for people to get
acclimated to Grinnell either for
the first time or once again," said
Clark. He indicated that the rise
was something that was not sur-
prising for the beginning of the fall
semester.

He did add that the Harassment
Seminar given to the first year stu-
dents had made the incoming class
"deﬁnitelymoreawareandcautious
about what they say.“ He also
stressed that new students seem
more informed of the rules and
procedures for reporting harass-
ment.

Finally, Crndy encouraged stu-
dents to confront and report indi-
viduals whom they feel are suspect
of harassing others. Any student
found guilty of harassment may be
Subject to expulsion.
