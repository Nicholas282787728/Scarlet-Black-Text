Track and field comes out for the Dick

av Jar Gate

This past weekend, hundreds of students from dozens of
schools flocked to Grinncll College to compete in the annual
Dick Young Classic, This track and held meet, like most years
past, was the only home meet for the Pioneers, and they made
sure to take advantage ofit,

“I thought that everyone did great as a whole," said Ethan
Heppner ’11. “There were some personal records that were
smashed."

Overall, the women ﬁnished hard with 58 points, placing
them fourth out of 14 teams. As a team the ‘men frnishedwith
so points and garnered frfth place out of the lbeteam field.
The women produced two event champions, Becky Bessinger
'09 and Curran Johnson '09, Bessinger won the some-meter
steeplechase with a time ofll minutes, 56.55 seconds.

“The race went pretty well," Bessinger said. "It went better
than I expected it would, that was pretty sweet,"

Also placing frrst for the women's team was Johnson in the
high jump with a leap ofs feet, 1 3/4 inches. In the pole vault
Anna Gilbert ’09 ﬁnished second with a height of 976 1/4.
Johnson was pleased with her success at the meet despite her
inexperience.

"I didn’t compete before this season," Johnson said. “It was
my second best height."

0n the men’s side, three Pioneers placed third in their re
spective events—Joey Snyder '10 in the javelin with a toss of
179 feelié inches, Mike Hargadine ‘09 with aJump of13r11

“I’m glad that 1 got the experience of racing in a 10k before

going on to confetcnce,"Heppner said. “I made a couple ofmis-
takes in the frrst two miles going too slow but on the whole 1
was pleased with my race."

But Heppner wasn’t the only one satisfred by the Dick,

“All across the board we had solid performances,"said rune
ner Chris Wilson ’11. "We had guys do good in javelin, 200m,
steeple. 10k, and Nick Sparr [’09] had a great double in the
1500 and the 5k."

But some of the best performances of the day by the Pioe
neers were not easily noticeable on paper. In the sooemeter run,
Leah Russell ’11 shattered her personal record with a time of
222.23 to frnish eighth.

“I ended up running four seconds faster than my previous
best time," said Russell. "it Ms really good.”

In the lsooemeter run, Wilson ran a time 4:05.37, millisec-
onds behind Sparr who had a time of4rosm.

“It was a lot better than I ran all season outdoors,”Wilson
sard. “lfyou convert the trme into indoor length, it was the fast-
est time that I have ever run."

With the Dick Young Classic over, the teams will compete
in two more meets before competing in the Midwest Confcrv
encc Championships,

“If you look at the conference website right now, we have
a lot of guys in the top frve of many events," Wilson said. “We
are encouraged, we can improve on our frfrh place performance
from [the MWC Indoor Track and Field Championships] be
cause we pick up a couple [outdoor] events, and if you look
at the spread, there was only a few-point difference between
second and frfth place "

There are a few things that are almost always guaranteed
to happen when watching the draft. We‘ll see a montage
of fill the failed Jets picks (how soon will they add Vernon
Gholston's narne>), former Colts- GM Bill Tobin yelling at
Mel Kipcr Jr. after the latter criticized his choice of Trev

which let both the Jacksonville Jaguars and Carolina Pans

This, obvrously, is the most embarrassing draft moment
in Vikings history, even more embarrassing than drafting
Derrick Alexander the pick before the Bucs took Warren
Sapp, but 1 would like to set the record straight.

Yes. the missed pick is absolutelyinexcusable,but let's see
what really happened that day. The Vikings had a deal with
the Ravens in place to swap the number seven pick for the

The Panthers were next to step in front or' the Vikings,
and they fared quite a bit better than Jacksonville. They
chose offensive tackle Jordan Gross out nfUtah and he has
turned himself into a more than solid tackle on either the
rrght- or left side. Then again, tackle wasn't exactly a need for
the Vikings as the year before they got Bryant McKinnre.

Now, who did the Vikings select.> Well, they selected a
Senior Day wonder from Oklahoma State who turned into
a fuutrtlme allrpro selection at defensive tackle, Kevin Wil-
liams. Williams is, without a doubt, one of the top ﬁve see
lecrions from the entire draft and arguably the top defensrve
tackle rn the NFL. So, don't worry if your team seems to
screw up royally on draft day. Even the best seem to have
little clue as to which prospects wrll turn out well, and of-
tentimes, it's the “reaches"that turn out better than the cork
sensus picks.
