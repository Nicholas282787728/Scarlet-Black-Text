new student space for ceramics and photography

uvjolzv MANDEVILLE & MATT ZMUDKA

in a small building on a quiet corner of
Campus, Rob zyskowski '10 is getting dusty
and dirty, spending long hours working to crer
ate a new hidenwny for Grinnell artists.This is
the Strident Art Studio, a space that includes
a ceramics- area, run by Zyskowski and Kath
erine Robbins ’09.

This year, the studio is located in a small
building bchveen Haincs and James, the
former home of the publications ofﬁce. The
studio features two kilns, four wheels for clay
throwing storage and room to h1ng out Ad-
ditienalfy, a photography studio, led° by Rachel
walherg 09, is located in the space. And now
that all these resources are conveniently locat—
ed on campus, its organizers have high hopes
for its growth.

“It's really small, but it’s incredibly well set
up for a ceramics studio," Zyskowski said. “We
have everything we could possibly need."

Mosr importantly, the studio is on cam-
pus. Before last semester, it was located in a
community building offrcamplls, causing
problems with transportation and ownership
of materials. It has also been in the basement
of the PFC.

The studio has experienced several change
es since last year. Much of last year’s staff has
graduated, Also,it has ofﬁcially been renamed
the “Student Art Studio" from the “Snident
crartwerkshop."

“I didn’t like that it was called a craft stu-
dio," Zyskowski said. “It lwas] intended the
people would Come in here, have their fun and
not take it seriously." 7

The studio has beneﬁted from the admins
rstration’s support. Sheree Andrews, assistant
dean and director of Residence Life, serves as
an advisor [or the studio. “I love working with
the students that are involved,” Andrews said.
“Because they have kind ofa Vision of what
they want to do and then they just go for it
and I’m there to support that vision, and it’s
really run to watch."

For Zyskowski, the studio is here to serve

nonrArt majors who still care ahnut ceramics
and wlint to produce quality work.

“i would like to have as many people in-
volvcd as i can if they really, really ear-e about
it,” he said. “That’s what I want to see, I want
to see people who love art but aren’t neces-
sarily studying art,"

To achieve that goal, Zyskowski is adch
rising around campus for people to help run
the studio.

“What I ve found rs that its really hard for
me to just run the studio by myself," he stud

once 1 get eveiyrhing in place I think i ll get
people hired; Ill be able to fallback and teach
people and let it grow."

Lindsey Walter '11 responded to the call
for student workers, “My biggest hope is that
a lot ot'people sign up so that] can teach a lot

. ofpeople what 1 know, and 1m so excited tor

the class,"she said.

Future goals include putting on a show of
srudenr»pi-oduced art in the smith Gallery
next to the dining hall. Zyskowski would also
like to teach classes in the studio on Saturday
and Sunday,

Zyskowski is looking forward to seeing
how the ceramics studio grows this semester

Iw1nt to get people in here who are serious
about what they do and who are serious about
rut, who mt: serious rrhout' improving their at-
tistic ability."

Brit, as Walter attested, being serious about
art doesn't mean not having run “It's a really
chill environment, everyone's laid back so it's,
like, really easy and a stress—free zone."

Mon.-Thurs., 6-l0 p.m.

Last week, a woman’s en-

trance surprised Clyde.:.

“Hey you,"she yelled.

“What“ Clyde was confused; he had
never seen this early 20rsomething before.

“That your truck?" She pointed. Black
smoke was leaking from under the hood of
Clyde‘s F7150.

He forgot the Busch. And as he ran out
the door of Bernie's Bait Shop something
exploded under the hood, making the truck
jump and singeing the red and white aw-
ning on the store’s front. This was the ﬁrst
time Clyde saw Beth, and every interaction
since their fateful—some would say explo-
siveiﬂrst meeting has been nothing but
bad news hears for Clyde.

Clyde had heen irring in Badgers {or
about 45 minutes, unliw c oranvthmg l‘icV

yond his can of Bud and the little section of
grungy countertop underneath it.

in that time, business had picked up; James
guessed that at least 15 customers had entered,
but Clyde could not have cared less. He sat
there so slumped and dejected on the stool that
other customers assumed him to be part of the
bar for he exuded the defeated peailng attitude
orrhe building.

James was surprised when out ofthe corner
of his eye he caught a motionda trucker hat
blurred in turning—and realized that Clyde
had turned to look back at the door. The door
opened and the ﬂuorescent blue Light from the
parking lot leaked in, contaminating Badgcr’s
dim interior. Beth walked in,

Clyde pulled his hat down tighter on his
head and popped his collar up as iflic was try-
ing to get lost under his coat. Bur Beth spotted
him, came across [liC room and sat down on
the stool next to him

Mysterious musician to
intrigue Grinnellians Sat.

Jandck, for those in the know, has become
the musician sinonynious with mystery. The
wishes of the musical project and record he
bel are to remain a product of the music, not
a name. And ifwe thought a live performance
might resolve some questions, that shouldn't
be too conﬁdently expected.

landcks career has been nearly 30 yc1rs in
the making Since 1978, the cooperative record
label Corwood Industries has produced 51 al-
bums, The /
only way for
a fan to get a
hold of one of
these records
is Via mail or-
der. the artist’s
only method
of correspondence. Colwood Industries, the
name ofthc record lube] he runs himself, hanr
dles all communication.

Jandek, whom tereis to himself only as a
"representative of Corwood Industries," is en's
tiaottlimirily elusive. His tlrst live appearant-e
“MW in 2004 and ice then he has continued
to do pcirnnnmtes sporadic-uh throughout
the Us and Lt 3pc, hut that dncs nor in any

He goes to great lengths to avoid displaying
his identity, even switching up instruments and
members of the group during performances.
For fans of Jandek, attending live shows,
unlike most concerts, doesn’t involve singing
along with ramiliar songs. Jandek does nor
usually play recorded songs; instead the show
leans towards the improvisational and unre-
hcarsed. The group will usually only practice

together once, during the afternoon preceding

the show, His
Jandek

music has only
mumbled lyr-
6 7:30 pm.

ics, if they are
present at all.
When in use,
his lyrical style
has been come
pared to Eastern Texas traditions, a likely
inﬂuence considering Corwood industries is
believed to be located in Houston.

But the style remains unlike any other, es-
pecially live, Purposely misruning the instrur
ments, playing no legitimate or dis lnlble
notes and generating most of the unit on
the spot. that's \\'l\\t to expect licatlnig into
