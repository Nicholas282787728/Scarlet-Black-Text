GANZ IS CONDUCTOR 0F
' EXCEPTIONAL ABILITY

Mme. Lazzalli, Soloist, With a. Rich
Contralto Voice, Is Well
Appreciated.

(By L, E. Anderson)

There was a real welcome for M
Ganz and the st. Louis Symphony or-
chestra in the two orchestral. concerts
yesterday, which made up Gl'innell’s
23rd annual music festival. Perhaps
the appetite w. the more keen be-
'cause of the t . thatsince M Ganz‘s
appearance a your ago we have bod no
such orchestral musi , and shall not
again for another year. At any rate.
such a concert as was presented to
Gririnell music lovers last evening
makes us realize how complete is our
isolation in this regard, and brings
back the wish that we were nearer the
centers Where such music is almost
daily food.

The afternoon's Concert was on the
whole a rather disappointing one.—
hotb in the program presented and in

the manner in which it was played:

The orchestra showed the effect or
having traveled all the night before,
and there was a. noticeable lack in the
ensemble, in precision of attack and
in ﬁnish in general. No doubt‘these
failures of the orchestrawere paruy
due also to the type of the works pre-

sented, for what band of players can‘

throw themselves, as wholeheartedly
into Herbert’s American Fantasy as
into Wagner's Mastersinger Overture
01' Brahm's Second Symphony? Per-
haps the most enjoyable numbers of
‘the afternoon, from a. popular stands
point, were the V‘Villiam Tell Overture,
Gl'ainger’s shepherd's Hey. played as
an encore to the 4th group (which had
to be repeated) and especially Mr.

Steindel‘s playing of Popper’s Hun“

gal—lain Rhapsody. With a. splendid

feeling for the spirit of the composi-

tion, Mr. Steindcl proved himself every

inch the master of his instrument.

Mr. Ganz’s informal talk after the
ﬁrst number, introducing to the chil—
dren o! the
members ol the orchestral “iamilY"

fair to state. in passing, that Mr. Ganz
had really planned the alternon pro—
gram with the impression that it was
to he distinctly a children's program.
Had he realized otherwise the program

probably would have taken a differentl

form.

Whatever of disappointment We may
have felt in the afternoon disappeared
like magic when Mr. Gan: took up the
baton in the evening.

There was a precision of attack, 8.

nieety or balance. a feeling of ensem-l

ble and ﬁnish and flexibility that
would have been Worthy of a much
older orchestra.

Bmhms’ Second Synmlluny.

The real meat of the evening's pro-
gram Was found naturally enough in
Mr. Ganz's reading of the Brehms' Sec—
ond Symphony. The score is brim-
ming full of good things worked out
with all the perfection always charac—
teristic of Brahms and it may his Said
to Mr. Gent's credit that he made the

most of his opportunities, and that,

under his leadership the work achieved
a real, red-blooded existence. To the
symphony Mr, Gen]. was compelled to
respond with an encore, for which he

—-a most happy choice indeed.

No review of the program would be
complete without an appreciation of
the eont‘rlbutlon of Mme. Luzzari. the
soloist of the evening, Possessed of a
pleasing personality and a contralto
voice unusually rich. especially in the
cxtrsmltles of her range, she brought
to her numbers a wan-nth of feeling
that was truly delightful, and in her
singing of the aria from "Samson"
hchieved a real triumph. Less fortu-
nate, however, were her choices of
eucoles which followed; the aria
would have been better alone,4r in
better company.

We regret sincerely the passing of
the festival. Would that we could hold
