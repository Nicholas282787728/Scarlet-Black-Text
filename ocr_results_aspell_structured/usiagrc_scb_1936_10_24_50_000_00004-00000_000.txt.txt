Fresh Make Plans
for Pep-Picnic
Wednesday Night

Plans for a pep»picnic and for
the general program for the yearl
were discussed at a meeting of
freshman class officers and spe-
cial guests last Wednesday night.

The officers decided to hold a
pep-picnic at 6 o'clock in the wom-
en's gymnasium Wednesday eve<
ning. All freshmen are required
to attend. and dinner will be served
only to upperclassmen in the din-
ing halls.

The purposes of the picnic are
to get the class members better
acquainted, and to promote en-
thusiasm for the freshman foot»
ball game with the Comell frosh
on Saturday morning, according
to class officers,

other plans discussed included a
sleigh ride, treasure hunt, and a
combined class dinner. No defi»
nite action was taken on any of,
these proposals, however. Class
dues were set at 25 cents a semes-
tcr.

Special guests at the dinner in-
clude Shelton L. Beatty, dean
of men; Miss Evelyn Gardner,
dean of women; and Allen Ross-
inan, president of the Student
council,

High's placekick for the extra i
point was no good, and the Pio» l
neers trailed, 7-6.

Washbnrn scored late in the
second quarter after Vigole inter-
cepted Evans’ pass on the Wash»
hurn 21-yard line. Kinter passed
to Brady for a first down on the
Grinnell 49»yard line. Three later»
als brought the ball to the Grin-1‘
nell 20»yard line, and Kinter
passed to East for the touchdown.
Mix entered the game and con-
verted with a placekick, making
the score Washburn 7, Grinnell 0.

Threatened in .First Half

Both teams threatened several
times in the first half, but failed ,
to make good because of fumbles
or intercepted passes. Early in the
second quarter Scblotterbeok in—
tercepted a Washburn pass and
took it 50 yards to the Washbuin
35-y/al'd line. Two plays brought
the'ball to the lchabods' 20, but
Schlotterbcck fumbled on the next
play and Washburn recovered.

Washburn drove the ball to the
Grinnell 19-yard line at the first of
the second quarter, but a fumble
by Kinter was recovered by Snow.

Preston Evans and Schlotter-
beck bore the brunt of the Grin»
nell attack while Kinter, Brady,
and Vigola looked best for Wash-
burn. Both teams fumbled three
times in the first half, but had
better luck in the second period,
neither team making a break.

“ ‘Viuxly' played the violin beauti-
fully,” the narrator continued
jokingly, “but since Frances joln~

husband instead of the music, and
consequently, his playing has suf-

yesterday. "Theta Sigma phi

can be made."

“Sigma Delta Chi feels that it
would be inadvisable to hold such
a dinner on a Friday night, and
since the only available week-end
night would not be until Nov‘em-

Under-water Cleaner
Used in Louisiana Pool

Baton Rouge, LaitACPy—All
under vatci- vacuum Cleaner! That
is the device that has been em»
ployed, at Louisiana State unive
isity. for washing out the swim-
ming pool while it is full of water.

A man dons a diving helmet and
goes to the bottom to "vacuum
up" the trash that gathers. The
same water can be used for scver-
al weeks at a time. A great sav-
illg. But the water is not mo»
tionless, it is going in and out of
the pool at the rate of 750 gallons
a minute and passulg through a
purifier. A solution of copper sul»
phate keeps algae from forming.

“Slllca the inauguration of the
new system," Mr. w, G. ”Hicky"
Higgiubotham, states, “the bac-
‘tcria count has bccn kept below
so. Thc avcragc pool has a count
of between from 500 to 900.1‘

Higginhothom declares that the
water is better than most drink»

Objections Filed
to Probating
’C. S. Clarke Will

Objections to the probate of the
will of Cornelia S. Clarke, nature
photographer and honorary cura-
tor of the herbarium, were filed
this week in the district court at
Montezuma by Mildred Fuller, a
cousin

Under the terms of the will the
major part was left to Dr. c. J,
Turner and his wife. Included in
the minor bequests is one to Hem
ry s Conard amounting to $200.
Also included in this bequest are
all of the photographic equipment,
plates and lantern slides which
Miss Clarke used during her life.

In the objection filed in the dis-
trict court, it is charged that Dr.
Turner and his wife exerted un-
duo influence upon Miss Clarke at
the time that the will was drawn.

The status of the gift to Mr.
Conard and to the college in case
the will is broken, is unknown.
Dr. Coiiard could not be reached
for a statement this morning.

Miss Clarke died Septcmber 29,
after being an invalid for several
years as a result of injuries suf—
fei-cd in an auto accident,

She first came into prominence
when she changed from photogra»
phy as a hobby to photography as
a profession in 1912, It was in
that year that she published her
first illustrated children's book,
“Peter and Polly." From 1912 un-
til the time of her death Miss
Clarke’s photographs of animals,
insects, and flowers have appeared
in various publications throughout
the world.

The First Catholic college in
the United States was opened in
1677 at Newton, Maryland. _

An alarming shortage of room
and board jobs may cause 200
students of the University of Wis-
cousin to withdraw from school.
