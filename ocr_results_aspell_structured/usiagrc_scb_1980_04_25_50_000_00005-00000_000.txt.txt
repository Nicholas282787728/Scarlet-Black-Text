‘An earth-shaking discovery

trom Grlnrlell Herold~Regisler

Senior physics major Jnhn Bullitt
made an earthsshaking discovery
when he recently checked a recording
device he had built.

The device is an amateur
seismograph, which up to last Sunday
showed nothing more striking than a
record of Bullitt walking around in im~
promptu lab in the basement or the
Physical Education Complex.

But on Sunday, the young scientist
saw an array of long, irregular lines
that meant only one thing: The device
had recorded a major earthquake

originating thousands of miles from

After measuring the intervals be-
tween arrival times of the different
shock waves, Bullitt did a little com-
puting and fixed the quake’s point of
origin in the South Pacific.

Surprised and excited, he waited un-
til the next day to try to verily that his
handrbuilt equipment had told the
truth. ‘

Placing a call to the National Earth-

Women face sex

lrom Collegiate Hedlmes Services

Women are still being discouraged
from entering nontraditional
vocational fields, according to a U.S.
Office of Education study.

The report, prepared by a California
research firm from interviews at high
schools, technical institutes, and
community colleges in 49 states, says
that women are discouraged from
entering such high-paying iields as auto
mechanics at more than on percent of
the schools.

while some community employment
plans have helped promote sex equity

oi Chicago.

Booth received his PhD. from the
University oi Chicago in 1950. and was
elected Phi Beta Kappa in 1962. His
most recent books include: Now Don't
Try to Reason With Me: Essays and
[rallies for a Credulous Age (1970) and
A Rhetoric of Irony (1974).

the South Pacific” and that his own
computation was just a shade off the
exact point of origin.

Dr. Beryl E. Clotfelter, Williston
professor of physics at Grinnell, said
that Bullitt's seismograph and its
record of an earthquake “are certain-
ly firsts for Grinnell.”

Clotfelter added, “The college is not
big enough to have a seismograph
center, but through John’s work we
now have a sensitive operating instru-
ment.”

iew school systems, the study says.
Those schools that have actively
worked to overcome sex discrimination
have the greatest number of students
enrolled in nontraditional courses,
proving that schools can help deter-
mine the type of courses chosen, ac-
cording to the report.

As a result of the findings, the
Office of Education has hired a s ecial
adviser on women‘s issues to war with
vocational educators and has launched
a program to help women prepare for
jobs in traditionally male occupations.
