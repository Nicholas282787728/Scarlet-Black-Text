Although vision specialists agree
that television Is not likely to cre-
nte serious new visual problems,
the American Optometric Associa-
tion has just issued seven “do’s
and don't’s” for television watch-
ers designed to prevent eye dis-
comfort. ”Ii-lay are:

1. For clearest possible recep-
tion, be sure your set is properly
installed, with particular atten-
tion to the antenna,

2. 1n tuning, adjust tone setting
before turning the picture up to
desired brilliance. strike a com-
foriable balance between steadi.
ness at image and brilliance. Too
much light or a wavering image
will cause visual discomfort.

3. Avoid both intense darkness
and bright light in the room. it
the room is totally dark, there
wlli‘be too much contrast between
the bright screen and the cur;
roundings. 'l'oo bright light will
distract your eyes lrorn the screen
Mild, indirect light is pretersble.

unnatural conditions. . Don’t wear
them for television.

Hey, Put Your Shoes On, Grinnell;
Square Dancing It Hére to Sta} l

By Don Gregg ‘

Think jitterbugglng leaves you}

winded? Do your muscles achel,
aitcr a last Les Brown? Broth»
or have you tried square dam-s
ing?

i didn't try it‘ but I watched;
the Barnstcrmers go through all
couple oi swilt little reels and

decided to keep on watching.

For the last couple of years;

the country has been movingl
back to the old time country_
dances. Flrst it was a novelty,[
then people began getting star-,-
lous about square dancing. Hal»;
lywood grabbed it, the collegeSl
mod it, and plenty of communr
ties began looking lor dance
callers.
. Here at Grinnell a group
of square dance enthusiasts
formed a club, calling themslves
the'“Barnstdl‘mers.” Every Mons
day night they meet in the girls’[
gym to learn new dances a_ndE
practice one from the week be-‘
fore.

Lynn and Bob Whitham olilc-
cr the club and do most'ot the
teaching. Both have done plen-
ty oi square dancing and have
spread their enthusiasm arouhd._
Last year the Gadabouts spon-
sored an all college dance; the
turnout was big.

Square dancing isn’t easy.
There are more intricate turns
and dips than jump dancing ever
thought of. And speed counts:
Every other second the caller

sounds off with something new.
The slow man finds himself
standing alone loohing ior ”the
