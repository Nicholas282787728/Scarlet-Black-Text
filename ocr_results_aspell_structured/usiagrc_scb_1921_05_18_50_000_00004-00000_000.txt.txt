The Awful Tr gedy Rhtck Jim
Block Jim was the terrilile hunter
.of the village of Helknow, which is
lsituated just north-west of the Dec
vollsch Mountains. One day he was
up among the prccipiccs hunting
muskrats, when he fell down into the
valley, crushing all the flowers in the
hroutilul meadow. Nothing daunted,
he returned to the highest peak, and
shot bumble bees for two hours and
a half. One bumble—bee,'grently pain-
ed by a bullet in his chest, allghtcd
gracefully on Black Jim's hack, and
partook of an excellent sting. This
caused a bad feeling to spring up be-
twecn Black Jim and the bumblerbee.
While Black Jim was madly fighting
the horrihlc‘hee, he fell into the valley
again, breaking his neck. Under such
conditions the1e was nothing for him
to do out die. so he did.
