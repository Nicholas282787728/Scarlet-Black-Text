No Country for
e—' Old Men (2007)

Strong acting and directing

make for worthy Oscar winner

Usually any mention of the Oscars elic-
its Little response from me bcsrdes some dis»
contented muttering about selfrcongrritular
tory, insipid Hollywoodrcentrism, This year.
though, the bigwigs made the right call when
they awarded Best Picture to N0 Coimli'yﬁr
Old Mm. It certainly was the best film I’ve
seen in the past yeariin quite a few years, for
that matter.

Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) stumbles
across the scene of a drug deal gone wrong
while hunting in the plains of Texas. He takes
a satchel containing two million dollirrs and
leaves. Forced to ﬂee his home, Llewclyn finds
himself pursued by some very dangerous peo-
ple from both sides of the dcill, including the
deadly Anton Clngnrh (Javier Bardem), an
idiosyncratic psychopath who makes killing
both his business and his pleasure. Meanwhile,
the local sheriff (Tommy Lee Jones) follows
the trail of bloodshed, hoping to track down
Llewelyn before anyone with lcss friendly in-
tentions does,

After a couple ofdisappointing recent outs
iugs, directors Joel and Ethan Coen are back
in fine form here. It’s easiest to draw parallels
to Fargo, the film that first catapulted them to
the limelight, but there are also similarities to
Bland Simple, the Coen brothersY earliest work,
The coens have a remarkable ability to stay
respectful towards whichever genres they are
working within (in this case, Western and
crime thriller), and yet still defy filmmaking
conventions in surprising and clever mys,
making their ﬁlms feel fresh and inspired
while remaining familiar.

The acting is fantastic throughout. Brolin
ﬁts the bill nicely as a bmsque loner, savvy and
resourceful, but still in over his head. jones is
likeablc as a sheriff unsure how to interpret
the evils he witnesses, and Woody Harrelson
makes a delightful appearance as charismatic
“day trader" Carson Wells. But the real star is
Bardem, absolutely riveting as Chigurh. Every
scene with him leaves the viewer gripping the
armrests, afraid for the life ofanyone who unr
wittingly crosses Chigurh’s path as he stalks
his prey with frightening skill.

Go see No Cumilryfui‘ Old Men. Go see it
right away. Unless you are easily frightcncd,
you won’t regret it. And even if you spend the
next two days reinforcing the locks on your
door, it might still be worth it. It’s just that
good.

thatwouldn’t come until the 1960s: a question-
ing oftradinonal morals, a cynical tone and a
more realistic conception ofthe hero. it helped
pave the way for the contemporary Western
subgenres that exist today, where films like
Eta/Ewart Mormmin and Semrily find a home.

The story, which begins at 10:35 in the
morning in the small town of Hadleyvrllc,
Kansas, plays out in real time over the hour
and twenty ﬁve minutes leading up to noon.
This technique gives the movie a tense atmo-
sphere, with the camera frequently panning to
clocks showing less and less time remaining.

At noun, a bandit named Frank Miller (Ian
MacDonald) is set to arrive by train to seek
revenge against the man who tried to put him
away: retiring Marshall Will Kane (Gary Coor
per ’26). Kane decides to put off his retirement
to detend the town once again from Miller, a
decision that both upsets his patifrsrvvitc Amy
(Grace Kelly) and reveals the cowardly nature
of the town Kane protects.

Most ofthe film consists ofnn increasingly
terrified looking Kane trying to round up any
one in Hadleyville to help him against Miller
and his gang. Any notions of honor disappear
as the citizens refuse to help, instead wanting
to play it smart and not get hurt. Kane becomes
more disillusioned as he realized the sordid
nature ofthe town he has protected for years.
and the pain and disappointment play across
Cooper's race beautifully as he mlks around
the desertcd streets desperatcly sccking help.

High Noon sought to dispel many of thc
cliches about honor and bravery present in
Western cinema at the time, and its relevance
is no less important today. It represents a key
turning point in Hollywood: evaluation of the
classic hero and raised the bar for every West-
ern to come after.

The Lord of the |
~ Rings (2001-03)

Classic good»and-evi| bat—
tle creates enthralling epic

Brace yourself ladies and gentlemen; this
is the mother of all adventures. Watching the
cleveuehour T/JeLm'd 0/1/13 Ringr trilogy, farthr
fully based on the novels of the same names
(Tin Forster/rip off/M Ring, TI): Toto Tower;
and The Return time King) by J.R.R. Tolkien,
might seem like a Herculean task, but it rs well
worth the time and effort invested.

For the few of you who still don't know
what this trilogy rs about. it follows the young
hobbit Frodo Baggrns as he and his compnnr
ions (the Fellowship) embark on a quest to de
stroy an evil ring, thus ensuring the destruction
ofrrs maker, the Dark Lord Sauron and his ally
Satuinnn. The Fellowship becomes divided,
and Frodo continues the quest together with
his loyal companion Sam and the treacherous
Gollum, Meanwhile, the wizard Gandalf and
Aragorn, heir in exile to the throne of Condor,
unite and rally the free people ofMiddlc-earth
for the War ofthe Ring.

Some of the actors in the series areestab»
lished Hollywood names, like Elijah Wood
(Ftodo), Sean Bean (Boromrr) and Christos
phcr Lee (sanrman), while others were pulled
out of relative obscurity They all turn in der
cent performances, bur the acting is really of
secondary importance in this trilogy.

so what keeps the movie gonrg, if it is
not the performances (decent but not stellar)
or thc script (engaging but not novel)? Three

things: first, the amazing outdoor locales and
visuals allied with stunning camerawork give
the movie an unprecedented appeal. sccond,
the special effects in the movies and technical
mastery of the crew is quite breathtaking, and
the absence of guns and high—tech gadgets is a
welcome relief

And ﬁnally, you can't beat the old»as-hills
concept of the fight between good and evil,
with good people being greatly outnumbered
by the evil ones yet still finishing on top
through their brilliance and resilience. This'
feelrgood approach of Very clearly dichoto-
mizirig good and evil with the good eventually
triurnphing over evil gives the trilogy a drive it
would otherwise lack.

Any downers? Well, length is really the
only obvious deterrent, Not everyone has 11
hours to spend on a movie series in which ev»
ery scene is predictable and there is no real plot
twist. And as a byproduct ofthe oveirlinearity
of the script, the pace seems too slow at times.

The Lord aft/it Ringr is an epic adverr
ture, not only for the characters but also for
the viewer. If you have the time to invest, go
ahead and watch the movres. It is magniﬁcent,
grandiose and breathtaking, and if you enter
the theater with an open mind you Will return
extremely satisfied.
