Inter Future Program Reviewed;
Participants Discuss Experiences

by Sue Steinvmll

“lnterFuture gives young men and
women of different nations the
chance to explore together a global
issuewlike “Man'silabitat”or”ln-
ternationalism"~and share their
ﬁndings with friends and mentors "
lnterFuture (Intercultural Studies
of Man’s Future) hopes to provide
undergraduates with the opportunity
“to help their fellow Students and
local communities prepare inter-
culturally tor the 21st century."
During the past three years slur
dents have designed and carried

out field studies in Ghana, Ireland,
Jamaica, the Netherlands, and the
United Kingdom. They investigated
ditterent aspects or world issues
such as “internationalsim,” "habr
itat," and “individual and Society,"
The basic plan behind InterFutlIre,
in contrast to other on Campus
programs, is unique. Collegetreshr
man or sophomores may apply to
the program. It elected, the name
inees will attend national confer-
ences. At the beginning oi the Sum-
mer, guest experts and students
meet together at an exploratory
conierence. Each participant begins
to develop his own cross cultural
approach to the interdisciplinary
theme.

The student then engages in in,
dependent research throughout the
summer. At the end or the summer,
the participants meet again to exa-
mine their theses and methods. In-
terFuture sponsers a cultural imr
mersion experience duruig this con-
i'erence. The students are sent into
an “alien” environment such as
Chinatown in New York and are
asked to define the aspects oi the
community. This lesson is designr
ed to teach the participants the vale
ue and accompanying diliiculties
of cultural research in the field.
The participants spend the tall see
mester prior to the tield work
abroad, developing and research»
ing their research prolects. This
preparation can be accomplished
through independent or course work.
The student engages in the actual

iield work during the spring semr
ester or summer. He is assigned
an advisor and a co-participant
with Whom the participant works.
InterFuture hopes that after the
semester abruad,the student will
present a seminar to the college

community. In that way,lnterruture
hopes that the participant will share

and field work.

James Magee,iormerpoliticalsci-
ence professnr at Grinnell, intros
duced InterFuture to Grinnell note
ing that InterFuture not only pro-
vides Students with an overseas
study and research experience, but
alsu provides an opportunity for the
Students to channel their exper-
iences back into the college.

Teel Haas and Craig Murphy were
lhterFuture participants during the
1972773 School year. Haas traveled
to The Hague, Netherlands and stur
died the International Court oi Jus—
tice with relation to South Africa.
Murphy spent the spring semester
in Great Britain and the summer
in Ghana. He studied the UN cocoa
agreement-its creation,interestgr-
oups and effects

Both Haas and Murphy generally
regard lnterFuture iavorably but
are critical of InterFuture’s are

ganizational diiiiculties.
Murphy emphasized that in his
opinion the Ghana program is the

TEEL I-IAAS

best part of the entire program.
The Ghana program is organized
by Jawa Aprontl, an ”excellent co-
ordinator ” Participants in theGh-
anaian program had co-participants
to act as tellow scholars, companr
ions, and iriends

participants in Ghana were re
quired to orally detend their papers
in tront oi all the advisers and also

in front DI a specialist, In Murphy’s
case, he defended his paper in
front of Max Steuer, the head of

the economics department oi the

University pi Ghana. Murphy rer
commends the Ghana program to
those interested in study in the
third world, particularly hirica.

grams, lnterFuture does not place

mphasizes independent work Lind
provides student with an opportu-
nity to pursue an extensive inde—
pendent prOJect. Independence and
the opportunity to “meet the culr
titre” unhampered by h structured
study program are the primary
benetits oi lnterFuture, according
to both Haas and Murphy.

They also noted that lnterl‘uture
provides an international reference
system. The system cross-reierv
ences InterFuture participants and
their friends and is potentially a
line set up, interFutureparticlpants
are generally irom diverse backr

year’s participants are minority
students

In general, InterFuture creates a
group consciousness, That is, the

Gregg Golden is this year’s Interr
Future participant. He will travelto
Great Britain to complete his cross
cultural analysis or the pohce (unc—
tion in the small town. Golden was
attracted to the program because
InterFuture pliers an opportunity
to do independentoverseas research
and also because the research done
under the interruture program is
viewed as serving the peoples of
the world,

V S, Verrette, the InterFuture
program director at Grihnell, strv
esses that the program is designed
for the rare student who combines
a high academic standing, an ability
to conduct independent work, and an
interest in applicable subject

WASHINGTONWArOund many petty
or industry»indentured burearcra-
cies in Washington, the best civil
servants are in a conﬂict of alle-
giances, By obeying unjust or cor-
rupt orders, they are violatingtheir
personal obligation or public trust
in their public ottice, By disobeying
such orders, they run the risk or
being tired or isolated into an empty
crime with empty duties,

it is not easy from many consci-
entious government employees to
learn that the way to lose your job
is to do your job.

Ernest Fitzgerald, the iormercost
reduction expert for the Pentagon,
learned the hard way when he {our
ght against waste as a way at doing
business in deiense contracting. In
1968, he “committed truth" (as he
put it) by testifying betore Senator
William Proxmire’s cummitteeabr
out a $2 billion overrun 0n the L0—
ckheed csa cargo plane contract
Although supported by severalmemr
hers or congress andnewspaperedr
itorials, Fitzgerald lost his job. It
took over a year {or top Pentagon
and White House otticials to eltect
his separation train the Department
by abolishing his position, asaPenr
tagon ”economy move" no less!

Fitzgerald, unlike many heroic cl-
vii servants who sutter their expul-
sion or demotion in Silence,decided
to light back. Assisted by the Ame
erican Civil Liberties Union's law-
yers, Fitzgerald obtained last mo-
nth an order trom the civil Ser-
vice Commission (CSC) to reinstate
him at the Pentagon with $100,000
back pay,

It was not a satistactory Victory
and Fitzgerald may decide toappeal.
For one thing, the CSC did not con»
clude that he was dismissed because
he blew the whistle on the CSA
waste betdre the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress. It stated,
incredibly enough, that the Penta-
gon tired him because the Depart-
ment believed he was the cause of
“unjust publi ty” in the press,

The Commission’s own records
in the case contradict this evasion
and support the disclosure or the
overrun as the motivation for Fitzr
gerald’s forced departure So cale
culated was the enmitv or his sup»

eriors that the Air Force Office
or Special investigations destroyed
all iavorable reports returned on
Fitzgerald as a result 0i their in—
vestigations. In a memo from White
House aide, Alexander Butterﬂeld
to H.R. Haldeman on January 20,
1970, Buttertield said: “Fitzgerald
is no doubt a top—notched cost ex,
pert, but he must be given very low
marks in loyalty; and after all, 10y»
alty is the name at the game.”
Loyalty to whom and tar what?
The Code oi Ethics ior Govern-
ment Service -- a little read doc-
umentﬁstates: “AnypersoninGov-
ernmental service should put loy-
alty to the highest moral principles
and to country above loyalty to per
son, party, or Government depart,
ment."

The csc avoided a proper Oppe
ortunity to ascribe responsibility
to Fitzgerald's superiors who e57
caped all accountability tor their
collusive and illegal behavior. It
tailed to order the Air Force to
include reasonable legal expenses
as a part or the retroactive pay
due Fitzgerald. Had he been requi-

red to pay {or the ACLU’S legal
services, his legal expenses would
have more than absorbed back pay
or $100,000.

So the Fitzgerald case, however
it may cast credit on one man’s
stamina and accuracy, is not likely
to help other civil servants who
are daily ordered or expected to
ccver»up, violatethelrdepartment’s
own rules, expose the citizen to
unconscionable abuse or waste the
taxpayer’s money.

Few people outside Washington
realize how important it is to retorm

it Supports the competent and law-
abiding civil servant instead 0! shi-

or well-connected otticials running

cardinal issue.

Senator Proxmire intends tointror
duce legislation about government
employee rights and accountability.
Such legislation would protect the
rights of the publiCrinterest—minded
civil servant. But it would also give
citizens some rights againsttederal
