Mass Meetlng To-morrow.

A mass meeting ot Sltldents is
announced for Thursday altel‘r
noon in the chapel at 4:l5. it M
said that it will posltlvcly be the
most turrltl event of [its Irintl tllsll
has transpired herenhnnts
several years. There is a large
amount of business to engage the
attention of the assembly. and a
program ot rare quality is assured.
There are one or two things which
can bc alluded to and a tew. not
the least edifyillg. whose nature
will be known wlteuthe meeting
has adjourned. The latter alone
will be well worth the trouble ol
attending. while the former are
deserving the most Careful con-
sideration from the student body.

The main matter of business
will be the proposed athletic
compact between S. U. I. and
Grinncll. Its provisions are by
this titne familiar to most of the
students. The proposition is, to
say the least. very radical. It
should not be discussed in any
half hearted manner. For ycar:
thcrc has bcen a crying need of
athletic reform in Iowa. Every
school in the state which ﬁgures
to any extent on the track. grid-
iron or diamond. is admitted to
have been in the dirt. It has
been demanded. however. that. S.
U. I. and Grinncll. the recognized
leaders in Iowa sport, take' the
leadinreform. It the compact
is ratiﬁed by the two schools.
there will hardly be any to assert
that the pace has not bccn made
hot. The Athletic Union will
meet immediately after the mass
meeting adjourns.

Ithasbecnthoughtappropriate.
too, that an old-time enthusiasm
meeting be held hetore the track
team leaves for Des Moines.
There will be speeches galore,
tram faculty. alumni and students.
including members of the team.

state Tennis Tournament.

The Annual Intercollegiate
State Tournament. in which rcprer
sentatives from Cornell. Penn. S.
U. I. and Grinnell contested. was
held at Iowa City last Monday.
The courts were in ﬁne condition
and the weather exceptionally lar
vorablc for good tennis.

The preliminaries were run off
in the morning, and the atternoon
devoted to the ﬁnals. which were
the most closely contested match-
es in the history of the association.
In singles, Haddock, of S. U. 1..
after a ltardrfougltt battle ol ﬁve
sets. won out over Ellis. In this
match some of the ﬁnest tennis
ever played in Iowa courts was
exhiblted by both contestants.

The ﬁnal doubles were no less
exciting. In this match McIntosh
and Moore of Cornell dclcated
Hull and Weed of S. U. l.. after
ﬁve hotly contested sets. of which
the deciding one was ”79.

There was a good crowd or
spectators prescnt throughout the
attcrnoon, showing plainly that
tennis is not lacking enthusiastic
support at the University.

The state tournament is to he at
Grinnell next year, weather per-
mitting. and it is the hope of the
tennis association here that 2t
greater interest in this branch of
college athletics will be manifest
in the future.

The summary is as tollows:
