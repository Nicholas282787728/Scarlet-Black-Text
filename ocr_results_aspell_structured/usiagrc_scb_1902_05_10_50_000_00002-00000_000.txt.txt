THE LECTURES BY DR. WILLETT.

The attendance at the third
ture of the Willett course Wednes~
day evening was much better than
atthepreeedingones. Theiveath-
er was ﬁne. and this combined
with the interest in the lecturer
and his subject served to draw a
well ﬁlled houscr The subject for
the evening was Jesus' mlnlstry;
it was treated chronologically and
was divided by the lecturer into
three periods. the period of ob-
scurity, ot popularity, and or op-
position. The latter part was de
voted to the last scenes in Jesus'
life and work.

Another well ﬁlled house Thurs-
day evening attestedthc continued
interest in the course. The teach-
ings of Jesus was the theme, and
it was treated in the same clear
and interesting manner as usual.
Last night the lecture was held in
the chapel because of the exer-
cises in the church in connection
with the dedication of the Stewart
Library, In spite of the conl'llct
between the two meetings. the
chapel was well ﬁlled. though
largely with the college people.
The series will close tonight with
a discussion of the program of
Jesus. summing up with the re-
sults to be gained irom a study of
the life of Christ. The meeting
will be held in the church at the
usual hour of seven o'clock.

During the week the students
have been given as many oppors
tunitics as possible to come in Cons
tactwithDr.\Nil|ctt. Itwashoped
that he would conduct the chapel
exercises. but he felt that he must
devote the mornings to study in»
stead. However, he led the Frir
day morning services and gave a
most interesting talk on the rela
tion of Bible study to the college
curriculum. Thursday afternoon

ed to meet him personally were
givenan opportunityr A recep-
tion will be held after the lecture
this evening.

As to Mr. VVlllett himself, the
impression he has created during
the few days he has been in Grin»
hell is one of strength and power.
He is a scholar and a business man
combined. With none of the arts
of the orator, he yet held the
closest attention of his audiences.
His visit here cannot help but
have an inﬂuence for good upon
the college life. As was said be
fore. those who have missed the
opportunity of hearing him have
missed one of the best treats of
the whole college year.
