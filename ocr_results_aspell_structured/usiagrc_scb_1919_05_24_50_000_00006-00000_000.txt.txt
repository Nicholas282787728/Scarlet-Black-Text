RETURN UNGERTAIN

Arrival Before Commencement
Still Expected — To Leave
Armenia April 20?

Altlm no dednitc_ word has come
from president Main announcing the
date of his return it is still thought
that he ivill be in Gl'ilmell shortly be-
fore commencement

A letter was received sonic time ago
stating that D -llain had ordered
transportation from Paris for May 15.
but since no word has been received
from him it is thought that he is plan-
ning to temain in the Caucasus region
as long as possible beloio returning to
this countiy

Ed Hadley in a lecent letter to his
parents states that D1. Main expected
to leave Armenia about the 20th at
‘April, thus making it possible for him
to leave Paris not later than May 25.

President Main, in a letter to Mrs,
iiMain dated the last at March, Stated
that he hoped to be well on his way
home withing the next month, which
would indicate that he intended to
start from Armenia before the end of
April. If this is so he should be in
Paris sometime within the next few
days, and should arrive in Gl'innell

Within lhl‘ee weeks.

GRINN'ELL GRAD URGES
U. S. INTERVENTION IN
GOVERNMENT OF TURKEY

(Continued from Page One)
the League of Nations.
Mollmllmetlmlism l’lnys I’hrl’.

In commenting on tho inditlcrenoe
manifested by the nations of the world
toward the Turkish question, no stat-
od that no nation has cared to solve
the problem because no one nation
could get the. major portion or the
spoils. England, he said, altbo having
maintained the balance of power in
Tiirlicy for many years, sccms inv

,clincd to drop the matter at present

because she does not wish to incur the
enmity oi the Mohammcdans. These
people, even tho they hate the Turks,
are noL prepared to see them driiren

‘Ollt of Constantinople, and since such

.a large percontagc of England's sub-
jects are of the Mohammedan faith,

she is bcgiuning to withdraw hei dc-~l

mands that the Turks leave the otto-
man capital.

It England should assume virtual
control of Turkey, Great Britain
would control the whole world east
ot New York, according to Mr, Ryan.
Althu she might not misuse this now—
er, part or it should belong to Amer»
iea, he believes.

Discusses Young Turk Revolution

The Young Turk revolution in 1903
was not an attempt to improve the
government, he declared, but only
part of the foreign diplomatic game
in Europe whereby England, France
and Russia could manipulate affairs
to their own advantage, The business
of foreign diplomam in Europe for
hundreds or years has been to move
their respective governments into 1307
sitions of advantage and keep other
governments lrom moving into equally
advantageous positions. These three
governments combined, according to
M1. Ryan in order to help the Young

iTulhs get lid of Abdul Hamid, who

was a tool in the hands of Germany,
but the revolutionists ivcre purposely
kept ivcol: so that they could not got
the inside track in the government.
U. S. Intervention Acceph’illle.
_ “United States intervention in ‘Tlll'r
hey would probably be acceptable to
the whole world," declared Mr. Ryan
in closing. glNono oi the Balkan
states would be willing to have a
strong iEurollcan power take control,
so they would iavor it. All the nlliml
nations of Europe are suspicious or
cacti other, but.tbey have conddencc
in the United states and would abide
by her decisions. rlvcn Germany and
Austria would rather see America in
:cuntrol than any one elsc. Thc Unit- ‘
‘cd stoics navy could as well he nu~
choied in Tllllxlsll harbois to main.
tain o1der its in any othc'r ports and-
.the United Smtes could use Consiallv
ltillople as a distiibution point toi nll
the Mediterranean region,"

"After from thll'ty»ﬁve to ﬁfty years
of government by the United states,
the country could be turned over to
international control or given to
some of the more progressive people
at the country itself."
