QEhitntial

T is time to recognize that
football in Grinnell is in a
precarious condition. In another
column is a statement of the facts
of the team’s condition and pros-
pectst Something must be done
and done quickly ltthere is any
man in school who is able to get
out and try for the Learn and who
doesn’t do it, he is making a mis-
take. Better now than wait till
next year. This is the time when
men are wanted. There mm! be
astrong second team if there is
to he a strong 'Varsity, There
should be three full squads on the
ﬁeld. The men are in school,
why are they not out. Everyone
should realize that it he wants to
help, the time to do it is now and
the ﬁrst and most crying need is
for more men. It Coach Tratt
has the men he can develop a
team,butwithout material nothing
can be done It won't do to told
your hands and feel sorry that its
all true. The thing to do is to
get out and stop this slump.
Several men on the squad have
been obliged to quit training or
have quit voluntarily and some
one must take their places. There
must be more men at work. And
the team must have the united
support of the student body. It's
the team in hard luck. not the one
winning all its games, that needs
hearty and loyal support. Tile
team will put upa game ﬁght every
time but eleven men and a coach
can not supply the spirit that
makes a successful season.

ERHAFS it should be clear-
ly stated that the use of
the college seal and emblems in

advertising does not mean that
one ﬁrm is any more closely con-
nected with the college than
others. Their use, of calllse is
not really harmful, yet those who
have a love and reverence for
Iowa College feel almost as ifa
wrong were committed to see the
Chris/a DIM! of the seal scattmed
abroad on haildbills. For allto
use the emblems in this way would
be to rob them of their real slgnlﬁr
callce which lies not. so mucll in
their formal use or their careless
use as in the memories they bring
to the minds of those who have
spent years in the atmosphere of
Grinnell. Hence it is with regret
that we see the seal and emblem
used in promiscuous advertising.
CAMPUS XMPROVEMENT

For a small college, Griilnell
has a beautiful and well arranged
campus and it is always a pleasure
to get back to its smooth swat-d
and green trees after the summer

vacation. Plans are being laid for

still Iutther improvements of the

college grounds. Professor Buclr

has been surveying this week for
the new improvements. Mole
paths willbe laid out and trees
and shrubs will be p1anted.sothat
the space between Goodnow Hall
and the men's gymnasium will
have its shade.
