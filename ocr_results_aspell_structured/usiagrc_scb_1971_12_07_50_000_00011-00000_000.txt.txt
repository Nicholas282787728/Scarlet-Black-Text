real sense cfcommunity should have
no need to obtectify the qualities of
the instructor in this manner. My
sense of the situation now is that stue
dent questionnaires are to be used in
a negative way, as justification for
dismissing a man and asthe deciding
factor inaborderrline case; the pro
posed use of questionnaires does not
emphasize the improvement of the
academic community here. Rather,
it suggests that the way to improve
the Grinnell education is to dismiss
people and to hire other people. With
the current “buyers' market" I re-
cognize the real temptation to move
in this direction, but I do not thinka
new instructor will necessarily alle~
viate dissatisfaction.

Further, it seems to me that the
threat of questionnaires being used
in contracting could be extremely
demoralizing to faculty members.
The questionnaires seem to me the
reverse side of grading. We seem to
be moving toward asituation in which
student questionnaires can pose a
threat to a faculty member’s future
in the same way in which grades may
be construed to pose a threat to a
student’s future. I would not want to
see a situation of intimidation de-
velop.

I would like to see legitimate com—
plaints and suggestions directed to
ward the instructor and voiced by
the students whom a problem affects.
I feel that comments should be of
such a nature thata personis willing

to say or write them and attach his
name to them. l sincerely hope that
the Grinnell College communitywill
consider the implications -of the
questionnaires and will reconsider
their use,

To the Editors:

After reading the music reviews
written by Bill Conner, I am con-
vinced that you need a new critic.

Conner's positive criticism con-
tains no concrete evaluations. It is
nothing more than a list at compile
mentary adjectives. 'such as “good,”
"excellent," and "well done." This
becomes meaningless aiter a while,
since it says nothing about why
something is good, The result is a
tiring high schoollsh review which is
not at all useful as criti 'sm,
Conner’s negative criticism, al-
though somewhat better, is some—
times not justified. For instance, he
gave no justification for saying that
orchestra conductor David Mont-
gomery has “no stage presence",

Lastly, Connor’s reviews arewrit-
ten in a very high-handed manner.
His references to the women in the
opera review as “Miss-So—andeo”
sound stuffy and outofplace, as does
his overuse of ,such words as
”charming” and ”delightful.”

Among so many music majors,
surely the Son can choose someone
else to write reviews.

The Doppelt Effect

Whites ',' Awurie Of All Issue

by Jack Doppelt

So Why did the Concerned Black
Students (cos) occupy the library
and distribute a rhetorical manifesto
of “demands”?

It might help to examine the ration-
ale behind such a drastic maneuver.-
Let’s temporarily put aside any
complaints that rights were im-
pinged upon. Don't censure the maniv
festo because “when in the course of
human events" is such an absurd
prelude to any grievance, And let’s
even refrain from condemning the,
manifesto because the demanding
tone puts us aback.

Now comes the most difficult com-
promise, Let's pretend we are ob-
jective even sympathetic students
instead of the attacked Opposition.
That’s the toughest step That imr
plies forgetting that some of us last
four hours of library use. That
means neglecting the irony that
someone used a form of Civildiss
obedience AGAINST us.

Now, why did CBSgototheextreme
of taking over the library? After all,‘
that not only disrupted the adminis—
tratlon, but it also upset the stu-
dents. And near finals yet. Nowthey
won’t gain any support that way. That
will only polarize us. They should go
through the proper channels and pre-

by Barry Zigas

The following polemic has been lib»
erally liited from a hand—out I re»
ceived in my mail box last week. A
reliable source claims it was in its
turn lifted from an old Copy of“Afton-
bladet", one of Sweden’s major
nationwide evening dailies. The same
source says it was written by Sven
belblanc, a Swedish novelist and pro-
fessor. The translation is my own,

You may find it a little irrelevant

in placeseebut keep in mind it was
written here in Sweden, acountry
which is behind the USA in develop-
ment of its inner tensions. [hope to.
write about the reasons for this
calmer situation in later articles; for
now I merely presentthis short selec-
tion.

“COMRADESl

We live in a society where everything
can be exploited, corrupted and poi-
soned. Welive inasoclety where labor
is exploited and robbed of any human
value; where the hunger for profits
dirties the water we drink, the food We
eat, and the air we breathe; it even
drips its poisons into our mothers
milk. Everything can be exploited,
everything can be corrupted and pots
soned. This is why I beg you to be
suspicious.

Distrust the dim powers who try to
dictate your courses and study plans,
who will turn you into an underpaid
worker and loyal cog in the existing
social machine.

KNOWLEDGE IS POWER, they say.
But there are obviously powerful in-
terests who want to rob your
knowledge of its weapon, its striking
force, since this weapon could be a
threat to the “status quo".

What is the meaning of your stur
dies? is it only to land ahigh paying
job somewhere and lay down peace—
fully to the “good life” like some
well-fed pig in loyalty's sty?

No.

Your job is not primarily to get
technical or professional training,
your job is not to investigate and ex—
plore the worldreyour job is to
“change” the world! AND KEEP lN
MIND THAT YOUR KNOWLEDGE ls
WORTHLESS IF lT CANNOT SERVE
as A TOOL To OVERTHROW AND
SURPASS THE "STATUS QUO".

l beg you to be suspicious. And your
suspicions ,mustbe radical. They must
reach all the way down the roots ofthé
value judgements that steer and direct
the subyects that are pursued in your
schools. You must always question.
Who pays for scientific experiments,
and who profits from scientists’ dis-
coveries? What are the real values
that form the basis of sociology and
economy? What do historians work
withnthe people's history,or the 0p»
pressors’ history? Which literature
is accepted as worthy of scholarly
criticism, and on whatgrounds? and
where should psychiatry find rea-
sonahte criteria of mental health,
when psychiatry functions in a menr
tally sick society? How canitbethat
medical researchers can develop
enormously expensive heart transr
plant techniques when the same re
sources spent elsewhere could have
ended untold suffering from disease
in the Third World?

I implore you to distrust those who
will paint our society as an almost
problem-free community. Reality
speaks another language. Reality
speaks of a fermenting discontent,
which again and again bursts forth in
wildcat strikes.
powerlessness and alienation in this
society, powerlessness and alienar
tion which drive people into drug ade
diction’s false paradise and threatens
to turn our cities into slums. Such is
reality. And i beg you not to believe
those who try to gild this reality.

Don’t believe those who try to separ—
ate you from the working people. If
you have a message with meaning for
the masses, then it is your duty to
carry it to the people, carry it out

Reality tells of‘

of internal debate’s isolation. Isoe
lated from the people you are power
less. United with the people you have
power, power that none on earth can
withstand.

I beg you to mistrust. Mistrust those
who talk about togetherness, cooper-
ation, and constructive compromises.
Those who take such invitations seri-
ously are sinking their own boat. To
compromise with capitalism is to be
swallowed up by capitalism, I warn
you to mistrust the way of comproe
mise,

Distrust your own despair. I under-
stand that you often feel hopeless and
impotent, when your voices die away
without an echo, when the many who
are sleeping refuse to wake up. Per-
haps you are tempted then to listen
to the advocates of nihilism and hope:
lessness in the world ofliterature and
philosophy. you read authors and
poets who articulately protest man-
kind‘s evil, who while that evil is in
man’s nature, that history is an ab-
surd and unintelligible inferno. And
for this articulate despair authors re-
ceive .Nobel prizes, and academic

chairs, because they serve the exist~'

ing society's interests. You must not
believe these prophets of doom; you
must refute and dispense with them.
People are not apes, they are social
creatures, whothemselves canchange
their environment.

1 suggest you think or the people of
Southeast Asia who this moment fight
for their freedom. Up against the most
powerful military machine in the
world, they had every reason to give
up hope, but they refused to despair,
they have made the impossible pos-
sible, and they have done it thanks to
their unquenchable belief in revolu—
tion’s red wave and in solidarity
among people. ‘

l beg you to take these people as
your example, " ‘

Although Delhland wrote this article
for Swedish students, it has no less
relevancy for us at Grinnell. Thtnk

all of you who quit politics when the
war did not end after your intensive
summer following Cambodia. Think
about it, you folks who last year
bitched about a dornothing student
senate which sat in front of an empty
South Lounge week after week. Think
about it when you get ready to speed
for a week so that you can linish eight
papers and four take-homes and go
home for Christmas

Like the man says, we can change
our environment. And the tools are
sitting in Burling, if we look forthem.
The question is, are we going to see
them, examine them and put them back
on the shell, or are we going to pick
them up and use them?

sent their requests to the adminis~
tration. Then it we agree with their
grievances, we can actively support
them.

Well, Citizens, that's what they’ve
been doing tor a long time now. And
they are making progress...with the
administration. They’ve gotten al-
most no active support from those of
us who sympathize with the grie-
vances.

Now There is static

When a CBS representative was
placed on the EPC committee, 1
wrote a column stating how ludicrous
an ethnic representative on an edu-
cational policy committee struck
me. Over a month later, students
complained that they had no say in
the matter. We didn’t even know un-
til the votes were cast that we could
support or condemn it. We weren't
even cognizant of an issue,

That can happen when you go
through proper channels. There's no
static and no one, especially atGrin-
hell, would bother acting,

well now there’s static. Now we are
aware of an issue. One that has gone
through proper channels many
times. But we were never affected.
It had never stopped us from study-
ing for four hours before. We let
the administration handle it and
complained later,

That's why occupying the library
served a double purpose.lt again
displayed to the administration the
need to right some glaring social and
cultural inadequacies. But more im-
minent, it forced the rest ofus toget
involved in a situation that will affect
us soon enough anyway.

Out lo the Open

Would it have been easier for us to
continue uninvormed about revised
admissions procedures and then dis-
cover that "there seem to be a lot
more blacks on campus this year"?
Or should we be confronted with
knowledge of a trend to recruit and
admit more black students?

It reminds me of the revelation of
the public when the Pentagon papers
were disclosed. The public had been
informed about 90% of the contentof
the papers previously, but until the

public got it right in the lace, they
feigned ignorance.

All of us should be aware that ad»
mission policy plans to recruit more
black students and Iowa students, and
faculty hiring has set its goal to in-
crease black and women faculty
members, Setting the present goal
at 200 black students, as stated in
demand one, should not have aston-
ished anyone.

That’s why our library was the ve—
hicle. If anything, we should be
grateful that the situation is out in
the open, Pandora style. If the re-
sentment stems from knowledge of
the goals instead of from ignorant
heresay, at least the black students
will know the true feelings of the
other students. And if thesefeelings
reﬂect the immediate reaction ofthe
students as of last Monday, I fear
an understanding schism that will
demand segregation as a remedy.

Why Not Before?

The defensive attitude of the stu-
dents was quite evident. The reaction
to the demand for an optional board
plan for the black students was met
with “why should they not haveto be
on board plan? Saga food is notpro—
moting my surVival either.”

This merely represents an agree
ment with the demand andaiealousy
that they should have rights wedon’t
have yet. As a black told me, “you
want your rights, go fightforthem."
In the truest tradition of our court
system, the black students may be
setting the precedent for a change
in all board plans.

it just might be more profitable to
put aside the criticisms of the spe-
cific demands and determine why it
took us so long to realize that CBS
felt the need for such changes. If
we were aware. why didn’t we con-
front the issue before?

It' I have misrepresented any side
of the issue, please forgive me. I
wasn’t allowed into any of the closed
meetings which clarified the speci~
flc demands. Also, as i have been
told, I am a middlerclass white and
couldn’t possibly understand. And
the disgusting thing about it is that
it’s partially true.

Washington Correspondence

Proxmire 0n Mid-East

by Curt Gorrell

The tragedy of the Indian-Pakistani
conﬂict dominates headllnes today,
but world attention is also being
focused on the Middle East once'
again. New tensions are rising there,
as exemplified by the recent address
by Egypt’s President Anwar Sadat
stating that Egypt would fight to re-
cover the Sinai.

in view of this developing crisis,
comments this author recently re
corded made by an influential meme
ber of the U S Senate, Senator Wil-
liam Proxmire, might be oiinterest
to SlfB readers.

Senator Proxmlre, best known in
recent times for his leadership in
opposing the controversial SST pro-
gram and LOOkheed loan bill, also
has taken a firm and definite stand
on the subject of American policy
with regard to Israel.

“I believe very strongly that we
should support the Israeli cause.”

Bus'ness Manager

Applications for the position of
Business Manager for the 5&8
for second semester can now be
submitted to the Committee on
Publications.

Al Schoene is resigning as Euse
iness Manager aiter this semess
ter, after two semesters of sore
vice, Anyone with questions
should Contact Mr. Hottois.
Applications should be given to
Mr. Hottois by Thursday noon.

The Scarlet and Block

”Israel is a democracy. It is the
only democracy in the Middle East,
and it’s a true working democracy.
They say that 'any time two lsraelis
get together you are liable to end up
with three political parties. One for
each of them and thenapompromise
party to try and work out their difv
ferences.” '

To those critics who feel that ma»
terial support for Israel might lead
the United States into ”another Viet-
nam" predicament, Proxmire ex-
presses his disagreement.

”Unlike South Vietnam this is a
genuine bastion of democracy. Un»
like South Vietnam this is agovern-
ment that enyoys the support oi its
people. Unlike South Vietnam this is
a country that can stand on its own
feet...fact is‘that Israel has never
asked the u s to provide one soldier,
one advisor, one pilot ,_ notasingie
one of the military personnel has
ever been requested.”

The Senate recently approved $500
million in arms credits for Israel,
earmarking half of that for Phantom
fighter-bombers which Israel has
been requesting and Proxmire voted
in favor of this amendment. But the
Senator realizes that armaments are
not the key to peace in the Middle
East. Rather, he hopes that if an
arms balance can be maintained,
then neither side will pursue their
goals by war, but seek them through
negotiations.

“The arms racethat is takingplace
,.,is as futile as it is dangerous.
Clearly the only genuine hope for
lasting peace lies in negotiations..."
