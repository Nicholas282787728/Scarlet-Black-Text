Thursday‘s chapel talk by Dean J. s.
Nullen centered around his recent ex-
perience or witnes 'ng an election of
parliament members in Italy. Accord—
ing to Dean Nolleii the election or a
parliament thore causes more evcite»
iiicnt than the election of a president
here. The walks or Rome are sten-
ciled by the enthusiasts and posters
adorn even the churches. \Vith the
recent participation oi the church and
the forming ot the catholic party the
power could be held by the socialist
and Catholic p. ties but these parties
icau never agree. They will some day
clash, according to Dean Nollcn, and

thought for a review or the histoiy of
those same hobbies. History, we are
inclined to believe, is a. good subject
for classroom consideration, but a
very dry, stupid method of spending
one's time under other circumstances,
However, it is sometimes interestingt‘
to take “a day off", and consider the‘
primary stages or our major activities.
Today, we are so busily engaged in!
supporting our athletic teams that we,
do not remember that a product sol
powerful was once a spindling in need
oi every attention. So successful has,
Grinnell been in her athletic career, so}
whole-hearted has been the support oi
the student body and iaculty, that it ist
hard to realize that she has not always
maintained such a reputation. How-
ever, athletics, in their present form:
are comparatively young and it is to
celebrate the near completion 0[ their
thirty-ﬁrst year in Grinnell College
that this brief review is presented. .
In the tail of 1889, at a state con»
vention of the Young Men's Christian
Association, at ottninwa, plans were
discussed [or the iormation oi an Iowa
Athletic Association which should eni-
brace all the colleges and univer ties
in the state. Tentative plans were
adopted at this time zlntl committees
were selected for the continuation or
the work. 'In 1850, at a meeting or
the state oratoi-ical association which
was held at Mount Pleasant early in
February or that year, unal arrange
ments were made and the Iowa Athe
letic Association became a. reality.
From that organization, tostered by
the two oldest college activities in the
state, have sprung the many comer—
which today
dominate and maintain organized ath-

ences and associations

letlcs in all of our schools, both pri»
mary and advanced.
However, with the extension of the

college, and the increase ol activities,

has come it Wldel', not Separation, hut
indifference to any phase of campus
life other than that ill which each stue

we ﬁnd that our once coordinated stur

cinc interest. It is"'entirely possible
that each activity, jealous or its- owni
growth, has been at iault in varying
degree. It is galso possible that there
should be complete harmony and
unity of purpose among all, for, in the
ﬁnal analysis, all are related thru
origin. Thus, altho the participants in.

Banks, even though they solicit the
student accounts, are continually
troubled with overdrawn accounts,
This is not intentional in most cases,‘
and the banks know it, but they cause
as much work in sending out notices
as it the overdratt had been a large
one. To honor cheeks when there are
not enough iunds to cover them, is a
direct violation or the state banking
laws, but because of the special class
of people the banks here serve, they
usually honor student checks and send
out notices to students to cover the
overdratt. It is not right to ask this
of the banks, especially when the ac
counts are so small that it costs them
nearly as much to handle them as
they can earn out et the money de-
posited.

Unpaid accounts with local mer-
chants, and those allowed to run for
many months, would also make a. large,
sum it added together. Class organi-
zations and clubs andrlitemry socir
eties are especially to be criticised tor
their business methods. Many class
accounts are carried for two or three
years before they are paid. Literary
society accounts are in the same class
and should not he allowed at the pres-
ent method. Many individual students
with small accounts can also be criti-
cised. Merchants inust stretch the
rules or the credit exchange tar be-
yond their legitimate limits to accolnr
incdntc the students, and this should

not be asked.

Not: much substantial progress can be made in chemical and elec-

They use the X-Ray tube as if it were a machine-gun; for by

its means electrons are shot at; targets in new ways so as to reveal more
about the structure of matter.

As the result of such experiments, the X-Ray tube has been greatly

improved and the vacuum tube, now so indispensable in-radio com~
munication, has been developed into a kind of trigger device for guid-
ing electrons by radio waves.

Years may thus be spent in what seems to be merely a purely
