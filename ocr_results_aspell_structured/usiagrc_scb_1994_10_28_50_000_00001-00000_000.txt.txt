RINNELL College sopho
G more Dan Eslinger was at-
tacked by a carloadof teen-
agersSunday nightwhile he and three
friends were walking along Park
Street Eslinger was struckirt the calf
with a baseball hat. He was taken to
Grinnell General Hospital, where he
was treated for minor injuries and
released.

One juvenile has confessed to
the beating and is being charged with
willful injury andaggravatedassault.
He is currently being held at a juver
nile detention center. Two other par-
ticipants have not yet been charged

Theattackoccurredat 10:1 5pm.
Sunday as Eslinger and friends were
walking back to North Campus after
carving jack-o-lantems.

“We were walking sort of in the
street,” Eslinger said. “There was a
car accelerating behind us. I was in
frontofthcgroupand theonc furthest
out in the streetand closest to the car.
As the car droveby. they stuck out an
aluminum baseball batand struck me
in the calf."

Eslingcr’s friends immediately
called me ambulance. At the hospi-
tal, about " ISpeople" including Dean
of Student Affairs Tom Crady and
Eslinger‘s RLC and SA, showed up
to make sure he was alright

Eslinger was badly bruised. but
otherwise not seriously injured, He
used crutches, he said, for a few days

 

toalleviate thestresson the bad bniise.

Eslingerand friends wcreable to
give a sketchy description of the car
to the police, which, two days later,
on Tuesday. led to identiﬁcation of
the assilants and a confession.

“The descriptions [of the car]
were enough forourofﬁcers to match
them up with [the car of] someone
from the town who has been known
around the department before," Ofﬁ-
cer Fred Oster said. “We located the
car. lookedinside, and found the base-
ball bat.”

The juvenile being charged with
aggravated assault will probablyonly
receive probation for his actions, ac-

cording to Oster.

“The laws in Iowa are pretty
liberal," he said. “It is in no way a
reﬂection on the Grinnell Police De-
partment but on our court system. I
remember a case I was investigating
in 1990. A former college student
attackedacurrentcollegestudentand
was charged with assault with an
attempt to commit sexual abuse,
which is a felony and is very serious.
He only got probation."
Occurences before

Oster said that Eslinger’s attack
was not a rare occurrence.

“There are confrontations be-
tween college students and towns»

people," he said. “This one just hap-
pened to be more violent than mosL"

Crady said that attacks occur “a
couple of times 3 yeah” Eslinger's
attack is the first one he knows abut
this year.

“Obviously, we are very con-
cerned," he said. “We really need to
make sure that we have good com-
munication with the police. These
things need to be reported immedi-
ately so that we can let students know
and the town know.”

Crady said that students can pro—
tect themselves by using the campus
escort service at night and by travel-
lirtg in groups. If a student is as-

saulted, Student Affairs and the Po—
lice shouldbecontactedimmediately
so am the attacker can be found,
Crady said.

“It’seasy tothirtk that inasmall
town things like this don't happen,"
he said. “Students still need to be
careful.”

Eslinger positive

Eslinger said thatbeing attacked
does not change his positive view of
Grinnell.

"This wasafreak event,"hesaid.
“There was enough lighting dewas
with people. I‘m pretty satified
with how the college handled ev-

ERMANY’S unification,

Germans agree that bringin gthecoun-

countries as the old East and West
Germanies have

Germany. This plan, he said, is al~
ready being implemented to some
extent.

The German workforce has been
aided, in pan, by a shortened work
week The average Germany busi-
ncssman works between 30 to 35
hours per week in contrast with the
40 worked by Americans, he said.
The shortened work week serves to
provide more jobs Spiessaid that the

spoke on the

topic of Germany's economy as well
as other topics in a series of lectures
and infomal discussions this week.
Spies is the managing director of
Tragergesellschaft Schiftbau, a
consultancy and holding company
based in Rosteck, Germany.

Many of the problems Germany
faces, said Spies, deal with the re-
structuring of the economy, includ
ing the tax and insurance systems of
eastern Germany, which before the
uniﬁcation was vastly different from
the western system.

Spies presented several possible
solutions to Germany’s economic
problems. One possible solution to
Germany’s woes,he said,isthe trans-

is a worker who
likes his job, will perform better as a
result of a higher standard of living
and who will not “bum out,” he said.

As important as the economy is,
though,Spiesismore emphatic about
environmental issues.

Reycling is an issue he feels
Germany urgently needs to address.
He said that although Germany is
technologically up to pace with the
mt of Europe, the country's recy»
cling initiatives and business incen-
tives are quite lacking.

Spies cited the example of the
German automobile industry. Typi-
cally, he said.Gerrnan auto manufac
