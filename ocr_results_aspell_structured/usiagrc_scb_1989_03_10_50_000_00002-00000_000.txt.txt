Students denounce increase

by Kim Eckart

The 7.5»percent increase in
tuition for the 1989-90 academic
year will raise the comprehensive
fee to $15,088. This increase,
consistent with increases of past
years. has prompted many ques»
tions from anxious students.

According to President
George Drake, in a letter sent to
all students and parents, the rise
in the comprehensive fee enables
Grinnell to provide a quality edu-
cation and services at a total cost
of less than that of Grinnell’s
peer colleges.

Some students believe tltc
increase appears to be Grinnell’s
attempt to further compete with
other libcmlrarts Colleges, such as
Carleton. “I understand that our
tuition is still lower than other
colleges of a comparable level,
but I'm concerned that the tuition
is being increased merely to my
crease our prestige," said Josh
Salwen.

However, Drake maintains
that prestige is not a concern.
Other colleges (including Carr
icton) have raised their tuition for
the 198990 academic year by a
larger percentage than Grinnell.
“If it were done for prestige. then
we’re losing the race," Drake
said.

Grinnell‘s $250 million
endowment is also a factor in
student protests. “The tuition
has gone up every year since I’ve
been here. It’s indefensible to
raise our tuition $1000 a year and
not do anything with it. We
have the largest endowment in
the country, and we’re investing
it, playing the market,“ said one
senior.

Although the endowment
creates income, some money
must be invested in order to keep
up with inflation. This still
leaves a high percentage for
institutional improvements and
student needs, Drake said. “We' re
spending about $400 tnore per
student,” said Drake.

Some students question the
existence of the promised im-
provements. “I'd like a better rcr
turn on my investment. like a
doctor on campus or more fac-
ulty," said Paul Russell.

Drake maintains that college
expenditures go directly toward

such areas as an increased number
of faculty and faculty salaries,
computer services, career dcvclr
opment, and other beneﬁcial ser-
vices. “The students may not see
these because they are incremen-
tal improvements.” Drake said.
Yet many students are tnost
concerned with the adjustmean to
financial aid. “11' tuition is ad

justed with financial aid, then
why don’t they just leave the tur
ition alone and not raise the fir
nancial aid? What kind of
'adjustments' are they making to
ﬁnancial aid?" asked a freshman.

Director of Financial Aid
James Lincoln explained the 15-
sue. “An increase in the
comprehensive fee results in an
increase in the budget that is used
to determine financial need for all
students." said Lincoln. Since
financial aid vanes from year to
year due to changes in parental
income, assets, family size, and
number of college students, fir
nancial need determines the
amount of ﬁnancial aid awarded.

President Drake commented
on the overall increase. “We’vc
chosen to run a pretty expcnsivc
program,” he said, “but with the
quality of the education and scrr
vices we provide, it shows we
aren't exploiting anyone."

Asian-Americans work
to shatter stereotypes

by Bruce Emond

For several years, Asian
Americans occupied a difficult,
nondcscript position on the Grin-
nell campus and were caught be-
tween others’ perceptions of their
ethnic and cultural heritage and
their own American upbringings.
With the formation of All Stu~
dents interested in Asia (ASIA)
last year, AsianrAmericans arc fir
nally coming into their own as a
campus group. The outlook for
the group is extremely posttive.
An AsianrAmerican symposrum
is slated for next fall and other
events are in tile works.

In the past, ASlA attempted
to devise a special-topic course on
AsianrAmericans, but it was
swamped by bureaucratic wranr
gling. After two Grinnell stu-
dents attended an AsianrAmcriean
symposium at Oberlin College
last year, they spoke to several
speakers about organizing a
course at Grinncll. They ape
proached Donald lrving, then
associate dean of the faculty,
about the special-topic course
but, according to the students
who met with him, he was not
supportive. "We tried to propose
a course dealing 'with Asian-
Ar‘nericans but he [Irving] did not
feel there was enough interest on
campus," said Reimi Tsuru, a
member of ASIA. "He basically
wanted to go by the book. He
was looking at it just from the
administrative level."

Now with irving on sabbati-
cal and with the pledge of Eric
Wynn, the new minority-affairs
director, to support the sympo-
sium, prospects look good.
"Every ofﬁce we have approached
has been extremely enthusiastic
and cooperative. President Drake
was especially generous," said
Nara Takakawa, another member
of ASIA.

The symposium will focus on
unique issues affecting Asianr
Americans. A particular problem
for AsianAAmericans is that their
American heritage is often over,
looked and they are assumed to be
"foreign.” Takakawa believes this
partially stems from their suc-
cessful assimilation into Ameri
can culture, but. she added, “We
still are not white." She remem-
bers when she first came m Grinr
nell she was often assumed to be

a foreign student. "People would
say to me, ‘Your English is so
good. You don't have any ac-
cent."‘ Senior Naomi Kumano,

who. like Tsum and Takakawa,
comes from Hawaii, encounterctl
similar preconceptions. "My
freshntan roommates asked me if
1 could speak English. Then they
asked me if 1 spoke Hawaiian,
which is a dead language." site
said.

Mayalee Chai. who was born
and raised in the United States.
was asked for a 'green card,‘ which
indicates pcrmltncntvrcsidenl
status for aliens, wlten site
applied at the Job Center in
Grinncll. Even after Chai showed
them her Social Security card the
employees still asked her it she
had a green card "When you first
encounter people and you’re not
while they don‘t even consider
you American." Chai said.

Although she sees less of it at
Grinnell where "everyone study:
hard," Takukawa stated there is a
stereotype of the AsianrAmcrican
"study geek." She attributes this
to the emphasis on education in
many Asian cultures. "Asians
came to die U.S., and every gen-
eration climbed a little higher up
the ladder, One of the reasons for
this is that you are expected to do
-your - homework .and to study
-weii," stated Takakawa.

Chai recounted how a clash of
EastrWest values occurred within
her own family. "My Chinese
grandparents came over to see me
when I was born and they started
discussing what colleges I would
go to. My American mother
said, ‘How can you talk about
colleges when she is just a
babyT"

Because of their successful
assimilation into American soci-
ety, Asian-Americans have been
dubbed the "model minority."
One major weekly news magazine
ran a cover article touting the
academic achievements of "Asian
whiz kids" and used this as [0512A
merit to the model-minority label.
Chai views such categorization as
"damaging. People don‘t look at
Asian-Americans as individuals."
She also believes that stereotyp-
ing Asian-Americans discounts
.problcms within their com—
munities. She explained. "The
whole model minority myth ig-
nores the problems of Southeast
Asians in the coastal areas." Kur
mano agreed: "in a way they are
positive stereotypes, but they are
still categorizing us. It puts
pressure on Asian-Americans."
