rolled at Grinnell College this year as a first-year but withdrew
Feb. 26th, after the vandalism occurred earlier this semester.

Cliierofrolrce Jody Matherly said that, if Greg Rosic were
tried and found guilty, the sentencing would be left entirely to
the court. Greg Rosie faces a charge chriminal Misehiefin the
fourth degree, which is punishable by up to a year in prison and
a fine ofbctween $250 and $1500,

Tire vandalism in question would normally be cited as Crime
inal Mischief in the fifth degree which applies to damage of
$200 oi less, But according to Iowa Law, a Criminal Mischief
charge that can be classified as a Hate Crime automatically has

crime which also raised it to a fourth degree charge.

“It’s under the state charge for hate crime," said Matherly.

ing propertyiand it’s based on the person’s sexual oriennttron
it’s a hate crime."

counsel to contest any charge “ flie's been charged, we're going
to hire a criminal lawyer,” he said. “He's going to plead not guilty
and the people who charged him are going to have to testify to
the amount ot’tlre damage."

Cameras installed in mailroom, security questions raised

Decision by Student Affairs runs counter to desires by Joint Board that students be consulted before installation

BY SARAH MlRK

Over spring Break, Campus Security and
Student Affairs installed two security cameras
in the post ofﬁce as part of the ongoing investi»
gation into the homopho-
bic acts that shook the
campus in February. While
Joint Board members had
expressed a desire to be his
volved in any decision on
camera placement. admins
isrrators say there was an
urgenr need to install the
cameras without consult»
ing Joint Board given the »
nature of the ongoing in-
vestigation.

The installation of the
cameras comes two weeks '
after Joint Board ratified
a campus security camera
policy followi g two years
of debate on the issue.
V|CC President of Student
Affairs Jan Koszewski ’08
led the committee which,
along with the help ofjoint Board senators and
Security Officers Stephen Btiseoc and Amy
Coleman, drafted the school policy icquiring
consultation of Joint Board before the institllar

good have to review and
ratify it before it becomes
official policy.

Other aspects of the
as—yet~unofftcial policy
include mandating that
Security post signs next to
each camera notifying stur
doors that they are under
surveillancc and requiring
that the tapes be viewed
only after a crime may
have occurred.

Interim Vice President
of Strident Affairs Elena
Bernitl ‘94 stressed that the
installation ofthe cameras
over break had norhuig
to do with avoiding stir
dent input. instead, Bert
nal explained that Security and student Affairs
believed for contidenrial reasons pertaining to
the hate crimes investigation that the cameras
needed to be installed immediately, saying only,
“This d ‘lSlOl‘i n d to be made,"

when and if they will be retrieved and who
monitors them is all confidential information
which Student Affairs and Security cannot dis
cuss until thc investigation concludes.

The homophobic acts in February, wherein
an unknown person mailed derogatory letters
to 34 members of Gririnell’s queer commu-
rtity via the campus post ofﬁce,
highlight for Barnal the coin-
plicated, personal and profound
issues surrounding installation
of cameras. “This is a trement
dous opportunity for students
to walk away ﬁnettuning a
policy that is as ‘real world’ as
it gets," said interim Vice I’resir
dent of Student Affairs Elena
Berrial '94, “We can’t just have
the knee-icrk, ‘Big Brorher’ re-
action."

Though Student Affaiis did not inform all
of SGA or the student body of the recent instalr
lations, Koszcivski said that ha feels the admins
istmtors involved in security camera policy are
“sympathetic to the spirit of the policyLsun
dents haying major influence over the decision

“The at ng sucks, in that wc’ve expressed
the desire for sntdcnt input over camera instal-
lation,but the olrcy isn‘t ofﬁcial,"said Koszcwr

can fault them given the nature and severity of
the situation." And while he's nervous about
potential abuse ofcmcrgcncy circumstances to
justify installation of cameras withour student
input, Koszcwski believes that in any circum-
stance, students safety must come first. “If the
policy was already on record, I would be out-
raged right now and i would
certainly feel violated. But it’s
different right now, given the
nature of the investigation."

“[The hate crimes] bring
up that can-rem policy should
be thought ofless as a poten-
tial Big Brother and more ofas
the intersection between Big
Brother and student security,"
said Bernal.

For Bernal, the key to
quelling unproductive debate
between students and administrators over the
potentially divisive issues orivhcthcr and whcrc
cameras should be installed is creating a solid
camera policy. ‘* A cohesive policy built by stut
dents and administrators would nccd to address
how to respond to both routine desires for more
security and true ency situations such as vio-
lent or hateﬁll crirncs,"said Bernal,

“It is really easy to tear policies or decisions
apart hilt much more difficult to build them
back up,” said Bernal. “The hard part is to get
orfthc soapbox and make a good policy."
