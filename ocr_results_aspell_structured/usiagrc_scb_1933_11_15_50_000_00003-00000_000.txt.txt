House Officers Authorize
All Solicitors, Dean States

That no agents receive permission
from the dean of men to solicit or-
ders or exhibit their wares in the
men's dormitories, and that such so—
licitors are referred to house offi-
cers for permission to appear on the
first floors of the haus, was the
statement sent by Dean Shelton L,
Beatty to hall presidents, house
mothers, and house coiincilors yesA
terday.

"Several solicitors recently have
falsely told men in various halls that
they have received permission from
the dean of men for them to solicit
orders or show their wares," Dean
Beatty stated. “The dean never
gives that permission to anyone. it
is strictly a building or hail right
'and responsibility.

“The dean always refers solicitors
to the house officers, and warns the
solicitor that in no case will any
house officer give permission for the
agent to go from floor to floor or
room to room. He must remain on
first ﬂoor."

Bishop Howden Addresses
Congregation at Vespers

“Development of a higher per-son-
ality is one of the greatest contribu~
tions we can make to our country,"
declared the Right Rev. Frederick
13. Howden, Bishop of the Episco-
palian church of Albuquerque, N. M,
in his address at vespcrs Sunday.

He showed how the dual characV
ter of Simon clearly exemplifies the
development of a human personality,
“First we saw Simon by the take as
a crude person but by his prophetic
vision he developed his individuality,”
Bishop Howden remarked. “From
him we can all pattern our own
lives.”

Heredity is a real force in moral‘

and physical tciidenci , the speaker
admitted. He continued with the
opinion that, although environment
plays a large part in development.
“It is a thousand times more impor-
tant than having a wonderful mother
or a wonderful schoolmaster, to pos-
scss moral and spiritual aspirations.”
