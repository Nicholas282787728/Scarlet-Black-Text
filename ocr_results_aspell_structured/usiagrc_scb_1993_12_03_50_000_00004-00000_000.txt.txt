Sharples & Mabon Say A Perfect World
Is A Perfect Waste of Time and Money

By Riva Sharples
and Bill Mabon

— RIVA'S thwi

HE movieA Perfect World
I is touted as an “action
drama," but full of action
itis not. The movie is slow paced,
inconsistent, and worstofall, un-
interesting, The characters are
undeveloped and flat; the plot,
what little there is ofit, is stereo-
typical and boring and viewers
find themselveshoping the movie
will end quickly.

Theﬁlmissetin theearly 19605.
Kevin Costner plays Butch, a con
victwhobreaksoutofjajl,andwhile
trying to secure the perfect Ford get-
away car, takes a six-year old boy
hostage. Mostofthe movie consists
of trite, uninteresting conversations
between the boy and Costner while
they travel leisurely down country
roads in Texas. The conversations

aresupposeti to be touching and draa
made, but are so predictable and
meaninglessthatviewers could care
less if Costner and the boy have
bonded.

The movie is extremely uh.
realistic. Costner’s break from
jail is obviously phoney, and the
[act that he can elude the police
while driving slowly down couna
try roads talkirig to a kid is
unbelieveable. A Perfect Worlds
biggest flaw is the inconsistency
ofCostner’scharacter,who origi-
nally seems the movie’s only pos
sible salvation.

Acting in A Perfect Warldis
shoddy at best. Clint Eastwood,
who portrays a tough weathered
small-town cop, does the best he
can saddled with bad lines and a
sickeningly stereotypical charac-
ter, Laura Dern, who plays a
specialist in fugitive apprehenr
sion, does a perfectly awful job
of portraying a woman not taken
seriously in a man‘s world.

Escape Cold Weather at
Javanese Ensemble Concert

By April Shaw

NYONE wanung to escape
the cold weather and enter
the tropical atmosphere of

the Indonesian island of Java can
attend the eighteenamember Grinncll
College Javanese Music and Dance
Ensemble Concert, which will be
performed at 4:30 pm. in Roberts
Theatre on Thursday, Dec. 9.

Theprogram, directed by Associa
ate Professor of Music Roger Vetter
and Assistant of Music Valerie Mau
Vetter, will include four sets: two fear
luring the gamelan (orchestra) and two
displaying dance. While the two sets
involving the gamelan are without
dance accompaniment, the music wn
arranged to accompany puppetry or
dance.

One of the dance sets is a training
dance reﬂecting the Strong male style,
almough all of the dancers are women.

This is not unusual in Javanese dance,
however, since gender roles are often
switched. The other is a solo dance in
which Matt Vetter will portray the
refined male style. While there is no
story behind it, the character repre-
sents a young man captivated by him-
self and an authentic costume will be
worn to complete the desired effect.

According to R. Vetter, a concert
performance of J avanesemusicisvery
rare in Java. ”There aren‘tconcerts of
music inJava, instead it(themusic and
dance) is performed for an important
occasion or eventthatneedsmusic and
dance." Weddings or government in
augurations are examples of these
events,

The ensemble has expanded to
twenty-five participants for the con-
cert, featuring 18 musicians and seven
dancers. The concert, which is pre—
sented by the DepamnentofMusic, is
expected to last 45 minutes.

Costner‘s performance is the
most surprising and enjoyable of
the movie, which isn’t saying
much.

Allin all,A Perfect Warldis
a movie to be avoided, If you
really think you must see it, save
your money, and wait until it
comes out as a 99 cent video.

MOVIE REVIEW

A Perfect World
Riva: at (outof4)
Bill: * 1/2

— BILL‘S VIEW#

Unforgiven: BANG; In the
Line of Fire: BANG: A Perfect
World: CLICK. Unfortunately
Clint Eastwood cannot hit the
mark three films in a row.

A Perfect World is confined
conceptually,just as Eastwood‘s
character, Texas Ranger Red
Garneu,is confined toacramped
recreational vehicle for most of
the movie. Eastwood, who die
rectedthcpicture, is on the screen
for a dissapointingly short
amount of time.

Set in 1963, prison escapee
Butch Haynes (Kevin Costner)

takes Philip (TJ. Lowenthal),
young Jehovah’s Witness, hos
tage.

Alarmed by the incident be
cause it is an election year, th
Governor of Texas sends Red l
capture the convict and save th
boy. However. the film’s focu
is the relationship between Butc
and Philip, who become friends

Much is made out of the fac
that Butch was sent to juvenil-
prison by Red as a teenager an-
became a more dangerous crimi
nal as a result. Eastwood play,
up the ambiguous moral natur
of the criminal and the law in thi
story, but with much less succes
than in Unforgiven. The bes
parts of the movie are the comi
scenes when Butch and the be
are raising hell.

Costner does unusually goo:
work, and is the bright point 0
the film. He is so relaxed one ha
the sense that he is on a road trit
instead of fleeing justice.

However, A Perfect War!
as a whole lacks a clear vision
In light of Eastwood’s rccen
good work one leaves the theate

especially dissatisfied If vo_
insist on seeing it wait until in
on video.
