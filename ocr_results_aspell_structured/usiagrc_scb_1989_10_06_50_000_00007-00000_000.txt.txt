Ethnic Studies — a Desperate Need We Dared Imagme a World

 

To the Editor:

Last week, the Asian-American
symposium brought up some impor-
tant questions about incorporating
emnic studies into existing classes.
It was mentioned that some teachers
were wondering why various ethnic
minority student groups are becom-
ing so vocal.

What the students are saying is
that we need a curriculum that re-
ﬂects the realities of ethnic diversity
of the campus and the problems of
racism and invisibility that all mi-
norities have to live with,

On many occasions on campus
andin town [havebeen asked, “What
country are you from?" I‘m kind of
tired of people assuming this when I
was born in Philadelphia and live in
New York.

The curriculum has many gaps
that specifically concern Asian
Amencansandshouldbeaddressed,
The college has a growing Asian
studies program and an American
studies department but there is no
connection between the two. If that
is the case, how did I get here and
why doI exist? In American history,
Asians only show up twice: during
the building of the Trans Continen-
tal Railroad and the Japanese Intem-
ment camps in World War II.

It was suggested that the students
are angry, but I think frustrated is

more the case. After this year, an
Asian-American, Latin American

and a multicultural symposium will
have taken place. These symposi—
ums arearequest that the school pay
attention to our needs.

In the end, itcould only be benefi-
cial to the college. Including ethnic
studies in the curriculum would be
another way to draw more minority
students to Grinnell.

In his convocation address, Ron
Takaki mentioned that schools such
as the University of Minnesota and
Wisconsin have ethnic studies re—
quirements even though they areover
95 percent white. They require it
because as national school, their
graduatesdon'tstay in-state and they

want them to have knowledge of the
ethnic diversity in America. It al-
most sounds like Grinnell, but not
quite.

It is important for all student
minority groups to use the momen-
tum of the symposiumstoprcss fora
permanent change in the curriculum
as an ultimate goal. As racial vio-
lence and ethnic diversity increase
around the US. and on campus, I
think thateducational institutions like
Grinnell should not be ignorant of
ethnic studies any longer, The world
is changing and this college should
reﬂect me students' needs.

The Inv ible

Symposium

 

To the Editor:

I Want to express my disappoint-
ment in the S & B’s lack of coverage
on Grinnell’s first-ever Asian—
American symposium. When cover~
age of the Grinnell highvschool
homecoming takes precedence over
a campus social awareness evenL
there’s definitely a problem. Is a
homecoming more newsworthythan
a symposium dealing with pertinent
current issues?

It is not only the Asian-American
symposium which seems to have
been neglectedby the S & B,but also
other campus-wide events such as

the French revolution lecture series,
or the discussions on China’s upris-
ings.

I do not want to say thatour news-
paper prints junk—— goodness forbid
that one would suggest that the old-
est college newspaper west of the
Mississippi riverprintsanicles which
are not newsworthy. I just wish that
when an event occurs which even
the prestigious Des Moines Register
notices and prints, our own tena-
cious Scarlet and Black would have
the first scoop.

Our Right to Bear Arms Is as Real as Ever

 

To the Editor:

In “Our New Bill of Rights, and
Wrongs," (opinion, Sept 29), Bill
Lohaus exhibits a decided misun-
derstanding of the Second Amend-
ment to the Constitution,

The rightof the people to keep and
bear arms was seen as necessary for
the security of a free state: the Sec-
ond Amendment says as much. Mr.
Lohaus claims thatthis isareference
to invasion from without, whichit is.

However, it is also a reference to the
security of a free state against a
tyrranical federal power. Upon crea—
tion of a standing army under con-
trol of the federal government, the
right of the people to bear arms be
comes even more vital than before,
rather than “no longer necessary."
And by deﬁnition established by
the government, the militia is com-
posed of two parts: the organized
militia and the unorganized militia.

The unorganized militia is every
ablcrbodied citizen who is not a
member of the organized militia,

In conclusion, in his “self-right-
eousncss and willful narrowness of
vision,” Mr. Lohaus has misreprea
sentetl a major political and historir
cal issue. In light of such misinforv
mation, one cannot help wondering
aboutthevalidityofanyoftheinfon
mation presented in his columns,

LONGH-ORN

Without Our Oppressors

 

To the Editor:

You‘re right. As the authors ofthc
“Ms. Goodwrench” letter (Sept. 19),
we’d like to say that we’re sorry.

How dare we printsomething that
made almost the entire campus feel
uncomfonable, How dare we, like
all oppressed peoples, imagine for
even a moment a world without our
oppressor.

After all, we didn’t even intellec-
tualize our feelings or present them
in a non<humorous context.

From now on we‘ll try to do a
better job of taking care of your
feelings and making sure you never
have to confront internalized sex-
ism, homophobia or heterosexism.
Whenitcomes right down toitthat’s
not what our liberal education is for.

Starting today. we’ll shut our
windows and doors for our potlucks
and keep our menstruation celebra-
tions to ourselves. You can forget
about those threats of free tampons
and pads or more female physicists
and chemists, Let’s bring on the
feminine deodorant spray!

Those who want us to provide
further testament to their political
correctness can cutout this letter and
pin it to their chests to act as an
ofﬁcial “I'm not sexist, homophobic
or heterosexist" medal.

Thank you for your support.

How Glamorous Can Life in
a Refugee Camp Really Be?

 

To the Editor:

Once again, Palestine is in the
news. This should come as a pleas-
ant surprise for historians among us,
as for more than 40 years, Palestine
has been denied the right to exist.

According to Alexander Shchar-
ansky and David Feldman’s article
last week (”The Real Conflict," Sept.
29), on “May 15, 1948, Israel de-
clared independence. but the Arabs
did not." Now exactly which Arabs
are they referring to? The authors
somehow fail to realize that Palesr
tinian Arabs havean identity oftheir
own, independent of the other Arab
states in the region. Each Arab state
in the Middle-East has its own best
interests at heart, a phenomenon
common to politics cvcrywhcrc.

The authors conveniently point
out that “rather than being allowed
to assimilate and start a new life in
Jordan" in 1948, the Palestinians
were “cooped up in Arab camps“
and “kicked around the Middle East

and massacred at will.“ It would be
all too convenient for Israel if the
Palatinians resettled in Jordan —

but then “identity is not negotiable”
and Jordan isn't Palestine, even if the

authors can't differentiate between
Palestinians and Jordanians,

The authors funhermore commend
the treatment of Palestinians in the
Israeli-controlled refugee camps.
Agreed, conditions in the Israeli
camps may be better than conditions
in the camps of the neighboring
countries, but how glamorous can
life in a tent be?

The authors continuously make a
distinction between the PLO. and
the Palestinian people. By failing to
recognize thatthc P.L.O.irthevoice
of the Palestinian people and that the
suffering and oppression of the Pa]—
estinians undetlsraclirule are asreal
as Israel‘s security concerns, we
really do fail “to address the real
issues behind the conflict.”
