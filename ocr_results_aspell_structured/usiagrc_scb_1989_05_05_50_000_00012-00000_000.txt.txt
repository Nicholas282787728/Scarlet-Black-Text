Album review

The Waterboys' Blues

by Thomas Beverly

It’s bad enough that one pop-
ular Irish band, U2, decided to go
back, as a writer in London‘s
Time Out magazine put it, and
rediscover the music that every»
one thought had influenced them
in the first place. At about the
same time, however, yet another
slightly less popular band was
doing exactly the same thing. 1
speak, of course, of the Water
boys, the group that the fearless
Mike Scott has led through nu-
merous albums with widely varA
ied success and quality. The
name of their backrtorourrroots
travesty is Fisherman‘s Blues, a
collection 'of Iris'nrfolksy cuts
that is supposed to represent the
music that has driven the Water-
boys to whatever heights they
may have reached.

Ftr/terman'x 31m begins
with the title cut, which is really
a pretty good song, but as‘the al-
bum wears on it seems as if

Scott penned one decent tune and
decided he had the basis for an
entire album. What Fisherman's
Blues has to recommend it is re-
hashed ad infinitum for the rcr
mainder of the album, l0 lengthy
tracks in all.

It is not only the sheer vol-
ume of repetition that makes this
album so tedious, but also the
utter tunclessness of the voice of
Mike Scott. the band’s singer,
principle songwriter, and overall
leader. Scott chokes out about
three different pitches at various
points on Firnzrman's Blues, but
unfortunately by now it sounds
as if Scott has recognized his
own vocal limitations and begun
to pen monotonous songs to suit
ltis voice. It is hard to believe
that none of the nine other people
on the cover of this album could
sing any better.

by Louis Salctan

On Sunday, May 7, at 2
run. Roberts Thcatrc Will be the
scene ofa wild-boar hunt. a duel,
and an exchange of angry throats

tal disguised as a king. Once

semble, directed by Robert Vct-
ter, assrstant professor of mustc,
and the Javanese Dancers, dirt‘clcd
by Valerie Vetter, will present an
afternoon of Javanese music and
dance. The performance will fear
lure an adapted version of a drar
matic dance based on an littl-
century Javanese poem.

The portion of the story lhal
will be enacted tells of the tests
through which the gods put the
warrior Arjuna during his strug-
glc to gain the power he will
need to save the world from evil.
The gods first test Arjuna's con-
centration by tempting him with
the nymph Supraba. Having
passed this test, Arjuna oven re-

sists thc luring words of the god
Endra. who tries to convince Ar»
juna to withdraw from defending
humankind.

Eventually, the gods arc cone
vinced of Arjuna's determination
and recruit him to help them bat-
tle a kingdom of ogres. Arjuna
shoots with a bow at a Wild boar,
whlch is in rcalily the ogre Ma-
mangmurka transformed. The
god Balhara Guru simultaneously
has shot at the same wild boar.
Kilatawama and Arjuna then dis-
pute whose arrow killed the boar,
and their argument quickly grows
violent. One of them is killed,
but the other escorts the nymph
Supraba to the ogres’ kingdom to
find the vulnerable spot of the
0ng killg leatakawaca.

To find out who dies and who
“flies" (a Javanese dance move-
ment), go to the concert this
Sunday.
