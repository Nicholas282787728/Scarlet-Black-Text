OUR TRACK team has been for
tunate enough to secure the sere
vices ot Mr. J. P. Watson as train»
er again this year and he has
already taken charge ot the men.
Watson trained our track teams
in the last two years and lead
them to victory when defeat
seemed certain and would have
been a reality but for his skill.
He takes such a deep and per-
sonal interest in the team that lie
spares no efforts for its success.
He understands training and is
an expert in all its branches ot
track athletics and thus can aid
the men by practical illustration.
But above all he understli'nds bet-
ter howto put them in good pllysl'
cal condition than any man we
know and in the past he has had
the best conditioned teams on the
grounds at state meets. However,
the trainer alone is not capable of
winning the meets {or us it he
does not have plenty of material
to work with. Only tour at last
year's point winners at the state
meet will take part in athletics
this spring, and unless new nicn
in abundance can be induced to
come out and train, our chances of
success are indeed small. With
so few old athletes back the
chances of the new men are bright
and they should not fail to gettitii
regularly tor work.

The Dual Meet.

Negotiations have been again
opened between the managers ol’
‘the track teams of S. U, 1, ant]
Grinnell, in regard to the holding
of the Dual Meet, and .r is proba-
ble that a satisfactory solution of
difﬁculties will he arrived at. The
meet will be held in Iowa City
but the date has not yet been de
terrnined. Suggestions have also

been made by our managelilentl
in regard to the formation of a
permanent league tor the goveiile
ment of all athletics between the
two schools, and S, U. I, has rce
ceived them with favor It is to
be hoped that negotiations \\’l|l he
pushed in regard to this leirgiic
and that a satisfactory coriipnct
between the two schools may re
stilt. ‘
