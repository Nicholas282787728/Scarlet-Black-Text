Dlrect Legislation.

Eltwced Pomeroy. President of
the Direct Legislation League or
the United States. gave an address
in the college chupel on the sub-
ject of Direct Legislation. Saint--
day evening at 8 o'clock. the
men‘s socieltyQi/ork being post
poned one week tnr this reason
Mr. Pomeroy isa pleasant speaks
er and a man or charming person
21in and those wllouheard his tile
structive address will remember
the event with deep satisfaction.
Mr,,Pomeroy was the guest of
Pres. Gates and spokenpon his
invitation.

Thetcllowing nray'give perhaps
the main drift of the speaker's re-
marks:

Society.likethe brainlesspigeon,
cannotcoo'rdinate its movements.
Although this is the age ofthe
greatest material developments
of all time. still the existence of
theslumswiththeirravagesshows
thatsociety has failed to coordi.
nate its movements. And this is
true even here ill America where
we pay the greatest possible at-
tention to politics. Although we
claim to be the most democratic
orpeoples, still voiceless aspira-
tion and unexpresscd interests are
lowerdown here than in anyoriier
society

The statement of a great prinr
ciple is not enough, we must tree-
ly apply it. Hence in a democ-
racy the people cannot delegate
their power. Representative
democracy is to-day a confessed
failure in city state and national
politics, as is shown by the exist-
ence of great secret societies
which aim to take the place of
government to a large degree, by
the disgust ot' the people, by the
falling off of the vote and by a
strongly marked tendency to-
wards centralization and the des—
tructionoflocalgovernnient. In-
deed we are at the parting or the

 

ways. we mtist either fall back in
to ceiltraliy tion, the logical re
sult of representative government
with all its concentrated corrupe
rion a pyramid standing on its
apex. or move on to pure (lenloce
racy,a prurnid standing upon its
base.

We must rcharige.
pass trom
government.

\Ve lnlist
government to selfe
But how? Weli.
very simply, by direct legislation,
the Initiative and Referendum,
which is only the application to
larger aggregatcsoi the New Eng-
land totvn»mesting or the Russian
Mir. The Initiative is apetilion
signed by a certain per Cent. oi
the voters which would compel
the legislature to draft and subs
rnirtotlie people a certain law.
The Referendum is the submit
ting to the people of the laus
passed by the legislature it called
for after a certain length of
time by a certain per cent. oi the
voters. Legislatures would still
be needed but they would become
couiicilors ofthc people and not
law enactors. We mustsomcliow
retain the power in the hands of
the people all the time, as they do
in Brookline, Ma a large city
near Boston where they have die
rect legislation, They have all
the my problems that Boston has
except one—bad government.

The results of the introduction
of direct legislation would be
something as follows: the good
citizen would return to politics
The pressure upon our bad crti»
zcns which rs becoming dangerous
would be removed; he would have
a chance to express hirnselt and
half his grievcnces would disape
pear. There would be a vast and
beneﬁcral increase in the political
education of the people; meas-
ures and not men would be the
issues, There would be a strong
tendency toward simplicity in the
wording or the laws and toward
decrease in their number. And
there would be steady progress.
not progress by jCIks as at pre-
sent.

But by far the strongest argu-
merit is the socialistic one. This
is the era of cooperation; all pro-
gress is in that direction as is
shown by the trusts, the labor
unions, etc. At present we are
living under a sort of bastard so-

 

cialism, tinder lltc method but not
the spirit of true socialism. under
a socialisrii.loi the few; and the
only way to avel'lthc culmination
of all this in the \vorsttyranny the
world ever saw is to place all
power in the hands of the gimp/c.

Mr, Ponreioy also addressed
the bo’clnck rnecring oi the Chris-
tian AssociationsSunday evening;
on The Value or High Ideals in
the li less and Political World.

State Y. W. C. A. Convention.

The state conveniion of the Y.
W. C. A. held at Indir'inola from
November 3rd to 6th. was one of
the most inspiring and proﬁtable
in the history of this association.
There were about run vi, ting
delegates there, nearly every coir
Iege and city association in the
state being represented, besides a
number of well known woikers
front outside the state, who helped
conduct the convention.

on Thursday evening the 51ml)»
son Association held a reception
for their visitors which was very
largely attended and gave a good
start to the convention by making
all feel well acquainted.

One of the rnosl helpful and
enjoyable features of the session
was the “Two Hours with the
Bible," conducted by Mi Laura
Wild. the International secretary
oi the Bible department. One
could not help being influenced
by the wondcrrul personality and
consecration of Mr Wild, which
tirade these meetings
so much to all present.

Miss Reuse of London, Erie
gland, the lntcrnniional Y, W. C,
A. secretary, gave several short

on the work which sire is
carrying oil—that of organizing
Christian associations in foreign
lands where there is no religious
work in the schools Every one
attending the convention went
wholly ill love with Miss
and interested in her

great work.

Saturday
Sunday morning Major Blanche
Cox, of the Salvation Atrny. ad
dressed a crowded [reuse and told

evening and again

of her mission work in India and
elsewhere. She also conducted
the meeting lei women Sunday
afternoon. at which a large num-
ber took a new stand for Christ.

 

The conrercnces on the worlr in
cities and colleges conducted by

,ll/Irss Rouse and Miss Secvers of

Des Moincs, were interesting and
gnvea number or valuable sug-
gestions for carrying on Y. w. c.
A. work.

Mrs. Norvell was not able to
be present and Miss Wilkinson of
Indianola. who is a returned mis-
oionary from China, took her
place on the program, speaking
very strongly of her working in
China and the great need of more
workers there.

Miss Gregg of Chicago, told of
her Work as dcaconess in the slums
of that city and of the Chicago
Training School.

There were too many good
things to be told of in so short a
space. but among them might be
mentioned the address of Rev.
l-linnit of Ottrrmwa,Sundny even-
ing; the talks on “The Christian
Woman of the Community” by
Miss Seevers, and “The Christian
Woman in the College" by Miss
May Craig of Drake University.

On Sunday evening the leaders
of the convention spoke in the
various churches of the city. Miss
Mary Stever, secretary of the
Cedar Rapids Association, gave
an excellent talk at the M. E.
church.

Throughout the convention a
great deal of enthusiasm was
which indeed could not
iail to beinspired by the presence
or such acornpany or workers and

speakers. The missionary spirit
also was very strong. Everything
worked together to make this
Fifteenth Annual Convention one
whose inﬂuence will never die
out of the lives of those who
were present.

Of the hospitality of Indians
01a people and of the Simpson
association. too much praise can
not be said. From the moment
the visitors left the train they
were made to feel at home, not
only by the cordial greetings ex-
tended to them frorn the platform
but by the kindly hospitality ac-
corded to them in the homes of
the city. The Indianoln people
scented to make a special effort
that every visitor thereshould cnr
joy lierselt. and in this they sure
ly succeeded. No one delegate
left without a very warm spot in
her heart for Simpson College
and Inrlianola people and a wish
to repay them for their hos-
pilality.
