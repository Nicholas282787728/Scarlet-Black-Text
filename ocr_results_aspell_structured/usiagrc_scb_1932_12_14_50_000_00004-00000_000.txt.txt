"Pop’ Warner
Resigns Job

Veteran Stanford Mentor
to Coach Temple

i

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Calif,‘
(CNS)7Stanford was still in a daze
‘ihis week over the loss of a tradition
7for that is what it had come to re-
gard Coach Glenn S. “Pop" warn-
er, whose sudden resignation has left
students, faculty and alumni gasping
'for breath.

“Pop” had been at Stanford for
nine years during which time he
firmly established a reputation as a,
leading football genius. As the father
of the famous “Warner System," he
became known from one end of the"
~cnuntry to the other.

Meanwhile, the namcs of "Warner"
and “Stanford" became almost synon-
ymous, with the result must his de-
cislun to accept a coaching position
at Temple university in Philadelphia
.caused a frenzy of excitement.

While leaving an established instir
~tution to go to a young school "Pop"
maintains that his move was decided
upon primarily "to better my posi-
tion." Criticisms by alumni in the
southern part of the state during the
present season, however, are known
*to have irked him and probably
specded his decision.

Reporus that members of the
freshman football squad at Stanford
would follow Warner to Temple were
quickly denied, members of the team
pointing out that Temple university
'has a one-year eligibility rule, which
would tend to discourage such trans
'fem.
