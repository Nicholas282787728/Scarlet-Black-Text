The entrance of the building is

walls and ceilings are ﬁnished in Int
ural wood, There is direct entrance
trom the hall into the gymnasium
proper and into the two Directors’
ofﬁces to be used by those who have
charge of the gymnasium. There is
also communication trolrl the Ilall by
stairs to the running track alld visit-
ors' gallery, and also through a vesti-
bule to the first floor bath room.
There are two bath rooms, one on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor arid one on the second ﬂoor,
communicating by double swinging
doors with each other by separate
stairs, and with the main room and
the runninv track, as also with the
administration oﬁices.

The bath equipment is exceptiorr
ally trill. There are twenty-ﬁve
shower baths, each with two dressiirg
rooms, each dressing room having
four lockersitllat is, fifty dressiirg
rooms and two hundred lockers. The
building has room for additional baths
and lockers when they shall be re

lockers arid bath partitions are sup

lree troni the ﬂoor. The ﬂoor is of
cement alld can be ﬂooded entirely
“"fllOllllll‘lllgll‘tg the water into contact
. y wood work. The cement
ﬂoor 15 collstlucted in such a manner
that no leaking of the watei upon it
from the showeis, nor even the natur-
al absorption of the water by the cem-
ent, will dampen the ceiling below or
the wood work of the building. There
are two tttb baths and ample closets
and wash basins. The water for the
baths Is to be heated in the winter by
steam coils in a circulating boiler ill
the basement and' in the summer by
a battery of gasoline water heaters

There is a basement seven feet
high, dry arld well- -Iight_ed, under the
whole building. This gives 100111 for
bowling alleys and other college uses,
as need may arise.

ing brit provides its equipment with
apparatus, the best that cart be Irad,
furnished by the Narragansett Ma-
chine Company, of Providence, Rhode
Island.

The building has been put up iii
the Illost substantial manner. Al-
though it is as simple as the propriety
of its place would admit, being brrilt

urally It is entirely appropriate both
to its position on the Campus and to
the use which it serves. Indeed the
building as a whole is one of the best
in the country. There is, so far as I
know, nothing equal to it west of the
Alleghanymountains. Theapparatrls
is designed especially for women. In-
deed the building is erected exclusively
for women’s work. Neither the
building nor the apparatrrs will be
rrsed by the men of the institution
It is the regret of all that they are trot
equally well provided. May it be
that they will not need to wait long.

Miss Rand may be assrrred thatsrrch
a gift tronr her is appreciated by t1 m.
tees, faculty and strrdents. The set I
vice which it will r'endel to the wom-
en of Iowa College can not be meas-
ured. It will aid the college irl its de-
sire to send out some generations of
riot only educated women but women
better equipped physically tor the work
that lies before them in lite.

Exercises appropriate to the dedi-
cation ot the building will be held 011
Tuesday evening, November}0th, at
eight o’clock, The evening will be
devoted to a reception at the gymna~
sium by Miss Rand and the college
women to the trustees, taculty, stuv
dents and friends of the college. N0
FORMAL INVITATIONS WILL BE SENT
OUT BEYOND THIS STATEMENT WHICH
CARRIES WITH IT AN INVITATION TO
ALL TIIE FRIENDS OF THE COLLEGE
FOR THAT EVENING. During the

evening there will be tlle following ...

There are songs with a melody wondronsly
sweet
And words that are clear and strong,
Eat the heart 0! the singer is careless alrd
cold
And we miss the charm or the song.

But our hearts have a thought beside which
but naught
The words of our song become:

Hurrah ror the gymnasiunrl
