,‘lPI’LAUSIl 1N CHAPEL.

The coming ot Sherwood Eddy again h ngs up the
question ot whether or not the audience should applaud
in chapel. It has always been a Gi'iunell tradition, and
we think it a good one—for reasons we will give litter,
that there should he no applause during or after the
morning service.

When Sherwood Eddy was introduced Thu’rsllay
morning, a slight clatter; or applause went lipifor no
reason whatever except that Mr. Eddy, a man of great
and worthy reputation, u s introduced. Twice during
his speech, when he referred favorably to the League
or Nations and later to Thompson and Chicago in an no
complimentary manner, some overly—enthusiastic listen-
ers spattetl their hands in intellectual glue. and still fur-
ther ignored the long standing tradition of the chapel.

To uphold a tradition merely for the sake of a tril-
ditiun is scarcely commendable, but this one of ”no ap-
plause" is a worthy custom. The chapel service in the
morning has something of a sacred nature, Whether one
believes in it or not. It would hardly be logical to ap—
plaud ‘a speaker in such a service, then settle down to
a prayer, and still not applaud for the prayer. Nor
would it be any more reasonable to clap one’s hands in
appreciation of the flourish with which the organist
'concludcs tho scrvice. The whole procedure would be

inconsistent, and furthermore it would he n breakdolrn‘

of‘ the custom on which the present tradition bases its
consistency.

REBEL BUILDINGS.

The objections to the prone cu blliltlillgqillit plan of
government have been answered publicly one by one
ill order to give the men il thorough understanding of
[he tine oi goVDl‘lllllcnt lllllt is being contemplated and to
make them realize that nothing is going to be forced
(lawn their throats in one big lump. Without their know-
ledge.

There has been some question about ulll‘lll'y or re
bellious halls under the new form. What. if one building
does not care to enforce its laws zls strictly as the oth-
ers? There may be a certain element ﬂinch; the men
that will tend to move into that building, and hence es-
tablish an unrlll)‘ hall. How would the new plan of
government handle that?

Such a situation was a problem, but it has been
solled, on paper at lenst. In the [list place, there is
nothing to stop the men from moving into a certain
building if they please now. Any hall may become un-
ruly until an outside authority steps, in. In the new plan,
the Council of House Chairmen would act in it super-
visor capa’city over the house morale ol‘ all the bililtle
ings. \Vhen any hall began to fail to enforce rules, to
be rebellious, this body could call the attention of
the house chairman 0i that hall a ttiug ill the group.
If no action were taken to remedy the situation by the
hall itself, the Council of House Chairmen could (him
refer the matter to the College council, which would have
power to take away the social privileges or punish the
entire hail as it saw fit.'providing there were sufficient
\Vith such a Check the tendency toward It rer
belliolls group collecting in a separate hail would on
