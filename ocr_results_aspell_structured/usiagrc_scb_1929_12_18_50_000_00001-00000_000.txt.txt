Score of 22-15

Wins First Game of Season;
Shows Possibilities

for Fine Year.

Murray Is New Star

Dimilmtive Soph Plays Brilliantly,
as Douglas Stars at Guard;

DeLong Scores High\

A pivoting, dribbling \Vllleo-the—
wisp, Harold Murray, and a sturdy,
blond guard. Ben Douglas, stood side
by side to block the rumbling Golden
Avalanche which invaded Grinnell
last Saturday night. The Giinnell
cagers won their opening game of
the season from Marquette, 22 to 15.

The battle was ﬁlled with stars.
The little sophomore ran circles
around the tall Marquette players
while Douglas was a big factor in
halting the Marquette offensive. Bob
DeLong, Coach Truesdale's hot shot
forward candidate, lived up to pre-
season reports by coming through
with six points to lead his team.
Andrew was the only Marquette bet
in the starring list, The lanky cent-
er scored eight points '20 lead the
shooters. He made his four ﬁeld
goals in the ﬁrst half and was effec-
tively stopped in the second period.

Grinnell Takes Lead

MacElligott opened the scoring
with a gift toss for Marquette. hut
Murray matched him with a pair for
Grinnell, The lead was in foreign
hands throughout most of the ﬁrst
half and Marquette was leading at
the intermission, ii to 10. Early in
the second half the Grinneilians
started to work, however, and with
ﬁve minutes to play led, 20 to 15.
Coach Lipe of Marquette sent King
into the game with instructions to
"be tough” and for the ﬁnal moments
the contest was almost «a brawl.
There was no stopping the drive of
the Pioneers, however. and Douglas-
long basket ended the scoring for the
day.

Conch Truesdale pulled a surprise
line-up at the start by using Wilhelm
at center and Corrough at forward.
He soon put Bob DeLong into the
game, however. although he kept the
captain at the pivot post throughout
most of the contest

Coach to Keep
Squad at Work

Workouts Are General This
Week; Team to Play

Minnesota Jan. 4.

Although fairly well satisfied with
the work of his men in the opening
cage contest of the season against
Marquette Saturday night, Coach
Truesdale is by no means certain
that the outﬁt which carried the
brunt of the work in that contest will
he the group assigned regular berths.

Throughout this week the mentor
is giving his men rather general
work with an eye toward improving
the entire squad. He will call the
men back from Christmas recess on
Dec. 27 to start drilling directly for
the game with the University of
Minnesota at Minneapolis. Jan, 4.

Resume Practice Early

Hi2 quintet will return to Grinnell
the following day and on the even-
ing of Jan. 5. the day before the
opening of school following the holi-
days, will tackle the St. Louis uni-
versity quintet here. Coach Trucs»
dale ranks the aggregation from
down the river as one of the toughest
outﬁts Grinnell will have to face this
season and will expect a big crowd
of students back in time to see the
game before they start their study
ing again. n

Plans aie under way to make it a
night of big entertainment with a
dance following the game.

Detroit, scheduled for Nov, 1, has

Says Nollen.

ls Innovation Here

Standard GoursjngVﬂl Be offered,
But ‘Arts of Expression' Will
Be Stressed Especially.

Giinnell college will have a sum-
mer session of six weeks in 1930, be—
ginning on June 16 and ending July
27, according to present plans made
known today by Dean John S. Noi
len Although the idea is an experi-
mental one for Grinnell, summer
school not having been held here for
many years, nevertheless it is plan.
nod to offer many worthwhile
courses in standard subjects, as fol.
lows:

Especial stress will be laid upon
the "arts of expression,” namely,
speech, dramatics and pageantry,
writing. music, physical training
and athletics. In all of these very zt—
tractive courses will be offered,
“More will be done with this range
of subjects than in most summer
schools,” Dean Noilcn stated yester-
day.

Faculty Sponsers idea

Courses will be offered also in edn.
cation, psychology. English, mathe.
matics, laboratory sciences, history
and political science and possibly in
other subjects it there is sufficient
demand for them.

The Grinnell faculty, under whose
auspices the summer session will be
held, feels that Grinnell offers up-
usual facilities for an agreeable
period of summer work. Outstanding
ing among these facilities are men-
.tioned Grinnell’s residence quad-
rangles, and ample opportunities for
‘exercise, including the swimming
pool, tennis courts, golf links. Stress
is also laid upon the attractiveness
and beauty of the campus itself at
this season. Ml of these factors. it
is believed, will attract students here
for a summer session,

Plans Not Complete.

According to Dean Nollen, the
clientele which the college has in
mind for summer school students in-
cludes present Crinnell students. stu-
dents from other institutions, high
school teachers wishing additional
work in their own f his or seeking“
work in education or psychology:
high school graduates who wish to
prepare themselves for the transition
to college next fall and any other
students interested in college work.

While plans for the summer ses-
sion are not yet completed, the p;es~
ent announcement of courses to be
offered, together with the fact that
,a strong teaching staff is being lined
lup, are expected to make Grinnell's
‘1930 slimmer session sufficiently
lsuccessful to warrant its adoption as
a permanent part of the Grinnell
school yeai.
