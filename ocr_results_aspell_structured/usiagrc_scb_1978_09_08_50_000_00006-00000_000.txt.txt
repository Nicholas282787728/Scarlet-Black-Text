cording to Acting Librarian Steve

for another 30,000 volumes as welli
as extending the life expectancy of
the library by approximately eight
years,

/\T THE PRESENT time, not
weeding out of books is planned to
alleviate the space problem. Due to
the Size oi the library staff, present
weeding is very limited. One
solution, according to Pandolfo, is
the poSSlbility 'that in the tuture,
books checked out would be
reclassified under the new system,

remaining Dewey classified books

present collection from about
230,000 to 450.000 volumes in ap-
proximately 20 years,

The major Burling structural
changes are on the drawmg board.
Presently, the ”mam idea,” ac.
cording to Pandolio, "is to get
more shelf space for growth."

()TIIER WORK DONE during
llics nnicr includes a new roof on
Norris Hall Also during the
summer, new “indows were in
stalled in most oi the remaining
north campus dorms Repaiis are
still being made to the roof of the
line arts building,

Many routine improvements
such its exterior painting,
replacement of Sidewalks along
Park Street. reupholslering grill
iuriiiture, and laying sod on
Rosenbloom Field were also
completed.

FUTURE PLANS FOR the
physical renovation of the college
are included in the capital ims
provements campaign. One of the
less publicized improvements,
mandated by iederal law, will be
the renovation of Main Hall to
accommodate the handicapped To
accomplish this task, the elevator
will be replaced, ramps will
provide access to the building. and
bathroom facilities and room doors
will be enlarged

Browning stated that “I'd like to
see us also develop some facilities
on the north campus " As of now, a
person in a wheelchair cannot en.
ter many of the buildings on
campus.

TWO OTHER PROJECTS being
contemplated are the renovation of
Goodnow Hall and changes in
Norris Hall. As always, the major
problem is collecting funds, which,
commented Browning, is “a major
concern of higher education in
general." He emphasized,
"financially, we do have some
pretty tough years ahead."

stars. “Ugh." you say. “tacky. A
bourgeois display of wealth,
Another Airport ‘76." Yes. but look
at It this way, it there are 12 Slars
and the film is two hours long. we
should get approximately ten
minutes with each star. Ten
minutes of Michael York, Richard
Widmark, Anthony Perkins, Sean
Connery, Martin Balsam, and
Jacqueline Bisset may be more
than enough, but ten minutes with
Vanessa Redgrave. Lauren Bacall,
and John Gielgud could be en-
joyable. And later minutes with
lngrid Bergman and Albert Finney
may be the closest thing to God
rve iound yet.

The film is based on one of
Agatha Christie's pleasantly es»
capist mysteries. A murder is
committed at night in the sleeping
compartment next to Hercule
Poirot (how come I’ve never met
anyone named Hercule in 2i
years?i and he sets out to uncover
the murderer by interrogating the
other passengers on the train,
