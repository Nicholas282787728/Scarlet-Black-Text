Women's self-governing or.
ranizations originated in war
men's colleges. The University

educational'schuol to have a
sell—governing organization tor
women. The iirst conierencc ot

legiate association for women‘s
sell—government met at the
University oi Wisconsin in
May, 1913. This association was
the basis oi the Intercollegiate.
Association ot Women Stu~

governing organisations

scd topics such as point system,
honor systems, senior advisors,
cleaning up politics. vocational
conferences, means of raising
money, and the power and au-
thority oi the AWS.

the third conference in Novem-
ber, 1914 Here it was decided
to have the national conferences
two years apart. At the iiith
conierence in 1918, the AWS
took up the topic of war work.
Suggestions made as to the kind
of war work ,collegc women
could do included knitting dur-
ing class lectures. Membership in
the Middle Western association
for Women’s Selerovemment
increased during the war years.
The sixth conference in 1919
developed women’s war reiiet
committees. This time the knit—
ting was done for reiugce chilr
drcn.

Means to control extreme
forms ot dancing and crowd-
ed post—war housing conditions
at college were discussed at
the seventh conierencc in 1920.
Membership then included 30
schools.

A visiting California delegate
attended the ninth conference
and it was decided to form' a
national organization. The first,
national meeting was in l923. i

“International Responsibilities”,
was the topic tor discussion at
the sectional contci-ence in 1930.
“The Place of the AWS in the
Postwar World” was discussed}
at the national coniercncc in
1947.

Workshop topics tor 1956
included the question oi a
limit on extra—curricular activ—
ities and the problems increas—
ed enrollment present to the
activity program. A special
committee of a sectional con-
ference in 1956 discussed ci—
icctive communications sys-
tems among member schools
.and more benetits irom memr
bership tor local organism
tions.

By Bowen. Dawson

President Howard R.
Bowen and John C. Dauson
(economics and business)
are to be iliembers of a (li‘
Cussioll panel appear lg
Tuesday before tlle Congres-
sional Subcommittee on Fiscal
policy. Bowen and Dawson are
scheduled to dlSCHSS their joint
paper, “Education and Econom-
ic Growth," as part of the sub-
tomlnitlee's consideration of
"federal expenditures tor devel-
opment oi human resources in-
cluding health, education, and
social security.”

Daﬂ'son and Bowen are
among those whom the sub-
Committce asked to prepare
report! on the relation or red—
eral spending programs to the
nation‘s economic growth and
stability. The subcommittee is
under the Joint Economic com-
mittee of Congress.

In their report, Bowen and
Dawson emphasized the import-
ance of education in creating a
productive labor force. which
they consider ultimately the
most important of a nation's
productive resources. They ex-
pressed a fear that this country's
system of higher education
“will deteriorate through inade-
quate support in face of num~
bars."

“We are Opposed to central-
ized control over our colleges

and universities, and for that
reason we are reluctant to sug—
gest greater iederal aid to high—
er education. But the dangers to
our economy and our country are
intinitcly greater it higher edu—
cation stagnates through neglect
than if the tcderal government
contributes iiuancially through
mechanisms involving arm's-
lcngth relationships with
colleges and universities,"

The two prnnosed that fed-

mended that there he a mini-
