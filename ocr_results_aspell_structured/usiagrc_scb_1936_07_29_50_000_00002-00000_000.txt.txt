Norwood Speaks ,
at Conference
on Relations

At the second annual session or
the Grinnell institute of Interna—
tional Relations, Mr. Frederick w.
Norwood, minister of London’s
city Temple, made a number of
speeches upon the difference in
the way peoples think. The fol-
lowing is an excerpt from one of
his speeches:

Advance of science and of me-
chanics have brought the nations
of the world together, while in
thinking and in attitudes they are

centuries apart. How can the
emperor and the President be
brought to see alike?

The people of Japan have been
trained in implicit obedience, in
'reverence for a military caste and
disdain for the merchant caste.
In China the values are reversed
and the scholar is at the top.
Ethiopia still has slavery, and
tortures meted out as court sen-
tences. How can we unite such
diverse groups? >

Mediaovnl groups, according to
Leuissohn. had mutual understand—
ing, but in this modern world no
common ground is left. Even
classes in any single nation are
wide apart, The intellectual,
consequence, is apt to retreat into
the past, of to build himself an
ideal nonexistent world. This i=
especially true of religious lead
are. For a religious leader who.
wants to be true to traditions of
the past and also alive to the de-
velopments of the "surging pres~
ent" this is embarrassing.

:Mr. Nor-wood went around the
world to observe at first hand
what is happening to the world,
The Bible was the only book hel
carried with him. He thought it;;
might be useful to read it among
peoples of the East whose ways
cit thinking are similar to the

"The Easterners have a. spirit-
uality we have almost lost be-

“They draw something
out of the infinite which we have
forgotten how to observe."

Mr. Norwood was born in Aus~
tralia and has traveled through
most of the world, speaking in
South Africa, 1ndla, China, Japan.
Canada, and New York. He has
taken graduate work at both on
erlin college and Ursinus college,
and was chaplain to Australian
troops in France.

beauty prize winner. The follow—
ing were selected as judges: one
iceman, one plumber and one

Grinnell “Tanager”
Revised in Fall

Thc "Tanager," Grinnell literary
magazine, will be entirely revised
this tall, Carl A. Niemeyer, editor
of the publication, announced bee
fore school closed last spring.

“We feel that there is not
enough student interest," Mr. Nie-
meyer continued. A direct effort
will he made to obtain more stu-
dent—writtten material, such as
stories, articles, essays, and hook
reviews. The students may sub—
mit their material directly to the
"Tanager” hoard next fall.

A salaried business manager, a
student who has yet to be select—
ed, will have charge of circula—
tion and subscriptions. A definite
drive will be made to secure read-
ers among the alumni and present
students.
