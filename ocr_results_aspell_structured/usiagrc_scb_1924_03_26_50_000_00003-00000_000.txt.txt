EDITOR SCARLET AND BLACK.

Hamlet (Who would have Sunday dates, but is lelused)
“To have them or no , that is the question:

Whether 'tis nobler m the mind to sulier—

The slings and arrows ol outraged nonrsensicalness
Dr to take arms against a viiiu show or student gov't,
And by opposing it, have our Sunday dates.‘

To tor-hear: to sleep; (All day Sunday); and by a sleep
To say we satisiy our longings and the high purposes .
or our institution, 'tis a consummation

Devoutly to he wished. To f0YheBJ', to slee ;
Pol-chance to dream, ay, there's the rub;

For in that sleep to kill time, what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled or: this mortal coil.

Must give us pause. There's the thot at the dates

\Ve might be havin ; fOI‘ who would hear the whips
And scams or the Women's League Board.

The pangs or a despised tradition breaker

(Which tradition is a vagary and a farce)

J§ut that the dread of something after the date,
I-Iaviog one's girl campused, puzzles the will,

And makes us rather hear those ills we have

Than my to others that We know not of?

(Trust the League Board, ably assisted, to invent others!)
Thus hypocritical clinging to Lin-natural law

Does make cowards or us all, and thus the native hue ,
or resolution is si lied o'er with the pale cast of that,
And "dates" oi great pitch and moment

With this regard their currents turn awry

, And lose the name of action.

Come to the

Wouldn't it give your newly engaged plmls-to-be-married-

or congratulation after the usual sticky sentiments?
J. P. McEvoy whose play "The Potters” has just opened on
Broadway is the man responsible and the artist who drew
the tiny thumbnail sketches to illustrate each phrase has
made of the card a smashing success as Z}. friendly joke.

last year was president of the Lantern and the Y. M. c. A., senior judge,
