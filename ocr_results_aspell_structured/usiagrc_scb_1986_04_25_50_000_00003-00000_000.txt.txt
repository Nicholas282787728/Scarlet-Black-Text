O’Prey letter
endorsed

To the Editor:

I would like to respond to the letter and
its carauthors David Altman and Kevin
O'Prey which appeared in last week‘s
issue of the Scarlet 81. Black under the caps
tion, “A Prudent Response."

First of all. this letter presented a
coherent and iorcetul argument in justify-
ing the United States' recent bombing oi
Libya. Am I right in understanding that
the imperative of the day is to punish
Libya. by whatever means. for being an inn
ternational outlaw" There are just a cou-
ple things i would like to know

Why did our leaders iail to punish Syria
and Iran while they were about the job oi
punishing Libya? As state sponsored tern
i-oi-ism goes, Libya is not the biggest
perpetrator It just barks the loudest.
Syria and lran each have .far more exten-
Slve terrorist operations and neither has
been any more amicable to diplomatic ine
itiatnes nor any more deterred by
economic pressure than has Libya

Why didn‘t the bulk oi" our allies in
Western Europe support us? Western
Europe has sul iered more casualties at the
hands of the aforementioned terrorists
than has the United States. yet still did not
Iind our behavior a "respected norm of
retaliation." Or have they failed to unders
land the language and reasoning of inter-
national affairs?

The letter is clearly correct in two
respects. Libya has been an aggressive
state. Our bombing could have been more
extensive It was not, however, reasonable
or prudent. A prudent response would have
addressed the issues motivating ter-
rorism, whatever its national origin
Reagan's initiative does nothing of the
sort. At best it was a futile attempt to treat
symptoms. futile because it has already
lead to retaliation. At worst it was a shot
Iired in anger. a classic case of passion
hindering reason.

Actors of all rationalities have
historically challenged whatever balance
oi power prevailed in their time. and gun
powder and bombs have been the most
tried method of deterring said challengers.
We would do well to recognize that such
methods of deterrence do not have a suc
cess rate anywhere near as high as their
popularity, and petition our leaders to pur»
sue more cool headed policies before they
lose what little control of the situation they
have left, — Frank Rawland, '87

Letters

Messages of hate

To the Editor:

i feel I have to write concerning recent
antigay acts performed on campus, and
actions which folIowed these, of which, I
am sure. most of the students are
unaware

GCGC has been very prominent on cam-
pus lately, as last week members met with
Jim Tederman concerning the proposal to
create a Gay Resource Center, In
response. l assume, to the meetings and
support rallies. a number oi antirgay in-
cidents occurred on campus

Wednesday evening as l ieit dinner. I
saw newspaper and sprayspaint signs
posted all over Cowles, taped on the tree
outside the dining hall, wrapped around
the sculpture on central campus, and
plastered on the Walls of Bul'ling and the
bookstore

I was Sickened at the sentiment I saw.
displayed in a style very much like van-
dalisni. Sproyrpaililcd in red and black. in
paint so heavy that some signs were only
readable from the back, were statements
rcading ’I'm Sick of a lesbian 7 I".O.R "
rind "Fuck you 7 F O R " As I read the
signs. someone else reacted by aping up
new signs over them. replyin 'm sick
of hatred" and "Who are you‘ Initially I
thought that was enough. Thinking back on
it Iater. I felt so offended I went back and
removed all the signs I had seen.

I found out later that ROE. was a band
trom New Mexico which played in North
Lounge on Saturday night. The F.O,R
signs put up the preceding Wednesday
were the spontaneous action oi a person or
group on campus. they were not requested
or condoned by the band. which had its
own publicity, Knowing that alter the tact.
I again ielt yustiiied in removing the signs.
The sentiments expressed were so violent
and hating. lacking any value as adver-
tisements or constructive opinion, I
removed them as I would scrub a wall of
hate-filled graffiti.

That Friday. someone pointed out to me
a sign outside of the bookstore. It read, “In
an act of senseless FEAR and IG-
NORANCE. GCGC destroyed several
signs supporting no.5. GCGC is
forgiven.”

I couldn't believe the assumptions that
the creators oi these signs were making. In
the first place. although the authors were
able to identify a group which might have
been offended by the signs, when the signs
disappeared the reaction was to ieel that
the group was misguided. rather than that
the signs were intrinsically oliensive and
therefore justifiably removed.

In the second place. the notice blaming
GCGC for removal oi the signs states that
the Fort, signs were “destroyed" out oi
“senseless tear and ignorance " Yet they
tiad no evidence that the signs were
destroyed 7 there was no defacement and
no retaliation. In tact they were simply
removed. Additionally. they were not
removed out or “fear and ignorance." but
out oi hatred and disgust [or such violent
and senseless expression,

in the third place. a tear oi that sort oi
opinion is not senseless. even on Grinnell's
pristine campus Last Wednesday night. a
visitor at Grinnell was irightened late in
the evening Crossing the street outside
Younker. she heard a male \‘OICC scream
at her, "Lesbian!" scaring hci- enough to
make her seek the satcty oi one oi the
dorms As the woman is the tiancee or a
oi-iiiiieli student. she is obviously not a less
hian. Even it she were it would make no
diitcrence. The mural oi this story is that It
is not ”senseless" or "igiioralll ‘ for gays
or non~gays to tear when they see violent,
anti-gay messages. there is still hatred eXr
pressed in this society and on this campus,

It was senior John Tyson's fiancee who
was verbally assaulted Thursday night. i
would like to relate a poem written by John
after these several events occurred on
campus. A copy oi the poem has been
posted in each of the dining halls since last
Thursday

I have seen anonymous messages oi hate.
spray painted in red.

I have heard insults. hurled from the
darkness oi night,

Are you against homosexuality"

Do you approve oi or participate in these
terror tactics?

what do you tear. that you hide behind
anonymity?

Or is it that you are as ashamed of your
own actions. as i am ot you?

i am sickened by such close-minded ate
titudes, They don‘t belong on this cam~
pus or anywhere else!

When I see the hatred and hear the insultsi
I am ashamed oi Humanity

John‘s message illustrates that violent.
antirgay messages are not irightening and
offensive only to gays. Even if they were.
an oilense against that group is still an oi’s
lense. Hatred of gays is not justified Simp-
ly because they are in the minority. And
blaming gays ior other people's dislike oi
violence is not iair to gays Nor does it give
enough credit to the authors tor being truly
oilcnsivc Don't blame me gays in this
world. whom you seem to "hate" and
“fear ’ Blame yourselves. anonymous
authors — those Signs were offensive to all
people. Then “blame" me . I was offends
ed by the newspaper and sprayspaint
advertisements for FD R " and I took
them down And i have the courage and
conviction to state my feelings publicly
And give my name Those messages were
IlalcrIIIled and valldalistlu. and I will do
my best to remove them whenever 1 see
them, In the future, IhC creators oI such
signs can blame the proper agent of their
icinoval -- a concerned human being. 7
