ON THE WEATHER

One begins to wonder, ill this era of droutll
and dust storms, just what perverse deity con
trols the rain taps, and what he has against the
middle west in general and Grinnell ill particular.

Wi h a schedule of three big track meets on
the spring athletic program, the college athletic
department has been striving valiantly to get the
local track ill the best possible condition for the
armies of athletes assembling weekly at Grillnell in
the hope of erasing numerous and sundry track and
field records from the books.

Jupiter Plnvius has consistently ignored the
pleas for rain that have been rising from these
parts, except for an infrequent sprinkle accom-
panied b a dust storm, which he has dribblcd down
llpoll a disgusted world lvith the aggravating taunt.
“Here’s lllud ill your eye.”

Cracker-box conversation has been greatly re
stricted ill variety of weather topics available. The.
query, “Do you think it’ll rain?H is looked upon
as downright silly. The talk of the day consists prie
nlar’ , of discussing the probable source of the lat-
est blanket of dust.

With conscientious aid from the weather bur
reall, the Grinnell athletic department, aided and
abetted by some 10 or 15 million farmers, might be
able to do something about it, bllt so for this sup-
port lias been lacking. If instead of tilnidly hinting
at "showers and cooler,” the predictors of the
weather would boldly augur “dust storllls with
probable rise ill temperature,” the dry area would
no doubt be inundated immediately.

The effectiveness of such psychology is re»
vealed bysthe rain today, which was very obviously
induced by the artificial soaking which the track
was given early this morning pllls the prediction of
new records on the consequently fast oval. Tllc
weather is only dependable in its perversity,

ABNORMAL MINDS

In studying abnormal psychology, one is sur-
prised to find how widespread mental diseases are.
The queer behavior of one ’5 friends is often Illumir
nated. And oftell, when impartial, one discovers,
much to is clnbarrassment, an explanation for tho
peclllinri s of his own behavio . Most people are
abnormal mentally ill one way or another It is
the degree in lvhich olle is psychopathic, wh ll sepe
arates the average ci lzcn from the individual cone
fined ill an institution.

Generalizing about the causes of abnormal
minds has great limitations. However, psycholoe
gists are agreed that mental diseases, for the most
part, are caused by a maladjustment between the
illdi idual and his environment.

For instance, there is that fearsome term,
“schizophrenia,” or split personality, a condition
in which the subject’s lnind is divorced from real-
ity, which results ill unreasonable and grotesque
behavior. There is “paranoia,” in which the indive
iduul unjustly believes that bc is personnted, or
that he is of great importance. And there is “mane
icedcpressivc psychoses,” in which the patient, for
no apparent reason, goes from the heights of joy-
ous cestacy to the depths of abysmal melancholy.

These, and a host of other abnormalities, in-
cluding homosc 'uality, are believed to be due to
a lack of integration of the, illdivdual’s emotional
life with his social surroundings

Foremost thinkers and psychologists, like
John Dewey, Havclock Ellis, and Bertrand Rus—
sell, ﬂcillllll) believe that the environment is [)I‘Ir
lllarily responsible for such difficulties Thcl' ad-
vocate social rcorganizaton, ill which cl ton ind
traditons would promote the full cxpl on of
emotional life, rather than thwarting it. The 0
practical ideals because they are based upon '
tii'ic knowledge.

People, these men contend, are millet
and cruelly frustrated ill their normal cxpr
The result is an attempt to escape from life, to
compensate for olle’s frustrations. Inhibitions, com»
plexcs and profound introversion are too often
the result.

Dewey, E11 and Russecll are looked upon
with horror and anger by the old-fashioned, lrnt .
tional thinkers. Yet these men challenge us to look
facts in the face, and to reorganize social institu-
tions in the light of modern scientific invgsitigaation.

Other Opinions

FALSE ALARM
(Daily Ransan)

The public has been viewing with some trepidation
the drafting of theorizing college professors into the ser-
vices of the New Deal. The brains trust, an anomaly
by the way, has been popularly regarded as an unknown
quantity in safe government,

Even the explosion of the silly Dr. Wirt sear-e has
not entirely erased the idea that perhaps there is some—
thing to be feared In the New Dears advisers.

Jonathan Mitchell, through Harper's Magazine, gives
another view of the professors capacities. He says the
NRA, to AbAA, and the Securities Act are essentially RP
bitrations in the old conflicts between debtors and crcd-
itors, big business and small business, employers and la»
borcrs. And the success of the arbitration depends up-
on the neutrality of the arbitrators.

Some Wall street men might be able to give bet-
ter advice on money matters than Professor Warren,
but a wall of distrust on the part of the public following
such an appointment would have blocked any negotia-
tions, however just and sincere. Even Lindbergh was
by some regarded with suspicion as being influenced by
his business connections in objecting to the air mail pol-
icy of the government. The country needed immediate
action, and President Roosevelt could not risk splitting
his support by showing partisanship.

Furthermore, the professors can have little voice in
passing laws. Politics simply doesn't move in that way.
Laws are formulated from the pressure of many forces,
factions and organizations which are out of the profes-
sors’ reach. The scholars are necessary to the Presr
dent's program, but the novelty of their position should
not lead to an over-estimation of their powers and for
sultant dangers. '

How ABOUT ANOTHER LAW?
(The Drexel Observer)

With Dillinger loose in the Middle West and an ar-
my large enough to start a Mexican Revolution pursuing
him, America assumes a ludicrous position in the world.
These are the times when sane men tear their hair and
the more wild-eyed cry out for “bigger and better laws.”
And why more laws? We have enough now if we would
only enforce them.

There is one law which covers this and every other
similar case, and that is the law of common sense. Why
any man should be allowed to own a machinevgun is he-
yond power of understanding. The Constitution rightly
proclaims for everyone the privlege to keep and bear
arms. The right to own a machine-gun certainly should
not be included in this category. The ownership of small
arms, rifles and revolvers, is easily justified. They may
be used for hunting, target shooting, and many other
forms of amusement. They are also useful as a weapon
for protectionof life and property. Certainly no such
arguments may be found for ownership of machine-guns.
No one ever hunted deer, rabbits, or other game with a
machine-gun, and their use in target practice is rather
open to question. And anyone who needs a machine~gun
for protective purposes should be exposed to congression-
al investigation.

No law could be passed which would eliminate Dil-
lingers. They will crop up from to time, and with mod-
ern methods of transportation in a country as opemand
scatteredlas ours, they will always be hard to catch.
When a man can travel three or four hundred miles in
a day, as he can now, and when he can find as much
open country to hide in as there exists in the United
States, it is difficult to corner him. And when he is
armed with a machine-gun and is willing to shoot, as
Dillinger has shown that he is, it is more dangerous to
try to capture him. But when he is captured the chase
should be over for good.

Why not make the possession of a machinergun, in
itself, an offence punishable with a heavy jail sentence 7
Lawyers of questionable character can always be found
to defend even the most hardened criminal, and by their
quibbling and fighting they can often for-stay sentence.
But no lawyer can argue away a machine-gun which is
found in a man's possession. Why not use this, his own
weapon, to hang him?

G
A SOMBER COLLEGE REUNION
(Columbia Spetcator)

Two or three years ago these hundreds of men and
women were enrolled in colleges. Many of them were
studying on this campus. They were young, enthusias
tic, engrossed in the immediate tasks and diversions of
undergraduate life.

Today they are reunited on the campus, grimly
clinging to CWS jobs around the university. These jobs
threaten momentarily to slip through their fingers. They
are making their last valiant stand before they beg for
places on the relief rolls or shuffle hopelessly toward the
corner. ,

They were normal college students, They were con-
fident that white-collar men would get more classes,
heard some stimulating. thoughtful words, nestled com»
fortably in the shade of John Jay hall, played "college
boy” in their off-time-and waited,

A few months after graduation their perspective
was deeply altered. They had discovered the real mean-
ing of a jobless world. They were, disturbing as it
seemed, unwanted.

The cws projects were inaugurated at a time when
the confidence, the deep-seated assurance of the people.
had reached the breaking point. These projects, glowing
and blithe promises, temporarily stemmed the crisis in
which they had found themselves.

Then. with shartling suddeness, CWS’ was declared
at an end, The breathingespcll was over. Dismissals
were to begin at once aiming at a gradual abandonment
of the entire program.

From that day on no job has been secure. These
ex»studeuts have been in hourly fear of summary release.
They have realized their status is no more permanent
than that of any manual laborer, that they are subject
to forces over which they exercise no control.

These students who once disdained labor organiza-
tions, who considered themselves above rank-and-file
alignment, now face the alternatives of fighting with
their colleagues for these posts or stumbling unaided
through the street, They are facing the realities which
as students they had thought of in detached, academic
terms.

College students today are prone to dismiss their
fears of just such eventualities. They still nurture the
illusions which these employees have seen shattered.

The Columbia seniors who voted blithely for gin,
bridge, Democratic politics, and college football may see
their future shadows in the nervous young men working
desperately to halt the doom of CW5.
