A landlord can be the bane Ufa tenant's ex»
tstence, or the person who foods them a [mum‘-
mg and lends out cookie sheets, Students who
are pkmnirlg to live off campus are urged to
check with current tenants and the Office 0/
Student Af/airs for information an landwnis
lie/ore signing a lease. Although there are a few
big landlords who oversee sevemt properties,
most Grinnell hindlords own just one building.
The [allowing ts the brief rundown on a law of
Gnnnelt ‘x more prominent landlords.

The places are warm, clean, furnished
and reasonable ~ and the landlord goes
south every winter. These are just a few of
the many complimentary comments given
O.H. Black by his student tenants.

Most of the tenants interviewed reported
that upon moving into their new homes
they encountered clean, furnished rooms
In fact, when Martha Finder moved into
her two bedroom apartment on 5th Ave,
she met Mrs. Black, who was just replac-
ing the newly washed mattress pad. "1 just
couldn't believe she was really over here,
puttering around," Pinder remarked.

Other surprises for the tenants included
the lack of the required security deposit
and the leniency while Black and his
winter caretaker show when rent is late.
Anson Rohr, who lives in a two-bedroom
apartment on Broad Street, said he usually
leaves his check Laped on the outside of his
door. When he has trouble gettin the
money at the beginning of the month, die
Blacks or the maintenance person come by
again a few days later.

ferent Black Apartmean on 4th} Avenue,

 

The lowdown on landlords:
Who’ 3 a hassle, who’ 3 a help

usually sends in her rent. “But it you call
and say the rent is going to be late, he
won’t come around," she said, Black does
drop by occasionally, she added, yet,
“He's so old that he can't really move that
well, so either his wife comes to the door or
he sits out in the driveway and hunks or
whistles,"

When fixtures in the apartment need
repair, maintenance people who work for
Black are prompt in getting the job done.
Dickinson said, “When ynu call, someone
comes usually the same day or the tirst
thing the next morning, and they‘ll do
whatever you want: you just have to be pa
tient and lriendly.

The reviews of the repair jobs are not as
favorable, however. Rohr said, “I'm not
impressed with the handiwork.” Finder
also recommended that “Black should find
someone else.”

While most students find the rent “very
reasonable especially for the quality ot the
apartment you get." As Dickinson says,
the big plus is paying only tor electricity
and not heat and water. “And was in-
credibly warm," Plnder said, “We even
had to shut the vents." Other advantages
include having Hie walks shoveled and
grass cut by the maintenance people.
(Although Dickinson recalled instances
when the lawnmower was raving away at a
a.m.)

Rohr altered the only complaint about
the ieatures oi an apartment. The plumb-
ing in his secondstory unit is erratic, be
reported, and if the firstrfloor residents
are using any water, the hot or cold quits
running or the water pressure drops.

When apartment hunting in Grinneil
some students claim it' is best to steer clear
of Effie Kunce. Though Student Affairs is
usually realiable about tips on who to
avoid, there is nothing like first hand ex-
perience In any case Eilies reputation
isn t completely notorious, two of her cur
rent tenants were more man willing to
share their comments about her reputas
tion.

To begin with her son is a lawyer. This
enables her to “use the law to harass peo-
ple,” according to one tenant He claimed
that she doen t ordinarily return deposits
unless the tenant threateningly demands
it. Usually tenants are outoritown, and the
ordeal of getting the money back is often
too much trouble. There have been some
instances, however, when Effie has been
take tu small claims court for this reason,

This same tenant complained that atone
time, early, in the semester, his roomate
had contacted Effie in order to get an ex-
terminator m rid their apartment of mice

page 4 Scarlet and Blue March 18, 1983

and cockroach Infestation, She claimed
that she didn't receive enough money from
their rent to justily this expense. Besides
this “minor" inconvenience, things in the
apartment break and remain broken
because she just doen’t get around to fix-
ing them.”

Why not leave the apartment?' This par-
ticular tenant basically likes the apart-
ment setup, and feels he can learn to live

’ with mice and cockroaches. Besides this,

he has a dog, and Effie is one oi the only
landladies who permits dogs in her apartr
ments. In addition, her rent is com»
paratively low. ,

Another tenant wasn’t so quick to justin
staying and said, “If I had realized what I
was getting myself into, 1 wouldn’t have
rented from her." There are no locks on
any or the doors, and as a result, no keys
have been given to them since the beginnr

A problem shared by two of the tenants
interviewed was that ol controlling bugs.
Both oi their apartments have roaches
The second tenant’s apartment also has
had beetles, ants and a snake which came
in through a hole in a bedroom wall.
Eyestone did not provide an exterminator,
but he did supply insecticide. Sinai‘s apart-
ment had mice, and she said Eyestone
“wasn’t too cool about the mice.” She
bought mousetraps for them herself.

Eyestone requires that renters sign a
lease for the entire year. They must find
subletters themselves if thev leave fur the
summer. Rent is paid monthly at the
Poweshie'k'bank, and Eyestone asks for a
$100 damage deposit, which is usually
returned with no problems,

Some landlords own only one building,
and as a result, their relations with their
tenants tend to be a lot more personal.

Since November when the cold weather
rolled in this apartment has bad no heat

mg of the year. There are no lights install-
ed in any or the landings. For the lights
that are there, no bulbs are ever replaced
This must be done at the tenanm expense.
Since November, when the cold weather
finally rolled in, there has been no heat.
“Thank goodness it has been a com»
paratively mild winter." The apartment is
very rundown “It should be condemned."

Wilbur G, Eyestone gets mixed reviews
as a landlord. While he is quite pleasant,
and some of his buildings contain lovely
apartments, they did not seem to be in a
uniform state of repair. Allison Paich Said
her two-story apartment is “amazingly
well- -kept, " but another Eyestone
leaseholder complained of general
disrepair. Laura Sinai said ”The house
itsell is rundown. , _ ,

One renter said the plumbing in her
apartment is very good but the “wallpaper
is rotting off the kitchen walls." When she
washed the kitchen floor, parts of the
linoleum broke into pieces. Sinai’s apart-
ment had been vacant for a year before
she moved in, and it was “pretty gross,"
she said.

All three tenants said Eyestone answers
calls lor repairs promptly. Paich had trou~
ble with her stove, and Eyestone allowed
her to have it fixed and billed to him im-
mediately. “He's really been an ac
comodating landlord,” Paich said. The
other tenant, however, said that although
Eyestone responds quickly, “Things
sometimes have to be fixed twice because
they weren‘t fixed right the first time.”

These landlords sometimes provide [ur-
niture, lend kitchen utensils, shovel snow
and cut the lawn themselves.

Norman Hall, who owns 1015 High
Street, has rented to college students for
years. “We like his style,” tenant John
Norman explained “He treats us like
adults." The building is clean and in good
shape according to Norman, and the
landlord is prompt and reliable about
repairs. He has had few problems in his
apartment this year, and Hall attended to
them all. In addition, Hall cuts the lawn,
shovels snow and helps his tenants ac-
quire inexpensive, used furniture when
neededal-lall includes utilities in the rent,
even though the downstairs apartment has
an air conditioner, He and his tenants
seem to have a good relationship. “He
never complains, Norman commented
“He's easy going."

Conveniently located kitty»corner lrom
the Pub, 1032 East Street is one of the nicer
student apartments in town. In fact,
several current tenants like the house and
their landlord Raymond Ahrens so much
that they are going to stay anodier year.
According to Daniel Klatz, one at the five
tenants of the largest apartment in the
building, Ahrens is an “excellent
landlord." The rent is reasonable and
Ahrens includes all utilities, Klatz says “if
anything goes wrong,“ his landlord “is
[here within the day." So far they have had
no problems, and Ahrens has never com-
plained.
