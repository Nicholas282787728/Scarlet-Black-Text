Thanks to the incompleteness of
the opposing teams, the Grinnell
wrestling team was able to tuck
away a few victories for the ’75776
season. Last week the Pioneer
grapplers \vere away battling
Simpson and Central at Central
College. Simpson did not prove to
be much of a challenge when they
forfeited four of the nine weight
classes. On top of the forfeits
Grinnell Won two matches with
ease The first victory was a first
period pin by Dan Mosby (167) and
the other was a lopsided decision

final score between the two teams
was 33-21.

That same day the matmen
suffered their fourth loss of the
season when Central College

B—ballers grab two

by Toni Arenbcrg

The Grinnell varsity basketball
team gained two close victories at
home last weekend and suddenly
has a chance to join the race for
second spot in the Midwest Cons
ference.

The Pioneers edged out the
Beldit Buccaneers, 71770, last
Friday night and got by the Lake
Forest Flaming Reds, 75-72, the
next afternoon. In a key weekend
series, the team plays the Ripon
nedmen today at 4 pin. and
the Lawrence Vikings tomorrow at
3:00 pm. If Grinnell sweeps both
games, as it did last weekend, the
Pioneers \vill have a chance to end
the season as high as second place.
A double loss might ruin all hopes
for a good finish.

Last week, Grinnell was tied for
last place and apparently out of the
battle for second spotr (Coe has
probably clinched the chamv
pionship.) But the Pioneers’ record
is now 4-5, good enough for sixth
place out of nine teams and
perhaps within striking distance of
secondplace Cornell (773).

Ripon, 5-5, which beat Grinnell
earlier this season. 9873. might be
better than its record indicatesr
Last week, it came within two
pains of upsetting undefeated Coe.
Lawrence is somewhat weak
defensively and is tied for last
place with a 273 record. One of
those wins was over the Pioneers,
78-75.

the Pioneers gave the Bucs a free

ran out.

The lead in the game frequently
changed hands and the largest
spread was a seven-point Grinnell
advantage very early in the second
half. The Pioneers top performer
was forward Jeff Fallon, who
scored 12 points and grabbed 13
rebounds.
