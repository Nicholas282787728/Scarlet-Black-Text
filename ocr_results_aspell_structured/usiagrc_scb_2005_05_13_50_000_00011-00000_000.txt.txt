A rant dedicated to spring

sure, it’s been raining most of the week, but 1
don't want to ram. Instead,1 want to suggest that we
all smile more because it's springtime. Spring! stop
stressing out met your schoolwork-it's not so import
tant in the grent scheme oFlife.

Try getting some sleep, going [or a jog, lmthing
yourself, painting your toenails, frolicking outdoors,
hitting u ) ppy Hour at the Depot, watching n lit-
tle Ainei . Idol (America was even smart enough
to vote on Anthony this weeki), lounging on the
loggia, and finishing up the night with some Bruce
Springsteen on the jukebox at the Pub, some other
good things to Consider this springtime: baby bun-
nies, Stewart Library, Dari Barn, 1014 FM, people-
watching in the Forum, scooping the loop (in either
titteet-tonl), skirts and ﬂip-ﬂops, women's magazines,
milking out, dmce parties, and your fabulous friends.

Happy spring!

Have some concert etiquette Wake up

I’m not one to rain on iinyonc’s parade, but 1 am Dear fellow Gtiiinellinns,
extremely frustrated with the lack of concert criquelte
displayed by Gr'umell saidents. ltyonie not at a sum
41 show, quit jumping, If it's not Slipknot, then quit
ﬂicking pushing people. Ifwe somehow gor an amazing
hand like Built to Spill to play Grinnell, Lhcn just dance.
Hate some respect {or others around you and for the
band because you’re militiug the shows and embarrass
ing as all.

wake up.This is your life. Live it. Thank you.
