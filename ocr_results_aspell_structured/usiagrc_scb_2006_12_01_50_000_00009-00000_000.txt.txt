Trademark Grinnell

How exactly do you sell Grinnell?
Recently the administration released
a position paper entitled “Strength-
ening the public proﬁle or Grinnell
College," a prdiminary document
formulated by srculty members, ad»
nrinistrators, and trustees. It advor
, cares creating a stronger public im-
age by roeusing on four things that
makes Grinnell stand out from other
' liberal arts schools: “elfectivc and
ethical leaders
_, ship”; “creative
studies and ins
terdiseiplinary
A arts”; “inter-‘
national stud-
, ies and global
connections"- ,
» and inquiry
based science learning" But th's
_ description of the Grinnell brand rs
incomplete.
We agree that in trying to
' strengthen our national proﬁle, we
should highlight these opportunities
and academic strengths. When we
ﬁrst read the position paper, though,
- we felt uneasy. There is a pervasive
feeling, deep down, that' in creating
a strong public image we might be
come “just like everyone else.”But on
reﬂection, it wasn't the fact that there
was a position paper that made us
nervous. Instead, we felt that some-
thing was missing,

If Grinnell advertises based only
on these strengths, the college would
be overlook»

ing what makes

Grinnell
unique: our com-
pus culture. This
should be includ-
cd in the position
paper for a Simi‘r

instead of handing out demerits for
underage drinking. Though there will
always be things to improve upon,
Grinnell is spccial because it empha-
sizes both individual and community,
the formation of conscientious citir
lens and a tightknit and supportive
community. Many schools encour-
age ethical leadership, but Grinnell
is unique in its long history of sociill
activism and our track record ofqllcv
tioning the status quo,

We agree that Grinncll should
have a permanent spot on the higher
education mlap becausc we think our-
little college in the middle of the
cornﬁelds has a lot to offer poten-
tial students, In increasing our public

profile, the college
should try to at—
tract more quirky,
passionate people
who think that
Grinnell‘s com-
munity sounds
pretty cool.

To do that, we
need to share both our academics and
our community with a national audiv
once, but without portraying Grinnell
as a onevsize-frts-all school. While
Grinnell should certainly be known
for the four components included
in the position paper, our college is
unique because of things that are
harder to put into bullet points. Our
public profile should convey the idior
syncratic ethos that makes Grinnell
what it is. We urge the college to re-
vise our public proﬁle to share this
with potential students.

Promises of purple politics

Why Washington’s pledges of bipartisanship will not last long

Good news {oi the disillusioned American who

squahhlurg, furger poinrrug, and blame-games that
have long charrcterrzcd Capitol IrIrll will he plat-oil
wrrh Washington’s tworirc,r led pr-or dip/un-
rvrrrrlrrp. Americans have rarely seen “purple polrtits,”
n for ' and mysterious
creation that occurs when
the “Reds" and the “Blues"
agree to stop ycllrng at
each other, Brit in 2007,
Wrrshmgton is changing
colors.

Three weeks ago, on
nearly every television station, clectiorlrlliglir vrcwcrs
watched as dumbfounded and disheartened chllbr
lican strarcgrsts, polurcirrns, anti vorcrs contemplated
their place In a new polltlcrll environment controlled
by the Dcrnoerntrc Flirty. ironically, the very men who,
over the lust two years, had argued that rhc 2004 Rte
publicmr mandate pcrrrnrrcd them to disregrrded the
sugvcsnorls of libera"ls, were the vcrysrrme individur
nls eagerly expressing their dcsrrc to “seek new, bipal~
tisun solutions" and to “work closely with the Demo-
cratic majority" in order to solve the problems facing
”oul"rlation in 2007.

somewhere, a Democratic congressman must be
laughrng, For six years the Republican Congress urre
compromisingly perused its pl‘oﬂtln‘ilnlslmtion, cone
sermtive goals without corrsultrng Democratic law-
makers, tr process that reduced Scnatc Democrats to
near nothingness and forced them to rely solely upon
the filibuster rn order to counter partisan polrrics. And
now, rhc new Republican minority thinks they can
play ball with the men and women on the other side
ofthc aisle?

indeed, a number of marquee Republicans have
declared thcrr intent tojoin congressional Democrats
in makrng the 2007 legislative cycle productive and
rewarding. Scnutc Minority Lcadcreclcct Mitch Me
Councll (R710!) and President Bush, for example,
have both stressed their desire to work with Pelosr,
Reid and Coin hopes ofsolvrng every narronal prob
lem from the war in Iraq to Social sccuriry.

But will the calls for bipartisanship really lead to
amm/ compromise and reconciliation, or will Wash-
ington merely be engnrlfcd by a new wave of partisan
purulysis’ Probably rlrc lrillcr. True, the Democratic
majority in the House is theoretically largc enough to
pass lrbcralrlcaning legislation, but the more two-scat
Democratic advantage in the senate will likely force
lrbcral House Democrats to moderate rhcir proposals
so that House bills are more acceptable to the Sllll’
powerful Republrcnn scnrrre rnirror-rry

For their part, Republicans should have every inc
ccntivc in the world to compromise with the Dcl‘no’
cratrc Innjullry and remam a viable governing party.

But more likely, the GOP will plav the role of thc

from the center provides fcrrilc ground for political
grandstmrding, but often does little to encourage
compromise tlizlt hencfrrs rlrc American people,

indeed, the only politician for whom bipartisan»
ship seems to be a favorable oprron rs the George W.
Bush, although he may not rcilllze rt. Unlike Demo-
crntic and Republican congressmen, the President's
days are officially numbered and he has :r strong inter
est in building his legacy. The Prcsrdcnr has signaled
his desire to Cultivate a constructivc dialogue with
the new Democratic majority, Brit Bush’s immediate,
postrelccrion attempts to ram conservative ilppomlr
merits and policies through the Republican Congress
before its December expiration date, coupled with
his unwavering stance on the war in Iraq, seemingly
undermine his calls for an end to urrderhanded par-
tisanship.

In the end, 2007 will likely be an unproductive
cycle, brrmrniug with partisan fighting and political
gridlock as both parties look to avoid mistakes that
could cost them the White House in 2008. Demo
crats wrll rarsc the minimum wage and play around
with taxes, while neglecting to seriously tackle the
larger issues of the day, such as social Security and
immlgmtion that would severely increase rhc politrcal
stakes, us well as the risks oflosillg. Republicans, in
the meantime, will lambasre Democrats for not doe
mg enough, trying to make the case to the American
people that the GOP could rrrnwashmgton more cfr
fcctively and efncicnrly.

Sadly, nothing will change and partrsanship will
live to rum another day. America will become increas-
ingly rnor-c divrdcd and polarized.

I liked it better when I thought we would all be
holding hands. After all, isn't that What Washington
promised us.>

A long history of awkward

Eccentricity, com. from p.8

Don’t mock mi: ) Anyway, I'm going ro go ahead ilnd
blame it on all those obnoxious krds on the bus in clr
cnicnlullly school who would pctulantly ask wllclhcl l
hlld .r 'srrlllng problem" wllcncvcrlzunutl our, deep rn
thought. How much cmhuinssmcnt and ilwkwultlr

~ miglrr I have spared rf I had only lcnlllcd
at an early rrge to respond wrrh “your tact- lllls _ luring
problem?" The world may never know.

In in i u world, i would take a pure and unrne
hibitcd joy .u flouting socrctnl conventions i would
sing lorrdly wlrrlc walking between classes, pausing
only lo chat with adorable squirrels I wou ld glildr

loudlvcursmg the futility of tlrrs modern life 1 would
add orrtlnrrdishly fraudulent Frcehnok friend dctarls

the nerve to tell rhc people 1 want to make our wrrh

that I'm up for ncckrng Bur rcdisticallgl know that
these would never happen, mostly bcciusc of .r vague
but hiltlnli g feu- ofdir-ry looks, gossip, reiccnou and
null security guards,

so \vlirltewr run I to do with mv awkward self?

Will I spend my whole 1ch surrcptlilomly sneak
