Pioneers Cagers

To Face Beloit

Saturday Night

John Pfltsch’s Pioneers will
Climax their cagc campaign
when they meet Beloit, newly
crowned champion of the Mid-,
west conference at Beloit to—
morrow night,

The Grinnell squad will wit-
ness a full dress preview of
their match with the tar famed
“Bucket Brigade,” when they
watch the Golds take on Law-
rence this evening.

Grinnell. trying ior an upset,
laces one of the iinest small
college teams in the nation.
Going into tonight‘s contest
with the Vikings, Beloit is un-
defeated ,in eight conference
starts, and boasts an over-all
iseason’s record of 22 victories
-and 3 losses,

Dolph Stanley‘s boys dropped
games to Louisville, Duouesne,
and the team ranked ninth in
the country, Bowling Green. On
the other side of the ledger, the
Wisconsin club holds a 69754
win over ,St. Mary’s of Califore
nia. Tuesday Beloit whipped
River Falls Teachers 75767,

With second place in the cone
ference sewed up, Grinnell now
has a season’s total oi 12 wins
and 4 defeats.

Sparking the attack of the
host school will be their now
famous “Taylorville Twins,"
center Ronnie Bontemps and
John Orr, torward. Bontemps,
a on. 4-in, sophomore, is cur-
rently fourth in conference
scoring in his first 19 contests
he racked up 345 points for a
13.2 game average and came
out with a shooting percentage
of .412.

The flashy sophomore poured
in 34 points against Lawrence
a few weeks back, but his high
for the season is 52 at the ex-t
pense or Ottawa college oi: Kane
sas in December .

John Orr; li-ft. 3-in, teams up
with Fran Stahr, a classy tor-
ward, also from Taylorville
high, one of the better basket-
ball institutions in Illinois.

One bright spot in the pier
ture is the fact that the Pio»
neers won't have to put up with
John Erickson, the lad~who
caused severe apoplexy among
Gl'innell fans in Darby gym last
year with his one hand push
shots from the side. He didn't
believe in hackboards. The
bothersome Mr. Erickson com-
pleted his eligibility at the end
of last semester.
