To the Editor:

The members of the Library
Planning committee have al-
ready lost a whole series of
lbcls to the effect that Grin-
,ncll students, if provided a ﬁrst
class library, at once function-
all and beautiful, would use il
in the spirit in which it was
planned, All but 10 to 15 poi
cent do, but the rest havc been
behaving very badly. Hero is
some of the evidence behind
my statement:

1, Several pieces of ruini-
ture have already been dam—
aged, and thc ﬁnish of several
rooms has been moored, (Ms
hogany table in Grinnell mom
scratched badly by shoes,
burns in Aaltn table in 20th
Century room, Eames and
Thonet chair seats marred by
shocs, the ﬁnish of the listen-
ing booths badly scratched
and marred by shoes)

2, The library has been so
carelessly used that the janltor»
inl staff has to deal constantly
with nuisance. Furniture has
been moved about at random;
shoes have left dirt on chall-
bottoms, table tops, on the cork
baffles oi- carrcls and on walls.
Dealing with this nuisance has
taken up so much janitorial
time that the stall has not been
able to follow the regular
schedule of maintenance that
has been set up. Such nuisance
will vciy shortly be damaging,
as excessive cleaning and mov-
ing about is bad for furniture.

We have, 1 think, two
choices before us: (1) move
back to Cunegie, ARI-l, the
science building, nnd the
dorms, in- (2) learn to use
Burling as iicsponsiblo people,
that is, people who do not
demand for themselves any
rights or privileges which
they deny to others. Either
we should all light bonﬁres in
the jumbo stoneware ashtrays
by Heath, Gunmetal, 01' none
of us should.

I should like to suggest three
simple things that each of us
could do while using Burling,
which would solve all mainles
Home and damage problems.

1. Smoke with core, using
the ash receivers provided. (it
is not necessary to put out
cigarettes on a tile ﬂoor when
an ssh tray is at hand, yet
the ﬂoors of the seminar
rooms are continually littered
with butts.)

2. Don’t move the furniture,

Acid
and
Base

by John Stocking

The drinking of alcoholic
beverages, and the smoking
of cigarettes are both detri-
mental to the health of so-
ciety. Yet both are perma-
nent and unremovable parts
of our social life If Grinnell
college had a rule against
smoking, the students would
lock themselves in their
rooms, and smoke under
their beds, or in some ingen-
ious way manage to poison
their lungs despite the rule
—and they would do this
Without the social benefits
of a social cigarette with
the gang.

We do, it seems, have a rule
against drinking alcoholic he-
verages. I would like to re-
mind you—you have surely

thought of it yourselves—that
this rule has a detrimental
effect which far surpasses its
dubious bencfils as a supics-
sive inccsui-c.

Authorities agree that solitary
drinking is far more dangerous
than social drinking. Alcohol’s
“benefits" are either of a narco—
tic, or of a social nature. The
drinking rule at Grinnell cle-
strays the social aspect of
drinking and encourages slu—
dents—(m the way dry states
encourage bootlegging) to
sneak to their room to drown
their conflicts and sorrows in
solitary intemperence. Social
drinking at Grinnell, as known
in normal society, is non-exist-
ant.

Rule-makers seem to feel
that because the Devil is not
clearly visible on the’ surface,
ho is «loud in the underground
spheres, What a lougbl Tell
that one to Dostoevsky. The
devil is challenged by rules
land ccsuiclcns to go under
gmiind to do his work, car-
rupting under a. farcical hy-
pocrite’s satln covci of coded
morality; and it is equally
true oi lhc ncvil Rum.

Is a roudy drinking party,
wizh singing, dancing and revel-
iy worse than sneaky drinking
lin lonely rooms for purely
lnsccolic affects? Bring the Devil
lRum inlo the daylight.
