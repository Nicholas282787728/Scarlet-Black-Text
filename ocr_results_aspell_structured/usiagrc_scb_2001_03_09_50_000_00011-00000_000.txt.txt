When 1 came ro crinnell as a wideeyed ﬁrsteyear six 51:»

Being a ﬁrst-year, 1 rhoughr rhis seemed like
a very reasonable plan. 1 also rhoughr rhar ir

and that going ro class every morning was a new

That's why my plans have changed. 1 don’t wenr ro be a

Never heard ora sporrs pliysicisr, you say? Neither have 1,
bur iremsrcin can ﬁgure our relativity, 1 can ﬁgure our away to

one job only: in explain all ofsporrs with laws of physics. We
will use Newton and Einstein and Hawking to explain why
curve balls curve. how quarterbacks quarterback and why
slrrirrlceocks shrrrrle and cock.

I'm nor deluding myself, these tasks won't be easy, We sporrs
physicists will have to come up wirh new methods and experi»
merits ro explore ﬁilly our ﬁeld. Just as Newton came up wirh

Sports physics will also have its token unsolved mysteries

While orher physicists are snuggling to discover silly rhings
like how graviry works, my colleagues and 1 will be srruggling

Needless to say, l'in pretty enthused to srarr my career
