In the past, athletic dope writers
used to judge the prospects tor the

Michigan Daily Starts Plan to
Handle College Press Work
by Radio.

A plan to handle college newspapei
sci-rice through thcicollege wireless
stations of the vnrious colleges and
universities has been suggested by the
Michigan Daily, The Michigan paper
has already tried handling athletic
reports with big Ton conference
schools by means ol the college wire-
Iless equipment, and the Scarlet and
Blaclmhas been invited to become a
member of the new new: vcrvice.

The condition of the, college wii s

physics department heads think that
it is in rather poor shape, accol'dlllg’
to information renchins the s w B
oiirec today. berm-e the war the
uircless equipment was used mainly
for recalling correct tune and wcatlier
reports in the plly. cs department.
and it has not been installed again
since it-was dismantled in léspniisell
to a war order. it is doubtful, how- :

 

and aids in publicity work for the
college.

Physics department heads doubt
whether there are any operators in
college capable of handling this ser-
vice. They state however that there
may be some students who would be
willing to take air interest in the pro-
ject, and would reestablish the local
station.

The Scarlet and Black would be
glad to hear of anyone in school who
can use a key, or who can put the
local station into operation.

The colleg‘e gospel team has been
keeping several outlet town engage-
ments of late. A week ago Sunday it
spent a. busy day in Brooklyn. The
Chronicle reports that the services at
which the club appeared were intel'r
esting and instructive.
