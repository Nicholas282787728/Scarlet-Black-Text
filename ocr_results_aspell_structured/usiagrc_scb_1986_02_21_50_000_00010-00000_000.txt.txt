GRINNELL, IA ~ Diane E. (Dee) Fair~
child has been named director of inter-
collegiate athletics at Grinnell College, ef—
fective June 1, less. Exemplifying Grin-
nell‘s nickname, the Pioneers, Fairchild’s
appoinu'nent makes her the first woman
athletic director at Grinnell and the second
in the state of Iowa.

Pioneering has been a way of life for
Fairchild. As a senior at Mankato Staw
Unviersity (MN) in 1967, she was a
member of the first women’s intern
collegiate varsity basketball team. After
earning a bachelor's degree in health and
physicial education and a master's in
education, Fairchild began her teaching
career in Norwood, MN, where she was the
first to teach sex education to students in
grades 7-12.

Continuing her series of “firsts,” Fair-
child moved on to institute the first
organized physical education program at
St. Albans City Elementary School in Ver-
mont, where she served as director of
physical education for four years before
heading to Johnson State College in Ver—
mont. There she served as assistant proe
lessor. coordinator of women‘s athletics,
director of intramurals, and assistant
athletic director prior to her promotion to
athletic director. In her numerous
ca pacities at Johnson State, Fairchild was
instrumental in instituting and maintain-
ing a successful women's athletic program
and in working toward the implementation
or a physical education major.

Fairchild came to Grinnell College in
1934 as assistant professor oi physical
education and coordinator of women s
athletics She was named chairperson of
the physical education department in 1985.

Her recent appointment to athletic direc-
tor makes Fairchild only the 20th woman
in the history of 3113 NCAA Division III
schools and only the 315i of all 793 college
and universities in NCAA Divisions I, II,
and III to assume such a post.

”Women in athletics have come a long
way in a short time — it's only been about
20 years that women’s intercollegiate
athletic programs have existed,“ stated
Fairchild. “I think we still have a ways to
go in terms of bettering attitudes toward
women’s sports in general, I intend to treat
men's and women‘s sports equally.”

Athletics have always been an integral
part ot Fairchild‘s life, Raised in a family
of three brothers, athletic achievement
and outdoor sports were a major part of
her life. College highlighted a successful
athletic career, as she was the Minnesota
State Collegiate Doubles Badminton
Champion and runner»up state champion
in singles play her junior and senior year.
She was also a starting guard in basketball
and played fastepitch softball and semi-pro
volleyball.

Her success as an athlete carried over
into an accomplished coaching career. Her
coaching record in varSity college field
hockey is 84-24-11 and includes two
undefeated teams in 1977 and 1975 and a
1985 Grinnell team ranked fourth in the
Great Lakes Region NCAA Division III:

In her new position, Fairchild succeeds
John A. Pfitsch, the longest tenured
athletic director in Grinnell's 140 year
history and in the history of the Midwest
Collegiate Athletic Conference. He joined
Grinnell College as assistant professor of
physical education and basketball coach in
1940 and was named athletic director in
1952. He will leave behind an indelible
athletic imprint.

the 1,650 Free, and the 200 Fly. He also has

the freshman records in all the events
listed above, as well as freshman records
in the 200 and 400 Individual Medley eenml

I talked to Dave and asked him how he
felt about breaking the records. Said
Anderson: “I really am not thinking about

of my teammates. If I happen to break a
