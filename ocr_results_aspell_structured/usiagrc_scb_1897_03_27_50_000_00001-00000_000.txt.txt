Villa Whitney White.

The second number of the Sub
scription concert series last even»
ing. was one at the ﬁnest musical
treats ever enjoyed by a Grinnell
audience. Miss Villa Whitney
White gave her lcctirre rccital on
"German Folk-Song From the
Fifteenth Century to Our Time.”
asarrangcd by Dr. l-leirrrich Rei-
mann. of Berlin.

The program as a whole was
remarkably characterized by its
thorough unity, and giving as it
did to the audience a deﬁnite idea

Dione form of music. it was as an
educational factor, iar superior to
a miscellaneous program.

Miss White’s explanations
shou'cd admirably the evolution
and continuous growth oithc folk
song. l—ler remarks throughout
were remarkably free from tech-
nicai terms and ivet'e'interestilig
and appreciable to all her audi-
encc. The impossibility of secure
ing good metrical translations nee
cessitated the use of the German
rvords in nearly all the numbers,
but the translations with which
they were pretaced,in which Miss
White showed unusually happy
faculty in reading, rendered the
tollesongs enjoyable even to those
who do not understand German.

Miss White's voice is periectly
reﬁned, and she does not use it to
display its technical qualitres, but
rather to explcss the sentimental
the songs. In the softcr passages
and in crescendos and diminucn-
dos, she showed especially good
control of her voice.

Of the individual numbers. the
“Pommcrsches Volkslicd.” the
“Schwzibischcs Volkslied,” “Die
Lore,” "Der Hirsch," were given
ﬁnc rcndition. Tile “Spinrierliedr
chen," representing the lighter-
folksong, witir no trace oi the sad
tone which is 50 marked in many

 

of the earlier ones, was one oi the
best reccived or theevcnirrg. Tire

"Tanzlied" has among the darnti.
est numbers, and the closing num-
ber, tho "Wiegenired." was capti-
vating rn its softness and sympa-
thetic qualities The most artis-
tic number and probably the most
enjoyed. was "Sam, rvo siud die
Veilchcn hirrr“ The aocornpanr
merits by Miss Drlirngham were
faultless, and were perfectly exr
proesive or the melody oi the
Volklied. The program was as
follows:
