Comedian has Iowa on his mind

Gary Kroeger left Iowa to “make it big” in
New York and, unlike most wideseyed aspir—
ing actors, he actually did. l<roeger worked on
Saturday MgIJt Liar from 1982 to 1985 and
later hosted TIN Nl‘lU/ywl'll Gama. Since then,
his career has been a patchy series of appears
:Inccs on television shows, including Curb Your
Elllbilrl'nrm and LA. Law, andvoiceover work.
After marrying and having a son, Kroeger des
cided the best place to build a career was not
New York or Los Angelcs, but Cedar Falls,
Iowa. Kroeger spoke at Grinnell Monday
night, encouraging students to consider
living permanently in Iowa and to mm,
but the undeserved “hick image” of the
Hawkeye State.

W/mt didymi 1})in about [yam‘fi‘imdx
mufﬁn/lily] who stayed in Iowa sour/r you
were in LA ?

When I left Cedar Falls, I kind of
thought I was doing something special,
like I am getting out of the rut. I didn’t
look down on my friends, but I thought,
“Gee, why wouldn't they want to get out
or here [00?" Eur as the years went by,

I would come back for Christmas [and] the
Fourth of July and my life was somewhat of
a struggle in terms of my career—because en-
tertainment can be that way, I would look at
my friends who stayed in Cedar Falls, who had
good jobs and ice houses and were involved
in school activities with their kids, and I would
get very jealous. And I would think, “You gniys
did it right." I thought that there was this big
world out there, fame and fortune, glitter and
glamour, and it was so meaningful and impor-
tant. But I would look at my friends and go,
“You know what? You had it right. You are
living good solid Lives."And now when I hang
out with them, I get to be one of those guys.

It's like, “You know what? We took different
routes, but here we are." And we share our kids,
school issues, sporting events.

you on Saturday Nighr Live?

They made a big deal outofmeltleft me a
little embarrassed at times.They would always
make a big deal out of how I went off into
the world and pursued a very difficult career
and had a reasonable amount of success, and
they still make a big deal out ofit, you know.>
And it entbarrasses me a little bit, because I

want to say,
“Geez, come
on guys, not
this stuff
again." But
at the same
time I enjoy
it Iowa,
Cedar Frills
is very kind
to me and
allows me to
speak at col-
leges and high schoolsThey want me to be in
their organizations, things like that. And some
of that‘s because of the fact that I went out and
did these different things. I‘m enjoying the at»
tention.

The greatest minds and thinkers come
from all over the world. I just want them to
include lowa as a choice. That's my only miss
sion.I don’t want Iowa to just be shoved aside
I want to put it in the game and see it be a
choice. Iowa's just a piece of the world, but

what I found out is thatI can't change the
world. All I can do is change my part, and if
1 can affect the lives that surround me, maybe
as big as the borders ofthe state, then I think
itbeeomes a domino effect. My goal is to con-
tribute to the community I live in, and if that
contributes to the world at large, great. I’m
not going to be president now. That dream’s
probably gone away. But anyone that wants
to conquer the world~go for it., Maybe you
can conquer it from here There was a time
when if you wanted to write a script for Hols
lywood, you had to live in L.A., but now you
can write from anywhere.

Woo: rm of misconception: dopeop/e in Colin
form'n lmm about Iowa mm’ oicc ante?

The main misconceptions Iowans have,
particularly with L.A., is that they’re just a
bunch of jerky liberals out there. And that’s
really not the case. There are just as many Con-
servatives, good people and bad people as here.
The misconceptions they have about Iowui
and I hear them all the time—is that there’s
nothing to do herehthat we're just kind of
happy-go-lucky hicks. They’re surprised to
learn how educated we are. They’re surprised
to learn that there are world—class industries
here The world at large doesn't know that.
We haven’t done a greatjob of marketing Iowa,
but there’s an Iowan snobbery, too. We don’t
like people who put on airs and seem to be
false, and I think we tend to look at urban cen-
ters like Chicago, New York and LA, as false
and full of pretense. But they’re just people.

There were plenty of people like myself
who just wanted to be good people and hunt

those qualities. My friends were all people who

l barbequed with and joked with, and they
were from all over the country. They were like
me,just looking for the humanity in the midst
of all of it. And that’s all over LA. You really
find your own, even in a big city like that.

ant': going [0 bappm yyour kidr grow up
and wont to move In LA?

You know if his passion Isiwhatever it
is and wherever it takes him, I will support
him. To be an actor you have to really have no
choice. It’s like, “1 love performing so much.I
don’t care what the odds are. I’m gonna do it."
That’s the only way you’ll make it, to just have
that blind, crazy ambition, and if he has that,
rhen hegrudgingly I’ll accept it. But I'd rather
he be a doctor. ,
