While Grinncll has sometimes
been called a hotbed of radicalism and
revolutionary thought, if not pl'IlCthCr
in the instance orlohn caning de Mar
bior ’69, Grinnell can claim at least one
real revolutionary—and a successful one
at that.

Gatang. VicesPrBSident of Sudan
and former leader ofthe Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), died July 30
when the Ugandan presidential MI-72
helicopter he was riding in crashed in
the mountains of southern Sudan. Gas
rang’s untimely death came three weeks
after he was installed as vice-president
and only six months after signing a
peace agreement that ended 22 years of
civil war in Sudan.

Garang was born into the Dinka
tribe in southern Sudan and received a
scholarship to Grinnell in 1965. Robert
Grey, Political Science, taught Gatang
as a senior in 1969 and remembered
him as “very bright and ambitious."Jack
Dawson, Economics, who taught Gar
rang and also lived
with him in Africa
from 197071971,
said Gaiang was an
“outstanding stu-
dent and 0l|ISmild*
ing leader" who was
“truly charismatic."

Garang was a member of the ﬁrst
generation ofAfrican students to come
from many newly independent nae
tions to study in America. According to
Dawson, these students understood the
future responsibilities they could face,
“They never knew when they would be
called back to Africa and installed as
Secretary of State,”hc said.

Upon returning to Africa in 1969,
Garang studied as at Thomas]. Watson
Fellow at the University of Dar es Sa»

”[Garang was an] outstanding
student and outstanding leader”

ﬁghting in the ﬁrst Sudanese civil war.
After the first civil
war ended in 1972,
Garang was to
similated into the
Sudanese regular
army. For the next
11 years Garang was

a career military omeer; he also earned

his PhD, in Agricultural Economics
from Iowa State University in 1981.

In 1983, Garang was sent to quell
an uprising among southern Sudanese
soldiers. According to Dawson, these
soldiers were afraid that they would be
sent to fight in Iran, because Sudan had
just sided with Iran in the Iraq-Iran
war.

Instead of stopping the uprising,
Garang created a rebel movement, the

SPLA, which set off the second Suda-

ncse civil war that lasted until a peace
agreement was signed in January 2005.

Many, including Dawson, saw Gas
rang and the SPLA’s tight as an attempt
to end the traditional dominance ofthe
predominantly Muslim and Alabic
north over the Animist and Christian
African south, The SPLA's declared
aim is to establish a democratic, secular
government, but the SPLA and Gamng
have had detractors who made accusa-
tions of human rights abuses.

ln Garangs BBC obituary, Gill
Lusk, deputy editor of Africa Conn—
dential, who interviewed Gating sev-
eral times, said, “john Garang did not
tolerate dissent and anyone who dist
agreed with him or [he lcadcrship was
either imprisoned or killed."

Others accused Gumng's rebellion
as being economically driven since Sun
dan’s vast oil fields lie in the south.

Grey remembered Garang as “[mos
mated] to go back to Africa and use
his knowledge to make money" and
that he did “not cspousc any leftswing
rebel political beliefs, at least publicly. ”

Garang was instrumental in the
peace process and his death has tested
the stability of the peace, After his
death was announced, riots broke out
in southern Sudan and over 130 people
were killed,

Gilrang's successor, Sudan’s new
Vice PreSldent, Salva Knr Mayardit,
as reported on a Sudanese website,
was quoted in Sudanese dail' s saying
that there are three possibilities bet
hind the crash of Gamng’s helicopter:
bad weather conditions, human error,
or explosives placed in the helicopter.
But according to Dawson, in the inter
est ofpeace, it is best ifthe question of
whether Garang was assassinated go
unanswered.
