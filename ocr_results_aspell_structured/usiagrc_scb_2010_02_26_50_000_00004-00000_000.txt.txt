Moving in a similar trend with the
country, the college is cutting budgets and
raising (he comprehensive fee by over a
thousand dollars a year,

The budger for the 2011 ﬁscal year
was released to the Grinnell commur
nity on Feb. 17, introducing a number of
changes to the College’s finances.

One of the most signiﬁcant changes
was a three percent increase in the come
prehensive tuition fee,
raising the yearly cost

penditure between 2010 and 2011 of ap
proximately $620,000, primarily linked to
construction projects and maintenance.
Academic expenses were held down by the
way in which those funds are distributed.
“Unlike a lot of schools that basically
just told different departments and budget
managers, ‘Here’s your budget, now figure
out how you're gonna allocate it,‘ we went
ahead and did what we usually do with our
budget planning process." Sorror said.
Individual departs

“We maintained our
commitment to meeting
the full demonstrated ﬁr
nancial need of our stu-
dents, and that meant in-
creasing our financial aid
budget by 32.2 million,” said Vice Presi-
dent for Institutional Planning Marci
Sortor.

Another imporrant changc is the five
percent decrease in endowment contri-
burloni a $2,000,000 decrease in rev-
enueifor the second year running. In
accordance with the college's endowment
spending policy, the contribution may not
be adjusted more than this amount for any
given year, to buffer the College against
sudden decreases or increases in endow-
ment spending.

When planning for the 20094010
academic year, many faculty and staff sale
ary increases remained at a stable rate.
For the next year, however, a salary pool
of2.5 percent has been budgeted for rises

Allocations to student

“The SGA budget looks ﬁne, and 5",,
dent organizations' funding has been hard
ly affected by the minor cut in the Student
Activities fee in the past year, and overall
we've been able to shift around our money
so as to still serve just about every need
with minimal cuts," said SGA Assistant
Treasurer Gabe schechrer '12, who will be
come SGA Treasurer for next a year.

Tuition increases and budgetary cuts
are expected to level off as the economic
situation improves, but there are as yet no
deﬁnite plans for next year. -

“It’s still very early...so we have not
started to talk about what should the
FY2012 be like," Sortor said.
