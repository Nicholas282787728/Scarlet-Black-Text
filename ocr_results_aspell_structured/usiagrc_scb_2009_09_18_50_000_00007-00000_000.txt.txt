Royal Bangs brings interactiveshow

Ev CAIuA ECKLAND

Last Friday, Royal Bangs, of Knox-
ville, Tennessee, put on an energetic show
in Gardner Lounge. Grinnell was one or
the many shows they played as they tour
throughout the United States from Chile
forum to New \’.or1t

The tour corresponds with the release
of their sophomore album "Let .t Beep,"
which wcut out this past Tuesday,

hlusictilly, Royal Bangs conics from a
nurture of genres. The the piece group
tomhlues hard rock beats and highly
rhythmic and distorted electric guitar with
leading syntlt melodies. The end result is
an upbeat even jittery t‘usiou of rock. pop
and electronica styles.

Similar artists include Band of Skulls.
and cage the Elephant, although the level
of energy in every Royal Bangs song is
pretty unique.

. However, much of the crowd’s instant
enthusiasm can be attributed to Vincent
Geels '10, the Dj who opened for Royal '
Bangs. Geels began the night with some
alternative beats that quickly inspired peo-
pie to dance,

Not only did everyone seem to enjoy
his mot-mg, several wondered when he
would be playing in the future.

“I thought he did a great job Pcoplc
were really up and moving and I would
love to see hun play llariis," said Colin
h'IcCallIIm-Cook'll.

Royal Bangs played a casual show, with
pm t ofthe drum set down in the crowd and
the lead singer continually interacting with
the audience. And once they started play
ing, the hands close, d1ncc oriented energy
quickly infected the crowd

“At one point the lead singer got down
and was moving around through the crowd
and letting people add stuff into the min
crophone. So there was good syncrgv,"Mo
Cnllum said,

During the show, songs such as “car
Swallow, ' “Briinbow” and “VVarbclls,”
prompted thc crowd to iurnp, clap and even
mosh on the dance ﬂoor. These, as well as
some other good songs like Waking up
Weird” and “Maniverse” are on the band’s
niyspace page.

With an almost unanimously positive
crowd of 30 or 40. Gardner quickly heated
up and the bassist was shirtltss by the and
of the show.

However, the temperature had no effect
on the crowd who, immediately chanted
for an encore after the last song. The band
obliged with gusto, inviting the audience

Given Wavves, potentially undeserved
reputation for dramatics, last night's Cards

the Beach Boys on a cocktail of Ecstasy,
Valium and Xanax.

Instead, Wavves put on a cohesive, lo-
ft show with lyric-melding distortions and
enough heavy punk inﬂuences to back up
some committed head
