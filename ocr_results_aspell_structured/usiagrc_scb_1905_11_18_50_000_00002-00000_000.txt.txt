LARGE part of the suceers

ivliich the Grinnell iootball team
has attained this hill is due to the
taithiul workof those men who are
commonly termed Llle”ScrubS,” The
“Scrub”ls somewhat similar to the
man behind the gun. He goes out
every nigllt and gladly tillers his
services tor the sake oi the institution
and of the team. or course. every
Sci-uh cherishes the secret ambition
one day to becomeameuiber of the
Varsity, but attho same time heis
willing to rislr his life and limb in
crder that some other man may get
me training and experience by which
great iootball victories are made pos-
sihle. In times oi victory the Scrubs
aretorgotteu. Their names do not
appear on the roll of honor nor do the
papers publish their pictures, but
nevertheless they are the power he-
hind the throne, and without them a
victorious Varsity would be impossi—
ble. It is unusual thataman should
go through college and do iaithiul
workasaScrub and not get on the
Varsity, As a rule the man who has
been the Scrub tor a season or two
knows the game better and plays his
position more scientiﬁcally than the
player who becomesaVarsity man the
ﬁrst year. It requires courage, it
takes nerve to get out every night and
play against the Varsity which is con
sitlered to be or the championshiptype.
We honor the Scrubs ior their un-
swerring loyalty and iaitliiuluesslo
duty. Their perseverance is worthy
of the highest commendation. If in
after years they become members of a
famous Varsity, we predict that they
will never regret thetr experience as

The close relation between college
and town in Grinnell was illustrated
at the Uncle Sam Club Beneﬁt at the
Colonial last Tuesday evening when
ten or those who gave their services on
program were Iowa College students
or faculty, who were absolutely un-
connected with the town in any other
way. The [act that they so gladly
gave their services tor what was purely
a local institution, sneaks well tor the
