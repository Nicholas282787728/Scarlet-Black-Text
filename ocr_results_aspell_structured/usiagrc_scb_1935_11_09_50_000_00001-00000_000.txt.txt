Classical Music Played
in Exceptional
Manner

By Richard Kulicl

Edith Lorand and her Hungarian
orchestra presented a colorful and
fiery musical program in Thurs-
day evening's concert at Herrick
chapel, The director herself was
outstanding and even approached
the conspicuous; yet her personale
ity was in harmony with a good
deal of the music she played and
directed.

It was easy to misunderstand
the impression she made, Although
gowned attractively, she was
shocking to some, and amusing to
others~perhaps in the way she
manipulated the yards of red chif-
fon at her feet. Even if she did
give the impression of an operatic
soprano, she was successful in
leading her orchestra through an
eventful evening.

Proper Style

Handel's “Sarabande” introduced
the program and was done with
the proper broad and pompous
style of that early 18th century
composer. In fact, the orchestra
was exceptional in its interpreta—
tion of the classics. Beethoven.

Preps Begin

‘Colorful, Fiery Program Given
by Hungarian Orchestra’

[Mozart and Mendelssohn, as well
‘as Handel were done with finish: it
is a comparatively easy matter to
detect artistry in an orchestra of
this size.

The Beethoven “C o u n t r y
Dances" were delightful, the three
solo instruments leading the hair
ance of the orchestra, The last of
the classic group, “Scherzo" from
“Midsummer Night’s Dream" was
pleasant and familiar to many,
both factors contributing undoubt-
edly to its popularity.

Hungarian Dances Colorful

The section of the program en-
titled “Hungarian Dances." was
imbued with strong color (preter—
ably a vivid red) and was punctuc
ated by strict and extremely pro-
nounced rhythm. These qualities.
together with the high speed, could
not help making an indelible and
favorable impression upon the aud—
ience. The three selections com-
prising the group were so com-
pletely flaming and vigorous that
the audience did not realize fully
the excellent interpretation of the
group; they were too interseted in
the listening. The Hungarian in-
strument called the tarogeto. in-
troduced in the 11th century Hun-
garian melodies, might have been
a forerunner of the modern saxo-
phone. It’s tones were surprizingly
similar.

The Viennese dance group car-
ried the audience into a lilting and
swinging mood, as well as a whirl-

Bryant Reverses Procedure;
Fires Many Questions at Interviewer

 

“Ten years from now, what
fields will demand the most intel.
ligont people?” asked Stewart P.
Bryant, retired naval officer. re-
versing thc usual order of things
by questioning his interviewer Fri~
day afternoon. He went on to
lanswer his own questio : ”Govern-
;mcnt, foreign diplomatic service,
journalism, cinema education and
thc radio have the power of mak-
ing or ruining the future of the
world."

In the hands of intelligent young
men and women, these six institu»
ti ns can shape the minds of the
entire world for the betterment or
destruction of civilization, he be~
lieves. His being stationed in
many parts of the world, from Si»
beria to Constantinople, has caused
him to adopt this belief.

Ghnporons Women’s College

Chapeonlng a women's college
in Constantinople during the World
War was only one of the incidents
of his varied career. it was an

 

American college, although the stu-
dents were of 16 different nation-
alities, and Bryant was stationed
there to discourage the Turkish
army from using the school build-
ings, particularly the barns, for
barracks.

When the Turkish army attemp ‘
ed to move in anyway, he said, thel
woman in charge of the school had
the roofs taken off the barns, malt-
ling them useless ror military use.

Flew Around World.

Lieutenant-commander Bryant
ltook part in the first amiy flight
laround the world in 1923. at an-
other time he was commander of
the Mayﬂower, fonnerly the pri-
vate yacht of the president.

'As he and Dr, Yusuke Tsurumi
were exchanging comments on
world affairs, they discovered that
they had been present at the same
conference in Tokio several years
ago and had even sat at the same
table, although they did not meet.
