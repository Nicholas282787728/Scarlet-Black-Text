AN ALL-COLLEGE BULL SESSION

Thc climax of the attempt to have victo ' day
after Grinnell’s will over Creighton was reached
in the Colonial theater Monday morning, when acts
given by three of the men’s halls turucd tllc show
into an all-college hull session. The bounds of pro
priety and decency were overstepped, and as a rcr
still: the opinions of Grinncll coeds for the
three buildings were nil.

The only form of making partial amends for
the acts given, that of asking tllc apology of the
quadrangle members taken by the hollsc chair-
-lncn through a Iettcl‘ addressed to the womcn of
Grillucll college. Some commendation is due the
men for their approval at dinner Monday evening
of such a move, but r Jrimand is certainly (luc
those who were responsible for tllc ”worse than
burlesque” skits. _

Mismanagument of a second victory (lily \Vllll-
ill the last two years should touch Grillllcll students
the need of organization and, more than ever, the
absolute necessity of the endorsement of sonic or-
ganization ou the campus. The student» council
Sunday afternoon discussed the possibility of _zl
victory day, but no vote was taken on the proposr-
tion. It was that body’s duty to either approve or
disapprove of the plan. With its endorsement all
organized victory day would have been assured,
while with its ofﬁcial vote against: such a sugges-
tion the subject would have been dropped from
campus thought. 4

As the situation turned ollt the council rcr
maincd silent. No other student organization is
representative of the campus at large, alld collscr
quently the attempt. to get. the backing of the neu -
ly organized Pionccr club, the Lantern, or the
Council of house chairmen was futile

CLIPPl'NG IN FRIDAY’S GAME

There have been rumors on the Grinllcll cam»
pus that a Creighton player intentionally clipped
Russell Ruff to c ipplc him ill tllc Ihomocouuug
game here Frida ' t. When some students saw
Ruff limping cal .v i the some, and saw him help-
cd from the field later in the game, they \villldcl'ctl

ball, but it does not slap a chap down with the
some lilotivc a inurderov has when he pvclllcditatcs
the slitting of an cllclny’s throat.

The Blllojays merely crackch on Ruff the
wrong Why. You often can crack down a man tho
wrong way, and still be given the bcuufit .nf the
doubt as to whether there was guilt ill your heart.
It was merely bec use it wt. Ruff that it looked
bad. Creighton. after falling to puncture tho Piou-
cer line in its best chance for a score during the
opening session, had to stop Ruff or lose. Back in
1928 it had a taste of Rllff’s p llg, when he
pulled frolll behind a two touchdown disadvantage
by passing for three scores during the game.

Maybe Creighton was merely too cllthl
in its intention to stop Ruff. Football player
often goaded on into sort of a mania by coaches
and alumni. But Coach Stark wouldn’t tell them
to stop him that way. Art Stork is too much of a
sport. He would prefer that lie be stopped the
other wayiin his tracks before he could pass, or
by having the receivers covered.

After all, Ruff or not, the Blucjays were heat-
ben, and they took their medicine like sportsmen.
It was/their second straight trimming at the hands
of the Pioneers, and they handled it more graccr
fully than some of the teams the Grinncll players
could name. Thcy watched Douglas, Thomas, and
Ullrich slip through the hands of their tacklcrs
like money through the hands of a drunken sailor,

SPORTS AND CHARITY
(From the Davenport Demo‘rnt)

If anyone had wanted to put the Big Ten football
managers in a hole, he couldn’t have done it better than
by giving them the chance they had to refuse to be
bound by technicalities, and to sanction the playing of
the Northwestern-Notre Dame game on Soldiers field,
the big Chicago stadium, that the excess proﬁts from
the game might be given to charity. I‘hey declined.

At a time when everyone should help in whatever
efforts will ameliorate the situation for families that
will be in want during the coming wintcr, this Was an
outstanding instance of lack of both sympathy and
understanding.

Let's See, isn’t. this the same bunch that was so
souctimonious a year or so ago about the matter of pay-
ing a few dollars to help through college the big boys
who could play football? It seems to be, one got the
idea that some of them weren't very good spars then,
and the opinion is conﬁrmed by the verdict that holds
the Northwestern game to the Evanstou ﬁeld.

EMBARRASSING ATTENTION
(From the Keolzuk Gate City)

American impulsiveness is shown in the way in
which the dollars are pouring in to the special Commit
tee appointed by Mayor Walker of New York City for
the loving cup for Sir Thomas Lipton suggested by Will
Rogers. More than $5,000 has been received to date.
all in $1 gifts, and the funds still arrive.

Without questioning the sincerity behind the pro-
ject one may still wonder whether sir Thomas may not
find that this method of expressing affection somewhat
embarrassing. It may appear like a rather painful re-
minder of his failure to attain the real ambition of his
life. It would be something like the Winner of the World
series pennant presenting a gold piece to each member
of the losing team. Consolation prizes, in other words,
seldom console.

It is important that the cup be proffered to Sir
Thomas, not as a substitute for the one that be has
vainly attempted to lift, but as a spontaneous expression
of reward. It: is not meant to atone for his disappoint-
ment. on the sea, but as an evidence of the American
people’s friendship. He should be m'ade to feel that even
if he had won the race, the American people Would still
have found in Sir Thomas certain qualities that they
admire and emulate. .

That. is the spirit that is, or should be, behind the
gift. It should be more than a mere mob impulse, to
which the American people are prone, which leads them
to sudden bursts of exalted energy, followed by blissful
forgetfulnessvas some new interest comes along.

It is a fine thing to be “Johnny-on-the-spot,”
but ill Chicago it’s mighty dangerous.

1930,

The little Pioneers have shown big'Siuger's ability as broken field 'ruzi-

improvement during their last three
practices, and although their plays are
not working with much precision, still
they should be able to put a reason-
ably strong team against the Bullr
pups. The local preps have not play-
ed on outside school so far this year,
while Drake lost a 12-6 decision to
an unusually strong Creighton iresh~
man team.
Loko Out of Game

Coach John Truesdale is uncer-
tain 0 this exact. starting Imup, but
it is probable that Welsh and Crews
will start at ends, Eat and Trumr
bull at tackles, Rosenbloom and Er—
win at guards, Faunoe at center,
Waite or Singer at quarterback,
snnti, Loynnchen or Sauna at half—
backs, and Rose or Crawford at
fullbacks. Lake, giant tackle from
Massachusetts, will not see action
against Drake because of injuries
sustained from scrimmage,

From watching the yearling team
in action, it looks as though the lit-
tle Pioneers will stick to straight
football, depending on the ability of
Rose to hit the line, and Waite and
