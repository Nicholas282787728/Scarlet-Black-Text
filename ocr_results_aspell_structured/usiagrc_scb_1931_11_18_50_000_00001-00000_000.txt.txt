‘End of Age’ Economist’s
Subject in Chapel

Tomorrow

Stuart Chase, economist and writ—
er, will speak on “The End Of an
Age?" Thursday evening at eight

i o‘clock in Herrick chapel. This is the
second number of the Grinnell col-
lege lecture course.

Mr. Chase, a graduate of Harvard
University, 1910, previously attended
Massachusetts Institute of Technol-
ogy. For a number of years he was
a public accountant; he investigated
the meat industry under the Federal
Trade Commission, from 1917 to

‘. 1922; for the last nine years he has
been head of the Labor Bureau.
Chase Against Machines

These varied experiences have
caused the economist, who is any-
thing but a theorist, to form some
very decided ideas about the status
Of modern industry. Machines are
a frequent subject of attack from Mr.
Chase, the book “Men and Machines"
being one of his latest.

In his opinion, though machines
have given us a higher standard of
living, shorter working hours, and
lengthened the average span of life.
these benefits are minimized because
of the “mechanized warfare” and de-

‘ pression which has resulted. He vis-
ualizes machines as horrible consum-
ers of natural products, monstrosi-
ties that make robots of men, re-
dnring all people to the some dead
level of the slavish convention in
clothes, games, everything.

Recently Talked on Mexico

In a recent lecture, “Machineless
Men”, at Washington University, St.
Louis, Mr. Chase, who has just
written a book on economic Candie
tions in Mexico, compared the econ-
omic civilization of a typical Mexican
city with that of a typical American
city. He thinks that in Mexico the
fundamental economic civilization
founded by the Mayas and Aztecs is
in solidarity and comprehension,

' comparable to our own situation. Te-
paztlan, the Mexican city cited by
Mr. Chase, relies upon agriculture

- .and handicraft for livlihood, rather
than some one highly specialized in-
dustry.

The food of these people is a mine I
_bean»squash mixture assuring econ-'
omic independence. They have a
drink called ”pulque", a fermented
stuff made from the juice ot the cene
tury plant, known to contain evcry
vitamin now discovered. The lectur-
er admittetl, however, that Tepoztlan
has an appalling death rate, that it
is easy on the eyes but hard on the
nose,

Decentralization, His Cure

Besides the books already men~
tioned, Stuart Chase wrote in 1925
‘his volume on conservation, “Tragedy
of Waste”. with another economist
as coauthor, he produced “Your
Money’s Worth".

Mr. Chase's cure for the depression
would be decentralization. He would
have factories made smaller, cities
made smaller. These cities, with their
immediate vicinity, would form
economic units.

The next speaker on the lecture
course will be Norman Forester, dean
of the college of letters at the Uni-

- versity of Iowa. He will talk Dec.
4 on "Koethe and Human Letters To-
day", in connection with the com-
memoration of the onerhundfedth
anniversary of the death of Goethe.

Salmond Shows Mastery of Violoncello
in Recital in Herrick Chapel Tuesday

By HARRY w. MATLAClt
(Professor of Organ)

Musiciansbip of extraordinary dis
tinction and a mastery of the violon-
cello surpassed by not more than one
—and that one the superhuman Pubs
lo Casals—of the virtuosi who have
been heard in Herrick chapel, were
the conspicuous features of Felix Sal-
mond’s recital last evening, the sec-
ond in this year's series or artists‘ re-
citals managed by the department of
music. ,

Mr. Salmond approaches his play
ing with a devotion that is unsurpass-
ed; he immerses himself to the point
of forgetfulness of his environment
when he is playing, and as a conse~
quence his playing is of the intro-

Council to Allow
Town Men Right

of Representation

Drnke .
Oklahoma
Grinuell

At a meeting of the student coun-
cil, held Sunday evening, it was de
cidcd that students living in town
should be represented by a man and
woman on the council, Lee Alexan—
der, president of the council announc-
ed today. Town men and town wom-
cn will each elect one of their group
to represent them on the council.

This decision came after the men
town students had adopted a resolu-
tion at a meeting several weeks ago
asking for representation. Alfred
Canard, town men’s chairman pre-
sented it. Thc women are now repre-
sented on the council by Faith Sum<
ers.

At the meeting, also, a committee
was appointed to make plans for a
victory day, which will be held next
Monday, if Grinnell beats Drake.
Members of the committee are:
Roberta Vance, chairman; Stanley
Hipp, and Ruth Goodenow.

The next council meeting will be
held on the first Sunday after
Thanksgiving, Mr. Alexander Said.

.spective rather than the demonstra-
tive t‘y—pe, That being the case, it is
evident that only a personality of
unique power can draw his listeners
with the inteutness that followed Mr.
Salmond.

Educational Stimulus

His program was built along con-
ventional lines, but of highly uncona
ventional compositions, so far as
'oello music goes, for even the great
sonata by Brahms can hardly be call-
ed conventional. Such an event is
an educational stimulus of the first
rank, for while perhaps it is too much
to hope that even a few at the stu-
dents who heord Mr. Salmond, and
his gifted associate Ralph Angeli, will
reach the pinnacle which he shares
with only a few other artists, it is in»
disputable that the revelation of what
the ’Cello can do should stimulate a
much greater desire to take up that
instrument.

Examples of modern treatment of
’Cello, as in the last group, compar-
able with recent innovations in the
ﬁeld of Stringrquhrtet music, with
their brittle harmonic effects and at-
tenuated discords, were charmingly
given by Mr. Salmond, and in these,
as in all the other pieces, the unity
between himself and his accompan-
ist was strikingly demonstrated. It
is not sufficient that the accompanist
be a fine musician and pianist—he
must be the same type of musician as
the artist whom he accompanies.

Accompanist Fralsed

He must submerge himself in the
soloist’s interpretation, but he must
be more than a shadow, and it is not
hard to imagine the hours and hours
of working together and Self»critic-
ism that made possible such a per-
fect ensemble as we heard between
Mr. Salmond and Mr. Angeli. The
Brahms sonata, for example, calls for
share and share alike in its interpre-
tation, and its nobility could not have
been achieved had either of its par
ticipants failed to realize its values.

Grinnell has been known for many
years for its high standing in the
liberal arts world, but there is a
chance to prove the worth of the
school and its students in manual
labor.

In 1921, an unknown donor gave to
Crinnell and Drake an old oaken
bucket to be owned jointly by the
two schools. To be in the possession
of the school which won the annual
game between the two. The scores
of the games are on the sides of the
bucket, in blue and white for the
games which Drake wins, and scar»

Drake has kept possession of it.

Freshman Gridiron Game

in Drake Stadium

Grinnell‘s frosh eleven will not be
hampered by ineligibilities in the

the Drake stadium. Coach John
Truesdale announced today that all
but three of the freshmen arc eligi—
ble and that none will be kept out
of the game on account of injuries,

0n the line McMillin will be at the
pivot post, while Durham, Edsall,
and Safris are working at guard
positions, Morgan and Meeter, tack-
les, and Phelps and Brown at ends
will undoubtedly complete the for-
ward wall,

Finl and Hayden will swap places
at fullback, with Clark, Smelser,
Crews, Kingery and Wirtanen taking
turns at the rest of the backfield po—
sitions. Edsall, injured in the Tutor
game last Friday, will be back in his
guard position again, and Hayden,
who was missed in the tutor yearling
game will also be in the backfield.

The backfield is heavier than it has
been before averaging about 180
pounds. Thc frosh have been using

Saturday evening, Captains of the
two teams will be the principals in
the ceremony.

So of course, if we are to have an
old oaken bucket, is moss-covered
bucket we must have a well to hang
it in. All applicants for the job of
digging the well, and the suggestions

for suitable sites will be gladly rc-
ccived.

The well at Drake that contains
the much contested bucket is grad-
ually sinking into disrepair. Reports
state that the chain holding the
bucket is neztlly worn through. Why
not promise to give the bucket a
brand new well and a brand new
chain if it will come to Crinncll this

Yeager Talks

to Scientists

Naturalist Gives History

of Park System

In telling of our national park ser-
vice, Dorr G. Yeager, park naturalist,
related the story of the inception of
Yellowstone Park and our national
park system, at a meeting of the
Grinnell Science club in Alumni Reci-
tation ball auditorium, Monday ever
ning.

Mr. Yeager, who is connected with
the Rocky Mountain National Park,
distinguished between it and the Na
tional Forest service. The latter is
supervised by the department of
agriculture, while the park service is
under the interior department and is
primarily interested in conservation
of scenic and historical country and
animals.

In March 1372, he said, a group of
men were discussing what should be
done with the Yellowstone area and
the idea came to them to combine

Drake Tilt Ends

Gridiron Career
for Six Seniors

Six seniors will be on the Pioneer
football squad that goes to Drake
university for the final game on the
Crinnell grid schedule this year. Os-
car Christoffersen, captain, will be at
his usual post at center for the last
time, while Hank Thomas Will be
making his final bid for Missouri
Valley conference honors from the
quarterback position.

Charlcs Bilto, veteran tackle, and
DeWitt McCreary, halfback, are the
other two lettermen who will end
their collogiatc gridiron activities
Saturday afternoon. All have been
on the Grinnell football squad since
their sophomore year.

Paul Edman, end, and Frank
Spangler, a back, are the other two
seniors, although they have as yet
to win their varsity letter in foot-
ball, ,

Otto Colz, who won a letter in
track last year, will not bc able to
play in the closing game because of
injuries received in the first contest
of the year with Coe college. He is
also a senior.

Drake Reserving Tickets .
at Dance for Grinnelliwns

According to The Timesnelphic,
Drake student publication, 1011 tick-
ets for the Drake homecoming dance
Saturday night are being reserved
for Grinnell college students. The
price is $1 a couple.

The drincc will be held in the Scots
tish-kiite Temple, and the ceremony
of presenting thc “Old Oaken Buck-
et" to the captain of the winning foot-
ball team will take place there. The
Drake “D" club is in charge of the
dance.

 

Pioneers Drill

for Drake Tilt
Next Saturday

Closing Game for Grinnell;
Rain Halts Workout
Yesterday

Dick Illlrich, veteran halfback, re—
turned to the Pioneer team Monday
for practice. He has been out for
three weeks with a broken bone in
his right foot. Even though Coach
L. L. (Fuzz) Watt will be able to use
him against the Bulldogs Saturday.
Ullrich‘s playing will be limited to
carrying the ball as he is still not
equal to return to his duties of punt-
ing for the Pioneers .

Opposing DrakE’s veteran line,
which is complete from end to end
with lettermcn, with the exception
of Macy Baker, sophomore guard, the
Pioneers will have only two men who
have seen service in Crinnell games
in previous years. They are Captain
Oscar Christoffersen, at center, and
Charles Bilto, tackle.

Veteran hockfield May Start

However, the Pioneers have a
wealth of sophomore material. Abe
Rosenbloom has won a permanent po.
sition at guard, as well as Hank
Duncan, who is experiencing his first
year of football, at end. McKee, a
sophomore, is at the other end, while
Canavan, Lake, and Could, tackles,
are all second year men. Figland
and Martin, alternating at the other
guard post, are juniors,

If Coach Watt does use Ulllicb, a
veteran Pioneer backfield will meet
the Bulldogs, at least for part of the
game. Thomas will hold his quarter-
back position, McCreary and llllrich
will be at halfback, and Graflund will
play fullback. Rose, James, and Al-
exander are also sure of seeing ac-
tion. '

Drake Line Heavier

Injuries have handicapped the Grins
nell gridders throughout the season,
but now Coach Watt has an entire
squad free from injuries with the ex-
ception of otto Golz, who injured his
knee in the opening game of the year
with Coe college, and Trumbull, who
is out with an injured shoulder.
Reports from the Bulldog strong-
hold indicate that the average
weights in the two backfields are
about even, but the Drake aggrega
tion has a 13 pound advantage in the
line, on the average. If the weather—
man frowns on the contest Saturday,
this additional weight may prove ‘a
big factor in deciding the contest.
The Pioneers have a slight ad—
vantage ou the record books for
previous games won this season, win»
hing five out of seven starts against
the Bulldogs' four out of seven.
Drake has gained a total of 71 points
against its opponents 153, although
high scores were run up by Notre
Dame, Fordham, and Missouri.

Drnlrc May Claim Croim

Grinncll has piled up 94 points,
while opponents have been held to
64, but those 64 points were gained
in three games. St. Louis university
ran up 43 points, Carleton 13, and
Creighton eight. The other four
games were shutouts for Pioneers.

lf Drake wins the contest Satur-
day, it will be in a position to claim
the Missouri Valley conference crown,
as the Bulldogs will have won three
games and lost none. Oklahoma Ag-
gies played only one valley member
this season, Creighton. Although
the Aggies won from Creighton, they
do not meet Drake this year.

DRAMA GROUPS MEET

The dramatic council and thc Na-
tional Collegiate Players met Monday
night in Alumni Recitation ball to
plan their publicity campaign for
George Bernard Shaw's play, “The
Apple Cart,” which is to be presented
Dec, 8 in the high school auditorium
by the New York Theatre Guild and
iinder the sponsorship of the Nation~
a1 Collegiate Players. Mr. Colbert, as-
sistant professor of journalism, will

 

assist with the campaign.
