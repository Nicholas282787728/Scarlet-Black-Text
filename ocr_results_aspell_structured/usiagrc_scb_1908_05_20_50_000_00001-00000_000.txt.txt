hell was the worst oncndcr in this res
spect. Carncv and Greenwood who are
usually so steady seemed to he inc
dulging in a little balloon ascension
all oi their‘ own.

support would have won his

ed ball ear 'n the game. The change
in the line-up by which 0. Barber went
back [0 his old place at third base,
Smithson to short stop and Ham-
mond to left ﬁeld seems lor the better.
Hammond was especially helpful,

Parker, who twirlcd for Cornell,
pitched a good heady game. No other
stars were noticeable in their team
which seemed to be of about equal
ahilitl‘.

Each team scored once in the ﬁrst
inning and Grinuell added Mr Seas
and and last in the tliii d, hoth scores
being made by c. Barber. in the sixth
inning. on a series of errors, are -
throws, and passcd balls, Cornell ac-
cumulated three more runs to which
they added anothcr iu the seventh.
Twice after this Griniiell had men on
third and with excellcnt chances to
score but poor stick ability and ef-
fective pitching prevented any such
iiccnrciiccs. ,

Saturday alter-noon, in spitc ol rainy
weather, a one sided but interesting
nest n held on Ward Field. As vias
doped bciare Gl‘lllllell took all the
sprints and hurdles, .ncCoi-d being out
or the meet, and a rather sur-p
lecture was the distance runs
por-iorrnance at a 4.42 pace is to be
commended. While the iwcauile (ti.
10,29 was a slll‘pl'iseitldo' in both
racos it was quite ovidrni that ’l‘lloml)~
son was not doing his best. Ziegler
showed up well in the weights and it
looks now as tho drlnncll could hope
tor a tow points in weights at the
State Meet. The mile relay came to
Gr-inncll tlrri. disqualiﬁcmion.

Taken on a whole the meet can not
be corisidcred as a criterion of tlic
relative strcngth oi the two teams, It
was too plainly mident that Drake
was not doing her best. The Gr-innell
men are not at their best yet, hut
Saturday's rncct showed what couzd be
expected at the state Meet.

t the coming May Festival thc stll»
dent ct lowa Collcge and.all others
- , dent in this vicinity Will have an
Jililultlllllu' 01' listening to one of the
great arched-as oi the world. The
number or organizations of the char»
rotor and magnitude oi the one that
stands as a living monument to the
memory oi Theodore Thomas is. nee»

oar y limited .A large private sn-
donmcnt or a government subsidy is
,nvariably i-euuisiic to ﬁnance such a
project and besides there must he a
considerable number or patrons.
whose attendance can be relied upon
year alter year. Consequently, it is
only on rare occasions that orchestra

oncerts of the best quality are to he
heard outside oi the large centers of
population.

There s no more interesting music
in existence than that which has been
composed or arranged lor the orches-

and surely none wiich makes a
wider appeal. The va y in the qual-
oi tone produced by the various
instruments makes possible every
lnown musical aiicci and combination
And the number or these ellccts and
(tillllilllntiolls is n 'olllLtvly limitless.
.\ll\‘alle \\Iltl Ll ‘L‘S pleasure iron] the
pin lug oi a good band (and who does
not) will ﬁnd cvcn greater ciiiovment
in a ﬁnely equipped orchestra, with its
nrtiunely larger possibilities, A linonl
edge of music or a musical cducatiorr
is iigt i-cnuircdilor a very lull ap-
preciation ot’ orchestral music, and
lllrlse to whom the piniloge or hearing
such has not hither-to cornc riced not
hesitate about attending the approach
ing concerts in tho icar that the music
will be technical and urinrtcrcsting.
The programs havc heel] sch , .d with
the greatest care and the music to be
presented will prove rich and melod-
ious [0 an unexpected degree.

The Chicago oi-chcsi-n today has an
cndonrucnt oi thr-cc-ouartcrs oi it lllllr
lion dollars raised bi’ ‘ropulnr snpr
scriprion in 190 a, something lun-
(0,000 people contributing to the hind,
it has its own homo, the lieautilul and
adequate Orchestra liall. where each
year- a‘ scr s or lorty orchestra culls
carts are given tosthcr with numerous
recitals and oratorios. it represents
unquestionably Chicago's ﬁnest
achievement up to this time Theodore
Thomas lived to conduct only two coir
certs in the new building that had
been his dream iov years, but he was
lor-tunatc in being spared long enough
to see his ideal become a roali , And
whim he (lied he had, with urisrring
judgment, chosen a incst competent
successor. Under the leadership or
Frederick AJStock, who at the time oi~
his promotion was a member or the
orchestra, playing the viola, the Theo»
ilore Thomas Orchestra has increased
greatly in public favor and holds to
lay a loremost place in the musical
life oi America The opportunity or
hearing this great organization is one
which no one can aiiord to miss. but
the least interesting tcature oi‘ the
occasion will be the chance of hearing
the Orchestra under the direction oi
three different conductor-s, Stock,
Mr. Edward E. SLheVe and lir. George
i. Pierce. '

it we were able to attend these con-
certs in Grinnell at the usual ci
prices or $1 to $1.50 per seat for each
concert we siioiild even then be most

rorninaie in having the best music
thiit r.- available brought to our very
door But in view oi the very low
pric charged tor the course tickets,
it i. bclievcd that no one. understand-
ing rhc situation, will tor-ego a single
number The educational value of the
Festival, in view oi the eyceptionar‘
merit of the talent presented, can nut
be over estimated The ﬁnancial bur—
dell is a large one, hut one that this
wcll-todo community is or ' , able to
hear, ii it so desires.

lar exercise or physical training is a
hunger, no doubt soincwliat‘due to
tho cliniaterbut it also seems to be
due to his nature to take spasmodic
games and to recoil lronr steady prac-
tice at any sport.

At Thanksgiving time there is held
at Cathlialogan a teacllel‘s' Normal
which is attended by about three
hundred Flliliillo teachers besides
many American teachers. For Thanks»

the series oi eight or nine events was
ﬁnished. This. the ﬁr t ﬁeld meet in
