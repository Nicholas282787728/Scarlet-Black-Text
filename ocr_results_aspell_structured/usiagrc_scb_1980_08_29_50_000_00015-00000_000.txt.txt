The service directory, a handbook of
available services which might be
useful to students, will also he offered
around the October break. The
directory, listing services offered by
the} college, the SGA, and local
businesses, is not meant to advertise,
but simply to provide intormatlon.

The record service, offering records,
empty tapes, and accessories at
discounts to students, will begin about
Sept. 1. Students may then go to the
SGA office to place their orders.
Campbell expects the SGA to be able to
otter an improved, more eiticient
record service this year, since she
spent much of the summer looking for
ways to improveit and is very conhdent
about her staff.

Campbell explained one imr
provement in the area of record
delivery, “In the past students had to
check with the Coordinator's Office
frequently in order to tind out when
thew records Came ln “Under our new
system," she promised, “we will notify
each person twice through the campus
mail when their order arrives and in-
clude a list of hours when they may
pick up thelr selections.”

Students may buy and sell used
textbooks and other books at the SGA’S
used book sale Sept, 7 in North Lounge
The sellers may bring their books to the
North Lounge before the sale and pick
up unsold books and profits at the SGA
office afterwards.

Campbell hopes to offer a Christmas
airline charter to and from New York,
but does not yet have complete in-
tormation on prices and other iactors.
She affirms that her office will provide
an October break shuttle to Des Molnes,
Chicago, and other places, however.

Campbell is optimistic about the
Services her offices will be offering this
year, “I think we’ve got some really
good student services," She said. “I've
spent the whole summer working on
various problems trom last year and i
feel I have a good staff ” She added that
she is inviting taculty members as well
as students to use these services.
