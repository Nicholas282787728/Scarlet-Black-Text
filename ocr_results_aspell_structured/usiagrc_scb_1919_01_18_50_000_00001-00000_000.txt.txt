return who has been wounded, and has
probably been in action more than any
other Grinnellian.

Like most or the ﬁghters, Tuttle
seeins disinclined to talk of his ex
oericnces. But the story of what the
famous Fiith and Sixth regiments of
the Marine corps did at Chateau
Thierry and Bellau wood is well known

merican public, and in France

men are called the “Saviour:
of Paris." Tuttle was with the Sixth
regiment at Ballean wood, and it was
there that he was wounded. Within
that month of ﬁghting about half or
the 15,000 men involved were killed
and every man was wounded, most of
them time and time agai . The two
regiments were cited in orders, and
every man awarded the Croix de_
Guerre.

At l’iu‘is Islltlltl.

Tuttle left school two years ago this
spring and went to Paris island with
a number of other Grinnoll mcn. After
training there he went to Quantico,
and embarked for France about tout-e
teen months ago. On the sixteenth of
March he went into the front line
trenches for the ﬁrst time, in the Vel'»
dun sector. He says that this sector
was quiet, the Germans shelling them
only at intervals, and raids being car-
ried out but seldom. From March
until June Tnttlc was on front line
duty, with a rest of two weeks in May,
on various parts of the line.

It was on June sixth that the Fifth
and Sixth regiments were ordered to
attack at Belleau woods, the Germans
having been stopped and a counter at—
tack advisable. The battalion of
which Tuttle was a machine gunner
was ordered to proceed through a
small French town held by the Ger-
mans, and to seize the railway station
and “dig in." Another battalion was
to take the town and clear it of Gcl'r
mans. The attack was made to the
left of the wood, across a wheat ﬁeld.
The men moved to the attack “in as
pretty a formation as if they were at
drill": on a little ways, then down out
or sight among the grain, up altogether
at the command of the officers. and on
farther.
