“Just come back safe”

av SARAH PIERCE

Paul ShumansMoore‘T)? has been missing since
early Monday morning. volunteers and emergency
personnel have been searching both on and offcam-
pus without success since Shuraan—Moore was re-
ported missing late Monday night,

“we had over 400 searchers assisting us today,"
said Grinneii ChiefofPolice Jody Matherly in a press
conference Wednesday. “We’ve left no stone unturned
and we still can’t find him."

Mike Horrcll '09, ShumansMoorc's roommate,
last saw ShumansMoore just before 8:30 p.m. Sunday
night.

Shuman-Moore spent late Sunday evening at
a small party in an apartment downtown. Francis
O'Rourke ’08 said Shuman-Moore looked like he
was having a good time. “He seemed to be genu-
inely happy and enjoying himself,"
O’Rourke said.

Matherly said ShumansMoore
was last seen at 1:23 a.-m. on Mon-
day morning. “He was on campus
going towards his dorm when
a couple students saw him last,"
Matherly said.

Harrell felt alarmed after not
seeing Sliuman-Moore all day
Monday and searched their Lazier
4th room for some sign of where his roommate had
gone He found a note from Shuman-Moore on his
desk and notiﬁed East Campus RLC Billy Kennedy,

who called security.

Security gaiards began searching, both on and
off campus, and alerted friends of Shuman-Moore,
including members of the Grinnell college Frisbee
team, ofwhich ShurnaneMoore is a member,

Several members ofthe team searched the campus
on foot Others soon joined them, and they split into
three groups to search the area by
cart
At daylight Tuesday morning
the search was orpaaded A com-
mand center was set up at the See
curity office. Volunteers as well as
formal investigators went out in
groups, searching the campus, the
town and the surrounding miles
on foot.

Around 30 people helped look
for ShamansMoore Tuesday. Police also sent up air-
planes for aerial searches and thermal scans at night,
but nothing was found.

Jody Maiherly,

SliumanvMoore's parents were notiﬁed on Tues
day and soon traveled to Grinnell.

On Wednesday, hundreds ofvolunteers turned out
at 7 am. to comb the area.

A‘There has been a huge outpouring from his
friends, family [and] people that didn't know him but
are concerned because he is one of our community
members and people from outside our community,"
Matherly saidt ,

Despite the large number or searchers, few solid
leads turned up. Police had scattered reports of sight~
ings as far away as ShumanrMoore's hometown of
Chicago, but none ofthe leads panned out.

On Thursday, authorities changed the search pat-
tern from sweeps involving large numbers of volune
tears to targeted searches aimed at focusing on hard
tossearch areas and checking out leads.

In addition, the search command center was
moved from the Grinncll Security office to the
Grinnell Public Safety building in town at 611 4th
Avenue.

Instead of taking all volunteers who showed up,
Mathcrly asked interested volunteers to contact Secus
rity and submit their name and contact information,
When he needs searchers, he will contact people on
the list.

“We have received a lot oflcads from different ar-
eas. We are trying to digest the information we have
received so far,” said Mathetly. “We do encourage the
