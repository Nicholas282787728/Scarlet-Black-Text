such as the world has not known for generations.
\Vitll millions out of work and impoverished ill
all industrial countries, with governments in a
panic seeking eleventh-honi- palliatives for confli~

with the universal d‘ rediting‘ of hitherto respect

itise telling us that the world ill on the brink of
chaos. that our civilization is doomed. it 100 s as
if there were no recourse for the prudent individual
except the cyclone-collar. I hope no Grinnell liian

FORGETTING SOMETHING
(From the Oberlin Rexiew)

in this age of machines, motors, dyuamos, and tub
bins perhaps it is not strange that: we take for granted
many things which would seem unnatural to one far

away from the lium and buzz of the modern world,
Most of us are so absorbed m learning just what button
to push and which do-hickey to step on that we eom»
pletely forget some of the fundamental truths of Nature.

Who is there that would think of questioning the
idea of having such ordinary things as “laws," telling
us what move to make next? Then, too, does anyone
ever wonder why each individual has a certain amount.
of “property” that is his own, and this IS not. to be shared
by anyone else?

in the Middle Ages, the Christians gave an explauar
tied to many of our customs. Thcy recalled Seneec's
portrayal of a world of inuocenee in which no laws were
necessary, and then went on to say that all our laws
were put upon us because of our inherent evil. The gave
this same reason for the fact that property must be
private. if we were able to hve in peace, then we should
share all property and should need no regulations.

if one person were poor, in the Middle Ages, it was
considered the duty of all who had a supersbundunce of
property to come to his aid. After all, land could belong
to no earthly person, and there was no reason why some

should receive all the benefits. The most that. could he
allowed anyone was the use of property. Hence rt was

that almsgiving was considered justice rather than
charity.

But how men believe that. they can own the earth
just by holding in their hands enough paper that we call
"money." We wonder who eonld have intended that cerr
tain members of the human race should have the best
part of this earth, and that they should have no obliga-
tions to share any of it with others.

What should we do about it? Oh, nothing. Our com-
plex civilization has got us into tbs mess, and we can
never pull ourselves out of i

AFTER COLLEGEiWHAT'J
From the Marquette Tribune)

There can be little doubt that students graduating
this year are facing a cl‘isisinot merely a period of
economic dislocation and social dishevelment, but a crisis
even in modern thought and moral code. Earthquakes
and thunderihgs of potential disasters are everywhere
rumbling, And people who get muchly excited about such
things are pretty generally agreed that the dikes of our
civilization have sprung a, few leaks and that. there aren't
enough Hanses about to plug up the holes with their
fingers.

At any rate, although ”something should be done"
and although nothing is being done, all of us are happily
acknowledging that we should meet it as optimistically,
as forthrightly, and as preparedly as possible. Ami as
suming that. our present idea. of culture is correct, there
seems little reason to disbelieve that large endeavors
should be made to develop it to its zenith. Moreover.
although socialization and the palpable efforts at it are
vastly admirable ,far greater concern should be man:
fested over society's individuals. 1f culture is to be mai -
tziued socially, it must be maintained individually.

Unfortunately, statistics and pedantic gentlemen
have been plagueing it upon the public consciousness that
after graduation, intellectual and cultural pursuit morti.
fyingly and distinctly diminishes, The reason, obviously,
lies in the graduates inevitable invoivment in the mael-
strom of business and practicality. Thus he loses the
contact with culture that he had during university days,
however vaguely and however under scholastic com-
pulsion.

That something that “should be done" to aid the
present frazzled condition out to be the continuation of
the cultural and intellectual after college graduation.
Trite and obvious and tnutological as it is. stagnation
gets nowhere.

Perhaps, through some miraculous upheaval or the
pounding of some helpfully subversive writers, we may
some day accidentally arrive at that blissful stage when
we l'ecoglize that society does depend upon its individ<
usls. In that distant day, civilization will have reached
a far more satisfactory end, with the holes in the dikes
fewer and fewer.

A CHALLENGE TO THE NATION
(From the Daily Trojan)

The graduate of 1932 probably faces a more difficult
problem than has been confronted by any group since
the first little red school house released its first product
into the hands of the cruel world. Throughout the coun-
try thousands of seniors, both in high school and in the
university today are pondering the almighty question of
whether they shall be gainfully employed when they leave
the alma meter to seek their living by their own hands.
it is a condition that is not entirely new, for graduates
of the past several years have found increasing difficulty
1!} securing employment on their departure from school.

The following is a portion of a letter received by a
Daily Trojan editor from a friend in the Middle West:
the writer was graduated from high school two years
ago this June, and is a talented violinist and singer. it
is his letter, however, that is interesting for the fact
that it expresses the chagrin and yet the hope of uheur
ployed young America:

"Once again the time has come when 1 think our
weather equals yours for comfort. I've been swimming
once, and 1 anticipate keeping it up for the next four
months. The_way things look now/7X won't have anything
else to do. It's the same old blues song, “I haven't any
job.” I have quit fussing about it thonghtibecause it's
entirely futile, The fact that i'm not alone in my pre-
dicoment makes things no easier, but it can ees me
that I'm not entirely at fault. This joblessness has
more than one evil attached to u: Lack of money, not
to mention the rut one is apt to fall into, with no im-
mediate work to eenter one's energies ou. You suggested
music as a possible lane out of my difficulties. Music
no longer offers such an inviting- field, even if we were
to suppose I possessed more than ordinary capabilities
along that line. i've studied music—violin and voice for
quite a while. or course i shall never regret the time
1 spent on acquiring a knowledge of musical art, but as
far as making it my life work or oven to earn a living7
I‘m afraid s not so good, st. Faul and Minneapolis have
hordes of musicians that are glad of the chance to eke
out. a bare existence with their talent and those two
eitues are fairly representative, I think, of the whole
situation elsewhere.”

Maybe this will serve as an open letter to the Con»
gross of the United states, or to the economis and
financiers in whose hands the country‘s future how hes,
or hangs. when approximately 11,000,000 men are out
of work In the United states as is the case now, it is
time to forget party issues, personal gain or returns on
giltreﬂge bonds, and consider the welfare of the nation's
working class. Unemployment, some people say. is with
us all the time, because of replacement of men by mar
chines, but why not, we reply, pass on the benefits of
increasing machine production to the laborer in the form
of shorter hours and higher wages. This we believe is a.
more fundamental solution of the present problem than
thawing of frozen assets.
