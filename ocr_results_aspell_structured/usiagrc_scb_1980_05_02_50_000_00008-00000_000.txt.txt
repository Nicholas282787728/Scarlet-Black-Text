ago, the Grinnell Rugby Football Club
(G.R.F.C.) Griffins will be competing
in the All lowa Rugby Tournament

nament in which 32 teams are pars
ticipating, 20 in the “B" division in
which the Griffins compete.

The Grifﬁns, who changed their
name from the Grunts earlier this
year, boast a squad of 20 members
and a record of 472 In Iowa and +4 in
International play. The 20 member
Squad includes the following seniors:
4-year captain Doug Brower, Tom
Hawbaker, Harvey Left, and Paul Sut-
ton,
the Grifﬁns became the third team
ever to tour Canada, playing 2 games
in 3 days, Losing both games to
Toronto-area clubs. St. Thomas said
“It was very excellent Rugby. We
didn't take a strong team up there,
but I saw lots of good individual and
team perlormances."

“The Canadian teams were very im-
pressed with our knowledge or the
game,” St. Thomas commented. “They
were happy that we came and they
will come down and play us here next
spring.”

St. Thomas. who has been playing
Rugby since he was a, has been in
volved wiui Rugby at Grinnell since it
