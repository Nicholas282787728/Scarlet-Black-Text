BY AMANDA BAYLISS

How prepared do the cross country runners feel

“I think we’re more ready to shock this year rhan
we‘ve ever been ready to shock before,” said runner
Mike van Hulle '07, Van Hulle strongly urged the stu—
dent body to attend the meet. “Come to The Duke
or we're going to Duke on you," he
warned.

on Saturday, Grinnell's cross

competition is expected to include
Coe, Cornell College, William
Penn, Central, Glenview, Mt. St.

and Northern Iowa Community
College.

Led by coach Will Freeman, the men's team won
last years Les Dukes meet with Adam Booth ‘04 leads
ing the team as the meet’s individual champion.This
year they expect to face some tough competition from
nationally ranked schools.

“We expect UW Stevens Point to be the big com-
petition for us," Freeman said. "They are ranked seVs
enth this week nationally and were the national runs
ners up last year,”

However, the team expects good performances
from lead runners Dave Honig ’06 and Justin Riley
’06.0ther supporting runners include Mitch Herz‘OS,
Omondi Kashidi ‘05, Colin Tschida ’05, Pete Cueno

ing champion, Gustavus Adolphus

“Taking last years returning runners and adding
the talented first-years, we make a
competitive team that will turn out
a good race and hopefully a win,"
said Katrina McGtanahan ’07.
"Winning will make the cocktail
party even better. However we per—
form we’ll be happy to celebrate"

Both teams have had strong
first meets, The men’s team began
the season with a strong ﬁrst meet
on Sept. 4 at the University ofKam
sas’Bob Timmons InvitationalThe
team placcd fourth overall against nationally ranked
Division I teams, with Riley placing eighth.

“I am really happy for Justin," said Freeman. “He
ran a very good race here in his hometown."

Pioneers snap seven—game skid
with two straight victories

3v KEVIN BVRNE

It may have taken head coach Tom sonnichsen
and his volleyball squad over a week to put one up on
the board, but the first one seems to have been a step—
ping stonc for the Pioneers.

“The ﬁrst third of the season schedule has been
as tough as any volleyball schedule we've every played
at Grinnell college," said Sonnlchscn. “our starting
line up is usually two seniors, three sophomores and
a ﬁrstvyear. So, being relatively young and playing a
tough schedule has resulted in a 177 [and now 277]
record. We are, however, playing a little better each
time out and I feel that once this group gets the ‘feels
ing‘ for winning things will improve.”

The Pioneers started the year off with seven
straight losses, including six straight road games after
losing the season opener at their home court this year,
the Grinnell High School Gymnasium. Grinnell was
ﬁnally able to break through against Augustana Cole
lege on Sept. 11
at the Knox
CollegeTourna-
ment in Gales-
burg, Ill. The
Pioneers won
30716, 26730,
30716, 30732,
1579 as Tamrah
Collins ‘07 led
her team with
17 kills and a
.548 hitting percentage. Senior captain Lara Jansen
also racked up 50 assists during the victory.

Collins chalked up the losing streak to a tough
schedule, which featured two of the top 21 teams in
Division III, and the team not playing up to its full
potential.

"I think it is a combination of the two [problems],”
she said, “We have been playing really tough compctle
tion in hopes to be better prepared for the league
matches and playoffs. I don’t think the lack of abil-
ity is the problem. This year, every single individual
can make a major contribution to the team. I believe
that if we play together, we are capable of beating any
team. So far, we have not been playing up to our true
ability."

It took Grinnell eight games to notch their ﬁrst
victory, but only one to notch their second. The
Pioneers returned home on Tuesday and edged Mt.
Mercy at Grinnell High School by a count of24-30,
27-30, 30-28, 30-25, 15-12. Leslie Turner ‘07 led the
way {or Grinnell with 25 kills and 15 digs. Collins
chipped in 12 kills and 14 digs, and Jonson posted 46
assists to go with her 13 digs.

The Pioneers know they must learn from their
mistakes and build on victories in order to suc-
ceed in Midwest Conference play this season. With
25 matches still to play, including three important
matches at the Tulsa Invitational Tournament begin—
ning on Friday, Grinnell is still in it. It starts with this
weekend, where the marquee match up will pit so“,
niehsen against his son Matt, the head coach of the
Tulsa volleyball (com. The players know that a victory
is important for many reasons.

“We need to be able to finish matches," said Cole
lins. “We had games where we had the lead and let
the other team came back. All we need to do to be
successful for the rest of the season is play our game,
learn from good competition and finish strong in cw
cry match."

“I believe that if we
play together, we are
capable of beating any
team. So far, we have
not been playing up to
our true ability."
