What Are We Doing Here

There are not 1100 students on this campus.

But, considering students as people enrolled in this col-
lege for the purpose of acquiring among other things a cer—
tain amount of academic knowledge and philosophic ideas,
there is a surprisingly great number of Students. These
people are endeavoring' with sincere effort to make their
class and study time worthwhile

At a school such as Grinnell, where studying has been
as much or more a tradition than partying, students ex-
pect teaching methods consistent with their intent. They
expect teachers to be opensminded enough to look to their
own methods upon occasion. They know that even the best
of teachers will not rest on his laurels and lose sight of the
true objectives of the profession to impart knowledge, the
desire for it, and skills to acquire it.

We as students, they as faculty, might do well to look at
some of the present teaching practices at G nell,to de-
termine their worth, At this mid-semestei'point we might
all question the purposes and values of the things we are
doing, not in a general way, But, on specific practices.

For instance, are tests doing us the most good they
can? Are we getting them back soon enough to make
them he the teaching tool as well as the checking tool they

are intended to be? I

Are we acting old enough and sincerely interested
enough in our courses to scare out the hugaboo of drop
quizzes? And are those drop quizzes being used With dis-
cretion’.’ It’s time for faculty and students alike to look
for the purpose of these devices instead of blindly regard—

ing them as a time-honored fetish. Is it necessary to scare.

students into doing routine assignments? If drop quizzes
are used as a checking- device, should they count as grades?
‘7 '7

How much of a class response is a reflection of its
teacher? Is a monotone or a large party from the night lie—
fore responsible for dozing students? IS lack of adequate
preparation a reflection of careless students .or unstimu-
later] students? Is a low class arerng'e a reflection of poor
work or unreasonable standards?

These are questions which we cannot pretend to be
able to answer. The psychologists in the college can’t answer
them. The administration doesn’t know the answer. But
the questions are uppermost in the minds of many students
who are concerned about doing a good Jobl Let us hope
the same questions will be considered with the same ser—
iousness by those whose help we seek.

“This is a good, informal way

OLD CUSTOMERS and NEW.

When asked for a statement
for the press, the immediate
reply of the new student roun—
cil president was ”I'm glad it‘s
over," Then in a more serious
vein he added, ”I’d like to thank
all the students for their in‘
terest in the election and for
the support they have given me.
In the same breath, however,
I ask for the continued interest
and support of the Student Coulis
oil from the students." He also
expressed the hope that students
will give careful consideration
to the election of student counr
cil representatives in house
meetings Monday night.

Relatively Short Convention

The nominating convention
was relatively short. Taylor
and Blough were nominated on
the second (first unlnstructed)
ballot.

Toward the, end of the second
halloi when It was apparent that
Taylor and Blough both had re»
celved the necessary votes for
nomination, the Clark and Smith
delegations injected a bit of
horseplay into convention pro-
ceedlngs. Instead of voting for
one of the two nominees, the
Clark delegation supported one
of the local shop keepers.

The Smith delegation,
had already created a mild sen-
sation at the beginning of the
convention by marching in
through the front after all the
delegations were seated, wear—
ing red sh‘ ts and puiting cigars,
