The game of the week had to be
the contest between the Sea Men
and the Nads. The grudge began
when the Sea Men knocked off the
Nads earlier in the year, thus rob»

tion. But, that was not to be the
case this go—round; the Nads

The Women's Soccer club wdl
be hosting its first indoor tourna-
ment, The Grinnell invitational.

South gymnasiums of the P,E.C.
Games will be played in the north

The Club sent two teams to
Cedar Falls last weekend to par
ticipate in the UNI indoor tourna-
ment, in their first appearance of
the semester. both teams played
three games and both squads
showed great enthusiasm despite
very trustrating ties and losses.

The trip to UNI was an introduc-
tion to the game situation and Con-
sidering the short amount of
preparation. playercoach
Louellen steadman felt that die
experience was well worth the
trip.

Besides introducing the newer
players to the league, it provided
the more experienced players an
opportunity to sharpen their skills
for the outdoor season.

The Women's Soccer club is cur-
rently short of equipment and
funds and would appreciate any
donations of any Size to keep them
playing for one more season.

Grinnell hosts the nation

by Robert Quashie

To commemorate the 30th ans
niversary of the breaking of the
tour-minute mile, Grinnell Col-
lege will be hosting a national
symposium on sports entitled
“Sports and the National
Character” April is. Top figures
from the U S _and Great Britian
will gather on the campus to
discuss such topics as “Politiciz-
ing Sports: Who, when. Why";
“The Olympics: Myth and Reali-
ty"; and “Amateur and ProfesV
sional: Distinction without a Dilr
ference."

Along with the panel discus»
sions. Grinnelllans will be treated
to the films, “The Breaking of the
FourMinute Mile" and “Chariots
of Fire” and a track meet which
boasts a field of at least 20 teams,
including the Ambassador Track
club of Nassau, The Banamas

The keynote speaker of die
event will be none other than
noger Bannister. the man who
was the first to break the four-
minute barrier. Also on hand will
be_ Chris Chataway and Chris
Brasher, Bannister's teammates
at Oxford University.

Bob Martin, presidentof the Na-
tional Association of Sportcasters
and Sportswriters will moderate
the weekend. The panels will in
clude, former football great Alan
Page; swimmer, president of the
Women’s Sports Foundation and
commentator at the Winter Olymr
pics, Donna dc Varona; John
Underwood, senior writer for
Sports lllustrated; Olympic track
star Billy Mills. whose career is
the subject of the current film
“Running Brave”,

Also present will be Chris
Grant. director of women’s
athletics at iowa University
sociologist Harry Edwards and
Former Iowa Football coach Fora
rest Evashevski,

The chairperson of the sym-
posium will be George Drake m
track star. Rhodes Scholar. coir
lege president. Drake hopes the
symposium will help spur and
focus national attention on some
of the critical issues facing
athletics in general and the wellr
being of athletes ln Dartlcular,

The idea of a symposium came
to Drake 10 years ago but his ex-
cltement about the fourrminute

mile has its was in his days as a
student. An athlete himself. he
was caught up in the stir caused
by the Bannister achievement and
while passing through the area, he
had the opportunity to train on the
track at Oxford and to meet
Brasher and Chataway, “Both
men.” Drake comments. "were
very interesting away from
sports."

Drake was intrigued by the
Britlsh attitude that, in competi»
tion. the best man would win so
they never took their training too
seriously. Bannister commented
in his own book that if he could not
break the record by training only
one hour each day, then he would
not break the record,

Drake mentions that he thinks
some British athletes of the past
took this concept to an extreme
but that the saw a great value in
their ideals, The symposium will
serve as a Chance for some of the
more outstanding individuals in
British and American sports to
share their ideals and for the cums
munity 0f Grinnell and the nation
at large, to hear a little intelligent
exchange on the matter of sports
and national character.
