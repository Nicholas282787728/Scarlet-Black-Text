Glomset Warns
Against Dieting
in Chapel Talk

 

“Dieting is vicious unless carried
on under tiic care of a physicianxq
declared Dr, Daniel J. Glomsct of Des,
Moines in commenting on food fods'
duriug an address on “Simple Rules:
of Health' in chapel Friday morning.

Moderation in eating, drinking l
smoking, and exercise were advocatv
cd by Dr. Glomset as fundamentali
principles in the keeping of good]
health, An annual physical examine-3
tion, anti sleeping between seven and
ten hours a day were also included
in the health program. “You Can't
sleep too much," he asserted.

“The best I can say for smoking,
is that it is a filthy habitil know
because I smoke myself, Dr. Glorn—
set continued. '

Although he admitted that no one
knows just how much is the proper
amount of exercise, Dr, Clomsct Illri
sisted that “Some of the wildly com-i
petitive sports in college are not com
ducivc to super-health."

Dilute alcohol in small quantities
is a food, but it becomes a poison,
in amounts over three ounces, Dr.
Glcmset said in advising against the
drinking of alcohol. H. W, Matlack,
organist, played a few bars of “Drink
to Me Only With Thine Eyes," fol-
lowing the prayer.

at a meeting yesterday of men inter‘
l

csted in the sport.
No schedule has been arranged. for

the Pioneer team, but it is pi-obeblel

that dual rnccts will be held with
Iowa State college and Drake uni-
versity, and Grinnell will probably
enter the quadrangular mcct held
annually at the University of Iowa.
Butler Relays

It is also possible that the local
squad will mcct Armour Tech of
Chicago, and enter the Butler relays
soinetrine during the second selneSr
tor, according to thc athletic depart-
ment,

Even with 10 track lcttcrmcn hack
in school this year, Grinnell will
probably not have an exceptionally
strong all around team, but should
have some good individual perform-
ers. Those who hovc won lctters
in the sport previously are Joc Plieif—
for Art McIlrath and Tom Gordon,

distance men; Harold Ander-on and.

Joe McKlveell, qllal‘tcr-milers', Al
Rose and Bob Morgan, shot-put; Ar-
iiold Dickinson, high mp, Dick

Wesley Clark, liurdler,
Basketball Claims» Two
Morgan and Mason, bcing on the

‘basketball squad, will not be able to

take part in the indoor track come
petition. Thcre are several other men
who have showed promise in various
events and should find a place on thc
squad. Gordon Meeter was depend.
able as a shotputtei- last year; Don
Bentley and Don Barnes arc quarter»
milers who looked good on the fresh-
man squad last spring; Floyd Here
ton and Don Arnold are both working
on the half-mile; whilc Bob Bair,
Bill Canright, and Jack Halsey were
prominent in crossscountry running
this fall.

“There are a lot of openings left
by the good men wc' lost," explained
Duke. “The fellows who showed up
well in the intramural track meet
last year should all turn out." The
team will probably be weak in thc
sprints, hurdles, and pole vault, ac—
cording to the present outlook, but
prospects are quite promising for
good mile and four—mile relay teams.
