conference championship

BYJIU GARG

After ﬁnishing 16-9 and going 4-0 in divi-
sional play, the men's tennis team will venture to
Madison,Wis.diisweekend to cryto capture their
sixth consecutive confernice championship.

“It will all depend on how well we play,” said
number one ranked singles player juan Carlos
Perez '11.“l.fwe are focused and we bring our best,
it should not he an issue to win conference.”

To prepare for the postseason, the team has
faced quality oornpetition all year including a
match last Saturday against die ninth-ranked
team in the region, Luther College. In the matdi,
which took place in Rochester, Minn., Grinncll
fell to Luther in a 5-4 decisionThc Pioneers were
able to capture points from the top three singles
positions as well as number one doubles.

“We are a young team and we are very good
at the bottom,we happened to lose to Luther but
those guys are seemingly learn how to phy better,"
said Carcaptain and number one doubles player
Dan LaFounta‘me '09. “It won’t hurt us at confet—
ence championship, in ﬂict,I expect those guys to
carry the team."

Earlier in the year, the team beat the two other
top teams in conferenchSr. Norbert College
and Lawrence University to the tune of 970, 9701f
the Pioneers are able to capture another champie
onship, they will become only the second team in

the Midwest Conference to do so. Ripon College
ripped oﬂ’ eight consecutive championship wins
from 1985-1992

With the team at full health going into con-
ference and the clear favorites due to their con-
ference play, the Pioneers could make a return to
the NCAA regionals, where the team lost 5-1 to
Washington University last season.

“Last year we underperformed to some de-
gree, but we ended up putting up an amazing end
of the season run,” LaFountaine said.

This year, are team has played much of their
non-conference schedule against regionally
ranked teams, including nationally ranked No.2
Washington University, whom they lost to 8—1
earlier in the season.

“I pitched a pretty diﬁicult schedule at the
team," Coach Andy Hamilton said. “But what
we’ve seen is the younger players have beneﬁted by
the diﬁicult schedule and the veteran players have
really stepped up."

' e the team is very young, the men have
been getting better throughout the season and are
prepared for the upcoming postseason

“I think our team is very deep, we have three
freshmen playing in our lineup right now," Perez
said, “With time they are going to develop their
game like I did last year."

The wind has been blowing favorably for Pioneers on the
baseball diamond—so favorably it pushed {our balls out of
the park in their game against Illinois College last Saturday.

“There were really fortunate hitting conditions," said
Mike Nodzensk‘i ’12, who hit three homernns against the
Blueboys in Jacksonville, Ill. “The wind was blowing out and
[Illinois College] was a little short on pitching sowe were able
to take advantage oithat and put up some good numbers.”

In addition to Nodzenski’s three home runs, Mark Wile
cox '09 knocked out one home run, while the Pioneers had
a total of 20 hits for the game, toppling the Blueboys 18*
9. The Pioneers (2079) attribute their success to increased
practice in situational hitting.

"Especially in the close games, situational hitting has
been the reason why we've pulled offthe \vin,”Ben Mendoza V
'09 said. “Situational hitting being like getting our hunts
down. getting the big two out RBI hit. scoring a run that
needs to be scored in like the 8th inningiwhich is huge,
which is what happened,[against Simpson]."

1n Tuesday's game, facing nonrconfercnce opponent
Simpson College, the Pioneers traded runs with the Storm
for much of the game. But tied 575 in the eighth and two
runners on, the Pioneers bats came through again, JP
Prouty ’10 managed to score the winning run off ofa clutch
sacriﬁce ﬂy by Nodzenski.

“It doesn't matter irwc go into the ninth with a one run
lead," said Mendoza. "Ben Pop: ['12] is our closer, so we
know that he'll get the job done." .

The win over Simpson was the 20th of the season for
Grinnell, a school record. In addition to their hitting, the
Pioneers have also been able to rely on their solid pitching
staff all season.

“Our pitching staff is so deep that it's really hard as a
pitching staff to lose a game," Marshall Chavez '10 said. “I
don't think we’ve really lost a game by more than rwo runs
this season. Our staffis pretty top notch."

With consistent strength on the mound and growing
power behind the plate, the Pioneers are in good standing for
their final regular season games this weekend. They travel to
Monmouth on Saturday and host the Fighting Scots on Sun-
day to determine the Midwest Conference South Division
Champion and a chance at the MWC tournament May 8.

“This weekend Wlll be huge because we’re tied for first
place with Monmouth right now," Mendoza said. “The goal
is to go to conference up north and win conference which
will take at least two wins this weekend."

Though the Pioneers hope to come back victors, they’re
trying to take the rest ofthe scasonjust one game at a time.

“We’re trying not to get ahead of ourselves and not look
ahead ofthat Monmouth series,"Nodzenski said.“You know,
the arch rival with the conference championship on the line.
We're looking to take at least three out of four games this
weekend and then just go from there."
