America is a country put together in a
rather briei period oi time irom many dii-
ferent immigrant groups. The American
Indians were the first to come. but their
immigration was spread out over tens of
thousands of years,

It now seems reasonable that some early
Chinese and Japanese explorers arrived
on the west coast of our continent before
the birth of Christ, and that Greek, Phoenir
cian. and perhaps Hebrew explorers and
settlers also reached North America
beio're the beginning‘oi the present Comr
mun Era. Irish, Scandinavian, English,
French, and Spanish folk also visited and
settled, at least for a time, on the North
American mainland before the coming of
Columbus

In the years of early exploration, settlers
came from the British Isles. France.
Sweden, Holland, Spain, Germany,
Switzerland, italy and virtually every
other country in Europe. So by the time oi
the American revolution. the melting pot
had already been bubbling ior several cen-
turies.

> Indeed, one of the great concerns of the
founding fathers was how to cope with the
ianiastic pluralism oi their country in
which, the constitution and the laws were
iundamentally English but only about one-
half of the inhabitants were of English
background.

Faced with a diversity oi language,
religion, culture. and political belief, the
founders of the country made two deck
sions that were to have immense conse
quences.

First, by definition. the society was to be
a coalition 7 building society. The tenth
and fiftyrfirst federalist Papers make it
clear that no group in American Society
would ever be able' to govern without
building coalitions with other groups.

Secondly, the early naturalization laws
resolved the question of what it takes to be
an American. Just as the Constitution
made a virtue out oi necessity by turning
the deiacto pluralism oi the society into a
theoretical coalition-building system, so
the def‘acto diversity oi Americans was
turned into a virtue by the fact that all that
was required to become an American was
to be a citizen — in the traditional
eighteenth-century French definition of
”citoyen” a one who supported the
political and social principles oi the coun-
try‘s government.

To be an American, all you had to do was
promise your allegiance to the political
principles contained in the Constitution
and the Declaration of independence,
Nothing else was imposed. You did not
have to give up your religion, your culture,
your personal belieis. your National
background or even your language. You
o.dn'i even have to speak English to
become an American citizen until the
twentieth century,

No other nation in the world has been so
generous with its citizenship; indeed,
many of the social democracies in Western
Europe will not permit their migrant
laborers to become citizens, while in the
United States immigrant laborers have

always been urged too become fulletledged
American citizens.

Those who founded the country and their
descendants became ill at ease With the
great wave of immigration that hit the
country’s shores in the nineteenth century.
They began to fear these “wretched refuse
of the earth.H as they were described on
the statue or Liberty. They were
“foreign". often illiterate. diseased. dirty,
sometimes radical. and certainly
undesirable.

Yet, those who were here before the rest
were true to their principles. They let them
in. they let them become Americans, they
let them vote, and while they didn’t do
them any iavors, they at least let them
save some of the fruit of their labors so
that they to. could begin to share the comr
forts and affluence of the American socie~
lyv

The immigrants found that the society to
which they came was already pluralistic.
You had to be something Episcopalean,
Presbyterian, Methodist, Scotchrirish,
Scandinavian, Jewish,_English,

Ethnic identification was not so much a
way oi reierring back to the Old Country
as it was a way oicarving ata piece ooi the
American turi ior yourseli, your iriends,
and your relations,

The hyphen in the hyphenate-American
was an equality sign;,it was a way of
becoming American. The ethnic groups

came into existence for both economic and
political power. ior personal seli-deimition
and social location in the New World

The success oi the immigrant groups has
been fantastic despite their success these
groups have not given up their culture,
customs, and beliefs. They discovered that
they could be good Americans and still
maintain some of their own heritage,
although, of course. there was no obliga-
tion to be “ethnic” if one did not choose to
be.

There have been terrible injustices in
the American past. Blacks and the
American Indian were excluded from the
beginning, and their struggle for full rights
has been a difficult one.

Asian Americans as well as Hispanic
Americans have also been the object of bit-
ter discrimination. and many Catholic and
Jewish immigrants have suffered from
prejudice, ‘

Nonetheless, ior a relatively new nation.
spread across a large continent, the
pluralistic American experiment combin-
ing unity with diversity and a comommon
culture with ethnic variety has been one of
the most phenomenal successes in human
political and social history,

Tucked away in Burling Library 5 base-
ment is a relatively new and exciting
resource for those who appreciate art, The
Print and Drawing Study open Room has
been open for two years. but has only housr
ed travelling and loaned exhibitions for
one year.

“It has taken a little while for people to
discover us," said Kay Wilson. supervisor
of the print room. “Not only do we have ex-
hibitions. but the College’s permanent art
collection is also kept here.” Wilson said
that original works oi art on paper, in-
cluding prints by Picasso, Leutrec. Rem-
hrandt and Millet are available for the
campus community to view "It is an in
valuable resource for any art student,"
she added

One exhibit in the Print and Drawing
Room until Sept 29 is “Edgar Chahine:
LaVie Parisiennc ” This collection of over
60 prints and etchings depict liie in Paris
at the turn of the century. They are provid-
ed by the Smithsonian Institution Travell-
ing Exhibition Service (SITES).

Born in Armenia, Chahine (187449477
spent much of his artistic life in Paris, He
used members oi Paris society as sub
)ects. but initially the Leutrec-influenced
artist Considered himself a “student of the
streets" and iocused on the City's poor and
downtrodden. His portraits oi beggars.
i'agplckers and the unemployed hang next
to portraits of dignified and beautiful
women, Des Moines Register art critic
Eliot Nusbaum said “his etchings have the
quality of paintings , . . and capture
something as ephemeral as the spirit oi a
timC .”

in addition to the Chahinc prints Wilson
said this year exhibits of 19th century
European impressions; Baltic Graphic
Art; the works or Contemporary Soviet Ar»
tist Alexander Kalugin; and a
photography exhibit irom the Hallmark
