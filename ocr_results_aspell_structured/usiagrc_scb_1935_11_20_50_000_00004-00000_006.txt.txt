Old Territmial Building (1840)

HE vogue for Greek architectinal forms came in the
period when Cities were named Athens, Corinth.
Spam, Troy, and Ypsilanti. urly in the 18005. Both
fads lingered long after, but most of the early. enthu'
siastioally Greek college buildings have been eithei
destroyed or "corrected“ hy more academic and
sophisticated generations.
, The Greek Revival in
.3! architecture followed the
u . . .
pubhmtxon or dravvings of
. Greek temples, just as the
' v earlier Roman revival of
.Jelrersqn and his circle had
’1 resulted from the study of
Roman structures, Both re'
vivals ﬂourished on both
, sides of the Atlantic.
. i, .-. Manning Hall at Brown
«ﬂm University is the exact copy
. of a Doric temple to Diana
Mammg Ha" in Eleuais, exactly twice as
big as its model. Guard College in Philadelphia. pier
tured in every architectural textbook, also thoroughly
Greek, is still the largest Corinthian temple in the
world.

BUT the pure temple form was soon abandoned by
American builders. Greek tanples had no need
for windows nor for usable interior arrangements
Their shoerbox shape was almost impossible to man»
age, so he as daylight and convenience were con»
cerned. In short. the tem 1e form was impractical {or
modern conditions a hun years ago,

So a compromise was reached. The potent old
Colonial tradition of borlike halls was Greekiﬁtd by
the addition of a templedike portioo or frontispiwe.
The portieo could proyeet timidly or boldly and still
“suggest“ the temple front.

This solution. modiﬁed colonial cupola and all,
soon found its way to Iowa. The old Territorial Build,
ing, built for the legislature in i84o. passed mm the
hands of the University of Iowa soon after.

The University of Delaware's ﬁrst building, line
ished in 1834. adheres to the southern traditions of
warm red brick, an imposing enmnce'stzirway, and
somewhat heavier (more Roman!) proportions. But
eloquent or GreroRonian fashion is the digniﬁed
triad of Doric porches.
