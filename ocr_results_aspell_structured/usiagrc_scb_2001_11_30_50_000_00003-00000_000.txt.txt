None of the student initiatives passed this time
around, but even if they had, what difference would it

have made anyway?

In the student initiative elections last
week, all proposed inirinrivcs toiled beans:
of low voter turnout,

Initiatives included proposals tharsru.

ing hall food: be available to students, that
a bordcllo be constructed on umpus, and

Boise Cascade.

In order for an initiative so pass, as leasr
halfofthe students on campus rnuss vote
on the initiative and two-thirds of those
votes must be in favor. The most votes ast
on any iniriarive this year was 573. There
are 1287 degree-mtning students on mine
pus this semester.

“By nos turning out to vore, students
undermine their own powcs as snidenrs,"
Noe Monte: ‘03. SGA student services co-
ordinator, said. “There are a lot of good is-
sues brought forth."

Wldi the exception ofthe initiative all-
ing for the conssrnesion oia bordello, more
than two-thirds of the votes actually mst
on every initiative were positive.

The SGA website says that student inla
risrives "are a way for the student body to
voice their opinions on issues iniportans to
them."

“Its student a ssudenr inirinrive passes,

This initiative called for Grinnell to hire a fullalime
counselor who "specializes in meeting the needs of
a diverse student population.” Those backing it felt
that RLCs were overburdened and some students
were uncomfortable leaving campus to go to the
Mental Health Center.

Students felt that eight computers in Burling was
an insufﬁcient number. They noted that it forced
students to checkout many books and Xerox too
many materials. More computers might allow more
students access to materials, since they would not
necessarily leave the library.

WHAT NAPPUIED?

Grinnell does not have a full-time counselor, but
the number of visits to the Mental Health Center
allotted to each student has been increased,

Wlm NAPPENED?
There are now way more than eight computers in
Hurling.

Establish ExCo

Students called for the establishment or an
experimental college modeled after that at Oberlin.
This college would allow students, faculty members,
and community members to organize and instruct
courses that might not be offered otherwise. The
initiative suggested that up to two credits be
awarded to instructors and participants.

Students believed that the college mascot—the
pioneer—should be changed because pioneers are
associated with “conquering," ethnocide, and
genocide.

WHAT uarrtutn?
The mascot is still officially the pioneer, but many
sports teams have chosen unofﬁcial mascots, such

as the swim teams’ Mad Dogs and Mad Ducks.
WHAT nilwtlltn?

In January oi 1997, ExCo was established. This was
not the first experimental college Grinnell had had,
however. ExCo operated much as the initiative
proposed but without any credit being awarded.

liatives from the past work?

HIV testing on campus

Students called for the college to ”provide access to
free, conﬁdential and anonymous HIV testing,
either on campus or in town," because the nearest
plates to get tested at the time were Des Moines
and Iowa City (one had to devote approximately
eight hours to driving, testing, and follow-up).
