 

Think about
. cabinet’s
proposals

The trustees will be on campus tomorrow and Sunday for
one of their three yearly board meetings. They will un-
doubtedly be interested to see how last semester's
reorganization and White Paper discussions have affected
events and attitudes on campus this semester. Reports will
be made to them about where things stand and about
suggestions for future improvement of the college

Along with President Turner, Deans Walker and
Eysenbach, administrative. faculty and student groups will
be meeting with the board. Ruth Montgomery, Bob Handler
and Gary Doernhoefer, SGA president, vice-president and
assistant student coordinator, respectively, will give a
presentation to the trustees Saturday morning. Sunday
morning, the Residence Hall Improvements Committee will
meet with the trustee Committee on Student Life.

The SGA cabinet has identified six specific issues that

they think need to be addressed in the future and that they
will present to the trustees. At the Wednesday night Joint

Board meeting Montgomery presented their ideas. She asked
for discussion about the cabinet's ideas and any other areas.

They will discuss with the board the necessity for an
activity fee increase to keep up with the inflationery in-
creases in. entertainment and other areas. Montgomery
explained that they will not be asking the board for an in-
crease for next year, but rather alerting them to the fact that
an increase will be needed soonr

Handler plans to review for the board where the
cabinet believes things stand following the reorganization.
Progress of the Student Input Committee will be reported,

Annexpanded, ,program of..internships and practicum
credits will be recommended to the trustees

Montgomery also plans to report on the progress of the
committee examining the college's affirmative action policy.
The cabinet members plan to express particular concern
about the low number of black faculty members.

They plan to report that the faculty advising systemvneeds
to be improved. Montgomery said they will report that the
RA system is a positive facet of the college’s counseling
program, though it serves only a minority of students.

Finally, they plan to propose improvements for Hurling
Library. Sound, shelf and study space, and lack of heat are
problems that they think should be addressed. Carpeting
was discussed at the Wednesday night Joint Board meeting
as,a particular area of concern. A resolution was passed
strongly recommending that the trustees take steps towards
the installation of carpet in the library,

It seems surprising that carpeting was the only issue that
was discussed at any length at the Joint Board meeting No
hall rep asked where the cabinet believed things stood as a
result of the reorganization, No one expressed support for an
affirmative action report and no discussion took place about
needed improvements in the college counseling system. No
one suggested other areas that needed to be discussed.

It would seem that each Joint Board member would have
more interest in and opinion about areas for improvement
within the college, particularly those identified by the
cabinet.

Cabinet members have been talking to people all week and
compiling ideas. Thus it seems that they will be able to make
a responsible presentation to the trustees tomorrow.

However, if anyone feels strongly about one of the areas
that has been identified or about any other areas, they
should discuss their ideas with Ruth or Bob Dr Gary before
tomorrow morning.

Also, everyone can be thinking about concrete proposals
within the areas identified by the cabinet as well as about
proposals for dorm improvements, curricular changes and
other specific areas, Those really interested can even start
planning to work specific proposals out as committee
members this spring.

We urge, and the college needs, your involvement in
formulating policies and programs that will improve a

The old watering hole runs dry—almost.

Leave thermostats alone

To llic Editor: In [he four years
that I’ve been a student here I've
heard a lot of talk from the ad
ministration about energy con
servation, Yet I have not witnessed
any real commitment to that goal
on the part of the administration

For example, I live in a college-
owned house and lhose of us who
live in the house kecp the two
thermostats set at 55 degrees and
65 degrees because we lind those
settings more than adequate to
heat the house. We have to pry the
thermostats open in order to turn
them down.

The
Bob
experience

To the Editor: My Grinnell
experience began with my being
told that in order to get my full
share of the Grinnell experience I
would have to conform to some of
society’s standards that I did not
agree with.

One of these standards had to do
with the wearing of a coat in
winter. I was told by various
members of the Grinnell com
munity that if I did not wear a coal
in winterl would catch a cold, For
three years at Grinnell I seldom
worea winter coat. I never caught
a cold

This winter I decided to conform
to society's standard and now wear
a coat in winter. This past week I
have caught a cold. To the Grin~

nellians who have given the advice, .

mygonly question is this,. “Is my
cold part, of my share of 'the

Well experience?” Jeff Bnh

Christmas break, the house was
unbearably hot, Upon prying open
the thermostats, we found that
both were set above 70 degrees. We
turned the thermostats back down.

A few days later B&G had to
come intothe house to fix one at the
radiators. In the process, they
turned both thermostats back up to
70 degrees and locked them again.
We pryed them open and turned
them down again.

My point, is this. while I un-
derstand that many of the college
buildings have complicated
heating systems and their there
mostats need to be set higher in

order for certain parts to receive
any heat at all, houses have very
simple heating systems. If the
occupants of a house choose to live

in a house healed to a lowel
temperature, why should a sup-
posedly energy~conscious ad-
ministration and staff try to force
them to live in one that is “W3,
comfortably'hot?

We need to change our lifestyle. I
find it absurd that such a situation
as the one I described above could
happen in an institution that
purportedly is trying to conserve
energy. Carol Godschall

Approximately 300 Grinnell

faculty and administration
cooperation with students is the
sort of thing that Grinnell is sup
posed to be about. Sincerely, Matt
