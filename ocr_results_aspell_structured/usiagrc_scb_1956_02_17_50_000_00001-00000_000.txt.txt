LB Polls Women
On Monitor Plan
At Hall Meetings

By Mary Mills

League Board will take an
informal vote in house meet-
ings Monday to determine
if women are satisfied with
the present night monitor
system or if they prefer
another method of checking,
such as a sign-in plan.

The vote is one result of yes
terday’s meeting between the
League Board and ten women
who were elected proportionate-
ly by halls to discuss the night
monitor system with the we»
men's governing group.

Suggested at the meeting was
a plan whereby each women,
when she came in, would initial
a sheet placed by her floor
telephone. A_ list of girls who
had not signed the sheets would
then be turned into the night
girl. Proponents of the plan
claim it would place more re-
sponsibllity on the individual
women.

Need for more communica-
tion between the League Board
and the women, and proposals
ior extending underclass wo-
men's hours to 10:30 p.m. were
also discussed. It was decided
that a new group of girls will
be elected in
