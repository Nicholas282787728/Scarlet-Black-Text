THE NEW OUTLOOK

One feature which distinguishes the postwar
era frolll that which preceded is foulld ill the sig-
nificance of one word‘iuternntionulisiil. Of course
there are many new chorocteri IFS which havc
appeared in the world sillco 1918. but none which
are of such nuignitudc‘, and none which involve so
much of human happiness.

The progress of llllanllllld is shown ill the dc-
velopliicllt of outloo and view. Primitive soriet
found the family 115 s one and on], interest, which
became superseded by the tribe as time passed.
Since then has appeared the city state, the prov-
ince, and finally the nation. The units of. society
have steadily grown wider, until today men are
thinking in terms of the world of countries as coili-
prising a unit, It is not to be expected that this
new and broader concept will he established in o
few years, or cTcn decades, but people have at
last become conscious that complex civilization of
today is bearing them inevitably ill that direction.
as history proves. Men are beginning to see the
countries as comprising a collective unit. where
each nation is only a component port of o. greater
whole.

The symbol of this new era is the League of
Nations, whose main intent is well knowm—thc
maintenance of peace and prosperity in the whole
world. It must he admitted that tho Lcague is not
succeeding wonderfully at present but thot' is tllc
fault of the people, and not that of the League
It will ncvcr be able to function efficiently until
internationalism is accepted by the people as a
whole. A body whose view is international can-
not progress ill a world of people who still see only
the national, and so one should not expect too
much at present from the League where such a sit-
uation exists.

It is too bad that the majority of the people
check the very movements which they ultimately
adopt, hilt such has always been the case, and
probably always will be. As a group, mankind al—
ways checks progress.

Certainly there is nothing in the League which
is mysterious,. esoteric, and a symbol of domination.
and controls Such an opinion is the result of great
misunderstanding, for the League has a definite
task, and will have even greater problems and
capacities in the futulc The unit grows larger as

ation b miles more complex, and the com-
plexity of civ 'ition today' Is milking the world a
unit in itself.

PHYSICAL EDUCATION

The benefits of physical education are self
evident. That Grinncll has dcvclopcd a depart-
ment of physical educntion for women iii an intelli—
gent and comprehensive manner is equally cvidcnt.

Like any other human plzln, the department
has its \vcakncsscs, which, apparently insignificant,
yct mar the impression of the whole. Specifically,
tllc 1:30 5 imming class is a marked imperfection
of the physical education schedule.

Since most Griuncll women out in the quad
l'allglc, whore luilch i served at 12 :30, they can»
not have finished their meal much before 1 p.m.,
oven with the most rapid consumption of food.
This menus that women must be ill the pool only
It little more than a half hour after lunch, a coil-
dition which common sense does not advise.

The result of this schedule is that on two doys
of the week, most swimmers of tllc 1:30 class must
eat almost no lunch unless they want to endure sc-
i'cre discomfort, or tllcy must wait until after
s imming class and have lunch in some place other
than the quadrangle. Many students cannot oi-
ford lunch outside the quadrangle, even twicc it
week.

It is doubtless true that the physical education
department for women realizes the disadvantage
of the 1:30 swimming class, which may be the re-
sult of a crowded schedule. However, in the inter-
ests of health, convenience, and economy, cannot
something be done about itfl

IMPROVING THE PROFESSORS
(From the Marquette Tribune)

Many college and universrty professors have come
to a realization that all knowledge does not necessarily
pass from them to the student, but that the student may
also instruct the professor. There are just as many, if
not more, who have become narrow-minded and pedan~
tic to such a degree that they give instruction like a
machine tiirhihg out a product. And they fondly imag-
ine that this instruction is as fault-free as an article
produced by a precision machine.

It goes without saying that the narrow-minded
pcdant is in error. And it is a pity that those more
enlightened gentlemen, who are willing to learn, cannot
seem to establish contact with the student body to a
sufficient degree to accomplish any real good. Of course,
some good is accomplished through their efforts, but it.
is only a drop in the bucket.

Students usually take courses, mainly those of a
more or less specialized nature, with a definite idea in
mind of learning something practical and pertinent. Too
often, through the methods of presenting the subject,
all that is learned is theory. Theory is undoubtedly
necessary for a true appreciation and knowledge, but
theory alone is poor training.

Professors teach the matter in a certain y for a
number of years, and because they are not or zed or
advised as to possible errors in their method, come to
believe that they are being entirely successful. Quite
frequently they are not. But the fault is as much the
students' as it is theirs.

Modern youth, typified by your college man or Wo—
man, is extremely averse to exhibiting its real thoughts
and feelings, This despite the fact that they are ordin<
arily termed "frank." Their frankness is only displayed
in generalitiesinever is the true self exposed. So, whorl
the professor asks the class to make suggestions and
criticism, he is rewarded with a blank silence.

The reason is simple: Youth fears to be laughed at.

There is a solution, and an obvious one. If, after
classes have been in session for a period of about two
months, the professor Will ask the Students to Write out
what they honestly think of the course and the method
of teaching it, results will undoubtedly be obtained. For,
if the students are allowed to make their suggestions in
writing. and not sign them. they will cooperate.

Much dross will undoubtedly be contributed, and
many ideas expounded which are impractical. But if
there is only one worthwhile suggestion for every 25
poor ones, a real good will have been accomplished, and
the time will not have been wasted.

IF GANDHI GOES BACK
(horn the Daily Trojan)

Gandhi has been sorely disappointed by the atti-
tude of the British statesmen towards the Indian prob-
lem at the Round Table conference and is planning to
go back to India and launch his program of ciVll dis»
obedience for independence through passive resistence.
Gandhi has persistently pleaded with the English auth-
orities for a real “change of heart" and now finds him»
self disillusioned.

The Round Table conference was doomed to fhiiure
in as much as the British government began to adapt
its imperialistie designs and to create a division among
the delegates of the conference. Moreover, the delegates
are by no means the representatives of the people of
India. They are chosen by British administration in
Indiu and could not. but voice the plans of their masters.

It seems now that India is going to pass through
a new ordeal in the next. few years. The whole country
is going to be thrown into a turmoil and nobody can
definitely predict what will be the result of this terri-
blc struggle. So far it is sure that foreign and domestic
trade will suffer a tremendous loss and the native in-
uustrial progress will be arrested for a while. But. as
Gandhi has said: “No nation ever achieved its liberty
without making huge sacrifices,"

Who can prophecy the conditions of India after this
momentous trail of revolution and evolution? Will she
be another china. disuhited, weak, a prey to foreign
aggression, and menaced by internal upheavals and dis—
cord 7 or will she be another great republic, an honored
member of the federation of the nations of the world
contributing her share to the Sum total of the world
progress and civilization?

We will have to Wait and see while India formulates
her destiny. We still believe that an accord between
the two countries can be achieved through a peaceful
means to the great. advantage of both nations concerned.
