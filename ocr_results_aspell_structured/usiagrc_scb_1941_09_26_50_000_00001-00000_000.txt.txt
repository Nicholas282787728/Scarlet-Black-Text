On Doors?—Yes

On Trees?—No

—Says Canard

By William Buckley

Trees are not bulletin boards.

James Miles, director of the
Cadahouts, learned this,fact from
Dean of Personnel Shelton L.
Boatty, who, according to Miles.
learned it from Henry S. Canard,
professor of botany.

Milcs had posted signs on cam-
pus trees advertising the sale of
tickets to the Cadabout organizar
tion “Ring that Bell,” the signs
all ordered. Then Conard called
Beatty, telling him, in effect,
"Trees are not bulletin boards."
Beatty relayed the information to
the heating plant. The heating
plant sent a crew into action. The
signs disappeared.

According to Miles, “Only God
can make a tree."
