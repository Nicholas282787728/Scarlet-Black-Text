To Be Formed To
Collecl Cyclone Debls

A funding committee is to be
formed immediately for collection
of bills owed the 1941 Cyclone,
campus annual, Clint Taylor,
president of the senior class said
today.

Bills amounting to at least 5757
have not been paid and the
senior class was notified of the
situation last Monday in a let-
ter from Herschel M. Colbert,
chairman of the publications
board.

Carmody Connected.

Thomas Carmody, Cyclone bush
ness manager last year, who left
school early this fall, has been
contacted by the class and has
sent a statement. AS this state-
ment was incomplete, the senior
class is trying to contact him
ngain to secure further informa-
tion, Taylor said.

Owed Money.

The school owes money, as do
several of the school organiza—
tions, and when this is collected
the annual will have within $100
of the necessary funds to clear
the books.

“We need the records carmody
has to be sure about the remain—
ing 3100,” Taylor said.

A meeting of the officers or
the class is to be held Wednes-
day night to discuss the situation,
Taylor said,
