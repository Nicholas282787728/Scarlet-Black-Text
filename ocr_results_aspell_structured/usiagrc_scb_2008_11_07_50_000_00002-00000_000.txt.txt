Halloween thievery hits Harris

BYAIHANISFELD

While a number of students painted their faces white and
their mouths red in honor of The Dari Km'g/JI, some person or
people decided to actually mimic the Joker's penchant for chaos
at Harris this Halloween.

At least nine incidents of theft were reported to Security
in connection with the Halloween Harris party, which oc-
curred this past Saturday. In addition to the thefts, people's
belongings were put in other people’s coats and bags and
strewn about. The Halloween incidents are among a string
of thefts that have occurred on campus in the past
weeks

According to Stephen Briscoe. direcr
tor of Security, the thefts occurred in
the coatroom of the Harris Center
sometime between 11 p.m. and
12:30 a.m. Items stolen included
wallets, watches, as well as p- and
social security cards.

security and the Grinnell Po»
lice have both begun to investigate
the thefts, but Eriscoc declined to
comment on the details of the MIT
vestlganon, “Vl/c're going to try and
find out who's doing it," Briscoc said.

“And there’s going to be some kind or
repercussions for what they've done."

According to Eyob Mclcs '10, the ACE
security chief on duty that night, nothing unusual
was noted until the party was dying down. “No one at all saw or
reported any suspicious behavior," he said.

While some students were forced to cancel credit cards
and change their locks, other students were simply bafﬂed by
the manner in which personal items were moved about. “Apr
patently some items got switched, for example, cell phones
endcd up in someone else's bag,"Mcles said. “And it was just
kind of odd.”

Amanda Gotera ’09 placed her p-card,watch and key
in her friend’s bag, which was later emptied. “Her bag was come
pletely empty but we found her cowboy hat on the ﬂoor," she
said. “And her camera was like tied to the coat rack on the other

Votes

sidc ofthe room, and then all ofher stuffwas in three different
corners.”

According to Gotera, as people trickled out of Har-
ris they began to notice that other people’s belongings were in
their possession. “People were like ‘oh my God, this is not
my p-eard and it’s in my purse' and ‘this is not my camera.”

Gotera said. "Stuffgets moved around at Harris, but there was
stuttzippcd into people's coats."

According to both Briscoe and Ben Howoit '09, direc-
tor of ACE Security, the thefts in the coatroom are not
unprecedented. “It kind of comes in waves, so there’ll be
no thefts at all and then there will be a bunch of thefts in

one night,” Howort said. “And [then] we'll have to sit

down and devise some srnitegies,"
The thefts at Harris are one of
three incidents involving stealing
on campus recently. According to
emails from Briscoc and Travis
Greene, dean of Students, items
had been stolen from automobiles
parked near East campus, and in
another instance a student entered
another's dorm room while the resir
dents were sleeping and took an item
from their room, one CTlTlﬂLl said.
“It’s deﬁnitely something we’re go-
ing to address but I think it’s too early
to say if it’s a trend.” said John Burrows '10,
chair of Safety and Security Advisory Committee
and SGA vice president of Student Affairs.

Howort said that some potential solutionsisuch as star
rioning an extra staff member in the eoatroom, or installing a
closed circuit cameraiseemed extreme. “I think the best plan,
would honestly be putting up a sign in the coatroom that says
‘don't leave valuables here,m he said.

A common comment among those interviewed and in the
security e-mails was that students have a false sense of secu-
rity while on campus. “While we would like to think that a
residential sclfrgovcrning community like ours is immune from
such incidents, the simple truth is that we are not," Greene's
email read.
