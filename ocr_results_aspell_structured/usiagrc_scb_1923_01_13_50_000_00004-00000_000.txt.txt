u"“""‘""‘"‘ n and Toyssen works were present at
the Essen conference. In both con-
iel‘ences the delegates were rather
non-committal but the impression rev
ceived by the French was that the
German industries would reiuse to co—
operate. “
The United States has decided to stay
on the fence in the German-French
dispute and so has declined to make
‘any answer to the “protest" of the
German government against the French
acunpaﬁon of the Ruhr ~legion. The
administration feels that it has done
. all in its power alredﬂy to alleviate the
' ituation in a peaceful manner. its ad—
vances in that. direction have been re-
,iected, and it refuses to do any more
‘as we are not looking for trouble.

To Settle Clilmtpitmsllip. :

Last year there was much discus
sion us to the best team in the tourna- 1
meet but there was no way of making
a decision. The A team oi Lnngan:
Hall and the B team oi Building Three l
were .uudctcated throughout the se.-:
son but plans for a,game between.
these two teams, which never met inl
tonruamcut‘ nlay, fell through and the .
best team was never decided. This
detect would be remedied under tbc
proposed plan.

Mr. Rogers also states that he
would like to run other sports such
i indoor baseball, handball, etc, as
illter-dol'tlliwry games but that the
limited lacilitics of the gymnasium
will not permit them.
