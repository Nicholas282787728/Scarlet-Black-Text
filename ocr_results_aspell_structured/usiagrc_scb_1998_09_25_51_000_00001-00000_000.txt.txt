Enrolmentdrop means
big and in school aid

By JOHN ISRII

News editor

ER

Calling ii 1| "tliSdStct" for thc Grin-
nethcwbing School District, Assis~
tant Superintendent Tcil‘y Peters was
ready Wednesday to lnfoini school
board members iinii a drop in student
cnrollmcni will rnciin “zero" budget
growth for tho “19972000 School year.

Ofﬁcialcrit‘ollnrcritligiircsshowthat
77fcwerstudentsareattendingclasses
in the school district than last year,

That rrzinshitcs into a loss of ap»
proxnitntcly $275,000 in state aid to
Gn‘mielleNcn'burg. a ﬁnnitciul hit that
is likely to force the district into a
pcriodofnustci'ltyandbcltetlghtcning.

1,830 students in schools

The school census taken this week
shows that there arc l,830 students
attending classes in the district, come
pared with L907 during the 1997-98
school district.

Thcre Inc now 18 fewer elementary
students. Grinircll Middle School has
anenrolliricni loss of42.AndGn'nncll
High School has oxpciicnccd an en-
rollment drop of l7, Peters told The
Herald-Registerchncsdayaftemoon.

Equally important is the so—callcd
budget enrollment, which includes all
students'aitending classes in the dis-
triet, spcciiil- -ctluciitiori students who
are tullloiicd out" to other schools,
open enrollment students attending
classes in oilrcrtlistricts and a “weight-
ing" of 0.6 for each student who is
thCASCllOOICd

The actual building enrollment in~
eludes lullioircd—inspcclal students, as

well as open-enrollment students at-
tending from other districts.

No new money for ’99

“It's a disaster," Peters said. “There
will be no new money for the next
school year."

Each enrolled studentis Worth about
$4,000 in state aidto the schooldist 'Ict.

“When I did my analysis of where
we were last year compared to this
year, kindergarten enrollment was
down to l 18, and we had 130 graduat-
ing seniors," Peters said. “So there is a
drop of 12 that We can account for.

“In moving from ﬁrst to second grade,
we lost nine students; from grade six to
seven, we lost seven. From grade nine
to 10, we lost 12. Those are the three
big ones. He had a class or two gain a
studcnt, and scveml lost two or three.
But it was generally spread out. More
moved out than moved in.”

Board to look at options

The GeN Board of Education must
now wrestle with the district‘s budget
and try to ﬁnd ways to compensate for
the loss ofstate perpupil aid. The bad
news won't affect the school year that
began last month and will end in the
spring. But it will have a major impact
when students return to class late next
summer.

“How we want to proceed will den
pend a lot on some direction from the
board,” Peters said. “But we will need
to be looking at where we‘re going Io
be in 19994000. We’ll have to do
some budget-tightening."

No ﬁrm decision are expected be-
fore the ﬁrst of next year.

Extension Office offers
help to stressed farmers

‘ The Poweshiek County Extension
Ofﬁcewillhelpagriculturalproducers
who are facing ﬁnancial and family
stress ﬁnd help.

The Extension Ofﬁce, along with
the Iowa Concern Hotline (1-80074477
1985) will help farmch ﬁnd the name
of an Extension associate, farm man-
agement field specialist or other per-
son who can perform ﬁnancial analy-
ses and offer suggestions to those suf-
fering from the current low commod-
ity and livestock prices.

Many are- comparing today's site
uation with the ﬁnancial crisis in agri~
culture during the 19805.

‘Not powerless‘

“Fan-Tiers who are experiencing ﬁ-
nancial difﬁculties and stress are not
powerless," said John R. Baker, an
attorney for Iowa Concern Hotline.

There are several actions farmers
and families can take, he said. Among
them:

- Make sure that the family can
tinues to cominunicaicconccrriingthc
situation.

- Discuss feelings and actions that
the family members can take,

- Make certain that ﬁnancial records

“Stayin contactwith yourcrcditors,
but do not agree to any actions until
you have a clear idea of tlic effect of
what you are agreeing to do,“ Baker
said. “Remember. what you agree to
do you will heoxpoctcd to perform. Be
realistic about your situation, Do‘ not
be overly optimistic or pessimistic."

Must ﬁle for mediation

Before any creditor can begin any
collection activity for a debt in excess
of$20,000 that is secured with agricul-
tural property, the creditormust ﬁle for
mediation, Baker said, After that ﬁlv
ing, the producer will have 21 days to
respond to any information request
sent to him or her by the Iowa Mediar
tion Service.

“After your response is received, a
mediation session will be held within
zi days,” Baker said. “Be prepared to
discuss your situation and have a pro-
posal prepared on how the problem
may be remedied.

“Finally, ﬁnd appropriate help to
deal withthe situation."

Such help, he said, may include an
attorney, accountant, farm man-

An orgy of revealing
past indiscretions

Something very unpleasant is taking place in Washington now that the
Starr report is in wide circulation and the nation is bracing itselffor President
Clinton‘ 5 videotaped grand yury testimony. Suddciil y, reports are appearing
in the nation 5 newspapers concerning the past sexual indiscretions ofcertain
members of Congress. Rep. Dan Burton oflndiaiia was the ﬁrst to reveal
that, yes, he’d fathered a child no one kirew about. Since then, two more
representatives, Including Judiciary Committee Chainmtn Henry Hyde of
Illinois, have been forced to make similar admissions ofthlngs that happened
years ago.

In one way, revealing hypocrisy seems appropriate and may even be
satisfying to some. But, in another way, there' is something very unseemly
about a campaign to unveil every lapse injudgmcnt, every sexual ﬂing that
really has no bearing on anything. The only goal. it seems, is the embarrass-

merit ofpublic ofﬁcials 7 yes, the
president included.

There's a lot of finger-pointing
going on as the result oftlic
revelations. Not surpnslngly, some
Republicans — including Majority
Whip Tom DcLay of Texas w
charge that the White House is
responsible for digging up din and
making sure it gets to reporters.
(Actually, the former husband oftlie

woman with whom Hyde was involved has aid he was the source for that
story, and thcjounialists involved have conﬁrmed it.) Others bltrrnc an over-
zealous and outeoticoiitrol prcss.

Are there more “gotcha" stores in the works? Almost certainly. And it's a
shame, It docsn’I really make any difference wlitit the sources for such stories
are. The sad thing is that they're being written at all. Some people will say
those who are having their pasts held up to scrutiny deserve it, particularly if
they‘ve been sanctimonious about Bill Clinton's escapades, But we'd bct that
the vast majority of Americans find it all very offensive rind pointless. It is a
rare person who hasn’t done something that lie or slic isn't particularly proud
ofand would prcfcr that it remain private.

is America in the gnps of some great national compulsion to expose
everything questionable that public officials have done, no matter how long
ago? So it sccrns. The result may well be that fewer and fewer cornpelent
people will offer themselves for public service, Alrczitly, Gov. George W.
Bush ochxas has indicated that he might not sock the Republican presidcn~
tiaI nomination in 2000, saying that he tiocsii't Want his family to be placed
under the microscope by relentleSSJotll'nLlllSlS. Others may have similar
misgivings.

It's time to stop this orgy ofretribution for pasi mistakes and gel on with
the business of running the country, Lord knows there tric enough ICiIl
problems out there to be addressed
