Coverage of Films misleading, distasteful

I would like to express my shock and dis
taste at the way the SE58 portrayed both my
efforts as Films Chair and the work of our
student projectionists in the article “Projectr
ing Problems Continue"and the staff editorial
“Watching ovei' Films” of its September 23rd
edition. I‘ll also try to clarity and respond to
some otthe concerns these articles presented.

The 5871? offered a lot of positive informar
tion about the state of 35mm film projection at
Grinnell. For instance, the article mentioned
the fact that 1 am a trained
projectionist and am thus
an available resource for
projection troubleshoot-
ing, and that I added more
training this year. How
ever, the slant of the article
makes it seem as though we've done next to
nothing to prevent films problems.

The first important thing to point out is
that we are privileged to have our own cinema
with a professionalrgrade 35mm projector, and
that both students and community members
enjoy these amenities free of charge. This is
not the case at the majority of colleges, where
students have to pay to see films off or on cam-
pus.

The reason we show 35mm movies, as ope
posed to VHS or DVD, is because 35mm films
are ofhigher picture and sound quality and are
available sooner. Showing 35mm movies also

My actions as Films (hair have
been, and will continue to be above
and beyond what’s expected of me.

piovides another much needed place for on-
campus student employment, while beneﬁting
the whole community.

The second thing that perhaps the S558
and the rest of the student body isn’t aware
of is that we had ﬁve highly experienced pro—
jectionists last year and there were still major
projecting problems. This year there are only
two projectionists with more than a year’s ex-
perience, and one of them is I. considering
this, and raking into account the usual startr
ofrtheryear bugs, our pros
jectionists have been doing
a standoutjob.

Thirdly, as the Films
Chair, I was accused of
“shirking on [my] dance“
and being someone who
“does not make sure movies run smoothly and
who does not release the movie schedule in a
timely manner,” which the sea; views as my
two primary responsibilities.

These accusations are completely mis-
leading. The SGA constitution describes my
primary responsibilities as to select and order
the films that play at Harris on weekends and
chair the Films committee.

This does not include training projection
ists or micromanaging each film projection.
The Films Chair isn’t technically required
to know the ﬁrst thing about how to project
a ﬁlm. I have done everything I could do to

make ﬁlms run smoothly: l'vc accompanied
the projectionist on duty to make sure the
ﬁlms are loaded successﬁrlly, and projectionists
have my cell phone number so they can call
me if there are any problems. My actions as
Films Chair have been, and will continue to be,
above and beyond what’s expected otrnc.

The final thing to remember is that both I
and our projectionists are students whose goal
it is to learn. Since when were student workers
infallible? Both the SGA Films committee and
the Sﬁa’B are funded from our student activi-
ties fund, and I believe that we both strive for
excellence given our responsibility to students.
Despite this, when was there ever an issue of
the SHE that was completely free of errors?

Due to the experience necessary to respond
quickly and errectively to projecting problems,
technical difficulties will, unfortunately, occur.
However, I’m constantly brainstorming ways
for our shows to go smoother and I‘m open to
any and all constructive suggestions.

Considering the SGE's persistent flaws and
supposed dedication to accountability, its staff
was completely unjustiﬁed and unprotessional
in issuing such speculative criticism towards
me without any real evidence or public outcry
about my “laziness or abuse,"1t's too bad that
our “government watchdog” is busy chasing its
tail.

Sincerely,

Lidtka lacks evidence, logic

Mr. Lidtka's letter in last week’s SHE cont
sisted mostly of a “critique" of evolution. As
individuals concerned with the state of science
education in this country, we feel obligated to
point out some of its numerous misundersmndr
ings, logical errors and irrelevaneies.

From die letter, it appears that Mr. Lidtka
does not actually know what evolutionary theory
is or what it seeks to explain. Simply put, evolu-
tion is the process by which allele frequencies in a
population oforganisms change over time. Evor
lutionary biologists study these chaiigekwhen,
where, how and, most importantly, why they oc-
cur.

we would also like to point out that evolur
tion does not attempt to explain the origin ofliw
ing things, known as abiogenesis. Evolution is a
process that is independent of the origin of life,
except insofar as it cannot occur without living
things.

Clearly, the first six of Mr. Lidtka’s twelve
questions to ask about evolution have nothing to
with evolution. They are primarily questions for
physics, astronomy and chemistry. Perhaps Mr.
Lidtka would like “alternative" theories taught in
those classes as well)

Even ifIVlt. Lidtka’s criticisms had any merit,
they still would not constitute an argument in
favor of intelligent design. His entire argument
is built upon the the premise that evolution and
intelligent design are the only possible explanar

tions for the diversity oflife, and so rtevolution
can be proved false, intelligent design will be true
by default.

Unfortunately foi Mr. Lidtka, there are nu-
merous other possible explanations. Flying Spar
ghetti Monster Theory has been gaining credr
i ility on the Internet, so discrediting evolution
is clearly not proof for intelligent design.

In fact, one would have to disprove inﬁnitely
many other theories in 0,,

def for intelligent design f/y/‘ng Spaghetti Monster Theory
has been gaining credibility on the
lnlernel, so ll/SUﬂl/flﬂg evolution is
not proofforinlel/l‘genl dot/go,

to be the only possible ex-
p1anation.1n light of this.
it would certainly be easier
for Mr. Lidtka to present
evidence in favor ofan intel-
ligcnt designer. The style of
argumentation used in his letter is a strong state-
ment about the lack of such evidence.
on the subject of the twelve questions, we
would also like to point out that they are cope
ied, almost verbatim, from the website of Aus-
tralian cieationist “Dr.” Kent Hovind (tomb.
drdino.mm, “Qiestions for Evolutionists"). The
only substantive change was in Mr. Lidtka’s ﬁnal
question, “Is it possible that similarities in design
between different animals prove that they had a
common designer instead of a common ancesr
tor?" In the original version, “Creator" is used
instead of“desig-ner
This is further evidence for what many of us

have long known — that the intelligent design
movement is - nply a rehashing of good ol'fashr
ioncd Creationism.

A pointrby»point refutation of Mr. Lidtka’s
criticisms could easily fill the entire scars. For
those who are interestednve refer you to TalkOr
rgins (www.m/torrgr’nrorg) and 'l‘nlkDesign
(warmth/Merging), where these, and many
other criticisms, are thoroughly discussed.

The real question is how
committed Mr. Lidtka is
to this sort of argumefim-
tion. Does the notion that
students should be taught
“alternative ideas" apply only
to evolution, or is he open-
rnindcd enough to cxtcnd it
to any idea that has as much or less evidence in
its favor than evolution?

If the former is true, dais is clearly not an is-
suc otopcnncss but of personal ideological opt
position to certain ideas.

If it is the latter, we would like to pumphtase
late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould:
The evidence in favor of evolution vastly out-
strips the evidence in favor of the existence ofJUr
lius Caesar. Should students be taught the “No
Julius Caesat"veision ‘ofworld history, as well as
dae conventional version.>

Support community service groups

In response to the many requests for fund
mg from student groups that focus on com»
munity service projects, the Student Programs
ming Committee (SPC) would like to explain
our reasons for funding allocation and hope
fully spark discussion about the broader issue
of insufficient institutional support for com
munity servtce groups.

The SPC is m the process ofscaliiig back
our contributions to community service proj-
ects Though we recognize the importance of
community service, the school has a commue
nity service office that should be fully funded
to support these great projects, The money

that SPC allocates comes from the student
activities fee that funds SGA. For some time
now SGA has been acting as an enabler, alt
lowing the College to underfund the commit-
nity serVice center.

Groups like Alternative Happy Hour,
the Prison Workshops Group, Poverty Aer
tion Now, Grinnell Women In Science, Davis
Buddies and Community Meal deserve the
college’s full support. However, because longs
standing community service projects are cute
rcntly funded at the expense ofothcr student
groups, we are choosing to reduce our corn-
mitment.

We hope that Grinnell college will begin
to sufficiently support the gtowmg numbeis
of students paiticipatmg in community ser-
vice projects, rillowing us to use the student
activities tee to support the broad and divcrse
array of student groups and sports clubs on
campus

editorial

Find a rabbi

expensive liberal arts school smack in
the middle of oomfields does not exactly lend
itself to a diverse student body Nevertheless,
Grinnell is a hamlet of economic, racial, eth-
nic and religious diversity in a relatively ho-
mogeneous surrounding community. Sure,
the college needs to make more progress on
all of these fronts, but we can appreciate how
much we have already achieved.

The college prioritizes diversity in its stu-
dent body. Need-blind admissions, POSSE,
multicultural and international student pros
gramming as well as a plethora of religious
service opn'ons all make Grinnell alittle more
attractive for those who may be reluctant to
exile themselves to natal Iowa.

In recent years, Gtinnell’s Jewish student
community has exempliﬁed how the eﬂec»
tiveness of a strong college oommicment to
diversity can translate into a strong presence
of diversity. The presence of a full-lime rabbi,
Deborah Erin, enabled the college to offer
a wide array of Jewish programming, which
fostered a supportive community for Jewish
students and strengthened campus religious
life as a whole. This, in turn, attracted more
Jewish students, adding to campus diversity.

When Rabbi Brin left last spring,we were
disappointed that the college opted to not fill
her position. After an outcry from members
of Chalutzim and other student groups, the
college wisely chose to compromise by seek-
ing a part-time mbbi. Two month into the
school year, the search has been fniitless.

While we hope that those involved in the
hiring process maintain their high standards,
we must also recognize that Grinncll is not
the ﬁrst place rabbis look to for employment.
A more agressive recruitment plan should be
enacted if the college expects to ﬁll this posi~
tion within a reasonable amount of time.

The job description for the rabbi position
is currently rogue and confusing. It demands
that the person hired fulfill “alternative du—
ties as needed by the college,” though it never
describes what those duties may be Admin-
istrators should consider whether this tacked
on clause gives the appearance of greater flex-
ibility on the college’s part, or whether it sim-
ply causes conﬁision and discourages qualiﬁed
candidates from applying for a position that
only makes use of their professional training
half the time. Also, just as it sometimes takes a
little extra effort to attract “minority"students
to come to rural Iowa, maybe the college
should consider odering stronger incentives
to rabbi candidates, or at least ensure that
their time is well spent.

We recognize that only two months have
passed, and that student Rabbi Daria Jacobs
has done a remarkable job ﬁlling in on High
Holidays. We are not sounding any arms
wet); we want to make sure that the hiring
process reﬂects the college's overall commit~
ment to diversity.
