Fine Arts thefts

remain a puzzle

by Trena Clcland

Tightened security and a slight
increase in paranoia have resulted
from a series of five burglaries in
the Fine Arts building before
Christmas vacation.

The burglaries all took place in
the Roberts Theatre basement.
where the theatre department
offices, dressing and makeup
rooms, storage rooms and drafting
rooms are located. The first victim
was Leslie Rose, publicity
secretary and Grinnell student,
who had her wallet stolen from her
office in October when she stepped
out momentarily. Money was
taken from ﬁle wallet, which was
later found outside.

ln mid-October. during the run oi
”Skin of Our Teeth," the dressing
room was burglarized. It was
discovered that the burglar or
burglars had entered the room
while virtually the entire cast was
performing on stage and had stolen
money and valuables from their
clothes. .

in November, a storage closet
used by a Building and Grounds
worker was broken into and the
maid’s wallet taken. It was not

Interdisciplinary programs
being considered

The new interdisciplinary
studies program, financed by an
$200,000 AW. Mellon Foundation
grant, IS now under consideration
by the Curriculum Committee and,
it approved, will be implemented
in the fall of 1977.

The new program will allow a
student to declare a secondary
area of concentration, separate
from the major According to
Professor Al Jones. a chairman of
one of the five interdisciplinary
areas. the program will “give the
students a sense of structure in
their nonrmajor course Selection.“

The following five areas Will be
offered for concentration in the
proposed interdisciplinary
curriculum:

iRegional and Community
Studies (focus on the Midwest)
directed by Alan Jones, history
professor;

>Environmental
Benjamin Graham,
professor;

iLatin American Studies,
Dennis Perri, Spanish professor;

~East European Studies,
Gregory Guroff, history professor,

~West European Studies, Victor
Verrette, French professor
These instructors Will also act as
advisors in each of their areas.

In an allrfaculty memo dated
February 2, Deans Waldo Walker
and Mary Eysenbach made it clear
that the new programs had been
“developed with careful con-
sideration of the existing Grinnell
courses, library resources, and
faculty expertise,” The memo
further stated that a certain
amount of “faculty retooling and
course development . . . will go
forward as soon as the programs

returned despite pleas in the 5&8
and the Campus Memo.

During an “Arms and the Man”
performance in early December, a
young man whom no one
recognized was seen loitering
around the basement halls. It was
later found that Rose’s wallet had
again been taken from her office.
The burglar had apparently gone
into the drafting room and climbed
over the wall into Rose's office,
which is separated from the
ceiling.

According to theatre department
designer and technical director
.Ian Czechowski, nobody is sure
that the stranger in the building at
the time is the burglar. However,
“that was the only time anyone
saw somebody suspicious kind of
snooping around," he said.

The last incident was just prior
to Christmas break, when music
instructor Kathleen Hansell had
her purse taken from her office. It
was later found, minus her money,
stuffed in a Fine Arts building
locker. .

The theatre department has not
made an organized effort to notify
the Grinnell police; Czechowski

are approved. No additions of fullr
time laculty are required and none
are contemplated." However, the
present plan is to restructure
certain courses in accordance with
the new grouping.

Pa rt of the Mellon grant has been
allocated towards faculty
development. This will enable a
small number of professors over
the next couple of years, to expand
their knowledge and upgrade their
teaching ability by auditing
courses at other Schools or by
attendlng summer classes. Money
will also be used to bring in lec-
turers and to run summer
seminars in order to facilitate
discussion on the various aspects
of running these programs.

it approved, each in
terdisciplinary concentration will
require a minimum of so credits
and will culminate in a “senior
research seminar or research
project. Eight credits of work
counted toward a concentration
may also be counted in a student's
major where appropriate."

says that, H ,. . it was left up to the
indi dual people to notify the
police if they wanted.” At least one
victim has done so.

The burglary of an old. ex-
pensive set uf drums owned by a
member of the troupe which

erformed “Gauguin in Tahiti”
ast semester is not thought to be
connected with the other thefts.

Both Rose and Czechowski
bemoaned the crimes and ex
pressed hope that they will it"
continue into second semester?
Czechowski admits that the
basement is “an easy mark” for
thieves, because ”people have a
tendency to leave doors open, We
leave our offices unlocked when we
step out for a minute. The problem
is that we should be able to use the
facilities down here and not have to
use locks and keys.” A concerted
effort is now being made by the
staff to lock storage rooms and
other little-used rooms,

“yo-time victim Rose echoed
Czechowski's disappointment.
”The students really use the
basement. The [act that we now
have to worry about being ripped-
off is really a shame,” she said,

about the new curriculum. “The
school Is doing this with a minimal
expense to existing majors, We are
not just taking bits and pieces from
here and adding them there."
Walker went on to say that he was
pleased with “the tightness of the
program,"

At last week's Curriculum
Council meeting, procedure a.
consideration of the specific area
proposals was established. This
week, two or the area chairmen
will go before the committee to
present _ their curriculuﬁ-
proposals. The remaining thre
will follow the same procedure in
later meetings. The Curriculum
Committee will meet this Thur-
sday at 4:20 in Burling Viewing
Room, This is an open meeting and
student participation is invited.
