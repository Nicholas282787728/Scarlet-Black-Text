Album Review

by Eric A. Johnson and Thomas A
Beverly

The group Television was one of
the seminal punk bands oi the
mid-ms, distinguished by their “17
tricate guitar Work at a time when
three chords were enough for most
of their cohorts. A decade later, the
two guitarists spawned by that
band continue to record solo
material; each has now released a
new album.

Tom Verlaine was the lead
guitarist and vocalist of Television
and provided most of the
songwriting. “Flashlight" is his
fifth Solo effort, and it maintains
the sort of consistency that won
him Critical acclaim for previous
albums.

Richard Lloyd was a good
guitarist in a group with a great
on and thus never gained the
visibility enjoyed by Verlaine. His
solo Career has been shorter;
“Real Tlme” is his tlnrd release. It
is a live recording irom CBGB, the
club where Television got its start.

TOM: There is little doubt that
Veriaine is the superior artist.
“Flashlight" is not his finest solo
effort; that distinction belongs to
his seli'rtitled debut and its follow
up, “Dreamtime,” which stand as
two of the best obscure treasures of
the late 7Ds/early dos, Verlaine’s
voice is an acquired taste, but is
periect for the otten deeply per
sonal lyrics or his songs.
“Flashlight” sometimes lacks the
meiodicism oi his earlier work,

though Verlaine's more relaxed
style shows the culmination oi an
artistic maturing begun on his
previous two albums, “Words
From The Front” and “Cover."
with his guitar work as fascinating
as ever, Verlaine oiiers an ap
propriate next chapter to his solo
career.

“Real Time” shows Lloyd to be a
solid live pcriormer but an unex-
citing writer and singer. The songs
are aboveaverage for the day, but
they lack ﬂair and melodic hooks
Though “Misty Eyes" and “9” are
excellent songs, they cannot come
pare with “At 4 aim." and “The
Funniest Thing," the best from
“Flashlight." Lloyd's guitar lines
frequently lapse into familiar
heavy-metal speed cliches, and in
the same way they lack purpose.
His speed is costly in live perfor~
mance, where his oiten sloppy runs
can be downright abrasive. Never-
theless, “Real Time" is pleasant
enough to listen to and shows plenr
ty of potential

RATINGS: “Flashlight" a
and “Real Time” a ‘C.’

ERIC: Richard Lloyd shows a
much different persona than did
Television. He is a craftsman, put»
Yting together an album of
unimaginalive but solidly built
songs. At his best, he has a slightly
strangled voice and plays catchy
melodies with simple lyrics. At his
worst, he does passable imitations
of Verlaine solos and sounds really
strangled.

Tom Verlaine continues in his
role of eccentric genius. His
songs don't have the structure of
Lloyd’s; they twist all over the
place. Verlaine's guitar scrapes
and stammers the melody, never
letting it quite take shape, then
unleashes one of his ringing solos.
His voice sounds beyond strangle
ed; it is dead, and it provides a
haunting counterpart to the music.
“The Scientist Writes a Letter" is
my favorite tune. Verlaine
sings/talks a letter to his love.
quietly talking about what he is
studying. The guitar alternately
wails and moans between the
verses, showing the feelings he
doesn’t know how to put into
words.

RATINGS: “Real Time" a ‘C+'
and “Flashlight“ a ‘B+.’
