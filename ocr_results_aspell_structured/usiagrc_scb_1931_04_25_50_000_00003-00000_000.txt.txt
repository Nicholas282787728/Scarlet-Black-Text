Doric editors have been worried by‘

the lack of material furnished from
the student body. The tamous tribe
that has been a constant source of
supply has deﬁnitely failed us. and
_ we need new blood capable of pulling
boners. Won't some party please step
in and ﬁll the gap?

Shep Taylor anticipated our call
for help by landing with both feet,
that is at least one foot. Being un-
able to ﬁnd a parking space for
peds during a recent blanket
tangle, he very obligingly placed
one of them in the pie. Dessert
was not served at the end of that

repsst.

The girls go for Tipton and hold
him in any manner possible. This
time it was by stopping the alter
rotor between doors, while he was
busily engaged in removing worn
out love letters, and other reluse
train the balls or the blessed. We
would like very much to know the
terms by which Tip gained his
release We have our suspicions!

statistics prove that, if all the cars

There must be a certain amount
of excitement in knowing that
you have only 19 seconds to live.
Whenever you feel another im-
pulse to inhale a poison gas, why
don‘t you pick one that kills you

much less suspense.

Subscribers will be interested to

Miss Helen Kauffroan, now that she
has shifted her heavy burden to other
shoulders, has taken up juggling, and
already shows a natural aptitude for
that art. An exhibition of her prowV
ess will be held at a date to be an-
nounced later—probably much later.

We wonder about Sylvia Sawyer.

Surely she didn’t run into a door

in the dark. We're hoping Sylvia‘s

story is less prosaic and more con-
vincing.

Do you think Grinnell should es-
tablish experimental courses in journ-
olisrn, teaching, and such subjects,
which the student would work in ac-
tual business part oI the time?

June Moore: Under present condi-
tions it would hardly be practicali
Grinnell isn't a large enough town.
Some such plan migbt he used in
teaching courses if an arrangement
could be made with public schools.

Juno Carlson: It would be good in
journalism, but in a town the size of
Grinnell it would not be practical, I
don’t know about teaching.

waiter Sceor: I think it would be
practical. I don’t know much about
journalism. It would give students a
chance to put theory into practice,
and that would be an improvement.

Isabel Fortnc think it would be
an excellent thing but hardly practir
cal in a town of this size. It wouldn't
make much difference to students
majoring in economics, history, and
such subjects.

nudley Joy: It wouldn’t be practir
cal.

MacDonald’s Piano Recital

in Herrick Chapel Monday
Impressive Artistic Event

The piano recital by Sarah Innes
MacDonald, assistant professor of
p‘ianofoi-te, given in Herrick chapel
last Monday evening. assisted by the
Grinnell string quartet, was an im-
pressive artistic event.

Miss MacDonald showed that she
possesses what so many otherwise
estimable pianists lackia sense tor
program building. Not only did she
play works ot the greatest nineteenth
century composers, plus a very in-
teresting modern group, but these
works were so contrasted as to set
off each to the best advantage.

Also Miss MacDonald has superh
technical mastery which is so com-
plete that it calls no attention to it-
self. There is such a thing as virtuo-
sity which conceals virtousity. Hers
is of this sort.

Finally, there is a mixture of
thought, sensitive imagination, and
refinement of touch which results in
the highest type ot interpretive sense.
The vibrantly romantic Schumann,
the ecstatic Chopin, the tenderly
rugged Brahms, all were given with
the clarity which is only possible to

 

an artist of penetrating insight.
