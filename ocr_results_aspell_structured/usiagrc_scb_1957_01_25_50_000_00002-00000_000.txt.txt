This is the final issue of the present Scarlet and Black
staff. Next semester, Lori DeLay and her new staff will be
responsible for the paper. I wish them luck and success.

The S&B has had an excellent year. Much of the credit
must go to Ed Jantz, out—going business manager. He has
served in this capacity for two years. During this time,
parentalumni subscriptions have been more than doubled,
and advertising revenue was greatly increased. This has
permitted lls to have larger papers, including four twelve-
pag‘e editions, and more pictures.

I wish to add special thanks to Mrs. Prescott of the-
Information Service. Her help and cooperation have been
invaluable. . /

The entire staff membership deserves special recogni-
tion for the work they have done. The following names are
never seen in print, but they have worked willingly and
faithfully on the paper:

Kris Anundsen, Noel Bacchus, Gerri Beatty, Joyce Beli-
nett, Judy Bourne, Betty Brandt, Betty Brodd, Mary Lou
Brooks, Barbara Burns, Sheen Clark, Arlene/Cleveland,
Chuck Copeland, Peggy Frank. ' ~

“Best thing rvc seen at Grim

marvelous performance” . .

“You all deserve an Arplus" . .
. “A professional Job" . . .

The above comments were
made, of course, in praise of
last Saturday night's performs
ance of Dylan Thomas' play.
"Under Milk Wood." it more
than satlsfied everyone's expecr
tatlons and deserved every bit
of the “rave” reaction that it
received.

The warmest congratulations
are due to the cast rind to
the studcnt director, David
Steiner, who faced and met
well some very difficult prob-
lems of , interpretation. The
lighting was well done and
the excellent progrnms gave
the show a “finishing touch."

Even the Gl'innell audience
surpassed all expectations. The
people out front that night can
only be described as “mature”
uniooning that they listened
carefully, laughed in the right.
places, and weren’t afraid to
respond when they did.

Perhaps one measure of the
show’s success can be taken
from the reaction of the faculr
ty, who went downstairs to the
makeup room to offer their cons
gratulations ._ not their usual
practice. .

Many are asking “When can
wc see it again?" Right now
it seems as if “Undel- Milk
Wood" is the logical choice (it
not the only choice) for pre»

pllblicity, they would not have as many grievances against
the S&B.

There is also a difference between a news story, and
an editorial or column, which expresses the opinions of the
writer. All newspapers contain these columns. They should
not be taken as negative criticisms, but as thoughtful com-

There are also indications
