“IIIILTIVATIIIII” [IF LIFE
IS IIII. STEINEH’S SUBdEI‘iT

In Vespers Atltli'c , IIc Urges TlmI.
America oi Future Mi"lli Not Be-
COIIID Grunt llilllurl lie or
(‘utlllurrt‘inl Nation.

"Rel _inu is :t lite ciiltiialcd unto
God in the presence of (\u nligllsL iii-
ture.” Such “as the emphatic (leer
iaration of Dr. Steiner in his address
delivered at Vespers last Sunday on
the subject, “The Cultivation ot Lite."

“Today some are seeking God in the
presence ol' death, in the smoke of hot-
tle," said Di Steiner. “But we, are
we not cultivating lite in the presence
of luxuries, holding God in distant reA
seivc? Religion is ol‘ no value unless
it becomes an incentive, a guide tor
better living."

The Speaker urged that. life be elli-
tiraied with a thought [or the nation's
future, [or the future of our counti .
will he \\‘l|£\I. we make it., its better-
ment or deterioration lies in our
hands. There are two Americas one
in which we are tiling arid one vrbich
we are building, and it is the latter
which holds the more import.

In conclusion, Dr. Steiner expressed
the desire that the America which we
are building might not he a grcat mil-
itaristic nor it rich commercial lla-
tion, but he hoped it might liccoinc d
a new and better type, iiiouldcd under
the guidance of God.
