Dorm Mishap

Loss Small

Job Superintendent
Explains Cause of»
Cemeni Collapse

The loss from the collapse of a
section of a newly cemented sec-
ond floor of the Cowles Dormi-
tory, Tuesday at 11 p. m,, was
estimated at a low figure by Mar-
tin Erickson, superintendent of

, construction, The floor, which had

been poured four hours, collapsed
without any known cause.

Erickson said the crew had fin-
ished the pouring of cement at
6:30 p. m. and had then covered
the floor with canvas at ,9 p. m.
When they left everything seemed
in good shape, and there was no
evidence of weakness in the sup-
port.

Although approximately one-
third of the floor space of the
second floor caved in, Pres. Sam-
uel N. Stevens said the delay
would be short and construction
would continue on schedule.

No damage was done to any
other part of the building. The
ground floor is still dirt, Erickson
stated. The noise of the collapse
was heard as far away as the
quadrangle and attracted most of
the populace of the dormitories.

Approximately 75 yards of con—
crete, all tile, and nearly all the
lumber used to construct the sec-
tion was destroyed, the superina
,tendent claimed.

DATE SET FOR BALL

The date for the Colonial ball was
set for February 7 at the W. A.
A, board meeting and picnic last
Friday evening.

The board also discussed plans
for organization of a hockey club,
and appointed a committee to re-
vise the W. A, A. constitution.
