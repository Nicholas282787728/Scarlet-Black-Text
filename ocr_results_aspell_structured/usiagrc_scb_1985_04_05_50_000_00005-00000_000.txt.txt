lie rose lrom the ground in time to
watch the van complete its roll, throw-
ing out both Toomsen and Preus. “My

lirst concern was that the van wouldn't
stop.” he said

Commenting on the ramifications of
this and other accidents involvnig stur
dent groups, Freeman said he does ex»
pect that some changes will be made in
the rules concerning student drivers.

Most 01 the recent accidents have in-
volved student drivers; however the ac—
Cldent involving the men's soccer team,
when the van crossed over a median in
to oncoming traffic. occurred while
Coach John Plitsch was at the wheel.

Long belore this accident the college
had ordered a bus which will be driven
by a proressional driver, Feeeman said.

Evelyn Freeman. women’s track
coach explained that the team had ac-
tually rented a school bus [or live
previous trips saying that it was much
sater and kept the whole team together.

Evelyn Freeman also felt that the col
lege should look over its policy agai .
But both coaches stressed that the ac
dent was “just something that happen-
ed."

This opinion was borne out by reports
from the Missouri State Highway
Patrol. Troopers on the scene l‘iled no
charges against anyone and indicted
that there was no apparent Violation of

rue democracy in~ the classroom

l)_\' nan L'ytroii
Shirley Williams, visiting Health proA
lessorgused a unique and slightly unorr

"thodox teaching method in her course
titled "The Elfects or information

"Technology on Modern Society." The
course compared the eilects ol infor-
mation technology on the US. Japan.

.ond Western Europe in the areas at
education. employment. and

tdemocracy

‘he teaching method Williams used
\\ as unique in that it depended {or more

,on the interaction between students
than the average college course.

istudents split the topics in the course
among themselves and then reported

‘their ﬁndings to the class.

i The reaction to this more interactive
method of teaching was, on the whole.
very good.

“1 lound it gave the class a leeling of

exchanging ideas rather than just
list mg to what the prolcssor had to
s' ' Lisa Van Sand said. “Her method
allowed each of us a chance to research
something we were interested in and
yet get many dllterent viewpoints on
lhe Subject in a very short time, [She
isi one or the most organized and well
prepared instructions l've ever had.”

Students were also impressed by
Williams warm and open manner. She
seemed genuinely as interested in what
students had to say as students were in
\\ hat she had to say. This was especial-
ly true during the times when groups oi
people ironi the class had the oppor
tunity tu have lunch with her.

”She was one of the most sociable
people i've every met . , . She wasn't
just interested in us as her students, but
in our litestyles and general viewpoints,

She even went down to the Pub and
spent time talking to us about things
that didn't even remotely concern the
class.‘,‘ stated Van Sand,
William} reaction to Gi'inilell
st d ms was also very positive
m quite impressed by the
sophistication of their [Grinncll stu-
dents} political knowledge, There
seems to be a stronger political com»
mitment about the campus now.
Though I suspect that is because that
was the end oi lcur years of Jimmy
Carter and this is the end of (our years
oi President Reagan. So in a fairly
Liberal Democratic campus like this
one {our years of Reagan has made
them feel more passionate and [our
years of Carter made them feel slightly
embarrassed and down in the mouth."
