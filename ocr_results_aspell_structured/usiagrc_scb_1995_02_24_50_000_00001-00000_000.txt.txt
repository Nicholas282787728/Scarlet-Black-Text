Students apathetic about rise in paper costs

By RIVA SHARPLES
Editor in Chief
THOUGH many Grinnell stun
dents say they are not wor-
ried about the rising costs of
paper and textbooks, experts say stu-
dents are bound to be affected — and
they aren't the only ones,
Publishers at Princeton Univere
sity Press in New Jersey, u major

store, have started seeking alterna-
tives to corrugated paper packing
materials and are looking for other
ways to cut down on paper usage as
pulp prices in the world market sky»
rocket.
Despite the fact that many paper
products at the Grinnell College

Bookstore , including textbooks ,
may see prree increases of up to 70
percent, many students say they aren't
overly worried about the rising costs.
Instead, they’ve got tests and papers
on their minds, they said, and having
to pay an extra dollar, while annoy-
ing, won't make much ol‘a difference
in their lifestyles.

Senior Jenny Wagner said the
increase may force her to start con-
serving paper a little more but won't
really bother her ﬁnanClally.

“I'm not that worried about it,"
Wagner said. “After four years of
leftovers, I have a lot ofextra paper
srtting around in my drawers, Also.
recycling bins area wonderful source
orseratch paper."

Junior Emily Bogusch said she
didn't know how she could change
her habits and use less paper, so she
won’t worry about it.

“I’m a student," Bogusch szticl
“I can't stop writing. I‘ll still need
paper in the future, so [the increase]
won’t be that big of a deal, But it
would be nice ifour country focused
more on recycling like they do in
Europe. Maybe this“ help."

Though some students may not
be upset now about the increases.
Princeton University Press Controlr
lcr Gary Frazec said he predicts that,
come next semester when it’s time to
buy textbooks, students will feel the

financial burden.
