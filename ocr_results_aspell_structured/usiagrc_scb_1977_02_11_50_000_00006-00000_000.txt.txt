“Z” and
Monty Python
to ﬁll the screen

by Bill Waldnei'

It’s Friday night in ARI-l
auditorium. The lights are turned
otf as the projectionist delivers his
familiar message.

“Focus it. Focus it," Chants the
crowd to the projectionist who
ignores them. mostly because he
hasn’t yet started the film.

The movie iinally starts, though.
and the title "France 1897" ap
pears to set the scene. A student
sitting next to me leans over to his
friend and says, “Ho. France
1597." In the next scene a man is
riding in a carriage. The student
says to his iriend, “Hey. He’s
riding in a carriage there.” The
film shows the man getting out of
the carriage and the student
reports, “He‘s gettin' out now
hey where’s he going?” The man
in the film begins to walk toward a
small house. “Looks like he’s
\valklng toward that small house,”
the student observes cleverly. The
man enters the house prompting
the student to warn his friend,
“Whoa , . . look out, I'll bet he‘s
gonna get killed and , .

“Aaagghhh . , ." He is Cut short
by my scream. “Uhh , , . eno-ough.
. . please enough‘. , , ., i plead
hysterically as i remove the
sawed-off shotgun from the gun
rack built into the seat in front of
me. “God forgive the . . . ” I think
and I open iire.

There are two great movies
scheduled for this weekend The
first is the movie I by director
Costa-Gavras. Costa-Gavras is the
director who made the film State of
Siege which was shown here last
semester on Latin American
weekend. Isuppose the best way to
classify his films would be to call
them political thrillers. They are
usually very “left” in their
political orientation, and always

 

very tast paced and slickly done
films. Costa-Gavi‘as has the ability
to engage the audience in the ac»
tion oi the film [mm the opening
scenes, and to hold their attention
throughout the film. His films
seem to move at an incredible
velocity, and his camera is con»
tinually reeling and darting about,

Z is the story of an investigation
which follows the ”accidental”
death of a leader of a Greek
paciiist movement, and the sub»
sequent discoveries that link
highly placed government officials
to the death. The deeper the in-
vestigalion probes, the more wide
spread the corruption seems to be,
implicating many very important
people; people who previously had
seemed to be above suspicion. The
iilm is sort of a Watergatergone-
sour (unless you happen to be a
Nixon supporter) story, only on a
more t ifying level.

This .ne movte has a lot going
for it. It has good acting, good
direction, and even a good musical
score. As Pauline Kael Said, Z is a
film that, “ . . . damn near knocks
you out of your seat."

in a completely different vein is
the second movie this weekend,
Monty Python's No“ ior Some-
thing Completely uiticrent. The
film is made up of a series of
unrelated, but bizarrely tied
together skits taken irom Monty
Python’s television show. It's an
hysterically funny film that I
personally think is much better
than their second effort (Monty
Python and the Holy Grail) if only
because the group works so much
better doing these shorter bits, The
film has a great variety of material
including “How Not To be Seen,"
“Twit of the Year" and the classic

song, “I’m a Lumberjack and I’m ' _

Okay (I Sleep All Night and I Work
All Day).”

weeks to film, and two years to

an additional “70 hours of sound

Muffie described most
documentaries as being
“somewhere in the grey area
between fact and fiction,” The
editor and director can manipulate
the lnedium by choosing and
discarding certain scenes, taking
scenes out of sequence, and em

while leaving others in the
