For people like me
who aren't able
remember their best
friends' birthdays but
can easily recall all or
the special
tombination moves of
their favorite Tekken
3 characters (and
execute them
smoothly and
accurately), this is a
very special week.
That’s right, you can
rethink your move to
Japan, because
PlayStation 2 is now
available in the US.

I know what you
are thinking: how
could anyone possibly
make a gaming
system that kicks any
more ass then the
original PlayStation?
The answer: easily.
The new PlayStation
does indeed kick
much more ass. You
can even play DVDs
and your old
PlayStation games on
it And, unlike the X-
Box, it doesn’t have a
stupid name or
conjure up strung,
disturbing images of
Bill Gates in a leather
jacket.

i know what you
are thinking now:
how the heck (an I
come to possess one
of these PlayStations
and, is it possible to
inject it directly into
my bloodstream?
Well, unfortunately,
right now itis pretty
hard to get a hold of
one. Doing so
involves scraping up
$299 and, more
dirriculty, wrestling
with hoards of pale,
rabid 12-year-old
boys at Wal-Mait who
only leave their living
rooms for special
occasions such as the
release of the next
Dune or using the
bathroom. These boys
know the Tekken
moves too, so watch
out.

If you do actually
get you hands on a
unit, you will
probably have to pay
ror it. No, you can’t
put it on your Forum
account,

50 I don't know
about you, but I am
pretty much not
going to get a
PlayStation 2 unless
one happens to fall
out of the sky. And
even if one did fall
out of the sky, I
would still not have a
TV.

If you want to
tommiserate with me
on this issue, I’ll be
in my room crying
and playing Snood.
