My own title beyond that of a pro-
fessor is “Chairman of the faculty '
and the only authority or responsib -
ity this Carries is to preside at facul—
ty meetings in the absence of the
president. Thank you,

Henry s. Conard.

Duke Appoints V
Class Captains

April 14 Selected as Date
for Home Track Meet

Class captains for the annual boine
track meet, to be held on the after-
noon of April 14, were named today
by Les Duke, track Coach.

Two men were chosen to captain
each team; seniors, Joseph Pheiffei-
and Albert Rose, juniors, Wesley
Clark and Arnold Dickinson, sopho-
mores, Robert Bair and Don Barnes,
freshmen, Robert Arcus and Robert
Work.

Advance figures givc the junior
class the advantage in the meet.
especially since the class, under the
sophomore banner, last year walked
away with the honors, taking or
points, to at for the class of '33, 25
for the present sophomores, and i.
for the class of '34, To what extent
the absence of last year's senior
class and the coming of the freshman
group will alter the standings re-
mains to be seen.

“Any person winning five points or
more will be entitled to an intramu-
rar medal,” Duke stated. No particie
pant will be allowed to enter more
than three events, relays included,
Each runner will also be limited to
one distance event, the distance
events including those runs of a
quarter mile and longer.

It is probable that two meet re—
cords will be hroken. Pheiffer has
run the mile this year in less than the
time of 4:28.21 set by Mike Pilbrow,
and the mile relay mark will be in
danger when the junior and sopho-
more teams go into action.

Louise Willard will visit Doris and
Ruth Crabb at Mason City, Esther
