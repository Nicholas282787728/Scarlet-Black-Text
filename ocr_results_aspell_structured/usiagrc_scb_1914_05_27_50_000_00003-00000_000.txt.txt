YALE ENDUWS TWG HGSPITALS

As we consider the progress or our
Griiinell in China. it is interesting to
note the work or a similar nature
conducted by others oi our higher in-
sctltntiohs.

Thus iar Yale's held is the most ex:
tensire. 1n Chang-Shh, in the south
ern pat-t ot China, they hate establish
ed two large schools, a hospital, and a
college. Tire school buildings and
hospitals are built in the newest
American style anti are equipped with
Ihe latest appliances. Fourteen Yale
men have charge oi the station. and
Yale graduates and undergraduates en-
tirely Suppol't AC.

Oberlin has established tiio schools.
one tor lower grades, the other for
advanced worn, at Shansi, china.
These sdiools have a iaculty oi thirty-
rtre per-sons. The budget tor the sup-
port or these schools, is raised by the
students, who are showing great inter-
est in the worit.

Princeton has ﬁie workers in charge
oi a ‘1. ii, 0. A. at Pettin, China, and a
great deal oi excellent niorlt is heihg
done among the young men at the
Chinese capital. JohnWsnauraher has
presented them with a $60,000 hnild~
mg.

Both Harvard and the University at
Pellllsilvttllia hare estahlished hospi-
tals and medical schools in China.
Tire latter has built anti equipped a
hire modern hospital at Carrion, at a
cast oi $11,000. This hospital worlt
is closely allied to educational Wul‘k.
Native doctors are greaih demanded
anti are trained there. The ﬁeltl or a
pirrsician in China is very large, in<
ciutiing irom one to two nriliiorrs or
people, with the medical woi-
associated the spiritual iiort.
