Do you think that abuse of drugs and alcohol is
the symptom of a larger disease, rather than the

Shifting gears to housing. In my time here,
there’s been a very deﬁnite shift from off-cam-
pus housing to can-campus housing, shutting
down most college-owned off-campus houses,
for example. What is the rationale behind this,
given that living on campus is more expensive,
not as conducive to the life-styles that people

might otherwise lead and per-

mits less autonomy?

Many years ago we did a housing
