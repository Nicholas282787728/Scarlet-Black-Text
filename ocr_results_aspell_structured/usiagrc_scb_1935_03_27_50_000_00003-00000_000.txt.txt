Mackie Sue Coats, in her articles in
the current MALTEASER makes quite
a disgraceful performance out of a
picnic; but no afraid that from the
gentleman's point of view a picnic is
concerned less with the young man’s
spring fancy that it is with having an
occasional rest from all the endless
walking couples do in the evening.

Women always seem to conceive of-

men as having a onc.track rnind fixed
on a definite goaliwhich is, of course,
themselves.

Coats glibly assumes to be man’s nee.

IER LEAVES

.MILDEST SMOKE

I give you the mildest smoke, the best-l

tasting smoke. I do not irritate your throat.

You‘ wonder what makes me different.

For one thing, it’s center leaves. I spurn

the little, sticky, top leavés . . . so bitter to

the taste. I scorn the coarse bottom leaves,

so harsh and ulmppctizilig. I am careful

of your friendship, for I am made of only

the mild, fragrant, expensive center leaves.
