The crirdint; kids of the Grinncll
College football team were up to their
old nicks last week. giving their coach
ing staff a few more grey hails—and
another close victory

Aided by Nate Wincinger's ‘05
ground attack, quarterback Sean Pfals
zer’s ‘07 passing game, and some timely
defensive and special
reams impacr plays,
the Pioneers were

“We certainly
have a knack for win-

said Wineinger, who
rushed for 122 yards and two touchs
downs on 33 carries. The halfback got
Grinnell on the scoreboard ﬁrst in the
second quarter, a quarter that also fea-
turcd touchdown receptions by Matt
Testers ‘05 and Trey Ransy ‘05. Cars
loll also posted three touchdowns in
the ﬁrst half, and both teams went into
halftime with 21 points on rhe scorer
board.

The third quarter was owned by
the defenses, as no points were scored
and both offenses were srruggliag.

made oilcnslvc adjustments, howevel,
and the fourth quarter opened with
some scaring.

“In the middle of the second

coach Greg Wallace.
“It is great to see both

Carroll scored first

in the final quarter, as

Adam Fletcher caught a 54»yard pass
from quarterback Chris Rogers. Grins
nell answered soon after, as Wineinger
found the end zone from three ynrds
our. The score was knotted at 28, and
again the defenses took over. Both
teams traded offensive possessions for
much of the quarter, until Pioneer se—
nior linebacker Charles Blake sniffed
out an errant screen pass from Rogr
ers and picked the ball out of the air
with just 3:36 remaining in the game.
The interception, which gave Grinnell
the ball at Carroll's 32*yard line, set

up a ﬁeld goal chalice the kicker Bud
lsaumgarmer- ‘07 with 2-15 to play.

“1 love heing pm in a posuion to
help my team wrn a ball game,“ said
Baumgaitnei,“so I felt really good go-

The kick was true, making rhc score
31728. The 327yard field goal turned
out to be the gamerwinner, giving the
Pioneer’s their first road win of the sea-
son, and placing them at 54 overall,
and 4—4 in ch play

“It was grear to get our first win on
the road this season,"said Wallace. “It is
always a hurdle to win on the load in this
conference with the length ofthe trips."

Grinnell will have to endure anorhs
er hurdle and another trip this week, as
they head to Beloit, Wise. to take on
Belort College for the final game ofthe
season.A victory will give Grinnell only
their third winning season since the
l960sﬁlnd the first since 1993#and
the players and coaches know how im~
portant awin would be to rhe program.
Giinnell has won three of its last four
games, and seems to have found some
momentum to carry them into another
road game on Saturday.

“Beloit is a very big and physical
ream, on both offense and defense,"
said Wallace. “We will need to play ere
tremely well up front to be successful.
we don’t plan to change our game plan
this week. Balance is the key,"

The Gn'unell College VOLLEYBALL team wrapped up their
season last weekend with an eighthsplace ﬁnish at the Midwest
Conference Championships, hosted by Illinois College.

The women entered the conference tournament seeded ninth,
but knocked off eighth-seeded Carroll in the ﬁrst round (30-27,
37-35, 26-30, 24-30, 17-15) Senior BETSEY BLANCHE Contrib-
uted seven kills and seven blocks while LARA JANSON '05 added
50 assists. Sophomores LESLIE TURNER, JESSICA HODGMAN
and TAMRAH COLLINS combined for 46 kills for the Pioneers.

Consecutive losses to Ripon and Illinois College ended the
Pioneer's season. The women ﬁnished 6-29 (2‘10 in MWC play)
after a grueling schedule which included tournaments in Wis—
cousin, Illinois, Iowa and Oklahoma.

"We had a really tough schedule," said KATE THOMAS '05,
”we played some Division 1 teams and we were doing a lot of
traveling The way we played at the beginning and the end of
the season was completely different and it‘s a shame that it’s
not reﬂected in our record" In the first round of the Division
III National Tournament for WOMEN'S SOCCER, the Pioneers met
Macalester, the only team to manage three goals against Grin-
nell this season The Scots did it again, winning 3—1 Wednesday
afternoon at Varsity Performance Field on a hat trick by Annie
