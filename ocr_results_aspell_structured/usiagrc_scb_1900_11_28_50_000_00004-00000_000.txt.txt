lnnes and His Band.

All persons who enjoyed the
concert given here two years ago
by Inllcs and his band will with
out doubt be pleased to welcome
him again on the evening of Dec.
7th. Since his appearance here,
Inncs' successes have been as
great as ever, He played during
the entire ﬁve weeks of the St.
Louis exposition, played at the
expositions at Pittsburp and Phil-
atlelphia, and spent both
mers in playing to thousands of
people at Atlantic City, one of
the largest summer resorts on the
Atlantic coast. On his concert
trips he gives two concerts daily;
his present trip embracing two
concerts in Illinois and fourteen
in iowa. The band is composed
of 56 pieces with which are 6
grand opera singers who give a
grand opera eveiy evening. The
opera is not given in costume,
In conducting, innes never uses a
scorer His new march “Prince
Charming” is said to be even
more popular than “Love is
King. lunes was highly pleased
with the reception given him two
years ago and it is to he hoped
that the audience which greets
him on his return will be even
more appreciative, both in numr

bers and enthusiasm.

Football Picture.

The tootball squad of 47 men-ls
hers had their pictures taken in
Child’sGallcrylastSatllrdny after
noon. ltisrcmarkably clear cut
and distinct tor such a large group,
Mr. Child certainly did good work
and the team is to be congratulat-
ed. The pictures are 9x7 and are
sold at 50 cents each. It is
hoped a large number will be state
lered ill Grinncll, that this year’s
record of football enthusiasm nlay
be perpetuated.

as;

Simpson Football standing.

The Des Moines papers have
been discussing at some length
the place Simpson should occupy
among the colleges of the state.
Simpson claims that having given
Iowa at big scare; tied Arnes ore,
and been dcteated by Drake by a
score ot only or, that her posir
lion could only be determined by
a game with Grinncll. Tlle fact
that both Grinncll and Drake cle-
feated Ames whom Simpson tied
adds to the difﬁculty. Simpson
is anxious for agame with Grin-
nell but the latter’s schedule is
fllII and it is not plobable that
such a game will be played.

“The board of control has
unanimously voted to play no
postseason game. The hoard
desires to make no statement in
regard to its reasons tor the re
fusal.” Professor Smith of the
board of control gave out this
statement last Saturday after
noon. thtt/a-Repwtcr.
