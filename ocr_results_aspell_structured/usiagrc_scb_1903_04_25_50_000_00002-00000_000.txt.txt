Grinnell, Iowa, Saturday, April 25, mag

@hiturtal

Econgratulate the athletic
QB union management at the
State University on its success in
raising the athletic debt. And
we congratulate the University on
the spirit shown by friends and
students generously contributing.
Grinnell knows the troubles that
Come with such a debt and the
feeling of relief that results from
its payment. The energetic way
in which the matter was taken up
and the general interest taken by
the students ought to be a sign of
good support to spring athletics
at the University. Any student
body will support a’winning team
but when individuals have to go
into their pockets to pay old
debts and do it willingly and
cheerfully, there is evidence of a
healthier and more permanent

loyalty to college interests.
