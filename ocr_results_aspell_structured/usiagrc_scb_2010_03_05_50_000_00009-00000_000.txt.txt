Las Fajitas opens up downtown

BYJAI GARG

Ifyou’re older than a ﬁrstryear, while taking a stroll through
downtown Grinnell, it is easy to feel somewhat out of place,
Jirnbo‘s and Grinnell Coffee Company are gone and where once
stood the entrance to Grinriell Hhemorks is Grinnell’s newest
Mexican restaurant—Las Fajitas.

Despite the suddenexplosion ofsimilarly themed restaurants,
Las Fajitas stands in a league ofits own. Walking inside, one is
greeted with a spacious restaurant in a space only prolific knitters
and crafters had previously occupied. The stair is friendly, the
decor is wonderful and the environment is comfortable.

However, it is the food that truly separates Las Fajitas from
its competitors. Creating a twist on a classic favorite, all meals
are accompanied with not only the usual combination of chips
and salsa but also a bowl of refried beans.

"[What separates us] is the waiter service, the beans with the
salsa and chips and the larger selection ofseafood on the menu,"
said Luz Niﬁo, who started this business with her husband.

Nino and her husband moved to Grinnell in 2000, after time
spent in Minnesota and Northern Iowa. Since moving here they
always had aspirations of opening a restaurant.

"My husband has always dreamed of having a restaurant,"
Nine said. “He loves Grinneu and downtown is a great spot."

Aside from the quite pleasant surprise of beans, the menu
is full of unique and adequately priced choices. While the food
took longer than at other similar restaurants, it was well worth
the wait The Grande Burrito is aptly named and, unlike at many
other places, is not overly smothered in cheese. The fajitas were
delicious due to them being doused in lime and cilantro sauce.
The chef’s special, like most of the dishes, came with ample
amounts of food and easily brought smiles to our three openr
mouthed faces.

Of course, like any new restaurant, Las Fajitas does have
some drawbacks, Going through the menu, the lack of margari-
tas is quite evident. Because of delays, the restaurant has yet to
get a liquor license.

“A lot of college students have been here, but a lot of people
say daily that they like alcohol," Nino said. “Bur we are getting a
license soon, hopefully within the month."

While Grinnellians now have a myriad of options to choose
from when going out for their favorite Mexican delicacy, Nino
is hopeful that the uniqueness of Las Fajitas will win them over.

"Its kind of like playing Russian Roulette,youjust give it a try
and see,"Nit"io said. “It is going well, we love to serve the come
munity and he as friendly as we can be."

New Orleans flair from an unlikely location

BYJORDAN SCHEIBEL

In the shadow of Iowa City to the east, sitting between
the popular tourist destinations of the Amana Colonies to
the west and Kalona, an Amish and Mennonite enclave, to
the south, Oxford does not appear to be a destination for
many people.

Driving into town on a Saturday night, the single main
street lined with buildings on both sides appeared to he
closed down, save for the local bar and the only sit-down
restaurant in Oxford, the Augusta Restaurant.

While the town may be best known for The Oxford
Project—a book of stories and photo
graphs of 100 oxford residents (1/7 of
the current population of the town) tak-
en 20 years apart, by Oxford native Peter
Feldstein~it was Augusta that brought
us to Oxford on this particular night.

Augusta was at first hard to find,
since its sign is placed on a side street
wall facing away from the interstate to
the south. looking north up the main
street toward Route 6. If this is indica-
tive of Augusta's atrliudeiin contrast to the tourist hun-
gry Amana colonies and Kalona, which make good use of
signs on the nearby interstate—it's hard to tell.

I’ve ever had.”

Entering the restaurant through the ring of curtains
that protect the interior from cold drafts as people enter
and leave, you might think that you have walked into a
trendy restaurant in downtown Iowa City. The room was
small but high ceilinged, covered in wood paneling, dimly
lit and crowded with wellrdressed middle age diners. We
were ushered to the bar and then quickly seated.

Augusta is 2 Cajun restaurant, coeowned and operatr
ed by Jeri and Ben Halpetin, who were driven from New
Orleans in 2005 by Hurricane Katrina. They came to Ox-
ford via Chicago, opening Augusta in this unlikely place

in 2008, Unlike places with more dubious

Street—Augusta does not try to overwhelm
you with its Big Easy connection

The name comes from the street it sits on
in Oxford, spelled with the “T" replaced by
a traditional ﬂeurrderlis symbol. Jazz from
New orleans is played softly over speakers
in the restaurant. Some Mardi Gras beads
adorn the light fixtures along the wall. Art
and photographs from local artists and town
history decorate the walls. What Augusta does try to do is
serve all fresh, homemade food, down to the salad dressr
ing, mayonnaise and pickles, from as many local sources as

possible.

It's not cheap, but Augusta was still awarded the Best
Affordable Meal by the Iowa Source in 2009— a testament
to the fact that the quality is equal to the price. Augusta has
also won an award for the Best Breaded Pork Tenderloins
from whom else but the Iowa Pork Producers Association.

We ordered sauteed oyster mushrooms as a split entrée,
salads and four sides—sweet potato chips, sugar carrots,
stewed greens and fried grit cake. The fried grit cake, the
least familiar of the four, in particular was very good, as
were the sweet potato chips.

The mushrooms were not only the most delicious mushr
rooms we’ve ever tasted but one of the best foods I’ve ever
had. The only problem was that there were so few to eat,
We ﬁnished dinner with chocolate filled heignets, cherry
bread pudding and chicory coffee,which is made ofchicory
root and tastes mostly like coffee.

All the food was very memorable and the whole atr
mosphere of the restaurant—which included frve Happy
Birthday songs while we were there—was congenial and
relaxed. It is easy to understand why people are ﬂocking
to Oxford to visit Augustaia Cajun restaurant that has
found a niche in a small Midwestern town.
