Chile had to be destroyed. Here,
in our own hemisphere, was a na-
tion that was discovering what free-
dom really meant. The whole world
was watching the Chilean people and
they were beginning to succeed.

Render: Recognize
Jewish Holidays

To the Editors:

I am not at all pleased by the ace
tions of the Grinnell College Ad-
ministration towards the past Jew-
ish Holy Holidays. It seems to me
that more respect should be shown
towards these very important three
days of the Jewish calendar. I don't
think it was very proper to schedule
a Parents Program for the weekend
of Yom Kippur, nor do I think it
proper to schedule Classes on the
first day of the Jewish New Year.
There is a calendar of these dates
in the future in my possession that
extends until 1995 that I would most
graciously offer it to anyone in the
scheduling department or the
Administration for their use. i sin
cerely hopethatjudgementandplan—
ning are not taken for granted in the
future,

Dunn Ouellions
Wylie's Note

To the Editors:

Whether or not Mr. John Wylie
(I include his first name to avoid
any possible confusion with mem—
bers of the faculty) exercised sound
editorial policy in his treatment
of Mr. Frost's letter last week can
be easily determined by his honest
answer to this question: Would he
have done the same if Mr. Frosthad
expressed a different viewpoint?

Julie Dunn
Ed. note--‘[es. The point of the ed-
itor’s note was simply that Mr. Fr-
ost demonstrated considerable
carelessness in his letter by, if
nothing else, misspelling a name
located within one inch of the edi-
torial with which he took issue.
That same carelessness would have
been evident had his letter offered
100% support of the editorial posi-
tion.

Frosl: Apologizes

To the Editors:

It is with deep humility that I
here publicly apologize to Asso»
ciate Professor James Wyly lur
statements which were printed in
last week’s S it B. i realize that
the confusion of names was pro-
bably a grave insult to Prolessor
Wyly. l was, of course, referring
to S it B editor John Wylie. The
latter Wylie was inconsistent in his
corrections of my letter, changing
paragraphing, yet leaving spelling
untouched, unless he did not read
the first sentence of the letter in
which I referred to him as the
author of the previous week's edi-
torial. Evidently, Mr. Wylie's ex—
alted ”files” carry information on
members of the College Communi»
ty, yet do not even record the ed-
itorship of the S o B.

i am sure many people know and
respect Professor Wyly as I do.
For those who do know Editor Wy-
lie, he is the S 5t E editor who
placed his own picture on the front

spouting off about freedom and de»
mocracy. ‘

When the people of Chile no longer
listened but began to move towards
true freedom and democracy for
individuals, While they built social-
ism on the national level, it was too
much for the rich liberals and con-
servatives alike. They used their
freedom to declare war on the All»
ende government and the people,

It began with an economic Cam-
paign and is ending in the reign
of terror and blood that we are
witnessing today in Chile,

One may ask, "Can there be free-
dom for both the oppressed and the
oppressors'!” .

The answer of the Chilean bour-
geoisie Can be heard in the roar
of bombs and cannonfire that is shat»
tering Santiago.

GRINNELL LOCAL
SOCIALIST PARTY, USA

by Toni Knapp

Since this column is being read
(or maybe not, I'm a realist) by a
largely Eastern audience, (east of
the Miss, of Course) remarks about
politics in Iowa should be prefaced
by a note on the climate in which
they exist. Basically, the Midwest
in general, and lowa in particular,
have cleaner styles of political be»
havior than does the East. Where-
as a scandal in the East must in—
volve at least a U.S. Senator and be
worth at least a million dollars
with a little sex thrown in to make
the papers, in lowa 'state re-
presentative accepting twenty bucks
in drinks from a lobbyist not only
makes page one, but the lead editors
ial as well. Similarly no large indus-
tires or labor organizations cloud
state politics.

With that glowing introduction (for
a small lee, rd be happy to give
rights to theluwa Commerce people)
we can get down to business. The
announcement by Harold Hughes
threw the entire state situation into
chaos. Last week's announcement
by Gov, Ray that he would not seek
the Senate seat and perhaps (50%)
not the governors seat compounded
the confusion, That leaves one Sens
ate seat, probably two House seats,
maybe the governorship, and Lieu-
tenant governorship, and much ol
the Iowa house open.

Congressman Culver has announv
ced for the seat held by Hughes.
Thus far he is the only Democrat
to have done so. AlthoughCongress»
man Smith and Nick Johnson were
mentioned as possible candidates, it

is a good bet that the Democrats
will let Culver have a clear run.

ray of Ames. In this writer’s
opinion, the latter would be the most
attractive candidate. Nevertheless,
all three are little known outside of
the State House or their own dis-
tricts. Should any of them gain
recognition with the voters. it will
be a close Senate race.

Should Ray decide to run for
governor again, the chair is all but
his. I: he retires, however, another
tight race could develop. Art Neu.
now Lieutenant Governor would a1~
most surely enter the race. For the
Democrats, Bill Gannon (of horses
hack fame) is Considered the likely
ticket-header. These two were opps
onents in the 1972 Lieutenanlgovere
nor’s race, with Neu winning by a
small margin. Without Ray at the top
of the ticket, a virtual toss»up is
assured.

In the First District (into which
Grinnell was stuck) Ed Mezvinsky
will most likely be an unbeatable

candidate. With a 100% voting re—
cord, and weak Republican opposi-
tion, he will have little trouble.

At the moment, Culver's district
has few candidates. This Eastern
lowa political division is heavily
Democratic, and should provide lit—
tle difficulty for any Democrat who
can make it through the primary.

In the third district, “venerable”
H.R. Gross is once again making
signs that he will step down in favor
of a handvpicked aide. Ed Gilmour
provided this writer with the names
of several Democrats interested in
the seat. They include Jim Scaine of
UNI, Steve Rapt ol the lowa House,
and Ron Masters, an active party
member from the area. Neverthe—
less, whatever Republican wins the
primary Should have an edge in that
normally Republican district.

Wiley Mayne, William Scherie,
and Neal Smith all look like they
have safe seats should they decide
to run for another term. All are
in districts that are consid red
fairly secure, ‘ " ’

A wild card has been added to this
list, in the form of Nick Johnson,
formerly of the FCC. it is conceive
able that he could run for Congress
in any of the six districts, or run
for Senator. All he has to dois cone
vince the people of that area that
he can represent them despite the
fact that he has been serving in
Washington with an agency that
has little to do with Iowa, or the
concerns of the people of Iowa.
At present. I am told that it is
most likely that he would run in

Dead Comes Alive in New Album

by Rick rnust

“Grateful Dead Records” will be
come a reality on October i5, 1973
when they will release Wake of the
Flood, the Grateful Dead’s ilrst
studio album in almost three years.

ippi Hali»Step Uptown Toodeloo,”
"Row Jimmy," “Stella Blue,"
“Eyes of the World,” are songs
written by Jerry Garcia and Robert
Hunter along with "Weather Report
Suite Prelude," written by Bob Weir.

Now that the Dead are free fromthe. Several of the tunes have been heard

web of Warner Brothers with their
summer release of The History of
the Grateful Dead Vol. 1 (Bear’s
Choice), they are free to realize
their dream of an independent re~
cord company.

The company is located in San
Rafael, California and will be ins
dependent of any major recording
company except for foreign distri-
bution handled by Atlantic Records.
Their idea is to “let the feeling
that goes into music now into every
step or making the record."

If the two cuts “Let Me Sing Your
Blues Away" and “Here Comes
Sunshine" are indicative of the rest
of the album, they’re idea should he
a resounding success. People who
attended last year's Des Moines
Dead concert will remember “Here
Comes Sunshine” and how it literally
brought the sun back out of the cl-
ouds.

Keith Godchaux debuts his writing
talents on "Let Me Sing YourBlues
Away.” This song displays one of
the most soulful tenor saxes this
side of Junior Walker, Unfortunate-
ly,'lhe man who plays is unknown
at this point.

The rest of the album “Mississ-

at Dead concerts over the last year.
The independent recording concern
is nothing new in recordingcircles,

‘Z’Et‘fllb been

however for the first time this idea
will be totally actualized for a
major recording group. Rolling St~
ones Records is nothing more than
a division of Atlantic Records. A
few jazz musician associationshave
recorded purely independently, but
their sales can probably be counted
in the hundreds.

A step like this was only logical

time refining their sound according
to their own specifications. All ex-
