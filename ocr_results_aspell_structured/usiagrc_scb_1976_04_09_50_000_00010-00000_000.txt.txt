The baseball Pioneers dropped
two games to Goa College last
Saturday, sea and 10-3, as they
opened the Iowa portion of their
schedule. Tomorrow Cornell
College comes to Grinnell for a
Conference doubleheader begin-
ning at 1 pm, The Coe games,
while not wins, were a good
preparation tor Cornell as the two
teams play a similar brand oi
baseball.

Coach John Plilsch's troops
managed to pick a raw, windy day
to play Cue, the only such day of
the week, Junior Paul Delaney
started the first game and pitched
the distance, giving up [our earned
runs, "I thought Delaney pitched
well,” said Pfilsch. “Un-
fortunately, he threw two bad
pitches which resulted in
homeruns,”

The Pioneers jumped on Cno’s
Starting pitcher for two runs in the
first inning as Craig Zippe led off
with a single, was sacrificed to
second by Tom Goetz, and was
joined on the basepaths by the
walking Delaney, After it wild
pitch advanced the runners, John
Haigh smgled home lhe two men.
in the third inning, Haigh again
singled Itome zippe to account tor
all lhrcc runs,

Cue closed the gap to 3.2 with
stttglelalliesinthcihird and tourth
innings and then look a 4-3 lead in
the lillh on a twosl‘lln hcmerun. An
unearned run in lhesixth gave Coe
the final margin ol i-3.

Grinnell uollecled eight hlls In
the game to the Kchawks‘nine.
“Delelisivc play was good and
hitting “as fair." said Piitsch.

In the second Hallie Gl'innell
again iiiniped oil to a lead with
three runs in the second inning.
Paul Crane doubled and Charlie
Gngel walked. Bob Meyer then hit
into a llelder‘s Choice. forcing
Crane at lhird. Mark Brooks
singled homc Gogol and Zippe
doubled home Meyer and Brooks
fur a Kettlead. Then the Fool fell in!

Lorne Robinson started the
second game on lhc mound and got
rocked (or seven runs in the bottom
hall at the second inning as Coe
unlimbercd their lumber. Included
in Coe’s outburst were three
consecutive triples. a baseball
rarity. Charlie Gogol was called in

t

O

lrom right lield to put out the tire’S

and was successful, thanks to an
lnning~ending third to first double
play executed by Haigh.

in the third inning, Cogel gave
up three runs and, with two out and
the bases loaded, Todd Kuccra
came on to get the ﬁrst man he
faced to ground the ﬁrst pitch he
threw right back to him {or an easy
out. Kucera iinished the game
pitching three and one-third
scoreless innings. Good defensive
plays aided Kucera considerably,
especially several sparkling plays
by left fielder Goetz and second
hasernen Meyer. Gogel also earned
Plitsch’s praise for his center lield
play in the first game.

The Pioneers were held to just
six hits in the second game, For the
day Zippe collected tour hits in
eight at bats. and Brookes, Crane.
Delaney. and Haigh each had two
apiece.

Tomorrow's games with Cornell
are key ones tor two reasons.
Cornell is the Pioneels’ only con-
ference opponent, the two teams
battling lc represent lows in lhe
Midwest Centerence iourne Also
Crinnell has the home advantage
and the opportunity to be two up on
the Rams alter the day's activities.
