“Verification ct recent experiments

Professor Conard was commenting
on a report that three French scient-
ists have located an “immobile organ-
ism" in a plant tumor which was pro-
duced by inoculating a common gel-an.

fected human tissue

“There is a striking sirnilar’

Tumor Sh‘i’lllils Sent Out

"Flirther experiments revealed that
when this organism becomes estahlish.
ed in a plant cell, the cell immediately
begins to multiply. As the growth
reaches full size tumor strands are
sent out, which start new centers of
multiplication. Often those connected
tumors reach such numbers that the
plant is dwarfed or crippled and in
some instances even killed.

“Likewise in human cancer, there
is an enormous multiplication of cer-
tain tissues of the animal which by
continued growth crush and disorgane
ize the surrounding tissues. Here
also secondary growths are termed

"This similarity in the growth and

to believe that a study of the former
might reveal the key to unlock the

‘ “Thus tar all attempts to isolate a
cancer germ in either humans or anir
