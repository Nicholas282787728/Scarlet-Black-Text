NEBRASKA WINS GAME.

Grinncll Plays piuckily, nut is Delenmd
—Neurasks Given u Star: in
First Hail.

Though playing a gritty, stubborn
game that threatened to give Nobras»
ka onlya slender margin or victory,

Iowa. College linally proved another
victim to Cole’s corniluskers in the
game at Lincoln inst Saturday.

After holding‘Nebraska to a. single
touchdown, and it a decidedly lluky
one, superior weight and training in
the end proved too much for the
nervy Iowans, and the Cornhuskers
piled upa total of ﬁve touchdowns,
{our of them coming in the ﬁnal half.
They were saved [ram 3. shut out
however, and made the ﬁrst score of
the year against Nebraska. Quarter
back Brundage kicking a dillicult
goal from tlle ﬁeld late in the contest
scoring four points let his team. The
score was 30 to -l>.

Facing a team better pointed for
the contest than its former opponents
had been, Nebraska during the ﬁrst
half failed signally in its attempts to
gain ground by old time tactics. Tile
lighter Grinnell men were themselves
out ﬁghting back the grinding, llnreA
lenting line attacks of the Cornhuskr
els, and in the Second half the same
plays which were rolled by them
earlier in the game were too much lol-
the hawkeyes, but until they were
welluigh exhausted they struggled
with a courage that won the admirer
tion of the Nebraska motel-s

Flanagan and McCarty at ends,
Brundage at quarter. Hair and Rita»
master at the halves. and Turner at
full did heady work for Grinnell.
Grinnell’s Weak places were at the
two tackles, through which the most
of Nebraska‘s gains in the second half
were made.

RESERVES WIN FAST GAME.

Marshalllown High Sci-moi Defealqd In
interesting Contest.

in a game characterized by wrang-
ling and loose play rather than by any
brilliant football, the college Second
team deioated Marshallmwn High
School Saturday afternoon at Ward
ﬁeld byasnore oi ii to 0. The Reserves
outweighed the High School lads and,
as individuals. outplayed them, but
team work and conﬁdence in each
color were sadly lacking. sninstrom
at halland Hammond and Massach-
run at ends starred for the Reserves.
For the High School Kirk gained the
more consistently on line punches,
while the whole team played together
much better than did the Reserves.

Grinnell scored her two touchdowns
in the ﬁrst half. one being credited to
Clark and the other to Shinstrol‘n.
Carter kicked tho i: goal, while
sninstrorn missed the second narrowly.
At the beginning of the second half
several substitutes were put in and
Grinnell was never near enough to
Marsllallwwn’s goal to be dangerous
except when Carter tailed in an air
tempt at a ﬁeld goal mm the twenty-
yard line. During the second nah
Beers of the Reserves sustained inju-
ries severe enough to keep him out oi
the game the remainder at tho year.

The same teams will meet at Mars
shalltawn next Saturday and a close

game may be expected.
