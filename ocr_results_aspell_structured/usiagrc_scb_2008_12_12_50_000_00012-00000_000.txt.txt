Time to use ‘your words

With threats from the diminishing ccori-
omy, Sheree Andrews being forced out by the
administration, and changes being made to
student staff, Grinnellians have grounds for
concern. But rather than complaining on
[plans], fears about the changing state of the
College should be voiced to those who actu-
ally have the power to change things—the
administration.

The SGA—sponsored campus discussion
on Thursday was a great way to open up the
lines ofcominunicat'ion between students and
ildn-iinistratotsY but Grinncll'lans shouldn‘t let
the conversation concerning the direction or
the college end with this open forum. .

Houston Doughai'ty has voiced his inter-
est in listening to students‘ grievances, but
when we limit our complaints to the realm of
cyberspace, our voices can't be heard.

The conclusion of this semester marks a
unique time to voice concerns about the state
of the College. If you want to see changcs
made next semester, share your voice in a con-
structive way and email Dougharty, Greene,or
Osgood, set up a meeting, and talk to them.

Student Adviser change

Student Advisers (SAs) serve an incred-
.ibly important role for student life. They
throw study breaks helping you get to know

your neighbors, give you food while you're
going crazy during ﬁnals week, and help you
keep your head above the toilet when your
postef‘innls celebrations get ‘
a little out of hand
But as certain changes
in administrators have cape
tivated the campus discus—
sion on Student Affairs this
past week, changes to the
position or 5A5 have re-
cently been suggested (see the story on page
3). While it is unclear exactly what will be ime
plcmcntcd, it appears that the RLCs and Sue
dent Affairs are intent on instituting revisions
to the role SAs that could be damaging to the
role they cut-

administration must look to both current and
former stair members for guidance before any
structures are altered.

The fact that we designate
student staff members as SAs
rather than RAs is an impor-
tant distinction. Unlike most
schools. SAs do not receive
any salary or reduction in
room fees, and as a result, ey
do not have the res onsi 1i»
ties of being employed members o Student
Affairs. Because of this, SAs lack responsi-
bilitics such as policing their lloor for drink-
ing or lnventorying rooms and instead can fa»
cus their attention on the important role they
play in fostering self-governance in out dorm
commtrnin'es.

It is essential that the administration con-
sults with student staff and students at large
before any changes take place. But even this
is not enough; these discussions cannot origir
natc from only within the administration. It
is not okay for Lhc administration to create
these changes through discussions that do
not include students from the outset. Any
changes must arise from a dialogue between
both administration and students. Our stir
dent staff members have the hands on experie
cues and knowledge of what selrgovemance
means Lhrlt must be used to help shapewhat

‘tlie ﬁiture of the SAs will be.

Osgood on confidentiality policy

one or the hallmarks of u strong college
or university is having the integrity to honor
and protect conﬁdentiality among and about
its faculty, staff, and students in all matters in—
volving evaluative processes, particularly those
affecting individuals with family and close
friends in the community. Grinnell College
and representatives of the College are thus
appropriately consrmiued from commenting
upon any individuals employment or clauus
regarding an individuals employment record.
In all such matters, the College seeks to op-
ply high standards and to act fairly and even
geiiarously,

Sub-free housing is a real option

Last week, the Opinion section ofrhe SSE
published an article by Hugh Redford '10
called “Substance free housing, ugaiust selfe
gov," which was both divisive and irrational,
Redford fails (0 ackiiowlcdgc that substaucce
rice housing is perhaps thc greatest cmbodr
mcut orselr-govcmancc present on cnmpus.

Redford mentions that personal choice and
religious obligation me some ofthe main rea»
sons students opt for subrfree housing. How
ever, he then states that the legitimacy ofthcse
reasons becomes “a little bit murkier"when put
in the Context ofsclfegovcrnancc. Hc damn
that sclfegov * about making people deal
“with the sticky issue ofhuman interaction"—
in other words, forcing students to suffer un-
der the pretense ofovcrcomiiig diversity.

But, Redford clearly misses the distinct
differencc between interacting with the die
vcrsc Grinnell community and respecting
cach othcr’s dccismns. Sclfrgov is about cmr
bracing, not disregarding, the plurality of
student choice. To suggest, as Redlortl does,
that subefree housing inhibits studenrs‘ free
dom is to blatantly ignore ti students choose
subefree housing, Subefr rousing is not an
imposition, but in option, out that, according
to Looschcad RLC and As iit Director of
Residence Life Klin l’llndS“Bi'l\Sli, 83 of this
year's incoming students cliost; to make.

Redford's deﬁnition of selfrgovcrnance
twists self-gov's true purpose: to recognize in-
dividuality, to provide a comfortable living en-
vironment, and to encourage responsible and
constructive decisions. Selfegov is not about
pressuring people into conﬂict; instead. it is
about resolving conflict.

Next time, Hugh, please stop and think for
a moment before you pick up your pen.

SGA appreciates students’ voice

We would like to than}; the 300+ indnudw
uls that were present at last night's commuuity
discussion. We arc extremely happy that all dife
fcrcur roles at Grinncll were represented: stu-
dcnrs, alums, faculty, start, and administration.
The variety orpcuplc that attended shows that
passion {oi the Grinnell community extends
across all different constituencies ofGriniicll.

We feel that last night opened a much
uecded duloguc that must he contiuucd
throughout the year. At the discussion, there
was a noticed call for increased dialogue. Look-
iug towards next semester, we will improve the
cunent state or communication by holding
Filesidc Chats where the entire Griiiiicll COI‘i‘i’
muuiry can continue to openly discuss issues
of concern. both new and old, Remcmbcr: wc
arc available through Joint Board, Hall Coune
cil, personal .ucctiugs, Cenmil, and office hours.
We encourage you to utilize rhcsc routes of
interaction.

Ultimately, we hope that future discussion
will focus on what can be done to improve the
concerns affccting Grinnelliaiis. If you have
any comments or questions with regard to the
events oi‘this wcclt and [he meeting last night,
plcasc coumct us at [sgni].

End vicious cycle, fix self-gov

At yesterday's ioium, we saw the express
sion of student frustrations that havc becn
building for u long time. students, or at least
sortie orus, rccl that they no lougcr possess the
sclr-dcrcruuuation that they descne from a
college that routs sclfrgovcmnncc us a way of
life. WlulC 1 can’t spcalc for anyonc but myself,
I believe that Gnnucllians me looking for a

real sense of cooperation which seems to have
been lost on this campus.

What we have instead in a place where sir
lent frustration is the norm. We're trapped in
a cycle in which administrators are unwilling
to give power to students because they don‘t
think that the students will use to the oppor
tuiiity And I think they might be right. But
irthat's the case, it is in part because our ere
pcrlenccs with administrators on this campus
suggest that we won't be heard as peers, but as
a constituency that must be placated. There’s
enough blame to be passed around to every
one

Administrators need to show the student
body that they are ready to communicate sine
ccrcly and to iucludc students, not just our
SGAhcads, in real decision—making. And stu-
dents must show administrators that they need
to be heard and are ready to be included. lfwc

Alumnus: Bravo on Policy Studies

1 am delighted to and that Policy Studies
has been added as a concentration thanks to
faculty approval (sacs Oct 31). I can’t think
of a better way of creariug student desire to
become part pants in the world of politics.
students will become committed to the study
of national and global environmental issues
and their concomitant economic impact.

Then participation in Grinnell Will furs
iiish the first nuts and bolts for “getting things
done", and will inspire them to become the
spark plugs who will make things happen in
thcir own communities, Those arc the sme
dcnrs who Will have a head start when they
run for elective uud appointive governmcural
office.

I was also happy to see the article on the
Gumball Challenge and iiiicrotiiiilitce. Why
was I not surprised‘ Bccilllsc this is thc Cole
