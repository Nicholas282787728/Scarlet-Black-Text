THE GRIN'NELL SCARLET AND BLACK

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 23, 1933

 

by Jack Kelsey

Altho Grinnell did not start the
1933 football season off with a huge
bang last night, prospects seem quite
bright for a banner season, The Pio-
neer stock will take a decidcd boost
this afternoon when the 5:15 choo-
choo puffs into the station, for both
Wesley Clark, veteran triple-threat
man, and Jim Bradley, flashy Indian
ballrtoter from last year's irosh
eleven, are expected to drop their
bags here, Both men have been ex-
pected for several days, and coaches
and girls from Harbor Springs are
not the only ones who have been
worrying about their return,

Usually one does not pay much
heed to the many threats given in
the {all by the Various college lum-
inaries who say they will not return.
but evidently Robert “Bo”, “RIM"
McMillin was quite sincere With his
statement. It has been rumored that
Bob will attend the State University
of Iowa, but at any rate Coach Watt
and all good Pioneer boosters are

going to miss having Mac putting the .’

ball into play from his pivot position
on the bail club. Despite his lack of
weight McMillin was an aggressive

center who made the opponents,

realize that there was more than an
ordinary man across from them. We
hope that Bob will return to Grinnell
someday and again take up his duties
shoving the ball into the backfield.

The swimming team seems to get
the biggest blow as far as losing its
members is concerned. Besides losing
Alan Roth and Bob Adams by
graduation, the tanksters will have
to do without the services of Clark
Elbert, star distance swimmer, and

Coach Elton Rosen, who was sue. -

c‘e‘ssful in turning out championship
teams during his brief stay at Grin-
nell. Rosco returned to Springfield,
Mass, and the latest word reported
him to be a life saver at one of the
eastern beaches. We imagine that
the pseudocclrowning among the
young debs was greatly increased at
this particular resort. Elbert is
planning to study law at Drake unis
versity this year. With this great loss
to the team and the additional finan-
cial burdens, there seems to be some
controversy regarding the team, Dave
Malbrough, crack short distance
fswimnier from last year's champion-
ship team will have charge of
swimming classes this year.

Gridder Sinks Ankle-Deep
to Discover Soft Spot
Above Pipeline

The discovery of a small area or
'soft earth on McEaclll‘on field Thurs
day afternoon, led to an investigar
tion. The investigation resulted in
some shovcl wielding, and the net
result was a trench 20 icet long and
about seven feet deep.

A water main leading to the stad-
ium on Ward field was the key to
the trouble. This main, which was
laid when the men's dormitories
were erected, some is years ago, was
badly rusted from its many years un-
derground In fact, several lengths of
the replaced piping resembled a col»

ander, that kitchen utensil of many
uses.

Before the trench was filled in,
about 20 feet of new piping was laid.
But even now the old main is not
what it uscd to he in prerwar days

Richard Phelps, end on the Grin-
nell football team, called attention to
the suspicious area overlying the
broken main during iootball practice
Thursday afternoon, after he had
slink ankle deep in the soft earth.

Coach Lester Watt remarked, “I
wish we would get a few more
breaks like that. It might make the
field a little softer,”
