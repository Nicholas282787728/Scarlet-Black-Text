AH! A SWIMMING POOL

We were leafing through the W.P.A.
Guide to law the other day, hoping to
learn something about this geographical ex«
pression, where, the Guide assures us with
quiet firmness, are to be found “kindly citi<
Zens, and considerable natural beauty.”

Grinllell, another geographical expression,
is duly discussed in Tour 14, and we learn
with the delight that statistics always arouse
in us that we are 126 m. from Illinois, that
our alt. is 1,023, and our pop. 4,949. We
half expected to find that the town boasted
a coll., but here the editors not only dis—
dained abbreviations but referred to us in
capital letters: GRINNELL COLLEGE,

It was a pleasure to see listed again all
the well known former students of Grill-
nell, Norman Hall, Harry Hopkins, Gardner
Cowles,/Ruth Snckow, and Gary Cooper
(1901- ). We always knew we were fa-
mous for our alumni, but we were a little
surprised to find out what else we are fa-
mous for.

After the Guide has retold all the histol‘ ,
it add . “0n the campus of 63 acres grow
large number of trees, both native and
foreign to the state. The college has a
SWIMMING POOL {open to the public in
the summer) and other recreational facili‘
ties." So we are to go down ill history, fa-
mous for a swimming pool (in capital let—
ters) and Gary Cooper (1901. ).

Well, the Gitidc was written for tourists,
and who shall say that the tourist driving
through on U. S. No. 6 on a hot July
afternoon will not stop off for an hour, use
the POOL (open to the public) to cool Off,
see Gary Cooper at a local movie, read the

HEAR ABOUT THE PUBLICATIONS PLAN!

As the week progresses, there is heard dis-
cussion on every side relative to the new
plan for a better publications set up on the
campus. One thing is outstanding in these
discussions. There is a great amount 01'
misinformatoll about the existing set-up
and a great deal of misinformation about
the proposed plan.

Friday morning in Chapel there will be
a general discussion on this plan with stu—
dent participation from the floor. This
chapel program Friday merits the full sup
port of the student body. Whether you are
for the plan or against it, whether you
know a lot about it or nothing at all, conic
to Chapel Friday morning, find out what
your fellow students are thinking and find
out just what this plan is all about.

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

WHAT ABOUT CHAPEL?

Gl'inllell chapel has been an integral part
of campus life for a good number of years.
The chapel program on this campus is one
of our traditions that does deserve to be
maintained.

Lately, the attendance at chapel hasn’t
been what it should be. When only about 50
to ’75 students out of a possible 800 show
up [or the daily chapel programs, something
is \\ ong, either with the chapel programs
or with the students. If it is the fault of
the chapel committee, the committee will do
all ill its power to correct that fault,_ ale
though the chapel programs arc very slim»
lar to those that have prevailed for many
years. ,

It is very likely that thc programs are
not to blame. Rather, it i the ls ‘kndni‘cal
attitude of the students tow-aid this particu-
lar studcllt nativity It has become the
“smart” thing to stay away from chapel,
whether the time is spent out in front of
the library smoking a cigarette or inside the
lib \ry. It was this attitude that made it
possblc for the Honor ”G" club during the
past week. to hold a program of its own, in
front of the library during the chapel hour.

The maintaincncc of a successfnl‘chapel
program should be felt as a responSlblllty by
students of Grinnell college. It should be
possible to arrange onc’s tlme_so that 15
minutes each day could be free, if not every
day, at least two or three times a week,

A change in the attitude toward chapel is
ill ordela Let us all do something toward
l'eanllg an institution that deserves the co-
operation of the students in working for its
successful continuance.

ATTEHD DEBATES

Tomorrow night the finals of the men’s
intramural debate elimination will be held.
Smith and Hanson will debate in Rawsoli
clubroom for first and second places, Clark
and Lallgnll \ ll meet in Langan clnbrooin
to decide third and fourth places, and Dib-
ble and Gates will debate for fifth and sixth
places in Dibble club room.

This fall these debates were placed on
the intramural program in order to create
a little inte est in debating, and to improve
both the debating and the attendance at
the debates. Apparently this plan has had
little effect, for the debates have been very
poorly attended. ,

The prize for the winner of these debates
is one worth working for. Besides the 150
points added on the intramural program,
each of the two members of the winning
team will receive $10, and the hall which
the winning team represents will receive
$25.

The question upon which the debates are
held is of current interest, and no one who
should attend the debates would begrudge
the information which he learns, The ques—
tion is, ”Resolved: that President Roosca
vclt‘s rte-organization plan should be adopt-
ed.”

The prize is good, the question for debate
is good, and so far, the debates have been
good, Therefore, it should be worth while
for every man to come to the debates and
support his hall debaters.

In the old days of railroading, the story
is told of an over-cautious brakeman who
kept the brakes on going up a bill so that
the train wouldn’t roll back. The engine
barely made the hill and the brakeman hin—
dered, rather than helped, the progress of
the train. He didn't understand how to
take advantage of the trend.

Many a person is successful because he
senses a trend before the common horde
does A man may utilize his business by
taking advantage of a certain change to re-
tail sentiment. A public officeholder knows
how to detect a shift in public sentiment.
Even a stylewise woman may beat her asso-
ciatcs to a new creation and make them all
envy her good taste.

NO STAR IS LOST

By James T. Farrell.

One cannot be very certain what
James Fail-ell is trying to do in
this latest ilovcl. If it is intended
as a realistic disclosure of poor
Irish life in south Chicago during
the early years of the World War,
it is a vciy mild success.

The book is so overcrowded with
realistic detail that it loses literal-y
value, For Farrell not only uses
the fulscmc language in the dia'
loguc, but appears unable to get
away from it in the pure expose
tion,

A well selected amount of ab-
hol-ieilt detail is vitalizmg and efs
fectivc However, when the real»
lSm infects and infests the pure
expository matter, as Farrell ale
lows it to do, it sterllizes the en-
tire work, He leaves no crude
term or vulgarity unexposed or
unexprossed in the 1ch of these
immigrant Irish.

Apparently concerned with the
wcl[are or “the individual," the
Grmnell rental collection adver-
tisements warn the over fastidious
not to read “No Star Is Lost.“
That is good advice. But even the
most coarse o oslty of any un-
dergraduate could be satiateei in
the first one hundred pages. The
book is tiresome, too long, and
with two principal exceptions and
a few well written passages, not
worth reading.

 

many can profit by taking advantage of i .

These two exceptions :ll'c‘ first,

the hook is an excellent dcfcnsc
and explanation of the Holy Rom-
an Cothol. church and Protestant
groups with similar theologies.

The O‘F‘lahcrty family, around
which the story is built, has little
to live for day by day, except the
impelhng necessity of working in
order to eat. But they ale sans
lied in the ieligious belief tnuitim
9d throughout Lhc centuries by
roster! lnLeinsLS, not dormant evoll
ll'l Clucugol that even if their Lod-
ies and lives are lost, then souls
\vlll acquire a well timed ha y
ran-ell presents a good case for
any religion that is “an opiate“

Second, Farrell appears to have
a sympathetic awareness of the
thoughts and mental piecesses or
an cleveliryeahold boy. Anyone
who has suffered any childhood
conflict of emotions or oven adult
humiliation. \Vill agiec that the
author‘s presentation of Danny
O'Neill is excellent ile also does
well in lntelllgently por ~aying Lhc
characters of the other children in
the novel

if one is convinced that the
great irish writers would not be
proud of Llielr Chicago brothers,
perhaps “No Star Is Lost‘ has not
been written completely in vain,
only very neally sc

OPEN FORUM

Editor's Notez—Not figured in the
tolul tally below is Carney house,
which received 2/113 average.

To the editor of the
SCARLET AND BLACK:
Immediately following the re-
lease of grades. the Scarlet and
Black published a list of over.
ages of the various halls as fol-
lows Rawson, 1963 Langan,
Smith, 1.7742; Clark, 1.-
Gates, 1.7440 and Dibble,
1.6547. These average 1.79406.

When the new system of grades
was put into effect, the theory
was that 8, worth two grade
points, was to be the basic or
average grade, From these facts
we might draw the conclusion that
the average man 111 Grinnell, do-
ing average work, is not getting
average grades, According to all
principles of logi the average
student should do average work
and get average grades,

Casting about for the cause of
this malfunctioning of the grading
system, the first conclusion drawn
is that if the trouble does not lie
with the student, it must lie with
the professor, My personal con»
tention is that the fault rests
with the professors that the aver-
age man gets sub-average grades.

For years. the majority of pros
fessors have been conditioned to
grade A, B, c, D and E. The
sudden revlsion of the grading sy»
stem has created a problem. Tar
day professors expect the same
work for a B grade that they re-
quired under the former system
despite the fact that the new B
iequues less work just as it is
correspondingly worth less.

Adaptation must eventually be
made to the new system. Until
there is adaptation and the sys-
tem begins to function as it does
in theory and as it should in
practice, an injustice rests upon
the student, an injustice uninten-
tiona! but nevertheless real.

The blame may be traced to
laxness and inadaptability of the
powers that grade. Surely, such'
a situation goes undesired by all,
and conscious effort upon the
part of the professors can help to
abolish this lone defect of the new
grading system.
