To Depend on Aerial Game Today ;

Start for Grinnell.

Just as the here is the natural
prey for a greyhound, so Grinnell’s

- ﬁghting Pioneers will consider the
Carls their prey this afternoon in
the ﬁnal game of the Carleton
schedule and next to the last contest
for Crinnell.

The Grinnellians, after a compara-
tive week of rest due to bad weath-
cr, go into the contest doped to win
by a margin of three touchdowns,
the largest score experts have con-
ccdcd them this season. ‘

Carla Hove strong Defense

The Carleton squad, strong on de:

fense, particularly against an
aerial attack, boasts only one threat
in the way of an offense~a long
passing attack, which if worked Suc-
cessfully almost always leads to a
score. Hank Thomas, speedy sopho-
more, will be at the safety post for
the Pioneers, however, and is expect-
ed to break up any attempts in the
line,

Coach C. J, Hunt of Carleton
brought 22 men to Grinnell. Those
making the trip were: Knowles. Per-
rin, Nicholsen‘, Nilscn, ends; Spurs

captain Preston McNurlcn of Min-
neapolis is leading the Carls as the
last captain of a Carleton grid team.
Captains will hereafter be appointed
before each game. The lineup also
includes Ray Nicholsen, basketball
captain, as an end, and Brick Muel-
ler, baseball captain, who does his
work back of the line.

The only stiff workout which the
Scarlet and Black squad was given
this week took place Thursday af-
ternoon when, after resting during
the ﬁrst three days, Coach Watt sent
his men through varied passing and

tire affair with a long scrimmage

ltIcIutire Not to Start

Ernie McIntire, although used at
left half in Richey's place early in the
week. will probably not be in the
starting lineup, according to the
mentor. Mthtire's presence will be
essential in the Creighton contest
Thanksgiving day and the coaches
do not wish to risk injuring him to-
day.

The Pioneer invalids, Captain Rose,
Thomas, Humphrey, Parish and
Heldridgc, are all scheduled to start,
however, to keep them in shape after
a long rest. Thomas has not seen
action since the Drake contest Oct.

seen very little.

GRINNELL, IOWA,

Wood Tells

Experiences
as Reporter

Tribune Man Also Describes
Efficiency of Modern
Paper, in Talk.

S p e a k 5 Yesterday

Says Today‘s Reporter is shrewd,
Sophisticated, Keeps Trying
To Get All News.

By Marguerite Konccny.
The Pulse, Ccdiir Rapids, Iowa

The following story was sword-
ed the Cedar Rapids Gazette-
chublican cup for the best news
story written by a high school
student at the convention yest-
day. Little editing was done.

“The newspaper probably ap-
proaches perfect efficiency more than
any other type of business," stated J.
Howard Wood, staff writer on the
Chicago Tribune. in an address ﬁlled
with accounts of personal experience
and the manner in which big news
stories are covered. The talk was
given at two o’clock yesterday after-
noon in the A.R.H. auditorium before
the tenth annual convention of the
Iowa High School Press association.

Mr. Wood stressed the fact that
the life of a newspaper is but twenty-
four hours, and that each day is
started with a clean slate with but
few stories hanging over from the
preceding day, “Each day grows up
to a climax with increasing activity
being evident as the deadline ap-
preaches,” he said, speaking of the
business of newspaper work.

“Most stories come through re-
gular channels such as the police den
partment, hospitals, and Coroner's of-
free", said Mr. Wood. "Occasionally,
however, there are scoops since it is
not possible to cover all the sources
and because of the fact that some
reporters see value in comparatively
insignificant details."

Reporter Has Much Tenacity

The speaker described the reporter
as a shrewd, sufficiently sophisticat~
ed man with an extraordinary
amount of tenacity. He cited the
example of a reporter assigned to
track down a negro who had inserted
a misleading advertisement in a Chis
cago paper with the result of the
near-deaui of a white girl.

The reporter spent six months in
intensive search involving frequent
risks of his life. but in the end, he
got his man. "This is the spi t of
the game,” said Mr. Wood.

“The newsroom has three principal
centers around which the activities
of the paper are grouped," Mr. Wood
continued, “These are the cable
desk where stories from foreign cor-
respondents are received. the tele-

Ingham Fears Senate

By Edward Tyler.

“President Hoover and his accomr
plishments are two different things,"
said Harvey Ingham ,editor of the
Des Moines Register last night in
response to the question “What do
you think of Hoover and his ac—
complishments?” during a short iii-
tcrview following the Press Conven-
,tion banquet. When the interviewer
accosted him after the banquet in an
effort to discover what time in the
evening Mr. Ingham would find it
most convenient to be interviewed.
he said, “How long will it take?
Here. let‘s go in here and do it right
now” and with that he led the way
to a chair in the south parlors of thc
quadrangle.

In explaining the statement, ”Hoov-
er and his accomplishments are two
different things," Mr. Ingham went
on to say that Hoover was very de—
termined to cooperate with McDon-
old to secure world peace through
the leadership of the English speak
ing peoples, but because of the fact
that our government is so organized
that a small group in the senate can
block the President it is a question
as to what will be the outcome of the
situation. “That is why Hoover and
his accomplishments may be so (life
ferent,” said Mr. Ingham,

 

In speaking of the League of Na-

 

’s Attitude Toward
Hoover’ s Enlightened Foreign Policies

Lions, the famous editor declined to
say definitely that the United States
should join the League, but he did
state that some organization of the
world powers for securing peace is
absolutely necessary. The English
speaking peoplcs must cooperate to
forward the work of world powers in
adopting the institutions of demo—
cratic government that the English
speaking peoples have proved in their
own political experience will work.
“If you can govern forty-eight states
on this continent with a system or
law, you can govern the states of the
world in the some way,” be dcclarsd,
following this with the statement,
“America. must enter some arbitrary
court. England has agreed to be
subject to the call of the World
Court and there is no reason why the
Unted states should not do like—
wise.

“The immediate need in the pres-
ent international situation is for Eng-
land and America to get together,
and no foolin' around about it!"was
the way Mr. Ingham tersely express.
ed our immediate steps toward inter—
national Co—operaﬁon.

The cooperation of the English
speaking peoples of the world was
again stressed as the crying need in
preventing the world's danger spots

‘Feature Writing ls
lnteresting’—Arney

“I interviewed Bolt LyLell at one
time and asked him if he was en—
gaged. He appeared to be quite in-
sulted and ,_ replied indignantly,
‘What? Don't you know that I am
the second husband of Claire Wind-
sor?’ " This was but one of the per
sonal experiences which Mrs Agnes
Aincy, feature writer of the Des
Moines Register, told in her talk
yesterday morning to the Iowa High
School Press association.

"I have interviewed several actors
and actresses," she said. “Some of
them are pretty easy to talk to, but
others think that they are too good
to bother with newspaper reporters."
She told of two or three occasions on
which she was called down by actors
on the stage.

In speaking of the work of feature
writers, Mrs. Arney stressed the
necessity of alertness on the part of
the writer to get every detail pos-
sible, “Women probably make bet~
ter feature writers than men because
they are able to see many details,
perhaps more than can men,"

Three Types of Interview.

“There are three types of feature
treatment to an interview. "she said.
stories: one which deals with the line
usual theme, one which gives a fea-
tiirc treatment for an ordinary news
story, and one which gives feature
treatment to an interview." she said.

She spoke of Harlan Miller and
his features in the Des Moines Res
gister. “Mr. Miller has written a
number of feature articles about the
homecoming games of Iowa colleges
and universities, Although a full
account of the game is given in the
sport section, I venture to say that
Mr, Miller's article is usually read
ﬁrst because it is so unusual.”

Sports Writing Is
Donegan’s Subject

"A broad knowledge of sports
records is the essential thing for the
sports writer of today," said Arthur
B. Doncgan, state bureau manager
of International News Service, who
talked to the Iowa High School
Press association delegates on
“Sports Writing" in A R. H. audi—
torium yesterday afternoon at onc-
tlurty o’clock.

"Sports is the youngest offspring
of the newspaper today. It is a
field in which it is necessary to have
a better mastery of the English lan—
guage than in many forms of writ-
ing," dcclared Mr. Donegan. ”The
better sports writers of today have
abandoned the use of slang, a prac
ticc which uscd to be accepted as a
necessity for good sports accounts.”

Mr. Donegan named as among the
best of sports writers in the United
States, and particularly those with
who the reading public has become
accustomed because of individuality
of style: Davis Walsh, Westbrook
Pegler, Grantland Rice and Walter
Eckersall,

John O’Connell of Fort Dodge
was this morning elected prcsi-
dcnt of the Iowa High School
Press asssociation. Mary vii-

Ingham Speaks

‘Mudern Newspaper’ Subject
of Well-Known Editor’s
Talk Last Night.

"It is of great importance to have
all around Cultural
taking up a journalistic career,"
stressed Harvey Ingham, editor-i .
Chief of the Des Moines Register and

"The Modern Newspaper,”
evening.

The speech was delivered in Her-
rick chapel to members of the Iowa
High School Press association and a
general audience, Mr. Ingham spoke
in an informal manner, devoting the
greater part of his time to answer—
ing questions which the audience
asked.

“A newspaper is a combination of
three of four sorts of occupations,"
said Mr. Ingham. “Circulation is the
largest. most important and‘ vital
concern in regard to the success of a
newspaper. Greatly complicated lies
tails arise in distributing the paper,”

Advertisement is also important,
Mr. Ingham pointed out. Yet, ”ad—
vertisement is not in any more direct
relation to newspapers than toward
billboards and radios. Newspapers
are merely the most convenient med-
ium for advertising. Not one of our
modern newspapers could exist with-
out advertising," he stated.
