Gaylord passes on

Campus canine concludes
career with Class

 

Gaylord in his younger days—iond photo memories supplied by his occasional master Doll Milhurn,

by Colin Sacks

The last few months have been
sad ones for many Americans. The
deaths of Elvis Presley, Bing
Crosby and Hubert Humphrey
touched the hearts of Grinneil
students and people around the
world. Now, a fourth death cons
fronts us, one which for most
Grinnellians may be the most
saddening of all. Gaylord Lucky
Milburn, the beloved little black
and white canine who had become
a legend in the recent history of
Grinnell College, died peacefully in
his sleep over Christmas break. He
was 16.

Gaylord will be remembered as
a gentleman and a scholar among
dogs. Most students knew him as
the small, sad-eyed mongrel who
so often relaxed with students on
central campus, or sauntered
casually into classes in ARH. His
low key appearance, however, was
in reality a Cover for a dog of many
and diverse accomplishments,

llE wits a playboy as well as a
scholar and politician. Gaylord is
the only dog to receive a B.A.
degree from Grinnell College in its
132 year history. Articles about the
modest canine have appeared in
the Christian Science Monitor, Des
Moines Register and Grinnell
He did Register.

Two years ago he was almost‘

elected SGA. president,

Gaylord, or Lucky as he was
originally named, spent his early
years in relative luxury, residing
in an insulated dog house behind
the home oi his masters, Don and
Joan Milburn. “He was always a
people dog," Don Milburn recalls.
His preference for the company of
humans to that of other small furry
animals forshadowed his later

,, accomplishments, in political.
. social and intellectual circles. .

 

DURING his youth, Gaylord’s
play was divided between the
Milburn‘s three boys and college
students studying beneath the elm
trees which once stood on campus
between East Street and the
playing fields, As the Milburn
children left home for their
respective colleges, Gaylord came
to spend more time on campus. At
first he was gone from home for a
day at a time, then two, then a
week, and so the saga had begun.

At this time it became apparent
that Gaylord, so named by his
affectionate student companions,
hada special weakness for women.
Every lall he would adopt a coed
who would feed him and, un-
beknown to higher authorities,
house him in the residence halls. In
spite of his hedonistic ways,
Gaylord never lost respect for his
masters. “He always came home
to visit us on Sundays," Joan

_ Milburn recalls.

GAYLORD'S other weakness
was for knowledge. He is said to
have attended hundreds of classes,
often listening to the lectures with
as much or more interest than his
human peers. His straightfor-
wardness and frankness was
sometimes striking, This reporter
recalls when, only two years ago,
the chirping of the birds and in
tensity of the late summer sun
made it hard to sit through a
Traditions of English Literature
class in ARH 11. Gaylord had
walked into the lecture twenty
minutes late. Then, while thirty
students shifted nervously in their
seats, Gaylord boldy and
unashamedly rose and walked out,
His integrity was questioned by no
one.

By 1972, the love of the student
body for Gaylord had risen to the
pointvwhere theyidemanded he be

granted a degree. Glenn Leggett,
then President of the College, was
hesitant, having said of Gaylord,
“l accept him as inevitabltklike
bad weather." But his Words at the
1972 baccalaureate services ex
pressed the feelings of students
and laculty toward Gaylord and
are worth recalling:

“IT is my pleasure on what has
so far been a solemn occasion to

transcribable credits; has at-
tended 42 faculty meetings; has
violated every residencerhall
regulation without being caught;
has chased 62 squirrels up 37 trees;
has participated in 34 dog fights,
one of which he won; and has in
general done exactly as he pleased
at all times Without offering one
word of apology and never calling
for a referendum.

“Look at him and wonder. He is a
mixture of seven different
thoroughbred dogs, including one
that gave him a set of hind legs an
inch longer than his front legs, so
that when he runs he ought, by all
rules of physiology, to eventually
bury his nose in the earth and
disappear underground. But he
doesn't, once again proving that no
law, including the law of inertia, is
applicable to him.

“LOOK, T00. at his repressed
energy. He is, as I said, an 11-year
old dogv77 by human standards.
But he still prefers the company of
ladies to that of men and has never
been known to waver in this con
viction. There is a \VelHounded
rumor that he is, indeed. both the
inspirer and logistical adjutant of
the Women’s Liberation Group at
Grinnell.

“Look, too, at his eyes. Some
evidence exists that he has taken
Professor Klausner‘s introductory
philosophy course seven times, and
he has assumed an all-Wise and allr
knowmg demeanor. in fact, on
those rare occasions when
Professor Klausner has had to
repeat himself for the benefit of a
less able student, Gaylord walks to
the classroom door and scratches
to be let out.

“THERE inny be fiction in some
of these statements, but 1 can

 

manipulations, but always either
votes on the proper side or ab-
stains. Both gestures are per-
iormed quietly and gracefully, and
I purposely refrain from are
ticulating any comparable
judgement about the behavior ot
others attending the same
meetings
“Therefore. witness by hand on
this document. which Without any
authority other than that which I
now assume, dues announce and
proclaim to this assemblage that
one Gaylord Milburn is a graduate
ca nine cxtrordinary of this college,
with full rights to all those
privileges he has consistently
assumed to be his anyway,”
STORIES of Gaylord's
graduation appeared in both the
Christian Science Monitor and the
Des Moines Register. But that was
far from the end of his career at
Grinnell, In 1976 he was a write-in
candidate for SGA president on the
Mockery of a Sham Party ticket,
He received 126 votes and almost
edged out his three human ops
ponents, As is often the case with
people (as well as dogs), Gaylord’s
political career followed on the
heels of his other achievements.
Student reaction to Gaylord’s
passing has been universal. A
chorus of tearful sighs erupted
from five women in line for dinner
at Quad upon hearing of the event
for the first time, Exclamations of
disbelief are common. Academic
adviser Ray Obermiller fondly
remembers the days when Gaylord
regularly chased his car,
GAYLOKD‘S departure was as
dignified as his life here. He was
buried in his blanket in the back
yard of his original masters’ home
The Milburns are now confronted

“Gaylord Mt'lburn—an eleven year old dachshund, cocker spaniel,
beagle, etc. . .in the course of his free tuition career at Grinnell, has

accumulated some 254 'non-transcribable credits; has attended 42
faculty meetings; has violated every residence hall regulation without

being caught.”—President Leggett, 1972

respond to a request from the
senior class and call your attention
to one graduating student who will

be unable to participate in'

tomorrow's graduation exercises.

“I say he will be unable to
participate, but i have to confess
this is a more fervent hope than a
hard reality, for he has so tar
resisted all the attempts of faculty
and staff to get him not to do
anything he wishes to do. I suppose
he can be said, therefore, to
epitomize the Grinnell tradition of
individuality, independence,
freedom and graceful obstinancy;
and, to use words very candidly,
sometimes a pigheaded sassiness.

”l WISH now to have him
brought to the platform so that I
can recognize and honor him for
what he is, His name is Gaylord
Milburn—an 11-year old
dachshund, cocker spaniel, beagle,
etc., who. in the course at his free
tuition career at Grinnell, has

personally regard Gaylord’s
Wisdom from witnessing his
manner at faculty meetings. He is
never confused by procedural

with the difficult task of contacting
Gaylord's many mistresses and
presenting them wrth the news. He
will be fondly remembered.

President Turner remarked
after hearing of Gaylord’s demise.
”It is indeed a death to reflect
upon,”
