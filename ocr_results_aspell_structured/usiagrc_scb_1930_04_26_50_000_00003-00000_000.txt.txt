asking: ”Is that Leland' over there?
He is good looking. isn't be? When
will he run again?"

Tolnn Is Dinning Curd

The personality hoy from Michi~
gun, in the form of Eddie T011111, was
another big drawing card of .the af-
temoon. When his heat was an—
nounced. curious eyes strained to get
the first glimpse of this sprinter who
has beaten some of America's great
est loo—yard men, including George
Simpson of Ohio.

Everybody was greatly surprised.
They had expected to see a long—leg—
ged, powerfully built negro, hut in-
stead what they found was a. short,

‘stocky, rather heavy-set fellow, but

who had a smile that won their
hearts immediately. Tclan is not
handsome and the addition of wear-
ing horned rim glasses while running,
gives him a very unusual appear-
ance.

In his premier event, he got away

‘to a poor start and trailed the field

for forty or fifty yards. Then he
uncorked that famous ”last fifty-
yard rally” and pulled into a second
place. Oliver, Leland's teammate
and a fine runner, won this heat.
This setback didn’t seem to worry
him in the least, but a tremendous
sigh of relief was heaved by the

'throng when they learned that Tolan

had at least qualified. Eddie made
no excuses, just grinned with that
big mouth of his as if to say: “That's
allrright. Sure, he beat me, But
I’ll take him Saturday in the finals."
And who knows. maybe he will?
Likes To Run

Tolan likes to run and the spec-
tators had the {brill of seeing him
go through his paces in three events.
He took second in the century, ran
anchor man on the sec-yard relay
which copped the event and beat the
meet record, and he helped the Wol-
verines place second in the Moryard
relay.

Nobody saw much of Claude
Bracey. He participated only in his

specialtyithe hundred, and that on-
ly took him 109.8. But the Rice
star looms as a very strong con»
tender for high honors Saturday
when the trio Leland Tolan and
Bracey get together for the century
dash.

It would be hardly fair to say
that the throng did nothing but
center their interests on these three
men, because they did manifest a
certain amount of interest in the
field events and various relays.

r Many Different Styles

The personality of the runners,
their peculiarities, the way they ac—
cepted victory or defeat, their team:
work, the races for the grade chil-
dren and the colorful crowd all con-
tributed toward making this great
track classic one of intense interest.

Some of the cinder artists had
long, rangy legs and ran like ostrich-
es, while others, built on a ’ heavy
scale, tore around the track like scar-

ed pigs, but regardless of how or
with what they ran, they could all
cover ground—and how!

Mr. R.W. Valentine, of Halsey-
Stuart and company, will visit Grin-
nell on April 30 and May 1 with the
purpose of interviewing students

banking. On Wednesday evening,

entine is planning to hold a meeting
in Langan hall at which he will dis—
cuss banking as a vacation, All

tend and participate in the discus-
sion. On Thursday morning until
twelve o'clock Mr. Valentine will in
terview men of the senior class who
would be interested in securing a
position with Halsey-Stuart and
Company. Appointments should he
arranged with Miss Vcra sterncr.
