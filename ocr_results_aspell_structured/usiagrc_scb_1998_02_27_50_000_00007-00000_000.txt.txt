One of the recommendations in

the report ask for a change in the

admissions literature of the college,

to more accurately depict Grinncll.

Collis Rust ‘98 commented, “I think

that Grinnell tries to be at least

somewhat accuralc about “8 im»

age but I don't think it Should

change its image to get Slu-

dcnis '_' Dcan agreed that it

was important to “im-

prove the product, not

just the covering,"

Improving Grinncll‘s image

iii the marketplace is the primary

goal ufthe Krukowski report. The re-

port is available on reserve in the li-

brary, and the writers of the report

will be on campus on April 20 to dis
cuss their findings.

small for all ofthe women varSily
athletes, especially on days when
multiple teams have home matchesl
games/niccts. It also is inconvenient
to people who use the FEC for race
rczitionnl reasons, If you come in on
a day when a Visiting team 15 usmg
our locker room, it is too crowed to
use Grinncll space. Finally, the PEC
surface has created 2i lot of problems
for many different teams,"

Abc Rushing ‘00 plays offensive
line for thc Grinnel] College football
team and feels students shouldn‘t be
quick to judge athletics as over
funded, “We put in a huge amount
of lime inlo our sporl,” said Rush-
ing, “We're in practice two hours a
day, five times a week, We end up
spending more time playing and
practicing than we do for any one

class. I don't profess to know how
much time people spend in music les~
sons, but you have to remember that
a lot of the stuff athletics is funded
for can be used by the entire cam-
pus.“ Rushing, who feels Grinnell’s
athletic resources are adequate but
not extravagant, points out athletes
have their own expenses as well.
“[The football players] have to pay
for traveling clothes, cleats and navel
shins." As for the letterjaokets? “We
get one jacket for the four years
we're here," said Rushing, “We also
only get a quarter credit per Semes—
ter per varsity sport,"

Speciﬁc departmental spending
may change from one year to the
next, but according IoAssiStantTrea-
surcr Karen V055, the 1999 budget
will largely mirror last year’s.
