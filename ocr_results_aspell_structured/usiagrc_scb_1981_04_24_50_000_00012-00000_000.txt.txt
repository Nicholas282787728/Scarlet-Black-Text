After Six

A host at school marms has agreed
that social unrest in the streets must be
quelled. Throughout the tri-county
region, eonelaves of boisterous pens
sioners are probing [or solutions to this
chimerical bane. The jauntiest of these
spinsters (affectionately dubbed the
“Talking Potato" ) sat stroking her
broad steatopygic thighs recently as
she vented her outrage at today 5 teens
Her philippics revealed a crotchety
acumen which may be of interest to
you, the unsuspecting public. Read and
heed.

“Grinnell may seem like a temperate
community but I've seen my share or
youthtul unrest here. Everyday. older
tolk are justled by youth gangs and
smart-aleck students in popular retail
stores, There’s some talk that these
types have been coddled long enough.
Nightly patrols wielding brickbats
would ensure plentiful arrests."

For the youthful ring leaders,
stronger measures have been urged by
the elderly. “Prison is too good for
them; public whippings must be ad-
ministered and soon." other oldsters
have voiced equally rough-andrtumhle
sentiments yet their shrill cackles
cover an empty bravado. Since my role
in this organ is to brand obtrusive ig-
norance with scorn. let’s examine more

liberal methods tor placating teenage

hooligans.

Professor Bifl’ Pocoroba has seen
good results with his ingenious ”Giblet
method." Troublesome youth are pro-
vided with ieltrtip markers and
ensconced in sound-proof isolation
booths. Here they while away unplea-
sant impulses by drawing up sundry
lists ot objects and proposals, Let me
now present some of the most popular
otterings oi those youthiul ottenders,

Wayne Mayer brought forth on this con-
tinent the Grinnell Relays, conceived in
satire and dedicated to the proposition
that all sacred cows and economists are
created equally open to parody.

. . . We have Come to dedicate Ward
Field as a final resting place for these
who give their sobriety that the Relays
might live. it is all together titting and
proper that we should do this.

But in a larger sense we cannot cﬂn~
secrate, we cannot dedicate. we cannot
hallow this ground. The brave people,
conscious and unconscious, who struge
gle here, have consecrated it far above
our power to add or detract. The world
will little note nor long remember what

what they do here If is {or us, rather, to
be dedicated here to the unﬁnished
work which they who compete here
have thus far so nobly advanced it is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the
great task remaining before us; that
from these honored deviants we take in-
creased devotion to that cause [or
which they have given the last full
measure of devotion, that we here
highly resolve that these degenerates
shall not have drunk in vain: that this
campus, under the Relays Committee,
shall have a new birth of humor; and
that Relays oi the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish trom the
earth. 7 Soleninl). A. Lincoln Ken-
