ASK/limit

Dear Abby,

How are you qualiﬁed to write a campus
advice column? I don't want to get advice from
just anyone,

Dear suspicious,

Qialiﬁed? Are YOU qualiﬁed to sit on
Cleveland beach, smoking cigarettes and look-
ing cool? Answer: no, because tight jeans and
shirts from Ragstock do not a hipster make. It
you need advice,what do you care who gives it
to you? (Especially if you’re that kid wearing
neon highstops.) But ifyou need more reason
to trust my excellentjudgment, here are some
reasons that will cement me in your mind as
otrtcal campus life coach.

First or all, I read 2311c, my dear Suspicious,
and I once even got Carma. These are beacons
of wisdom in our age. My advice will bring
together the brilliance of these publications’
advice. Think El-ma

secondly,1 am a senior—an elder on this
campus! I will be 23 this October, essentially
meaning there's only a few years between
George Drake and myself. I may not have
white hair or an endearing smile, but I've taken
a class from him, and that makes us basically
the same person. So thlnk of me as a former
Rhodes scholar, college president and esteemed
community member~qualirred NOW?

But I’ll keep telling you my qualiﬁcations,
although my similarities to George should
have already convinced you. I wear shoes on a
consistent basis and lend them out to those in
need of a trip to the dining hall,

I have successfully ereaterl meals in the
dining hall that taste good—actually good.
(Perhaps next week I’ll tell you the secret, al-
though my hint is [mi/1a,)

I am one of the editors of the 5533. And
we're always welleloved on campus.

And finally, suspicious, my name is Abby
Haven’t you heard? We’re ALL good at advice.
It just comes with the name.

But I’ll be honest, Suspicious. I’m not sure I
trust you.This question seems eerily fitting for
my ﬁrst column. In fact, this question sounds
an awful lot like it originated in the SE]? ofs
rises. Qialified though I arn,I'm on the prowl
for real questions from the student bodyials
literative names always appreciated.

Photo of the
Week

The $81? can‘t be eveiywhere! Submit your own photos ofcampus events to [newspapr]. Each week, one student
earns $10 fol contributing the winning Back Page photo.

 

1010 ON 10.6: Perfect scheduling. A hang-
over on 10.14, the day before midsems,
would have been a special kind of hell.

 

 

SGA: Off to a good start, but no current
cabinet member dresses as snazzily as did
Vice President Billups.

Hurry to the SEEK/12g, where the min
nutiae of your future will suddenly
become clear. Horoscopes guanin-
teed to send chills of recognition and
premonition up your spine.

 

 

SEATING ARRANGEMENTS: It is prohibited
to move the tables in the dining hall. And
keep your hands to yourselves, children.

Trans-atlantic traumas

If I said I'd never whiued about the dining
hall, I would be lying. But seriously, when I list
the things I miss about Grinnell, my friends are
number one and the dining hall is numbers two
through 7000. The carrot cake! The potatoes
o’brienl The overcooked burgers! The under-
cooked pasta! The bad life choice that is Oreo
pie! Appreciate it, friends, because one day, your
diet will be 200 percent baked beans, and you
will yearn for CPI’ like you birthed it yourselr

Izsr Writing random rents from London
is weird. it's almost like writing random rants

Nicotine runs in his veins

Three years ago we could smoke in our rooms.
It seems now that the Younker smoking lounge
(the result of tenacious efforts) is, without any

, real notice, no longer: Now occupied by a better

cause, the administration appears to have dealt a
5014/ dfgﬂlm to smokers above Eight Street. Torn
Crady notes that this has caused “no negative re»
action."I wonder whether this will remain tme in
the depths of winter, when many a North Cam-
pus testicle will disappear into the depths of the
stomach for some sweet nicotine, outside. Most,
I envision, will choose to smoke inside. I think
then, and only then (the season will come ..r),will
Crady et. al. realize one fact: You can take the
smoker out of the lounge, but you can't take the

lounge out of the smoken

The death of a free media

Last week, the Snedge inexplicably dropped
from 100 people polled to so people polled. I can
even remember when 200 people used to be polled!
(We were all so young and naive back then ,..) So
what’s going on here, laziness? Is there some statis-
tical reason for this? Has half of the campus died
from eating tainted corn and no one decided to
due us ort-eampus students in? Is the $83 slowly
transitioning the Opinion section to the NO»pin—
inn section?
