LITERARY SOCIETIES.

According to the new ruling made
by the Inter-Society committee, the
Women’s literary societies are ‘to hold
no more Spen meetings this year.

Such a ruling. we believe, gives thei
societies a rare opportunity to fulfilll
their primary iunction—that oi' wid-
ening the channels oi iellowship and.
iriendship. Each society just now
has a long list or new members, and
the series of meetings which may he
held between now and Commence-
mentgihe senior musicales, the junior
proms, etc.,»will give each society
a chance to blend itseli into a. unity.
to work and play in its own front yard
without a phalanx oi "company” look
ing on. I .

m

ed to a large extent, undeniably, tor

bers oi the group will have too little
time and opportunity to maintain
close contacts among themselves as
a society.

Our so»cdlled societies
have descended almost in entirety to
the purely social level. Few or us
are in a position to gainsay that. And
it their social runctien becomes mere—
ly a race, at breakneck speed, to an
tortsin groups oi either individually-
invited, or sent—in-aLbody guests, they
will have lost their useiulness still

| What Do You Think? I

Editor Scarlet and Black

“Will you please bring before the
student body of the college the fact
that the m‘atler or short circuitiug the
rails, and setting ofi the Crossing sig-
nal at sixth avenue, is a. Very grave
offense, and is punishable by a. term
in the state penitentiary

“I am of the opinion that the part-
ies doing this are- actuated by a spirlt
of fun, rather than meanness, and
when the matter of tampering with
public safety devices and the penal-
ties for so doing are hlcught to their
attention, they will realize that they
are placing it gre’lt many lil es in jeop—
