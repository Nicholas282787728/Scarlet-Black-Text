Soc. Poll Reveals Difference

in Facult 37/ Student Perceptions of Problems

According to a recent poll by the
Sociology 341 class, Grinnell iacul-
ty members are more liberal than
students, but less aware of the ex-
tent of problems such as
homophobia, racism, and sexual
harassment on campus. The CONr
TROVERSY/ISSUES poll included
528 randomly selected students
and 102 faculty members. students
in the “Methods of Emp' ical Ins
vestigation" class, supervised by
Chris Hunter and Kent MC-
CIelland, were surprised by the ex
cellent response to the poll, with
over to percent oi the sampled
students and nearly 75 percent oi
sampled faculty completing the
poll. Results oi the poll show sharp
diiierences in perceptions between
iaculty and students. males and
females, and blacks and non-
blacks.

According to a bookstore survey
rating textbook costs per course,
European Theatre: 1950 to Present
was the most expensive course. at
$90, with Biochemistry in second,
at $52.50, iollowed by Microscopic
Anatomy ($44). and Christian
Scriptures ($41). in order to cut
down on costs, proiessors put
couise readings on reserves and
ordered paperback editions when
possible, and in the case oi Euro
pean Theatre, the majority oi the
students had already bought the
books ior previous courses Out-
side oi actual book costs. the most
expensive courses at study were
the Rush University ore-med pro
gram, ior which equipment costs
ran as high as 3225. and private
voice lessons, at 5115 per semester

A feature on Grinnell “Way Back
When" in 1890 described how a

the yfaculty disagree and 713 percent
of the students disagree. Faculty
members, however. are con-
sistently more liberal than
students in their attitudes toward
these issues. For instance, 62 per-
cent of the (acuity consider
themselves feminists, but only 47
percent at the students consider
themselves feminists. in addition,
96 percent of the facility consider
discrimination based on sexual
orientation to be wrong, while only
90 percent oi the students say it is
wrong.

A particularly disturbing result
of the poll is that 52 percent of the
iemalc students and 23 percent oi
iemale iaculty members report
having been sexually harassed
while at Grinnell. The most fre-
quently reported torms oi sexual
harassment among students are
teasing or Jokes (36%7, physical
contact 120%), looks or gestures
iia%l. and pressure for sexual
iavors 110%). Dispelling the myth
that iaculty members are primari~
1y responsible for sexually harass-
ing students, in 76 percent oi the
student cases other students were

the aggressors, and in only three
percent oi the cases was the age
gressor a member or the iaculty,
staff, or administration, These
statistics apply only to the most re
cent incident of sexual harassment
experienced by iemale students
and faculty members. Interesting-
ly, about 11 percent oi male
students and four percent oi male
taculty members report haying
been sexually harassed at Grin»
nell,

Among the students and faculty
members surveyed,‘a gap exists
between the male and female
responses concerning the
prevalence and cause oi sexual
harassment. Both female students
and female faculty are more
liberal in their attitudes and ac-
tions than their male counterparts.
Women are much more likely than
men to consider sexual harass~
ment a problem on campus and
more likely to agree that the per
son harassed usually does not
precipitate the harassment. The
poll also suggests that women have
a more inclusive definition of sex
ual harassment.

etc.) would have been viewed as
being irom a “den oi iniquity" in
an era where, according to the rule
book of that time. “everything in
the department of students which
will interfere with their highest
mental or moral development
should be prohibited by common
consent, such as proianity,
obscenity, the use of intoxicating
drink and tobacco, gambling, dan-

cing parties, cards, billiards, and ,

all unlawiul games.” The rules or
Grinnell in 1890 also called tor the
faculty to be “advisers as well as
instructors, the interpreters oi the
rules oi propriety, and have the imr
mediate care and government oi
the students" and for students to
maintain “a careiiil observance oi
the Sabbath" and to observe study
hours and ”not leave town, enter
upon private studies with other
teachers, or engage in other pur-
suits or practices which may in-
teriere with their studies, without
the consent of the iaculty."

The Council of House Presidents
levied $230 worth of fines for
"disturbances on North Campus."
Among the students iined were
four from Gates. two from Langan,
one from Cowles, and two from
Clark. $25 each, for breaking and
entering. In addition, a Clark
irshman and sophomore, a Dibble
treshman. a Gates freshman, and
a Smith junior were tined varying
amounts for attempted breaking
and entering. and a Clark
sophomore was tined 325 ior being
on the loggia. On South Campus,
the Association of Women Students
Board suspended |wo sophomore
girls one week and gave each lines
oi $25 for violation of the drinking
rule in the dorm and gave a $10 fine
and warning for violation of the offs
campus drinking rule to another
sophomore girl

 

0n the issues oi racism, there
are also large diiierences between
black and nonblack students in
their awareness of racism. Fewer
than 10 percent at the black
students say that racism on cam-
pus is rare, while to percent of
other students say it is rare.
Dispelling the myth that black
students are the only victims oi
racism, in slightly more than halt
oi the cases the students were
white. or the reported incidents of
racism, more than 70 percent in-
volved only other students.
Differences are also apparent
between taculty and studenis on
the issues of curricular structure
and the 32 plan. Forty-eight per-

ture while only 17 percent oi the
students feel the curriculum
should have more structure, An
even wider gap is seen over the
issue at the on plan, with 90 per-
cent of the faculty agreeing that it
is beneficial and 39 percent or the
students agreeing, A significant
number or students recognize the
beneiim oi the 3-2 plan but express
concern about a lack of new faculty
being hired. As one student stated,
“I think the 3-2 program is great
tor everyone, provided that the ad-
ministration hires more faculty.“
