THE PROPER STEP

The addition of $950,000 to Grillllell college’s
endowment. announced yesterday. will not mean
a new stadium and new buildings on the campus. to
which many students have looked forward. The
campaign for the money extended over a 10 ,vedl'
period with the continued understanding tlmt the
money raised would not be used for buildings or
any other purposes except investment ill permnns
ellt rlldomnent, the income from which will be used
to support the institution.

New buildings would beneﬁt Grinllcll. of
course. but after all the college itself lies in its
gducotionnl fncl ltles, With improvement in those,
student enrollment will increase. The average cole
lege student is still interested primarily in educa-
tion, and new buildings czlll follow.

Grinnell’s scholastic ranking has been innin-
toincd neither by excessive advancement of a
building program nor by fillsc publicity. President
Main encouraged the work of a competent corps
of instructor and when he raised a total of tr .660,
000 for Gliimell. he did it with that stoii of illv
structors ill view. Many who have been for under
paid may now receive salaries somewhat in pro-
portion to their Worth. It weakness . are seen in
some department, money will be available with
which to obtain competent professors to ﬁll ille
place,

The plan of advancement being followed here
seems to be logical. To construct new buildings at
the expense of the teaching staff and other things
necessary to teaching libcrnl arts courses, is putting
the cart before the horse, Now that the goal lltIS
been reached and the endowment obtained. the
next step is to follow a deﬁnitely outlined building
plan as the college cxponéls,

A GOOD IM'PRESSION

During the weekend of May 1.2 all good Grin-
llcllidns should doll approved rcgalia (whatever it
is) find take to their flii'vcrs for the education of
high School youngsters.

The “Yemen’s Athletic association has planned
a fill] round of clilcrtllinlileilt for thc delectntion
of the visiting women. The weekend will be t pic
ally a local one. The pageant which will be given
on Friday was written and staged by students in
the physical education department. Play day on
Saturday has never received as much gelled] tips
proval as it deserves, but is nevertheless a G nnell
custom. The usual Sunday program will be
enhanced by late breakfast on the roof garden.

This for the feminine clement. But there will
also be vi llg mall attending thc‘high school track
meet who deserve some attention. Contact ilt the
men’s dormitories and with the visiting women
will be secured.

It has been a matter of considerable importance
at Grinncll, us well as at similar institution , that
the attendance (his year l'cccivcd fl setback due
to the well-idver lscd bu n so depression, The high

A POINT SYSTEM FOR ACTIVITIES
(From the Oberlin Revleivi

Ever since extracurricular activ ies assumed a
noticeable role on the campus the perennial question as
to the feasibility of restricting the student’s participa—
tion in them has arisen. The most logical method of
doing so would be to adopt rt point system.

The object of the plan is to reduce the tendency of
heaping Ofﬁces, year after year, upon one person or
a select group of persons, as has frequently been the
case in the past.

A man becomes known in his freshman or sophos
more year and often receives distinction as an upper-
classman merely because his name or face is familiar
to his classmates. Surely such a situation is not desir-
able, And yet it has existed, does exist, and inevitably
will continue to exist at Oberlin as long as nothing is
done to rectify it.

The disadvantages of the present situation are ap»
parent. There is a tendency toward bureaucracy in stir
dent affairs. students become disinterested in activities.
Ofﬁcers of organizations, because of their burdens as
ofﬁcers of other organizations, are unable to devote
their entire energy to any one activity, thus the organi»
zations may suffer.

According to the point system, each elective or ap-
pointive ofﬁce would receive a certain numerical rating
according to it responsibility. For example, the presi-
dency of the Men‘s Senate would rate ten points, the
social chairmanship of the Class one point. No student
would be allowed more than, say 15 points. such a
plan would distribute ofﬁces more completely and thus
destroy government by the few.

Many men and women, capable and deserving of
honor, receive no recognition simply because others have
an advantage over them by virtue of haying held an
ofﬁce in their earlier collegiate days. In all fairness
everyone should have an equal opportunity to attain
"fame," that "idle breath of wind."

At least the point system idea deserves considera-
tion by the Student Council as a means of precluding
the possibility of Oberlin becoming a oneeman school.

JOURNALISM, A CAREER
(From the University of Kentucky Kernel)

Journalism as a career has been the answer to
many a collegian's prayer. Newspapers are employing
many college trained men, whereas ofﬁce trained men
used to receive preference. The value of the cultural
background which is assimilated by college people and
their ability to make contacts, to meet and mingle with
many types of people, are recognized and are granted
as essential factors in successful journalistic work. That
smattering of a little bit of everything which Arts and
Sciences gives its students is developing commercial
value in a deﬁnite profession, journalism; hence journal-
ism answers the question to some extent of what to or.
when a general college education is complete.

The common conception of a journalist is that of the
hard plugging news writer who is seemingly a machine
to turn out copy, It is true that many men and women
make their living this way and incidentally live rich
romantic and interesting lives; however, a journalist
may be interested in other phases of the profession.
Many specialize in advertising, which may mean that.
they are not even connected with newspapers, but are
working for stores, magazines, corporations or other
forms of money-making organizations which require nd-
vertising. Then there are special writers and feature
writers, who write everything from the highest type
of criticism, to articles published in comic sheets, etc.
Each one has his own interest; in other words, he is
a specialist in his line of work.

It is a satisfying career for many. One may see
constantly the tangible results of his labor. Collegians
have unlimited opportunities to prepare themselves for
this work. Their required courses alone supply excellent
background for it; their social activities Supp‘y them
with poise and tact. They have the necessary i-ulture
and education. Much practical experience may be gained
by working on school papers.

Annually, more collegians are taking advantage of
these opportunities and are becoming ﬁrstsclass news-
paper folk. There is a consolation for the student who
has received his diploma in knowing that there is a
career open to him in a ﬁeld which has a niche for
everyone’s interests and is welcoming wellstraiued col-
lege men and women everywhere,

COURAGEOUS AND COMMIENDABLE
(From the Syracuse Daily Orange)

A news item states that Columbia university has
refused a gift of $25,000 because of the stipulation
that the money was to be used for the teaching of
anti-feminism. Two other well known institutions had
previously rejected the offer.

The school presided over by Nicholas Murray But-
ler is regarded as fairly well to do, Yet, the sum which
was offeredrdmi refuscdicould he used handily by any
university. The action taken by Columbia was coura-
geous and commendable.

There have been episodes of this nature in the his-
tory of American colleges which have cast a sari re-
flection upon the character of higher education. var-
ious endowments, “chairs" and the like have been tio-
noted with the proverbial “string" attached to them.
The all to often acceptance of such gifts has meant the
teaching of subjects which not unlikely have caused
the recipients to cough behind their hands.

Fortunately, such gifts are being looked at more
conscientiously. Institutions are refusing to subordin-
ate their true purposes to schemes of propaganda.

Few Best Books
Ten Years Ago
Still in Demand

Where are the best sellers of yes
tel‘year’! Gone with red nnnnels,
short skirts and model T Fords.
These are the bright stars that twin-
kle for a brief space in the ﬁl'mas
ment of literature, gradually grow—
ing dimmer until they the away coms
pletely. The best seller that lasts over
a year is doing well. one still on dis»
play after 10 years is the exception
that proves the rule.

In Becki-man‘s list of best sellers of
10 years ago nonﬁction seems to last
better than ﬁction, H G. Wells' “Oute
line of History," O'Brien's “White
Shadows of the South Seas" and
Gibbs’ “Now it Can Be'Told” are
still on display in the popular dollar
edition. The “Outline of History" is
ﬁrst in demand at the Des Moines
library, while “The Americanization
of Edward Bok" is used by children
for book reports.

We ﬁnd a familiar name or two in
the ﬁction that was all the rage ten
years agoi“Main Street,“ Wharton's
“Age of Innocence," Athertou‘s “The
Sisters-in-law," Zane Grey's “Mystcrs
ious Rider,” “Moon-Calf" by Dell, and
“Miss Lulu Bett” by Zona Gale. Miss
Cale was one of the speakers at
Homecoming this year.

Des Moines libraries agree with
bookstores that “Mysterious Rider”
and “Main Street" are the only two
1921 ﬁction best sellers in demand to-
day, with an occasional call for
“Moon-Calf" or “The Age of Inno-
cenca.” “Miss Lulu Bett”'and “The
Sisters-insLaw” have a limited circu-
lation, while they are never in ties
mand at bookstores.

All of which makes one wonder
how many among "Grand Hotel."
“Bridge of Desire," “Back Streets"
and the other best sellers of today
will be alive 10 years from now.

lngham Writes

for Tanager

{May Issue Includes Article
by Prof. E. D. Strong,
Others of Note

By LUIDA WENDELL

Harvey Ingliam in the May Tan~
tiger, writing on “Our Big Problem,"
painstakingly analyzes the universe
with clarity of vision and a some-
what labored logic, in search for just
iﬁwtlon of the egotism and godliness
in ﬁnite life. Dr. Jeans, Eddington,
Bertrand Russell, contribute to the
ultimate solution at which Ingham
arrives lucidly enough, after he has
declared his questionable conviction
that life, human life in particular, is
neither incidental nor accidental.

One wonders how this writer, who
asserts that healthy sleep, digestion.
and love are nineteen twentieths of
life, can have the audacity to vaunt
man’s “divine mind," presence of
which “we cannot escape," as the
controling factor of the universe.

strong Defends Cause

“Southern Opinion," Earl D.
Strong's brief article. has the alas
ments of statesmanship. He has a
real cause, courage, and intelligence
to defend it; he perceives the situa-
tion, not at an angle, but in perspecs
tive. Consequently he is able to ex-
,pound a fair and sensible decision.

Jay Sigmund's short story, “The
Mystic", is what one expectsipatr
ient, disheartening realism. This writ-
ter, with a hint of pathetic fallacy,
fumbles, as life will, toward express—
ion of a universal yearning. the con-
ﬁiet between soul's ﬁre and body's
damp-wood inertia which will not be
consumed.

“The Songs We Spill" and “Drops

comb, are whimsical, rythmieally gay.
and tender.

While those poems by Ann Win-
slow, “Caprice" and “Second Spring”,
are neatly. delicately turned, the imv
agery and movement of the second
strophe in “New Moon" attains the
true sureness of poetry. James Da-
dant, Charlotte LaRue, and Marjorie

and a poem.
