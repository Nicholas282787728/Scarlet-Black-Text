AN ANSWER

(Editor’s Note: This is a reply to an editorial which appeared in
last Wednesday’s Scarlet and Black. The stand taken by either
writer is not to be construed as being the editorial policy of the

paper.)

The platform and doings of the N.S.R.A. are silly

I when taken by themselves, but there does happen to be a

definite, serious motive behind this organization. Pe'

helps, the best way to criticize something that is unwise is

by satirical imitatio It is this which We are elldeavoring

, to do. To the intelligent person this should have at once

become apparent. However, we are not radicals, and we are
not against the government.

The present administration has done several good
things including the fortifying of our banking institutions,
and making the financial path through education easier.
However, our aims are by parody to endeavor to prevent
raids on the treasuly by organized minorities where the
occasion is unjust, to prevent the passing of unwise, op-
pressive, and unfair taxation bills through Congress, and
to rid the government of the trend toward the worst as—
pects of socialism.

Does this deserve criticism? It is the \vont of many
people to back down and take llo~interest ill the doings of
our government, and it is these very people that we want
to wake up and take a look at what is going on.

Other Editors Say—

THE PAL‘SE FOR AIM—IT’S A LONG SHOT
(Daily Northwestern;
The complicated machinery of education has been whirring at a
~ great rate. The wheels have been turning, the cogs have been mesh-
ing. The last operation is under way. Soon the completed product
will begin to drop out the graduation chute all wrapped in cellophane
and labeled “educated."

The product will be called a bachelor of arts or a doctor of
philosophy or some other high sounding title, but it will be just
another job hunter in a week. It won’t know where it is or where
it is going, All it will know is where it has been.

This is in short an indictment of the educational system. There
is no concrete objective. There is no clear cut goal. All we have
is 'a somewhat hazy idea of what an educated man should be—a
nebulous idea of what should be a foundation for life.

Before an intelligent man pulls the trigger on a gin, he wants
to know at what he is aiming. He would never think of just points
ing the weapon at random and then shooting. But when it comes,
to education, our intelligent man is content to aim his gun either at‘
random or at a whispy form in the distance.

Four years is a long time to spend going through a machine to
make something you’re not sure you want. Four years is a long
time to travel without a destination.

Education needs an objective. We can’t go on with a confused
system much longer. It is about time that the college student
stopped the machinery, stood oif in the distance and said: "What the
niA."
