The men's and women's swimming teams
experienced hoth sides otdoininatien this past
weekend after routing opponent Coe College
on Friday, only to lose hornrieally to Luther
the next day. Attei trouneing Coe by more
than 100 paints. the men's team would go on
to lose to Luther by an equally wide margin
The women's team saw similar results, beat-
ing Coe by over 50 points but losing to Luther
by nearly a hundred. “we kinda ran over Coe
College, but then got run
over by Luther,” said Nate
Wittnam ’09.

As expected, the win
at Coe College was easy to
come by. "We were able [D
change out lineup around
and still eetne away with a
comfortable win," said Head
Coach Erin Hurley. Many
of Gi‘innell's swimmers
broke their 'usual routines
and competed in unfamiliar events. Even so,
Grinnel] easily cleared Coe's small and less cx-
perieneed team.

Several swimmers highlighted the event
with excellent times.‘ Matt Remissong ’08
and John Willuhn '10 both posted personal
best times in their respective events. Grinnell
swimmers won the majority of events on the
men's and women's side, including wittnam
with three event wins and Meghan MeDoniel
'10 in two events.

But Saturday’s meet at Luther ended quite
differently for Grinnell. “We all were fired
up, but kinda tired because we had the meet
at coe the day before," said Morgan Horton
'11.“They didn't have any meets before so they
were fresh".

Horton experienced the most dramatic

hard to Will

upset”.

”The last 50yatds we were netlt
and neck, both really trying

the storebaatd and wax really

event loss of the day, in which she was out
touched in the IOOOsyard freestyle by less than
halfa second. Horton ms losing until the fr
nal 100 yards, when she passed her opponent
by what the 5’1" Horton described as "on:
Morgan-sized body length."

Tile race came down to the ﬁnal seconds.
“The last 50 yards we were nest and neck,
both really tiying hard to wni," said Horton.
“I just looked up at the scoreboard and was re
ally upset."

The gray Saturday had
moments of brightness for
Grinnell. Horton would
go on to win the SOOsyard
freestyle, fueled by her nare
row loss. “Morgan eame
out of that first loss with a
vengemieem I could tell she
wanted to win her 500 yard
so had," said Captain sesn
Warliclt’08, and she handily
did. CymsMistry‘lI once
again was a powerful force in the breaststroke,
giving Grinnell one ortheir four event wins of
the day. Other winners included the 200 medr
ley relay team ofTommy Olson ‘10, Dan Neely
'09, Warlick and Mistry, as well as Horton and
McDaniel in the 500*yard freestyle and 100*
yard breaststroke respectively

Luther by no means overshadowed the win
at C0: College or put a dent in thevleamls high
morale and aspirations for upcoming wins
against University ofNorthern Iowa and in the
ch Championship. “UNI's sort otonr last
hurrah." said Wittnam. "We get to do events
we want to do before Ceaeh Hurley talks to
us about what we want to and should do for
conference." The conference matches look
promismg. as Grinnell has performed strongly
against MWC teams in the post and this year.
