Reagan, Mondale Face-Off

dale said.

Mr. Mondale’s Critical tone net-
tled Reagan as he moved closer to
a promise not to raise taxes in a
second term. Reagan. in happy
spirits. used the phrase he had us-
ed against President Carter in
their debate in 1580. Reagan said.
“You know, lwasn't going to say
it this at am. but I can‘t help it,
There you go again. I don't have a
plan to raise taxes." Mr, Mondale
struck back with a personal
challenge saying ”What are you
going to do7 You've got a $269
billion deficit. You can't wish it
away

Tension increased as Reagan
and Mondale clashed over the
Social Security issue, Mondale
said, “The fact of it is. the Presi-
dent's budget sought to cut Social
Security by 25 percent." Reagan
retorted hastily, “When we took
office we discovered that the pro
gram that the CarteraMondale Ad
ministration had said would solve
the fiscal problems of Social
Security [or the next 50 years.
wouldn't solve them for 5." In fact
he asked for a bipartisan commiss
sion to work out a solution after
Social Security went broke
obligating the government to
underwrite $17 billion in checks.

Diane Sawyer ushered in the se-
cond segment of the debate asking
each candidate to substantiate
their claims which question the
other's leadership abilities. Mona
dale has claimed that Reagan ofa
fers showmanship, not leadership,
and Reagan has said that Mondale
would take the country down the
path of defeatism and despair.

Mondale, who did not attack
Reagan‘s leadership abilities in
his response, diverted it to

Reagan's lack oi leadership in
reducing the deiicit. in reiercnce
to the situation in Lebanon. Mon-
dale criticized the command
Reagan holds over his duties
Mondale accused Reagan of not
needing three commission report
warnings oi terrorist activities as
well as the security recommenda-
tions made by the 0.1 A. and the
state Department.

Reagan also did not refer to the
accusations he had previously
made at Mondale lie referred to
the people's role of voicing their
will Losing points among Grin-
nell viewers. Reagan said, “that
any issue that comes before me I
have instructed Cabinet members
and stall they are not to bring up
any at the political ramilications
that might surround the issue, I
don't want to hear them I Want to
hear only arguments as to
whether it is good or bad for the
people. is it morally right."

Some or the sharpest exchanges
occurred over the prayer in school
issue and abortion. Mr. Mondale
suggested that Mr. Reagan would
allow conservative religious
figures. such as Rev. Jerry
Falwell. to dictate Supreme Court
appointments,

Mr. Reagan appeared deiensive
as he was obligated to explain his
lack of church attendance.
Reagan answered, “But I pose a
threat to several hundred people if
I go to church. I don't feelrand my
minister supports me in this
positionthat I have a right to go to
church. knowing that my being
there could cause something of
the kind we have seen in other
places; in Beirut. lor example "

Asked how his religious beliefs
effect his Presidential decisions.

Search for Grinnell

Reagan, said. “I would be the
most stupid man in the world if I
thought I could Confront the duties
of office I hold if I could not turn
to someone who was stronger and
greater than all others. ” Mon-
dale, who was asked the same
question. said, “What bothers me
is this growing tendency to try to
use one's own personal interpreta
tion or laith politically. to question
others' laith. and to try to use i|i~
strumentahties ol government to
, impose those views on others."

On the issue of abortion. Mon-
dale asked, “Does every woman
in America have to appear belore
a Judge picked by Jerry Falwell to
approve her personal iudginent’I"
I-‘or Reagan. abortion is a pro-
blem of the Constitution. He said.
“I believe that until and unless SOs
meone can establish that the una
born child is not a living human
being, then that child is already
protected by the Constitution,
which guarantees life. liberty and
pursuit ot happiness to all of
us. [These rights are actually
cited in the Declaration of
lndependencei.

Mondale asserted that there is
no way uovernment could or
should answer the question oi
abortion in every individual ase
He continued. “The Constitutional
Amendment proposed by Preslr
dent Reagan would make it a
crime for a woman to have an
abortion il she had been raped or
suffered incest."

The debate then turned to the
issue oi reliei tor the poor. Reagan
charged that the iacls and ligures
which suggest the rich are richer
and the poor are poorer Just do not
stand up. He said. "Yes. there has
been an increase in poverty but it

is a lower rate of Increase than it
was in the preceding years before

Mondale. in response to the
question of what the Federal
Government's role should be to

number or people living below the
povery level. said vie should get
the debt down. He also proposed
that we try to get more en-
trepreneurship in business within
the reach of minorities. Mondale

Reagan concluded his remarks
in the debate by resoundly pains

back America‘s spirit. “I think
there is an optimism in the land
