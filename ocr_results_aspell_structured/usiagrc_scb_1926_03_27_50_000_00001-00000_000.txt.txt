Temple April 10.

DEATH NOTICES SENT OUT

Burial per-nits and Snltpochiis Serve
as Inﬁnitlolus to nonpret And
Long boosting Session.

The Grinnell Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi will hold Grinnell's first
Gridiron banquet, this year, in the Ma-
sonic Temple at nine o’clock on April
1‘0, The plans are fast reaching com-
pletion and the banquet promises to
be agala “razz session" of the ML
lege year. 3

The invitations were mailed this
week in the form of burial permits en-
closed in a mourning envelope em—
bossed with a skull and cross bones.
Many different types of diseases ac-
counted for the deaths and a few
novel ailments were concocted, The
invitation list includes l juniors
and seniors in college, prominent face
ulty members, certain Cr‘innell busi—
ness urea, and a rather famous list of
out—of-town journalists ‘and alumni.
If each of the invitations is accepted,
Grinnell will he host to a group ol
nationally known journalists About
two hundred invitations were mailed
and the first acceptances are already
coming in.

Shirts ilt Nine O’clock

’The evening’s festivities are sche-
duled to commence with the serving of
the banquet promptly at nine o'clock
on the Saturday night of the event.
From the banquet the razzing session
will evolve. The-committee in charge
of the program gives a rough estimate
of three hours for the program, but
if the roasting is as spontaneous as
it sonreumcs is, the affair may last
well into the morning.

Part of the program consists of the
awarding of the Brown Derby, the
Lily, the Leatbcr iiedal,‘ and the Green
Gloves. These awards are coincident
with all gridiron banquets. The rest
or the program is a dire secht. but,
the committee says, “It’s three hours
of sheer enjoyment."

liLuuson Aids ‘

Subieonas were resorted to in sev-
eral cases to summon certain guests
to appear. The issuing of these sub—
peonas caused a good deal of exci‘lec
ment on the campus and heartily eni-
barrassed the recipients of the sum-
mons, Chief Manson was the bailiff
in charge,

The gt‘fest list includes Donald H.
Clark, National President of sigma
Delta Chi and Editor of the Mid-Con-
tinental Banker or St. Louis; Clifrord
Depui’. publisher of syndicate of Bank
ing and Trade journals; Gardner

editor of the Storm Lake Pilot-Trib-
une, J, A. Rawlings, head of the Des
Moines branch of the Associated

lay and most Big Ten conference
schools have already sign ed their
intention of entering full teams. A
special feature of the meet is the
high school class which is open to any
high school in the United States and
which in 'the past three years has
drawn a fast field.

Meet records are held by schools
from Oregon. Texas, and Indiana,
proving the widespread attendance at
these relays.

Undertaking Business Boonts With
Invitations To Gridiron Banquet

The undertaking business rn Grin-
ncll took a big boom with the issuing
of some two hundred invitations, ern-
bossed with a black rule border and
skull and crossboues, to the first
Gr on Banquet of the Royal Society
of naccrng Roasters.

"Red Hot static, Broadcasted from
Hell," is the text of the evenings enr
tertainment, Many and novel ways
of giving the victims the furrllned
humidor have been contrived. The
whole affair will be a paradise for
those Epicureans and Hedoniets who
are loud of the bottle and song. A
big feed is guaranteed accompanied by
“torrid reverberations of the cymbal
and file" as interpreted by the Sere-
naders, Then there will be singing
for those who care to sing; a few

 

songs interspersed
folks wouldn't sing.

Nobody will feel slighted for everyone

cowardice of a very guilty conscience
will keep the guests away. Maybe
some people don’t like to get razzed,
but they all enjoy seeing their room-

There will be the awards to the
scholar, the Sophisticated, the hand-
shaker, and the “tally spreader." Oth-

Spirit Of Housemeetings Indicate

Success In Move

“Nothing that has ever happened,"
said a local alumnus yesterday, “is so
striking a proof of the vitality of the
Gl‘inlicll spirit as the way the students
at Grrnnell have responded to the call
for help from the graduates in this
movement to make Grinnell still
greater as a college for men." During
the past week house-meetings at the
dormitories were held for the discus—
sion of this movement from every
standpoint. These meetings have
been largely attended. The discus
sions were unlimited either as to time
or to subject matter. The longer
Grinnell was discussed the more clear-
ly its advantages stood out.

than several of the other characters
and who actually appears at the open-

race and servitude, be listed after
Sucbson, the rank and dastard-
ly villain. ,

Wir‘cn M GilFillan was asked il
he would take a part in the play he
replied that he had had considerable
professional experience in the movies
—that he had oncc most realisticly cn-
acted before the comera the role of a
corpse. When he was informed that
be had been chosen for the part of
the poet he inquired apprehensively
as to whether or not he would have to
write his own verses. Being assurcd
that they were in the text he offered
to let his hair grow until arter the per-
formance. After reading the play he
declared that the part was well suited
to him.

Mr. Angus has expressed the bee
lief that the rest of the cast alter a
few morc rehearsals, will have adapt-
ed themselves with equal cutbusra-m.

A new species of chenopodium,
commonly known as "goose—foot,” dis-
eovcred by Professor Henry s. Con—
ard during his study of the {lord of
Yellowstone Pnrk in 1924. and again
in 1925, has been named “Cheuopod-

Announcement of the species and its
nomenclature is made in a recent hul—
letin of the University of Wyoming, in
which it is also stated that Professor

of which the main part is to bemade
available in the proposed Park Herb»

According to prof. Dur d E, Peck,

In rehearsal Friday night, the drills‘
showed up especially well. Freshmen
classes figure in the reed drill, figure
marching and marching tactics and in
the free hand drill. Thc Sophomore
folk dancing classes, with their cos—
tume dances and the Sophomore phys-
ical education class with the lndian
Club drill are included in the first
part of the program. in this part, ‘the
main interest lies in the coordination
‘of the various groups, and the rhythm
and precision with wliich’the drills are
executed.

Contrast to Men’s Gallic

The exhibition basketball game be-
tween thc two picked all~class teams
also comes in the first par-t of the
evening's entertainment. Women's
basketball, played under different rul:
es and with differ-cut tactics from the
men’s game, should not, in any sense,
be compared with that game. The
contest between these two teams
should be one of the best which has
been staged this winter. The squad
has kept training rules and steady
practice, in spite of the fact that the
regular basketball season is over.

One of the features of the second
part of the program, is the ballet, "The
Quest of the r‘ir-eblrd," 1‘! has colorful
and unusual costumes. Several of
these are real Russian costumes
which have been loaned through the
kindness and courtesy of Mrs. E, A.
Steiner. Several beautiful embroider-
cd Russian vests will be worn by the
princes in the ballet, while the cus~
tume worn by Wave Richards, the war-
er-sprite who is changed into a mai -
en, is particularly worthy of notice.
The other costumes in the pallet were
made by the girls thcmselvcs and pre-
sent a striking effect.
