Picnic is one of the classic fllms oi
the 1950's. Adapted from the play by
William lnge, Picnic was a smash hit
when it came out in 1955, making
George Dunning’s instrumental
“Moorlglow” a hit. It is the story
about a low hot summer days in
small-town Kansas and the olfecton
people when a handsome stranger
(William Holden) appears in their
midst. “He’s young enough to drive
teenagers to distraction and old
enough to make their mothers' hearts
stop~and he’s too preoccupied to
know it." ”Novak never looked better
and beholdishc actSIShe exudes.”

Wait 'til you see Novak and Holden
do their now-legendary number on the
deserted dance lloor at the Labor Day

Blazing saddles is no picnic

Picnic, What happens when the tired
oldsmaid school teacher (Rosalind
Russell) makes a last ditch play {or
Holden? A torn shirt never was
iraught with so much moaning!
Brilliant color cinematography by
James Wong Howe (King's now and
Yankee Doodle Dandy) compensates
for Logan's occasional lethargic dlrec~
tion. This ﬁlm was considered “new
wave” at its time oi release, and
spooned a large number of imitations:
Long Hot Summer and Peyton Place
to name just two, It should be great
fun.
