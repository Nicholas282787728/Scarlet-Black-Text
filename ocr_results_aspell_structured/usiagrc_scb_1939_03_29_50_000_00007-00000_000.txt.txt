Iowa Proud of
Hopkins, Hoover;
Left and Right

—By R.E.M
Secretary oi Commerce Harry

Hopkins recently visited Iowa and
the Grinnell campus, and appa —

ently found pleasure in returning‘

to the scenes of his college lire,
in renewing old acquaintances, and
in being relieved of at least some
of the strain of the turmoil of
public life in Washington. His re
turn suggests and makes apropos
the mention of an interesting side-
light on the development of Hop<
lcins‘ life, and its relation to Iowa
and the‘ Iowa youth of today.

Hopkins, although he is a bit
younger, can certainly be put
in the same generation with Her-
bert: Hoover, Both of these
men, in a period of about twen-
ty years, grew up in nu agri»
cultural Iowa atmosphere, and
then leit Iowa to start their
careers, Both had the same
opportunities which were open
to any ambitions youth oi that
day They went, however, in
opposite directions, Herbert
Hoover, interested in engineer-
ing, went west about 1890. Har-
ry Hopkins, interested in social
work, went east about 1912.

Today, a youth growing up in

Iowa also has a choice to make.
He also has to determine the di-
rection his iuture influence, be it
great or small, Will take. He can
either go “west” and "right” with
Herbert Hoover, or “east” and
“left” with Harry Hopkins.

For, whether their geograph—
ical environment had anything
to do with it, the ideologies oi
those two of Iowa’s most far
mous living sons are as far
apart now as were their detailin-
tions at the turn of the cal»
tury. Hopkins, steeped in the
atmosphere oi the slums in the
east, developed a sympathy for
those who can’t take care of
fhemselvm, rind a realization of
the nemslty of caring tor the
uniortuniites in some way.

Hoover, growing up with the
great west, naturally evolved a
philosophy oi individual iiu a.
tiie and responsibility.

For, in the west in 1890, with
the railroads just reaching the
1 peak of their expansion, the phil-
osophy of individualism and the
sci-called indestructible rights oi
'man were still an integral part
of every man's belief. In the east,
in 1910, there was already develr
oping a feeling of social responsi-
bility.

And so today Harry Hopkins
is n prominent member oi the
New Deal, a strong advocate oi
social security and goveriunent
aid to business, and generally

sympathetic with the New Deal
point of view. Hoover, on the
other hand, is a past president
oi the United states under it
Republican regime, nnd is still
heartily iii iavor oi the individr
ualistic idea oi ireedom of ac-
tion without interference (mm
the government.

Both men have been of great
service to their country. Both
have been prominent, and are
,still prominent, in the political
lmerry-go»round. One has attained
the presidency, and the other un—
doubtedly has justiiied aspirations
toward that goal. Both men came
out oi Iowa, and there their paths
separated. Both, however, are
still popular with Iowans, al-
. though perhaps not with the same
Iowans. Doesn't this give Iowa
some claim to being as open-
minded a state as there is in the
Union?
