CARLET AND BLACK extends

the sympathy of the entire col»
lege CommuniLy to the one or their
number who lies critically ill. We can
assure his parents that the anxiety
which they reel is shared with them
in no small measure by the college men
and women. This son has won many
friends during his college course in
Grinnell rind we all regret most deeply

his illness at this time. May an Ail-
Wise Father restore him to health

and happiness.
E are devoting a good deal of
space this issue to adiscussion oi
the Vesper service, but believe that it
is worth While. We ask the students
to read carefully the article by Mr.
Beyer as We believe that he states the
general opinion oi the student body
However, Elite! all has been said, SCAR-
LET AND BLACK is of [he opinion that
the present service is an enjoyable one
but that. the spiritual value received
is 3.5mm] one. \Vhen less than tiily
per cent of the college students [all to
attend any service except Vespers, we
maintain that the spiritual henelils’
derived are not suiiicieilt for their
needs. of course this condition is no
fault of the Vesper service alirl so long
as the great majority favor and enjoy
the present service, wesay, maintain
it by all means. “'6 only throw it out
as a. suggestion that music does not
satisfy the soul of every sinner and
that our religious service hicks ilie
Spirituality which ought to climacter-
ize the serrices in acollege With the
motto "Christa dune."
