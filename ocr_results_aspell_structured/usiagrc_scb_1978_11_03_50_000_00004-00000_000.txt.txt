Good intentions
go awry

The college’s good intentions involving human rights
issues seem to have backfired.

Last year, prompted by student pressure, the Board of
Trustees adopted a policy concerning the college's in-
vestments in companies which do business with South
Africa. The Board rejected both limited and full divestiture
of stock in such companies, and instead set up a mechanism
whereby the college, as a shareholder, votes on resolutions
(or proxies) brought up by other shareholders concerning the
operating procedures of each particular company. Many of
these proxies concern human rights practices, and they are
not restricted to South Africa. With this policy, the Board
felt it could act in a constructive manner to sway companies
toward a human rights stance.

BUT HOW HAS THE Board voted on these proxies? In
every case it has voted AGAINST each shareholder
resolution calling for a greater concern with human rights.
Instead of swaying the companies toward human rights, it
has acted to preserve the status quo. This is, to say the least,
dissatisfactory, and not at all what students had intended
when they brought the issue before the Board last year,

Chairman of the Board Fritz Maytag termed most of the
resolutions “impractical” in justification of the Board’s vote.
Close examination of the proxies reveals that some of the
resolutions were indeed impractical, but others were quite
feasible.

BUT EVEN IF ALL THE resolutions were impractical,
and the Board had no other choice but to vote against them,
this indicates that there is something drastically wrong with
the college's policy. It simply is not accomplishing what it
set out to do.

If the college cannot communicate its concern about
human rights through proxy votes, then some other
mechanism must be constructed to enable Grinnell to voice
its opinions, At the very least, if the trustees feel that most
shareholder resolutions are unsatisfactory, they should
sponsor their own resolutions concerning human rights.

THE COLLEGE SHOULD also consider limited
divestiture along the lines of Carleton College's policy (see
articlel. Divestiture is not totally unfeasible—other colleges
and universities have taken that route. It's just a question of
how much we care. .

It's a shame that the issue has died down just when it
really should be heating up. If the students felt that they had
accomplished what they set out to do when the Board for-
mulated this policy, it seems they were sadly mistaken.

We should continue to exert pressure on the trustees
Maytag and other trustees have asserted that student
opinion does indeed inﬂuence them. Let's find out if this is
true. We should communicate our opinions on the
shareholder resolutions to the Board and monitor the
Board’s votes. We should also push for a more far-reaching
policy, Students should not let up on the South Africa issue.

Periodically crazy in the library

I’m feeling really editorial so i
think I’ll complain about some
veiy petty issue like the library's
policy on periodicals. There was a
great article in Niiticnnl
Geographic that I wanted very
badly to read, but when I went to
the library to do SO I was told that
the issue had been checked oul.

I also found out that current
periodicals were allowed out for a
week. This was puzzling, since
most libraries I've been exposed to
before don't allovl current issues
out of the building, and if they do it
is only on an overnight basis,

NOBODY I'VE talked to about
this had ever given the matter any
thought before, and many of them
said “Who cares?” Well, however
ridiculously mlniscule an issue it
Seems, I decided to make it my
baby, since i don’t really have the
funds for subscribing to 134
magazines and the last one I
bought at the book store was
missing eight pages of John
Belushi.

it just seems to make sense to
me to keep new magazines around
where they‘ll be available for a
larger number of people to read
while they’re still current. If
people feel a need for a new article
for an extended period of time,
they can xerox it, buy their own
copies or spend a lot of time at the
library,

I DID MAKE A phone call to a
library policy maker, who
acknowledged my complaint but
said he thought that any kind of a
change in policy would cause a
“public outcry.”

Iliad more or less given up on the
subject when something in the
campus memo caught my eye
“New Periodicals Policy."

“30V,” I THOUGHT, ”now
that‘s progress; a lone voice can
get things changed." Sure enough,
there had been a change in the
length of time magazines could be
checked out: it was extended to 13
days.

Obviously radical action has to
be taken. I have a solution which
will make periodicals available for
reading in the library at all times
without changing what is ap-
parently a widely accepted check-
out policy. lt’s so simple: stock the
library with magazines that no one
will want to check out. One such
publication is the monthly journal
of a little known science, organic
anthro — Socio , psycho » meta -
physics—the philosophy that
allows you to shave without feeling

‘r‘seem

guilty. An explanation tollows,

MILLIONS OF Views ago in
some riit valley not too far from
here. the first ape crawled out of a
tree, cocked his head, and blurted
out ”Euripides!" “Keats!" and
“Mamfesl. destinyl” ile know now
that he was CiVillZed, that there
was more to life than Edgar Rice
Burroughs, that the American
Indian was a hopeless
anachronism. and that the workers
controlled the means of produc~
lion More importantly, he knew
that he needed a Shave, and took
care of that immediately

Look, we want to have a
smashing, sacking good bash.
loves It’ll be an all-campus afr
fair—everyone is invited. The only
catches are: 1) it is in London; 2)
we need about 370 pounds and 60
pence to pull it off.

The theme 01 the First Annual
Bayswater Bitter Blast is “In-
ﬂation in London." We felt the best
way to convey the excitement,
charm, enlightenment and culture
shock of merry old England was to
invite everybody to wing aver
November 24. (Now we know you
can all come~it’s the skip-day
after Thanksgiving.) We’re going
to show you how to do it up proper.

THIS IS HOW we see it. The
college should book five charter
747’s out of Chi-town (Laker would
love to handle it). That is enough
seats for the whole student body,
the entire facility and mostof BhG,
for a mere 57 pounds each. Now
don't fret about your arrival;

. we’ve alread ordered a ﬂeet -{

invented, but this was a hollow
victory and civilization lived for
generations in the five o'clock
shadow of a twin-edged guilt
complex.

But now there is hope, for the
ideas discussed in Organic-anther
sociopsythu-nletapllysics Weekly
Show how people can transcend
facial hair hang-ups by doing
mental exercises like watching
Emergency every day and writing
really bizarre editorials for college
newspapers.

I'm going to bed now but rm
sure you'll agree that with
material like the above in the
library, there will be no shortage of
current magazines on hand for all
to enjoy.

Come along, loves

hacks to meet you at the airport.

Now about the pounds. Since 2
we‘ve been shedding the pounds
faster out of our pockets than off .
our bodies (due to typical in
dulgence iri McVitie’s and Cadr
bury'siwell, we have to support
our British economy!) we’ve come .
up a little short.

SO. UNFORTUNATELY, On top
of the 470 pounds we’re asking for
from Initiative Fund, we’re going
to have to hit everyone for 25p at
the door. Anyway the best way to
convey our theme is to show you

our proposed budget.
Now don’t worry your heads over

these details. Just give us the quid »
and we’ll give you a party that will
make the Loose Hall Ball and
James Gang Bang and any toga
party pale by comparison.
