By Ken Kassehaum

The last tow weeks have seen
headway in combating the
seourge of cheating. Student inn
tel-est in the problem and con-
cern tor finding means to alle-
viate it have been at an en—
eouregingly high ,level, Council
representatives have come to
meetings with helptul reports
from their respective hells.

it is hoped the students will
rollow elosely all steps taken
and will continue to otter their
suggestions through hall repre—
sentalivcs, letters it) the edilor.
petitions end other means or
communication.

Recently the ineuity took
sortie initial steps to strengthen
their ,nrea in order to arrive
at some otieetivs and agree
able solution Next week they
will receive a report from the
Council eontaiuing the diverse
opinions oi students eoueerue
iiig the urohlein and its Unlu»
Lion. ill is tell: this will he
iieiiirui in establishing a stutt-
outrldcully derived politi-
concerning aeadcinic honor.

But, not withstanding inc
concrete steps that will be
taken. a part or our piohtem is
heing solvcd by a reconsidera—
tion OI attitudc, both an the
port oi the otrender and the
nonoilendmg hystender. By no
means universal, it is nonethe—
less hopetul.

it was a revolutionary and
praiseworthy move on the part
of Dr. Bowen, Nov 23. when he
met intormatly with all students
who eered to eome, to explam
the reeent trustees deeisum
about the tuition inerease I am
not concerned whether the raise
itself is good or had, justified
or untustitied. i rather hopc it
set a precedent ior that kind ot
meelmgitu he used \\lth dise
eretiou, of course The same in-
opirallon behind the roundtahlc
can be another way of turthet»
lag better understanding be-
tween the student body and the
powers that he. it and when
this innovation should be roe
peated, l predict a larger turn-
out of students.
