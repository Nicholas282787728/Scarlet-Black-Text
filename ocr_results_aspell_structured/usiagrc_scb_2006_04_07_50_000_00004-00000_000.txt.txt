Springsteen, service and a sloe gin fizz

Traveling Grlnnelll'ans generate spring break listening lists of best toe-tapping tunes

Gina Tarullo ‘06 reminisces

 

1i uThunder Road'L Bruce Springsteen
2. “Andrea"7 Fabrizio d’Andre
3. “What Would Woody Do?"

— Dana and Susan Robinson
4. “For Guy’s Eyes Only”— Hockey Night
5 "Aspera'L Erin McKeowrl

 

 

 

1. Bruce Springsteen's the boss. Any song that includes the
Line “you ain‘t a beauty, but hey, you're alright" is music in my
book. It reminds me of the time 1 saw the Bruce Springsteen
cover band Bruce in the USA and pumped my net with a room
full of40 year old men.

2. My sister played this song for me over break She wanted
me to listen to it because it reminded her of a mutual friend
of ours, Andrea, who we met in Italy, He passed away earlier
diis semester and the song is really great to listen to hecauscit
sounds like it could have been written about him even though
there's no way it was, It made me really sad and then it made
me really happy It also made me really confused because it's in
Italian. It sounds like something you would hear on the street
in Italy And he’ll sing a line and then whisper the line, which
is a creepy thing to do.

3. I heard this song at an open mike night near Harvard
University. It was written the couple that performed bluegrass
songs together in the bar. It was potentially the worst song I‘ve
heard in my entire life because it was about Woody Guthrie,
who's really cool, but it was a really horrible song. A totally un—
cool song. Basically, I’ll be making fun of that song for the rest
or my Life.

4. I really like the song because of this one part where they
count to nine in the middle of the song. It sounds like the
counting they did on sesame Street. I saw the band over break
in Chicago. They played at Grinncll a couple of weeks before
break. After the show, I went up to one of the band members
and said “I go to Grinnell" and he said “Oh really? Wejust played
there a couple of weeks ago.” And 1 said, “Yea. I know. That's
why Ijust told you that." It was awkward.

Jeff Raderstrong ‘09 celebrates the South

 

1. “When the Levi Breaks” — Led Zeppelin

2. “All Shook Up" — The Jeff Beck Group

3 “Me and Bobby McGee" cJanice Joplin

4. “This Land is Your Land" 7 Woody Guthrie
5. “Born on the Bayou" — CCR

 

 

The New Orleans flavor of this
track list is no coincidence. Spendv
ing a week of spring break gutting
out houses in the ﬂooded remnants
of the Big Easy, Jeff Raderstrong
'09 was bombarded with thoughts
of these musical representations of
New Orleans, America's South and
American camaraderie. Led Zep-

pelin’s rune particularly struck Rader-
strong.

“In New Orleans, there's the Up-
per and Lower Ninth, so driving over
rhe lower ninth you could see where the
levy broke and I would just be listening
to that song in my head. Raderstrong
said, “You know, it's a really haunting
song, It was kind of like a really good

backdrop to what I was doing.”

The remaining songs also played
into Raderstrong’s altruistic spring
break endeavors, representing his
revelries in the nation's Deep south.
“I always have a song playing in my
head,” He said. “It's the soundtrack

of my life."

Jake DeBower ‘06 drinks to German sexbombs

 

 

1. “Sexbornb” — Tom Jones

2. “Coin—Operated Boy”— Dresden Dolls
3 "Sreh auf, wenn du am Boden bist”7 die Toterl Hosen
4. “Travelin' Thru"~ Dolly Patton

5. “Sorry” Madonna.

 

 

By the looks of his spring break
music, Jake DeBower aspires to be
a German sexbomb. The Dresden
Dolls include a Deutschestadt in
their name, the Dead Pants arc Ger-
man, and even Madonna joined in
the fun, whispering “Ich bin nanrig,"
at the beginning of“Sorry." Debow—

cr’s break, like his music, was eclectic,
yet reasonable. DeBower took a two-
week break from his teaching German
Lab and weaving wild tales for fiction
seminar to drink sloe gin ﬁzzcs with
his sister. Inevitably though, he listened
to songs that were incredibly catchy,
by artists with catchy personalities,

Though he spent some time during
the break reﬂecting on feeling low,
even the saddest songs he listened to
were uplifting. He’s headed back re-
freshcd by sloe gin and long drives,
ready to travel through graduation
and to the real world.
