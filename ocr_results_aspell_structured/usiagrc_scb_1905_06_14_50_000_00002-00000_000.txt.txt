THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL.

Sheridan’s Play Fresemed to a large
Audience by Members at
Senior Class.

An eager audience taxed the cdpnc~
ity of the Colonial Tllednre last crew
ing to hear the chm-ming production
of Sheridan‘s, “The School for Seallr
dal.” From the time that the curtain
went up at eight thirty until it closed
at a much later hour, there was never-
a moment when the audience did not

pay the closest, attention.

The play itscliis rather light and
frivolous and deals with a subject
rncttcr which requll‘esa good interr
pretatiou in order to maintain inter-
est throughout. It is devoid of all
oblectionable features and is a (llama
which is well adapted for college dlu»
mathS.

There were no particular stars but
all, bot-h individually and collectirely
played their parts Well. The part of
Sir Peter Teazle, apeerisll, nervous
old mcn, perhaps, forth the
greatest applause and Mr. Weber
entered more fully into his character
than the others, although Harold
Hutchins as Sir Oliver Surface imper-
souated the part of c rich old English
gentleman very sotisiactonly, The
scene with his nephew Chailes in the
thin act showed him atllis best. Miss
Swan as Lady ’J'eazle, the young wife
of an old husband plcyed the part well
though in some cases it was over-
drawn. sue appear-cu at her best
when quarreling with her- husband
and teasing him in a tantali/ling man-
ner. The parts of Joseph and Charles
Surface as played by Walter Spencer
and Paul Ti'igg were true to life and
both did credit to themselves. The
part of Mr, Spencer was rather a dim-
cult role to say the least. Jay Van
El‘era as the Jewish luolley lender
Showed his ability in that line and
fully impcl’sollated all the character
isticsof the Israelite. Miss Val] Dylte
