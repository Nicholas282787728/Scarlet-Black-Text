In its literature and mission, Gritinell College emplrae
sizes the multicultural, international makeup of the student
body, highlighting the
unique global dynamic
of a school located in
the heart of America's
farmland. However the
Student Government
Association, the ruling
representation {or all
students, is predomi-
nantly homogenous.
Currently, the only
member of SGA Ofﬁ’
cial who is not a “non-
hispanie white" is Joint
Board senator Harsha
Sckat ’09. an American of Indian descent, In addition, inn
ternarional students, while accounting for 13 percent orthe
student body, have no ptesenee on Joint Board. Caucasian
Americans, on the other hand, make up 60 percent or the
student body yet constitute 27 out of 28

positions on Joint Board. If ,5 going m rake ”mg W

Even though members of SGA have a
wide diversity ofinterests and participate
in many other extracurricular activities,
minorities and international students are
noticeably lacking iii student government.
“SGA in the past has done a systemati~
cally bad job involving minority groups,"
said son president Megan costing-02.

One suggested cause of this gap is the dynamic created
by having international students attend a special orientation
before NSO begins. During this time berore the majority

Diversity missing in makeup of SGA?

or ﬁrst-year's atrive, close friendships are termed, shaping
socml gloups for the next four years,

“International student orientation is deﬁnitely impor-
tant in helping ins
tci'national students
adjust to campus,"
said syed le‘mli '11,
who comes from Bane
gladesh, “but it does
cause segregation
from the mainstream
community."

This campus dy-
namic has not only
spilled over to SGA
but has shown itself
in other areas of the
community, such as

weekend social life, “In did go to a Harris Party," said ISO
president Nabila Mina '11, “I would want
other international students to be there
with me.”

The dynamic may
work the other way as
well, wrth American
students not feeling
incorporated in in-
ternational groups. “I have friends who
are international students But I don’t
necessarily want to break into their ISO
group," said Vice President for student
Affairs Jan Koszewski '08.

This year, SGA has made attempts to alleviate these past
problems Previously, international students did not interact
with SGA until after international student orientation was

systemolitally bod job fol/owing

This year, SGA talked to incominginttrnational students
berote NSO Goeiing and otheis think that by reaching out
to international students at the beginning and throughout
the year, their future involvement in SSA may be increased.
“Repetition over tune is key," said Goenng, who has made
it a goal to attend as many 150 events as possible this yeai.
“Vi/c must bulltl these relationships ofu‘usl ”

The election of next year's SGA President Neo Moi'ake
‘09 shovvs that this dynamic may be changing. Morake, who
is not white, has also cited a spillover of the overall student
body dynamic as a big ractor in the joint Board makeup and
would like to see more international and minority represen-
tation on SGA, On one hend,Mora1te is sympathetic to the
situation or the international community at Grinnell

“international students come as one and mainly stay
within their gruups,"said Morake. “But in order to immerse
yourselrm the campus environment, you need to go outside
your bubble sometimes, even irthere are problems wrth do-
ing that,"

At the same time, she encouraged in-
ternational students. ‘ilS well as students
from all different cultural backgrounds,
to take the initiative to run {or an import
tanr position on campus.

“Sometimes [minority and internee
tional students] might just not have the
social capital to win an elected positioa."said Morakc. “But
I tell them to take the initiative."

In addition to Morake, next year's cabinet also Includes
Alisha Mehra '11, an international student from India, as
assistant treasurer. but it remains to be seen if this trend
will carry over to Joint Board. “it is going to take time,"
said Itoseewski, “We are not golng to see the fruits orout
work soon."
