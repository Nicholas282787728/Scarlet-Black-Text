Community service has
new location, old concerns

After much debate, the Community Service Center was
moved into the Chaplain/s office this year, but group lead—
ers question whether enough time, money is available

After months of delib-
eration and discussion, the
Community Service Ccnrtr
(CSC) now has a new home.
The CSC, which coordinates
and funds student service
groups rangrng from Alter
native Break to the Davis
Buddies, was moved this year
to the Chaplains office llftel
multiple student recommen-
dations.

Despite the
move, ques-
tions linger
aboutwhethcr
enough sup-
port is being
given to the
center, and
w h e th e r
the CSC
is suc~
cessfully
support-
ing service
groups on
campus. Al-
though a student
initiative was passed
last semester supporting
a full-time director for the
CSC, East RLC Jennifer Bi-
eniek continues to serve as
the partttime director. And
while many applaud the csc
move to the Chaplains oihce,
service group leaders cont
trnue to believe that the work
needed to successfully direct
the csc requires an individ—
ual who can make a full-time
commitment.

Mary Pat Twomey ’08,
who is a coordinator for Al-
ternative Happy Hour and
Alternative Break, said it was
a simple problem oftoo much
workin too little time “What
had been a 40thourt week
position was moved to a 10c

hour-earwcck position," she
said, adding that this created
logistical and communica»
tioual issues between admins
istrators and strident leaders.

SGA Vice President for
Student Affairs lan Koszet
wski '08,wllo as 1 senator last
year led efforts to move the
CSC, said funding also rec
mains uncertain. “The worry
rs it might give at crunch
time, when there’s i\ big budt
geting crisis, or funding dries

up somewhere," he
said. “How
does [Dean
of Reli-
gious Life
D e a n n :i
Shorb] al»
locate more
time to that
and still her
carry out
her duties as

Chaplain?"
S h o r b
acknowledged
that, “there has
to be some give
somewhere, because we
don't have a full-time posi-
tion." However, she is opti»
mistic about the outcome.
“Community service, social
justice work, has always been
a passion of mine," Shorb
said, “whether someone calls
it social justice ministry or
it’s just simply ethically their
understanding of working for

the common good.”

She also has the help of
religious life intern Moses
Mason ‘99 and rabbi Daveen
Litvvin, as well as counselor
Cheryl Fleeiler-Seymour.
Shorb also said that she is
putting RLC Megan Perry in
charge of AlttBreak supervit
sion. To fund the CSC, SGA
Treasurer Brad Bishop ‘08.

said the college has increased
the cscs annual runding by
$13,000. With increased col-
lcgc funding, SGA has pro-
posed a budget of 53,000 per-
semester for student service
groups, a significant dcc
from tho $10,000pel'seme.
to: that SGA provided last
year

Koszcwski said the addit
tlonal college funding comes
from the Career Develop
ment Office (CDO). "The
CD0 was able to shift its
budget, help out with some
groups that were facing buds
get shortages in the fall and
the spring last year to try to
help them along," Koszewski
said. Difﬁculties arose last
year when the position of
a hill-time director for the
Csc was removed. “Right
now the big fear is that ifwc
try to allocate money to a full-
time director, it will have to be
siphoned off from somewhere
else," Koszewski said.

For Koszewski, more
student action is needed. “I
personally think we should
stand forward as a student
body,” Koszewski said. "It‘ll
take strident initiatives, reso-
lutions, talking to the peo-
ple, and coming up with the
money, looking at the college
budget,"

For Shorb, it is important
to make the CSC as functiont
a1 as possible in the interim
until a fullttinie position is
created. “We have returning,
committed and dedicated
students, but still no full- t-ime
coordinator,” she said‘ so this
year, both semesters probably,
we’ll be in a renewal and kind
of development stage to see
what exactly it's going to look
like.”

SGA and Joint Board have a lot of resources,
he "doesn't take it seriously." As the hour-long
forum wore on, candidates as well as constirut

which student electrons

While candidates are
determined to change Joint

a whole are taking more
of an interest in school

Osgood stops

Grinnell administrators began the year trumpctillg the col,
lege's jump in the us. IVcwi mid not/.1 Repel/Ii Best College
rankings. Just a few weeks later, the college has changed its tune
Last Friday, President Russell K. Osgood, along with 18 other
presidents who represent colleges in the top tier of the rank
ings signed a letter in which they vowed among other things
to stop using the rankings in college publications “since such
lists mislead the public into thinking that the complexities of
American higher education can be reduced to one number."A
proposed full-ﬂedged boycott, however, has been called offfol
now. “This letter," says Osgood, “is an effort to get beyond the
boycott talk,"

In this year’s rankings, Grinnell jumped up three spots on
the list and into a toucway tic tor 11th place alongside Clare-
rnont McKenna College, Vassar college and wellesley College.
This is the third consccutivc year that Grinnell has risen in the
rankings since dropping to ioth in 2005.

Recently, US, News has come under fire from several col-
lege presidents who accuse the rankings of being harmtul to
applrcanrs by misrepresenting what a pal'tlculal' school has to
offer, and llnderrepteseilting lcssertknown schools. These ac-
cusations have fostered talk ofGriunell and other peer institu-

and bureaucracy, SGA Treasurer and Election
Board member Brad Bishop '08 concluded that
either "more people want to be more involved
r .. people are being more altruistic."

on the ﬂip side ofthe high turnout is the
criticism voiced by many candidates and voters
at the open forums and in
their personal statements
that SGA is insular and
elitist. “SGA certainly det
veloped that reputation,"
said President Megan Got
ering ’08. “We are listening
to that and we get that.”

Partly to blame, said
Goering, rs that SGA has
“systematically ignored"
certain groups on cam
pus, riot actively recruiting
from or even attending
multicultural and international strident meet~
ings.“There are so many people on this campus
who are involved and engaged with the com
munity, but just not part of SGA," Geering
said. “We want to have more first-name basis
conversations with those people who didn’t
have time for SGA. Having a life outside SGA
is deﬁnitely a priority for this cabinet."

lions “boycotting“ the process by withholding their data and
essentially removing themselves from the rankings. Of course,
its not that simple No one can unilaterally withdraw from
the US New rankings, said President os'goocl. They may
continue to publish the rankings no matter what schools do

The us, Newt rankings arc an extl'cmclywell-known com—
pilation of 18 statistical categories that are commonly rrsed by
high school students, parents and guidance counselors to aid
in sitting through potential college applications. categories
val across the spectrum from ﬁnancial resource rankings to
the highly subjective “peer assessment score," which college
presidents use to evaluate the reputation oitherr peers. The
filial result is a cumulative score out ofone hundred points and
a simple list ofthc “best collar-res in America."

Despite being widely criti zed, the us. Newt rankings can
be helpful to prospective students. "Rankings can bclp [you]
figure eutwhere to start looking,”said james Nimri ’11.

The rankings also have significant application beyond
inrorrning an American audience. “In China, people tend to
look at ranks, cxplaineinngdaYrr 11 an international stut
dent from Shanghai Because people there dont know much
about schools here, they look at rankings first and then from
the rankings go and research more about a school."

When Christine Bruckner '03 began her college search,
she started with different standards. “I looked at other enter
rra," she said, “like how Gl‘inncll has the highest number of
applicants to the Peace Corps per capita. Bruckner added that
while it is “fine to speak out at; rinsr ratings, the lack ofcornr
mrtment to a boycott sun ggestcd that Gr-irrncll still wanted to
retain it top tier position

As for Grinnell's funlre participation in the rankings, in.
expressed concern that pulling out would negatively impact
his plan to return to China after graduation In China there
is fierce competition for jobs, and companies are more likely
to admit students from top universities, he said. “So if its
not ranked, they won’t know if it’s a top university and may-
be you’re less likely to get the job,"Yu admits that while he
looked at other factors before coming to Grinncll, the US.
New ranking was an inﬂuence.

President Osgood agreed with Yu's assessment that the
rankings offer at the very least a good source of information
about a college. “For parents and prospective students, lots
of information is better than less information," he said, “and
while all of us don't like one ranking or another rankingws are
so much better otrthan higher education was 30 or 40 years
ago, when pcople did not have the information we have now."
