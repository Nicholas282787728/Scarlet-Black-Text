Okay. That was kind of a mean, dismissive question
written by people who don’t actually know if there's _ _ _ A _ _
a difference between math and physics. After con-
sulting a real-life math major, we’ve come up with
another question. Let‘s pretend you‘re sitting in a
street cafe watching people going in and coming out
ofthe house on the other side of the street. First you
see two people going into the house. Time passes.
After a while you notice three people coming out of
the house. You think A) "The measurement wasn't '— - - B- - - . .
accurate," or do you think B) "If exactly one person Polltlcal
enters the house then it will be empty again." _
