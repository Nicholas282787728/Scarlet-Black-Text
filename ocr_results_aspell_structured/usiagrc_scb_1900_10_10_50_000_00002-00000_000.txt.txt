adopted the policy of meeting ex»
penses, not by personal applica-
tion, but by giving something in
return when a call is made upon
the public purse strings. And
what a small call it For the
small price of admission, each
spectator is privileged to enjoy an
hour and a halter so at real sport.
That exhibition costs the football
men weeks ot training, the trainer
and coach months of thinking and
years at experience. the manage-
ment continual work and prepara-
tion. It costs the spectator only
twentyrﬁve or ﬁlty cents. It is a
small call indeed. And yet how
pleased would be the management
to see t'hat small call heedcd. it
is extended to all the students and
triends ot the college; in a mild
sort of way it even includes meme
bers of the faculty and the this
tees. No one is baried. The sear
ond opportunity of the season
comes next Saturday at the Cor»
ncleri‘innell game. The price of
admission 15 within the reach of
nil, and n large crowd is expected
and ought to be present. This IS
the surest ivny ol cncouinging that
team and at the same time helpi
ing the Athletic Union.

only from the natural convenience
of the arrangement but also flotn‘
the standpoint of collegiate stand-
ing. No reasons fm tlic lvillldl'luw

to be presumed that Knox has

The compact, as drawn tip by the
delegates at Clinton, last June,
