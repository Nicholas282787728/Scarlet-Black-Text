I’m a Grinnell college student, It costs us
$42,000 a year to go here and I was really sur
prised you didn't address the issue or college
attordability. lwas wondering ifyou could recall
how much your tuition was back in the day and
why isn't college more arrordable and what can
we do about?

What we can do about it is I propose some
thing called College {or Everyone. I don't ree
member how much my mition was, way less than
that. Like a lot of students
who go here, probably, I had
to work and borrow money to
go through college, my parents
helped some.What I propose
is,pay tuition and hooks ifthe
students work.

Is that different than the
DREAM Act, which would
allow the children of imlni~
grants to go to college.>

It's different than the
DREAM Act, Well, I supn
poi-r that [00, but it's drrrerent
than the DREAM net because
it would be for everyone.

In your speech you talked about when you
were growing up, you talked abour young, pas-
siouate people taking action in the civil rights
movement. What issues today do you think
young peopleshould gerup and heexcitcd about
and start marching in the streets on?

Thc ivar.'lhe war in Iraq is the most dominant
and 1 think beyond rhe war, the issue of poverty,
the poor, both here in and the worldl think those
are the two big issues. And lwould wrap into that
the genocide in Dnrfur.

Do youthinkthose arcissueswhichare being
ignored, or not taken seriously enough .>

No,1 think they're taking them seriously. I
think it's just a question oftl-lere being the kind
of feeling and movement that’s necessary to
galvanize them.

surveys have shown that an increasing
number of Americans and particularly young
Americans are expressing the sentiment that the
Us. should mind its own business internationally
and letorhercounrries get along the besttheycan.
Do you think this is this the direction American
foreig-lipoljcyshouldgoinandifnot,whatdoyou
have to say to thoseAmericsns who are weary of
foreign involvement.>

Next up

No,l don't think it's the way we should go.
But i think we should have a very dirrerenr way
of engaging the world [him we have under Bush,
Instead orarrogance and belligerence and selhslr
ness,we'd understand thatwe have a responsibilr
ity to humanity and we‘re going to meet that
responsibility by doing things likc helping educate
100 million children in the world who do not
have any education, along with the international
community. Stopping the spread of disease, I
think we ought to invest at least $50 billion in
HIV/AIDS over the next ﬁve yearsl think we
should invest in clean drinking water and sanirm
tion, which would make a big dent, I know from
my own work in Africa, make
a big dent in stopping the
spread or disease. Economic
development, .nicrolending,
lnicroﬁnance would make .1
huge difference. 1 think the
world needs to see America
(icing positive constructive
things for the world rather

than just for ourselves.
You criticize the NAFTA
agreement a lot, for destroying
, jobs and such, do you think
“ that it should be scrapped,
that its foundation is ﬂawed,

or should it simply be improved?

I think it's ﬂawed but I think what we should
be doing is redoing it, ltnd that means having
rcnl environmental standards, leal labor standard
and having a president who will enforce those
standards

The \Vashington Post poll that was released
[Nov. 19] shows that 24 percent ofyour lowa
supporters are ﬁrstrrime caucus goers, which
is about half the total for Senator Clinton and
senator Obama's campaign. What do you think
this says about, ﬁrst, your appeal to experienced
caucus goers and second, your appeal to people
who are new to the process?

Oh,I think it's a mistake ro put too much
weight on any poll, there have been a million
polls done. What 1 would say is it’s a very close
competitive mcc between the three of us here in
Iowa. speaking tor my campaign,l want to reach
our to young people, motivate them, excite them.
1 mean rm mlking about shaking things up, I’m
not talking about the status quo,1‘m talking about
taking the power out of the hands of the few and
giving it to the many and I think that's the kind
ofcnuse young people care about.

Because ofhis poor performance in national

Biden is also noted for his knowledge of
