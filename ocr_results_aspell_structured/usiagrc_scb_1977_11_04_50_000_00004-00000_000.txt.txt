Ticket system
_ a good‘idea

Rarely is an all-campus party anything other than good
fun. Tomorrow night's James Gang Bang will surely be good
fun, but it is also tied to an important issue

The Gang Bang is being used as a test of a new ticket
sytem for dispensing hard liquor. The results will greatly
inﬂuence the nature of the alcohol proposals soon to be
submitted to the Joint Boards by various committees
dealing with the alcohol issue.

WE URGE EVERYONE to help make the Gang Bang run
smoothly. The ticket system, which was the innovation of
members of James Hall and which entails selling, before the
Gang Bang, a 25-cent ticket for each hard drink, is clearly
the best system.

One benefit is that it promotes moderate drinking. With
drinks now priced and with the ticket sytem fostering
planned, responsible drinking during the Gang Bang,
drinking will not be as excessive as in past years. The af-
finity many Grinnellians have for alcohol does not present a
good image of the college or its student body, It is clear that
many Grinnellians consistently endulge in heavy, carefree
drinking merely for drinking’s sake. Last year‘s open bar
policy seemed to encourage such endulgence. Also, alcohol is
almost always the main focus of Grinnell social events;
alcohol attracts people to an event and when it is gone, the
event breaks up. The ticket system will help to change the
attitude many students have toward alcohol by showing that
a good time is possible without freely ﬂowing alcohol.

BUT MORE IMPORTANT than any change in attitude
or image is the decrease in dangerous and inappropriate
social behavior that moderate drinking will bring. Excessive
drinking at Grinnell often leads to abusive drinking, which
shows itself in the form of rowdiness and vandalism and
could lead to students driving while under the inﬂuence of
alcohol. Furthermore, freely ﬂowing alcohol at events

, exacerbates the problem of people spending weekend nights
and even weekday nights alone in their dorm rooms drinking
heavilyr This is one of Grinnell‘s most serious, yet least
visible problems.

Another advantage of the ticket system is that it allows a
substantial amount of SGA money to be reallocated. Rather
than promoting the negative conditions described above,
such money should be used to improve Grinnell's social
situation and to make purchases too expensive for an in-
dividual to afford. Concerts. dances, movies, stage acts and
speakers are better investments than alcohol.

A MOVE THAT would add to the benefits brought by the
ticket system would be to extend the system to beer. At the
Gang Bang, only hard liquor will be covered.

The arguments made above are, to be sure, based on moral
attitudes. Moral attitudes underlie the arguments being
made by every interested group on campus. Though a good
argument could be made that dictation of campus moral
attitudes by SGA can go dangerously overboard, a
pronouncement of a moral attitude about alcohol will be
unavoidable when the final proposals are drawn up.

BECAUSE OF THE importance morals play here,
arguments for all sides have become somewhat shakily
grounded in fact and reason and have become emotional.
Thus, the Gang Bang has become tied to an important,
emotional issue. This is not unfortunate. The Gang Bang is a
crucial test in deciding an important issue. We hope people
make efforts to support the ticket system. But we also hope
people have a good time. That's what the Gang Bang is there
for.

Town-Gowm Riloi‘l‘lOV‘
Clarification of internship proposal presented

To the editor: Jim Hansen’s
Well Written article in the October
14th 5&3 (“Change in Internship
Policy Proposed") was welcomed
by the Ad Hoc Committee on In-
ternships, for the Committee is
anxious that the entire College
community be informed on the
recent proposal that internship
study be available as a learning
Option here at Grinnell.

However. the article has one
serious error in fact that needs to
be corrected. The Ad Hoc Com-
mittee has not proposed to the
Curriculum Committee that full-
time internships for Credit lie. for
a semester or a summer) be ap-
proved, Rather, the Committee has
offered. and the Curriculum
Committee and the faculty have

recently approved, a proposal that
partrtime internships of two full
days a week, with four semester
hoursof credit, be listed in the
college catalog and curriculum as
“Part-Time Internship Study,"
instead of being considered as
“Independent Study" projects as
has been the practice for the past
six or seven years.

The Committee is unanimously
in favor of lull-time internships but
feels that the College presently has
neither the Specialized staff nor
adequate experience to develop an
academically sound and
productive internship program.
Hence, the Committee is initiating
an effort to obtain a Lhreeyear
grant to finance the staffing and
operation of an allcollege program
of both partctime and lullrtime

Committee expresses gratitude

To the editor: The Kent State
Defense Committee would like to
express its deep gratitude to the
faculty for its generous support
of our struggle. Faculty con
tributions of $125 enabled us to
rent cars so over 30 Grinnell
students could attend the October
22 demonstration against‘building
the Kent Slate gym on Blanket Hill,
Although the police violently at
tacked this peaceful demons

stration, we feel that it was very
successful. Our deepest thanks go
out to all who helped build this
demonstration and especially to
the faculty. We hope for com»
tinned support from the campus
community in the ongoing struggle
against the gym, Carry on the
Spirit of Kent and Jackson State.

A brief comment should be made
on Mark Sherinian’s disap~
pointrnent, noted in the S d: B 3r,
title, “in the amount of student
involvement concerning this
issue” of internships. The Ad Hoc
Committee on Internships (con-
sisting of four professors and two
representatives of the ad-
ministration) worked throughout
the past summer. when no sludeni
input was possible. As soon as
school began this fall, the Com-
mittee asked the SGA lo appoint a
student Committee on Internships.
That Committee, consisting of six
students and chaired by Student
Coordinator Gary Doernhoefer,
has already reviewed the draft
proposal of the Ad Hoc Committee.
and the constructive student
recommendations made will be
Incorporated in the formal
proposal to be sent to funding
agencies. Moreover, the Ad Hoc
and SGA Committees have been
merged into one committee, with
Doernhoefer as cochair. Faculty
and student Comments and
suggestions re internships at
Grinnell will be welcomed by this
Committee, C. Edwin Gilmour, Co-
Chair /\l| lloc Committee on In-
ternships

The 5&3 regrets the error.

Nervousncss mistaken for racial prejudice?

To the editor: We would like to
reply lo Curtis Cost and his letter in
last week‘s son by giving him one
perspective oi how social relations
between blacks and whites go bad.
This has happened to usa couple of
limes. Itwasn’t very dramatic, but
it made us feel sad and stupid,
We are not very sociable people.
We tend to leel uncomfortable with
almost anybody we don’t know
well. When we find ourselves in a
social situation with a black per
son. and especially if cons
sciousnesses are altered at the
time, we gel more confused than
ever, Merely because so much has
been said and written about What
goes on between the races, we

 

wonder how the black person is
taking things we say. We try to be
careful not to say anything that
could be misinterpreted. Also, at
Grinnell, we’ve noticed people
around campus for awhile and
have thought oi them as good
people but are afraid that they
don't really want us for friends. So
we are never sure. Obviously, with
so much paranoia on our side of
things, the Whole situation has to
go bad, even if the black is totally
at ease. Sometimes we feel like
saying something right at the
beginning of an encounter that
acknowledges the situation, but as
yet we haven’t thought of anything
that would be any better than “Uh,

we do have a couple of good black
friends, it looks like the barrier has
to be broken every time for every
new black we want to get to know )

We don’t know if there are other
whites as neurotic as us. But
maybe Curtis Cost sometimes
mistakes nervousness of this kind
for somelhing worse than it is. We
aren’t surprised that he does. How
is he to know what’s going on in
other people’s heads? Also, he's
probably rightin a lot of cases, But
for people like us, what is needed is
a lot of good and reassuring energy

Deplores
race situation

To the editor: In response to the
letter of October 14, I wish to point
out that things have reached a sad
state when there is so much
paranoia about racism that issues
have become more important than
people. Apparenlly, whites are
damned if they do and damned if
they don’t. If a white student likes
a black student, he is supposedly
trying to prove he is liberal and if
he doesn't like the black student.
he is supposedly a bigot. It would
seem to me that it would depend on
the likeableness of the black
student in question. I believe that
both blacks and whites would be
better off if everyone stopped
assuming that everyone else has
ulterior motives. Since I am white,
I suppose this letter will be viewed
as my pathetic attempt to appear
open—minded, If I was black, it
would probably be assumed that I
was trying in prove “I’m white."
As for this, I can only say I am
deeply sorry that such a deplorable
situation exists. Susan Errarrier
