AVIATION, PIto AND CON
(Creightonian)

Airplane crashes in the far west have taken a death toll of 43
human lives since December 15, 1936. With this record, aviation has
born the brunt of much adverse criticism through publicity. But,
there are two sides to every oucstionl

Obviously something is amiss; planes have been developed with
greater precision than any other mechanism; pilots must now meet
more rigid physical and mental requirements; radio facilities on
planes are more complete than ever before. Whether the crashes are
due to faulty flying conditions, the pilots, or structural defects re-
mains to be solved by an investigating committee, which is now
launching its efforts to learn what causes each plane crash. Fifty
thousand dollars or more is a large sum to throw on mountain sides
or in bays! Something must be donel It also remains to be solved
why they are greatly restricted to the west coast states.

In all of the adverse publicity that we read daily, we fail to con-
sider other disasters. We seemingly disregard industrial accidents.
sea disasters, and automobile accidents. Scores die daily through
automobile accidents, either directly or indirectly; in feet over
56,000 deaths in 1936 were attributed to the latter. The airplane
does not fare so well; it is still new, it is novel, even yet, and its
misfortunes are b wn wide open through publicity. some of avia-
tioll's greatest cri cs read accounts of each crash time and time
again, then close their paper with an attitude such as this, “Mm. I
told you so." This perhaps accounts for the wide breach between
aviation and newspapers. still the critics and others venture on our
highways, which are wide open for crashes. Perhaps the automo—
bile, too, is not yet perfect! Too much is taken for granted, and as
a matter of course in respect to the latter problem.

A recent report by a local air-line official shows that ticket sales
drop slightly after each crash, to be followed in a few days by a
greater demand than ever for passage. He also reports that planes
can't meet demands for ticket sales. Reservations must be made in
advance, so perhaps aviation is gaining valuable ground, regardless
of its misfortunes. One line boasts of air experience totalling over
one hundred million miles. A personal investigation will reveal that
passenger safety per mile is much higher than that of automobiles,
in the neighborhood of three times the safety:

Aviation needs more consideration and justice. It is a growing
and lively industry. It has reached the point where modern society
is accepting it more and morc, and its future will prove that it is an
integral part of modern transportation.

LOVE is LOVE
(Daily Northwestern)

Love on the campus is a very funny thing. A combination of
stargazing, pin—hanging, and gossip-gabbling, it possesses neither
the sanctity of the sacred nor'the dignity of the truly profane.

The transformation of what is intended to be romantic love into
a form of pctty larceny was immortalized in the columns of Thc
Stooge last year. Reading Thc Stooge’s account of who held whose
hand, and where, we were always astounded by the contrast Northr
western afforded to Oxford, where, at the advent of one woman, Zule
cika Dobscn, the entire undergraduate body could fling itself into the
river and without a word of remorse.

At Northwestern, love, like education, is institutionalized. Once
the sophomore feels lhosc indefinable palpitations, he whips off his
fraternity pin and hangs it on a sorority girl who, if she has spoken
too frequently with the senior sisters, barely manages to blush;
whereupon she, in turn, invites him to her sorority (lance; whereupon
they both go home to talk about it.

Some people have called this love; others, a vicarious thrill; still
others have words for it that cannot be printed on the editorial page.
But whatever it is, it doesn‘t do justice to the spring.

Why is love such a sad, sad story when it happens in Evanston
and to college students? Can it be because there are two kinds of
people on the campus: those who have love affairs and those who
talk about them? Or can it be because, in the opinion of thc univer—
sity the word does not appear in the dictionary. Or is it just Evan-
ston?

We don’t know.

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

DORIC

You may never suspect it, but
occasionally the ad has a serious
thought. When this wave of malls
tal overexposure hits us as we
write the column we must mcrcly

‘beg your indulgence.

With this column, ME in-
volve ourselves in tlic current
campus dispute about student
govcrimiant. Itccently the pa-
pcr‘s columns hnve carried
two articles. One of these was
in criticism of our present
form of government, the other
was in defense of Both of
those opinions lime their
points. My point is entirely
different.

a s a
We don’t think there is enough
student govcrnmcnt, and we also
believe, with a fatal idealism,
tha students are capable of ex-
erci rig more of governing pow«
ers. To the end of obtaining more
government and administering our
government more intelligently and
efficiently, we are offering in the
following paragraphs our idea of
an effective system which might
very well be established this
spring.
a s e

The propllserl system would
involve three branches much
after the fashion of our feder-
al system. Each hall and
each cottage would retain the
same sovereignty that they
now enjoy, and each .would
elect the same officers as bur
dcr tlio present system. A stu-
dent council would he elect-
ed just as we now have. One
new branch would be added
and all of the present system
amalgamated.

s r a
The president of the student
council would have supreme ex-
ecutive power. The other members
of the council would serve as his
advisory cabinet. The members
of the Council of House Presidents
and the League board would meet
jointly as a senate and the mem-
bers of the various house coun-
cils and the officers of the wom-
en’s cottages would meet together
as a house of representatives.
i a e

All rules and regulations
concerning students would
necessarily ho passed by the
legislative bodies and carried
out by the executive. The new
branch of student govern-
ment would be a student court
of nine members, elected by
the legislative branch. The
membership of the court
would consist of four seniors,
three juniois and two sopho-
mores.

e a s
Through this court would pass
all matters of student government.
The only power reserved to the
faculty would be that of dismiss-
ing students for poor grades. All
matters of student discipline
would be strictly for die disposi-
tion of the court. The dean of
men and the dean of womcn would
both prosecute their cases before
this court, as would any student
against any omer student.
l, i

The forgoing paragi- phs
have been one mall’s opinion.
We cordially invite others to
express their opinions. The
only stipulation wc malrc is
that you advance a new idea
or ci-iti .c a new idea. Ev-
eryone, including tho editor of
this column. is ircii of thc
constant gripiiig and the
equally constant lack of ac-
tion.

Englishman Urges Equity in Making

Great International

Cites German-Polish Piacl
as Factor Favol‘ing
Peaceful Change

Equity as well as legal judg-
ment is needed in making peace-
ful changes in the world today
was the opinion expressed by W.
Arnold-Forster, British laborite.
Tuesday evening in discussing
"Peaceful Change,” He gave the
fifth in a series of eight lectures
on international affairs in Herrick
chapel.

In suggesting methods of peace-
ful change, he mentioned volun»
tary agreements, judicial discre»
tion, and the use of intcrnational
authority to advise nations. In
relating these methods to the
present set-up undcr the League
of Nations, the lecturer pointed
out that the League lacked coer»
cive powers and did not have the
complete trust of the nations be-
longing.

one Hopeful Factor

One of the hopeful factors for
peaceful change was the German-
Polish nomaggression pact, which
still has five years to run and
which seems to assure peace on
the eastern frontiers of Germany
for that period.

Mr. Arnold-Forster, however,
listed, the present German objec-
tives as factors tending to prevent
the peaceful settlement of the
European difficulties. Hitler’s
objectives, which include the unit-
ing of all German people in Eur-
ope and the regaining of territory
lost in the Treaty of Versailles,
were cited as dangerous tendenr
lcies.

Italian Demands

Italy's demands, according to
the speaker, are intended to af-
firm the position of Italy as the
greatest of the great powers, such
as in the days of the Roman
empire.

Turning to consider the Japan-
ese demands, Mr. Arnold-Forster
listed three objectives: expansion
of trade overseas, colonial expan-
sion, and the establishment of a
Japanese Monroe Doctrine for
Asia These factors were cited
as being the cause of Japanese

Changes
aggression

The speaker then turned to
hopeful factors and pointed out
that a great rally in favor of
peaceful change and scttlemcnt of
the world's problems has been
taking place in England and
France. This Wm‘k has been aid~
ed by the economic committee of
the League of Nations, but, hOWe
CVel', the real benefiLS‘h’dNe been
minimized becausc Germany has
been boycotting the advice and
efforts of this committee.

The argument of scarcity as a
need for Colonies and raw mater-
ials was towed a myth by the
speaker. “The major need of Ger-
many," the speaker said, ”cannot
be met by colonial sources.” Mi-
gration from countries to their
colonies has been only enough to
total oneethil‘d the population of
the city of Los Angeles. '

Elise Populations

Mr. Aled-Forstet’s suggestion
of solving the problem was to
ease the movement of the world's
populations. However, the major
economic problems of Italy, Ger—
many and Japan cannot be solved
by migration.

“Unless we eliminate the risk
of war," he concluded, "we can
do nothing about economic difﬁ‘
culties. We, as nations, should
regard ourselves as partners in
an enterprise towards genuine
trustecship and partnership
among nations."

Manager Reports
Zephyr Campaign
Quite Successful

An incomplete check on the
Zephyr subscription campaign
last night by Richard Moore, busi-
ness manager of the baby annual
revealed unusual student interest.

“All of those taking subscrlp-
tions reported great success," he
said. “Especially heartening was
the action of the town men who
voted to take money from their
social fund and buy every town
man a book.”

The campaign will end a week
from next Monday, according to
Moore. After the campaign ends
it will not be possible to buy a
book as the printing contract will
be signed at that time, “We will
print only the number of books
ordered," Moore concluded.
