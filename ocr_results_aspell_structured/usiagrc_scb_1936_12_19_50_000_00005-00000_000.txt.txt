Wheels of Scarlet and Black Don’t
Just Go ’Round and ’Round

' " i
Great Deal of Work Lies

Behind Each Issue
of Paper

(lily Frances c, Hansen)

(Editor's Note; This is the
iii-st of a series of three articles
dealing with the semi-weekly
routine followed by the editorial
staxf of the Scarlet and Black.
It is being published with the
hope that the student body, the
faculty, and the administrative
officials will thus obtain a better
knowledge of the difficulties and
problems encountered by the col-
lege journalists.)

What makes the wheels of-the
Scarlet and Black go 'round?

Oh, they just go 'I'ound and
’i‘ollnd, and the paper comes out
here. AL least, that's what the
general idea seems to be. Gen-
eral campus ignorance of the
mechanics of the college weekly
prompted Max W. Hunn, manag—
ing editor, to order a series of
features on its mysterious inner
workings.

In the first place, the paper
doesn't just ,grow, and reporters
don’t Just wander around here and
there, nosing out news, and com
ing back to the office to write
scintillating bits of copy.

)lnko Out Assignments.

Every Tuesday and Friday eve-
ning Gordon Eversoll, assistant
editor, Janice Pitzer, women's
editor, and Wells Barnett, sports
editor, hover around a typewriter
in room 222 of the Alumiu Reci-
tation hall and make out the
master assignment sheet for the
next issue.

The assignment sheet gives the
name of the reporter, the story
he or she is to cover. and has
blanks to be filled in later, on
the stoiy's acceptability, whether
it must be rewritten and by
whom, whether names are check-
ed for spelling, the time it is
handed in, and general remarks.

Individual Assignments

The assignments are transfer-
red to slips of yellow paper, one
for each reporter, with the story
he is to cover, and specific details

 

wanted and persons to interview.
They are delivered to the repor-
ters os soon as possible after they
are made out.

Whereiipon, the embryo news»
hawk takes his assignment in
hand and goes atter the people
he is to see, His story is due at
the A. R. H office at 3 o'clock
on the afternoon before the next
paper comes out, and the pron
lems of getting it there on time
often prove difficult,

Feature stories

Feature stories are not includ-
ed on the assignment sheet. The
ideas are cudgeled out .by Fran»
ces l-iansen, feature editor, and
Max w. Hum-l, managing editor,
and assigned to the feature staff,
at present consisting of four
women,

When the stories begin to
trickle m on Tuesday and Friday
atternoohs, Elisabeth Dwight, air
tel-noon desk editor, does the pre-
liminary copy-readingsm checks
facts, spelling, and gramma ,
telephones for missing informa-
tion: assigns stories which come
in as tips at the last minute, and
in general supervises the news
gathering.

The managing editor drops in
just before dinner time to check
on the amount of copy which has
been turned in. and confers with
Bennett Brink, business manager.
on the quantity of advertising and
the number of pages to be run
He taxis the feminine element of
the staff home to the quadrangle,
and after dinner he is ready to
begin the second lap of putting
out an issue: the serious copy-
reading and headline writing.

Random
Sport Shots

Griunell's two-point defeat by
Coe last week has brought to
light some interesting [acts about
the rivalry between the two
schools, the filst of which is the
fact that of nine games played
since 1931, excluding last night’s
tilt at Cedar Rapids, seven have
been won by three—point margins

Some pcople were a little wor-

Masiicy appeared in the Coe game
with his shoulder well taped.
There is no reason to worry. be»
cause nothing is wrong with the
shoulder. Jim broke his collar-
hone while working this summer,
and is not taking any chances
