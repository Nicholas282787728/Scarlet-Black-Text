represent a good cross-section of the
campus and who are not involved with
the movies, Wells said. The Judges re
sponded to a message put in the campus
memo, They will choose the top diree
movrcs based on audience response (i.c.
applause) and personal criteria.

Trrular Head originally began as a
talent Show held the night before tlle
Grinnell Relays and subsequently
evolved into a movie festival held In a
theater with a balcony in ARH before it

and then, threeyearsago, restarted Since
then it’s been held in the Han-is Center.

Recurring movie themes include
the Zirkle, trains (surprise, surprise)
and Spidennan, The movies are made
by a wide range of people. and are

usually not people who have upnnicur

- ON THE CUTTING EDGE
GETTING TO KNOW CAMPUS BANDS

New bassiSt f0r The Jon Hendrich
Project faces legacy of bad luck

By SARAH STAVETEIG

Arts to Entertainment Editor

TI'ENTION bass players: be
ware ofcampus band The Jon
endrich Project. In only one

year, four bassisls have joined the band
until badluck ﬁnished them off. Figurar
tively. of course.

”to be our bassist is to seal your
fate," said sophomore Terrence
McNamara (drums).

“Our ﬁrst bassist dropped out of
schoo said Matt Hutchison (glutar).
”The second one we just had for one
show. and then he hated us. He was
looking to do Metallica or somethingllke
that. The next one left campus also”

“It seems to be an academic drag to
be in ourband.”said McNamara ”These
seniors \vhoareso prime to graduate they
all of a sudden lose their wish to live and
drop out ofschool. It could be ourmusic,
I guess. Itcould be Bill's guitar solos."

Firstryear Casey Hallas, the band’s
newest bass player, isn't bothered a bit.
“I'm the bassist for the band at least
through this semester," said Hallas, “1’ ve
considered u'ansl'en-ing, though. No. I
seem to be dotng alright Maybe it’s
because I'm not living me Jon Hendrick
Project."

Hallas's entrance into the band was
marked by the humor and general infor-
mality oi The Jon Heinrich Proyect
“When Casey played in Gardner, he Just
showedup,"saithcNamard “We‘relikc

‘hey, you want to play with us?‘ It was
about twenty minutes before we were
about to play."

The new member blended right into
the band, even without pmcu'oe, The Jon
Hendrick Prty'ecrmostlyimprovisestheir
live songs, seeingitasamoiecomfonzble
altemativctodecldingbeforehand whatto
play and how to play it.

‘We don’tplay alongasetstylc. We

placu'cesongs,butweneversticktothem,"
said sophomore Bill Eichmann (guitar).

“It seems like we play better when
we improvise," added McNamara, ”bar
causewe aren’t allskjlled musicians who
are gotng to play tikethismany measures,
and go to the bridge and do this. Most
people know that we're pretty inexperi-
enced musicians arldthatwe‘rejustb’ying
to have fun. They don‘t mind getting
drunk to us."

Hallas explained his perception or
theband’sidenti'ty. “Itendrothinkofthe
bandasfunny. It‘s notajoke,itsfunny. lts
freedom we just get up there and see
what happens There rs no rear oireally
making mistakes because essentially its
all a mistake."

This informal improv style exe
plains the band's lack of lyrics (they
structure a song too much) and their
love for distonion pedals (to play
around with). The band believes that
effects pedals help groups that don’t
have much nrusicai experience, The
Jon Hrrrdric/r Project members have
been playing theirinstruments for only
a year or two.

The Jon Hendrick Project is
named after Grinnell junior Jon
llcndnch. “We just knew rirat ire
would ger really pissed if someone
nealned a band after him, so we named
zi band after him,” said Eichmann.

“He would be the last guy you'd
ever imagine a band named after," said
l-lutchison. “Or the last guy you’d ever
imagineinourband,"added McNamara,

Thelon Hendrick Project will be
around for two moreycars. Keepinga
bassistthat long is anotherquestion, of
course. They plan to play in Younker
before the semester is over, The band
expressed thanks to groups such as the
Hypocrites and Hip Hop LizAt-d tor
their support.
