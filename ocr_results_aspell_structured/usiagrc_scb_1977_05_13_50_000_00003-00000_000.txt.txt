I suspect that many people will
think an essay about the SGA
budget is a somewhat mundane
occupant of this previously pon-
derous column, I agree, and would
refrain from writing one, were it
not for the simple and awful
magnitude of the SGA’s budget.

claws of the SGA, which devours
them ravenously.

The process by which money is
dispensed is also of interest.
Ostensibly, the initial budget is
drawn up by the finance committee
of the Joint Bored (sic). ($65
question: do YOU know why they
call it the Joint Board?) I might
add that the finance committee
was only recently discovered. It
had previously been hibernating
and the SGA president kept the 82
grand in his pocket, doling it out
when she got drunk. None of that
now. Anyway, the finance com.
mittee's recommendation goes to
the Joint Board,‘ which maka
amendments and votes on it.
That‘s one way to describe it.

Here‘s another way: a debacle
closely resembling a pack of
slavering hyenas going after a
dead possum. i think that the
budgets of the past two years have
been ior the most part reasonable
and just, but I can‘t for the life of
meligure outhow they managed to
extract a good budget from the
dogfight going on over it. (KDIC
once presented a request for
313,000. They asked for 35,000 this
time.) Only the faculty can offer a
spectacle of greed and selfrinterest
equal to a budget meeting.

My only complaint about Unis
year’s budget is that it was not
used creatively. We could buy each
student a share in some all com
pany and then pack the
stockholder’s meeting. We could
establish a fund for dead Chilean
teamsters. We could speculate in
land. We could all go to Vegas, We
could buy the Cottontail Ranch, We
could spend all 82 thou for a Rolling
Stones concert here, videotape it,
and then replay the tape in Roberts
every weekend. Really a lot Sims
pler than the present social ac
tivities. We could not. by the way,
spend any of it on legal expenses
for students busted on drug
charges. If We didn't agree with the
firing ofsome particular professor,
we could hire him ourselves and let
hlm teach in the SGA office.
There‘d be no question about
student input into hiring them.

Or we could just give it all back
to ourselves.

Where’s the controversy?

by Wade Lee

In the interests of principle I add
yet another article concerning the
EPCs at Grinnell. I make no
pretense either of knowing all of
the “facts” about all of the
departmental EPCs at Grinnell, or
of having access to all of the “in‘s
and out's" of the politics which
Surround Grinnell's latest cons
troveisy. I do claim to know the
situation in the economics
department. I am also aware that
there are those who have been led
to believe that the economics EPC
Should be bunched into that class of
EPCS “which have had trouble
with the faculty.” Their set of
facts, however, differs from mine.

My iacs are based upon my
experiences as a two year member
and present chairman of the
economics EPC. I don‘t deny that
there have been problems, A quick
glance at departmental offerings
for the upcoming year certainly
reflects the existence of problems.
But Sorry, student “politicians"
and “enthusiasts”: the problems
which we encountered have had
nothing to do with being written off
or ignored by the faculty. Rather,
they were basically a function of a
relatively strong market for
economrss and a decision by the
faculty (concurred upon by the
cool not to forage quality in filling
recent single and two year
openings.

Let's consider the facts.
Requests by Clifford Reid to ex~
tend his leave through the 1977-78
academic year and by Steve and
Pat Brenner to participate in the
London Program for the 1973-79
academic year left a two year
position to be filled. The departs
mentinterviewed 27 candidates for

this position over the Winter break.
Each of the top four candidates
who considered Grinnell ac-
ceptable, and were also considered
acceptable by the faculty, was
brought to Grinnell and in
terviewed by, among others, the
student EPC. In all cases, the EPC
members were provided with the
particular candidate's curriculum
vitae, Only in the first instance was
a formal colloquium not giver. by
the candidate. Upon the sub-
sequent request by the EPC, all
other candidates gave formal
presentations.

The EPC found all of these
candidates quite acceptable, and
ranked them in order of
preference. Our third choice had
effectively priced himself out of
consideration. Our first choice had
indicated to the faculty that he
would only grudgingly teach in-
troductory and lower level courses,
that he had been made another
offer, and could not even consider a
Grinnell offer for a considerable
period of time. The first offer went
to the EPC’S second choice. He
turned It down The EPC’S fourth
choice was then given an offer,
which he also refused, Both had
opted for permanent positions
elsewhere, (Our first and third
choices later revealed that they,
too, had accepted permanent of-
fers.)

Shortly afterward, Mr, Steven
Gardner, a previously uninterested
candidate who had been rated
favorably by the faculty, and Mr.
John Martens, a new entry in the
pool ot applicants, were brought to
campus, The EPC again found the
candidates acceptable, but was
not, as a unit, able to provide a
clear preference, Martens offered
a particularly enthusiastic and
dynamic approach, but no teaching
experience and a relatively thin
background in economics. Gard-
ner, though lacking Martens'
dynamism, was clearly superior in
terms of teaching experience and
background in economics. After
considerable deliberation, the
faculty opted for Gardner, and
Gardner accepted the offer

But where‘s the controversy7
Sorry, “activists"; it was a
professional decision. I find no
evidence here of myself or the EPC
having been ignored or written off
by the faculty. ,

Shortly after spring break, Mr
Dawson requested and was
granted a sabbatical leave for the
upcoming academic year. Several
candidates were considered and
contacted but only one consented to
be interviewed for the one year

position, The candidate was given
an offer, but rejected it in favor of
a more promising alternative. The
position has not, and probably will
not, be filled. Sufficient time was
simply not given to find a well
qualified economist willing to
forego preferable alternatives in
the market for a slngle year
position,

Herein lies the problem. Official
requests for (and approval of)
leaves of absence and extensions of
leaves of absence have been so ill~
timed and have occurred at such
relatively late stages in the game
(Le. December and March in
Reid’s and Dawson's respective
cases) that some degree of inef.
ficiency and inadequacy in hiring
procedures was almost
unavoidable. (A department
cannot begin to search for a
replacement until the request for a
leave has been officially ap—
proved.) The result in this case is
apparent departmental instability
anda relatively meager offering of
200 level Courses. But who's to
bless and who's to blame? The
EPC neither wants the former nor
deserves the latter. But is Clifford
Reid, or Jack Dawson, to be
condemned for allowing personal
motivations to override departs
mental interests? or is, perhaps,
the EPC and student input supr
posed to be able to intervene and
regulate a professor's career or
personal interests? (Who, then
regulates the EPC'?)

Play all the games you wish and
grab onto all that student power
you can get (though I doubt that
you know what you have) but.
please, when available, rely on
facts rather than extrapolation to
make your points.
