Jesse Macy
Club Disbands

"The Jesse Macy club has discon-
tinued separate existence for the
tlllluLioxi,‘ Catheiine Funk, press
idcnt of the club announced to-
day, “Meinbels of the Jesse Ma-
cy club will join the Post War
Seminar," Mi s Funk said, “with
a provision that when the war is
over. the students and advisors of
that seminar see that the Jesse
Macy club will be I‘t‘smaugul‘ated."

It was thought wise that the two
groups he coinliined since both
discuss the same copies and the
Post War Seminar was the ins-
Jorlty group.
