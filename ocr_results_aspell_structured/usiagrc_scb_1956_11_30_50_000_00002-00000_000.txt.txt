1/3 Of 1 Voice

A letter appearing elsewhere on this page concerns a
subject that has often puzzled us. Journalism at Grinnell is
free from prior censorship. We can take great pride that the
three publicationsithe Scarlet and Black, Maverick and
Cyclone—are run completely by students. Paradoxically, the
publications have no direct voice in their affairs.

All publications are under the Committee on Student
Publications. On this committee there are [our faculty votes,
one administration vote and four student votes. These stu-
dent votes go to a member of the Council of House Presi-
dents, a member of the League Board and the president of
the Student Council. The one remaining Vote is split be-
tween six people, the editor and business managers of the
three publications. Each publication has 1/3 of 1 vote. out
of nine votes.

We don’t object to the administration and faculty hav-
ing a one-vote margin over students However, We do feel
that student representation is unfair. In a committee on
publications, each publication should know more about its
problems than other members, and should have more than
1A; of one vote.

Two members represent the C of HP and League
Board. We wonder why there should be three students rep-
resenting student government. It seems that student gov-
ernment, in the form of C of HP and League Board, is not
a voice of the students If there are three students, why
not have three students representing the students, and not
representing special interest groups?

A reason for the reorganization of the committee two
years ago was that if the publications had control of the
committee, they could perpetuate themselves. This means
that a group of like-minded individuals could control publi~
cations for a number of years. This shows little confidence
in the integrity of responsible people, and little thought into
the true situation.

The incumbent publications heads may make recommen-
dations, not binding on the committee, as to their successors
Even without recommendations, they can make it virtually
impossible for an undesirable person to be editor. Staff
heads choose all of their assistants, and assign positions on
the staff. If they wish, they can ignore ability and interest
when picking assistants, and concentrate only on picking
like-minded people. In this way, it would be impossible for
interested people to get experience leading to a responsible
position.

We are not implying’that the personality makeup of
the present committee is unsympathetic to publications. We
are not implying that there is at present an incompetent
committee, or that any clash has arisen this year. We are
only stating that publications do not have a big enough vote
in affairs, and that special interest groups such as the Lea-
gue Board and C of HP have no place in a committee on l
student publications. If publications are the voice of the
students, they should also have a Voice on their committee.
If publications are the voice of the students, the students,
should have a better voice on the committee than two special -
interest groups.

SCARLET AND BLACK

Sackclolh
And
Ashes

By Gene Thompson

When I think about women's
government on the Grinnell
campus: ‘

I imagine dozens of nice little
girls going to dozcns of nice
little mccnngs . .

They come up with dozens of
nice little ideas, like playing
Santa Claus with student funds

(“Merry Christmas. house-
mothers! Here are your 1956
Christmas presentsewe love
you all equally, and we have
the sales slips to prove iwl
They form nice little opinions
that are socially acceptable any—
where, but that reflect no inc
dividuality, no spontaneity and
very little thought.

Then these opinions are justi~
fled in a body known as the
“mass meeting" (”I dreamed i
went to a mass meeting in my
Maidcnform opinion . . . ’l)

Ideas are jealously guarded
from the influence of “wrong-
thinkers” by a system of social
pressures and prejudices that
makes the early Puritans look
like novices. No one dares to
criticize openly for fear of the
cold, icy stare of those who are
in an official position to smear
reputations, start rumors or
make irresponsible entries on
permanent record cards. All this
leads one faculty member to far
fer to the League Board as a
“vicious system."

At the Sam time, the work-
ings of wnmen‘s government
are clouded in secrecy for fear
someone who isn't contented
with the system, or someone
outside the clutches of the
system might expose it to
general ridicule.

A Scarlet and Black reporter,
for instance, doesn‘t have a
chance when it comes to getting
any intelligent facts about the
actions of women’s government.

How about a “coffee hour" on
women’s government? Can south
campus trust the system to jus-
tify itself in an open discussion?

somebody ought to be both-
ered enough by the above
charges to do something about
it. I don’t think they arc ir-
responsible charges—they are

To The Editor:

Consumption runs rampant,
Due to certain conditions im-
posed upon the women of the
quad, 1 find it imperative to
speak out against study hall in
James basement. It should and
could be improved.

The first phrase wns placed
in this letter because the proc-
tor had a bad cold on Monday
night and now 1 feel as if i have
TB as a result,

The lights are too indirect,
the ventilating system must
have been abandoned in 1919.
Persons leaving this lively
place are physically incapable
of indulging in further study.

If measures are to be taken
against the women, why not
have them study in the library,
or confine them to their rooms?

To The Editor:

Success of anything depends
on the cooperation and support
of the people behind it, The
World University Service auc-
tion dance was a success * a
huge success—and it is to those
who so thoroughly gave their
support that we would like to
express our sincere apprecia-
tion.

The faculty families willingly
contributed pies, cakes, cookies,
parties, dinners and tutoring.

IRC, Men’s and Women’s
Honor G, the YWCA, the So»
clal Coordinating committee,
WRA, Friars and the Board
of Religion 1cm much support
in sponsoring booths.

Mr. D. “lard, the auctioneer,
gave forth much time and ef»
fort to maintain the highest
bidding possible.

John McClenon’s band pro-
vided excellent music for danc»
inz.

The students, from whom
most of the money came, coop-
erated fully and were a leading
factor in the evening’s enjoy-
merit.

We want to say “thank you"
to everyone who helped. We
hope that next semester you will
again give us your support

made because there are people
on the campus who would like
to see some discussion.
What’s wrong with the Grin-
nell woman when she has to
resort to a beast that she can
change a tire in order to justify
her existence in the Grinncll
Community? Whatever happened
to the spirit of the “bedrcheck

revolt”?

To the Editor:

in setting up a Committee on
Student Publications, the as~
sumption exists that there is a
necessary and important func-
tion which such a group may
perform. This function is, pre-
sumably, supervision of the
maintenance of journalistic ex-
ccllence and good taste.

It is the purpose of this let-
ter to suggest that the Commit
tee, under Its present organiza-
tion, assumes certain powers
which it should not be entrust-
ed with, and falls to take ad
vantage of some of the powers
which it rightly possesses.

Voting membelship on the
Committee is currently com-
posed of nine people who
have been elected and/or ap-
pointed because of the variety
of special interests which they
represent and must seek to
protect.

Therefore, when an issue is
‘introduccd, a meeting necessarc
ily becomes an arena in which
the faction with the largﬁt at
tendance for the clay wins out
over the others.

I contend that there is no
mom in a committee of this
sort for special interests. Ev-
erynne involved is obviously
interested in the best news-
paper, the best yearbook, the
best magazine possible.

There is only one goal; and
there is only one set of actions
which leads to its achievement.
The “Special interests" of a su-
perior publication can be served
only by a group which is free
from outside connections which
limit the exercise of its better
judgment. -

Yours truly,
Susan Berne,
Non-voting member,
Committee on Student
Publications.
