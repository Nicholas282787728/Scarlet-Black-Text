Netsnyahu, King Hussein in Surprise Talks

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and King
Hussein of Jordan met Thursday for surprise talks in the
southern Israeli resort of Eilat.

Ofﬁcials from both countries conﬁrmed the talks were
under way but had no immediate details on what was
being discussed.

The meeting at a hotel in Eilat was their ﬁrst since Israel
sent Mossad secret service agents to Amman last Sep—
tember on a botched mission to assassinate a leading
member of the militant Palestinian movement Hamas,
“There is a meeting going on in Eilat,“ Netanyahu’s
spokesman Shai Bazak said. He said details of the dis-
cussions would be released later Thursday. ' ‘
Last year‘s failed Mossad attempt to kill Khaled Meshal,
a Hamas political leader, severely strained relations be-
tween Israel and Jordan, which signed a peace treaty in
October 1994.

The two neighbors patched up their differences over the
affair at talks in Tel Aviv last month between Netanyahu
and Jordan’s Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein’s
brother.

 

Botha ’Irial Postponed; Botha Angry

The trial of fon'ner South African president P.W. Botha
on charges of ignoring a subpoena to appear before the
country’s truth commission was postponed Thursday

until June 1.
The postponement was granted against the wishes of

Botha, 82, whose lawyer told the court that the delay
was “totally unacceptable because it will result in unA
tested allegations being sent out into the world."

Botha has been appearing on charges of ignoring a sub
poena to appear before the statutory Truth and Recon-
ciliation Commission, which wants to question him over
claims that his government knowingly tenured and killed
anti-apanheid activists.

Botha was overheard telling his legal team that he thought
the case should proceed. ”This case was set down for
four days. Come, let's go on," Botha said.

The case was originally scheduled to end Friday. but
delays resulting from last-minute talks between Botha
and the truth commission resulted in the court running
out of time.

The court said the next available slot was from June 1 to
June 5 and the case would resume then.

U.S.: NATO Will Arrest War Criminal Suspects
NATO troops in Bosnia are not engaged 'in a “witch4
hunt" for indicted war criminals but will arrest any they
ﬁnd, including former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic, U.S. joint chiefs of staff chairman Henry
Shelton said Thursday.

”Those persons that have been indicted for war crimes
belong in The Hague, they (should) stand trial and be
judged by that apparatus," Shelton said, referring to the
United Nations war crimes tribunal in the Dutch city.
The mandate of the U.S. and other NATO forces de-
ployed in Bosnia requires that they pick up persons in-
dicted for war crimes and transport them to The Hague
for trial, he told a news conference in Copenhagen.

He said the mandate also covered Karadzic, who was
reported by Bosnian media Thursday to be staying in
the eastern Bosnian town of Visegrad, having previously
lived in hiding near the village of Pale, close to Sarajevo.
All members of the NATO forces in Bosnia understood
the war criminals mandate, Shelton said.

“We have not turned it into a witch-hunt where we are
out looking for individuals but we certainly...look for
signs that they may be in a particular area. And if in fact
we come in contact with them, then we plan to arrest
'them or to detain them and transport them to The Hague."
he said.

“And that includes Karadzic, since he is a person that
has been indicted," Shelton added.

BY SARAH REINHARD

AND MOLLY GARDNER
Staff Writers

Students met yesterday with Director
of the Career Development Ofﬁce Steve
Langerud and Associate Director of Ad-
missions Karen Kristof to discuss what
issues they hope to address at the ques-
tionaand-answer sessions with presidenv
tial candidates next week.

These sessions are pan of an extensive
search process the college is undergoing
in recruiting a new president.

The Presidential Search Committee
began to plan interviews in February, with
aid from the Heidrick & Struggles search
firm In soliciting applications.

Over the past two months candidates
have been screened and inteIVIewed for
the presidential position.

No hundred and ﬁfty nominees and
applicants are ofﬁcially being considered.
Next week, between three and ﬁve can—
didates will visit Grinnell, with more of
the ﬁnalists to visit in coming weeks.

The Search Committee has drafted a

tentative schedule forthe candidates‘ vis-
its. Included in each schedule are meet-
ings, receptions, and tours intended to fa-
miliarize the candidates with the college
and with the campus community, '

The ﬁrst candidate to visit, Dr. Ellen
Hurwitz of Albright College, will arrive
in Grinnell on Sunday.

Upon amval, she will attend an infor-
mal reception at Harris at 7:15 Sunday

night, Activities during the next few days ,

will include a lunch with the Executive
Council and a meeting at Windsor House
with SGA.

In addition, Hurwitz will host a ques»
tionrandranswer session for students in
the Fomm South Lounge.

Preparation for this session was the
focus ofyesterday's meeting with Kristof
and Langerud, who both emphasized the
importance of student input.

While only eight students attended
Thursday’s preparatory meeting, enthu—
siasm and participation levels were high.

With Kristof and Langerud, students
brainstormed issues and concerns they felt
were important to address in the sessions

Restaurant rumor proves false

BY MOLLY GARDNER
Staff Writer

The rumors are false: presently, no
new fast food restaurants are scheduled
for construction in Grinnell. However,
development is a continuous process a
one in which both outside businesses and
Grinnell community play active roles.

As recently as in the past two weeks.
the Grinnell Chamber of Commerce has
contacted fast food establishments to ex-
change information about real estate
availability and commercial activity. “We
work with them, get them to visit, We
show them locations that might work for
them, and we let them know when com~
mercial properties come up for sale,~1' said
Terry Walker, the Economic Development
Coordinator for the Chamber of Comv
merce.

So far, no one has committed. But this
does not necessarily show a lack ofinter-
est,

“McDonald’s has been studying sevA
eral areas in Grinnell for quite some time
now,” said Ginny Blattert, the owner and
operator of the McDonald‘s in Newton.
Blattert cited several factors the corpora
tion considers when deciding whether to
move into a new location, including trafv
ﬁc patterns, current competition, and real
estate prices. Also, McDonald’s is inter-
ested in “retail draw,” an inadvertent mea-
sure of surrounding population based on
the number of customers who patronize

Grinnell businesses.

According to Walker, the largest obr
stacle for most businesses who wish to
locate in Grinnell is real estate availabilr
in: “Population is not an issue
anymore...It’s a matter of available loca
tion.” One prime spot for restaurants is
the comer of 1-46 and 6. However, most
ofthis land is already owned. Still, there
are other spots along the interstate that
Walker and company are “anxious to de~
velop." TWo weeks ago, representatives
from an unnamed restaurant business took
trafﬁc counts near the junction of 1-46 and
the interstate. Such trafﬁc monitoring has

Students who attended
felt it was important for
each candidate to present
their vision of Grinnell‘s
future as one that promoted
change and improvement
while remaining true to the
college's unique core val-
ues.

way that their past experi-

ences are addressed. By discussing par~
ticularsituations, actions, and results, they
will give interviewers a better idea of their
experience and commitment.

With this perspective in mind, students
drafted ﬁve core questions to raise at each
question-and-answer session next week.

Initially. students plan to ask why each
candidate chose Grinnell. They hope to
elicit a response that involves diveIsity,
quality of teaching, and selfrgovernance.

Students were also interested in learn-

ing each candidate’s view of what
Grinnell should become.

In addition, students felt that the can-
didates should be able to talk about their
past involvement with multiculturalism
and to give evidence of their commitment
to fostering healthy town-gown relations.

Also emphasized was the issue of self-
governance. Students thought it was im-
portant that a president help students
properly take advantage of this privilege,

African Program Debuts

BY YASUKO TAOKA
Staff Writer

Next fall, two Grinnell graduates will
travel to Lesotho to teach high school for
a year as pan of the Southern African
Teaching Fellows Program. The pilot pro—
gram is “to give Grinnell graduates a very
meaningful experience. . .and the oppor-
tunity to make a contribution," said Pro-
fessor George Drake, director of the pro-
gram.

In December, the two chosen gradu-
ates will uavel to Lesotho, a small Afri-
can country surrounded by South Africa.
The graduates will teach English, Science,
or Mathematics at St. Rodrigue High
School, a Catholic mission girls‘ school
of 400 students.

St. Rodrigue High School was founded
by an order of nuns whose speciﬁc pur-
pose was to aid women. Although stu-
dents must pay for school in Lesotho. St.
Rodrigue keeps its fees low. in order to
allow more children to attend school.

The two Teaching Fellows will be cho-
sen Ihrough an application process which
will conclude late next week. Applications
are due April 20, and interviews will take
place on April 22. One of the two slots
has already been filled by Jessica
Kimelman ‘98.

Kimelman, along with 6 other students,
went to Lesotho last summer in an over-
seas community involvement internship
funded by the Hewlett Foundation. The

idea for the Southern Africa program
originated from that summer intemship.

Last summer, the Grinnellians naught
the students in preparation for the Cam-
bridge Overseas School Oertiﬁcate ex-
amination. Although the exams are dif-
ﬁcult and few pass, Kimelman was im-
pressed that “they wanted to learn so
badly."

Kimelman developed a strong bond
with her students from last summer.
Those students will be in their last year
when Kimelman returns this fall. She
said that she is returning next year to “flu-
ish what [she] staned." Kimelman con-
tinued, “I want them to pass. . .5 weeks
trying to help them pass their exams
wasn’t enough for me:" She feels that
there is more that she can do.

The remaining slot will be ﬁlled by a
graduate who is “energetic, can commu-
nicate clearly, hardworking. . .and open
to and embracing the newness of the situ-
ation," described Drake. He explained,
“Interacting with the (different] culture
requires sensitivity and patience."

Upon their return, the two Teaching
Fellows will talk with Grinnell students
and faculty about their experience.

The Southern Africa Teaching Fellows
Program is modeled on the Nanjing Fel-
lows Program, which sends two Grinnell
graduates to China each year. Drake
hopes that the Southem African Program
will be sirrtilarly extended into an ongo-
ing program.

Africana Studies Conference Examines ‘Race’

BY DAVID NATHAN
Staff Writer

Over 150 Grinnell students and faculty
attended the Second Annual Africana
Studies conference Wednesday.

Professor Katya Gibel Azoulay, Chair
ofGrinnell’sAfricana Studies concentra-
tion and Assistant Dean of StudentAffairs
Siclinda Cantvalliott organized the con-
ference.

“I‘ thought it was very well received,"
Said Gibel Azoulay. “I was impressed
with the presenters. The students did
magnificently...For the second time,
Africana Studies has facililated an envi-
ronment in which students could present
in an academic manner as they would in
any professional conference." Gibel
AZoulay said she felt the conference had
a lasting effect. “Having a conference is
important because it leads to discussion
and intellectual growth,” she Commented.

“There are questions that we must raise
when we see race depicted in the press
and experience it in ourdaily lives," said
Gibel Azoulay. “Race is socially con
structed; it is invented, yet this legacy
impacts on current political and economic
trends and shapes racializcd representa-
tions of information in the media. For
example, we often hear about black on
black violence in South Africa, but not
about while on white violence in Croatia
or Belfast.

“One of the important contributions of

people cannot separate “race” into a single

theories which labeled some groups as
other’, " she said.

“I'm going to call it the ﬁnal frontier,"
said Professor of American Studies and
Sociology Kesho Scott, “The ﬁnal acar
demic frontier is relating issues of race
and gender and sexuality to the sciences
and there are a lot of myths and bridges
we’re going to have to cross when we
begin to ask questions about how science
is constructed when it presents itself as
race and class and sexuality neutral.
We’re going to have to get over some of

those mentalities. We know, for example,
that science is not race blind. Funding
for science projects is not race blind.
How scientists create conclusions is not
race blind. WhatI think is exciting about
this conference is that it will be address-
ing interdisciplinary investigation into
the issue of race."

Gibel Azoulay and Canty—Elliott is-
sued a request for papers ﬁrst semester.

“Many professors went out of their
'way to help students develop and enrich
papers," said Gibel Azoulay. “These
weren’t graded assignments; students had
more of an opportunity to reﬁne their
work and speak their mind."

Grinnell’s First Annual African Stud-
ies Conference was held last year on
April 23 in the Forum. Its appearance
was made possible by hard work and
dedication.

“Katya and I had a vision," said
Canty-Elliott, “to further the cause of
multiculturalism outside of the classroom
and so we got together and talked about
Africana studies. A lot of individuals
came forward and said ‘why are you do-
ing this?’, ‘It isn't necessary,‘ ‘people
won’t participate,‘ but Katya and I, be-
ing the people that we are, were visionA
aries and saw a bigger picture. As a re-
sult of that collaboration, she and I did a
number of things in getting the confer-
ence recognized by various groups, in-
cluding public relations, with my con-
