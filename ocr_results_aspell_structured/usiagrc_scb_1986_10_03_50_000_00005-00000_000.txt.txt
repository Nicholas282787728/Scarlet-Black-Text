Health Center. According to Daniels. these
problems Include difficulty coping with

Eressure. and unresolved conﬂicts from

problems. or others of a lnental health
nature, the Center is the place to call for
help.

Daniels says lhzit over hallol' the student

members of the College administration. In

lege and Center, “If the student or the staff

Expose Yourself to Tray Art

By h'arin Seriestroin

I would like to: if I may. dedicate this are
licle to my sixteenryearrold brother, John,
who will no doubt enjoy something oil-the-
wall like this when he reads it back home
in Michigan.

"tray : canvas,”

How many of you dedicated Grinnell Col-
lege Food Service diners have seen that on
one oi your trays? Ever wonder what witty
sayings you've missed? or what the GCFS
stall thinks about 7 TRAY GRAFFITI?

I spent over two hours in Cowles' and
Quad's kitchens painstakingly looking at
every single tray and jotting down the wit
ticisms In my little notebook. I regret that
none of the wonderful artistic drawings
that appear on Grinnell College cafeteria
trays can be reproduced here. but life is
tough all over.

I managed to get some comments from
both kitchens, although no one actually
wanted to go “on the record" as being the
one who made them.

At Cowles. l was told with a shrug that,
"There's been graffiti forever." Someone

less tolerant said, “Tell them to carve iton
their foreheads." But they agreed with
what was said at Quad: tray graffiti at
Grinnell is “part or a larger problem oi
vandalism, and just remember. your
board and tuition fee goes up every time
we have to buy new trays.“ Also, to all of
you who wonder why it's very rare to see a
tray with an obscenity on it. it's because
they get pulled. So don't bother,

"It's a beautiful tray in the
neighborhood. . , ” Oh. sorry. Just humm-
ing a little ditty I saw on my tray today. I
guess there are a lot or musical people out
there, because not only has it been ‘A Hard
Tray's Night." but you can see “a Trays a
Week” 7 “Tray By Tray”! Wow! One
tray, I mean, day. l saw “That'll Be The
Tray "Tomorrow is only a tray away”,

trangers in the night." Boy, “What
A Tray That Was." I almost became a
"Tray Tripper”. but instead I just shook
my head and said "Strange trays indeed"
For all you Pink Floyd fans, there is “I
Have Become Comfortably Numb”. or
maybe that‘s a reaction to the loud. Talk-

tray . , And my personal favorite {or
starting the week e "Another Pleasant
Valley Quad Tray . . "

At first I wasn't sure it I wanted to do
this article. but then I figured I'd give it
"the old college tray". Idecided to “make
tray while the sun shines" and take it “one
tray at a time." So I went out and worked
on it for “40 trays and 40 nights" until I
was asking “what tray is it?” I knew the
"tray olreckoning“ (read: deadline) was
coming up and that my “trays were
numbered.“ so I said to myself, "II at ﬁrst
you don't succeed, tray tray again!" It
was as it someone had said to me. ”Go
Ahead, Make My Tray.” I knew I was done
When I went to breaklast one day and saw
“This is your lucky tray!" My lriends told
me "Tray to go!" and I modestly replied,
"All in a tray‘s work." “By Tray!”

In history we were studying tailed invae
sions, and we learned about Kennedy and
the "Tray of Figs." But I like FDR
because alter Pearl Harbor was bombed
he said “This tray shall live in infamy. .
Also I was reading a tray the other day and
it said “Those traysayers. who would
have us mean what we tray and tray what
we mean . , . thonald WrongsAgain)” Oh
well. “these are the trays that try men's
souls,”

Two oi my lavorite old movies are “The
Tray We Were" and "Tray Lady Down”,
the one about the submarine. (But my
brother liked “Tray ol the Living Dead"
better) I also like ‘Casablanca", especialr
ly when Bogie says “Tray it again. Sam."
My mom watches soap operas every once
in awhile and we always know when
because we will hear “Like sand through
the hourglass. so are the trays oi our
lives " By the way, “this tray is closed
captioned lor the hearing impaired."

Grinnellians like to comment (or in
some cases, warn) about the food in the
cafeterias. For example. you had better
“EAT CHEESE OR DIEI”, but “don't eat
the ravioli.” It would also be a good idea to
wear rubber shoes so you don‘t get elec-
trocuted by the "Electric Milk ln Cowles."
tSort of makes you wonder about the cow it
came from ) We are also informed. in both
cafeterias, that “RC is the one true cola"
and in Quad, that ”wow. this tea is really
brisk.” Speaking or beverages. someone
took a poll, and the score was “Milk (13)
VS. Beer (6)." Must not have been around
Relays time. Finally, there is a plaintive
cry for nourishment 7 “I WANNA A
