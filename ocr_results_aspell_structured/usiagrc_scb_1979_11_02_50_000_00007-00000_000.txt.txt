a trophy at 2:30 Sunday aiternoon,
looking iorward to the weckrlong
break ahead—very satisfied with our
accomplishments. “But wait," I said,
“it we play one more game today we
Can Win’ the tournament! ” The team
members stared at me with extremely
diverse looks in their eyes,
Somewhere I sensed a wanting ate
titude of winning from them, I don't
know where it came from, maybe I
was just imagining it. Even though we
had already played three games and
three tiebreaking play-offs, our team
said, “Okay coach, we'll try again.”
At this time, I knew there was
nothing else i could tell my team.
They were tired, some injured, others
completely drained from the stress of
winning all day, How could I possibly
ask them to will again? I'm coaching
at Grinnell College—remember that
Merl‘y—, this is Grinnell, What words
at this point could be at all meaningful
as a motivational factor in encourage
ing the Grinnell tield hockey team to
win a championship game? They have
never faced this situation before, I’ve
already told them they could Win on a
muddy field, a dry field, take a
shower before a game, and not take a
shower before a game What’s left?!
As coach, I am faced with a dilcmr
ma, I proceeded to place myself in
their situation I decided that I must
tell my team about ”sterncl‘ stuff.”
“Sterner stuff" is that part that’s
left inside when an athlete feels every
possible physical and mental part of
the body has been used, I knew my
team was at that point, but we had to
play in the championship game in five
minutes and my ”sterner stuff" lec-
ture takes longer than flve minutes.
The only motivationl talk I had left in
me was my “sterner stuff" lecture.
Tlme was running out What shall]
do?
At this point it finally hit me that

this team would have to discover
“sterner stuff" on their own. If these
lield hockey players had anything left
in them, it would come out whether
they won or lost and I, as coach, was
ready to judge whether or not they
had enough strength left to display
“sterner stuff.”

As I drove our team home in the
van, I frequently glanced at our

time Grinnell College coach and

Self discovery is a real education;
