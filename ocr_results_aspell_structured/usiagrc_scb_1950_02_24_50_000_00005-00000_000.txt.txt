was scored Saturday as Dave
hell to a 91770 win over Knox,

“The games last weekend
went according to plan,” smiledi
Pfitsch. “We knew that Coe
would try to work out a de
fense that would stop our usuali
slow break style, so we decid-
ed to run Friday. I was welli
satisiied with, the results. We
kept a commanding lead,, and
the game gave us a good cliancei
to work on this new system.”

Bigelow Hot, Too

”I'm not trying to take any-
thing away trom Dave’s scoring
record or his all—round play in
the Knox game,” Pfitsch contlnv‘
ued. “but don’t overlook the exe
cellent game that Bob Bigelow
turned in. The squad as a whole
played one of its best games,
but Bob’s rebounding and pass-
ing was exceptional."

Pfitsch commented that the
fast break used in the Coe:
game was partly responsible for
Dunlop’s scoring only eight
points in the contest. “Dave,
was taking defensive rebounds
rather than breaking, resulting,
in the rest of the team scoring
more points while Dave scored
fewer”

Dunlop’s points against
Knox broke the big blond's
own single game varsity record
of 81 points scored in the
Christmas tournament this seen
so it also broke the fieldhouse‘
m of 30 points set by Bob
Williamson, a Pioneer star in
1945-46.

Shatter '06 Record

The 91 point game total shat—
tered a record that was set in
1906. Those Pioneers of the
past racked up 73 points against‘
Leander Clark, and until lasti
Saturday, no Grinnell cage
team had topped the mark

The weekend wins tied ans
other record as the Pioneers
took their seventh straight
league victory. Since entering
the Midwest conference Grinnell
has never won more than seven
loop contests in a row, a mark
which could be shattered
against Carleton tomorrow
night.

Mermen Win 2nd ‘-

er Augustana;
arls Next Foe

The Pioneer swimming team
extended its winning streak to
two games in dumping the Aug-
ustana mermen 43.27. Grinneu
finished its dual meet swim-
ming season against Cornell
yesterday. All that remains is
the crucial eonierence meet at
Northtield, Minn.

On Saturday Pioneer fans saw
Jack Edgren break two pool
records to lead the Grinnell
tankers to an easy 43-27 tri-
umph. Edgren set a new pool
mark in the 2ZO-yd. free style
with a time of two minutes 22
seconds and came back even
stronger to knock 2.2 seconds
off the old IUD-yd. tree style
standard.

Other individual firsts were
pocketed by Risse in the back
stroke. Neilson in the breast,
'Jessen in the 440 and Kingery
who just edged his zeamamate
Jim Brown in the diving. Zeit-
ler and Jessen garnered seconds
as did Frank who returned to
action for the first time in two
weeks. Mimack added to the
Scarlet and Black’s total score
with a third in the breast
stroke

In Season Tilis

Coach EG Booth's freshman
cage squad ended their season
last Saturday with an easy 51a
35 Victory over the Coe preps.
raced by Dave Stumbaugh’s
15 points, the yearlings brought
their season record to two wins
against a pair of losses.

“Any player on the freshman
squad may be able to develop
into varsity material asserted
Booth. “However, with sports
getting back to normal after
the war it takes a really ex-
ceptional player to win a start
ing position his sophomore year,
if the members of this year’s
freshman team are, willing to
kep working next season, even
if they don't get much game
time, they are apt to be holding
down starting positions as juna
me and seniors."

Leading scorer on this year's
freshman squad was Dave Stum—
haugh, with an average of 13.3
points in four games. Other
team scoring leaders were Gard-
iner Dutton, with an average of
123; Dick Simester, 9.5; Bob
Dibble, 6; George Whitehill, 4.5;
and Harvey Golden, 4.25 points.

The other members of the
squad were .lim Robertsonﬂart»
ley Bond, Terry Ellis, Mitchel
Weisel, Dee Renwick, Hank
Cochran, Harry West, and Don
Glickman.

The yearlings won both of
their home contests this season
