Velvet Underground

Part3

by John potts

Each Velvet Underground album
has been Very distinctive. The 56,
cond sounded different from the
first, and the third certainly sounds
very different from either of the
first two. Loaded combines the Very
best elements from all three: the
lyrical quality ol the lirst and third,
the vocal arrangements and drive
of the second, and the full rich ton-
ality of the third. Gone are the teds
ious esoteric experiments which
spiced the earlier albums and the
Underground is displaying surpris—
ingly new Complexity in theirarrans
gemehts. Electronic ellectsaredis-
tinguishable only because they fit in
so well, and the overal sound of
the album is Justexcellenl. Tlleband
is in top form; Lou Reed’s Vocals
are his best; and the material ems
braces some of Lou Reed‘s best,
most complex lyrical sojourns.

The songs on Leaded are much
more than merely good rock poe»
try. The album as a whole is a
single thematic entity. Most of the
songs deal with people living life,
and, for the most part, serve as a
cynical satire of rock and roll cli—

ches “Who Loves the Sun” with its
title as u sneering refrain and the
melodious line ”Since you broke my
heart," Just drips or sarcasm, the
repetition of “not at all" in‘ ock
n' Roll” is about as sarcastic as
even Lou Reed can get

Every group at one time or another
is required to sing the praises or
rock and roll music and it typis
ties this album that Lou Reed puts
his tribute in the lorm of a song
about a plastic hippy chickwho likes
rock, but misses the whole point of
rock and roll. Certainly the grow-
ling repetition ol ”And it was all
right" at the end of “Rock n' Roll"
puts it all into focus. The whole
album is high camp, full or lyri-
cal putdowns Listen toLouReed’s
vocal in “I Found a Reason", When
he sings “and the reason, dear, is
you” and breaks into a spokenverse
a la Dion and the Belmonts. The
cliches are so obvious, and the sare
casm in his voice so blatant, that
the satirical cynicism becomes
readily apparent, Lou Reed's spas
ken comments belore instrumental
breaks only heighteli the effect.

PROBLEMS «mm W1)

Another student mentioned recent
problems in Black—White relations
as a major factor in his departure
He complained that “as a full luie
tion payer, 1 could hardly acceptthe
demands ol the Grinnell Blacks;
the college can't afford such unrea-
sonable demands.” The same stus
dent also blasted the quality of the
Scarlet and Black, the lack ofem—
phasis given to the Communications
Department, and the increasing use
ofhard drugs on the campus.

Lou Reed always was agreatsong-
Writer and “Sweet.iztne”stands out
as a masterpiece. That song says so
much that no matter how I listen
to it. i know l havenjt gotten it all.
“Sweet Jane” is at least as means
ingful as Dylan’s “Mr. Jones.” It
isn’t a song- YS Ii Wholelife View
Reed’s sensitivity, crystalized in
the third album, becomes :1 vehicle
of artistic statement in Loaded
Structurally, most or the songs are
in two parts, the lirst part pree
senting a person in a life situation,
and the second (or, instead, just a
different and distinctive verse or
retrain) explains a reaction to it
Listen to “Who Loves the Sun "
“Sweet Jane,” “Rock n’Roll,”
“New Age,” “I Found a Reason”
0r “Lonesome Cow90y Bill,” for
example, demonstrate what 1 mean.
It is interesting to note, too, that
the titles of songs on this album are
absolutely insignificant, almost to

the point of being a camp satire at
rock titles,

But more than an artistic state
ment, Loaded is very good rock
music. People can dan‘ceto it, groove
to it, listen to it, or even feel it.
it’s good listening when you’re strai-
ght, or when you're loaded, 1t also
was commerically ,successful»~
something new and unusual tor a Vel-
vet Underground album. It’s really
unlortunate that the band broke up
alter the album’s release.

He also cautioned againstattuching

results. ”We can learn quite a bit
from those who withdrew, but we
should not base our programs tor
change on just these responses”
in an interview with the son, he
added that the views of those still
at Grinnell, and especially Seniors
about to graduate, should provide
a more valid overall picture of the
views of students who are attending
and will be coming to Grlhnell.
