Indecision

You know the usual llight-befol-e-eonvention editorial
as well as we do. it comments one the week’s campaigning,
urges everyone to 'get out and vote for whoever they think
would be the best president, or bemoans the prevailing
status of student government.

This year the 38:3 editorial board, five members strong,
is split five ways on the question of What the night-before
convention editorial ought to be.

One member is supporting Roger and the all-college
council. Another thinks Tom and proposed change in the
out rule is the best idea, and a third has tossed his hat in
for Ed and the strike-vote. The fourth member of the board
thinks the Student Council itself should be abolished, While
the fifth is El member of the election board and remaining
neutral on the whole question.

We can’t agree on anything, but at least we all llavel
ideas. Maybe that‘s a good sign.

is Tom Railsback thei
candidate for Student
Council President? Because he-
not only has 2 fine and useful
platform, but also possesses the
necessary personal qualities to;
do a top notch job.
Tom has earned much due re-
spect and cooperation from all
those who know him and have;
worked with him. His willingrl
ness to accept responsibility andl
see the job done Well to the end
is of utmost importance. ‘i
Tom is also open-minded to
any suggestion that might an-
able the Student Council to
function more efficiently. For
these reasons we the under-
signed are behind TOM RAILS-
BACK all the way for Student
Council President.

Why

To the editor:

AS far back as I can remem-
ber, the most prevelent crit-
icism of our Student Council is
that it does not represent the
opinions of the students in sug-

ning new policy. It’s not that
the student Council hasn't done
a good job in surveying student
opinion, but fundamentallyl
they have no actual power
which would put them on a

ministration. As it now stands,’
we can only suggest, and the
administration can either accept
or flatly reject our views, as
they so desire.

Consider the platform of Ed
Weitz. The only possible way
to enter into a fair bargaining
situation is for us to have some
element to fall back upon in
the event the administration
will not give us a hearing. And
this would be the strike plat-
form.~lt's not that Ed advo-
cates a strike a month, but that
to have an opportunity to lhear
the straight voice of the admin~
istralion we must have the
power eminaling from the
strike vote. .

Ed Weitz’s platform is a
challenge to the individual
student. If you are concerned
with the present dilemma of the
Student Council and want it to
successfully meet the adminis-
tration in carrying out student
objectives, then you will not
pass up the opportunity offered
by Ed. 1 sincerely hope you will
accept not only the best plat-
form I have ever seen but also
the candidate who could carry
it out and strengthen student
government.

To the editor:

i guess this is sort of an age-
old plea, but rd like to voice
it again since all of a sudden
it's beginning to
thing to me. Tomorrow we’re
going to‘ have a big nominating
convention and by Monday we'll
have a new Student Council
president.

mean some

That's all very fine. but his-
tory can and will repeat itself
again, and Student Council will
continue to be what somel
Conservative factions call a
farce, unless and until the stuv
dent body sees fit to maintain
its enthusiasm past the duration
to campaign week.

be-
all

We're all getting tired of
mg labeled apathetic, We

know we’re apathetic, and we
don’t much care until we get
all fired up about some specific
incident that happens to pene-
trate that shell of individuall
sclf»concern and peace of mind
and we decide lo do something:
For a while we carry on a vig-
orous campaign of righteous in-
dignation and administration,
bucking and what have you, un~
til suddenly we realize that it’s
hard work and no fun to rep
bound feet first from a stone
wall.

so we give up and settle back
again into the “normal" college
life of an occasional non-direct-
cd gripe and a somewhat bitter
resignation to our zpzthetic fate.
The sad part of it all is that
t doesn’ “have to be in that way.

The administration wasn’t
kidding when it suggested that
the students could have more
responsibility if they’d just
take it. But more than fifteen
or twenty or thirty such stu-
dents will havc to take it7or
it_ won't work and the respon-
slbllity will be rightfully taken
away. 1, among others on this
campus, have learned that little
lesson7but. perhaps, about four
years too late. ‘

No matter what sure-fire plat
form a candidate has to offer,
no matter how strong the can.
didate is7he can’t and won't do
a thing unless he has a lot of
intelligent, thinking, determined
people to back him up—ztnd that

goes for any office. Think it
over.

Sincerely,

Each year since I‘ve been here
the stereotyped version of the
“Grinnell success story" has
had a harder time getting elect-
ed student council president.
Last year it won 398 to 373, a
measly margin of twenty—five
votes. Maybe this year the
Grinnell student body will ren-
ovate its stereotype and bring
it up to date, complete with a
platform.

by Bruce Cole

Can it he that the dynasty
of basketball players and sing-
ing waiters has burned itself
out. It is hard to‘ picture any-
thing so lifeless dying such a
lusty death.

However this election turns
out i feel that l owe all (well,
most) of my fellow students a
deep apology. When i first
heard of Ed Wcitz's proposed
platform and campaign i ad~
vised 'Ed and his disciples not
to waste their time and effort.
1 just didn’t think that this
campus remembered how to
laugh at anything but itself.

1 particularly want to apolo-
gise to the ladies on the other
side of the tracks. i heretofore
thought of them as little girls
who ought still to be playing
with dolls and organising fan
clubs, By their independence
of mind they've shown me that
l was wrong. 1 wish especially
to congratulate the freshmen
women for the way‘ they’ve
thumhed their‘ noses at pre-
Cedent,

I think that Ed‘s going to
win this election because I
think that the campus is finally
ready to take someone like him‘i
seriously. if he doesn't it'll be
because he’s running against
two Very nice guys who have
and deserve a lot of friends.

That used to be enough.
