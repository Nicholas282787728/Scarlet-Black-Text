Soldier Bonus Stud-
ents Growingﬁewer

About 1,000 state soldier bonus stu—
dents have enrolled in the University
of Wisconsin this semester, under the
Wisconsin soidiers'eduoational bonus
act. and about do per cent of them are
new students Quite a tow ot the
new students are not freshmen. but
have entered the University of Wiscon~
sin trom other schools. especially from
the Milwaukee branch ot the Univer—
sity at Wisconsin where they took
the two-year engineering course.

Two years ago this time 1.400 soldier
bonus students were enrolled in the
university and last year there were
1.200. Thisdeereass may be due to
the tact that the number of men qual-
itying under the.bonus act who wish
to enter the university naturally grows
less each year. The bonus act which
was passed by the state legislature two
years ago, expires at the end ot ﬁve
years, aiter having tarnished each bc-
nus student with a maximum or $1,080.
or $30 per month tor tour school years
of nine months each.

In memorial presented to Harding.
advisory council or tedersl reserve
system protests against legislation
making mandatory appointment or
“dirt" tanner as board member.

For New World Good

(Continued Iron: Page one)
aide the future policy of their nation.
They are made of the right stuff, and
their spirit is out not for war but
{or peace, nut for destruction. but

construction. and they have, it I aml

any judge oi character, ﬁne and no-
ble qualities which will help the
world icrward out oi its present ruin.
I would like to se this
linked up with other associations oi
journalists and literary men in Calla»
do and Great Britain—perhaps in oth—
er cuuntries That would make tor
a power or international good will
which would be oi more importance
than a league or nations.

In continuation oi his observations
on the people here. ”Those business
men oi the lliddle West are pi'ofounde
ly conscious or the fact that the pres-
ent depression or trade is due to the
downfall of ioreign markets; they are
prepared to back a policy which will
make {or international peace and lead
to the rapid recovery or ioreign mark-
ets I ﬁnd many times that they are
impatient with the policy or the Sen-
ate and the political leaders and that'
they have an idealism beyond my ex—
pectations. On all sides I hear the
wish that the United states deal bold-
ly with the question or demobiliza-
tion or armies. the possibility of credit
to Russia. and the readjustment or
German reparations \ .

"Occasionally I have doubts thrust
upon me as when a certain general
who spoke recently in Minneapolis
advocated a United states army or
iliteen million men in a slate ct pre~
parednsss tor wart I am told that

fraternity l

 

in many colleges and high schools and
that many boys too young tor the
last war telt that they missed some-
thing grsat and good and long tor the
next war. If that is so there is pro»
cious little hope for white civilization
but I cannot believe that.

“I may he supcrdcial in my observa.
tion. or over-optimistic, but‘I do ieel
Very strongly from my studies of the
people I met in the United tSates that
militarism has no place in public opin-
ion here, and that in Spite 01 certain
prorcssionai and political iireeaters
who would like to see the United states
"Whip the world" and adopt the Prus-
sian Code of ethics, the spirit of the
people as a whole tired to the ideals
of peaceful progress towards a higher
phase or civilization."
