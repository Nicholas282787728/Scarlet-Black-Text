Sam grapples question "What is a Classic”

by Sam Perlman

As 1 sat listening to the Beatles
“Sgt. Pepper's" album. i began to
think about what makes this
album, or any piece oi music. a
classic. Rolling Stone magazine
rated that album the best oi the
last 20 years. But there are a lot oi
people who think that “Sgt Pep-
per‘s" is not the Beatles‘ best
album at all. There are even some
people who iind that album totally
worthless.

l remembered a conversation i
once had with a drummer iriend oi
mine who is a iew years older than
i am. He iound it iunny that the
“classic rock" oi the late 70s was
nothing but the Top-id ol the mid-
dle and late 605, This set me to
thinking about the iuture oi
“classic rock."

Right now. the trend in “classic
rock” is the music 0| the late oils
and early 605. That's the childhood

music oi those that are in the
money now- the Yuppies. what
happens when we. the post-
Yuppies, come to rule lhealrwaves
with our iinancial powch

Just think» 12 years irom now.
we'll be within a iew months oi the
turn oi the century, the year zooo.
To the childrcn oi that generation,
the novelty hit oi the year will be a
1982 song by some old man named
Prince titled ”1959." Our kids will
think it's a novelty. but some oi us
may have some iond memories oi
High School Junior Prom that go
along with that song To those at us
with those memories. that song
will be a classic

Dream ior a moment about the
Parents' Weekend sock hops
within the next two decades. In
stead oi playing "Wild Thing" by
the Troggs. they‘ll be playing
“West End Girls" by an obscure

onehit band named the Pet Shop
Boys. KGGO's noon-hour classic-
rock show will begin with Bryan
Adams, move into John Cougar
luellcncamp. Huey Lers and the
News. and then into a slow song by
Madonna Wait until the Muzak
version oi a Duran Duran song
plays over the oliice sound system.
taking you back to less. and what
was her name again?

l guess the only thing that can
separate the classics irom the
iorgotten is time. The next 10 years
will be a lot diiierent irom the past
in Perhaps it's up to us to carry
the music we cherish into the
tuture and leave the rest oi the
junk behind Remember that on
Monday morning when “Mallet
and Morgan in the Morning" yolts
you out oi bed with Mellencamp's
"Paper in Fire."

doesn't always work. Also. I think

the songs don't mesh as well as on

By the time Ruth turns 13, the
