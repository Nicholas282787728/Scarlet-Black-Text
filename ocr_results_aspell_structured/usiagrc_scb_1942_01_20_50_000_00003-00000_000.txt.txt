Dollar Assessmeni
Fades inio Background

Senior class members may now
breathe easily, enjoying unper-
turbed slumber.

The proposed plan calling for a
tweedollar assessment per mem-
ber of the senior class for settle-
ment of the 1941 Cyclone debt,
which last week loomed promi—
nently in the horizon, has faded

The obligation of the senior
class to the Stewart-Simmons
Engraving co, of Waterloo, was
settled last niday during a meet—
ing between cunt Taylor, senior
class president, and a represen-
tative of the company.

a new contract was drawn up,
calling for an immediate payment
of $500 and a second payment
of $175 by the first of the week.
This is a reduction of about $100

Enrollmen'l' Drop

Although enrollment figures for
second semester can be only ten
tative at this date, Miss Bethana
MCCandleSS, registrar, said that
there won‘t be too much of a. de-
cline in the number of students.

She bases her belief on the
fact that most students will want
to finish their college year. Ex~
cept for those men who are draft-
ed, Miss Mccandless said that
very few will be leaving col~
lege.

Miss McCandless does predict a
decline in enrollment for next
year, however,
