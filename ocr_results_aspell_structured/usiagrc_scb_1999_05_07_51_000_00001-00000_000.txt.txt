help with
Arbor Lake
cleanup

Organizers were thrilled that more
than 130people showed up to take part in
the Commuruty Day clean-up Saturday
May 1 at Arbor Lake.

KC. and Karla Cornish, who spear»
headed the citizens‘ initiative, said the
main objective of the cleaneup was to
clear the sight lines toward the water to
enhance the lake‘s role as the focal point
ofthe park, and also to clear a view of
Hazelwood Cemetery from Arbor Lake
Park, and visa versa.

In addition to all the volunteer labor,
the city‘s public works department was
there in force, headed by Glenn Baker.
Hundreds of hands working together
cleared wide tracts ofunderbrush on the
lake‘s east side before the corps stopped
e exhausted but smiling A to celebrate
their accomplishments by sharing a pic-
nic lunch provided by the Comishes and
Hy-Vee, and serenaded by the Dixieland
Band.

“There's at least as much work to be
done on the west side: at least another
day‘swork,”saidK. .Comish,who also
serves as chair ofth city's park board.
”We‘re going to havethe next parkboard
meeting here so we can see what’s been
done and discuss how to proceed.”

Discussions continue both on how to
build on Saturday’s accomplishments at
Arbor Lake, and whether the Commu-
nity Day should become an annual event.

Lawmakers hope for Vilsack
veto of anti-trial amendment

By JOHN BREEMER

News/opinion etirioi

Both state lawmakers who represent
PowcshickandJaspcrcountiesbclleve
Gov. Tom Vilsack should exercise his
linceitcm veto power to delete. lan
guage from an appropriations bill that
potentially could derail plans for de
velopmentoflheGrinnellArea Recre-
ation Trail (GART),

State Sen. Dennis Black, D-Grin-
nail, and Rep. Danny Carroll, R»Grin»
ncll, said in separate interviews that a
late-session amendment to the Infra-
structure Appropriations Bill deserves
to be scuttled by the govemor, because
it adds language specifying that no
money contained in the measure can
be used for trails on land that is ac
quired through condemnation.

The condemnation issue involved a
patiencertrying debate in both houses
of the lowa Legislature. A separate
bill, HP. 476, makes it ilnpossible for
local governmental agencies to cone
demn agncultural land for trail devel-
opment. Tlle governor already has ex-
pressed reservations about that mear
sure and has hinted that he may veto
the legislation in its entirety.
Lineiteiii authority

Because the condemnation measure
is legislation that appropriates no
money and simply involves a change

inthelowaCode,Vilsackcaii'tuscthc
ilneriiem veto, which is reserved for
appropriations bills, But he can use it
to delete language contained in the
infrastructure bill, wllich pl’OVldCS
$270.1 million over the next two ﬁscal
years tltrough the Rebuild lowa Infrae
stnrcture Fund (RllF).

Black said he met Tuesday with an
aidetothegovemorandurgedthelinc-
itcmveto,sayingthcamendment‘slan-
guage represents a threat not only to
trails but to other projects involving
condemned land Black called the
amendment “nonsense."

The Vllsack aide, Black said, told
him that “the governor is looking
closelyatremovingthatsegment"from
the bill.

Carroll said he thinks the governor
will deletethe language ——”and, in my
mind, should."

Voice vote

in theHouse, Carroll said, the amend-
ment, offered by Reps. Bill Dix, R-
Shell Rock, andGet-i Huscr, D-Altoona,
passed on a voice vote,

“My guess is that it was an amend-
ment late in the process that probably
didn't gain much attention because it
was sponsored by a Republican and a
Democrat, giving the impression that
it was non-controversial when, in fact,
it could create a lot of problems,"

Carroll said.

Cat-roll added that he doesn’t even
recall voting on the amendment and
suggested that he might have been
away from the House chamber when
the voice vote occurred.

GART is a project that has drawn
considerable local support. Spearr
headed by Grinnell 2000 and the Grinr
nell Bike Club, it has won backing
from the Poweshiek and Jasper county
boards of supervisors. And the Grin-
nellCityCouncilhasagreedtosuppon
a plan to constnict a trailhead facility
ihat would provide parking and other
amenities to bicyclists using the trail,
which would link Grinnell with Rock
Creek State Park in Jasper County.

Major contributions toward GART
have come from such entities as the
leldeWen Foundation and Grinnell
State Bank.

City calls agencies, institutions to meeting
to discuss cooperating Y2K contingency plan

lfthe much—hyped Year2000 prob
lem were to strike in Grinnell, would
you know what to do about things you
needed to survive? If the power grid
failed on the transition from 1999 to
2000, where would you scndyourchil-
drcn, or your grandmother?

Some answers toquestions like those
could come from a meeting called for
May 12 by Jan Anderson, water and
wastewatersuperintendcnt forthe city,
on behalf ofthe city of Grinnell,

Anderson hopes that the ﬁrst meet-
ing will be the ﬁrst ofa series in which

the City and some of its institutions set
up contingency plans,to beused in the
event ofthe types of disasters people
envision could come as a result ofso-
called Y2K bug,

“The city‘s been working on the
Y2K problem and contingency plan
for the past two years," said Anderson,
“and I’ve spoken with people from the
hospital, and the college and others,
and there seems to be a little bit of
interest in trying to put something to
gether on a local level.

“We discussed it internally at the

city office,” he said, “and we decided
we would host a meeting."

The idea: to poll institutions in the
city and ﬁgure out what preparations
they may have already made for any
problems that might arise as a result of
the millennium bug,

Due largely to the scarcity of memory
in early computers, programmers of-
ten clided the ﬁrst two digits when
referring to the year in their computer

Y2K PLAN-
conririiled on back page

 

Talking about preparations
for Y2K should give us a plan

Jan Anderson wants to make a plan, and we're going to try and help him,
We hope everyone else he asked wnl help, too.

Anderson, the city's water superintendent, having completed the city’s
Year 2000 readiness plan, wants to bring local institutions like the college,
the hospital, the city, the county, the school district, the local Red Cross and
the media together to make a city-wrde contingency plan against the eventu-
alities that might occur as the century turns. (See story, page 1.)

No one knows what will happen at the stroke ofmidnight Dec. 3i ofthis
year. Conjecture, we know, ranges from an uneventful, if exhuberant, New
Years celebration to a disaster the scope ofwhich is only imaginable in the
darkest of minds. Some say financial systems could collapse worldwide, to
say nothing ofsccnanos in which widespread power failures trigger collapses
in heating and environmental systems and food shortages. To be honest,
some of the conjecture makes the emerging literary genre of “survivalist
melodrama" look like a walk in the proverbial park.

An informal survey of business and institutional sites indicates the truth
will probably fall closer to the “uneventful, ifcxhubcrant" end ofthe

spectrum, but no one seems to be
able to say for Sure.

Why? The answer lies Somewhere
between interdependence and
independence. The way the world
works now, wrth myriad computer
systems handling day-to-day tasks
wc scarcely ihink of while relying
on, information travels almost

iransparciitly between requester and proVider. The network across which we
receive our power automatically balances loads in the event of greater or
lesser damands in given areas. One business’s machines can request informa-
tion, or even hard goods, to be moved from city to city, or country to country.
Long-distance telephone service, only a few ofdccadcs .igo such an intricate
procedure it couldn‘t be completed Without the help of an cxpcn technician,
has become so much ol'a convenience that it‘s really a necessity. We
scarcely think anything of calling ilic coast, or even another continent, and
oﬁen while driving at 70-plus miles an hour down the interstate.

This inrcrdcpcndencc has given all orus an independence ofwhich our
ancestors could never have dreamed But, like everything, it comes at a cost

Altd the bill. as they 51y, is coming due this year

in the business world, this interdependence is where most ofthe Y2K
preparation has come Anyone in a managerial capacity has had a raﬁ of
“Y2K Complaincc Certificates" from customers and vendors cross his or her
desk. And, in fact, that's one way ofhandiing the problcm on a small scale:
ensuring that those with whom you enjoy this interdependence are taking
steps to make sure their firms are safe from the bug.

(For our part, siiicc 90-plus perccnt ofour business is done on Apple
Macintoslics — and we‘re inihc process of migrating the rest to Mac 7 we‘rc
lifting .1 line author Douglas Adams offered Apple for an advertising slogan:
“We may not have gotten everything right, but at least we knew the century

was going to change")

But the answer is not in ﬁnger -poiniing or assessing responsibility, but
rather in calling this intcrdepencdence into reality. When one business hears
from another, “We value our customer or supplier relationship and want to
keep it going," it’s pretty hard Mai to take steps to keep the relationship.

And, in a way, that's what Anderson’s plan is about. If, on the micro scale,
local institutions and businesses have plans for the turn ofthe millennium,
then why not share those plans and make sure there isn't ovcnnuch duplica-

tion.

Why not, like the community we are, depend on one another in the event

ofa disaster?

GART proiect
is a casualty

To the editor:

Sunday’s Des Moines Register edito-
rial page identiﬁed the Grinnell Area
Recreation Trail (GART), to be buili
between Grinnell and Rock Creek Lake,
as being the victim oflegislation passed
by the recently completed session of the
General Assembly. Thisaction wascom—
prised of a paragraph inserted in the
Infrastructure Appropriations Bill by the
Iowa House of Representatives, largely
on a partisan vote. Their action was
ratified by Senate Republicans (excep-
tion of Senators Maddox and Lamberti)
in the closing hours of the session.

Although sub; ect to interpretation, the
inserted paragraph would appear to pro-
hibitthe constructionof a recreationtrail
on any land previously acquired by
condemnation.lnviewoftheprobablllty
that segments of the highway right—of—
way between Grinnell and Rock Creek
were condemned, the planned “back
slope" tmil construction could be ac-
compiishedwithpnvatehindsonly,since
state trail grant funding could not be
used. As The Register reported, this
wouldhkclyscuttle the project, for With
out question, state trail grant funding is
essential to match tlte local ﬁnancial
participation. Grant monies are dcnvcd
from state gambling tax revenues.

l have spoken with the governor's
staff, and they understand the need for
the veto Such public policy is not in the

best interest of our citizens. At the
govemor‘srequest, 1 am formulating the
written argument for his consideration.

This Legislature was very anti-trails.
And the legislation was predominantly
partisan, with Republicans supporting
the myriad of roadblocks ton-ail acquisi-
tion and construction, and Democrats
opposing the measures. Bizarre, to say
the least. And very short-sighted, for
fan-lilyeoriented outdoor recreation has
steadily grown. with the National Dis-
covery Tmil (coast to coast across the
U.S.)plannedforlocationthroughlowa,
Iwouldn‘tbe surprisedto seetheproject
scrapped and moved south to Kansas,
where it was originally to be located,
This would represent a great loss to Iowa
tourism.

ForGART to become reality, the gov-
emor must act by using his veto pen. I am
conﬁdent he will! 7 State Sen. Dennis
Black, Grinnell

Baker thanks

To the editor:

Overihe past few years there has been
so much happening in this great continu-
nityorours, and muchofir could not have
been done without the help of many,
many volunteers.

On Saturday, May 1, Iwas involved in
a clean-up preject at Arbor Lake, and 1
am told that there \vasatotal of about 105
people who signed in that day as volun-
tears. I have to say that l was very ini-
presscd with the tuniout and even more
impressed with the amount of debris that
was cleaned up around the lake.

We have a new wooden bridge built
