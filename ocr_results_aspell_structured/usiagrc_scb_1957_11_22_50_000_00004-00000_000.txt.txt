. The only valuable ideas to come out of tlle National
Student Association's Iona-Nebraska regional meeting here
last Saturday were contained in President Bowen’s address
to the conference. Grinnell has reason to be grateful for
the occasion which gave us a chance to hear his thought-
provoking ideas on student government. But after all, we
have President Bowen, so why bother to keep NBA?

The regional meeting brought into clear focus the
“nothingness” which the National Student Association offers
us. Accordingly, Student Council made a strong move for
organization where it counts — in the Midwest conference,
whole the schools are our size and have our interests and
problems ~ by dropping membership ill NSA.

If it is good to pat oneself on the back, then the con-
ference had some good results. It is gratifying to realize
that Grinnell does not have the faculty and administration
censorship of student activities and publications which ham-
per smaller schools because of their size, and larger schools
because of state support, Certainly it is refreshing to turn
back from the complete preoccupation by other schools witll
“Greek" power and student alliances to our own interest in
the runnings of the campus. (Perhaps our preoccupation is
with )trifles - at least they are in the proper area of con-
cern.

Patting ourselves oil the back is pleasant, b t it doesn't _

prove a thing. The only way 'we can really ju ge Grinnell
is on the basis of sim‘lar schools. During the regional meet-
ing it got a little tiring,r to hear about ’the problems and
achievements of university campuses and their daily papers.
In the NSA literature it‘is a waste of time to read about the
problems and implications of “Greeks," student alliances,
and leadership training.

So, we are going to use our $45 a year fees to better
advantage, and at the same time concentrate on the Mid-
west conference organization, in which we can find value
and be of value. We have dropped out of the NSA before.
Let us hope that this time we stay ollt of it until it be
comes worthwhile for use. ' '

It is only the women who can get rid of the Women’s
Social Budget committee and find a better system by using,
in part, men’s suggestions. If you want change, work for

i . it. If you’le too lazy, live with it and don't complain. (Since

mass meeting have some possible worth and the budget
committee has no possible worth, let lls get rid of the
latter before we consider the former.)
., The women need a constitutional ammendment which
will accomplish the following things:

1. Abolish the_Social Budget committee as such.

2. Place the Quadrangle Social cl irman in charge of
coordinating all women‘s social activities as regulated by
the Social Coordinating committee. (She should be in charge, '
but, according to the constitution, the committee is.)

3. Abolish the position of Quadrangle treasurer.
(Salary: $50 a year; Duties: administer the washing ma-
chine and hail funds, and pass out vouchers to the other
members of the committee.)

4. Place the League Board treasurer in charge of the
washing machine and hall funds, in addition to the League
Board fund. (The Cof'HP does it—it works! If the League
Board could use some of the monev in the, washing machine
fund for general expenses, the halls could have more money
for separate use.)

5. Give the Quad social chairman, washing machines and
sewing machines chairmen. and any other League Board
appointees who need them, funds of their own. complete
with vouchers. (It would save tllcir time and make the job
of the League Board treasurer reasonable. If the appointees
aren’t trustworthy, they shouldn’t be appointed.)

Change in this area must he done by a constitutional:
amendment Bel'ore such all amendment can he passed, itl
must be read at a mass mectin The vote must come at a‘l
second mass meeting which two- iirds of the womcn attend.‘
For the proposal to pass it must have the approval of twov
thirds of the women present. Of course, before the First
mass meeting the proposed amendment must be worked-
out in detail if‘it is to succeed.

Well. this is one way of doing it. There are others, But
if anything is to be done, it is up to you,

"THE DIRTY LITTLE SECRET"

The Swedish motion picture
“One Summer of Happiness”
which played at a downtown
theatre this , .
\veck drew a
good v sized
crowd, most of
which came with
the hope 01
viewing some
bare skin. Most
of these people
went home with'
the hope SatlSr
ﬁed (unless they
happened to blink once or
twice). '

Some of our sewer-minded
sophomores, their m as occu-
pied with what D. H. Law-
rence calls “the dll‘ty little
secret," ridiculed the same
“bare skin" scenes. With
mouths wide open, and com-
pletely unconscious of the dil-
ﬁculties of translation, these
same collegialls ridiculed the
subtitles. Small wonder, isn’t'
it, that most seniors are glad
they’re leaving in June?

Strange as it may seem to
those aliecied by the accelerated
adolescence of Hell Week, the
Swedes, when making a motion
picture like “One Summer of
Happiness," do not set out to
tell a dirty story (even though
American promotion of the ﬁlm
leads you to believe you are
going to a burlesque show).

The ﬁlm was obviously lllrantl
as a reinforcement of the Swed-
ish social philosophy that grants
sexual freedom to its young
people. Believing, as D. H. Law
lence and many others do, that

rm of the barrier to un-
