Former student returns to Grinnell as professor

by Meridith Levy

Docs Grinnell College attract
its students to return to the
comfortable Iowa setting to teach
future Grinnell generations?
How does the perspective of
Grinnell College change through
the eyes of a professor? This
year, Colin Sacks overcame the
studentjtcachcr barrier to join the
1988 Grinnell College staff. A
1979 Grinnell College graduate.
Sacks now stands ready to share
his knowledge and enthusiasm as
a professor of Psychology at
Grinnell College.

Colin Sacks graduated from
Grinnell with a major in
Psychology. Before jumping
into graduate school, he spent
time as a wrangler, taught at a
preschool. and worked at The
Santa Barbara Therapeutic Horse
Back Riding Academy in its
fundamental stages. Sacks
continued formal study of
Psychology at University of
California at Santa Barbara where
he received his masters in
Cognitive Development and later

his PhD. He returned to the
Midwest for his postdoctorate
research on Self Disclosure at
Indiana University. He arrives at
Grinnell this fall after spending a
long summer as "an avid city
league softball player." His return
to Grinnell may be marked by his
entirely different position, but his
seventies’ .evi's continue to suit
him well in 1988 at Grinnell
College.

What does Grinnell College
look like through the new layers
of degrees and faculty status?
Professor Sacks stresses his
comfort with the students of
Grinnell. While he admits that it
is too early to judge, Sacks has
the impression that the student
population is not substantially
different from that of his
generation. He feels that
Grinnell reached its peak in
radical change between 1968 and
1978; the difference between
1978 and 1988 seems marginal in
comparison. After spending time
at the University of California at

Banana, kumquat, and
avocado with whip cream may
sound like some dessert
concoction. but KDIC's "Mating
Game" has enough to whet
almost anyone's appetite,
considering the "open minded"
them it stresses. (If you have
been listening to the shows
Thursday nights, you would
know what that refers to!) Jodi
Hester and Chris Martin, the
"Cruise Directors”, "navigate" the
game show with bubbling
enthusiasm. Future shows will
appeal to more people, catering
to their varied tastes. The show,
as listeners will have already
realized, considers the gay and
lesbian communtity at Grinnell
College. It will also leave the
option open for the guest to pick
form the mystery panel of males
torbc, of either gender.

The halfrhour program
matches one guest with another
(from a panel of 3) through a
question and answer session. The
matched couple receives a date

receive consolation prizes. "No

The program, sponsored by
Tasty Tacos, Grinnell Cinema
Theatre, and Home Ideas, is the
brain child of Kathleen Battles.
"She brought us [cmise directors]
together...l just want to really
express how, no matter how suc-
cessful the show is. we will still
be the same...and if we‘re 'picked
up‘ and syndicated. we'd be big

colors to favorite forms of fore-

students of the large universities,
the Grinnell students of 1988
have a laid back tone similar to
the students of Sacks's
generation. The comfortable
Grinnell which he left in 1979
greets him today. The difference
lies in his new perspective. He
has to adjust to the "total auton-
omy" of the role of professor.
He is learning to find the
distinction between the sense of
authority as a professor and the
relationship to the students as a
peer. As a student at Grinnell.
Sacks always felt comfortable
talking openly with his
professors, yet he still held
reverence for them. Now, he‘s
ﬁnding it interesting to talk to
his former professors as peers.
"it's strange to be on the other
side of the desk."

Sacks currently teaches
Developmental Psychology and
will also teach a section of the
Introduction to Psychology later
this semester. Next Semester
Sacks will teach Abnormal

Psychology in addition to his
sectiort of the introduction to
Psychology course.

Professor Sacks's main focus
in psychology is learned
helplessness and self efficacy in
the classroom. His ultimate
interest and goal in psychology is
"improving the quality of
education for people who think
they can‘t do something that they
really can do." His interest in this
topic sparked at Grinnell while he
tutored students who's lack of
intellectual conﬁdence hindered
their class performance. Sacks
carried his goals of combating
learned helplessness to his
various jobs and studies. After
devoting much of his research to
the field of self efficacy and
learned helplessness, Sacks hopes
to eventually share his knowledge
to students at Grinnell College.
As a professor of Psychology, he
aims to focus on personality and
"introduce Social and Develop—
mental psychology and
research."

The Mating Game, sets sail

However, Lynn, the winner, said
"I don't think I could come up
with those answers if we [Andrew
and Lynn] didn‘t know each other.
He made me more comfortable
when I knew it was him. We
lived together [off campus in
Aqua House] last year." Joanna.
who happens to be Lynn's room-
mate, was initially concerned that
their first roommatc tensions
would result from the show.
Nonetheless, they enjoyed it.
"It's a lot of fun. everybody
should do it." said Joanna,

The guests were asked by the
staff to participate in the game.

The Mating Game.

Andrew suessed that "Jodi wanted
me to do it, and 1 said ‘suref She
said I'd be the ﬁrst contestant and
I said ‘I couldn't be happier about
rt.'"

A random phone call resulted
iii a positive response towards the
show. Melissa Cross, a senior
and Hall Activity Coordinator,
had this to say: "i thought it was
really good. I'd like to do it. I
thought it was really innovative."
Melissa's room eventually got
crowded with people listening to
what she described as an "old
fashioned radio show“ atmo-
sphere. "It was a communal ae-

tivity, and it was totally un-
planned. People would be
talking about the questions and
coming up with their own
answsers."

Conversely, a random visit to
a residence room where
floormates gathered to support
the show resulted in different
responses. Susannah Donahue
said she was embarrassed for the
contestants. Joseph Christopher
felt that it was "too much of a
farce," while Jeremy Wells said
that it had potential. Tom Gregg
said. "'l'hey need to tone down the
questions," to which Joseph
added, "They need to tone down
the hosts." Perhaps Scott
Watanabc sums up their
responses: "They have the basic

Lynn and Andrew will be
back in a few weeks to tell us
