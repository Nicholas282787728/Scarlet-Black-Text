Pioneers Tie Gan To Whirl?

Ending the 1941-42 basket-
ball season in a blaze of
glory, the Pioneer cagel‘s
blasted the Drake basketeel's
from the men's gymnasium for the
lost time with a blistering 45 to
19 defeat. 'It was the biggest Pio-
neer victory Inargtl‘l over Drake
since 1912.

Using an offense in which no
one did much scoring, the Bull-
dogs led only in the early moments
when MeClclland broke the ice
with a field goal.

Four seniors, led by captain Pat
Patterson and including Hugh Mn:
Cortney, Ralph Youngstroln, and
Don Hock, played their final
game for Grinnell.

Grinnell‘s defense was at top
form last night on the home court.
and the Drake quintet had to rely
on shots outside the free throw
line. Consequently, the Blue and
White with no offensive sparlt
scored only eight field goals dur»
ing the entire contest,

At half time the Pioneers led
18 to 10, and early in the second
period their shots hogan to click
consistently. Youngstrom pouring
through three field goals in a row
sparked the offense, and McCart-
ney, Harry Waters, and Patterson
took over when the Burlington
flash left off. i

In the end it was a whimpering
and whining kennel of Bulldogs
that went down under the barrage.
Only Lloyd Milbourn, scoring 10
points, showed as a real threat on
offense and defense.

Patterson took scoring honors
for the evening with 15 points.
McCartney scored nine, and
Youngstrom and waters eight
each.

The battered, scarred, 42 year
old walls of Gl'ilmcll‘s famous
“craclrerbox” gymnasium heard for
the last time Monday night the
frenzied yells of modern Pioneers
as they cheered on a spcctaculnr
varsity hashetball to a Victory of
utter finality over Drake,

The undaunted. worn walls stood
alone after the game, and tile
though they stood proud and
strong hack in 1900 when they first
gained their birthright, they were
willing to relax and step aside for
a new $130,000 successor which
is gradually growing on the south
end of ward field.

The old walls haue seen the
first basketball game at Gi-iniiell,
and have seen the passing parade
of Grinnell athletes down through
the years. As one of the largest
gymnasium: in the nation When
it was built, it draw protests from
early athletes who refused to
play the full length of the bas-
ltetball {1001' because it was too
long. -

Built at a total cost of 318,000,
the corner stone was laid on
June 14, 1899, and on January 13,
