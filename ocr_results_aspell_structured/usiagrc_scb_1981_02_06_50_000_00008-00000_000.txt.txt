An interview With A
Human rights activist

While Andrew Yattng, 58‘ was on campus
his! week the 5&8 asked hurt to sit down
and answer some questinns. We hoped that
we could get hurt to be spew/tr on a /Eu‘
issues that he mlghl not be able to COIN" in
his lectures and somu ulht‘r isms that no
thought pertinent to the campus toninntni
ty.

We talked with Young on Thursday muni-
irig and even though he was fighting o// a
sure throat and running on very lltllt' slush.
he sounded as opttrvixsitc about the [urine as
he was during his tum lettings on the
Rnsen/ield Program

Due to clrt'umslantes buyorld our Lulllral
we were not git/en the exclusive trllurvit'w
that we had hoped for. Nonetheless, our
minnows conference with Young loos» quilu
informative He ions interoleuin for thu
5805 by Anne Rowland, Tam Lenlz and
Richard Lelt‘hinger as well as mpresenmlwv
0/ the Grilliiell lleraldkegislcr. Here is
an Cdlled tmllscllpl of'thui conversation

—Rlchalst:lchirigur

Q: How well has the United hations
iunctioned in the last [our years?

A: i think pretty fair. The iii-st tvio
years or the Carter administration he
had a mandate to be very aggressive in
the United Nations. So we introduced a
resolution on the whole Anglo-
American plan [or an independent Zim-
babwe. We introduced a set or negotia-
tions for the liberation of southwest
Africa. We moved in me Middle East to

put a peacekeeping force in Lebanon -

This was the first U.S. sponsored
resolution that had been passed Since
1951. We did it successfully and
unanimously. I think the Chinese abs»
tained but they alviays abstain.

Then we had the Iran Crisis, it was
the first time m a long lime every nan
tion in the United Nations except Libya
voted to condemn lran — and then they
(Libya) changed, When it came time
tor the invasion by the Soviets 0|
Alghanistan Ambassador Mciienery
was able to get overwhelming support
lrom the international community to
condemn that invasion
Q: What about Kurt Waldlieiiii's trip to
Iran? There has been a debuts- going on
in the press as to whether it did harm or
good to the whole issue.

A: One of the things that you have to
realize about the United Nations is that
you can‘t get to be secretary general
without the U.S support and the Rus-
sian support. The Russians have
always taken a policy that they nani a

nook secretary- general The) ml] or
approye somebody that they think i
can Intimidate. MN 1 oioni suy- ti
was the case \\ith Kurt Waldheim. l
talking about traditionnlly , th'
been the Russmn pattern.

But I think that his visits, while t
uiun’i produce the return oi
hostages, i think you have to see a1
these ellorts as contributing um:
establishing u climate which kept
hostages and the negotiations alive;
ullimzilely resulted in their return.
