TO THE FRESHMEN

Near the beginning of the current semester announce-
ment was made in the news columns and on the editorial
pages of this paper of a $25 prize contest open to you for
the writing of a freshman class song.

To date none of you have submitted all entry.

Why, we do not know. We do know that tllere is on
this campus someone who could win that prize and at the
same time enrich Gl-innell college, his chosen Alma Mater,
..by the addition of a song.

We would hate to 'think that all the freshmen on this
campus are so satisfied with their lot, so blnse, that neither
the idea of performing a very real service for their school,
nor the ring of Shekels will stir them to action.

We were, at the time of Dr. Steiner‘s announcement of
this award, and still are, of the belief that it is a good idea.

Despite the lack of entries so far we still have confl-

dence that someone is going to submit a prize winning entry.

GET THE HABIT -

Tonight our wrestlers make their home debut of the
season when they meet the Cornell college grapplers, one 01
the nation’s strongest teams.

Wrestling is a comparatively new sport here, only two
years old, but under the tutelage of Coach Guy Loollabaugh,

it has become an important one for the Pioneers. As such,

it desewes the support of Grinnell students

Attendance at home football and basketball games has
become habitual with most Glimlell students Tonight is a.
good time to begin forming the habit of attending wrestling

meets.

#Gi
PHILOSOPHY FOR THE AERAGE STUDENT

Reprinted from the Daily Northwestern.

The shortest distance between two points is often a
university course between registration and a grade. This
shortest distance is usually traveled by collecting a certain
assigned pile of data, hitching it together by a technical
jargon and placing it on exhibition at certain definite times,
notably that of final examinations. Occasionally in this
grim struggle certain students appear who actually are
attempting to get an education. One of the manifest differ:
ences between these students and the general run is that the
really successful student has the faculty to abstract, syste-
matize and generalize.

This may be the result of natural interest of the more
gifted student in the courses they are taking which leads
them to think over the subject matter, relate it to general
principles and draw conclusions which henceforth they use
in their own thinking. Perhaps they have stumbled onto
some courses which have been a help to them.

To the average student who is not particularly interested
in attempting abstract thinking for himself we would re—
commend a course or two ill philosophy. The basic assump
tions upon which our thought rests and the logical methods
which must be employed to discover truth, or relative truth,
might be revealed. They would learn to regard material
presented with a skeptical and inquiring eye, and to relate it
to the more fundamental assumptions. The somewhat neg-
lectcd department of philosophy would probably work a re-
volution on undergraduate thinking if it had access to the
minds of large numbers of students and could be systemati-
cally organized to meet problems.

John Spaulding

Washington, always a center of
interest, was particularly in the
limelight this week as the re-
sult of several recent events led,
perhaps, by the resignation of
Supreme court Justice George
Sutherland.

. e a

The resignation of the coil-
servative judge, which takes ef»
fect Tuesday, created a. stir in
official circles as observers
speculated vainly on a possible
successor to the post. The presi-
dent, however, declined to di-
vulge what he was thinking.
though rumor has it that he may
appoint a westerner or a woman
to the position.

e i i

His decision will probably not
be announced for several weeks
though the grave condition of
Justice Cardozo may keep him
from the bench and thus force a
speedy decision on the presi-
dent's part.

.. ,, i

But more important In official
Washington and to the country as
a whole than even the supreme
court are the president’s plans.
Will the administration pursue a
program of “trust busting," or
will rt strive to conciliate big busi-
ness interests?

. 3 c

Those are the questions every-
one is asking. And to date no
one but the president knows the
answers. Even the series of
Jackson Day speeches by ad-
ministration spokesmen were in—
definite as to the real program
to be followed.

All but one stressed concentra-
tion of control in so»called “big

Secretary of Agriculture Henry
A, Wallace said, “the New Deal

managers of capital.”

Then late this week1 foucwing
a conference with industrial lead-
ers, the president issued invitav
tions to 46 business leaders to
meet with him Thursday. Various
observers saw in the move a
plan to revive at least portions
of the NRA or a similar plan.

.l. l s

Alld Friday the president
capped the climax when he an~
nounced in a press conference his
apposition to the holding company
principle. Business leaders hur-
riedly calculated that the elimina-
tion of holding companies would
ruin nearly half of the largest
businesses.
