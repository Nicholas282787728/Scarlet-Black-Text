by Mary Brandt

o “more awareness that women’s
oncerns are special concerns."

Liberation Movement and its
campaign to awaken in the media,
particularly in advertising and
television, a sense of the sexual
identity and dignity of the in
dependent women, the con-

Thursday, a Grinnell graduate,
Muffie Myerson, '57. will bring her
newly completed documentary
film Grey Gardens to the campus.
Exploring the life roles of two
women. Edith Bouvier Beale and
her daughter Edie (cousins of
Jacqueline Bouvier Onassis), Grey
Gardens has been lauded by critic

Judith Crist, among others.

“In Grey Gardens,” says Crist,
“I find two human beings who are
enthralling. i think this is a very
personal film in its effects on us,
and 1 was opened to these women
on any number of levels that I am
still exploring. I've seen Grey
Gardens four times,"

Myerson, a member of the staff
of the Maysles Brothers, in-
dependent filmmakers (Gimme
Shelter; Sale), is one of five
producers of this stunning
psychologicalrsoclological study of
a daughter unable to leave home.

Other perlormances by women
this weekend include a concert
tonight by Grinnell's former artist-
inrresidence, Sedmara (Rutshtein)
Zakarian, in Herrick at o p.m,

this week comment

of women in society

spitefully portraying the sexuality
of its women as infantile and
dependent. Hollywood has long
delighted in exposing the woman
as sexually confused, self-
destructive when it comes to the
possibility of fulfilling her deepest
desires, and masochistically at
home in relationships where she
can preserve ‘control’ by
renouncing feeling." The films for
this weekend were chosen par-
ticularly because they make some
Comment on the role of women in
society, and because they show
how women are portrayed in the

cinema.
. » Nana. Mom and Me and Growing

Up ‘F'en’lale are Contemporary
documentaries by and about
Women, and the films show that at
least in the area of documentary
film ”a sense of the sexual identity
and dignity of the independent
women” is being developed,

The Heiress and Pat and Mike
are examples of the portrayal of
women in the “Hollywood”
cinema. Both films are definitely
atypical in that they portray
women as being both strong and
independent. Both films are also
masterpieces of the film art.

The Heiress, starring Olivia De
Havilland and Montgomery Clift,

 

was the winner of five academy
awards, including one for Best
Actress. An interesting feature of
the film is the manner in which
director William Wyler uses the
constant opening and shutting of
doors as a clever means of
changing the composition of the
scene.

pat and mike, directed by
George Cukor, is a film teaming up
the talents of Katherine Hepburn
and Spencer Tracy. Given its two
stars, it hardly seems necessary tn
say anything else about this film,
but just in case you’re not a film
fan I‘ll tell you that the Hepburnr
Tracy team was probably the most
dynamic in cinema. The story
concerns the promotion of a
dignified college physical
education teacher (Hepburn) by a
rather seedy promoter (Tracy),
Cukor, who also directed Hepburn
and Tracy in Adams Rib, does a
winning job in Fat and Mike. Like
Adam's Ri this film was years
ahead of its time: it is a feminist
commercial film. Despite an ad
vance in technologS’, Hollywood

films never got any mure'a dvanced ‘

than this in their treatment of
women. If anything, they have
gone backwards since Pat and
