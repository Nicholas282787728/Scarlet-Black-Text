Football Rough

in Gay Nineties

Grinnell Beats Iowa in First
Football Game West of
Mississippi.

BY KENNETH CLAYTON.

“Pooley is hit in the face by Pow-
ers. probably accidentally, Blood
ﬂows freely. Miller gets the ball
somehow, kicks too low, and the ball
is knocked into Sampson's face.
Lyon. about to down Sampson, is
knocked down with a blow on the
breast and Sampson With 8. Clear ﬁeld
‘makes a touchdown." So reads an
account of a Grinnell football game
in the gay nineties.

if the laurel wreaths for bi time
football today are reserved for the
big unlversitles,‘ the hot-house ﬂow-
ers for early work in the great game
of the gridiron should go to Grinnell,
express prepaid. Since those days
Grinnell has not developed as many
’powerful teams. However, if one
may quote from the Y Handbook of
18997"There have been many ,vic—
tories, many defeats, many successes.
but never failure."

First Game. in 1889.

It was-in November of 1889 that B.
group of Grinnell students banded:
together and coyly waved a ch'al-l
lenge in front of the irate hopefuls of>
the State University of lowa The
university promptly accepted the in-
vitation to meet in open battle on a
ﬁeld marked off in 10 yard strips,
and the ‘game was brought into the'
public eye Nov,15,1889. The battle'
was fought on the campus, north of‘
Blair hall. about where the flagpole
now stands

Thus was the start of intercollegi-
ate football west of the Mississippi
river. Grinnell won the game, 24 to
0.

There were no eligibility rules inl
1889,11!) coaches. and only a rather'
hazy idea of the contents of a rule
book. Players were acquainted with
'the general idea of the game and,
while penalties were inﬂicted for'
breaking the rules, it was practically
'impossible to break them. Van Gi ‘
son who played halfback for Grin-
‘,nell had a brilliant striped jersey,
and his “serpentine suit and bird like
hops frightened the S. U. I. rush—
line" according to a contemporary
account

Today’s\Game Much Different.

Next Saturday, with a modernized
aerial attack, a Set of plays which
would have astounded the hopefuls
o! 1559,. and a‘ set of coaches and

. trainer's worthy of a highly trained
'hmy regiment, the 1'929 Grinnell
‘Ploneers whl take the ﬁeld against
Washington university before a
homecoming throng of several thou-
sand people. The Saturday game
will‘serve as an observance of the
afortieth anniversary of the ﬁrst grid-v
lron.contest\west of the Mississippi.
A number of the men who took part
in that opening contest are expected
to return for the affair.

The lineup in 1339 was Huntley
and Everest at ends; Pooley and

:Reed at tackles, Savage and Batley
at guards, Allison at center, Lyon at
quarter, Barrette and Van Gieson at
half backs and Miller at fullback.

in 1390 Grinnell challenged Minne-
sota, losing 18 to 14. In 1591 the

ern championship was involved in
this game, so it was ’played later,
Minnesota winning. 22 to 14.

First Coach Comes in 1392.

The ﬁrst coach and athletic dirECr
‘tor came to Griunell in 1892. The
only gymnasium here at that time
was in the basement of the old
chapel. Games were scheduled any-
where that there was promise of a
sufficient gate to pay the railroad
fare and twenty~ﬁve cents apiece for
supper. Often the players had to
buy their own suppers. Highly Orr
ganizcd football on a business basis
under administrative management
was undreamed of.

Grinnell was undefeated on the
home‘ grounds for six years, and then
took a drubbing in 1895 from Donne
college, Crete, Neb., losing 6 to o. In
the same season, however, the Pione-
ers went to Minneapolis to defeat the
university, 6 to 4. Rivalry with
Drake began in 1898 when two garn-
es were played, Grinnell winning the
first, 12 to 10 and Drake the second
on Thanksgiving day, 18 to 16.

In the entire forty years of foot-
ball the Pioneers have played 251
games, winning 130 of these and

 

two teams tied 12 to 12. The West<

losing 109 while twelve have been

Dr. Steiner Talks
to Y. on Happiness

In a talk before the Y. W. c. A.
Thursday, Dr. Edward a. Steiner
commented on happiness. “Rather
than try to hold up the world.” he
said, “We must remember that the
world is here to hold up up."

Inward joyousness, Dr. Steiner be-
lieves, is the supreme phase of hap-
piness. One should acquire a po er
of appreciation for books, comrades,
pictures, a Smileidnything

”The greatest destruction not only
to happiness but to personality it—
self, " Dr. Steiner remarked, “is rest-
lessness, lack of poise and dignity.
Happiness does not come from what
you have but from what you are and
what you are growing into."

“The greatest happiness is to be
found in your most‘ helpful relation—
ship.with‘ the greatest number of
people. Whatever purpose you may
form strive for a kind of personality
which will unconsciously help other
people.”

school homecoming banquet at

l Campus Opinion i

Question: Do you approve the [was
cut system of not having Saturday
classes?

Donald Joncs: For those living
close to Grinnell it is a great idea,
but personally I prefer Saturday
classes to afternoon classes.

Faith Somers: Having no Saturday
classes gives thc students one day a
week that they may call their own.

Sue Kockafellow: 1 don't approve
of it because it crowds into five days
what we should do in six, and causes
too many afternoon classes.

Peg Hansen: 1 like the present
system of no Saturday classes ,be
cause students can go away for the
week—end without cutting classes,
_prof. Ray: I am absolutely oppos-
ed to it. Afternoon classes seriously
interfere with lab and students are
tempted to leave for week-ends, cut-
ting Friday and Saturday labs.

Edward Tyler: 1 strongly approve
it. It loaves Saturday free for out-
side activitrcs or study without int-
erruption as the individual chooses
to use it.

'_ Band of Forty

to Play Music
at Homecoming

Grinncll will be represented by a
largcr band this year than ever be-
fore, according to Prof. J. M. Bridg—
ham, director of the college band.
Forty men and a drum major will
furnish the music at the homecom-
ing game. .

The bass section has been aug-
mented by one additional B ﬂat bass
and an E ﬂat bass, while the clarinet
section has a larger number than it
has ever had before. Professor
Bridgham added that the lack of
trombones and cornets will give the
band a slightly unbalanced effect.

Attendance at rehearsals has been
cut down because of conﬂicts with
laboratories, freshman football prac-
tice and speedball practice._ To off-
set this several evening practices
have been held. Professor Bridgham
feels that while Grinnell will not be
represented‘this fall by the largest
band that the school has ever had,
but that the group probably will 'be
the best,
