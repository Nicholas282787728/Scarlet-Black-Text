HE announcement on an-
other page, that partial
credit in English is to be given
for society work, is the initial imv
pulse which must inevitably lead
on to a ﬁnal and complete re-
cognition. The ﬁrst step iollows
logically and almost irresistibly.
We commend it to your attention
because we believe tlle need is
well nigh imperative. The de
baters who represent the societies
and the college in the inter-col»
legiate debates should receive
college credit for their walk. The
pm consideration is the actual
, amount of work done in prepara—
tion tor the debates. The ques-
tions debated are almost cntirely
either Economic, Political, Socio-
logical or Historical problems;
which always have a more or less
direct bearing upon the class room
worlr in the respective depart»
ments. Our method of giving
each speaker a speech in rebuttal
makes it absolutely necessary
that he should havea thorough
and comprehensive knotvlege or
the whole subject; and this entails
an amount or leading, resealch
work and careiul thought whi'clt
the uninitiated will hardly be able
to imagine, From experience
and observation, we are prepared
to maintain, that the amount of
actually accomplished

preparation for an iiiterrcollegialc

above named departments. Nor

for the ability to have the most
intricate details at lonpue's
end is certainly not inferior to the
ability to pass the most exacting
examination. At present the
treads of these departments are
regularly consulted, but with col»
lege credit a more strict super-
vision could be instituted
beneﬁcial results. In the realm!
place it otten happens that some
of the strongest available men are
hampered by having to carry in
or 17 hours college work iii order
to complete the requirements for
graduation. It credit were given,
these as well as other students
could enter the debates without
so much danger otsligltting the
regular rvorlr. A 1/an reason
has in the material augmentation
of the quality of work which the
increase of time devoted to the
subject and the added stimulus of
a substantial recognition
would undoubtedly secuie. Film!-

of our debates by making them
ot more general interest both
among the faculty and students,
and also by giving them a recog-
nized collegiate standing without
in any way lowering tlle general

AND BLACK leaves the question to
the serious judgment of faculty

reasonable, expedient and just to
