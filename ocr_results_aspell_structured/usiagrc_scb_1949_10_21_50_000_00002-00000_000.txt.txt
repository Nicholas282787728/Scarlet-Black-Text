The Woes ofa Waiter . . .

Have you ever thought of a waitcr’s life? Is your
owning rallying cry “What”? No more potatoes?” Have you
ci,urLeously uttered a waiter your pet snail in hopes of
speeding liing‘s up? We ourselves belonged to this merry
c ew illitil the haunted expressions straining- under those
liiolehills of food entering tlie dining room began to bother
us.

Curious: we sauntered into a dining room the other
evening-“after the mob had left. We began by asking a
i let: “V ly do you serve tables?” He looked at me, tlieli
called over his shoulder, “Hey fellas, commere and look at

‘ns one man they pulled out their pockets, empty save for
a book of travelers’ checks apiece.

We started to leave, but a low muttering stopped ils.
innocently, we asked. “How do you like your wol'l i” That
‘ilrd it. “How about Hu -up Harry, who’s gotta get back
to his bridge same?” “Or Messy Niko, who’d rather cat

V‘I‘HC l'i them, though. Their cleaning bills must be some,

The bombardment continued full scale. We learned
about ”Wantrlllore Willie," nho liov ' finishes his dinner,

the table.

We pried a word in edgewise “We’re flat, too,” pulling
out. our pockets. ”Could We work here?” _

Our first acquaintance looked at us with pityiiig stern-
lit-5S. “Strip,” he ordered. We barely retained,our modesty
in 0111' flashy Celanese shorts. ”Only two arms,” was the
ﬁrst comment. “How could you clear a whole table at once ”.7”

Be-it the fault of tile protracted Indian summer or the
ll'iighty crush of scholarly activities, our heartfelt pleas for
Illiilerial to fill up a regular “letter to the editors” column

e golie unheeded for the most part. We realize, of
mu e. tliat such extra-curricular literary activities are a
considerable strain, and that, in the past, we have only

.i able to off ' ill reward the Vibrant thrill of seeing
.e’s own production in print.

This reward, we also real .e is not one generallyldeeln-
ml adequate for such efforts sure among a sprinkling of
literati who border on severe psycho-neuroses due to a

We are, however, now in a position to offer a more
litibstantial reward to those epistolarians who have been
lit-ng’ing back, reluctant to let the world view the death-
less prose simply because they are too thoroughly schooled
to the theories of modern materalism. .

The Editorial Whee . . .

The other day while applying a compound called “Ease-Ache"

is pretty silly to say that it ‘-

it in with the rest of the morning mall.

But at any rate, there it was
standing Just a little apart from

lthe rest and, by chance, was in

such a position that a bit of sun-
light strayed across its face caus—

it lay, there amongst telephones,
gluc pots, broken shears, and
other trappings of the trade.

lec a pair of startled gup-

mine the sender’s name. We were
rather disappointed to read' The

The address “Fulton Street”
always seems to bring to mind
automatically “fish markets”
fully expecting an advert"

we me open the object of this
idle speculation and read the
following communication: “Dear
Editor: As editor of a college
publication you‘ lizvc achieved
a distinction worthy of recogni-
tion.” We threw out our chest
and ran a comb through our
golden tresscs. “So have the
members of your staff," They
did likelvlse.YoIl will undoubted-

that you were ‘tups‘ in a vital

straightened our tie, threw out
our firm jaw and shouted an or

Strange, we thought; unique,

for a half dozen quick-frozen
swordfish steaks, we read on:

this work?"

Now this, frankly, stopped us
cold like a quiokrfroken mack-

crafty fish manger .be up to?
Perhaps they were building up
