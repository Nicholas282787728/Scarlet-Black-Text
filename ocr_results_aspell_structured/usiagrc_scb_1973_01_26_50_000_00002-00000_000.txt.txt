on a state level.

Nuclear Effects

A group Independent study by iresh-
men John Dougherty and KathyKrzi-

background of nuclear technology,
the features oi nuclear plants onthe
national level and in Iowa, and the
regulations and politics ot the AEC

Council. The state lSPlRG organi-
zation is currently involved in a
hearing regarding the construction
of the Duane Arnold Energy Center

Other projects in the planning stage
are a comparison oi prescription

Last semester, the Grinnell
group undertook an investigation,
in stores in town, of toys banned
by the FDA. The stores were in-
iormed oi the cliending toys and
the study resulted in their removal
irom the shelves. Another study,
carried out by Michele Rothenberg,
was an extensive housing project
which investigated student housing
and landlord problems insuchareas
as sewage, pets, “noisy hours”
and other questionable contradicla-

JB Urges Pub Relocation

by Mike preed

Student Government opened the new semester Wed-
nesday night with consideration of the budget and pas-
sage of a resolution concerning the Pub, The Joint
Boards also took action on a charge in the bylaws
affecting the SGA Treasurer.

The first business item on the agenda drew one of
the larger crowds seen at SGA meetings this year;
nearly half of Main Hall'; residents showed up to
support a resolution concerning the location of the
Pub in the private dining rooms adjacent to Gardner
Lounge. This area is in the basement OiMain and much
concern has been expressed by the residents oi that
hall and neighboring halls about thepossiblity oiexccss-
ive noise and rowdiness.

Al Rosenfield, Main hall president, opened the dis-
cussion by presenting the resolution in the term of
a motion and outlining the arguments against the Gard—
ner location. John Pieiier, one oi the original support.
ers oi the Pub and a key in the organizational eiiort,
voiced his support oi the resolution. The Substantive
part of the resolution tollows

BE lT RESOVED BY THEJOINT BOARDOF THE STUV

DENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION, acting in the
interest at the students oI Grinnell College. Thni the
Joint Board recognizes the interest tor the establisllr
mem of a pub on campus, but urges the Committee
on Student Services and the President at the College
to Iind a diiierent location (or the pub, not near to
a residence hall, or, at the very least, Dosipone the
opening oi the pub at the proposed location until the
next academic year, lo avoid any possiblity oi diSV
turbance to current residents near to ihe proposed
location at the pub during the late spring, which is
usually a very stressful period in the lives of most
Grinuell students

There was some question as to Whether or not pass-
age oi such a resolution by the Joint Boards would kill
the idea of the Pub. Throughout the discussion it was
emphasized that the objection was to the location
and not the concept of the establishment, but the prob-
ability oI iinding oi an alternative location is not high
at this point. SGA Vice-President Pleiier said that he

didn’t really know it the Trustees would carry through
alter receiving such a resolution, but said that he
suspected they would. Mears House President Rod Mc—
Veigh, however, Said that he thought the action would
kill the Pub. Final vote on the resolution was 15 tor,
0 against and 3 abstain.

The budget passed was substantially the same as
the budget [or first semester. Initiative fund was raised
from $1000 to $1500, the Stth experienced a $75 cut,
Kim was cut $200 in their equipment budget, and a
salary for the treasurer was established at $75. This
last item caused some debate, and it was pointed
out that no matter how much work was lnvolvedin
the job there had been Several applicants for the job
who were willing to serve Without remuneration.

Following much the same logic Tom Marcil proposed
a $26 salary for the House Presidents. This motion
failed, with Marciland House PresidentsCullen, BrDoks,
and Turner voting tor the motion and the rest of those
present voting against or abstaining. While the motion
was taken pretty much as a joke, it did point out the
inconsistency oi giving salaries Ior some positions
and not for other without a solid rationale for the dis-
tinctions drawn. This has been a long-standing point
of contention for the Joint Boards

The other main concern was the Major Concerts
budget. Much dissatisfaction was expressed over the
Darby concert last semester, when compared to pre-
vious year's concerts, and there was a strong feeling
that the board should call in Social Coordinator Elliot
Lewis in to explain the deiiciency. l-larry Derderian
moved to raise the allotment for major concerts to
$9,700 from $8,700, saying that the extra money would
give Lewis more flexibility. The motion tailed l-la»z.

An amendment to the by-Iaws was passed donning
the role of the Treasurer in relation to the Auditor--
the Treasurer is to be the policy deciding oiiicer
and the Auditor is to merely carry outhis instructions.
This stems iron. the controversy surrounding these
ofﬁces last semesteri The action must be voted on
again next week in order to become effective.

lower Heat Creates Hassles

by John Wylie

Reduced thermostat settings on
campus have created several unus-
ual problems for both students and
campus organizations.

Physical Plant Director Dale Hawn
notes that the Physical Plant office
has been swamped with complaints
since the beginning of the new year
from students Claiming that their
dorm rooms were either too hot
or too Cold.

“We are very much aware that

year.
KDlC’s production room suffered
considerable damage in a yet unex-
plained freak accident during the var
cation. Water from showers in the
production studio, which is a con-
verted Whirlpool bath room on the
lower level of Darby Gym came on
at some time during the vacation,
soaking several pieces of delicate
electronic equipment.

Station Manager John Seeiey told

the $355 that the most seriously
damaged piece of equipment, a car-
tridge tape recorder used in pre—
paring taped public service an-
nouncemenis and short features for
the station, would requirea complete
overhaul costing “much coin”.

Seeley planned to meet during the
week with college officals to deter
mine where the blame _. and the
cost of repairsﬁshuuid be placed.

temperature control in the dorm-
itory buildings is very poor”, Hawn
told the SJIB. He explained that,
when the older buildings were con-
structed, coal was the primary
fuel and it was cheaper to skimp
on insulation and simply regulate
temperatures by opening windows
and doors.

Thermostats have been installed in
all the dormitories, but all these
actually do is Control one steam val-
ve [or each building. Thus, a build-
ing with a comfortable second ﬂoor

may be too hot on the top level
and {rigid in the basement.

College administrators and meme
bers of the Board oi Trustees are
studying the problem, and hope to
have long range plans for substan»
