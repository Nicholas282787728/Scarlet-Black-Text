Dining Services promote locally grown alternatives

After years of efforts by students to increase the amount of local foods in the dining hall, Dining Services is responding

After a decade long student led struggle
to bring locally grown food to the dining hall
Dining Services is now proudly touting a sig
niﬁcant increase in the amount oflocal foods
used in Grinncll's kitchens, .1 rcvcrsal ofprevi-
ous claims that the cosr of going local would
be too high.

in 1999 rwo students approached Jon Ans
dclson ’70, Anrhropology, about increasing the
awareness and presence

with local growers who could provide reliabil-
ity, Chef ScottTurlcy said that using more 10»
cal foods has meant "breaking out of that mold
of four or five producers and getting into rhe

network.”
in addition, transportation and invenr
tory maintenance proved to be challenging.

Waltersdorf, the chief buyer for the depart-
ment, spoke to the difﬁculty of transporting

because ofscvcral obstacles, challenge -
including the difficulrly of
transportation on campus,
the inability to ensure conr
sistent quality, and recent
setbacks cause by damage to local crops from
the ice storms lasr winter. “Dining Service
wants quality ﬁrsr and foremost, reliability
second and efficiency,” said Andelson. “From
rhcir srandpoint, local foods wasn’t delivering
on any ofthcm."

Six years later. Eli Zigas ’06 proposed that
Andelson lead an independcnr study to take a
serious look into the feasibility of incorporatr
ing a greater number or local foods inro the
dining hall, A group of 10 students signed
up for the class in the spring rind set to work
on a proposal for Dining Services. The result
was a seven-chapter proposal with suggesrions
tor changes in policy that Dining has impler
merited

Direcror ofDining services DickWilliams
credits the students from that independent
study class wirh creating a workable structure
that the department could use to incorptr
rarc locally produced food. “1 think from ihar
structure, we’ve been able to make more qual-
ity corrracrs wirh local producers," Williams
said.“And they've been able to provide us wirlr
quality and quantity products."

Advocarcs of local foods say that using
morc locally grown pr-odrrcrs in rlre dlnlrrg hall
supports the local {arm cconnnw, promotes
sustainable farming practices and aids in ct:
foits to iediice the environmental impact of
rhe college.

Tradirionally, qucsrions orcorrsisrcncy and
quality have dogged proponents of an increase
in local foods.Through working with srudcnrc
and the Grinncll Area Local Foods Alliance,

Dining Services was able to make contacts

Center has solved that

Directorof Dining Sewites objection. Now there is a

centralized location where
deliveries come in and one storcroom where
everything is kept until it is used.

To reﬂect this increased commitment to
local foods in the dining hall, Dining services
has dramatically increased the budget for local
food. in two years, spending on local foods has
increased from 361,000 to $120,000. Wale
tersdorf explained that this year that number
may not increase because of the ice storm in
February and the damage done to the apple
crop, one ofthe major foods Dining buys from
producers around Gtinncll.

The susceptibility of local foods ro weather
in addition to the relatively short growing sea—
son in Iowa means that there are some limita-
tions on how much more Dining services can
lean on producers to supply Grinnclls kitchr
ens. “A student will say I think you should
do more’ , "Williams said, [but] I really think
local food is geographically challenged
