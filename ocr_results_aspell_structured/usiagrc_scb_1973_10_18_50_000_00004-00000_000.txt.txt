Grinnell‘s second home loss against
a single victory. The Rams remain
undefeated and, with Knox dropping

Cornell’s delense, led by Francis
Wu, toiled scoring opportunities.
Late in the half, Cornell scored the
first goal of the match when Jeff
Camargo broke down right wing
and slipped the ball into the Grin-

The second half was more of the

by the Pioneer fullbacks that Cor-
nell had been off-sides, neither
referee saw it that way and Grin-
hell was two goals down.

Grinnell's only score, netted by
junior Don Noyce, followed shortly.
Noyce, who had missed the two
previous games, beat Ram goalie
Mike Stern to the ball and punched
it into the open not from 18 yards
out, The goal caused a ilurry of
exmtement and inspired the team,
but the time ran out eight minutes
later, assuring the pioneers oi a
losing season for the first time since
1970.

Grinnell didn’t play badly, Core
neII’s coach declared afterwards,
”You guys beat us to the ball ee
very time The games withyou were
deﬁnitely Our toughest Of the sea,
son,” That has been Grinnell’spror
hlem. Every week the pioneers have
played lairly well; yet all but once
they've been edged by one goal.

The past three games have seen
strong showings irom the pioneer
fullback line, Starters Roger
Kurnler, Glenn Cushing, and Ron
Spritzer and lourth man Rich Lan-
caster hr’il'le made life comparative—
ly easy for rookie goalleJohn l-laigh.
Offensive and midﬁeld difficulties
have hurt the club.

OSKALOOSA, IAv-The crosscoun~
try team traveled to meet William
Penn and Central in a 5 mile meet
puttting their undefeated season on
the line only to have their record
marred by a loss to Central and a
victory over Penn, This wa_s the
last dual meet and Grinnellv’s res
cord is a respectable 5»l.

The course was a very difficult
course with sharp dropotfs, muddy
hills, and 90 degree turns, Tom
Howland’s and Judah Garber’s leg
injuries added.to Grinnell’s prob—
lems, but the Central runners ran
very well and deserved the victory.

Central's Dave Waddle beat Dave
Raub by a good margin for ﬁrst
place. Clifford Clusin ran fairly
strong but couldn't overcome Cen-
tral’s Gary linger and chris Sam— ,
son. Clusln came in sixth. Russ
Camtoft came in the ninth position.
Mark Blanchard finished twelfthand
Bob Shields came in fourteenth

The team was very disappointed
in losing their undefeated season
especially when just two weeks ago
at the Les Duke Invitational Grin—
nell destroyed Central. In that race
Raub beat Waddle and Ungerfollow»
ed, all Clusin, Howland, Damtoft,
Gerber, and Blanchard all beat Cen»
tral’s Samson.

This Friday, Grinnell goes to Ce-
dar Rapids for the Coe Invitational.
The competition will come from
Central‘ again and Dubuque Univere
sity who beat Grinnell by three poir
nts at Les Duke. It is possible
for a championship and the Grin~
neIl crew would like a little rer
venge.

At a team meeting Dave Raub and
Torn Howland were voted to be the
co-captalns of the 1973 season.
