Mayerberg Outlines Liberal Jewish Faith

The six basic beliefs of the lib-

eral Jev‘vish church were outlined to attain peace in it. is the re- tli

foi- Grinncli students yesterday in
Herrick chapel, by Rabbi Samuel
S. Mayerberg of Kansas City. Mo.
Rabbi Mayerberg's address, en-
titled “What Do Jews Believe’I”,
was the first of a series planned
to broaden Grinnellians' knowledge
of the religions of the world.
Rabbi Mayerbcrg stated that the
Jewish declaration of faith affirm-
ed the “unity”, or iiidivisibility, of
lead, as well as His creative
‘powers. He added that the first
lprecept of his religion, and the
single, great» command in thc
lBible is to love and obey God.

The Jewish people, he said sec-

 

!sult of his failure to perceive and‘

to follow the right way of lite.
VHThOX‘E is no problem in the world
today," he added, “which couldn’t
be solved, it man used religious
,ideals in directing his life,"

The third concept, he wciit on.
is the belief that one's religious
ideals should be manifested in his
Icthical conduct: that is. not mere-
ly adheiing to a faith. but carry-l
ing out the doctrines of that faithl
in one's actions.

The fourth belief is that “to
Israel has been entrusted the mlSa
‘51011 of spreading the knowledge
and the doctrine of God through-

glondly, believe that God’s universe but the world.” Israel, now nu-
,ls perfect, and that man’s failure lucrioally the smallest nation inlduring peace."
