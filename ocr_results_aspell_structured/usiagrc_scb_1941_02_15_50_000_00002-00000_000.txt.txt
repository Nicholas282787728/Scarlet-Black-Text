And If We Do Fight

It is an unavoidable fact that the danger of‘

in establishing some sort of world order
which might have paved the way for a more

if public opinion, built around a zealous in,

principally by means of propaganda tech

Harris Sees Japan
As A Threat To

”American Peace

—By wullhm o. Burl-ls.

Since Herr Hitler first began
shifting European boundaries,
most normal Americans have (le-
voted most of their spare time
in dark contemplation: of Nazi
hordes swarming into Washing-
ton. Invasion fears, no matterhow
foolish from a military point of
View, have been so encouraged
by both official and lay sources
that the nation’s citizenry seems
ﬁrmly convinced that the great-
est and only real danger to
American peace lies in the Ger-
man armed forces.

With the developments of the
past few days, however, the in—
adequacy of this view is becom-
ing more and more opporent. For
it is increasingly evident that the
most active danger to the peace
of this nation hes, not on the
battle-fields of Europe, but in the
im- reaches of the Pacific.

War with Japan has long been
regarded in United States hovel
circles as o not-too-unweloomc
eventuality. And with world con-
ditions what they are, consider-
sble weight is lent to that school
of thought, two factors in parti-
cular indicating that this nation
is most likely to enter the
European squabble via. the Pacific
backdoor.

1n the first plume, with the co
mg of weouier suitable for m
tnry operations in Europe, Grout
Britain may he confidently ex-
pected io have adequate oppor-

tunitics for the employmem of
her entire sea power in European
waters. The Nazi preparations in
the Balkans, in northern France
and in Spain indicate only too
clearly that the continental spring
will be ,ixccompanied by huge
Gel-mun drives in ihe Meditei'rﬂm
em. region and across the English
channel.

To meet these expected on-

slaughts, Britain will need every
gun she can muster—a {act

which implies the withdrawal of

British force now concentrated

in Asiatic waters.

Such a Withdrawal would leave
a void which can be filled only
with American troops and ships.
And it IS commonly surmised
that arrangements have already
been made between London and
Washington for the filling of that
void. Thus it is that the growing
activity of Japan in the East
Indian region and the increasing
Nazi threat in Europe combine to
create a very real danger to
American pcsce.

Secondly, not only does there
exist a melt obligation for the
United States to «Islam Great
Britain's Asiatic possessions, but
Uncle Sam's own problem child,
the Philippines, offers lurther op-
portuniﬂes ior an American
.iilpnnese mix-up. For it is not
likely mat the United States will
sin-hi idly by while Japan plooes
herself in a pos ion enabling hei-
to capture the phlllppines at will.

That. these dangers are not the
more figment: of journalistic
imsgihslion can be inferred from
the strengthening of American
forces in the Far East which has
been progressmg for the post few
months as well as the constantly
occunng rumour that the U. S.
ﬂeet is preparing to move to
Singapore. Danger for America,
yes. But for greater in Tokio
than Berlin.

CRA CK-POT:

By Ken
Mathews and Pearce

It begins to look like Grinnell’s
social institutions are cracking
up one by one. First the White
House is quarantined, and now
Varsity dances are endangered by
lack of enthusiasm. In some halls
the galloping dominoes and dealer’s
choice are simplifying the social
problem.

While on the subject of the
White House, if its problem was
acute, it is how critical, all come
pressed in one room in the base-
ment.

Whoever gave the dorms and
quad their first breakfast with
sausages and eggs in eleven years
should get a bouquet. Things like
this should be encouraged.

Taking the disciplinary and
scholastic attitudes of D . Stevens
to hem-L, grades were ”given"
to the student body last Wednes-
clay.

Council should vote themselves
