Why we didn’t buy disco T~shirts

Last week, our school appropriately responded to a bias-
morivated incident with a campus wide email and workshop
to follow. In that same week another offensive term was print-
cd, only it was on hundreds of tee-shirts, each being sold for
$10,

The Disco XXI theme, “Saturday Night Beaver," is a disc
tasteful phrase anywhere, but to see it get promoted at a place
that values social justice as much as Grinnell College is espe-
cizlly bothersome. ‘Hustle 8c Blow,” the theme from 2007, is
similar to this years only in that it is a play on a movie title.
That title exempliﬁed what' we expect, with a clever play on
words,a nod to the decade culture and a truly funkadelic shirt,
none ofwhich rhis year’s Disco can claim without it being at

tionable for multiple reasons. First, it sends the false'message
that homosexuality is such a dcbaucherous practice ,
that it is only appropriate for a night when ”anything

violence that could imply unwanted sexual aggro?
sion is accepmhle on this oh so crazy ofa night.

We at the 55d! understand one of the main rea-
sons for the prevalence orrheme parties at Grinnell is to
transport us from our rural isolated setting and transport to an—
other world—{lie 1970s, say But during this process we should
never lose our let century values ofequaliry andgrespcct.

it provided the campus wirh music and drinks they would och-
tr'wisc not pay attention to.

' Most importantly, it was ﬁnally
great to have a wellrattended campus
party that wasn’r Americanecentric.

‘ Grinnelliarls have always had a knack

for coming up with creative parties;

however, [or too long we have ignored the

cultural importance of so many students. while Journey and

Lady GaGa are great choices for any night, it is im rtant for

students to branch out and celebrate where much ofPEur music

comes from. Furrher'more, every stop quenched our thirso with
libau'ons particular to each country.

With 10/10 raking place in the till, s ring semester had
been lacking the fresh air ota campus-wi e progressive party.
The south campus loggia was brimming all night with bright
faces from all over the Grinnell landscape. So job well done,

What to eat before eating and how to stay HPV-free

You’re not alone. Most people who enter the wonderful
world of oral sex at some point realize they shouldn't have or-
dered the garlic bread at Lheir romantic dinner.There are actu-
ally many foods and substances that will change the my you
taste—that goes for everybody, regardless of your equipment.
The party lifestyle doesn'r help: catreine, tobacco and hard
alcohol will all make the problem much worse, as will some
recreational drugs Like cocaine. Diets high in red meat, ﬁsh
and especially dairy are also likely to leave your parrner with
a frown (and yes, vegans have a reputation for having “good
taste"). There are other culprits; garlic, onions, cauliﬂower,
broccoli, junk food and the avoid—ar-any—cost ultimate mood
killer, asparagus.

There's good news, rhoughl Anything sugary and acidic,
like candy, juice and fruit (pineapple is a popular choice) will
help, make your emissions sweeter, and staying hydrated will
mellow the taste out. Even some spices like cardamom and cin-
namon are reputed to be effective, and of course playing with
flavored lube, whipped cream and chocolare syrup couldn't hurt
(but clean up well afterwards, or you risk a bacterial infection).
Popping a mint in your mouth before you start can be exciting
for both you and your partner. It'd be a great ﬁeld for some
experimental inquiry by our dear readers. Iryou REALLY care
about making your partner happy, though,you'l.l both ger fully
tested before deciding to have unprotected oral sex! Infections
ranging from annoying to liferlhreatcmng can be spread that
way, including herpes, hepatitis B, HPV and yeast infections.
We sell ﬂavored dental dams and lube at the SHIC, and we
should have ﬂavored condoms starring later this semester.

Finally, we want to remind-our readers that it’s very im-
portanl lo‘ﬁnd out it' your partner really wants to have oral

sex. Sexual contact is never ok if only one person wants it to
happen, and we all sometimes tell our partners we don’t want
to do things in indirect ways. Ityou occasionally remind them
that they never ever have to have an excuse to not want to do
something sexual, whar you do decide on will be that much
more exciting.

Dear SHIC,

Igor (b: Gordan? arcane At my [Art Jarrett appointment. D172:

Congratulations on taking an im orranr step to protect
yourself from Human Papillomavirus HPVlilhe most com-
mon sexually transmitted infection. You are indeed now safe
from the most common harmful forms of the virus. Various
strains of HPV can cause genital warts and cancer. currently,
50 percent ofscxually active adults will have some form ofHPV
at some point in their lives, and in 90 percent orthese cases, the
body will rake care of it within two years, usually without any
symptoms.

There is no cure for rhe virus other than your own immune

being sexually active in the future.

There are over 40 dichrcnt types of HPV and not all are
created equal. Some cause genital warts.Warts vary in appear-
ance—one small bump or severalﬁmall or large, raised, ﬂat or
cauliﬂower shaped. Warts do not cause cancer and can either
be treated or left to go away on their own. Rarely HPV may
also cause warts in the throat, a condition known as rgmrrent
remiruzmypapillomamit or RRP. Many stmins of HPV have no
medical repercussions at all, but where the virus gets serious is
its potential to cause cancer, The link between HPV and cervi-
cal cancer is well-documented and widespread. The cancer risk
is not limited to women (or their cervixes), however; because
different types of HPV can also cause cancers of the vulva, va—
glna, penis, anus and head and neck, including tongue, tonsils
and throat.

The vaccines are most effective before you become sexually
active. HPV is spread through vaginal, oral and anal sex. Any
extensive skin-«rskin conracr can transmit it, even non-genital
contact (ﬁngers, etc.) and it may be passed on when neither
person has symptoms nor is aware ofari infection.This means

 

system. However, with HPV, as wirh
most health issues, prevention is the
best medicine. The FDA has ap-
proved two vaccines to protect against
HPV. Both Vaccinations come in a
series of three shots over a period of
six monrhs, and your immunization is l ,

Any sexually active person is at a high risk otgetting HPV.
The HPV vaccine is available from your doctor, or from a re-
producnve health care provider such as Planned Parenthood or
Central lovva Family Planning. sexually active women should
schedule regular Pap rests, hecause rhe srrain of HPV that
causes cancer can only be detected by changes in cervical cells.
There is no FDA approved HPV test for male-bodied indie
viduals, so rhc only thing our male readers can do is make sure
they and their partners gcr vaccinated as soon as possible.
