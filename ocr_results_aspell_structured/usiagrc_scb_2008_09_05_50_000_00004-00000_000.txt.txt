Floods miss campus

HYJEFF RADERSTRONG
This summer, around 40,000 Iowans were
displaced by ﬂoodwaters throughout the state.
The nation watched as people in places such
as Iowa City and Cedar Rapids sandbaggcrl in
an attempt to spare their communities from

ﬂooding acmally occurrcd from rains on July
27, said Mark Cedar, director of Facilities
Management

The damage was not severe and re uired a
“more routine" clean up, Godat said. “ It was]
mostly wet vacuuming the water and using the
derhumidifier to reduce humidity," he stud.

The buildings that required the most clean
up after the July storms were the Forum, the
Old Glovc Factory and
Gardner Lounge, accord—
ing to Cedar.

Where Bishop did
see some of the effects of
the June ﬂoods that shut
down parts ofls80 was at
his internship at the Nat-
uial Resource Conserva-

lan Bishop’lO

tion Service.

He wolkcd with farmers in Jasper county
and visited a house outside of Colfax after the
ﬂood. "The water line was 20 feet away from
the horrsc,"Bishop said,

Bishop and some friends went to Iowa
City to help sandbag and he was impressed at
the volunteer response.

"We had to go to see [the ﬂoods],"Bishup
said,“but it was safe around here."
