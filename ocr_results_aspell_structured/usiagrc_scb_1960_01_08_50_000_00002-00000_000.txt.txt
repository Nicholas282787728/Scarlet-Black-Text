Coed Dinil'lgi '- Solulion 0r Farce?

Coed dining begins tllis week! Undoubtedly this will
be met with varying degrees of enthusiasm, if any at all.
We feel that this is an opportune time to reﬂect some of
the opinions heard on campus and promulgate some of our

When Joe College pays $430 for board at Grinnell, we
believe that Mr. College should have something to say con-
cerning where and with whom he shall eat. In our opinion,

To the Editor:

During the past few weeks,
the ever-increasing lunch line
at the Quad has become so ex~
tensive that the amount of dead
time spent waiting is inordinate-
ly long. The enlarged student
body has understandably put a
sizable burden upon the facili-
ties for serving cafeterizlrstyle
meals. Also, one of the few so~
cial opportunities provided at
Grinnellslunohing with u guy—-
adds to the initial stl‘a

Our dispute, however, lies
with a traditional spoils-system
—granting Saga’s student-work-
ers the privilege of “cutting
line.” We do not mind privi—
leges, especially well-deserved
ones, but when a privilege in-
conveniences the majority of
women students, it is a usurpa-
lion The nsurpers are mainly
non-working waiters and wait-
resses from both the Quad 2nd
Cowles

The privileged employees of
Saga have an opportunity to eat
early dinner whenever they
please This does not affect the
great number of students who

Jung”

are imposed upon during lunch.
We feel that the waiters and‘
waitresses who do not Work
lunch should experience the‘
same empty-stomached aggrava-
tion of a lengthy, unmoving
line.

We have heard the Complaint‘
that the low wagcs paid the
student-employees of Saga is the
lrational justifying the policy of
line-cutting. What about the
other working students on cam-
pus? They receivc the same base
wage. Shouldn’t they have access
to this privrlege'! What about
the students with heavy course-
loads? Their time is also lim-
ited, so why not have everyone
cut line? The lunch line would
then become a “cutting line,"
and we all could enjoy equal
opportunity!

it has been brought to our.
.attention that several students
‘nnve even made the effort to
have their names placed on the
Saga “sub"-1'lst.
Give us white aprons!
