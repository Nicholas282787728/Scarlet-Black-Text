"The French Home in Its Relation to

Prof. Macy that the

Tire English. he said, started that idea,
hut the iact is that the French home is
the strongest rcntor in French lite and
it has the greatest indnencc upon polir

French have an intimate, close and
sacred idea 0! home lite, so much so
that it is almost impossihle for o Torr
ciguel' to outer into the lite or a French
home,

The circtt o[ the French home upon
