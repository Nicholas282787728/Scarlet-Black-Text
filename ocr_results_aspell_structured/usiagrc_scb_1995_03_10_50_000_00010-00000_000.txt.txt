HE basbeall learn was unable
to play its first game of the
season on Saturday, but the

team should see action soon enough.

The team was scheduled to take
on non-conference foe William Penn
College last weekend but the game
was cancelled because of the cold
weather. _

“The ground was frozen and we
didn‘t want to endanger anyone's
teeth or anything," said Coach Tim
Hollibaugh.

Hollibaugh said that he hoped to
reschedule the game for early April,
but thatadate wasn‘tcertain. Matchr
ing schedules and arranging umpires
can be difﬁcult. he said.

Although the team won’t see
Penn until April. it should be playing
more than six games over Spring
Break. Since these aren’t conference

games, Hollibaugh plans to use them
for training.

“Its important to get in game
situations because of all the indoor
work [the team has been doing]," he
said.

Hollibaugh doesn’t really know
what the season looks like yet. but he
has high expectation for his players.

“If you judge it on enthusiasm
and hard work, we should be ter-
riﬁc," he said.
