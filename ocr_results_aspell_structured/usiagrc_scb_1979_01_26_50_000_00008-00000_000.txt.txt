"After a While in Grinnell, it is
like at battery has no down , it

political science professor Wayne

that is the purpose of faculty
leaves‘ to I‘eeh e and refresh
facu non-iber well as to "add
to their protessioiiai stature, and
“to broaden their ex ei'ience."
according to the liyrla s of the
Board of Trustees iii the Faculty

PHYSICS PROFESSOR Beryl

WHILE MOST professors prefer
to leave Grinnell during their
leaves, some choose to conduct
research within the confines of the
Grinnell College community.

During his semesterrlong sab
batical last year, English professor
James Kissane Wrote an article on
T. S, Eliot's ”Wasteland” and
worked on a series of essays about
the English novel,

ALTHOUGH FOREIGN travel is
refreshing, broadening and
educating. says Kissane. even a
“dry sabbatical” at home offers 21
changc of routine and a chance to
get caught up in one‘s field, He
adds, “It’s niceto getaway. but it‘s

spring to continue his research on i

financially very difficult, and it's
invonvenient to reiocate a family."

chemistry professor Joseph
Danforth, as well as physics
professor Wayne Denny, chose not
to leave town. They are currently
on sabbatical and are conducting
research in their respective fields
in the Grinnell College
laboratories.

ACADEMIC PRESSURE falls
not only on students at Grinnell;
professors also feel the strain of
heavy course loads, McCarthy and
Clotfeltcr recognize the relief
leaves offer train the heavy
teaching loads. McCarthy said that
mie's ”job can become your whole
life." and that to remain an ef-
fective teacher it IS ncees ’ “

HOWEVER, TIIIS situation may
change: Walker desires the
establishment of a system of ap—
proval or denial of sabbatical
leaves, and he informed the
Executive Council at last Wed-
nesday’s meeting of his
displeasure with the existing lack
of requirements

Walker asserts, “There should
be some method devised to Show
the iaculty member that we expect
lilm or her to do something with his
or her development.”

TO ACHIEVE that goal, Walker
advocates the development ot a
board of recommendation which
decides whether or not a proiessor
qualifies for a leave llowcvcr.
Walker has offered the Executive
Council no concrete proposal tor a
change in the status qtio

Walker is concerned that “some

CLOTFELTER VIEWS a mild
policy which would require
professors to state how they plan to
spend their time off as not
unreasonable, but states. “I prefer
to see the sabbatical viewed as
something which is earned by
teaching a certain period of time.”
Moyer says, “Even the most
recreational sabbatical can be
beneficial "

Walker, however disagrees,
feeling that a “sit- the-sun
sabbatical” is not a legitimate use
of the leave. The establishment of a
system to approve or deny leaves
would be a statement of the
college's position that laculty
members ought to develop them-
selvcs professionally while on
leave. 'he believes

The increase in tldliiiiiistraiivc

Walker is concerned that some faculty members

do not take sabbatical leaves seriously and

professionally. A [910 faculty members,

according to Walker, have used their leaves

‘as bred/es, not in scholarly ways.’

Kissane. "One needs ti e to get
away, to do something that
requires full concentration for [I
while," says Clotfelter, and if one
is in a rapidly changing iield it is
helpful to have the opportunity to
catch up, According to Mayer, ”Iii
Grilinell there are limits to in-
tellectual interaction” and it lS
useful to have “scholarly discourse
with the mainstream.”

Some professors find that the
work they complete on leave has a
direct effect in the classroom upon
their return. Kissane hopes to
incorporate some of his sabbatical
findings into his course on the
British novel.

LEAVES ARE also essential for
maintaining the effectiveness of
foreign language professors,
Because language changes
rapidly. leaves are necessary to
“keep you up on modern language
usage." says McCarthy.

Moyer states that work at
another educational institution
allows one to “develop a more
sophisticated (classroom)
methodology," New courses may
stem from research done on leave,
adds Mohan.

ALTHOUGH REID found it
helpful to “get away from
academic and theoretical
economics to actual practice,” he
says, “I found no direct translation
between what I did in Washington
and what I do here."

At the present time, there are no
requirements regarding leaves,
Although faculty members do
inform Dean Waldo Walker of their
leave plans, all qualified faculty
members are automatically
granted leave According to
Walker. no research proposals are
required, and therefore leaves are
currently “retrospective, not:
prospective."

satisfaction with what Mayer calls
a "good and generous sabbatical
policy," is Widespread, and he
views any attempt to regulate
faculty sabbatical: as “in some
ways an insult "

“IS there really a problem of
people abusing their sabbaticals'?”
asks Moyer. “I'd really like to
know there is a problem before we
start doing something,”

control wnicn would result from a
more stringent leave policy also
disturbs faculty members. Kissane
says that such a policy would be
”unfortunate" and a possible
"source of friction and invidious
comparison,"

whether spent abroad or right
here in Grinnell, leaves give
professors a chance to shift gears
and to recharge their batteries.
