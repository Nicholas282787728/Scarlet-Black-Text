Some think he was a Scotchman. That

spoke oi the authentic record which
exists concerning St. Patrick’s life,
adding this astute remark, that “True
as it no doubt is that St. Patrick
trausiornied lrclaud, it is equally true
that Ireland has transformed St. Pat-
rick.” , :

After discussing some of the myths
which surround the fame of the great
Irish hero, Lovell drew the obvious
conclusion that this lantastic streak in
Irish literature shows the dependence
which a great people plnces upon
dreams as opposed to tocts, in a,
splendid eulogy to the "Disciples at
St. Patrick," a eulogy which was not
entirely devoid 01 humor. however,
Professor Lovell characterized the
irishman as having an “intense iaith
and an intense emotion, an unwilling-

absorption in one idem" this last
phrase. according to Lav-ell, being the

ANNA CASE APPEARS IN
CHARMING SONG RECITAI.

Uliumx oi iii-suing s llcuclrcd in Her
Extﬁisito Interpretation oi
“Song oi lndiu."

_ (By Bernard Craven)

From the moment she came on the
platform, stunningly gowned in cloth
oi silver and rope oi pearl, Anne Case
captivated ii. large audience in Her-
rick chapel last evening, Her per-
sonal charm was exceeded only by her
vocal prowess. She would be equal—
ly as popular on the legitimate stage,
for her eveiy expression and gesture
created the atmosphere of her songs.

Her first number, Handel's "Angels
Ever Bright and Fair," was sung with
it power that was startling, and with
a depth and clearness of tone that
was maintained throughout the pro-
gram. Never before have we had the
chance to witness at close range, such
perfect breath control, the basis or the
technique or a real vocal artist. To
hear her Sing in French W115 RS good
as a lesson in French pronunciation,

“Lo head Reva" by E‘leg‘ler and Nera
inl’s "L’insect Aile" were sung with an
air as delicate us the wing of a. butter-
fly or the fleeting beauty or a dream
which the words of the songs deson‘b-
ed. Mozart's “Alleluja” proved that
one word can he inspirational when
obloreturized by Anna case, Puccini's
aria from La Boheme. "Ml Chinamaho
Mimi", was not as effective as we
have sometimes heard it, but the dis
appointment was iorgottcn in the en-
core.

Anna Case reached her climax last
evening in that gem of oriental inel-
odles, “Song of India" by Rimsky-Kor-
sskov, The audience remained
breathless for several moments after
she had finished, so exquisite had been
the interpretation.

The last group of songs were dra—
mutlc hits, greatly appreciated by the
audience. especially "day" by “finite!

Ralph Angeli, until he began to make

group.
