our girls are not troubled irom Duke s

rate we nor-er heard or such being the
case at an athletic contest.

What is inlinitely worse is that

t seems to have even lnvade'd
the team. Perhaps this is‘ due to the
attitude or the student body, yet that
does not excuse the team.

We all know that the team is green
and inexperienced and that victories
cannot be expected over veteran
teams, yet we do say that no team ior
several years pit. has been more re
presentatire ol‘ Grinnellthan the pres
ent one. The rneir asa rule wrro are
playing today, are here, for some other
purpose than to play football. Footr-
ball is merely an incident in their
college course.

No fault can be round with the coach
for he has done all that mortal rnair
could do with the material at hand,
and the wonder is that he has succeed—
ed so well.

It. is sad to admit it, yet neverthe
less it is true: Grinnell has the college
muckcr. There are certain iellorvs
wiio know nothing or the game and
its tribulations and who never donned
a uniiorm, yet these same tellows tallr
wisely and complain every time the
team loses. Tiirs is not a time ior
kicking, hutatiin’e wlren every stir-
dent shorild rally to the support or
the team. Show them that you are
with them, win or lose, and that they
can depelltlon your support, and then
some day, things will change.
