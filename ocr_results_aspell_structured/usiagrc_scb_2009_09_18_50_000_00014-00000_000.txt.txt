Grappling
fighting its way
onto campus

BYELIZA-EVE LEAS

Martial Arts aren't exactly pievalent on Grinnell's campus.
Fighting, even organized fighting, is seen as bruhil. or a blood
sport. But Grappling. a descendant of Brazilian JiuJitsut has
taken a firm hold over two Grinncllians.

Last weekend, Ian Wurlick '10 and David Paige ’0‘) com—
peted at the Sasquatch Open, a Brazilian jia-jitsu tournament
in Newton. Paige placed sccond in the 145 and under weight
class, and Warliclt placed third in the 18S and under weight
class.

“The goal is to put your opponent on the ground,"Warlick
said. “The [goal of] submission wrestlng is that 1 want to pin
my opponentil want to move to a dominant position and
then I want to ﬁnd something to make them hurt so bad that
they’ll quit or rap out."

So, no. Grappling isn't gratuitously vicious, but it's certainly
exciting, Warlick and Paige entered the tournament without
much ofan idea of how they would place.

“I ended up going 1- 2," Warlick said. I was really happy
with myself, Iwrestled three guys and I was able to submit a
guy. Both [me and Paige] are pretty happy with how things
went."

\Varhck lost his ﬁrst match to the eventual champion, and
was defeated late in his third match to a submission. I: was
in his second match that Warlick got an advantage against his
opponent.

"1 was able to get myselfback into the second match," said
Warlick, who attributes his success to composure and endur-
ance, “I was really patient, so that went well."

Warlielt :tnd Paige have only been training for two and
three years, respectively, and this was the first competition for
both of them.

“I've never been to a Brazilian Jiurjitsn school," warlick
said “I’ve never trained formally. I've never taken any formal
lessons in any martial arts,"

Warlick began to learn about Grappling and Brazilian Jiu»
jitsn from Paige two years ago, They now work together two or
three times a week, miming four minute matches and practic-
ing different positions. Tliey draw a lot from onlinc instruction
and videos and try out ideas with each other.

“After a while, he became more or less my equal and we
started training together,” Paige said. In fact, it's common for
warlick to beat Paige now, because of his extra height and

weight.

“I think that a lot of this is just us making it up as we go.
There’s no real structure, no real teacher,"Warlick said.

Warlick and Paige both competed at the intermediate divir
sion last weekendThe Sasquatch Open was divided into di
sions by years of experience and Warliek fell tight at the bor-
derline between beginner and intermediate. Warlick said the
differences between himselfand those with more formal train-
ing and experience were clear. one thing that putWarlick at a
disadvantage was not cutting weight—he could have competed
in the urtdcrel70 weight class, but ended up in the underriss
by three pounds

“[At my level] there's a lot oflooking attd seeing,‘Well.what
is my opponent doing and where are my hands ntxl can’t work
through things just by feel,l have to look," Warlick said, “It

won't look at their opponent they won’t look at what they're
doing. They do it all based on just my body against yours and
feeling their way through that. I’m still very much learning in
all of this."

Both Paige and Warlick plan to continue practicing, and
will be competing again next spring. After swimming season
ends, Warlick might be practicing in a more structured setting.

“I’ll probably start traveling down to Iowa city once a week
to train [with students at the University of Iowa] ,"Warlick said.

one of the founders of Brazilian jiu Jitsu, Helio Graciei
trained up until his death earlier this year, at the age of 9s.
warlick has the same plan.

“I'd like to do it for the rest ofmy life,"Warl.ick said. “I’d like
to do it until I can't anymore. It's been fun and I think that's
the biggest thing."

 

 

Get a Grip

 

 

 

on Grappling

“Grappling is a lot like wrestling or judo or
anything like that," Ian Wulick said. The whole
goal is to push your opponent to the point where
they can’t handle your attack anymore. .

To this end, gmpplets use joint locks, pressure lode
and choke holds to get your opponent to submit or tap
our. lrsubmiision isn't achieved during the match, the
wimm is decided by points, which are scored by put-
ting your adversary in compromising positions.

while size is a major factor weight classes al-
low for highly skilled individuals to take on bigger
fighters who rely on dieii size and weight.

In order to keep the sport safe, a lot of trust
must be placed‘ in the hands ofyour challenger.

“You trust your opponent to know what he‘s
doing,’ War-lick said. They trust you to know
what youre doing You trust the referee to know
what they re doing"

 

§eason srzZling for Women’s Tennis team

BY MAX CALENBERG

After winning seven out of eight matches,
the Grinncll Women's Tennis Team is just
about halfway through the regular season rid-
ing strong. The hot start impressed several
teams and coaches, Coach Andy Hamilton
’85 included.

“Ifyou would’ ve asked me ifwed be 7 1 at
~this point before the season started," Hamilr
n said,’ I [would have] said no way’"
While Hamilton may be pleasantly sur»
used by the success, he knows Exactly what
rsrems from—experience.
,rtt"We are blending a pretty experienced
of five returners with two ﬁrst years,"
oqsaid. ‘Sp far that‘s been the reason

.plzly‘er stepped
up in order to ensure a Victory for the team.
For' instance, there was Liza Spears” 11 critical

win in a tiebreakcr to seal the 54 overall ream
victory against Cornell College. Or Captain
Jill Akiyarna '10, who moved to third doubles
while fighting a rib cage injury that forced her
to serve undcrhand and still won her match
with partner Kelsey Picken 10 against Knox
College and the University of Wisconsin—
Steven’s Point.

Akiy ama knows these individual successes
and they success ofth: team has been great for
the womens’ mental game.

“Starting out with seven straight wins has
given everyone so much conﬁdence," Akiyama
said. Especially the freshmen, who havent
played at this level before, are seeing that they
can compete.

Many of the Pioneer’s victories were close,
yet Hamilton sees that as an advantage.

“We will benefit having already been in

some close matches," Hamilton said. “Being
in close matches early in the season allows
us to be comfortable in the inevttably close
matches ofthe conference championship."

The Pioneers, weakened by injuries and
playing in their ﬁrst weekday game ofthe sea-
son, lost the ﬁrst match to W burg College
by a score on 1 on Toesda . ciuierine Fitch
’13, who was disappointed by. e loss, does
not see a defeat' in the team's. tfitude. . -.

“we liked the idps ofb ’ g undefca .
Fitch said. “Now mét we know what it’s 1392
to'lose, we will try even harder against C‘
[College]. ’

The squad will face some tough non-co
ference competition when they face the Di-
sion lII nationally ranked Coe College, at 10
a. m. tomorrowSep t 19 at home Lastyear, the
