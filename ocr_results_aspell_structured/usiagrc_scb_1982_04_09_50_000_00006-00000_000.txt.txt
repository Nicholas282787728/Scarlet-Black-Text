show their talent

by Patty lsacson

For such a small college in such a tiny
Midwestern town, Grinnell can certainly
boast of attracting students from all over
the world. Ghana and Zimbabwe, Pakistan
and Peru, Switzerland, Columbia,
Jamaica and Laos are Just a iew oi the
countries that some Grinnell students
call home Although ioreign students come
here to absorb American culture, they are
also willing and eager'to share the customs
of their own native countries. In Gardner
Lounge this Saturday at 7:30 p.m,, the in
ternational Students Organization tiSOi
will present a talent show to introduce
Gl‘ll’ll‘lell to their diverse cultures through
song, dance and instrumental perior-
mance. .

Karin Stem, who coordinated the talent
show, called it “an activity to make the
campus community more aware ot us "
She remarked that some of the members
of the lSD have real talents and that this
show gives them “ n opportunity to ex
press themselves. One oi the par
tictpants, Chl‘isty Laird, added that the
show would “give people a taste or our
cultures by giving them the opportunity to

see these periormances,"
Ten members or the 150 are scheduled

., neriorm Saturday evening. Edward

D'Souza and Rutendo Mantiziba will per
form a song from South Airica. and Luis
Moreno and Stein wtll sing a South
American tune with calyspo origins. Paul
Brown will read a Jamaican poem and
sing the popular song, “Matilda,"

The dances periormed will be as widely
different as the countries from which they
come. Noy Siackhachanh will present two
Laotian dances and German Assistant An»
ton Burgener and Christy Laird will pair
up in a traditional Austrian folk dance,
During this dance the couple must not let
go of each other's hands, although the
steps involve much twisting and turning,

A percussion periormance is the unique
offering of Kwabena AntwlrLarbi. a native
of Ghana. Finally Anne Richards has
brought her talent in composition to some
Old French lyrics to Create a song which
she will perform,

This is the last major event which will be
sponsored by the 130 this year and it pro
mises to provide an interesting hour or
two. Stein, who will be performing a C01-
ombian song which she says “means a lot
to me," perhaps hits on the right tone of
the evening when she says or her native
country, "I love it and I Want to shale It "

. When it appeared in 197i] this Academy
Award winning comedy tor Best Foreign
Film reaiiirmed just about evei-yhody's
iaith in French comedy. which tends
sometimes to get weighed down in the
traditional aristocraticrsentimentalrlarce
motif. Get Out Your Handkerchiefs is far
cicial now and then. but it is mostly a sure
prising, original and enJoyable comedy of
love comeraderie,

Thestory centers primarily on a woman
who is constantly depressed-and collapses

periodically from dizziness and whose hus~ '

band will do anything, including enlist a
stranger he meets as a potential lover. to
hie her train the depths. The stranger.
Stephe'i, Can do nothing to revive her, but
the two men are united in their increasmgr
ly desperate frustration and a common
comic madness until one gets the reeling
they should love each other rather than the
woman, Solange Bul they are possessed
by her uniathomable mystery. and can one
ly keep struggling ior her. Eventually they
all go off to manage a summer camp iull oi
screaming childien, one oi whom. oddly
enough, begins to aiiect Solange. From
here the movie tumbles increasingly into a
frantic farce, as complications and
mishaps continue to arise.

Throughout, though. the film is united by
a bizzare and disconnected comic sense
reaching its peak with the two men, At one
point they vent their anguish in a pas-
sionate absorption in a Mozart piece All
the actors are marvellous and the film
gains much or its energy irom their in-
teraction, It has been remarked that the
film is rather blatantly sexist in its pol”
trayal of woman as the mysterious object
of all of man‘s attention, but given the
movie as a whole, there are perhaps other
ways to look at it. Think while you enjoy!

an important cinematic achievement,
John and Anita, a driiting sea captain and
a cafe waitress, both bitter from past
loves, overcome their own egos and reser-
vations to make peace and love. On this
subtle coming together of limited, simple
people, Lindgren leaves all eloquence to
the camera, an intimate observer, Yet the
progressions and many facets oi the rela-
tionship are vividly drawn. His technique
and virtues in dealing with physical ine
timacy are typically Swedish in their
irankness and honesty, The grace and
subtlety with which Lindéren has lllled his
movie makes this a seemingly eiiortless
iilm, asmali. but atiecting, celebration oi
the commonplace: 7 Catherine lngrassia

The Fearless .
Vamnlre Killers

llln mint

\ampire Killers. an early Polanski ef
fort. is such a bad film that it's almost en
joyable — a classic in camp. Alter th
release of this film in the United States.
Polanski requested his name not be men
tioned in connection with it. which should
be a clue right there Allegedly a spool on
all the old vampire movies, \‘anipire
Killers is neither spooky nor spooiy. Polan
ski stars as the inevitable assistant to the
equally inevitable mad proiessor rJack
MacGowrant who comes to Translyvania
armed with garlic and Crucifixes tI
obliterate the local vampires These blood-
thirsty iiends kidnap the partially clothed
Sharon Tate, whose picturesque tub-bath
will be the highlight of the film for some.
Ultimately Polanski et. a1. rescue her and
you can iigure out the rest. Essentially.
this film is a witless travesty not at all on
par with any or Polanski's later work
However, if approached with the right at-
titude or viewed in an altered state Yarn»
pire Killers could be fun, Just don't expect
too much. 7 Catherine Ingrassia
