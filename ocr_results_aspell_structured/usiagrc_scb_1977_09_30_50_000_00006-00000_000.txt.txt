The Conformisl. Bernardo
Bertolucci's adaptation of Alberto
Moravia’s famous novel about the
making of a Fascist, published in
1933, was the film that first brought
Bertolucci to the American
public’s attention. Since The
(‘mtlormist's release in 1971.
revivals of The Spider's Stratagem
and the release of Last Tango in
Paris have established this
director as a film-maker of lyrical
and poetic gifts. One critic calls his
work “an extraordinary com»
bination of visual richness and
visual freedom,” These qualities

are evident in The Contormist's
creation of a period atmosphere,
the romantic and baroque Thirties
in Italy.

The protagonist is Marcello
Clerici, played by Jeaanouis
Trintignant. Marcello is a onetime
liberal with a ,sordid history. His
father has gone insane, his mother
is a dope-addict. and he himself
believes that when he was 13, he
killed a man making homosexual
advances to him. He is
simultaneously attracted and
repulsed by perversion, both erotic
and political. l-le desires to escape

his contusion by losing himself 'in
the massesiand in Italy in the
1930’s, Fascism was the mass
movement. Alter Marcello agrees
to be an assassin for the Fascists,
he finds he cannot slip into their
normalcy as easily as he would
have like. Stefania Sandrelli is his
bland wife (one of the film’s best
scenes is her tearlul wedding night
confession of her one premarital
love affair— 'ch lasted six
years) and Domi que Sanda is his
erotic loverrlesbianrvictim.

When an interviewer asked

Hepburn, “If Tracy was a baked
potato, what are you?“ Kate
replied, “I’m a dessert, ice cream
with chocolate sauce."

The public adored the com-
bination of Spencer ﬁacy and
Katherine Hepburn. perhaps
because the film battles and
courtships of the pair were so
obviously sincere. They achieved
an onscreen intimacy so strong

that the Viewer could begin to [eel .

like a voyeur. Hepburn portrayed
the kind of woman not often seen in
early filmsibrilliant, sexy. and
tiercely independent. And Tracy
was tough enough to handle anyone

in the world—except Hepburn.

In Woman of the Year, Tracy
playsa sportswriter who marries a
super-intelligent political coma
mentator, Hepburn. Only after
they leave the altar does Tracy
discover that his bride intends to
change nothing in her life to ac-
commodate marriage. She makes
civil rights speeches, long-distance
phone calls and a political name
for herself. while he stumbles
around the kitchen and buys
himselfa new hat. This unorthodox
screenplay was written by Ring
Lardner Jr., who was one of the
unjustly treated Hollywood Ten.

the Chicago Theological Seminary.
He assumed his first ministerial
position in a western suburb of
Chicago.

FRENCH described the ministry
as “the most demanding and
diiiicult of all professions." One of
the most common problems is
trying to operate with a low
budget, much of which comes from
the pockets of Wellrtono people
who “seldom or never attend'
tchurch) but who cut off their
contributions when they hear of
something oi which they disap»
prove.” French shares a minister’s
often painful awareness that what
is offered by the church in the
name oi God is not all it could be
because oi inadequate physical

But on the positive side, French
finds the ministry a profession that
allows him to reach out to people
and lead them in the direction of
their “ultimate loyalty.” He also
sees himself pursuing “the en-
deavor on which the institutions of
society depend."

FRENCH Iel’t Chicago In 1940,
and served first at a Colorado State
Rel‘ormatory, and later as a social
worker at 3 Toledo Juvenile Court.
He found these experiences highly
stimulating because they added
“flesh and bone to theological
theory.”

By 1954, however, French and his
wife desired to find a more normal

environment in which to bring up
three young children. They moved
to Decatur, Illinois, where French
spent eight productive years obr
taining a doctor's degree and the
reputation of a therapist among
ministers.

BY 1962, the children had grown
up, and French was anxious to try
out a new and challenging position
as the chaplain oi Menard prison in
Chester, Illinois. He has written a
series of articles for the Herald
Register which summarizes his
experiences at Menard, He

French described the Illinois
prison system as ”a happy hunting
ground for political patronage." At
the end of his liveyear term, at
Menard the results of the system
became apparent in a tragic prison
riot French iound himself symr
pathizing more and more with the
inmates and “had to leave the
prison system in order to regain a
healthy mind,”

, In 1967 French moved to a
lministerlal position in Chicago.
The Vietnam war was then at its
peak, and French, a pacifist and

former C0 during World War II,

had nothing good to say about
Vietnam on or off the pulpit. He
wrote a paper with the thesis that
America’s involvement in Vietnam
represented part oi an effort to
preserve our expanding frontier by
dominating Southeast Asia and
Latin America. Also he was one of
live to submit a petition against the
installation of an ICBM base near
Chicago. A favorable court ruling

against the installations elsewhere

FRENCH remained In Chicago
until 1974. when his Wife, daughter
of the former Professor Connard
for whom the Grinnell biology
preserve is named, inherited a
house here in town.

They have lived a relaxed life
here. French describes his favorite
hobbies as yardwork and
bicycling. He has also become
involved in community affairs as
the President of the Ministerial
Association and as the organizer ot
the “Poweshiek Peddlers” bicycle
club. He is on the Board of
Education for the Grinnell United
Church of Christ, where he
preaches an occasional sermon.

French is also becoming active
in college lite. He is auditing a
Humanities 247 course on “In-
dustrialism and Imperialism," and
will speak at Steiner at 7:00 pm,
