. in response to Ellen Weinstock’s
April 19 column, I have a nomination
rfor “the most lawful cultural result of
the seventies." the trivial nature of
‘feminism at Grinnell. As most women
on campus know. the raging debate‘ in
the third stall of Burling Women s
Restroom wall is between the
backpacks and the purses. The debate
tbegan with a question posed by what is
apparently an upperclasswoman. She
sasks. “Today I saw a treshwoman car-
'rying both a purse and a backpack.
'Could someone please explain?" One
,anonymous person responded as
follows. “Hey. I thought Grinnell was a
.place where you don’t have to explain
anything to anybody! Signed Freshman
with backpack only but who knows peo-
pie with backpacks and purses. they
don t pry into anybody s motives. " Un-
tdoubtedly. it was an upperclasswoman
who made the call to “Grinnellize
‘lreshwomenf' And again it was pro-
bably some infinitely wise and witty up-
perclasswoman who made the state
.ment “Yeah. they lireshwomenl were
all made by the same manufacturer
‘and this manufacturer has very little
creativity Personally my iavorite me

,guys but the women have the relation-
ships. speaking as a woman who never

quite an airect on the shorts scenery; a
reporter from the Des Moines Register
who covered Relays that year made at
least one comment about the number of
unshaven legs running about Grinnell

about a conversation i had one day at
the water fountain with lra Strauber
the infamous Political Science Pros
tessor. You see. i was rather confused
about a headline in the Scarlet and
Black referring to a talk Strauber gave
in South Lounge on abortion. The
headline read ”Abortion. Not a Moral
issue." Well. I read the article and
didn't understand how Strauber came
to that conclusion.

As Strauber carried back his mug of
Water to his office and attempted to
pour it into his Mr. Coffee machine. he
explained that he was responding to the
Roe versus Wade decision on abortion.
Strauber contends that the case was
decided upon appropriately. According
to Slrauber. there is “no way to resolve
the issue of abortion from a moral
perspective because there is no shared
moral consensus on what
decriminalilation of aboriton is about.
Whatever political rights there are
about abortion. they have It) be Justified
