Are You Scotch?

If your father had paid for a new pell
and pencil set and had it delivered to yollr
door for your own use witll no obligation
whatsoever, would you refuse to accept that
gift? We scarcely need bother answering
that question. of course, you say “No!”

We admit our lecture course and our
musical program for the year can hardly be
called a pen alld pencil set. But the com—
bined entertainment program presented on
this campus costs for an individual the same
as a set.

Our point is this. If you wouldn’t re—
fuse the gift of a pen and pencil, why refuse
the gift of a program which will bring to
you this year such noted people as Emil Lud-
wig, the Vienna choir boys, Lucie Stern and
many others.

Each year the lecture course committee
and the department of music bring famous
people to the campus for your benefit at no
extra expense to you. Each year there are
a few students who attend none of the per—
formances.

The ancient plea that “You miss one of
the most important cultural phases of col-
lege life” when yoll fail to hear all the pro-
gram is still true~truer than ever. But the
plea is trite and falls on deaf ears. Anyone
can figure it out for himself.

Therefore, we purposely have written
this from a practical, financial standpoint.

If you are not Scotch enough to heed
the warning of lost investments, woe to you!
You‘d better find yourself a nice planet for
a hiding place.

A Moth in the Flame

We are in complete accord with the
state department on their decision to remove
the American embassy staff from Nanking.
There is no disgrace in the action alld it is a
step which will do away with an occasion
for an “incident” which might possibly lead
us into war.

So long as there are Americans in the
war zone, however, there is the possibility
of an “incident” leading inevitably to diplo-
matic protests and possible hostilities Surely
the government has done about enough pro-
tecting of American interests in China.
Warnings have been issued repeatedly to
American citizens and our navy has been
standing by for weeks to remove them to
safety. _ . _

Granted that if one had been living in
China for some time and had his busilless
there he would be inclined to want to stay
as long as possible, but there are others to
consider. War would work terrific hard-
ships on all and it is obviously better to
leave to their own resou -es the few who
would lose by leaving China than to have a
Will”.

War ill China is a grim reality, our citi—
zens there are in danger and will inevitably
be placed ill a position where we must either
protect them by war or leave them, unless

THE GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

they are removed to safety now.

The warnings have been given. Now it
is time for action. It is up to the governs
illellt to make it plain that we can not risk
war for the sake of a few individuals.

Economic Progress,

or Status Quo

Ill Los Allgeles, Calif, the owner of a
knitting mill shut down by a strike, is try-
ing to settle the problem by offering to turn
his plant over to the workers themselves. He
would have nothing to do with the manager
nlellt of the plant, and has offered to solve
the sales problem by buying all the output
himself.

Now, however, a difficulty arises. Tile
national labor relations board claims that
the employees would still be “scabs" if they
went back to work under this setup. We are
frank to admit that we agree with the owns
er, L. G. Griffith, when he says, “I can’ see
how they (the workers) can scab against
themselves. After they own the corporation
they can recognize any ullioll they want to.”

Barring the possibilities that there are
other complications involved, it seems that
Mr. Griffith has done his part. Certainly
his proposition leaves little to be desired by
the workers On the face of it the facts
seem to be that the labor relations board has,
through some technicality, succeeded ill stop-
ping any possibility of settlement.

‘ The question is simply whether employ-
er and employee are to be allowed to work
out their problems under supervision, or.
whether the government is going to regulate
rigidly the relations between them in such a
way as to make impossible any development
ill our economic setup. S

Klan Invades Court
(neprinied from the Christian Century)

Liberals have been reading, with no lit
tle embarrassment and bewilderment, the
currently published proofs that Hugo L.
Black, recent appointee of President Roose-
velt to the United States Supreme Court has
been, and presumably still is, a member of
the Ku Klux Klan.

Black joined the hooded order ill 1923.
Two years later, after he had secured the
backing of the Klan as its candidate for the
United States senate, he wrote a pro forma
resignationgpolitically useful ill case he had
occasion to deny that he was a Klansman.

A year after that, he and Governor
Bibb Graves received gold badges of life
membership alld Black expressed his gratis
tudc to the Klan for electing hilll. Alabama
was pretty well ill the grip of the Klan at
that time. '

Now the particular mess that this whole
episode reveals and illustrates is this: Black
is a social liberal and a supporter of all the
New Deal policies; his enemies, both ill his
own state alld ill the recent contest over the
confirmation of his appointment as a Su»
preme Court justice, may be described, at
least ill a general way, as economic reaction-
aries.

But the Klan is a thoroughly reaction—
ary organization. Its methods are the most
dangerous form of fascism that has yet ape
pcared ill America. Economic interests
probably had more to do with its growth
than racial or religious prejudice, and ill its
later recrudescence it has given lls mucll ate
telltion to fighting everything that conven-
tional hulldl'edrpercellters call communism
as to disciplining the Negroes and Catholics.

Alld now we have Klansman Black, the
president’s first choice to redeem the Su—
preme court from that economic conserva-
tism, superinduced by senility, which was
all obstacle to tlle New Deal’s social liberal-
ism. It doesn’t quite make sense.

“It’s the men who are the ‘softies' of higher
education. I base that on obsewation of university
and college board meetings over a period of many
years. When some important decision is to be
made, the men are more often swayed by emotion
than Women.” A "you’re an old ‘softy’” to male
college presidents and professors from Dr. Virginia

Thursday accomplished the almost
impossible feat of halting wars

hostilities lasted only ten minutes,
however, unlil the Japanese sols

descendant of the sun goddess.

A Danish scientist has discover

intent on taking it.

A group at them -s executives
this week startled young men
when they announced that as a
whole they preferred men over so

but labor relstions board clsims
it can't be done, When regula-

new economic ideas, they have de-
tented their own purpose.

Alcatraz prison, America’s prison
for incorrigible criminals, was
beaten by a prisoner yesterday as
he walked past a line of marching
