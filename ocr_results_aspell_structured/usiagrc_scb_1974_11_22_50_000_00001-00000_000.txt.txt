liberal arts colleges lately, Called the
President and Dean Shufﬂe. In the last
round, Grinnell College appeared to have
scored big, while sister college Middlebury in
Vermont is claiming a substantial 1055,

As Middleburyeducated Glenn Leggett
steps down as Grinnell President, Middiebury
Dean A. Richard Turner steps up. According

to Brad Gay, student body president at
Middlebury College, not only has Grinnell
gained a new president, but a “phenomenal"
art history lecturer as well,
Real rapport

Furthermore, said Gay, “Not only did he
(Turner) have respect, but he has real raps
port with students.” He continued, “You're
getting a great guy. and i don’t think you'll be
disappointed "

News of Turner's election here and subs
sequent resignation in Vermont was not
without repercussions, however, Gay said the
news was a “definite shock" to the college
community “Most Students were upset, but
happy ior him."

Another dean at Middlebury applied ior the
presidency at Grinnell. but was shuttled
aside. He will retain his position in Vermont,

While Grinnell is now even atone president

And tor the iirst time at Middlebury, two

Armstrong said he resigned, aiter it years

number of other colleges around the country
playing the shuttle, particularly in the ACM

Knox and Monmouth have all-received new
presidents.
