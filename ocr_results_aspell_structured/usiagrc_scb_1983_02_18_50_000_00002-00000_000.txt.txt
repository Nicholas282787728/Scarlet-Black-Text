Grad induction

A native Iowan officially joined
the highest ranks of American inven-
tors last Sunday when Robert N. Noyce
was inducted into the National Inven-
tors Hall of Fame. Born in Burlington
and a 1949 graduate of Grinnell College,
Noyce and four other scientists were
added to a select list of inventors that
includes Thomas Edison and Henry
Ford. The five were inducted at
ceremonies held in Arlington, Va.

Noyce was honored for his 1961 patent
on a semiconductor device that could
contain several transistors. He has
subsequently received numerous other
patents {or integrated circuit devices
and is considered the pioneer who open-
ed the way to the memory chip and
microcomputer industry.

Noyce was granted a National Medal
of Science by President Carter in 1980,
and he also holds the Ballantine Medal
of the Franklin Institute and the Medal
of Honor of the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers. A member
and past chairman of the Grinnell Col-
lege trustees, Noyce is a founder and
vice chairman of the board of Intel
Corp, one of the world’s largest
manufacturers of integrated ,elec-
tronicss stems, ' l ' ‘i l ‘ ‘

New law may force Pub to clgse

by Alan Abram.

A proposal to raise the drinking age in
Iowa from 19 to 21, which the Governor’s
Task Force on Drunken Driving is ex-
pected to put forth in order to reduce trai-
fic deaths, would mean the closure of the
Pub and Could also mean the end of alcohol
at all-campus parties.

Both students, faculty and members of
the administration are concerned about
the effects the proposal could have on stu-
dent lilestyle. Campus organizations are
preparing to oppose passage of the pros
posal.

The proposal comes in the wake of has
tionwide concern about teenage drunk
driving deaths. Last year 8,000 teenagers
died and 40,000 were maimed due to ac-
cldean involving alcohol. A Gallup poll
last year showed that 58 percent of the peo-
ple living in states with drinking ages of 19
or 20 want the limit raised. Recently
several states have taken that step.

Jim Tederman. dean of Student Affairs,
brought the proposal to the attention or
several student organizations. Now SGA,
the Campus Democrats and the Pub are
organizmg to light the measure,

Haines Hall president Pete Hautzinger
has drafted a letter which the Campus
Democrats and the Pub Board have signed
expressing opposition to raising the drink-
ing age. Hautzinger urges students to
write to their Iowa state senator and
representative about this issue.

The letter, which will be submitted to
SGA for approval, does not oppose the
limit to 21 altogether, but it does ask that
exceptions be made for college campuses.
Paul Cohen, Pub manager, agrees that
raising the limit may save lives, but he ad-
dded, “Very few people drive alter going
to me Pub, In the four years that I've been
at Grinnell there haven’t been any driving
problems coming out of the Pub.”

While a change in the law may save
lives, many people feel it will also have a
detrimental effect on campus life. Teder»

man, who opposes the proposed change in
the law, is afraid that members of the ad
ministration will be forced into playing the
role of policemen. This new role could
cause heightened tension between the
students and the administration, Students
with alcohol problems might be less inclinv
ed to seek help from their resident ads
Visors.

Some feel that the Pub provides students
with a needed social release from
academic pressure. Others astutely

observe that Grinnell parties revolve’

around beer; when the keg runs out, so do
the people.

Some students feel otherwise, however,
One student said that there was too much
drinking at Crinnell already. Added
another, “The face of Grinnell is changing.
I think that alcohol as a social element is
going out already "

Still, most students oppose a change in
the law. Said one student “I filled out a
draft notice a year ago. If I'm old enough
to do that, I’m old enough to drink.”

Even some people in government oppose
raising the legal limit. Sven Steiner, the
Director of the Governor’s Highway Safety
Office, feels that lowering the limit will not
reduce traffic deaths, He points out that
raising the limit from 18 to 19 in 1978 did
not decrease traftic fatalities, and that, in
fact, such deaths rose in 1979.

Steiner feels that other measures, such
as banning beer sales in convenience
stores after 10 pm, could be more cited»
tive in combating highway deaths,

Paul Cohen agreu and suggests that
education about the dangers of alcohol and
drunk driving would also be highly effec-
tive, He points out that teenagers will still
be able to obtain alcohol even if they can't
drink it in a bar. Said Cohen, ”I think
they've already made a great step towards
stopping drunk driving by toughening the
drunk driving laws. Making people aware
of these laws is very important."

fortly among kegs of beer. A proposal
to raise the drinking age in Iowa to 21

Cohen and SGA are going to attempt to
coordinate with other schools and taverns
to lobby against the law. SGA plans to con
tact other student government assoclaa
Lions, and the Pub plans to contact tavern
owners in lowa City, who are dependenton
student business for survivial.

Surprisingly, the manager of the
Longhorn is not concerned about the pros
posal. He says that although he would cera
tainly oppose raising the limit, the lowa
Restaurant Association does not think that
any such bill is close to being passed by the
State Legislature.

However, the administration is preparr
ing for the worst, and Student Affairs is
now writing to other colleges who have ex-
perienced a change in the drinking age to
find out how they handled the situation.

Trustees approve tuition hike, assail aid law
College planning and physical improvements raised at Tuscan meeting

by Dan Ninrenbaum

President Drake’s presentation of the
’32-'34 budget at the lri-annual trustees’
meeting in Tuscon, Ariz., last weekend
resulted in the approval of another tuition
hike and a rebuff to the new Selective Ser-
vice law, in addition to support for several
campus renovation and construction pro-
jects.

Parents and students will face a six per-
cent increase in the tuition and fees for
next year. pushing the price of a Grinnell
education up from the current $8700 to
$5240.

This rise represents another stage in the
administration‘s long range plan to
counterbalance the inflationary pressure
which raises college costs, Grinnell now
ranks in the top 20 percent among ACM
schools in tuition costs.

Since the endowment has been boosted
by new stock investments, the college has
decreased the actual amount that students
pay for the total cost per year at Grinnell,
A student with no aid will pay 61 percent of

ﬁle total cost next yar, a drop of three
percentage points from last year.

The amount of financial aid is increas-
ing, asserted Drake, as students' need in-
creases due to the economy. “We're going
to try and compensate as much as possible
and students on aid should not suffer from
this (increase)," he stated.

Closely related to the financial aid area,
the trustees produced a resolution stating
their objections to the upcoming law which
ties financial aid approval to draft
registration. The law requires all male
students renewing or initiating financial
aid requests to sign an affadavit identify-
ing themselves as registrants or
nonregistrants. The college is then
obligated to report the latter group to the
federal government,

Released last week, the trustees resolu-
tion claims that the law “penalizes the less

affluent nanregistranls whilednequitably _

encluding more affluent 'non'registrants

ii e 2"Sc-ai‘rl'e'r and‘iala'c'k' reunion 18‘. '1st '

from the consequences of culpability."
Further, the trustees complained that the
law appears “to find a citizen guilty and to
impose a penalty without due process of
law."

“We wanted to register our general op-
position to one law,” explained Drake.
“We will obey the law, but we will also try
to change the law, using legal and political
pressure,” he added, noting consultations
with lawyers and under ACM and Iowa in-
stitutions.

On a less controversial note, the trustees
added the evaluations of the campus plan~
nor to the agenda of the May meeting.
Richard Dober, who developed the dorm
renovation program, included in his report
“virtually everything on campus except
the dorms and Burling,” said Drake. Some

'of the major conclusions will suggest

Mears Hall as the new Admissions Office
location, the Forum as more of a “student
center” and a plan for the recently cleared
Cooper School property. As President
Drake clarified, “It’s a question of
resources and the needs of the college.”

In a similar vein, the trustees discussed
Drake’s paper concerning the. future of
Grinnell over the next decade (5&3,
11-12-82, p. a). This paper recommended
improved quantitative, critical reasoning
and communication skills, a faculty of
”teaching scholars,” an improved library
collection and a continued national
recruitment effort.

The trustees responded with “general
approval" of the document as a guide in
the long range planning process. Drake
summarized his evaluation, stating that
“What we've been doing (at Grinnell) is
pretty good, and we should continue trying
to do a little better.”

The trustees also discussed some short-
range plans, notably the Venture Fund,
which was created two years ago by the
sale of the college—owned TV station in

Ohio. (stain, 12-10-82, p'. 1). Hour year 32 '

million computer development process
will proceed as planned, complementing
the Sloan award. This money is targeted
for computer hardware purchases, such as
new terminals for classrooms and pro-
fessor's Offices and a new central process-
ing unit, as well as some graphics soft-
ware.

The Venture Fund will also subsidize the
U.S,S.R. travel plans for a group of Grin-
nell students and a professor. This excur~
sion will conclude an eight credit Russian
course offered next semester and will oc-
cur over ﬁle Christmas break.

The renovation and construction plans
approved by the trustees include a new
observatory, an improved Fine Arts base-
ment level and a refurbished Grinnell
House.

The Grant 0, Gale Observatory will be
built this summer on the north end of the
baseball diamond, so named to honor Pro
iessor Emeritus of Physics and Physics
Historical Museum Curator Gale, who
began teaching at Grinnell in i929. The
observatory will serve as a welcome ex-
pansion to the old facilities for both the
students and townspeople. A foundation in
Philadelphia contributed $150,000 toward
the $350,000 project; the remainder will be
covered by alumni donations.

As directed by the fire marshal, the
basement of Fine Arts will be completely
redesigned to meet safety codes, including
a new mechanical system to improve the
air flow, new exits, more classrooms. and
masonry to replace the wooden infrastruc
ture.

Finally, Grinnell House will be refur~
bished in order to increase the accom-
modations on campus for summer pro
gram participants. Although decor will not
be changed, the mechanical systems will
be replaced, air conditioning will be in
stalled and kitchen facilities will be im-
proved. The $300,000 project is planned for
completion next fall. ’
