b it becomes more evident
that the program for com-
mencement week will be more
elaborate this year than usultl, the
appreciation of the responsibility
which rests upon the students
should grow apace. There are
certainpartsotthecommencement
exercises which depend wholly
upon the students. and the success
or tailure of these parts will de-
pend upon whether or not suEﬁci-
ent interest is aroused to insure the
right kind of preparation. The
two things we have in mind are
the contest in oratory for the
Hyde prizes, and the contest in
extemporaneous address tor the
Hill prizes. Both ot these con-
tests are important features of
commencement week and are
worthy of the best efforts of those
who are planning to enter them.
Lastyearthere was somedlfﬁculty
about the preliminary for the
Hyde prize contest, on account of
a misunderstanding as to the con»
dttions under which the contest
is held, but these conditions were
published some weeks ago. sothat
for the present year abundant
time has been given for getting
out the best talent of the different
classes. with excellent training
which Miss Smith will give the
speakers, there is no reason why
the contest ot this year, should
not be the best that has ever been
held. it may seem strange to
urge students to make preparation
for the contest in extemporaneous
speaking. but the strangeness dise
appears when the objects of the
Hill prize are understood, As
the founders of the prize stated
last spring. it is designed to err
courage extemporaneous speak-
ing throughout the whole year,
in order to make a good showing
in the commencement contest,
the speakers must have some
good experience during the intern
vening months. It is well under.
stood that the qnestions to be dis
cussed will very likely be ques
tions relating to social. political
and industrial problems. so that
a familiarity with the discussions
of such questions in the maga-

PRESIDENT BRADLEY’S VISIT
DELAYEDl

It was expected that Dr. Brad-
ley would be in Grinnell for a few
days during the middle of this
week, but information has been re-
ceived to the effect that he cannot
come before March Ist. Business
complications and the many du-
ties iollowing upon his decision to
come to Grinnell have ﬁlled his
time so completely that he was
forced to postpone his visitjlo a
later date. It is not known deﬁ-
nitely when he will be here but it
will be about March rst.
