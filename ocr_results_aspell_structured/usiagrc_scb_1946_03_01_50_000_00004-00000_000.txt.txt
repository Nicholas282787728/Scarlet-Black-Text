Cowles and Gales
Deiea’r Opponents
In Cage Ma’rches

In thc past week of intramural
basketball games, Cowles and
Gates emerged as victors.

Cowles, displaying a fast mov-
ing and sharp shooting team,
,downed Clark to the tune of a
34-21 score. In the early part
of the game Clark threatened to
overpower the Cowles fivc, but
Cowles, putting on a last-half
scoring drive out~distanced the
fighting boys from Clark.

In a score that would sug-
gest baseball rather than the
usual high-scoring basketball,
the men from Gates defeated
(Dibble in a low-scoring game,
139. The game was knotted
until the last few minutes of
play when Gates sank two has
licts to out-point the Dibble
men.

"Church's Mission"
Begins Seminar's
Sessions Tonigh’r

Individual sessions of the In-
ternational Student Seminar will
open on campus tonight at 3:30
p. m. in Main hall drawing
room with Dr. Ruth Isabel Sea-
hury presiding.

"The World Mission of the
Church” will be the general top-
ic m be discussed by Dr. Sea—
bury; Martin Rodriguez, Hon—
duras; Mlle. Elizabeth Perdrizet,
France; and the Rev. Samuel
Devapragasm, India; and forty
Grinnell students.

Brought to the campus by the
American Board of (language
tional Christian churches, the
International Seminar' is con-
ducting meetings with a senior
group in the Congregational
church. This seminar group of
state of Iowa churches opened
yesterday.

“Well, yes. I went to Oberlin
college and white a student there
participated in most of the
sports."

“What would yoi| say was your
best field7"

“Oh, I guess football and
ibaseball. Of course. that was
a good many years ago and since
then I've gotten out of condition,
as you can see." '

“Yes,” I gasped. “You are
certaiidy out of condition. When
we made that last lap your
bottom lip ilirlll't oven dip sand
as mine did.” With that, I
fell flat on my face and pass-
ed completely out.

Now, sitting in bed nursing
various and Mondry charley-
horses, since I have scooped the
,rcst of the staff on this maz-
ing story I feel it my pri lcge
to request that I be transferred
from the sports department to
assistant garden edit ~ or to
the society page. Writing sports
is too much for n person of my
weak constitution if this re-
quest is approve, I suggcsti
that you appoint Mr. Joseph W.-
Charltoii, Assistant Professor of
Economics, as sports editor. He
can take it. ‘

Sportingly,
John “Putfrpuff” Barbour

Ed. note: Although we regret
this fatal loss to our sports de—
partment, we feel that Mr. Barr
bour has gained promotion to
any post he desires through this
terrific risk to life and health
that he took for the sake of nhe‘
dear old Sim. Therefore, we‘
give him the highest post now
available on our staff — that of
iiadies' editor of our spring seed
‘Catelogue. We would like to
[append to this one sniali reel
quest 7 although he is too far
gone to continue sports writing,‘
he might give us just a few li
tle items every week on basket-
ball, track, golf, tennis, swimr‘
ming, and spring football. That
isn't much to ask, is it, Pufﬁn
Puff? In the meantime, we will'
begin negotiations with Uncle
Joe. Fondly, e
