Used book buyback

ln' Cameos Lu ANDJACOH RblSiscitG

Every semester, Grinnell College students swipe their petards and open
their wallets at the campus bookstore to spend hundreds ofdollars on a se-
mester’s \voith of textbooks, both used and new, In the coming weeks, stur
dents will be faced with the option otexchanging their dusty piles of books
for cold, hard cash.

Grinnell College usually has the Nebraska Book Company buy books from
students at the end oreach semester. paying the student typically 25 percent of
thc original pricc. The Nebraska Book Company then sells these books back
to the bookstore for 50 percent ofthe original price. and the bookstore then
sells it used typically fot 75 percent ofthe original price

This semester, Grinnell College spent $118,000 for the used books that it
sold to students, and lrlade a proﬁt ofroughly $13,000 offofthose used books,
according to bookstore manager Cassie Wherry

Occasionally, when the bookstore knows that they need a certain book
for a future class, it has a representative buy those books back from students,
according to assistant bookstore manager Harley Mellrath, ”In that case, the
student is paid for his or her book the amount that we would have paid the
wholesaler for the book,"Mcllrath wrote in an e-mail to the 8&3.

students also and alternatives to buying new and used books, such as buy
ing them online, or utilizing the Lending Library or Interlibrary Loan process.

Brita Higgins '11 uses the Lending Library to lessen the full cost ofteitt-
books. “I really like the Lending Library because if it weren't for them, it
would probably [cost] $300 a semester, it really saves my butt,” Higgins said.

Cammy Roberts '10, who buys her textbooks onllne, uses the Nebraska
Book Company at the end ofthe semester.

“I thinkwhy people go sell it to the third party is because they'll buy books
that certain people won’t need, because rherc are certain classes that don’t re-
use books," Roberts said. “So if there's a separate corporation that's like ‘Yeah,
I'll take your books,’ it's nice to get 85 back "

However, not every school has an unaffiliated buyer come in to purchase
books at the end of the semester. Macalester College’s bookstore actually buys
the hooks back directly from students for 50 percent or the original price,
whether used or new

“The methodology is that it [Macalesrer] needs it, we pay 50 percent of
the new or used price, and then theoretically we turn around and sell it for
75 percent oftl’le new price," said Macalester bookstore manager Carey Start.

Some students would agree that Grinnell’s bookstore should follow a simi-
lar system to that otMaealesrcr's bookstore. “I want to support Grinnell and
cut the third man out entirely. The more moneyl can funnel into this system,
the more money I can get out ofit,”said Greg Rossi ’10,who also said that he
usually cannot sell his books back at the end of the semester because “they're
pretty obscure books.”

According to Mcllratli,the bookstore cannot buy back used books because
there is no certainty that the books have the potential for resale.

“The reason that we do not buy our own books back because we don't have
any guarantee that we'll ever use those books again,"Mellrath said. Mellrath
also cited that constant new editions to books make it difﬁcult to keep books,
even used ones, for along period oftime.

Whenever used books are sold, the author and publishing company make
no money Thus, the publisher is only free from the competition of the used
book market during the ﬁrst semester that an edition is out. After that, the
used book market begins to absorb proﬁts, which attributes to the high ptice
oftextbooks, lfthe publisher profits only during the ﬁrst time the book is sold,
they must price the book higher since the profits from subsequent sales will
never come back to them.

Henry Roediger, a psychologist and textbook author, wrote an article in
the Jan. 2005 issue of Academic Observer entitled “Why Are Textbooks So
Expensive?” in which he wrote that used book sellers are, “true parasites, de-
riving protits with no investment (and no value added to the product) while
damaging their hosts."

Students are the ones to pay the brunt of the cost, as they run into high
prices when buying, and low prices when selling.

“When used books still cost a lot, that’s frustrating," Higgins said. “lfwe’re
only to get 25 percent ofthe originel cost, it would be nice it they didn’t sell
it for such a high profit."

Pride

from p. .1. Central Iowa.

The last, and perhaps most interesting, addition to
Pride Week is an allecampus tlipecup tournament sponsored by stoneCo
and the Grinnell College football team,

“Jon Richardson [10] came up with [the idea]," Ktandel said They
thought it would be such a great collaboration as a way to demonstrate
how supportive our community is.

Registration, which has occurred all this week, consists ofa team of
three and a ten dollar entry fee. Each team ofthtee will be paired with
two other teams ofthrce in an effort to get often socially separated cam—
pus factions to intermingle in a queerrfiiendly environment

Pride week concludes with the Pride Parade this Sunday, April 19,
beginning at 11 am. in the East Campus parking lot. Many campus
groups organ e cars, but any and all students at large are encouraged
to participate lm going to be in the erc [Feminist Action Coalition]
carr Last year we like wrote ‘FAC has pi-ide'or something on the cal, but
we have a lot ofstrcamers and make posters and painted our rates," Friel
said. “The Pride Parade was kind «safer-notional last year and I think it's a
really good way to go out with a bang,"

From Monday, April 20 to Friday, April 24, in eon-
nection with Earth Week, Free the Planet! and Donn
Environmentel Coordinators (DECs) are presenting
Eeolympics, a series ofcvents and competitions intended
to promote “green" attitudes and behaviors on campus

The Ecolympics are a competition between R
deuce Halls across campus centered around minimizing
enugy usage and waste ptoducu'oni Students can earn
points for their Residence Hall by participatingin evenrsv
such as environmental study breaks and trivia games. At
the end ofthe week, the winning Residence Hall receives
funds for a celebration.

“It's kind oraweyte competitively misc environmen-
tal avlmreness,"said FTP member Curtis McCoy'lO.

Ein'ironmenul and Safety Coordinator Chris Bait
said he ﬁrst bmught up the idea after leaniing ofa simi-
lar competition at Duke University

"I hear about Dukes [event] at a wnfetencc and
thought it would be a great idea, Bait said.

Extending from this original idea. Grinnell’s Eco
lymph: event seeks to involve the entire campus in eulri»
vating a more environmentally-oriented mindset.

“The main goal ofthc event is to get the entire amt
pus involved in raising environmental awareness. The
densities are meant to be fun, bni them is also an educa—
tional cotnponcnt,”McCoy sud.

Members of FTP said they hoped that the Boo-
lynipics would help misc awareness regardingindividual

residence halls'enetgy usage. As a response to Grim
nell’s decision not to measure energy usage by hell but
instead as an entire campus, FTP member Il/licah Bot-
Miller 11 said he hopes the competition will help to
better identify the distribution of energy among resi-
dence halls.

“[Eoolympics] came about as a response to the idea
that the dorms are not submetered, and so we can’t tell
the individual electricity usage fore-och, " Bot-Miller
said.

According to Bot Miller, a surveyand gamewirh
environmentally— related questions on PioneerWeb
will help educate and gauge knowledge among stu»
dean,

Bot-Miller added that the competition will result
in more than just increased environmental conscious-
ness. '

“So our goal is to encourage energy anarcness, and
hopenilly in the future we'll have the technology so
that we can actually have more authentic competitions
based on energy [usage], Bo-t Miller said

The six Dccs m representatives distributed
through clilsteis, will also inform students about en-
ergy usage with kilowatt meters.

“DEC: on each campus have got kilowatt meters
that can tell you what various things rake up energy,
and how much thev use," said Younker DEC Leah
Irnlay 10.
