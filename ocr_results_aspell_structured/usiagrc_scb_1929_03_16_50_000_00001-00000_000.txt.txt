DESCRIBES EXPERIMNTS

Dr. Rand. Outlines Relationship of
External Elements to the
Embryonic Growth.

Dr. H. w. Rand, Harvard mcliungc
protessor, spoke on “The mternal
Elements oi Development" at long
chapel Thursday morning. He sump
marized the experiments that have
been carried on concerning the relar
tiou oi gravity, water, heat electric
ity and chemicals to the development
of embryos.

“The fornlcdeterlllining tactor-s are
obviously inside the protoplasm," ivas
Dr. Rand’s conclusion. ' xternal tac-
tors provide materials necessary fur
development. and act as a stimulus
to the embryo; they may cause 107
cal arrests and abnormalitie; but
they do not determine toi-m."

Dr. Rand sketched the results or
various experiments with the extern-
al environments or embryos and eggs.
The relation or chemicals to develop~
ing embryos is especially striking.
One investigator placed fish eggs in
water that bad no magnesium in it.
Some oi the fishes had only a single
eye in the middle oi the head, while
others had iused eyes, or eyes too
close together. This was found to be
only a negative abnormality, since
the cause was that the brain between
the eyes could not develop without
magnesium, and the eyes were so
close together that' they fused.

Describes Experiment.

Herbst raised sea urchins irom
eggs, and tnund that the presence or
sodium, potassium, calcium. and mug~
nesinm in the water is essential to
development. In water tree or cal-
cium, the cells at the embryo tall
apart and iloat around separately.

Electricity and magnetism, radium
and x-rays in the environment give
negative results. x-rays may prove
valuable in research for damaging or
killing particular chromosomes, leav-
ing other chosen chromosomes to be
observed.

Mechanical agencies of contact and
pressure have no important ettect on
embryos. They are always protected
against mechanical agencies in na-
ture by being immersed in liquid,
either in water, or in the fluid or the
egg 01' uterus.

Light M'l'ncts Growth.

Gravity and light may determine
the direction or growth in plants and
plant-like animals, biit they have no
qualitative eitect. Light may retard
or accelerate the rate or development,
and the color or light may have some
ettect. Green light is uniavorable to
some animals.

Water is important for develop-
ment, since protoplasm is 50-96%
water. Jelly-fish and young tadpoles
are 95% water. But water does not
determine iorm. Change in osmotic
pressure may retard or accelerate deg
velopment, hilt it also is not (orni—
determining.

Heat, like other external tactors, is
only quantitative in eiiect. A (empel'r
ature below 35 or above 39 degrees
will cause abnormality in the develr
opment of a chick by causing local
arrests of development, but it will
not make any new or unique tor-ms.

club presented a program tilled with
the lite and color or a new season ior
its twenty-third annual concert last
night. Harmony and the zest sug-
