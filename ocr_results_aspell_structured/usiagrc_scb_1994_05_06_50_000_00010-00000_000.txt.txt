taken that height as an active statement
regarding Mr. Nixon. The day would
have pxsed without mention and we, as
a trivalc institution, could have easily
avoided making any sort of public, coir
loctive statement instead, the adminis-
tration chose w makea very public, very
political statement by lowering the ﬂag.
And I, as an employee of this institution,
was forced into complicity with that
statement. As I understand it the starc-
ment made by that lowered ﬂag was, at
the very last that the Grinncll commu-

an otherwise admirable career. I cannot
allow that statement to be made on my
behalf. As one who is employed at

I live with the results of Nixon’s
crimes against democracy every day in
my classrooms. Every day I face sure
dents who believe that all presidents lie
and cheat. that the systcm is and always
has been corrupt, that all politicians are
slime, Without negating the role of

construction of history because it is un~

very different from other presidents and
must be treated differently — lest we

I am a memba of the generation

of Vietnamese) die while ho dithered

To the Editor, ,,
At the very beginning of this
year, there was a rash of crime
throughoutcampusl Paoplcwcrt;
nervous aboutlcaving backpacks
unattended in Burling, and ev!
cryonemadc surclheirbikcs wert
locked up at all times. People
were concerned, but everyone
shrugged it off as just a symptorri
of a new year. And lhings evcnr
tually calmed down ,
So what‘s going on now?
Bikes are being stolen, and ma
Bike Club sends out a warning tr}
its members. A few friends oi
mine had a party and endcd up
having the tap for the keg, a grill?
and govern] rings hidden in the
balhroom,slolcnl Several t-shirts
were stolen at Titular Head last
weekend, shirts I paid for and
now have no way of making back
the money. Just a symptom oi
the end-of-thcrycar craziness? I
hope not. ‘
This kind of crap doesn‘t
necd to happen here. It’s hard
enough staying sane with such a
small school. Add to that tho‘
elements of suspicion and dis~
trust, and this place will becomt:
a living hell. Think about it, and
if anybody wants to return any:
thing they've “borrowed," I'm
sure lhere are plenty of poop];
who‘d like to see their belong-
ings returned. ‘
