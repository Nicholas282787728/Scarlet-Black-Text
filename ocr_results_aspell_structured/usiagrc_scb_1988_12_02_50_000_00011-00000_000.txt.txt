The Grinnell‘s men's
wimming team got their season
nderway with a splash in the
eet against Washington
niversity and in the Pioneer

clays.
On Friday, Nov. 18, Wash.
. came to visit. This was their
venth meet and the first for the
'oncers. Despite this disadvan-
ge, Grinnell was undauntcd.
nd when the waves had calmed
rinnell had defeated the Bears

The relay team of Kevin
oersehug, Tom Nelson, Mark
nderson, and Scott Potts took
rst in tlle men: 200 medley re-
y with a time of 1:41.41, beat-
g the nearest Wash. U. com-
‘tilors by over 4 seconds. In

There were many bright
nts for the Pioneers during the
o meets. On Friday. the 200
edley relay team of Deb Koa,
sic Petheram, Katy Furnish
d Shannon Swanerom clocked
at 2:00.74, just two seconds
f the school record. Furnish
lso qualified for the national
eet in the 50 free with a time of
t .77 seconds. Coach Cain also
ited strong weekend perfor-
ances from freshmen Mercedes
lanforth, Heather Lange and
heila Tom, and personal bests
rom several members of the
am. On the downside, the team
as dealt a loss this week when
- nior diver Colleen Murphy left
e team. Murphy was a national

Ialifler from a year ago.

This weekend the Grinnell
men travel to Coe for a tri-
eet that also includes Luther.
oach Cain feels that they should

able to win the meet if they
rim as well as they can.

Pioneer Relays is a twenty year
old meet, and only relays (hence
the name) are swum. In diving,
the resulLs are scored by the team
and Bishop and Rob Aulwes
combined for a first place finish
in the one meter and second place
in the three meter.

The 400 medley relay team
of Clem, Zimscn. Anderson, and
Williams set a new lneet record
of 3:46.77. Zilnsen teamed up
with Nelson and Ressner to set
the new 600 IM meet record of
6:16:51. Zimsen, Nelson and
Smith swam the 300 breast relay
with a lncct record time of
3:14.60. And one final meet
record (hey, stop groaning. if it
was your record you'd want it
mentioned) was set by Anderson,
Patrick. and Ressner in the 300
butterﬂy relay with a time of
2:47.32.

Coach Obermiller was
pleased with what he termed, “a
real team effort". He couldn't
single any one swimmer out be-
cause he felt all had performed
wonderfully. Even John
Williams was momentarily
speechless at the success of the
meet before saying he thought
that "everyone had personally
performed very well.“ Obem'tiller
hopes this is indicative of the

upcoming season and hopes his .

team will perform well against
some tough squads.

Cross country runners
seconds off pace for
All—American honors

The Grinnell cross country
program sent two runners to the
NCAA national meet in St.
Loui just a few weeks back.
Freshman Christine Thorburn and
senior Greg Evans were the sole
Pioneer representatives at this
prestigious event.

Thorburn placed 44th out
of a field of over 100. The
freshman sensation was only 27
seconds off the pace of achieving
Alermerican status. Coach

Evelyn Freeman was particularly
pleased with her star runner. who
had fought offa bout with the on
to make nationals.

Evans finished 35th, a mere
10 seconds shy of All-American
honors. Coach Will Freeman
said, "I'm happy with the way
Greg's season tumed out. He is a
very busy student and his accom-
plishments in cross country were
outstanding . . . . Evans is the
finest cross counLry runner we‘ve
ever had here."

 

 

Men's basketball

lockerroom smokln', busting out
to a 56-37 lead. A Spurbeck
three-point play coupled with a
Mchmsey lsrfooter brought
Grinnell within three at 53-50,
but that was as close as it would
get. A wellrcoached Simpson
team shot the lights out, and was
relentless on the boards, tipping
in any second or third shot
opportunities. All the Pioneers
could do was sit back and watch;
it was Simpson's night tonight.
Despite suffering defeat,
Westlund was proud of his team‘s
efforts, especially against a team
of as high a caliber as Simpson.
"Simpson (470) is a very, very
good basketball team. They are
projected to finish in the top two
in the Iowa conference. I‘m glad
that our fellas weer able to stick

with them the way they did. . ..

Our guys played exceptionally
well. They played intelligent,
hardrnosed defense. denying
Simpson the ball down low on a
number of occasions. it was an
allraround team effort."

The coach's words are right
on the money. The Pioneers
hustled with every play, and
played within themselves, which
is an often overlooked key to
success on the court. They exe-
cuted well, getting their shots off
as planned; unfortunatlcy, their
jumpers bounced in and out. But
that’s bound to change.

Tomorrow evening at 7:30
Grinnell will host a strong Wart-
burg club, a team which gave the
Pioneers a beating just one year
ago. But hey, this isn't the same
team as last season, by any
suetch of the imagination.
