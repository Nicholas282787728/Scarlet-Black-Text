highly coirrpliirrenrcd on the splendid
ionit‘i'l. given IRSL evening.

The program \\ as especially well not
once and ontaiued not only such beau-
tiful cl. sics as Dvorak's “Songs My
Mother Taught Me” and Beach's “The
Years AS the Spring," but light and
catchy songs such as “The Old Lady ot
Franco,“ and the “Johnny Schnioher"
iii German.

Tire llork or the Chili was supple
niepted by several numbers by the
quartet, beautifully given. They gave
as an encore the lovely “Sleep Little
Baby of Mine."

The cello numbers by Miss Par-hin-
soii, and . iss MacDonald-s piano num-
bers w -e greatly enjoyed by every one
while the solos of Miss Snyder, cone
ti-alto, were excellent.

The last number on the program,
"Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star," was a
surprise and a very pretty one. Eight
girls with not-(ls of tiny nlancholored
light/bulbs gave a charming drill in
which the Sparkling lights in the dark»

hitting stars or ﬁreﬂies. The climax
came when the cords were held back
and as the background appears a hugs

the Git-e Club song "0 nail to the Scar-

woiidertully pretty and the enthllsi»
