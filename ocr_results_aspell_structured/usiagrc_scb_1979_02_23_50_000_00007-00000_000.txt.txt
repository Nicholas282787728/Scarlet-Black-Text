New Michelob tight

by Paul Schwartz

In an effortto find a replacement
for retiring head football coach
Edd Bowers, a search committee,
appointed by Dean of the College
Waldo Walker, has been meeting
several times a week for most of
this month,

The committee representing a
varied group of Grinnell's faculty,
consists of John Pfchh, James
Tederman, Cindy winkler, Ben-
jamin Graham, Clifford Reid, and
Charles Jepsen. The selection of a
new coach is generally done by the
athletic department itself. Pfitsch
said. adding “It's a good
mechanism to have other faculty
members participate so that other
people come to know what the
problems are.”

THE COMMITTEE received 55
applications by the Feb. 1 deadline
and has since narrowed the field to
11 possible replacements. The
minimum qual' 'cations for a
candidate were: a master’s
degree. and coaching and
teaching experience at a high
school or college level.

Underlying these requirements,
Tederman said, is that the an
plicant be “sensitive to this type of
school and the differences in
coaching at a small liberal arts
college, We're not a gung—ho
football factory and want someone
with a broader area of skill."

TEDERMAN ALSO noted that
the candidate would probably
assume ths position of assistant
coach for two other sports and
should be qualified to teach
lifetime sports as well as physical
education theory classes.

The responses received alter the
announcement of the vacancy were
national. including applications
from both coasts, the midwest, and
one from Hawaii. Piitsch said the
committee did not actively seek
anyone and that the position was
open to any qualified applicants.
He said John Martinek, an
Associate Professor of Biology at
Grinnell, and Robert Pankey, the
men's indoor and outdoor track
coach and assistant football coach,
were among the initial applicants
for the job. but would not comment
on whether or not they were among

four poss‘ ties in the next week.
This final group will be invited to
Grinnell. They will be interviewed
by the Executive Council, the
faculty members of the athletic
department, and a committee of
students chosen from the athletic
teams, in addition to the Search
Committee.

No one person Will make the final
decision on who the new head
football coach will be, but Pfitsch
has the biggest say in the matter
since he serves as Grinnell’s
Director of Athletics in addition
to being on the Search Committee,

ONCE THE COMMITTEE puts
forward a single recommendation
to be approved by Dean Walker,
the favored applicant will be of-
fered two to five year contract.
Pfitsch says that this point in the
committee‘s Search should be
reached in the next two weeks, and
that the new head football coach
will be chosen prior to spring
break.

“The criteria for renewal of the
contract will not be a winning
season," Tederman said, stressing
that the committee's aim is to find
someone who will adapt easily to
the Grinnell sports philosophy.

by how close the meet was,

“We didn't expect it to be that
