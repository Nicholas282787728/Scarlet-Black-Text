Her freshman year oreollege, Paula Forbes ’05 made deep
fried rocks with oil oozing out ofthe top. She was aiming for
brownies, but made it rookie cooking mistake.

“My roommate at the time was a vegan, and I had con—
vinced myself that I had read somehwere, thatyou could sub-
stitute oil for eggs it was pretty disgusting hilt everyone
still ate them." '

Forbes' interest in cooking led her to create a recipe book
of 28 recipes that she created, were handed down through her
family or ones that she tweaked to make her own.

While the book, titled RM! Fund: A Grimm/1 Culinary
Survival Guide, docslft include the deep-fried rock brown-
ies, it does include the recipe she cooks the most often—her
mother's date chicken, the name ofwhich has nothing to do
with the ingredients.

“My mom made it for her dates in eollege because it’s
cheap and makes the house smell really good," she said. “lr’s
chicken with onions and butter white wine sauce.”

The idea for a recipe book came to Forbes when she had
a long winter break
before going abroad to
Germany. Her friends
often requested her
recipes in wilting, so
she deddcd to put to-
gcthcr a tccipc book as
a graduation gift

She contacted
Press, a student orga-
nization thet publishes
students‘ work, and
they were interested in
the idea. The ﬁnished
book,hand—bound by Forbes and the students who run Press,
is slated for release this Friday.

Forbes had always been interested in cooking, but began
to cook often for herself and her friends when she came to
