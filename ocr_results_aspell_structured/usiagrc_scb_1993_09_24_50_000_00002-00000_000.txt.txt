SKYDIVING from page 1
official club of the college any

WhileHanna understands the
college’s reason for banning the
club, he also believes that other
activities on campus are equally
dangerous, and should, in fair-
ness, also be banned.

“Some things that go on on
this campus are worse than sky
diving in my opinion," he said,

In fact, Hanna contends that
skydiving is quite safe.

"We onlyjump under the cor»
rect conditions," he said. ”What
can seem like a beautiful day to
some can be a really bad day for
skydivers if winds are too high.
And there are failnsafe measures
when you dive. Every person has
two parachutes. Beginners start
out with a really big square para-
chute that acts like a wing and
slows down the falli"

In addition, every student
must undergo a five»hour trainr

ing session prior tojumping.

“You learn ways to land and
what to do in case of an emer-
gency,” Hanna said. “We
watched a video and practiced
positions."

“The 92 Grinnellians who
have been skydivrng have mostly
enjoyed it," said Hanna. “i re
member one stutlentsaid thatshe
thought skydiving should be a
requirement for graduation and I
got lots of cool messages from
people after they jumped

“Skydiving is something you
pretty much know that you want
to do or not. There are a variety
ofreasons people doit—for fun,
for therapy, to prove to theme
Selves that they can do it."

Brad Melton claims to be a
skydiving addict.

“I always wanted to skydive
for as long as I can remember,"
he said. “And then last Spring I
knew [just had to do it. My first
jump was quite a rush Icouldn‘t

concentrate on anything for
days."

Both Hanna and Melton have
worked theirway up from straight
jumps to the more complicated
ireefalls.

“Whenidid my firstfreefall,
I was really screwed up 71 liter
ally couldn’t wipe the grin off
my face," said Melton. “Even
the next morning, I wasjumping
and bouncing around in my room,
When I did my second freefall, lt
calmed me down. It was like
something I needed."

Hanna wants to try RW Work
next, which he describes as “falln
ing as a group"

“You can make circles, join
hands, and do other things," he
said, “It’s pretty cool.”

Hannaand Melton won’lstop
skydiving, they say, at least in
the near future.

“I’ll never stop skydiving,"
said Melton. “It’s a drug, and
I’m hooked"
