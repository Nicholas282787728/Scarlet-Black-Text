VICE'PRESIDENTIAL INTERVIEWS

Brentnall urges study to address
curriculum, class overcrowding

What do you feel makes you the
best candidate for SGA Vice Presi-
dent?

I feel I‘m the best qualiﬁed candi-
date for the position of Vice Presi»
dent, President of Academic Affairs
because of my past experience with
groups at Grinnell. My position on
the Political Science SEPC has been
a learning process for me about how
individual. departmental SEPC'S
work. And I think this will be invalu-
able lo my job as President of Aca-
demic Affairs I think my work as a
I-IAC this year in Smith Hall and my
metnbershipon themen‘stennis team,
(although they are notrelated directly
to student government). the job that
I’ve done in these positions I believe
shows that I have a dedication to
fulfilling my roles. A HAC is a tough
position if you makeit tough,andI’ve
tried to go out of my way to ensure
that I've provided a variety of activi—
ties for my dorm so dial everyone is
pleased, and that’s the ultimate goal
of every job _. to make sure that
everyone is pleased

What do you foresee as the most
important issues facing SGA?

SGA is the mosteffective way for
students to directly inﬂuence what
ourcollegeadrninisn-ationdoes.There
are other ways through individual
petitioning and things, but there is no
other way in which you can collec-
tively have a voice of the students
brought to the administration, and
SGA has to ensure that this voice is
brought to the administration loud
and clear. Relating this to the position
of Vice President, I believe the rea—
sons for the overcrowding in class-
rooms need to be looked into, and I
propose that we have a study done by
each of the individual SEPC‘S into
how popular each class is in each
department. how many majors each
department has, and seeing what the
trend has been overthepastfew years.
This data when collected as a whole
can be presented to the administra-
tion and any change that has taken
place over the last few years can be
brought to the attention of the admin-
istration and we can ask the adminis-
tration to te-channel resources into
the departments that have more de-
mand compared to a few years ago,
and the departments that have less
demand maybe need lobe de-empha-
sized. Especially this year there has
been a large overcrowding problem

with new students and a lot of large
intro classesThisstudy wouldmostly
deal with why a lot of the senior
seminars are overcrowded. Rightnow
I am in a seminar with 17 other stu-
dents, and that just is not the seminar
setting thatl expected when I came to
Grinnell College.

Another issue facing SGA facing
the vice presidential position is
multiculturalism within our curricu-
lum. All the races, religions, sexes.
cultural groups, the needs of all these
groups really need to be addressed by
our administration, and I would pro-
pose open forums for the entire stu-
dentbody, speaking directly with dife
ferent leaders from different groups
on campus that are concerned with
the issric of multiculturalism and see-
ing what kind of input they want to
give me in order to give the adminis
nation potential changes that can be
instituted orother problems that need
to be addressed.

How will your past contributions
to the campus aid in your role as
SGA Vice-President?

As I said a little bit earlier in the
sec BRENTNALL page 7

 

Ostergren: Grinnell
Minors system will
”appear stronger"

What do you feel makes you the
best candidate for SGA Vice Presi-
dent?

I think the main thing is that] have
a strong platform — I think I have a
number of goals that are reachable
and managable and realistic, and I
think they would do some real im-
provement on the campus.

What doyousee as themost impor-
tant issues facing SGA?

In terms of the vice president’s
roe,l think that, referring to JUDCO.
I think the most imponant thing is its
role with the hall councils, I mean
with all the changes going on,
JUDCO’S going to have to change as
well, and I think SGA has to take a
real active role in rercvaluating how
fUDCO runs and what its purpose is.
There are a number of disciplinary
boards on campus and I think that we
have to really ask ourselves what the
justiﬁcation for JUDCO.

So you think that JUDCO needs to
be changed along with the change

from HACs to hall councils?

Sure, sure, because like I say in my
ﬂyer, the whole idea of the hall couna
cils system is to put more control of
govemztnccinto the hall and I think it
would be better, if that system is
going to go into effect, I think then
JUDCO is going to have to reﬂect
that.

And have JUDCO hold less power?

Well, yes, because I mean. for we
ample, if a lot of people tear up your
lounge, that gets taken care of within
the dorm instead of going to JUDCO
and going through the whole process.
I think IUDCO will have to change to
reﬂect that change in philosophy.

How will your past contributions to
the campus aid in your role as SGA
Vice President?

Well, I’m the Younker HAC right
now, I think I’ve grown in my posi-
tion and I think I‘ve got the experi»
