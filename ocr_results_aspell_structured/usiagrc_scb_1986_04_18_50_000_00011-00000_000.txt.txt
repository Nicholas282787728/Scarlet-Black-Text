Original Diirers and Rembrandts

on Display in Burling

riity-tive woodcuts. engravings, and etr
chings, illustrating the development of
Northern European printing from the 16th
to the 17th centuries, are on display in the
Print and Drawing Study Room in Burling
Library until April 26.

This exhibit demonstrates the influence
that the Early German masters, such as
Albrecht Duerer and Heinrich Aldegraver.
had on the later Northern European
printers, such as Anthony Van Dyke and
Rembrandt van Rijn, all of whom are
represented in the exhibit.

The Collection also reflects the chang-
ing political and artistic climates oi this

transitional historic period. The earlier
prints show lniiuences from the Italian
Renaissance, while the later prints depict
the rise of humanism and religious retor-
mation.

The exhibition of works by Aldegraver,
Duerer, Peter Breughcl the Elder,
Burgkmair, Pencz, van Leyden. Remr
brandt. Callot, Bosse. and many others. is
