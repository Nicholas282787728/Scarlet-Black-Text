. Opportunity Knocks

During the last week, plans for changes in
student government on this campus have
been debated in numerous “closed" sessions
throughout the men’s and women’s resie
dences. A student chapel was held to pre-
sent one plan to the students; and Monday
.night, another plan was presented to the
student body in house meetings. Today
the news columns of this paper carl‘ a
story regarding a petition which was circli-
lated in college residences last night, as
ing that the present student council auth-
.orize a constitutional convention to draw up
a new constitution to be Voted on by the
students at an unnamed date.

The Scarlet and Black is in favor of tllis
move. It seems sound reasoning to assume
that a constitutional convention, made up
of delegates from each of the men’s and
women’s residences, could meet to discuss

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

and decide upon the points of both plans [or
change, as well as the present system of
student government; and thereby formulate
2i concrete, workable, and practical procedure
of student government for G nnell college.

The task of revision, i1 it is deemed
necessary by the present Student Council,
weknow will be A hard one. It will, how-
ever, pr0\ do an opportunity {or intelligent
men and women to gain valuable xperience
in legal procedure The possibility of the
convention presents a challenge to “Grinnelle
minded" student . it is an opportunity for
effective leadership, intelligence, statesman-
ship, and responsibility to be asserted and
proved. And ollt of their efforts can
emerge an effective student government
plan for Grinnell College.

0 Thank You, Dr. Crane

We have on the campus this week a man
who may be properly teiined a religious
lecturer. To some of us, that phrase may
connote primarily a scholar who is out of
touch with practical life. But those of us
who have heard Dr. Crane so far know
without a doubt how erroneous is that idea,
for it would be hard to imagine aman with
a more dynamic personality, a man with a
keener understanding of life. His concep-
tion of Christianity is startling in simplicity

. and implication; his manner of address so

gripping as to leave the audience in com—
plete silence when he concludes. It is a
great tribute in itself to say that Dr. Crane
has penetrated the cynicism and indiffer-
ence to religion which has so often been
evident in college students here, has com-
pelled us to come back for more, and has
awakened us to serious thinking

For these reasons, Drl Crane is one of
the finer exponents of the spirit of former
President George Gates, in whose memory
this lectureship was founded President
Gates, himself a vivid personality and a
pioneer in religious thinking with a special
appeal to college students, is impressively
commemorated by Dr. Crane. To students
who have not heard him. we recommend a
great experience, and to Dr. Crane we offer
our sincere thanks for his inspiring presence
among us.

Too Much Unily’
Can Be Dangerous

Asserts W ritcr

”WINE-mum.

Now that the American elector-
ate, thinking and unthinking, has

registered its decision, and
Franklin D. is once more safely
ensconced in the White House
for another four years, ﬂie‘na-
ﬁon is wallowing in a deluge of
pleas for unity and the support
of the president.

Pnlu'ing down from all sides
upon a receptive audience, these
cxhortai-lons to forget our past
differences and m rally around
the chief executive in all his un-
demkings give the impression of
being 3L propaganda campaign
worthy of the mnster hand of
Nazi big-wig aochcis. Flag-wav-
Lug movie shorts urging mic and
all to jump on the band wagon
oi national solidarity, speeches
mm politicians of both past and
present importance, editorials in
Uutstamliug commercial am] colle-
giate publications—all thump the
tub to the time, “Now is the
time toi- every good man to he-
come a patriotic Democrat." ,, ,.

And to a certain extent this
sudden blossoming of brotherly
love may well be in the best my
terests of the United States. It is
quite mic that this country is
facing an unccmtcrhahlc World
situation, necessitating a vigorous
and integrated national policy.

And there is no doubt consider-
able truth in the change made by
certain of our "national unifiers”
that the totalitarian powers would
enjoy nothing more than seeing
the United States split asunder
by internal strife.

Unfortunately, however, not a.“
the current pleas for national
unity are based upon a. reasonable
View of the international situa-
(ion, not do all of them show
moderation in their demands for
naiiuuhl iuiicy.

Too mapy are founded upon the
1917 style of chauvinistic patrio-
tism, Too many cry for the re-
pression of all dissension, calling
for a. complete and unquestioning‘
support of the admmistration.
Perhaps these demands are not
made in so many words, but the
implication is as clear as the red-
whitc-and-blue hunting in which

they are draped .Criticism is in
danger of being repressed as
"unpctrlotic."

By thut we do not necessarily
mean that the third-berm ad~

' tration will openly embark
upon such s policy. Instead it is
more likely that h thick-headed
American public, plugged full of
cheap war-scare “patriotism," will
do the repressing. Tim, to us,
is the danger inherent in the cur-
rent drive for “national unity."
unity, yes. But Ilnlty which still
provides .1 place for justified and
intelligent criticism. That, moi-e
liihn anything else, is the hope
of America—and of democracy,

And it is our hope that the
"national unity" movement now
underway leads to that type of
unity and not to that kind which
excludes all but one point 0(
view.

Housemother Is Only Smith Resident
Exempted from Beard C rowing Race

By Clyde Bales.

Smith hall has declared that all
hail residents must grow a beam
in preparation for the Colorado
Rnundmp to hc held on Lhe Grin-
nell campus, Nov. 23, according
to Jack Frye, recreational (limb
cup of the Student Council, who
is in charge of the Round-up
preparations.

At a Kangaroo court held yes—
terday in Smith hall, men with-
out whiskers, or evidences of
efforts in that direction, were re-
qllired to wear raise beards, or
to paint on a “reasonable fac-
simiic thereof.”

Paul Boat, town associate of
Smith, was required to perform

a shaviiig‘opei-hlioh on himself in
front of the library yesterday at»
tel-noon, according to Frye. This
was the penalty imposed by the
court for his having shaved off a
promising beard he had been cultie
vnting’.

Frye stressed the point that the
beard growing part of the pro-
gram was for all men, and that
it was not to be a. contest for
heavily whiskcrcd students only.

This event is planned to en-
tertain the members of the
Colorado football tea in return
for the unusual hospitality which
was shown the Grinnell team at
Colorado Springs last ycsr, Frye
stated.
