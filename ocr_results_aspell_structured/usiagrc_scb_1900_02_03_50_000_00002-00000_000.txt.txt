"AN ENTHUSIASTIC meeting oi
the athletic union was held at
Close Hall last evening. The
meeting was called to order by
president Geo. w. Egan, atte. a
short time had been spent in sing-
ing university songs and yells. r

shortly after with the giving otthe

er. The above sentences clipped
from an article in arccentissuc of
the Vz'dzlff-Rzparlrr are indicativc
of theﬂinterest which is being mane
ifested in athletics by the student
body at the university. As a come
p‘arison we will give the condition
at the meeting of our athletic urie
ion held last Thursday. The
meeting was well advertised and
business of importance was to be
transacted. Butinsteadofhaving
"an enthusiastic meeting," the
few who were there at the ap
pointed hour were compelled to
go out and secure men irorn the
class rooms in order to secure a
quorum, Such a condition at at
tairs is a disgrace, and is one
which makes all friends of iowa
College athletics {ear for the fur
ture success of athletics at Grin-
nell. We have had a compara-
tively small number of students
with whom to carry on our athlet-
ics, yet every alumnus and every
trienol otthe college feels proud
of the record we have made in the
past. But this record
made by the telviit was not made
by the studentebody depending
upon a few to take interest in af-
fairs. It was made by “a long
pull, a strong pull and a pull ale
together,” which has been typical
oi Grinnell spirit in the past and
that spirit is just what is essential
to the success of Grinncll athlet-
ics at present and in the tuturc.
It is with regretthat we are forced
to admit that this lack ot interest
is shown not only by the small at
tendance at meetings oftlie union,
but also is becoming very eve
ident throughout the college
The fact that this comes at a
time when athletics need the sup-
port at every man in college is es-
pecially deplorable. We have at
rained successes in the past, and
we must get together and renew
the Grinnell spirit to its Oldrtime
form aud keep Grinnell athletics
up to the high standard which has
already been attained.

We seem to have given unstinte

true that the members of the

they aie excellent performers,
