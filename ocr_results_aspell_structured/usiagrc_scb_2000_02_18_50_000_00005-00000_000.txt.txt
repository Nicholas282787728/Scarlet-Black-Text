Artist 'of . the Week

I .
By Laura Hellman
Staff Writer

I had never ofﬁciallymer Rachel Melis, but,
as ir iswirh rhis arr'npus, l'vc seen her around
many rimes. What i rclcarned from my inter-
view wirh her, was rhe incredible arnounr of
ralenr rhar lies hidden in rhe srudenrs you see
everyday on rhis campus.

NoLonJywetc rhc areworks I gor ro sccwhar
makes Rachel rhe Artist or rhc Week, hur,1
found Rachel herselfro be arricularc, polished,
accomplished, and conscienrious

Before Grinnell, Rachel lived in Wiscon!
sin ar rhe shore ofLakc Superior. Rachel said
char she’s been inrcresrcd in her crcarive side
for “as longas [she] can remember.“ This mighr
have had somcrhing ro do wirh her family’s
arrisric background, Rachel's farhcr is an arrisr

who crcarcs porrcry, while her morher borh painrs his porrcry and does her own painrings.

Rachel remembers her firsr rasre of arr was drawing and doing warcroolors with her
morhcr. To rhis day, Rachel srill prefers ro sray wirh two-dimensional arrworks, conccn.
rraring her energies mainly inro drawing and prinr making. Despire rhc gorgeous sure
rounds ofhcr home in Lake Superior, Rachcl’s appreciarion for landscape. arr didn’r blos-
som unril she reached Grinnell.

Coming here, Rachel said she was probably “one ofrhe. few arr srudenrs who came [ro
Grinnell] inrending ro be an arr major." Alrhough, she admin, she was also leaning ro-
wards an English major. ,

Now. she says she is basically doing both majors, rhoogh only arr oFfrcially. Because of
her love ofrhc wrirren arrs, ir makes sense diat Rachel is currcnrly vcry inreresrcd in book-
making, Ln rhls form ofarr, she will be able ro combine rhe elcmcnrs ofcwo ofhcr loves:
illusrrarions and rem. , 7 . »

A rwo—ereda'r independenr class Rachel rook wirh Professor Bobbie McKibbin rhar
incorporarcd Rachel's aesr of bookmaking was one ofrhc mosr cxciring poinrs in her arris.
ric developmenr. This class focused on drawing landscapes and, in parricular, some ofrhe
heauriful homes around rhc rown ofcrinncll.

Rachel found rlris class even more fulfilling in an unexpected way: she found ir grear
for “gerring ro know iborh rhe places and rhe people of] rhc town.”

one day Rachel was working on a pasrcl drawing of one ofrhc houses in rown. Afrer
she had been working for a while, rhe woman who lived in she house came our ro talk ro
Rachcl, inreresred and ercired ro see how rhc drawing was developing. The woman rurned
our ro be a Grinnell alum and was pleased with Rachel’s rendirion rhar she called rhc
woman who aerually owned rhe house over ro come and ralk with Rachel. Rachel found
rhe whole inrcracrion pleasanrlysurprising; feeling more accsprcd inro the rown irself

Now, she has nor only an amazing piece ofarr ro lac proud of, bur Rachel also has a
heartwarming personal memory ro arrach ro rhc piece.

she says rhar arr is “calming" rn her, rhar ir helps ro pur her mind in order. Rachel
hopes rhar rhe medirarivc qualirics in her arrworle come across ro dross viewing rhcm, and
rlrar her works “make orhers look or irhe subjecr] in a difrcrcnr way, or see some aspecr of
their home or landscape rhar rhcy didn‘t noriec before."

She wanes rhosc who look or herworles ro slow down and conremplare rhe landscape,
like she does when she works. Also, she was quick to explain rhar alchough shc doesn'r
crcarc “political” pieces, she belicvcs drar everyrhing she rakes in from rhc world around
her goes into her works.

And Rachel rakes in many aspecrs ofrhe world around hcr.‘Shc is exrremcly inreresrcd
in lirerarure and arr from rhe orher parrs ofrhc world. One of her currenr classes, Narivc
American Lire'rarurc wirh Professor LeAnnc Howe, gives her more ofa pcrspccrivc inro
orhcr culrurcs and rheir modes ofcrprcssion.

Ashoit course lasr semcsrer on Chicano arr gave her insighrs inro that realm ofarr as
well. This course inspired her ro he more communitycotiented, and srarred her rhinking
abour working in murals or larger pieces. The facr rhar Rachel is a coordinator of rhe
EnvironmenralAerion Group on campus and that she is very inrercsred in environmcnral -
and prairie srudics arc borh hinred or in her artworks; especially rclling is her focus on ‘
landscapes. ‘

So whar does Rachel wanr ro do wirh her arr major? she is very inreresred in bookmak-
ing» and would like to illustrate children‘s books in Whichvd‘le int and text work together to
prescnr posirive cnvironmcnral messages ro children.
