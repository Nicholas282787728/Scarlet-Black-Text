Cubs and Rays make;
playoffs: apocalypse?

I don’t know what to do, l’m stuck in
that nebulous position between the unfath-
omable greatness that is a playoff berth for
theTwiris and another offseason of psyching
myself up into believing that Ron Garden-
hire can properly manage a bullpen. I just
don't know whether to give up baseball and
fully throw my support behind the Vikings
and Gus Frerottc or hope that a mini»VVhite
Sox collapse leads to even more baseball.
Even ifthe Twins don't manage to claw their
way into the postseason, there will still be
plenty of storylines to follow as anticipation
grows for the Fall Classic.

The best story is that of the Tampa Bay
Rays. No one expect-
ed them to overcome
their powerful AL
East rivals, and they
did so despite the fact
that they were hitwitli
injuries ranging from
Evan Longoria's fractured wrist and Rocco
Baldelli's mitochondrial abnormalities to
whatever causes Matt Garza to look high all
the time. This little team that could striige
gled mightily against their more powerful
foes, with few media members even giving
them a shot to ﬁnish third for the first time
in franchise history.

Then again, leaving prognosticarion up
to the likes ofSteve Phillips is as good ofan
idea as the NI-lL‘s goalie trapezoid. Other,
more reliable methods
of standings projections,
such as Baseball Prospec-
tus’s PECOTA, a statistie
cal system that projects
seasons for individual
players and combines
that with estimations for
playing time in order to
accurately predict team
outcome, had the Rays
winning 90 games, mak-
ing this team a far cry
from the underdog story that will be drilled
into your head so frequently you will beg for
a Frank TV ad.

Some will say you don't hear that much
about the Angels despite the fact that they
have the best record in baseball and they
will make some noise in the playoffs , or

 

trapezoid ”

”Then again, having prag—
ndsiitdlion up to the like; of
Steve Phillips is a: a good
didn idea as NHL’S goal/e

at least their fans will, Their fans will beat
those annoying thiindersticks incessantly,
that is, until the Red Sox offense tears apart
the Angels’ pitching so bad that Dr. James
Andrews wouldn’t be able to put it back to—
gether. The Angels are this year's Arizona
Diamondbacks. No, they aren’t as bad as
the 2007 Diamondbacks (at least they score
more runs than they give up) but they have
outperformed their expected wins total by
the same extraordinary margin ofeleven.

When 1 say expected wins, 1 mean the
simple formula created by Bill James based
on the idea that a team’s Win—loss record
should reflect their runs scored-runs given

up totals. The Angels

are sixth in the Ameri-

can League in run dife

L . fercntial, worse than

the fourrheplacc Blue

Jays You could say

that this just shows

that they have the ability to pull out close

games like other teams, or that they have

some sort of innate cltitchness about them,

but you would be wrong. or, at least, your

foundation for that claim would be as shaky

as the 1989 World Series. Regardless, ifmy

preVious predictions are any indication, the

Angels will run over the competition as if it

were Brian Bosworth en route to their sees
ond World Championship.

The National League is a whole differs
enr story with the Cubs
far and away the favorites
to take the NL pennant.
In my infinite wisdom I
chose to think that the
apocalypse was upon us
last year and that after
ninety-nine years of lov-
able loserdom, they would
finally break through and
win a title. I, an avid
study of the end oftimes,
failed to realize that only
numeric symbolism is a key to determin-
ing when and where the apocalypse will
happen. so now] know, on the hundredth
anniversary of their last World Series title,
one brought about by the miracle that was
Merkle's Boner, the Chicago Cubs will win
the World Series.
