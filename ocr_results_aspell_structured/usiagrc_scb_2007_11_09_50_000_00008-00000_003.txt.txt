Richardson faces large crowd, handles tough questions

EV DavroHr MONTGOMERY

New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Democratic candidate
for president, spoke Monday to a large crowd in the Forum South
Lounge, the ﬁrst othcial campus visit by a presidential candidate
this semester.

Richardson, a former ambassador and Energy secretary with
extensive diplomatic experience, spoke for around 25 minutes and
then rook questions for over an hour, delivering long responses to
audience members who often challenged
Richardson's views

Though Richardson impressed many at~
tendees with his candor and drew repeated applause, he may not
have attracted many new supporters to his campaign. Even though
more than 200 people attended Richardson's Monday event, a ma-
jority ofthem students. theTuesday night meeting ofSrndenrs for
Richardson was attended only by the group’s two leaders.

one factor hurting Richardson's electoral appeal is the elect—
ability parado . oters are unwilling to support Richardson (or other
low-polling candidates) because they do not seem likely to winili
self-fulﬁlling prophecy.

In fact, many attendees cited Richardson's low poll performance,
compared to fronterunncrs SenrHilliiry Clinton (N.Y.), Sen. Bariick
Obania (111.) and former schJOhn Edwards (NC),

“You can'tbut go into it thinking he's got a snowballs chance:
said attendee Harry Krejsa '10, who said he is uncommitted bur
leaning toward Obama,“lt's unfortunate,"

Thomas Huang ’09 also said that it seemed unlikely that Richr
ardson would win the nomination, but thought it well within p057
sibility that he would be a vice presidential nominee. Huang found

much to recommend Richardson from his performance

“I think he continued his srylc oftrying to be frank and speciﬁc

about his policies, which I do appreciate," Huang said, though
he vets “not particularly satisﬁed" by Richardson's answer to his
question about the governor's role in the 1999 prosecution of the
scientist Wen Ho Lee. '

Richardson went through a quick, ﬁverpoint stump speech ﬁlled

with policy proposals, bilt short on both discussion of funding and
on clear distinctions between him and other Democratic candidates.
Only on the issue oflrtiq did he draw an explicit contrast, pointing
out that his plain for complete withdrawal with no residual forces
(other than embassy guards) goes farther than his rivals for the
presidential nomination.

On other pointsieducation. health care, environmentalism
and energy independence and restoring America’s values and pres~
tigwRichatdson drew frequent applause
but rarely mentioned other Democratic
proposalslndced, when 1 ~ eech closed
with a request to consider supporting him for president, it almost
seemed like an nftci’thouglin

1n the long question-and-answcr period, though, Richardson
won praise for giving detailed answers, being unafraid to disagree
with questioners and for handling hostile questions with aplomb.

“I could certainly tell why he was such a good negotiator,"
Krejsa said. “He was very good with the back and forth and what
the audience threw at him."

The campus Students for Richardson President Garrett Fol'tin
’11 said he felt that the Richardson campaign “liked this meeting
because of the nice hard questions" that gave Richardson a chance
to show oli'his policy knowledge and engagement with voters.

Richardson answered almost all questions directly, at times fol»
lowing up his answer by asking the questioner what they thought
should be done. Only at the very end did he sidestep slightly—an-
swering a question about gay rights brieﬂy before scgueing to a
more general topic and avoiding a direct answer altogerher to a
question about which Republican candidate he would prefer to
run against,

Throughout Richardson's speech and responses,seveml key ele-
ments of his campaign stood out. He highlighted repeatedly two
key selling points ofhis candidacy: his governing experience as the
governor orNew Mexico. and his diplomatic experience negotiat—
ing directly with unsavory regimes. With every other Democratic
candidate coming from the legislature, Richardson seized on his

ardson

experience in those two areas to contrast himself, usually implicitly,
with his rivals.

Richardson also came out in support of two muchsdebared
constitutional amendments: the Equal Rights Amendment and a
Balanced BudgetAmendment. Despite pledging his support for the
latter, Richardson did'not discuss potential funding sources other
than spending for the Iraq war, which he would end.

He also committed to spending $50 billion peryear to spread
untirAIDS medicationsworldwide,expressing support for the U.N.~
Millennium Development Goal orspending one percent ornational
income on foreign aid. (Deborah Kaiser ’08, who asked Richardson
to committo this spending, asked the same question ofSen.Cliris
Dodd (Conn) during his visit to town.Dodd expressed support for
the goal but declined to commit to ti speciﬁc number.)

Richardson’s response to it question about immigration high»
lighted the governor’s willingness to give frank answers that his
audience might disagree with, Richardson endorsed the controver
sial immigration compromise proposal by senators John McCain
(R’Al’lls) and Edward Kennedy (DrMasstIhis compromise has
detractors on both the right and left,and Richardson acknowledged
that criticism, saying that the proposal was “not perfect"but better
than the alternatives, which Richardson said were doing nothing
about illegal immigration or deporting 12 million illegal aliens.

Throughout the event, the large crowd was fairly restrained,
applaudingwhen they heard things theylilted. but falling short ofa
rally atmosphere. Forrin said he liked the subdued environment.

“It was quieter, but probably more meaningﬁil," Fortin said.
"What we had here was more ofa policy discussion,"

Max Postman ’08, who engaged Richardson in a brief debate
about the U.Sr's nuclear deal with India, said that he had mixed
feelings about Richardson as a candidate but enjoyed the event.

“I thought it was amazing that he spent as much time as he did
on campus," Postman said. "He really made a big commitment to
campus, I think it was a fantastic experience for everyone, [W] 1
hope we're going to get more candidates.”
