\d Concert, the members of the T1 ,
Kenneth Goldsmith, Terry King
and John Jensen, along with Mr,
Leichtling, will give a lecture
demonstration in Main Hall at 9:00
pm. on November 3. The purpose
of this dorm concert-lecture Will be
to acquaint listeners with the two
works. The Trio will play excerpts
irom the two compositions as Mr.
Leichtling provides a running
commentary on the structure and
form of both works.

Mr Leichtling’s Trio was written
in Grinnell and is the second of
several major works which he is
writing tor the members oi the
Mirecourt Trio. His Violin Sonata,
Opusss, was given its premiere last
spring by Goldsmith and pianist Jo

GAnne Ritaeea. Later this year,
Terry King and John Jensen will
give the premiere oi Mr.
Leichtling’s Cello Sonata. Other
works oi Leichtling's to be given
this year will include the premiere
oi his second Piano Sonata, a new
work ior piano and soprano, and a
second performance of his “A Book
oi Madrigals," which was per
t'ormed last year by the Grinnell
Singers.

The Trio to be performed

' aNovember 5th is a very large and

extremely ditiicult coma
position lasting nearly 40 minutes.
It is in two movements which were
\ designed to show off the Trio in the
emost brilliant way possible. It is
probably one oi the tew major
works ior Piano Trio written In the
recent 20th century. The only
major work tor the ensemble
written in recent historical limc is
Ravel’s work which was completed

in 1914.

Bumbeck iniaglios
criticized

b) Robert Waldnci'

First, I think that in the long run,
everyone has to judge works oi art
by their own standards. However,
it you think you don't know
anything about art, this t ‘tique
can he helpiul by showing you on
what basis art can be Judged

Generally. I didn't like the
Bumbeck exhibit which was on
display in Scheaiier Gallery this
past week. A typical Bumbeck
intaglio shows a iigure with strong
shadows in the ioreground. The
background is usually an interior
or a starkrlooking outdoor scene.
This brings me to my iirst
criticism. The prints vicre made
over a period oi seven years
Unless an artist has hit upon a
“perfect solution," which is
seldom the case, I think he should
be constantly refining and
developing his style, Bumbeck’s
work shows little in the way of
development. With the exception oi
maybe one or two prints. all of the
works are much the same. This
suggests to me that Bumbeck may
be resting on his reputation. 5
work lacks any kind of ex-
perimentation or iorward direc-
tion.

Because at the strong and
unusual lighting on the iigures and
the lonely settings they are placed
in, I judge that Bumbeck was

Drawings condemn Nazi horrors

V Ellen Walker

“Dignity is not a symbol
bestowed on man nor does the word
itseli possess force. Man’s dignity
is a iorce and the only modus
vivendi by which man and his
history survive. When midr
twentieth century Germany did not
let man live and die with this right,
man became an animal. No matter
how technology advanced or
sophisticated, when man negates
this divine right he not only
becomes sell-destructive, but
castrates his history and poison:
our future, This is What the Nazi
drawings are about ”

University at Iowa. The exhibition
in the University of Iowa Museum
of Art, Sept. 247Nov. 28, 1975 in-
cludes these drawings as well as a
number oiexcellent intaglio prints.
I wish to concentrate on the
drawings in this review. 0i the
over 60 onerman exhibitions
honoring Lasansky this is the first
to include the Drawings in their
entirety.

The 33 drawings in this series
create a most poweriul and
terriiying eulogy to the insanity oi
World War ll Germany They
should be experienced rather than
analyzed. The drawings are
massive—liie-size or greateriand
are executed With only a lead
pencil, earth colors. turpentine
wash, and a commercial paper.
The simplicity oi the medium
reﬂects the artist's desire to
present the theme as clearly and
unatiectedly as possible.

Lasansky uses only a few images
to depict the subjects oi his
drawings but the dynamic
variations keep his work irom
becoming repetitive. The series is
to be “read” as a progression irom
the harsh side views of Nazi
soldiers, their helmets distinctly

human skulls; to the voluptuous,
absurd prostitutes; through the
agonized iniants and ending with
the paradox of the bishops and
priests “blessing” the dead. Each
segment begins with a very bold
statement of the subject, isolated
and stark. The lines are definite
and large areas oiblack created by
bold strokes oi the pencil draw the
viewer into the next stage oi the
series.

In the latter hall of the series
bold numbers appear in the works
as referents to the concentration
camps’ system at dehumanizauon
Lasansky also utilizes a collage
technique to emphasize the
images Often the collage is
created by using pages oi the Old
Testament either as background or
structurally in the image itself.

This visual essay is deiinitely
symbolic but far irom esoteric.
The works are more than a
statement but a bold Condemnation
oi the horrors oi Nazi Germany.

The best way to get lhis eitect. 1

stark realistic Burnt) does a

However, the aces of all of the

successlul technique. The inn
congruity detracts irom the eiiect
oi the prints A good example oi
what I mean can be seen in
“Sunbathers II" where one ot the
tigllrcs‘ heads isn't even attached
to her body correctly I also might
mention that in many ot the prints,
the figures are separate irom the
rest of the composition. That is, it
appears almost as it the iigures
were drawn separately irom the
backgrounds and then just stuck
into the Composition This made
me feel uncomfortable. though
perhaps, this was Bumbeck's in-
tention.

Last. I'd like to say what I think
about Bumbeck's use of the
medium, Color, it used in intaglios,
should be part oi the whole print.
The intaglios‘ in Lasansky’s
exhibit in Iowa City, for example,
are almost all in color. Lasansky
uses color lo achieve several
diiierent eiiects and always in-
tegrates it with the rest oi the
composition. Bumbeck’s addition
oi color to his intaglios seems to be
a second thought. It almost always
appears as a solid color patch in
some small area oi the print. In
many cases, the color patch
replaces a section oi a first, black
and white version oi the print, such
as in ”Pictures" and “Variations
of Pictures," This indicates to me
that color was not integrated in the
idea oi the print but simply tacked
on to the image later.

Finally, it is possible to achieve a -
practically limitless number of
eiiects using the intaglio process.
Many textures and patterns can be
printed, The Lasansky intaglois in
lowa city or the Kollowitz prints in
the exhibit that preceded the
Bumbeck exhibit are good
examples oi the potential oi the
intaglio process Bumbeck sticks
mostly to simply line etches, using
aquatint on the iigures, and sol~
tgrounds irom iabrics on objects in
his prints that would normally be
covered in fabric (e.g. clothing or
furniture) His explorations of the
possibilities of intaglio are few and
his prints are unexceptional.
