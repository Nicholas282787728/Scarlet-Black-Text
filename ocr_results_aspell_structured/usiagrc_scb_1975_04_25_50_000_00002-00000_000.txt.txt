'PhiBeui
Kappa
chosen

Twentysnine seniors and seven
Juniors listened to Neal w.
lKlausner speak on “The Unity of
Scholarship" Tuesday, then
walked to the front oi Herrick
Chapel to collect Phi Beta Kappa
membership certiiicates in the
annual conlerral oi the
distinguished awards,

The ceremony, presided over by
Grinnell chapter president David
w. Jordan, was expecially
signiticant because the featured
speaker, Miller prolessor or
philosophy Klausner, had recently
become the first member or the
Grinnell chapter ever elected a
senator of the United Chapters oi
Phi Beta Kappa.

Klausner’s presentation, which
lasted 20 minutes, emphasized the
critical importance of scholarship.
Nnting with concern the deep gap
between the sciences and the
humanitiesiﬂhe chasm between
the library and the laboratory”7
Kiausner put forth scholarship as
the single unifying tactor between
even the most disparate fields of
study.

”It is scholarship.” said
Klausner, “that unites the diverse
interests and gives purpose,
achievement, and justification to
our existence. Our unity does not
lie in the multiplication of Courses
and the transparent attempt to be
fashionable and relevant,

"Our unity is not to be found in
raculty committees, in student
government, in trustee hyslaws, in
administrative promises, or in
alumni loyalties,” he Continued.
“It is found in the extent, the
quality, and the continuity to
transmit it to those who share in
the excitement of learning,”

Definlng scholarship as “ideas
refined and Clarified by a
disciplined intelligence," Klausner
called it the the only refuge
available from Common nonsense.
He charged his listeners to avoid
thc all too frequent conlrontations
and cfironteries of “the misguided
and the ignorant who want only to
give us an emotional bath."

Klausner warned\ of the “ob-
stacles” of dealing with anti-
intellectuals and with those that
“Claim that if men are created
equal they are also to be graded
equéll,’ Hc cautioned the inductees
ot “the indit‘lerence to graceful
and precise speech which has
cmharrased language with in
dignities and cluttered it with ‘you
knows' and ‘I lneans,‘ hesitant
grunts and muttering: until the art
of conversation has often been
degraded into a tortuous ex-
pel'ience." .

In another vein, Klausner
referred to the Institutionalized
tii-npoviiic. a semiannual student
publication rating proicssors and
courses Klausnel'. his lolce laced
wtth sarcasm. cited “that brilliant
Grlnliell Resource, the
Grapevine which shows the
astonishing insights and surprising
critical powers oi about so per cent
of the students." He added that “it
has all the moral sensitivity of an
unsigned letter or an obscene
