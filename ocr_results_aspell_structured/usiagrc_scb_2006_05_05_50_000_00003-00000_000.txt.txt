Libertarian opposes universal health care

on Wednesday night, Mike Tans
ner and Bret McFarIirt engaged in a
debate on universal health care, a do»
hate organized by the Student Came
paign tor lnereased Political Engage
ment (SCIPE). Tanner, a libertarian
from the CATO Institute whose cell
phone rings with the Mission lme
possible theme, addressed a South
Lounge packed with Grinnell stu—
dents on the beneﬁts ofan individual,
not universal, health care system.

In the end, the question is
who's going to control
the money and who’s
going to control the
decision making. 1
would suggest what
we should do is re
turn the money, and
with that the deci—
sion-making power, to

_ individual consumers
You can’t stay in the
middle of the road because the current
system is irrational, it's broken, it will
fall apart.

Government is good for protecting
our rights to life, liberty [and] property.
The government should be there to
run a defense and court system, police,
things of that nature designed to protect
us Government should not be in the
business of ordering our lives, whether
that’s in terms of our pocket boole our
bedroom, our law, our businesses.

Well, we need to find ways to deal
with poverty in this eounrry and 1 her
licve there’s a lot of things we can do.
I believe one of the biggest barriers to

wealth creation in this country is the
government. The government through
its regulation prevents people from
starting businesses, the government
through tax policies which suck busi»
nesses our ofthe inner city, education
system that leaves millions unable to
read and the math necessary to get by
in life.I believe the first thing we need
to do is stop the government from doe
ing harm and then we can have it dis
cussion about what is the best way to
redistribute wealth, which I believe is
through civil society, voluntary personal
charities

your polity? W/m lorer

out?

I believe there

wrll always be people
who fall through the
cracks in any system.
In the healthcare sys-
tem, the poor peo 1e
who have language for
other] barriers to
care are the ones who
fall through. For example, they’ve done
studies comparing states that offer free
vaccination and states that charge and
they’ve found that there’s virtually no
difference. The barrier to vaccination
tends to be not money, but culture, edue
cation levels, language barriers, things
ofthat nature. So I think we need to be
targeting those things,

W/ml merit! of lieu/[b true are you
ran: afraid of?

I very much am opposed to a sys»
tem in which the government would
become the single payer of health care
and would set universal budgets that
would control what health care is avail-
able to individuals and would decide
for individuals whether or not they can
have a given pioeednre and would de-
cide how many MRI units would be In
the country.

I reject the idea that people are ope
posed to health care reform because
they don't think people are deserving of
health care. Everybody wants to see We
erybody get health care, at least I know
I (10.1 think the question is whether or
not the we believe the government can
provide health ears tor everyone, We
know that in other countries that have
socialized medicine, it doesn't provide
health care for everyone. It pretends to,
it promises to, it gives people a piece
ofpaper that says it will but in the end
it doesn’t. We need to have an honest
debate and understand that there's not
enough money in the world to give eve
erybody every bit of health care that
they want. What we have to do is de—
cide who is going to make the decisions
on rationing. whether it’s going to be

it’s the individual.

We haven’t seen the government
create things better than the private
sector before we ern make jokes
about FEMA. But the fact is, the prie
vate sector was much better able to
handle the disaster of Hurricane Ka-
trina than‘the government. Wal-Mart
was able to move bottled water to New
Orleans while FEMA was srill trying
to ﬁnd New Orleans on a map. The
fact is, there is very little the governe
llleut has done that really works well
and the private seeror has created the
greater society that’s out there — with
inequality, with problems that need to
be fixed. still, this is the place you want
to be born

Tanner on
Cato

The libertarian Cato
institute advocates
policies that restrict
the role of government
in lavor ol individual
rightsAs a result, they
oppose policies popu-
lar both on the left

and on the right. Cato
researcher MichaelTan-
net on his institute:

“We believe in individ~
ual liberty. free markets
and peacewt're prob»
ably the only organi-
zation out there that
would reduce or limit
all social wellare pro-
grams, cut the defense
budget. iegalite drugs,
prostitution [and]
gambling. Our big ques-
tion on gay marriage

is whether you should
permit gay marriage
or whether the state
should be forbidden

to recognize marriage
at all.We have some
policy guaranteed to
annoy everybody."
