THE SCARLET AND BLACK

May 14, 197}.

Baseball TeomComes Through With A Win!

Well, followers, it has hap~

pened, just as I kept predict-
ing that it would. Tuesday
afternoon, Grinnell’s Baseball
Pioneers gained a split of a
doubleheader against William
Penn College, winning the first
game, 3-2, in 10 innings. I'IOW’
ever, the Pioneers soon re-
verted to type and lost the
second game, 1371, in 4 inn-
ings.

The humiliation of Penmoc
curred when the Pioneers
played the sterling defense of
which they‘re capable, and
combined diis with a masters
ful 3 hit performance by Mike
Levy on the mound. Even so,
it took some last minute her
nice (twice, even) before the
game could be pulled out. With
the score 271 in favor ofPenn,
in the seventh inning, Bruce
Rollins hit a two out, 2»2pitch
for a home run to send the
gme into overtime. Then, in
the tenth, with runners on
first and second, Bill Johnson
tame up with his first hit of
the season to drive across the
winning marker.

In the second game, it was

just like old times, ashowie

Horwitz started on thathound ‘

and had control problems,
Eric Hines relieved‘and got
bombed, and Wes FiijII fin‘
ished and the Grinnell defense
fell apart. The Pioneers ap-
peared to be living too much
in the past during this second
game. .

As for the next years, this
is a young team and will im-
prove steadily, and more rape
idly. If a halfway decent crop
of preps come in over thenext
two years, Grinnell should be
able to climb out of the cellar
and be respectable again.

The Grinnel tennis team won
two out of three meets last
weekend to finish the season
6-3 in the Midwest Confer-
ence, one oftheir best win-
loss records in severalyears.
Ripon, St. Olaf, andMonmouth
were the only conference op-
ponents able to defeat the
strong Pioneer team.

Last weekend, the netmen
beat Beloit 7-2 and Knox 5-4
before losing to Monmouth
5-4. Against Beloit, every
Grinnellian except Dave Bee-
man won singles, but he was

Grinnell Invites Wrong Team!

The Grinnell invitational
Track Meet, the first ever,
was practically a disaster for
the hosting Pioneers. Plagued
by the absence of Morales,
who was trying to get a life
guard job for the summer,and
many legs full of cortisone,
the Scarlet and Black had to
settle for 2nd, fighting off
Cornell but always behind

Pfitsch, I. Rollie Honored

The Honor G Banquet was
held last Mondaynightin Cow-
les Hall. At this banquet, a
number of MVP awards were
given, culminating in the hon-
oring of the retirement from
coaching of Dr. John Pfitsch.
Winners were: in football,
most valuable back wash/lario
Bognanno and most yaluable
linemen, the duo of Mortimer
Hamilton and little Jim Ed‘
wards. Eric Jahn swept hone
ors in cross country and
track, sharing the track MVP
with ChuckyMcGrath. Top Mat
Rat was Washington Alston.
Top Guppie was Jollie Rollie.

The basketball team MVP
was forfieted and there was
no mention of the baseball
team at all, much to both's
chagrin. Tennis is not over
yet and remained silent in
anticipation of the conference
meet.

The most outstanding Fresh»
man athlete was the mostout»

its way into Mario’s pocket.
The outstanding Senior award
went to All-American J. Rol-
lie, much to his embarass—
ment.

The end of the banquet was
all John Pfitsch, the Pfighting
mentor of the basketball team
for 23 years, He seemed to
think that the celebration was
because he stepped down, but
it proved to all of us present
that the honor was for a most
respected, least understood
man. We won’t miss him
drough because he will still
be athletic director. Just ask
him about it if you have a day
or two. Maybe he will tell you
about life's three greatest
pleasures. Oh Brother]

William Penn.

Chuck McGrath again showed
that he is one of the best dis-
tance runners around. Winning
the mile and 3 mile events,
he rubbed it in by setting
track records in both. Chris
Madson excelled and won his
much specialized event, the
pole vault, by going 14‘ 0".

Now we get down to the nice
efforts: 2nd places were ach—
ieved by Bill Swan in the 880.
Eric Jahn in the mile, Jon
Gray in the high hurdles, and
Dave Russell in the 5 mile,
Jim Pirolli in the 440hurdles,
and Mr. Huff in the shot.

Grinnell haslmlly got beaten
in the field events as William
Penn took 5 of the 7 events.
The scoring went William
Penn 95 l/2, Grinnell 65 1/2,
Comeli 56, Simpson 32, Cen‘
txal 22.

This week is the conference
meet at Cornell's slow track.
Grinnell could do respectably,
but it looks as if 1st and 2nd
are between St. Olaf and Coe,
Anyway, we could have some
winners in McGrath, Morales,
and Huff. Hell, anything can
happen at Grinnell, ask Al
Schoene or the baseball team.

At Knox, the Pioneers won
their third 5-4 thriller of the
year. After the singles, the
score was 3-3 as #1 Brad

doubles duds, Vazales~Bee-

Schoene’s Hole

The Grinnell golfteam, hope~
fully inspired by Al Schoene’s
recent hole-intone, played in
the Midwestern Conference
Meet at Ellis Park in Cedar
Rapids yesterday and today.
Results were unavailable at
press time.

The team was not expecting
a high finish but there should
be some improvement from
last year's tenth place finish.

The golfers farednottoo well
in two meets held the week
before last. They were de-
feated by Coe, Knox, Beloit,
and Carleton at Cedar Rapids
on the 3rd. The next day at
Iowa City the team was in
good position after the first
18 holes, ahead of four teams
and tied with four others in

KnetmenKnuckIe Knox, Beloit

Beeman, and #5 Carlos Men-
doza came out winners. In
doubles, only the Vazales-
Beeman duo was able to win.

This weekend, Coach Pfitsch
takes the team to the Mid
west Converence Meet in Ce-
dar Rapids where the Pion~
eers are shooting for a finish
well into the upper half of the
league. BradVazales andDave
Beeman willprobahly be seed-
ed in the singles, and the team
will likely gain doubles'seeds
also.

The individual conference
win-loss records for the top
six players in singles this
year were: Brad Vazales 5-2,
Ken Schofield (who began ten»
nis at age 8) 4—5, Jim Spell
3-3, Dave Beeman 7-2, Bruce
Bonnewell 3-5, and Carlos

teams.

Schoene's hole‘in-one came
last Tuesday while playing
with Skip Tredway and Jerry
Switzer from town: He aced
the 147 yard 9th hole with a
six iron into a strong cross-
wind.

The players at conference
are Skip Tredway, Bill Chown,
John Otto, Al Schoene, and
Todd Wheeler. Gary Johnson
was unable to make the trip.
It has been rumored that Coach
Edd Bowers has secretly been
sharpening his game for the
annual encounter with the
other conference coaches.
