Scarlet & Black

 

The ﬁrst entry for the Bowling Writers Contest

by Heidi Hopkins

Panting, his chest heaving, he staggered
towards the building that lie ahead, not
knowing how tar hehind they were or even
if they were still following. He dared not
turn around nor stop. As he reached for the
door, he looked up at the sign, Northwest
Bowling, then burst inside.

He winced under the bright lights and
guided himself with one hand against the
wall as his eyes adjusted to the glare The
door had shut quickly behind him and he
moved forward into the crowd to avoid be-
ing seen by anyone else who might enter.
Slowly regaining his composure, he looked
around, taking in his new surroundings,
The building was long and rectangular,
Along one long halt there were sloped rows
ot chairs which were tilled with people, He
found himself in the middle of a crowd at
the base of these. and pushed forward to
see what everyone was watching. Several
people glared at him as he passed but it
didn't bother him. He was far beyond car-
ing about a iew dirty looks and too tired
and scared to worry about beng polite.

He squeezed into the front row of
standees and found himself facing a roped
on section ot approximately 15 howling
lanes. As he watched, a young man let go

of a ball. The previously hushed crowd let
out a cheer and applauded wildly at the
resulting strike. The young man turned to
the crowd with a grin, waved, and took a
seat.

At the far end ot the lanes, he spotted a
sign, Perhaps it would tell him where he
was, hut he couldn’t read it without getting
closer. He litted the rope and ducked
underneath. The crowd shouted alter him
as he walked down his length 01 the lanes,
l-ie ignored them and kept walking.
Another young man had litted his hall and
was preparing himseli tor his throw but
turned and glared as the intruder walked
by, He was so tired, how tar had he run.
anyway? it seemed that these lanes would
never end and he had counted nine before
he could read the sign: “Bowling rinals,
Crosby High vs. st. Charles Academy."
This was followed by the wins and losses of
each school’s season, which he couldn’lsee
without his glasses l-iis glasses. They had
been broken at some point in the shuttle
earlier in the evening. Thinking or the
glasses reminded him oi his p irsuers. He
turned quickly and looked behind him a
were they in here? Had they seen him? So-
meone in black was walking toward him.
He wanted to run but knewit was too late.

They had guns and this was a clear shot.
Closer. Closer, His heart was pounding and
the noise of it echoed in his ears, A
policeman. it was only a policeman asking
him to please get on the tloor. He told the
officer that he was a member ol‘ the Crosby
team and that he had just arrived. What a
nice policeman this was a showing him to
the Crosby team seats. kidding the others
about stragglers. The team looked rather
confused, He smiled to himself as he took
off his leather jacket and stuffed it under
the seat. He grabbed what looked like a
warmrup jacket and pulled it on. Hopelul-
ly, it they were in the building, they hadn't
yet spotted him, and wouldn't even
recognize him now. After all, they had
never gotten a good look at his face, After
snapping on his jacket he looked back
down the lanes. The second bowler had
just finished his string and the crowd had
long since lost interest in the strange man
who had crossed the ropes.

The announcer was speaking —
something about St. Charles being finish»
ed, and then something about Crosby’s last
two bowlers who would now try to equal or
top their challenger's score. He sat back
and shut his eyes A time to rest, pray,
prepare for who knew what.

He stood up and walked towards the hall
chute. Members of the team were asking
each other what was going on and who that
was. But he didn’t turn, dldn‘tanswer their
calls He seemed to have lost all control.
He heard the announcer call on a numher
and a name — it must he the jacket he had
on. He picked up a ball Had he ever howl
ed before? He couldn’t rememher There
was dead silence as he stood and prepared
to howl, but he wasn't sure it the silence
was real or just in his head. it was so
deathly quiet l-le concentrated on the pins,
staring. Slowly he stepped forward and
swung his arm, The weight oi the arcing
black hall seemed to pull him over Then it
dropped and he found he was still standing,
He watched it roll. It moved so slowly.
Surely he had thrown it harder than that.
He stared at it and the blackness tilled his
eyes Would it ever reach the pins? Would
it be a strike:y A roaring tilled his head
The cheering ot the crowd? No, the rolling
hall Or was it? The noise, roaring louder,
louder. The ball, rolling closer, closer. He
held his head to block out the noise but
couldn't pull his eyes trom the hall.

CRACK!

His body slumped against the locked
door or the building.
