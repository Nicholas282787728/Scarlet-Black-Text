I have promised myself that I would never write this column
except as a filler, and 1 need tiller-,thisweek, This is a column
to tell women how to watch football games. ‘ ,

First or all, at a football game there is the flip of the coin
wherein the referee flips a coin in the air rind one or the
other of the opposing captains calls it heads or tails.

This is why the referees and. the captains gather _at the
middle of the field after warmsupsito trip the Colin Whichever
captain wins the flip pets to decide whether to receive or kick

in the cunference‘meet.

Off to the other team or to take either the north or south goal ‘

to defend. — .

Almost every captain will choose to receive the kickoff
if he wills the flip. since that will give his team the first chance
to score, ’ ,

VVllen the captains have decided Who will kick off and who
'VIill receive. the two teams line up facing each othl‘r, \vltll
1neir backs to the goal line they have chosen_to defend. The team
that. is kicking off lilfes up in a stl‘alght line so they "Will all
liejdble to get. down field as fast as possible after the luck. The
man who is going to kick the ball standsia little behind the
other men so he can get a run before he kicks the ball, ,

,The team which is going to receive the kick sort. of spreads
out, but none of [item can get any closer than twenty yards
to the yard line the ball is on before it is kicked. The slower
linemen are in frank, and the speedier hnc are farther back
where the kick will come down. '

Vl/hen the ball is kicked, the slower linemen in front start
knocking down men from the team that kicked off SO they
will not be'able to catch the speedy back who has caught' the
kick and is running with it. .

This is called blocking, but almost always some of the men
on the kickeoff team don’t get blocked, and they run down and

'catch the man who got the kickeotf and throw their arms around
him and smash him to the ground. The yard line where they
throw him down becomes the line of scrimmage, and the team
that caught the kick starts on Offense.

The team on offense has four downs to go 10 yards down
the field from their originaluline of Scrimmage. They must go
forward a if they go 10 yards backward it doesn't count.

If they go 10 yards forward within four downs or less they
get a new original line of scrimmage from which to go it} yards
forward and get a new line of scrimmage, etc., until they make
a touchdown. , -. ,

r A touchdown occurs when a man runs across the goal line
with the ball under his aim“ or Someonc throws the ball to
someone behind the goal line and he catches it.

Every time the offense makes their 10 yards in four downs
or less it is called ”they made a first down." They usually (it)
this by running and trying to make as much as they can on the
first and second downs. c ,

On the third down if’ they have quite a ways to go, the
'quarterback, tvho decides what the team will do on every play,
will often decide to try a pass. It is easier to make long yard—i
age passing than running.

if the yardage ls shortisay three yards or less to g
third down.‘ the quarterback would probably call another
This is not always the way the downs go because sometimes
the quarterback gets tricky and tries to fool the other team or
“gambles,”

If the team hasn’t made its first down by time for the
fourth down, they will probably punt, which ,is just like a
.kick-off except that the kicker doesn't lay the hall dawn and
Sonic of the ,rlefensive men try to run in and block the kick.

The team which catches the punt then runs it. back as far
as they» can until their man gets tackled. Then they have a
first-down, and the two teams have traded places on offense
and defense. This trading'back and forth and trying to score
touchdowns goes on for an hour, which is divided into four
quarters, at the end of which the team that has scored the
most touchdowns and extra points wins.

. Extra points can be gained on the play right after the touch-
down and before the kickeoff, which comes after every touch»
down as well as at the start of each half.

This is all that is important for girls to know about foot-
ball. There are other things which may happen during the
game. but. these will be beyond the scope of this column. Your
date or another nearby fellow will have to explain.

Coach Young is fairly optimisA‘
tic about this year's prospects.
He reports that the team should‘
be as good or bettcr than lastl
year’s third—place finish, event
though the two top runners were‘
graduated. “We have more depth,
and better balance than last
year," he said,

Although only the first five.
men on a term count in the scar

ing in a cross-country meet, the
team's sixth and seventh men can
push the opponents score higher
by finishing in front of any of
the latter's first flVe runnersr
Expecting more help from
the sixth and seventh men on
this year’s squad, Young stated
that the Pioneers “in be in
title contention “if we bring
the bottom _nlcn up to the top i
and if we Work hard."
The Coach is also hoping ihatl
he will have his club at tull‘l
strength throughout the cntircl,
season. injuries played a maior‘
role last year and greatly handi-
capped the team in nearly every
meet. ‘
The following men, ranked ac-

ri a practice moot with Drake,
will probably reprsscnt the Pio-

Winiecki and Risscr. l

Attending a summer institute
at MIT and unable to return

banks repnrtcd in good shape,
and his constant improvement
should soon challenge‘lhe other
top runners on the Squad. .

At present Dick rlsher is

lost to the team for a week or

more after injuring his foot.
and Paul Risscr has not yet
reached peak performance he» i
cause of leg injuries. l

Coach Young sees Cornell as
one of the top teams in the con-
ference and thinks that it may‘
be the team to beat. They have:
three or four good men. including
Homer Lotimer and the best‘
freshman in’ last year's tele,
