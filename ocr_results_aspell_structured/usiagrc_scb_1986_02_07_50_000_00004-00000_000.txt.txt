A
Case of

Censorship?

on my first day an the Job editing the Sets, I
stumbled across what most college newspaper
editors dream 0/. That's right: purely by accl-
.ent, I encountered controversy

last weeh, on 8&8 reporter interviewed a

ember of the faculty for information to be less
d in a feature story. At that time, I was told
the professor gave the interview freely ‘

Later, however, that individual tried to exert
control over the content of the article. At first,
he/ahe wanted to change words in the reporter's
writeup of the tntervt‘ew Later, they also
wanted their name withdrawn from the story,

Of course, none of that is legal once an in-
dividual has given an interview, they have no

The reporter writing the story lri/ormed me of
his/her t‘ntervi‘ewee‘s ob/ections the morning the
paper went to press, Reluctant, but feeling we
were on secure legal ground in this instance, I
refused to comply- with those ObJECtLOM

[guess I expected to hear more, Nonetheless,
I was surprised at the immediate response the
decision to run the article caused. I was almost
immediately deluged with calls from an ad-
ministration ol/lclal, the aggrieved professor,
and another faculty member.

When 1 was finally able to speak to the ad
ministration o/ftcuzl, he leaned on me pretty
hard. Though he expressly stated they would
not stop publicatton of the story, he told me the
.rofesaor was very upset, that he had threatens
ed to go to thc presldcnl of the college, and that
changing stories tn this way was a common are

esst‘onal practice.

He suggested that we delay publication of the

tary, Get together and talk over its content, he
said

At that point, talking it over did not seem to
be it promising allentattue The professor had
lready changed llts/her account of what had

appened: originally. he/shc had acknowledged
the information in the story was accurate, but

later claimed 11 contained distortions

Feeling the weight ofa college admlnlstmlmn

itting on me, I backed down The story did not
run

It was a small but sobering lesson which
reminded me of what I've come to believe is the
unfortunately conditional nature of our Flrst

‘memimznl press freedom,

All to often. that freedom seems to ball Iltnc
tion of economic power. A community paper
dependent on advertisers for its existence 7 or
. campus paper running on funding from the
college — may be severely hampered in its ezer
else of press freedom

For instance, I believe I can Safely predict
that the Newton Daily News will never print
anything that is even remotely critical 0/

aytag Corporation a the town's most power-
ful economic asset.

Admittedly. I think the College’s: administm-
tum is usually too reasonable to exert that kind
of heavy-handed control over the 8&8. Given
the paper's usual content, it would seldom be
necessary.

Last Thursday, on the other hand, it was

. definitely using its considerable influence to
rush a pom! one 0/ their ofﬁcials later admitted
was indefensible.

I'm not trying to bhirne individuals [or what
happened last weeli. In nearly all cases, it seems
that the people involved were simply doing
what their jobs required.

Still, the incident points out that even in a
rretii protected by the First Amendment, might
I/tell makes right. We have nothing to be corn-
bicent about.

Divestment:

Are We COmmitth?

by Carol Pilgrim

0n may a, was the Board oi Trustees
passed a resolution agreeing to partial
divestment. This week the Board has
agreed to the first divestment under this
proposal.

Students on the shareholder's Respon-
sibility Committee, established under the
resolution submitted a report an eleven
companies believed to be involved in SouLh
Attica. Concerning these companies EXX'
on Corporation, Ford Motor Company, and
MGM/UK Entertainment Company.

It was decided there was not enough in
lormation an the iirst two companies to
warrant divestment at [Ills time However,
the Board agreed to divest Grinnell's cur»
rent investment of 310.840 in MGM/LIA
stock ln accordance With the proposal.
Grinnell W|Il also boycott MGM/UA lllms
starting in March.’

The decision to divest from MGM/UA

Hitting
by havid Liliellsleili

The recent declsmn of the college ad-
ministration to implement a boycott of all
Metro Goldwyn-United Artists products
will have a dlreci and immediate effect on
the Films Program at Grinnell.

Not only will many contemporary iilms
be boycotted. but more importantly, a
large number of lilm classics will not he a
part or iuture lilm programming.

From ”Apocalypse Now." “The Wall."
“The Wizard of Oz." and “Lenny." to
"Casablanca." "The Philadelpllla Story."
“To Have and Have Not," and “The
Treasure of the Sierra Madre.” the
magnitudeoilhe administration’s decision
should not be underestimated.

Presently, MGM~UA is one of the major
distributors of lilm in the United States. At
Grinnell. MGM~UA. while nnlthe mos! {res
quotitly used supplier. ranks in the top
three Recent MGMVUA films shown here
lnclude “Midnight Cowboy," “The
Maltese Falcon," “My Favorite Year.”
"The Pink Panther Strikes Again. ’ “West.
side Story," “Time Alter Time," and
"One Flew Ov'er the Cuckoo's Nest "

The central effect. of the

administration’s decision concerns the"

older classics. In 3 Lime where Lou Gerhlg

was based on a series or correspondences
between SEA students and the Compény.
In MGM/UA’s response to the initial lat»
ter. the ﬁrm stated “a partiallyowned
subsidiary of MGM/UA is the beneficiary
at a contractual prom participation in a
jointrmarkeling venture in the home video
market in South Airlca "

SEA then sent two letters asking for an
explanation oi this remark. Two months
after the tirst request a letter was received
stating MGM/UA is engaged in a merger
transaction with Turner Broadcasting
Sylem, lnc Due to the changes which
mlghl occur alter such a merger "any
response to your letter at this time would
be premature.”

The committee recommended divest-
meat based on MGM/UA's violation of the
standard set up in the Divestment Pres
pusal: ailurc to sign the Sullivan Accords,
standard used to evaluate companies in

shift‘a Africa based on equal opportunity
employment and equal pay ier equal work.
Futhermore, the committee ielg that
MGM/UA's response regarding the
partiallyowned subSIdiary was inade-
quate and deliberately avoided the request
tor more iniormation. If the merger with
Turner goes through, and the structure or
the company changes. MGM/UA will be
reevaluated,

Although itwas the Board which initially
recommended a boycott of the products of
divested companies, SEA iully suppers
the boycott ol MGM/UA tilms A boycott.

Letters to the Editor:

Dear movie review editor:

1 am sorry to inform you that your re
cent review of TIME AFTER TIME was at
fault. You said in the movie blurb that
Malcolm MacDowell was a star in the
movie THE PLANET OF THE APES, This
is in fact. incorrect, the star to which you
are referring to is Rudney MacDOWell who
also starred in CONQUEST OF THE
PLANET OF THE APES. ESCAPE FROM
THE PLANET OF THE APES, BATTLE
FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES and of
course the television Series THE PLANET
OF THE APES, Even though Malcolm
MacDowell’s work is greatly admired by
myself, the Violence CALIGULA comes to
mind, as a devout follower of RODNEY
MACDOWELL‘S work I must demand that.
a correction be printed. You also stated
that TIME AFTER TIME was the reel-
pient of academy awards, I do not recall
this happening but l do know that THE
PLANET OF THE APES got the academy

award lor best makeup Please in the
iuture be carciul to not make these same
mistakes in closing I would like to say
that 1 still have a great deal at respect tor
the newspaper as a communication
medium

Your loving devoted [an (and that of
Rodney Macoowell also), David Cox e
President of Rodney MacDowell Fan Club.
Western Hemisphere Charter.

PS. If you would like some autographed
pictures at RODNEY MACDOWELL just
drop a line and I'll get them out as soon as
possible

OK, 0Kl We'll print it! Malcom
McDowell would never even think at ap-
pearing m “Planet of the Apes."

boycott oi MGMVUA attests Woody Alleu

and Sam Pecklnpah classics.

What must be realized is that a decision
to div-est train a company does not
necessarily translate into a boycott or that
company's products, indeed. the Trustee s
d'ecismn to divest from MGM~UA did not
Currv a mandatory boycott but tell that
dec ion with the college administration.

Yet it is arguable that u boycotl is the
logical conclusion to the trustee‘s art at
divestment Certainly there are lmporlanl
ramifications of the decision to boycott,

A ball on such a large body oi American
classic ﬁlms as MlewA controls can our
ly result in a lilm program weighted heavlr
ly in the direction at contemporary film
Also. many at the classic ﬁlms are used as
academic vehicles, shown Jointly with
academic departments as supplementa-
tion to curricular programs

One wonders. albeit cynically . whether i,
boycott would have been implemented it
important textbooks were oi issue

it the ban lusts, the lilm program at
Grinnell will llol be the best possible.
Whether, in this instance. this is the price
to pay will remain open to student debate
