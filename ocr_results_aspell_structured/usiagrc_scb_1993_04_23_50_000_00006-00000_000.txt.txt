Comedian discovers improv

Grinnell alum recalls experiences from professional stand-up

by Jeremy Giltner

lNG, goes the phone. Click,
R goeslheansweringmachine.

The message goes: “...So
Erin Lynch walks into this bar With a
parrot on her shoulder. And Lhe bar-
tender says, ‘What can I get you?’
And the parrot says-"

Beep.

This is Grinnell comedian Tom
Johnson’s subtle way of telling Erin
the jokes on her own machine are
somewhat lacking. As seen at his
performance warming up for the
Raspyni Brothers at the beginning of
this semester, he often employs a
subtle, smooth sort of humor. The
laughs are spread throughout the dia-
logue instead of jumping from
punchline to punchline.

Butthen,Tomisasmooth,subtle
kind of guy. He doesn’t talk loudly,
he doesn’t move quickly, he doesn't
dress boldly, but he stays aware and
knows what he’s doing.

Tom Johnson is an '83 Grinnell
graduate, who majored in English
because Grinnell didn’t offer corn-
edy. He knew he wanted to do com—
edy since he was a sophomore at
Grinnell.

In themiddleofhisjunioryear,he
dropped out of Grinnell and started
working the comedy clubs in Minne-
apolis with his friend and fellow co-
median Larry Finder. They were a

team, and moved on from Minneapo-
lis to New York City. They worked the
clubs there for two and a half years,
and then went their separate ways.
Johnson wentto Chicago, doing
solocomedy. A friend told him about
some classes being offered in impro-
visation, and he became a student of
Del Close. Close was and still is one
of the leading figures in improvisa-
tion, and many current stars. such as
Bill Murray, have worked with him.
As he became more and more
involved in improv, he became less
interested in comedy.“1mprovis new
every time you do it, but comedy is
the same old thing,” Johnson said.
“S ome comedy
may look impro»
vised, butifyou go
to the show again,
you willseethatit‘s
all rehearsed."
Comedy and
improv formed a
conﬂict, and Johnson quit doing
stand-up in '88. He moved back to
Iowa, his home state, where many of
his friends lived. He commuted from
Ames to Grinnell every week, work
ing in Amos and spending time with
Proteus in Grinnell.

and spends a lot of time with rv.

“lmprov is new
every time you do it,
but comedy is the
same old thing."
—Tom Johnson

When Tom performed at the
Harris Center lastlanuary, he hadn‘t
done standrup for over two years. He
was asked to do a twenty-minute act,
and he wrote out half of his time that
same evening. ”Which is almost uni
heard of," Tom said. “Most comedl»
ans never do new stuff, or they'll
maybe slip in one new joke. But
usually.comcdians dothe sameshow
over and over.”

When asked how the Grinnell
audience was, he responded, “Great.
They were good.“ The best audience
is one which wants to hear the come
dian and pays attention.

Johnson’sworstaudiencewasone
attire StudentUnion at
BallStathniversityin
Indiana, where he was
forced to walk outof a
show. “I hada flat, and
I was very late. They
were laying in wait for
me." They gave John-
son such a hard time that he quit half—
way through his show “I did halfmy
Lime and then left. Surprisingly, I did
get half my money, Unsurpristngly,
my agent took his full cut.”

Johnson is definitely going to
continue doing improv, but isn't sure
about stand-up. “I‘d like todoa show
every new and then, but I won’t go
professional again. But I shouldn’t.
swear to that; I swore I'd never go to
grad school, and look what hap-
pened."
