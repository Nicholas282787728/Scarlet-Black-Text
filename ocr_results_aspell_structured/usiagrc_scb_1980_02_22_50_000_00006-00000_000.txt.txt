Polemic extends
a cultural
revolution

The Polemic was originally tor-
mulated and organized by Phil Guarco
midway through last semester as an
nutIet of the “Cultural Revolution"
which was being pushed at the time.
The editors believed certam views and
opinions weren’t. being expressed by
the existing media and that the 8&5 at
that point was an insipid newspaper.

Guarco wrote a note in the Campus
Memo about raising questions which
should be addressed; such as global,
political. educational, and the arts.
Presentlymre Polelnic is still looking
for writers. It has received much
vocal support but not as many persons
have indicated an interest in writlng.
One goal the editors would like to ac-
complish is bi-monthly publication.

The Polemic is described as a pro-
gressive journal with a serious outlook
on lts subjects, thus accomplishing
what the $518 and the 8&5 simply
can‘t do.
