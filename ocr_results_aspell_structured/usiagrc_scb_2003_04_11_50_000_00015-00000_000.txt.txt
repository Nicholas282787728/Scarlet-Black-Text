will wo k for food"

over me pasr week, i’ve logged a ler otheurs in‘ rhe
Career Development omee. l’ve broughr in resumes.
They’ve told me how rhose resunies would prevenr my
post-college employment. l’ve raken rhose resumes home
and rried ro reewrite my campus involvemenrs in such a
way rhar would not alienare Middle America.

While rhis has been an exhausting process, i rhink
l’vc learned a lor from ir and, according re rhe sralrar rhe
CDO, I'm nor rhe only college senior who’s having
trouble wriring a nonconrroversial resume, in her, when
ir comes righr down ro ir, Grinnellians aren’r rhe mosr
niarkerable breed or college srudenr. We’re a lirrle bir
rough around rhe edges, We’ve deconstructed one too
many social consrruers We’ve cast to rhe wind one too
many eulrural norms. Neverrheless, we’re jusr as quali-
ned as rhe next college graduate; we ,usr need a bit more
polishing before rhey send us our for an inrerview.

5o, rlus week, I'd like to use my column as a sorr of
resume guidebook ro address rhe special needs rhar
Grinnellians faee in rhe job search process. And, while
rhese rips mighr nor land you rhe job oryour dreams,
with any luck they'll srarr you moving in rhe righr diree.
rion.

Tip #1:When in doubt, use an acronym. While cm-
ployers like to hire people who have leadership experi.
ence, rhere are occasions when ir mighi be advanrngeous
ro emphasize rhe raer rhar you have leadership cxpcrie
enee and do your best to hide how rhar experience was
gained. For example, a rypicai Grinneliian resume mighr

‘co Leader, Coven Oletchcs, srudenr group,
Grinnell, IA organized inc worship otvarieus nature
goddesses, led incanrarions, and danced naked under rhe
rull moon."

While everyone here understands rhe presrige and
hard work involved in leading a brood ofwitchcs, your
tiiiure employerisay, for example, an invesrmenr
banker—mighr have concerns or misconceprions abour
the nature otsueh an activity. That’s
where acronyms come in! You sim-
ply change “Coven OfWitches" re
“C.O.\V’ and, poor. rhe employer’s
concerns will disappear rasrer rhan
you can easr a circle.

Uh, ohl Bur, whnrro do about rhe
eonrenr or rhar resume entry? How
can we possibly ger around that? Well,
rhar’s where Tip #2 comes in,

Tip #2: Avoidance. in rhc career

ean be imporranr ro avoid buzz Wonk

_ like “goddesses," “spells," and “na-
ked," when selling yourself ro an employer; however, if
you change a word here and adiusr a phrase rhere, you
can make even rhe mosr srigmaiired acriviry as whole»
some and American as apple pie. For example, here’s a
way rliar we could “ralk around” the aeriviries in the ex.
ample we used above.

“Organized narure appreciation evenrs, led environ-
menral poerry readings, participated in various forms of
folk dance."

Problem solved: By following this rip, you can retain
rhe essenrial message or your resume—leadership, pub.

Tip #5: Keep it concise, Anorher place rhar srudenrs
ger inre rrouble is when rheir resume becomes too wordy.
Remember, employers wanr ro skim rhrough a resume
quickly, nor ger leaded down in verbose language. For
example, insread otwriring abour your involvemenr in a
“radical queer yourh oollecrive," rry using rhe phrase

“youth group" It says essenrially the
same thing in halrrhe words!

Tip #4: use accessible language.
While everyone on campus mighr

chances are rhar rhe person reading

. Therefore, when discussing rhe sorrs

should remember to use language

insread ofwriting, “lived in Main hall for four years” or

“I have an extensive drug and alcohol history,” rry using

rhe phrase “I minored in bio-chem." once again, rhis
rip allows you re lisr rhe wonderful eredenrials rhar you’ve
amassed here ar crinnell, withour falling inro rhe rrap or

“frightening away” a porenrial employer.

Wirh any luck you'll ﬁnd rhese rips as helpful in your
