Fund for Excellence Proposal

Contacts: John Aerni ’01 and Emilie Beavers ’01

The mission ofstudent affairs, according to the college handbook, page 29, is to provide a “counseling and advising system" for the student body We believe that the elimination of the RLC position and
Director ofStudent Activities compromises this mission. In addition, this elimination jeopardizes the ability ofGrinnell to maintain a first rank counseling and support network. As stated in the memo to students
dated February 24, 1999 the core criterion for rhe Fund is to promise strategic enhancemenr ofthe College as a liberal arrs college ofthe first rank The College needs these positions to adequately manage issues
facing Grinnell students.

RLC position

The philosophy ofthe Residence Life program is to develop an effecrive supporr community within each hall that reﬂects the brad range ofstudent experiences and life in a rigorous academic environment, as
well as addressﬁng] concerns for the future" (page 50, Grinnell College handbook). The RLC work within this framework Their responsibilities include

' Advising students in academic and personal affairs

' Counseling

' Crisis control

' Adult role model on campus

By eliminating one ofthe seven RLC positions that exist on campus, the ability to maintain the current level ofsupport and personal attention for students is diminished. With more responsibilities, the ability
for RLC’s to develop personal relationships with students decreases. Without strong personal relationships between the RLC, students staff and students, the level of trust feels toward an RLC will drop, leading to
a decline in rhe supporr community the College provides.

The RLC is the preliminary level to which students turn for advice. RLC’s promote selfegovernance, the system upon which Grinnell is based. They promote learning inside and, more importantly, outside the
classroom. Students are encouraged to work thought their problems together, but know there is support available thought the RLC.

Increasing thejurisdiction ofsome RLC’s will place a greater burden on them. The RLC then must spend more time managing an increased number ofstudents, causing an overall drop in the personal attention
the College promises. North Campus has a significantly larger number ofstudents than South Campus. lfan RLC position is eliminated, there will be an equal number quLC on the two sides oframpus, causing
greater inequality between the distribution ofstudents per RLC.

Eliminating an RLC position not only diminished the support network for students, but also decreases the support network available for the RLC’s themselves in an already isolated and stressful community. The
mental health ofthe RLC’s must be taken into consideration. Despite student affairs intention to manage the increased workload, there will still be a smaller number ofon»campus staffto deal with crises as they
arise.

Director of Student Activities:

The responsibilities ofthis position include:

- Giving advice and serving as a resource for students planning programming
- Helping develop organizational and leadership skills for students

' SGA adviser

' Harris Center director

The Director ofStudent Activities position has been compared to the hub ofa wheel. This position works best when its functions are coordinated under one individual who knowledgeable about the needs
ofthe student body and policies ofstudent affairs. To provide student groups with easy, accessible answers to programmatic questions, the Director ofStudent Activities position is invaluable. It is imperative to
have a resource readily available who is familiar with college policy and the workings of rhe srudenr affairs deparrmenr. This position currently has an “open-door‘policy." By switching the responsibiliries of rhis

position to other student affairs staff, who are not as visible and also have other important roles, the ability ofstudents to receive expedient answers diminishes.
Lisa Matye, the current Director of Student Activities, has made this an initiativertaking position. She acts as the advisor to the Sexual Assault Working Group. The College loses substantially when it removes
such an enterprising position that has enhanced the campus community.
Eliminating this position would erode the theory of self-governance upon which Grinnell is built. Students are encouraged to coordinate their own activities that will enhance student life, but at the same time,
have the security ofknowing that someone is available to answer any questions that might arise. The Director ofStudent Activities is a convenient, accessible source for these answers. Without a single person to
fulfill these duties, student 5 lack the convenient resource that is currently available, making the task of attaining the quality programming and accessible advising much more difficult.

Federal medical marijuana bill proposed

BY PAYTON KNOPF ‘
(UNVIRE) BOSTON, Mass.

Federal restrictions limiting states’
ability to authorize the use ofmedical
marijuana would be eliminated under
a bill proposed rhis month by Con-
gressman Barney Frank (DeMass).

Frank's proposal would reclassify
marijuana from a Schedule I ro a
Schedule 11 drug, allowing it to be pre»
scribed by doctors under the Con—
trolled Substanccs Act in states that
permit the drug to be used as media
cine,

“What we need to do to get mari—
juana into the hands ofpeople suffer»
ing is to ser aside the federal controls
on marijuana so the states can deter»
mine the issue for themselves," Frank

said in a written statement.

The use ofmedieal marijuana has
been approved by voters in Alaska,
Arizona, California, Colorado, Ne-
vada, Oregon and Washington, but
the implementation ofsuch measures
has so far been restricted by federal law.

The House ofRepresentatives last
fall overwhelming approved a resolu-
tion sraring that marijuana was an ad-
dictive and dangerous drug that
should not be approved for medical
use. Another proposal to ease restric-
tions on medical marijuana put forth
by Frank in 1995 failed to receive
Congressional approval.

The introduction of Frank’s legis—
lation coincides with the release
Wednesday of a report by the Insti-
tute of Medicine, which found the

chemicals in marijuana can reduce
pain and nausea and help AIDS pa-
tients and people undergoing chemo-
therapy.

However, the study also warned
that marijuana can cause respiratory
disease and recommended the devel»
opmcnt ofa standardized form ofthe
drug that can be taken by inhaler.

“Parts of the survey were good;
parts of it were bad," said Keith
Stroup, general counsel for the Na-
tional Organization for the Reform of
Marijuana Laws. “Marijuana is useful
for helping the seriously ill... To make
them wait until an inhaler can be de-
veloped is absurd."

TheAmerican Medical Association
has not yet taken a position on the use

of medical marijuana, according to
spokesman Ross Frasier, who said the
group is waiting for more research into
the drug's effecriveness.

“As ofnow mere is no scientiﬁcally
based evidence of a medical use for
marijuana," Frasier said. "The evi-
dence so far is just anecdotal.”

But Harvard University Professor
Lester Grinspoon, who originally sug»
gested Frank’s legislation, argued that
many commonly prescribed drugs
such as penicillin and insulin were
approved based solely on anecdotal
evidence.

He added that 30 to 40 other
medical associations across the coune

rry have endorsed cannabis as medi- ,

“There is a wonderful mountain

audior of the book “Marijuana, the

ofcannabis use, Grinspoon said.
