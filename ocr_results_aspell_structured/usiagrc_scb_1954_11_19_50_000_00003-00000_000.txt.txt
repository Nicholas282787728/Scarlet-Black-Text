Strangers In Our Midst

by Chuck Stegmeil-

Professor number tour in this
series of faculty members is a
real toughee. His diversified inr
terests might give some hint as
to his department however.

Born at Kalamazoo, Michigan
in 1921, his early public school-
ing was in various parts or the
western section of that state.
He attended high school in
lowell, Michigan and worked,
for his father who was a funeral
director.

In 1939. he began his college
education at Grand Rapids Jun-
ior college where he spent two
years. Then he transferred to
Kalamazoo college from which
in 1943 he received his Bache-
lor of Arts degree in English.

During his undergraduate col-
lege years he worked at the
funeral home to pay his way.
but found time to be a member
of the track team, sports editor
or thi, college paper. and an.
nouoser for a college radio pro-
gram heard on a town radio
station. While attending Kalma-
zoo, it was also necessary for
him to commute do to 30 miles

Chuck Haynes, North Youn-
ker junior, will give a sum—
mary of the
Convention, activities held last
week in Columbus, Ohio, at the

SDX National _

a day from his home,

Following his graduation, he
went to the University or 111i:
nois as a teaching assistant and
earned his MA. He came to
Iowa shortly afterward and held
a research assistantship at the
University of Iowa from which
he received his PhD, in 1947.
He joined the Grinnell taculty
in January 1947 as an instrue
tor and by 1949 had advanced
to his present rank of associate
protessor.

,Married in 1947, he and his
wife, Martha, have two children,
a boy 5 and a girl 3. His two
active hobbies, gardening and
carpentry, are ordinary enough
but his other hobby, which he
cannot actively follow here, is
more unusual — archaeology.

This subject caught his at-
tention right after the war when
he spent some time in Arizona
with his parents. He recovered
some objects from-Indian ruins
to start a collection. With no
opportunity for actual excavaa
tion in Crinnell, he has kept up
on developments in the field
mainly by reading.

Author of numerous articles
for journals in his field. he is
now testing, with white rats
as subjects, some deductions
from a theory which he has
been trying to develop.

COLLEGE SMOKERS PREFER Luckies~and ‘by a wide
marginiaccording to the largest and [amt coast-to-coast
college survey. Once again, the No. 1 reason: Luckies taste
better. They taste better because Lucky Strike means ﬁne
tobacco. Then, that tobacco is toasted to taste better.
“It’s Toosted”— the famous Lucky Strike process — tones
up Luckies‘ light, good-tasting tobacco to make it taste
even better. The pleasure you‘ll get from Luckies’ better
taste is vividly depicted in the Droodle above, titled:
Modern artist enjoying Lucky While glancing in mirror.
See the ecstatic smile? Well, you, too, can be happy.
