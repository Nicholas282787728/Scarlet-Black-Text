Broaching a taboo subicct

“But if you ask [or a rise it’s no sur-
prise that they're giving none away.”
R, Waters
think you're an enlightened,
Ive-minded liberal arts stu-
dent? You're opcnrminded and well
read and up-todate‘! Well, lam going
to shock and disgust you. At a campus
that can accept abortion, acid, and
anarchy as readily, perhaps more so,
than Mom and apple pie, I'm going to
broach the one taboo subicct: money,

I must confess to a little [car in this.
No doubt I've already been branded a
greedy capitalist by the mere mention
oi the word. But, be that as it may,
my purpose here is not to deiend the
making or money but to explore the
values that the desire [or money is
based on.

It's a subject we should consider. In
Grinnell. it is rejected out of hand.
The desire for money is a base, crude,
and unenlighened animalistic passion,
‘l'hat‘s all right for us but the Hist of
the world may disagree. A recent poll
by the American Council on Education
and the University of California
revealed that 56.7% of freshman
women and 69.1% of freshman men
now consider being “very well on
financially” as “an essential or very
important objective." That‘s up from
32.1% and 54 1% respectively in 1959.

[don’t suppose that that comes as
any great surprise to anyone, The
traditional upper classman complaint
has been that the freshman class is
every year more conservative, more
career-oriented, more greedy. The
fact that 59.2% of this woman and
68.9% of the men cited “make more
money" as a “very important” reason
ior‘going to college would seem to
bear this out.

However, that doesn't trouble me as
much as the fact that “develop a
philosophy oi life” was considered an
essential or very important objective
by 31% iewer women and 27% fewer
men against the same group of ten
years ago. It would appear that we've
given up on trying to give our lives
any more coheranco than that which
gets us from payday to payday.

No. , . 1 take that back. There are a
number of values that the American
people hold dear. The problem is that
they've become externalized to the
point where, not only can’t we be hap»
py unless we own x, y, and 2, but
John Smith and Mary Jones have to

unsatisiying existence. .
Notice I’m not arguing against

We’ve conquered everything , that is, except

ourselves. Our own existence and our

place in the world is still baffling to us.

 

be happy {or us (or ycdlous of us), too,
What we think of our lives has become
less important than what others think

and money is just another status sym-
bol.

The “American dream” is no longer
to start with nothing and build respecr
table'life but to spin»oli from an
established sit-com, pull a twenty
share in prime time, guest host the
Tonite show, sell your poster to a
million iiyear olds, and have your
greatest hits ship gold. See and be
seen has become the golden rule.

What I’d like to suggest is a little
diversification because this kind of
“watchme” economy can't go on
forever. Unless we ﬁnd something
other than Gucci shoes to give mean-
ing to our existence we’re gotng to end
up with a lot of unhappy people. We've
entered the Age of Limits and the
days of the no-growth economy. The
ncw'irontier has gone the way oi the
space program—no more oceans to
discover, no more continents to ex-
plore,

We've conquered everything, that is,
except ourselves. Our own existence
and our place in the world is still bai~
lung to us, How many times this
winter have you asked yourself.
”What am i doing here and why am i
doing this?" These are questions that
have to have some kind of answer
before you go out and try to be “very
well off financially." Let's treat the
disease and not the symptoms. Money

CISSiSts, let's at least be prudent nar- -
cissists, A very good case can be '
made for serious introspection on a ‘
purely seliish basis. who hasn’t been
aghast at the job prospects for Liberal.
Arts students? It seems as it we enter
the world with two strikes against us“ ‘
I believe, however, that the Coherent -
and thoughtful way of dealing with , 2
your life, the “philosophy of life” that
a liberal arts education can provide, . ,

more than makes un_ for it, ,
A “philosophy oi lite" can give

‘ stability to life outside ot the fluctua-

tions or the stock market. It’s time we
stop putting our iaith in the almighty .
buck and invest a little in ourselves. If_
we can give personal and emotional ,
triumphs as much prestige as Porches
and designer jeans every _

psychoanalyst in the country would go_
out of business. We need to turn _
ourselves into complete and function- .
ing human beings instead oterecting}

But it we can‘t continue to place a. _
monetary value on our lives, neither
can we continue to check the ,
“undecided" box in the form that asks
us what we really believe. It’s not . ‘
without reason that we've lost cons
iidence in everything from governs , ,
ment to God, but unless we find out
what we actually do believe in, and
start acting on it, we might as well
live our lives by proxy. Cynicismjs
fine up to a point, but it doesn’t get .
much done. what I‘m advocating is an
aggressive search for value outside of
political, theological, or corporate , _
deology and inside every individual.
what do you really believe?

Maybe all this goes without saying.
viaybe that’s why we're here.
Perhaps, in Grinnell, we'all realize
that the value of a liberal arts educa-
tion lies not in the 8 hours a day we're’
at work, but the 16 hours a day we’re
not Then again, I'm told that this
year's freshman class participated in
the above survey. Maybe we‘re not‘as‘
enlightened as we like to think.
