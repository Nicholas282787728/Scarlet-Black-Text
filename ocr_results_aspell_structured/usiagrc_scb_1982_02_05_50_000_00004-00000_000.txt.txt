It was only the first week of classes We had just returned from five
weeks of relaxation and should have been rested, mentally and
physically. But it happened. And it started early Yes, after only one
week of classes, Grinnell students were already going beserk.

It began with the International Studies Food Bazaar, where students
fueled themselves for a crazy night. They next ventured to North
Lounge to escalate their rowdiness with the Tony Brown Band, But
they brought the night to a climaxwith the debacle at the Rocky Horror
Picture Show (see story on page 2)

Yes, the night was filled with fun events. But why does our fun have
to turn violent? As Dean of Student Affairs Jim Tederman reported at
Monday’s faculty meeting, the damage on campus is increasing and
exterior doors and windows are most victimized. For instance, a
Forum PDR window was broken Saturday night and BM} spent nine
hours cleaning ARI-i auditorium after each performance of Rocky Hor-
ror. Plus, at least $4,000 will be needed to replace the ARH screen.

It is disturbing to realize who this violence is hurting. Almough
townspeople also participated in the events, the Grinnell students are
the ones who will suffer 7 because the money to repair such damage
comes out of the SGA budget.

But the most troubling aspect of the night is the apparent desire to be
destructive, Did we already feel pressure? Was Rocky Horror just an
excuse to let out our frustrations? Or are we only able to work and play
at extremes?

If the cause of such violent weekend releases is the academic tension
at Grinnell, then the faculty and adminsitration must be made aware
of it. If students just can’t help but go overboard'while having fun,
future SGA social coordinators, films and concerts chairpersons and
Performing Programs and Activities Counselor Georgia Dentel will
need to watch social bookings more carefully. And if students are
unable to have anything but a wild time, then let’s all step back for a
minute, take a deep breath, calm down and enjoy ourselves this
weekend 7 rationally.

DWBSI i0 maintain
Grinnell's morals

With this weekend’s Board of Trustees meeting comes the inevitable
discussion of Grinnell’s role as an investor in corporations which
operate in the apartheid-practicing nation of South Africa, Also,
perhaps, a decision will finally be made concerning the fate of the col—
lege’s stock invested there To divest or not to divest'.7 That is still the
question 7 and we hope the former will be the answer,

Figures showing the involvement of US. corporations in the finances
and policies of South Africa and Grinnell’s effect, specifically, are im-
portant to know in resolving this argument but are merely superfluous
details when we look at the basic issue: The South African government
supresses and discriminates against the 80 percent of its citizens who
are black. US. companies that do business there are supporting the
economy this government runs. And by placing its money with these
companies, Grinnell is expressing its approval of the South African
government 5 policies.

Certainly, this question concerns money, because the college’s
finances are involved. But it is also a question of morals, And, as Dan
Magurshak, assistant professor of philosophy, wrote in the November-
December issue of the Grinnell Magazine, “The faculty, administra-
tion, students and trustees should not deceive themselves with the
myth that Grinnell College is or ought to be ethically neutral as an in-
stitutioni”

The campus community is exposed to political and moral issues con-
tinually, through, for example, Scholars’ Convocations such as the talk
by exiled South African journalist Dumisani Kumalo last year. The ,
Rosenfield Public Affairs Program also makes the community aware
of its social obligations. But to maintain our support of apartheid is to
compromise Grinnell’s ideals, for instance, the third goal stated in the
catalogs “Purpose of the College" section. This section includes, “1 . .
the liberally educated person is one who fulfills social responsibilities .

. . ." It is not socially responsible to ignore the rights of any person,
much less the rights of an 80 percent minority in South Africa.

The South African Support Group recognizes its obligation to fellow
people and will be holding a demonstration Saturday at 1 p.m. on the
West Terrace of the Forum. Student protests seem to be out of vogue in
the ‘805 but the trustees need to see that divestment is supported by
Grinnellians with social consciences.

President George Drake reported Monday at the faculty meeting
that those trustees involved in business are “very, very nervous”
about finances and from his statement it can be expected that the
board will not want to pull out any investments in the near future. But
this is not really a question of money. It‘s a question of Grinnell‘s
morals — not just the personal ethics of each community member but
of the institution itself.

From the editor

Besides beginning a new semester with

trying out a new type of organization
Beginning this week News staff only
