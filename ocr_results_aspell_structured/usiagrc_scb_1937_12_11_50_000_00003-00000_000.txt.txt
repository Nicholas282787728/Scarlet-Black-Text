Lecturers Stress Import-
ance of Graduate Work
in Major Fields.

Speakers for the vocations
class Friday afternoon emphasized
the necessity of graduate work
in the fields of science and medi»
cine, law and business, and edu—
cation and general graduate work.

Chester Phillips, dean of the
college of commerce at the state
University of Iowa was unable
to appear. He was to speak in
the section on law and business

Dr. A. R. Brobyn, local physi-
cian, said, in his talk on medicine,
that the profession is “no bed of
roses,” and that no person entel'~
ing the profession should expect
to make a fortune. He outlined
the courses necessary, expenses.
and stages of work,

Speaking on graduate work in
science, in the section on media
ciLe and science, J. Alfred Adams,
instructor in zoology, explained
that the graduate work is no
more exhausting because there
are no extracurricular activities.
Adams also stated that, although
graduate school is expensive, fel»
lowships and scholarships can be
obtained with honor grades.

According to Rupert A. Hawk,
superintendent of Grinnell public
schools, lawyer and accountant,
there are more men certified pub»
llc accountants than women. He
emphasized the value of graduate
work in accounting and business,
and said that women are better in
general business.

Frances Tomasek, lawyer, ex~
plained the requirements for the
study of law, ways of getting
into the practicing of law, the
problem of location, and how to
be a success.

To become an efficient gradus
ate, said Paul Spencer Wood, pro-
fessor of English. when speaking
in the section of general graduate
work, is to be able to discriminate
between what are primary facts
and what are not. He also stated
that scholarships are given for
good academic records, early ap-
plications, strong reconunenda—
tions, and fulfillment of the
language requirements.

L. Wendell Hayes, instructor in
economics and political science, in
speaking in the same section, out—
lined the difference between
graduate and undergraduate work.
and explained the expenses of
graduate study,

The next meeting of the voca-
tions class will he after the
Christmas holidays, it will be

Pioneers Whip C02, 38-
31, in First Home Game

The Pioneer cagcl-s won their
first home game of the season
here last night, when they downed
Forrest. thtgers’ Coe five by a
38731 score in a rugged, ragged
game. - It was the second game
of the year for the Grinnell
squad.

It was obvious from the outset
that the Pioneers were the sue
perior team. and that they were
not working very hard. As a re-
sult, after a dingrdong battle
early in the game, Coe forged
into a founpomt lead, 1177, which
it held for quite some little time.

Contest Turns.

The tide of the contest turned,
however, when Fred Luther was
substituted at forward, with Coe
leading 15-11. Berry dropped in
a long one, Luther scored

Pioneers ahead 19715. Coe came
up again, and at half time the
Plonecrs had managed to hold on
to a 22720 lead.

After half time
play smoothed out considerably,
and tlic Scarlet and Black team

were never in too serious trouble.

McKinley liohaivlr Leader.

McKinley, with seven free
throws and two baskets led the
scoring for the Kohawks, but the
spal'kplug of the cue attack was
Bazos. a cocky little guard who
also managed to accumulate six
points on long shots.

The Pioneers were far from
being at the top of their form.
but managed to enter into the
rough—andtumble spirit of the
game enough to win. Freddy
Luther, with 11 points, was high
scorer and was mighty effective
when he was in the game. Hal
Dean was next in the scoring
column with nine points, andW

bur Lulck, who warmed up after
a very slow start, got eight
points, six of them in the second
half. LaMasney, Berry and Cons
will, although not figuring heavir
