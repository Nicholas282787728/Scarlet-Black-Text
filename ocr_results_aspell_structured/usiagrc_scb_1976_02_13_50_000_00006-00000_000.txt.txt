Revamping) and
interest needed

Committee after committeeithose wonderful democratic
institutions by which we all govern Grinnell, right? Take a
closer look.

Committees at Grinnell suffer from ill-defined functions
and operating procedures as well as overlapping jurisdic-
tions. Members of Student Services subcommittees are
unclear as to what exactly they should and can do. The
Curriculum Council cannot be effective because the
Executive Council makes personnel decisions directly ef-
fecting the curriculum.

Certain student committees merely rubber stamp ad-
ministration proposals, A counseling committee member
admitted that the committee essentially OKs administrative
proposals as the students don’t have the knowledge 'of the
administrative personnel.

Then there are the committees that don’t meet. The
Health Services sub-committee met twice last semester. Is
health something that we don’t need to worry about'.7 Even if
committees met, many met on an irregular basis off in some
corner of the campus where their discussion would be lost
forever.

And who knows what committees there are and when they
are meeting and what they are discussing? They are the
governing bodies on campus and yet very few know or care
what they are doing.

Student committee members are selected to represent the
general student body. However, it is rather difficult to
represent people who don’t express opinions and don't seem
to care. Students abdicate their power by refusing to par-
ticipate, not finding out what’s going on and not holding
committee members responsible for their actions.

Along with the ineffectiveness of each individual com-
mittee, the structure as a whole has failed to perform
adequately. Committee members don't know where to take
their recommendations and proposals. The Committee on
Social Policies and Regulations is instructed to initiate, and
recommend to the president “such changes as it deemed
appropriate in allrcollege social policiies and regulations.”
Yet, when members are asked what SP&R has done, they
reply that the Ad Hoc Committee on Housing is its sub-
committee Yeah, but what about SP&R itself?

Obviously, the committee systems at Grinnell suffer from
serious deficiencies Many involved in the system agree that
restructuring and redefining needs to go on. It certainly
does. However, such measures must be discussed and un-
dertaken by a large crosssection of people. To work, a new or
revised system requires interest and concern on the part of
the entire college community.

To give you a better idea of my
habit I have recently perused my
favorite wall in Burling for your
benefit. Morn, the lists are fans
tastic: Best Dressed Dogs on
Campus, Best Profs, Twenty
Angry Women, Who Could Forget?
(“sign out your lasagna for dead

course, Ten Best Fantasties
(“Making it on a bed of nails with

Mom.

Basically, the reason I go down
so often is to keep up with all the
witty conversations and ex-
changes. To wit:

“It's getting dark in here. Why
don't they replace the light bulbs?”

“The bulbs have nothing to do
with it—it's the downfall and
darkening of society.”

“Society has nothing to do with

I first began to wonder about
myself when I voluntarily started
trekking across campus to “study"
at the library. Soon I was going
down to the bathroom three and
four times an hour, When I found
myself going down solely for the
purpose of reading the walls, and
not to do my “duty" at all, I knew I
had passed that critical point, I
was hooked. In due time I was
sneaking in for a hit, standing
locked in a stall, attempting to
muffle my giggles of glee, flushing
the toilet periodically.

A quick and certain way for
anyone to have a book published is
for him or her to collect a large
number of lettEIS of his or her
favorite writer. The resultant tone
should demonstrate the growth of
the writer sexually, artistically,
and politically (in that order) and
must be published after that
writer’s death, James Joyce,
Sylvia Plath, John Steinbeck, and
Virginia Woolf have recently been
subjects of this approach to
biography.

the life of the artist is left up to the

that person's death strikes me as
being an undue invasion of
privacy.

years and fully reflects my
development (what little there has
been). I wish this week to present
some selections from the section of

“No, the answer is one square

Dear Mr. Nichols,

I just returned from a private
screening of your film “Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf,” and
although I feel you and the actors
did a credible job, I feel I must
protest the contentof the film. How
much longer do you think the
movie-going public is going to
stand for this saccharine, Sound-oi-
Musicesque tripe thatyou and your
. cohorts are foisting on -them, Mr.

“I love Fred and he loves me.”

“So what?"

“It makes a difference to me!"

“And, we may presume, to
Fred.”

Of course, aside from these lists,
categories, and dialogues, there
are those wonderful little insights,
so characteristic of Grinnellians,
scattered throughout the wall
scribbling. For example: “You are
paranoid about feminism,”
“Feelings don‘t play by the rules,"
“It’s a sexist world, baby.” Most
noticeable are the laments about
boyfriends past and present
(laments about girlfriends past
and present are generally confined
to the west “Sappho lives” wall),
as well as pleas for advice, “How
do I seduce a quantitative
historian7H “How do I seduce a
jocko’.’" (“Who wants to seduce a
jocko?").

Gossip has a big role too, but
most of it is unflt for a mother’s
cars (including a discussion about
mothers) except for the line
“Strauber walks on water."
Prominent also are the exhorr
tations: “Remember Mrs.
Evans ." and “Give lowa back to
the lowlsh .”

Recently I have begun making
furtive forays into the bathrooms
in the Forum and Gardner Lounge,
but none rival the crystalline
beauty of Burling of course I
haven't ventured into the men’s.
That's fairly hard-core stuff, Mom,
real heavy-duty highs.

I'm very happy now, spending
six or seven hours a day at the
library, feeding my habit as
discreetly as possible. I only hope
you and Dad can understand that
this is the way I am now.

Please send money,
daughter.

Nichols? What the public wants
today is candor, truth, and
realityma meaning to their films.
It is your job, Mr. Nichols, as a
director to provide them with that
truth and meanin .

While I complain bitterly, I feel
that the public can invest their
artistic trust in you more than any
other director. So I have come up
witha basic idea for your next film
which I feel will satisfy the needs
and desires of the public. A story of
a college graduate, on his own in
the real world, who falls in love
with a beautiful girl but gets
trapped in an affair with her
mother. Spicy stuff, I know, but
you can handle it. Be sure to punch
it up with some relevant social
commentary, and also try to get
Bob Dylan or the Byrds or some
other folkrroCk people to do the
score I hope these suggestions
prove to be of use to you.

Sincerely, Jeffrey Miller

(Mr. Nichols is, of course, director
Mlke Nichols, He replied to the
. author: “Dear Mr. Miller: I have
one word for you. Just one word.
Thanks...”)v , V I:
