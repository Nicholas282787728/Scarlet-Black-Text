More college monies available

A missing link exlsls m the us. bet-
ween available college scholarships,
grants and tinanciul aid, and the people
eligible to receive them,

“Money is going unclaimed, because
people don't imoii vihere to iiiid the
l’unds, or they think they don't qualify,'
said the Director at the Student
Assistance Council 01 America,

According to Robert Freede, author
ol L'ssh-t’or-t'oiiegc lPl‘entiCe'Halll,
"People believe the myth that all
scholarships and grants are based only
on a student's llnanmal need . . . Class
standing . or test scores. it's not
true."

“More than $100 million o| school aid
has gone unclaimed and unused
because it has not been matched up
viith the proper students. Students don't
bother to apply because many parents
don't believe their children quality tor
financial aid,' Freede said.

Yet millions of dollars in aid are
available to people regardless ol need
or academic excellence. Total dollars
available to students for college are
some $500 million, "Substantial
amounts of money ai‘ hidden behind
strange eligibility requirements, little-
known trust lunds, public and private
grants,” said Freede.

“Since you must apply to be con-
sidered, the trick is to find out about
these iunds. Matching scholarship
