Mllth to his own otprest-d regret as
well as to that or the College authori-
ties, Senator w. S, Rem-on, who was
to time delivered the college torn-
ment, iiieiil address on Wednesday,
lune H, has been compelled to cancel
his eiietgenrent.

The reasons tor this action are two
i'old. Thur“ is the tart that the date
or the vote in torisrcss on the constitu-
tiorioi amendment legt’lrtling the popu-
lur election or tiriiicd States- senators
has been set tor lime and Senator
Kenyon roots that it i -
him to be in \Vashiueton a: that time.
The second reason is that ilrs. new
you, who recently underwent .t sci-ions
operation in New Orleans t.r- throat
trouble, is to undeigoanotrer about
lllC some data as the Grinnelr Com-
mencement. With these two contiu»
gorilies ahead, Senator Kenyon was
torted to write his regrets tiiiit he
could not lteep liis engagement here.
