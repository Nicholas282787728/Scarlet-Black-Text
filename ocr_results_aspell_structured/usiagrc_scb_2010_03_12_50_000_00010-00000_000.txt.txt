Rivalry loss rUins Saturday afternoon

A few weeks ago I received what seemed to be a fairly
innocuous invitation to a fan page called “T BET MIZ-
ZOU CAN FIND 100,000 FANS BEFORE KU CAN!”
from a friend attending the University of Missouri back
in my hometown Columbia. Thoroughly imbued with loe
cal pride, I conﬁrmed and asserted Mizzou's Facebook
supremacy in basketball over our (and I will continue to
use the ﬁrst»person plural despite my total lack ofinvolve-
merit) abhorred rival, the “University" ofKansas. Fans from
both teams traded barbs on the pages, with such witty,
gayvbashing repartee as “MIZ—GAY,”or “MU could
beat GAYU any day so sux it GAYU," dominating
the discourse. It sucked to be reminded that a
lot of people on the Internet are homophobic
neanderthals, and I’ll admit I let the semi-lit-
erate, bigoted and frequently nonsensical trash-
talking get to me. i had a visceral reaction to
reading KU fans' baseless insults defaming the L.
land of my birth (and those of such luminaries
as Edwin Hubble, Walt Disney, Maya Angelou,

Tech N9ne, Walter Cronkite, etc.) as an incesuk

ous, slavery—loving meth den. It was also hard

to see fellow Missourians take part in the hate,

especially in the wake of a bias-motivated

incident at Mrzzou’s Black Cultural

center, though, sadly, it wasn't ver
surprising. our page got 100,000 fans
before Kansas’s, but I knew the only
possible catharsis would come from a

victory not on the prestigious Internet, but indeed in the
actual physical world. *

That victory, as you may know, never came. March 6,
2010’s Border Showdown in Columbia, the second clash
this season between the rivals,was the Tigers’chance at real
redemption, and they blew it in spectacular fashion. After
keeping the game close and even leading early, the Tigers
gave up a 1670 run to KU that put the halftime score at
KU 40, MU 24. Mizzou closed to within five points mid—
way through the second half, but that was the closest we

got. Halfrdazed, I stuck out the game until its excruciating
final seconds. Final score: KU 77, MU 56. Ouch. A la Bill
Simmons, I disgustedly threw offmy Mizzou Basketball tr
shirt, taking minimal solace in that fact that itwas at least 2
more private humiliation than my Tigers had just endured.
I felt like Levi Johnston at Bristol's baby shower—hope-
lessly trapped in a frothing pit of despair and hardship for
all eternity. And knowing that on Facebook nearly 100,000
people all joyfully sneered at me only made it worse. I’ll
be honest with you, lone remaining reader—1 had hit rock
bottom. I was Nixon getting onto Air Force One for
the last time. I was Kenny Powers walking into
Jefferson Davis Middle School. I was my friend

who pooed his pants at school in 9th grade.
But shining through the clouds of despair
came a great ray ofhope, and,it came to me in
the following phrase: Sideways Canada. Kanr
sas is Missouri's Great White North (0 the
west. Basketball is to Kansans what hockey is

to Canadiansithey've got nothing else. Kans-

sas (the basketball team) is awesome, but Kansas
(the place) is deﬁned by suffocating austerity and
questionable politics (Senator Sam Brownback

introduced the HumansAnimal Hybrid Pre-
vention Act of2009,which is officially
my favorite title {or an act since the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff). If KU cvcr ens
dured prolonged futility in basketball,
the state would rise to Montana»csque
heights ofentertainment dearth. Kansas has no major pro-
fessional teams (other than the Jayhawksl just kidding.
Except Xavier Henry.) The two largest cities in Kansas
combine to have a population ofbarely more than the Des
Moines metropolitan area.I can understand why they need
to brag so much even though the program is still riding
accomplishments from the 1920s. In this new light, 1 can
almost bring myself to forgive the arrogance. To be sure,
today‘s Jayhawks, to steal Molly lvins‘s classic George w.
Bush jab, were born on third and thought they hit a triple.

But rhey need it more than Missourians.

That, my friends, is why I am kind-of proud to an-
nounce my pick for the 2010 NCAA Tournament Chains
pion, the Kansas Jayhawks. Clearly the best team in the
nation from top to bottom,l think the Jayhawks have what
it takes to take home another title. They’re dominant in-
side with c Cole Adrich averaging 11 points, 10 rebounds,
and nearly four blocks per game. Senior G Sherron Collins
provides the team's emotional spark (in the faux way that
ii Redick always used to, if you ask me). He also leads
the team in scoring with 15 ppg, which isn't eye»popping,
but that’s just because everybody scores for KU. The of»
fensive balance the Jayhawks have shown is what makes
ine so conﬁdent in their tournament chances. If Collins is
off, F Xavier Henry can step in and make buckets. Henry’s
too busy talking to his agent? Then F Marcus Morris or
G Tyshawn Taylor can fill it up. Kansas is impossible to
defend because every player on the floor can make you
pay if your defense isn’t ﬂawless. I reckon the title game
will pit the ‘hawks against the orangemen of syracuse,
another team with very few weak spots. The orange also
feature a balanced attack, but their frontcourt is too thin
to defend the likes ofAldrich. Forwards Arinze Onuaku or
Rick Jackson will get into foul trouble, forcing coach Jim
Boeheim to rely on seldomsused freshman Dashonte Riley
inside. Game, set, matchianother banner for the Eeakers
to brag about.

My other (less obvious) teams to look out for as potenT
tial contenders in March Madness are, in no particular or-
der, West Virginia, New Mexico, Georgetown, Kansas St.,
Wisconsin, Tennessee and Villanova. Each team has dems
onstrated at some point this season that they can compete
with, and sometimes beat, the very best competition. My
very preliminary Cinderella pick is red—hot North Texas.
The Mean Green just wrapped up the sun Belt Confer»
ence title in their 11th straight W. Besides, if there were
one place in the country that is worse than Kansas, it would
have to be North Texas.

Softball Settles down with new coach

Br CASEY STRICKLER

As the snow slowly melts in Iowa the
Grinnell Softball Team gears up to head to
Florida. Their annual spring Break. trains
ing trip to warmth will host their first 8
games of the season.The team can’t wait to
get on a real field.

“We’re all counting down the days to
Florida,” outﬁelder Hannah LaFollette ’11
said.

LaFollette is headed to Florida with
a new Head Coach, Craig Arendt—her
fourth in three years. The inconsistency in
the head coach‘s position means the women
have learned to rely each other.

“There’s a lot of internal critiquing and
everybody‘s helping," LaFollettc said.

Arendt stepped into the head coaching
position when last year’s coach, Suzanne
Scheef. left due to unspecified difﬁculties
with the administration. Schecf was hired
lasr fall to replace Coach Tom Sonmchson.
Primarily the women’s volleyball coach,
Sonnichson took over the head coach
ing position from interim coach .rndra
Faulkner who left in 2008, as planned, after

her ﬁrst season.

Now that they have the reliable Arendt,
the team is hopeful.

“We deﬁnitely have a lot of individual
talent and I think Coach Craig will be able
to capitalize on that," Catcher julia Reese
'10 said.

Arendt undoubtedly has the experience
needed to take over the program—he’s
coached over a decade of youth and high
school fast pitch softball and has played
himself for 18 years. He has also been
the Grinnell College assistant coach for
the past two years and has been constant
moral support for the team. Captain Kelsey
Montgomery ’11 is excited to see him step
up to the plate as head coach.

“Coach Arendt has been with our team
for all of our transitions through the last
few years Instead of having to get used to
our team and the way we work. he already
knows us,"Montgomery wrote in an ermilll.

Arendt also expressed his excircmcnt
about leading the team this ycar.

“This is the most dedicated team [I've
seen] so for at Grinncll,"Arcndt said.

Despite their small rosterilZ players
have to field nine positions—-Arendt bee
lieves that they can achieve great heights.
His goal for the season is to make the
Conference Championship Tournament.
This would mean finishing in the top
two spots for the Midwest Conference
South division. Last year the team finished
fourth.

Montgomery believes that the team has
the talent to prevail.

“We are returning a core group ofeight
players that have seen substantial time on
the ﬁeld in college competition," Mont»
gomery wrote in an e-mail. “we are also
returning three all-conference players."

Arendt identifies firstsyear pitcher
Hannah Bauman as being a key compor
nenr to the team’s success this year. Last
year they graduated their impressive starra
ing pitcher,Tcss Cohen'09,who pitched 22
of theil 31 games.The lack ofa longeterm
coaching solution has resulted in a lack of
depth in critical positions this season. As
the only player with preacollegmt softball

difficulties of being the one main player in'
a strenuous position.

“[Bauman] is going to end up carrying
a lot ofthe pitching role on her shoulders,"
Reese said. ,

Arendt and Reese agree the overall lack
of depth is directly attributable to inconsiss
tent coaching over the past four years.

“One of the big problems with not hav-
ing a stable coaching structure is that we
don't really have recruiting," Reese said.

However, Reese has hope for future
teams. Despite a rough four years this sea
son might be turning point in Grinnell
softball

“I think the athletic department hopes
fully now sees that they can’t continue to
neglect softball the way that softball has
been [neglected in the past four years],"
Reese said,

Despite all of their coaching and roster
issues, the players remain positive.

“The adversity that wc have gone
through has only brought us closer together
as a team," Montgomery stud
