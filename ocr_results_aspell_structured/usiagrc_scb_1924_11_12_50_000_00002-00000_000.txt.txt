"luDEMOISELLE MIDNIGHT."

With langunrous and beanﬁful
Mexico as 5!, background and a thrill~
ing story of love and intrigue set
in it like a. jewel, Mae Murray is said
to have the best role of her career in
“Mademoiselle Midnight," her latest
picture which is at the Strand tonight,

In “Mademoiselle Midnight" Miss
Murray plays two character roles—
that of a French lady in the court of
Napoleon III, and that or e daugh-
ter of Mexico, a senorlta famed for
beauty, wealth and cleverness.

The story is about a girl who is
attiicted with a curious midnight mad—
ness, which comes at unexpected mu»
meats. Renee de Qulros is the shel—
tered daughter at Don Pedro de
Qulros, who owns a vast cattle ranch

BERRY AGAIN SEEN AS “m9 _

Acclaimed by the nation tor a torm—
er remarkable characterization of the
same role, Wallace Beery was chosen
to renew his portrayal or King
Richard in "Richard, the Lion—Heart-
ed," a. romance 0: the Third Crusade
based on Sir Walter Scott's immortal
novel, “The ’l‘llllslllun." The new
lieery'poi 'zlyul of King; Richard will
be seen Tonight and Thursday at the
Colonial theatre. ,

The Associated Authors, combin-
ing that remarkable literary trio,
Frank E. Woods, Elmer Harris and
Thompson Buchanan, decided that
Wallace Beery was the ono’man to
play the stellar role in "Richard, the
Lion-Hearted." His appearance as
iard was considered essen-
tial to the production or this ~se—
quel“ to Douglas Fairbanks in “Robin
Hood,” on a stupendous scale that so-
curately reliects the famous historical
period of the Third Crusade. Anti so
the precedent was established of hav-
ing the same man cast in the same
role in two pictures.

With the widespread interest in
"Robin Hood" and countrywide recog~
nition of Beery’s triumph as King
Richard to count upon, the Associat-
ed Authors felt assured that "Richard,

place in screen history.

points of entertainment, of human interest, of histoiical Worth, of citizenship-

I refer to the Al and Ray Rockett production of ABRAHAM LINCOLN, a. true
story based on the life history of the martyred president, but yet so full of
action, so effervescing with humor, so ﬁlled with heart interest that. from merely

the standpoint of entertainment value, it deserves and will

ABRAHAM LINCOLN has won the highest praise from mines that I have
ever read. I have-never before seen such unanimity. And that the critics were

right has been proved: by the broken records in every city.

I want to add my

very strongest personal endorsement to all of this praise. I want every student,
man and woman who can possibly reach the Strand Theater to see it.

Especially do I desire to appeal to any who may have reached the conclusion
that the motion picture does not present the highest standard of entertainment.

This beautifully fanciful story was born of a poet’s
dream in Araby and made into an entrancing reality
by Douglas Fairbanks. It breathes the spirit of
imaginary worlds, where the unusual is usual. the
impossible is possible, and Romance and Adventure
are Life, Itself. You will see The Thief ﬂy through
the Clouds on a Magic Carpet, soar past the moon
on a Winged Horse, and out of the ground.
