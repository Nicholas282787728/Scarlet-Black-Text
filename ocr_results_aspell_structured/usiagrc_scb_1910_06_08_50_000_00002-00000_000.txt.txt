COLLEGE CHARACTER

The iliglier Education Asst) itinn,
that was tormed in idotl. untlcr ads
rice or the Amer" an Association tor
the Advancement ot Science, I s made
its ﬁrst icpoit it points oitt that
until loss than a hunrlied yeais ago—
in tact [All about 1818 or 1350, our w].
leges were conducted with special rer
ereiite to a combined moral and mental
grouth. The laws 01 Yale as well as
most of the other colleges bore upon
moral conduct instead 01 classroom
niarlring. Moral character was oer
mauded everywhere. and steps uerc
taken to secure it, At Yale every
candidate signed this agreement, "Oh
condition or being admitted as a stir
dent ot Yale College, 1 promise on my
faith and honor that I uill avoid using
prot’ane language, and all indecent. dis-
orderly beharior," and there \ some-
thing more or the same nature. The
modern catalog dirt‘ers train the old
catalog in heing a treatise on marks
and the marlring system. Each stu-
dent is allowed a certain number or
cuts and thinks, but if he oversteps the
number generously allowed him, he is
in danger of expulsion. The committee
complains in its repoit that the college
of today, in ar ring at diploma val-
ires, neglects entirely the community
and home planes ot etlriratiou, and the
fact that the young man is being traiir
ed for citizenship:

"The American colleges have net-d-
]essly abandoned organic connection
With the home and couiiuuuitv, and
concentrated their otticinl noticc upon
classroom “ark."
