Brown: Cornell Has ‘Fight, Hustle’
Plenty of Good Aggressive Football

If the Pioneers can make it four in a row against Cornell to-
morrow they will hde put together Gi-inncll's longest winning
- in since the Scarlet and Black entered the Conference back in

However, the Pioneers will have to knock over a Cornell
eleven rated by Coach Brown as one of the hardest hitting teams
his club had to face to date. “They’ve got plenty of fight.
plenty of hustle, and above all plenty of good aggressive football,"
cautioned Brown.

Although the Pioneers scored
three more touchdowns than
Cornell did in defeating Coe, the
Rams gave Lawrence, current
conierenee leaders, one of its
closest lights of the gridiron
campaign. Unbeaten Lawrence
collected only two touchdowns
all alter-noon against the Purple,
having to score their last one in
the final so seconds of the game.

Grinnell, on the basis of this
Year's record alone, will be a
heavy favorite. Offensivcly, the
Pioneers have reeled off 33 first
downs to amass a threeganie
total of 324 yards rushing, a
creditable performance in any
league. During its last three
games Grinncll's defensive

eleven has held the opposition to
a meager 303 yards on the
ground, In fact, the Scarlet and
Black has aver-aged four tallies
per game for the last three
games while the opposition has
garnered only one per contest

The Pioneers' ie time record
against the Purple is 24 wins,
13 losses and two ties, Even the
