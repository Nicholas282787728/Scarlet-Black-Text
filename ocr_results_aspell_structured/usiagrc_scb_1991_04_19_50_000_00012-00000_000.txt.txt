Women tracksters host
Delong Invitational

By Doug Hodurn

Lastwcckend the women’s track
team was to participate in the suite
meet. Due to the foul weather the
meet was canceled, leaving the team
all dressed up with no place to go.
Fortunately,CoeCollegeassembled
a group of five schools that could
compete in a meet. According to
Coach Evelyn Freeman, this was a
“low key meet” between Coe, Cor-
nell. Loras, St. Ambrose. and the
Grinnell team. However. Grinnell
had only nine women compete, as
many ofthe athletes decided to take
advantage of an unexpected break
in their schedule.

Despite having only nine ath-
letes competing, there were still a
few performances that were worth
mentioning. Three runners in the
800M event had personal bests.
Shannon Swanstrom finished bee
fore Anne Hollister and Susan Tho-
mas, who ﬁnished together. In ad-
dition to those three bests in run-
ning, Jessica Madoc-Iones had a
personal best in the long jump, All

four of lhesealhletes had very good
performanccsin fairlybadweather.

Hopefully. this weekend’s
weather wtll bemuch nicernsGrtn-
net] is hosting the Dclong Classic
meet. There will be more than
twenty teamsparticipating here with
some very good competition for all
the athletes. This meet will have a
lot ofrelays and some other events,
such as the 10,000M. which are not
usually on the schedule. According
to Coach Freeman, the team will
“focus on relays" mainly because
almost everyone can run on at least
one team.

Since Lhis meet is not a scoring
meet. Coach Freeman is looking

individuals. Withoutscores. the 21th
letes can be much more concerned
with simply improving their own
performances, without thowor‘ry of
how the team is faring. The team
would like to urge people to come

ful as last year‘s.

Softball team falls to
Cornell in doubleheader

By Susan Thomas

This week the Grinnell College
softball team faces a difficult
doubleheadermatch-up.Yesterday.
the Pioneers were scheduled to
travel to Coe for a doubleheader,
and Illinois College will visit the
Pioneers on Saturday. Grinnell was
swept last year by both learns de-
spite playing one of their toughest
games of the season against Coe
and having close tilts against them.

The Pioneers lost to Cornell, 8-
3 and 7-6. last week before the lain
forced them to cancel their trip to
Knox. The week moved the team's
record to 4-6 overall, and 1-3 in
conference play. After decisively
losing the first game to Cornell. the
Pioneers rallied in the second and

had a chance to prevent a sweep.

However. in the bottom of the
sixth it was 473 in Grinnell’s favor,
and Cornell had the bases loaded
with two outs, Cornell’s Colleen
McElmeel hit one behind the short-
stop and a Pioneer error allowed
three runners to score. This made
the score 64. Grinnell then rallied
to tie in the seventh, but ultimately
lost in the bottom of the ninth.

Tera Jones continued her out-

with three doublesrn thefttstgarne,
tallying a total of four doubles for
the day.

Tracy Putnam for her cffons at first
base and pitcher Dori McLennan
for her commitment and improve-
