Led by Dave Dorsey's second half
scoring bonanza, the Grinnell College men's
basketball team rallied to beat Illinois
College 89—84 last weekend. Grinnell was
down by seven points at halftime before
Dorsey sparked the Pioneers by scoring
twenty-one second half points.

Unfortunately for Grinnell, the Winter
Waltz destroyed the floor in Darby, forcing
the team to play what was to be a home
game at Wartburg College. Without the home
crowd in front of which they had been so
eager to play, the team was unable to beat
Wartburg, despite fifteen point points from
Terry Chapko, who was replacing regular
starter Doug Sauerwein. Grinnell lost
89-73.

The home game against Cornell that
was to be played on Friday the Thirteenth,
has also been rescheduled as an away game.
Chances are, though, the Grinnell hoopsters
won't be missing Darby too much when they
travel to Florida over Christmas break to
get some practice in the sun.

No longer looking like a Chinese proverb, the
familiar institution of the Grinnell
landscape has regained its 'T' to become
