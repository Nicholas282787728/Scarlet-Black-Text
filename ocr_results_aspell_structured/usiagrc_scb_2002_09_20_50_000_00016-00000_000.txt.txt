For the past week, many around Grinnell have been
asking when the killing will stop. The volleyball team’s
answer is, “Hopefully never...ifyou’re watching a volley»
ball game.”

A kill, Betsey Blanche ’05 explained, is when “some-
one hits the ball over and it hits the ground or the ball is
hit and deflects offofa player and into out ofbounds. So
you essentially kill the play.”

The Pioneers had plenty ofthem last weekend as they
made a formidable statement by clawing their way to a
secondvplace finish in the Grinnell College tournament.
Grinnell hosted three other teamsi
Fontbonne, William Penn, and Eureka—
who played one another in a preeconferv
ence event here on campus,

“We go into these tournaments trying
to solidify the team’s play,” explained team
captain Mariah Hibaiger ’02.5. “We have
six seniors this year, so a lot of us have
been playing together over the past few
years.”

And solidify the team’s play they did,
making it to the ﬁnals on Saturday. But
first they had to win their games on Fri-
day.

“It was an awesome game with a lot
ofscreaming fans," said Claire Matheny
’04, describing the ﬁrst game of Friday’s doubleheader.
Grinnell took on Fontbonne at 6 pm. in what many
considered one ofthe most exCitiI‘ig volleyball games in
Grinnell‘s recent history. Pontbonne’s team only consists
of eight women where as Grinnell’s team has more than
two sides worth of players.

The Griffins won the opening two games ofthc match,
the second out 54752, in dramatic fashion. But Grinnell
endured the initial onslaught and was able to use its sue
perior numbers to wear down Fontbonnc in a war ofat-
trition. Grinnell won three straight games and started

“It was very excrting to
watch. The teams were
so evenly matched that it
was one of the best
games I have ever seen."

offthe tournament 1-0,

“It was very exciting to watch, as one can tell by the
fans standing on their seats," commented assistant coach
Erin Schmidt. “The teams were so evenly matched that it
was one ofthe best games I have ever seen."

But again the devil is in the details and Grinnell’s home
court and numbers persevered over Fontbonne.

Later that night, in a game slated [D started at 8 p.m.,
(but which actually teed offan hour later), Grinnell de-
feated William Penn in four games, avenging a loss to the
Statesman in the season opener.

In Saturday's noon games, Grinnell won easily over
Eureka (which went 073 in the tournament without win-

ning a set en route [0 an 0-13 start
for the year), while Fontbonne shut
down Penn 3-0 to set up a rematch
of the tournament's exciting
opener.

Fontbonne again started the
match off with winning the first
two games. After learning from
their mistakes, they were able to do
feat Grinnell in the third game and
win the tournament.

“We were disappointed not to
beat Fontbonne again, but we were
happy about our overall play in the
tournament," said Hibarger
aftewards. “[Fontbonne] was the
first team we’ve seen to [have a] utiplaycr, which is a purely
defensive player." [See boxed inset] “She was honored
with an Alerournnmcnt honor, which is so rare for a
purely defensive player.

“We werc excited ‘to have three players named to the
All-Tourney list and one ofour plnycrs got the Tournar
rncnt MVP," Hibarger added. '

Grinncll (5—2) continues its season Sept. 2021 at the
Buenu Vista Tournament in Storm Lalte, IA before com—
ing home to rice Penn yet again on Sept. 24.

One of the big concerns entering the year was a host of new
rule changes to be employed for the first time this tall in
volleyball. The Pioneers haven’t always maximized the po»
tent‘ial of the new rules, but then, they haven't needed to.
For the casual volleyball fan, volleyball standout Stephanie
Schmidt ’03 offered the 5&B‘an explanation of the two most
striking new regulations.

The libero (LEE-bah-ro) player:

Volleyball teams are now only allowed 12 substitutions per game, but
with this new regulation comes a new and radical exception: the libero player.

”[The] two rules go hand in hand,” explained Stephanie Schmidt '03.
”This is the player you'll see on the court wearing a different-colored jersey."

Liberos are defensive specialists, barred from such offensive activities as
sewing, attacking, or setting beyond the attack line. But the libero doesn't
count as a substitution, and can thus be brought on as often as the team
wishes.

”The exchange of the libero and player they are replacing on the court
requires no referee action," said Schmidt, “so you will see the player simply
enter the game from the sideline after a rally, almost similar to that of hockey
replacements.

”The libero is supposed to make a team better defensively and then sub-
sequently better offensively because the setter is receiving better passes to
work with. As a setter, I want the best passer out there so I can run plays and
work Mth opposing blockers. The less running I have to do, the more options
I have offensively. However, it also means that we are fadng a ’tightef de-
fense if the other team is using a libero, which then makes putting the ball
away more difficult. Basically, the NCAA is trying to create a more exciting
and close game with the adoption orthc libero, while creating an opportunity
for the smaller athlete.”

Clearly, the Pioneers know how to utilize this new aspect of the game, but
they have yet to do so in a game this year.

”We are comfortable with our defensive set—up as is,” said Schmidt, "and
we have not run into a situation where we are running out of substitutions for
a game.

The pursuit rule:

in; rule, with regards to playing the ball, basically extends the bounds of
the court as far as a player can run without hitting a wall or a spectator. rhe
pursuit rule states that a team can play the ball ”until they hear a whistle,” or
until the ball touches the ground. This means that if the ball is in the air
anywhere on the team’s side of the net, it can he played. Moreover, explained
Schmidt, 3 team can even ”retrieve a ball that has crossed the centerline
outside the court under certain circumstances. For example, a ball is passed
over the helm amide cfthe court area (ﬁrst touch); you can run around the
referee stand to the other side of the court, send the ball back to your court
(second touch) and then complete the play by attacking the ball at the
opponent's court (third and hnal touch). Sound confusing? Itis. We have yet
to encounter a team that has accomplished this feat, but I'm sure we will."

The bottom line?

”Just don’t be surprised if you're watching a game and see the players
running around the court and gym chasing balls down more than usual,” said
Schmidt.
