The Downhill Road; A Relapse

Once or twice during our stay at this august insti—
tution of sweetness, light, and higher learning, we have
entered a class suffering. the usual pie-examination Visceral
termoil, moist palms, and throbbing head, taken our seats
with an outward sllow of calm, and joked half-heal'tedly
with classmen over the coming terrol:

Then tlle instructor stalks academically into the room,
plops down his imposing stacks of exams, and demands
apologetically that we rise from our seats and bring all our
books, notes, cribs (chuckle), etc, to the front of the room
and there to stack them in little neat piles on the floor!

TELL US, GOOD READERS, WHAT SORT OF VILE
NONSENSE IS THIS?

First let us confess that this has not happened often.
Until just the other day, it hadn't happened for almost two
years. But then again, it struck _ ,

In the past, when we were young and had hide like a
rhinoceros, this lothsome ritual was thrown off as a mere
whim of some obvious crackpot who had, through pull and
possibly blackmail, attained a position on the faculty. But
it has since then been revealed to us that this idea is from
the administration‘s inmost sanctum. Not an executive
order, of course, but an executive suggestion There is a
difference, yet? 5 \

With this disclosure we suddenly felt as l we had
been terribly and unjustlytcheated. We have spe talmost
four years under the false axs'lmption that the administra-
tion held for lls at least a mo um of understanding, sym-
pathy, and respect! We have requently gloried in telling
our friends in the outside world that “say, pal, ya‘ know
Grinnell once had an honest to God honor system?"

Gone is that glory, shattered along with some of our
other pet ideals about academic freedom, innate honesty,
and basic human integl‘rty!

Our only resort now is to plead with our Student Coun-
cil which has been studying a new honor system to please,
for Heaven’s sake, get with it! We realize it’s a tough
job . . , but time is running out. ,

ings by Kcrl Priebe have arous-
ed more than the usual amount
of comment from Grinncll stli»
dents.

Here We have a new trend in
modern art. As we magazine
pointed out in four pages den
voted to Priebe’s painting, the
new direction in American art
is away from pure abstraction
in a “search for beauty both in
representational art and in the
more subjective works.”

At 33, Priebe, a leader in the
phantasy school of art, enjoys a
personal success indicative of
the success of that trend in an.

The young Wiscons/in artist
says that okapis, unicorns, gir-
affes, and Weasels are his fav-
orite animals. According to Life
the unusual dark-skinned peo»
ple of Priebe’s paintings are not
inhabitants of Bali or Java but
were “inspired by the Negro
singers, actors, and composers
with whom Priebe spends much
of his spare time.” /
