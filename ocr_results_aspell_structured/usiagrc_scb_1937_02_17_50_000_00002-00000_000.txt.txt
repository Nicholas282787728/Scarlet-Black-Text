British Lecturer Criticizes Democracies
for Irresolution During World Crises

Speaker Lists Dangerous,
Favorable Factors
for World Peace

Irresolution on the par-t of de—
mocracies of the world was cited
by w. Arnold-Forster, British
laborite, last night as the main
cause for the present chaotic con—
ditions of world peace.

Speaking on the subject “This
Dangerous World," the first of a
series of erght public lectures
which he will give, he pointed
out that had the great democra—
cies acted forcefully since 1931,
the dictators would not have dare
ed attempt the steps that they
have. .

In presenting a balance sheet
of debit and credits for world
peace at present, Mr. Arnold-For-
ster listed five factors as making
for war and four for peace. He
listed irresolution on the part oft
democracies, apparent triumph of
dictatorships, the armament race,
new technique of aggression and
a disillusionment of “making
world safe for- democracy" as the
dangerous tendencies in present
day international affairs.

Clearer Opinion.

On peace srde he credited the
clarification of British oprnion,
the possible weaknesses of dicta-
torships, a new and growing con-
fidence between England and the
United States, and the faint signs
of a change in opinion in the
United States about neutrality,l
as helpf factors.

T:- the examples of the ir-
resolution of the democracies in
the crises that occurred in Man-
churi, Ethiopia and Spain, Mr.
Arnold-Forster declared, “Since
1931, the democracies of the
world have been forced to concede
by menace what they would not
concede by reason." J
Policy of Conquest.

The Japanese are pursuing a
policy of conquest across Asia but
had the great democracies acted
promptly in 1931, they ”wnuId
not have missed the bus."

In commenting upon the atti—
tudes of England and France in
the recent Ethiopian situation, Mr.
Al'nold»Forster criticized the fail-
ure of both nations to defend
their plain treaty obligations. “Ifl
in either January or March, 1935.;
England and France had made
plain to the world that they!
would defend the League of Na ,
tions, Italy would have stopped
its aggressive policy. However ‘
when the democratic nations did
act, Mussolini had landed a quar ,
ter of a million troops on the,
other side of the Suez.“ I

America, too, was criticized for‘l
its policies during the Italian ag—l
gression. “The United Statesl

money by the larger expert Sales"
the speaker said. “However, that
doesn't excuse the failure of En-
gland and France to live up to
treaty obligations.”

. Premier Leon Billm’s non-inter-
vention policy in the present
Spanish civil war was termed
“dangerous” by the Laborite.
“The legislation has acted to put
the rebel forces on equal footing
with the legitimate government.
This is a very dangerous course,
especially since the agreementhas
only served to prevent the rogu-
lar government from receiving the
supplies to which it is legally en-
titled. Any policy which operates
only on one side imperils the
foundations of the cooperative
peace system," he warned.

Concentration Camps

“Regardless of what you may
have heard, Hitler still is using
concentration camps to stamp out
opposition in Germany. Even tor-
ture is used to break down the
spirit of those against Hitler."

In torrching upon the present
armament race, which has seen
world arms trebled within a per
iod of five years, Mr. Arnold
Forster declared, “If the present
situation goes on unchecked for
five years, there will and must
he some kind of an explosion."

New Form of Aggression

A new form of aggression, in-
ternal revolt, has been developed
since the World War, the speaker
pointed out, and already is seen
working in the Spanish civil war.
“The aggressive nations do not
resort to flagrant and open war-
fare, but stir up the restless ele—
ments in the populations until
civil war breaks out. If Hitler
and Mussolini are successful in
Spain, then probably within six
months there will he similar dis~
turbances among the three mi
lion Germans now under the Czee
Clio-Slovakian ﬂag.”

more favorable side of the peace

balance sheet, Mr. ArnoldJi‘m'ster
pointed out that British public
opinion is no longer confused and
that there is gathering force be-
hind moves to support and
strengthen the collective peace
system.
Germany Weaker

He also considered the possible
weaknesses of the Violent states
as a factor contributing to world
peace. “Geri-natty today is far
weaker than in 1914, while both
Italy and Japan have been winks
enerl by their aggressions in
Ethiopia and Manchuko respee
lively."

He also stressed the new and
growing confidence between me
United states and Great Britain.
“Today in no quarter of England
can you find any apprehension
about any armament program
that the United states may see
fit to embark upon. The United
states and Great Britain are not
allies but colleagues in the strug-
gle to maintain the collective
peace system," he asserted.

Mr. Arnold-Forster will give
his second public lecture at 7:20
o'clock Thursday night in the
auditorium of Alumni Recitation
hall, speaking on the topic, “Iso-
lation and Neutrality."

reason why Grinnell shouldn’t
have a regular year book. “The
depression is over now and a
regular annual should be able to
pay for itself. However, as time
did not permit, and as the faculty
committee deemed it wiser to
start republication on a small

scale, it was decided ‘to publish

the annual in magazine form this
year, By next year Grinnell
should again see the Cyclone.”

Plans call for the book to have
at least 64 pages and to be bound
magazine style with a cover in
color.

Staff Tryouts

"I plan to hold staff tryouts in
the near future and hope to se-
cure some good new ideas from
persons who have had experience
on prep school year books. Per-
sons intercsted in working on the
business staff should see me this
week. Editorial tryouts will be
held next week.”
