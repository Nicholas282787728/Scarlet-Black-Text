And This
Isn’t All
of the Story!

“My, how did so many boys get
hurt?" asked an elderly Grinnell
housewife. when she saw a goodly
number on crutches yesterday morn-
ing.

Grinnell studens and professors
knew. however, that these apparent
cripples were not maimed in spring
basketball practice or track, but were
merely some of the evidences of the
semi-annual prep days now in effect.

Chapel yesterday was illeattended
because it was unable to compete
with the variety of entertainment
offered by the ludicrously dressed
and queer acting freshmen, who per-
formed about Alumni Recitation hall.

A group of Scottish highlanders
paraded in the street; one freshman
harangued amused collegians from a
soap box; another scrubbed the side-
walk industriously with a tooth
brush; a quintet of vagabond song—
sters entertained a crowd in front
of the chapel; and foolishness rcigned
Supreme as ohliging professors
smilcd knowingly and perhaps a lit-
tle sardonically.

The tweeday probation period will
end at 6 a.m. Sunday.

biggest with the least effort." The
Green Gloves and Purple Stockings
are presented to the most sophisti-
cated man and woman. The Leather
Medal and thc Kite are awarded for
the best line. and the Daisy and Lily
are given to the man and woman who
most deserve the title of purity.
Mystery Again

Again the Mystery cup will be pre-
sented. Last year it was given to the
man who thought he would get the
Brown Derby, but didn't.

This year the Mystery cup will be
awarded for a different purpose and
until the master of ceremonies pre-
sents it the night of May 6 at the
Borwn Derby dance, the reason for
giving this award will remain a
secret,

Penn—Fresh

Invade Track

Will Compete
Here Monday

Yearlings

A group of Penn college freshmen
will offer competition to the Grinneil
preps in a track mcet to be held at
Ward field Monday at 4:30 pm.
Coach Elton Resell, of the local fresh-
man group will havc charge of the
meet.

In scanning the results of the res
cent Home track meet, it is shown
that several members of the fresh-
man group are capable pct-formers,
having ability equal to some of the
upperclassmen, Probably the out
standing feat of the last meet on the
part of a first year man was made
in the Mil-yard run, in which Don
Barnes skipped the distance in 51.4
seconds to edge out Anderson. Barnes
also placed in the 220-yard dash.

Another prep, Bob Bair, showed a
great deal of speed in placing Second
in Lne IDDryard dash, in which Alex-
anderwas pushed to a record time
of 9.9 seconds to win. In the weight
division Parke Burrows seems to be
the most promising. being capable in
both the shot put and the discus
throw. Bob Innes will uphold the
young Pioneers in the javeiin throw,
while George Shack will be entered
in the high jump. Several other men
will be competing when the entry
list is completed.

cil who were recently elected to

not take part in the actual business,
they will have an opportunity to see
how the meetings are conducted. This
will be the last regular mecting for
the retiring council.

til 6 am. Sunday and that if any
paddling is done at all, it should be
done by the house councils.

Treasury reports of each building
should be submitted to the council
by Thursday. the council decreed.

A possibility that golf may be
made an intramural sport was made
public by the council. Luther Hemp-
hill, house president of Dibble ball.

The following committees were ap-
pointed by tbe president: intramural
trophies, Joseph Pfeiffer and Clar-y
