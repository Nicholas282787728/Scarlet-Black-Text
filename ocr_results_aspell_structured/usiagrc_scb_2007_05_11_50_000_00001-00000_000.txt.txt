Angela Davis to speak
at commencement

BY MACAELA HOLMES

Angela Davis was once ﬁred for being a
member orrhc Communist Party, she was on
the FBI's Ten MostWanIed List, and she is a
former member ofthe Black Panthers. Given
her hisroiy of agitation, many schools would
consider Davis a risky choice as commence
menr speaker. But not Grinnell.

“[1 am] really glad that we picked Davis,
She really reﬂects our population very well in
a sense ofsoeial justice," said Lester Airman
‘07, a Commencement Committee member,

Rachel Bly'93,the DiiectorofConfetenCe
operations and Events, who is the staffspon-
set of the Commillce, said Davis was chosen
because she is an inspirational figure.

“He-r commitment to socialjuslice is also
one that is dedicated to a cause, and she is iioI
afraid Io fight for ll.” Bly said. “She has that
Grinnell spirit ofpioiiccring and being ahead
thel' time," i

Davis's long history of activism firs: came
to nanonal prominence in 1969 after she was
ﬁred from her position at UCLA because of
her afﬁliation With the Communisr party.

A year later, Davis was placed on the FBI's
Ten Mosr Waiich Fugitives List on charges
of conspiracy kidnapping and homicxdc rer
lared ro the murder of judge Harold Haley
during an arrcmprcd Black Panther prison
break.

Afror two months as a fugitive under—
ground, D. was capntred and spent 16
monrhs in prison, She was eventually acquit
red ofall i ntges after an iurcrnarional move
mcnt calling for her release and one of the
mosr famous trials in recent hisrory. Now, in
her role as Professor of History of Consciousr
iiess at the University of Cilirornia Santa
Cruz, Davis teaches classes on the intersec—
tion of race, gender and class.

Davis has taught or eight different col-
lcges and universities and has written numer-
ous books, many ofwhicli focus on the social
problems associared with incarceration She is
a dent ciiric or both rho death penalty and
racism in rhc U.S. criminal Justicc sysrern and
advocarcs prison abolition. ,

The process of picking DliVis began dur-
ing the spring nf2006 when the Commencv
menr Commirtee was formed. Comprised
enrircly of students, rhe committee crcared a
list of poreurial speakers, which could be ye-
toed by n faculty panel.

Suggestions come from both the studenrs

on the committee and staff members. Each

.scniot is also given rhc opportunity to suggest

a speaker in a mass email. The list is then
narrowed ro about twenty candidates.

OthCi suggested candid-arcs for this year
included senator Baraclt Obama, Srephen
Colherr, Ellen Degeneres, Oprah Winfrey
and Bruce Springsteen.

Bly said commencement speakers gener-
ally aim high yet are realisric and are good
public speakers The commirrcc looks fol
provocative and thoughtful speakers thnr Can
give be borh memorable and relevant to stun
deors.

After making their final decisions. com—
mirree members ranked the list of potential
candidates, though accurding to Ely, the order
is nor rigid.

Obama was the committee’s first choice
to be speaker, bur could not trrend due ro
scheduling conﬂicts. Aleman was ulnmately
pleased with the selection. “Davis carries
moie characteristics of Grinnell College," he
said.“So we got htr,"

Honotaiy degrees will be awarded to John
