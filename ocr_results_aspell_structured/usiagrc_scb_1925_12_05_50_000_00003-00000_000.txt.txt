MAEMILLEN PRESENTS
IJIFHIJUU PHDGHAM

American violinist Displays Mastery
of instrument: Audience is Free
With Applause.

"Francis diacmillen, American vio-
linst, presented a program of consid—
erable difficulty, well chosen to dis
play the technical mastery of his in-
strument, before a large audience in
Herrick chapel, Wednesday evening.

Mr. Macmillen scored a personal
"hit" with his audience, if the up—
plause which he received may be con-
sidered a. true criterion of its emu-er
elation. He was forced to respond
with several encores.

The American artist chose as his
"tour en force" the Lalo “Symphonie
Espagnole," a familiar item on concert
programs“ and while he gave, all
things considered, a brilliant rendir
Lion of the Work, his interpretation
did not compare favorably with that
of other ‘n'olinlsts Who havefpel‘form»
ed the same work at various times in
Grinnell. i

Mr. Maemillen found his milieu in
the shorter compositions which made
up the second half of his program
The Schubert-Wilhelmj “Ave Maria”
was played With sincerity; Mr. Mac-
millan here paid less attention to
pyrotechnics and was more the inns—
isian, less the virtuoso. The“Rol-ldo
Caprlccioso" Of Saint Saens required
artistry which BIr. Macmillen did not
seem to possess. His playing of this
composition was uneven; his attack
was spirited, but certain measures
were blurred and indistinct. Mr. Mace
mlllen often found it necessary to
reach his notes by a, sudden and deft
"slide‘ from his ﬁrst, incorrect tune.

Mr. Macmillen exhibited a. la—‘
mentable tendency to achieve a bri
liancy which was not quite in his
genre. He seemed to strain for elfect;
perfection was aften sacrificed for
impression. Several musical nonen'ti-
ties found their Way into the major
part of his program, placed there pre-
sumably to draw forth udmlrlng"ah
from his admirers less intent upon
musicianship than the agility of the
bow.

the potentialities of his instrument.
In uncertain intervals he obtained
rich sonoi‘ity. delicate phrasing and
humid effects.

dignified and effective support at the

According to college tests, man develops one-eighth
horsepower for short periods and one-twentieth in
steady work. As a craftsmanra worker who uses

brains—he is well worth his daily wage.

But as a

common laborer, matching brawn against motor-
ized power, he is an expensive luxury.

With a ﬁfty-horsepower motor, for instance, one
man can do the work of 400 common laborers. He
is paid far more for his brains than his brawn.

The great need of this and future generations is
for men who can plan and direct. There is ample
motorized machinery for all requirements of pro-

duction and construction.

Highly trained brains are needed more and

more to think, plan, and direct tasks for the
never-ending application of brawn—saving elec-

tricity.
