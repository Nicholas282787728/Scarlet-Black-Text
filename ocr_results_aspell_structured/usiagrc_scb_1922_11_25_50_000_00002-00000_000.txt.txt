DISCUSSION GROUPS

Tomorrow evening the men of the

years. The men’s senate has institut-
ed a plan of Sunday evening discus—
sion groups among the men of each
dormitory hall. Each group will be
in charge of a competent leader, and
will be in the nature of an open

hour. '
There is need for just such discus—
sion groups, and it is to be hoped that
they will prove highly productive of
some good clear thinkink on the part
of all the men. Some may think that
because the discussions are sched<
nled ror Sunday evenings they will be
religious or theological. This is not
the case, and those who conceived
the idea in the ﬁrst place had no‘
idea of making the plan one of bible
study or of a Sunday school lesson,
in the narrower sense of the word.‘
We do not mean to say that the men
don’t need this kind of discussion, but
that can be well taken care of else~
where, The discussion tomorrow
night is on the topic of the men’s
senate~yvimt it is and what it should
be.

No one need fear that these groups
are out of place or that the men are
not given to free discussion of col-
lege aﬂsil‘s. Any senior who has
spent three years in the dormitories
knows that some very serious and
constructive thinking is done by the
men in small sessions in dormitory,
rooms. The idea of the discussion
groups is to center and concentrate
this thought for a few minutes once
a week. Live topics upon current
problems will he discussed.

Those who lead the discussions
will have to combat at cermin
reticenco on the part or the men to
discuss topics which are more or less
personal, delicate, or "ticklish." By
this we mean such subjects as the
men's senate, which is composed of
many of the men themselves; the nth

have views which they tear will not
