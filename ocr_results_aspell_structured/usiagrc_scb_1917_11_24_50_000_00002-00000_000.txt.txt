Grinnell is fortunate in having a
good school of music

Am] Grinnellians should not miss
the opportunity of hearing the cons
carts and rceitals that. are brought
here every year by that instituu‘on.

The programs by outside musicians
and by local talent are both worth
while. The Wednesday afternoon res
oitals by the school at music faculty
will be continued thru the winter.
They are held at a convenient hour,
just before dinner, and they are short
enough to be enjoyed by all students
