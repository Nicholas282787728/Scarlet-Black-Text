Everywhere you look these days you see the word': NUCLEAR. Walk
into the Bookstore and glance at the magazine rack. NUCLEAR. Look at
the bulletin boards in the Post Office and the Forum. NUCLEAR 0r
look at the frong page of this week’s 5&8. NUCLEAR. Why this sudden
proliferation of nuclear awareness? Because we‘re all finally realizing
something that we, as citizens in a collective global community, have
known since 1945 — nukes are not nice.

In fact, given the inability of the world’s superpowers to accept forms
of government which do not operate as theirs do plus the delight these
same superpowers take in dominating weaker nations, nukes are in-
sane, And with the number of times the United States and the Soviet
Union can destroy the world increasing each day, the chance that we
will all be killed by nuclear weapons edges toward probability. Because
let’s be realistic, there will be no limited nuclear war. Especailly with no
limit to the production of nuclear weapons, it’s like handling a small
child a package of double-stuff Oreos, telling him to eat only one and
then walking away.

Everyone 7 American, Sovies, people of the Third World, people
caught in between — must evaluate the information that is now
available to them. But because of the sheer volume of material now be-
ing published, many of us will become insensitive to the imminent
threat. Sometimes it’s just easier to “blow it off,” rather than sift
through the stacks of information, both pro and con.

We may already have the seeds of insensitivity within us. After all, the
majority of the people in this campus have grown up with the knowledge
that their friends, their possessions, their worlds could be blown away in
a matter of minutes. Yet how many of us really believe that such
destruction could ever happen? Sure, we’ve seen Dr. Strangelove and
our president has been peering through the window of vulnerability but
do you really think that you would be b10Wn to smithereens by a nuclear
weapon or die on agonizingly long and painful death due to the effects of
nuclear fallout?

This week is National Ground Zero Week, which is designed to give us
all time to educate ourselves about nuclear issues. We recognize that
we’re being trendy by devoting so much space to the threat of nuclear
war. And we know that few of us have the time to read through much
other literature about the problem. But it is a problem and it is so much
greater than we’re willing to admit. _

So please, read the front page article. Find out what has been gomg on
here at Grinnell, see what other people in Iowa are doing and compare
the conflicting proposals now before the U.S. Senate and House of
Representatives. Then look at the next page and read about what you
can do. NUCLEAR is not going to go away by itself.

Howdy Doody does the

It someone had told me a couple or years
ago that Ronald Reagan was gomg to be
president, i would have laughed; Howdy
Doody stood a better chance But, with the
Ayatollah’s manipulation of our election
process and the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan, Jimmy Carter's credibility
(he never seemed to be doing anything
besides tending his roses) as well as the
United States' was called into question.
With the added humiliation of our soldiers
dying in the Iranian desert, the impossible
happened: Howdy Doody was elected, By
this time Howdy was a cowboy, ready to
clean up the image of America and change
her economy.

The new sherili blew into town, packing
a pistol underneath his smart Jacket.
Behind him was his wife, pleasantly dress»
ed. her gown glimmering in the noonday
sun (a lot of diamonds, you knowl. Reagan
was not Howdy Doody at all, he was more
like Matt Dillon Before the Congress knew
what happened. Reagan had pushed
through a drastic budget, one that may, it
he has his way, cause a prolound change in
our tuture economy. Later on, he Looted
parts or his program as the "new
federalism," the simple answer to all our
problems. But what exactly is this new
federalism? The new federalism is the ol-
iicxal transfer or programs (i e, Food
Stamps, Aid to Dependent Children, etc.)
away lrom die federal government to the
states. This transfer could result in the ex-
ploitation by certain states of the poor. due
to economic and racial prejudices,

To the Editor:

We've just emerged from a long, fierce
winter The blizzard in early April killed
our weekend plans and shriveled the early
spring plants but we knew they’d survive
and so would we. Spring was coming, and
that assurance pulled us through. We live
in a bleaker, more sinister winter,
however, that shows no sign oi thaw It‘s
the ever-present threat of thermonuclear
war. It has been with us so long that we
sometimes forget what an awful chill we
suffer,

Many people don't tool the chill at all To
them, the arms race is a political game,
They play a strategy war as isolated from
time, space and reality as the remote
deserts and oceans in which they test the
new weaponry. The arms race is a career,
not a spiritual‘winter 7 a defense necessi»
ty and a big piece oi the economy to bootl
They would call our numb fear 0! global
nuclear war emotional hogwash. “We’re
talking 'bout the Russians,
y'understand7"

Anyone who reads the paper knows that
the U.S. and the USSR, can turn this
earth into a charred husk 30 times over
with the warheads we have now. The US
alone manufactures three more
Hiroshimas every day What 13 national
security? A sell-suiticient people or a
bloated, ticking arsenal? Making the
world safe tor our economic system has
only made it dangerous for humanity,
animals, plants and microbes. Citizens of
the superpowers are all trapped in their
seltrimposed winter of despair. And like
the seasonal winter, it seems impossible to
resist,

But we could resist, The trouble is, we
think too practically, We think, “Gee. I
don‘t have any high connections in the
State Department. How can i, a lowly
liberal arts student, make a difference?"
What we can do is not practical at all, just
as there is nothing practical one can do
about falling snow. The politicians and
military leaders who lorce us to run the
arms race will always ﬁnd jobs, Ignorance
and hatewill always keep people from

Ronald Reagan was poor once but he pull-
ed himsell up by his bootstraps and
became president of these United States.
How quaint. How Horatio Alger. The
American dream! Follawmg along the
same logic, any man rrom Harlem can do
me same thing. He can just look in the
paper and find a Job (of course there are
always jobsi and then get to be governor or
his state and then president. In fact, he can
do anything, Good 01‘ Reagan, the eternal
optimist.

Picture this. You are an Hispanic and
live in Spanish Harlem. You are on welfare
and you've got a small job, which pays you
in cash so you don't pay tax, this on top of
another job that you do pay tax on, You
pick up the paper and read something like:
“Reagan to slash taxes, cut welfare " The
article then tells you how lucky you are to
be granted this tax cut, because now you
won’t need welfare (which you are sup-
posedly sponging oil of anyway) and
maybe you will get a job. You think. “Hey,
I know! I'll become a sportscaster and
then president! " Yeah, right:

Recently, on the plane ride to Grinnell, 1
met a man who was a “corporatlve ex»
ecutive." He told me that Reagan had to be
given a chance. I asked why I should trust
someone who left the problems of the poor
to the private sector. He told me that the
private sector would naturally pick up the
slack after the poor's funds were cut off,
Why? Because.

“Because why?" I prodded “Because,”
he said, “people are not going to let others
starve or live in degradation." Staring at

 

trusting “the other side.”

Rather than freeze in our cynicism,
however, we can do what the powerless
have often done: create a symbol. A
demonstration of our concern such as a
parade, a song, a resolution or a silent vigil
may seem comically impotent at the time
but eventually our symbolic acts achieve
practical goals, People who have never
thought about the arms race before sit up
and take notice (thanks to the media).
They sense our outrage and begin to
wonder how happy they feel about 10,000
nuclear warheads protecting them. Once
world leaders realize that public sentiment
is for nuclear disarmament, we'll see
some changes, Public sentiment, despite
its soft connotations, is a tough political
bear to tangle with.

It's time to createa symbol here at Grin»
nell. Are We ready to make our convictions
public? some would suggest that it is not
this institution's business to wade into
questions such as the morality of
militarism. They insist that education
should be roped off from politics and
morality. We ' should be “objective."
Holders of this viewpoint feel that in-
dividual expressions of paciiism and dis»
sent are fine but that the college as an enti»
ty can take no moral position.

I don't buy that. Grinnell may have
given up its church affiliation but has it
stopped encouraging us to value life and
human dignity? These “biases" are at th
heart of the nuclear freeze movement. The
lirst page of the college catalogue declares
that Grinnell College does not discriminate
on the basis of “sex, race, color, creed,’
etc. The arms race discriminates against
those whose tood stamps are cut so that
another $1.5 million Trident Submarine
can be built. It discriminates against the
people or the Third World who are pawns
in the capitalistcommunist chess game,
And it discriminates against our own unr
born children who will grow up in the
shadow of the bomb, if they live at all.

Values are at the heart of this institution.
When apparently sane bureaucrats talk
about ”limited nuclear conflict,” we can‘t
aftord to forget our sense of communlt
and the values we hold in common, We
must condemn the arms race, both in
tellectually and in our hearts, AND DO I
OPENLY.NVhen wedo, we will have taken

- the-first step out of this desolatewinterim
