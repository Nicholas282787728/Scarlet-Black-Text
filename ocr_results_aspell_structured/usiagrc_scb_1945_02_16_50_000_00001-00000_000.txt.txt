Annual Student Government
Presidential Battle Looms

~——-!Dark Horses Clouded By Leading Trio
Primary Monday

This week as the snow melted and spring approached, the
first political whispers and campaigm rumors were heard
throughout the campus, and the date for the 1945 Student
Council presidential election was set for March 5. A11 indi-
cations pointed to a close campaign battle, while a. multitude
of capable candidates were being pushed by their friends
'nto consideration for the office. ‘

Primary balloting will begin
during the housemeetings in the
cottages and halls Monday night,
February 19, Gerry Ross, present
Student Council president, an-

.Although the election will
probably not he as thrilling as in

across campus, poster portraits
of nominees w’ere plastered on
walls, and unusual campaign
stunts were always in the offing,
an interesting and highly unpre—
dictable battle may occur be
tween mree leading candidates
and several “dark horses."

Women Lead Race

Since the student body this
year’is predominantly feminine,
and indications are that it will
still be next year, general opin.
ion is that a woman will be the
victor. Jack Hartley, Pine Tree
president and only male candi-
date, may, however, have strong
support in his favor in the fact
that up to the last two years a
man has ruled the student body
of Grinnell college. With a re-
vival of that tradition, Hartley
may emerge as a “dark horse."

Loading Candidates

oh the crowded field of “possi»
bilitiu," three junior women
seem to be almost certain candi-
dates.

Jessie Ternberg, Read junior,
from Ridgefield. Washington. is
definitely one of them. a YDunkr
er scholar, Miss Ternberg has
been an active leader in extra-
curricular affairs for the past
three years in her rreshman
year she was a Tassel and trees-
urer of Mears second semester
She was elected to serve on the,
Student Council at the close of
last year. and at present is treas-
urer of the organization and on
the central committee. Miss
Ternberg has been in Quill clubl
for the past three years, and is
editorial director for the Scariell
and Block. She has been active
in the W.A.A. for the last two
years, and also belongs to the
League of Women Voters.

A strong contestant for the ti-.
tic of Student douncil president
is cmerging from Hoines basc-
ment in the form of Gerry War-
rcn. From Arlington, Virginia,
Miss Warren was a Tassel and
on freshman commission in her
prep year. Last year she was
art editor for the Cyclone and a
reporter on Scarlet and Black.
in addition she won the inez
Henry Memorial Prize in art.

This year Miss Warren is so-
cial chairman of the Junior class,
on Tanager board, srt editor of
thc Cyclone, and a member of
W.A.A. Women’s editor of the
Scarlet and Black last semester.
she was promoted to associate

Another powerful Redd coll»
tender is Betty Montague of Du-
luth, Minnesota. Shc has had a
leading part in extr-o curricular
activities since her freshmanl

 

,Di-

year when she was a Tassel and
a social chairman of Mears. On
the Student Council for the past
two years, Miss Montague repre—
sented Haines cottage. and this
year is secretary or the Student
Council as well as on central
committee. Last year she was_
president of the sophomore class.
chairman of the YWCA, and has
been in the was for the past
two years. This year she is vice-
president of the junior class, and
