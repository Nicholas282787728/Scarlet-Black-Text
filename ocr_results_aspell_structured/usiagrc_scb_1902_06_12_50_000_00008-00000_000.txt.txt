present Social and Political Condi~
tiohs.” Mr. Ware in beginning con-
gratulated the college in behalf of the
Alumni, on the large graduating class
which it is sending forth this year to
battle for civic righteousness and jus-
tice. He said that present social con-
ditions are not what they ought to be.

We have made much progress but must
make greater progress ill the future.

Local, state and national govern-
ments are yielding too much to the

power of organized wealth. Organ-
ized wealth is organized power. The
speaker maintained that he is not a
pessimist. Nor did he sympathize
with the optimist who refuses to see
and recognize exxsting dangers.

The class that graduates today has
been traveling the path, the race, and
each worthy individual in it must
tread in its journey irom innocency
to matured character. You have had
your Eden long ago. You have had
the discipline at these years or child-
hood and youth. You are to go out
now to the still more severe discipline
or manhood and womanhood. Your
success hitherto marks the path or
future success hoped for, but it does
not guarantee that. s'uccess. As you
have earned the respect and love or
your teachers and associates here, so
we conﬁdently believe you will earn
the respect and love or your fellow
men, beyond the limits or the college
circle, But. there is nothing guaran-
teed. We believe you will play the
man there~as you have played the
man herbthat‘ you will "wear the
white ﬂower" or blameless, womanly
lire there, as you have worn it so
ﬁttingly here. But there as here,
“There is no discharge in that war-
fare," and only he that “cndurcth to
the end, he shall he saved."

yet i'or that reason you are not to
despise them and exalt yourselves. 1
am sure you will not do so cen-
soriously, hut unconsciously you may
do so, unless with utmost patience
you cultivate your sympathies and try
to put them on a level with all sorts
and conditions or men.

For sympathy is the one thing that
ﬁnds no adequate supply. and that en
joys it perennial demand the World
over. it is the one coin current every
where, that never snrt'ers discount or
depreciation. The language you speak
will not always he understood, the
science you know you may not be able
to use everywhere, but the sympathy

people's Ieelingsr Sympathy'ithat en-
aliles you to get the other man's point
or view as well as your own—that
sympathy you need to cultivate, that
it may expand into a hroadminded
generosity and good will toward all
men as you travel upon your road
trom Eden to Paradise.

And God so loved the world that He
has put living things here with their
sensitiveness to enjoyment. and to
pain—packed it run or lire~life the
most wondrous thing oi all—and es-
pecially human liteiinteresting, thi-
ling in its stay—every single individ»

well engage the thought and study or
the wisest; tor ii the tenderest flower
that blooms, suggested to the poet
thoughts too deep for tears, then the
humpiest human lite you meet on Your
journey to Paradise may wcll arrest
your attention, and :truuse your sym-
pathy, and ﬁll you with praise tor the
wisdom or Him who sent you on so
tan- a journey. And because God wiio
made this world thought so well or it,
you will not get into a despairing
mood about it—you will not say mean
things about it, nor slender it, nor
call it a bed world, or a one world.
No, the world that God so loved must
he a good world.

And so you will cultivate that sym-
pathy with God which is genuine rec
liglon. For religion is not, [his form
and that, this creed or the otlicrcrccd;
this religion is real sympathy with
God, and real sympathy with him who
is the tullness oi the‘ godrhead liodily.
We cannot all approach God through

can all ﬁnd God, by one of the many
Ways through which He welcomes His
children to Him, and if we have Sym-
pathy with Him we shall not fail to
ﬁnd Him; it may be through the
books, it may he by way of the
laboratory, it. may be in the busy ward
where men strive for power and place,
it may he in the gentle ministries of
