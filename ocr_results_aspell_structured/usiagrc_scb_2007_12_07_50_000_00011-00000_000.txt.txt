TOM BALDWIN

Organized ladder promotes racquet-eering

BYJEFF RADERSTRONG

One of the greatest sounds audlblc to hue
manity is the being a racquetball makes as it
smashes off your racquet. It’s almost as good
as hearing your opponent frantically scream in
anguish as you turn around to see that he or
she was unable return that small little piece of
blue rubber you just sent ﬂying off the front
wall.

Many who have not played racquetball
before, especially claustrophobics, may he in
timidared by the sport. It involves being put
into a small enclosed room with onHor two
or thrthher people, each with their own
racquet, all With the goal of hitting a ball at
their opponents as fast as possible. So it can be
a little dangerous.

But it is also run and easy to play. “You don't
have to he very good at it to have fun," said
Josh chcr '09. “And I'm not very good at it."
Humble though he is, chcr has beaten me
several times.

Both Weber and I participate in the Race

qucrball Ladder, an informal intramural league
with players ofdiffering skill levels. It has gone
on every semester for several years, and with
increased advertising next semester, the num
her of participants should grow.

The ladder's focus is to connect players, so
that “they have a larger pool of people to play,
instead of playing the same people over and
over," said Tim Hammond, director of intra-
murals and organizer ofthe ladder.

The game is set up as a volley back and
forth between two players, each trying to return
the ball off the front wall, Participants play to
fifteen points, and some volleys for points can
be intense, with shots offofthe backwnll, shots
offcorners and my favorite, the walleclimhing
shot, where you have to Jump up onto the wall
to make a successful return.

“The equipment that is used leads to a
higher speed of game [compared to] ten-
nis,” said Hammond. Bccausc the court is
completely enclosed and so small-4a typical
court is 40 feet long by 20 feet wide and 20 feet

talliplaycrs must he constanrly active during
the game. I have both been hit and hit others
during games, and‘ the worst part is that ifyou
get hit, it counts against you.

Others like to play because it provides an
alternative to the mindless exercise of the Fir
ness Center. “[You are] playing a game, rather
than sitting there jogging," said Virginia Anv
detsen’10,n classmate ufw-rte’s. A game can
turn into quite a workout, since points can
only be won by the server. Depending on the
strength and skill of the two players, frequent
turnover with [cw points scored is a common
occurrence.

Ar ﬁrst, racquetball can be deceiving, Many
might think you are crazy if you duck undere
neath that undersized door. But there is rear
soning behind the swings, the sounds and the
injuries.

“You get to put so much power into the
game," said Hammond. “But it has to be con-
trolled power. "

Swimming avoids non-conference cupcake meets, favoring competition

rtv MARKJAPINGA

While you wouldn’t call it the exhibition
season, early meets for the Grinncll men's and
women’s swimming and diving teams provide
an interesting contrast to the more predictable
conference meets latcr in the year. Between
the seemingly random opponents, such as the
Colorado School of Mines and the University
of NebraskarOmaha, and the fact that most
swimmers participate in a variety ofcvenrs, the
points don’t marter nearly as much as improve
ment. Think ofit more as a endurance build
ing or conditioning stage.

That said, both swim teams still put on
impressive performances to start the season.
Last weekend, the men’s tcam ﬁnished second
out ofsix teams at the Mutual of Omaha In-
vitritionrtl, bentcn only by the bizarrely named
Colorado School ofMincs,a Division II squad.
Thc wotncu ﬁnished in the same predicament,
finishing second to another Division 11 team,
the Univc ochhrnskneOmnha.

The prcvmus wcckcnd, both teams dcmnle
ishcd conference foo Lake Forest, but dropped

close meets to the University ofChicago. But
both of these meets forced Grinncll to swim
up to the level of their opponents.

“We swim early in the season against faster
teams like CSM and UC, who swim twice a
day and lift,” said Nate Wittnam ’09, who won
the ZOOrmcrcr butterﬂy last Weekend. “So this
is putting things in perspective."

The outcomes impressed head coach Erin
Hurley. “We're deﬁnitely ahead of Where We
were in years past,” said Hurley, citing an in-
creased focus on dry land training and lifting.

With Grinncll hosting its own invitational
Jan. 18719, expect more swimmers to be in difL
ferent events than usual. “I want to see them
swim events they wouldn’t otherwise swim. If
we win, great, but it’s more important to see
where people arc,”said Hurley.

Such an attitude points toward the focus
on the individual in swimming, even though
the performance of the team as n whole ulti—
mately makes up the final score. Bur much
like cross country and track, the only event
that really matters is die conference cham-

pionship, meaning that one had meet won't
doom swrmmcrs.

“If you have a bad meet, [Conch Hurley]
will just tell you to treat it like a practice,”
Wittnam said.

So even though Grinncll just can’t seem to
get those few extra points to beat UChicago,
the team isn't necessarily worried by the loss.

“If we’re close to Chicago, it might mean
that I didn‘t swim well or that the team didn‘t
swim well," said Valerie Stimac '09. “But so
many factors come into play that it’s tough
to point at one thing to say that this is why
we lost." Stimac also felt the team swam well,
making her focus less on the overall outcome.
And given stimac's own performance, Comr' —
uring to three secondeplace finishes for Gr' _
hell's relay teams last weekend and winning
the ZOOrmeter freestyle against UChicago and
Lake Forest, she has reason to be satisﬁed.

“[Swimming] adds another dimension in
thtttyou can swim a personal best but still lose
the hear,"shc said. And right now, it’s personal
hosts, not necessarily rcarn hosts, that matter.
