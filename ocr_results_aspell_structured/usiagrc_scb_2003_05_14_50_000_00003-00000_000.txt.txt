The '01 :02 student staffhad a fool-proofplan as they
approached the large bulldozer. In keeping with tradition,
each hall saffwas collecting pictures for the studentsrair
photo suvengcr hunt.

The group was determined to pose at the top ofthe
giant machine, a fear rhar athletic, muscular guys like Dave
Whitcomb ’03. Greg Weiss ’05 and Matt Dank ’03 ap-
proached confidently. The group rushed to the awkward
contraption and scrambled up.

“Before we knew it, Lenko [Stefanov ’04] was already
at the top," said Umair Javed ’04 of his friend and fellow
student stair member No one had noticed tall, gangly
Stcfaiiov climbing ahead ofeveryone else. “We looked up
and there he was, iusrsltting there. . .He had baren aoouple
of really big guys, So Dave gets up and says, ‘Way to go
Lenka! He's 2t frikkin’ Lenko monkey!m

stefanov didn’t say anything; he simply grinned.

Laughter and personality

Since last Monday, May 5, when Stefanov was discov»
cred to have oommirred suicide, many ofhis friends, pro-
fossots and feiiaw student staff members have held Siefanov'x
smile and his contagious laugh tightly in their minds. “His
sense ofhumor was so suminctihe was more passive, not
very animated,” said iaved “Ifhe laughed you would jml
laugh because he was laughing. He
was just so much fun to be around."

The aim, collected nature diat
Stefanov combined with intelligence
and an understated sense of humor
causes many of his close friends to
poule over the eircumsranoes ofhis
death, “He seemed to have his life
straightened out," said laved. “This
guy had everything made for him
beans: he worked so hard at every
thing he did, I thought. Here's a guy
who can take mythingam loved has

ofEconomics since last August. but
was in close contact with Stefanov through phone tails
and email.

”We just had the greatest times together." said Javed.
“I think it shows how limited humans are in terms of what
we can do_we plan, and we think we'ie going to do this
and that—but there are so many forces rhar are beyond
our control." Like many others, Javed had no idea that
Stefanov was struggling so much. Just a week before he
died, Stefanov got in loud] with Javed to tell him about
room draw,

“He drew rooms next to each Other inYounker for us,"
said Javed. “He was so excited about that; he talked about
going to work out, going to parties—rust having a great
senior year .It's going to be so dilforentwithourhim."

Javed loved going to Harris parties with Stefanov be-
cause of the way he danced. “He had this funny dance that
he'd do He would you bop from side to side; he looked so
happy, He was such a terrible donccr.. .Evcry five minutes
he would push his glasses up; it was his trademark move."

“He had the krnd ofsmile that warmed your day," said
Amanda Prouty ’03. “it broke the serious look he had, the
storcism that he seemed to have." Stefanov served in the
military in Bulgaria before he me to Grinnell, bur he
didn't talk about it much. His posture was perfect, which
Prouty says drove her crazy, Hrs face was serious—except
when he laughed, which was often.

One of the first things Yosir Mehboob '03 remembers
about Stefanov was his laugh. "Nor everyone just comes
and laughs like that," he said. Stefanov’s laugh was quirky,
loud and a bit unruly, but also oonragious. “I used to hate
ir,..l used to think. Whats wrong with this guy?”
Mehboob said. Once he got [0 know Srcfanov, however,
he came to appreciate the animated laugh, realizing that
Stefanov's way ofshowrng his friendship was to laugh with
his friends. “You'd tell him the stupidest thing and he’d
just laugh; sometimes you weren't even trying to say some.
thing funny,” said Mehboob, “it takes a lot of eﬁort to
laugh like that, a lorofenergy"

Stefanov certainly had a serious side; he was academi»
rally driven and very career oriented, and he cared a lot
about his position as an SA and about the well—being ofhis
friends, “i felt like he always made time for things that
were important to him,” said Anik Covers '05. on SA in
Smith.“lt was sort ofuncannyehe seemed to have irazlin

balance. . .There was definitely so much more to him than
[amdemics] that was so subtle and powerful. . .He was so
good at taking stuffseriously while having fun with it."

Stefanov was an SA for two years, his sophomore year
on Dibble second and this year on Younkersetond North.
“I warehod him at group process [for student staffseiec»
tion]," said Prouty. “I knew he would be a great so. . .He
had an automatic connection with his ﬂoor."

“We have a tendency to get oilr topic," said Gevers.
“Lenka was always so much in me center ofrhe tearn. . ,but

enoe, but it wasn't like. ‘i need the spotlight on me' He
didn’t feel like he always needed to talk. But when e d,
you could tell that he had really thought about it."

Character and dignity

“Lenka and l hadaoommon friend, Umair," said Javed
Murad ’05, “His freshman year in Cowles. LGko and I
were sitting with some other people. . .I passed a comment
about Umair's girlfriend, and tenko got up and got very
angry with me. He said, ‘You shouldn't raik about him
behind his back. you how? we worked it out quickly,
but that incident made me tulire
that he rook his friendships very
seriously“ He ms really sincere
about everything he did.”

Murad told iaved about the in-
cident in Cowlts, because, as Javod
said, “Lenka wouldn’t con-re up [a

in addition to his friends,
Stefanov cared a lot for his family in
Bulgznat his mother Aneiigra, his
father Stefan and his 15»ye2r»ald
brother. “He was very close to his
family," said Javed. “He was very concered about his
brother's academic future. He made sure that he was learnt
ing English. Lenko had raughr himself English in eighth
grade orsomeshing."

“We reminisced a lot," said Prouty. “He missed the
smell of his home, his mom coming in to wake him up.
playing wirh his little brother."

loved remembers a photograph of stefanov with his
brother on the wall in Stefanov's room. "You could tell
from his body language that he was so caring,“ said Javed,
“He sort of had him in a headlock”

Murad and Stefanov shared a shift at the AV Center,
Although they frequently talked about their courses and
theirinternships and jobs in Manhatran and Boston, Murad
also remembers Stefanov talking about his life in Bulgaria,

“He spoke about how he wanted to help his family,"
said Murad. “It's so expensive to come to the US to study.
He spoke about how he wanted to make it big and then
give back to his family."

Stefanov's father has been withourwork forsevemlyears
and now has a diﬁicult time ﬁnding it because of his age;
the family doesn’t have a very large income. Lenka was
planning to save money this summer to help his family
buy a car. After his detrh a memorial fund was set up
through the Greek orthodox Church ofSr. George in Des
Moincst All donations to the fund will be sent to Stefanov’s
family in Bulgaria; because helping his family was so im»
porranr to Stefanov, some or his dearest friends feel that
supporting his family now is perhaps the best way to honor
Stefanov's memorya

Dedication and drive

As a first year at International student Orientation,
Javed heard about Stefanov; he knew d-iat he was from
bulgarla, that he was incredibly bright and rhar he planned
to major in economics. "One ofmy friends from Zambia
said ‘This guy is in my tutorial. Lenko; he’s just so smartl"
sald iaved. “We thought, ‘He's going to be our competi-
tor; yet he and I grew to be the best of friends and itst
supported each other."

“We rook micro economics with [Mark] Montgomery
together," said loved. “It was rather challenging No one
did very well on the first exam. For our second otsm, lenko
