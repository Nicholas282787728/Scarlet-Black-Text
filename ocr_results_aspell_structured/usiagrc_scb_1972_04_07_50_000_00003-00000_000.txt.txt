Speakers Highlight
Women’s Conference

Six days of films, speakers, n
guerilla theater group and a band
are being sponsored by the Grinnell
Women’s Movement under the title
of “Women, Men and Feminism: A
Symposium”. The symposium has
been designed to make the Grinnell
College community more aware of
the women’s liberation movement
and to examine its implications ior
both men and women,

The emphasis is not so much on
women’s liberation as it is on human
liberation. One goal oi the sympose
ium is to spark student interest in
the establishment at an abortion
fund and, possibly, the establish-
merit of a birth control clinic. The
Grinnell Women’s Movement does
not necessarily endorse abortion
or any other birth control method.
but only hopes to make all options
open to all men and womenbnihe
Grinnell campus.

The symposium will open on Sat-
urday afternoon, April 8, with two
workshops on ”The History of Fame
inism in Iowa” at l:00 and 3:00 in
the Religious Activities Room, Stei-
her. The workshops will be led by
Louise Noun who recently completed
a book on the subject, Strong-Minded
Women, Tsili Gandeiman who has a
background in sociology will also be

P resident meeting.

President in last week’s runoff.

Board Discusses RA Program

The JOlnt Board discussed his Res—
ident Adviser system with Assistant
Dean of students Jim Tederman
Wednesday night and decided to post-
pone specitic action for a week in
order to assess student opinion on
the issue

Dean Tederman suggested that the
RA system might be greatly im»
proved through 1) increased stu—
dent input in the interviewing pro~
cess and 2) better “education” and
support oi the RA's by both the
Dean's otiice and the Joint Board
at tlte beginning oi the year.

The chances tor abolishing the RA
system ior next year are slim be-
cause, as Tederman noted, much
time and money have been invested
in securing RA’S tor next year Con-
tracts are negotiated in the latter
part oi April, Tederman said, and
it is doubttul ii President Leggett
would agree to a proposal to abo-
lish the system this late.

The board passed H a resolution
to be iorwarded to the Humanities
EPC urging that EPC to increase the
number oi credits or independent
study a student may tttke in a single
department, A proposal brought to
the EPC which provided that the
restriction of 3 credits oi indepen-
dent slutty be litted tor all depart-
ments was deteated beroi-c break,
and Andrea Chapin, who brought the

proposal, was told by EPC members
that, in order to secure passage oi
the proposal, it be limited to the
Music, Theater and Art depart
merits.

in line with the decision of the new
SGA cabinet to divide responsibility
along the lines of their respective
areas or expertise, the Board passed
a recommendation to be forwarded to
the faculty that the President of SGA
be allowed to delegate one ofthe Vice
Presidents - Anne Walter ._ inpiace
ot himselt as voting member of the
All College EPC. The faculty deter»
mines which SGA official will have
the vote.

Most committees for next year will
be selected this spring in accordance
with another resolution passed by the
Board, Committee spots tor next
year's freshman will be opened if
some students selected this year de-
cide not to return. The rationale for
the action is to allow committees to
start working immediately next fall.

Student Auditor Greg Thielman re-
ported to the Board that there
remains over $2,000 in unused hall
funds. The exact balance for each
hall can be obtained from house
presidents or their representatives
who attended the meeting.

Wednesday’s meeting was the first
to be chaired by new Vice President

A recent gift to Grinnell Coll-
ege has made it possible to begin
work on the next major develop
mental phase oi the Henry 5. Cone
rad Environmental Research Area
Benjamin F. Graham, chairman oi
the Research Area Committee res
ported Wednesday.

The gilt of $0,000 has been made
for construction of a l4—acre lake
at the 3657acre research area loc-
ated ll miles southwest of the
college, in Jasper County. The (luiir
nor, who wishes to remain anony-
mous, was formerly a student of
Dr. Conrad’s at Grinnell, and chose
this means of paying tribute to the
highly respected teacher.

The lake, to be located on the
Southern half of the area, will be
retained by an earthen dam approx-
imately 350 feet long, and contain—
ing some 26,000 cubic yards oiear—
thfill, Mr. Graham Said.

in addition to the lake above the
dam, plans call tor the establish-
ment 0! 15 acres of marshy area
below the dam to add to the div-
ersin of habitat types available
for study.

when the area was undisturbed
several hundred years ago, Mr.
Graham said there was much more
wet land than at present, inhabite
ed by perhaps eight million heave
er. once the marshy landis tormed,
he said, “We hope to encourage
beavers to set up housekeeping out
there.“

A spigot on the dam will control
and maintain water levels in both
the lake and the marshy land.

United States Federal Soil Con-
servation Service Officials have been
“exceeding helpful" to the college
with the Conrad Research Area,
Mr. Graham said. They did the
preliminary survey and all the pie
anning for the dam and the lake,
and for earlier plantings of trees,
and prairie grass.

Since acquisition of the research
area in 1969 there has been a Cone
tinulng program oi removal of
interior fences, and cleaneup or 200
years accumulation of trash. In ad-
dition, nearly 8.000 trees and some
40 acres of native prairie grasses
have been planted, as well as some
300 specimen trees.

The natural attributes of the area
are numerous, including a large
deer herd, pheasant, quail, hawks,
owls, iox, possum, rabbits. ra-
ccun, squirrels, and an almost iii-
finite variety or insect, small mdmv
mal, bird, and plant species.

Goal: Keep Campus Unified

an informal interview, Cited the main

“No one can be faulted in particular
tar this communications breakdown;
however I do feel SGA can be helpful
in finding solutions." when asked
specitically how this was to be done,
Russ responded with the idea of hav-
ing an son page in the Campus Memo
whereby tile iaculty and students at
large will have some insight as to
the proceedings in SGA meetings.

Russ expects the cabinet setup, with
a distinct division of power between
the vice presidents, to be extremely
helpful, Anne Walter will deal with
academic issues and John Pfefter
will handle social and residential
matters.

Russ expressed the feeling that
SGA was not moving fast enough and
said, “We should move morequickly
but should be careful not to be reck-
less...” Speciticaliy Russ reterred
to issues like the EPC referendum,
the RA issue, the freshman orienta-
tion program, and the Career Sere
vices program.

“Another thing that bothers me in
a situation like this where tradition
has been foresaken is the fact that
a lot or people are torced to stay
here a full [our years when it is
entirely possible to graduate in
three or maybe two and a halt. Four
years is not a magic number.”

McGregor expressed concern over
whether or not we are actually living
up to our college image. “0iir‘cata»

logne image is quite attractive and
implies that upon graduation a thou-
sand doors Will open With unlilnited
opportunity. its not tl‘ue--and won’t
be until we really get Career Ser-
vices on the ball,”

Following the subject of images,
Russ noted that the Grinnell
Magazine is the single largest cone

tact with alumni, parents and friends
of the college and does an unusually
tine job of presenting as pretty a
picture as possible of the college,
but ”We don’t need to paint a pi-sttv

picture if it’s not." Russ fears that
those people who have been trying
to change things here and who have
not received coverage in the Grinnell
Magazine will be viewed as l‘ndir
cais and undesirable at the college.

Russ would like to come up with an
SGA alternative to the magazine. “I
want to prove that the people that are
lighting for change herc--those sup-
porting Nasser, the Associated Jew-
ish students, CBS, women's lib and
others-Anave the best interest of
this institution in mind.”

”Finally, personally, I believe in
making an siiort in trying the ime
possible-do please almost everye
body. That means not excluding one
complaint or considerable request.
1 think this can be a greal year for
Grinnell, there are good people
heading major positions and we all
want to help.”
