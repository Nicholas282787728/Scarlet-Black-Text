Professor William Case demonstrates his swing discovery in a Grinnell park

near the ends ofihe arc during the
swinging motion. not because they
raised their centers of mass when
they passed close to the ground.

Case and Swanson summarized
their research in a paper submitted
to thcAmerican Journal ofPhysicr
in 1988. According to Case, the
work was much resisted because it
conflicted with such a long-stand-
ing principle of physics.

“People did notexactly welcome
this new theory," Case said. “As
recently as 1970, most scientists

heargued, isalreadyevident. There
is already a shortage of math and
computer science faculty.
Fifty-five percent or engineer

universities currently go unfilled,

gincering, you (only) miss out on a

This bottleneck is the result of
several factors, including the aging
and retirement of present faculty,
the projected increase in the num-
ber of high school graduates, the
falling number of snidents finishr
ing graduate school and the loss of

were completelyconvinced thatyou
were able to pump a swing because
ofa parametric instability."

Now that Case's research has
finally been published. however, it
will change the way that the physr
ics of pumping a swing is taught in
classrooms around the world.

This isn’t the first timeCase has
taken issue with a physical theo
rem. Several years ago. he demon—
strated thata long-held explanation
for why a spinning gyroscope falls
down was over-simpliﬁed. The old

The major implication that this
hasforAmericancollegesisahigher
student-to-faculty ratio. Magnus
said,“everyone"inhighereducation
knows thatalowratio is needed for
quality teaching, but the faculty-
ratio concern is given little atten-
tion by the press.

A subtler but no less important
pattern is the increasing partner-
ship between business and the uni-
versities. TheSupremeCourt ruled
a decade ago that patentablc dis-
coveries made by university em.
ployees with university resources
belong to the university, not to in
dividual researchers. This means
that the university has the right to
use its discoveries in any way it
sees at, including the option oflir
ccnsing them to business for proﬁt.

The result has been the cmcrr
gence of what Magnus refers to as
thc“entrepreneurial university," as
opposed to the American ideal of
the intellectually free University.

explanation is still offered in basic
physics courses, but Case's new,
more accurate, explanation is taught
in intermediate physics classes.

While such discoveries are only
diversions from his mainlines of
research, Case admits to feeling
some satisfaction at having discov-
ered the physical explanation for
how to pump a swing,

research faculty to makepatentable
discoveries for Lhe enrichment of
the university. Then. in exchange
forincreasedfunding,theuniversity
allows a funding firm to use these
discoveries for its own purposes.

In effect. universities are coop-
erating with private firms to do
their research, development and
marketing. University-business
venture capital funding schemes
were an 58 billion industry in 1988.

Some ofﬁces of patents at uni»
versities "now routinely review
faculty research results to deter
mine their commercial signifi-
cance." Professors compromising
objectivity for increased benefits
and adminisu'ations basing evalu-
ations of faculty on productivity
are examples of the kind or things
thainowhappen. Magnus says that
numerous cases ofconflictofinter-
est have been documented.

To solve this problem. Magnus
proposes that faculty publicly dis-
close all business ties and that crir
tique of the "entrepreneurial uni-
versity“ should be stepped up.
