Domremy. listening to the marvelous
voices urging her to save France.
Though she longs for the quiet life of
the village mother, and is hurt at the
unkind words of the peasant woman
and the shrinking back of her chil—
dren, still she heeds the voices and
forms her lofty purpose with a vislun

persecution and flames before her.

tributed short stories. “A Toylanfl

Macy's War club and the pitching 0!
“Dick" Schultz were the main facmrs
in Simpson's downfall. The big center
fielder picked on a triple and a single
in four times up. and his blows drove
in tour of Grinnell's runs. Watt cal- -
lected the same variety of hits as
Macy. but his came without men on
the sucks. i.

Schultz again demonstrated that he
has a world of stuff, and at all times
he had the ”Simps” at his mercy.
They made four hits in the first ﬁve
innings, and never saw flrst base a!-
ter that. “Dick" struck out eleven
men. walked two, and hit one.

Simpson's run came in a rather pe-
culiar manner in the second frame.
