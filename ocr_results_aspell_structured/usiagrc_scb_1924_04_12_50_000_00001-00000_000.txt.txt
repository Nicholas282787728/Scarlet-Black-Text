Convention of Economists and
Sociologists Brings Well-
known Speakers Here.

The seventh annual conference of
the Iowa Association of Economics
and Sociologists, held here yesterday
and today brought to Grinnell repree
sentatives of twenty-five of the col-
_leges and universities of the state.

FRIDAY momma

In an informal, yet highly interest-
ing and instructing address before the
Opening session held yesterday after-
noon, John E. Brindley of Iowa state
College of Ames explained the orgaib
izhtion and administrative features of
the budget and taxation revision bill
now pending before the Iowa legis—
lalure.

The reconh‘h‘l‘endatious of the tax
commission as outlined by. Professor
Brindley provides for (1), the abol-
ition oi the local assessor, (2)
abolition of the review board, (3) the
creation of an appointed county 213*

' sessor, and lastly, the creating of an
appointed county review board. This
plan, according to the professor,
would be the first step in tax reform
in this state Since the Old statute of
of ISSI was first put into effect, and
.untler uhich the stale Still operates.
rnrru Bloc Oppose Measure

it is especially interesting to note
that the farm bloc in Iowa politics
is so opposed to the reform measure
which i ll so greatly reduce ta 's
on all farin‘ land, something for which
the farmers have constantly clamor—
ed. just because of the lack of infor—
nliation and because of misinformation,
end also of the fear or autocracy in
a centralized tax control body. One
of the most important amendments
of the senate to the bill was that pro—
vision creating R. state budget hoard
with appellate functions to which the
people may appeal in forcing honesty
in the making and the executing of
contracts. '

Professor Brindley believes that the
measure as it was recommended to

With the return of warm weather a

The track is ln excellent shape for so

“Failure to support the 'church

The church today is just influ—
ential as the medieval church was,
Miss Knight stated, It has a ‘right
to demand our loyabty. In the church
we find friendship and loyalty as well
as inspiration.

Alice Soelberg,
student speaker,
she said, is asmuch interested in what
you want to be as in what you believe
in. One cannot afford solitude in any
profession. No more can he afford to
live in spiritual solitude. "We are a
part of a great whole," concluded Miss
Soelberg, "But thereare many gaps
to be filled. in the church we can
find the material to bridge these gaps.
H is our duty and our privilege to
use this matrrial,"

viewpoint of local church members.
It stimulates and encourages the older
members and renews their faith in
students.

One advantage of church attendance
lies in meeting people as a commun-
ity. The college student’s world is
apt to be limited to his own canipus.
This community association broadens
his sympathies and keeps this view-
point normal.

. Through the auspices of the church,
fine music, drama, and lectures are
given to its members. ,

“The rcal point of this meeting,”

work is dedicated jointly to David E.

It is possible that Griunell may be

istudehts to Be Required to Use

Good English In All Writ»
ten Work.

Pursuant to a votc of the faculty, a
committee on the Use of English by
students has been constituted to deal
with those studcnts who are guilty of
gro s illiteracy iri’tlleil' writtcu work.

No longer will the tare-free Senior
who writes “had went" and “them‘s
them" be able to esacpe on the plea
that he has “had" freshman English
and consequently is free ever after to
express himself as he pleases,

In the future any student whose
writing is grossly inaccurate in the
elements of grammar and composition,
no matter in what department of the
college he is registered, may be re-
ported by his instructors to the come
mittee on the Use of English by Stu-

dents. l
No one Will be disturbed because his

writing is not done in a beautiful style
or in a classic manner; but any one
who disregards the elementary rules
of the English language is likely to
find himself reported to the commit-
tee. Tbis committee, which will con-
sist of Professors wood, Spencer, and
Rutherford, will consider the war-ls of
each student who is so reported; it
will assign such additional English
instruction as may be necessary; and
it may place him under a condition
until he shows improvement. This
work will not be done in class but will
be in the form of individual tasks as
signed in conference by instructors in
the English department, The standards
used throughout will be such as any
business house might apply to its ena—
ployecs.

The whole plan is not a new one but
is almost the same as that adopted
here in 1917 which, on account of the
war disturbance at that time, could
not be put into effect. It is the same
plan which practically all of the best
colleges now have in operation and
is modeled after that, used at Harvard,
the first college to do this. it goes
into effect immediately.
