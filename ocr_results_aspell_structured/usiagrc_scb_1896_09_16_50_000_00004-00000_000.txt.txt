Football Outlook.

With the opening of college the
interest along the line of athletics
is at course centered in football.
Few of thc Call(ll(li\[t‘\‘ answered
the call otCaptarn Tcrnplcman to
report bcfor'c the opening of col-
lcgc little has been clone by

, which a line can be drawn on the

prospects for this season. The
old men art: all well known. Tcm-
plernan, Armstrong and Gray of
last year's ’varsity are all trying
[or their old positions and ought
to play a iuriousgame. Coggc-
shall and Sargent are both unable
to play on account or parental obr
jcction, Macartncy will make a
trong man for either half or
quarter.

Last year's arm/b men are much
in evidenc.. Reuu Douglass,
Wiley, thclcr, Crary, Molir,
Haincs. Norris, Marsh and Knapp
have all donned their football
clothcs for another season. chr
eral of them from their work of
last year give piornisc ot becom~
ing very fast players. It is rather
early tor much to be said about
the new men. They have had no
opportunity to show the stuff they
are made otr Turner, Lindsay
and Capron have all been out
two or three evenings and their
work is tall or promise. This is
the time for the Grinuell spirit to
manifest itself.
The team that will represent

this year will be composed
largely oi new men. There
arc scveral open positions and
there is a chance ior everyone
who has inclinations in that direc-
tion to make a place for himself
ontheioothallteaniof'gé. From
this time on let every one who
possibly can do so, be on the ﬁeld
and help what he can. Thursday
evening should see two {all teams
at work. Don't stay back from
lack ot knowledge of the game.
Plenty of coachers will be pros
vidsd till the regular conch takes

The New Grand Sland.

Duiing the summer a new gi and
stand l‘liH been erected in Athletic

of '95 who have done ycoinan ser

in Athletic Park are McCowau.
