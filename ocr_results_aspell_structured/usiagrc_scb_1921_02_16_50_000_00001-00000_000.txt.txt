by people of modeiate nlcans.to whom
the cost of a college education under
present conditions seems to present
great obstacles. By starting a little
early the coll’ege education can be
financed'without trouble or anxiety.
Many people now. when their chil-
dren are born, lay aside a certain
amount for education. This partial
payment plan carries this idea; one
step farther and puts a college 'edu—
cation r thin the reach of anyone who
‘uill save inst a little.
. To Sun-t Trust Company

The Bankers Trust Company . of
Gr'innell is another integral part of
Mr. Norrls’ idea It is to be formed
in recognition of lite lit-‘1 LllJt . .v
business men are new helping dee
‘scl'ving young m"e11 through college
lftnd are more ready to give in such
la cause than to the college in the aha
stract. The plan calls for the forma—
tion or such a company, headed by
men of recognized authority in bank-
ing circles, which shall be authorized
to accept and adnpnistcr trusts. to
receive moneys or properties on cer-
tificate of deposit and to»issue its col-
lateral tr~nst certificates to investors,
but not to do a current checking ac»
count business. It shall have as its
purpose the loaning‘oi‘ money to
students in Grinnell College “who are
lill need of assistance and it shall res
ceive and administer all funds en.
trusted to it for that purpose. Money
ltleposited in the Bankers Trust Coin-
pany of Griuncll will perform the
dual service of paying a 4 per cent
interest income to investors during
their lives and of giving worthy young
people a college education in Grinnell.
The funds in this‘trust company, in
.thc words or Mr. Non s, “would he
loaned to young Articricans to make
more manly men."

Church to Take Part

The third section of thc plan is (or'
.the presentation to the Congregation-
al church societies of this and ad
oiuing states the proposition or en-
dowing scholarships in Grinncll Col-
lege, each society to name the person
or persons who shall receive the ben-
efit of the generosity thus extended.
This will link the churches more
closely to the college with which they
have always been closely allied but
which they have never been asked to
aid financially as churches of other
denominations have been called upon
to aid their colleges. It will give
them an interest in the college which

cannot be obtained in any other way
