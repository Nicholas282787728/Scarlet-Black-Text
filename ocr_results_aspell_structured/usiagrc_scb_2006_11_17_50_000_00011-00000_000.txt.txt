Men’s cross country team falls short at 'Regionals

Team fails to advance but sends two
runners to compete as individuals at
Nationals

BYE” BEST

The Grinnell Men's cross eounrry ream competed together
for the last time this season last Saturday at the Central Res
gionals in Northfleld, Minn. The Pioneers narrowly missed
consideration {or qualiﬁcation as a team to Nationals but will
be represented in individual competition by Drake Ballew ’08
and David Montgomery '10,

The Pioneers ﬁnished sixth in the team standings, batters
ing their 2005 finish by four spots, but missed a shot at being
considered for an at—laige Nationals bid by a single position.
Nonetheless, coach Will Freeman was pleased with the results.

“I feel great about how the men mu,” Fieeman said. “Vi/e
knew we were up against some very ﬁne schools."

The five schools that ﬁnished ahead of Grinncll are all
ranked in the top 16 nationally. Hamline won the meet by place
ing three runners in the top 10. Rounding out the top five were
Luthei,Wartburg, St.]ohn’s (l\/linn.) and Nebraska Wesleyan.

Women's soCcer

BY NATE LINDSEY

The women's soccer team drew first blood Saturday against
Augustana, and it looked for most ofthe game that they would
move on to the second round of the national tournament. But a
penalty kick in the 72nd minute set in motion a two goal coinc-
back for Augustana, who went on to beat the Pioneererl,

Grinnell got on the board early, as Katherine Ni '09 found
the back of the netjust 14 seconds into the match offan assist
from Miki Nakamul'a '10.

The Pioneers controlled the ball during the ﬁrst half and
into the second before a suspect call in the box led to thc Vi—
kings first goal.

“There was a call right on the edge of the box that maybe
wasn't in shooting range that eould have been a call or no call,"
Kate Diedrick '07 said. “It was unlucky and it happens to the
best teams, but the penalty kick didn’t lose the game for us, it
just started us on a downward spiral."

That downward spiral of bad luck continued in the 84th

Gr-inncll's rttnners were generally ' trod despite the sting
ofjust missing out in the team eomperi on.

“We felt good about our sixth place finish," Ballew, who
earne rn nine seconds off of the winning pace to finish third,
said. “It was a confirmation for us that oui training was exactly
where it needed to bc "

Montgomery, who finished 15th, praised
his teammates. “A lot of guys had persone
al bests," he said. “I thought we ran really
strong as a team."

Nebraska Wesleyan's Chris Dunkcr
topped the competition, running the eight
kilometer course in 25:37. He was followed
closely by Hamline’s Travis Bristow and
Ballew, Ballcw and Montgomery will come
petc for the Pioneers at the National meet tomorrow in Mason,
Ohio:

The mood going into the weekend it that of antierpatron
and confidence. “I'm excited about getting another shot at
Dunkcr and Bl‘lStOW this coming weekend," Ballew said.

Both Ballew and Montgomery emphasized the need to run
a “smart race" against what will be a high-caliber field,

”This is a very/young, but very

talented, team. Nextyear wi/l be

a gteatseaxan foI this group.
Coach Will Freeman

As Ballew and Montgomery prepare for next weekend, the
team is looking ahead to the 2007 season with high aspira-
tions.’l'he Pioneers will not lose any oftheir top eight runners
to graduation. “This is a very young, but very talented, team,"
Freeman said. “Next year will be a great season for this group.“

Montgomery agreed. “I think as a team we should not only
be thinking about making Nationals next
year, but plaeing well there'he said.

Among those returning next season is
Henry Reich ’09, who earned All-Region
honors with his 35th place ﬁnish this past
weekend.

The Pioneer men look to the success of
the women, who won Regronals and qual'r
fied for Nationals this season, and hope to

follow in their footsteps next year. Freeman thinks that is pos»
sible, and Ballew agreed

“lfwe avoid injury and sickness and stay committed to the

tlaining, there’s no doubt that we have the ability to win the
region next year and do very well at the national level," he said,
“Whether or not that will happen rs completely within our
control,"

The match was the final game for seniois Diedrick, Ra»

seniors saw three Midwest conterenee Championships, three
tournament titles and three national tournament appearances

experience, this has been exactly what we would want for this
year," Allison said. "It's a great season to end [my career with]."

Diedrick agreed this season was the team’s strongest, de-
spite it not going further rnto the national tournament.

“We really want to do better every season, Diedrick said.
“[Bnr] in a way we went further than last year because we ac-

complished oui other goals, which were shutouts and going
undefeated in conference."

women’s soccer team and knowing it has a winning legacy and
a good future ifthcy commit to being the best they can.
