BY Martens EAGAN

For the Grinnell woinens Basketball team, in past ycars, the ﬁnal

ognize the career accomplishments of the outgoing senior athletes. This
year’s senior Day was against Monmouth last Saturday/ill]: team's sea-
son finale—and the lone senior in the spotlight was less Shotts ‘10.

“I just think she is an incredible leader, incredible basketball player
and.t.thc girl can shoot the ball," Michelle Briggs '13 said.

Although the team lost their ﬁnal away game ot’the 2009-2010 season
against Knox last Thursday ind despite their final record ofS-lS (3-13 in
MVVC) members of the team remain optimistic about the future. They
also know/Jess Shorts the leading—scorer and team captain. will be missed

“To characterize this [seasons] team, even though we clout have a lot
otwms, I still think it has been a pretty successful year; Shorts said. We
have definitely gotten stronger in the weight room, we’ve played better on
defense, and we can stay in close games—we would get blown out by 20
points ltlSl year. "

Head Coach Kate Glucltunan, while acknowledging that rhe team
could have won more games. also reiterated a central leasoll why the mem-
hets otrhe Women's Busherhull team partlcipatex in college basketball.

“I had fun with [the team] this year, and they had full with each other,”
Gluclcrnan curd. “I also liked being in close gnmes, and we didn'Lwin some
of those, but being there, that’s exciting. that's fun, that's why we play."

Shorts even impressed snideutearhlctes on other teams, and set an ex-
ample for other teams leaders. Ross Preston 10. for example, the captain
orthe mens sqrud had something to say of Shotrs contributions, citlng
her tenacity

“The thing I loved about watching Shotts play was that she always
wanted in on the action," Preston said.

The coach described the season as "The Tale of a Lot of First- -Yeats,”
and the Lone Senior.

[Shorts] played Like I wanted her to play, while [the first years] gor
the experience I wanted them to get, ”Gluckman said.‘ ‘lt was sort oflike a
changing of the guards. . .and that’s not to say that our juniors and sopho-
mores were not there because they were."

Looking ahead, Coach Glutkman said that she was excited aboutJesr
sica Vaverka ’11 (Center), who earned a starting point near the season’s
conclusion, Mallory Scharf‘ll (Formtd) and Brianna Gallo '11, who will
start at point guard for the Pioneers next season,

"I think that this year was a learning year and deﬁnitely a ‘building
ycat,'but it was also exciting," Glucknian said. “It was sort of the first step
towards where we’re going, with my ﬁrst incoming class of recruits being
here."

This year’s team acmrlly won one more game than last year’s team,
and won tough conference contests against Ripon, Beloit and Knox Col»
