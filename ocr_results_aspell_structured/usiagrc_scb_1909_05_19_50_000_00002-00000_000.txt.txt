Neataear at Commencement. ,
Gi'innell has this year been making
a special appeal to the undergraduate

to remain in town ior- Commencement
week and by bringing in a Commence»
ment speaker or national reputation,
she has assured her-selt a larger num»
her of out oi town guests at that time
than has previously been the case. it
is now ”up to" her to give those un.
oer-graduates who remain in tonn and
possible visitors a good rnrpression to
store awar' in their rnerory and label»

dignity or the Commencement 9.
cises, the drrty which the faculty owes
the class which may happen to be grad-

College should dictate more care along
