New curriculum guides being studied

by L. Carter

_Several proposals, including a
comprehensive guide designed by
Parker Professor of History Alan
Jones, have been received bythe
Curriculum Committee, followmg"
the faculty’s decision late last
semester to send the Parslow Cur»
riculum Proposal to the commit-
tee for further study. An interim
report on these recent suggestions
will be presented at the faculty
meeting next Monday and a set of
the committee's recommenda-
tions is expected sometime after
Spring Break.

The committee, composed of
five faculty members, four
students, Associate Dean of the
Faculty Donald Irving and headed
by Dean of the Faculty Catherine
Frazer, was charged by the iacul-
ty with investigating the staffing
implications of the Parslow Pro
posal and soliciting and
evaluating modifications or alter-
natives to it.

According to Rosenthal Pro»
fessor of Humanities Philip Kint-
ner, the Social Studies Division
representative on the committee,

faculty members from each of the
college’s three academic divisions
have submitted ideas on the cur-
riculum to the committee, Kintner
added, however, that only pro-
pusals and ideas presented by the
Social Studies Division have pro
vided more than amendments to
the scheme designed by Cur-
riculum Coordinator Morris
Parslow.

Suggestions for curricular
change have been received from
Social Studies Division members
Assistant Professor of Philosophy
Paul Tang, Assistant Professor of
History Randolph Roth and Pro
lessor Jones in response to a re»
quest by Kintner for reactions to a
required junior or senior level in-
terdisciplinary seminar proposed
by Jones and Professor of An
thropology Ronald Kurtz, While
Tang’s response deals specifically
with such a seminar for Social
Science majors and the reaction
by Roth is concerned primarily
with the freshman tutorial, Jones‘
proposal expresses ideas for cur»
ricular change encompassing all
divisions and class levels.

Iowa caucuses
come to Grinnell

by Ellen Piekalkiewiez

The Democratic Iowa Caucuses
areslated for Feb. 20at8p.m.and
area Democrau are working hard
in order to minimize participation
in them.

Nikki Moore, head of the cams
pus Democrats, said her group
will be doing the following to en-
courage student attendance:

- Delivering a packet on die
Democratic candidates to all
registered voters on campus.

- Holding a voter registration
drive.

- Conducting a poll of
registered campus voters asking
them if they will be attending the
caucuses and who meir presiden-
tal preference is."

- Providing transportation to
the caucus locations.

Kevin Crim, one or the two
chairpersons of the Poweshiek
Democratic Central Committee,
said the county will be holding a
mock caucus Saturday from 12-2
p.m. at the Veteran’s Memorial
Building on the Southeast corner
of 4th and Broad Streets. Lunch
will be served ior 52 and there will
be live entertainment, he added.

Crim said it would be a good
idea for students to attend this
mock caucus because “a caucus
can be sort of foreboding... but
lots of fun”,

Good organization is the key word
in all these preparations at all
levels. Jon Hurwitz, Lecturer in
Political Science, explained
“Caucus states put a premium on
organization because it is difficult
to get people to give up an entire
evening (to attend the caucus)...

in a caucus you are notjust trying
to get the people to vote for a cer-
tain candidate but trying to_make
them particiapte and persuade
them it is wormwhile.”

He added, “candidates that are
much better organized will do bet
term because they get their sup

porters to attend the caucuses,
“That is why (candidate Walter)
Mondale is expected to do so
well. ”

Mondale, who was the first per»
son to declare his candidacy tor
the Democratic nomination had a
big advantage in organization,

, Hurwitz said.

”Mondale can utilize existing
campaign organizations from the
Cartescampaign oi ms." in addir
tion, Hurwitz, said, “Mondale got
important endorsements, which is
significant because it allowed him
to tap someone else's organiza-
tion... promising everyuiing to
everyone pays off.”

Area Democrats hope ior a
large turnout at the caucuses, but
Hurwitz said, “It is a foregone
conclusion that the turnout will be
lower than expected and the level
of enthusiasm is certainly down."

He added, “The only excitement
is in the race for second place"
since Mondale is definateiy going
to win by a large margin.

However, Hurwitz cautioned,
”The competition is iairly signifi-
cant because the candidate who
wins second place will be entering
the New Hampshire primary with
a great deal of momentum."

All students living on campus
are in Grinnell’s first ward, where
the caucus will be held at the Fair
View School. In the Second Ward
the caucus will take place at the
High School, in the Third Ward at
Uncle Sam‘s Club, and in the
Fourth Ward at the Davis School.

In the First Ward, where four
years ago. 275 people attended, 20
delegates to the County
Democratic Convention April 7
will be elected. Kevin Crim, said,
“I expect a fair portion of the
caucus will be made up of
students."

He added, “the students at the
caucus will get the appreciation
they deserve... and it is a good
possibility students will be elected
as delegates.”

Jones described his proposal as
both ”a way of thinking about Cur-
ricular change and what Grinnell
Curriculum should aim at,” His
suggestions are not intended to
serve as specific or concrete pro»
posals, he stressed, but should
provide “illustrative ideas that
other divisions could pick up on."
Jones believes that Grinnell
should, as many other institutions
are currently doing, move back to
minimal graduation requirements
lrom the present open curriculum
which he termed a product of “the
milieu of the late '605 and early
'70s”

in taking this step, however, he
emphasizes that changes in Grinr
nell’s curriculum must be pure
poseful. “if we're going to have
requirements, they should be
deSlgned with specific aims in
mind," Jones stated. Rather than
a “broad distribution require
ment” such as that featured in the
Parslow Proposal, he iavors
“courses designed with purposes
appropriate to a graduation re-
quirernenf."

BHM speakers on Chicago

by Patrizia Westiield

“Chicago set the nation on its
heels,” remarked Joyce Tucker,
Director of the Illinois Deaprb
merit oi Human Rights at a dual
lecture Monday in South Lounge.
At the well~attended presentation,
this statement was iurthered by
the second speaker, Dr. Charles
Branham, in his discussion of
Black Politics in Chicago.

February has been declared
Black History month, and in honor
oi the occasion speakers Tucker
and Branham were asked to speak
to Grinnellians.

Introduced by Laveta Small,
Director of Minority Affairs.
Tucker began her speech with a
personal query, “How does one
cope with being a Black
Republican in Chicago?” The
answer, of course, was “with
great difficulty."

Tucker’s career actually
started when she filed discrimina-
tion charges. Planning to become
a lawyer, Tucker decided to
represent herself, and won her
case. Remembered for her
deiense, Tucker was asked to be
interviewed for a position in the 11-
linois Department of Labor Rela-
tions.

From there she was given her
own department that of Equal
Employment Opportunity. Accor~

posal many goals that he believes
would be appropriate and which
might draw on the existing
resources and the traditional and
present purposes oi the college.
included are die goals oi certain
quantitative skills. writing ability.
a sensibility of scientific inquiry,
social consciousness of contemr
porary problems and a sensitivity
to the fine arts. in order to achieve
these educational goals at Grin—
nell. Jones suggests requirements
of eight credits in the areas of
mathematics and science,
humanities and the arts, and
social and historical studies.

The present ceiling on faculty
size o[ 105 imposed by the Board oi
Trustees reduces the plausibility
oi a science requirement such as
the eight credits at one lab science
proposed by Parsiow However.
Jones proposes that science
courses without labs could meet
the requirement thereby onset
ting somewhat the stall shortage.

Staffing limitations would also
make an arts requirement and a
two-year foreign language re
quirement difficult to implement,

ding to Tucker, her position did
not last long, as the department
was being merged with two others

to form the Department of Human'

Rights. Given the opportunity to
coordinate the merger, Tucker ac
cepted. The governor then asked
Tucker to head the department,
whereupon she became the first
black woman in Illinois history to
serve as a member of the Illinois
cabinet.

Tucker also discussed her
friendship with Harold
Washington, Mayor of Chicago
and Reverend Jesse Jackson,
Democratic presidential can-
didate. [Being an appointee of a
Republican government, Tucker
is obligated to keep her relation
ship with democrats Jackson and
Washington apolitical. Tucker
sees the “need for blacks to be
both Republicans and
Democrats." Otherwise, there is a
good chance that they will be fur
ther locked out or the political proA
cess.l Concerning Washington’s
candidacy tor mayor, Tucker had
to remain behind the scenes in ac-
cordance with her official posi
tion, She believed this to be ﬂ’le

"best way in order to be me to

herself and loyal and effective to
her boss.

Today, Jackson is running for
president and Tucker must again
keep her support unoiiicial. She
indicated she is prepared to do
this, as she left the podium saying,

Jones admits, although he
believes both should be included
in the Grinnell curriculum. Jones
expressed the hope “that the
faculty would move toward a
more innovative curriculum and
the trustees would respond by ac-
commodating the needs created
by the curricular changes.”

Jones provided another alter
native to the Parslow Proposal
that would ensure that Grinnell
students graduate having taken a
minimum number of courses in
each of the Science, Humanities
and some] Studies divisions.
Tacked on to the end of his prt}
posal are suggestions that the
maximum number of credits a
student may take in one division
be reduced from 92 to 84 and that a
minimum of 16 credits in each
division be required. Calling these
suggestions “a little subversive"
and declaring that “I don’t have a
lot of faith in them," Jones stated
that these options could be exer-
cised if no other curricular
changes could be devised to
assure that some minimum re-
quirements are met {or a Grinnell
degree,

Charleu oranhum. who spoke
on Chicago politics.

“I have learned the art of delicate
compromise."

Dr. Charles Branham spoke
next on the theme of Black
Politics in Chicago. starting at the
turn of the century, Branham
documented the history of Blacks
in Chicago Politics to present
time.

Declaring John Jones the
founder of Black Chicago and
Earl Dickerson the Father of
Black Politics, Branham went on
to mention many other important
black leaders.

Trustees-—- discuss fees

by .ieit Raymond

During their meeting today, the
Board of Trustees of the College
are expected to approve a higher
comprehensive fee for next year,
according to President George
Drake.

The fee now stands at $9,240. up
about six percent from last year.
Drake said that he did not know
how much the trustees would
raise the level next year.

“We ice] that for the quality,
there's room to go up," said
Drake. He noted that financial aid

will also rise to meet the increas-
ed demand of Students on finan-
cial aid. Grinnell is currently
about seventh among the 13 ACM
schools in price.

The trustees will also meet with
members of the Faculterrusteos
Relations Committee, which
serves as a liaison between the
faculty and the Board. The Com~
mittee will be presenting a paper
on excellence in Grinnell among
the iacult’y '

Among the topics discussed
specifically in the paper are in4
