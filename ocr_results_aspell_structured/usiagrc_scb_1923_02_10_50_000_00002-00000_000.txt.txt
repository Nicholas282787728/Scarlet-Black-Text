”The Social Aspect or the Chris-

tlll‘e by Prof. Shallel' Mathews.

Mathews, cunsists of the vialation of

the moral system which the Hebrews

significance to the Hebrew concepr

to emphasize the important part which
authors play in our modern physical
and spiritual life. Declaring the pop-

read on rncts from contemporary
authors and poets to show that there
is spiritual vision in the literary pro—

religion merge into each other was
the thought which he expressed in
conclusion.

Professor O'Concv answered ques-

PROF. .l. D. 5TO0Ps.

Pror, J.. D. Stoops discussed 'tl‘ut-
ting Soul into the World" at the 10:40
session Thursday. A large number of
the vi ting ministers as well as a
gathering of students heard the lcce
ture. Professor Stoops dealt with the
materialism current in the recent
make-up of the peoples of the world.

“The outer world,” Prciessor Stoops
declared. “is threatening to become
the only real world, and the inner
world is being crowded out.‘_’ The
speaker suggested that we quit
thinking of science as an enemy of
religions and morality as one means
or correcting the abnormal vicissis
tud which are daily threatening to
make tile. materialistic World the only
real world.

A large portion of Pl'ufessor Stoop’s
speech dealt with the relation of scie
ence to religion, and the seeming Icon-
ilict between the two, which is really
not a conflict at all. The iunctlon
of religion, he suggested. is not to
combat with science but to use scie
once as a means of giving us control
over nature

FIF’I‘II GATES MEMORIAL LEC-
TUBE

"The Social Aspect of the Christian
Doctrine of the Atonement" was the
subject of the fifth Gates Memorial
lecture. ‘1“ opening Professor Maine
ews declared that the Christian doc-
nine of the atonement is the best
example of the tree response of theo~
logical thinking to social experience.

Leading up to a historical treat-

ment of this doctrine he discussed‘l

the present attitude of forgiveness

In all the shifting oi values and the.

building ilp or mortality, few people
think or the justice or forgiveness and
try to locale it in their scheme of
things. We want people to iorgive
ils but we do not want to forgivetheni.

However we believe in n God who is_

the basis of custom, morality and
right and who forgives. Although the

moral motive oi the protection of so. ‘
ciety lies at our hitsis of revenge, a~

great contradiction stands between
righteousness and the desire of tor-
givencss for ourselves and willing-
ness to forgive others. The/question
is how are we to bring those two
together and rvoiessor Mathews says
that the solution lies in the Christian
doctrine of the atonement.

Ill order to show the development
of dittercnt theories of the atonement
with the cllztngihgrsociitl conditions
oi the ages he launched into a bi
torloal treatment of the same pau,
log at intervals to comment on the
trend and signiﬁcance of these then-
ies. According to Professor Mathews
the atonement was ﬁvst considered
as a sucriiicc, in the middle ages as
analogous to a l‘mlSUYI, and later as
a solisinciioit or God's honor in the

of his paper was to discuss whether
the Church’s doctrine 0! sin has any
bearing on the state's doctrine or
crime.

A lcttge part of Rev. MrsPel‘lillI's
address had to do with his experience
in the prison ztlld with the State’s
doctrine of sin (ind foragiveness. AS
he explained them, the doctrine Elf the
Church and that of the State have few
similarities. This condition can hard—
ly be relieved, he declared. The
church does not ostracise ol' snub the
man wimlin its walls who has been
convicted of being at party to it come
bination operating in the restraint of
trade, but will hardly accept a man
who is a drnnkard. Forgiveness for
the former sin is extended sooner
than for the latter. 7

"Sin, disease Valid crime are all
closely interrelated," Rev. Perkins dice
clared in discussing the relation of
each to the other. He proceeded to
give body to this declaration by glv—
ing examples encountered in the state
prison while he was its Warden. Rev.
Perkin’s address was the closing ad-
