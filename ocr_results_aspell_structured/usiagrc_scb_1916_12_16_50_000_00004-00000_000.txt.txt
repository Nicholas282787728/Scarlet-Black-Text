under the leadership of the Grille
ilell lodge or Elli.

'i‘h‘ is the program which lies ahead
at o nnoll tor the big Community
Christmas celebration n week. Cut
it out and keep it; tor t will be re-
ierred to treoucntly during the come
ing week.

The progiams will be centered about
the two big Christmas trees, one at the
corner oo Fourth avenue and Broad
street, and the other at the corner or
Fourth avenue and Main. it the throng
is too large about one tree, those who
are crowded out can enjoy the pro—
gi am at the other.

The entertainment arranged is on a
larger scale than that or last year.
More people will participate but the
spirit will remain the same; the spirit
of Merry Christmas burning clear and
bright for every single person in Grin-
nell and, the country round about.

The week’s celebration will reach its
climax in the community singing on
Saturday evening, which is being or»
galiized by the Grinnell lodge ot Elks
as its contribution to the celebration.
The detailed plans tor this big cele—
bration are elaborated elsewhere in
this issue.

All the piograms will begin prompts
ly at 7 o'clock, and will last. for about
half an hour.
