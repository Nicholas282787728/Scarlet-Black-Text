Jun]or--Freshman Reception.

The annual'reception, tendered
by the junior to the freshman class
last evening, at the hospitable
home of Professor and Mrs. Main.
was one of the most enjoyable as
well as elaborate parties of its
kind held in Grinnell for several
years.

The various rooms were taster
fully decorated with Chinese lane
terns, tans and parasols, and occlr
dent and orient met in friendly
greeting as the Chinese Iegation,
in their quaint native costumes, re-
ceived the ambassadors and min-
isters plenipotentiary of all na»
[ions with their ladies.

Each of the diplomatic repre»
sentatives upon his arrival was
omciously announced by a genus
ine “Sambo,” imported direct from
the south for the occasion.

The regular program ot the even-
ing consisted of a grand prome»
nade, national air-s, joss house, tee
freshmentsand music, partners be
ing secured tor each number.

The grand promenade was led
by the Chinese legaticn, and fol-
lowing them came the representa-
tives from every land and cirme in
their native court costumes, The
imperious Napoleon accompanied
by the Ernpressjosephrne; Thom.
as Jefferson and wife, with their
saucy_maid, Topsy; the rantastic
native twins from the South Sea
Islands; the runny Esquimaux
from the Polar region; the sivarthy
Indians from the western plains;

Besides these Russians, Turks,
Italians, Frenchmen, Germans,
Scotch. Englishmen and Anrcri.
cans of every type and character
passed by in a gay and goigcous
throng,

Considerable entertain nicnl was
furnished by the attempt to guess
the various national airs as they
were played. Some of the am-
bassadors, strangely enough, did
not seem to be familiar with the
songs of their native land.

The loss House was especially
replete with amusement. Here
the guests had an opportunity of
displaying tolenrism, and
pay homage before the shrine of
the great and all~p0weiilll dragon
and also experience the allrper~
vading “fang shill," which stir-
ronnds the divinity of Chinese
shapes. The prize ottered for the
one guessingthe lulgest number
of curios in the loss liouse collec»
tion was won by Prof, Emery.

one long to be remembered by

those in attendance.

Grinnell Institute.

The last of the series of class
programs was given by the Fresh-
man last Wednesday evening,
The program. though rather long,
was plcrrreously interspersed wiih
music, and was entertaining and
instructive throughout.

Van Hocsen opened the exerr
cises with a story—an Irishmaii’s
version of a ﬁght between David
and Goliath. The Irishtiian’s ins
lerpielation of the biblical event
was extraortlitiriiy,

then rendered a
pleasing instrumental duet for the
society.

Burn ide read two short seleCr
tions, “The Bad Man of Las Ver
gas" and “Bread and Butter.”
Both were racy, interesting stor»
res, one of lite on the plains, the
other of life in the city.

Two more vocal selections were
rendered by Miss Courtney, tor
geihei- with a third, which long
applause demanded.

Geo. Arnold gave a talk on the
Claytoanuliver treaty and the
Nicaraguan canal. Arnold is a
new man arid this was his ﬁrst ap-
pearance. He showed caretul
previous reading and had a good
delivery. His talk was instruc-
live.

The question for debate was
“Resolved, that the attitude of
the United States towards the
Philippines is justrﬁabie. Spaul»
ding asserted that the Filipinos
are ignorant, warlike and a men-
ace to civrlrzation; that they owe
us the islandsin return for Dewey’s
act; and that our present attitude
will piomote justice.

Dickinson denied that our pres-
ent policy is justiﬁable. We are
forcing a government upon them
winch rs tar lrom pertect, as is
shown iti our treatment of the In»
dians, Kentucky‘s disgraceful af-
fairs, condition of factory hands,
etc. If we can’t govern ourselves,
we certainly can't govern the
Philippines. Beture the war the
natives held 99 per cent of the
island, Spain I per cent; now they
still hold 99 per cent and U. S I
per cent. And therefore our oc-
cupation is illegal.

Miss Macy very sitilitully recit~
ed one of the "\Nilliomville Sto-
ries," which was enjoyed by all
present, after which the decision
ot the judges was announced in
favor of the negative and the so

ciety adjourned.
