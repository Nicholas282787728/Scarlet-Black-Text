The works orrhe man who cre
ated the famed ziritle m the- middle
oicampus are now on display in the
Print Room downstairs in Biiriing.

The late Louis zirtlc has creat.
ed many other useless arriiacts that
are handy tor peeing on. In his most
ingenious sculpture, Louis added a
bowl to increase it's usefulness.

Louis’ display are part of the
sesquicentennial celebration this
year.

representative ofLouis'sstyle. Lime—
stone, steel, and walnut were used
for the sculptures,

MerchoulsdescribesLouls'style
as highly iormalistic, "He was Very
concerned about shape. surface, and
texture." As a result, inosr or the
sculptures are very smooth and well«
finished.

Louis also made complex wood—
workings with intricate parts that
appear able to move. He glued the
pairs so they would not move be—
cause he didn‘t want people to play
Withthem, The woodworkings grew
out of a fascination Louis had for
mechanical things. “He was espe.

ciallyiascinated with
lag tools, said Merle.

Although the Zirkle inthe mld<
dle of campus was never named, the
Louises nicknamed it "Old Rusty."
Few of Louis' sculptures are named.
The sculptures are meant to be very
visual, Merle said “He didn’t want
people to talk about his work, just
look at it."

Students should take a closer
look at the Zirkle, it is not quite as
monolithic as it appears, none ofthe
angles on the sculpture are the same.

A silversmith till 1977, his hol—
lowware was i luded in many na—
[ion—wide exh' tions and contests.
He created the school’s chalice for
specialcomrnunionservices,andihe
president’s medallion; which is worn
by the Grinnell College President at
ceremonial occasions. Merle con—
tributesLouis’shifttosculptingpara
ly [n a need to change. and also
because be it as teaching a sculptins
class at Otinnell and vianted to gain
more experience

Merle and Louis were the rust
laculiy members in the nation to be
hired underasharedcontract in 1961
at Grinnell They splitteaching du.
ties so each would have time to pure
sue their careers as artists. Louis
taught sculpture. ceramics, iewelry.
and design.

According to Merle, Louis en.
ioyed Henry Moore’s sculptures and
David smiths steel pieces: but she
could not identify their inﬂuence on
Louls' woric

A tireless worker, Louis rose at
seven every morning to work on his
art till the minute before class start—
ed. During the summer he was in his
studio from seven inthe morning till
{we at night. He usually produced a
a work every two months,

some of his pieces are held in
private collections and by orinneli
College.

Louis recieved a Bs. degree in
1957 at spurhern lilinois University
and an M.F.A. in 1959,

and Loew and Brown lived in Aus—
tria for a period of time,

Loew says the maiority of the
dances they know are from the Bal-
kans, the U.S., Western Europe,
Greece. and the Middle East (in»
(hiding Turkey and israel, among
other countries). In many of these
regions, a fair number ofthe dances
performed by folk dance groups are
no longer even practiced by the
peoples whose traditions originated
them. “A lot of the dances that we
probably currently do are no longer
done, because the villageshave been
destroyed. or the people have been
taken out ofwhete they lived," This
is especially true of the dances from
the Balkans. Loew believes.

Conveniently,GtinnellCollege
has hundreds of folk<dance music
records that were collected by the
folk dance group that the college
had in the 1960‘s and 1970's. This is
quite fortunate, Loewsays, because a
lot of folk music is no longer avail-
ableforsale. Loewsaysthattheclub
then had quite a large following,
with around 70 members. Several
Grinnell alumni that were members
of that club have encouraged Loew
and Brown to start folk dancing up
again at Grinnell. (Barbara Stone,
Grinnell Spanish lecturer, tried to a
couple of years ago, but at that time

Arts & Entertainm ent

there was not enough student inter—
est to keep the club going) )The old
group‘s records are cataloged by the
dances each record has music for, so
that ifa student knows a dance and
would like to teach it to the group,
the club can easily check ifthe col/
lege has the music for it. Loew says
she would be quite interested ifsome»
one would use the collection to teach
a dance to the club, as there are
plenty ofrecords not being utilized at
the moment because she and Brown
do not know the dances for them.
“We‘re really open to expanding our
knowledge, irthere were people who
wanted to come and teach some from
other Counlnesi"

Each meeting consists of learn—
ingseveralnewdancesandravlewmg
thosetaught inpreViousweeks. Loew
says that prospective participants
should not be intimidatedaboutjoin—
ing at any time, because the dances
are generally simple enough that it is
not hard to pick them up even if the
rest of the club already has learned
them. The club teaches line and
Circle danceswithafewpartner dance
es. and participants don‘t need to
bring a partner. Loew hopes to even—
tually find a different time to meet, as
Sunday evenings are busy for a lot of
students, but that Will remain the
meeting time until further notice.

Wind
Quintet
rescheduled

KATE LYoNs
ARTS EDITOR

Although the Winter‘s first snow
storm prevented the Arcadia Wind
QuintetfromperformlngonNovem»
bet 10, Grinnellians still have an
opportunity to see them perform at
Herrick Chapel. The concert is re«
scheduled for Monday, Dec. 4 at 8
pm.

The members of the quintet are
primarily from Des Moines; Terri
Cushman Knight is the only member
fromGrinnell— hence the impact of
weather conditions on the likelihood
of the performance, which won’t hap-
pen if the members are unable to
travel from Des Moines to Grinnell.

The program includes “a nice
variety of selections” according to
Terri cushman Knight. Planned for
the presentation are. among other
pieces, "Hornpipe from water Mu.
sic"byHandel,“Serenade"byFarkas,
“Eight Russian songs,” opus 58 by
A, Liadov, “Country Dance“ by Bee—
toven anda Mozartpiano quintet, for
which they will be joined by Janice
Wenst (an organ player for a church
in Des Moines). The concert will be
approximately one hour long,

The Arcadia Wind Quintet, a
traditional woodwind quintet orr
ganized in 1984, is a member of the
National Chamber Music America
Society, participates in the “Music in
the Schools" program, and promotes
music throughout Des Moines. They
usually perform two recitals a year
and work for private functions that
include church services, wedding
banquets, and receptions ofall sorts.

Terri Cushman Knight (oboe)
has been 2| member ofthe group since
1994. She became involved when
the music union that she is a member
of gave her name to the group, who
was in need of an oboe player.

Other members are Tamara
Foreman (flute), Harvey von Wald
(clarinet), Marie Eikenbetry (bas—
soon) and Donald Lomen, a regular
substitute for the usual horn player.
Aside from their musical careers,
many of the members have other Jobs
that range from a full time business
career to a mother of five. Marie
Eikenberry is the only original mem—
ber of the group.

So, instead of spending Monday
night as usual, maybe at Jlmbo's, the
forum playing pool, or chained to a
desk at the library, come to Herrick
chapel and relax with the Arcadia
Wind quintet.
