LIGHT ON THE SUBJECT

The appearance of Harlan Tarbell on the
college lecture course was difficult for some
to reconcile to what they believed to be the
“cultural” objectives of the course, but all
who attended the plogram found it a source
of unusual enjoyment. Fortunately, Mr.
Tarbel brollght with him his own stage
lighting equipment.

Miss Ria Ginster, the soprano, and Mr.
Rudolph Ganz, the pianist, for example, did
not furnish their own stage lighting ap-
paratus when they appeared to entertain
us. Nor should they have been expected to
do so. They suffered, as have the other coils
cer and lecture artists who have come to
Grinllell during many years, by being forced
to will audience attention ill competition
against the jumble of choir furniture and
white walls which formed their background
on the chapel platform.

Many hundred of dollars of student mon-
ey are spent each year to bring to our cani—
pus talented persons only to have their ef‘
fectiveness handicapped by a stage setting
that is, for the purpose, as artistically a11-
pointed as the inside of a ten year old
garage.

It takes little imagination to visualize the
heightened sense of drama which would
have been contributed to the performance of
the Eva Jessye Choir had all appropriate
backdrop been provided. Proper stage light-
ing alone would have permitted the dime
ming of the house lights and given the

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

artists the dramatic emphasis and focus of
light and attclltion which they deserved.

In another way, Grinnell will prove that
it is not slipping if next year’s concert and
lecture artists are given the benefit of ap-
propriate, effective staging. The students
and others who attend the programs will
have a keeller appreciation of the perfol'nr
ances because the artists will be presented
professionally, as tlmé should be.

PROTECTING BRITISH CHESTNUTS?

Coupled with President Itooscvelt’s message
to the dictators last week was a totally une
expected order for our battle wagons to re—
turn to the Paciiic.

Previously, the fleet had been expected to
remain in the Atlantic after the Carribean
maneuvers to stage a huge review for Sec-
retary of the Navy Swanson and another
for the President and the New York
World’s Fall. However, the big Show was
called off, and the gun-boats were sent
scuttling back to roost in the Mikado’s back
yard. Absolutely no explanation of the action
was given other than Roosevelt’s smiling,
“Well. the navy must always be subject to
orders, you kno\ ."

Because of the unexpectedness of the
action and the unusual veil of mystery,
Senators Borah alld Johnson immediately,
saw in the move evidence of a long-susq
pccted alliance between Great Britain alld
the United States by which the former was
to camp on the dictators’ doorstep and the
latter was to play governess to the Japan-
ese. (A year ago a Senate resolution des
lnanded of Secretary of State Hull if such
an understanding, expressed or unexpress»
ed, existed, and he cllrtly denied the
charge. However, Roosevelt issued no such
denial, and, at the time, some quarters ac-
cused him of failing to take Hull into his
confidence.)

That a secret formal alliance dividing the
world between the United States and Great
Britain exists is extremely doubtful. but it
is a well-known fact that the British have
approached the State Department upon the
subject se\ ral times. And, judging froln
this extraordinary naval order, it looks like
they have had something of success ill their
undercover effort to turn the State De-
partment into a branch office of No. 10
Downing Street.

Once again it appears that Uncle Sam
has let himself be duped illto pulling John
Bull’s chestnuts out of the fireiwe defend
their possessions in the East while they
protect ours ill the West. But this isn't the
first time; we’ve done that before. We did
it at the turn of the century in the Open
Door Policy when we guaranteed the status
quo of trading rights in China to discourage
German and Russian encroachments on
Britain’s trade l‘l‘lOlIOpOlyiﬂll under the
moral cloak of equality for all llations, of
course. We did it in 1914 in the guise of
“saving the world for democracy.” And
now it looks as if were going to do it again
ito “save the world from Facism," we sup—
pose.

‘Few Desires
For Peace A re
1 Worthy’ -Snyder

The Reverend Charles E. Snyder,
pastor of the Davenport Unitari;
on church, spoke before the peace
convocation Thursday on the sub
ject, “Is Your Desirc for Peace
Worthy?”

Rev. Snyder expressed the opin-
ion that most of the desires for
peace are not worthy and are mes
tivated through fear and partir
sanship rather than high moral
ideals.

The next war will cause eco»
iiomic and spiritual exhaustion
more far reaching than the last
war, according to Snydcti

America should enforce econom~
ic sanctions against all aggressor
nations most drastically, but
should in no case become involved
in a war. ”The place of the
United states,” Snyder comment-
ed. “is to resuscitate the ex-
hausted nations after the cons
