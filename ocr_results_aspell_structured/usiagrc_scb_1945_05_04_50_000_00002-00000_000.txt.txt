The Final Chapter - -

With the report of Hitler’s death coming
shortly after that of the folTner Italian
leader, Mussolini, on top of crumbling re
sistance on all fronts, the European War
is suddenly rushing to a final and dramatic
ending.

A fantastic story of murders, atrocities
and suicides from within Germany is being
reported daily. An even more amazing ac-
count of collapsing German resistanceis
being related to a world thirsty for such
news. Munich, Berlin, Hamburg and
Prague have failed in the wake of the on-
rushing Allied armies
.Italy nearly one million Germans have ca—
pitulated to the Allies with terms of un-
conditional surrender. Brenner Pass has
fallen and Hitler’s great mountain retreat
in Berchtesgaden is a mass of ruins. More
of the almost unbelievable horrors of the
German concentration camps are being re-
vealed constantly. Now we are actually
seeing unrolled before our very eyes the
story of the most barbaric nation in the
history of the world.

Coming fast upon the appointment of
Grand Admiral Karl Doenitz as the new
Rlehrel‘ of Germany, have been repeated

rumors of German surrender. Newspaper
editors and radio announcers have been
busy for days confirming and denying the
numerous and conflicting reports that are
coming in to them from all over the globe.
The entire world is anxiously awaiting the.
official allllouncement of V-E day. At this
point, no one knows what to expect next.
A German people no longer under the lead»
ership of the dynamic Hitler may not re-
spond to the commands of their new leaders,
Scattered German resistance may continue
for months. Again they could conceivably
collapse before this article goes to‘press.

Probably the new government will at
tempt -to gain the best possible peace terms
from the Allied commanders, and if they
find these attempts unsuccessful, they will
probably capitulatc at the earliest possible
moment.

How the people will react externally
uhen final Victory comes can only be
guessed at. But it is certain that under
neath, the feelings of all the Allied nations
uill be the same, At this instant, all of the
great Allied powers of the world are work-
ing in conjunction with the smaller coun-
tries in a common effort to maintain and
organize a lasting peace.

Whether we will succeed or not is a mat-
ter of future record. But, if we do not,
the complete annihilation of our world cive
ilization will stand to any unfortunate
souls remaining as an inglorious monument
to the failure of the nations of the world
to rise above their petty bickerings and
personal interests The death of the un»
counted millions in this war will not have
served in a successful enterprise unless we
succeed, once and for all, in the establish,
ment of some kind of world order which
will be a lasting assurance of :1 worth-
while sacrifice. We will awajt as anxiously
for the outcome of the San Francisco Con-
ference as we watched and are still watch-
ing for the news from all battle fronts.

When complete victory in Europe is fir
nally proclaimed, we must again re-affirm
our faith not only in those victorious arms
ies, but also in those that are still fighting,
by urging on in every possible way the
construction and completion of a success-
ful peace.
