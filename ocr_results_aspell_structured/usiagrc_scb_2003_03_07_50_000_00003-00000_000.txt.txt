merit vs. need—based aid

sponsored by Michael Andersen

Though merit aid is an important factor in
attracting top students, it's targeted not only
at smart people but at nch people: like many
colleges, Gnnnell has long padded the
admission packages of wealthy students with
small ”merit" grants in an efrort to bring them
to Gnnnell. Spare cash in the Financial Aid
budget shouldn't be used to further pad those
packages, but to allocate money to people who
need it most: 56A executives should stop
lobbying administrators to increase spending
on merit aid.

maintain need-blind aid

sponsored by Megan Hagenauor

rhererore, we the student body of Grinnell propose
that Gnnrletl should maintain its need-blind
admission policy for all applicants, including
international students.

make aid a priority

sponsored by Megan Hagenauer

We the student body of orinnell propose that
Grinnell make meeting the Fullsdemanstrated need
of all students, intludlng International students, a
higher budgetary priority, and understand that
this means that other budget items (such as new
buildings, concerts and speakers, college health
services, etc.) may have a decrease in funding.

In making this pledge, i voice my opposition to
proposals being discussed by some members of
the student government which would attempt
to codify and ”enforce" adherence to the
printiples of selteguvernance.

bonaparte: paragon of
self-governance

sponsored by Brooks Brunner

Grinnell College,

Noting with satisfaction that Napoleon
Bonaparte opposed the tyranny of French
Monarchy, and with the blessing of the French
People and of Pope Pius vu, stoically accepted the
terrible responsibility of leadership,

Recognizing the great man's achievements in
the fields of legal and administrative reform, his
curtailing of church excess, and his commitment to
republican ideals, as witnessed by the 'Code
Napoléon,’

bearing proud witness to the fact that he
allowed neither special interest groups, nor the
wealthy elites to influence unjustly his decisions.
Dismayed by his unfair treatment at the hands of
foreign dictators, who, in callous disregard of
Grinnell College's policy of self governance, exiled
him to Elba and later to St. Helena, and

Seeking to rectify our past lack of solidarity and
support for both Napoleon and his ideals,

1. Vows to hold the Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte
in highest esteem,

z. seeks to recognize both his naming day and his
coronation as holidays, to be celebrated with the
consumption of detectable ices,

3. Chooses to honor him by christening the
largest and most regal of the East Campus
dormitories ’le Dorm Napoléon.’

and of those votes, two-thirds need
to be in favor.

napoleone buonopan‘e:
scourge of europe

sponsored by Mallhew Smith

Grinnell tollege,

Recognizing that the usurper Buonaparte rudely
and unjustly seized power from its nghtful
executors, and in deﬁance of natural law and
indeed all that is holy, dehled the cathedral of
Notre Dame by there crowning himself Emperor,
Noting with dismay that buonaparte, by
implementing the ’Code Napoléon,’ and tampering
with ﬁnancial, religious and educational
institutions, sought to remake Greater Europe to
his own specifications, in direct contravention to
Grinnell College’s avowed policy of self
governance,

Emphasizing that Buunaparte used treachery
vile cunning and brute rorce to maintain his foul
regime, such as the brutal suppression of royalist
movements, and the murder oi the Duc d’Enghien,
calling attention to the fact that exile on Elba
and St. Helena can never be punishment enough
for the Butcher of Austerlitz, and,

Seeking to rectify our abominable failure to
cake a stand on this issue,

1. Vows to regard the little Corporal with derision
and contempt,

z. Refuses to recognize the mercenary
rrenchiﬁcation of his name,

What if I’ve never
used Blackboard

before?

This is where it gets a little
more tricky. Your Blackboard
password isn’t the same as
your regular Wehmail/NT
storage password. If you’re
not a ﬁrst year or a transfer
student, until you change
it, your password for
Blackboard is automatically
set for the last seven digits
of your to number including
some of those leading
zeros. however, if you are a
first-year or a transfer
student, until you change
it, your password is the
number after you drop all
the leading zeros. All of
them.

I don’t get it.

The 8&8 talks with Environmental Coordinator Brian Turner ‘02 about recycling 'at Grinnell. . .

What material would you say is most often

improperly recycled at Grinnell?

Our biggest problem is with paper. Grinnell used to separate
out white paper, which generates more revenue. That
proved impossible for people to do, so we moved to
"mixed paper' which includes more than white. There is
still a tendency to throw magazines and newspapers in

the mixed paper bin. This neglect is called
contamination and the risk is that the whole bag
might be thrown out.

to empty the glass recycling containers, this eases the
burden on the facilities crew,

one glass container to the recycling facility in town must
not exceed the amount it would cost to throw it out. That
takes extraordinary efﬁciency. Assuming an empty glass
bottle weighs 1/4 pounds it costs a half a cent to throw it
in the trash. FM would have to take 3000 glass bottles in
an hour to make back the labor they expended. if some
entrepreneurial students decided to make their room glass
havens, they could take the bottles to McNally's get 3150.

Is this more an effort to reduce solid waste, or
an effort to save energy?

Both are important components to recycling. We pay 540
for each ton of trash taken to the landﬁll. The more we can
divert materials from this waste stream the less we pay and
less we let sit in those monsterous landﬁll piles Americans
are famous for. Disposable packaging, much to the
dissatisfaction of environmentalists, take far less energy to
produce than Nalgene bottles or ceramic cups. Those
products do, however, take up space somewhere, The first
priorities with recycling economically and you heard it
probably in first grade, is to reduce or reuse.

Is there any chance of recycling services' being
rolled back if they're misused?

Because of landfill overflow it is actually mandated by Iowa
state law that cities reduce their waste stream. The city of
Grinnell has a residential diversion rate of about 40
percent, but because businesses have been sluggish and
private haulers aren’t required to recycle it dwindles to
about 25 percent. The recycling program has become
institutionalized at the college and will remain. If anything
it’s a matter of the college's image, though that‘s not the
best reason to recycle.

What does Grinnell successfully

recycle the most of?
The dining halls successfully recycle 100
percent of the packaging they receive and
have a plan to start composting organic food
waste once centralized dining arrives. Students
tend to do the best with the tan-cans because
the revenue irom them is directed back to
student activities. why they don’t do the same
with glass heaven knows, but I think there is a
big money-making potential there. Anyone is welcome

Does it take more energy to recycle, say, a
glass bottle than to produce a new one?

This question entirely depends on the efﬁciency of the
program and speaks to the need to separate correctly,

The common criticism of recycling programs is that they
don’t pay off. To save money, the labor expended on taking
