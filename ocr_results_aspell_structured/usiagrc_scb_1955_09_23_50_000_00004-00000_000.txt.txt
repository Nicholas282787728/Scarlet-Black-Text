|0.000 Mile Pilgrimage For Peace
Rouies Woman Through Grinnell

by Chuck Stegmeir

Peace Pilgrim Visited Grinnell Thursday

afternoon.

Clad in at blue sweztt shirt and trousers, she announced she

is visiting each state capital

on a 10,000 mile pilgrimage

for world disarmament. She is walking most of the way.
“There is an awful lot of interest in peace in Iowa,"

she said. “Many people have stopped to talk to me about it ”

Starts at Ammlﬂ,

Peace, as she asked to lie
tailed, is an older woman with
graying hair and sunhurned
cheeks. she started her lowa
pilgrimage at Arnana on Wed
nesday and hopes to reach Des
Moines by Saturday. while there
she will visit the capitol build
ing and expects to talk to Gov-

ernor Leo Heegh.

This is the 18th State she has
visited on her Current journey.
So far she has walked 6,580
miles.

Averaging 25 Miles

Averaging 25. miles a day,
Peace Pilgrim stayed Wednes-
day night in Victor and hoped
to reach Newton Thursday
night.

“It’s easy to walk 25 miles a
day and it gives me lots of time
to talk to people," she said. ”All
I own is what I have on my
back. i walk purely on faith."

Explaining that pilgrimages
were common in the middle
ages as individual acts of pens
ance and faith, she stated that
she has vowed, “Until mankind
has learned the way to peace,
I shall remain a wanderer on
the face of the earth—walking
until 1 am given shelter, fasting
until I am given food, using
money given me to bring the
message of the way to peace to
the people of my country and
or he world.”

Trips Have ,Effect

Peace Pilgrim has already
walked coast to coast and bord-
er to border. she feels her p
grimages are not without ef—
fect. “I handed president Eisene
hower a petition for a peace dee
partment and later he appointed
Harold Stassen his special as-
sistant on disarmament. ,

“The key word for our time
is practice," Peace said. “We
don’t practice what we already
know to he the way to peace.”

Shops at Davenport

Her first stop in Iowa was
Davenport. Later she visited
Cedar Rapids, the state Univer
sity oi lowa and Scattergood
school at West Branch. At this
time she was not on a pilgrime
age, she enclained, and accepted
rides when they were otter-ed
to her. .

The last state she crossed was
lllinois where she talked with
Governor William stratton in
Springﬁeld,
