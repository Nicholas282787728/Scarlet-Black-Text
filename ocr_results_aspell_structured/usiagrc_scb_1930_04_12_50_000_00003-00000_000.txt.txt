Cornell University _
Drops 164 Students

ITHACA, N. Y.~Cornell univer‘
sity.dropped 154 students at the end
of the first term because of deficié
encies in studies. Last year 123 stu<
dents received the penalty. The av-
erage for ten years, 1920-1929, was
224.

For the past several years there
has been a notable decrease in the
number of students dropped for this
cause, and the Cornell authorities as-
cribe the improved showing to the
effects of the selective system of ad.
mission which has been in force for
the past four years.

In the College of Arts and Sci
ences, where the selective system is
in' operation, fifty students were
dropped this year as compared with
an average of 7A for the eight years,
1920-1927. Twelve women are in—
cluded in the 164 students who were
dropped.

Danish Gymnastics
Popular at Grinnell

Grinnell co-eds have found in Dans
ish gymnastics a new way to make
their ﬁgures more graceful and their
movements more rhythmic. The
Danish exercises. introduced here
this year. have already proved one
of the most popular forms of physi-
cal education for women.

"Girls are continually telling me
that they are now able to do many
things requiring co-ordination and
ﬂexibility that they were unable to
do before they entered the class,"
said Miss Harriett Koglin, instructor
in physical education.tor women this
week. Miss Koglin regards Danish
gymnastics as one of the most benc-
ficial forms of corrective exercise
that can be taken,

The slow, rhythmic movements of
Danish gymnastics produce dexibili-
ty, co-ordination, and gracefulness.
The exercises can be taken without
relaxation periods between, since dit—‘
ferent parts of the body work at
different times.

l Campus Opinion i

Question: Would you be in favor
of having all balls at the dormitories
hold house meetings at a scheduled
time, say seven o'clock Monday eve—
hing?

Sheppard Taylor '33: Being a prop,
I'm not especially in favor of it.

Jonathan Dimforlzll '31: No. We
don‘t have anything to talk about.

Willis Gardner '33: I shouldn’t
think it necessary unless there were
some special business. Simply a
waste of time.

Forest Riuley '33: 1 would be in
favor of it. It helps good feeling
among the fellows to have meetings
oftener. I don't think weekly would

Bernard Tehbens 131: Yes. Every
group has some routine business
which needs regular attention.

James Tipton: No. Mostly those

Ed Liedtke '3 , No. There's too
many other things to do. It would
