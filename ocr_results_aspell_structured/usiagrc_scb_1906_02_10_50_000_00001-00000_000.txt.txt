The Simpson Basker Hall Team is Easily
Deieated by the Scarlet and Black
Players.

The local basketball team made al
dying trip to indianola last WetllieSc
day and invaded the Methodist lines,
escaping only after ascore or 73 had
been secured as opposed to on the
side of the Simpsouites. The game
was called atti, Oo'cluuk in order to
allow the viSitini: team to make re

part of the play showed the teams ape
patently evenly matched and in er
change of baskets neither team was
able to secure any Wide margin in
score. The typography of the court
proved somewhat or a puzzle to the
Scarlet and Black and only until cert
Lain dilficulties became Solved was
the Griuilell team able to widen the
breech to the tune 0127 to 14 [or the
ﬁrst half.

The second half Showed the ViSlLOI‘s
up in more nearly their true iorm.
and the‘Topid ﬁre“ began. Baskets
were scored at will on all the straight
plays. Every man took a hand in
contributing points, and not until a
total of 73 was reached did the whistle
[or "time" put an end to the evening’s
entertainment.

DR. WASHINGTON GLADDEN.
Pruiessurjess: Macy Pays Tribute to the
Noied Congregational Leader at the
Friday Morning Service,

On February 11. the venerable lead-
erol Congregationalism, Dr. Washing
ton Gladden, or Columbus, Ohio, will
have reached the allotted age or man,
threescore years and ten, and apropos
to the occasion l’i‘olessor Jesse Macy.
an intimate friend and admirer, spoke
brieﬂy concerning the strenuous on
rear of that famous divine, at the
chapel service Friday morning. Dr.
Gladdeii’s hymn, “0 Master, let me
Walk with Thee,” one of his own come
posi ions, was sung.

Pi'olessor Macy prefaced his remarks
by stating that Dr. Gladden had noth-
ing to do with the celebration of his
seventieth birthday; it was the work
of his friends, He said also, that he
did not believe the latter would care
to have his label‘s recounted as it
would not be in harmony with the
man. Dr. Gladden has always been
able to speak for himseli and in no un-
certain tone, either.
