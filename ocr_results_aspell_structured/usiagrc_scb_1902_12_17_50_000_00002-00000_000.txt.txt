hand and every one can enioy
fully the luxuries which money
can buy. And at the end of such
ayear the Christmastide is Coming
and is sure to be happy and tull
of good cheer for one and all.
While men are remembering their
friends and the poor with Christ
mas gifts, why not make a gift to
Iowa College? Where can a man
make a better investment? Where
can he make one that n-ill bring
better or greater results" No-
where can a man build for himself
a better monument than a prosper

iris gift keep growing and spreads
ing year alter year. Make an in-
vestment here; it will pay.

which is unsatisfactory is that not
all the contestants can win. Some
one must be disappointed. th
very often the truest grit is shown
by the loser. All men must lose

nran's enterprises tail, and olten
the best man is the one who is able
to lose gainely. It's the average

a year, not a list of success 5 or
failures, but the total results.

a holiday till he hus done harcl
work, for it in the change, the
relaxation and rest, and the satis-
lnction with one’s work that much
of the pleasure of the vacation
consists.
