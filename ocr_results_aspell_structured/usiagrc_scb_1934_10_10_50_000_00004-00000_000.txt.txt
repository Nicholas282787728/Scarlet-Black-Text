defensive linemen, letting them sill
through to down ball carriers in their
tracks.

ght workouts this week have so
far failed to show any improvement in
these fundamentals, hut before the
week is over, it is expceted that drills
by Coaches L L (Fuzz) Watt and Les

aggressiveness of which the Pioneers
arc capable,

Floyd Hui-ton, reserve guard, has
bccn shined to Phelps‘ position at end
and has shown prospects of rounding
into a fast, wary winginan.

the Aggies forget about the conference
and concentrate on beating Haskell
