By JON ROSE
SCtA Concerts Chair

TONIGHT is the final concert
of the semester and it prom-
ises to be one of the most
clectrit‘yingpen‘ormancesol'theyw,
Lil'Ed Williams,along withhisBlues
Imperials, will be gracing the Harris
Ccnlerwith theirhigh-poweredblues.
Lil’ Ed and the Blues Imperials are
considered by many critics to be the
world’s number-one house-rocking

blues band.

The band, who hails from Chi-
cago, played their ﬁrst show in 1975
and spent many years playing in ev-
ery West Side bar in the city. During
the beginning, Ed relied on his job at
the Red Carpet Car Wash to pay the
rent, but continued to play the blues.
By the mid 1980s, Lil’ Ed and the
Blues Imperials caught the attention
of Chicago’s Alligator records and
released their first album in 1986.
From thatmoment. the band became

“Two Chambered Art”

WO srudents' works are pres
I ently on display in the Forum
Terrace Art Gallery. "Two
chambered Art" is the product of
sophomores Thessaly Sutton and
Eugenia Vergara, and is on display
until Friday, November 18. The
works are primarily from this
semester's drawing class with It
Carlos Ferguson, landscapes created
with different media like pastels and
ink, as well as ﬁgures.

Though exhibitor Thessaly
Sutton commented that she thought
the work speaks for itself, she did
say, “I like having an exhibit with
another person. especially Eugenia.
because I think our pieces compler
ment each other well. Our subjects
are generally the same -- landscapes
and figurcswand sol think it‘s inter-
esting to compare our different ap-
proaches to handling the materials.
In addluon. our art is mixed together
instead of segregated, and this inte
gration enhances our work."

Eugenia Vergara said, “I think
the strongest pan of the work are the
landscapes. It is a wonderful oppor-
tunity to work with space andexpress
the sense of freedom in the page. I
come from one of the largest cities in
the world, Mexico City. and coming
herehaschangedmyworkvery much.
Going outside and seeing all those
wonderful colors and spaces is some-
thing that I needed“

"Aboutﬁgure drawing,1think it
is a challenge for any artist tocontrol
the value and line of the drawing to
represent something that is alive. I
feel that I have a lot to lean'l and
express in the page, and those ﬁgure
studies are a sample of the freedom
that I acquired working with ink.“

Everyone is encouraged to go
see this exhihiL “It’sdiiTlcult for me
to talk about the work; people should
go see the show themselves,” said
Sutton. Vergaraadded.“lreally hope
other people can enjoy Thessaly’s
work and mine as much as we did
when we made lit lalso want to thank
the people who had helped me and
teach me how to ‘scc’ our surroundr
ings."

La Struda
Thursday, November 17. 9:15 pm.

La Strada is the story of
Gelsomina, a lovable, simple-minded
wail who is sent to perform on the
road with Zampano, a strong man
who teaches her to beat the dmm and
playthe trumpet forhis act. ltbrought
international recognition to director
Federico Fellini

Made six years at‘IerTheBicycIe
Thief, La Strada reveals changes
made in the approach to Italian Neo-
Realism in the interim, The style has
softened to the point that Fellini is
able to apply a poetic form to his
material. In theorlginal Realisttmdi-
tion, La Strada is concerned with

awareness. Gelsomina moves froma

too late. Stylistjcally,Fellini‘spoetic
touch is evident in the photography,
the winter landscapes, the circus
music. in Gelsomia’s haunting trum-
pet tune and in the riderless horse
scene.

The most memorable aspect of
La Strada is Giulietta Masina’s per-
formanceas Gelsomina. Fellini casts
his wife in many ofhis ﬁlms. but this
is her best role. She makes the film a
memorable experience

La Strada won the Grand Prize
at the Vienna Film Festival, the New
York Critics Award and the Acad-
emy Award for Best Foreign Film.

The subtitles for some of the dia—

Alas, Ialso missed this at my
local theater. According to the
promotional ﬂycrs and David
Sheehan of NBC (I couldn’t find
anyone else who‘s seen it). “Alec
Baldwin and Kim Basinger bring
Bonnie and Clyde into the 905
with surprise, suspense and sexual
intensity." Such thingsas danger-
ous deals. double crosses and set-
ups are also mentioned. Hmmm.
Sounds like an real action»packed
