The choir returned to the U.
S. this fall after a European tour,
during which a festival in Vienna
celebrated the 450th anniversary
of the establishment of the group
by Maximilian 1, His imperial dc-
cree of July 7, 1498 directed thatI
a choir be organized to sing dailyl
masses in the court chapel. i

Attiter the death of Maxunilian,i
succeeding Hapsburgs continued

. to subsidize the choir, and it
achieved fame throughout Europe.
Josef Haydn and Franz Sohubcrt,
as children, were members of the
chorus until their voices chang-

concerts were not then in vogue.
a stipulation in the “instructions
to the Kapellmeister” provided
that the boys could perform in

persons.”

A century later, lgiiaz Umlauf,
the choir-master, received ,pere
mission to have the choir appear
in chorus parts of operas and
other musical functions.

Today, ministered by the finestl
teachers in Vienna, this organi~

Calling the repudiation of Wain

demonstration to the peoples of
Europe that Americans hack the
Marshall Plan, Dr. Friedrich
briefly hammered the Progres~
sive party candidate’s cbstnic-
tionist tactics during the spring
of 1947, 'h'tllnlaly blaming him
for the failure of the Moscow
conference that year.

”The Marshall Plan is a prome
ising effort to prevent the rise
of Fascism in Western Europe,
not the rise of Communism," said
the lecturer, explaining that the
danger of the Communist strug-
gle over the French coal mines,
for instance. lay in the emergence
of a French Fascist bloc which
would materially heighten the
prospect of a third world war.

Reviewing the growbh of the
plan from the germinal idea in

Friedrich told of the politically

Washinglon Dean Says
No Preceden’r Made

Dean Edward K, Graham of
Washington university stated
Thursday morning. “We will send
our freshmen players to the Grine
nell contest, but they will see no
action."

Dean Graham added that “this
action was taken in the interests
of cordial relations with Grinnell
and in no way was to be considr
ered as establishing a precedent.”

At a meeting of the Quarter--
back club last week, Coach
“Bunny” Oakes came to the fore-
front in protesting the use of
freshmen players by the Wash-
ington university eleven, which
Gi-innell plays tomorrow after-
noon on Ward field.

“The main concern," said the
Grinnell Herald-Register, “is not
so much against legitimate freshr
men but against former service
men who had been members of
service teams under good coach
ing and entered the university
with freshman ranking."

Russian Blockade, Mistakes

,Defeat Germa

n Communists

The second lecture by Dr. Friedrich, “Bcriin, Time Bomb or

Cornerstone: The Crisis of the Un
ing, was designed to answer the q

itcd Nations,” given Monday evene
uestion, “Why are we in Berlin?"

Berlin, he said, is necessary as the location of a common gov-

erning place,

Furthermore, under the Potsdam Agreement, Berlin

is a separate zone. not in the Sovret zone at all; hence RuSSla had

no

Dr. Friedrich listed the primary
reasons for the ruin of Russian
chances to take Germany: l. c.,
aggressively annexing territory
and expelling citizens from the
German provinces given to Po~
land, the conduct of the Red
army in Eastern Germany, hand-
ling of German prisoners of war,
the repaintions policy, and the
Berlin blockade.

The blockade, and the resulting
airlift, gave the western nations
an opportunity to raise their
slowly ebbing prestige, and to
prove to Europe, and, more im—
portaiit, to the Germans, that the
United States is serious in its
intent to resist the Russians. The
result has been that the Corn»
munists have steadily lost ground
in all of Germany, most pariticu»
lai-ly Berlin.

Ono Communist leader remark-
ed that three weeks of the airlift

had destroyed three yiairs of care-
,ful Communist spade worlc

Dr. Friedrich said, “The block»
adc remains because we have at.
tempted to negotiate with the
Russians, thereby making the
Soviet Union think that we are
in a weak position," He also
maintained that the submission of
the “Berlin crisis” to the United
Nations was not the right thing
to do. as the'UN is essentially
a four power organization, and
the problem originated among
these same four powers.

Final evidence that the 'Rus»
sians have lost the. battle for Ger-
many as a result of meir loss
of the battle of Berlin is found
in their refusal to permit free
elections within Germany. They
had discovered that only 10 to
20 percent of the German people
would vote for the Communists.

Two Forms of Democracy Complical‘e
Si+ua+ion of U. S. and Russia in Berlin

“Two conceptions of (ll-mac»
rncy have led to the break
doun betwcen Russia and the
United States nvcr berliii,"
stated Dr. Carl Friedrich in his
talk, “Developing Constitution
iil Government in Germany,"
Wednesday night in ARH illllll~
torium.

”We of the United States are
not the only people claiming to
be a democracy," Friedrich told
the student and facility audience.

“Russia also claims to be 3. de-I
ing our democracy on the Ger-

mans, we are teaching them

 

something entirely different from

that taught by the USSR."
Dr. Friedrich criticized the
policy of unconditional sun-en»
dcr that was forced upon Ger-
many at the end of the war as
being largely to blame for the
current misundcrstnnding.

“Had we drawn up plans on
how Germany was to be treated
before we took over the country,
we might have settled before-
hand many of these complicated
issues we now face,“ he said.
“Now we have the two powers
of the world competing to see
whose form of constitutional gov-
ernment will succeed.”
