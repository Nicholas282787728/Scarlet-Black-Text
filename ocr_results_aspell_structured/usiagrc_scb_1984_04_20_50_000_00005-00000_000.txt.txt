Norris
fire pranks

To the Editor:

As one of the Norris residents
who has gotten up for all three of
the recent fire alarms. I have
started to notice an interesting
pattern.

For the iirst alarm approx
imately so people leit the dorm as
they would have done during a
normal drill, For the second
alarm. no one went outside, while
only a iew came out of their
rooms, During the most recent
alarm. only iour people, out oi a
floor of 25 people. even got out of
bed.

It the false alarms were to con-
tinue to occur. I would venture to
guess that not only would Nora
risites stop responding to the
alarms altogether, but they might
even stop waking up for them.
Like those people who get ac~
customed to sleeping in homes
situated near railroad tracks.
Norris residents are fast becom-
ing conditioned to sleeping
through fire alarms.

While the probability of a fire
occurring at Norris Hall wiuiin
the next six weeks is highly
unlikely. it seems appropriate, at
this point, to remind those respon-
sible for the false alarms of the
consequences it such a possibility
were to become reality

In the event of a real disaster,
the orderly evacuation that an
early warning system is intended
to achieve would fall apart in con-
fusion and panic. While it is again
unlikely that anyone would be leit
behind in their rooms. the delay
caused by such panic and confu-
sion could result in serious injury.
if not death.

Although The Boy Who Cried
Wall is usually recounted to
school-aged children as a lesson
on the dangers of false alarms. it
would seem that there are some
people at Grinnell who could
beneiit irom a rereading oi this
fable. — Arlene Sloan

To the Editor:

Upon hearing that Younker Hall
had planned to hold a toga party
tonight. i initially had a greatieel-
ing of disgust. and then embar-
rassment for the organizers of the
party and tor Grinnell College in
general,

Today is Good Friday to those of

the Christian faith and the Jewish
are observing Passover.

patrons are to wear clothing
esemblmg that oi the Romans,
nd considering that the party is
n no way a celebration oi this
eiigious holiday. it seems that the
ilanners see some sort of humor
n this.

Let it be known that I am not an
ntrovert. inherently opposed to
aving good times. I am.
owever. a Student with a consV
ience. I am not opposed to
tnyone holding a party at any
me, but in my opinion and in
hose at many of my colleagues.
he Younker's use oi togas is in
car taste.

If the organizers did not intend
0 make some sort oi pun, l
pologize; but also I question the
ntelligence oi an entire dorm that
oesn't realize what they had

Before I am labeled a “Holy
‘oller” or 3 “Jesus Freak”.
lease listen to my point. For per-
ons of the Christian or Jewish
ersuasion. Good Friday and the

'assover are days of vital impor», . .

tance to their faith.

Regardless of whether the ma»
jority oi the campus have ieeiings
one way or the other. it seems that
at a school filled with the open-
minded. people would respect
bthcr's religious holidays Thus.
irrelevant of whether one tinds
any signiiicange in the Passover
or Good Friday, it seems that
good taste and civility should
prevail.

i call on people at any or no
religious faith to boycott the
Younker party as a Signal to the
organizers we ieel that people or
any faith have a right to observe
their holy days without the
presence of demeaning activities.

Blasts
‘Golden’

column

T0 the Editor:

I am a bit concerned. Last week
I read a short article concerning
our President-elect. Matt Golden
The article, called “The Golden
Security Force," was. to say the
least. highly inflammatory.

i was not under the assumption
that the newspaper was a partisan
publication, but, having read this.
I new question that possibility.
But that is not my point.

what is my point? It is that the
newspaper, going on nothing more
than the heresay oi one person.
without any veriiying procedure
and without haying consulted
Matt Golden. went ahead with the
printing oi an article that not only
castigated him with no chance of
immediate reply. but was patent
ly false!

[saw Mr Golden that night: he
was not drunk, In fact. I cannot
remember seeing Matt seriously
inebriated this semester.

The article also kept referring
to ”President" Golden. In fact.
the party was held long beiore the
election, Now. unless the office of
the SGA President has somehow
become mystically retroactive. so
that all past actions must forever
now be judged in the light oi that
office. referring to Matt Golden as
“President", is more likley
malicious historical quackery
that went unchecked by an either
politically amenable editor. or an
editor who was temporarily in»
capable or judgment. Clearly, all
oi the choices are concerning.

It is a commonly held opinion
that Rupert Murdoch is a twit.
Perhaps the staff at the 8&3 does
not always agree. A lot of your
stuff is good, Don't soil it with dir-
ty laundry, Please. 7 David

To the Editor:

We would like to express our
surprise at the composition oi the
”Peace Day” event which will be
held tomorrow

Though a plethora oi campus
activist groups have been invited
to participate, neither of the
United States' two major political
parties were solicited for par»
ticipation. it would appear that. at
least to the organizers of Peace
Day, environmentalists.
choristers and Andean musicians
may be concerned about world
peace. but Republicans and
Democrats may not.

It will undoubtedly be objected
that the omission was made from
a desire not to “politicize” the

event. But the entire event is come
posed mainly oi groups which

. .devote, at least some of their

Scarlet 8: Bing];

resources to political activity. in
whatever area. and seek to pre-
vent an at least partially political
product. i e. war. but some groups
are not allowed to participate
because they “politicize” that
event.

This to us betrays an inadequate
tndcrstanding of the cricial role
played by politics in the aim. oi
Peace Day Politics gives shape to
“Peace" ii only by embodying
and implementing nonrpolitical
desires. Peace Day should have
included those organizations
which are concerned with the
politics and politicians who will
create (or betray) peace,

Believe it or not. Republicans
and Democrats have plans ior ate
tainlng peace tor at least prevenr
ting war) and however distasteiui
these plans may be. do they not
deserve an equal chance at par-
ticipation’.’

This is not to criticize those
organizations which participate in
Peace Day. On the contrary, they
are to be lauded for their concern
and willingness to express that
concern, Peace is a noble goal.
and all who seek to achieve it are
equal in their participation in that
quest. it is a pity thatPeace Day's
organizers do not. apparently.

An Easter
message

To the Editor-

On a Friday. about 2000 years
ago, Jesus Christ was nailed to a
wooden cross and hung up to die,

0n the Sunday morning, three of
the women who were followers of
Jesus got up early to go to His
tomb and finish anointing the
body, When they arrived, they
iound the tomb open and the body
was gone. No other sound ex-
planation has been given for the
empty tomb, other than that
Christ did indeed rise from the
dead. just as He said He would.

I. and millions of others around
the world, believe and know that
He is alive today, i cannot
“prove" this to anyone 7 it is
something you must iind out ior
yourself.

Have you ever considered
Christ? I am not here talking
about “religion" or “the chiirch"
or any other institution i am Lalkr
ing about Jesus Christ 7 He lives!

Three years ago i asked Jesus
Christ to come to me, to “come "1'
to" my life. He did. and He has
changed me in many ways and
given true meaning to my life.
Yet the most important thing He
has given me is eternal life with
Him, which has begun here and
will continue. after my death. in
heaven

l’m not sure where heaven is.
but I know that I'll be with Christ
forever. and that makes me very
happy. 7 Tim Wareiiaiii

Who’s

18 1t?

To the Editor:

I have grown inured to finding
singleminded attacks on conser»
vative values in the pages oi the
Sim, but when one attacks a Clint
Eastwood movie as a violent
“right-wing fantasy." one has
gone too far.

No. The situation “Dirty
Harry" depicts is a rightrwing
nightmare what conservatives
[ear is a criminal justice system
overloaded with technicalities
that impede the arrest. convic-
tion, and incarceration of
criminals,

When policemen see their
suspecw ,exiting to .the stneet

through a revolving-door judicial
system — when the robbed, the
raped and the relatives oi the
murdered see their tormentors
committing the same crimes
again and again — in short. when
ordinary citizens see that justice
cannot be done through the
system, they will say with Dirty
Harry. “Then the law is crazy."
and they will take justice into
their own hands.

That is the nightmare “Dirty
Harry” depicts. is it the leit-wing
fantasy? — Nicole Etcllcson

Responding
to Lane’s

response

To the Editor.

Hugh Lane, in his letter to the
Editor. questions whether divesta
ment is the best course of action to
promote social change in South
Africa. Let us investigate Mr.
Lane's reasoning.

First, Mr Lane mentions the
Sullivan principles. which are
non-binding principles regarding
treatment of black workers.
These principles have made prac~
ticaiiy no impact on the oppresV
sion oi black people in South
Africa and have been admitted to
be all but useless by their author,
Reverend Sullivan, Mr. Lane
himseli admits tht putting the
responsibility on the corporation
is foolish and meaningful change
will only come irom pressure here
in the USA. Thus. it is clear the
Sullivan principles hold no real
solution.

Still, Mr. Lane gives a scenario
by which we tthe USA) divest and
this results in the infamous
“bloodbath”, Here I'm afraid Mr.
Lane is missing the point. We are
not going to cause any such
“bloodhath” by withdrawing tby
the way. the same argument was
used about Vietnaml. all we will
be doing IS refusing to support (as
we do nowi and thereby weaken a
brutal and racist regime

The example of Zimbabwe is a
valuable one, Once the western
powers stopped supporting. [inane
cially and politically. that
minority»ruled government
thhodesiat. it fell quickly and
meekiy. The reason ior this was
that the vast majority oi the peo-
ple were against the government,
as is exactly the case in South
Africa.

Leavmg all this speculation
aside. I suppose the real question
is what is an acceptable solution
in South Africa and how can we
get there? In my eyes. the only ac
ceptable situation is the basic
right to vote for all people, which
would mean a majority rule
government. Uniortunateiy. it is
is impossible to get there through
proxy resolutions.

This is true for two reasons.
First. proxy resolutions in major
corporations always lose, in the
iour years I've been iollowing this
issue I've never seen a resolution
get more than 5 percent of the
total vote. This is hardly enough to
pass, nor are the votes getting any
closer. Second, the corporations in
South Africa must abide by Apar-
theid law. which is institutionaliz-
ed racism.

Thus, the corporations have no
avenue for bringing about an ac
ceptable situtation in South
Africa, even If they wanted to, Our
stocks constitute power only ii we
abide by South African law. This
law will not allow an acceptable
situation in South Africa.

Divestment suggests many
good things. First, and very im-
portantly, we will have stopped
aiding moral injustice. We cannot

' control other people’s actions, we
lMinn only control our own. Thus

Mr. Lane’s argument that other
people will pick up our in
vestments is vacuous. We can on
ly do what we can do. other people
must account for their actions and
abide by their consciences.

Right at this very moment, we
are helping the South African
government oppress its majority
black African population We (the
USA) supply money for the South
African regime to use [or
whatever purpose it chooses:
computers which keep track oi
every black person through the
passbook system, motor vehicles
which are quickly turned into are
morcd cars cruising the streets oi
the black townships; and guns
tthnugli this is contrary to con-
gressional policy). shipped in
parts and assembled in South
Africa. which are used to gun
down black people.

Finally. proxy resolutions are
not the only way to bring about
peaceiui change in South Africa.
in fact. they cannot bring about
the most important change (ma-
jority rule) because the corpora-
tions are subject to the laws of
Apartheid. The economic and
political pressure of divesting.
and encouraging other nations to
follow. is the strongest. most
meaningful action we can take 7
here in the USA 7 to bringing
about an acceptable situation in
South Africa. — Rob Schwartz
