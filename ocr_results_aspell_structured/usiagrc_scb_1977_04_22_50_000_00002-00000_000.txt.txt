l-lorn uses a chemical called
“Dursban” to treat the areas in the
kitchen that are roach infested.
“The treatment lasts for 150 days,”
he said, “but that is under
laboratory conditions. Because we
are under an area of high heat
concentration the chemicals ma
break down and reduce the e-
fectiveness time , . .In a building
like this, there is really no way of
completely controlling the
situation.”

Hawn States that “only monthly
exterminating control"
of the entire campus would be
effective in the complete
elimination of pests. As the
situation stands now, the inability
oi the Physical Plant to get into
individual studens‘ rooms because
of privacy laws rules out the
possibility of an all out attack on
pests, maintains Hawn

The Quad dining and kitchen
facilities have some of the
problems similar to those ex»

erienced‘ in Cowles. The kitchen
iacilities in Quad are located on
two levels. The basement level
houses the campus bake shop, a
bank of walk-in freezers and a
storage area for foodstuffs. The
first floor holds the main kitchen,
dish machine, and serving line.

McConnell believes that “the
basement area of Quad is as bad as
Cowles as faras the walls and floor
are concerned." Yet it is generally
conceded that Quad has nowhere
near the pest or plumbing
problems that plague Cowles.

McConnell and Fossum are also
concerned about the condition of
the equipment in Quad and Cowles
Most of the food preparation
equipment is over fifteen years old,
Fossum stated that, “some of the
equipment here in Cowles wouldn't
be acceptable to 0.S.H.A, (cc,
cupational Saiety and Health Act,
the outgrowth of which is an in-
spection agency for any type of
food service operation}.

lunch ol the equipment in use at
Cowles is what Fossum calls “third
phase," that is, equipment that
should not be used because of its
age. There is little to do but sell it
for scrap metal. Dave 'McConnell
believes that SAGA, the previous
service using the Cowles and Quad
facilities. was “gmsslynegligent”
in maintaining the equipment.

"The most noticeable area or incomplete construction is the ceiling
that is located over the storage freezers in the northwest corner or the
kitchen area. Hanging irom the ceiling are electrical lighting and

Treasurer of the College Robert
Anderson, who has toured the
facilities both at Cowles and Quad,
stated that the problems “reflected
the age of the facilities."

President Turner explained,
“We are aware of the situation at
both places. ..yet there has not been
an accumulation of reserve capital
to deal with any major problems."
Turner will call for an informal
evaluation at the end of the year
to determine the costs of 1m,
proving the iacilities. "As of now,”
he continued, “the college is
budgeting as It happens,” An-
derson set a rough ﬁgure of $40,000
to $50,000 for cosmetic imr
provements to Cowles.

McConnell, who believes that
“there are some very serious
limitations in the buildings,” is
exploring alternatives beyond
renovating Cowles and Quad,
McConnell would like to cons
solidate the two dining areas into
one facility, Due to the high cost of
construction, he is looking into the
possibility of converting Darby
Gymnasium.

 

Turner stated that the idea of
using Darby is “not even at the
stage of being considered
seriously." However, McConnell is
now meeting with food service
consultants Bolton and Hey of Des
Moines to discuss options and
possibilities.

Turner. who suggested that this
will be discussed at the June
trustees meeting. wants to "l‘eVls.
both places and come up with a
price tag” for improvements. He
regretted that the Dober company
was not asked to investigate t
kitchen facilities. “Retrospec
tively that could have been a
mistake. it was simply not done,“
he said.

At the beginning at the week, as a
resultnf this so]; investigation,
Hawn initiated discussion with
Dave McConnell concerning im-
provements that could im-
mediately be made to both
facilities,

Until the investigation, ace
cording to Hawn, he had not b
notified of these problems.
