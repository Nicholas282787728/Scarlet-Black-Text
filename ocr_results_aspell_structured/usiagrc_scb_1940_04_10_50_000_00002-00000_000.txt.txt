Grinnell College

Grinnell, Iowa

April 10, 1940
Dear Ma:

I received your letter yesterday con—
gratulating me on my election to the house
council of my hall, and some of the things
you said surprised me so much that I
thought I’d better write you immediately

You said that now that I have been
elected a house officer I must enforce the
rules and regulations of the college and dor—
mitories if I am to be faithful to the trust
given me by the members of my hall.

I’m really disappointed that you should
have such a distorted perspective and sense

 

we've been thinking all
that old Grinncll is a mighty calm
reserved reservation.

for three years cultivating my plurality
carefully and being one of the boys, and
now you want me to stab them in the back
after they have elected me. Sometimes
your humor is so subtle that it scares me
into thinking you’re really serious.

Ma, I remember you told me yourself
that friends are the most important things
in the world Now you turn right around
and tell me that I should enforce the rules
and regulations against those same friends.
I’ve been elected on a platform to see no
evil, hear no evil, and keep my nostrils
clean; and I’m going to carry it out to the
best of my ability. A fellow can’t be a
ringer around here and last long.

I’m a student loader now, ma, and I
intend to be a good one.

Your loving son,
Willie.

 

OR IS lT'.l

Spring and sentiment have been inseparable
partners time out of mind. And we are
not talking of what Lord Tennyson had
to say, because anyway everyone knows
he was something of a fool. (As if he
thought he was Saying anything new.) We
are talking about the nice trite fundamental
distinction that crops up ill philosophy class
and English Literature 102, between being
reasonable and letting reason crawl back
between the covers of the Discourse on
Method and stay there. There is something
predominately rational about winter; it is
cold, and it stays cold, and it snows every
two weeks. But you come back from spring
vacation and see that there was grass un-
derneath it all the time, and the crocuses
are blooming south of the chapel, and Slid-
denly you begin doing what you want to do.

You go to the class and find half a
dozen forlornly conscientious classmates
leaning on the window sills; you join them,
somebody hails you from below, and you
find yourself Sitting on the porch of the
White House with a “coke” in your hand,
and you say, “What the devil, it’s spring
isn't it?”

But our heart is not in the giving of
advice which we have no intention of fol-
lowing. Besides, it may be snowing to-
morrow.

We used to or at least

of us even suspected the sinister,
outlandish schemes planned and
executed under our much olfac~
tory organs that the executors
might have an evening of very
unorthodox recreation. Props used
for one of the adventures into
"outer space" involved one fire
escape, cnc automobile and two
Cavaliers from lowc City. How-
ever, the automhile, an unreliable
invention in itself, Collapsed when
it collided with some immovable
object, and said gals had to hitch-
hike home. Props for the second
adventure include one automoble,
one Newton ‘coffee house' and one

dastardly damsels all dwell in

Hayworl'h Elected
Band President

Ballard Hayworth, junior resi-
dent of Rawson hall. was elected
president of the Grinnell college
band at a meeting of the .group
held Monday afternoon.

At the same meeting, Fred
Schaefer, Rawson hull, was named
business manager of the group,
and Echo Belle Booth. resident of
Haines cottage, was elected vice
president.

The band is planning is spring
concert for Friday, May 10, to
be held in Herrick chapel, and it
is possible the group might have
a. guest conductor for the concert.

Hitler’s Attack
Not a Case
Of Morals

—ByWII1llmO.H.-.rrls

Striking with staggering sudden-
ess, Adolph Hitler yesterday sent
his green-gray legions crashing
over the Danish frontier and into
pcsccful Norwegian fjords,

At this writing, the latest, but
still inconclusive report: indicated
that the Nazis peaceably occupied
Denmark and attained most of
their objectives in Norway. In
only the latter country was op-
position enccuntcrcd, the indica-
tions being that an eleventh-hour
ultimatum to Denmark convinced
that. government of the blind stuc
pidity of resistance.

 

In fact, the only great opposiv
tlon seems to have come from the
British squadron stationed in
Scandinavian waters. However, at
present, merely the vaguest ru-
mors indicating numerous en-
gagements between portions of
the English and German higlr
seas fleets have filtered across the
Atlantic, and any attempt to furor
tell the Significance of the naval
action is impossible,

 

This time, Britain and France
have promised full and immedl-
ate aid to the belcagnlcrcd Norwcr

in to the interior to organize
whatever second-line defense may
be possible. Just what measures
the allies are taking in support of
the peninsular country remain
obscured in platitudinous general-
izations and clouds of official
secrecy.

But even at this curly date, it
seems certain that, unllke the art—
promlscd but neverrgiven aid to
Finland. support for Norway will

soon be forthcoming in telling
quantities.
And that for one fundamental

reason: it is to Britain's advmb
tage to furnish such aid. Situated
as it is, a neutral Norway be-
comes vitslly important in any
British plan for winning the war.
German control of Norwegian raw
materials and trade routes would
obviously increase German
chances of defeating the block
ddc, upping the odds for a Nazi
victory.

Thus, the indications are that
the northern countries will once
more become the scene of ruthless
modern warfare. Moreover, just
because of this expected barhurr
ism, we in thc United States shall
again be subjected to a new out-
burst of "violated neutralities"
and "totalitarian atrocities."

From such a deluge of propa-
gandistic bilge we can not protect
ourselves, for each of the warring
powers will spare no effort in ac—
cusing its opponents of converting
Norwegian pastures into battle—
fields. But one thing, st least, we
in American can undertake: We
can insure our physical nonpor-
ticlpation by establishing an inocl-
lcctuul and emotional non-partici—
pation, recognizing that BOTH
combatants are responSlbleiBri—
tain for her violation of Norwe—
gian neutrality in laying mine-
fields in her territorial waters,
and Germany for her invasion of
Scandinavia to secure her sources
of supply threatened by English
mines .

We can, in short. THINK, re-
membering thst WAR KNOWS
NO “MORALS.”
