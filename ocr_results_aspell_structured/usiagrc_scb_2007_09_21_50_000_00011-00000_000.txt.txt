Why Democrats and pundits should recognize the Republican Party’s sway over voters

Yes,my Democratic triends, you have good
reason to be smilingithc zoos president
tial election is yours for the taking. Selecting
among your party’s most dazzling candidates
for the upcoming contest, you seem poised to
follow up your stunning zooo seizure of Con-
gress with an even more significant victory:
the capture of the
White House. Evt
erywherc. from the
corridors ofWashr
ington to the town
halls of Iowa and
New Hampshire,
the Democratic
Party has apparently con-re out on top after the
latest sea change in national politics, a reversal
that has sent the once triumphant and resilient
Republican Party spiraling.

Indeed, with the GOP at its lowest oflows
since Watergate, the Democrats have been the
primary beneﬁciary of rampant mass disillue
sionment now spreading among Americans.
The public wants to hold President Bush and
his party responsible for the mistakes of the
past eight years. Not surprisingly, polls have
shown that a majority of voters mam to ooze
DEriwrmru' next November and some pundits
have already predicted a Clinton or Oharna
general election Victory.

Unfortunately, such con»
clusions are considerably pres
mature, There is no reason to
assume that the Republican
Party is a sure bet to lose in
2008, especially with a new face
as its standard-bearer and es-
pecially when polls have shown
both Rudy Giuliani and Mirr
Romney running compctr
lively with Hillary Clinton and
Barack Ohama in hypothetical,
general election matcheups. Furthermore, it
would be a mistake to overestimate the impor—
tance of Democratic victories in 2006, when
the Democrats had to merely sit by, watch the

Republican Party selfedestruct and try hard
not to blow a chance to win control of Con-
gress for the first time since 1994.

The 2006 midterm elections demonstrated
the bankruptcy of Bush's presidency. not the
bankruptcy or conservative ideology. Despite
some predictions, the Republican Party is still
a force to be reck-
oned with. And as
a result, Demos
crats are fearful
that a presidential
election appears
ing to be stacked
in their favor may
not, in reality, end in celebration. Having lost
two elections they should have won in 2000
and 2004, this is more than a reiteration ofthc
familiar quip that the Democratic Party rpc-
rin/l'zcrrn losing elections it was
supposedly destined to wrn.

But why, when offered a
choice between a Democratic
candidare of change and a Ree
publican candidate ofcontinu-
ity, would the American people
chose another four ycars of
conscrvative rule? The answer
is simple.

with,

Although the Democratic
Party is the party of change, the
appeal at the Demoeraric pro
grain is undermined by rhe Ree
puhlrcan Party's ability to cont
trol and framc dcbatc. Indeed,
to have power over the way
the issues are presented to the
people and are discussed is to
have power over your opponent.
And it rs a power that is eritieal.
Through it the GOP has, time
and time again, hooked and
then hung the Democratic Party.

More than just a game of semantics, rhe
control of the debate has allowed Republicans
to continually put the Democratic Party on

Despite some predictions, ml u
the Republican Party is
still o forte to be reckoned

thc defensive, forcing Democratic candidates
to constantly explain their positions on Iraq
and tenor, rather than to talk about how they
plan to move the country forward in uniquely
Democratic ways. As a consequence, the same
public that overwhelmingly wants to vote
Democratic in November is concerned that
Democrats want to “cut and run" in Iraq and
that Democrats cannot be trusted “to hunt
down and mutdet"those who threaten our 5e»
curiry.

And it's a strategy that has worked remarks
ably. In 2004, instead of discussing how the
Bush administration putposefrilly used faulty
intelligence to build the case for war with Iraq,
John Kerry spent precious minutes explaining
to Americans why he had voted to authorize
a war he now opposed. In 2006, instead of
discussing how neoconservative policies had

lead to the creation ofa “global

jihadist movement" and an M,
increase in world tertot~
ism," Democrats were forced to
persuade voters that they could
be just as “tough on terrorism"
as the GOP, The result: ng/lm
and agent, the Demon/ll: on the
dtfeizliwc andoﬁtopr‘c
At a time when issues of national security
are of primary concern to voters, the Repube
licans have made Americans believe that the
Democrats cannot be trusted to forcefully
combat terrorism and to manage the war in
Iraq. Two lost presidential elections later,
Democratic candidates are vying with each
other to appear just as militant as the most
hawkrsh Republican. a tactical crtot that will
cost them grcatly,

Having lost control of the issues, the
Democrats, whom many pundits have (miss
takenly) picked to Win in 2003, have dug their
own graves before any vote was ever cast. This
election will end in celebration, but the party
doing the celebrating will not be the one most
at us had originally expected, or had hoped,
would win.
