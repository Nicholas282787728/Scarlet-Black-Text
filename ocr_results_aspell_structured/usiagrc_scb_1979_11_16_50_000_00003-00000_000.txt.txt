‘ :‘é The big news in Grinnell this week was, of course, Ted Ken~
\ nedy’s stop on campus. Though his talk was unimpressive, hosting
M-"I-m-n s u the person whom current polls rank as the favorite to be the next
“”5”“ president caused a good deal of excitement,
John Mandel and Jim Goodfellow report on what Kennedy had
hummum to say (page 4). In the ideas section, David J.L. Blatt takes a
M , philosophical look at the speech.
" ' This week‘s focus section features the culmination of weeks of
W I extensive research into the college’s physical plant department
at. u Hm $17,331., a _ We consider myths and realities of B&G; we profile Dale Hawn,
DJWCW“ ”WM " ' the director of the plant; we detail aspects of the plant’s opera-
smmm. m. tions.
“WW“ " ' The articles separate fact from fiction about the organization
7 i which is the butt of many campus jokes.
A special note of thanks goes to Grinnell Herald-Register News
Editor John Breemer, who provided valuable assistance on the
Darby bomb threat piece and the Grinnell State Bank robbery ar-
ticle.

Correction: Professor Walt Stone pointed out that we erroneous
ly reported in last week’s story on the Truman nominees that the
GPA requirement is 3.5; in fact it is only 3‘0 and the student must
be in the top fourth of his or her class.

We regret the error.
