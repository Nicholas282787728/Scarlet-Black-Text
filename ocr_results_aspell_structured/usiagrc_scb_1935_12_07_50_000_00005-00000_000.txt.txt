Watt Sees Good

Prep Season

for Cage Practice

 

”Because of the large number of
tall men on the squad, prospects
the freshmen team look
bright," Coach L. L. Watt declared
yesterday in discussing prep cagc
"We can put a team
on the floor that would average
over 6 it 2 in, in height' and a team
of such tall players always has a
big advantage," he‘added

A total of 35 freshmen have re-
ported during the first four days
of the prep cage drills. according
to Wall. This includcs some "Very
promismg" material, he believes,

Among giants of the squad are
Joe Woodward, 6 feet, 4 inches:
Robert Berry, 6 ft, 3 in: Wilbur
Luick, 6 fi‘. 5 in.: HoWard True, 6
aft. 3 ill; and James Cuttorth, 6 ft.
1 in, These five players ”look ex<
ceptionally good", but they will be
pushed hard for positions by ‘such
men as 'I‘ed Appiequist, Robert
Granny, Fred Luther, MacHobbs,
Robert Close, Vel‘ne Robinson, and
Joseph Nichals, all of whom have
displayed a good brand of basket-
lball, according to Watt,
