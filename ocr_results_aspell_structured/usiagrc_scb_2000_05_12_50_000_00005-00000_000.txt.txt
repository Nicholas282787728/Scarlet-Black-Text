CD REVIEW:
David Gray’s
‘White Ladder’

By Judy Pak
Daily Bruin (U. California-L05
Angeles)

 

(U-WIRE) The windows are open and
rhe rumbling rrucks roll pasr the small
house rn London where David Gray is re-
cording his rourrh, self-ﬁnanced album.
It’s anorher roarrul, hirrerswoer swoon
From rhc ludrcrously undcrrarcd musir
ciao.

“Who is David Gray?" is an advanmr
gcous quosrron bccausc his rclarrye arms
nyrniry will dismiss any expecrarions and
rorce us ro consider his music on some»
whar drrrerenr rerrns,

This dcpariurc is exactly whar he
needs ro avoid being rrapped by rhe
audience‘s wellvmcaning bur ulrimaroly
lrrnirrng expcciailons. The rcsolrs are
compelling and rhe album's richness and
melancholia grow on rho lisroner quickly

Gray enrwinos an unlikely allranca or
gonros w1rh a mlxiurc orcrarry, (cchnn-
likc boars, prarro and acousric guirar His
dramaric rinkering oisounds and unrouo

Dayo Maulicws signcd Gray or ﬁx a bed»

arrcr rourrng rogcihcr rn rhe us, We'll
lusl llavc ro wair and see wherher
Marrllcw’sarrcmprarbrlnglng Grnycomr
rnercial eureka in rhe srares wrll succeed.

The enhanced CD includes The nlnc
orrgrnal album (racks wirh rwo bonus
rracks, “Night Blindness" and “Babylon
11,” as well as a 12 minute video showing
phoros, inreryisws and conccrr iooiagc,

Gray's consciousncss-soaked voice is
supporred by eyeryrhing irorn violin ro
piano. Bur ar rimes, the drum maehrnc is
soundless. rho piano is hushcd, and Gray's
irrcorporcal guirar rainrly and lasringly
makes irs capxringing improssron.

In songs like “My Oh My," blighred
hope and immodorarion is expressed
rhrough balance orcray‘s raspy, plcadrng
voice and rhe guimr's conﬁdenr swing,
“Silver Lining" errrirs a sense orassuranco
and proves rhar love lsn'r rhs only smo—
rron rhar can rnaks- an impassioned song,

The mosr oursranding song is “Sail
Away," a lavish ballad when: rhc deep, res
yorbcrarirrg drums and alp-likc chord
climb really roilecr images orboars bnlr»
ing oilinro a glassy sea.

“While Laddcr" is bcsr cxpcricnccd
under a summer sky wirh a group or
friends dancing around in circles, stomp»
ing your Feel, and holding your sweetie
righr. Lerring rhc sonroor or your lerra
open and raking rhrce pals along for rhe
ride is closo enough, howeyor.
