Grinnell Co-ed‘s
Should Be Spoiled

If you tell a Giinnell college
woman that a person who is the
only child in the family is sure to
be "spoiled" you are likely to have
a young cyclone on your hands or
in your hair. In two chances out
of three, the person to whom you
are talking is either the only child
in the family, or one of two, and

families or only one or two chil-

last year show the same situation.
or 169 new women, 94 came from
the small families and so from
families of four or more,

Does this make any difference
in life in the quadrangle? “Um
doubtedly it does," says Miss Ever
Iyn Gardner, dean of women. “It
may mean that we have more
homesickness and that the girls
have a harder time adjusting them~
selves to living in a crowd than if
our girls came from larger fami-
lies. However, we have a happy
quadrangle in spite of the fact
that by tradition the only child in
the family is expected to be
spoiled.”

Reporter Finds
Only Two No. 13
Campus Rooms

The answer
Is

where is room 132
is usually another question:
there a room 137

A college should be above su-
perstition about unlucky numbers,
but until this September when the
new ground floor rooms were
there
were no rooms on the campus
numbered 13. Now we have 413G
in Haines and 5136 in Head, In
Alumni Recitation hall the rooms
are not numbered consecutively
but jump from 11 past the suppos»
ediy fatal number to 13. Were the
architects superstitious, or couldn't
they count? Neither Goodnow
nor Blair hails have numbers run-
ning higher than 10, and in Mar
goun hall all the numbers below
20 have been removed from their
places above the doors,

WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 16, 1936.

The only chance for finding a
13 was in the music building,
where room 12 has an unnum-
bered one beside it. A conversation
with Miss Edith Kendall, secre-
tary in the music department,
however proved that the unnum-
bered door belongs to room 11.

A call at the office of the dean
of men revealed that there are no
dormitory rooms numbered 13.
College central states that quad-
rangle rooms are numbered begin-
ning with 25,
