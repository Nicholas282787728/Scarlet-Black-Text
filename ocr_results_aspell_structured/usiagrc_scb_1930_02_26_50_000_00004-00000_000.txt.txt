iy Scandals" with Sally

k Egan, Carmel Myers; ii
Columbu production. Appearing at
the Colonial tonight, Thursday, and
Friday. - .,

Sally and Jack become stranded in
a tank town: their act has flopped.
They return to New York where Jack
gets the breaks. Mary hates to lose
him but thinks of his future The
seductive Carmel Myers is the chicken
in the egg, the fly in the ointment; in
short, she makes a triangle where a
knot is intended.

Egan has played Broadway and
Keithrorphellm circiit; Sally has been
with Fanchon and Marco and has a
rich screen eperience. The songs,
“What Is Life Without Love" and
“Kickin‘ the Blues Away" come from
the "Broadway Scandals," T h e
Broadway show shots are especially
good,

”Playing Around" with Aiioc
\Vhite and Chester Morris; a First
NationuLVimphone production. Ap—
pearing at the Strand tonight,
Thursday, and Friday.

The story, adapted from Vina Del-
mar's “Sheba,” presents Alice White
as the dissatistied stenograpber. The
boy friend’s theme song is "I Can‘t
Give You Anything but Love" but
the lad is unselfish.

Alice begins playing around but
allow us to inform‘-the anxious ones
that her purity remains unblemish—
ed. Shall we sing?

.The recording is good; it's
entertainment.

“The Vagabond Lover" with Rudy
Vailee, Sally Blane, Marie Dressler; a
Radio production, Appearing at the
Colonial Saturday. Sunday, Monday.
and Tuesday.

Rudy's one of the most faithful
pupils of Ted Grant's Correspondence
School of Music. But Mr, Grunt is
particularly warm when Rudy brings
his hand to New York for a. hearing.
Rudy gets in though, and in what
manner:

The Connecticut Yankees put out
some sweet music, especially their
novel arrangement of ,“Noliody's
Sweetheart Now.” Rudy has record—
ed for Victor most of the hits of this
Show: "I'll Be Reminded of You”, “I
Love You. Believe Me, 1 Love You,"
and “A Kiss Each Morning.”

We wish tu reiterate our belief that
Marie Dressler is one of the greatest
comedians on the stage or screen. Her
work in the "Vagabond Lover" is ex-
cellent.

“On With the Show" with Betty
Compson, Arthur Lake, Joe E,
Brown: a First National-Vitapliorio
production. Appearing at the Strand
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and
Tuesday. ‘

The glamour oi back stage life is
,always attractive to the layman,

iniler went the distance in 2 minutes
5 5‘10 seconds to better the old mark
by 3 9‘10 seconds. Gordon, holder
of the old record did not compete
against Grinnell, Ben Douglas, who
helped take the Bulldogs into camp
in basketball Friday, did his share at
the track meet also by doing 5 feet
8 inches in uie high jump to better
the old mark by .2 inch.

The entire aff ir was somewhat of
a surprise to the dopesters, who had
given Grinnell only a bare margin in
the affair. The Grinnellians have
been showing improvement steadily
under stiff outdoor practices, how-

good times for victory. The crack
Gl'innell mile relay team did not get
a chance to work Saturday. the Bulle
dogs forfeiting that event without
competing.

the dancing in “Show of Shows” and
“Hollywood R‘evue." Struggling

the necessity for novel effect.

The appearance of Ethel Waters
will be enjoyed by blues lovers, This
negress, who records some or Col-
umbia‘s best sellers, has become an
immense favorite in the past two

3 Campus Opinion

Questio Would you iavor k3];
ing the reading rooms in the library
open on Sunday alternoons‘?

Charles Lm'clmd: Yes. Often
times one has reference work which
must be done before Monday and
which is frequently hard to acc0m~
plish on Saturdays.

Mary Hayes: Yes, I think it is a
good idea—it is a good place to read,
. Russell Smith: I doubt If the num-
ber of students who would take ad-
vantage of it would pay for keeping
it open. The fact that reserve books
would have to remain in the library
over the week end would dis-
commode more Students that it
would benefit,

Mnry Davis: Yes. It is a nice place
for Students to read and Study if
they want to.

l Edward Brownbridge: I would he
in favor of it. The library makes
‘a quiet place to study here one will
Inot bother guests in the dorms, Vis~
‘itors are quite frequent on Sunday.

Elizabeth Lynda: Yes ,in the at-
itemoons. I think it would be used
by a good number of students as
well as faculty and townspeople.

John Kent: N0. give the librarians
a rest. No one studies on Sunday

anyway.
