gROM the ten visitors at the

men's gymnasium there
seems to be little interest in
work done there, Visitors
welcome from three to Six o'clock
every day and will ﬁnd it
more than worthwhile to pay :i
visit to the south gallery of the
gymnasium. The class work done
is the best since the gymnasium
was built and shows an interest-
ing side oi a student's develop-
ment,

EXT Wednesday \villoccur
Ea the meeting at the trustees,
when the teachers will be hired
tor the coming your. one of
oiirprolessorships is to be ﬁlled,
and theie isa strong sentiment
among part ofthe trustees in {as
vorof one candidate. While he
hope in case heischosemeiiery
tlttng will Show the choice a wise
one. we would be very sorry to
see anything like alenp in the
dark. Grinnell has had one bite
ter experience with radicalism
and in the interest of the college
does not want another. We Slur
cerely hope there is no such dan-
ger in this case. but we would
urge that every possible invcsti~
gation be made to see ii there nie
dangers of radical doctrines be
coming harmful to the college.
Over-caution will be better than
overeconﬁdencc in a choice that
isotso much importance, Iowa
College is :tarting on a new epoch
of growth, and while it is to be
hoped that there is no danger of
a check in this case. it is well to
look tivice betoie doing anything
doubtful.
