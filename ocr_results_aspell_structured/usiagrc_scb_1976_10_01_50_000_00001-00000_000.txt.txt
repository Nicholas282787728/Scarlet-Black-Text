marred by

vandalism

by Chris Lower

In the early morning hours of
Tuesday, Sept, 28. the grave
silence was shattered by splats
tering sounds as the ad-
ministration building was given an
unauthorized paint job , . one with
which lhe administration was not
pleased.

Dark brown paint was slung on
Ihe white clapboard siding, and
dribbled down the large columns
which dominate the lacia of Nollen
’tHouse. One small window was

The Grinnell police were also
called and a detective on the scene
recovered a plastic ”baggie,"
obviously used to apply the paint,
and immediately took it into
custody without a struggle. The
Grinnell police department is
conducting an investigation twhich
they declined to discuss) and are
checking the baggie ior linger-
prints.

 

The immediate assumption behind all the
initial reactions was that the act related to
the issue of student input in the adminis~
tra tive reorganization . . .

know the outcome oi the previous

Montgomery, Bob Handler and
Matt Cohen into his oftice, where
they presented a statement on

A organiz onai meeting

 

Last Monday night at 7:00 pm. a
meeting of concerned students was
convened in Political and Cultural
House (Pine Tree House) to
discuss the administrative
reorganization in the aftermath of
last week's open iorum, It soon
became apparent that the
designated meeting place could not
possibly accomodate the sixiysplus
students who eventually turned out
lor the occasion, and the group
transplanted itself at Gardner
Lounge,

Called by the newly formed
Organization for Student Action
tOSA), the meetings primary
purpose was to bring together all
student organizations which still
leel that student action is ap
propriate with regard to this
summer's reorganization Each
group was asked to prepare a
statement of intent on behalfof its
Constituencyi so that notes would
be compared and common goals
assessed.

Dan Hexter, representing the
Concerts Committee, was first to
‘speak, reiterating the Committee's
concern tor the iuture of the
program without Georgia Dentel,
He felt that they had been well-
received by the administration,
and outlined some of the options
which the committee has been
discussing with Dean Walker. One
possibility which has been
discussed with Walker is putting
Georgia Dentel on the college
payroll in a minimal capacity land
at a minimal salary) outside of her
current social calendarsplanning
function, This is in order to provide
her with the various benefits ac~
cruing to college employees li.e..
group health plan, etc). and to
give her an official accountability
to the College. The Concerts
Committee might then ask SGA ior

iunds to make up the remainder of
a liveablesalary and employ her to

book campus entertainment and
tilms,

llexter lhcn urged anyone with
other possible alternatives to
suggest them to the committee.
These would be compiled . d
presented to the administration.
Asked what portion of MS. Dentel's
salary SGA might be asked to put
up, Hexter replied that that would
depend on Dean Walker, Ruth
Montgomery, SGA president, was
quick to pointout that working on a
tight budget, as SGA does,
anything extra, such as this salary,
would require cuts in other areas.
l-lexter answered with the example
that “Asleep at the Wheel," which
appeared here last weekend. was
obtained for $2,750, The same
group brought $10,000 in Des
Moines Hexter feels that “her
talents at booking bands cheap
will compensate for the tact that
some of our booking money is
going toward her salary” it some
oi the general activities tee is
tapped ior her rehiring

Ruth Montgomery. speaking for
SGA. restated lhe three points on
which they take issue with the
reorganization: lack of student
input, degradation oi the social and
recreational programming and
lack of affirmative action SGA
distributed a sheet outlining |his
stand aiid'proposing iive speciiic
possible alternatives to the ﬁring
oi Georgia Dentel. son has given
Mr, Turner and Mr. \ alker a list of
agencies which'speciiically otter
placement ior women in ad-
ministrative positions. They have
also drawn up a set oi tentative
guidelines ior the preparation oi a
speciiic aiiirmative action policy.
They hope to work with Dean
Eysenbach in establishing a

Last Tuesday. [or the first lime
in 17 years. the Gl'innell'NCWlleg

almost immediate end to split

Junior high school to the south part
of Grinnell

Not all iaculty however were

whcther the bond issue was the

oi the bond issue solves the most
immediate problems brought on by
