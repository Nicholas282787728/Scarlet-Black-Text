Survey finds Bookstore policy, prices

by lrwan Makagiansar

There has been a great deal of
debate concerning the high cost at
the college bookstore this year
Many students, including SGA
representatives, have suggested
that the administration should
work to reduce the book prices
and possibly even organize a “cor
op” bookstore.

This week the 5&3 has con
ducted an informal survey of book
prices which does not provide con-
slusive statistics. yet does give a
good indication of the prices.

Two oi die most expense books
are found in the science departs
menl and one in the math depart
ment. These books are lengmy
and are hardcovers. In addition.
three of the most expensive in-
troductory course books were
irom the math department.
science department art depart-
ment, These are books that are in
high demand because of the
popularity of the courses.

Furthermore, classes in the
departments of political science,
sociology. and history encompass-
ed a few of the most expensive
classes offered mis semester. The
average for each of these was ap
proximately $90.00. These books
include both a large number of
soft and hardcover books.

On the other hand. the survey
found that three of the least ex-
pensive classes are in the math,
philosophy, and history departs
merits with an average cost of
$7.50. It was also approximated
that typical course loads cost
close to an average of $165 each
semester.

Thomas McBee. the bookstore
manager, felt that there has been
some misunderstanding among
students concerning the bookstore

policy. He said that the prices of
the books are not going to come
down for two reasons. First, the
college subsidizes the bookstore,
therefore the bookstore is part of
the college, not a private business
He noted ”the operation costs of
the bookstore is larger than the
profit made on textbooks”.
Secondly. the book prices are pre-
determined by the publishing
company. he said.

To reduce the expensese that
students face each year, McBee
proposed that there should be a
closer cooperation amongst faculr
ty and students. He emphasized
that students should encourage
ther proiessors to enter the “buy
back” book lists Well before the
end oi the year to allow the
bookstore to acquire used books
needed for the coming academic

year by purchasing them from
students at half price. Henceforth..
students in the fall could buy them
at a lower price instead oi buying
them brand new.

McBee also suggested, that
books which are assigned for very
short excerts be instead put on
reserve at the library to reduce
student expense.

According to McBee “the cost of
paying $200 each semester is of
small amount compared to the
cost spent to go to college.” He
mentioned that the amount spent
for these textbooks should be con-
sidered worthwhile as these books
shape and contribute tremendous
ly to the students’ education.

McBee said he hopes that
students wil come and ask more
questions regarding the bookstore
policy and he concluded “we are

Proposal would slow JB process

This Wednesday. Joint Board
discussed how students' opinions
about political issues should be
communicated to SGA.

lan McLean submitted a resolur
tiun he said would “improve
SGA'S representation of issues
which aiiect students.” The
resolution requires that hall
presidents allow students in his or
her dorm to vote on any “national
and international political issue."
This way. the hall president's vote
will reflect the desires oi the ma
jority.

The resolution provides a
specific procedure {or student in-
terest in political issues to be com-
municated to SGA, Debate at this

News _
Analy81s

week’s meeting centered on how
adoption of this resolution would
affect student's ability to coma
municate their opinions on inter-
national issues and the SGA's
ability to act on them.

Increased student interest in
SGA’s role in national and inter-
national politics (as demonstrated
by the election of an SGA
presidential candidate supporting
SGA involvement in political ac
tivities) requires that an effective
way be found ior SGA to represent
student opinion. But, as Raf Stein
mentioned. “We must be very

careful about how we set up the
system.”

McLean’s proposal has a
number of drawbacks that were
discussed during the meeting. l-lis
method oi hall voting (having pear
pie sign their name in “oppose”
and “approve” columns) denies
students their right to private
ballot. as Raf Stein pointed out,

Joint Board then discussed ex-
actly what issues McLean intends
ed students to vote on. Matt
Golden decided that this resolu-
tion would “reduce every political
decrsion to a referendum.” It is
true that now many SGA discus
sions on political issues do not
become referendums. and forcing
SGA to transform each discussion
into a referendum would be time
consuming.

But when SGA discussions
result in letters expressing stu»
dent opinins. Joint Board votes
whether or not to accept that let-
ter. In these cases, a student vote
Could be taken in the dorms, as the
new resolution suggests McLean
feels this system would better
represent students because it
would recognize their opinion on
every issue,

David Mathias disagreed and
said that instead it would destroy
SGA‘s role in national and inter-
national politics. If students dic-
tate how each representative is to
vote on each issue. the argument
goes, then what need is there for a
representative at all? Mathias
concluded. “As hall president, 1
carry your vote, Nothing else.
This resolution seems like the

same thing as voting SGA down.”

Reiection or acceptance of die
McLean resolution will reflect
how the student body feels about
SGA’s involvement with national
and international politics.
McLean’s proposal will drasticalr
1y change SGA's methods for deal
ing with political ailairs.

If it is accepted. SGA will lose
its power as a representative body
and will become moderators in a
true democratic system. If it is
not accepted, SGA will retain its
position as the governing body of
the students, elected to represent
those students.

Silent
Assembly

o q ct -
by Owen Charles

Approximately 70 people stood
silent for 10 minutes outside Dara
by gymnasium last Friday, April
5, In recognition of women
athletes and their absence from
the Grinnell Sports Symposium.

Organizers of the event were
Mary Jane Constant. Mari
Gasiorowicz, Sandra Laursen.
and Anne Wiberalske all, of whom
issued press releases to the major
and local media attending the con»
ference.

The press release read as
follows:

“Members of the Grinnell Col-
lege community are gathering to-
day to recognize and honor the
women athletes not participating
in the Symposium on SporLs and
the National Character sponsored
by the college this week. The
predominantly male experience
oi sports as depicted by the sym-
posium reflects the subordinate
status of women’s sports in
American culture. Society poses
obstacles to the female athlew
throughout her life:

‘ insufficient encourage
ment to be active and athletic;

‘ low standards for
measurement of achievement:

‘ the non-athletic and weak
image or women in the media;

- secund~rate iunding and
facilities for high school and
college teams;

" the lack of prestige for
women's athletics. especially
ior team sports.

“The purpose oi the silent
assembly is to bring these ine-
quities to the attention of the cam-
pus community and the nation.
The group will observe ten
minutes olsilence at noon today in
iront oi Darby Gymnasium in
order to honor both the women
who, despite opposition, have suc-
ceeded as athletes, and the
women who have been unable to
surmount those obstacles. Your
support (is welcomed and an
preciated."

Aiter opening remarks by
several organizers and the in
minutes of silent the assembly
was concluded with the statement
“We were silent because We are
tired of words, we want action."

Asked later what the assembly
had achieved. Constant asserted,
'“It made people aware that ine-
quities in'athletics do exist, The
first step in any social change is
awareness,"

Aside from obvious inequities in
society at large, Constant noted
several at Grinnell: “In Grinnell,
the solthall team plays on the field
that is off-campus and doesn't get
to practice in Darby, they don't
have equal equipment to the
baseball team; women's soccer
remains a club with much less
funding than other teams, and
must play‘on the 10th Avenue iield
which is in bad condition.”

Constant also noted that women
are “often left on the side-lines in
l.M. athletics."

Wiberalske also noted that
men's teams have greater alumni
support and that this is “a way of
