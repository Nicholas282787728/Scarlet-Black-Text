Cat policy changes to be proposed

Possible resolution aims to allow students to keep cats in residence halls

by]. FRANCIS Busrz

Along with clouds or crgnrcttc smoke and misplaced fire
extinguishers, dashing Cats arr: an occasional sight in residence
halls. While cats are currently banned from rcsidcncc halls,
talks between students and administrators have raised the pOSr
sihility that cats may become acceptable dorrn residents.

Current pct policy at Grinncll prohibits students from
keeping cits in residence hall. According to
the Grinncll Student Handbook,
any found Cats “will be removed
without notiﬁcation.” But a future
resolution in SGA may ciringe the
blanket bin r \inst cits.

SGA VicerPr'esident of
Student Affairs John Burrows
said several students have up
prottched SGA “with compi s that they
are no longer allowed to have cats in their
dorm rooms irrer they've responsibly taken
care ofcats their whole time here at Grrnnell,"

These concerns prompted Btu-rows to contest

current policy mid advocire that students

be allowed to own cats under certain Conr
ditions,

Burrows said he has begun dialogue .
between hrmsclf, Dean of Students Travis
Green: and the Residence Life Commit—
tee regarding ways to potentially (hang:
the cat policy. "[We] will be tackling the is-
sue by looking at what our pCCr inst'tutions
are doing and any other current pol' cs out
there," Burrows siid,

currenrly, seveml cats live in residence
halls across campus. Last year in Loosehcad alone, RLC and
Assistant Director of Residence Life Kim HindsrBrush said
she approached three students who owned cits, nsking for the
pets to be removed.

”I am worried that propel are going to
leave their (at in lli€ll room for two weeks
aveispiing break.”

Assistant Direaorfo Resident Life and RLC

Ashley Bennett‘ll said that the car she owns has not led to
problems with FM or other students on her ﬂoor. Instead, Ben-
nett said the ﬂoors commrrnity has benefitted from the pres-
ence ofhcl ent, Pasha. “l thinka cnt's good for the community,"
Bennett said. “If that’s what the school wants, they should ac-
cept proposnis tor ccltaiil pets ror ccrrnnr purposes."

But while she said that the cat has been good for her ﬂoor,
she understands why the policy exists “It takes a Certain kind
orperson to mice cnre of pers,"Bcnnetr said. “I utidcrstand the

logic behind the policy."
Hinds-Brush cited (11!: transrencc ofcollcgc
students is a chicr concern in regards to cot
ownership. “During the summer and breaks
where does the cat go>“ HindseBr h
said. “I get worried that pcopie are going
to leave their cat in their room for two
weeks ovcr spring hrcnk,"

According to HindSrBrush, other
concerns included cleanliness issucs and
students who object to n cnr living on
thcir ﬂoor. Because of concerns

with disagreements benreen

dents,Burrows cited the possib' r}

of looking into pctrfriendly dorms or
ﬂoors.

HindseBrush snid that any changr
es. ifapproved. would likely not take
effect until the next academic year.
“My guess would be it will be pre
sented next semester and if rt passes
it won’t be until next year," she said.
“And that’s a big if."

According to the student hand-
book, ”nonpoisonous birds, rodents (except fErrCts), reptiles,
amphibians, ﬁsh, or invertebrates” are allowed in residence
halls.
