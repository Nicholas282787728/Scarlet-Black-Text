How does onc begin stter the
summer's layoli"? simple, one
greets the entering freshmen.
And a sterling group of tre re
men we have; most ot them, 1
understand. were in top admin-
ist.ative positions in their res
spectii-e high schools. and at
le- t oire is said to have been
re ~uited by Grinnell tor the
sole purpose oi revising our
cutriculum. An extraordinary
lot, these treshmeii; valedictor—
iaus. honor students . . , young
Bertrand Russell: and Eve Cur-
ies. unquestionably.

The iew tiny doubts that
skulk in the bat-tr oi my nrind
will no dorrbt be dispelled
“he“ the ii-eshineir get into
the classroom; those lcw who
seem ullilble to, coirrmnnicate
in English will succeed beyond
the administration‘s wildest
press releases, and those oth-
ers tpcrliaps not quite so few)
“ho seem totally lacking in
the social graces will doubt-
lcss lie the lions of Union so~
ciety within a week

Frcshmcu, I welcome you.
You humble and bed; zle me
atcth the glitter oi your poten—
tial, but i am only too glad to
be associated with you, Welcome
. welcome each and all.
c e .

Right on. betore the academic
ytzn‘ begins to rareen by.
should like to hazard a suggese
tion to the tarnlty (or to the
administration, 01‘ whoever is in
charge ol the examination set—
up). The suggestion is this: that
dcﬁnitc. inviolablc dates tor
exams be set at the beginning
oi each semester, and that. on
those dates, all hour exams in
at: departments be given.

That is. tllcre would be two
periods oi, say, three days
each, spaced about equally iii
the semester and devoted ens
lu-ely to one» or two-hour
exam atious in ever ulu'cct.
During the testing per ds tas
during nrialst there would be
no tor-trial classes held, and.
while this might reniler the
idea unpalatable to some prar
fcssors (either too cloistered
to understand or too sadistic
to care obout the realities oi
exa’mrtaliing), the plan still
has undeniable merit.

First oi all, given three days
ii-to which to ht his exam, the
potessor could somewhat en~

ge upon the punv 50—minute

-t given eurrentl he could,
Ii he wished. really load it on.
J\nd the student. in those same
three days. would. be pushed
and pressed and driven to near
collapse.

But attcr three days he would
in ﬁnished for three or tour
necks; there would he n_o
s'cady, selncstcrdong drizzle ol'
C'mnls. one or two a week .

i

The student might have i,
time, iii the interim, to sit ‘;
down and write a decent pa. l
p and the professor might
enjoy reading ope not written
in haste and protracted ane
guish.

It's only a suggestion 'l
but those in tavor oi sanity
might do well to consider it.

“All oiiis . . . , '

. . . have an obligation to ' rclcll our tidy little brallls
to try to unders and world all rs. Tile world is here, and
lion, and on cvel'ylnan's doorstep, ever notice?”

thVerue Hull in the “Wilnlion Democrat"

One of the most enjoyable experiences of our sulnmel"
was the discovery that we again had time to r dd about
what was happen lg outside of the campus microcosm, to
explore the various f cets of our own country alld the
other powers of todh 's uorld.

We found that, after a year on campus, our kllo\\'lctlgc
had deteriorated to Lhc point where nrdny news stories
were unintelligible because we didn’t have significant baci-
ground 7 in fact we couldn’t even read “Li’l Abner" \l‘lihr
out a parental refresher.

The ivory lower 01' the academic community is com»
fol-table. We ("ind here a cushion that protects us adequately
from the blows of the daily headlines. Now, utilizing a
t ,000 grant, the college hopes so to revise the interna-
tiollal affairs program that we “ill be almost forced to
remain ill Contact. How inconsiderate of our youthful sene
sibilities!

No, it is not inconsiderate—rather it is among the
wisest moves made by the college ill our time on campus.
Recognizing- n deep need of the student body, President
Bowen addressed last night’s convocation in words coll-
veyillg all unmista able challenge.

We cannot a 0rd to become so buried in our books
that we cannot relate our liberal arts education to the hap—
penings of today. It is our responsibility to ourselves, as
well as to society to develop into thinking, constructive
people. This we can only do by utilizing otlr klloulcdges in
the light of present needs. When our learning is coin-
pleteiif ever it shall begwe “ill be faced by the acid
test—does what we know in ally way explain where we
Callie from, what we are doing, where we are going. and
why”?

These are man’s most basic questions and the ultimate
stage in our intellectual development is the utilization of

our “bookelnrning” to explain life to ourselves and thus

eitller to accept it' or to reject it, in favor of that which
our minds deem to be superior. The one who can do these
things is the liberally educated person we are striving to
become,

Opinions of Americans

Knowing that Americans ale
