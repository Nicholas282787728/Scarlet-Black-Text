.AfrorAmerican Literature
position remains unfilled

by Mark W, Schumann and Darrell Hall

Next year, for the third straight year,
Grlnnell College will go without a porn
manent proiessor to teach Afro»
American literature. The faculty Ex-
ecutive Council has decided by a split
vote not to recommend the hiring oi
Proiessor Robert Butler aiter ha'ving
extended invitations to two previous
candidates. who declined the position
because of other offers elsewhere,

Butler, who teaches Afro/American
Literature at Canicius College, in New
York. and who is white, was recomr
mended by the English Department
faculty and student Educational Policy
Committee alter he visited campus to
deliver lectures and to meet with
students and faculty, “We really liked
him . , We all iclt pretty comfortable
with him." said Lisa McGahey. SEPC
chair. of her committee's reaction to
Butler. but admitted that “there might
be some tension at first and some pro-
blems,” Likewise, the English Depart-
ment was impressed enough with
Butler's credentials to recommend him
for an appointment,

The details of Butler's dossier are not
available but he was said to have nearly
twenty years of experience including
time spent teaching in Attica Prison,
New York. it was also reported that the
major part oi Butler’s career was spent
teaching in black colleges in the South.

For the larger part oi the academic
year, the English Department had been
searching for a candidate to fill the va-
cant AfrosAmerican literature position,
This year’s search was actually a cone
tinuatlon of one started in the 198371984
academic year which was suspended
when questions were raised about the
searching procedures and the status oi
more than one candidate. The ad-
ministration would not allow the
department to invite one candidate to
campus because she was a white
woman. in addition, the former direc-
tor of Minority Affairs and some
students raised the question of whether
Professor Kenneth Chambers, who fill-
ed the position temporarily, was being
given serious consideration in the
search for a permanent teacher.

In January of 1984, President Drake
made it Clear to James Kissane. then
chair oi the English Department. that
no nonsblack candidate would be ac-
cepted for the position. Kissane felt that
the advertisement for the position, was
then a dishonest statement. In protest,
Kissane resigned as chair but retained
his teaching post.

Elizabeth Dobbs replaced Kissane as

chair and therefore took over the
responsibility for the search, Because
she was continuing a search that was
already in progress. Dobbs was not
allowed to make substantive changes in
the wording of the advertisements, but
did remove the claim that Grinnell was
an “equal opportunity" employer.
Dean of Faculty Catherine Frazer
stipulated then that prospective can-
didates could be told of the college's
policy to consider only blacks for the
position over the phone but not in
writing.

Hobbs said that it would be unfair to
have non-black candidates travel to the
conference of the Modern Language
Assomation. one of the central
marketing places lor career positions
in the English iield. in order to apply for
a job for which they would not be con-
sidered.

0n the nth of September. 1984. Drake
informed Dobbs that. for legal reasons,
the college could not conduct a search
exclusively ior black applicants. The
Search then continued without that
racial restriction. By December the
department had received 23 calls
didates. This field was narrowed to 22
when Chambers was suspended from
teaching duties at the college and was
banned irom campus just before the
end of the first semester. Thirteen oi
these candidates were to be interview-
ed at the MLA convention in January of
this year.

According to Linda Johnsrud. the Col-
lege's Affirmative Action Officer. the
College had conducted "a very vigorous
search" for women and minority cans
didates. Johnsrud, who is responsible
for overseeing the recruiting process to
ensure that minorities and women were
actively sought. said she was well
satisfied that the College had taken pros
per steps to find suitable black can-
didates for the position.

As a result oi the interviewing pro
cess. four candidates were invited to
visit the campus. The top two can
didates. who were both black men,
were offered the Job but declined in
favor oi other opportunities. The third
candidate recommended by the depart-
ment. Butler, was rejected by the EX-
ecutive Council. which is composed of
seven voting members selected from
the faculty. The remaining candidate
was not recommended by the depart
ment to be hired.

Members of the Executive Council
expressed the most concern about
Butler's age,

ltcnction to the decisions of the a
iiiiiiistraiion and the executive counc
\terL- mixed. Frazer cited “th
pl’cscllt‘e at a minority iacult
nicmbe " as a very high priority in th
Council's decision Asked whether sh
it hold support the hiring oi a nonrblac
in the post, she answered that “

Pl'esrdenl that it's a high priority
i-‘i-azei- said that two criteria wou
have to be met before she would reco
mend a lionrblack: that the colle
"had exhausted all reasonable effort
to recruit a highly qualified black fee
I y member; and that the non-black c'
didale must have qualifications
great that they nould overtake any
vantage held by a black.

Quentin Johnson. Director oi Min
ty Affairs. agreed, butcxpressed re:
vatlons about the College's recruitm
of black faculty in positions other t
AerVAmerican Literature. "l'm

the traditional kinds oi advertisi

Johnson said he agreed with the
sicii of Drake and Frazer to can
only black candidates in the
analysis. saying that "Black stu.

He cited two faciors that contri-
