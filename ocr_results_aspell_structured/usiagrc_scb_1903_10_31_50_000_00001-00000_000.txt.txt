Enabﬁeld Re-organtzcdiCarson on Duty
at Full—back—Barbcr is Crippled.

The Withdrawal of thley from
the football squad seems to have

been the signal for a general

shake tip of the back ﬁeld. Rob
inson's made it

recovery has

possible for him to resume opera~
tions and he takes his old position
at left half which place Gilley
has abdicated, Carson has been
shifted to full back and Blea

master, formerly of the scrubs,
now does duty at right half,
Fuller, thus supplanted at full

- back by Carson. takes his place
in thelinc where he has been doing
efﬁcient work this week against
the scrubs. \Viththis set ofbacks
our charges should become harder
as the change has brought a
heavier man to the full back's
position and it sacriﬁces little in
speed and efﬁciency of the halves.
Carson's superb defense is soil
where it can be brought into play
while the speed of both Robinson
and Bleamastcr matter of
common remark. As atvholc, the
team stood well the knocks and
bruises ol the Iowa game although
Barber who entered the game
handicapped \\‘tth a severe Char»
ley liorsc came out of it with more
troubles tltan he carried in. The
stiffness oi his leg will work
greatly to his disadvantage in the
game today. Handel has again
appeared in football clothes and
will soon be ready to take back
his place in the line. His pres-
ence there can not failto strength-
en our defense.
