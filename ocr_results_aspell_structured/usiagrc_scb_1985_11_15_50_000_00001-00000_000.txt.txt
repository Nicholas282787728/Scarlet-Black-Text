"Continmty and Change oi Foreign Policy
in the Gorbachev Regime "

Proi‘essor Pipes immigrated irom
Poland in 1940. received his PhD Irom Har-

iaculty since that time. lie has a
distinguished career having served as the
director i)l East European and Soviet AD

lists published right books on Russia and

Pipes” pessimism concerning the up
coming Genera summit stems irom the
complexity- or the ties lacing Gorbachev
and Reagan and - either are experts."

leaders and said President Reagan has

Last week the Library and Bookstore
Committee met to discuss the problem
created by the growing number oi books
that are taken irom, Burling Library

without being checked out and possible

solutions to this problem,

The problem oi unauthorized borrowing
irom Burling was brought to the attention
or the Library and Bookstore Committee
uitei- a study iouiid that it had increased by
over intro books and periodicals in the last
iive years, in the study prepared by
Associate Libr ~ian Anne Kintllcr. the
number unauthorized Book and periodical
loans was shown to have increased irom
Mill) volumes in toiiuai to 2626 volumes in
iaoiras.

The study goes on to report that the
library spends seep per year in labor costs
ior searches on books which are reported
missing, Moreover. the study shows that
irom a circulation oi robots books and
periodicals in midrib, over eight percent oi
the volumes that leitdurling Library were

iigorous“ . id Pipes. Another plus i’oi-

economic problems oi ilie Soviet Union.

Pipes was also asked about the risk or

Pipes responded "I would phrase that dif-

almost certainly go nuclear. but the

great inconvenience that is caused by
students who keep books ior- an entire
