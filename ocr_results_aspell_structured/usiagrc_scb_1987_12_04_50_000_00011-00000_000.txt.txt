One
Credit of
Fun

by susan nolh

There is one part or Grinnell's
athletie program which receives
little, it any, newspaper coverage,
What most people learn about it is
through word ot mouth, and
through is descriptions in the
Grinnell College catalogs and
course selection guides It is one
credit physicalcducation coursu,
meeting once or twice a week,
dcpend' g an the activity, and ihey
are vi led uy the students who
take them in various ways.

As to the reasons tor taking an
elective kE. course, although the
usual ones are loslhy in shape or to
learn a sport, thereare also other
motives. For instance, Br: a
junior, played tennis, he . ild,
“number one. to keep ﬁt durin-g’ the
oriseasim ill a varsity sport. and
number two, to make sure that I
woke up early on days [Ital ldldn'|
have any classes. so I could get
some work done," 'I'tml, another
junior, eited wanting a credit and
the tact that several All his rricnds
were taking the class among his
reasons

Among the students interviewed,
most tell that they had gotten out
ot the class what they expected,
although there were some who
didn't think that they had learned
or improved as much as they had
hoped Even then, the majority,
when asked, said that they would
take hotherP.E.course

similarly, the malority or
students interviewed stated they
would recommend taking a PE
enumc, provided that interested
students approach the course with
the right attitude, As nrad em-
phasizes. “if you don't so in to be
eompetiliyc. a iye experience
will result." sim rly, Kristin, a
treshman, points out that
“everyone is given a {air ehance.
and no one is expeclcd to be. pro "
The benetii or regular exercise is ,
another reason tor recommending
the courses, because, according to
Tom. “it helps you to exercise
regularly when a lot or people
wouldn't otherwise "

greatness and the uniqueness ot
the competing institutions
(“founded in 1378, B so, has been
a leader in educating and
enlightening the ruture or
America....”)7 But perhaps the
biggest reassurance the viewer
gets that this is a college sporting
event comes in the graphics about
the players Besides the vital stats ‘
of height, weight, hometown, and
year, the graphic tells the viewer
the major or the player,

When the screen shows the ma
jor ot the player. look closely at the
type of majors the athletes study,
Look to see how many or the
athletes are majoring in com-
munications, and odds are that
these athletes are getting credit Ior
being interviewed on television,
Look to see how many athletes are
majoring in the same subject. and
odds are that there is e protessor in >
that department who doesn’t care
it the player doesn't show up to
class. In the recent Nebraska
Oklahoma game, the majority of
Sonnets majored in “undergraduate
Studies.” Iowa Hawkeye heroes or
years past, Greg Stokes and
Michael Payne, majored in
“general studies." By the time
senior year rolls around, a student
should be able to decide on a nar-
rower iocus at study, But these
athletes don’t have the time to
learn one subject intensively. They
were hired by the coaches to play
their sport. There are dire Conser
quences it a player's education im-
pedes perrormance on the lield.
Just ask Bob Balesente. As coach
at the Kansas Jayhawks, he was
tired because he did not win a
game in the Big Eight. The tact
that the Iootball team’s GPA was
raised trom 2.0 to 2.5 was irreler
vant. For bigtime college
athletics, the athlete must come
beiore the student.

At Grinnell College, we the
sports ians are watching true col
lege athletics. The athletes who
are on the tield or court or in the
pool are as much students as they
are athletes. There are no
“general studies” majors at Grin-
nell. The athletes here are
Chemistry, Russian, or English
majors. A student in your
Shakespeare class may be the
same person you are rooting toe on
the playing ﬁeld. Come graduation
time. the Grinnell athlete will have
earned the same credits in are
same manner as any other Grin-
nell student. Grinnell won’t be in a
bowl game and Al McGuire won’t
he coming to Derby, and they
shouldn‘t. Grinnell’s athletics are
not tor the networks; they are tor
the students. Grinnell College
shows the essence oi colloge‘
athletics, or true students playing
their sport simply ror enjoyment,
which is not what will be shown on
television in December.
