Cheerleaders Up In Air Aboul" Supporl'

Jnmos junior.

Card cheers and tiunbling will
soon be a part of the ,on'unell
cheering routine, according to the
six lively people pictured chore,
niemliers,ot this year’s cheering
squad. Feeling that “alldielhce
'liaxticipaﬁoh" card cheering can
be a iaotor in coordinating the
cheering oi the leaders and the
stands, Grimell’s cheerleaders
are hoping to initiate them during
the coming basketball season.
“It is the students duty to
support the team. and they can
do this only through active part

ticipation in cheering." said Rodl

Harrison. speaking for the squad.
"There must he a mutual feeling
of enthusiasm on the part of both
the cheerleaders and the stands.”
The 1,948 squad is two stronger
than its predecessor. and includes.
for the first time in many years.
an equal number cl men and
women. Jeannette Gustafson and
Jane Gunderson were members
of last year’s group. Three of the
new members have had previous
training at other colleges and
high schools.
To Get New Sweaters
Due to the cooperative efforts
of the student council and var-
ious halls, new sweaters Will
soon be provided for the entire
squad.~ Thus far, they have had
no uniforms due to the same
shortage of funds which has kept
them from accompanying the
team to any out of town games
except last week's Cornell game.
Sister organization to the cheer-
ing squad is the pep club, organ-
ized last year to promote wider
knowledge of cheers and develop
pie-game enthusiasm. The bonfire
and torchliglit parade during
Homecoming weekend climaxed
this season’s pep club activities.
Long, Obscure History

history. Though football was
