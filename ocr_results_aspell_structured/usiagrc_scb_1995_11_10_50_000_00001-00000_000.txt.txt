Efforts to diversify staff continue

BRIAN WAGNER
STAFF WRITER

Grinnell College is trying to di«
versify the cultural representation in
every faculty and staffdepartment to
meet the growmg demands of stu»
dents.

Although diversity within the
academic faculty and student serVic—
es staff has always been a major con-
cern, it is receiving more attention
because of increased student was
sure. as seen in student protests last
semester and the recent foiiiiation of
the DiversityinitiativesCommittee.

Recently, the Office ofStudent
Affairs has been working with rhe
Foweshiek County Mental Health
Center to create a professional faculr
ty that can meet the needs of the
College's diverse student body,

SiclindaCantysElliott,Assistant
Dean of Student Affairs, is organiz—

ing an internship or practicum for a
couriselorofcolorat the Center with
the graduate department at rhe Uni—
versity of Iowa. The College will
subsidize the cost for a graduate stu—
dent to work at the Center while
they complete their degree. But, the
budget restrictions of the Mental
Health Center make a permanent
position for a counselor of color in.
feasible.

Canty—Elliott will be bringing
candidates from the University to
Visithnnell[hissemesterandhopes
to secure an internship for next se—
ruestcr.

The Office of Student Affairs
has also had success this year in di.
versifying the Residence Life Staff
and Student Staffpositions. “That‘s
something that didn't happen last
year," says Tom Ctady, Dean otStu—
dent Affairs. “We've been trying to
do this for years."

With academic faculty, the pro-

cess of diversification has always been
difficult because ofthe limited num—
ber of minority candidates, “We
have to do a much better job of
creating a pool," says College Dean.
Charles Duke. “We have to be more
active."

Duke sees long—term success in
this goal through the development of
referral networks with past faculty
and With the graduates of the Con-
sortium fora Stronger Minority Pres—
ence at Liberal Arts Colleges. These
resources Will create a broader candir
date pool for the College.

Also, Duke would like ro see
expansion in the Minority Scholars
in Residence program. Unlike the
CSMP program. rhis program brings
scholars who can reach multiple
courses in the semesretor year. Yet,
current funds for the program do not
allow the College to support many
extended residences,
