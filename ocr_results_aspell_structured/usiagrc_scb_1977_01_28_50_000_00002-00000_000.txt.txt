The college-commissioned
housing study, issued in its final
form this month by Dober and
Associates, recommends that
Grinnell College spend ap-
proximately 33 million dollars
over the next fifteen years to
upgrade its existing student
housing.

The BS-page report by the
Belmont, Mass, planning and
design consultant firm took three
months to complete and cost the
College $16,000. Dean Waldo
Walker said that he is “very
satisfied” with the report and its
recommendations. President A.
Richard Turner thinks that the
report is “pretty good” and would
like to see many of the proposals it
makes implemented.

Though the Dober report is the
final report of the firm, it is only a
basis for further study about
possible dorm improvements.
Throughout the spring the study
will serve as a basis for fin-campus
review and discussion. It is hoped
that concrete proposals about
renovations can be presented to the
trustees in June

The trustees will also receive at
this time proposals pertaining to
other facets of Grinnell. Then. over
the summer and into the fail, they
will determine which proposals
will receive priority. It will not be
known until the fall how much
money will be alloted to dorm
improvemenm, or what exactly
those improvements will be

The proposed 3.9 million dollar
improvement package contains:

7a 2,1 million dollar overhaul of
existing plumbing, electrical, and
heating systems, which Dober and
Associates feel are substandard in
most dormitory buildings The
study notes that the high mineral
content of Grinnell’s water has
aggravated the existing problem of
an outdated and overworked
plumbing system,

—an approximately one million
dollar program to improve and
upgrade student rooms, dormitory
roofs, slairweiis, social and study
space, and insulation, im»
provements which Dober and
Associates feel are “highly

desireable in order to maintain
environmentally suitable, socially
desirable, aesthetically pleasing
Campus housing stock."

fan $300,000 ”interior
rehabilitation” for Mears, in-
cluding extensive reorganization of
the first floor to allow emergency
tire egress and to improve cir-
culation. This iinai proposal
“represents Dober and Associates'
iudgment that Mears can be

renovated and continued in use as
a residential hall through
measures short of total restoration
and at a cost somewhat less than
equivalent new construction.”
Richard P. Dober will give a
presentation of the report to the
campus community on Friday,
February 4. at 4:00 pm. in
Younker Lounge. He will present
the same information the following
day to the trustees, s
