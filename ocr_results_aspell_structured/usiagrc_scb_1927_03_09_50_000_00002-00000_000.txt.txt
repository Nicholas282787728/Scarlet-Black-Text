FACE THE FACTS.

What is Grinnell’s standing as a member oi the
Missouri Valley cnnferencﬂ None of the interrogation-
points which [ace this college is more.important than
that. And of all the factors in the changing life of Grin-
nell which need be settled once for all, this deserves {ii-st
consideration.

When Grinnell entered the Missouri Valley loop eight
Years agol the other collages of the country immediately
joined the tribe ()1 mythical Missourians — they hitd to be
shown that a liberal arts college could con ete satisfac»
torily in a conference designed for univers ies. No other

all institution had ever taken such an audacious step.
G unell has the “nine distinction of being the uni
liberal arts college in America which ranhs as a univ
sity for athletic purposes.

Navel‘thelessr the question is ,still as much alive as
ever. Gi-iriueii has never gotten beyond the probctionary
stage as 3, Valley member. only a year ago, a Kansas City
editor received wide publicity for his statement_ that
Grimiell must soon step back into her own class and
forget the golden dreams of 1915. Later. at the very time

, when Hyland's Pioneers were gaining nationwide recogni—
Lion an the football field, Nebraska contemplated the for—
mation of a. new grnup, which would have excluded Gr'l-
men. The insecurity at Gill-mall's position has been tier
monstrated more than once.

The principal reason is financial coaches' salaries
are lower here, crowds smaller, facilities less adequate.
and the general resuurces uf the college fewer, than are
those of any other school in the Valley. Illadﬂluitte ﬁ»
nances prevent us from participating at all in several
important sports, such as wrestling and baseball. Teams
taking trips must travel with a minimum of expense, and
for that reason sometimes enter a. contest llhysicitlly

to what the Class of 1927 should do with its bulging harm
account. The prize is hereby- ni irded to the Scarlet and
Itlnch tor the following proposal.

Let the deugiity seniors coiitiibutc their ten' or
twelve thousand dollars to begin a building iund for the
projected field house. Such a gift would indicate to the
rrlends oi Grlilnell all orer the country how badly we
are in need or better athletic lacilities, not only for the
vars _ teams, but equally as much (or the ex niding
liuramurnl program. The administration, in its cani-
pulgn for funds, could make telling use of this contribu-
Lion when asking for outside donations to the same
cause, Finally, the action of the present seniors would
insi ire succeeding classes to follmv their example, with
the result that a tow years would see the accumulation
of a substantial building fund independent or other sills.

‘ liOliiz'TIliN .l WORD. ,
Cooperation and lellm hip are words \lhich bulk
large in the Grinnell vocabulary. (Iel'tnillly. ii there was
ever it group of people‘ gathered together under ideal con-
ditions for the most harmonious and eiiective c'oninion
life, we at Grinnell are that group. The housing system,-
hacked by a tradition of demucrary and selfrgovel'nmellt
winch is eighty years old, make this college peculiarly
fitted to realize in practice that age-old dream of an
eiu'tllly utopia.

Occasionally a jarring note disturbs the rhythm o[.
this miniature world, and there are, uniortunutely, a [eu-
discoids or long standing duration. Perhaps the most
gluiing oi these is the lack of consideration with whieh
We [lent the lihlftly. ‘ [

Gl'innell has the largest library possessed by any
liberal arts college in the wes affording the students
here unusual opportunities for study mid reading. in
addition to that advantage we have the privilege of brows-
ing about in the stack rooms at will, without limitation
or annoyance. This procedure stands in marked con»
trast to that of many schools. where students are not
allowed direct access to the books which are procured
only irom the li l'ary staff. upon request. Grinnell-d
more liberal system is a distinct compliment to the stll~
dents here.

However. between 350 and «lilo books disappear from
the stack rooms without trace each year. In many cases
they‘ cannot be replaced, and succeeding college generar,
tions are deprived of their use. At the very least these
theits constitute a source of considerable expense to the
college. Doubtless many volumes are lei-nailed through
carelessness or laziness. since it is easier to tuck a book
under one's arm than to sign it out. As a result, the‘
piifered tomes never return to their original lodging
place, all because of the absence of a little thoughtfulness,
