Students to End Apartheid have been
very busy this week in recognition or Na-
tional Anti-Apartheid Day. Friday October
ll. Following up on last year's successful
divestmentcampaign (Grinnell's selective
divestment policy can be seen in Burling),
SEA is now trying to raise money tor the
black South African students‘ scholarship
fund by selling Anti-Apartheid buttons in
the post office all this week.

Anti-Apartheid week activities began
with the building of a mock shanty town in
Central Campus during Parents’
Weekend. complete with real corn meal
and a “blacks only" side and a ”whites on»
Iy" side. The event succeeded in attracting
the attention of quite a few parents. The
shanty town featured enlightening
literature describing the situation in South
Africa, among which was the following
short history' oi Apartheid by tvlenachem
Mendel:

The Alrikaners. who have Controlled
South Alrica's government Since 1943. first
appeared in the nineteenth century as the
English and the Dutch were colonizing the
region. The Afrikaners were originally tor
the most part made up of Dutch Reformed
Church members with a strong Calvinist
background (this church is racially
segregated. comprised M a mother church
for whites and sister churches for other
racial groups). ‘

The secret Afrikaiier society
"Brotherhood" was founded in 1918, and
was influential in the formation of the Na
tional Party later on. The members ot
Brotherhood claimed that they had been
appointed by God as the dominant lorce in
South Africa; their role. they said, was to
create a separate nation based on Western

Christian Civilization. and to act as guarr
dians ior the other South Africans, They
stated their policy as iollows

"The Desired Practical Configuration
Aimed at for Whites and Bantu IAfriCan)
is Separate Development in Accordance
with their Respective inherent
Characteristics with a View to Ultimate
and Relatively Complete Separation in all
Spheres ot Contact."

The Airikaners lirst practiced a limited
lorm oi apartheid in the 1920‘s lead by
Brotherhood leader General Hertzog‘s
Coalition Government. which was iormed
by a union with the Labour party in 1924.
One of the Coalition Government's main
concerns was the displacement of white
lab’orers by blacks. who were increasing in
numbers more quickly than the whites.
and flocking to urban centers for jobs. The
number oi urban blacks increased by eight
percent lrom 1921 to 1945 and the number
of urban whites decreased by eight percent
in that period, so white nationalism grew,
along with measures by the white govern
ment to segregate blacks lrom whites‘in an
eltort to maintain a higher standard oi liv-
ing tor . their own kin

Alter World War 11 white nationalism hit
a lever pitch. The white Nationalists
lAirikanersi appealed to the government
with the guardianship ideology. calling lor
the development oi the non-white p0pula~
tion “in accordance with their own in-
herent capabilities and qualities " The
continuing influx oi blacks in urban areas
was a cogent argument among the white
leaders tor more etlective segregation.
Finally. in 1948. the National Party's
"Election Manifesto" was published.
outlining a plan for "Grand Apartheid,”
lheabsolutesegregation of whites and non—

whites. This program won the Nationalist
Party dominance in the House of
Assembly, which it has head to this day.

Following the advent of Grand Aparr
tlieid. racial discrimination grew steadily
worse. In 1950 the National Party Governr
lnent abolished the Colored Advisory
CounCII which had been established in
1943. and in 1956‘tion-whites were replaced
in the iiouse or Assembly by tour whites.
On May 31, 1961, following a plebiscite. the
Republic of South Africa was declared by
the Airikaners. That same year. the
Republic was forced to withdraw from the
Commonwealth due to increasing
criticism and pressure by the new
members from Africa and Asia, because of
its apartheid policy. A Colored Persons'
Representative Council and a South
African Indian Council were both attemp-
ted in 1968, but both were disbanded due to
strong opposition Irom non-whites who ob-
jected to the virtual powerlessness at these
institutions.

In addition to their lack of political
Irecdom. blacks in South Africa have very
limited pcrsonal li‘cedom, They cannot
marry members oi other racial groups, or
even engage in sexual intercourse with
them. Blacks are required to have pass
books at all times. showing where they
may travel and how late they may stay out
at night, Thousands of blacks have been
arrested or killed for not having the proper
pass book. aiid all blacks face regular
humiliation as they can be stopped at ally
time and checked lor pass book's. Strikes
viere only legalized in 1973. and still only
on a limited basis. Blacks aresegregated
on trains. buses. taxis. schools, hospitals,
clubs. posl oitices. benches in public
parks. public rest rooms. elevators. and

other services and institutions This “petty
apartheid." as it is called, has led to
substantially interior services lor blacks,
and a criminally low standard oi living
Nonrwhite opposition to apartheid has
existed in South Airica since the establish-
ment or the African People's Organization
mm; in 1902. in 1905 the APO was we
cessful in persuading the British Parliar
ment to reject a Transvaal Ordinance
which was aimed at disqualifying Airicans
from personal land ownership In 1909 the
APO organized the South Alrican Native
Convention, which sent delegations to
England to protest race discrimination
lagainst Asians and other non-whites. as

well as against blacks) in South Africa,

the Convention was succeeded by the
African National Congress in I912 The
Airican National Congress was lorced
underground by the South African govern
ment in 1560. but it continues tobea powers

Nelson Mandela. leader oi the ANC.

Hivonla Trialon April 20. 1964:

"Above all, we want equal political
rights. because without them our
disabilities will be permanent lknow this
sounds revolutionary to the Whites in this
country, because the majority oi voters

But this fear cannot be allowed to stand

“The most important goal oi a business is to be pro
Iilable,” according to Mr. Lee H. Bloom, retired president
of Unilever United States. Inc. who was on campus this
week as agwilson Lectui er

of Donald L Wilson. class of 1925. The Iectureship brings
to Grinnell speakers who discuss various aspects of
American business

Mr. Bloom spoke on the interdependence oi govcrnmeilt
and bustness as Well as the role of international business
in the new economic order A “study break" was also
held, giving students a chance to question Mr, Bloom on
various topics conccrning business.

In his speech, “The Interdependence of Business and
Government.” Bloom emphasized the need for come
Inunlcation between the business community and the host
governments oi multinational corporations. “It is impor
tant tor business people to understand other cultures.
(Business peoplet shouldn't expect them (people of other
nationsl to act or look like Americans," said Bloom. '

Given Bloom’s emphasis on communication and the
necessity for business people to understand ioreign
cultures. he was asked to comment on the advantage of a
liberal arts education versus a technical education Bloom
said the “general outlook oi a person is morc important
than a technical or liberal arts education." Nonetheless.
he did say a liberal arts Student may have better com-
munication skills than a technically trained student.

The need to educate host‘governments was integral to
Bloom's discussions Education includes working with
host govcrnnicnts on issues such as regulatory policies.
“Regulation is ulnbcrsoinc and if business helps to shape
regilleito policies. il intelligent and workable policies
are mzi . regulation is IL . cumbersome." suitl Bloom.

In Tuesday s presentation Bloom was questioned by
Piolessoi oi Political Science. Robert Grey, concerning
the power oi multinational cc>porations in Third World
countries Bloom responded to Grey‘s question saying
multinationals do not carry excessive weight in develop
ing nations and a company can be asked to leave a nation
at any time if the country leels the company is not
beneficial for the nation

In this second presentation. several tolloivrup questions
were raised on the impetus oi Protessor Grey’s inquiry, In
order to determine if Unilever’s activities in Third World
nations are exploitative. Bloom was asked how much of
Uliilevcr' goods are Consumed by the Third World and
how much. are exported Bloom responded saying
“Unilever hardly ever,,. exports any at its goods.”

Bloom was also asked If another reason multi-nationals
invest in Third World nations is due to the abundance of
poorly educated. cheap labor” Mr Bloom’s response to
the question was that Unilever does not invest in develop
ing nations because oi the abundance oi inexpensive
labor. but because Third World nations "provide new
markets. We’re doing a service to the country because
we’re educating the workers and bringing in managerial
and technical knowledge in many fields."

Mr Bloom also stressed the fact that multinationals
are in developing nations to educate the people. In
economic terms. an educated public is going to demand
higher salaries and good working conditions it education
through the workplace progresses as well as Mr. Bloom
believes, then the existence of multinationals in the Third
World will create at larger market with a greater move-
ment of individu' s demanding more services. However.
.i better educated public will decrcasc the proiit margin oi
