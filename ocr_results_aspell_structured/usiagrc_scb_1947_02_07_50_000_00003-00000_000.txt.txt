Ren’r Aparfmen’rs
To Veierans Only

Grinnell's vets can finally come
in out of the cold. The FHA

apartments located next to Darby,

Gym have opened their doors to
nine lucky married couples. and
the moving season is upon us.
Five couples have already taken
up residence in the new units
this week, and four more couples
will move in this week end.
Shown at the right are Mr, and
Mrs, John Becks, and son Michael
Jon, inspecting their new home,
Each apartment contains a living

room. kitchen, two bedrooms, and‘

a bath. There are three apart
merits to a unit, and all three
units located next to Darby Gym
are now completed.

The apartments are furnished
with Magic Chef four- burner gas
stoves, gas water heaters, ice
boxes, and oil burners. Veterans
may make private arrangements
for the rest of the furniture or
may rent furniture from the col»
‘lege. A rental plan has been set
up which will make it possible
for the veterans to rent the fur-
iiture at threé cents on the dol-
lar, For example, a davenport
costing 390 would rent for $2.70
-t that rate.

Rent for the apartments will
be figured at 22% of the net in-
come of the family. With a mini-
mum of $20 a month and
a maximum of $35 for a one-bed-
room apartment, or $40 for a two—
bedroom apartment.

The first three FHA units on
the south side of Seventh Ave.,

- behind the Women's Gym, will be

. available for single men within
the next few weeks, and will
house 43 men. Those students now
. living in Darby and the Cyclone
cellar will be shifted to this space.
These units are made up of four
apartments per unit, and each
unit consists of a living roo'm,

, kitchen. bedroom. and bath.,Four
men will share each apartment
but will eat their meals ‘in Cowles.
i The remaining five units also
contain four apartments apiece.
and will house 20 married vet-
erans without children. These
units are expected to be com-
pleted at the rate of one a week.
and should all be finished by
April
