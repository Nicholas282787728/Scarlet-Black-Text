Students unite for Coming Out Day project

Tlrercs a simple explanation for the giant rolls otcioth and pictures on the wall ofthe crrllc
today: its all about love

In the aftermath oflast semester's homophobic mailings,snidents responded by placing posts
ers and flrers all over carnprrs as a sign ofstrcngth and strpport for those who had been affected.
Jakob Gowell '11 knew that FM would evcnnrally remove the responses, so he decided to pho-
tograph student responses to the letters for his own use.

Gowcll's eventual dissatis on with simply keeping the photos for hrrnselfstartetl the chain
ofevents that would lead to the tallation. “I wanted to see ifl eould get support for a larger
scale project,” said Gowcll.

He contacted Elena BCIDAI and infomicd her that ht: hiitl photos of ﬂiers and posters that
could be used to develop a project. Bernal then contacted Tilly Woodwardctrrator ofAcademic
and Public Outreach, and Jose segebre '09, who has a strong background in community art, to
develop ideas about possible projects,

The project eventually crystallized as [Lochesponds]. It first involved the help often stu-
dents wlio created ten original interpretations ofGowcLl's images by altering them through Pho—
toslrop,The images were ironed onto white fabric by many other students wlro volunteered for
the project, and that fabric, 20 feet long by 15 feet high, now covers the wall of the Grill,

Woodward believes that the project mapped different responses and allowed members of
the campus community to get involved in the creation of new ones. “There was the response
that came from the community and there was Jacob's response,"slre said. “Ifone person stands
up it creates a chain ofresponses.That’s what this project does visually. lt invites each person to
respond and interpret images,"saidWoodwiIrd,

Segebre added that the project is important for uniting the campus community and
allowing students to respond individually through different interpretations. “It’s about people
coming together and making something together," chcbrc said. “This project supersedes the
hate crime. This should be a testament of the power of community and is not Liust] a reaction
but a thouglrtsout response."

The interpretations allowed students different forms of expressions that would be difficult
to communicate through language. “It provides a different perspective that perhaps can't be ex-
plained through words or language but only through visual objects," said Segebre.

Woodward thinks that this is only the first stage of the project due to the great potential
the project has in incorporating other social issues and diverse snadent participationt "It's the

firstwave or the project, so ifstudents have different ideas we Ll sec whctc it goes, Woodward
said.

Whatever future paths the photos take, Gowell believes the students who created the posta
ers should be recognized. “My personal beliefis that real credit is for those who made the post-
ers and put them up the people who took time when it was still a big issue on campus and
prrt themselves out there are the people who made a big difference."

That difference can now be seen in the one of the most important installations to hit cams
pus in a long time.

Community art transcends artlstic boundaries

Lately,l feel like I’ve been doing nothing but sending mass
emails. Seriously. Mine is becoming one of those server names
that incites groans of annoyance and a chorus of“what ﬂows?"
from its many, many recipients.

I think I realized that I was going too far after I “replied
all” to a party esmail list full ofpeople whom I have never met
before I remember the exact moment very clearly. I was sitting
in my living room, mouse waverrng ,lingering a moment over
the blue send button. Shrugging, I brought my finger down
on the mouse and with a click-click the
deed was done.

Why the equalling frenzy>Whence ,
the uncharacteristically reckless “reply ,
all” mentality?

Two Words: community art.

Allow me to elaborate. Last semester, following the mail-
room harc crimchakob ‘30ch ‘11 rook pictures onSO ofthc
HaterFrCC Grinncll posters that covered our academic buiIds
ings, dormitories and dining areas.

He did this, he told the in a bricfinrcrvicw last Saturday. bet
cause he wanted to create a visual record ofthc massive reaction

in support oftlrc queer communityiThis semester, he brought
the images to Elena Bernal and Tilly Woodward, so that they
could somehow be shared with the Grinnell community.

Since Jakob took them, the images have undergone many
changes or interpretations, as Tilly calls them (see accompas
nying article to read about the process).

I have had the privilege of working with Tilly for the past
few weeks, mostly trying to fmd people interested in working
on the project and get them all in one place long enough in
order to organize this effort.

This last part is where my excessive es
mailing comes into play. I've been trying to
spread the word about the project and get
more people to come and spare an hour of
their time in order to a) help us complete
the project in tirnc for coming Out Da . and b) be a part of
what is shaping up to he a beautiful, beautiful thing.

It has been a challenge to find people wirh the time, en-
crgy and interest at different stages of the project. However,
the people that do show up, or stop to help as they pass the
ironing irr Bucksbaurn's rotunda seem to walk away with the

 

same, glowing feeling of having been exposed to others’ art-
work, cares and sensibilities.

The [LoveRespondsJ project, as we've come to call it, is a
very intricate and intimate thing to be a part of.

For me, this whole project has awakened new insights into
viewing and creating art. Not in my own art per 5:, but rather in
the value of many hands working together to create something
that one person alone could not.

Art is so often thought of as a solitary activity And, while
it can be, [LoveResponds] and other projects like it present “5
with a new kind ofartisr,Thc artist becomes in fact many peas
pic who affect the 1nd rctic ofthe final product along the way.

This is a many- -lavered project and one very close to my
heart, hence my forwaidness (pun intended) when it came to e-
mailing people about getting involved. The parallel processes of
our communitys response to the hate crimes last semester and
cre1trno this art project make. ncrediblycornpe lling, both as a
piece ofart and as an exercise in community strength

And if making this project coure to fruit means heckling
friends and sending a few extra ermails, I'm more than willing
to do it.

In your memoir Trrrrrt‘rrgjapanereeMemzirs rife Sunni, you discuss how when .
you won the U.S./Japan Creative Artist Exchange Fellowship to go Japan you
didn't feel like “an ardent pilgrim" but “more like a contestant on a quiz show _, ‘
who ﬁnds himselfwinning a trip." After your experience in Japan, do you feel as
if you have a closer connection to your ancestry?

One of the things it did was help me understand who my grandparents were.

And through that it helped me to understand who my parents were because I had
been exposed to and really understood the thoroughly American side of my parents.
But the side that had been raised by parents who were Japanese was something that
I don’t think I quite understood or had a feel for.
I think by the end ofthe year I also realized that I was thoroughly American...
ButI think there are certain people, Japanese American and otherwise, who travel
to Japan and at a certain point realize,“l like this place so much that I want to spend four or ﬁve
years there."1 had American friends who had done that.

I think I felt ultimately that I would feel too constrained by the social codes of Japanese cul-
rure,Thc Japanese language and culture both stress indirection and tend to want to avoid direct
conﬂict. And, I think the part of me that is American is the part that believes in speaking out.I
think the part ofmc that may be Japanese or Scandinavian is I don't so much like direct confront
tation in my personal life. But in my public life as a writer, that's something] thrive on.

Fain/7m Suitirh's qfthejnpmlrrz Empire is your debut novel. What is it about?

It's about a family whose father is a “no-no boy". During WWII, Japanese Americans were
given this loyalty oath in the internment camps. They were asked two crucial questions. One
was, “Do you forswear allegiance to the Emperor and swear allegiance to the United States?"
And two was, “Will you serve in the armed forces?" Now, there were some men who answcrcd
no-no as a form of protest against the internment camps After the war, these men were often
considered pariahs or blaek sheep in the Japanese—American community, and the heroes were

the men who fought,..many of them in the 442nd, which was the most decorated
unit in Europe.

The protagonist, Ben Ohara, doesn't know what his farhcr has done during the
war, doesn’t know that his father‘s a no-no boy. He grows up idoliz‘mg his uncle Al-
bert, who fought in the 44an. And so, the book is about his struggle to understand
who his father was, who his mother was in light of their experience at the camps
and what his father had done. . ., anaur Suizide: gfrhﬂzpmizxz Empire is a title ofa

‘ book Bcn’s working on. Hz's a historian who never finished his Ph.D. thesis about
famous suicides of the Japanese empire. And part of the problem,I think, that be-
comes apparent in the book is that the book is really a displacement from the more
painful confrontation with his father's suicide and his brother's disappearance,

Do you feel that Roger Shimomura’s exhibit, “Return of the YcIlow Peril,"

compares with your work.>

I love Roget‘s work and I think it’s terriﬁc. I think it’s very skilled and intelligent artistically.
I think for me, personally, it’s rare that I can walk into an art exhibit and feel like it so closely
mirrors my own sense of the world, my own place in the world, my own experiences, So there’s a
visceral, parsonal reaction I have to Roger's work.
