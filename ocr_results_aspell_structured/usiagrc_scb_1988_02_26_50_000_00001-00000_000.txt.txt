' Buffer-Day Proposal

Faculty Committee Remains Only Obstacle

by Andrew J, Hamilton

on February 17. the Joint Board
oi SGA passed a proposal to in-
stitute a half buffer-day during
linals weeks, The proposal,
developed by the Student Council
on the Curriculum, Calls [or the
elimination of a ﬁnal examination
period on Monday atternoon.
which would Create hall a buffer
day to be used tor study.

Having passed the proposal.
Joint Board has subsequently
presented the proposal to the
Faculty Committee on Academic
Standing for their approval. SGA
Vice President All Elsaﬂar ex-
pects a final vote irom the taculty
in late April. “My tond hope is that
we can get it tthe halt butlerday
proposal) passed this semester."
said Elsaﬂar. The buffer day
would then be eileetive beginning
the spring semester or 1988.

Creators oi the proposal see a
number oi advantages: it
“eliminates the worst finals situar
lion: having two iinals on the very
(irst day of finals week,“ and it
“creates the fewest number of cone
{licb with other areas ol the
academic schedule."

The proposal creators also
recognized some disadvantages: it
”creates a greater potential tor
having two tinals ion the same
day) at a later time in the week."
and it “does not do enough to
satisfy all students.”

The hall butterday proposal
comes in response to long-standing
student complaints oi ﬁnalsrweek
stress. ElSaller pointed out that
many students will see this pres
posal as stopping too short. But

ElSal‘lar supports the proposal tul-
ly. "I think it's the only workable
scheme." he said, explaining that
any proposal would have to be a
compromise. The length oi the
semester cannot be altered {ram 14
weeks. and changing the calendar
will mean starting earlier in the
[all or extending the schedule
closer to Christmas break or
graduation. These are all
unrealistic options which are not
likely to be acceptable to most
sludents and laculty members
Tht-reiore. any changes must be

can do to make ﬁnals

proposal) is a darn

implemented within the existing
Calendar. “The most workable
solution lor finals week is to keep
the week but to change the struc-
ture of the week around.” said
ElSatiar. The halt bullerrday pros
posal does just that and at the
same time eliminates the most
disliked finals schedule, two finals
on Monday.

The other two most reasonable
proposals were to have an open-
Iinals week or to have a dead week
These were rejected because or
doubts that the laculty would find
these palatable, said ElSaffar. The
deadrweek proposal. he explained.

would inlringe upon a prolessor's
ireedom to develop his or her own
schedule. while the open-ilnals
week raised questions or academic
honesty. The staggered exam sec»
tions [or each class would heighten
the possibility oi cheating. said
ElSaIfar. and there would also he a
problem with scheduling. as the
most desirable exam period tor
each class would be overloaded
and students would have to be
moved to the less desirable
periods. thus recreating the
original problem oi schedule
grievances.

The compromise oi the hall
bullerrday proposal is a good one,
said Elsal‘i‘ar. Some students want
several extra butler days while
others call for none whatsoever
lthe "let’s-getritrnver-withvnow
philosophy). The half butler-day
proposal is a compromise between
these two camps. as well as a com-
promise between students and
iaculty. This proposal is the most
reasonable and the most likely to
be passed by the laculty. according
to ElSatiar. “I don‘t think there is
a good reason not to pass it." he
said. ElSallar added that he would
like to go to the faculty with stu-
dent support lor the proposal
behind him. He expressed his
desire that students who are oppos-
ed to the proposal should learn all
the details; “If they look at the
tacts, 1 think they'll see it's about
as tar as we can go," he said.
Elsaflar concluded. “There’s
nothing we can do to make tinals a
good time. ..l think it this halt
butler-day proposal) is a darn good

proposal."

voted to use the Saturday of Re—

was approved by a margin oi 15

Several concerns were raised
concerning the nature of ”Peace

noted that the proposal contains
statements dealing with these
concerns.

Plans tor the event include
perlonuauces by three bands,
probably blues. folk and reg-
gae; o presentation by a national
speaker; and the participation
or college students and residents
from around lows.

Students advocating “Pence

rence with typical Relay activ-
ities. “I think the only big
change is that. Saturday won’t
be beat oriented," said senior
Steve niugtgeu. “But there will
be lots more partying during the
week.“

The Relays Committee is still
open to in put concerning the
