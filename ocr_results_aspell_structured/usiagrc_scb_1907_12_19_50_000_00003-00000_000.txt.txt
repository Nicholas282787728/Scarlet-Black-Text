about one in every live or the regular
Y. w. devotional meetings.

evening or each week. The average
attendance has been about 175 for the
meetings since September 1st 1907.
we have provided posters ior each
meeting and special music oiten.

There seems to be great interest
in the meetings on the part of thehew
girls as well as the old. it is our ear-
nest desire that through these meetings
the girls may be brought into a close
relationship with Christ.

no'ndence with other schools we are
kept iniornied of this work, thus being
enabled to act as teniporar; assi
taants to the other committees.

We assisted the membership com-

This committee as the name indi-

Association. The committee is iiivi»
dad into sub-committees, one or which
takes care or the r. w. C. A. Rooms,
another acting as an employment bu-
reau, ﬁnding work lor all girls so dee
siring. One of the most important
reatui-es ol the work, is that which is
carried on with the llncle Sam Club
House. Girls' Clubs have been organi-
zed which meet every Tuesday and
Summer evening. The object of these
clubs i to make pleasant and attrac-
tire evenings tor the girls and at the
same time to fur isli them with help-
rul ideas. These classes are somewhat
o( a lien enpei-inieiit, but judging rrom
the interest shown we reel that they
will prove helprul mlrl interesting to

the girls attending.
