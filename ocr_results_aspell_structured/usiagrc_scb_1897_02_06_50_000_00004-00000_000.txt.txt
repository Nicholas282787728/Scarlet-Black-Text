hand or arm. Thc inch play bare-
licatlcd, and illicit tilt: ball is in
mirlair they strike it with the
head. Tlicball is large, round,
light, spit and is woudcriully lives
ly. The last game that I wit»
iicsserl was Cltttraclel‘lzcd iii the
Dar/y th‘It/r as the most important
game at tootbaii Cvcr playcd on
Englisl \uil. lthts the last of a
long series to (lccidc the sham
pionship tor the year. or course
the teams were equally balanced.
Each team had up"
game which cnabicd each to score
duringthc ﬁrst few minutes. A
few minutes latcr the winners got
in another SCOIC. then they fell
baclcitilua derensrvc game. Itwas
a hard [ought battle. yet I noticed
no mallllcslatloll of weariness on
the part of any man at any time,
At the close the teams entered
intoa "scrap" to. possession ot
the ball.

A third point i would name in
favor or the game is the interest
to spectators. In each of the two
games there were about 50,000
who could see each individual
play. The playing , individual
and cooperative. lchry time
you touch thc ball you have a
deﬁnite end in view, to keep it
yourselt, to pass it to a triend or
to drive it into the goal. Only
underextremeprovocationisthcre
a violent random kick,

The ten players on each side
are so distributed that they woik
together two by two. One man
has the ball and two others are
trying to get it iiom him. He
rolls the ball along, irccping it all
the time in reach; only when in
especial danger ot losing it docs
he pass it to a tricnd, And there
is always at least one of his own
party whosc duty it is to keep in
a favorable position to icccive the
ball. There is no special advan»
tage in loving near the goal it the
enemy have been duly warned and
are in place. So thc one having
the ball will olteli move toward
the enemy's goal. it in this way
the enemy can be enticed otlt ct
place or on guard, by a ten bril-
liant strokes the ball may be sent
like lightningr from one end of the
ﬁeld to the other. The ﬁrst man
kicks with his foot and sends it to

;t “matlc

 

\llL‘ head Ola iiicntl.’ Tlii end,
who has made a caretui study oi
every phlcllological bump. strikes
it with his head and directs it to
the head of another lrieilcl. He
also "kicks" with ills head and
lands the ball on the giuuntl near
a third lricnd, who is expected to
(lo some lively loot. work and
drive the ball into the net. It is
essential that the two parties have
shirts easily distinguished at a
glance Only thus can the bull
be properly passcd tram trienti to
friend. The team numbers elev-
en, but thcrc is one whose sole
duty it is to guard the goal. He
stands under the bar and watches
the game. He is the out: member
who may use his hanrls. As soon
as the ball passes a line some six
feet in front of the goal he may
rush out, pick it up and lriek it
back into the ﬁeld The goal dcr
fender is he who makes scoring
difﬁcult.

It is a good game for students
in that it is a game of skill rather
than force. It calls in play a
widc range ot musclcs yet brings
no exec "c strain upon any. A
man does his best by controlling
his muscles rather than by driving
them to the limit of endurance.

It is a SEI'lCS of duels between two
harriors watched by nine others
on each side, who are ready cach
instant to retire the contestants.
