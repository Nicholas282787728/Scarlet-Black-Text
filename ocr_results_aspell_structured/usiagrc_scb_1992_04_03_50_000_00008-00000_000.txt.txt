Florida with two Victories

By Steve Johnston

The 1992 Grinnell Pioneer Baser
ballTeam started out the season with
a 22 hour bus ride to Pensacola
Florida. During their week long
hiatus in the tropics thePioneers won
a pair against the Bethany College
Bison.

In their first meeting sophomore
Brendan “The Heat" Mahon started
throwing for the Pioneers. Fueled by
hits from sophomores Najja “Mack
Daddy" Williamson, Justin “What’s
A" Hupfer. and Landon Boyer
“Pretty" the Pioneers scored four
quick runs in the first inning. Mahon
devastated the bafﬂed Bison allow-
ing only 2 hits in the first fourinnings
and suiking out three Bethany play-
ers with his lightening speed and
frightening curve ball. This gave
Mahonenough room to hold Bethany
to just 2 runs in the firsl4 innings.

Mahon began to struggle in the
fifth inning giving up three quick
runs off two Bethany hits. This
brought the score to Grinnell 4 and
Bethany 5. First year Coach Patt
Fosterlooked to the bullpenand called
sophomore hurler Hupfer to the
mound to finish the game. Hupfer
struck out the first batterhe faced but
an error on a tough-tirhandlc curve
ball by sophomore catcher Dave
“Bunt Man" Stewart allowed the bat-
ter to reach ﬁrst base safely. The
next batter hit a routine fly ball to
sophomore centerﬁelder Joel “Jug-

gemaut” Nelson to end the inning.

The Pioneers tied the game when
Nelson reached first base on an error
allowing Williamson to score easily.
Hupfer then took the mound again in

and one error. The Pioneers went
scoreless in the sixth inning leaving
the score at Grinnell 5 and Bethany 7.

Hupfer took the mound in the sev-
enth ready to take the side down one-
two-three. He did just that striking
out the first batter, throwing out the
second batteron a weakly hitball, and
forcing the Utird batter to hunt, mak-
ing it easy for Stewart to throw the
batter out at first.

It was now up to Pioneer hitters to
give Hupfer and Grinnell their first
win of the season. Hupfer began the
inning with a hard~hit double to left-
center bringing up Williamson who
drew a walk. Stewart then singled.
loading the bases and allowing the
next batter, Nelson. to punch a single
through the infield. scoring Hupfer
and Williamson. This tied the score
at 7 a piece. The next batter. Boyer.
walked loading the bases with Nelson
at second and Stewart at third.

After getting the signal from As-
sistant Coach Many Hunsucker, sc~
nior Amos “Ice Cream” Cohen ex-
ecuted a textbook squeeze hunt down
the first base line to score Stewart
with the game winning run. The
Pioneers took the first game. 8 to 7,
giving Hupfer and Grinnell meir first
win of the season and first win ever in

Florida.

Senior co-captain Steve “Fade”
Johnston took the mound in the sec—
ond game of the double header With
confidence and authority. The Pier
neers scored two runs in the first
inning on one Wild pitch and a sacri-
fice fly by Nelson.

Johnston held Bethany scoreless
in the first two innings, but lost his
concentration in the third. giving up
two runs off two hits and three walks.
Bethany failed to score in the fourth
inning. keeping the score tied at 2 a
piece after four complete innings of
play. In the second and fifth innings
Stewart generated two key defensive
plays picking off 2 Bethany runners

turned out to be the rally inning for
the Pioneers. Freshman shortstop

Pioneers took advantage of a strugv
gling Bethany pitcher and scored four
more runs off several wild pitches
and a single by Mahon. After five
complete innings Grinnell was up 7
to 2 over the Bison.

Johnston took the mound in the
sixth and ﬁelded a weak hit by a
Bethany batter and proceeded to run
him out at first base. The left-hander
then proceeded to walk the next bale

team brought back from Florida is
not stunning, Coach Sadewater was
pleased with both offensive and rice

nearly all our games, and we had
some truly impressive rallies." One
of the struggles which the team fre»
, quently experienced was that they
were repeatedly forced to come from
behind. "We showed that we can
score. Wejust need to work on scor»
ing more quickly so we can get out
into a lead.” Grinnell's six official

came together and played well."
