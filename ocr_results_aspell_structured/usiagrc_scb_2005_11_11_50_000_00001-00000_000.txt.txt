For some in Grinnell, local elec-
tions are a fulltday event.

Five women sit at a long table under
the glare of a ﬂuorescent light. They
nibble on string cheese and grapes and
sip at V8. They've been here since 6
a.m. and will leave at 8 pin. They're
happy to be here, doing their part to
administer Grinnell’s 1st Ward muniCe
ipal election in the
gym ofthe Commu-
nity Center.

Seven of nine initiatives passed in this semester’s

day. Less than an hour after polls opened at midnight
on Tuesday morning SGA Adminstrativc Coordinae
tor Megan Goering 08 sent out a campus email state
ing that “Blackboard is currently unavailable due to
some technical issues."

Students were able to vote at around 4:45 am,

dents that polls were available. Voting was extended
from the oiiginal deadline of midnight Tuesday to
noon Wednesday.

The extended hours allowed for 910 students, or
59 percent of enrolled, to vote. The SGA Constitu-
tion requires 50 percent turnout for initiatives to be
able to pass. something that did not happen during
last spring’s initiative election. An initative must also
receive approval from two—thirds of the votes cast.

The controversial Coke initiative failed, receiving
only 55 percent of the vote, The initiative called for a
renewal of the Coke boycott successfully started dur
ing last year's fall elections. The initiative calling for
jukeboxos in dining halls was the only other initiative
voted down, with only 41.4 percent of votes cast in
favor.

more progressive candidate," said Han-

her from going to county meetings.
