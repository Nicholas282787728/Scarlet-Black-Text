with Knox at Galesburg is a
must for Coach John Pfilsch’s
Pioneer team,

Grinnell's chances would be
greatly improved with a win
over Monmouth tomorrow night
~Monmculh being the only
team in the league with a
chance oi catching Coe for the
championship.

Knox has the inside track

game lead on Grinneli and a
slightly better margin over,

, Although Grinnell peat both
lllinois schools handily at Darby,
handing Monmouth one of its
two conierence losses. the Scots
and Siwash are vastly improved,
Monmouth acquired a 6-9 cen-
ter at semesters to make it prob-
ably the best team in the loop
right now.

Grinnell’s \only chance in
these crucial games is to show
an improved eye tor the has.
