Quadrangle Gossip ‘

Valentine day is over.

We have sent

Valentines to our trlends 1'

Anti otherwise, .

Valentines we thought were funny;

Sometimes, even,

Valentines We thought were appro»
printe.

Nor, in many cases did we sign

Our names.

And the parcel post wagon was ﬁlled,
And its quadruple‘d motor power
Was lorced to pull
Boxes oi various shapes and sizes,
Boxes very numerous,
Unto the Quad.
And there arose
Visions of specials when our huzzers
{3:33.

And on that day
was there much candy eaten.
And others said it with llowers.

Didja eve? sit at Table 17 or 19
when you didn’t belong there? Well,
that’s the Way it made us feel, too.
