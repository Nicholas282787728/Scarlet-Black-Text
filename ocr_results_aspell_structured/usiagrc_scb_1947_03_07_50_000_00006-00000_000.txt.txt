Mr. Cruhow devoted his final

dilfcrcnces between the oldl

MARCH 7, I947

League of Nations and the pres-
ent United Nations Organizanon,

In contrast to the "balance at
power” tactics which motivated
the League, he said, there is now
no possibility of a balance or
power. “Great Britain is poin y-
point losing her world position,
and turning it oier to us, out 01
necessity." Thus, he went on,
Russia and the United states are
Ulc only two important powers
in the world

The UNO has no real authority,
he further affirmed, except as it
I], s. and
Russia, “If peace is to be main-
taiiied, it will be done only
through cooperation and compro-
mise between these powers.”

Another great dirrerence, he
added, is the fact that, in spite of
the veto powers which may be
used by any aggressor nation,
members of UN are morally oblig:
ed to positive action, by terms
of the UN Charter. This was not
the case with the League of Na—
lions,

Mr. Cruliow closed the lecture
series repeating the hope mat
Americans will soon be curious
enough about Russla to cultivate

a better understanding between
nations.
