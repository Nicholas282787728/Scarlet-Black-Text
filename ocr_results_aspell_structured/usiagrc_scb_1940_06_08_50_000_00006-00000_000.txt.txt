News of Grass Diet Sends Shudders
Down Back of Crinnell Student Body

By Ken Mathews,

Some little alarm was voiced in
the dormitories some time ago
when the story appeared in the
newspapers about the new “diet
of grass” becoming the latest
thmg for more and better vita-
mins. It seems that man can eat
grass and get more vitamins from
it than all the other plants and
fruits together.

Twelve pounds, dried, of the
stuff that flies from the lawn-
mower contains more vitamins
than 340 pounds of fruits and

vegetables than the average per-I

son eats in a year. This scientific
discovery, along with methods to
make grass pcwdcr palatable in
pancakes, oroaktast foods, hread,
cookies, dcsserts and candy. was
made pnhlic recently hy the (\n‘k
rrican Chemical society.

While no figures are available
as yet concerning the harvest of

Grinnell Scarlet and Black is in
its 72nd year of publication.

the Grinnell college power lawn-
mowers, the thought that 700 peer
pie, more than the combined reslc
dents of the dorms and quad,
could be fed efficiently for nine-
months on a mere three tons of
grass has made many students
hope that the powers that he do
not read the newspapers.

One sophomore student admitted
that he had a dog that ate grass
occassicnally, but the dog, he said,
sccmed to loose vitamins rather
than gain at those times.

Most of those discussing the
“grass dict," however did not
agree with tho cynic ivho main-
tained that gi-ass would he a wel-
comc change in the dorm! break-
