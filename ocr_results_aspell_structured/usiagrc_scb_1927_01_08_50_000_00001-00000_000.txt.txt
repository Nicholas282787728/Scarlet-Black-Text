Hundreds of representatives from
the entire nation were in attendance.
onealourlh being foreign born. The
conference was arranged under the
auspices of the National Council of
Christian associations.

Iiciigious Tollc Dominant

The general theme of the conference
was to discover what resources Jesus
had for life in the world 'todziy .and
now they might he made available in
the present student generation. The
questions which were of primary cons
cern at the conference were those per—
taining to war, race and the economic
situation. Emphasis was on the stu-
dent reaction to these problems.

The Grinnell delegates reported that
the general sentiment was wholly
against war and that the entire con—
ference voted in sympathy with the
American Labor party as a means to
an end. Little attention was given to
campus problems as compared with
former conferences, the emphasis bar
ing rather on the personal relations
ship of the individual to God and pres-
ent social problems. The present
grading system of colleges was scored
as a failure by one of the most out
standing conference speakers.

hell in 1908, was an outstanding

humor Ill Tuition Raise

Is Denial By Authorities

"The report that an increase in
tuition will he made next year is absc-
lutely without foundation," said L. v.
Phelps, business manager of the col-
lege, when questioned this morning as
to the rumor which has been prevalent
that tuition at Grinn‘ell is to he ins
creased next (all, “We have no in»
crease in mind lvhntcvel-:tile results
of our present tuition rate are proving
entirely satisfactory. and Grinnell col-
lege shows the best enrollment record
of any college in the state, as compared
with last year, and regardless of tui-
tion."

It is common knowledge says Mr.

Phelps, that college trillions in this
part of the country have been too low.
and many institutions are operating at
a 1055 so heavy that it cannot be con-
tinued. The rate established at Grin»
hell of 5125 a semester will in all prob-
ability become standard throughout
this part of the country within the next
two or three years. Rates in the cast
are very much higher: board, room,
and tuition are tron: $1,000 to $1100
at the more moderate eastern colleges

and run from there up “as high as you

want to go" said Mr. Phelps.

of a remarkable brand of basketball.
Davis, who acted as captain under the
present system of choosing a captain
before each game, played a hard gums
and scored the most field goals for

’Grlrtnell in spite of having to leave

the game on personal fouls early in
the second half. Fall's guarding was
also a strong factor in the Pioneer
victory, ‘

The scoring began with a free
throw 175' the Aggies but Gl'lnnell soon
gained a small lead which they held
throughout most of the first half.
Collins, giant Aggie pivot man, by vir-
tue of some clever work under the
basket, managed to put his team in
front at the half, 13-17.

At the beginning of the second
period the big center again countered

Lon Bluejays garnered sulficient points
to overcome a Pioneer lead of several
counters, and finish tllc game with a
score or 35 to 31 at Omaha on Decem—
ber 28.
- Grillnell, with practically a new
team on the court, led the Creighton
aggregation for the larger part of‘lhe
game by‘ a margin of five on six
points, and with but twelve minutes to
play was in the lead, 23 to 13. At
this point the loss of Davis, who was
ejected from the fray on personal
fouls, weakened the Pioneer defense to
a great extent, and the insertion of a
number of fresh players to the Blue-
i'uy team, allowed Creighton to total
enough points in the waning minutes
to pull the game out of the fire.

The Pioneer team showed a great
deal of promisé ill this game. Three
players in the starting lineup, Cogge<
shall, Rinefort and Fail, played their
first game of varsity basketball, and
performed very creditahly.

Chase led the Grinnell scoring-with
three field goals and six. foul throws
for a total of twelve points, followed
by Coggesball with three field goals
and four charity tosses. Tho Grin-
nell team showed ilp exceptionally well
in the foul throwing department, suc-
cessfully converting the first fifteen
