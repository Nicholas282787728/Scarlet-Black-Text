Committee OK received s
on interdisciplinary studye

The proposed interdisciplinary
studies program was passed
‘ yesterday after a final evaluation
‘ by the Curriculum Committee. The
program, tunded by a $200,000
grant from the A.W. Mellon
Foundation, now goes to the
faculty for their approval.

Chairman of the Curriculum
Committee Donald Irving ex»
plained that the faculty would be
able to begin discussion on the
proposed program immediately,
but that it was up to President

: Turner to determine when “to put
it on the agenda for a faculty
meeting." He expects that it will go
before the faculty within a couple
0[ Weeks.

There are five branches, or
“concentrations," in the program,
Each concentration would require
a minimum of 30 credits of work

' and would be considered a second

major or “minor.”
The five concentrations and their
Chairmen are as follows:
Eastern European Studies,
Gregory Guroff;
rWestern European Studies.
l

 

Victor Venette;

Latin American Studies, Dennis
Perr ,

-Regional and Community
Studies, Alan Jones;

Environmental Studies, Ben»
jamin Graham.

Several key elements of the
programs were listed in a
memorandum sent to faculty
members by Deans Waldo Walker
and Mary Eysenbach on February
2. The concentrations would in-
clude “a cluster of related cours-
es” and solid student research in a
senior seminar or thesis.” They
would be “diploma’d” (listed on
one’s diploma) but “would not
substitute for substantial work in
one discipline, i.e., the present
major.“

When the proposals for the five
areas of study are brought before
the faculty, it will discuss and then
vote on them. If accepted, the
programs will begin next fall.

Irving Said that he does not
anticipate “lengthy faculty
debate" on the proposed program

 

because all faculty members have
already been invited to discuss
with the Curriculum Committee
any specific problems they saw
with the program. He noted that .
while some professors did contact
the Committee, the response was
not overwhelming.

Before yesterday’s vote Irving
told the 5&3 that he expected the

proposed program to receiv.’

Curriculum Committee approval.

“We’ve had enough time for all
constituencies to be heard from ,"
he explained. “We’ve publicized i
the Sm; and the Campus‘
Memo . . . We've invited comments
and suggestions. which have been
made and considered, I’m hoping
for a speedy dispatch unless there
are Substantive and major
changes, which I don’t foresee. It
is time to make a decision and
move on."

A sixth proposal, for a Computer
Studies concentration, was
suggested by math professor
Henry Walker but has not yet been
fully considered'by the committee.

A‘-
Group studies discrimination

by JanetPope

The Grinnell Human Rights
Commission was formed in 1970 to
investigate charges of
discrimination in Grinnell. Set up
by order of a City Council or
dinance, the Commission has
power to investigate and evaluate
complaints alleging unfair or
discriminatory practices.

The ordinance also gives the
commission power “to investigate
and study the existence, Character,
causes and extent of
discrimination in public ac-
commodations, employment ap-
prenticeship programs, onrtherjob
training programs, vocational
schools, and housing in this city
and to attempt the elimination of
such discrimination by education
and conciliation.”

The Commission, a volunteer
group of seven members, may
investigate discrimination in the
areas of race, creed, color,
national origin, religion, age, sex.
disability or ancestry.

Donald Schild, a member of the
Commission, said that even after a
major publicity push last Sep-
tember. many people do not know
that the Commission exists. Both
_he and Mary Moberg, another
Commission member, noted that it
is unique for a town me size of
Grinnell to have such a com-
mission.

Schild said that from reading
1970 newspaper articles, he thinks
the Commission was set up “to

assure that blacks who ‘were
associated with the college were
not discriminated against.”
However, the Commission has not
dealt with complaints about racial
discrimination very often.

Nina Adams, present chairman
of the Commission, said that most
complaints are about employment
discrimination. Both She and
Schild Stressed that the Coma
mission immediately investigats
all complaints brought to it.

After the Commission or a
subcommittee studies a complaint,
the commission decides whether or
not the complaint reflects a
probably case of discrimination. If
it does. a Commission sub-
committee negotiate: with the
parties involved to work out a
conciliation. The Commission has
no formal legal powers,

“Employers in town don’t take
us lightly," explained Adams, “We
don’t always get the response we
want, but people don't ignore us.“
She explained that the strongest
threat the Commission has is to
Lake its report to the City Council
and then have it printed in the

Adams explained that largely
due to time constraints and lack of
staff. the Commission has not
initiated any investigations.
However, she does believe that
there is discrimination in the
community. “In more than so per
cent of the cases we've decided in
favor of the employer. And yet
there are so many cases out there
we think we would hold up in favor
of the employee, but we haven’t“
received complaints about LhemL‘
In particular, Adams said mat she
thinks there is Sex discrimination
in some companies in town.

Schild said he does not know of s
any complaints filed again’sﬁ
Grinnell College as an employer.
He said there has been at lmst one
complaint filed by college
students.

Moberg commented about the
Commission’s function." My
feeling is, even though we don't
have a Whole lot of power, it is
important to me that people can
take their complaints to a group
that is concerned about human
rights in the community.”
