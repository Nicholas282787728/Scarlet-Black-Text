CAP AND GOWN
- CHANGE RULES

New College Standards Alter En-
trance Requirements.

Because of the change oi standards
in college grades it seemed advisable
that scholarship requirements of Cap
and Gown should be modiﬁed to meet
the nrescnt conditions. The new rul-
ing requires a large number of "A”
and “B" grades with alimited number
or "C's" balanced by an equal number
at “A's", and extra number or “A's"
to balance an accidental ”D" grade.

Personal qualiﬁcations remain as
before. Integrity oz character, helpful
inﬂuence over fellow students, leader-
ship, and service to college.

Cap and Gown is a national hanol‘r

ary society for senior girls.

“A DAUGHTER OF THE SUN“ Is.
OFFERm’G AT THE COLONIAL

“A Daughter 6f the Sun," the offer-
ing at the Colonial Theater on Satur-
day alternoon and evening, January
25, is e'stcry of an Hawaiian Butterfly,
written by Lorin Howard and Ralph
T. Kettering, and under the manage
ment of Ed. W, Rowland. '

The story is a. clever one and deals
with intrigue and adventure, but
throughout the whole play there is a
most delightful love story.

A large band of Hawaiian musicians
is carried anti they render music or
