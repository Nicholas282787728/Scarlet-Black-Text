Netmen Add'Ames
To Victory Scalps

Pioneer Racket Swingers Take Six
Straight Matches Tuesday;
Lose No Sets.

Till-catching weather did not pre-
vent the Anies—Grlnuell tennis inatclie
es from being played Tuesday alter-
uopu, and the Pioneer racket swingers
drove and chopped their way to all
easy victory, winning all six matches
without loss of a set to the Cyclones.

Coggeshall, playing number 1 for
Grinnell won from Shoemaker of
Anles, 6-1, 5:0. The Grinnell ace
kept his opponent running from side
to side, and won most of his points by
easy placements. Pall-ed with Stotts
in the doubles, the state singles cham—
piou again played in nice form, to lead
the Grinnell pair to a 5—2, 6A1 victory
over Evans and Shader of Ames.

Loveioy won from Leermaker, lose
ing but three games, and with Strubie
aided in administering defeat to Shoe—
maker and Leermaker in the doubles
match.

This is the fourth victory for the
Grinnell net team this season. on
Friday the team will journey to 'st.
Louis to meet the powerful Washing-
ton university outfit. Probably the
same men will compose the team,
and from staustics of matches played
by both teams, Grinneil should annex
another win. Sigelloff, Washington
star, will be matched against Cogge-
shall, and fans are looking with inter-
est to this contest, as the result will
establish the status of the Pioneer
sophomore in Valley circles.

Girl F riends= of Scotchmen Must
Sneak Under Tent Flaps Tomorrow

“The baboons cl'y cuts the air,
The band begins to play

The boys around the monkey cage
Had better be kept away.”

Tomorrow is circus day and Grin-
nell faces a crisis. The metropolis
with its over abundance of sophisti-
cated collegiate population which is
secretly pining to thrill again over
another “World’s Greatest Show," and
its dearth of open wideeyod expeC'
taney, which, in the ordinary city
serves as a valid excuse for two dole
lar circus seats, pink lemonade, and
peanutsiwell, us we were about to
say, this city is simply in the soup.

The question is: to be or not to he—
sophlsticated. Whether it is nobler to
sit in the library tomorrow afternoon
and read Browning with your mind on
white‘horses and spangles, or, after
having spent the morning hunting one

of those excuses (which will be {it a
premium tomorrow), to spend your
next. week’s allowance to See the
headless Woman and the Ape»nlan.
Tllc cry of Culture may be very loud
at times hut tomorrow it will gel: 0.
deaf ear. Such excuses as can be
found running about Cooper school
yard on very excited feet will be those
used tomorrow aiternoon~a very new
species of excuse to be sure.

but tor those who are Scotch—well,
every one knows that both sophisticdr
tion and excuses will recede into the
background at the thoughts of the
ticket office, but Scotch curiosity and
the Scotch puerilc impulse are just as
poignant as any other. This is the
reason several men on the campus
have already announced that their
girls will have to scramble around the
tent stakes under the flap Thursday
night.

Pioneer Cinder Artists Pile Up
Points According to Dope
Last saturday.

McKEE WINS FEATURE: RAGE

Beck, Laird, McCully, Rinefort,
Long and Davis Win Firsts
For Grinnell.

In their first dual meet of the sea—
son, Coach Duke-s track proteges ov-
ercame the Iowa State Teacher's col—
lege track team Saturday after-noon by
n. 66 1-2 to 59 1—2 count. The meet was
held in conjunction with the inter
scholastic meet, and was witnessed by
a small audience.

The Pioneer tracksters showed ex»
pcetod strength in most events, will—
ning by a score closely allied with
that credited to them by statisticians
before the meet. A strong south wind
blowing across the track and field
made good marks in most of the
events impossible, but acted with
equal effect on both teams.

irelfce's Time rust

Joe McKee. won the feature race of
the day, the 440 yard dash, in which
event he won, turning in the excel—
lent time of :50.1 seconds. This mark '
is one of the fastest ever to be made
on the Ward field oval, and consider—
ing the weather conditions, is a mark
to be compared favorably with any
record for the distance in the confer—
ence this season. Several watches
caught 'the Pioneer star in 149.!) sec-
onds, and with a favorable day on Sat~
urdey is expected to run a fast race
at Ames.

captain “Moco” Rinefort won his
specialties, the shot and the discus.
in the discus the Pioneer captain toss-
ed the platter 131 feet 5 inches, to
win over his team—mate, Davis, by
nine feet. Meeter, Grinneil, was ex-
pected to place well, but fouled on his
best attempts, and did not reach the
finals. In the shot Pederson, Teal-hr
er's, won second place from Mceter b‘y
three»quarters of an inch, tossing the
brass pelletvﬂ feet 1 1—2 inches, a new
record for the Cedar Falls school.

Long Takes Hurdles

Long stepped over the high sticks
in :16.4 seconds to win, and was fol—
lowed closely hy ”Sonny” Davis, who
was disqualified by the judges. Davis
traversed most of the flight minus one
shoe, having lost it on the second hur-
dle, He ran second in the Zzﬂrydrd
dash. but was like-Wise disqualified
for being entered illegally. Dav-ls ac—
counted for second place in the discus
with a nice toss of over 129 feet; a
throw which speaks well for next
years weight tossing corps.
