Meals. Mariners,
Anal Morale

Old students are still amazed at the
radical changes which have come to pass
in Cou‘les, Lunches and dinners are infi—
nitely better, dinner manners have great—
ly improved, and a much more healthful
overall attitude prevails.

Tlle Foods depaltment has, evidently,
beell given a much needed alld 1evitalizing:
Shot in tlle alm. Meals have shown un-
precedented imagination The b01ing- old
routine has been broken.

Howevei, bleulifasts still leave a great
deal to be desiled. We are faced with the
same poisonous coffee, the scrambled eggs
are still runny, and the boiled eggs are al-
most raw.

‘ Meals are, however,
about one hundred per
last year.

The mass confusion at lunch has been
gleatly alleviated. Students are happy be-
cause they can once mole alrive at class on
time. Our 11 ell fed professors, unsympa»
tlietic toward tardy students at one o’clock
classes, are happy. The whole situation is
looking 11p.

No longer do dining room officials
snarl at the students and treat them as
tramps who have wandered in begging for
handouts. We are, at long last, viewed in
the proper light as hungry, friendly peo-
ple who are paying a good deal of money
for meals. In fact, quite out of keeping
with dining roolli 1 ctices the past two
years, the head dietician at Cowles was ac-
tually seen pouring a cup of coffee for a
studclltian act which is above and be-

on the whole,
cent better than

With the better food and better att
ttldes, dining room manners have auto-
matically improved. The once prevelant‘
attitudei‘if they‘re going to feed us as if
we’re in the army, we‘ll act as if we’re in
the army”ihas disappeared. Emily Post,
were she to visit Cowles, would be grativ
fled.

We are happy to give credit where
credit is due. Meals are better. Manners
are better. Morale is better. With a little
concentrated effort on the breakfast meal,

eating at Grinnell will be changed from a‘

distasteful but necessary chore to a very

great pleasure.

Letters to The
Editor

Editor Scarlet x: Black

Dear Sir:

As o Cyclone buyer of the past
two seasons, 1 am facing what I
believe to be a common question
this year. Are We, as buyers, to
receive the same type of book that
has come out the last few years?

Photography has been poor,
copy vague; poor year-round cov-
erage has been the style. Isn't it
possible to have o well rounded
l year book that actually covers the
year's actimties with it little more
zest and accuracy?

1 believe that a good many hcsi-
tant students would go all the way
for a. staff that had the yearbook
in mind all year round.

Sincerely,
M. Denny Gains
