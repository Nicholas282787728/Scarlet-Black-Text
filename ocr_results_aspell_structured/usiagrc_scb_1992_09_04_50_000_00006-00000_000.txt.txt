The Music Of What Happens

by Kendra Ford and Bruno
Sanchez

Michael Carey, a New
Jersey transplant, read his po-
etry to a full South Lounge
Wednesday afternoon. Profes-
sorPaulaSmithintroduced him
as a man who can introduce to
the world closest to Grinnell,
theworld of farming Iowa, with
all its beauty and difﬁculties,
She suggested that his poetry
can help us in these difﬁcult
times to restore our“...belief in
the power of words to touch
and transform” And with that,
Professor Smith invited Mr.
Carey to introduce the audi—
ence to the culture of agricul—
ture.

Mr. Carey began his read-
ing with an essay entitled
“Reading and Writing the
Land". His essay is an account
of his transformation from a
man wanting to be a poet to a

man living poetry, by discover-
ing the land and allowing it to
discover him. John Peterson,
in his review of THE NOISE
THE EARTH MAKES, quotes
the poet, “Only he, the neigh7
bors said when they came to
pull him out, could ﬁnd a mud
hole in the middle of a drought
and get stuck in it." At the
reading Mr. Carey joked with
the audience about the piece of
advice he received in his first
months of farmin g, “You don’t
really have to use your blinkers
when you come to the end of a
row, the foxes will not notice. ”
And it is no wonder Mr. Carey
was a bit slow on the uptake
when he started his farm; he
came to Iowa to attend the Iowa
City Writers Workshop but
grafted himself to his wife‘s
ancestral lifestyle.

This background is not
gratuitous: reading the poet’s

works, you ﬁnd out that the
citydweller becoming a hus-
band, a farmer, a poet, a hus—
bandman is the key to his verse,
his own discovery of his fam—
ily, his land, his words, his
manhood He explained that
when he lived “back east” his
poetry was eager, dark, restless
and short; living on the farm
has lengthened his lines, filled
his work with images and rep-
etitions, thus embodying the
cycles of nature.

Mr. Carey read his trans,
lation of part of an ancient Irish
poem about warriors describ-
ingforeach otherthemostbeau»
tiful sound Their leader, Finn,
depicted the most beautiful
sound as “the music of what
happens”. Mr. Careyisall about
that, his poetry is the music of
what happens, and he seems to
think that is the only poetry
there is.

Winter Ade comes to Grinnell

The Wednesday Performing
Ans Film, Winter Ade, is the
first of two ﬁlms that depict
German women in film and
politics.

Helke Misselwitz’s film
Winter Ade (Goodbye to Win—
ter—Germany, 1988), won the
Silver Dove and International
Film Critics Prize at the 1988
Leipzig Film Festivalt When it
was released in the United
States in 1990, The Village
Voicecalledit“oneoftheyear’s

ten best films”.

The film depicts director
Misselwitz‘s journey throu h
East Germany just proir to t e
events that brou ht down the
Berlin Wall. isitin with
women of all ages an back»
grounds, she probes into their
professional and personal lives,
achieving a degree of trust
which elicits frankness on the

olitical as well as the personal
evel.Theresultisapoeticpor-

trait of the extraordinary lives
of ordinary women caught in a
SCXISI SDCIBly.

Winter Ade will be shown
Wednesday, September 9, at
9:30 pm. in the Harris Center
Cinema. Theﬁlm series is spon-
sored by the Performing Arts
Program, the Noun Program for
Women‘s Studies and the
Rosenfield Program in Public
Affairs,lntemationalRelations
and Human Rights.

in the auto-manufacturing
town of Flint, Michigan,
Moore decided to make this
funny, yet hard-hitting movie
when the General Motors
Corporation shut down
operations in Flint, putting
some 30 000 people out of
work.

Central to the ﬁlm are
Moore‘s attempts to interview
the chairman of GM, Roger
Smith, in hopes of finding out
if Smith really knows what he
has done to the town of Flint.
Unable to secure an appoint-
ment or even an informal
meeting with the unctuous
CEO, Moore provides the
viewer with countless inter-
views of Flint townspeople,
much information about the
demise of Flint following the
plant closings and layoffs, as
well as the deperate attempts
of the toWn’s administrative
ofﬁcials to regenerate indus-
try and interest.

Roger and Me is not
your average sob-story
documentary about homeless
people or the evils of Ameri-
can industryt It deﬁnitely has
a sense of humor (in fact, it is
usually classified as a com-
edy in video stores), includ
ing a hilarious exchange with
the 1988 Miss Michigan, who
Moore interviews after a
parade in Flint. When asked
how she feels about GM
pulling out of Flint, she
replies, among other com‘
ments, “Well, I’m all for
employment”. Moore even
follows up on Miss
Michigan’s performance at
the Miss America pageant
later in the ﬁlm!

But underneath the
comedic overtones, Roger
and Me remains an eloquent
Critique on social problems in
the US. Through masterful
editing, the makers of the

film are constantly juxtapose
ing the opulent lifestyle of the
super-rich Flint residents who
were unaffected by the pull-
out against the misery and
desperation of those whose
lives were ruined. By way of
this format, Moore paints an
excellent picture, whether he
intended to or not, of the
growing gap between social
classes in America.
Sometimes quite
startling are the attitudes of
some of the wealthy Flint
residents, such as a group of
older women who were
interviewed while teeing off
at the country club. When
asked what they thought of
the situation, one retorts that
“The poor just don’t want to
work. You can‘t help them
any more; we have such a
huge welfare system already,
you know". Remember this
woman was speaking in 1988.
Of course as the
director and producer of this
film, Michael Moore had the
ability to portray the people
he interviewed in either a
glowing light or a very
unflattering one. And one
would guess, since he was
making a ﬁlm about the
absolute economic demolition
of his own hometown, that
Moore tended to favor the
displaced factory workers
rather than the “fat cats", a
term employed by one
woman in the film to describe
people like Roger Smith. But
the fact remains that all the
interviews are with real
people with real emotions and
real opinions. Through his
own involvement, Moore
makes a human appeal to the
viewer and illustrates the
reality of such a situation in a
very personal manner. The
film does not fail to make its
point; in fact, some may fell it
makes that point all too clear.
You can see Roger
and Me this Saturday, Sep-
tember 5, at 9:00 pm. in the
North Lounge of the Forum.
