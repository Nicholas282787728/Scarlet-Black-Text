If there was any doubt about
whether Grinnell athletics had any
room for improvement, consider this:
through two meets this year, the
women's cross country team has al-
ready clocked better times than it ever
did lastyear.

Despite a seventh place finish at
Saturday’s Alermetiean Invitational.
die meet was a success. The field was
comprised of nationallyrtankcd
te‘ams, making for tough competi»
tion. Nicole Cueno '02 led the harri-
ers, ﬁnishing 24th overall with a ﬁve
kilometer time uf19:27, easily beating
the top time from last year.

“Lastyeat no one broke 20:00 and
already Nicole has done that this sea»
son,” said Coach Evelyn Freeman

cueno was joined in the scoring
unit by Allison Nair ’02 (20.00),
Katie Converse ‘01 (20:13), Katie
Groatk '03 (21:00) and Ann Yeager
’01 (21:23), Several Pioneers posted
personal records as well,

“I was very happy with the times
on saturday, especially considering
that we were coming off ofour first
two weeks ofhard training," said co
captain converse. “The competition
was higher than what we will see
within the conference, [so] our times
would be very competitive in our con»
ference,"

Luther hosted the 28th annual
meet on a new course. “The course
was fairly flat, but the times are fast
even for a fast course,” said Converse.

Another factor contributing to the
harriers’ fast rirnes is a strenuous train-
ing regimen that has carried over from
last year's track season and through»
out the summer]

“I diinkalotofthe rrainingwe did
last year is starting to pay off more
this season," explained Nair. “In ad-
dition, the team has been running
excellent workouts and we have been
focusing on being more successful and
competitive."

Gtinncll’s success this year will
largely be dependent on a deep team.
With many runners challenging to
break into the scoring group, the Pie-
neers will be able to run their meets
in packs.

“We have been trying to pack toe
gether more in races so that we can
push each other along," explained
Nair. ”Having [a team onSl Stand»
ing on the starting line trained and
ready to go is a conﬁdence booster
for the race,"

This Saturday the pioneers will celt
ebrate 25 years of women's cross
country at the annual Les Duke Invi»
rational hosted by Grinnell. “We are
excited for our only home rncet ofthe
year," said Freeman. “The women are
coming along well, with many run-
ning times close to their season bases
from last year.”

The meet will be held at the Oak-
land Acres GoIFCoutsc at 10 am. this
weekend. To make things even more
interesting, women's cross country
alums hope to ﬁeld a team for the
meet as a cclcbtation of the quarter
century anniversary.

The competition should be tough
for this meet as well, with many top
teams from around the country trav-
cling to Grinnell for this premier
event.

The meet should serve as another
chance for the Pioneers to make somc
headway in their quest rot another
conference title.

"I am anxious to see how Far this
team can go," said Freeman.

games by the ioorhallesge scores of

springer Field on Saturday to take on
the Pioneers. Despite a scoreless first
twenty minutes, Grinnell clearly cont
trolled the pace and ﬂow orthe game
in what eventually turned into an of-
fensive explosion. After a number of
empty-handed scoring chanees, Amy
Walters ’01 broke through for the ﬁrst
score ofthc day at 21:22 as she deftly
headed in a corner kick. Just a mere
thirty-two seconds later, Lisa Grimm
'02 knocked in a goal on a beautiful
feed from Molly stenberg ’00. That
would ﬁnish the scoring for the half,
as Grinnell could not capitalize on
shots that missed wide or high. The

defensive unit was not challenged
much in thelrﬂ-llrd ofrht field; how»
ever, Coach i-lcarlier penning was
pleased with their play “We knew
