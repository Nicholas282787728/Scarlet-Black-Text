Residence decadence

Lastweek, the New Residence Hall Planning Committee accepted
recommendations by the trustees to alter the architectural design of the
proposed new dorm, as well as thebuilding’s size and cost. Not only did
the committee vote to decrease the amount of external glass on the
building, italso voted to move it closer to Eighth Avenue in order to avoid
iniinging _upon open space. These recommendations are reasonable
because ofbudget constraints, and since inevttabie delays will result, it is
now possible to question whether a new dorm is necessary.

The primary reason for the addition of a new dorm is student over-
crowding. However, student overcrowding is not grossly evident; in fact,
according to a resident adviser present at last weekend's room draw. at
least ten rooms were not drawn. Although this situation can vary from

yearlo year depending on the num-
STAE E

ber of incoming students, there are
E D ITO RIAL

cheaper, less obstrusive altema-
tives: pit lounge conversion, the
purchase of additional offvcampus
collegeeowned housing and the re-
lease ofmore sophomores to off-campus housing. Furthermore, Dean of
Student Affairs Tom Crady said that the number of students who have
applied for off-campus housing next year conimues to increase.

These options also eliminate the secondary effects of an additional
dorm, such as the obstruction of South Campus; although the plans
attempt to alleviate this infringement upon the space outside of Loose
Hall, the construction of a dorm anywhere in that area will close off South
Campus completely, regardless of its protrusion into South Campus.
Finally. the construction of a new dorm under the recent budget con
straints lessens the significance of other financial priorities and conside
erations, such as a new fine arts building or additional fac ulty.

A new donn is an admirable suggestion, but it may not be ﬁnancially
sound or necessary. The delay may be a blessing in disguise.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

The Closing of the
Grinnell mind

To the editor,

I’ve been at Grinnell for four
years, and I would like to address
the activities of some minority
groups on campus. I like the Gun
nell campus because of its diverse
studentbody, opinions, and ideas. I
enjoy interacting with people of
these various groups, but frankly I
am tired of being browbeaten by
people trying to “convert me to
theircause.”If'ind thatmanypeople
at Grinnell refrain from speaking
out against any controversial min
nority group’s activities out of [ear
of being labeled “-ic" or “-ist." I
could list a number of group ac
tions. articles, and signs whose
overbearing and intrusive manner
are offensive and wrong. in my
opinion.

Maybe these groups are afraid
people will ignore them. “Clearly
they should try to offend as many
people as possible to get the much

nmdod attention!" I disagree with
this. There are other ways. Admit-
tedly there are people who aptly [it
the description of ”homophobic,"
“racist," “sexist," etc., but there are
also people whose difficulty lies
not in a particular group's foundae
tions/pn‘nctples. but in the instant
blanket labeling of anyone as a
“homophobe” or a “war-monger”
who, for instance, dislikes chalk
signs on building walls.

It is unrealistic for everyone to
agree with everything somebody
says or does, but the probability
that people will listen if you force
your Views down their throats is
negligible. An example of a good
awarenessweekislhisycar’slewish
Culturachck.Alotofthingswent
on, all were invited, but it wasn’t
forced on anyone. Why can’t more
be like this?!

”PC”: A
Two—sided
story

To the editor.

in last week's issue I was para-
phrased and misquoted as saying
that “being PC was ‘just a label for
disregarding someone's views.'"l
don't recall having said that; I am
not sure what it means. I do recall
trying to express that calling some»
body PC as a way of disregarding
their concems is just as much a
form of closed-mtndedness as the
one that exists when “PC people”
attempt to coerce or manipulate
others' views through some sort of
simple-minded peer pressure. Ellen
Goodman pointed out recently in a
column l’cpnnicdln IheDer Married
Register that calling somebody PC
has become more popular then most
of the beliefs that are labeled PC.
Thus, belittling somebody's views
by labeling them “PC" seems to
have gained a sort ofPCeness of its
own.

Student examines harassment policy

To the editor,

Last week's arLicle “Freedom of
speech poses dilemma" unfortu-
nately misrepresented the college’s
harassmentpoltcy. Thearticlesaid,
“Offensive behavior is considered
harassment if there is a proven in-
tent...” However, the Student
Handbook clearly states that any
conduct having "the purpose or
effect or creating an intimidating.
hostile, or offensive environment"
is considered harassment.l (ind this
policy a gross contradtcuon of this
country’s idea—innocent until
proven guilty. Ifsomeone’s actions
had theeffectofoi‘fending me, then
that person is guilty of harassment:
no trial necessary. However, the

harasser still has the opportunity to
prove that it was unintended and to
lighten his/her sentence. Of course.
the policy does haveitsgood points.
If intent cannot be proven, the of
fender cannot be dismissed from
school “unless the person has had
an earlier formal warning.”

with PC-ism sweeping ilie nae
tion, I think it is extremely impor-
tantthatthe campusbeawareofthe
changes that have occurred at
Grinnell over the past few years.
When I was a freshman, Just two
years ago, the harassment policy
took up less than half a page in the
Student Handbook. It was a short
and seemingly simple ban on ra—
cial/ethnic slurs and did not include
a penalty ofdismissal. This year's

harassment policy, ﬁlled with re
striations. is two full pages long.
The newest additions were the
words speech and behavior. The
present policy says, “Harassment
includes behavior, speech. written
or graphic materials ihatdemean or
stereotype individuals in a harmful
way.“ Among other things, this in-
cludes “any ethnic, racial, or relie
grous slurs directed at a studentv
any form of malicious ridicule or
disparagement, and any other vere
bal or physical conduct that de-
meansorhasathreateningeffecton
a student.” Furthermore, penalty

very easy as noted above), may

SGA plans to rewrite Constitution

has created a “Constitutional Cone
vention"and,bytheLimethisarticle

cial session to draft proposed
changes to our illustrious, though
partially flawed, Constitution.
Hopefully, a campus referendum
will be held as soon as Wednesday,
April 27 in the post office. If that
date does not work out, the vote
will be held on Wednesday, May 1.
Copies of the old Constitution will
be placed alongside the proposed
changes, and a rationale for these
changes, on reserve in Burling Li-
brary and the SGA offices, will be
distributed to each senator. Please
