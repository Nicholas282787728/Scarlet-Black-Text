HANDSHAKING

Schopenhauer tells its that the fear of death is
far worse thall dcatll itself. Whether this is always
right probably depends a good bit upoll the type

. of death, but at least the philosopher made a l al
point. Time and again in this world the thing we
fear is insignificant as compared to the fear its If.

One of. tllc most pervasive fears on the G
llcll campus is the fear of handshaking. The faculty
certainly feels it, but probably the students feel
it more—at least many of them do. Now of course
there is some handshaking and there nlwnl will
be, but if the teacher is one who can be fooled into
giving a little better mark in return for some,
proverbial applesauce, he is a poor leather, and
the mark isn’t worth getting, ,

The real detriment is not halltlsllakillg but the
fear of it. One of the greatest advantages of going
to a small college is the pcrsonal contact betwccll
facility alld student. A man’s education may be
doubled or treblcd by a few minutes now and than
with the instructor. Students and faculty together
must build again tllc fellowship and nude 'ltlildl‘l!
which the idle fear of handsllaking has torn down:
and if all isolated student abuses his privilege, who
cares?

SOCIAL REFORM AND MORALS

Ill the last meeting of the Sunday Evening
club, a question of social interest was ra scd: How
can we make a better world? Should we concen-
trate upon individual betterment, so that in time
people will become good, 01', should we strive to
change society, so that the new ellvirolllllellt will
he conducive to bring out the desirable virtues ill
the people, and make lllall happier?

If we think that individual salvation is of
prime importance, then what’s the use of tllc
NRA? Rather, talk nicely to the capitalists and
employers, and encourage them to give up their
greed and exploitation, and become altruistic and
social minded.

And if it's war that we wish abolished, we
shouldn’t concern ourselves with adjusting our.
economic system so that imperialism would become
impossible. Rather, we should asscmblc all impor-
ialists, munition-nlakcrs, and lnilitarists, and preach
to them noon and night about becoming unselfish,
loving humanity, and striving for world peace.

Love and peace were preached by the Hebrew
prophets, by Buddha ill India, by Lao Tzc ill China,
by Zoroaster in Persia, and by Jesus. Buddhists
and Christians have preached world brotherhood
for 2,000 year Yet today mankind is no better
ethically, We believe.

The difficulty is, we cannot lift ourselves by
our bootstraps and become independent of govern-
ment and economics. 0dr environment, for the
most part, determines how we think, how we act,
and our conceptions of right and wrong.

But that does not mean that we should ignore

individual influence. By all means we should teach
to those about us the virtues which we think are
essential for human bcttcrlucnt. At the same, time,
no ought to so shape our environment that it may
be conducive to illculcaiing truly Christian ethics
illto man, and make this earth a better place in
which to llv

HENRY WALLACE
(Coc College Cosmos)

If an Iowa college student were to pick out an Iowa.
men who most accurately symbolizes a successful career‘
from the standpolut of service to fellow Iowans er'id ap-
plication of a well organized intelligence, no better eXr
ample could be found Lllan that of Henry \Nallace, new
secretary of agriculture. An estimate entirely divorced
from the prejudices of partisanship, would place Mr,
Wallace as one who directed a keen intelligence to the
needs or his native state and his efforts to the better
ment of Iowa farmers. '

The new secretary reflects a spirit which is sym-
bolical of the well rounded college education of today.
In the first place he is a, scientist with a penchant for
gathering facts and carrying on longtime analyses. In
both the realms of economics and biology he has in~
spired great confidence in his understanding. In addi-
tion to a rigorous scientific discipline. he has a keen
sense of social justice, It is this fact which has made
him the unfailing friend of the farmer.

Just what the new secretary will do in the next
four years remains to be seen. But to one who feels
skeptical about utilizing his ability in his own native
state, Mr. Wallace's example is an inspiration. Too often
Iowa educators deplore the migration of the brilliant
students to the metropolitan eenters of the East. “Who's
Who in America” shows just such a movement, Mr.
Wallace, however, is a conspicuous example of a native
Iowan, educated in his native state, who has put his
talents to serve in a great way his native community,
which now in a larger field of public service, includes
LIlc whole nation.

A THINKING MAN SEES l NEW ORDER
(Daily Iowan)

To say that the old order of things is on the decline,
and a newer, greater civilization is on the way, is al-
most to express a commonplace. The remark has been
so often heard in these last few trying years that it is
beginning to have all the characteristics of a platitude.

Thus, when a thinking man steps forward with a
new slant, a philosophy on our decadent order which is
the result of many years of study, his words should
command some attention.

When Prof. Edward Steiner of Grinnell told 1,200
persons Sunday evening that the twilight of the capitals
istie industrial giants is drawing near, he was perhaps
expressing a platitude. when he spoke of the sacrifice
of human life and effort. of wealth wrung from the
sweet of poor men, he was perhaps expressing a plati-
tude.

But, when he told his audience that there was cause
for rejoicing in all this, a philosopher was envisioning
a truly significant factor in our "tragic era.”

He was seeing a hundred years and more of in-
justice—of strong men doing hard tasks to enable capi-
talism to force still harder tasks upon them, an endless
chain of injustice, He was seeing miseries born “in the
heat of factory and mill." He was seeing a hundred
million men and women and children dependent on the
whims of a few money-mad “captains of industry."

All this he saw, and more. He Saw an end to this
situatiou~tne paradox of savagery in civilization,

He saw a world forgetting too soon the lessons of

a great. war, with bordering nations in Europe once
again armed against each other.
. And in all this he saw the world approaching a
climatic sort of doorstep which divides the old from
the new. He saw the world passing over this doorstep
into a greater order.

Commuui3m77“greater,” be said, “if it succeeds."
capitalism ?~perhaps‘perhaps a. capitalism based upon
the ruins of the old order, in which men will profit
by the mistakes of the past.

No conunon idle truism here, but a great vision of
a light in the midst of a dark era. If this vision must
be expressed here in terms of platitudes and common-
places, the more pity that. For Professor Steiner is
truly a philosopher seeing a new idea of life.
