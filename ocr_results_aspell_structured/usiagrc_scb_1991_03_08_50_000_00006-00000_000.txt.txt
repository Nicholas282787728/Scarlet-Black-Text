All in good fun?

On March 6th. Grinnell College Computer Services (GCCS) ordered
acollege student to shut down apopularVAX program known as the Poll
of the Day. According to GCCS, the board was shut down because it was
in direct violation of two GCCS policies.

”the first policy in question was section III-B-B. which simply states
that “every user is expected to use the computing facilities in a manner
which does not infringe upon use of those facilities by other people and
which does not waste “soft" or “hard" resources, The second violation
was from section III-B—9, which states that “. . .Message Boards are to be
operated only by recognized college organizations... organizations may
apply to operate a Bulletin or Mes»
sage Board .[but] applicationses to
operate “joke of- the day," “in .
sage of- the day” and related types

STAF F
of Boards will not be granted." E D {T 0 RI AL
WhileGCCS was clearly within

theirn'ghts toshut down the Pollof the Day because of lheirpolicics, there
are two clear problems with their position on the matter.

First, one must ask why GCCS has suddenly decided to enforce thesc
two panicular polices—policies that have not been enforced for tnany
months. Along the same lines, when GCCS did decide to enforce these
policies, itdecided to initially shut down a single program. the Poll of the
Day. rather than to shutdown the many other quote boards and computer
programs that still exist which clearly do not follow these regulations.

The second matter is the wording of the policy. According to the
ambiguous wording in GCCS’ deﬁnition, many programs and amuse-
ments on the VAX such as Dreams. the Phone utility, and the games on
the SUN systems, to name a few. could all be shut down for the same
reason: t ey are programs that can be seen to “infringe upon the use of
[the] fac ties by other people.“

The final question we must askourselves is whothe college computers
are ultimately intended to serve. Obviously, the VAX computers are
shared by administration. faculty and staff, but is it not the students who
are paying over $17,000 a year to finance the college? Yet GCCS
considers our needs below both the administration and faculty. All we ask
for as students from GCCS is to havea working computer system, and an
occasional relief from academic life through the VAX.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

Washburn defends Spectator

To the editor,

Revealingly, Mr. Erler did not
know the real name of the news-
paper he denounced so bitterly in
his letter last week. Erler referred
to has the CamputSpecmtor: since
there is no suchjoumal atGrinnell,
I assume he meant the Grimm]!
Spectator, which I edit. Erler de~
votedthebulkofhislettertoﬂinging
a long list of accusations, scream-
ing that the paper’s writers are
“sexist, racist bigots“ guilty of at—
tacking “everybody on campus who
is not white, Anglo»Szixon, hetero-
sexual, well~shaven, male, ultra-
conservative, American and liter-

te ” First of all, this begs two
questions: Is there anyone on carn-
pus who is not literate'.7 And is Otto
Pohl, one of the Spectatar's senior
editors, well-shaven'.’

Erler‘s charges were serious in-
deed, and though [knew they were
utterly groundless, I expected him

to offersomething that, in his mind
at least. proved them. But Erler
went on to call the Spectator“toilet
paper," “trash,” and full of “ludi-
crous arguments.” Then his letter
ended.

Mr. Erler, youmay disagreethh
the arguments in the Spectator. but
at least it contains arguments. You,
on the other hand, made only reeka
less allegations, shouting “racist!”
and “sexist!“ without offering one
shred of factual proof. Were you
able to you cite onc remark in the
journal that is “racist,” one that is
“sexist," one attack on somebody
who is not “literate"? Allegations
such as yours are usually followed
by a quotation or paraphrase of the
“offensive" material. No, all you
coulddoiscursethenewspapcrand
make stupid jokes about the its
nameﬁthe Camptu Splattcrer, ha
ha ha. In good open-minded fash-
ion. you advocated that it be
“bumod.” reminding me vaguely

of a picture I once saw of Hitler
Youth in 19303 Germany burning
“subversive" literature.

The Grinrtell Spectator was
founded as an intellectual conser-
vativealtemative to the Scarlet and
Black. intended to present sludenm
widtviewpointsandideastheymay
otherwise rarely encounter at this
liberal nirvana. Had you actually
taken the timeto read the articles in
thet'irstissue, you wouldhavefound
that they put forth logical argu-
ments and support them with facts.
Ifyou would like to put forth logi-
cal and constructive criticisms of
the paper, i would be glad to listen
to them. If the fullest display of
your critical ability consists in
making asinine jokes about the
paper’s name, please, tell them to
local kindergartners.

Student suggests smoking
policy, board plan reforms

To the editor,

I would like to raise two issues
to the student body and to the staff
who manage theseissues. Although
both issues come from personal
concerns or experiences, I suspect
that I atn not the only student to
whom these apply.

My freshman and sophomore
yearslwas fortunate enoughtolive
where no one smoked . This year I
am fortunate enough to live on a
floor with oneperson who smokes,
but who is extremely polite about
it. However, some ﬂoors reek of
smoke. and itis attimcs difficultto
convince people in lounges that the
Student Handbook does indeed
state, "Any student smoking in a
common area, if asked to stop
smoking, must either stop or leave
the area." To me it is intolerable
that the place in which I live reeks

of smoke. Why then should I leave
the comfort in my "home" up to
fortune. To mat end, Ipropose that
some floors (or, preferably, whole
dorms that would completely
eliminate the problems of lounges
anddiffusion through the ventilation
systems) be designated as non~
smoking.

Secondly, those of us who live
on campushaveonly two meal plans
from which to choose: 21 meals per
week and 14 meals per week. For
those students who eat lunch and
dinner in thedinin g hallscvery day,
this is not a bad deal. (Full board
worksoutto 58.77 per day, figuring
$982 per semester, where a semcsr
ter is 15 weeks plus a finals' week.)

However, how many of us do
not eat seven lunches and seven
dinners perwt‘ekinthe dining halls?
Ifyou reduce your board plan to 14
meals per week, you save only $60

per semester (on Dining Services‘
assumption that you are skipping
breatdast);dtiseffectively trapsyou
into paying for seven lunches and
seven dinners per week whether
you use them or not.

I am on the 14 meals per week
board plan and eat a “continental"
breakfast and lunch in the dining
hall every day. For this Ipay $8.23
per day. Icould pay the casual rate
at the dining hall for these same
meals. and it would cost me only
$5.50 per day, saving me $306 per
semester. I could buy a box of
cereal and go to town for lunch
every day for less than $8.23. Yet
I am forced to pay $8.23 per day to
Dining Services.

I believe that Dining Services

THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE

Racism: an enduring problem

Although the Brother Zahir
Muham mad controversy has abated
somewhat, I wish to provide adisA
senung opinion about Farrakhan's
Nation of Islam. Because I am a
Jew, I vehemently condemn Ihc
Nation of Islam's blind antir
Semittsm. Furthermore. as a hue
mantlarian, I was particularly ofr
fended by Zahir Muhammad's ale

ice that the Nation of Islam's sole
purpose, unlike the Ku Kluh Klan,
is not In preach hatrctl, but rather to

promote political and economic
sclfrsufficiency among African
American Citizens.

Fan'akhan envisions a separate
nation in which blocks can obtain
adequate education and 1ch with-
out the injustices of tnsittuuonal-

tation. To obtain this suite, blacks

believes that the only way blacks
will achieve true equality is by
separating themselves from the
majority— white society.

As an integrationist, I fervently
denounce Farrakhan's vision of
black separatism. Unfortunately, I
also realize that voluntary segrega-
