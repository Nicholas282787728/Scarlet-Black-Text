Mr. Garg goes to Washington (for Power Shift)

Students travel to DC. to participate in coo-conference and bring the message of carbon reduction to Congress

As Speaker ofthe House Nancy Pelosi (D-Cali.) rose to ad
dress the Crowd of environmental activists in Co: Field House
in college Park, Md,,she was greeted with chants of"We want
more” and “80 by 20$0."The energy at the Power Shift envi-
ronmental conference left Pelosi spocchlcss, We were united,
we were inspired and we
were going to have our
demands bc heard.

Power Shift, a four
day evonr hold in College
Park, Md. and Washing»
ton D.C, was rhc largest snrdcnr confci-cnco on global warmr
ing in this country's history and brought [ogcrhcr ovcr b,000
students from throughout the United States We were there
to make our prcsencc fclr on Capitol Hill and to promote the
“one Sky campaign," which asks for a policy ofs million new
green jobs, 80 pcrcenr rcducnon in carbon emissions by 2050,
and no new coal plants.

The Grinnell delegation left last Friday afternoon and was
joined on the bus by 33 students from Iowa State, University of
Iowa and Maharishi University The personalities varicd widely
from economics majors to transcendental meditators. However,
by the end ofthe bus ridc we all had become fast friends. It was
comforting to know that students from all across Iowa were
united to fight for the same cause.

Upon arrival, we received packers to
choose from hundreds of panels and work-
shops throughout borh Saturday and Sun—
day. we were trained vigorously during the
weekend on how to lobby our cengressperr
sons.

The first panel 1 visited was on the future
ofenergy and i was struck by a speech from
a professor at the University of Minnesota-
Morris. This tiny liberal arts college with a
student population of 1,700, and an endowment of8.7 million
dollars is on track to become 100 percent carbon free by 2010.

It was this type of innovation and drive that was seen
throughout the weekend at all ofthe panelsThe potential imr
pact of6,000 students voluntarily and enthusiastically crammed
into different classrooms on a Saturday afternoon to educate
themselves as much as possible on the issues was both inspiring
and astounding.

Saturday night was the night when the true emotions of

”There l5 one difference between

you and the corporations You

are right and they are wrong!”

the crowd came out. We heard from Pelosi, director ofNative
Movement Evon Peter, Rep. Edward Matkcy, executive dircce
ror ofrhe Ella Baker Center Van Jones, and several boat pocrs
and environmental bandsThe night kicked offwith a bluegrass
band from West Virginia and smoothly transitioned to Corr

across the field house. Markey left the stage ro a standing ovar
tion and cheers,

1 have never seen a crowdjump faster to their feet the sec-
ond that Pclosi was announced. Before she could even speak,
the entire crowd had burst into an “80 by 2050" chant. I had
just witnessed a crowd of 6,500 leave the speaker of the house
uucrly specchlcss,“We need more,”clianted Pelosi after giving
her speech ofsupporr. “We need 80 by 2050."

Jones spokc next, and while most of the people in that
room had never heard of him, by the end ofrhc night he had
more ofan effect on us than any of other speakers ever would.
He began his speech joined by a group ofAfrican-American
youthY all chanting, “Green Jobs NOT jails.” Thousands in-
stantlyjoined the chant. As I looked to my
left, I could see tears falling from the faces
efsovcral students He spoke to us for over
35 minurcs and cveryone in the room was
transfixed, “This is about to emerge," said
Van Jones, “as the most powerful, largest and
fastest growing grassroots movement in [llc
history ofthe country.”

on Monday in Washington D.C., we
walked stoically towards the congressional
hearing on global warming, only to ﬁnd our that we had ﬁlled
up all of the seats. We warched it in congressman Leonard
Boswell's (D—Iowa) office, and saw one of our own Power Shift
participants break out into tears as she spoke about her home-
land. “iusr through my lifetime I have seen so many changes in
our community it just hurts" said Cheryl Loekewood, a native
Alaskan. “it's really scary to lose our tradition, our culture, we
have been living there for thousands ofycars.”

We left Boswell’s office after presenting our vicwpoinrs to

SEPC funding in question

3v Cums NEUBERT

Members of student Educational Policy
Committees (SEPCs) at Grinnell have been
expanding their activities this semester, Srrnine
ing the budgets ofSGA and pushing students
to search for new sources
of funding. “[SEPCs] are a
lot more active now than in
past years,” said SGA Vice
President for Academic Af-
fairs Eric Olson ’08. “They‘re
trying to do a lot more, and
they're racing some limitar
tions.”

Traditionally, $13ch ful-
fill two primary roles for each
academic major and most
concentrations. “They are

 

 

 

the ACE budget.”

Ultimately Olson and the sec would pro»
fer to establish a more stable source offunding
for SEPCS. Earlier this week, Olson submit-
ted a budget for $5,000 from the college’s base

budget to support growing
SEPCS. “This would get the

Over 5,000 strong gathered on the west lawn of Capitol

say that we're not active enough," said Lynn. "1 really believe we
were living up to our predecessors with our determination and
demonstration."

have been funded by the
