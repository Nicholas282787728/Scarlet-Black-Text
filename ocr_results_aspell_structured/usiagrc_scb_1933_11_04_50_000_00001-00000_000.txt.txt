proved first by the Women's Self
Government league and the Council
of House Presidents.

Prudities committee of the Grinnell
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, one of
the two sponsors of the production.

cording to members, that an admlse‘

sion price much lower than that

posed revue, negotiations were still
being made by the Prudities commit-
tee of Sigma Delta Chi to obtain the

made.

The 310 expense money for each
act will be guaranteed to the halls
and cottages by Sigma Delta Chi,
according to King Park, president,‘

council and the two sponsors

Halls to Submit
Probation Plans
Next Thursday

Next Thursday was set as the dead
line for submitting hall probation day
plans. at the meeting of the Council
of Housc Presidents held Thursday
evening. November 24 and 25 have
been designated as “hell" days.

Plans for a hall and cottage vote
to determine whether students would
be willing to risk paying a five dollar
house fee for production of the Pit)»
neer Prudities were also made at the
meeting.

The council's idea was that pay
ment of this extra five dollars would
furnish an ample sum to defray ex»
penses of production, in case the
Prudities failed to make enough to
meet these expenses.

Robinson Shoulherg was commis—
sioned to purchase a new gong for
the men's dining room. Jack Max-
freld and Clarence Williams were ap-
pointed to see Louis V. Phelps, col-
lege treasurer, about the possibility
of purchasing intramural trophies.

(Special to The Scarlel and Blast)

Northfield, Flinn —VVith the Grin-
neu Pioneers holding the edge
throughout the period, Coach L. L.
(Fuzz) \Vatt’s aggregation of scarlet-
cliid football warriors led the Carle-
ton eleven 6 to 0 at the end of the
first half here this afternoon.

FIRST QUARTER

Grinnell jumped to an early lead
in the Carleton-Grime“ game here
after- a sensational 47 yard mm by
liiugery had paved the way for the
score Kingery borke loose midway in
the first quarter and raced to Corle-
ton's 23 yard line before he was
pulled down from behind. A few
plays later, Bradley scored on a 13-
yard run around left end. Rose‘s kick
was blocked.

SECOND QUARTER

Plity throughout the second quan-
ter of the game was very even with
neither- team threatening. Grir‘inell
made a drive down the field early in
the period: but was halted when Mc-
Donald intercepted Ringer "5 pass on
the Carleton 35—yard line. Senior,
flashy Carleton quarter, anode several
long gains but was caught each time
by the Grinnell secondary defense.
Gi-innell apparently is holding its
edge.

After a comparatively light week
of practice, Coach Lester Watt took
a squad of 24 men yesterday after-
noon to Northficld, Minn, where
thcy will play the Carleton college
football team this after-noon.

During the past week Watt sent
his men through only two scrim-
mages with the freshmen, and in
both of these encounters the prep
linemen, especially Berger Graves
and William Boar-rlmnn, were \an
usually successful in breaking
through the varsity line.

Al Rose, who so far this season
has not bccn relied on a great deal
for ball toting, was used on offen»
sive smashes, and showed up so
well that it is probable that he will
be used in the game more as a ball
carrier than as a blocker.

Jim Bradley, who was revealed as
an excellent kicker in the game
against Creighton last week, was
sent through a series of quick-kick
drills, and gcncrally his punts sailed
for forty or more yards, spiralling
perfectly, and his stance for the
quickrkick is considered almost per-
fect He has completely recovered
from the effects of an abscesscd
tooth.

Don Kingery, who was out of the
Creighton game due to an injured
ankle, will probably be in shape for
the game, and all other injured
members of the Squftd have Sllffic
oiently rccupcratod so that they will
be able to play. There is a possibih
ity that Bernard Trumbull will play
a large part of the game at the pivot
position because of good work dis-
played during the week,
