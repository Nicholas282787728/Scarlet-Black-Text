Scots Going Strong
On Winning Spree

Grinnell’s Pioneers, still, full
of spirit and determination de-
spite three Midwest conference
defeats in three weeks, will meet
Monmouth in a loop game to-
morrow afternoon on Ward field.

The fighting Scots from Mon-
mouth, 111 currently own a.
2—0—1 record', having downed Coe-
7.s and North Central 13-0 while
matching Augustana in a score-
less deadlock.

Coach G. T. Robinson's squad,‘
which was beaten by the Pio-
neers last year to a 13.5 tune,
employs a tricky offense work»
ing from a short punt forma—
tion coupled with a strong line
to throw its opponents off bal-,
ance.

Heading the Scots will be

ored Coe, scored the Monmouth
touchdown on a 29-yard run.

cent of the Scots‘ rushing yard-
age and threw four passes good
for 42 more yards.

In the line, tackle Joe Coop—

With a rather sad record oil
no wins against 3 losses and 1
tie, and a composite point tally
of 117 to our 12, the present
Grinnell football season would
have to be considered almost a
total loss except for one thing—
prospects for the 1952 season.

Only eight members o1 this
year’s squad will graduate, and
just five of these can be cone
sidered real front line men Al
Goldfarb, end. offensive tackle
Ed Aduddell. sixty minute man
Stan McClintock. and backs John
Reimers and Wally Baehler will
undeniably be sorely missed.

However, this year’s chief
weakness should‘ be remedied.
That’s backfield inexperience,
and Coach Brown will find all‘
four of his starters returning
next year in Chuck Dunham,
Terry Ellis, John McClintock,
and Don Hager. Altogether, 31
members of this year's squad
will return, and this does not in—
clude a promising freshman
crop. Depth should be plentliul
at ,all positions, not only in
numbers but in strength and ex.
perience.

For the front line, there is
at least one letterman returning
for each position. A rock-hard
line built around guards Wally
Stevens and Ronny Frank will

Pioneer coach Hank Brown
calls the Scots a “hard running,
hard fighting team which is al-
ways hard to stop."

Although the Grinnellians
must be considered the under-
dogs because of their Linenvi-

themselves something to cheer

So, though things could change

when deep in Ripon territory,
Coach Brown expressed his 3137
proval of the way the Pioneers
handled the new offense, but
was once again disappointed in
the defensive work.

The defeat was the Pioneers’
third straight in Midwest con—
ierence play this season. Ripon
is considered the favorite to take
the conference title and they
showed Grinnell why.

Bill Brennan opened the scar
ling with a short plunge in the
first period. in the second per.
iod, passes from Jim Steltcr to
jRalph Martin and Don Forresti
for 10 and 15 yards made it lead.

Ripon added two touchdowns
in the third quarter to end the
scoring. Chuck Schwartz and
Wayne Tinkalla ran l and 24
yards respectively for the scores
