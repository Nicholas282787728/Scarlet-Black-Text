QN alumnus or ioiva College
9v who is now attending a ﬁrst
class professional school in the
cast, was recently told by \hedean
who registered him, that Iowa Col-
lege graduates are unitormly the
best prepared of any candidates
who apply tor admission to his
school. Such a statement as this
and coming from such a source
will surely mean something to
every Grinncll student, It shows
conclusively that we are working
under a tacuity that is second
to none, and that when given a
fair chance our school will do all
iorusthat any institution can hope
to do for its students. But let it
be rem embered that the best
faculty and environment in the
world can not suscain the reputa-
tion that Grinnellhas always borne
unless it be supported by earnest
endeavor on the part of the stu
dents. What the college offers us
is the best at its disposal, What
we owe in return is nothing less
titan the best efforts wc can bring
to bear.
