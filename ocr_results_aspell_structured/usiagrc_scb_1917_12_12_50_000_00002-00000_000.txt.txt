THE QUAD THEATER
From the viewpoint of the specs
tater, at least, the playlets and stunts
given in the theater in the women's
quadrangle in the first year or the
Quad were a great srrccess. Since
that year, however, practically no
use has heen made ot that auditor ,
uni, except as a place tor mass the

lugs.

The playlets were appreciated.

Those taking part enjoyed it.

The proceeds were put to good use.

COLLEGE UNiTl'.

Nothing is more to he disei-ed in 0017
loge lile than unity of interests and
purpose in the student body. nlutual
understanding and good will among
the various groups is the best basis
tor the highest and most loyal type
oi college spirit.

The recently organized college club,
modeled atter the Rotary cluhs. aims
to increase the unity and friendliness
ot Crinnell student liie. It aims to
be a clearing house [or ideas, and a
social organization tor the purpose of
increasing the cooperation among the
several college groups.

No organization could have a highs
er ideal. The permanence‘of such a
chip in Grinncll the will depend upon
the neariiess with which it can ap-
proach that ideal.

One oi the men at Deming writes:
"This is God’s Cm‘lnh‘yino one else
wants it!"

The lxtlincl' will prohdlily trcntl
on his Lllmne when he hclr ~ that the
Iowa high schools are lining a d to
stop teaching the liulgtmgu ol Goethe
and Schiller.

litany individuals are seriously cons
srdering giving hrrt tow Christmas re-
memhranoes this your, and making
those useinl ones. This is a splen
did idea, which I believe would be
worth while to mahe a movement.

Cannot all Crinnellians make it
their standard to give something to
some one “somewhere' in France” or
“Sulncwhei'c in America" where it is
really needed, and to reduce gitts to
relatives and friends to an absolute
minimum? Cannot all of us tollow
the example cl some ol.’ the girls cuts
tages, who are giving up more use-
less presents and adopting a war
orphan for a Year?

There are many things on a Small-
er scale which we, as individuals can
do. Let us ﬁnd the real Christmas
Spirit.
