O The Day After

is not the answer because “someone can
always make a bomb.”

Professor Moyer spoke next and this is
when the real drama began. Moyer, obs
viously emotionally-charged, said the
m0vie_“insults the intelligence of the U.S.
publi ” because it merely appeals to their
emotions and “misdirects them on what
should be done." he said.

He explained that the film “tocused on
the eitecLs of‘nuclear war instead of the
causes — causes being more important."
He said we need to be aware of the “value
and attitudes that would generate this kind
of catastrophy."

The most distressing attitude he sees
prevalent today is the emphasis on
toughness. He said we are concerned about
wmning and we judge our president as if
hewas a quarterback on a iootball team.

This theme was touched upon in the film,
Wall reminded Moyer that in the film, a
few hours after the missiles were dropped
the president of the United States goes on
the air and says, “America has survived
and will not retreat from the principles of
democracy."

From this Wall said he got an idea of
“the empty platitudes of leaders." He said
also that he got a “sense of how the crisis
got out of hand.”

A lively exchange followed this, between
students and professors. In response to
Moyer, Senior Gail Fisher said, “Maybe
we are too rational instead of getting our
emotions up ,. it raised my emotions real-
ly high! “

Senior Anne Bordonaro, agreeing with
Meyer, said her concern is also with at»

titudes, She explained, “dangerous values
exist” evidenced by the fact that the “U.S,
got a big thrill out of the Grenada invasion
— that is frustrating." She added that we
must also be aware that “nuclear war is
just one kind of war."

Sanjay Khanna, a junior, said he thought
that arousing emotions was “a good way to
start” and that without seeing this kind of
movie “people would not face the reality"
of our situation.

Sophomore Robert Quashie agreed with
him, saying, “We should not discount the
emotional element . . most people are not
smart enough to understand anything but
emotions.”

Sophomore Nathan Anderson, speaking
of what should be done, said the nuclear
situation is “very simple now e only the
U.S., the USSR. and a few other coun-
tries have the bomb. . and in twenty years
from now we will have a Khomeni with a
bomb."

He explained that “we must take radical
risks in order to secure a bilateral agree-
ment" and avoid a much more coma
plicated crisis in the future,

Wall agreed, saying George Kennan‘s
proposal mat we pick a number tany
number) of nuclear weapons and then get
rid of them and wait for the Soviets to do
the same seems most logical.

Wall said he believes this would he effec»
tive because the Soviets would not be able
to “resist world opinion," he said.

Mayer replied, “We cannot be only con~
Cerned with the specifics at Hie moment
but underlining damn attitudes. We need
to iocus on arms control, but we can't stop
at that."

C. Edwin Gilmour

The man, the
and the room

by Eric Green

c. Edwin Gilmour began teaching at
Grinnell in 1949, In addition to his
academic pursuits during his long career
as a political science professor. he par-
ticipated actively in politics. Since 1978
Gilmour has been on leave from the Col-
lege and is a visiting professor at the
University of Bombay in india,

Gilmour's major accomplishment at
Grinnell was the institution of the Pro
gram in Practical Political Education
(FPPE) The Program brought prominent
political figures to lecture and meet with
the students of Grinnell, While Gilmour
was director of PPPE, the Program
brought former Presidents Truman and
Eisenhower and Senators Barry
Goldwater and Hubert Humphrey to Grin-
nell. More recently, the PPPE brought
presidential candidate Gary Hart to cam-
pus and is sponsoring the upcoming visit of
Alan cranston, also a presidential hopeful.

Gilmour is still technically on the faculty
of the College and will not retire until 1989,
His departure in 1973 was, however,
recognized as an early retirement. H.
Wayne Moyer, chairman of the Political
Science department, said, “As far as the
department is concerned, he is retired."
Gilmour plans to return to the US in May of
next year to retire permanently.

Gilmour was an observer and active par-
ticipant in politics in the 19505 and '605. He
served in the Iowa State Senate and ran for
Congress as a democrat. He was also a
close advisor to former Iowa Governor
Harold Hughes, Gllmour's most important
post was serving as the first director of
Iowa’s Office of Economic Opportunity,

noted that beiore Gilmour’s active eltorts,
the Democrats in the county were
unorganized and isolated.

During the Nixon years, Gilmour
became disillusioned with American
politics and frustrated with the course at
the local Democratic Party, In 197o71 and
’7445 he received Fullbright iellowships to
teach in india and in 1979 he decided to
stay there ior an extended period.

while in India he has lectured at over 20
universities and has worked [or the us in

lndia, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and
Sri lanka in addition, he has appeared in
a number or indian tilms and also played a
role in the movie “Gandhi "

At the college he is remembered by
Joseph Wall as a professor who added
much to the political life of the campus and
gave Grinnell local and national recogni
tion though the PPPE His legacy now in»

ideas and a moderator would call for a ma-
jority vote of students, not elected hall
presidents as exists under the current con-
stitution. Concerts chair Dan Klatz said
that such a system would be a “gauge of
student apathy.”

“The proposal is not too much different
from the student government between 1968
to 1971, but that system was ineffective,
Our student government is efficient
enough," said Vice-President Hautzinger.

Concerts Chair Dan Klatz said he sees
the need for “real democracy where
apathy would be reflected in the govern
ment, not covered by hall presidents."

Both Scharft and Hautzinger agreed that
a town-meeting system would create a
“tyranny of semi~majority" by having
large groups of students come to meetings
to vote for their own special interests

“We’re a small enough college to have
students articulate their own views. I don't
see a need for parliamentary procedure or
hall presidents." said 5813 Editor Jim
Lyons.

“We [SGA] deserve more of a chance. I
have no idea if it [referendum] could pass,
but I hope it wouldn’t," said Vice-
President Hautzmger. SGA Treasurer
Sckalor said he would be surprised “if
more than onethird of the campus voted
on the referendum.” '

Editor Lyons dismissed the possibility ot
any conflicts of interest or compromise of
objectivity in reporting SGA news.

Lyons said it is “my duty to bring pro»
blems to students in my editorials I don’t
think my position as an editor should
hinder my responsibilities as a person."
Lyons said the 8&3 is being more objec-
tive than ever on SGA stories.

Faculty social house
draws mixed reaction from

Joint Board

by Mr Wolfgang Schumann

The two main items of business tran-
sacted at this week's Joint Board meeting
were Pete Hautzinger’s resolutions con
cerning the new faculty social club and the
proposed SGA constitution referendum.
Neither proposal passed, the iirst having
been voted down and the second
withdrawn by Hautzinger when it became
apparent that Joint Board opinion was
overwhelmingly against it.

Hautzinger, VicerPresident of the SGA,
was opposed to the institution of what the
Scarlet ﬁt Black called “the faculty drink~
ing house” because he felt it would “only
serve to further separate the faculty and
the student body."

The resolution read, in part-

The Joint Board of the 3.6 A, wishes
to express our disappointment of the
proposed faculty social house We
believe that going ahead w the
current plans for a faculty social
house will most certainly have a
detrimental impact on facultyr
student interaction in the future

“I do think it sets an unhealthy prece
dent It just kinda seems selfevident that
this would be detrimental," he said while
presenting his resolution.

Social Coordinator Bethe Keegan
disagreed. she noted that professors, while
welcome to use the Pub, often avoid it
because, in her opinion. “It's not
necessarily conducive to {acuity-iarulty
intervention.” Treasurer Robby Schalor
concurred with Keegan, but for ditterent
reasons. “I don’t know if we should get in
volved in this," he said. “This is Griniiell.
lawn.” and the town is not a place where
iaculty members can go and fraternize.

Other problems that were pointed out
concerning faculty use of the Pub were the
usually loud noise and generally student-
oriented atmosphere. Must Joint Board

members were agreed that the professors,
while welcome to come to the Pub,
understandably didn't, For that reason,
there was enough opposition to the first
resolution that Hautzinger finally said.
“Oh, it's gonna be voted down anyway." It
was voted down by an overwhelming voice
Vote,

Hautzinger also brought iorth a proposal
based on the “resolution" of Jim Lyons
and Fred Klatz before break His proposal
was in the form of a bylaw, which would
have required'that the SGA constitution
withstand a referendum on its own validity
each spring. it provided that, ii a two-
thirds majority fails to support the con-
stitution, the existing government would
be dissolved and a new one formed to take
its place

Ethan Cohen disagreed. "i think if
there's a real interest in it, [the students
interested in changing the governmenti
can get their 15 percent together," referr~
ing to the 15 percent or the student body
needed to force a i-eierendum on any topic.
Theresa Seeberger, representing non-
college-owned housing, also had her
doubts about the bylaw, “I think it's a
bureaucratic waste of time," she said "If
anyone wants anything changed, they
know we're here, every Wednesday at
7:30 "

Some suspicions were mentioned that
Hautzinger was presenting his propsoal
merely to upstage Lyons and Klatz, who
two weeks ago proposed a similar referen-
dum and were prepared, they said, to take
a petition to the student body to get the 15
percent of the signatures they needed
Hautzinger‘s proposal would have re-
quired such a reierendum every year.
“I'm not trying to pull a maneuver on Fred
and Jim, and I strongly resent that im-
plication,” said Hautzinger. He then
withdrew the proposal, seeing that it did
not have enough support to pass.
