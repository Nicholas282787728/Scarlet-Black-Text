Professor Earl S. Srong's Chapel
talk Tuesday consisted OI ml allllliczh

ads, in his address last Friday, Mr
Strong Stated that if the blatant Saw

were false gods. equally false was the
dogmatically materialistic god, Wllo

cs would be burning at the stake and
wc would be riding in okcarts rather
than aeroplanes,

The blatant Savant Mr. Strong
characterized as being sometimes
harmless, occasionally dangerous and
never hciplul, but no is to be piticd
and not condemned. The dead reoc-
tionitry can be dismissed with the ex-
pression “Say it with flowers," for his
is a waning inllucncc. The annual

thy endeavors and nohlc projects. Fl-
nclly, he is an idcnllst, a dreamer“
out a dreamer full of courage, seeking
the goal of truth. The educated man
is a. wishful thinker, but he is wishful
