Grinnellians who need food for
thought in the wee hours of the morn?
ing and those who like to wander around
town at 2 am. will either have to ignore
the hunger pangs or ﬁnd another desti—
nation: the back door at Danish Maid
Bakery is now closed.

The owners of the bakery, Bill and
Suzi Hansen, are short ofhelpr “My hus—
band is the only one here," Ms. Hansen
said, “As soon as he gets someone to help
him, the back door will be open again."

‘ More problem} with hookingih

Human waste is not a pleasant pan or life In
general it isnt a part that most people want to
admit is there—but it is We all poo, crap, sh‘t,
slim, potty, numbor two, drop deuces, etc, but
my question is, where is the etiquette? I live on
Cowles 1 so I am subject to one single communal
bathroom Now, normally this isn’t a fproblem but
lately people have been going out 0 their way to
take the biggest crops in our bathroom! I mean
cornc on, \isitors, and pcoplc who livc in thc
Cowles apartments, if the land is that bad that
you don’t even want to funkify your own place,
why would you subjccr us to the madness? All 1
can cryis next urnc you are on Cowlcs 1 and you
feel that swirling gurgle ofdiarrhea, the lcnst you
could do is get some: air spray.

Conforming tolnonconforr’rlii'y

Being her: at C-rinncli we car a lot of ':
rhetoric about tolerance and respect for others”
points of View More often than not what this
really means is. we are tolerant so long osyo
views conform to our mi-mw deﬁnition of what
it is appropriate to believe in within our narrow
ptogtesswe (which seems to have become
onyurons with enlightened) point ofvim 1 (mi
hardly win: you would consider a conservative,
but tho fact that them oxisn~ not a single organ
nim'ron ofcnrnpus Republicans is horriﬁc.This
lack of diversity in opinion rather than being a
reﬂection of our student body make up is instead
a result affair of the social ostracism that would
result from one being open about their views.
This conforming nonconformist hypocrisy is
disappointing ro suy the least.
