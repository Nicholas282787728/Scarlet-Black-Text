Students attack Washburn's Views on Pride Week

To the editor,

What can you do but admire the
courage and insightorterectby Mikc
Washbum in his luctd, informative
and always wcllrreasoned columns'.7
His writing serves to defend the
pcoplctind lilcals which have made
this country one hell of it place to
be. Washburn knows the score. and,
thttnktully, he's writing to share it
with us.

Last week’s column was a per-
fectcxtlmple. In it, headdressed the
fullacious foundations ofGay/Les
bian Pride Week, astutely stating
thalifhomosexuality is to beyiewed
as natural. then “it follows that ho-
mosexuals should not view their
sexuality as any more a source of
‘pride,‘ as any more a thing to cel-
ebrate, than heterosexuals do." He
observes heterosexualiiy is rarely
celebrated: “there are never hetemr
sexuals marching simply as hetero-
sexuals in the Saint Patrick’s Day
Parade." Washbum thus took an
ever-presentcr‘lsis in American his-
loryithe position of those notquitc
in step with the main of society—
anddistilleditinlo onesimplestate»

menl, We are kindly spared the
trouble of being bogged down in
reality, something all right—think
ens welcome.

Indeed. one only need look at
the main of sarcalled Straightsoclr
ety to see how well heterosexuals
can cope with their sexuality. Ex-
amples are as close its your ncllrest
video store. Closer, even, If you
take advantage of the resources the
People's Republic bt Grinncll has
mtldc tlyulluhle for you. This week-
end, the movies Prelry Woman and
Splash will be shown on campus.
Talk about an opportunity to see a
view of hcteroscxuality unmarrcd
by romanticism or ideology! Nci»
ther film tails prey to the trap which
condemns so many “gay" ttlms;
pride in one’s sexuality plays no
part in these films but is merely the
foundation around which they cxr
ist. They do not celebrate hetero-
sexuality; they only present it in a
wholly favorable and sentimental
light.

In Splash, when John Candy‘s
charactercclebratcs his publication
in Penthouie (another non-gay in-
stitution whose sophistication alr

lows it to eschew the pitfalls of
sexual pride-cum-celebration) by
passing copies out to everyone he
sees. he does not do so because he
is proud or his heterosexuality. He
does so because utescrlptentails he
do so. Close examination of the
chlunctcr reveals heterosexuality
pldysa role in hts lite only insotar
us it defines lilS beingr and not one
iota inorc.

Likewise, Prclry Woman, one
otthebtggcst-gresstngt’tlmsotlust
year, uses heterosexuultty and its
:cclninglyrincumbent values sparr
ingty. lts exploration of malerfe~
male relationships does little more
than assert that such an orientation
is most desirable. These are but a
couple or examples of the restraint
exercised by heterosexuals in ad-
dressing their sexual orientation to
societyratrlarge. The reader can no
doubtthinkofotherexarnpleswhere
one encounters heterosexual atti-
tudcs.

Is it so much to ask that homo-
sexuals. indeed all “minorities,“
follow the same example of re—
straint?

Column neglects heterosexual privileges

To the cditor.

tnresponseto Mike Washburn‘s
column, “0n Pride Week,” in last
week’s Scarlet and Black, I have
two comments. First, I would like
to correct him on a signiﬁcantand
commonly-made error. He leﬁ out
the word bisexual when he men—
tioned “Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual
Pride Week.” I am not quibbling
abouta technicality; I regard this as
a critical issue. Because bisexuals
have often been left out of homo
sexual issues, ourexistence has been
largely ignoredand misunderstood.
By leaving out “bisexual."
Washbum reinforces this birinvis~
ibillty.Irealizethatitisawkward to
continuallyprintthephraselcsbian/
bisexual/guy. Perhaps in tuture arr
ticles he could use the more inclu-
sive and aesthetic tcrm lesbigay
when referring to all homosexuals.

I also dislike hts statement: “If
homosexuality is no more or less
natural than heterosexuallty, it folr
lows that homosexuals should not
View their sexuality as any more a
source ofprlde,as any more a thing
to celehmte, then heterosexuals do.“
Mr. Washbum has misunderstood
the reason for our celebration and
pride. In an ideal world, where all
forms ofsexualities are equally rer
spected. he may be correct. Yet
becauseall things are not equal, we
have a reason to cclcbmte. We are
not celebrating our sexuality, our
differences. as much as the fact that
we've had the courage to acknowl-
edge those (It i fcrcnceth’sno small
accomplishment to say, “I respect
myself' when so much of the world
blatantly tells us that we are abnor-
mal and disgusting. We are cel»

are happy, healthy human beings
despite a world that hates and tears

I hope Mr. Washburn realizes
that we expect no more privilege
than heterosexuals possess. But

The need for equality

To the editor,

Mike Washburn’s Common
Sense column “0n Pride Week"
epitomizes the banal ignorance of
narrow, ahistoncal prosteletyzing.
Washbum. for all his rhetoric on
the use of logic and fact, falls to
take into account crucial ycritics
which completely undercut the al-
ready flimsy foundations of his at»
gumcnt. Washbum does not once
mention the existence of dccpr
rooted biasagainstallminorities in
our society, yet such an acknowl-
edgment is vital to understanding
the reasoning behind Gay/Lesbian/
Bl Pride chk or any other con~
sciousncss-raising ettort. l-tomo.

sexuals and blacks (to name a few)
have been traditionally conceptuale
ized as the “Other,” the dichoto-
mous contradiction of the norm of
the white male heterosexual. Pride
Week is but one way to
roconceptualizeimagesandimpres»
Stons which have their roots in mlSr
understanding and hatred.

Mostot us, to some degree, are
privileged by race, gender,
afl’ccttonal prclcrcncc and/or class
status. and we must recognize that

To the editor,

Before claiming that a group's

haps Mr. Washbum could scruw

an opportunity for bl/gtly/lcsbian
people to publicly celebrate some-
thing Soctcty stigmatizcs: homo»
sexuality. To suggest that this ccl»
cbration is a “Special entitlement"
is as devoid of logic as claiming

"practitioner" of hetemsexualtty, I
feel unmotivated to create a cel-
ebration ofhctcroscxuality, for it is

“slraig Homosexuals encounr
let discrimination. hatred, and bru—
tality that heterosexuals never face.
Sodomy laws target homosexuals
speciﬁcally. To imply that homo-
sexuals enjoy equality with hetero-
sexuals, legally or socially, under-
cuts the logic ML Washburn‘s at»
ticlt: yearns for.

Suggesting that people cannot
both "cxclaim and exalt [their] dif-
ference" and still work for equality
isa rather feeble kneejerk from the
far right. Mr. Washbum‘s column
saysthathomosexuals“demandthar
the military and employers abso-
lutely ignore what makes them d|fe
ferent," and that “celebrations like
‘Pride Week‘” somehow detract
from claims looqltality.Such logic
is indeed “muddled." Homosexur
als demand no more ignorance of
difference than is accorded every-
one. Like heterosexuals, homosexu-
als should not face employment
discrimination based onsexualpref-
erencc. The “equality for every-
body bctorc the law“ that Mr.

Washbum’s column requests does

men, yet they demand equal Lrélatr
ment. Unfortunately, there is not
“equalityforeverybody,”arldl>ride
chk takes action to create it. His
article takes issue with the “Strip
dent” and “Conspicuous" nature of
Pride Week. Even if Prttle Week
were obuusive, Barry Goldwater
reminds us. “Eercmism in the den
fcnsc of liberty is no vicc.”

Mr. Washbum’scolumnclaims
that homosexuality should cause
no more pridethan heterosexuality,
itboth are equally “natural," Why
nature always gets trotted around in
sexualdiscussmnsbythefarrightI
do not understand. His column also
claims there “simply [are] no het-
crosexual equivalents" to Pride
Week. Perhaps Mr. Washbum's
article should specifically claim a
lack of positive heterosexual
equivalents, because negative het-
erosexualequivalentsdoexist.’l'hey
differ from Pride Week in their
purpose: bashing homosexuality,
notcelebtalingheterosexualllyiFor
example, ai the University of Mas
sachusettsatAmherst,thekepubii-
can Club, Young Americans for
Freedom and others recently put
together “Conservative Awareness
Week." At their Second Annual
Suaight Pride Rally, brandishing
semi-symbolicbluesquarosaltend-
ing members were quoted in the
New York Timesassaying, "Keep it
in thecloset" and that homosexuals
“want to force their sexuality on
me" Apparently their heterosexu-
ality was never celebrated The
Time: also reponed death threats
against members of the counter
demonstration. I am sure that Mrt
Washbum would remain true to
principle and write of this event,
whose purpose was notcelebration
but attack, as at least as lamentable
as Pride Week.

Pride Week dares to celebrate
by bringing in speakers, showing
ttlms,educuungcveryone.andsup-
porting bi/gay/lesbittn people who
currently do not enjoy equality.
Pride Week works actively tor the
cquultty Mr. Washbum's article
hold: in such high esteem, and i: a
benefit to all.
