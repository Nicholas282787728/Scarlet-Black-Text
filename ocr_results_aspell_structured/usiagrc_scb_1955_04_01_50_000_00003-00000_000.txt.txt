Track Mainstay Kingland
Looks For Best Season

by Dennis Watson
Jim Kingland, an Iowan from

Lake Mills, came to Grinneu
four years ago and has become
what track team captain Bill
Largent terms, “the greatest
cohesive force on the team."

Jim’s track background,
which began in his home town
where he attended high School,
has advanced at Grinnell-to the
point where he is one of the
top contenders in the Midwest
conference halfamile and a
mainstay on Pioneer relay
teams}

The redJmired econ major
improved rapidly during his
freshman year and moved
into the half—mile during his
sophomore year where he
took a surprise second in the
canierence with a clocking of
1:58. This same year he also
ran as a member of the Pio-
neer mile relay team which
took first in the conference.
Last year he took third in
the conference half-mile and
again ran with the mile-relay
team, this time placing sec-
and.

Jim, incidentally, is a four
year member of the milearelay
team as well as a four year let-

terman. He recently anchored ,

the sprint-medley and mile-re.
lay teams to second place in the
Midwest conference indoor meet
held at Chicago University in
Chicago.

Coach EG. Booth had this to.‘
say about the senior president-

of Gates hall, “I think that this
will be Jim’s big year; in four
years he has never missed a
meet and has always been
ready to go out and do his best.
‘His contributions as
man have tended to over-shadr
ow his individual performances."

Team captain Largent also
feels that this will be Jim’s
best year and added this to
his previous statement, “You
always know that he I‘m the
best race that he could. . . .
his mental attitude is so con.
tagious that the whole team
can't help out henetit from
it."

Squads Open
Againsl‘ Knox

Grinnell‘s golf and tennis
teams swing into action after
the vacation with both squads

opening at Knox April 16 at
Galesburg, Ill.

The golfers, led by returning~
letterwinners Dick von Maur
and Lee Savage, face last years
conference champs in the Si.
washers. The Knoxmen are also
expected to field a top-notch
contingent this season and
should be one of the toughest
teams the linksmen will face
all season.

The racketmen lead Off
against Knox and on the fol»
lowing Wednesday take on Cor-
nell in their first home tilt ot
the season. Neither Knox war the
Rams fared Well in last year’s
competition while the Pioneers
swept to a conference third.

NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE, you‘ll get more pleasure from
your cigarette if it‘s a Lucky Strike. That’s the point of the
Droodle above, titled: Three deep-sea divers enjoying Luckies.
You get deepadown Smoking enjoyment from Luckles because
they taste better. Why do they taste better? That’s easy to
fathom. First of all, Lucky Strike means ﬁne tobacco. Then,
that tobacco is toasted to taste better, “It’s Toasted”—the
famous Lucky Strike process—tones up Luckies’ light, mild,
good-tasting tobacco to make it taste even better , , . cleaner,

better-tasting cigarette . . . Lucky Strike.
