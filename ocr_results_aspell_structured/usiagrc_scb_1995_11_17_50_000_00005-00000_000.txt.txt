Inspired by the mountains of
Colorado, the lakes of Minnesota,
and the rolling hills of Ioiva, Sarah
and Karl DeLong‘s artexhibit at the
Grinnell Community Center is full
of images orthe natural world.

opening this Friday, November
17, the DeLoiig's artwork is based on
the “experiences in the outcrdoors.
Taken from field sketches and pho<
tographs, the watercolors and pen
and ink drawings are realistic, but are
in tact “molded by many scenes and
emotions and rarely depict an actual
place," says Karl DeLDng, a professor
of biology here at ormnell.

The bulk of the exhibit belongs
to Sarah DeLong, a freelance artist
and photographer, who has studied
with Jean Dobie, Irying Shapiro,
Buffalo Kablinski, and Tony Couch.
An art major at the College of St.
Benedict in Minnesota, she began to
“watercolor ineamest in 1988,” while
in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on Sabbatr
ical.

Much of the DeLong’s work was

done in Boulder, Colorado while on
another sabbatical leave during 1993

and i994,and monyofthepaintlngs
depict "the mountains, cabins,
streams and the wmdswept timber—
line scenery ofColorado,” says Karl
DeLong. There are also scenes [Elke
en from ”the remote lakes of the
northern Minnesota canoe coun—
try,"hesays,wl1t:rcl’icli:is“tziughtat
the ACM Wilderness Field Station
there since 1968, and canoed over
1000 miles in the area.” Inter-
spersetl between the portraits of
mountain goats and the snow cov—
ered mountain landscapes, howty.
er, are scenes oflowa forms.

“I try to paint barns that are
going to be demolished due to age
and urban sprawl," says Sarah, and
many of the stnictures depicted in
the exhibit no longer eXist. “I try to
capture them before they go,” she
says

The DeLong’s work has previ—
ously been shown at iuried exhibits,
including the Folk Co, Heritage
Gallery and the Northern Lights
Exhibit in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Their show at the Community Cen—
ter opens on the 17th, with a recap»
tion With the artists at 4:30. The
show will mn until December 8, and
then will move to the Grinnell Re<
gional Medical center.

Grinnellians, by their nature, are
an impatient group. I say this not as a
judgement, but merely as an observzi»
tion. I, too, type my usernarne and
password before the e—mail screen
shows up on the computer, and feel as
though I am wasting time ill wait for
more than 12 seconds while the come
purer processes this information.
Thoughl am well aware orthe money
I am paying to educate myself here, I
often find myself restless if a professor
continues to talk more than a minute
or two past the end of class.

So it comes as a small surprise to
me that there is one thing that people
are willing to wait for: dining hall
food. True, there are those who get
saclt lunches daily in order to award
mile<lorig (and mile-wide) lines, but
sometimes even they get frustrated
and return to the dining halls
(“AUGl-il I asked for apple cinna-
rnon bagels! How canl possibly eat
strawberry yelly on an onion bageln
think I am going to iump off of the top
of Norris now.)

Most of us, however, seem will—
ing to wait inline for the. fare served at
Quad and Cowles. ( In fact, people are
even willing to put their lives on the
line for the privilege of eating in the

renaissance England. The group
works comprehensively at making
their performances authentic, says
professor Elizabeth Hays, the direc»

tor In addition to playing many “1'
struments still common in England
today, the group also plays replica
period instruments such as the crum»
horn (similar to bagpipes), natural
ﬂuie, viol, and shawm (similar to the
oboe). The singer also takes care to
pronounce the Songs' lyrics in the
speech ofthe time they were written,
Hays says,

Hays says that most of the songs
ofrhe period are "soft," being general—
lycomposed forindoorentertainment
like court dances and theatre produc:
tions. But many or these songs were
derived from the oral traditions of the
commonpeople, Haysexploins. “The
concert explores ways in which popur
larsongs and country dances interact<
ed with court and theatre music."

Among the songs planned are
some written by celebrities ofthe day:
Shakespeare wrote the lyrics for one,
and King Henry VIII (whom Hays
describes as a talented lute player in
his spare time) composed the tune for
another. To further evoke the feeling

concert is scheduled for 8 pm. on

came out of a desire from students to
do something as a group,” This
year's nine performers will collabo—
rate to play in tluets, trios, and even
a full ﬂute choir.

Anderson explains that this
kind ofperformance pushes the flute
students to master harder pieces, as
it is less intimidating to perform in a
group. Since the students are less
afraid to take risks, the audience can
look forward to a variety of uncon-
ventional performances, she says.
Anderson says she enjoys experi—
menting with ”fresh“ ideas. For ex—
ample, in earlier Fresh Flutes con—
certs, the students have performed
from unusual positions in Herrick,
such as the corner of the room and
up in the balcony. Anderson be—
lieves that this kind of change gets
the audience's attention and cap-
tures people’s interest.

Anderson says she enjoys the
opportunity to work with a diverse
group of students, as opposed to only
