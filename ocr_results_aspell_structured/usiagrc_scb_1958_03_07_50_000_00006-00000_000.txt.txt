basketball league with a 9d
won-lost record, Close behind in
the second slot is Langan with
7—3, At this point, with the sea-
son three weeks along, it still
looks like a tight race right
down to the wire.

Several teams have lost some
key men with the bcginning of
the indoor track season. Cowles
Seems to be the hardest hit, 1057
ing their No. 1 and 2 scorers
off the “B” team. However,

similar problem.

Grinnell's indoor track team
journeyed to Chicago today to
compete in the eighth annual
University of Chicago invita-
tional Track Meet. The meet,
which includes all the Midwest
Coference learns plus the U.
of Chicago, annually determines
the strongest of the Midwest
Indoor track teams.

Cornell, 1957 indoor and Outs
door titlists, is a unanimous
choice to lead the Conference
teams. Second place seems to
.be a toss up among Carleton,
Grinnell, Lawrence, and Ripon.
Monmouth and St. Olaf should
battle it out for Sixth with Coe
and Knox struggling to escape
the-cellar.

The 1958 Rams have better
balance than the 1957 champs
and figure to be especially strong
in the relays. the law hurdles
and the field Events. Gtinnell
seems weaker on paper than last
year‘s aggregation, which placed
third, but the Pioneers should
score in the relays and lit the
two mile run.

The 195771958 Midwest Con-
ference basketball race ended
in a tripla tie between Carleton,
Coe, and Knox. Needing road
victories over both Cornell and
Coe, Carleton was able to defeat
only the former (80-69). The
Carls’Joss to Coe (83-71) paved
the way for the Kohawks and
the Siwashers to claim a share
of the crown. Knox qualified by
shellacking both Ripon (117.33),
seting a new Knox scoring rec-
ord, and Lawrence (72-50);
while Coe swept its last three
games, beating Grinnell (75.72),
st. Olaf (81-61), and Carleton.

The final standings were a
startling reversal of the stand-
ings at the halfway mark. At
that point, Knox led with an
unblemished 3—0 record, Carle-
ton was second at 6-2. and Coe
was mired in fourth with 4 and
4. But without Liston the Si-
washers managed no better than
an even split after the mid-
point. The Caris won four
straight, including a crucial vic-
tory over Knox, and took over
first place, Seemingly headed
for the title, Carleton unexpect-
edly dropped a game to St. Olaf,
a loss which turned out to be
disastrous. In the meantime, Coe
cmerged from its first-semester

doldroms, won eight straight,
and suddenly became a contend-
er, This marks the third con
secutive year in which the K0-
hawks have either won or shar-
ed the Championship.

Fourth place went to the sur-
prising Cornell Rams whose 74»
73 defeat of st. Olaf offset their
loss to Carleton. Picked for the
second division, the Rams were
sparked by a pair of sophomore
guards, Rich Merz and Ron Al-
tenberg. Monmouth‘s wins over
Lawrence (78-55) and Ripon
(84-70) enabled the Scots to
even their record at 8-8 and
finish fifth. Defending cc-
championa with Coe, the Scots’
offense failed to match their de-
fense, Monmouth yielded the
fewest points of any team in
the league, but outscc’ired only
st. Olaf and Lawrence,

st, Olaf, like Cornell, relied
largely on sophomores to finish
sixth, a couple notches higher
than expected. Crinnell ended
up in seventh, a potentially
strong team having been riddled
by injuries midway through the
campaign, mpon lost consistent—
ly on the road and disappointed
its followers by placing eighth,
For the third successive season,
Lawrence took the cellar.

Let‘s honor the guy who supplies the one cigarette that’s packed and
