this weekend that Lady Sings the
Blues is by far the superior one The
cinematography is excellent as are the
costuming and sets. in addition, the
film is set in the 1920’s and ’30's, a
period that I easily get romantic
about. Ms Russ‘s pertormanoe is
quite stunning, though i would have to
agree with most critics, including New
Yorker Magazine. in Stating that it
was unfortunate that the original
recordings were not used instead of
Ms, Ross's voice on the soundtrack,
but nevertheless, i would highly
recommend this film.

relationship as she is.

While the film's notices were mixed,
Penelope Gillialt of New Yorker
Magazine did say oi Clnnriiiie that it is
a ‘...sweet-spirited film, saddened and
rollicking, iull ot courage." However,
almost all the reviewers of the day did
say that the film stepped into
stereotypical roles too-easily. while I
have not seen this film before, 1 am
going off to see it and i will do my
best to duck the cliches, for it is billed
as a comedy!
