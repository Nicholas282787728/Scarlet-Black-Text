cat dog affair from start to fine
ish, tiie lead changed hands ten
times before Grinneli went ahead
to stay in the closing minutes.

The Pioneers bounced into an
early 5-2 lead, ,which quickly
evaporated under a Kohawk of-
Iensive flurry. The teams were
deadlocked 10.10 after ten mine
utes of play, and the score sec-
sawed back and forth, With Coe
holding an 15-17 edge at halfe
time.

After intermission the battle
royal continued unabated, with no
more than two points separating
the two quintets until the Ko-
hawks sailed into a 2944 lead
midway in the period.

With the eight hall staring
them straight in the face. the
Pioneers struck back, and Went
into a 31722 advantage with nine
minutes remaining in the ball

gin 42'33, and then Staved off
a desperate Coe rally to take
their fourth conference triumph
in seV-en starts.

“Tex” Kaufmann and “Rabbit"
Hart headlined the Grinnell ofe
tensivc with 12 and 11 points re-
spectively, although all Pioneers

Drake walloped Gl'lililell’s
cagers 51-33 Tuesday night
in the last game of the sea—
son for both teams.

Gi'innell held a slim lead
throughout most of the first
half, but a barrage of Drake
baskets in ’the first few min-
utes of the last half lint
Grilliiell behind by a margin
which was impossible to
erase.

Diake opened the scoring with
a field goal, but Griniicli soon we
thated with a bucket. Bucket foi-
bucket was matched as Hart
seemed unable to miss an the
shooting end of the Pioneer’s
fast bileak. Waters consistently
snagged the rebounds under the
Drake basket to begin each GFlH'
hell sally, The [not half drew
near its end with Grinneli leading
2047, although Drake sank a
field goal in the last few seer
onds to come within one point.

The Drake attack sizzled at
the opening of the second half as
Evans drove in tor a goal which
was followed by four Drake goals
and a. free throw against which
