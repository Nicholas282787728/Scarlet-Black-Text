An Opportunity to

Break Down Barriers

Erin Rounds

Relays XVI. It’s FINALLY here.
Many people have serious doubts
about the potential Success of this
weekend, but I think it is because
they are emphasizing the wrong
aspects of Relays. Common
perception is that Relays is
designed to reduce stress. This is
very true, but a ieature that most
people seem to be neglecting is the
uniiying force ol Relays.

For many years, one of the
significant differences between
other schools and Grinnell was
Relays. We had this amazing event
where everyone came together ior
three or tour days, partied their
asses 0“, and then went back to the
work at hand, This period of
orgiast‘ic, drunken revelry created
a sense ct community that is un-
precedented at other institutions.
Other schools may attempt com-
plete blowout bashes like this, but
the size of the college creates a
special intimacy that can be
recreated in very low other places.
For a iew days, we were all GRINr
NELLIANS, all special and unique
Irnm the rest of the world, but also
equal among ourselves. As at the
Alice in Wonderland party, we we
perienced this drug-induced alter-
ing of perception which served to
bring us all closer and do
emphasize the ditierences between
us Relays lowered the stress level
and enabled us to complete the rest
oi the semester without nipping
out completely, but it also made us
— all 1200 or us, and not just in
dividual cliques — family. We had
a common framework, a common
set of shared perceptions and ex-

. periences which no one outside oi

Grinnell could ever understand.

drug-induced communion oi

Alice and Relays served to bond us

- together in the same way that

psychedelic experiences have been

‘ highly influential in the formation

_ of religions 7 a common, extraorr

dinary experience permanently

a tied us together in a supportive

framework based on the revelar
< tions or the experience

OK, OK, so I'm romantiCizing.

" But Relays has been a very special

y event, and a lot of its Charm is has

ed on the way it unifies us into one

a body. I'm concerned that we won’t

permit ourselves to be unified that

- way this year. and that this divir
.

sion will be what is responsible for
the potential ‘failure' of Relays.

in the past twoand-a-halr years
it seems to me that Grinnell has
become incredibly cliquish.
EVERYONE who is ANYONE
moves 0“ campus at the start of
junior year, the prevailing attitude
suggests, It wasn’t that way when I
first got here, It wasn’t ‘cool' to
live on campus, but it wasn't so
blatantly ‘uncoal' either. And
because there were more ‘cool' upr
perclasspeople in the dorms. iresh
people had greater exposure to
Grinnell social norms. The on and
ofircampus crowds seem much
more defined and distinct now, so
there is less social pressure (or the
great mass of underclasspeople to
conform to specific standards, and
so the differences continue to in»
Crease. The two cultures are so
distinct now that it is very easy for
the two sides to see each other as
nothing more than tie-personalized
‘freaks’ and ‘dweebs.’

Then there is the drug problem,
It seems that the majority of
drinkers see the pot smokers as
‘druggedrnut hippies.‘ The pot
smokers apparently see the
drinkers as “drunken assholes '
Veggie House wants us to deal pot
to Solve the alcohol problem and
reduce campus suicide atlempLs,
No consideration is given to a
potential pot problem Some
drinkers want progressives but
don't want people to smoke in the
hallways. other drinkers get of»
{ended when people want to trip in
dorm lounges. The debate over
Relays/Peace Day on one level
seemed to be a dilemma between
smokers and drinkers I’m not try-
ing to rag on specific individuals.
but one Peace person commented
to the effect that she/he didn't
know how anyone could have iun
getting covered with musty beer.
Another wanted to get stoned and
jump in a jello pit. A third mention»
ed bashing drunks, I'm sure the
drinkers made elitist remarks
also; I just don't remember them

Obviously, there are other came
pus tensions; these are just the
ones that jump out at me. it seems
that Relays is the periect oppor
tunity to break these barriers
down. Perhaps, it we have the

Computers are Wonderful

John Newmark

Just a square screen, 40 to 50
keys, and a tow microchips.
However. With those simple ingrea
diei-its, a gourmet dish can be pro-
duced that would excite anyone's
taste buds: the computer. Whether
used for word processing, filing
systems, spread sheets, going to
the moon, or Pac Man, it is still a
wonderful machine. What would
We do without it? Well, we'd pro»
bably use Royal typewriters,
recipe boxes, pencils and paper,
our imaginations, and the family
Monopoly game. However, it
wouldn’t be the same

Computers are wonderlul. You
type on the keyboard as if it were a
normal typewriter, and the letters
appear on the screen. it the rays
that are being sent train the screen
begin to bother you, you can
decrease the intensity by deleting
some at the letters. Once you get
the preterred amount oi radiation
being aimed directly at your eyes,
you can save it in a tile Once you
have it saved. you can absorb the
rays any time you wish. All you
have to do is sit down at the CDm'
puter. load the file, and stare. 0h,
sometimes you can actually make
the words say something, and then
print the words out on a printer
The printer oiten makes lots or
noise, and during the day there are
a lot oi people in the terminal room
trying to tind out how much radia-
tion is perlect [or them, so I oiten
wait until 2 am, to use the printer,
so as not to bother anyone, The ter-
minal room is conveniently located
on the first iloor oi my dorm. Just
down the hall for those who live
there. I live on the third floor, but it
is still quite convenient,

People see me oiten sitting in
iront of a terminal, staring. They

 

usually want to know why i spend

so much time there. They want to
know what i am doing. They are
contused since 1 clearly can‘t have
a paper to write every day of the
year, but i am at the computers at
least once a day. They don't
understand that there is so much
else to do with a computer besides
writing a paper ior class. i have
created a tile which is loaded im-
mediately every time I log on. This
ﬁle changes all the commands so
that they make better sense.
Usually the computer uses a “s" as
the prompt for any command. I telt
the dollar sign was too symbolic oi
money and power. i changed the
prompt to, “Anything i can do,
Master?" 1 have also changed the
command Dir which stands {or
directory) to yes. No, Never.
Leave, and Eye all are various
ways {or me to log oil,

Besides making the computer
more ”user iriendly," i can talk
tor free to people at other colleges
and universities all over the na-
tion, i can also talk to students at
colleges in Paris, Rome, London,
Munich, and other cities world
wide I can call someone in Paris
and talk to him or her (or an hour.
since they usually only know
French, and i only English, we
might experience a row language
barriers. but it is still quite iun I
also oiten talk to my brother who
goes to a small college in New
Jersey which is overgrown with
ivy. I torget its name, but it begins
with a P. Anyway. we oiten send
messages to each other over the
computer, and since we know the
same language, we actually
uiideistand each other. This is
even more tun than talking to the
students in France No matter
whom i talk to, or where they
reside, the messages take a lew

minutes to arrive at their destinar
tion. A little slower than a
telephone, but a telephone costs
more. The computers are paid ior
through my tuition, There, I'd bet-
ter get my money's worth. i will
have to make a few thousand calls
a year over the computer, but you
have to do what you have to do.
As well as sending messages to
unknown people worldwide and
making the computer more user-
friendly, 1 also oiten do one more
thing, i play games. Not actually
games; games are not allowed on
the school computeis. However,
many students have set up pro»
grams which anyone can acciss
which can be categorized as
“things of the day." There's a joke
or the day, a Monty Python quote
of the day, a Star Trek quote of the
day, a humorous-proressor quote-
of the day, a thought oi the day.
and a pun oi the day. Last but not
