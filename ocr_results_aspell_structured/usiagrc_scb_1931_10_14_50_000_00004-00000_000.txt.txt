Coming back strong in the second
half of its game with Langdn. the
Dibble speedball team ran wild to win
its first game of the season Monday

Langan lcd 3 to 2 at the half by vir-
tue of a tight defense, but in the
third quarter, captain Ferrnra and
Straley led a driving offense which
piled up a big lead.

Tuesday the Rawson hall men took
Smith hall into camp 8 to 7 for their
first win in almost three years. It
was a ham-fought game, but a tight
defense completely sewed up
Gwynne—Vaughan, the Smith star,
and Allison, Maxfield, Woody. and
Wurl accumulated points consistent
ly to keep the Rawson team in the
lead. Allison's penalty kick in the
closing minutes accounted for the
margin of victory.

Aksel Nielson, Grinnell Junior,
Former Danish Olympic Member

 

Gymnastic apparatus in Denmark
is more complicated than that come
monly used in this country Aksel
Nielson, a former member of the
Danish Olympic team finds. Mr. Niel-
son is a junior at Gl-innell now and
assistant with tumbling and calis-
thcnics in the athletic department.

Parallel bars are seldom used in
Denmark, he says, but gymnasts op.
mate with boxes, built with slope
sides in layers which may bc removed
to give a variety of height barriers.

Work Togethei

Danish gymnasts travel in teams
and men work is uniform, When one
mcmber of the group is unable to
perform a part of the act it is not
performed. All of the men must know
the same routine.

Several years ago a boy of seven
was introduced by his father into the
fundamentals of gymnastics, as they
are taught in Denmark where the
subject is required ﬁve days a week.
The older Mr. Neilson was something
of a. tumbler himself and so his boy
should be.

With Bukli's Troupe

Later this young man become a
member of Niels Bulth's gymnastic
group and was entered in the Olym»
pic meet. Mr. Bukh is the head of a
people's college in Denmark.

Any person not planning to enter
a profession may attend one of these
people's colleges in Denmark. They
are private institutions and give a
liberal arts course. Students receive
no credit or diploma, however. The
college gives them an education and
student aid may be obtained from
the county or state.

Trained Daily

Money is given to the student who
is expected to teach in the country
when he has completed his course.
At these schools there are no exam-
inations. Bukh‘s school specialized in
physical training. These people’s col-
leges are the most important schools
in Denmark.

Prior to the Olympics, Askel and
his companions trained ﬁve hours a

Hank Thomas ace of the Pioneer
backﬁeld, outsmarted the Cornell
team Saturday, pulling off a play
rarely seen in middlewestern compe-
tition. After catching one of Bran-
dau's lengthy punts. Thomas stopped
in his tracks and booted the ball fai-
over the heads of players of both
teams before the opposition or spear
totors coultl ﬁgure out what was go-
ing on. Lake downed the ball ap»
proxnnately 25 yards back of the

spot the ball was put into play.
. . .

Before the ﬁeld was transformed
into a lake, McKee and Duncan, the
Grinncll ends, were on top of the re-
ceii-er each time the hull was piuitcd.
Deadly tackling by the Pioneer team,
lacking iit Cedar Falls, was in evi-
dencc.
. o a

Captain Chl'istoffersen deserves
some credit for the showing of the
team in the first three games. Dos-
pite a badly battered hand, his ace
curate passing and excellent defens-
ive play have been a consistently
outstanding feature of the work of
Coach Watt-s men.
