You may know her as one orthe most tal
ented people 1n imp1-ov,but for kite Thomas
'05, improv is only the beginning other talents.
Thomas, a vilmal celeblity on campus for her
performances with Ritalin Test Squad, brings
the same dcseriminating sense and aeurnen to
her many other activities.

Thomas, by all accounts, excels at a shock-
ing number of activities, from volleyball to
painting. In her “spare time" she works fllll
time with special needs elementary school stu-
dents and holds a part-time position at Family
Video.

“All together, it kind of fills the time." she
said, seemingly unaware that so many attivie
ties would clearly exhaust almost 1nyone else.
For most days over the past several weeks, she
has worked 11 her job at Fairview Elementary
School from 7 am. to 3:30 pm, worked at
Family Video from A p.111, to 5 pm. and then
had play practice for the community theater
unri110:30 pm.

Her schedule may be a little wild, but
whether she's playing a crazed murderer or a
love-crazed girlfriend, Thomas does every-
thing with a sense ofpurpose and order.

Thomas has a member of the improv
group Ritalin Test Squad since her junior year
in college‘giving her four and a half years
expetiencc entertaining Gtinellians. “Kate is a
rock orimprov,” said Renee Lynch '08, an im—
prov member and a friend ofThomits, Lynch
credits Thomas as the “historian" of the group,
the one who ensures that performances are re-
corded and remembered.

Perhaps some of her amusing eharace
ters and observations come from her job as a
pair educator at Fairview Elementary school.
Thomas has two students she works with one-
on-one. From 7:30 am. until noon, she works
with a nine yeareold girl, whom she's been
working with for the last year and a half. In
the afternoons, she works with a kindergar-
tener with autism.

Although she works specifically with two
students, Thomas has come to know many
kids at the school, and she's gotten used to
working with a younger world view than at
the college. “They’ll say weird stuff because
they’re slightly misinformed about something
and sometimes you try to steer them right a
little bit,"said Thomas, “and they're like,‘Your
eoneeption of the universe is ele1rly wrongi
rm seven,I know how it works.’ And you’re
Like ‘Oh no you don't!”

While Thomas had been interested in
teaching at Grinnell, she decided to try workin
the local school district before entering gradus
are school. "I didn't want to pay $30,000 for
a master's degree and then realize ‘Oh, totally

inappropriate for me," she said with 1 smile
Apparently, tenehing was not 1n1pp1op1i11te,
given that she will be moving to Camblidgc,
Mass. to begin work on her master's degrees in
elementary education and special needs educa»
tion at Leslie University.

In moving, Thomas will leave Grinnell, the
town she's caUed home for the last seven yczirs,
as well as shocking students who 1re accus-
tomed to her frequent performances.

However, Thomas’ performances rlont stop
with improv When shes not working paints
ing or improv»i11g,Thom-ns also plays guitar in
a local bluegrass group, Buckthorn, “i’m classi-
cally trained, but.. .no body else is, she said.
“So 1 play my classical guitar at the bluegrass
«troop, wh1ch i think looks a little funny "

Thomas ties to the community also come
in her recent play petfolrmance in town and
her participation in mul ripl e town volleyball
teams, continuing from her college career on
the team. "\lVe were co-ed champions," she
bragged. “I‘m supposed to get a shirt testify—
ing to the fact that l was on the team. It was
so exciting to be like ‘l'm on a team that won
a trophyr"

one senses that such experiences make
their way into her hilarious images oflife in
improv. Certainly, she borrows from her inn
credible knowledge of film.

She's familiar with old movies and new
ones, foreign and mainstream. “I think she’s
probably the most 0\’€i’*qunl.iﬁed person [to
work at Family Video] in history."

Thomas is h1ppy talking about movies
both speciﬁcally and in theory, “Any movie
that is predicated on the notion of women be-
ing victlmlzcdiyou always have to wateh 1t
and be like ‘What’s the objective?'"she said.

She even loves classic scary ﬁlms such as
Psyr/Je. "The famous shower scene in it I don't
and scary," she explained 1 little later. “It’s inn
tense. I don't find scary.'l'here’s a later death in
it that makes me jump every time."

Butwhen she's notanalyzing ﬁlms,Thomns
sometimes finds more bizarre ways to be witty,
Though she said she only paints “amateureishe
l)’,"Thomus is nonetheless excited about work
ing on a collection of paintings of animal puns.
“Caught lyin"’ shows a lion chained to a wall
and “Barely there" depicts a faint outline of a
teddy bear with very clear eyes. Her favorite
is spring Robbin" “it's Just a little rob1n,1nd
Im still happy bee1use the robin actually looks
Like a robin,” she said. And it has a little banv
dit mask on, and there’sjust like a little bag of
money next to it.l thought it’d be a really {on
kids' book thing," she said.

As Thomas emphasizes, she’d mther watch
a movie or paint a picture than go out to par
ties. This preference makes it easier for her to

draw lines between her life on— and ogncamn
pus. “I've sort of made at concerted effort not
to make my social life around the college," she
said, 1dding later that "most or my social-shirt
is very activity- oriented."

As she leaves Grinnell and improv for the
East Coast, students can assume she will ap-
proach all her activities with the same dry and
funny attitude that has characterized her time
here.

te s Picks. Five movie recommendations from Kate Thomas

The Good the Bad and the Ugly
”It’s great. Clint Eastwood wears a poncho in
it. There is so much clothing lust that goes on
when I watch old Westerns.”

Valerie and Her Week of Wonders
”This weird Czechoslovakian new wave film
about this girl. It’s like this whole big analogy
for female sexuality, but it’s got these weird
who/e layered mythologies in it and some bi-
zarre sequences. It’s kind ofa cool portrait of
how puberty and becoming an adult can be
scary and exhilarating You won’t forget it.”

High and Low

”It’s about this guy who’s really wealthy and
he’s pooled all of his money and liquefied it
and his son is outside playing with the chauf-
feur’s son and the chauffeur’s son gets kid-
napped but they think it’s the rich guy’s son.
And they make this huge ransom demand and
the chauffeur can’t pay it and he has to beg the
rich guy.

The ﬁrst half is sort of a class-politics thing—
should he pay for the chauffer’s son? And the
second half is this weird police investigative
thriller it’s that old-school police investiga-
tion stuff. There are like 77 movies who com»
p/etely ripped off entire sequences [from High
and Low .”

Wings of Desire
”SQ, good I thought. Colombo is in it, Peter
Fa/k is in it. There were parts of it that I just
thought were so cool.
There are so many movies that are remakes
of foreign movies and [just want to say—N0
Reservations? Mostly Martha.”

Marlin
”It’s about this guy named Martin, and he
thinks he's a vampire. And one of the lingers
ing questions throughout the movie is is he or

‘i5n ’t he?

The guys who plays Martin—he is so good.
He looks like a real person. He’s strang/ey
charismatic for such a strange person.”
