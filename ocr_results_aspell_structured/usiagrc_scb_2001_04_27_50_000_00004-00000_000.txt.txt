Au Fait

By Sarah Aswell
Aris Ediior
In January and
February there were
times when i skipped
class just because it
was too darn cold for
me to walk to class.
,Now that it is almost
May, I get to skip class
because the weather is
too nice for me to be
indoors.
Regardless of the
reason, skipping class
every so often is a
mainstay of the college
experience. I don’t
know about you, but
my acquaintances
never seem to tell me
stories about that
crazy time they
decided to attend their
Russian literature Class
and everything went to
hell when they lost
Dave in Montezuma
and their clothes got
stolen while they were
skinnyrdippirlg and
then when the police
showed up they had to
explain the pot-bellied
pig sitting shotgun.
Sure, Tolstoy is
important 7 ir he
weren't you wouldn't
have signed up for the
class — but sometimes,
three or four times a
week, you have to he
educated by life, not
some timeless classic
book that delves deep
into the meaning of
life, but life. Plus,
Tolstoy is way boring.
One must keep in
mind, however, that
there are sometimes
consequences to
skipping class, such as
having way too much
fun, not understanding
the ﬁner points of
glycolysis when you
are asked to explain
them on the ﬁnal.
getting sunburned,
feeling a ﬂeeting sense
of guilt, and receiving
Frisbee and/or Pop
Rock injuries. But
these consequences
are nothing in
comparison to great
fun and lack of lecture
that you get from
simply not going to
class.
Perhaps skipping class
will slightly effect your

GPA in a negative way,_

but when you go to
job interviews you can
claim to have the
people skills that all
class-attending nerds
so seriously lack.
Remember: nobody
wants to hire a dorky
classrattending nerd.
And if they do, I don't
want to work under
them, they’re probably
one of those nerds who
attended class on
beautiful April
afternoons, the nerds.
