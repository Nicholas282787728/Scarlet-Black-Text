Two Camps Spend Quiet
Night » Sophs Out-
Numbered 2 to 1.

In the best exhibition of straight
fighting Lhntlllds been seen on the
campus [or years, the sophomores
were victor-ions in the annual class
scrap which was held .llonday night
and Tuesday morning. About one
hundred and ten preps, led by Carl
Johnson, and approximately filly live
soplrs, headed by Charles Irwin, par»
ticipated in the contest. The night
was an unusually quiet one and there
was little action save for occasional
raiding parties wlrrclr captured
freshmen and three sophomores.

when the final .histle blew, it was
discovered that a scab u as untied and
the second year men were declared
the winners of the scrap. The judges
were w, T. Sher-man, Bernard Guern-
sey, Layer-ire Harter, williarn Fancy,
and William Her-brechtsmeyer,

Meet on him ~ Lawn

The treshmen met on the campus
at nine’ o'clock and marched to thc
iairgrounds where they built a fire,
served refreshments, and spent the
greater par-t of the night. Raiding
parties were going and coming and
two parties uret in Professor Allny's
yard at about one o'clock. The preps
succeeded in capturing two of the en-
eniy, while the rest made their es-
cape. The freshmen moved into town
shortly after one, and established tern»
porary headquarters on third street.

Sophs Out 0i Sight

The sophomores met in the club»
room of building Ill, and, then, prolit»
ing by the experience to last year's
class, steered clear of the canrpus and
headed for open country. They cs-
tablished themsell'es in a cornfield
northeast of the country club where
they spent the rrrght. The only time
that the preps were near. was iii the
early morning. when, after a. run of
about a mile, they air ed in time to
hear the five o'clock whistle blow for
the cessation of hostilities, and to see
the chuckling soplrs emerge from their
leafy retreat.

Baltimore, a soph, was the only
casualty of the night, altho bloody
noses and bruises and scratches were
plentiful. In an error-t to escape a

raiding party, Baltimore ran into al

tree and was captured. He was taken
to the le’mS and held there. The
hearts of the sophs were gladdened by
the return of Sleigh D on, last year's
scrap leader, who arrived in Griunell

No Faculty Oppo-
sition as Oldest
Tradition Passes

Another tradition gone smash!
And nobody littered one word
against the brcalting of Griunell’s
oldest tradition. In fact, cu.
body seemed lather happy to know
that such a thing could happen.
Many there are, who still think
that something must be wron
and that old man Flurius niuszt
have gotten his dates mixed. llut
whatever the cause, the fact still
remains that Grinncll Collcge he»
gan the year 192041 without the
usual accompanymcnt of the rain
drop chorus.

It seems that long years ago—
, so long ago that even Prof. Hen-
drirson cannot remember the time
the weather man decreed that be»
ginning on the first registration
day, it should rain continuously
until at least the night of the
general reception. Old Pluvius,
however, has sometimes had pity
on the inhabitants oi Grlunell,
and has departed so tar as to give
us only one or two days of rain
with which to begin the year, but
never before in the history of
Grinnell College has he iett us
alone so completely as 2he has
this year.

Professor L. D. Hartsou nresentedi
the faculty point of view with regard
to the Association rvork. “We are en—
thusiastic," he said, "at the opening,
of the seventyhfth college year, a
year that we believe will prove the
most succ‘essiul in the history or Grin»
nell. We are enthusiastic because oi
the new prominence of the chapel ser-
vices and the Christian Associations.
These two hold a central place in col»
lege life and are the most common
agencies and active force tor the lil—
tration or the ‘splril. ot Gl'inuell.’
The Christian Association is a demo»
crstrc organization, one in which we
may all unite, the only one that goes
limo every phase of our college lite,
‘It is' the feeling of common hrothc
hood and service in our moral. social,
and business lives, that makes the ASA
socrations worthy of support."

House Chairmen Elected in Six of
Men’s Halls — May‘ Have

Plans for the reorganization of the
men's senate and the government at
the dormitories were discussed in
house meetings in each of the men’s
halls Sunday night. House chairmen
and representatives in the men's
senate \vele elected iir each building.
Other olliccr , which include, secre-
tar-ics, treasurer, social chairmen,
etc, have not been annourrccii.

building Three, Fred Winter; Build»
Building
Five, Jolm Decker, Building six, Allan
Hicks, Tlrcse and three other men
from each building will [arm the
men's senate, it that organization
sull 'es the reorganization plans.

Little Soul of Senate
Pi-olessor D. D. Griffith, chairman
of the house committee lor riicn last;
year, is assisting th'c administrationl
arid the men of the dormitories in
making a workable plan of dormitory
government. Little need of a general
organization was shown last year, and
m the years previous, since it has been
the policy ol President .uain to let!
each building of the group construct
its own rules and make them fit the
needs of the men living in that par-
ticular building.

The function of the men senate.
last year was to bring repr-eseota»
tires of the men together in one or»
garrizatiou, to be on an equal with they
women’s league board at the Quad»
rangle. although not or the same exact
type. Plans for improvement of co
drtions at the dormitories were di
cussed and passed upon by the body,
and the senate was instrumental in
starting the ice rink which never ma»
teria .ed north of the dormitories
last umter.

It is liopcd by the eonrnuttce in
charge to make a statement of the
new plan of ndini istralion in the near
future.
