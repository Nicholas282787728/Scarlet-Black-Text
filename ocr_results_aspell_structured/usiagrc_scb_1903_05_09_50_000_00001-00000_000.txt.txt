DRAKE WINS DUAL MEET.

Final Score 59-54-

Drake won the dual meet rhis
afternoon at \rVaitl Field. The
large crowd otstutlents which was
expected to accompany the team
failed to materialize, probably on
account of the rain in Des Moines
this morning. Drake won all three
places in each of the weight
events, thus securing a lead of 24
points. Chapman failed to break
the world's record in the vault but
raised the state record. The dis-
cus record was also broken. Hen-
yan did ﬁne work in the dashes
and Bair in the broadjump, The
mile relay was a walk away.

HONOR o.

There has been considerable
misunderstanding since the Antes
meet with regard to thi: winning
of the Honor G. There are at
present no provisions for winning
the G on the track. The matter
is in the hands of the board of
Control which will in the course
of time publish the new con
ditions. The old provisions were
a ﬁrst at a dual mcct rtitli a large
school, ﬁrst or second at state or
membership in a winning i'clay at
state. Membership in a winning
relay on a ﬁrst place at triangular
also gave a G. But no provisions
were ever in torcc giving members
of relay teams in dual meets the

 

Honor G.
