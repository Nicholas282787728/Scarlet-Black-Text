Distance Ace Dave Qutub -*
Predicts Strong Season

by Denny Watson

Few of the students at Grin-
nell know that they are going to
school with the Jordanian record
holder in the mile run. Dave
Qutnvli, Cowles‘senior, captured
this honor while attending high
school in Ramullah, Jordan. The
wiry little political science major
stated that it wasn't as easy to
accomplish this in Jordan as
it would he in this country, l-le
ran barefoot and without any
coaching whatsoever, something
which takes a lot of determina-
tion.

The little Arahian commented
that he likes to run as well as
he likes to eat and anyone who
has seen him run or has run
with him can verity this state-
ment irom his performances. He
is the memher of the Coe Relays
record holding distance medley
team which won that event
again this year.

compete on these teams helped
me greatly with my adjustment

Home Season

Wl’rh Simpson. Cenl'ralTeams

Simpson and Central colleges provide the 1955 Grinnell col-
lege track team with its initial home competition of the young
outdoor season. It will he the first opportunity tor the school to
see the team in action. The meet will be held next Tuesday alter-

noon on Ward. field.

Simpson will be without their
crack broad-jumper of last year,
PexTy Wilkins, who won his
specialty along with both ﬂashes
in last year's dual meet which
Grinnell won RZ‘é-Sﬂé. How—
ever the Simpson squad pro-
duced numerous good perfor-
mances in heating Central 751/:
to 551/2 earlier this year and
are expected to give the home
team Grinnelllans a real battle.

Grinnell Weaknesses

Although Central lacks depth
in some events, they have an
outstanding athlete in Hal Hieme
stra who excels in the hurdles
and 440.

Grinnell’s biggest weaknesses
appear to be in the high jump,
while there is a lack of depth
in the shot put, pole vault,
hroad jump and hurdles.

Leading the squad will be the
Pioneer middle distance run»
hers. The tin-yard dash will
prohahly have Jim Kingland,
Frank Hays, Bill Largent, or
Gary Hayes. Hayes and King-
land will also go in the half-
mile event. In add ion to his

a very strong team to the con—
iercnce meet this your. . .per-
sonally rm hoping to take ﬁrst
in the two mile and help in
the relays.”

A four year letterman in track
and cross—country and an active
member of the Cosmopolitan
club of which he was one time
president, Dave plans to come
back here next year to pick up
some extra credits and help
coach the cross country team.
He then will go to graduate
school where he plans to special-
in in MiddleeEasbern politics.
