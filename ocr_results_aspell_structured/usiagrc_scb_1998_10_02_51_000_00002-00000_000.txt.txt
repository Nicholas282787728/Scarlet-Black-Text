Byron Worley was warm with his
clue that the Rotund Mystery Object
was a decorative cap from a radiator,
probably a Ford, or a grease cap at the
end of the axle to keep the grease in.
And so was Jeff Hubbcll of Ladora,
who also saw it in the Extra and who
called it a grease cap for a wagon
wheel.

Both were a little off so when Haines

early Ford automobile, Around was
overjoyed,
