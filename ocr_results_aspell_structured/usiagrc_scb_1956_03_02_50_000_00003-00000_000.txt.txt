Candidates' Backers Gila Reasons For Support

‘Pete Kizer

The position of Student Coun-
cil president calls for a person
91' fmceml character. It demands
a realization of the tasks before
him and what he must do to ac-
complish these tasks. I Believe
that these two factors go hand
in hand in the making 01 a‘ good
Student Council president

In the past years, at least one
of these factors has'been missing
and as a result student govern
ment has been in&iective .in re-
lation to is yurpose. With the
advent of a new constituuun and
the possibility oli uniﬁed student
govermnent, the need for a per-
son possessing these twa char-
acteristics is greater than ever
before. Pete Kizer has ~mhese
characteristics. ,

Pete Kizer has the experience
of organization and leadership
dating back to his army days and
the positions he has held on this
campus. 1 offer the example of
his being station manager of
KGRW which is a’ position that
calls for clear organizational de-
velopment by the laden

Art Travers

After examining the platiorms
and qualifications or the candi-
dates I decided that Art Travers
was the man [or the job. His
platform is specific and as cons
cl'el‘ as it can be under the
present confused set-up.

There is no candidate which
approaches llim- as far'as ex-
pcricncc in studcnt government
concerned. He has served on

apl‘ing‘as treasurer, l-lc has been
the c of HP reporter tor a year
and a half. He is thoroughly
grounded in the problems.

As the campaign went on he
stressed the issues and appealed
to the native intelligence oi the
students,
rhcrc is no ddubt in my mind
that he is the man for the job.

Jubilantly leading a great
