IT’S UP TO YOU

Once again the time for the annual Grill-
nell Student Conference on International Ile-
lotions has rolled around This meeting, fonnclr
ed ollly four years ago, has grown to be a big?
event on the Grinnell campus. Each year the
Conference committee arranges an outstanding
list of speakers who are experts in their field.

Grinnell students are all considered‘ as her
inf,r delegates to the Conference. Each and eve
ery one of you can gainsomething by attend-
ing the lectures and the round table discus-
sions. Not all of the student body believe as
most of the members of the Conference (lo ; nev»
ertheless it is helpful and stimulating for con:
tocts to be made with people who differ with
you. The Conference is offering each and ev-
ery student of Grinnell an opportunity to hear
and question speakers who are authorities in
their fields. By so doing the stdent body is
given an opportunity to really become informed
upon natioial and international subjects.

That each and every college student should

inform himself concerning the problems of tlnl
present (lay world, goes without saying. Here
i. an opportunity for you to increase your fund
of information. and at no extra cost. ll will be
up to you whether or not you got the most belt-

THINGS A GOOD TEACHER DOES NOT DO . ..
(Daily O‘Colleginn)

1t is too much to expect perfect professors just
as it 15 too much to expect perfect students, But
too many professors lack the elements that go to-
ward making an individual a good teacher.

If teachers at this school were rnnked accord
ing to their ability to teach their subject, more than
75 per cent would fall in the “C" class or below. By
teaching a subject -we do not necessarily mean
knowledge of the subject but the ability of the
teacher to impart his knowledge and textbook mar
terisl.

The good teacher never:

1. Talks in such a monotonous tone that it lulls
the student to sleep. .

2. Talks in such a low tone that he cannot be
heard distinctly.

2. 1s discourteous to his students!

4. Never brags about how tough he is.

5. Permits himself to let personal feelings modir
fy his grading.

6. Tells the same jokes, year after year,

7. Thinks materiel used in 1930 is good enough
for 1935.

8. Glories in trying to give catch examinations.

9. 1s careless with his English.

10. Becomes one»sided——thinks his subject is the
only one, that it should come first always with the
student.

11. Acts like a robot.

12. Treats a student as is student treats him.

13. Assigns examinations before holidays.

14., Thinks his own opinion abides is faultless,

15. 1s conceited enough to tell the students that
he knows more than does the author of the textbook
from which he is teaching. 1

16. Considers students as machines.

17. Fol-gets that he was once a student him-
self.

15. Refuses to admit an error.

19. Fails in trying to»matke the lesson as inter-
esting and fresh as possible.

20. Fails to take as active 3 part in student and
faculty functions as possible

The bugles and the drums will have to sound
much more loudly this time thsn before if the
munitions makers again want American youth to
fight their battles for them. Legislation and under-
standing has made it tougher sledding for war
propaganda.

 

Depression Lowers
Medical School Standards

Chicago, Ill. (ACP)—~The stand—
ards of the medical schools, once
among the highest, have been low.
ered in recent years, asserted The
Journal of ’tbe American Medical
Association in this year's review of
educational conditions in the
United states and Canada.

Undermnnned faculties, over—
crowded lahoratories and the ac-
ceptance of students of below-par
scholastic records have resulted in
’an impairment of efficiency, ac-
cording to the publication.

Responsibility for the situation
is largely attributed to financial
stringency during the depression,
which has compelled some schools
to rely more largely on income
from student fees. The Journal
says that larger numbers of stud—
cnts have been accepted for the
money they bring in, polntlng‘out
that in most cases the teaching
staff has not been corrspondingly
strengthened or the physical plant
commensurately enlarged.

Mr. and Mr. J. E. Robb of Des
Molnes visited their son Richard
'39, Sunday.

DORIC

(ll Column of pure bounty)

Doric again, and quite a bit of
material for you scandalrlovers to
chew on. First, though, we are go-
ing to permit ourselves the luxury
of wondering just how much truth
there is in the report that a few
more mcmbers of the staff of the
Scarlet and Black aro going to be
immortalized in the Maltcascr's
“Blackbcll Court," Possibly “Stool
Plgeon” Searle can give us the
necessary information. Well our
thenticatod evidence states that
she writes them, then brags about
‘em. For which, sour horseradish
to her.

Mr. Roy Wylie and Miss Nancy
Robertson wish to announce that
by mutual agreement, they are
NOT keeping steady company. Mr.
Wylie’s office hours are from
noon to 9 p. In. every day. (AD-

Which makes Roy and Nancy
something of rugged individualists.

Johnny Bucldey, who has done
such a good jab of crawling out

will climb back into it very

May—Floyd sinex is beginning
to Wonder whether Huston is a
jinx or not. T'othel' day they
were reclining at their ease in
the country when who should
stumble on (or over) them but
one of Mr. Comrd’s classes out
for a strou. A trifle embarrass
ing. Then Sunday night it took
the combined assistance of the

ditch. You’d thing it was spring.
