Prof disgusted with student behavio

Dear Editor,

Your published laments over the demise
0i ARH auditorium as a movie theatre in~
Vite the perspective of one who has had an
office in ARH for seventeen years and uses
it on weekends. Last Saturday morning i
found the third floor treated to lots of smle
beer, vomit, one vandalized fire ex-
tinguisher, and a pool of water that had
flowed into the hallway from a sink pluggr
ed_ with paper. The mess was timely for
this debate, but not at all unusual, in fact
rather tame beside some capers of the
past: extinguishers dropped down the
stairwells, thermostat housings pulled
from the walls and thrown through win-
dows, mirrors broken, and, of course, the
unique trashing of the movie screen during
the ,Rocky Horrors Show — the night
nature imitated “art", These things annoy
me, but tire i iear. One may gauge this
hazard merely by surveying the context oi
cigarette butts, combusﬂble material and

chaos after a movie, For those who think
that my View is overdrawn I shall be glad
to give a tour some weekend morning, or
introduce the employees who have ior
years ban quietly cleaning up and repair-
ing these iiascos.

No pressure, peer or superior, has .been
able to curb this feral fun. If it is only
natural ior some people to drink to excess,
and {or some of these to go gonzo, and for
others to find these entertaining, and if the
College concurs that all of this is necessary
for the mental health of these poor souls, to
give them escape from the terrible stress
and ennui of this place, so be it. But not in
mis building. Let them have their own
combat zone. Concrete will do nicely, with
sloping drainage and hoses so that B&G
can clean it up without degrading
themselves. Fireproof, indestructible, and
cheap. We will not even need to pay an ar-
chitect. Any tarmer can show us how to
build it, 7 G.V. Lalonde

Draus Column Sexist

Dear Editor. .
lam appalled that two such incongruous
articles like “Homophobia Acts Scorned"
and Paul Draus' sexist column (November
7 or the Scarlet and Black) can appear on
the same page of the newspaper while i
applaud the intent oi Sara Diechman's let»
ter. I am oiiended by Draus' column.
First, I am oiiended by Draus' “compli-
ment” that “there's nothing wrong with
women at Grinnell l' To reduce women to
“girls who aren‘t as gullible” is both a
linguistic insult idoes Draus call himseli a
"boy”"l and a personal insult. Gullible
means easily iooled . , . easily iooled
comes pretty close to stupid. Draus'
characterization oi dcsireable “coeds" by
their relative degree oi gorgeousness and
gullibility IS a perfect example of the sex-
ist patronizing aiieciioii that degrades
women and men I can do without
Furthermore, the entire tone oi Draus'
article is unbearably sexist and
disrespectful. Draus is willing to “con
thousands oi diiicrcnt girls into dating
him." while acknowledging that “girls”
should be warned oi his presence In light
of the rest of the article. I don'l wonder
why women should be warned Sexist at
titudes lead to sexist behavior.
which leads me to my second point lam
angered by Draus' characterization oi the

"young women in jammies.” Not only is
Draus' use oi the diminutive “jammies”
insulting, but Draus has unbelievable gall
to claim he was “jumped" when he goes on
to talk about rape. Rape is no JOKE, and
to dismiss the rightiully deionsive woman
as a ”paranoid, deienseless dorm-girl" is
irightening. Although I realize that Draus
was probably nervous and obviously didn't
want to go to the police station, 1 am upset
that Draus did not consider the implica
tions oi a “big rape scare " Nowhere does
Draus acknowledge the terrible
seriousness oi rape and the validity or the
woman's questioning Draus’ apathetic ap
proach to rape and his utterly seliish
perspective on the situation is cause ior
alarm.

Finally. “the i-eadcr is probably asking.
‘You stupid jerk, why didn‘t you think oi
that beiore you decided to go to Grinnell?

“That's exactly the question i was ask-
ing myseli as I sal there in mute bewilderr
ment. staring my myopic eyeballs out" at
this blatantly Sexist. oiiensive article. Like
Dcichman. I thought I could ”take solace
in the thought that Grinnell is a liberal.
opcnrminded, peaceful society " Draus'
attitude is a counter example.

i hope Draus' “view irom the bottom” is
not taken by those at the top. - ltcbccca

Senior disillusioned , with “Grinnell Experience”

To the editor:

This letter is a result oi a years oi tension
that has been brewing inside oi me. Recent
events have iorced me to express these
ieelings publicly. I have become pro»
gressively disillusioned with the “Grinnell
Experience “ Although only a iew isolated
events have led to these feelings, l citen
iind myseli blaming everyone. What are
these isolated events, one might ask? Read
on.
isolated event I.’ As music director oi
KDIC, I make a concerted eiiort to bring
new and diversified music to the Grinnell
campus. The KIDC staii works hard to
keep 33.5 a progressive and competitive
dial location across the country. From
this, one would think all is rosy in radius
land. Uniortunately, a iew individuals ieel
that building their personal record library
is more important than expanding the
record library at KDIC. why would an in
dividual committed to “build a strong

community and make an institution Work"
periorm such a degenerative acti Perhaps
the Honor system. something Iwas taught

to obey early on in my Grinnell career, is
no longer in eiiect at Grinnell. ii so, i
would like to retake a few exams l have
had trouble with in the past. Despite many
valiant efforts by the KDIC staff, album
theft continues, probably as i write this lets
ters. A cause [or disillusionment? You tell
me. .

isolated event 2: i have always enjoyed
a good joke. Some might say humor is in
my blood. Because oi this, i find any ge~
nuine attempt at humor, whether verbal or
written, somewhat enjoyable. Writers
irom Mark Twain to Andy Rooney have
always made me laugh. Their ability to
take the mundane and turn it into a witty
piece oi text has always amazed me. Many
oi these more popular writers probably
gained a great deal oi their writing ex-
perience during their college years, pro
173ny on campuses much like Grinnell.
Following my reasoning stated above, I
must have a great deal oi respect ior those
pursuing writing here at Grinnell. I do.
with one minor exception. Whenever soc
meone attempts to inhibit the prose of

another, I must draw the line.

Take one young Kristen Pullen, for ex-
ample. She believes, if i am not mistaken,
that individuals who use their college
years to learn how to express themselves
more eiiectively, have no place at Grin-
nell. I think her problem arises, however,
from a great deal of confusion she seems to
possess about writing in general, Because
Ms. Pullen does not seem to grasp certain
concepts iound in everyday his, I will
enlighten her a bit. The iirst concept,
utilized in Mickey Munley's column, is
called, a “playvonawords,” in response to
her question “Exactly what does ‘Quiet as
a Mouse' signify,” I direct her attention to
another concept called ”Disney cartoons.“
Perhaps while Ms. Pullen was “trying to
get the most irom [her] education" in pre
school, she may have missed these cars
toons. Anyway, there is a mouse whose
iirst name happens to be, you guessed it,
Mickey. Get it? (Disney cartoons also use
something called personification too, Ms.
Pullen, but I don’t want to confuse you fur-
ther.) Reading on, it appears Ms Pullen
has trouble with yet another idea known as

“cognition." She questions. “Where does
he get his ideas for his columns?" Without
gettting technical, Ms. Pullen. we can all
saiely assume Mr. Munley gets his ideas
from within himself, probably, as you so
astutely observed, irom somewhere in his
gray matter. That is the beauty of an
editorial, it reflects the ideas of an inc
dividual. Perhaps you "get’oii," as you so
eloquently put it, on the pseudor
intellectual masturbation that so often ap-
pears in black and white. In that case, I
suggest you simply re-read your letter to
the editor.

1 could go on and on about things that are
causes for my disillusionment, but I have
just come to an' important realization.
Grinnell is not the cause of my conflict.
The problem lies in those individuals that
are detracting from my “Grinnell Exc
perience," the undereducated. Maybe if
we would all band together, we could help
re—educate these poor lost souls, sterilized
of the liberal education we all strive to
achieve. Or maybe we're content to watch
Grinnell become just another college. 7
