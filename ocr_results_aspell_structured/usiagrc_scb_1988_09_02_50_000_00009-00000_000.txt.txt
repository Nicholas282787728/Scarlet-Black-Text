Prints. Drawings, and Paintings

lower level Burling Library. The
exhibit opens today. Friday,
September 2 at 4:15, with a
gallery talk by the artist. The 35
piece show contains works dis»
playing Meyers‘ technique in a
variety of media: intaglio print-
ing, engraving. drypoint,
gouache. pencil, charcoal, and
chalk. That the works are all
landscapes, provides the viewer
with several approaches to View
ing the show.

One approach is to examine
how each medium can convey
entirely different emotions and
qualities of the depicted land
scape. Meyers‘ prints have deeper
and richer value structures.
whereas the pencil sketches range
from rough delineation of forms
to delicate outlines of tree
branches. An uncommon tech-
nique that can be seen in this
show is the incorporation of gold
and silver leaf into the inmglio
process. Because a reﬂective
material is used, the impact of
light on these four prints is in
credible. Meyers’ use of foil leaf
not only lends itself to wonderful
color harmonics, but as the
viewer approaches each print
from different angles, the light

shifts and reflccs from various
surface areas, capturing the dimer
dimensionality of landscape. In
this sense, the foil is used to Na
lustrate to the viewer that land
scape is ever-changing.

Attention to Meyers‘ selective
use of color is another method to
approaching these works. The
first five pieces in the show are
gouache studies of ﬁre, predomi»
nantly using a palette of oranges,
yellows and reds. These
works provide an almost a direct
contrast with Meyers' pencil
studies of trees, which feel as
though they were drawn as icy
winter scenes. In these pieces,
the viewer is shown barren stands
of leaﬂess trees: even those penr
eiled works that contain color,
such as "Trees and Winter Sun-
set", still carry the winter-like
quality seen in those that are
black and white. The "Foggy
Day" series contains very little
color; and the shapes we are al-
lowed to see through the fog
Meyers creates are virtually re-
duced to abstraction. The varia-
tion of colors Meyers chooses in
her gouaches correspond to the
scenes she is depicting: the wide
range of muted colors in
"Sinking Landscape" to the relaa

Lastly. it is important to as
sess each work individually.

will not only increase one's ap-
preciation of the individual
works, but should also contribute
to a better understanding of the

and reﬂection seems to be the key
to fully appreciating the particur

Meyers endeavors to convey.

Review of Mini
Print Biennial

by Caty Forden

Everyone will find
something they enjoy in the
Miniature Print Biennial
1987 on display now in the
Burling Gallery, lower level of
Burling Library, This show of
156 prints from artists residing in
the United States and twenty-
threc foreign countries, represents
a wide range of styles, tones and
cultural perspectives. Each
miniature print, roughly two by
two inches. invites the viewer to
look more closely at these
powerful images.

While some artists emphasize
putt: line and Simple shapes, as in
Jaime M. Osorio's etching of two
figures embracing. "Sin Titulo,"
other artists aim for more com-
plex studies of color, line. and
shape. In "Concerto," one of
Marcy Shear Wolpe’s screenprints
of interiors, greens, Violets, and
oranges intermingle to capture
the atmospheric light that falls
into the room.

As each artist's style varies
from a tightly controlled ap,
proach to a looser approach, tone
also varies. In David Cook's

    

award winning etching with
aquatint. "The Meeting," an ex-
aggerated hand gestures to shake
as a head peers down suspi-
ciously. The playful sections of
head, arm, and hand float against
a collage of patients. In contrast.
strong vertical and diagonal
movements in Royden Card's
"Road, Polo" evoke a tone of
solitude and fear.

Several images not only rev
fleet the artist‘s individual style
and tone, but also attest to the
artist's own culture. Miehio
Tcramoto‘s quiet screenprints
"Form A" and "Form B," show a
napkin and dipper used in tradi-
tional Japanese tea ceremonies.

With varied approaches to
style and tone. these artists prove
the limitless possibilities in
working in a miniature scale.
This show gives us a rare oppor-
tunity to view a "microscopic“
selection of international prints.
The exhibition is sponsored by
the International Graphic Arts
Foundation, USA. and will be on
display in Burling Gallery until
September 30th.
