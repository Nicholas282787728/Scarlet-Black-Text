After nearly a century of de»

chitecture, William Brumsfield, pro—
fessor of slavic studies at Tulane
University and lecturer at the archi-
tectureschool.spent three yearspho—
togtaphing the remains of the struc—
tures Bnitnsfield was in Grinnell
this week to present the Russian Art
of Building in Wood photography
exhibit.

He gave a talk on the subject
last Wednesday night. The lecture
highlighted the different styles of
building with wood. Examples of
ornately fashioned domes were
shown. According to Erumﬁeld, the
domes were made from ashen which
ages to a silver hue. Brumfield also
explained tent tops and octagonal
basesasmodesofconsttuction. Hous»
es made from wood were also shown.
Construction varied in different re—
gions. in contrast to the north where
barns were attached, they were not
attached to the houses in the south.
This is only one example of the many
ways in which architecture varied
throughoutRussiai Most ofthe pho—
tographs were from the eighteenth

Much of Russian architecture
was done with omate wood through
the nineteenth century. Unfortu»
nately, due to the Communist re»
gime, many of the churches were not

maintained. Now many museum
parks have been established to pre—
serve the best stnictures. Interest«

wood has been replaced for the ex»
hibits and the original wood is in
storage.

The photographs tire on display
in an exhibit entitled “The Russian
Art of Building in Wood" at the
Burling Gallery from October 25
through November 30. Thirryrwo
