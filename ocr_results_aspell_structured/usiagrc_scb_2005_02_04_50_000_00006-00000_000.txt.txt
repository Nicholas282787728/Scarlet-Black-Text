av CARL FALCON 8i MAC POHANKA

When we ﬁrstfound out that the new Strand movie theater in
town was giving away free movie tickets for this past weekend, we
knew that they were bribing us to drag us lILWQ were also skeptical
orrvherher we would go back if we had to pay astronomical ticket
Prices, but we were proven wrong on both accounts, we will be going
back especially because aside from being a brand new theater Grille
nell students will be able to purchase 54 movie tickets.

When we entered under the marquee on Main Street we were
greeted by friendly service, a clean and open lobby and reasonably
priced concessions for n therrer, Although individual drinks pope
corn and candy are as expensive as you would expect, thcn combo
deals were very reasonable and {at better then the average down-
town theater, including the 8‘) bottomless two large sodas and large
popcorn combo.

With stadium-style seating, "wicked good" sound and picture quality and rela-
tively low concession prices, the Strand Theatre offers more than just new flicks

seating so you will never have to worry about obnoxiously tall people
sitting in from oryou. The seats are also very comfortable with high
backs and head rests, and the arms also Lift up for greater comrort.
Sound and picture quality were wicked good and the theater itself
has a cool style to it. It seems modern and has some art deco touches
that steer it away from generic mall theaters. The cnrire theater
manages to be clean and inviting lather than sterile. like many new
buildings.

Our only quibble was a slightly too loud projector for those to-
wards the back, but this was trivial compared to the genius who,
after receiving a call on his cell phone during the movie, continued
to answer it and have a conversation in the theater.

Now we have rhc option or three more than leasonably priced
