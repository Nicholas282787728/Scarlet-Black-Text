"You have to hand it to Grinnell”
says the Des Moines Register of 'thc
Grinnell Boy Scouts.

"When a big gang of 3011 red-blood

for n week there is generally one or
two hunches that stand out from all
the rest as being just a little above
[the average in conduct and spirit.
Such a hunch was the aggregation
from Grinnell at the state fair camp.

”No matter what little delay there
might be in mess, nor how long they
might have to sand in line, nor how
much they might have to work at the
grandstand, they did the job with a
smile. >
