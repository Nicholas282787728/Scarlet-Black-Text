Fritz Maytag: The aura is there
' Richard Letchinger

Fritz Maytag was in town last week for
the rededication of Burling Library. For
{our years I’ve been hearing a lot about
this man. He was the chairman of the Grinr
nell College Board of Trustees during

. some pretty exciting times, and I figured it
was about time we chat, so I arranged to
get 20 minutes of his time.

I sat down and looked through old
Scarlet and Blacks to try and figure out
what to talk with him about. I realized that
he’d been interviewed many times by the
Scarlet and Black So I felt it would be nice
to interview him on a different subject for '
a change,

When you first meet Mr. Maymg you are
instantly impressed by the presence he has
about him. There 'is just something
special, an aura if you will, that one can't
help but notice. Don‘t get me wrong, m
not trying to say that Fritz is a God m no,
only that he’s a man who appears to have
something backing up a firm handshake.
Basically, i like him.

Pulling him away from President
Drake‘s grasp, i promised to return Mr.
Maytag in time to enjoy what rm sure was
a scintillating Grinnell House quiche and
cookie lunch. As he sat down I noticed that
he was wearing suspenders. At first I was
a bit surprised; suspenders just didn’t
seem to match his aura, but as he started
to speak it all began to make sense. Mr.
Maytag’s speech is very deliberate,
almost like he‘s preaching a sermon. 1
mean no pejorative connotations by
employing that word though: instead. I
mean to tell you that Mr. Maytag presents
carefully thoughtout arguments in a very
concerned, yet authoritative tone. Sudden-
ly, suspenders seemed very appropriate.

50 what general topic did I choose to talk
about with this important man'! I think
what you would expect any graduating
senior to talk about 7 jobs.

“Mr. Maytag," I said, “let’s talk about
ﬁle business world. How’s the brewing
business these days?” (Maytag is the

president of Anchor Brewing Co, makers
of Anchor Steam beer.)

“I’m not in the brewing business " he
shot back, “I'm in my business."

“Huh,” was about the only response that
I could muster. Fortunately he continued,
and [think his insight is an interesting one.

“when you graduate from here you
shouldn't go into the business world, you
should go into your business world. The
real, real world is what‘s inside you; all
that you have inside you.

“Business is the most fabulous thing in
the world. It is exciting to go out and

Open letter to Lasko

Open letter to Bennett Lasko and his fellow
”Graffitiers”:

After reading bathroom walls for the
past 15 years of my life, I find it hard to
believe that you (Bennett) can View graf-
fiti as a respectable and intellectual
”means of expression and
communication,” But even with this point
cast aside, you must realize that writing on
bathroom walls is a form of vandalism
Therefore, though you may not think that
you are offending anybody, your act most
certainly is an offense to those whose job it
is to keep the walls clean, Do you scribble
over the bathroom walls in your own
home? {certainly hope not. What-rm say-
ing is that you cannot rationally argue that
graffiti is good when vandalism is involv-

ed. But- I come to make peace, not war, So I
have a proposal which should make boul
those who deplore “unblemised” walls and
the library staff (as well as the Ber men)
very happy. My idea comes from direct ex-
perience m this is what the authorities did
‘to .our bathroom walls in high school:
Cover the walls with paper, and then let
the,“gratfitiers" go to work. Both sides
win — you and your fellow “graifitiers”
get to express yourselves, and the 3&6
men are relieved of a tedious and stupid
job. I think that this proposal makes more
sense man a plea to Grinnell College to
allow vandalism. And remember, it is
easier to write on paper than it is on paint.
By the way, I too once got caught for
writing on the bathroom walls; I was in the
seventh grade. ~ Sincerely, Gregg Stone

discover that morality is not an abstract
idea, but something you deal with dozens
otrtimes everyday. I think many view we
business world as ugly and as some place
where you have to lower your sights, but it
is a wonderland where you deal with the
highest matters. It is a great tragedy that,
by definition, people in college don’t think
about putting liberal arts to work out there
in business."

“Good,” 1 said, “now you're getting a bit
more concrete for me. How do you feel the
liberal arts grad fares in the business
world?”

/

“A college grad has had to meet the
highest expectations,” Mr. Maytag
responded. “You need a high sense of imr
portance, and you have to have the ability
to be the best m this is something a college
grad has been told. Then there's an in-
evltable come down. But that initiation is
necessary, it is an archetypal activity in
society.

”A newcomer is purposely made to feel
unimportant, insignificant and put through
the wringer. But the old boys are looking at
the new kids and hoping that they'll sucr
ceed. Somebody notices who stands up and
says, ‘I don't know, but I’m willing to try,’
and somebody sees who gets there early
and leaves late, '

“But lt's all part of the initiation. The
old-timers are hoping that they [the new
employees] will do well 7 that‘s their
satisfaction."

“All right, hard work is one thing, but
where do we start," 1 asked.

“My advice? I‘d take the Horatio Alger
attitude. Small business, especially en-
trepreneurial small business, is one of the
great untold secrets. Also; [honestly think
that if 1 were graduating today I'd be
thinking that this is only my first job g
even if I told the guy who is hiring me that
I'm prepared to give my whole life to the
company."

So what is one to conclude from all of
this? Well, in one sense naming. Iofter this
(admittedly) philosophical conversation
with no conclusions;. read it on its face
value.

But in another sense 1 think Mr, Maytag
has much to say to liberal arts grads, As
far as I‘m concerned, a man who is in the
“real” business world helped to allay
some of my tears. It you want to believe
the gospel according to Fritz, our liberal
arts education and some hard word will
enable us to succeed in the wonderful
world of business.

That’s the first time anyone here has
every really admittedlhat fact.

From editor to editor

Dear Catherine. I understand that there
are certain pressures that go along with
your job of editor in chief, and I am
familiar with all of that stuff about life be
ing lonely at the top. Last week, however,
you sat down in your sanctum in the
newspaper office and tapped out on your
Smiﬂrcarona an editorial that I could not
in good conscience let pass unsmeared. I
refer, of course, to your priggish rantings
about the “inane and banal, usually
obscene and frequently malicious” graffiti
in Burling. .

It has been a policy of yours this
semester to elicit response to your
editorials from your humble underlings on
the editorial staff. Further, I must admit
any uncanny similarity of opinion between
us in the past when it came time to write
the editorial. Unfortunately, when you
solicited my editorial comment on your or
tering last week, I believe this humble
underling said someuiing to the effect of,
“‘%M$It%l And l've got dibs on space for
an adequate response to that trash!"

Thanks for finally giving me some
space.

There is something that- is primally
wonderful, something delightfully covert
about sneaking into a stall or standing in
front of a wall and scribbling one’s own
secret thoughts to share anonymously with
the rest of campus. The idea behind
writing graffiti is to convey a message or
to spread your own special brand of mirth.
Thus, graffiti is a means to an end;
seldom, if ever, is it an end in itself.

Not all graffiti is humorous or par
ticularly insightful Then again. not all
assigned reading is especially enlighten»
ing or brilliant.

You see, Catherine, this institution is
composed of a diversity of_folks, not all of
whom have wits or personalities that we

would want to be exposed to in large quan-
tities for a long period of time. Sometimes
these people scribble graffiti on hamroom
walls that we don't quite cotton to (hence,
a list of “ten biggest assholes on
campus").

Maybe graffiti tends sometimes to be
“essentially disrespectful," but having
one‘s character defamed in a toilet stall
certainly beats a malicious personal or a
bloody nose. You can always scribble out
bathroom graffiti.

To Say that a comment written in a toilet
smll is probably “better left unsaid” just
because of its location is an unfair, hasty
judgment. People who have a lot to say but
won’t write for the Scarlet and Black
(There are a lot of people who won't write
for the Scarlet and Black) will say their
peace in a Burling bathroom stall.

or course, at most, only half the campus
population will be able to see such
remarks, and the graffiti will appear
without the benefit of being edited. But I
contend that graffiti, especially if it is
discretely placed on a bathroom wall, of-
fers mose who see it some minimal enter-
tainment, if not enlightenment.

The anonymity offered by the four walls
around a toilet brings out a mischievous ins
stinct to do something naughty or foolish;
walls get written on as a result. Sometimes
the walls are smeared with visual gar-
bage, and that’s too bad. This should not,
however, be grounds to punish those who
use their study breaks to start a list of “ten
bestrlooking frosh” or produce a wacky
quote attributed to George Drake.

So you see, Catherine, there is a place
for graffiti, and it is in me bathrooms, in
Burling and in the Forum, at Grinnell. 7
Respectfully submitted, your loving news
