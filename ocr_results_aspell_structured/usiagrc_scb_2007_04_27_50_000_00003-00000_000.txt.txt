Yesterday. tllc trustees a ed on canipus

The tins es began their yisrtTinus-day at an

In addition to iicldin:Y continents

then own agenda. otparnt-ulat interest to run

could say to ,tutlents when they Conic here
that our commitment is that, within need, you
graduate with zero loans," college President
Russell Osgood said.

Under the proposed plan, the cap would
begin at around 57,000 and steadily decline
until the ultnrtare goal ofzcro loans is reached.
The trustees must also decidc how to incorpos
rate the plan into a new budget, but Osgood
did not foresee any pioblcms. “I'll be frankflie
said. “We can afford it.”

The board will also be approving degrees
for graduating seniors, awarding faculty with
tenured positions, voting on Phase ll of the
eonstruerion plans for the Darby Athletic Cens
ter and hosting a discussion on iinanceThtec
new tnistees are also likely to be approved.

This visit, like the 1 two thi at, lacks
the intrigue of previous y' [Sr While a tuition
bike was proposed, there was Little student
protest. The main student response, coordi-
nated by SGA President Chris Hall '07 was
a book called “Tuition Stories," which was

presented to the trustees. we wanted them
to hear the impact that it would have on us-
as individuals and on oui fainili '1 ts what
we thought was tht most constiuttive way of
going about it because they dour like to be
ycllcd at. They don't like to hear nothing but
pure otuplain

While the t. usttts still approved the tuition
liikc, (hi: college did implement some politics

Hall and Osgood stressed that the bestway
to elicit a response liom the trustee is “to he
thoughtful and approach them one-on-one.“lt
you approach it {out a way that 'oll'it: willing
to debate the . nts otwhaty u re presenting
on, iryou're willing to discuss it and 5in this is
what I’m doing, tlus is why," Hall sa' .

When planning last semesters response to
the tuition hikc, Hall said students lntCni’iOllT

proach,"l didn’t think that doing a protestwns
really going to do awhoie l0l.,rtll.\t itwe did so
that it was really going to deter them from u‘yr
ing to ehunge things fundamentally," he said.

Hall is still confident that it will be lni’el'T
csting and informative for both students and
trustees. “[The visit] should be good because
Ive met all of these people and [hEVVC got
interesting experiences, he said. They love
coming to these discussion lorums too, so it
should" be pretty cool'

KDIC listeners and said in
his email that Fuiuta is work

When askcd about the
future of KDIC, Fuiuta fclt

generally optimistic, explain-

ing that he thinks this year’s
radio shows are better than
last years. and he anticipates
implementing changes that
will make KDIC ii better star

Among them, Fuiuta linticr

STIFund considers past and present initiatives

 

STIFund .
that has been passed is

from ’7' 7 eligible. The commit-
tee is creating a database of all the successful
initiatives over the past 15 years. According
to Bishop, the committee must also decide
“between funding something signiﬁcant and
funding as mneh as possible."

Hall addcd another qualification for fund»
ing, asking, “Should we be paying our money
for something that the school should be pay-
ing for?"and noting that
when this is the case,
this may decrease the
likelihood of StiFund
spending money on
something like a Middle
East Studies concentrar
tion.

One criticism lev-
cled by students when
STIFund was initially
proposed was whether
the college administration would now feel less
responsibility to respond to student initiatives.

”/r [S l/Flmd] demonstrates [a
the budget committee that there
is a strong commitment.”

Vite-PresidenlforStudent Affairs

Previously, after student initiatives passed,
SGA would solicit the col-
logo for help in implementing
thcm..

Committee members sald
that SGA will still ask the
college for help and STIFund
will srrnply be used to expedite
implementation of the ll‘llllil’
tives. Smounkei Senatoi and
committee member Chris Hadc
’10 said that the nature of the
STIFund does not lend itself to
being a replacement for college
funding.

“There Is a limit on how
much we’ll fund each program,"
he said, meaning that complete
funding will have to come from
other sources,

College administrators re-
spontlerl positively to the STlr
Fund. “I think it’s a good way to demonstrate
self-governance,” said Vice President of SKUT

Tom Crady

”fliers b a l/lll/l to how much
we’ll fund each program.”

STIFund Committee member

dent Affairs Toni Cindy,

“It demonstrates to
the budget committee
that there is * tong mm,
mitmenr." An increase In
student emphasis on inie
tiatives, he said, “makes a
difference to us when we
look to prioritize things."

The STIFund Comr
mittee is working qurckly to fund some initia-
tives by the end of the year.

“The goal is deﬁnitely to finish by the
end of the semester." Hall said. “[But] bcfore
things are actually approved by Joint Board, it
will probably be three weeks."

Though it will be some time before any
moncy is distributed, the members oftlie com,
mirree seem arcited about the prospects of the
changes they can make this semester, and in
the future.

“I think we're all pretty thrilled we got a
lot of money to enact the strident will,” said

Hilde.
