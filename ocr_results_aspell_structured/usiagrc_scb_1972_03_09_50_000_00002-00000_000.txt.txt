The Scarlet and Black

The Doppelt Effect

The lib

by Jack Doppeit

The administration hasn’t been
cooperating. ii students want to
congregate at the library, Why can’t
the administration make the proper
arrangements?

Library takeovers aren’t as simple
as they seem, Youneed organization,
timing, manpower, and campus»wide
response. You know the adage, “what
if they had a takeover and nobody
came.”

The only successful takeovers are
those with proper planning. Ben-
jamin Franklin didn’t establish the
first public library for students to
argue about its takeover as the place
locked up for the night.

We need a better coordinating sys-
tem. First or all, reservations
should be made With Miss Dentel,
the activities counselor.

Can you imagine how ludicrous it
would be If the Associated Jewish
Students and the Concerned Black
Students commandeered the library
on the same day. We must avoid
these conflicts of interest.

The reservations should be listed
on the calendar and included in the
campus memo. This would afford
students the opportunity to join in
the takeover or at least stand out-
side the library and read the grie-
vances.

Movement

How can students understand what
the takeover was all about if it flew
by without previous warning? No one
believes the SdlB,

Next the organizaers could apply to
the Initiative Fund for finances for
the takeover. Every takeover ware
rants a distinct sum. The Initiative
Fund would never appropriate the
same amount iur a rearrangement oi
the 20th Century Room as it would
for a deluxe library seizure.

The library itseli needs reno-
vating:

(l) The glass door should be replaced
by a chalkboard to eliminate the
wasteful abundance of posters and
signs.

(2) A direct telephone line to the
President’s home should be in-
stalled. It could be Called ,Dialrae
Demand.

(3) Locks and chains should be avail»
able at the reserve desk. This, of
course, would limit the amount at
time they could be taken out.

I’ve been told that giving such ad-
vanced notice deieats the whole pur-
pose and effectiveness oia takeover.

I’ve also been told that the purpose
of taking over the library is to let
the college community know what
gross misiustices are being
committed.

i like my idea.

A Way Out Of Some Campus Problems

by Alan Bensley

Do you ever have the distinct teele
ing that the person you are talking to
is not listening to you” Or have you
noticed that many conversations nee
ver escape a certain level, perhaps
the intellectual discursive level, and
that you avoid really talking to other
people about some at the things that
are most important to you? ilave
you ever tell the trantic compulsion
to have iun, practically to devour the
weekend? Finally, do you sometimes
wonder how seriously questions like
these are asked? Members oithc
Revolving Door have been discussing
questions like these but with the
intention ol doing snmcihing about
them.

The very purpose of the Revolving
Door is to create an atmosphere or
situation in which people can be 115s

Two Pandas For Taiwan

by Edwin Debus
Last week we were treated not only
to the People's Liberation Army
Band playing our National Anthem
and Nixon proposing a toast to Mao,
but also the rather sensational and
misleading headline “Nixon to Pull
Out Troops From Taiwan”. The
Joint Communique stated that ”the
ultimate objective of the U.S. is

withdrawal (from Taiwan) “and
pledged that the us. will progres—
sively reduce its iorces and military
installations on Taiwan as tension in
the area diminishes". Rep. Scherle
oi Iowa, in response to Chou‘s pledge
to send two rare giant pandas to an
American 200, asked ifwe had traded
"two pandas for Taiwan".
it seems clear that Nixon’s pledge
to reduce troop levels in Taiwan is
- consistent with Nixon’s much bally-

booed “Nixon Doctrine" which has
as its central thesis that allies
should be chiefly responsible for
their own defense. Since the Viet»
nam war. U.S. forces on Taiwan
have increased trom 2,000 to 5,000.
and have yet to he reduced. it seems
that troop withdrawal of substantial
proportions is long overdue, and
one could speculate whether Nixon
has retained these troops solely tor
the purpose of a bargaining chip with
Chou.

What gains has the U.S. made
in “the Week that changed the
world?" It depends partly on where
U.S. interest may lie, but my list
would include; (I) Substantial ins
crease in bargaining power vis-ae
vis the USSR, (2) An exchange at
scholars, journalists, and athletes
» "peopleeto-people Contact, (3)1t
blow to the idea that China repre-
sents a Red Menace and therefore
must be contained, (4) A step to-
wards loosening China’s ties with
North Vietnam and ours with Taiwan,
(5) An impetus towards a negotiated
settlement of the Taiwan question,
(6) An increased awareness and
understanding oi' the Chinese people,
leading perhaps to seeing them as
individual people rather than as an
undifferentiated mass (it's a lot
harder to kill people than masses),
(7) Perhaps the beginning oiaperiod
oi diplomacy in which long range
geopolitical goals outweigh ideologir
cnl disputes.

An example ol the last point would
be the North Korean move toimprove
relations with the U.S. In a molar
foreign policy shitt they stated last
week that withdrawal of US. troops
need not preclude “expanding rela—

tions and an end to our conirontation
with the U.S.” Although this argu-
ment might be guilty or post hoc ergo
propter hoc, the North Koreans did
cite the tact that the us, precipi—
tated their action by agreeing to
Chou’s live principals specihcaily
regarding non intericrence in the
internal aliairs oi toreign countries.
It seems clear that the U.S. didn’t
exchange ”two pandas ior Taiwan,”
but received much in return tor its
long range pledge to withdraw irom
Taiwan.

portnnt to peoples' lives can be dis
cussed. Counselors at the Revolving
Door are essentially trained listen-
ers, not psychologists or psychias
trlsts. They are there because they
are concerned with peoples’ prob-
lems and have been trained in short
lerln counseling techniques. Besides
initial lrain' g sessions, there are
ongoing trai ng sessions ior mem—
bers which include such things as
rolcplaying, research, and training
lor dealing with bad drug reaction
cases.

On February 12 and 13, Drstewart
Shapiro, a clinical psychologist irom
the U,otCa1iiornia atSanta uarbara,
led a workshop tor eighteen Revolv-

practiced some sensitivity and one

This seems to be the year or the
detective movie. Dirty Harry and
The French connection have been
criticized as being too violent, but
both show a real understanding and
competent handling oi the cops and
robbers genre. The Eastwood-Siege]
combination in Dirty Harry has made
the better film; however, The French
Connection is n more polished pro—
duction. City locations. violence,
irustration, and action give both
lilms a fast pace and interesting plot.
Please note that the chase scene in
The French Connection has been
called the successor to Bullit, but
the car stunts are more exciting in
Diamonds nre Forever, the best
Bond nick since Goldfinger.

Troupe Shows Unique lalenl

by Sylvia Wallace

The Gl‘innell Theatre Dance Group
and Mime Troupe, under the direcA
tion of Mrs. B. Voertman, tickled
Grillnell's fancy March 3rd and 4th
with wistful dances and imaginative
mimes. The various theatrical ele-
ments which make a successiul pel‘r
formﬂnce combined to make this a
notable one.

The mood for the dances was set
by a soft, semici cular spotlight
surrounded by various colors. This
was the principle prop tor each 0i
the solos done by Deborah Jnii‘e, Sarr
:ih Donnelly, Mary rarrant, and Greg
Dickey to the music of Eric Suite.

The percussion piece, choreo-
graphed by Mrs, Vocrtman and done
to the drums of Daniel Barraiamos,
was impressive, In addition, mention
must be made of the last dance ens
tltled “Future shock” which was,
although not much oia shock, never-
theless unique. The musical score
for the number was written by a

to improve the Revolving Door. John

Morris, Grinnell psychology proe
lessor, is also scheduled to speak to
the staff about the question of idenr
tity crisis.

The activities of the Revolving Door
are certainly not coniined to its lo.
cation in the basement of Mears Hall.
Many of the stair members counsel
friends informally outside the Re
volving Door, and sometimes meme
bers go to students rooms lor bad
drug reaction cases and other prob
lems, More than this though, the
members have decided to have some
group discussions with students on
problems in interpersonal relations,
perhaps discussing questions like
the ones mentioned earlier. This is
all part of another basic concern of
Revolving Door, that, to help stue
dents learn how to deal with the
problems which arise between each
other.

Films To See Over Break

the swanesong of a Texas town in the
50’s doesn’t sound like much, direce
tor Peter Bogdauovich has done his
homework well enough to have put
together an excellent film. Director-
lal technique, especially pacing, is
the main attraction of Straw‘Dogs,
but I would not recommend this one
for general consumption. It is (liner
matlcally quite interesting, but it
tends to make the audience
physically ill with one of the most
lrightening sequences ever iilmed.
Unfortunately, I have not seen A
Clockwork Orange, but all sources
would indicate that it is a winner.
People have mentioned that the first
thirty minutes are hard to take, but
the remainder of the film more than
compensates, There are a iew new
releases to watch tor, including
The Go-Belween and The Godfather
which may turn out to be worthwhile.
. Also try to keep

in mind the Film Odyssey.
