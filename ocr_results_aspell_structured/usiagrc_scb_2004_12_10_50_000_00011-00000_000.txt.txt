Science for
the less-than-
scientiﬁc

Ever wondered what class

in Noyce is like? It’s not as
scary as you might imagine

The science gurus know that some people
would rather chew off their right arms than
take science classes, and they have planned
accordingly. There are some classes that are
designed speciﬁcally for non-science majors,
as well as intro courses that could appeal
to anyone, even those deathly allergic to
numbers.

Charles Cunningham, Physics, affectionately
known to some as ”The Grand Foobah," is
teaching a class called ”Physics in the Arts”
next semester.

According to Poobah, ”This course is in
tended primarily for students majoring in hu-
manities or social sciences who are interested
in gaining more insight into questions like
why violins and flutes sound different, how
lenses focus light rays in a camera and how
human senses respond to light and sound.”

This is the first semester that Poohbah will
teach the class, but he says he’s excited about
getting students with a variety of academic
backgrounds. ”I woutd expect it to be a lot of
fun,” he said.

An introductory course that may interest
many Grinnell students involves the plague of
the ladybeetles that hits campus almost every
year. In one section of Biology 150, "How the
ladybug Changed Her Spots," students will
study genetic van'ation and its causes.

Richard Preziosi, Biology, said "a good
example of this variability is that ladybug that
is so commonly seen in the autumn and has
most likely invaded your dorm."

While the class is intended to teach people
”how to ’do' biology," Preziosi thinks "an
appreciation or the magnitude and extent of
variation in the world around us would be as
valuable to the artist and philosopher as it is
to a biologist."

Another class that might interest the math
geek in the non-computationally inclined is CS
105, “An Algorithmic and Social Overview of
Computer Science."

This course will be taught by Henry Walker.
Computer Science, who wrote a textbook that
will be used in the class, he roo of computing.-
A Down-lo-Eorth Approach to Computer Fluency.

The course focuses primarily on the algor
rithmic principals and social implications of
computer programming, and includes studies
on ethics and problem solving. ‘

Non—science people have little reason to
fear courses like these. who knows, you might
even learn something interesting. It wouldn’t
be the first time that an innocent English
major was pulled into the seductive trap of a
mathematics major.

07:45 My aunt wakes me. I need
time to get ready and to get
packed up so that she can take
me from Madison, Wisconsin, to
nearby Stoughton, where ride»
giver Lara GaaslandrTatro ’045
awaits me.

07:50 Alarm goes off. Thank
goodness for that second line of
defense!

09:45 My aunt wakes me. In my
defense, this is the last lie-in I
will have for quite some time.

10:45 We cannot ﬁnd Lara's
farm. We pullinto a driveway
and call for directions.

10:55 After more driving, we
discover that we had in fact
called Lara from her own driver
way. I have forgotten my keys
and F-card in Madison. Oops.

11:30 Beloit! We are here to pick
up Chris Mayer ’07. I assist with
navigation by offering critiques
of local church architecture.

13:00 On the road in Illinois.
lara is doing all the driving.

To make up for this, Chris and
I provide entertainment by
reading Harry Potter out loud.
Finally, a chance to use my
Hagrid voice!

14:30 Lunch at the Brothers
Family Restaurant in Rapids
City, Illinois. The Reuben is
adequate.

15:30 The Hagrid voice is mak-
ing my throat hurt. I begin to
think that I should have offered
to read my copy of Bowling
Alone out loud instead.

17:00 Back in Grinnell. I call in
on floormate Sam Eckstut ’04.5
and offer advice on what to do
with his new ceiling hole.

17:10 I check my bag, and I
have my keys and Pocard after
all. Huzzah! This calls for a
celebration at Quad.

17:30 Dinner at Quad. I catch up
with friends. Much inappropri—
ate laughter.

19:00 Post-dinner procrastina—
tion hour.

20:00 Homework: international
relations theories and the Myt-
ilenian debates.

21:00 Rehearsal for Eliot Spen-
cer ’05’5 one-act. My throat still
hurts, and my chimp scream is
inhibited. My chimp capering,
however, is not.

22:30 "Homework” at the email
tables in Burling. This mostly
consists of writing my Day in
the Life and talking to friends.

23:30 Time to get some real
work done. I hunker down in
Boiling.

00:15 Okay, okay. Now it’s time
to get some work done.

00:30 I help brush Ross Koon
’06’5 teeth at the e-mail tables
in Burling. Homework follows.

03:00 Sleep overtakes nie.
