I think that a good use for the $2 million.
or at least for part of it, would be to invest
in solar energy research right, here at
Grinnell. Perhaps in the luture this could
even help to increase the college’s energy

Well. since no one has over accused me

1 have just learned of the death of Dick
Gilbert. Like everyone else who knew of
his tragic accident this summer, I had
built up hopes that he might somehow \vin
his fight and survive, As a friend of Dick's,
I am moved to new comment on his life.

Dick joined the cross country team as a
freshman when I was asenior. He was
immediately impressive, both tor his
abilities and for his friendliness and
maturity He seemed to like everyone, and
that leeling was mutual. l-le, as much as
anyone, was responsible tor the strong
goodwill that existed on the team that year
which made the season immensely en-
joyable. He was also intensely competitive

and strove to improve, which made the
season successlul. I suppose it was this
competitiveness which gave some hope
that he might be able to defeat the rivers
powering adversity

Events such as this tear at the very core
of a person. Philosophies of lite and
religions are ol little eomiort as strong
feelings/of anger, confusion, frustration
and sadness grip me. All who knew Dick
have sultered a great loss. No one was
ever more at a friend to me than Dick, and
l sorely miss him. I am thanktul to have
known him and tohave been touched by his
spirit and enthusiasm which will always
remain alive lor me. it s just not lair to
have to say good- bye so soon
