The Doppelt Effect

Another Weak Ot'Pun’ishmeni

by Jack Duppelt

Every piece oi literature concern—
ing the town or college oiorinnell
employs the saying, “go west, young
man" as Grinnell's earliest claim
to fame

However, only the {act that it
spouted irom the soothsaying tongue
of editor-politician l-lorace Greeley
to the responstve ears of Josiah B.
Grinnell has survived the annals of
history,

Even that has been disputed Leo
Rosten contends that “go west, young
man" first appeared in the Terre
Haute Express in 1851 as a Sugges-
tion by John L. Soule.

it it were the truly cataclysmic
prophesy that it has been made out
to be, Why haven't legends sprouted?
All the great Western pioneers, Davy
Crockett, Jim Bowie, Wyatt Earpand
Dudley Dooright are backed by tales
oi heroism, Where did J.B. go
wrong?

Legends are stories that snowball
with the passage of time. So I have
decided to get the ball rolling and
make J,B, a national hero, The
author or legends usually remains
anonymous. I feel assured that I will
tuliill that role during my life sol
have undertaken the task.

J B, Grinnell Hits the Road

In I854, alter a very hard winter,
not to mention a sore loser, lsaiah
Ground Hog, the famed radical cli-
matologist bucked the system and
reinsed to show up on February 2nd,
Horace Greeley, at the time a Cub
reporter tor a great metropolitan
nude paper, and his photographer,
Flash Cube, were on the scene for
the annual uncovering,

J. B. Grinilell was looming bee
hind a tree. He put aside his yarn
and watched the two reporters. You
can imagine the disappointment and
embarrassment oi the two journar
lists when they were seen gazing
at a gaping hole in the ground.
Sensing imminent disaster, the
mild»manner reporter yumped into
a nearby phone booth, took on his
everyday attire, and lept out oi the
phone booth...

Completely nakedi
There he stood, our mildrmanned
reporter, “not much to beheld“.

There he stood, a tigure striking
against the wrecked phone booth. He
fractured his right hand and swore

Plays Vary

by Roxanne Brown

How would you like your death and
also your reincarnation brought abs
out by machines » motion picture
machines at that! Well, that was
inst one oi the ieats Yvnn Goll ac-
' compllsiied with the help oi his main
character, Sebastian, in his play,
"The immortal One" which was
perlormed April 14 and 16th in Her-
rick Chapel

Alter the last perlormance the di-
rector, Steven Polkow, explained to
me that what Yvan Goll was essen»
tially trying to do was to familiar—
ize his audiences to the German Ex-
pressionism which was prevalent
around the 1920’s The play itseli
has no real theme other than the
combination oi the actors and ac-
tresses with the machines which
appeared both on and on the stage.

A a result, the collaboration oi all
oi the theaterlcnl techniques seems
ed to make the audience nonriunc-
tional it appeared to me that one
either totally understood the play
or not at all. it was certainly a
good thing that director Steve Pole
knw mini-med me that the role oi
the audience was to concentrate
on the play not to become involved
in it. So to all oi you who had the
spunk to view a play like this, don't
icel badly it you didn’t contribute
anything to it. Just be thankiul .
that wasn't your purpose,

by Sylvia Wallace

on Saturday, April 15, Concerned
Black Students otflClally opened
their Black Pi'ospective's Weekend.
One of the main attractions was a
play produced and directed liy none
other than Celestine Bloomfield
With echoes oi “Change, Nigger”
at the beginning at the play and age

he’d never strike that phone booth
again,

Flash Cube, taking things ﬁrmly
in hand, whispered to Greeley, "take
your glasses on, you’re making a
spectacle of yoursell.”

Getting down to business wholes
liog, Greeley peered into the hole
Lind saw the hog

“How are we going to get the
ground hog out oi there’” Greeley
asked,

“We can wait until our next meet
ing to bring it up,” the photographer
snapped

“But then some one will have to
make a motion," Greeley reminded.

“We can watch a soap opera it we
want emotion,” Said Flash.

With an inimitable nose for nudes,
Greeley tried to get a better View.

“Can’t anyone get any privacy
around here?" the Ground Hog
Squeeked.

”Not today, it's February 2nd,
You're late tor an appointment with
the underground press. We've been
waiting for you to disclose the spring
fashions, Ever since you started
predicting the weather reports,
we’ve come to you ior your pre-
dictions in fashion. There's no
money in weather," explained Gree—
ly.

“Not this year, You guys always
come around when you need me.
Where were you in the winter when
i needed acorns and berries; taking
your dirty pictures oi nudes on colr
lege campuses?” posed lsaiah.

“Now don’t get upset. You know how
we depend on you, You are the great-
est foreshadower In history,” come
plimented Greeley.

“Oh well. Just this last time. Get
your camera ready," The Ground
l-log said.

lsaiah Ground Hog emerged irom
his hole with the aplomb or a squirr
rel or possibly even that ofa beaver
en route to the damned.

Bulbs flashed. Flash blushed, He
had the memorable picture he
needed.

Suddenly, Greeley noticed a
peculiar thing about Isaiah's word-
robe. First of all, he Was clothed.
What was lsaiah Ground l-log doing
wearing clothes?

Greeley noticed that the outﬁt its
sell was quite odd.

In Impact

am at the end, the play depicted the
changes black- people have gone th-
rough during their evolution into
awareness. The chronological order
in which the scenes exemplified the
way black people have moved for
ward over the years and yet have
gone absolutely nowhere was very
eiiectlve,

The content oi the play included a
Tap Dance scene, a Plantation Scene,
a Poetry Scene, 3 Church Scene, a
Nephertitl Scene, and a scene (19*
picting a burglar's onetime interr
change with a minister

One scene in particular which
showed a coherence oi theatrical
elements was the poetry scene in
which the lights were dimmed, blown
out, and illuminated to iit the Vans
ous moods oi the poems being We
cited. Another interesting scene
was the Nephertiti Scene, telling the
tale oi the conversion at a white
minded black revolutionary bv the
Airican Queen, Nephertiti.

As tar as the cast ct characters
goes, each at the characters were
superb in their roles. The cast
includes. Diane Jones, Milton Rol-
land, Sybille Scott, Renee Weldon,
Onishous Jones, Patricia Swansey,
Barbara Critton, James Gates, J c,
Smith, Sheial Scullock, Linda Cope-
land, and Elliott Lewis. Extra iine
perlormances were given by Milton
Rolland in the role oi the Baptist
minister and Onishous Jones in the
role oi the burglar who relieves a
minister ot some oi his hiirdens and
at the some time gives him a bapr
tism into awareness. My hat goes
on to each oi the actors ior their
one perlormances, And to celes-
tine I say RIGHT on, sister, that
message about the black experie
once was ON THE CASE””!!

"What was that supposed to be?
There are no sleeves to that and no
collar,” Greeley perceived

”This is the outfit of the coming
season,” the Ground Hog asserted.

“What are you trying to tell me,"
Greeley asked conlusedly

"Don't you get it. Invest in vests,"
lsaiah slyly commented.

"What the hell is that supposed to
mean?” Greeley asked impatiently

“Are you ready now'7 What I’m
about to tell you will he of historical
significance, Here it ls-—CiO VESTS,
YOUNG MAN.”

With that, J B, Grinnell, who was
still observing from behind the tree,
ran off with what he thought was the
Cinch to revolutionize the iashion
industry,

Legends will never be the some.

Current BundsnMusic 0r Message?

by Scott Mason

Lovesong is one or the many bands

periorming today that is tr ing to
sell a message with its musi . Like
The Children at Time and The
Chicago Women's Liberation Band
at past weeks, Love song’s perr
iorming emphasis is on a subject
that is not primarily musical in
scope. To my mind, the quality oi
the music in all three cases has
suffered.

Musically, Love Song was Camper
tent, though less than exciting, The
hand has a quiet, country-rock ﬂavor
that resembles the New Riders of
the Purple Sage, yet lacks the rhy-
thmic drive supplied by the New
Riders’ drummer. Using acoustic
and electric guitars, piano and
bass, Love Song presented a tight,
il‘ listless, sound The three and
(our part vocal harmonies were
impressive, yet failed to rescue a
sound that was basically commer
cial and unrinventive. in spite oi
a tew Garciarinfluenced pedal steel
phrases by the lead guitarist, Love

Song lacked the energetic solo work
and rhythmic drive that is the basis
oi most line rock bands,

Much the same problem plagued
the Chicago Women's Liberation
Rock Band. Even with two drums
mers, the band wasn't able to pull
the songs on the ground, and the
solo work was uninspiring, to say
the least Even though the lyrics
and vocal work were interesting,
the overall sound was reminiscent
of the band that played in a garage
down the alley in eighth grade The
Women’s Band was certainly limited
by the iact that their keyboard play—
er was stranded in Chicago; how-
ever, their failure to develop any.
thing oi substantial musicallnterest
indicated a lack oi creative energy
that I look for in any band.

The Children oi Time, a Baha'i
group, presented a program that was
much broader in scope than either
oi the other bands but was plagued
by inconsistencies in the quality of
the material. The program opened
promisingly with a piece that fear
tured tine visual material and bean-

tiiul improVised local lines by two
singers. The second number tea-
tured some competent Jazz trumpet
from the group’s leader, Warren
Kine, yet ended with a chorus re-
mlniscent of the final act of “Up With
People,” The Skits and readings that
followed were on a level much less
sophisticated than that of the first
musical number. This contrast gave
the concert a very uneven quality,
preventing the group from achieving
a total success.

My position in dealing with all three
oi these groups has been that era
musical critic; Ihave no complaints
concerning either the sincerity or
the message at any of them. It is
high time the women played an active
role in rock, and I wish more relig‘
ious groups would express theirbe-
liefs in active contemporary forms.
However, I dislike lack of musical
integrity in any manner. Music is a
medium that is fully able to speak
ior itself, those who use it to pre»
sent a non—musical message Should
use it with respect or not at all,

New Directions In Russian: Needs Expand

by Carolyn Ashbaugh

About twenty Russian studies and
Russian language students met with
Russian professors Randell Magee
and Dennis Whelan recently to dis-
cuss the nature and direction of the
Russian program at Grinnell. First
and foremost in the minds of those
present was the pressing need tor-tin
additional man in the department.
Without a third man, the plans for a
comprehensive Russian program
and the needs of students currently
enrolled in Russian courses can
not be IulIllled,

Discussion at iirst iocused upon
what Professor Whelan views as
the three possible Job descriptions
tor a man in Russian were money
for an additional salary to he foi‘th~
coming. The alternatives appeared
to be i) a language specialist (or
Slavic Linguist), 2) a literature sper
cialist and a) a person with strong
language background plus concen»
tratlon in cultural or social history,
Students and proicssors discus—
sed the alternatives and expressed
strong support tor the iirst option
..a Slavic linguist.

Insepai'able from the discus
slon oi the major Interest of the
hypothetical third man was the
discussion of the direction in which
the Russian program should move
in the iirst case, a language spe-
cialist would have a more tech-
nicul knowledge of the Russian lung-
uage than has either Mr Wheli’in
or Mr. Magee Such Li person would
be able to work more closely with
advanced students in dealing with
problems oi syntax and stylistics
He would have a sound background
in the development and structure of
the Russian language and would
bring this expertise tottie study or
Russian at Gl‘innell An additional
man with technical lunguagc back
ground would strengthen the lang-
uage aspect of the Russian pro—
gram,

Never tar ii-oni unyone’s thought

DENNIS WHELAN

was the knowledge that an additional
man in any or the three areas would
relieve some oi the pressures on
Messr. Magee and Whelan and would
make the Russian department more
capable or serving the needs and
interests or its students With an
idditional man, Ml, Whelan envl~
sions a language program in which
all three (and perhaps tour) years
oi language would be teamstzlught.
l-le reels teamrteacliing to be es
pecially important in language, be-
cause it gives students the opporr
tunity to hear more than one pro-
ililfiClCttlLi. ‘ same time With
the Russian language especially,
students need to be able to sit down
with their instructor and work on
pronunciation and points oigrammar
individually, Mr. Magee currently
has All students enrolled in first
year Russian alone--a figure which
rellects the inadequacy oi the stat-
iing in the Russian department.
The second suggested direction ens
tails the addition oi a man in liter
rature. Tins suggestion was quickly

rejected by the group DI Students
present, because they felt Such a
person would overlap extensively
with Mr. Wheian and might not of-
ter the desired sophistication in
the language.

The third alternativena person
with strong language background
but with a special interest in the
cultural or 506131 history of Russia
would be a very viable possibility
if the department opted to move in
the direction of Russian Studies,
Mr. Whelan remarked that one can»
not always assume that ii a per-
son is interested in the language
of a country that he necessarily is
interested in its literature. Feel»
ing among those present was in Ia»
vor of the speciﬁc improvement of
the language program. Other ex-
pertlse an additional man might have
would be secondary to his language
interest and ability. A Combina-
tion of a linguist and cultural hiss
torian would be almost impossible
to tind according to Mr. Wheian
The attempt at long-range plan-
ning in the Russian department
seems indicative of a new Critical
atmosphere which this writer sen~
ses on campus, in a period oi
financial squeeze, students and fa-
ctilty alike are asking for direction
to their programs. They are ask—
lng, “Why is money being spent
in this area and not in this?"
“Is this the kind of program; is this
the kind of school which We really
want or towards which Vie should
be moving?" A more Critical at
tempt to put expenditures in the
Context of the budget as a whole
seems to be under way Untortue
nately, the Russian department's
planning hinges entirely upon the
expansion of the department. With-
out all liiui‘edsed staff, the most the
department can do is hold its own.
With two very committed taculty
members now and with interest in
Russian courses alid in Russian
studies increasing, this need must
be met.
