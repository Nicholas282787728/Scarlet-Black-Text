Classes May Be Cancelled Nov. 7

by Mike Breed

The Joint Board recommendedthis
week that Classes at Grinnell be
cancelled on election day, Novem-
ber 7. The action, takenattheweekv
ly meeting last Wednesday night,
is a recommendation only--theproA
posal must passtthxecuuveCounr
cil and the taculty at large beicre
it is oﬁicial. Themoveis designedto
allow Students Wholive nearGrinnell
to travel to their homes to vote.
Jerry Miranowski, student Demo»
cratic campiagn worker whoorigl-
noted the proposal, also hopes that
the anticipated passge oi the re.
solution by the faculty will encour-
age students to participate in elec—
tion day political activities and will
emphasize the importance of the
upcoming election

Although no speciiic mechanism
was supported by the Joint Boards
to accomplish the cancellation of
classes without missing actual class
days it has been suggested that the
mid-semester break be moved up
a week so that election day would
be included in the break.

Also taken up at the meeting was
the issue of the Student Auditor’s
oiiice, which has been a source
of controversy since the beginning
of the school year.

In an 5&3 interview Wednesday
morning Michelle Conway, the Stu»
dent Auditor, explained her role in
the controversy and also tried to
define what she though the role of
the auditor should be. Following the
resignation oi Loren Hart, who was
Assistant Auditor last year and was
to be Auditor this year, Ms. Conway
was appointed Auditor. This made
her the first Auditor in recent SGA
history, she explained, who had not
had the experience oi being Assis-
tant Auditor iorthe preceeding year.

SGA, through the FinanceCommit-
tee, was at the same time calling
for a tighter control on the SGA bud-
get anti a more accurate accounting

at where the money went. This put
the Auditor into a role of deciding
on what policies her office would use
to control the money, andit wasthese
policies which became the center of
controversy.

The most recent issue hasbeenthe
reimbursement policy, The Audie
tor's office, after consultation with
Donald Lambie, the college trea»
surer, had decided not to give re-
imbursements on receipts submitted
for events which had already
occurred, This would help to pre-
vent halls from purchasingalcoholic
beverages with activity hind money
and would prevent the alledgedly
widespread practice or submitting
ialsiiied receipts,

Taking issue with this, the Joint
Boards passed a proposal by Mary
Damsgaard and Lynn Lichtenberger
to instruct the Auditor’s office to
issue reimbursements, and also to
bring any iurther policy decisions
to the Joint Boards. Many House
preside‘nts expressed the opinion
that a policy of no reimbursements
would cramp the social style oitheir
halls.

Ms. Conway told the Joint Board
that she would like to View her role
as that of a bookkeeper, and as long
as Clear policy instructions are
given her by the treasurer oisoA
(the Chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee) she will follow them. It is
her opinion that the Auditor’s office
should be automonous and that the
Auditor’s salary should Come from
the Office oi the College Treasurer
rather than from SGA.

John potts, however, expressedthe
opinion that SGA should retain a
closer control of their bookkeeper
by having Control over the Auditor's
salary. other house presidents
seemed to hold this same opinion.
In other SGA action, Russ Mace
Gregor, SGA President, presented

Demo Campaign Gathers Steam

by Fred Horecky

Grinnell students active in the
local McGovern for President came
paign have recently announced a
series of fund raising and canvas»
Sing activities on the campus and in
the town, as part at the statewide
McGovern campaign.

The most pressing activity at the
McGovern organization at this time,
according to workers, is the can—
vassing. The purpose of canvassing
is to determine who the potential
Democratic voters are, and to get
them to vote. Canvassing activi—
ties are presently taking place in
various cities and campuses around
the state, and have already been
conducted by Grinnell students in
Marshalltawn, Ottumwa and Cedar
Rapids.

The group plans to conduct a door—

passed into law even though his name

well be attributed to Ed Mezvinsky
as well as some others that were
there helping."

“I think I did more in my two
years’ time to move a political
process into the twentieth century
and into the area oi lobbyists and
consumer protection and environ
mental control than maybe any
freshman that had been there for
some time,"

Mezvinsky also addressed the
question of the financing of Song

be outspent two or three to one,”
he said; “the incumbent will have a
lot of advantages we have lo face ”
The Congressman is using his $130,

SGA As A‘Sounding Board’

by John pieiier

As evidenced by recent questions raised by the son, KDIC, and seve
eral members oi the college community, there appears to he a general
misunderstanding as to what the SGA cabinet percieves the student
Government Association duties to be and how the student Government
Association should function, This article is not intended to beare~
buttal to any oi those statements or inquires, but rather a clarification
oi my own perspective on what the student GovernmentAssociat‘ion does
and why it should be there.

Most obvious is the tact that the Jam Board serves as a iocalpoint
ior student interest and ideas, in previous years there wasastudent
Senate as well as a Council oi House presidents and the Associated
Women Student's--an overall organizational setup that empirically lended
itself to a great dichotomy oi iunction and purpose. This was an extremely
meiiicient and contusing system, whereby one was not sure where cer-
tain concerns should be voiced, and more importantly it was a system
that invited duplication and an overlap oi interests, as well as a situ-
ation in which issues were lost in the bureaucracy, or worse, issues
were not raised at all,

Through the abolishment oi the Senate, and the redeiinition oithec
oi HP and the Aws, the son organization was streamlined, or consoli-
dated, into one general body whose responsibility lies with all iacets
of student interest--social and academic, (Allecampus EPC student
members are now a part oi the Joint Board )

Amplifying this responsibility, I view the SGA as beinga "sounding
board“ we as students would be atn loss to 1):issess student sentiment.
2) act on campus issues according to expressed student attitudes, and a)
channel student energies so that students could have a say in the gov
ernance oi the entire community.

Were we to relinquish this responsibility, we as students would be
asking the iaculty and administration to be loally responsible [or our
actions, and we would become totally dependent on them {or the govern.
ance oi our social and academic lives; I hardly think that anyonewould
sincerely entertain such a regressive action
Thus, son provides an active student tnrnm tor the presentation and
elucidation of issues relevant to the College. 0! both a social and
academic nature, that cannot be iound elsewhere on this campus.

The Committee A structure, along with increased student roles on
studenlriaculty committees and the Educational policy Committees. was
borne out or a student movement bent on increasing student input on all
levels oi the college community students how have .i voice on eirh oi
