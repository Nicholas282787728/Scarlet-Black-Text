Journalists" Roasting Session Dinner
Has But Short History on Campus

Razzing and i'oastillg' are old
stuff on the Crinnell Campus, but
the annual dinner devoted to that
pastime is comparatively new.
Sigma Delta Chi, professional jour-
nalism fraternity, sponsored the
first dinner on Nov. 17, 1933, as
part of the Homecoming plagl'um.

Roastvmaster for that razz han-
quct was the late Henry W. Mate
lack, professor of organ. A tour
page razz sheet and shits on cam-
pus life were featured.

“Stumbles Backward”

There was no roasting session

the next year. "Grinnell stumbles

Backward" was the theme of the’

dinner on Friday the 13th, 1935.
Skits were in the nature of blacle
outs, satirizing the faculty and
students.

The roasting session Feb. 24 is
the first one to be held Jointly by

Sigma Delta Chi and Theta Sigma
Phi, national honorary and pl'ofeSr
sional fraternity for women in
journalism.

Impersonations

This year’s roasting session Will
feature impersonations of campus
characters, ooth faculty members
and students. A razz sheet will be
distributed at the dinnero accord—
ing to present plans. Work of writ-
ing the skits has begun, and stu-
dents with suggestions are invited
to get in touch with any member
of Theta Sigma Phi or Sigma Detr
[ta Chi.

The dinner Will be modelled after
the national newspapcrmen’s grid-
'iton dinner held each year at
Washington, D. C. In place of skits
on national affairs, the Grinncll
roasting session will feature slrits
on campus life,
