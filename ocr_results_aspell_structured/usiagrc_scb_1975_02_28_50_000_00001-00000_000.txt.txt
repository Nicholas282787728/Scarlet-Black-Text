Apply Er

with the application deadline
sertly approaching [or oft-campus
programs iiirst semester rail '75
and the academic year "15176)
there have been a number of
questions raised about the means
oi applying, the quality oi the
programs, in addition to the means
or applying, acquiring iniormation
on these programs

The person in charge at all off-
campus programming is the
Register, Mr. Seller. who generally
reviews all applications tor
academic leaves.

There are three means of getting
oIl»campus for academic reasons
The lirst is through a college
sponsored program. which means
any oi the programs listed in the
college catalogue, the second,
through a group organization or
consortium. This latter type might
be a program oiiered by a group
such as the Experiment in Ina
ternational Living, or a similar
student geared organization. The
final means is for the student to
arrange independent enrollment
in a college or university, either
with or without the aid of Grinnell
College.

Mr. Seller noted that last year
there was a student who wrote to
the university he wanted to attend,
received all the necessary in-
iormation, sent out his application,
got accepted, and only then saw
Mr. Seller to have his leave ap
proved, Although this is not usually
the way it is done, it is nonetheless
a viable alternative. In fact, the
method oi individual application,
etc , shows an important quality to
the committee that considers oii-
campus leaves, being the intensity
of the students interest in the
subject matter to be studied oii-
campus.

Next to this in importance in the
overall approach to taking a
semester or year away are the
Dlans that the student has. ”I can’t
stress enough the importance or
planning ahead,” Mr, Seller said,
This gives the student a chance to
acquire adequate preparation ior
the courses that will be taken and
the general experience of being at
another school, in particular, a
school in a loreign country, where
the ideal preparation is not only in
the language, but also in history,
and culture coupled with the
student's maturity an ability to
handle the new environment,”

At the outset, there are a number
oi people the interested student can
speak to, The best qualitied person
is Mr. Seller. He has a directory
which describe a number of
programs, broken down into many
areas oi interest. He can also give
a number of suggestions based on
reports he has received by students
who have gone in the past

The student may also speak to
his or her advisor \\ho should be
aware oi a number oi programs
which lhe department has received
inioriiialinn about, Many oi these
are not alii _ altered. so iliat an
titlrisor or more or in the
department oi the student‘s in

terest may be able to make
suggestions that Mr. Seller would
be otherwise unaware of

Once the student has decided on
a program, there are two ways to
follow this up. For an affiliated
program (those listed in the
college catalogue), the student
shollld see the Campus adviser for
that program They have the ape
plications and can provide a iair
amount of additional information
on the program, while also being
able to suggest preparations,

rora non-aiiiliated program, the
student should first see Mr. Seller
who will provide addresses, etc, He
will also be able to give the student
an idea oi the ciiicacy of pursuing
Study at the particular college

Not all applications ior off-
campus study are approved,
although most. are. ”Chances are
good ior approval ioi academic
leavet ii the student can point to
adequate preparation. “Mr. Seller
said, continuing. one should “think
ahead enough so that they can
choose courses and independents
to provide this adequate
preparation. We are interested in
the student having a maximum
intellectual experience.”

it a student is well prepared, the
only reason an application ior
academic leave would be turned
down, would be it the quality of the
program were questionable. in this
case, the OffeCampus Study Board
will make suggestions oi possible
alternatives in the student’s field of
interest, In order for this to be
effective. though, the student must
apply well cnough in advance or
Grinnell's deadline and those of the
individual programs

Ellective Fall '75, a student with
iinancial aid can apply the amount
designated toofl‘ecampus studyoia
year or either semester.
Previously, one could only use
financial aid for the first semester
oia year program or only ior a tall
semester program.

Once a program is cleared and
the student accepted, he or she
receives a formal letter of cone
firmalion from the Registrar
which Specifies the program, its
duration, means or evaluating
credits for transfer, and a note on
preparation tor return to Grinnell
at the end oi the program. it there
are changes to be made in the
program’s content or duration, the
student should “keep in touch”
with the School, especially Mr.
Seller to ensure that such changes
are approved and coniirmed.

As ci-innellsponsored programs
save the student the anxiety oi
having the program itseli ap
proved, there are some new
Grinnell programs oi interest
being planned. The iirst, which has
already been announced is

Election

runoff
today

in moderate voting Wednesday,
no candidate for SGA president
received the necessary majority
necessitating today's runoii
election between Will Collins and
John Lem,

Collins led the balloting Wed-
nesday With 43.6 per cent oi the
vote lollowcd by Lem who gar-
nered 23,3 per cent of the votes.
Totals for the individual can-
didates are below, The writeins
were led by Jeff Miller with 30
votes

The turnout ior the election was
587. well under half the student
body, but higher than last year's
vote oi 548.

A constitutional amendment.
also on the ballot, establishing only
one SGA vice president was
adopted by a vote of87.6 per cent in
favor. Previous cabinets have
consisted oi two vice presidents oi
either sex. John Hanson, current
SGA president. stated that enough
work exists to occupy two vice
prcsidents. but the work was not
easily divided between two per-
sons, The elimination of one vice
president also reduces the amount
oi salary going to the SGA cabinet,

All the candidates were disape
pointed with the turnout though not
surprised. Freeman had cam-
paigned on the idea oi getting at
least 800 persons to vote

“1 hope that as a result oi my
Campaign,” Freeman commented,
“that people w realize that to
improve the social life you have to
be concerned with the academic
nature of the sehool,”

Blanchard explained the low
turnout with the feeling that
“people think that SGA isn’t worth
shit and it is probably because SGA
has not done much in the past,”

Will Collins

Collins, leading the balloting, felt
that there weren’t “any reasons
why there shouldn’t be a 85-90 per
cent turnout.” Collins had hoped to
obtain 50 per cent on the first ballot
but wasn't surprised that he didn't
due to the large number or can-

Trailing Collins substantially in
the Wednesday voting, Loni
commented that “realistically, it
doesn’t look too good, but lam not
going to roll over and play dead."
“I would hope that my six hundred
of the students would come out and
vote Friday."

John Lom

Some of the candidates com-
plained about the poorly organized
open iorums held Monday and
Tuesday stating that the campus
was unaware oI them Those few
students that attended, candidates
commented, did not go looking for
a candidate, bllt were committed
to a candidate prior to the iorum.
The forums were attended by
approximately 40 people all told.

The election went smoothly
Wednesday despite the resignation
of David Berkley, SGA election
board chairman, late Monday
evening. A dispute developed
between Berkley and the SGA
cabinet over who was responsible
ior conducting the election

Berkley felt that he “had been
misled many times” by the SGA
cabinet and resigned on those
grounds. Disagreement seemed to
center on the distribution of
literature and the location of
campaign posters in the post oiiice
on the day of the election.
Berkley's position was that no
literature and posters should be
allowed.

The election Wednesday was
conducted by the SGA cabinet and
according to'Hansen “the election
is being conducted precisely the
way he (Berkley) prescribed."
Hansen felt that the resignation
two days prior to the election was
“the single most irresponsible act
on the part oi a student that i have
seen in three years."

The SGA cabinet is conducting
the runoll election, but is looking
ior a temporary election chairman
to conduct the remainder of the
SGA elections,
