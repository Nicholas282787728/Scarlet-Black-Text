Midwest eonlerenee basketball
tray tonight against Ripon col-
lege in Darby gymnasium. This
game will be followed by 21n—
other,home contest, this one
ye us Lawreneo to be played
tomol'l’oii' lllghl.

Iii Huron the Pioneers will
tat-e what eoaeh John Plitseh
deseribes as a "strong. seasoned
ball club." The ltodmeri have
eight returning letter-men, one
or whom, Pete Kasson, ranked
in the top 20 scorers in the eon-
lerenee last year with 12.4 points
per game. They have losL only
one starter trom last year's
team, which tinished with a 5711
mark in the eonierenee race,
They ﬁgure to be stronger on de-
fame and in the rebounding do~
partnient, though Kasson is r

, pllted to be the only l'C'Jl 560

mg thruzll. Ripon also has 21 new
eoaeh. Kermit "Doc" Weiske, an
allelillm great 31 that school.
Luwrenee is a team looking
tor a good year otter three
lean ones that have seen the
Vikings win only two league

game Last ye ell] they were
1—15 in the eonlerenee. Things
are looking up this season,
though, with live outstand:
ing sophomores coming up
tram last year‘s lreshrnan
team. Senior letter-winner
Bill Weber and tour sopho-
mores wil probably start lor
the vikings with Joe Lnrncrs
and .lim Rasmussen being tab—

bed as newcomers m varsity
play who can score and have
the height to rebound.

0n Gr‘tnriell's side or the fence
Coach Pillseh seemed pleased
by the indivrdual development
his squad was showing to shoot-
ing and other skills, and not at
all displeased over the tact that
he was having trouble putting
the finger on any five men who
stood out over the rest, He' list<
ed McChntock and McCullough,
Simmons and Moses, Lowry and
Collis, Grotclusehen and Kantz-
ler, Copeland and World as all
being possible starters in any or
the three. games this week. He
made it very clear that the
