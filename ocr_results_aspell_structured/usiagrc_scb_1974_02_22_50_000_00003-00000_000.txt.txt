Editor’s Note: The health services
provided by the college have long
been criticized by many Grinnell
students. In Spite of the question-
able validity oi‘ their complaints,
in the words oi one student, “Pe-
ople have tended In shy away irom
the Health Center.” in this story,
which is the iirst in a three part

Younker Memorial Health Center
has been a part oi the Grinnell
College Campus ior 17 years. Its
purpose: to provide certain limited
medical services and to act as an
advisory agent to help the student

1 with his health problems in

e most efficient way available.

In 1942. the college received a
large endowment irom the Younker
iamily, with the section providing
for a health center stipulating that
“...until $75,000 is on hand, and
until finally expended, shall be kept
and known as the ‘Hospital Fund’
with this sum a hospital shall be
built and equipped ior the use of
the students and personnel oi the

ouegef'

onald Lambie, Vice President

(or Business, said that this state
ment, which is part oi a document
entitled “Agreements with the V107
unher Family,” poses “a tightlegal
restriction upon the use oi the
Health Center building to only those
services associated with a hos-
pital.” Any use or any part at the
building must be of a “healthrre»
lated nature,” he said. This has
been tried and upheld in a test case
in court.

.The iunctions oi the Health Cen—
ter ”for the use of students and
personnel of Grinnell College,” have
not, however. been fully explored.
Students’ fees form the source‘ of
the center‘s operating budget. The
services provided for these iees
include the dispensing oi nonrpres-
cription medicines like triaminicin,
infirmary and overnight care, re-
ferral to other health services in
the community, some emotional and

‘ealth related countelling and a
,etndent insurance policy.

Treatment at college personnel
(faculty and staff) so far has been
minimal and usually' in the iorm oi
inﬂuenza vaccines. The establish-
ment of these services with the ex-
clusion of such services as pres-
cription medication, laboratory and

_———

clinical diagnostic work, an on-cam-
pus doctor, or birth control ser—
vices have been the result of con-
ventions which developed during the
center's history.

These conventions seemingly came
about because of the Center’s staff's
professional limitations and per~
sonal natures. The iourstai'f mem~
bers are all Registered Nurses.
This type oi staii has limited the
services which can be offered. By
law, [this may only periorm minor
diagnoses and treatments without
the specific advice of a doctor.

Other limitations are of a perSOr
hal nature. For example, Irma Hall,
Administrative supervisorhasmade
it her personal practice to reier
patients to doctors for most types
of diagnoses. Although there are,
she said, ”quite a few cases in
which I would be able to second
guess a doctor and be perfectly
right, i would rather not run the
risk oi making a wrong diagnosis."

This is not a required policy at
the Health Center. Where one nurse
may use her own discretion and
give advice to a patient; another
might reier the patient elsewhere.
However, Hall has been associated
with the health service for 18 years
and thus her policies have become
more or less ingrained into the
operating procedures.

still, these procedures are seem-
lngly greatly dependentuponthe per—
sonalities of the staiiinvolved. Last
year (172473), the three nurses
working with Hall were all Roman
Catholics (one was a nun); birth
control advice was not prevalent
and Hall attributed the lack 01' ads
vice to this characteristic of her
staff. This year, however, thereare
two new staff members and accord-
ing to Hall, the limitations on birth
control advice should not be as se—
vere. At the moment, there are no
statistics to confirm or refute this
statement.

‘When the center began operation,
it was felt that it should remain
open 24 hours per day. This re-
quired a staff or four persons, sta—
ggered around three shifts. In add-
ition to the four RN’s, Irma Hall,
Marie Durr, Karen Davis, andShir—
ley Mathis, there are iour student
assistants including Grace Cam-
eron, Gita Modak, Cheryl Pickard

' and Maura Zwerling. Their duties

include assisting the nurses, taking
care oi patients, and some recep-
tionist work. Along with the staff.
there is a salaried physician, Dr.
Ferguson, who acts as the Medical

19,7344 Health Center Budget

The budget centersaroundthe needs
of the nursing staff. The following
is a brief summary otwhatservices
are provided from this budget.

' Student labor

The budget at 31500 is slightly
exaggerated. According to one of
the student assistants, none of them
make more than $300 a year.

Supplies

Thls supplies the money for medi—
cations supplies by the Health Cen-
ter. There has been a general in—
crease ih this amount over the last
five years but there is a more re
cent decrease of $300, down from
last year. Medicines are costing
more, but the decrease was made
possible due to an otisetting der
cline in expenditures. One source
oi savings has been a substantial
drop in the number of inﬂuenza
vaccines since 1968 whichrunabout
$1 a shot. Additional savings have
arisen irom the increasing reduc.
tion in the use oftheHealthCenter’s
services and consequentlessening oi
the amount of medications given
out, The supplies budget, according
to Hall, is directly reﬂective of
medicinal costs. when asked if the
present Health Center could make
use of an increase in the supplies
budget Hall said, “No, we are
spenduig all that we can. You see,
we can’t spend any more since that
would have to go {or services (such
as prescribing medicines) which we
can't ofier.”

Miscellaneous

This portion oi the budget is mini-
mal and the services itencompasses
are similarly small. These include
such things as laundry, daily main-
tenance, and phones. No money
exists in this section for lab tests
or other clinical-diagnostic work.
Such services are not provided at
the Center, but on an out-patient
basis at Grinnell General Hospital.
Such expenses, when they are met,
come under the area of the student
insurance policy.

Insurance

According toCollege budget iigures
supplies by Walker, thestudentheas
1th insurance costs rose abruptly
in the ’697’70 school year by a
total of $3,349.anincreaseof25.5%.
(see table), Lambie has explained
this increase as a result of a very
sudden rise in the number ofclaims
and the amount oi money collected
on these claims during the '69970
school year.

This was especially evident re-
garding claims made under the athr
letic policy. These went from 72 to
179 in just one year. Figures ior
the same time period as compiled
by the RamseyWeeks Agency,agents
{or the college health insurance, do

. not directly correspond to those

listed in the college budget. of the
two sets oi iigures, those provided
by the insurance company are more
accurate than the college budget
which merely anticipates expendi-
tures. The former set of statistics
indicates the exact amount received
in premiums. For the '72-’73 year

these ligures show an increase of
$6,754 or 39.3%over the amound
paid in 53/59. During the same
time of this increase-the amount
of money paid out by the insurance
company on claims actually de-
creased $563.32. The resultoithese
two trends is seen in the loss ratio
column which indicates the percent
return oi premium monies on in-
surance claims. This ratio has dr—
opped quite substantially irom95.5%
to 55.9% in the time period under
study.

According to Lambie, this drop
was apparently intentional, Prior
in 1970,, the health‘insurance po»
licy had been. running around an
85% to 95% loss ratio. Then, a
sudden spurt Of claims at the end
of the ’69/‘70 school year escalated
the amount oi money paid out for
claims to such levels that ”the
insurance company threatened to
pull out."

A new policy was negotiated based
on a deductible format. Suchapolicy
is supposed to cut down on thenum—
ber of Claimsalloweth would make
the policy holder pay all costs the
curred below a certain number of
dollars. it seems that the introduc‘
tion of this deductible health insurr
ance policy has lowered the amount

' paid out in claims since its adop-

tion in the fall 0f1970.

Both Walker and Lambie, who are
involved iii a reevaluation of the
current insurance program, have
not yet been able to justify the
low return rate beyond a simple
“Well, you must understand that a
company cannot survive without

-mahing a reasonable profit,” acc.

ordlng to Lambie. The question is
by no means resolved and the col.
lege is continuing to make queries
into the matter. ‘

The current policy is based on a
mandatory iee oi $15 per student
and provtde 5 minimal coverage.
Lambie explained that the manda-
tory nature at the policy lowers
the individual premium paid by each
student.

The amount of coverage provided
,varies with the type oi medical
problem. There is a $500 limit on
what the policy terms “the aggre—
gate expenses incurred as
the result of any one acciden "
This included transportation and
ambulance expenses. Thesame limit
is applied to dental care, excluding
x»rays. For "sickness” the insur»
ance will pay at most $12 a day
for 30 days of hospital room and
board expenses and up to $100
ior additional expenses. Surgical
fees up to $150 will be paid for
such things as removal of the kid
ney or cutting into the cranial cave
ity. The policy will only pay a perr
centage bl this $150 for other sur»
gery such as amputations oi thighs,

‘need. The college

breasts, legs, lingers and toes,
surgery for varicose veins and the
removal oi eyeballs.

The policy only covers accidents
and hospitalized illnesses. It does
not cover any visit to a doctor for
an illness or ior advice or ior any»
thing not related to an accident.
Thus birth control is implicitly
excluded from any coverage.

Expiicitly not covered are "sen
vices rendered or me'dical suppllies
provided by the school infirmary.”
Nor are illnesses resulting from
“preventive medicines" or "preg-
nancy, childbirth, or miscarriage"
paid ior. One additional exclusion
is payments for any “loss caused
or resulting irom the use at any
drug or agent classified as nar-
cotic, hallucinogenic” pscholytic,
psychedelic unless administered
by a qualified and licensed phyv
siciah.”

Walker stated that the Life insure
ance Company of North America,
underwriters of this policy, have
structured it for an average Student
is currently
searching ior possible alternatives
to this policy that might either be
less expensive for the student or
that might proVide coverage just
ior accidents and injuries common
to students

Although this policy may betailorr
ed {or the average student’s needs,
the average student does not seem
to be making use of the facilities.
available: The number at people
using the Health Center has dec-
reased over the past five years.
Although enrollment has increased
steadily throughout the live year
period, the number oi recorded
oiiice visits has dropped substan—
tially. (see table 3) The average
number of visits per student has
dropped ircm 5.7% in '53-'59 to
4.2% in '72-’73 (see graph below).

According to Hall, this trend oi
a decreasing usage rate 01 the hols
lege health services has continued
into this school year (these statis-
tics were not available as of 5515
deadline).

There has been a 36.4% decrease
in the number of Visits recorded
per student. Similardropshavebeen
recorded in the number oi Health
Center in-patients (a person who
makes use of the center's bed faci-
lities), in the number of doctor re-
ferrals, and in the number of hos-
pital referrals. In checking with
Grutnell General Hospital, it was
learned that no student is admitted
or treated there without first being
referred by the college Health Cen-
ter.

As Irma Hall noted. “I will be the
first to admit that we (the Health
Center) are increasingly suiiering
from a iornl oi isolation and sep-
aration from the normal living pat- -
terns oI'the college.“
