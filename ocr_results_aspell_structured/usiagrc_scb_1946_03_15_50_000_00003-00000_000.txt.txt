"Emperor" Drama

m, in ARI-I auditorium. Kent An-
drews, assistant professor in drar

matic art and director of the

set and script,

Filming of the production, to

'nounced for the weeks preceding

of difficulties with lighting equip-
inent.

An original adaptation of Hans
Christian Andersen's The Emper-
or's New Clothes provides the
script for the satirical farce. The
all-girl cast will wear half-masks
in the manner of last spring’s
Pierre Pateliii. Action of the
play centers around a vain em-
peror, portrayed by Barbara Mc-
Conihe, Langan freshman, and

rogues, played by Ann Reddan,
Cleveland freshman; and Janie

youth, gave the number impact.

Peter and the Wolf, a child's
story set to music, represented
each character in the story with
a musical theme as well as dance
interpretation. This selection
seemed to laclt in the dancing
the childish exuberance felt in
the music.

Rhapsody In Blue depicted four
toy dolls, three of whom are
jitterbugs, the fourth a ballerina,
who come to life. The clash in
provided the most
spontaneous performance of the
evening and gave a humorous
twist to Gershwin's use of modern
jazz in semirclasswal music.

Warsaw Concerto, which pre-
sented the entire class in finale.
portrayed the futile struggle of
Poland against the engulfing
Nazi hordes. The use of con-
ventional ballet to represent a
desperately embattled nation and
the lack of balance between solo
and ~chorus ltept this selection
from unity of theme.
