CONGRA TULA TIONS to an Grinnellians‘

on your Century of Outstanding Achievements....

Our best wishes to the students, faculty and alumni of Grinnell on the conclusion
of another outstanding scholastic year symbolized in the 1946 Centennial Com-

mencement exercises. May Success accompany each of you in your many and var-'
ied endeavors.

Through the production of fine printing, we have had some part in, Grinnell
promotional activities during‘ past years. Here in Marshalltown we have an institution
—larger than most of its kind‘ in central Iowa—where

EXPERIENCE
FINE CRAFTSMANSHIP
AND DEPENDBABILITY

.
are at the disposal of all who are in need of good printing in one or more of its var-

ious forms. >

The value of experience, fine craftsmanship, and dependability can seldom be
measured in coin of the realm, but they combine to determine the ever apparent dif-
ference between superior and mediocre results. We are proud of the production
standards we have established and intend to maintain.
