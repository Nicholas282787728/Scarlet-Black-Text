Damage Causes
Gallery Closing

by Don nagenais

Schaeffer Art Gallery exhibitions
will likely be cancelled for the re-
mainder oi the year following Sev~
eral acts of vandalism which took
place at the Gallery last weekend,
according to Louis Zirkle, Assoik
iate Professor of Art and Direc»
tor of the Gallery.

“It looks like the whole exhibi-
tion schedule will be canceled,"
Zirkle said, “and future exhibitions
are probably not likely. This is the
worst vandalism we have ever had.
It appears to be methodical and
intentional.’ ’

Although the Gallery has from time
to time been plagued with occasion~
iii acts oi vandalism and stealing,
this is the first time a Show has
been withdrawn for those reasons.

Last weekend’s damage involved
five paintings by Grafton Boehner
of the Art Department. Two of the
paintings were punctured as if by
a pencil, one was creased badly,
and two others had firm thumb
prints which had broken the paint.

Following discovery of the vandal»

Ellen Yacknin and John Potts were
victors Wednesday in the runoff e],
ections for SGA viceePresidents.
The two both won narrow victories
after surviving the first round of
elections Monday,

Wednesday's runoff was particu-

ism early Monday morning by Zir»
kle and Art Professor Richard Cer-
vene, the show was removed.

As a result of the damage the Gal-
lery’s insurance protection will
likely be restricted. Although the
college itseli is on a $5007deducts
ible policy, the Gallery has in the
past been covered under a special
rider for losses below that amount.
Following the recent damage, how-
ever, Zitkle anticipates that the
Gallery will be.placed on the $500-
deductible plan as well.

“Even if that wasn’t the case, I
still don't think we have any right L
to put works there," said Zirkle,
“it’s foolish. There’s just no se-
curity, since the building is open
from 7:00 in the morning until 12:00
at night.”

One show which will likely be
canceled is the popular student ex-
hibition, which was scheduled for
April 30 through March 15, In pre-
vious years the exhibition has not
experienced a great deal of vandal-
ism, “but this year we just can’t
ask the students to do it," said
Zirkle.

The Gallery, which has featured
works of guest artists as well as
members of the Grinnell faculty,
has been in operation since the Fine T0131 VD‘ES

Three positions have developed irum the Executive Council’s proposal
to disestahlish the Communications department by 1974. Basically the
Council’s statement argues that a Communications department does not
fit into the list of the College’s priorities, that the department would need
considerable funds if retained and naturally expanded, that the department
is weak, and that the opportune time has arrived to kill it since twu ui
three iaculty are retiring.

The Concerned Communications Students‘ position, expressed in their
evaluation of the department, states explicitly that they wish to revitalize
the existing department without any increase in the present tacuity posi-
tions or budget.

The third position, voiced by the Student Government Association.
questions the list of priorities the Council used to make its recom-
mendation since this list has never been publicly revealed, and also
the whole “disestablishment” process.

The debate began back in June when Mr. Herbert Prescott announced
his retirement from his position as a Professor of Communications.
Coupled with Ms. Velma Hiser's retirement in 1972, the department
was leit with only Mr. William Vanderpool, Mr. Prescott‘s position
was iilled for one year by Ms. Patricia Kent, with renewal dependmg
on the department’s future. Ms. Riser is teaching partitin'le this year
so that her students in speech pathology may finish out their majors.

Over the summer, student Curt Gorrell conceived of the idea for tile
majors to voluntarily evaluate the current department since it was
in an opportune state of iiux. Gorrell, as the student representative
to the Educational Policies Committee, could then present the re
suits to the Committee for action.

in September the majors met and decided to act on Gorrell’s suggeSs
lion. When Gorrell mentioned the evaluation to Dean Wall, Gorl'ell was
told that such a report might be used, and that it should be compler
ted by November or December.

Yacknin, Potts Win V- P Races

noted that he wishes to thank ever-
yone who gave him his support and
he hopes that he can jusiiiy the con-
fidence lhat students have placed
in him. Although he declined to make
statements outlining speciiic plans,
saying that he preferred to confer
with the rest of the cabinet before
doing so, Potts did emphasize that
student participation and support oi
SSA is very important and that “we
can’t do it alone...SGA is a student
enterprise and student support is
integral lo the success of student
government.”

Potts also invites the entire cam~
pus to a victory celebration in the
South Lounge at 9:00 pm. Saturday

H"! In Jeopardy

by John Wylie
i LITE (the Iowa Library information Teletype Exchange) the program
which allows orinnellians to get lnterlibrary loans or material not in the
Burling collection, is in serious jeopardy because of recent federal budget
cuts proposed by the Nixon Administration.
According to the program’s director, Shiela Schaumburg, the agency‘s
entire $45,000 per year budget comes under Title 111 oi the Library
Services and Constructiun Act oi 1955. The proposed budget ior fiscal
1974 would eliminate the LSCA entirely.

And, according to the staii oi Iowa s senator Dick Clark, preliminary
drafts oi the President s Revenue Sharing Program specifically prohibits
use oi revenue sharing funds for interlibrary loan programs

l-ler immediate priorities are to
clearly define the functions of the
Educational Policy Committees and
to institute programs within the
dormitories which involve both fac-
ulty and students.

Student cooperation is especially
important during the spring, she
noted, in order that SGA may eval—
uate social iunctiuns, the Resident

Adviser system, and academics at
Grinnell.

EPC Studies Independents

by Steve Nunn

The all»campus EPC is considering
a set of proposals to set guidelines
for independent projects.

The guidelines, which define thety»
pes oi independent study options a—
vailable and the procedures iorget-
ting signed up ior them, are to pro—
vide better planning and advising for
independents and to credit faculty
ior projects they supervise, the
committee says.

According to John Kleinschmidt,,
professor of French and an EPC me-
mber, “They are an attempt to ra-
tionalize an unmanageable situa-
tion.”

Aiter being put in ﬁnal form, the
guidelines Will be sent to lhe face
ulty.

According to outgoing SGA vice
president Anne Walter, “There

should be an opportunity ior the
whole campus to discuss the pro—
posals” before the faculty receives
them, and they may be sent to the
divisional EPCs for comment as
Well.

The guidelines divide independent
work into three categories. Indepen-
dents at the BOO—level are defined
as in-depth research projectswhich
result in a paper, a musical com-
position, an artifact or some other
”proof of achievement that could be
examined and judged by other pro-
fessionals in addition to the faculty
director” of the project. These in-
dependents could not be used for ex-
ploratory or preliminary work but
would have to focus on an area
where the student had already ace

Despite the planned cutback of
LSCA funds, the program is not dead
yet. Its funding was scheduled to
expire Wednesday, but Congress
passed a continuing resolution which
allows continued funding forthe pro-
gram through the end of this fiscal
year (June so).

The future of LSCA after that time
is uncertain, and depends largely
on Congress’s action on the entire
Revenue Sharing Program. There
has been speculation in Washington
that Congress would extend the cur-
rent education programs, of which
LSCA is a part, through fiscal 1974
using another continuing resolution,
to allow more thorough study of the
revenue sharing structure.

Senator Clark’s office quotes of-
flcials at the Bureau of Library
Programs as saying that inter»lib—
rary cooperation programs like I-
LlTE are both popular and success-
iul, "giving taxpayers a high return
for their dollars."

Ms. Schaumburg noted that, ii the
program is cut off from Federal
funding, there is still hope from the
state legislature. The Regional Li -
rary Systems Act, currently in com-
mittee, would provide some iunding
for I-LITE, although at lower levels
than the program's current budget.

She explained that, iithe billpasses
in its present form and LSCA funds
are cut off, l~LlTE would continue
but the member libraries would have
to begin paying their ownwa mes-
sage charges ior communications
within the l-LlTE network- a bill
that could run well over $100 mon-
thly at each library.

However. she expressed confidence
that the program was important en—
ough to the member libraries that
they would continue as members
despite the added cost.

But, under reduced iunding, it would
be impossible to attract the state's

Hecliinger Calls For Reordered Priorities

by John Wylie

Higher education in this country
today is in deep trouble because it
has lost public interest, according
to Fred Hechinger, Education Edie
tor of the New York Times.

l-lechinger, who spent Monday and

Tuesday on the oriunell campus vis-
iting with students, faculty, and ad»
ministrators, spoke at a public lec-
lure Monday night in Herrick Chapel.
“Higher education today is in
very deep trouble because, for the
first time in thirty years. there is
no general public agreement that the
universities are iuliilling a neces
sary national purpose,” iiechinger
stated.

He added that, “for the first time
the United States government, which
in the past always helped the uni—
versilies and the colleges to make
their case to the American people
is not making their case at all,
and is in not playing down the need
for higher education,"

In his public address, iiechinger
stressed the need for colleges and

universities to iinri a common grs
ound on which to build their pros
grams, and the problem posed by
the lack of shared experiences in
today’s civilization.

Sesame Street

He noted that small children are
probably the only members of to—
day’s society who have a national
shared experience - “that great
miracle of modern times, Sesame
Street." Hechinger commented the
at the series’ Cookie Monster is
as familiar to children in Calif-
ornia as it is to those in New
liork. “They’re sharing something,
and they’re probably among the few
people in our current civilization
who are sharing anything."

At a news conference earlierMonr
day, Hechinger had noted that hens
ceforth colleges and universllles
will have to do the job of selling
their worth to the general public
on their own , and that they should
have plenty of evidence available
for making their case.

“The Colleges must find ways to
