Should SGA concern itself with national issues?

' by Raffael Stein

Recently the Grinnell College Student
Government Association has been inun-
dated with resolutions of a political nature.
The question that iigures in the minds of
many .loint Board representative and in-
terested students is whether it is the func-
tion, duty, or even right of the sea to
vote on such issues.

Before I try to answer this question, I
would like to analyze the stated functions
of the S.G.A. and relate them to what ac-
tually occurs, Article II of the constitution
explains that “the object of this society
shall be to allocate student funds, en-
courage student debate, solicit student 0in
nion and in general to address me needs of
students." Whereas the Grinnell College
Catalog (1983734) feels that “the primary
aim of SGA. is to include every student in
the process of responsible selt
governance.”

With regard to the constitution, it is

about the subject.‘ I may seem rather
apathetic toward War because I feel there
is no serious threat of nuclear holocaust.
As men and women, our basic instinct is to
survive; whether we are Russians, MexV
icans, Cubians, Canadians, Americans, or
any other nationality. A world war would
threaten the survival or all, thus, as ra»
tionai beings who wish to live, the pro-
bability of an all out war is fairly small.
However, I’d like to add that I am an op
timist, concerned that the probability of
War exists at all, and that inherent in that
probability there is the danger or war, and
that danger is what we should be concern»
ed with.

But now is not the time to focus on war
and petty international conflicts and dif-
ferences that do not concern us. We are all
on the brink of a new age and we should be
preparing ourselves lor it. Generally
speaking, in the 1600’s people were bound
and dependent upon the church. Then they
became bound to the state and their “3.
tion. Currently, the people are becoming
increasingly dependent upon technology
and computers. I need not go into the
details of science other than two important
aspects, We are all becoming more and
more dependent upon other human beings
tor the production of goods and services,
regardless of their nationality. Alsn,
technology is helping to close the barriers
of communication which existed between
nations. Thus, the importance of the “8.
tion is decreasing. Along these same
historical lines, prior to the coming age.
we. as Americans, were obsessed with ex-
pansion, marked by the necessity or larger
tactories, the success of a year as
measured by percent change GNP, and the
existence of the never ending exploitation
of natural resources, However, people are
now beginning to realize a state of

clear that the lirst function 7 that of
allocating the Student Activity Fee — is
iultilled. In fact, the s G.A. has a reputa-
tion among many students as being solely
”a money handling organization,"

In terms of “encouraging student
debate,” we have recently witnessed the
distribution or the Parslow proposal to the
entire student body and the resulting Cur-
riculum Questionnaire. In terms or en-
couraging political debate, however, it is
limited by and large to the Political Activi-
ty Support Fund's financing or politically
active groups.

Solicitation of student opinion has
received more emphasis recently. This is
due, in part, to the new rules enacted last
year which require all in reps to write
and post the minutes of all meetings. This
year many a proposal has been postponed
in order to allow J.B. reps the opportunity
to consult with members at their consti~

equilibrium, with close to zero expansion,
must be established before we literally
drown in our waste. Thus, the area to be, in
a sense expanded upon, is techology. Ad-
vances made forward in technology are
not so much to prove the superiority at
America, but to better the human condis
tion, world wide, In this way, I now idenr
tify myselt f|rst as a human being, second
as an American.

As for the pol' cians who feel that we
Americans need to stick our noses in the
affairs of other countries, I feel ﬂiey are cl-
inging to the ideals of a dying age. The
world will also come to a political
equilibrium without our help, given time,
Indeed, I am not advocating passivity,
apathy, or ignorance, rather leadership.
The time has come for America to stop
babysitting and to start setting an example
by limiting our use ot nuclear power to
power plants until an alternative power
source becomes economically feasible. In»
stead of ‘building up' our nuclear arms we
should take initiative and put down our
‘busy-body interfering arms, This move
itself would decrease the chance of world
war. Then we could confidently begin
preparing for the coming age, — Sincere-

tuencies. Whether or not they actually do
refer questions to their constituents and
represent their views is hard to tell.

The fourth function, that of addressing
the needs of the students in general, must
be used as the theoretical basis for
establishing the appropriateness of make
ing statements of a political nature,

I believe that in making statemenm
about issues that clearly affect the
students, the S.G.A. is addraﬁing the
needs oi the students, A recent example of
this is the condemnation of the Solomon
Amendment, a public law whose effect has
been the denial of money in the form of
loans to certain Grinnell students.

However, it is not such a clear cut case
with the proposed condemnation oi us, in-
volvement in Central America. I imagine
that it could be forcibly argued by many a
Grinnellian that this sort of increased
military activity might bring about the
draft, thereby directly affecting a substan-
tial number of students. However, many of
us would have an enormous problem ac-
cepting this argument, The point or this ex-
ample is to Show that certain difficulties
might arise in determining which issues
affect students and which do not. Thus, I
feel that only in cases where it is unques
tionable that students are affected Should
the s.G,A, take the initiative in proposing
some sort of action,

When me S.G.A. does indeed act on cers
tain issues, it should back these
statements with certain actions, such as
sending letters to relevant officials and let»
ting our views be known to students in
other colleges. This is one of the purposes
of the newly formed Committee on Student
Politics. These actions are necessary, in
my opinion, in order for the work or the
S.G.A 7 acting in behalf of the general in-

terests of the students 7 to have any air

feet,

It must be clearly pointed out mat the
new committee institutionalizes the pro-
cess of submitting statements for Joint
Board approval but it does not legitimize
it. Although a statement has recently been
approved. and S.G.A. Vice-President Pete
Hautzinger feels that “it is entirely ap-

'proprlate tor the SGA to represent

students' political views," the debate is not
over. In tact, the major purpose of this are
ticle is to initiate a debate on U115 issue
which will result In the formulation of a
policy that will be adhered to in the future,

My proposal. that of limited and
qualified S,G.A. involvement in the
political arena, does not mean that the
S.G,A. should ignore the other issuﬁ.
Rather, it should set the ioundation tor opi-
nions to be voiced by the students. In other
words, the S.G.A , in lullilling its other
functions, should set the stage for debate.
For example, it could hold weekly Open
Forums, topics of which would be careful-
ly chosen in order to reﬂect a cross section
of political beliefs on campus.

In a small community such as Grinnell,
certain forms of ‘pure democracy' are
possible. A perfect and feasible example of
this would be student referendums 0n the
debated issue, It is obvious that not every
issue should be subjected to a referendum,
and that only when certain requirements
(similar to those needed to hold a referen-
dum on the constitution of the S.G,A., such
as acquiring 15 percent of the student body
or 2/3 vote of J.B.) are fulfilled should such
a move be taken.

The point of this is to reduce reliance on
our representative system of government
in the determination of such issues. None
of us want to see the day when students
running for office (J.B,) advocate a
political stance that overshadow: the plat
forms of fiscal responsiblity and ‘self-
governance.’ .

We should realize that participation in
the S,G.A. is an educational experience
just like many other lorms or extra-
curricular activities. However, when
numerous political statements are made
without a set guide, the S.G.A, is taking on
a new, responSlbility that Carries with it
dangerous implications. We must not only
give serious consideration to every case or
issue that comes before Joint Board, but
we must also keep in mind the precedents
that we set and how they will reﬂect upon
the student body in the present and in the
