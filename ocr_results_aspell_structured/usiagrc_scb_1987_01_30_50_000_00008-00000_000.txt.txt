Trading Places

by Brian Strause

TRADING PLACES should be placed on
a higher pedestal than its predecessor. the
cheap 5howrmersOme-skin-andrtalkrrealr
dirty-to-me teen-age comedy. Certainly.
TRADING PLACES is sprinkled with the
feces that allows box office receipts to
grow. but such gags are not relied on for
this film's basis of humor. Sex is used
tastefully, despite the importance of
Ophelia the prostitute (Jamie Lee Curtis)
as a major character. Jamie Lee Curtis
exposes her mammary glands. in all their
glory. but once; and in this one scene, she
emerges as a sex symbol with which to be
reckoned Curtis’ voluptuous body Combinr
ed with her ability to scream. as
demonstrated in HALLOWEEN, form
merely the base of our heroine's multi-
faceted acting gilt. Her acting prowess is
best viewed in a scene in which she is paid
to approach Louis Winthorpe in man

This performancerwithinail-performance
was executed beautifully. as though she
were acting out an everyday occurrence.
It is an injustice that Curtis’s name did not
appear on the marquee.

Apparently. Dan Aykroyd and Eddie
Murphy are considered the true stars oi
this iilm, They initially appear as distinct
ly contrasting characters. but soon they
find they are both pawns in a sick game in
stigated by Mortimer and Randolph Duke.

Contract

‘by Bruce Emond

Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi has'

garnered praise and awards for his skillful
direction. Zanussl’s CONTRACT. the sc-
L‘ond film In an Eastern European film
series. details the gradual disintegration
oi a wedding party as guests bicker and
slight each other.

CONTRACT is set in contemporary
Poland and the characters are members of
the wealthy bourgeois. Although the film is
a comedy and somewhat reminiscent of
Robert Altman's THE WEDDING
‘Zimussl credits Altman's work for pro-
viding inspirationl. there are Serious
undertones As the party progresses, the

characters reveal their decadence. i‘rom'

the host itho perSISleiitly cheats on his wife

Valentine is reminiscent of his inner-
ghetto skits on “Samrday Night Live.” We
iirst meet Billy Ray when he attempts to
hustle the-fine people oi Philadelphia by
pretending to be a blind and legless Viet
nam veteran, Perhaps this operation
would have been more successful had Billy
Ray retrained irom actively pursuing
iemale passersby (“Once you have a man
with no legs. you never go back“).

As a result of Mortimer‘s bet with Ranr
dolph on the age-old question oi heredity
Versus environment. Billy Ray finds
himseli in a highrpaying job. owner of a
luxurious townhouse. and master of a
chauffeur. In the meantime. Louis Wins
thorpe III is in jail ior allegedly dealing
PCP. At this point. Billy Ray and Louis
have etiectively traded places. Billy Bay
has taken to his job well. while Louis
festers in despair 7 imagine ialling from
Exeter and Harvard to an existence in
which gnawing on an unidentilied iish mats
ted with hair from a Santa Claus costume
is considered a treat

As Billy Ray lights up in the company
bathroom. the Dukes unknowingly inform
him that his entire change In lifestyle was
an experiment. Louis and Billy Ray Subse-
quently team up to orchestrate the
downfall of the ljuke brothers. How they
achieve this goal provides the necessary
twists to elevate this movie to greatness
Any film that can throw a villain in a
homosexual love affair with a gorilla and
seem reasonable in doing so deserves a
spot in everyone's weekend plans.

Kagemusha .

by Kevin OIPrey

In KAGEMUSHA, Akira Kurosawa's
iirst iilm aiter a ten~year hiatus irom
directing, the great Japanese director cone
tinues his work in a tradition that has
created classics such as THE SEVEN
SAMURAI and, more recently. RAN.
Perhaps one oi the greatest film directors
of the twentieth century, Kurosawa
depicts his critical view at the human ex-
perience through tales of samurai in
feudal Japan,

KAGEMUSHA is the story of a pathetic
thiei. condemned to death, whose life is
spared when it is discovered that he bears
a striking resemblance to the local war
lord. The thief is iorced to act as a decoy
tor the warlord in public appearances,
When the warlord is killed, however. his
death is concealed and the impostor takes
his place in order to tool the enemy. The

ruse fails In the end, and the Impostor is
humiliated, put out, and eventually ialls in
a massacre oi his lord’s army.

Kurosawa‘s iorte is his use of grand
compositions to depict human nature. Like
John Ford in the American cinema.
Kurosawa explores nobility. humility,
sacrifice. and pathos in humankind
through its behavior in war His canvas
often ignores the Individual Characters for
the greater ballad of the battle. AS with his
other greats, KAGEMUSHA shows
Kurosawa's brilliant skill in manipulating
great masses oi men and horses,

Few directors can convey the sweep oi
human passions with the intensity of this
master. His use of sound. tracking camera
shots. and the rhythm oi galloping horses
are mesmerizing Kurosawa is a tilm
maker whose films should never be miss
ed.
