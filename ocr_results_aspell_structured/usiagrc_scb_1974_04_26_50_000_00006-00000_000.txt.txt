Woods Explains SGA Role

by M). Woods

The problem with...being sawsch-
olar~politico on this campus is that
you will unvaryingly become a pot--
itico—scholar. This problem pains
me greatly as l have the intention
of studying sometime next semes-
ter. This, combined with my nat-
ural proclivities, towards eating,
sleeping, and my occasional trips
to the Pub, will be highly prohibi-
tive to the Swift completion at my
appointed rounds. Actually lhave
always wondered how scholar-poli-
ticos managed to do it; maintaina
reasonable grade point average in
between meetings, conferences and
PDR’s. Thank God l’ll never find
out. The Office of Student Coordin-
ator will go through God-awful am-
ounts of flux this semester. I, per-
sonally, have no intention of making
SGA a full—time job,

First, how about office hours? Sc-
rupulous tallys will be kept as to
the number of visits received dur-
ing thses periods, and if the num—
her is excessively low I will dis-
establish office hours, publish my
personal phone number and keep
”room hours." I consider this 2r-
rangement to be better, or at least
more comfortable than the old met-
hod OI futile waiting,

Second, standing meetings with the

Cornell: One Step
Closer to Presidency

MOUNT VERNON, IA—-Cornell
College has moved one Step closer
to filling its vacant President’s job.

Cornell‘s studentnewspaper--The
Cornellian -- reported lastweekthat
the student / (acuity / administra-
tion Presidential Search Committee
has completed its work and has for-
worded a list of three candidates to
the Cornell Board of Trustees for a
final decision.

Sources at Cornell said that the
Trustees would probably hold a spe-
cial meeting to vote onva new tires
ident __ but there was no official
confirmation of this

Grinneil College Executive Vice-
President and Dean or the College
Waldo s. Walker is among the can-
didates for the top post atCornell—-
which has been vac-ant since the
resignation last summer of Presi-
dent. Samuel Enoch Stumnr.

Administration? Not on your lift-3.
i am sure Messrs. Leggettahdwal-
ker will have better things to do
than sit around and listen to my
idiot questions, and I am even more
sure that l have more important
things to do than wait {or answers.
Besides, it has been my experi-
ence that when somethingislormal-
ized and ritualized, it loses its
original meaning. What happens
when a week goes by and nothing of
any consequence occurs? You sit
around and talk about the weather
with a Dean who could be doing
something of importance. This is
further complicated by the fact that
people, when they have formed a
relationship based on certain r0165,
tend to stick to those rules even
in times of emergency. How seri-
ously can you negotiate with a per-
son with whom just a week before
you’d discuss hockey scores? I be-
lieve that if I have no standing ap-
pointment with said ge ntle men, when
they do receive the pleasure of my
company, they will know there is a
serious question on my mind and
we can get immediately to the ser-
ious business of solving it.

By the same logic, the WDods Re-
port will only be sent toS Awhen
the Student Coordinator! ls that
SGA needs to know something. That
way the Woods Report will become

something to be noticed, rather
than the same garbage each week.

Further, the Student Coordinator
has over the years developed ahap-
py prediliction tor ignoring things
that do not deserve his attention.
All surveys from other colleges,
Governance Magazines, and l‘how-
to-rule-your-campus" type stuff
will find itself ruthlessly, vindic—
tively, and happily forwarded to
the nearest trash drum,

ln moent years, SGA has become
a full time job. As i am not paid
enough by SGA to work afull time
(that is, not without having my
sense of Worth offended) l intend to
work SGA as if it were a part-
time job, like Saga or Forum desk.
I intend to be a student, aware of
what’s going on in SGA, and make
some viable change in the campus
structure, but i am not going to
allow SGA to bog me down andbring
me to bedlam with all the tiny pid-
dling mannerisms and accountri-
ments of the job. The Student Coor-
dinator's office is openforhusiness.
not for ego-tripping, ego-building,
games, nor any other sort of hoe—
kurn. Those who don’ttlike it, can
lump it!

In accordance with my belief in
ecology, all Student Coordinator's
reports will be single spaced, and no
longer than one page in length.
