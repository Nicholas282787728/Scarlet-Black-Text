There’s one thing we all know
about a League Board president.
and that is that she is a pretty
busy person But did you know
that this years League Board
proxy hails from Oak Park,
Illinois? That she lives in Read?‘
That her name is - well, of
course, you know - Ellie Park.

Ellie's name is not new
mung those who lead us in
campus activities (or she was
social chairman of Cleveland
during her freshman year and
also on the lipr freshman
common. A: a sophomore

Ignoring the academic life
for a minute. Ellie has an envi.,
able record of interesting sum-t
mers. Her first three yars of
summer paychecks were earned
as a waitress and cottage girl
at Connerenre Point camp, Lake
Geneva, Wis. Ellie admits,
though, that the fun and ex
perionces she had there were
far more valuable and mem~
orable than the sine of the pay.
checks.

Another summer on Lake
Geneva was spent at a place
familiar to many Collegel
Camp. the George W1lliam col—
lege summer campus.

Ellie claims it was during the
summer of 1951 when She was
working as assistant chef in an
Estes Park, Colo. resort, that
she acquired a great love for
the west. And this love seems
to be undaunted by the fact
that she was in a mountain
climbing party that was lostl
for 28 hours! |

Ellie will probably regard
this past summer, however,
as one of her most profitable
and memorable. It was spent 1
in Washington, D1 0., with

Ellie had the chance to do a lot

A responsible consul ng organization has
reported the results of a continuing study by a
competent medical specialist and his staff on the

A group of people from various walks of life

was organized to smoke only Chesterﬁelds.

normal amount of Chesterﬁelds— 10 to 4_() a day.
45% of the group have smoked Chesterfields con-
tinually from one to thirty years for an average of

10 years each.

At the beg ning and at the end of the six-
months period each smoker was given a thorough
