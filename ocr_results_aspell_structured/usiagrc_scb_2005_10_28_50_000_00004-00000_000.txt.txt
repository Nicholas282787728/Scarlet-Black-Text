tuitous violence into it movie that ends up being like
most other horror movies these days: aiieiitge,

The zombies in Land oft/1i; Den/[have gained one
new trait, the ability to communicate, and have takr
en over the world The only outpost for the humans
lies in a willed off city, mine the entire population
is poor and starving, except for the rich living' in the
city's dominating high rise, Village Green. The head
ofVillagc Green, Kaufman (an unconvincing Dennis
Hopper) employs his own soldiers to go out, kill coin»
bies and return with supplies. Romero uses Kaufman
as his social statement, one that’s particularly relevant
in a posr»l<atrina 50061:» The city has an immense
divide between rich and pooi; the rich can drink mar-
tinis and bask in the security ofVillage Green while
the pool struggle to survive.

Kaufmans two most important henchman, Riley
(Simon Baker) and Cholo (John chuizamo), both
have conﬂicts early in thc movie with Kaufman and
denide to iebel against him. Cholo becomes the evil
one, while Riley assembles i group of friends led by
Slack (Asia Argento), who is rescued fiom certain
death in a zombie wrestling match. When the plot
finally settles itself, Riley is hunting Cholo (who his
blackmailed Kaufman), with the zombies attacking
(and consuming) at almost every possible moment.
Of course, this is about all we know, as the characters
are so generic that the viewer is given no reason to
care about them.

If there’s one thing that Romero movies thrive
on, it is making zombies look incredibly real, Makeup
artist Gregory Nicotero does a fantastic job ofmaking
the zombies full of whatever life it is that they have.
Romero also takes the blood and gore of a typical
zombie movie and multiplies it, Decapitations, may
5ch amounts of blood and dead zombies are child‘s
play for Romero, who takes hoiroi violence to new
levels.

Unfortunately, this violence doesn't mean that this
movie is terribly scary, Romero throws in some to-
ken jumpy moments every once in a while, but the

_wooden plot is incredibly predictable, thus leaving
Romero unable to build any tension for a climactic
moment. On the plus side, Romero at least embraces
the movie's ridiculousness with a witty script extolling
the virtues of Samoan carjacking and zombie target
practice, while also adding some generic Btmovie stu-
pidity to give the movie a traditional low-budget feel.

Land efiie Dead has its moments, but they are
offset by the movie‘s shortcomings, For every enter
taining zombie fight, there is an awful scene ofdumb
dialogmc. lo the end, the movie really has nothing to
add to the horror genre and solely caters to the audit
ence who either loves horror movies or loves excessive
violence.

Broken Flowers (R)

in nivlru F/azut'll filmmaker Jim Juriniisch gives
us a film that presents itscl lfin i quirky, wry ind saie
(lOl‘ilC wait An aging Don Juan Don Johnston (yes,
the Miami vice .efercnce is on piiipose) is poitraycd
by Bill Murray the mister of such quirky characters.
Murray is the only actoi th it should have been cons
sideieri to play this role and pulls it off as no one else
could. Johnston his made millions on computers
and yet does not have one in is own house. He has
been dumped by his llttest girlriiend (played by the
always alluring Julie Delpy) and has a habit of never
leaving his sofa. Then ouc‘day Johnston receives an
anonymous letter telling him that he may have a 19»
year sold son out looking for him. At first he brushes
this aside, biit urged on by his ncXE door neighbor
and friend Winston, he decides to go on a journey
to discover which ofhis old flings could have written
the letter, He visits five ofhis cx-girlfrieiids, ranging
from the widow ofa iacecar drivcr (Sharon Stone),
to an animal-psychic (Jessica Lange), The greatest
part ofthe film is watching the interactions between
Murray and the women, since each woman reacts
differently to Don's piesence, and each one hints at
the nature of their past relationship. Not to spoil the
ending, but many questions are left unanswered, and
this may frustrate some and intrigue others. Just don't
expect a typical Hollywood ending in this film,

Broken Flowers is an indie film with a superb

cast. its a comedy but doesn’t have many laughs

outsloud moments, opting for more subtle humor. in
other words, it is quintessential Jim Jarmusch; fans of
iarmiiseh's earlier work such as Coﬂee mid Gig/1112M:
will love this film, although others may not agree with
larmusch's indie sensibilities.

rtles Can Fly (PG 13)

TIMI/El Cm) Fly takes a ievealing look it a war-torn
culture through the eyes ofchildren. And it certainly
is qualiﬁed to do so; it is the first movie to be filmed
in Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein.

Because ofthe absence ofadult characters, the film
is different from other movies dealing with the same
subject. Directed by the Kurdish Bahman Ghobadi,
the film supports no overt political message; it neither
takes sides in the war in Iraq nor bothers to point fine
gets for the many minefields that dot the landscape,
though they themselves play an integral role.

The film’s main character, Satellite, has become
the leader of the children from his village, a Kurd~
ish refugee camp on the IraqisTurkish border. Satel-
lite has carried his name for traveling from village to
village where he convinces the elders to pay him for
installing satellite televtsion antennas. It is this slight
technical prowess, combined with a minimal English
vocabulary gleaned from American television. which
elevates him in the eyes of his peers. The children

clear ﬁelds of mines, which they trade as currency
and sell to the United Nations for small compensa—
tion. Satellite finds his leadership complicated when
three strange children arrive from another village. At
the same time, all the children uncomfortably and imt
patiently await the arrival ofAmeriean troops, which
they expect to be a great spectacle.

The cinematography manages to bring out the
beauty in a muddy landscape filled with barbed wire,
trailer homes and minefields This film cxccls, how—
ever, on the strength of its chiltlren and their charac-
ters. Employing a cast ofchildien actually deformed
in miiiefields, Ghobadi creates remarkably complex
lead and supporting characters. satellites conflict be-
tween responsibility and arrogance is welldeveloped
and the three outsiders have a wonderfully mystical
quality. Bleak though their lives may seem, the char
acters still find joy in their lives and bring i smile to
the viewer. In one particularly memorable moment,
an armless boy stoically head butts his adversary 7 an
image wonderfully reminiscent of the Taxi Di-ieri-
scene, “You talkin' to me?"

Regardless ofthe different outlook children bring
to this war, the film is certainly not an uplifting one,
though I would hesitate to call it overly depressing.
This could very well be the only Kurdish film that you
will ever see, and though marred by subtitles and the
absence of that Hollywood polish, this film will show
you war in a way that you have never seen before.
