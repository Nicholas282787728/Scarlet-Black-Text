I. B. Grinnell: Early Pro

by Don Dagenais

It was in the summer of 1853 when Hore
ace Greeley, then the renown editor of the
New York Tribune, received a caller in
his otiice. The young man, a vigorous
preacher, had been exhorting to themasses
in an anti-slavery crusade, but had de
veloped a sure throat and frazzled nerves.
What, he Greeley, could he do?

”Go West, young man, go West,” was
the editor's reply. “There is health in
the country, and room away 'lrom our
Crowds of ldlers and imbeciles.“ The last
part, Greeley’s own prescription for the
cure or laryngitis, has been largely tor-
gotten by history. But the first has lived
through the years,

founded with the help of some friends and
a large amount at cash inherited by his
wile a town and a college.

Once settled in Iowa, Grinnell Continued
his antlrslavery campaign. A man ot large
sensibilities and great humane instincts,
he was involved in the underground mile
road which helped runaway slaves get to
Canada. ln March of 1859 his house also
served as a haven for John Brown, ﬂeeing
from “bleeding Kansas”onhls illsfaled way
to Harper's Ferry.

Grinnell’s ﬂexibility, however, halted when
it came to one particular subiect: booze.
As students familiar with the landsrevers
sion clause of his will well know, he sancs
tioned no consumption ot the spirits on
the lands he donated for the college
His puritan New England background may
well have been the basis for his beliefs,
but his aversion might well have been
lormulated in another way as well. As a
boy, Grinnell once Competed in a elders

snilling contest (to find out “who could
longest inhale at the bung") which evidently
left him with a tremendous hangvover.

Grinnell College Students, who earlierthis
year were investigating the legal ramilie
cations ot establishing a pub on campus,
may well still be feeling the effects of that
hangover, The pioneer’s convictions, once
held, were tirm, as the clause indicates
Perhaps a final story best illustrates the
point.

Elected to Congress mice during the early
1860’s, Grinnell lost no opportunitytoberate
his fellow legislators on the subject of Ne-
gro rights. On one occasion during a lull
in the debate a member rose to propose

that to lighten the atmosphere “our pasv

Undaunted, Grinnell leaped to his teat,
threw back his head and belted out the
following:

Are we rebels still alive,
And dare we yet rebel?
And is it not amazing grace
That we are out oinhell?

The respose brought the house down
Grinnell had proven his commitment to
his beliefs, and probably would have hoped
that in the future his young college would
do the same.

The green 77ryeal'rold house at
1125 Broad is onetypicaltocrinnell.
What distinguishes it from the other
houses of the block is that, as the
sign confirms, it is the home of the
Grinnell Historical Museum

The museum proiect began in 1950
as a competition among the town's
women‘s groups. As a result of the
aroused enthusiasm tor the project,
it was placed under the care ol ft
newlyelorlned group, the Grinnell
Historical Museum Society, which
found a downtown site to house the
museum for three years until (I lire
destroyed much of the area,

In 1958 a twelve member auxiliary
to the original group was incorr
porated. This little group was able
at last to purchase the museum’s
present home iii 1967 through the stile
ota building given to them.
