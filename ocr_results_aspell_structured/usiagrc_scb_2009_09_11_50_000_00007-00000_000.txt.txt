SGA Films brings Sleeper, Brazil, Blade Runner, Up, more

HY CoLlN CARR

Entering into a new a ﬁlmegoing envie
ronment is always an experience.The insular
realm ofthe liberal arts college allows a small
community to create their own localized
sense of pop culture, their own homespun
ethos, and the ﬁlm selection at the Harris
cinema signiﬁes this dynamic at work.

Here you’ll ﬁnd no microcosm of what
Hollywood has to otter. Though it would
be generous to say the SGA ﬁlms commits
tee provides a truly radical or subversive ale
ternative to mainstream filmmaking, their
selection undoubredly demonstrates the ﬁlm
committee’s taste for the irreverent. And at its
best the selection constitutes a gutsy indicae

tian orthe madcap Gtinnellian sensibility.

The presentation ofbleak seieri pieces like
Ridley Scott's masterfully constructed Blade
Runner and George Lucas' early experiment
THX 1138 shows that even if the ﬁlm come
mittee does not stray far from bigename ptor
ductions,it at least searches for ﬁlms that take
risks within the mainstream. A more recent
sci-ﬁ thriller to be played at Harris is Moon,
a debut by Duncan Jones, David Bowie’s son,
This futuristic triad won’t play until early Dee
cember but it is something to look forward to,

The committee plans to show a similarly
idiosyncratic selection of comedies, from
woody Allen's classic Sleeper to Terry Gile
liam’s Brazil, a gorgeously shot and discomr

The Most Terrib

The Code:

torrin'gly runny depicrion of an Orwellian
dysropia. For some lighter and more childlike
humor, students should catch Peter Doctet’s
inventive Pixar movie Up. Up and Brazil
aren’t playing until early October, though
Sleeper will screen this Saturday.

But there are some downsides to the SB,
lectin this semester. Some of the "classic”
films the cinema provides, such as Field of
Dreams and Ghandi, are srreamlined yuppie
entertainments, both bland and sterile ﬁlms
that illustrate the dangers inherent in trusting
the provincial American Film Institute as a
true canonical authority.

There are also a few too many trashy
mainstream cold turkeys, such as Yes Man

There's just one copy ordirectoi Kaizo Haynshi's detece
the film The Code in the United States and it belongs to
Teri Geller, English.

This Friday in the Harris cinema, Geller will introduce
the Japanese film in its North American premiere.

“The Code is a movic length version of one [the] De
tective Office 5 ‘wcbisodcs,'" Geller said. The anline shoits
chronicle the adventures or a vtiricty or detectives, an
avanttgatdc online entertainment project that has gone in—
rernarional in this fullaiength independent ﬁlm.

Though Hayashi's movies are scr in the present and fu-
ture, the ﬁlms are strongly inﬂuenced by more classic ﬁlm
movements such as French New Wave and American Film
Noir.

However, Hayashi's movies aren’t about artistic state—
ment alone. “VVhat’s cool about Hayashi is that he actually
was a detective for a while," Geller said. “so he has real
experience."

The ﬁlm also promises to be thoroughly entertaining.
“Other ﬁlms I’ve seen by this director are a mix of noir and
madcap comedy," Courtney Sheehan, an independent “vie
sual culture" major, said. “[Hayashi has] a really disrinerive
style— his films are basically hilarious.”

The Cultural Films Committee (CFC), ofwhich Sheer
han and Geller are members, is responsible for screen~
ing The Code. The committee has recently shifted from
screening once a week to showing ﬁlms in a more or an
event capacity. The CFC focuses equally on the ﬁlms' en-
tertainment and intellectual value.

“[The CFC aims] to bring more ofa conversation about
film and cinema in general to the campus,“ Geller said.
“We want to provide the academic context for understand-
ing cinema as a... cultural language that is international.”

As a part ofth‘is project, the committee will be showing
Cinema Paradiso, an ltaiian film abour inreregeneration-
ni relationships, over family weekend. As a contrast, and
somewhat in conjunction with SGA ﬁlm’s Blade Runner, it
later screening will show the visually stunning, post-apoc-
alyptic film Brazil.

In early October the CFC plans to host an event featur-
ing a series ofshort ﬁlms accompanied by srudcnr musical
performances, from Jazz to Freesound. The semester will
conclude with "Grinnell Cinefest"on Dec. 4-6.The tinnunl
festival’s first theme will be international women’s cinema,
in honor of the 20th anniversary of Gender and Women

This move to create a more active
life for international and artistic films
at Grinnell reﬂects an overall trend on
Campus,

“There have been an increasing
numbei of students interested in ctee
atiiig a ﬁlm culture here and who have
been kind of frustrated with the lack
of choices in terms of ﬁlm viewings."
Sheehan said. The CFC hopes to pmr
vide an outlet for this interest, and even
to establish Grinncll as a regional rilm
center.

"One of the things Grinnell’s lack—
ing is that you don’t live near a major
city where you can go to international
film fests and that's such a huge part
of my love of mm," Geller said. “one
of the things I do is go ro rilm tests
every year and bring tilms back ro
campus to help educate and expose
students to other cultural ﬁlms."

Beginning With the comedic and
visual stylings of The Code and cone
eluding with a challenging series orine
ternational womens’ cinema, complete
with studentesponsored discussions,
the CFC promises to develop, through
ﬁlm, another layer of quirky aesthetics
and intellectual content in Gtinnell’s
artistic community.

The aim of these ﬁlms is not only
to entertain but also to challenge.
“Once you engage with another Clll’
ture’s standards and beloved artists,
you start to question your own,” Sheer
him said.

and 16 Blocks, the kind offllms that even the
directors knew were going to he the duds they
would never show their children.

But these disappointments are in the mi-
nority. Some ofthe classics presented at Bar»
ris, such as David Lean’s Lawrence ofArabia,
playing mideNovember, are delightful must-
sees for anyone even vaguely interested in the
potential of the medium. And the majority
of the contemporary ﬁlms being played are
personal and at times even dating. Despite
its limitations, this semester's selection will
present, at its best, quirky directorial visions
brought to life under commercial strictures,
which isn’t common and deserves to be vale
ued.
