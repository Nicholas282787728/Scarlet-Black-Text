live tormally organized prospective
weekends will have taken place, and
approximatelyzlant those who visit will
return in SCplUinl)Br at 1980. according
to Director of Admissions John
Hopkins

Prospective uockends this year
began around Veterans Day, when
(ii‘innell invited interested students
lrom 10 states in the midwcsl area, The

The differences between Individual
visits by prospectives and oiticial
prospective weekends are very small in
the long run, but in the short term,
large Scale visits allow the Admissions

ofﬁce to set up an extensive travel
schedule and thus interview more
applicants Prospective weekends orier

However, Hopkins said prospeptive
