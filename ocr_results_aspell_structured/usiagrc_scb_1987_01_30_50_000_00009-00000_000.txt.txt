Boys “Run” With Beat

by Sam Perlman
Who do these Beastie Boys think they
really are? Do they really think that three
’white guys can actually compete in the
black world of rap music? They sure do.
'and anyone who stands in their way “be ilr
lin'l” If black rap is the music of the
streets it's supposed to be. then the Beastie
Boys are the music and the message of the
suburban shopping “maul." These three

guys may take their music seriously. but
life is another storyl They are having too
much lun in search of the ultimate party to
care about much anything else.

So what if they copy Run-DMC and‘every
other rap group? What these guys are say-
ing is too dillerent to be compared. This is

An exhibition of the graphics oi
Czechoslovakian artist Jan Kreici will
open with a reception on sunday.
February 1. from 3:00 lo 5:00 pm. in the
Print and Drawing Study Room in Burling
Library. The iortyiive prints and drawV
ings. done between 1965 and 1985. will
make up the ﬁrst solo exhibition at
Krcjci’s work in a public gallery in the
United States. Betty and Gerald
Werksman. who loaned the collection to
the college, and Ann Baruch. who
discovered KrejCI's work ,in
Czechoslovakia. will be attending the
reception,

Krejci was born in Plzell.
Czechoslavakia. in i942. He studied at the
Academy 01 Applied Arts in Prague bet-
Ween 1961 and 1966. and in 1958 won first
prize in the International Biennial ot

Graphics at Florence. Among the institus
tlons which have included Krejcl‘s
graphics in recentlexhihllions are the Na-
tional Gallery of Canada. the Art Institute
ol-Chicago. and the Yale University School
of Art.

Krejci has been priased as a Superb
draitsman and his etchings are executed
with the highest degree of technical skill.
Yet his prints and drawings are nol always
easy to view, for he depicts that which we
might order not to see. Krejci's early
works exude raw power and display a
tuscinatiori with sex and a preoccupation
with Violence and death, His later Works
Show an altitutde toward life which is
more subtle, with less anger and more
tolerance and humor, .

The exhibition will Continue through
March 13. Posters and catalogs of the ex
hibition are available in the Print Room
