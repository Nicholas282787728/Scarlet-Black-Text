Grinnellians not sleepy lab rats

Ah, the end oftlie semester is upon us and I’ve been feeling
a tension of opposites about its conclusion. Part or me is sad
because summer means a three—month respite from the oodles
(yes, i use the word cud/er. 1 also occasionally say my dozen) of
Grinnellians I've become so fond of over the past two years.
But another part ofme can't wait to
go home so 1 can finally catch up on
my sleep.

The Grinnell Wellness Com-
mittee has been working hard to
raise awareness about the college's
chronic problem with sleep dcprlvlr
tion,This semester posters have pe-
riodically been tagged around cam-
pus commanding us to “Go to bed!" and reminding us that
lack ofsleep diminishes our ability to think creativity, to think
critically and to be healthy and happy individuals,

While I think the GWC's signs are well-intentioned, I
must admit that being confronted by a barrage ofthem in the
south Campus loggia while returning home at 5:30 in the
morning after finishing a paper, studying for a Spanish test
and trying to complete all my reading for the following day is,
well, a bit infuriating,

l support the campaign to improve our sleep habits, but i
believe that these signs that warn us that lab rats die without
sleep seem to ignore a bigger issue.

We already know that we should sleep. We know how ter-
rible we feel when we don’t get enough. The problem isn't a
lack ofawareness.The problem is Grinnell cultures Academic
pressures are high. we're involved in many extracurriculars.
Then throw family and friends into the mix and it isn’t sur—

prising that many of us struggle with getting our 40 winks in
(more like four). Fostering the loggias with signs selling us
to go to sleep when so many ofus desire to dojiist that doesn't
seem like the most effective way to go.

Wanting to stop throwing my hands up in despair at the
futility of my quest for a well-
rested evening, i do
cided to attend the

Throughout most of
the presentation,1 was
pretty disappointed.
The panel discussion seemed to be a restatement
of the thioiis: “Go to sleep. It's important,"

But the question I had nagging in the back
of my head was: Mail mean I understand the
gist ofir. My dorm room is equipped with a bed.
I brought a nice comfy pillow from home] know how to shut
off the Light switch.

But 1mm do I ignore that [rule voice iii my head [lull toys that

As these questions raced through my head, an angel in the
form of Grinnell alum and director of the Poweshiek County
Mental Health Center Harriett Dickey-Chasins spoke. Poised

obvious: ”Go to sleep, (1’:
important,”

But how?

and confident, she told the panel audience that Grinnellians
have to stop taking things so gosh darn seriously

She insisted that nothing academic is more important
than our health and well-being, and then, as a smirky addent
dum she said, “And you can tell your professors I said that."

Hartictr's words amazed me. Really, I had the sincere
urge to charge her with a thankful embrace and
a you go girl. "Justdont take things so seriously.
It was the best advice Id heard in a long time.

A recent random rant sent in by Miss Lau-
ra Lchdz to the SUB voiced a similar senti—
ment, Laura's rant suggested that good grades
won't make us better people and that bad ones
won't keep us from following our passions.
Reading this tall: also ﬁlled me with a simi-
lar urge to hug Laura, regardless of the fact
we've never actually spoken to one another.

And still, after absorbing these words
whose messages ring so close to my heart, I
type these words on a computer in Burling, my eyes hleary,
my back aching, and my comfy pillow sounding more inviting
every second.

So I’m not the best at following advice, even the kind that
I know is right. I know I would ideally like to he a well-rested
and chilledtout individual. But there is always a separation
between who we are and who we want to be,

My goal for now is to try to lessen this gap. 1 know i’m
not alone in feeling this way and I want to reach out and get
others involved in my quest for rest. I'm not exactly sure how
to go about doing this. Maybe I’ll hang up some signs in the

loggia.

Neoliberalism hits too close to home

Neo, cont. from p. 7

or political value (even ifa seemingly impos-
sible one under global capitalism) with mar
ket values.

That may still seem a bit remote to you,
so let me provide other examples. How about
No Child Left Behind> Must public school
systems face a loss of funding if they dont
show results?” What kind ofresults do they
need to show?

Do we not in fact show that we are unt
committed to students as learners when we

ask them to behave like workers in a comp at
ny ? Do we not in fact leave children behind
when we judge their learning “inefficient" and
therefore put their “jobs"on the line?

Even closer to home: ifyou find yourself
in a city this summer, note whether there are
or have been debates about whether public
demonstrations (for or against the wars in
lraq and Afghanistan, for or against immit
grants' rights) constitute unacceptably high
expenditures for municipal police budgets.

Then ask yourself whether there isn't

something wrong with the idea that demo-
cratic political expression should be held to
Cost- benefit analyse57indeed, not just held to
them but placed on the lasing side ofthem.

Or the next time you find yoursch at a
museum, that is, a public institution entrusted
with preserving and supporting visual culture,
ask yourself whether it seems committed
more to selling admission tickets than to sup-
porting innovative aesthetic expression.

Are major museums more interested in
their national or global profile or in fulfilling

their ostensible missions? In ﬁnding banks
able art or challenging the way that people
experience the world?

The point here is that neoliberalism does
not simply refer to economics or political
economy but entails the colonization of so,
cial, political and culmral life by market tar
tionalitics. In fact, as an ideology it may fail
to achieve full coherence (and is certainly not
monolithic), but as a set of mentalities, mo,
liberalism is close. than you think, perhaps
hcmniiiig you in on all sides.

Join the big media conspiracy.
Or try to fight it from inside.
