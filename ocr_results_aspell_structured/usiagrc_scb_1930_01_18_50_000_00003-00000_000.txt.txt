Among the things which might in-

the outdoor theatre, which has been
constructed in the woods by the girls;
a primitive camp, where groups live
for several days; and Sherwood For—
est and Trails End, two other camps:
in the woods. At the central camp
at Maqua there is an Arts and Craft
building, a library, lodge and cabins
to accommodate all the campers.

Camp Maqua is situated on 300
acres of land heavily wooded with
pines and birches some forty miles in
from the Maine coast on a large
lake.

Dorothy Phillips; I don‘t believe
this is a very good plan because the
same students usually participate in
most outside activities and it might
tend to lower the quality of the work
in general.

Frank Davis: Such a plan has no
value. It would merely restrict a
student of real ability and would not
increase the activities of others not
inclined tax extra-curricular activi-
ties.

Archie Allison: I am not in favor
of such a system. Capable students
will always be chosen to take part in
campus activities. therefore they
should be'allowed to do everything
they have time for.

Alice Cope: A very good idea.
More than half of us are so busy
“helping out" on some cooperative
committee that we fail to accomplish
any individual tasks.

Dale Mccii It doesn't make any
difference. Eligibility rules prevent
one from carrying enough outside
activities to interfere with his work.

Hciiiple was enabled to carry on he
work through a grant of money ale
loted to the Chemistry department
from the Norris fund, which was
started by Dr Norris. after the death
of Professor Heiidrickson, former
head of the department.

These rcpoits will be of value to
chemistry students, because under

Iowa Music Head .
Talks Wednesday,

“Don't stay out of composition be-
cause you think you can't create a
world's masterpiece. If you have
pleasure in composing the chances
are you will give pleasure to others
through the music which you create,”
said Phillip G. Clapp, head of the
Department of Music at the State
University of Iowa, in an address
given Wednesday evening in Herrick
chapel.

Most everyone has had at some
time the desire to sing or play an in
striiment, but many people are
ashamed to sing or compose because
they think they can't attain profes-
sional skill. . .

“However, everyone who feels like
composing should do so. If you fell
the urge to compose you ought to he
doing " he said.

Using the piano Mr. Clapp illu-
strated Beethoven's method of com-
posing the Fifth Symphony. He
showed that a composition is der
veloped through the trial and error
process and does not spring complete
and perfect by chance.

Several cases were cited by Mr,
Clapp in which college was the en-
vironment in which the ﬁrst interest
in composition started. Here the
best teachers, the facilities, and the
opportunity to hear good music may
be had,

Librarian Says Stack System Tentative;

_ Wants Students to Have Access to Books,

Joe Marchelliiio will roll in wealth
from repairing the soles of the ass
sistant librarians. Soon the lonely,
dusty tables in the stacks will grace-
fully cellapse from disuse. Yet the
new system of “This room for use of
the library stsff only," and "Ring
for librarian" continues to be a suc»
cess.

“As yet the system is tentative,“
remarked Miss Gretta Smith, Ilh~
rarion. "The clamors and protests
of the students against the system
have not been nearly so great as we
anticipated. While a few do pro—
test, the majority of the student body
realize that it was necessary to take
some action to keep the library
books.

“We hope to work out a plan
whereby the students may brouse
among at least some of the less
valuable books.” said Miss Smith.
“The idea of allowing students to
enter the stacks and have the books

checked as they leave does not seem
advisable. If a person is dishonest,
he would ﬁnd some way to conceal
a book up his sleeve or trouser leg.
And that system would make it
necessary to have someone tied down
to a desk every minute."

"it is hoped that we will be able
to ﬁx up a reading room in the south
end of the down stairs section. Here
the less valuable books of ﬁction and
travel could be kept on shelves, and
chairs and lamps arranged for the
students to use.

"Or perhaps the students could be
allowed into the stacks on special
occasions with a permit from their
major professor who would take the
responsibility for the honesty. The
librarians certainly cannot know per-
sonally who is honest and who is
not. .

“The system is still so new that it
is impossible to deﬁnitely determine

 

Its Success.”
