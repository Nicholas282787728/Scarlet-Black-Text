in regard to Mr. Marshall‘s
letter (November 19, 1976), CBS
wishes 'to iniorm the campus
community that;

1. CBS does not and has never
advocated or supported

#

separatism .

2. CBS’ constitution contains no
regulations excluding whites from
CBS activities.

3. CBS has sponsored activities
at the Black Cultural Center this
semester which were open to the
entire campus community but
were poorly attended by the
general campus,

4. The administration is fully
aware of CBS' policies and will
neither tolerate nor subsidize an
organization violating its “itonr
discriminatory policy.“

Turkey talk,

by Scottnlcniiirray

Dear lilac. l was passing by on
that I~BU when ldecided to stop in
at the Skelly and send you this
quick Thanksgiving message, i'iii
hauling a load oi gnbbicrs to that
big Cliirtovin. so naturally my
thoughts were on the holiday.
’l‘llcrc I am. thinking about what a
bunch of goddamn iairies thosc
Puritans must have been to wear
high heels and ﬂoppy hats \Alllle
thcy hunted. when suddenly it hits
me—they were the actual
iorctathcrs oi tllc N,R./\ I

Damn, Mac. I'm not kidding you,
the way i get these insights,
sometimes i think i shtlulda been a
goddamn philosopher instead ot a
dumb geargrinder. Really, i got
nothing to complain about,
although God knows i paid my
share of tolls in lite See? There I
go again.

Anyway, as everybody knows.
the New World was crazy with
wildlile. Diaries written at. the timc
tell of forests “overflowing" with
deer, and rivers “teeming" with
fish. 1 ask you, is that natural?
imagine how the colonists musta
been sickened at a sight of those

hill7 Something had to be done to
keep impressionable youngsters

saying there wcrc too many lIl-l
dians (although who am i to know
what the Great White Father had
in mind, when you look at the way
things went ior those peoplel What
I'm saying is even the savages
knew there was too much game
around. They showed the colonists
the primitive way they tried to
control the fish population by
burying excess hair in their iields
They also unloaded all kinds of
dead animals on the settlers as an
excuse to see their guns

Which brings me to my point,
even |E i did take the bypass route
to get here. You've always been
told that those Puritans were
giving thanks for the good harvest
and all that. right? Bull, nothing
but bull, Any third grader can tell
you that the U s oi A. has the best
soil in the world. Hell. crops grow
like weeds around here and it was
the same tor the Puritans, No. the

 

poor creatures righting each other

winthrop and his boys made such a

Dannon Yogurt, a true story. Two weeks ago after emerging
from the Forum, l spied the Dannon Yogurt Truck heading west on

Highway 5. i yumpea into m

trusty vehicle and gave on 'e .

tiirough the streets oi Grinne l in hot pursuit oi that tasty my tical
product oi the east known as Dannon Yogurt. At high s eeds, I
chased Dannon south on 146m 1-80. Then as we entered l-80 eading
east, l iioored my rattlin machine and with a thrust pulled along
side at the Dannon Triic -. with a iiurry at hand movements, I
signaled lo the driver to pull over, He gave me a bewildered look
and stepped on it, After giving chase to the Montezuma extt with no
hope oi getting the damn truck to piili over. lgavc up to pursue the
cause another day. (He told me later that he was irom Chicago and
was airaid at being mugged) Dannon Yogurt has arrived and is

selling in the College Forum.

Thank you
Dave McConnell
