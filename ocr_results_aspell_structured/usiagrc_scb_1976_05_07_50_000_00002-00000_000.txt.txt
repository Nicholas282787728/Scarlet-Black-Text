SGA decision

To the Editor.

After much debate the following
motion was approved 134 by the
SGA, Moments later by a vote of
1079 it was retract/ed and replaced
by the motion appearing in today’s
paper (see brieis). i feel that the
retracted motion more adequately
expresses the concerns of many
students and that it should not go
unheard.

“Be it resolved that, we the joint
board elect oi Grinnell College,
wish to express our disapproval of
the administration's recurring
tendency to make signiiicant
changes in academic policies
which affect students Who enrolled
lmdei‘ previous policies. it is our
opinion that Grinnell College, in
portraying itseli as a 4-year in
stitution, is bound to retain those
aspects of academic life which it
advertises.

“Specifically we refer to the
method in which the new
curriculum proposal has been
considered. We feel that student
opinion has not been adequately
explored. We detect opposition
Within the Student body with an
issue as serious as this involving an
integral part of the College‘s
program such as the grading and
credit-erase program which air
tracted many students here in the
beginning. We ieel student opinions
should be more adequately heard
berore such changes are made. We
recommend that the adminstration
and faculty postpone their decision
on said changes until the true
feelings of the student body can be
voiced.

“Adopted 134, Wednesday, May
5, 1976." (Later Withdrawn and
replaced with a 1079 vote.)

People complain that no one
cares about SGA and I find that to
be true simply because SGA has
failed to exercise any real power.
Time and time again when dealing
withpoliciesoimaior consequence
SGAhas allowed the adminSLrau'on
to impose its desires on the student
body with no protest from SGA,
Maybe if SGA stood up for
something and actually voiced its
disapproval people would listen.
The curriculum proposal is so vital
to all students and there is enough
confusion surrounding it that there
must be more consideration before
action is taken. Kevin Martin

 

 

Kent State

To the Editor:

The {lying or ﬂags at hali mast

May A were well-taken reminders
of the Kelli State killings.
However, it was also a reminder of
the unconscious disrespect paid to

responsible ior the display had
given the matter a minimum of
thought, I'm sure they could have
arrivedat a more appropriate way
to commemorate her death.

Relays success

To the Editor:

The Fourth Annual Grinnell
Relays has been adjudged a suc-
cess by all in known survivors.
Many people contributed to its
success, but we would like to
especially thank a iew people who
were especially responsible: Jeri
Bob ior organizing the Titular
Heilll contest; David Kinney and
Jim Freeman for organizing the
events; Abbi Swanson, Linda
Cornelius, Kate Waldo, Joel
Spiegel, David Ten Eyck, and
Denese Cosper for their tireless
‘work on the committee; all the
officials and bouncers; Bob
Wintersand Jim Hayward for their
convertibles; the Pub people; the
golden voices of Mike Daley and
Jeff Miller; Max Jones, Tom
Latimer, Keenan Roberts, and
especially to Evel Tederman and
Dean Walker for their Willing
assistance and support.

We would also like for the entire
campustojoin us in a Bronx cheer
for “Colonel" Will Collins for
proving himself a wimp in the ﬁrst
degree when he failed to present
himself for his muchrpublicized
duel with Dean Walker.

Thanks again, one and all. Russ
Damon. Shirley Keenan.

CORRECTION

it was erroneously sLated in the
article “Pub reduces trustee
debt,” April 30, 1976, that Dick Vos
was appointed to the Pub Board of
Directors. Barry Huff has been
appointed to this position vacated
by Vos ior the academic year l976»
1977.

Harold Stessel. assistant
professor ot‘English and American
Studies, recently accepted a two»
year Fullbright Lcctureship at
Gothenburg, chdcn. He was
accepted from an applicant pool or

position in the second largest city
and main port of Sweden.

Gothenburg is recognized .
having the finest American Studies
program of the ﬁvemajor Swedish
universities. About ten years ago,
Professor Joseph Wall had ’
American Studies lectureship

Stessel hopes to compare
American and Swedish urban
planning, Most Swedish cities, he
pointed out. have been extensively
planned compared to the sporadic,
unregulated growth of American
cities. Gothenburg itseli was layed
out around three hundred years
ago by a group of Dutch city
planners. ‘

Stessel’s contract was up ior
renewal this past fall. Although he
asked to be notified by November
first, the College was unable J
make any decision until December
eighth, This delay was due to the
fact that the trustees had not
decided until then that thr A
iaculty positions were to e
eliminated, It was in this time
period that Stessel applied tor the
Fullbright because he saw ”many
opportunities for growing as a
teacher and a writer.” He noted,
however. that “If my contract had
been renewed earlier l never would
have applied for the Fullbrlght.”

Stessel's request for a two-year
leave of absence was denied by
Nollen House on the grounds that
he had not been at Grinnell 16'
enough to be eligible for a sé
batical. Consequently, Stessel may
well be spending his last months
here, He expressed sorrow at
leaving Grinnell and regret at i
having had the opportunity to Wo

Grinnell an “incredibly sane
place” compared to other schools
at which he has taught. He is
hoping that a position will be open
here when he comes back so that
he may apply for it.
