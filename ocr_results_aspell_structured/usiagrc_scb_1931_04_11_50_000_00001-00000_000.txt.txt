Last Lecture

‘ by Maynadier

Harvard Professor Speaks
on Arthurian‘Poets
Friday Night

“There has been no truly great
poetry dealing with the Arthurian
legend since Tennyson,” observed
Gustavus Howard Maynndicr. Halt
vard exchange professor, in his last
lecture in Herrick chapel yesterday
evening. “Eighty pieces of literature
with this theme have been published
in the English since his time,”

"Poets since Tennyson have taken

to marked tendencies. First they have
introduced new characters and inci-
dents, but the plot has remained un-

changed. Second, they have C'lollled‘

the characters. Gllinevere‘s inﬁdelity
to her husband is excused."

According to Mr. Maynadier, the
Arthurian legend'has a basis in his
tory. There once was an able British
general who led his people to victory
against the invading Angles, Saxons.
and Jutes, His people were the ans
cestors of the Welsh and Bretons of
France. The general became a na-
tional hero. and popular stories were
circulated concerning his deeds. These
tales were ﬁrst put into literary form
by Geoffrey of Monmouth. and in
1225 they became ﬁxed as they are
now known.

Among prominent writers who are
good Arthurian poets, Professor May:
adier lists Richard Hovey, .1, Cum-
mings Carr, Lawrence Binyon, Mich-
ael Field, Edgar Lee Masters. John
Erskine. Thomas Hardy, and John
Maseﬁeld,

BODINE To SPEAK
The zoology department will be in
charge of the next regular meeting
of the Science club, April 20. J. H.
Bodine, professor of zoology at the

Prep Capt, Picnics Certain Sign

Spring Hus Come

Fresh Once
Don Head Covering
After Vacation

Poor Again

Heralds of spring have a way about
them of forgetting to fulﬁll their
promises. The ﬁrst robinirumblings
and rumors from the baseball camps
ipoetic olltblil‘stsithey may all be
discounted a great deal in considering
what kind of weather will actually
follow.

But Grinnell has two trustworthy
heralds that proclaim the lotus sea—
son, and they can be relied upon.
When prep caps and picnics appear,
winter has lied.

Dash foi- Fclt

The scarlet and black head cover—
ings were donned by freshmen im-
mediately following spring vacation,
After chapel, or between classes, one
may see the bobbing patches scatter-
ed hither and yon among the proces-
sions on the campus walk, Now and
then a lad forgets his honorable l'n-
signia, and dashes back to his room

 

to Grinnell Campus

for it, cursing the tiny piece of felt.

The cap lends a jaunty aspect to
the most digniﬁed and sedate fresh-
men. Yet it is insecure in a high
wind, and provides another item for
the list of things to be remembered
to take to class, The long winter sear
son with hats of one’s own choice, or
none at all, has produced carefree
feeling, and the preps struggle to keep
the tiny cap in mind,

Arbor Lake closed

As for picnics. which somehow or
other don't seem synonomous with
prep caps, they reign supreme among
the drifting thoughts of Grinnell’s
spring-bound students. Even the clos-
ing of Arbor Lake to the public, has
not dampened their spirits. In fact
the fencc which surrounds this body
of water will help to prevent dampen-
ing when the swimming season starts.
But then, puns have nothing to do
with picnics, or prep caps either.

It seems, so the rumor goes, that
the lake was offered for sale recently
by the company which owns it and
which has been piping soft water
from it. But no sale was made, and
so the fence is there.
