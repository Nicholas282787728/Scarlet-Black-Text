Phys.Ed. Subcontractor Files Suit

Grinnell College has been named as
co-defendant in a lawsuit brought by
the R. M. Boggs Co, Inc., one ofthe
subcontractors on the Physical Edu-
cation Building project. The other
defendant is Gilbert Builders, the
general contractor. Gilbert Builders
recently filed a countersuit against
Boggs.

R. M. Boggs Co., lnc. installed the
plumbing and heating systems in the
building. Vice President and Treas~
urer Donald Lambie told the 5&5
Tuesday that Bdggs is seeking to re-
cover extra costs which it claims
to have incurred due to the long

delays, which totalled 17 months

Still due and owing on the original
subcontract with Boggs is a final
installment of approximately
$30,000; Boggs claims that such
things as increased labor costs,
which he could not take into account
in making his original bid, have
Caused financial injury to the firm.
Mr. Lambie told the SdtB that the
terms of the college’s contract with
Gilbert Builders will probably pro-
tect the college from any financial
loss. The contract specifies that the
general contractor see that the col—
lege is “held harmless” In any ma-

Propose Elementary Ed
Program For Next Year

A proposal to establish an elemen-
tary education program has been
approved by the Executive Council
on an 3~1-l vote. Faculty debate
on the issue will begin Monday.
As proposed by Randell Magee,
Chairman of the Committee on
Teacher Education, the program will
upgrade the Education Department
from a two to a three man operation.
The Magee plan requires a total of
34 hours of approved work for elee
mentary certification.

Like students seeking secondary
school certification, students ene
rolled in the elementary education
program will be required to
complete a major in addition to their
education work,

Seven major points in favor oi the
program were raised by the Com—

To Celebrate
Holidays Here

This week marks the celebration
both of Passover and Easter for the
Jewish and Christian communities.
0n campus those celebrations are
being noted primarily with the Seder
Thursday night, the Easter sunrise
service Sunday morning and a late

The Seder was sponsored by Assoce
iated Jewish Students and was held
at 6:30 p.m, in Gardner Lounge with
a variety of Jewish Passover foods
served.

The sunrise service sponsored by
Grinnell Campus Christian rellow-.
ship will be at 6:30 a.m. on central
campus unless it rains; an alterna-
tive location will be chosen at that
time should the rain decide to fall.

Easter will be celebrated with
communion at the ll:ufi service in
Herrick Chapel with Mr. Haas lead-
ing services and the college choir
singing.

Local churches celebrated Maundy
Thursday last evening and will hold
Easter services Sunday, including
sunrise services.

mittee in its proposal to the Execue
tive Council:

1. That the addition of the program

would aid the College in recruiting

new students.

2. That the number of students

transferring out of Grinnell would

be reduced by the institution of the
program.

3. That the program would broaden

the offering of the Education De
partment.

4. That strong student interest
existed in the program, as evidenr
ced by a recent survey in which 21
students said they would definitely
enroll and 41 more indicated a
strong interest.

5. That Grinnell students are more

socially aware than most, and that

the program would provide a praCr
tical outlet for this social concern.

6. That “the Grinnell College grade

uate is the kind of teacher we would

like to see fill public school posi-
tions."

7. That institution of the program

would strengthen townecollege

relations,

The program's curriculum would
consist of a Escredit section of So-
cial Science, a arcredit section in
Philosophy, a ercredlt section in
Education, and a 4»credlt section in
American History. The Education
section would consist of “Analysis of
Educational Concepts“ plus four
mlnlecourses Covering Language,
Social Studies, Arithmetic, Science,
Art, Music, and Drama in Elemen-
tary Education.

In an interview with the 551.8 Wed—
nesday, President Leggett indicated
that the proposal for an elementary
education program will be brought
before Monday’s Faculty meeting ior
consideration.

if the Faculty approves the pro
posal, Trustee approval is also re-
quired before it could take effect.
Since the next Trustee meeting will
occur April 15 and 16, Leggett said
he hoped for speedy lacully action,
If approved as written, the new pr0~
gram would take effect this coming
fall, and a third staff member for
the Education Department would
need to be hired in the near future,

ters regarding the general Contrac-
tor's responsibilities on the project,

Gilbert was thus obligated to provide
the necessary liability insurance
while the project was in progress
and to protect the college from the
actions of any subcontractor. The
Boggs company could still obtain a
lien, which would attach the building
pending settlement, but Lambie cone
Siders this possibility ”remote”.

When the project was completed
last fall, the college told Gilbert
Builders that it would release the
final payment, a retainage of
$120,000, as soon as the general
contractor obtained from the subs
contractors the necessary lien wai-
vers. Such a waiver protects the
college from the possibility of hays
ing the building attached by any
subcontractor.

Gilbert obtained lhe waivers from
all the subcontractors except Boggs,
who insisted that he be paid approxi-
mately $46,000 more than was still
owing on his subcontract belore he
would sign the waiver. When the
Gilbert company refused to pay the
extra money, Grinnell College did
not release the final payment, pend-
ing a satislactory settlement. Shorte
ly thereafter, the Boggs company
filed suit in the amount of npproxi»
mately $76,000

News Analysis

On March 2, Gilbert Builders filed
a Countersuit, asking $96,000 actual
and $150,000 exemplary damages
from the Boggs company. The
matter has not yet been,resolved,
and Lambie predicts that it could
drag on for as much as two years.

Recently the college has refused
to allow the Gilbert Company to
examine the college’s files concern-
ing Boggs. Lambie said that he would
have had no objection had the Gilbert
company only been engaged in de-
fending itself and the college in the
original suit, but that any informae
lion Gilbert obtained now could just
as well be used in his suit against
Boggs, to which the college is not
a party.

RA System Questioned

by Lynn Lichtenburger

The validity of the present resident adviser system, which costs the
college approximately $40,000 in salaries, has been called into question

recently by both students and faculty.

In a letter to the Executive Council dated March 18, Gregory Guroff, and
Don Smith, History, questioned the “need of resident advisers and to serve
as surrogate parents (ii one may imagine such), big brothers and sisters,
and social directors ” They asked that the Council “consider whether the
current level of expenditures on non-academic advising can be justified in
view of the benefits received and ofthe economies which are being demanded

elsewhere.”

At $6,000 ($6500) fora nine-month year, plus a furnished apartment and
board, the resident adviser’s Job appears very attractive. Once a prospec-
tive RA has made an application, he or she is interviewed by one of the
Deans at the convention of either the National Association of Student Per-

sonnel Administrators or the National Women Dean Counselors.

The

large number of applicants who have applied recently has made it virtually
impossible to interview every candidate,

Due to a lack of funds, most prospective M's do not come on campus for
interviews. About two candidates for each position, or about is out ofa
total of 1000 applicants, come on campusforinterviews with the Counseling
Committee and are put through more rigorous interviews than are prospec—
tive faculty, Dean Connie Kimbo told the 5&8.

Student input into the selection process is limited to those on»campus
candidates who are interviewed by the Counseling Committee because
there is not enough money to send students to the conventions. of those
candidates who were accepted in onrcampus interviews last year, two did

not come, and one broke his Contract.

The job description advertised by Grinnell states: “The position has
administrative duties, with the primary emphasis upon facilitating an
atmosphere in which human growth and development are possible,.,itespon-
sinilitles include the counseling and advising ofapproximately 150 students,
with special emphasis on freshmen, and generally contributing to the im-
provement of the quality of social and academic life in the residence

halls...”

Referendum Issues

departments presently have EPC’s.
The SGA President would be responr
sible to see that EPC members are
chosen by the required time.

SGA would assume responsibility
for Seeing that certain other pro-
cedures are followed by the Com-
mittees, which would consult with
department members on educational
policy and personnel decisions. Af-
ter appropriate consultation with
students who have taken his or her
Courses, the committee would
”evaluate the performance of beach
ers whose Contracts are being con-
sidered for promotion or renewal,"
A description of the procedure an
EPC plans to use to evaluate stu~
dent opinion would be sent to the
Student Coordinator before the eval-
uation is made.

The second proposal would “in-
clude student members of the All-
College EPC as voting members of
the Student Government Associa-
tion‘s Joint Board”.

Academic matters are not now
mentioned in the SGA constitution;
passage of the proposals would ole
ficially enlarge the scope of SGA
activities to include both the social
and the academic aspects of a Grin-
nell education. It is hoped that putting
EPC members on the Joint Board
would help to bring academic con-
cerns effectively to its attention.
Russ McGregor explained, “I be-
lieve that rapid passage of these
amendments would contribute great-
ly to closing the credibility gap that
now exists between the academic
and social aspects of SGA.”

Copies of the proposed changes are
posted on all hall bulletin boards.

Gale, Him To
Retire In June

At least nine individuals will be
leaving the Grinnell faculty at the
end of the current semester, Presi-
dent Glenn Leggett told the SdzB
Tuesday,

Two longrtime staff members,
Velma Hiser (Professor of Com~
munications) and Grant Gale (PPOA
fessor of Physics) will retire at
the end of the current year. Mrs.
Hiser has been with the college
since 1937 and was promoted to
Professor of Communications in
1970. Mr. Gale joined the staff in
1923, became a full professor in
1942, and in 1961 was named the
S. S. Williston Professor of PhYSs
ics. After Gale leaves he will be
replaced as the senior member of
the faculty by William Oelke (Pro-
fessor of Chemistry, who joined
the staff in 1931.

Bonnie Hampton, Nathan Schwartz,
and David Abel of the Francesco
Trio have already announced that
they will be going to Stanford Uni-
versity next year.

Others leaving the faculty this year
and the dates they joined the faculty
are: Keith Fisher (Assistant Pro-
lessor of Chemistry), 1970; Eric
Jensen (Instructor in Music), 1971;
John Keeble (instructor in English),
1969: Theodore Will (Assistant
Professor of Physics), 1968.

Leggett told the SELB that there are
still two cases where a final de-
cision has not been made; probably
these will be completed shortly after
May 1.

Leggett would not tell the 5&3 yet
who has been hired for next year.
Some candidates have verbally ac-
cepted offers made to them, but
Leggett declined to make a public
announcement until they have signed
contracts.
