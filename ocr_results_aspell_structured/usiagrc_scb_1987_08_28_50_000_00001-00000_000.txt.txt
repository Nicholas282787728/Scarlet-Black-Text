Roommates

Assistant Dean of Students Tom
Crady and Director or student

former HAS, cite roommate con-
flicts and the intense pressure of
college work as particularly
prevalent problems among college
freshmen. Crady remembers one
case of a Freshman who arrived
early on campus and com-
mandeered his roommate's desk
as a support system for his stereo.
“College means adjusting to living
with people or diverse litestyles,
and a big part of the adjustment in
volves learning to compromise,"
he says.

nore her for several days at a time
and rise early in the morning, otten
waking her while she exercised
and prepared to go running. “After
Winter break I was really dreading
coming back, but i knew that it
would only be tor one more
semester, and it was the only time
I would have to room with her.”
She advises. however. that new
students should "remember it’s

each floor member dressed and
acted like her roommate. “It was a
form of role playing, with each
roommate exaggerating the quirks
of the other," observes Wilson. The
study break was a success because
“when I spoke to them the next day
they agreed that it had helped
them understand each other bet-

Next iee . one (if the largest

Ten month in the planning and at
an estimai ~d cost or more than
$10,000. thi international con-
lerence will attempt to cover the
major probl ms involved with the
re-uniticati n of Taiwan and
Mainland Ch. ia

The list ol p rticipants reads like

Among the most lamous leer
turers are economist» Dwight
Perkins, director of the Harvard
Institute for International
Development; political scientist
Harry Harding, senior fellow with
the Brookings Institute; historian
Ying-shih Yu, currently a pro-
fessopol Princeton; and Nicholas
Riegg, a member of the us. State
Department's Planning and
Economic Analysis start.

Protessor of history Andrew

. Hsieh proposed the conference last

year because he felt reuniﬁcation
to he of pressing importance to the
Chinese people on both sides at the
Taiwan straits.

Mainland China leader Deng
Xiaoping has repeatedly expressed
his desire to extend to Taiwan the
“one country, two system" policy
that will explain Hong Kong’s con-
tinued capitalism after it becomes
part or the People's Republic of
China in X997. Although Taiwan has
expressed little more than distrust
toward the Communism, last year
President Chiang Ching-kuo
delivered a major address on the
subject: copies of the address are
being distributed worldwide,

“They [Taiwan] agreed to come
over the phone,” Hsieh said. “Then
Mr. Moyer and I sent them a lor-
mal invitation - a letter 7 in
December."

According to Hsiéh, Taiwan ige
noted the letter until June. “They

in the invitation it was said that
the college, “consistent with the
foreign policy at the United states,
will not be able to give status to the
Republic ot China during the Con-
ference.” In other words, their
representatives would be listed as
from “Taiwan" rather than (rpm
the “Republic of China.”

l-lsieh said that Taiwan objected
“They lelt put olt. They felt we
politicized (the conference) too
much. But Mr. Moyer and I don't
believe that they ever wanted to
come.

”I’m sorry Taiwan pulled out at
the last minute atter they had
agreed to come, but Hungdah Chiu
has really close relations with
Taiwan. What he says is what
Taiwan would say."

Chin, a law protessor trcrn the
university of Maryland, is known
in Chinese circles as a
‘jspokesmanh for. Taiwan in the
us. according to one major

Taiwanese newspaper.

“We didn' ave any trouble,"
Hsieh said. “ irst of all, they all
knew about Grinnell’s reputation.
Secondly, once you get one lamous
person coming, the others say ‘It
he’s doing it, I’ll do itl’ And it's a
very interesting topic.”

Grinneu has already received
advance publicity in national and
Chinese newspapers. Many jour—
nalists are expected to attend the
conterence, including represen-
tatives from 3 Shanghai
newspaper, the Des Moines
Register, and W0! radio,

The conference was coordinated
by Hsieh for the CowleSAKruidenier

by Wayne Moyer for the Rnsenfield
