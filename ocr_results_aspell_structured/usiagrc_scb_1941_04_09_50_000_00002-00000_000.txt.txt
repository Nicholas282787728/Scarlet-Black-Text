L .In the Home Stretch.

We’ve almost had our say and when next
week r lls around, the Scarlet and Black
kqeys will be unlocking doors for somebody
e se.

For Saturday morning nine persons, in-
cluding five‘ students, three faculty mem,
bers, and one member of the administration,
will elect a new editor of the Scarlet and
Black The paper goes out of our hands into
those of another. With it carries on the
tradition that Gl‘innell‘s newspaper is a stu-
dent newspaper, rather than an organ of the
administration in which students do the
dirty work, And that is how it should be

In the final analysis nobody, except the
student body, can censor the Scarlet and
Black. No faculty member, officer of the
administration, or trustee of this college
can say what will or what will not go into

GRINNELL SCARLET AND BLACK

This is said ill no belligerent
tone, but merely states a fact. The only
time the Scarlet and Black can be gagged
is when tlle studcnts on the Board of Publi-
cations votc away their freedom of the
press. And that, too, is as it should be.

the paper.

nobody except students can
name the coming editor of the Scarlet and
Black. The facility and administration hold
four votes, but the student body claims the
controllingr I'ive. After eligibility rules have
been passed by candidates, the students
pick the editor. Nobody can say differently.

While this is the legal status and it is
all excellent thing that Glinnell recognizes
these rights, especially ill times like these,
it lnust not be forgotten by the editors of
the student paper and the students theme
selves that it is their duty to publish a
paper that is ill the best interests to theme
selh'es and the college It should not be for-
gotten that the freedom of the press u 5
obtained on‘the theory that it was a priv-
ilege granted to the press because the
Fourth Estate was expected to support what
was best for the general welfare of the peo—
ple.

Similarly,

The Scarlet and Black is owned by the
Grinnell Student Publishing Co., a firm in-
corporated in the state of Iowa As such, it
holds complete power over the editorial,
business, and financial policles of the Scarlet
and Black. But the directors of 'Jlle corpora-
tioll compose the Board of Publications, and
the students hold the balance of power.
They continue to hold that balance of power
until they themselves vote it away.

The future of Grinnell journalism is at a
cross-roads. With the changes ill the cur-
riculum in general and the journalism de—
partment in particular, there has been
some slackening in student participation on
the papelz However, under the new cur—
riculum, there still are journalism courses
and it will still be possible to obtain a con»
centration in the field of writing.

It is 'ltl‘l this in mind that we ask the
Publicatlons Board to be superesure when
they elect the Scarlet and Black editor for
next year: He will be able to make or break
this llewspnpelz

CRACK-POT

By Ken
Pearce and Mathews

Inadvertently we took in the
latest Andy Hardy picture at the
local cinema recently. We pres
phesy that the only title um
will draw any more boxrcttlcc rc-
Celpts m that series will be “The
Death of Andy Hardy.”

?

The Fublicity department show-
,ed itself unbelievably astute tor
the first time this year when
they got a publicity shot of the
“Job Surveyors” berm-c the trip,
Undoubtedly the omissmn of cyc-
ball luggage sure to follow the
survey makes for better Grillnell
advertisements.

This last year has prepared us
for a revolution at Grinnel] with
the advent Bf Dr. Stevens. We
did not realize its proximity un-
til recently when two Dibble
men were made Hermits.

,

Historian R. H. Norton says
that the difference between man
and animal is that man can CDn-

trol hls instincts through the var»
ious seasons of the yealz That's
debatable when you observe the
new llght which has penetrated
the eyes of the average Grinnell
male with the advent of Spring.

It is appropriate just now to
recall the Words of William Jen—
nings Bryan, “Should America be
endangered, a million men would
leap to arms between dawn and
dusk.” Recently Prof. Lavellmade
a sage 'cddulcn to the phrase:
“What use is that if there arc n0
arms, and what is the sense to
just leaping?" ,

One factor In Grinnell’s curri-
culum, we're sorry to see, escap-
ed the ax‘c when the faculty re-
modeled our educational plan. It
would seem that Grinnell men are
still subnormal enough to War-
rant three years of physical crlu-
cation while men in nearly every
other institution of higher learn-
mg in the country require only
two, Who said Grinnell mch still
maintain “Red Cox‘puscLES”?

q

We are always surprised that
the. unsuccessful Lccguc Board
aspirants are such good Sports
after election. Our oracles report
that the Quad elections are me
essence of “catt'lness” unknown
