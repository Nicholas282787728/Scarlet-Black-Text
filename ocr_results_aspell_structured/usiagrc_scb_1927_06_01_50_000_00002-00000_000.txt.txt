. The alumni are coming back to Gi-innell. “Same old
place," they say, “same old students, same old tricks."
No, Mr. Alumni, you are wrong; you have not been l all
ing the newspapers and magazines; your thirst for know-
ledge has not been retained out in the cold, unhappy
world we hear so much about.

We are a scandalous lot. we or the younger genera:
tion, We have hairless chests, are drunk all the time,
smoke cigarettes incessantly; our girls swear and smoke
and wear scarcely any clothes—haven’t you read about
it“! We have too. We dance well and our coeds have “it."
i suspect ive would even read the tabloids if we could get
them. We have no purpose in life, we are worth nothing
to society when we graduate and when we are in college
we are parasitic nincompoops living on father. It is too
bad, but we are merely the helpless products of a jazz
environment, children of country- club mothers and radio
fathers. Come shed a tear with us.

A STRAIGHT LINE.

Pal-ting advice to seniors ‘ so plentiful during Com»
ulericcment days that any addition to the fatherly warn-
ings, which they receive and do not heed, would be trite
and a waste of paper. Therefore we will let tall a few
pearls for the librar .

This year the entrances to the stack rooms have
been barricaded as though from attack, supposedly for
efficiency's sake. The steps leading downstairs have been
cut off so that traffic could go but one way and but one
possible entrance to the stack rooms was available; and
the door to the stack rooms upstairs has been labelled
“For Libra , Staff Only," Besides being inconvenient.
the arrangement has added to the disconcerting noise in
the library.

For example, suppose a student is studying upstairs
ill the reading room and desires a book from the stacks.
He must walk downstairs, around the tiles and up 8110‘
tlrcr night it his book is on the upper floor. If he could
hat-e made the trip on the same floor he would havc
saved himself time and the other students annoyance at
the clamping of his heels. '

The library is designed for the benefit of the stir
dents. This minor change, the removal of shelves and
restricted passages, would help. We hopeit will be af-
fected by next fall. ,

Administration steadily Building
Up Facilities Which Meet
Needs of Men.

in the past few years the foundation
has been gradually laid for
strengthening oi men’s interests at
Grinneil. This movement had its her
iginrring in the recognition of the fact
that independent coeducational coir
leges, with hardly an exception, have
been experiencing a growing dispror
portion between the number of men
,aod women applying for entrance.

In making a study oi this situation
the Grinnell administration came to
the conclusion that the first step was
the establishing of a system of resi-
dence for men, complete and unified,
together with a plan of selfrgovern-
merit which would throw the largest
possible measure of responsibility on
the men ot the college with the least
possible control from the faculty. Air
though the war interrupted the stendy
progress of this plan, it has
rapid advances since that time. and
the Griunell system of men's balls and
men’. selfrgm‘ernment has been
claimed as ideal, The same plan was

The next step was to organize the
curriculum with particular
to the demands of tile prote. '
to which men enter. This has been

It has always been a fundamental

their own social affairs are becoming
,more characteristic and valuable, and
‘as the old lines of college class spirit
‘telltl to become dimmer and dimmer,
at Grinllell as well as at every other
college in the country, there is evi-
dence of a new alignment which may
turn out to be much more valuable

I.- than class solidarity ever was.

With the establishment of new
scholarships for men, and the promise
of more, it may confidently be expect-
ed that the ideal proportion between
men and women at which Grlnnell
aims will not be long in being realized.
