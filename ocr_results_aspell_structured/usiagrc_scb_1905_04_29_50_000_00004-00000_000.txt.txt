ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEETS:

tlieirschools. and previous etiol'ls at
control have proved inellicient, but ii
the recommendations of this confer-
ence are accepted by Iowa colleges. as
they no doubt will be, an important
advance will have been nude. A per
mnnent board was formed consisting
or a representative oi each college
faculty in the state. This board will
passnpon the eliglbilit)‘ oratheies and
determine the conditions which they
mustmeet. The rules adopted were
practically the some as adopted by the
”Big Nine." altered only to meet con-
ditions here.

The rule for prohibiting one trom
taking part in college athletics who
has received compensation {oratliletic
services called forth the most discus-
SionY but was finally adopted with the
understanding that it shall not be
retroactive. This will prevent pro-
fessional ball playing by students dur-
ing the summer bun by the latter pro-
visions Ames will be allowed to play
their star pitcher, Brown this sea-
son.

By far the most important step tok-
en by the cunference was the adoption
of the rule providing that a. student
must reside at a. college a full year and
do creditable Work in his studies dul'r
ing that, time before being allowed to
compete in atliletim. This will pre-
vent students from coming to school
simply for athletics It is a marked
innovation and will necessarily greatly
raise the standard of lawn collegiate

THE HUMEOLDT SOCIETY.

At the regular meeting of the Hum-
boldt Society, Prolessor Smith read a
paper on the Opera.

The Opera was lirst deﬁned, musr-
cally and dramatically, and its exist-
ence justiﬁed by the history or the
nice. Then the historical evolution
of the Opera. was considered, from its
beginning in tho Florentine Camerata
1595 to its culmination in the music
dramnsm Wagner.‘ Three countries
only, were considered; those which
had a. marked inﬂuence on tha (level-
opement ofthe Opera: Italy, France
and Germany.

The signiﬁcance 0fthe opera atria
(grand opera), opera buﬂ'a (French
operarcomique) and the romantic
opera was considered in all three coun-
tries. Special emphasis was laitl upon
the dramatic principle in Opera, as
enunciated by the leierata in Italy.
by Gluck in France anti by Wagner in
Germany. and attention was called to
[lie extreme Signiﬁcance of the
Romantic Operanl’Auberin France.
and Weber in Germany. Owing to
lack of time the post-Wagnerian opera
composers were not considered.
