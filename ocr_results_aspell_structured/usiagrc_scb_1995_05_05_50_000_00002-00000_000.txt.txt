BURKLEcametoGrinnell in 1957,
and has taught Religious Studies classes
for the past thirty-seven years. He said
that family considerations is his reason
for retiring. Burkle plans to beactive on

course a year. He also has plans to read,
write and “do some heavy

grandparenting.”

Restablishment of the Religious
Studies department (separate from the
Philosophy department) was altiyilight
of Burkle‘s career. However, “it's the
ongoingthingsl'veenjoyed mostdun'ng
my timeathnnell,"hesaid. Long-term
relationships he has formed with stil-
dentsandcolleagues are among Burkle's
most treasured experiences.

WELLBORN taught at Grinnell
between 1958 and 1962, then retumed in
1972 and has retnailled here since then.
Wellbom said his age was his primary
reason for retiring.

During his tenure, Wellbom has
seen ihe college grow in more ways than
one. “The physical facilities are better
than they were," he said. ”There are also
more women and minority faculty now
than when 1 snarled teaching."

Kissane and Atwell will become
Senior Faculty at the end of dis years
Senior Faculty Slams, according to
Kissane, is “a period between full time,
full remuneration service and complete

retirement" The two professors will
continue to work on various projects,
maintain offices on campus and will
continue as advisers to cur-rentadwsees.

A 1952 graduate of Grinnell,
KISSANE has been a faculty member
since 1956. “l’vecnjoyed my quitelong
stint as a teacher, but there are several
otlicrtliitigsl \vantto do and feel [should
set about doing them while I'm still able
to do them to my satisfaction." Kissanc
said of his reason for seeking Senior
Faculty Status.

As Senior Faculty, Kissane will
serve Oil the Public Events Cotniniltce
and work on rescarchand wriungprojcets,
including a collection of pieces he has
written while at Gnnnell that is sched—
tiled to be published by the college next
winter, “It’s difﬁcult to sum up thirty-
ntne years in a couple of sentences," he
said, but he has particularly enjoyed his
many students and colleagues over the
years, he said.

Like most rallies, it is geared
largely toward attracting media atten-
tion to the demonstrators' cause. Zach
Polsky, Vice President of the Campus
Democrats. said that rally organizers
have contactedtheDesMoinesRegis-
ter, the Grinnell Herald Register and
radio station KGRN—AM.

The other purpose of the rally,
however, will be educational ~ an
other reason to Contact as many group
members as possible. Polsky says
that, even if groups don’t want to ofﬁa
eialty corruriit to the rally because the
group does not want to be political,
“we'rehopingtogetsomeofthepeople
in those groupsinvolved onapersonal
level."

With regard to the educational
purpose or the rally, Haney said,
“What I would hope is that everyone

would bring their personal reasons
foropposingtheContractandbeready
to discuss them Finding out why
other people oppose the Contract will
help us better to articulate why we
oppose it." She sald that, even ifshe
has her own reasons for opposing the
contract, dialogue with other oppo-
nents of the Contract and an under»
standing of their positions, is impor-
tant.

“I want to be able to articulate
other people's point of view, and I
want to defeat the entire Contract,
because I think thatjust defeating my

portion is not going to be enough. And
I know that I' 11 never understand eve
erything, but I want to be able to speak
out for other people too, 1 want to feel
like I’m able to support them,“ Haney
said.

As part of that effort, Polsky said,
“We're hoping to have open mike time
for people to talk," He added that
members of the Poweshiek County
Democratic Party have been contacted,
as have otherchaptets of YoungDemo—
crats from around Iowa. in order to
bring in points ofview from outside of
Grinnell,
