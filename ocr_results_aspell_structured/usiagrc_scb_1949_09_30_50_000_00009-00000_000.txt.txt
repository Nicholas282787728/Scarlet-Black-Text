Vei's To Receive
' Firs+ Paymenls
In Early November

The Veterans Administration
today reminded war veterans
students enrolled [or the fall
term at Grinnell that they
should not expect their first
subsistence check until early
November.

1“. E. Wilhelm, finance offl—
cer at the lowa VA office in
Des Moines, explained that

>subsistance checks cannot be
. issued as a payment in advance
‘but are generally payable only
, after the veteran has completed
» a full calendar month of schools
,v ing. As in the past two years,
the iirst check will include pay
ment tor the full month of Des
tober and the latter part of
. September.
. The VA official said he antic—
,ipates no delay in the regular
payment of subsistence allow—
ances even,tliough checks will
go to more than 30,000 exssar-
vicemen in lowa. Some veters
ans, he said, may receive checks
in October but the majority will

be paid about November 1.

Wilhelm advised veterans not
to contact VA about their pay
ments unless they tail to arrive
by early November because
earlier inquiries will only inter—
fere with the huge clerical task
of making payments.

Veterans can help to insure
prompt payments, the VA oiti»
cial said, by keeping VA infor-
med ol any change in their ad
dress.
