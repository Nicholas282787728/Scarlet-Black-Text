RIVA'S VIEW 7

With a few line-up changes, Seam

The Age of Innocence, based on the
Edith Whanon novel and directed by
Martin Scorsese, lS a rare l'tlm. Tremen
dons care and effort went into its making.
The direction, acting, story line, music,
and sets are all extraordinary.

Tire movie is set primarily in New
YorkCllyin the 18703. Newland (Dental
Dny-Lewls),Ellcn(NiichcllePfeiffer)tm<l
May (Winona Ryder) are members of
prestigious families obsessed widt social
status. Newland istorn betwcentwolives.
He can lead an upstanding seetalite life
withall thcrightconnectionswtth Mayor
a life of personal freedom with Ellen, a
rogue indifferent to Socllll convention.
Newland, Ellen. and May are wondrous
characters, so complex and detailed that
they become fully tea] and have Ute
capacity to capture onc's imagination,
even days after seeing the min.

Thel'ilm‘s ﬁftyrttillion dollarbudgct
has bmn put loexccllent use in capturing
every last detail. Scorsese masterfully
captures lhcbcttutyand tic/cadenceof high
society. The bllnrblOOdS have exquisite
clothing, dinner sets, and mansions, yet
they are so bored they have nothing better
