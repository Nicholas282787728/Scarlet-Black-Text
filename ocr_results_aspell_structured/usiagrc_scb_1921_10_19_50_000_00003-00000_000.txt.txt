The tour-th quarter proved to he a
iruitless attempt to score hy both
sides. Prints were exchanged again
and again with neithc side gaining
the advantage. In this pc on Gr nell
pulled a pretty oneside kick which
was run nearly across the Filter line.
However-,‘the referee claimed that the
receiving man was not behind the hall
and would not allow the play. The
ﬁnal few minutes of play was a con—

Diitesluau stars

For Grinnell, Datesman was the out-
standing star of the game. He orohe
up passes, threw runners tor losses
and hrolre up plays around his end
time and again, and incidentally turn—
ed an intercepted pass into the ﬁrst
tally for the Pioneers. lvhltehill also
played in steller fashion until his in
jury lorced him to leave the game.
The Grinnell linesmen also deserve
credit for the way in which they held
their heavier opponents. In spite of
their superior weight, the Washing»
ton team did not seem able to ﬁnd a
weak spot in the Grinnell fore wall.
on the whole the game seemed to he
a.contest between two evenly mntclir
ed teams.

Round About

Dear Willie:
What becomes of the hostess when
she comes to Gi'innell’! What becomes
of the social evenings that. she is in
the habit of extending to her friends

at home? r
’Laining in a parlor as they are at a

Gone, All gone.

Sally—(we‘ll call this eV-hostess
“Sally")—Sally seems to be swallowed
up in the general idea that a good time
consists of dashing lo the movies with
a “date," trotting down town, and, as
a rule, staying at home as little as

'possihle.

The Quadrangle has been so ar-
rangod that Sally may have all the
privileges of a home while she is ex-
posed to education. The cottage par—
lors are there for Sally’s very own
use. The piano, is there to iurnisli
her amusement. The ﬁreplace was,
built so that on a dark, rainy day, she
may telephone Susan and say: "Do
come down to the cottage. There is a
hig ﬁre in the lire-place. Bring your}
knitting and we'll make some tudgel
on my grill. Well, it you’d rather, wel
can pop corn. Hurry up. I’ve some
thing to tell you." Susan and Sally
may spend the darlt, damp atternoon
curled up on the davenport before
the crackling ﬁre instead or weeping
and wailing with homesichness in
their own rooms.

0r, Friday night, they go to the
rep meeting: yell lustily. They meet
a couple or their men triends and in—
istead of strolling around town, or go-
g‘ing to a movie, they take possession
lot the ﬁreplace, piano, ruin their die
gestive organs with some more candy,
'hut enjoy that spirit of tellowship
which only a home. crackling lire and
music can produce,
