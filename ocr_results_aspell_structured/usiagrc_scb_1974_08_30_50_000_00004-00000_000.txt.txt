Caught in the ’
middle: students
and the strike

Amid chides trom graduated Grinneilians, the Grinnell campus
Community finds itself at a loss in the current B & G strike. There is a
cause to be supported, but no one seems to know which way to jump
iirst. The B tit G labor iorce obviously gets the iirst sympathetic nod oi
approvalithey occupy the traditional role oi the underdog. Alter all,
students supported the 1970 B it G tight to gain recognition irom the
college to originally join the teamsters union But something is
missing irom that original fight. The workers no longer just want the
basic right to unionize, they want more mundane demands such as
better wages and benefits irom the college, their employer.

Communications on campus about the strike have necessarily been
vague since the negotiations have been held in a number oi locations
by the iormal representatives irom both sides. A basic rule in such
negotiations is the avoidance oi direct conirontation so that personal
pressures and ieelings are kept to a minimum. Uniortunately this
built-in guard compounds any rumors‘by keeping the bargaining
sessions under tight iiiiormation bans. The public must wait until the
negotiations reach a iocused state beiore the demands can be released
publicly, ii at all. But until this state is reached, rumors can neither be
denied not altirmed

Several students have taken up the cause oi the workers and have
spent hours trying to iigure out the best demonstration oi student
support. They have been able to identity with the workers particularly
in the area oi strike payiEt at G strikers only receive $25 per week
instead oi their accustomed wages. The iact is a hard economic one to
race in today’s inﬂationrriddled society and seems inconceivable to
many oi Grinnell's aiiluent members. Yet the college has its
problems, too.

Much work remains uniinislied or unattended while the striking
workers lounge in their lawn chairs around the campus, While no one
is accusing anyone else oi wanting to prolong the strike, the college
must use any and all legal tactics to iuliill their obligation to maintain
and run this liberal arts institution. That obligation includes eniorcing
deliveries made by nonunion drivers across picket lines as well as
hiring specialists to complete necessary and complicated repairs or
installations.

Part oi the workers' lost wages will have to be spent to pay tor the
special, unbudgeted labor contracts Another per cent will be lost in
overtime wages which the B 8: G workers will earn just to restore the
college to its normal iunctioning level. The losses on both sides will
never be iuliy replaced even it the drawiiout bargaining battle was
settled immediately

The basic argument seems to center around the teamsters' tun-
damental belief that the Grinnell unit deserves a better break than
what the college has ottered ior its members to survive the cost oi
living. Contracts proposed by the union compare iavorably with others
settled by highrproiit corporations. The college, on the other hand,
must also try to survive the cost oi living. its product, the student,
cannotbe sold ior a higher price to oiiset an expensive labor contract.
It has only a iixed income which depends on giits and tuition rates to
compensate tor the rising costs it must also endure, Since giits to the
institution are down due to the economy, tuition stands as the lonely
choice ior iuture increases. But college oiiicials realize that they have
stretched that iigure almost beyond endurance, and are most relucr
tant to increase costs again They iully acknowledge that they could
place Grinnell out oi existence ii the costs rise much higher.

So the strike continues, out to whose advantage? The college is
unhappy, the workers are unhappy, and the students are unhappy. it
students want to become actively involved, they should know who will
ultimately bear the iinancial cost oi an uniniormed but honest
mistake—themselves

Kolber: Views Meditation

To the College Community:

l urge all members of the
Grinnell College Community to
consider the benefits which
transcendental meditation (TM)
might oiier them

TM is not a religion or
philosophy, nor does its practice
involve attitudes in any sense. it is
a natural, automatic, effortless
technique. All that you need is 20
spare minutes and a little quietr
ness. Unlike many types oi yoga, it
is purely mental. Research at over
30 mayor international institutions,
including U.C,L.A., Harvard
Medical School, The Max Planck
institute, the Institute [or
Behavioral Research. and
numerous others whose names I
will be happy to provide. has
decisively established clear
beneiits ior peopie who.regularly
practice this technique. These
beneiits are both psychological and
physiological. They have been
cxtensively delineated in such
publications as Scientific
American, The American Journal
of Physiology, The Journal oi
Transpersonal Psychology, New
Scientist, The Lancet, Science
Digest, Journal of the American
Medical Association, and a host oi
others.

The benefits include: a level at
rest which is twice as deep as
sleep, tremendous reduction of
anxiety, more resistance to stress
situations, increased perceptual
powers, improved memory, im-
proved seli-integration and self-
actualization, reduced need for
drugs to solve problems, and a
wide variety of others

Although TM arises out of a
system at indian philosophy
thousands oi years old, l wish
again to emphasize that it no more
requires a philosophy than taking a

Tederman: Students can aid

TO THE EDITOR:

l have talked to many students
who are concerned about the B & G
workers and their need ior greater
wages and better working cone
ditions. Many oi these students
have been, and are, discussing
ways in which they can help the B
8: G workers in their negotiations
with the College.

Ii students are truthiully con-
cerned about B or G working
conditions, i would like to point. out
a tew ways that they can improve
these conditions once the strike has
ended.

hallways atter your parties, rather

walk. it does diiier item the
various other methods oi
meditation oi which i am aware. it
has been taught to over 500,000
Americans, including many

eminent scientists, members oi the
clergy, businesspeople, educators,
politicians, and military people.
But such is its simplicity that it can
successtully be taught to children.
Further, about 7 per cent of the
Grinnell student body had learned
it as oi last year. Again, I will be
happy to provide names

TM is taught through the Inc
ternational Meditation Society and
aiiiliated groups, all oi them
chartered as non-proiit by the U.S.
Government. There is a fee for
learning TM, but it goes to support
the training oi more teachers,
paying the living expenses oi those
now teaching, and building
universities +(you probably read
of the negotiations to acquire
Parsons College in the Des Moines
Register), The founder and

director of the movement,

What i do know is that it has done
tremendous good for me as well as
many people i know with no
noticeable negative effects. Also,
the wide scientific evidence
suggests that it has salubrlous
eiiects tor the vast majority oi
people. introductory lectures are
free. They will be oIIered on
campus several times this year. 1..

nothing to lost but about an hour.
But you may have a tremendous
amount to gain.

which includes optional additional
training that might be desired to

Used bookstore open

ment Association Dan Stein will
soon open the Used Book store
located in Gardner lounge, unr

Stein attributed his willingness
to operate the facility to his
discovery that students had no.
other organized access to used
textbooks. He stated that the lack

if you would ask the

on how you might help them. If
your intentions are sincere, I hope
that you will accept some oi the.
suggestions listed above and carry
them out during the Coming year.
