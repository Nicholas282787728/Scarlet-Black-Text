Grinnell Tennis Hopes for Year Hence

Tennis prospects have brightened
considerably since the of
John L. Tatom, who has just come

arrival

from Des Moines after a summer—of

successes in various tournam'ehts.
Tatom Will be rated as a senior here
and since he is ineligihle for varsity
athletics this year he will treat Grln-
nell at various time during the year
with exhibition matches. Tatom and
Coggeshall played together this sum-
mer and that Tatum was able to
hold his own against the collegiate
ace.
Holds Many Titles

Tatom, who spent last year at
John Fletchers. WES encouraged to
come to Grinnell hy Cnggeshall when
they met this summer in Des Moines
at the Iowa state tournaments. Ta-
tom is from Cebu Cebu which is a
Well known athletic center in the
Philippine Islands. He attended the
Sillihm institute in Manila for his
ﬁrst two years of college work. Here
he distinguished himself in all
branches of athletics.

The record of his recent successes
in tennis tournaments is astounding.

singles championship, and paired
with B. J. carney came through by
a win over Coggeshall and stutz in
the finals to win the doubles chem-
pionship of the Des Moines Tennis
club. Not contented with that Tatom
put another feather in his cap when
he took the Des Moines Champion-
ship.

Irrstate Champ

His greatest accomplishment lies
in his Winning of the Til-State
championship which took place in
Omaha this last July. Here he Won
the finals from Robbins, Iowa state
tennis captain, in one of the most
thrilling matches that has ever been
witnessed in the Middle West. Tatom
Won the first set 6-1, lost the second
and third sets 6-4, 7-5, evened the
match by taking the fourth 6-3, and
then in that last gruelling set,
which brought out Tstom’s fighting
spirit and determination, he came

 

through to win after being down 5-2
with the count of forty fifteen
against him. There were no less than
seven mhtch points in that set and
each time Tatum with a beautiful
placement shots warded off what
seemed to he inevitable defeat, tak-
ing the deciding set 75.
Also Truck Man
Gordon Lum, Chinese Olympic ten-
nis star after returning from the
Philippine islands where he had par-
ticipated in tennis matches, made the
remark that Tatum had the finest
form of any young tennis player in
the world and that within the next
few years Tatcm would become one
of the greatest players in the world.
Some of the other tournaments he
has won are: The Phillippine Pacific
Coast Championship, and the Golden
Gate Championship in San Francisco.
He is not only a tennis player of
note hut is also a track man. He took
