This Is the lirstoi what will bean
occasional series oi short articles
highlighting parts oi the campus
that are. aesthetically. extremely
unsuccessiul. Today, let‘s examine
what has been done to Carnegie.

Now, i certainly wouldnt claim

that Carrie ex‘las eve

cant a war of archite-

has some nice details, and pro
bahly had a lot more nice details
beiore they cut it all to pieces and
laid out the linoleum. As it is the
building has the appearance oi
having been gutted.

However, one really nice detail
remains 4 the skylight above the
top ilight oi stairs. When
operative, the skylight must have
brought a lotoi good natural light
into a building that is now very
dark and dreary. It's hard to notice
the skylight today, covered as it is
by a combination oi sound-prooimg
tiles and the usual dropped-ceiling
panels. [won’t go on about how the
skylight's graceiul architectural
details are ill-served by the
bastard space that now surrounds
it: Carnegie ,is, an ohviolb l
ch ectural messn

One can only hope ha when
Carnegie is renovated its Beaux
Arts details will be respcc t.ed My

fear is that every inch of floor
space that can possibly be
carpeted WlLL get carpeted.
Careful architectural detailing will
not be recreated or preserved [In
stead cheap wooden moldings will
be put in the building and will be
painted pink or green. Or else
hose cheap moldings will be given
a clear, thin varnish like that used
in Burling. The varnish quickly
wears off and leaves the wood
grey, dark, and ugly, This has
already happened in parts or the

, renovated Burling. But by the time

the whole or Burling looks like
crap, it'll be time to rip everything
out and renovate again. Its the
Bic disposable lighter school oi ar-
”Chillioture -, .. .

is that what we really want ior
Carnegie? Let 5 hope that people
have more sense than that. Like all
buildings owned by the college,
Carnegie should be renovated, or
rather restored. with lasting
values and craitsmanship in mind,
I don‘t want to sound like a mor-
tuary ad but we should build for
eternity That was not done with

.2 lb last umpteen desecrations or

violations oi Carnegie And what is
the result? A building where les
Beaux Arts become the bizarre,

Desert Hearts

by Vincent Prusser

“Desert Hearts" is 8 wells
cratted but finally unsatisiying
movie. While it lacks some of the
flaws of “Parting Glances" (such
as intermittent overrcutesiness
and occasional bizarre and map
propriate allegorical imagery), it
also lacks that films very real
charms. “Parting Glances" has
entertaining, interesting
characters who convince us of
their love for each other. ”Desert
Hearts" seems somehow false and
empty.

Part oi the problem is Helen
Shaver. she plays Vivian Bell, an
uptight East Coast professor who
goes to Nevada in the 19505 to fulfill
the slxcweek residency require-
ment to get a divorce. While there,
she stays with a widow, Frances
Parker tAudra Lindley), who has a
lovely daughter, Cay Rivvers
(Patricia Charbonneau), Well, this
young lady is randy as all-get-out,
and the minute she sees the 'rigid,
inhibited professor, she just. she
just, WANTS her.

l-lelen Shaver is never anything
but stilted. it‘s as if her every man»
nerism is saying, “Look at me. I'm
acting. .l have such iine
technique." Charbonneau plays a
completely unbelievable
character. If she does, indeed. feel
love and compassion, it doesn't
come across. Her eyes are too iix-
ed and drugged looking the emp~
ty, soulless eyes ot a seductress or

,voyeur. lNeither the East Coast

prig nor the predator convinces

The plot is also unbelievable ‘

Everyone seems aware that Char-
bonneau is aggressively lesbian,
but once she seduces Shaver, the
mother gets angry and yells at
Shaver as if it‘s Shaver's fault. on
the one hand, characters are Lln'
naturally sophisticated and accep~
ting. On the other hand, they are
too unaccepting. i suppose it could
happen that way, but it seems to be
pain ior pain's sake, without any
real message or psychological
truth to it.

It's a good movie, and a wells

wrought movie. worth seeing, but
it surprises me that it was directed
by a woman tDonna Deitch), I say
this becausc the film, while patting
itself on the back for “breaking
new ground" by depicting love bet-
ween two women, does not actually
create a convincing new iiim
genre. Rather than showing two
women who are equals, or who are
mutually supportive and mutually
reliant the film resorts to the

Parting Glances

by Matt Macho

“Parting Glances" is one of two
iilms scheduled as a sort oi prelude
to Grinnell Gay Pride Week, which
oiiicially begins next week and
really gets cooking with events and
speakers next weekend. No doubt
latent homophobia will keep much
or the campus trom seeing either
this filln or its counterpart,
“Desert Hearts.” This is unfor-
tunate, since both are interesting,
unique iilms.

“Parting Glances" is a lively.
upbeat iilm with a style that accen»
tuates is sleek, handsome look
trarely seen in a iilm oi such low
budgeti. The passionate reunion or
lovers/roommates Michael
lRiChard Ganoungt and Robert
tJohn Bolger) turns into an extend-
ed round of happy iarewell parties,
as Robert has been‘ transferred to
Airica by his employer.

while the film possesses a great
new style, the characters at times
seem to iollow a parade oi rather

“conventional stereotypesf‘ 'A‘s ‘i-e- " ThinMan

cent as this ﬁlm is (1936), many
members of the Grinnell audience,
at least, will think we've come a
long way since then, The poweriul,
anarchic presence oi Steve
Buscemi who plays Nick, a musi-
cian dying of AIDS, pus a lot of
depth and interest into the film.

There aren't too many films
around that deal with gay issues.
let alone iilms oi this quality.
”Parting Giances" definitely
merits a look-see.

The Thin Man

by Matt Macho

A whole series of “Thin Man”
movies were made in the ‘405;
thme who have never seen one are
in for a treat. The combination of
an interesting murder-mystery
plot with funny dialogue and arnaz-
ing chemistry between co-slars
William Powell and Myrna Loy as
privalereyes Nick and Nora
Charles results in consistently
good films. Oh, and of course
there’s also their dog, Asia.

The plot is pretty basic murder»
mystery tare, but delivered with
such wit and style as to make ror
great fun. This series was the in-
spiration tor the popular television
show, “Moonlighting,” but Cybil
Shepherd and Bruce Willis are
pretty dull sturt compared to the
originals. Powell and boy. Miss»
ing, of course, is “Moonlighting” ’s
blatant sexual innuendo (this is the
’405, after all), but then that’s no
loss.

They don‘ I make films like “The
an‘yr’nore. indeed, they
didnt make too many even way
back when. Come and see “The
Thin Man" this weekend; you’re
sure to enjoy yourself.

Saturday, April 9, 10 pm, South
Lounge.
