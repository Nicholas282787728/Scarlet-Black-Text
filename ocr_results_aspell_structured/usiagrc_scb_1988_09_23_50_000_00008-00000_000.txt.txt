We'll Keep You Posted

"SGA" and "communication"
are two words that have rarely
been associated together. That
was especially apparent in last
spring's elections. A recurrent
theme in almost every candidate's
campaign was the promise to
"improve communication." Ac-
cording to President Drake, that:
nothing new. When he ran for

Rob Killion

SGA President during the mid
fifties he. too promised to
improve communication among
the student body. faculty, and
administration. Ah, the irony of
life.

 

 

 

 

In the past few years,
senators‘ Joint Board minutes and
cabinet office hours have served
as the main line of
communication from SGA to the
student body. Occasionally SGA
would also sponsor an open
fonrm if a major campus issue
arose. This year we're trying a
few different methods. For
example, the column you‘re read-
ing now will appear in the
Scarlet and Black every
week; Greg Evans and I will take
turns authoring it. We'll use it
to detail some of the projects
we're working on this year.

Steve Sturgeon has agreed to
broadcast an "SGA news" show
on KDIC every Monday at 6
PM. He'll be reporting on Joint
Board, faculty news, cabinet
proposals. and any other SGA-
relatod matters of intcrcst to the
campus. In addition, we want
campus groups to know that
they're welcome to contact Steve
about information they want
broadcast (e.g. upcoming events,
appeals for members). Slcvc‘s
box is 14-11 and his number is
X3283.

At Dave Ioncs' suggestion, I
scheduled a series of 10 open [0.
rums over the summer that deal
with subjects such as financial
aid, women's and gender studies,
the library, the bookstore, dining

services. and minority recruiting
(faculty, staff, and student). With
the Director of Minority Affairs'
permission. we scheduled the
minority recruiting open forum
during Black History Month.
There will be five open forums
each semester spaced
approximately three to four
weeks apart. Greg's new
"President‘s Committee" will do
the publicity for each forum. If
any unforeseen campus issues
arise (as was the case with
lMonday's forum on rape and
harassment) either a new forum
can be scheduled or the topic of a
scheduled one can be changed.
This summer I also compiled
an “SGA Handbook." It a com-
prehensive but concise look at
exactly what SGA does. Cabinet
members from last year and this
year wrote about two-thirds of the
selections; I wrote the last third.

 

Hopefully by tho end or the
month it will be laid out and
ready for print. Every student will
have a copy.

10c Lewis and Kae Bendixcn,
the student treasurers, wrote an
article two weeks ago in the
Scarlet and Black explaining
hall finances. Last week they
sent a memo to every SA, HAC,
and House Coordinator detailing
how to use the treasurers ofﬁce.
In addition, the letter asked them
to post a running total of floor,
hall, or house expenses so it will
be available to all of you. And
as usual, any student can come in
during Joe or Kac's office hours

and ask them questions. No
SGA financial information is
secret

As the semester progresses, I
think the campus will find that
SGA's commitment to
communication is consistent.
For example. The Films and
Concerts Committees will be
taking surveys each semester to
help them make their booking
decisions. When the trustees are
coming to campus, Greg and I
will contact both student groups
and the campus as a whole so we
can convey campus sentiments as
accurately as possible. And of
course, the cabinet office hours
and Joint Board minutes will still
be around. Cathy Baldwin is
working with the senators to
make their minutes more detailed.
The 10 cabinet members are
keeping a total of around 50
scheduled ofﬁce hours per week
spanning every day oi the week.

From here on it‘s up to all of
you. We have tried to open as
many blanchcs of communication
as possible, but for any of this to
work the campus has to care.
Communication is impossible if
one party is apathetic. It you
need information, take the time
to ﬁnd out. It's out there it you
want it.

action will raise both awareness
and activism on this important
issue on our campus. Conccmctl
students should support Students

and make thcir views for
divestment and against apartheid
known to the Trustees when they
come to campus this October.

The Human Element

I always hated shopping with
my parents. especially for school
clothes. But like any other kid, I
would settle on a pair of shoes or
a hat and wear it to death. . .

Exasperated, Mom jerks my
arm. She’s never been much for
these "Back to School Sale"
crowds. "C'mon, we're not

staying here all day!" I drag my
feet, Mom lets go, and Dads ce-
ment fingers replace her
- impatient holdrcrushing down on
my skinny shoulder, biting
through the frecklcd skin and
stringy musclc--suaight to bone.

I buckle under his persuasive
vise-grip. wincing, the tears
rising in my eyes. “Wait, wait,
wait, wait." I plead. He relaxes
his hold. . .slightly. Whining
works sometimes.

So many choices! I feel
overwhelmed by indecision and
the towering stacks of beautiful,
fresh, unabused writing tablets. I
vigorously wiggle my foreﬁnger
in my car, which helps me to
think. It has to be the perfect
m to start the year off right.
This is Serious Business.

Naturally, I select a thick Big
Chief. Morn looks away and
rolls her eyes. "Are you sure?"
Dad asks. I look up at him
grimly, like I do every year.

"Big Chief, Dad. It‘s gotta

I have to own it. Dad says I
need a new coat anyway; my old
onc's getting ragged.

I carry the box. which has
laid across my knees the entire
ride home, into the house.
Immediately, I open the package
and draw the coat out.

Yeah, it’s perfect.

\ I slip into it and announce
that I'm going across the street to
the Sorcnson's to play football.
"In that?" Morn asks. "Isn‘t it a
little warm out?"

"Nah, it's just right. Seeya!"

The screen door slams behind
me as I step out into the 85
degree weather. In my brand-new
down coat. It's dark blue. with
puffy sleeves and a stuffed chest.

 

TEACH.

The pockets are deep, and there‘s
a hood which rolls up and zips
into the collar. I button up, all
the way to my flushed neck. It's
a great ﬁt.

Steve answers the doorbell,
ball already in hand, and steps out
on the concrete porch. He doesn‘t
notice, but I don't care. The
focus is football this afternoon.
Torn comes sprinting from
around the comer. "What's the
coat for," he asks, panting hard.

"I got it today," I say. He
seems to accept that.

By the time the other five arr
rive, the coat is forgotten, even
by me. I hardly feel the Wannlh.
Play begins on the front lawn,
with the boundaries being the
concrete driveway and the space
between the Mitchell's two
shnibs.

The game is fast-paced,
driving from one end of the yard
to the other. Tackling is
comfortable given the extra
padding of my NEW coat. The
intensity escalates, until the
game finally dissolves into a free-
forrall, totally crazy tackling of
six on two or seven on one.
"Smear the Queeril" someone
yells, and Brian jumps up with
the ball under his arm and bolts.
We all pursue. screaming
gutturally, and pounce. The ball
pops free and I scoop it up,
peeling off the pack. They’re on
me within seconds. "Pile out!" I
fight for air somewhere under the
smothering heap of wriggling
bodies. Pushing and kicking,
heat, sweat-Tm twisted and con-
torted with the other tangled
limbs, with the weight of the
others forcing my face into the
grass. Sol pass out.

"He's all right," Dad says,
kneeling over me. "Just got
over-healed wearing his coat." He
holds it up. Steve's mom and all
of the other guys are towering far
above me, silouettes against the
blue sky. The game is over now,
spoiled. "We'll play tomorrow,“
Jason says. The others agree, and
the group fragments, each
heading home. Dad guides me
across the street because I'm still
woozy. The new coat is tucked
under his other am.

That night, I wear it to bed.
