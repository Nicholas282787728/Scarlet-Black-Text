Homecoming into a defeat.

The Pioneers suffered no serious injuries in the Carleton defeat, Coach Peterson said
that the boys gave everything- that they had at Cornell and came within two minutes of
beating the Knights. The difference in the game can be accounted for in breaks. It seemed

as it Grinncll got all the bad
ones. Pete went on to Say that
there is no one that should be

A dependable performer at a
guard post, Chuck is in his sec—
ond season as a Pioneer regular
and is one oi those rare individ-
uals who hasn't missed a game
because of illne or _injury. He
is a line backel on defense. He
believes that the success of the
1957 Pioneers will be due in
some measure to the inﬂuence
of ﬂu and injuries, He also
mentioned that the experience
gathered from last season has
been an important part of the
development of the Pioneers
this season.

Chuck has noticed that the
caliber oi football in the Mid-
west coniereiice is improving.
“St. our always seemed to
have an edge on the entire
coniercnoc." he said, “but
this tell they are discovering
that the rest oi the clubs are
catching up with them."
