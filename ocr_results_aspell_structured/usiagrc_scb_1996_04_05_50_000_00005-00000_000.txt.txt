about faith. Havingspentap<
pro. mately 96 hours “going Grey—

had plenty oftime to pontler not only
the quadrillion reasons why I should
never ride the bus again, but about
the coming anaster, and my person—
al spirituality. The ride from Minna.

and I was able to gCt some sleep
before one of my fellow travelers be,

origin of HIV/AIDS somewhere in
North Dakota. It was obVious tome

about virology, nor did she not pos—

To begin ivith, she believed it ex.
tremely suspicious that HIV just
“showed up fifteen years ago", lead<

was engineered to target prostitutes,
homosexuals, and IV drug users, thus
enabling the us. government to rid
itself of these categories of undesir—
ables. Next, she expressed angerand
frustration that, despite vast phar.

the leap from treatment to cute.

1 admit that when she began
outlininghetposirion, relyingon the
moVie Outbreak as a primary source,
that I rolled my eyes and attempted
to go back to sleep. However, as she
wound up her initial arguments,
which to be fair were well-reasoned
considering her probable lack ofsec—
ondary education, my attention was
peaked when she revealed a crucial
bit of information that offered in
sight into her thought processes. Her
mothet was HIV positive, Immedi—

I never did catch, ceased to be a

comfortable balance between maxi—

Many times I thought that ifl had
someone to blame for it all that may-

Accordingly I went through the list:
it’s God's fault, it’s the tobacco in—

nobody’s fault, It just happened.

Setting out to comfort the ﬂmlcfé‘d

BY BRUCE FRIEDRICH

I hope everyone had a wonder
ful and relaxing break. I used my
break to catch up on work and sleep,
both ofwhlch I had neglected. Also,
my dearest inend and compatriot
visited (or 8 days She perused my
columns and features’ sections, and
the conversation wentsomerhinglike
this:

"Uh, Bruce, what exactly are
you trying to accomplish with this
stain" Excuse me? “What are you
trying to do” I’m trying to convince
people not to be stockbrokers, I re«
plied whimsically. “Fine, but really,
what is your goal? ltyou could have
everything you wanted with these
columns,what\vouldhappenl"\X/ell,
I replied, I want Otinnellians to un»
derstand poverty in the world and
how we all contribute to It, I want
them to understand that global and
domestic poverty have clear struc«
tural causes

“Everyone knows that. People
know that millions of people starve
to death every year. This isn’t news,”
Then why don't we do something
aboutit?“People feeldisempowered."
Well, I truly believe that we allneed
to invest our whole lives in the alle-
viationof human suffering. I want to
convince people that we can all make
a difference. Ion Sobtlno doesn’t see
how we can be human in the world
today if opposition to this growing
poverty and oppression is not the
fundamental concern of our lives.
How can we say we belong to hu—
manity if we neglect the 1.3 billion
who are presently starvmg to death,
thezo.4o millionwhodieeveryyear.’

interests to oppress masses of people
in the interest of lower production
costs (newspeak: “free markets”).
This is something we should all be
righting vvith all our energy.

Martin Luther King spelled
out and condemned these very rela—
tionships inthesc very terms in 1967.
He declared that “the United States
is on the wrong side ofa world revo-
lution,” Unfortunately, the situation
has not changed. I want us all to
choose to be on the right side ofthis
revolution.

Gandhi talked about the
world as a dining room table: There
are ten people around the table. One
of them is eating well, has plenteous
access to clean water, and probably
has health care. That is those of us
here atGrlnnell.We representtouglr
ly 600 million people. One ofthe ten
people is eating pretty well, probably
has access to clean water, mighthave
health care, probably has almost
nothing in the bank (This is 600
million more people).

The next 6 people represent
the 3.5 billion people who are living
hand<to>mouth in the developing
world, These people make much of
ourclothing andharvest much of our
food for between 6 cents and 2 dol—
lars per hour. They have no unions,
no healthcare.Theirworkingcondi—
tians are abysmal, “living hell“ ac«
cording to one worker. Half of them
have no access to potable water. More
than halfofthem earn less than$500
per year, They are struggling desper—
ately not to fall into the final Calegor
ry

The last two people at the
table represent the 1.3 billion people
who the UN says are presently in
“dire poycrry." These two people are
not eating They do not consume

This is reality.

“But statistics don’t move peo—

day, but few people will devote their

lives to peace and justice for a numr
ber.”

ButthiststealityThese are peo.

are dying because, as George Bush
told the Cairo conference in 1991,
“Our lifestyles are not open to nego-
tiation." The us government works
to perpetuate these grave injustices.
We sell more than 70% of all weap—
ons sold to the developing world,
This is not a secret. We sell these

l‘Humor, Bruce! You’re hilarir
ous in a warped way. Your columns
are so humorless, You need more
humor.”MartinLutherKingsaidthat
without a sense of humor, he would
have committed suicide early in the
struggle. Obviously, asense of humor
is essential. I try to keep perspective.
I make a point of laughing aloud
every day. I think beingplayful makes
one a playful person. but in this for—
mat, there is limited space, lcan’t use
up space telling jokes or inserting
puns, “It might convince people to
read your articla."
