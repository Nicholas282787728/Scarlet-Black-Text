A GOOD Tum.

0n the evening or October 31 the senior class uns
aiiiinously passed a resolution, declaring that the Grin-
ncll chapel and vcspcr services are worthy oi the sup-
port of all students, and pledging the senior class to
encourage chapel attendance. This, the sentiment or
Grinnell seniors, seems to us to be particularly worthy,
and to new three-fold signiiicance.

First, this is a declaration hascd on experience:
hence, it may be taken as authoritative. The men and
women who unaniiiiousiy decided in iavor or the spirit
and tunctioii oi the services are best qualified oi all
the undergraduates to judge. Their reflection comes
as the direct result. oi over three- ycai-s' observation to
judge. Tlicir rerlcction comes as the direct result of
over three years ohscruaiion oi Gl'lllllell lilo, 'l‘llus,
uhch tlioy speak or “the spirit it (chapel) aims to pro-
mote," they exhibit an understanding or the primary
objectives oi Grinncll, and realize that chancl and yes
poi-s contribute materially toward these ends.

It rollows that such a pledge or support as this
should bear weight on the campus. Logically, the sen—
ior class should lead the general body oi undergradu-
ates in constructive thought and action. Thls leader
ship should. and doubtless will be4influclltlill iii the
solution of Grinilell’s chapcl nttcnd‘a‘ncc problem. it
should mean that senior attendance will he more regur
hir, and should mean that chapel will be more highly
rcgurdcd by all thinking students,

Finally, tlus declaration of support is obviously a
credit to the seniors or Grmnell. it is constructive ac-
tioii. designed ,to “do a good turn" icr Grinncll.
iust exercise of the prerogatives or seniorhood. The
mere voicing or the sentiment or the class in the words
or support is worth in itsclr; inlrilling tho pledge is
even worthic We are reminded or the words or an
unknown writel: “I shall pass through this world but
once. Any good, thererorc, that 1 can do, or any kind-
l'less that i can show to any human hoiug, let me not
delay or neglect it, lor I shall not pass this way again,"
The class or 1929 possesses something or thc spirit oi
this passage.
