The program opened with “0, Had 1
Johns Lyrc." by Hanocl, in which
iiiss Downing showed a. splendid tcch—
nique. IL was followed by thc inclo—
dim “Wore My Song with Wings
1” ded," by Hahn, tlohghtinl in its
pinllissimo effect.

One of the most ﬁnished number:
was M or s "Non so pin 005:! Sun,”
where [he . more good tonc color and
style we c especially \islble. Tllc
plaintive “The Dew is Sparkling.” lry
Rubinstein, was sympathetically inter»
m-cted.

The two songs by Liza Lehman wcrc
most or stically done. "Lullothyn was
sung cares ugly and in clear toncs,
wllilc "Sonic Charmer“ was hrilliont
and in oolorntnra stylc.

“Mignon," by (l'HOI‘ﬂclot, and “01" ‘

plious and Hi Lute," liy ilanney, two
charming l -lcs, contra ed with the
romantic "Life and Dezttll” by Color
ige—Taylor, and "Birthday,’ by Whit-
ing. In both Iypcs Miss Downing
showed her nl) ty to rail her mood
as the selection demanded.

by Winifred Allny, Monday evening, in
which she was a sisted by Mrs. Dot-

splendid voice control made her pro-
gram especially pleasing. In all her
songs Miss Almy’s range was most
noticeable, combining the full and
round upper tones with the clear
lower ones.

In the ﬁrst group, “The Alpine
Rose,” by Parker, was the most ep-
Dealing. The two lyrics, “It Was n
Lover and his Loss" and “Spring,"
were given a sympathetic interpreta—
tion.

"Long Ago, Sweetheart Mine," by
MacDowell, was sustained and had on
even color throughout. ”What the
Chimney Song." by G swold. and “The
Victor,” hy Kalln, were full or drain—
atic power.

“The $55!...ﬁéj’ippa”

THE STAR: A mere slip of a lass, a wholesome, sprightly, charming wood violet. How else can one ltypify Anita Stewart? Radiating the spirit of joy and nat-
uralness, imbuing all her portrayals with that subtle quality of “soul.”~Anita Stewart’s characterization of “The Girl Philippa," reaches the highest
point of her dramatic achievements. She has beautyishe has charm—she has magnetism. She is dainty in manner, poised in action and finished in

Her wide range and control of delicate emotions, her ability to register her feelings and thoughts so as to convey them to the and-

ience, her rare grace of body and her finely chiseled features not only make her the ideal Philippa, but America‘s most popular heroine.

THE PLAY: “The Girl Philippa,” from the pen of America’s greatest novelist, is a tale of two hearts told in terms of love, War, beauty and adventure, aglow
with color and romance, alive with movement and action, set in an atmosphere charged with secret agents society intrigue and blood lust—the magic
spell of the author’s genius has woven a splendidly delightful love theme that charms and pleases. ”The Girl Philippa” is as fragrant as the wild
rose. Its tempo is like the speed fire of a machine gun. The story plays the music of the heart.
