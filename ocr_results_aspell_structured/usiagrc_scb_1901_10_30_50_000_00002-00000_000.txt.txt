“Dr. Gates has as yet given no
positive acceptance or the offer
oi the presidency, reports to the
contrary notwithstanding. That
he will probably take tip his
work here is shown by the folloivv
ing extract from a letter lately re
ceived by one of the directors:
“1 called my people together last
evening and told them that I
must go back to my college work.
but should remain with them two
or three months to make the situ-
ation more helpiiil tor my siic-
cessor. So I am going back into
college Work, and in W'ashburn,
it we dare risk the climate for
Mrs. Gates.”—,Y/w IVns/zlntru
