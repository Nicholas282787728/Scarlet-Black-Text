by some ol’ the Union oﬂicers with
the result that sotne one hundred
pledges were secured. However as a
number oi these had previously
pledged themselves the total riurnher
is larger than the real number. At-

the end of last term were met on ev-

ion have been called bill at none of
them since the tirst has there been
anything like a quorum. At one
meeting only lino students appeared
whereas titty are required for a quor-
um. The communication closes as
tollows:

“We have tried mass meetings, pe-
titions and personal solicitations. The
results he hereby set forth. it' there
is any other means that can be adopt-
ed, we will be most happy to receive
suggestions. As the report of the
faculty committee clearly shows, the
present debt must be paid or athletics
cease in the University with the com-
ing spring, There is birt one way to
avoid this calamity, and that is for
the student body as a whole to take
an active interest in our athletic af-
fairs.”

Grinnell Institute.

The meeting of the Grinnell Insti-
tute for Jan. 13, has marked by a
great deal more life than has been dis-
played in most of the meetings during
the year. All the numbers were well
prepared and held the interest of the
society.

Hart opened the program with an
excellent talk on “Copyrights," de-
voting most of his time to setting forth
the imperfection 01' our present copy-
right law. Following this number,
music was furnished by a quartet
troni the Glee club, which responded
to a cordial encore.

Tire “Chapel Talk,” by Browtr, took
the term of a caretnIIy-prepared argue

McHose gave a careful and thorough
review of Kidd's "Social Evolution.”

Miss Thomson then favored the
society with a piano solo which was
enthusiastically received, and she was
compelled to respond to an encore.

The Track Department.

Before the season is under way it
seems advisable to say a few words
concerning the ﬁnancial needs of the'
track department. The management
has during the past week sent out to
many of the alumni a letter calling
their attention to the track coach fund
and soliciting contributions. Several
replies have already been received.
and we sincerely hope to receive many
more. For this appeal for ﬁnancial
assistance we have no apologies to
